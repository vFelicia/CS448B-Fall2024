05:08 - hi everyone if you heard a strange echo
05:11 - it's because i had the live stream open
05:13 - on my computer

05:18 - and into my computer and then out to you
05:19 - again so apologize i have fixed that
05:22 - and we are starting in about 45 seconds
05:37 - [Music]
06:10 - hello everyone good morning happy
06:13 - saturday welcome to the coding train
06:15 - it's me
06:15 - dan oh we're on the internet together um
06:18 - i'm so excited today oh i have an extra
06:20 - light that i need to turn on i forgot to
06:22 - turn this light on do i look better now
06:23 - this side of my face looks more uh um
06:27 - like it's supposed to i don't know what
06:29 - to say i'm so excited for today
06:31 - this is a special saturday live stream i
06:34 - have a guest
06:35 - um that i'm uh i'm super excited to
06:38 - share her work with you and have her
06:41 - teach me something or show me how to do
06:43 - something which i have never done before
06:45 - and actually let me just briefly get
06:47 - started by
06:48 - um saying and here's our guest up on the
06:50 - screen you see uh chrissy brimmage and
06:51 - this is a
06:52 - an image of her work but what i want to
06:55 - uh
06:55 - quickly tell you and say is i for the
06:57 - first time ever
06:59 - in my life installed something called
07:01 - blender
07:02 - on this very laptop this morning and you
07:04 - can see right up here on the
07:05 - on the top right of my screen there it
07:06 - is i just installed it because i'm going
07:08 - to try to follow along and
07:10 - you know or at least look at blender
07:12 - again a little bit later today
07:14 - so um if you want to get a head start
07:17 - and try to follow along with the
07:18 - tutorial stuff that we're going to do
07:20 - in about 15 minutes or so um download
07:23 - blender and there's a link to where you
07:24 - can download blender
07:26 - in the video description let me make
07:27 - sure it's there so i'm pulling that up
07:29 - now
07:30 - and you can see ah there it is so um
07:32 - first of all uh here's uh chrissy's
07:34 - website
07:34 - her instagram so check those out i'm
07:37 - gonna talk uh a bit more about chrissy
07:38 - and introduce her work and show you a
07:40 - reel of her work in a moment
07:42 - um as well as the link to download
07:44 - blender
07:45 - and oh this is really important because
07:48 - the example
07:49 - um that we're going to work with today
07:51 - is making your very own
07:53 - mew i don't know if chrissy actually
07:55 - knew this but i'm kind of uh
07:57 - uh you know i mean i'm out in the open
08:00 - about my love for pokemon
08:01 - so uh but uh there's a lot of pokemon
08:04 - going on in this household in fact i've
08:06 - got some
08:06 - a lot of toys and characters and things
08:09 - and plushies around that i could bring
08:11 - but
08:11 - i'll i'll save that for later but you
08:13 - can get this mew reference image
08:15 - and also
08:19 - make sure you download and install
08:20 - blender which is not required you can
08:21 - just watch and enjoy
08:23 - and participate but i encourage you to
08:26 - download
08:27 - uh blender okay um
08:30 - alexander asks will this be a tutorial
08:32 - on the software or
08:34 - is there going to be a coding aspect so
08:36 - today is not really the day that i'm
08:37 - that we're going to look uh
08:39 - at coding it's really like a basic
08:40 - introduction to blender and i think one
08:42 - of the things that's exciting about it
08:44 - is
08:44 - just about everything that i do is very
08:46 - 2d graphics oriented
08:48 - in p5 or processing so this is really
08:50 - also a bit of an introduction to sort of
08:52 - thinking in terms of 3d and you know my
08:55 - hope is that
08:56 - if i can learn a little bit from chrissy
08:58 - about how to use blender and it might be
08:59 - something that i add to my workflow and
09:01 - one of the things that i would love to
09:02 - do if i make my own pokemon
09:04 - u in blender maybe i'll see if i can
09:06 - export it and import it to a p5.js
09:09 - sketch or a processing sketch
09:10 - that would be certainly be a fun thing
09:13 - to try i'm just
09:14 - taking a look at the chat v specky says
09:16 - i love pokemon
09:17 - so darn much alright me too
09:20 - me too v specky okay
09:24 - uh so what i want to say like so a quick
09:26 - um quick just sort of like notes and
09:28 - logistics from the coding train
09:30 - so it's the summer as you know i'm not
09:33 - at my
09:33 - um nyu workspace where i record a lot of
09:36 - video tutorials
09:37 - so things are a little bit off-kilter i
09:39 - am doing live streams from this
09:41 - uh home location that i'm in in brooklyn
09:44 - um i recently released a video on
09:46 - marching squares
09:48 - um which is an algorithm that you can
09:50 - make interesting beautiful patterns with
09:52 - um so that came out yesterday um and i
09:55 - encourage you
09:56 - um to um if you make your own creative
10:00 - version of
10:00 - marching squares you can add there's
10:02 - only one community contribution here
10:04 - right now and i do hope to have a live
10:05 - stream next week
10:06 - where i will go through and look at some
10:08 - of these community contributions and
10:10 - show them and analyze them as well as
10:13 - maybe investigate marching cubes because
10:16 - today
10:16 - not so perfect i couldn't have imagined
10:18 - this better myself
10:20 - not planned but the next thing i wanted
10:23 - to try once i did marching squares was
10:24 - marching cubes which is
10:26 - taking marching squares from 2d to 3d
10:28 - but that's the topic of today going from
10:30 - 2d to 3d
10:31 - so that's what's going on in the coding
10:32 - train these days today
10:34 - is part of my guest conductor series um
10:37 - i want to also highlight for you let's
10:40 - see if i can pull this
10:41 - up if i go to the channel um the
10:43 - previous two guest conductors
10:46 - um amigos code and if i scroll back a
10:49 - little bit further
10:50 - um oh there there there she is um aaron
10:53 - davey
10:53 - from the twitch channel cozy cozy coding
10:56 - so check out amigos code uh channel on
10:58 - youtube
10:59 - and then uh aaron um live streams very
11:02 - regularly on twitch
11:03 - um making all sorts of what she likes to
11:05 - call i think like p5.js jan sessions and
11:08 - every every example that she's made in
11:10 - p5.js that comes out of that is just so
11:12 - delightful
11:13 - and so if you're if you're looking for
11:15 - more experimental creative fun
11:17 - with code and p5.js definitely check out
11:19 - um aaron davies um cozy
11:21 - coding train oh and we got a donation
11:25 - which means when we get a donation that
11:28 - i have to thank you with
11:29 - a random number because that's the weird
11:32 - stuff that i do on the coding train
11:34 - so i'm going to take my oh let me switch
11:37 - back to this view here oops nope wrong
11:38 - view
11:39 - here we go okay so i have my book a
11:41 - million random digits thank you
11:42 - anonymous for your donation i'm going to
11:44 - talk about the tender foundation
11:45 - in just a moment and for you uh i
11:48 - you will have your random number is
11:58 - ah oh no this book's falling apart
12:00 - that's terrible but we'll use the face
12:02 - excellent all right stop okay
12:06 - uh 98 0008 thank you very much so
12:09 - let me talk to you um about the tender

12:13 - um i want to thank chrissy who again
12:15 - i'll introduce in a moment
12:17 - for introducing me to the tender
12:18 - foundation i was not familiar with
12:20 - tender before
12:22 - the tender foundation is a
12:24 - non-for-profit based in atlanta georgia
12:26 - it's run by jasina almand founded by her
12:30 - and it supports um mothers in need um
12:33 - you know being
12:34 - a parent i'm not a mother i am a father
12:36 - is
12:37 - a really challenging and difficult
12:38 - wonderful thing but i've been so lucky
12:40 - in my life to be able to have the
12:43 - resources
12:44 - um to not worry too much about things
12:47 - like diapers and food
12:49 - and not everyone is so lucky and the
12:51 - tender foundation is doing some amazing
12:53 - work
12:53 - um in atlanta georgia to help um mothers
12:56 - so
12:57 - i i was i could talk a little bit about
12:59 - the tender foundation um
13:01 - all the donations that you make um
13:03 - through this
13:04 - live stream go directly to the tender
13:06 - foundation youtube through their giving
13:08 - program covers all the fees
13:09 - and i'm also going to match go i set a
13:11 - goal for 500 i'm going to match
13:13 - a 500 donation um as well so
13:17 - what i want to do is play you a quick
13:19 - video message
13:20 - from jacina almond who is the founder of
13:22 - the tender foundation
13:23 - to tell you a little bit more about
13:25 - their work okay so
13:26 - give me a second here hopefully this is
13:28 - gonna come up i'm gonna oh uh
13:30 - let me actually turn off the air
13:32 - conditioning which is making a noise
13:34 - i realized and let me click over to her
13:37 - video and i'm going to mute myself
13:42 - hi um my name is jacina allman the
13:44 - founder of the tender foundation based
13:46 - in atlanta georgia first off i just want
13:49 - to say we're so grateful
13:50 - to christy and the coding train for
13:52 - allowing us this opportunity and
13:54 - supporting our work
13:55 - at tender we are committed to empowering
13:58 - all moms by making the essentials
14:00 - accessible we do this through our family
14:02 - stabilization program
14:04 - the program provides emergency financial
14:07 - assistance
14:08 - with rent utilities um
14:11 - grocery store gift cards and other
14:13 - necessities like diapers and wipes to
14:15 - our moms
14:16 - we um we do this work with like a lot of
14:20 - heart
14:20 - and a little hassle we believe our
14:22 - process is streamlined
14:24 - simple we really just stand in the gap
14:26 - and act as
14:27 - a safety net for all of the um
14:30 - the families living on the margins that
14:32 - are typically under resourced
14:34 - and so we really just like to surround
14:38 - our our moms in love and really
14:41 - destigmatize the process of
14:42 - being vulnerable enough to ask for help
14:45 - and so yeah that's
14:46 - that's what we do and again i'm super
14:49 - super grateful for this opportunity and
14:51 - i'm so excited to learn something with
14:53 - chrissy so thanks so much
15:00 - all right thank you jay cena for your
15:02 - message um thank you for
15:04 - uh sharing your work with us and all the
15:05 - work that you do i hope that

15:09 - and help support the tender foundation
15:11 - we just got a donation thank you very
15:13 - much from japs
15:14 - um and a couple people in the chat
15:16 - mention they that they can't donate
15:18 - through youtube because it's not
15:20 - available in their country
15:21 - um i will mention that of course you are
15:24 - also welcome to go

15:49 - you for it personally um
15:51 - okay so um
15:54 - i think i am ready for
15:57 - the next stage here which is to
16:00 - introduce um i actually made like a
16:03 - schedule and it says like
16:04 - oh i never do this because i'm so
16:06 - disorganized
16:08 - but it says on next on my schedule is um
16:10 - an introduction to chrissy's work and
16:11 - i'm actually five minutes ahead of
16:13 - schedule which is amazing
16:15 - so um i'm well i'm gonna pull up um
16:17 - chrissy uh bremenj's website
16:19 - um thank you oh i forgot to thank psy
16:21 - who is the um
16:22 - which i should have done right from the
16:24 - outset who's the coding train um
16:25 - community manager
16:26 - i realize i'm not in the uh video here
16:29 - um
16:31 - oh we got another donation from stein
16:34 - ovid bratomer thank you
16:35 - very much a train whistle uh for you for
16:38 - that donation
16:40 - um someone in the chat is asking me why
16:43 - don't i use donation
16:44 - alert yeah i tried to hook it up so the
16:46 - lights blink with donations but i
16:48 - couldn't get that to work so
16:50 - um maybe i can figure that out for the
16:53 - next i hope to do more fundraising so
16:55 - somebody knows how to get the youtube
16:57 - api with donations it works for all the
16:59 - other kind of transaction stuff but for
17:01 - some reason the donations aren't coming
17:02 - up but that's not what's important
17:04 - it's nice when the lights blink but alas
17:06 - we will we will enjoy ourselves
17:08 - uh and uh your donation is really um i'm
17:11 - really grateful and thank you for that
17:13 - oh but uh most importantly um i wanted
17:16 - to thank psy
17:17 - who is the coding trained community
17:18 - manager sai is the curator
17:20 - and and co-producer of the guest
17:23 - conductor series
17:24 - um i was not familiar with chrissy's
17:26 - work until psy introduced me to them
17:28 - and so um i was so thrilled and just
17:32 - like marveling at the beauty
17:34 - on of different projects on the website
17:36 - and really excited i'm always excited
17:38 - when somebody
17:39 - who's practice is different than mine
17:41 - can share
17:43 - how they how they work things that they
17:45 - have learned
17:46 - things that they want to share about how
17:48 - their practices and and kind of explore
17:51 - their creative process as a guest on the
17:53 - coding train so
17:54 - um let me play for you um uh chrissy's
17:58 - reel so you can get a sense of her the
18:00 - kind of art
18:00 - and projects that she makes with blender
18:02 - and other uh tools
18:04 - and then i will i'm gonna also just read
18:05 - from her bio on the website
18:07 - so now her reel is coming up here um
18:10 - and so um chrissy is a multi-uh
18:13 - disciplinary
18:14 - artist living and working out of
18:15 - brooklyn by way of atlanta georgia
18:18 - and her work utilizes the opportunities
18:20 - and constraints of digital space to
18:21 - research social phenomena
18:23 - of the material world she's currently
18:25 - interested in the function of identity
18:27 - dreaming of futures beyond oppressive
18:28 - systems defining freedom
18:30 - reworking ideas of justice and how to
18:33 - integrate mediums such as illustration
18:35 - code design
18:36 - animation 3d modeling and vr to
18:38 - communicate
18:39 - explore and bridge my personal
18:41 - perception her personal perceptions of
18:42 - these issues
18:43 - as well as the variations in perceptions
18:45 - between different social identities
18:47 - so one of the things that i love about
18:49 - chrissy's website and the real is
18:50 - repeating here is that um you know i
18:53 - think when you
18:54 - are working with code you can get so
18:56 - lost in the technical
18:57 - and are working with digital media um
19:00 - but sometimes you can sort of forget
19:01 - like why it is you're doing that and
19:03 - on um chrissy's website i'm gonna pull
19:05 - that up over here
19:06 - um she lists these four questions that
19:08 - she's been asking herself what world
19:10 - do i want to live in what is identity
19:13 - and how is it used
19:14 - what does freedom be on depression feel
19:16 - like can we expand our perceptions of
19:18 - the world
19:18 - through vr embodiment and so these are
19:21 - such uh wonderful questions i
19:23 - i think it's a good exercise for all of
19:24 - us i should do this myself like after
19:26 - today is to like
19:27 - take a minute write down what are the
19:29 - questions you're asking about yourself
19:31 - the world uh and the meaning behind the
19:33 - work and the things that you're creating
19:35 - um so um uh without further ado
19:38 - i think i would like to bring chrissy on
19:42 - chrissy you're still muted but why don't
19:44 - you say say hello to me so i can make
19:45 - sure i hear you
19:47 - okay i heard chrissy now i'm gonna
19:49 - unmute her now say hello to the coding
19:51 - trade audience
19:52 - hello everyone okay and then i'm going
19:55 - to switch over to
19:56 - um the screen that i have that has
20:00 - uh your video so hold on so um there
20:03 - everybody should be sorry i'm kind of
20:05 - new at this technically with having
20:06 - guests
20:07 - so apologies for all the awkwardness as
20:10 - i was trying to explain to christy i was
20:11 - like
20:12 - don't worry if everything goes wrong
20:14 - that's kind of the point of the coding
20:15 - train
20:16 - it all goes wrong and we figure it out
20:18 - together so uh hopefully you see chrissy
20:20 - right now
20:20 - hi chrissy hi um is i don't know if
20:23 - there's anything you wanted to say about
20:24 - the tender foundation you brought um
20:26 - you you shared their work with me um i
20:28 - hadn't uh heard of them before that i
20:30 - missed or that you think would be
20:31 - important to say
20:33 - um not to put you on the spot sorry
20:36 - no um i just wanted to say that i know
20:39 - i've known jacina now for a couple of
20:41 - years and just the work that she does
20:44 - with tinder but even outside of tinder i
20:47 - mean she's a really awesome person and
20:49 - the tender foundation really does do
20:51 - a lot of great work here in atlanta um
20:54 - they did a lot for the protest as well
20:56 - like they are really really
21:00 - about the mission that they have put you
21:02 - know on their website and
21:04 - you know i wanted to bring them in today
21:07 - because um because they're doing great
21:10 - work but also
21:11 - it's a non-profit that is kind of here
21:13 - in my hometown of atlanta
21:15 - and i just hope you know we find some
21:18 - time and
21:19 - space and love to donate to them and
21:22 - help some mamas
21:24 - awesome thank you so much yeah and i
21:25 - know that atlanta i mean everyone is
21:27 - going through a hard time especially in
21:28 - this country with the pandemic and i
21:30 - know that atlanta has uh
21:32 - it's an ep epicenter now these days so i
21:35 - hope that we can
21:36 - uh give a little support we went through
21:38 - this we're still going through to new
21:39 - york but you know we're lucky enough now
21:40 - in brooklyn that our numbers have come
21:42 - down a little bit and i know that
21:43 - atlanta is definitely going through a
21:44 - rough patch so hopefully we can offer
21:46 - our support
21:46 - to the city and the community and
21:48 - especially those who don't have
21:50 - access to uh resources um who have
21:53 - little babies
21:54 - um that's really like i i'm glad to be
21:57 - able to do
21:58 - our small part my small part in being
21:59 - able to help for sure
22:01 - um great so um i don't know if you
22:05 - uh how i don't know what the best way to
22:08 - get started is but
22:09 - you know if i'm gonna uh if you're ready
22:10 - i'll pull up your screen
22:12 - shall i do that now yeah okay so i'm
22:15 - gonna switch where to see i'm
22:16 - i've got a button here i'm gonna press
22:17 - we're gonna see if this works so now you
22:19 - should be seeing um chrissy's
22:21 - um screen and we can i'm just gonna kind
22:23 - of like
22:24 - turn it over to you i'm gonna launch
22:26 - blender on my laptop and try to
22:28 - follow along and i'll ask questions
22:30 - along the way if there are things that
22:31 - i'm confused about
22:32 - and i'm also keeping an eye on the chat
22:34 - as well and thank you
22:36 - to nick k um with your for your donation
22:38 - to tender or not
22:40 - uh um you know i don't want i want to
22:42 - let chrissy be able to have some flow
22:44 - here so
22:45 - i don't know that i'm gonna pause and
22:46 - stop every time somebody donates but at
22:48 - the end i'll try to say some thank yous
22:49 - again to other people who
22:50 - who donate as well um and so if you have
22:52 - questions you can ask them in the chat
22:54 - i'll try to keep track of them but we'll
22:55 - also
22:56 - um have a little bit of time towards the
22:58 - end if people want to ask um some
22:59 - questions about to chrissy about
23:01 - her work or just working with blender
23:02 - and and the like
23:05 - cool all right let's jump in
23:09 - okay so first and foremost hi everyone i
23:12 - am
23:12 - super excited to be here um
23:16 - just a little bit of background on me
23:19 - um i actually when i was learning to
23:22 - code and when i was getting my
23:23 - background
23:25 - or trying to get my bearings with
23:26 - machine learning i lived
23:28 - on the coding train okay i was on the
23:30 - coding training like every day watching
23:32 - videos so it's really cool
23:33 - to be here and to share something maybe
23:37 - new to some of you maybe not so new but
23:39 - either way i think we'll have some fun
23:41 - today um the way that i'm gonna kind of
23:44 - outline this video or the kind of
23:46 - overarching goal here is that i want to
23:48 - try
23:49 - to get everyone kind of familiar with
23:52 - moving around in 3d space so if you've
23:54 - never heard of blender never opened
23:56 - blender
23:58 - saw blender and thought smoothies like
24:00 - you have no clue what it is this is like
24:02 - the perfect
24:03 - video for here we're gonna walk through
24:05 - kind of the concepts behind
24:06 - moving from 2d to 3d then i'm going to
24:10 - show kind of like how to navigate in 3d
24:12 - space
24:13 - and then at the end we'll go ahead and
24:16 - hopefully have some time to do a demo
24:18 - of how to model that new reference so
24:20 - like dan said if you are interested
24:22 - in following along there is a link in
24:24 - the description to both
24:26 - blender and also the new reference
24:29 - okay so first and foremost just a really
24:31 - quick note about blender if you haven't
24:33 - heard of it before
24:34 - i have the description here on my screen
24:36 - it's a free and open source 3d creation
24:38 - suite
24:39 - and it supports a bunch of things from
24:42 - modeling
24:42 - rigging animation simulation just
24:45 - anything
24:46 - 3d you can probably do in blender
24:49 - and that's specifically why i picked it
24:50 - today so we're not going to do any
24:52 - coding today but it has the capability
24:54 - to link encoding so if you
24:56 - do hard coding and you want to try like
24:58 - generative code
25:00 - you can do some of that in blender if
25:02 - you've been working in 2d
25:03 - but you want to move to 3d if you've
25:05 - been doing static work you want to try
25:07 - animation
25:09 - um if you want to create some obj files
25:12 - to put into p5
25:14 - dan has a really great tutorial on that
25:15 - already so there's a lot of really great
25:17 - things that you can do in blender so
25:19 - it's a really great transition tool
25:20 - which is why i wanted to talk about it
25:21 - today because it just kind of opens the
25:23 - doors
25:24 - to new explorations new mediums
25:27 - more dreaming if there's something new
25:29 - that you want to try
25:31 - one question that just came in from the
25:33 - chat that i thought i would ask is um
25:34 - somebody asked if
25:35 - um which version of blender or does it
25:37 - matter which version they download are
25:38 - you using the latest version
25:40 - for today we're going to be talking
25:42 - about blender 2.8 um i think they just
25:44 - released like an update like 2.83 or
25:46 - something like that but
25:48 - as long as it's blender 2.8 will be good
25:50 - got it
25:52 - okay so before i even
25:57 - do anything major i just want to give a
26:00 - note that
26:00 - for the first part here um while i'm
26:03 - talking about concepts
26:04 - i'm not going to note every single thing
26:07 - that i'm doing like
26:08 - functionality but if there's anything
26:11 - that i don't know
26:12 - when it's time to model i'm going to
26:13 - completely backtrack
26:15 - open blender again from the very
26:17 - beginning and walk us through every
26:18 - single step
26:19 - so don't worry if you don't quite know
26:22 - what's happening
26:23 - movement wise or function wise in the
26:24 - beginning it will all be explained
26:26 - later okay so let's talk about
26:30 - first just kind of the concept behind
26:33 - moving from 2d to 3d or just creating 3d
26:37 - work in digital space periods
26:39 - so the biggest difference and i'm going
26:42 - to actually pull up
26:43 - an example piece um
26:46 - so again don't don't freak out when you
26:48 - see this this looks a lot more complex
26:50 - because i use this for animation blender
26:52 - doesn't always look this scary i promise
26:54 - but i'm going to use this piece as an
26:56 - example um
26:57 - so the biggest kind of difference and
26:59 - i'm going to actually
27:01 - show the reference photo as well the
27:03 - biggest difference between 2d
27:05 - and 3d work are making 2d and 3d work
27:08 - is that when you are making 2d work you
27:10 - are creating the
27:12 - illusion of 3d okay so you're doing
27:15 - things like
27:16 - using your composition using shadows
27:18 - using foreground
27:20 - background to create the illusion of a
27:23 - full picture
27:24 - because you can only draw in like one or
27:27 - maybe two i guess depending on how you
27:31 - how you outline things perspectives okay
27:33 - so
27:34 - what you're doing is you're creating
27:35 - that picture in that one dimension
27:37 - and then your brain or the audience's
27:39 - brain is doing the leg work to kind of
27:41 - imagine everything else so for example
27:43 - when we're looking at this picture here
27:45 - um you know we see it's like a person
27:48 - and when we look at the head from the
27:50 - way that i drew it i mean hopefully
27:53 - we would imagine that it's like a
27:54 - rounded head so
27:56 - we look at it and we imagine that
27:58 - there's like a back
27:59 - um hopefully we imagine that there's
28:01 - like another ear these fingers that are
28:03 - hidden we imagine them there
28:04 - because that's what we're used to seeing
28:06 - in real life so the difference when
28:08 - you're moving
28:09 - into the 3d is that these things that
28:11 - are imagined
28:12 - what our brain usually does the leg work
28:14 - for we actually have to do the legwork
28:16 - in the 3d space so i want to show kind
28:18 - of an example of what i mean
28:21 - with this piece here so this is the 3d
28:24 - version
28:25 - of the picture that you just saw that i
28:27 - did so
28:28 - what's going to happen usually or at
28:30 - least what happened to me when i first
28:32 - moved into doing 3d work is that
28:35 - i'm so used to drawing in that one
28:38 - perspective that when you move into 3d
28:40 - work there's a tendency to kind of do
28:42 - the same
28:43 - to work from the front or to work from
28:45 - the back
28:46 - so usually what will happen is you'll go
28:48 - into blender you have your model you're
28:50 - ready you're like this is great this is
28:51 - going to be good
28:52 - you go and you completely model the
28:54 - front
28:55 - and then you expect or you're used to
28:58 - your brain kind of doing the legwork
29:00 - of completing the rest but then you turn
29:02 - the model
29:03 - and it's completely flat and you're like
29:05 - oh
29:07 - okay so like in our heads we know that
29:09 - there
29:10 - is a third dimension in
29:13 - 3d space but kind of moving
29:17 - and um working with that is what's going
29:19 - to be kind of the most kind of shocking
29:22 - thing when you first move into 3d so
29:24 - with this
29:25 - model i kind of got away with it because
29:27 - i only needed the front view
29:29 - but when you're doing things like making
29:30 - characters or if you're interested in
29:32 - 3d printing things where the model has
29:36 - to be 360
29:37 - you have to keep every single dimension
29:40 - in mind
29:41 - which sounds really really intimidating
29:43 - and it sounds like a lot
29:44 - but blender has some really great kind
29:47 - of features to help with this
29:49 - so i'm going to show just a couple of
29:50 - suggestions
29:52 - i'm i'm gonna open a completely new
29:54 - project here
29:56 - okay so this is what blender usually
29:58 - looks like when you first start when you
29:59 - have a new project
30:00 - as you can see it starts to go off with
30:02 - like this cube here i'm gonna use this
30:04 - cube to do
30:05 - a kind of demonstration of ways that we
30:07 - can set up our viewport here
30:09 - and our viewport is just the screen that
30:11 - you're seeing whatever you're viewing is
30:13 - the viewport
30:14 - so the first thing that we can do
30:17 - to kind of help us when we're ready to
30:20 - make our first model
30:22 - is use a reference okay so in the same
30:24 - way that references
30:26 - are super useful in 2d they are your
30:29 - best friend
30:30 - in 3d and what's cool about blender is
30:33 - that you don't have to like
30:34 - navigate back and forth so i'm going to
30:37 - go ahead and pull up
30:38 - the mu reference
30:41 - so you know usually when you're like
30:43 - drawing something you have your drawing
30:45 - here you have your reference off to the
30:47 - side
30:47 - or maybe on your computer and you're
30:48 - going back and forth trying to make sure
30:51 - that everything's right or maybe you're
30:52 - tracing it what's cool about blender is
30:54 - that you can drop your reference
30:57 - right into the viewport okay so i can
30:59 - just take this
31:00 - i can drag it and drop it right on in
31:03 - there
31:04 - and that way when i'm modeling i can put
31:06 - my model
31:08 - right in front so i'm just going to grab
31:10 - this
31:12 - also if anyone just joined um you can
31:16 - find that reference image if you want to
31:19 - use the same reference image there's a
31:20 - link to it
31:21 - in the video's description so if you
31:23 - scroll down you'll be able to find it
31:24 - yeah and one thing i want to note about
31:28 - references
31:29 - in for 3d space so i picked this new
31:32 - reference for a reason one because it's
31:34 - absolutely adorable
31:35 - but also because it has three different
31:37 - views
31:38 - so something that might also be new
31:41 - when you're transitioning from 2d to 3d
31:43 - if you're used to drawing in one
31:45 - perspective
31:46 - when you move to 3d again you have to
31:48 - have a full kind of 360
31:50 - understanding of your piece so things
31:53 - that are usually hidden
31:54 - in 2d you have to make decisions about
31:57 - in 3d
31:58 - okay so for example if you drew a
31:59 - character that is facing backwards if
32:02 - you draw them from the back
32:03 - you know usually in 2d you don't have to
32:05 - really imagine what their face looks
32:07 - like
32:07 - but in 3d you will so when it comes time
32:10 - to choose a reference you want to try to
32:12 - look for things like this
32:13 - like this new reference so something
32:15 - that has
32:17 - at the bare minimum like a front
32:19 - reference and a side reference
32:20 - but if you can find something with you
32:23 - know a right reference
32:24 - a left top bottom as much as you can the
32:27 - more
32:28 - references that you have when you're
32:30 - doing 3d work
32:31 - the more comfortable you're going to
32:32 - feel because you don't have to imagine
32:35 - anything that's not there everything
32:37 - will be there for you so try to look for
32:38 - references like this
32:39 - if you can't find something that has all
32:42 - three of them in one
32:44 - like let's say you're i don't know you
32:46 - want to make a reference of
32:47 - you want to make like a elephant or
32:49 - something you can't find a picture of an
32:51 - elephant from three different angles
32:52 - just try to find three different
32:54 - pictures that you like that are kind of
32:55 - similar
32:56 - that you can see it from the front and
32:58 - from the side at least and then if you
32:59 - can find
33:00 - other views from the back or whatever
33:02 - other angle it's gonna help a lot
33:04 - okay so right now my reference is in
33:07 - here
33:08 - um i kind of have it at a funny angle
33:10 - though so i'm gonna actually
33:12 - delete this i'm gonna back up
33:16 - and now so i keep talking about all
33:17 - these different views
33:19 - in um blender or we talk about how you
33:23 - know you can see a piece from the front
33:24 - you can see a piece from the back
33:26 - when you first go in blender you're
33:27 - probably like i don't know where i
33:29 - am like am i am i in the front am i in
33:32 - the back i have no clue
33:34 - luckily blender has views so
33:37 - we can and i'll go through this again
33:39 - when we go to the modeling but just to
33:40 - show really quick
33:41 - if you go up here to the view tab and
33:44 - you go to viewport
33:46 - it has all of the different views that
33:48 - you can look at so you have top
33:51 - you have bottom you have front back
33:54 - right left and you can navigate these
33:56 - using your keys so
33:57 - i'm gonna do that with my keyboard so
33:59 - now i'm in the front if i press
34:01 - three now i'm in the right you can even
34:03 - jump to opposites
34:04 - using nine so that way you always know
34:06 - where you are
34:08 - and it'll show you up here in the top
34:10 - left corner if you ever feel lost and
34:12 - click a button you're like i don't know
34:13 - where i am anymore blender will always
34:15 - show you in the top left here
34:17 - okay so now that i'm in the front view
34:20 - i'm going to go ahead and drag this new
34:21 - reference back in here
34:25 - okay and so usually what i do is
34:30 - once i put my reference in i move
34:32 - whatever like base that i'm going to use
34:35 - to model in front
34:36 - so i'm just going to do that really
34:37 - quick i'm just going to scale this down
34:41 - and again don't worry if you don't know
34:42 - what i'm doing i will explain all these
34:44 - keys a little bit later
34:46 - okay so i have this in the front right
34:49 - and now you're probably thinking well
34:50 - okay chrissy you said don't just model
34:52 - from one view though like we're only in
34:54 - one view
34:55 - this doesn't help blender actually
34:58 - allows us
34:59 - to split screens so we can actually
35:02 - model from different views
35:04 - all at the same time so there's two ways
35:07 - that we can do that one manually and one
35:10 - through blender blender will set it up
35:12 - for us
35:13 - so i'm going to show the manual way so
35:15 - if you ever want to split your screen
35:17 - so that you can model in different views
35:20 - at once
35:21 - all you have to do is come to a corner
35:24 - and you'll see
35:25 - the mouse turns into a crosshair and
35:28 - when you get that crosshair
35:29 - you just drag oh
35:34 - so there we go okay you just drag and
35:37 - it'll give you
35:39 - another screen okay so now both of these
35:43 - are in front because when you split your
35:45 - screen initially it's going to split it
35:46 - the exact same way so whatever view
35:49 - you're in in one screen it's going to
35:51 - duplicate in the other screen
35:53 - but let's say that i wanted to model in
35:55 - both front
35:56 - and maybe like right view so what i'll
35:58 - do is i'll come over to this right side
36:00 - here
36:01 - and i'm going to hit three okay so now i
36:05 - have the front
36:07 - and the right so when i make a change so
36:09 - let's say i decide to wrote this
36:11 - rotate this i can see what happens
36:15 - in both views at once which is really
36:18 - really useful
36:19 - because as you're modeling and you're
36:20 - getting used to
36:22 - what i call walking around the model so
36:25 - just
36:26 - making sure that we're using or viewing
36:28 - the model from all angles as we move
36:31 - is that again as you make a change in
36:33 - one view it's going to show how it
36:34 - affects
36:35 - in the other view so it kind of breaks
36:37 - you out of that
36:38 - one perspective kind of view and mindset
36:42 - now we only have the reference in the
36:45 - front view though so that doesn't really
36:47 - help us
36:47 - but we can do the same thing we can drag
36:53 - you can drag and drop our reference
36:56 - over in the right view as well so i'm
36:59 - gonna move this
37:02 - i'm gonna move this over some just gonna
37:04 - rearrange
37:06 - my is a little bit right now because as
37:08 - you can see they're stacked so i'm just
37:10 - gonna move this one back a little bit
37:12 - and put me back in front okay
37:15 - so now i can move my box
37:19 - i'm gonna grab it i had a quick question
37:24 - which is um so i noticed like this like
37:27 - for example the
37:28 - pressing the numbers doesn't work for me
37:30 - because i'm just on a laptop without a
37:31 - number pad
37:32 - and also like i'm using the track pad so
37:35 - i'm assuming are you using a regular
37:36 - mouse or some of the stuff you're doing
37:38 - like is that
37:38 - like is that recommended let me actually
37:41 - show you how to fix that thank you for
37:42 - bringing that up because that was
37:43 - something that was like
37:44 - chrissy make sure you know this but i'm
37:47 - so sorry
37:47 - so if you are on a laptop and you're
37:49 - like i can't move what's happening
37:52 - blender is built for using a mouse um
37:55 - and using like
37:56 - the three click system so using the
37:57 - wheel as a click so if you are on a
37:59 - laptop right now and you want to be able
38:00 - to move without a mouse and just use
38:02 - your
38:03 - trackpad all you have to do is go to
38:05 - file
38:06 - or sorry go to edit and we're going to
38:09 - scroll down here to preferences
38:12 - and then we're going to go down here to
38:14 - the input tab
38:16 - and then you just click emulate numpad
38:19 - so this is going to allow you to use
38:21 - the numbers on your keyboard and then
38:23 - you also click
38:24 - emulate three button mouse and that'll
38:27 - help you
38:28 - move around thank you dan for bringing
38:30 - that up so again if you are on a laptop
38:33 - and you want to be able to move without
38:35 - a mouse and you want to be able to use
38:37 - the keys
38:38 - that are already on your keyboard just
38:39 - go to edit preferences
38:42 - then we'll go down here to the input tab
38:44 - and then we'll click
38:46 - emulate numpad and then we'll also click
38:48 - emulate three map
38:49 - three button mouse and how did you
38:51 - delete the mu image that's one
38:52 - that i could get to work maybe i should
38:56 - okay so
38:56 - i was gonna wait to completely do like
38:59 - oh sorry
39:00 - it's fine i think it makes more sense
39:03 - for me to talk about the buttons that
39:04 - i'm clicking while i do this i'll just
39:06 - i'll just go ahead and say all the
39:07 - buttons on these things that way it'll
39:09 - make a little bit more sense
39:11 - okay so in order to delete what we'll do
39:14 - is you just click so a regular like left
39:17 - click
39:18 - and then you hit x and it'll prompt you
39:20 - here say okay delete
39:22 - and you just click it and then
39:26 - you can delete anything like that okay
39:29 - so i'm going to bring this back in
39:32 - really quick and just a note if your
39:34 - reference isn't coming in
39:36 - there can be two reasons why that's
39:38 - happening one reason why it won't come
39:40 - in is
39:40 - if you click on your object your
39:42 - reference for whatever reason might not
39:44 - want to come in
39:45 - so you just want to click off of it and
39:48 - then try to drag it in
39:49 - also if it's not coming in it's very
39:51 - possible that you're in a different mode
39:54 - so make sure to look up here and make
39:56 - sure it says object mode
39:58 - so if you want to bring in new objects
40:00 - anytime you want to bring in a new
40:02 - object whether it's a reference photo
40:05 - whether it's another mesh such as this
40:07 - cube here
40:08 - you always want to make sure you're in
40:09 - object mode okay so for whatever reason
40:11 - your reference isn't coming in
40:13 - just make sure we're an object okay so
40:16 - [Applause]
40:18 - again what i'm going to do is
40:22 - really quickly i'm just resetting
40:25 - everything to the center where this
40:27 - crosshair is and to do that
40:29 - all you have to do is press option and
40:31 - then g
40:34 - and with my scrim and do the same thing
40:36 - just press option g and that just moved
40:38 - everything down here to the middle
40:41 - okay so again on the right side here we
40:44 - are in front view
40:45 - on the left side we're on we're in right
40:48 - view
40:49 - and something else i want to note really
40:50 - quick too is that
40:52 - as you can see up here it says right
40:53 - orthographic
40:55 - and if i press 5 it's going to say right
40:57 - perspective
40:58 - so i want everyone to make sure that
40:59 - you're in orthographic mode
41:01 - okay there are two different modes in
41:03 - blender orthographic and perspective
41:05 - i don't want to explain that right now
41:07 - because it's very very confusing
41:08 - long story short you mostly use
41:10 - perspective if you're doing like
41:12 - scene modeling so for example if you
41:14 - want to model outer space
41:17 - you'll probably want to use perspective
41:18 - but if you're doing like character
41:20 - modeling
41:21 - anything that's going to use details you
41:23 - always want to make sure you're in
41:24 - orthographic
41:25 - okay and again you'll know where you are
41:27 - because blender will say it in this top
41:28 - left corner here and let me make this
41:31 - bigger sorry so you can see everything
41:34 - okay so again if you're in perspective
41:37 - just hit five
41:38 - it'll put you in orthographic mode okay
41:41 - so we have our reference set up
41:43 - in the right side and left side i'm
41:45 - going to move
41:47 - my cube over so in order to move it
41:51 - i'm just going to click it i'm just
41:53 - going to left click it once
41:54 - then i'm going to hit g which is grab
41:58 - and then what i want to note quickly
41:59 - before i move it is as you can see
42:02 - up here um this is kind of like your
42:04 - axis that's going to tell you
42:06 - kind of where you are in space or how to
42:09 - make a movement
42:10 - okay so as you can see on this side if i
42:12 - want to move right
42:14 - i'm going to move it on the y but on
42:16 - this side if i wanted to move right
42:18 - i would move it on the x and the reason
42:21 - for that is because we're in two
42:22 - different views
42:23 - okay so again if you're you feel lost
42:26 - you're not sure where you are
42:27 - first make sure that you check on the
42:30 - top left
42:30 - and then if you're like well i don't
42:31 - really know how to move then you can
42:33 - check on the top
42:34 - right just to try to figure out where to
42:36 - go
42:37 - okay so i'm going to come over here to
42:40 - this left panel
42:41 - because i want to move my box in front
42:44 - of this right view of mu or this
42:49 - the left view of mu he's facing left so
42:52 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
42:53 - click onto the box
42:54 - so just one left click and then i'm
42:56 - going to hit g
42:58 - to grab and then remember we're on this
43:01 - side so if we want to move right
43:03 - we're going to use the y axis so i'm
43:05 - going to click i'm going to hit g
43:08 - and then i'm going to hit y so that i
43:10 - can move it
43:11 - left or right and now i'm just going to
43:13 - move the box
43:15 - right over mu and as you can see on this
43:16 - side it disappeared a little bit that's
43:18 - only because my references are
43:20 - kind of crosshaired like this so i'm
43:21 - going to move this reference back
43:24 - this front reference here by clicking it
43:26 - i'm going to hit g
43:27 - and now this time if i want to move
43:28 - right again we're going to use that
43:30 - y-axis i'm just going to move
43:32 - back here okay so now on the right side
43:36 - where we're in the front view
43:38 - we have our box in front of the right
43:41 - meme
43:41 - reference here and on the left side when
43:44 - we're modeling in the right
43:45 - even though i guess technically it
43:46 - should have been the left but that's
43:47 - okay um
43:49 - we have our box in front of the side
43:52 - reference
43:52 - of mu so again as we make a change
43:56 - in one so if i come over here and i
43:58 - rotate
43:59 - and to rotate you just hit r so if i
44:01 - rotate on the right
44:03 - i will see in real time how it affects
44:05 - the front
44:07 - okay so this is really important again
44:08 - because we are working in multiple
44:11 - angles all at once
44:12 - and we always want to know how kind of
44:15 - what we do in one angle
44:17 - affects the other and on that note
44:20 - something i just want to note really
44:21 - quickly is that
44:22 - references in 2d don't always perfectly
44:25 - translate in 3d
44:27 - so everything here with mu you know
44:30 - looks up to spec
44:31 - from our eye because we are seeing it in
44:33 - separate angles
44:34 - but sometimes when we try to combine all
44:36 - the references we'll notice
44:37 - like maybe the arm was like a little bit
44:39 - higher in the front reference than it is
44:41 - on the side reference
44:42 - and maybe the ears are a little bit more
44:44 - back in the front reference than they
44:45 - are on the side reference
44:47 - so with references they are your best
44:49 - friend you want to love them you want to
44:51 - cherish them but
44:52 - you don't want to marry them you want to
44:54 - stay flexible because as you are
44:56 - manipulating different
44:57 - angles you're going to notice that
44:59 - things may not line up
45:01 - and that's okay you can just use your
45:02 - best judgment to make adjustments from
45:04 - there
45:06 - okay so this is our split this is
45:08 - usually where i like to keep splits
45:10 - because it could get a little
45:13 - a little tight in the area but you can
45:15 - actually split
45:17 - the viewport as many times as you want
45:19 - so let's say you have 16 different
45:21 - references
45:22 - if you wanted to split the viewport 16
45:25 - different times
45:26 - in 16 different ways you totally could
45:29 - so again all you have to do to do that
45:31 - is come to any corner
45:34 - and just drag up
45:37 - okay and now i can change this one to
45:40 - the back so now i'll know what's
45:42 - happening in the back and i can do the
45:44 - same over here
45:45 - i can just drag it up and i'll change
45:48 - this one
45:49 - to the left so now as i'm making a
45:51 - change in the front
45:54 - i will now see what's happening oh the
45:56 - bottom one is kind of blocked but
45:58 - you can see the point that as i move in
46:00 - one
46:01 - i know what's happening in every single
46:03 - angle
46:05 - okay and now if we want to get rid of
46:07 - these if you're
46:08 - trying to like grab and you're like oh
46:10 - no i keep making a million windows i've
46:12 - been here before and i panicked and i
46:14 - completely like closed out a project and
46:17 - started from scratch so i was like i
46:18 - don't know how to get rid of all these
46:19 - windows
46:20 - don't worry there's an easy way to do
46:22 - that all you have to do is come over
46:24 - just hover over the line where it gives
46:25 - you that two kind of arrows you'll right
46:27 - click
46:28 - on your track pad then you just hit join
46:30 - area
46:31 - i'm gonna do that again just right click
46:34 - join area and then you'll click which
46:37 - way you wanna join so you can join up
46:38 - you can join down and then again
46:43 - i'm just going to join all these i'm
46:44 - going to bring us back to two
46:46 - screens now
46:49 - if you don't want to do all the dragging
46:51 - or if dragging feels hard or maybe your
46:53 - trackpad doesn't work all that great
46:55 - you can also do this a blender will set
46:58 - things up manually for you
46:59 - so you can come up here to the view tab
47:03 - you come all the way down to area and
47:06 - you'll see a couple different options so
47:07 - we have
47:08 - a toggle quad view which will give us
47:11 - before again
47:12 - which that gave us four on one side just
47:13 - because i already had it split so then
47:15 - if you want to get rid of that you can
47:16 - come back to area and just hit toggle
47:18 - quad view again
47:19 - it'll get rid of it and there's also
47:22 - options for the horizontal split we have
47:24 - vertical splits
47:25 - however you want to split it blender can
47:27 - automatically do that for you
47:29 - this is also really useful if you want
47:31 - to start to make a transition
47:33 - into like animation or rigging or even
47:36 - when you're rendering um i can set
47:39 - for example i'm just gonna really
47:41 - quickly show you what edit mode looks
47:43 - like and again i will explain this later
47:44 - when we're actually modeling
47:46 - so on the left or on the left here now
47:48 - i'm in edit mode
47:50 - and i'm gonna make this one whoops
47:56 - sorry i'm gonna make this actually
48:02 - so this is a rendered view so i haven't
48:05 - made any
48:06 - changes to the square so you're not
48:07 - really going to notice the difference
48:08 - but like if i change the color for
48:10 - example
48:11 - which i can do that really quick just so
48:14 - you can see what i
48:15 - mean so i'm going to change this color
48:20 - to blue okay so as you can see on our
48:23 - left side we have the rendered view so
48:25 - when you start to do things like
48:26 - adding textures or adding colors
48:30 - none of that is going to show when
48:31 - you're in object mode or when you're in
48:33 - edit mode as you're
48:34 - reworking the mesh but if you want to
48:36 - see in real time kind of what everything
48:38 - looks like you'll be able to see it
48:40 - if you have kind of that split so
48:42 - splitting is really useful for one
48:43 - keeping track of how
48:44 - all angles look like at the same time
48:46 - but it's also useful in your workflow
48:49 - as you're creating things like the
48:51 - render or creating the animation
48:53 - you're just able to see everything all
48:55 - at once which is
48:56 - really really useful okay so i'm going
48:59 - to
49:00 - come back out of
49:04 - that rendered mode
49:07 - okay so i'm going to put us back
49:10 - in right and in front
49:14 - and i'm going to reset the rotation of
49:17 - this cube by just hitting
49:18 - option r so it's just going to clear any
49:21 - rotation that we did
49:23 - and i think this is a good
49:26 - point to start to move into the demo
49:30 - from you but before we get to demoing i
49:32 - just want to explain how to move
49:34 - period in blender one what one question
49:38 - came up in the chat and
49:39 - i wasn't gonna ask it because i was
49:41 - having trouble with it too
49:42 - i'm having trouble figuring out i have
49:44 - exactly what you have
49:46 - but i'm having trouble on the right
49:47 - panel the front orthographic view
49:49 - getting the mu uh the reference image to
49:53 - move behind the cube
49:54 - that should be along the x axis so to do
49:58 - that
49:58 - yeah so okay so we're in the front
50:02 - here right now we want to move this
50:03 - reference back what i usually do is
50:05 - i'll just kind of like turn to see which
50:09 - way it needs to go and
50:11 - these lines here correspond to every
50:13 - axis so
50:14 - this green one is y this red one
50:17 - is x you can't see the z one right now
50:20 - but the z is always blue
50:21 - so um since our y is the one in
50:25 - in behind the reference we're just going
50:28 - to click the reference
50:29 - and then we'll hit g and then we'll hit
50:32 - y
50:33 - and that'll allow us to move it back got
50:36 - it
50:38 - cool great question okay so
50:41 - let's talk about movement before we even
50:45 - start to make
50:47 - our mute okay so first since we already
50:49 - talked about kind of the views
50:51 - just to review if you want to change
50:54 - what view you are
50:55 - in you can either come up here to the
50:57 - view tab
50:59 - and go to viewport and it'll show you
51:02 - all the options
51:03 - or if you are a hotkey person you can
51:06 - come to memorize them and you can use
51:08 - your keyboard to just move around so one
51:11 - is front
51:13 - three is right uh command three is left
51:16 - i think command one is back and then if
51:19 - you don't wanna memorize every single
51:21 - one
51:22 - what i usually do or what i have done is
51:25 - i just memorize front and right so front
51:28 - is one
51:30 - right is three and then if i want to go
51:32 - to the back all you have to do
51:34 - is hit nine to go to the opposite so
51:36 - when i was in front it sent me to the
51:38 - back
51:39 - and now if i hit nine again so i'm in
51:41 - the back it'll take me back to the front
51:43 - and this will happen again with right
51:45 - view so if i hit three to go to right
51:47 - view
51:48 - and i want to go to the left view i can
51:50 - just hit nine
51:51 - that's going to put me in the left and
51:53 - if i want to go back to
51:54 - the right view just hit nine again and
51:57 - now i'm back in the right and that way
51:58 - you don't have to memorize
51:59 - every single key okay so that is moving
52:03 - views but we can also move in between
52:06 - views
52:07 - okay so if you want to look at three
52:08 - quarter if you want
52:10 - to look at the top and there's actually
52:12 - top buttons as well i think
52:13 - seven there we go seven is top
52:16 - and if you hit nine it'll put you on the
52:18 - bottom if you hit nine again
52:21 - it'll take you back up top but again
52:23 - there's angles in between top and bottom
52:26 - there's angles in between the front like
52:27 - sometimes we need to see
52:29 - some weird angle maybe like under mu's
52:32 - tail or like i don't know if that looks
52:33 - right
52:34 - you can move just by putting two fingers
52:37 - on your track pad
52:39 - and just moving about okay so this will
52:41 - allow you to rotate
52:43 - we can go up and down we can go all
52:45 - around
52:46 - and then if we feel dizzy and we're like
52:48 - oh gosh i'm seeing too much
52:50 - take me back to front we'll just hit one
52:52 - to go back
52:53 - but now you're probably like well okay i
52:55 - can rotate
52:57 - but i can't go left to right like how do
52:59 - i
53:00 - move left to right so in order to do
53:03 - that
53:04 - you just hold shift and use those same
53:06 - two fingers
53:08 - and you'll be able to shift left and
53:10 - right
53:11 - or up and down or diagonal
53:15 - whichever way you want to go okay so we
53:18 - release shift
53:19 - and just use two fingers if we just want
53:21 - to rotate
53:22 - around something and then we use shift
53:27 - in two fingers if we want to shift
53:31 - to the side shift up shift down
53:35 - okay so that is the basics of
53:38 - movement um so the basics then
53:42 - of kind of manipulating we'll talk about
53:46 - now
53:47 - so there are multiple modes if you click
53:50 - this tab here where it says object mode
53:52 - oh and that's actually not showing it
53:54 - for some reason
53:56 - oh there we go okay so if you click this
53:59 - tab here
54:00 - you're gonna see there's a bunch of
54:01 - different modes don't worry about any of
54:03 - those right now
54:04 - the only two that we're gonna worry
54:05 - about today are object mode
54:07 - and edit mode okay so again right now
54:10 - we're in object mode we use
54:11 - object mode to add in or take out
54:14 - objects okay so let's say that i wanted
54:17 - to add in
54:19 - a sphere for whatever reason we can do
54:22 - that either by going to
54:24 - this add panel up here and then you'll
54:27 - go to mesh
54:28 - and you can pick any type of mesh that
54:30 - you see there
54:31 - so add mesh and any mesh that you want
54:35 - to add
54:35 - you can go in there or if you are again
54:37 - a hotkey
54:38 - person you can just hit shift a it's
54:41 - going to bring up that same exact screen
54:43 - and then we can pick something here so
54:45 - i'm going to pick suzanne
54:46 - which is the monkey i think her origins
54:49 - are from i want to say silent bob
54:52 - something like that i don't remember but
54:54 - she's like blender's mascot
54:55 - so i just added in a suzanne here but
54:58 - now suzanne has nothing to do with mew
55:00 - so when i want to get rid of suzanne all
55:03 - you have to do to get rid of an object
55:05 - is to click it so you just
55:08 - left click you hit x and then delete
55:12 - okay so again we add with shift a
55:15 - and then we'll pick a mesh and as you
55:18 - can see there are other things to add
55:19 - but again we'll talk about that another
55:20 - day
55:25 - object match i deleted my um
55:28 - uh my cube instead of
55:32 - the the monkey so i can just so i could
55:34 - just do add
55:35 - add cube back in is what i would do you
55:37 - can add queue back in
55:39 - and if you are like oh it's no longer in
55:42 - the center so let's say for whatever
55:44 - reason
55:44 - you added it in it's like over here or
55:47 - something
55:48 - and you wanted to put it back in the
55:49 - center where that crosshair is
55:51 - all you have to do is to option
55:54 - g and that clears the location and puts
55:56 - it right back in the middle there
55:58 - because i'm going to get rid of that one
56:00 - so now as you notice
56:02 - when you add in an object so i'm going
56:04 - to add suzanne back in here
56:05 - it's pretty big at least it's bigger
56:08 - than our reference so you're probably
56:09 - like how do we make this smaller
56:12 - all you have to do to make things bigger
56:13 - and smaller is you just click
56:15 - so left click and then you'll hit s
56:18 - for scale and then you just drag up or
56:21 - down
56:23 - as big as you want there's other ways to
56:25 - do this you can scale precisely by
56:27 - typing numbers
56:28 - in you can also scale on different axis
56:32 - so right now i think i'm scaling on the
56:35 - z-axis let's say i wanted to scale on y
56:39 - all you have to do is i'm going to go
56:42 - ahead and click this again
56:43 - i'm going to hit s and i'm going to hit
56:45 - y
56:46 - and that's going to allow me and you'll
56:47 - see on the right side now i'm scaling in
56:49 - the y
56:50 - instead of the z-axis you can do that
56:52 - with any axis that you want to do
56:55 - okay and now let's say we have this and
56:57 - you're like i hate this
56:59 - how do i get back just with any other
57:01 - program to
57:02 - kind of redo or to go back to what you
57:04 - had previously all you have to do is hit
57:07 - command z or control z if you're on a
57:09 - windows computer
57:11 - and now we're right back okay and then
57:14 - let's see what are there some some
57:15 - basics um you probably saw me earlier
57:17 - rotating
57:18 - so again if you want to rotate it's
57:20 - going to be the same deal so you'll just
57:22 - click the object
57:23 - just regular left click then you'll hit
57:26 - r
57:27 - to rotate and then again you just click
57:30 - and drag
57:32 - and it's the same deal with scaling if
57:34 - you want to scale on particular axis
57:36 - so let's say i wanted to rotate on the y
57:40 - then i'm just going to hit y it's going
57:42 - to switch it
57:43 - i guess you can really see in that one
57:44 - let's say i want to do it on z
57:47 - then it then lets me scale it in a
57:48 - different way and now this is x that i
57:51 - just hit so now i'm
57:52 - rotating x now i hit y and i'm back
57:55 - rotating
57:56 - in y okay and again if you're like i
57:59 - don't want this
58:00 - how do i go back you just hit command c
58:04 - and also just to note when you find an
58:06 - angle
58:07 - that is perfect you're like this is a
58:09 - perfect rotation in order to keep it
58:10 - here
58:11 - all you have to do is left click again
58:13 - and that'll set it
58:15 - wherever you want it okay so
58:18 - those are kind of the basics of moving
58:21 - your object
58:22 - in object mode so now let's talk about
58:25 - editing okay so i'm going to get rid of
58:29 - this suzanne head
58:30 - again by clicking x and then delete
58:35 - and um let's go to
58:38 - edit mode i actually don't model with
58:40 - the cube but i'm going to show just the
58:42 - basics of editing with the cube and then
58:44 - i'll show
58:44 - everyone how i usually go about modeling
58:47 - so in order to get into edit mode
58:49 - there's two ways that you can do that
58:50 - of course so either you can click the
58:53 - object
58:54 - and then you can hit tab and that will
58:57 - take you to edit mode you'll know if you
58:58 - did it right because it'll say
58:59 - up here into edit or you can again
59:04 - click the object you can come up here to
59:06 - the tab
59:08 - and then you can just come down here to
59:09 - edit mode and again you'll know if it
59:11 - takes because it'll it'll display it
59:12 - right up here
59:14 - okay now that we're in edit mode you see
59:17 - that things look a little bit different
59:18 - you see like the little points here
59:21 - and the reason why is that blender
59:24 - is a vertex based okay so the way that
59:27 - we make
59:28 - models is by manipulating vertices
59:31 - you can also manipulate edges which are
59:34 - just
59:34 - any lines you can also manipulate faces
59:37 - which are just any faces created by
59:40 - connecting the edges and the vertices
59:42 - but the kind of basis is vertex
59:44 - manipulation
59:45 - and just in general the more vertices
59:48 - that you have on a model
59:49 - usually the more realistic it's going to
59:51 - look so i usually do low poly art as you
59:54 - saw
59:54 - in the real so i don't use a whole lot
59:57 - of vertices
59:58 - but if i wanted to make things smoother
60:01 - if i wanted to make things look more
60:03 - realistic to
60:04 - it's a material world i would just add
60:06 - in more vertices
60:08 - okay that's just something to keep in
60:09 - mind okay so let's talk about
60:11 - manipulating these so in order to do
60:14 - that
60:15 - there's a couple of different ways that
60:17 - you can
60:18 - grab and move your vertices
60:22 - okay so i'm going to talk about first
60:24 - the ways that we can grab
60:26 - so one the simplest way is you can just
60:29 - drag
60:32 - and drop and you'll see i guess it's a
60:35 - little bit hard to see on my screen
60:37 - but you'll see it'll highlight whatever
60:39 - you grab is now
60:40 - to be this yellowish orange color
60:44 - okay so i'm going to do that again so to
60:46 - let go of anything that you grab
60:48 - you just click off so you see it turn
60:50 - back black
60:51 - and then if i want to grab it again i
60:54 - can just drag
60:56 - and drop now there's other ways to grab
60:59 - as well there's something called
61:00 - uh box selecting which honestly looks
61:04 - the exact same
61:05 - but i'll show you anyway so if you hit b
61:08 - it's going to give you this crosshair
61:10 - you can do the same exact thing you just
61:12 - drag
61:13 - whatever you want over whatever you want
61:14 - to grab and drop
61:16 - and you'll see it highlighted okay and
61:19 - then to release we'll just left click
61:22 - and there's one more that you can do
61:23 - which i actually think is really useful
61:24 - called circle select
61:26 - so if you hit c now we're going to get
61:28 - this circle in the crosshair
61:30 - and if you drag it just allows you to
61:34 - kind of grab vertices that are not in
61:36 - the same area so if i wanted to grab
61:38 - like all of mu's foot for example and
61:40 - there's like a bunch of vertices
61:42 - i can just drag this circle select all
61:44 - over it
61:45 - okay and then to release it
61:49 - with circle select you have to press
61:50 - enter and then you press
61:53 - left click to let it go okay so those
61:56 - are the basics for grabbing but i want
61:58 - to show you all something because this
61:59 - is another
62:00 - kind of wall that i hit when i was first
62:04 - modeling
62:04 - is that i went and i grabbed
62:08 - uh i used the cube because it was what
62:10 - was default here
62:11 - so i was like yeah this is great i'm
62:13 - about to model i went
62:14 - i box select here or i dragged to select
62:18 - i grabbed this vertice using g
62:21 - and i moved it and i was like
62:25 - yeah this is great everything's going
62:27 - wonderfully
62:29 - the whole cube is moving and then i
62:32 - turned it
62:32 - and i realized oh the back the back is
62:36 - the back is not it's not moving at all
62:38 - okay so if you
62:40 - want to grab in a way that's going to
62:43 - move your
62:43 - entire 3d object so i'm going to ctrl z
62:47 - or command z to get back here if i want
62:49 - to manipulate
62:51 - all of the vertices on one side another
62:54 - trick that we can do
62:55 - is we can change this to wireframe mode
62:59 - so right now we're in solid view so we
63:01 - see every single face we see every
63:03 - single edge but if we
63:04 - click z it's going to bring up this
63:08 - wheel this option wheel and again don't
63:11 - worry about these other two here we're
63:12 - going to worry about just solid and
63:14 - wireframe today but if we click
63:16 - wireframes it's going to allow us to we
63:19 - get this x-ray view
63:21 - of our 3d model it's going to allow us
63:23 - to see
63:24 - the reference in the back but it's also
63:26 - going to allow us to grab
63:28 - any vertices that are kind of in the
63:30 - back i just have to say that is so
63:32 - cool i know it's so great
63:36 - i didn't realize there's so many like
63:38 - key commands it's almost like you're
63:40 - learning a
63:40 - whole separate language because i mean
63:44 - it's it's friendly and intuitive in one
63:47 - sense
63:47 - in the sense that you're sort of
63:48 - manipulating this 3d physical world but
63:51 - i imagine it must take a ton of practice
63:53 - to get all of the like
63:55 - key sequences it's uh in like i just
63:58 - keep making mistakes and like undo undo
64:00 - and do
64:01 - yeah is that was that your experience
64:03 - yeah
64:04 - absolutely i mean it took me i mean i've
64:07 - been i think
64:08 - 3d modeling on my own for maybe two
64:11 - years
64:12 - now and i have learned a lot of really
64:15 - cool tricks
64:16 - but there's still there's still so much
64:18 - to learn it's a really cool program
64:20 - though and
64:21 - there's a lot of ways to do certain
64:23 - things like
64:24 - dan and i were kind of talking before
64:26 - the live about how
64:27 - modeling is a lot like code where you
64:30 - know
64:30 - there's multiple ways multiple solutions
64:33 - to get to the same thing so
64:34 - even as we're moving through this if
64:36 - you're seeing something kind of
64:37 - interesting
64:38 - that i haven't talked about or if you
64:39 - just want to try something weird
64:41 - and of course i totally recommend that
64:44 - um the more that you experience
64:46 - experiment the more you're going to
64:47 - discover and the more you're going to
64:49 - find like a way that works
64:50 - for you so definitely feel free to poke
64:53 - around don't feel like you have to do
64:54 - exactly what i'm doing
64:56 - get lost make mistakes i'll make
64:58 - mistakes too
64:59 - it's going to be great it's all going to
65:01 - be great
65:02 - okay so we are in wireframe mode now so
65:06 - again if
65:07 - you missed that we started in solid
65:10 - so to get to wireframe to be able to see
65:12 - the reference and to be able to see
65:14 - through the model all you have to do is
65:16 - hit d
65:17 - and it's going to bring up this wheel
65:18 - here and even these have hot commands so
65:21 - you can hit
65:22 - z4 to go to wireframe if you don't want
65:24 - to learn hot keys
65:25 - all you have to do is click wireframe
65:27 - and that's going to bring us here
65:29 - and when we're in wireframe again the
65:31 - benefit here is that you're able to grab
65:34 - any vertices in the back that you can't
65:36 - see
65:37 - okay so for example if you remember when
65:39 - we were in solid mode and i grabbed that
65:40 - front vertices
65:42 - i only grabbed the front but now if i
65:44 - drag
65:46 - and grab so i'm going to hit g to grab
65:49 - all of the vertices are going to move
65:52 - so i'm just going to do the same thing
65:54 - i'm going to grab
65:56 - and click and drag hit g
66:02 - and i'm going to drag again
66:05 - and hit g so now if i take this back to
66:07 - solid
66:08 - and i turn oh
66:11 - the model is a little bit behind but you
66:14 - can see that v
66:15 - here let me just move this so you can
66:17 - see it perfectly
66:18 - let me grab this whole thing
66:23 - there you go okay i'm gonna put this
66:24 - back in solid and i'm just gonna move
66:26 - this a little bit to the front just so
66:27 - you can
66:30 - whoops
66:32 - grab okay i'm just gonna move it away
66:35 - from the reference a little bit just so
66:36 - you can see it but
66:38 - as you can see when we move the front
66:39 - vertices it moves the back vertices as
66:41 - well so whatever we did in the front
66:43 - corresponded to the back so whenever you
66:45 - want to move like a whole side of
66:47 - something
66:48 - you want to make sure you're in wire
66:50 - frame so that those back vertices that
66:52 - you can't really grab from the front
66:53 - get moved too i'm going to move this
66:55 - back just so
66:57 - you don't get lost okay so
67:01 - like i said though i don't often model
67:05 - with the starting cube i usually like to
67:08 - start with a plane
67:10 - so i think i think now's a good time to
67:12 - get into this mew reference so i'm gonna
67:15 - um i'm gonna start from the beginning
67:19 - i think i'm gonna close out i think i'm
67:21 - gonna close out blender
67:23 - i'm gonna start us up from the very
67:24 - beginning as if i was going
67:26 - to model this that way we can walk all
67:29 - the way through and i will know
67:30 - every single thing that i do and should
67:32 - we do that too do you think or like
67:34 - should i keep mine
67:35 - open like right now i have mine with the
67:38 - two new references and my
67:40 - warped strange mangled cube that i've
67:43 - been really enjoying twisting all the
67:44 - vertices
67:45 - i feel like i have to show it really
67:46 - quickly i'm going to show it people can
67:48 - see that i'm showing my screen
67:49 - you can't see it it's the problem
67:51 - [Laughter]
67:54 - but now i'm back now i'm back to your
67:56 - screen perfect i think
67:58 - do what makes you feel the most
68:00 - comfortable if you like what you've set
68:01 - up so far
68:02 - definitely keep it if you want to just
68:05 - kind of
68:05 - walk through what it feels like from the
68:07 - very beginning
68:09 - do that too whatever feels more
68:10 - comfortable is what i would encourage
68:13 - okay so i'm going to x out of blender
68:16 - now
68:17 - i'm not going to save this but don't
68:18 - need this
68:20 - okay so i'm back on my desktop i am
68:23 - pulling blender
68:25 - back up okay so this is what blender
68:30 - looks like
68:31 - when you open it any recent files that
68:34 - you have will show up here so you can
68:36 - just jump straight into them
68:38 - if you want to do a new file you can
68:40 - just go ahead and
68:41 - over here and click general if you don't
68:42 - want to click anything you're just like
68:43 - i want this box out of my way
68:45 - you can just left click off of it and
68:46 - it's going to put you in that starting
68:48 - screen
68:48 - as well okay so again when you open
68:51 - blender it's always going to start you
68:53 - off
68:53 - with a cube but then you probably notice
68:55 - there's two other things here
68:57 - so this here is a light and this here is
69:00 - a camera
69:01 - i don't i want to explain this but i
69:04 - also don't want to get too deep
69:05 - into this because you use these for
69:07 - rendering and we're probably not going
69:08 - to get
69:08 - to that step just yet but just in the
69:11 - same way that you kind of have to set up
69:13 - your composition in 2d
69:15 - how you have to set up your light to
69:16 - create certain shadows you have to do
69:18 - the same thing in 3d and you use the
69:20 - camera and use the light to do that
69:22 - but today we're not going to use that so
69:24 - i'm just going to get rid of these
69:24 - things
69:25 - so again to do that we're going to just
69:28 - uh
69:28 - left click on the camera i'm going to
69:31 - hit x
69:33 - and then we're going to delete it and
69:35 - we're going to do the same with the
69:36 - light
69:36 - by left clicking i'm going to hit x
69:40 - we're going to delete it and now like i
69:42 - said i don't use the cube either to
69:44 - start some people do
69:45 - some people use the cube to start some
69:47 - people use the sphere to start
69:49 - some people use a single vertices to
69:51 - start you can literally do
69:54 - whatever feels most natural whatever
69:56 - shape
69:57 - feels most natural and also what feels
69:59 - most natural to your
70:00 - model so for example if you're modeling
70:02 - like a snowman
70:03 - you might want to start with a sphere
70:05 - but i usually my bass is that i usually
70:07 - start with a plane
70:09 - so i'm going to delete this cube as well
70:11 - by left clicking
70:13 - hitting x and deleting
70:16 - okay now before we even pull the plane
70:18 - in we just want to make sure we are in
70:20 - the right perspective so remember when
70:21 - you're doing character modeling
70:23 - anything that you need detail honestly
70:26 - most models i would say probably
70:28 - at least in the beginning you're
70:30 - probably going to want to use
70:31 - orthographic modes
70:32 - only so to make sure that we're in
70:34 - orthographic we're just going to hit
70:35 - 5 okay and we're going to know that
70:38 - we're in orthographic because it's going
70:39 - to say it
70:40 - up here in the left okay so now
70:44 - i'm going to hit one to put myself in
70:47 - front view
70:48 - and we're going to bring the mu model in
70:52 - or the new reference i'm sorry so to do
70:54 - that all we're going to do
70:55 - is grab the new reference
70:59 - and drop it right in and another
71:01 - navigation thing that i forgot to
71:02 - mention is that if you want to
71:04 - zoom in and zoom out all you have to do
71:06 - is press the uh
71:08 - the plus icon on your keyboard to go in
71:12 - and the minus icon go out
71:15 - okay so plus and minus
71:18 - and something else i forgot to mention
71:20 - is that in the same way that you can
71:21 - manipulate your objects you can also
71:25 - manipulate your references so
71:26 - as you notice when i first dropped it in
71:28 - the reference was pretty small
71:30 - so i reconciled that just by zooming in
71:33 - but if you're like i want the reference
71:34 - to be bigger you can just click the
71:36 - reference
71:37 - by usual left click you can hit scale
71:40 - the same way that you would with
71:41 - a model you can just drag it big or
71:44 - small as you want okay
71:48 - so we have our reference set up in our
71:52 - front view
71:54 - now we want to at least have one other
71:57 - view
71:57 - i'm going to be honest with y'all i
72:00 - often
72:01 - set up my split screen and i will set it
72:04 - up in front view in right view and then
72:06 - what i usually do is i end up keeping
72:07 - one
72:08 - in a view and then my other view kind of
72:10 - just becomes my
72:11 - whatever view i'm in like i just move
72:13 - around a lot but i'm gonna set it up
72:16 - in the way that what we've been talking
72:17 - about and if you feel like
72:20 - you know the two split isn't what you
72:21 - want you can add in another split
72:24 - you can use just the one view so again
72:26 - whatever feels the most natural for you
72:28 - is definitely the way you should go
72:30 - about modeling there's no like right or
72:31 - wrong here
72:32 - all right so again if we want to create
72:34 - that split we can either go to
72:38 - we can go to view we can come down to
72:41 - area
72:42 - and we can click horizontal split or
72:44 - vertical split or quad view whichever
72:46 - one that you really liked
72:48 - or if you want to do it yourself again
72:50 - you just come up to a corner
72:52 - until you get that crosshair icon just
72:54 - left click
72:55 - and drag all right so now we have our
72:59 - split here and let me
73:01 - make this full screen again okay so
73:04 - i'm gonna make my right side front view
73:07 - again
73:08 - which is already in front view and if
73:09 - you're not in front video and you want
73:10 - to get there you just hit one
73:13 - and i'm gonna make my left side right
73:15 - view
73:16 - by hitting three okay now as you notice
73:19 - once we hit that right view we can't see
73:21 - the reference anymore but we want to be
73:23 - able to see the reference so
73:24 - i'm just going to drag another one in
73:26 - there again
73:28 - and in order to do this drag again you
73:30 - want to make sure that you
73:31 - aren't like grabbing this reference or
73:33 - grabbing anything so just make sure
73:34 - first that you just click off so just a
73:36 - regular left click off of any
73:38 - object and we just drag this new
73:41 - reference right on in here
73:43 - and now again this is like floating in a
73:45 - random spot
73:46 - so if we want it kind of in the middle
73:48 - where the crosshair is
73:49 - we're just going to left click it we're
73:51 - going to hit option
73:52 - and we're going to hit g that's just
73:54 - going to clear the location
73:55 - i'm going to do the same thing with the
73:57 - one over here on the right so i'm going
73:58 - to click it
73:59 - and i'm going to hit option and then i'm
74:01 - going to hit
74:02 - g and that puts it in the back now if we
74:05 - remember from when we
74:06 - had already split things like they're
74:08 - kind of just sitting on top of each
74:10 - other which can create
74:11 - a little bit of like cluster when you do
74:14 - rotate out of a view so
74:16 - if we want to move a reference back i
74:19 - usually
74:20 - move the front reference back so we're
74:22 - just going to click
74:23 - so this is the front reference here just
74:25 - click it
74:27 - and then as you can see once i turn it
74:30 - the way that i'm going to want to move
74:31 - is on this y-axis so i can move it
74:33 - backwards
74:34 - so i'm just going to hit g to grab
74:37 - and i'm going to hit y and then i'll
74:39 - just pull it on back
74:42 - that way they're not oops i'm like
74:44 - hitting my zoom screen here
74:46 - it's not letting me move all the way
74:47 - back okay don't hit g
74:50 - and then i hit y okay and then i hit one
74:52 - to put myself back in
74:54 - so you can see on this left screen here
74:56 - that this is
74:57 - uh the front reference so they're not
74:59 - like cross hair
75:01 - on each other okay so let's put in our
75:04 - object
75:06 - i got all of that by the way i just want
75:07 - to say yes
75:10 - you're doing great
75:13 - okay so i'm going to show you the way
75:15 - that i usually model as
75:17 - like i said i usually use the plane
75:20 - instead
75:20 - of a cube i usually don't like to start
75:23 - even though it sounds
75:25 - i guess kind of backwards i don't like
75:27 - to start with a 3d object
75:29 - in blender even though we're modeling 3d
75:31 - because of the fact that
75:32 - um like i kind of like
75:35 - to get there's just less vertices
75:39 - to worry about it's the short answer um
75:42 - to keep yourself kind of like
75:45 - um free from like manipulating something
75:47 - in the back that you didn't really
75:48 - intend to
75:49 - i like to use the plane because it is
75:51 - just that one so if i'm moving one in
75:53 - the front
75:54 - i know that i'm not accidentally kind of
75:56 - messing up something in the back
75:57 - which is why i use planes but again if
75:59 - you like the cube that you already
76:01 - started
76:01 - you can stick with the cube you can just
76:04 - start with one single vertice
76:05 - you can start with a sphere whatever you
76:07 - can even start with suzanne
76:09 - whatever feels comfortable for you go
76:11 - ahead and start with that
76:13 - so in order to get our object in that we
76:16 - want to start
76:17 - modeling with first we want to make sure
76:20 - we're in object mode
76:21 - so if you're in edit mode right now you
76:23 - can either come up to this tab
76:24 - and click object mode or um
76:28 - you can hit the tap button it'll put you
76:30 - back in object
76:32 - and once we're in object mode we're
76:34 - going to go ahead and add in our mesh
76:36 - by pressing shift a so that's how we add
76:40 - something
76:40 - and then i'm going to choose the plane
76:44 - okay now our plane got set kind of flat
76:48 - on the ground so i'm going to want to
76:50 - turn it
76:51 - so that it is kind of facing the same
76:53 - way that mu is facing in the front here
76:54 - so i'm going to rotate it
76:56 - so what i'm going to do is i'm just
76:57 - going to hit r because it's already
76:59 - grabbed and we know that because it's
77:00 - yellow so i'm going to hit rotate
77:03 - and i always rotate in the wrong
77:04 - direction so forgive me if i do this
77:06 - wrong but we'll figure it out
77:07 - all i'm going to do is hit d because i
77:10 - think we're rotating on the v and hit
77:11 - 90.
77:12 - okay that was the wrong way so i'm going
77:14 - to reset that i'm going to hit r
77:16 - and i'm going to hit x and i'm going to
77:18 - hit 90. there we go
77:21 - and that's going to bring us forward
77:22 - okay so again to get it to
77:24 - flip in the same way that mu is facing
77:27 - we'll just hit r to rotate and then
77:30 - we'll hit
77:30 - x because we want to rotate it on the x
77:33 - and then i'm just going to type 90 and
77:36 - that's going to bring it
77:38 - 90 degrees a 90 degree rotation and then
77:41 - you just hit enter okay
77:44 - now this is huge
77:48 - completely covering mu so we want to be
77:50 - able to see mu so again
77:52 - we're going to go to wire mode by
77:55 - hitting z
77:57 - and then we're going to go to wireframe
77:59 - so now we can see precious mu in the
78:00 - back
78:02 - and then we're going to scale down this
78:05 - plane
78:06 - because it's way too big for me right
78:08 - now so we're just going to hit s
78:10 - to scale and we're just gonna
78:13 - bring it down and i'm gonna get a little
78:16 - bit closer
78:17 - so again if you need to zoom in and out
78:19 - you can zoom in with the plus button
78:20 - you can zoom back out with the minds
78:22 - button
78:24 - all right now what i usually do when it
78:27 - comes to modeling
78:28 - i usually start with the body of
78:31 - anything
78:32 - i do a lot of character models i do a
78:33 - lot of like human models so i'll usually
78:35 - try to start with the body
78:37 - and then i'll move to maybe like the
78:39 - head and then i usually
78:40 - worry about limbs later so we're going
78:42 - to start with the body here
78:44 - i usually start with the very base of
78:47 - the body and then i work up but you can
78:49 - start at the neck and work down
78:50 - whatever feels more comfortable but um
78:53 - for this
78:54 - just for the sake of demoing something
78:55 - i'm going to start at the bottom
78:58 - sorry to interrupt you how do you get
78:59 - the wireframe again i thought i got
79:01 - stuck there
79:02 - you're fine so to get the fire screen
79:03 - you just hit z and it's going to bring
79:05 - that wheel got it got it
79:09 - all right so we are going to start at
79:13 - the base
79:13 - of mu so to do that um with our
79:16 - plane already selected and again we know
79:19 - it's selected because it is that orangy
79:21 - color
79:21 - we're just going to hit g to grab and
79:23 - now if you want to grab with precision
79:26 - you can hit g and then z and that's
79:29 - going to slide it like perfectly
79:31 - kind of up and down if you don't care
79:33 - for it being perfect you just hit
79:35 - g and just like place it freely wherever
79:37 - you want
79:38 - i know it's a little bit hard to see
79:40 - because mu is also white
79:42 - but i'm just going to place it i'm going
79:45 - to place it
79:47 - right about here i'm thinking i might
79:50 - change that
79:51 - but we'll replace it here okay now the
79:54 - way that i go about
79:55 - figuring out where to create new
79:58 - vertices
80:00 - is that i just kind of follow the curves
80:02 - of the body so if things start to curve
80:05 - i add new vertices so i'm going to show
80:07 - you what that looks like
80:08 - so first i'm actually going to set this
80:10 - at the very base of mu
80:12 - i'm not going to include mu's legs in
80:14 - there um
80:15 - so to oh and
80:18 - before we even can manipulate vertices
80:21 - we have to move
80:22 - into edit mode okay so with your plane
80:25 - selected you're gonna hit tab
80:29 - and that puts us into edit mode now if
80:31 - you hit tab and nothing happens
80:33 - a reason why is because it may not have
80:35 - the plane selected
80:37 - so if i hit tab right now i'm hitting it
80:40 - nothing's happening
80:41 - it's because the plane isn't selected so
80:43 - you have to have an object selected so
80:44 - that blender knows what you're trying to
80:46 - edit
80:47 - okay so we're going to hit the plane and
80:49 - then we're going to hit tab
80:50 - and that puts us into edit mode and you
80:52 - know you're in edit mode again because
80:54 - you'll see it up here
80:55 - but also all of the kind of vertices
80:57 - will become more visible
80:58 - in the object all right so
81:02 - the way that i do this again is i just
81:04 - follow the curves
81:05 - of the body and i manipulate the
81:07 - vertices
81:08 - that way so i'm going to start with this
81:11 - bottom one here i'm just going to drag
81:14 - and drop and i'm going to hit g
81:17 - and i'm just going to move it right
81:19 - about here
81:22 - and i'm going to click off and i'm going
81:23 - to do the same over here
81:27 - i'm just gonna move this maybe like
81:29 - right here
81:30 - i'm just gonna adjust this one too let's
81:32 - put it like right at the base
81:35 - okay and i'm gonna grab this top one
81:38 - and i'm gonna move it i'm gonna go
81:41 - pretty wide
81:42 - on this one because why not then i'm
81:44 - just gonna drop it
81:46 - and i'm gonna drag and i'm gonna grab
81:49 - with g and then i'm going to
81:53 - drop it okay so this is our very very
81:57 - bottom
81:57 - now we want to add more vertices and
82:00 - again there's a lot of different ways
82:01 - that you can do this but the way that i
82:03 - do it is through
82:04 - extruding so i'll show you what that
82:06 - looks like
82:07 - the way that we're going to extrude by
82:09 - first we're going to grab
82:11 - these top two vertices
82:14 - and then we're just going to hit e and
82:17 - that's what's going to allow us to
82:19 - extrude up
82:21 - you can really extrude any way that you
82:22 - want but we're going to go up because we
82:24 - are working on mu's body upwards
82:26 - so then we're just going to click to
82:28 - drop it i'm going to click again just to
82:31 - make sure i'm not holding on to any
82:32 - vertices
82:33 - then i'm going to do the same thing that
82:34 - i just did i'm just going to grab this
82:35 - left one
82:36 - gonna hit g to grab i'm gonna move it to
82:39 - align it with mu's body
82:41 - and click off and i'm gonna drag over
82:44 - this one
82:45 - hit g to grab i'm gonna move this
82:47 - vertice
82:49 - and then we're gonna do the same thing
82:51 - so we're just gonna drag
82:53 - we're gonna hit e to extrude and we're
82:55 - gonna go on up
82:58 - and click off to place it click again to
83:01 - make sure you're not holding any
83:02 - vertices
83:03 - you're gonna drag drop hit g
83:08 - and set this one to right about here
83:09 - maybe
83:11 - and do this again g to grab
83:15 - and move okay we're going to repeat this
83:18 - same process
83:20 - over and over until we get up back so
83:22 - i'm going to set this one
83:23 - maybe like right about here kind of
83:25 - where that curve
83:26 - starts to like taper another way
83:30 - again i'm going to drag grab place drag
83:35 - grab place
83:38 - do this again e to extrude
83:41 - put this right about here
83:45 - why not drag grab
83:48 - please drag grab
83:53 - place all right we're going to do that
83:56 - again
83:57 - i like two more times so i hit e to
84:00 - extrude
84:02 - i'll put it right about here
84:05 - i'm going to drag grab
84:09 - place drag grab
84:13 - place and do it one more time
84:16 - click shoot maybe right about here
84:20 - and then drag grab place
84:24 - drag grab place
84:27 - okay so i'm just gonna fix that
84:30 - firstly really quick okay so i'm gonna
84:33 - bring us back into solid mode just so
84:35 - you can see what this looks like so i'm
84:36 - gonna hit z
84:38 - i'm gonna go over here to solid just so
84:40 - you can see it filled in and then if i
84:42 - turn
84:43 - oop sorry i know that this looks like a
84:46 - lot
84:47 - just because our i'm gonna actually
84:49 - really quickly i'm gonna
84:51 - move this one i'm gonna move our left
84:55 - kind of reference back so that it
84:58 - doesn't get in the way when we do turn
85:00 - so i'm going to tab really quickly back
85:01 - to edit mode i'm going to grab
85:04 - our left reference here and i'm just
85:05 - going to rotate a little bit to see
85:07 - which
85:07 - uh which axis i want to move it back on
85:10 - so i want to move it back on this red
85:11 - axis here
85:12 - so that is the x so i'm just going to
85:14 - hit g to grab
85:16 - and then hit x and just
85:19 - move it out the way of this front view
85:21 - so it was about right here kind of
85:23 - blocking you
85:23 - so i'm just going to move it back that
85:25 - way it doesn't get in our way all right
85:26 - i'm gonna put us back
85:28 - in that right view and it wasn't hard to
85:32 - see
85:32 - right now but our
85:35 - model is still in front of that right
85:39 - whoops
85:40 - actually sorry i just realized we didn't
85:42 - do that but that's okay
85:44 - we'll we'll come back we're ready to
85:45 - move it because i don't want us to do
85:47 - too much at once so
85:48 - right now i'm gonna put us back
85:51 - in our front and our right we're going
85:54 - to hit
85:54 - tab to go back to edit whoops first i'm
85:58 - going to click the model so it knows
85:59 - where we're editing
86:01 - and we're going to hit tab to go back to
86:02 - edit and i just wanted to rotate it just
86:05 - so you can see what this is looking like
86:06 - so far
86:07 - so it looks like nothing kind of
86:10 - we have a front body outline but right
86:13 - now it's just that flat plane because
86:14 - that's what i picked because i didn't
86:16 - want the back vertices
86:17 - to kind of get away
86:21 - but now we do want muse body to be 3d i
86:23 - mean that's why we are in 3d why we are
86:25 - in blender today
86:26 - so i'm going to show you how to make it
86:28 - then 3d so what we're going to do
86:30 - i'm going to tap back just so we're in
86:32 - front view and it doesn't
86:34 - have to look at too much stuff all at
86:35 - once i'm going to
86:37 - grab all of these vertices
86:40 - just like this and i'm going to
86:46 - kind of turn it a little just because i
86:47 - want you to be able to see this all
86:49 - right
86:49 - actually i can do it in right view see
86:51 - that's why we split
86:53 - our views so we can see these things so
86:54 - i'm going to put this back in front just
86:56 - so you can see it in real time
86:57 - so i'm going to grab all these vertices
87:01 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
87:02 - hit e to extrude
87:06 - and now when we're in our right side so
87:08 - i want you to
87:09 - look at this right panel here if we want
87:12 - to move to the right
87:13 - we have to use the y-axis okay so on
87:16 - this extrude i'm going to extrude on the
87:18 - y so i'm going to hit e
87:21 - and i'm going to hit y and it's just
87:23 - going to bring
87:24 - all of these vertices back so now
87:29 - we have a bit of a body now it's very
87:32 - square
87:33 - but that's okay now
87:36 - kind of a cheat code that i want to show
87:39 - everyone that is going to help when
87:42 - you're modeling
87:43 - anything bilateral so anything like
87:46 - humans animals anything that's
87:48 - kind of mirrored from one side to the
87:50 - other there's actually
87:51 - a mirror it's called a modifier in
87:54 - blender that will
87:55 - help you kind of model the same thing on
87:57 - each side
87:58 - which is really useful for body stuff
88:01 - really useful really again
88:02 - for anything that's bilateral so that
88:04 - you don't have to make changes
88:06 - on both sides as you change one side
88:09 - it'll make
88:10 - a change on another side so i'm going to
88:11 - show you how to do that so again we have
88:14 - our body here what we are going to do
88:18 - is i'm going to click off that i'm going
88:20 - to come over here to our tools panel
88:22 - which i know we haven't talked about yet
88:24 - there's a lot of really useful tools
88:26 - here but i don't want to confuse
88:27 - everyone so
88:28 - today we're only going to really focus
88:30 - on
88:32 - this tool right here called a loop cut
88:34 - and all that loop cut does
88:36 - is that it cuts something all the way
88:38 - around okay so we're gonna
88:40 - and i'll show you what that looks like
88:41 - we're going to click loop cut
88:44 - and we're going to go over our model
88:45 - here and you'll see this line form
88:48 - and there's different ways that we can
88:49 - cut it if i want to cut it around
88:51 - vertically i can do that or horizontally
88:55 - i can do that if i want to cut it
88:56 - vertically
88:57 - i'll set it here and we're going to cut
88:59 - it vertically
89:00 - so that we can mirror one side on the
89:03 - other
89:03 - okay so to do that to lay your loop cut
89:06 - all you have to do
89:06 - is left click now let's say i don't want
89:09 - to write in the middle for whatever
89:10 - reason
89:11 - you can drag it as well i don't want
89:14 - that
89:15 - i do want it right in the middle so i'm
89:16 - just going to click left click right
89:18 - where it is
89:19 - and then hit and then we'll just go back
89:22 - to our just go back to your selection
89:26 - okay so now we should have a cut
89:29 - going right down the middle of mu's body
89:32 - okay so what we're going to do now
89:36 - is going to hit b to go back into
89:38 - wireframe
89:41 - and then we are going to drag everything
89:44 - on the left side of mu's body all those
89:46 - vertices
89:47 - but not the middle ones you want to
89:48 - leave the middle ones alone you just
89:50 - want to grab all the vertices on the
89:51 - left
89:52 - side and we're going to hit x
89:55 - and it's going to bring up our delete
89:57 - panel and we're just going to hit
89:58 - vertices
90:00 - okay so that left side should be gone
90:02 - now which probably is like oh my gosh
90:03 - what's happening i'm scared
90:04 - don't worry it's gonna be great it's
90:07 - gone
90:10 - we're now gonna grab the right side of
90:13 - mu's body make sure you grab
90:15 - make sure you're in wireframe so that
90:16 - you can grab everything including those
90:18 - back vertices we're going to come to
90:20 - this panel over here on the right side
90:23 - we're going to hit this wrench looking
90:24 - thing which is the modifier tab
90:27 - and then and let me move my zoom screen
90:29 - a little bit a little bit in the way
90:31 - you can't see we're going to go to add
90:33 - modifier
90:34 - it's going to bring up a million
90:36 - different things that you can do in
90:37 - blender this is one of the areas where
90:39 - you should definitely explore there's
90:40 - some really really cool things that you
90:42 - can do
90:43 - but for right now all we need is the
90:45 - mirror modifier
90:46 - which is going to be under generate so
90:48 - come down here and
90:50 - hit mirror and bam now
90:53 - mu's body is back on the other side so
90:56 - as
90:56 - i change one thing so if i take this one
90:59 - and i move it
91:00 - it's going to happen on the other side
91:02 - as well okay so as we're trying to get
91:03 - that body perfect
91:04 - now we only have to worry about one side
91:07 - and the other side the mirror modifier
91:08 - will do the rest of the leg work
91:10 - so i'm just curious so that wasn't
91:13 - entirely
91:15 - necessary because we had vertices for
91:17 - the other side
91:18 - but because we were doing it manually it
91:21 - wasn't necessarily like perfectly
91:22 - symmetrical
91:23 - so now by like deleting it mirroring it
91:25 - it's like it's kind of like a cleanup
91:26 - step
91:27 - yeah it's definitely not necessary it's
91:30 - just if you want to keep things perfect
91:32 - which i don't always do this honestly i
91:35 - will usually go in and adjust
91:36 - every single vertice one by one by hand
91:39 - it's
91:39 - totally not necessary so if you want to
91:42 - just have like a quicker way to do that
91:44 - um if you wanted to just model half of
91:46 - it
91:47 - this is the mirror modifier is a really
91:49 - great way to make sure you don't have to
91:50 - do
91:51 - as much work as you would if you do it
91:53 - manually
91:55 - okay so now that we have our mirror
91:57 - modifier on there
91:59 - i just want to note that once you delete
92:01 - that you know
92:02 - i can't manipulate the left side on my
92:06 - own now
92:07 - just whatever happens on the right side
92:08 - is what's going to get kind of moved
92:10 - to the left side okay so just keep that
92:12 - in mind that if you're like i can't grab
92:14 - anything on the left side
92:15 - it's because it's being mirrored so we
92:17 - can only manipulate things on the right
92:18 - side now
92:20 - okay so what we're gonna do
92:24 - is we're gonna start to i think make
92:26 - this body a little bit more realistic
92:29 - now what i also want to keep in mind or
92:31 - just note when it comes to 3d work
92:34 - is that when you are rendering things
92:36 - you don't want to do
92:38 - every single detail in one view
92:41 - because once you move to another view
92:44 - what's it's going to get kind of
92:46 - manipulated and change so you want to
92:48 - capture
92:49 - the shapes of things in these kind of
92:52 - initial stages so
92:53 - just like how we did we captured the
92:55 - shape of the body but i don't want to go
92:56 - in and like add the arms and then like
92:59 - make sure his body is completely like
93:01 - perfect because once i start to model
93:03 - from like the back
93:04 - or model on the side that's going to get
93:06 - changed
93:07 - a lot so make sure you're capturing the
93:10 - shape but don't do
93:11 - every single detail just yet because
93:13 - it's going to get kind of like
93:15 - manipulated kind of later on okay so
93:19 - right now we have like this really
93:21 - square
93:22 - kind of thing going on it's not really
93:25 - that cute
93:26 - and mu as we know is like more rounded
93:29 - so we're going to do first i'm going to
93:30 - take us back into solid mode by hitting
93:33 - z
93:34 - and then going solid just so we can see
93:36 - and
93:37 - like i said earlier the way to get
93:39 - things more realistic the way to get
93:41 - things rounder
93:42 - is by adding in more vertices so that's
93:44 - what i'm going to do now
93:46 - with another loop cut so i'm going to go
93:49 - over here to the panel
93:50 - i'm going to click loop cut and i'm
93:52 - thinking i'm going to cut it
93:55 - in the middle here and then i'm just
93:58 - going to hit
93:59 - click to land it and i'm going to go
94:01 - back here
94:02 - and what i'm going to do is
94:06 - i'm going to scale this a little bit so
94:08 - i'm going to hit s
94:11 - whoops and i'm going to scale it on
94:15 - actually i don't like how that's
94:17 - happening
94:18 - i'm going to let's see
94:25 - hmm okay so instead of doing that i
94:28 - think what i'm going to do instead
94:30 - is i'm going to actually take this front
94:31 - part and i'm just going to kind of like
94:34 - shift it a little bit to the front so
94:36 - that it is like
94:37 - creating a more rounder effect so to do
94:40 - that i'm going to click
94:42 - these vertices here now what you're
94:44 - going to notice that as you click
94:45 - vertices
94:46 - you're going to like lose the other one
94:47 - so if you want to grab multiple
94:49 - you'll left click and then hold down
94:50 - shift
94:52 - so i'm just going to grab this front
94:54 - line here
94:57 - i think and then i'm thinking
95:01 - i'm just going to hit grab i'm just
95:02 - going to kind of like
95:04 - move it in a bit oops
95:10 - sorry my computer is freezing sorry
95:15 - my computer's a little bit old and
95:18 - actually i'm going to go back to
95:19 - wireframe just so i can see
95:22 - i just want to make sure i'm not
95:23 - grabbing anything i don't need to grab
95:28 - so that looks fine i'm gonna go back to
95:30 - solid
95:32 - and it's gonna
95:36 - i like that extra point here for some
95:39 - reason
95:41 - so let's go to wireframe and grab i'm
95:44 - just going to circle select
95:46 - these
95:49 - and hopefully i'm going to unselect
95:54 - these by grabbing oh
95:58 - oh boy how did you circle select again
96:01 - what's the
96:02 - looks like you just hit c c okay got it
96:05 - you get bigger or smaller by um
96:08 - two fingers just dragging up and down so
96:10 - if i want to make
96:11 - this pretty small
96:15 - oh okay and then i'm going to
96:19 - i'm going to drag here and then you hit
96:21 - enter to get rid of the crosshair
96:24 - but like i don't want these so i'm going
96:26 - to click
96:28 - okay and let's see if that'll
96:32 - there we go okay so i'm just kind of
96:34 - like pulling it in
96:36 - just a little to get like that initial
96:38 - like
96:40 - roundness it's not round yet because
96:42 - we're gonna have to add more vertices
96:43 - but i'm just kind of pulling it in
96:46 - just to have it be a little less square
96:49 - you know it's very very square right now
96:51 - and that's not really what we want so
96:52 - i'm going to do the same
96:54 - on this side i'm just holding shift
96:57 - to grab multiple vertices at once i'm
97:00 - going to grab all these
97:03 - and then again i'm just gonna hit grab
97:06 - just kind of just push it in a little
97:08 - bit
97:09 - and we have just like some roundness
97:12 - again it's not gonna be perfect in the
97:13 - beginning but that's okay we don't need
97:15 - it to be perfect in the beginning
97:16 - we just want to try to begin to capture
97:18 - the shape now something i want to note
97:20 - that
97:20 - you might be seeing as you move vertices
97:23 - because of the mirror modifier
97:25 - you're going to start to get gaps kind
97:27 - of here in the
97:28 - kind of center where it was split don't
97:31 - worry about that though we can merge
97:33 - them back together
97:34 - in the end so if you're noticing like
97:36 - splits it's not a mistake
97:38 - it's just kind of like an effect of the
97:40 - mirror modifier
97:43 - okay so it's looking a little funky
97:47 - right now but again that's okay we don't
97:50 - want to
97:50 - add in all the details and have it be
97:52 - super perfect
97:53 - just yet because we need to add in like
97:56 - the head we need to add in the feet and
97:57 - that's going to
97:58 - require like us to keep it basic so that
98:01 - when we attach things
98:03 - things don't get too funky okay so
98:06 - what i want to do is first i just
98:09 - noticed that
98:10 - over here on our right side our model
98:13 - isn't aligned on the right so let's just
98:14 - first
98:15 - move that really quick okay so we can
98:18 - actually move it in edit mode we don't
98:20 - have to go back to object to move it
98:22 - i'm just going to go to wireframe just
98:24 - to make sure that i'm grabbing all of it
98:27 - and then i'm going to hit g and then i'm
98:30 - gonna hit
98:31 - y and then i'm just gonna
98:35 - move it in front again it's not perfect
98:38 - right now
98:38 - we're gonna have to like we're probably
98:40 - gonna have to rotate it
98:41 - because mu's body's got to rotate uh
98:44 - we're gonna have to like re-manipulate
98:46 - stuff
98:46 - but that's okay we just want to know
98:48 - where we're at right now
98:50 - so before i do any more
98:54 - kind of like body work again i don't
98:56 - like to get too detailed
98:58 - in the beginning because we have to
99:00 - attach
99:01 - other things so i want us to move to the
99:04 - head
99:05 - so to do that we there's multiple ways
99:08 - we can do this but for me in order to
99:10 - stay
99:10 - kind of like clean or to keep my
99:13 - viewport clean
99:15 - i'll usually kind of hide objects and i
99:17 - i like to model separately
99:19 - you can model different parts all
99:21 - together so if i wanted to take
99:23 - this top part and like grab these faces
99:26 - so i can do a face select i can grab
99:29 - these
99:30 - and i can like extrude and i can start
99:32 - to do the neck of the head
99:34 - i don't like to do that because it can
99:36 - get really like
99:37 - and get really finicky in there and it's
99:39 - just it never really goes
99:41 - super smooth for me when i do that so
99:43 - instead i like to create a whole new
99:46 - object okay so what i'm going to do
99:49 - is i'm going to hit tab to go back into
99:52 - object mode because we want to add a new
99:55 - object
99:57 - okay and what i'm going to do is i'm
99:58 - going to hide
100:00 - the body so to do that up here
100:03 - in the top right corner you'll see steam
100:05 - collection and that has
100:07 - everything that we've put in our scene
100:09 - listed and you can use these little eyes
100:11 - to show or to hide them so
100:14 - uh the plane here or whatever shape you
100:17 - use
100:18 - if you use a sphere it'll say sphere if
100:19 - you use a cube and say cube
100:21 - is going to be our body and we can if
100:23 - you want to rename it just so you can
100:24 - keep track
100:25 - you can double click it and just go
100:27 - ahead and name it body
100:28 - or whatever you want to name it and then
100:31 - i'm going to go ahead and just
100:32 - hide it that way we don't have to worry
100:35 - about it as we do
100:36 - our head okay so
100:39 - to do our head we're going to do
100:43 - kind of same exact thing that we did for
100:45 - the body so we're just going to start
100:47 - by hitting shift a to add in whatever
100:51 - shape you want to use
100:52 - to make the head i'm going to use a
100:55 - plane again
100:55 - just because what i like it's going to
100:58 - put that plane in there but again it
101:00 - puts it flat
101:01 - so when we want to turn it we're just
101:03 - going to hit r to rotate
101:05 - we're going to hit x and then we're
101:07 - going to hit 90
101:08 - and then we're going to hit enter okay
101:11 - and then we'll hit
101:12 - v if you want to see it wireframe
101:16 - and then we can hit s to go ahead and
101:19 - scale it down and i'm gonna place it i'm
101:22 - gonna hit g
101:24 - and i'm just gonna place it kind of
101:26 - arbitrarily
101:27 - in front of him now before i start
101:30 - moving
101:30 - dan i notice we're at 12 40.
101:35 - and we're not super far in the model but
101:38 - i just want to
101:39 - see how we're feeling time wise
101:43 - how much i don't know
101:46 - i think so i mean i don't have a
101:50 - super strong opinion i'm happy to go for
101:52 - longer the audience seems to be enjoying
101:54 - this
101:54 - i think maybe though it might be good
101:55 - what we could try to do is just get
101:58 - um like a basic version of the head
102:00 - which is kind of
102:02 - similar to what you did with the body we
102:03 - can move quickly through that okay and
102:05 - then
102:06 - and then i think the most important
102:07 - thing is for people then to learn how to
102:10 - like
102:11 - save and even like share it in a way
102:15 - because then
102:15 - um what i would love if for people
102:17 - watching i'm going to do this myself
102:19 - if you work on your mew or whatever
102:21 - model you're making
102:22 - throughout the day or the weekend maybe
102:24 - there's a way we can just share it with
102:26 - each other on social media i mean that
102:27 - could just be a screenshot
102:28 - but even if there's a way to like export
102:30 - um export directly from blender
102:33 - like something i wonder if there's a way
102:36 - i know we're not covering animation but
102:37 - is there a way to like make like
102:39 - really quickly export just like a your
102:41 - model spinning around
102:43 - video but that's like a complicated
102:45 - thing
102:46 - yes there is i mean there's definitely a
102:49 - way to do it
102:50 - as far as is it simple yeah well maybe
102:53 - just an image just an image of the model
102:55 - yeah i can definitely show how to
102:57 - because i've already completed a muse so
102:59 - i can
102:59 - pull to show how to right right we can
103:02 - look at that and then also like
103:03 - even if just export as to like obj or
103:05 - whatever the
103:06 - yeah what file format is because one of
103:08 - the things that i and
103:10 - next time i live stream is try to import
103:12 - it into processing or p5 and see how
103:14 - that goes
103:14 - right for sure okay cool yeah let's do
103:17 - that and i definitely want to make sure
103:18 - that we have time for like questions
103:20 - right right here there are questions
103:23 - yeah so let's move towards wrapping up
103:24 - we can add the head
103:26 - and then we will have like a mewtwo is
103:28 - just like
103:29 - body and head and exercise for the
103:30 - viewer is
103:32 - try to add the feet and i guess the tail
103:35 - would be
103:35 - is like a really high degree of
103:36 - difficulty but try now that would be
103:38 - cool
103:39 - the tail i actually really this was
103:41 - actually the first time i ever modeled
103:42 - the tail and i actually really enjoyed
103:43 - doing the tails
103:44 - the thing that gave me the most trouble
103:46 - is like actually these little arms
103:47 - like they're just so small right
103:50 - harmless an armless mew
103:52 - is okay i think so honestly
103:55 - okay so let's get the head so again
103:57 - we're gonna do
103:58 - the head the same exact way that we did
104:01 - the body so we're gonna start just by
104:04 - grabbing it with g
104:06 - we're going to move it to the base here
104:09 - and then we're going to hit tab to go
104:11 - into edit mode
104:13 - and then we're just going to start
104:14 - manipulating the vertices alright so
104:16 - we're going to drag
104:17 - and grab with g move it
104:21 - i'm going to put it i want to make sure
104:23 - i capture the nose
104:25 - so i'm going to put it all right about
104:27 - here it's going to drag
104:29 - grab drag
104:34 - and i'll put it right about here for now
104:37 - drag
104:39 - grab and then we'll take these top two
104:44 - and we're gonna extrude with e
104:48 - okay and then we're going to drag and
104:50 - grab
104:52 - i might actually lower this i might
104:54 - adjust this later but that's okay this
104:55 - is good for now
104:57 - g to grab again
105:01 - and then we are going to drag again and
105:04 - then hit e to extrude
105:08 - g to grab g
105:11 - to grab
105:15 - and what i want to note so mu has ears
105:17 - and eyes
105:18 - as you can see but these are things that
105:20 - we want to add after
105:22 - we kind of get the base of the head so
105:25 - as you're extruding
105:26 - up and trying to capture you know mu
105:28 - shape
105:29 - i'm gonna actually move these down um
105:31 - don't worry about the eyes
105:32 - and don't worry about the ears just yet
105:35 - we'll add those in
105:37 - a little bit later
105:40 - i'm just gonna move these down just
105:42 - wanna capture more of his
105:44 - curves all right we're going to do the
105:46 - same thing
105:47 - and go ahead and hit e i'm going to do
105:50 - it like right at the base of the ear
105:51 - there i think
105:54 - g to grab g2 grab
105:58 - do this again
106:01 - and right about there
106:04 - g to grab
106:08 - g to grab
106:11 - i'll probably do this like two more
106:13 - times we're going to hit e to extrude
106:14 - again
106:18 - g to grab
106:21 - g to grab
106:25 - extrude one more time
106:29 - and then g to grab place it right about
106:32 - there
106:33 - and g to grab
106:37 - right about there okay so
106:41 - if we go to solid view this is what it
106:43 - looks like
106:45 - it captures the head pretty well i mean
106:46 - there are some gaps kind of down here
106:48 - that we can fix later on when we do more
106:51 - detail or if you want to add it in now
106:52 - you can
106:54 - um it's not something you really have to
106:55 - worry about right now we just kind of
106:56 - have that basic geometry of the head
107:00 - and uh what we're gonna do
107:03 - is we're gonna extrude it
107:06 - okay so we are going to
107:09 - grab all of the vertices here
107:13 - and i just noticed i keep accidentally
107:15 - moving it on the right so don't be like
107:17 - me
107:17 - like i said i tend to kind of focus on
107:20 - one viewport but if you want to make
107:22 - sure that you are using both of your
107:24 - ports just you just want to make sure
107:25 - that this model
107:27 - is in front here you don't necessarily
107:29 - need it just yet because we're not
107:30 - modeling
107:31 - um we're not kind of like getting the
107:34 - details of his side profile yet but if
107:36 - you want to
107:37 - move this right in front we'll
107:40 - go over here and we'll hit g and then
107:42 - we'll hit y
107:44 - just like move the head back
107:47 - actually i'm going to move it i'm gonna
107:49 - move it like right about here
107:51 - so that when i extrude it back i can see
107:54 - how long i want his head to be
107:56 - okay so we have all our vertices
107:58 - selected we're just gonna hit
107:59 - e and now again we're gonna want to
108:02 - extrude to the right
108:03 - so if we're in this left panel to go
108:05 - right if we look up a little compass
108:07 - here
108:07 - we're going to use the y axis okay so
108:10 - we're going to hit e to extrude
108:12 - then hit y and then we're just going to
108:15 - bring that bad boy all the way back
108:18 - to maybe right about here because his
108:19 - head is a little long
108:21 - and then we'll just hit left click just
108:24 - to set it
108:25 - okay so if we turn as you can see we
108:28 - have his long
108:29 - mushroom looking head right now which is
108:32 - great
108:33 - and again the key to making things more
108:36 - realistic
108:37 - is to add more vertices just a standard
108:39 - practice
108:40 - i like to loop cut a couple of times on
108:43 - the body i just did one
108:45 - just so i could show you but with this
108:46 - head i think i'm going to loop cut it
108:49 - a couple of times so i'm going to
108:52 - come back into the front view here i'm
108:55 - going to go over to our panel here
108:56 - go back to loop cut now when you think
109:00 - about your
109:01 - face you know it's like this rounded
109:04 - thing
109:04 - right so there's like a cut like if i
109:07 - cut right down here that will get like
109:09 - the mirroring
109:09 - for both my eyes but i also want to
109:11 - capture like you know this rounded part
109:13 - here and this rounded part here and
109:15 - that's kind of what i think about what
109:16 - i'm doing like a body or a head i'm
109:18 - trying to figure out how to cut it
109:19 - i'm trying to think of like how round i
109:22 - want it to be
109:23 - so because i want to capture the full
109:25 - roundness of his head
109:26 - and i'm going to loop cut it maybe three
109:28 - times we'll see
109:30 - so i'm going to hit this loop cut button
109:33 - and i'm going to click right down the
109:35 - middle
109:36 - and then i want to loop cutting i'm
109:38 - going to loop cut it again why not
109:41 - and then i'm going to loop cut it again
109:43 - over on the right side
109:45 - and i also so remember we're not just
109:47 - modeling in one view
109:49 - right we want to make sure that it's
109:51 - looking good on every angle so i'm also
109:54 - just so we can see it solid i'm gonna
109:55 - bring it back to solid mode i'm gonna
109:57 - loop cut it
109:58 - at least once here i'm probably gonna
110:01 - end up cutting it more
110:02 - but just for now i'm just gonna loop cut
110:04 - it here
110:05 - and i'm just gonna go back to my mouse
110:07 - now you have the option again of doing
110:09 - the mirror modifier
110:10 - if you want to make sure that your head
110:13 - is like completely symmetrical on both
110:15 - sides
110:15 - if you want to do the mirror modifier
110:17 - again all you have to do is hit
110:19 - z to go to wireframe you're just going
110:22 - to pick whichever size
110:23 - that you want to get rid of so if you
110:25 - want to get rid of the left side
110:27 - you'll grab all the vertices on the left
110:30 - just make sure you don't grab that
110:31 - middle
110:32 - kind of partition and then you'll just
110:34 - delete it
110:35 - by pressing x and then vertices
110:39 - and then to add in the mirror we're
110:41 - going to grab everything on the right
110:44 - and then we're going to go to our panel
110:46 - here we'll go back to this wrench
110:47 - looking thing which is the
110:49 - modifier tab we'll go to add modifier
110:52 - and then we'll hit mirror and now it's
110:55 - on
110:56 - both sides and now again you might have
110:58 - some splitting going on
111:00 - uh don't worry about it if you don't
111:02 - like the splitting or if it's making you
111:04 - nervous
111:05 - you also have the option of just not
111:06 - using the mirror modifier which is
111:08 - totally fine and
111:09 - i guess i can i'll show that here
111:12 - with the head just so we can get an idea
111:15 - of like what it's like
111:16 - to not use the mirror modifier i mean
111:18 - it's really just
111:19 - more kind of manually manipulation so
111:23 - okay so from here we have our head
111:26 - again it's looking very boxy so i'm
111:28 - gonna actually come to
111:30 - our right panel now so i can start to
111:34 - move things to match the shape of mu's
111:37 - head
111:38 - so on our left side i'm going to hit z
111:41 - and hit
111:41 - wireframe so i can see where all the
111:44 - points are
111:46 - okay and again i just want to start to
111:48 - kind of match things
111:50 - really to the shape of his head okay so
111:52 - i'm going to start
111:53 - by dragging and selecting and again you
111:56 - want to make sure you're in wireframe
111:58 - because if you're in solid and you grab
112:00 - something it's only going to grab the
112:01 - very
112:02 - front one so whatever is happening on
112:03 - one side is not going to happen other
112:04 - side so make sure you're in wireframe by
112:06 - hitting z
112:07 - and then wireframe and then we're just
112:09 - going to start to drag some things
112:10 - well we're just going to figure it out
112:12 - all right so we're going to drag this
112:14 - i'm going to drag and drop and then hit
112:16 - g
112:18 - to just kind of move i'm going to take
112:21 - things a little bit slow because there
112:22 - are multiple vertices and it's really
112:24 - easy to like
112:25 - kind of tangle vertices and i don't want
112:27 - to do that
112:29 - so i'm just gonna start by
112:32 - getting these to kind of go where i'm
112:36 - thinking i want them to go and i mind
112:39 - you this might look a little bit
112:40 - different to what you're seeing if you
112:41 - decided to keep the modem
112:43 - the mirror modifier but it's the same
112:45 - kind of concept you're just kind of
112:46 - lining up
112:48 - where you think all of the
112:52 - kind of vertices should go for this side
112:54 - of the head
112:56 - i'm just going to grab it drop it
113:00 - grab this move it up a little
113:03 - i think i want to i'm actually gonna
113:06 - shift
113:08 - all these forward just a little bit and
113:12 - then i'm thinking
113:14 - move this one up and again you don't
113:16 - have to do this the exact way that i'm
113:18 - doing it
113:19 - if you're looking and you're like
113:20 - chrissy this varsity should obviously go
113:22 - over here
113:22 - please definitely do that you want to do
113:25 - it in a way that feels comfortable and
113:26 - feels like
113:28 - whatever makes sense kind of to you so
113:31 - i'm going to put this one
113:32 - here i'm going to quickly move these
113:36 - up so that i don't tangle this one
113:37 - because i want this one
113:40 - to kind of come over here but it's still
113:42 - a little low
113:44 - so i'm going to move all of these up
113:46 - again
113:48 - i'm just going to bring this one in here
113:52 - i'm going to bring this one kind of up
113:53 - here
113:55 - i'm gonna take these and bring them in
114:00 - close it to the head and then let's see
114:03 - let's take this one down now remember
114:07 - we don't have ears yet and the ears are
114:09 - kind of blocking part of the head
114:11 - so you just want to kind of assume where
114:13 - his like
114:14 - headlines i guess would fall so i'm
114:17 - going to take
114:19 - this one and put it here i'm gonna take
114:22 - this one
114:23 - just kind of put it whoops i didn't mean
114:25 - to grab all those
114:26 - i just want to grab this one kind of
114:29 - place it here
114:32 - i'm gonna bring this one just a little
114:34 - bit back
114:36 - i'm gonna bring this one here
114:41 - i'm gonna bring this one
114:44 - maybe like right about there
114:48 - we can make some adjustments
114:52 - and now again as you can see like
114:54 - there's like gaps
114:56 - that the vertices can't quite cover
114:58 - because we don't yet have enough
115:00 - but that is also something that we can
115:02 - kind of fix later on
115:04 - okay so we just moved things around you
115:06 - may have seen things kind of happen in
115:08 - the front view but i'm going to change
115:09 - this to solid just so you can see it so
115:11 - it's looking pretty good it looks like
115:13 - his head i'm going to view but as you
115:15 - can see it's pretty wide
115:17 - so we're gonna have to fix that but
115:18 - that's okay but we're starting to kind
115:20 - of capture
115:22 - what his head like the shape of the head
115:25 - from both the front
115:27 - so if we take this back to solid you see
115:29 - it's still capturing
115:31 - what it looks like in the front and if
115:32 - we change this one to wireframe as well
115:34 - it's all kind of captured on the side as
115:36 - well of course we're having some
115:38 - proportion issues but that's okay
115:41 - because right now we're just trying to
115:42 - get
115:42 - shape all right now from here
115:47 - i want to have it to where we have
115:50 - something that at least
115:52 - looks decent before we go so
115:56 - let's let's do like a little bit of
115:59 - detail work on the head
116:01 - again i usually don't try to do too too
116:04 - much
116:04 - because in order to connect the head
116:08 - and the body you kind of want the
116:13 - you don't want the mesh to be too
116:16 - unbalanced when it comes to vertices so
116:18 - if i have like a hundred vertices on the
116:21 - head
116:21 - but then i only have like 20 vertices on
116:23 - the body
116:24 - connecting it might get like a little
116:26 - bit funky
116:27 - but for the sake of just like getting us
116:30 - familiar with
116:31 - modeling and like kind of making pushing
116:33 - things around
116:35 - to make it look like what we're trying
116:36 - to model i'm gonna go ahead and do just
116:38 - a little bit of detail work
116:39 - to get this head looking a little bit
116:41 - better
116:43 - okay so from here this is definitely an
116:46 - area where i encourage you to
116:49 - go off the rails move things
116:52 - as you feel they should be moved i'm
116:54 - gonna make adjustments
116:55 - and i'll try to talk through what i'm
116:57 - doing but honestly
116:59 - it's going to look a little bit sporadic
117:00 - because that's kind of the way that i
117:02 - model
117:02 - i just kind of like try things and then
117:05 - see how it looks
117:06 - delete it if it doesn't look so good try
117:08 - other things but this is definitely
117:10 - the area where you just kind of want to
117:11 - freeform and like experiment and see
117:14 - what's working and kind of not working
117:16 - okay so for me
117:17 - as i'm looking at this head it's just
117:20 - looking like
117:22 - it just looks very alien it's looking
117:24 - kind of wide
117:26 - it's not really like as round as i would
117:29 - want it to be
117:31 - so what i'm thinking is
117:34 - now mind you i don't have the mirror
117:35 - modifier on so i have to keep in mind
117:37 - that whatever
117:38 - i do on one side i'm gonna have to do on
117:40 - the left side
117:41 - if you decide to keep the mirror
117:42 - modifier you're a little bit in luck
117:44 - because as you adjust one side it's just
117:45 - gonna automatically do that for you
117:48 - so let's see again i'm looking at this
117:50 - head
117:52 - it's looking a little funky and it's
117:55 - looking a little flat
117:57 - so i think first i'm going to try to
117:59 - kind of round out the front
118:01 - now something i haven't shown just yet
118:04 - is that so far we've been manipulating
118:06 - vertices and i think i talked about this
118:08 - just for a second but if you want to
118:11 - manipulate
118:12 - whole faces or edges you have the option
118:14 - to do that as well so
118:16 - if you come up here and you look right
118:18 - next to our edit tab
118:20 - we have these three different boxes here
118:23 - and this tells us which
118:24 - kind of editing mode or selecting mode
118:26 - that we are in
118:28 - so so far we've been in vertex select so
118:30 - if you have this selected you're going
118:31 - to see all the vertex present
118:34 - but if we want to manipulate some edges
118:36 - we can hit edge select
118:38 - and that's going to show us all the
118:39 - edges and let's say we want to
118:41 - manipulate a whole face then we'll click
118:43 - face select
118:44 - and it's also going to then allow us to
118:47 - click faces
118:48 - okay so edges will let us just click the
118:50 - edge
118:52 - and then vertices is going to show you
118:54 - to click those vertices
118:56 - now the benefit of vertex select is that
118:59 - it's going to be the most detailed
119:01 - so if you're trying to get in and like
119:02 - make really small kind of adjustments i
119:05 - would suggest sticking to vertex
119:07 - if you want to make kind of like wide
119:09 - things so usually when i'm trying to
119:10 - like round
119:11 - things out i oftentimes like to come
119:13 - into face select
119:15 - and i'll just kind of grab like some
119:17 - middle things
119:20 - and again if you want to grab more than
119:21 - one thing just hold down shift
119:24 - and like usually when we're rounding
119:26 - things out like the
119:28 - kind of front of the sphere is a little
119:31 - bit further
119:32 - than the rest so i'm just gonna grab
119:35 - this i'm gonna hit y and i'm just gonna
119:39 - bring it forward a little bit just kind
119:41 - of round
119:42 - round that part out okay so we're
119:45 - getting a little bit of roundness here
119:48 - now these um
119:52 - these sides here are giving like they're
119:55 - getting a square
119:56 - they're serving a square right now but
119:57 - we want round
119:59 - again so i'm also just going to like
120:01 - kind of grab these
120:02 - now another trick to grab things kind of
120:05 - more quickly if you know that you want
120:07 - to grab like this whole line you can
120:08 - just hold shift
120:09 - and double click and it's just going to
120:11 - grab everything
120:13 - kind of in that loop and then
120:16 - i'm going to hit grab
120:20 - and now i did something funky
120:24 - with the way that i laid so as you can
120:26 - see
120:28 - it's kind of like pushed in and out and
120:30 - this is something that i will have to
120:31 - fix
120:32 - later if you're getting some of those
120:34 - like funkiness
120:35 - where your mesh is kind of like
120:37 - overlapping
120:38 - the way that you'll want to fix that is
120:41 - just going to hit b
120:42 - in wireframe and now i know this looks a
120:44 - little bit scary
120:45 - but it's just going to show you you just
120:47 - want to like look
120:49 - and just kind of see what is what are
120:51 - the ones that are kind of like inverted
120:53 - so if i get close here if you can see
120:56 - right here oh
120:59 - this point
121:03 - sorry i'm trying to get close in there
121:04 - it's actually not
121:07 - it's this point i'm just kind of looking
121:09 - to see
121:11 - what part is kind of inside of each
121:13 - other also going to like
121:16 - i just switched to edge mode so i can
121:19 - see what the lines are
121:22 - let's see i think
121:25 - this line which i'm having some trouble
121:28 - grabbing
121:30 - is just like a little bit it's kind of
121:33 - going over
121:34 - this other line here so i'm just going
121:35 - to quickly just kind of bring it out
121:40 - so i don't want it to be in the way
121:44 - i'm going to see how that feels and
121:45 - again this is the part where i'm saying
121:47 - it gets really funky and like
121:49 - if you're like chrissy you should do
121:50 - something else like try
121:53 - whatever works for you here because you
121:56 - want to try to get
121:58 - these vertices to not be on top of each
122:00 - other like this
122:02 - like i'm having this like concave like
122:04 - funky thing going on here
122:05 - that is like not what i want at all
122:09 - i'm gonna go back into wireframe just to
122:10 - see
122:13 - what is overlapping
122:16 - i think this one
122:20 - i'm just gonna bring this a little bit
122:22 - in and bring this one
122:25 - a little bit out just see if i can try
122:29 - to like correct
122:32 - some of these things dan how are you
122:35 - doing over there
122:36 - how's yours looking
122:39 - mine's mine's looking kind of
122:41 - interesting
122:44 - i i'm going to bring it up on the screen
122:46 - so people can see really briefly it's
122:47 - not as it's not as beautiful as yours
122:49 - this is i mean looking very very funky
122:52 - right now
122:53 - oops one thing actually that's happened
122:55 - to me um
122:56 - and i i'm going to show this i i
122:58 - actually there is a way that i can
123:00 - have you see what i'm doing by like
123:02 - sending it but
123:03 - back into the zoom meeting but but let
123:04 - me just explain it
123:06 - so when i'm i'm in my um
123:10 - front orthographic view and as soon as i
123:13 - go to
123:14 - rotate it like takes me somewhere like
123:16 - really not rotate as soon as i go to
123:18 - like
123:19 - a spin so that i can look at it from a
123:21 - slightly different angle
123:22 - it takes me to like this weird other
123:24 - place like
123:26 - far far away from the model oh no
123:29 - oh okay i'm showing it to people so
123:32 - maybe
123:32 - maybe somebody if somebody you don't
123:34 - need to answer this for me right now
123:35 - figured out but i'm just showing it if
123:36 - somebody in
123:37 - who's watching the live knows i'm sort
123:39 - of demonstrating it because it doesn't
123:40 - happen for me on my left panel
123:42 - like that works as expected like like
123:45 - where it thinks the center of the world
123:46 - is or something when i start to spit
123:49 - i'm wondering there could be a couple
123:52 - different things going on i think i'd
123:53 - have to see it yeah
123:56 - i can work that out with you later but i
123:58 - think you know i think we're in like a
124:00 - pretty good place like i mean you could
124:01 - probably um i'm i'm moving it back to
124:04 - your screen now work on like the
124:06 - detailing here
124:07 - like forever yeah i mean this is
124:11 - this is the hard part to i guess kind of
124:14 - show because this
124:15 - takes forever like because vertices get
124:17 - lost
124:18 - vertices do things that you did not want
124:20 - it to do and it really takes a lot of
124:22 - just like manipulating
124:24 - for a while so i think i would love i
124:27 - would love to show and walk us through
124:28 - getting through them all because i know
124:30 - probably right now
124:31 - like this looks like nothing i don't
124:32 - know but i do want to
124:34 - show you kind of how to export
124:37 - yeah and also um
124:40 - i can just yeah i said oh
124:43 - maybe i can show maybe i can do
124:45 - something after
124:46 - to walk us through like after like a
124:49 - different live stream or like a video or
124:51 - something i can
124:52 - show kind of better how to detail
124:54 - because trying to do it quickly
124:56 - is kind of what got me into this anyway
124:58 - yeah well i think
124:59 - you know detailing to me also feels like
125:01 - that's like a huge
125:02 - like subject unto itself yeah this is
125:05 - like incredible
125:06 - i mean i was i mean i've never made a
125:08 - model like this before and i was totally
125:10 - able to do it which is kind of
125:11 - unbelievable oh people are answering my
125:13 - question now
125:16 - um so but i do think that's what's
125:18 - really important for us to show
125:20 - is i mean obviously i see in mine like
125:22 - there's like file save
125:24 - yeah so i will show kind of the
125:27 - difference between saving
125:28 - and exporting and also really quickly i
125:31 - think i saved
125:34 - my mew before i connected things
125:37 - so let me see if i can let's see what
125:40 - this looks like
125:43 - oh yeah i'd love to see the um
125:46 - the finished view yeah i think i moved
125:49 - it to a different file
125:53 - sorry you're like seeing my whole
125:56 - desktop right now okay i can switch to
125:58 - mine
125:58 - i'm switch to mine for a second while
126:00 - you're looking so people said i should
126:02 - hit
126:03 - preferences navigation orbit around
126:05 - selection
126:11 - tell me when you're ready i'll switch it
126:12 - back to yours okay
126:15 - let's go maybe your anchor point is not
126:19 - center click shift s cursor to world
126:22 - origin
126:24 - cursor to world origin
126:30 - no
126:38 - oh okay let's see let's try one more
126:41 - right marcos writes and this is exactly
126:44 - how i feel
126:45 - for beginners like myself making two
126:47 - boxes with rounded corners is a victory
126:49 - i totally agree like i got this sort of
126:52 - like lumpy frumpy little like beginnings
126:54 - of a mew
126:55 - and uh bar and i'm just like so excited
126:58 - to
127:00 - see where it goes yay i'm glad i wanted
127:03 - to be able to walk everyone through
127:05 - but it is kind of like a lot
127:08 - for the time that we have but i'll do my
127:10 - best yeah
127:11 - and also you know one thing that that i
127:13 - don't know if anyone asked this but
127:14 - um certainly i'm curious is like where
127:18 - like what are what are you know
127:20 - resources that other people that you
127:22 - found useful as your
127:24 - learning blender like if people want to
127:26 - learn more do more is there
127:28 - uh a book that you looked at a website i
127:31 - mean there's
127:32 - um are there recommendations yeah so
127:35 - first i mean youtube is definitely my
127:37 - best friend
127:38 - um a couple one modeler i can think of
127:42 - off the brain i think his name is olaf
127:45 - 3d
127:47 - hat i think has some good tutorials for
127:50 - modeling but also if you're really
127:51 - interested in animation
127:53 - um i can't think of any more off the
127:56 - head i can
127:57 - try to gather some things after just
127:59 - look through
128:00 - but there if you just um like
128:03 - youtube like uh 3d model humans
128:07 - or yeah 3d model or character modeling
128:11 - or modeling for 3d printing you'll get
128:12 - some really good things also on the
128:14 - blender website
128:15 - they have some references built in as
128:17 - well they have a whole library
128:18 - that you can go through that has some
128:19 - really great like tutorials and tips
128:22 - and um one other thing is like i you
128:24 - know uh
128:25 - coding train regular viewers probably
128:27 - know about this but if you're new here
128:29 - because you came because you want to
128:30 - learn about blender you want to learn
128:31 - more about chrissy's work
128:32 - um we do have a discord so i think if i
128:35 - press this button here
128:36 - the link to the discord is going to go
128:37 - into the chat just did
128:39 - um and so that could also be a place we
128:41 - could create a blender channel in there
128:43 - um you know people could sort of like
128:45 - share resources or ask questions
128:46 - or even if like you know we could share
128:49 - some like model files and different
128:51 - things there as well i mean chrissy
128:52 - you're welcome to try to
128:53 - obligate you to suddenly joining our
128:54 - discord answering everybody's question
128:57 - but if you want to pop in there and like
128:58 - that's also a place where people who
129:00 - want to go further with us could reach
129:01 - out to you
129:02 - for sure um we could
129:06 - we can switch back okay look at that
129:10 - it looks a little funky uh the reason
129:12 - why these are um
129:14 - pink right now is because these are
129:15 - actually the reference photo but i move
129:17 - them
129:18 - off my desktop originally they were on
129:19 - my desktop and then i moved it off my
129:20 - desktop
129:21 - and then i moved it back so the file
129:23 - path just kind of got messed up so i'm
129:24 - just going to hide those
129:25 - we don't have to worry about that okay
129:27 - so this was like
129:29 - kind of a beginning stage for the mew um
129:32 - right now it has the mirror modifier on
129:35 - it
129:35 - on both of these and but it's all um
129:39 - none of these are connected right now so
129:41 - i can just really quickly
129:42 - show you what i would do to first
129:46 - apply the mirror modifier and then kind
129:48 - of sew
129:49 - the head back together in the body and
129:52 - then like connect
129:54 - i i think i'll sure okay hopefully i can
129:57 - do that quick so then i can
129:58 - go all the rendering stuff okay so again
130:01 - right now everything
130:02 - is separate um let's start with maybe
130:06 - sewing the head back together so i'm
130:08 - gonna hide
130:10 - body i'm gonna hide the split on the
130:12 - head
130:14 - all this good stuff okay so we have our
130:15 - head now
130:17 - in order to apply a modifier you have to
130:19 - be in object mode which is what we are
130:21 - in right now
130:22 - and then once you apply it it's
130:24 - basically it just doesn't
130:26 - it's not going to mirror anymore so we
130:28 - are at that point like we have our head
130:30 - it's looking decent we're just going to
130:32 - hit apply
130:34 - so now all of these vertices are their
130:36 - own again so if i do something on the
130:37 - right it's not going to affect the left
130:39 - anymore
130:40 - so to sew this up honestly i'm pretty
130:43 - sure there's a quicker way to do this
130:45 - and like i feel like i've done in the
130:46 - past but i can't remember that way so
130:48 - i'm going to show you the way that i do
130:50 - remember
130:51 - the way that i merge kind of uh vertices
130:54 - together
130:54 - is i'll just click one and i'll click
130:57 - its buddy
130:58 - and i'll hit option m and then at center
131:03 - and i'll just go and be a surgeon
131:07 - and stitch mew right on up
131:11 - so this is what you can do to
131:14 - if that mirror modifier left you with a
131:16 - split you can just sew him
131:19 - right back up by doing this and as i'm
131:22 - doing this i'm realizing that if i'm
131:23 - going to do this for the head and the
131:25 - body we're
131:26 - probably going to take a little minute
131:28 - but i do want to show
131:31 - what it is like to connect so i'm just
131:34 - going to sew these bottom ones really
131:35 - quick
131:37 - and then i'll try to
131:43 - don't want that there's some interesting
131:45 - suggestions in the chat
131:47 - that people are saying also the way that
131:49 - they do this like
131:50 - solar liner writes you don't need to uh
131:54 - there's a merge mode in the mirror
131:56 - modifier that merges vertices and edges
131:58 - that are close to the mirror plane
132:00 - oh sleep and luis says
132:03 - select clipping in the mirror and select
132:06 - the middle vertices move them to center
132:08 - i don't know what that means but it
132:09 - sounds very it sounds like the right
132:11 - idea
132:12 - i already applied this modifier so i
132:14 - have to go back but those sound like
132:16 - really great
132:16 - yeah they sound like really great and
132:18 - simple selections it's the same thing as
132:20 - with coding there's always like in
132:21 - javascript especially there's like 10
132:22 - ways to do the same exact thing so and
132:24 - everybody has their own
132:26 - sort of like tricks and style thank you
132:29 - for putting those suggestions in there
132:31 - because i will that will save me a lot
132:32 - of time
132:34 - um again i did want to show
132:37 - how to do that but i want to make sure
132:39 - that i get in how to render
132:41 - and all that good stuff so i'm going to
132:44 - skip to that i'm so sorry
132:47 - yeah i think that's great okay there's
132:49 - no way that this well first of all
132:50 - there's no way that this single live
132:52 - stream
132:52 - could comprehensively cover everything
132:54 - there is
132:56 - so i think i just want to show
132:58 - everything i want everyone to be able to
132:59 - have their mind
133:00 - but what we what i think what's really
133:02 - amazing that you're doing is just like
133:04 - i wouldn't have even known where to even
133:06 - start i can't believe that i've already
133:08 - made
133:09 - a model and so like obviously there's
133:11 - you know it's
133:12 - what's the like a mile wide an inch deep
133:14 - but i've got that
133:16 - wrong whatever the expression is you
133:18 - know we've got that basic and there's
133:19 - obviously you can go
133:20 - super deep into blender and and a couple
133:23 - people also posted some of their
133:25 - uh youtube channels that they um that
133:27 - they suggest for so one of the things
133:30 - that i can also do
133:31 - is this when this video gets archived
133:34 - the
133:34 - uh it'll be on youtube but i can always
133:36 - add an update to the video description
133:39 - so if there are additional resources or
133:40 - things that we want to add we'll just
133:42 - put that in the video description
133:43 - perfect
133:45 - okay so if you saw like the
133:48 - kind of screenshot or the image of like
133:51 - the final mew that was on
133:53 - like the coding train page or on my page
133:55 - this is what
133:56 - the model was so this is my finished one
133:58 - um again i usually do low poly work i
134:00 - usually keep things actually
134:02 - lower poly than this but i wanted the mu
134:05 - to be a little bit smooth
134:07 - so there was a couple things i did to do
134:09 - that but here is
134:10 - my little mew um i added if you're
134:13 - seeing these boxes
134:14 - um i just added some plain so i can
134:16 - create like a stage
134:18 - to uh take a picture
134:21 - in that's a whole other doing background
134:24 - stuff is like a whole other thing in
134:25 - blender that i can't really get into
134:26 - right now but if you're wondering like
134:28 - why are these huge planes there
134:30 - that's that's just why you don't need to
134:31 - add planes right now okay so
134:34 - let's say you know you you got it you
134:36 - work through all of the manipulating of
134:38 - the vertices
134:39 - your mu is looking good you want to save
134:42 - it
134:42 - that's first and foremost we want to
134:43 - make sure we save so to save you're just
134:45 - going to come up here
134:46 - to file you just go to save as
134:50 - and then you can
134:54 - save the file whatever you want to save
134:56 - it as i saved it as new final i usually
134:58 - save
134:58 - as i move through every process
135:02 - so like when i finished which i guess i
135:04 - didn't do that with the
135:05 - oh what what i did like when i had all
135:07 - my finished pieces
135:08 - well first i'll save it in the very
135:09 - beginning and then as i have all my
135:12 - finished pieces i'll save that as
135:13 - something
135:14 - before i connect things just in case i
135:16 - messed something up and i'll save it
135:18 - again after connecting
135:19 - and i'll save it again once i have like
135:21 - my scene set up
135:22 - you want to make sure you save and then
135:24 - you just save it to whatever
135:26 - folder whatever box you just hit save a
135:28 - splendor file
135:30 - if you want to make this like a obg file
135:33 - i'm in obj file for putting and
135:35 - processing or any other type of file
135:38 - you'll then go to export and you'll see
135:40 - all the different types of files here
135:42 - so you have obj right here you have stl
135:45 - stl is good for 3d printing and a whole
135:49 - other range of files okay so again if
135:52 - you want to save
135:53 - saving is one thing and then exporting
135:56 - is another thing exporting is what
135:57 - you'll use to put it in
135:58 - another kind of software now rendering
136:02 - is its own third thing so like i said in
136:06 - order to
136:07 - render so to take a picture of it
136:10 - you have to have a camera okay so that's
136:12 - what this little doohickey is right here
136:14 - this is my camera that i had set up
136:16 - um i can't well
136:19 - just to make sure everyone knows how to
136:22 - add a camera since we deleted it in the
136:23 - previous one
136:24 - i'll do that with us so i'm going to
136:25 - delete this and we're just going to hit
136:28 - shift a
136:29 - make sure you're in object mode if
136:30 - you're not in object mode you just wanna
136:32 - hit tab to get back to object mode
136:34 - hit shift a and then you can come down
136:36 - here to camera
136:39 - now sometimes when you add the camera
136:41 - it's like already i'm pretty much every
136:43 - time when you add a camera into a scene
136:44 - it's like
136:45 - already kind of at this like funky angle
136:48 - it's just like why are you rotated
136:49 - slightly i don't really understand this
136:51 - if you want to clear that you can just
136:53 - hit option r
136:55 - you can hit option g to put it in the
136:57 - center if it's not in the center already
136:59 - and then as you can see it's pointing
137:01 - downward so we just want to rotate it
137:03 - so i'm going to rotate it on the
137:06 - y i'm going to do whoops
137:09 - sorry i'm going to rotate it
137:12 - on the x 90 degrees so that it's gonna
137:16 - be like facing
137:18 - our precious mu okay and then
137:21 - you move things the same way that you
137:22 - move a mesh you can move the camera
137:24 - so you just hit g to grab and you hit y
137:29 - and we can move this in front okay now
137:32 - our camera has its own separate view
137:36 - from what we are seeing in the viewport
137:38 - so viewport view
137:39 - and camera view are different so if you
137:42 - want to know what your camera is seeing
137:44 - there's two ways you can do this one is
137:47 - you can just come to view
137:49 - and um you can go sorry if we go to view
137:53 - you go to viewport if you hit camera or
137:55 - if you hit zero
137:57 - you'll see what your camera is seeing
138:00 - now once you rotate though it's going to
138:03 - instantly take you out of that
138:05 - so if you want your camera to kind of
138:07 - move with you there's a way you can lock
138:09 - that
138:10 - so to do that we're gonna first hit n
138:13 - it's gonna bring up this panel right
138:15 - here
138:16 - okay and we're gonna make sure we're in
138:17 - this view tab
138:19 - and we're gonna hit lock camera to view
138:24 - okay so then we're gonna hit zero again
138:25 - to go back to the camera mode what
138:26 - button did you press to bring up that
138:29 - tab to lock you'll hit n so
138:32 - as in number yeah and then you'll go to
138:35 - the view
138:36 - tab and then you hit lock camera to view
138:39 - and then now when we rotate
138:42 - or as we move the camera moves
138:46 - with us so this is really good for
138:48 - making sure that like when you're ready
138:49 - to take your picture
138:51 - but it's at the exact kind of angle that
138:54 - you wanted and so if i want this like
138:55 - bird's eye view like mew or maybe i want
138:58 - this like side view because i think he
139:00 - looks adorable for the side
139:01 - i can go ahead and just set that right
139:03 - on up and whatever is
139:05 - within the um orange
139:08 - or yellow kind of outline is what you're
139:10 - going to get in your camera
139:11 - there's different ways that you can
139:13 - adjust your camera which again we don't
139:15 - have time to get in here but there's a
139:16 - whole camera panel
139:18 - over here on the right where you can
139:19 - adjust um
139:22 - your camera we can adjust the dimensions
139:24 - and all that good stuff we're not going
139:25 - to worry about that right now
139:27 - so in order to render then so we have
139:30 - our camera set up
139:31 - at the angle that we want um
139:34 - i do want to know that if we don't have
139:36 - light in there
139:38 - your picture is not going to show so you
139:40 - want to make sure to add
139:42 - a light i already have a light set up
139:44 - because again this is my like final
139:46 - scene type of thing so you'll be able to
139:48 - see what happens here
139:49 - but just know that if you go to render
139:51 - if you do the same exact steps that i
139:53 - do here and it's just like completely
139:54 - dark it's because you don't have a light
139:56 - and if you want to add light you can add
139:58 - do shift a
139:59 - again and there's a bunch of different
140:01 - types of lights here
140:02 - you can just kind of arbitrarily throw
140:04 - one in for now just so you can have some
140:06 - light around me for when you take your
140:08 - picture
140:09 - okay so to render there's a couple
140:12 - different ways that you can
140:14 - go about rendering as well i mean the
140:15 - simplest way is you can come up here to
140:18 - the render tab
140:19 - and you can just hit render image
140:23 - and now my computer is a little bit slow
140:25 - because it is old
140:26 - but i will show you i got mine
140:31 - i'm gonna switch i'm gonna show it to
140:32 - people wait everybody here's my view
140:38 - and mine just popped up it's pretty here
140:41 - we go
140:42 - back to yours yours is much nicer
140:46 - back and forth everybody really simple
140:49 - again just wall and floor and color just
140:51 - so he can like be
140:52 - in something nothing fancy but that's
140:54 - why you're seeing like
140:55 - the little teal colors because i put a
140:57 - color onto the wall
140:58 - now so you have your picture this is
141:00 - what it looks rendered
141:02 - what you'll do to save it is it'll just
141:04 - go up here to image
141:06 - and then save as and then
141:11 - i'll just name it i'm just gonna put on
141:14 - my desktop and save it
141:17 - and then when i go to my desktop
141:22 - we have the image right here and this is
141:24 - what you can use to
141:26 - share you can always just take a
141:28 - screenshot but the screenshot is not
141:29 - going to be
141:30 - as good as a resolution the benefit of
141:32 - rendering is that you're able to up the
141:33 - resolution
141:34 - um i could make it like better than this
141:37 - if i wanted to i can change the
141:38 - dimensions of it
141:40 - um when i want to animate that's how
141:42 - you'll capture it through rendering
141:44 - so yeah when you're ready to export your
141:47 - picture that's all you have to do you
141:48 - just want to make sure you have a camera
141:49 - and you have a light in there
141:51 - and you just set your scene up however
141:53 - you want so
141:55 - if um this is amazing by the way i'm so
141:58 - excited we just i don't know why
141:59 - that step to me was just so exciting to
142:01 - see the sort of like
142:02 - high quality render um which especially
142:06 - when working in like real time
142:07 - graphics with 3d and processing or p5
142:10 - generally you don't have that sort of
142:11 - like
142:12 - level of resolution um so i i guess as
142:16 - an ex
142:16 - i guess one thing so let's think about
142:18 - this for a second if people make their
142:19 - own
142:20 - models that they learn to make from
142:22 - today and they want to share it with you
142:23 - or me or both of us
142:25 - um so that um obviously we have
142:27 - rendering the image is perfect um do you
142:29 - would you
142:30 - like is instagram or twitter like what's
142:32 - um what's a good and should we should we
142:34 - come up with a um
142:36 - a plan a hashtag um oh
142:39 - hashtags are cute let's see so i'm gonna
142:42 - pull up
142:43 - um well i'm not logged into my twitter
142:47 - right now it's gonna post mine but
142:49 - if you do want to post it um either to
142:52 - twitter or to instagram and to share it
142:54 - for me to see i'm chrissy bermidge on
142:56 - both okay
142:58 - so i would love to see it please feel
142:59 - free to tag me i would love to see your
143:01 - mew and also if you have any questions

143:09 - screen now i'm pulling up your twitter
143:10 - which has um when you by the way if you
143:13 - want to see the reel again it's right
143:14 - there i posted the reel on my twitter
143:15 - which chrissy has here at the top of
143:17 - hers as well
143:21 - um let's pull up your instagram also
143:27 - so people can see it alright and there's
143:28 - mew there's exactly that image yay
143:32 - perfect so yeah please feel free to
143:36 - share please feel free to experiment
143:37 - feel free to ask questions i'll make
143:39 - sure to
143:41 - what one one thing that came up in the
143:44 - chat like so
143:45 - um so we can we can answer maybe um we
143:47 - we
143:48 - we should probably wrap up like let
143:50 - chrissy and everybody have a break
143:52 - because we've been going for a very long
143:53 - time thank you so much for spending so
143:55 - much time with us
143:57 - it's like incredible the amount of um
144:00 - uh information that you were able to
144:02 - pack into such a like one singular live
144:04 - stream
144:05 - i know if i if i had my whole weekend
144:07 - free i'd just be uh which you know
144:09 - would be stuck in like in blender i
144:11 - think yeah
144:12 - definitely have to find some more time
144:14 - um somebody a couple people mentioned in
144:15 - the chat
144:16 - um you that that you can shade it with
144:19 - smooth on
144:20 - or smooth shade yes so you can what is
144:23 - that
144:24 - so let me get out of this rendering here
144:27 - then go back
144:28 - and blender so i usually
144:33 - don't use smooth shading because i
144:36 - do low poly but if you want to
144:40 - you can just and let me um let me add in
144:43 - like a different
144:46 - like model because this is already
144:47 - pretty smooth or let me just go back to
144:49 - one of the other ones that i had open
144:53 - it's gonna be like oh
144:58 - oops i forgot that i moved it
145:03 - okay so like this one for example uh
145:06 - let's say that i wanted to just make
145:08 - like i wanted to render where it's not
145:10 - so boxy or i want it to
145:12 - the shading to be smoother just
145:15 - automatically
145:16 - what you can do is just right click
145:18 - whoops first
145:19 - sorry we're going to tab into edit
145:22 - i'm just going to right click that
145:25 - amaryllis writes um this stream was the
145:28 - best as i have a good confidence of
145:30 - making low
145:31 - poly the stream gave me next level
145:33 - confidence
145:34 - um and and the people in the chat are
145:37 - are suggesting i think i suggested it if
145:39 - people are thumbs upping it
145:40 - our hashtag is mewtrain so
145:43 - m-e-w-t-r-a-i-n
145:45 - i love that i love that so yeah okay so
145:48 - with
145:49 - that question you have the choice of um
145:51 - having with
145:52 - it being flat or have it being smooth so
145:54 - i've been doing flat because again i do
145:56 - low poly stuff but if you want it to be
145:58 - smooth just right click
146:00 - whoops make sure you're on the object
146:02 - and then right click and then hit just
146:03 - shade smooth you see it on oh yeah wow
146:07 - yeah the way that i made the mute though
146:10 - um smooth in that final
146:13 - reference was actually a modifier so i
146:15 - can show that as well let me
146:17 - move my zoom screen again it's in front
146:19 - so i'm just going to take this head here
146:21 - i'm going to go to the modifier tab and
146:24 - i'm just going to apply
146:25 - that because i don't really need it
146:26 - anymore and then the way that i did that
146:29 - was i went to da da da da da where is it
146:34 - subdivision surface it automatically
146:37 - just kind of smooths things out for you
146:38 - ah okay and then you just hit apply
146:43 - so in your um the final mu version that
146:46 - you made that's the stuff that you that
146:48 - you added
146:48 - yeah because i like like i said i love
146:51 - low poly and i wanted
146:53 - those kind of like planes in there so i
146:55 - usually do the subdivision surface but
146:57 - if you just want it to be completely
146:58 - round
146:59 - you can go ahead and just switch right
147:01 - over to
147:02 - shane's food um so funny story is that
147:06 - when i first was experimenting with some
147:08 - new 3d printers that we got at nyu
147:10 - my kids asked me to 3d print a pikachu
147:13 - and so i found some model that i online
147:16 - and i just like downloaded it and 3d
147:18 - printed was great
147:19 - is there are is there like anything you
147:22 - have to keep in mind like could that mew
147:24 - that you made be 3d printed
147:26 - or do you have to like conform to some
147:29 - specification like you can't have the
147:31 - model do this twist or this turn
147:33 - i mean it probably depends on what 3d
147:34 - printer you're using i'm sure i'm uh
147:36 - opening up a huge can of worms here but
147:38 - in in the basic sense
147:41 - if people want to 3d print what they've
147:43 - made is there anything any extra steps
147:45 - they should think about
147:46 - yeah so
147:50 - i'm still honestly trying to figure this
147:52 - out myself because i i started modeling
147:54 - in 2018 but then that first model that i
147:57 - made it was to be printed but i had
147:59 - someone else printed
148:00 - i just bought my first printer last year
148:03 - and what i am learning is that there
148:05 - definitely are things that you have to
148:06 - keep in mind
148:07 - um just off the brain some things i'm
148:09 - thinking about are like
148:10 - inverted vertexes so like how i had some
148:13 - of those
148:13 - like when i was playing around with that
148:15 - initial model and i had some vertexes
148:17 - that were kind of like
148:18 - under other vertexes that can cause
148:20 - errors but honestly there are software's
148:22 - out there already that people have made
148:24 - like open source things that will
148:26 - correct your model for you
148:28 - so at this stage if you're like i want
148:30 - to print things right away but i'm not
148:31 - sure
148:32 - if my model is kind of up to par for
148:34 - that
148:35 - you can i can give you a link to one of
148:37 - them so that you can just pop your model
148:38 - in it and it'll correct things for you
148:40 - and you can go ahead and print it but
148:41 - yeah there definitely are things
148:43 - that you have to learn about on that
148:44 - front but that's like definitely a whole
148:46 - other beast
148:47 - to kind of tackle and and people in the
148:50 - chat are are agreeing with you that the
148:52 - low poly aesthetic has a beauty all of
148:54 - its own
148:54 - and um uh someone else wrote
148:57 - and oh yeah a vedang writes voxel art
149:00 - also looks cool as well which i would
149:01 - agree
149:02 - yeah i mean i think there's in many ways
149:04 - sometimes you can get so wrapped up
149:06 - into creating something that's photo
149:09 - realistic
149:10 - or so highly detailed that you can sort
149:12 - of like lose sight
149:13 - of your artistic intentions and a lot of
149:15 - ways you can express yourself
149:16 - or be more creative with through
149:18 - abstraction and through
149:20 - um like lowering of the resolution
149:23 - so and i definitely see that in your
149:25 - work i mean the
149:26 - i mentioned this to you before we came
149:28 - on the the figure pointing at the sort
149:30 - of like planetary like
149:32 - orb that's just uh filling the space
149:35 - with stars and light is just
149:37 - so um to me this is so beautiful
149:40 - and there's not there's no color there
149:42 - there's no
149:43 - there's no fine details but there's
149:45 - something about um the energy that
149:47 - emanates from that simple
149:48 - um scene that's like really impactful
149:51 - thank you
149:53 - um uh marcos writes usually 3d printer
149:56 - software converts 3d models to what a 3d
149:57 - printer can easily
149:58 - read so yeah so it sounds like that's
150:01 - also along the same lines of
150:05 - step of putting it in um
150:09 - what is it called oh gosh i cannot
150:11 - remember slicing software
150:13 - i forgot it i'm forgetting what it's
150:14 - called but i use something called cura
150:16 - where it's like once you make the model
150:17 - oh
150:18 - i've used that yeah yeah you then and
150:20 - then you can correct things
150:21 - in there as well so yeah
150:26 - awesome well i think this is a nice
150:28 - point to
150:29 - wrap up um if everybody in the chat
150:33 - could give a little love and thank you
150:34 - to chrissy for spending so much time
150:36 - with us today
150:37 - i mean i i feel like i often teach new
150:40 - things to people on the coding train
150:42 - but and so i don't usually get to
150:43 - experience the other way around it was
150:45 - like such a thrill to have like
150:47 - something that i really don't know
150:48 - anything about and to try to follow
150:49 - along and i'm i'm so excited as soon as
150:51 - i get off i'm gonna
150:53 - share my model on twitter and all of
150:56 - that
150:56 - and i hope that all of you will also
150:58 - share um if you want to learn more
151:01 - about chrissy's work again um the link
151:03 - to her website
151:04 - is i'm i'm pulling it up right now oh
151:05 - you don't see my screen i'm gonna switch
151:06 - to that
151:07 - i'm pulling it up um is uh is in the
151:09 - video subscription
151:10 - chrissyprimage.com you can go to
151:14 - um her instagram as well as twitter make
151:17 - sure
151:18 - our hashtag is mewtrain hopefully no
151:21 - i'm i'm just gonna like uh i shouldn't
151:23 - be doing i'm gonna i'm just gonna switch
151:24 - off my uh screen for a second because
151:27 - i'm just gonna
151:28 - check no results from utrain so that's
151:30 - good i always worry like i'm gonna pull
151:31 - up something on twitter and
151:33 - by accident i don't wanna pull up
151:34 - something right
151:36 - without looking at it first so you can
151:37 - see you can see that there's no results
151:39 - from utrain so we can fill the universe
151:42 - with beautiful 3d models made in blender
151:46 - and utrain and i will i'm certainly
151:47 - making a commitment
151:49 - to in a follow-up stream try to see if i
151:51 - can take my
151:52 - obj model that i exported and bring it
151:54 - into processing or p5
151:56 - which i know that will be of interest to
151:57 - people and um
151:59 - you know we can always consider us as
152:01 - sometime in a future date if chrissy
152:02 - wants to come back and show some
152:04 - additional steps of course
152:05 - you're more than welcome to do that um
152:08 - i can also make my um my final mew
152:11 - available
152:11 - like the file the obj file so if you
152:14 - guys want to go ahead and start playing
152:15 - around with it and processing i'll make
152:17 - that
152:17 - available that's a great idea yeah so
152:19 - we'll that's a great idea and i'll try
152:20 - to um
152:21 - figure out you know just look for in the
152:22 - video subscription but certainly if you
152:24 - join the discord
152:25 - if we have a webpage or github repo or
152:27 - something where we put some of these
152:28 - materials
152:29 - um i'll make sure to link to that for
152:31 - sure um
152:33 - let me also just briefly let me i'm
152:35 - gonna check um i think
152:37 - if i pull up the live stream i've saw so
152:39 - many donations come in
152:41 - i'm just gonna pull this up and it looks
152:43 - like oh i i wonder if
152:45 - we either exactly reached the goal of
152:47 - 500 or we went over it and youtube just
152:50 - doesn't list it it's
152:51 - awesome so that's wonderful thank you
152:54 - everyone
152:54 - thank you everyone i'm i'm looking for
152:56 - my train whistle which is my way of
152:59 - very strange way of saying thank you to
153:01 - people
153:02 - that's wonderful that we're able to
153:04 - support please um if you want to learn
153:06 - more about the tender foundation or if
153:07 - you want to
153:08 - you know get involved or volunteer make
153:09 - a donation you know check out their
153:11 - website it's
153:13 - thetenderfoundation.com and i believe
153:16 - also um tender foundation is on
153:19 - instagram as well so if you want to i
153:21 - don't know that it makes sense to share
153:23 - our 3d models with the tender foundation
153:24 - but why not you know
153:25 - give them some love if you make a 3d
153:28 - model
153:29 - um that you were inspired from this live
153:31 - stream um
153:32 - so that i think really wraps them i'm
153:36 - almost
153:36 - always like so awkward trying to end
153:38 - these uh they've been here for quite a
153:40 - long time
153:40 - i think i know uh two and a half hours
153:44 - you know i i've i routinely the joke one
153:47 - of the running jokes that i'm like i
153:48 - really i can only live stream for an
153:50 - hour today i have to be somewhere in an
153:51 - hour
153:52 - four hours later i'm still trying to
153:53 - debunk some pain so

154:14 - guest conductor videos
154:16 - planned probably not till august i'm
154:18 - hoping to do one more
154:20 - coding in the cabana tutorial video
154:22 - sometime in the next few weeks
154:23 - so stay tuned for that and i'm going to
154:24 - have one probably last live stream of
154:27 - the summer because i'm going to be

155:03 - using this right now to amplify black
155:05 - voices in tech
155:07 - you can write to psy at
155:08 - thecodingtrain.com that's cy
155:11 - at thecodingtrain.com okay anything else
155:13 - that i miss chrissy that you want to say
155:15 - before we go
155:16 - um i just want to say thank you to you
155:19 - and also
155:20 - corsair and also to the coding train
155:22 - community for
155:23 - first of all for sticking it out for was
155:25 - it two hours two and a half
155:26 - years thanks so much for being here
