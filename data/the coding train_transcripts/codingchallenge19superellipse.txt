00:00 - hello and welcome to another coding
00:02 - challenge this challenge is going to
00:03 - happen in three parts the goal is to
00:06 - eventually in-processing make these 3d
00:09 - super shapes
00:10 - so there's like these weird crazy
00:12 - formulas that you can find this is my
00:14 - reference that there'll be a link to it
00:16 - in in the video's description on Paul
00:19 - Bork net which goes through the math
00:22 - behind these super shapes and what they
00:25 - look like when you render them with
00:26 - different variables but I'm going to
00:28 - start way back I'm going to go way back
00:30 - into time into a much simpler place and
00:33 - rather than make a 3d so the last piece
00:36 - is 3d super sheet shape the second piece
00:39 - is 2d super shape but the first piece is
00:42 - actually just something called the super
00:44 - ellipse the super ellipse is going to be
00:47 - a simple example to show you how to
00:50 - build a shape that satisfies a
00:53 - particular formula and that particular
00:55 - formula is right here sorry on Wikipedia
00:57 - it is this particular formula right here
01:00 - so let me talk to you a little bit about
01:02 - the origins of this super ellipse
01:05 - formula okay so you might be familiar
01:08 - you might remember this shape from my
01:11 - previous video polar coordinates and
01:13 - trigonometry it is called a circle so a
01:16 - circle is a shape that has a center
01:20 - point and a radius and you can think of
01:25 - describing any point along the outside
01:28 - of that circle by that radius and some
01:31 - angle of rotation but you can also think
01:34 - of it as sorry oh wow x and a y and so
01:40 - we know through the Pythagorean theorem
01:43 - that with a right triangle a squared
01:46 - plus B squared equals C squared or x
01:48 - squared plus y squared equals R squared
01:51 - we also know through the definition of
01:54 - what sine and cosine mean sine being
01:56 - opposite over hypotenuse cosine being
01:59 - adjacent over hypotenuse we can solve
02:02 - for x and y based on R and theta so x
02:05 - equals R times cosine of theta and y
02:10 - equals R times sine of theta
02:13 - so knowing this we can actually use
02:16 - these formulas to set a whole bunch of
02:20 - vertex points and draw a circle without
02:23 - the ellipse function with begin shape
02:25 - and shape and vertex let's actually go
02:27 - do that really quickly right now in the
02:28 - code and we're going to come back so
02:30 - we're going to go do that and I'm going
02:31 - to come back to this formula and show
02:32 - you show you what happens to that
02:34 - particular lips so if I go I've got a
02:36 - blank whoops excuse me a blank code
02:38 - example right here it's running in the
02:41 - browser it's doing absolutely nothing
02:43 - but I can in draw I can say okay let's
02:48 - make a so let's make a loop I'm going to
02:51 - say for VAR a equals zero a a is less
02:55 - than 2 pi a plus equals some amount like
03:00 - zero point one I'm going to say okay I
03:03 - need to solve for X and I'm going to
03:05 - have an R radius R equals 100 or 200 100
03:11 - is fine so x equals R times cosine of
03:15 - that angle and y equals R times sine of
03:18 - that angle so if I just draw a bunch of
03:21 - points at those X's and Y's and if I
03:25 - start also by translating because I want
03:28 - the origin point just for this example
03:31 - to be in the center of the window if I
03:34 - run this and maybe I need to say a
03:38 - stroke to 55 so you can see those points
03:41 - you can see they're all the points along
03:43 - a circle for every C I'm incrementing an
03:45 - angle and I've got all these points
03:47 - along the circle now I could connect
03:48 - them by saying here begin shape and I
03:52 - could say n shape and instead of point I
03:56 - could say vertex and then now you can
04:00 - see I've got a circle it's actually even
04:02 - filled in but just just so you can see I
04:05 - could say no fill and you can see this
04:08 - now you notice there's a little break
04:10 - point here it's because my last point
04:12 - doesn't actually equal my first point
04:13 - and I could be more thoughtful about
04:15 - this but I could also just say n shape
04:17 - close so if I say and she had closed
04:19 - there then it's now closed so there's
04:24 - the circle so this is me this is like
04:26 - we're just
04:27 - using into this this is not a super
04:29 - ellipse it's an ellipse and it's
04:31 - entirely based on this particular
04:33 - formula now the super ellipse formula
04:37 - looks a little bit different it looks
04:39 - like this X divided by a to the nth
04:44 - power plus y divided by B and by the way
04:49 - the absolute value of those whether X is
04:52 - plus or minus to the nth value equals
04:55 - one so you can see this is actually
04:59 - short I'm sorry this is actually a
05:01 - particular case of this formula what if
05:04 - a equals R and B equals R the wrong side
05:11 - of this pen or maybe I'm not this kind
05:12 - of just getting worse if a equals R B
05:15 - equals R at N equals two what is this
05:18 - formula this is X divided by R squared
05:21 - plus y divided by R squared equals 1 or
05:26 - x squared plus y squared equals R
05:29 - squared
05:30 - the absolute value doesn't matter
05:31 - because a negative our positive is
05:33 - squared it becomes a positive so this
05:35 - formula is actually just a simple case
05:38 - of this formula and in some kitten in
05:41 - the same sense there this is a simplify
05:43 - this these are the ways to calculate the
05:45 - x and y based on theta for this
05:48 - particular formula so a circle is
05:50 - actually all the X&Y points that satisfy
05:52 - this equation x squared plus y squared
05:55 - equals R squared a super ellipse excuse
05:57 - me I'm falling over here I don't have I
06:00 - have superpowers of clumsiness a super
06:03 - ellipse is all of the X and Y's that
06:05 - satisfy this particular formula what if
06:07 - it's n to the fourth power what if you
06:09 - have a different a and a different B
06:11 - what kinds of shapes can you get if you
06:13 - plug different values in so the question
06:15 - is though what are the equivalent polar
06:18 - to Cartesian transformation forms how do
06:20 - you get from theta all the different
06:22 - angles to the X and the y that's how I
06:25 - did it code wise over here write these
06:29 - two formulas were rather simple how do I
06:31 - get the equivalent formulas for the more
06:34 - general super ellipse shape so I could
06:37 - try to derive it but I'm just going to
06:39 - look up the answer for the
06:40 - on Wikipedia and and implement that
06:42 - answer here in this particular code
06:45 - example and perhaps if people are
06:47 - interested I could to another video we
06:49 - could try to look at a bit more behind
06:50 - the math or maths but depending on how
06:53 - you like to say it behind this so let me
06:56 - go back to Wikipedia and I can actually
06:58 - look right here you can see by the way
07:00 - you get different kinds of shapes based
07:03 - on what the value of n is but this is
07:05 - really the formula that I care about so
07:07 - what I care about is how do I solve for
07:09 - x and y as a function of theta function
07:12 - of the angle and here I can see X as a
07:14 - function of theta is the absolute value
07:17 - of theta to the two over N power times a
07:20 - times some function called sine of
07:22 - cosine of theta okay so let's at least
07:25 - see what happens can I copy paste this
07:27 - into my code I can't even select it so
07:29 - I'm going to try to remember this will
07:31 - go back and forth between it so I'm now
07:34 - going to change this to be super lips to
07:36 - comment that out and I'm going to go
07:38 - down here and I'm going to say VAR x
07:41 - equals I've already forgotten the
07:43 - absolute value of cosine of that angle
07:47 - and now I've got a little awkwardness
07:50 - because I've got these variables called
07:52 - a and B here and I want to keep that so
07:55 - I'm actually going to just change this
07:58 - to angle I'm going to use the word angle
08:01 - here just to be a bit more explicit
08:05 - there so I want an absolute value of
08:07 - cosine of angle two and I want to take
08:11 - that and put it to what the the absolute
08:17 - value of cosine to the two divided by
08:19 - N's power so let's make a variable
08:23 - called na which is going to be two
08:25 - divided by n so to the NA power so X is
08:30 - I know the absolute value of cosine of
08:32 - the angle to the two over ends power
08:36 - times what a times what some function
08:43 - called SGN which i will make up myself
08:45 - SG n of cosine of that angle so this I
08:53 - don't have a lot of space
08:54 - so I'm going to move this out so now you
08:56 - can see it you can see this entire this
08:58 - is me implementing that exact formula
09:00 - the absolute value of cosine of the
09:02 - angle to the two over N power times a
09:05 - times this function called sine of
09:07 - cosine of angle which I'll get you and
09:09 - now I need to do why is actually the
09:10 - same thing but change this to sign
09:12 - change this to B and change this to sine
09:15 - so and this is why so we need a few more
09:18 - variables here instead of our I need a
09:21 - and B so I'm going to I'm going to make
09:24 - them both equal to 100 right now and I
09:26 - need an N and I'm going to make n just
09:29 - for right now equal to 2 so if n is
09:32 - equal to 2 this should actually get us
09:33 - just that original plain old circle
09:36 - right because what's 2 divided by 2 is 1
09:39 - to the 1 power is just cosine of angle
09:42 - so now how do we deal with this sine
09:44 - function so the sine function is
09:46 - actually a special function that just
09:49 - says that you want the sine of whatever
09:53 - any number that you pass in there if
09:55 - that number of positive I should get the
09:57 - value 1 if that number is negative I
10:00 - should get the value negative 1 and if
10:02 - that value is 0 I should get the value 0
10:04 - so the sine function is just a function
10:06 - that takes any value and tells you
10:08 - whether it's positive or negative so we
10:11 - can actually write a function in p5 that
10:13 - does that for us so back over here if I
10:17 - write a function and call it s GN and it
10:21 - gets some value all I have to do is say
10:23 - if value is greater than 0 return 1 else
10:27 - if value is less than 0 return negative
10:32 - 1 else return 0 so this is a sine
10:36 - function it receives a value and this is
10:39 - very long-winded I'm sure you could come
10:40 - up with some clever condensed shorthand
10:42 - way of writing this but I'm being very
10:44 - explicit greater than 0 give me a 1 less
10:47 - than 0 give me a negative 1 or L 0 this
10:50 - is actually going to kind of tell us
10:51 - what quadrant Rinne in that super
10:53 - ellipse so we should now we have the
10:56 - formula in here we should now instead
10:58 - we're not using this simplified version
11:00 - anymore we're using this formula now we
11:02 - should be able to get a nice super
11:04 - ellipse so let me go back here whoops
11:06 - and hit refresh
11:08 - I see the regular old circle that's good
11:11 - so let's get a little crazy and let's
11:13 - put like the number four in here and see
11:15 - what I get
11:16 - ah you can see now I have a rounded
11:18 - rectangle kind of almost so let's make a
11:20 - slider for n so I'm going to create a
11:25 - slider and I'm going to say slider
11:28 - equals create slider slot when you make
11:31 - a slider you for arguments what is the
11:33 - minimum value what is the maximum value
11:35 - what is the starting value and what is
11:37 - the increment and what I'm going to do
11:41 - is in draw I'm going to say N equals
11:44 - slider dot value so now whenever I tweak
11:48 - that slider I should be able to change
11:50 - feel it so that's N equals two and you
11:53 - can see as I move the slider what I get
11:55 - with now that was like really hard to
11:57 - see but you can see as I move so I'm
11:58 - getting all the different possible super
12:01 - ellipse shapes now I could also change a
12:03 - and B like for example what if I make a
12:06 - 200 and B is 100 you can see that's just
12:09 - an ellipse now and I get other kinds of
12:12 - shapes with that so you can see this is
12:14 - the beginning of the super formula it's
12:17 - just the super ellipse I have a single
12:19 - angle I have some weird sort of
12:21 - conversion that I need to do to get an x
12:23 - and y and then I have a begin shape and
12:25 - end shape so in the next video what I'm
12:27 - going to do is instead of showing you
12:28 - how to do this with just let me come
12:31 - back how to do this with just this
12:34 - particular formula the next formula I
12:37 - want to approach is how do I get all the
12:39 - X and Y's that satisfy I'm going to
12:43 - scroll up to UM put this particular
12:45 - formula so when I use this particular
12:47 - formula which just has a lot more math
12:50 - in it but essentially the codes going to
12:52 - be exactly the same I'm going to you're
12:54 - going to see how you can get all a
12:55 - variety of these different kinds of
12:57 - shapes and then at some point once we
13:00 - get to there we should be able to then
13:02 - take this formula and move it into 3d to
13:05 - create volumes so I actually have never
13:08 - done this part before I've done the one
13:10 - the super ellipse and the 2d super shape
13:12 - and this that'll come in the next video
13:15 - which I'll release some point from now
13:17 - and then
13:18 - move into 3d so I hope you enjoyed
13:20 - watching the super ellipse video give it
13:22 - a try try adding some colors in it can
13:24 - you make a super rainbow I don't know
13:25 - what that would be
13:26 - try making that and see what you get
13:29 - what other kind of interactive features
13:30 - can you do what kind of questions do you
13:32 - have about the math and let me know how
13:34 - that goes thanks for watching
