00:00 - hello and welcome to another guest
00:02 - conductor video here on the coding train
00:05 - now it's been a minute since i had a
00:07 - guest video
00:08 - i'm hoping that 2021 that i can really
00:12 - pick up the pace here i have a goal of
00:14 - having at least one
00:15 - guest video per month and what's a
00:17 - better time to start than
00:19 - march now in case you've missed some of
00:21 - the other guest conductor videos
00:23 - i featured a 3d modeling live stream
00:26 - from chrissy brimage
00:27 - a cozy coding session with aaron davey
00:30 - and a video by amigos code and you can
00:32 - find all of these
00:33 - in the guest conductors playlist on the
00:35 - coding train today i am
00:37 - so excited to feature a video from lily
00:40 - james
00:41 - lily is channeling her engineering
00:43 - education
00:44 - dance training and resourcefulness
00:46 - through queer
00:47 - femme and black identities into a wild
00:50 - and wonderful youtube series
00:52 - twirling tech goddess as a computer
00:55 - science major
00:56 - lily encourages radical diversity and
00:57 - inclusion by making the process of
00:59 - learning tech more fun
01:00 - accessible and relatable to people
01:02 - underrepresented in stem
01:04 - so the very first thing that you should
01:05 - do right now and i'll put up a card and
01:07 - maybe an animation to remind you
01:09 - is go and subscribe to the twirling tech

01:12 - subscribe click the notifications button
01:14 - you don't want to miss anytime
01:16 - lily releases a new video now to be
01:18 - honest i had a pretty hard time
01:20 - picking which video of lilies to feature
01:23 - and show here on the coding train
01:25 - they're all amazing and and i think the
01:26 - word i should really use here is
01:28 - fabulous
01:29 - but i've settled on one and it is called
01:31 - 3d printing a motorized
01:33 - high fashion hat i don't talk a lot
01:36 - about hardware or 3d or fashion on the
01:38 - coding terrain
01:39 - and this is really the one of the main
01:40 - reasons you should make sure to also
01:42 - subscribe to twirling tech goddess you
01:43 - really want to
01:44 - round out your youtube education lili's
01:46 - creativity
01:47 - in using a combination of 3d printing
01:49 - alongside open source models is really
01:51 - aligned
01:52 - with the coding trains goals of making
01:53 - technology approachable
01:55 - as part of this video and thank you to
01:57 - lily james for introducing me to this
01:58 - wonderful organization coding train is
02:00 - making a donation
02:01 - to queer asterisk a colorado-based 501c3
02:05 - nonprofit
02:06 - providing queer informed counseling
02:07 - services educational trainings
02:09 - and community programming i'll include a
02:11 - link to the queer asterisk website in
02:13 - this video's description where you can
02:14 - learn more and make a donation if you'd
02:16 - also like to support them
02:17 - but we are here to see the twirling tech
02:20 - goddess
02:21 - i will note this is a reposting of an
02:23 - existing video on her channel so what
02:25 - i'd really like you to do as strange as

02:53 - cutting train video
02:55 - hi inventors i'm lee lee the twirling
02:57 - tech goddess i'm black i dance i'm queer
03:00 - and
03:00 - i'm an engineer welcome to the twerk
03:02 - shop a show that explicitly encourages
03:04 - radical diversity and inclusion by
03:06 - making the process of learning tech more
03:08 - fun accessible and relatable to people
03:10 - underrepresented in stem
03:11 - each week you'll come along with me as i
03:13 - create something fabulous using cutting
03:15 - edge tools and technologies
03:16 - then i'll put it through my patented
03:18 - twirl test to make sure that it's stage
03:19 - ready
03:20 - that's right we twirl with our tech
03:22 - because you know what they say
03:23 - the family that slays together increases
03:26 - their socioeconomic status together
03:32 - [Music]
03:44 - on this episode we're going to be making
03:46 - a motorized headpiece using one of my
03:48 - favorite technologies
03:50 - 3d printing i'll walk you through the
03:53 - hardware and software that we'll be
03:55 - using
03:55 - for the production and design of the
03:57 - headpiece and then i'll introduce you to
03:59 - the motorized
04:00 - element that we'll use to make it move
04:01 - and spin a little backstory when i was
04:04 - on tour as a figure skater a french
04:05 - compatriot of mine noticed that anytime
04:07 - i saw something cute in a shop
04:09 - i would hold it up to my head like so
04:12 - so fall semester i'm walking through the
04:14 - bookstore on campus here
04:16 - and i spot a little heart that's like
04:18 - moving and i
04:19 - knew i needed to have it on my head so i
04:21 - asked the sales clerk where can i get
04:22 - one of those and i basically blacked out
04:25 - as he spouted off all this information
04:26 - about how to make it and i had no idea
04:28 - what
04:28 - i was talking about so here we are two
04:30 - semesters later and i finally have the
04:31 - tools and skills to make it happen
04:33 - so let's get started
04:42 - so this is a 3d printer this one belongs
04:45 - to the school
04:46 - and it was about two thousand dollars
04:48 - this one belongs to me
04:49 - and it's a tenth of the price and a lot
04:51 - less cumbersome
04:52 - so this one doesn't even work so let's
04:54 - get this raggedy piece out of here and
04:56 - get to work
04:59 - this is the bed it gets hot
05:02 - this is the extruder it gets hotter this
05:05 - is the filament you'll use
05:07 - and you feed this filament into the
05:10 - extruder
05:11 - it melts it drips it on the bed
05:14 - makes a 3d print it's amazing
05:27 - there's multiple ways to get the image
05:30 - to the extruder
05:32 - via this processor one of the ways is
05:35 - using an external
05:36 - sd card you can also connect it directly
05:39 - to your laptop using a usb cable or your
05:42 - desktop
05:49 - when it comes to 3d printing you first
05:51 - need the document that you want to print
05:53 - much like any 2d print job on a paper
05:56 - printer you can print a pre-existing
05:57 - document or you can create your own
05:59 - document
05:59 - we'll touch more on creating 3d models
06:01 - in a future video where i'll be creating
06:03 - my own high heels
06:04 - today however we'll be using a
06:06 - pre-existing document to create a
06:08 - motorized headpiece
06:09 - the documents have authors and those
06:12 - authors are published as specific sites
06:14 - sites such as yegi and cults 3d have 3d
06:17 - prints that authors
06:18 - artists creators post for sale if you
06:21 - purchase the right 3d printer however it
06:22 - may in fact come with some complimentary
06:24 - exclusive 3d models designed by
06:26 - excellent designers for that specific
06:29 - brand such as
06:29 - ultimaker there are also document
06:32 - libraries of sorts that offer open
06:33 - source free download of pre-existing
06:35 - document models such as
06:37 - thingiverse which is hands down the most
06:39 - popular and the one we'll be using for
06:41 - this project
06:42 - now let's go over to thingiverse and
06:44 - download the gearheart document
06:46 - link in the description these downloads
06:49 - come in various types and you'll want to
06:50 - look for the
06:51 - stl file to download that one there are
06:54 - other file types but for now we'll just
06:55 - focus on
06:56 - our dot stl files next we'll download a
07:00 - 3d printing app think of this as our
07:02 - print preview
07:03 - for this project i'll be using cura link
07:06 - in the description below
07:07 - from inside cura we'll import our stl
07:10 - file this takes our 3d model and slices
07:12 - it creating a new render that can be
07:14 - printed layer by layer
07:15 - now let's get the document to the
07:17 - printer and let the printer
07:19 - do its thing
07:30 - [Music]
07:34 - first i printed a prototype and i'm glad
07:36 - i did because this specific print had an
07:39 - enclosed bottom and i needed an open
07:41 - bottom for the motor
07:42 - after finding the parts that better
07:44 - suited my needs and removing the parts
07:46 - that didn't i merged those files and
07:48 - made a second print
07:49 - which is the one that i provided for you
07:51 - all link in the description
07:53 - and now let's talk post production
07:56 - so depending on the pla you use you may
07:58 - or may not need
07:59 - or want to smooth the surface of your
08:01 - print
08:02 - as you can see up close prints leave
08:05 - layer lines
08:06 - so to smooth that surface you may want
08:09 - to use
08:09 - sandpaper to get rid of some of those
08:11 - lines
08:12 - and you can also soak your piece in
08:16 - acetone or nail polish remover once
08:18 - you've done that you can also prime the
08:20 - surface with a plasti-dip or primer
08:23 - if you're gonna paint on top of it or
08:26 - adhese any glitter
08:27 - or be dazzling effects so this is your
08:30 - motor
08:31 - it's a few bucks link in the description
08:33 - you can just get these on amazon
08:35 - super simple you power it and it spins
08:39 - this is going to be our external power
08:41 - source it's a battery pack
08:43 - four batteries go inside you can get
08:45 - these in the size of three batteries
08:47 - this four batteries is six volts
08:49 - three batteries is going to be four
08:51 - volts and two batteries is three volts
08:53 - the thing that i love about this is it
08:55 - also has this handy dandy on
08:57 - off switch so we can turn it on and make
09:00 - sure we have
09:00 - power if we see a little spark we know
09:03 - that this is working so i'm going to use
09:04 - these
09:05 - alligator clips available at any
09:07 - hardware store these are a few bucks
09:10 - so that i don't actually have to touch
09:11 - the wires now that they're live
09:15 - and i'm going to connect one of those to
09:17 - each of the rivets
09:20 - on the motor and boom
09:22 - [Music]
09:26 - oh super handy so
09:29 - now you'll get the idea if i take the
09:32 - fan piece off
09:34 - pop the headpiece on
09:38 - houston we have liftoff
09:42 - to turn this into a headpiece we're
09:45 - gonna need a few things
09:47 - essentials handy-dandy glue gun and glue
09:50 - sticks
09:52 - your favorite pair of scissors your
09:54 - least favorite headband
09:57 - and a small tupperware with lid
10:00 - and keep your motor nearby so we're
10:03 - going to build from the bottom
10:04 - up is my strategy so i take the headband
10:07 - which is going to rest here on my head
10:10 - and we're going to glue the bottom
10:14 - or the base of the tupperware onto our
10:18 - headband
10:18 - and that will house the motor
10:24 - and then we'll put our lid on the motor
10:28 - and then hot glue our headpiece
10:31 - onto the lid which will allow the motor
10:34 - to stay
10:34 - weatherproof inside let's get started
10:48 - [Music]
11:12 - me
11:16 - [Music]
11:22 - so now that this thing is fully
11:24 - assembled
11:26 - i'm already thinking of finishing
11:28 - touches and
11:30 - embellishments that i want to make to
11:32 - cover the headband and cover the
11:33 - tupperware and i invite you to play and
11:35 - have fun with
11:36 - your finishing touches and
11:37 - embellishments please
11:39 - share your photos and videos of your
11:41 - creations down in the comments below
11:44 - and they better not look like mine
11:49 - now let's take this headpiece for a
11:50 - twirl a wearable
11:52 - isn't useful to me if it's not stage
11:54 - ready so i'm gonna go get changed and
11:56 - i'll see y'all on the
12:00 - [Music]
