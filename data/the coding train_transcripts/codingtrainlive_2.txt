02:12 - uh just doing my sound check i see a few
02:14 - of you in the chat
02:15 - asking what are the topics for today
02:18 - um i am going to look at extending
02:22 - a self-avoiding walk into 3d
02:25 - i am going to look at the bezier
02:27 - function in
02:28 - p5.js and i will be demoing a
02:32 - new discord bot that is in the coding
02:35 - train discord
02:36 - and um what else what else
02:40 - i think that's about it i'll also be
02:42 - streaming tomorrow
02:44 - the pinned comment hopefully has this
02:46 - list okay
02:47 - let me know if my audio is working all
02:49 - right b we are beginning
02:51 - in three and a half minutes

06:34 - good morning hello happy i was about to
06:36 - say happy friday but it's not friday
06:38 - it's
06:38 - thursday and i'm here live
06:41 - on the coding train broadcasting to you
06:46 - and i see that my mic is on and i see
06:47 - that my picture is visible to me
06:49 - so hopefully all that's working you oh
06:51 - gloria did i just wake you up with my
06:53 - loud voice
06:55 - uh i wish i need a dog cam i really need
06:57 - a puppy cam where are you going gloria
06:59 - oh you're going downstairs stay with me
07:01 - stay up here have a little rest
07:03 - oh okay i gotta pay attention to you
07:06 - welcome if this is your
07:08 - first time tuning into a live stream oh
07:11 - boy
07:11 - um welcome i already said welcome this
07:14 - is kind of what happens i'll get lost
07:16 - and lose track of what i'm talking about
07:18 - and where i am and what's going on
07:20 - but i hopefully get to some coding stuff
07:22 - that will interest you
07:24 - um if if this is your first time at all
07:27 - ever tuning into anything the coding
07:29 - drain then well
07:30 - by golly really welcome but um
07:34 - and what this is is this is a weekly
07:37 - semi-weekly missing a lot of weeks here
07:40 - and there probably
07:41 - i had to guess i think i probably make
07:43 - 30 to 35 weeks out of the year
07:46 - a live stream where i cover a random
07:48 - smattering of topics
07:50 - in coding particularly around graphics
07:53 - and i'm using javascript and i often use
07:57 - various tools from the processing
07:59 - foundation like p5.js and processing to
08:01 - make
08:02 - creative and fun playful projects for
08:05 - you the people of the internet to
08:06 - hopefully
08:07 - learn something from be inspired by and
08:09 - go off and make your own
08:11 - version of it but this live stream is
08:13 - the unstructured sort of companion to
08:15 - what is otherwise on the channel
08:17 - a lot of sort of sequence tutorials for
08:19 - certain kinds of tasks and projects
08:21 - et cetera this is very unplanned
08:23 - unscripted um
08:25 - and kind of a mess but i'm back
08:30 - because it's been a really rough year i
08:32 - know it's been a rough year for all of
08:34 - you
08:34 - watching for everyone around the world
08:36 - um it's been a tricky year for me i
08:38 - let me just take a moment here to say
08:41 - congratulations to
08:42 - all of the teachers um education workers
08:46 - the students whether you're in you know
08:48 - second grade
08:49 - seventh grade in high school in college
08:52 - in graduate school
08:54 - wow i mean in all industries and types
08:57 - of walks of life it's been
08:59 - a tough year but i know this is the
09:00 - moment where a lot of people are
09:01 - graduating
09:03 - and i just want to say well done people
09:06 - it's been really hard and strange and i
09:09 - have done
09:09 - uh i would say a medium to poor job over
09:12 - the last
09:13 - year and um i i'm looking forward to
09:17 - having a little bit of a break finally
09:19 - this summer um which it's it's been
09:21 - quite a while um and hopefully you're
09:23 - gonna get one
09:24 - as well two fix the wrinkled green
09:27 - screen says cat king
09:29 - where is it is it like just this little
09:32 - tiny thing is bothering you it is kind
09:33 - of bothering me as well
09:35 - okay there we go
09:38 - i don't know if that was in royce is in
09:41 - ninth grade
09:43 - um i hope your end of year wraps up well
09:47 - um and that you uh hopefully you're what
09:50 - aren't you in school right now i don't
09:52 - know what but maybe you're in a time
09:54 - zone where you're not in school right
09:55 - now
09:55 - if you're watching this in school
09:58 - i don't know i don't know what to say to
10:02 - that all right i have fixed
10:05 - that let's see all right what do i have
10:07 - uh let me thank um today's sponsor
10:09 - uh oh i have to go oh i have to go over
10:11 - here and reveal some stuff
10:14 - um uh that's me this is my sponsor of
10:17 - today brilliant
10:18 - um if you think that learning from
10:21 - watching youtube or from having a
10:23 - geometry mug
10:25 - is uh for you then guess what's really
10:27 - for you uh brilliant you can sign up for
10:29 - free at brilliant.org
10:31 - codingtrain um it's a wonderful
10:33 - educational website with all sorts of
10:35 - interactive lessons in
10:37 - uh the sciences and math and computer
10:39 - science and programming and
10:40 - geometry and all the stuff that i love i
10:42 - think you might like it too
10:44 - uh so check that out i'll come back and
10:46 - look at the website a little more uh
10:47 - during in halfway through today's uh
10:50 - stream
10:51 - so um what do i have uh
10:55 - for you today
11:00 - so i'm try i aspire
11:03 - to have a plan and a schedule and set
11:06 - topics
11:07 - and segments and it's been i don't know
11:10 - how long i got to figure out like how
11:12 - long i've really been doing this
11:14 - because i can tell you that i've been
11:16 - making video tutorials since
11:18 - probably for 10 at least 10 years
11:22 - when did i first start uploading those
11:24 - videos to youtube
11:26 - i think around 2015. i think that's
11:30 - right
11:30 - when did i do my first live stream well
11:33 - that's
11:34 - findable it's there it's still on the
11:36 - channel
11:37 - uh when did i start calling myself
11:39 - coding
11:40 - redacted when did i start calling the
11:44 - channel coding train all of those things
11:47 - are um points
11:50 - in the history of this project that i
11:52 - would like to kind of like accumulate
11:54 - and track maybe
11:55 - you know by the way there's no wikipedia
11:58 - page for the cody gray i don't know if
11:59 - they're
11:59 - merits being one or there should be one
12:02 - but um
12:02 - anybody's got some spare cycles and
12:05 - wants to create one to sort of track
12:07 - some of this
12:07 - uh history i'm happy to help i'm not
12:09 - gonna uh help edit the page but
12:11 - happily help provide any of the
12:14 - information and references for that
12:16 - but i'm just thinking about are there
12:17 - any anniversaries coming up but the
12:18 - reason why i brought this up is like
12:20 - i've been doing this for quite a while
12:21 - and still it's just a mess and um
12:25 - i'm i have some changes upcoming i'm i'm
12:27 - hoping to
12:28 - redo where i live broadcast from
12:31 - um and have a bit more of a a larger
12:34 - space to work with with some different
12:36 - with some
12:37 - i want to get some kind of toys in that
12:39 - space um working with
12:41 - uh like a vinyl cutter and some other
12:44 - physical stuff that i want to try to
12:45 - make stuff
12:46 - live with some like led like things so
12:49 - that's coming
12:50 - um but right now i'm still i'm where i
12:53 - am mentally physically emotionally is
12:56 - just trying to
12:57 - get the academic year wrapped up and get
13:00 - organized for the summer
13:02 - and i'm still playing catch-up so the
13:04 - topics that i have today
13:06 - are pretty much um i'm just sort of
13:10 - looking at the chat here so first i want
13:11 - to share some community contributions
13:14 - um i will be doing that this is the
13:18 - community contributions that's my
13:20 - community contributions theme song
13:22 - uh i want to do that i am very close to
13:26 - releasing
13:27 - a coding challenge video about a
13:29 - self-avoiding walk
13:30 - and one of the suggested exercises i
13:33 - suggest in the video
13:34 - is to extend it into 3d so i would like
13:37 - to
13:38 - show a version of that and i haven't had
13:40 - time to make it so i'll just try making
13:42 - that on today's live stream
13:44 - that's a plan uh and then oh
13:47 - by golly i have failed
13:50 - i mean i failed like get get out get out
13:53 - your notepad
13:54 - if you want to list all my failures in
13:56 - life you better have a lot of pages in
13:58 - that notepad but i
13:59 - and i haven't failed yet i'm um but i
14:01 - have failed to
14:03 - complete something that i have promised
14:05 - to make
14:06 - um and i uh i want to make sure that i
14:09 - do that in june
14:10 - and what it is is creating video
14:13 - tutorials
14:14 - that were requested by donors to the
14:17 - processing foundation
14:20 - annual fundraiser so i don't know if
14:22 - this is easily
14:23 - uh findable but let me go oh you don't
14:26 - see what i'm looking at
14:28 - this is the processing foundation
14:29 - website um if i click over onto
14:32 - donate um i wonder if i can
14:35 - find many i assume some of you watching
14:38 - here are in this wonderful list
14:40 - of names of people thank you for
14:43 - supporting the processing foundation
14:45 - i would like to look for
14:48 - [Music]
14:53 - the annual fundraiser
14:57 - it's very hard to google things with the
15:00 - word processing in it
15:01 - because basically all of my results are
15:03 - processing transactions for donorbox
15:06 - ah somebody will find this link for me
15:08 - and and
15:09 - and and tell me ah support p5 there we
15:11 - go
15:13 - oh that's 2019 donor box page
15:17 - uh what if i change this to 2020
15:22 - very hard life is hard people life is
15:25 - full of 404 errors let me just tell you
15:27 - that
15:29 - all of my many years on this planet none
15:32 - outside of this planet as of yet i've
15:35 - been full
15:36 - of so many 404 errors boy i'm not
15:38 - prepared
15:39 - um but uh one of the rewards for
15:42 - donating to the processing foundation
15:43 - was to
15:44 - uh request a video topic from the coding
15:46 - train
15:48 - um and so um
15:51 - two topics that were requested from the
15:53 - donors one was bezier curve
15:55 - and one was the copy function so i want
15:57 - to spend a little time exploring both of
15:59 - those functions
16:01 - to prepare for what i might put in the
16:03 - actual and i'm thinking this is gonna be
16:04 - like a 10 minute video
16:06 - so you the viewer if you choose to stay
16:08 - with me here today
16:10 - the opportunity to help provide some
16:11 - suggestions or things that i might
16:12 - demonstrate
16:13 - um in the eventual tutorial so uh um um
16:16 - that i'm gonna make so that's
16:18 - that's really on my agenda am i
16:20 - forgetting anything
16:22 - i'm looking here just checking the
16:24 - discord oh my god i forgot the most
16:27 - important thing
16:33 - oh my goodness not the most important
16:36 - thing but a
16:37 - uh because truly they're all
16:39 - everything's they're all important
16:40 - or not important equally and unimportant
16:43 - actually
16:44 - if i really think about it but i would
16:46 - like to demonstrate a new
16:49 - discord bot that is in the coding train
16:51 - discord channel if you're not already in
16:53 - there
16:54 - um let me press a button which will
16:57 - hopefully post it into the chat
16:59 - um the discord channel where we have a
17:02 - lot of plans for the discord channel
17:03 - this summer to hope to
17:05 - do more kind of community engagement
17:07 - very excited about that
17:08 - but there is a new bot that is related
17:10 - to my
17:11 - book of random numbers which if i can
17:15 - find my sound effects
17:17 - i found that was very loud that was me
17:20 - who was loud i found it i had it lost
17:22 - for a while it was in the cabana
17:25 - because i had been using it for um the
17:27 - mouse conference video
17:29 - and i had left it there so it's a little
17:31 - uh weathered
17:32 - a little more weather than it usually is
17:34 - and we haven't done this in a while oh
17:36 - oh wait it's time let's look at the bot
17:38 - because the bot we're starting over
17:40 - today
17:42 - i'm starting i am sisyphus with the
17:45 - random numbers
17:47 - [Laughter]
17:49 - um so i i am sisyphus with the random
17:52 - numbers
17:53 - i am destined to just start this over
17:55 - but today
17:57 - it's this is a momentous occasion
17:58 - because i'm going to start over
18:00 - reading all oh and some lights are
18:03 - blinking i think someone gave a little
18:05 - chat message oh it was simone charlo
18:07 - thank you simone
18:09 - um i am going to start over my project
18:14 - which is to read this entire book i have
18:16 - learned so much about this book i have
18:18 - learned what is
18:20 - quite possibly the the incredibly
18:23 - obvious
18:24 - which is that when this book says a
18:26 - million random digits
18:28 - it has a million random single digits in
18:31 - them
18:32 - i have always read them in groups of
18:33 - five
18:35 - and was oft made the mistake of
18:37 - referring to it as
18:39 - one million five digit numbers which is
18:41 - not all the case there's two hundred
18:42 - thousand five digit numbers
18:46 - but um let's go let's get to the bot
18:48 - because um and then i will
18:49 - um uh read some random numbers uh yeah
18:52 - and so remember how it was saying hello
18:53 - to anybody who's a new viewer
18:55 - it takes me quite a while to get to any
18:57 - coding
18:59 - you know usually i have about 10 minutes
19:00 - left in my 2 hour live stream by the
19:02 - time i'm actually coding something so
19:03 - let me
19:04 - pull let me just do a couple things here
19:07 - let me switch back to here
19:09 - i'm going to pull up discord
19:12 - and oh my goodness and do this quick
19:15 - little
19:16 - fancy trick i have then i need to turn
19:20 - on a streamer mode
19:23 - privacy and safety it must be there
19:25 - right where is the streamer mode it
19:26 - doesn't automatically go on streamer
19:28 - mode
19:28 - is enabled okay so now i'm able to
19:32 - hopefully safe safely
19:37 - nicole nicole bella says omg i'm so glad
19:40 - you have corrected how you'll read the
19:42 - numbers right
19:44 - i mean like it's got i've got
19:47 - i mean i mean right thank you for
19:50 - validating this
19:51 - i feel seen right now so seen okay
19:55 - um
19:58 - all right let's see here
20:01 - i'm going over to here
20:04 - okay so this is the coding train discord
20:06 - lots of channels um i get um i still
20:08 - manage to get
20:09 - a lot of individual emails asking for
20:12 - coding help
20:13 - and i mean in my heart of hearts i would
20:16 - like to respond to every one of those
20:18 - but i just don't have the capacity
20:20 - to um and so this is where i point
20:22 - people to all these channels there's a
20:23 - volunteer team of moderators
20:25 - and lots of friendly faces in the
20:27 - discord so please come and join you can
20:29 - get help with all these different areas
20:33 - but what i am here and then for you
20:35 - there's also there's my favorite channel
20:37 - in the discord which is the pets
20:38 - channel uh oh ah you know what
20:42 - it's maybe the pets is a strong second
20:44 - to introductions
20:45 - i just i read all the introductions by
20:47 - the way it's my favorite channel i just
20:49 - love
20:49 - getting to know everybody who's joining
20:51 - and how they found the videos and that
20:53 - sort of thing so please
20:54 - introduce yourself in there i aspire to
20:57 - maybe
20:57 - i don't know if i aspire this maybe
20:58 - someday it'll be too many people
21:00 - introducing themselves and i won't be
21:01 - able to read them all but
21:02 - i really love that anyway what i am
21:03 - looking for is i yes
21:05 - this is the channel that you're going to
21:07 - want to try
21:08 - the stuff that i'm about to demonstrate
21:10 - to you uh
21:12 - bot testing but i am always very
21:15 - cautious on the internet
21:16 - in terms of what i'm showing on my live
21:17 - stream uh
21:19 - only because i've learned my lesson the
21:23 - hard way
21:23 - and i still get it wrong you know as all
21:25 - of you who have your
21:27 - notebooks full of my private api keys
21:30 - but
21:30 - um here here's my bot demo
21:34 - uh channel so in this bot demo channel
21:36 - which i'm going to
21:37 - there is a new discord bot thank you to
21:39 - saint plays
21:40 - uh who's the manager of the discord
21:44 - david i'm sure who's contributed to this
21:45 - and many other people
21:48 - i'm going to do question mark this new
21:50 - bot let's see here
21:52 - question mark is the way i know there's
21:54 - slash commands now on discord
21:56 - maybe someday we will get to that but
21:59 - the
21:59 - oh i hate how see i need this is my
22:02 - dream in the next
22:03 - live streaming studio is to have a full
22:06 - body camera because i have to the camera
22:09 - is quite close to me
22:11 - so i have to shrink myself and then i'm
22:13 - cut off here
22:14 - which really drives me curiously because
22:15 - i really want to point all the way to
22:17 - that help thing
22:18 - someday someday i'm i'm hoping i'm in an
22:22 - attic and i'm hoping to move to a garage
22:24 - long story for another time if it
22:26 - happens i'll let you know
22:29 - uh question mark i might not be taking a
22:31 - few weeks off if this is happening
22:33 - though because i'll be moving
22:34 - uh question mark uh help
22:37 - um so if i press that
22:40 - um that's how you trigger the choo choo
22:43 - bot
22:44 - so the choo choo bot um actually
22:47 - the choo choo bot which um
22:50 - oh oh i see yes yes yes the choo choo
22:53 - bot is
22:54 - essentially the bot uh now i remember
22:57 - what's happening
22:58 - the choo choo bot i am looking at the
23:00 - chat but just very
23:01 - you can't rely on that to answer sid
23:03 - hart that's question
23:06 - the choo choo bot is the coding train
23:08 - discord bot that is covered
23:11 - in my if i think i go under more
23:14 - under learning discord bot this is my
23:17 - series
23:18 - about how to code your own discord bot
23:20 - it's a series of six videos
23:23 - in theory i would like to there's many
23:24 - more things that i didn't get to that i
23:26 - would like to get to
23:27 - um but if you want to learn how to code
23:29 - your own bot check out these videos
23:32 - but i you know some of the features that
23:33 - are demonstrated are
23:35 - if i just type in i know this is like so
23:37 - tiny i should i just do this
23:40 - i'm i'm going to give up and do this uh
23:42 - choo choo
23:45 - if i do um let me do this uh choo choo
23:48 - oh no question mark choo choo
23:52 - i will get a random reply
23:56 - let's try it one more time
23:59 - i love how people emoji right ding right
24:01 - okay
24:03 - i'll get a random reply another feature
24:05 - is a gif
24:06 - if i just type gif uh it uses the tenor
24:10 - api to pull a random gif with the coding
24:12 - train
24:12 - search but if i say gif uh kitten
24:17 - [Laughter]
24:26 - by the way i'm supposed to have unlocked
24:29 - on my channel
24:30 - a beta feature and youtube or alpha
24:32 - feature called clips
24:34 - i know this has probably been something
24:35 - that's been on twitch for like the last
24:37 - 300 years where you can clip out and
24:39 - share separately as different
24:41 - moments of live streams and videos so
24:43 - you can get a thing of me going
24:48 - here we need a new coding train gif
24:53 - which will somebody will make
24:57 - but it hasn't i don't think it's
24:58 - available on my channel yet i got to get
25:00 - in touch with my
25:01 - youtube friends all right uh
25:06 - what was i saying ah that's one feature
25:08 - another feature
25:09 - what else did i do i did the message
25:13 - the gif i gotta look at my video
25:16 - tutorials
25:17 - i guess that was kind of it
25:21 - hello world posting gifs and then i like
25:23 - organized the code
25:25 - etc etc so that's kind of it but there's
25:28 - some new features which aren't in the
25:29 - tutorials but were implemented by
25:32 - uh the wonderful coding trained discord
25:34 - team and really mostly all
25:37 - same plays um kobe
25:40 - uh and if i do help now what i'm looking
25:42 - for
25:43 - is some new commands
25:47 - random walk find assign
25:51 - get number set easter egg i have no idea
25:54 - what that does
25:55 - random number reading set reading all of
25:58 - those things
26:01 - all of these are related to accessing
26:04 - the contents
26:06 - of this particular random number book
26:09 - and
26:10 - getting your very own unique
26:13 - random number now you will have two
26:16 - things
26:17 - you will have an index if you get one if
26:20 - you choose to get one of these yourself
26:23 - you will have an index into this book
26:27 - one there are one million indices can we
26:30 - ever get to the point where every
26:32 - index is taken by a viewer of the coding
26:35 - train
26:35 - probably not but maybe you will also
26:39 - then have a
26:40 - five-digit random number that
26:43 - starts from that index and that random
26:46 - number
26:47 - that index that that five-digit random
26:50 - number
26:52 - is the starting point to generate your
26:55 - very own
26:56 - unique and custom random walk
26:59 - visualization so to uh
27:03 - to really explain what i'm talking about
27:05 - here i need to
27:06 - circle back and go to
27:10 - coding challenges oh this is all coming
27:12 - full circle
27:14 - random walk this is coding challenge
27:17 - number 52
27:19 - from 2017.
27:22 - uh you could watch this video tutorial
27:24 - but i will just show you
27:26 - the code for it
27:30 - this is what it does is it looks at a
27:33 - random number this is using the p5.js
27:35 - random function one zero one two or
27:37 - three
27:38 - moves up down left right
27:42 - um and if we let this run for one
27:45 - million
27:45 - cycles eventually we would have a
27:48 - particular pattern
27:50 - so what if instead of picking the
27:52 - numbers from the p5.js
27:54 - random function the numbers were picked
27:57 - from this what is the what was i
28:01 - thinking this was
28:02 - my version of the um the dark hold
28:06 - from the uh coding train dark hold is
28:08 - that what it's called
28:10 - whatever somebody will let me know um
28:15 - you will get your own visualization of
28:18 - the rant that what the random walk would
28:20 - look like if you followed all of the
28:21 - digits into the
28:23 - from from the book so without further
28:25 - ado
28:26 - let me first actually log into p5 web
28:29 - editor
28:31 - let me go back to discord i think what i
28:33 - can do is say question mark random walk
28:36 - and we'll just get one of these
28:40 - so this is the random walk pattern
28:43 - starting from position 196931 in the
28:47 - book
28:49 - and the random number there i'm not sure
28:51 - what uh um kobe maybe we need to work on
28:53 - some of the we'll do some edits here
28:55 - i'm not sure what instead is referring
28:57 - to but with the random number two
28:59 - eight four five one so if i do another
29:03 - one
29:07 - here is so we could just call oh it's
29:09 - question mark i always forget it's
29:10 - question mark
29:11 - i could always just say question mark
29:13 - random walk and i'll get a new pattern
29:15 - here's another one
29:17 - um so uh
29:20 - now ah i see oh instead
29:24 - we couldn't get your input that's why oh
29:26 - because i could do a specific one
29:28 - i can say random walk uh one
29:32 - so this will give the
29:35 - position one in the book this is the
29:37 - random walk and the
29:39 - number and i think actually position
29:40 - zero is actually the first
29:42 - position the random number three two
29:45 - five three three okay so now why am i
29:48 - say why
29:48 - why why is this happening well
29:52 - this is just the stuff that i love it's
29:54 - like the most like
29:56 - oddly strange like obsessive use of
29:59 - a book of random numbers that i could
30:01 - possibly think of
30:03 - and a good demonstration of all sorts of
30:05 - concepts in creative coding and
30:07 - randomness
30:08 - and bots and apis and graphics and node
30:11 - and p5
30:12 - and all that stuff but here's if you if
30:15 - you like what you see so far
30:17 - just wait there's more i'm going to say
30:21 - i think it's
30:22 - get number
30:26 - ah no no no um
30:28 - [Music]
30:30 - let's let's ask for help
30:34 - uh find assign get number
30:38 - supporter user my number
30:46 - my saved random number is
30:51 - so this is my unique random number
30:54 - well it's not it might not be a unique
30:56 - random number it should tell me probably
30:58 - what position i'm in also
31:00 - realizing we've got features go we've
31:01 - got feature requests going on
31:05 - this is my random number so
31:08 - now if i were to
31:11 - uh if i were to say i think i could find
31:14 - it
31:16 - find four two six five one
31:21 - it can be found in the book at row nine
31:24 - zero zero four position
31:25 - seven so these are the row and position
31:27 - i also would like to know the index how
31:28 - do i
31:29 - i wanna set my own random number so
31:31 - let's try set
31:36 - okay ah okay so anybody can do this
31:40 - uh now my number should be 73091
31:44 - let's see yes
31:48 - that's my random number
31:52 - i have generated you a random number so
31:55 - now if you happen to be
31:56 - just you know in theory it would be
31:58 - great if everybody could just
32:00 - like pick but there you once you have
32:01 - one nobody else can take it
32:03 - so if you are a viewer of the coding
32:05 - train all you have to do
32:07 - is just type question mark set
32:10 - uh and it will set a new one for you
32:13 - that's very similar to my previous one
32:16 - wow look at that it's so close um but if
32:19 - if you like
32:22 - you uh if you are a
32:27 - it generated me a random one a sign
32:31 - i don't i don't know how this bot works
32:33 - ah
32:34 - oh no this is only for me
32:43 - um so there's some work to be done so
32:46 - i'm looking at various chats here
32:48 - so you can get your own the idea is that
32:50 - you could get your own random number
32:51 - if you're a supporter if you signed up
32:53 - to join through youtube membership
32:55 - you're able to pick your own or in
32:57 - theory i've assigned you one
32:58 - that you when a new person joins i have
33:00 - a little bit where i assign them a
33:02 - random number
33:04 - but then that random number will
33:08 - generate a particular
33:10 - random walk and where if also
33:13 - what is next what is next in your
33:15 - journey uh besides having
33:18 - a um
33:19 - [Music]
33:21 - um besides having just your own random
33:25 - number and unique random walk
33:27 - pattern that you can generate in the
33:29 - discord well
33:31 - bear with me for a moment and i see
33:34 - uh the creator of the spot kobe typing
33:37 - in here
33:38 - discord manager let me go here so
33:41 - what is happening here well look at
33:45 - these
33:45 - beauties these are train whistles
33:50 - handmade i believe in vermont i found a
33:52 - nice little wood shop
33:53 - that makes them they've been shipped all
33:57 - the way to oregon
33:58 - is that how you say it i always get it
33:59 - wrong uh where
34:02 - uh coding train uh illustrator designer
34:05 - extraordinaire
34:06 - jason is working with a laser etcher and
34:09 - i i aspire to be able to have this set
34:11 - up for myself to do as well
34:13 - laser etching the coding train logo onto
34:15 - one side
34:17 - now what's going to go on the other side
34:20 - you might ask
34:23 - um
34:23 - [Music]
34:26 - well this so this was a uh this is not
34:29 - this is a speculative version
34:31 - of getting your own
34:34 - then the random walk pattern that is
34:36 - generated
34:37 - can then be rendered and etched onto the
34:40 - train whistle and
34:41 - shipped to you so at the moment i'm
34:44 - starting with i mean i would love
34:46 - everybody in the world to be able to
34:48 - have one of these if they so choose
34:50 - i'm starting with the sort of conductor
34:52 - level of the youtube memberships
34:54 - uh because it's about matching the sort
34:56 - of cost
34:57 - and time of doing this and then
34:59 - hopefully i'll be able to as
35:00 - after that after i get through that
35:02 - we'll see if i can start offering it to
35:04 - the passengers or
35:05 - or other folks in other ways little
35:08 - presents
35:10 - to go onto my train
35:14 - take a train tour around the world and
35:16 - hand them out
35:17 - but um we're still finalizing the design
35:20 - um but ultimately i think it uh in the
35:22 - end i think i'm going with
35:23 - offering more space on the whistle for
35:26 - the random walk pattern
35:27 - and then the index of to where the
35:29 - random number started
35:31 - as well as the number itself will then
35:33 - be etched there
35:35 - so um this is pretty much all i have to
35:38 - say
35:39 - about this the set command takes a
35:41 - number optionally supporters can use it
35:43 - as set
35:44 - number to pick their number
35:47 - right so but what if i do this
35:51 - am i just not uh maybe i'm not
35:54 - actually a supporter so it's not letting
35:56 - me do it
35:58 - because it's giving me a different
35:59 - random number but to me i think we need
36:01 - to also
36:02 - always offer the number and the index
36:06 - and because the index
36:09 - is really what is driving the unique
36:12 - pattern that the random walk is
36:13 - generating
36:16 - is there anything more for me to say
36:18 - about this play around with this
36:20 - uh post your questions but um
36:23 - it's 10 35 here i am going to
36:28 - look now at the feature of reading and
36:31 - set reading
36:34 - i looked back in time for you shiffman
36:37 - last
36:38 - read the book at page eight oh wait a
36:40 - second
36:46 - welcome mark boots
36:49 - you are the very first passenger to
36:52 - board the code i mean you're all
36:53 - passengers but the
36:55 - you know green highlighted bar in the
36:57 - chat that says passenger welcome to
36:59 - passengers
37:00 - you are the very first one to join with
37:02 - the new system
37:04 - of the bot random numbers and while i
37:06 - could
37:09 - open up my book and find a random number
37:11 - for you
37:13 - let's try out a new
37:17 - um a new
37:21 - uh feature which is
37:26 - random number so now
37:30 - sound effects are all on the wrong page
37:34 - we will now get mark boots
37:39 - random number
37:50 - [Music]
37:53 - [Laughter]
37:56 - did i spell it wrong
37:58 - [Laughter]
38:00 - uh okay
38:04 - uh oh turns out it's called random okay
38:08 - try it again here we go
38:11 - what is this emoji that someone keeps
38:14 - reacting with
38:16 - i fortunately i can't see it but i have
38:18 - a feeling it's
38:19 - something i don't want to see
38:24 - [Music]
38:27 - all right so this is now
38:30 - mark boots now now mark boots
38:34 - if you're not currently in the discord
38:37 - uh i can't actually
38:39 - set and assign this for you right now
38:40 - but please join the discord
38:43 - uh and uh be in touch come into the
38:46 - supportive channels we'll get it all
38:47 - figured out
38:48 - okay so back to
38:52 - back to um
38:55 - reading
38:59 - last read from the book at page 18
39:02 - row six and column one
39:10 - um the emojis are really distracting
39:13 - i totally agree uh um
39:17 - what am i set uh i need help again
39:20 - because i can't i have no
39:21 - my memory does not uh uh set reading
39:24 - okay set reading zero let's see if this
39:27 - works we're starting over people
39:29 - we're starting over
39:35 - please provide a valid page row and
39:38 - column
39:39 - okay i want well
39:42 - i want to be on page
39:54 - the first page of all the random digits
39:57 - is page one
39:58 - the row is zero and the column is zero
40:01 - okay so let's see if this works
40:05 - set reading page one
40:09 - row column aha
40:13 - you have updated the book position to
40:17 - one that should say page one another
40:18 - little live bug report
40:21 - uh row zero and column zero and now
40:24 - we begin
40:27 - for the fourth or fifth time
40:31 - the ceremonial coding train
40:34 - reading of the random numbers
40:38 - i'm just gonna do one row just to ease
40:41 - my way into this
40:44 - one row
40:54 - one zero zero nine seven three
40:57 - two five three three seven six
41:00 - five two zero one three five
41:03 - eight six three four six seven three
41:07 - five four eight seven six eight zero
41:10 - nine
41:11 - five nine zero nine one one seven
41:14 - three nine two nine two seven
41:18 - four nine four five
41:25 - all right
41:30 - i am verklempt now
41:34 - set reading page one
41:39 - row one column zero
41:46 - all right we're good so next time when i
41:49 - am streaming
41:50 - i can just say reading and it will tell
41:52 - me i last read the book
41:53 - at page one row one and column zero so
41:56 - um it's interesting you wanna think
41:59 - about the language here i mean this is a
42:01 - little bit of just semantics here but
42:03 - um this is technically speaking the
42:07 - starting position for the next random
42:09 - number to read
42:10 - so the last read was the end of
42:15 - page one row one column
42:18 - you know whatever and are the columns
42:21 - right there 50 are there 50 columns or
42:24 - are there 10 because we still sometimes
42:25 - think of them in groups of five
42:27 - which might seem arbitrary to you but
42:29 - just to be clear
42:30 - it's not completely arbitrary because
42:32 - this book if i hold it up
42:34 - to the camera
42:37 - and if it would focus on it the numbers
42:40 - are organized in groups of five
42:42 - so that that does have actual meaning
42:45 - the question is would i ever
42:46 - stop reading mid group of five i think i
42:49 - could live with the constraint of
42:51 - not but technically speaking what are
42:54 - the columns oh so much to think about
42:55 - how are we gonna get this right
43:00 - all right um
43:06 - i can't believe this live stream has
43:08 - been 40 minutes
43:09 - uh of of me talking about the random
43:12 - number book
43:14 - i do by the way have a mug with geometry
43:17 - formulas on him
43:19 - is it lovely
43:24 - it's getting quite warm up here where i
43:25 - am you know what it's time for
43:32 - it that's right it's
43:36 - time for community contributions
43:40 - that's right it's the time where i
43:43 - the person live streaming looks at my
43:46 - computer and pulls up things that you
43:48 - the viewers in the coding training have
43:49 - made
43:50 - in response to various videos and
43:52 - examples and things
43:53 - and features them on the stream and
43:55 - mostly just
43:56 - has a big smile and cheers and loves
43:58 - that stuff but
44:04 - what's that
44:08 - breaking news
44:12 - a community contribution came in across
44:15 - my twitter desk
44:16 - just this morning and i'm going to
44:20 - try to find it right now
44:24 - um here it is
44:29 - um let me see if i can zoom into this
44:31 - here for a second
44:33 - this is from and i have permission to
44:35 - share this
44:37 - this is from dhruv jamulia who one hour
44:40 - ago
44:40 - wrote just made an a.i that learns to
44:44 - play
44:44 - tetris using genetic algorithms and
44:47 - p5.js
44:48 - so in a moment i'm going to click on the
44:49 - web application you can see the github
44:51 - there and then
44:52 - there it is thank you i mentioned
44:55 - a huge shout out to shiffman yeah yeah
44:58 - uh
44:59 - just a medium sized a small shout out
45:01 - perfectly fine
45:02 - no need for any huge shout outs whose
45:04 - videos on genetic algorithms inspired me
45:06 - to make this when i clicked on the link
45:07 - my jaw dropped to the floor
45:09 - and i thought wow this is really if i
45:11 - just didn't waste hours without talking
45:13 - about random numbers
45:14 - in my live streams maybe i would have
45:16 - actually built this project because this
45:17 - is on my list
45:19 - um and so dhruv i don't know how you
45:20 - feel about this since you've already
45:21 - made it but on my i would like to uh
45:24 - do a bunch of videos about both coding
45:26 - uh tetris
45:27 - and as well as building an ai with
45:29 - genetic algorithms and neural networks
45:30 - to play it
45:31 - but let's take a look at it i'm going to
45:35 - click over to the webpage
45:39 - and close out the tweet and come back
45:43 - here okay
45:43 - so tetris ai artificial intelligence
45:46 - learning to play the world's most
45:48 - influential
45:49 - puzzle game i'm going to go to the
45:52 - classic
45:53 - we can look at i encourage you to look
45:54 - at the about this is the link if
45:56 - anyone's looking for it tetris
45:58 - ai.netwifi.app
46:00 - um and let's do classic okay
46:03 - now uh so i believe you know i didn't
46:06 - make this to be clear this is a
46:08 - community contribution
46:12 - and you know that because of the music
46:15 - i'm playing
46:18 - uh let's hit start
46:20 - [Music]
46:21 - so what it looks like to me and i'm
46:23 - totally speculating here
46:24 - is that it is just randomly
46:28 - playing this tetris game so randomly
46:30 - moving things left and right
46:31 - randomly rotating them and uh it's tried
46:35 - twice this is very similar to the flappy
46:37 - bird um
46:39 - examples that i've made it's tried it
46:42 - twice four times and each time
46:45 - it's keeping track of what score it got
46:49 - now i'm guessing that whatever mechanism
46:52 - is making the choices
46:53 - uh whatever system of rules you know i
46:55 - can only assume if i were doing this i
46:57 - would probably use my
46:59 - uh neural evolution technique so there's
47:01 - like a neural network that's
47:03 - taking the configuration of the tetris
47:05 - board as its input
47:06 - and then the output is some action like
47:09 - left
47:10 - right left right drop rotate left right
47:13 - i'm not sure whatever the options in
47:14 - tetris are
47:16 - and then whichever ones score the
47:17 - highest after a certain number of times
47:19 - or recombine to make new ones and i'm
47:22 - going to hit increase speed
47:24 - which is one of my uh and we can see it
47:26 - doing a lot more and so i can only
47:28 - assume that after some amount of time i
47:29 - don't know
47:30 - how long we would have to wait um
47:34 - we would get one that plays fairly well
47:37 - so
47:37 - one thing that i think is good to do if
47:39 - i can if you'll humor me
47:41 - uh with a little um feedback here is
47:44 - uh if after this has been run for a
47:47 - while
47:47 - to be able to save the state you could
47:50 - use
47:50 - even local storage for that or perhaps
47:53 - just save the current
47:55 - like configuration of the high scorer
47:57 - might be an excellent thing that you
47:59 - could load back and that's something
48:00 - that
48:01 - i think that i did with my um flappy
48:04 - bird
48:05 - um examples
48:08 - um and kake in the chat is saying hey i
48:10 - made this project a while ago
48:12 - using deep q learning so deep cue
48:15 - learning is one of my
48:17 - uh i don't know is it white whales is it
48:20 - my
48:20 - windmill that i'm always trying to
48:22 - defeat i don't know what
48:24 - cultural historical uh reference point i
48:27 - should be using here
48:28 - um but i really i i don't it's deep cue
48:31 - learning and q learning is a topic that
48:33 - i have really been hoping to explore and
48:35 - cover
48:36 - and hopefully someday i can get to it
48:38 - and chris writes
48:39 - this feels like the 2021 version of war
48:42 - games
48:44 - great movie by the way i watched ferris
48:46 - bueller with my family recently that was
48:47 - a lot of fun
48:48 - uh okay so let's see um
48:52 - i'm almost halfway through my time and i
48:54 - want to get to some of the coding
48:56 - projects
48:57 - i'm planning to do i also need to take a
49:00 - break
49:01 - and tell you about the brilliant the
49:02 - sponsor of today's live stream
49:05 - um but let's look at let's let me um let
49:08 - me
49:08 - let me constrain myself to looking at
49:11 - two community contributions and the way
49:13 - that i'm going to do that i know we have
49:15 - the wonderful wheel
49:16 - spinner but i'm going to just try seeing
49:19 - today
49:20 - and thank you so much for sharing this
49:23 - on twitter
49:24 - with me i would like to
49:27 - um can close this i'm going to go to the
49:30 - coding train website i'm going to go to
49:31 - the coding challenges
49:33 - and there are currently uh 161 of them
49:37 - so let's go back to discord
49:40 - and uh say random
49:44 - can i give it a range i can't remember
49:46 - if i can give it a range
49:48 - i got a number uh one
49:51 - three seven two one so if i were to just
49:55 - do it uh
49:56 - modulus 161
49:59 - will google do that for me uh 44 oh
50:02 - modulo
50:02 - badger low modulo modulo
50:07 - is the operator modulus is the result of
50:09 - the operation
50:10 - 44. so now we're going to go to coding
50:13 - challenge
50:14 - number 44 it's an oldie
50:19 - um and oh it's a
50:22 - multi-part one oh a fin 111
50:26 - this one's going to be a little wonky
50:28 - i'm actually going to be really
50:29 - surprised if this one has
50:30 - any community contributions uh let's
50:33 - take a look
50:34 - at uh part two
50:38 - and ah there are there are
50:41 - three community contributions well two
50:43 - are by the same person that's no that's
50:45 - uh it still counts as three
50:47 - um and one is called feeling emoji
50:50 - and all ooh i love that title feeling
50:52 - emojian emojianal
50:54 - um mckay is also asking do you think
50:57 - we'll
50:57 - explore ray tracing i would like to i
51:00 - would like to
51:01 - um so let's take a look at a
51:03 - sentiment.js
51:06 - this is i don't know what this is hello
51:09 - okay um i am dan
51:13 - oh okay the coding train
51:16 - is live
51:23 - and happy ah okay
51:26 - so this looks like uh so if i remember
51:29 - correctly
51:30 - what this particular coding challenge
51:32 - demonstrates
51:33 - is a methodology for doing sentiment
51:36 - analysis on a text
51:37 - which uses a pre sort of hard-coded
51:41 - list of words with assigned sentiment
51:43 - scores that were put together if my
51:45 - memory serves me
51:46 - correctly by a group of psychologists
51:49 - um who created this list it's a
51:51 - well-known list
51:52 - called the a-fin 111 and so i
51:56 - presumably what this is is a nice little
51:58 - interface for typing in a sentence
51:59 - and the reason why i might get a score
52:02 - of
52:04 - zero is none of these words the coding
52:06 - train or in the list
52:08 - but if i say happy jovial um
52:12 - sunny day and i got a score of 2.5 maybe
52:16 - it's like an
52:16 - average of the scores of all those words
52:19 - um
52:20 - sad depressed
52:24 - gray day negative 1.67 so you can see
52:27 - you know this is not a a very
52:29 - sophisticated method
52:31 - but it is a mechanism for taking any
52:34 - arbitrary sequence of words and turning
52:37 - it into a numeric score
52:39 - so you can go back and watch that coding
52:41 - challenge thank you for this new
52:42 - interface
52:43 - sam lee and now here's a colorized
52:46 - sentiment score
52:47 - also by sam lee um which ah whoa
52:52 - um i don't know what to do paste text
52:56 - here
52:57 - um happy sunny jovial day
53:04 - do i press this button now and i get the
53:07 - score
53:08 - and oh and look at that it is
53:11 - highlighting the words
53:13 - with probably a sort of brightness level
53:15 - according to what score it got so
53:18 - like for example um let's just go to
53:20 - rainbow
53:21 - on wikipedia and let's
53:25 - copy paste like this text
53:29 - bring it in here press this button
53:32 - wow not a single word
53:36 - is in the aphin 111 dataset that's kind
53:39 - of nuts
53:40 - um interestingly enough it would be it
53:42 - would be interesting to compare this to
53:45 - um
53:51 - uh where's oh sorry learn.mo5js.org
53:54 - to what is in the um
53:58 - the sentiment analysis model in
54:03 - the ml5.js library so this is a
54:06 - particular
54:07 - module in the ml5 library that uses a
54:09 - neural network
54:10 - to take text as an input and output a
54:13 - sentiment score
54:14 - and this particular pre-trained model
54:16 - that's offered with ml5
54:18 - was trained off of movie reviews so i
54:20 - think we could have a very long
54:22 - thorough discussion as to you know what
54:25 - uh what sort of biases and sort of are
54:28 - inherent in using
54:30 - movie reviews as your training set but
54:32 - you need some training data set that has
54:34 - chunks of text with labeled with a
54:37 - sentiment score
54:38 - and so presumably a movie review that's
54:40 - been assigned a score like our star
54:42 - rating
54:43 - that's how you can collect a data set
54:45 - like that without having to manually
54:46 - curate one
54:47 - so i think if i um go here to let's try
54:52 - going to
54:53 - this uh example i hope this works
54:57 - um and let me just change
55:01 - this here so this example uses the movie
55:05 - review
55:06 - model and it scores the sentiment of a
55:08 - text with a value between 0
55:10 - and 1 0 being negative 1 being positive
55:13 - [Music]
55:14 - movie reviews were truncated to a
55:16 - maximum of 200 words and only the most
55:17 - 20 000 most common words in the room
55:19 - so this is very similar but instead of
55:22 - being a sort of
55:23 - hard-coded curated list of words that
55:26 - a sort of so-called trained expert i
55:28 - don't mean that they aren't experts i
55:30 - just think it's like you know
55:31 - who are those people and are why are we
55:34 - entrusting them to
55:35 - assign sentiment scores to language i
55:38 - think that's
55:39 - a complex question uh what's the
55:41 - difference between doing that
55:43 - trust having an expert created list of
55:45 - words versus an
55:46 - automated list of words essentially
55:48 - generated from a neural network based
55:50 - system
55:50 - so let's go um well let's just sort of
55:53 - see
55:54 - you can see we get today is the happiest
55:56 - day and it's full of rainbows
55:57 - is a very high number
56:01 - saddest day and is full of uh
56:04 - [Music]
56:05 - rain storms
56:08 - and clouds
56:14 - uh
56:18 - sad and miserable
56:22 - does that not work cause i got got a
56:24 - very high sentiment score
56:28 - yeah um well i got a different score
56:32 - and let's see if we can make it be
56:34 - negative this is weird something's up
56:35 - something is definitely a miss here
56:39 - um miserable sad annoyed i hate
56:46 - everything and i'm so gosh darned
56:49 - tired angst analysis demo there we go
56:57 - what's it i just curious yeah all right
57:00 - so i'm not sure
57:01 - um
57:05 - yeah i'm not sure what happened there
57:06 - before but we can see that you know with
57:08 - me trying to write
57:10 - very extreme uh sort of sentences that
57:14 - uh in my mind are
57:15 - clearly uh negative
57:18 - versus positive um i'm able to sort of
57:21 - produce some results
57:22 - um this is a very small text box
57:25 - but i'm just curious to see if i can
57:28 - paste
57:28 - this in here and hit submit
57:32 - the rainbow wikipedia page is full
57:35 - of happy positive uh energy and
57:38 - sentiment
57:40 - all right uh we've got one more uh here
57:44 - to uh demonstrate feeling emojinol by
57:47 - chris
57:48 - hall let's take a look at this um
57:51 - and how are you i am
57:55 - okay today it's been
57:58 - a hard year but
58:02 - things are looking up and
58:05 - i'm excited for this summer
58:09 - so this is pretty cool i mean i i like
58:11 - what this is doing
58:14 - um it's looking at my text
58:17 - it's showing me which words have which
58:19 - sentiment score so we can see i'm
58:21 - getting a total
58:22 - of two hard we had a negative score
58:25 - excited had a
58:26 - high positive score and then i guess
58:27 - it's summarizing it
58:30 - uh in with an emoji as well as with kind
58:33 - of some
58:34 - uh text i don't know of how that text is
58:36 - generated picked from a list
58:37 - i don't know if it can only ever be a
58:39 - happy or sad emoji um but i like this
58:42 - idea of almost like a free writing
58:43 - exercise
58:44 - and in real time as you're free writing
58:47 - um you're getting this
58:48 - um feedback on the the web page itself
58:51 - is changing
58:52 - i could imagine doing something that's
58:54 - more abs that's kind of abstract
58:56 - in this vein as you're typing an email
58:58 - even like this would be like a chrome
58:59 - extension you're typing an email in the
59:01 - sort of color scheme of your email
59:03 - editor
59:04 - uh is a browser extension i should say
59:07 - uh is um
59:08 - is changing or could you have something
59:09 - that's like reading the sentiment of
59:11 - your code like code comments
59:13 - that would be kind of interesting um so
59:16 - um so this is great thank you guys see
59:18 - this is this is uh this is bringing me
59:20 - so much happiness today
59:22 - because uh i just love to see the sort
59:24 - of creative possibilities
59:25 - that come out of of many of these
59:27 - examples ah all right hold on
59:30 - a in the chat says i just discovered
59:34 - this channel
59:35 - i am excited but where do i get started
59:38 - well
59:38 - lucky for you i caught your message in
59:40 - the chat and i am here to answer it
59:42 - so um back to the coding train website
59:46 - if coding is brand new to you and you
59:48 - want to explore it through this channel
59:51 - you know to be clear there are many
59:53 - other pathways and possibilities and
59:55 - places
59:56 - for you to explore coding um
60:00 - but um through this channel
60:03 - this particular beginners sorry
60:06 - these playlists are meant for beginners
60:09 - with no experience whatsoever
60:11 - um the p5.js one is probably the most
60:15 - up-to-date one and in fact you can sort
60:19 - of see
60:20 - i'm slowly filling in the gaps of
60:22 - replacing older videos
60:24 - so this is a beginner playlist that i
60:26 - would like to
60:27 - always have available and kind of
60:29 - current and you can see that there are
60:32 - some videos that were made in 2015
60:35 - that are still in this playlist the code
60:37 - for all these videos
60:38 - still works i also look a little bit
60:41 - younger i think my brain is working
60:43 - better
60:43 - as i age you know this different things
60:46 - seem harder for me to
60:47 - figure out but uh so you know i think
60:50 - there's hopefully there's still value in
60:51 - these older videos but um
60:53 - you know i've been able to improve the
60:54 - examples for clarity based on feedback
60:57 - as well as improve some of the
60:58 - production value
60:59 - of the videos so you can see that these
61:01 - are recent ones that are newer that just
61:03 - um you know from uh from february march
61:06 - of this year
61:07 - so next on my list you know it's always
61:10 - this balance of how much do i want to do
61:12 - live streaming
61:13 - versus uh work on the nature of code
61:15 - book or versus work on updating these
61:17 - videos
61:18 - so but i would like by the fall to
61:21 - finish replacing
61:23 - all the way up until i think these um
61:27 - boy a lot any of that were made in 2015
61:30 - so i think the 2017 ones i'll probably
61:32 - keep
61:33 - still but all the 2015 ones i would like
61:36 - to replace
61:37 - by the way if you have feedback i don't
61:38 - know what people think of the new sort
61:40 - of thumbnails
61:41 - um and the new style of the videos but
61:44 - um
61:44 - but yeah so that's where
61:48 - um um that's where you can begin
61:54 - i'm seeing people in the chat requesting
61:56 - to show different contributions and
61:58 - but um i think right now um as it is 11
62:01 - a.m
62:02 - the exact is perfect i spent an hour
62:04 - this is this is how it should be
62:06 - i spent an hour you know it should
62:08 - really be 50 minutes or 55 minutes
62:10 - because i'm gonna take a five minute
62:11 - break
62:14 - i yeah the processing ones are really
62:17 - old
62:18 - um yeah
62:22 - i spent about an hour kind of meandering
62:25 - through
62:26 - showing some contributions talking about
62:27 - the discord bot um i want to work on
62:30 - in the second half of the live stream i
62:33 - want to work
62:34 - on um
62:40 - self 3d self-avoiding walk and and
62:42 - looking at uh bezier curves
62:44 - um so i'm going to take a short break
62:46 - before i take a break
62:48 - i would like to thank uh today's sponsor
62:50 - uh the coding train the engine is kept
62:52 - running by the sponsors of the go to
62:54 - drain
62:54 - built this thing up that has a lot of
62:56 - components and a lot of pieces
62:58 - and i'm really thankful to have uh
63:01 - partners oh and
63:02 - ahmer super chat is coming in this also
63:04 - helps keep the engine running
63:06 - uh uh have friends from the different
63:09 - sponsors who are able to support the
63:10 - work that i'm doing
63:11 - um if you like learning stuff on the
63:13 - coding train
63:15 - if you also like having mugs i just
63:17 - switch over here to this view
63:19 - with uh geometry formulas on them this
63:21 - is one side of my mug
63:23 - you know you know what's better than
63:25 - learning some geometry formulas from
63:26 - your
63:27 - mug of tea or coffee or warm water with
63:30 - lemon
63:30 - as my grandmother used to like to make
63:33 - um i think it was called
63:35 - uh yiddish it's like vasa mcmillan
63:38 - anybody who knows yiddish what does that
63:39 - mean is that like with milk in it i'm
63:41 - not sure it's like these things are
63:42 - popping into my mind
63:44 - um but brilliant is really um
63:48 - a website and uh app that i think you
63:51 - will
63:51 - um particularly particularly love it has
63:55 - um so what do i do i talk ramble
63:58 - incessantly um and demonstrate stuff but
64:01 - really
64:02 - for me the way that i learn most
64:03 - effectively is through trying things on
64:05 - my own
64:06 - and so brilliant is really a website
64:07 - that's all about uh and
64:09 - an app all about trying things on uh for
64:12 - your own interactive courses
64:13 - daily challenges um and just the the
64:16 - topics like if i go to the courses page
64:19 - um you know this is like i just go ah
64:21 - well i just want to gobble it all up
64:23 - because it's all of the topics
64:24 - that i really love it's got stuff for
64:26 - all ages um
64:27 - you know two courses that i would like
64:29 - to highlight for you
64:30 - one is the um
64:35 - fundam program with python course so i i
64:38 - like to highlight this one because i
64:40 - um program with javascript and a lot of
64:43 - get a lot of requests about learning
64:44 - python
64:45 - and this would be a great one to explore
64:48 - the basics of programming with a
64:49 - different language for you
64:51 - this course called geometry fundamentals
64:53 - has some really amazing uh
64:55 - visual animations um that demonstrate
64:58 - core concepts in
64:59 - in math and geometry honestly one of the
65:02 - reasons why i love it so much
65:04 - is my mic still working it's like
65:06 - disappeared from my screen it is um one
65:08 - of the reasons why i love this course so
65:09 - much is that
65:10 - um it gives me a lot of ideas of like
65:12 - visual things that i want to make
65:14 - um coming back to uh here um like this
65:18 - beautiful geometry course
65:20 - um i'm uh it's just like really amazing
65:22 - i'm gonna hit continue
65:24 - um and you can see here i'm in lesson
65:26 - two uh i got this one right i guess
65:29 - at some point i'm gonna go on next well
65:31 - i'm a little bit afraid so
65:32 - the end the answer to the prior problem
65:34 - we found that a progressive series
65:36 - of similar l shapes each with a red
65:37 - portion of one third and use that
65:39 - to derive the fact that the entire large
65:41 - square has a red portion of one third
65:43 - it's kind of like these infinite series
65:45 - are super interesting
65:46 - another approach is take each red square
65:49 - and make two
65:50 - copies one to the right of the square
65:52 - being copied and one to the one below
65:54 - so this shows that in purple oh
65:58 - interesting and this method of covering
66:00 - the overall large square leads to two
66:02 - purple squares for every one red square
66:05 - this again moment of realization this
66:08 - leads to the red area being one third of
66:10 - the overall square
66:12 - um so you can go through and uh it's
66:14 - going to give me oh no
66:15 - no i gotta work on this one now okay
66:19 - uh so like at your your instinct would
66:23 - be like
66:23 - three-fourths right because
66:26 - one two three and then
66:29 - the blue circle you know there's four
66:31 - sections but this blue
66:33 - circle has a yellow one let's think
66:36 - about this
66:39 - are we at four
66:43 - so it's more than three three-fourths
66:46 - right so we can eliminate three-fifths
66:49 - which is less than three-fourths i kind
66:51 - of want to do that purple thing
66:53 - how did that purple thing go where for
66:56 - every red square we put two blue squares
67:01 - so for every
67:05 - but there's no for every oh each one of
67:07 - these is
67:09 - four so for every four
67:13 - 8 12 yellow squares
67:17 - i can color three blue squares
67:24 - so 12 out of 15
67:27 - which is four-fifths did i get that
67:31 - right
67:33 - i got it right oh my god
67:37 - oh that was so exciting oh wait wait
67:39 - wait i don't want to go back
67:41 - go back um what i love about this is
67:43 - then i go to the show explanation
67:46 - and um yeah it did this is what i did in
67:49 - my head
67:50 - uh 12 and then three um
67:53 - awesome which reduces to four fifths oh
67:55 - this is so fun
67:56 - so um if you are interested in this

68:17 - 20 off okay um i
68:20 - am going to now um so thank you again to
68:23 - brilliant
68:24 - um i am going to take a short uh
68:26 - hopefully just like two or three minute
68:28 - break
68:28 - just to grab some water uh do a 30
68:31 - second meditation
68:33 - and come back to look at something
68:35 - called a self-avoiding walk
68:37 - and extending that into 3d and hopefully
68:40 - by next week the actual it's about a
68:42 - 35 to 40 minute coding challenge video
68:44 - building
68:45 - the entire self-avoiding walk okay uh
68:48 - see you all in about
68:49 - two or three minutes
68:55 - and i'm muting my microphone here i'll
68:57 - be right back
69:07 - [Music]
69:20 - [Music]
69:46 - so
69:54 - [Music]
70:05 - [Music]
70:28 - do
70:35 - [Music]
70:42 - so
70:46 - [Music]
71:02 - [Applause]
71:04 - [Music]
71:24 - do
71:31 - [Music]
71:50 - all right i am back um i see folks in
71:54 - the uh
71:55 - chat are asking a very common frequently
71:57 - asked question which is what is the
71:59 - music that i'm playing
72:00 - uh this is a song it's called tori the
72:03 - dog
72:04 - i have no idea why it's called that is
72:06 - by a composer named adam blau
72:08 - who is a film and tv uh composer based
72:12 - in
72:12 - los angeles i think you can find um him
72:15 - on twitter
72:16 - um adam blau i think he has a website
72:18 - adam blough.com
72:20 - adam blau is a friend of mine from my
72:22 - old bright college
72:24 - years okay thank uh
72:28 - offered up this uh track that he had
72:30 - written that doesn't get used anywhere
72:31 - else for me to use
72:33 - um all right so what's happening now
72:35 - we're actually going to do
72:36 - some coding uh thanks again to the
72:38 - sponsor of today brilliant
72:40 - um so what are you looking at here this
72:43 - is
72:44 - remember i spent all this time talking
72:46 - about random walks
72:47 - and the uh new coding train discord bot
72:50 - earlier
72:52 - and the next coding challenge that will
72:54 - be released on the channel is
72:55 - programming exactly this
72:57 - and i know this is a little bit
72:58 - unfortunate the way things are working
73:00 - for me these days where i'm covering
73:02 - additional things from the
73:05 - uh coding challenge on a live stream
73:08 - when the coding challenge hasn't yet
73:09 - been released but
73:11 - that's the way it works right now um so
73:14 - this is the code
73:15 - that the challenge ends now what what
73:17 - you can see about what's different about
73:19 - a self-avoiding walk
73:20 - is it's making a random decision every
73:22 - frame to move up down left or right
73:25 - but it's never allowed to step into a
73:27 - position where it has been before
73:30 - so we you might be able to see this a
73:31 - bit more uh clearly
73:33 - as if i started over and you can see one
73:36 - of the things that i've built into this
73:37 - example is if it ends up somewhere where
73:39 - it is stuck
73:40 - and has nowhere to go it will backtrack
73:43 - and try a different route so this is i i
73:46 - think this is a beautiful
73:47 - um um a beautiful
73:52 - an algorithm that has beautiful results
73:54 - um i i kind of hypnotized by it i could
73:56 - kind of watch it all day
73:57 - i think there's a lot of probably this
73:59 - is just a very literal basic
74:01 - visualization of it i think there's a
74:03 - lot of possibilities of what you could
74:04 - do to explore this
74:06 - um on a live stream a while ago i think
74:08 - i did this with
74:09 - you know some curves and started to make
74:11 - these different patterns from it
74:13 - but what i uh would like to
74:16 - demonstrate in the video is
74:20 - what it looks like if it's in 3d so
74:23 - you know time box myself here maybe just
74:25 - give me myself 20 25 minutes
74:29 - to see um uh how that works now i just
74:32 - realized
74:34 - that i need a three okay so first of all
74:36 - let me duplicate i already duplicated
74:38 - this
74:39 - uh so let's say three you know what
74:42 - i wanna first see like how do i even
74:44 - render this
74:45 - in 3d so first of all if i say webgl
74:51 - great okay so that's excellent now can i
74:55 - in draw say orbit is it
74:58 - do i say orbit controls orbit control
75:04 - there's a uh oh there we go
75:08 - so there's a function in p5 look at that
75:10 - that is wild
75:11 - that is so cool so even just doing this
75:14 - and
75:14 - i think i oh and you know my font is so
75:16 - tiny sorry about that
75:21 - um let's now let's give myself a little
75:24 - bit more space
75:29 - and i can zoom in ah
75:34 - hold on
75:38 - i don't know why this orbit controls
75:40 - thing there we go it's just very
75:43 - do i not yeah it works it's just kind of
75:45 - like
75:46 - a little wonky um all right so now now
75:50 - that that works
75:52 - uh and maybe what i would like to do is
75:55 - have
75:56 - the spacing be a little bit bigger so
75:59 - that way also it's a little bigger okay
76:02 - um so i can sort of see this whoa it
76:04 - moving
76:05 - closer all right so now what i would
76:07 - like to do
76:09 - is
76:12 - change this to make
76:15 - 3d array columns rows
76:18 - what's the word for
76:22 - the in a 3d grid
76:26 - i mean columns rows i mean it's really
76:28 - just x
76:30 - the three different axes
76:34 - uh i i was to say like zoll's
76:44 - i wanted to make a um
76:47 - zowls okay columns rows
76:50 - and i'm officially calling them zowls
76:53 - [Laughter]
76:55 - uh layers depths depth i realize it's
76:58 - depth but okay i'm fine
77:00 - uh not we'll call it depth so
77:03 - for every column we have a certain
77:07 - number of
77:08 - rows
77:11 - and for every
77:17 - then four and this should for
77:23 - every
77:27 - element of for every
77:32 - row
77:35 - i mean this is like a crazy way to make
77:37 - a three-dimensional array in javascript
77:38 - but it's just
77:40 - the way i know how uh
77:48 - is this right i think this is right
77:52 - um we can do a nice console log table
77:55 - so we're gonna make a 3d array columns
77:59 - rows
78:00 - depth and i'm just going to say
78:04 - depth is the same as the number of
78:06 - columns
78:08 - and let's let's test this out orbit
78:11 - control
78:12 - let's test this out so i'm just opening
78:14 - up the console here
78:16 - because if i say make 3d array
78:20 - 10 10 10.
78:23 - was it not called that oh i have to run
78:27 - it
78:27 - oh unexpected token
78:30 - but we have an extra parenthesis there
78:34 - okay it's running let's go
78:37 - back to here
78:41 - okay that works so um
78:50 - three let's make it three by three by
78:52 - three
78:55 - let's just test it
78:59 - let's look at that so it's got an array
79:03 - of three arrays
79:04 - and each array of three arrays has three
79:07 - things in it
79:08 - empty times three that makes sense can i
79:11 - do like console.table
79:16 - um test
79:20 - yeah so this makes sense because it is a
79:23 - 2d array with each spot having an array
79:26 - in it
79:27 - okay so that's good
79:30 - i think the only thing okay so now what
79:33 - else do i need to change
79:36 - and can i give myself a little bit more
79:38 - room here
79:41 - i guess i shouldn't have made it uh 800
79:43 - by 800.
79:48 - let's do that and then do you know as i
79:51 - obsessively try to have the right amount
79:53 - of space here
79:54 - okay so now um we've got a 3d array
79:59 - the spot is zero zero zero
80:05 - um return is valid
80:08 - i j k everything's got to have a third
80:12 - element to it uh oh
80:17 - k k plus plus
80:21 - k is less than depth
80:24 - i j k spot i j
80:27 - k i'm just kind of let me hit
80:31 - stop here and turn auto refresh off
80:33 - please
80:34 - i just want everything that was
80:36 - previously
80:37 - in two dimensions to switch
80:40 - to being three
80:43 - all right what else do i got here is
80:46 - valid
80:47 - all right and then also
80:50 - check if k is less than zero
80:55 - k is greater than or equal to depth that
80:57 - would be off
80:58 - the grid okay translate i don't really
81:02 - need to worry about that
81:04 - spot is next spot path
81:08 - path length college uh if you've hit
81:11 - every spot uh
81:15 - spot.z spot.z
81:19 - okay now where's my spot class
81:23 - needs to have a dz
81:30 - and then all of the steps now there's a
81:33 - lot more possibilities
81:39 - for all of the possible steps that it
81:42 - could take
81:44 - wow if i did a good job writing this
81:45 - code the original code
81:47 - extending it into 3d is going to be as
81:49 - easy as what i'm doing right now
81:52 - which i don't know if that's really the
81:53 - case but we're about to find out
81:56 - okay uh i j k
82:02 - uh the z is and i realized this would
82:06 - make a lot more sense if you had all
82:07 - just watched
82:08 - the video where i built this all options
82:11 - all options
82:13 - new x
82:17 - new z
82:23 - is valid new x new y new z
82:29 - um
82:34 - okay grid uh we need the
82:37 - z component which is k plus dz
82:44 - is that really everything what's the
82:46 - chance that i did this right
82:48 - very little
82:51 - oh my goodness i think it's actually
82:53 - kind of doing it
83:00 - it seems to not be moving along the z
83:02 - very much though i mean it did
83:28 - like why why did it go why is it
83:31 - sticking within a sort of
83:32 - current plane the second dx should be
83:35 - negative one
83:41 - in the step constructor
83:49 - i think i got it right
83:54 - hold on
83:57 - it's kind of staying within one
84:00 - plane line 13. oh
84:05 - thank you
84:08 - that i couldn't see
84:15 - there we go wild
84:21 - wow that is wild
84:25 - what why did i just do that in like 10
84:28 - minutes
84:33 - i mean visually this could be vastly
84:36 - improved
84:43 - i'm trying to think if there's anything
84:44 - i could do right now just to sort of
84:46 - visually improve it
84:47 - so one thing is i feel like the line
84:51 - thickness is a very thick
84:56 - so
84:59 - um let's let's make it
85:02 - thinner and
85:06 - maybe what i want to do is actually not
85:08 - use orbit control
85:11 - but translate
85:21 - i'm putting where it starts in the
85:22 - center but it can't go
85:24 - negatively so what if i actually have it
85:26 - start
85:27 - at um
85:33 - like what's the center
85:37 - center x equals uh columns divided by
85:42 - it's the same for all of them so columns
85:45 - divided by
85:47 - uh 2 but make sure i
85:50 - floor it and then uh
85:54 - let's just reuse that so i'm gonna have
85:57 - it start in the center
86:01 - um and
86:04 - let's just make sure that works
86:11 - what did i just do
86:17 - um but now i want to translate oh whoa
86:19 - that's weird but now i don't want to
86:25 - translate it anywhere
86:29 - or no i want to translate it by negative
86:42 - i want to translate it
86:46 - you know what let me put orbit controls
86:49 - back
86:49 - in wait i i want it to
86:53 - starting in the center of the grid which
86:55 - i want
86:56 - oh no spacing times
87:00 - columns negative spacing times rows
87:04 - negative spacing times depth
87:10 - there we go this is what i want i want
87:13 - it to start
87:14 - in the center but be able to go in all
87:15 - directions
87:17 - do i have orbit control in so now there
87:19 - we go i wanted to be able to kind of
87:21 - move around it
87:24 - can you fade it darker the further away
87:26 - from the camera yeah
87:30 - are we breaking yes is this what was
87:32 - that called like the tubes
87:34 - that old uh win3 this old screensaver
87:37 - am i am i just remaking that what was it
87:39 - was it like
87:44 - is this what it was called pipes pipes
87:50 - i did not realize i just made this
87:56 - all right let's what's the so yeah i'm
88:00 - totally
88:01 - basically making this
88:05 - amazing amazing all right but uh
88:08 - i have to visually think about the
88:10 - design of this
88:12 - a bit more but i wanted to do a couple
88:14 - things
88:15 - one is what if i take out orbit controls
88:19 - and just do like rotate
88:22 - x frame count times
88:26 - 0.01 or something
88:30 - so it's always going to whoa
88:37 - that's a little bit weird and
88:40 - let's try rotating y
88:45 - more slowly okay
88:48 - okay so this
88:52 - i'm enjoying
88:57 - and what can i do is there anything i
88:59 - can do just sort of visually right now
89:04 - yeah i kind of wanted to make it thinner
89:06 - there we go
89:14 - so here we go this is what i will
89:17 - capture give each walker a i want to
89:19 - start multiple ones
89:21 - give them different colors so this is
89:23 - what um oh
89:25 - um this is what i would like i just
89:28 - this is enough for me right now i just
89:29 - wanted to be able to demonstrate
89:32 - um
89:35 - to demonstrate the core idea and so i
89:38 - have now a visual thing i can render
89:40 - for um making it in through in 3d yeah
89:45 - yep i could write i could take the
89:48 - rgb so first of all let me grab this
89:51 - code
89:53 - and i want to go to discord
89:56 - and ah random max between zero thank you
90:00 - and i'm going to go to
90:03 - links so i this is where i will
90:06 - typically paste
90:07 - links to things that i'm doing in the
90:09 - live stream somebody is welcome to paste
90:11 - this into the youtube chat i just don't
90:13 - have that open right now
90:14 - but um so that's where you can find the
90:16 - link to this code right now
90:18 - um but i think this is good enough like
90:22 - this
90:23 - this is what i want to capture that
90:26 - video this is the last piece for this
90:28 - video to come out
90:28 - any questions translate to center before
90:32 - rotating so it stays in perspective
90:34 - so in theory it's it is translated
90:38 - to the center of
90:42 - this particular
90:49 - kind of cube that it is going to try to
90:51 - fill
90:52 - um based on this translation
90:58 - but i believe that it is appears that
91:00 - it's not staying in our perspective
91:03 - because it randomly chose to go in one
91:06 - direction at the beginning
91:07 - and never came back to go the other way
91:10 - so
91:10 - i could dynamically translate to
91:14 - like do something interesting of like
91:16 - where it currently is
91:18 - like this would be a little bit crazy
91:20 - like what if i said
91:22 - um translate
91:26 - to um negative spot dot x
91:31 - negative spot dot y negative spot dot z
91:35 - like i think this would make it i mean
91:38 - it's it's very jarring but it's
91:40 - following
91:40 - the current spot whoa
91:44 - i could okay wait i got i got it now i
91:46 - can't
91:47 - uh let lerp x lerp
91:50 - y lerp z
91:54 - um how do i have them all equal zero is
91:57 - there a way to declare
91:58 - three variables all at once where they
91:59 - all equal zero
92:02 - that's not just this
92:05 - uh
92:10 - okay um
92:14 - so what i want to do is say lerpx equals
92:18 - lerp
92:19 - lerp lerp x spot
92:23 - dot x ooh stallion that's way too
92:25 - jarring for me
92:26 - um so if i want to move towards the spot
92:30 - i want to go just like a small
92:32 - percentage of the way there
92:33 - so let's say 0.1 let's call that amount
92:40 - and let's do that for y
92:44 - z
92:49 - and then negative lerp x
92:52 - lerp y lerp z this should now
92:55 - more smoothly follow it oops negative
93:00 - and one more negative let's see if this
93:06 - works
93:11 - right you can see that it's a bit more
93:12 - smooth let's make the amount
93:14 - like really literally less
93:18 - there we go it's kind of cool so it's
93:21 - like an automated sort of
93:22 - camera that's trying to
93:26 - why is it moving further away though it
93:29 - should be
93:29 - staying close to it
93:34 - maybe that's just the lurping is slow
93:43 - it's kind of interesting though i mean i
93:45 - don't know
93:46 - if i like what happens if i take the
93:47 - rotate out
93:56 - very strange so there's probably
94:02 - there's there's probably a uh
94:05 - a different way to do this that would be
94:08 - uh interesting in terms of following the
94:10 - camera but this is kind of a quick
94:13 - demonstration that i have right now i
94:14 - kind of love it actually
94:18 - but i want to look at bezier curves
94:26 - the rotation is around the wrong anchor
94:28 - point i know right
94:30 - well i'm not rotating now
94:34 - um
94:42 - but now i am
94:46 - what if i do rotate z
94:50 - so it's just kind of spinning
94:55 - move the rotate above the translator all
94:57 - right all right
95:12 - yeah focus on the center work out the
95:14 - center from the minimum x to the minimum
95:16 - y yeah there's so many ways that this
95:18 - could be done
95:19 - but focusing on the center would be a
95:21 - very good idea
95:22 - uh capture the maximum x y and z and
95:25 - center on their midpoints i'm going to
95:27 - leave that as an exercise
95:28 - to the viewer although i kind of to be
95:31 - honest
95:33 - that actually okay can i allow myself
95:35 - five more minutes to do that
95:42 - let's use p5 vector
95:48 - um so i need
95:59 - min x min xyz
96:09 - max xyz so
96:12 - for let v of path
96:16 - and then i would say min x y z
96:19 - equals um
96:21 - [Music]
96:23 - or spot of path like oh no let
96:26 - but yeah i'll just say v it's fine min x
96:29 - y z
96:30 - equals the minimum whichever one is
96:33 - smaller of
96:34 - v dot x and itself
96:39 - minx y z dot x
96:44 - min x y z dot y min
96:47 - x y z dot z so this is getting the
96:50 - minimum
96:51 - xyz
96:55 - then the maximum
97:00 - should be the max function
97:04 - whichever one is bigger
97:07 - between the x the y the z and the max
97:14 - then center dot
97:18 - x equals
97:21 - min x y z i kind of want to just call
97:25 - these min v
97:26 - no but it's not really that because min
97:29 - x y z of
97:31 - max x y z dot x
97:36 - minus min x y z dot x
97:44 - times zero half of that plus the minimum
97:50 - is that right center dot x
97:54 - is the maximum minus the minimum that's
97:57 - the
97:58 - the range half of the range offset from
98:00 - the minimum
98:04 - y z
98:08 - y z y z
98:12 - y z oh wait a sec
98:16 - the maximum the minimum can't be zero
98:19 - it'll always be zero
98:23 - so the minimum has to start at like
98:28 - infinity
98:30 - um and it's the minimum oh dot x
98:34 - dot y dot z dot x
98:39 - dot y dot z
98:42 - and now what happens if let's get rid of
98:45 - the rotation
98:46 - what if i do translate negative center x
98:51 - negative center y negative center z
98:56 - and i might want to lerp those but hold
98:58 - on
99:00 - missing parentheses oops here
99:11 - yeah look at that that is wild
99:24 - okay let's put the alert back in this is
99:26 - this is really cool
99:28 - uh let's put the alert back in
99:32 - uh where is that lerp lerp lerp
99:35 - so this should be center dot x no no
99:38 - center dot x center dot y center dot z
99:45 - and let's yeah that's fine and then
99:49 - uh lerp
99:52 - x lerp y
99:57 - lerp z okay here we go everybody
100:11 - so it's interesting i i was i would have
100:13 - might be done the average location but i
100:15 - like this minimum and maximum because
100:16 - it's sort of like
100:17 - panning now the question is should i add
100:21 - some rotation
100:25 - like is that interesting
100:28 - to also see it rotate
100:32 - i feel like i would like to see it
100:33 - rotate around the y axis
100:35 - is kind of what i'm expecting to see
100:47 - it's why is it rotate away the rotation
100:53 - am i just wrong about the way that i'm
100:55 - thinking about this and the rotation
100:57 - really should be before the translation
101:00 - maybe yeah this is what i meant
101:04 - to do i don't understand why the
101:06 - rotation should be before that's like
101:08 - backwards the way i think about it
101:11 - but this is great if i don't say so
101:14 - myself
101:17 - uh
101:22 - um let me see here what else is
101:25 - happening
101:29 - um all right now can is this the pipes
101:32 - screensaver
101:33 - apparently it is it was not my intention
101:36 - i probably should brand this like redo
101:38 - the coding challenge as
101:41 - windows pipes screensaver and that would
101:43 - be good clickbait
101:47 - let me just see now if i can
101:50 - do something kind of nice
101:54 - which is make this window width
101:59 - window height
102:02 - file share and get
102:05 - this we hit stop i'll share
102:09 - and get this view
102:19 - view enter full screen
102:25 - and here we are everybody let's just
102:28 - enjoy this for a little bit
102:39 - this is a self-avoiding walk
102:42 - in three dimensions people really want
102:44 - me to add color
102:45 - [Laughter]
102:50 - but i want to look at bezier curves
102:52 - today i only have 20 minutes left oh the
102:56 - live
102:56 - poll i forgot about the live
103:00 - poll all right i have no idea if the
103:03 - live poll is gonna work
103:05 - but there's been so many um
103:10 - uh music please i don't know i don't
103:12 - really got any uh
103:29 - [Music]
103:49 - okay i'm still here by the way all right
103:52 - let's add color
103:53 - [Music]
103:55 - bessie by the way uh for all of you um
103:58 - [Music]
104:00 - we're wondering when is the next live
104:01 - stream it's tomorrow
104:04 - so i can do the bezier curve stuff i
104:07 - want to do tomorrow
104:09 - um let's add some color okay so what's
104:12 - going to be the best way to do this
104:15 - all right let's try um
104:20 - where am i i don't think though
104:24 - um i have to change the way that i'm
104:27 - drawing it
104:29 - because um
104:33 - unfortunately i'm drawing it as one
104:34 - continuous line
104:38 - and um raycasting coding challenge of
104:42 - the infamous maze from windows 98 would
104:45 - be a nice next step
104:47 - that's a great suggestion cola games a
104:49 - random walk with bezier curves
104:51 - oh that is such a good idea tomorrow so
104:54 - i'm live streaming tomorrow around 2 p.m
104:55 - eastern
104:57 - um you know i'm kind of cramming in oh
104:59 - i've committed to doing a bunch of live
105:01 - streams this
105:02 - month but i didn't get to them so i'm
105:03 - cramming them in at the end
105:05 - so i'm doing another one tomorrow but
105:07 - let's see i think what i would need to
105:09 - do
105:10 - is draw them as individual lines
105:13 - so let me just try something first real
105:16 - quick which is
105:26 - v1 is path index i
105:29 - v two is path index i
105:33 - plus one and then if i'm drawing a line
105:37 - from v
105:37 - one dot x v one dot y
105:40 - v one dot z
105:49 - uh dot y d2 dot z
105:54 - is this the same result yeah
105:57 - okay great so now i can do individual
105:59 - colors
106:00 - because i can take
106:05 - um i have a crazy idea here i should
106:07 - probably do hue
106:12 - maybe i should just do it as um
106:17 - just using hsb mode well the way i was
106:20 - going to do it since we have x y z
106:23 - is r is map v one v1.x
106:27 - which goes between 0 and the number of
106:30 - columns
106:32 - to between 0 and 255.
106:36 - let's just try this real quick g b
106:42 - uh and so i think someone said layers
106:44 - could be instead of depth
106:46 - it could be a good idea uh stroke rgb
106:50 - let's just try this
106:56 - there's some colors appearing here
107:00 - what did i miss v1 xyz
107:04 - zero column
107:21 - what am i missing here
107:26 - oh i could do map the path dot
107:29 - length distance from the center
107:34 - interesting uh yes
107:37 - okay wait why are the most of them just
107:43 - oh it's x x
107:47 - there we go this is what i need to do
107:51 - there we go so this is
107:54 - uh a different way of doing it
107:59 - let's take a look at how this looks and
108:01 - i wonder if actually i should have a
108:03 - minimum amount of
108:04 - color
108:07 - for each just to sort of enforce
108:10 - some amount of brightness and now let's
108:12 - hit save
108:14 - let's go to here see the full screen
108:17 - version
108:19 - cola game says i forgot to add that i
108:21 - could never thank you enough for getting
108:22 - me interested in programming literally
108:24 - shaped the course of my life oh that's
108:26 - so nice
108:27 - thank you
108:30 - uh your passion for what you do is
108:31 - amazing yeah all of the coordinates are
108:33 - positive
108:34 - so this was kind of a nice um idea
108:37 - of a way of doing it and um but i do
108:40 - think that cycling the
108:43 - hue along the path is maybe a nicer way
108:47 - of doing it
108:48 - so this is a
108:51 - different way of doing it would be so
108:53 - that's one way
108:56 - let's say let me comment this out too
108:58 - let me say a
109:00 - color mode hsb
109:03 - so now what if i say uh stroke
109:07 - i modulus 360 that's the hue
109:12 - and then just have these max out at 100.
109:18 - oh i still need these two points
109:23 - yeah i think this is what people were
109:24 - looking for
109:27 - uh so let's see this
109:34 - what happened here
109:43 - there we go
109:47 - so this i think is what folks were
109:49 - looking for this definitely works better
109:52 - in terms of being ridiculously colorful
109:55 - self-avoiding walk but i i i can do
109:58 - i could do you one better here
110:02 - let's add the frame count
110:10 - so now it is also psych
110:15 - the frame count gets added before i take
110:19 - the modulus
110:27 - and now is the cycling too
110:31 - fast do you even notice it does anybody
110:33 - care
110:37 - i like this i mean i could make it
110:40 - i always thought i could make it like
110:42 - more extreme
110:46 - very blinky let's just do it by two
110:58 - i don't know maybe the softness slowness
111:00 - of it is fine
111:02 - um all right ready here we go
111:09 - we are finishing today's live stream
111:14 - with this
111:20 - self-avoiding walk is it possible to
111:24 - make the lines
111:25 - thicker yeah i was making them thinner
111:27 - on purpose but yeah i can try that
111:35 - did i just close the other the code no
111:38 - it's just in another tab
111:40 - let's we can make the we can go back to
111:42 - what i had before
111:49 - i think that took are they thicker
111:52 - [Music]
111:55 - oh no that's for the point
111:58 - [Music]
112:00 - where's the stroke weight there it is
112:06 - [Music]
112:12 - [Music]
112:14 - the problem is um you can see there's a
112:18 - flaw
112:19 - at the end
112:30 - well this is a nice place to wrap up
112:33 - today's live stream
112:35 - with my 3d self-avoiding walk
112:39 - rainbow rainbow colored self-avoiding
112:44 - [Music]
112:51 - god this is bringing me enormous joy
112:58 - i don't need to be in the image here
113:13 - [Music]
113:22 - i don't know if that music really went
113:23 - with let's see what a little music do i
113:25 - have
113:33 - i forgot that does really work
113:48 - this kind of works
114:03 - [Applause]
114:06 - so
114:09 - the drawing nicole says if the drawing
114:11 - point was also
114:13 - a specular light could look pretty cool
114:18 - that would be kind of amazing all right
114:21 - um i'm i'm
114:22 - wrapping this up i'm i'm a little
114:23 - disappointed in myself now because
114:26 - um the the coding challenge definitely
114:29 - like if
114:30 - this were the end result of the coding
114:31 - challenge i mean i could record
114:34 - another like five minutes of extending
114:36 - it into 3d
114:38 - um but um i think i should just let it
114:42 - let it be
114:43 - um but like i love the idea of branding
114:48 - this coding challenge as the windows
114:49 - pipes
114:50 - screensaver
114:54 - yeah it would definitely that would
114:56 - definitely help
114:57 - its uh youtube popularity i'll have to
115:00 - think about that
115:01 - i have to think about whether i have
115:02 - that
115:04 - uh yeah it's so uh um alex is in the
115:07 - chat is pointing it's slowing down a bit
115:09 - so you know this
115:12 - uh this is a limitation of
115:16 - you know javascript canvas and
115:20 - the number of vertices that i'm drawing
115:22 - for all of these lines
115:24 - um we don't know if there would be
115:29 - i'm sure there are some efficiencies
115:30 - that could be added here or
115:33 - geometry that could be saved and
115:36 - in a way that it gets rendered more in
115:39 - an optimized way because it's not
115:41 - those points aren't moving although
115:47 - my five minutes left in my allocated
115:50 - amount of time
115:50 - trying to be good about just streaming
115:52 - for two hours the poll is forgotten yeah
115:54 - i'll have to come back for the poll
115:55 - tomorrow
115:56 - i just went ahead and um but one idea
115:59 - that i kind of have
116:02 - just out of curiosity
116:07 - oh no no that won't yeah actually it
116:09 - will
116:10 - um what if i did something crazy
116:19 - and just like jiggled all the points oh
116:21 - yeah that is
116:22 - [Laughter]
116:25 - i mean i
116:29 - i don't know what i expected to happen
116:31 - there but that's really kind of nuts
116:35 - yeah i should be using something more
116:37 - like
116:39 - thoughtful in terms of uh
116:43 - uh and like maybe
116:50 - what's interesting is i'm storing all
116:52 - the xy positions of all these points
116:54 - separately from where they are in the
116:56 - array so
116:58 - there's not really any reason why it
116:59 - couldn't over time
117:01 - [Music]
117:03 - kind of disintegrate and get a little
117:05 - bit more like look at it's kind of
117:08 - getting wonky as we go
117:17 - um it probably would make more sense for
117:19 - me to use a particular algorithm that
117:21 - retained
117:23 - a displacement from its original but i
117:25 - like the idea of it being less
117:28 - kind of exact and actually maybe that's
117:30 - maybe instead of
117:32 - moving it randomly i should just offset
117:34 - them a little bit
117:36 - like so in other words
117:40 - like what if actually instead of doing
117:42 - that in the actual
117:44 - spot class when i make
117:47 - the x position
117:52 - like what if i just say plus
117:57 - offset based on the spacing
118:00 - so it will be in a regular grid
118:03 - visually still the data still retains
118:06 - its that's too much i suppose
118:16 - i cannot stop i need a time
118:20 - limit which i am now down to three
118:22 - minutes left
118:26 - still too much
118:31 - yeah this is kind of more what i'm
118:32 - looking for
118:39 - maybe not enough
118:48 - yeah so this is interesting so let me
118:50 - just let's let's go look at this in the
118:51 - full screen one
118:57 - so this is just adding a little bit of
118:58 - noise so that it kind of
119:01 - looks perhaps a little bit more sketched
119:08 - um you know i think that's sort of an
119:10 - interesting
119:11 - uh twist on this um it still is very
119:15 - blocky
119:16 - you know i could certainly try to make
119:17 - it more like curved lines
119:20 - but i kind of like this um adding a
119:22 - little
119:23 - uh mess to it all right i'm gonna see uh
119:26 - so
119:26 - so by the way um please join the discord
119:30 - and try out all of the discord bot stuff
119:33 - um message um message us and give us
119:36 - feedback
119:37 - about how to improve that um it's not
119:40 - windows xp
119:40 - now anymore um i will be um
119:44 - back tomorrow if you can believe that uh
119:47 - my goal
119:47 - i haven't i didn't i didn't set the time
119:50 - yet but it's um
119:51 - i have stuff in the morning so probably
119:53 - around 2 p.m eastern also for about
119:56 - two hours
119:59 - and yes cat king writes uh in the chat
120:04 - um breaking news
120:08 - coding train releases a copyright disco
120:11 - sensation that's gripping our nation
120:13 - um but yeah let's look at seeing if we
120:15 - can add bezier curves to this tomorrow
120:17 - and see what we get um thank you
120:20 - everyone for joining today
120:22 - um i have this little uh goodbye
120:26 - song that's about three minutes long
120:30 - so i'm gonna set this to full screen
120:36 - and refresh the page and
120:40 - ethan asks and answers some questions
120:42 - why don't you update your macbook to big
120:44 - sir
120:45 - i'm afraid too should i do that
120:49 - couldn't hurt uh did you try the new
120:52 - slash commands i have not tried the new
120:54 - slash commands yet
120:56 - but i do intend to do so at some point
120:59 - soon
121:01 - um cat king says bye
121:04 - bye to you as well uh just a quick
121:08 - uh shout out thank you to today's
121:10 - sponsor brilliant.org
121:12 - codingtrain you can sign up for free
121:14 - there i don't know is there a course or
121:16 - puzzle that has
121:17 - that is related to the this uh 3d
121:20 - self-avoiding walk i'd love to know
121:23 - mutate the xyz while drawing every frame
121:26 - so over time it would disintegrate with
121:28 - the cumulative effect
121:29 - yes that's what i started with but it
121:31 - became too
121:33 - disintegrated what would be really cool
121:35 - is to add spring forces between them
121:37 - so they could kind of like uh like add a
121:40 - spring force between like where it's
121:42 - supposed to be
121:43 - and it's offset so they could kind of
121:45 - jiggle but always
121:46 - spring back into place that might be
121:48 - interesting
121:50 - um after today's news i'm quite glad
121:53 - that i didn't buy an
121:53 - m1 says julian i don't know what today's
121:56 - news is i don't have to fill me in on
121:58 - that
121:59 - um we will need a processing conversion
122:01 - if we're adding curves to this
122:04 - yeah so i definitely would like to make
122:05 - a processing version of this that
122:06 - wouldn't be too
122:08 - difficult in many ways this is probably
122:10 - well suited to
122:11 - processing in order to keep its
122:14 - efficiency you could have the old lines
122:16 - become slowly transparent and delete
122:18 - them
122:19 - [Music]
122:20 - excellent suggestion from razif
122:24 - an essay says i want to see this with
122:26 - spring forces so much
122:27 - me too me too that'll have to be
122:30 - another one at some point um
122:32 - [Music]
122:35 - thank you all for tuning in to today's
122:37 - live stream
122:38 - um i may i think i'll probably like
