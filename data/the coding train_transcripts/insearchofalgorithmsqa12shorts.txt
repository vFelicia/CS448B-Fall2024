00:00 - hi I'm Dan from The Cutting train and
00:02 - I'll be answering your questions today
00:03 - this is the Arcane algorithm archive
00:06 - which is organized by James sloth
00:08 - floodfill I have a song about flood fill
00:10 - it's flood fill time computers domain
00:13 - coloring looks like something that I
00:14 - could maybe attempt at some point ooh
00:16 - that's a pretty image complex yes this
00:19 - looks like something that could be a
00:20 - coding challenge but of course you could
00:22 - watch James's video on it from the Leos
00:24 - Labs YouTube channel if you want to
00:25 - learn more about some of the sources
00:27 - I've used I might suggest that creative
00:30 - code page which is curated by taru
00:32 - muhonen and Rafael De Corville look at
00:34 - all these algorithms all the different
00:36 - noises domain warping was that in the
00:39 - pocket handbook many of these I've done
00:41 - but quite a few of them I have not what
00:43 - am I missing here what are some
00:44 - resources that I'm not thinking of I'm
00:46 - sure if you're watching this you have a
00:48 - way of finding algorithms or things you
00:50 - would like me to tackle in a future
00:51 - video so definitely let me know in the
00:53 - comments and I can address it in less
00:55 - than a minute or in a 700 hour coding
00:58 - Challenge video
