00:03 - hold on okay hi okay in this video we're
00:06 - going to talk about pendulums um now
00:09 - pendulums is really just this perfect
00:11 - perfect thing to look at right now
00:12 - because it it combines everything we've
00:14 - looked at really from the beginning of
00:16 - chapter 2 all the way up until now there
00:18 - are forces at play there's the force of
00:20 - gravity on the pendulum that's what
00:22 - causes it to swing but we need in order
00:24 - to deal in order to solve that simulate
00:26 - the pendulum we're going to need to look
00:27 - at trigonometry s and cosine again polar
00:30 - C polar coordinates and then we're also
00:32 - going to deal with angular motion the
00:34 - angle of the pendulum what's its angular
00:36 - velocity what's its angular acceleration
00:38 - so all these things are going to come
00:39 - into play and so it's a really nice it's
00:42 - a nice nice place to be for us right now
00:44 - now you know the question is how what
00:47 - how what are you going to do with this
00:48 - um on the one hand you might want to
00:50 - make a processing sketch with lots of
00:52 - pendulums if that's what you want to do
00:54 - perfect you're in exactly the right
00:55 - place but really what I'm hoping for
00:57 - this is if you can understand the
00:58 - pendulum scenario
01:00 - figure out how all the math works and
01:02 - apply it to a simulation then when you
01:04 - come across some scenario in your idea
01:07 - in your sketch with similar qualities
01:09 - you're going to be able to figure out
01:10 - the trigonometry problems the angular
01:12 - motion problems the forces problems okay
01:14 - so let's get started I'm I want to draw
01:16 - the pendulum I'm going to start by
01:17 - drawing the pendulum in two different
01:19 - ways this is a drawing a diagram of a
01:23 - pendulum at rest right there is this
01:25 - thing called an arm this is the arm and
01:28 - this thing called The Bob and and this
01:30 - is the Bob so this is our pendulum it's
01:32 - at rest now if we were to lift this up
01:35 - over here and let go it would swing back
01:37 - and forth like that so let's draw the
01:39 - diagram that
01:41 - way here's the pendulum now at an angle
01:45 - so an the the angle of the pendulum is a
01:47 - key property that we're going to need to
01:49 - look at and what do we mean by angle we
01:52 - mean the angle relative to the the axis
01:54 - of at being at rest so that angle Theta
01:57 - is relative the axis of where it would
01:59 - be hanging for at rest now what are what
02:01 - do let's let's let's start okay before
02:03 - we even figure out how to swing the
02:05 - pendulum you know sometimes this is a
02:06 - good thing to do when you're creating
02:08 - processing sketches like you know you
02:09 - want a swinging pendulum well can you
02:10 - even get the sort of static pendulum
02:13 - appearing on the screen in the one hand
02:15 - it's easy a line from here to there and
02:17 - a circle that's what we're going to do
02:19 - but let's look at what do we need in
02:20 - order to have this we need to know this
02:23 - location which we'll call the origin the
02:26 - origin XY we need to know the Bob's X Y
02:30 - and this is going to be an important
02:32 - value as well this is the length of the
02:35 - arm so what's the length of the arm this
02:38 - and of course we're going to deal with
02:39 - the angle Theta so let's actually just
02:41 - take a look I have a kind of a
02:42 - processing sketch that's already built
02:44 - um that do is doing just this part just
02:47 - to with the static what we're going to
02:48 - do in this video is we're going to piece
02:49 - by piece add all the simulation parts
02:52 - and have and eventually have this
02:53 - pendulum swinging okay so if we look
02:56 - over here uh we have a really simple
02:59 - sketch which just just has two B vectors
03:01 - one for the origin the top point one for
03:03 - the Bob's location and the length of
03:05 - that arm and we can see here that the
03:07 - Bob uh location is just the same x value
03:10 - as the origin but the yvalue is the
03:12 - length of that arm so that's all we're
03:14 - doing is want to is is drawing a line
03:17 - from the origin to the Bob and a circle
03:19 - where the Bob is so that's what we've
03:20 - got but that's only going to work if the
03:23 - pendulum's at rest what if the pendulum
03:26 - has an angle what if we lift that up to
03:27 - the side how do we do that okay that is
03:29 - part you know two of this video in
03:32 - however many parts okay so back over
03:34 - here let's take a look at that so let's
03:36 - say we know what the angle is we know
03:38 - the angle is say 45Â° or pi divided by
03:43 - four okay so we're going to say the
03:46 - angle or
03:47 - Theta has some value in this case we're
03:50 - going to say is Pi / 4 how do we get
03:53 - this location well let's take a look at
03:55 - something let's draw a right triangle
03:58 - here let's make this into a right
04:00 - triangle this is y and this is
04:04 - X origin uh from the origin we have to
04:07 - go down this much Y and over this x to
04:09 - find the Bob location assuming that
04:11 - angle so let's do a little trigonometry
04:15 - sooa all we need is SOA s and C so s of
04:23 - theta equals opposite over
04:26 - hypotenuse x / length
04:30 - opposite is X hypotenuse is the length
04:32 - of the pendulum in this case that is
04:34 - really important in our scenario in our
04:36 - right triangle the length is the
04:38 - hypotenuse the hypotenuse of that
04:39 - triangle is the
04:40 - length oh sorry cosine of
04:45 - theta is adjacent over hypotenuse or Y /
04:51 - length and this means that if we know
04:54 - the if we know the length and we know
04:56 - the angle we're going to be able to find
04:58 - the X and the Y because we can say x =
05:02 - length * sin of th and Y = length time
05:08 - cosine of theta this is exactly what we
05:10 - did in the polar to cartisian coordinate
05:12 - transformation video if you want you can
05:15 - go back and watch that one again we're
05:16 - doing exactly the same thing here I
05:18 - should say that things are a little bit
05:19 - flipped usually we look at an angle
05:21 - relative to the x-axis now we're looking
05:23 - at an angle relative to the Y AIS so you
05:25 - can see X has got s in the equation and
05:28 - Y has got cosine in the equation but if
05:30 - we can draw that right triangle and we
05:32 - can remember s opposite hypotenuse
05:35 - cosine adjacent hypotenuse then we can
05:37 - always derive these formulas and figure
05:38 - it out so we've got that let's go back
05:40 - to our processing sketch and put these
05:42 - formulas right in there okay come with
05:45 - me over here I I should like take off I
05:48 - have a sweater but anyway okay here we
05:50 - go uh now where where let's okay we've
05:53 - got this sketch okay first thing we need
05:56 - to do is add an angle variable to it so
05:58 - at the top I'm going to say hey float
06:00 - angle and that angle's just going to be
06:02 - zero for right now and now what we want
06:04 - to do is say Okay based on what that
06:07 - angle is I need to compute the Bob's
06:10 - location so what was the formula it's
06:13 - over here uh X length s y length cosine
06:18 - so if I come back here uh I can say Bob
06:21 - dox equals
06:24 - length Time s of the angle and
06:28 - Boby equals
06:31 - length time cosine of the
06:34 - angle now what did we miss there's one
06:37 - thing we missed in this equation here
06:38 - I'm going to come back over here for a
06:39 - second is that this Y and X is relative
06:42 - to the origin right we want to go this
06:45 - much y from the origin and this much X
06:48 - from the origin so we need to add we
06:50 - need to add the Y and the X to the
06:52 - origin's location so when we come back
06:54 - over here we're going to say okay the
06:56 - Bob's X location is origin X Plus that
06:59 - and the Bob's Y location is origin y
07:01 - plus that in truth of course we could
07:03 - have done this with uh we could have
07:05 - used P vector and the P vector's add
07:07 - function but just to kind of look at the
07:08 - formula in a sort of simplest way I
07:10 - think this is useful so let's run this
07:14 - now uh whoops I have an error can't find
07:17 - anything named length Okay in my in this
07:19 - particular sketch I named it Len rather
07:21 - than the full word length so I'm just
07:23 - going to correct that right
07:24 - now I'm going to run this and we can see
07:27 - ah there it is the same place that used
07:29 - to be but now we should be able to go
07:34 - and change that angle what if I made
07:36 - that angle pi divided by
07:38 - four right there we go now we have the
07:41 - pendulum at 45 degrees and I could do
07:44 - something like
07:46 - say I can start to increment the angle
07:50 - by some small amount and you can see the
07:52 - pendulum is starting to
07:54 - rotate and eventually it will come back
07:57 - I guess I should have subtracted that
07:59 - right it's moving but now we're not so
08:01 - so this is what we did essentially in
08:03 - some of our earlier videos we just have
08:04 - this thing moving with polar cartisian
08:06 - coordinates around and around now we
08:08 - need to actually look at why do we what
08:11 - is the force of the pendulum and how
08:13 - does that Force get applied to
08:14 - acceleration so let's go take a look at
08:16 - that and guess what we're going to use
08:17 - sign again s and cosine again okay so
08:20 - we'll let this keep spinning around kind
08:22 - of weirdly like it is and
08:28 - now so okay so let's come back to our
08:32 - pendulum we figured out how to draw the
08:34 - pendulum in the right place now what we
08:36 - need to do is figure out what is the
08:38 - angular acceleration of the pendulum
08:40 - okay so what are we talking about
08:44 - here here's the pendulum now the
08:47 - pendulum has a force of gravity on it
08:51 - that's the force of gravity it's pulling
08:52 - it down now the reason why the Bob
08:54 - doesn't just fall straight down is
08:56 - because you know there's a force of
08:57 - tension there's this Rod here there's
08:59 - this metal it's not metal whatever this
09:01 - whatever it is whatever it might be
09:03 - there's this arm here that's keeping it
09:04 - so we know the pendulum is going to move
09:07 - actually this direction right this is a
09:10 - right angle here so what we're actually
09:13 - looking for I'm going to draw another
09:15 - right
09:16 - triangle is this particular
09:19 - force that particular force is what we
09:23 - would call the force of the
09:26 - pendulum and interestingly enough we
09:29 - have have a right triangle here and if I
09:34 - extend this diagram a little bit and
09:36 - draw the axis for the pendulum at rest
09:38 - this is our angle Theta this is also our
09:40 - angle Theta so what we've actually done
09:44 - here this is kind of a little bit this
09:45 - is a big moment because this is kind of
09:48 - an important concept that's going to
09:50 - come up again and again in some future
09:51 - examples we've separated the out a
09:55 - particular Vector into components along
09:58 - an arbitrary axis so we know that
10:00 - vectors have components this Vector has
10:04 - an X and A Y component and we do this
10:06 - all the time because we have P vector v
10:09 - equals new P Vector X comma y right we
10:12 - think about the vector in terms of we
10:13 - know it's magnitude and Direction but
10:14 - really you know in the vector there's an
10:17 - X and A Y but we always do that relative
10:19 - to the x-axis here what we've done is
10:22 - separated this Vector out in terms of
10:24 - components relative to the axis of the
10:27 - pendulum and we need this particular
10:29 - component to be the force of the
10:32 - pendulum okay so what how do we get that
10:36 - well look at this what is if we call
10:39 - this FP I don't like the way I drew that
10:42 - let's just remedy that if this side is
10:44 - FP and this side is f of G notice
10:47 - something s of theta equals the force of
10:50 - the pendulum divided by the force of
10:55 - gravity whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a
10:57 - second that's right right yeah of theta
11:00 - is opposite over hypotenuse that's the
11:02 - opposite that's the hypotenuse so what
11:04 - is the force of the pendulum it's just
11:07 - the force of gravity times s of
11:11 - theta now in truth there are some some
11:14 - missing pieces here and I'm not going to
11:16 - get first of all I'm not qualified to go
11:19 - through every little detail of
11:20 - everything that's happening in a
11:21 - pendulum in terms of torque and tension
11:24 - and air resistance and you know you
11:25 - could get into a really really elaborate
11:27 - simulation if you want to but this even
11:30 - just this much is going to do us a whole
11:33 - lot of good um uh we can add something
11:36 - to this which I'll do which I'll show
11:37 - you in a little bit later but this is
11:39 - this just being able to realize that the
11:41 - force how strong that Force is is sign
11:44 - of the angle if you think about that
11:46 - right when the pendulum's um at rest
11:49 - what's the angle it's zero what's sign
11:50 - of the angle zero so there's no Force
11:53 - there's no force of the pendulum um
11:56 - because the the pendulum's at rest um
11:58 - I'm sitting down so so sitting down like
12:01 - in its resting
12:02 - spot I could really use a script to
12:04 - write about someone wants to write one
12:06 - okay um so what do we need to do with
12:09 - this remember something Force equals
12:12 - mass time acceleration you know what is
12:14 - the force of gravity GF * m / distance
12:19 - squar all this stuff for us we can think
12:21 - of the force of gravity as a constant
12:23 - scaled by mass and the
12:27 - acceleration is equal to the force of
12:29 - the pendulum divid by mass so what we've
12:33 - really got in the end is acceler the
12:36 - angular acceleration of the
12:38 - pendulum is equal to the force of graph
12:41 - some constant kind of botch this times s
12:44 - of
12:47 - theta edit edit I'm not going to edit
12:49 - these someday I'll edit these let me go
12:51 - back and try that
12:52 - again okay for our purposes in this
12:55 - particular example we're going to
12:57 - consider the force of gravity to be a
13:01 - constant it is the equivalent of some
13:04 - constant times mass right because the
13:07 - more massive an object is the stronger
13:09 - the force of gravity so we're going to
13:11 - say some constant gtimes mass is the
13:14 - force of gravity time sin / Theta that's
13:18 - the force of the pendulum a constant the
13:21 - gravitational force times the object the
13:23 - Bob's mass time s of theta so what does
13:26 - that mean the acceleration is the
13:29 - angular acceleration of the pendulum is
13:30 - equal to the force divided by mass take
13:33 - G * mass time s of theta and divide it
13:35 - by mass and we have the pendulum's
13:37 - acceleration is equal to Su constant
13:40 - Time s of theta if that seems overly
13:43 - simple to you then great because in the
13:46 - end it's actually quite simple we're
13:48 - just scaling the acceleration is is
13:51 - essentially some constant times sign of
13:53 - the angle so that's why you know if you
13:56 - think like what wait sign oscillates
13:58 - theend oscillates it's all related it's
14:00 - all this magical soup of oscillation and
14:03 - trigonometry so but this is the formula
14:05 - we've now got this formula let's go
14:07 - stick this formula into our code and if
14:09 - you didn't understand this formula I
14:10 - don't know maybe re-watch the video and
14:13 - it'll make sense the second time or you
14:15 - don't know send me an email and I'm
14:17 - going to try to help do this explanation
14:19 - again u in the book maybe it's like it's
14:21 - edited so it's less um cockamamy okay um
14:25 - so here we are back again uh and now
14:27 - we're going to add this so first of all
14:29 - what's going on here this by the way 0
14:33 - 0.01 is the angular velocity the change
14:36 - in the angle is angular velocity so I'm
14:38 - going to go back and I'm going to add
14:40 - some more variables angular velocity and
14:42 - going make that zero and I'm make
14:44 - angular acceleration and I'm going to
14:45 - make that uh zero as well so our motion
14:50 - algorithm right is angle angle changes
14:53 - by
14:55 - velocity and velocity changes by EX
14:59 - acceleration and if we've got this we
15:01 - can see it's not moving why we haven't
15:03 - calculated the angular acceleration but
15:06 - we have this formula over here to
15:08 - calculate that angular acceleration G *
15:10 - s of theta G is a constant so we can
15:13 - just come over here and we can say
15:16 - angular acceleration equals some
15:18 - constant I don't know 0.01 * s of that
15:22 - Angle now a couple things are going to
15:24 - go wrong here but let's let's let this
15:26 - go okay first of all it's kind of
15:29 - swinging but it's swinging upside down
15:31 - so somewhere somehow we got our wires
15:34 - crossed and we you know we were doing
15:36 - this physics simulation and not this
15:38 - this diagrams and we were probably
15:40 - thinking of Y going up and in a
15:42 - processing window y goes down so we
15:44 - could investigate this but sometimes
15:45 - when something goes in the wrong
15:47 - direction you know we're we're
15:48 - processing programmers we can just kind
15:50 - of we we know we don't have to
15:52 - understand at all we just know multiply
15:54 - by negative 1 we'll go in the other
15:55 - direction so I'm going to just say
15:57 - negative .01 we're we're we're flipped
15:59 - we got to flip our world back upside you
16:01 - know processing points down we don't
16:03 - want to point up we got to flip
16:04 - ourselves negative one Okay now what's
16:07 - the other thing going on here I think
16:08 - it'd probably be useful to add a little
16:10 - bit of damping to make it feel a little
16:12 - realistic right a pendulum is going to
16:15 - be a lot lost in the kind of in the in
16:17 - the in the movement of the arm in air
16:19 - resistance so one thing I'm just going
16:21 - to do to like make it look a little
16:22 - nicer is multiply the velocity by like
16:25 - 99 each time 0 99 so the velocity
16:28 - reduces by one 1% so a pendulum doesn't
16:30 - swing forever it's going to kind of slow
16:32 - down and eventually come to rest and now
16:33 - if we run this hey that's pretty good
16:36 - it's swinging so we have our swinging
16:38 - pendulum wow it was as easy as that
16:40 - right if we know where the origin is and
16:43 - we know the angle we know the length we
16:45 - can calculate where the Bob is and if we
16:48 - understand that the angular acceleration
16:50 - of the pendulum is equal to the force of
16:51 - gravity times sign of that angle and we
16:53 - were able to derive that formula of the
16:55 - diagram then we can just put that right
16:57 - here in our code and we're good to go
17:00 - now so this was a little example of just
17:02 - kind of like whipping it together and
17:03 - draw and I guess actually I want to make
17:05 - a point here which is that um and this
17:07 - is certainly how I work although there's
17:09 - lots of different ways of working and
17:10 - farbe it for me to suggest that this is
17:12 - the best by any means but as you can see
17:14 - we didn't get ourselves kind of lost in
17:16 - object-oriented programming right now we
17:18 - just kind of have this main sketch and
17:21 - this main program we kind of set up and
17:22 - draw we knew we need a bunch of
17:23 - variables we're kind of working out we
17:25 - have the pendulum working now I'm not
17:27 - going to in this video take the next 10
17:29 - minutes to move everything into an
17:31 - object and build that object I kind of
17:32 - have that preset for you but this is you
17:35 - know this is often a good way to work
17:36 - kind of work out your you know work out
17:39 - everything in just kind of a raw and a
17:42 - messy way in in the main Tab and then
17:44 - once you've got the functionality
17:45 - refactor and build it into a class and
17:48 - so what I'm just going to show you now
17:49 - is if you're following along there is an
17:51 - example in oh I don't want to um I don't
17:54 - want the app store right now um there is
17:57 - this particular example which we can see
17:59 - has a pendulum object the pendulum
18:02 - object the Constructor takes two things
18:04 - it's where is the origin and how long is
18:07 - the arm and then you can see in draw all
18:10 - we're doing is saying P.O run all your
18:12 - simulation stuff we've actually added a
18:14 - few features in this example you can
18:16 - click on the pendulum and move it um so
18:19 - this is kind of a uh you know this is
18:22 - just the objectoriented version but you
18:24 - can see that everything that we worked
18:26 - out is all right here in the update
18:29 - function so in the update function we
18:31 - have a constant for Gravity we have the
18:33 - formula for angular acceleration angular
18:35 - acceleration goes into the velocity the
18:37 - velocity is dampened then the velocity
18:38 - then angle changes by the velocity so
18:40 - everything we worked out is here now in
18:41 - the pendulum's update function the one
18:44 - thing I should say is there's one extra
18:45 - thing which is that we divided by R the
18:49 - angular acceleration is affected by how
18:51 - long that arm is and this makes the the
18:53 - pendulum feel a bit more realistic I'll
18:55 - include some links to other physics
18:57 - discussions of pendulums but you can see
18:59 - that now if I make the pendulum arm
19:01 - really
19:03 - short it kind of swings much faster than
19:07 - if I made the pendulum arm really
19:10 - long and if I grab it you can see I let
19:12 - it swing there's a much sort of slower
19:14 - uh acceleration there because the short
19:17 - of the if we're the the acceleration is
19:19 - inversely proportional to the length of
19:20 - the arm so that's one little addition to
19:22 - this example that makes the pendulum
19:23 - feel a bit more realistic so um I'll
19:27 - give you a couple I have a couple EXC
19:28 - ideas which literally just occurred to
19:30 - me now well one of them occurred to me
19:31 - now and the other I guess I had already
19:33 - thought of but um hold on I just I don't
19:35 - know why I feel the need to put this
19:36 - back to where it was 175 um but there's
19:39 - a couple things so one thing you might
19:40 - try to do is if you remember I think in
19:42 - the first oscillation video uh we we
19:45 - looked at uh this uh other video there
19:48 - was a video in a video and it was very
19:50 - um what's that
19:52 - movie I don't know why I'm trying leca
19:55 - and it has nothing to do with anything
19:56 - edit cut okay and we're back and I
19:58 - didn't just talk about that but I did
20:00 - cuz no one's editing this um uh you know
20:02 - where there's levels of Dreams oh my God
20:05 - just stop go to the next video okay the
20:08 - exercise here's an exercise um try to
20:11 - create a whole bunch of pendulums in a
20:13 - row all across the top of a sketch
20:15 - perhaps start them all at slightly
20:17 - different offsets from each other I
20:19 - don't know give them all slightly
20:20 - different arm lengths give them all
20:22 - slightly different starting angles
20:24 - there's lots of ways you could create
20:25 - some type of really interesting um kind
20:27 - of multiple oscill pattern by doing that
20:31 - another thing you could do is put two
20:33 - pendulums together right uh what
20:39 - if the end of one pendulum is the
20:42 - beginning of another and so on and so
20:44 - forth now here's the thing this is
20:47 - what's called a double pendulum and
20:48 - simulating a double pendulum involves
20:50 - all sorts of uncomfortable and math that
20:54 - I don't even I don't even I mean I'm
20:56 - going to pull up that web page and I'm
20:57 - going to have to go sit down for a while
20:58 - and drink I don't some orange juice or
21:00 - something because I get a little woozy
21:01 - but um so you could look into sort of
21:04 - real double pendulum simulation and
21:05 - you'll find pages on Wikipedia and wolf
21:08 - from math world and all that sort of
21:09 - stuff but one thing you could do just as
21:10 - kind of a little experiment is see what
21:12 - happens if just you use the fact that
21:15 - this pendulum has a bob P vector and
21:17 - this pendulum has an origin P Vector
21:19 - what if you make those values always the
21:21 - same so at least they're sort of
21:22 - connected not they won't be connected in
21:24 - the physics way but they will be
21:25 - connected just in the fact that the code
21:27 - always sets those locations equal what
21:29 - types of effects could you get through
21:30 - that so um so those are some some ideas
21:33 - that you might try with this pendulum
21:35 - stuff and someday I'm going to go and
21:36 - make answers to all these exercises that
21:39 - I keep saying um and if you really want
21:40 - one if you send me an email it'll sort
21:42 - of push me to do that at least for this
21:44 - one and I'll put them in some open
21:46 - source repository for everyone to see
21:47 - okay so that I think this wasn't so bad
21:50 - I was a little anxious about this
21:51 - pendulum stuff but I think we did okay
21:53 - there's some improvements here um but in
21:55 - the next video we're going to look at
21:57 - Springs which is just another case study
21:59 - right we're going to say hey pendulums
22:01 - hey Springs these are two examples you
22:03 - know we don't need pendulums and springs
22:04 - in all of our sketches but these are two
22:06 - examples of kind of working out a
22:07 - physics system understanding the math
22:08 - behind it and making it go okay I need
22:10 - to find a button to shut this off
22:13 - now
