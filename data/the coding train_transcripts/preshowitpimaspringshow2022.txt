03:52 - check one two this is my mic coming
03:54 - through to you hopefully you hear me
03:56 - okay uh just to be clear i'll be on live
03:58 - on camera in about 40 seconds but this
04:01 - is not a coding train coding stream i'm
04:03 - just here to announce a couple things
04:06 - and then send you on over to see the
04:08 - wonderful projects
04:10 - from the students at the itp ima
04:11 - programs at nyu so oops 26 seconds left
04:15 - i got to get myself ready here
04:42 - [Music]
04:45 - oh the timer went down to zero
04:48 - oh look it's me hello hi everybody
04:53 - music has about 12 seconds in it um
04:55 - hello welcome i haven't done a live
04:56 - stream on youtube for a while it's
04:58 - because i've been streaming on a
04:59 - different platform i don't want i don't
05:02 - know if who's listening in here but you
05:04 - you can find me i'm sure if you just
05:06 - think of whatever popular streaming
05:08 - platform people might use and search
05:11 - search it up as the kids like to say
05:16 - oh i'm out of practice um so this is not
05:18 - your usual coding i don't know what your
05:20 - usual coding training live stream is by
05:22 - the way but if there ever is such a
05:24 - thing as a usual coding train live
05:26 - stream uh this is not it
05:28 - i'm just checking the chat here
05:30 - um
05:32 - because today is is extra special
05:35 - in fact i'm only gonna be here for like
05:37 - another 20 i mean i'm going to be here
05:39 - the whole time but i'm you're only going
05:41 - to be on this youtube account for the
05:44 - next 25-ish minutes because there is a
05:47 - new feature of youtube called live
05:49 - redirect and as you might recall if
05:52 - you've watched the coding train for a
05:53 - while every
05:56 - twice a year i do i try to do a stream
05:58 - from uh new york university itp ima
06:02 - program at tisch school of the arts to
06:03 - celebrate the work of all the wonderful
06:05 - students there
06:07 - and i'm on sabbatical this semester and
06:10 - i'm not there because i'm kind of far in
06:13 - my new home coding train studio
06:17 - um so but i'm still here to send you
06:21 - over to the itv show because it's back
06:23 - there actually has not been
06:25 - a live in-person itp show since
06:27 - 2019.
06:29 - i think i did some streams for some of
06:31 - the online exhibitions and different
06:32 - things there was yorb and all sorts of
06:34 - experiments but they're there
06:35 - live in person at nyu and i'm gonna send
06:38 - you there with youtube's live redirect
06:40 - feature and then i'm gonna hang out in
06:41 - the chat and watch
06:43 - um
06:44 - so and so hi from the netherlands uh hi
06:47 - to france but before i do any of that
06:50 - i want to just give you some really
06:52 - important and exciting coding train
06:55 - announcements
06:56 - answer any questions hello to italy
07:00 - um
07:02 - and arsenal writes i literally had a
07:04 - dream about you last night can you tell

07:34 - something thrills me more than uh seeing
07:36 - where everybody's from in the chat
07:38 - although i probably what would be nice
07:39 - is for me to come up with like
07:40 - interesting prompts and then everybody
07:42 - can share their answer to the prompt in
07:44 - the chat like what did you have for

10:11 - for some
10:12 - crowd source collaborative peanut butter
10:14 - vegan cookie recipe but
10:17 - um all right uh
10:20 - naloxion says a coding train stream best
10:23 - way to end a long debugging day at work
10:24 - well i hope your debugging day was not
10:27 - full of total and complete frustration
10:30 - um so i do want to tell you about uh

10:41 - information about the schedule
10:43 - about how to register
10:44 - um this is a virtual conference to talk
10:47 - about access in the open source software
10:48 - for the arts and greater issues beyond
10:50 - software themselves there will be theme
10:52 - sessions around critical web
10:54 - accessibility disability arts access and
10:56 - community building and access via
10:58 - translation
10:59 - so um there's
11:00 - i just can't say enough amazing things

11:23 - if you have questions about it um you
11:25 - know you can obviously uh you could
11:27 - tweet at p5xjs on twitter you could
11:29 - write to foundation processing.org which
11:32 - is just sort of a catch-all email
11:34 - address for any queries that are going
11:36 - related to processing foundation
11:37 - activities
11:39 - okay
11:40 - so
11:40 - i wanted to mention that that's item

14:15 - let me know
14:16 - uh tweet at me or or however people get
14:19 - in touch with each other these days
14:21 - the coding training discord that's where
14:23 - you should go
14:24 - codingtrain.com discord so guess what
14:27 - how much time do we got uh 340. oh i
14:28 - have lots of time why is it that somehow
14:31 - when i do live stream where i want to
14:33 - code something i feel like i have these
14:35 - introductory remarks which somehow take
14:38 - an hour and a half and i'm like okay
14:39 - i've got 20 minutes left where i've got

15:30 - so those are my two main uh announced
15:32 - two uh sort of event announcements that
15:34 - i wanted to bring up p5.js access day
15:38 - as well as processing community day
15:41 - copenhagen i hope to i don't i hope to
15:43 - join for p5 access day online
15:46 - um and i certainly um as of now
15:48 - according to this photo we'll be at
15:50 - processing community today in copenhagen
15:52 - all right so are you ready because if
15:54 - you think those were exciting
15:55 - announcements
15:59 - i had a really exciting one for you like
16:01 - way more exciting than either well okay
16:03 - so first of all
16:05 - when i talk about something be exciting
16:06 - let's let's set some parameters here i'm
16:09 - talking about something exciting in the
16:12 - you know well small contained universe
16:14 - that is the coding train so you know
16:16 - it's all relative we're talking about
16:17 - things that are like exciting in life
16:20 - uh i don't know how well this thing that
16:22 - i'm gonna tell you measures up or stacks
16:24 - up to all sorts of kinds of things that
16:26 - i could think about that would be
16:28 - exciting for anyone but for coding train
16:33 - this is exciting
16:34 - come to egypt in australia
16:37 - or austria i'm not sure which
16:39 - that country was i can't really entirely
16:42 - see it i oh wait
16:45 - i'm about to present to you
16:51 - this is a very long sound effect
16:54 - [Music]
16:56 - a work in progress almost completed kind
16:58 - of in progress version of the new coding
17:01 - train website
17:05 - that's not it
17:08 - here it is
17:09 - um so here it is this is a quote you
17:12 - don't see that here it is going to press
17:13 - this button here is a preview of the new
17:16 - coding train website um this has been a
17:20 - project in collaboration with design
17:22 - systems international
17:24 - um
17:25 - and there's a lot more to say about it
17:27 - and the process and a lot of thank yous
17:28 - and but it is not launched yet it is uh
17:31 - only at this url right now coding train
17:34 - slash preview.netfly.app
17:37 - so uh but what i want to do and i i plan
17:40 - to actually do like a full stream
17:43 - about the website going through it and
17:45 - and kind of soliciting help with
17:48 - you know expanding the content and and
17:51 - um
17:52 - all of that kind of stuff so this is
17:54 - just a sort of sneak preview of the
17:56 - sneak preview sneak preview of the
17:58 - preview this is the trailer to the
17:59 - trailer uh the actual website the plan
18:02 - is to launch it officially finished at
18:05 - processing
18:06 - community in copenhagen uh
18:09 - uh roon matson who is one of the
18:10 - founders of design systems international
18:12 - is also one of the organizers of pcd
18:14 - copenhagen and um i'm i'm so happy to
18:18 - see these nice comments in the chat
18:21 - so this is a labor of love uh so much
18:24 - has been put into this and but it also
18:26 - is quite raw and missing a lot there's a
18:28 - lot of placeholder content a lot of
18:30 - stuff hasn't come from the earlier
18:32 - website but i want to show you a couple
18:34 - things
18:35 - so number one let's just go to
18:37 - um let's go to the i'm gonna go under
18:39 - videos under challenges
18:42 - oh shoot i forgot to upload a custom
18:45 - thumbnail for this and it also says
18:49 - video number so you can see i forgot
18:51 - some things here so these are things by
18:53 - the way that you can help contribute to
18:55 - now but you'll see um
18:57 - every coding challenge this is a list of
18:59 - of all the coding challenges it's not
19:01 - all of them it's just the ones that
19:02 - we've brought over to the new website if
19:04 - i go to uh image to ascii for example if
19:07 - i click on this you'll see the video
19:09 - here
19:10 - timestamps are here on the right
19:13 - these are still kind of these are the
19:15 - links to all of the source code
19:17 - description there's references of
19:19 - different links that appear in the video
19:22 - there are other videos that um
19:25 - there are other videos that this one
19:27 - refers to
19:28 - um so this is hopefully a nice way
19:31 - to organize all of the content and
19:34 - metadata on youtube now youtube is
19:36 - amazing for search and discoverability
19:38 - and it's the primary platform where
19:40 - people engage with the coding train but
19:42 - it's important to me
19:43 - to have a website where if you're
19:45 - watching something on youtube and you're
19:47 - kind of like lost in the sense of like
19:49 - well
19:50 - what if i want to learn this more in
19:52 - order or where's the source code for
19:54 - this or you're talking about all these
19:56 - other links and where do i find them
19:58 - you know video i don't know if you've
19:59 - noticed but video descriptions on
20:01 - youtube are being
20:02 - what i would i would characterize as
20:03 - being phased out like they're obviously
20:05 - still there but they're more and more
20:06 - hidden by the interface
20:08 - um
20:09 - the youtube does a great job of
20:10 - chapterizing with time codes so that's a
20:12 - wonderful feature but in order to be
20:14 - able to sort of like document all the
20:16 - ancillary material that i have with each
20:18 - video that's what this website is really
20:20 - for as well as this concept so this the
20:23 - challenges and then there's the concept
20:25 - of tracks so that's the new term
20:27 - for what might otherwise be like a
20:29 - course or a playlist or a sequenced
20:31 - content piece of content so you'll see
20:33 - here there's the nature of code track
20:36 - there's the uh start the sort of
20:37 - beginner code programming with p5.js
20:40 - track and the ideas i mean these are
20:42 - again some placeholder images and um but
20:45 - the idea is to fill this out with all
20:46 - the different kinds of collections of
20:48 - videos whether they be full sequence
20:50 - courses or just um you know for example
20:53 - something like this algorithmic botany
20:56 - track was calling that like a side track
20:59 - is like just a collection of all the
21:00 - videos that deal with fractals and
21:02 - fractal trees so if i go to for example
21:05 - the nature of code track you'll see here
21:08 - on the right all the stops these are all
21:10 - of the videos in order and so if you can
21:13 - click around these and you'll sort of
21:15 - see where you are again the code
21:17 - examples are below as well as the
21:19 - description references videos etc now
21:22 - if you
21:24 - thank you stig for answering i have
21:25 - somebody i don't know who can post
21:27 - dsi's uh the url for their uh company
21:30 - and the website but um in in the chat
21:32 - but please do it maybe i'll do that in a
21:33 - minute so now
21:35 - here's the thing that i'm really really
21:38 - focused on why i want to bring this to
21:40 - you and i'm just taking looking at the
21:41 - time because i got a transition to
21:43 - talking about itp in about five minutes
21:46 - if i go back to the home page here
21:48 - you'll see here
21:50 - under uh
21:52 - uh under here there is the passenger
21:54 - showcase highlight so this is a
21:56 - particular um
21:58 - fractaloid interactive fractal branches
22:01 - uh by diego de la fuenta coraccio
22:04 - based on the recursion challenge uh we
22:06 - can click here i don't know if this will
22:08 - actually work and go and see their work
22:12 - um and i'm gonna hit allow i was gonna
22:14 - use my microphone oh my goodness okay
22:16 - hello
22:19 - cool okay so i'm not oh there we go um
22:22 - so you can see this is based on one of
22:23 - the videos but it responds to mic input
22:25 - so
22:26 - you can have your work here featured
22:29 - on the coding train home page for every
22:32 - uh video if i go to this one for example
22:35 - oops page not found that's a bug
22:37 - somebody report this book
22:39 - did that happen uh
22:42 - so let's go back to
22:43 - challenges let me go to i know i'm
22:45 - pretty sure the prime spiral one has
22:48 - there we go has some community
22:49 - contributions
22:50 - nope
22:51 - so let's see again all in progress here
22:54 - this is a good practice for when i uh
22:56 - really get to it okay videos challenges
22:58 - let's see the slide puzzle has some i
23:01 - remember seeing those so if i go to this
23:03 - slide puzzle video and scroll down a
23:05 - little bit
23:06 - you will see here under the passenger
23:08 - showcase so this is where
23:11 - um if you have a project that you've
23:13 - made inspired by or related to the
23:16 - particular video you can submit it to be
23:19 - here and it one of the goals with the
23:21 - website was to have the passenger
23:23 - showcase be much more primary so you can
23:26 - have a thumbnail you can have a link to
23:27 - your own website or social media link to
23:30 - the actual project itself there's only
23:31 - two here but this this can go and be
23:33 - like an infinite scroll basically i
23:36 - don't know if they shuffle randomly or
23:37 - appear in order
23:39 - but i would love to love for you to do
23:41 - so now i don't know if this link goes
23:43 - anywhere yet yeah the submitted
23:44 - contribution link doesn't go anywhere
23:46 - yet
23:47 - and in fact the next important thing
23:50 - that i need to show you and there might
23:51 - be some questions
23:52 - um
23:53 - in the chat so apologies if i'm missing
23:55 - them
23:56 - um
23:57 - this is the github repo for the website
24:01 - so go to github.com codingtrain
24:05 - thecodingtrain.com i'm actually going to
24:07 - let the site take over the domain soon
24:10 - um and so that will encourage people to
24:12 - use it don't bother pull requesting and
24:14 - filing issues on the old website not
24:17 - necessary
24:19 - and
24:20 - you can first of all if you want to
24:21 - follow the work that's going on you can
24:24 - read through some of these issues here
24:26 - there's one open pull request which is a
24:29 - very important one for this discussion
24:31 - which is this is the
24:32 - guide there's going to be a guide on the
24:34 - website for both how it works and how
24:37 - you can submit to the passenger showcase
24:40 - and there's a lot more to say about that
24:41 - eventually i think the plan is to have a
24:43 - form you could just fill out but at the
24:45 - moment you would need to do a pull
24:46 - request so let me just show you
24:48 - where you would do that and again the
24:50 - goal here is for this to be a welcoming
24:53 - friendly place for people to engage with
24:56 - open source and contributing to a
24:58 - website in a friend a friendly way for
25:01 - total beginners if you've never coded if
25:03 - you've never used git or github before
25:05 - come and try to do stuff with me on the
25:07 - coding drain website that's the whole
25:09 - point you're like some like i've got 30
25:12 - years of experience building websites
25:13 - and i'm i made git myself great you're
25:16 - welcome too but then you're not the
25:17 - primary audience
25:19 - primary audience is all of you who are
25:20 - just starting out uh and or or and or
25:23 - want to help others too you could be
25:25 - yeah that if that's your kind of thing
25:26 - that's my thing i mean i think that's
25:28 - what i want my thing to be um so
25:31 - showcase right so mate and i'm probably
25:33 - apologies if i'm mispronouncing your
25:34 - name mate is asking
25:36 - showcase will be based on pull requests
25:38 - so right now if you wanted to add and
25:40 - we're good we're slowly manually
25:42 - bringing over and we have some you know
25:44 - we might be able to automate this
25:46 - um but if you submitted a project to the
25:48 - previous website the goal is for that to
25:51 - make its way over but you're welcome to
25:53 - also just resubmit it again
25:55 - but basically if i go under content
25:58 - and let's say you wanted to submit let's
26:00 - say you recently watched the monty hall
26:04 - coding challenge which is my most recent
26:06 - i'm just moving some stuff over here the
26:08 - most recent coding challenge on the
26:10 - coding train if i go here to
26:14 - videos
26:16 - under challenges
26:18 - and i find
26:23 - did anybody see it monty hall monte hall
26:25 - monte hall monty hall there we go monty
26:26 - hall
26:29 - there is first of all there's this
26:30 - index.json file so this is actually all
26:33 - of the metadata and i'm sorry this is so
26:35 - small
26:36 - this is all of the metadata for the
26:38 - video so this is a static build website
26:40 - again lots more to say about that but
26:42 - you can just grab the whole repo you've
26:44 - got the whole website you can do a pull
26:46 - request to a json file fix a typo boom
26:49 - it's live on the website there's no you
26:51 - don't need to
26:52 - sign up test deploy server this run this
26:55 - it's just a static build website uses
26:57 - gatsby and all sorts of other
27:00 - amazing things that i don't really know
27:02 - uh so thank you to all the folks for
27:04 - doing the work so um you can see here
27:06 - first of all you can help to build out
27:08 - the content by adding if maybe i forgot
27:10 - to include a link to some reference that
27:12 - was in the video it goes right here
27:14 - but this is hard to see now but um
27:17 - because there are no contributions yet
27:19 - so there's the starting the first
27:21 - contributions you do a pull request for
27:23 - that but let's go to one that already
27:24 - has some so i will just go back to
27:27 - the and oh look at the time i will go
27:29 - back to
27:30 - which one let's try the mandelbulb yeah
27:33 - showcase so i got to stop saying
27:34 - contributions showcases the word
27:38 - so so first of all uh somebody wants to
27:40 - i forgot to um add the thumbnail for um
27:44 - so this is like the thumbnail here for
27:45 - the mandelball video it's just right
27:47 - here it's just a static jpeg file in the
27:49 - directory you want to you want to make a
27:51 - nicer thumbnail for me pull request a
27:53 - new jpeg i'm not saying i'm going to
27:54 - accept any arbitrarily redesigns of
27:56 - things but that's possible and here
27:58 - under showcase you can now see that to
28:01 - add your project
28:04 - all you need to do
28:06 - is
28:07 - uh create a json file it's a little this
28:10 - is a little bit clunky but um and
28:13 - obviously having the form might smooth
28:15 - some of this out but basically if i'm
28:17 - here i'm going to create a pull request
28:19 - with a file called contribution2.json
28:23 - um because they basically they're
28:25 - numbered and the numbers are arbitrary
28:27 - but that's the next one i wonder if it
28:28 - works if it's just any json file in its
28:30 - directory so you could like do it with
28:32 - your name but for now
28:34 - i'm like talking this through and
28:35 - thinking about it at the time basically
28:37 - you want to create a json file that's
28:38 - contribution too you can see what's in
28:40 - this json file you just need a title an
28:43 - author a name a url the url for the
28:45 - project and optionally uh source code so
28:48 - if you create this
28:49 - uh in a pull request a new file
28:52 - and by the way i can show i don't have
28:53 - time to walk you through this this is
28:55 - what i'll do in the next time i come
28:56 - back and do a live stream about this
28:59 - and then also if you create a jpeg or
29:01 - png with the same file name
29:04 - that will be your thumbnail that will
29:07 - show up with your contribution on the
29:09 - website so now we can see we can see
29:10 - that this is here and if i go to
29:13 - back to videos challenges
29:16 - and i go to the mandelbulb one
29:19 - we'll see here there is kathy's
29:22 - right here three color mandelbulb
29:25 - that was submitted to the passenger
29:27 - showcase so and if i click here right on
29:29 - this little play it'll take me to their
29:32 - project look at that amazing look at
29:34 - this by the way holy smokes nice job
29:38 - that is really really cool so there's
29:40 - more that i want to say about this what
29:42 - i'm going to do right but but i'm kind
29:43 - of i need to wrap up now because i got
29:45 - to send you over to the itp show so i'm
29:47 - going to do a couple things one is i'm
29:48 - going to grab this link here
29:51 - i'm going to go to the coding train
29:53 - discord so if you're not in the coding
29:55 - training discord
29:57 - somebody put that link into the chat
30:02 - and
30:03 - [Music]
30:05 - then i'm sorry i'm reading the chat and
30:07 - confused there's i guess there's some
30:08 - youtube twitch discussion going on oh i
30:10 - forgot to turn one of my lights on am i
30:12 - kind of dark today i don't know um but
30:14 - okay so on in the coding train discord
30:16 - which you can find by going to
30:17 - thecodingtrain.com
30:19 - discord i have to make sure that
30:21 - little
30:22 - shortcut url makes its way over to the
30:24 - new site um
30:25 - i i have under here under live a channel
30:28 - called links where i'll sort of post
30:29 - stuff when i'm doing a live stream
30:31 - so um let me post
30:33 - this is the link to the new website
30:35 - github repository
30:37 - you can download the entire thing it's
30:40 - actually if i just quickly go here
30:43 - all you need to do is run it is download
30:46 - the whole repo you have to have node
30:48 - installed on your computer if you run
30:49 - npm install and npm run dev then you'll
30:52 - actually be running the website the full
30:54 - website you don't need to connect to a
30:55 - database authenticate to anything
30:57 - everything that's on the website is in
30:59 - this repo it's a static build website
31:01 - which is very important to me as part of
31:03 - this process to sort of bring the
31:05 - community in
31:06 - um
31:09 - and then you can you can see it locally
31:11 - so if you could you want to play around
31:12 - the website locally yourself you can do
31:14 - that as well
31:15 - okay
31:16 - um this is a nice tip by the way i'm
31:19 - always running into issues and i find
31:21 - that if i run npm run clean right like
31:23 - that also nice fix any issues i'm having
31:25 - okay
31:26 - so then uh let me get you the
31:29 - uh url
31:30 - it's coding train dash preview one thing
31:32 - that's been exciting about this is i've
31:33 - been learning how to deploy a website
31:36 - automatically
31:38 - through netlify um and uh thank you to
31:41 - um some people on twitter who've helped
31:43 - reach who i've been able to reach out to
31:45 - and get some help with getting a netlify
31:47 - um
31:48 - account set up so
31:50 - let me also put this link i'm gonna
31:52 - answer one question in the chat which is
31:55 - does daniel have a twitch i do
31:57 - uh it's coding train choo choo on twitch
31:59 - i couldn't get coding train on twitch
32:02 - codingtrain2 didn't seem right so i had
32:04 - to do coding train choo choo you know if
32:06 - you have a better idea for a twitch name
32:08 - i'm all ears um but uh what i would like
32:12 - oh so the last announcement is there is
32:14 - another coding challenge video being
32:16 - edited together right now on the wave
32:18 - function collapse algorithm at present
32:22 - it is 90 minutes long
32:25 - so it was a
32:27 - about nine hours of live streaming you
32:30 - know a lot of that was wasted time
32:31 - admittedly so maybe only about four
32:33 - hours of actual coding and editing it
32:35 - down it's about 90 minutes so i'm just
32:37 - sort of curious like would you watch a
32:39 - 90 minute i mean you're probably all
32:40 - going to say yes right now if you're the
32:42 - you know however number of people who
32:44 - are um
32:45 - just happen to be here watching or the
32:47 - core audience watching the live stream
32:49 - but anyway that's that'll be coming out
32:51 - uh soon
32:53 - okay um
32:56 - train of rainbow that's a good name all
32:58 - right so i've got to get to the main
32:59 - event here let's have a look-see
33:02 - on youtube itself
33:05 - and i'm going to go i'm i'm now looking
33:07 - at my own stream to go look at this
33:10 - stream
33:11 - and it's waiting to start
33:13 - so
33:18 - waiting
33:21 - to test
33:22 - live direct feature
33:25 - or redirect or or redirect or whatever
33:28 - it is called
33:31 - okay
33:32 - so uh here i am
33:34 - [Music]
33:35 - oh
33:36 - i'm so confused
33:38 - uh here i am waiting for the itp nyu
33:42 - stream to begin what is itp
33:46 - ima
33:47 - lo-res
33:48 - what is their spring show 2022. so first
33:51 - thing i'll do is i'm going to head over
33:53 - to itp.nyu.edu
33:56 - so itp um is a graduate program
34:01 - ima is an undergraduate program and then
34:03 - there is also this wonderful new program
34:05 - that's not so new anymore i am a low
34:07 - residency program which is a one-year
34:09 - graduate program
34:12 - and then there's also by the way coming
34:14 - up this summer this thing called itp
34:16 - camp
34:17 - um
34:18 - four-week
34:20 - creative and cooperative playground so
34:22 - you know you can read more about these
34:24 - particular programs if you're somebody
34:26 - this is not meant to be an ad for them
34:28 - whatsoever it's a place where i work
34:30 - i teach classes
34:32 - i have been there for over 20 years
34:37 - and i am currently on sabbatical for
34:39 - this year so i'm not there now um just
34:41 - to fly on the wall on the stream wall
34:44 - and every semester
34:46 - at the end of the semester the students
34:48 - get together and do a show of their work
34:50 - now this is typically been in person i
34:52 - showed my work at the itp show in
34:56 - probably the first time i did that was
34:57 - 2002 so
34:58 - exactly 20 years ago
35:01 - yeah i think that's probably my first
35:03 - show i don't think oh no i had something
35:04 - in the fall in the winter 2021 show
35:07 - anyway you don't care
35:09 - um
35:10 - so uh but with this uh with the pandemic
35:14 - uh
35:15 - the program the department the school
35:16 - was not able to have an in-person show
35:18 - the last one was winter 2019. there was
35:20 - almost one almost one sort of
35:24 - in the last december didn't happen that
35:26 - was very sad um but there's been some
35:29 - wonderful online exhibitions and
35:31 - innovations and uh researchers and
35:33 - students built uh there's a club there
35:36 - that's building this thing called yorb
35:37 - and so many exciting things for me to
35:39 - cover you can go back and find my old
35:40 - streams now
35:42 - uh but it's back
35:45 - and
35:46 - uh
35:48 - and there's going to be oh it looks like
35:50 - it's starting no
35:51 - yeah looks like oh it's starting it's
35:52 - starting okay this is exciting let's see
35:54 - if they reply to okay um so it's back um
35:57 - i have in the past i'm lost already um
36:01 - oh oh so first of all
36:03 - for the actual show apologies go to
36:05 - itp.nyu.edu
36:07 - show so this is where you can find
36:10 - documentation for all of the projects so
36:13 - every project that is in the show as
36:15 - listed here with more information the
36:17 - name of the students working on it et
36:19 - cetera et cetera i'm so curious about
36:20 - this hummingbirds project
36:22 - um
36:23 - it didn't connect but that's okay then
36:25 - maybe there's a video that didn't work
36:27 - either oh look i see a nice picture of
36:29 - it there was a two to three square foot
36:31 - insulation of a flower piece hanging
36:32 - from the ceiling to contextualize the
36:33 - way participants play with the
36:35 - hummingbird toys learn more
36:37 - and i can go so you know maybe i need to
36:41 - be logged in somehow to find that but um
36:44 - so uh so i want to encourage you to
36:45 - check out the website
36:47 - then there is also a live stream now i'm
36:50 - i'm seeing that it's still just on the
36:51 - sort of preview screen so i'm kind of
36:53 - vamping here
36:55 - so um
36:57 - i in the past have done some live
36:59 - streams from the show itself where i
37:01 - awkwardly tried to walk around with the
37:02 - microphone and like a mobile camera and
37:04 - try to get footage and you can find them
37:06 - i'm sure if we do coding train itp
37:09 - uh itp show
37:11 - and uh go to videos um you can see some
37:14 - some older ones right this is the last
37:16 - one actually into winter show 2019. i
37:20 - you know here's one that i did but this
37:22 - was a an online show
37:24 - 2018 winter show
37:26 - winter show 2020.
37:29 - yeah that was also online
37:31 - uh et cetera et cetera so so you can
37:34 - find these older compilations on on on
37:37 - maybe itp's channel or my channel
37:40 - um
37:43 - i'm sorry uh
37:45 - uh okay so i'm getting important text
37:47 - messages on my phone that i that i'm
37:50 - going to look at in a second let's see
37:51 - what's happening now with the stream
37:52 - so
37:53 - youtube you may have heard
37:56 - has a new feature i mean if you've been
37:57 - on twitch it's called a raid and it
37:59 - happens very often i'm always afraid to
38:01 - use it so i'm like oh god am i going to
38:02 - raise somebody that sounds so aggressive
38:04 - so i try as the twitch community to have
38:07 - the coding train be the friendliest
38:08 - kindest most generous raiders and
38:12 - we're just passengers on the train we're
38:13 - just getting off at a stop to visit your
38:15 - land for a bit we'll get back on our
38:17 - train we'll go on our merry way thank
38:19 - you
38:20 - um but youtube has implemented this
38:22 - feature it's called live redirect very
38:24 - catchy name i might add live redirect
38:26 - right
38:29 - and
38:30 - there's other geography lessons going on
38:31 - in the chat over there so i've enabled
38:34 - it for my account i enabled it for the
38:36 - itp account so in theory i believe
38:39 - when i hit the end stream button you
38:42 - should all be sent there automatically
38:45 - and i was kind of waiting for it to get
38:46 - started
38:47 - to see that it was live before i did
38:49 - that because i didn't want you all to go
38:50 - and then be like there's nothing here
38:51 - and then leave
38:53 - um
38:54 - so
38:55 - let's see if i can if there's any
38:57 - updates for me
38:59 - um
39:03 - okay
39:05 - um
39:07 - uh let's see in the future all right let
39:08 - me answer some questions here are
39:10 - waiting in the future will you do some
39:11 - tutorials about typography
39:14 - in p5 like the text deformation with the
39:17 - cursor okay that is a great idea i would
39:20 - very much love to do that not something
39:22 - not not something that i have a
39:23 - tremendous amount of expertise in i do
39:25 - have this is not really typography
39:27 - exactly but i have the ascii video
39:28 - coding challenge that you might enjoy
39:30 - which is a way of building up an image
39:32 - the pixels of an image with uh
39:34 - characters with letter forms i'm trying
39:36 - to think if i've done other things i've
39:37 - done a lot of videos around programming
39:39 - with text
39:41 - algorithms to generate poetry or to
39:44 - connect to different apis really detect
39:46 - but typography i will say that if you're
39:48 - interested in typography
39:50 - and code
39:52 - i would highly recommend you check out
39:54 - chrono text
40:00 - yes ariel malka ariel.chronotechs.org
40:05 - ariel has been doing this kind of work
40:07 - with
40:08 - typography and computational media for
40:10 - as long as i can remember i feel like i
40:12 - was looking at this stuff 20 years ago
40:15 - being like wow this is cool
40:17 - so i would definitely encourage you to
40:18 - check out their work and a lot of it is
40:20 - actually also not just in the english
40:22 - language or with
40:24 - you know roman characters so that's
40:26 - something that may also interest you
40:27 - depending on where you live in the world
40:29 - and if you're you know what character
40:30 - set you use personally and how you might
40:32 - um create work with that
40:34 - so um that's that's one little tip i can
40:36 - give you here let's see
40:41 - uh
40:42 - can you talk about your video on wave
40:43 - function collapse when will you publish
40:45 - the nature of code 2 book
40:47 - so i have made really good progress in
40:50 - the nature of code 2 book
40:52 - my deadline is the end of 2022.
40:55 - if there is not a new version of the
40:56 - nature of code book by the end of 2022
40:59 - you heard it here first even though i've
41:00 - said this before you're here second or
41:02 - third that's it give up there will be no
41:04 - nature of code too so i'm determined to
41:06 - make it happen i've made good progress
41:09 - i need to make a lot more progress this
41:11 - summer in order to then be able to
41:13 - finish it off next fall that's the goal
41:15 - uh raspberry pi to run processing is
41:17 - extremely laggy sorry i wish i could
41:19 - help you with that maybe come join the
41:20 - coding train discord maybe somebody
41:22 - would help uh better yet probably go to
41:24 - processing the processing forum uh
41:26 - discourse.processing.org or if you just
41:28 - go to processing.org go find your way to
41:29 - the forum ask there don't have a lot of
41:31 - experience
41:32 - with processing but it doesn't surprise
41:33 - me that it would run slow you know try
41:35 - it depends what raspberry pi you're on
41:37 - depend what you're trying to do but you
41:38 - know start small just use 100 by 100
41:40 - canvas just draw one thing in it see how
41:42 - that does and build up from there
41:45 - please make a discord tutorial so i i
41:47 - really want to make new discord bot
41:49 - tutorials it's on my list um
41:51 - i really want to make new twitter bot

42:16 - i'm sure there's a lot more that i can
42:18 - do and there's stuff that's changed but
42:19 - from what i hear
42:21 - it still kind of applies and gives you a
42:22 - good basic introduction so that's lower
42:24 - on my priority list to redo
42:27 - i kind of got myself involved in too
42:29 - many projects so
42:31 - there's not going to be a ton of new
42:32 - content until june

43:04 - this point but from what i understand it
43:06 - has i mean some apis and little things
43:08 - might have changed but the core
43:09 - principles are still
43:11 - um
43:12 - yeah ml5 and teachable machine that's
43:15 - something i would like to revisit more
43:17 - all these are great ideas uh wave

44:40 - so
45:00 - okay um
45:06 - the hundred digits of pi song creative
45:08 - coding and basic oh yeah so
45:11 - um
45:12 - essay uh s period a period who is asking
45:15 - about creative coding and basic so i've
45:16 - had a little bit of a setback
45:20 - and my um i can go to my
45:23 - twitter where you'll see updates about
45:25 - this i have been working on restoring
45:28 - uh my old apple 2 plus computer
45:33 - and
45:34 - i
45:35 - i had an issue with the power supply and
45:37 - i actually purchased a
45:39 - new power supply unit like a modern
45:42 - rebuild of it which worked great
45:45 - but now something seems to be wrong with
45:47 - the actual
45:48 - cpu or logic board or
45:51 - rom or ram or whatever these things are
45:55 - so this is what i'm stuck with right now
45:57 - you can see this is what it looks like
45:58 - i've been getting great advice online i
46:00 - actually
46:02 - just bought off ebay a replacement logic
46:05 - board
46:06 - for the apple ii plus so rather than try
46:08 - to like diagnose and repair like
46:10 - individual chips i think i'm just gonna
46:12 - try swapping out
46:14 - so that's supposed to arrive and i'll
46:16 - try swapping that out and see how far i
46:18 - get
46:18 - um
46:20 - uh
46:21 - yeah and
46:22 - um
46:24 - simon assam and chat mentioned steering
46:25 - behaviors why don't you make any nature
46:27 - of code videos in a while you know i
46:28 - just
46:30 - i'm not good at doing a lot of videos
46:31 - all the time
46:33 - so if i if i had a life where i was
46:36 - making like videos every day
46:38 - i would do a coding challenge one day i
46:41 - would be doing my discord bot the next
46:43 - day i'd do another nature of code video
46:44 - the next day maybe this summer i can get
46:47 - some more momentum going i feel like
46:48 - this has been a pretty decent year 2022
46:51 - i also have a more elaborate production
46:53 - process for better or worse i have
46:56 - talked about this before but the quality
46:57 - of the videos i think has improved
46:59 - uh i don't i don't it's a trade-off like
47:01 - maybe in the end having um less editing
47:04 - and less production value but just more
47:06 - and more stuff would be better i don't
47:07 - know the answer to that but that's
47:08 - that's really the
47:10 - the reason um
47:12 - all right let's make a video about
47:14 - quaternions i hope that's part of our
47:16 - inside joke here ah okay look at this
