00:14 - [Music]
01:26 - I'm gonna say once again coordinates
01:36 - [Music]
01:41 - coordinates
01:45 - [Music]
01:57 - and auto-tune and the internet will fix
02:00 - that
02:00 - [Music]
02:09 - coordinates
02:11 - [Music]
02:32 - hello and good morning I almost had that
02:35 - timed right I was gonna the end of that
02:37 - song crossfade into me my mic is on
02:40 - hello hello I'm trying to be somewhat
02:42 - more professional this morning with my
02:44 - opening coding train logo and some music
02:48 - which instead of be just here like is
02:51 - the is the stream starting is the stream
02:54 - starting oh wait okay hi so this was my
02:56 - to attempt let me know how it went
02:58 - welcome and good morning and well to the
03:00 - coding man shoot I was doing so well
03:03 - welcome made a good morning no it goes
03:06 - like this
03:06 - good morning and welcome to the coding
03:08 - train my name I'm your host Daniel chief
03:14 - bond and I am here every Wednesday 10:30
03:18 - a.m. Eastern to do some coding stuff and
03:21 - actually I'm really excited about today
03:23 - I recently released a few videos about
03:27 - making a gif I think by the way that
03:29 - these videos are getting tons of views
03:31 - just because people want to know whether
03:33 - how I'm gonna pronounce the word it's
03:36 - like oh I feel like I really that wasn't
03:39 - my best work either that gift loop video
03:41 - I feel like I went on and on and on at
03:43 - the beginning and then in the end it's
03:45 - just a rotating square and I could have
03:46 - done so much better
03:47 - but alas people seem to be enjoying it
03:50 - and watching it if you go on to Twitter
03:53 - and go to a hashtag gift train gift
03:58 - train gift train because these gifts are
04:00 - little gifts you know hearts out into
04:04 - the world if you go to gift gift train
04:07 - you can see I'm just gonna go to latest
04:09 - here wait a second I'm a little bit
04:12 - afraid to click on this one I'm sure
04:15 - it's fine but you can see that people
04:18 - are sharing gifts that they've made and
04:22 - I hope to see more of these this is a
04:24 - pretty interesting one by the composer
04:28 - of the Iowa refactor this later song
04:31 - [Music]
04:40 - so please continue to share those in
04:42 - addition to sharing on Twitter or I
04:44 - suppose if I ever got around to using
04:46 - Instagram could share stuff with me you
04:50 - know I have this hi this whole thing
04:52 - where I was gonna switch over to using
04:53 - mastodons and somehow I never was able
04:55 - to make that really happen but maybe
04:58 - I'll give that another try
05:00 - but no no that's spoiler alert okay I
05:03 - also you can also share things on the
05:06 - coding train website itself here are for
05:09 - heart submissions that I will now share
05:13 - with you the first one I will share with
05:14 - you is love hearts by unrig Ezra so I
05:21 - guess I can click and everywhere I click
05:24 - it makes a heart whoo look at this and
05:27 - they're like oh oh it's like X tracing
05:31 - its contours more and more this is
05:33 - beautiful excellent work I love it
05:36 - let's look at the changing the Cassini
05:38 - oval to a heart by Simon a different
05:41 - Simon then the usual coding train viewer
05:45 - Simon Tiger ah look at that
05:46 - I love that another beating heart I'm
05:49 - gonna make I'm gonna make more coding
05:51 - challenges with like hearts and stars
05:52 - and rainbows and things like that but
05:54 - just it brings me such happiness and joy
05:56 - okay that's beautiful work
05:59 - rainbow heart excellent use of the
06:02 - combining of the rainbow with the heart
06:04 - together let's click on this this is by
06:07 - Ria's Lockhart laaskar here comes it's
06:12 - falling from the sky oh it's coming from
06:13 - the sides I think this one needs
06:16 - [Music]
06:25 - that's beautiful I love this I love the
06:28 - creative use the way people are using
06:30 - this sort of path of that formula the
06:32 - heart curve creatively and having it be
06:34 - the boundaries of the basically a
06:35 - particle system that's coming in really
06:38 - nice work and let's look at one more
06:40 - heartbeat by copper of France and here
06:45 - we go look at that that is really cool
06:49 - so this is look at this so you can see
06:51 - the cardioid shape and the particular
06:54 - heart curve there and you can see it's
06:56 - from beating back and forth between the
06:58 - two of them and this also is a wonderful
07:00 - this is a wonderful reference to a
07:07 - wonderful allusion to the circled square
07:10 - shape morphing coding challenge that a
07:14 - golden Levant presented on this channel
07:15 - here so you can see this is more thing
07:17 - between two shapes the heart shape and
07:19 - the cardioid shape see me sad to move
07:21 - away from hearts today we're gonna have
07:23 - to keep the heart we're gonna have to
07:24 - keep the heart thing going alright so
07:28 - thanks everyone for joining I'm gonna
07:31 - get I'm gonna try to not have too much
07:36 - exposition and just get right to the
07:38 - coding because I am so excited about
07:40 - this topic that I'm gonna do today if
07:42 - this happened spontaneously as if in a
07:46 - dream to me and yet it yet it's
07:49 - something that's been around for quite a
07:51 - while that people have been using as a
07:52 - technique and I I would say a pioneer of
07:54 - this technique is Etienne Jacob Etienne
07:58 - Jacob I don't know how to say the last
07:59 - name in French and you can see this I
08:02 - don't know that this was made based on
08:05 - the fact that I did a heart curve coding
08:08 - challenge I can only just be I can I can
08:13 - be somewhat semi confident suspicious
08:20 - that maybe it is somewhat and partially
08:22 - and a little bit inspired by my coding
08:24 - challenge simply by the date of February
08:26 - 15th given that I did the coding
08:28 - challenge on I think February 13th was
08:31 - my live stream last week because today
08:33 - is February 20th but what I want you to
08:36 - look at this and I want what I want
08:38 - YouTube look what I want what really
08:40 - blows my mind about this it might not be
08:42 - immediately apparent to you is this is
08:45 - not a processing sketch a p5 sketch
08:48 - running presumably it might have been
08:49 - created with one of those things but it
08:51 - is in fact a gift there is a little bit
08:56 - of it what's amazing about this is
08:58 - there's a lot of randomness and
09:01 - randomness of this in this gift
09:03 - it seems chaotic and random and yet
09:06 - somehow it loops seamlessly although now
09:09 - that I look at it I see this like slight
09:11 - moment of a jump but we can look more
09:14 - and more at Etsy ons Twitter feed let's
09:16 - look at this one similar idea but this
09:20 - is a gift it is looping over and over
09:23 - again how I talked about in my gift
09:26 - looping challenge that the end point of
09:30 - a gift the last frame of a gif if it
09:33 - matches with the first frame it will
09:36 - appear seamless but how do you have
09:38 - something that's so random and chaotic
09:40 - and yet somehow accidentally or by
09:43 - design and with a frame at the end that
09:46 - matches the one from the beginning and
09:47 - this is exactly what I will present to
09:50 - you today in a coding challenge about
09:53 - creating a Perlin noise loop so before I
09:56 - keep going and talk too much about this
09:58 - let me there so this is another
10:01 - reference this is I think even more
10:02 - salient here like this is particularly
10:05 - like how in the world is this looping
10:07 - how is that looping now the answer to
10:11 - this is if you read at tiens article
10:13 - here all about Perlin noise functions
10:15 - and this particular technique for how to
10:17 - animate noisy stuff with a nice trick so
10:20 - I'm gonna present to you my own way of
10:22 - doing this which I suspect is exactly
10:24 - what's in there considering about this I
10:26 - think I read this article probably in
10:28 - 2017 when it came out
10:30 - and then somehow yesterday in the middle
10:33 - of class at ITP
10:34 - I was like this new idea and then I was
10:38 - I messaged goal 11 about it I was like
10:40 - did this new idea he's like uh-huh yeah
10:43 - by the way this is my p5.js sketch that
10:45 - I made I suspect you like but year ago
10:48 - or six months ago that does exactly that
10:49 - so clearly I didn't invent that I just
10:51 - thought that I did I had
10:52 - remembered something but I'm gonna go
10:54 - through this with you today and it's I'm
10:55 - so excited about it cuz it's really
10:58 - gonna change for its I think it's gonna
11:00 - open up a lot of interesting and unique
11:02 - creative possibilities for you and you
11:04 - can make hearts and rainbows with it and
11:09 - of course we're gonna need
11:11 - polar to Cartesian coordinate
11:15 - transformations
11:19 - ah I think I did show David snipe
11:25 - Snyder's 4ei heart gift but let me just
11:28 - make sure to give this a nice highlight
11:30 - because this is what I love something
11:33 - that I absolutely love the most is when
11:34 - I see different bits of code and
11:37 - examples that I've made get combined and
11:39 - recombined in unique and interesting
11:40 - ways and here is a nice ode to
11:43 - Valentine's Day with the heart curve and
11:45 - the Fourier transform by David Schneider
11:48 - hashtag gift train okay and now oh no oh
11:59 - I wanted to keep that up let's put that
12:02 - here I think I'm gonna attempt to do
12:04 - this in the p5 web editor even though
12:07 - there is a somewhat significant bug that
12:11 - you are all aware of if you've watched
12:13 - my what video did I experience that in
12:16 - the bouncing DVD logo let's make this is
12:22 - that okay too big too small I'll move
12:28 - this over a tiny bit question is I think
12:38 - I would like this to be a little bit
12:40 - bigger and if I do wait 600 600
12:47 - auto-refresh
12:49 - zero let's make this I know the camera
12:53 - went off I have a I'm on a path to
12:57 - fixing this camera issue don't worry
12:59 - everything is gonna change for the
13:02 - coding train in the future ah welcome
13:06 - new member cryptic so by the way if you
13:09 - like what I do there's no requirement to
13:12 - do this I will mention there is an
13:13 - opportunity to join as a YouTube member
13:16 - I also have a patreon I'm not so sure
13:17 - about the patreon try to figure out what
13:19 - to do about that but you will get an
13:23 - invite to a slack channel I will at some
13:25 - point you know some amount of time mail
13:27 - you some stickers and you will also have
13:29 - my
13:30 - so thank you to new member you get a
13:33 - little fancy icon so I don't know
13:34 - anybody in the chat who's a member
13:36 - I'm just curious but your icon changes
13:40 - your little emoji icon changes based on
13:41 - how long you've been as a member and I
13:43 - can't remember what I think the dot that
13:44 - this dot character is the first one and
13:46 - I think the rainbow is the last one
13:48 - maybe I've had to be a member for two
13:49 - years or something so I can't imagine I
13:50 - don't even had it for that long but I'm
13:52 - curious to see what those what those I
13:56 - set them up at one point alright so I
13:59 - think I think all right so is that okay
14:18 - this font size is that visible and think
14:22 - about think about all of the people
14:23 - around the world who are like on there
14:26 - on the bus or the subway on their way to
14:29 - work or school with their little tiny
14:31 - mobile device watching the coding train
14:32 - and they read my code all right
14:44 - so this is gonna be a coding challenge
14:47 - it's going to relate to a lot of
14:49 - different things so the two things that
14:53 - I want to mention are blobby this also
15:06 - relates to this and Perlin noise
15:12 - playlist coding train mmm what's gonna
15:23 - happen here okay hold on a second just
15:26 - give me a second here I want to be
15:29 - logged in as a different person one of
15:34 - these days I'll fix this it's fine
15:38 - just give me a second here everybody
15:41 - just just purl in yeah this is where I
15:48 - have a Perlin noise playlist ah there it
15:52 - is oh yeah okay
15:58 - uh-huh there we go all right so I don't
16:07 - know I think I'm gonna start with this
16:10 - what's one of them these are amazing by
16:12 - the way
16:12 - I mean look at that
16:17 - I don't think I should lead with this
16:19 - because this is misleading I'm never
16:21 - gonna create anything so beautiful as a
16:24 - TN Jacobs but I think oh yeah this this
16:27 - this is definitely related to what I
16:29 - want to do and where's the heart okay
16:46 - here we go
16:47 - alright this I can lead with I need to
16:52 - make sure I have a white board working
16:54 - white board this this this is no good
17:00 - I've got three markers here David in the
17:06 - slack channel asks Dan do you think
17:09 - you'll ever make a 3d version of blobby
17:11 - I've been trying it since I saw the
17:12 - blobby video and I can't figure it out
17:14 - oh I like this idea yes in fact we
17:19 - should make a three I mean you would
17:21 - need the spherical geometry coding
17:23 - challenge so the spherical geometry
17:26 - coding challenge combined with the
17:29 - blobby coding challenge is the path to
17:31 - do this and I would love to do that
17:33 - that's a great idea okay wait trying to
17:38 - find a marker that will do us justice
17:45 - haha I think I have found this is the
17:49 - marker which will be the marker for
17:52 - today how are we doing on glare let's
17:54 - see
17:55 - that's not causing the glare is it this
17:59 - one that's definitely the glare that's
18:03 - better
18:05 - okay let's make sure this works
18:10 - Oh oh that was the saddest thing ever
18:13 - you know you'd think somebody who has a
18:17 - YouTube channel is like hundreds of
18:19 - thousands of subscribers would bother to
18:22 - find a marker before going why and yet I
18:27 - can't seem to manage to get myself to do
18:29 - this fortunately for me I have a box
18:31 - here and this box you can't see it is
18:37 - full of markers we're gonna find one I
18:41 - need what I need is another box that's
18:44 - full of markers that are used up no I
18:49 - can tell already
18:54 - okay promising very promising ah there
19:01 - we go no this one will do the job
19:03 - polar noise loops this is the topic for
19:15 - right now by the way incidentally it's
19:19 - also my intention to talk about
19:21 - JavaScript inheritance with prototypes
19:25 - and es6 classes so that'll be the that's
19:30 - gonna be the boring stuff that comes
19:31 - later I mean I don't know what's boring
19:33 - and what's not boring but that's gonna
19:35 - come later okay let's make sure this
19:39 - camera has got a half an hour of
19:43 - possibilities
19:51 - by the way I've just decided I'm not
19:54 - bothering with slow-mo anymore with the
19:56 - chat somebody in yes it's the spherical
20:01 - and coordinate polar song mmm
20:05 - thank you okay we c'mon for that
20:07 - suggestion I have I I haven't remembered
20:12 - in recent weeks to put slowmode on in
20:14 - the chat and so now I'm kind of leaving
20:17 - it without slowmode in the hopes that
20:19 - the community and my my continuous
20:23 - presentation of hearts will keep the
20:26 - chat under control but plea is if it
20:29 - becomes unwieldy or a problem for anyone
20:31 - let me know in particular those of you
20:34 - who are in the patreon YouTube member
20:37 - slack group you can let me know if you
20:39 - need me to turn on slow mode yes I am
20:49 - calling this polar noise loops
20:53 - welcome to the Polar Express I don't
21:05 - know if that's a good name for it but
21:06 - that's what I'm calling it
21:07 - alright let's let's get this started
21:16 - time to do some coding hello okay I knew
21:28 - something went wrong hold on
21:32 - zanny dolly pee in the chat asks hey is
21:36 - there a fixed time when he goes live and
21:39 - in fact there has never historically
21:41 - been affixed time but there is a fixed
21:43 - time now and that fixed time is right
21:46 - now
21:46 - every Wednesday 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time
21:51 - shoot my mic clip is kind of broken
21:55 - hopefully this is going to hold I think
21:59 - it's going to be okay
22:03 - let's try that again tissues and I'm
22:12 - ready to go I think I better start
22:15 - treating the livestreams as actual
22:17 - like time on the Internet in video
22:19 - supposed to just like oh I'm not really
22:21 - because it's not part of the thing
22:22 - that'll edit for later but whatever
22:24 - hello and welcome to a coding challenge
22:26 - who if you can't tell about this one so
22:30 - I found this gift the other day by a
22:33 - tian jacoba at john jacob with my
22:37 - american pronunciation and look at it
22:39 - look familiar to you it looks like a
22:42 - heart curve that I made in a coding
22:44 - challenge previously now I can't say for
22:45 - sure whether this gift was made based on
22:47 - my heart curve coding challenge but I
22:50 - can say for sure that the work of a Tian
22:52 - is amazing and phenomenal and uses a
22:54 - special technique one that I have
22:57 - recently rediscovered in a dream it came
22:59 - to me through dream and yet it's been on
23:01 - the Internet at least since 2017 if not
23:04 - before that so what's going on here
23:05 - that's so fabulous and exciting is this
23:07 - chaotic scene this scene of randomness
23:11 - and smoky heart beauty beauty is
23:13 - actually a perfect gift loop how is it
23:17 - that the end matches the beginning and
23:19 - this is something I talked about in my
23:21 - previous coding challenge gift loop
23:22 - where we looked at okay well we can move
23:24 - something across the window we can
23:26 - rotate something and as long as the last
23:28 - frame matches up with the first frame it
23:30 - will loop but if it's all random and
23:32 - chaotic how do you do that and so there
23:35 - is a technique for doing this Golan
23:37 - Levin actually also has an example bit
23:39 - of code which describes this in more
23:41 - detail which I will show you later in
23:43 - this video but mostly what I want to do
23:45 - is highlight to you this blog post from
23:48 - necessary disorder etienne from November
23:51 - 15 2017 which explains this technique of
23:55 - creating gifts like this here's another
23:57 - one how could this even possibly work
24:00 - and so to begin this discussion I mean
24:03 - hopefully we're gonna get to a lot
24:04 - something I could probably make videos
24:05 - on this topic for the rest of my life
24:08 - but to begin this topic I'm gonna return
24:10 - to a previous coding challenge you may
24:14 - remember me from coding challenges
24:16 - as Kotick challenge number 36 blobby
24:19 - it's when I used to wear t-shirts with
24:21 - this other logo on them to bring my
24:23 - coding challenges and by the way see
24:26 - more gray hair there but I think it's
24:28 - the lighting or something cuz I once
24:29 - asked me if I dye my hair and I do not
24:31 - but maybe I should I have no idea
24:32 - anyways that's not important I'm
24:35 - probably not gonna get edited out you've
24:36 - no chin and yeah okay so what is the
24:41 - issue with blobby
24:42 - so I'm actually even though I could just
24:44 - pull up that code I'm gonna speed code
24:46 - blobby again
24:47 - you're gonna see watch this is like two
24:49 - coding challenges in one so I'm going to
24:51 - what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna say
24:55 - let a equals zero a is less than 2pi I'm
25:03 - gonna turn off auto refresh for a second
25:05 - I'm working in the p5.js web editor
25:08 - which I think goes be a good
25:09 - demonstration of this and then I this is
25:14 - supposed to say for I got so what I'm
25:16 - doing here just in case you're wondering
25:18 - as I'm writing a little for loop and
25:19 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
25:21 - my polar to Cartesian coordinate song
25:23 - and I'm going to say let X equal R times
25:27 - cosine of that angle let y equal R times
25:31 - sine of that angle and then I'm going to
25:34 - I'm going to make up some value of R R
25:38 - is going to be 100 I'm gonna translate
25:40 - to the center of the window and then I
25:45 - am going to say begin shape I am gonna
25:48 - say n shape and I'm gonna set a vertex
25:52 - vertex at X Y and I'm gonna say and I
25:57 - spelled to pipe is of zero which is
25:59 - really complaining I mean to say a
26:02 - stroke to 55 and no fill and there we go
26:06 - look I just wrote the code for drawing a
26:09 - circle because this is a for loop I'm
26:11 - gonna go through all these different
26:12 - angles I'm gonna calculate I'm gonna
26:14 - chain I'm gonna increment the angle I'm
26:16 - gonna keep the radius constant and I'm
26:17 - gonna set all the vertices XY another
26:20 - circle now if R is random and this is
26:22 - basically what I did in blobby if I say
26:24 - random 50 to 100 look what we've got
26:26 - we've got this kind of
26:28 - crazy flickering thing that's almost
26:30 - that's kind of interesting
26:31 - onto itself and I could make this a
26:33 - little more evident by making the time
26:35 - step did not the time step the the delta
26:38 - angle the amount of angle at the amount
26:40 - of vertices I'm drawing fewer I could
26:43 - make sure it connects at the end by
26:44 - saying close and I could also just for
26:47 - right now say no loop so we only get one
26:50 - of them so each time I run this sketch
26:52 - I'm getting it a new random pattern now
26:55 - here's the thing this actually looks
26:56 - like it's a nice closed loop because
26:58 - it's all random it doesn't matter if the
27:00 - last vertex doesn't match up with the
27:02 - first vertex and I you know it would be
27:04 - somewhat smart of me to be more
27:06 - thoughtful about what this Delta angle
27:08 - is like maybe it should be something
27:10 - that divides perfectly into two pi or
27:12 - the radians equivalent of 360 degrees
27:15 - but again I'm not going to worry about
27:16 - that what I'm going to do is I'm now
27:18 - going to add perla noise to this now if
27:20 - you've never heard of Perlin noise
27:21 - before I will refer you to a playlist
27:23 - where I talk about what Perlin noise is
27:24 - and how it works and a whole bunch of
27:26 - other videos related to this so go and
27:29 - watch those now if you want or also link
27:31 - to some articles about perla noise but
27:33 - i'm gonna assume knowledge of Perlin
27:35 - noise for the purpose of this this
27:36 - coding challenge so right now what I'm
27:38 - gonna do is I'm gonna say let T equal 0
27:41 - so I'm gonna use T as my offset through
27:44 - the one-dimensional Perlin noise space
27:46 - I'm gonna change that to X offset and a
27:48 - little bit but let's just keep it at E
27:49 - right now then I'm going to say R is
27:52 - noise of T times 100 so interestingly
27:58 - enough let me we get a different size
28:01 - circle every time I run the sketch
28:03 - because we're getting a new randomly
28:07 - seeded set of Perlin noise values and
28:11 - the I'm never moving through that time
28:14 - space so each vertex is exactly the same
28:16 - so what I want to do now is say in the
28:20 - loop T plus equal some amount of Delta
28:23 - so now you can see look at this the
28:26 - amount is changing but it doesn't match
28:28 - up so first of all let me clean this up
28:30 - a little bit by saying Matt let me use
28:32 - the map function which I think is it it
28:34 - will make things a little simpler Perlin
28:36 - noise always has a range between 0 and 1
28:37 - and let's say I want that range to go
28:39 - between
28:40 - like 100 and 200 now so we can see look
28:42 - at that now there's just this little
28:44 - every time I run it you can see that the
28:47 - last Perlin noise value doesn't match
28:49 - the first one this is the problem this
28:51 - is getting at this idea of a perfect
28:53 - Perlin noise loop and let's also have
28:57 - delta T the amount way I moved through
28:59 - the Perlin noise space Ceri what chu
29:03 - Delta TB tumbleweeds can we have like a
29:07 - tumbleweed animation and like the
29:09 - crickets sound effect right that would
29:11 - be great alright so let me change that
29:13 - to this and you can see even if I move T
29:16 - faster and I get this kind of smooth or
29:19 - blobby like shape it always has this
29:21 - artifact the last and by the way if I
29:23 - took off this clothes this will be more
29:25 - evident why right the last vertex
29:28 - doesn't match up with the first one this
29:30 - is the problem so how are we gonna solve
29:33 - fruit so why why does this happen so I
29:37 - have my title of this video right here
29:39 - Perlin noise loops curly noise if we're
29:43 - talking about one-dimensional Perlin
29:45 - noise Perlin noise values in a
29:47 - one-dimensional space with this being
29:51 - the T access the time access although
29:53 - really I should call this like X offset
29:55 - because it's like the X at offset this
29:58 - is maybe a graph of those values and if
30:01 - I'm arbitrarily going from zero to some
30:04 - fixed end point as I get to the end of
30:06 - that circle whatever value I'd get here
30:08 - which maybe let's say if this is between
30:10 - leg 0 and 1 maybe this is zero point 3
30:13 - and this is like zero point 6 to 1 right
30:17 - they don't match up if I were to take
30:20 - this and twist it around into a circle
30:21 - they don't match up there is another way
30:25 - to look at a space of Perlin noise
30:27 - values this is a way of looking at it in
30:29 - one dimension let's now look at it in
30:32 - two dimensions so instead of having a
30:35 - sort of one-dimensional graph of Perlin
30:39 - noise values i present to you a grid of
30:43 - Perlin noise values now if we think of
30:45 - this grid as fairly like low resolution
30:47 - and I'm gonna draw
30:50 - I don't know why I made those dotted
30:52 - lines like this is like basically a 5x5
30:55 - grid right now if I if I did my drawing
30:58 - correctly the idea is right each one of
31:00 - these represents some value between 0 &
31:03 - 1
31:03 - now in this 2 dimensional space each one
31:07 - of these values represents all is also a
31:09 - number between 0 & 1 so I might have
31:10 - like point 2 here point 3 here and point
31:13 - 3 1 here and point 2 6 here and point 1
31:15 - 9 here right every single space has a
31:18 - value now here in one dimension any
31:21 - number in one dimensional space is quite
31:23 - similar to its neighbors and it only has
31:25 - two neighbors a neighbor on the left and
31:27 - a neighbor on the right or a neighbor
31:28 - after a neighbor before here each value
31:31 - has how many neighbors 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
31:35 - it has neighbors above and neighbors
31:37 - below and neighbors to the right and
31:39 - neighbor diagonally down so the idea
31:41 - here is that what if I could walk around
31:47 - through a 2-dimensional Perlin noise to
31:49 - get space to get random values and
31:51 - always end up back where I started and
31:55 - why not just walk in a circular path I
31:57 - mean that's kind of what I programming
31:58 - anyway so why not just do that what if I
32:01 - were to start here and get this Perlin
32:03 - noise value then this one then this one
32:05 - then this one then this one then this
32:07 - one then this one then this one then
32:08 - this one then this wasn't more than this
32:10 - one then this one and this one I would
32:11 - have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
32:17 - random numbers and the last one is going
32:21 - to match up with the first one if I keep
32:23 - going so I could get those those random
32:26 - numbers over and over again and if that
32:27 - if there's an amount of numbers there is
32:28 - so vast it's going to appear like it is
32:30 - a continuous sequence of total
32:32 - randomness smooth with perla noise so
32:34 - this is the theory so let's now go and
32:36 - apply this theory to this particular
32:40 - blobby shape
32:51 - sorry there is I see a siren going off
32:54 - alert polar noise on the whiteboard what
32:58 - does that mean yeah I should play the
33:05 - Perlin noise song I also see in the chat
33:11 - that temp name is saying voice and video
33:13 - get more and more distinct over time I
33:16 - don't know how to resolve that what I
33:20 - can tell you is that I do correct for
33:23 - that after the fact so everything that I
33:25 - do in today's lives for the full
33:27 - livestream ends up archived on YouTube
33:29 - forever I mean until the world ends and
33:33 - there's a lot of reasons why that might
33:35 - happen sooner than later but anyway that
33:37 - aside or it's probably more like that
33:41 - YouTube won't exist before the world
33:42 - ends but anyway I don't what this is not
33:44 - this is not the discussion but oh but
33:49 - then I also edit out chunks and those do
33:52 - not and and and resync the audio if
33:55 - necessary several people are typing I
33:58 - just want to know what the what the
34:00 - alert symbol and polar noise on the
34:02 - whiteboard question mark question mark
34:04 - if that was some sort of issue that I'm
34:06 - oh yes no I wrote into polar noise on
34:12 - purpose
34:14 - got it I wrote it as polar noise on
34:17 - purpose I mean it should say polar
34:22 - pearling I don't know if you can did I
34:25 - write that out of you mostly yes I wrote
34:28 - it as polar on purpose even it's a term
34:31 - that I made up that probably means
34:32 - nothing and is terribly misleading and
34:34 - everybody wants to complain alright I
34:37 - see
34:44 - are we all satisfied now okay poor Simon
34:56 - through the chat rightz
34:57 - poorly no ease that's actually really
34:59 - good why isn't it isn't it
35:02 - poor our pearl our maybe it's pearl our
35:05 - noise anyway okay alright so actually
35:17 - before I come back here I want to let me
35:24 - just open up processing real quick it's
35:27 - the pull
35:36 - just want to grab something real quick
35:39 - which is just give me a second here what
35:49 - am I looking for not pixel flow I'm
35:52 - looking for math basics this is another
35:55 - basics math Noyce 2d there we go okay
36:02 - interesting
36:04 - let me let me comment this out there we
36:10 - go
36:23 - might as well cycle the cameras while
36:29 - I'm here taking a short break from the
36:33 - actual content and now I'm coming back
36:46 - so coming back to the computer what I've
36:49 - opened up here is a processing sketch
36:51 - that is visualizing pearl and noise in a
36:54 - 2d space so this is showing you a sort
36:56 - of the classic visualization of exactly
36:59 - this idea and in that visualization each
37:02 - number a number between 0 & 1 is mapped
37:04 - to a pixel brightness so here you see
37:07 - [Music]
37:15 - let's try that again
37:17 - I really shouldn't put the soundboard so
37:19 - close to my keyboard where I switch the
37:21 - camera let me just go back all the way
37:25 - because that was alright so before I get
37:32 - back to the blobby code what I have here
37:34 - is a processing sketch that is
37:36 - visualizing Perlin noise in a two
37:38 - dimensional space so this is a pretty
37:39 - sort of like classic visualization of 2d
37:42 - perla noise as this cloudy like texture
37:45 - and this is literally exactly this where
37:49 - each number each random Perlin noise
37:52 - value in the two dimensional space is
37:55 - represented as a pixel with a brightness
37:57 - value between 0 and 255 and when you
38:00 - look at that you get this cloud like
38:02 - pattern because the color seamlessly
38:05 - smoothly moves between white to black to
38:08 - gray to black to gray to white so the
38:10 - idea here is what is what I want to do
38:13 - is walk around this space and pull those
38:16 - numeric values but map them to something
38:18 - else besides a pixel value and walking
38:20 - around in a circle is a nice way to
38:22 - create a loop but you don't necessarily
38:24 - have to have that be in a circle all
38:27 - right so let's go back to the blobby
38:28 - code now there's a little is a bit
38:30 - confusing about this because in addition
38:31 - to the walking around the Perlin noise
38:33 - space in a circular path I also happen
38:36 - to be walking around the 2d canvas and
38:38 - circular path to draw this circular
38:41 - shape so I'm kind of using the same idea
38:44 - but with two different points of view
38:46 - and hopefully that is something that
38:48 - makes sense to you okay so what I want
38:53 - to change this is I no longer want to
38:55 - have T what I want to have is X offset
39:00 - I'm gonna say I want to have an X offset
39:05 - and a Y offset and I want to get the
39:09 - Perlin noise at x offset Y offset okay
39:13 - now T is not T is not T is not where do
39:17 - I have T cell ah T is moving up let's
39:20 - took that up okay so this is now what I
39:24 - had before
39:24 - if the pearl if the axe offset in the Y
39:27 - offset right basically if what I'm doing
39:29 - is I'm asking for what is the Perlin
39:33 - noise value at this spot it's gonna give
39:37 - me some random value and then I'm gonna
39:39 - make that the radius of the circle the
39:41 - blob shape as it goes all the way around
39:43 - so I want to start moving but I actually
39:45 - don't want to start here I want to start
39:46 - over here so I have to deal with the
39:48 - fact that I the that I need to find this
39:51 - point if zero zero is in the top left
39:53 - because I can't have negative values in
39:55 - the purlins oi space so this is a little
39:56 - bit of a tricky piece of this but I want
39:58 - to use that same puller to Cartesian
40:01 - coordinate formula or I want to say X
40:03 - offset equals cosine of that angle y
40:06 - offset equals sine of that angle now
40:08 - look at this I kind of got something but
40:11 - it's weirdly symmetrical and the reason
40:14 - is this is exactly what I just alluded
40:16 - to I these X offset and Y offset values
40:19 - are going between negative 1 and 1 and
40:22 - so in fact I'm trying to look at Perlin
40:24 - noise values over here right and these
40:29 - this doesn't exist the Perlin noise face
40:31 - is all positive so there's actually a
40:33 - very simple solution to this which is
40:35 - just to add one like that and suddenly
40:40 - whoo yeah I think so and let me add the
40:42 - clothes back in and let's run this a
40:46 - bunch of times and we can see there we
40:47 - go we have this nice random blobby shape
40:50 - where the N matches the beginning now I
40:53 - want to do let's do some more stuff here
40:55 - all right so first of all I am where
41:00 - what happened to that like incrementer
41:02 - what happened to t plus equal point 0 1
41:06 - now I have X offset and wife said why
41:08 - aren't I saying X offset plus equal one
41:10 - point one y offset plus you go on one
41:13 - well actually the incrementer is this it
41:16 - is the point 1 here it's cosine of the
41:19 - angle and in truth I could have a
41:23 - separate variable from the one that's
41:26 - incrementing in the loop because I could
41:28 - move through but but but I need to go
41:30 - all the way to 2 pi so that that I don't
41:32 - want to do I think a way for me to bury
41:33 - this in a more flexible way is actually
41:35 - to use the map function so if I map
41:38 - cosine of a which goes between negative
41:40 - 1 and 1 and then map that to a range
41:44 - between 0 and 2 we have and this is sine
41:49 - we have exactly what I had before and I
41:52 - can keep I can keep rewriting the sketch
41:56 - I'm getting a new a new version of the
41:58 - shape but interestingly enough what
42:00 - happens this is really now something
42:03 - that I should make a parameter so for
42:05 - example what if I were to say let I'm
42:08 - gonna make this a global variable let
42:10 - I'm gonna call this noise max equal to
42:13 - and I'm gonna put this here
42:16 - and watch what happens if I make this 5
42:19 - versus 10 versus 28 versus 0.1 and look
42:26 - at this 0.3 0.5 look at this this is
42:30 - really kind of interesting with just a
42:33 - little bit of noise I have what appears
42:36 - almost like a perfect circle but it kind
42:38 - of looks like a human being like me with
42:42 - faults I have lots of faults drew that
42:44 - circle it's got some slight so Perla
42:47 - noise can actually use as a nice way
42:49 - with a little subtle perla noise of
42:50 - making some perfect shape like a letter
42:53 - form or a circle or a square
42:54 - have a little bit of wiggle to it that
42:56 - makes it seem more hand-drawn so that's
42:58 - a nice thing to see the other thing we
43:00 - could see here very quickly is like you
43:02 - know it would make sense for me to
43:04 - create a slider I'm gonna say and this
43:09 - I'm using the p5 Dom library to do this
43:10 - which is a really quick way I'm gonna
43:12 - create a slider which has a range
43:13 - between like 0.1 and 10 and I'm gonna
43:17 - start it at 0 actually let's make it
43:19 - between 0 and 10 I'm gonna start it at 0
43:22 - so I have the slider here now and then I
43:25 - want noise max to equal noise max to
43:30 - equal slider value so watch this okay
43:36 - that didn't work create slider the range
43:41 - goes between
43:42 - zero and tenth hold on a sec let's take
43:44 - this out oh I have no loop in here no
43:50 - wonder
43:50 - take out the no loop and now let me
43:52 - slide it we need to make that so first
43:56 - of all I need to give myself smaller
43:58 - time steps when moving the slider so
44:01 - let's do this oh look how it kind of
44:04 - like unfurls because it's the same noise
44:07 - space I'm just stretching or shrinking
44:09 - it that is a really and imagine now if I
44:12 - isolated that like a long a sine wave
44:14 - I've had it super interesting and I
44:16 - could also make I just out of curiosity
44:17 - could make this go to like 100 I should
44:19 - make it go to 11 so happy if it goes to
44:22 - 11 but really it should go to like a
44:23 - hundred and eleven and watch this I
44:26 - guess it's hard to detect that
44:28 - subtleness but if we could animate that
44:30 - more slowly over time so the slider
44:32 - isn't the best way of demonstrating that
44:34 - but you'll see a lot of possibilities
44:35 - here another thing that I could
44:38 - demonstrate here and let's just put it
44:41 - at five just start books open oh it goes
44:44 - to five and then zero point one so all
44:47 - right so another thing that I could
44:48 - demonstrate to you is interesting like a
44:50 - always starts at zero because I'm going
44:53 - from zero to 2pi
44:54 - but if I am walking around the path of a
44:57 - circle there's no reason why I couldn't
44:58 - start over here and then go around or
45:01 - start over here and then go around and
45:02 - why not vary that that would be like the
45:04 - phase if you go back to my for ei trips
45:06 - all of this stuff it's so crazily
45:08 - interrelated it's amazing but if you go
45:10 - back to my Fourier transform videos
45:12 - where we created these orbiting
45:14 - epicycles we had this concept of phase
45:16 - which is where does that orbit start so
45:19 - let me show you another thing here okay
45:22 - what I'm gonna do is show you so let me
45:26 - make a variable called phase let me have
45:28 - that be zero I'm gonna have cosine of
45:31 - angle plus phase sine of angle plus
45:34 - phase what do you think's going to
45:36 - happen if I increment phase well it
45:44 - looks like the shape is rotating I mean
45:46 - it is rotating or it's not rotating
45:47 - means usually is rotating but I'm
45:49 - actually just starting at a different
45:50 - point of the no noise space
45:52 - interestingly enough like and if I make
45:55 - that much small
45:56 - you'll actually see that like smaller
45:58 - than the amount of vertices I have you
46:00 - start to see a wiggle between them so
46:01 - interest it's like I could make this
46:02 - point too and that's going to be even
46:04 - more apparent let's look at that crazy
46:07 - weird wiggle as those vertices adjust
46:11 - their spot and then I want to show you
46:13 - something even crazier I think like let
46:16 - me put it back let me sink it so this is
46:18 - like a nice perfect rotation what if I
46:21 - only apply the phase to the X offset or
46:24 - the y offset like different phases that
46:27 - is real it's kind of too fast so let me
46:30 - do like this like this is really weird
46:33 - you can sort of see it's almost like
46:35 - there's something crawling around the
46:37 - edge yeah there's so much weirdness
46:40 - stuff going so anyway you see the sort
46:42 - of like exciting possibilities of
46:45 - thinking about Perlin noise values as
46:48 - one-dimensional values that you might
46:50 - pull over time you know in a sort of
46:52 - one-dimensional fashion but actually
46:54 - pull them from the path of a circle in
46:57 - the two-dimensional Perlin noise space
46:59 - now what I happen to be doing in this is
47:02 - taking a very literal approach I'm
47:04 - taking those pearly noise Pat path
47:06 - values walking around a circle now
47:08 - plugging them to like the distance from
47:10 - the center of a circle over time as I'm
47:13 - drawing it so it's very like it's a very
47:15 - literal sort of like visualization of
47:17 - Perlin noise values in a circle to the
47:19 - edge points of a circle but if you start
47:22 - to think of other ways you could apply
47:25 - those values the creative possibilities
47:27 - explode and so in other words if this is
47:31 - what I started with
47:33 - I have Perlin noise at the beginning
47:36 - sorry i've Perlin noise values in one
47:39 - dimensional space but they don't loop
47:41 - why not take those looping values here
47:44 - along the path of a circle and then
47:46 - unfurl them back into the sort of one
47:49 - dimensional line and then use those to
47:52 - apply to any value in any visualization
47:55 - to make a perfect gift Luke that's the
47:56 - idea so I'm gonna just put that out
47:59 - there and putting this out into the
48:00 - universe I mean I didn't put down the
48:01 - universe lots of other people
48:02 - it's yin and go on and many others I'm
48:04 - sure I'm forgetting to reference have
48:06 - done this for years
48:08 - so give that a try in the next video I'm
48:11 - gonna come back and actually do that so
48:12 - I'm gonna see if I can take this idea
48:14 - and just apply it to something probably
48:17 - won't be that visually interesting but
48:19 - this will hopefully give you lots of
48:20 - ideas of what you might make okay so
48:23 - thanks for watching this coding
48:25 - challenge where we now have this kind of
48:27 - blobby thing oh wait wait wait
48:29 - I should really add the third dimension
48:31 - here and I'm trying to decide should I
48:46 - make the third dimension
48:59 - this is so weird yeah I think I will
49:13 - okay let's add one more thing to this I
49:17 - think I have I think I can this video is
49:19 - not too long so far alright let's add
49:21 - one more thing so for so let me take out
49:22 - this idea of phase for a second I'm just
49:24 - gonna comment that out and put it back
49:26 - to what it was which is just this so
49:29 - every time i run it i get a new Perlin
49:31 - noise space and incidentally the only
49:34 - reason why I'm getting a new Perlin
49:36 - noise space is because p5 behind the
49:40 - scenes will see perla noise with a
49:42 - random seed each time but I could
49:44 - actually control if I were to say you
49:46 - know noise seed and pick some arbitrary
49:50 - seed value and random number seeds is
49:52 - maybe a topic for another video every
49:54 - time I run this like I'm gonna get
49:55 - exactly the same shape each time so
49:58 - anyway just point that but there is
49:59 - something else there's another way I
50:01 - could animate this and it has to do with
50:03 - three-dimensional Perla noise and Perla
50:05 - noise can exist in any n-dimensional
50:07 - space in p5 and in processing I think
50:10 - the functions that give it to you just
50:12 - support one two and three dimensions but
50:14 - let's talk about how you might use three
50:15 - dimensions here so for example if this
50:18 - is my visualization of Perlin noise in
50:20 - two-dimensional space that cloudy image
50:24 - well I could make sort of like a cloudy
50:27 - set of cubes in three dimensional space
50:29 - but another way of thinking about it is
50:31 - have that third dimension be slices of
50:34 - an animation so I could show you the
50:36 - Perlin noise space and over time while
50:40 - incrementing a Z value as Z offset shoyu
50:44 - Perlin noise for at Z offset equals zero
50:46 - then Z offset equals point one then
50:48 - point two then point three and so that
50:50 - actually all of those will have numbers
50:53 - you know each one of these numbers is
50:54 - now has all of its neighbors o2 up and
50:58 - down and left and right and forward and
51:00 - backward are similar random values so
51:02 - this is actually a really easy thing for
51:04 - me to add I just need one more global
51:06 - variable called Z offset and this needs
51:09 - to be global because I'm not resetting
51:11 - it back every time through draw each
51:13 - time through draw an incrementing it and
51:15 - I can just add Z off right there to the
51:19 - Perlin noise function and then I can say
51:22 - Z off plus equal some amount like point
51:24 - one and you can see we get this wig
51:26 - I can make it point zero one and I'm
51:28 - gonna move through the purlin oi space
51:29 - much more slowly and once again we could
51:32 - see like there's all sorts of things I
51:33 - could do here like this could be zero
51:35 - point three and this could be point one
51:38 - you know there's so many parameters that
51:39 - you could explore here I think we've
51:42 - made actually a super interesting shape
51:44 - for like a crazy animated game version
51:46 - of asteroids like you could imagine
51:48 - having Perlin noise giggling oscillating
51:50 - looping noisy polar asteroids that's the
51:54 - thing you should make so anyway so I
51:56 - hope you find some variations for this
51:58 - and I look forward to seeing what you
52:01 - make and stay tuned for the next video a
52:06 - torus shape yes a torus shape increased
52:09 - resolution it's just
52:15 - alright I probably should have if I
52:18 - thought about this made the stroke wait
52:21 - to for it to be a bit more give it a
52:24 - little more pop a little more zing gotta
52:27 - have thing coding train sponsored by
52:32 - zing zing
52:36 - [Music]
52:41 - I have an idea how hard is it gonna be -
52:49 - can I just get the mic like I can just
52:53 - do this right
52:53 - mic equals p5 got audio in and then I
52:57 - can just have this B is it get level No
53:16 - get volume shoot v5 sound
53:22 - I just wanted to tie it to the sound
53:23 - real quick audio in it's funny there's
53:30 - apparently there's a video about this
53:31 - where I'm wearing a tinfoil hat because
53:35 - I really really like input my Oh Mike
53:40 - got to start Mike get level p5 dot audio
53:44 - in okay what did I miss
53:45 - what'd I miss p5 got audio in Mike dot
53:52 - start Mike get level do I not have the
54:01 - sound library imported this was this was
54:03 - meant for me to just do one thing really
54:04 - quickly to make this fun cuz its cannot
54:09 - read properties start of undefined hold
54:13 - on I was just there and the code p5
54:21 - audio in Mike dot start Mike dot get
54:26 - level Mike dot start
54:33 - I forgot to show this but whatever Shh
54:40 - okay I don't know what did I have wrong
54:42 - they're so weird I must have something
54:45 - spelled wrong okay right here we go
55:08 - and here we go really it's not picking
55:18 - that up
55:24 - test my whole idea of taking a little
55:31 - break and just putting this on oh I
55:34 - forgot the new okay thank you everybody
55:36 - new p5 audio in how come oh is it
55:52 - it's just so quiet
55:59 - I should I should also have the phase
56:02 - going so it spins test one two
56:10 - test one two oh this has to test one two
56:21 - test one two and then hold on I don't
56:24 - know why I'm like trying to make
56:25 - something interesting out of this that's
56:26 - not my job I'm terrible at that let's do
56:29 - this it's the polar two Cartesian
56:33 - coordinate song
56:45 - [Music]
56:48 - and they say once again
56:50 - [Music]
57:04 - [Music]
58:06 - all right and we're back
58:10 - alright I probably should have I
58:12 - probably I mean it's save I probably
58:14 - should put this back to what it was
58:16 - because this is let me just do a
58:18 - duplicate and that will be this will be
58:22 - the noise loop audio in just in case
58:25 - I'll publish this as well and it's not
58:27 - like part of the coding challenge and
58:29 - let me just go file open and just go to
58:34 - this noise loop let me get rid of the
58:36 - audio in thing and put this back and put
58:48 - what is this now yeah what why not I can
58:54 - leave the weird little background thing
58:55 - in
59:03 - interesting sorry I can't resist playing
59:07 - with this stuff I'm gonna stop I gonna
59:17 - stop I have to stop okay
59:20 - can you check Twitter for generative
59:22 - arts I don't know what that means
59:26 - let me save I have to stop and now what
59:31 - I want to do is do this okay this is too
59:41 - frenetic I want something more soothing
59:45 - and relaxing it's too frenetic maybe Z
59:49 - offset is too much yeah that's nicer
59:59 - although should be this yes and all
60:11 - right I'm gonna stop doing what I'm
60:13 - doing and I am going to go back to this
60:21 - alright so I have to think about what is
60:23 - it that Oh what is the example that I'm
60:26 - gonna demonstrate now with turning this
60:30 - into a loop I mean I guess I can make
60:34 - the most and actually somebody had
60:37 - suggested to me a gift library now I
60:41 - know I wanted to use this P 5 gift
60:43 - library so let me see if I can find this
61:05 - just finding something here for a second
61:15 - p5 gift okay so there's this library but
61:20 - somebody pointed out to me a library
61:22 - that uses webworkers gif canvas
61:28 - JavaScript web workers let's see if this
61:32 - comes out this was in a youtube comment
61:34 - this is it so I'm curious to try this ad
61:44 - frame
61:51 - ad frame delay copy how do I know when
61:56 - it's finished how do i render okay all
62:00 - right so I'm curious to try this gift
62:05 - Jas library I do love this library that
62:12 - was created by my students but it had a
62:13 - few bugs in it and I'm sort of curious
62:15 - to try this probably not a good idea to
62:19 - try a library for the first time during
62:22 - a live stream but why not oh I forgot to
62:26 - mention this but that's fine we're back
62:29 - to here and we've got this alright okay
62:39 - do web workers work in the p5 editor I
62:43 - guess we're gonna find out maybe I
62:46 - should try this real quick if you if you
62:50 - will all bear with me for a second
62:56 - so is this hosted with a CDN I don't
63:04 - know maybe I need to download the
63:05 - library dist oh I need all this I'm so
63:11 - confused
63:13 - [Music]
63:21 - let's download this whoops
63:28 - and I assume also need this
63:42 - let me do duplicate let me add these
63:51 - files
64:00 - but seem to have worked
64:04 - [Music]
64:11 - let me add this here gift out worker ojs
64:19 - and gift out yes okay no errors so to
64:28 - speak let's put this back to 400 by 400
64:33 - now what I need to do if this is gonna
64:36 - work is I can create a new gif give her
64:43 - this Mike it's knocking we take off Auto
64:47 - refresh that's gonna make it crazy let's
64:50 - try just doing this add frame canvas
64:56 - element I think I should be able to say
64:58 - [Music]
64:59 - gif add frame okay so I need to say let
65:04 - canvas canvas equals create canvas
65:08 - canvas TLT I don't want this delay let's
65:11 - just take that out that should do that
65:14 - let's just see does this give me an
65:15 - error no air as far as I can tell and
65:18 - then what I need here is unfinished and
65:27 - then gift render maybe I'll do render on
65:34 - I'll make a button button button equals
65:43 - create button render and then button
65:47 - mouse pressed gift bows a gift render so
65:56 - this should in theory now I'm adding
66:01 - frames I'm adding frames I click render
66:03 - I couldn't seem to work
66:06 - let's check the console
66:09 - [Music]
66:14 - the server responded with the status of
66:17 - 4/4 so maybe I can't do a web worker oh
66:27 - I couldn't find all right I'm gonna have
66:31 - to investigate this more
66:50 - all right everybody alvaro rights could
66:55 - create a circular path in Z offset so
66:57 - that gif is also periodic in time
66:59 - exactly alright so I'm gonna have to
67:03 - investigate this later already running
67:05 - okay hold on
67:06 - Oh cuz the workers running I don't know
67:08 - let's completely refresh probably
67:15 - shouldn't be trying this in the web
67:16 - editor yeah okay I'm gonna give up on
67:22 - this now it was good that I tried doing
67:25 - it that I know that this doesn't work
67:26 - and go back to here
67:47 - how come this
67:57 - maybe it didn't save actually all right
68:00 - actually hold on hold on just give me
68:03 - one more second I wonder if I just hit
68:05 - that weird saving bug this is it right
68:09 - no gift test no all right I'm not okay
68:25 - this is alright so what I'm gonna do if
68:32 - you don't mind humoring me for a second
68:36 - so I'm gonna switch to processing
68:49 - hello
68:59 - quit processing
69:11 - there we go
69:16 - and then I'm going to do desktop let me
69:31 - just quickly convert this code to
69:33 - processing
69:55 - same exact thing and let me simplify
70:03 - Lily get rid of this phase
70:19 - okay
70:25 - okay all right
70:37 - just check the time let's see here so
70:50 - the reason why I want to use processing
70:53 - is I also want to this is gift loop oh
71:02 - that's not what I'm gift pull look like
71:09 - I'm gonna call this polar noise blob
71:14 - okay and then I what I now need is I
71:21 - need this code a little bit and
71:30 - processing until I have a solid way to
71:33 - generate the gif in in JavaScript I'm
71:40 - going to use processing for making these
71:43 - gift loops so let me open this so that's
71:51 - this okay so this is the gift loop
72:06 - and this is the blop and this is this
72:10 - alright okay
72:18 - increment I by radians one interesting
72:22 - okay that's an interesting thing to try
72:39 - all right part two is coming up right
72:41 - now okay
73:01 - all right sorry I'm thinking I'm
73:05 - thinking hello and welcome to part 2 of
73:09 - the polar hello and welcome to part 2 of
73:25 - the polar
73:28 - Perlin noise loose I wrote polar noise
73:31 - loops on purpose as like a wordplay
73:33 - thing but people kept saying no no it's
73:35 - pearl annoys pearl annoys this has polar
73:37 - Perlin noise loops the whole point of
73:38 - this is I'm doing a follow-up of my
73:40 - previous coding challenge where I made
73:42 - this blobby shape which is created with
73:47 - a Perlin noise algorithm and the end of
73:49 - the shape matches up to the beginning of
73:51 - the shape by walking through a
73:53 - two-dimensional Perlin noise space in in
73:57 - a circle hold on I'm out this is a good
74:03 - time for me to show Golan's gif olan
74:12 - sketch
74:19 - if you're wondering what I'm talking
74:22 - about go and watch the previous video
74:24 - but also I forgot in the previous fed I
74:26 - neglected to show this particular sketch
74:29 - created in p5.js by goal on leaven which
74:32 - demonstrates this idea so the ideas I
74:35 - want to use Perlin noise values over
74:37 - time but I want the last value to match
74:40 - up with the first value and so if I pull
74:42 - those values from a circular path and in
74:45 - truth it doesn't have to be circular as
74:46 - Luz I end up where I started then I'm
74:49 - gonna have this perfect looping Perlin
74:51 - noise so why not take that perfect
74:54 - looping Perlin noise and apply it to my
74:57 - gift loop so that I can miss this in the
75:00 - gift loop coding challenge I just had
75:02 - this rotating circle it's very easy to
75:04 - have the and match up at the beginning
75:06 - but what if what I want to create with
75:08 - is random chaotic algorithmic scenes of
75:12 - beauty and an example an artist who does
75:14 - this is Etienne Jacob and you can read
75:18 - more about this work at necessary or
75:20 - necessary disorder wordpress com this is
75:23 - a blog post from November 15th 2017 you
75:26 - can find many more of these like amazing
75:28 - gifts on a Chen's Twitter account all of
75:32 - which I will link to in this video's
75:33 - description so this this video is
75:35 - inspired by the beautiful work and this
75:37 - this just is mind-blowing to me this is
75:39 - not this is not a sketch running over
75:42 - time it is a perfect loop yet it seems
75:45 - as if it's just a continuous random
75:47 - chaos so how are we gonna achieve this
75:49 - so I admittedly I think by the end of
75:50 - this video I'm going to end up creating
75:52 - something incredibly simple but I hope
75:54 - it will unlock a superpower for you
75:56 - which is this polar noise loops okay
76:02 - alright so let's go
76:05 - let's go back to all this stuff so what
76:07 - do i what do I want first I want to go
76:09 - and by the way I in in the in between
76:12 - the last video and this current one come
76:18 - on computer respond to me I get a
76:22 - perfect connection if you increment I by
76:23 - radians one I see I see all right
76:31 - in between in between the previous video
76:35 - and this one why is this not open why
76:39 - why why why
76:39 - come on oh stop there it is oh it's just
76:43 - there why it should it should switch
76:46 - windows when I click on this this is a
76:48 - bug in processing now it doesn't seem to
76:50 - be working is it because it's running
76:52 - switch no switch oh processing
76:59 - processing all right I'll just do this
77:04 - it's fine fun this is the one I want
77:07 - right now anyway
77:11 - so one thing you might have noticed is
77:14 - in the previous video I was working in
77:16 - JavaScript I have now moved over to Java
77:19 - using the processing development
77:21 - environment this is mostly because of
77:22 - what I want to do now is render files
77:24 - out that I can then repackage into a
77:27 - gift you can do that in JavaScript too
77:29 - but I haven't found like a really
77:31 - excellent elegant solution for doing
77:32 - that yet so when I'm working with
77:34 - rendering I generally prefer to be in
77:36 - processing and also I like to just show
77:38 - you different things so I have ported
77:39 - that code the exact same code but I'm in
77:41 - processing now and so what I want to do
77:43 - is first let me get rid of so to speak
77:46 - this this visualization entirely I
77:51 - should really start yeah
78:04 - actually let me not get rid of a
78:06 - visualization entirely right let me get
78:12 - rid of this visualization entirely first
78:14 - so I don't really care about this our
78:16 - thing right now and I do I do care about
78:23 - this hold on sorry I'm getting confused
78:32 - here what am i doing and I'm typing let
78:35 - just give me a second here I know what I
78:39 - want to say I know what I want to say
78:42 - different so let me get rid of the fact
78:48 - that there is a loop in draw to start
78:51 - and what I actually want is for and I
78:54 - want to get rid of this big in shape and
78:56 - shape and what and what I want is for
78:58 - that angle variable that's to be a that
79:02 - a variable to be a global variable so
79:04 - I'm gonna say float a equals zero and
79:05 - I'm going to here just increment a by
79:08 - some arbitrary amount over time and this
79:12 - that I'm gonna have to be more
79:13 - thoughtful about this but let me just
79:15 - change that and then let me also then
79:18 - say ellipse at X Y a 16 16 so what is
79:23 - happening here right now that is moving
79:26 - super fast so let's say point zero one
79:28 - so what I'm doing now is I'm actually
79:30 - having that circle - I'm having an
79:34 - ellipse trace along that path that was
79:36 - previously that strange shape so I don't
79:39 - I don't really care about mapping the
79:42 - noise value right now I just want to be
79:44 - able to see it so let's just say R
79:48 - equals 100 just to see it okay so I have
79:51 - this oh I don't like what I'm doing look
79:53 - just give me another shot at this give
79:59 - me another shot at this because what I
80:03 - want to do I can you know the shot this
80:17 - me I am so be there is a gift library
80:20 - for p5 go and look at the one that I
80:22 - just referenced I'll send it to you it
80:24 - just needs a little help I don't think
80:26 - it's ready for prime time but it
80:28 - actually is quite there's many things
80:30 - about it that are awesome ok use circle
80:33 - you circle thank you okay alright well
80:42 - so let me start adjusting this code to
80:44 - get the Perlin noise values from walking
80:46 - around the perimeter of that circle so
80:48 - all of the stuff that I'm drawing here
80:50 - with this blobby thing is kind of
80:52 - irrelevant at this point and in fact I
80:53 - don't need to have a loop inside draw
80:55 - anymore so I'm gonna take out that loop
80:58 - I'm gonna take out all the drawing stuff
81:02 - I'm gonna take out begin shape take all
81:05 - the drawing stuff this translate and
81:07 - what I am what I need now what I'm left
81:10 - with and I don't need this x and y
81:11 - either what I'm left with is the fact
81:16 - that this angle this a value needs to be
81:18 - a global variable so this now is let's
81:28 - I'm just gonna I'm gonna just change
81:30 - this this is now right here all I'm
81:35 - doing see is increasing in draw
81:40 - increasing the angle over time and
81:43 - asking for the noise value and I don't
81:47 - I'm gonna take out map even I'm just
81:49 - trying to simplify this really really
81:51 - simplify it the idea here is that I'm
81:55 - saying okay I just want to have and why
81:59 - is it giving complaining to me about
82:00 - what art because I'm not using it I know
82:06 - I understand what I'm doing to out of
82:10 - this I really understand what I'm doing
82:15 - now I know you don't believe me
82:18 - I mean you're right to not believe me I
82:27 - wouldn't believe me either
82:39 - so let me just answer a quick question
82:41 - you saw gyoji bow in the chat asked if
82:43 - this is java how is it possible to use
82:45 - functions outside of a class so this is
82:48 - processing and processing is is a
82:52 - programming development environment with
82:54 - its own set of functions that is built
82:57 - on top of java and it actually obscures
82:59 - the main class for you so you can
83:01 - actually just write kind of procedural
83:03 - code just in a simple text editor
83:05 - without all the java java mumbo-jumbo
83:07 - but it also does support the java mumbo
83:09 - jumbo if you like the java mumble java
83:11 - all right here we go
83:15 - all right here we go
83:17 - here we go
83:25 - so now I'm going to start with this code
83:28 - but I'm basically I'm gonna remove
83:30 - almost all of it because what I want
83:32 - ultimately is I just want a single noise
83:34 - value over time walking along the
83:37 - perimeter of a circle so the idea of
83:39 - looping inside draw is no longer
83:41 - relevant so I can take that out the idea
83:46 - of drawing anything is no longer
83:48 - relevant so I can take that out I don't
83:51 - need this translate what I do need is
83:54 - this idea of calling the noise function
83:57 - in two-dimensional space based on an
84:01 - angle that's incrementing over time
84:03 - around the perimeter of a circle so now
84:05 - that angle has to be a global variable
84:10 - that angle every time through draw gets
84:13 - incremented by some amount and I'm gonna
84:15 - when I want to make a gift loop I'm
84:16 - going to change that to the percentage
84:18 - thing because I want to go from zero all
84:20 - the way to two pi and that's the end of
84:23 - the gift loop that closes the loop but
84:27 - but for now just incrementing it by an
84:29 - arbitrary amount is fine and if I were
84:31 - to say print line R let's watch this go
84:36 - so if I run this what we're seeing is
84:40 - the noise values now this is looping you
84:42 - can't tell but I'm getting the same
84:44 - noise values over to Gavin except not
84:46 - really because point one isn't perfectly
84:48 - divisible by two pi but I'm not going to
84:50 - worry about that David Schneider
84:53 - actually pointed out that if I use the
84:55 - radiance functions like 360 divides into
84:58 - one perfectly so I could say like or it
85:00 - divides into ten even so I can say plus
85:02 - equal radians of one this will actually
85:04 - now give me a perfect loop thank you for
85:07 - that suggestion so now what I need to do
85:10 - is map those noise values to something
85:13 - so I'm just I could do color I could do
85:16 - position I could do size let's have it
85:20 - let's have it do position I think that's
85:22 - kind of a very literal way of looking at
85:25 - it so I'm going to now say x equals map
85:28 - R which has a range between 0 and 1 to 0
85:30 - and width I'm gonna use the circle
85:33 - function because it's my favorite
85:34 - function X comma height divided by 2
85:38 - 100 and now I'm gonna do this and we can
85:42 - see this looks like randomness right
85:44 - this looks like randomness this looks
85:47 - like smooth randomness Perlin noise but
85:49 - I it is a repeating pattern hard to see
85:52 - that repeating pattern but it is there
85:53 - so now what I want to do if I go back to
85:57 - my gift loop code and this is from a
86:00 - previous coding challenges they're all
86:02 - kind of interconnected at this point
86:03 - what I want to do now is take this idea
86:07 - so I need this global variable a to come
86:10 - over here I need to take all of this
86:13 - which is in previously in draw and it
86:16 - goes in to render my render I'm gonna
86:21 - paste it in here and then a the
86:25 - difference is a doesn't increment a is
86:28 - based on the percentage so a equals the
86:32 - percentage times 2 pi because if you
86:34 - recall from this video this video was
86:37 - designed this code example was designed
86:40 - to render frame by frame
86:42 - some looping pattern from 0 percent up
86:45 - to a hundred percent and now that I know
86:47 - that my Perlin noise values will loop as
86:50 - I go from 0 to 2 pi I can take the
86:53 - percentage of how far am i through to pi
86:55 - so let me run this now and we can see
86:58 - there we go now I believe this will be a
87:00 - perfect loop I can't tell can you tell
87:04 - that this is a perfect loop I can I
87:05 - could increase the number of frames to
87:07 - slow it down I could change the noise I
87:09 - there's a bunch of things I could do but
87:11 - let me leave it like that and now I am
87:14 - going to turn on recording I'm gonna say
87:17 - record equals true this is the system I
87:19 - set up before if I say record equals
87:21 - true it's gonna save out to a folder a
87:24 - whole bunch of frames let me make sure
87:27 - there's nothing in that folder right now
87:28 - no so I'm gonna do this it's gonna quit
87:32 - when it's done and now all and now if I
87:34 - go to the folder and output we can see I
87:37 - have oh there's a bit of a problem that
87:42 - was weird the first frame it draws it at
87:45 - the center and then jumps is that was
87:48 - that a coincidence or is that actually
87:50 - right
87:52 - I think it's I think it should be fine
87:53 - all right I think I got it right let's
87:56 - let's turn that into a gif and see if it
87:58 - loops take time out for a second so
88:09 - before I use that easy gift thing so I'm
88:13 - going to tell me that maybe now I should
88:16 - use a command line tool like ffmpeg how
88:31 - do make gifs with fm MPEG
88:39 - mm-hm does anybody know off the top of
88:43 - their head what the command for so
88:44 - frugal do I have ffmpeg installed
89:06 - okay so this Oh run away from ffmpeg I
89:11 - just like I really kind of hated
89:13 - bringing up easy gift calm I mean it was
89:16 - fine for that video but since I have in
89:18 - the video there's no reason why I
89:19 - couldn't show another another solution
89:22 - like a command-line utility gifts a Cole
89:38 - let's look at this on github yeah
89:42 - June 1st 2018 that's almost less than a
89:45 - year ago
89:56 - so Alvaro hasn't could we make an
89:58 - animation in which periodicity is more
90:00 - obvious yet the the ffmpeg - I
90:12 - something-something output dot gif
90:17 - hamelot dot IO how to ffmpeg PNG files -
90:23 - gif how to ffmpeg PNG files is that like
90:29 - the search I want to do Oh
90:35 - so this where where % 0 3d is the frame
90:40 - ID in three digits it's interesting gif
90:47 - cycle is good at recommended ok people
90:49 - are telling me gifs achill is
90:50 - recommended
91:00 - a world gif gift merge how do I install
91:07 - it I don't want to install with macports
91:10 - homebrew macports no do I have brew
91:17 - installed yeah apparently I do well
91:21 - let's try it brew what do I do it I like
91:29 - brew install gift cycle how do you spell
91:31 - gift cycle totally worked
91:40 - oh what a world we live in welcome to
91:45 - 2019 everybody can't create update
91:49 - lock-in okay
91:53 - sure why not that looks reasonable
92:11 - permission denied no I did that okay
92:14 - this okay
92:20 - Oh promising okay
92:31 - gif sickle give cyclists pail gif sickle
92:39 - is a terminal okay so probably something
92:47 - like this delay equals 10 - - loop star
92:51 - dot gif okay so my guess is gif
92:57 - sickle - - loop star dot PNG test gif
93:16 - file is not in gif format that didn't
93:20 - work yeah I know it's why it's in PNG
93:26 - it's in PNG
93:35 - so I have to say let's check the chat
93:42 - shouldn't we use mp4 the html5 instead
93:45 - of gifts on the web already probably
93:49 - probably probably probably needs to be
93:51 - in a gif format gifs achill only allows
93:53 - a gift for mounting back to ffmpeg do I
93:56 - have ffmpeg installed ffmpeg well I'm
94:00 - not even going to get to the inheritance
94:03 - stuff today am i I'm going to I can make
94:05 - it happen alright let's try there any
94:11 - other documentation here so install
94:15 - ffmpeg Mac let's just try to find the
94:29 - official source here okay
94:31 - oh look install install documentation
94:36 - documentation download download look at
94:40 - this all right oh just a static builds
94:48 - for Mac OS ok whoa let's try this
94:52 - release snapshot let's get the release
94:59 - oh uh oh my god this is terrifying yes
95:06 - Simon I see the I see what you're
95:11 - putting there in terms of the
95:12 - millisecond stuff
95:21 - oops well this install for now let's try
95:24 - this Here I am just installing ffmpeg it
95:32 - gives me literally gives me the actual I
95:35 - can put it's up to me to put it in like
95:37 - user local bin on my own I guess I could
95:40 - install it with let's just install it
95:41 - with brew I'm afraid of brew but this is
95:45 - oh why not
95:50 - alright this will do ok alright Jared
95:59 - Ola check is giving me a nice command
96:01 - could somebody who is watching can
96:03 - someone to paste that command into the
96:07 - slack channel because it's gonna scroll
96:08 - past too fast for me to remember it
96:20 - all right all right so we've got ffmpeg
96:28 - all right that's promising so there was
96:31 - a command let's get rid of this
96:48 - okay so now ffmpeg - F what's image -
96:54 - why do I have image - there why image -
97:00 - I guess that's like convert image - like
97:03 - convert - frame rate one okay - I gif -
97:11 - % D PNG and then test dot gif is my file
97:18 - name let's try this in the range 0
97:23 - through 4 so I think this isn't right
97:28 - because do I have to do this like
97:33 - something like that no so what would it
97:40 - be
97:45 - let's just try this just curious
97:50 - ok so that worked but I've been feeling
97:53 - it only used it only probably use the
97:56 - first 10 frames right but let's see if
98:00 - it actually made something oops
98:13 - oh it's nice and slow I love that yeah
98:21 - it's only the first 10 frames and why
98:23 - does it but such a big jump in the first
98:25 - one - app image - so zero 3d okay ah 3ds
98:33 - 3d okay thank you
98:35 - that makes sense percent 3d okay let's
98:46 - try that no no
99:02 - famous last words
99:24 - percent 3d % 0 3 let's try that no can I
99:35 - just do like star dot PNG I just do this
99:40 - No
99:55 - percent zero 3d because there's zero
99:57 - padded no the docs could help no I don't
100:02 - have to look at the docs that's why I
100:03 - have a live chat going to look up for
100:05 - the docs for me and give me the correct
100:07 - answer the problem is you're like 30
100:10 - seconds behind so that's not gonna work
100:45 - I mean I could write them out without it
100:51 - being zero all right I don't even
101:04 - remember where I was
101:05 - oh what if I do this I have an idea I
101:09 - have an idea won't it just work for me
101:15 - to do this
101:19 - can't I just do that No
101:25 - wrong directory directory uh I've been
101:38 - in the wrong directory the whole time
101:41 - why did that happen how did that happen
101:48 - [Music]
101:51 - hold on
101:58 - oh so sad there we go yes over right
102:17 - so I think this is a bad example because
102:21 - it is - it's moving too quickly but it
102:26 - does work
102:33 - I do like this as a new technique though
102:36 - so hold on so let me go back now that I
102:39 - know that this works
102:50 - the question is how can I make this a
102:57 - more illustrative example would just
103:01 - doing this
103:02 - no that's would having more frames no oh
103:13 - I don't want to record right now how
103:22 - could I make this example more
103:23 - illustrative of the idea that I'm trying
103:26 - to demonstrate yes so this slowing it
103:34 - down would help so maybe that's just
103:42 - what I want to do
103:55 - okay
103:57 - ffmpeg can do frame interpolation that's
104:00 - a cool idea make it go in a circle
104:03 - without noise so it's clear it's looping
104:06 - oh like add in all right so this is a
104:09 - good idea let's add in I have an idea
104:12 - okay okay thank you that's a good idea
104:16 - do the same has gold on yeah okay hold
104:23 - on a sec so actually let me stop for a
104:42 - second because let me stop for a second
104:46 - because this example I think isn't very
104:48 - illustrative of the point that I'm
104:50 - trying to make first of all it's moving
104:51 - so quickly that you could probably fake
104:54 - the idea of it looping pretty easily
104:55 - even without a perfect loop so let me
104:57 - see if I can demonstrate this more
105:00 - clearly
105:01 - number one is let me also in addition to
105:05 - drawing that circle let me draw
105:07 - something moving in a circular pattern
105:10 - so I'm gonna translate to the middle I'm
105:12 - gonna give myself a radius of 100 pixels
105:18 - and then I'm just gonna draw a line from
105:22 - zero zero to radius actually let me let
105:26 - me give it let me calculate an x and y
105:28 - again x equals radius times cosine of
105:32 - that angle y equals radius times sine of
105:37 - that angle and I'm gonna do I'm just
105:41 - gonna make these other names x1 y1 I'm
105:45 - gonna draw that line and then draw a
105:47 - point draw another little circle another
105:51 - circle at x1 y1 that's smaller so let me
105:58 - run this for a second so this should all
106:00 - right and let me say a stroke let me
106:06 - also add a stroke 255
106:10 - and I kind of wanted to go the other way
106:14 - around but whatever so and then let me
106:17 - make this circle have a bit of color to
106:21 - it Phil let me just actually let me just
106:25 - give it a little bit of alpha okay so
106:29 - the idea here now is that this is
106:31 - definitely a perfect loop in the sense
106:33 - that that circle is rotating perfectly
106:36 - now can I make this thing that's moving
106:38 - randomly also loop I think one way to
106:41 - demonstrate this idea is just to really
106:42 - slow down its movement so if I change
106:44 - the noise max to one and probably also I
106:50 - think what would be helpful is let me
106:52 - make it much wider so that and I'm so
106:59 - that it's kind of moving and with more
107:05 - with more variation left and right so
107:08 - now it's my my argument that this is a
107:13 - perfect noise loop I'm seeing the exact
107:16 - circular loop and just just so this is
107:19 - visually a bit more clear let me also
107:21 - make the stroke wait for so you can see
107:23 - these a bit more easily so the circular
107:27 - loop is looping perfectly as a circle
107:29 - but the Perlin noise value is also
107:32 - looping which is mapped to its XY to the
107:35 - x position of that other circle okay
107:37 - let's render this now so I'm gonna
107:41 - switch this to true as I was about to do
107:44 - before and I'm going to render it out so
107:48 - we're gonna run this when it finishes
107:50 - its loop it stops I'm gonna look in now
107:56 - look in the output I'm gonna look at the
107:58 - first one which we can see the circle is
108:01 - though that's weird
108:02 - why is there no stroke around that
108:05 - circle I think that might have some kind
108:06 - of weird error with the first frame that
108:11 - is so weird why why what's going on
108:14 - if render percent if record output Y is
108:19 - the first one not like a fully finished
108:24 - version of this so weird there's like a
108:29 - weird bug going on here we delete the
108:34 - output again
108:49 - why why why why why oh I why is the
108:55 - first frame oh no oh I don't have the
109:03 - stroke here hi everybody sorry sorry
109:07 - there's just a weird little silly bud
109:08 - which is not that important which is
109:10 - that I have the stroke set after drawing
109:12 - that first circle that was just a
109:14 - mistake
109:14 - so that's why it wasn't appearing in the
109:16 - first frame I can run this again so it
109:18 - also gave me a nice suggestion which is
109:20 - to put this to put this circle actually
109:26 - also at the same Y position which is
109:29 - kind of interesting let's try this just
109:34 - really briefly yeah so this is kind of
109:38 - in will oh yeah but it's offset okay
109:41 - hold on everybody
109:42 - everything's gonna be fine let me make
109:43 - this a little nicer let me move let me
109:44 - translate everything let me calculate
109:47 - all the values before I draw everything
109:49 - and then also I want this to be I have
109:53 - an idea oh this is gonna be so much
109:54 - better now now I want this the x value
109:57 - to be mapped between negative width and
110:00 - width times two which is going to put it
110:03 - all over the place
110:04 - okay so now you're gonna see this rocket
110:06 - so there we go so that looks like it's
110:08 - moving chaotically which it is we do
110:10 - this one more time sort of entering in
110:13 - moving around left
110:18 - okay that was too extreme I guess I
110:21 - shouldn't like give it such an extreme
110:23 - let me just do negative with divided by
110:26 - two and let me do like let me do like
110:32 - point
110:33 - oh just negative width and width would
110:36 - be fine I don't know what I'm doing
110:38 - there sorry that was my range was weird
110:40 - let me give it that range now okay one
110:44 - more time let's just see it's luke go Oh
110:47 - goodbye go back in whoo that was weird
110:51 - oh okay hold on
111:00 - let me back up for a second let me just
111:06 - do this for a second kind of put my
111:10 - finger on where it started yeah that's
111:14 - fine
111:24 - that was what I was saying the same I've
111:26 - you've been recording the whole time no
111:28 - no I know everyone's sorry this is going
111:30 - off the rails a little bit let me back
111:32 - up I'm a I'm just gonna like back up so
111:39 - that to where I had that stroke bug so
111:46 - that there's not meatless like constant
111:47 - stopping and starting okay this was the
111:51 - problem
112:00 - yeah no I did I want negative with so I
112:03 - know I was gonna try to expand the range
112:05 - because Perlin noise like keeps around
112:07 - the center so much which is why I was
112:08 - saying I know that the correct range is
112:10 - negative it's far between and so that's
112:12 - what I'm gonna do
112:13 - all right
112:25 - all right this weird little bug why is
112:27 - there no outline in the first frame is
112:30 - just because I missed something quite
112:32 - obvious in my code which is that I have
112:35 - the stroke drawn right here so I
112:37 - actually want to let me fix this up a
112:40 - little bit because I kind of drew this
112:41 - thing in this very weird way let me
112:43 - actually draw everything relative to the
112:45 - center
112:46 - let me put stroke and stroke weight
112:49 - right at the beginning and then the
112:53 - angle is always the percentage times 2
112:56 - pi I'm gonna get this noise value and
112:58 - then what I'm gonna do is I am I'm gonna
113:02 - I'm gonna get these I'm gonna get this
113:04 - is like X 1 this is like X 2 y 2 and
113:08 - what I'm going to do and I'm have this
113:11 - raise I'm just gonna draw everything
113:12 - relative to the center now so and this
113:16 - I'm gonna change this to n 4 noise just
113:19 - so R isn't confusing so I'm drawing both
113:21 - a circle that is moving horizontally
113:29 - with Perlin noise as well as a perfectly
113:33 - orbiting line and little dot so and then
113:38 - because everything is being drawn
113:39 - relative to the center I've got to
113:41 - change my range to negative width
113:42 - divided by 2
113:43 - width divided by 2 and this should be X
113:46 - 1 and this is X 2 okay so now we see
113:49 - this now one thing I could do that that
113:51 - someone suggested to make this a little
113:53 - bit more visually compelling let me just
113:56 - increase the stroke weight even more and
113:58 - let me draw the first circle also at
114:01 - that's the Y the Y height of that
114:05 - orbiting thing so this is going to look
114:06 - like something of a somewhat chaotic
114:08 - scene but it should if I did it
114:15 - correctly be a perfect gift loop so let
114:20 - me go here let me look in the output I
114:22 - see that's the first frame right this is
114:25 - here and this is here the last frame is
114:29 - that there and that bear matches up and
114:32 - guess what so in my previous gift loop
114:34 - coding challenge I used a web service
114:37 - easy gift calm there's another thing you
114:40 - could use called ffmpeg let me pull up
114:42 - the ffmpeg website ffmpeg
114:47 - is a complete cross-platform solution to
114:49 - record convert dream audio and video now
114:51 - I've already installed ffmpeg on this
114:54 - computer it's a command-line utility so
114:56 - how to do that it's something I'd be
114:57 - happy to come back and do in another
114:59 - video but what I can do now is if I am
115:03 - in my console and I am in the directory
115:06 - I mean that output directory I can say I
115:09 - have this in the chat here ffmpeg the
115:14 - format is image - I want a framerate of
115:18 - like 30 frames per second and my I want
115:22 - to make it a gif no no this is my file
115:26 - name and this % 3d is indicating that I
115:30 - have all my filenames are named if you
115:35 - look at them they're all named gift -
115:38 - then three digits PNG so I can say
115:43 - percent 3d dot gif this is thank all of
115:45 - those files convert them from a image to
115:51 - a gif and then I just give it the file
115:55 - name of the gif I want so I'm gonna say
115:57 - a noise loop dot gif and I'ma hit enter
116:01 - it's gonna do oh darn I got an error
116:06 - what did I not what did I not do
116:08 - correctly here
116:22 - [Music]
116:28 - okay what I did incorrectly there is the
116:31 - files are named PNG I'm saving pngs out
116:34 - of processing converting them to a gif
116:38 - now I'm going to hit enter I'm gonna say
116:41 - a little gift prayer and it seemed to
116:43 - have worked and I'm gonna go now
116:46 - and look into that folder and all the
116:49 - way at the bottom or at the top or no
116:52 - where we're going to put it boys loop
116:56 - gift oh whoa whoa I mean like temporary
117:09 - land hold on a second huh hold on
117:51 - yeah there it is I don't know why it was
117:54 - I was it was I don't know what I deleted
117:58 - the folder ah delete of the folder and
118:01 - terminal put me into there okay sorry
118:03 - all right let me do that one more time
118:16 - okay so the files are named gif - 0 0 0
118:23 - dot PNG because they're PNG files I want
118:25 - to load the PNG files and turn them into
118:27 - a gift so now if I just need to change
118:30 - this to dot PNG noise loop gif hit enter
118:35 - uh-huh I did this already so that's for
118:38 - everyone over feet we are going to fake
118:48 - making this seem like I never made a
118:50 - mistake but I did make a mistake but I'm
118:51 - correcting a mistake ok here we go
119:00 - alright so the files that I saved from
119:03 - processing are not gifts they're pngs
119:06 - I'm taking the PA cheese and turning
119:08 - them into a gift so here we go
119:10 - PNG now I'm going to turn that it's a
119:13 - noise loop gift I'm gonna hit enter it's
119:15 - doing it a fitting it yeah it seems like
119:17 - it worked then I'm gonna go back to the
119:19 - finder into this folder I'm gonna go
119:22 - down and there it is
119:23 - noise loop gift and now we say our
119:25 - little noise loop prayer and watch the
119:32 - gift loop
119:38 - I it's a perfect loop I don't know this
119:42 - is like not the most illustrative
119:43 - example again because that y-value is
119:46 - kind of a yeah trick but anyway I don't
119:55 - like the fact that I gave it the Y
119:57 - position because then it makes it feel
120:00 - like it's moving in a circle it's like
120:01 - well it's so funny how it's like
120:03 - actually following the RO team that's
120:06 - just a coincidence right right if I do
120:11 - this again yeah see I don't want it to
120:17 - follow it
120:18 - I want that let me oh I got like a bad
120:20 - coincidence okay hold on
120:22 - noise we're gonna do I'll do this whole
120:30 - thing again
120:31 - oh wait of course start on the other
120:37 - side start far away this might be good
120:46 - huh no don't follow it you're too much
120:52 - following it I'm gonna find the perfect
120:59 - there we go there we go that was a good
121:05 - one okay okay okay okay
121:27 - all right one more one more time
121:39 - 42 is the answer lurk the why how can I
121:43 - make this more illustrative like giving
121:50 - it the Y value seems silly I could say
121:56 - like height - why
121:59 - no no I - height divided by 2 minus y so
122:04 - what I mean no well I could say negative
122:11 - Y yeah I wanted to start further away so
122:20 - let's do
122:36 - draw line from start to finish from the
122:39 - circle leave trailing ghosts behind the
122:42 - big circle but if I leave the trailing
122:45 - ghosts then the loo visual the loop
122:47 - won't visually match lerp the dirt needs
122:53 - more explosions that's a good suggestion
122:56 - all right hold on
123:15 - okay all right
123:25 - okay last try Here I am I kind of I'm
123:30 - good at we just like the cameras got to
123:34 - go off any second now change the color
123:42 - at the beginning of the end that's kind
123:43 - of a good idea that's a really good idea
123:50 - the brightness right I mean really I'm
123:57 - on a kind of a warpath here to trouble
124:00 - it point all right this oh yeah I'm back
124:06 - I'm not ready to render my gift yet I'm
124:08 - on a mission here which is try to really
124:10 - illustrate this point and so I did it I
124:12 - made a couple more changes one is I now
124:15 - I drawing this circle that's moving
124:17 - chaotically at negative Y value so at
124:20 - least it's reversed I don't want it to
124:21 - piers if it's following that circle and
124:23 - then I also extended the range of Perlin
124:25 - noise to a little bit more so it's
124:27 - moving a little bit more wildly I also
124:29 - added a noise seed so that I know every
124:32 - time I run it it's gonna run exactly the
124:34 - same thing now I got a great suggestion
124:36 - from the chat which is maybe to try
124:38 - adding color so another thing I can do
124:40 - here with this first circle maybe is
124:43 - have the brightness itself maybe the
124:46 - Alpha be up beat that noise value so I'm
124:49 - gonna take the noise value and a map it
124:53 - which is goes between 0 & 1 2 between 0
124:58 - and 255 so we can also and I need one
125:02 - more parenthesis here so we can also see
125:04 - that the color of that circle is
125:07 - shifting right the kind that's not very
125:12 - extreme I'm really torturing myself here
125:19 - let's try making an RGB yeah all right
125:23 - so it's a subtle color change but the
125:27 - color change Luke's perfectly okay all
125:30 - right I have to just give up I have to
125:31 - render this gift you as people who make
125:33 - beautiful interesting things with lots
125:35 - of creative ideas in your heads will
125:36 - really take this and run with it okay so
125:38 - I'm gonna now
125:39 - up here from record equals false to
125:43 - record equals true I'm gonna hit run and
125:46 - I'm gonna let this run it is going to do
125:51 - oh people are telling me sighs people
125:53 - are talking sighs okay one more thing
125:54 - one more thing let's change the size
125:56 - let's also change the size which map
126:00 - that noise I of 0 1 2 between like 50
126:03 - and 500 we're gonna make that kind of
126:05 - extreme and you know what I can do ooh
126:10 - you know what we could do ooh this is
126:12 - exciting I could actually have oh I have
126:15 - a really crazy idea this is I'm really
126:19 - making this a mess but I don't care I am
126:22 - going to get other noise values for the
126:30 - size you can't stop me I'm gonna just
126:34 - get X offset Y offset - I'm gonna make
126:37 - the noise max much bigger for that so
126:39 - that's going to be more chaotic and then
126:42 - I'm gonna get noise - I'm gonna get
126:45 - another noise value I shouldn't be
126:47 - allowed to do this anymore someone
126:49 - should just get bring the thing that
126:51 - hope they takes me off a mess a noise -
126:54 - so uh and then that's so this noise -
126:57 - value is gonna give me the size of this
126:59 - circle and so right so it's gonna do
127:01 - this and it's way too big so I do
127:03 - believe 10 and 100 so that's gonna give
127:08 - it kind of this chaotic quality but it's
127:10 - gonna loop perfectly okay this is it I
127:13 - rendered it and now I have all these
127:16 - frames I can check and see that the
127:18 - first frame it looks like this what does
127:21 - the last frame look like by doing 200 it
127:25 - looks like that that's perfect you can
127:27 - see that's right before it so let's see
127:29 - if this loops perfectly now the way I'm
127:32 - going to create my gift which is a
127:34 - little bit new is I'm going to use a
127:35 - tool called ffmpeg ffmpeg is a complete
127:39 - cross-platform solution to record
127:41 - convert and stream audio and video how
127:43 - you install ffmpeg would be a topic for
127:45 - another video but I have it installed on
127:47 - this on my computer and you can see that
127:50 - I can just type in term
127:51 - all commands to do things like convert
127:53 - this video file to this other format and
127:56 - I can type in some commands for a gif
127:58 - which is I have them written over here
128:01 - on my invisible computer ffmpeg
128:05 - - F image - I'm going to convert this
128:09 - image - I want a frame rate of 30 and
128:14 - then I need to give it the file names
128:16 - which is gif
128:17 - all my filenames are named gift - number
128:20 - number number dot PNG gif - and I can
128:23 - say there's going to be three digits
128:24 - percent 3d dot PNG and I want to turn
128:29 - that into my noise loop gif then I say
128:34 - my gift prayer gif gif gif gif I don't
128:40 - know I don't I'm like a gif atheist
128:42 - so whatever how's the prophetic prayer
128:44 - it's been like I've been streaming live
128:46 - streaming for like hours now okay we run
128:48 - this looks like it did some stuff so I
128:51 - can go back into my finder and look
128:53 - there's a noise loop gift and I can
128:56 - watch please PLEASE loop
128:58 - please loop just like loop ah it's
129:05 - seamless so this is so visually not that
129:09 - creative but I think now you can
129:13 - hopefully take this and understand
129:15 - something new about Perlin noise and how
129:17 - to make Perlin noise loop and make some
129:19 - more perfectly looping gifts that you
129:21 - could share you could give them as gifts
129:23 - to the Internet hashtag gift train gift
129:26 - reign train gift no no no gift train
129:29 - whatever I'll see you later in a future
129:32 - video thank you for watching all the
129:33 - code and all the links to things relate
129:37 - that I talked about in this video are
129:38 - all linked in the description ma see you
129:40 - soon
129:48 - okay that that is all all right is 12
130:01 - let me just all right hold on I'm gonna
130:03 - I need I need a like a few minutes to
130:09 - sort of see like how I'm doing on time
130:12 - so we're gonna take a short break and I
130:15 - will be back in a few minutes hopefully
130:17 - to do a little bit about
130:40 - [Music]
130:49 - [Music]
131:09 - [Music]
131:28 - I'm gonna do this this stock this dot
131:31 - this star this stock song never forget
131:33 - the Vince dot but somebody composed that
131:35 - song for me
131:39 - [Music]
131:48 - just give me I've been another Sigma hi
131:51 - four minutes I'm gonna go get some water
131:53 - [Music]
132:04 - are these coordinates
132:09 - [Music]
132:21 - and auto-tune and the internet will fix
132:24 - that for me
132:28 - [Music]
132:33 - coordinates
132:35 - [Music]
132:38 - it's the four to Cartesian coordinates
132:43 - it's coordinates
132:49 - [Music]
133:35 - [Music]
134:35 - [Music]
135:02 - [Applause]
135:04 - [Music]
136:25 - here's the water fun coding a square as
136:28 - the water here is the water it's
136:32 - actually quite far away walk all around
136:38 - okay alright so let's see here it's
136:48 - 12:45 I really want to get to this
136:57 - I really want to get to this other topic
137:03 - but it's gonna take me a minute to get
137:07 - there let's save all this stuff stop
137:14 - save so if you're wondering what I'm
137:30 - about to do I'm gonna do something very
137:33 - ill-advised and prototype JavaScript
137:41 - coding train okay that's perfect and the
138:04 - question is prototype do I have the code
138:09 - that I left off with here is it on is it
138:16 - here somewhere
138:20 - mmm would it be under tutorials p5.js
138:24 - like 16 No
138:27 - yeah 10 no where what is this video
138:34 - number 9 prototypes in JavaScript would
138:39 - it be here in nine that makes no sense
138:42 - oh yeah here it is oh look
138:47 - [Music]
138:53 - by the way somebody sent me a clip that
138:57 - was like four seconds long it was a
138:59 - Google Drive link that was a auto-tuned
139:03 - puller to Cartesian thing but was like
139:05 - five seconds long wasn't this full song
139:07 - that is by I should I forgot to give
139:10 - credit to this song is from Yeol accion
139:12 - SoundCloud SoundCloud yo Lexie polar
139:20 - alright let me just go to soundcloud.com
139:23 - /eo lakh see so this is where this
139:27 - particular song comes from and this is
139:43 - here so the people were talking about
139:46 - gift is and I distracted me for a second
139:49 - oops no no no no no don't do that so uh
139:59 - this is what I want I want this code
140:06 - that I had before perfect
140:11 - and let me go I'm gonna do this not in
140:16 - the what the video I'm gonna do this
140:23 - not in
140:24 - [Music]
140:44 - so let me do the following I think does
140:52 - this is this the way I used to do this
140:54 - prototype gosh I think I need to be do
141:00 - this fresh oh I shouldn't do this now oh
141:04 - no its prototype g /b
141:38 - I'm just getting ready to do a tutorial
141:40 - that is ill-advised but I kind of wanted
141:48 - to do it this week wait where's that
141:56 - code they lose already I'm saying here
142:01 - we go
142:18 - lots of room here there we go and oh
142:29 - it's broke something's broken here okay
142:34 - whatever that's fine
142:36 - I don't really care
142:49 - and I need the CDN treasure just get
143:01 - from here
143:17 - and
144:03 - okay
144:05 - all right everybody so you might be
144:10 - wondering what's about to happen I'm not
144:13 - really entirely sure so what I want to
144:16 - do is two or three video tutorials about
144:21 - object oriented programming inheritance
144:24 - as it relates to maybe particles
144:27 - particle system or physics simulation
144:29 - design and I was going down this road
144:32 - apparently in almost exactly two years
144:37 - ago Wow two years ago to this day and I
144:42 - was doing it with es5 and like the
144:46 - prototype syntax directly and so I think
144:49 - what I would like to do is complete this
144:54 - with a little follow up video but really
144:57 - go into but really go into inheritance
145:02 - with es6 classes ok d t6 in the YouTube
145:11 - chat sends this link of their work so
145:14 - let me quickly go to twitter.com slash
145:19 - arts generative I think I'm gonna have
145:26 - just go to the ah lovely
145:32 - oh look some nice times table stuff is
145:34 - this the one I was supposed to look at
145:39 - 109 8 to 769 109 no this one this is
145:50 - this is really nice stuff it's beautiful
145:52 - thank you for sharing my in Visio is a
145:57 - bit physical thank you ok can I manage
146:05 - to do this I said I was gonna do it I
146:11 - want to back out of that but now that I
146:12 - said I didn't do I'm starting to feel
146:14 - like the need for lunch it's one o'clock
146:15 - I mean three hours is month two hours
146:17 - should be my limit
146:18 - three hours is my absolute limit so let
146:20 - me see if I can manage to power through
146:23 - a little bit longer the hearts the
146:36 - hearts where the hearts
146:54 - all right so the other thing that I need
146:57 - to do this is really unfortunate is
147:00 - recreate so I just wanted I want to find
147:04 - like what did I sort of like end up with
147:06 - on the whiteboard here okay okay all
147:14 - right I need to somewhat
147:20 - [Music]
147:26 - first image in the ten videos and photos
147:29 - oh this one oh yeah I saw this one oh
147:33 - yeah this is amazing I'm sorry this is a
147:36 - beautiful heart image I saw this the
147:38 - other day and it's so lovely and my
147:42 - brain is melting like like this heart is
147:46 - melting into beautiful rainbow colors
147:48 - maybe there's a way you could apply
147:49 - Perlin noise and make this animated loop
147:51 - sorry for like being dense and not being
147:54 - able to find that thank you for sharing
147:56 - that
147:57 - that is beautiful why doesn't it show up
148:00 - here that's so weird like oh whoa whoa
148:09 - and here it is animating Oh lovely wow
148:13 - look at all these so oh wow whoa okay
148:17 - okay okay uh-huh
148:18 - thank you so much to arts generative on
148:21 - Twitter for sharing these with me sorry
148:22 - for being kind of dense and not noticing
148:25 - oh wait wait wait wait wait
148:30 - [Music]
148:35 - that might be too loud long sound effect
148:38 - there is breaking news was just
148:39 - submitted to the website repo I'm being
148:44 - told if I go to the coding training calm
148:46 - under coding challenges under bouncing
148:50 - DVD logo bounce no no I don't see it I
148:56 - don't see it
148:57 - is it not merged yet is it not merged
149:00 - how am I supposed to find it if it's not
149:01 - merged let's go to website pull requests
149:08 - bouncing DVD logo this must be it
149:11 - this must be it bouncing video on how to
149:15 - create a bouncing DVD logo video here's
149:17 - the URL I guess this will get merged
149:19 - soon enough let's go to full view my
149:34 - work here is done I mean I didn't make
149:38 - this but thank you thank you to Orville
149:43 - chopper this is really quite we have to
149:59 - wait now so much for that job I mean I
150:05 - could talk about JavaScript prototypes
150:06 - any time come on
150:18 - maybe needs like a drum oh that was kind
150:31 - of the corner was it that was the corner
150:34 - [Music]
150:38 - it's really bouncing
150:44 - I think we're getting further away
151:08 - we're just getting further away now
151:11 - [Music]
151:25 - it never hits the corner she says round
151:27 - corners it says Anthony I feel like
151:30 - we're gonna get a nice Barry okay oh
151:39 - yeah that's close enough
151:44 - all right we're hitting the DVD corner
151:47 - you win a bell and a train whistle we'll
151:56 - see you next time where the prizes will
151:58 - be like a cup of water all right back to
152:09 - prototypes all right here's the here's
152:15 - the bad news everybody
152:16 - I need to somehow recreate this diet
152:21 - this stuff because I like in in theory
152:24 - on is this is this my good pen so I
152:31 - don't need to redraw all of this but I'm
152:34 - gonna say p1 X Y prototype okay p1 X Y
152:50 - proto tight and then that goes to
152:57 - particle dot prototype which has a show
152:59 - function particle dot prototype which
153:11 - has a show function and then it has this
153:13 - weird underscore proto and that goes to
153:20 - object dot prototype which has like
153:25 - object dot prototype
153:29 - not even know if this is right I really
153:35 - made this two years ago I've been doing
153:38 - this for that long this is crazy I mean
153:40 - I've been through just for much longer
153:42 - than that but that's YouTube video
153:44 - nonsense prototype that links down to
153:51 - here is that right yeah and this has
153:54 - other things like I think I was talking
153:58 - to has owned property so continuing this
154:04 - video from two years ago and then we
154:06 - could have like P 2 which has x and y
154:11 - and prototype okay so this is basically
154:20 - the diagram I had before all right so
154:30 - now what I need now what I need refresh
154:37 - this this video by the way has it a
154:43 - 6,000 views which is totally insane
154:46 - this got to have oh yeah this is this is
154:48 - a lot of thumbs down a lot of thumbs
154:51 - down a lot of thumbs out on that one
154:53 - whoop alright so now I just need I need
154:57 - a little cheat sheet here I need a
155:05 - little cheat sheet which is my old olden
155:12 - days where - where would I have one of
155:17 - my historical inheritance with prototype
155:22 - examples well I think I've converted
155:25 - everything
155:32 - like what I'm I hold on javascript
155:38 - prototype inheritance let me just see
155:45 - yeah yeah yeah this looking on my
155:52 - invisible computer for the way I used to
155:59 - do this
156:00 - I guess well I should look for it on
156:01 - this computer hold on I have an idea
156:08 - oh I know how I could do this nature of
156:12 - code okay I know exactly what to do so
156:20 - I'm looking for this and then I want to
156:25 - go to like here and then I have this
156:28 - inheritance example and if I look at it
156:36 - it's using extends but if I go into the
156:41 - history of this file yes six updates es6
156:53 - inheritance so probably if I go to this
156:55 - version of the file yeah now how do i
157:03 - browse the file view file no no not that
157:06 - one view file yeah here we go so this is
157:12 - my ol okay great
157:15 - except there's this shouldn't be here
157:17 - but that's fine okay this is what I need
157:22 - I think I can actually remember this but
157:27 - it'll be my reference just in case okay
157:32 - all right I think I'm ready for this
157:35 - great with this very bad idea
157:38 - on this no good very bad terrible idea
157:44 - day
157:47 - the problem with me doing this is I
157:49 - really should only be doing this if I'm
157:51 - also going to do the es6 ones but such
157:56 - is life it'll have to wait till next
157:58 - week because I got obsessed with the
158:01 - noise loop thing the water is gone I've
158:11 - got 24 minutes before I turn into a
158:13 - pumpkin and here we are
158:25 - okay hi everyone I am doing something
158:30 - very ill-advised I think in this video
158:33 - but I were trying a completionist and
158:35 - I'm returning to something I made a
158:37 - video apparently almost today's February
158:41 - 20th 2019 and I made this video February
158:44 - 22nd
158:45 - 2017 almost to the day two years ago
158:48 - about prototypes in JavaScript because I
158:51 - was on this path towards explaining a
158:53 - concept known as inheritance and also
158:56 - another concept known as polymorphism
158:58 - now I do have videos about
158:59 - object-oriented programming
159:01 - inheritance and polymorphism in Java
159:03 - with the processing development
159:05 - environment you could go and watch those
159:06 - and I also intend that my what I really
159:10 - should be doing with my time right now
159:12 - is making a video about inheritance with
159:14 - es6 classes in JavaScript and that's
159:16 - coming and that's the video you should
159:17 - go and watch but I I just I can't let
159:20 - this go I at the very end of this video
159:22 - I said and then I'll make a follow-up
159:24 - one about inheritance using prototypes
159:26 - of JavaScript and I never did and
159:28 - perhaps perhaps there's a kernel of
159:31 - value here in that yes six classes is
159:35 - really just what's referred to as like
159:37 - syntactic sugar and I do have a sweet
159:38 - tooth over you truly everything
159:43 - javascript is still a prototype based
159:47 - object language so understanding how
159:50 - these prototypes work and how this
159:52 - concept i've inherited applies to them
159:54 - is perhaps useful so if you're still
159:57 - with me i'm gonna try to explore
159:58 - inheritance with prototypes in
160:01 - javascript as a follow-up to this video
160:04 - 9.19 from two years ago so if you watch
160:07 - they've maybe just maybe literally just
160:09 - watched that video and somehow ended up
160:11 - here which would be kind of amazing if
160:13 - you did you might have seen it that I
160:15 - had this diagram and the idea this
160:17 - diagram is I was trying to explain that
160:19 - I want to I'm programming a particle
160:21 - system and there's going to be particles
160:22 - moving around my canvas and I have
160:24 - multiple particle objects each of those
160:26 - particle objects has its own XY position
160:29 - p1 as an X Y P 2 as an X Y but the
160:32 - functionality is tied to particle dot
160:36 - prototype so I've added a show
160:38 - function that draws the particle as part
160:40 - of the prototype and there is this idea
160:42 - of a prototype chain meaning that
160:46 - everything descends from object dot
160:48 - prototype so if we call a function or
160:51 - look at a property of an object we first
160:53 - see if it's that object's own property
160:56 - or is it somewhere up the prototype
160:58 - chain so what would it mean now if what
161:01 - I want to do is create a new kind of
161:06 - object I think in my nature of code book
161:09 - I call it confetti which is kind of like
161:11 - a random weird thing but I just use that
161:14 - for this cuz I can't think of anything
161:16 - else right now if I were to create an
161:18 - object something called confetti and a
161:22 - new prototype a class again es6 classes
161:26 - the way I do this now is with es6
161:27 - classes I don't do this anymore but I'm
161:29 - just exploring it cuz I can't help
161:32 - myself
161:33 - confetti dot prototype what I want is I
161:39 - want confetti dot prototype to inherit
161:42 - everything from particle dot prototype
161:45 - but maybe have its own additional
161:47 - function I don't know like maybe it has
161:49 - a function called burst so it gets show
161:53 - somehow it's going to get you I don't
161:54 - have to rewrite the show function it's a
161:56 - special kind of particle that somehow
162:00 - inherits that so let's let's see how
162:02 - would we do that ok so coming back to
162:05 - the code I don't really know this a try
162:09 - don't worry I have my cheat sheet over
162:11 - here of my actual example from the
162:13 - nature of code book if I need to refer
162:15 - to it alright so let's go to the code
162:16 - the idea here is okay I am going to
162:20 - write a new class called confetti but
162:27 - it's not a class I'm this is an old old
162:29 - way of doing stuff with this idea of a
162:31 - constructor function because the idea
162:33 - here is I want to say now I'm gonna have
162:35 - it okay I was even using var so I'll
162:37 - keep music var because I'm living in the
162:39 - past today C and C is a new confetti I
162:44 - want to be able to say like C dot show
162:47 - for example I want to be able to call
162:50 - that function
162:51 - so right now if I were to run this code
162:53 - I have this loaded here see dot show is
162:57 - not a function okay so how do I have
163:00 - confetti inherit everything from
163:04 - particle so I think what I do is I can
163:07 - say particle I wrote I don't even
163:13 - remember I hope to look at my cheat
163:19 - sheet particles I thought I was right I
163:22 - was right Park hold I call particles I
163:24 - call they knew that's what it was I'm
163:34 - gonna type so okay so the first thing
163:37 - that I'm gonna do is in the constructor
163:38 - function I'm gonna say particle dot call
163:42 - this oh this is so weird but what the I
163:45 - oh I don't like this at all but what
163:48 - this is doing is it's basically saying
163:51 - execute the constructor function of
163:54 - particle just do what I do when I am a
163:58 - particle so let's take a look let's not
164:01 - do C dot show but let's console log p
164:05 - and console dot log C so we're gonna
164:07 - look at the particle object and the
164:09 - confetti object now hit refresh so look
164:12 - at this both particle and confetti both
164:15 - have an X and a y at 99 you can see they
164:18 - have those properties they both descend
164:21 - from object and if we go into here we
164:25 - see that particle has its own show
164:28 - function and then it gets a whole bunch
164:30 - of other things from object but confetti
164:33 - up it doesn't have the show function it
164:38 - just has all the things from object okay
164:41 - so how do I linked it to well one way to
164:46 - link the two is by saying confetti
164:52 - by saying confetti dot prototype I have
164:59 - to look it up ever date anything
165:02 - I'm gonna edit out to be looking it up
165:04 - right that's what I thought oh yeah yeah
165:06 - object I create ah aha oh yeah yeah okay
165:10 - okay okay so one way to link the two
165:17 - would be to say okay you know what
165:19 - confetti dot prototype should be the
165:24 - same as particles prototype so I want to
165:27 - set the confetti prototype to particles
165:30 - prototype now this is not a good idea I
165:32 - don't think but let's just for the sake
165:33 - of our unit let's put that in our code
165:35 - and let me let me refresh this we can
165:39 - see okay oh look the show function
165:43 - showed up there fascinating amazing well
165:47 - maybe we're done we inherited the show
165:50 - function great oh and look the
165:54 - constructor is even the particle
165:56 - constructor perfect all this is great
165:58 - done finished I'm out of here
166:00 - wait I think there's a problem so this
166:02 - is a bad idea because we actually don't
166:06 - want to set it equal this could cause us
166:09 - problems and what we actually want to do
166:11 - all the I the idea of prototype is to
166:14 - base an object off of other objects and
166:17 - it would it and in order to do this
166:20 - properly we need to say object create
166:23 - particle dot prototype we want to make
166:26 - sure we make a new object that is based
166:28 - on the particles prototype itself and
166:32 - that's what we're actually pointing to
166:33 - not directly to the prototype okay so
166:36 - let me just add that in and I'm gonna
166:38 - hit refresh again
166:40 - wait no here we are here we are and
166:49 - great why do I have to do that do I
166:53 - really have to do that hold on I don't
166:56 - actually know about this stuff can we
167:00 - just forget that prototypical
167:02 - inheritance exists oh I see that David
167:10 - also made like this really cool looping
167:12 - gif yes I would follow these classes
167:15 - over
167:15 - the tapes don't do this wait why do you
167:18 - need could someone explain to me why I
167:22 - needed to do that I'm looking at this
167:29 - like where is this gonna cause a problem
167:37 - like what if on to see yeah I guess I
167:50 - could just I think I shouldn't make this
167:53 - video if someone could explain me why
167:59 - I'm supposed to do that
168:01 - that would be great yeah okay I see
168:19 - if you do ah thank you thank you
168:23 - that's why thank you me I am so me wow
168:29 - that's totally it
168:31 - okay thank you okay
168:40 - okay thank you
168:45 - so let me go back
168:55 - while this looks right I am now have a
168:59 - confetti object that inherits sho from
169:02 - particle because I've tied the
169:05 - prototypes together this is a terrible
169:07 - idea so I'm gonna show you in a minute
169:09 - why this is a terrible idea but let's
169:11 - leave it this way just for a little bit
169:13 - longer why am I doing this in the first
169:15 - place
169:16 - the idea is that you like the idea here
169:19 - is that this particle prototype this
169:22 - particle object it's good night in if
169:25 - you if you're looking at some my other
169:26 - examples has a lot of stuff to it maybe
169:28 - it has this whole like set of physics
169:30 - algorithms built into it and I want to
169:33 - just create a new kind of object that
169:34 - includes all of that physics stuff but I
169:37 - can just draw it in a different way so
169:39 - let's just try to like simulate that for
169:41 - a little bit by what I'm gonna do is I'm
169:43 - gonna add now another function to
169:46 - particle called update and what I'm
169:52 - going to do in that function is I'm
169:53 - going to say this dot X plus equal and
169:56 - I'm using p5 so I can use random
169:58 - negative I'm going to I'm just going to
170:00 - move the X and the y around randomly so
170:03 - imagine this is like a really elaborate
170:05 - physics simulation that I've worked out
170:08 - for how this particle should move really
170:09 - I'm just moving it randomly so now what
170:12 - I want to do is I am going to now add
170:14 - the draw function the draw function will
170:17 - loop and I can say P dot update P dot
170:21 - show C dot update a C dot show and what
170:25 - I'll have now Animus a background 0 and
170:28 - I'm gonna just make sure I can really
170:30 - see this by saying stroke 255 and stroke
170:34 - weight 8 so I should see if I go back to
170:39 - here two little dots dancing around what
170:43 - is the particle object one is the
170:45 - confetti object the wonderful thing here
170:47 - is my confetti object which sorry I am
170:52 - going to now which is now C so I have C
170:59 - a confetti object I have P a particle
171:01 - object
171:02 - this links to confetti dot prototype but
171:07 - confetti dot prototype and particle dot
171:09 - prototype right now are equal they're
171:11 - the same thing
171:12 - so it's actually as if this is linking
171:15 - directly to particles not prototype so
171:17 - the show function it's getting is right
171:19 - here and there's also now an update
171:21 - function okay so my confetti object has
171:25 - both an updated to show function and its
171:28 - own X&Y the particle has its own X&Y and
171:31 - an update in to show function so what I
171:32 - want to do is I want my confetti object
171:34 - to inherit this update function but I
171:38 - wanted to have its own show function I
171:40 - want to have its own show function I
171:42 - want it to draw itself in a different
171:44 - way maybe as a square with some color or
171:46 - something like that so let's go back
171:48 - here and what I'm gonna do is say okay
171:51 - no problem what I want to do now is say
171:56 - that confetti dot prototype I can type I
172:04 - could type okay that's a copy-paste that
172:06 - dot prototype dot show equals function
172:11 - and I'm gonna just do something totally
172:13 - different
172:16 - I'm going to give it us I'm gonna say
172:21 - stroke 255 0 255 I'm gonna say Phil no
172:26 - Phil and I'm gonna draw this as a square
172:30 - with a side length of 50 and now I'm
172:34 - gonna hit enter and what's going on
172:39 - why why why why isn't the confetti
172:44 - calling it's show function the reason
172:47 - why it's not well okay well okay well
172:50 - maybe I need to do this after after I do
172:52 - this confetti dot prototype equals
172:54 - particle dye prototype ha
172:57 - wait now they're both showing like
172:59 - confetti either both I want them to do
173:01 - the same update function but I want them
173:02 - to do different show functions so why is
173:04 - that not working it's because I can't
173:07 - actually the way that the prototypical
173:09 - inheritance chain thing works is I can't
173:12 - set confetti prototype
173:13 - equal to this I basically overwritten it
173:15 - so it's as if there aren't two separate
173:18 - ones I want to base this on that not
173:20 - overwrite it and the way to do that it's
173:22 - what kind of ridiculous and this is why
173:24 - the es6 classes methodology that you
173:26 - should just turn this video off and go
173:28 - use instead is I have to say right here
173:33 - object dot create particle prototype
173:37 - it's basically making a new prototype
173:41 - based on the particles prototype but I
173:44 - can modify it so once I've done that and
173:47 - I hit enter now you can see I have both
173:51 - of them are using the same update
173:52 - function but one has its own show
173:55 - function and let me show you we're gonna
173:56 - see this in the console in a way that
173:58 - hopefully will bring this all together
173:59 - in a way that makes sense so look at
174:01 - this they each have their own XY that's
174:04 - good because that XY property is added
174:08 - in the constructor function which both
174:11 - the particle constructor function and
174:13 - the confetti constructor function call
174:16 - the particle object has a show and an
174:20 - update function as part of itself but
174:24 - look at this now the confetti object has
174:28 - its own show function but oops sorry but
174:34 - it's update function is down here
174:36 - because it points to the particle so
174:39 - this is the chain confetti particle is
174:42 - kind of has its own show and update
174:44 - confetti as an X Y its own show but it
174:47 - also has a show and update which it
174:48 - copied from particle now the reason why
174:50 - it doesn't call this one is it always
174:52 - looks for the first instance of
174:54 - something up that prototype chain so
174:56 - this is wildly confusing and convoluted
174:58 - hopefully this gives you a little
174:59 - background its sense of how this works
175:02 - but there's one other missing piece of
175:06 - this I believe which sorry there's one
175:16 - other missing piece of this I believe
175:17 - which relates to this here the confetti
175:21 - the confetti object doesn't actually
175:25 - have its own control
175:27 - sure really it should so for example if
175:29 - I wanted to do something like I'm just
175:31 - gonna add right here like I want to do
175:32 - something else like console.log hello
175:35 - this is confetti like in addition to
175:40 - initializing this object the way a
175:42 - particle does I want to do something
175:43 - else actually maybe what I want to do is
175:45 - give it a color this dot color equals a
175:48 - new color that is pink and then actually
175:53 - what I'm doing is I'm calling that under
175:56 - stroke I'm referencing the confetti has
175:59 - a color like the the particle gets in
176:01 - X&Y the confetti gets in X&Y and a color
176:04 - let's see what happens here
176:05 - Oh weird weirdly that worked so I
176:19 - thought I needed this other step which
176:23 - is this confetti prototype constructor
176:25 - equals confetti so is this really
176:28 - unnecessary can we just put that in here
176:33 - all right because if I go back to here
176:38 - the constructor is pointing to particle
176:43 - if i refresh now it has the constructor
176:51 - the confetti constructor which is what I
176:52 - want huh well I mean that seems like
176:59 - important but it worked anyway
177:10 - hmm where you be I am so be is typing
177:15 - [Laughter]
177:17 - what is disaster the 1:30 yet that's
177:20 - when I'm leaving
177:20 - I think constructor let's use type of
177:24 - correctly so that's the that's the issue
177:31 - or you could inherit from it interesting
177:39 - so the real CR for XY is recommending
177:45 - some other YouTube video to watch we
177:47 - took probably should have done before I
177:49 - started on this bad so maybe it's just
177:52 - the type of thing okay it's a minor
177:54 - detail
177:56 - but let's try that C type of particle
178:12 - no wait how do I use type of oh it
178:23 - returns it not a boolean sorry thank you
178:31 - very much
178:34 - that's not oh no no no those are
178:37 - functions ah it's of the variable yeah
178:39 - no this is right type of C object oh
178:44 - thanks that's really great thank you
178:48 - very much
178:49 - I mean maybe it's just it makes it a
178:59 - cleaner but there's how do I get the
179:04 - class name get
179:17 - it's still prince2 instance of thank you
179:20 - that's what I'm looking for
179:21 - maybe that's what C P instance of
179:25 - particle true instance of confetti false
179:30 - okay see instance of particle true
179:35 - confetti also true
179:37 - it's useless unless I didn't reload it
179:41 - well let me take that out maybe I didn't
179:43 - reload it true particle true P instance
179:56 - of confetti false no everything is
179:59 - working the way it should
180:00 - let's put this in I think this is
180:02 - actually completely useless see instance
180:07 - of confetti true particle true it's the
180:11 - same false particle true it looks like
180:21 - it's a bi MCB rights which I agree with
180:23 - it looks like it's somewhat of a
180:24 - standard with no actual meaning useful
180:27 - for if you're constructing types
180:28 - dynamically but not useful otherwise
180:30 - okay so anyway I'm going to mention it
180:33 - but but
180:47 - so interestingly enough this worked
180:49 - anyway I thought I needed this other
180:51 - step in order for it to call the
180:55 - confetti constructor properly here if
180:58 - I'm saying new particle versus new
181:02 - confetti it looks like it works anyway
181:03 - but I'm going to show you what this step
181:05 - is really one thing one thing that's
181:07 - kind of missing here is that in if I
181:10 - look in the prototype here the particles
181:13 - constructor is pointed to this particle
181:17 - function and if I go here into the
181:20 - confetti you can see like oh there is no
181:22 - constructor it's getting it from the
181:24 - prototype chain which is incorrect the
181:26 - confetti object should have its own
181:28 - constructor and so a way to do that is
181:31 - to say I think it's to say actually I
181:36 - have this line of code here in mind from
181:38 - my example I'm just gonna copy it in
181:39 - that's what it is to say this confetti
181:42 - dot prototype constructor equals the
181:45 - confetti function right I want to like
181:47 - specifically assign it that and it seems
181:50 - to me that this is just a convention to
181:52 - kind of clean things up I can't actually
181:53 - find a place where I need that in order
181:56 - to write code to run correctly but I'm
181:59 - gonna leave it in there and so now I'm
182:01 - gonna hit refresh and we can see here
182:03 - that a confetti object inherits
182:08 - everything from particle including it
182:11 - gets its own X&Y and it gets a show
182:14 - function sorry sorry and it gets a show
182:17 - and an update function it has its own
182:20 - constructor and its own show function
182:22 - because I wanted to modify the confetti
182:24 - show function from the particle show oh
182:26 - don't worry
182:28 - if none of this made any sense to you
182:29 - that's okay
182:31 - um this is confusing and weird but this
182:33 - is underneath the hood how all of this
182:36 - stuff is linked together in the
182:38 - implementation of the JavaScript
182:40 - programming language itself this is the
182:42 - prototype inheritance chain I can
182:45 - basically create a new object with its
182:49 - own function calling the other objects
182:52 - constructor function and then attaching
182:56 - its prototype to a new object based on
182:58 - another object's prototype it's really
183:00 - weird and kind of awful but this is how
183:03 - I used to make my examples but don't
183:05 - worry oh there's a new way I make these
183:08 - examples well you don't have to worry
183:10 - about this anymore you can skip to I
183:12 - haven't made it yet but soon enough
183:13 - within the next week or two I will be
183:15 - uploading and publishing a video all
183:17 - about inheritance in JavaScript using
183:20 - es6 classes and in those videos I really
183:23 - talk about the theory behind inheritance
183:25 - why it's useful and how to put it into
183:27 - practice in JavaScript so if you
183:29 - actually made it through watching this
183:30 - video thank you
183:31 - hopefully this helped add a little
183:34 - something to your day and I'll see you
183:36 - maybe in those es6 classes videos thanks
183:39 - good bye alright alright it's 1:30 I
183:49 - have to go I don't know if I should
183:52 - release this video without having made
183:53 - the other ones we'll see Nico is asking
183:58 - can you please put the full live online
184:00 - as well for this one so the whole live
184:04 - stream will stay archived as soon as I
184:07 - hit stop streaming so you don't have to
184:10 - worry about that and then also edited
184:14 - versions will be uploaded separately so
184:15 - I always leave everything online unless
184:17 - you know I guess I reserve the right to
184:19 - take it down if there was some big
184:20 - problem but I haven't not yet to date
184:22 - taking a live stream down and apparently
184:24 - this is like live stream number 160
184:27 - something so let me just check for any
184:31 - thank yous here so we had looks like we
184:36 - had new member cryptic who also super
184:42 - chatted with a comment try a coding
184:44 - train try a coding train with Perlin
184:46 - noise looping smoke who interesting that
184:49 - would be like - Luke the the z-axis in a
184:52 - way like to do a tourist basically or a
184:55 - sphere or something like that to loop
184:57 - the Z value around back to the beginning
185:01 - I've been live streaming for 3 hours I
185:02 - don't think I'll be able to get to that
185:04 - today but I do love that idea and would
185:05 - like
185:05 - to try it so thank you to everyone who
185:10 - joined today I appreciate it I
185:13 - appreciate you maybe I could go back to
185:16 - a slightly happier place
185:20 - and just open this and this is where I'm
185:28 - going to finish why did it not work by
185:31 - the way when I go to full let's try this
185:34 - I go to full test test test it is why is
185:40 - it not getting the audio in there's no
185:43 - error in the console it's so strange
185:45 - what if I do present hello test test
185:51 - really weird but if I go to sketch oops
185:59 - sketches and hit play gets the audio how
186:02 - weird all right so thank you everyone
186:10 - I'll be back next Wednesday let me check
186:12 - my calendar
186:13 - next Wednesday 10:30 and Eastern I gotta
186:17 - work on this date and API that's coming
186:20 - next week look at my calendar I see
186:24 - nothing see nothing telling me that next
186:27 - February 27th there's no reason why I
186:29 - wouldn't be here so next Wednesday I
186:31 - mean if I could sneak in some time I
186:33 - would love to come back and do the es6
186:35 - classes inheritance stuff tomorrow or
186:37 - Friday or Monday or Tuesday pretty
186:39 - unlikely that's gonna happen but I
186:42 - certainly will come back to it next week
186:45 - and George has Dan will you answer
186:50 - questions today well I I would be happy
186:53 - to answer a few questions if they appear
186:55 - in the chat you need to interact with
186:58 - the page before we can use the audio or
187:00 - mic I think I think that's true that is
187:02 - true so how do I so what if I have an
187:05 - idea let's put this in mousepressed
187:13 - so I won't start the mic until
187:16 - mousepressed and but I think I could do
187:20 - this so that it's not null let's try
187:24 - this hello
187:31 - No
187:33 - okay so hold ah what if I do this and
187:42 - just say if Mike I know the camera just
187:48 - went off so if I do this and then I
187:51 - click it starts and Eitan asks do you
188:08 - work at a company so my full-time job is
188:11 - teaching at a program called ITP and
188:14 - also ima ITP as the graduate program ima
188:16 - is the undergraduate program and to
188:18 - School of the Arts in New York
188:19 - University and that's actually where I
188:21 - am I'm in the Tisch building the closet
188:24 - where I thought up some cameras and I do
188:26 - this alright let's try this
188:31 - No
188:32 - so weird the I know that that's there's
188:34 - like a weird chrome thing all right I'm
188:38 - not gonna worry about this it's so sort
188:40 - of silly oops
188:43 - sketches I guess I just was like I don't
188:45 - know why I was I was gonna try to put
188:47 - this on the screen
189:09 - all right this is my goodbye song for
189:15 - reference what time is it now
189:17 - 138 p.m. by the way when I went to get
189:20 - water was snowing it inside of you I
189:23 - wonder if it still is
189:27 - according to Web Audio API pop privacy
189:30 - policy in Chrome Safari and Firefox
189:32 - usually I do audio context 8 equals
189:35 - resume after the direction try the embed
189:40 - version not the full one yeah these are
189:42 - all good suggestions alright goodbye
189:46 - everybody thank you so much I will see
189:51 - you next Wednesday I'm fading myself out
189:54 - whoops no I'm using my microphone and I
189:59 - will hit stop streaming in a minute or
190:00 - two
190:02 - [Music]
190:50 - just coming back to say hi to you Lexi
190:53 - hi Alexi thank you for the Florida
190:56 - Cartesian coordinates on did you call
190:57 - somebody share to be a short clip of the
191:00 - Google Drive link I know what it was it
191:01 - was very similar but you hey but it
191:03 - wasn't you what did you make up earlier
191:05 - versions like a short clip they by
191:07 - everybody
191:08 - [Music]
