13:34 - year I'll get a professional musician
13:37 - but I'm gonna attempt it if it bothers
13:39 - your ears
13:41 - mute um very poorly to sing some coding

15:47 - uh here's here by the way if you want to
15:50 - contribute to what's going to happen
15:51 - today beyond the coding stuff is if you
15:54 - go to the holiday songs um GitHub repo
15:58 - you you can just file an issue or a poll
16:00 - request there's even one already live
16:02 - and active right here create coding
16:04 - train Jingle Bells okay here we go um
16:09 - should probably vet this first coding
16:11 - train coding train
16:12 - this. I love that okay so we are going
16:15 - to um we're going to merge this in I
16:19 - really need to talk about the

16:27 - one here we go
16:29 - since Simon gave a donation when there's
16:31 - a donation I will sing a song so one
16:33 - thing you could really really do that
16:34 - would be awesome not required not
16:36 - required you can put the chords in here
16:39 - I'll show you how I I did that for the
16:41 - let it code one which was submitted by
16:45 - um uh this was submitted by and let me
16:48 - find it here
16:52 - um submitted by elst preacher on GitHub
16:56 - created this let it code to the T of Let
16:58 - It Snow and also and all I want is for
17:01 - code to run which will definitely happen
17:03 - at some point uh so I'm looking for the
17:06 - coding train Jingle Bells which is right
17:08 - here oh and I was going to show you that
17:11 - if I go to the let it code markdown file
17:15 - this morning see this is the thing I
17:16 - prepared no code for today but I did
17:19 - spend about 15 minutes trying to put the
17:21 - cords in with the lyrics cuz I don't
17:24 - have any of this I don't know what I'm
17:25 - doing here I but also have this sheet of
17:27 - paper here that has like the actual
17:29 - chords on it this by the way I also have
17:31 - to thank Cynthia Lynn um I think if you
17:33 - Google Cynthia Lynn ukulele you'll find
17:36 - her work I've watched many of her
17:38 - ukulele tutorials on
17:40 - YouTube uh uh to learn to play a little
17:43 - bit um and so let's see if we can
17:46 - do
17:48 - um let's see if we can do our coding
17:50 - train Jingle Bells now do I have that so
17:55 - the other thing I
17:57 - have at hand here
18:02 - came came last night um arrived in the
18:06 - mail for me is 100 holiday songs I
18:10 - suppose it actually says Christmas
18:11 - carols here but I'm trying to be as
18:13 - holiday secular as possible with this
18:16 - live stream I mean that'll be impossible
18:18 - but um and there's got to be a jingle
18:21 - bells in here right it's got 100 songs
18:24 - I'm looking under
18:25 - Jay maybe we should uh there's no Jingle
18:29 - Bells in here because it's not is that
18:32 - not technically a
18:36 - um Christmas
18:38 - Carol jingle
18:42 - bells jingle bells I mean there got to
18:45 - be so few chords right somebody somebody
18:48 - watching put the chords in here for just
18:50 - these six lines and I will come back and
18:53 - sing that in a second because first I
18:54 - want to talk about what is really the
18:56 - important aspect of today
19:00 - um and that
19:03 - is um the processing Foundation
19:06 - fundraiser so um let me start by going
19:10 - to uh donorbox oh let me H let me start
19:13 - by going
19:14 - twitter.com processing
19:18 - org and um I think actually my tweet
19:22 - here will
19:23 - have the uh donate link Okay so
19:30 - so let me start by going to
19:32 - here so this is the campaign uh support
19:36 - P5 this giving season I I I would
19:39 - say so you can now um donate either via
19:43 - this web page or via the
19:47 - um or with the link that's on this live
19:50 - stream page that I believe is there and
19:51 - I'm going to pull it up here on my
19:54 - other uh computer CU I should see a
19:57 - notification or something pop up if
19:59 - somebody donates I haven't yet figured
20:01 - out to see that um so those are the two
20:04 - places you could donate um and there are
20:07 - a bunch of rewards and giveaways um that
20:10 - are part of this campaign drive that you
20:12 - can that I'm going to show you and talk
20:13 - about here in a minute I just want to be
20:15 - clear that uh thank you to YouTube uh in
20:19 - particular Dorene who's my YouTube
20:20 - Partner manager who I must have sent
20:23 - probably a 100 emails in the last two
20:25 - weeks asking for this fundraiser feature
20:27 - to be unlocked on my channel um so thank
20:32 - you so much for having that this program
20:34 - um any 501c3 nonprofit uh Foundation
20:37 - charity can be uh part of a YouTube
20:40 - giving campaign I think a lot of the
20:42 - stuff is in beta so I was able to get
20:44 - access to that um YouTube covers all the
20:46 - transaction fees so from what I've been
20:48 - told and what I understand if you donate
20:51 - um and I guess I could just go to the
20:52 - live stream here but if you donate on
20:54 - what would be on the right hand side of
20:56 - your screen or with the chat viaa that
20:57 - donate button um that money will go to
21:00 - the processing foundation and there will
21:01 - be no fees taken out of it um I also
21:05 - however want to say though that um this
21:07 - is your uh clear path to donating where
21:10 - the processing foundation will get your
21:13 - information to send you a thank you and
21:15 - also depending on if you're donating one
21:17 - of these donor tiers to receive your
21:19 - gifts so I don't think that if you
21:21 - donate through YouTube the money makes
21:22 - its way to the foundation but um you
21:26 - don't I don't know that we get your name
21:28 - or any information to thank you but I
21:30 - will thank you here um if you donate and
21:34 - in fact I am going to match so let's see
21:37 - whatever there's got to be a way for me
21:38 - to see this if I just go to like YouTube
21:40 - the coding
21:41 - train um I'm always hesitant to pull up
21:44 - the chat but why not if I go here I am
21:47 - going to match personally any donations
21:50 - that come through up to $1,000 here so
21:52 - right now at the end of this live stream
21:54 - I am also going to give $162 to the
21:57 - processing Foundation
21:58 - and I suppose I if I can figure out the
22:01 - amount that came into the donor box page
22:03 - during this time I will also include
22:05 - that up to um $1,000 so um thank you
22:10 - everyone for why why should you donate
22:12 - now a lot of you might be watching just
22:15 - because you enjoy the channel and the
22:17 - weird stuff that I do that's great and
22:19 - aren't able to donate that is absolutely
22:22 - fine you are welcome here I realize that
22:23 - not everyone is in a position um to give
22:26 - to give money um there other ways to
22:28 - support um the processing Foundation of
22:31 - course and I can talk about through your
22:33 - um through just being part of the
22:34 - community which I will also mention and
22:36 - talk about during this live stream um
22:39 - but let me first talk about why this um
22:42 - support P5 and by the way this should
22:44 - say this is where I got this wrong that
22:45 - should say support P5 that's the hashtag
22:48 - people um why this is important so you
22:51 - know let me start with this pitch to you
22:55 - what you let's say you are a creative
22:57 - artist a cre creative coder somebody who
22:59 - works and makes stuff on your computer
23:01 - perhaps you've you you use software
23:03 - tools like Adobe Creative Suite that I
23:06 - don't know what is the going rate for
23:08 - Adobe Creative Suite these
23:10 - days um $30 a month no yeah my watch is
23:16 - trying to answer the question for me uh
23:18 - $30 a month I don't know it's quite a
23:21 - bit processing and P5 just Library are
23:25 - free they are maintained by volunteers
23:28 - by people who are paid through
23:29 - Fellowship programs and other types of
23:30 - stipend to um an Institutional support
23:33 - to work on that software we're small um
23:36 - a lot of people are donating their time
23:38 - or even if they're being paid working
23:40 - additional hours on top of other a lot
23:42 - of other
23:43 - responsibilities um and um these
23:46 - software projects don't just happen by
23:48 - Magic and volunteer unpaid labor is not
23:51 - enough to sustain these projects it may
23:54 - have been in the past and there may be
23:55 - some people who are in a privilege
23:58 - position where they can donate their
23:59 - time but a lot of people can't and to
24:01 - have the most inclusive and healthy
24:03 - open-source Library uh we need to pay
24:06 - people and so processing Foundation is
24:09 - raising money um uh um there's a a
24:13 - medium article uh which will go through
24:15 - this quite a bit more to help sustain
24:18 - the software projects so let me mention
24:20 - to you what those software projects are
24:22 - processing Foundation processing the
24:25 - Java based processing which started all
24:27 - was 20 years
24:30 - ago p5js uh so processing in case you're
24:34 - not aware of the history was created by
24:36 - Ben fry Ben Benjamin I like to say I
24:38 - don't know if anybody calls him that but
24:39 - I say hey Benjamin Benjamin are you
24:41 - watching Ben fry and Casey Reese while
24:44 - they were students at the MIT media lab
24:46 - in 2001 that's the original Genesis of
24:49 - all of all of what I'm talking about and
24:51 - uh
24:52 - today p5js if I'm correct began as a
24:56 - project in 2013 which somehow is like
24:58 - six years ago I don't know how that's
25:01 - possible um Lauren McCarthy uh created
25:04 - that project along with Evelyn Eastman
25:06 - and Lauren McCarthy has been leading
25:07 - that project for years and years um so
25:10 - many people have contributed I couldn't
25:12 - possibly name them all although I
25:13 - hopefully I can come up with some to
25:15 - mention over the course of this live
25:16 - stream but I I do want to give a special
25:18 - shout out to Cassie Terian who created
25:20 - the P5 web editor that I use in all of
25:24 - my teaching and all of the stuff on the
25:25 - coding train so
25:28 - um um so those are some people to
25:30 - mention um there's processing Pi which
25:33 - is processing python um uh Jonathan oh
25:38 - why am I playing on I'm the
25:40 - [Laughter]
25:42 - worst prepare uh let's go let's go to
25:44 - processing.org there's the python mode
25:47 - of processing there's processing. piy
25:49 - which is a
25:51 - um hey this season we look at that
25:54 - that's great where's the usually there's
25:56 - like this like bar bar across the top
25:58 - that goes to other projects
26:02 - um oh there we go uh this this is why I
26:05 - just want to mention these so there's
26:05 - processing. py um why am I forgetting
26:08 - fineberg Jonathan fineberg I remembered
26:10 - it popped into my head I'm sorry
26:12 - Jonathan fineberg uh processing for
26:14 - Android created by Andre kbri uh
26:17 - processing for the pie created by gotf
26:19 - freed hater uh Ryan
26:22 - Brown Ryan Brown donated $50 to the
26:25 - processing Foundation thank you so much
26:27 - I just that I tried to get this thing
26:29 - where an overlay would Pop Up when
26:30 - somebody donates because it does that
26:32 - YouTube will send through the RPI alerts
26:35 - through super chats but I don't know how
26:37 - to do that with the um donations um so
26:39 - code Marshall is saying sorry you can't
26:41 - donate in this country or region yet so
26:42 - that might be true for you I will remind
26:44 - you that all you need to do is look in
26:46 - this video's description and there is a
26:48 - link to this donor box page I believe
26:51 - this will take donations from any region
26:54 - through uh whatever kinds of online
26:57 - credit card hard PayPal things you can
27:00 - do so all of these projects uh that are
27:03 - up here in order to sustain them um um
27:06 - we're raising money in a new way uh we
27:09 - do we've been lucky and uh thank you so
27:11 - much to Dorothy Santos who is the
27:13 - program manager for the processing
27:14 - Foundation who uh you should thank and
27:16 - give claps and shout outs to on Twitter
27:19 - or wherever or or any other social media
27:21 - where you can or at an event if you if
27:23 - you see them um but uh we have been uh
27:26 - doing well in terms of getting some
27:28 - grants uh and institutional support
27:31 - thanks to large part to to their efforts
27:34 - um and um but we could we need more and
27:37 - one of the things that I think that I
27:39 - really want to talk about here um and
27:41 - let me find this by going to medium.com
27:44 - processing
27:46 - foundation and first of all check out
27:49 - create canvas this is the kind of thing
27:51 - you're also supporting this is a
27:52 - wonderful new podcast called create
27:54 - canvas that's been spearheaded by uh
27:56 - saber con the uh education Community uh
27:59 - manager for the processing foundation
28:01 - and Johanna Heda who's the director of
28:03 - advocacy I hope I'm getting these
28:04 - people's titles correct um and Sharon
28:08 - Del delar Cruz is a former processing
28:10 - Foundation fellow for actually former
28:12 - student at ITP where I teach but that's
28:14 - a separate thing um she is absolutely
28:16 - amazing and wonderful learn more about
28:18 - her work support but this is what I
28:20 - really want to highlight for you if you
28:22 - haven't uh if you know maybe you're just
28:25 - you want to just pay you're glued the
28:27 - screen to see me really poorly play the
28:30 - ukulele um but but um if you if you
28:35 - could after this is over uh or now if
28:37 - you want to take a break because what am
28:38 - I doing but nonsense um take the time to
28:41 - read this full article seven minutes out
28:43 - of your life to understand uh and the
28:46 - thought process and the goals for the
28:48 - future of the P5 GS project we would
28:50 - really like the P I would really like
28:52 - the P5 Jaz project to continue and I
28:54 - think a model um there's you know
28:56 - burnout is a thing that happens in a
28:59 - wide variety of communities and careers
29:01 - and uh all sorts of efforts from work
29:04 - rated activism related um you hear about
29:07 - it with like content creators on YouTube
29:08 - I think o burnout in open source is a
29:11 - thing that I have felt maybe you're
29:13 - watching this have felt if you're
29:14 - leading a project um how do you uh and
29:18 - and there is a time where you want to
29:19 - just fully immerse and put yourself into
29:21 - that project but you also need a break
29:23 - how can a project really build itself
29:25 - for the long term and I think one way of
29:27 - doing that that Lauren uh speaks to in
29:29 - this article is a rotating model of
29:31 - leadership so um there's more to it than
29:34 - that and there's lots of information
29:35 - about the history and people to thank in
29:37 - within this article that I would um
29:38 - highly recommend that you read through I
29:40 - would um take a look at our community
29:42 - statement um but uh so I think what our
29:45 - goal and I think I can find it somewhere
29:47 - here is to
29:50 - um I'm just going to talk about it I'm
29:52 - not going to scroll through this article
29:53 - for you but um is to have a rotating
29:55 - model of leadership so what if there
29:57 - were somebody who' come on board and
29:59 - paid their work valued and acknowledged
30:02 - through being paid to lead the Project
30:04 - Lead the um open source software the
30:06 - community for a year um and have that
30:09 - person then transition into a mentoring
30:11 - role for a new person to rotate that
30:13 - there's so many benefits to that in
30:14 - terms of bringing in more voices
30:16 - sustaining over the long term but that's
30:18 - going to require more money than uh
30:21 - we've been able to raise or have in the
30:23 - past so please uh
30:28 - I'm a little out of focus I for thank
30:29 - you mat for not I forgot to focus the
30:31 - camera so that you should always tell me
30:33 - that I'm going to fix that and then I
30:34 - also just remembered I don't think I'm
30:36 - recording to dis so I just
30:39 - now I just now I completely I've
30:42 - forgotten all of my usual thing I'm so
30:44 - so enthused about this fundraising that
30:46 - I didn't even focus the camera although
30:48 - to be honest I look a little better with
30:50 - a soft focus don't you
30:54 - think um hold on Multi quarter go
30:57 - okay I am recording everything to disk
31:00 - now minimize that um hi from Brooklyn
31:04 - says saber Sabra is in the chat hi to
31:07 - Ala um and let me fix this C let me fix
31:11 - uh the camera so um I'm going to use
31:18 - my uh focusing device which is this you
31:23 - know one of these days I'll uh actually
31:24 - do these live streams with another
31:26 - person in this room but I'm put this
31:27 - here that's a good spot to focus on I
31:30 - think we might be ready for our Jingle
31:32 - Bells to thank our donors I'm gonna
31:35 - Focus there so much better there we go I
31:39 - focus the
31:42 - camera
31:45 - and here we are by the way I am going to
31:47 - do some coating today I don't know how
31:51 - much uh where are we how come I can't
31:54 - see like a running tally so let me go
31:57 - over let's at least go here and let's
31:59 - see if there's anybody to uh thank so
32:02 - I'm going to I think if I just go down
32:04 - oh I want to talk about these gifts okay
32:06 - ah so first let me thank uh oh look at
32:09 - this Gregor so an Vincent um I I'm just
32:13 - gonna thank everybody that's on here
32:14 - right now it's not so many that I can't
32:16 - Jesse Louie Rosenberg dimma Derek Barrel
32:19 - suun Douglas Alvaro Philipe eron hi eron
32:22 - Elliot Anonymous uh Anthony Thomas uh
32:27 - I wish that I was capable of reading
32:30 - this but thank you Jean G Nicholas
32:33 - Andrew Michelle Clayton Z deac Gabriel
32:37 - jels olich Neils Vincent and Gregor now
32:40 - look at this this is a wonderful a very
32:41 - generous donation uh donated Revenue by
32:44 - the WIP GitHub app this is not something
32:47 - I'm familiar with but I'm definitely
32:48 - going to take a look um H at that um
32:53 - that's a wonderful thing that you can do
32:55 - uh one thing that you can do if you are
32:56 - not a able to donate yourself but maybe
32:58 - you're affiliated with an institution
33:00 - perhaps you're a student somewhere are
33:02 - you a student somewhere and your school
33:04 - is teaching with processing or P5 did
33:06 - you know that your school could make a
33:08 - donation your school probably has like a
33:11 - really big budget for software licenses
33:14 - and they spend it on lots of stuff which
33:15 - they need and they should spend it on
33:17 - that but they should also give some of
33:18 - that to the processing Foundation um and
33:21 - one way actually that they can do that
33:22 - is and be in touch with the processing
33:24 - foundation on social media or just to me
33:26 - Direct I think there's people in the
33:28 - chat who can help you right now we have
33:29 - an invoice generator so if your school
33:31 - or institution needs an invoice as if
33:33 - they're paying for something we can
33:35 - create that ultimately it's it's a
33:36 - donation but we can create an invoice
33:38 - for you if you need that um paperwork so
33:40 - and then thank you to Ste uh Muller
33:42 - Hansen uh who uh we is the how's the
33:45 - focus now is it better um who uh been
33:47 - talking about something to do with uh
33:49 - graphic design and the coding train that
33:50 - might be coming in the future um thank
33:52 - you for this donation I'm gonna hit
33:53 - refresh come on people um
34:03 - I want to see new donations here I want
34:06 - to see some new donations here people
34:09 - the phones are ringing they're not
34:13 - [Music]
34:15 - ringing don't make me oh wait no no no
34:18 - no there is a new donation Brett Cooper
34:22 - thank you to Brett Cooper M thank you
34:24 - for your donation that deserves
34:27 - are coding train Jingle Bells what's the
34:30 - chance that there's like a poll request
34:33 - or an issue with the co
34:35 - cords no no all that time people were
34:38 - posting it all in the chat over and over
34:40 - again but nobody put it here for me to
34:42 - see come on people uh help me out here
34:48 - like gotta be C and G you know basic
34:50 - stuff right all right I'm going to make
34:52 - this
34:55 - happen
35:02 - cing train coding all the
35:06 - waying all the waying train cing train
35:12 - cing all the way way way oh it's just
35:15 - all
35:20 - [Music]
35:24 - C something like that right
35:29 - cing train cing train this coding
35:34 - train when I code I use node and
35:39 - JavaScript every
35:41 - day coding train coding train this do
35:46 - coding
35:48 - train when I code I use node and
35:52 - JavaScript
35:54 - every day
35:57 - [Music]
36:04 - oh no Danos solvin $50 for the proing
36:08 - foundation thank
36:09 - you thank you to Danos solvin he's kind
36:12 - of in charge of me I might be getting in
36:15 - trouble for what I'm doing right now I
36:16 - don't think so it's very hard to get in
36:18 - trouble with that Thanos Sullivan I've
36:19 - really tried I try I try if only I could
36:22 - just get fired from this ITP job I could
36:24 - spend so much time making these videos
36:28 - all right thank you that deserves
36:29 - perhaps another holiday tune but I think
36:32 - maybe I'm too embarrassed to move on
36:34 - let's start thinking about some code
36:36 - stuff that we could
36:38 - do that was by the way without really
36:40 - knowing what the chords were I'm sure I
36:42 - got it wrong but uh I appreciate your
36:44 - efforts
36:46 - everybody all right uh let's see where
36:50 - we how do I get this running total um I
36:52 - there must be a way for me to do that uh
36:54 - okay ah 340 I do actually see does it
36:56 - refresh automatically it's just higher
36:58 - up on my screen over here I'm over here
37:00 - people by the way so by the way the
37:03 - theme as it always is first of all let
37:05 - me just mention again Maro um who uh
37:08 - works at Google and who um I met last
37:11 - year doing a a video with uh mpj from
37:14 - fun fun function um Maro spent a whole
37:18 - weekend making this sweater which is
37:20 - just like the most wonderful thing I
37:23 - could ever imagine anybody doing for me
37:26 - um and I love it so much the last time I
37:29 - wore it was last year uh if I could get
37:31 - my act together if it wasn't this whole
37:32 - like semester thing and lots of stuff to
37:34 - do I would spend some more time getting
37:35 - ready for this really all I did was
37:37 - start last night
37:39 - um um but maybe next year I'll I get
37:42 - I'll get a new sweater um but uh thank
37:44 - you for that I have some snowflakes here
37:46 - which has always been the theme so today
37:47 - I think I this is my plan by the way
37:49 - what I'm going to en code and thank you
37:50 - to Violet Graham who um uh who H um uh
37:55 - has been uh helping me with would
37:56 - maintain a lot of the GitHub repos uh
37:58 - Violet had this excellent idea of of
38:01 - generating snowflakes and then training
38:02 - a style Gan model to generate new
38:05 - snowflakes and I'm going to do that with
38:06 - a tool called Runway uh thank you to
38:08 - Ellen Nichols who has been giving me
38:10 - some help and advice about that in the
38:11 - last 24 hours so I'm gon to um that's
38:13 - what's going to happen today it's been a
38:16 - half an hour and I haven't touched the
38:17 - computer really yet so we'll see I mean
38:19 - I could go I I at some point I got to
38:21 - got to be off for the holidays myself
38:23 - this is like my I got to turn in some
38:25 - grades still but other than that I
38:27 - answer some emails today is my last day
38:29 - of work for a little while I'm going to
38:31 - definitely take a break after today oh
38:32 - if let me just quickly mention if you
38:34 - didn't catch the ITP uh show live stream
38:36 - that's also on the channel uh lots of
38:38 - wonderful work by students many of whom
38:41 - are using processing and P5 and these
38:44 - tools um and uh check that out but I'm
38:47 - going to make a nice edited version it's
38:49 - three and a half hours I'm make a nice
38:50 - edited version of that that will come
38:52 - out soon as well all right
38:55 - um
38:57 - okay we've got $344 coming in this is
39:00 - good I want to get to
39:02 - $1,000 I'm not leaving till at that
39:04 - number says
39:06 - $1,000 although that might encourage you
39:08 - not to donate so that I stay here
39:09 - forever I'm gonna leave if that number
39:11 - doesn't keep going up that's what I have
39:13 - to
39:14 - say all right
39:16 - [Music]
39:25 - uh get going on some
39:30 - first still sitting here
39:33 - [Music]
39:41 - for let me briefly mention also um the
39:45 - YouTube fundraiser if you make YouTube
39:47 - videos or if you know somebody who makes
39:49 - YouTube videos that or you know anybody
39:51 - really can but especially if they're in
39:53 - this world of math and science and
39:55 - creative coach an art um who might want
39:58 - to participate in this
39:59 - fundraiser um oh thank you uh gruel
40:02 - house is mentioning starting to work on
40:03 - the holiday songs oh the music is too
40:05 - loud okay sorry about
40:11 - that
40:14 - better I need it to be loud for my own
40:19 - enthusiasm um what was I talking about
40:22 - this is so
40:25 - hard
40:27 - ah yes um this fundraiser can be added
40:29 - to other videos if you would like to
40:31 - make a video about the about processing
40:33 - P5 and have it be a it doesn't have to
40:35 - be a live stream it can be a recorded
40:36 - video I've added it to a bunch of my
40:38 - videos it will just show up next to the
40:40 - video you do need to have access to the
40:43 - of YouTube giving beta um so the way to
40:46 - check that is to go to your creator
40:49 - Studio go under monetization go to the
40:51 - giving Tab and if you have a button
40:53 - there that says join fundraiser then you
40:55 - can join this fundraiser if you have any
40:57 - issue I opened my direct messages on
40:59 - Twitter that's probably like the easiest
41:00 - way to get in touch with me right now
41:02 - but um just be in touch uh um Enrique
41:06 - Nelson says they donated $100 to the
41:10 - wall um I don't know where that came in
41:12 - there's too many places I'll look
41:15 - over uh I'm just gonna believe that that
41:17 - donation came in Thank You Enrique um
41:21 - but if just get in touch if you would
41:22 - like to make a video and have it be part
41:24 - of the processing Foundation um
41:26 - fundraiser okay uh so what else am I ah
41:31 - so
41:39 - yes all
41:55 - right
41:58 - [Music]
42:09 - [Music]
42:17 - ah both XP
42:20 - M thank you for your
42:25 - donation
42:56 - okay so uh the first order of business
42:59 - that I would like to do is just revisit
43:01 - what I made last year which was this
43:03 - Brownian uh motion snowflake pattern so
43:06 - the reason why I pull this up in
43:07 - processing the next thing I'm going to
43:09 - do I'm going to do in p5js on the web
43:10 - because I want people to do it along
43:12 - with me but what I want to see I'm just
43:15 - curious if I um if I can make a variety
43:19 - of these very quickly I want to create a
43:21 - data set so I want to create a data set
43:23 - of maybe a thousand snowflakes and so I
43:26 - believe that I can do this with
43:27 - processing because I'm going to use
43:29 - those thousand snowflakes to cook a
43:32 - style Gan snowflake machine learning
43:34 - model to generate new snowflakes why I
43:37 - don't know because it's what on my mind
43:39 - these days so and I like to use the word
43:41 - cook I like to think of machine training
43:43 - a machine learning model as a process of
43:45 - baking I wish I had like like an oven
43:47 - and some good props here to really like
43:49 - make that happen in a more uh um
43:52 - specific way but we're going to bake
43:54 - we're going to bake well first we're
43:55 - going to to prepare our ingredients
43:57 - we're going to prepare our in this is a
43:59 - cooking show all of a sudden we're going
44:00 - to prepare our ingredients so let me get
44:02 - rid of this full screen so this is if
44:04 - you want to know how this works um I was
44:07 - just on that page um this is the coating
44:10 - challenge page for the snowflake
44:12 - challenge that I did last holiday season
44:14 - you can see I'm wearing this hat what
44:16 - was that that was like a weird sound oh
44:18 - my snowflake fell oh it's so
44:22 - sad this snowflake which I had so nicely
44:25 - t taped up to the wall I'll just like
44:28 - bring it over here with me so sad um how
44:31 - how does this look by the way so um so
44:33 - if you want to learn more about this the
44:34 - people made all these wonderful versions
44:36 - of it here which you can take a look at
44:39 - um um there so what I'm going to do let
44:42 - me do something so to what I uh to
44:45 - create this snowflake so let's think
44:48 - about let's let's use like 512 by 512
44:51 - that's kind of like a standard image
44:53 - resolution that a lot of um
44:57 - that a lot of image-based machine
44:59 - learning models use a machine learning
45:00 - model a neural network-based model has
45:02 - inputs and outputs and those are
45:04 - typically fixed length unless it's a
45:06 - sequential model um and so uh you'll
45:09 - often find it's 28 x 28 or 256 by 256
45:12 - let's go with 512 x 512 so what I want
45:15 - to do is uh rewrite this program to
45:18 - basically automatically run multiple
45:21 - times and every time it runs to save the
45:24 - snowflake so one thing is I I don't need
45:28 - for it to animate so right now it's
45:31 - doing all of
45:32 - this uh how does this work while current
45:36 - is not finished current intersects
45:38 - snowflake current. update count Plus+ if
45:41 - count equals zero snowflake is completed
45:45 - so I think that I could do
45:49 - while count I I'm just trying I don't
45:52 - even remember this code that I did last
45:53 - year by the way you should comment your
45:55 - code people people people of
45:58 - Earth and Beyond because we all know
46:01 - that eventually the aliens will be
46:03 - watching the me and they will think I
46:05 - just watched the movie Galaxy Quest the
46:06 - other day which I love but it would
46:08 - wouldn't it be wonderful if I don't know
46:09 - maybe this is this is a bad idea I'm not
46:11 - representative of
46:13 - Earth but I was just thinking that the
46:15 - aliens of the future will learn to code
46:17 - in processing from me and think and
46:19 - remember think of our culture as being
46:21 - something
46:24 - there all right so uh so I want the
46:28 - whole thing to appear at once so I think
46:30 - I can just instead of having it stop
46:32 - turn off when count is zero I can just
46:35 - do a while loop while count does not
46:38 - equal zero do all of this stuff I hope
46:41 - this
46:42 - works
46:44 - and uh oh but all of this should be oh
46:47 - I'm in Java people one equal sign uh
46:51 - then this actually should be
46:53 - here no no no no no this is the whole
46:56 - snowflake yes okay that should be there
46:58 - it's fine
47:01 - okay this doesn't seem to be
47:04 - working oh no wait count starts a zero
47:08 - oh count plus plus let's have count B
47:13 - one
47:15 - no all right I guess I have to look at
47:17 - the code and figure out what it
47:22 - did all right so what is this
47:24 - doing uh where if count equals zero stop
47:28 - so snowflake
47:30 - add while current is not finished and
47:32 - current intersects snowflake current
47:34 - count plus
47:38 - plus the particle doesn't move at all oh
47:42 - this is an exit condition not
47:43 - implemented in the video oh no I added
47:45 - it after the fact someone's going to
47:47 - help me out here who remembers this
47:49 - better than me current show show all
47:51 - this I
47:53 - six uh this is uh current equals new
47:56 - particle I don't
47:59 - understand where where did my
48:01 - manipulating
48:03 - count oh oh I get it oh I see I see okay
48:09 - I got a better idea let's just do this
48:12 - Boolean snowflake finished is
48:18 - false
48:21 - while snowflake is not finished count
48:25 - equals Zer so this is just checking like
48:27 - is it
48:28 - going and if count is still zero after
48:32 - it's checking all this stuff then you're
48:34 - done so then I'm going to say this not
48:37 - no Loop I'm just going to say snowflake
48:41 - finished
48:43 - equals
48:45 - um
48:47 - false equals
48:52 - true must have spelled this wrong ah and
48:55 - then
48:57 - actually oh and then I could just draw
48:59 - it afterwards like only need to update I
49:02 - don't need to draw it all the time I see
49:05 - so this is the algorithm
49:07 - for because I'm am I erasing the
49:11 - background or no well let's put it in
49:13 - here just in
49:14 - case this should
49:18 - work
49:20 - interesting I got the 6 point count
49:23 - minus minus not count Plus
49:27 - plus I don't think that's what's going
49:29 - on but thank you Simon
49:31 - um so this is just checking to see if
49:34 - there's something not
49:36 - finished oh but there's
49:38 - no oh it finished immediately
49:43 - because um I don't have a first
49:48 - snowflake yeah I need
49:51 - to uh snowflake add current I think I
49:55 - think I need to do
50:08 - that this is not going
50:12 - well all right hold on hold on a second
50:19 - people what's going
50:24 - on
50:35 - okay
50:37 - um here hold on I need to
50:44 - [Music]
50:52 - think let's go back to let's go back to
50:55 - the beginning
50:58 - [Music]
51:05 - King all
51:07 - right
51:17 - so I see so count is counting how long
51:22 - it takes for a particular particle
51:28 - to um for how long it takes for a
51:31 - particular particle to intersect an
51:35 - existing part of the snowflake so we can
51:37 - see so when there's a new particle and
51:40 - it and it doesn't um intersect anymore
51:44 - then
51:46 - um then the snowflake is done
51:51 - so I'm just curious here what if I take
51:57 - um scale one one oh this is what if I
52:01 - take this whole thing I'm just curious
52:03 - to understand this and put it here and
52:07 - just draw it only when the snowflake is
52:11 - completed okay so this is what I'm
52:14 - trying to do I want to just create the
52:16 - snowflake all at once when it's
52:21 - done so this
52:24 - is
52:27 - so this there's no reason why and this
52:29 - should be able
52:32 - to this should be able to go
52:37 - here okay that still works so I should
52:41 - be able to do this over and over
52:44 - again and this is part of drawing
52:53 - it one more try here
52:56 - here all right that's part of drawing
52:58 - all right there's no reason why I
53:00 - couldn't have this happen multiple times
53:04 - right
53:06 - while not
53:09 - finished do
53:11 - this over and over
53:13 - again and if count equals
53:17 - zero
53:19 - finished is
53:22 - true finished is false this should work
53:25 - right right what's my Lo what's wrong
53:26 - with my logic here if the idea is just
53:28 - to like do this a whole bunch of times
53:34 - um uh and
53:37 - this this should still be the same thing
53:40 - and then I don't need this if statement
53:42 - anymore I'm just going to draw it at the
53:43 - end of
53:44 - draw there we go I don't know what I was
53:46 - doing wrong before but this is what I
53:49 - wanted okay this is what I wanted this
53:52 - is what I
53:53 - wanted now what I should be able to do
53:57 - is when I'm done I should be able to
54:00 - clear everything so what are all the
54:02 - things that happen at the beginning so
54:04 - let's make a function called reset
54:10 - snowflake we'll call that
54:14 - here after it draws I'm going to say
54:17 - reset
54:20 - snowflake
54:22 - um oh I don't say function
54:27 - oh I my sound effects are
54:28 - not available to me in the same way this
54:31 - should be void
54:34 - okay now do I still have a no Loop in
54:36 - there okay take out the no Loop take out
54:39 - print line snowflake completed we should
54:41 - see this there we go I am now making
54:43 - many many snowflakes the other thing I
54:45 - want to do is I think I want the whole
54:47 - thing to be rotated by some random angle
54:52 - so I'm actually going to change this to
54:53 - random to
54:56 - high right so this now is generating
54:59 - snowflakes and I should be able to
55:02 - say uh save
55:07 - frame uh
55:11 - snowflakes
55:13 - snowflake and by the way if you don't
55:15 - know about this in processing if you use
55:19 - the save frame function and use these
55:21 - hash symbols the pound symbols um you
55:25 - we'll autonumber the files for you so if
55:27 - I do
55:31 - this we should be
55:34 - getting
55:36 - a whole lot of
55:39 - snowflakes now is there a way that I
55:42 - might want to make these have more
55:45 - variety or is this good
55:52 - enough what do we I can't stop clicking
55:55 - through them um is
55:59 - this what do we think I mean I could
56:02 - give them different
56:03 - colors I like I mean snowflakes they are
56:07 - white if they're actual
56:09 - snowflakes but I suppose I could give
56:12 - them a random color um so what I could
56:16 - do is and where where does everything
56:19 - get that's
56:21 - color it does here Phil stroke so let me
56:25 - say color mode
56:27 - HSB um I I don't remember what the
56:30 - defaults are but I think if I just say
56:32 - 256 it'll make everything within 0 to
56:35 - 255 so then I could say uh I just want a
56:38 - random
56:41 - Hue random Hue is some random number
56:44 - between zero and 255 what this always
56:47 - makes me crazy if I want if I want I
56:51 - guess if if I want an integer between
56:54 - zero and
56:56 - 255 then I would give my random the
56:58 - maximum 256 but this gives me a floating
57:00 - point I think 255 should go in here
57:02 - because I'm not changing it from a float
57:04 - to an INT um and
57:07 - then I just want full brightness and
57:11 - saturation oh wait no no no oh wait
57:13 - what's this GNA do oh this is not what I
57:16 - meant to
57:17 - do I meant to pick a single uh
57:22 - color so let's do this so this is going
57:25 - to be a single
57:30 - color for all the particles and we'll
57:33 - pick
57:37 - it we will pick it uh right here right
57:41 - before we create the Snowflake and
57:49 - then and then we can
57:52 - just put this in
57:57 - everywhere so now I'm also making them
57:59 - different
58:03 - colors all right
58:06 - um so this is good I'm gonna let this
58:08 - run for a little bit there's probably
58:10 - some ways that I can tweak this
58:12 - particular algorithm to get a lot more
58:14 - variety out of what I'm creating
58:17 - but let's just see I would like to get
58:20 - about 2,000 snowflakes so I really
58:22 - should be keeping track of the frame
58:24 - count but one way to do that is just
58:26 - sort of see where we are so while I'm
58:28 - creating these snowflakes oh wow we're
58:30 - already actually we're already quite far
58:32 - along I think it might be time for a
58:35 - song have we had any donations come in
58:38 - let me see if I can look here total
58:40 - raise 396 I'm going to
58:43 - refresh I think it updates
58:45 - automatically um let's go to wow I I
58:49 - really would like to get to $1,000 today
58:50 - people I'm going to match all donations
58:52 - up to $1,000 oh I didn't talk about
58:54 - about the rewards that you can get okay
58:56 - this is a good moment to pause for a
58:57 - second
59:01 - okay but let's stop this stop this
59:04 - craziness here we probably have enough
59:06 - snowflakes now
59:10 - wait did it
59:13 - stop did I stop
59:19 - it hold on hold on
59:22 - everybody let's just start over let's be
59:25 - methodical about this I'm going to say
59:28 - if frame
59:30 - count equals
59:33 - 2,000 uh no
59:40 - Loop
59:42 - okay so now this should give me 2,000
59:45 - snowflakes and Danielle is writing in
59:46 - the chat you can never have enough
59:48 - snowflakes and I could not agree more
59:51 - while we're doing that let me go to to
59:54 - the donor box page so if you just tuned
59:57 - in
60:04 - um if you just tuned in this uh live
60:07 - stream that you're watching is a
60:09 - fundraiser for the processing Foundation
60:11 - support P5 is the hashtag I talked a lot
60:14 - about why we're raising money what the
60:16 - money goes to and why you should give or
60:19 - advocate for your institution to give um
60:22 - to the processing Foundation um but what
60:24 - I fail to mention is that at the
60:27 - different levels um you can you'll get a
60:30 - giveaway a present um and maybe aha
60:33 - maybe you maybe you need a holiday
60:36 - present for a friend or family member a

60:44 - for you to get it but you could you
60:46 - could gift them the the re the you could
60:48 - gift them the future thing that's going
60:51 - to come from your donation you could
60:53 - make a donation in honor of somebody and

60:59 - me from this job instantly the donations
61:01 - are just coming in I I need a only I
61:04 - should have gotten a telephone ringing

61:07 - all right
61:10 - um so uh what so okay so first of all if
61:14 - you want the giveaway please donate

61:25 - easy thing for you to do especially if
61:26 - you just want to make a small donation
61:28 - of five $1 $5 $10 any amount is welcome
61:32 - but uh we don't have a way of tracking
61:34 - of getting your information if you

61:36 - one of the giveaways donate through here
61:38 - let me talk to you about the tiers at
61:40 - the variables level of a donation of $25
61:42 - you will receive a sticker pack maybe
61:45 - there'll even be a coding train sticker
61:47 - in there I don't know there could be
61:48 - there could
61:49 - be but you'll get a P5 and a pro
61:52 - processing sticker and and whatever
61:54 - other stickers are in there at the
61:56 - objects level your donation of $50 will
61:59 - get you a sticker pack and your choice
62:01 - of one of three Riso Prince by the
62:04 - created by the artist Maya man so let's
62:06 - see if I click here let's go to Maya
62:08 - man's website um and this I believe that
62:12 - the Riso prints are based off of this
62:14 - work Maya man is a dancer and creative
62:17 - coder amongst an artist many other
62:19 - things I'm sure if we find Maya on
62:22 - Twitter I believe she was posting like
62:25 - some of the documentation of the Riso
62:28 - prints um so let's see if we look on
62:30 - Twitter here yes so these are what the
62:33 - prints will look like um I don't know
62:37 - too much about Riso printing but
62:39 - apparently it's like a really cool new
62:41 - thing that people are doing there's even
62:42 - a P5 Library called
62:54 - is how they were created so using P5 or
62:57 - processing uh to track her body as
63:00 - dancing and then keep track of it over
63:03 - time and then paint layers of different
63:05 - movements it is just absolutely
63:06 - beautiful wonderful work um and to be
63:09 - honest this is why I want to match
63:11 - everybody's donations up to $1,000 doar
63:13 - I would like to have all these artworks
63:15 - myself um okay so um so that's Maya's
63:20 - work at the um $50 level if you go to

64:29 - manager who has been working on the
64:31 - coding train since the summer who helps
64:33 - out with all sorts of things like um

64:58 - contribute to the processing Foundation
64:59 - fundraiser so this is completely
65:00 - designed and created by Sai um and it
65:03 - has pages about some of the coding
65:05 - challenges with the accompanying source
65:06 - code and I we're going to print these

67:04 - a sticker pack all of the prints uh high
67:07 - resolution videos of mayam man's

67:15 - train Zen it's going to be like paper
67:18 - with some pictures on it but it's
67:20 - special

68:20 - Foundation all right I will say hi and
68:24 - but you know let's let's try to live in
68:26 - a world where we don't try to negotiate
68:28 - and hold people Hostage to their social
68:30 - interactions online let's all just be as

69:12 - thank you oh you're thankful for P5
69:15 - Android Java and JS that you use so
69:16 - often whether as a playful tool or
69:18 - making scientific research it is great
69:20 - software thank you enrio and I will now
69:24 - treat enrio to a
69:28 - song let's see
69:31 - here let's see what's seven minutes ago
69:34 - refactoring all the way since this was
69:37 - done seven minutes
69:40 - ago let's try this one oh we've got the
69:43 - chords
69:48 - okay all right this is this song goes
69:50 - out to enrio and everybody else who's
69:54 - donated to the processing
69:57 - [Music]
69:59 - Foundation dashing through the code
70:02 - dashing through the
70:04 - code in the processing
70:08 - ID through the lines we
70:12 - go factoring all the
70:15 - waybe I'm the wrong
70:17 - key way way
70:21 - way code is way too long
70:24 - long making functions
70:27 - tight what fun it is to make long coat a
70:31 - handful of lines handful of lines
70:35 - tonight
70:37 - oh
70:39 - refactoring
70:41 - refactoring refactoring all the
70:44 - way oh what fun it is to use you it it
70:50 - is to use what's the D chord use four
70:54 - Loops everywhere hey ref factoring ref
70:58 - factoring ref factoring all the
71:02 - way code is oh so short
71:06 - now with iterations and
71:09 - [Music]
71:11 - array that doesn't sound right
71:14 - refactoring refactoring refactoring all
71:18 - the
71:19 - way oh what fun it is to you you
71:25 - four Loops
71:29 - everywhere
71:30 - factoring
71:32 - factoring factoring all the
71:36 - way code is so
71:41 - short
71:42 - now short now
71:46 - with iterations and
71:50 - [Music]
71:52 - array
71:54 - [Music]
72:02 - oh chat you're going off the rails all
72:04 - right
72:07 - um all right thank you to everyone who's
72:09 - donated let's see if that song inspired
72:12 - some new donations we're up to
72:14 - 46 uh dollars on the YouTube fundraiser
72:18 - and we're going to go to donor box again
72:20 - and wherever that page is we're gonna
72:23 - hit
72:25 - refresh
72:29 - Nico another donation from Nico thank
72:32 - you so much appreciate it okay let's go
72:35 - check our data set and I'm going to open
72:37 - up something called Runway and I'm going
72:38 - to train a style Gan model woo this is
72:40 - going to be fun all of you have been
72:42 - waiting for this uh okay so let's check
72:45 - this did this actually end I hope this
72:46 - ended we've got our data set of
72:49 - snowflakes are there 2,000 of them there
72:52 - certainly are
72:54 - um so I'm going to now go to a tool
72:56 - called Runway Runway is not um
72:58 - Affiliated I mean Runway is not uh a
73:01 - project from the processing Foundation
73:02 - it certainly is Affiliated I would say
73:04 - in that it is a uh software tool for the
73:07 - creative arts and in fact let me um
73:10 - there are a lot let me let me go to um
73:13 - the runway GitHub for a second Runway ml
73:17 - uh
73:19 - GitHub um because there is a uh
73:22 - processing
73:24 - Library there is a Runway ml for
73:26 - processing library that created by
73:28 - George um let me find um his information
73:33 - here on GitHub um I think if we go to uh
73:37 - the commit the what where where do you
73:39 - do this on this
73:41 - GitHub um three contributors uh the so
73:46 - orus on uh GitHub is the creator of this
73:50 - Library um Ellen and and Chris
73:52 - Valenzuela are from Runway ml um and so
73:55 - maybe I'll use this Library I'm more
73:57 - likely going to do what I'm going to do
73:58 - in P5 but either way um um there's and
74:03 - there are also if on the runway uh
74:05 - website there
74:08 - are um p5js uh examples to work with
74:13 - Runway so if you want so processing in
74:16 - P5 exist as tools that work with a
74:19 - variety of other things that are things
74:21 - that cost money Runway an example of
74:23 - them you can use a pro I always like
74:25 - making stuff in processing and opening
74:27 - in Photoshop I like to just use Adobe
74:28 - Creative Cloud as the catch all example
74:30 - because it's a thing that people pay for
74:32 - and it's expensive and a lot of people
74:33 - can't afford it and so we don't want
74:36 - that to be the thing for processing but
74:37 - if you can uh you should think about
74:39 - contributing and donating to processing
74:40 - the same way you might pay for something
74:42 - like um Adobe Creative Cloud um and Jack
74:45 - TR7 which is my daughter's roller derby
74:49 - number Junior Gotham girls junior roller
74:51 - derby little shout out plug for them uh
74:56 - uh thank you for your donation of
74:59 - $20 um all right
75:01 - so Runway uh thank you to Ellen and
75:04 - Chris and I'll also mention again this
75:06 - is a fundraiser for the processing
75:07 - foundation so I hesitate to uh mix up
75:12 - too many other things here but I do want
75:14 - to mention that if you want to follow
75:15 - along and try what I'm doing um I have a
75:18 - coupon code for you that will unlock
75:20 - this feature that I'm going to show you
75:21 - is a training uh training a model in
75:23 - Runway which is not available if you
75:25 - just go download Runway itself um but
75:27 - this coupon code let me just find it
75:29 - here in my messages if you'll give me a
75:32 - second on my secondary
75:43 - computer
75:45 - [Music]
75:49 - uh I'm looking for my messages ah here
75:53 - we
75:56 - go ah okay coding trainer all caps
76:01 - coding trainer all in caps um I can type
76:03 - this into the
76:08 - chat this uh will give you some free GPU
76:11 - credits um you know if you want to find
76:14 - out about what Runway is and how it
76:15 - works I've made some video tutorials
76:17 - about it that are on my channel I'm sure
76:18 - if you just search coding train Runway
76:20 - ml you'll find them also Runway has
76:22 - their own so I'm not going to uh spend
76:23 - too much time on that today I will be in
76:25 - January I have a lot of plans to do some

77:05 - Santa Style Gan these are quite
77:07 - disturbing perhaps but you know what are
77:09 - you g to do um but I am now going to go
77:13 - to training and I'm going to create a
77:15 - training experiment and we're going to
77:16 - call
77:18 - this
77:20 - Brownian snowflakes
77:24 - processing Foundation okay we're going
77:26 - to create this all right now you can see
77:29 - all my data sets in here trying weird
77:31 - things with like Thanksgiving turkeys
77:33 - I'm a little bit obsessed with I trained
77:35 - a style Gan on all the number file
77:37 - thumbnails uh okay so I'm gonna do this
77:41 - and then I'm going to go to my where did
77:44 - I have that probably in
77:48 - downloads where's my data my data I
77:52 - should talk about what style again is a
77:54 - little bit which I will do in a second
77:56 - um where is this uh downloads processing
78:00 - okay yeah that's where it
78:03 - is
78:04 - processing snowflakes open this up it's
78:09 - now so it's uploading my data set so
78:12 - let's talk a little bit for a moment
78:14 - about what uh what style Gan is so you
78:19 - can see all my images are there it's 95
78:22 - megabytes 2,000 files so style Gan uh
78:26 - and I'm going to go to the browse models
78:29 - and I'm going to search stylegan and I'm
78:31 - going to go here style Gan is a
78:34 - generative model it's a machine learning
78:35 - model that will generate photorealistic
78:37 - images of faces Landscapes and more uh
78:40 - in Runway you can find um the original
78:43 - research paper and the GitHub repo here
78:46 - um there's a little paragraph about it
78:48 - um and um a gallery of things that
78:51 - people have made and the license all
78:53 - that sort of stuff so um I would like to
78:56 - in January come back and do a tutorial
78:58 - about what a gener adversarial network
79:00 - is and how it works the short version of
79:03 - that uh is that it's actually two neural
79:05 - networks one is trying to make so think
79:07 - about the snowflakes if we it's like if
79:09 - you if we had if there were two of us
79:11 - here and I'm trying to draw snowflakes
79:13 - and then then another person here I'll
79:14 - use my hats this is how I'm going to
79:17 - explain this is the generator so a
79:20 - generative adversarial network has a
79:21 - generator and uh discriminator Somebody
79:25 - by the way I'm recording this as green
79:26 - screen footage maybe somebody will like
79:28 - take my explanation here and animate
79:30 - around it which would be ridiculous um
79:33 - so the
79:37 - generator is trying to make snowflakes
79:39 - I'm over here making the snowflakes I'm
79:41 - a neural network that makes stuff making
79:44 - snowflakes and then the discriminator
79:48 - says that does not look like a snowflake
79:51 - to me and that's the that's basically
79:52 - Bally an error and then the generator
79:56 - it's like oh I'm going to take that eror
79:57 - and trying to make you more snowflakes
79:59 - more
80:02 - snowflakes and discriminator at some
80:04 - point the discriminator at some point
80:07 - the discriminator has access to what
80:09 - real snowflakes look like and at some
80:12 - point that discriminator is not going to
80:14 - be able to tell anymore the distinction
80:15 - between a real snowflake and a snowflake
80:17 - generated by the generator and then the
80:21 - model is done that is the is trained so
80:24 - um style Gan has a particular kind of
80:26 - architecture for a generative
80:28 - adversarial Network um you know it's
80:31 - quite well known for uh generating human
80:34 - faces that aren't of real people it's
80:37 - kind of that I think that could be
80:38 - problematic actually and there's a lot
80:40 - of uh I think critical discussion to
80:42 - have around what it means for a model to
80:45 - generate a face of a somebody that looks
80:47 - like it could be a real person on this
80:49 - Earth and who's left out of that
80:50 - equation what data was used and do did
80:53 - people give their consent to their faces
80:54 - being used to train so there's a lot of
80:56 - stuff to discuss about style Gan there
80:58 - but um we can have some fun with it and
81:02 - instead of using it to train um what you
81:05 - might typically see faces Landscapes we
81:08 - can actually
81:10 - generate abstract patterns from
81:13 - processing make a data set and then
81:14 - train the model um and so Runway U you
81:17 - know is really the the one of the first
81:20 - examples of a software application that
81:22 - lets you do this with a user interface
81:23 - traino model so I'm going to click next
81:25 - now here's an interesting thing I need a
81:27 - starting I need a starting model so um
81:31 - this is this is like transfer learning
81:33 - in the sense that we're taking a
81:35 - pre-trained style Gan model that knows
81:37 - how to generate something like faces or
81:40 - portraits or bedrooms and then it's
81:42 - going to that's going to be the
81:43 - snowflakes and it's going to keep making
81:44 - adjustments till it looks more like
81:45 - snowflakes I think these flowers would
81:47 - probably work well as a base model
81:49 - that's just a guess um let's train let's
81:52 - just train for about an hour this is the
81:54 - baking we're going to bake this model I
81:56 - have a don't worry I have another oven
81:58 - with one pre-made actually I didn't do
81:59 - the snowflakes so we're going to bake
82:01 - this model uh we're going to let it go
82:03 - 1500 training steps and by the way don't
82:05 - don't be misled this if you're using
82:07 - Runway this does cost money although uh
82:10 - you you know if you want to train one
82:11 - model you can do that for free uh start
82:14 - training so I'm going to start training
82:17 - the experiment is starting and it can
82:18 - take a few minutes um I'm going to just
82:21 - uh the the nice thing is here I can
82:23 - close or use this app normally I'm just
82:24 - going to minimize Runway maybe I'll quit
82:26 - it I think I'll just quit it we'll come
82:29 - back to it okay and we're gonna see
82:32 - maybe we'll do another
82:34 - song um and see uh see if we can get
82:39 - some more
82:40 - donations all
82:46 - right what am I looking for here all
82:49 - right so we've
82:51 - got
82:54 - we're up to $432 on YouTube which is
82:56 - pretty awesome thank you
82:59 - everybody um I think it's just and now
83:03 - we are Nico was our last donation here
83:05 - on donorbox I don't think I missed any
83:07 - coming in on YouTube please let me know
83:09 - if I
83:16 - did if there's another
83:18 - donation I'll be singing another
83:21 - song
83:34 - oh whoa Patrick stepan and Ma Blanchette
83:39 - Mata if you don't all know you should be
83:42 - thanking Mata for all the videos that
83:44 - you've watched in the last I don't know
83:46 - how many years now it's crazy Mata does
83:48 - all the editing for the coding train and
83:51 - you might have noticed that it's really
83:52 - upped upped his game and we have a lot
83:54 - more stuff that's happening now with new
83:56 - technology and better editing techniques
83:58 - and so even though these live streams
84:00 - are just live streams a lot of times
84:01 - we'll take what happened to live stream
84:03 - and repackage it and make it more clear
84:04 - and fix errors and that kind of stuff so
84:07 - um thank you matio for your donation and
84:09 - thank you to
84:11 - Patrick step on this song goes out to
84:16 - Patrick and
84:18 - ma uh what song will I do now now that
84:22 - it's 11:20 I was going to just do this
84:24 - till
84:25 - noon we might go a little past that I'm
84:27 - getting a little I need a break um all
84:29 - right let's
84:31 - see what's been recently
84:35 - updated 17 minutes ago 17 hours 31
84:38 - minutes coding train Jingle Bells this
84:42 - dot this came in I think this was um
84:46 - this was also from I
84:51 - believe uh
84:55 - um All I Want For All I Want For code to
85:00 - run I don't need a lot for coding this
85:03 - this is another is this the same
85:07 - song um I don't
85:10 - know um but I'm going to go do the
85:15 - one that has the
85:21 - chords
85:28 - maybe it's better for me to just
85:31 - uh oops have this behind me I don't know
85:35 - it does say starting soon guess I should
85:37 - have one that doesn't say starting
85:47 - soon oh there's some chords here I don't
85:51 - know
85:57 - oh Jingle Bell Rock somebody that's a
85:58 - good song somebody should write me some
86:00 - lyrics for that all I
86:03 - want oh no wait all I want for Christmas
86:06 - is you is a different song no that's the
86:09 - same
86:10 - song I don't want yeah yeah there's also
86:12 - last Christmas that's the Wham
86:16 - [Music]
86:17 - song three years says MAA that's
86:21 - crazy
86:23 - so B7 is
86:25 - this that's a chord I don't know E minor
86:29 - that's one one that I do
86:31 - know E7 do I need to tune I should
86:34 - probably
86:36 - tune okay this one's a hard one Let's uh
86:39 - let's let's have this be
86:42 - tuned if only I could code my own
86:45 - ukulele
86:46 - [Music]
86:51 - tuner
86:56 - I
86:58 - don't I don't
87:00 - want I don't want this dot for
87:04 - Christmas there is just one I don't know
87:07 - what the melody is far I
87:09 - need I don't care about the
87:12 - syntax or the wasted
87:15 - memory oh yeah I did this last year I
87:17 - remember this now I just want my sketch
87:21 - to
87:24 - [Music]
87:26 - play more than you could
87:29 - ever
87:32 - say let's
87:35 - try let's try
87:39 - Java
87:47 - mode all I want for Christmas
87:52 - [Music]
88:01 - is I don't want this dot for Christmas
88:06 - there is just one boo and I need I'm
88:09 - just going to keep on looping until I
88:13 - run out of
88:15 - memory I won't make a link list and send
88:19 - it without the use of websocket
88:24 - I won't even stay awake this is calleda
88:29 - speak singing try debugging with an i
88:33 - [Music]
88:35 - e I just want my I just want my code to
88:41 - sing more than you want machine
88:45 - [Music]
88:47 - learning maybe
88:49 - it'll maybe it'll work with
88:52 - node no that's not right maybe it'll
88:55 - work with
88:56 - node I have the CHS
88:59 - wrong this is really a hard one all I
89:02 - want for
89:04 - Christmas is
89:10 - cold yeah cck
89:15 - pares check the right Melody on YouTube
89:18 - it will be
89:19 - fun that song went out to
89:24 - uh all the people who just
89:31 - donated this is what I was looking at by
89:33 - the
89:34 - way look for it without lyrics version
89:37 - and play guitar to
89:39 - it okay people are giving me some good
89:41 - suggestions well I
89:43 - tried I think I should do this Jingle
89:46 - Bell Rock I think this would be a good
89:48 - one for me anybody have any lyrics for
89:50 - Jingle Bell Rock
89:53 - maybe I can make some up factoring
89:56 - refactoring refactoring
89:59 - Rock I'm going to make them up on the on
90:01 - the
90:05 - spot factoring Rock and ref factoring
90:09 - Rock factoring ref factoring we
90:12 - factoring factoring now the debugging
90:16 - has
90:17 - [Music]
90:20 - begun debugging debugging debugging Rock
90:25 - debugging and the debugging time
90:28 - factoring and debugging refactoring
90:31 - debugging in the coding
90:34 - train what a bright time it's the right
90:39 - time to refactor the code
90:44 - away debugging time is a swell
90:50 - time to go fixing up
90:54 - the no pointer exception gy up gy up or
90:59 - factor comment your code comment it all
91:02 - the
91:04 - time
91:05 - time mix and mingle and refactor your
91:10 - code that's the
91:12 - refactoring Wait
91:16 - no that's the
91:18 - refactoring
91:20 - Rock
91:24 - that's the debugging that's the debuging
91:27 - that's the
91:31 - debuging thank you made up on the spot I
91:36 - want to transcribe that and make some
91:37 - better lyrics I'll do it again feel like
91:40 - that's like a good one I know all those
91:43 - chords also Last Christmas by Wham that
91:46 - that would be a good one to do the 12
91:48 - days of coding
91:49 - yeah I should definitely do the I think
91:51 - think that'll come we we'll do that at
91:53 - the end that'll be the grand salami as I
91:56 - like to say Grand
91:58 - Finale okay also I brought my 5x5
92:01 - Rubik's Cube which I could attempt to
92:02 - solve that could be something to do let
92:06 - take a break okay it's getting warm in
92:08 - here 77 degrees I've I've I'm on my uh
92:12 - holiday break and I've gone to Florida
92:14 - with my my sweater apparently because
92:16 - it's so hot in here please fix the air
92:19 - someday someday I'm going to have a
92:20 - place where I can live stream where the
92:21 - air is
92:24 - cool oh let's check on our uh baking our
92:34 - model I'm going to check how our model
92:37 - is
92:38 - doing all right so our model has gone
92:42 - 100 steps it started as
92:44 - flowers we can see this is what it
92:46 - generated this is a random assortment of
92:48 - flowers that the style Gan model
92:50 - generated
92:59 - and we can see uh what it's at now do
93:03 - you see the snowflakes coming in it's
93:05 - starting to change right this was a
93:07 - beginning and now up to here so we we're
93:09 - going to definitely need a lot more
93:11 - steps it's just 110 steps this is going
93:13 - to take quite a while 41 minutes
93:16 - remaining well going to have to be here
93:18 - for at least 41 more minutes all right
93:23 - I am now going to do a coating challenge
93:26 - thank you to Violet for this idea I
93:28 - always like to do something with
93:29 - snowflakes and I thought that would be
93:31 - impossible because I had done too many
93:33 - snowflake
93:37 - things oh I should let's take a look at
93:39 - what's so this is my idea was holiday
93:41 - style again that's what we're doing
93:43 - coding challenge tellan idea
93:44 - optimization of Santa's gift wrapping
93:47 - Department that's fascinating oh that
93:50 - was from last year so these are are all
93:51 - the ones that have been suggested
93:52 - recently although some more might have
93:54 - come in that weren't tagged holiday
93:55 - Telethon because you if you're
93:57 - submitting you can't tag it yourself um
94:01 - so I guess I could just go back and take
94:03 - off the
94:05 - label but there aren't any anyway um so
94:09 - falling snowflake with realistic physics
94:11 - this uh comes
94:13 - from uh Chris orbon of the stem coding
94:16 - YouTube channel that you should
94:17 - definitely check out um and um
94:22 - here's a code with a falling snowflake
94:24 - that has re realistic
94:27 - physics Let's Take a Look So This what I
94:30 - love about the stem coding YouTube
94:31 - channel is and I I I don't it's very
94:35 - similar to what I do in that and with
94:37 - the nature of code book and materials
94:39 - where I will take ideas from physics and
94:42 - apply them to animations and code
94:44 - examples but I don't do them with a lot
94:46 - of rigor I just kind of you know Tinker
94:49 - and kind of use in inspired by the ideas
94:52 - and kind of try to create the illusion
94:54 - of something happening in physics but
94:56 - stem coding as a science-based channel
94:59 - it's you know primary purpose in I don't
95:01 - maybe not primary purpose but a main
95:02 - purpose is to teach the science through
95:04 - the lens of coding and simulation so the
95:08 - terminology and the accuracy is much
95:11 - more true to the science itself and you
95:13 - can see here this idea of a snowflake
95:15 - falling with a certain amount of forces
95:17 - and visualizing all the vectors I do
95:19 - believe falling snowflakes uh coating
95:23 - challenge that I do have uh snowfall
95:27 - that I did make this coating Challenge
95:29 - on another holiday I used to use a
95:31 - keyboard which I'm actually quite a bit
95:33 - better at playing the piano than ukulele
95:35 - so maybe I should do that we we can look
95:36 - at the live demo of this to see what it
95:38 - looks like um so this is what I made a
95:40 - bunch of years ago you can see I think
95:41 - this is just using pearlin noise for the
95:43 - motion of the snowflakes not realistic
95:46 - physics I'm not a physics engine like uh
95:48 - can kananelo in the chat is suggesting
95:50 - matter. JS another open source library
95:53 - that you might want to
95:54 - support um but I did make this uh
95:57 - project so um you could go back and
95:59 - check through that Violet is in the chat
96:02 - now hello Violet um thank you for
96:05 - helping with maintaining the
96:07 - repositories um okay but I am going to
96:10 - go to Violet's
96:15 - suggestion and look at this snowflake
96:18 - Kaleidoscope
96:19 - sketch so
96:22 - I have explored a lot of different ways
96:23 - to create snowflakes you saw the brownie
96:25 - in motion example I used uh something
96:27 - called sketch RNN which is also a
96:29 - machine learning model trained off of
96:30 - drawings the Google Quick Draw data set
96:32 - to generate
96:33 - snowflakes um I think there's probably
96:36 - some other ones that I'm forgetting um
96:38 - but another one another way to create a
96:41 - snowflake is to let uh a a user draw and
96:46 - just tile that pattern now this is more
96:49 - than six-fold symmetry I believe the uh
96:52 - a snowflake should have it six-fold
96:55 - symmetry this isn't this is just a
96:56 - kaleidoscope painter so this isn't
96:58 - trying to be a snowflake so I think I
96:59 - could make a version of something like
97:01 - this that allows the the viewer the user
97:04 - the person the human being operating the
97:07 - computer trying to avoid using this word
97:09 - user um to uh draw a
97:13 - snowflake so maybe we'll try to make
97:15 - something like this now I always
97:16 - hesitate to make things that are
97:18 - Recreations of somebody else's work so
97:20 - one thing I'll just do here since this
97:22 - is being inspired by um um somebody who
97:25 - runs a website called perot.com
97:29 - let's just go to the main
97:33 - URL um I encourage it looks like the
97:35 - collidoscope painter and lots of other
97:38 - uh kinds of activities and apps and
97:40 - tutorials so there's even tutorials and
97:42 - things around o rayc casting Source
97:44 - coded demos check all this stuff out
97:46 - lots of stuff there and you can support
97:49 - I mean I know this is a processing
97:50 - Foundation fundraiser so so I hesitate
97:51 - to mention other things but since I'm
97:52 - going to base my idea off of what's come
97:55 - here I think it's important to mention
97:57 - that they do have a link down here uh
97:59 - support me on Kofi so someone will
98:01 - remind me in the slack channel to after
98:03 - this is over for me to make sure and I
98:04 - go uh donate there because I'm GNA uh be
98:08 - using it as part of my uh
98:11 - inspiration all right so I want to do
98:13 - this with P5 I'm going to use the P5 web
98:16 - editor and if you want to see me in the
98:19 - next year continue to do c videos and
98:22 - coding tutorials I mean it's a lot of
98:24 - you support me and I um I'm very lucky
98:26 - to have this uh audience on YouTube and
98:29 - um it's it's um allowed me to do a lot
98:30 - of things and um I'm really grateful but
98:33 - it would not be possible without the
98:34 - work of the processing Foundation uh the
98:36 - p5js library the processing project so
98:39 - uh you know it's not just gonna I'm not
98:41 - just going to keep doing this if these
98:43 - projects don't exist so uh that's why
98:46 - you should uh donate um okay
98:52 - so I'm going to try to make a
98:54 - kaleidoscope snowflake in
98:58 - P5 by
99:00 - drawing and that you know so I wasn't
99:03 - thinking that I would have anything
99:04 - edited come out of this live stream but
99:06 - because I can have an edited video also
99:09 - like re-up the fundraiser um I think
99:12 - maybe I'm going to now do the weird
99:13 - thing where I act as if I'm in a brand
99:15 - new video because we'll sort of edit
99:17 - this later
99:19 - so um so yes but first I really want to
99:22 - solve my 5x five Rubik Cube because I
99:24 - learned how to do it takes me quite a
99:26 - while
99:28 - though um just check in
99:31 - $432 people I want to see some I want to
99:33 - see that number up I want to see it but
99:35 - up to 500 at least by the time oh neon
99:37 - animus donated
99:41 - $20 um Zachary MacArthur is asking how
99:44 - are the processing foundation and p5js
99:46 - connected thank you for asking that um
99:49 - so the p5js project is is maintained by
99:52 - the pro the processing Foundation is the
99:53 - legal entity that maintains the open
99:56 - source p5js project processing
99:58 - Foundation does a lot of other things
99:59 - too other projects processing python
100:02 - processing processing for the Raspberry
100:04 - Pi processing for Android a bunch of
100:06 - software projects as well as many
100:08 - educational initiatives fellowship
100:10 - program events processing Community
100:13 - which is something I should mention but
100:15 - um but uh the so what we would like to
100:19 - do as part of what we're fundraising for
100:21 - for is hire someone to be the open-
100:23 - source maintainer the lead maintainer of
100:25 - P5 for
100:27 - 2020 I like to say processing 2020 vote
100:30 - for processing in
100:33 - 2020 um and so it's it's not a given
100:37 - that P5 is going to is is going to
100:39 - continue being developed uh we need uh
100:41 - we need funds to be able to pay people
100:43 - to continue that work okay um Francesco
100:47 - is asking what is the processing
100:48 - foundation so let me point you to uh
100:51 - processing foundation.org this is URL
100:53 - where you can read more um you know
100:55 - since people are just joining I will
100:57 - just reup some of these links uh would
100:59 - if you want to know about why we're
101:01 - raising money for the future of P5
101:03 - amongst many other things um this
101:05 - article by Lauren McCarthy making space
101:07 - for the future of p5js is a must
101:10 - read okay let me close a lot of these
101:15 - URLs and
101:16 - links oops just to kind of clean stuff
101:20 - up
101:23 - here and okay so I'm going to
101:28 - do
101:29 - [Music]
101:30 - Kaleidoscope
101:33 - snowflake
101:35 - okay
101:37 - $452 thank you neon an anims for your
101:40 - donation train whistle for
101:45 - you I'm actually just going to take a
101:47 - short break to get some water since I
101:49 - think I'm going to go past noon I think
101:51 - now would be actually before I do this
101:52 - coding example um let me take a short
101:55 - break and hope that um some donations
101:59 - come
102:00 - in oh well let me answer this other last
102:03 - question can I work for processing for
102:05 - free so you know work for I think we
102:09 - could we could have a bunch of different
102:10 - discussions about what that means but
102:12 - let me rephrase that question can I
102:14 - volunteer for the procing foundation
102:16 - absolutely it's very it's complicated
102:18 - with these kinds of projects because
102:20 - there is a volunteer Spirit to them and
102:21 - there is a lot of people who contribute
102:24 - um through uh through online uh tools
102:26 - like a GitHub through the processing
102:28 - Forum by answering people's questions by
102:30 - teaching workshops in their communities
102:32 - those are all contributions to the
102:34 - processing Foundation a lot of people do
102:35 - that work volunteer that work and and
102:38 - don't get a lot of credit for it so
102:40 - number one is we we would like to do
102:42 - from the processing Foundation I think I
102:43 - can say that we would like to make sure
102:45 - people are getting credit for those
102:46 - kinds of contributions so please reach
102:47 - out if you are doing things in your
102:50 - community with processing and p5js and
102:52 - other related tools um Foundation
102:55 - processing.org is the email you can
102:56 - write to and processing org on Twitter
102:58 - and various other social media platforms
103:01 - um Marcus Whitley 20 pounds UK
103:06 - [Music]
103:07 - pounds um thank you for your
103:10 - donation and so of course the idea of
103:13 - raising money to hire people to work on
103:16 - processing MP5 is not to the exclusion
103:18 - of people who have the ability and
103:20 - privilege to donate and volunteer their
103:22 - time and that it's all part of the
103:24 - ecosystem of an open source project like
103:26 - processing and p5js
103:29 - but somebody needs to be for a pro for a
103:32 - project the scale of P5 to continue uh
103:36 - there needs to be somebody in a
103:37 - leadership position who has given the
103:38 - time and space and funding to be able to
103:41 - make decisions and help manage um and
103:44 - answer questions to all the people who
103:45 - are volunteering and contributing in
103:47 - other ways and that's what we're really
103:48 - raising money for um in addition to
103:51 - smaller uh projects that are funded
103:53 - through like the fellowships and by the
103:54 - way I I think the deadline passed oh the
103:56 - deadline's today uh to apply for the
103:59 - processing uh the fellowship
104:03 - right open call for 2020 oh no the
104:06 - deadline was
104:08 - [Music]
104:09 - yesterday you know maybe you can ask if
104:12 - we'll accept a late application but this
104:14 - this also is funded through we we've
104:16 - been lucky enough to have grants for
104:18 - programs like the fellowship um Google
104:20 - summer of code uh is a program that
104:22 - supports processing and P5 development
104:24 - quite a bit but that needs even Google
104:27 - summer of code where students are paid a
104:28 - quite a good stipend I think to work on
104:31 - an open source contribution over the
104:32 - summer and mentors are paid a stipend
104:34 - all funded through Google it still needs
104:36 - the administration of the processing
104:37 - Foundation somebody who's the lead
104:38 - maintainer of the project to really uh
104:41 - to help um you know set people up for
104:44 - Success so people can volunteer for an
104:47 - open source project but if nobody's
104:48 - there to hear their volunteering and to
104:51 - answer their questions and to Mentor
104:52 - them the things things can go and and
104:55 - I've and we've made this mistake and
104:57 - I've made this mistake personally to not
104:59 - be there for somebody who is uh wants to
105:02 - contribute and for have them for them
105:03 - not to feel good about it and so that's
105:05 - really what um we need to um allocate
105:08 - time resources and funding to okay I'm
105:11 - going to take a short
105:13 - break um and just to get some water and
105:16 - then I'm going to do this uh coding
105:19 - example
106:19 - for
106:27 - [Music]
107:22 - [Music]
107:49 - for
107:57 - [Music]
108:53 - [Music]
110:03 - [Music]
110:25 - [Music]
110:48 - [Music]
110:56 - [Music]
111:03 - [Music]
111:18 - e
111:21 - [Music]
111:47 - [Music]
112:21 - [Music]
112:48 - all right sorry everybody I had a little
112:49 - a little bit of technical difficulties
112:51 - there I had to refocus the
112:53 - camera U but I'm back thank you for
112:58 - break we're are now I know I eventually
113:00 - I'll get another one that says like
113:02 - intermission or back soon but we're now
113:06 - ready for part two time for the my kids
113:10 - were very like you better bring those
113:12 - hats home don't leave those at work they
113:15 - want to wear these all weekend these are
113:17 - my kids Fanta hats
113:20 - okay how we doing donations wise
113:34 - everybody Timothy thank you Timothy
113:37 - thank you for your
113:40 - donation I love processing in tools like
113:43 - P5 J they are so fun to use and create
113:45 - stuff with your donation is very much
113:49 - appreciate oh we've got some more
113:50 - donations coming in a Al 2.0 Brockman
113:54 - who also joined as a member of the
113:55 - coding trade thank you thank you for
113:57 - that uh and thank you for your donation
114:00 - to the uh processing
114:03 - Foundation um okay now let
114:08 - us take a moment to uh check
114:14 - on our style Gan
114:18 - model oo okay you can see we're up to
114:22 - 796 steps there's this thing called FID
114:26 - score which is uh kind of a score the
114:29 - lower it gets I forgot what it stands
114:31 - for FID um fliche Inception distance
114:35 - measures the visual similarity between
114:36 - the generate images from the model and
114:38 - images from the original data set so
114:40 - let's go and move along here and see
114:42 - what are we getting to O there's
114:44 - starting to look more like
114:46 - snowflakes yeah there we go so we're at
114:49 - 810 steps and look what our style can
114:52 - model has generated fascinating okay
114:55 - we've got something that's like closer
114:57 - to snowflakes we're going to get all the
114:59 - way to 1500 steps maybe we'll let it go
115:01 - even further we shall
115:03 - see um okay I wonder if a larger
115:07 - training because the one thing about how
115:08 - generating the data data set generating
115:10 - the training images from processing it
115:12 - would have been just as easy me for for
115:14 - me to generate 10,000 as it was 2,000 at
115:17 - a certain point I'd run out of hard
115:18 - drive space or it would take long to run
115:20 - or but I wonder how much that um plays a
115:23 - role here um
115:25 - okay I wonder also it what you know if I
115:28 - had left them all one color I wonder if
115:30 - that would have uh kind of helped but
115:32 - we'll see we'll see okay I'm going to
115:34 - minimize
115:35 - this um I never know like how much I
115:38 - should go with the singing versus the
115:40 - coding I mean I should really generally
115:42 - go with the coding but today is the one
115:45 - day out of the year that I will just
115:47 - completely allow myself to well well I
115:49 - guess I do this all the time um now Al
115:52 - 2.0 Brockman donated more
115:56 - 20 thank you very
115:59 - much um so I think I should try to make
116:02 - this coding example
116:03 - now um right yes
116:09 - okay yes
116:11 - right I will just
116:15 - mention that if you would like
116:20 - to submit
116:22 - lyrics to any of these songs feliss
116:25 - Navidad that would be a great easy one
116:28 - to come up with some P5 processing or
116:31 - coding train related lyrics um that
116:34 - would be a good one to
116:36 - do um Silver Bell silent night we did
116:40 - let it snow already last Christmas any
116:42 - of these um uh goodbye I'm going to
116:47 - sleep says Samar uh
116:50 - um any of these I would love some lyrics
116:52 - for I've got the chords thank you to
116:54 - Cynthia Lynn YouTube ukulele teacher
116:56 - we're going to do some more uh music in
116:58 - a little
116:59 - bit all right uh let's go
117:03 - to
117:07 - um
117:10 - uh
117:13 - okay we're going to do the
117:16 - snowflake uh Kaleidoscope effect
117:21 - and uh here we
117:26 - go so I have no issue I have ads on
117:30 - things that I do and I have no
117:32 - problem with there being ads on this
117:34 - site but I sort of feel like I would
117:36 - prefer to well um we'll figure this out
117:39 - later to not have ads show up when I if
117:42 - I produce this as a separate
117:44 - video um especially for the foundation
117:46 - but anyway I'm going to worry about that
117:47 - later all right
118:02 - okay Zachary MacArthur donated $10 thank
118:06 - you Zachary MacArthur for your donation
118:08 - to the processing
118:13 - Foundation all right so I'm going to do
118:15 - the weird thing now where I act like I'm
118:17 - just starting fresh in a new video
118:19 - because this will be my holiday video
118:21 - which will also be a a um um a a
118:25 - fundraiser for the processing
118:27 - foundation so let's
118:29 - actually start
118:35 - with
118:39 - this
118:43 - okay oh let me close this
118:46 - here there we go this looks good maybe
118:50 - I'll make it a little bit oh there we go
118:52 - get more people's faces in and here we
118:56 - go
119:01 - okay hello and welcome to a holiday
119:04 - coding challenge this coding challenge
119:06 - is a fundraiser for support P5 this
119:09 - giving season the processing Foundation
119:11 - is the uh Foundation that maintains the
119:14 - open source software projects processing
119:16 - p5js python mode for processing
119:19 - processing for the Raspberry Pi and
119:20 - processing for Android and if you use
119:22 - any of those tools in your professional
119:24 - life as a student as a teacher um and
119:27 - you have the means that can donate
119:29 - please do there's a link in this video's
119:31 - description for how to donate there's
119:32 - also you can donate directly on YouTube
119:35 - right here over somewhere over there I
119:38 - think is where you can donate on YouTube
119:40 - uh all the information about support P5
119:42 - is on this post there are wonderful
119:45 - artworks that you can get as giveaways
119:47 - from Maya man from uh Kate hollenbach uh
119:52 - from the coding train itself that's me
119:54 - and Sai the coding train Community
119:55 - manager designed as Zen uh SAS frka and
119:59 - more so please donate if you the
120:01 - giveaways are available through this web
120:03 - page and of course we'll gladly accept
120:05 - your donation through the Donate link
120:07 - right here on this page
120:11 - itself all
120:17 - right and
120:21 - thank you to Violet who suggested this
120:23 - idea as the holiday coding challenge
120:25 - this is a kaleidoscope painter that I
120:26 - found online on this website perm.com
120:29 - incidentally this website has a lot of
120:31 - wonderful tutorials and other uh
120:33 - information go check it out but I we
120:35 - were thinking could this be used to
120:37 - create a snowflake could I make
120:38 - something like this where you could
120:40 - paint in P5 and make a snowflake pattern
120:43 - with six-fold symmetry because we all
120:45 - know that snowflakes have six-fold
120:48 - symmetry
120:58 - so this should be hopefully pretty
121:00 - beginner friendly if you're new to
121:01 - coding I'm going to do this right here
121:03 - in the P5 web editor and if you're using
121:05 - the P5 web Eder that's because the
121:08 - processing Foundation maintains the P5
121:10 - web Eder it's a project created by
121:11 - Cassie tasian and your donations are
121:14 - helping to support the web editor the P5
121:16 - library and more uh throughout the uh
121:19 - 2020 as we go into this new year new
121:24 - decade
121:29 - uh all right
121:33 - so so first let's begin by just creating
121:36 - a program where when I click the mouse I
121:39 - draw something and this is actually
121:41 - quite easy to do um because in the draw
121:45 - Loop itself um P5 has set up which will
121:48 - create a canvas
121:50 - you can see it right there that's 400x
121:52 - 400 pixels the draw function Loops over
121:54 - and over again and is always drawing a
121:56 - black background black because of the
121:58 - number zero in the background function
122:00 - so if I say l if I say stroke which sets
122:02 - a stroke color and I say line between
122:05 - Mouse X Mouse y those are the
122:08 - coordinates where your mouse is actually
122:11 - in the
122:12 - sketch and I want to draw a line from
122:14 - there to where I previously was where
122:17 - the mouse previously was so I could use
122:19 - some kind of variable to keep track of
122:20 - the previous Mouse and know the current
122:22 - Mouse and update it but guess what P5
122:25 - has that built in for you and I can say
122:27 - p Mouse X for previous Mouse X and P
122:29 - Mouse y for previous Mouse y so if I run
122:32 - this
122:35 - again no what have I done
122:43 - wrong I'm losing my mind shouldn't I see
122:46 - a line oh I know what I I've like I
122:50 - forgotten everything that I ever learned
122:52 - in the last like 20
122:54 - years I started I really only started
122:57 - coding in like 2001 if I'm I mean I did
122:59 - some before that
123:01 - but it's there everybody look there's
123:05 - the little line do you see it there it
123:07 - is I'm drawing the background over and
123:09 - over again in
123:12 - draw classic so I'm going to move this
123:15 - into setup because I only want to draw
123:17 - the background once so that now the line
123:20 - always appears so there I am drawing so
123:22 - some things I can do I can say if
123:25 - mouse mouse is pressed I only want to
123:28 - draw that line if I am pressing the
123:31 - mouse that's going to allow me to do
123:33 - things like
123:34 - this and then we can start to think
123:36 - about the thickness of the line so I
123:39 - could
123:40 - also um there's a lot of different ways
123:42 - I could I maybe I'll have that be
123:43 - pearing noise or something but I I'm
123:44 - just going to make it a little thicker
123:46 - right now stroke weight uh
123:50 - four whoops oh let me do auto refresh
123:54 - here so that's thicker ah let's do this
123:57 - let's do this let's the speed of how I
123:59 - move the mouse is how thick the line
124:00 - will be so slower will be thicker faster
124:03 - will be thinner I think that makes sense
124:05 - I think that's probably what that
124:06 - collidoscope Pat I show does so I can
124:09 - say what is um I can find the distance
124:13 - between the current Mouse and the
124:16 - previous Mouse that's you know a
124:20 - basically a value that indicates to me
124:22 - the speed how far have I gone on each
124:24 - cycle through draw and then I can say
124:27 - the stroke weight is map the distance
124:30 - which could be anywhere from zero right
124:33 - if I'm not moving at all all the way up
124:36 - to I mean it could let's just give it
124:38 - sort of think about a maximum range of
124:39 - something like 20 and I'm going to
124:41 - invert that uh 20 down I'm always going
124:43 - to have a stroke weight of at least one
124:47 - so um let's see what happens happens
124:49 - there so as I
124:53 - move oh well of course then I'm making
124:57 - all these kind of crazy mistakes then I
124:59 - also need to actually use the stroke
125:00 - weight variable in the stroke weight
125:05 - function so if I move really fast it's
125:09 - really thick oh I kind of want to
125:10 - interpolate that so that it's a little
125:12 - smoother but this will do this will do
125:14 - just fine all right so here's the thing
125:18 - I want the
125:19 - this this was like the easy part right
125:21 - this is the easy part I just want to
125:23 - draw using the mouse now I need to
125:26 - figure out how to get that symmetry
125:28 - maybe we want to use the Whiteboard for
125:30 - this for a second oh no
125:34 - signal let me see if I can get this
125:36 - whiteboard camera back
125:44 - on oh my snowflakes fell I have these
125:47 - nice snowflakes
125:53 - see if I can get this
125:54 - one
125:59 - back whiteboard camera is back my
126:03 - snowflakes are
126:05 - back okay where's a I need a
126:14 - marker what did I just step on nothing
126:17 - we're good we're good everybody
126:23 - okay
126:28 - okay so we have a
126:32 - canvas that's 400 by
126:39 - 400 we can see here this idea of a
126:42 - snowflake with sixfold symmetry one two
126:44 - 3 four five six so the angle that's
126:47 - important here
126:49 - is this particular angle right which is
126:51 - 60 Dees I
126:53 - believe uh and that will give
126:56 - me little
127:01 - little whoa no no no no no no no no no
127:05 - no no no no no 60 yeah 60 60 60 yes 180
127:11 - degrees I just my drawing is
127:14 - terrible
127:17 - okay
127:23 - so let's say for the sake of argument
127:25 - what I'm I'm using the mouse to draw
127:28 - over here so Mouse X Mouse Y is
127:33 - happening over here what I want to do is
127:36 - draw the same thing here and here and
127:39 - here and here kind of rotating along but
127:43 - I also I think I want to flip it each
127:45 - time um in this case I think that's
127:48 - going to create right you can see that
127:50 - these two are kind of like pointing at
127:52 - each other so I think there's also going
127:53 - to be some aspect of like flipping
127:56 - it this is harder you know I think this
127:58 - is exactly what I did with the Brownie
128:00 - and motion snowflake I have the code for
128:01 - that already I'm GNA just be sitting
128:03 - here figuring out again aren't
128:14 - I oh oh no wonder this by the way
128:18 - there's a big mistake here no wonder
128:19 - this was going wonky uh code bulletin
128:22 - pointed this out um and also uh maybe
128:25 - other people in the chat uh pouse why
128:27 - that's why it was kind of doing some
128:29 - weird stuff yeah this is much more like
128:32 - what I
128:33 - expected okay so let's take whatever I
128:38 - draw and also I'm
128:47 - gonna
128:49 - let's try this so just as the simplest
128:52 - way of thinking about it for a second
128:54 - let's go I goes from zero to six
129:00 - right I want to repeat what I'm doing
129:02 - six
129:04 - times I think all this is also going to
129:06 - be easier if I translate to the
129:11 - center so I'm going to need to use
129:13 - translate and
129:15 - rotate
129:17 - um
129:26 - translate and
129:29 - rotate translate takes as its arguments
129:33 - an X and A Y and rotate takes as its
129:36 - argument an angle and what this allows
129:39 - me to do is reposition wherever the
129:42 - origin is so I want the origin to be in
129:44 - the center and I'm going to draw
129:45 - relative to that but then I can also rot
129:48 - rotate what I'm drawing to also
129:51 - duplicate it here rotate to duplicate
129:52 - here rotate to duplicate
129:56 - here and I I kind of glossed over that
129:59 - very quickly but I will refer you to my
130:01 - p5js Transformations video tutorial
130:04 - which goes through translate and rotate
130:05 - in much more
130:11 - detail so I'm also going to now create a
130:14 - variable called MX which is mouse x
130:17 - minus width divided 2 and my
130:25 - Y and PMX and
130:34 - pmy ultimately what I want is to you
130:37 - have I want the mouse position relative
130:39 - to the center so the easiest way for me
130:41 - to do that is just store it in separate
130:47 - variables
130:59 - so I've got the same code here same
131:02 - thing's happening it's just everything's
131:04 - now being drawn relative to the center
131:06 - and I am
131:08 - also drawing it six times but I'm
131:11 - drawing it six times in the same place
131:13 - could
131:17 - I I'm gonna add some Alpha here so we
131:20 - see what's going on could I now say
131:24 - rotate by I times 60° because what I
131:29 - want to do is first draw it here then
131:33 - here then here and I'm I want to rotate
131:34 - one 2 3 four five six
131:42 - times oh and let's set angle mode to
131:46 - degrees because I'm thinking in terms of
131:48 - degrees like 60° which I could think in
131:51 - terms of radians and that would be Pi /
131:59 - 3 there we
132:01 - go now this isn't exactly doing what I
132:04 - would
132:08 - expect it's the right idea interesting
132:12 - getting kind of a little bit of a
132:13 - kaleidoscopic feel to
132:17 - it
132:20 - but I think what I want to do now I'm
132:24 - remembering something from the last time
132:26 - I did
132:28 - this I think what I actually want is
132:32 - to
132:33 - have BCT each one of
132:38 - these and basically take whatever I'm
132:41 - drawing here and uh invert
132:44 - it uh how can I draw this I'm so bad at
132:47 - drawing int invert it there right I I
132:50 - need to actually to create something
132:51 - that feels much more like a snowflake
132:54 - pattern what I'm drawing essentially is
132:56 - like this this element here that's on
132:59 - this side of the snowflake so I need to
133:00 - flip it over draw it here flip it draw
133:02 - it here so I actually want to rotate not
133:05 - six times but 12 times and each time I
133:08 - want to flip what I'm
133:13 - drawing okay so I want to rotate 12
133:17 - times
133:18 - and this by the way should be I should
133:20 - have the angle be okay so I'm going to
133:23 - uh the angle should be 360 divided by
133:28 - 12 and of course I should be
133:30 - using
133:42 - um I mean this is kind of crazy that I'm
133:45 - having these like hardcoded values
133:51 - there so this is what I want this is
133:54 - much more close to what I want but what
133:57 - I want to see now is also I want to
134:00 - invert every other one and Simon is
134:03 - making a good suggestion in the chat to
134:05 - draw a line so I think it actually would
134:07 - be quite useful for me to do that so I'm
134:09 - going to say um I'm also going to do
134:15 - this in setup once I'm going to draw
134:19 - more than just the background just so we
134:21 - sort of
134:31 - see
134:33 - um ah the snowflake
134:43 - fell I want to just draw these lines woo
134:47 - something weird is going on oh something
134:50 - weird is going
134:51 - on I've done something wrong and let's
134:54 - just make them uh red or
135:00 - green um what am I doing
135:09 - here this should be uh
135:16 - 30°
135:31 - oh I've done something ridiculous I've
135:34 - made a pretty serious error I forgot I
135:37 - mean I should know this I should know
135:39 - all of this stuff but even I've done
135:40 - this so many times I just forget it
135:43 - Transformations and the word
135:44 - transformation applies to any
135:46 - translation rotation or scale I'm going
135:48 - to use scale in a minute they're
135:50 - cumulative so if I say
135:53 - rotate by
135:55 - 30° I'm going to do this so rotate I *
135:59 - 30 rotate 30° now rotate well rotate
136:03 - zero then I is 1 rotate 1 time 30 is 30
136:06 - then I is two rotate 2 * 30 is 60 I just
136:10 - want to rotate 30 each time I was
136:12 - thinking about how far from the
136:13 - beginning I want to rotate But
136:15 - ultimately of course I just want to
136:17 - rotate
136:18 - that that
136:21 - amount let's create a
136:24 - variable um we'll call it
136:29 - Symmetry and we're going to have 12-fold
136:31 - symmetry here which is really I really
136:32 - want sixfold symmetry but each each
136:36 - six-fold symmetry segment will be
136:39 - symmetrical so I'm going to say angle
136:42 - equals 360 / symmetry I goes from Zer to
136:47 - Symmetry and and then I'm just going to
136:48 - rotate by the
136:52 - angle there we go that's what I'm
136:54 - looking to
136:55 - do and then the same
137:00 - thing and this I think can just be a
137:03 - global variable for right
137:05 - now that way I can just do the same
137:08 - exact thing
137:11 - here and we see this is what I was
137:13 - looking to see something more like this
137:16 - now this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we
137:21 - should count we should get 12 so let me
137:23 - see if I can do that extra
137:40 - flipping another transformation function
137:43 - that I can use besides translate and
137:45 - rotate is a function called scale
137:49 - now typically we think of scale as
137:51 - scaling something bigger or smaller so
137:53 - for example if I were to use the ellipse
137:55 - function to draw a circle and right
137:57 - before that I were to say scale is two
137:59 - that means double the size or 200% so it
138:03 - would look I'm I'm not going to it's and
138:04 - in this case it's double the radius so I
138:06 - would have something like an ellipse
138:07 - that looks like this but scale first of
138:10 - all you can scale on different axes so I
138:12 - could say 2 comma 1 and if I did that it
138:15 - would just scale the horiz Al axis but
138:19 - not the vertical would still be the same
138:21 - scale so my ellipse would look like this
138:23 - it would be stretched horizontally
138:25 - incidentally I can also apply a negative
138:28 - number to scale if I apply a negative
138:30 - number to scale then it's going to draw
138:33 - it in the opposite direction it's going
138:35 - to invert it which in the case of a
138:37 - circle doesn't matter because it's
138:39 - symmetrical along the axis but if I were
138:41 - drawing something like a triangle then
138:44 - if I had -2 I would see the triangle Le
138:47 - suddenly be drawn like
139:06 - this and um Augustine dor in the chat is
139:10 - saying can't you just do sixfold
139:11 - Symmetry and draw two lines one with
139:13 - original coordinates and one with
139:15 - negated x coordinates yes
139:18 - I think that would
139:20 - work so that maybe I should try it that
139:23 - way I was already thinking about using
139:24 - scale so let me do it my way first and
139:27 - maybe we can revisit that or one of you
139:29 - watching can submit this as your version
139:30 - of it with that uh with that way of
139:32 - doing
139:46 - it
139:52 - sorry I'm thinking and reading the chat
139:54 - at the same
139:55 - time but what I thought would make sense
139:58 - is for me to for any
140:04 - odd I mean it doesn't really matter I
140:06 - don't know if I want odd or even for
140:09 - every other one if I modulus 2 is zero
140:13 - or one not sure which one to invert the
140:15 - scale horizontally so in that say say
140:18 - scale
140:20 - -11 but once again this is happening
140:23 - cumulatively so in this case maybe what
140:26 - I want to do just to like allow
140:29 - myself to be less confused is to add
140:32 - push and pop so that any rotations or
140:35 - translations or scales that happen
140:37 - within
140:39 - each and not outside the loop right
140:42 - inside the loop for each section are
140:45 - handled are um
140:48 - are
140:51 - contained and so in this case I would
140:53 - want to go back to rotating I times the
140:56 - angle so now they're not cumulative
140:58 - because I'm saving the transformation
141:00 - state in its original way scaling by
141:03 - inverting it
141:05 - drawing uh sorry rotating do I want to
141:09 - scale before rotate rotate SC I think
141:12 - I'm want to rotate and then flip it
141:14 - we're going to find
141:16 - out
141:19 - okay so this is kind of the what I was
141:22 - expecting except I'm not actually seeing
141:25 - where I'm drawing because I think this
141:27 - should be
141:29 - one yeah there we go this is more like
141:32 - what I was expecting
141:36 - there is this a way to draw a
141:40 - snowflake I I definitely have
141:42 - accomplished what I was hoping to
141:46 - do
141:49 - but I'm not seeing too much of a
141:51 - snowflake like pattern I await your
141:54 - feedback and ideas let's check on our
141:56 - style
142:03 - again oh it went all the way no five
142:05 - minutes
142:07 - remaining this is what we got by the way
142:09 - this this is now what the styan model
142:12 - that I train on the other snowflakes are
142:14 - uh
142:16 - showing
142:18 - back to
142:25 - P5 I want to see those uh lines a bit uh
142:36 - thicker just so I understand what's
142:38 - going on more
142:40 - clearly so as I do
142:42 - this right this ah okay so this is
142:46 - sixfold symmetry If I Stay within here
142:50 - so what I should do is
142:52 - constrain where I'm
142:55 - drawing right how would I that would be
142:58 - more snowflake
142:59 - like um I suppose right so it's really
143:02 - but if I draw in here so I really do
143:06 - have it really is
143:09 - 12-fold so how how would I constrain
143:11 - this to be snowflake like try a thinner
143:14 - line yeah so first of all the line is so
143:16 - thick
143:26 - right I mean it
143:28 - is I guess it's more about
143:31 - like being artistic I suppose really
143:35 - it's the onuses on the person
143:38 - drawing this is more snowflake
143:46 - like
143:49 - now what happens if I take
143:51 - out this thing at the beginning to with
143:54 - my guides and I just
144:03 - draw yeah I feel like these are
144:05 - snowflake like one two three but in
144:08 - really getting
144:10 - 12 if I just change this now
144:14 - to six am I did I overthink this
144:17 - Symmetry and actually this is now going
144:19 - to give me sixfold symmetry yeah okay I
144:22 - overthought the Symmetry I
144:26 - guess oh wait wa wait wait this has to
144:29 - be ah
144:38 - symmetry right because
144:45 - now yeah I overthought the symmetry now
144:48 - this is I'm is going to give me
144:56 - sixfold all right I think we've made
144:58 - Kaleidoscope snowflakes all right what
145:01 - else can I all right now I have a weird
145:04 - idea draw with rectangle instead of
145:07 - ellipse that's an interesting
145:13 - idea oh sorry I'm leing the chat thank
145:15 - you Eric Paul Eric pson wrote that they
145:17 - shared this on Facebook and started
145:18 - another fundraiser for processing
145:20 - Foundation um thank you for doing
145:22 - that so now what I think would be
145:24 - interesting actually would be instead of
145:25 - using Mouse X to let's see what happens
145:29 - if I use pein noise just for a second um
145:32 - and I'm using the pein noise
145:33 - implementation in p5js which always
145:36 - comes up whether that's really pein
145:37 - noise or not so let's do um n let's
145:40 - let's do X
145:44 - offset okay I'm just going to um
145:47 - get give myself an XY value um and I'm
145:51 - going to say uh
145:55 - this so I want to make let me make these
145:58 - Global
146:00 - um I'm going to make these Global
146:03 - variables
146:05 - because uh that way because I'm going to
146:07 - have to do the the the previous point
146:10 - I'm going to have to do
146:13 - manually so if MX equals noise of X
146:19 - offset times the width now if you're
146:21 - wondering what pein noise is it's a
146:23 - function that will give you random
146:25 - numbers but the random numbers are
146:27 - sequenced in a way where they're smooth
146:29 - so you get numbers that are near the
146:31 - previous ones there's a lot more to say
146:33 - about that I have a whole playlist about
146:34 - pear noise and open Simplex noise and
146:36 - the different kinds of noise but here
146:38 - I'm just replacing the mouse with uh the
146:43 - noise algorithm in
146:45 - P5
146:48 - so I need X offset which are the inputs
146:50 - to the noise function which are
146:52 - essentially like moving a long time I
146:54 - need to increment those by some
146:57 - amount um and then when I'm done
147:02 - PMX would equal that and pmy would equal
147:06 - that so I'm just taking the previous
147:07 - ones before I get the new ones and
147:12 - now it was already
147:15 - declared sketch line 7even oh is this a
147:19 - built-in variable to like in
147:22 - JavaScript that's so
147:41 - weird no I'm losing my
147:45 - mind
147:49 - why is oh CZ
147:54 - ah because I have MX and MX there should
147:56 - be a y
148:15 - there
148:19 - all right so I don't want if Mouse is
148:21 - pressed
148:32 - anymore
148:37 - interesting oh I need it to be um
148:45 - offset so I'm drawing everything
148:47 - relative to the center there we
148:51 - go so this is not sixfold
148:55 - symmetry it's three-fold
148:58 - symmetry but is this snowflake I have
149:02 - two threefolds rather than six folds so
149:04 - what is wrong first of all I have some
149:06 - error
149:08 - here line was expecting four arguments
149:12 - oh yeah so the first frame so I should
149:16 - just
149:17 - say
149:25 - um I should start with uh PMX equal to
149:29 - MX just so I don't have like an error on
149:31 - the first
149:32 - frame okay so this is kind of the right
149:36 - idea but my symmetry is not
149:45 - right
149:56 - I do like the pattern
150:00 - though who's got ideas for
150:04 - me let's check to see if we have any
150:07 - donations we're at $580 people
150:10 - $580 time for a donation maybe in a song
150:14 - we'll take a break from this
150:26 - spin the thing while it draws that's
150:28 - kind of a fun
150:45 - idea
150:56 - [Music]
151:08 - I want this
151:11 - section to be this drawn duplicated and
151:15 - then I want to see that here here here
151:17 - and
151:27 - here
151:31 - so I kind of have an idea of how to do
151:33 - this and I'm realizing I'm basically
151:37 - recreating what I did with the Brownie
151:39 - and snowflake but just doing it in a
151:41 - different
151:42 - way oops I forgot that I have the music
151:45 - playing
151:46 - [Music]
151:49 - um so let's go back to 12-fold symmetry
151:52 - for a
151:56 - second and what I think that I can
151:59 - do is just limit I have an idea sort of
152:02 - a crazy
152:03 - idea I'm going to limit the
152:07 - Y to
152:11 - be oh no no
152:14 - no the Y value
152:37 - you hold
152:45 - on
152:57 - there this is what I was trying to do so
152:59 - I was going to limit the Y value sorry
153:02 - like because what I want is the Y value
153:06 - to what I'm
153:12 - thinking this is very silly because
153:15 - ultimately I should go back to the
153:16 - drawing thing because it's really about
153:18 - designing it
153:19 - yourself but ultimately what I want to
153:21 - do
153:24 - is if this is what I'm drawing I want to
153:29 - see um I only want to
153:33 - see oh I'm losing my mind here a little
153:41 - bit if this is my little
153:44 - slice I want to see some
153:47 - variation around that's spanning out
153:50 - across the X around this line then I
153:52 - want to see that
153:54 - inverted and then that tiled six times
153:57 - right so that's kind of
154:01 - what I am doing what I thought I was
154:03 - doing
154:05 - now I still have 12 I can't figure this
154:08 - out why can't I figure this
154:15 - out
154:17 - let's go back and look at my Brownie and
154:18 - Motion One what did I do
154:22 - there six times rotate Pi ID 3 which is
154:28 - 60° and then
154:31 - scale oh oh I could just keep flipping
154:33 - it oh I'm flipping it along the Y not
154:36 - the
154:37 - X oh whoa more likely to move away from
154:42 - the center than towards the
154:45 - center
154:49 - this is what I did in the last year I
154:51 - cannot remember what I did last let's
154:52 - just do it the same
155:00 - way so six-fold
155:08 - symmetry don't have push and pop because
155:11 - I want to flip it each
155:14 - time and just rotate by the
155:37 - angle and I only want to
155:44 - draw
156:00 - positive
156:05 - numbers X is going
156:10 - from no
156:14 - negative
156:31 - oh I have the modulus in there ah the
156:34 - modulus has to go out
156:42 - that's symmetry is six the angle is
157:03 - 60° what have I
157:13 - done there's no push pop anymore right
157:40 - you know I really should use polar
157:41 - coordinates if I'm going to do it this
157:44 - way if I'm going to do it this way I
157:46 - should really use polar coordinates I
157:47 - broke it I know I'm confused why
158:03 - though so this is the six-fold Symmetry
158:06 - but the scaling is not
158:10 - inverting
158:14 - because
158:18 - I also want it to be closer to more
158:20 - likely to be closer to
158:22 - zero someone's telling me I times angle
158:25 - but I don't want it as I times angle
158:31 - anymore right because now oh because
158:35 - it's yeah it's
158:37 - going it's rotating back and forth how
158:40 - come I didn't run into this issue in
158:42 - processing because I rotate oh I Ed oh
158:45 - oh
158:47 - oh oh
158:49 - interesting oh I did the thing I drew it
158:52 - twice I drew it twice within each one oh
158:57 - that makes
158:59 - sense basically I see like look at
159:03 - this rotate by the
159:07 - angle
159:10 - push
159:12 - pop
159:14 - and
159:19 - draw the
159:21 - line
159:24 - twice and the second time with it
159:32 - flipped here we
159:35 - go this is what I was looking to do so
159:39 - this is this is now exactly what I was
159:41 - looking to do the difference
159:44 - being
159:46 - um where do I want it to be more likely
159:50 - to draw closer to the center so the way
159:54 - that I could do that would be
160:00 - have go back to draw getting a value
160:04 - relative to the center but then take the
160:06 - absolute value of it because pear and
160:08 - noise will natively cluster around the
160:13 - mean and so this
160:16 - should uh stick much more closely to the
160:19 - center more
160:21 - often there we go here's my perin noish
160:29 - snowflake now what would happen if I go
160:32 - back to letting people draw with the
160:35 - mouse so if I were to do
160:41 - this
160:44 - um
160:47 - I don't think this actually should let's
160:48 - let's try not let's go back
160:52 - to
160:54 - um using the
160:59 - mouse oh yeah let's go back to using the
161:01 - mouse it was so the whole point of this
161:02 - was to draw it I was just curious about
161:04 - pear and noise so I'm going to put if
161:05 - Mouse is
161:06 - pressed we could have the color be pear
161:09 - and noise if Mouse is pressed now I'm
161:14 - drawing
161:16 - now I'm making a
161:19 - snowflake there we go
161:23 - ah
161:26 - finally
161:44 - tada
161:46 - yeah the I think the pear noise
161:47 - algorithm is not really conducive to
161:50 - getting the kind of patterns and I think
161:51 - the mouse works much better so let's
161:57 - um and I think yeah so let's take that
162:02 - off let's get rid of all this just
162:08 - to so I'm going to remove the pear and
162:10 - nois stuff just to finish up this
162:12 - example that was a a bit of a digression
162:42 - okay what we have now now uh Zachary is
162:46 - suggesting yeah like I think this would
162:48 - make a lot more sense to give a lot more
162:50 - space
162:52 - now and
163:01 - um and here we
163:03 - go so what I would like to
163:06 - do is then the next thing I want to do
163:09 - is add a
163:14 - button
163:22 - to save the
163:23 - image and then uh I'm going to
163:27 - say button Mouse pressed and um uh
163:33 - save save
163:35 - Snowflake and I'm gonna write a little
163:37 - function save
163:39 - snowflake that is just going let's make
163:41 - a clear button
163:42 - also so we're going to have a save
163:44 - button and a clear
164:14 - button
164:23 - and with two callbacks save Snowflake
164:26 - and clear canvas so when I want to save
164:29 - I just want to
164:30 - save snowflake. PNG this will take
164:34 - whatever's in the canvas and send it to
164:35 - the downloads directory when I want to
164:37 - clear I just want to draw the
164:39 - background reclear the background at
164:42 - zero so
164:44 - now I feel like there maybe what I
164:46 - should do is uh so people are
164:50 - suggesting I have a pair of unnecessary
164:53 - push and
164:55 - Pop
164:57 - um yeah so you're right that this push
165:00 - and pop is unnecessary so let's take
165:02 - that out it's sort of like having it in
165:04 - there but you're right that it's
165:05 - unnecessary um what I want to do is
165:09 - let's think about color and let's think
165:11 - about line thickness so right now the
165:14 - line thick
165:15 - is determined by the speed of the mouse
165:19 - I guess that kind of makes
165:22 - sense feel like um I should allow
165:28 - myself more
165:36 - thickness but I wonder if it would
165:39 - actually be better to have the line
165:42 - thickness be controlled by a slider
165:46 - um and we'll have color be automated so
165:49 - we're going to do uh we're going to
165:51 - create a
165:55 - slider that has a range between one
165:58 - pixel and 32 and we'll start it at
166:04 - four and we'll give it uh increments of
166:09 - 0.1 and then what I'm going to do is say
166:12 - the stroke weight is not the
166:16 - anymore but is actually the value from
166:18 - the
166:22 - slider so I want to actually uh be able
166:25 - to see this more full screen so I'm
166:27 - going to go to uh
166:29 - share and I'm going to look at this full
166:32 - screen URL and just open that up here so
166:35 - now I should if I'm
166:38 - drawing that's the line thickness if I
166:40 - were to make this larger oh look at this
166:43 - so I need the uh the mouse is pressed to
166:47 - be only if the mouse is within the
166:50 - canvas but that's not not not a huge
166:52 - deal but if I make it
166:54 - thicker right I could do something
166:56 - thicker
166:57 - here and then I could really be much
167:00 - more intricate about my design this is
167:02 - kind of awkward to have to like go down
167:04 - to the slider I don't love this
167:06 - interaction but this is
167:13 - better so um and then color I could have
167:18 - color change the Hue change according to
167:22 - pearlin noise perhaps I kind of like it
167:24 - just being white on black
167:27 - though what is it like 1240 are people
167:29 - still donating I forgot that this is a
167:32 - fundraiser here um what what else could
167:35 - I add here
167:43 - yeah
167:49 - so I'm just going to fix that bug to
167:51 - only do stuff if Mouse X is greater than
167:58 - zero uh less than the
168:04 - width I want to make sure the mouse is
168:07 - in the
168:08 - window so that should fix um that should
168:12 - fix this issue and I'm going to just
168:13 - refresh over here
168:15 - where if I'm operating the slider we
168:18 - don't see any drawing
168:24 - happen Kaleidoscope snowflake
168:28 - maker um scroll wheel oh no I can get
168:34 - the scroll Wheel by going up and down
168:36 - that's a great idea buying the slider to
168:39 - the mouse wheel does P5 have something
168:41 - built in for me to do that I don't know
168:42 - if it
168:43 - does
169:00 - oops so since I
169:03 - had
169:05 - um since I let's use noise for the color
169:09 - so I'm going to have an ex an
169:12 - offset start at zero
169:15 - um I'm going to set the color mode to
169:19 - HSB 255 255
169:23 - 255 and then um what I will do is I
169:36 - will get the Hue
169:40 - value to be the noise function of X off
169:44 - off set times
169:46 - 255 and we'll set Hue uh and we'll have
169:50 - a saturation and brightness all the way
169:55 - up so it's you can see it's always green
169:58 - right now but now if I were to have X
170:01 - offset change over
170:04 - time that Hue is going to change um as
170:08 - it so this is my rainbow
170:12 - multicolored uh
170:16 - uh snowflake so I think this is done I'm
170:19 - going to attempt to design a snowflake
170:20 - now we're going to see like how good is
170:22 - my snowflake design tool and if anybody
170:26 - could manage to paste this link into the
170:29 - chat um what's a quick way that people
170:32 - could ah I guess I could use a Dropbox I
170:35 - don't really actively have a DropBox
170:36 - account oh P5 element Mouse wheel uh
170:39 - Violet was pointing out Mouse wheel all
170:40 - right we're going to do the mouse wheel
170:42 - maybe as the line thickness um
170:46 - uh that's a good thing to try but what I
170:49 - want to try is I want to figure out a
170:51 - way for people to make their snowflakes
170:53 - right like so right now if I design the
170:56 - snowflake a little
170:58 - thicker and in the center and then make
171:02 - it a little like thinner for like over
171:05 - here a lot of green and
171:09 - blue I think the noise algorithm doesn't
171:12 - it sort of like stays around one
171:15 - area um but if I do this and then I hit
171:19 - save now I
171:21 - have my snowflake so I want people to I
171:24 - want a way of collecting all of these
171:26 - into a nice collection of snowflakes how
171:29 - do I do
171:32 - that all right Mouse wheel fine we're
171:34 - going to look up the mouse wheel
171:40 - event how we doing donation wise I got
171:42 - to start soliciting donations we're only
171:43 - at $580
171:45 - Mouse wheel a
171:52 - P5 Mouse wheel event. Delta move the
171:55 - square according to the vertical
171:57 - scroll who that's kind of crazy because
172:00 - the page is
172:05 - scrolling and I just like adjust the
172:07 - this is such a weird
172:10 - effect it's like it's staying in
172:13 - place
172:15 - try using sign instead of noise ah yes
172:19 - this is a nice idea to have a smoothly
172:20 - oscillating let's try that thank you an
172:23 - an for that suggestion I'm Gonna Leave
172:26 - the doing the mouse wheel as
172:34 - somebody for somebody in the audience to
172:37 - try and submit as a A variation and what
172:40 - let's try
172:43 - using
172:45 - uh let's have the Hue
172:48 - uh move with the sign
172:52 - function I could just I could oscillate
172:54 - r g and B on different periods also that
172:57 - could be kind of
172:59 - interesting
173:04 - um I'm going to use the map function I
173:07 - think it wants between Zer and 360 even
173:09 - though I thought I changed the
173:13 - defaults
173:16 - all right let's see how this
173:32 - goes I'm expecting the color to change
173:35 - more oh there we're not oh I see
173:38 - yeah all right we're getting we're
173:41 - getting the full range
173:43 - now
173:45 - I mean do I want I don't know if I want
173:46 - the full
173:48 - range needs to stay grayscale so people
173:52 - are really advocating for
173:54 - grayscale I'm I'm I'm good with
174:00 - that let's try
174:13 - that
174:43 - why
174:53 - s of X off
175:03 - oh just curious here for a second
175:07 - here if we
175:11 - say between negative and one go between
175:13 - 0o and two
175:17 - 55 yeah it's going to go up to
175:21 - White and oscillate back
175:24 - down it's getting brighter over
175:28 - time it should go back it's just going
175:30 - really slow oh because I'm in angle mode
175:33 - degrees I'm wondering why this number I
175:36 - mean I'm in angle mode degrees so I'm
175:39 - going up by 0.1 degrees I was like why
175:41 - is it being so incredibly slow
175:50 - yeah this is interesting now I'm making
175:53 - a kind of like black and white snowflake
176:08 - pattern and okay so let's save this and
176:11 - let's try to make our snowflake
176:15 - so I'm going to start out with a sort of
176:16 - a thick line towards the
176:31 - center and I'm going to use a thinner
176:34 - line to do some nice
176:43 - detail
176:46 - there this is my snowflake that I made
176:49 - goth snowflakes people prefer the color
176:53 - okay I give up this is the end of this
176:56 - coding challenge here is a kaleidoscope
176:59 - snowflake drawing generator um I'm sure
177:03 - you can make your own version of this
177:06 - and think about color and the interface
177:07 - and all sorts of different and creative
177:09 - ways and I hope that you will do
177:13 - that
177:19 - I suppose I was hoping to collect all
177:21 - the snowflakes and make uh some kind of
177:23 - thing out of
177:24 - them
177:29 - but oh right Simon's pointing out the
177:32 - clear should also be gray I forgot that
177:34 - well let's see what it looks like if
177:35 - it's
177:37 - black because it's kind of G oh you know
177:39 - the nice thing about that is it's
177:42 - actually becomes an eraser
177:46 - so when it gets down to really dark it's
177:48 - like I can kind of erase what was
177:51 - there so I kind of like that
178:04 - actually okay Style again is done yes
178:09 - spin the canvas oh
178:12 - boy
178:14 - yeah make it so after you draw it you
178:17 - can spin
178:18 - it kind of like that idea too but I'd
178:22 - have to save it and then spin it spin
178:27 - button let's go check the Style
178:36 - again I'm let's stop let's pause for a
178:39 - second cuz I have to remind us here that
178:42 - we are in the middle of a fundraiser and
178:45 - it's also I'm going for three hours now
178:47 - so I'm not sure how much more uh energy
178:50 - I'm going to be able to
178:51 - maintain change the background it is
178:53 - pretty hard to see the
178:55 - snowflake everybody's got an
178:57 - opinion so you can go and make your own
179:00 - version of this right now I the the code
179:03 - on GitHub might take a little bit but if
179:05 - you go to this URL um which someone will
179:08 - hopefully post into the chat all you
179:09 - need to do is uh then click this little
179:12 - button and it will take you to the code
179:15 - um but I'm going to go
179:17 - back to the full
179:23 - view okay
179:33 - um how we doing here look at this we
179:36 - have got I don't know what I forget what
179:38 - this number was at the beginning of
179:40 - today um but we now have let's check
179:43 - some some new donations to thank some
179:47 - people okay Marcos himis I learned to
179:51 - program with processing and now I work
179:52 - teaching others to program using
179:54 - processing and p5js I owe you my
179:56 - professional training and my training as
179:57 - an artist thank you for all the
179:58 - excellent and committed work and Russell
180:00 - thank you for all this amazing work and
180:02 - community outreach you're changing
180:03 - people's lives that's terrific uh you
180:06 - can donate here um to support processing
180:11 - and p5js and the processing Foundation
180:13 - all the community and education
180:15 - initiatives um there are a whole bunch
180:16 - of giveaways and Gifts here that you can
180:18 - read about from artist our Brewer is in
180:20 - the chat that's that's you Russell um
180:25 - and you can also donate you know even
180:27 - just a dollar helps um right here
180:30 - through the fundraiser that's on YouTube
180:32 - itself YouTube is covering all of the
180:33 - fees um if you are a YouTuber with a
180:36 - YouTube channel and want to add this
180:37 - fundraiser to videos on your channel you
180:39 - can do that so reach out to me if you
180:41 - want and this uh
180:44 - while I figure out what next song I'm
180:46 - gonna play this song is now dedicated to
180:49 - I can't remember where I stopped
180:51 - everybody everybody but recent donations
180:53 - from Marcos and Russell and if you want
180:55 - to have this song dedicated to you you
180:58 - could make a quick donation here um
181:00 - through the YouTube U interface so let
181:02 - me check and find a song to
181:07 - do I need to eat some
181:10 - lunch uh let's see what do we got here
181:14 - anything new come
181:15 - in song idea let's take a look at this
181:19 - to the tune of Jingle
181:21 - Bells in it that in it this no more null
181:25 - references I like
181:29 - that
181:30 - uh um let's see what is what are some
181:34 - that were done recently that were
181:36 - modified recently you were missing this
181:40 - dot what is that one hour ago two hours
181:42 - ago did refactoring all the way oh
181:45 - coding train that came in just recently
181:47 - and I didn't um adjust let it code did
181:50 - we do Let It code all I want is for code
181:53 - to
181:56 - run oh this is
181:59 - another all I want for chis for
182:02 - Christmas year oh coding
182:04 - train I like this this I should be able
182:07 - to do your to felis Navid do thank you I
182:12 - really wanted something to the tune of
182:13 - Fel Nai D let's do that I'm going to do

183:25 - dot you're missing this
183:28 - dot you're missing this dot you better
183:31 - correct it or your code won't
183:34 - run I want to wish you a happy
183:38 - coding i w to wish you all happy
183:41 - coding this is right wait wait I can do
183:44 - this I can memorize the lyrics here just
183:46 - look at the I can memorize these chords
183:48 - too I should have practiced this one
183:50 - more I just thought oh this one's so
183:52 - easy we're gonna we're gonna start over
183:54 - we're gonna bring it down a notch

198:03 - look at the r look at Runway
198:07 - but if people are submitting songs all I
198:10 - want is for code to run all I want for
198:13 - Christmas is you
198:16 - okay all right we're going to do this
198:18 - song
198:26 - again this one's really hard I don't

198:42 - [Music]
198:43 - I don't need a lot I don't need a lot
198:47 - for
198:48 - coding there is just one thing I
198:51 - need in and doubles can keep
198:57 - floating underneath the binary trees I
199:02 - like
199:02 - that I just want my code to
199:06 - work just waiting for you to be
199:11 - done
199:12 - [Music]
199:15 - make oh wait I'm in a different
199:19 - part of the song
199:22 - here I just want my code to
199:28 - [Music]
199:30 - work waiting for you to be
199:33 - [Music]
199:38 - done make my code a error free no that's
199:44 - not E7 make my code sorry I was so I was
199:47 - so close there make my
199:51 - code error
199:56 - free oh all I want is for code to
200:05 - [Music]
200:10 - run I don't need need a lot for coding
200:14 - there is just one thing I need I don't
200:18 - care about these pixels underneath the
200:21 - computer
200:22 - [Music]
200:26 - screen that is awesome underneath the

207:15 - someone who cannot

207:50 - donor
207:52 - wall I will keep singing songs as long
207:54 - as donations come in you won't be able
207:57 - to get me to
208:02 - stop you can donate right here on
208:04 - YouTube itself no fees will be taken out
208:07 - the money goes straight to the
208:08 - processing Foundation of course you can
208:10 - donate here on our donor wall if you're
208:13 - interested in the giveaways and having
208:15 - your name
208:20 - here don't make me cry I cry when there
208:23 - are no donations I cry the tears they
208:27 - flow I guess I have to put my ukulele
208:30 - away so sad I just have to go back to
208:37 - coating wasn't there something else I
208:39 - was going to
208:40 - do with this Kaleidoscope example let's
208:43 - check
208:49 - Runway so
208:51 - now what we can do this is weird why is
208:54 - the FID score so
208:56 - high because it looks pretty good is it
208:58 - not updating no it's such a high FID
209:01 - score which is weird oh no no no it just
209:03 - wasn't updating it's 116 now um hold on
209:07 - sorry
209:10 - so
209:12 - um so we could now do what is called a
209:14 - latent space walk through but let's hit
209:18 - next I mean I could train this for more
209:20 - steps but oh and I can create a progress
209:22 - video so let's do this let's create the
209:23 - progress video that'll be fun to
209:27 - see and let's take a look at
209:33 - that so one of the things that Runway
209:35 - will do it will create a progress video
209:37 - which shows the model training which I
209:39 - started from flowers all the way right
209:41 - now to these
209:42 - snowflakes it's pretty nice to see then
209:45 - I can click next
209:47 - here and uh I can save this to my
209:52 - models um I can make this model
209:57 - public and I can edit the info and I can
210:01 - say this
210:02 - is
210:04 - support hash support
210:07 - P5 um
210:09 - and um
210:12 - brownan motion
210:15 - snowflakes created in processing so
210:19 - we'll do save so now this model is
210:22 - available in Runway I can add it to my
210:25 - workspace let's create a new
210:27 - workspace coding train
210:31 - ton and now so once you've trained a
210:35 - model most of the time when using Runway
210:37 - there's a pre-train model but I can go
210:39 - here and switch this to a vector input
210:42 - put and oh I've got to run I've got to
210:44 - run the model run remotely this is going
210:46 - to use I'm you there's there's a lot
210:48 - more to say about all the things in
210:50 - Runway and I have some videos that cover
210:51 - that and check out the runway ml website
210:53 - but what I'm doing now is the model is
210:55 - being run on a g Cloud GPU and it's
210:58 - starting up it'll take a little bit once
211:00 - it starts up I'm going to see a grid of
211:03 - images generated from the model and then
211:07 - I can in make a P5 sketch to uh get one
211:11 - of those W look at there there we go
211:13 - here is my style Gan generated uh
211:16 - snowflakes what I really like to do is
211:19 - generate a latent Space
211:21 - Walk and by that means I want to create
211:24 - an animation that essentially goes from
211:27 - one to the other that just sort of like
211:28 - walks through the latent
211:31 - space um and I have some code that does
211:35 - this um where where where where and I
211:38 - and I think I'm kind of running out of
211:40 - parts like
211:42 - 1:30 I mean four this is if I I'm going
211:45 - to be done at two because that's going
211:46 - to be four hours I can't go more than
211:48 - four hours I got some stuff to do folks
211:51 - of course if you keep donating I might
211:53 - stay a little longer sing some more
211:58 - songs but let's at least let's let's try
212:00 - to make this um lat and Space Walk how
212:03 - do I want to do this can't I don't
212:05 - remember so I think what I'm going to do
212:07 - just to sort of speed things along here
212:08 - is I'm going to go to my course that i t
212:11 - this semester which is on uh github.com
212:15 - ml5.js so ml5 is a project not from the
212:18 - processing Foundation but is a library
212:20 - for p5js and it wouldn't be able to
212:22 - exist without the processing foundation
212:24 - in p5js so if you want ml5 to continue
212:28 - you should donate to P5 and support
212:31 - P5 um so ah here's my syllabus and
212:35 - somewhere in here Runway
212:38 - ml um got a lot of materials
212:45 - sing don't think this is the one do I
212:48 - did I make an example for style Gan I
212:50 - can't remember uh yes wandering latent
212:53 - space style Gan code
212:58 - examples so what do I have there oh look
213:02 - at this how lucky am
213:06 - I
213:08 - okay well this was nice I had this
213:11 - example let me just talk you through it
213:13 - a little bit I'm going to come I'm going
213:14 - to do some proper tutorials about
213:16 - generative machine learning models and
213:18 - lat and space and how to do a walk
213:20 - random walk through late in space but I
213:23 - you know three and a half hours in I I
213:25 - just do not have I cannot I can summon
213:27 - the energy to sing another holiday song
213:29 - but I don't know that I could summon
213:30 - energy to code all this from scratch
213:34 - um so let's see so what I'm going to
213:38 - explain to you is that
213:41 - um any
213:43 - image that you generate uh let's go back
213:47 - to Runway that's generated through a uh
213:50 - style Gan and this applies to lots of
213:52 - other kind of generative models as well
213:54 - the input is a vector often called a z
213:57 - Vector it's just a list of numbers and
213:59 - this has to do with how
214:02 - um if I were to like really go back and
214:04 - explain this I might start with looking
214:06 - at what an autoencoder does and how an
214:07 - autoencoder takes an image as an input
214:10 - and compresses it down to a vector of
214:12 - numbers and then reconstructs the image
214:14 - and that Vector of numbers is
214:15 - essentially like a fingerprint or a
214:17 - signature for that image and that's
214:19 - actually What's Happening Here in Runway
214:21 - and I could even just go I think if I
214:22 - click on this oh that's gonna what's
214:25 - that going to do what do these buttons
214:26 - do the download oh this yeah I think
214:28 - this saves the vector so for example
214:32 - look at this look at this snowflake
214:35 - right here I am going to to the
214:39 - desktop
214:41 - oh uh whoa what's going
214:44 - on I'm losing my mind
214:51 - here refresh no download not download
214:55 - the
214:57 - image this usually downloads a file with
214:59 - the vector doesn't
215:02 - it did I break
215:07 - Runway but the point is oh oh we got
215:11 - another
215:12 - donation Fatima KH thank you thank you
215:16 - Fatima KH a song will shortly be
215:18 - dedicated to you after I get this
215:21 - going but I can so what I can do is if I
215:24 - go to this network
215:26 - tab I can send an array of 512 numbers
215:31 - and it's going to send me back a base 64
215:33 - encoded image which is the image that is
215:34 - generated so my example code here it's
215:37 - um I probably should start from a more
215:39 - basic one
215:41 - where was I
215:43 - there let go back
215:46 - here I'm not going to do the walk first
215:48 - generate style Gan image this is perf
215:50 - this is what I wanted to do if I just
215:54 - generate 512 random numbers between
215:57 - negative 1 and one make that the Z
216:00 - Vector that I
216:03 - post that I post to Runway Runway is
216:06 - actually running a web server there's a
216:07 - lot going on Runway is deployed the
216:10 - style game model to the cloud but it's
216:11 - also running a local web server that I
216:13 - can talk to and then it talks to the
216:14 - cloud justs the image get it back all
216:16 - that sort of stuff so this should when I
216:18 - run it
216:20 - now if I click
216:22 - generate I see the style Gan generated
216:25 - Snowflake and I'm just every time I
216:27 - click generate I'm getting a random one
216:28 - here in P5 and you could do this in
216:30 - processing too with that processing
216:31 - Library I mentioned but what I want to
216:33 - show you is if what I do is instead of
216:38 - creating a z vector or new random
216:41 - complete set of random numbers every
216:42 - single time if I take those random
216:44 - numbers and adjust them ever so slightly
216:46 - I get a similar looking snowflake that's
216:49 - near it in this multi-dimensional latent
216:52 - space I got to come back and do a proper
216:54 - tutorial explaining all the details of
216:56 - this stuff but this is the basic idea
216:59 - and so now if I go back to this one what
217:02 - you'll see is this is a demonstration
217:05 - where I can I have it sort of commented
217:08 - out but I can do three different kinds
217:10 - of random walks so I could just randomly
217:14 - adjust the numbers I could use pearlin
217:17 - noise to move about the space or I could
217:21 - even make a sort of velocity Vector of
217:23 - 512 numbers and move in a continuous
217:25 - Direction so I've left this commented
217:27 - out with this one so now I think you can
217:31 - see um you can see it's like
217:34 - changing ever so slightly and if what I
217:38 - do generate image
217:40 - [Music]
217:41 - image generates the
217:43 - image I want to every time I generate
217:46 - the image save
217:49 - it so what if instead of having
217:56 - draw What If instead of having draw
217:58 - whenever I get the
218:02 - image is this going to
218:05 - work I just draw it I think this is not
218:08 - going to work ah because I need a call
218:14 - back this is very frustrating but I
218:17 - think this um I'm going to create I I
218:21 - want to just save them one at a
218:24 - time there we go perfect and then I
218:27 - don't want to call generate image here I
218:30 - want to then say
218:34 - save um
218:38 - snowflake uh. PNG
218:41 - G and then then call generate image
218:45 - again so now what I wanted this is going
218:47 - to be a little bit nuts cuz I'm just
218:48 - going to save it all to my downloads
218:49 - directory but let's go
218:52 - ahead so you can see all of these
218:56 - snowflake files are just saving saving
218:57 - saving saving saving saving saving
218:59 - saving saving to my downloads directory
219:00 - let's let this go for a little
219:03 - while um and we'll let this go for a
219:05 - little while and then I
219:08 - will um dedicate a song to Fatima Khan
219:11 - and maybe there are some other donations
219:15 - that have come in on the donor
219:18 - wall yeah yeah yeah I don't know why
219:20 - that just popped
219:23 - up oh yeah sure I I don't know why no
219:26 - stop ah help
219:28 - okay I guess I can't leave this window
219:32 - what is going
219:35 - on stop pop up I've killed the
219:39 - browser
219:42 - do I have two multiple things running
219:45 - no all right let's check this it's still
219:49 - going didn't I stop it there we go
219:56 - okay refresh the page
220:00 - no
220:05 - no
220:07 - let's all right I'm just going to go to
220:09 - the donor
220:12 - wall I'm going to kill the browser go
220:15 - away
220:17 - browser downloads in progress
220:25 - quit come back to me browser
220:31 - restore and we shall see okay well we're
220:34 - on the same donate but we do have a do
220:36 - no
220:37 - donation so Fatima will get a song
220:42 - we did jingle jar we did you're missing
220:45 - this dot oh coding
220:48 - train all I want for code to run I think
220:50 - I tried that but I sort of
220:52 - failed do we have any new songs there's
220:57 - some issues that have come in processing
220:59 - Rock All Right processing Rock we've got
221:03 - two of
221:03 - them
221:09 - okay
221:12 - all right well we can do both of these
221:15 - because they're short two different
221:21 - verses I'm very
221:24 - hungry I need to eat some lunch people
221:27 - but if you donate I will stay here I'm
221:29 - about to go on vacation so I can handle
221:30 - an extra little bit extra
221:37 - time am I in tune I've got to be in tune
221:40 - tune for

222:38 - processing and p52
222:40 - I oh shoot I oh yeah
222:45 - sorry processing processing and
222:48 - p52 I don't know how I'd code without
222:52 - you you inspire all my coding

223:06 - the processing that's the processing
223:09 - that's the processing

223:17 - Rock what a what a bright what a what a
223:22 - bright time is the right time to code
223:26 - the night
223:29 - away processing time is a swell
223:35 - time to go debugging in uh
223:40 - the processing

224:00 - you that's the
224:02 - processing I got it that's the
224:05 - processing that's the processing
224:08 - r
224:15 - all right let's go to this one oh whoa
224:17 - this one's got like a lot of lyrics okay
224:22 - now that I practiced thank you aramam
224:28 - Tim I don't know do you like this this
224:31 - background behind me I feel like it kind
224:32 - of it's nice to sort of just have this
224:35 - generic
224:38 - background so there's a swing strum
224:41 - which is down down down up down down up
224:44 - down down up down down up down down up
224:47 - down down up down down up down then
224:50 - there's the shuffle Island strum which
224:52 - is down down
224:59 - up processing processing processing Rock
225:04 - code all the things with a MH with I
225:08 - forgot okay I really had a pick CU I but
225:12 - I don't know that a pick is really that
225:13 - helpful all right here we go everyone oh
225:17 - a two one 2 3 4 processing processing
225:21 - processing Rock cat all the things with
225:25 - machine
225:28 - learning coding debugging it's so much
225:33 - fun now the coding hop has begun
225:38 - processing processing ing processing
225:41 - processing Rock the stakes are fine it's
225:44 - not a
225:46 - crime working code can be awfully
225:51 - rare debug without a care what a right
225:56 - time it's the right time to code the
226:00 - night
226:01 - away processing time is a coding
226:07 - time to try debugging in an to try

226:38 - processing that's the processing that's
226:42 - the pro processing
226:45 - [Music]
226:47 - rock thank you thank you thank you very
226:50 - much thank
226:51 - you
226:54 - okay
226:57 - now now we can make our Laten space
227:00 - animation wait
227:02 - whoops oh I like this one I I feel like
227:05 - I'm my strumming is off you
227:08 - know
227:10 - next year next year I'm going to be so
227:11 - much
227:13 - better okay um I now what I think if I
227:17 - go to my downloads directory there are
227:20 - zillions of these snowflake images so
227:22 - let me make another folder called
227:23 - snowflakes and let me put all of them in
227:26 - there o what is going on oh weird
227:30 - something weird happened because I was
227:31 - like downloading them in a different way
227:33 - let's just go to here I don't know
227:35 - something might be in a weird order but
227:37 - let's put them all in there now one of
227:38 - the things you might not know processing
227:41 - itself has under Tools something called
227:43 - Movie Maker so if I take any folder on
227:47 - my computer like this one and drag it in
227:50 - here and I'm just going to click same
227:51 - size as Originals uh with no compression
227:54 - I can processing has a tool which will
227:57 - take a whole directory of pgs or images
227:59 - and Stitch them together into a movie
228:01 - I'm going to say 30 frames per second
228:03 - I'm going to say create movie and I'm
228:05 - going to call this
228:07 - snowflakes let's just put it on the
228:09 - desktop
228:17 - and is it
228:22 - going I see it there did it make it
228:26 - already usually I see a nice
228:28 - little interface that shows it's uh
228:38 - running
228:41 - weird hold on let me try this I think
228:42 - something's weird the way these images
228:44 - got numbered which is a little
228:46 - frustrating to me because usually I
228:48 - number them manually and then
228:52 - um um then Al so what usually I number
228:55 - them manually which maybe I'll I'll
228:56 - switch into do um Wallace F Mori donate
229:00 - isn't available to Brazilians so if you
229:02 - can't donate through the YouTube
229:03 - interface you are welcome to give a
229:06 - donation uh the donorbox link it's
229:08 - donorbox.org
229:09 - /s support
229:11 - pf29 fundraising D campaign we are up to
229:16 - um on uh donor box we are up to $1
229:24 - 14,713 which really should be possible
229:27 - there are a lot of people who use these
229:29 - tools a lot of Institutions there's no
229:31 - reason why we can't reach that goal
229:33 - spread the word help I realize that um
229:35 - people do not have the means necessarily
229:36 - to donate a lot and maybe or donate all
229:39 - all which is totally fine but you can
229:41 - help by spreading the
229:42 - word um
229:45 - and there we go so let me try running
229:48 - this
229:49 - again let me do something different here
229:52 - can I name the
229:53 - images myself and have
229:58 - them whoa this is the wrong
230:01 - sketch oh boy oh because I hadn't saved
230:05 - it oh I made those changes then I
230:06 - crashed the
230:08 - browser
230:09 - Chris Spurgeon donated
230:12 - $50 we will be doing another song thank
230:14 - you Chris Spurgeon here is a snowflake
230:17 - pattern that I will make for you this
230:19 - snowflake pattern is dedicated
230:23 - to Yes it please it's sixfold symmetry
230:25 - it looks like it might be 12 but it's
230:27 - not look six
230:30 - six um and I can save this
230:34 - snowflake uh Chris Pon snowflake for you
230:37 - okay and song coming up in a second
230:43 - um right I want to show you this movie
230:46 - maker so give me a second
230:54 - here I don't know what
230:57 - happened why this didn't work so let's
231:00 - go to
231:02 - downloads
231:04 - snowflakes I think these file names are
231:06 - a little wonky and I could write a
231:09 - program to like resave them
231:12 - all I have a crazy idea I shouldn't I
231:16 - shouldn't do what I'm about to
231:19 - do uh all right I'm going to where do I
231:22 - have I'm going
231:28 - to find hold on I'm just gonna find some
231:31 - code I wrote um so I gotta like go into
231:34 - the deep recesses of my computer so I'm
231:37 - just going to uh leave this here for a
231:40 - second I'm going to find something
231:41 - else that I've
231:43 - written um just I have to find it on my
232:04 - computer documents documents okay here
232:30 - [Music]
232:38 - for
232:42 - [Music]
232:54 - okay should be good
232:58 - [Music]
233:07 - now
233:11 - [Music]
233:17 - [Music]
233:20 - okay so I have another processing
233:23 - sketch that I have written here no no no
233:25 - no no no no
233:29 - no it's not what I meant to do let's
233:31 - open up this so this is another
233:33 - processing sketch which is based on
233:36 - examples by George pereno who's the
233:38 - creator of the the runway processing
233:40 - Library which is actually imported here
233:43 - oh let's see Dennis king4 donated $5
233:46 - thank
233:48 - you um Mason has to sign off thank you
233:52 - for watching and for writing some nice
233:54 - songs for me Mason sickler thank you um
233:58 - I gotta go soon too but i' I've
234:00 - determined to get through a few more
234:01 - things um yeah I don't know if I want to
234:05 - install this update but fine um so one
234:08 - thing I need is do sketch import Library
234:10 - I don't know if Runway has been
234:12 - published has the runway Library been
234:14 - published yes great so I need to install
234:16 - this
234:17 - library because it's going to use it so
234:19 - the runway library is now installed and
234:22 - this is using this doing the same exact
234:24 - thing it's a little weird message from
234:26 - OBS Studio that it disconnected so I
234:29 - don't know if the stream just went down
234:31 - but I'm think I might disc I think it
234:33 - might have disconnected from the stream
234:35 - deck thing it might have been that okay
234:37 - let's see if this works
234:40 - so hold on let me close out
234:44 - it uh Visual Studio code does not need
234:47 - to be open so the model is running again
234:51 - me open this up
234:54 - again we'll wait for the model to be
235:05 - running oh it's
235:07 - running so
235:19 - now on
235:21 - quit I really want I think processing
235:23 - needs to be I think
235:25 - it's it's freaked out
235:28 - people there we go okay the model is
235:32 - running by the way this is what I oh
235:35 - yeah okay that's the Z Vector that was
235:38 - sent
235:39 - you open up processing so one thing I
235:41 - want to check is that the model is
235:43 - running on Local Host 8000 at the
235:47 - endpoint
235:50 - query so now I should be able to just
235:53 - double check that the runway library is
235:58 - initialized
235:59 - correctly um I guess it depicts all the
236:02 - default ports and
236:04 - everything there we go okay oh thank
236:07 - goodness so now this is uh working and
236:12 - let me see do I have save image Set uh
236:15 - save frame output coding TR great so
236:20 - great so there we go so here's all of
236:22 - the snowflake
236:25 - images that it's generating and I wanted
236:29 - to do
236:30 - it
236:32 - um I'll just let it go for a while and
236:35 - I'll dedicate a song to the recent
236:37 - donors
236:39 - um Dennis and Chris Spurgeon all right
236:44 - let's let this run for a little
236:48 - bit we're gonna make our Laton space
236:50 - animation before the end of this live
236:56 - stream I wonder if I should have it go
236:58 - through the space more quickly ah it's
237:01 - fine it's fine okay so let's let's let
237:03 - that go and then I need to go to holiday
237:07 - songs
237:09 - any new holiday songs we got processing
237:11 - Rock processing
237:12 - Rock uh well it might be time for the 12
237:17 - days of
237:24 - coding
237:33 - okay it's 81 and a half degrees in here
237:44 - 12
237:46 - days under T do we
237:53 - think there's a hundred songs in this
237:57 - book this is the book I'm looking at I
238:00 - do not see 12
238:02 - days I'm sure I could find the chord
238:04 - somewhere
238:07 - else
238:09 - no well I've got no
238:12 - well the 12 days of there it is the it's
238:15 - under
238:17 - theth uh no it's not it's under 12
238:19 - spelled out I just was looking in the
238:21 - wrong place
238:37 - 126
238:39 - [Music]
238:42 - on the first day of
238:50 - coding on the first day of coding my oh
238:55 - B flat
238:58 - what my true love gave to
239:04 - me

245:52 - snowflake animation boy was that worth
245:54 - it or
245:55 - what so this just to just a recap a
245:59 - processing sketch used brownie in motion
246:02 - to generate 2,000 snowflakes that were
246:04 - then uploaded to Runway to train a style
246:07 - Gan model to generate snowflakes in the
246:09 - style of the brownie motion snowflakes
246:12 - that
246:13 - then processing requested from Runway
246:16 - and got a whole bunch of new ones and
246:18 - generated this
246:23 - animation thank
246:26 - you thank

247:16 - match wait oh I'm going to match all
247:19 - donations that come in today up to
247:22 - $1,000 for processing
247:24 - foundation and um I'm just going to the
247:29 - we're up to wow we're up to
247:31 - $711 through just the YouTube interface
247:34 - itself that is great we need more people
247:37 - if you want to use processing and P5 and
247:39 - all those things in
247:42 - 2020 donate or I know a lot of you can't
247:45 - donate there's plenty of other ways you
247:46 - could contribute um I've talked about
247:48 - all that stuff go back to the beginning
247:49 - of this live stream when I was much more
247:51 - articulate and eloquent about talking
247:53 - about the processing Foundation all that
247:54 - stuff but here we
247:58 - go okay we're going to see if any new
248:00 - donations have come in
248:03 - here I know that some have come in

248:29 - that came in through YouTube that I
248:30 - believe I thanked and I was trying to
248:32 - you do the 12
248:34 - days of uh coding let's check our song
248:39 - songs
248:42 - here
248:51 - um
248:59 - [Music]
249:04 - okay I'm waiting people I'm waiting I
249:08 - will I will attempt this 12 days of
249:10 - coding even
249:15 - though but what um these two there's two
249:18 - of
249:21 - them I will attempt
249:28 - these even with these difficult
249:33 - chords even without the chords in the
249:37 - lyrics which which would makes things
249:38 - much easier that's a way you could
249:40 - contribute you could transpose this for
249:42 - me into much friendlier cords that don't
249:45 - include a B flat got to practice that
249:48 - one I need like extra
249:50 - fingers this is not
249:55 - something it's not so bad

255:44 - coding P5 gave to gave to
255:50 - me a no pointing
255:55 - binary whoa okay hold on I need some
255:57 - practice here on the first day of
256:02 - coding P5 gave to me p
256:07 - gave to
256:13 - me a no pointing binary oh no no a no
256:19 - pointing bin whoa this is part in a
256:25 - tree this is not what these chords are

267:16 - holidays everyone happy New Year thank
267:19 - you for 2019 it's been fun to bring the
267:22 - coding train to you which would not be
267:24 - possible not even close to possible
267:27 - without the processing Foundation all
267:28 - the contributors of the different open
267:29 - source projects people who can
267:31 - contribute it in a myriad of different
267:32 - ways from writing code to documentation
267:35 - to teaching to tutorials to creating
267:36 - artworks to bringing it to people in
267:38 - their local communities all over the
267:40 - world please continue to do so in 2020
267:43 - if you have the means support the
267:45 - processing Foundation talk to your
267:46 - institution about supporting the
267:48 - processing Foundation uh you go to a
267:51 - school and they spend lots of money on
267:53 - software like Adobe Creative Suite and
267:56 - other types of 3D rendering stuff that I
267:59 - don't know how to use maybe just maybe
268:02 - they might also like to uh spend some
268:04 - money on process and p5js and we can
268:07 - actually generate an invoice for you so

269:19 - numbers math formulas about the 12 days
269:21 - of coding
269:27 - presence what's happening on support
269:32 - P5 okay oh
269:36 - we're going to see we're going to see
269:39 - are we going to get any more

270:11 - can't even hear her maybe she wants to
270:14 - hear another song I don't know why
270:15 - because I'm terrible at singing these
270:17 - songs but you know maybe to a
270:21 - three-year-old I'm sure she has very
270:22 - sophisticated ears but maybe I'm just
270:24 - like a a nice person attempting to sing
270:26 - and it's it's encouraging other people
270:28 - who are not so good at this kind of
270:29 - stuff to attempt as

271:32 - hours I don't know I expected at least
271:35 - one more to come in this is kind of
271:38 - anticlimactic let's go look at the code
271:40 - that I made wasn't there something else
271:41 - I was going to do with
271:43 - this I don't know if I'm going to be
271:45 - able to make this into a coding
271:46 - challenge video because I don't
271:56 - remember I don't
271:58 - remember where I left off or what I was
272:04 - saying
272:10 - I want to make a nice little snowflake I

274:02 - [Music]
274:04 - go
274:09 - on the first try at
274:13 - debugging I thought I fixed the
274:18 - bug and now I think I should give
274:24 - up on the second try at
274:27 - debugging I thought I'd fix the
274:30 - [Music]
274:34 - bug
274:35 - two Miss do this dots and now I think
274:40 - that I should give

274:47 - debugging I thought I fixed the
274:50 - bug three digits
274:53 - off two missed this dots and I think
274:58 - that I should give
275:02 - up on my fourth try
275:05 - at De bug fourth try at
275:09 - debuging I thought I'd fix the
275:12 - [Music]
275:13 - bug four times the call back's
275:17 - called three digits off two missed this
275:21 - dots and now I think that I should give
275:26 - up got move faster
275:28 - here on the fifth try at
275:32 - debuging i' thought I'd fix the

275:56 - three digits off two miss this dots and
276:01 - I now I think that I should give up
276:07 - on the six try

276:16 - exist five
276:20 - cons
276:23 - LS four times the call back's been

277:03 - and I now I think that I should give
277:07 - [Music]
277:08 - up on my eighth try at debugging I
277:13 - thought I'd fix the

277:28 - called three digits off to miss this
277:31 - dos and now I think that I should give
277:35 - give
277:37 - up on the ninth try at debugging I
277:41 - thought I'd fix the
277:43 - bug nine functions I didn't comp eight
277:46 - hard code number seven wrong algorithm
277:47 - six fars donic five golden rings four
277:51 - times call backs been called three
277:53 - digits off two miss this do and now I
277:55 - think that I should give

278:02 - I'd fix the bug s Miss 10 missing

278:10 - six fars don't exist five console logs
278:14 - four times the Call's been called three
278:16 - digits off to miss this do now I think
278:19 - that I should give
278:23 - up on the 11th try at debugging try
278:27 - debugging I thought I fix the bug 11
278:30 - levels of complexity 10 missing
278:32 - resources nine fun in comment eight art

278:41 - four times the call back's been called
278:42 - three digits off to miss the dos and now
278:45 - I think that I should give up on the
