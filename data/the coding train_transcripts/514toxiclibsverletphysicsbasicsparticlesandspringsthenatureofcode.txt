00:03 - hi okay we are ready to make our very
00:05 - first toxic Libs particle and spring
00:08 - example um this is actually the example
00:11 - it's the one that we are going to make
00:12 - or it's already made so we're just going
00:14 - to look at it and talk through it um but
00:16 - you can see this looks very much like
00:19 - many examples we've had before in the
00:20 - past we have this swinging object
00:23 - connected to another object how is that
00:25 - working I can also click the mouse here
00:27 - and I can pull this object around I want
00:29 - to let go
00:30 - it's a little bit elastic and bounces
00:31 - back and forth this is a very simple
00:33 - system it's got two particles in it and
00:36 - one spring connecting it and the world
00:38 - has gravity so if we can understand how
00:41 - to make this everything else we make in
00:43 - toxic Libs is just an extension of this
00:45 - it's more particles it's more spring
00:46 - configurations and whatever imaginative
00:49 - creative exciting way that you can kind
00:50 - of put all this stuff together okay so
00:53 - how do we make something like this okay
00:54 - so there's a few things that we need to
00:56 - know about number one is let's just
00:58 - think for a moment it's a little weird
01:00 - to me actually that we did boxd before
01:01 - toxic Clips but that's what happened
01:03 - although I suppose these videos should
01:05 - be independent of themselves and not
01:07 - require you to have watched box 2D so uh
01:11 - I'm talking to myself I realize but all
01:13 - of this is just me talking to myself
01:14 - really um so uh let's think about this
01:17 - for a second what are the elements of a
01:20 - toxic Libs verlet physics world so if
01:22 - you didn't watch the box videos it's
01:24 - okay but I'm going to make this make
01:25 - sense a little bit in box 2D there's
01:27 - something called a world then there's a
01:31 - body and then there are bodies have
01:34 - shapes and
01:36 - fixtures and then there's this thing
01:38 - called a joint so toxic clipse a joint
01:41 - so a body is the thing moving around the
01:43 - world the world is the world that the
01:45 - bodies move around and a joint is the
01:47 - thing that connects two bodies toxic
01:49 - Libs the way that we think about toxic
01:51 - Libs is going to operate in exactly the
01:53 - same way the world is going to be called
01:56 - verlet physics so we're going to make a
01:59 - verlet physics object it's a verlet
02:01 - physics world and in our case in our
02:03 - examples we're actually going to make a
02:05 - veret physics 2D object so you can do it
02:07 - in 3D or 2D but for my examples for
02:10 - Simplicity we're sticking within 2D
02:11 - although it would be nice to have a 3D
02:13 - one and a 3D video and I add that to the
02:16 - list of everything we will always and
02:17 - forever wish we had and make eventually
02:20 - okay a body is a particle so a particle
02:24 - is the thing that's going to move around
02:26 - the verlet physics World we're going to
02:27 - make a world we're going to put
02:29 - particles in it and watch those
02:30 - particles move about particles by the
02:33 - way can have those behaviors they can be
02:34 - attractive or repulsive which is
02:36 - something very exciting that we're going
02:37 - to see a few examples from now a joint
02:41 - in toxic Libs we're going to think of as
02:43 - a
02:44 - spring so a spring is a thing that
02:46 - connects two particles one of the great
02:48 - things about toxic Libs is it has a
02:50 - different kinds of Springs it has a
02:52 - plain old verlet spring it has a verlet
02:55 - minimum constrained spring which I'm
02:57 - obviously giving it the ex the not
02:59 - exactly the correct name right now but
03:01 - you'll see there's various constraints
03:02 - we can put on the spring to make sure
03:04 - that it can't like stretch Beyond a
03:06 - certain distance or Shrink Beyond a
03:07 - certain distance which can allow us to
03:09 - really control the stability of a system
03:11 - if we need to so these are the things we
03:13 - need to be feel comfortable with we're
03:15 - going to make a verlet physics object
03:16 - we're going to make a particle object
03:18 - we're going to make two particle objects
03:19 - you know if we look back at this example
03:21 - we're going to make a world verlet
03:22 - physics we're going to make two particle
03:24 - objects and one spring
03:26 - object there's one missing piece though
03:28 - to this list that I haven't mentioned
03:31 - right remember we had P Vector good old
03:34 - days back when we had P Vector we'd say
03:36 - p Vector location equals a new P vector
03:39 - and we were so happy and then we had box
03:41 - 2D and we had VC 2 VC 2 right we were a
03:44 - little bit uncomfortable but we kind of
03:46 - got used to it and we we felt
03:48 - glad now we have VC 2D and VEC 3D so yet
03:55 - again another set of vector objects
03:58 - Vector classes to work with in in toxic
04:01 - Libs but we should be rejoicing again
04:03 - because one of the nice things about the
04:04 - vector classes in toxic Libs is that
04:06 - they are more advanced than the vector
04:08 - classes in processing there are many
04:10 - more functions they're a bit more
04:11 - sophisticated to use and thus perhaps
04:14 - not as not as easy to use but there's a
04:16 - lot of power there especially when the
04:18 - vectors are separated out you know
04:20 - whether you're using a 2d vector or a 3D
04:22 - Vector perhaps it's not as simple to
04:24 - like kind of know why I think I'm like
04:28 - trying to justify why P vector in my
04:30 - mind is the way made the way that it is
04:32 - but um I think these are wonderful um
04:35 - Vector classes that we're going to use
04:37 - with toxic lives I I mean I love Vector
04:39 - classes we can't have can't have enough
04:40 - of them somebody make one
04:43 - called G Vector s Vector I don't know
04:47 - whatever okay so this is the picture
04:50 - this is what we've got
04:52 - now we have another thing to
04:55 - discuss this is this is the really
04:57 - exciting part we haven't even gotten to
04:59 - five minutes yet I feel like we're
05:00 - totally on Pace here now that we know
05:02 - the elements of the world how do we
05:05 - actually make these elements in the
05:07 - world okay so back again if you remember
05:11 - back to the the olden
05:14 - days we wrote something called class
05:18 - mover and in the Mover itself we had
05:21 - three p vectors location velocity
05:24 - acceleration we wrote that update method
05:27 - ourselves which had Oiler
05:30 - integration blah blah blah I'm sort of
05:33 - half writing here right this is what we
05:35 - did all on our own this was our mover
05:37 - class we were very proud of it we're
05:39 - still going to use it you're going to
05:40 - use it we're going to love it and take
05:42 - care of it um this is what we made then
05:45 - we got to this place where we said ha oh
05:48 - the camera went
05:52 - off hello again we got to this place I
05:55 - hope it recorded through that we got to
05:57 - this place where we we arrived at box
05:59 - and we said you know what boxd is going
06:01 - to handle the physics for us we don't
06:03 - have to keep track of location velocity
06:04 - acceleration have an update method what
06:06 - we're just going to do is we're going to
06:08 - make a uh let's just still call it a
06:11 - mover I guess I guess I like calling
06:14 - these particles so let's call it a
06:15 - particle I should have called the first
06:17 - one a
06:18 - particle and it kind of we made this
06:20 - particle and we put a body in
06:22 - it so a par object was essentially a
06:26 - wrapper for a box 2D object and we could
06:28 - say like we could always just add forces
06:30 - to it or we could initialize it and then
06:33 - ask where it is so we could draw it we
06:34 - had this reference to a box body that
06:36 - was in the Box world that we could just
06:38 - sort of deal with all the time
06:41 - now as if these weren't two great
06:43 - options on their own the greatest option
06:45 - of them all is what we're going to do
06:47 - with toxic
06:49 - lives if you go back and review those
06:51 - particle System videos one of the things
06:54 - we spent some time learning about was
06:55 - inheritance oh we have this base
06:57 - particle class that has all the sort of
06:59 - physic of particles and we can just
07:00 - extend it to make star and rainbow and
07:03 - sparkly particles
07:05 - now we're going to do the same thing
07:07 - with toxic Libs only we're not going to
07:09 - write that particle class not at all we
07:11 - are going to just inherit toxic Libs
07:13 - particle class we're going to say
07:16 - class
07:18 - particle ah
07:22 - extends verlet particle so the name of
07:25 - the actual object into toxic lies and in
07:27 - our case it's going to be verlet
07:28 - particle 2D is verlet particle so we're
07:31 - going to say we in we don't need to
07:35 - write the physics all we need to do is
07:37 - write our display
07:40 - method and our display method might draw
07:44 - a circle at the
07:46 - XY where that particle is this is a
07:49 - really fantastic way of working we're
07:51 - getting all of the methods our particle
07:54 - is a ver particle it has it has the
07:56 - ability to have attraction and repulsion
07:57 - forces has ability to be part of a
07:59 - spring it has ability it it it knows how
08:01 - to update itself for in the physics
08:03 - world when the physics world gets
08:04 - updated everything is controlled by
08:07 - toxic Libs but we can just write our own
08:09 - we can interject our own design here or
08:11 - we could add variables we could add a
08:12 - color variable to it if we want to keep
08:14 - track of its color or other variables to
08:16 - it if we wanted to and we can um we can
08:19 - apply forces to we can do all sorts of
08:21 - things to it so these are really the
08:23 - three methods we've now covered in this
08:25 - course or set of videos or book or
08:27 - whatever you want to call it it's
08:28 - writing everything from scratch on our
08:30 - own it's using a physics engine where we
08:33 - just bring in a variable to reference an
08:35 - entity in that physics engine or what I
08:37 - like at best here is this idea of
08:40 - extending of an object that lives in a
08:42 - physics world so the object what we
08:44 - inherit all the physics and we put our
08:45 - own design on it now there's something
08:49 - kind of funny going on here that I would
08:51 - like to point out which I think is even
08:53 - more exciting than just this what we've
08:55 - done here just alone so one of the
08:57 - things that's super interesting about
08:58 - this is
09:00 - okay so where is the objects like here
09:01 - we had this P Vector location so
09:04 - shouldn't maybe particle verlet particle
09:07 - have a VC 2D right if V 2D is the object
09:10 - in toxic Libs it should have a VC 2D
09:13 - position not a uh um right and we should
09:16 - be saying ellipse at position dox
09:18 - position doy but instead we have X and Y
09:21 - so verlet particle we must have
09:22 - inherited just an X and A Y how do we do
09:24 - that it turns out that verlet particle
09:27 - itself extends vect 2D right a vector is
09:32 - a can be a location on the screen a
09:35 - particle can be a location on the screen
09:37 - with all this added
09:39 - functionality and then our particle is
09:42 - our own design on top of that so not
09:45 - only does our particle extend verlet
09:47 - particle 2D it has all of the vector
09:49 - functions built into it right there so
09:51 - this is a really tremendous way of
09:52 - working and I think a very smart way of
09:54 - Designing a physics engine and in many
09:55 - sense we might have wanted to do that
09:57 - with our mover class mover extends P
09:59 - Vector but you know I think that would
10:01 - have been a very difficult way to just
10:03 - start right from the beginning like it
10:05 - was much simpler to kind of start to
10:06 - learn by putting P vectors in our code
10:08 - rather than have our mover be a p Vector
10:10 - also suddenly additionally with velocity
10:12 - and acceleration but that is something
10:14 - to that is very important to realize
10:15 - when working with toxic Libs your
10:17 - particle not only inherits from verlet
10:19 - particle 2D it also inherits from ve v v
10:23 - 2D okay so now that we've kind of gotten
10:26 - that out of the way let's take a look at
10:29 - where this appears in the actual code
10:32 - example and I have a feeling I might
10:33 - have to fix this camera yes okay uh
10:35 - seeing like I don't know
10:38 - um you say it's your birthday I don't
10:41 - know what U that that's the song I
10:43 - thought of oh my God okay so let's take
10:46 - a look at this example first let's point
10:48 - out the beauty of
10:50 - this look at the beauty of
10:52 - this experience it right this is our
10:55 - particle class it extends verlet
10:57 - particle Duty it has no Cod and it has
10:59 - no location velocity acceleration no
11:01 - update no physics no this no that all it
11:03 - has is our display function so if you
11:05 - are the kind of person who wants your
11:06 - physics taken care of for you but you
11:08 - want to really control the intricacies
11:11 - of how you're drawing stuff on the
11:12 - screen this is a fantastic way to work
11:15 - um you can really just work on adding a
11:17 - display method to the particle which
11:18 - extends verlet particle 2D so now if we
11:21 - look into the main program we can see a
11:24 - few things here one is here's our world
11:26 - furlet physics 2D physics that's the
11:28 - world we need to set up we have two
11:30 - particle objects those are our particle
11:32 - objects but they extend verlet particle
11:35 - 2D and a couple things I should point
11:37 - out this is a little bit of an odd line
11:39 - of code which will make sense a bit more
11:41 - to us later when we look at behaviors
11:43 - but the world has a gravity behavior in
11:46 - it meaning um you know gravity doesn't
11:49 - just exist out of nowhere but one of the
11:50 - things we can add to our verlet physics
11:52 - world is a a kind of global force that
11:55 - points in a given Direction in this case
11:57 - we have that Force Point down so that
11:59 - looks like you know kind of 2D gravity
12:01 - on the screen um we can also set the
12:03 - boundaries of a world which makes
12:04 - objects not able to go beyond those
12:06 - boundaries you can pick or choose
12:07 - whether you want that and then here we
12:09 - are making two particles one at one
12:12 - location and one at the other and if uh
12:16 - if I take out the Gravity by the way and
12:19 - run it you will see look I made two
12:21 - particles one here and one there one at
12:23 - width divided by two comma 20 one at
12:25 - width divided 2 plus 160 comma 20 so
12:27 - there we go now a spring Oh I thought we
12:31 - were like we kind of covered everything
12:33 - here but let's let's take a moment to
12:34 - talk about what a spring
12:36 - is so a spring in toxic Libs is a very
12:41 - simple thing to make and the way that we
12:44 - make a
12:45 - spring is by saying new verlet spring
12:50 - there and in this case it's going to be
12:53 - 2D and we have to put four things here
12:57 - we have to put four things here so what
12:59 - is a spring one thing we need is
13:02 - particle number one another thing we
13:05 - need is particle number two so a spring
13:09 - has to connect two particle objects so
13:11 - we pass in those
13:13 - references as the first two as the first
13:16 - two arguments to creating a spring so we
13:18 - make a spring we say spring between
13:19 - particle one and a spring between
13:21 - particle two the
13:23 - third argument is the rest
13:27 - length so what is the rest length what's
13:30 - the length of that spring that it would
13:32 - come to rest at so if we pull it apart
13:34 - it Springs back if we push it in it
13:36 - Springs back so that of course is a
13:38 - float just a number in pixels in pixels
13:41 - we don't have to do any crazy conversion
13:42 - here and that's the third argument and
13:45 - the fourth argument is the strength of
13:47 - the spring and you can think of that as
13:50 - a number between zero and one I really
13:52 - should have thought of this before I
13:54 - began this video but I'm pretty sure if
13:56 - you make that number one it's going to
13:59 - be completely rigid so you you be you
14:02 - basically can't uh it doesn't have any
14:04 - elasticity to it and if you make it zero
14:06 - it's going to be kind of like almost
14:08 - like gum that you could imagine that
14:10 - you're like pulling and it just kind of
14:11 - keeps pulling forever and ever and
14:13 - doesn't really have the strength to
14:14 - power to to kind of spring back so you
14:16 - know you can kind of only do so much to
14:18 - describe these variables the best way as
14:20 - we've seen is just try a lot of
14:22 - different values and see how your system
14:23 - behaves but generally the strength um is
14:25 - a number between zero and one and
14:27 - someday when I realize that's not
14:28 - correct
14:29 - I will fix this video okay so these are
14:31 - the arguments that we need to create the
14:33 - spring and now if we go back and look at
14:35 - this we can see that's exactly what's
14:37 - Happening Here we make a new verlet
14:38 - spring 2D we have two particles 160 and
14:42 - 0.01 so we have kind of not such a
14:45 - strong spring so let's let's actually
14:47 - just try messing with that value a
14:49 - little bit we can see um here I can kind
14:51 - of pull it and it's kind of springy but
14:53 - if I make this value
14:57 - one and I grab grab it like I can't
15:00 - right now it's not even letting me pull
15:01 - it so one makes it a completely perfect
15:03 - rigid body and uh if I make it
15:07 - 0.9 I have to catch it it's very I I
15:11 - can't really pull it either so you can
15:13 - see if I made it uh if I made it zero uh
15:16 - yeah it just completely Falls it has no
15:18 - springiness to pull it back so you can
15:20 - see there's a rain there I was right I
15:21 - was right so um so that's how the that's
15:24 - how the strength of the spring works in
15:26 - uh toxic lips um one thing that should
15:29 - there's two other things I should point
15:30 - out about this particular example number
15:33 - one is whenever you make these things
15:35 - you need to make sure you add them to
15:37 - the physics world so you can make
15:38 - particle objects you can make spring
15:39 - objects if you don't tell toxic Libs
15:41 - they're part of the physics World they
15:43 - won't respond to the physics so you can
15:44 - see here we're adding each particle to
15:46 - the physics world and we're adding each
15:47 - spring to the physics world as we create
15:49 - them another thing that's important to
15:51 - realize is that there's a lock function
15:53 - so you can lock a particle in place so
15:55 - that it can never ever move and that's
15:57 - what's happening here with particle
15:58 - number one particle number one is locked
16:00 - if I were to comment out this line of
16:02 - code and run it again they just fall
16:04 - because they it's not locked in place
16:06 - and they're both responding gravity I
16:07 - can still pick this one up and move it
16:09 - around and you can see um but but you
16:12 - can see here that they're not neither
16:14 - are locked you can lock and unlock
16:15 - things on the Fly that is a very
16:17 - important thing to realize it's not in
16:19 - this example we're just setting it up as
16:20 - either locked or not locked and the last
16:22 - thing I think that's important to
16:23 - mention about this particular example is
16:26 - that you know you've got to make sure
16:28 - you have this update method in draw so
16:30 - this is the equivalent of Box's step
16:32 - function we're only going to update the
16:35 - physics of all the particles and all the
16:36 - Springs if we call update and
16:38 - traditionally we're going to call update
16:40 - once through draw there might be some
16:41 - strange scenarios where you do it in a
16:43 - different way but this is kind of the
16:45 - typical way of doing it okay so this is
16:47 - kind of all the bits and pieces of toxic
16:49 - Libs what I would say to you actually if
16:51 - you're looking for an exercise is try to
16:53 - just come up with a scenario where you
16:55 - put I don't know put all the particles
16:57 - around in a circle and connect them with
16:59 - springs or put them in a line and
17:00 - connect them with springs or put them on
17:01 - a grid and connect them with springs or
17:03 - make 100 random particles with 100
17:05 - random spring connections come up with
17:07 - some arbitrary set of rules that you've
17:10 - designed for yourself to initialize a
17:11 - physics world and then see what happens
17:13 - with that physics world in the next two
17:15 - videos we're going to look at a few
17:16 - examples of that we're going to look at
17:18 - a string a a string of particles
17:20 - connected with springs a grid this idea
17:22 - of a force directed graph we kind of
17:24 - talk through some of these examples as
17:25 - well as look at how we can add
17:26 - attraction repulsion behaviors to these
17:28 - examples as well okay um thank you for
17:32 - listening and I am going to say
17:36 - goodbye
