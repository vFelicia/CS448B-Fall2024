00:00 - and we're back in part two I'm gonna
00:02 - show you my pocket Handbook of
00:03 - algorithms this is one of my favorite
00:05 - books to pull things from because
00:06 - everybody needs their own pocket
00:08 - Handbook of image processing algorithms
00:10 - look it fits in my pocket well hello I
00:13 - have right here in my pocket a handbook
00:15 - of image processing algorithms what's in
00:17 - here that's cool actually I should find
00:19 - a new one to do whoa warping ooh fun we
00:23 - should try that dithering I did a
00:24 - dithering I did the dithering who says
00:27 - that and I'm going to do this dithering
00:29 - more recently I've been using two
00:32 - incredible sources the Arcane algorithm
00:35 - archive which is organized by James
00:37 - schloth it's a compilation a community
00:39 - resource collaborative effort to have
00:43 - every single algorithm documented in
00:45 - every possible programming language I'm
00:47 - looking for something now that maybe I
00:48 - could actually do that I haven't done
00:49 - yet I want to go more in depth but it's
00:51 - going to be in the next one so scroll
00:52 - along and see you soon
