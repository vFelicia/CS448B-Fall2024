00:01 - hello this is me again
00:03 - trying to make a workflow video i've
00:05 - made a bunch of them but i always get
00:06 - lots of questions that are always
00:07 - problems with them
00:08 - so i am now going to make a video that
00:10 - describes my entire workflow even though
00:13 - i have
00:13 - pieces of this in other videos i'm going
00:15 - to do it all in this video
00:17 - you could be watching this video as the
00:19 - as you're just starting to learn to
00:21 - program
00:22 - this isn't the most beginner friendly
00:23 - way to just type your first line of code
00:25 - because i'm going to have a bunch of
00:26 - steps
00:27 - but at some point i will also come back
00:29 - and show you some other
00:30 - uh what editors that you can kind of be
00:32 - up and running uh immediately with
00:34 - so how and by workflow i want to say i
00:37 - want to make a p5.js
00:39 - sketch i don't want to do it in a i mean
00:42 - you
00:42 - you might want to do this i want to do
00:43 - this also but at the moment
00:45 - i don't i want to do this locally on my
00:47 - computer this laptop thing without a
00:48 - cloud-based editor so let me talk about
00:50 - the pieces of the puzzle that i need one
00:53 - thing that you absolutely need
00:56 - oh look at that beautiful is project
00:59 - files
01:01 - now to make a p5.js sketch or really any
01:04 - javascript program
01:06 - web page thing actually all you need is
01:08 - an html file
01:10 - you can write everything you can write
01:12 - all your javascript and everything in
01:13 - there
01:14 - but that's not so convenient it's kind
01:16 - of nicer to just
01:17 - have the html stuff that you need in
01:18 - there um and you need a sketch.js file
01:21 - so you need these project files we could
01:23 - just make these from scratch
01:24 - and type what we need into them but
01:26 - generally we want to get like some sort
01:27 - of template from somewhere so that's one
01:28 - thing we need
01:30 - another thing we need we need a text
01:32 - editor
01:34 - we need something that we can open up
01:36 - these files and by the way we could have
01:38 - more files and project files and css
01:40 - files and image files
01:41 - video files but at a bare minimum this
01:43 - is what we want
01:45 - we need something where we can edit
01:47 - those files
01:48 - you know you could use just about
01:49 - anything use textedit or notepad or
01:51 - anything really i tend to use something
01:53 - called the atom editor
01:56 - uh it is an open source text editor i
01:58 - think put out by
01:59 - github there's also a text editor called
02:02 - sublime text
02:03 - which is quite wonderful there's a free
02:05 - version but
02:07 - it's also a commercial software that you
02:08 - can pay for um
02:10 - there's there's like visual studio
02:11 - people tell me they love
02:13 - and then the list goes on there's lots
02:16 - of them everybody has their own favorite
02:18 - text editor
02:19 - you can say which one is yours in the
02:20 - comments so we need this
02:22 - and then the third thing we need is a
02:26 - server so here's the thing
02:29 - these are the files this is how we write
02:31 - our code in the files
02:32 - how do we what we ultimately want to do
02:34 - is see the result
02:37 - in a web page and it is true that if you
02:39 - just on any computer double-click
02:41 - index.html file it will like pop up and
02:43 - open it in the browser
02:44 - but what you might end up seeing is that
02:46 - it's opening it with this
02:48 - path in the address bar file colon slash
02:52 - and what we want to do is open it with
02:54 - this path
02:55 - http colon slash slash basically we want
02:58 - to make sure
03:00 - that um we are simulating the actual
03:03 - real-world
03:05 - way that someone on the internet would
03:07 - view this webpage
03:08 - which is they would view it served up on
03:10 - a web server so we want to run a little
03:12 - web server
03:12 - on our local computer to be able to look
03:14 - at it in the browser and there are lots
03:16 - of options for that
03:17 - i could run a node server
03:20 - what's node oh my goodness ah i could
03:22 - run a python server
03:24 - what's python oh my goodness i could use
03:26 - like an atom
03:27 - server package right there's all these
03:30 - different
03:31 - possibilities so and i forgot to mention
03:33 - there's lots of ways you could get your
03:34 - project files
03:35 - you could just have a friend of that
03:36 - here so you can say hey do you have any
03:37 - p5 schedules can you email me one
03:39 - and then you can just edit that you just
03:40 - copy paste copy paste like 100 times you
03:42 - have 100 project folders
03:43 - i'm going to use a tool called p5
03:47 - manager
03:48 - it's a little bit of overkill right now
03:50 - because it might be easier just to say
03:51 - hey just download
03:52 - and i'll put a link in this video's
03:54 - description to a zip file where you can
03:55 - just download
03:56 - a blank p5 sketch but i'm going to use
03:59 - this tool called p5 manager which has a
04:01 - little command line
04:02 - thing you can type and it generates the
04:03 - project files for you
04:05 - so i'm going to use p5 manager to
04:08 - generate the project files
04:10 - i'm going to use a text editor to open
04:12 - the project files
04:13 - i'm then going to type my code into the
04:15 - project files i'm
04:17 - going to run a local server and then
04:19 - look at the beauty
04:20 - that is my results does that make sense
04:23 - again i'm trying to make the workflow
04:25 - video to end all workflow that it covers
04:26 - all the pieces i mean there's so much
04:28 - more but this is kind of what i use
04:30 - and i know by the way there's lots of
04:31 - online editors and
04:33 - codepen and glitch and there's a new one
04:36 - coming out from p5.js
04:37 - soon so there's so many possibilities
04:39 - but this is this is a way of working
04:42 - just one just one all right so now here
04:45 - we go
04:46 - how do i how do i use this p5 manager
04:48 - thing well first of all
04:49 - you have to be a little if you're on a
04:51 - mac uh you've got to feel a little
04:52 - comfortable using terminal
04:54 - if you're on windows
04:58 - somebody in the chat tell me what you do
04:59 - on windows
05:01 - so you've got to run this piece of
05:03 - software called terminal it's usually in
05:04 - applications utilities
05:06 - and it looks something like this
05:09 - then you could just magically type p5
05:12 - generate
05:13 - dash be my project no no you can't so
05:16 - here's the thing this is the command
05:17 - that i type
05:18 - what this command's meet means is hey
05:20 - generate a p5 project i want it to be a
05:22 - bundle
05:23 - i can talk about what that is and i want
05:25 - it to be called my project the thing is
05:27 - i'm gonna i'm gonna just pretend there's
05:28 - something called uh
05:30 - x5 you're gonna see this
05:33 - x5 p5 command not found when i do this
05:37 - it's actually going to work whoops
05:40 - ignore that p5 generate
05:43 - dash b my project this is actually going
05:45 - to work when i do it
05:46 - because i've installed p5 manager
05:48 - already and you can see what this did
05:50 - it created a folder called my project
05:52 - and it gave me sketch.js index.html and
05:54 - by the way i kind of forgot something
05:56 - important now i'm realizing is i also
05:58 - need
05:58 - all those library files you actually
06:02 - don't need the library files locally
06:04 - because index.html can like point out
06:07 - to a url to get the p5 libraries
06:10 - and you'll see that in a lot of uh
06:12 - examples and things but i
06:14 - but the p5 manager will actually give
06:15 - you those library files locally
06:17 - all right here we go now okay so how are
06:20 - you gonna how do you install this p5
06:21 - manager one thing is i do have a video
06:24 - where i go through how to install this
06:26 - in more detail
06:27 - but i'm gonna do it here anyway but you
06:29 - can i'll link to that p5 manager video
06:31 - as well
06:31 - so the thing that i need is a piece of
06:34 - software called node
06:35 - and node is a javascript runtime
06:38 - built on chrome v8 javascript engine
06:40 - blah blah blah blah it's a thing that
06:42 - lets you run javascript programs on your
06:43 - computer and on servers and lots of
06:45 - other places
06:46 - so you're going to want to download this
06:47 - and install it and you'll know that it's
06:49 - working
06:50 - one of the things you can type by the
06:51 - way in terminal is clear then it'll
06:52 - clear everything
06:53 - you'll know that it's working if you
06:55 - just type node and you get
06:57 - that there so pause this video install
06:59 - node go back to your terminal type in
07:00 - node see if you get this
07:02 - and you can do things like five plus
07:04 - seven
07:05 - and it gives you twelve so you can run a
07:06 - little javascript and i'm gonna hit ctrl
07:08 - c
07:08 - and to exit again press ctrl c again i'm
07:10 - gonna hit clear
07:13 - so once you have node installed you need
07:16 - to
07:17 - use something called npm you've already
07:19 - got it installed
07:20 - and to install the p5 manager you have
07:22 - to say npm
07:24 - install p5 manager now here's the thing
07:28 - you also want to say dash g
07:31 - what this means is i want to install
07:34 - this thing called p5 manager
07:36 - as a global thing for my computer i want
07:38 - to be able to always type p5 manager
07:40 - wherever i am
07:41 - i'm going to hit enter it might have a
07:43 - problem
07:44 - it might i've already installed it but
07:46 - i'm going to let it kind of go
07:47 - anyway
07:52 - and i got an error so here's the problem
07:56 - i forgot that in order to install
07:58 - something globally on my computer
08:00 - i have to say sudo
08:04 - okay what am i doing by the way the up
08:07 - arrow the up arrow allows you to scroll
08:10 - through
08:11 - previous commands so i can go back and
08:13 - find
08:14 - this command and i'm going to now say
08:16 - sudo which stands for super user do
08:19 - which will give me the permission to
08:20 - install it
08:24 - i'd have to type in my password
08:28 - i don't know what my password is
08:33 - there we go right now
08:39 - i think i'm not having like i did the
08:41 - same shtick in a different video so it's
08:43 - installed
08:43 - so that's great i'm gonna hit clear and
08:46 - now i can
08:47 - so here's the thing i can now use that
08:48 - p5 command
08:51 - and look it's telling me i'm running p5
08:52 - manager 0.3.2 i don't know why the color
08:55 - became all weird here i like selected
08:57 - something
08:57 - i don't know what's going on but i'm
08:58 - going to just pretend that's not
08:59 - happening now here's the thing
09:01 - where do i want to make my project well
09:03 - let's say i just want to put the project
09:04 - on the desktop here's a command that's
09:06 - useful for you
09:07 - pwd print working directory
09:12 - and you can see this is the director i'm
09:14 - in user slash processing my username is
09:16 - processing on this particular login
09:19 - should probably be coding train or
09:20 - whatever but now i can say
09:22 - cd for change directory like maybe i
09:25 - just want to go to the desktop
09:27 - so now if i say pwd
09:31 - here we go and guess what let's say i
09:33 - actually want to go to some weird folder
09:34 - on my computer
09:36 - if i go and say like oh there's this
09:38 - like coding train folder as frogger2
09:41 - and i want to put something in there i
09:43 - can actually just
09:44 - drag the folder into here
09:48 - let go and that's the whole path users
09:50 - processing documents old desktop pcd
09:53 - coding train frogger2 so i don't need
09:55 - anything to do that right now and hit
09:56 - control c
09:57 - and i'm just going to say clear i'm
09:59 - going to say pwd i'm on the desktop and
10:01 - now i'm going to say p5
10:02 - generate dash b b stands for bundle
10:06 - p5 will actually generate you this whole
10:08 - like file system management for a lot
10:10 - the p5 manager for
10:12 - a lot of different sketches i personally
10:14 - just like to generate one sketch at a
10:16 - time
10:16 - so that's what dash b does dash b um
10:20 - coding train one so here we go
10:24 - hit enter it created all those things
10:26 - and now
10:27 - just to be sure i'm gonna minimize all
10:29 - my windows and look at this
10:31 - on my desktop is this folder called
10:34 - codingtrain1
10:35 - and it now has index.html
10:39 - sketch.js and all the library files that
10:41 - i need
10:42 - step one is done again just
10:46 - one way to do that you just need these
10:48 - files you can make them from scratch you
10:49 - can download them somewhere you can copy
10:50 - them from a previous project
10:52 - but step one is done using p5 manager
10:54 - now i need step two
10:56 - so again so many different possible text
10:59 - editors
11:00 - let's use the adam editor so
11:03 - the atom software is a piece of software
11:06 - you can get by going to
11:07 - atom.io and you can do download for
11:10 - whatever your operating system is here
11:12 - you can see this is kind of what it
11:13 - looks like it is a text editor
11:15 - hooray i already have adam installed so
11:18 - i'm going to go down here
11:20 - and uh i'm just going to use the search
11:22 - bar to type in adam
11:24 - so i'm going to run the adam application
11:26 - open it
11:27 - and you can see it's just opening this
11:29 - blank page you'll probably see some like
11:31 - welcome messages and stuff but i've used
11:33 - it quite a few times
11:34 - so it's just opening something blank and
11:36 - then i can do
11:37 - file open i can go to the desktop
11:40 - and i can just select this coding train
11:43 - folder
11:44 - and i can press open and then boom we
11:46 - can see here in the left pane
11:48 - these are my files and this is blank and
11:51 - i can click on sketch
11:52 - and i have the code ready to go so if i
11:55 - add something like
11:56 - background zero and let's make it uh
12:00 - like a green color
12:01 - just to be sure this is working all
12:03 - right i've added some code
12:04 - now i
12:08 - am going to do what i'm going to just
12:10 - i'm going to
12:11 - throw caution to the wind and i'm going
12:14 - to
12:14 - don't do this don't try this at home
12:16 - double-click this index.html file
12:19 - and it worked so this is okay it's it's
12:22 - a very bad habit please
12:24 - please please oh it's making me so
12:26 - uncomfortable and it's all green and
12:27 - bright
12:28 - but you can see here this is what i'm
12:30 - trying to avoid it opened the html page
12:33 - via the file system and
12:34 - while just drawing a green background it
12:36 - had no problem with that
12:38 - there are many other areas
12:41 - where you can have a problem so what i
12:44 - really want to do is run a local server
12:46 - now
12:47 - we're now done with step two
12:50 - so now i need to go to step
12:54 - three what local server should i run
12:58 - i have a video i made a long time ago or
13:00 - i ran a python server i think i used a
13:02 - node server and another one i think i
13:03 - might have used the atom live server
13:05 - package i don't know which to use
13:07 - ah you know what the p5 manager comes
13:09 - with its own server
13:11 - in fact i think i'll just show you a
13:12 - bunch so so
13:14 - one thing i can do i got to open
13:15 - terminal back up one thing i can do
13:18 - is first of all i want to be in the
13:20 - directory of my sketch or in a directory
13:22 - above actually it would be fine
13:24 - let's just run the i don't know let's
13:26 - change into the directory
13:28 - i'm going to do this i'm going to hit
13:30 - clear again
13:31 - so i could type some commands to run a
13:34 - local server
13:35 - for example this is a command if you
13:37 - have python installed on your computer
13:39 - which a mac will and i'm probably easy
13:41 - to download install python and a pc
13:44 - that is now running a local server and
13:47 - if i go
13:48 - to the browser and type in
13:51 - localhost colon8000 localhost meaning
13:54 - like i want to connect to google.com or
13:57 - yahoo.com but instead of that web server
14:00 - somewhere off in the internet
14:02 - i want to connect to localhost the web
14:04 - server running on this laptop right here
14:06 - and 8000 is a port so when you connect
14:08 - to a web page it's usually on the
14:10 - default port 80 and you don't specify it
14:13 - but this local server it told me right
14:15 - here
14:17 - it's running it on port 8000 so that's
14:19 - why i knew to type 8000.
14:21 - there is another node package i could
14:23 - install uh
14:24 - sudo npm install g http
14:28 - server i think that's what it's called
14:30 - dot server
14:31 - dash server
14:35 - so i could install this node package i
14:38 - already probably did and then i could
14:39 - say
14:39 - http server and now it's running a
14:42 - server there it is
14:44 - 8080. there it is it's running a server
14:47 - 8080 and you can see this is my local ip
14:48 - address
14:49 - so now i could take go there and put
14:51 - this
14:52 - and i'm running the sketch oh so many
14:55 - things
14:56 - another thing that i could do is a lot
14:58 - of these text editors
15:00 - will come with a special plugin or by
15:02 - default of a menu option which says like
15:04 - preview
15:05 - run live server that type of thing
15:08 - brackets is one that i did a previous
15:09 - video on
15:11 - that has a little button that you press
15:13 - which is for a live preview and it runs
15:14 - a server
15:15 - so adam one of the things you could do
15:16 - with adam
15:18 - is you can under here there's packages
15:20 - now you'll see i already have
15:23 - dev lot no no actually i don't have it
15:27 - so i don't have so this is perfect so
15:29 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to see
15:30 - can i install
15:31 - a live server package with adam so
15:34 - packages oh so adam i want to go to
15:36 - uh preferences you start if you see what
15:38 - i'm doing i'm going to preferences
15:41 - and then i want to go to install which
15:44 - is right here
15:45 - install and then i want to look for
15:49 - i'm going to search for live server
15:53 - dev live reload oh maybe that's what oh
15:55 - no adam so
15:56 - this is something that i've installed
15:58 - dev live reload maybe that does
16:00 - the trick too adam live server is what i
16:02 - was thinking of
16:03 - so i'm going to click install okay it
16:06 - installed because i know that because
16:07 - now it says uninstall or disable
16:10 - uh packages now i have i have that
16:11 - installed i can just go to atom live
16:13 - server
16:13 - start server there are keyboard
16:15 - shortcuts to automatically launch it but
16:17 - i'm going to launch it here
16:19 - and boom there it is and there there's
16:21 - another local server at this address
16:23 - and that port and what's interesting
16:24 - about this now is look
16:26 - at the green color i'm just going to go
16:28 - to my code and i'm going to
16:29 - add this color i'm going to hit save and
16:32 - then i'm going to alt tab to the browser
16:33 - it's
16:34 - live reload so as i change the code like
16:37 - okay well actually i just wanted a 600
16:38 - by 400 canvas
16:40 - and i want to have like a random
16:42 - something i don't know
16:44 - you can see it's continuously reloading
16:46 - the page for me which is wonderful
16:48 - so okay to recap all the pieces that i'm
16:51 - using
16:52 - are i'm getting my project files
16:56 - from p5 manager which is a node module
16:58 - so i need to download and install node
17:00 - so i can write some terminal commands
17:01 - with node
17:03 - i am using a text editor i happen to be
17:06 - using atom
17:07 - but any text editor will do then i want
17:09 - to view the results of my code in the
17:11 - web browser so i need to run a
17:13 - server now someday you might watch a
17:15 - video where i explain how to program
17:17 - your own server
17:18 - for all sorts of interesting things and
17:19 - i'll link to those videos as well you
17:21 - can write your own node server but you
17:22 - can use a built-in node server
17:24 - you can use a built-in python server if
17:26 - you have python you could look for a
17:28 - plugin for your text editor
17:30 - i'm sure the comments of this video will
17:32 - be filled with lots of other suggestions
17:34 - of how to run your own server so here's
17:37 - something really important
17:38 - something that you might notice in a lot
17:40 - of my examples is i have this
17:42 - other pane open in the browser where i
17:45 - can see error messages or i can do
17:47 - console log statements and the way i'm
17:49 - doing that in chrome it's different in
17:51 - different browsers it's under view
17:54 - developer javascript console
17:58 - so if i click that the javascript
18:00 - console it now
18:01 - pops up over here and you can see adam
18:04 - is even talking to it because it's
18:05 - saying hey
18:05 - i've got the live reload enabled
18:09 - so one thing the couple important points
18:12 - about this
18:12 - number one is it might not appear there
18:15 - for you
18:15 - it might be on the bottom you can pop it
18:17 - out you can kind of control
18:19 - where it goes you can you can look right
18:22 - here and you can see oh i could put it
18:23 - on the bottom or i could pop it out so
18:24 - that's one important thing
18:26 - another really key thing and depending
18:29 - on what the server using is but i like
18:31 - to keep something checked if i go here
18:33 - under
18:33 - settings and i scroll all the way down
18:36 - to
18:37 - network this is a pretty important
18:39 - setting
18:40 - disable cache while dev tools are open
18:43 - this is a setting you want to have
18:45 - checked
18:48 - because sometimes browsers they really
18:49 - like to remember something like say you
18:51 - know what uh you're asking me to do
18:52 - something i already
18:53 - you asked me to do this a while ago i'm
18:54 - just going to do it you asked me a while
18:55 - ago because it's faster
18:57 - but if you're changing your if you're
18:58 - changing your code a lot you don't want
18:59 - it to by accident run your old code
19:02 - so this will disable its ability from
19:04 - caching some previous version of your
19:06 - code and running that instead
19:07 - whenever these javascript console is
19:09 - open so if you have that set
19:11 - you will never have that problem and i
19:13 - can just go and i wasn't having that
19:14 - problem because the live reload is
19:16 - probably
19:17 - you know i can change all these colors
19:19 - and it's it's changing my code but
19:20 - that's
19:21 - an important sort of detail there other
19:23 - question that i'm sure a lot of you are
19:24 - asking
19:25 - is if you're using windows what do you
19:27 - use but
19:28 - as the equivalent of this terminal
19:30 - application so there is just the command
19:32 - prop
19:32 - on windows there are also some i'm
19:34 - reading the chat here some things that
19:36 - you can install
19:36 - like cygwin uh c-y-g-w-i-n
19:40 - there are some other tools like you can
19:43 - install the linux
19:44 - file system maybe in windows 10 it
19:46 - actually does this for you
19:47 - i have no idea i'm lost so if somebody
19:50 - writes a helpful comment
19:51 - about the what to do for your terminal
19:53 - and windows i will pin that comment
19:55 - uh to the top of this video's page so
19:57 - maybe look for there and see if that's
19:58 - there
19:58 - the chat is telling me that git bash is
20:01 - also an excellent tool for windows it's
20:03 - actually one that i've used before so
20:04 - you can download something called git
20:05 - bash i will include a link to that as
20:07 - well in this video's
20:08 - description all right i think i've
20:10 - covered everything
20:12 - just to just to like i think i feel like
20:14 - i should do a whole video just on the
20:16 - console alone
20:17 - but so maybe i'll do that but just to
20:19 - like at least put something in there
20:21 - i can do stuff like console.log you know
20:24 - mousex
20:25 - if i put that into my code what i'm
20:28 - gonna see is
20:29 - i'm gonna be able to debug the value of
20:30 - the mouse as i'm running it and if i
20:32 - have some kind of error
20:34 - like i misspell background and don't put
20:37 - the d on the end
20:38 - you can see uncaught reference error
20:40 - background is not defined so this is
20:42 - where i
20:42 - say sketch.js line number six so i can
20:45 - go back
20:46 - and see uh line number six that's where
20:48 - my error is so
20:49 - that javascript console is really a
20:52 - useful tool to get used to using and
20:54 - practice using so
20:55 - i hope this video didn't end up being
20:56 - super long and i hope that you found it
20:58 - helpful
20:59 - and i'm sure i'll end up remaking this
21:01 - again because workflows and tools and
21:03 - technologies
21:03 - just change constantly and thanks very
21:05 - much for watching
21:19 - you
