00:05 - hello again okay so we're going to begin
00:08 - now so before we kind of get into the
00:11 - real kind of meat of the material um
00:14 - we're going to do I'm going to do a few
00:17 - videos I'm just kind of going to get us
00:18 - back and used to programming it
00:20 - processing and where are we what's going
00:22 - on
00:22 - I left the fluorescent lights on turn
00:25 - those off and just to get us kind of
00:29 - going here so what I want to start with
00:32 - is actually a simple example the first
00:37 - half of this whole video series is going
00:39 - to be about programming a physics engine
00:41 - toy it's really loud at the hall play
00:43 - quiet down there okay um but so before
00:50 - we we're going to formalize our
00:52 - understanding of motion we're going to
00:53 - look at vectors we look at forces but to
00:56 - even give us a place to start I think
00:58 - something we could look at would be a
01:00 - random walker so I'm going to move over
01:01 - here for a second and so here we go here
01:04 - is a very simple processing program with
01:07 - a random bar it's been running for maybe
01:09 - about 15 minutes now we could kind of
01:11 - find the little a little friend
01:14 - somewhere in here do you see where is oh
01:17 - there is is down I don't know if - he or
01:19 - she but it's down here somewhere kind of
01:21 - moving around randomly walking so what's
01:24 - going on here we have a program that
01:27 - clearly has a variable called X and it
01:34 - has a variable called Y those variables
01:38 - are storing the XY location of this
01:40 - little dot that's moving around the
01:42 - screen and you can imagine somewhere in
01:44 - the program we're saying hey draw an
01:47 - ellipse or maybe it's a point maybe it's
01:50 - a line whatever it is I'm going to say
01:51 - ellipse right now I maybe it's a tiny
01:53 - one at that location the two pixel by
01:57 - two pixel wide location we're drawing
01:58 - that circle so what is it about this
02:03 - example that is the reason why we're
02:05 - talking about it well somewhere else in
02:08 - the code right if we if this works our
02:09 - code first of all
02:10 - X&Y of no additional value but let's say
02:12 - they got initialized let's say we're
02:14 - doing this ellipse and draw over and
02:16 - over again we just have this little tiny
02:17 - circle static on the screen in one place
02:19 - never moving but it's not it's this
02:23 - little dot it's moving we zoomed in we
02:25 - saw it move it's moving why because
02:27 - somewhere else in the program are
02:29 - written these lines of code x equals x
02:32 - plus something y equals y plus something
02:40 - some thing and by the way this something
02:46 - question mark this is the question we
02:49 - want to answer in video after video an
02:51 - example after example over this entire
02:53 - series every program we're going to look
02:55 - at was more and more sophisticated
02:57 - motion really just comes down to putting
02:59 - more and more interesting stuff in here
03:01 - how do we change that object's location
03:03 - over time well so the other thing about
03:07 - this that I've written here is we have
03:08 - we have an organizational structure that
03:10 - we need to live by in these examples
03:12 - it's object oriented program now let's
03:15 - try to remember something about
03:16 - processing first for a second so if you
03:19 - recall processing has these two fumbling
03:22 - word every time and you first started
03:24 - learning and write your first processing
03:25 - sketch you're always there right ok here
03:27 - we go void I don't know void means it's
03:29 - very weird of course now hopefully you
03:31 - do void set up curly bracket open close
03:34 - curly bracket void draw curly bracket
03:39 - open close curly bracket this is this is
03:43 - something that you're probably hopefully
03:44 - very very used to if you have a dead
03:46 - prostitute happens the beginning gets
03:50 - triggered it's setup draw happens over
03:53 - and over again this is our main
03:54 - animation loop if we move something draw
03:56 - something blue something draw something
03:57 - we see it moving on the screen so
03:59 - traditionally speaking these variables
04:02 - might be declared at the top I'm going
04:04 - to initialize them in setup we might do
04:05 - this and draw we might do this in draw
04:07 - and that would be our program however we
04:11 - need to live in an object-oriented world
04:12 - we don't need to you so do you do any of
04:15 - this you could really just shut this up
04:16 - right now but if you want to follow me
04:18 - along here my examples be
04:20 - examples they're going to be
04:21 - object-oriented it makes a lot of sense
04:23 - for them to add Victoria to we want to
04:24 - think of the things that move around her
04:26 - screen as an object so we want to create
04:32 - this object let's call it a Walker we're
04:37 - going to declare that as a variable that
04:38 - native the variable of W the type is
04:40 - Walker Walker is going to be a new
04:45 - Walker object and then that's what we do
04:48 - at the beginning we set up our object
04:49 - and then a draw
04:51 - maybe we call like a function called
04:52 - walk and maybe we call a function called
04:55 - display what does that mean this is the
04:59 - structure we want to have that we're
05:00 - going to have we're going to be
05:02 - declaring objects initializing objects
05:05 - and using those objects over and over
05:06 - again in draw now where do these where's
05:09 - all this stuff match up to well if we're
05:12 - going to have an object of type Walker
05:13 - we have to declare a class of type
05:17 - Walker Texas Ranger and those curly
05:22 - brackets go all the way around each
05:24 - Walker has its own x and y each Walker
05:27 - perhaps has a function well I guess I
05:29 - called it walk called walk each Walker
05:35 - perhaps has a function called display so
05:39 - we can see here object-oriented
05:41 - programming what is it it's data and
05:43 - functionality together a walker is a
05:45 - thing that has a location what else is a
05:48 - walker it's a thing that can move that
05:49 - location it's a thing that can display
05:51 - itself in that location that's what
05:53 - we're describing here we forgot that
05:54 - here we need to have a constructor right
05:57 - the constructor is the objects method
06:00 - where that constructs the object work
06:02 - where all of its goods kind of like the
06:04 - objects set up in a way is a set up
06:07 - which is where you do all the stuff that
06:08 - happens at the beginning of the process
06:09 - we sketch an object's constructor is its
06:12 - own set up it's all the stuff that
06:14 - happens when you first make that object
06:16 - okay it was just really good exciting
06:18 - and nobody could believe what they're
06:19 - watching this amazing compelling video
06:22 - oh well this is our life you know here
06:25 - we are drawing things about constructors
06:27 - ok so this is the structure we want to
06:31 - get used to but what are we doing we're
06:33 - doing
06:33 - a random walker what is a random walker
06:36 - well let's go back and look at our
06:38 - little random Walker here again press
06:42 - that button again Here I am and let's
06:44 - zoom in on him him I don't keep calling
06:46 - me him I'd like to keep I want to redo
06:50 - this video just to be less gender
06:51 - specific um you can't really see it over
06:54 - there but but this this Walker is a
06:56 - traditional I would say severe tradition
06:59 - he can't stop it this random Walker is a
07:02 - very traditional random Walker we want
07:06 - to race on this but it's too late so oh
07:09 - and I'm you can't see me erasing it I
07:11 - got to get better practice it is that
07:12 - there we go I'm over here now
07:14 - oh I've also made this video 7 minutes
07:17 - it's too long up which I do it again I'm
07:20 - just going to keep going I'm probably
07:21 - going to redo this video later ok so
07:25 - here is an X Y location the traditional
07:29 - random Walker sort of basic first
07:31 - example you could say there are only
07:32 - four options move up move to the right
07:35 - move to the left or move down meaning
07:38 - we're saying ah this is one option this
07:42 - is another option this is another option
07:46 - and this is another option either X
07:49 - changes by 1 or negative 1 or Y to 9 1
07:51 - or negative 1 4 options each with an
07:54 - equal probability 25% 25% 25% Furguson
07:58 - let's go see how that's implemented in
07:59 - the code now i zoom back out and if I
08:04 - open this up I've got the code and we
08:06 - can see here look this is exactly what
08:08 - we talked about a walker object a new
08:10 - walker object Walker steps and Walker
08:13 - draws over there I said walk and display
08:17 - now I'm saying step and rendered I'm
08:21 - sprinting your code ok so now if I go
08:23 - over here to Walker we can see AHA the
08:27 - Walker has two of X&Y it's initializing
08:29 - the middle screen the render function
08:30 - draws it as a point and now look at this
08:34 - we're using the random function and
08:36 - processing to choose one of four options
08:38 - x + + x
08:41 - - why + + or why - - we're keeping the
08:43 - Walker on the screen this is your first
08:47 - exercise create a random Walker and have
08:50 - it do something slightly different is it
08:52 - purely random is it based on probability
08:54 - is it using Perlin noise does it like to
08:56 - move to the left does it like to go with
08:58 - spiral patterns what kind of motion can
09:00 - you do just with this object-oriented
09:02 - structure take this code mess with it
09:04 - just work on the step function and see
09:05 - what you can make in the next videos
09:07 - we're going to look at techniques in
09:08 - probability and techniques in Perlin
09:11 - noise we're going to see how those might
09:12 - apply at this random Walker with that
09:16 - this is the scene finish done oh I need
09:20 - a button that stops recording I have to
09:21 - go over here it's very awkward you're
09:23 - watching the end of this for no reason
09:24 - and click the mouse code
