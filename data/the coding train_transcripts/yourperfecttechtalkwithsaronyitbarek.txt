00:00 - hello welcome to a special guest
00:03 - presentation episode thing of the coding
00:06 - train so this is special episode uh it
00:08 - actually is an archive of a live stream
00:10 - I'm recording this introduction after
00:12 - that happened because I had a bit of
00:13 - some sound problems during the actual
00:15 - live introduction you didn't miss
00:17 - anything trust me um but I'm really
00:19 - excited I'm always um happy when I have
00:21 - a guest uh to with a diff different
00:23 - voice different point of view to uh talk
00:25 - to you about something interesting and
00:27 - meaningful um and so today I'm very
00:28 - pleased to introduce to you San yarak um
00:31 - siron uh I met first when I think I was
00:34 - a guest on her amazing uh podcast called
00:37 - code newbies is it code newbies or Cod
00:39 - newbie code newbie sorry code newbie um
00:43 - so code newbie is um I I really
00:45 - recommend the podcast there's you know
00:47 - it's been how many years now uh over two
00:50 - over two years there's tons of episodes
00:51 - to go back listen them all the thing
00:53 - that I like the most about it is there
00:55 - are so many different stories of
00:58 - people's Journeys through learning to
00:59 - code discovering to code and I think if
01:01 - you picture in your head what you think
01:02 - a programmer is and then you listen to
01:04 - the code newbie podcast you're going to
01:05 - have a different picture after you
01:07 - listen to a lot of episodes so I I
01:08 - really would recommend that podcast um
01:10 - Saran is also uh organizing a conference
01:13 - uh April 20th 21 and22 um in New York
01:18 - City it's called codeland oh it's right
01:19 - behind me oh my God it's right behind me
01:21 - April 21 and 22 um this is the URL and
01:24 - so there's still tickets available and
01:26 - so what I asked her to present about or
01:28 - the idea that she had was was you know
01:30 - what is it what how do you put together
01:32 - a tech talk you're presenting at a
01:33 - conference you're presenting at uh a
01:36 - lunch at work or whatever it might be
01:37 - what are some ways to think about
01:39 - putting together a tech talk and I know
01:40 - that I struggle with this all the time
01:42 - and I want pasting slides together so
01:44 - anyway I'm I'm talking too much um enjoy
01:47 - this uh presentation there is a small
01:49 - sound glitch during the presentation
01:51 - it's just about 4 seconds long but
01:52 - hopefully it won't affect your enjoyment
01:55 - of it at the end I answer some questions
01:56 - from the audience and then if you also
01:58 - have questions you can ask on Twitter uh
02:01 - you can ask San or me on Twitter check
02:02 - this video's description and of course
02:04 - you can ask in the comments below okay
02:05 - thanks and now I'm going to travel
02:07 - backwards in time for San's
02:10 - presentation hi everybody my name is San
02:12 - I'm super excited to be here uh this is
02:14 - my first live stream YouTube thingy uh
02:18 - so let's both cross our fingers and hope
02:20 - this works out so as Dan mentioned today
02:22 - we're going to talk about your perfect
02:24 - Tech talk and just to give you a little
02:25 - bit of context about me I'm siron I'm
02:27 - the founder of code newbie we are the
02:29 - most supportive community of programmers
02:32 - and people learning to code we do a
02:33 - Twitter chat every Wednesday we have a
02:35 - weekly podcast every Monday uh we have a
02:37 - a slack group I think we've reached
02:38 - 9,000 members so far uh we're all over
02:41 - the world we're really excited to code
02:43 - and one of the things that I'm super
02:45 - super pumped about is a conference that
02:46 - we're doing it's our first conference
02:48 - and I talk a lot as the screen says I do
02:51 - a lot of speaking um I've done Keynotes
02:53 - I've spoken all over the world and my
02:55 - favorite part about putting this cand
02:57 - conference together is getting to work
02:59 - with other speakers a lot of firsttime
03:00 - speakers and helping them put their talk
03:02 - together and really craft it so as I've
03:04 - worked with I think we have about 30
03:07 - speakers uh I've come up with some
03:09 - really good patterns some ideas that I
03:11 - think will help you so that's what we're
03:12 - going to dig into
03:13 - today so if we think about the different
03:15 - stages of putting a talk together there
03:17 - are four parts there's the ideas and the
03:20 - brainstorming there's the content the
03:22 - structure and the delivery we're not
03:24 - going to talk about delivery because
03:25 - that gets
03:30 - before we dig into these individual
03:31 - Parts it's super important that we
03:33 - Define what a tech talk is now you're
03:36 - thinking s obviously this is a talk
03:38 - about tech things sort of right I think
03:41 - the more helpful way to define a tech
03:43 - talk is to talk about what it is not so
03:45 - what isn't a tech talk it is not a
03:47 - lecture can you remember being in
03:50 - college or being in school and actually
03:51 - enjoying your professor's lecture of
03:53 - course you don't it was boring you
03:54 - probably skipped a lot of them it is not
03:56 - a lecture do not bore your audience
03:58 - number two it is not a soap box I see
04:00 - this all the time where speakers use the
04:02 - opportunity to have a mic in a stage to
04:05 - rant and vent about the latest
04:07 - JavaScript framework that's pissing them
04:08 - off let's not do this and it is not a
04:11 - blog post if you think about a blog post
04:13 - it's a lot of content it's very maybe
04:17 - there's some pictures maybe there's some
04:18 - videos but you don't really get to
04:19 - emotionally interact with the blog post
04:22 - it's a lot of content that is usually
04:24 - very useful uh but there's no human
04:26 - element to it if I watch your talk and I
04:28 - think to myself I could have just gotten
04:30 - this from reading a post it's probably
04:32 - not a great Tech talk so what is a tech
04:35 - talk a tech talk is a performance you
04:38 - have a stage you literally have a stage
04:40 - you have a mic you have an audience this
04:42 - is more theater than it is anything else
04:45 - it should also be informative that's the
04:47 - the tech part of the talk right sharing
04:49 - people your technical knowledge your
04:51 - maybe some opinions uh maybe some
04:53 - expertise if you feel like you have some
04:56 - and a tech talk is emotional and this is
04:58 - one of the things that I really learned
05:01 - from watching a lot of other talks and
05:03 - thinking about the ones that stuck with
05:04 - me that I I literally play back over and
05:07 - over again in my head to this day
05:08 - they're the ones that didn't just tell
05:10 - me information or give me a timeline or
05:13 - throw some tech terms at me these are
05:15 - the ones that said wow I felt this way I
05:17 - really struggled through this I was
05:19 - really excited about this and that
05:21 - emotional connection optimizing for the
05:23 - fact that you were a real person
05:25 - physically there with your audience is
05:27 - huge so now that we've gotten all of
05:30 - that out of the way let's talk about
05:31 - phase one the
05:32 - idea ideas are super super hard and
05:35 - they're even harder if you're a beginner
05:37 - because you generally think well I don't
05:38 - have an original idea I don't have
05:40 - anything that I feel like I need to
05:42 - share with anyone and they're hard if
05:44 - you're a first-time speaker because even
05:46 - if you've been coding for a million
05:47 - years and you're the CTO of this and
05:49 - that you may feel like well I still
05:51 - don't have an original idea because it's
05:53 - already been written about it's already
05:54 - been talked about and the other thing
05:56 - that makes speaking and idea generation
05:58 - really hard is that a lot of times we
06:01 - assume speakers are experts and I think
06:03 - that's kind of a problem we don't want
06:05 - to view speakers as experts we want to
06:06 - view them as storytellers and we'll get
06:08 - into stories a little bit
06:09 - later so when I try to think about the
06:12 - ideas that I want to share and put into
06:14 - a talk I ask myself a couple questions
06:16 - that really help out one is what is
06:19 - something that I'm proud of what's
06:21 - something that I've done no matter how
06:22 - small it is or how big it is that I can
06:23 - look back on and go yeah I did that next
06:27 - I think about what have I learned every
06:29 - time I learned something I usually call
06:30 - my mom and tell her this new tech thing
06:32 - that I solved she has no idea what I'm
06:34 - saying but that's okay she pretends
06:35 - that's why she's awesome but what is
06:37 - something that you've learned and you
06:39 - were excited about it enough to share it
06:41 - with a friend a significant other a
06:43 - coworker and the third thing is what's a
06:45 - project that you've struggled with the
06:47 - thing that I find so interesting about
06:49 - tech talks is we view it as a platform
06:52 - for expertise but some of the most
06:54 - popular talks are really about failure
06:56 - one of my favorite Talks by uh oh I name
06:59 - I think it's Jacob Kaplan Moss I hope
07:01 - that's correct uh who helped open source
07:04 - Jango is he did a talk I think it was
07:06 - something like I am not a good developer
07:08 - that was the whole thing it got
07:09 - thousands of views on YouTube because he
07:11 - spent 20 minutes talking about how much
07:13 - he sucked so talking about your
07:15 - struggles and your failures can actually
07:16 - be very very powerful and if you're a
07:18 - beginner if you don't feel like you have
07:19 - a lot of expertise that can be a really
07:21 - great idea source for you so you may
07:24 - notice that these three things what
07:26 - you're proud of what you learned what
07:27 - you struggled with have one thing in
07:29 - common it's about
07:31 - you which gets to the real source of
07:34 - this what is something that only you can
07:37 - tell me about I want you to keep that in
07:39 - the back of your
07:40 - mind so everything we've talked about so
07:43 - far is super theoretical it's all very
07:44 - high level and everything is wonderful
07:46 - and easy when it seems you know
07:48 - theoretical we don't have a real example
07:50 - so we're going to dig into an example um
07:54 - and I I really just want to warn you for
07:55 - this part this is uh this is really
07:57 - exciting so if you're not sitting down
07:59 - you may want to take a seat for what I'm
08:00 - about to show
08:02 - you this is the cookie dough ice cream
08:05 - cone no it is not cookie dough ice cream
08:08 - it is just cookie dough there is a store
08:11 - I believe it's in New York City that
08:13 - sells different flavors of cookie dough
08:16 - it's like it's safe to eat and all that
08:17 - stuff and you just scoop a whole thing
08:19 - of cookie dough and you put it in a cone
08:21 - and you eat it that's amazing this is
08:23 - also known as happiness that that was me
08:25 - I I I decided to just call it happiness
08:28 - and if we look at this awesome video can
08:29 - I play this video I can't play it it's
08:31 - okay it's just someone scooping uh
08:33 - cookie dough thing it's fine uh and if
08:35 - we look here we can see that it comes in
08:39 - different flavors there's even a Nutella
08:41 - flavored cookie dough ice cream cone
08:43 - it's magical so you as a very amazing
08:48 - developer you know real problem solver
08:50 - you hear about this cookie dough ice
08:52 - cream cone and you think yourself the
08:54 - world really needs a map they need a map
08:56 - to find out where are all the places
08:58 - where they can find this cookie dough
09:00 - ice cream cone so you decide to do a
09:04 - little data visualization project you
09:07 - decide that you're going to make a
09:07 - really cool map and you're going to use
09:10 - something called leaflet which is a
09:11 - JavaScript library to make interactive
09:12 - maps and you realize that it's a very
09:15 - simple map because there's only one
09:17 - store and only one data point but you've
09:19 - never used Lea flip before you're super
09:21 - excited about your first interactive map
09:23 - and you want to talk about it so the
09:26 - idea that we're working with is how to
09:29 - map cookie dough ice cream cones that's
09:31 - the idea so now let's look into the
09:35 - content the problem with that idea is
09:38 - it's really boring if you think about
09:40 - the technical aspects of it a map with
09:42 - just one data point is not the most
09:44 - lifechanging exciting technical feed in
09:46 - the world it's actually very boring so
09:49 - you might be tempted to look at a couple
09:51 - different angles a couple different ways
09:53 - that you want to talk about it because
09:54 - you're still really excited the first
09:57 - way you might present this topic is you
10:00 - might want to do a collage you might
10:02 - want to do three cool map projects using
10:04 - leaflet that's helpful that's
10:06 - informative but do you need to give that
10:08 - talk can anybody give that talk can that
10:11 - be in a blog post if so why are you the
10:13 - right person to tell me that
10:15 - story the next idea you might have is
10:18 - how to use leaflet to map cookie dough
10:20 - cones this one's a little bit better
10:21 - because the cookie dough cones part
10:23 - makes it a little more exciting makes it
10:24 - a little more personal but at the end of
10:26 - the day this is really just a tutorial
10:29 - now now would you rather have a tutorial
10:30 - in a talk format where you're sitting in
10:32 - an audience you're sitting in a row you
10:34 - don't have your laptop out you can't
10:35 - follow along you can't pause it you
10:37 - can't ask questions is that really the
10:39 - best way to show how to technically
10:41 - accomplish something probably not that's
10:43 - a great candidate for a YouTube video or
10:46 - a tutorial on a blog post so let's think
10:48 - about a third angle for
10:51 - this how I made a map of cookie dough
10:53 - cones ooh that's more interesting
10:57 - because the part about that that is
10:58 - interesting is not the map it's not even
11:01 - really the cookie dough Coles although
11:02 - if you're me that is really the only
11:04 - thing that matters it is the how I made
11:07 - that's the part that makes it about you
11:09 - that's the part that makes it about your
11:11 - journey and that's a story that only you
11:13 - can
11:17 - tell right okay so we are going to focus
11:21 - on that idea and we're going to talk
11:22 - about the way we might structure that
11:24 - angle so let's talk about structure now
11:27 - there are three parts to a talk one is
11:31 - the technical junk all the the tools and
11:33 - the Technologies and the buzzwords
11:36 - there's the story there's also the
11:38 - Lessons Learned now one thing I've seen
11:40 - especially when working with a lot of
11:41 - speakers and going to a ton of tech
11:42 - talks myself is people really like
11:45 - focusing on the Lessons Learned that's a
11:48 - thing that people get really excited
11:50 - about and the thing
11:52 - is nobody cares nobody cares about your
11:55 - Lessons Learned the only person who
11:57 - cares about your Lessons Learned are you
11:59 - that's it because the Lessons Learned
12:01 - are the things that you walked away with
12:03 - they're the results they're the
12:04 - solutions those are the wins but all of
12:06 - those lessons learn without any context
12:08 - doesn't mean anything and the
12:10 - interesting thing about lessons learn is
12:12 - they end up sounding super generic the
12:14 - lessons are things like communication is
12:16 - very important y right it might be
12:19 - things like uh debugging is a skill that
12:21 - takes patience I think we all know that
12:23 - it might be uh read the errors these are
12:26 - all great lessons but when you present
12:28 - that as the Forefront you're going to
12:29 - get a lot of yawns in your audience and
12:31 - we don't want
12:32 - that so the second thing as a developer
12:34 - you might be tempted to focus on is the
12:36 - technical part all of the buzzwords and
12:39 - the jargon and all that now the thing
12:41 - with that is that can be great depending
12:42 - on your audience if you have a super
12:44 - technical audience that might be what
12:46 - they're really into but more than likely
12:48 - you'll have an audience who isn't quite
12:50 - familiar familiar with your exact set of
12:53 - tools so you're going to end up either
12:55 - boring them or they'll get really
12:57 - intimidated and just kind of check out
12:58 - of your talk we don't really want that
13:00 - but really the thing about technical
13:02 - stuff is nobody cares again nobody cares
13:05 - about leaflet until they know why
13:07 - they're using it what problem they're
13:08 - trying to solve the technical stuff only
13:10 - matters in the context of your story so
13:13 - if we go through these three points we
13:15 - end up with the
13:17 - story Lessons Learned and technical
13:19 - stuff only matter in the context of the
13:21 - story which brings us to the question
13:24 - what is a story now this seems like a
13:26 - very obvious question but uh based on on
13:29 - a lot of answers I've gotten I'm going
13:30 - to go ahead and say that we need to
13:31 - review this together stories are about
13:34 - conflict I think the easy way to think
13:36 - about stories is oh there's a beginning
13:37 - middle end no no no screw that that's
13:38 - not what matters what matters is there's
13:40 - a problem I come to you I say hi I'm San
13:43 - I'm doing this thing I ran into this
13:45 - problem here's how I fixed it the moment
13:47 - you can get to I ran into this problem
13:49 - your audience will sit up they'll think
13:51 - oh crap how did you do that oh my
13:53 - goodness I've had that problem myself
13:55 - how would I solve that it immediately
13:57 - becomes interesting as soon as you
13:59 - roduce that
14:00 - tension so if we think about these three
14:03 - components this is kind of the order
14:05 - that we want to structure our talk in we
14:06 - want to start with that story we want to
14:08 - present that tension that conflict right
14:10 - off the bat as soon as we can and then
14:12 - we want to get into the technical part
14:14 - because it is a tech talk we want to
14:15 - introduce those tools the the
14:17 - terminology the framework that kind of
14:18 - thing and then we want to end with the
14:20 - lesson because the lesson is the
14:22 - resolution that's how we solve the
14:24 - problem and that's how we make sure to
14:26 - never have that problem again crossing
14:27 - our fingers so this
14:31 - means that you are going to be tempted
14:33 - to have a story section then a technical
14:37 - section then a Lessons Learned section
14:39 - now let's think about that if you
14:41 - structure a 40-minute talk in these
14:43 - sections you will have spent the first
14:46 - was it 12 and a half I wish I had done
14:48 - 40 I'll do 45 45 minute talk that means
14:50 - you'll have structured the first 15
14:52 - minutes telling awesome stories in which
14:54 - case I'm I'm excited I go oh goodie this
14:56 - is great and then you'll spend the next
14:59 - 15 minutes talking about all the tech
15:01 - things and throwing a lot of words at me
15:02 - that hopefully I understand and then you
15:04 - spend the last 15 talking about a list
15:06 - of Lessons Learned and if you remember
15:09 - the tech talks you've seen a lot of the
15:11 - technical section stuff and lessons
15:13 - stuff ends up just in bullet points and
15:16 - bullet points aren't the most exciting
15:17 - thing to look at for 15 minutes instead
15:20 - what you want to do is you want to take
15:22 - that story and you want to divide it up
15:24 - generally stories work well in groups of
15:27 - three I think most things work well in
15:28 - groups of three
15:29 - so we're going to divide our story up
15:31 - into three parts part one will have its
15:33 - own story its own conflict we'll
15:35 - introduce the technical components and
15:37 - then we'll share the Lessons Learned
15:39 - part two same structure story technical
15:41 - stuff Lessons Learned and then part
15:44 - three story technical Lessons Learned
15:46 - and if you think about the structure in
15:48 - this way the original the the more
15:50 - common definition of a story having a
15:51 - beginning middle end end up falling
15:53 - right in line part one is your beginning
15:55 - part two is your middle part three is
15:56 - your
15:57 - end now if you do it this way you'll
16:00 - have a couple benefits number one is you
16:02 - have one cohesive story those three
16:05 - parts even though they have their own
16:06 - conflict their own tension really
16:08 - they're three parts of the same Journey
16:10 - the same narrative and that makes me
16:12 - feel like I'm not being interrupted it
16:14 - gives me an incentive to keep going that
16:16 - cohesion is really really important the
16:19 - third thing that really works out when
16:21 - you have that three story structure is
16:23 - you're introducing a new adventure every
16:25 - I should have said like 33% right 33
16:28 - darn it 33% of the talk so you present a
16:31 - problem and maybe as an audience member
16:32 - I go oh I can't really relate to that
16:34 - I'm not really that interested that's
16:35 - okay 33% of the way in I get a new
16:38 - problem I get a new tension I get a new
16:41 - conflict that we're going to talk
16:42 - through so it gives me an entry point a
16:45 - ramp an on-ramp for your talk at three
16:47 - specific points which is very
16:49 - nice and the third thing is that all of
16:51 - these lessons instead of stacking them
16:53 - at the end when you interview them
16:55 - throughout your whole talk you have
16:57 - context for that
16:59 - so this goes back to one of the things
17:01 - that we talked about at the very
17:02 - beginning of this video which is that
17:05 - your talk is a performance when you
17:07 - position things as a story you're
17:09 - optimizing for that performance feel you
17:12 - can in use inflections you can use
17:14 - gestures you can bring people up you can
17:16 - bring people down you can really be a
17:17 - little more theatrical when you have
17:19 - that content structured as a story it is
17:21 - still informative by making sure we have
17:24 - a technical component in each part of
17:26 - our talk we're able to make sure we're
17:29 - giving people real information and
17:32 - ideally some next steps and some tools
17:34 - to look up afterwards and when you
17:36 - structure your talk in this way you are
17:38 - optimizing for emotion you're optimizing
17:40 - for the fact that I'm not reading a blog
17:42 - post I'm not watching a video I am
17:44 - physically here in front of you and I'm
17:46 - sharing this story with you the more I
17:48 - can make it about me and my journey the
17:50 - more able I am to connect with you and
17:53 - that can be really powerful and all of
17:55 - this is really just a bunch of building
17:56 - blocks and a bunch of tools to to
17:59 - optimize for how people will remember
18:02 - you because no one will ever remember
18:05 - what you said I'm sure a month from now
18:07 - you won't remember most of these points
18:08 - but hopefully I will have excited you
18:10 - and made you feel like you can do a
18:12 - technical talk and that's the thing that
18:14 - I want you to remember people don't
18:16 - remember what you say they only remember
18:18 - how you made them feel so the more you
18:20 - can excite them the more you can bring
18:22 - them on this journey the more you can
18:23 - make them feel resolved at the end the
18:25 - more likely they are to remember your
18:27 - talk and hopefully remember you you so
18:29 - these are all the lessons that I wanted
18:31 - to share with you uh and and my own
18:33 - takeaways from putting on Tech talk if
18:35 - you are interested in coming to cold L
18:37 - would love to have you it's specifically
18:38 - for people who have less than two years
18:40 - of professional coding experience but
18:42 - hopefully you'll hear some really great
18:43 - stories and talks uh because we'll be
18:45 - using a lot of these tools to work with
18:46 - our speakers uh you can get tickets and
18:48 - learn more at
18:50 - www.and.com
18:52 - awesome that's what I got okay I don't
18:54 - know people can hear me now I'm going
18:55 - awkwardly come back into the frame
18:57 - should I go over you can Shuffle I'll
18:59 - wait I'm going to unmute my microphone
19:01 - okay first of all thank you so much what
19:03 - you guys don't realize is zon is really
19:05 - being great here there's like a
19:07 - classroom next door there was like music
19:09 - coming in I don't think you could hear
19:10 - any of that there a lot of distractions
19:11 - so that was really wonderful thank um
19:14 - and uh you know for me I'm I'm this is
19:16 - great is particular I was actually just
19:17 - working on some slides for a very short
19:19 - presentation at codeland and to be
19:20 - honest I wasn't really thinking about
19:21 - the story of it that much it just kind
19:23 - of like well this will be interesting to
19:24 - the show and this will be interesting
19:25 - the show this is really just all for you
19:27 - so this is very helpful good for me
19:29 - personally which is what it's about no
19:31 - um so I have a bunch of great uh people
19:34 - are saying the weird guy is back yes
19:36 - that's I usually don't uh uh I have some
19:39 - some great questions from the chat first
19:41 - of all uh there was a really nice
19:42 - comment since this was a tech talk in a
19:45 - way um I just want to say there was a
19:46 - nice comment that said I like how San's
19:48 - presentation use short informal
19:50 - sentences and bold sentences and it
19:52 - makes it sort of feel powerful so that
19:53 - something you sort of thought about when
19:54 - you're yeah putting together yeah that's
19:57 - that's the thing you know I um the very
19:58 - first talk that I did I actually did a
20:00 - full I did all these original cartoons
20:02 - and I drew them and I Inked them and I
20:03 - put them up and it took a ridiculous
20:05 - amount of time so the next time I did a
20:07 - talk I did nothing I put as few slides
20:09 - up with very very simple colors and I
20:11 - realized that people actually liked it
20:13 - better when it was simple and Punchy and
20:15 - short so that's definitely something I
20:16 - think a lot about because it's
20:18 - interesting because I I do see a lot of
20:19 - talk sometimes there's no text and it's
20:20 - all just image image image and talking
20:22 - over it versus you know it didn't really
20:24 - occur to me now it was all text which I
20:25 - think you know was very simple and
20:27 - Powerful in that way um
20:29 - so one question from exjon D cool asks
20:34 - how often do you get nervous before talk
20:37 - and does it get easier now that you've
20:38 - done maybe more than one talk that's a
20:40 - great question um I get nervous all the
20:43 - time I was nervous on my way here like
20:44 - oh my God it's my first live something
20:46 - something holy crap I get super nervous
20:48 - I think the interesting thing is when
20:50 - I'm a little bit nervous I actually do
20:52 - better because it's my way of of caring
20:55 - and putting a little a little more
20:56 - thought and love into what I'm doing so
20:57 - I think being nervous is totally not a
20:59 - bad thing um some more like practical
21:01 - tips on on nerves try not to eat a lot
21:03 - before um I usually have like dry toast
21:06 - and maybe some tea and ginger ale but my
21:08 - stomach and my bowels get a little kind
21:09 - of fun but yes I get nervous all the
21:11 - time i' I've talked all over the world
21:13 - and I'm still getting nervous so yeah
21:15 - it's not just you it's all of us I'm
21:16 - just nervous whether I'm giving a talk
21:18 - or not just as in existence although I'm
21:22 - more nervous when giving before giving a
21:23 - talk actually during a talk I don't feel
21:25 - nervous anymore it's all the sort of
21:27 - anxiety building up to it once kind of
21:28 - there and if you can remember that it
21:30 - maybe it'll help a little bit yes and
21:31 - and one one quick story that I'll share
21:33 - just to to really make you feel better
21:35 - um the first talk that I did I realized
21:37 - that I was so nervous that I was
21:39 - clenching my butt cheeks to the point
21:42 - where my left one started vibrating so
21:45 - yes I get nervous that's how you it's
21:47 - amazing yeah okay uh I will go on to
21:50 - another question um these are these two
21:53 - of these questions are kind of similar
21:54 - but let me let me start with this one
21:56 - which is so this is really since you
21:57 - know Cod land is a conference for people
22:00 - without a lot of experience in code code
22:01 - newbies is a podcast that's really
22:03 - accessible and friendly to beginners
22:05 - what if you are a beginner with little
22:07 - experience um what's it how can you give
22:09 - a tech talk how can you present yourself
22:12 - with you know just with with being a
22:14 - beginner yes yeah I love that question
22:16 - um one of the the things that I've
22:18 - learned is again we we think of speakers
22:21 - as experts but if we think about them as
22:23 - storytellers I think that makes things a
22:25 - lot easier one of the most famous famous
22:28 - one of the most popular talks that I've
22:29 - given a ton I think I've given that talk
22:30 - 15 times uh was about reading code and
22:33 - it was the story of me graduating from a
22:35 - boot camp just getting my first job and
22:36 - feeling like I didn't really know what I
22:37 - was doing and so as a tool to help me
22:39 - learn I got a bunch of friends together
22:41 - for one hour every Sunday and I would
22:43 - read about a 100 lines of code and we'd
22:45 - read it together and we'd go through it
22:47 - and we'd have a discussion and my 20
22:50 - minute talk was just about that it was
22:52 - about the process of reading code as a
22:54 - tool for being a better developer I
22:56 - thought the talk was super boring um to
22:58 - this day I hate the talk I think it's
22:59 - like the worst talk ever but people
23:00 - really liked it and they liked it not
23:02 - because reading code is a new idea or
23:04 - because you know I have years of of
23:06 - experience but because I positioned it
23:08 - as you know I started in this place I
23:10 - was a beginner like a lot of you I
23:12 - really wanted to become better and
23:13 - become an expert here are the steps that
23:15 - I took uh here are the things that kind
23:17 - of went wrong along the way and people
23:18 - really enjoyed the journey so I think if
23:21 - you focus on what is a journey that I've
23:23 - had right and Journeys about stories are
23:25 - about conflict so what's a problem
23:27 - what's something you solve with
23:28 - something you're excited about I think
23:30 - you'll realize that you have a lot more
23:31 - to say than maybe you think you do now
23:34 - great people are telling me that my mic
23:36 - is rustling a little bit this is by the
23:37 - way this is like a very new day here I
23:40 - have two microphones and somebody wrote
23:41 - in the chat like Dan is pretty good at
23:43 - coding tutorials but not so good at
23:44 - sound management and I apologize for
23:47 - that so I'm doing my best here but now
23:48 - I'm sort of muting my microphone when
23:49 - I'm not talking we'll see if that helps
23:51 - um okay so I have two more questions um
23:55 - one I think is a really interesting
23:56 - question from um oh and I forgot to say
23:59 - who asked that previous question which
24:00 - was Tomas bik Nas which I'm sure I'm
24:03 - apologize for mispronouncing the name
24:05 - but Ben J habt asked and I think this is
24:07 - you know you talk so much about um
24:10 - framing the talk as a story and in a way
24:13 - like a personal story but what U how do
24:15 - you approach um giving a talk if maybe
24:19 - the work that you're presenting is from
24:20 - a company or is anything something
24:22 - that's like sort of comes from yourself
24:23 - that's maybe directed by others oh
24:25 - that's a good one so I love hearing uh
24:28 - the the company side of things because
24:30 - I'm always wondering if you work for a
24:32 - really Tech a really big tech company
24:34 - how did you do it you know who did you
24:35 - have to work with how many people were
24:36 - involved so even in that context I think
24:38 - there's still a story you know the story
24:40 - might be as simple as why did you decide
24:42 - to implement that feature what are some
24:44 - issues you had along the way are the
24:45 - sales people really as bad as everyone
24:47 - thinks they are on your team you know
24:48 - what are some of the behind the scenes
24:50 - things that you can share with us um
24:52 - that take us again on that Journey with
24:54 - that conflict on how you did stuff I
24:56 - love hearing those things um I remember
24:58 - a rails comp talk that Upworthy did uh
25:00 - in 2014 and see I still remember it um
25:03 - and they talked about how they went I
25:06 - think it was from a monolith to having a
25:07 - bunch of microservices I think um and I
25:10 - loved being able to to hear how a
25:12 - company that I really enjoy um you know
25:15 - using and using their website how they
25:17 - did that how they broke it up and the
25:18 - problems they had and the you know
25:20 - internal conflicts they had amongst team
25:21 - members and how they're able to
25:23 - eventually you know untangle that we
25:25 - hear that problem and that solution a
25:27 - lot of how do you go from to
25:28 - microservices having someone say well
25:30 - this is exactly how I did it was awesome
25:34 - great clicking my microphone my pocket
25:36 - okay so I have one I think we're going
25:37 - to wrap it up soon um certainly if
25:39 - people I know there are some more
25:40 - questions posted in the chat it's hard
25:42 - for me to follow everything but uh I'm
25:44 - sure if people have additional questions
25:46 - you can ask them in the comments once
25:48 - this video is posted and also you could
25:50 - probably ask and follow s on Twitter
25:53 - you're more than welcome to @ sironar
25:55 - first name last name and I'll there'll
25:56 - be a link to that in this video
25:58 - description as well so I think this is a
25:59 - good kind of wrapup question which um
26:02 - I'm going to rephrase it but it came
26:03 - from Cody feler which is so I guess the
26:05 - question that I have I think is how do
26:08 - you get um how do you get like let's say
26:10 - you want to give Tech talks and you want
26:12 - to speak at conferences how do you get
26:14 - started how do you find Opportunities is
26:16 - there like a do you apply do you network
26:18 - do you go to conferences first like what
26:21 - what is that process sure so a lot of
26:23 - bigger Tech conferences will have a cfp
26:25 - we had a cfp as well um I think we had
26:27 - about applications for R cfp for like 20
26:30 - to 30 spots um but a lot of conferences
26:33 - will have cfps I highly encourage you to
26:35 - submit to them it never hurts to um yes
26:38 - you will be nervous and terrified when
26:39 - you submit I literally cried the first
26:41 - time I was I was typing it up I hit the
26:43 - submit button I'm just crying and my
26:44 - husband's in the kitchen like why are
26:46 - you crying like cuz I don't know if I
26:48 - can do it so it's totally fine it's an
26:50 - emotional thing it's cool um that's one
26:52 - way the other way is meetups meetups are
26:54 - really really great place to get started
26:56 - meetups are almost always looking like
26:58 - actively looking for speakers to come in
27:00 - and give a short lightning talk 5
27:02 - minutes 10 minutes uh lightning talks
27:04 - are a great way to kind of see how you
27:06 - feel you know standing in front of
27:07 - people and talking without a huge
27:09 - commitment you know without a 20 40
27:11 - minute commitment so I think meetups are
27:12 - um a great way to do it also if you're
27:14 - working at a tech company in a tech role
27:16 - if your company does brown bag lunches
27:18 - that's a great opportunity to speak uh
27:20 - and if they don't do brown bag lunches
27:22 - you should start one and you should
27:23 - offer to coordinate them um and to you
27:25 - know give talks in the office as well
27:27 - those are some really good places to
27:28 - start great okay thank you everybody um
27:31 - I know this is a bit of a shorter live
27:33 - stream than my usual ranting and raving
27:35 - for like three and a half hours about
27:37 - some problem that I can't debug but um
27:39 - this is great I know it's always awkward
27:40 - to like come and do this like you're
27:42 - talking to a camera and you know what's
27:44 - going on here it's and it's hard to
27:46 - present in these context and this was
27:47 - really great and I hope that people um
27:49 - take something from this so again um I
27:51 - would really recommend that you
27:53 - subscribe to the code newbies podcast um
27:56 - and check out the code land conference
27:58 - uh if you have follow-up questions you
27:59 - can ask me on Twitter you can ask San on
28:02 - Twitter that'll that stuff will be in
28:03 - the video's description and um again uh
28:06 - if you're watching this live right now
28:07 - and you missed it just check back I
28:09 - would say tomorrow afternoon by then
28:11 - hopefully we'll have I don't know if I'm
28:12 - speaking out of turn here but sometime
28:14 - later this week sometimes soon we'll
28:15 - have an archived version of this video
28:17 - available and and perhaps even with that
28:19 - archived version I'll edit out this
28:20 - weird part now I have to like wander
28:22 - behind you and like click a button over
28:24 - here there's no other way to say goodbye
28:27 - oh also I'll be back on Friday let me
28:28 - just mention sorry I'll be back on
28:30 - Friday for my usual coding tutorial
28:33 - thing about the one thing that might
28:35 - this different just check back I'll
28:37 - it'll be on YouTube or on Twitter I
28:39 - might do the afternoon instead of the
28:40 - morning based on my schedule so that's
28:43 - what's coming up and we'll see you later
