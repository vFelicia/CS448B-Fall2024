00:00 - hello I'm back to continue my exciting
00:03 - snakes and ladders game and what I'm
00:07 - realizing and what you've seen as I've
00:09 - been kind of putting this together in a
00:10 - very messy and overly complicated
00:14 - probably way is it's very hard to know
00:16 - what's going on and whether it's working
00:18 - or not I in-between this last part that
00:20 - you might have seen in this I'd stopped
00:22 - and I'd like check some things so I'm
00:23 - pretty sure that it is working correctly
00:25 - logically but it would really help I
00:27 - could just sort of do some debugging by
00:29 - like console logging more stuff to see
00:31 - what it's doing but I would really like
00:32 - to just see an animation so I would like
00:35 - to see an animation where I kind of
00:36 - think of the game as having different
00:39 - states there's the state where I am
00:42 - somewhere then there's the state where I
00:43 - roll the die or the die if that's or
00:46 - maybe it's been whatever it is roll the
00:48 - die and then I see where I'm going to
00:51 - move to then I move there then if that
00:54 - part is a snake or a ladder I see that
00:56 - I'm going to move to a new spot if not
00:58 - I'm just going to roll again so I want
01:00 - to think about different states so I'm
01:03 - gonna do this in a goofy way that is a
01:06 - minute for the first time in my life
01:07 - ever use Const because what I really
01:10 - want to do is make some constants that
01:12 - are like look that are talking about the
01:15 - state of the game so I'm gonna say oh
01:17 - this is probably I'm gonna say roll
01:20 - state oh this is like so overly like
01:24 - talkie and too many characters but I'm
01:26 - gonna I'm if it's afraid to call it roll
01:28 - because what if I thing else called roll
01:30 - roll state where I'm rolling the die I'm
01:34 - gonna say a preview state which actually
01:38 - is that the sames when I roll the die I
01:39 - see the preview of where I'm about to go
01:41 - so I'm gonna make that's gonna be the
01:42 - same then I'm going to have move state
01:45 - where I draw my next move and then I'm
01:49 - going to have a snake ladder what's a
01:53 - word there's got to be a word for snake
01:55 - and ladder Schnatter lake
01:59 - let's try Snyder I like that Schnatter
02:03 - s'matter
02:04 - which is that the state of moving to the
02:08 - snake or ladder if that exists and then
02:10 - I'm gonna go back to the roll state so
02:12 - looking through
02:13 - the draw loop let's think about what
02:16 - happens so if so now I need a variable
02:20 - called state and States is going to
02:23 - start at roll state so I'm gonna start
02:28 - the game the game is gonna have the roll
02:29 - States
02:30 - so if then I'm going in to draw I'm
02:32 - always gonna draw all the tiles why not
02:35 - I'm always gonna draw all the Snider's
02:38 - that's my new word show Snyder's
02:41 - refactoring that's my word for snakes
02:44 - and ladders so if I go into the tile
02:48 - object show Snyder's and this should
02:53 - actually be I could probably do some
02:54 - global find and replace I might change
02:56 - that later from snake or ladder to
02:57 - s'matter okay so now back here player
03:02 - dot roll so definitely this is something
03:04 - that happens if state equals if state
03:11 - equals roll state I want to roll and I
03:16 - want to increase the number of rolls
03:18 - okay
03:19 - so that I want to do now then I want to
03:23 - maybe had to say player show preview so
03:28 - in the player what the player does in
03:32 - roll is have an actual so right now I do
03:37 - everything all at once I roll the die I
03:38 - move the spot I draw the tide I check if
03:42 - it's a snake or ladder I move it so I
03:44 - got to divide all this up into different
03:45 - parts this will make this better
03:47 - so I need more variables always the
03:51 - board variables the answer is more
03:52 - variables this dot roll maybe I can use
03:57 - the word die I don't know that because
04:00 - for I'm going to say roll equals
04:02 - yeah roll equals negative 1 so it
04:06 - doesn't have a roll at the beginning and
04:07 - this is gonna be rolled die I'm gonna
04:09 - call this roll die actually rolling the
04:12 - die and then I'm gonna keep whatever
04:15 - this roll is so that's the only thing
04:16 - I'm gonna do in roll die so I don't know
04:20 - something this is something else
04:21 - Oh figure that out later all I want to
04:24 - do is pick that roll and so go back to
04:26 - the sketch
04:27 - I want to role die and I don't need the
04:32 - tiles so back in the player I don't need
04:36 - the tiles I'm just picking that number
04:38 - now what I said that I want to do I
04:41 - think is show the preview so what I
04:44 - might like to do is just kind of like
04:45 - highlight all the ones up until the next
04:48 - spot so I need to like figure out what
04:50 - the next spot is but not actually move
04:51 - the player there yet so if I think about
04:54 - that actually what I do is I maybe I
04:59 - have next I have a next this dot next
05:05 - equals negative one is it nice by the
05:08 - way how all of these variables have the
05:10 - same number of characters they line up
05:12 - so nicely that makes me so happy so I'm
05:16 - going to say then this dot next equals
05:20 - this dot spot plus this dot roll right
05:26 - so I keep track of the current spot and
05:29 - the next role and then I want to say
05:32 - player show preview and what the preview
05:39 - is going to do and I'm going to need the
05:40 - tiles for this is it's going to
05:42 - highlight some of the tiles so I'm going
05:45 - to say for let I equal this dot spot is
05:50 - less than this dot next and the end is
05:56 - going to be if if this dot next is that
06:00 - is past the end of the tiles so I have
06:03 - to say the end is the maximum of this
06:10 - dot next and tiles dot length right if
06:15 - this dot no no no the minimum whichever
06:19 - ones lower minimum are the maximum right
06:22 - I want to say like if if next is 12 then
06:24 - the number of tiles is 10 I want the end
06:26 - to be 10 so it's whichever one is the
06:29 - smaller than one so I think that's the
06:31 - minimum function I'll fine so I'm going
06:34 - to go all the way up to the end I plus
06:37 - plus and I'm gonna say tiles index I
06:40 - high
06:42 - so what that's going to do it should
06:44 - highlight all of the tiles that I'm
06:47 - about to move to and so if I go into
06:49 - tile and I create a highlight function I
06:55 - can just say let me highlight them with
06:57 - a nice little green and some alpha and
07:00 - draw that rectangle so what happens dare
07:04 - I dare I attempt to run this now and
07:07 - just see this so what I'm going to do
07:09 - actually is comment out the rest of all
07:13 - of this and see if I can roll the die
07:18 - and see the highlighting show Snider's
07:24 - it's not a function
07:26 - really really sketchup test line 63
07:30 - shows Natters is not a function shows
07:35 - Natters snakes and let Schnatter it's
07:39 - not a Schnatter it's a stack s'matter
07:42 - show Schnatter show Schnatter never
07:46 - record coding challenges late in the
07:48 - evening on a Friday all right cannot
07:52 - read property length of undefined
07:53 - players is line 13 so let's figure this
07:56 - out tiles doesn't know what it is
08:00 - because I forgot to pass in the tiles
08:03 - when I call show preview probably you
08:04 - just use tiles of the global variable
08:05 - but cannot read highlight of undefined
08:10 - now I think I know why this is the
08:12 - problem so in the show preview function
08:17 - when the game starts the player is
08:21 - actually at spot negative one because it
08:23 - needs to a role of one gets you to the
08:25 - first spot so I do have this other thing
08:27 - where I need to say start equals the
08:30 - maximum of zero and this dot spot so if
08:33 - it's negative one I gotta think I can
08:37 - fix that right maximum means the highest
08:39 - is that right is that right oh no no I'm
08:43 - doing it backwards I'm doing it
08:45 - backwards if you want the maximum to be
08:48 - ten you use minimum because I want the
08:51 - lower one
08:52 - I did that backwards all along silly me
08:57 - silly me silly silly me all right cannot
09:01 - read properly highlight of undefined so
09:03 - let's look at let's look at console dot
09:08 - log I right here just to sort of see
09:11 - whoops the e key on my computer barely
09:14 - works negative one it's still got
09:16 - negative one the minimum no no I did it
09:19 - backwards again okay here we go
09:22 - there we go okay so we can see here I'm
09:24 - getting that preview perfect perfect I'm
09:27 - getting that preview for state one now
09:29 - I'm not doing anything but doing that
09:30 - over and over again but that's great
09:32 - now what I need to do is say the state
09:35 - what happens now immediately equals move
09:39 - state what I call it move state move
09:41 - state yep the state should equal move
09:45 - state now if the state equals move state
09:54 - then what I actually want to do is move
09:57 - the player so I'm gonna say player dot
10:01 - move so I'm gonna say player dot move
10:04 - and in the player I'm going to say move
10:10 - and I think it's really just a matter of
10:13 - saying this dot spot equals this dot
10:17 - next right just move it to the next spot
10:21 - and I could also like check if it's off
10:25 - the edge at the end but let's not worry
10:26 - about that right now then what I want to
10:29 - do a ball of these I want to call player
10:32 - dot show right I want to say player dot
10:36 - show right which just draws the player
10:38 - in the spot where is the show function
10:44 - and I need to give it the tiles this is
10:47 - really kind of convoluted about giving
10:49 - the touch all right so then I'm gonna
10:54 - give it the tiles because it needs to
10:56 - figure out what tile to show itself on
10:58 - so let's try this all right so why did
11:03 - this happen only once did I put a No
11:06 - been there zero one two what's what is
11:09 - what am i console logging anyway I
11:13 - wanted I want to move and then I wanted
11:17 - oh and then I want to set the sorry
11:20 - state equal to roll state so I'm gonna
11:25 - have to check the snakes soon but let me
11:28 - do this so let me do this oh yeah so let
11:30 - me set the frame rate down this is great
11:32 - now I've really got something I can kind
11:34 - of track a little bit let me put the
11:36 - frame rate back down oh look at that
11:39 - whoa wait a second something's wrong
11:41 - here I want to see a head and then I
11:46 - want to see it move I want to see it in
11:48 - its old spot what do I have wrong all
11:51 - right what do I have wrong oh boy this
11:57 - needs to be an else--if right because I
12:00 - just changed it to move State and then I
12:02 - do it immediately but no no no I only
12:04 - wanna be able to do one of these states
12:05 - yes switch statement would have done me
12:08 - well here so let's now run this again
12:10 - and I have an error cannot get Center of
12:14 - undefined Claire J s line 44 let's
12:17 - Center equals current current equals
12:19 - tiles dot this dot spot so what is this
12:23 - dot spot there it is negative one
12:30 - because once again I can't draw the
12:34 - player at its negative spot so this is a
12:37 - case that as long as this dot spot is
12:41 - yeah I guess a nice way of doing this
12:43 - would be if if not current returned so
12:49 - just like get out of here this is one
12:51 - way that I could do it if there's no
12:51 - current thing I don't need to draw it
12:53 - get out of here it moves but it's moving
12:59 - one spot beyond where the role is right
13:05 - so why is that so that's a little bit of
13:08 - a mistake the role says I need to
13:13 - include the next less than or equal to
13:16 - next I need to go all the way up to that
13:18 - spot
13:20 - there we go moves are there I kind of
13:23 - want to keep the highlight in there but
13:26 - I could do it but at least I could see
13:28 - so this is really doing what I wanted to
13:30 - do now I can see it it's roll and then
13:32 - it moves there now now what I want to do
13:37 - is oh it's going to land on the ladder
13:38 - but it's not gonna go to a snake it's
13:40 - not going to go down now or that's a
13:41 - ladder visually I've got some real
13:44 - serious graphic design issues there now
13:46 - what I need to do is at the end of the
13:49 - move state at the end of the move state
13:52 - I need to check if the player is on us
13:57 - if the player so if the player is honest
14:00 - matter I need to do something otherwise
14:07 - I can just go back to the roll state
14:10 - right if the player is honest matter now
14:12 - how do I know that what do I have going
14:14 - on is that the something else
14:16 - that I hadn't figured out yet yes it
14:19 - sort of is right so this is I can call
14:22 - this is Schnatter
14:24 - and I can say I can look at the tile at
14:30 - its spot and I can say if tile snake or
14:35 - ladder is not equal to 0 return true so
14:42 - this at least so as long as there as
14:45 - long as it's actually on a tile and that
14:48 - tile is a snake or a ladder return true
14:51 - otherwise return false let's just put
14:55 - this in there right now and I know I
14:57 - could return the result of this let's do
14:59 - that but I might want to do some other
15:01 - stuff in here which maybe is a bad idea
15:02 - so let me just return the result of this
15:06 - just to like make this a little bit more
15:10 - elegant and I need more space to see my
15:14 - code as long as there is a tile and hey
15:18 - that tile is a snake or a ladder return
15:20 - true otherwise
15:21 - oh no otherwise return false that's what
15:23 - I'm doing so now if I were to go out
15:29 - into the sketch I'm going to say
15:33 - No you know like no loop console dot log
15:40 - hello so I just want to see that right
15:43 - there
15:44 - it's stuff so if I can get lucky and
15:46 - have it land on one of these so now I
15:48 - can speed it up and it should stop at
15:51 - some point it'll land on one of these it
15:54 - didn't and it got to the end so if it
15:56 - gets to the end so let's fix it so it
15:59 - starts over again
16:00 - player dot J s line 21 player - line 21
16:04 - if it gets to the end and the end is
16:07 - this is the last one now that have less
16:11 - than equals the length minus 1 that
16:13 - should fix that okay if you guess the
16:17 - end it didn't actually restart because I
16:19 - got rid of all that game logic
16:20 - what is this player dot j s line 20
16:22 - though I don't need this anymore
16:24 - thank you Mike come on land on one of
16:28 - these oh I know a way to fix that let's
16:30 - have it just move one spot every time
16:33 - the roll is always one Oh interesting so
16:38 - it's not detecting that it's landing on
16:41 - a Schnatter why not if I mess something
16:44 - up let's let's look at this return tile
16:53 - this is the tile that it's on this dot
16:56 - spot right because it has moved its
17:00 - moved oh this is not a I didn't call the
17:03 - function so if I didn't rename the funk
17:07 - is is Schnatter okay great
17:10 - there we go so we can see it stopped so
17:13 - that's good I'm detecting that correctly
17:14 - now what I want to do is go to another
17:17 - state I want to say state equals what
17:21 - did I call it
17:24 - s'matter state state equals Schnatter
17:35 - state okay so now Oh
17:39 - go back to the role state so you can
17:41 - move and go back to the role state now I
17:43 - need to check else if state equals
17:46 - Schnatter state oh this is very exciting
17:50 - Oh everything is so much harder to
17:52 - program than you think if state equals
17:55 - Schnatter stake state creating a
17:59 - tongue-twister here now what I need to
18:01 - do is what I need to go back to here and
18:06 - where's my something else the stuff that
18:08 - I saved did I lose it well this is the
18:11 - time where I need to move Schnatter
18:15 - move Schnatter
18:18 - so what I want to do is I want to say
18:20 - this dot it's why need I'm the player I
18:23 - need the reference to the tiles you know
18:25 - what this is ridiculous I should really
18:28 - have the player just store an internal
18:30 - an internal variable that stores a
18:33 - reference to the like it could actually
18:35 - add this dot tiles here and it points to
18:37 - the tiles or just use as a global
18:38 - variable I think for expediency right
18:40 - now I'm trying to stay true to object
18:42 - oriented programming in some way there's
18:44 - really no point in me passing in the
18:46 - tiles everywhere because I can just use
18:50 - the fact that it is a global variable
18:51 - tiles Styles tiles is a global variable
18:55 - I need it everywhere let's not go nuts
18:58 - let's take that out of having to pass it
19:01 - through everywhere and just know that
19:03 - the player can go look up stuff in the
19:05 - tiles whenever it wants to because what
19:08 - I need to do right now in the player is
19:10 - move according to this matter so I need
19:13 - to get its current spot and it actually
19:17 - would make sense that the spot perhaps
19:19 - not to be an index but to store which
19:20 - tile it's on but that aside then I could
19:23 - say this dot spot plus equal the tiles
19:29 - snake or ladder value so now let's go
19:34 - and just change this to Schnatter
19:39 - to be consistent so let's find
19:43 - everywhere I say this dot snake or
19:46 - ladder and change that to this dot
19:48 - Schnatter
19:50 - and replace all
19:52 - and that should be make our lives a
19:55 - little bit more consistent so now if
19:58 - state equals Schnatter state now what do
20:01 - I do
20:01 - I say player dot what did I call it
20:05 - move Snyder move Snyder so there's a
20:10 - regular move and there's a Schnatter
20:12 - move and those happen separately and as
20:14 - soon as that's done the state goes back
20:16 - to the role state okay let's see if we
20:19 - let's see if this is if we're good here
20:23 - where did everything go
20:25 - this is a bad sign let's look at the
20:30 - player the spot is not a number next
20:33 - it's not a number so something went
20:35 - wrong with the players next and spot
20:38 - almost immediately so let's take out
20:42 - this little bit here let's take out this
20:46 - else if to see if the move SNAT are
20:49 - really just screwed stuff up spot zero
20:54 - roll one next zero but it's because hmm
20:59 - I'm gonna just back up for a second and
21:02 - I'll go back to move state roll state
21:05 - move state roll state okay so move state
21:07 - roll state works hey what happened to my
21:09 - Snyder's why don't I see them anymore I
21:14 - must be something to do with the show
21:18 - Snyder's so these seem to not exist oh
21:23 - because I left this in there I left the
21:26 - tiles in one spot which is really a
21:28 - problem when I was like refactoring I
21:29 - left that in there so is there some
21:31 - other place I
21:32 - I have tiles and this is okay so let's
21:38 - see here what have I done to deserve
21:40 - this
21:41 - if this dots not or does not it probably
21:45 - also messed something up when I oh I
21:49 - know I think I might know what the
21:50 - problem is I think I know what the
21:52 - problem is I refactored oh this is I'm a
21:55 - terrible programmer and I change didn't
21:57 - change the property here that's why we
22:00 - don't have them anymore so let's put
22:02 - that back okay now we're back
22:06 - where we were before my refactoring
22:08 - actually caused more problems than its
22:10 - solved so let me see now if I can put
22:13 - this back and even I don't know I'm just
22:17 - gonna go crazy and put this Schnatter
22:18 - snake back okay so uh huh okay good now
22:22 - I'm back I'm still debugging let's let's
22:27 - go back to all right so do we ever get
22:31 - to what's causing the problem we did we
22:34 - lose immediately okay hold on by the way
22:37 - this I really should this is a little
22:39 - nice little improvement I can make but
22:41 - let's figure out let's figure out where
22:42 - it's going wrong I'm gonna back out of
22:43 - my adding the Snyder State let's go back
22:48 - and just see all right I still have a
22:53 - problem that's good so I have a problem
22:55 - where spot zero Row one oh and I forgot
23:00 - this has to be in there that's where the
23:01 - problem is okay so this is fine this is
23:06 - fine
23:07 - now do I detect at least I can say is
23:13 - this detect correctly if it lands on one
23:18 - it's gonna keep going whoops whoops I
23:22 - don't want that this is another I don't
23:25 - want this else here so so much mess but
23:28 - I just want to see if the detection oh
23:30 - it's detecting it all the time no my is
23:33 - Schnatter function is a big problem this
23:35 - function is not working properly so let
23:38 - me look at the player object if Oh this
23:46 - I forgot the boy this renaming of
23:50 - variables really really bad bad bad
23:54 - shipment all right so now we're not
23:57 - seeing it yep there we go we landed on a
24:00 - spot and there we go so we land it on
24:03 - two there were just two and we can see
24:06 - here when we land on one we got one
24:08 - another one another one okay so we're
24:10 - good now now we're good with the is
24:15 - is Schnatter okay we're good with its
24:17 - natter now we can go back to once we are
24:23 - honest natter setting that state to the
24:26 - Snider state otherwise go back to the
24:29 - role state okay oops and I've got my
24:31 - brackets out of place there we go so
24:35 - basically what I'm doing here is I move
24:37 - the player if it's a snake or a ladder
24:39 - go to that state otherwise just roll
24:42 - again so now if it is a snake or a
24:44 - ladder
24:44 - let's try actually doing this and
24:46 - rolling oh it's working look did you see
24:52 - that now it happens really fast
24:54 - look what's gonna happen when it gets to
24:56 - there it goes back see we're in this
24:59 - nice loop and we're actually seeing it
25:01 - we're actually seeing it if I slowed it
25:02 - down a little more you know it might be
25:04 - nice to animate it going you sliding
25:06 - down that thing but as you can see you
25:09 - probably don't want to watch me try to
25:11 - okay so we're we're in pretty good shape
25:14 - now a couple things I need to do number
25:16 - one is I need to figure out if the game
25:17 - is over so that should work fine this
25:20 - should be the same idea if the player
25:22 - spot is greater than equal to the end
25:24 - keep it at the end set game over equal
25:27 - to true I don't need this player show
25:28 - anymore
25:29 - if game is over reset the player all
25:31 - this stuff should really still work in
25:33 - terms of averaging and all of that so
25:36 - let's put all this stuff back and let's
25:38 - run this now the thing is I need to be
25:41 - able to roll more than just a 1 and I
25:45 - want to slow it down a tiny bit so I can
25:47 - really watch and see that it's running
25:49 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go by
25:51 - a minute not make the frame rate 1 frame
25:52 - per second but I make it 5 frames per
25:54 - second and then by golly I am going to
26:01 - really trying to like keep up the energy
26:04 - right it's like fading fast but I'm
26:06 - keeping it up I am going to up be able
26:11 - to roll 1 through 6 so if I go back to
26:14 - here I want to roll 1 through 6 and now
26:17 - here we go so I'm seeing where I roll
26:20 - now remember white is a snake so I fell
26:23 - down I got past it here we go I got up
26:26 - the ladder and we made it to the end
26:29 - yes we are making snakes enough now you
26:34 - can see here that my talent well it
26:37 - barely lies in anything I talent lies in
26:39 - maybe talking and coding at the same
26:41 - time although I kind of do that brother
26:43 - ridiculously employed my talent
26:44 - certainly doesn't lie in visual design
26:47 - in interaction design there's a lot of
26:50 - improvements here but at least I'm kind
26:51 - of showing you the pieces here how could
26:53 - you create these different states now
26:54 - that I have these different states I
26:55 - could actually have internal animations
26:57 - in those states as well so let me at
27:00 - least just to really like feel that this
27:02 - is working in an interesting way let me
27:04 - go back to the sketch just to finish off
27:07 - here let me make five five snakes five
27:15 - ladders let me make let me instead of
27:20 - making it ten by ten let's make it
27:22 - twenty by twenty for fun so I'm used to
27:25 - look for that resolution to make it
27:27 - twenty now and then let me let it run
27:31 - quickly so we're going to now watch a
27:34 - simulation of snakes and ladders on a
27:37 - twenty by twenty grid I'll make I'll
27:41 - make this bigger and see how this plays
27:44 - out whoa okay I forgot that my circle is
27:47 - much too big so we can see that on this
27:49 - twenty by twenty grid with these random
27:51 - snakes and ladders that we are averaging
27:55 - so far sixty seven rolls let's let that
27:59 - this is a little bit of a bug here that
28:00 - when I'm drawing the player the player
28:02 - should be drawn according to the tile
28:04 - size so I I guess this where does that
28:09 - does that have a where can I access that
28:12 - I'm not gonna I don't know I'm just
28:13 - gonna make that sixteen right now so I
28:16 - could refine so now we can see here is
28:18 - it and I almost want to make this even
28:21 - more insane by just creating fifteen of
28:25 - each and now let's watch this totally
28:30 - insane snakes and ladders game can it
28:32 - ever make it it's doesn't made oh it
28:34 - made it in 75 rolls I made it in like
28:36 - just a few rolls so we can now see we
28:39 - can see this is something if you try to
28:41 - create a
28:42 - math formula to compute the average
28:45 - amount of rolls that would take for it
28:47 - to make it from the beginning to the end
28:48 - I don't know that you could do that but
28:50 - now we can watch this little Monte Carlo
28:52 - simulation of just running it over and
28:54 - over again and kind of get that average
28:55 - ourselves so this is snakes and ladders
28:57 - so much you could do to animate this
28:59 - better to make it a game that you could
29:01 - play to try different ideas out to think
29:05 - about the space not as a grid but as
29:08 - some kind of like you know pathway
29:11 - you know Candyland like pathway so many
29:14 - possibilities and yes I should have used
29:18 - ctrl shift F to find a replace in all of
29:21 - the spots but next time I will do a
29:23 - better job of that so this is our really
29:24 - for sure definitely
29:27 - the end of this game which I am now told
29:32 - from the live chat that this is also
29:34 - called escalators and eels
29:36 - snakes and ladders chutes and ladders
29:38 - escalators and eels make your own thanks
29:40 - for watching see you in a future coda
29:42 - challenge
29:47 - [Music]
