00:04 - I walked into this.
00:05 - You know what?
00:05 - I'm going to leave
this in the video
00:06 - because this really
happened, and it's there.
00:08 - So the previous video I made,
I just looked at really, really
00:13 - the basics of the control
structure of the loop--
00:15 - a while loop, a for loop.
00:16 - For looping, this sort
of primary looping
00:18 - structure that I'm going to
use for the rest of examples.
00:20 - And all I did was
something very basic--
00:22 - use it to draw a
repeating shape.
00:23 - And now it's up to
you to figure out
00:25 - what kinds of creative things
you can try to experiment with
00:28 - to create different
new kinds of patterns
00:30 - that you haven't
explored before.
00:31 - But I think there are two key
elements that I would like
00:34 - to discuss that I think
will fill in a couple
00:37 - gaps in your knowledge
here that will help
00:40 - you do more stuff with loops.
00:42 - So the first thing
that I want to mention
00:44 - is I started talking about loops
as if this is this new thing,
00:49 - but there actually is
this draw function.
00:52 - And the one of the
very first things
00:54 - I looked at in an earlier
video is this draw function
00:56 - is looping.
00:58 - And every time we get to the
end of the draw function,
01:00 - the screen is updated.
01:01 - Then the draw function repeats.
01:03 - Stuff is drawn again.
01:04 - Screen is updated.
01:05 - So sometimes it gets a
little bit confusing here.
01:07 - If you have this loop,
like there's this for loop
01:10 - that I just created in the
previous example, which
01:14 - is inside the draw loop.
01:16 - This all comes back
together because this video
01:19 - is all about nested loops
because this is really
01:21 - a nested loop.
01:22 - Draw's looping.
01:23 - The for loop is looping.
01:25 - But the goal of this
loop was to do what?
01:29 - It was to draw multiple
shapes, repeat the same ellipse
01:34 - function over and
over and over again.
01:36 - However, if you're thinking
about this kind of in almost
01:39 - too much detail, you
might have noticed
01:42 - while this loop
is going, it's not
01:43 - like you see like
the first ellipse.
01:45 - Then you see the second one.
01:45 - Then you see the third one.
01:47 - Then you see the fourth one.
01:48 - You just see them all.
01:49 - You might also
think to yourself,
01:50 - OK, well, it's drawing
the one at a time,
01:52 - but it happened so fast.
01:54 - It looks like it's
just all of it.
01:55 - So I would like to remind you
that neither of those things
01:58 - is the case.
01:59 - In fact, the window, the
canvas is not updated
02:02 - until the end of
draw is reached.
02:05 - So the purpose of a for
loop inside the draw loop
02:09 - is not to animate
something but rather
02:13 - to draw a whole bunch of things
for each cycle of the draw
02:17 - loop.
02:17 - If you want to
animate things, you
02:19 - would have to do something
slightly different.
02:22 - So let's take a look in
this particular example.
02:24 - So I'm going to draw these back
in the middle-- these circles.
02:28 - So the circles are just there.
02:30 - I'm seeing all of them.
02:31 - Nothing is changing.
02:32 - I could do a couple of things.
02:33 - One, I could add random for
the blue value of the color.
02:40 - Can you see that?
02:41 - Whoa, yeah, that's
really like the worst--
02:45 - let me make this random
too because you can barely
02:48 - see that.
02:48 - Now you can see that more.
02:49 - So you can see that draw is
looping over and over again,
02:52 - and the only thing
that's changing
02:54 - is that the color is changing.
02:56 - The location of these
ellipses from that loop
02:58 - are staying the same.
02:59 - I could do something
kind of strange,
03:01 - and I could say let me add
a variable like offset.
03:05 - And I could say
draw every ellipse
03:07 - at the x. x is
part of this loop.
03:10 - Oh my goodness, I'm
flickering like crazy.
03:12 - This camera is having
problems, but hopefully, you're
03:14 - going to be able to get
through this video, anyway.
03:18 - X the same every time through.
03:21 - X is the same every
time through draw
03:24 - because x is making
me crazy governing
03:28 - the location of those circles.
03:30 - But if I were to say offset
equals offset plus one,
03:36 - now you can see I'm offsetting
the location of all of those
03:40 - by some amount.
03:43 - These are kind of like a
few strange quick things
03:45 - that I've added here.
03:46 - But the point of
what I wanted to make
03:48 - is you just need to
keep that in mind.
03:51 - This draw loop is for
the purpose of refreshing
03:54 - that flip book metaphor, I
think, works well or analogy.
03:57 - Someone will correct me.
03:59 - The flip book idea, you've got
a page and then a next page
04:04 - and a next page and a next page.
04:05 - There's no flip book here.
04:06 - This is in order to perform a
repeating task on a single page
04:10 - in the flip book for animation.
04:12 - So that's the first thing
that I wanted to note.
04:15 - The other thing
that comes up very
04:17 - often is kind of related
to this because what
04:20 - happens if now inside this
loop, I put another loop?
04:28 - For every x, do
something to every y.
04:32 - And let's think about
how that might be useful.
04:35 - And this is a kind of
algorithm or process
04:38 - that comes up over
and over again
04:40 - and again in any sort
of computer graphics
04:43 - programming and other kinds
of programming as well.
04:45 - Why?
04:46 - Because the canvas-- the
thing that we're drawing to--
04:49 - is a two-dimensional grid.
04:51 - It has pixels along
the x-axis, and it
04:54 - has pixels along the y-axis.
04:57 - So if I would like to draw
04:59 - something for every x,
fill in all the y's.
05:04 - So for the first
x do all the y's.
05:06 - For the next x, do all the y's.
05:09 - Now for the next
x, do all the y's.
05:12 - The way that that works is
to say for var x equals zero,
05:19 - the rest of the for loop,
and then for every x--
05:22 - assuming this x is going up--
05:24 - every time you do
an x, also do a y.
05:29 - So this is a little
tricky to get used to,
05:31 - but it's incredibly
powerful and will open up
05:33 - a lot of possibilities.
05:34 - If you want to
program a game that
05:37 - involves a two-dimensional
board of cells,
05:40 - like chess or
checkers, you're going
05:41 - to need some sort of
structure like this.
05:43 - If you want to learn
about image processing,
05:45 - how do you read every
pixel of an image
05:46 - and make that pixel a little
brighter, a little darker,
05:49 - or apply some other
kind of effect,
05:50 - you're going to need
this kind of loop.
05:52 - So it comes up over and over
again in so many things.
05:54 - So let's look at that
and applying the code.
05:56 - And I'm still here.
05:57 - Hopefully, it won't flicker
and disappear too much.
06:00 - So what I'm going to do, I'm
going to get rid of this.
06:03 - I'm going to save
this project as.
06:07 - I'm saving these
because some day,
06:08 - I will upload them
somewhere, I suppose.
06:11 - I am going to remove
this weird offset thing.
06:16 - I'll keep the random
fill-- why not.
06:19 - We don't need this offset.
06:21 - And what I want to do is
add right here another loop.
06:27 - For y equals zero, y is less
than or equal to height.
06:32 - Y goes up by 50 and draw
the ellipse at x comma y.
06:39 - This is exactly what
we were talking about.
06:41 - For every x, do every y.
06:43 - So my first x, do all the y's.
06:45 - The next x, do all the y's.
06:46 - And let's see if
this works-- whoa.
06:50 - It did, so now we
have this perfect grid
06:53 - of circles flashing random
colors all over the window.
06:57 - How could you make
those colors not random?
06:59 - How might you apply some
sort of pattern to it?
07:01 - How might you do all sorts
of interesting things
07:03 - like have those circle
start to shake a little bit?
07:05 - That's a little bit
more complicated.
07:07 - You're going to need some other
tools and objects and rays
07:09 - for a bit more.
07:10 - But you can start to think about
all of these possibilities.
07:14 - And I just want to
point out that, again,
07:16 - if I were to take this loop--
07:21 - and I did this
sort of backwards.
07:22 - I don't know why
I'm showing you this
07:23 - because it works so nicely.
07:25 - But if I were to not
do it this way, if I
07:30 - were to do this two
loops, this is what I've
07:38 - got with two separate loops.
07:39 - I'm doing all the x's
along the y column 200.
07:43 - And now I'm doing all the
y's along the y row 200.
07:47 - Now I'm doing all the
y's in the x column 200.
07:50 - So I don't know.
07:51 - I had this in my mind.
07:52 - I was going to show this first.
07:53 - And so now I'm
showing this after,
07:54 - which really doesn't
make a lot of sense.
07:56 - But I'm just like letting
this video fly with all
07:58 - of its weirdness and error.
08:00 - So let me go back to
what it was correctly.
08:02 - That was sort of pointless,
can take that out.
08:06 - I think this is a nicer place
to end, looking at this again.
08:10 - So what I've talked now about--
08:11 - really very little but kind of
giving you a running start here
08:14 - and thinking about loops.
08:16 - The loop is something
to repeat a certain task
08:19 - during one cycle of draw.
08:20 - And you can use a loop
anywhere, but right now, I'm
08:23 - using it to draw multiple copies
of a shape inside of draw.
08:28 - You can also use a nested
loop to see a grid.
08:31 - If you draw, remember
is the flip book.
08:34 - So each time
through draw, if you
08:36 - change some aspect
of the loop, I just
08:38 - thought of something really
interesting that we could try.
08:41 - Like for example, everything
can be a variable right here.
08:44 - The x loop stops at width.
08:47 - What if I were to
put mouse x here?
08:50 - So I would just want
to dynamically loop
08:52 - up to where the mouse is.
08:54 - So now this loop, remember, is
executing every single time,
08:57 - but the exit condition
is changing every time
08:59 - through draw.
09:00 - And you're still watching.
09:01 - This was a little nugget
here that's hopefully useful.
09:04 - OK, so that gives you
the basics about loops,
09:07 - how loop works within draw,
how you have a nested loop,
09:11 - and I need to make
one more video, which
09:12 - won't happen today because I now
have to go do something else.
09:15 - But I want to look at an array
and how loop relates to that.
09:19 - OK, thank you and goodbye.
09:21 - This is where I need to end.
