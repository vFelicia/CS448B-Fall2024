00:00 - hello welcome to another matter j/s
00:03 - physics engine tutorial video in this
00:06 - video I'm going to attempt to make
00:07 - something like this now you might be
00:10 - wondering oh look at that that's a
00:11 - matter J s page so one in rods in my
00:14 - previous videos is that matter dot yes
00:16 - on the website has a patient you can
00:18 - click on called demos where you can
00:20 - actually look at these different
00:21 - examples one by one and one of them is
00:23 - for creating these chains otherwise
00:26 - known as bodies connected by constraints
00:29 - and those constraints can be springy
00:31 - elastic constraints and so there's a lot
00:33 - of things you can build from this
00:35 - particular idea now another thing else
00:37 - to notice about this demo page which is
00:38 - great is that it actually has an
00:40 - interface for manipulating a lot of
00:42 - these particular variables so you know
00:44 - I've been kind of in the code just
00:45 - changing numbers and refreshing
00:47 - obviously building an interface to sort
00:49 - of tweak and test different values is
00:50 - much better and this is built in right
00:52 - from the demo page so what I'm going to
00:53 - do is essentially what I want to try to
00:55 - do is recreate exactly this a chain by
00:58 - connecting a bunch of these circular
00:59 - bodies by constraints and here's the
01:02 - thing so looking at the matter digest
01:05 - documentation and it actually has
01:06 - something called composites so
01:09 - composites are a composites module it
01:11 - says right here contains factory methods
01:13 - for creating composite bodies so this is
01:16 - what you can use actually I just want to
01:17 - have a change of things or won't have a
01:19 - stack of things and there's even a
01:20 - composite for a car which is really just
01:22 - like a couple shapes and some wheels
01:24 - maybe but here's the thing I'm going to
01:28 - do this video and make this tutorial
01:29 - without using the built in composites
01:31 - certainly is what I want is a chain
01:34 - using the built in composite chain like
01:37 - make this easier but I want to build
01:39 - this in a flexible way that I could kind
01:40 - of make anything you know I could make a
01:42 - chain and has branches coming out of it
01:44 - so I want to have total flexibility to
01:46 - see what happens if I individually
01:47 - create all the particles and constraints
01:50 - one by one and attach them in a
01:53 - completely customizable way maybe this
01:55 - is a bad idea but I'm going to give it a
01:57 - try ok so what do I need to do so the
02:03 - first thing just to sort of work that
02:05 - that so okay this is my program
02:06 - currently this is where I am all it does
02:09 - all it has is a single ground body
02:11 - the same Brown body that I've had in
02:13 - previous videos I also made a change
02:15 - from the previous videos where that
02:17 - circle object is now called particle but
02:19 - I haven't put any particles into the
02:21 - world I could however put one so I could
02:25 - say var P equals a new particle and I'm
02:28 - just going to make it at a 200 comma 100
02:32 - with a radius of 10 and then I could
02:36 - just say in draw P oh well it's actually
02:40 - pushing particles into an array so what
02:43 - happen is not defined oh yeah but Noah
02:46 - why should I be using that array so let
02:48 - me say particles dot push P and then let
02:53 - me actually iterate over that array with
02:56 - mine on for each loop and just say
03:03 - particles index I show so let me just
03:06 - get one thing so there's my one particle
03:08 - now I want to add a second one what I
03:12 - want to do is I'm gonna make that p1 and
03:16 - I'm going to say p2 is 200 150 and I'm
03:25 - going to push both of those into the
03:26 - array so there's two of them now these
03:31 - have no relationship they bounce off of
03:33 - each other and move apart what I want to
03:36 - do is I want to use something in matter
03:40 - chance and this exact same idea so it's
03:42 - called a constraint I didn't spell that
03:44 - right constraint like train is in there
03:47 - I think some whatever height I can just
03:50 - constrain it's called that in matter
03:53 - dodging but if I were in box 2d this
03:56 - would be called a joint if I were in
03:59 - toxic lives it would be called a spring
04:02 - so there's a lot of other terms for the
04:05 - same thing it's an entity that connects
04:07 - two bodies now it does not have any
04:09 - geometry so the idea is if there are two
04:12 - particles I want to be able to connect
04:14 - them with this thing called a constraint
04:16 - but one thing to note about the
04:18 - constraint is it doesn't have geometry
04:19 - so something will fall through it so
04:21 - there are other scenarios where what you
04:23 - might want to
04:24 - make like a bridge and but it's sort of
04:26 - like a springy bridge where you could
04:29 - what you could do is make a bunch of
04:30 - rectangular bodies that abut each other
04:32 - and then you could actually put
04:35 - connected with constraints but leaves
04:37 - very little space between them um so
04:39 - that's another scenario I could do in a
04:40 - coda challenge or something but here I
04:42 - just want to be able to attach these two
04:44 - bodies now this is always much more
04:46 - complex than you think
04:48 - because there's a lot of things I need
04:49 - to set I need to say body which which
04:55 - your body so body a and body B but also
04:58 - I did say where is the constraint
05:00 - attached is it at its center or you know
05:03 - I could I might want to do something
05:04 - like this where I kind of connect them
05:07 - from the edges so in a matter digest I
05:11 - pretty sure has a way of doing this and
05:13 - I think it's called point a and point B
05:17 - so there's the bodies and then the point
05:20 - is not the location of the constraint
05:22 - but the offset of the constraint
05:24 - relative to maybe the central point of
05:25 - the body then I also need usually a
05:27 - property called leg length which is
05:29 - often the rest length so you think about
05:32 - a spring you know if you pull out a
05:34 - spring it starts to bond and I'll wear
05:35 - well but eventually it comes to a rest
05:37 - so what is it sort of resting point
05:38 - where there will be no force either
05:41 - contracting or expanding it so if using
05:44 - the rest length there's also what else
05:46 - would there be maybe there's a kind of
05:48 - like strength torque option like how is
05:51 - it very rigid is it like a rubber band
05:52 - that type of thing so all just to make
05:55 - this single thing that connects the two
05:56 - bodies I need to set a lot of parameters
05:58 - so let's go try to do that over here
06:03 - okay so what I want to do is now I want
06:09 - to try to make a constraint
06:10 - so let's go look constraint I have that
06:14 - page open matter that constraint module
06:16 - contains methods for creating and
06:17 - manipulating constraints grenades are
06:19 - used to specify a fixed distance between
06:21 - two bodies model all the sorts of
06:23 - stiffness Springs or elastic so I think
06:25 - that's why one matter constraint create
06:28 - so I'm going to say I'm going to just
06:31 - make a variable called option then I
06:35 - want to say matter dot
06:37 - strengths create now what I what I could
06:41 - do here is say I could add another alias
06:45 - just constraint equals matter dot
06:47 - constraints right I think that's what I
06:50 - want here and then now I can just say
06:52 - I'm sorry constraint create so var
06:57 - completion here var constraint equals I
07:00 - want so now I'm just going to that word
07:03 - constraint the more you look at it the
07:04 - more it looks like it's spelled wrong I
07:06 - think it's right I want to create a
07:08 - constraint and with options so create
07:12 - options so I could certainly put the
07:17 - object with all the parameters right in
07:19 - here but I just want to have a separate
07:20 - object where I keep track of them so
07:21 - what are the options see what properties
07:25 - see property section below for detailed
07:27 - information on what you can pass via the
07:28 - options object properties body a body B
07:32 - ID label these are probably things to
07:35 - keep try that don't need length so these
07:36 - are things that I need so let's look to
07:38 - body a I want to connect p1 that's the
07:43 - first one oh but it's not p1 right my
07:46 - particle is my own object particles the
07:49 - body is the thing that matter cares
07:51 - about so P one's body to body be p2 body
07:57 - and then I also have point a which is
08:00 - that offset which I'm just going to make
08:03 - how do I set the offset the offset is an
08:06 - object maybe with an x and a y so I'm
08:10 - going to just have that offset be an X
08:13 - and the y of 0 it probably does that by
08:15 - default so actually let's just not put
08:18 - it in there but if I wanted to offset it
08:19 - differently I think I would put this in
08:20 - as an option and then a length is
08:25 - probably good so let's do a length let's
08:28 - let's give that as like 50 pixels
08:30 - between them and then what was the last
08:32 - one stiffness one means the constraint
08:36 - is very stiff 0.2 means it acts like a
08:39 - soft spring so let's try that stiffness
08:42 - let's try like point three four
08:47 - so now i assuming what i then have to do
08:50 - is through world dot add world comma
08:55 - constraints so i've also got to tell the
08:58 - physics engine to put that constraint in
09:00 - the world so now I've created a
09:01 - constraint between those two bodies with
09:04 - a specific rest length and a stiffness
09:06 - I've created it and I put it in the
09:08 - world so now let's run it Brooks
09:13 - constraint oh because it is spelled
09:15 - wrong the more you look at it the more
09:17 - if you got to spell bronze because I saw
09:19 - her on country yeah that's why I spelled
09:23 - it up so let's see look at dad well so
09:27 - you can see that that constraint now
09:29 - let's let's let's offset it a little bit
09:32 - so we can maybe see more what's going on
09:34 - there we go
09:35 - so you can kind of get the feeling like
09:38 - secure constraint together now the thing
09:40 - is I can't see anything but I could draw
09:43 - a line between them so now in draw I
09:47 - could do something like line this is a
09:51 - terrible way to do it particles zero dot
09:54 - dot body dot position this is like the
09:58 - worst thing I could ever possibly do
10:00 - right draw a line between this first one
10:03 - x and y whoops and the second one's x
10:09 - and y and let's see what we get here now
10:16 - I've got a line so you can sort of see
10:18 - now it sort of feels more like it's
10:20 - working so this is the whole thing again
10:22 - I can't say this enough about physics
10:24 - engines there's the actual physics and
10:26 - then there's what you're drawing mostly
10:28 - you want those things to match but
10:30 - sometimes you maybe want to not reveal
10:33 - what's connecting what or maybe you want
10:35 - to draw that in a different way so
10:36 - there's a lot of possibilities how do
10:38 - you think about it so now here's the
10:40 - thing what I actually want to do is
10:42 - create a chain of these so there's a
10:47 - bunch of different ways we could think
10:48 - about approaching this but let's just
10:50 - build with what we have so first of all
10:52 - this idea of creating two separate
10:54 - particles and pushing them and then
10:55 - creating this constraint here I need a
10:57 - kind of loop
10:58 - to do this and again I could use the
11:00 - built-in natural gas composite but I'm
11:03 - going to I'm going to be stubborn here
11:05 - and do this in my own way so I'm gonna
11:07 - say far let's think of it as going let's
11:09 - actually have it go horizontally so
11:11 - let's start at an X at like 20 pixels
11:14 - let's have X go all the way to you know
11:17 - the width minus 20 which is like 380 and
11:20 - then I'm going to go I'm going to go
11:22 - every 20 pixels so every 20 pixels and
11:28 - I'm going to comment a lot of this stuff
11:30 - out I want to create a particle at X
11:35 - comma 100 so I want to put a whole row a
11:39 - row of particles across there we go now
11:43 - ignore the fact that that line is drawn
11:45 - there there's no I'm going to I'm going
11:49 - to where where is that line drawn let's
11:51 - take that out comment that out and
11:55 - that's a lot that's a lot of stuff let's
11:58 - let's let's move every 40 pixels okay
12:04 - great so we can see here there's a whole
12:06 - bunch of things now we're not really
12:07 - it's there's not a lot of interplay here
12:09 - because they're all perfectly falling so
12:11 - it's almost like there is a constraint
12:14 - but let's change this now so what do I
12:17 - want to do I want to also make a
12:20 - constraint and what I want is for I want
12:27 - to say var P and then I want to save our
12:29 - previous equals particles oh looks ok
12:35 - let's create let's create a variable
12:37 - before the loop called previous and it's
12:41 - going to be equal to no then after I
12:45 - create that particle and in theory
12:48 - creates a constraint I'm going to say
12:49 - previous is equal to P so what I want to
12:53 - do is I want to connect each particles
12:56 - with the previous one that's all I want
12:59 - to do so every time I go through this
13:01 - loop make a particle at it and connect
13:03 - it to the previous one however I don't
13:05 - want to do that for the first one right
13:07 - so I do want to say only do this if if
13:11 - previous exists
13:12 - so only make this constraint if previous
13:15 - exists so now if I were to do that we
13:18 - could see look at this it's kind of you
13:20 - can see well they're definitely
13:21 - connected there's a constraint and
13:23 - they're all like moving along
13:25 - that's what now so that's pretty good
13:27 - now here's the thing what if I were to
13:30 - allow what if I were to allow one of
13:34 - them to be static so I could say I could
13:37 - I could add an artless static the bat is
13:41 - a keyword in JavaScript so let me what's
13:43 - another word I can use for static fixed
13:46 - so I'm going to say is static fixed so I
13:51 - could pass in you know I could say here
13:58 - like if there is no previous make a
14:04 - let's see trying to think of like
14:07 - there's like I just want the first one
14:10 - in this kind of I'm doing this it's
14:12 - probably there's a nicer way to do this
14:14 - I'm sure but let's just say let's just
14:19 - say fixed equals false so I'm going to
14:22 - pass in there's none of them are fixed
14:24 - but if previous if not previous then
14:32 - fixed equals fixed equals true so I'm
14:37 - just going to make the first one there's
14:39 - no previous then I want it to be fixed
14:40 - so if I do this whoops
14:42 - I've got an error on particle judges
14:45 - line number five which is oh there needs
14:49 - to be a comma here because I add another
14:51 - property and there we go so you can see
14:53 - that first one is fixed so what I also
14:57 - want to do is now I'm just going to like
14:59 - kind of change where they are I'm going
15:02 - to start this one in I'm going to start
15:06 - it more in the center and maybe I'll add
15:10 - more of them but make them smaller and
15:13 - do something like this so you can see
15:14 - whoa and maybe that rest length should
15:17 - actually be something more like 20 and
15:22 - there we go so now you can see there's
15:24 - what I was kind of looking
15:26 - do I created this idea of a chain that
15:29 - are all connected and if I made it much
15:32 - longer like if I went all the way up to
15:34 - 600 to add even more right you're going
15:37 - to see it's going to kind of even it's
15:40 - going to collide with the ground and
15:42 - kind of stop there that's sort of weird
15:43 - oh you know what it went through the
15:46 - bottom because the bottom it's around
15:48 - the bottom because the bottom doesn't
15:49 - extend past the screen so anyway you
15:51 - this could be obviously fixed in a lot
15:55 - of ways but let's just leave it a bit so
15:56 - this is what I was attempting to do now
15:58 - here's the thing there's a lot of
16:00 - improvements that I could make for this
16:03 - potentially number one is you know I've
16:10 - kind of got a lot of code just in the
16:12 - weeds here in the main program so in the
16:15 - same way that I had this idea of
16:16 - encapsulating this idea of a matter KS
16:19 - particle a body into an object that
16:21 - keeps track of its own body and other
16:23 - things I could now make a chain object
16:25 - and it's chain is an object that keeps
16:27 - tracking an array of particles and those
16:29 - constraints also the way that I'm
16:31 - created these constraints I didn't you
16:33 - know I didn't the same way I wrapped the
16:34 - body into a particle I could wrap a
16:36 - constraint into a spring so I could
16:38 - write my own show function so I could
16:40 - draw lines between those things that
16:42 - might be a bit more interesting you know
16:45 - and so you know because maybe what I
16:48 - actually want to do is is render this in
16:50 - a different way so there's a lot of
16:51 - possible ways but this hopefully gives
16:52 - you the basic idea now the thing that I
16:54 - want to add in the next videos how can I
16:56 - actually click on this and drag it
16:58 - around so and and you know the other
17:02 - thing that you I might think about doing
17:03 - is what if I were to connect them from
17:05 - the left to the right and then make it a
17:07 - kind of bridge that things fall in kind
17:09 - of restaurant so that would be another
17:10 - thing to maybe try play with the spring
17:12 - value so many things you try here so
17:14 - hopefully this shows you how constraints
17:16 - work in matter chess to give you a basic
17:19 - idea of what you could do and in the
17:20 - next video I'm going to add a mouse
17:22 - constraint see you there
17:28 - you
