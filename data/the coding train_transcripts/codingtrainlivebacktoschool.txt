04:02 - oh boy
04:04 - this might be something of a disaster
04:05 - today i should warn everybody in advance
04:09 - i got a lot of new tech going here and
04:11 - i'm gonna play the next song i'm gonna
04:14 - switch the camera
04:16 - to me in about one minute
04:19 - um
04:21 - oh i need my headphone
04:25 - i'm walking around
04:26 - here looking
04:30 - for
04:31 - [Music]
04:33 - okay ah here i found a
04:35 - headphone ah i stepped on something oh
04:37 - that hurts
04:40 - [Music]

04:44 - professional setup
04:46 - okay
04:53 - okay now
05:01 - oh my goodness i think
05:04 - i think i might be ready to go here i'm
05:06 - switching to me
05:08 - hi well i might be brighter good morning
05:12 - oh is it the morning it's 10 37 a.m
05:15 - welcome this is the coding train
05:18 - with me your host daniel
05:21 - schiffman
05:25 - with the train whistle
05:28 - it doesn't work very well let's check to
05:30 - see if my whiteboard camera is working
05:33 - almost no chance of this yeah that's not
05:36 - that's not a positive sign i guess i
05:38 - will not be demonstrating that today uh
05:41 - welcome um i'm i'm having a bit of a
05:43 - slow start um
05:45 - as some of you might be aware um i am in
05:48 - a new studio i'm in a garage it's quite
05:51 - a large space i wonder how the echo is
05:54 - right now i've got some i've i've been
05:56 - buying a lot of new stuff i've got a new
05:58 - light
06:00 - which i would love to show you but look
06:02 - the camera that i'm gonna do some behind
06:04 - the scenes stuff at some point i've got
06:06 - a new light i've got another new light
06:07 - that i didn't set up yet i've got some
06:09 - sound blankets to help with the echo
06:11 - i've got sound foam that i need to put
06:14 - maybe on the ceiling that will also help
06:17 - um
06:18 - and uh hello to italy uh says alex uh in
06:22 - the chat
06:23 - uh
06:24 - bon giorno did i get that anywhere close
06:27 - the correct ciao okay maybe that's a
06:29 - little bit ah i think there's a dead
06:31 - cicada on the ground over here i'm kind
06:33 - of in a semi-outdoor space which is sort
06:36 - of fun gloria pickle my lovely pup is
06:39 - over there sitting in the grass i can
06:40 - see her out of the corner of my eye
06:45 - i think this might be a total disaster
06:46 - of a stream but uh
06:48 - it is still sponsored so oh let me go
06:51 - over here and say uh thank you before i
06:53 - forget to the sponsor of today's coding
06:56 - train stream uh brilliant brilliant is
06:59 - like the place on the internet where i
07:02 - love to just soak up and learn lots of
07:04 - new stuff uh in many interactive lessons
07:07 - computer science physics
07:09 - there's this course called beautiful
07:10 - geometry which is amazing it's going to
07:12 - be lots of ideas of things to code in p5
07:15 - you can sign up for free at
07:16 - brilliant.org
07:18 - codingtrain
07:19 - um and if you want to unlock all of
07:22 - their uh courses and features um if you
07:25 - go through that link you will get 20 off
07:28 - the first 200 people to do so we'll get
07:29 - 20 off from the coding train i've been
07:31 - buying a lot of new equipment it's
07:33 - expensive and so by signing up by going
07:35 - to that link you're kind of helping me
07:37 - out and kind of keeping the train
07:38 - running here
07:40 - uh all right let me go back to this view
07:42 - um
07:44 - so um one thing that's a little bit
07:46 - tricky right now is that i am on a new
07:50 - home internet connection
07:52 - uh back when i was in uh streaming from
07:55 - brooklyn new york i had a fiber
07:57 - connection which was fairly reliable and
07:59 - high speed i have paid for the most
08:01 - expensive internet that i could get
08:04 - but out here um
08:06 - there is no fiber uh there's a lot of
08:09 - there's not that's just like not as much
08:11 - uh internet
08:13 - so it's a little touch and go um
08:16 - but let's see how it goes today if i
08:18 - have to come up with a different
08:19 - solution i shall
08:21 - um
08:22 - you know i had really hoped to be up and
08:25 - running more quickly
08:28 - i don't know if this is really going to
08:29 - come into fruition but i'm putting this
08:30 - into the universe
08:32 - january 2022 this is really where
08:37 - the coding train we're going to add some
08:38 - cars we're gonna add new the schedule is
08:42 - gonna be more frequent
08:44 - um so i'm uh with moving setting up a
08:48 - new studio i am teaching at nyu
08:51 - my my day job
08:53 - three courses this semester i will talk
08:55 - about those because coding train runs
08:57 - parallel with my um university teaching
09:00 - i've got a lot of commitments going on
09:02 - in the next few months my children
09:04 - though they're at school right now at
09:06 - this present time they're at school and
09:08 - they don't come home from school till
09:10 - later in the afternoon so that's
09:12 - certainly opened up quite a bit of time
09:14 - for me but i will be on sabbatical this
09:16 - spring and we'll see maybe i've got some
09:18 - maybe i'll i should be doing something
09:20 - else on sabbatical it's kind of unclear
09:23 - but part of setting up this new studio
09:24 - and and moving to this new place with
09:26 - this garage hoping to really make this
09:28 - my everyday workspace
09:30 - um to do a lot more coding train stuff
09:33 - and maybe other creative coding and
09:34 - other projects i don't know maybe i
09:37 - could start streaming other kinds of
09:39 - tutorials
09:40 - i uh beard trimming tutorials coffee
09:44 - pour over tutorials i'm trying to think
09:45 - i actually don't know about those things
09:47 - it's really nothing that i'm an expert
09:49 - in so sorry
09:51 - uh but that's coming so it's a slow
09:53 - start awkward start but i am here um
09:56 - part of today oh chris sears
10:00 - how is this even possible right's over
10:02 - here in my chat it's not my chat but in
10:05 - the discord member chat
10:07 - i'm teaching seven courses this semester
10:12 - that that blows my mind i don't even
10:14 - understand how that is humanly possible
10:17 - you my friend or a hero
10:20 - um
10:22 - school not cool you don't have a watch
10:24 - yeah i don't i don't really need
10:26 - the watch uh see soarin moderator soarin
10:29 - thank you for being a coding trained
10:31 - moderator in the chat um so let's see
10:34 - let me just try this one more time
10:35 - what's the chance
10:36 - that this has uh
10:39 - um come alive no okay
10:42 - so i don't have a plan for today i was
10:44 - kind of thinking well let me look at
10:45 - what courses i'm teaching make a plan
10:47 - let me look at some of my older plans
10:49 - simon reminded me
10:52 - i'm going to come over to this here for
10:53 - a second
10:55 - and i probably shouldn't do this but i'm
10:57 - going to go here to
11:00 - github.com codingtrain
11:05 - is it raining
11:06 - i hope it doesn't start raining because
11:08 - then poor gloria is going to get quite
11:09 - wet
11:12 - uh coding train
11:14 - uh
11:15 - rainbow topics i think
11:18 - is the name of the repository
11:24 - um where i kind of
11:27 - so this is the thing
11:29 - it's so true oh
11:31 - so true sound is much better than the
11:32 - last time so that's probably just the
11:34 - lav mic
11:35 - uh
11:38 - this space prefers the lav mic over
11:41 - uh have this i have this mic which i
11:42 - really do like i would i would certainly
11:44 - recommend it i don't want to unplug it
11:46 - it shouldn't be plugged in
11:47 - can you see it no where's the camera um
11:49 - it's like a elgato wave
11:52 - not not yet a sponsor but someday maybe
11:55 - um so a simon really rightfully pointed
11:58 - this out to me that
12:00 - i have this habit of at the beginning of
12:02 - every semester making a new markdown
12:05 - file with kind and i duplicate the
12:07 - previous ones and go through a list
12:09 - of stuff that i want to work on
12:12 - and uh
12:14 - apparently i never actually do anything
12:17 - but make the list
12:19 - so let's just look at the summer 2020 i
12:21 - won't make a new list today that's i
12:23 - guess i you know what is it the
12:24 - definition of insanity is doing the same
12:26 - thing yeah you can see like i don't
12:27 - think i've done any of these things that
12:29 - are on the list i didn't move
12:32 - this summer and i've been really working
12:34 - hard to try to keep the nature of code
12:36 - video tutorials coming out so i hope you
12:38 - don't all feel like i'm not doing
12:40 - anything i am doing stuff i'm trying
12:44 - um
12:45 - but um yeah i can see i think like all
12:47 - of these still apply so absolutely no
12:50 - point in remaking this list the cabana
12:54 - is no longer a thing it might return
12:57 - but i i do have dreams of making videos
12:59 - in a sort of different style
13:02 - like those cabana videos um uh yeah so
13:07 - these are i haven't done any of these
13:10 - yeah so great so all this stuff
13:13 - um has not nothing has been oh discord
13:16 - bot stuff
13:18 - that yeah i haven't done any of this
13:22 - so i have an idea
13:24 - this is gonna be fun ready all right
13:25 - everybody you're gonna be amazed
13:28 - watch
13:29 - what i'm about to do for you
13:31 - i'm gonna click this edit button
13:34 - i'm gonna
13:35 - type
13:36 - i don't have access to this project hold
13:38 - on
13:42 - what's going on here ah so i forgot that
13:44 - i made this very silly i attempted to
13:47 - make a youtube short
13:49 - um i don't know if anyone actually
13:52 - watched my youtube short
13:54 - i got some complaints about like why are
13:57 - you making youtube short
13:59 - not not not for you my friend um some
14:02 - people liked it uh but i i made a
14:04 - separate um github account
14:07 - um so maybe what i need to do is go back
14:11 - to
14:12 - um my
14:14 - myself sign in
14:17 - i don't know this might be a total fail
14:19 - whoa okay oh all right i'll take it
14:23 - oh no authentication code and guess
14:25 - where my
14:26 - uh
14:27 - oh i could you know what maybe i could
14:29 - get a code sent to my backup phone
14:32 - number would that help
14:33 - no okay so one issue is
14:36 - everything is a fail today oh my
14:38 - goodness this doesn't work all right
14:40 - this is good i'm gonna get my
14:41 - authentication code
14:44 - and i'll be right back
14:48 - i mean i'm not going to be very far and
14:49 - you're going to hear me the entire time
14:50 - but i'm just going to put on this sound
14:51 - i'll leave this here i'm walking to the
14:54 - side
14:55 - i'm still in a physical space where i'm
14:57 - going over to my phone which is
14:59 - tethered to the computer
15:01 - using something called elgatocam which
15:03 - totally does not work
15:05 - apparently authenticator
15:08 - looking for github
15:11 - okay i gotta memorize this in my head
15:12 - but not tell you the numbers and the
15:15 - dial is going down oh my god it's almost
15:16 - gonna run out of time
15:21 - okay
15:23 - am i gonna get it in time
15:25 - verifying yes i did it
15:30 - now
15:31 - um
15:32 - [Music]
15:36 - coming back here
15:38 - now let me see
15:41 - let me see if i oh yeah that
15:44 - the auto focus causes the desk to dance
15:46 - yeah by the way most of this i just want
15:48 - to say that most of this live stream is
15:50 - me just trying to like figure out this
15:52 - new studio but hopefully as i do this
15:56 - today and get further along more
15:58 - interesting stuff will happen
16:01 - there is a
16:03 - very dead cicada on the ground here i am
16:06 - entirely barefoot i hope you can see
16:08 - that
16:10 - uh i've got some nice rugs here
16:12 - and i'm really afraid of stepping on it
16:14 - i feel like i should do like having like
16:15 - a small little burial for it and
16:18 - say uh cicada
16:20 - say i i mean okay
16:24 - let's see there's got to be something
16:25 - here that's appropriate
16:28 - uh let me see
16:31 - no
16:34 - i want to say something
16:36 - i want to talk about the cicada over
16:38 - here
16:40 - that is lying on the floor
16:42 - cicada i don't know that i ever met you
16:44 - when you were alive but i hear your
16:46 - sounds every night
16:48 - as i walk gloria in the darkness and
16:50 - looking up at the stars and i i hope
16:52 - that you
16:53 - [Music]
16:56 - this is really happening right now
16:59 - okay i'll be right back what was i doing
17:01 - i was gonna see if i get that camera to
17:02 - work ah yes the ipad stand
17:05 - hmm
17:07 - i do have a guy
17:08 - i have four cats two are up for adoption
17:11 - someone in the chat mark booth said get
17:14 - a cat
17:15 - you're gonna be sorry you
17:16 - made that comment in a second all right
17:18 - i'm coming right back
17:22 - all right here i am
17:25 - come on epoch cam
17:27 - there's no reason why it worked all
17:29 - morning
17:30 - and then i wonder if i have to like be
17:33 - in the thing so it's like activated
17:35 - maybe i should be a little more patient
17:38 - here
17:39 - i'm gonna do this like maybe i actually
17:41 - have to leave this here
17:44 - like open
17:45 - for a short bit
17:48 - okay hold on
18:05 - all right everybody
18:09 - i guess it's really not gonna work
18:13 - [Music]
18:16 - up and down and up and down they never
18:21 - load they never load loading
18:25 - the musical broadway's back open
18:28 - when will my time be i will somehow make
18:33 - it on the stage
18:35 - [Music]
18:37 - of coding all right um
18:40 - now
18:41 - i um
18:43 - i want to talk about cats
18:46 - the brooklyn cat cafe is a non-profit
18:48 - cat cafe in new york city cat adoption
18:50 - center and social space
18:53 - all volunteer 501 c 3 organization i am
18:56 - currently my family is currently
18:57 - fostering
18:59 - uh
19:00 - where are they i'm looking for ruby
19:03 - and loki
19:05 - because anyone see ruby
19:08 - ruby
19:10 - ruby and loki here we go
19:13 - i'm gonna you you know especially you
19:15 - know you want to adopt these cute lovely
19:17 - kitties there's loki and there's ruby
19:21 - ruby is amazing oh my god the littlest
19:24 - tiniest
19:25 - creature
19:26 - um and so um
19:29 - they're sweet and relaxed pair of
19:30 - kittens who can't wait to look his most
19:31 - handsome and floofy brown taffy over
19:33 - mead will melt as soon as you pick him
19:34 - up for pets and scratches he purrs like
19:36 - so loud
19:40 - ruby is a sweet curious tiny jewel of a
19:42 - kitty look i love them very much
19:44 - but we already have two cats
19:46 - and four cats is a lot
19:50 - so i'm hoping that somebody will be very
19:52 - excited to adopt them um you can uh i
19:55 - have nothing to do with the adoption
19:56 - process i am my family is just fostering
19:58 - them uh contact the brooklyn cat cafe i
20:01 - don't know maybe you uh um and if you're
20:03 - interested that's not what you're here
20:05 - for so but you know someone did mention
20:08 - uh cats in the chat all right so
20:11 - we've established
20:13 - we've established that i am a very
20:15 - disorganized person who live streams for
20:17 - enormous amounts of time doing
20:19 - absolutely nothing and that some amount
20:21 - of people continue to watch
20:24 - i'm viewership might be going down but
20:26 - you know
20:28 - c'est la vie
20:30 - um
20:35 - bookmark your cats yeah so um
20:39 - i'm trying to set up a new studio my
20:41 - goal
20:43 - a couple things i've i've let's talk
20:44 - about news coding train news
20:54 - breaking news
20:58 - okay so it's not really breaking news
21:00 - because it's all stuff that's repeat but
21:02 - i'm it's telling you this will give you
21:04 - a sense of what's to come and it will
21:06 - help me sort of like think about what it
21:07 - is that's happening that i'm doing so
21:10 - big project
21:11 - probably won't launch until the end of
21:13 - this year early 2022 brand new coding
21:16 - train website um one thing actually i
21:18 - wonder if i can like quickly put up a
21:20 - poll
21:22 - uh and bet
21:24 - what language are you going to get today
21:27 - the language of babel rambling babble
21:30 - that's the language i'm coding in today
21:32 - maybe the poll is kind of unnecessary
21:35 - here uh what i wanted what i wanted to
21:37 - say and we can i'm not actually so first
21:38 - of all you should join the discord
21:40 - um where's that button which pastes a
21:43 - link because i will be having official
21:46 - polls
21:47 - and
21:48 - okay why is
21:49 - itunes is trying to install itself
21:52 - finish okay um great
21:56 - so you should join the discord because
21:57 - that right now i'm going to do an uh
21:59 - sort of like anecdotal poll i'm just
22:01 - going to take your temperature and talk
22:02 - through something that i'm really
22:03 - struggling with
22:05 - um
22:06 - and uh i will soon release this as a
22:10 - google form
22:11 - in the discord itself for everybody to
22:14 - vote on to get your feedback on so one
22:16 - of the things i'm trying to think about
22:18 - with the new website
22:20 - is language and oh you don't see the
22:23 - website this is the old website the
22:24 - current website it's not old it is
22:26 - actively present and new and wonderful
22:29 - but we're making some upgrades
22:32 - you can see here there are various
22:34 - headings like challenges and beginners
22:37 - and learning and more and et cetera et
22:40 - cetera et cetera so for example
22:43 - um
22:45 - what what is the what is the
22:48 - best kind of language to use for
22:50 - organizing all the content on the
22:52 - website is it very sort of literal dry
22:56 - this is what it is beginner
22:59 - how to code in peop you know beginner
23:02 - tutorials
23:03 - uh coding challenges
23:06 - uh machine learning lessons i don't know
23:09 - or
23:10 - would the website be more fun and
23:12 - approachable and would you be able to
23:13 - navigate and understand what's going on
23:15 - you know i want to have a very welcoming
23:17 - and inclusive and kind of playful
23:19 - quality to it if there were more train
23:22 - themed things like these are the tracks
23:24 - and these are the
23:26 - train cars and over here in the cafe car
23:28 - you can join the discord to chat so this
23:31 - is one of the things i'm struggling with
23:33 - i'm so i'm going to be putting out a
23:35 - survey for all sorts of kinds of naming
23:37 - ideas
23:38 - [Music]
23:39 - if you are a writer also you know you
23:42 - know i think i don't really have anyone
23:44 - at present i mean maybe that's not true
23:46 - but i'm also maybe looking for someone
23:48 - to help collaborate on this to sort of
23:49 - think about a style guide for all the
23:51 - language and the descriptions and that
23:53 - kind of thing so um i mean that maybe
23:55 - that's on me to really work on more but
23:57 - that's so that's
23:58 - news item number one new website it's
24:01 - active an active project i will be maybe
24:03 - sharing
24:04 - uh rough versions of it doing we you
24:06 - know already put out i had volunteers to
24:08 - do some preliminary user testing of some
24:10 - of the designs so your path to getting
24:13 - those sneak peeks and previews is the
24:15 - discord of course if you join as a
24:16 - member you also you might get some other
24:19 - sneak peeks and previews that i will be
24:21 - sharing as well
24:22 - so
24:23 - uh karaoke is in the uh chat hello nice
24:26 - to see you
24:28 - um
24:29 - oh yes and the discord link actually can
24:32 - be updated to discord dot gg
24:35 - coding train because we now have a
24:37 - vanity url because as we all know i am a
24:40 - very vain person
24:42 - i mean it's true i mean
24:44 - i could be making all these video
24:45 - tutorials without me in them and yet i
24:47 - choose to put me in them every single
24:49 - day of the week so what are you going to
24:51 - do it's who i am it's what i am um
24:55 - i heard a noise
24:58 - it's it's it's my dog it's okay i heard
25:01 - an animal and i got a little bit afraid
25:02 - i think there are some bears around here
25:04 - not probably wandering into the garage
25:06 - in the middle of the day but
25:07 - um yeah
25:10 - thank you soren for posting that now um
25:16 - um
25:17 - all right so
25:22 - that was that's my website item number
25:24 - one
25:26 - i had some other things in my head when
25:27 - i started this
25:29 - news oh yeah so
25:31 - i'm also trying to figure out the right
25:33 - balance between
25:36 - live streaming and um what you're
25:39 - watching right now and
25:41 - uh more polished sort of recorded video
25:44 - tutorials and um that follows certain
25:47 - sequences as well as new coding
25:49 - challenges because
25:50 - you know as many of you probably my like
25:52 - ability to produce content has severely
25:54 - slowed down i think in some
25:58 - some aspects the quality has greatly
26:01 - improved i'm always and i've been
26:03 - getting very positive feedback about
26:05 - extra diagram and animation elements and
26:09 - you know quicker editing that lets you
26:12 - watch the videos
26:14 - more quickly frankly
26:16 - and have
26:18 - different visuals that help you step
26:21 - through and understand the concepts
26:23 - um but i don't know to what extent
26:25 - um
26:26 - but i'm trying to figure out it it's a
26:28 - tricky balance now how uh you know i
26:30 - could have instead of live streaming
26:32 - today i could have just started
26:33 - recording some more coding challenges
26:36 - but i used to do the coding challenges
26:37 - in live streams and people really like
26:39 - that i don't know i don't know how to do
26:40 - any of this i'm lost and so
26:43 - uh i think if i make it to january that
26:46 - sounds very um ominous but as i plan to
26:49 - make it to january
26:50 - i will have multiple days in the week so
26:52 - maybe i can start to do all of these
26:54 - things
26:55 - um but um i think this would be a good
26:57 - time
26:58 - um since i have no plan um and i just
27:01 - thought of it too
27:04 - [Music]
27:06 - wrong track
27:08 - to talk about
27:10 - and show
27:11 - some
27:13 - uh community contributions so one of my
27:15 - favorite things and one of the things
27:16 - that i'm really hoping will make its way
27:19 - into the new website it's very loud for
27:21 - me
27:22 - um
27:23 - is hopefully it's not too loud for you
27:26 - um our ways of featuring what viewers of
27:29 - the coding train are making
27:32 - so that you can share with each other so
27:33 - you can share with me and that everybody
27:35 - can be inspired and and and welcomed
27:38 - into participating so let's take a look
27:40 - i honestly have not looked at this at
27:42 - all let's go to um
27:45 - this page
27:46 - and i want to look at some bezier curve
27:50 - community contributions i think some new
27:52 - ones have come in i certainly look i
27:55 - feel like i looked at some of these
27:56 - maybe i haven't looked it does anyone
27:58 - remember if i looked at any of these in
28:00 - a previous live stream
28:03 - uh speaking of which though what is a
28:05 - bezier curve so my new trick
28:09 - that i am about to try
28:11 - and see how this goes i do have i really
28:14 - prefer
28:14 - to use a physical whiteboard i like the
28:18 - ability to gesture to draw to move
28:21 - around to erase
28:23 - but it's um i don't have a second camera
28:25 - where i am right now i tried setting up
28:27 - my phones and connecting it and so it's
28:29 - not really working i need some more
28:31 - lights to try to light the whiteboard
28:33 - area but also there might be some value
28:35 - in me doing diagrams that can be
28:38 - captured and replayed and stored so
28:42 - what i have for you today
28:44 - uh is
28:47 - um i mean it's it's an ipad i have one
28:50 - of these uh oh it's like invisible
28:51 - pencils
28:53 - um and i think and i this is procreate
28:56 - which someone recommended to me i've no
28:57 - idea how to use it
28:59 - i don't know if anybody knows or you
29:00 - have your favorite drawing app but what
29:02 - i want to do
29:04 - is kind of
29:05 - look at and diagram what is a bezier
29:09 - curve
29:11 - this is like a very weird
29:14 - um
29:16 - this is a very weird um
29:20 - like pen thing that i'm on
29:22 - sketching inking drawing airbrushing
29:25 - textures abstract charcoals elements
29:27 - spray paints touch-ups
29:29 - luminance what do i want i just want
29:30 - drawing
29:32 - um
29:34 - but i just kind of want like a
29:35 - whiteboard marker is that like this
29:38 - ooh no no no oh that's nice though
29:42 - okay
29:43 - and now hold on how do i
29:45 - can i go to here and just make like a
29:47 - new thing
29:49 - do this
29:50 - all right
29:52 - and then procreate is the best okay so
29:54 - that's good
29:56 - uh i use this app procreate okay great
29:58 - so maybe um can somebody tell me
30:01 - what for just like a very basic pen i
30:03 - should use
30:05 - not a painting
30:07 - painting brush could work no like
30:08 - drawing is what i'm doing
30:11 - but what is just
30:12 - or am i inking
30:14 - maybe i'm inking oh yeah there we go gel
30:16 - pen studio pen marker
30:19 - marker is what but i guess i want
30:21 - something maybe a little smaller so
30:22 - let's try this gel pen
30:25 - oh yeah
30:26 - this is right
30:27 - i just wrote my name that was very
30:29 - exciting
30:30 - two fingers touch is for undo
30:33 - look at that
30:34 - that is cool
30:36 - uh and then this is like probably
30:38 - thickness
30:39 - it doesn't get very uh and so i kind of
30:42 - want it maybe something a little bit
30:43 - thicker
30:46 - gel pen studio pen marker let's try
30:49 - marker again
30:51 - and then i assume i can
30:54 - pick a color somewhere is that like this
30:56 - no whoa what does this do
30:59 - i have no idea
31:01 - okay bezier curve so let me just
31:03 - practice
31:04 - what this would be like if i'm doing
31:06 - um a little uh lesson
31:09 - okay uh bezier whoops
31:14 - i think i made it some weird color
31:17 - where's the color
31:20 - is it this oh yeah there we go
31:23 - uh
31:24 - like what if i just want
31:26 - that
31:28 - there we go
31:33 - okay uh bezier
31:36 - so i also need a much more stable stand
31:40 - i need a much more stable stand because
31:43 - um
31:46 - is moving around a lot as i draw so what
31:47 - i don't like about this is i'm looking
31:50 - down over here which probably doesn't
31:52 - bother you but as i'm drawing then i
31:54 - have to turn i'd much rather be doing
31:56 - this right
31:58 - but um
32:00 - anyway
32:01 - uh so a bezier curve
32:03 - is a particular kind of curve that
32:07 - involves interpolation and as i
32:09 - discussed in my video about bezier
32:11 - curves
32:12 - uh you know technically a um
32:17 - we have a quadratic a cubic and uh what
32:19 - was the what's the first one called i'm
32:20 - completely blanking on this
32:22 - um
32:24 - uh but you know this this is the bezier
32:26 - curve if it just has two two anchor
32:28 - points
32:29 - um it's just a line between those two
32:31 - points
32:33 - but a quadratic bezier curve
32:36 - involves a control point
32:39 - and that control point
32:42 - as you move it causes the curve to bend
32:46 - linear that's what i'm of course i was
32:48 - like it couldn't possibly be linear
32:50 - right that's so obvious um so now
32:54 - oh it's a lot of undo there if i were to
32:56 - add a second control point
32:58 - then
32:59 - that causes the curve to bend down here
33:01 - and up here et cetera so but so by the
33:04 - way this is me just practicing trying to
33:06 - explain stuff with diagrams
33:10 - so and this is uh cubic
33:16 - smiley face
33:18 - oh i could draw this could be like a cat
33:20 - with like some whiskers
33:24 - how's this going everybody
33:26 - so uh my uh video
33:29 - uh it where i uh use an actual
33:31 - whiteboard and show some code examples
33:34 - and talk through everything there is to
33:35 - be on betsy carson this is one of the
33:36 - more popular videos that i've recently
33:39 - released um at least initially videos
33:42 - have these very strange lives to them so
33:45 - um
33:47 - they get a sort of burst of viewership
33:48 - when i first released them and sometimes
33:51 - that burst of viewership kind of takes
33:53 - off in a pretty
33:55 - strong way bezier curve video being
33:58 - quite a good example of that but still
34:00 - um usually if even if it's doing really
34:03 - well in its sort of initial burst
34:04 - somewhere between like 50 and 100 000
34:06 - views which is tremendous i'm very
34:08 - thrilled with that um other videos
34:10 - like the wander video i recently
34:12 - released which is i'll get to next which
34:14 - is like in the middle of a sequence of
34:16 - many videos they don't tend to take off
34:18 - with that kind of burst whatever youtube
34:21 - magic is happening
34:22 - um
34:24 - it's just not picked up as much but then
34:26 - strangely
34:28 - videos that i have will just a year
34:30 - later or two years later
34:32 - sometimes like take on this life of
34:34 - their own and so the example of what's
34:36 - happening right now is a star let me
34:39 - search for like this a star coding train
34:40 - video um this one is just like
34:43 - consistent this is from 2017 is
34:46 - consistently the most pop viewed video
34:48 - right now every week every day on my
34:50 - channel it might have come down i
34:52 - haven't actually looked in like
34:53 - maybe like three or four days but um
34:56 - this is also pretty interesting that the
34:58 - search for this video is actually this i
35:00 - don't think these are tied to
35:02 - well maybe i don't i don't believe these
35:04 - older videos are time coded
35:06 - um code the title coding challenge has
35:09 - something to do with that that's
35:10 - interesting yeah and i i often think
35:13 - that what i probably should do is have
35:14 - and i don't want to do this
35:16 - but like if i were trying to optimize
35:18 - towards the strongest viewership
35:21 - i would actually just have a channel
35:24 - that's only the coding challenges so
35:26 - that people could subscribe only to that
35:28 - and that youtube's understanding of my
35:31 - content would be like oh people like
35:33 - every video because what happens is i
35:35 - release a coding challenge it's like
35:36 - recommended more and more and then i do
35:38 - one that's like i think really important
35:40 - and part of a sequence but it doesn't
35:41 - get as much viewership so then the next
35:43 - coding challenge is like well people
35:45 - aren't as interested anymore so maybe
35:46 - it'll be a little bit less it's like
35:47 - this never-ending cycle um i i'm trying
35:49 - not to be obsessed with this stuff you
35:51 - know it's it's really not the primary my
35:54 - primary sort of incentive or motivation
35:57 - but it's so hard not to get caught up in
36:00 - it and i understand that for other
36:01 - people
36:02 - um you know who are doing this youtube
36:04 - stuff much more full-time
36:07 - it can be much more of a primary driver
36:08 - an incentive okay snake game yes coding
36:11 - challenge number three the snake game
36:12 - most viewed video of mine at least of
36:15 - all time
36:16 - um all right so uh bezier curve
36:19 - i wanted to look at community
36:20 - contributions
36:21 - so let's see i honestly don't remember
36:23 - if i looked at any of these
36:24 - but um so i want to just look at all of
36:26 - these that are here and encourage you to
36:28 - submit your own
36:29 - um let's look at synth wave
36:32 - animation by chris sears who i know is
36:35 - at least was previously in the chat
36:37 - so let's take a look at this
36:39 - and see what happens loading loading
36:41 - loading loading
36:43 - whoa
36:47 - whoa i have i think i saw this but i
36:49 - definitely didn't look at this on stream
36:52 - because
36:53 - wow
37:00 - this is wild
37:03 - so um now i'm trying to even like
37:05 - understand how this is based off of my
37:08 - sketch i mean i guess i see it here this
37:10 - is my visualization of the
37:13 - quadratic bezier and with the sort of
37:16 - random motion but it's now mapped into a
37:18 - 3d space i feel like i'm like looking at
37:21 - a scene from tron or something
37:24 - this is amazing
37:25 - uh really cool stuff oh and there's
37:27 - music
37:29 - i don't hear it
37:31 - so
37:32 - um
37:34 - you know i'm i would love to it's
37:37 - probably like the way i have all my
37:38 - audio routing going on it's probably why
37:40 - the music is not being heard so
37:42 - apologies for that but it's probably
37:43 - better for me not to play the music on
37:45 - stream anyway uh but this is quite
37:48 - amazing this to me is the in uh it's
37:51 - just like the epitome of why i love
37:52 - doing this because i don't think when i
37:55 - was making my bezier curve example i
37:57 - ever would have thought of this visual
37:59 - application but i think there's so much
38:01 - um you know a bezier wander this on its
38:04 - own is wonderful but now this is leading
38:06 - me to think of so many different ideas
38:08 - yeah it's a great like uh
38:10 - yeah why t brent can ask is that the
38:11 - information super highway
38:14 - no but i could imagine this being like a
38:15 - nice visual for
38:17 - um you know some opening credits of of
38:20 - um some type of game or or other type of
38:23 - content yeah okay um thank you um turn
38:27 - click the canvas during the tangent
38:28 - lines ah
38:30 - oh fascinating so i i can't resist how
38:33 - much i love looking at this with the
38:35 - tangent lines and the colors
38:37 - but this also has a really nice
38:41 - uh quality to it
38:43 - now the move one thing that could be
38:45 - really interesting to experiment with it
38:47 - just occurred to me um it looks like
38:49 - this is probably based off of the random
38:52 - motion that's in my example where i'm
38:54 - just showing like okay see you can move
38:56 - the control points around the curve
38:57 - changes
38:58 - i don't know this to be true we could
39:00 - look at the code obviously but um i
39:02 - wonder if there were some type of um
39:06 - [Music]
39:07 - you know set of rules for the motion so
39:10 - that you know what if it were sine waves
39:12 - or purl and noise those are the obvious
39:13 - ones to start with but so that there's a
39:15 - connection as i'm moving through this
39:17 - space i'm seeing these rippling motions
39:19 - as each curve passes over me sort of
39:22 - passing its motion on to the next
39:25 - um so great great job um
39:28 - uh a bell and a
39:31 - train whistle for um this wonderful
39:33 - community contribution
39:35 - uh closing this one out and going on to
39:38 - bezier curve road editor i remember
39:41 - david telling me about this one so let's
39:43 - take a look
39:44 - [Music]
39:48 - what do i do here
39:50 - shift click to add points to the path
39:54 - so this is using the fact that you can
39:58 - uh chain
40:00 - the bezier curves together so if i go
40:01 - back to
40:03 - um i want a really quick way just to
40:04 - make a new page i guess right now the
40:06 - only way i know how to do this
40:08 - like there must be like in this can i
40:10 - have like multiple pages
40:13 - i can do cut and paste ah like can i
40:15 - make a like how do i make a new okay i'm
40:18 - gonna have to learn how to use this app
40:19 - later right now i'm just gonna do this
40:21 - um so one of the things that's really
40:23 - awesome about bezier curves i mentioned
40:25 - right we have two anchor points
40:28 - and two control points
40:32 - but um a bezier vertex just involves
40:37 - these three points here
40:39 - right that makes the entire bezier
40:41 - vertex like this is the next point we're
40:43 - going to but these control points and
40:46 - i'm sorry i really miss drew this
40:47 - because the curve doesn't pass through
40:49 - the control points that's a kind of
40:50 - common misconception or at least it's a
40:52 - misconception that i make so
40:54 - um oh wait what did i just do did i just
40:56 - change the color to white again
40:59 - what just happened
41:00 - right i don't know what's going on i
41:02 - obviously do not know how to use this
41:03 - piece of software
41:05 - i can have layers in procreate okay so
41:08 - um
41:10 - what's the bezier cat
41:13 - i don't was that the thing that i drew i
41:15 - have no idea what's going on anyway so
41:17 - these are doing a terrible job here
41:19 - these are the elements of the next
41:21 - vertex which means if i wanted to add
41:23 - another vertex i only need three more
41:25 - elements which would cause it to curve
41:26 - like this and then i could put
41:28 - three more elements and when i say
41:30 - element i mean three more points so the
41:32 - vertex the bezier vertex is a collection
41:35 - of three vertices the and i guess this
41:38 - little
41:39 - um it's it's where i am going to like if
41:43 - it were just oh wait what just happened
41:47 - um
41:50 - that was just an extra right
41:52 - it's where i'm going to like if i didn't
41:53 - have a bezier vertex i would just be
41:56 - going to the next vertex but because i
41:57 - do i'm kind of like curving around i
42:00 - have no idea what this would actually do
42:01 - with those two control points so super
42:03 - exciting
42:05 - so this looks like uh what
42:08 - david has done here and i believe the
42:10 - idea
42:11 - if i'm correct is
42:14 - ah yes look at this
42:16 - using bezier curves to create a drop
42:20 - like a road essentially and this would
42:22 - be a perfect
42:24 - complement to what i eventually someday
42:27 - will hopefully actually make i built a
42:29 - version of this during a live stream a
42:31 - while ago with an idea to make it as a
42:32 - multi-part
42:34 - set of video tutorials but i
42:36 - want to use ml5 the javascript machine
42:39 - learning library that i uh helped to
42:43 - maintain
42:45 - to train and ai in big quotes to drive
42:49 - along
42:50 - this path so
42:52 - dreams uh
42:54 - that's like a great project for the
42:55 - spring if i can get back to that
42:58 - wonderful work
42:59 - thank you for this
43:00 - david all right moving along
43:03 - uh everyone gets a bell
43:05 - and a train whistle now we're going to
43:07 - look at bezier curve lerp animations 2
43:09 - to 10 points by
43:11 - narayana
43:16 - okay gotta love this so one of the
43:19 - aspects of something that i emphasized
43:21 - in my video tutorial is how the bezier
43:25 - curve
43:27 - is
43:28 - the math behind the bezier curve is all
43:31 - about linear interpolation so linear
43:34 - interpolation between just two points is
43:36 - that line
43:38 - um and
43:40 - um but once i add that control point i'm
43:43 - then interpolating the interpolation
43:46 - between the anchor to control and the
43:47 - control to anchor so you can sort of see
43:49 - this playing out here in this animation
43:52 - so for example i think it'll be more
43:54 - obvious if i go to two points
43:56 - right there's i love how this
43:58 - demonstrates the idea so well this is
44:00 - linear interpolation from one point to
44:03 - another
44:04 - let's add one control point so now this
44:07 - is linear interpolation see how that's
44:10 - what that one point is interpolating
44:11 - between these two and the other one is
44:13 - interpolating between the other two and
44:14 - then between those two we've got this
44:16 - nice curve
44:17 - and is this the thing that i can move
44:19 - these points around no but it doesn't
44:20 - matter this is so wonderful i'm so
44:22 - excited about this
44:24 - now if i go to four this is what we're
44:26 - typically seeing as the cubic
44:28 - bezier but
44:30 - okay this is very exciting this really
44:35 - this merits a nice drum roll here let's
44:37 - go to five
44:39 - oh my god oh my goodness
44:42 - oh i'm getting
44:43 - getting a little warm over here oh
44:46 - that's wild
44:48 - oh that is so amazing
44:50 - um
44:52 - i i uh six
44:57 - this is so cool
45:00 - all right i i think i might be getting a
45:02 - delivery
45:03 - do you hear that beeping of the truck
45:04 - backing up
45:07 - uh
45:08 - okay and and and simon in the chat is
45:10 - telling like quartic
45:12 - um there's quintic there's all these
45:15 - different terms let's go let's just jump
45:16 - all the way to 10
45:18 - because
45:19 - i don't know how else to experience this
45:23 - amazing
45:25 - uh that is wild let's let's do 10 with
45:28 - random points
45:32 - um yeah i see a a delivery truck
45:34 - hopefully they're just gonna drop it off
45:35 - and don't need me
45:37 - um
45:41 - wow
45:43 - this is wild
45:44 - so i'm distracted by the delivery truck
45:48 - but not to mention this incredible uh
45:52 - variation off of
45:54 - the bezier video
46:00 - okay
46:03 - thank you for this it's incredible a
46:05 - huge round of applause can we do that
46:06 - also
46:10 - all right now moving along
46:13 - um i'm almost to 11 30 which is my
46:16 - halfway point so recently the rhythm of
46:18 - these live streams have been um me
46:21 - babbling for a bit showing some
46:23 - community contributions taking a break
46:25 - and coming back and coding something i
46:27 - have a couple ideas maybe i'll when i
46:29 - after i take a break i'll put a poll up
46:31 - um
46:33 - and yes i know there's a whole live poll
46:36 - system that was engineered by many
46:39 - wonderful generous contributors of
46:40 - coding training
46:42 - i can never seem to figure out how to
46:44 - use
46:45 - um which is totally my fault um and
46:48 - but now there's just this pull button in
46:50 - the youtube chat i can walk over here
46:51 - and set a poll
46:52 - all right i am going to go to curve art
46:55 - by larry campfire
46:58 - let's take a look at this one
47:00 - whoa okay i did not know
47:03 - that this was going to be me so wait i
47:05 - don't understand this
47:10 - is wild okay wait i have to understand
47:12 - how this is done
47:13 - so first of all what picture is that
47:19 - gloria
47:20 - [Music]
47:21 - i wish i need a dog cam
47:23 - so what picture is this i have no idea i
47:25 - mean obviously it's a picture of me but
47:26 - i don't remember it's like this is a
47:28 - picture that's released on the internet
47:30 - somewhere probably um
47:32 - so
47:33 - this looks like it is a uh what's
47:36 - happening here if i can understand this
47:38 - correctly
47:39 - and um
47:42 - i'm going to attempt to diagram my
47:44 - understanding of this
47:46 - so there is an image
47:50 - and it has an image as a grid of pixels
47:54 - so each pixel
47:56 - has some brightness value so imagine the
47:58 - image is gray scale and the brightness
48:00 - values are like
48:02 - five okay this is too thick i guess
48:04 - 110 i can do this right make it thinner
48:07 - you know 255
48:10 - 100
48:11 - 0 10 right you could imagine this
48:14 - grid of pixels
48:16 - um
48:18 - each with a grayscale value so i think
48:20 - maybe what's going on is then
48:23 - this is visualized
48:26 - right so normally you would take the
48:28 - grace if we're visualizing the data of
48:31 - an image i would take the grayscale
48:33 - value and i would
48:35 - render it as a block of pixels with that
48:38 - value
48:39 - at that spot
48:42 - that's what an image is it's really just
48:44 - a visualization of the data the color
48:46 - being tied to well typically like an rgb
48:48 - value perhaps with an alpha but in here
48:51 - just the grayscale example a single
48:52 - number a gray value but many other
48:55 - things
48:56 - can be
48:57 - mapped to
48:59 - color to represent the image and you
49:02 - know i think a very a well-known um
49:05 - example of this is even in the sort of
49:07 - like physical world is danny rosen's
49:09 - work
49:10 - you can see here these like amazing
49:12 - physical
49:13 - uh sculptures that take uh you know like
49:17 - little blocks of wood and rotate them to
49:20 - reflect light in different ways to
49:21 - create that pixel view
49:23 - um you know i'm trying to i love this
49:25 - one the like um
49:28 - it's these
49:29 - uh little penguins fuzzy penguins that
49:31 - like spin around so if they're facing
49:33 - you from their back they're dark uh
49:36 - facing you uh from the front they're
49:38 - bright so i really encourage you to
49:39 - check out danny rosen's work um if
49:41 - you're not familiar um look at all these
49:44 - videos that have obviously and links
49:45 - that have a tremendous amount more
49:47 - information so what's happening here i
49:49 - think is something similar of course
49:51 - it's still software and screen based so
49:52 - you can imagine doing this with like
49:54 - string or something but i think what's
49:57 - happening here is like if it is
49:59 - um
50:00 - a bright pixel
50:03 - maybe just a line is drawn
50:06 - and then if it's a darker pixel
50:09 - that line is if i zoom in
50:13 - it's bent
50:15 - so it like um
50:17 - would
50:19 - this is hard i don't really have my
50:21 - it would kind of like
50:24 - do this
50:25 - does it and that makes it like thicker
50:27 - or something so i i'd have to like try
50:29 - to figure this out but there's some kind
50:31 - of mapping
50:32 - of the grayscale pixel value to the
50:36 - uh curvature of the bezier curve itself
50:39 - i was thinking is the line getting
50:41 - thicker no it's just more pixels are
50:43 - being filled in because the curve has
50:45 - more
50:46 - uh the length of the curve there's more
50:48 - uh it's longer there's more space for it
50:51 - to fill and that by definition creates
50:54 - this sort of darker
50:56 - look to it so that's really wild i don't
50:58 - know that just would not have occurred
50:59 - to me
51:00 - to do that so what would be cool let's
51:02 - just see i'm just really curious
51:04 - um i want to take a version of this
51:09 - let me log in as coding train if you
51:11 - will indulge me for a second
51:15 - i don't know if this font is too small
51:18 - but
51:19 - and again i just want to emphasize this
51:22 - is um
51:23 - i am taking a larry campfire's example
51:26 - and i just want to see what it looks
51:28 - like with video so i'm going to say i'm
51:30 - going to add video
51:32 - let's comment out the image
51:34 - comment out preload
51:36 - and i'm going to say i know maybe it
51:38 - will take too long
51:41 - to run but let's let's we'll find out oh
51:43 - these are quadratic beziers so i was
51:45 - trying to in my attempt to think about
51:47 - it as a cubic bezier let's say uh create
51:50 - video actually let's just leave this as
51:52 - is with both the image just
51:55 - um
51:56 - create video
51:58 - uh create capture
52:00 - video so let's make sure this works
52:05 - so now i should have both this image and
52:08 - you can see there we are by the way so
52:09 - this is what it really looks like in
52:10 - here it's just a green curtain
52:13 - with a lot of lights and a much nicer
52:15 - camera than the webcam but that's what i
52:18 - look like standing here i
52:20 - one thing that i'm very unsure about so
52:22 - i need a haircut i don't always i don't
52:24 - need to wear a hat in every video but
52:25 - it's you can see this is a mess right
52:27 - now i'm a mess
52:29 - but uh lighting wise i'm just like i
52:31 - don't know if i have the right
52:32 - temperature lighting temperature
52:34 - settings on the camera anybody wants to
52:35 - help me with that i'm game but um okay
52:38 - so i should be able to
52:42 - figure out a way
52:44 - so this is using scale times image so
52:47 - let's do this
52:48 - i'm going to say
52:50 - uh
52:52 - video equals create capture and i want
52:54 - to take off the auto refresh and stop it
52:56 - so i'm going to make the
52:58 - video size i wanted to make it something
53:00 - that i know
53:02 - uh oh
53:03 - so it's actually multiplying up so let's
53:05 - make it like 40 let's take it 40 by 30.
53:09 - and let's just do the scale scale is
53:11 - eight i think that'll work is that going
53:14 - to be too slow i'm going to take out the
53:16 - no loop
53:20 - and so image should then
53:23 - where is it getting the pixel color
53:26 - it should be video ah so one thing will
53:29 - be this is an issue
53:31 - so it worked just fine because it was
53:33 - only doing it once
53:35 - but um
53:37 - using the get function to get the pixel
53:39 - color can be incredibly slow if you're
53:43 - doing it over every single pixel as
53:45 - opposed to just working with the pixel
53:47 - array directly but let's see what
53:49 - happens what's the worst thing that's
53:51 - going to happen let me try running this
53:53 - let me just comment out image so it'll
53:55 - throw an error if that's being used
53:56 - somewhere else
53:58 - and see what happens
54:00 - oh okay image is not defined right so i
54:02 - think what i'm going to do
54:04 - is just hard code in
54:06 - for right now
54:09 - what i know the size to be
54:13 - obviously i could pick it up from the
54:14 - video and then i got an error probably
54:16 - because the video isn't ready
54:20 - image is not defined no there's still
54:21 - another place where i'm using image
54:26 - ah okay
54:29 - this might throw an error because the
54:31 - video might not be ready
54:35 - oh nope totally working
54:39 - you can see it's totally working just
54:40 - running incredibly slow so is the
54:43 - slowness
54:44 - um just the bezier drawing the bezier
54:47 - curves themselves
54:49 - or
54:50 - i have to stop
54:51 - or can i get around that slowness
54:54 - by getting rid of that get function so
54:57 - the way to get rid of that get function
55:00 - i think gloria might have gotten tangled
55:04 - hold on everybody
55:06 - pause to help my poor
55:08 - no no she's not tangled she's not
55:10 - tangled okay she's on like a leash oops
55:13 - i'm okay um so what i can do instead is
55:16 - i should be able to say
55:18 - uh
55:19 - r equals video dot pixels
55:23 - the index plus zero so this is something
55:26 - i've covered
55:27 - uh like probably you know a thousand
55:30 - times
55:31 - um
55:33 - but i since i have this
55:38 - whiteboard thing here i'll do it again
55:40 - so let's just say these are my pixels
55:45 - they have row column numbers 0 1 2
55:48 - row numbers 0 1 2 but the actual pixel
55:52 - number is 0 1 2
55:55 - 3 4 5
55:57 - 6 7 8. so if i need to get the index 4
56:00 - for example i can actually just say what
56:02 - is its x value which is 1
56:05 - plus what is its row or y value which is
56:08 - also 1
56:10 - times the width which is 3. so in this
56:12 - case you can see that makes sense
56:14 - because 1 plus 3 is 4. 1 plus 3 is 4 4
56:17 - plus 3 is 7. so i'm going to add that
56:18 - formula
56:20 - into this code here
56:22 - saying index
56:23 - equals x plus y
56:26 - times
56:27 - times video dot with now here's the
56:30 - catch
56:31 - so while this is true
56:34 - this diagram that i've done is
56:35 - absolutely true
56:37 - there's actually four values in the
56:40 - array in each one of these spots and i
56:42 - did that wrong because there's r
56:45 - wait what
56:47 - why is it sometimes just change to white
56:49 - what am i doing am i like triggering an
56:51 - eraser i am i switch the eraser i see um
56:54 - there's an r a g a b and an alpha so red
56:58 - green blue and alpha
57:00 - so
57:02 - what i actually have to do is take that
57:04 - index
57:05 - which is which pixel am i on and
57:08 - multiply it by four because i've got to
57:10 - advance for every four spots can you
57:12 - hear gloria barking by the way does that
57:14 -  come in through the mic
57:16 - um
57:18 - i wonder if i can just
57:20 - i have not tried a stream ming i've
57:22 - worked in here but
57:24 - usually she'll she'll come or i'll go
57:26 - and check on her but
57:29 - um
57:31 - so this should give me
57:34 - the red green and blue values instead of
57:37 - using get by going directly into the
57:40 - array
57:41 - and then i could should just be able to
57:42 - replace them here with r this is a very
57:45 - fancy way i'm always so lazy and i just
57:48 - get the
57:49 - grayscale value by adding them up and
57:52 - dividing it by three the average of the
57:54 - rg and b but this looks like i guess
57:56 - this is probably using like luminosity
57:58 - or something it's using a larger
57:59 - percentage of the red value
58:02 - um
58:04 - wait what
58:05 - times r times yeah
58:07 - um 21 no no of the green value 21 of the
58:11 - red value 72 percent of the green value
58:13 - and seven percent of the b let's see if
58:14 - this uh improves anything
58:23 - i messed something up
58:27 - what did i do wrong
58:36 - i mean i thought i didn't have to do
58:38 - this do i need to call load pixels i
58:40 - think i do
58:41 - i think i have to call load pixels
58:44 - i know why i thought i didn't need to do
58:45 - that
58:46 - oh yeah look at that
58:51 - so see how much that improved the speed
58:54 - so now we're able to do this in real
58:56 - time oh i love this
58:58 - lovely look at this it's so
59:01 - cool now i think what i could do
59:03 - is make the scale let's see how
59:06 - could i do 80 by
59:09 - 60 or is that going to be much too slow
59:10 - let's give it a try
59:13 - um
59:18 - let's just do this to be a little bit
59:20 - more thoughtful about it
59:24 - um
59:28 - oh yeah okay
59:31 - let's just see if this works
59:33 - this might be too slow from a drawing
59:35 - standpoint yeah you can see now this is
59:36 - too slow from a drawing standpoint but
59:38 - it's actually kind of nicer with it and
59:41 - i think what i might like to do is even
59:42 - lower it and then just make the scale
59:46 - like 32
59:47 - let's try
59:48 - that's probably too extreme let's try
59:50 - 16.
59:55 - let's try 24.
60:00 - and i guess i guess 40 by 30 was a
60:03 - little bit nicer
60:05 - um
60:07 - where is there a stroke weight somewhere
60:09 - begin shape no fill
60:11 - stroke weight i'm just curious to like
60:12 - bump up the stroke weight a little bit
60:18 - and let's hit stop and let's try looking
60:21 - at this
60:23 - in
60:24 - full screen mode
60:26 - i know i'm taking quite a bit of time
60:28 - here
60:30 - huh
60:31 - what happened there
60:37 - cool kind of slow but still pretty wild
60:46 - all right
60:48 - thank you simon i'm like looking for my
60:49 - watch
60:50 - all right uh it is now uh officially the
60:53 - midpoint of today's a stream i do have a
60:57 - pretty much i really do need to stop by
60:58 - like 12 30.
61:00 - um
61:01 - i i hope that this is um that you are
61:04 - enjoying today so far let's uh thank you
61:07 - uh so much to ah
61:14 - um
61:15 - to uh larry campfire for that let's go
61:18 - to ah quartic bezier curve
61:21 - exciting by codefish and i apologize
61:23 - that i'm gonna end up you know kind of
61:25 - looking at some of these more quickly
61:27 - but this is core tick right because it
61:30 - has
61:30 - three control points
61:33 - great work working that out wonderful
61:35 - job code fish
61:38 - uh you responded perfectly to the prompt
61:40 - in my video and i am so happy
61:42 - uh let us go now to animated and control
61:46 - point bezier curve by alex hunter
61:51 - and
61:52 - what do i do here i click
61:54 - oh wild
61:57 - so i can just keep adding points
62:00 - and then i can speed it up whoa
62:03 - oh that is wild
62:05 - oh amazing so this is very much like
62:06 - what we saw before
62:08 - but now i have the ability to i um reset
62:12 - um
62:13 - to just actually just make my own points
62:16 - like if i go in a circle what happens
62:21 - and then uh also
62:23 - play around with the speed
62:25 - so have it run very very slowly or very
62:27 - very quickly
62:28 - amazing job
62:30 - this is all great
62:32 - a lot of breath from that uh now we are
62:34 - going to moving on an infinite loop made
62:37 - with bezier curves
62:40 - i might regret this but
62:42 - i'm kind of excited just by the title of
62:44 - that
62:53 - here we go
63:03 - oh there's a fly
63:06 - hmm
63:07 - error
63:12 - not sure what happened you know this
63:14 - full screen thing sometimes does mess
63:16 - things up
63:18 - i've noticed recently
63:19 - ah there we go
63:23 - awesome oh so it's like the infinity
63:26 - symbol
63:27 - somehow made with bezier curves and i
63:30 - love this little dot look how it's like
63:34 - i'm going to do sound effects for this
63:35 - [Music]
63:37 - somehow that speed which is going is
63:38 - this an illusion it's actually always
63:40 - moving at the same speed or no i believe
63:42 - it's slowing down it's probably
63:43 - following the actual interpolation
63:45 - wow
63:47 - so let's take a look here
63:50 - oh i see i see oh it's using the vehicle
63:54 - oh amazing somehow this is using
63:57 - something from nature of code oh no
64:00 - the vehicle yeah it's got like a vehicle
64:03 - in it somehow which is a great segue
64:06 - because the i don't know that anyone has
64:09 - made a community contribution for this
64:11 - yet because the video was just released
64:13 - yesterday but if you haven't watched my
64:15 - most recent
64:17 - video release on the coding train it is
64:20 - [Music]
64:22 - part of the nature of code series
64:25 - um all the way down here we have i'm you
64:28 - know i'm on this quest as i mentioned in
64:30 - the video to implement every single
64:34 - um
64:36 - craig reynolds steering behaviors i'm
64:38 - curious what people if people like these
64:39 - kind of goofy thumbnails that sort of
64:41 - like show little uh uh this triangle
64:44 - character kind of acting out but this
64:46 - particular wander behavior
64:48 - um we can see here yes look at this
64:53 - it seems like there haven't been made
64:56 - any variations based on this lesson see
64:58 - that's a very awkward sentence i
65:00 - probably wrote that sentence at one
65:02 - point but this is what i need i need to
65:04 - re really work on rewriting the language
65:06 - for the website and is the community
65:08 - contribution a community contribution or
65:10 - is it like a passenger's
65:12 - [Music]
65:14 - ticket no that doesn't make sense i
65:16 - don't know that's what i'm trying to
65:17 - figure out
65:18 - but yes there are no community
65:19 - contributions yet yet uh yet but you
65:22 - could be the first one you could submit
65:23 - it today i will be looking at them this
65:25 - afternoon on my own and i could come
65:26 - back and show them in a future live
65:27 - stream
65:29 - if you want help figuring out how to do
65:30 - that i would definitely join the discord
65:33 - which i just posted a link in the chat
65:35 - but let's take a look just at the
65:36 - various examples
65:38 - one of the things that i wanted to show
65:39 - you that i made for this video which
65:41 - wasn't part of the actual um
65:44 - coding itself and why is this so did i
65:47 - zoom in on this or something yes there
65:48 - we go um let me see can i drag this over
65:52 - i try to try to do this in 3d
65:55 - so one thing i was really pleased about
65:58 - is and so what is what is going on here
66:01 - um
66:02 - basically um the wander algorithm
66:06 - involves a vehicle
66:08 - and it needs to decide which way should
66:10 - it steer
66:11 - and the way that it decides is it
66:14 - projects a point out in front of it
66:16 - uh creates a circle at that point's
66:19 - location
66:21 - then projects a point out onto
66:23 - uh the edge of that circle and then
66:26 - steers in that direction then this point
66:28 - moves randomly over time
66:31 - and so what the result there is instead
66:34 - of just like making a lot of random
66:35 - motions sure that point might be moving
66:37 - randomly over time but it's not going to
66:40 - cause the vehicle itself to make a
66:42 - drastic change in direction until maybe
66:44 - it gets all the way back down like over
66:46 - here over here so it's a very effective
66:48 - way uh no no this is not where i'm
66:50 - swiping ah
66:51 - this is where i'm swiping
66:53 - so this is like i was trying to do this
66:55 - in 3d uh i think i might need everybody
66:58 - just prepare yourself
67:01 - i'm going to say something
67:03 - it's going to be a little bit scary i'm
67:04 - going to try to stay standing here not
67:06 - go anywhere i might need
67:08 - quaternions
67:10 - um to really figure out how to get my
67:12 - vehicle pointing in the right direction
67:14 - but um anyway i was curious if somebody
67:16 - has a better take on how to do this in
67:17 - 3d and visualize it i would love a
67:19 - contribution in that uh um
67:23 - vane
67:24 - i'm trying to think if there's anything
67:26 - else here i think this is kind of maybe
67:29 - a useful one to just for me to show you
67:31 - um you know think about how so this is
67:33 - the actual algorithm uh wander algorithm
67:35 - playing out
67:37 - and one of the things that i did with
67:38 - this is that i just attached some
67:40 - sliders so we could sort of see like how
67:42 - does it look if that circle cup becomes
67:43 - closer
67:44 - um or if that circle is much bigger
67:49 - um as well as i don't know what this one
67:51 - is oh the dismount of displacement is
67:53 - like bigger so this is a much more like
67:56 - actively changing direction wander
67:58 - versus if i were to put all these
68:00 - sliders down
68:02 - i would assume that with everything low
68:05 - um it's going to kind of move in the
68:07 - same and it's when i say move in the
68:08 - same direction it's not actually
68:11 - resolving to moving straight it's
68:13 - continuing to turn the same way for a
68:14 - while and then turn another way so
68:16 - there's a lot of
68:18 - possibilities for this i hope that you
68:20 - get a chance to explore this particular
68:22 - video tutorial and submit your community
68:26 - contributions so they could show up here
68:27 - i would love that so much
68:32 - how's everybody doing how is this stream
68:33 - so far um
68:35 - on a scale
68:40 - uh
68:42 - how is this
68:45 - is this stream on a scale of one to five
68:52 - oh i can only get four
68:54 - i guess so four is um
69:00 - four would be you really this is the
69:02 - best stream i've ever seen and one would
69:04 - be like
69:05 - you know
69:06 - [Music]
69:09 - i've liked previous streams that i've
69:10 - watched quite a bit more
69:12 - i don't know why i'm asking this it's a
69:14 - very
69:15 - dangerous thing that i've done like
69:17 - self-indulgent thing that i've done
69:20 - so but i would like a lot of feedback
69:21 - because i'm trying to figure out like
69:23 - what am i really doing here
69:26 - again my i think the way that i think of
69:28 - the
69:29 - universe of coding train content
69:32 - individual project videos coding
69:34 - challenges tracks i'm calling them
69:36 - tracks which are more like courses
69:38 - beginner beginner lessons um and you can
69:41 - see those if you're if you are a
69:43 - beginner um these are the ones where
69:45 - that you can start with on the website
69:48 - as well as some other tracks that are
69:50 - more themed around machine learning or
69:51 - physics simulation
69:53 - i am working hard to try to um
69:58 - record these and release them with
70:00 - good production value
70:02 - and then also live streaming once a week
70:05 - which is me just interacting with the
70:06 - community answering questions showing
70:08 - community contributions and what i'm
70:10 - doing today and then always programming
70:13 - something kind of new which is what i'm
70:15 - going to do in the second half even
70:16 - though i have no idea what i'm going to
70:17 - do yet
70:19 - so that's kind of i i would love to hear
70:21 - about like i'm trying to really be more
70:23 - sort of thoughtful and organized about
70:25 - how all the stuff is going i did not eat
70:27 - a very big breakfast this morning i'm
70:29 - starting to feel
70:31 - feel the um
70:34 - it's starting to punish me here a little
70:36 - bit as i cannot form words all right so
70:38 - um before i take a break it is time for
70:41 - me to mention to you um sponsor
70:44 - brilliant so
70:46 - um if you like learning
70:48 - and if you like learning from really
70:50 - well done
70:51 - exciting and interesting resources that
70:54 - you can find on the internet um
70:57 - like the coding train hopefully
70:59 - you are really going to like brilliant
71:01 - and i think brilliant the reason why i'm
71:03 - so pleased to have brilliant as a
71:04 - sponsor is it is a really wonderful
71:07 - compliment to what i do so here's what
71:09 - i'm doing talking at you
71:13 - attempting to draw diagrams blah blah
71:15 - blah blah blah trying to write some code
71:17 - here and there but if you would prefer
71:19 - to be a little bit more self-paced to
71:21 - have some quiet time on your own whether
71:23 - on your computer or through an app
71:25 - brilliant has both of those for lots of
71:27 - interactive lessons so a couple of the
71:29 - courses do they have daily challenges i
71:32 - should go to the brilliant website which
71:33 - i will do
71:34 - um
71:35 - they have daily challenges and they have
71:38 - a whole set of courses like if i just
71:40 - click on this page it's like everything
71:41 - that i love is all here
71:44 - geometry neural networks statistics
71:46 - logic computer science fundamentals
71:49 - and one of the things that i really love
71:51 - about it i'm going to go here to the um
71:54 - like the al the out one of the algorithm
71:56 - algorithm fundamentals course i believe
71:58 - this is um is that the lessons not only
72:01 - are oh let me read through this material
72:04 - and see what's there are actually
72:06 - allowing you to interact and so if you
72:08 - want to learn more about coding you can
72:10 - see like figuring out pseudo code and
72:12 - logic checking your answers stepping
72:14 - through these interactive lessons that's
72:16 - really a wonderful thing to do
72:18 - ah yes this is um this is the course
72:20 - that i'm really excited about here um
72:23 - and what you um like that so many of the
72:25 - courses involve these really fun visual
72:28 - dynamic puzzles um really to teach a
72:30 - particular concept like if you if you
72:33 - maybe you know the formula for the
72:34 - pythagorean theorem a squared plus b
72:36 - squared equals c squared but you don't
72:38 - really know it until you've gone through
72:40 - all these different lessons where you
72:42 - get to move shapes around i actually
72:43 - found it quite difficult
72:45 - um but it really helped me sort of think
72:47 - about fractals and infinity in a
72:49 - wonderful way let's go to the next
72:51 - problem
72:52 - um so which is still so this uh this
72:56 - this particular element of the course is
72:59 - talking about
73:00 - uh infinite areas and how to do sort of
73:03 - infinite tiling and then how do you
73:05 - consider the total area of what you've
73:07 - tiled um so i'm gonna just step through
73:09 - this so what oh i did this one already
73:11 - too i'm i'm further ahead i did this one
73:15 - oh yeah i remember doing these
73:16 - uh here we go oh no
73:20 - what fraction of the largest circle
73:23 - is shaded orange okay let me put up
73:26 - another poll
73:30 - um nobody's hating this stream so far ah
73:33 - a couple of you
73:35 - um i'm gonna put up another poll so um
73:38 - these are going to be how do i add a new
73:40 - poll
73:41 - uh
73:42 - can i kind of end this poll end poll
73:45 - okay now it should let me do a new poll
73:49 - come on youtube
73:51 - refresh the page
73:53 - okay
73:54 - uh i'm gonna do a poll
73:56 - yeah there we go so infinite areas it'll
74:00 - let everybody sort of think about this
74:02 - problem
74:03 - and i'm going to call them from top to
74:05 - bottom actually you know what i just put
74:06 - the answer in
74:08 - one half
74:10 - two thirds
74:12 - three quarters this is a fun thing to do
74:15 - and four fifths so i'm going to ask
74:17 - everybody in the chat
74:19 - and i'm going to start to think about it
74:21 - now
74:22 - as i
74:25 - uh go through this now i don't know
74:26 - where i see the result there we go now i
74:28 - see the results of the poll okay so all
74:30 - the circles in the pattern have the same
74:32 - center each radius is half the length of
74:35 - the previous circle
74:37 - i wonder if having a little thing that i
74:39 - can diagram will help
74:43 - um
74:44 - i really need to eat
74:47 - to be able to think this through
74:50 - right now three quarters is winning out
74:52 - it looks like
74:54 - so a lot of people voted for four-fifths
74:56 - though let's see who's right all the all
74:58 - circles in the pattern have the same
75:00 - center
75:01 - each radius is half the length
75:04 - so what basically if i come over here
75:09 - um
75:10 - what fraction of the largest circle
75:13 - is shaded orange so in other words
75:17 - uh oops
75:21 - right if this is
75:23 - a circle of radius r
75:26 - the area
75:28 - is pi r squared
75:30 - so then if i were to take that radius
75:33 - and divide it by 2
75:35 - half the area of this interior one
75:38 - is now
75:40 - pi r divided by two squared which is pi
75:43 - r squared divided by four
75:47 - so this area
75:50 - is three fourths
75:52 - right that area is three-fourths of the
75:56 - whole thing so it can't be three-fourths
75:59 - because we're going to get more stuff as
76:01 - we continue to go
76:04 - like we're adding up all the orange
76:09 - which fraction of the largest circle so
76:10 - it's got to be four-fifths
76:13 - i think it has to be four-fifths which
76:15 - interestingly enough now is gaining its
76:17 - momentum in the poll
76:19 - but like i uh you know if i look back at
76:22 - all the explanations
76:23 - there's a very precise way to
76:26 - provably know that it's four fifths but
76:27 - i'm just going to use my intuition
76:29 - to say four fifths
76:32 - and i got it right yes
76:36 - um wow this is like one of the most fun
76:38 - times we've ever had doing one of these
76:39 - um so and um we can see now that four
76:43 - fifths has in the poll taken over
76:45 - and is uh is now winning uh way up now
76:49 - um so that there's a nice little trick
76:51 - there like it does makes you do sort of
76:53 - see how you can get tricked in thinking
76:56 - that it would be three-fourths based on
76:57 - how i worked out that math but
76:58 - four-fifths is the answer and one of the
77:00 - things that i really like about
77:02 - brilliant as well is that if you go
77:05 - to um the explanations you will often
77:08 - you will see typically like a really
77:10 - excellent uh summary of how it is um
77:13 - that the you that have come to the
77:15 - correct answer
77:16 - so um i want to encourage everybody
77:18 - there's um to sign up for free you can
77:20 - sign up for free right now when i take a
77:22 - break it would uh
77:24 - um you know it helps out the coding
77:25 - train brilliant.org coding train um
77:28 - again if you want to unlock all of their
77:30 - premium content and courses um then you
77:33 - uh you would receive a uh the first 200
77:35 - people do so will receive a 20 discount
77:37 - off of that i will also note up here you
77:39 - can't see it i'm gonna remove the banner
77:41 - the last thing i would like to say to
77:42 - you is that it's a really wonderful gift
77:46 - so maybe you know somebody who loves
77:48 - math and puzzles and science and
77:49 - learning and you know you're not as
77:51 - interested in doing it yourself or you
77:52 - already have it um gifting premium is a
77:55 - wonderful thing you can do and it'll
77:56 - work to do that as well through
77:59 - whatever this url is brilliant.org
78:02 - coding train
78:03 - okay
78:04 - um oh
78:06 - did the stream crash
78:09 - i wonder how much was hopefully not too
78:11 - much was lost that's a you know perfect
78:13 - timing i mean uh that's me being
78:15 - sarcastic there if you weren't sure um
78:17 - so i'm gonna take a break um perfect
78:19 - thing to do is sign up during the break
78:21 - and i will be back in um hopefully less
78:23 - than five minutes because i don't have a
78:25 - tremendous amount of time left and what
78:27 - do you think i should code
78:30 - whatever if you have some ideas of
78:31 - something i should look at i mean i was
78:32 - kind of there's two ideas that i'm
78:33 - working with um there was a recent
78:37 - um was it
78:38 - oh there's there's a bunch of
78:40 - suggestions that came in through the
78:41 - discord i'm already forgetting what they
78:42 - are
78:43 - there was the um
78:46 - um number file video maybe and then
78:48 - there was something else
78:50 - and then i really do want to continue
78:52 - the steering behaviors because i need to
78:55 - figure them all out and then make videos
78:57 - about them so that actually is kind of
78:58 - probably what i should do
79:00 - um
79:01 - although ultimately this fall
79:04 - um i'm going to be focusing on machine
79:06 - learning and text programming because
79:08 - those are the topics of my courses okay
79:10 - taking my break sign up for brilliant
79:13 - and see you in just a few minutes
79:24 - [Music]
79:42 - so
79:47 - [Music]
80:06 - so
80:26 - do
80:40 - [Music]
80:45 - [Music]
80:50 - [Music]
81:01 - [Music]
81:27 - [Music]
81:48 - [Music]
81:54 - do
82:05 - [Music]
82:20 - do
82:23 - [Music]
82:25 - hi everybody the stream seems to be
82:27 - crashing
82:28 - so
82:29 - [Music]
82:33 - i think i'm back
82:35 - um
82:37 - so apologies for that
82:39 - hopefully
82:40 - it will
82:41 - continue to work um
82:43 - just another 30 seconds here
82:52 - [Music]
82:56 - do
83:01 - [Music]
83:11 - back
83:14 - definitely having some technical issues
83:16 - with the internet today
83:20 - um
83:24 - all right the radish pie
83:28 - um
83:34 - so the so the um
83:36 - there's been some good suggestions of
83:38 - things that answer today's coding train
83:40 - um
83:41 - it will be so
83:42 - idea number one is um i do want to look
83:45 - at i want to do all of these steering
83:47 - behaviors
83:48 - so if you love steering behaviors
83:50 - so containment is the next one on my on
83:52 - my list
83:53 - to figure out so what i would be doing
83:55 - during the live stream is kind of
83:56 - working through it to see if i can get
83:58 - the basic algorithm going and then i
84:01 - would later record a separate video all
84:03 - about it so that's option number one
84:06 - uh a really wonderful um suggestion that
84:08 - came in from david although i'm a oof
84:11 - reconnection successful i don't know you
84:13 - know i could
84:16 - just reboot the router
84:19 - which might be a thing that i need to do
84:22 - but given that i have so little time
84:23 - left so this would be a great one to do
84:26 - [Music]
84:27 - um but i
84:29 - um
84:30 - i look uh you know you could also
84:33 - support numberphile
84:34 - uh with brilliant but um and by the way
84:37 - if you're not already uh following
84:40 - um
84:41 - on twitter
84:43 - matt henderson
84:44 - you definitely should be because these
84:46 - visualizations are all just what i mean
84:49 - like in another life i would love to be
84:51 - able to make stuff as brilliant as this
84:53 - um
84:55 - whoa what is going on here
84:57 - anyway so um
84:59 - so doing my own version of this
85:02 - particular
85:04 - um
85:06 - um this particular visualization there's
85:08 - a really great one with chaotic bouncing
85:10 - balls as well that's an option of course
85:13 - i'm
85:14 - taking so much time talking about the
85:15 - options that i won't necessarily have
85:16 - time for any of them and then the the
85:18 - other one is uh the website
85:21 - 538
85:22 - a radish i don't know if
85:24 - i can find this
85:26 - very easily can you bake the radish pie
85:29 - up
85:32 - the boiler went on
85:33 - i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner
85:35 - than later makes a loud noise i don't
85:38 - know how
85:40 - how bothersome that is for you
85:42 - um would be to
85:44 - the next got louder um would be to look
85:47 - through this
85:48 - riddler problem can you bake the radish
85:51 - pie
85:52 - related to math logic and probability i
85:55 - assume i don't know if there's a good
85:56 - visual p5 element to this
85:59 - um
86:00 - so maybe this doesn't really fit so i'm
86:02 - kind of leaning towards just going
86:05 - the safe
86:06 - option which would be to work on
86:08 - containment
86:11 - and yqn is saying number file is my fav
86:14 - channel for coding inspiration which is
86:15 - absolutely true but why not uh
86:19 - 30 minute start of so steering
86:25 - containment
86:27 - the other option i said was
86:32 - venus rose
86:34 - if that's the right name for it and then
86:36 - the third option
86:38 - is this riddler and then do not follow
86:40 - what people actually voted on
86:42 - also
86:44 - it doesn't feel seem like the internet
86:45 - is working
86:46 - so this is all kind of a bit of a a bit
86:49 - of a mess
86:50 - i i'm like i've got a little bit of a
86:52 - headache i'm feeling a little late
86:53 - because i really did not eat anything
86:54 - this morning
86:56 - my wife likes to text me when i'm like
86:58 - busy teaching like remember to eat today
87:00 - because i really do just completely
87:03 - forget to go eat lunch
87:05 - and busy and then at some point later in
87:07 - the afternoon i'm like
87:09 - dying and this is sort of what's
87:10 - happening me now but i'm going to eat
87:12 - i have time to eat lunch at 12 30 before
87:14 - the rest of my afternoon meetings
87:18 - um but let's come back here
87:20 - and see
87:21 - uh steering looks like it is winning
87:23 - this right now which i'm pleased to see
87:25 - i might have put my thumb on the scale a
87:27 - little bit too much
87:28 - i'll give it another minute or two here
87:31 - um i'm looking at the various chats
87:35 - i mean containment would be the thing
87:37 - that would be best for me to like make
87:40 - forward progress on my life's work of
87:44 - redoing of implementing these steering
87:46 - behaviors so but i can see it's and it
87:50 - is um you know it's a little bit unfair
87:52 - because if you add up venus road and
87:54 - rose and riddler there's more votes than
87:57 - just containment although containment
87:59 - just got a huge burst all of a sudden so
88:02 - i'm gonna take this as uh gospel
88:04 - and let's go and start to actually work
88:07 - on the containment steering behavior so
88:10 - uh simon who is um
88:14 - oh and i need to go back to the oh i'm
88:15 - not in the live chat
88:18 - uh channel anymore
88:21 - um now i'm back
88:25 - look at the classic not the express that
88:28 - must have been related to the um
88:30 - radish pie
88:32 - i don't know
88:34 - but i think i'm going with containment
88:36 - based on the votes of the poll
88:38 - um
88:39 - and for have starting point for me i
88:41 - would love to hear it
88:43 - um
88:45 - how do you all feel i think what i'm
88:47 - gonna
88:48 - look
88:48 - i've got 25 minutes it's probably gonna
88:51 - take
88:52 - two or three minutes
88:54 - to reboot the router
88:57 - but the stream keeps crashing and the
88:59 - only thing i can think to do other than
89:00 - restart the computer
89:02 - would be to reboot the router
89:05 - restarting the computer feels much more
89:07 - um of an extreme thing because i've got
89:10 - everything set up the way that i've
89:13 - got things going i'm by the way i've
89:15 - purchased a new streaming computer
89:17 - because i do currently this one does not
89:19 - have
89:22 - the camera just went off are you serious
89:25 - yeah okay i'm gonna reboot the router
89:28 - camera's off i'll work on that so the
89:30 - stream is 100 going to go down
89:34 - but it will come back up
89:36 - say something hello
89:41 - i'm waiting to see a message from
89:43 - somebody confirming
89:46 - that you can hear and see me oh wow
89:48 - there's no everybody left
89:51 - wow
89:52 - rebooting the router is definitely did
89:55 - that end the stream
89:57 - hopefully not
90:00 - let me see if i can pull it up
90:09 - see me oh wow there's no everybody left
90:12 - oh no i'm back
90:14 - rebooting a router is def
90:17 - okay
90:19 - [Music]
90:24 - oh maybe people are coming back now
90:26 - people are coming back
90:28 - watch that number go up okay
90:31 - uh there we go
90:32 - all right maybe people are coming back
90:34 - maybe they actually didn't leave but
90:35 - everything got disconnected
90:37 - um all right so here i am back oh eric
90:40 - is in the chat i think i just saw eric
90:42 - why is this not showing up and i totally
90:46 - forgot
90:47 - um hi eric uh thank you for joining
90:50 - today um actually let me just if you'll
90:52 - indulge me for a second i want to just
90:54 - make a really quick plug
90:56 - of eric's gofundme
90:59 - if somebody could
91:01 - paste it into the chat one of the mods
91:04 - could paste the link i think you'll find
91:05 - it was recently on my twitter so eric is
91:08 - a dedicated viewer of the coding train i
91:10 - mean i don't wanna
91:11 - you're not so dedicated you don't have
91:13 - to be dedicated but i feel like you're
91:14 - dedicated you have corresponded with for
91:17 - uh many years
91:19 - i had a bicycle accident i think i met
91:21 - eric first when i had a bicycle accident
91:22 - and i broke my elbow and my wrist and i
91:26 - couldn't use either of my arms to type
91:28 - and i experimented with
91:31 - trying to use voice control i didn't get
91:33 - so far it was just a big learning curve
91:35 - and by the time i had learned how to do
91:37 - some things i was gaining use back and
91:39 - also just took a break
91:40 - so but um eric is disabled and works
91:43 - with his computer entirely through voice
91:45 - control
91:46 - that's really amazing and needs a new
91:48 - computer so i hope the coding train
91:49 - community could support um eric in
91:52 - helping him get um a new computer so i
91:54 - don't know if that got posted yet into
91:57 - the chat i haven't seen it i will pull
91:59 - it up myself
92:01 - i'm just going to go to twitter.com
92:03 - shiffman which is where you can find the
92:04 - link and there you go so uh find this
92:07 - gofundme link and if you're able to
92:08 - support please
92:10 - do okay now containment we're not going
92:13 - to get super far with this
92:15 - but i'm excited to at least get it
92:17 - started
92:18 - um it will lead me to the next videos
92:20 - that are coming out that have already
92:21 - been recorded are
92:23 - path following so if you're following
92:26 - along with my steering behavior
92:27 - obsession
92:30 - i have let's just look at these
92:32 - examples implemented of
92:35 - seek and flee pursuant of aid which i
92:37 - messed up
92:39 - so i think i need to record i'm going to
92:41 - make a little note here
92:42 - pursue and evade correction
92:45 - so that's a video i need to make
92:50 - if you're wondering i'm
92:52 - i'm look writing this stuff down here uh
92:55 - wander is done arrival is done obstacle
92:58 - avoidance is one
93:00 - um obstacles containment
93:03 - uh wall following
93:05 - [Music]
93:07 - so
93:08 - path following is done flow field
93:10 - following i have an example of but i
93:12 - don't know that i've ever explicitly
93:13 - made a video just about it other than
93:15 - some really old ones
93:16 - um so then a crowd path following leader
93:20 - following unlike so i'm not going to
93:21 - worry about these group ones but because
93:23 - i want to get through all of the simple
93:24 - behaviors first
93:26 - so it looks like i need to the videos
93:28 - that i need to make are on
93:30 - pursue and evade the correction
93:33 - obstacle avoidance containment and wall
93:36 - following and i believe
93:38 - that i have heard
93:40 - from my
93:41 - and by the way it hasn't crashed again
93:42 - right from my
93:44 - uh another dedicated viewer of the
93:46 - coding train simon
93:47 - that um
93:49 - that containment would be a good one for
93:51 - me to start with so let's go to it
93:54 - uh i um i didn't do any random numbers
93:57 - today and how come i lost the page the
93:59 - containment on it oh here it is
94:02 - so this is a little confusing to me
94:03 - because it is lumping it together in the
94:05 - paper
94:07 - with wall following
94:09 - but um
94:11 - i'm just creating a new page um
94:16 - but um i think i'm gonna be able to
94:18 - parse this okay variations on path
94:19 - following okay it's a variation on path
94:21 - falling that's good
94:24 - um obstacle avoidance is
94:28 - uh
94:29 - definitely the hardest of the three says
94:30 - simon
94:31 - wall following means to approach a wall
94:34 - or other surface or path what if by the
94:36 - way
94:38 - what if instead of making this full
94:40 - screen
94:42 - i kind of put this up in the corner here
94:45 - so if i start trying to diagram stuff
94:47 - while i'm reading this
94:49 - you'll be able to see both okay let's
94:51 - try this see how this goes
94:53 - wall following means to approach a wall
94:55 - or other surface or path than to
94:57 - maintain a certain offset from it okay
95:02 - containment refers to the motion which
95:03 - is restricted to remain within a certain
95:06 - region
95:07 - okay so
95:09 - just thinking about this
95:12 - let's start with like the simplest
95:13 - possible case
95:16 - i have a 2d canvas
95:19 - i have a vehicle and its job is to never
95:22 - is to stay within the canvas so that's
95:24 - containment
95:26 - okay and i've made my own version of
95:28 - this in a weird sort of way i think in
95:30 - the nature of code book i talk about
95:32 - having a steering behavior or a force
95:34 - that just emanates from the edges but
95:35 - that's probably my implementation is
95:37 - probably overly simplistic or different
95:39 - than here
95:40 - fish swimming in aquarium hockey players
95:42 - skating within an ice rink to implement
95:44 - first predict a character's future
95:46 - location great so that's something i can
95:48 - always do right look at the current
95:50 - velocity
95:52 - and predict its future location
95:55 - okay this is actually working quite well
95:57 - having the diagram like this i kind of
95:59 - like this
96:02 - if it is inside the allowed region no
96:04 - corrective steering is necessary
96:06 - otherwise we steer toward the allowed
96:08 - region this can be accomplished by using
96:10 - seek with an inside point
96:13 - oh
96:14 - wow this is starting to sound easier
96:16 - than i thought it might be
96:18 - so
96:19 - um so let's let's i don't even need to
96:21 - read any further obviously there's more
96:22 - to do but let's create a basic example
96:26 - so i think what i want to do and
96:28 - unfortunately the problem with my little
96:30 - method here is i have very little screen
96:32 - space
96:35 - for coding but let's
96:37 - open up
96:38 - um
96:40 - steering
96:45 - and these are my corrections let's look
96:47 - at
96:53 - i'm trying to remember this is pursue
96:55 - wander um
96:57 - let's look at i think this um
96:59 - let's look at
97:06 - i'm trying to remember where i first do
97:07 - a future location well wander does that
97:09 - let's just go to wander i'm so silly
97:12 - um
97:16 - so i'm gonna go to wander
97:18 - the very basic
97:20 - wonder okay so i'm gonna duplicate it
97:25 - and i'm gonna call this containment
97:29 - okay
97:30 - i'm gonna give myself
97:31 - much more space for the code
97:34 - i'm going to move this back over here
97:37 - and so the diagram stuff is going to be
97:39 - pretty small
97:41 - let's go to the sketch
97:44 - let's make this just like
97:46 - 300 by 200.
97:50 - there we go okay and i one thing i want
97:52 - to do right now as interesting as it is
97:55 - is let me take out this history thing
98:01 - because
98:01 - [Music]
98:03 - it is not
98:07 - as
98:10 - relevant here
98:13 - okay
98:16 - and whoops
98:21 - so now let's also take out this so i'm
98:23 - just trying to simplify wander for a
98:25 - moment
98:26 - and i need to write a new function
98:28 - called containment
98:30 - so it probably would make sense
98:32 - for this function
98:34 - to be something like
98:37 - um
98:37 - [Music]
98:38 - you know to receive like a region that
98:40 - you're being contained in but i'm going
98:42 - to make a again a lot of over simplistic
98:46 - i'm going to simplify this possible
98:48 - scenario space
98:50 - by just considering that the actual
98:52 - canvas is the region
98:54 - so the first thing that i need to do
98:56 - is get a prediction
99:00 - which i can do by and i'm kind of doing
99:02 - what i've done in other so this would
99:04 - make sense like predicting the future
99:05 - location probably would make sense to
99:07 - break that out into a separate function
99:09 - entirely because it's a repetitive task
99:11 - that's happening in multiple steering
99:12 - behaviors but for the sake of argument
99:14 - right now i'm going to keep it right
99:16 - here
99:17 - i'm going to say
99:20 - let's look at
99:24 - um
99:26 - it's future location like uh let's say
99:29 - like
99:29 - a 30 frames from now
99:32 - and
99:33 - let's add that
99:35 - to this position the position and uh
99:38 - draw a red dot
99:42 - and sometimes i like just using stroke
99:46 - which is sort of silly but uh and then
99:48 - say uh point
99:50 - at this step uh prediction
99:53 - x and this prediction y
99:57 - okay
99:58 - so all i'm doing so far is that i've got
100:01 - the vehicle
100:02 - i look at its velocity i make a longer
100:05 - version of the velocity and then i add
100:09 - that to the position right that's the
100:10 - position and i get this future location
100:13 - and i draw it red so hopefully if i run
100:16 - this
100:18 - cannot read property of undefined where
100:20 - is this push happening
100:26 - ah
100:27 - okay let's take this out
100:30 - and
100:32 - also instead of wander
100:35 - let's call containment
100:42 - uh cannot read property undefined of x
100:45 - where
100:49 - tell me where
100:51 - vehicle js line 35
101:00 - i spelled it wrong good job
101:02 - no
101:04 - prediction equals this.velocity.copy
101:07 - add this position
101:10 - oh it's i put this prediction ah
101:17 - this is taking me much too long to find
101:18 - this clip
101:23 - oh i can't even find it there we go
101:29 - um okay let's see what we got now
101:31 - there we go
101:32 - okay great
101:34 - so we see
101:35 - i'm predicting the future location
101:38 - and let's predict it 100 frames ahead
101:42 - which is just and now basically what's
101:45 - the next step in containment
101:53 - if it is inside the allowed region no
101:56 - corrective steering is necessary so i
101:58 - need to know is it inside the um i still
102:02 - keep looking at my watch 10 minutes left
102:04 - and i'm really really
102:06 - struggling for energy and brain power
102:08 - here
102:09 - any suggestions for what i have lent for
102:11 - lunch today a nice salad
102:12 - with some beans maybe
102:18 - so this is going to be to be continued
102:20 - but
102:22 - so
102:22 - one thing that i probably would want to
102:24 - build for myself
102:26 - is generic functions to determine if
102:30 - um some particular
102:32 - spot is inside uh some particular region
102:36 - and i believe that i've maybe done this
102:38 - with looking at like is a point inside a
102:41 - polygon maybe i only did it in
102:44 - convex or concave or whatever thank you
102:47 - marvel man
102:50 - but um
102:55 - i think so let's let's let's do this in
102:57 - a sort of
102:58 - let's build the tools to be sort of more
103:00 - generic
103:02 - but
103:03 - um keep it sort of simple
103:05 - so i'm gonna write a function
103:09 - just called
103:10 - contains
103:12 - and
103:13 - a vector
103:16 - so i need like a region
103:18 - so i i want a generic function and oh
103:21 - the camera went off again
103:23 - i think it's overheating
103:26 - this is what's going on because it's
103:28 - fully charged
103:30 - wow so
103:33 - uh
103:35 - youtube mem youtube members or anyone
103:40 - when i announce
103:43 - on friday morning that i'm going to be
103:44 - live streaming like a couple hours from
103:46 - now your response should be did you eat
103:48 - breakfast
103:54 - uh simon's telling me that the diagram
103:55 - really explains this well
103:57 - which i can see that it does ah yeah so
103:59 - like we can see this like look at this
104:01 - ah this is great thank you simon so we
104:03 - can sort of see what's going on here
104:04 - right i've got this one if the point is
104:06 - outside the region
104:07 - somehow project a point back in and
104:09 - that's the steering target do nothing
104:11 - here do nothing here here this is
104:13 - outside projected so i don't know
104:14 - exactly how to project this point looks
104:16 - like it's doing it as like a normal
104:18 - somehow to the sort of path of the wall
104:21 - um yeah i need to get a
104:24 - referral bro is telling me to get a fan
104:26 - on it that's definitely what i need to
104:28 - do
104:29 - it's quite warm i mean it won't be an
104:30 - issue once it's cooler weather
104:33 - um but i'm like there's no air
104:34 - conditioning in here and i'm in a garage
104:37 - it's kind of like half an outdoor space
104:38 - which i'm a little bit worried about
104:39 - having all this equipment in they may
104:41 - have suggestions for how to
104:43 - appropriately keep like do i need like
104:46 - dehumidifiers is that the thing that i
104:48 - should be getting for this um garage
104:50 - space
104:51 - um i know i'm
104:57 - uh okay so
104:59 - um
105:00 - let's uh let's write this function
105:03 - um but i'm going to
105:06 - comment this out and just say it is now
105:10 - contains
105:11 - so eventually i want to figure out how
105:13 - to define the region
105:15 - and
105:17 - figure out if the vector is within that
105:19 - region but i'm going to treat this in a
105:21 - very simple way by just saying as long
105:23 - as v dot x is less than width
105:28 - and i should actually just do return
105:30 - so i'm going to return
105:32 - v dot x is less than with
105:35 - and
105:36 - v dot x is greater than zero
105:40 - and
105:41 - v dot y
105:43 - is
105:45 - uh less than height
105:47 - and
105:48 - v dot y is greater than zero and i'm
105:50 - going to change this to
105:52 - i should probably do this no no that's
105:54 - fine this works
105:56 - because it's just the point
105:58 - okay
105:59 - so
106:00 - uh let's take a look oh it wow it
106:03 - when i auto formatted it put it all in
106:05 - one line
106:06 - um so now i should be able to say
106:09 - um
106:10 - here
106:12 - if
106:13 - contains prediction
106:18 - and let's do
106:19 - um
106:22 - i was going to change the color of the
106:23 - dot but as soon as the dot is out
108:27 - okay my audio should be back
108:29 - unfortunately now i'm using this mic
108:31 - which is maybe a good mic for podcasting
108:34 - if i'm talking really close up to it in
108:36 - a very very
108:37 - deep voiced kind of way
108:39 - but i know it's going to be really
108:40 - echo-y and the audio won't be as good
108:42 - but
108:44 - as i have approximately two minutes left
108:48 - so much technical fail today
108:50 - um so and and i'm i'm kind of losing
108:53 - steam so i'm not i didn't
108:56 - this wasn't my best uh
108:57 - stream but pretty good for not having
109:00 - stream for a while from being in a brand
109:02 - new location with new equipment uh
109:04 - obviously it would have made sense if i
109:06 - could have done several practice streams
109:08 - before i came and did today but
109:11 - welcome to today's practice stream
109:13 - sponsored by
109:15 - brilliant
109:17 - i'm gonna wrap things up
109:19 - uh the audio is better
109:24 - this is better audio that seems crazy to
109:26 - me but maybe it is um
109:29 - uh it it will suffer from me like
109:32 - walking over here
109:33 - because now i'm like moved away from it
109:35 - or if i turn and talk in this direction
109:37 - versus turn and tonic in this direction
109:38 - but
109:39 - um
109:41 - um anyway so i think i've got to wrap
109:42 - this up i have to just uh i was gonna
109:44 - say quit while i'm ahead but i'm way
109:46 - behind so quit before i fall further
109:49 - behind i'm gonna read an explanation
109:52 - um it's a reflection like do you see the
109:54 - blue segment is the left yeah so so the
109:57 - next step here that i would need to do
109:59 - um and i think i can make this bigger
110:03 - is that basically
110:05 - if um if what i see is that the future
110:08 - location is here
110:11 - what i want to do
110:12 - is create a
110:15 - reflection
110:17 - i'm just looking at this
110:20 - which would go i guess like this
110:23 - oh sorry you can't see that
110:25 - which would reflect back so whatever
110:27 - this distance is
110:29 - this is a distance d ah i look for the
110:32 - distance so i'm going to be doing some
110:33 - kind of normal point finding just like i
110:35 - did in path following great so the tools
110:37 - of pathfinding will apply so i did i
110:39 - forgot i did this in path following
110:42 - uh the last mic was better okay i'm
110:43 - hearing
110:45 - hi stig
110:47 - um you're having dinner i haven't even
110:49 - had uh i had like literally like i had
110:51 - like of some blueberries this morning
110:53 - it's all i had as i was getting my kids
110:55 - ready for school
110:57 - so like kids at school i don't have to
110:59 - worry about they're like waiting for me
111:01 - to do something but apparently i forgot
111:02 - to feed myself um
111:04 - i had coffee uh
111:07 - not enough not enough sustenance to
111:09 - stream for two hours so i'm gonna do so
111:12 - this is in the path following videos
111:13 - which will be coming out as soon as i
111:16 - can get to reviewing and making the
111:17 - additional content for them do exactly
111:19 - this
111:20 - they take a given point project it onto
111:23 - some
111:24 - line segment
111:26 - this is scalar projection is what i'm
111:28 - doing or vector projection
111:30 - then whatever that distance is continue
111:33 - that normal
111:35 - out
111:36 - that same distance and then this is the
111:39 - target to which i will seek
111:41 - so i now understand
111:45 - uh i now
111:46 - understand that what i need to do so at
111:50 - a minimum this live stream was very
111:51 - useful for me i don't know uh it's
111:53 - harder for you maybe if you're new to
111:55 - things here to process this because i
111:57 - haven't released the path following
111:59 - examples yet but simon's been saying
112:01 - this to me probably for like six months
112:03 - and i can see now that he's absolutely
112:04 - right
112:05 - this containment will follow very well
112:09 - from
112:10 - um
112:12 - will follow really nicely from the path
112:14 - following content so i'll be able to so
112:16 - i will be back so i'm really um
112:19 - with the exception of what i will be
112:21 - october 22nd for sure
112:23 - um
112:25 - i will be live streaming every friday at
112:28 - this time i'm one thing i'm really
112:30 - hoping to do is establish a regular
112:31 - schedule i might like to do a poll
112:34 - in um i might like to do a poll in the
112:36 - discord about what like time on friday
112:39 - is best for everybody because i do have
112:41 - the flexibility to stream like earlier
112:43 - in the morning or a little later in the
112:45 - afternoon that i'm eastern time new york
112:47 - i'm you know on the east coast of the
112:49 - united states um so that i don't know if
112:51 - the mods want to help me remember this i
112:53 - do want to put out these polls about the
112:55 - new website stuff so that's first so
112:57 - join the discord there's another plug
112:59 - please join the discord um if you want
113:02 - to help engage with some of the surveys
113:04 - that we'll be putting out
113:06 - but i'm kind of curious to think about
113:07 - what time on friday might be best for
113:10 - the kind of global international
113:11 - audience
113:12 - um that there is
113:14 - um
113:15 - all right um
113:19 - yeah so will william asks what reference
113:21 - material are you using so in case this
113:23 - is um
113:24 - new to you
113:25 - here's where you want to look um so
113:27 - first of all all of this is coming from
113:29 - this paper 1991 paper steering behaviors
113:31 - for autonomous characters it's something
113:33 - that i'm working on working through i
113:35 - mean i've been working through this
113:36 - stuff since
113:37 - 2008
113:38 - or probably even before that um a big
113:41 - source of inspiration for this also is
113:44 - um casey reese's work uh artworks and
113:46 - look at his process compendium which is
113:49 - a nice
113:50 - um
113:53 - um
113:54 - um this this particular set of videos
113:57 - about casey reese's work is highly
113:59 - relevant in braitenberg vehicles but um
114:02 - if you go to codingtrain youtube channel
114:06 - it should be here under nature of code
114:08 - two
114:09 - if i start to scroll through these
114:12 - once i get to oh well let me just go to
114:14 - here
114:16 - once i get to
114:18 - chapter
114:20 - five
114:23 - uh chapter five are all of is what i'm
114:25 - working on now the camera went off again
114:28 - this is so sad i'm just gonna i'm not
114:30 - even gonna try i'm gonna let it cool
114:31 - down for a minute so sorry
114:34 - um
114:36 - so
114:37 - um
114:40 - the the this the five point x series is
114:43 - me attempting to make a video about
114:45 - every one of these steering behaviors um
114:47 - and so uh you know if steering behaviors
114:49 - is new to you
114:50 - start with 5.1
114:53 - but if a lot of this stuff about coding
114:55 - with vectors and motion is new to you
114:57 - then honestly i would start with
114:59 - 1.1 or even some of these other intro
115:02 - videos they don't necessarily um
115:05 - um it's not his exact sequence but 1.1
115:08 - is where i would start um yeah so
115:11 - sorry for all the technical difficulties
115:13 - here the camera's shutting off the
115:14 - internet going in and out seems like
115:16 - rebooting the router really did fix that
115:18 - so maybe that's something i should just
115:19 - do every time before i stream
115:21 - uh the mic i have rechargeable batteries
115:24 - that i recharged for the lav mic all the
115:26 - way up to a hundred percent and i'm
115:28 - walking away from the mic down to turn
115:30 - the camera back on at least just say
115:31 - goodbye
115:33 - but
115:36 - i think i need new ones or something
115:38 - obviously didn't work
115:40 - so if you have
115:42 - thoughts or suggestions on
115:45 - ways that i can improve i'm really
115:46 - working on the setup here i'm curious
115:48 - what people thought of having this like
115:50 - ipad for diagrams versus
115:53 - um
115:54 - you know i'm just gonna um
115:56 - let's just do this really quick
115:58 - uh can i do this new uh well let me do
116:01 - it so i'm closing this out
116:02 - i'm gonna do this new movie recording
116:04 - because this is gonna be my rope
116:07 - oh no no no come on
116:08 - new movie recording oh yeah yeah i
116:10 - didn't have to close it i could just
116:11 - switched it
116:12 - to oh i bet you if i just plug in my oh
116:16 - wait a sec hold on
116:19 - can i just turn on the camera
116:21 - uh
116:23 - yeah ah there we go look at this okay so
116:26 - this is my setup a little bit you can
116:27 - see the outdoors there um this is like
116:30 - where i have a whiteboard
116:32 - and i would put another camera over
116:33 - there this is my new light
116:35 - oh you don't see any of this
116:37 - i'm not even showing you the screen
116:39 - that's so sad
116:41 - oh that was pathetic okay so uh here
116:44 - here i am
116:45 - um
116:46 - uh like here's me
116:49 - hi
116:50 - uh with my green screen uh and this is
116:52 - the space that's that mic and you can
116:54 - see uh gloria
116:56 - maybe gloria's maybe maybe uh my wife
116:59 - took gloria inside or she's sleeping
117:01 - somewhere in the grass where i can't see
117:02 - her um over here
117:04 - i should just reverse the camera
117:06 - i've never used like
117:08 - this uh over here you can see i have a
117:10 - white board
117:12 - and uh another tripod there which i was
117:14 - trying to put another camera on but i
117:15 - just need another kind of even put a
117:16 - little light over there but this is i
117:18 - knew this light is really awesome
117:20 - um
117:21 - i have two of these so i got a and i
117:23 - have this one i have some sound blankets
117:25 - and this is the camera there so you can
117:26 - see the setup that i'm kind of um
117:28 - working with now um this is a little
117:31 - like
117:32 - uh streaming pc i'm gonna give this to
117:34 - my son to be for his school and homework
117:36 - computer and get a new streaming
117:38 - computer
117:39 - um that can handle more inputs with a
117:41 - with a real capture card
117:43 - um
117:44 - so this hopefully gives you a little uh
117:46 - quick
117:47 - um behind the scenes and since my
117:49 - camera's not working um now you can see
117:52 - so
117:53 - uh and and david asked how many new
117:55 - studios have you had since december of
117:57 - 2019 so it's not my textbook i had
118:02 - i had uh do not disturb on so that my
118:06 - text messages wouldn't come through and
118:08 - one just came through
118:09 - so
118:10 - um
118:11 - anyway uh
118:13 - i'm wrapping up um it is so i started
118:17 - just recording videos in my little tiny
118:20 - office at nyu
118:21 - in the tisch building then i moved to a
118:24 - closet in the tisch building then i
118:26 - moved to brooklyn so i had a different
118:28 - closet in brooklyn which still exists
118:31 - that still exists i just haven't had
118:32 - time to go in there so i do have two
118:34 - studios right now but this is my
118:36 - my own space with my own equipment that
118:38 - i am putting all you know the
118:40 - sponsorship and the member stuff oh
118:42 - right now everything goes towards like
118:45 - building out this new studio and uh and
118:48 - also like the coding train team that's
118:49 - helping me with various things like
118:50 - video editing and social media and stuff
118:52 - like that so um thank you to brilliant
118:55 - and thank you to all of you who watch
118:56 - and support um i'm really hoping that
118:58 - this can become my own space that i can
119:00 - really have ownership over
119:03 - and kind of
119:04 - see where that leads
119:05 - so
119:06 - uh
119:08 - malu asks how old i am i am 48 years old
119:13 - uh my dream by the way
119:15 - i'd probably do this my 50th birthday i
119:17 - want to go on a like train ride maybe in
119:20 - like a scotland or like through alaska i
119:25 - don't know there's i went on this
119:26 - amazing train in norway once i want to
119:27 - go on a like trip
119:30 - so tell me all of your best like you
119:32 - know look i don't i don't that didn't be
119:34 - luxury but i just mean like an overnight
119:36 - where the train ride itself is the
119:37 - experience
119:38 - um i think they have some yeah i i think
119:41 - i saw one that looked interesting in
119:42 - scotland but maybe there's so let me
119:44 - know
119:45 - thank you william uh
119:49 - and so i um i want this to be the setup
119:51 - though where i can both record videos so
119:54 - i do extra streams for members which are
119:56 - my recording sessions but i don't have
119:57 - all the equipment yet to do that
119:59 - and i got to stop i got to say goodbye i
120:01 - love you all
120:02 - every single one of you watching right
120:04 - now i really appreciate you
120:06 - and um
120:08 - trans-siberian india says i should have
120:10 - never been to india it's a little
120:12 - traveling is a little complicated right
120:14 - now
120:15 - uh with the global pandemic i hope
120:17 - everybody's doing okay but um i hope to
120:19 - get back to it
120:21 - i'm exhausted i'm gonna go eat lunch i'm
120:23 - gonna say goodbye uh you're gonna hear
120:24 - this dot song and see the outro thing
120:27 - again if you wanna support me
120:29 - um
120:30 - uh uh um watch
120:33 - send me a nice um comment somewhere on
120:36 - youtube like a video is a thing people
120:38 - can do uh join sign up for brilliant
120:41 - that's probably the primary way right
120:42 - now that you should support uh and
120:45 - there's also the membership and all
120:46 - sorts of other things like that um i
120:48 - gotta stop talking i gotta find the this
120:50 - dot song i'm sorry i didn't read any
120:52 - random numbers by the way
120:54 - if you are a member in the chat and you
120:56 - received your whistle
120:58 - post about uh if you like it it's like
121:01 - laser etched oh hold on i can do this
121:03 - now i'm going to show you this whistle i
121:05 - swear
121:06 - i'm i swear i'm stopping
121:09 - hopefully no more embarrassing text
121:10 - messages will come in
121:12 - uh one more
121:14 - uh where's the movie recording
121:17 - i minimized it i want to show this to
121:19 - you all
121:21 - uh i need so
121:23 - um okay take a look at this
121:26 - this is your you can have this this is
121:28 - your very my very own
121:30 - laser etched coding train train whistle
121:35 - and it has on this side
121:40 - a um
121:42 - i don't know why i can't okay there we
121:43 - go where's the camera on this thing it
121:45 - has on this side i should get out a
121:47 - portrait
121:51 - it has and i'm sorry that this is
121:53 - inverted this is a random walk pattern
121:56 - that is using the random numbers from
121:58 - the random number book that i use this
122:00 - is the number and this is the position
122:01 - in the book that started this pattern um
122:03 - i'm giving these as gifts for uh members
122:06 - youtube members of the coding train
122:07 - starting with the conductor and above
122:09 - level but maybe eventually everybody
122:11 - will get them uh thank you for watching
122:13 - i will see you
122:14 - next time next friday same time right
122:17 - probably the same time next friday i
122:19 - will have eaten breakfast

122:22 - uh
122:23 - uh
122:24 - yeah that's it that's all i got goodbye
122:27 - i don't have the music page open i'm

123:21 - this dot
123:22 - [Music]
123:36 - this dot song never forget the this dot
123:39 - somebody composed that song for me
123:53 - i'm gonna say once again here we go
123:56 - sing it with me it's the forward
124:01 - coordinate song
124:03 - [Music]
124:06 - it's the forward to cartesian
124:09 - coordination
124:25 - autotune and the internet will fix that
124:27 - for me
124:32 - sing it with me it's the
124:35 - new cartesian
124:36 - coordinate
124:40 - [Music]
124:47 - [Music]
124:57 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
125:00 - else is there
125:03 - yes kittens thank you very much kittens
125:05 - and rainbows and cupcakes notice that
125:08 - look what i get
125:09 - i'm really losing my mind
125:11 - okay let's do it
125:14 - [Music]
125:28 - the kittens the kittens
125:30 - kids kittens and kittens
125:35 - [Music]
125:39 - the kittens the kittens kittens and
125:41 - kittens and kittens the kittens
125:46 - [Music]
125:51 - the
125:55 - kittens kittens
125:57 - [Music]
126:16 - [Music]
126:27 - i feel just sort of like a nice
126:30 - feeling of relaxation
126:32 - everything's gonna be okay today
126:34 - dream is not broken it has not frozen
126:36 - this is a this is a wonderful thing
126:39 - okay we're gonna do it i'm really
126:41 - getting to something i need my sound
126:42 - effect
126:46 - [Music]
126:56 - what else is there unicorns and rainbows
127:01 - and cupcakes
127:03 - that was invalid syntax i forgot uh
127:05 - there was one other thing here that i
127:07 - think is important that i will use
127:10 - continuously over and over again
127:12 - all sorts of text generation analysis
127:15 - things
127:16 - that i will use continuously over and
127:18 - over again
127:20 - first thing i need to do is yes
127:27 - [Music]
127:49 - goodbye everybody i've already turned
127:51 - the camera off so i can't come back to
127:52 - say goodbye but i'm
127:54 - ending the stream now
127:57 - i could just find where that button is
127:59 - to
