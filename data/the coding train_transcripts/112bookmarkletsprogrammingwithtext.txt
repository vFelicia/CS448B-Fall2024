00:00 - hello this video tutorial where I'm
00:03 - going to show you how to make a very
00:04 - simple basic bookmarklet and this is
00:07 - really a warm-up my goal here in the
00:09 - next video and the video after that and
00:11 - the video after that is to start looking
00:13 - at Chrome extensions Chrome extensions
00:15 - are a much more powerful way to affect
00:18 - the browsing experience as a whole and
00:20 - actually the interface elements and all
00:23 - sorts of stuff
00:24 - in the Chrome browser but a bookmarklet
00:26 - is a really quick and easy way to add a
00:28 - button that's like a bookmark that
00:30 - triggers some code that changes your
00:32 - browsing experience so let's look at how
00:33 - that works
00:34 - so before I get to that I'm gonna leave
00:38 - it es5 which is and not use some of the
00:42 - fancier newer JavaScript syntax just to
00:44 - sort of demonstrate the simplicity of
00:46 - the idea but I I'm sure that it will get
00:48 - people watching who will help suggest
00:50 - fancier ways to write the same code and
00:52 - I look forward to including that in the
00:53 - material supplemental materials that'll
00:55 - be linked from this video's description
00:56 - so if you've ever made a function in
00:59 - JavaScript you might have done this
01:02 - function you know hello curly bracket
01:07 - curly no parentheses parentheses curly
01:10 - bracket curly bracket if I want to
01:12 - execute this function I want to run that
01:16 - function I would just say hello with the
01:18 - parentheses that means execute this
01:19 - function so now you are probably aware
01:22 - I'm looking for my eraser here it is you
01:25 - are probably aware that in JavaScript
01:29 - functions could be anonymous meaning
01:32 - they don't have to have a name and it
01:34 - can just look like this but then how do
01:40 - you execute the function so typically
01:42 - you might write an anonymous function
01:43 - because you're passing it in somewhere
01:44 - as a callback and somewhere else it's
01:46 - gonna get a reference to it and call it
01:48 - somewhere but in the case of a
01:49 - bookmarklet what a bookmarklet actually
01:52 - is it's a JavaScript function that when
01:54 - you press the button it runs and so a
01:57 - funny thing that you can do if this is
01:59 - the entire right remember if this was
02:01 - named hello then I could execute the
02:05 - function with the name and these two
02:07 - parentheses I can actually just execute
02:09 - the function by putting the two
02:10 - parentheses there so this is like an
02:12 - anonymous
02:13 - self-executing function again I think
02:15 - that's right there's some probably of
02:18 - appropriate technical term for it so
02:19 - this is actually somewhat a bookmarklet
02:21 - actually is and if I just put something
02:24 - like console dot log or alert maybe
02:27 - alert will be a good I think never I
02:29 - have this like mission in life to never
02:31 - ever use a JavaScript alert and I'm
02:32 - gonna somehow I'm gonna do that but I'm
02:35 - gonna break that mission that's it right
02:38 - now so I could say alert you know hello
02:40 - so if this were the code for my
02:42 - bookmarklet whatever the user presses
02:45 - the button or goes to that quote-unquote
02:47 - bookmark this code is gonna execute so
02:52 - this begs the question this is very
02:54 - simple idea a good and and now it's up
02:56 - to you like what do you put in here you
02:57 - can read you this is where you can start
02:59 - parsing and looking at what's on the
03:01 - webpage and changing it in real time
03:02 - with JavaScript but other question is
03:05 - where's this code go so now let's look
03:07 - at that all right so you might be aware
03:10 - that if you go so if you go to a URL and
03:13 - this you don't really see that Chrome by
03:14 - the way is hiding the fact that this is
03:16 - HTTP colon slash slash so I could go to
03:21 - URL by saying HTTP that's I'm saying I
03:24 - want to make an hypertext Transfer
03:26 - Protocol get request to this URL but I
03:28 - can also in the browser look at things
03:30 - that are like files on the computer so I
03:36 - can open up index of HTML and you can
03:38 - see oh look now I'm going to the file
03:40 - colon slash slash but I can actually
03:43 - there is and there's actually like a
03:45 - data path where I can do you know base64
03:48 - encoded images there's all sorts of
03:50 - different kinds of paths that the
03:52 - address bar will accept one of them
03:54 - happens to be JavaScript I let's dare I
03:59 - try to do this function oh I am
04:03 - remembering something that I'm also
04:05 - being told in the chat I made a little
04:07 - mistake here which is that in order for
04:10 - you to execute this function the way
04:12 - that I've described here you actually
04:14 - have to also enclose the entire nameless
04:17 - or anonymous function in parenthesis
04:19 - itself so otherwise it's that's unclear
04:22 - I guess to the interpreter like what
04:24 - this actually match
04:26 - so this is execute the function that's
04:28 - inside these parentheses I'm pretty sure
04:30 - that's required so now let's come back
04:34 - here and so the reason why I saw that's
04:36 - just now I'm going to actually just type
04:37 - that code in right here in the address
04:41 - bar function that's gonna be really hard
04:43 - function curly bracket alert hello
04:51 - semicolon close curly bracket close
04:54 - parentheses parentheses parentheses so
04:56 - this is me saying I want to go to this
04:58 - URL it's JavaScript colon slash slash
05:01 - actually I don't think you need to slash
05:03 - slash if I'm thinking about this I think
05:06 - it's just JavaScript colon and then this
05:09 - code which is a self-executing anonymous
05:11 - function so I'm gonna zoom back out here
05:14 - and I'm going to now hit enter as if I'm
05:17 - loading this web page and I get this
05:19 - alert the page says hello
05:21 - so this that's actually what a
05:24 - bookmarklet is and I wish I had copy
05:26 - pasted that because now all I need to do
05:28 - is I can say I can have a paragraph and
05:31 - I can say I can say hey this is a and I
05:37 - could say a href equals book mark litt
05:42 - all right so look take a look at this
05:44 - now we can see this here now if I click
05:47 - on this nothing happens so what can go
05:50 - in a a what can be the H ref to an a tag
05:54 - it could be a URL it could be it could
06:00 - be lots of things one of the things that
06:02 - can be is actual JavaScript code so for
06:05 - example that same thing that I typed
06:08 - JavaScript colon function oh I need to
06:11 - put a parentheses around the function
06:13 - function parentheses curly bracket alert
06:22 - hello
06:24 - close quote close parenthesis close
06:28 - curly bracket close parentheses execute
06:31 - so now let's try refreshing this page
06:35 - and now whenever I click on that it runs
06:37 - that JavaScript code
06:39 - now guess what if I wanted to bookmark a
06:44 - URL all the whole thing like if I like
06:46 - here I have a bookmark up here to the
06:48 - rainbow topics github repository if I
06:50 - click Edit all this is is a name for
06:54 - this particular URL a bookmarklet is
06:56 - just a named set of JavaScript code so I
07:00 - can now say I can now write if actually
07:05 - what I could I could have created but I
07:06 - can't really just drag this up here and
07:09 - you can see look at that now I have this
07:10 - here and every time you I click on it I
07:13 - get that alert click alert click alert
07:18 - and if I go edit we can see this is just
07:21 - this now its URL encoded it did that for
07:26 - me because a quote is not a valid a
07:30 - valid character in a URL so the this has
07:34 - been URL encoded meaning % 27 you'll
07:36 - often see like % 20 that means space %
07:39 - 27 currently means single quote I think
07:41 - so you can see you can write it this way
07:43 - now so in a way we're done yay we made a
07:47 - bookmarklet but we haven't really done
07:49 - anything yet like here's the thing is
07:52 - this really sustainable is this the
07:54 - thing like oh my goodness and I how am I
07:56 - going to send what if I want to do
07:57 - something really elaborate I want to
07:59 - crawl I want to look at all the content
08:01 - on that web page and I want to find all
08:03 - the paragraph elements and I want to
08:05 - look anytime the word puppy is in there
08:08 - I want to change the word puppy to
08:09 - kitten so it's a it's a bookmarklet that
08:12 - changes puppies the kittens or swap
08:14 - images out or change the background
08:16 - color of every web page to a random
08:18 - color all these things are possible but
08:20 - working with kind of trying to write the
08:23 - code in here is going to be so
08:25 - incredibly awkward like how am I gonna
08:28 - really develop because I can't really
08:29 - have line breaks or spaces very easily
08:31 - here so there is a strategy that is used
08:35 - quite often so the next step that I want
08:37 - to show you is how could I write all of
08:40 - my bookmarklet code in a separate
08:43 - JavaScript file and then simply point to
08:48 - it from here so in other words what I
08:50 - want to say is new file
08:54 - I'm just gonna call it book mark lit a s
09:00 - and then what I want to do is I want to
09:01 - be able to write the bookmarklet in a
09:03 - way that's much like easier for me to
09:05 - follow and debug so for example
09:09 - something that I might do is I might say
09:12 - you know console.log bookmarklet
09:15 - starting and then I might say and now I
09:19 - don't have access to there is a way to
09:21 - gain access to JavaScript libraries like
09:23 - I could have jQuery or p5 be a part of
09:26 - what I'm doing but I'm gonna just do
09:28 - stuff with native JavaScript so I could
09:30 - say for example you know let P
09:33 - paragraphs equal equal document get
09:40 - elements by tag name us P and then I
09:45 - could say for
09:47 - [Music]
09:48 - let I equals 0 I is less than paragraphs
09:54 - length I plus plus and I could say
09:57 - paragraphs index i dot inner HTML equals
10:02 - so this is me like kind of doing a
10:04 - little version of the deletion Esther
10:05 - word list web like we find all the
10:07 - paragraphs on the page and just set
10:09 - their inner HTML to nothing or I could
10:11 - say it's at their inner HTML to kitten
10:13 - so this now if I wanted to I could put
10:16 - all of this into that JavaScript URL and
10:19 - I could like remove all the the I could
10:22 - remove all the white space and probably
10:24 - make it work but what I could do that's
10:26 - a little bit easier is and I'm gonna I'm
10:29 - gonna just type this out on this in this
10:32 - text document for a second
10:35 - down here is I could actually say all
10:40 - right so this is kind of the and I could
10:45 - write that this anonymous function and
10:47 - then what I can do is one of the things
10:51 - you can do in JavaScript is add elements
10:54 - to the web page and so the element that
10:55 - I want to add is a script so I'm going
10:58 - to say let script equal document dot
11:02 - create element script
11:06 - and then what I want to do is I want to
11:09 - add that change the source script source
11:13 - equal to book mark lit a s so I want the
11:21 - source to point to this other JavaScript
11:24 - file and then I want to say
11:27 - document.body.appendchild script so in
11:32 - other words this is kind of some
11:34 - boilerplate code that can basically say
11:37 - any I this just a point to a different
11:41 - javascript file that's gonna have all
11:42 - this other stuff and it tons and tons of
11:44 - code and then just load that and execute
11:47 - that code whenever the bookmarklet is is
11:50 - trigger so this is actually what I
11:53 - wanted to get this right and hopefully I
11:56 - got this right this is what I want to go
12:00 - in here and this is going to be a little
12:04 - tricky to make happen actually what I'm
12:05 - gonna do I'm gonna do this here is now
12:08 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
12:09 - just put this all on one line there
12:14 - might be a way for it to account for
12:15 - line breaks and stuff so I'm gonna take
12:18 - this now and I'm gonna put it in here
12:22 - [Music]
12:24 - let's see if this is really gonna work I
12:28 - didn't close the paragraph tag so let's
12:32 - see what happens here so I am now going
12:35 - to refresh this page I'm going to delete
12:39 - this one up here if you can see that I
12:41 - am going to I'm just gonna like click
12:46 - this okay air for for file not sound so
12:51 - I think there's a look a so there's a
12:53 - little bit of an issue here which is
12:55 - that and I'm gonna get to this if you
12:57 - actually need to host your JavaScript
12:59 - file somewhere and I have one that I
13:01 - already made and hosted somewhere let's
13:02 - see if I can get the one that I so this
13:04 - this won't really work in a sustainable
13:06 - way but what I can do I wonder if it
13:08 - doesn't like the whitespace either but I
13:10 - think more likely right what I need to
13:13 - do is just say this because what I want
13:18 - to do let's just make sure this is the
13:19 - right
13:19 - URL for that javascript code it is
13:24 - there's that JavaScript code of that URL
13:25 - so that that should allow it to point to
13:31 - the actual URL where that JavaScript
13:32 - code is hosted now what I'm gonna do is
13:37 - click this oops I made a really silly
13:44 - error
13:44 - I completely forgot that I need to have
13:46 - this say JavaScript at the beginning
13:48 - just miscellaneous JavaScript code in
13:51 - that URL is not gonna do any good so
13:54 - this has to say JavaScript sorry about
13:56 - that
13:57 - all right so let's try it now I'm gonna
13:59 - click on this bookmarklet and it made a
14:01 - kitten and we see the console log
14:02 - perfect so what I could do is I can now
14:05 - drag this up to here I could go to like
14:08 - my tutorial page I'm now on my tutorial
14:10 - page I'm gonna scroll to the middle
14:12 - somewhere where there's a bunch of
14:13 - paragraphs I'm gonna click the
14:14 - bookmarklet and all the paragraphs now
14:17 - say kitten yes so this is the basic idea
14:20 - of making a bookmarklet what you need to
14:22 - do and it's obviously a little trickier
14:24 - than I thought and you can see actually
14:25 - I actually just copy pasted the code for
14:28 - my tutorial but here it is right here
14:30 - I can just basically all I need to do is
14:34 - have this boilerplate code that points
14:39 - to a JavaScript program that's hosted
14:42 - somewhere and then what it does is that
14:47 - JavaScript program does something parses
14:49 - the web page changes them stuff anything
14:51 - is possible there now there's a couple
14:53 - things I want to mention about this
14:54 - browsers browsers love love love love
14:57 - love to cache your stuff so if I don't
15:02 - know if we're gonna if this is gonna
15:03 - happen but let's see if we can make this
15:04 - happen if I change this now to say puppy
15:09 - right and I go back to and refresh this
15:13 - page and click the bookmarklet like does
15:16 - say puppy so it worked but I've
15:19 - definitely been in a situation where I
15:20 - changed the code and the bookmarklet
15:23 - didn't actually update when it when I
15:26 - when I executed it so way that you can
15:28 - get around this I actually have it here
15:31 - in this tutorial so I'll just come in
15:33 - you
15:33 - to add a kind of arbitrary URL argument
15:37 - which is like the turn date and time
15:41 - which will force it'll make the URL
15:43 - appear different to the page that's
15:45 - loading the JavaScript code and will
15:46 - force it to reload so I'm gonna leave
15:48 - that out of adding that in but you can
15:50 - when I publish the code for this example
15:52 - I'll include that as part of the code
15:55 - now what I've shown you so far it
15:58 - doesn't really do you any good what I
16:00 - least what I'm going to do is I'm going
16:02 - to show you this is actually a piece of
16:07 - JavaScript code that's basically the
16:08 - same thing that just takes all the
16:10 - paragraphs and changes their background
16:12 - color to some purple so the way that you
16:15 - really want to do this is you want to
16:17 - host your JavaScript code somewhere
16:18 - permanent and then what you want is for
16:21 - the bookmarklet
16:23 - to reference not like referencing
16:26 - localhost is no good it's gonna work on
16:28 - my computer but you want to reference a
16:30 - URL that's actually out there somewhere
16:32 - in the cloud the nice thing about this
16:34 - is as people use your bookmarklet I mean
16:38 - there's a there is a sort of security
16:39 - question here you can change your
16:41 - bookmarklets code and they don't have to
16:43 - reinstall it because the the actual code
16:46 - that they have in the bookmarklet is
16:47 - just pointing to another javascript file
16:49 - and that javascript file can be updated
16:50 - ok so maybe I'll come back and do a
16:52 - coding challenge over but so sending
16:54 - your creative bookmarklets that change
16:57 - images the kittens or puppies or
16:58 - rainbows and unicorns or whatever and
17:01 - all sorts of unserved more creative
17:03 - ideas than what i can think of right now
17:04 - but I'm gonna now move into Chrome
17:07 - extensions we can do I'm gonna start by
17:09 - making a Chrome extension that does
17:11 - exactly the same thing but with this
17:13 - kind of code that alters your view of a
17:15 - web page in a Chrome extension there's
17:17 - going to be a lot more possibilities of
17:19 - what you can do beyond that ok so thanks
17:21 - for watching this bookmarklet tutorial
17:23 - and I'll see you in the next one
17:29 - [Music]
