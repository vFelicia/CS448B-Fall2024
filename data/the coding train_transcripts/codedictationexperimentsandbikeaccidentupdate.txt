00:02 - hello good afternoon welcome to a
00:05 - special surprise sort of episode of the
00:09 - coding train I happened to be here at
00:12 - NYU for a couple meetings today
00:14 - oops I'm looking over here and so I
00:17 - thought I would pop up here to the
00:19 - studio and do a quick little experiment
00:22 - I've been as some of you might been
00:25 - following my channel I had a bicycle
00:27 - accident and I have a bunch of different
00:29 - broken body parts most seriously here
00:32 - this elbow this is actually now a splint
00:34 - which is different than I was wearing in
00:35 - the last video that I made and this
00:38 - actually comes off and I've started
00:39 - physical therapy but I've got another
00:40 - few weeks to be wearing these things it
00:43 - looks like I could maybe type but it's
00:44 - pretty uncomfortable and not the best
00:46 - thing for my body so I'm still holding
00:49 - off on doing typing I'm hearing an echo
00:51 - because I have a monitor I would love to
00:55 - know if the sound is okay I'm just gonna
00:59 - turn off this okay so that should get
01:02 - rid of the echo so I have something that
01:06 - I've installed on my computer here and
01:08 - I'm gonna do a quick experiment here
01:10 - wake up hello coding trained viewers how
01:18 - are you today
01:21 - it didn't work
01:22 - oh I'm in the wrong application try this
01:27 - again hello coding trained viewers oh
01:33 - shoot this was working so well this
01:37 - worked a minute ago let me try to open
01:39 - up TextEdit and
01:52 - hello Kotick trained viewers correct
01:57 - Kody's coding trained correct
02:04 - reviewers viewers exclamation mark
02:14 - [Music]
02:16 - so this I've been using a bunch of
02:20 - different dictation software I'm just
02:21 - gonna leave this on to be amused by how
02:23 - its following what I'm saying and
02:27 - getting lots of things wrong Mac OS has
02:32 - built-in dictation the software that
02:34 - I've installed here is actually called
02:36 - dragon speaks naturally and there is the
02:39 - sound might be a little bit loud okay
02:41 - this is a different microphone setup and
02:44 - I'm gonna oh yeah it's way up way up and
02:46 - turn the mic down okay is that better
02:50 - okay so high for Cody's viewers okay
02:53 - so what was I going to say I watched
02:59 - this YouTube video the other day I'm
03:01 - gonna try to pull it up here let me see
03:03 - open Chrome Google coding by voice
03:13 - Python Python correct pika I gotta get
03:25 - you this let me oops oh my goodness it's
03:29 - opening up eclipse there's a ghost in
03:31 - the machine you should open up a guy I'd
03:33 - still go to sleep oh and now is it too
03:43 - quiet
03:43 - no I see the levels are fine so scratch
03:48 - that
03:52 - by the way if you haven't watched my
03:54 - channel before it this is what I do it
03:56 - would have made sense for me to like set
03:58 - this up practice it and figure out an
04:00 - actual way to get it to work instead I
04:02 - just installed it and thought to come up
04:03 - here turn on a light public stream which
04:05 - apparently has some number of people
04:07 - watching right now like 500 to 26 while
04:10 - I'm fumbling my way through this okay
04:24 - go to sleep okay so you can see when I
04:28 - say go to sleep I can't do my typical
04:31 - actually maybe I can this right here
04:35 - wake up go to sleep so I need to
04:41 - remember to do that and to wake it up
04:42 - when I want to actually dictate wake up
04:53 - coding by voice YouTube's correct code E
05:01 - coding go to sleep oh yeah so this is a
05:13 - YouTube video that I will pull up so I
05:21 - recommend anybody watching if you're
05:24 - interested to watch this video
05:26 - Tavis Rudd is a developer who mostly
05:31 - programs in Python who had a rock
05:33 - climbing injury he tells the story in
05:36 - this video and set up a very elaborate
05:38 - system to do everything with dictation
05:41 - and in fact he continues to use this
05:43 - system today even though he's mostly I
05:45 - believe recovered and Ken type but he
05:48 - still does everything by voice now he
05:50 - used an open source API that I forget
05:53 - what it's called but it's in this video
05:55 - that works with dragon speaks he uses
05:58 - Emacs and vim which are specialized text
06:02 - editors that you can use in a terminal
06:05 - window so I haven't done any of this but
06:09 - I I'm curious you know fit but you know
06:12 - this may take a while to setup and I
06:13 - would love any help with this if
06:15 - anybody's interested okay could raise
06:22 - the volume a little bit sorry I'm gonna
06:23 - just turn the volume up a little bit now
06:26 - on my mic got distracted by the chat in
06:29 - that message let's see how that is it's
06:31 - a little bit up now okay so I watched
06:35 - this video I've been looking into
06:37 - kind of interested in trying to do a
06:38 - similar setup just as an experiment so I
06:41 - thought I would try to do today very
06:44 - briefly see how far I could get with
06:49 - just what's in Dragon speaks by itself
06:53 - without any additional settings or
06:55 - macros or interfacing with an API and
06:59 - the processing development environment
07:01 - ultimately I might like to try to set up
07:04 - to work with like atom text editor maybe
07:06 - atom live preview something like that
07:09 - clearly these systems I've been using it
07:11 - to send emails they it works remarkably
07:13 - well to dictate written English so
07:18 - something that I might write in an email
07:19 - or a word processing document even
07:23 - filling out a form in a webpage the
07:25 - dictation works quite well it also has
07:27 - some commands to operate the computer
07:29 - that I haven't really learned yet so we
07:30 - need to learn those but it is absolutely
07:34 - not set up in any way to do coding so
07:37 - some of the things that I imagine I'm
07:38 - gonna meet to you do like curly braces
07:40 - and variable names with camelcase or
07:43 - underscores it's not going to do any of
07:45 - that in an elegant way natively so I
07:47 - thought I would try to see what it could
07:48 - do what all the pitfalls are and maybe
07:52 - make a mental list or maybe some of you
07:54 - are watching could kind of take notes
07:55 - and send me a list of what are all the
07:56 - features that I might need and most of
07:58 - these features have been solved and
08:00 - implemented by Tavis run if you watch
08:02 - this video does this like almost wild
08:04 - performance of this strange language
08:05 - that he's invented to talk to his
08:07 - computer and but I'm kind of and maybe I
08:11 - could piggyback off of that system in
08:12 - some ways but I thought I would kind of
08:14 - start over a little bit from scratch
08:15 - here okay so I'm looking at this let me
08:19 - just come over some people are asking in
08:20 - the chat I'm gonna walk over here to the
08:22 - whiteboard just to explain here what's
08:24 - going on so first of all I have pretty
08:26 - good my shoulders are perfectly healthy
08:28 - and I can move around I have a what's it
08:31 - called scaphoid is that that's not the
08:32 - right word a very small fracture in this
08:36 - wrist from a bicycle accident it will
08:40 - hopefully heal on its own and in about a
08:43 - few weeks this will come off and I will
08:45 - do some physical therapy but hopefully
08:47 - this will just pretty much be fine
08:49 - good as new so to speak within the next
08:51 - few weeks the more serious injury is
08:54 - here this elbow I learned all the names
08:58 - of the bones and the different things
08:59 - but googling I've got can't come up with
09:02 - any of them on the fly right now but the
09:03 - elbow bone broke really split off right
09:07 - in half detached itself this way
09:10 - so this tricep muscle wasn't not
09:13 - attached to anything and so it's been
09:15 - repaired with surgery I have some
09:17 - artificial bone I have a metal plate I
09:19 - have a couple screws and this is
09:21 - actually a splint for protection to hold
09:23 - it in place but this actually comes off
09:25 - and I do physical therapy three or four
09:27 - times a day and what I thought I'd try
09:29 - to program was a simulation of the range
09:30 - of motion that I have so currently if I
09:32 - use this arm you know I can extend it
09:35 - all the way I actually can hyper extend
09:36 - it but this would be zero degrees this
09:38 - is maybe about 160 degrees something in
09:40 - radians my range of motion if I were to
09:42 - take this off and try to do the physical
09:43 - therapy now which I quote is currently
09:46 - about sorry it's about 15 degrees I can
09:52 - get to about here 15 degrees and then I
09:55 - can't this is much harder so I can get
09:56 - to about 125 degrees and so I'm hoping
09:59 - to get all the way back to 0-3 around
10:01 - 160 and this will take quite a bit of
10:04 - time the physical therapy so that's my
10:07 - current status I have taken let me say
10:09 - another couple things I basically taking
10:11 - this month July off I did one live
10:14 - stream from my apartment just to say hi
10:16 - to the channel and I'm doing this today
10:17 - maybe for another half an hour or so but
10:19 - I'm pausing for those of you who are
10:21 - supporting me on patreon that's
10:22 - patreon.com slash coding train I'm going
10:25 - to put it on pause so none of your
10:28 - donations will be taken for this month
10:30 - of course if you would like to anyway
10:32 - you're welcome to make a contribution
10:34 - the best way to do that is through
10:36 - nature of code comm which is I have an
10:38 - online system for purchasing a book but
10:39 - what I would suggest in lieu of the
10:41 - patreon contributions this month if
10:43 - you're looking to support something to
10:45 - make a donation to processing foundation
10:47 - org so you can check that out I also as
10:49 - an experiment enabled that YouTube super
10:52 - chat which I'll probably just turn off
10:53 - but since I'm experimented with so many
10:56 - different things today I thought I would
10:57 - see how that works
10:58 - I kind of have mixed feelings about the
11:00 - whole super chat system I don't
11:01 - I don't particularly like the idea of
11:04 - paid chat messages and I want to go on a
11:08 - long discussion of that but I thought I
11:09 - would turn it on and see and then I'll
11:11 - probably turn it off again because the
11:13 - crowdfunding that I'm using mostly for
11:15 - this channel is oh actually exclusively
11:16 - is through patreon service okay
11:19 - that aside Kody in the chat whoops
11:25 - Kody in the chat asks does anybody know
11:28 - how long Dan won't be able to type I'm
11:33 - hopeful my you know as much as I love
11:36 - doing this YouTube channel and it is it
11:38 - brings me so much happiness to be able
11:41 - to be here and do this my alt my my main
11:44 - goal is to be able to be back and typing
11:47 - by the fall semester which is early
11:49 - September
11:51 - III think I need at least a few more
11:53 - weeks of rest healing and physical
11:55 - therapy before I'm gonna have more
11:58 - significant use of these arms you know I
12:01 - can kind of do some one finger typing
12:03 - I've been doing dictation for emails but
12:05 - we'll see it'll be a while before I'm
12:06 - you know sitting for I certainly don't
12:08 - think that I can sit for hours at a
12:10 - stretch typing you know it's probably
12:13 - not the best thing in terms of you know
12:15 - the kind of exercises in use of the arm
12:17 - that I should be rebuilding okay so I
12:19 - don't actually know the answer to that
12:20 - but I will be happy to provide updates
12:22 - I'm gonna be out of town next week
12:24 - having a nice little break and vacation
12:26 - and then I'll be back in town and having
12:29 - more physical therapy and doctor's
12:30 - appointments so we'll see if anybody
12:32 - wants to see my x-rays you can follow me
12:34 - at shipment on Twitter I posted them if
12:36 - you want to join my patreon I posted
12:38 - some more pictures of the scar and
12:41 - swelling that you probably don't want to
12:43 - see but if about this now okay scratch
12:47 - that going sleep I should be nice to
12:52 - dragon so then go to sleep sounds very
12:54 - like command like I need to like rework
12:56 - I like to be very polite good thoughtful
12:59 - what apologize a lot I need to work on
13:00 - that with my dictation stuff okay
13:04 - somebody posted voice code dot IO I'm
13:07 - not active on Instagram now okay so what
13:12 - time is it now first I have another
13:13 - thing
13:15 - shoot okay wait
13:19 - somebody created a new song it's on
13:25 - soundcloud it was based on the
13:30 - minesweeper it was a play on it's
13:34 - flood-fill time I just forgot how it was
13:37 - it's in a youtube comment maybe I can
13:40 - find it sound cloud somebody can find it
13:48 - for me and then give me the URL in slack
13:52 - that would be great
13:55 - I'm gonna look for it in YouTube
13:57 - comments cuz I think I have a way of
13:59 - doing that here so I can play this song
14:04 - I'm going on this computer
14:05 - Oh somebody found it already thank you
14:08 - alright cuz I had shared it so i ke - b
14:13 - is h o P I am typing right now just
14:17 - using one finger on each hand so it's
14:20 - very slow and let's see it's let's
14:25 - whoops let's play this one oh you can't
14:32 - hear it I have to change some settings
14:34 - here sound loop back no multi output
14:43 - device I think I need to do that
14:57 - maybe you can hear it but it's very
14:58 - quiet
15:15 - yeah I know I have to change the
15:17 - settings you can listen to this on your
15:19 - own time it's very quiet well maybe I'll
15:24 - come back to it later okay so let's see
15:26 - how this goes now but thank you like
15:32 - bishop I love these remixes and I should
15:35 - let you know that there's a new theme
15:39 - song coming a music video I shot all
15:42 - that with some collaborators which I'll
15:45 - post about before I had this
15:46 - so I fully used to my arm then okay so
15:50 - let's see here so I'm now in processing
15:59 - so let's see if I can get some stuff
16:01 - happening here people in the chat are
16:06 - asking why so much off-topic discussion
16:09 - I don't know if you're asking me that
16:10 - question
16:11 - or asking the chat question but
16:14 - unfortunately those of you who are here
16:16 - to hope that my neural network series is
16:18 - continuing and hope that I'm gonna do a
16:20 - lot of coding I apologize I'm sincerely
16:23 - sorry you're just gonna have to wait on
16:25 - that I probably won't be back I
16:27 - definitely won't be back until August
16:28 - with any of that content and it could be
16:30 - a little bit later depending on how
16:31 - things go I've decided that this month
16:34 - July is just a kind of month hiatus but
16:36 - I thought since I was here I would try
16:38 - to turn this on and and say hi and do a
16:40 - little bit of stuff so so here we go
16:46 - let's see wake up void setup oh I'm in
16:56 - the wrong void setup I'm getting okay
17:02 - hold on why is this happening let me
17:05 - relaunch processing it was typing and it
17:08 - was I was I did actually test and it was
17:11 - dictating into processing earlier and
17:16 - not sure why it doesn't want to do that
17:18 - now using the mouse is definitely the
17:23 - hardest thing the trackpad that is
17:38 - Kancil correction go to sleep I know it
17:44 - happened I was in the correction mode oh
17:48 - I turned off my mic
18:14 - you
18:29 - you
18:52 - okay now I'm back okay okay okay I'm
18:58 - back
18:59 - did you guys hear me answer the question
19:02 - about why so many off-topic discussions
19:06 - was the mic just making noise oh boy all
19:12 - right
19:12 - I don't know what I had the mic I'm all
19:15 - messed up what a disaster okay
19:22 - [Music]
19:28 - did I talk about the music video that's
19:31 - coming that I talk did you hear me talk
19:33 - about that I'm not doing the neural
19:35 - network stuff for a while because of
19:37 - this etc I can't yeah okay and I'm
19:41 - getting some very good advice which is
19:43 - don't necessarily rely on the YouTube
19:46 - chat for sound feedback as i okay so I
19:50 - don't know why I'm not able to get the
19:55 - dictation to work in processing let me
19:57 - see
19:58 - wake up void setup okay so maybe I need
20:06 - to question mark
20:16 - okay also only certain applications are
20:22 - supported what does it mean you can
20:27 - dictate into an unsupported application
20:29 - if you want to dictate into an
20:30 - application that's not on the supported
20:31 - list but try not to use your keyboard or
20:34 - mouse I see that's going to be a problem
20:39 - because I'm definitely gonna whoops all
20:46 - right let's don't it
20:51 - all right let's figure this out maybe if
20:59 - I relaunch it
21:05 - so you guys just have to bear with me
21:07 - here for a second oh so sad oh there we
21:14 - go
21:18 - scratch that
21:23 - scratch that correct Seth area correct
21:31 - Seth as soon as I clicked my mouth my
21:38 - mouse it stopped allowing me to dictate
21:41 - oh that's so sad well here's problem
21:45 - number one open processing open Adam
21:57 - open Adam
22:09 - let's try this well this is going to be
22:12 - a failure
22:14 - correct be a failure
22:16 - be a success exclamation mark new line
22:24 - scratch that
22:33 - all right now now the thing is I'm a
22:39 - little bit concerned that if I new line
22:44 - if I start to use the mouse to delete
22:49 - something let's try that I'm going to do
22:51 - command a go to sleep wake up test one
23:00 - two three okay
23:02 - so already I'm having better success
23:04 - with Adam okay I have an idea
23:09 - go to sleep wake up open terminal C D
23:25 - slash tilde slash users oh no no I don't
23:39 - need that desktop PWD new line PWD new
23:52 - line p WD new line you're lying
24:04 - [Music]
24:09 - go to sleep okay so I the reason why I
24:14 - wanted to attempt this experiment with
24:16 - processing is that it was it's an
24:18 - all-in-one environment and I wasn't
24:20 - going to have to switch between the
24:22 - browser and the text editor but let's
24:24 - try doing this in Chrome let's start
24:27 - doing this okay so I want to go open
24:31 - Chrome Oh wake up wake up go to open
24:38 - Chrome open Chrome go to sleep do I have
24:49 - to be in the finder how do i how do I
24:52 - get to the Dragon commands if I'm not if
25:00 - I don't want to be dictating it to
25:01 - terminal open Chrome wake up open Chrome
25:21 - how many viewers have I lost now there's
25:23 - probably nobody watching anymore okay
25:28 - correct flagrantly oh my god fascinating
25:34 - this is fascinating to see how the
25:38 - software works and what kind of it's not
25:40 - free software and this is a dragon
25:42 - naturally speaking trollese go to sleep
25:46 - go to sleep
25:54 - okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
25:56 - to open up Chrome
25:58 - and I'm going to go to p5.js org
26:02 - and we go to download and I'm gonna
26:05 - download p5.js complete and gonna go
26:10 - find this I'm gonna open this up and I'm
26:15 - gonna get empty example and I'm going to
26:19 - put it on the desktop then I'm gonna go
26:24 - to Adam and I'm gonna say open desktop
26:33 - empty example and sketch touch yes
26:40 - okay this is good I'm gonna delete
26:42 - everything now I'm gonna go back to
26:46 - terminal
26:47 - oh I'm standing in front of this wake up
26:58 - Python space - M - M
27:16 - simple is it case sensitive let's see
27:24 - yeah go to sleep so already I need some
27:34 - sort of so if anyone's making a list for
27:39 - me to keep track of things that I need
27:41 - to investigate if I'm actually going to
27:43 - do this two things is one
27:45 - why doesn't processing work with dragon
27:48 - and insider' a way that I can get it to
27:50 - two is what is a way for me to write
27:54 - some sort of macro command
27:56 - I need I could just say start server to
28:00 - drag in and it's going to automatically
28:01 - launch the server and then I need to be
28:09 - able to figure out a way if I'm in atom
28:12 - two with a command my goal here would be
28:17 - as a experiment as an academic
28:18 - experiment here you know I'm I have some
28:22 - use of my hands but what would it what
28:24 - would it mean to code without any use of
28:26 - hands whatsoever I need to do everything
28:28 - completely for voice how would I get
28:32 - from Adam to Chrome Oh voice code dot IO
28:38 - Simon in the chat is suggesting how
28:41 - interesting I will have to take a look
28:43 - at that I will take a look at that I
28:45 - mean I'm not going to purchase it right
28:48 - now voice code dot IO advanced voice
28:56 - control platform interesting okay I'm
29:00 - going to take a look at this later so
29:03 - that's interesting
29:07 - so if I go now to localhost oops I did
29:12 - it on the desktop that's fine desktop
29:15 - empty example and if I open up the
29:27 - console okay
29:30 - so now if I go back to Adam I definitely
29:35 - need a way of triggering command s so
29:43 - how do i with dragon switch to finder I
29:48 - don't know so switch to Chrome instead
29:51 - of open Chrome let's try that wake up
29:54 - switch to Chrome go to sleep so that
30:01 - didn't seem to work so if anyone wants
30:04 - to look at the Dragon documentation and
30:06 - help me out here give me some tips
30:08 - switch between Windows with naturally
30:10 - speaking you can say switch to to change
30:13 - the window I'm getting that message in
30:17 - the chat okay we are here to waste time
30:24 - with this useless voice app yes so if
30:27 - you're not interested in that
30:28 - thanks for watching I switched to Google
30:31 - Chrome okay wake up
30:33 - switch to Google Chrome hmm that didn't
30:41 - seem to work either
30:42 - scratch that go to sleep
30:50 - all right okay here let's give this a
30:58 - try okay
30:58 - wake up function setup correct so setup
31:09 - choose to open paren close paren curly
31:19 - brace scratch that open curly bracket
31:26 - new line new line create canvas correct
31:36 - create campus create canvas create
31:44 - canvas create canvas scratch that
31:51 - scratch that scratch that create canvas
32:04 - hmm
32:05 - so good sleep okay so here's item number
32:09 - two I need say start Google Chrome I'll
32:13 - try that so I need to come up with a way
32:19 - of stringing words together without
32:23 - spaces and using camel case and I know
32:26 - again with the video that I referenced
32:28 - the tavis rudd video this is all
32:30 - something that he worked out for coding
32:32 - in Python right now I'm just making a
32:33 - mental list of things so I need to be
32:35 - able to say create canvas and I probably
32:38 - could also just create I could probably
32:40 - pull the p5 API and like put that in as
32:44 - a bunch of like add that to a dictionary
32:46 - I can probably work through instance
32:47 - from sort of training yeah so there's
32:49 - probably way too fine I'm getting this
32:54 - I'm getting this this folio a way to
32:56 - define a dictionary so switch to next
33:02 - window list
33:03 - all windows okay wake up list all
33:08 - windows list all windows scratch that
33:15 - scratch that go to sleep so that didn't
33:20 - seem to work either yeah
33:22 - scratch that scratch that the scratch
33:24 - that song never forget the scratch
33:27 - that's mmm wake up open parentheses 6:40
33:36 - comma 480 go to end correct 4480 correct
33:49 - 4480 go to end go to sleep so how do I
34:01 - move the cursor around I mean I can
34:03 - obviously do that with the arrow keys so
34:07 - that's another if anyone's keeping a
34:08 - track of this list how I move the cursor
34:10 - around is something that I need to be
34:13 - able to do wake up semicolon go to end
34:25 - go to sleep so go to end is something
34:29 - that I was using when dictating emails
34:30 - and other things were it would
34:32 - immediately move the cursor to the end
34:33 - but that didn't seem to work okay here
34:38 - wake up function background open paren
34:44 - close paren open curly braket new line
34:51 - correct background draw go to sleep so
34:59 - weirdly I've noticed this is another bug
35:01 - that seems to be in dragon when I tell
35:03 - it to correct something it kind of
35:04 - selects the wrong area it you notice how
35:07 - it's selected it missed the B and it
35:09 - selected the parenthesis so I don't know
35:12 - if that's just because Adam is not
35:14 - technically supported so it wasn't able
35:17 - to select
35:17 - the right thing okay
35:20 - wake up background open paren 51
35:34 - semicolon newline fill open friend
35:43 - correct fill whoa okay so it lost
35:49 - correct fill choose to open paren 255
36:04 - semicolon newline ellipse
36:13 - scratch that rect mode all right so a
36:25 - whoa go to sleep so another thing is to
36:34 - again this built-in dictionary if we're
36:37 - camel casing because what if I want to
36:39 - create like write a function or declare
36:41 - a variable that doesn't exist but then
36:44 - also have a built-in list of words those
36:46 - are two of the things I need wake up all
36:54 - caps Center go to sleep that work pretty
37:00 - well I know it's not going to understand
37:03 - this wake up open paren Mouse X correct
37:14 - now Mouse comma Mouse Y comma 16 comma
37:26 - 16
37:32 - so again I have the same scratch that go
37:39 - to sleep go to sleep go to sleep go to
37:44 - sleep I know that's the children's song
37:46 - it's I listened to that have with my
37:50 - kids Elizabeth Mitchell sings it go to
37:53 - sleep go to sleep go to sleep my
37:56 - something I can't remember the words
38:01 - close curly bracket
38:06 - wake up close curly bracket go to sleep
38:16 - now there must be a way that I can do
38:19 - command s there go to sleep my there
38:25 - must be a way don't correct the word you
38:31 - said there must be a way for me to say
38:37 - command s right for save now I can
38:40 - actually just type this in and it will
38:42 - auto format
38:43 - I have Adam configure to auto format the
38:45 - code which is nice like all that white
38:47 - space errors I don't really care about
38:49 - but there should be a way for me to say
38:50 - command s then I should be able to say
38:53 - switch what if I go here to commands
38:57 - help
39:03 - help oh I'm in the correction window
39:07 - correction window okay
39:11 - so these are all the well it's like
39:15 - Safari okay so I'm gonna have to look
39:18 - wake up global applications I'm sorry
39:24 - that the font there's no way you guys
39:25 - can read this activate it looks like the
39:28 - word is activate activate Adam or wake
39:32 - up
39:33 - activate Adam activate Chrome activate
39:38 - Adam activate Chrome activate Adam
39:43 - activate Chrome's quick photos thank you
39:55 - scratch that go to sleep I wanted to
40:02 - talk to me why I want to talk to me I'm
40:04 - talking to it I'm being as nice as I can
40:07 - alright that's good now how do I do
40:10 - command s commands a global menu
40:19 - navigation click click file menu but
40:24 - there's got a way to click save choose
40:27 - file close window copy selection go to
40:31 - beginning go to end save would be under
40:36 - s save this document okay
40:43 - wake up new line your line
40:52 - safest document Oh go sleep it did it
41:00 - wake up
41:02 - activate Chrome refresh this page that
41:12 - was a fantasy that that would work go to
41:17 - sleep I have a feeling that it's gonna
41:19 - be happier with me using Safari just
41:21 - based on the fact that I saw so far II
41:23 - show up but I don't know that I could
41:24 - bring myself to do that okay so I can
41:30 - hit refresh hey move mouse I can move
41:41 - the mouse with my one finger Oh dragon
41:42 - quit unexpectedly reopen so that's my
41:53 - quota challenge for today through
41:55 - dictation I was able to use p5.js to
42:00 - create a simple program of moving the
42:02 - mouse around now I wanted to try to
42:04 - simulate my range of motion so I'm
42:12 - seeing um so what time is it - 15 I've
42:17 - got to go
42:18 - by 2:30 because I have some meetings so
42:22 - let's see if I can get a little further
42:23 - and maybe answer some questions I don't
42:26 - know what else I could do no coming back
42:27 - another time
42:30 - okay so let's see here let me think
42:33 - about this
42:34 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
42:35 - draw a line that is you know what I
42:39 - should do when I'm doing my physical
42:41 - therapy is I should monitor my physical
42:43 - therapy with a Kinect and actually
42:45 - measure the angle so that's something
42:46 - I'll do eventually that's a good idea
42:48 - right cuz the Kinect should be able to
42:50 - determine the angle for the range of
42:52 - motion that I'm getting here I have to
42:54 - work on that once I get up and once they
42:56 - get up and running with this whole
42:58 - programming education thing
43:03 - [Music]
43:05 - okay so let's see here so let me delete
43:11 - this wake up Oh
43:15 - microphones off stroke open paren 2255
43:23 - correct 25 to 55 go to end end of line
43:30 - Oh choose 1 go to end so this has to be
43:44 - low go to sleep
43:47 - this has to be lower case wake up
43:54 - new line line open paren 360 comma 240
44:10 - comma 400 comma 240 new line
44:21 - float a equals correct floats choose
44:29 - three correct equals equals equals
44:37 - symbol scratch that equal sign go to
44:50 - sleep
44:50 - say I've learned that equal sign is what
44:53 - I have to say for equals which I should
44:55 - probably alter the settings so that I
44:57 - just have to say equals that's another
44:59 - thing so altering some of these settings
45:01 - oh I mean I've been job that's correct
45:04 - I forgot oh they care camera still goes
45:06 - off camera on look at that neck
45:11 - dictation suddenly worked with that
45:12 - camera amazing wake up
45:16 - correct floats select floats
45:23 - go to sleep yeah so this is it being off
45:27 - so I've seen this behavior this seems
45:29 - like a bug to me I don't think I'm doing
45:31 - anything wrong notice that it selected
45:33 - the correct number of characters but in
45:34 - the wrong place it should select this
45:36 - float so why is it not working I don't
45:40 - know wake up bar
45:54 - scratch that shoot go to sleep so the
46:04 - other thing is I'm often in that correct
46:06 - mode how do I cancel that correct mode
46:11 - let's try this again wake up var a equal
46:19 - sign map choose to open paren Mouse X
46:35 - comma 0 comma width correct 0 choose to
46:48 - correct width
46:51 - choose 2 comma 15 comma 125 correct now
47:10 - thanks Mouse X so I have to figure out a
47:18 - way scratch that
47:20 - go to sleep so I have to figure out a
47:25 - way to there's probably way I could
47:26 - spell that out if in a custom way but
47:29 - again that's the sort of dictionary
47:30 - thing I mean I I said var hey witch why
47:32 - not keep that but I meant this to be a
47:34 - so what I'm doing here is I'm trying to
47:36 - map the mouse position to a range of
47:40 - angles which is currently yesterday my
47:43 - physical therapy this is the range of
47:45 - motion that was measured so I was able
47:46 - to get to about 15 degrees to about 125
47:51 - degrees that's I'm not actually it's
47:53 - more like this probably and I you know I
47:55 - want to get to 0 and I want to get to
47:57 - about you know probably 160 okay so now
48:05 - [Music]
48:12 - so one thing I want to do now that I'm
48:14 - gonna use rotation I don't want I want
48:16 - to draw this line relative to 0-0 I
48:19 - think that'll be nicer so I'm gonna say
48:24 - I'm gonna add and wake up translate open
48:29 - paren with / - comma height / - close
48:32 - paren semicolon go to sleep all right so
48:40 - that's interesting I got with / - they
48:44 - probably should have said with / - maybe
48:46 - that would have worked wake up correct
48:51 - with / - with / - correct with choose to
49:03 - correct tightened by my - height / - go
49:13 - to sleep okay so I'm learning getting
49:17 - closer
49:18 - oops you lazy the dictate so I'm gonna
49:21 - change the line to go from like negative
49:23 - 100 to zero - zero zero and then now
49:37 - wake up line open paren zero comma zero
49:42 - 100 comma zero
49:47 - scratch that zero comma zero comma 100
49:54 - comma zero correct choose - it actually
50:01 - gave me the full option of what I wanted
50:04 - scratch that
50:08 - zero comma zero comma 100 comma zero
50:14 - correct that choose to correct why
50:26 - scratch that scratch that
50:30 - put that back go to sleep oh my god this
50:38 - is not working at all I just curious
50:43 - there's got its got to be like less than
50:45 - 200 people watching at this point with
50:50 - you go outside smell the flowers give
50:56 - somebody a hug appreciate things besides
50:59 - me here okay alright alright
51:04 - oh yeah let me let me get back to things
51:05 - all right let me wake up whine
51:12 - open-paren
51:15 - zero comma zero 100 comma zero choose
51:20 - two
51:26 - save this document activate Chrome
51:34 - activate Google Chrome localhost go to
51:47 - sleep so I need some way of immediately
51:53 - going to localhost and navigating
51:54 - somehow to the web application that I
51:57 - want to look at again if I was just
51:59 - doing this in processing I'll just need
52:00 - to say run run stop or play stop that
52:04 - kind of thing but since I couldn't get
52:07 - that to work here we are uncaught syntax
52:13 - error sketch das line 12 wake up
52:17 - activate atom
52:26 - I know sleep I need a comma here wake up
52:34 - wake up comma save this document
52:41 - activate Chrome refresh that didn't work
52:49 - so I don't know how to refresh with a
52:51 - command ok there is there is the line ok
52:57 - we're doing well now rotate open paren a
53:07 - closed paren semicolon correct a go to
53:17 - sleep so that needs to be a lowercase a
53:20 - just probably wait for me to say that
53:22 - and this should be the word rotate so
53:25 - obviously I'm still doing way too much
53:26 - with one hand here and I'm kind of
53:30 - running out of time here but let's see
53:33 - how this open let's see how this goes
53:38 - and by the way you might be wondering
53:41 - why am I looking this way whenever I
53:43 - start talking it's because I have a
53:44 - monitor over here that has exactly what
53:48 - you see it's it's so that I can do this
53:50 - and I can say I'm pointing to line I'm
53:51 - pointing to rotate a pointing to VAR a
53:53 - but for some reason I I really what I
53:55 - need is a monitor up there so that I can
53:57 - look more like I'm talking to you but
54:00 - for some reason I have this habit of
54:01 - just looking at the screen over here
54:02 - which is a little bit weird okay let's
54:07 - see and wake up save this document and
54:17 - activate Chrome Oh didn't wake up wake
54:24 - up save this document activate Chrome
54:36 - go to sleep so whatever my refresh
54:39 - command would be mmm so so my angle is
54:44 - wrong right so I actually don't want
54:47 - this is this is not what my harm does I
54:49 - want it to go from so this is the thing
54:52 - I always forget in a computer graphics
54:55 - system pointing down is positive
54:58 - pointing up is negative and rotation
55:01 - right this is rotating 15 degrees so I
55:07 - actually want to be between negative 15
55:09 - degrees and negative a negative 1/25
55:14 - wake up activate atom go to sleep so in
55:22 - the interest of time this by the way
55:26 - should say so this should be between
55:30 - negative 125 and negative 15 and guess
55:35 - what
55:36 - also what are these measurements in
55:39 - these measurements are in degrees
55:41 - natively most computer programs graphics
55:44 - programs will think of angles in terms
55:46 - of radians so I actually need to add
55:48 - something else
55:49 - wake up a new line angle mode didn't
55:56 - even wake it up wake up you little
55:59 - sleepyhead wake up new line angle mode
56:07 - open paren caps degrees
56:17 - choose to correct all caps degrees Scrat
56:30 - novice go to sleep go to sleep please
56:37 - please just go to sleep okay
56:40 - I'm gonna manually put it to sleep it's
56:43 - frozen
56:44 - once again dragon has crashed I have
56:46 - successfully crashed dragon press the
56:49 - key f5 to refresh look under commands so
56:53 - f5 is refresh okay
56:55 - unfortunately dragon has died maybe I
56:58 - can force quit it I think I just have to
57:04 - wait for it to die so yeah it's died
57:15 - that's very sad
57:36 - talk amongst yourselves whoops
57:51 - okay let's take a look at this does this
57:53 - seem right now draw that first line
57:56 - which is this part of the arm change the
58:01 - angle mode map the mouse two angles and
58:03 - degrees rotate and then draw another
58:05 - line Wow
58:11 - there's got to be a way to hold on I
58:15 - should be able to probably force quit it
58:18 - with this oh it came back alive
58:29 - wake up
58:30 - scratch that go to sleep so
58:38 - unfortunately I woke it had some sort of
58:41 - glitch there woke up etc etc and and I
58:49 - lost what I did I'm just gonna type it
58:52 - in manually because I'm really I'm gonna
58:54 - have to do a lot more work to practice
58:56 - this and figure this out
58:57 - wake up save this document activate
59:04 - Chrome go to sleep so I'm gonna look for
59:10 - f5 is refresh right so there's got to be
59:14 - under commands there's got to be a
59:22 - command for for f5 what's auto text oh
59:31 - that's probably like an ADD wake up wake
59:35 - up dictation global key commands press
59:40 - the shift are ah so I could do press the
59:43 - key shift are press the key command are
59:47 - press the key f5 would probably work
59:50 - right so that's what I need if I need to
59:54 - add a function key command so obviously
59:57 - I could just hit it with my finger but
59:58 - let's try
60:03 - wake up press the key command R press
60:14 - the key command R there we go so this is
60:22 - my current range of motion I suppose but
60:28 - that's about the only
60:34 - oh well boy this was a reality check for
60:40 - me about how little I can do with just
60:43 - dictation and p5 but this was a good
60:46 - experiment for me to see and learn all
60:49 - of the stuff that's missing so as I have
60:52 - time over the next couple weeks I'm
60:54 - actually one thing I should mention I've
60:55 - been doing a lot of reading and learning
60:56 - so I've got a lot of es6 stuff down that
60:59 - i'm really excited to come back in the
61:00 - fall and teach a bunch of JavaScript
61:01 - concepts that are part of es6 in
61:03 - particular the new syntax and class
61:07 - classes based syntax we're doing
61:08 - object-oriented programming I'm going to
61:10 - add that to my courses here at NYU and
61:11 - make a whole bunch of video tutorials
61:13 - about that use a headset so oh my
61:18 - goodness I didn't go to sleep go to
61:20 - sleep go to sleep okay
61:26 - so that's one thing that's been
61:29 - interesting for me but what I'm going to
61:31 - look into doing is seeing if I can
61:33 - customize more of the features and to be
61:37 - able to programming atom and switch back
61:39 - and forth if anyone wants to help me
61:41 - with this project I'm trying to remember
61:43 - the name of the open source repository
61:44 - that Tavis Rudd mentioned in the video I
61:48 - don't know if anybody knows it's like
61:50 - dragon speaks please just let me do
61:56 - github dragonfly this is it so this is a
62:07 - speech recognition framework allowing
62:09 - powerful python-based scripting and
62:11 - extension of Dragon NaturallySpeaking
62:13 - so in theory I haven't looked into this
62:15 - at all but in theory you can create your
62:20 - own grammars and examples and different
62:22 - things anyone is interested on and I
62:24 - know that Tavis Rudd is on Twitter and
62:26 - in that YouTube video has published a
62:28 - lot of code again everything's
62:29 - programmed in Python using vim and Emacs
62:32 - and I probably should go down that road
62:34 - I think you probably very smartly made
62:37 - those decisions to be able to work very
62:38 - effectively but for me you know I'm
62:41 - curious what can i push can I do web
62:44 - development JavaScript or processing
62:46 - through dictation
62:47 - I don't mind customizing and writing
62:48 - code to customize what I'm doing in
62:51 - Python but I would like the examples to
62:53 - be the same sort of stuff that I'm doing
62:54 - so if anybody was interested in helping
62:56 - with this please feel free to get in
62:59 - touch on Twitter at Schiffman or maybe I
63:02 - can create a github repository but uh
63:04 - it's very hard for me to actually do the
63:06 - development work to figure out this
63:08 - stuff out given that I can barely can I
63:09 - can't really type at the moment so um
63:11 - thanks for everyone for tuning in I
63:18 - wonder if I want to take it's 2:35 I'm a
63:22 - little bit late to an appointment that I
63:23 - have to go to oh I meant to uh I should
63:26 - have a guest video tutorial coming in
63:29 - the next couple weeks I hope so that'll
63:31 - be some content that will appear on the
63:32 - channel and perhaps in August I will be
63:35 - a bit more back into the swing of things
63:37 - and I'm very excited to talk to you
63:43 - about I'm curious to what I'm getting a
63:57 - marker over here I'm curious
64:02 - can i I'm going to talk to you about
64:05 - this with my left hand Const let thank
64:13 - you to ADA who is a supporter and viewer
64:18 - of the coding train who wrote a really
64:20 - nice blog post I will try to include it
64:23 - in the description for this video maybe
64:25 - someone can post it in the chat about
64:27 - the difference between Const let and VAR
64:29 - I think she I think that's where I I
64:34 - also watched a nice video from a fun fun
64:36 - function but ADA is working on a series
64:38 - of blog posts about es6 that have been
64:40 - very helpful to me and i watched a nice
64:42 - video from fun fun function also about
64:44 - const let and VAR so i hope to be
64:49 - covering this I'm just sort of curious
64:52 - how this goes that's actually not so bad
64:55 - we're using my left hand come to think
64:57 - of it and
64:59 - also I want to talk a lot this fall
65:05 - about the class keyword in es6 all right
65:18 - well you guys are all very kind to be
65:21 - tuning in I was going to do this I was
65:23 - thinking ah maybe I'll just do a
65:24 - experiment with this code dictation and
65:26 - old stuff just for the patreon
65:28 - subscribers I'm making a private stream
65:30 - and then I thought well why not I'll
65:32 - turn on the I'm here I might as well
65:34 - turn on the system see how it goes I'm
65:36 - gonna take five minutes to see if
65:37 - there's any questions I can answer
65:38 - if you are a patreon backer you can ask
65:41 - the question in the slack JavaScript
65:44 - voice recognition for JavaScript writes
65:47 - Simon I wonder if that is something that
65:50 - exists so maybe I should google that and
65:51 - take a look into that okay yeah yes 6
65:59 - equals JavaScript 2015 I'm Way behind
66:02 - you know I'm never not really a
66:04 - cutting-edge kind of person I'm just you
66:07 - know doing my best here keep up with
66:09 - things yeah cuz there's a new there's
66:12 - already gonna be another version of
66:14 - JavaScript I was trying to wait till
66:15 - yeah 6 was born I don't know what I was
66:17 - trying to do but you know I think it's
66:19 - time it's time for me to use some stuff
66:22 - from es6
66:22 - I don't want to use the you know at some
66:25 - point I would like to cover some of the
66:26 - more esoteric complex syntax but mostly
66:28 - I just want to use the stuff that makes
66:30 - things a little clearer and more elegant
66:31 - I'm that sort of thing the guest is not
66:37 - happy cat although I would love to have
66:40 - happy cat as a guest or do a
66:41 - collaboration with happy cat she has a
66:43 - wonderful YouTube channel that I would
66:44 - suggest you check out well you make a
66:47 - video of both neural networks in genetic
66:49 - evolution in one video yeah so
66:50 - unfortunately that was the path I was on
66:52 - so I got I would say maybe I got a tenth
66:55 - of the way through the neural network
66:57 - stuff I was gonna do a lot more I think
67:00 - I made two or three videos and then once
67:03 - I got through that I also was gonna look
67:05 - at genetic algorithms and involving
67:06 - neural network weights I do have some
67:08 - examples they're actually broken and I
67:10 - think I have a pull request that fit
67:12 - one of the examples I just haven't had a
67:13 - chance to look at it yet it's hard for
67:15 - me to sort of evaluate and run code but
67:18 - that's where I'm altom utley hoping to
67:21 - go so I will get to that it's just going
67:24 - to come later can you make a tutorial
67:26 - video about using HTML CSS and J's to
67:29 - make a website I would take a look at my
67:36 - HTML CSS playlist it's part of the
67:38 - foundations of JavaScript it's not
67:40 - taught in a kind of proper web
67:42 - development way but all the concepts are
67:44 - there for and I cover how to do creative
67:46 - coding with HTML CSS and JavaScript
67:48 - using p5 so that's something you could
67:50 - you could take a look at it that exists
67:51 - already okay could you do some Python I
67:57 - was also planning on doing some Python
67:58 - yes and actually I'm still looking for a
68:02 - really good Python book to read on my
68:05 - Kindle it's hard for me to read books
68:08 - that I have to hold and turn the pages
68:10 - of the Kindle is really easy and I don't
68:12 - like reading on an iPad or the computer
68:13 - so much so I'm any recommendations and
68:16 - maybe I'll come back and do a book
68:17 - review after I get through it I I've
68:19 - been reading about es6 and I'm also
68:20 - thinking of learning react but again I
68:23 - said this last time I think that might
68:25 - be much too useful for me in practical
68:27 - somebody might actually like learn
68:28 - something you get a job from my videos
68:30 - which is you know you shouldn't watch my
68:32 - videos to learn anything practical or
68:33 - useful so but I'm considering learning
68:36 - react especially because there's a new
68:38 - Alpha p5 GS web editor that is coming
68:41 - soon and it is built with react and I
68:43 - would like to be able to contribute to
68:45 - that and help with that open source
68:46 - project so it is something I should
68:47 - learn Cody
68:48 - Tetris Cody challenge I really love to
68:50 - do that now because I really got this
68:51 - dictation thing down I think I could
68:52 - tackle something like that with
68:53 - dictation I had a lot of tutorials
68:56 - already about text processing as a Jason
68:59 - Matthew asks go and check out it used to
69:02 - be called programming from A to Z I
69:04 - can't remember where we are at this
69:05 - point but I think well I'm Jacob use
69:10 - programming from A to Z sounds like it's
69:11 - a beginner course in programming but my
69:13 - video my course and playlist is actually
69:15 - for adventure
69:17 - people with their I do have beginner
69:19 - playlist but that program from A to Z
69:21 - playlist is not at all beginner so I
69:22 - think I'm going to change it to just
69:23 - something like programming with text
69:25 - which with matches suggestion I don't
69:27 - remember if that's been done already but
69:28 - go through look for that playlist it's
69:30 - all about working with text speaking of
69:33 - books any must read book about Java I
69:36 - don't know about must read I honestly I
69:39 - think there's a big classic what's the
69:42 - big classic Java textbook that everybody
69:45 - uses I think I used that probably over
69:47 - ten years ago you know I don't want you
69:49 - know this is the worst thing I could
69:51 - possibly do which is like to plug my own
69:52 - book but it's not to learn Java per se
69:55 - but if you want to learn from the
69:57 - beginning programming and want Java
69:59 - syntax if you look at the learning
70:01 - processing book that's exactly what I do
70:03 - in that book and using the processing
70:05 - development environment and after that
70:06 - you can kind of graduate to using
70:07 - eclipse and other Java syntax as well
70:10 - but just for learning Java itself
70:12 - there's a kind of well big Java is it
70:14 - called something like that I feel like
70:16 - is a textbook that I used a long time
70:18 - ago I don't recommend it but it's pretty
70:19 - comprehensive okay
70:25 - the Douglas Crockford book is a very
70:27 - interesting book and that's for
70:28 - JavaScript it's called the good parts
70:30 - it's not for learning Java a book that I
70:33 - absolutely love for learning JavaScript
70:35 - is eloquent JavaScript whoops
70:41 - eloquent JavaScript let's go to the this
70:49 - is a book that I used to learn Java
70:53 - scripts myself I don't know if it's
70:55 - using es6 syntax one wonderful things
70:57 - about it it's all available for free
70:58 - online which I try to do now with
71:01 - anything that I'm putting online so I
71:03 - appreciate that for sure and of course
71:04 - you can buy a copy to also support the
71:06 - author which I would encourage you to do
71:08 - if you like the book and also the
71:11 - getting started with p5.js is a nice
71:14 - book to learn the basics of JavaScript
71:15 - to the cop in the context of p5 just so
71:18 - much yeah and the slack of the patreon
71:20 - group in the slack channel writes
71:21 - program with text has already been done
71:23 - so if you're looking for all my
71:24 - tutorials about Markov chains and text
71:26 - analysis and word counting you can look
71:29 - for the programming with text it's also
71:31 - at Schiffman neck / e 2zii okay so unity
71:37 - would be great
71:37 - that's another
71:38 - that I should learn so I I'm trying to
71:41 - soak in knowledge and watch videos and
71:42 - read books while I'm not doing as much
71:45 - typing and I'm healing so to speak so
71:48 - unity Mike my major things are es6 react
71:52 - Python and now unity those would be
71:54 - things I would love to sort of pick up
71:55 - some skills with okay so thanks
71:57 - everybody it's 2:45 p.m. again you're
72:02 - welcome to join my patreon if you like
72:04 - it's going to be paused for the month of
72:05 - July so it won't be it won't be
72:09 - activated again until September 1st the
72:10 - August 1st will be paused if I set up
72:13 - the settings correctly I would encourage
72:15 - you to support in the meantime while I'm
72:16 - kind of on hiatus the processing
72:18 - foundation processing foundation org and
72:20 - of course there's also I'm just like
72:22 - plugging stuff now nature of code comm
72:24 - if you're interested supporting the
72:26 - nature of code book and other stuff that
72:28 - I'm doing you can you can do that as
72:30 - well I didn't see I'm glad in a way that
72:33 - I didn't see any super chat messages but
72:35 - I just want to make sure I didn't miss
72:36 - any so if somebody did do a super chat
72:38 - message please send me a tweet or an
72:41 - email I should hear something I want to
72:43 - mention I noticed something the chat
72:45 - said why don't you reply to your emails
72:46 - I pretty slow about replying to emails I
72:49 - do get a lot of just programming
72:50 - question emails and it's unrealistic I
72:52 - think for me too you know I could spend
72:54 - all day answering them and it's not that
72:55 - much but so typically if you have
72:58 - programming questions ask them at forum
72:59 - processing org but I do read all the
73:01 - emails and I do try to reply to them all
73:03 - eventually and I also try to reply to
73:06 - all the YouTube comments but I haven't
73:08 - been able to do that but know that if
73:10 - you're writing YouTube comments I am
73:12 - reading them all so I am reading all the
73:14 - comments
73:14 - I'm just not replying and you could
73:17 - always also tweet me at Schiffman on
73:20 - twitter
73:21 - okay raspberry pi would also be a great
73:23 - thing to learn okay thanks everybody for
73:27 - tuning in today to this extra live
73:31 - stream I may be back the first week of
73:34 - August if things are going well in terms
73:37 - of healing and dictation I'll try to
73:40 - think of some content I could do but I
73:43 - don't know when I'll be back in the full
73:45 - swing of things it could be a while so
73:48 - I'm sorry for that sort of yeah it's
73:51 - good
73:52 - I'm learning lots of new things about
73:53 - life by having this injury and I'll see
74:00 - you guys another time I don't know if
74:05 - this counts as an official livestream
74:07 - I'm a little worried about I was close
74:08 - to getting to livestream number 100 and
74:10 - I felt that I want to do something
74:12 - special for that I don't know if this
74:13 - counts maybe it does okay I'm going to
74:15 - turn this off the good news for you is
74:16 - this is very hard for me to figure out
74:17 - how to turn this off because I need to
74:19 - click a button over here which we really
74:21 - need to operate this other mouse okay it
74:23 - wasn't so hard I'm already doing it and
74:27 - I just want to also say thank you ever I
74:30 - got lots of really nice messages of
74:31 - support emails and tweets and things in
74:34 - the mail even so I really appreciate it
74:37 - it's really lovely things are fine
74:40 - doing well Healing having physical
74:43 - therapy should be back to things soon
74:45 - enough I will definitely keep everybody
74:47 - posted and I look forward to seeing you
74:49 - in the future on the channel if you have
74:51 - ideas for things that I could do or
74:53 - things that I can be helpful with please

75:01 - I hope you enjoyed that completely
75:04 - insane totally messed up dictation
75:07 - attempt I really excited the name to get
75:09 - good at it and have a weird is sort of
75:10 - like strange performance art okay we
75:14 - can't run off I really have to turn this
75:15 - off now okay goodbye and see you in the
75:20 - future
75:20 - oh I do see the super chat so that does

76:52 - different reasons but it was interesting
76:53 - to see it work for just this livestream
76:55 - since I fought I figured oh I pausing my
76:57 - patreon maybe I'll just put this up just
76:59 - as sort of like see but anyway okay good
77:01 - bye hi
