00:03 - means it's time for January January is
00:06 - an artificially generated month of time
00:08 - where we build code that makes beautiful
00:10 - things every day there is a prompt I
00:13 - heard that holding the microphone would

00:16 - seem to be working it's not plugged in

00:47 - analyze its pixels find the colors and
00:50 - the right spots from which to send
00:52 - particles out into the world I don't
00:54 - know here it is what do you
