01:57 - I forgot to do a sound check before I
02:09 - started streaming so I assume you all
02:12 - can hear me
02:13 - test one two I hear myself in the
02:16 - monitor
02:17 - let me know in the chat if that sounds
02:19 - good

06:07 - hello and good morning and welcome to
06:14 - the coding train two days in a row if
06:17 - you complete that which is kind of an
06:19 - odd thing considering the hats this is
06:23 - kind of the busiest time of the year for
06:25 - me but I missed a week there's a lot of
06:28 - stuff that I would like to get done
06:29 - before the end of the year one of these
06:31 - days maybe I can do a kind of year in
06:33 - review or some kind of Happy New Year
06:37 - show but not this year because there's
06:42 - not many days left in December so I have
06:48 - a very specific thing that I want to do
06:49 - today and unlike yesterday where I don't
06:52 - think I got started with the actual
06:53 - coding tutorial portion for well over an
06:55 - hour I think it might actually even put
06:57 - an hour and a half my intention is to
06:59 - get started with that within the first
07:00 - ten minutes ideally but let me just make
07:03 - a couple quick announcements which are
07:07 - similar things that I that to what I
07:10 - mentioned yesterday
07:12 - one is the ITP show if you are local to
07:18 - the New York City area I highly
07:21 - recommend you come visit the new ITP ima
07:25 - location here in Brooklyn 370 J Street
07:28 - downtown Brooklyn this Sunday December
07:30 - 15th and Monday December 16th I will be
07:33 - doing a live stream from the show most
07:37 - likely Monday I'm pretty certain about
07:40 - this now actually I've scheduled it for
07:42 - Monday
07:42 - December 16th at 3:00 p.m. Eastern is
07:45 - when I'm hoping to get started so take a
07:49 - look at that and if you're in the New
07:51 - York area come say hello
07:52 - I'll have my stickers with me hopefully
07:55 - I got to order some new stickers and I
07:57 - actually been giving a lot away and they
07:58 - don't have very many left so that's
08:02 - important note number one important note
08:05 - number two is just to remind you about
08:09 - mmm I guess I'll go to twitter.com
08:13 - processing org the well the processing
08:17 - fellowship applications are due December
08:20 - 19th which is just a mere five or so
08:25 - days from now because today's ooh today
08:28 - is oh it's for an excuse for this ID 213
08:36 - boutique late
08:39 - [Music]
08:42 - so I have a story to tell actually I'll
08:44 - play this music Rebecca when I was just
08:47 - a wee lad be around 10 years old oh this
08:52 - is this is terrible I got a music it's
08:56 - really freaking me out it was Friday the
08:58 - 13th I was walking home from school and
09:01 - a Black Cat crossed my path maybe I've
09:07 - been telling but I actually this is not
09:09 - a funny of a story I had I had an injury
09:12 - that day where I was playing underneath
09:14 - the porch of my house I don't know why I
09:17 - was under there where I grew up in
09:18 - Baltimore Maryland go Oh's next year is
09:22 - gonna be the year and I bashed my head I
09:27 - stood up and bashed my head and got like
09:28 - a big cut there and I had to go get
09:30 - stitches and they had like like shave a
09:32 - little portion so I think you know you
09:34 - can see that I'm kind of going bald up
09:36 - here I know I look just so youthful like
09:40 - I just graduated from high school just
09:42 - last week now but but when I go fully
09:50 - bald which I assume will happen at some
09:51 - point there should be a scar up there
09:53 - I've never actually seen it but well
09:54 - we'll take a look I've got a nice scar
09:56 - under here also I've got a very large
09:58 - scar here I don't know if you can see
10:00 - and a lot of metal in my arm but that
10:06 - that okay what was I talking about
10:11 - ah and then also nice segue here thank
10:15 - you - today is a sponsor of the Kodi
10:18 - train brilliant dot-org it's a holiday
10:23 - mystic
10:25 - so thank you to brilliant org I will
10:27 - come back and talk a little more about
10:29 - brilliant and look at one of their daily
10:32 - challenges I was actually looking at it
10:34 - on the subway this morning it's one of
10:36 - the things I like to do to exercise my
10:39 - brain I really need to do some physical
10:41 - exercise as well but if you want to
10:44 - learn more about brilliant or go to
10:47 - ProLiant dot org slash coding train and
10:50 - if you're interested in a premium
10:52 - subscription which will unlock all the
10:53 - features you will get a discount by
10:55 - going through that link okay I think
10:58 - that's everything with all of my
11:01 - announcements so I could just get
11:03 - started
11:04 - oh no no no fellowships fundraiser
11:06 - fundraiser all right then I sort of
11:08 - talked about Friday the 13th fundraiser
11:12 - so please if you can consider supporting
11:16 - p5 this giving season
11:18 - I talked quite extensively about the
11:20 - processing fundraiser and our goals for
11:25 - 2020 to be able to sustain these open
11:28 - source projects and the community behind
11:29 - them I won't talk through all of those
11:32 - details again today I will just point
11:33 - you to this page you can see we have a
11:35 - quite an ambitious goal of reaching
11:39 - fundraising $150,000
11:42 - some of that a large portion that will
11:45 - be applied to leadership and stewardship
11:49 - of the p5.js libraries so you know I
11:51 - benefit enormous Lea from these open
11:54 - source free open source tools I use them
11:56 - to make tutorials I've written books
11:58 - that use them I teach with them so a lot
12:01 - of the things that I have in my life are
12:02 - because of the volunteer hours and a
12:06 - paid work that people have put in and
12:08 - the more that we can fund and pay people
12:10 - to do this work that's a really
12:12 - important thing for an inclusive open
12:15 - source project so consider that and you
12:18 - know you could be the proud owner of
12:21 - these fruit of what you really should
12:22 - want are these beautiful artworks
12:23 - artworks by these wonderful artists but
12:26 - psy coding trained community manager
12:28 - they have designed a coding train zine
12:32 - which features a whole bunch of recent
12:34 - challenges with images and source code
12:36 - and if you want one of these I will sign
12:39 - it I don't know if that means anything
12:41 - I don't know why it should but I will
12:43 - and you can get one thank you very much
12:49 - all right now I'm gonna close out these
12:54 - windows and where am I saying no here
12:58 - okay now what am I going to do today
13:05 - what am I going to do today just look at
13:16 - what like weird music did I put onto
13:19 - this sound board Oh fry this is Good
13:24 - Friday 13th all right
13:28 - and a little random number ASMR to warm
13:36 - up my voice I'm still kind of getting
13:37 - over this cool
13:38 - [Music]
13:43 - twenty-five thousand three hundred
13:45 - thirty two twenty six thousand seven
13:49 - hundred eighty thirty four thousand
13:53 - three hundred seventy-one
13:56 - 8050 for
14:00 - six thousand five hundred and seventy
14:02 - one seventy three thousand four hundred
14:06 - and seventy eight
14:08 - [Music]
14:11 - sixteen thousand two hundred and eighty
14:13 - four
14:17 - 2587
14:23 - we eat of the comments dan says
14:26 - technically our table is given two
14:28 - random numbers
14:30 - seventy-three thousand four hundred and
14:31 - seventy eight twenty six thousand seven
14:34 - hundred eighty this is a log thought
14:39 - okay let's move on
14:45 - all right um so yesterday on yesterday's
14:50 - live stream
14:51 - I created this example it's something
14:52 - very exciting is about to happen
14:54 - number one is I'm just turned on my
14:56 - webcam and I've got my computer facing
14:58 - me you can see it here
14:59 - there's my webcam oh but you don't see
15:02 - me why because I have an external webcam
15:07 - today so if I come over here I can walk
15:14 - over here look at that it's very glarey
15:16 - I can even I guess I can switch this
15:19 - here but that you don't see oh I should
15:21 - create it oh I could create a layout
15:23 - where I show both oh interesting let me
15:27 - try something
15:28 - bear with me for a second just curious
15:34 - I'm gonna create a new I'm gonna I'm
15:36 - gonna I'm gonna put on this waiting
15:40 - music I'm gonna switch this I have
15:45 - I'm gonna create a new scene scene dual
15:51 - split we call this a split screen and
15:56 - I'm gonna add you can't see what I'm
15:59 - doing here but you'll see soon enough
16:02 - video capture video capture device
16:07 - [Music]
16:15 - [Music]
16:26 - whiteboard then now if I stand over here
16:34 - this side of the way oh this is perfect
16:37 - then what I'm gonna do how do you crop
16:41 - oh [ __ ] anybody know that's squishing
16:55 - [Music]
17:02 - [Music]
17:05 - copy transform rotate flip fit to screen
17:09 - stretch the screen Center to screen
17:11 - ruff how do i crop how to crop open
17:20 - broadcast studio click the source you
17:24 - want to crop hold down the Alt key and
17:26 - drag the bounding box alt
17:32 - oh I'm cropping the wrong one right this
18:04 - is gonna be so fancy you guys are gonna
18:05 - be amazed
18:09 - [Music]
18:22 - the music is gone hold on let me add the
18:26 - music music is there now all right I
18:51 - could talk to you here and it's doing my
18:54 - post at here awesome look at me I am
18:56 - such a fancy streamer now I can even add
19:02 - a button to my stream deck these are the
19:06 - kind of things that a normal person
19:07 - would do before they start live strictly
19:16 - we're gonna split screen and we're gonna
19:20 - call it split
19:22 - [Music]
19:36 - so when I come over here to use
19:39 - demonstrate why is the weird focus
19:43 - alright thanks for bearing with me so I
19:50 - think this is gonna be important today
19:51 - because what I'm going to attempt to do
19:55 - is classify poses by training a neural
19:59 - network to recognize what pose I'm
20:01 - making so let me clean this example up a
20:04 - little bit because I don't think I could
20:09 - I don't really need the skeleton I'll
20:11 - leave that in there because visually
20:12 - it's kind of nice I don't need to draw
20:16 - this stuff I just want to draw all the
20:19 - key points and the skeleton let's make
20:27 - the key points also try this let's draw
20:34 - the key points after I think this will I
20:40 - guess if I make it the same color
20:41 - doesn't really matter just want to get
20:44 - something very visually simple that will
20:49 - do I wonder if I should use a different
20:53 - color but I think it's fine what if I
20:58 - did
21:08 - this yr weird phone okay I don't know
21:15 - somebody booze a designer - should I
21:18 - keep the lines in here it's so weird how
21:20 - they appear and disappear could I get a
21:23 - maybe I want to put this webcam further
21:26 - away also where could I put it it's
21:37 - showing the table now that's no good
21:40 - all right I'm gonna it's gonna be fine I
21:42 - would love to get like a full body shot
21:45 - but this will have to do how far back
21:49 - can I put it without showing the table
21:53 - further well I see the table so up a
22:02 - little bit there we go
22:05 - that will just have to do a little bit
22:14 - that'll do okay Oh Here I am alright
22:25 - what's what's the happ's people's I
22:29 - forgot what I was doing my glasses were
22:31 - very dirty
22:32 - please let me clean them and then I will
22:38 - talk about what I'm going to do all
22:40 - right
22:41 - I have a fan the fan on this computer is
22:47 - going crazy can you hear that you hear
22:52 - that so I want our novice asking that
23:01 - task is classification and but I want to
23:07 - do classification and regression and
23:09 - this is ten twenty someone's giving me a
23:12 - suggestion in the chat here okay
23:18 - [Music]
23:28 - and we will begin
23:52 - come on focus camera ooh
24:00 - all right let's try this this is gonna
24:04 - be interesting
24:09 - I really should mirror myself but I'm
24:14 - just not gonna worry about that hmm let
24:20 - me add the flip image thing so let's do
24:23 - let me also add to this let me do
24:39 - something here I am going to show you
24:44 - how to flip the video I am going to say
24:50 - a scale negative 1 1 and then draw the
24:56 - image reversed which means 0 video dot
25:01 - with comma 0 is that correct
25:09 - No
25:11 - I've done this so many times an answer
25:14 - to this question so many times for
25:17 - people and yet I can never get it when I
25:20 - need to do it myself
25:21 - so what I'm trying to do is let's let's
25:25 - take a look here is the idea is that if
25:30 - this is my canvas
25:37 - and I drew and I call scale negative one
25:43 - comma one that is flipping the
25:46 - horizontal axis so that positive pixels
25:49 - go that way oh shoot
25:51 - ah I guess this is camera is in a
25:56 - different position than it was before
25:59 - again if I if this is my canvas and I
26:13 - call scale negative one comma one then
26:19 - that means the x-axis has a positive
26:23 - pixels in this direction zero zero is
26:28 - still here so what I think that I could
26:32 - do what I thought I could do is just
26:34 - draw the image with the X location here
26:38 - and then it'll sort of unfold backwards
26:41 - but in Reverse so I don't want to use
26:47 - ml5 flip image because I don't want to
26:54 - use ml5 flip image because though I
27:00 - think that's gonna cause an issue
27:03 - because the the points will still come
27:06 - back
27:11 - unforgettable
27:14 - adding though the because I also want to
27:19 - flip the where the points are being
27:20 - drawn so what am I doing here
27:29 - so let's look on let's look at I'll show
27:35 - you where this is done
27:39 - source utils
27:55 - oh that interesting just translating I
27:58 - wonder if the width and height is
27:59 - different all right so this is here it
28:02 - is it's just just doing this so then I
28:08 - can go back to here and say translates
28:13 - negative with commas zero I'm sorry
28:19 - video with commas here oh this should do
28:21 - it
28:21 - oh but then this goes at zero zero
28:51 - I'm doing it exactly the same way
28:53 - translate scale
29:15 - oh oh oh I need to translate first of
29:21 - course there we go okay
29:29 - so now this is the reason why I wanted
29:31 - to do this cuz I just don't want to have
29:33 - to it's just gonna add a whole layer of
29:34 - extra complications to flip I can just
29:37 - slip the whole scene right there which
29:38 - is the easiest way of doing this okay so
29:42 - that is good
29:51 - so now I can go back to split
30:04 - okay
30:09 - focus focus focus there we go and now
30:22 - just funny to put things in front of the
30:25 - camera no I can't okay well sorry I'm
30:39 - just entertaining myself here waiting
30:42 - for people to show up welcome to part
30:49 - one let's see what am I saying
30:59 - oh hello welcome to another video using
31:04 - MLS remember I said I wasn't gonna do
31:11 - all sorts of ridiculous starting and
31:13 - stopping did I ever say that I am saying
31:16 - that hello and welcome to another video
31:20 - using pose net and ml 5gs but in this
31:24 - video what I'm going to do is take the
31:27 - output of the pose net pre-trained model
31:30 - and feed that into an ml 5 neural
31:33 - network to train a pose classifier to
31:36 - recognize when I'm making certain
31:38 - motions like a Y and M a C and a alright
31:44 - so I talked about this at the end of the
31:45 - last video where I covered how to make
31:48 - this particular I talked about this at
31:58 - the
32:07 - alright so the two videos the two videos
32:13 - that I'm assuming our prerequisites here
32:15 - are the previous one where I covered all
32:17 - of the code for this particular pose in
32:19 - that example that you're seeing running
32:20 - right here in the web editor as well as
32:22 - this train your own neural network set
32:25 - of videos that covered the basics about
32:27 - how the ml5 neural network class works
32:31 - that covered the basics for how the ml5
32:34 - neural network function works
32:59 - that covered the basics of how the ml5
33:02 - neural network function works to train a
33:04 - model to play musical notes based on
33:07 - where the user clicks their mouse in a
33:09 - canvas
33:20 - well this is not running sweet it's
33:25 - running
33:32 - okay all right
33:41 - so to get started I could really begin
33:43 - with either one of these sketches like I
33:45 - could bring pose net into this one or I
33:47 - could bring the neural network stuff
33:49 - where I'm looking to get started I could
33:55 - really begin with either one of these
33:56 - sketches for example I could go and get
33:58 - my pose netcode and bring it into this
34:00 - particular sketch or I could take the
34:02 - neural network code from this sketch and
34:04 - bring it into the pose net1 I think I
34:06 - want to continue working from the pose
34:08 - in that sketch itself
34:17 - and the first thing that I want to do is
34:20 - create an object to store the neural
34:22 - network so I'm going to call that brain
34:24 - and then after I initialize the pose net
34:28 - model I'll say brain is a new ml5 neural
34:31 - network and you might recall that any
34:38 - time you create a neural network sorry
34:42 - and you might recall that any time you
34:44 - create a neural network you can specify
34:47 - a set of options for how you configure
34:49 - that neural network
35:17 - okay
35:35 - nathan is asking is there a way to
35:37 - disable the webcam autofocus I have no
35:40 - idea someone can look this up for me it
35:42 - is a logitech HD 1080p web camera and if
35:49 - there's a way to do that I would gladly
35:50 - do so but I don't think so
36:15 - the full range of all the options you
36:17 - can specify when creating a neural
36:19 - network can be found in the
36:20 - documentation but I'm going to begin
36:22 - with just these four options how many
36:26 - inputs
36:26 - how many outputs what's the task and do
36:29 - I want to debug do I want
36:42 - let's get rid of the debug thing I'll
36:44 - bring that back in later the full range
36:48 - of all the options you can specify would
36:49 - create in the neural network it can be
36:51 - found in ml v website documentation but
36:53 - I'm gonna just begin with just three
36:55 - things I just want to do the basics how
36:57 - many inputs
36:57 - how many outputs and what is the task
37:18 - I want to mention the canvas thing where
37:25 - should I have done that probably should
37:27 - have mentioned that right from the
37:28 - beginning I'll come back to that I just
37:34 - kind of have the diagram
37:35 - I'll just diagram it again okay
37:51 - maybe we could just maybe I'll just do
37:53 - this out of order and Matt chick and
37:55 - figure out when it should go in
38:34 - how do I emphasize
38:42 - okay one thing I want to briefly mention
38:47 - before I begin the actual project here
38:49 - is they added something to the code
38:51 - where I mirrored the image so the image
38:53 - it's a little hard for you to see but is
38:55 - mirrored you can see this is my left
38:56 - hand but it appears to be my right hand
38:59 - in the actual image on my left it's
39:02 - mirrored this is a very important thing
39:04 - for interactivity because you want to
39:06 - see oh wait I should never leave so wait
39:17 - for it to like pick me up again right
39:20 - what explain what
39:22 - before I begin coding let me quickly
39:25 - mention something I added between the
39:26 - last video and now I'm mirroring the
39:28 - image so that when I let raise my left
39:31 - hand it's mirrored to me what I'm seeing
39:33 - on the screen in front of me over there
39:35 - and this is important for interactivity
39:37 - it makes it feel much more intuitive and
39:39 - natural to see yourself mirrored you
39:41 - might recall that that ml5 has a
39:43 - specific function called flip image that
39:46 - will do it for you but I actually found
39:47 - because I'm drawing all this other stuff
39:49 - that it's easier for me to just write
39:50 - the code for that itself which involves
39:52 - a translate and a scale in other words
39:58 - typically when I draw an image I'm
40:01 - drawing it from 0 0 and and right in
40:11 - other words typically if I'm drawing an
40:12 - image at 0 0 I'm drawing it right here
40:15 - and the image gets painted across the
40:18 - canvas but if I call scale negative 1
40:21 - comma 1 it sets the x-axis going in the
40:24 - other direction so positive pixels go
40:26 - this way and if I translate over to here
40:28 - and put 0 0 here and draw the image this
40:31 - way it will appear reverse inverted
40:34 - flipped to the viewer okay
40:43 - so that's what's happening in these
40:45 - three steps right here right now so
40:53 - Matt's yeah I think that'll probably go
40:55 - earlier and then or something we'll
40:58 - figure it out so now let me oh boy
41:01 - you couldn't see me writing any of this
41:03 - stuff ah it's fine
41:07 - who did that
41:16 - did that's a good idea clip iasts doing
41:19 - a good idea is suggesting a good idea of
41:21 - putting something on the wall so it will
41:22 - focus it let me try that in a second
41:24 - just did the fact that I you can't see
41:26 - that I drew 0-0 up here is that gonna be
41:29 - like a huge problem
41:30 - do I need to redo that I mean I had a
41:38 - minimum I could do this right now like
41:43 - that was fine right so I need to redo
41:45 - that explanation maybe I want to redo
41:52 - that excavation drawing the diagram
41:53 - anyway
42:19 - don't redo it okay let's see here if I
42:24 - can oh there's the eraser let's see if I
42:31 - could do that suggestion of putting
42:34 - something on the wall too bad the wall
42:44 - it's not magnetic so I would just do
42:47 - this it's not magnetic do I have any
42:50 - tape in here be nice if I had just like
42:53 - some gaffers tape I think this is an
42:58 - excellent idea that's worth pursuing all
43:03 - sorts of stuff nothing to tape anything
43:09 - to the wall I am a smart surface no tape
43:22 - in this room I know where I can find
43:25 - tape but I'd have to leave here that
43:30 - seems like a sad thing I guess I could
43:32 - maybe I'll go get a piece of tape can
43:35 - you all tolerate that I'm so here we go
43:40 - I'm gonna put this on I will be back in
43:43 - just a couple minutes I'm gonna get some
43:45 - tape
43:47 - [Music]
43:55 - [Music]
44:13 - [Music]
44:19 - [Music]
44:47 - I am back tape let's see if it works
45:36 - with just
45:44 - where's that on-air sign ah seriously
46:06 - [Music]
46:15 - [Music]
46:27 - look put a plant in the corner of the
46:30 - room I love that idea I don't have a
46:33 - plant get up I think I know where a
46:37 - plant is love the idea of having a plan
46:44 - [Music]
46:52 - [Music]
47:05 - cher is getting ridiculous
47:15 - [Music]
47:20 - print my face
47:26 - okay I think I should just move on and
47:29 - let it autofocus
47:30 - [Music]
47:52 - was it was it because the sign was under
47:55 - the camera I doubt it oh hey look at
48:02 - that
48:06 - tada
48:08 - I think the sign under the camera was
48:10 - messing it up oh no I just got lucky
48:15 - a printed face I could print a face
48:22 - that's gonna take a little while I have
48:26 - like prints up pig's head to the printer
48:28 - go get it that seems ridiculous I think
48:37 - maybe I'll just move on and let it focus
48:39 - on me it's not that big of a deal okay
48:49 - so here I go here I come to save the day
48:56 - so warm in here
49:11 - remember me
49:25 - the full set of options for the full set
49:29 - of option for configuring an ml5 neural
49:31 - network you could find by reading the
49:35 - chat Oh interesting the problem is the
49:39 - camera trying to focus on me oh yeah
49:42 - hold on hold on I believe you
49:44 - not that I just have to test this theory
49:46 - okay
49:48 - it's focused on me people help me let
50:10 - this go you know I have a problem with
50:13 - this kind of thing and I'll spend like
50:14 - hours wasting time on this I don't think
50:16 - it's a good use of anybody's time
50:33 - you can find out more about what kinds
50:36 - of options you can use to configure an
50:38 - ml5 neural network but I'm just going to
50:40 - start with the basics
51:06 - all of these guys make you be crazy cuz
51:11 - I'm looking this way I'm seeing it a
51:13 - chat move on people let's move on let's
51:16 - move on let's move on all the options
51:20 - for how to configure an ml 5 neural
51:21 - network are on the documentation page on
51:23 - the reference but I'm just gonna work
51:25 - with these ah all of the up all the
51:35 - options for how to configure at ml 5
51:37 - neural network you could find on the
51:38 - documentation page on the reference but
51:40 - I'm just gonna work with these 4 basic
51:42 - ones inputs output what tasks is it and
51:44 - whether I want to debug the training
51:46 - process or not so let's diagram out
51:49 - what's going on to know how to fill out
51:51 - these 4 items items whatever
52:07 - yeah dude I'm so distracted
52:18 - whoa we're really moving on now people
52:21 - moving on all the options for how to
52:24 - configure an ml5 neural network are on
52:26 - the documentation page on the reference
52:37 - all of the options for how to configure
52:39 - an ml5 all of the options for how to
52:44 - configure an m5 neural network you can
52:46 - find on the documentation page for the
52:48 - reference I'm just you starting with
52:49 - these four basic properties input
52:52 - outputs tasks and debug so let's come
52:54 - over here to the white board and let's
52:56 - diagram out what's going on now remember
52:59 - we're starting with the pose that
53:00 - machine learning model we're sending an
53:07 - image into that model as the input the
53:12 - pose that model then takes that image
53:14 - and does pose estimation making a guess
53:17 - as to where all the key points are on
53:19 - the human body that it sees
53:33 - and all those points come in the form of
53:36 - XY pairs coordinates here's my elbow
53:39 - here's my shoulder here's my ear it
53:41 - doesn't have any or whatever nose
53:43 - there's 17 of them 17 pairs you can't
53:47 - see that there's 17 of them are 17 XY
53:58 - pairs so spoiled by the editing now just
54:08 - not I should not allow myself to have
54:09 - editing anymore it's ruining me their
54:14 - SEP and that's 17 XY pairs
54:27 - all of this data is what I want to send
54:31 - in as the input to my ml5 neural network
54:34 - and I want my ml 5 neural network to
54:43 - take all this data and give it a label
54:45 - this is pose a B or YMCA whatever those
54:49 - labels might be dab no Deb that's a
54:51 - terrible idea
54:57 - [Laughter]
55:07 - all these XY pairs what I ml5 neural
55:11 - network will take all these XY pairs and
55:13 - classify them into a given pose that has
55:16 - a label it's a dab pose or a Saturday
55:19 - Night Fever pose I don't know what kind
55:21 - of pose like me to make I'll do YMCA why
55:23 - not
55:36 - this now tells me how I want to
55:39 - configure my neural network I want to
55:41 - send it 17 pairs of numbers that's 34
55:45 - inputs and I wanted to classify those 34
55:48 - numbers into one of four labels that is
55:51 - four outputs
56:07 - thirty four inputs four outputs the task
56:14 - is classification and I do want to see
56:19 - debugging as I'm training the model and
56:25 - I have to give those options whoops and
56:27 - I have to give those options to the mo5
56:29 - neural network itself
56:46 - are we on time
56:50 - I'm gonna take a break in a few minutes
57:13 - now here is where things get kind of
57:15 - complicated right I have to tell the
57:17 - sketch that I want to give it a pose
57:20 - through some interactivity like maybe I
57:22 - type the key Y and then I need to run
57:25 - over here oh oh why did it get so slow
57:30 - is there a memory leak they stopped and
57:34 - started again what just happened there
57:49 - oh my god
57:53 - is this sketch running
58:07 - I think I need to give my computer a
58:10 - break geez Louise
59:11 - yeah all right why don't we do this I
59:23 - wonder if I just prop this up to let the
59:28 - bottom breathe of the laptop a little
59:31 - bit that might help let's give this
59:38 - let's give this a little break and will
59:41 - I will do its it is 11 so it's a good
59:45 - time for me to take my break and the
59:52 - room is hot yeah yeah let's I can air
59:54 - out there period all right this week
59:56 - this week let me take a minute to thank
60:03 - today's sponsor brilliant dot org so
60:08 - I've been a user of brilliant for quite
60:10 - a while now I you know one of the things
60:12 - I love to do at crossword puzzles write
60:14 - great and brilliant at org has actually
60:16 - taken the place of a lot of the time
60:17 - that I used to spend doing crossword
60:19 - puzzles in a wonderful way because
60:20 - there's all sorts of other brain teasers
60:22 - and puzzles and learning things but let
60:24 - me tell you something that is exciting
60:25 - about brilliant org which I didn't know
60:28 - about till very recently when they let
60:30 - me know about this imma knock something
60:33 - off your holiday list potentially if
60:35 - you're looking for a gift because what
60:37 - you can do for the holidays especially
60:39 - if you don't want to buy like a physical
60:41 - thing is you can get somebody something
60:46 - you can get somebody a premium
60:47 - subscription to brilliant so they have a
60:50 - special let me go to the website here
60:53 - and you will see all these different
60:58 - buttons there we go I'm going to I'm
61:05 - gonna close these oh the fans stop
61:07 - Fanning that's good I'm gonna go to
61:09 - brilliant org I'm logged in here on my
61:15 - account which is a premium account and
61:17 - you can see right up here this holiday
61:19 - season spark a lifelong love
61:22 - learning so you know for your niece your
61:25 - friend your nephew your cousin your
61:29 - mother I don't know who I've suspect
61:33 - that they might not have brilliant org
61:34 - on their list but they might be somebody
61:36 - who would really enjoy it so it's it's
61:41 - I'm off my game here for so many
61:44 - different reasons but um so here's some
61:48 - new footage of their website that you
61:50 - can see how these fun interactive
61:52 - puzzles are in action it's a really nice
61:54 - way to nurture curiosity build
61:56 - confidence and develop problem-solving
61:57 - skills crucial at school
61:59 - job interviews or career so um what I
62:02 - like to do so you can you can go to
62:03 - brilliant org slash coding train and
62:05 - grab a gift subscription there if you
62:09 - can also you can also through the the
62:17 - the link you can get a discount on the
62:20 - premium subscription and what I like to
62:24 - do on the coding train when I take this
62:26 - little break here is to look at the
62:28 - day's daily challenge and it's today's
62:32 - daily challenge there's a bunch of them
62:34 - actually one of them I was scrolling
62:35 - through I think oh yeah this one I
62:38 - already looked at this one don't be left
62:40 - with the lemon let me click on that this
62:43 - particular challenge I was thinking you
62:46 - might be able to do this with the
62:47 - minimax algorithm which is my most
62:49 - recent coding challenge it's a rainy
62:52 - boring day so you and a friend decide to
62:54 - play a game after finding 30 tasty
62:56 - cherries on one very sour lemon you'll
62:58 - take turns eating either one or two
63:00 - fruits so the last person to take a turn
63:06 - is gonna get stuck with the lemon so is
63:08 - there a strategy to a few so if your
63:11 - friend knows the strategy always makes
63:12 - the best possible move if you get the
63:14 - first move while eating one or two
63:16 - cherries give you a better chance of
63:17 - winning this is basically exactly like
63:19 - talking about the minimax algorithm I
63:21 - love that which is what I did in a Kurt
63:22 - code easily so if anybody bothers to try
63:25 - to code this game and use the minimax
63:26 - algorithm I would love to hear about
63:28 - that let me know one of the things that
63:30 - I that I especially enjoy with brilliant
63:32 - is when I
63:34 - the answer is you will eat the limit by
63:37 - the way whoops spoiler sorry about that
63:38 - but I love seeing people's explanations
63:41 - or so usually even if I know the answer
63:43 - what inevitably are configured out
63:45 - myself but it never happens as I find
63:47 - somebody who's come up with a more
63:49 - clever way of figuring it out let's look
63:51 - at the today's challenge this cut up
63:58 - however you like okay
64:01 - a dissection cuts a figure and
64:03 - rearranges the pieces into a new figure
64:06 - for example this deleted octagon below
64:09 - can be dissected into a square and for
64:11 - ISIL Isis aussolas right triangles okay
64:13 - yes yes yes
64:15 - comparing areas oh look at that oh that
64:19 - is wild first of all I just love the
64:20 - beauty of these patterns I mean it's
64:23 - definitely like inspiration for
64:24 - different kind of coding challenges to
64:25 - make of that
64:26 - create these kind of symmetrical
64:28 - patterns one side of the triangle is
64:30 - half the side of a regular hexagon what
64:33 - fraction of the hexagon is shaded all
64:35 - right so let's see these are your four
64:37 - options maybe people will want to tell
64:41 - me in the chat I'm gonna go over the
64:44 - whiteboard so let's say I think that I
64:49 - have a hexagon here I draw a hexagon yes
64:53 - one two three four five six and then
64:59 - there's like dissection here and then
65:02 - there's this triangle where we know that
65:06 - this triangle this is one half we'll
65:08 - call this art maybe call this are the
65:11 - side I don't what a good name for that
65:12 - is but the side of the hexagon so what
65:15 - is the problem all right so one thing is
65:21 - this would be the same triangle flipped
65:26 - on this on the axis of this side and so
65:29 - I could also put two of them here so it
65:31 - simply not one-fourth it's more than
65:33 - one-fourth is it one just visually
65:36 - speaking I don't think it's one-fifth
65:38 - right because look at these two I mean
65:40 - first of all I'm not drawing it really
65:42 - well here but you could imagine if I was
65:44 - so I could write a program to do it more
65:46 - to scale but you can see
65:48 - here right if I were to draw bot to draw
65:53 - that line there I have one section two
65:56 - sections three sections four sections I
65:58 - mean [ __ ] it's probably one six right
66:00 - just intuitively looking at it my guess
66:02 - is the way the math works out is that
66:04 - this section up here is the same as this
66:07 - one same as this one or maybe it's one
66:08 - is there a 1/8 option so I conceive ibly
66:12 - it could be 1/8 kind of looks like maybe
66:14 - there's more area over here I suspect if
66:16 - we start to do some calculations we'll
66:19 - find out that it's the same so so coming
66:26 - back to let's see so we could figure out
66:28 - the area of this right because if this
66:32 - is one half of the side that's the
66:36 - hypotenuse we know this angle oh yeah
66:40 - this is definitely calculate able hello
66:42 - it's right this angle right the this
66:46 - angle is 120 degrees right because one
66:51 - of the things about a hexagon oh you
66:55 - don't see me sorry about that everybody
66:57 - sorry about that
66:59 - one of the things about a hexagon is
67:01 - that you can divide it into how many
67:05 - equilateral triangles 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so
67:10 - this is 60 degrees so this is 120
67:13 - degrees so so right I don't know why
67:17 - this this angle is the one I care about
67:18 - this angle is 60 degrees so if this is
67:26 - what I'm looking at here if this is R
67:29 - divided by 2 then the height of this
67:32 - triangle is sine of 60 degrees equals
67:39 - the height of that triangle divided by 2
67:43 - times the height divided by R so we
67:46 - could do like an inverse sine I'm sure
67:48 - there's some like girls will do x
67:50 - squared a squared plus B squared equals
67:52 - C squared
67:53 - vagary and theorem so we could do square
67:56 - this I suspect then so
67:59 - then this is this is our Oh isn't it
68:04 - just the area of this triangle is our
68:07 - then oh no but we need this this length
68:10 - oh yeah I don't know our times this / -
68:13 - right
68:15 - H that's weird
68:22 - am I getting this right let's look at
68:24 - one of the answers okay I gotta move the
68:26 - move on to finishing my tutorial so
68:29 - let's let's see what everybody
68:31 - everyone's saying is 1/6 1/8 is too much
68:34 - if it goes right everyone's saying
68:36 - people are saying 1/6 in the chat my
68:38 - intuition and I think through the
68:40 - Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry I
68:42 - could calculate it exactly my intuition
68:45 - is 1/6
68:46 - I made it okay I make it overly
68:49 - complicated
68:50 - let's pick 1/6
68:56 - hit the net
69:01 - I got it right uh-oh look at this Oh oh
69:09 - I love that so this is a way of cutting
69:12 - it up oh look at that fascinating and
69:16 - you can see that that's 1/6 right
69:20 - because it's the equivalent oh yeah look
69:21 - at that
69:22 - oh that's such a brilliant idea because
69:25 - you can write write write so that you
69:27 - can see how this is the same as this so
69:32 - then if we have that triangle we take
69:34 - this part and just flip it over and put
69:37 - it on the top then you have that over
69:39 - there and then that's 1/6 of the whole
69:41 - thing that is such an excellent way of
69:44 - looking at it all right thank you thank
69:48 - you to brilliant for supporting the
69:50 - coding train it's really helpful to me
69:52 - and makes a lot of what I'm doing I'm
69:53 - sustainable if you're interested in more
69:56 - please go to brilliant org slash coding
69:58 - train you can check out all the do the
70:01 - daily puzzles for free and a lot of the
70:02 - content and then to unlock all of the
70:04 - courses and all the archive you can
70:07 - consider getting a premium subscription
70:08 - and the first 200 people who use this
70:12 - link will get a 20% discount on that
70:14 - premium subscription ok now I am going
70:20 - to take a short break to air out the
70:21 - room a little bit and get back to my
70:25 - coding to the tutorial that I'm doing
70:28 - today so maybe if you have a different
70:30 - idea but at it and you want to sign up
70:33 - for brilliant you can even just access
70:35 - this for free right now you could write
70:37 - your explanation or comments on one of
70:38 - these other ones or maybe make a p5
70:40 - sketch that shows all the pieces
70:41 - animating around that would be cool
70:45 - so I will see you in just a few minutes
70:52 - I still have my mic on it's not my mic
71:00 - on it's still talking to you I'm opening
71:01 - the door till I get some cool air

72:11 - [Music]
72:32 - all right so this is definitely the
72:35 - problem I see I have a super chat here
72:39 - which I will answer this question thank
72:41 - you so much for the supports on extremes
72:43 - but I don't know why this is certain
72:49 - that it's fully charged for before I
72:57 - started today then I just like drained
73:00 - the battery while it was plugged in what
73:06 - OCR in ml five days do you recommend for
73:10 - Europe and for text so this is an
73:21 - interesting question
73:22 - [Music]
73:23 - there is no library doesn't have a I
73:42 - [Music]
73:44 - would unfortunately that's nothing that
74:20 - ml five dance try to train him footage
74:22 - in ml five but you're really gonna
74:26 - [Music]
74:32 - [Music]
74:36 - sorry is the music too loud I will
74:42 - [Music]

76:08 - all right so I'm not sure what to do I
76:12 - got it up back up to 7% 8% it's moving
76:16 - on up now without the everything closed
76:18 - one thing that I don't know if makes a
76:20 - difference is my power cord was actually
76:23 - going through a dongle that also has
76:26 - HDMI out it really shouldn't matter so I
76:28 - removed it from that and just plugged it
76:31 - directly into the laptop I am also a
76:35 - propping my laptop up a little bit
76:37 - whoops which is giving it like this has
76:40 - some some space between the laptop and
76:43 - the desk which I'm wondering if that
76:45 - just lets it cool a little bit more
76:49 - easily keep cool so I don't know if any
76:54 - of that's gonna make a difference I
76:57 - really would like to continue with this
76:59 - but it will be a problem if it's going
77:02 - to grind to a halt or drain the battery
77:04 - so I'm not sure what how best to proceed
77:08 - I would like to see that get to 10% and
77:14 - nathan is saying your laptop was
77:16 - definitely fully charged 15 minutes ago
77:18 - from the live stream history and then
77:20 - suddenly jumped from a hundred percent
77:21 - to 0% that's interesting isn't there
77:25 - like a battery health this is a new
77:27 - laptop isn't there like a battery health
77:30 - thing that it like will tell you open
77:34 - energy saver whoo I haven't turned I'd
77:36 - never go to sleep just while I'm
77:43 - live-streaming because I don't want it
77:45 - to disappear if I'm just talking but
77:55 - alright I I don't I guess I'm gonna wait
77:58 - till that fence 10% can I answer any
78:00 - there's some noise to the audio
78:02 - somebody's saying hmm Ashwin is asking
78:08 - any special video on a million subs I'm
78:12 - in search of an idea for one frankly my
78:15 - idea of course that you are all are
78:17 - probably familiar with is to make a live
78:22 - stream where I read this entire book
78:24 - entitled a million random digits with
78:27 - 100,000 normal DVF's I would skip the
78:29 - hundred thousand deviates and just read
78:31 - the digits but I just some calculations
78:33 - and that would take it would be a very
78:35 - long live stream and I wouldn't be able
78:36 - to do
78:38 - Simon is about to post his answer to the
78:41 - cut up problem so I could take a look at
78:43 - that and um I have to 10% yet I'm
78:53 - waiting for that to hit 10% and see then
79:02 - the other thing I could do is the other
79:08 - thing that I could consider doing is
79:13 - page 731 that's a great one is I could
79:19 - switch to using Visual Studio code would
79:27 - that sort of is the web editor
79:28 - contributing to like sort of probably
79:31 - not significantly I'm at 10% now let's
79:37 - give this a whirl
79:50 - whoops
79:54 - what happened to my password
80:27 - there we go
80:33 - there we go
80:36 - 10%
80:44 - let's see if we're back alright the
80:50 - camera would just focus we're back and
80:52 - smooth again alright I'm just gonna keep
80:55 - this stopped as much as possible so I
80:59 - think one of the things that will help
81:01 - here I'm already up to eleven percent is
81:03 - that if I while I'm doing the coding and
81:07 - talking if I don't have this just
81:08 - running which is just doing a ton of you
81:11 - know just like sending the video into
81:14 - pose that over route Ken is just using
81:16 - up a ton of resources so I think this
81:18 - will keep me going is eleven twenty
81:19 - let's see how far I can get anybody
81:26 - remember where I left off here alright
81:34 - how I remember
81:43 - now comes the tricky part
81:46 - somehow I have to figure out some kind
81:47 - of interaction where maybe I press a key
81:50 - to indicate a label for a pose then I
81:53 - walk over here I strike the pose and I
81:57 - have wait for it to like this camera has
82:00 - to focus and I walk over here strike the
82:08 - pose ah boy this is super frustrating so
82:15 - many things that I don't think of coz
82:23 - it's one more time I'm gonna just allow
82:26 - a bill that will edit out the wait for
82:28 - it to focus this is where things get
82:33 - kind of complicated because I need to
82:35 - call brain dot add data that's the way I
82:37 - add training data to my neural network
82:40 - so some I have to have some kind of
82:41 - interaction maybe I press a key I'll
82:43 - press the key Y and then it'll wait a
82:46 - little bit and it will know after five
82:48 - seconds four when I come over here to
82:50 - start collecting pose data for a certain
82:54 - amount of time then it will stop and
82:55 - then I'll come back over here and press
82:57 - a button and do something else so this
82:58 - requires a lot of thoughtfulness in
83:00 - terms of how I might build the
83:01 - interaction around that's I'm just gonna
83:03 - try to do it in a simple way that I can
83:05 - get it to work right here right now in
83:07 - this room
83:25 - for a better example of how you might
83:27 - really do this take a look at teachable
83:31 - machine I made a whole set of videos
83:33 - about classifying images and sounds with
83:37 - this teachable machine project from
83:38 - Google Creative Lab but they actually
83:40 - also have a pose model in there so what
83:43 - I'm what I'm actually doing nailed it
83:48 - [Laughter]
83:49 - for a much nicer example around
83:57 - interaction and collecting pose data you
84:00 - can take a look at google creative labs
84:01 - teachable machines so i've made video
84:03 - tutorials about training image models
84:05 - and sound models that can actually be
84:06 - imported into ml5 at this moment you
84:09 - cannot import the pose model into ml5
84:12 - well that's something that we're working
84:13 - on and I'm hoping that this video
84:15 - tutorial will lead the way to that but
84:17 - essentially what I'm building is a pose
84:20 - teachable machine I just won't do as
84:22 - thoughtful of an interaction as here in
84:25 - the actual teacher machine project
84:40 - you can see here in teachable machine
84:43 - for example there's a button that I can
84:44 - press and it's going to give me a
84:46 - 10-second countdown and then when I come
84:49 - over here after 10 seconds it's going to
84:56 - start collecting my poses for 15 seconds
85:20 - so this is a much nicer example I
85:22 - encourage you to look at it for
85:23 - inspiration of course that was terrible
85:24 - trading data but now I'm gonna go back
85:26 - to my code and try to implement my own
85:27 - version of this okay
85:49 - so let's use a variable to keep track of
85:52 - the program state and I will start the
86:02 - program with it in a state of waiting
86:13 - then I'm going to add a key pressed
86:14 - function
86:29 - and I'll set the label and I'll set the
86:37 - label to the key that was pressed but I
86:46 - don't want to start collecting the data
86:48 - immediately I want to wait a little bit
86:51 - so I'm gonna use set timeout and I'll
86:56 - pass in a function that I want to happen
86:59 - let's keep Mikey myself ten seconds I'm
87:01 - gonna need a lot of time which is ten
87:04 - thousand milliseconds and I will set the
87:09 - state equal to collecting then
87:34 - I'm thinking about this because I want
87:36 - to do another set timeout that's gonna
87:39 - it's gonna start to look really awkward
87:44 - what's a more elegant I mean I kind of
87:48 - want to use promises and stuff but
87:50 - what's gonna be simplest here I'm gonna
87:53 - i'm entering callback hell oh oh oh
88:00 - Friday that that's definitely Friday the
88:02 - 13th City hey
88:14 - once the state is collecting I want to
88:16 - look at where I'm getting pose
88:17 - information getting pose information
88:22 - right here in got poses so that's where
88:24 - I want to add data to the model
88:47 - so I added an if statement here to see
88:49 - if I'm collecting in theory I would add
88:52 - data to the model but I'm not ready to
88:54 - do that just yet let's just console.log
88:56 - the word collecting the scene that this
88:58 - works I'm gonna run the sketch I'm gonna
89:06 - press Y and ten seconds from now would
89:13 - be nice if I built the timer into this
89:24 - how about for debugging I came just a
89:26 - one second and let's also console.log
89:33 - the label I'm gonna press Y okay I have
89:46 - to click over here maybe I'm gonna press
89:48 - Y is there already Kyoto and there we go
89:54 - okay got the why
90:01 - oh it's not seeing any poses collecting
90:08 - all right it wasn't collecting until it
90:11 - actually saw a pose so that's fine I
90:15 - think you go be go back and do this
90:17 - again
90:29 - let's stop
90:32 - I think by the way having the power
90:34 - plugged in through this pass-through
90:35 - device was what was causing the problem
90:38 - okay I think I understand what I'm doing
90:44 - now so let me do it again okay right
90:54 - else statement for not collecting yes
90:56 - yes I see I see okay see you later check
91:00 - the college I love that making okay to
91:08 - keep track of what's going on in the
91:09 - sketch I'm gonna use a variable to keep
91:10 - track of this to keep track of the flow
91:17 - of the sketch let me add a variable
91:18 - called state and I'll just initialize it
91:22 - to waiting and then I will add the key
91:25 - pressed function and when I press the
91:30 - key I want to say state equals
91:32 - collecting only I don't want to start
91:35 - collecting immediately I want to wait a
91:37 - little bit because it's gonna take me
91:38 - some time to walk over there and get
91:40 - into my pose so I'll use set timeout for
91:42 - a delay set timeout is a built-in
91:45 - function in JavaScript it's not part of
91:47 - p5 that will execute a function after a
91:49 - certain amount of time and maybe I want
91:50 - to execute this function after a certain
91:52 - amount of milliseconds so I can put a
91:54 - little function inside here I could use
91:57 - the arrow syntax and there's a variety
91:59 - of ways I could approach this let's just
92:00 - say 10 seconds later right so when I
92:08 - press the key 10 seconds later set the
92:10 - state equal to collecting let's also
92:14 - have a variable called target label and
92:17 - I'll set the target label equal to the
92:22 - key that was pressed
92:39 - all right so I have this function going
92:42 - when I press the key that whatever key I
92:43 - press is a target label I want to see
92:45 - that in the console and then ten seconds
92:47 - later I want to see it say that it's
92:49 - starting to collect let me make that one
92:51 - second later so I don't have to wait as
92:52 - long all right and I'm gonna press the Y
92:58 - key Y collecting perfect
93:03 - so this is the right idea once that
93:05 - state switches to collecting I want to
93:07 - call the ml five neural network add data
93:11 - function
93:23 - and the place to do that is in the pose
93:27 - detection itself so if there is a pose
93:29 - the data from the pose is what I want to
93:32 - add hold on let me erase I want to I
93:38 - want to use the whiteboard again and I
93:41 - realize I have all this hexagon stuff
93:45 - this eraser is the worst 11:30
93:59 - I was hoping you'd be done by 12:00 but
94:01 - I'll probably go a little past 12:00
94:12 - okay
94:16 - where I want to call the add data
94:19 - function is right here when I have a
94:21 - pose so when I have a pose I want to say
94:23 - brain add data and then the inputs and
94:27 - the targets what are the inputs and
94:36 - target the inputs are all of the XY
94:40 - locations of the the inputs are all of
94:52 - the XY locations of the pose itself
94:54 - there's 34 of them I mean I have kind of
94:56 - an issue where the camera can't see my
94:58 - legs so I probably should ignore some of
95:00 - them but I'm just not gonna worry about
95:01 - that I could also consider using the
95:03 - confidence scores like maybe the
95:05 - confidence score the neural network
95:07 - could learn when it's a low confidence
95:08 - score to kind of ignore that point but
95:10 - I'll I'll ask you to try all that stuff
95:12 - you're making your own version of this
95:13 - I'm just gonna use these seventeen XY
95:16 - pairs so I need them to be in a plain
95:18 - old array and if you recall they're not
95:29 - in a plain old array they're in this
95:31 - post at key points which each has an
95:33 - object which is position X so I need to
95:36 - flatten the data whatever format the
95:38 - data is in I want to just put it into a
95:40 - plain array so I'm gonna grab this loop
95:49 - I'm going to create an empty array
95:51 - called inputs and I'll just say input
95:56 - stop push X inputs dot push Y so this is
96:08 - me going through the entire pose getting
96:11 - all the X wise putting them in an array
96:12 - which is the input to the neural network
96:14 - and what's the target it also wants an
96:23 - array but in this case it's one thing
96:25 - just the label so I can take the target
96:27 - label put it in an array and that's what
96:28 - I'm giving an ADD data function is that
96:33 - correct
96:33 - well let me look at the other example
96:37 - [Music]
96:38 - whoops where is that one neural network
96:51 - I'll just go to this one and I call add
96:55 - data oh I made it an object in this one
97:01 - oh well I think it'll work the way I'm
97:06 - doing it I forget that you can do it as
97:09 - an object or an array we'll find out you
97:16 - might recall in my previous neural
97:18 - network examples I was making objects
97:20 - that I passed in with named inputs and
97:22 - outputs so this is just showing you that
97:24 - you could do it either way if I want to
97:26 - have names for all the inputs and
97:27 - outputs I can build an object with
97:29 - properties if I just want a big array of
97:30 - numbers I can just make it a plain array
97:38 - okay
97:49 - but there's a new problem the new
97:52 - problem is but there's a new problem the
97:58 - new problem is once I start collecting
98:00 - the data I'm gonna strike the pose and
98:02 - maybe I'll collect like the pose for a
98:04 - little while I got to stop collecting
98:05 - the pose so let's go back up to where I
98:09 - started collecting the potent pose I'm
98:12 - gonna do something awful
98:14 - I was so painful I don't want to do it
98:17 - let's just do it animate out we'll
98:19 - revisit it later we will
98:33 - I'm gonna call set tile mat I'm gonna
98:36 - call set timeout again right inside here
98:39 - because a second later or 10 seconds
98:42 - later I wanted to stop collecting
99:17 - this might be some of the worst code
99:19 - I've ever written it's really awful to
99:21 - look at it's what's informally known as
99:23 - callback hell and there's a variety of
99:25 - ways I could approach this differently
99:26 - by using promises and a sink and a
99:28 - weight but in this case really all I
99:30 - want to do is set the state to
99:33 - collecting in ten seconds then 10
99:35 - seconds later set it back to waiting and
99:37 - I think this will work for me let's give
99:42 - it a try
99:51 - okay so I need to first press y one one
100:00 - thousand two one thousand three one
100:01 - thousand four one thousand five one
100:03 - thousand six one thousand seven one
100:05 - thousand eight one thousand collecting
100:18 - 10 seconds later should say not
100:21 - collecting all right so
100:41 - this is actually surprising works
100:43 - surprisingly well okay that worked it
100:49 - waited 10 seconds it been it set the
100:52 - state to collecting I can only presume
100:53 - that it saved all the data to the model
100:57 - no sorry okay that worked I think it
101:05 - waited 10 seconds set the state no it's
101:08 - set yeah yeah Thank You Nathan for that
101:21 - session I will I will
101:23 - let's have this discussion after the
101:25 - stream today cuz I would love some
101:26 - suggestions about how to do this Nathan
101:27 - is saying that I should properly I could
101:29 - do a challenge to properly implement a
101:31 - state machine which is what I'm doing
101:34 - okay that worked what I'm doing here
101:37 - quite poorly I might add is implementing
101:39 - a state machine so it might be nice for
101:41 - me to in a separate video which if I can
101:42 - ever get around to making it talk about
101:44 - a more sort proper way of implementing a
101:46 - state machine but this works I set this
101:48 - state variable to collecting 10 seconds
101:51 - later set it back to not collecting and
101:53 - during that time I am adding data to the
101:57 - ml 5 neural network immediately what I
102:01 - want to do right now is add a function
102:03 - to save the data because I do not want
102:06 - to do this many many many times so in
102:10 - keep rest I'm going to say if the key is
102:12 - s
102:22 - ml5 no sorry brain
102:26 - save data
102:41 - let me quickly try collecting that one
102:44 - pose again and make sure it can save to
102:46 - a JSON file that I can reload later
102:56 - press y got ten seconds now
103:07 - collecting
103:17 - not collecting so I can come back over
103:20 - here I can press s and I now have a JSON
103:24 - file that was saved let's take a look at
103:27 - that file whoops
103:31 - just stop the scheduler running why did
103:35 - I make it like
103:53 - okay
104:25 - and this is what that file looks like
104:28 - for every single pose it's got exes
104:32 - those are the inputs there should be 34
104:34 - of them zero through 33 and then it's
104:37 - got the Y's which is one label of Y so
104:40 - these are all of my poses saved here in
104:44 - this big JSON file great
104:46 - I can now train them I can now collect
104:48 - the data for all four of those poses
104:57 - let's see if I can manage to do that
105:12 - first why
105:23 - superstar collecting so now I'm
105:27 - collecting my why pose gonna move around
105:30 - up and down a little bit not collecting
105:37 - okay now I'm gonna do em
105:51 - collecting
106:02 - not okay did I really do all of these
106:08 - see I am see like this right
106:20 - really noisy data see
106:35 - and see hey hey one more a this is a
106:53 - good exercise
107:10 - okay alright now we save the data save
107:14 - you okay stop stop the sketch I've got
107:21 - the data two megabytes so that was a lot
107:26 - it's a large file but not ridiculous I'm
107:29 - gonna rename it to YMCA I'm gonna now
107:33 - upload it to my sketch
107:49 - and then I'm gonna comment out all the
107:53 - data collection stuff because I'm just
107:54 - gonna consider myself done with data
107:56 - collection and I'll to placate the
107:58 - sketch and let me call this one data
108:01 - collection I'll duplicate it and call
108:12 - this one now model training
108:42 - now I can call brain load data so as
108:46 - soon as I create as soon as the sketch
108:47 - run the next step is when the sketch
108:50 - runs to load the existing data now I
108:58 - don't need to collect the data I could
109:00 - load the data collect more data there's
109:01 - no so many ways you could do this but I
109:03 - just want to load what I collected
109:05 - previously and then when the data is
109:10 - ready
109:47 - train the model 4/10 so when the data is
109:52 - ready when it's loaded then I could call
109:53 - the train function I'm there's a lot of
109:56 - options I could configure train with but
109:57 - I just wanted to go for 10 bucks that's
109:59 - running through all the data ten times I
110:02 - might need a lot more when it is
110:04 - finished I want to just console.log that
110:07 - it's been trained and save the model to
110:09 - my downloads folder so that I have it
110:11 - saved let's see if this works
110:24 - hmm
110:27 - okay
110:39 - so I see the training debug happening
110:42 - but I don't so I see the graph pop up
110:51 - that would show me the loss while it's
110:52 - training but it never went down at all
110:54 - let's try giving it a hundred epochs
111:10 - this is not a good sign
111:18 - why have I done wrong I wonder if the
111:22 - way that I collected the label is wrong
111:32 - look back at the training data
111:40 - like does this need to say be called
111:42 - label can I not do it as an array
111:51 - [Music]
111:53 - let's test something here
111:59 - stop this let me go to
112:15 - I'm using that version of the library
112:17 - that I built yesterday let me make sure
112:19 - there's no like bug in the library
112:31 - oh I have the whole thing there okay
112:44 - who
112:46 - oh now I got something worse
112:56 - should've
113:07 - does it require me to do the following
113:14 - like this is this is how I did it before
113:21 - I'm gonna have to collect data again but
113:23 - this is fine
114:02 - yeah I don't think it's because of the
114:07 - way that I don't think it's because the
114:10 - pose data itself is focused kind of
114:13 - blurry I don't think it's because of the
114:17 - way the pose data is too similar that
114:21 - would certainly be a problem but I think
114:24 - something else is going on all right I'm
114:28 - just going to collect two poses wait
114:35 - hold on and then I'm doing the
114:38 - collection
114:49 - should be this I'm gonna change it to
114:51 - this
115:00 - so I'm just gonna do pose a and B I'm
115:03 - gonna do a little test here pose a
115:17 - this was posed a
115:29 - let's do pose be
115:37 - I'll just stand straight suppose be
115:53 - okay
115:55 - now I'm gonna press T for train ooh oh
116:00 - whoa that failed
116:05 - I didn't normalize the data I don't
116:11 - think I need to do that it should just
116:12 - kind of I guess I data
116:15 - I really should normalize it oh I should
116:21 - just save that data could that be it
116:40 - where what time is it
116:44 - definitely not going to be doing the
116:45 - regression brain and normalize data we
116:52 - were to save the data next time let me
117:00 - go back to this version of the library
117:12 - sorry let me do this again
117:27 - so this is pose a
117:38 - okay
117:41 - this is pose be I'll just stand here for
117:46 - pose be
118:01 - meditation okay that's pose beat let me
118:05 - save the data save that's the data then
118:11 - we try trading the model oh there we go
118:16 - I think I was just missing normalizing
118:19 - the data or I need to also like call it
118:24 - label
118:33 - so that's a good sign okay I did get it
118:36 - to work let me go back and see if I go
118:39 - back to loading
118:54 - let me put this back to for brain
119:01 - let me call normalize ah okay great so
119:12 - it just doesn't work without normalizing
119:14 - the data that totally makes sense
119:17 - because those numbers are huge so I'm -
119:22 - I'm a dum-dum as we all know and I can
119:32 - take this out
119:39 - comment all this out I'll leave that in
119:42 - there
120:03 - so let me go back to this
120:19 - well
120:23 - guess what I forgot to do something very
120:26 - important if I am creating a dataset
120:37 - that I'm going to feed in and train my
120:39 - own neural network model I better
120:41 - normalize that data right these numbers
120:44 - are pixel values my canvas is 640 by 480
120:52 - so these numbers are really large values
120:55 - which aren't going to work well with the
120:57 - way that that I've got a I got a stall
121:05 - anyway because I need the laptop to
121:07 - start calming down
121:19 - what is the data that I'm collecting
121:20 - these XY values are on my p5 canvas
121:29 - which has a rillette resolution of 640
121:32 - by 480 so they're large values they need
121:34 - to be normalized down to a standard
121:36 - between 0 & 1 so I'm gonna let the ml v
121:39 - library take care of that for me by just
121:41 - adding the normalized data function
121:55 - oh wait a second let me just change this
122:01 - back because I want to leave it as it
122:07 - was
122:29 - so right here in trade so right here in
122:32 - data ready before I train the model I
122:34 - can call normalized data let's run it
122:40 - one more time let's just go down to 50
122:42 - epochs
122:52 - and there we go now I see a loss going
122:55 - down the way I had hoped it would
123:17 - and the model is trained and presumably
123:19 - saved to my downloads folder let's go
123:21 - take a look
123:31 - because I was trying this multiple times
123:34 - I have a mess of files here in the
123:36 - Downloads folder so what I want it
123:41 - because I was doing this multiple
123:43 - because I was doing this multiple times
123:45 - I have a mess of files down here in the
123:47 - in the Downloads folder but the one that
123:49 - was most recent is number five
124:02 - I'm going to get rid of everything and
124:04 - just rename these back to the default
124:07 - names
124:18 - and now I can upload the model that I
124:21 - train back to the p5 web editor let's
124:26 - duplicate the sketch one more time I'm
124:29 - gonna call this pose net deploy let's
124:37 - create a folder called oops let's create
124:43 - a folder called model mode let's create
124:52 - a folder call it model add the model
125:00 - files what
125:13 - it complained at me but I think it
125:15 - actually worked I can see the files over
125:19 - here
125:50 - and now instead of loading the data I
125:52 - can load the trained model
126:06 - but if you recall from the previous
126:08 - videos there are three files for the
126:11 - model so I need to create an object to
126:13 - store all three file names
126:35 - here we go
126:37 - there we go
126:46 - before Matt for how that has to be I can
126:48 - find on the reference page for ml5
126:50 - neural network copy this to clipboard
126:54 - bring it over here and put in my path
127:02 - which is just called model
127:31 - let's run the sketch and see if I could
127:34 - just get mod already here in the console
127:36 - oh oh I'm just missing a quote thank
127:42 - goodness and I'm in consistently using
127:45 - single double quotes let's fix that oh
127:49 - it's not neural network I called it
127:52 - brain so close pose that ready pose net
127:58 - ready huh oh I have a callback for pose
128:08 - net for when it's ready called model
128:10 - loaded so this needs to be I'll call
128:13 - this brain loaded so remember we're
128:21 - using two machine learning models here
128:23 - pose net which is doing the pose
128:25 - estimation then the outputs of that
128:26 - model are going into my own neural
128:28 - network that I've trained called brain
128:30 - let's try this one more time post
128:34 - ossification ready pose net ready
128:36 - wonderful incidentally the
128:38 - classification model was loaded first
128:40 - because pose that actually has to reach
128:42 - out to the cloud and download the model
128:44 - from Google servers
128:56 - all right everyone we're so close to
128:59 - being done with this we are so close to
129:10 - being done with this just a couple more
129:12 - steps once my brain is loaded I can
129:15 - actually ask it to classify so I can say
129:18 - brain doc classify inputs and when
129:22 - you've got a result call got results the
129:26 - question is what are those inputs these
129:30 - are those inputs the same thing I did
129:32 - when I was collecting the training data
129:33 - grabbing the XY pairs flattening them
129:36 - into an array I need to do that for the
129:38 - inputs that I'm sending in when I'm
129:40 - deploying the model asking it to guess
129:41 - asking it to do that classification
129:53 - oops
129:58 - so I can grab this exact same code Oh
130:06 - weird why is that if collecting gone
130:16 - I guess I took that out at some point
130:20 - that's weird
130:26 - didn't I have like an if state I guess I
130:33 - took that out at some point that's weird
130:36 - hopefully I had it in there when I was
130:38 - actually collecting the data oh I wasn't
130:42 - just collecting all the time was I weird
130:48 - uh does anyone remember I must have
130:55 - taken that out
131:02 - all right
131:06 - here's the loop before here's the loop
131:09 - from the data here's the loop from the
131:12 - data collection where I flattened it
131:14 - into a single array I can grab that this
131:19 - shouldn't even be in there anymore
131:34 - and I can bring that in here
131:37 - but I'm gonna once I get the result want
131:40 - to do this again so really I should take
131:42 - all of this write a new function called
131:45 - classify pose make sure there is a pose
131:54 - in the first place I hate how by the way
132:01 - when I do the autoformat it like sets me
132:03 - back up to the top there's got to be a
132:05 - way to tell it not to do that how to
132:07 - file that as a issue driving me crazy
132:17 - then once the brain is loaded just call
132:20 - classify pose
132:21 - I need the got result callback which has
132:29 - two arguments error results and I'm just
132:36 - gonna say console.log results index 0
132:40 - dot label that's console.log the whole
132:50 - results as well so in theory the first
132:54 - pose I get should be if there's a pose
132:58 - when the brain is loaded oh there won't
133:00 - be so I'm gonna have to I'm gonna put
133:02 - the recursive loop call in here and call
133:05 - classify pose again so the idea is when
133:09 - the brain is loaded classify opposed if
133:11 - they're suppose call brain classify what
133:15 - if there's no pose I'll never go get a
133:18 - result otherwise hmm what hey this is a
133:24 - really silly but I'm anticipating an
133:26 - issue that I'm gonna have so what I'm
133:27 - gonna do is if it doesn't detect a pose
133:30 - let's just say hey in a little bit why
133:34 - don't you wait like a hundred
133:38 - milliseconds and call classify pose
133:42 - again so that way it'll continue to
133:44 - check so at some point eventually there
133:47 - will be a PLO's pose it'll call brain
133:49 - dot classify when that's done it'll call
133:51 - it again if there ever ever loses
133:53 - detecting a pose it won't stop it will
133:55 - actually continue in just every 100
133:57 - milliseconds to keep trying again all
133:59 - right I think this is no way this is
134:01 - gonna work right let's give it a try all
134:08 - right
134:08 - who's ready ready I'm seeing a why
134:16 - I froze come on focus camera
134:23 - why Hey
134:28 - why si si hey why M what this actually
134:40 - worked sort of worked well let's just
134:56 - throw caution to the wind and draw the
134:59 - label into big letters on the canvas I'm
135:08 - going to set it equal to Y so that I see
135:10 - it right there at the beginning and at
135:17 - the end of draw I'm going to say fill to
135:20 - 255 0 255 no stroke
135:32 - was it called pose label
135:50 - okay there's the why I can make it
135:53 - bigger okay there's the why it's gonna
136:00 - be reversed it's gonna be flipped
136:03 - because of the so I'm gonna also put
136:06 - push here it doesn't matter why is
136:09 - symmetrical why and the see won't work
136:11 - and then pop here so that the Y's always
136:15 - in the center okay now when I get a
136:19 - result
136:31 - set it equal to that label I kind of
136:34 - want to see the confidence
136:40 - so I'll log the confidence to the
136:43 - console because I want to see how well
136:45 - it's sure it is about that particular
136:48 - label here we go it's fun to stay at the
137:21 - y-m-c-a it's my y-m-c-a denton and
137:34 - dinner dinner dinner - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10
137:45 - today we need needs to be capital
137:47 - letters
138:09 - [Music]
138:21 - did dis headed go slower dammit dammit
138:45 - huh I mean I think basically where's the
138:53 - slam so this is really done in terms of
138:58 - like a demon so Armour is asking a good
139:07 - question
139:08 - don't you need to normalize the inputs
139:10 - also the ml5 neural network remembers
139:14 - how you normalize during the trip when
139:16 - you train the model and when you load
139:18 - the model it keeps all that range in and
139:20 - re normalizes it for you so maybe that's
139:24 - not super clear that's a good question
139:26 - but yeah I so it would be really fun if
139:32 - I could actually use the YMCA song but I
139:36 - think what happens when you use a song
139:38 - on YouTube is it immediately copyrights
139:41 - it detects it as a copyrighted song and
139:44 - then puts ads and sends the ad revenue
139:46 - to the what you know the Village People
139:49 - which I'd be glad to support I'm glad
139:51 - for my ad revenue to go to which people
139:53 - maybe it's worth it actually it's
139:56 - definitely worth it but actually I don't
139:58 - monetize these ml5 j/s videos because
140:02 - this project is funded and part of the
140:05 - work that I'm doing at NYU it's
140:07 - everything's a very blurry gray area but
140:09 - I assign these videos in my courses and
140:11 - so when I assign videos in my courses in
140:13 - NYU I take the ads
140:14 - but I do have ads on a lot of the videos
140:17 - it helps with and I obviously have
140:19 - sponsors for the live stream which helps
140:22 - things move along Content ID or
140:25 - something something something Content ID
140:27 - alright um yeah let me just wrap this up
140:34 - I mean Matt Jie can do his own fancy
140:38 - split screening thing but so thanks for
140:50 - watching this I'm kind of shocked it
140:52 - works there's so much more that could be
140:55 - done with this first of all a question
140:56 - came up which is you forgot to normalize
140:59 - the data after your doing during this
141:01 - classification process and ml5 one of
141:04 - the nice things that does is it saves
141:05 - the normalization minimums and maximums
141:07 - from the training process and then
141:09 - reapplies then later so I don't have to
141:11 - read I don't have to call normalized and
141:13 - again that's happening behind the scenes
141:14 - um otherwise you know what other kinds
141:17 - of labels what kinds of other outputs
141:19 - you know could I play different drum
141:20 - beats based on opposed what other kinds
141:24 - of things could you classify if I
141:25 - collected a much larger data set if I
141:27 - was more thoughtful about how I was
141:29 - collecting the data could I get this to
141:30 - be much more accurate give this a try
141:32 - make something what I definitely also
141:35 - want to do which I'll need to make
141:36 - another video about is turn this into a
141:38 - regression so once again could I play a
141:41 - musical instrument could I actually
141:42 - somebody made a community darshan sorry
141:50 - is do a regression is to a regression so
141:56 - could I take that example where I play a
141:58 - frequency and alter that frequency by
142:03 - changing my motion my movements and in
142:10 - fact I could actually have the output of
142:12 - that regression be color that might be
142:14 - something to explore I got this idea
142:15 - from a viewer named darshan who
142:17 - submitted a community contribution where
142:19 - instead of painting with sound you're
142:22 - painting with color with a regression
142:23 - and that's really interesting because it
142:25 - requires you to have three different
142:26 - outputs
142:27 - and our a G and a B so take a look at
142:29 - that project and maybe I'll think about
142:30 - doing something with poses and color
142:33 - output in the next video tutorial I just
142:45 - never do this a little bit more because
142:47 - it's too fun to do did it what if I do
142:57 - this who I have an idea what if I only
143:01 - change it well did anybody see what the
143:03 - confidence levels are what if I only
143:05 - update it where is that happening
143:17 - how come I can't find anything oh you're
143:20 - not even seeing me I really have to go
143:27 - 12:20 I got 10 minutes here reasonably
143:32 - typos got results where Scott here it is
143:35 - ah I have an idea what if I only update
143:45 - the label if the confidence is above a
143:46 - given threshold
143:52 - let's take 75% maybe this will eliminate
144:00 - some of the noise
144:11 - - 10 - 10 - 10 dad didn't attend - did
144:23 - it totally helps right because I'm not
144:26 - it's not flickering as much because it's
144:27 - only altering it if it's really
144:29 - confident about what the poses and I
144:30 - could maybe make that threshold even
144:32 - higher the M in the a her so similar
144:40 - you're all right about that it is able
144:42 - to get it though and there's something
144:45 - slightly different okay everybody all
145:21 - right I think I'm done for today
145:23 - thank you for watching let me save this
145:26 - the interesting thing is this sketch I
145:31 - think it'll still work even with you
145:33 - right okay I mean let me in the Navy
145:44 - okay okay darshan thank you
145:50 - [Music]
145:54 - a little out of breath but one more
145:59 - thing I want to say again unlike with my
146:02 - previous examples where I've trained
146:04 - models that do something similar based
146:06 - off of images and pixels in this case
146:09 - the pose data is more generic than I
146:11 - think if you go to the URL for this
146:14 - sketch which is in this video's
146:15 - description you could make those poses
146:17 - and hopefully it will recognize them so
146:18 - give that a try and I can't wait to see
146:20 - you in a future coding video all right
146:32 - everybody I'm so pleased that that
146:37 - worked
146:39 - [Music]
146:52 - all right any last questions before I go
146:55 - [Music]
146:57 - so off to come back and do the
146:59 - regression other time hopefully the
147:02 - focus wasn't so bad in this but if it is
147:06 - it is what it is
147:07 - [Music]
147:23 - thank you everybody thank you all
147:33 - goodbye goodbye
147:34 - it was great I appreciate it I
147:36 - appreciate you thanks for watching I
147:38 - will be back on Monday to livestream the
147:42 - ITP show somehow have to figure that out
147:45 - [Music]
147:52 - what will be the next challenge well I
147:54 - did spin though this is a good question
147:55 - I did spin the wheel work good and and
148:00 - you can check you can look for a David
148:01 - Schneider a viewer of the coding train
148:03 - has been creating this started this
148:05 - repository for a wheel spinner to pick
148:07 - coding topics and the last time I did it
148:10 - it came on something which were turned
148:12 - into I'm gonna do the Hilbert curve so
148:14 - but I'm hoping to do that as a coding in
148:16 - the Cabana video over the holiday break
148:19 - so maybe I'm really waiting for a nice
148:21 - day where there's a big snowstorm like
148:23 - snook snowy Cody go back it's gonna be
148:25 - very cold in there there's no heat but
148:27 - that's my plan
148:30 - [Music]
148:32 - connecting the dots game using p5 that
148:35 - would be fun
148:36 - hi haha lol I'm glad you're starting to
148:39 - learn to code also do things that aren't
148:43 - coding also it will help you with your
148:47 - coding
148:49 - [Music]
149:03 - [Music]
149:29 - [Music]
149:33 - nathan is asking great question
149:35 - Nathan says I saw you had a word to vex
149:38 - series in which you never did the actual
149:39 - machine learning part yeah I ran into an
149:41 - issue which is that the ml5 were Tyvek
149:44 - in limitation which I was a part of
149:46 - working on we never kind of got it
149:48 - anywhere that was viable and so I kind
149:51 - of like just lost track of that I would
149:55 - love to come back to that it also is
149:57 - like when I don't have a course that I'm
149:59 - teaching that uses the stuff I tend to
150:01 - not focus on it like this pose
150:03 - classifications up and everything is
150:04 - something I was working on all semester
150:06 - so that's why I really wanted to get
150:07 - this stuff done I assure asks thank you
150:14 - are you interested in webassembly
150:16 - yes I am interested in web assembly do I
150:23 - know anything about it I'm interested
