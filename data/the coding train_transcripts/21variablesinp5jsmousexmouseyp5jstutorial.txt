00:02 - Hello, variables,
p5.js, JavaScript, I'm
00:06 - just speaking in single works.
00:08 - OK, this is a video, where the
topic that I want to look at
00:11 - is probably going to be a
couple of videos, is variables.
00:13 - But we got to ease
our way into it.
00:15 - Well, before we even talk
about what a variable is,
00:18 - let's think about why.
00:21 - What's missing from the
programs that you are writing?
00:24 - In the previous
video, I showed you
00:26 - how to draw a static
thing into the screen.
00:28 - It could be a rectangle,
a circle, color it.
00:31 - And before you could do that,
we had to add two things.
00:40 - Blocks of code, I'll call them.
00:42 - A block of code
is something that
00:44 - begins with a open
curly bracket and ends
00:47 - with a close curly bracket.
00:49 - A setup block and a Draw block.
00:56 - Each of these blocks, by
the way, is a function.
00:59 - Functions are this
fundamental primary element
01:02 - of just about how everything
works in JavaScript.
01:04 - So it's going to be a key topic
throughout all of the videos
01:08 - that I make.
01:10 - And a function is
essentially a way
01:13 - of organizing a set up a block
of code, a bunch of lines
01:16 - of instructions altogether.
01:18 - There's a bunch of
Setup instructions
01:20 - and a bunch of
Draw instructions.
01:21 - I said last week--
or a couple days ago,
01:24 - whenever I made the last video--
01:25 - that Setup is a place where
you put create canvas.
01:29 - Create canvas.
01:31 - And create canvas requires two
arguments, with and height.
01:37 - And you get this nice
rectangle on the screen.
01:41 - A canvas for you to draw to.
01:43 - And when it's time to
draw to that canvas,
01:46 - you add some instructions in the
Draw function like background.
01:53 - Background 0 we'll give
you a black background.
01:58 - And then, perhaps, you might
add something like ellipse.
02:03 - 50, 50, 75, 20, it's a
weird looking ellipse, which
02:08 - would then look more like this.
02:12 - Anyway, something
like this, right?
02:14 - So this is what
we've got so far,
02:16 - there's a setup block
and a Draw block.
02:18 - Both of those things
are functions.
02:21 - There's a bit more to it
than just this idea of like,
02:24 - oh, create canvas isn't set
up and this stuff isn't drawn.
02:26 - There's a reason why we're
putting some things and Setup
02:28 - in some things and Draw.
02:29 - And it has to do with
the flow of a program--
02:33 - hope I'm recording-- a flow
of a program over time.
02:38 - If you've ever used
any piece of software,
02:40 - you know there's an
element of time there.
02:42 - You launch the software,
you do some stuff,
02:43 - some more things happen,
you do more stuff.
02:45 - It doesn't just, like, start,
draw a picture, and end.
02:49 - So a p5 sketch--
02:52 - a browser session so to
speak-- it happens over time.
02:55 - And these functions are
controlling that flow.
02:58 - How do they control that flow?
03:00 - Setup happens once
at the beginning.
03:05 - When the program runs, the first
thing that happens is Setup
03:08 - and it happens once.
03:08 - Which makes sense, you want to
create a canvas more than once.
03:11 - At the beginning, you
create the canvas once.
03:13 - Draw, however, does something
kind of interesting.
03:19 - After Setup finishes, these
instructions get executed
03:22 - and when it gets to the
end, it goes right back
03:24 - to the beginning.
03:25 - Background ellipse,
to the end, right back
03:27 - to the beginning, background
ellipse, to the end,
03:29 - right back to the beginning.
03:30 - This is known as a loop, and
it essentially happens forever.
03:34 - It happens forever until
a user closes the window.
03:37 - There's obviously
a lot more to this.
03:39 - You could stop and start it, you
can have lots of other things
03:42 - happen.
03:42 - But this is our basic
beginning flow of the program.
03:46 - Setup happens once, Draw loops
over, and over, and over again.
03:49 - I wonder how many times I've
talked about Setup and Draw
03:52 - in my life, probably like 250.
03:55 - But I enjoy it just as much
this time as any other time,
03:58 - by gosh.
04:00 - OK, let's go over and
prove this point, here.
04:03 - So here is a p5
sketch, and you can
04:05 - see that it is exactly
the same format
04:08 - that I looked at the board.
04:09 - There is a Setup function at
the top with create canvas.
04:12 - And there are a bunch
of drawing things.
04:14 - This is a nice example
that Lauren McCarthy
04:16 - prepared unknowingly for me.
04:18 - And if I run it, you can
see I love these colors.
04:21 - I love the pink circle and
I love the blue square.
04:24 - Now, it doesn't
look like anything's
04:25 - happening over time,
because it's just, like,
04:27 - a static picture.
04:29 - It's beautiful, but
it doesn't move.
04:31 - And maybe that's,
OK, maybe in life
04:33 - all we want to do is
make static pictures.
04:35 - But, assuming you want
to make things move,
04:40 - it's drawing the same
thing over and over again.
04:42 - What do we need to do?
04:44 - We need to vary what happens
every time Draw executes.
04:48 - Draw executes once,
twice, third time,
04:51 - fourth time, fifth time, what
if something different happens?
04:55 - What if the first time the
circle appears up there,
04:58 - then the second time
it appears down here,
04:59 - the third time it
appears down here,
05:01 - you'll have the illusion
of it moving down.
05:03 - Or-- even better yet--
05:04 - what if you could just say
every time through Draw,
05:08 - draw the circle
where the mouse is?
05:10 - So I could do something like,
ellipse where the mouse is,
05:16 - right?
05:16 - That should be fine, I'm
sure that's going to work.
05:19 - I'm being facetious, I guess.
05:21 - But, now [INAUDIBLE] you
can see that I have an area.
05:23 - So this is obviously like
expected parentheses.
05:26 - This is obviously
not correct syntax.
05:29 - P5, JavaScript,
it's not going to I
05:31 - understand your just
regular, old English language
05:34 - speak thing.
05:35 - However, this is such a
common problem, that p5 has--
05:40 - as a part of its library--
05:42 - a variable.
05:43 - A variable called mouse x.
05:46 - I'm going to put
mouse x in here.
05:49 - You can see that it's a
nice purple color, right?
05:52 - Because the p5 editor
recognized that as a
05:56 - built in keyword, a variable.
05:58 - And what this means
is mouse x is a word
06:02 - that stands for something.
06:03 - 100 is a number that
stands for the number 100,
06:07 - and can only ever
be the number 100.
06:09 - But mouse x is actually
referring to something
06:12 - stored in the computer's memory
that changes based on how
06:14 - the user moves the mouse.
06:16 - So, if I run this program again,
we can see mouse x is 100,
06:21 - maybe it's 200, maybe 300.
06:22 - So now, we can see that
no matter what I do,
06:26 - Draw is happening
over and over again.
06:28 - And it's always drawing the
ellipse where the mouse is.
06:33 - I mean, if you haven't
done this before,
06:34 - hopefully this is
kind of interesting.
06:37 - OK, so there's a couple
more things to this.
06:39 - There's another thing
we could look at here,
06:41 - which is kind of amazing.
06:43 - Now, what happens, then,
if I take some other things
06:46 - and put them in Setup like
this background function?
06:49 - I'm going to put this in Setup.
06:50 - Remember, Setup
happens just once,
06:55 - Draw loops over and over again.
06:59 - I haven't rerun it yet.
07:01 - This is when the background
was in Draw, right?
07:03 - The background is
always being filled,
07:06 - and then the ellipse is drawn.
07:07 - Background is still, the
the ellipse is drawn.
07:09 - What happens if the background
is drunk only once in Setup?
07:12 - You think about
that for a second.
07:15 - I'm thinking about it.
07:18 - Now, I'm going to
run this again.
07:20 - Look at this, every
single ellipse--
07:23 - from the history of moving
every time I moved it--
07:26 - is now visible.
07:28 - This is because we only drew
that yellow background once,
07:30 - and everything is
drawn sequentially.
07:32 - So this illusion of something
moving around the screen, only
07:36 - exists if you erase the
background each time
07:39 - through Draw, before
you draw the next thing.
07:41 - So this is something
you can play with,
07:43 - and in fact, this is
a pretty quick path.
07:46 - If I get rid of this rectangle,
and I say, like, no stroke,
07:51 - and I also add mouse y
here, and I run this,
07:56 - now, you can see I've
made a painting program.
07:58 - Which is pretty nice.
07:59 - Like, maybe I give
it a little alpha,
08:03 - which is the fourth argument.
08:05 - Maybe I make that a little bit
smaller, and I run it again.
08:10 - You can see, here's
a little program
08:12 - that I can use to kind of
paint something with my mouse.
08:14 - So this is actually a great
stopping point for this video.
08:18 - I want to look in
the next video at how
08:20 - you make your own variables.
08:23 - Oh, actually, no, I
have one more thing.
08:27 - I've been trying to keep
my videos at 10 minutes,
08:29 - there's a minute and a half.
08:31 - But in this painting
program, there's
08:33 - one more thing that
I want to show you,
08:34 - which I think is
really, really key, OK?
08:37 - So let's go back to
the board over here.
08:42 - And we have Setup,
that is a function that
08:46 - runs once at the beginning.
08:48 - We have Draw, that's
a function that
08:50 - happens over and over again.
08:52 - Let's add one more function.
08:55 - And I don't have a lot of
room on the whiteboard,
08:58 - so I'm just going to erase Draw
for a second, to put it here.
09:02 - And, so, pretend
Draw is still there
09:08 - and it has a background,
and an ellipse.
09:11 - And I'm going to add
another function,
09:14 - and I'm going to call
it mouse pressed.
09:21 - So I have now complicated
the flow of the program
09:25 - even more, in an
interesting way.
09:27 - Setup happens once-- and
only once-- at the beginning.
09:32 - Draw loops over and over again.
09:36 - Draw's just, like, a crazy
person like, I'm going to draw,
09:38 - I'm going to draw,
I'm going to draw,
09:39 - I'm never nobody stop drying.
09:40 - You can't stop me from
drawing, drawing, drawing.
09:42 - Mouse pressed is a
very patient person.
09:45 - Quietly sitting inside
just waiting and waiting.
09:49 - In fact, mouse pressed
might never ever happen.
09:51 - Program could run and that
code there will never occur.
09:54 - So this is what's known-- and
this is also a key concept
09:57 - in JavaScript, there's can
be so much more to this--
09:59 - as an event.
10:01 - When the user clicks the mouse,
the code here is executed.
10:06 - So Draw is just drawing,
and drawing, and drawing,
10:08 - and drawing, and drawing.
10:09 - The user clicks the
mouse, we take a break
10:11 - from Draw for a
second, we run the code
10:13 - in mouse pressed,
and then Draw loops.
10:15 - I don't know why I'm saying
we, the computer is doing this.
10:18 - The browser is executing
all these instructions.
10:20 - So now you have a bit
more sophistication, here.
10:23 - You have Setup, you have Draw,
and you can always interrupt
10:26 - Draw with mouse pressed.
10:28 - So let's go back to our program.
10:30 - I was like, do you
have any questions?
10:32 - But there's no way
for you to talk to me,
10:34 - and I want you to talk
to me somehow, some way.
10:37 - So, now, over here, what I'm
going to do to this program
10:44 - is I'm going to add
a mouse pressed.
10:49 - And what should we
put in mouse pressed?
10:52 - How about we take this
background function
10:56 - and we duplicate it
in mouse pressed.
10:59 - So you can see-- when the
program first starts--
11:02 - we make the canvas, we
draw the background.
11:04 - Then, always,
continuously, we just
11:06 - draw a circle wherever the
mouse is, so let the user paint.
11:09 - And then what can the user do?
11:11 - Now, there's a new feature here.
11:12 - The user is moving the
mouse, moving the mouse,
11:15 - moving the mouse, and
the user might say--
11:17 - who's me-- I might say,
drawing is not so good,
11:20 - I want to erase it.
11:21 - Clicking the mouse will
then execute background
11:24 - and it's gone.
11:25 - And now I could then, you
know, try to draw a D,
11:28 - and do something where
I sort of draw an A,
11:30 - and I'm, like, trying
to make my name.
11:32 - And I don't know
why I'm doing this.
11:33 - So, this is pretty interesting.
11:34 - And you've got some tools, now.
11:36 - You're missing a lot of
things, but with color.
11:40 - What I would say now, as
an exercise, is use Setup,
11:43 - use Draw, use mouse pressed.
11:45 - You could draw more
than just a circle,
11:46 - see what kind of
painting program
11:48 - you can make that allows
the user, interactively,
11:51 - to kind of create a
drawing on the screen.
11:53 - It's a nice constraint
for an assignment.
11:55 - And in the next video,
what I will show
11:57 - you is how to create
your own variables.
11:59 - Beyond just what p5 offers for
you like, where the mouse is.
12:03 - So you can have something move
autonomously on the screen.
12:06 - And make that video
right now, by golly.
12:09 - Even though it's like,
after this very long day of,
12:11 - like, fighting with technology.
12:13 - That is nothing that you
need to worry yourself about,
12:15 - it's kind of a lasting one.
12:16 - But I'm going to do it.
12:18 - OK, I have to hit Stop.
