01:52 - let me pause for a second
01:53 - so this is now me just talking without
01:55 - the music you probably hear a little
01:56 - white noise which is
01:58 - the fan that i have going there's no ac
02:00 - up here in the uh attic where i am but
02:02 - it is quite warm all right
02:03 - let me know how this sounds
02:07 - [Music]
03:30 - do
03:32 - [Music]

05:22 - hmm
05:25 - [Music]
05:36 - do
05:48 - [Music]
06:24 - good morning welcome to the coding train
06:28 - from yet
06:29 - another studio location i have been
06:32 - moving and moving and having trying to
06:34 - stream from here and there and
06:36 - everywhere although
06:37 - very very little in the last month
06:39 - because i believe if you go back and
06:40 - look at the calendar and i'm just
06:42 - checking to see that
06:43 - my audio is working and there's a
06:44 - picture of me on my monitor over here
06:47 - that the last time i live streamed it
06:48 - was definitely the month of july
06:51 - um and it was towards the end of july it
06:52 - might have been something like july 22nd
06:54 - but i am back
06:56 - to what i hope might actually be a
06:59 - regular
07:00 - weekly saturday morning at exactly this
07:03 - time it's morning for me
07:04 - 10 a.m live stream so um i've got a lot
07:08 - of new stuff here in my setup but first
07:10 - i've gotta i've gotta admit some i've
07:11 - gotta
07:12 - i've got a confession i mean this is not
07:14 - too
07:15 - unusual for a coding train live stream
07:17 - the confession that i have
07:19 - i have but it's it's just much more
07:21 - extreme at this moment than it usually
07:23 - is i have
07:24 - no plan for today whatsoever not even
07:28 - like
07:28 - here's a mental list of a few things i
07:30 - want to make sure i say and then i don't
07:32 - have a plan i just have
07:33 - no plan so whatever is coming out of my
07:35 - mouth talking to you right now is just
07:38 - whatever i'm happening
07:39 - to think of of the moment but i really
07:42 - wanted to make sure that i came
07:44 - and that i um turned the buttons on
07:48 - to live stream to really get back into
07:50 - the habit of it
07:51 - because to be honest it was a bit of a
07:53 - struggle for me
07:55 - i meant to do this last week there's a
07:57 - lot of complexity going on in everyone's
07:59 - life
08:00 - mine is no exception um i'm i'm i'm
08:03 - in a very like lucky and privileged
08:05 - situation in many ways that i have
08:07 - a lot of things easy but just figuring
08:09 - out how to kind of get over that hump
08:10 - and back to uh being with you the people
08:14 - of the internet
08:15 - uh the coding train passengers if you
08:17 - will um
08:18 - and i really missed that and i wanted to
08:21 - uh just kind of
08:22 - rip off the band-aid and be back here so
08:24 - here i am
08:26 - what's next anything you do will be good
08:29 - says uh amannaski uh glad to see you
08:34 - hello there says andy uh joshua says we
08:37 - love having you back okay so this is
08:38 - helping
08:39 - it's nice to see these nice comments in
08:41 - the youtube
08:42 - uh chat so um
08:46 - oh code garden is here just wing it uh k
08:49 - weekman
08:49 - who by the way even though like i know
08:51 - your full name i can never refer to k
08:53 - weekman as anything other than gay week
08:57 - also i'm slightly afraid i'm going to
08:58 - mispronounce your first name because um
09:01 - i know there are different
09:01 - pronunciations of it alka says hello
09:04 - um and so uh glauco
09:07 - sends me a nice lovely little super chat
09:09 - there
09:10 - miss you pal welcome back so um
09:14 - so maybe this wasn't entirely true
09:16 - because i do have a bit of a plan for
09:18 - today
09:19 - my only plan the thing that i thought of
09:21 - as i was frantically this morning like
09:23 - plugging in all the
09:24 - wires and cables was to let me get
09:26 - organized for this fall
09:30 - i did this at the beginning of the
09:31 - summer uh i think probably in may and
09:34 - um let me pull that up here for a second
09:36 - um and while i'm here i just want to
09:38 - thank
09:39 - the sponsor for today's live stream if
09:41 - my buttons will work
09:42 - uh brilliant brilliant is a wonderful
09:44 - website for learning and interactive
09:46 - learning and exercises
09:47 - it's like so related to everything that
09:48 - i do on this channel so you can check it
09:50 - out at brilliant.org
09:51 - codingtrain i'll come and look at some
09:53 - of their courses uh later when i take a
09:55 - break
09:56 - um all right let me um pull open my web
10:00 - browser here
10:01 - uh and i will be i'm gonna try to pay a
10:03 - little more attention to the chat than i
10:05 - usually do
10:06 - um those of you who happen to be coding
10:08 - train members
10:09 - and are in both the youtube chat and the
10:12 - discord member
10:13 - live stream chat if you see a really um
10:16 - what you view as a meaningful or
10:19 - important or interesting question
10:21 - you could repost it for me um and i know
10:23 - simon if simon's watching simon has a
10:25 - whole
10:26 - discord bot q a bot system i don't know
10:29 - if we're prepared to use that today
10:31 - but um that would be helpful for me um
10:34 - if you want to
10:35 - um to uh
10:39 - um help me with any of the pulling out
10:42 - interesting questions but i am keeping
10:43 - my
10:43 - i have a one thing that i have is really
10:45 - exciting i can't talk too much about it
10:47 - because i have to i can't i have a new
10:49 - monitor and it's a 34 inch wide monitor
10:52 - so it's like uh i really want to show
10:55 - data i've got like open broadcast studio
10:57 - over here
10:57 - i've got the youtube chat here i've got
10:59 - the discord chat here i've got the
11:01 - youtube console here
11:02 - uh when i talk about brilliant i have
11:04 - some notes that i can just like pull up
11:06 - so there's like so much screen space for
11:07 - me
11:08 - it's very exciting uh let me go here to
11:12 - late night
11:14 - this is not coming up why why does
11:17 - the computer not know just to type
11:19 - whatever i wanted to type is it this
11:23 - brilliant okay ah sponsored by
11:29 - brilliant okay um
11:33 - so uh moving down along here for a
11:36 - second by the way oh my green
11:38 - my key is a little bit off you can see
11:40 - that right the light is different so i
11:42 - spent a lot of time
11:43 - working on the key uh for the green
11:45 - screen the other day
11:46 - uh because i in a new setup i've got the
11:48 - green screen here but um
11:50 - apparently the lighting you know in this
11:52 - attic where i kind of show you
11:55 - maybe you could see it in my youtube
11:56 - story i took a picture
11:58 - i know i'm this is going to be the day
12:00 - the live stream of tangents as well
12:02 - um can you see stories channel stories
12:05 - on
12:06 - um um just through the web interface
12:10 - it doesn't appear like where are my
12:13 - stories
12:14 - community i guess i have to go to uh
12:17 - no oh well if you look at my um
12:22 - youtube stories you can see i'm like an
12:25 - old
12:25 - fogie who doesn't know how to use the
12:27 - internet there's no tick tock coming
12:30 - there's no coding trading tick tock
12:31 - coming if anybody wants to be the
12:32 - official
12:33 - coding train on tick tock representative
12:36 - you know maybe we could uh
12:37 - reach a whole new audience there but i
12:38 - don't think it's going to be me although
12:40 - i do like to dance and i hear that's a
12:42 - thing
12:45 - i see sudoku generator visit here to see
12:48 - your dance
12:49 - now i know you didn't even hear me say
12:51 - that already because you're way behind
12:53 - so
12:53 - the other thing that's amazing to me is
12:54 - i am live streaming from my attic over
12:57 - wi-fi i didn't think that would be
12:59 - possible but the quality
13:01 - so i hear is just fine where was i what
13:03 - was i i was trying to find a picture of
13:05 - my attic okay
13:06 - never mind um
13:09 - so these this was a list of things i
13:13 - made
13:14 - earlier this summer um nothing's checked
13:18 - off that's
13:18 - horrible was there a different list i
13:21 - remember checking things off
13:22 - at some point uh to sort of keep track
13:24 - of some projects that i was working on
13:26 - oh i think i made some notes on a
13:27 - whiteboard at some point
13:29 - um so i did a bunch of these things um
13:32 - let me check them and read me noah um am
13:34 - i logged in yeah i probably have to edit
13:36 - it
13:36 - um but um so this is one of the things
13:39 - that i want to do today is really get
13:41 - organized for um this fall i don't know
13:43 - if david
13:44 - if david is watching i definitely want
13:46 - to look at a few um i see david in the
13:48 - chat look at a few community
13:49 - contributions
13:50 - i'll probably start with that so i think
13:52 - i can pull up the link
13:54 - for that um and i can talk about how um
13:56 - you can get involved with the coding
13:58 - train community
14:01 - cloned 81 asks how will i ever learn
14:04 - javascript
14:05 - there's so much to learn where to start
14:07 - oh
14:09 - so first when it's time for you
14:12 - to learn javascript you want to sit down
14:18 - at your desk pull out a sheet of paper
14:24 - that's just full of random digits you
14:27 - always got to have one handy with you
14:29 - mine is the piece of paper that fell out
14:30 - of my brandon pigeon's book
14:33 - take a deep breath put on some nice
14:38 - soothing music and read from your random
14:41 - numbers a little random number
14:42 - asmr here because i have a new
14:44 - microphone okay here we go

15:54 - happiness and joy
15:56 - this is really where i am in brooklyn
15:59 - new york
16:00 - in an attic with like a tremendous
16:02 - amount of expensive computer equipment
16:05 - a fan a page of random numbers and
16:08 - 574 people are here with me
16:11 - it's just amazing
16:15 - please do a factorial code tutorial on
16:17 - processing i like that idea
16:20 - ah simon oh simon everybody should know
16:23 - simon
16:24 - simon is probably one of the most loyal
16:27 - viewers of the coding train simon is
16:30 - a young a young person a young human
16:33 - who loves to code has his own youtube
16:36 - channel
16:37 - uh simon is always making stuff for the
16:40 - coding train contributing and i'm always
16:42 - behind i always haven't caught the last
16:44 - thing
16:44 - i haven't looked at the last thing and i
16:46 - apologize simon
16:48 - um did you see the mega
16:51 - fave numbers playlist on youtube
16:55 - i don't know what that is i have not
16:57 - seen the mega fave
16:59 - i think i better turn this off i have
17:01 - not seen that
17:02 - um if somebody wants to send me a link
17:04 - ah and it's a get github an issue on the
17:06 - website
17:07 - so let's move to the
17:11 - hey everybody it's time for your
17:14 - favorite
17:15 - segment on the coding trains with your
17:17 - host
17:18 - [Music]
17:19 - me the conductor of the trade
17:22 - all aboard today this segment is
17:26 - we're gonna look at your code and your
17:29 - community contributions
17:31 - i'm gonna just get my fancy fingers here
17:34 - type it into my keyboard
17:38 - [Music]
17:43 - press my magic button here
17:47 - and we're gonna go to the issues tab
17:51 - and somewhere here wheel link by
17:54 - gypsy dangerous gypsy dangerous
17:58 - viewer of the coding train uh thank you
18:00 - for making this beautiful
18:03 - wheel spinner so what this wheel spinner
18:05 - does
18:06 - uh basically um if you don't know
18:09 - uh if you go to thecodingtrain.com and
18:12 - any of the pages here like if i go right
18:14 - to this most recent coding in the cabana
18:16 - video on marching squares
18:18 - if i click on uh this button here i will
18:21 - get to the page that has
18:23 - a million links to every single possible
18:26 - version of code
18:28 - uh that i demonstrate in the video wow
18:30 - look at that
18:31 - uh and then it has a list of community
18:33 - contributions here so you can have your
18:35 - uh project listed here it's a wonderful
18:37 - way to share your work with the
18:39 - community
18:40 - i tend to i love to like click through
18:41 - and find them i actually often show
18:42 - these to
18:43 - students in my classes that i teach uh
18:46 - at new york university
18:47 - um and then there's a link down here at
18:48 - the below which you can add your own
18:50 - version
18:51 - so all of this happens through um this
18:54 - weird little thing here that's in the
18:55 - corner right here
18:56 - is where is the microphone i feel like
18:58 - it either needs to be like much more
19:00 - visible there we go or not visible at
19:01 - all let's try that
19:02 - um that messed up the sound let me know
19:06 - uh so
19:10 - what was i saying ah so uh the the
19:12 - methodology for adding your link to the
19:14 - webpage
19:15 - is by making a pull request on github
19:18 - and i um i have a video tutorial about
19:21 - that that i'm sure if you search coding
19:22 - train pull request
19:24 - will come up but we also have a um
19:27 - a page here that gives you instructions
19:29 - specifically for this page with a little
19:31 - look how crazy i look there
19:35 - different glasses uh different hair i
19:38 - cleaned myself up by the way
19:39 - i i don't know if there's any photos of
19:41 - me on the internet anywhere from like
19:42 - two weeks ago i mean i i could show you
19:45 - but i i hadn't trimmed my beard or cut
19:47 - my hair
19:48 - in like month it was like crazy so uh
19:52 - maybe i'll
19:52 - someone can remind me i can share that
19:54 - with you sound is actually better it's a
19:55 - solar liner
19:56 - amazing um
20:00 - so uh i encourage you to uh
20:04 - to submit your project through this
20:06 - method we
20:07 - the the community is very friendly and
20:09 - helpful um you can also join
20:11 - the discord i definitely want to spend
20:12 - some time talking about this i would
20:13 - like to ramp up
20:14 - the discord this fall that's kind of a
20:16 - goal of mine because on my agenda
20:18 - and i've got to give a huge shout out to
20:20 - coding garden with cj
20:22 - who's in the chat um on my agenda for
20:25 - this fall is a series of step-by-step
20:27 - discord bot tutorials um it's for the
20:30 - course that i'm teaching at nyu so i've
20:32 - got to make those videos
20:33 - on the coding train to release to the
20:34 - world and use them in my course
20:36 - so i want to do a lot more with discord
20:38 - this fall um all right
20:40 - but we have a a redundant system it'd be
20:43 - nice to automate this in some
20:45 - fancy way but david snyder uh
20:48 - gypsy dangerous um was generous enough
20:51 - to
20:52 - and um david apologies if other people
20:54 - helped you with this i'm not crediting
20:55 - everyone but
20:56 - uh you feel free to let me know in the
20:58 - chat um

21:06 - languages as possible
21:11 - my microphone is positioned wrong you
21:13 - need to tilt it back
21:15 - i'm afraid to mess with it too much
21:27 - as soon as i touch the microphone it's
21:29 - like this usb i need to get a new cord
21:31 - for it
21:33 - uh

21:50 - the day of the uh okay breaking news
21:53 - everybody
21:57 - is this it
22:01 - breaking news here on the coding train
22:12 - from w oh and arnov has joined a car
22:16 - breaking four breaking news
22:20 - oh no no wrong one
22:24 - that's not right where
22:27 - [Music]
22:28 - [Applause]
22:30 - welcome to the coding train you have
22:32 - just boarded the train as a passenger on
22:35 - the coding train thank you for your
22:36 - support
22:38 - with your membership of the coding train
22:40 - you will receive
22:42 - your very own random number we must get
22:45 - the random number book
22:54 - 28 461. oh my goodness and daniel
22:59 - granger
23:01 - welcome daniel granger you have boarded
23:04 - the coding train
23:06 - with your membership of the coding train
23:09 - you will
23:09 - get me to waste more time not actually
23:12 - coding on the coding train by just
23:14 - playing buttons here and talking
23:16 - incessantly i don't know why you're all
23:18 - watching this please go all out with
23:20 - your day
23:21 - seriously this is nonsense but i'll give
23:24 - you your random number
23:25 - oh you're getting a gaussian deviate

23:46 - good idea it's been so long since i've
23:47 - live streamed
23:50 - i'm new to the channel oh whoa the focus
23:53 - just went a little crazy there
23:54 - all right so

24:17 - emoji
24:20 - by the way it's very important
24:23 - that um you always keep like
24:27 - a geometry reference near you and i just
24:29 - want to show you mine
24:31 - this is my i guess i should switch to
24:33 - here
24:34 - this is my wonderful uh geometry mug
24:37 - which i actually purchased in bletchley
24:40 - park
24:41 - uh in the uk i bought this mug made it
24:44 - all the way back here it gives me my
24:46 - mathematical formulas i have coffee in
24:48 - it which is probably not something i
24:50 - should be allowed to drink
24:52 - but you know by the way one thing that i
24:54 - love about live streaming at home
24:56 - is i feel much more free to be
24:57 - completely insane
25:00 - because like when i was live streaming
25:01 - in a studio at nyu i felt like you know
25:03 - somebody might
25:04 - listen i had to like have some sort of
25:06 - semblance of professionalism and that's
25:07 - actually one of the big things i want to
25:09 - talk about
25:10 - how i'm intending to be a little bit
25:12 - more clear
25:13 - about how i'm separating the tutorial
25:15 - content
25:16 - that is more curriculum based and it's
25:18 - not really like serious academic stuff
25:20 - but
25:21 - um and the sort of live stream nonsense
25:23 - all right
25:24 - uh it was uh and thank you bren brassad
25:27 - for your super chat
25:28 - this is all too kind of all of you um
25:30 - venkat gudevillum is new to the channel
25:33 - all right
25:33 - so
25:37 - and by the way this live stream is gonna
25:39 - go until noon
25:40 - so i do have to turn it off at noon at
25:42 - noon my children will be up here like
25:44 - yelling at me because
25:45 - the one thing about this new monitor and
25:47 - pc streaming setup that i have
25:49 - is uh they like kids are nine and twelve
25:52 - and they discovered that it's the best
25:53 - gaming setup
25:54 - and they've discovered this game called
25:56 - fall guys i think that they love
25:58 - play it on steam not a sponsor but hey
26:01 - i'm available um and they actually want
26:04 - to live
26:04 - stream it won't be through the coding
26:06 - train but um if you're in join the
26:07 - discord
26:08 - i'll post a link afterwards if you want
26:10 - to join us this afternoon
26:11 - um playing some fall guys i think that's
26:13 - the name of the game mostly they play
26:15 - roblox
26:15 - and we've been doing a little four range
26:17 - roblox programming ah
26:19 - introduce the channel can you please get
26:21 - deep
26:22 - you're all i mean i can't i can't keep a
26:25 - thought together
26:25 - oh
26:29 - i think we ah we might need some random
26:31 - number reading again
26:32 - i wish gloria my my puppers would show
26:35 - up oh my goodness
26:38 - welcome kush
26:42 - thank you for boarding the coding train
26:44 - as a
26:45 - member you're all passengers you're all
26:48 - with me here on the coding train i love
26:49 - you all equally except for the ones who
26:52 - join as members that i love just like a
26:53 - tiny bit more no no no
26:55 - you're all wonderful i'm just joking oh
26:58 - this is all so silly let's
26:59 - give you your random number
27:07 - seventy one thousand one hundred and
27:08 - ninety thank you very much there we go
27:10 - okay uh so introduction to the coding
27:13 - train then community contributions
27:18 - so this is uh my youtube channel this is
27:21 - a fun
27:21 - i i really hesitate to show this because
27:24 - but i think people will enjoy seeing
27:25 - this
27:26 - i got uh one of those like gold play
27:28 - buttons which is very exciting
27:30 - uh and fun and i have it here uh you can
27:33 - see this this is the coding grid oh my
27:34 - goodness please stop joining already
27:39 - welcome charlie england to the coding
27:41 - thing
27:42 - you are a new passenger recording this
27:44 - morning
27:46 - and uh welcome uh i
27:49 - i usually say a bunch of nonsense and
27:51 - some stick and i've
27:52 - forgotten about it and there's only 10
27:54 - seconds left so i'm gonna give you your
27:55 - random number
27:56 - please i hope you're all noting these
27:57 - down because i'm not and
27:59 - uh 39 39 403 maybe i can do something
28:03 - with the rewards
28:04 - where when i end up sending people their
28:06 - custom
28:07 - uh train whistles you get your own
28:09 - random number like
28:10 - inscribed on today you guys are talking
28:14 - welcome to sa makwanzi
28:16 - [Music]
28:18 - welcome to passengers you've booked the
28:20 - coding train
28:22 - i'm really out of things to say i i need
28:24 - to take like an improv
28:26 - class or something like this is not i
28:28 - was not i'm like
28:29 - just here to make some javascript
28:31 - tutorials not to
28:33 - do this stuff i gotta take a nap i'm so
28:35 - tired all of a sudden
28:36 - up and your red number is 59 745 all
28:40 - right please take a break from joining
28:42 - people
28:45 - okay so the coding train is a youtube
28:48 - channel um
28:49 - and i started it let's so let's talk a
28:53 - little bit about the history of things
28:54 - so i i started making
28:58 - videos i think they still exist if i
29:00 - search like vimeo
29:01 - daniel shiffman
29:05 - whoa wow we're going to find some really
29:06 - old stuff
29:09 - [Music]
29:11 - who knows i was hoping my vimeo account
29:13 - would show up but
29:14 - um so i would say probably almost 10
29:18 - years ago now
29:19 - that is insane um i
29:22 - i've been teaching at a
29:25 - you're program for the introduction to
29:27 - the coding train and then an hour later
29:29 - i'm like back to the community
29:30 - contribution sorry i'll move this along
29:32 - more quickly
29:33 - so i'm i'm a graduate of this program at
29:35 - nyu
29:36 - uh and i've been teaching there for a
29:38 - number of years now and
29:40 - i used to just make videos for the
29:42 - courses and i started publishing them on
29:44 - vimeo
29:44 - um in 2005 i definitely was making these
29:48 - videos in 2012
29:49 - i think a little bit before then too um
29:51 - in about
29:52 - two so and the topic of these videos is
29:55 - our co
29:56 - it's programming programming and
29:57 - computer coding and the angle that i'm
30:00 - coming from
30:00 - is a term that's often used called
30:03 - creative computing
30:04 - uh creative coding i think that some i
30:07 - have some issues with that term but it
30:08 - is nice
30:09 - i think of it in a similar way to i
30:11 - think of like what creative writing
30:13 - like uh creative writing isn't something
30:16 - it doesn't mean that all writing isn't
30:17 - creative but it's a sort of like
30:19 - common term that we can understand when
30:21 - referring to
30:22 - fiction or poetry and a certain kind of
30:25 - of the
30:25 - certain kind of way of thinking and
30:28 - being with each other as we write
30:30 - so i think of creative coding as the
30:32 - same sort of thing and
30:33 - if you go specifically to like the
30:35 - coding challenges which
30:36 - it's a kind of insane that i don't have
30:38 - one of these since march
30:40 - although you might remember something
30:42 - happened in the world i mean it happened
30:44 - before march but it really
30:45 - started happening here in this united
30:47 - states in march so that's kind of been
30:49 - the issue here but um for me but um
30:52 - you'll see that a lot of these
30:53 - have to do with graphics and um
30:58 - uh you know generative art and just sort
31:01 - of like
31:01 - experimental stuff so that's the main
31:05 - topic i also use primarily
31:08 - um the tools that i use to program on
31:11 - this channel are
31:12 - primarily not exclusively but primarily
31:14 - from the processing foundation
31:16 - and actually if you go to the processing
31:17 - foundation website you'll find me here
31:20 - as someone who's on the board of
31:21 - directors
31:22 - i should also mention something really
31:24 - exciting here that there's a new
31:26 - uh project lead a moira turner for the
31:28 - p5.js project
31:30 - um the tool the tools that i'm using
31:31 - most right now are
31:33 - the uh p5 web editor which is made and
31:37 - the lead developer is cassie tarakisian
31:39 - and the p5.js library the new
31:41 - lead is moyra turner um so uh you should
31:44 - definitely read all about the processing
31:46 - foundation it's my heart and soul
31:47 - is with the processing foundation it's
31:49 - kind of like the focus of my work
31:50 - everything
31:51 - kind of like from teaching and youtubing
31:53 - all that kind of
31:54 - leads in or branches out from there um
31:58 - but one of the things that if you're new
32:00 - to this channel um i do have this tab on
32:02 - the website called beginners
32:04 - so if you go here into beginners there
32:06 - are really three
32:07 - uh pla playlists here right now this is
32:10 - probably the one if you're
32:11 - if you've never coded before this is
32:13 - probably the one that i'd recommend in
32:15 - that it's most recent
32:16 - this is the kind of thing that i
32:17 - probably should reboot every few years
32:21 - and it's getting a little bit out of
32:22 - date but you know i have i don't know
32:24 - how to manage
32:25 - like time and topics but someday maybe
32:28 - that will happen but
32:29 - if i go to here you'll see um
32:32 - the some of these videos are for more
32:34 - recent than others
32:36 - but really they're they're from about
32:37 - two years ago now but
32:39 - largely the same so this is you can
32:40 - learn to program it's all the very
32:42 - basics
32:43 - um i think this is maybe even you know
32:46 - i'm not an expert here but i think
32:48 - appropriate from like
32:49 - sixth grade and up so sixth grade is
32:51 - like
32:53 - 12 13 that's or 11. i should know this
32:57 - considering that i have a son who's in
32:58 - sixth grade
32:59 - like literally and he is twelve so must
33:02 - be
33:03 - somewhere around there um but when i
33:06 - hear so i hear the pitter patter of feet
33:08 - um so there's other people wandering
33:10 - close to the attic
33:11 - um in my house here uh
33:15 - so this is where i would recommend if
33:17 - you if you want to try the coding train
33:18 - stuff there's plenty of other resources
33:20 - on the internet that you can find you
33:21 - need to learn to code through my uh
33:23 - stuff
33:24 - but um you can find um the intro series
33:28 - here
33:28 - so um so i have i i have a bit of a sort
33:31 - of
33:33 - strange practice which has uh i've never
33:35 - really sort of figured out but i do i
33:38 - both have sequenced tutorials with some
33:40 - light editing
33:42 - and you'll find those all here on the
33:44 - website
33:45 - like in github git github for poets or
33:49 - nature of code simulating natural
33:50 - systems you can find these different
33:52 - like playlists here
33:54 - and then um i also i guess i also have
33:57 - i do these live streams which as you can
34:00 - tell if you're watching
34:01 - all 610 of you what it's a i don't know
34:04 - where you are in the world but right now
34:05 - on the east coast in the new york city
34:07 - area it
34:07 - is just beautiful out so um
34:12 - please this will be available for
34:14 - viewing later clearly i'm not doing
34:16 - anything but just rambling
34:18 - so enjoy the outside if you can uh but
34:20 - also hello to those of you who are
34:22 - watching from
34:23 - india like kartik uh that is just
34:25 - amazing and wonderful to me
34:27 - um but um i also live stream
34:30 - and generally the live streams have
34:31 - actually been the same a lot of the same
34:34 - content that's in all of these videos
34:36 - but just without any of that light
34:38 - editing so if for example here
34:40 - one of the most watched videos that i
34:43 - have on my channel
34:44 - which is a coding challenge number three
34:46 - the snake game
34:47 - this is um and
34:50 - oh i'm gonna learn machine learning
34:52 - apparently this course is about machine
34:54 - learning
34:55 - um hello and welcome to what today will
34:57 - be a 15-minute coding i'm logged i'm
35:00 - logged into youtube through my nyu
35:01 - program so this coding challenge if i go
35:04 - through it somewhere in the middle
35:06 - it says like there's like it says like
35:08 - stop for technical difficulties or
35:10 - something
35:11 - um and then here in the description
35:14 - there was a link to it oh no maybe it's
35:16 - a pinned comment yeah
35:17 - so the pin comment here now takes you to
35:19 - the live stream
35:20 - so if i go to this exactly i need to add
35:22 - this is now live stream number 32 which
35:24 - is like
35:25 - two over two hours long where i was
35:26 - doing a ton of um stuff i should really
35:28 - log in i have youtube premium
35:31 - um on uh other google accounts
35:35 - if like multiple youtube premium
35:36 - accounts are just really dumb i need to
35:38 - like get rid of one
35:39 - figure that out uh um but
35:43 - uh anyway so but one of the things that
35:46 - i actually would like to do this year
35:47 - that i'm hoping to
35:49 - figure out is just have a weekly live
35:51 - stream like this one
35:52 - which is just kind of chatting having
35:55 - fun
35:56 - looking at stuff speaking of somebody
35:57 - who does this well um cj in the chat
35:59 - has a lot of different kinds of live
36:01 - streams that he does on twitch
36:03 - that are sometimes just q a's and just
36:05 - like working through a problem in an
36:06 - informal way
36:08 - um so i want to try to do more of that
36:10 - um maybe saturdays
36:12 - at 10 from 10 to 12 and then fall guys
36:16 - steam games afterwards with my kids
36:20 - so that's um
36:24 - oh
36:29 - oh the new member track is panned to the
36:31 - right it doesn't be
36:32 - okay something was going wrong there
36:34 - okay
36:37 - uh i don't know what's going i'm looking
36:39 - at the chat there's some like things
36:40 - going on in the chat all right so
36:42 - um so that's
36:45 - that's that's uh that's my introduction
36:47 - to the channel i guess um i have a
36:49 - a a long uh ton of like
36:52 - probably almost a thousand tutorial
36:54 - videos that you can go back and find and
36:55 - i'm planning to do a lot more new stuff
36:57 - but one of the things that i really try
36:59 - to do is engage with the community so
37:02 - the main place to do that is through the
37:03 - discord
37:04 - i'm pressing a button um now uh which
37:07 - will pop up the discord link in the chat
37:09 - and also through the community
37:11 - contributions on the website so let's go
37:13 - back
37:14 - to
37:18 - the wheel spin time and bruno
37:24 - just when i thought i was finally gonna
37:26 - get to doing something
37:27 - [Music]
37:29 - i now
37:32 - have to welcome bruno
37:36 - two the coding trade the panic inducing
37:39 - timer right yeah good old days
37:42 - uh bruno your coding train random number
37:45 - is
37:46 - [Music]
37:48 - hundred and 28 one thank you for joining
37:51 - uh
37:52 - so i guess i can talk about membership
37:54 - stuff um
37:55 - in a little bit but um let's go ahead
37:58 - and look at some community contributions
37:59 - so i was saying
38:00 - david gypsy dangerous on uh
38:03 - helps put this together it pulls from a
38:05 - spreadsheet which is sort of duplicates
38:07 - of all the community contributions on
38:09 - the website if i've shown one already it
38:11 - gets uh
38:11 - taken off the spreadsheet and then this
38:14 - p5 sketch
38:15 - uh is populated with a ran uh with i
38:18 - think
38:18 - i guess ten one two three four five six
38:20 - seven nine ten and i can spin this wheel
38:24 - and when i spin it we're gonna we don't
38:26 - know what we're gonna get because the
38:28 - numbers are here
38:29 - we're gonna land on number 44
38:33 - and i think now if i
38:36 - do remove and view selected
38:41 - that's going to bring it up yes so this
38:43 - brought up a coding
38:45 - a contribution by gene loop uh called
38:48 - 3d tic-tac-toe oh this is exciting to
38:51 - see
38:51 - so the original uh one that this is
38:53 - based on
38:54 - is this uh coding challenge number 149
38:57 - tic-tac-toe
38:58 - uh i encourage you to check this one out
39:00 - original code and there's a lo
39:02 - this one has a lot of contributions wow
39:04 - look at that
39:06 - um and i also did a follow-up to this
39:08 - using the minimax algorithm to
39:11 - uh for an ai to play uh tic-tac-toe
39:14 - and let's look at um
39:18 - let's look at g-loop's uh version
39:21 - oh awesome what's the slider do
39:30 - what's that i can't oh this is the speed
39:32 - maybe oh and look at that
39:34 - for the when it when it wins i guess
39:36 - it's when it gets three in a row
39:38 - in this 3d space it like highlights it
39:41 - by turning
39:42 - on the stroke that is really cool i want
39:45 - to watch this again
39:50 - amazing work oh i love it when it's
39:52 - diagonal so one thing um
39:54 - i'm just going to switch over to change
39:56 - the url to
39:57 - full so you don't you definitely don't
39:59 - need to do this i
40:00 - i really like it when you're sharing a
40:02 - p5 web editor sketch to share
40:04 - the um the view that has a full
40:07 - because that way it has the top bar so i
40:08 - can see the name and the who created it
40:11 - as well as uh click over here and we're
40:13 - now at the code
40:15 - and we can see this um this is so cool
40:17 - to see so this is using
40:19 - wow the web i'm always amazed by what
40:22 - the webgl renderer can do
40:24 - um in p5.js
40:29 - great work um
40:32 - i assume oh
40:35 - so um uh k weakman is giving me a
40:37 - comment that i want to uh address in a
40:39 - second
40:40 - um um
40:43 - yeah actually i forgot what i was gonna
40:45 - say
40:48 - great great job oh you know i had all
40:51 - this energy and adrenaline and having
40:52 - such and then
40:53 - just like a moment there i took like a
40:55 - deep breath and like everything drained
40:57 - out of me and i feel like
40:59 - it's time to go take a nap all of a
41:00 - sudden um what was i saying webgl
41:04 - oh yes um if you happen to be if i
41:07 - happen to like come across
41:08 - your uh community contribution while um
41:12 - live and you're in the chat please let
41:15 - me know
41:15 - i don't know how we authenticate that
41:17 - but it's great then we can ask questions
41:19 - and chat about the code and
41:20 - you know i've done various things where
41:22 - i sometimes like even have somebody call
41:24 - in but i'm not really set up for that
41:25 - right now so maybe we'll get back to
41:27 - that in the future
41:28 - um so k weekman just passed along there
41:31 - was a message in the chat
41:32 - in this website learning noc
41:35 - doesn't have the playlist updated
41:38 - since dan is making new videos can those
41:40 - go in archive so unfortunately i don't
41:42 - know what that um
41:47 - i don't know what that's referring to
41:48 - which website it's probably this
41:50 - oh learning nature of code
41:53 - um these are the updated ones they're
41:58 - just as far as i got
41:59 - last spring so i guess i'll need more
42:01 - information
42:02 - but um what you should do if there are
42:05 - things that need to be fixed or out of
42:06 - date or broken on the website
42:08 - um go here to the github repo which is
42:10 - slash coding train slash website
42:12 - and uh file um post a new issue uh i
42:16 - would
42:16 - love to hear from you you know um
42:19 - there's a lot of people that help with
42:20 - maintaining all these github repos
42:23 - um and so you know we're certainly
42:25 - behind on on getting back to a lot of
42:27 - these
42:28 - like issues and questions but this is a
42:30 - place where you can um
42:31 - file a question or concern like that um
42:35 - okay can you please check out your
42:39 - community our community contribution of
42:41 - your seven segment
42:42 - delay okay i i don't really i i hesitate
42:46 - to start taking requests to look at
42:48 - uh community contributions that people
42:49 - are asking for in the chat because
42:51 - i don't know how to manage that but
42:53 - since it happens to be the first one
42:54 - that i noticed
42:56 - i'll say i am going to uh take a look at
42:59 - that
43:00 - but um that that's probably gonna be the
43:01 - only one otherwise i'll spin the wheel
43:03 - so let's go to
43:04 - um this was boswar who asked i'm gonna
43:07 - go to uh
43:08 - coding challenges seven segment display
43:12 - um and let's see can i how do i find
43:15 - yours
43:17 - will i recognize ah write down a rainbow
43:19 - clock by boswar
43:21 - chakraborty and anusha trapati
43:24 - excuse me my voice is just just uh my
43:26 - voice is changing it happens
43:28 - multiple times in my life why the key
43:31 - you can see ah okay rainbow clock let's
43:33 - take a look
43:37 - oh this is awesome
43:40 - september 12 saturday 10 43
43:44 - this like kind of cool background and
43:46 - now like there's all these sliders top
43:48 - left oh it's like a dynamic
43:52 - i can pick a color for the corners
43:56 - and i guess it interpolates between them
43:58 - so like if i slid them all
44:01 - down to here are these is this hue
44:03 - saturation brightness is it rgb
44:05 - i would love to know clocks are always
44:09 - an assignment that i often give in my
44:11 - creative coding classes
44:13 - it's a fun thing for people to be
44:15 - creative with and this
44:16 - is oh look at this oh it must be hue
44:18 - right because
44:19 - if i only have one slider and the color
44:21 - is changing it's most likely you
44:23 - this is awesome thank you for sharing
44:26 - this
44:27 - i love also to see that you're hosting
44:30 - it with github pages which is a really
44:32 - nice way
44:33 - to be able to host your work online for
44:34 - free that is something i really need to
44:36 - redo my github pages tutorial
44:39 - um i should be taking notes uh that
44:42 - would be sort of
44:43 - very helpful i think um okay
44:47 - let's look at one more
44:50 - uh wheel spin
44:55 - where's my wheel
44:59 - close and
45:04 - spin this wheel
45:11 - [Music]
45:16 - oh i was about to say and it's number 40
45:20 - but it is number 93 so let's take a look
45:23 - at this one
45:24 - pong atari version contributed by
45:28 - mark n so this is from the original okay
45:31 - let's see if you ha if you i mean i
45:33 - don't there's honor system here i
45:34 - suppose but just imagine that i made a
45:36 - coding challenge
45:38 - to make pong how long do you think it
45:41 - took me to make a very simplistic basic
45:43 - version of pawn
45:44 - i i seem to remember this one was well
45:46 - over an hour and i think it got
45:48 - light lightly edited down uh to
45:51 - hello uh about um
45:54 - uh oh no does this have ad breaks in it
45:57 - one of the things
45:58 - uh i i tried to turn that off anyway i
46:02 - i'll come back to that i have some
46:03 - issues i'm kind of like taking ads off
46:05 - many of my videos on youtube but
46:07 - i can talk more about my systems for
46:09 - doing that but um
46:10 - this one is an hour and eight minutes to
46:13 - make pong
46:14 - and then we can take a look at uh
46:17 - this pong atari version made by mark n
46:19 - let's take a look
46:21 - oh cool so i guess the atari version
46:24 - is mostly in the aesthetics although
46:27 - it's a sound
46:28 - on so maybe we're gonna get some sounds
46:29 - as well let's see
46:32 - how do i start oh yeah
46:37 - can you hear the sounds yeah i think you
46:40 - can oh
46:43 - this is so cool
46:48 - i don't remember what the key for the
46:49 - other one was i need definitely need to
46:51 - work on like a
46:52 - reinforcement learning algorithm or some
46:54 - kind of just methodology for
46:57 - the computer player this is so fun
47:02 - sorry everybody the livestream has to
47:03 - end now because i need to play this pond
47:05 - all day long afternoon great job
47:11 - i love this i especially love how the
47:14 - scores
47:15 - are made with just like uh shapes in p5
47:19 - um i would say that you but like
47:21 - probably this seems like maybe the
47:23 - default font that maybe p5
47:25 - uh had um policy gradients should work
47:28 - well says k weak mind
47:30 - um and arnov says i remember you got
47:32 - stuck with the part where you couldn't
47:33 - get the angle for the ball to bounce off
47:35 - the paddle
47:36 - yeah so first let me welcome
47:40 - joshua b oh i can't believe how many new
47:44 - members have joined one of the things i
47:45 - need to do
47:47 - is
47:51 - plug in this uh philips hue light strip
47:53 - that i have
47:55 - um which in theory i can get to blink
47:58 - where can i plug this in a lot of power
48:01 - outlets everywhere but
48:03 - um i want one one of the things on my
48:05 - list is to get this working again and
48:07 - it'll blink and
48:08 - do shiny colors when people join and
48:10 - i've got to give joshua b
48:12 - this random number oh i'm sorry their
48:13 - random number or
48:15 - i don't want to uh
48:19 - make assumptions about uh people's
48:20 - pronouns here uh 31
48:23 - 771 thank you very much
48:28 - all right so uh both xp um passes along
48:31 - a question
48:32 - from carl breckon hi daniel big fan
48:35 - thank you uh i have a big fan right over
48:38 - here
48:42 - where's my there's i do have drums here
48:44 - as my son plays the drums
48:45 - i need to have him just like the whole
48:46 - time over there doing like a
48:49 - uh what's that called when you have the
48:51 - snare it's the snare at the end of a
48:52 - joke
48:53 - um uh bro bought your book
48:57 - uh nature code is p5 an extension of
48:59 - processing or are they a lot different
49:01 - i'm primarily asking
49:02 - which i should spend my time trying to
49:04 - learn first
49:06 - um that's a great question and i get
49:08 - this is like probably one of the most
49:09 - frequently asked questions and maybe i
49:11 - should do a
49:12 - write-up or a video i'm kind of
49:15 - answering that question i do have some
49:17 - videos that um comparing p5 and
49:20 - processing
49:21 - let's try googling it this way so
49:24 - there's a few of them um and i think
49:27 - there's even another one that's not
49:29 - called this but it's
49:30 - i can't remember what it's called so
49:32 - these these are from
49:34 - three years ago or over well over three
49:36 - years ago um but they might help you
49:39 - uh think this question through a little
49:41 - bit more
49:42 - um rim shot thank you yes
49:49 - but basically what i would say is so p5
49:52 - is not an extension of processing
49:54 - so to give you the short version of this
49:57 - processing is a project and i can go to
49:59 - the processing website which is
50:00 - currently actually being redesigned
50:03 - exciting project that's happening um
50:06 - which was
50:06 - created in 2001 invented by
50:10 - casey reese and ben frye and it is a
50:12 - java based
50:14 - and i could run it right here on my
50:16 - computing machine
50:17 - and i could open up any of my examples
50:19 - and run them and it's a wonderful
50:20 - platform to use to learn programming to
50:22 - make a lot of projects with
50:24 - um p5.js is not an extension of
50:27 - processing
50:28 - the way that i um would like to the way
50:31 - that i would describe it
50:32 - is a re-imagining of processing
50:36 - for the web and actually one of the
50:37 - original goals of processing
50:39 - and principles behind it was having
50:41 - things shareable on the web but
50:43 - java applets were the way to do that um
50:45 - in 2001.
50:47 - so now javascript and canvas and just
50:49 - the
50:50 - the sort of native uh javascript api for
50:53 - the web itself is the way to do that so
50:54 - that's what
50:55 - p5 and so there's a lot of compatibility
50:58 - there's a lot of the same stuff in both
51:00 - of those but p5 also works in slightly
51:02 - different ways to be more true to
51:05 - today's age as well as the web itself so
51:08 - i don't think
51:08 - there's a way to pick which one um
51:11 - certainly the advantage of doing p5.js
51:14 - is
51:14 - um you know there's some advantages to
51:16 - learning javascript and where that's
51:18 - going to take you
51:19 - as a programmer in your journey right
51:21 - now
51:23 - and also the shareability um
51:26 - it's much it's if you're doing p5 um
51:29 - and you share your project it's easy for
51:31 - me to click on a link and just run it
51:32 - whereas if it's a processing project i
51:34 - might have to download it or copy paste
51:35 - the code and run it
51:37 - so there's sort of different situations
51:39 - for different things i could go on and
51:40 - on about this
51:41 - but um certainly my intro materials are
51:44 - a little bit more
51:45 - up to date with
51:47 - [Music]
51:48 - p5.js the beginner series i have about
51:52 - processing
51:54 - look look how there's like no look look
51:56 - at the amount i mean i guess i look kind
51:58 - of the same
51:58 - but there's just like no gray anywhere
52:02 - these were i think these are from like
52:03 - 2012. so close to 10 years ago
52:06 - oh no well it says 2015 that's the thing
52:08 - i think though a lot of these videos
52:10 - were made years earlier and i just
52:12 - uploaded them to youtube in 2015.
52:15 - so um so but i think this still um the
52:18 - quality of these videos
52:20 - is not as um high or in many ways it
52:23 - might be better
52:24 - because i'm like i think i like losing
52:26 - brain cells every year and i'm getting
52:27 - weirder
52:28 - and maybe these were like more organized
52:31 - in terms of
52:32 - uh teaching um
52:35 - last time dan played with the hue both
52:37 - xp rights last time dan played with the
52:39 - hue lights i ended up acquiring
52:40 - a hub and five lights
52:44 - i got hue lights you want to come
52:45 - sponsor me just i'm just in it for the
52:47 - sponsors these days
52:51 - all right it's almost 11. i do want to
52:53 - program something today
52:55 - um so let me move to
52:59 - making getting making an organized list
53:03 - of um
53:07 - things i want to work on this fall
53:10 - so i am going to um
53:13 - clone this github repo i have no idea
53:17 - what's working and not working
53:19 - on this computer let's update
53:23 - oh shoot we're gonna have to fix that
53:28 - um let's go to the desktop
53:33 - i don't think i have and let's let's
53:35 - grab the
53:36 - uh oh no no no i didn't want to do the
53:38 - website
53:39 - i want to do a rainbow topic
53:43 - [Music]
53:47 - you know i really should rebrand and
53:50 - change this
53:51 - github repo to be um
53:55 - like train stations or something train
53:58 - theme
53:59 - but i can't i can't i can't bring myself
54:01 - to change it from being called rainbow
54:03 - topics
54:03 - because at one time this channel was
54:05 - called coding rainbow wasn't that
54:07 - how many of you were viewers back in the
54:08 - day of coding rainbow
54:13 - get clone
54:17 - um let's go into here
54:22 - and let's open it up
54:26 - so i'm going to make a markdown file
54:30 - [Music]
54:33 - and i am going to how do i do this make
54:36 - a new file
54:39 - new file let's call this fall 2020
54:45 - coding train fall 2020.
54:48 - so here i am go my goal for this right
54:50 - now is to kind of make a list
54:53 - and a few different categories let's
54:54 - think about the categories um
54:56 - tutorials
55:00 - like i'm going to call this sequence
55:04 - tutorials for
55:06 - um you know nyu curriculum i'm just
55:09 - gonna let's get let's
55:11 - say course curriculum i want to
55:14 - do some coding challenges i would like
55:17 - to do coding in the cabana those are
55:19 - really the same
55:20 - but i don't know i do have in some ways
55:23 - like a little bit of a reason why
55:25 - some videos i think work in the coding
55:26 - cabana context
55:28 - um as well as uh
55:32 - let's call it side projects for example
55:39 - and i actually thought i might try to do
55:40 - this today
55:42 - uh i don't i'm very far away from the
55:44 - microphone now if you can still hear me
55:49 - but in this box
55:53 - i have here uh
55:57 - in this box
56:03 - uh this is
56:06 - shipped from uh all the things
56:10 - does it have a shirt in it do i get a
56:12 - t-shirt in this
56:13 - uh anyway this is an everyday calendar
56:17 - made by uh uh uh youtuber simone yertz
56:21 - and i'm i'm not i would love help with
56:23 - pronouncing um her name
56:24 - a huge fan uh
56:27 - and uh i'm excited to open this up hang
56:30 - this on the wall behind me
56:32 - um and see if i can uh program i believe
56:34 - it has an arduino in it and i can hook
56:36 - that up or even network it
56:37 - and i can start to program stuff for it
56:39 - so that's a side project that i want to
56:41 - just do on saturday live streams
56:44 - um and maybe even i kind of like
56:47 - wouldn't mind unboxing this today just
56:48 - to sort of see
56:50 - um so let's put that here
56:56 - every day calendar um i'm gonna
56:59 - mirror so what the thing that i would
57:00 - love to do is get it
57:02 - so that um i can wave my hand in front
57:05 - make it a
57:06 - danny rosen style wood mirror so if
57:08 - you're not familiar with danny rosen's
57:10 - work
57:11 - um danny rosen makes
57:14 - uh these uh wow this is like a very old
57:17 - photo
57:18 - uh makes these uh physical mirrors this
57:21 - is a mirror made out
57:22 - and uh daniel rosen also teaches at itp
57:25 - this is a physical mirror made
57:27 - out of wood blocks that turn
57:31 - and light reflects off of them so when
57:34 - they're turned up they're brighter when
57:35 - they're turned down there's a light from
57:36 - above
57:36 - and so i want to try to do something
57:38 - like that you can see all these other
57:40 - examples of of work that danny rosen has
57:42 - done so i highly encourage you to
57:44 - check that out i want to do something
57:45 - like that huge flaws in your green
57:46 - screen i know right
57:48 - um i guess i could try i i worked on
57:50 - this so much the other day and it was
57:52 - perfect
57:53 - i could try making this light brighter
57:57 - i don't know if that's going to help
58:01 - well that's going to make it worse i
58:02 - think i don't know if i made it better
58:04 - or worse
58:05 - i'm going to just go back to what it was
58:07 - there's nothing i can do about that
58:08 - today i will
58:10 - work on fixing i mean fixing my green
58:13 - screen
58:14 - uh later
58:19 - if you're going to do a factorial
58:20 - tutorial when do you think you would do
58:21 - it code fanatic i believe i have a
58:23 - factorial
58:24 - tutorial maybe somebody can find it i
58:25 - think i might have two of them
58:27 - uh it's certainly in the nature of code
58:30 - book there's a section in the nature
58:31 - code book about it okay
58:33 - so that's one side project um
58:37 - i want to continue with the hue light
58:39 - interaction
58:41 - um so that's that
58:45 - all right let's look at the courses i'm
58:48 - teaching this fall
58:50 - so one of them is introduction to
58:52 - machine learning for the arts
58:54 - um and let's so and a lot of this would
58:56 - go with
58:57 - um
59:02 - um this is not um
59:06 - this uh so a lot of this is already here
59:09 - so i want to go through this list and
59:11 - see what's missing that i need to make
59:13 - videos on
59:15 - so i have videos on transfer learning
59:17 - with teachable machine i have image
59:19 - classification
59:20 - uh pre-trained models let's go look
59:23 - at ml5js um
59:27 - uh ml5.js community stands in solidarity
59:30 - with black lives matter i'm going to
59:32 - click on this
59:33 - and go to i want to go to
59:36 - the reference
59:40 - and let's look at what some models that
59:42 - i so
59:43 - i have not made any tutorials with
59:47 - body picks u-net or face api
59:54 - so body picks
59:56 - [Music]
59:57 - u-net face api i don't think i have a
60:00 - style transfer although i do have that
60:02 - one with yaning she i do have a guest
60:04 - maybe i don't i think he'll skip style
60:06 - transfer
60:08 - um pics depicts wow there's a lot of
60:11 - stuff here
60:11 - yolo i definitely want to do uh
60:15 - put that
60:19 - um i think it's actually called in ml5
60:22 - it's called object detector
60:24 - now it's a more generic class um
60:28 - dc gan cvae i'm not so sure
60:32 - um i mean these would all be good and
60:34 - more
60:35 - let's do this i think probably
60:38 - realistically this might be where i
60:40 - stop like um
60:44 - i feel like okay so this is something i
60:46 - definitely want to do
60:47 - um this fall data collection
60:51 - model training so i have a lot on that
60:52 - but i don't think i have a video
60:54 - tutorial about
60:56 - uh model training in ml5.js
60:59 - with json or
61:02 - our csv data
61:08 - so that's something that's possible
61:11 - convolutional neural networks
61:16 - uh cnn in ml5.js tutorial
61:19 - you can try that uh runway uh so
61:23 - although i need to redo all my runway
61:25 - tutorials uh
61:27 - runway ml so i'm gonna do gpt2
61:30 - training and deployment and
61:35 - uh stylegan training
61:38 - and deployment these are the models i
61:41 - want to do
61:43 - i think there's also object detection
61:45 - and more
61:48 - so that's that um
61:53 - oh oh yeah interact somehow interactive
61:56 - image
61:58 - yeah image interactive image sense of
62:00 - this i wanted to
62:01 - interactive
62:03 - [Music]
62:05 - image synthesis so these are
62:08 - a um a list of video tutorials and so my
62:11 - plan
62:11 - is to record tutorials like this
62:14 - in this it at uh in a recording room
62:18 - that i that is at nyu i haven't been to
62:20 - the building yet but it is open again
62:21 - and i have access to it
62:23 - um so that i'll probably be doing on
62:25 - fridays
62:26 - those won't be live streamed i'm going
62:28 - to record them they'll be lightly edited
62:29 - and published
62:30 - but that is a benefit for members i
62:33 - usually will do
62:34 - a a member a live stream for coding
62:37 - terrain members which is just kind of
62:38 - like on in the background as i'm
62:40 - recording
62:41 - so it's really in some ways it's just to
62:42 - like have a little bit of a smaller
62:44 - community and get some feedback as i'm
62:46 - going
62:46 - so um so stay tuned if you're a member
62:48 - that's if i
62:49 - if if all goes according to plan that's
62:51 - the main benefit
62:53 - of joining uh coding train members to um
62:56 - is that okay
62:57 - so this is really um i should probably
63:00 - put this under machine learning
63:03 - and then uh
63:06 - i'm gonna just do like um i'm just gonna
63:09 - call this a to z so the other course
63:11 - that i'm teaching this fall
63:13 - um is and it's it's
63:16 - just about time for my short break but
63:18 - let's see if i can get through this
63:20 - um is called
63:24 - uh and program from a to z and these are
63:27 - nyu
63:28 - university courses so this is uh you
63:30 - know my day job
63:32 - but it helps me keep organized in terms
63:34 - of
63:36 - what types of content i need to work on
63:39 - um that i can then share with the
63:42 - broader
63:42 - coding trained community so looking at
63:46 - this um there are what what do i
63:50 - what do i need to do so i have stuff all
63:52 - here
63:53 - i wanted to do um this
63:56 - erasure poetry uh coding challenge
64:01 - i don't know if i'll get to that uh
64:03 - regular expressions i have a set of
64:05 - tutorials
64:06 - i think i should probably do a uh
64:09 - host sketch with p5.js
64:12 - tutorial um node with i think
64:17 - i don't know if i yeah uh
64:20 - sorry with github pages
64:22 - [Music]
64:24 - i feel like the github pages tutorials i
64:26 - have are so out of date
64:28 - and i'm always uh mentioning students to
64:31 - do that so that's something i should add
64:33 - [Music]
64:38 - um a live
64:40 - poll app is listed as a side project
64:42 - that's actually thank you
64:44 - oh yeah did i already do the cnn videos
64:47 - i think that's
64:47 - i think that's where i like left off
64:50 - i think i like didn't finish them but
64:52 - you're right
64:54 - i don't remember where i got with that
64:55 - so i'll have to look so
64:57 - um live poll application
65:00 - uh overlay yes that's definitely
65:02 - something i want to do
65:04 - that could be a sidebar that could
65:05 - actually be a step-by-step tutorial
65:07 - but probably better for that to be a
65:08 - side project um
65:13 - where where else am i uh data and apis
65:17 - so i have a bunch of data and api
65:21 - tutorials but what would be i think
65:24 - like a
65:27 - word nick coding train this is a really
65:31 - important one
65:32 - so i do have this word nick video from
65:34 - 2015
65:37 - uh i would love for somebody to if you
65:38 - want to if you want a little side
65:40 - helpful
65:40 - project to help me out and you want to
65:43 - learn word nick
65:44 - go and check out this word nick tutorial
65:46 - and let me know if it still applies
65:48 - or if you can't uh because that's like
65:50 - an important one
65:52 - uh so any new apis that might be
65:55 - interesting for me to
65:57 - show um actually one is um that i've
66:00 - been having fun with recently
66:02 - is the uh tenor gif api
66:05 - so let's do this tenor i mean gif api
66:09 - um so if you're not familiar with tenor
66:11 - i mean there's giphy the reason why i'm
66:13 - gonna mention tenor
66:15 - is just because uh tenor is doing a
66:18 - thing
66:19 - where they're creating like official
66:22 - pages for different
66:24 - content creators or youtubers so if i
66:26 - search coding train on tenor now
66:29 - um there's all these like gifs that
66:32 - i didn't make these but somebody at
66:34 - google or a tenor i'm not sure
66:36 - how that partnership works there's all
66:38 - these gifts
66:39 - so i encourage you to use them i get a
66:42 - little bit too much
66:43 - uh pleasure out of seeing myself in gift
66:46 - form i mean honestly like i don't know
66:48 - why anybody should
66:49 - use these there's but there's a page
66:51 - that has all of them
66:52 - i don't know how to get to it um
66:56 - like official coding train
67:00 - tenor gif
67:04 - uh yeah official partner there we go so
67:06 - this
67:07 - this is how you can get to all of the
67:09 - official coding train gifts
67:10 - also if you make any um
67:14 - i can include them here so that's
67:16 - something that we can discuss
67:18 - in the discord button to the discord
67:22 - where is my discord button there it is
67:24 - okay
67:25 - um tenor gif api almost to my i really
67:29 - got to take a break because i really
67:30 - have to stop at like noon
67:31 - i wonder if i can make it to 12 30 and
67:33 - not get yelled at
67:34 - um so data apis okay
67:38 - so um
67:43 - 2020 apis
67:47 - so by the way this is going to get push
67:49 - and i'll i would love
67:50 - uh suggestions so you can contribute to
67:53 - this once i uh
67:54 - once i uh put it online
67:59 - i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm just reading the
68:02 - chat
68:03 - this is kind of confusing me uh
68:10 - uh okay
68:13 - um
68:17 - uh where am i here
68:20 - okay so discord
68:24 - bot tutorial twitter bot
68:27 - reboot so one thing that i actually
68:29 - could use um help with
68:31 - um i have a full example working with
68:34 - the new
68:35 - twitter api new way that it works with
68:37 - web hooks
68:38 - and getting events and all that it's
68:40 - really exciting it took me forever to
68:41 - figure that out
68:42 - so i haven't been doing nothing this
68:45 - time that i've been live streaming so
68:46 - i've actually been
68:47 - working on figuring all of that out
68:49 - which would would have been a nice thing
68:51 - for me to do in a live stream but i just
68:53 - was not anywhere where i had any
68:55 - equipment to live stream
68:56 - but one of the things that i haven't
68:58 - been able to figure out
69:00 - which i just actually haven't gotten to
69:02 - is i want to
69:04 - move away from using
69:07 - this um
69:10 - node package uh called twit which is
69:13 - fantastic
69:14 - and it works but the other stuff that i
69:16 - have with the new web hooks i'm not
69:18 - using it
69:19 - and so it feels like weird to use both
69:21 - of these and so
69:23 - and this i'm just looking for the github
69:25 - link the reason why i unfortunately
69:27 - can't use this anymore is it's just very
69:29 - out of date
69:29 - hasn't been updated in two years twitter
69:31 - api is vastly different a lot of it
69:33 - still works
69:34 - but i want to just use fetch or i guess
69:37 - there's a new thing called axios
69:39 - [Music]
69:41 - i don't know what that is but i feel
69:43 - like i see people using
69:45 - axios now instead of fetch so maybe i
69:47 - should use axios instead
69:49 - that's a whole new set but i i finally
69:51 - made a set of tutorials on fetch last
69:53 - year so
69:53 - really do i have to re-redo it um
69:57 - so um anyway so that is
70:00 - twitter bot reboot so this is
70:04 - the new web hook stuff this is so much
70:07 - to do
70:08 - and also um deprecate
70:12 - twit uh npm package
70:16 - um
70:20 - okay so um i think i'm going to stop
70:23 - there for right now and there's lots of
70:27 - things that i need to revisit and i
70:28 - could go back to let's just go back
70:30 - briefly to this late night repo if i had
70:34 - that anywhere
70:36 - i don't know where it is i'm gonna have
70:36 - to pull it up again is it this one yeah
70:40 - i mean some of these
70:44 - some of these i should bring back
70:47 - uh yeah all right um
70:52 - oh yeah gpt2 but i'm about that i'm
70:54 - already i guess i can make a note that
70:56 - what i was going to do with the gpt 2
70:58 - training
71:00 - is
71:04 - so the idea for this one is mine
71:08 - all coding train captions and train
71:10 - model
71:12 - i guess i could just say download okay
71:16 - all right so let's move to here um
71:23 - and let's create a branch
71:34 - [Music]
71:39 - and push that up to the repo
71:43 - this is exciting i feel so excited to
71:45 - have this organized list
71:49 - uh and you know i i should model doing a
71:52 - really thoughtful pull request
71:54 - with a lot of explanation but i'm just
71:55 - going to do this because uh
71:57 - lack of time right now and here we go so
72:00 - this looks
72:01 - good i don't know why i put a little
72:03 - check mark here for this one and not any
72:05 - of the others
72:06 - um i have been using notion as a sponsor
72:10 - of the coding train i have been using
72:11 - notion
72:12 - to keep a lot of things organized and
72:13 - it's possible it might make sense
72:15 - to use notion as an idea tracking and
72:17 - suggestion system
72:19 - but i guess i'm going to keep this for
72:21 - right now i'm going to merge this
72:22 - in and i would encourage you those of
72:26 - you watching right now
72:28 - to
72:32 - to contribute to this so if you have
72:35 - useful
72:36 - references if you have a way of thinking
72:37 - about how you might want to organize
72:39 - this differently if you want to like add
72:41 - all the check boxes that i forgot to add
72:43 - um you could file an issue or
72:46 - a pull request and um i will try to keep
72:49 - an eye
72:50 - and violet i should see as watching um
72:53 - can be a point person for this as well
72:55 - to keep an eye on helping um keep this
72:57 - list organized
72:58 - and probably next friday is when i'm
73:01 - gonna start
73:02 - so i don't know what i'm going to do
73:04 - like start going through this list
73:06 - bouncing back and forth between machine
73:07 - learning and a to z
73:09 - and then the side projects will be on
73:11 - the weekends
73:12 - when i do live streams hopefully
73:14 - saturday mornings so fridays and
73:16 - saturdays are my coding train days for
73:18 - this fall
73:21 - axios is a version of node fetch not
73:23 - fetch
73:24 - much as many features much more than
73:26 - that is also not new anymore
73:28 - it's new to me right
73:32 - hello amy a new member amy
73:35 - welcome i have been live for since 10
73:38 - a.m
73:39 - and uh let's
73:45 - i'm gonna take a break in a minute but
73:48 - before i take a break
73:49 - i want to thank the sponsor of today's
73:52 - [Music]
73:54 - brilliant and
73:58 - because i'm very tired all of a sudden
74:01 - and i'm starting to feel like i can't
74:03 - think straight see
74:05 - straight think clearly i'm gonna add a
74:08 - little coffee to my
74:12 - mug
74:14 - this is my technivorm
74:18 - mocha master i think this is is this
74:22 - dutch maybe i don't know scandinavian
74:25 - i'm not sure somebody will tell me why
74:28 - i've lost so many viewers
74:30 - [Music]
74:38 - you know what you go on the side project
74:39 - is the rubik's cube stuff
74:41 - protectorate well that could be a coding
74:43 - [Music]
74:49 - okay
74:50 - [Music]
74:54 - so what could possibly be better
74:57 - than a mug that has
75:01 - mathematical formulas on it come on
75:03 - focus
75:04 - right uh what could possibly be better
75:06 - than that well i have something to tell
75:08 - you
75:09 - that could be better and it is
75:11 - [Music]
75:15 - brilliant it is it's not only brilliant
75:18 - it is brilliant
75:20 - um so oops i pressed the wrong button
75:24 - um so
75:27 - uh do you want to learn something new
75:29 - brilliant is the place
75:30 - to do it brilliant is a website an app
75:33 - that makes learning accessible and fun
75:34 - their approach is based on problem
75:36 - solving and active learning it's about
75:38 - seeing concepts visually and interacting
75:40 - with them and then
75:41 - answering questions that get you to
75:42 - think their courses are laid out like a
75:45 - story and broken down
75:46 - into pieces so that you can tackle them
75:48 - a little bit at a time
75:49 - there are no tests no grades just pick a
75:52 - course based on what you're interested
75:53 - in and get started
75:54 - if you make a mistake no big deal check
75:56 - out the explanations to find out more
75:58 - you can learn on your own pace there's
75:59 - something for everybody basics of
76:01 - algebra learn programming i learn about
76:03 - cutting edge topics like
76:07 - [Music]
76:09 - neural networks so that's what i uh the
76:12 - the sort of
76:12 - uh uh what i captured for you off the
76:15 - of the website that i wanted to show you
76:17 - is i have a whole set of video tutorials
76:19 - on neural networks
76:20 - and a wonderful companion piece to that
76:22 - is the brilliant course
76:23 - uh neural networks um that you can and
76:25 - what i love about it is it's different
76:26 - than watching a video that's just stuff
76:28 - that you can interact with
76:29 - um and play with um so
76:32 - one of the things that's really um
76:34 - exciting to me that i just learned
76:36 - recently
76:37 - is that brilliant has a new course
76:41 - and um the new course is about
76:44 - uh infinity so reckoning with infinity
76:47 - is a
76:48 - major like it's just a it's a big topic
76:51 - to tackle in your brain
76:52 - hard to do and so uh the course starts
76:56 - with basic counting and and if you if
76:58 - you go through and you'll work your way
76:59 - up to
76:59 - many different types of infinity
77:01 - culminating in the profundity of
77:03 - cantor's theorem
77:04 - explore the stunning beauty of fractals
77:06 - uh tessellations in hyperbolic space
77:09 - so many things so one of the things that
77:10 - i particularly love about
77:13 - brilliant is that i i really use it
77:16 - um as a mechanism for coming up with
77:18 - ideas for things that i want to try to
77:20 - program in p5.js
77:22 - um let me just go to the website really
77:24 - briefly
77:25 - um i'm generally trying these daily
77:28 - challenges
77:29 - i hear footsteps children children you
77:32 - should be on brilliant.org
77:34 - learning some math and science right now
77:39 - what uh i'll tell you more about it
77:43 - later
77:44 - um so but i want to just check out um
77:47 - the new infinity course just like
77:49 - briefly together um let's see if i can
77:51 - find it here
77:52 - um so so just to be clear you can um
77:56 - you can sign up for free and do the
77:57 - daily challenges and a lot of
77:59 - free stuff and there's an app as well um
78:01 - but if you go to brilliant.org
78:03 - coding train um you can get a 20 off
78:06 - discount
78:06 - uh the first 200 people who use that
78:08 - link at least for the premium
78:10 - subscription which unlocks everything
78:12 - um all of the courses and everything so
78:14 - let's see let's
78:15 - continue course i i just clicked on it
78:17 - this morning but i didn't do go very far
78:20 - so you can see here let's let's go
78:22 - through a little bit of it together
78:23 - um just for a couple minutes and then
78:25 - i'll give you some time if you want to
78:27 - like
78:27 - check it out yourself and i'll take a
78:28 - short break let me move the banner out
78:30 - of the way okay
78:32 - so in this course you'll learn what
78:33 - infinity is how it's used in mathematics
78:36 - and why it's indispensable everywhere
78:38 - from the fundamentals of euclidean
78:40 - geometry and algebra okay uh all right
78:43 - which of these is infinite the number of
78:46 - fish in the sea
78:47 - no right that's a discrete amount i mean
78:50 - we i don't know what it is like we could
78:52 - we could go through an exercise and try
78:53 - to estimate the number of positive
78:55 - integers
78:56 - yes the number of grains of sand and all
78:58 - the beaches on earth
78:59 - no that's also we could estimate that
79:02 - the number of possible combinations that
79:04 - a standard
79:05 - circular combination lock can have that
79:07 - is not infinite that's a very large
79:09 - number so
79:10 - let's let's see if i get this right
79:11 - correct oh
79:14 - that's good i got that one right okay uh
79:18 - the major distinction between finite and
79:20 - infinite is a bit more
79:21 - slippery than just saying they're
79:22 - infinitely many whole numbers because
79:24 - you could count them forever
79:26 - please don't try this proof technically
79:27 - at home we don't have forever to spend
79:29 - counting oh
79:30 - oh i take that as a personal challenge
79:34 - next live stream counting all
79:38 - of the infinite number of whole numbers
79:43 - if you're asked to prove that there are
79:45 - infinitely many whole numbers
79:47 - i was hoping i would get to the thing
79:49 - that's in the video here like
79:51 - in the video here i wanted to do this
79:52 - one there's like about infinite areas
79:54 - and things maybe this will pop up here
79:56 - because i mean i thought i'm in quiz one
79:57 - but we'll see
79:59 - um not even entire life spent counting
80:03 - counts as proof however here's a logical
80:05 - argument that takes only a few minutes
80:07 - to say
80:08 - if there were finitely many whole
80:10 - numbers there would be a largest whole
80:12 - number
80:12 - there is no largest whole number because
80:14 - for any positive whole number
80:16 - x what is also a whole number and is
80:20 - uh larger than x x plus one
80:23 - oh all of the above i was going to say i
80:26 - would use oh my god
80:28 - i'm not in the right place um i would
80:32 - use x plus one but i suppose all of the
80:34 - above is true
80:35 - so i'm going to do that correct all
80:37 - right
80:39 - i'm going to get one wrong soon enough
80:42 - i have not done this before i have no i
80:44 - have some sometimes i'll do the
80:45 - brilliant thing and i like looked at it
80:47 - earlier
80:47 - i have not looked at this at all so the
80:50 - continuity of lines and geometry and
80:51 - calculus motivates another flavor of
80:53 - infinity
80:54 - on a line or line segment any two points
80:56 - that have not any non-zero distance
80:58 - between them have
80:58 - infinitely many points between them yes
81:02 - for example there's always a point
81:03 - halfway between any two points
81:05 - as we'll discuss later in this course
81:06 - this also corresponds to the fact that
81:08 - there is always a decimal value
81:10 - that's exactly halfway between any pair
81:12 - of different decimal values okay
81:14 - if the two positions x and z are on the
81:16 - line above are at a distance of
81:18 - 0.101 apart if y is exactly halfway
81:22 - what is the distance between x and y oh
81:25 - this
81:25 - requires me to do some like hard math
81:30 - x and z are 0.101
81:34 - y is half so wouldn't it just be half of
81:37 - 1
81:38 - 0 1 which is .05
81:45 - 05 right i think it's this one
81:50 - okay you got that right i was like
81:52 - afraid that like i was like
81:54 - is this a trick question there must be
81:56 - something going on here
81:58 - um geometry has a lot of inherent
82:02 - infinities that are built into the
82:03 - nature of common
82:04 - geometric objects even empty geometric
82:07 - space is an infinitive of
82:08 - sorts like for example there's an
82:10 - infinite number of points
82:12 - inside of um
82:15 - of a circle but it depends how you you
82:17 - measure those points i suppose
82:22 - oh i just i said some weird stuff there
82:24 - that didn't necessarily make sense
82:27 - and edit that part out but there's oh
82:29 - i'm live okay sorry
82:31 - even empty geometric space uh okay it's
82:33 - not which of these is a finite quantity
82:36 - the length of a line y equals mx plus b
82:39 - on the coordinate plane no that's not
82:42 - finite if the line goes
82:46 - uh to through in the infinity of
82:49 - two-dimensional space
82:50 - the area of a circle with a radius one
82:52 - this is finite
82:55 - the number of different cartesian
82:57 - coordinates in 3d space
83:00 - that is infinite and so i'm gonna
83:03 - hit submit
83:06 - correct oh it's very it's big makes me
83:10 - feel so good
83:12 - okay oh my goodness the perimeter of
83:14 - this regular polygon increases every
83:16 - time the number of sides and
83:18 - increases therefore eventually the
83:20 - length of the polygon's perimeter will
83:21 - be larger than the circumference
83:23 - of the gray circle surrounding it
83:26 - no no no
83:30 - it will be this it will it approaches
83:32 - the circumference of the circle
83:34 - so there is a way to create an
83:36 - infinitely long curve
83:37 - the coke curve i believe koch
83:41 - i think that's probably going to come up
83:42 - here that's one i think i have a
83:44 - coding challenge
83:49 - that goes through the coke fractal
83:51 - snowflake and fractal recursion with an
83:53 - arraylist of objects
83:55 - um but this should be false okay
83:59 - got that one right i do have a buzzer
84:02 - sound effect by the way for when i get
84:04 - it wrong
84:05 - that hasn't happened yet all right right
84:07 - we're about to do the coke
84:08 - snowflake here
84:14 - um
84:16 - okay in the animation above pink dots or
84:18 - marks or those
84:19 - so i i'm gonna uh speed through this
84:21 - because i'm very familiar with this
84:23 - particular fractal pattern
84:24 - and i encourage you to check out my
84:26 - video on it or come back to this if we
84:27 - suppose the initial triangle is the area
84:29 - of one square unit is the falling claim
84:31 - true or false
84:32 - you know how many times the steps
84:34 - described above are carried out the
84:35 - total area of the snowflake will never
84:37 - exceed
84:38 - two square units oh boy i don't believe
84:41 - the area
84:42 - is infinite the length of the curve is
84:45 - infinite
84:46 - but i believe the area would be
84:50 - approaches a finite number the question
84:53 - is i don't know what that number would
84:55 - be or how to calculate it and i
84:56 - definitely don't have the time to work
84:58 - that out right now
84:58 - so i'm going to just use my intuition
85:06 - um yeah i guess i'm not saying it right
85:10 - everybody is like making fun of the way
85:12 - that i said i like to say koch curve
85:14 - that's how i always have said it but i
85:15 - believe that's
85:16 - the completely incorrect pronunciation
85:20 - okay
85:25 - um the total error will never exceed two
85:29 - square units how much was the single
85:30 - triangle
85:36 - so we could actually figure this out
85:38 - because um
85:40 - hold on let's do a little bit of work
85:43 - figuring this out
85:49 - this is one square unit
85:53 - so this
85:59 - is this is how much one two three four
86:02 - five six seven eight nine
86:04 - this is one ninth
86:07 - so when we do it once
86:12 - we're saying one plus one third because
86:14 - there's three of those
86:17 - so we go from one to one plus one third
86:20 - which is four-thirds
86:25 - then we're going to say four-thirds plus
86:30 - one-third of four-thirds
86:34 - that ninths
86:35 - [Music]
86:39 - there's a formula for this right because
86:42 - if this whole thing oh no no
86:43 - no no the new area we're adding
86:46 - is is uh
86:51 - is one-third of one-ninth
86:54 - which is 1 27
86:57 - but then we get 2 1 2
87:01 - 3 4 5 6 of them
87:04 - oh do i do it everywhere
87:08 - yeah so we get one two three four five
87:12 - six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
87:16 - thirteen oh i'm so confused
87:19 - it's got to be like something to the n
87:21 - power
87:23 - did anybody solve this for me in the
87:25 - chat it could just
87:27 - i'm going to say that intuition wise if
87:30 - this is like
87:31 - four thirds and then we're adding a
87:33 - little i don't think we're gonna get
87:34 - above two
87:36 - so like just by without working out the
87:38 - exact amount here
87:40 - one-ninth of one-ninth yeah one-ninth of
87:43 - one-ninth i'm
87:43 - sorry that was this is ninth of one yeah
87:46 - yeah okay
87:47 - i don't think we're gonna get above two
87:49 - so what was the question again
87:51 - um never exceed two units
87:55 - true correct
88:00 - thank you there's no exact way to
88:02 - calculate it
88:03 - 12 not 13. thank you chris
88:06 - um in this quiz you saw some examples of
88:10 - infinity algebra geometry and a quick
88:12 - proof that are infinitely many numbers
88:13 - we
88:14 - were comparing in the next quiz we'll
88:15 - get to the real the essence infinity we
88:17 - need to find a way to measure and
88:18 - compare different infinities to each
88:19 - other
88:22 - for example is there any sense where the
88:24 - numbers of integers is
88:25 - larger than the number of positive
88:27 - integers are they
88:28 - in reality the same infinity
88:33 - i have done eight percent i love this
88:36 - quiz
88:38 - and i'm going to continue and how to
88:41 - this is the one that i wanted to do
88:43 - so this visualizing infinity one that's
88:45 - the one that i was hoping to do
88:46 - maybe i'll i'll just do it on my own
88:48 - later but um
88:51 - each iteration the area is multiplied by
88:54 - four
88:54 - thirds um
88:58 - no wait i'm wrong
88:59 - [Laughter]
89:01 - these are fun problems to work out and
89:03 - fun problems to make uh
89:04 - interactive sketches to try to explain
89:07 - but um
89:08 - so i'm gonna take a break now um if you
89:10 - are interested
89:12 - in brilliant and you wanna uh another
89:13 - way that you can support
89:15 - um the coding train channel is to go and
89:18 - sign up even for a free account just to
89:19 - brilliant.org slash coding train
89:21 - um and certainly if you use that url um
89:24 - and you choose to either purchase a
89:26 - premium subscription for yourself or
89:28 - gift one to somebody else
89:29 - um you will get uh 20 off discount
89:32 - through that url
89:33 - so um thanks i'm gonna take out just to
89:34 - like only have like a half an hour left
89:36 - unless i can squeeze in a little
89:38 - extra time before my kids kick me out of
89:40 - the attic this is their playroom
89:43 - uh then i'll come back and maybe i'll
89:45 - try to just code up a little something
89:47 - we'll get started maybe i'll unbox
89:49 - this everyday calendar i don't know i
89:51 - look forward to hearing from you i'll be
89:52 - back in about
89:52 - less than five minutes okay
90:05 - [Music]
90:32 - dog
90:36 - [Music]
90:41 - [Music]
91:00 - so
91:03 - [Music]
91:42 - do
91:43 - [Music]
92:08 - [Applause]
92:09 - [Music]
94:02 - do
94:05 - [Music]
94:59 - all right i am coming back in just about
95:03 - 20 seconds
95:15 - i think i want to work on the live poll
95:17 - thing that's what i'm sort of thinking
95:20 - um so first of all simon reminded me
95:23 - on i guess i closed this out already
95:26 - that um
95:27 - if you go to the unbrilliant if you go
95:29 - to the show explanation i would have
95:30 - seen an explanation of the formula and
95:32 - how to calculate the
95:34 - uh area of the um
95:38 - snowflake fractal that's what i'm just
95:39 - going to call it from now the snowflake
95:41 - fractal so i encourage you to
95:42 - go out and check that so um
95:45 - so i have about a half an hour i mean
95:47 - i'll keep going as long as um
95:50 - no one kicks me out but i did promise my
95:52 - children it is saturday
95:54 - i think i'd worked out a way that i can
95:56 - stream every saturday and it doesn't
95:58 - it's not too big of an imposition on
96:00 - family
96:00 - um as long um for the time being at
96:02 - least but um i do need to do stuff with
96:04 - my kids the rest of the weekend my
96:06 - daughter
96:07 - just learned to ride a bike which was
96:08 - like a super fun and thrilling exciting
96:11 - thing
96:11 - um to happen i definitely want to take
96:13 - her for a bike ride today
96:15 - um i also got to do some work preparing
96:17 - for my classes on monday but so
96:19 - hopefully this system's going to work
96:21 - friday's recording sessions at nyu for
96:25 - sequence tutorials
96:27 - saturdays live streams with messing
96:29 - around and working on these side
96:30 - projects
96:31 - so i think i would like to start i think
96:34 - i think i want to start one of these two
96:36 - side projects in which i won't get
96:38 - too far simon has suggested to use a
96:40 - straw ball this is why i should do the
96:42 - poll
96:42 - application because that way i want to
96:45 - have a run a poll
96:46 - and i want to see the live results as an
96:48 - overlay
96:50 - so i guess i could do a poll um
96:55 - but uh i could also just unbox the
96:57 - everyday calendar and try to like plug
96:58 - it in and
96:59 - i uh so let's see let's see what what
97:02 - people think
97:03 - uh simon's telling me to do a straw poll
97:07 - i always try there's two straw poll
97:08 - sites one straw poll dot com and one
97:11 - straw poll dot me
97:12 - i think i need to do a poll to determine
97:14 - which straw poll site i should work use
97:17 - i could also just work on solving a
97:19 - rubik's cube
97:21 - um
97:24 - [Music]
97:30 - all right let's let's go for it let's do
97:31 - the straw poll
97:33 - i don't know which one somebody tell me
97:35 - which one to use
97:37 - i'd love to see some coding i think i
97:39 - should try to work on the the live poll
97:41 - app
97:42 - because as much it'll be interesting to
97:43 - unbox the everyday calendar i don't know
97:45 - how exciting that would be for people to
97:46 - watch
97:47 - and i could just do that on my own time
97:49 - and mount it over here and then
97:51 - actually um you know do a live stream
97:54 - where i'm
97:55 - coding it as opposed to unboxing a
97:56 - rubik's cube
97:58 - uh joshua b says today is a great day
98:00 - for a bike ride
98:01 - indeed um agreed
98:04 - um all right
98:07 - um let's work let's let's get started
98:10 - with a coding train
98:12 - straw poll dot me is more but all right
98:15 - we'll try the
98:16 - waste a little more time by doing a poll
98:19 - uh start
98:23 - pull overlay project
98:26 - and then um unbox
98:31 - every day calendar oh
98:34 - [Music]
98:36 - 20 minutes of coding train
98:40 - probably uh i don't know sure improve i
98:43 - don't know
98:44 - great poll okay
98:47 - here's the poll everybody somebody put
98:50 - this into
98:51 - the chat live polls don't get up pages
98:54 - yeah
98:54 - uh i'm curious to say i'm not
98:56 - necessarily you
98:58 - i have a of a a reputation for doing the
99:00 - opposite of whatever people vote on
99:04 - um but uh i would love i'd love to just
99:07 - get to get the get a sense
99:09 - has anybody posted it yet in the chat
99:11 - you guys are like at least 30 seconds
99:12 - behind me
99:13 - um and i did it on i guess i could post
99:15 - it be the one to post it
99:20 - try to avoid showing your address did i
99:22 - show my address already
99:23 - i i meant to avoid that did that happen
99:26 - when i was looking at the box
99:28 - um i probably should have not said that
99:32 - okay straw poll dot me okay hold on that
99:34 - didn't show up as a link for some reason
99:36 - solar liner there you go thank you
99:38 - okay so i'm gonna vote for this
99:42 - and uh here are the results so far
99:46 - does this live update oh it does well
99:49 - this is fun
99:56 - you know what's sort of silly is i i
99:58 - don't necessarily need to make my own
100:00 - one of these as an overlay
100:02 - because i could just i would rather i
100:05 - like to have my own
100:08 - [Music]
100:13 - i don't know this is pretty um pretty
100:16 - clear i think
100:35 - i'm going to let it get to a huh well i
100:36 - guess even if it got to 100 even if all
100:38 - 15
100:39 - were for um
100:43 - the unboxing it wouldn't make it all
100:44 - right let's get started here everybody
100:47 - um let's get started with this project
100:51 - let's first um
100:56 - create a repo let's call this
100:59 - a live poll
101:05 - um and let's do this add a remi file
101:10 - um and create the repo
101:14 - um generally these days i
101:18 - prefer to use um
101:24 - whoops
101:28 - just the term main as my
101:31 - main branch so i'm just going to quickly
101:34 - change that here as the default branch
101:42 - and i'm going to go back here to
101:46 - branches and get delete this branch
101:50 - um okay so now let's
101:56 - um
101:57 - [Music]
101:59 - clone this repo
102:02 - and
102:05 - [Music]
102:07 - whoops
102:11 - [Music]
102:12 - um
102:17 - okay so there's
102:24 - um okay so
102:29 - uh let's see
102:33 - so what i'm going to start with and
102:36 - so a couple things i should mention i'm
102:38 - embarking on a little side project
102:40 - adventure here where i'm making
102:42 - an actual web application
102:45 - i am not exactly the person that you
102:48 - should model your own
102:50 - web development practice off of i
102:53 - sort of just tinker whip up projects
102:56 - take shortcuts
102:57 - don't necessarily pay the most attention
102:59 - to certain security things
103:01 - so um i'll try to address those kind of
103:04 - questions and concerns as i go
103:06 - but um there's certainly you know i'm
103:08 - always referring to the coding garden
103:09 - but there's a lot of other channels that
103:11 - really do much deeper dives into
103:13 - frameworks and different
103:14 - sort of systems for more robust web
103:17 - application development but just to try
103:18 - to
103:19 - teach the basics of getting this going
103:21 - here i know that this is going to need
103:23 - to be a node
103:24 - application it needs to be a node
103:27 - application because i need to have some
103:29 - server that's keeping track of
103:30 - everybody's votes
103:32 - so if i were just and potentially i
103:34 - could make use of like a server list
103:37 - something or some type of
103:40 - other like database as a service thing
103:42 - but uh with but i'm gonna write my own
103:44 - uh node code so i know that i want to uh
103:48 - start with npm init npm init
103:52 - uh first of all if you want if you're
103:54 - following along here and i'm jumping
103:55 - into the middle of a project assuming a
103:57 - lot of like
103:58 - uh existing um knowledge of javascript
104:01 - but
104:02 - um if if you want to just try to follow
104:05 - along the things you're
104:06 - going to want to make sure you have are
104:08 - downloaded
104:09 - node onto your computer so that
104:12 - that you can type in node and you want
104:14 - to have some
104:15 - shell access to your machine whether
104:17 - you're on windows or mac or linux
104:19 - and i guess i suppose if you're looking
104:23 - for
104:23 - a bit more on this this is my 2018
104:27 - workflow series which is
104:28 - largely unchanged we're using visual
104:31 - studio code some shell access
104:33 - get a node so you can lose that
104:36 - uh don't use integers for ids
104:40 - use npm init dash y i don't know what
104:42 - the dash y does
104:44 - simon is suggesting that i use dash y so
104:47 - i'm going to go ahead
104:48 - and do that webrtc for browser browser
104:53 - communication or potentially web sockets
104:55 - yeah there might be um
104:59 - there might be an aspect of this that's
105:01 - uh meaningful to use websockets so
105:04 - um okay so here we go
105:07 - i don't know what dash y does what did
105:10 - dash y do
105:11 - just filled out all that stuff without
105:13 - asking me the questions
105:16 - okay i don't know what dash why did oh
105:18 - and maybe i should
105:20 - uh up update my npm
105:26 - and i'll just run that real quickly
105:30 - oh you've got to be kidding me did i not
105:33 - fix this thing
105:34 - oh i'm the worst i'm the worst so one
105:37 - thing i really like to do so
105:39 - one of the reasons why i'm getting
105:40 - tripped up here is that i
105:42 - use a separate login to this laptop to
105:45 - live stream
105:46 - so this is the main laptop i use for
105:48 - work you can sort of i can lift it up
105:49 - here you can see it with all my
105:51 - stickers and if you're a coding trained
105:52 - member you will get some of these
105:53 - stickers
105:54 - in the mail much more quickly than
105:56 - anybody ever has in the past
105:58 - because i've got a system for that now
105:59 - um but
106:01 - um so i haven't actually spent the time
106:05 - to configure a lot of settings
106:06 - on um this particular login
106:10 - so i'm gonna fix this now this is the
106:11 - time to do all this stuff that it takes
106:13 - time
106:14 - uh just sort of like this is uh in many
106:16 - ways what people are here for in terms
106:18 - of like watching somebody code
106:20 - and talk about it but also this is like
106:23 - the boring stuff
106:24 - um so i uh mpm permissions there's i
106:28 - um you can find i know there's a page if
106:30 - i google this this is exactly what i'm
106:32 - looking for
106:33 - um so basically node
106:36 - will install and configure modules
106:40 - which i don't know why that happened but
106:42 - i want to make sure this is weird there
106:44 - might have been a different error
106:45 - message
106:46 - um this is interesting auto fills the
106:49 - answers with default is what dash y does
106:51 - anyway one of the things you can do with
106:53 - node
106:54 - is install global packages
106:57 - meaning essentially things that you can
106:59 - just install into your computer that run
107:01 - via node
107:02 - that are utilities and tools that you
107:04 - can run from the command line
107:06 - and i always like to make sure those are
107:08 - in a folder
107:09 - um that has the right permissions and
107:11 - that has access to
107:13 - by um that's not globally across all
107:16 - users logged into a machine but
107:17 - so that's what this is doing here so i
107:19 - actually want to make sure i do this i'm
107:21 - going to make a directory
107:22 - that is tilde is just my home directory
107:25 - which is
107:27 - you can see user slash coding train
107:30 - that's what tilde is i want to make sure
107:31 - i make that
107:32 - global directory i want to set the
107:35 - prefix
107:36 - um for global packages to that
107:40 - i don't know why again i'm still not
107:42 - sure why and then i've got to add that
107:44 - to my path
107:46 - um so um
107:50 - things go there as well as ah so i
107:53 - am using as my shell
107:56 - or bash no i'm not using bash
107:59 - so the configuration information is in a
108:02 - file called
108:06 - um
108:09 - dot z shrc because i am using something
108:13 - called zsh
108:16 - which is the z shell uh it is designed
108:19 - for interactive use powerful scripting
108:21 - language blah blah blah blah blah blah
108:22 - blah
108:23 - i don't i address this a little bit in a
108:25 - video and so i think if i say
108:27 - source that that's me following these
108:30 - instructions instead of dot profile
108:34 - i'm getting this error
108:38 - i know crap i know how to fix this error
108:41 - i don't know how
108:42 - far far into the weeds i want to get
108:44 - with this
108:46 - but uh let's see if this if that at
108:48 - least
108:52 - did this yeah so that works now
108:55 - that was weird was that
109:00 - okay so i should be updated now
109:03 - and if i look at this i've got my
109:07 - package.json so
109:08 - all i've got so far boy this is this
109:10 - side project's going to take a while
109:11 - but all i've got so far is a
109:14 - um
109:18 - um all i've got so far is just the
109:21 - package.json
109:22 - so i i want to run a web server
109:25 - so i'm going to make a new file i will
109:28 - call it
109:29 - index.js and
109:33 - i'm going to just pull from my
109:36 - working with data
109:40 - and apis examples which has some
109:43 - boilerplate stuff
109:45 - in it intro to data apis and js
109:49 - maybe module two i made a web app that
109:51 - was the data selfie app
109:53 - so i think this will have
109:57 - kind of the boilerplate stuff that i
109:58 - want so i'm going to grab this
110:03 - i know i might want a database but i'm
110:05 - actually not going to worry about that
110:06 - right now
110:08 - and just make sure i have an app that
110:10 - listens and that
110:11 - it serves some static files
110:15 - so because i'm using express which is a
110:17 - very lightweight framework for
110:18 - creating web servers i need to
110:22 - npm install i think you can just say
110:24 - mbmi
110:26 - for short express
110:30 - so that's not installing a global
110:31 - package but a local package
110:34 - which is now as part of my project here
110:36 - under dependencies
110:38 - um and
110:40 - [Music]
110:41 - simon is suggesting i changed this to
110:42 - mit that sounds fine with me
110:45 - [Music]
110:47 - and is this the place where i would do
110:49 - something like if i wanted to say npm
110:50 - start
110:51 - and have it do like node index.js is
110:54 - that how i do that
110:55 - so if i want to say npm start
110:58 - or does it already know to do that
111:00 - because main is up here is index.js i
111:02 - don't know
111:02 - npm start right so i'm running npm start
111:07 - now the server's listening at 3000 port
111:09 - 3000.
111:10 - so if i were to create now
111:13 - a directory called public and put in it
111:17 - a file called index.html
111:21 - and just say how do you do that isn't
111:24 - there a thing
111:25 - [Music]
111:26 - there's a thing in visual studio code
111:29 - where i type a set of commands
111:31 - and it just like
111:34 - it out spits out like boilerplate html
111:37 - does anybody know how to do that
111:45 - i'll just write uh hello world
111:49 - uh exclamation point tab
111:53 - exclamation tab there we go thank you
111:57 - cj for the win here um
112:01 - so we're going to call this a live
112:04 - coding train poll and
112:05 - i should think eventually uh this is a a
112:08 - definitely
112:09 - a um
112:12 - if i go to the live poll app
112:19 - issues
112:23 - train themed with hearts
112:26 - and rainbows everything
112:30 - should be train themed
112:33 - with hearts and rainbows so
112:37 - this is a uh help wanted
112:40 - this is a way you can contribute by
112:42 - helping me with the
112:44 - land the language and designs of this
112:46 - poll application
112:48 - [Music]
112:53 - so let's see now if i go to localhost
112:58 - 3000 we can see here
113:01 - you know we've set up this web
113:03 - application so i'm getting somewhere
113:05 - with this project
113:10 - um
113:13 - okay i'm getting something with it's
113:15 - coding trainbow yes
113:17 - i'm getting somewhere with this project
113:18 - awesome so i think i will include p5
113:22 - because while all of this could be done
113:24 - with native javascript and dom
113:28 - i think i'll use a canvas to in real
113:30 - time draw
113:31 - the equivalent of people's voting
113:35 - so i want to make sure that i
113:38 - include the p5 library and a
113:41 - quick little cheat that i have here is i
113:44 - can get
113:45 - the cdn and there might even i might
113:48 - even want to have sound but i'm just
113:49 - going to use
113:50 - the p5 library here by adding this
113:52 - script tag
113:53 - uh to here
113:56 - where did that go just uh just under
113:58 - head i can add a script tag does it go
114:01 - where like here it's i mean i don't know
114:03 - that it matters
114:04 - but here it's first above like the meta
114:06 - stuff so i don't know it
114:07 - feels like wrong like i feel like it
114:09 - should be here
114:11 - or below the title i don't actually know
114:13 - where should it be
114:15 - is there a correct answer to this
114:16 - question i don't think so
114:19 - uh okay so i'm gonna put that there
114:22 - and uh i'm also then going to
114:26 - create a
114:29 - new file i'll call it sketch.js for p5
114:33 - um and
114:37 - um what was i looking for let's go back
114:40 - to
114:40 - here and just grab this i mean i could
114:42 - have figured out how to type that
114:44 - we're going to put this at the bottom of
114:46 - the body
114:48 - sketch.js and so now if i go
114:51 - here and create function setup
114:56 - uh function draw
115:00 - and i'm going to say create
115:04 - canvas uh 400 by 300
115:09 - i'm going to use clear because i want it
115:12 - to be
115:13 - oh why is my all of my auto format
115:16 - everything
115:17 - so much i have to configure on this i
115:18 - really i'm gonna need to do that
115:20 - on a live stream just like set up my dev
115:23 - environment
115:27 - it's like i have all this set up on my
115:29 - main log into the computer now because i
115:30 - use it all the time
115:32 - um
115:36 - two two two okay um i want to show
115:40 - i'll deal with this later um where are
115:42 - my
115:43 - kleenex i bought kleenex with me anyway
115:45 - um
115:47 - clear uh let's draw a rectangle
115:51 - i'm gonna change the autocomplete stuff
115:53 - uh 10
115:55 - uh with uh i'm gonna do it at 10
115:59 - 10 with some width and 20 so i just want
116:02 - to
116:03 - uh
116:07 - do something very silly right now
116:11 - uh which is
116:14 - map the sine of an angle which goes
116:17 - between negative 1 and 1
116:18 - to between 0 and 300
116:22 - and let's say fill
116:26 - 255 0 100. i just want to see
116:29 - a rectangle growing and shrinking
116:37 - oh and then let's have the angle
116:40 - increase
116:42 - buy some amount okay so
116:47 - oh i'm not doing this in the p5 web
116:48 - editor i didn't need to host this
116:52 - oh how i wanted to experiment with ngrok
116:56 - because that's something um
117:00 - that i need in the uh rainbow topics
117:05 - i only have five minutes left but i'm
117:07 - gonna go until i get kicked out
117:10 - uh fall 2020.
117:13 - so here because so twitter
117:16 - um
117:20 - so to run uh a twitter bot
117:23 - um when i go and finally do that new
117:25 - sequence tutorials
117:27 - you need to run a a web server that has
117:31 - a publicly accessible url
117:33 - so one way to do that is with glitch
117:34 - that's how i in my experiments this
117:36 - summer glitch
117:37 - is a uh
117:40 - an online web editor that i like to use
117:43 - um
117:44 - has lots of wonderful features that you
117:45 - can run node
117:47 - for me to be able to get that to work
117:48 - though i had to purchase a premium
117:50 - account
117:51 - because otherwise the glitch apps if you
117:52 - don't have a premium account go to sleep
117:54 - and if i have a twitter bot this is
117:55 - running in the background i need for it
117:57 - not to go to sleep
117:59 - but i believe a way that i can very
118:02 - quickly spin up a publicly accessible
118:04 - url for a web hook
118:05 - just from like any computer anywhere on
118:07 - the internet is with something called
118:09 - ngrok is that true i have never used
118:12 - ngrok
118:12 - and i believe there's some node packages
118:14 - that use it very easily
118:16 - so that's kind of um one thing i want to
118:18 - do the reason why i might use it now
118:21 - is because i want to open it as a
118:23 - browser i want to see it as an overlay
118:25 - on the live stream
118:27 - so is that something that i could make
118:30 - happen really quickly without like
118:32 - causing a major security issue
118:35 - i'm looking to the chat i prefer it
118:38 - below the title as well
118:39 - some html parsers like to see the meta
118:41 - tags at the top
118:42 - oh with ngroku limited to 40 connections
118:45 - per minute
118:46 - so websocket connection could be quickly
118:48 - saturated with all the live stream
118:49 - viewers
118:50 - all right so i could so here's a
118:52 - question i have what is a way that i can
118:55 - deploy
118:55 - a one thing i haven't figured out is so
118:57 - whenever i've worked on something and i
118:59 - deploy it to glitch
119:01 - i just um i just copy paste it basically
119:05 - but from what i understand glitch does
119:08 - have behind the scenes
119:10 - it can be a get remote so
119:14 - could i push this to glitch is there a
119:17 - way that i could just add
119:19 - like
119:23 - so git remote dash v like right now the
119:26 - live poll
119:26 - app is just on uh
119:30 - locally on this computer the code is
119:32 - pushed
119:33 - to github but on github i can't run
119:36 - um
119:39 - i can't um i can't run a node server on
119:42 - github it's just for hosting the repo
119:44 - um yes that will work you could also
119:45 - link to a github repo so i've done that
119:48 - but i feel like when i link to it it's
119:49 - not there's not a quick way to just like
119:51 - update the code
119:53 - so so simon yes i could use heroku but i
119:56 - don't want to right now
119:58 - um i could also use netlifly is like a
120:01 - thing
120:02 - that apparently i can connect vs code
120:05 - and glitch via an extension
120:07 - um this could go to sleep now i don't
120:10 - care about this being premium
120:12 - it can definitely go to sleep i would
120:13 - like to figure out
120:15 - the connecting to glitch
120:19 - so let's
120:23 - let me log into glitch i think i can do
120:25 - this without
120:27 - exposing any private information sign in
120:31 - so i believe my pro account
120:34 - is through my google account
120:38 - not my nyu one which i would be
120:41 - disturbed by putting
120:42 - publicly here but um it's easy to find
120:46 - my nyu address anywhere on the internet
120:48 - right it's i it's it's over for me with
120:50 - email so my
120:51 - all my email addresses are everywhere on
120:52 - the internet i get oh
120:55 - uh okay great okay great um
120:59 - hold on i'm just uh texting back my
121:01 - family to let them know status
121:16 - um there is uh
121:19 - there's some frittata action happening
121:22 - downstairs
121:23 - i definitely want to get in on that if i
121:26 - can
121:27 - um so it's this so now i need to enter
121:30 - my password
121:31 - which i'm going to have to
121:37 - i'm just going to switch to the camera
121:39 - here
121:41 - um i'm being invited to a raid
121:48 - you guess what that means for those of
121:50 - you who have watched the coding train
121:52 - enough
121:53 - um yeah
121:56 - um all right hold on hold on hold on
121:58 - hold on
122:00 - uh daniel uh
122:05 - by the way if you've emailed me at
122:09 - daniel at thecodingdrain.com recently i
122:11 - haven't checked that email address in a
122:12 - very long time
122:14 - so apologies
122:18 - [Music]
122:22 - the best way to interact
122:25 - with the community and me is through the
122:28 - discord
122:30 - okay i've gotta do my two-step
122:32 - verification
122:35 - come on uh yes it's me
122:44 - and
122:46 - here i am so i think i'm going to now
122:51 - uh go back here so this is my glitch
122:54 - account
122:54 - it's the one that i have a boosted
122:56 - account um
122:58 - you can see this renatbot thing if you
123:00 - want to explore that world that's my
123:02 - twitter bot that i've been working on
123:04 - that is that i've figured out everything
123:06 - through this
123:06 - uh web hook thing um so what i want to
123:09 - figure out is
123:10 - how can i this is the thing i need to
123:12 - figure out
123:14 - how can i add
123:18 - a glitch project as a remote and push
123:21 - from here to glitch
123:22 - do i need to create a new project first
123:26 - somebody said there's an extension
123:28 - glitch and vs code
123:29 - extension announcing glitch for visual
123:34 - studio code
123:35 - you can now uh
123:44 - you have access to full power of glitch
123:45 - within vs code all key features
123:47 - supported rewind console logs
123:49 - i don't know that this is what i want i
123:52 - really want to develop locally
123:54 - and then just push to glitch not okay
123:57 - um i'm looking at the chat
124:01 - nobody seems to know so how do i
124:04 - um how do i
124:07 - unlock maybe i should just make a new
124:09 - project and then make it a remote
124:11 - wouldn't that work i haven't done so
124:14 - much coding that i couldn't restart
124:16 - in any way let's try is there no blank
124:19 - one
124:19 - important so there's import from github
124:21 - that's what i want to do but i don't
124:22 - think that links it
124:24 - just but let me we should start that way
124:27 - all right so let's uh
124:30 - um let me make i need to make a git
124:33 - ignore file
124:39 - and that should have in node modules
124:43 - what else should that have
124:49 - oh that was put in the wrong place
124:54 - how do i get it back out here yes move
124:57 - it
124:59 - so node modules i also like to put
125:02 - ds store as those files prop up show up
125:06 - always
125:08 - new project import from github yeah i
125:12 - don't think it links it
125:13 - in the way that i want but maybe there's
125:15 - going to be a way that i can do that
125:17 - at least it'll be synced to start
125:22 - um so now uh
125:27 - boilerplate
125:31 - p5 and um
125:34 - express so i'm gonna do something
125:38 - ill-advisable which is just push
125:39 - directly to the main branch
125:42 - um don't don't do that don't try this at
125:46 - home
125:49 - uh so let's see everyone's saying it's
125:52 - not gonna link it
125:54 - but i think i'm gonna be able to do it
125:57 - what's the worst thing that can happen
125:59 - new project import from github
126:02 - oh look at this
126:06 - okay so notice that even though i'm sure
126:17 - i have this url open already in a tab i
126:19 - just open a new tab
126:22 - all right until someone tells me to stop
126:23 - doing this
126:28 - whoops
126:32 - um uh
126:36 - this would work unofficial add-on
126:39 - glitch project sync okay let's look at
126:43 - that
126:44 - hold on um glitch
126:49 - project sync uh vs code that's a vs code
126:54 - oh no
127:00 - glitch project sync uh
127:04 - github marketplace
127:05 - [Music]
127:10 - this uses the glitch api to export your
127:12 - github repo to your glitch project a
127:14 - public github
127:15 - existing glitch project oh boy
127:20 - i don't mind this so this must use like
127:23 - github actions or something
127:27 - but look your projects get url this is a
127:30 - glitch thing
127:31 - so i think i can just add this as a
127:32 - remote
127:34 - so i'm going to do this everybody i
127:37 - think i have an idea
127:38 - for the way i want to do this i'm going
127:40 - to
127:42 - i'm going to import this project
127:50 - i think this is going to work
127:59 - okay
128:05 - all right so now where is that so first
128:08 - i want to change
128:08 - right somewhere here i'm going to make
128:12 - this
128:12 - like coding train live poll
128:19 - okay now somewhere here i should be able
128:22 - to find
128:23 - the github
128:28 - the get remote url right
128:35 - um oh haydar is asking about qx5js yeah
128:39 - i'm excited about that i should
128:40 - definitely
128:41 - love to talk about that no okay
128:44 - where was that uh glitch
128:48 - github get remote
128:52 - oh look at this support
128:57 - oh this game is a git repository so yeah
128:59 - i need to
129:00 - find
129:03 - the project
129:07 - url on glitch
129:10 - i feel like it should show here boost
129:12 - this app editor settings
129:17 - why am i not seeing where this is
129:20 - like on that page i was just looking at
129:25 - import and export okay import and export
129:32 - where's the imported export
129:36 - i know tools at the bottom
129:39 - got it all right so this should oh
129:43 - connect interesting downloadable let's
129:46 - try this
129:49 - so let's just for a second see what this
129:52 - is
129:53 - [Music]
129:56 - yeah so why can't i just
130:00 - oh but to be able to push to it i
130:03 - probably have to have
130:04 - like authenticate somehow
130:08 - like i can't just do git remote add
130:10 - first of all
130:11 - i can't show people this otherwise
130:12 - you'll be able to if this were possible
130:14 - you'd be able to like just hack it
130:16 - get remote add glitch this
130:21 - so get i'm i'm like throwing caution to
130:23 - the wind here
130:24 - like so could i do um
130:28 - i mean this shouldn't work if this work
130:30 - doesn't if this works it's a security
130:32 - issue
130:33 - [Music]
130:40 - um
130:42 - test commit get push
130:45 - glitch main
130:49 - that worked oh it made a new branch
130:53 - though i guess is it
130:57 - that was weird
131:00 - that was weird
131:06 - okay hold on what is it must be called
131:08 - master i guess
131:11 - boy i everybody
131:22 - no
131:25 - what is the branch name oh can i do get
131:28 - fetch
131:32 - that fetched everything right okay
131:35 - uh glitch slash master new branch
131:40 - let me put something more obvious into
131:42 - the code
132:01 - [Music]
132:09 - [Music]
132:15 - [Music]
132:18 - is this a thing oh
132:21 - new branch i don't understand
132:26 - huh i'm looking at the chat
132:31 - old branch name instead of maine yeah
132:37 - i guess maybe i should use the um
132:43 - maybe i should use the oh hold on i know
132:48 - what to do here
132:49 - let's go into the glitch terminal
132:53 - now this is very
132:55 - [Music]
133:00 - okay
133:02 - [Music]
133:05 - okay okay on track file on branch master
133:16 - there's no how do i
133:21 - main import master
133:25 - so it's called master but it didn't let
133:28 - me
133:33 - push
133:39 - does not match any
133:44 - why not use heroku i i could use heroku
133:48 - i want to learn how to get this to work
133:50 - with glitch
133:52 - i mean i could go back to this other
133:54 - thing i probably should go back to
133:56 - this wherever that was
134:00 - this
134:10 - um
134:14 - this isn't unofficial
134:21 - you you will just need to merge on the
134:23 - glitch tournament now oh
134:26 - so that's a way i could do it that's two
134:28 - steps it's an extra step
134:30 - [Music]
134:31 - but um cj is exactly right git merge
134:34 - main
134:34 - oh no i'm in the wrong place so
134:38 - confusing
134:41 - sorry that this is so tiny and that my
134:44 - microphone is blocking it
134:47 - conflict that's fine
134:52 - are you kidding me
135:01 - automatic merch okay
135:06 - both added yeah i know
135:09 - but how do i this also it's like not
135:12 - updating
135:14 - like what if i refresh the page
135:17 - it's like not updating what i'm seeing
135:20 - here
135:30 - by the way there's settings here oh oh i
135:31 - can make this much bigger for people to
135:34 - see
135:37 - that's good that's maybe too much
135:43 - whoops so probably make more sense for
135:47 - me to use first of all i could just do
135:48 - this on glitch
135:50 - i guess i thought this would be easier
135:54 - um both add a git add file
136:00 - i don't know
136:19 - [Music]
136:29 - it doesn't like update let's see
136:38 - i know might need to refresh the page
136:44 - now
136:55 - [Music]
136:58 - um
137:04 - like
137:12 - uh can i like
137:18 - and look at what's in the oh yeah
137:20 - look
137:23 - like look what's here why does it not
137:26 - match what's is this like a different
137:27 - branch
137:29 - so weird i don't understand how glitch
137:30 - works
137:33 - whoops
137:35 - [Music]
137:39 - so i'm like fixing it
137:44 - by using nano my text editor of choice
138:08 - okay
138:12 - no why does it not
138:17 - show up just do it on glitch for now
138:22 - maybe
138:22 - okay i guess i'm gonna
138:26 - i guess i'm gonna have to um
138:29 - i guess i'm gonna have to explore this
138:31 - later this is like i'm totally lost here
138:34 - um and um thank you for those of you who
138:37 - have joined up here anonymous and prasad
138:40 - brew
138:41 - but one thing that i can do now at least
138:44 - is i can uh
138:48 - refresh app on changes i can view the
138:51 - project where do i do that
138:53 - show uh in a new window
138:56 - so okay so what i can do at least
138:59 - is i'm now going over to open broadcast
139:01 - studio
139:03 - and i'm creating a new
139:07 - browser and i'm going to do this like
139:11 - live poll
139:15 - and i'm going to put in
139:19 - um
139:22 - coding dash train dash live
139:29 - dash poll
139:33 - dot glitch dot me
139:36 - and let's put that in
139:45 - okay so now
139:48 - uh i can close this i've successfully
139:51 - created my
139:53 - poll overlay right not like when
139:57 - if and when i do an actual poll
140:01 - it could show up here uh on the page
140:05 - right so you can see here like this is
140:07 - not this is if i move i
140:09 - don't i don't know why processing is
140:10 - open here
140:12 - um so i have my uh overlay right here
140:17 - wonderful
140:20 - so this is where i'm going with this and
140:23 - the reason why i want to use
140:24 - glitch is so i can have a public url
140:26 - that i can just load as an overlay
140:28 - but i prefer while i'm sort of working
140:30 - it out
140:31 - to like code locally so maybe what i
140:34 - need to do
140:36 - is and make more sense and also have
140:38 - this as a github repo
140:40 - it maybe what i need to do is use that
140:44 - like
140:44 - visual studio code extension i don't
140:46 - know there's got to be a way to do this
140:57 - so i i'm surprised that i haven't been
140:59 - kicked out yet it's 12
141:00 - 20. i should probably finish up this
141:02 - live stream maybe i'll look at one more
141:04 - community contribution
141:10 - i thought of something else to add to my
141:13 - list of side projects
141:14 - actually that i'm really excited about
141:16 - [Music]
141:18 - um
141:21 - it's this vinyl cutter and plotter
141:28 - was i editing this
141:32 - maybe i never hit space oh i'm doing
141:35 - something bad here
141:38 - doing something bad i'm doing it anyway
141:43 - um side projects
141:47 - is
141:51 - vinyl cutter for cutting and plotter i'm
141:54 - going to show you what i have
141:59 - the vs code extension allows you to edit
142:01 - a glitch project inside of this
142:02 - and syncs the code so that's definitely
142:05 - that's what i should do i'll explore
142:06 - that um
142:10 - right i could also like ultimately i can
142:12 - just like
142:13 - work on the whole thing when i'm done
142:15 - uploaded to glitch i was just curious if
142:17 - i could
142:18 - you know while i'm iterating like just
142:20 - quickly sync it
142:21 - and i think probably the way to do that
142:24 - um
142:24 - is this vs code extension but um i want
142:28 - to
142:28 - uh just um quickly
142:33 - grab something walking around the attic
142:36 - here
142:44 - i recently both made a purchase
142:52 - um coming back here
142:55 - sitting in the chair i'll turn the
142:56 - camera back on um
142:59 - this is uh and it's not in the box it's
143:03 - why it's very light
143:04 - it's unpacked but this is a cameo
143:07 - silhouette cameo four
143:09 - it is a vinyl cutter
143:12 - and plotter you can see like things that
143:15 - you can make with it here
143:17 - so i want to you can make stickers and
143:21 - all sorts of things i don't really know
143:23 - anything about this but i feel like
143:25 - i want to start making fun physical
143:27 - things for the coding train
143:29 - so this is also we'll i'll definitely
143:31 - spend a saturday
143:32 - one of the saturday live streams hooking
143:34 - this up and trying to do stuff on it
143:36 - so if you're interested in that stay
143:39 - tuned
143:40 - um yeah and maybe i can use my overhead
143:44 - camera to like show that
143:49 - let me push down the green screen for a
143:52 - second
143:53 - before i go
143:59 - you can see the white wall behind me i
144:01 - think i should probably
144:04 - uh turn off the chroma keying if i'm
144:08 - going to do that
144:10 - very quickly that's not a huge
144:14 - difference
144:15 - so this is where i am uh without the
144:18 - green screen behind me
144:20 - and while i have not been
144:25 - interrupted yet although i i def see if
144:28 - i have any text messages
144:38 - i am going to do i have scissors up here
144:41 - you should see what's in this attic
144:43 - piles and piles of arts and craft
144:45 - supplies
144:47 - um and yet just looking for a scissors
144:50 - i'm not sure where i find one
144:52 - i also need to take gloria for a walk
144:54 - i'm just gonna open the box
144:56 - and then i'm gonna go then i can't find
144:58 - i don't know if i can open the box
144:59 - unless i can find a knife or scissors
145:02 - this is not something the chat can help
145:03 - you
145:05 - there's some knitting supplies
145:09 - yarns and dolls post-it notes pictures
145:12 - of cats
145:14 - they what is this
145:17 - oh an emergency preparedness kit that's
145:20 - good
145:21 - um box full of stuff
145:27 - um lego set
145:31 - tiara rubik's cube
145:36 - can you even hear me over there there's
145:38 - a cute uh
145:40 - elephant stuffed animal
145:48 - i know where that no there's gotta be a
145:50 - scissor somewhere so much stuff
145:55 - legos sketchbook oh here's a tool
146:04 - toolbox
146:18 - here we go this'll do
146:25 - found something so
146:29 - take a look i'll probably hook this up
146:32 - later
146:35 - don't don't try this at home hopefully
146:38 - i'm not going to hurt myself here
146:43 - open this box
146:48 - the camera image is cropped yeah to
146:50 - where the green screen is i could widen
146:52 - it now but i don't want to
146:55 - mess up too much stuff if you're just
146:58 - tuning in i'm basically done
146:59 - i just like uh wanna while i haven't
147:02 - been
147:03 - um interrupted yet i'm opening
147:08 - my everyday calendar box
147:13 - here's the everyday calendar which i
147:15 - ordered from kickstarter from
147:16 - a youtuber uh simone gertz
147:21 - there's also a t-shirt
147:29 - cool
147:36 - maybe i'll wear this later today or wash
147:39 - it first i don't know
147:41 - all right so that's this box
147:45 - now
147:57 - wow he did such a good job with this
148:01 - poster see i want to decorate this wall
148:06 - but um and then like sometimes use the
148:09 - green screen and sometimes not
148:13 - look at this this is gorgeous
148:22 - absolutely gorgeous oh you know one of
148:23 - my favorite things in life
148:26 - one of my absolute favorite things in
148:27 - life is peeling off
148:30 - oh my god it's so nice oh i'm going to
148:32 - leave it on though
148:33 - quietly on my own later but also just
148:36 - protecting it
148:37 - so i want to leave it on right now to
148:38 - continue to protect it look at this look
148:40 - at
148:41 - see plug and usb
148:44 - so i should be able to program this
148:46 - myself through this connection
148:48 - i also should be able to hook it up to
148:49 - the web my goal
148:51 - is to think of this as a grid of pixels
148:55 - and uh be able to like move my hand in
148:57 - front of it and interact with it
148:59 - now what what it's meant for is you uh
149:02 - you pre you you want to like if i want
149:04 - to medi do something every day like
149:05 - every day i want to meditate
149:07 - so i'm just going to use it as a
149:09 - calendar but i think there's a lot of
149:10 - other ways it can be used
149:12 - and so um and
149:22 - uh here's the plug
149:25 - a pin
149:29 - there's a pin this is very cute this pin
149:33 - and see if it'll focus come on camera
149:36 - autofocus
149:37 - magic autofocus yeah see that pin
149:43 - plug adapters for different like
149:48 - european
149:48 - thingies that's very thoughtful
149:53 - and more adapters
149:57 - let's see we can plug this in
150:01 - how do i mount it on the wall it has
150:04 - like
150:05 - these so i just any kind of like
150:08 - uh i guess i need something that i can
150:10 - put in the like picture because i think
150:11 - it would look nice
150:12 - here i mean i don't know if if this is a
150:14 - little bit much to just have this always
150:15 - behind me
150:16 - and usually i'll use the green screen so
150:19 - but maybe i'll put it off to the side
150:21 - but i think for right now i would like
150:23 - for you to be able to see it
150:26 - so a way that i could prop it up
150:29 - or i have an idea you will bear with me
150:32 - for a second
150:35 - i'm gonna move my uh move some stuff
150:42 - [Music]
150:44 - around
150:47 - [Music]
150:49 - i'll just do this for right now and if i
150:51 - do this
150:53 - um you can see here um
150:57 - here it is so
151:01 - if i want to plug it in
151:16 - and i think it's just an arduino in
151:18 - there that's what i read
151:24 - the poster is a guide okay i should look
151:27 - at that
151:31 - oh what's funny is um
151:34 - what it says is i made the everyday
151:36 - calendar because i wanted to make sure
151:38 - i meditated every day uh
151:43 - and that's the example that i gave that
151:45 - probably where i read it
151:47 - use this as a template if you need help
151:49 - hanging your calendar
151:51 - i know keyholes can be a pain to mark
151:53 - out oh that's so cool
151:55 - what a smart boy she really thought of
151:58 - everything here
152:00 - um i just want to plug it in before i go
152:03 - um and i'm going to have to research how
152:05 - to program it
152:07 - so beautiful
152:13 - um so i
152:16 - this is not a very long cord
152:19 - um how does it take to move this
152:23 - very slowly i do have a plug here
152:27 - so it's going to reach it's very very
152:30 - close
152:30 - i need to unplug something else
152:37 - oh i have to i have to put the right
152:40 - this is so clever
152:44 - i have to put the right adapter on it
152:47 - which is so like this is the plug and
152:50 - then there's a bunch of these adapters
152:51 - this is the us one
152:53 - so i think i just can show you here
152:57 - i'm just going to i want to do more
152:58 - physical stuff here at home
153:01 - and then i'm going to unplug this light
153:05 - a different light plug it in
153:09 - and it's on it's plugged in do i have to
153:12 - turn it on
153:14 - oh it's it's lighting up oh wow it lit
153:17 - up
153:18 - oh i'm getting text messages uh oh the
153:21 - frittata
153:22 - the frittata was eaten i missed the
153:24 - frittata everybody
153:27 - the message says there's a little left
153:29 - for you
153:30 - but we ate it i'm sorry it's okay
153:34 - uh
153:38 - um so now i guess i can
153:41 - like isn't it touch or something that
153:44 - these go on and off when you touch them
153:46 - yeah
153:50 - yeah oh you're not seeing so like for
153:52 - example right here
153:54 - press it
154:00 - can i and can i press it off or
154:03 - what do these do
154:07 - nighttime uh i guess i need to take off
154:11 - this
154:12 - all right everybody
154:17 - i didn't want to do it but
154:20 - it had to be done because i have a
154:28 - feeling
154:31 - cool
154:34 - so what do these do at the bottom do
154:36 - these do something
154:39 - is there like some switches
154:45 - so i want to connect this by usb maybe
154:48 - there's some like software i can run
154:50 - or i can write my own software for it
154:52 - but anyway this will be this is
154:54 - definitely a project i want to do
154:57 - uh more info here oh i guess
155:01 - yeah so um
155:06 - there's a usp port um
155:15 - uh sorry i'm seeing where i am in the
155:16 - past here um all right i think i've got
155:19 - to go
155:19 - it's 12 35 got to move on with my day
155:22 - the kids did not interrupt me which is
155:24 - kind of amazing the poster will guide
155:26 - you i don't
155:27 - i appreciate everyone saying this is a
155:29 - guide but the poster doesn't have
155:32 - a lot of information on it's a wonderful
155:34 - beautiful poster
155:35 - um and it's a it fits right on top
155:40 - and it has in you don't
155:45 - hold january 1st for 45 seconds to reset
155:48 - your calendar
155:55 - how long is 45 seconds
156:14 - anyway i think i probably i might sort
156:16 - of try to work on this next saturday
156:19 - so i think i'll do some research into it
156:23 - i don't think i got to 45 seconds um
156:26 - and try to hang it on the wall uh
156:28 - there's a nice spot for it right over
156:30 - there actually
156:31 - then i can put a camera on it let's see
156:34 - if i can
156:35 - show you the spot that i'm thinking of
156:42 - so um
156:46 - basically oh it's upside down
156:51 - um i'm thinking of putting it on the
156:53 - wall
156:55 - right here
156:58 - it's the perfect width and then i can
157:00 - put a camera on this while i'm live
157:02 - streaming
157:03 - and uh you know
157:07 - this is a really nice spot for it oh
157:08 - it's beautiful
157:10 - i mean it's it's so beautiful i almost
157:13 - want to put this somewhere in the house
157:14 - that's more visible
157:16 - but i guess to experiment and program it
157:18 - putting it here is great so i'm going to
157:19 - work on hanging it i'm going to unplug
157:21 - it
157:24 - i'm going to put it somewhere to be safe
157:26 - um
157:27 - this mess of an attic
157:32 - i'm going to work on hanging it on the
157:34 - wall
157:36 - um and getting a usb cord a long one
157:38 - that can go to it
157:40 - and then i will
157:46 - um i will come back to it oh i hear
157:48 - footsteps
157:50 - i think it's time for me to go
157:53 - um and so stay tuned for
157:56 - more um i will be back
158:00 - hopefully every saturday 10 a.m eastern
158:03 - that's kind of my plan
158:05 - but uh here here's a plea to you please
158:08 - join the discord um it is the best
158:12 - place to get up updates
158:15 - on when i'll be live streaming and when
158:17 - new videos are coming out
158:19 - um that when you join the discord for
158:22 - the first time you need to go to the
158:23 - readme where there's the code of conduct
158:25 - and react with an emoji
158:27 - and that will unlock all the channels
158:28 - for you um
158:31 - and um but that you know this is my my
158:34 - ambition for this semester
158:37 - is fridays recording the sequence
158:39 - tutorials saturdays doing
158:40 - side projects um saturdays will be live
158:44 - streams the fridays will not be live
