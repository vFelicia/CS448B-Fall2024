00:01 - good morning oh I'm so glad to be back
00:04 - here on the coding train in the morning
00:06 - I'm playing on the background a new song
00:09 - by somebody it is called the k-nearest
00:18 - neighbor remix by third culture records
00:21 - i guess it's from the latest live stream
00:24 - i'm having trouble talking with this
00:26 - music on so welcome my name is Dan I
00:29 - hope that I'm live streaming I hope that
00:30 - everyone can hear me I'm checking some
00:32 - chat things going and okay it is live
00:36 - okay great so this is the coding train
00:38 - good my name is Dan Schiffman and I am
00:42 - here most Fridays almost every Friday
00:45 - often in the late afternoon but I'm here
00:47 - this morning it is now the end of the
00:49 - semester at New York University next
00:52 - week
00:53 - if you happen to be in the New York City
00:54 - area my students have a show of all
00:56 - their work Tuesday and Wednesday
00:59 - here at 721 Broadway so there's a lot of
01:02 - stuff going on for setting up for that
01:03 - that I'm doing this afternoon and so I'm
01:06 - here this morning instead so what's
01:09 - what's happening well look at all the
01:12 - board to to to all sorts of stuff okay
01:14 - nobody's complaining this yo this
01:17 - slightly strange invisible bug is back
01:21 - so I have a bunch of things that I want
01:24 - to discuss and go over and do and I
01:28 - think I've already forgotten what those
01:30 - things are
01:32 - Oh does it's a special Thursday episode
01:35 - in the let me fix that every I'm gonna
01:41 - change this to say every Friday okay
01:44 - should save that now so first of all to
01:48 - the young fellow who stopped me in Union
01:52 - Square this morning it said hey are you
01:54 - coding rainbow hello I doubt you're
01:56 - actually watching but that was like a
01:57 - lot of fun that somebody actually
01:59 - stopped me in the subway at Union Square
02:01 - to ask if I was coding rainbow and first
02:03 - of all a couple things number one is as
02:05 - much as I would like to be I am NOT
02:07 - physically a rainbow though I am close
02:10 - to one perhaps maybe
02:14 - and also it's the Kotick train now no
02:17 - more coding rainbow sadly ok uh-huh
02:22 - so a blue boys 79 who has two exams
02:26 - tomorrow you should probably go study
02:28 - for those exams ok let's put back on I
02:30 - realize I forgot to do something here
02:32 - which I I need to do I'm gonna put back
02:34 - on the actually going before I do that
02:37 - let me mention something so I'm trying a
02:39 - new experience or two different ways to
02:42 - interact with the audience and some of
02:45 - you know that I have a patron group I'm
02:48 - using a crowdfunding site called patreon
02:50 - calm if you go to patreon patreon calm
02:55 - slash coding train you are welcome to
02:57 - participate and contribute in this and
02:59 - you'll get an invite to a slack channel
03:00 - which I am NOT looking at but I'm going
03:01 - to look at right now nobody's put any
03:04 - messages in this like channel but there
03:06 - it is actually there are some from
03:08 - earlier but not since I started ok but
03:10 - I've take questions on Twitter and I
03:12 - have this like github repository of
03:13 - trying all sorts of different things
03:14 - something that I thought I would try
03:15 - that someone suggested there is a coding
03:18 - train subreddit that somebody created
03:21 - and I put there a question thread for
03:24 - Friday May 12th at 10:30 a.m. so here is
03:28 - where you could I'm gonna if this goes
03:30 - well I'll do this every week I will
03:33 - people can post their questions and then
03:35 - upload them so what did I have for
03:37 - breakfast I'm going to upload this oops
03:40 - oh I'm not signed in can I do it is it
03:42 - what's the chance I'm gonna actually
03:44 - know my password to sign in to read it
03:46 - wow that was really lucky ok I'm gonna
03:50 - upload this question oops and then I am
03:53 - going to answer it what did I have for
03:56 - breakfast I had some granola with some
04:01 - almond milk and a banana that's what I
04:04 - have that's all I had
04:10 - ok so while I'm talking and wasting time
04:14 - if any of you want to go and add some
04:16 - questions or upload any questions I'll
04:18 - come back to this in a moment ok let me
04:21 - do something that
04:23 - that I need to hike Shahid I love those
04:27 - emojis so Baltimore Papa pistachio guess
04:31 - who is from the great city of Baltimore
04:34 - go owes me that's where I grew up I was
04:40 - not born in Baltimore I was born in New
04:42 - Haven Connecticut little fact there when
04:45 - I was four weeks old I moved to
04:46 - Baltimore other interesting tidbits here
04:49 - we go okay I forgot something very
04:59 - important which is my green paper check
05:05 - and use for my strange invisible tricks
05:07 - but I put it on this laptop
05:11 - [Music]
05:28 - [Music]
05:32 - so I think this is good to others
05:34 - something what's down here the paper
05:38 - hold on there we go okay
05:55 - okay here's the thing I I think it could
06:01 - use some auto-tune me all of my songs
06:05 - that aren't myself they give you some
06:12 - audit because my voice is really not my
06:15 - instrument so to speak okay let's see so
06:22 - what do i else do I have to say anything
06:25 - else to say I don't think so I'm gonna
06:29 - get started soon so okay so I'm gonna go
06:31 - look at some of these questions in a
06:33 - second but what is going to happen on
06:35 - today's episode of the coding train well
06:38 - guess what you might be aware that I
06:40 - have been plugging away at making a lot
06:43 - of videos about machine learning
06:45 - artificial intelligence I have this
06:47 - syllabus from a course that is now
06:49 - wrapped up at NYU but I'm over the
06:51 - course of this summer dedicated to
06:53 - making I'm committed to making all the
06:56 - videos that go along with this course
06:58 - and where I think if I look at the these
07:02 - are all the examples here I'm kind of
07:04 - somewhere here in week 3 and last week I
07:09 - did some videos about nearest-neighbor
07:11 - algorithms and made a little movie
07:13 - recommendation system but it's been a
07:16 - very long hectic week I need to take a
07:20 - break from this so one of the things
07:22 - that I have is I have this rainbow
07:26 - topics repository which is my current
07:27 - system for taking suggestions and you
07:31 - can see people have added issues here
07:34 - sometimes their questions sometimes
07:35 - there's are ideas and things I could do
07:37 - and I sometimes like to sort it by
07:42 - thumbs up and now I can look and look at
07:47 - this so a couple things
07:49 - machine learning that's what I'm working
07:51 - on I'm gonna get back to that probably
07:53 - next week
07:54 - computer vision that would be I've made
07:57 - a bunch of videos with various computer
07:58 - vision topics and I definitely want to
08:00 - make some more and then I noticed a
08:02 - sweeper so first of all minesweeper is
08:05 - the
08:05 - third-most thumbs-up added topic in my
08:10 - rainbow topics github repository so i
08:14 - would like to listen to what the people
08:17 - want and so I wanna I'm gonna do it
08:21 - it also says patron recommended which
08:23 - means that somebody who is in the patron
08:25 - group and has access to the repository
08:27 - added that label and I like to listen to
08:30 - the patrons as well it's already getting
08:32 - warm and your hold on a second one of
08:34 - these days you can't see me anymore but
08:36 - I'm gonna attempt to turn on the climate
08:39 - control system in here okay so that's
08:42 - what's gonna happen today
08:44 - minesweeper to be honest with you I
08:47 - definitely have played minesweeper in
08:50 - fact I think I've been addicted to it in
08:52 - the past but it's got to be at least I
08:54 - mean it's got to be at least 10 years 15
08:58 - years since I played minesweeper I don't
09:03 - actually really remember how it works
09:05 - but let's I believe if I look at this
09:08 - there is a I am so Mattias con tilde
09:13 - here made this oh and there's another
09:16 - one so let's take a look let's Ida
09:18 - haven't looked at this one look at this
09:22 - oh this is way better than anything I'm
09:24 - ever going to do oh wait oh this is just
09:26 - an image so this is oh it's a
09:28 - minesweeper clone made in processing to
09:31 - download how interesting let's download
09:33 - it I don't want to look at the code so
09:37 - let's see if we can download this should
09:39 - hopefully just be the application yes
09:44 - six modules now natively breaking news I
09:46 - need a breaking news so will somebody
09:48 - make me a excellent like coding breaking
09:51 - news sound effect that I could play
09:52 - breaking news it's just a timpani sound
10:00 - yes six modules are now natively
10:03 - supported in Chrome Canary
10:05 - behind the experimental web platform
10:07 - flag there's your coding breaking news
10:10 - this morning
10:12 - okay did this download let's open this
10:16 - up yes this looks like an application
10:18 - here I'm gonna open it up yes I want to
10:22 - open this from the internet I don't
10:23 - Internet
10:24 - I'm opening you where are you need this
10:32 - open run minesweeper there you are
10:36 - nope they are okay that didn't work I
10:38 - don't know why let's try this let's try
10:42 - this one okay so I think the idea here
10:46 - is that there are there's a grid with a
10:50 - bunch of bombs and I don't want to click
10:52 - on a bomb and if I click on a cell it's
10:55 - gonna tell me how many cells next to it
10:58 - have a bomb so only one out of these
11:00 - eight neighbors has a bomb so hopefully
11:02 - this one does not hopefully this one
11:04 - does not this one has two neighbors we
11:06 - could strengthen them oh boy
11:07 - then we could start to use our brain
11:10 - logic to understand well let's whip me
11:14 - if i zoom in even more here okay there
11:19 - are two okay wait a second here is there
11:23 - a bomb not necessarily not necessarily
11:26 - there are two bombs within one two three
11:28 - four five six spots all right I win ever
11:32 - let's just guess wait I want it Oh Oh
11:37 - game over oh okay so it is now hereby
11:42 - established that I am terrible at
11:44 - playing the game of minesweeper but I
11:46 - think this gives me enough but that's
11:49 - what I thought what I yeah so if you
11:51 - click on a cell with no bombs anywhere
11:56 - near it it will unfold in a beautiful
12:00 - animation all the way around the grid
12:04 - until I find some spots that have bombs
12:06 - next to it so that's one thing that I
12:08 - really do need to think about here do I
12:10 - want to program this beautiful little
12:12 - animation
12:12 - or just have it show us all the spots so
12:15 - that's something we're going to think
12:17 - about it think about I'm going to think
12:19 - about okay I think I can do this
12:21 - alright let's here we go now I'm gonna
12:28 - go to my new favorite website strawpoll
12:32 - calm how long will it take me Dan your
12:39 - chief Mon to program Mine Sweeper 15
12:49 - minutes 30 minutes can I spell minutes
12:56 - 45 minutes 60 minutes over 60 minutes
13:05 - okay let's go here we go creep pol
13:11 - strawpoll / s31 for a gge okay let's see
13:17 - let's viewers the results so far there
13:20 - are no results cuz I'm in the future you
13:22 - haven't even seen this yet but now you
13:23 - probably have cuz it's about 20 seconds
13:25 - 20 seconds uh-huh yeah no way 50 minutes
13:29 - now here's the thing let me just let me
13:31 - say a few things about this I am NOT
13:36 - going to necessarily actually I mean
13:39 - yeah I know I'm gonna program the whole
13:41 - thing I mean here's the thing when I
13:44 - made I one of the reasons like I like to
13:47 - do these challenges is to not do
13:49 - everything I like to do the beginning
13:51 - steps of a project that show the
13:54 - fundamental pieces and that leave room
13:56 - for people watching or learning or
13:58 - following along to make their own to
14:00 - finish the project to make their own
14:02 - creative variation so anyway but I did
14:07 - and often I do coding challenges in
14:09 - multiple parts but I think when I do
14:12 - these simple and minesweepers not that
14:14 - simple
14:14 - simple game coding challenges I like the
14:18 - idea of doing them all as one video even
14:20 - if it
14:21 - something like 60 minutes long so you
14:25 - know I could change my mind I guess but
14:27 - I'm think I'm going to attempt to do
14:30 - this you know it's I'm gonna attempt to
14:34 - do this within an hour
14:36 - that's gonna be my personal goal in one
14:38 - video with no editing so even if I get
14:41 - really stuck you know I won't edit
14:45 - that's kind of my plan let's look at
14:46 - what you guys think so I'm gonna say 60
14:49 - minutes 30 pins you guys have over 60
14:53 - minutes yes okay that's not such a
14:56 - surprise there okay now let now I think
14:59 - I gave it enough time where are we I've
15:00 - been streaming for 15 minutes I've got
15:04 - until like 12:00 12:30 so a little bit
15:08 - of a shortened day here I don't know
15:10 - wait since when a two hour livestream
15:13 - became like a short one but that seems
15:16 - to be where I have these days oh okay
15:22 - here we go now let me refresh this page
15:24 - and see I don't think people are up
15:29 - voting these questions can the can't the
15:32 - comments be right wouldn't it have like
15:36 - this shows like a little I know about
15:38 - how the internet works shouldn't these
15:40 - have like or maybe there's okay let me
15:44 - answer some of these questions
15:48 - so red hand dev who posts a lot of great
15:51 - examples and actually some tutorials to
15:53 - YouTube as well on Twitter asks how do
15:56 - you deployed a nodejs server client
15:59 - multiplayer sketch such as in earlier
16:01 - tutorials using Express in other words
16:04 - how do you go from using a local server
16:06 - on one machine to serving from the web
16:09 - okay okay I'm sorry sorry that is it it
16:17 - says for points to the right of the
16:19 - username oh it does why I'm blah I
16:22 - cannot see but now I see I I
16:29 - wish this was like it's been 30 minutes
16:35 - since I turned that camera on okay all
16:39 - right um okay so okay so let's talk
16:45 - about this so there are different
16:48 - options you need a machine that is
16:52 - connected to the Internet so that's on
16:56 - the simplest level that's what you need
16:58 - you know your laptop that you're running
17:00 - if you if I'm not running anything right
17:04 - now but if you're running a server and
17:05 - you're looking at your web page
17:06 - localhost on your laptop somebody else
17:09 - could view that if your laptop is
17:11 - connected to the Internet and that
17:13 - person happens to know your IP address
17:15 - so ultimately if you are a web server
17:18 - and you are open to the Internet and
17:20 - it's receiving accepting of connections
17:23 - then you're ready to go now most likely
17:25 - you don't want to say from your
17:28 - apartment always leave your laptop on
17:31 - 24/7 to be a web server so most of the
17:36 - time if you want to deploy a web
17:38 - application somewhere work and live more
17:39 - permanently you're going to pay for
17:41 - access to a server through some service
17:45 - now there are some free or sort of like
17:47 - semi free options you know I'm not
17:51 - sponsored by any web hosting companies
17:53 - at the moment if I were I would do a
17:55 - little advertisement for them but I'll
17:57 - name you a few that I happen to use or
17:59 - know about digitalocean
18:00 - is one the one reason why I'm mentioning
18:03 - that is there is the github student
18:05 - developer pack so if you happen to be a
18:08 - student you can get this developer pack
18:14 - which gives you some free access to it
18:17 - gives you 50 dollars in credits to
18:19 - digitalocean looks like it gives you
18:20 - another one I was going to mention is
18:22 - AWS so 110 in bonus AWS credits so
18:27 - Amazon web servers is another service
18:30 - you can use digitalocean
18:32 - guess what oh I forgot I'm so excited
18:35 - I'm not sponsored by this but I am very
18:39 - excited about glitch so glitch
18:42 - a new service it is a code editor it is
18:48 - a sharing service it is a place where
18:50 - you can make web applications and
18:52 - actually live and you can run note
18:53 - applications through glitch and use it
18:55 - for free and run it on the web so it's
18:58 - made by a company called fog Creek maybe
19:03 - and I there's lots of wonderful people
19:07 - that I happen to know that work on it
19:08 - for example Jen Schiffer who is a
19:11 - Twitter hero of mine
19:13 - I should fault you should definitely
19:14 - follow her Twitter if you don't what is
19:17 - it Jen shiver Twitter this is like my
19:22 - Jen money dot biz I don't know what her
19:25 - Twitter is let's see here I'm here's
19:31 - your website at Jen Schiffer coding
19:37 - trade is sponsored by at Jen shipper Jen
19:41 - German button okay so really it's like
19:45 - the best my Twitter account is like the
19:47 - lamest thing ever it's like I'm live
19:48 - streaming now or I thought laughs a new
19:50 - video tutorial anyway so glitch that's a
19:53 - great I want to do some stuff some
19:55 - challenges with click glitch and use it
20:02 - maybe have a guest hey anybody from
20:04 - glitch you want to come and talk about
20:05 - it on the coding train it seems like a
20:07 - wonderful service I'm hoping to use it
20:08 - in one of my classes next year okay
20:10 - we're out where was i answering this
20:12 - question so so that's it then once you
20:15 - have this account how do you deploy it
20:19 - well how do you get your you have to get
20:20 - your code files there somehow glitch for
20:23 - example it's a web interface for doing
20:25 - that AWS or digitalocean you can use you
20:29 - can FTP or SFTP secure File Transfer
20:32 - Protocol which is a way of transferring
20:35 - files from your laptop to this web
20:37 - server then you can login this is my I
20:43 - was gonna this is my gift which is a
20:46 - weird thing to say by the way I like my
20:48 - whole life basically is just like can I
20:50 - do something weird enough on the coding
20:51 - training that people will make a gif out
20:52 - of it so this is me logging into AWS
20:55 - and in terminal and then you can type
20:59 - node this and forever this and I do have
21:02 - some videos about how to do this this is
21:03 - the worst answer this question ever so
21:06 - anyway uh maybe I'll make some more
21:08 - video tutorials and that sort of thing
21:09 - about this okay let me refresh this page
21:11 - and see what else we've got here oh yeah
21:14 - so github so this was a good question
21:16 - I'm it would be magical if this were
21:19 - possible hosting from github so there is
21:21 - github pages and I made some videos
21:23 - about github pages you cannot execute
21:25 - server-side code on github pages it's
21:28 - just for hosting files so it's this is
21:31 - of one of the most confusing things
21:32 - about doing web programming right you
21:34 - could write a server in nodejs
21:36 - you could write a game like minesweeper
21:39 - in JavaScript you could write a server
21:40 - in JavaScript you could write a
21:42 - client-side JavaScript on even confusing
21:46 - myself just talking about it
21:47 - you could write a server app KS you
21:51 - could write a p5 sketch maybe call that
21:53 - sketch touch ass
21:54 - both of those are javascript files both
21:56 - of those you might upload to a web
21:58 - server the difference is where do those
22:01 - run when you write a node program that
22:04 - code executes on the server when you
22:07 - write a p5 sketch while the javascript
22:09 - file lives on the server it actually
22:12 - gets sent to the clients computer the
22:14 - web browser and execute on that clients
22:16 - computer itself so github is a place
22:18 - where you can host your JavaScript files
22:21 - that get static files really it's called
22:23 - static cuz they don't execute and get
22:25 - served up and run on the client computer
22:27 - but you cannot run your own server side
22:30 - code why would you do one versus the
22:32 - other server-side code is good for
22:34 - saving to a database communicating with
22:37 - a certain when Takei ting to some like
22:40 - security privacy thing as host words of
22:42 - reasons why you might want to write
22:43 - server-side code and I if you go some
22:45 - too and look at some I know tutorials
22:46 - you'll see reasons why okay it's a good
22:52 - idea dan doing this bind sweeper no no
22:54 - no no server-side and client-side code
22:57 - although I'm tempted now to do
22:59 - minesweeper use a glitch oh boy oh boy
23:04 - do I dare do I dare this baby nervous
23:09 - and now I feel like I have to be I got
23:12 - very anxious about this okay alright
23:16 - let's let's take a moment I bite so I
23:18 - answered one question I answer to
23:20 - because I also said what I had for
23:21 - breakfast okay so how that's going tell
23:27 - us more about your background how did
23:29 - you get into programming how did you get
23:30 - into teaching and writing 23 minutes
23:34 - okay I want to get into the coding stuff
23:36 - soon so let me try to answer this
23:38 - question I got into program I don't have
23:41 - a good I wish I had a good answer for
23:42 - this question but I got into programming
23:44 - by attending a program called
23:48 - ITP ITP is a two-year graduate program
23:51 - located in Tisch school the arts whose
23:52 - mission is to explore imagine of use of
23:54 - communications technologies guess what
23:56 - that's the program where I teach now I
23:57 - was a student there from 2001 to 2003
24:01 - JT nimoy came and did a workshop on
24:04 - processing and that's and processing
24:07 - started appearing more at ITP then and
24:10 - that's where I discovered it and I just
24:12 - kind of never left ITP and started
24:15 - working on open source things and
24:17 - honestly here's the thing with this
24:20 - question which is how did you get into
24:24 - teaching and writing for me I never
24:26 - actively applied for anything or decided
24:30 - this is what I was going to do I just
24:33 - started putting exec you know I would
24:36 - make stuff and then put examples online
24:37 - and put a blog post online about the
24:40 - example and through doing that then
24:42 - people would find it and and so just
24:46 - sort of the act of always kind of
24:51 - release early release often with just
24:53 - anything that I was doing kind of
24:55 - snowballed into just doing more and more
24:57 - of that and discovering that one of the
24:59 - things I enjoyed doing more was teaching
25:02 - and making examples then making actual
25:04 - projects are doing kind of freelance
25:05 - coding work itself so that's kind of how
25:08 - it happened okay okay
25:14 - so no I did not go from student to
25:17 - teacher in two years
25:19 - ITP has positions that are called are
25:22 - like research residences that I did
25:24 - after I graduated and I did workshops
25:26 - and things as part of that and then
25:28 - maybe I taught one class it was sort of
25:30 - a slowish process okay I'll try it up
25:33 - maybe what I'll try to do is come back
25:35 - and answer some of these questions by
25:37 - typing it's pathetic I know later okay
25:43 - so I don't know if this went well my
25:45 - attempt to answer questions okay but
25:48 - let's let's take a look at glitch let's
25:49 - see if this is a viable option for doing
25:53 - a coding challenge I sort of feel like
25:56 - if I'm to use glitch do I really want
25:57 - the the usually issue
26:00 - there's nothing about what I'm doing
26:02 - today
26:03 - that requires server-side programming um
26:07 - you know you know I could add stuff like
26:10 - a high score list and things like that
26:12 - but I'm not so but let's take a look at
26:14 - this for a little bit now I have a
26:15 - glitch account
26:16 - Oh sign-in with git oh boy okay hold on
26:18 - do you think we can manage this you bear
26:21 - with me for a second you know what okay
26:26 - I'm gonna come back to glitch another
26:27 - time because it's already 11 a.m. I have
26:29 - been streaming for 27 minutes and I'm
26:35 - looking at the chat and so I think I
26:36 - need to get going let's let me put on
26:39 - some music
26:40 - so this is random this is your choice
26:43 - that is in the core random algorithm the
26:46 - actual random algorithm itself those
26:48 - numbers aren't related at all you pick
26:51 - like I'm picking random numbers between
26:53 - zero and ten nine two seven six one
26:58 - things I need to do is get the
27:00 - whiteboard ready really
27:01 - but with curly noise I might pick
27:03 - numbers like this two three four so
27:06 - minesweeper I have to think about this
27:08 - five six seven eight nine what do I need
27:14 - for my
27:17 - [Music]
28:00 - this will be so hard
28:14 - let's see okay so let's get going here
28:17 - we're gonna do my ridiculous thing where
28:20 - oh this is by the way wonderful project
28:22 - called superwoman it's made by Qian Tian
28:26 - Yi I'm apologizing sick John Khan if I
28:29 - mispronounced her name I love this
28:34 - project it's so lovely it's so
28:36 - satisfying to watch these little
28:39 - characters fly as you hover your mouse
28:41 - over them okay but the reason why I'm
28:43 - here on the p5.js website is to download
28:47 - the entire forces 7th time because I am
28:52 - a ridiculous person and now I'm gonna
28:54 - get empty example and I'm going to put
28:58 - it on the desktop and I'm going to call
29:01 - it now
29:02 - minesweeper now here's the thing I like
29:05 - I like to I'm gonna do some sort of
29:07 - little my audio is quiet relative than
29:11 - music is that correct okay let's let me
29:14 - let's let's let's confirm this as always
29:17 - I always forget to this stop I'm talking
29:19 - it's done and music is play
29:22 - I'm talking and you skip plays how is
29:27 - the volume of my voice as compared I
29:36 - can't hear the music so what's to loud
29:54 - sounds fine to me it's perfect okay
29:56 - great
29:59 - all right so now what am I going to do I
30:04 - I'm gonna chicken out about the glitch
30:07 - thing I'm gonna come back to that
30:12 - especially one side once once I'm
30:14 - sponsor hey what happened to my oh oh
30:21 - how interesting
30:23 - now when you download the example it
30:26 - doesn't come with the libraries that
30:28 - come is a little it just links to the
30:30 - CDN that's fine and the min yes that's
30:33 - fine okay let's take this off okay and
30:40 - let's go to the brats let's run a little
30:43 - server by the way I had a strawpoll up
30:50 - about let's check this one out by the
30:54 - way oh yeah I had a strawpoll up as to
30:57 - whether people preferred me to do this
30:58 - in JavaScript or Java and seems like the
31:03 - I would like to do more coding
31:05 - challenges and things in processing
31:09 - good morning oh I'm so glad to be back
31:12 - here on the coding train in the morning
31:14 - I'm playing in the background a new song
31:17 - by somebody it is called the k-nearest
31:26 - neighbor remix by third culture records
31:29 - i guess it's from the latest live stream
31:33 - i'm having trouble talking with this
31:34 - music on so welcome my name is Dan I
31:37 - hope that I'm live streaming I hope that
31:38 - everyone can hear me I'm checking some
31:40 - chat things going and okay it is live
31:44 - okay great
31:45 - so this is the coding train good my name
31:49 - is Dan Schiffman and I am here most
31:52 - Fridays almost every Friday often in the
31:54 - late afternoon but I'm here this morning
31:55 - it is now the end of the semester at New
31:59 - York University next week
32:01 - if you happen to be in the New York City
32:02 - area my students have a show of all
32:04 - their work Tuesday and Wednesday
32:07 - here at 721 Broadway so there's a lot of
32:10 - stuff going on for setting up for that
32:11 - that I'm doing this afternoon and so I'm
32:14 - here this morning instead so what's
32:17 - what's happening well look at all the
32:20 - board to to to all sorts of stuff okay
32:22 - nobody's complaining this yo this
32:25 - slightly strange invisible bug is back
32:30 - so I have a bunch of things that I want
32:32 - to discuss and go over and do and I good
32:39 - morning oh I'm so glad to be back here
32:41 - on the coding train in the morning I'm
32:43 - playing in the background a new song by
32:47 - somebody
32:50 - [Music]
32:52 - it is called the k-nearest neighbor
32:55 - remix by third culture records
32:58 - I guess it's from the latest live stream
33:01 - I'm having trouble talking with this
33:03 - music on so welcome my name is Dan I
33:06 - hope that I'm live streaming I hope that
33:07 - everyone can hear me I'm checking some
33:09 - chat things going and okay it is live
33:13 - okay great so this is the coding train
33:16 - turd my name is Dan Schiffman and I am
33:19 - here most Friday's almost every Friday
33:22 - often in the late afternoon but I'm here
33:24 - this morning it is now the end of the
33:26 - semester at New York University next
33:29 - week if you happen to be in the New York
33:31 - City area my students have a show of all
33:33 - their work Tuesday and Wednesday
33:36 - here at 721 Broadway so there's a lot of
33:39 - stuff going on for setting up for that
33:40 - that I'm doing this afternoon and so I'm
33:43 - here this morning instead so what's
33:46 - what's happening well look at all the
33:49 - board - - - all sorts of stuff okay
33:51 - nobody's complaining this yath is
33:54 - slightly strange invisible bug is back
33:58 - so I have a bunch of things that I want
34:01 - to discuss and go over and do and I
34:05 - think I've already forgotten what all
34:07 - those things are Oh does it say special
34:11 - Thursday episode in the let me fix that
34:14 - [Music]
34:17 - every I'm gonna change this to say every
34:19 - Friday okay should save that now so
34:24 - first of all to the young fellow who
34:28 - stopped me in Union Square this morning
34:29 - it said hey are you coding rainbow hello
34:32 - I doubt you're actually watching but
34:34 - that was like a lot of fun that somebody
34:36 - actually stopped me in the subway at
34:38 - Union Square to ask if I was coding
34:40 - rainbow and first of all a couple things
34:41 - number one is as much as I would like to
34:43 - be I am NOT physically a rainbow though
34:46 - I am close to one perhaps maybe and also
34:52 - it's the coding train now no more coding
34:55 - rainbow sadly okay so a blue boys 79 who
35:02 - has two exams
35:03 - tomorrow you should probably go study
35:05 - for those exams okay let's put back on I
35:07 - realized I forgot to do something here
35:09 - which I need to do I'm gonna put back on
35:11 - the actually go before I do that let me
35:14 - mention something so I'm trying a new
35:16 - experiment rying to figure out all sorts
35:18 - of different ways to interact with the
35:20 - audience and some of you know that I
35:23 - have a patron group I'm using a
35:26 - crowdfunding site called patreon calm if
35:28 - you go to patreon patreon calm slash
35:32 - coding train you are welcome to
35:34 - participate and contribute in this and
35:36 - you'll get an invite to a slack channel
35:37 - which I am NOT looking at but I'm going
35:39 - to look at right now nobody's put any
35:41 - messages in this like channel but there
35:43 - it is actually there are some from
35:45 - earlier but not since I started okay but
35:47 - I've take questions on Twitter and I
35:49 - have this like github repository of
35:50 - trying all sorts of different things
35:51 - something that I thought I would try
35:52 - that someone suggested there is a coding
35:55 - train subreddit that somebody created
35:58 - and I put there a question thread for
36:01 - Friday May 12th at 10:30 a.m. so here is
36:05 - where you could I'm going to if this
36:07 - goes well I'll do this every week I will
36:09 - people can post their questions and then
36:12 - up vote them so what did I have for
36:14 - breakfast I'm going to upload this oops
36:17 - oh I'm not signed in can I do it is it
36:19 - what's the chance I'm gonna actually
36:21 - know my password to sign in to read it
36:23 - wow that was really lucky okay
36:26 - I'm gonna upload this question oops and
36:29 - then I am going to answer it what did I
36:33 - have for breakfast I had some granola
36:37 - with some almond milk and a banana
36:40 - that's what I have okay so while I'm
36:49 - talking and wasting time if any of you
36:52 - want to go and add some questions or
36:54 - upload any questions I'll come back to
36:56 - this in a moment
36:57 - okay let me do something that that I
37:01 - need to high shine I love those emojis
37:05 - so baltimore papa pistachio guess who is
37:09 - from the great city of baltimore go Oh's
37:14 - me
37:15 - that's where I grew up I was not born in
37:17 - Baltimore I was born in New Haven
37:19 - Connecticut little fact there when I was
37:22 - 4 weeks old I moved to Baltimore other
37:25 - interesting tidbits here we go okay I
37:34 - forgot something very important which is
37:38 - my green paper check it used for my
37:43 - strange conductors hat the only reason
37:46 - that the thing is I kind of want to wear
37:48 - this but it's doesn't have green in it
37:52 - but I guess this particular shade of
37:53 - blue it kind of gets keyed out so it's
37:56 - got this weird invisible head thing but
37:58 - maybe I'll wear it for the beginning of
37:59 - this okay ready all aboard here we are I
38:06 - was coding trade I'm going to do a
38:08 - coding challenge today that was
38:09 - requested highly requested the number
38:11 - three requested topic minesweeper thank
38:16 - you to fire soul who suggested this on
38:19 - August 14th 2016 today is May 12th 2017
38:22 - so I didn't get to it within a year and
38:25 - I have never programmed this before and
38:28 - I think probably last time I played
38:30 - minesweeper was big it's got to be at
38:32 - least 15 years ago but I do know how it
38:34 - works so I'm just gonna get started
38:36 - let's see I expect this is probably
38:38 - gonna take if I can do this in under 60
38:40 - minutes that's gonna be good for me you
38:42 - could see how long this video is I don't
38:43 - even know because I am at the present
38:46 - time right now okay I've no idea what's
38:50 - gonna happen next but I'm just gonna get
38:52 - started okay what are some things I need
38:54 - to do here I have to do this okay first
39:01 - thing that I need to do is I think what
39:04 - I should do is I should make an object I
39:06 - should make an object called a cell
39:10 - let's think about this
39:12 - so minesweeper and by the way I'm gonna
39:15 - well minesweeper I want to use something
39:18 - besides bombs so i beez and bombs on
39:21 - twitter suggested why not B's so I like
39:23 - this idea of what we're gonna do is make
39:25 - beasts
39:26 - we're the idea here is there's a grid
39:29 - and any one of these cells could either
39:32 - have a bee in it or nothing in it so the
39:37 - cell should have a state and we could
39:41 - think of that state as like B maybe it's
39:43 - true or false so each cell will have a
39:48 - state true or false
39:49 - each cell might I might need to know
39:52 - like where it is and its width and
39:55 - height it's kind of redundant
39:56 - information but that's kind of useful
39:58 - good I need to know where to draw it and
40:01 - then I also want to know its state like
40:05 - has it been revealed or not so that's
40:07 - also I can actually think of that as a
40:09 - boolean revealed true or false so right
40:15 - because if it's revealed I'll see what's
40:17 - there
40:18 - it could be blank if nothing's there or
40:20 - the B if the B is there or it could also
40:23 - have a number so for example this cell
40:26 - would have the number 2 because it's got
40:29 - to be xed to it this cell would also
40:32 - have the number 2 because it has to be
40:34 - xed to it this would have a 1 a 1 a 1 a
40:38 - 1 a 2 a 2 A 1 a 1 so if it's revealed we
40:43 - either see blank or B or a number okay
40:51 - so I think this is kind of all we need
40:54 - this is gonna be really hard so you take
40:57 - me a very long time because what I was
40:58 - about feels like God it'll be easy it'll
41:00 - be done ten minutes which is never true
41:02 - it's especially not for me back okay
41:05 - okay so I'm gonna come back to the
41:07 - computer now and let's let's add some of
41:11 - these things this dot B equals true this
41:19 - dot revealed equals true so let's just
41:23 - pretend for a moment that every single
41:25 - cell has a B and is revealed so now what
41:30 - do I want to do here I need to store all
41:32 - of these cells in some sort of data
41:35 - structure now there's a variety of ways
41:38 - I could do this
41:40 - I could whatever probably makes sense
41:43 - for me to store them in a two
41:45 - dimensional so-called two-dimensional
41:47 - array and so we could think of this as
41:49 - like oh this every single cell is going
41:52 - to be in a big array so it's a list but
41:56 - inside that array maybe each row is also
42:00 - an array that way what this allows me to
42:04 - do is if I want to say if I call this
42:06 - maybe I'll call this the grid if I
42:08 - reference grid index one a comma 2 comma
42:17 - 3 or something so this is Z this is row
42:20 - 0 this is Row 1 and then column I would
42:25 - have this or something so that would be
42:27 - that particular cell and I wouldn't
42:28 - write it like this I would write it like
42:31 - this so I think this makes sense I could
42:34 - use a just a regular array and then I
42:36 - could always convert a column and row
42:38 - location to the spot and the one
42:40 - dimensional array and I've done this
42:41 - quite a bit in different videos about
42:43 - pixels and image processing but I think
42:45 - this makes sense the only thing that's a
42:46 - little bit weird is typically when I do
42:48 - this I actually think about this as the
42:51 - column and this is the row kind of like
42:53 - X comma Y column row and the way I just
42:56 - described it here these so so really
42:58 - what I might do is like this is the FIR
43:00 - the first column is the first element
43:02 - then the next column is the second
43:04 - element of that array so there's any
43:06 - number of ways you could sort of think
43:07 - of this or do this but I'm gonna do this
43:09 - here and in the code now now it's a
43:11 - little bit tricky in JavaScript to make
43:13 - a two-dimensional array and what I'm
43:15 - actually gonna do is I'm gonna make a
43:17 - function I'm gonna call it make make 2d
43:22 - array I've done this before I have like
43:24 - a total deja vu moment here I've done
43:26 - this in a previous coding challenge and
43:28 - actually I think there's a github issue
43:30 - thread on the rainbow topics forum
43:32 - github repository about how to make a
43:34 - Eric function that makes you any
43:36 - dimensional array but let's just say I
43:38 - make a 2-dimensional array with a
43:39 - certain number of columns and a certain
43:42 - number of rows and so I'm going to say
43:44 - array equals a new array with a certain
43:48 - number of columns and then for
43:52 - every column make that an array with the
44:04 - number of rows in it okay so I have an
44:07 - array of all the columns which are all
44:10 - like the X's and then each one of those
44:11 - is an array of all the rows of all the
44:14 - Y's and this is a you know in JavaScript
44:16 - typically you'll see this right which is
44:19 - like that's how you make an array but I
44:21 - can I can also say if I want the array
44:23 - to have a specific number of elements to
44:24 - start I can say new array number of
44:26 - columns okay so what I want to do is now
44:29 - I'm gonna have a global variable called
44:30 - grid and I'm gonna say grid equals make
44:35 - 2d array with now how many columns and
44:39 - how many rows all right so let's just do
44:42 - something simple here let's just say
44:44 - that these are gonna be ten by ten these
44:47 - are gonna be ten ten by ten pick little
44:50 - ten by ten pixel right squares so if my
44:54 - canvas is 400 by 400 then I'm gonna have
44:57 - forty columns and 40 rows okay so that
45:01 - let's do that so I'm gonna make uh so
45:03 - first I have to say let's make create
45:05 - canvas width of 400 comma 400 and let's
45:12 - make it smaller just to start 200 comma
45:14 - 200 and then make the grid make the make
45:17 - an array of two honey
45:18 - 20 by 20 and I'm gonna okay and you know
45:22 - I could use math to clean this up later
45:24 - we'll do that later okay this is fun
45:27 - this isn't feel so fun yet maybe look at
45:29 - soon enough so now and actually let's
45:33 - have a global variable like let's just
45:35 - do this and now I'm going to say for VAR
45:41 - i equals 0 i is less than a number of
45:44 - columns i now need to initialize and
45:48 - then I'm going to use J for the number
45:51 - of rows and now I need to just
45:56 - initialize every single spot to be a new
45:59 - cell so what we've got now here is this
46:04 - idea of okay we need
46:06 - have the game the board the game board
46:08 - is a grid of cell objects it's going to
46:11 - have a certain number of columns and a
46:12 - certain number of roll rows so I make a
46:14 - two-dimensional array to store all the
46:16 - cells and then I loop through for every
46:18 - column for every row make a new cell now
46:24 - let's go into the draw function let's
46:27 - say background zero and do this and I'm
46:32 - gonna say show okay this is going to
46:37 - actually be an edit point because I just
46:39 - hate what the camera goes off but
46:40 - otherwise I'm not going to do any entity
46:46 - let's say show okay so the idea here now
46:51 - is I want to be able to see what's in
46:53 - these cells so I need to go and you know
46:56 - what I really want to do I'm gonna make
46:58 - a separate JavaScript file called cell
47:00 - yes because I have a feeling ultimately
47:03 - there's gonna be a lot of code that
47:05 - starts going into the cell so I'd like
47:07 - to save that somewhere else and once
47:09 - I've done that I just need to make sure
47:10 - I also add a reference to it in my
47:13 - index.html file okay whoops what's going
47:17 - on cannot read properties 0 of undefined
47:19 - sketch such as 25 so we already have an
47:21 - error here what Seve let's get touch
47:33 - hiss 22 mmm
47:36 - what do I have now what's wrong oh look
47:39 - at this you know it would be nice if I
47:41 - write a function called make 2d array
47:43 - and I create a two-dimensional array you
47:45 - know what I need to do I need to return
47:47 - it so return the array okay great now
47:51 - show is not a function ok great so now
47:54 - we need to write a function called show
47:57 - and I'm gonna attach the functions to
48:00 - the prototype this is up this is a one a
48:04 - way of doing object-oriented programming
48:05 - in JavaScript where I create use this
48:07 - constructor function to make an object
48:09 - and every object that is made with that
48:12 - constructor function will have a set of
48:13 - methods as part of its prototype one of
48:16 - which is show another video that covers
48:17 - to this more clear or another
48:20 - they covered this in more detail which I
48:21 - will link to in the description and also
48:23 - someday maybe I'll use this yes six
48:26 - syntax which is a little bit different
48:28 - and perhaps a bit nicer remains to be
48:30 - seen
48:31 - okay so now what I want to do is I want
48:33 - to draw a rectangle at the X location we
48:40 - have a source with a width and height
48:42 - that's the size of the rectangle of each
48:44 - cell huh but it doesn't have this cell
48:48 - doesn't have an X a Y or a size so let's
48:51 - give it that X Y w this dot x equals x
48:57 - this dot y equals y this w equals W now
49:00 - when I create each cell if I have a
49:04 - global variable called W which is ten
49:09 - each cell is going to be a 10 by 10
49:11 - pixel thing let's make it 20 by 20 to
49:14 - make it bigger then I can also say right
49:17 - I can actually then calculate the number
49:20 - of columns and rows which is the width
49:23 - divided by that size the rows is the
49:27 - height divided by that size and probably
49:31 - what I should also do is say floor
49:33 - because I don't want to have like 21.3
49:39 - columns or 21.7 rows it needs to be a
49:43 - whole number an integer value so let's
49:46 - see how are we doing here now that I've
49:47 - done that I can make each cell at its I
49:52 - times W location or it's J times W
49:55 - location so why is that right so each
49:57 - one of these basically has let me find
50:00 - my eraser here each one of these has a I
50:10 - index its column it also has a J index
50:16 - it's row so if this one is 2 comma 1
50:20 - it's actually the rectangle itself if
50:23 - each one of these is 10 by 10 would be
50:26 - at 20 comma 10 pixels if it's 20 by 20
50:28 - okay 40 comma 20 so we need to calculate
50:31 - its pixel location
50:33 - by multiplying by taking the its index I
50:36 - comma J and expanding it by the number
50:38 - of pixels which is the size yay-yay me
50:41 - and setting the grid size things okay so
50:45 - now and its size is just W so again some
50:49 - funny me you know nothing on this is
50:51 - really going to change does it need to
50:52 - be in the object could just be a global
50:53 - variable but what the hey here we go
50:56 - okay so now we should be able to see a
51:00 - whole bunch of rectangles now look at
51:04 - this that's sort of sad like they have
51:06 - this what am i what's going on here so
51:08 - let's figure out what we're gonna color
51:10 - then I'm gonna say stroke common zero
51:13 - and no fill let's do that now we see
51:17 - nothing I'm gonna say fill comma 255 now
51:23 - we see the outline and but it's kind of
51:26 - sad like our math is off this these
51:29 - little details really pause for me so
51:31 - let's fix this what's the best way to do
51:35 - it I don't know this might this might
51:39 - just actually work that's fine let's do
51:41 - it that way so just actually make the
51:43 - canvas one pixel wider everything's
51:45 - happy now okay so now we see that grid
51:47 - now here's the thing what I want to say
51:50 - in the show function is you know if if
51:56 - it's not revealed
52:00 - well actually it's always gonna I think
52:02 - we're always going to draw a white
52:04 - rectangle you know what actually what I
52:07 - should do this will make more sense is I
52:09 - should make the background white and I'm
52:13 - always going to draw a no filled a no
52:17 - filled rectangle and if it is revealed
52:22 - then I might put some other things in it
52:24 - for example if it's a B then let's draw
52:28 - I don't know what I'm just gonna draw an
52:32 - ellipse and so I'm gonna draw a little
52:41 - circle if it's a B let's see what
52:44 - happens there okay whoops but this
52:45 - circles in the wrong place because but I
52:48 - can change that I could say ellipse mode
52:51 - corner so I can have the ellipse
52:53 - reference point be the corner oh but I
52:57 - want it to be I want it to appear in the
52:59 - center so never mind
53:01 - I'm gonna make its location plus W so
53:06 - I'm gonna just draw in a little ellipse
53:07 - I'm just kind of moving the ellipse
53:09 - around so if it's a B there's a circle
53:11 - there they all have a B so let's now do
53:16 - something different let's just say if
53:18 - random 1 is less than 0.5 then this dot
53:24 - B is true otherwise this dot B is false
53:28 - so now half of them are about how about
53:31 - half of them randomly are going to be
53:33 - bees and there we go so now we see we're
53:35 - on our way to actually making this game
53:38 - okay so we now have a setup where we
53:42 - have a grid each cell has a stake it
53:45 - could be a B or not a B and we can
53:47 - visualize that B design aside okay so
53:52 - now I should say that there none of them
53:54 - are revealed at the beginning none of
53:55 - them are revealed right tada
53:58 - so now here's the thing now what I need
54:01 - to do what we're really moving along
54:03 - here we don't have too much farther to
54:06 - go
54:06 - now what I need to do is I need some
54:09 - mechanism to just say like when I click
54:12 - on one of these I want to reveal it I
54:16 - want to show what's underneath click on
54:19 - it
54:19 - reveal it so now what I need to do is I
54:22 - need some sort of function to determine
54:25 - if the mouse has clicked on that
54:27 - particular cell so one way to do that
54:30 - first of all would be to write a
54:32 - function contains XY so in other words I
54:38 - want to this is a function I want to be
54:41 - able to say does this cell contain a
54:46 - point is that point inside this cell and
54:49 - so what are the boundaries of the cell
54:52 - well if X is greater than this X plus
54:58 - this out X
54:59 - and X is less than this dot X plus this
55:04 - dot W right because if that Newt look
55:07 - right if this is a cell I want to know
55:11 - did the mouse is this point between X
55:14 - and X plus W or is it between y and y
55:20 - plus W and I'm using W as this generic
55:23 - variable named width and since these are
55:25 - all squares the width and height are
55:27 - equal I you know I would have to rethink
55:30 - this and perhaps if I was things were
55:33 - different but and maybe there's a better
55:35 - variable name for this but W for this
55:38 - the sort of length of a side of the
55:40 - rectangle okay so what I can actually do
55:42 - here and I don't need to actually have
55:44 - this if statement I just want to return
55:45 - the result of this a point is inside if
55:48 - X is between the boundaries and this is
55:51 - gonna get very long Y is between the
55:54 - boundaries so the same old thing right
56:02 - so return this long the result
56:05 - evaluating this long if statement return
56:07 - X being between the left and right and Y
56:10 - being between the top and bottom why am
56:13 - I doing this because what I also want to
56:18 - do now is handle the mouse pressed event
56:25 - so using p5 there's a global function
56:28 - called mousepressed where what I can do
56:30 - is I can say now I could say if grid
56:34 - contains Mouse X comma Mouse why I wrote
56:40 - that function because what I want to do
56:44 - is say let me check every single let me
56:47 - check every single spot in the grid to
56:49 - see if it contains when the mouse is
56:50 - pressed to see if it contains the mouse
56:52 - point if it does that's a point that
56:55 - I've clicked on and now I can do
56:56 - something about that I can say grid IJ
56:59 - reveal all right so I can execute a
57:03 - function like reveal so let me now go
57:06 - into the cell object and I can write a
57:07 - new function called reveal and here's
57:11 - the thing
57:13 - say this dot revealed equals true so
57:17 - even if I if I click on it before it's
57:20 - already true it's true so let's let's
57:22 - see how this works well that was weird
57:29 - so I must have mistakes unfair because
57:32 - I'm clicking on some so let's see here
57:34 - let's see where do I have a mistake I
57:36 - see somebody in the chat grid i J
57:39 - okay III whoops that's AI J and this was
57:43 - this is right this is right this is
57:45 - right okay I comma J there we go that
57:48 - should fix it so whoa what craziness is
57:51 - going on oh this is kind of a fun effect
57:55 - live if grid I comma J contains Mouse X
58:02 - and mouse Y and so okay let's look at my
58:05 - reveals function my contains function if
58:09 - X is greater than this dot X and X is
58:11 - less than this X plus y is greater than
58:14 - this not Y this looks right what have I
58:18 - missed here contains has an error
58:21 - clearly looking at this greater than X
58:29 - and less than X plus W did I not know
58:33 - I've set W Y is greater than this oh
58:37 - this is the mistake look at that so then
58:40 - I really it's the event the opposite of
58:43 - the usual this dot mistake and you know
58:46 - this is a bit of a problem this is a
58:48 - very common programming a headachy thing
58:51 - which is that these variables are the
58:56 - arguments to the function the parameters
58:58 - of the function they're coming in and
59:00 - I'm testing them against the objects own
59:03 - X&Y so the objects own x and y is this
59:06 - dot and the arguments that are coming in
59:08 - are x and y so this is where i don't
59:10 - want to this dot okay great
59:13 - so now we should see whenever I click on
59:16 - one now and and what I'm going to do
59:18 - here also just to be able to see that
59:20 - this is really working is where do I if
59:26 - there
59:26 - to be otherwise let's draw a like a gray
59:31 - rectangle and let's be let's be explicit
59:40 - about everything so let's sort of see
59:45 - here so now I'm just also whenever I
59:47 - click on it it will draw something so we
59:51 - can see oh and I should have you know we
59:56 - don't need to redo the stroke the stroke
59:58 - will always stay so we can see if
60:02 - there's a B there's a B circle if
60:05 - there's not there's a gray rectangle and
60:07 - I meant that for that to be much lighter
60:09 - so something like this so I just want to
60:11 - see that it's been clicked on okay great
60:14 - we're doing well now here's the thing
60:17 - the amazing thing is that somebody's
60:24 - somebody's giving me some good advice in
60:26 - the chat it's a better way than I could
60:28 - do this now here's the thing what do I
60:31 - also want I want to be able to determine
60:34 - how many bees are neighboring a
60:39 - particular cell so I need a function I'm
60:44 - gonna call it count neighbors and I
60:51 - wonder if that's something else yeah
60:53 - I'll just do it on the fly count
60:54 - neighbors equals a function okay so
60:58 - first I want to do is just say total is
61:01 - zero and maybe I could call this count
61:04 - bees or something so first of all if
61:09 - this cell is a bee return negative one
61:14 - let's just say if it's a bee return
61:16 - negative one because it's irrelevant I
61:18 - only want to count the number of bees
61:20 - next two cells that are bees
61:23 - now what I need to do is I need to look
61:26 - at all the neighbors well how do I look
61:28 - at all the neighbors a particular cell
61:32 - has how many neighbors one two three
61:37 - four five six seven eight
61:40 - and so actually I can do a little loop
61:42 - that's between an offset of negative one
61:46 - and an offset of +1 right I want to look
61:50 - at every neighbor that's minus one plus
61:52 - one I could do these each individually
61:54 - like just check each one but let's do it
61:55 - in a loop so what I want to say now is
62:04 - okay I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm
62:05 - thinking let's do for I equals negative
62:09 - 1 I is less than and/or let's say less
62:14 - than or equal to plus 1 i plus plus so i
62:19 - here is now the offset in the X
62:21 - Direction J equals negative 1 J is less
62:25 - than or equal to 1 J plus plus and so I
62:31 - want to look at a particular neighbor is
62:33 - a particular neighbor is grid oh look at
62:40 - this these keep track of their own x and
62:44 - y but don't keep track of their own
62:46 - index what do I want to do about this so
62:52 - this is really in some ways this
62:53 - function isn't really part of a cell or
62:57 - is it a grid function anyway there's a
63:00 - bunch of different ways I could do this
63:01 - I'm actually just gonna in a very
63:03 - redundant way whoops I'm going to this
63:08 - is just for total overkill nests and you
63:14 - know it actually I like this because you
63:17 - know what I could do is if I send the
63:18 - index into the grid then I could just
63:21 - calculate the x and y here because I
63:24 - could say it's I times W and the y is J
63:28 - times W so let's change how that works
63:30 - and let's go into sketch and let's
63:34 - change how this works so I could just
63:36 - make a new cell that's at I comma J
63:39 - comma W right because now what I can do
63:43 - here is I can say this dot I plus I this
63:52 - dot J
63:54 - this J plus J so these are all the
63:57 - neighbors I want to look at I want to
63:59 - look at I want to look at I minus 1 I I
64:05 - plus 1 hi
64:07 - I want to look at I plus 1 J minus 1 I
64:10 - want to look at every single neighbor
64:12 - from negative 1 to 1 okay like I don't
64:16 - know if this is if I'm totally being
64:17 - clear I want to say like I minus 1 comma
64:20 - J J minus 1 then I want to say you know
64:23 - I comma J minus 1 I I plus 1 J minus 1 I
64:29 - comma J right you know I comma J minus 1
64:32 - I comma J I comma u you can you know I
64:39 - said everything we could do any edits I
64:40 - don't know why I'm trying to list all
64:41 - the neighbors I think if you get out a
64:42 - piece of paper and draw it you'll be
64:44 - able to do it I got to keep moving we're
64:46 - gonna get this video finished okay so if
64:49 - neighbor dot B total plus plus okay so
65:02 - if if the neighbor has a beat increase
65:06 - that total and I guess I could say at
65:08 - the end now I return total now here's
65:11 - the thing I really don't want to check
65:14 - myself right because I'm not a neighbor
65:17 - for myself so whenever I equals whenever
65:21 - whenever I and J are both zero that
65:23 - offset is zero then I don't want to
65:25 - check but the thing is if I was a B I
65:27 - wouldn't be in here if I wasn't B I
65:30 - wouldn't be checking my neighbors in the
65:31 - first place so we can assume that I'm
65:33 - not to be so total even if neighbor is
65:35 - myself total won't go up so I can I can
65:37 - skip checking that so great so now I can
65:39 - return total so what I want to do and so
65:43 - here's the thing I think actually let's
65:47 - just create a variable which is
65:51 - neighboring called name neighbor count
65:57 - right I'm going to create a variable
65:59 - called neighbor count and when I do
66:01 - count bees instead of returning it I'm
66:04 - gonna say this dot neighbor count
66:07 - is a is that total because I think what
66:13 - I'm gonna do is after I create the whole
66:16 - grid I'm just gonna just gonna count
66:18 - every single one now the thing is I
66:24 - can't just call count neighbors here
66:26 - I've got to make the full grid because I
66:28 - can't count neighbors if I haven't made
66:31 - certain cells that are next to that one
66:33 - so you know I could just count the
66:35 - neighbors when I click on it but I might
66:36 - as well just count them all that way
66:38 - when I click on it what I can actually
66:40 - do here is in the display right where's
66:46 - my show function if it's a B it's got a
66:49 - circle if it's not I can also say text
66:55 - and let's say text-align:center
66:59 - text-align:center then I want to say
67:03 - text and then I wanna say fill 0 and
67:07 - then I want to say text neighbor count
67:10 - this dot X this dot Y and I'm sure I'm
67:14 - gonna have to move the text around and
67:15 - it should be this dot neighbor count
67:17 - okay how are we doing here now I know
67:19 - there's gonna be a problem
67:20 - but I'm gonna go for it anyway no I
67:23 - didn't have a problem yeah ok 0
67:26 - neighbors well first of all that's not
67:27 - right it's in the wrong place and it's
67:29 - the wrong number so something is going
67:32 - wrong but that's okay we're gonna figure
67:34 - this out okay so first of all it's in
67:37 - the Rosalie's fix where it is so let's
67:39 - let's move the text over so I'm gonna
67:47 - place it in the center and then so but
67:52 - it's in the center but it's kind of at
67:54 - the top so I want to actually place the
67:56 - text at the bottom maybe - like 2 pixels
68:00 - or something so let's do that and maybe
68:04 - let's make it minus 4 pixels this is
68:08 - obviously the most important thing 6
68:09 - pixels
68:12 - okay so this looks good of getting the
68:16 - numbers but I am not seeing the right
68:18 - number so it's not counting
68:20 - right number of neighbors so something
68:22 - is clearly wrong so first of all did I
68:24 - cook let's just let's just see here is
68:28 - is this actually be happening let's say
68:32 - console.log total so that didn't happen
68:39 - I thought I was counting all the bees oh
68:45 - look at this just a little typo when you
68:49 - call a function you've got to add the
68:51 - parentheses referencing just the
68:55 - function as a variable you don't need
68:57 - the parentheses the parentheses execute
68:58 - the function so I was missing that and
69:01 - it's not grid it's not a function okay
69:05 - count neighbors is not a function what
69:08 - do I have wrong here contains equals
69:12 - function count
69:13 - oh it's called count bees it also would
69:15 - be nice to to name to name function
69:19 - correctly count bees all right cannot
69:23 - read property zero of undefined aha
69:26 - I thought we might have a problem so
69:29 - what is the problem the issue is ah ok
69:32 - this is gonna be a little edit point
69:34 - here if I'm on an edge
69:44 - there's no neighbor to the left or
69:45 - there's no neighbor up to the top so
69:47 - only only cells that are not along the
69:50 - edge have all eight neighbors otherwise
69:52 - there's fewer neighbors and I've got to
69:54 - account for that so what I wanted to
69:57 - account for that there's a variety of
69:58 - ways I could do that let's go to this
70:02 - count bees function okay so what I'm
70:05 - actually gonna do is I'm gonna call this
70:06 - X off I'm gonna just rename these Y off
70:11 - oops X off so it's like the X offset and
70:14 - the y offset I think this will be a
70:16 - little bit clearer in terms of a
70:18 - variable name then what I want to do is
70:20 - I'm going to say hi equals this dot I
70:23 - plus X off and bar J equals this j+ y
70:30 - off so this is actually the neighbor is
70:33 - just that I
70:34 - comma J now so I want to break those out
70:36 - into separate variables because now what
70:39 - I can do is I can say as long as I is
70:42 - not equal to as long as I is greater
70:46 - than negative 1 and I is less than
70:50 - [Music]
70:52 - columns and J is greater than negative 1
70:56 - and J is less than rows then I can go
71:00 - forward and do this right so I want to
71:03 - I'm if it's something off the grid
71:05 - ignore it so hopefully this helps and
71:09 - now five whoa there are five B's next to
71:14 - this too so this looks let's just try to
71:18 - click a button and actually let me just
71:20 - reveal them all so we can see if this
71:24 - let me just turn true on so now there we
71:29 - go
71:29 - so is this right this looks right right
71:32 - this cell has three neighbors
71:35 - this one has four this one has three are
71:38 - they correct on the edges three so this
71:41 - looks good great awesome okay we're
71:45 - getting somewhere
71:46 - how long have I been doing this oh
71:49 - there's all this stuff happening in the
71:52 - chat that I'm not looking at okay okay
71:54 - okay let's go I think I think we're all
72:00 - just about ready to actually start
72:02 - making a game happen so we can start
72:07 - working on the game mechanic so here's
72:09 - the thing what I want to do now is
72:13 - minesweeper I think starts with a fixed
72:16 - number of mines or B's in this case so
72:19 - what I actually don't want to do now and
72:21 - everything's going to not be Abie to
72:24 - start this dot B equals false what I
72:28 - want to do is have a variable I'm going
72:31 - to call it something like total B's and
72:34 - we're going to start with ten B's so
72:37 - there'll be ten B's randomly placed and
72:40 - so now what I need to do is I need to
72:43 - pick ret ten random spots now here's the
72:45 - thing I could just pick a random I
72:48 - and J but I don't want to pick the same
72:51 - spot toy so I'm gonna do something a
72:52 - little bit goofy what I'm going to do is
72:58 - I'm going to add to set up an album for
73:02 - pic pic total bees bees spots so for VAR
73:07 - i equals zero eyes less than total bees
73:10 - i plus plus now what I was saying is I
73:13 - could pick and I'm going to use n here
73:17 - because I want it I could say var I
73:21 - equals floor random columns let's just
73:27 - start this way J equals floor random
73:32 - rows okay so I could just do this and
73:36 - then I'm gonna say grid I J dot B equals
73:40 - true so let's do this and let's uh let's
73:46 - go here and say let's set everything to
73:48 - be revealed so well okay so something I
73:53 - clearly did something wrong but they're
73:56 - all in the diagonal what typo do I have
73:58 - here I did I I again get I and J so one
74:03 - two three four five six seven eight nine
74:06 - ooh
74:06 - one two three four five six seven eight
74:09 - nine ten there's ten but I'm going to do
74:11 - this a bunch of times at some point it's
74:13 - going to pick the same spot twice and so
74:15 - there could be done so there's a variety
74:16 - of ways I could do this I could check is
74:18 - that already a B if not pick another
74:20 - spot but I'm gonna do it this way what
74:23 - I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say options is
74:27 - a new array and then I'm going to go
74:35 - through every possible spot so I'm going
74:40 - to do all the columns and all the rows
74:42 - and I'm going to say options dot push a
74:48 - a little array with I and J in it so I'm
74:53 - going to create an array that has every
74:55 - possible option in it and I just so you
74:57 - see it I'm gonna say console.log options
74:59 - and
75:01 - oops let me take out this console dot
75:06 - log that's in the count B's function I
75:08 - don't want that anymore I'm done with
75:10 - that so we can see this isn't how hard
75:14 - to look at we can see these are all all
75:18 - the spots right four come 0 4 comma 1 4
75:21 - comma 2 the reason why I'm doing this is
75:23 - now what I could do is where am i
75:28 - sketched what I could do is here instead
75:30 - of just picking a random column in row I
75:33 - could say index equals floor random
75:39 - options dot length so give me a random
75:43 - option and then VAR I equals index 0 VAR
75:53 - j equals index 1 so that option has an x
75:57 - has a column and row location in it
75:59 - so i can set that to be true and then
76:00 - what I can do is I could say options dot
76:04 - splice index comma 1 so this then
76:07 - deletes that spot so so so it's no
76:11 - longer an option and I probably could do
76:13 - that in one line of code because splice
76:15 - probably returns the one that your o
76:19 - index sorry sorry this is blue choice
76:26 - equals so the thing that I'm choosing
76:28 - well this is confusing right the index
76:31 - is the random index into the options
76:33 - array and then the column and row
76:36 - location is part of that choice so I
76:40 - probably could
76:48 - so then I'm deleting it so okay
76:52 - then and okay so now let's try this
76:55 - again and this seems to work and what
76:58 - I'm going to do interestingly enough so
77:01 - there's a way that we're gonna be able
77:02 - to check if this is actually working so
77:04 - what I want to actually do is let's just
77:06 - take this splice right up here because I
77:08 - have a feeling splice return to the one
77:11 - returns the one that you picked so
77:14 - that's a little bit nicer right so pick
77:16 - a random index take it out and delete it
77:18 - and then set that to be true so now
77:20 - whoops so it doesn't splice does not so
77:24 - that's fine okay
77:31 - so let's leave it this way and there we
77:32 - go now let's make sure this is really
77:33 - working what I'm gonna do is say total
77:37 - bees equals we have 20 by what is this
77:42 - 10 by 10 so let's make total bees 100
77:45 - there we go so we can see that's working
77:48 - if I had just it's it it was able to
77:50 - pick every single spot but again 10 get
77:53 - 10 total bees 20 we get 20 there we go
77:57 - okay that's good now I don't want to
78:00 - reveal anything and also the way
78:02 - minesweeper works
78:03 - design-wise is if it has no neighbors
78:06 - you actually don't see the zero so let's
78:09 - let's just change that in how it's
78:11 - drawing so where I where I have the show
78:15 - function is only draw the text if this
78:20 - dot neighbor count is greater than zero
78:23 - okay there we go so now we're seeing
78:28 - this is we're seeing the final result
78:31 - this is the end of the game right you're
78:33 - done we found all of the bees my numbers
78:38 - are wrong somebody in the chat is saying
78:39 - my numbers are wrong I think they're
78:41 - right look at this pop is what I want
78:44 - removes that element from the array but
78:46 - I thought pop you can't give it a
78:48 - specific index can you let's take a
78:52 - let's take our short little divergence
78:55 - digression sorry and look at pop
78:57 - JavaScript array
79:01 - so does pop-pop I don't think yet it
79:08 - only removes the last element of the
79:10 - array so I can't give it a specific
79:11 - index anyway I could shuffle the array
79:14 - and then pop him off the end but
79:16 - whatever there's lots of other ways you
79:18 - could do this this is my way I did it
79:22 - no copyright violation here okay if I
79:26 - just think 1 if I sing incredibly poorly
79:29 - one line from song do I really violates
79:31 - copyright I don't think so okay so now
79:36 - let's now go back to cell and nothing is
79:40 - revealed false so now when we do is I
79:43 - can start playing like so what one okay
79:48 - so this is actually working in the sense
79:50 - that I can play this but when I click on
79:55 - one of these if it has no neighbors it
79:59 - should reveal everything around it that
80:03 - doesn't have this is the one tricky part
80:11 - alert alert train helps thing pull into
80:16 - station this is the trickiest part okay
80:21 - I need to figure out a way to reveal all
80:26 - the adjacent cells that don't have a B
80:29 - and if any of those adjacent cells also
80:32 - have a count of 0 all of the adjacent
80:35 - cells next to those should also be
80:38 - revealed so how do I do that well where
80:40 - where do I need to start this okay oh
80:44 - yeah this is basically flood-fill
80:45 - someone is saying flood fill this is
80:50 - like a flood fill algorithm because what
80:51 - I'm and maybe I'll come back to that the
80:53 - end Google flood fill I think we're kind
80:55 - of doing that all of a sudden which is
80:57 - exciting embedded in this video here
80:59 - okay so flood film from Wikipedia also
81:05 - called fills an algorithm determines the
81:07 - area connected to a given node okay I
81:09 - have the chat message one way too
81:11 - quickly okay now
81:14 - um let's see here so I'm not gonna look
81:17 - it up how it works I'm just gonna make
81:18 - up my own way of doing this so we're
81:21 - okay so this okay let's trace out what's
81:25 - going on here when I click the mouse I
81:29 - call reveal when I call reveal I said
81:36 - this dot revealed equal to true now what
81:39 - do I want to do different things so if
81:43 - this dot neighbor count equals zero
81:48 - flood-fill time it's flood-fill time
81:52 - doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo it's
81:55 - time how could you better but anyway so
82:00 - okay so now what I need to do is I need
82:03 - to go and look at all of the neighbors
82:05 - now we've done this before so what I
82:10 - think what I should do is I should
82:12 - probably call a function which is going
82:14 - to we'll call it this dot flood-fill
82:20 - because we might need to call this
82:22 - somewhat recursively cell dot prototype
82:27 - dot flood-fill equals function okay so
82:32 - one thing we need to do just like we did
82:34 - with neighbor count we can repurpose
82:36 - some of this code we can start to look
82:43 - at all the neighbors right so oops am i
82:49 - missing I'm missing a bracket okay so
82:51 - this was the code that looks at all the
82:53 - neighbors and it should reveal them all
82:58 - so ah this is perfect all I got to do is
83:00 - say this as long as it's not a B right
83:03 - if so okay I missed the one important
83:08 - I'm like thinking this through and I'm
83:09 - not able to say what I'm thinking right
83:13 - so has this work right we want to look
83:15 - at all the neighbors if the neighbor is
83:18 - not a B reveal it that's actually it's
83:20 - as simple as that if the neighbor is not
83:23 - a B neighbor dot reveal
83:27 - this is actually going to trigger
83:31 - because reveal is going to set that
83:33 - equal to true and it's gonna check
83:37 - reveal it's gonna set the neighbors
83:40 - reveal true and I have it flood fill if
83:41 - it's zero so it's gonna be redundancy
83:45 - here because it's gonna end up checking
83:47 - some spots but let's just see let's just
83:49 - see if this isn't really as simple as
83:51 - that
83:51 - I can't imagine okay something went
83:54 - wrong there clearly so first of all I
83:57 - clicked on a B okay that kind of worked
84:00 - but I got some errors here I think I'm
84:02 - getting close
84:03 - Oh maximum call stack size exceeded aha
84:07 - I also don't want to reveal it if it's
84:10 - already been revealed got it
84:12 - if neighbor is not a B and neighbor is
84:16 - not revealed right I don't otherwise I'm
84:20 - gonna be stuck in an infinite loop of
84:22 - like this neighbor oh I'm right because
84:25 - if I say to my neighbor reveal yourself
84:27 - and then my neighbor says hey you reveal
84:28 - yourself and I say no you reveal
84:30 - yourself I say know yourself everybody
84:33 - reveal themselves you you get to reveal
84:35 - yourself then we've got a problem
84:37 - okay so this that should help there's
84:39 - still some okay that's a one that's a
84:42 - one haha that was exciting
84:46 - okay okay
84:51 - I know what's going on when I click on a
84:52 - be something weird happens so it seems
84:59 - to be working unless I click on a B
85:01 - right why is it I what
85:05 - yeah so that's this this that's working
85:07 - really really well so why is it doing it
85:11 - when I click on a B so let's trace that
85:13 - out when I click on a B now suppressed I
85:20 - call reveal then in the reveal function
85:27 - if neighbor count equals zero this stuff
85:32 - so is neighbor counts zero when I click
85:34 - on a B shouldn't neighbor count be
85:36 - negative one when I click on a B why are
85:39 - other things being
85:40 - yield so let's do console dot log this
85:44 - dot neighbor count to see what's going
85:47 - on here 1 2 2 1 1 find me you want
85:55 - there's got to be this has got to be it
85:56 - here right 0 so it did get 0 and then
86:03 - why did it do anything else what am I
86:06 - missing
86:11 - right shouldn't dad have just have ended
86:14 - what else happens when it's a be it
86:22 - let's get out of the loop here that's
86:28 - not the issue
86:29 - I'm confused when you click on it be
86:34 - returned negative 1 but I but where am i
86:42 - returning something hmm it uses its if
86:51 - but I don't see why wouldn't this just
86:54 - finish returning negative 1 not
86:59 - assigning it to it Oh am I oh I return
87:03 - negative 1 here of course there we go
87:08 - yeah so if this dot B this neighbor
87:12 - count equals negative 1 and then I'll
87:18 - just say return ok that mean if that's
87:21 - what my problem I had - historically
87:24 - there we go I can keep playing hey I
87:27 - think we made my sleeper okay so now
87:31 - hold on if it's a B then the game is
87:35 - over
87:36 - ok haha how long have I been doing this
87:39 - somebody tell me how long this has been
87:40 - going on for ok ok ok
87:45 - wait wait wait all right low battery on
87:48 - my sound board everything's going
87:49 - everything's falling apart ok
87:53 - so here reveal if it contains so I could
87:58 - just check you know if it wasn't why
88:00 - don't we just check it here if grid
88:04 - i J J dot B game let's call game over so
88:14 - if it's a B if that spot is a B let's
88:18 - call a function called game over and in
88:21 - the game over function which I will put
88:25 - ran arbitrarily here what I'm going to
88:32 - do is loop through everything and just
88:36 - reveal everything reveal equals true so
88:39 - that's how I'm gonna have game over okay
88:45 - so I think we've made this game now
88:55 - oh shoot did I not hit save
89:02 - wah-wah if grid what did it happen grid
89:13 - IJ reveal is not a function what I mean
89:16 - it's not a function what did I do
89:19 - I've lost I've lost my Oh markers
89:26 - markers there's the thing where you
89:28 - could do markers okay okay hold on we're
89:30 - gonna well I'll add that maybe hold on
89:32 - yeah markers will be an exercise for the
89:35 - audience what's wrong here if it's a B
89:40 - well let me just run this again what did
89:53 - I do
89:55 - what have I done Oh reveal revealed
90:00 - revealed revealed revealed revealed not
90:05 - reveal the function this is one of the
90:06 - tricky things in JavaScript you can't
90:08 - have a variable I mean functions are
90:11 - variables so you can't say reveal equals
90:14 - five function reveal equals some
90:15 - function they're the same you've over
90:17 - written what you done that my variable
90:18 - name was revealed okay
90:25 - ah game over so I think that we have now
90:34 - made minesweeper about 50 this would be
90:38 - about 50 minutes I'm under an hour
90:40 - I mean minesweeper faster and it took me
90:42 - to make pong now I you know having the
90:46 - game just start having the game start
90:48 - over being able to add markers so being
90:50 - able to add markers is a way I think
90:52 - that you could like snow that you know
90:55 - there's a bomb there which is going to
90:56 - help you as you move along but I'm gonna
90:59 - finish this coding challenge I'm gonna
91:02 - leave that as an exercise so this is
91:04 - going to get posted you will see the
91:07 - code for it on github in a link that
91:10 - look in this video's description for the
91:11 - code those should be a readme file there
91:13 - as well where if you make a variation of
91:15 - this you can link to it maybe you could
91:17 - design some beautiful beze it could have
91:19 - sounds and one thing that you could do
91:21 - that would be really nice is you could
91:23 - animate the flood-fill algorithm so one
91:25 - thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
91:26 - just so we I'm gonna have a total number
91:28 - bees make it just 2 right now so when I
91:31 - click it flood fills it instantly but I
91:35 - could animate like just one at a time
91:37 - each frame reveal the next set of
91:39 - neighbors that would be an exciting nice
91:41 - little thing to do what other kinds of
91:43 - clever variations on the game can you
91:45 - make how can you make it more beautiful
91:47 - could you use some sort of weird
91:49 - hexagonal grid there's all sorts of
91:51 - possible ways you could improve and
91:54 - change the style he needs a wind
91:55 - condition it needs a way to start over
91:57 - it could use like some settings of like
92:00 - I want to add you know I wanted to have
92:02 - 20 bees I want the column number certain
92:04 - number of columns and rows so you could
92:06 - build a whole interface for it there is
92:08 - so many things you could do in the chat
92:12 - someone is suggesting to do this with
92:14 - all dom elements so don't use canvas at
92:16 - all but maybe these are all divs that
92:18 - would be an exciting thing to try to you
92:19 - get a little CSS animations as you click
92:21 - on things so many possible things you
92:23 - could try to do but there it is
92:26 - minesweeper in under an hour multiplayer
92:29 - with the server is something you could
92:31 - do I hope you make some variations I
92:32 - hope you share
92:33 - with me and next week on my live stream
92:36 - I will share hopefully a whole bunch of
92:39 - variations and things that people make
92:40 - with this game be sweeper thanks and see
92:44 - you in a future coding challenge all
92:50 - right hey what time is it it is 12:07 so
92:56 - I do have to get going but and I did
93:00 - make my own so they're just gonna be one
93:01 - new video from this week which is this
93:04 - video how is that was that good useful
93:10 - can you play it playing with an AI
93:13 - hexagonal grid okay so what if what else
93:15 - what else can I do today maybe answer a
93:16 - few questions can I look on Twitter I'm
93:24 - looking at the chat now boy that was
93:30 - actually quite fun to make I want to get
93:34 - rid of the console logging where did I
93:39 - have that so the question is should I
93:45 - start should I make a quick intro to
93:53 - this coding challenge yeah how do how do
93:59 - I imagine playing minesweeper with an AI
94:02 - it's a great question well I imagine
94:04 - that this is a pretty solved game in
94:07 - other words we don't need some kind of
94:08 - you know complex neural network based
94:11 - machine learning learning system
94:13 - although they'll be interesting to try
94:14 - you know reading the pixels and what's
94:15 - going on and knowing where to click next
94:17 - i mean if you look at this I think it's
94:19 - just a matter of you know doing what I
94:25 - would do in my head which is riddle
94:27 - let's let's put this back to a
94:28 - reasonable number let's put this to
94:33 - total B's 10 so looking at this there
94:41 - would be a way to check every spot and
94:44 - know if there has
94:46 - b.o.b there after you've clicked and
94:49 - then if you know that then you know you
94:54 - could really check every spot and
94:55 - actually what you would do the opposite
94:57 - I would check every spot and for example
94:59 - this spot if there were a B here then
95:05 - this spot this this would have to be a
95:09 - two so I guess I could determine where I
95:12 - know there so I know there has to be a B
95:14 - here because this has a 1 okay but
95:16 - there's only one spot available so I
95:19 - would mark in my sort of brain that I
95:21 - know there's a B there then I would ask
95:24 - the question would there be a B here no
95:26 - there can't be because then this would
95:27 - be a 2 so then I would click here next
95:30 - and then I suppose if there's no known
95:33 - place to click I could just use a
95:36 - probability and say so like let me start
95:38 - over okay okay well where is there the
95:41 - least likelihood of there being another
95:44 - B well I know that there's only each one
95:48 - of these spots just has a 1 out of 8
95:50 - chance so that's a good place to try I
95:54 - could try there okay now what's the
95:58 - probability I could just do it I could
95:59 - do sort of like a probability analysis
96:01 - for every single spot and then pick from
96:03 - the lowest probability okay so that
96:06 - would be a great exercise for somebody
96:07 - to try to build an AI can you release
96:10 - sometimes an overview which country is
96:12 - your live stream are watching would be
96:14 - interesting yeah ask me that on Twitter
96:17 - because it takes about 24 hours but I'll
96:19 - get from today from today's live stream
96:21 - I'll get a report of through the YouTube
96:24 - analytics of like all the different
96:25 - countries that are watching and I'm
96:27 - happy to like tweet a screenshot of that
96:28 - or something but I won't be able to do
96:29 - that till tomorrow and I won't remember
96:31 - her so but if you tweet me everyone tell
96:34 - put it on github should I put it on
96:35 - github right now let's do that why not
96:39 - do that during the actual live stream
96:46 - and I'm just gonna do it because I can
96:49 - log in now I don't remember my password
96:56 - is the problem
96:58 - that's the property this is a thing I
97:00 - have this like sophisticated I can I can
97:02 - get it on my phone okay if you guys
97:13 - don't mind bearing with me I use one
97:15 - password buzz marketing one password by
97:18 - accident dude maybe maybe potential
97:22 - sponsor Soho now so I have to look up
97:27 - and this normally I would have a Chrome
97:29 - extension that would just enter it but
97:31 - I'm logged in on this computer not the
97:33 - way I normally login and I have like
97:37 - 2-step verification I got all the
97:39 - privacy stuff so I'm looking for my
97:41 - github password and so let's look at the
97:51 - password now I need to now I need to
97:58 - open 2-step verification 2-step
98:03 - verification I feel like this I wanted I
98:08 - was hoping to minesweeper video would
98:09 - somehow be more entertaining in a
98:11 - delightfully ridiculous way but I feel
98:14 - like I was much too serious about
98:15 - programming it where is my Authenticator
98:20 - here it is two five nine nine four nine
98:27 - [Music]
98:28 - okay
98:29 - so now I should be able to upload files
98:36 - so what coding challenge number is this
98:38 - 71 can anybody tell me when where is it
98:49 - mine sweeper minesweeper so I think it's
98:55 - 71 coding challenge 71 minesweeper it
99:01 - was fun and useful good thanks I'm
99:04 - always doubting myself here
99:06 - I think uploading
99:11 - odhh why not what's the worst thing that
99:15 - can happen
99:27 - if you put Alcazar pasady 3x3 box around
99:40 - a spot with a neighboring B where n is
99:41 - the amount of neighbors you could see
99:43 - hotspots of bees that's a great idea
99:48 - okay did that come into that work there
99:53 - it is
99:54 - Cody challenge 71 minesweeper is now B
99:58 - sweeper oh it should be called B sweeper
100:00 - somebody want to pull Rick
100:02 - somebody can pull request that change
100:04 - this to be sweeper I guess I do want to
100:06 - use even though I'm calling it B sweeper
100:08 - you know my for selfish reasons I think
100:12 - I want the coding challenge on YouTube
100:14 - to be called minesweeper the title the
100:17 - tags because because that's what people
100:24 - will be searching for I know I doubt
100:26 - people gonna be searching on YouTube B
100:28 - sweeper code B sweeper is there actually
100:34 - a game called B sweeper huh cool okay so
100:40 - I think I'm finished for today I have
100:42 - got it's 12:15 i I know this is just one
100:47 - coding challenge for today I would love
100:49 - to do more I will I'm gonna be doing
100:51 - some live streaming from the ITP show um
100:54 - let's see
100:55 - Schiffman ITP winter show 2016 so I made
101:01 - this video which you can't really hear
101:06 - because I but this was a video I made
101:08 - that that showed a bunch of projects
101:11 - from the winter show which was in
101:13 - December this is happening this week
101:15 - here at ITP you can come to it if you're
101:20 - in New York Tuesday and Wednesday I hope
101:23 - to livestream from my phone and I got
101:25 - this like a gimbal thing gimbal
101:27 - stabilizer so I'm gonna walk around the
101:28 - show with my phone looking at projects
101:31 - and interviewing people
101:32 - so that'll come maybe I'll even do that
101:34 - during some of the setups
101:35 - people even do a test about this
101:37 - afternoon so you can stay tuned for
101:38 - those and hopefully I'll be back the
101:40 - semester is over now there's a couple
101:43 - weeks there's two weeks in July that I'm
101:45 - out of town in two weeks in August that
101:47 - I'm out of town but otherwise this
101:48 - summer I might move in June to do twice
101:51 - a week live streams I might do some more
101:53 - I gotta get through all that machine
101:54 - learning content and do some more coding
101:55 - challenges so okay so let's see what
102:03 - else can I say today so let me is it
102:15 - playing that music and I can't hear it
102:16 - yeah oh so I will mention if you would
102:24 - if you like what you see and you want to
102:26 - join a slack patron group you can go to
102:34 - patreon.com/crashcourse v.com
102:40 - if you want to get one of these
102:42 - hopefully coding trade goodies they are
102:45 - available along with some t-shirts and
102:47 - different things um what else do I want
102:49 - to plug here I plugged I to be show uh
102:53 - processing foundation
102:55 - I would rather you support the
102:59 - processing foundation than me if you can
103:00 - only support one but you if you if you
103:03 - use processing our p5 yes and processing
103:05 - related tools consider becoming a member
103:08 - and let me look at the chat again oh
103:13 - yeah I'm gonna revamp the patreon
103:16 - rewards and try to change them around so
103:21 - I'm gonna be doing that in the next week
103:23 - and meatball mix it with a t-shirt or
103:24 - reward and that
103:26 - okay could you do a coding challenge
103:29 - visualizing sorting methods I would love
103:31 - that if you're not familiar by the way
103:33 - with Michael both stalks who's the
103:36 - creator of D threes visualizing
103:39 - algorithms this is a wonderful
103:43 - walkthrough and page about visualizing
103:45 - different algorithms and I think there's
103:47 - some sorting algorithms on this page
103:49 - right here I would love to do a coding
103:52 - challenge that does something like this
103:53 - that would be really fun and great and
103:55 - nothing I make will look nearly as nice
103:56 - or beautiful as what Michael Bostock is
103:59 - made okay looking at the chat here alka
104:08 - that is a great and let me see if I can
104:10 - recreate this alka posted a really great
104:13 - suggestion so let me see here is that
104:19 - still there yes or is it just caching it
104:21 - it's still there the code still there so
104:25 - what do what what do I do when I click
104:27 - on it let's see what was the suggestion
104:34 - app acity box were a neighboring B okay
104:38 - so wait wait so if I in ravit in in the
104:43 - show function if if it's revealed I'm
104:48 - gonna say alpha equals 10 times this dot
104:57 - neighbor account no stroke I'm going to
105:02 - draw a rectangle fill 0 comma a if it's
105:08 - revealed let's try this that didn't seem
105:12 - to work is this happening oh you know I
105:14 - wonder if something has gone wrong
105:16 - because I renamed the file
105:24 - oh no what did I know yeah cuz there's a
105:32 - whoops so hold on sorry in the I rename
105:40 - the file so I'm actually not looking at
105:43 - the right thing right now and try this
105:48 - little variation let's get rid of this
105:53 - and this is what I want to be editing in
105:56 - Adam in cell under show let's put this
106:03 - back in here and let's go here and see
106:07 - this doesn't exist anymore run the
106:14 - server whoa I might hold on I can't tell
106:22 - if I if it's there because I like my
106:24 - yeah there's like this whoa what's going
106:27 - on what did I do
106:28 - Oh because I'm not just doing it only if
106:30 - it's revealed what did I miss hold on we
106:39 - look at the chat needs to be masked to
106:42 - only call cover areas oops the camera
106:47 - went off
106:55 - oh you know what the range is
107:00 - hold on let me do let me do this map
107:06 - this neighbor count between 0 & 8 -
107:12 - between an alpha of 0 and 255 right and
107:17 - let's let's put this for everything
107:20 - right now whether it's revealed or not
107:22 - yeah so this is like a little map of
107:26 - like where the hot spots are yeah that's
107:31 - kind of cool so it's like a little bit
107:33 - of a clue here that we can see obviously
107:35 - if I click here and what I could do is
107:38 - also you know I could use like red or
107:45 - something just to sort of see that yeah
107:49 - that's kind of that's interesting and
107:51 - now now what I'm curious to do also is
107:57 - make the it bigger and make the size
108:02 - smaller and add like 50 bees woo and add
108:10 - like you know hundred bees and you can
108:14 - see here yeah so that's kind of
108:16 - interesting to see this is very much
108:18 - like reminiscent of like a cellular
108:19 - automata system so some interesting
108:21 - thing oh but the text placement is all
108:23 - wrong now
108:24 - so that's your great one thing that
108:25 - needs to be fixed is the text placement
108:27 - should really be controlled so that I
108:29 - would accept by the way as a pull
108:31 - request so one people sometimes I get
108:33 - well when should I make a pull request
108:34 - and when should I actually link to link
108:39 - to something that I have made and so
108:45 - pull requests to change the actual
108:48 - example code that's in the browser
108:49 - that's in the repository should really
108:52 - only be for like significant bug fixes
108:55 - or like minor adjustments that are gonna
108:57 - make it easier for someone who's making
108:59 - their own creative interpretation to
109:00 - work with so if you're making your own
109:02 - creative interpretation visualizing it
109:04 - differently changing adding
109:05 - interactivity changing the dose or
109:07 - narrative of
109:08 - game then that's your but but if you
109:10 - want to add something that just fixes
109:11 - the way the text is placed based on like
109:14 - the size of it that could be useful as a
109:16 - pull request okay
109:18 - my sound board died oh text-align you
109:22 - can have Center Center
109:23 - oh I didn't know that yeah okay so I'm
109:27 - uh now it's 1223 this dream has been for
109:31 - almost two hours I will take a couple
109:36 - more questions I want to plug in my
109:43 - let's charge up this this is so
109:46 - unnecessary what I'm doing but I'm gonna
109:48 - do it anyway cuz I'm about to say good I
109:50 - can't say goodbye it's so hard to say
109:55 - good that's not a song let's see if it
110:02 - comes alive up okay
110:03 - so any last questions I agree blew it
110:07 - should be determined by the box size in
110:09 - which turn should be determined by the
110:10 - window size yes
110:13 - this laptop has a hole in it yeah it's
110:16 - the green in the old coding rainbow
110:18 - sticker what kind of music do I like
110:23 - it's a good question I'm I'm a musical
110:26 - theater fan I love the musical theater I
110:28 - love the Broadway
110:29 - give me some show tunes that I'm happy
110:32 - classical music I like dance music I
110:35 - like I like all music could I do a
110:39 - neural network video in p5 sometime that
110:41 - is coming up and actually there's a big
110:43 - bug maybe I'll fix this bug right now in
110:47 - the next five minutes cuz it's been on
110:48 - my to-do list all week shift man okay so
111:00 - let's go to my actually I'm not gonna
111:02 - let's see here I have a simple little
111:06 - library for a neural network in p5 okay
111:11 - my soundboard has come back not now
111:17 - where is it
111:26 - okay there is a bug in this particular
111:32 - example which is what was it called
111:41 - neural network p5 so I'm gonna do this
111:47 - as a coding challenge for sure at some
111:49 - point and this is just like not at all
111:52 - working and I think the reason why is I
111:55 - made the library I'm gonna get to all
111:57 - this in a future video I made the
112:00 - library require a an activation function
112:08 - so if I go into here we look at this
112:12 - code to see when I create new neural
112:18 - network you know what I'm gonna do bug
112:22 - this on my own time later this afternoon
112:27 - oh yeah
112:29 - t-rex game that would be a great coding
112:31 - challenge Sudoku generator or solver I
112:34 - would love to do that as well I got to
112:35 - fix this example but I will get to I'm
112:37 - gonna build a neural network example in
112:39 - p5 or processing soon enough that's
112:41 - coming everybody wants the deep learning
112:46 - you know all this deep learning stuff
112:51 - maybe you should go outside and garden
112:54 - that's be my suggestion but I will I'm
112:58 - gonna do some I'm gonna do some videos
113:00 - I'm going to look at Karis and some
113:02 - Python and that sort of thing a genetic
113:04 - algorithm to solve minesweeper I think
113:06 - that's probably overkill it's
113:07 - unnecessary because it's sort of a
113:08 - solved you know mathematically you could
113:11 - just be solved but it's certainly a
113:12 - possible possibility okay so what else
113:16 - do I got I'm gonna see you guys
113:17 - hopefully in some bonus live streams
113:20 - about with interviewing students about
113:22 - their projects and things here at ITP
113:25 - and I
113:29 - and then I'll be back hopefully next
113:31 - Friday probably again in the afternoon I
113:34 - know for shorts there's a lot of
113:36 - graduation activities that I'll have to
113:38 - be at so next week is gonna be a little
113:39 - tricky but hopefully I'll find a time to
113:41 - do a live stream but then the summer
113:43 - will arrive and I will have all the time
113:45 - in the world to internet hug all of you
113:49 - with strange code examples and I have a
113:51 - new year's resolution from a long time
113:54 - ago which is that I want to hope they
113:56 - have a lot of guest tutorials in June so
113:58 - I need to have something I've got to
114:00 - work on add to my to-do list to make
114:02 - happen okay thanks everybody and I will
114:05 - see you in a future okay shouldn't look
114:10 - at ridiculous news notifications on my
114:13 - phone that's why I put my phone over
114:14 - there okay good bye everybody
114:16 - see you in the feud see you in the
114:18 - future I got to find the right good
114:20 - thing to move here to hit stop
114:21 - good bye happy train riding Kodi train
114:25 - choo choo all aboard
114:27 - thank you oh I was gonna read from this
114:30 - book but I'll do that next time okay
114:39 - hold on I'm back I forgot do I need to
114:42 - make a little intro to that coding
114:43 - challenge so let me see about this
114:51 - coming back okay I forgot those let me
114:56 - go let me go back here too let me let me
114:59 - put this back to what it was at one time
115:05 - [Music]
115:09 - and let me go to here and take off this
115:15 - I I forgot that maybe what I need to do
115:21 - but I should do is record a little like
115:23 - intro to the coding challenge I often do
115:25 - that so let me do that can move this
115:34 - over and do this okay so I'm gonna do
115:40 - that so this is a weird thing I hope
115:43 - like that not like take that like a
115:45 - thousands of people suddenly just join
115:46 - cuz this is gonna last for about five
115:47 - minutes I probably didn't even need to
115:49 - do this live streaming but I can't do
115:51 - anything unless I'm live on the internet
115:52 - apparently so
115:55 - so I wish I could automate it oh boy oh
115:59 - so many things I messed up oh right hold
116:04 - on hold on let me get the code back hold
116:13 - on hold on
116:17 - total B's 20 and where's the text got to
116:24 - change the text size
116:31 - let's try to make it just whatever the W
116:33 - is whoops oh my really text size
116:51 - oh that is working well let's just leave
116:56 - it what it was sorry I know what it was
116:59 - this was 20 this was 20 there we go
117:07 - okay sorry everybody this is actually a
117:13 - live video but it's very gonna it's
117:16 - gonna be over soon
117:17 - because I'm just doing a quick
117:18 - introduction I like the idea that maybe
117:22 - the coding train logo might actually
117:24 - appear more in this it's over there okay
117:27 - oh this turned off again okay hold on
117:38 - okay ah oh no go back okay maybe this
117:48 - might be pointless but I'm gonna try it
117:49 - anyway hello hello welcome to another
117:59 - coding challenge in this coding
118:00 - challenge I'm gonna make minesweeper I
118:02 - actually already did the coding
118:03 - challenge I'm recording a quick intro so
118:05 - you can see what's gonna happen it's
118:06 - about it's a long one so about somewhere
118:08 - between 45 minutes in an hour I will
118:10 - point out this would be less time to
118:12 - make minesweeper that it took me to make
118:13 - pong which goes to show you how my brain
118:15 - doesn't really work in normal ways the
118:18 - pong should really be simpler everything
118:19 - but anyway this is minesweeper it's
118:21 - actually be sweeper but because these
118:25 - are bees and not mines but it doesn't
118:26 - really matter the point of this game is
118:28 - that you click and when you click you're
118:30 - trying to avoid getting stung by a bee
118:32 - and so here this cell has three bees
118:36 - next to it so i'm gonna click somewhere
118:37 - else this one is - home - click
118:39 - somewhere else 3 click click oh and I
118:43 - hit a bee
118:43 - so let me try again oh I hit a bee oh I
118:47 - hate to be he ah there we go when I
118:49 - click somewhere that has no neighbors it
118:53 - it it reveals all the other spots around
118:57 - it that also have no neighbors and the
118:58 - numbers so ok so that's that's be
119:01 - sweeper I can see I can see for sure
119:02 - that there's will be here if I were to
119:03 - click there
119:04 - so this is the game I'm gonna program it
119:06 - from scratch in JavaScript all the way
119:09 - through I'm gonna make a whole bunch of
119:10 - mistakes and get lost and at the end of
119:12 - this I will give you a lot of
119:14 - suggestions and things that you could
119:15 - add or try to make your own creative
119:16 - version of it and I hope you will share
119:18 - those with me code in the description on
119:21 - github okay thanks enjoy this coding
119:23 - challenge all aboard
119:26 - okay alright that's it Audio not synced
119:36 - so people are saying the audio in the
119:37 - video are out of sync this is something
119:40 - I do not have control over it's
119:43 - sometimes this seems to happen if you
119:45 - refresh the page it usually fixes it and
119:48 - also when I do the edited version of
