00:00 - [TRAIN WHISTLE]
00:00 - OK, that was the
sound effect this time
00:02 - for my substitute train whistle.
00:04 - Welcome back.
00:04 - You came back.
00:05 - That's so nice of you.
00:06 - I'm here in the
second video in my
00:08 - How to Make a
Discord Bot series.
00:10 - I actually was just
recording this,
00:12 - but I had a technical problem,
so I'm doing this again.
00:14 - But that means I'm
going to be perfect.
00:16 - I'm not going to
make any mistakes.
00:17 - Very rarely happens, I mean
I will make lots of mistakes.
00:20 - So where do you need
to be doing now?
00:21 - The first thing where I want
to get started in this video
00:23 - is I want to make the
Discord bot itself.
00:27 - I'm going to need to do that
through the Discord website.
00:29 - So go to Discord.com.
00:31 - Make sure you're signed
up with an account
00:33 - and you're logged in.
00:34 - You can scroll all the
way down to the bottom
00:36 - and look for where
it says Developers.
00:39 - So if I click here, I am now in
the Discord Developer portal.
00:43 - So there's lots of
information here.
00:45 - I encourage you to read
it through, take a look
00:46 - at this stuff, read about
all the possibilities
00:48 - and the polices.
00:49 - But what I want to do here
is go under Applications.
00:53 - You can see here I've made
several applications already.
00:55 - I've been making Discord
bots for a little while now.
00:57 - I have a bot that I made
for the ITPIMA program.
01:00 - That's the department
that I teach
01:01 - at at NYU School of the Arts.
01:03 - I have a dad bot which
will tell you dad jokes.
01:06 - It's dormant right now.
01:07 - I've got to revive that one.
01:08 - And then two other example
bots for different courses
01:10 - that I've been
teaching here at NYU.
01:12 - So it's time now for us to
make our coding train bot.
01:15 - So I'm going to click
New Application.
01:19 - Are you a game dev?
01:21 - Oh, my goodness, this is such
a deep philosophical question.
01:24 - I'm not a game dev.
01:25 - I am going to name my
application Coding Train Bot,
01:29 - and I'm going to call
it Application here.
01:31 - This is a little
bit silly, but this
01:32 - is-- there's a difference
between the application
01:35 - and the bot itself,
which I will get to.
01:37 - That will become evident as I
go a little further through this
01:39 - here.
01:40 - So I'm going to hit Create.
01:41 - I want to have a neat icon.
01:43 - I actually spent
like a half an hour
01:46 - earlier trying to
pick which icon.
01:48 - And I'm just going to
go straight to it now--
01:50 - rainbow hearts.
01:53 - Can't go wrong with
rainbow hearts.
01:55 - And then look, I've got some
important information here.
01:59 - I've got a client ID.
02:01 - This number is really important.
02:03 - I'm going to make use of that
in just a moment in order
02:05 - to add the bot to a
particular Discord server.
02:09 - I also have the client secret.
02:11 - This is a secret key that
you absolutely should not
02:14 - show to anybody else.
02:16 - For example, I really, really
definitely should not right now
02:19 - hit Click to reveal.
02:20 - Ahhh!
02:22 - All of you will not be
able to hack my account,
02:25 - because if you do
this by accident,
02:26 - it's not the end of the world.
02:28 - I can very quickly
just hit Regenerate
02:30 - and I've got a new
one that you also see.
02:32 - Don't worry.
02:33 - Later, before you watch this,
I'll have regenerated it.
02:36 - The client secret
actually isn't something
02:38 - that I'm going to use at
all in this video series.
02:41 - The client secret
is a code that you
02:42 - need if you were making a
Discord integration from a game
02:45 - or some other broader context.
02:47 - And all I'm doing
is making a bot.
02:49 - And I want to talk to the
Discord API from my bot.
02:52 - For that, I need something
else called a bot token.
02:55 - So let's move on
to that next stage,
02:57 - and I'm going to go down here.
02:59 - So even though I've
made the application,
03:01 - I have not made the bot itself.
03:04 - So I want to look over
here and find Bot.
03:06 - Click there.
03:07 - I don't have a bot
yet, but I can get one.
03:10 - Let's add a bot.
03:12 - Yes, do it.
03:15 - The username will just be--
let's call it Choo Choo Bot.
03:19 - This here, this token that
I'm about to reveal to you,
03:22 - this is something that I
will need for the code.
03:24 - And also, this is
something I'm really
03:26 - going to have to think about.
03:27 - If I'm putting this
token in the code,
03:29 - and then I open source
my project so you
03:31 - can use this as
an example, I want
03:33 - to make sure that I don't
include the token in that.
03:35 - So I will address that later
on as I get to future videos,
03:38 - but for right now, I just
want to make note of that.
03:40 - And I'll be coming back
to that in the next video.
03:43 - We're almost there.
03:44 - I've got my Discord account.
03:46 - I've made my client application.
03:48 - And now I attached a bot to
that particular application.
03:53 - The next thing I
want to do is make
03:55 - this bot a member of the Coding
Train Discord server itself.
03:59 - To do that, I need to go
back to General Information,
04:02 - and I need to grab
this client ID.
04:06 - Once I have the client ID
copied into my clipboard,
04:09 - I can paste it into
this URL path--
04:12 - discord.com/oaut
h2/authorize?cli
04:15 - ent_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID--
04:18 - I'm going to paste
it right in here.
04:20 - And this now is a
particular URL that you
04:23 - could embed into a
website or send to anybody
04:25 - if you wanted them to add your
bot to a particular server.
04:29 - And this brings up an important
question about trust, right?
04:34 - In this case, right now,
I am the maker of the bot
04:38 - and I am the owner
of the Discord server
04:40 - to which I'm going
to add that bot.
04:42 - So I am just trusting myself.
04:44 - And I think it's going to be OK.
04:46 - But if somebody were to
send you a link to their bot
04:49 - and say, please add
this to your server,
04:51 - or if you're just asking people
willy nilly, please add my bot,
04:54 - please add my bot, there's
trust that has to happen there.
04:57 - Bots have a lot of
permissions and things
04:58 - they could do in a server,
and could really wreak havoc.
05:01 - So this is something I'm
going to have to think about.
05:03 - How do I vet people's
creative bots
05:04 - that they make to
include into the server?
05:06 - Maybe I'll come up with a
process for that someday.
05:08 - But most likely, if you're
going to take this next step,
05:11 - you might not have
permissions right now
05:13 - to add a bot to any
server you're a member of.
05:15 - So you might need to create
your own Discord server first.
05:18 - When you're logged into Discord,
you'll see a plus button,
05:21 - Add a Server.
05:22 - That's the place you could
start to create your own server
05:25 - for testing your bot.
05:26 - But for me, I'm just going
to take this particular URL,
05:31 - open up a new tab and
paste it in, and hit Enter.
05:34 - And now, here we are.
05:35 - Coding Train Bot Application,
Connect to Discord.
05:38 - It's going to give me a
list of servers where I have
05:41 - the manage server permission.
05:45 - So I have the manage server
permission for these servers.
05:48 - I want to add it to
Coding Train Choo Choo.
05:50 - I'm going to click Authorize.
05:52 - It's very exciting.
05:54 - All right, and then
I'm going to click--
05:56 - but, but I am a robot!
05:58 - I'm a bot!
05:59 - I'm a robot!
06:01 - What do I do?
06:03 - As a human being, I am
the maker of the bot,
06:05 - so I guess I can click
this, I'm not a robot.
06:08 - And it's authorized.
06:09 - Let's head over to the
Coding Train Discord server.
06:11 - I can actually quickly
check the passenger log.
06:14 - That's a channel that
whenever a new user joins,
06:18 - a message is posted there.
06:19 - And look what we've
got at the bottom here,
06:22 - welcome aboard Choo Choo Bot.
06:24 - Choo Choo bot better read
that code of conduct.
06:27 - And Choo Choo bot has
hopped into the server.
06:29 - So I know that the
bot is there and I
06:31 - am ready for the next step.
06:33 - I'm going to head over to a
channel called Bot Testing.
06:36 - This is the channel
that I'm going to use
06:38 - for working with the bot.
06:39 - Eventually, I might let the bot
run rampant all over the server
06:43 - itself and all the
other channels.
06:45 - But as I'm figuring out and
getting the basics working,
06:47 - I want to stay in this channel.
06:48 - Let's just mention it to
make sure it's really there.
06:51 - There it is.
06:52 - Hi.
06:53 - So at some point, I could
certainly, from the code, see,
06:57 - did somebody mention
the bot, did mention me?
06:59 - And then reply appropriately.
07:01 - So that's what I'll
be getting into next.
07:02 - We were there.
07:04 - We've now made-- have
a Discord account,
07:07 - made a Discord
application, added a bot
07:10 - to that application, and
then authorized that bot
07:13 - on a particular Discord server.
07:14 - If we've done all of that, we
are ready for the next step,
07:18 - actually writing some code
to connect to the Discord
07:21 - API itself, and have that bot
communicate and participate
07:24 - in the Discord community.
07:26 - And that'll be fun.
07:27 - I can't wait.
07:27 - I'm going to go do that now.
07:29 - And I'll see you
there if you want.
07:30 - That's what I said last
time in the last video.
07:32 - Where's the whistle?
