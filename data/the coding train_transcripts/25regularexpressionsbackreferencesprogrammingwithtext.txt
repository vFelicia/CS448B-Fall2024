00:00 - okay here's another regular expressions
00:03 - video and in this video I'm going to
00:04 - show you how to use a back reference in
00:06 - a regular expression so this is going to
00:08 - make use of capturing groups which I
00:09 - covered in the previous video but what I
00:11 - didn't do in the previous video is I
00:13 - only showed you how to use a capturing
00:15 - group in a fine and replace operation
00:16 - where the syntax is dollar side one for
00:21 - referring to group number one but what
00:23 - if I want to refer to group number one
00:24 - in the regular expression itself in this
00:28 - case I use backslash one so a classic
00:32 - scenario for this which is taken from
00:35 - Jeffrey Friedel's mastering regular
00:37 - expressions book which I highly
00:38 - recommend is searching for double words
00:41 - what I mean by that is o is is appears
00:44 - twice in a row double double appears
00:45 - twice in a row not not appear story
00:47 - surround why why what if I want to
00:49 - search anytime two words appear in a row
00:51 - so let's figure out how I would do this
00:53 - so first I can look for just any
00:57 - sequence of you know at one or more word
01:00 - characters in a row and you can see I've
01:01 - matched all of the words now I could
01:04 - capture that alright I could say one or
01:07 - more word characters in a row followed
01:10 - by what some sort of white space right
01:15 - backslash s I don't know if you can see
01:17 - this I'm gonna zoom in here to try to
01:19 - help you see it better
01:20 - backslash s followed by what backslash
01:26 - one look at this I'm saying match any
01:31 - number of word characters in a row
01:33 - followed by and capture it as Group one
01:36 - followed by space and hey the thing that
01:39 - you captured is Group one not any word
01:41 - character in a row the specific actual
01:43 - sequence of word characters you match
01:47 - that again so look at this it doesn't
01:50 - get you two words in a row right you're
01:53 - no I'm not matching some text or
01:56 - somewhere or am typing I'm only matching
01:58 - when the the exact same word is followed
02:00 - by the exact same word rainbow rainbow
02:02 - unicorn Yuriko not not double double now
02:04 - there is some weird stuff going on here
02:06 - for example look here it matched is is
02:11 - this is and it matched s some with s and
02:15 - s so one thing I need to do here is have
02:18 - word boundaries as part of this as well
02:21 - so for example if I say okay well
02:23 - there's got to be a word boundary here
02:25 - and then there's also got to be a word
02:28 - boundary here then now I'm only getting
02:32 - is is text X double double not not
02:34 - rainbow rainbow unicorn unicorn
02:36 - now notice again this is how regular
02:38 - expressions work it matched III but
02:40 - didn't match this I I and again there's
02:43 - some ways around that which you know
02:45 - I'll leave that for another time
02:46 - but you can see this is a very powerful
02:48 - thing that you can do that you can
02:50 - actually refer to something that was
02:51 - matched in a regular expression by using
02:54 - backslash 1 and this sort of double
02:56 - words exercise a double words example I
02:58 - think is a good one to look at
03:01 - okay thanks hey this was a short one I
03:04 - have a camera went off forever
03:05 - typing okay so thanks for watching this
03:08 - one and after this video you have now
03:11 - reached the point I think let me say a
03:13 - couple things there's more to regular
03:16 - expressions than when I've covered in
03:17 - this sort of introduction I think for
03:19 - videos so far I've kind of going through
03:21 - position meta characters single
03:22 - character quantifiers character classes
03:24 - call alternation capturing groups back
03:25 - references cetera there's bored there's
03:27 - something called look ahead and look
03:28 - behind there's probably more meta
03:29 - characters that I miss there's a lot of
03:31 - nuance it's different in different
03:32 - programming languages I can't get to
03:34 - everything here I'm sure I've missed
03:35 - stuff I'll come back maybe do more but I
03:37 - want to move now to actually looking at
03:39 - how you execute regular expressions in
03:41 - the JavaScript programming language
03:43 - itself with the functions test search
03:45 - match exact split replace and then do
03:47 - some a coding challenge around rebbe
03:49 - expression so in the next videos you'll
03:50 - start to see regular expressions in
03:52 - JavaScript itself
