00:00 - (whistle blowing)
00:01 - - Hello.
00:02 - It's been another year.
00:02 - It's close to the end of 2018.
00:04 - Earlier this week was the
ITP/IMA end of semester show.
00:08 - ITP and IMA are a
graduate and undergraduate
00:11 - program here at Tisch School of the Arts
00:12 - New York University.
00:13 - So many students made so many
00:15 - amazing and wonderful projects.
00:16 - There's a long, 2 1/2
hour livestream of me
00:18 - wandering around the entire
thing, that you can watch.
00:21 - But what you're about to
see is a highlight reel
00:23 - of a bunch of those projects.
00:26 - Special thank you to Jenny Lim
00:27 - for holding the camera
during this long, livestream.
00:31 - And also to Matthhieu
Blanchette for always doing
00:33 - such a wonderful job editing
stuff on the coding train.
00:36 - Happy Holidays.
00:37 - Happy New Year.
00:38 - See ya in 2019.
00:39 - (bossa nova music)
00:51 - - My name is Tushar.
00:51 - I'm from India and this
is a voice synthesizer
00:55 - which makes music from your voice.
00:57 - And it's not a normal synth
that you can play music on.
01:00 - You sort of collaborate with the synth.
01:01 - And you say okay, make me some music using
01:04 - these three or four
notes and then the synth
01:07 - gives you what it feel like today.
01:09 - So, I record my voice.
01:11 - (Tushar humming)
01:14 - And then.
01:17 - (synthesizer music)
01:40 - So, there's an element
of my voice in there.
01:43 - There's also a synth.
01:44 - It's called the Vo-5ynth,
voice and synth set together.
01:47 - And, of course, the drums is drums,
01:50 - that's not from my voice.
01:51 - (synthesizer music)
01:55 - - I'm Ashley Lewis.
01:57 - I made Lost and Found Bots.
02:00 - They're these little robots that feel lost
02:02 - without one another.
02:04 - And when you connect their
hands, they feel found.
02:06 - So, these are them.
02:07 - So, you can see they're
little faces say lost.
02:10 - And then when you connect their hands.
02:13 - You have to bring them really
close like they're hugging.
02:17 - And then they'll feel found.
02:20 - But it's a prototype for a bigger project.
02:22 - I want a little robot society
- Uh huh.
02:24 - - Where there are like,
10, and you can connect
02:27 - their hands in duos or trios to find out
02:29 - what their rules of their society are.
02:32 - And how they operate socially.
02:35 - - My name is Stefan.
02:36 - My partner is Julia Rich.
02:38 - Unfortunately, they are not here right now
02:40 - but I can do my best to explain on my own.
02:43 - It's an interactive alien garden.
02:46 - So, the idea is that it's sort of a
02:49 - discovery experience.
02:51 - So, users will come and touch things.
02:53 - It's very tactile.
02:54 - And just discover different interactions.
03:01 - - I'm Jenny.
03:02 - I'm from Taiwan.
03:03 - And my background's UX designer.
03:06 - - I'm Morgan, I'm from Reno, Nevada.
03:08 - And my background's
electrical engineering.
03:10 - And this is called Reverie Field.
03:12 - It's kind of a self reflection experience
03:14 - where the user's prompted
to think about a memory
03:16 - and the emotions associated
with that memory.
03:18 - And then through, they use the hand panel.
03:22 - Kind of transcend those
emotions and the memory
03:23 - into lights and manipulate
the lights accordingly.
03:27 - - [Woman] You are now entering
a safe and calming space.
03:32 - Think of a memory that has
been on your mind lately.
03:36 - Please, take a moment to focus on it.
03:40 - (piano music)
03:48 - - My name is Guillermo
Montecinos and this project
03:51 - is a collaboration with Sofia Suazo.
03:53 - We built an AR and AI theremin
03:59 - that you can play but it is not here
04:01 - and you can't see it
and you can't touch it.
04:04 - But you can also play it.
04:05 - (theremin music)
04:05 - So, this is, like, a two person.
04:10 - It's kind of interactive
because the person there
04:13 - is playing it and listen to
the theremin and the other one
04:15 - can see the theremin and
listen to the playing.
04:19 - - My name is Jaekook.
04:20 - And this is project called Focus Helper.
04:23 - This is based on the
idea that how to reduce
04:26 - misunderstanding in conversation.
04:28 - So, I want to make people
really private space.
04:31 - So, just focus on their opponents.
04:33 - So, on this side of this product
04:36 - it has a magnifying glass and mics.
04:39 - And if you're close to
your person it focus
04:41 - on their face and then
it magnify their faces.
04:44 - And you can hear more clearly the voice
04:47 - of the partner or opponent.
04:52 - (bossa nova music)
05:12 - - Hello, I'm Eva.
05:13 - I'm a first year at ITP.
05:16 - I created a project about dyslexia.
05:18 - So, I wanted to create
a project that would
05:22 - bring up the frustrations
that dyslexics face
05:24 - while learning a language.
05:25 - So, I created an alphabet
and are having people read
05:29 - and write in this language that I made.
05:31 - Over the headphones it'll say the letter
05:34 - that you're scanning
and so, you can kind of
05:36 - decode the language.
05:37 - And then when you're ready you
can scan in the write section
05:40 - and you can write any word that you want.
05:43 - - My name is Marcella.
05:44 - I'm from Brazil.
05:47 - My project is called IMERSA.
05:49 - It's a sculpture that builds itself when
05:52 - you're there with it for it to happen.
05:55 - Basically, I was thinking
about my relationship
05:59 - with, like, coming here and
everything that happened.
06:02 - Having to connect with a lot of people
06:04 - and especially after what's
happening in my country.
06:08 - How hard it was for me to try
to talk to people about it.
06:12 - And try to create some
empathy or something.
06:16 - So, yeah, that's basically it.
06:17 - - Hi, I'm Jasper from China.
06:20 - Our project is called Pinning Puppets.
06:23 - We are trying to show the relationship
06:24 - between people and smartphones.
06:27 - I'll put our phone here.
06:29 - They will all be attracted
by our smartphone.
06:32 - And they keep moving
their heads up and down.
06:35 - We are doing a measure for
showing the relationship
06:38 - between people and smartphone.
06:41 - You see puppet moving
their heads up and down.
06:43 - Just like, be constantly
checking the message
06:46 - from our smartphone.
06:48 - And once you remove the phone
06:50 - they go back to normal life.
06:52 - Just like this.
06:53 - - Hi, I'm Rebecca.
06:55 - Fluto is a life sized flute.
06:58 - And when you blow into your phone,
07:01 - the balls in the flutes go up.
07:03 - If you talk into the
microphone really loudly
07:06 - or you blow,
07:10 - then they go up.
07:14 - - Oh, I'm Joe Baker.
07:16 - This is my fan.
07:17 - I was inspired by the
Japanese folding fans.
07:21 - So, I decided just to
make a really large one.
07:24 - And make it express
itself through, you know,
07:27 - visuals and communicate with,
you know, digital world.
07:32 - - Hi, I'm Emily.
07:34 - I'm from Los Angeles.
07:36 - This is an interactive about how we can
07:39 - power our days using solar cell.
07:41 - And it tries to also detail some of the
07:43 - complexities of that process.
07:45 - So, this is the intro page
but we can power our days.
07:49 - And there are four different modules
07:51 - that people can experience.
07:53 - And one of the complexities
is the voltage generated.
07:57 - It's the voltage that can be generated
07:58 - from the solar panels.
08:00 - And you can see the relation
between the position
08:05 - of the house and the angle of the light
08:08 - and how that makes a difference.
08:10 - - My name is Sukanya and
the project is called
08:12 - merry go sound.
08:13 - So, there's eight spindles and these discs
08:17 - which have a sort of pattern on them,
08:19 - and each spindle is
assigned a different sound.
08:23 - So, as you place the discs
and try different combinations
08:26 - you can generate different melodies
08:27 - and different patterns and rhythms.
08:29 - - I'm Sarah.
08:30 - I'm from Boston or Brookline.
08:34 - - I'm Apoorva, I'm from Chicago.
08:37 - - Our project is an
interactive solar system.
08:40 - And what you would do is you would first,
08:43 - you have your little rocket ship.
08:45 - And you can select any planet
that you want to look at.
08:49 - And then you pick up
this little controller.
08:52 - And then move it around
and that will kind of--
08:55 - - [Reporter] Can we try one?
08:55 - - [Sarah] Yeah, sure, go ahead, yeah.
08:57 - And then that will control
the rotation of the planet.
09:02 - - [Reporter] It's working so well.
09:04 - - [Sarah] Yeah.
09:05 - - I'm Xiaotong from China
and this is my project.
09:09 - This is a sound instrument.
09:11 - And we can trigger some.
09:14 - And also change the
pitch at the same time.
09:17 - Like, you can see the water's decreased.
09:19 - (tapping on glass)
09:20 - The pitch will be different.
09:26 - - I'm Sachiko Nakajima from Japan.
09:28 - I'm first year ITP student.
09:30 - This is my ICM project.
09:33 - So, you can make paintings via sound.
09:37 - So, like a ringing here.
(bells ringing)
09:44 - Something like this, or.
09:47 - (seeds rattling)
09:52 - So, different timbre
generates different color.
09:56 - And the size of the paint
is based on that amplitude.
10:03 - (bossa nova music)
10:20 - - Hi, my name's Effy.
10:21 - And I'm showing my NIME, new
interface for music expression
10:25 - class project.
10:27 - My music instrument is called the War Fan.
10:30 - And then is a human body scale folding fan
10:35 - that opens up in two directions.
10:37 - I'm going to show you.
10:37 - This is one direction.
10:39 - This is the other direction.
10:40 - - [Reporter] Wow.
10:42 - - And then with the sensors attached to it
10:45 - there's accelerometer and a contact mic.
10:48 - It's picking up acoustic sound
10:50 - and then sending signals to the computer
10:52 - and then making different sound effects
10:56 - and synthesized music.
10:57 - - I'm Billy Bennett.
10:58 - And this is the Sand Ocean, as you said.
11:00 - So, I basically suspended
sand above a speaker.
11:05 - And the speaker vibrates
the air which moves the sand
11:09 - in interesting patterns and stuff.
11:11 - And different notes will
make it move more or less
11:14 - depending on how it resonates.
11:16 - Low notes move the sand more, so.
11:19 - - Wow.
- Yeah.
11:20 - - [Reporter] That's amazing.
11:22 - - I'm Atharva.
11:23 - - Hi, I'm Arnab.
11:24 - - Lilian.
11:25 - - Alright, so what did you make?
11:28 - - We made this thing which
is The mystery machine.
11:31 - It's a set of six or seven puzzles
11:34 - depending on how you play it.
11:35 - And there's a back story
to it about cat videos.
11:39 - So, there's a evil guy, Orion,
who's created this virus
11:42 - to destroy all cat videos on the internet.
11:45 - And we have a friend, Mitchell Guardsky
11:48 - who wrote the antivirus to that to save
11:50 - all the cat videos inside this machine.
11:52 - So, we want to plug the machine in,
11:54 - solve all of the puzzles and make sure
11:56 - we have cat videos for the internet.
12:00 - - Hi, my name is Alvin and
this is a project that I did.
12:02 - And the name of it is
called Space between us.
12:05 - It's a lighting installation.
12:06 - And it's composed of two
separate screens on each side.
12:09 - And also what I was saying
on both side they're
12:11 - have one side as a
window and the other side
12:14 - as a mirror.
12:19 - - Hey, my name is Hayk.
12:20 - This project called the
Invisible Orchestra.
12:22 - We made this with my colleague Brent.
12:25 - So, this is actually a
touchless musical instrument
12:28 - which is designed for performing artists
12:30 - to incorporate this
with their performances.
12:34 - So, it basically creates music with your
12:36 - body movement and your gestures.
12:38 - (synthesizer music)
12:50 - (bossa nova music)
