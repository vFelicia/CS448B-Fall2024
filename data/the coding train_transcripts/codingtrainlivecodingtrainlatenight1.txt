06:11 - are you
06:12 - oh my voice is so scratchy what's going
06:14 - on good thing I have a nice cup of
06:17 - herbal ginger tea here I don't know how
06:19 - the lighting is going here if you can
06:22 - see me this is an experiment welcome to
06:25 - the coding train late night show
06:35 - curmudgeonly alright well here I am
06:43 - embarking on a new experiment like just
06:48 - resetting the coding train these days
06:50 - first I was like I got a new studio I'm
06:54 - working at at NYU then I've got a new
06:57 - studio it's not really a studio it's a
06:59 - room in my home where I'm trying to
07:03 - livestream and then I kind of fell off
07:04 - the map there and now I'm back because I
07:08 - would really like to give you some very
07:13 - important information today I am
07:17 - announcing
07:19 - breaking coding trade dude trying to
07:25 - stream at night and see what happens my
07:27 - kids are well they're probably not
07:28 - asleep are you all asleep go to bed
07:31 - probably it actually might be waking up
07:36 - I'm seeing all these nice messages in
07:40 - the chat which is why whenever I look
07:41 - over here I'm looking at the chat so um
07:43 - here's the deal um I'm gonna try a new
07:45 - experiment which I'm going to stream I'm
07:47 - gonna have a coding train late night
07:48 - show which is what you're watching right
07:49 - now I may in fact next week have a coded
07:53 - train warnings show because I was
07:55 - thinking about all the the people who
07:58 - for whom it is 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. or 3
08:03 - a.m. or 6 a.m. this oddly might be a
08:05 - more convenient time for many of you I
08:07 - might have some first-time viewers here
08:08 - which oh my goodness if I have some
08:10 - first time boy am i sorry because I am
08:13 - not at all prepared basically I just got
08:18 - it together to turn all of the equipment
08:20 - on and be here talking to you and I do
08:25 - have some ginger tea but you know as
08:29 - those of you who are boy that slurping
08:32 - sound might be kind of annoying maybe I
08:33 - should mute my microphone whenever I do
08:35 - that those of you who have watched the
08:39 - coding train before no I like to get
08:42 - started with a reading from the coding
08:46 - train book well it's not the coding
08:48 - train book but it's one of my favorite
08:50 - books a million random duh digits it'd
08:55 - be nice if I could talk I was having so
09:00 - much regret about 9:15 p.m. tonight I
09:04 - was like oh I could just be like getting
09:06 - into my pajamas these bright lights on
09:12 - and microphone this and that hmm I'm the
09:16 - pleased to hear I just saw in the chat
09:17 - that it's 8:30 a.m. in India which is
09:19 - thrilling to me because I typically most
09:21 - of my livestream times I think actually
09:23 - have been in the middle of the night in
09:24 - in India and that part other other
09:27 - countries and areas in the world there
09:29 - at that same time zone
09:30 - I think Europe is really getting kind of
09:31 - the short end of the stick
09:34 - here alright so let's go and let's all
09:38 - just get settled in get get cozy if
09:41 - you're that night with your cup of tea
09:43 - and under the covers and have your like
09:45 - mobile device pressed against your eyes
09:47 - turn it off the light is bad for you go
09:50 - meditate breathe listen to some music
09:52 - actually let's see if I can manage to
09:55 - play this without getting a copyright
09:58 - strike well I don't get a copyright
10:00 - strike but a copyright claim or whatever
10:01 - it is that YouTube does when you play
10:02 - music but I have these wonderful Gold
10:07 - Goldberg Variations that I am going to
10:10 - play here it might be kind of loud
10:20 - let's turn the volume down a little bit
10:22 - with music judge amigos asking how do I
10:29 - skip a live stream to the next subject
10:31 - here's my suggestion to you right now
10:34 - become I probably don't come back
10:37 - tomorrow and watch it but at least if
10:40 - you come back tomorrow and watch it I
10:41 - will hopefully have some time codes in
10:43 - the description you could skip ahead to
10:45 - if I even get around to doing anything
10:51 - seventy-three thousand one hundred and
10:54 - ninety one thirty four thousand six
10:59 - hundred and seventy-six sixty-nine
11:02 - thousand two hundred and four ninety six
11:06 - thousand one hundred and seventy six by
11:08 - the way the new late-night coding train
11:10 - show is brought to you by the members of
11:13 - the coding train and if you would like
11:15 - to join with a membership today these
11:18 - lights behind me will blink we'll see
11:20 - we'll see if that works twelve thousand
11:24 - three hundred and eighty eight forty

16:29 - is no I by the way I didn't prepare for
16:33 - this by looking at code examples or
16:36 - signing it to any accounts or getting
16:37 - anything set up on this computer no I
16:39 - spent my brief amount of time preparing
16:42 - looking for music tracks and sound

17:02 - thank you for your super chat which is a
17:05 - really ridiculous thing if you think
17:07 - about it why are you paying me money I
17:09 - don't really deserve that money

21:06 - System Preferences let me see if I can
21:08 - turn off this what Oh
21:11 - hold on a second let me try to turn off
21:14 - this true tone nonsense which is really
21:16 - driving me crazy that I believe is in
21:23 - displays I am looking at my system
21:25 - preferences right now how it's taken me
21:27 - a very long time if I'd displays and
21:30 - color where is that silly true tone in
21:36 - color I thought it was under color ooh
21:38 - USB capture built-in retina ah true tone
21:41 - off hopefully this fixes it yeah yeah
21:44 - that fixed it
21:46 - alright okay
21:55 - true tone is off I believe that's
21:58 - correct I would like this to be a little
22:00 - bit bigger and so I want to do excuse me
22:04 - just have some more ginger tea I am
22:11 - going to do a countdown I'm going to do
22:14 - a heart firework and a midnight pumpkin
22:22 - alarm so when I say overly is over time
22:29 - not that I could speak during the day
22:30 - when I say overlays one of the things
22:32 - I've always wanted to have is things
22:36 - that pop up and appear in real time that
22:38 - are software-based
22:39 - in the live stream and this is something
22:40 - I can do because I'm using open
22:42 - broadcast studio and I can have a web
22:44 - page being elements and open across caps
22:46 - open broadcast studio that's over top of
22:49 - me and I can send signals to it by all
22:51 - sorts of networking fancy things so
22:53 - eventually I'm gonna get this hooked up
22:55 - as a discord bot and we can create
22:57 - fireworks I mean if you want to see what
22:59 - I'm to us so that's one for the things I
23:01 - want to work on I want to do lots of
23:04 - weird AI stuff this is by the way my
23:06 - summer plan I'm just forget about it
23:09 - like all of that stuff where I was
23:10 - making tutorials that made sense that
23:14 - were sequenced that you could follow in
23:16 - a curriculum like you were a student at
23:18 - a university who had to suddenly go home
23:20 - and you couldn't be in class anymore and
23:23 - you had to do all of your learning over
23:24 - the internet I'm done with that I
23:26 - thought a lot of that I'm just gonna be
23:29 - here every night at 11:00 p.m. keeping
23:34 - my children awake because I talk really
23:36 - loud although where they're sleeping is
23:39 - is quite far away I mean it's in the
23:41 - same home here in Brooklyn where I live
23:43 - I'm really excited by the way if it
23:45 - rains one of these nights if it rained I
23:47 - think the rain will be very loud where I
23:48 - am deep breath okay I believe that I got
23:53 - a new member
23:54 - I'm being told by my breaking news there
24:02 - is a new member of the coding train and
24:03 - that new member is arrest a Marcelino
24:06 - and I will say two rest day Marcelino
24:10 - you have one with your membership a
24:13 - random number from page 31 33 1798 and
24:20 - someday I will send you in the mail some
24:23 - stickers it will take me a long time to
24:26 - send them to you but I will send them to
24:28 - you eventually I hope I mean definitely
24:32 - please ask me about the stickers I got
24:35 - to get those out okay hmm so I want to
24:39 - do weird
24:39 - AI stuff so I want to train a GPT to
24:43 - model on all of my YouTube transcripts I
24:48 - want to train a style gain model on I
24:55 - don't know all of my YouTube thumbnails
24:57 - I could probably come up with a better
24:59 - idea there maybe I so those are some
25:04 - things I want to do I want to do some
25:06 - discord bot stuff which is related I
25:09 - want to do some a hue lights stuff I
25:13 - also want to do some vinyl cutting and
25:18 - plotter stuff you'll see that's coming
25:20 - Oh Pedro Pedro what are you doing to me
25:27 - here Pedro with your coding trade
25:31 - membership on the passenger's level you
25:35 - have won a the ability to like unlock
25:40 - some channels in our discord
25:42 - well my discord button work the discord
25:44 - is free and open to everybody there are
25:46 - way too many people watching this right
25:48 - now that's insane throw the fact that
25:52 - I'm basically doing nothing just sitting
25:54 - here and talking and feeling incredibly
25:57 - awkward and like uncomfortable
26:00 - I made these lights that are on me way
26:03 - too bright I just curiosity and maybe in
26:06 - the discord a live chat I might be
26:08 - helpful to hear do I look okay
26:11 - like I feel ridiculous that I'm wearing
26:13 - this tie but you know basically I live
26:16 - in my jogging shorts and t-shirts and I
26:19 - just feel like I don't know it's 10:30
26:21 - at night why don't I take a shower and
26:23 - get
26:23 - rest up I am wearing I should say though
26:25 - I mean pajama pants because I mean of
26:29 - course my kids got a real kick out of
26:35 - that
26:35 - they're like um why are you wearing a
26:37 - tie and pajama pants I mean I'm kind of
26:41 - a weirdo on the internet but I'm
26:43 - actually you can believe that looks
26:48 - great says Alka thank you I do by the
26:51 - way have a green screen and the ability
26:52 - to key myself out but I want to do stuff
26:55 - with the hue lights so while I have the
26:58 - hue lights behind me I'm going to do
27:01 - that can I do beard jokes if somebody
27:04 - could feed me in the in the discord Live
27:08 - members chat could feed me a joke I need
27:11 - a writer could I get like got some joke
27:12 - writers so I can come on jokes I
27:15 - actually asked my kids to write me some
27:17 - jokes and I didn't get anything good I
27:20 - mean I could go with the like why is is
27:24 - 8 the one that's afraid of 7 or 7 afraid
27:27 - of 8 I think 8 is afraid of 7 because 7
27:30 - ate 9 yeah thank you thank you I think
27:35 - this is more appropriate I made it too
27:38 - quiet now I can't hear my sound effects
27:41 - alright so hue lights discord bot
27:46 - control overlays oh I want a pole
27:50 - overlay live pole overlay I saw three
27:53 - blue one brown who was doing these on
27:55 - live sessions math lessons like
27:58 - basically and this is like internet
28:01 - weirdo just wasting time and three blue
28:03 - Browns live sessions was like inject
28:07 - this math knowledge directly into my
28:10 - brain someday I maybe I can achieve that
28:15 - kind of wonderfulness just court control
28:18 - overlays control hue lights and chat
28:23 - with Schiffman bots and this is at TBD
28:28 - and control from p5.js so this is what I
28:37 - planning to do and oh six is Afraid of
28:44 - seven six is the one Afraid of seven
28:47 - yeah eight not afraid of seven because
28:49 - say eight is that one of the people who
28:52 - eats I mean it's not a person it's a
28:54 - number
28:56 - nobody should give me a boot like by the
28:59 - way I have one two three four five
29:01 - different laughs sound effects and only
29:03 - one boo and then I realized the only
29:05 - thing appropriate for me to press is the
29:07 - boo let's try some more Goldberg
29:11 - Variations all right this is good so I
29:14 - think what would be good to do in the
29:18 - next half an hour before I turn into a
29:20 - pumpkin actually let's make the midnight
29:21 - pumpkin alarm I think if I can manage to
29:27 - make the midnight pumpkin alarm then I
29:30 - can have that be the overlay and it will
29:33 - go off at midnight so let's commit these
29:38 - and by the way this is a sincere
29:41 - invitation for everybody watching here
29:44 - to participate in this read me I'm not
29:49 - reading this github repository so the
29:51 - code that I'm doing will be in here
29:53 - maybe we can figure out a way that
29:55 - people can make variations of the
29:57 - overlays that I can use that up or I
29:59 - shall take contributions to them frankly
30:01 - to make them better because these are
30:03 - just projects that I'm working on that's
30:05 - a thing I mean I really should be
30:07 - streaming on do you think if I say that
30:12 - I should be streaming on Twitch tripe I
30:15 - should I got I should probably go get
30:17 - some aluminum foil or something because
30:19 - I don't know all right
30:22 - um so let's go to the P 5 editor we're
30:26 - getting slow start here I got a login
30:28 - coding tree excuse me while I look up my
30:32 - password opening up my generic password
30:44 - manager application you're welcome to
30:47 - sponsor me I might have some sponsors
30:50 - eventually for this I haven't alerted my
30:52 - I sort of like I said the coronavirus
30:56 - hit NYU semester was super busy I had to
30:59 - move all my equipment home I was like
31:00 - that no more sponsors please I cannot
31:03 - deal with this stress but maybe we'll
31:06 - see if this goes well it's helpful it's
31:08 - helpful every little bit counts what was
31:11 - I doing looking up a password oh okay
31:19 - editor seriously oh there it is here it
31:23 - is alright oh boy this is gonna this is
31:27 - gonna take me a bit fp1 seven eight
31:35 - exclamation point C M capital Q capital
31:44 - nine it's no such thing as a capital
31:46 - number this is not actually my password
31:48 - I'm saying random stuff as I'm typing
31:50 - and there we go
31:52 - yeah why not let's just go crazy here
31:54 - okay so I believe that at one point in
31:58 - my life
32:00 - I made a video tutorial oh boy the
32:05 - lights are the lights are blinking
32:06 - aren't they they're blinking they're
32:08 - blinking they're blinking no it's the
32:14 - other one a it just says a to me I'm
32:20 - sure you have a large longer name than a
32:23 - but in the view of my chat over here on
32:26 - the left your message is gone
32:29 - and it's highlighted at the top with the
32:31 - letter A and so as a is the first letter
32:35 - in the alphabet I will read you the
32:37 - first random number in this random
32:40 - number book really it's random number
32:43 - zero but a is not the zero number of the
32:46 - alphabet let a is a letter not a number
32:49 - my brain by the way does not work past
32:52 - 9:00 p.m. at night and this whole thing
32:54 - was
32:55 - terrible idea ten thousand and ninety
32:58 - seven all right okay
33:11 - so I made a tutorial a JavaScript timer
33:14 - or coding train and if I go here there
33:20 - were a couple of community contributions
33:24 - that you can see right over here and um
33:27 - thank you William and who says love your
33:30 - working love your work love your work
33:32 - know love your work I love your work oh
33:35 - I love your work yeah we all love each
33:37 - other's work isn't that nice all right
33:42 - let's get serious here so let's maybe
33:45 - start with this code and I'm gonna go to
33:47 - the web editor it's it's interesting it
33:52 - is using Dom elements you know what
33:55 - let's not start with this code let's
33:57 - make a full screen overlay here let's do
34:03 - it with canvas let's go canvassing so
34:06 - we're gonna do pumpkin alarm timer and
34:11 - first let's see can we in p5 very easily
34:15 - just get the current time that's
34:18 - probably an easy thing to do I think the
34:21 - functions to do that are hour and minute
34:24 - and second so let's see if I can say let
34:27 - our equal our know that can't possibly
34:31 - be right
34:32 - first of all it's giving me this really
34:35 - so hey you know it's bad so because if
34:43 - there is a function named our called our
34:45 - and p5 that's a global function I just
34:47 - named a variable called our and I'm
34:48 - totally just you know let's go to the
34:50 - reference so by the way if you've never
34:53 - seen p5 before hello here's the p5
34:56 - website p5 is a JavaScript library for
34:59 - creative coding that's a it's a way to
35:01 - describe it but I would say it's it's
35:03 - much more than that it is really a
35:05 - community of friendly welcome
35:08 - people who like to be creative and
35:10 - express themselves through code and if
35:12 - you're a beginner it's a great place for
35:14 - you to start so I'm gonna go to the
35:16 - reference I'm going to sort of search to
35:19 - see if I can find our indeed I was right
35:21 - let H equals our this would be a perhaps
35:25 - a better thing Oh a is the monetary unit
35:30 - sorry uh okay so the name of the the
35:42 - kind contribution was LX u VI a a dollar
35:47 - sign which must be some other is the is
35:50 - the monetary unit okay so let's go with
35:54 - let H equals our and I'm not in this
35:59 - sketch we're going to do that do you
36:04 - hear that there's there's a there's a
36:08 - wild animal in my house it's not a wild
36:10 - animal it's a cat its domesticated and
36:12 - her name is Greta Greta maybe she'll
36:15 - company I do have a dog cam but the dog
36:19 - is not there there's a nice little bed
36:21 - under here so if Gloria decides to I
36:24 - mean she's probably just totally conked
36:26 - out somewhere but maybe we can get her
36:28 - to say hello let m equal minute I can
36:31 - only assume it's minute let s equals
36:33 - second second second second minute
36:42 - second minute okay and now I'm just
36:46 - gonna close that sketch let's just see
36:49 - if I can get these on the street now one
36:51 - thing that I absolutely love one of my
36:53 - favorite things in life it's really a
36:55 - sad sad state of affairs in my life that
36:57 - I'm about to say this is a thing called
36:59 - a string literal and so I can make a
37:02 - what but this is I could say the time I
37:04 - could display the time by using a back
37:06 - tic and then I can have the value of a
37:08 - variable with dollar sign and these
37:11 - curly brackets then I can put in any
37:14 - other text that I want so I could say :
37:17 - dollar sign minute :
37:22 - dollar sign second oh here comes the cat
37:26 - this is a really exciting moment I never
37:30 - comes to me oh no I got you
37:33 - I think she is I guess I should go back
37:36 - to the full camera here so this is Greta
37:38 - she is a rescue kitten if that's a thing
37:42 - but a colleague of mine at NYU rescued a
37:46 - cat who gave birth to her and all the
37:48 - kittens were put up for adoption and
37:50 - Greta and her sister Evy came to live
37:52 - with us so she was born less than a year
37:54 - ago and I am getting template literal
37:58 - it's called a template am I even the
38:00 - thing that I love so much I'm saying the
38:01 - wrong name thank you to a new member oh
38:07 - my god so many new members I'm met maybe
38:12 - maybe the chat the members who are
38:16 - watching in discord could just collect
38:18 - the names and I'll do a kind of round of
38:20 - thanking at the end because I think it's
38:22 - sort of like a fun bit that I've got
38:24 - going on here but it kind of interrupts
38:26 - the flow I've got to stay within the
38:27 - blow template literal so this now if I
38:32 - say text time and I'm going to say text
38:38 - align Center Center oh oh I have a
38:43 - coding train color palette I have to
38:46 - look that up later I don't know where it
38:47 - is so I need to have that on hand so
38:49 - somebody to remind me so this is good so
38:51 - I can file the other thing people can do
38:53 - is help me file issues of things to
38:54 - remember
38:55 - so coding train color palette I need
39:01 - that on hand
39:02 - oh you're don't see my you don't see me
39:05 - coding sorry
39:06 - I need that on hand for easy access
39:08 - while streaming alrighty alrighty then
39:13 - is that a big is it back no it's not
39:17 - it's not I was thinking of having a
39:20 - contest for a coding train catch phrase
39:22 - which will not be alrighty then
39:25 - definitely not that okay there we go so
39:29 - back to here so here's my template
39:31 - literal I'm gonna write text align
39:33 - Center Center I know I know
39:35 - I know see the problem with the chat is
39:37 - you're way behind me I've already fixed
39:38 - it um recent member names Thank You Alka
39:43 - I might need those at the end I by the
39:46 - way I'm just gonna call it string
39:48 - literal because I think of it as a
39:49 - string literal but do you know maybe
39:51 - template literal makes sense because
39:52 - this is a template from which to make
39:55 - the string I don't know who cares we're
39:58 - going to say with / - height / - Phil
40:02 - 255 background 0 text size text size 128
40:17 - and let's see what we got here there we
40:21 - go oh boy look at this I got a clock so
40:24 - now how do I get this to be an overlay
40:28 - on my live stream right now oh boy this
40:31 - is super exciting also I this is really
40:36 - bothering me I need to number format
40:37 - these so I should say a number format I
40:41 - think it's 2 comma 0 like I don't want
40:45 - any decimal places so I want it always
40:47 - to be 2 digits but no decimal places I
40:49 - think that's what I want so let's do
40:54 - that to all these I really miss having
40:55 - my music going so let's see here well
41:04 - we're gonna have to wait until it gets
41:07 - to 0
41:09 - oh wait I got nowhere to be I've got 21
41:13 - minutes you know maybe the late night
41:15 - show should be in at 90 minutes
41:25 - yeah okay it worked
41:31 - excellent all right now how do I make
41:35 - this an overlay so first of all I can
41:37 - make this a transparent background by
41:40 - saying clear so in the draw loop if I
41:47 - call clear that is erasing resetting the
41:52 - background but setting it entirely
41:54 - transparent so whatever is behind on the
41:57 - webpage will be viewable so for example
42:00 - now if I go to file share and I think I
42:04 - want well full mode is a nice one to
42:08 - look at because now I can see this is my
42:10 - sketch Thank You Dustin welcome new
42:12 - member the lights are blinking I don't
42:18 - know it's the music too distracting I
42:19 - don't know so that's what's a little bit
42:21 - distracting for me this variation 3 oh
42:25 - ma I love variation for so good so so
42:35 - this is a thing I can now make happen in
42:38 - open broadcast studio so let's give me a
42:40 - moment and I'm gonna make that happen
42:42 - for you and for me what have I not
42:48 - played yet let's try this one
42:50 - all right everybody we're gonna get our
42:53 - first overlay
43:00 - all right so I have to go over here to
43:02 - this computer which you can't see
43:03 - unfortunately I should be able to wet I
43:05 - should figure out a way to bring my open
43:08 - oh I mmm I could bring my open broadcast
43:10 - studio in I'll do that another time so I
43:13 - am now going to go to my web browser and
43:17 - go to the p5 web editor login as coding
43:28 - train ah
43:40 - caps lock caps lock try to enter in by
43:51 - pet my master password for my password
43:53 - manager three times now and I can't seem
43:56 - to get it I got it
44:07 - try okay I'm in there let me get the URL
44:14 - I'm gonna open that sketch pumpkin alarm
44:18 - Tyner what a strange name for a sketch
44:21 - let me get the present full so this full
44:27 - mode is a nice idea you're about to see
44:32 - it going to add a browser
44:42 - pumpkin call this one pumpkin oh did you
44:47 - see that
44:47 - there you go see I've just so now you
44:49 - see so this is something I could do an
44:50 - open broadcast studio which I can add a
44:52 - browser source so now I'm gonna put in
44:54 - this page and I am going to say okay and
45:01 - there it is you can see it there it is
45:05 - now here's the thing and I want to like
45:10 - look at it so here it is
45:13 - this view of the p5 web editor has oh
45:18 - and I don't have any of the chats up
45:20 - right now because I messed everything up
45:22 - by going to the web browser so this this
45:30 - view of the web editor actually has a
45:32 - white background so the page itself is
45:34 - not transparent that is no good so what
45:36 - I really want is to look at and if I go
45:40 - back to this here what I really want to
45:43 - look at is not the full view but present
45:47 - so present view for the web editor just
45:51 - actually you can't see it because it's
45:52 - entirely white that was a bad idea
45:55 - but this actually just displays the web
45:58 - page with nothing the entire web page
45:59 - itself is transparent so that's the view
46:01 - that I want an open broadcast studio so
46:04 - I will now go over there and I'm going
46:06 - to hit edit what happened to the music
46:10 - okay and here we go up up I see some
46:16 - blinking lights by the way I never have
46:21 - this is a much higher viewership that I
46:23 - usually have which is a little bit
46:24 - insane to me let's go to properties
46:33 - we're going to change it to the present
46:36 - view there we go
46:41 - so now you see I have my overlay
46:48 - I can eat it that was weird and probably
46:57 - not a thing I should have done and would
47:00 - be good to end it out of this video
47:02 - which I can't because I'm live-streaming
47:03 - alright so now we know is the music too
47:09 - quiet so now we know now what out what
47:15 - should I do with this so now that I have
47:17 - the overlay and I guess I should put the
47:20 - overlay on this layout here so let's put
47:23 - the overlay in here to put in what was
47:27 - this a browser source add existing
47:31 - pumpkin by the way I spelled pumpkin
47:34 - pump pump Clin
47:44 - so here's the timer no bells and
47:48 - whistles here no frills but what I
47:52 - really need is I need to have something
47:55 - go nuts on the screen when it's midnight
48:00 - I need the screen to be full of pumpkins
48:03 - so I know that I have to go maybe I
48:06 - should turn into something that's not
48:07 - I'm not a pumpkin what would be a thing
48:11 - that I would turn into that's the
48:13 - equivalent if I were soda Cinderella
48:15 - turn into a pumpkin
48:16 - no the carriage turns into a pumpkin I
48:22 - don't know you only have 14 minutes here
48:25 - I did make a good list of interesting
48:28 - stuff to try we've already had the clock
48:32 - on the MacBook yeah but let's make the
48:35 - let's make it do some more interesting
48:36 - stuff so actually so now that I have
48:39 - this here let's let's let's make it
48:40 - fancier so let's do something like let's
48:45 - first figure out to make something
48:48 - happen when it's midnight if our equals
48:54 - 24 actually that's all I need to check
48:56 - right once it's 24 then I need pumpkin
49:04 - madness to happen I could Oh should we
49:09 - fire up runway and we could get a style
49:12 - gain model make us like an AI generated
49:15 - pumpkin
49:16 - can we do that in 13 minutes no like why
49:22 - not try okay hold on
49:28 - I got to do some I got to get how do I
49:32 - get a collection I think I'm gonna have
49:34 - to save this time but we could just
49:37 - start clock takes over the screen with
49:39 - Perlin noise well one thing that could
49:43 - one thing that might be nice to actually
49:45 - look at right now is how to do some
49:46 - image scraping which I have done before
49:52 - Google Image Python if I'd done this
49:56 - with node oh I'm gonna have to have an
50:05 - API key no thank you
50:11 - you know it would be good if only we're
50:14 - was a web series about web scraping here
50:34 - it is so this is a work in progress
50:37 - guide to web scraping as an artistic and
50:40 - critical practice created by Sam Levine
50:42 - you can sign up for this letter and you
50:46 - can also go through all these tutorials
50:52 - I might have to look at this and come
50:53 - back to it alright let's let's not worry
50:55 - about training our own machine learning
50:57 - model oh wait I have an idea
51:03 - let's open up runway oh I'm gonna have
51:08 - to log in here
51:13 - [Music]
51:17 - h equals zero
51:20 - [Music]
51:27 - i'd like to do some weird stuff so i
51:29 - should probably explain more what runway
51:32 - is alright alright everybody let's get
51:41 - my password again this is the worst i
51:44 - think it'll keep me logged in after
51:46 - today how do I find it search which one
52:01 - is it I have two accounts that's not
52:03 - good
52:16 - did that work all right browse models
52:19 - let's look for attention Gann so a
52:24 - runway is browse models browse models
52:30 - whoa oh I've heard about this model ok
52:34 - let's turn this music off here these so
52:37 - we're gonna have to do some we're gonna
52:39 - have to try a lot of these models
52:40 - because this stuff is pretty insane so
52:43 - runway is a an application that allows
52:50 - you to run a variety of recent machine
52:56 - learning models and connect those models
52:59 - with all sorts of other creative tools
53:02 - and applications thank you again
53:06 - and so I I should I should say that you
53:13 - know I'm not entirely showing this to
53:15 - you out of the goodness of my own heart
53:16 - I do enjoy and love runway I happen to
53:19 - be an advisor to the company and so it's
53:23 - a project that I have that I feel
53:25 - invested in personally and that I that I
53:27 - use for my teaching but I want to browse
53:29 - models and I want to go to attention
53:32 - Gann text to image generation so let's
53:38 - let's let's try this I don't know what
53:41 - workspace I'm in here but I'm just going
53:44 - to put in a little text here and I'm
53:45 - going to type in the word pumpkin so
53:47 - what attention Gann what the machine
53:49 - attention Gann model does is it uses
53:51 - something called a generative
53:53 - adversarial network or Gann and it it's
53:56 - trained with images that are tied to
53:59 - different to words so it's been trained
54:03 - all these the late the training data was
54:06 - images that are labeled so now if you
54:09 - feed it a a word it you can have it
54:14 - generate an image related to that word
54:15 - so let's see what happens if I run this
54:17 - model and I should have seven minutes
54:26 - and I don't I have a coupon code for
54:29 - people to use
54:30 - runway I need to get that is it is it
54:33 - going pumpkin pumpkin patch wha
54:49 - hmm Oh Oh Thomas Atkins is so right it's
54:53 - a string and I'm comparing it why is
54:57 - this not working I'm not very satisfied
55:13 - it's do I need to just type more stuff
55:16 - there are a bunch I see oh yeah I see a
55:20 - lot of pumpkins I guess I need a
55:22 - sentence law Oh
55:25 - oh it's got this is gonna give us
55:27 - nightmares this is a very bad idea
55:30 - happy pumpkins are delicious I guess it
55:38 - wants sentences so by the way you know I
55:41 - it's one thing to just Oh God
55:44 - play around and enjoy machine learning
55:47 - models and and just like experiment and
55:50 - have fun and that's really what I'm
55:51 - doing here but I would say that you know
55:54 - if I wanted to be if I didn't have this
55:57 - like time work above my head I don't
55:59 - want to be more thoughtful about this
56:00 - I'd probably want to go back to the the
56:04 - attention Gann model and we should
56:14 - really know how to use runway and I want
56:18 - to learn more so the attention can model
56:21 - I can here take a look at the
56:24 - attributions I can read a little
56:26 - paragraph about it there's usually a
56:27 - paper the link to with the paper for the
56:31 - model yeah here we go github repository
56:33 - and the research paper or down here so
56:35 - those would be those would be good let's
56:38 - let's see I have an idea so this would
56:40 - be much more fun if like I could get
56:46 - something from like the YouTube chat
56:47 - late night pumpkin party is a pretty
56:49 - good from Yosh in the chat so let's go
56:51 - back to runway a workspaces no training
56:56 - exports hosted mouse I need to host a
56:59 - model yes
57:01 - yes
57:05 - so I need to host this model attention
57:11 - Gann to no tension again no I let's get
57:13 - rid of this one delete let's go back to
57:17 - attention Gantt yeah yeah yeah now we're
57:20 - gonna try pumpkin late night pumpkin
57:24 - party on the coding train minutes oh
57:34 - well anyway so we see that this works
57:36 - now how do I deploy this model Network
57:40 - host this model this is exactly what I
57:43 - want to do so I'm gonna click host this
57:45 - model no cancel okay so this is
57:54 - something if I were recording a proper
57:55 - video tutorial I would do some
57:57 - post-production and and now the thing is
57:59 - I believe it costs something like 0.0001
58:03 - cent for every query on the model don't
58:07 - quote me on that it's like 0-0 want
58:09 - something like that small amount and I
58:12 - don't want you to have the endpoint for
58:15 - this model because you could flood it
58:18 - and I would end up spending a large
58:20 - amount of money so did I spell pumpkin
58:23 - incorrectly it doesn't matter right now
58:25 - so the point is I'm going to here in my
58:28 - fancy system go over to here and now you
58:33 - can't see my screen so I'm now gonna go
58:35 - to hosting the model subdue did it
58:38 - change it can I can change it ah so all
58:48 - right good luck guessing this good luck
58:50 - guessing the end point I created for
58:52 - this host model it's private and oh you
59:01 - already saw some other oh I have to read
59:04 - hold on I gotta edit something Oh
59:06 - actually I could also just deactivate it
59:08 - later alright so let's get this model
59:13 - I've got the endpoint for the model I'm
59:17 - gonna go back to my workspace I'm sorry
59:22 - that you can't see what I'm doing and
59:24 - I'm going to get some JavaScript code
59:33 - and here we go
59:41 - Oh little boy okay got it alright so
59:49 - I've got my code and I'm gonna go back
59:52 - so you can see what I'm coding Here I am
59:57 - going to get a get pumpkin function
60:04 - called get pumpkin we're not who's not
60:06 - happening people but if I get this done
60:08 - by 1:00 a.m. it'll still work and I know
60:12 - this needs to say like this basically
60:15 - now which is super annoying but I'll
60:18 - just leave it that way you'll all
60:20 - improve this for me let's add a function
60:22 - called get pumpkin and for right now
60:28 - what I'm going to do in runway is I'm
60:30 - actually just gonna run the model the
60:32 - models running locally so I can test
60:35 - this locally and when I change the code
60:36 - I can put in my private secret endpoint
60:39 - so let's put this in here and see what
60:43 - I've got here now what this is doing is
60:45 - it is basically I have a caption that
60:49 - I'm gonna send to the model which is
60:51 - like late night pumpkin party on the
60:56 - coding train exclamation point then I'm
61:00 - going to use the fetch function I have a
61:03 - whole set of videos about fetch if
61:05 - you've never heard of that function it
61:07 - allows me to fetch data from a server
61:10 - runway which is this application running
61:12 - on machine is actually running on a
61:13 - server if you're a beginner I've really
61:15 - apologized I could give you like a whole
61:17 - playlist of things to watch to like sort
61:20 - of fill in all the gaps of like the
61:21 - stuff that I'm just sort of like
61:22 - stitching together right now but
61:26 - actually I think what I want to do which
61:28 - I think would be a little bit friendlier
61:30 - is use HTTP POST which is a function
61:34 - that's in p5 so I'm going to go back to
61:37 - p5 reference feel so feel so so quiet
61:46 - we're gonna go to the p5 reference yes
61:49 - the reference
61:52 - here we are the reference I'm gonna go
61:55 - to HTTP POST and I'm going to see what
62:02 - it looks like
62:03 - so I remember how this works I need a
62:06 - URL I need to say I'm sending JSON
62:08 - you'll know know and the data so let's
62:12 - do this I'm going to post to the URL
62:18 - which is this and I am going to post to
62:28 - that URL JSON I'm gonna post the inputs
62:32 - that's the data and then I have a got
62:35 - image so I can get rid of all this code
62:41 - which uses a sink and a weight or
62:44 - promises or who knows what it's using
62:45 - fancy arrow functions and I could just
62:48 - have this nice p5 HTTP POST function
62:52 - which says hey this URL that's the
62:55 - runway server that's running locally on
62:57 - my computer right here right now because
63:00 - this thing is going and this is the
63:06 - caption I'm sending it to it I'm sending
63:09 - the data this data with JSON format and
63:12 - when it's done got image should have the
63:18 - results let's just console.log the
63:20 - results let's so let's see if this works
63:22 - oh but actually in set setup let's just
63:26 - call get pumpkin pumpkin I kind of wish
63:33 - my dog's name was pumpkin because then I
63:35 - could do some kind of joke ya know okay
63:43 - let's see what happens all right awesome
63:47 - this is a really good sign look at all
63:50 - this insanity beautiful beautiful so
63:54 - what is this this is a base64 encoded
63:59 - image oh oh so much to explain and talk
64:02 - about it might be actually a little bit
64:04 - easier for me to see it in the
64:05 - javascript console oh it's doing it it's
64:08 - midnight and good night everybody
64:18 - sorry that's all we got to today I gotta
64:19 - go no I'm gonna stick this one out I
64:22 - mean some I feel like I I like I like
64:25 - rules and systems and I like following
64:28 - those rules and I like knowing what the
64:30 - rules are and I like knowing what the
64:31 - systems are and how to deal with we'd
64:38 - like to have a rule that come midnight
64:40 - I'm out of here but let's let's see if
64:42 - we can get this a little bit more so the
64:47 - result is an object that actually has a
64:50 - property called result so maybe I don't
64:52 - want to call it result and that's the
64:54 - base64 encoded image so I don't want to
64:58 - look at the console right now I don't
65:00 - want it to do this over and over again
65:02 - let's comment this out get pumpkin let's
65:07 - put it in here I just want to do it once
65:10 - at the start can you see what I'm doing
65:12 - here my probably I really should do my
65:15 - whole green screening thing and I looks
65:21 - like XD out of the corner of my eye some
65:23 - blinking lights thank you to Singapore
65:25 - wow so this is runway let's just call
65:36 - this message reply I can't figure out
65:40 - what to call it
65:41 - JSON reply and I think if I just say
65:47 - create image this is a function in p5
65:51 - that creates a Dom element but I buy
65:56 - that like so there's a canvas in p5
65:58 - which is a Dom element document object
66:00 - model that's what Dom stands for as all
66:01 - the things are on the webpage and but I
66:04 - don't I want to draw that image be able
66:05 - to the canvas but I just want to see it
66:07 - right now on the web page so this I
66:08 - think will work if I now say JSON reply
66:11 - dot result and let's make this just 400
66:15 - by 400 just briefly there
66:19 - so here it is there is the late-night
66:22 - coding train party pumpkin party we've
66:30 - got the image there so I think what I
66:32 - want to do is there's probably a better
66:36 - way of doing this but let's just create
66:37 - a variable called pumpkin Park this is
66:45 - not what I intended to make tonight
66:48 - pumpkin party is false so if H is 0 then
66:53 - that pumpkin party is true pumpkin party
66:58 - equals true and then so as long as it's
67:05 - that and not pumpkin party this will
67:08 - ensure that we only do it once then I
67:11 - get the pumpkin so now I'm gonna take
67:14 - this out of setup because the time is
67:16 - midnight right now this should work
67:19 - right we've got the O create image was
67:22 - expecting at least two arguments but
67:24 - received only one I don't know what I
67:32 - don't know what to tell you I do want to
67:35 - do this though
67:39 - pumpkin image oh no no no no I see I see
67:43 - what I want to do image ready so I'm
67:49 - gonna create so when the image is ready
67:53 - must have a callback I assume I want to
67:57 - say this must be the Dom oh no no no
68:00 - yeah oh really
68:03 - let's do this let image equal create
68:07 - image and then oh this is bad so I was
68:15 - going to I had this idea that I would
68:17 - just put all the creepy pumpkin images
68:19 - all over the screen yeah I could use
68:22 - absolute positioning that's what I could
68:24 - do so let's do that let's leave them as
68:26 - Dom elements and we'll do a position
68:28 - which is a random with random
68:31 - Haight and then we're going to get
68:35 - another pumpkin so we're gonna do this
68:36 - over and over again until I turn it off
68:40 - so this is a the p5 Dom library allows
68:44 - you to position Dom elements let's go
68:46 - back to a window width and window height
68:52 - and let me just move this over here so
68:55 - we have more room to see and I think
68:57 - what this should do
68:58 - syntax error you can't really see that
69:00 - after line 17 let me just let you should
69:02 - see the entire laptop right now I'm
69:07 - missing a parenthesis here let's try
69:09 - this
69:11 - where are my pumpkins all right let's
69:18 - let's debug this let's get rid of this
69:21 - image ready a console.log image am I
69:29 - getting that Dom element oh yeah whoa oh
69:32 - boy whoa oh it's always gonna be the
69:36 - same image okay
69:40 - so there's an issue here I like I think
69:44 - I should by the way set timeout get
69:47 - pumpkin 500 like let's not let's not
69:53 - have the pumpkins go crazy so now that
69:59 - this is not that exciting because it's
70:01 - the same pumpkin image every time so I
70:05 - think what I need to do is let's go look
70:08 - at the model so is there is there like a
70:12 - random C I don't think so that's not
70:15 - this is not really like a latent space
70:17 - where I could kind of just tweak some
70:19 - values or a seed I'm not I think it's
70:24 - this is like every text input is going
70:26 - to have an exact fixed output so I think
70:28 - what I need to do is generate the text
70:31 - so the text is different every time
70:34 - why don't we do that as let's just do
70:39 - that as let's create word let's let's
70:41 - just make word salad pumpkin
70:45 - pajamas party late night coding trained
70:57 - so let's take this array and shuffle it
71:01 - so if I say console.log words in setup
71:06 - it's gonna give me oh why is it giving
71:10 - me this I guess it really wants a
71:12 - callback let's look at the reference for
71:19 - create image reference create image oh
71:29 - oh I am so wrong about this that second
71:35 - argument is really important and really
71:37 - should be required so that's the alt
71:42 - text so a web page is not accessible to
71:46 - people who use a screen reader to browse
71:49 - the Internet to browse web pages if
71:51 - there's not alt Texel or turn on
71:53 - alternative text for images so if you
71:55 - can't see the image you can hear a
71:57 - description of it so that's actually
71:58 - really really important to include and I
72:00 - deeply apologize for just kind of and
72:04 - I'm so glad that p5 gives that error
72:05 - message just as a reminder so I am now
72:08 - it's 12:10 a.m. I really need to go to
72:12 - bed don't let the tie mislead you that I
72:15 - like awake and I'm having a good time
72:18 - I'm here on the internet with all of my
72:20 - friends yeah alright a JSON reply result
72:26 - and so this could be the caption so
72:32 - let's say let caption is so let me let
72:39 - me comment out this get pumpkin for a
72:41 - second so one of the things I want to
72:43 - see is how do i quickly shuffle this
72:46 - array line 18 I've got an error and I'm
72:49 - sorry I've got to get my system better
72:51 - here so I'm gonna put in a second
72:54 - argument in a minute so that's the array
72:57 - down here if if I
72:59 - shuffle the array is there a is there a
73:03 - JavaScript function that shuffles an
73:05 - array like can I say words dot shuffle
73:11 - it's not function
73:18 - let's do javascript array methods and
73:22 - let me come back in here I like to look
73:26 - at this page so there really isn't like
73:29 - one of these isn't uh just shuffle it I
73:33 - I'm having like a total deja basically
73:37 - my life is just is just destined to
73:40 - repeat the same discussion in every
73:43 - single video and live stream that I do
73:46 - so I mean I get easily right well I
73:49 - don't want to cut myself on that you
73:54 - know cheek too much but you know I could
73:57 - write my own shuffle algorithm let's do
73:59 - that I'm sure one of you watching this
74:03 - especially if you do those like coding
74:05 - game challenge it's good right for me in
74:07 - one line of code but I'm going to take
74:09 - it slow and we have another new member
74:12 - this is pretty amazing I'm gonna take it
74:15 - slow here and I'm gonna write a function
74:18 - call it shuffle it's gonna receive an
74:20 - array and I'm just gonna do a swap I'm
74:23 - gonna say I'm totally done this so many
74:27 - times I really should keep a library
74:29 - functions that I reuse so I want a to be
74:37 - and I want B so I'm picking two indices
74:41 - into the array ik I'm not guaranteeing
74:43 - that they're not the same but you know
74:47 - it'll good enough for now so two indices
74:50 - into the array I want to take the value
74:55 - a and store it because I want a to be
74:58 - what B is and I want B to be what a is
75:04 - and now this array is shuffled thousand
75:08 - shuffles is plenty I'm sure way more
75:11 - than I need for ran
75:12 - musician and now I could say shuffle
75:17 - words and if I run the sketch pumpkin
75:21 - pajamas party late mmm that didn't seem
75:25 - to work
75:35 - if I've had shuffle possibly because
75:38 - your code is already using that name as
75:40 - a variable huh scramble
75:54 - ooh no that's not right
76:00 - that's not right
76:01 - Oh No so the whole point of this is I
76:04 - need this DB temp so the point of this
76:08 - with the swap was to save what's in a
76:11 - put that in B and then because now that
76:15 - a is what B is I got to go back to what
76:17 - I saved to put that back in hang okay
76:19 - yes and making a new array and returning
76:22 - it all those things could make more
76:23 - sense okay
76:24 - so then so caption could equal words dot
76:32 - join let's just join all the words with
76:34 - a space I don't know let's add a period
76:36 - at the end and then I'm gonna do this
76:42 - every single time actually I should just
76:44 - do it and get pumpkin so this can be a
76:47 - local variable I don't need a global
76:51 - variable caption I don't need to do this
76:53 - here so basically every time I want to
76:57 - get a pumpkin I scramble the words I
76:59 - mean there's only so many possibilities
77:01 - like how many ways can you shuffle an
77:04 - array with one two three four five six
77:08 - what seven things in it that would be 7
77:10 - factorial right which is others 5,000
77:14 - ways so that's pretty good I think that
77:16 - my math is right there because there's
77:17 - seven things seven possibilities and six
77:20 - possibilities and five possibilities and
77:21 - four so seven times five yeah alright so
77:23 - now let's see what happens if I get
77:27 - pumpkin again fail to fetch why oh well
77:39 - first of all this should be this
77:46 - type error failed to fetch Oh am I not
77:50 - running the model anymore oh yeah it's
77:52 - not running so I think runway because
77:55 - running the runway runs these machine
77:59 - learning models in the cloud you can
78:00 - sometimes run them locally and there's a
78:03 - fee for running them in the cloud so I
78:06 - think runway if you haven't used it
78:08 - after like 10 minutes it shuts it off
78:10 - okay so now let's try and let's see what
78:14 - we get all right late night pumpkin
78:26 - party I kind of want I should probably
78:34 - like use some CSS to set these like
78:36 - slightly transparent and like do cool
78:38 - stuff with them but I think I'm gonna
78:40 - pause for right now so now all I need to
78:42 - do is I need to go back to here and I
78:47 - need to well first of all so and I need
78:50 - to change so I'm gonna go let me show
78:53 - you so I need to change this too now I
78:56 - deploy runway allows me to take the
78:59 - model that I'm running locally on my
79:01 - computer and deploy it to a server and
79:03 - then there's a fee for every query to it
79:05 - and so I am going to change this from
79:10 - localhost to the endpoint of my model
79:13 - but I don't want you to see the endpoint
79:15 - so I'm gonna do that while I'm just in
79:20 - the camera view so bear with me for a
79:24 - second I download all this new music I
79:27 - don't know where any of it is alright
79:34 - got some suspense going on here am I
79:37 - going to be able to get this to work
79:43 - all right
79:46 - stopping running the model locally
79:49 - hosted models gonna copy my endpoint I'm
79:56 - just replacing again whoops all I'm
79:59 - doing is replacing this right here with
80:03 - the endpoint that I'm getting from
80:04 - runway and then I'm going to test to
80:10 - make sure it works work
80:16 - what did I miss error hold on let's look
80:22 - at the air
80:31 - [Music]
80:36 - all right I'm gonna let you in on the
80:40 - air here comes the air ah there's the
80:44 - point there it is well here's my end
80:48 - point I couldn't get it to work anyway
80:59 - I'm gonna change the end point now that
81:04 - you all see it by the way I think
81:10 - there's some breaking news right here on
81:16 - the coding train coming to you live I
81:19 - hear from Jeff that p5.js has a function
81:23 - coach which is why I couldn't name my
81:26 - variable shuffle and I didn't have to
81:28 - write my own function call shuffle
81:29 - because it shuffles it anyway okay now
81:36 - we can see it on the website oh yeah of
81:39 - course there's no way I'm hiding this
81:42 - from you this was a failed attempt at
81:44 - hiding my eyes this is the very failed
81:48 - attempt at hiding I don't really care
81:49 - right now
81:50 - good luck I mean I can I can turn it off
81:55 - but like why error unauthorized I must
82:01 - have to do something what did I forget
82:05 - that's weird well thank you very much
82:11 - for tuning in to this live stream let me
82:14 - at least deactivate it I will resolve
82:20 - this issue well I just want to see some
82:25 - pumpkin images show up on the overlay
82:27 - this is so sad alright let's make it do
82:30 - something else I'm gonna resolve this
82:32 - other issue I've got too many thing
82:34 - issues which one is like I can't get it
82:37 - to work
82:38 - two is actually I could just run it
82:45 - locally on the Oh this is all very silly
82:50 - so I can't get it to work I also can't
82:52 - figure out how to like do this without
82:54 - everybody having access to the endpoint
82:56 - oh I need a token right credentials
83:00 - oh I've gotten I've done this before
83:03 - okay hold on give me a second everybody
83:13 - as you were of course they need the
83:16 - credentials so silly so silly I'm gonna
83:24 - get those credentials I know how to do
83:38 - it I forgot so I need headers and the
84:09 - headers have
84:15 - I'm looking at the wrong one
84:22 - I'm gonna show this to you while not
84:27 - showing you the authorization so so this
84:32 - here is actually if I go in the runway
84:35 - interface and I go to the cloud hosted
84:38 - model the code includes headers so I
84:43 - need to have a token under authorization
84:46 - and it's a secret code in order for me
84:48 - to access it which I could hide that
84:51 - code in an environment variable or sakis
84:55 - file if I were running a node server and
84:57 - doing all this stuff correctly but I'm
85:01 - just gonna get it to work and all you
85:04 - hack errs out there you're gonna get
85:06 - that code but it doesn't matter to me
85:08 - shut it death suits it worked the first
85:10 - time around shut this I'm gonna pull
85:12 - this train over to the side of the road
85:15 - which would probably be very dangerous
85:16 - to do that with a train alright okay
85:21 - everybody you can't see that you can't
85:23 - see it but I can see it and I'm grabbing
85:28 - it
85:29 - I'm going into p5 I'm narrating what I'm
85:32 - doing and I'm in my get pumpkin function
85:43 - and I am putting in some new code
85:53 - and I'm going to say
86:03 - give me a second here
86:10 - okay
86:16 - activating my model this is I think this
86:20 - is worth it
86:23 - okay good shape here
86:30 - okay
86:44 - give me a second here everybody
86:46 - [Music]
87:02 - but I think I don't like its refresh
87:09 - browser and scene becomes active okay
87:12 - here we go everybody uh yeah wait hold
87:18 - on okay
87:51 - thank you everyone for watching this
87:58 - episode we stopped this year of the
88:05 - coding train it's midnight and we're
88:11 - having a pumpkin party here end this
88:23 - thank you all for watching the coding
88:25 - train here moves the time update to the
88:29 - bottom of the loop here I am okay wait I
88:34 - have to fit wherever okay so thank you
88:37 - for watching this I will be back to
88:47 - continue this insanity that I'm on and I
88:54 - appreciate you get into the fetal
88:59 - position and dry
89:01 - I know the time should appear on top
89:03 - right I'm trying to get to
89:13 - and tomorrow today we finished oh wait
89:20 - hold on
