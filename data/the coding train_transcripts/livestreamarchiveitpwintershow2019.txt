00:02 - um
00:05 - oh you know what would be good hello we
00:07 - might be live streaming right now
00:10 - um are there captions that are appearing
00:12 - obviously nobody's looking at the chat
00:14 - so we do have a little bit of a bug in
00:16 - our system
00:17 - um here what i'm going to do is say i
00:19 - have it up on my computer over there so
00:20 - first let me say a quick hello just
00:22 - assuming it's working
00:24 - but yeah if somebody has a phone and
00:26 - wants to like just go to it you'll be
00:27 - able to see the live chat
00:29 - um my name is dan schiffman
00:31 - this is a live stream that's happening
00:33 - on a youtube channel called the coding
00:34 - train but this is a little bit of a
00:35 - special episode in that
00:38 - um we i'm going to show you the itp ima
00:42 - winter show so it i itv is a graduate
00:44 - program ima has an undergraduate program
00:46 - at new york university school of the
00:48 - arts it's where i teach where i make a
00:50 - lot of the video tutorials that i have
00:51 - on the channel
00:52 - um
00:54 - people are saying the captions are there
01:02 - and so
01:04 - um we're going to walk around there's
01:05 - all there's like
01:06 - literally six of us here right now and
01:08 - we have the most elaborate setup ever so
01:11 - there's this microphone i should i
01:13 - should point out that this microphone is
01:15 - not actually something that you're
01:16 - hearing right now this is just recording
01:18 - backup additional audio it's actually
01:20 - probably way too close to my face right
01:21 - now it should be more about here
01:23 - this phone attached to it is also on a
01:27 - skype call with a live captioner give
01:29 - yourself a shout out live capture in the
01:31 - live captions who is live captioning i
01:34 - have a feeling the live captions aren't
01:35 - going to work so well this is the first
01:36 - time we're trying to do it but we're
01:38 - going to do our best and then the actual
01:40 - audio that you're hearing
01:42 - i'm tapping the mic so hopefully you
01:43 - heard like there's messages coming in so
01:47 - what i'm going to do right now is i'm
01:48 - going to
01:50 - take this
01:52 - prop which is like our microphone
01:54 - speaker it's like this what's the thing
01:56 - where you have like the speaker box or
01:58 - the
01:58 - you know when you're at like a meeting
02:00 - and you want people to speak one of the
02:01 - times you have to hold
02:03 - oh it's the top one the talking stick
02:05 - this is the talking stick
02:07 - which we will pass around um so i'm
02:09 - going to pass over these are our student
02:11 - show producers
02:13 - um
02:14 - i'm going to let them introduce
02:15 - themselves and talk about the show and
02:17 - idp and what it is and whatever they
02:19 - want and i'm going to go check just sort
02:21 - of like the the analytics page and the
02:23 - chat and all that make sure things are
02:24 - and then we'll start looking at projects
02:26 - thank you to ellen behind the camera
02:29 - chelsea and jesse over here are helping
02:32 - and i'll hand this to you bye
02:35 - hi everyone i'm i'm patrick warren i'm a
02:36 - first year itp student
02:39 - hi i'm daphne i'm second year itp
02:41 - student i'm a lighting designer cool
02:44 - and uh so i guess we'll walk outside and
02:45 - check out the show right so we're gonna
02:47 - say what we're doing oh what we're doing
02:54 - doing whatever they want we did a
02:56 - beautiful map together of all of the
02:58 - projects on the floor this year special
03:00 - because we have a beautiful space and we
03:03 - have more than 100 projects
03:05 - so that's a lot of projects to go
03:06 - through for a visitor so we made a map
03:08 - that has
03:09 - numbers laid out on a floor plan and
03:11 - then a description no not a description
03:13 - the name of the project the student and
03:16 - you know it's color coded according to
03:17 - where it is in the
03:19 - so that was our job yeah
03:22 - do you want to add anything i think she
03:23 - is
03:25 - so that's it
03:26 - should we go look at some projects let's
03:28 - go
03:41 - okay
03:43 - i'm like so like i don't have my phone i
03:45 - don't have my phone
03:46 - because it's over there
03:48 - um
03:49 - so
03:50 - i guess i'll take this now and i'll i'll
03:52 - get us rolling and then we can kind of
03:53 - like
03:54 - alternate around
03:56 - all right so we're gonna attempt now to
03:57 - look at projects students are still
03:58 - setting up their projects
04:00 - um but uh maybe
04:02 - is the boxing glove in action
04:05 - all right let's go check out the boxing
04:07 - glove
04:09 - so uh what we're going to attempt to do
04:12 - is um
04:14 - so ellen i think like the closer you get
04:17 - okay the better just for the audio
04:19 - and then um you can we're gonna like
04:22 - keep the camera on you and the mic on
04:24 - you just to do like describe the project
04:26 - and then separately you can demo it
04:28 - because as soon as we're trying to like
04:30 - shoot video of demoing it we'll lose
04:32 - your audio sure okay
04:34 - say your name and your project and then
04:36 - a few sentences about it uh hi my name
04:40 - is punch punch revolution basically what
04:44 - it is is a machine learning gesture
04:46 - classifier on the under the hood but on
04:49 - the hood if as you can see it's a fun
04:52 - punching game where you need to complete
04:53 - a certain amount of tasks in a limited
04:55 - amount of time
04:56 - uh the entire technology is happening
04:59 - inside this very small thing over here
05:01 - as a demo
05:02 - and if somebody wants to try it out we
05:04 - can have a go at it
05:08 - should i try or do you want to
05:09 - demonstrate oh i can demo it yeah okay
05:16 - so basically if i need to make a
05:18 - significant enough gesture ideally it
05:21 - should
05:36 - so that's how it roughly books and the
05:38 - general purpose of the entire project is
05:41 - to
05:42 - uh
05:43 - go into us like early deep dive into
05:45 - like what can be possible just using
05:48 - people's gestures as a medium of
05:50 - interaction
06:03 - okay
06:10 - all right so
06:11 - introduce yourself say your names and a
06:13 - few sentences about your project
06:15 - hi my name is
06:20 - and this is our project
06:22 - general photography so basically it's an
06:25 - experiment we did like to figure out
06:27 - what's in between analog photography and
06:30 - digital technology so what you're seeing
06:32 - now is
06:34 - the result of our experiment
06:37 - so we ran a journey through from the
06:40 - very basic analog photography
06:44 - the pinhole cameras where you expose
06:46 - a piece of light sensitive paper to
06:49 - light over a certain period of time and
06:51 - then you can capture out light expose
06:54 - the paper
06:55 - and how it carves these like
06:58 - the traces of line on this piece of
07:00 - paper and then we try to reproduce the
07:03 - same process by using a digital way so
07:05 - basically for example we have a series
07:08 - of images
07:09 - and then we use the technique that is
07:12 - used in analog photography to expose a
07:14 - digital canvas with the images from that
07:17 - series of
07:20 - maybe for example for a performance in a
07:22 - dense
07:23 - images from a dance performance and then
07:25 - we did the negative
07:27 - analog negative of that these printed
07:30 - results which turn out
07:32 - you could have like this
07:34 - a piece of photography which is
07:37 - digital based but it has the texture and
07:39 - aesthetics of an analog photography and
07:42 - here's the video showcasing
07:44 - like the digital exposure process
07:47 - during the whole digital print like how
07:50 - it is made digitally
07:53 - yes
07:55 - okay i'm getting a bunch of this phone
07:57 - is buzzing like crazy which i assume
08:00 - it's not it's somebody who's instagram
08:01 - messaging
08:03 - this phone is it going today are you
08:05 - going today hold on
08:08 - there's somebody this is a an official
08:10 - nyu phone that i think someone left
08:12 - their instagram signed in on but let me
08:14 - uh let me try to look at the skype
08:15 - because i think
08:17 - the captioner is sending me some
08:18 - messages
08:19 - let me look at the chat
08:25 - all right this is me testing uh speaking
08:27 - directly into the money
08:34 - okay
08:38 - this is perfect
08:44 - shoot that separately and then move on
08:46 - to getting cool detail uh hi my name is
08:48 - noah um and um
08:51 - so we're trying to because we're we're
08:52 - doing like a lot of live streams let's
08:54 - do it at different things hi my name is
08:57 - noah i'm a first year at itp um and my
08:59 - project is sort of about uh video
09:01 - collage and machine learning
09:05 - fantastic but i don't know why i just
09:06 - did this yeah
09:08 - cool all right so give us a i give you a
09:10 - demo yeah okay so basically what's going
09:11 - on here are there our live stream
09:14 - streaming cameras on the floor
09:15 - and you can play with them so what i'm
09:17 - gonna do right here is if we look at
09:18 - stream three you can see all of us
09:21 - right now and i'm gonna make our heads
09:22 - appear on our sort of body collage so by
09:25 - using this controller
09:29 - come on
09:32 - oh right it's it's stream three i
09:33 - changed it to stream one so there we go
09:36 - in one second and there we go so now
09:38 - it's all of our heads as part of this so
09:40 - i can make our bodies show up too
09:42 - um stream three
09:44 - so in a second you'll see a big orange
09:46 - blob hopefully for shiffman's body
09:49 - i wore this orange sweater specifically
09:52 - for this demo
09:54 - let's see if i can get it to swap there
09:55 - we go
09:56 - so it allows you to play with these
09:58 - streams to sort of create a human
09:59 - collage if you know the game exquisite
10:01 - corpses
10:02 - um the colloquial version of that is the
10:04 - game that you play with drawing pictures
10:06 - that was an inspiration for this
10:10 - thank you thank you so we checked the
10:11 - blue blocks
10:14 - are you activated with your blocks
10:16 - you're having a nice like cup of tea or
10:17 - something okay coffee okay
10:20 - so tell us your name and a few sentences
10:23 - about your project so my name is demis
10:25 - and my project is basically a black
10:28 - puzzle game when you can build the
10:30 - correct sentence the animation is
10:33 - basically a hint about what is the
10:35 - sentence and you have to slide the
10:38 - blocks into the box to complete that
10:40 - sentence let's see can you show us a
10:42 - demo of it yeah so
10:58 - yeah and the tomato is bouncing
11:02 - and then you pass to the next sentence
11:04 - you have to use the green box in this
11:06 - case
11:07 - so you can remove this one
11:13 - this is basically like a learning tool
11:16 - for kids the
11:20 - cara
11:23 - no say that try again
11:25 - so
11:40 - thank you
11:43 - okay
11:44 - like my goals okay great great my goal
11:47 - is to like uh do as many projects as
11:49 - possible so with this previous years we
11:50 - would so i'm kind of we're just doing
11:52 - the rapid fire
11:54 - okay
11:55 - um tell us your name in a few sentences
11:57 - about your project and then we'll kind
11:58 - of go and look at some of the uh
12:00 - specific parts because there's so many
12:01 - yeah um hi i'm winnie um and so these
12:04 - are
12:05 - from my data class i'm from hong kong so
12:08 - i did a lot of projects about the
12:09 - protests and specifically focusing on
12:11 - the narratives um i'm really interested
12:13 - in non-traditional um approaches to
12:16 - protests um and the focus of narrative
12:18 - is because i feel like our ability to
12:20 - craft our own narrative is something
12:22 - that's really powerful and healing um so
12:24 - these are all different projects about
12:26 - um narratives and distances
12:29 - um
12:30 - yeah sorry um no so this two projects
12:33 - are about police and um protesters uh
12:37 - and so i have these youtube videos that
12:39 - i scripted transcript um from and i did
12:42 - these generative texts uh and also with
12:45 - the most common words i made these
12:48 - fridge magnets that people could
12:50 - interact with
12:51 - and then this piece here is all the
12:54 - protest information i have consumed from
12:57 - september up until now
12:59 - so as you hover you could see the
13:01 - articles
13:02 - and the brighter the box is the more
13:05 - articles i have read
13:07 - in that hour of the day and then the
13:09 - last one
13:11 - there is more about media rendering
13:14 - because a lot of times when we read the
13:16 - same information
13:17 - we could have very different
13:19 - interpretations so i was curious to see
13:21 - if i could create a system for us to
13:23 - even understand that um so what i did is
13:26 - that i create
13:28 - this framework where i have
13:31 - this article
13:32 - which is compiled by a number of
13:34 - pro-china and pro-hong kong media
13:37 - articles um and i asked people to select
13:40 - the three most important sentences
13:42 - and then to type
13:44 - uh words and response and also pick uh
13:48 - the headline images that they think is
13:50 - the most appropriate
13:51 - and also ask a little bit about whether
13:53 - they have been following the protests
13:55 - and after they did that they could see
13:57 - everyone's
13:58 - responses
14:01 - thank you
14:02 - okay i'm gonna just uh because i'm
14:04 - feeling very paranoid i'm gonna see if i
14:06 - can get the youtube chat going on this
14:08 - phone also i'm just gonna check speaker
14:11 - has to be closer to the mic so we're
14:12 - gonna do our best let's see we're going
14:15 - to do a little check-in maybe you're
14:16 - saying a lot of important things in the
14:18 - chat
14:19 - so i don't know how to use this phone
14:20 - youtube
14:28 - search this is a really cool project
14:31 - okay good
14:32 - i'm more looking for people saying like
14:34 - the stream's not working i can't hear
14:36 - anything
14:37 - um but the chat looks good okay
14:41 - okay great no it's all going very well
14:44 - usually the chat is just full of people
14:46 - com not not complaining complaining is
14:48 - the wrong word very nicely
14:50 - providing constructive
14:52 - critique about what the technology is
14:54 - not doing properly but i think we might
14:55 - have finally got all the right pieces
14:57 - here all right
14:59 - yeah we come in here okay
15:01 - so we're kind of doing this quick
15:04 - uh rapid fire glimpses of everybody's
15:06 - projects so they can tell us your names
15:09 - uh in a few sentences about your project
15:11 - and then we'll also go around and shoot
15:12 - some footage more closely and i can see
15:14 - that it's much longer than it was
15:15 - yesterday yes
15:17 - i'm naila davis and i'm simone salvo and
15:20 - we also have another collaborator
15:22 - elizabeth perez who's not yesterday but
15:24 - together we all may say her name which
15:26 - is an interactive portrait it's
15:28 - commemorating the life of sandra sandra
15:30 - bland commemorating and celebrating her
15:32 - life so what we did was used um these
15:36 - this process called internal
15:42 - total
15:43 - internal reflection
15:44 - and we printed this image on lucite so
15:47 - the idea is that when you walk past the
15:49 - sensor it'll detect that you're there
15:51 - and when you say her name
15:53 - sandra bland
15:56 - this will end up printing
16:02 - if it goes well
16:04 - we've been having some um
16:08 - some some small technical difficulties
16:10 - with our ultrasonic sensor so as
16:12 - everything at itp this has become a um a
16:16 - prototype more than a finished piece and
16:18 - we're really learning through this
16:19 - experience of having people see it like
16:21 - what we would do differently how we
16:23 - would change it and also seeing how it
16:25 - changes as people interact with it for
16:27 - sure like when the first roll of paper
16:30 - came down it was like okay what do we do
16:32 - now right let's just leave it so
16:35 - i want to try to say it again say
16:38 - sandra bland
16:41 - p5 is hearing you
16:50 - but i guess you guys
16:52 - come back another i know you're gonna
16:53 - have to come back it's printed this many
16:55 - times there is a delay also so sometimes
16:58 - when you say the name it'll end up
16:59 - printing
17:00 - um but we've also noticed that this
17:03 - ultrasonic sensor in communication with
17:05 - p5 causes some type of lags that we
17:08 - can't necessarily
17:09 - detect
17:16 - and sometimes you know the the medium of
17:18 - digital media shows through
17:22 - and we get that
17:25 - we'll fix it all in post
17:28 - thank you great job congratulations
17:30 - thank you for sharing thanks guys
17:41 - hello
17:42 - tell us your name and a few sentences
17:43 - about your project yeah hi my name is
17:46 - and i work this with clingy
17:51 - it's called behind a toe so you have to
17:54 - go to the back of the tube to see the
17:56 - detector project
17:59 - so what can you just give us the
18:00 - explanation first and then we'll go look
18:02 - behind you okay um so people always look
18:04 - at the front of the talk and we want
18:05 - people to actually see what is behind
18:07 - and what's the relationship between
18:09 - people who have been passed away and
18:11 - people who are alive and visiting them
18:13 - so uh the movement and also the sound of
18:16 - the people who are alive will actually
18:18 - if that's what the topes movement
18:21 - be like we want to use this to talk
18:23 - about the relationship and discuss that
18:25 - so that's it
18:56 - instagram notifications
19:24 - hello uh tell us your name and a few
19:26 - sentences about your project oh this is
19:27 - a vr project this will be hard but you
19:29 - can but there's you have excellent
19:31 - display of extra information fantastic
19:32 - it's marcel oliver yeah so it's my name
19:34 - and it's a vr project that's like based
19:37 - on compositional experimentation in vr
19:39 - unfortunately i'm not sure quite how to
19:41 - show it right you're welcome to look at
19:43 - it yourself yeah i'll come back i would
19:45 - love to see it
19:46 - um but yeah it's
19:48 - kind of a non-narrative art piece
19:53 - thank you
20:08 - so we're doing quick uh summaries of
20:10 - people's projects i'm very excited about
20:12 - this so just tell us your name
20:15 - names uh maybe stand next to each other
20:16 - if that's okay um and then we'll get you
20:18 - doing a quick explanation then we'll
20:20 - also then show people the project oh
20:21 - yeah okay i'm chanel
20:23 - i'm eating and this is our game
20:25 - authentic or not um it is a cooking game
20:28 - that teaches you how to cook traditional
20:30 - indian and chinese recipes
20:33 - and now we can just show you the
20:35 - how it works
20:37 - push the button
20:38 - and then drum rolls
20:40 - so now we are choosing chinese green
20:43 - pepper with pork
20:45 - and you can either use your hands or
20:47 - spoon to choose whatever you think
20:50 - is
20:51 - right for the dish
20:54 - and then
20:59 - keep growing
21:00 - now is the
21:06 - [Laughter]
21:13 - to get the traditional recipes and learn
21:15 - more about our project on our website
21:18 - and if you get more than 60 percent we
21:20 - are gifting some indian and chinese
21:21 - snacks yes yes
21:25 - thank you so much yeah thank you so much
21:31 - all right uh oh we got all three okay
21:35 - tell us your names
21:37 - about your product
21:38 - hold on let's let's hold it take it from
21:39 - the top it's so fast we need the
21:41 - microphones yeah i'm sure
21:44 - yeah
21:45 - and we made
21:47 - our believable news project and this is
21:49 - an installation
21:51 - and
21:53 - and about fake news yeah and
21:56 - basically you can see the news before
21:59 - you wear these glasses and if you wear
22:01 - these glasses you can see a piece of
22:04 - news and it says hong kong high court
22:06 - band black holes in public space and
22:08 - where 30 people were arrested and this
22:11 - image actually looks totally makes sense
22:13 - for this uh news that if you change to
22:16 - another glasses
22:17 - you can see a different version of this
22:19 - news
22:21 - this is our secret here yeah i can touch
22:23 - here and trigger this
22:25 - and you can see
22:27 - another piece of news happening in
22:28 - berlin also makes sense for this image
22:31 - and if you change to another glasses and
22:33 - you can see also see another group it
22:35 - says customers in shanghai fight for
22:37 - shirts and
22:39 - people will don't know which is true and
22:41 - which is fake and after they say
22:45 - sing all of the news and they could
22:47 - share this news to other person and
22:50 - this is those three are the news they
22:53 - sword and
22:54 - if i want to share like
22:56 - a high court band black clothes in
22:58 - public space and i can just share it if
23:01 - i share it and it will tell you it is a
23:04 - misinformation or the real news and yeah
23:07 - the message you just shared will appears
23:09 - on other people's screen and
23:12 - the message you just shared with other
23:13 - people will affect other people's uh
23:16 - final decision about which is real and
23:18 - which is fake so we made this project
23:21 - basically we want to let people to know
23:26 - to to question the genuineness of the
23:28 - image because many people think the
23:30 - image actually are the evidence of the
23:32 - events so and so the second step for our
23:35 - project we want people to
23:39 - know that actually their behavior is
23:41 - affecting
23:42 - other people
23:44 - they are not only the consumer of fake
23:46 - news they are also the
23:48 - enhancer of the
23:49 - fake news influences yeah
23:52 - thank you thank you thank you
23:55 - thank you i like it we're all applauded
24:02 - all right we're just going to keep going
24:03 - through all these projects all right
24:05 - tell us your name in a few seconds about
24:06 - your project my name is jason and i'm
24:08 - the creator of this project it's called
24:10 - optimize optimize is a
24:12 - tailor made mouse designed to fit
24:14 - everybody's head so
24:16 - um so this is the prototype
24:18 - uh the electronics i made all the like
24:21 - industrial design and also in the
24:23 - tronics coating and everything i start
24:25 - from here it's a dummy mouse and
24:28 - i
24:29 - model it on top with play-doh
24:32 - so it fits my hand perfectly so i did
24:34 - some photogrammetry which is powered by
24:37 - machine learning and reconstructed the
24:39 - model
24:40 - into
24:41 - a digital scan of my hand and it turned
24:45 - into a real mouse model and get 3d
24:48 - printed so it becomes
24:50 - the model you see here so it's a
24:52 - ergonomic mouse and
24:54 - because a mouse is the most dependent
24:57 - peripheral which is uh to your hand size
25:00 - and grip so this is the perfect solution
25:03 - for me and hopefully it's going to be a
25:05 - business in the future
25:06 - thank you congratulations
25:08 - okay
25:10 - oh yes let's take a look at this
25:19 - oh
25:21 - can you guys come and talk about your
25:22 - project yeah okay let's let's let's get
25:25 - you giving a quick explanation and then
25:27 - we can try to demo it and get some
25:28 - footage all right say your name first
25:30 - too you do my name
25:33 - my name is cezar khan
25:35 - and our project is called the joys of
25:37 - being a screensaver and it's an
25:39 - interactive video installation with four
25:40 - channels of video and one rotary phone
25:43 - uh the concept is that a human is stuck
25:46 - as your screen saver and you can
25:48 - interact with her by calling her on the
25:50 - rotary phone
25:51 - and by her calling you on the phone and
25:54 - it's just the back and forth between the
25:55 - real world and the digital world between
25:57 - you making the character move on the
25:59 - four screens around you and
26:01 - fur making you turn around
26:06 - all right should we try it we got
26:07 - somebody trying it already
26:16 - this is so good
26:23 - [Music]
26:43 - yeah so she's behind me
27:00 - so
27:15 - that's so cute
27:17 - so now i call back right
27:33 - what number am i dialing you can dial in
27:35 - two five seven
27:37 - okay
27:51 - oh she's here
28:13 - that's it right i did it right
28:18 - hello all right we're coming over here
28:20 - tell us your name hello and a few
28:22 - sentences about your project
28:24 - my name is hayek
28:25 - my name is tonic
28:27 - our project called artifice
28:29 - is about
28:30 - we can try to testing that human can
28:32 - live with a robot in the future and
28:34 - robot can replace human or not so our
28:37 - concept is the test that you have to
28:39 - identify who is a human and who is a
28:41 - robot it's a mother it's like a turing
28:44 - test but in a vr environment so we try
28:46 - to embrace a human connection between
28:48 - two people in vr so i would like to demo
28:51 - you
28:52 - we need one person who is going to be
28:53 - the actor and one person is going to be
28:55 - the judge i
28:56 - guess
28:58 - okay and we need we need one we need one
29:01 - more to be a judge
29:03 - so your mission is try to
29:05 - help him identify that you are human
29:08 - okay but among the experience there's a
29:11 - lot of robots
29:12 - that look like you okay and try to
29:14 - pretend to be you okay so you have to
29:16 - give them a clue that hey this is me
29:19 - okay i'm the human i'm human i'm human
29:22 - you're a robot oh i'm a robot but
29:26 - yes that's right that's right
29:28 - so
29:29 - i will set you up here okay
29:32 - and i need one person yeah to be a judge
29:35 - right
29:36 - so
29:36 - in this we combine like we are
29:38 - experienced and server client so you're
29:42 - going to be the server you're going to
29:43 - be the judge okay
29:45 - so you don't have to do anything okay
29:47 - you just observe i can do that
29:50 - and uh
29:52 - and you can identify he's a human or not
29:54 - at the end of the game usually
29:56 - take off your headset and then you come
29:59 - out and say
30:00 - is that you all right
30:12 - [Music]
30:18 - did you see anything i see it yeah
30:24 - this is the point of view that you will
30:25 - see for me
30:54 - oh they're dancing dancing yeah
31:06 - [Laughter]
31:16 - yeah i was
31:20 - okay
31:22 - so do you know
31:23 - which one is a human
31:26 - i was thinking the one on the right but
31:28 - i don't know i can't tell you so you
31:29 - think the one on the right yeah yeah
31:40 - so how do you feel that you get tricked
31:41 - by the machine
31:43 - machines are too smart man
31:47 - you help him identify yes
31:49 - yeah i didn't you know i think i if i
31:51 - had a second chance i think i might have
31:52 - more of a sense of like what some
31:54 - strategy might be i was just even going
31:56 - into the vr headsets no disadvantage
32:07 - but do you think like his movement is
32:08 - different than others than other robots
32:11 - in the center well i guess i was
32:13 - thinking about the road on the right so
32:14 - i started once i like thought it was
32:15 - that when i started focusing on that one
32:17 - more um so i kind of ignored the other
32:19 - two after a while um
32:21 - i guess i was also trying to figure out
32:22 - how that would move
32:25 - from what i've seen
32:34 - sid isn't here but this is a really fun
32:36 - a little arcade i can explain this
32:38 - project or do you want do you guys know
32:40 - about this project okay so this is
32:42 - project from sid
32:43 - who's not here maybe we can come back
32:45 - again to introduce it but it's a it's a
32:47 - small arcade um that's built with an
32:50 - arduino inside and you can select a
32:51 - whole bunch of different games it looks
32:52 - like they're
32:53 - playing tetris right now so take a look
33:04 - it's really cute
33:12 - looks like we have a professional tetris
33:13 - player here
33:16 - okay let's uh
33:18 - should we go around here
33:21 - there is
33:26 - all right hello can you give us a couple
33:28 - sentences about tell us your name in a
33:29 - couple sentences hi i'm borah uh so this
33:31 - is variations on computational
33:32 - association i'm feeding in my artwork
33:34 - and the neural network is trying to
33:36 - guess what it's saying and then recreate
33:37 - what it's saying
33:39 - uh but the premise of premise is it has
33:41 - to create something so it has to take
33:43 - liberties and combining stuff that
33:45 - hasn't seen combined before so it's sort
33:48 - of inadvertently creating some abstract
33:50 - art
33:51 - in in response to my art which is
33:53 - similar to what we do how we react to
33:55 - abstract ideas
34:08 - if
34:29 - okay
34:35 - are you using runway yes
34:40 - this probably is quite involved yes but
34:43 - can you give us a quick summary of the
34:44 - game of the project and then we'll like
34:46 - shoot some stairs but i don't know we'll
34:48 - have time to play it but pretty much
34:49 - it's just an old-fashioned board game
34:52 - uh
34:53 - i'm trying to solve the problem of our
34:55 - major games i have to deal with strategy
34:58 - and family being together
35:00 - namely
35:01 - monopoly risk and murder
35:03 - not having to deal with war
35:06 - murder or
35:08 - or bankruptcy
35:09 - so my game is called jackrabbits and you
35:12 - play with regular poker cards and
35:14 - basically what you're trying to do is
35:16 - that you're these rabbits that live in
35:18 - this kingdom and not trying to find a
35:20 - king a queen and a jack to officiate the
35:22 - wedding in this in the in the castle it
35:25 - comes with tiles so every time you play
35:28 - you create a different kingdom a
35:29 - different board and in the game what you
35:32 - do is you navigate through it trying to
35:34 - find the royal cards so in that sense
35:36 - it's like you're collecting properties
35:37 - like you would do with monopoly but
35:39 - instead of like trying to get your
35:41 - your opponent to go bankrupt you're just
35:43 - trying to
35:44 - arrange this wedding before they do
35:46 - did you make all of these pieces i made
35:49 - everything and design and everything um
35:50 - it's made out of mdf and it's laser cut
35:54 - and this is just like a sticker
35:56 - photo
35:58 - uh printed with a
36:00 - inkjet printer
36:01 - and i built the digital version of the
36:04 - board with v5
36:06 - which you can actually put together and
36:08 - rotate it i'll show you let me restart
36:11 - it
36:17 - the idea is that um
36:21 - if i still have to figure out how to get
36:23 - this into production
36:25 - maybe do a kickstarter but in the
36:27 - meantime i'll put this online and people
36:30 - will be able to play with their own
36:32 - uh poker card so if you have a deck of
36:34 - cards you don't need to wait for me to
36:36 - produce the actual board to be able to
36:39 - play john graves awesome great job i
36:42 - really want to come and play it yeah
36:44 - [Music]
36:47 - what you don't know is lachlan was our
36:49 - sound check person yesterday
36:52 - they've really rehearsed uh their
36:54 - project description not really but okay
36:56 - so tell us your name which you have
36:57 - already uh spoiler alert lachlan and uh
37:00 - a little bit a few sentences about your
37:02 - project hey so i'm lachlan i'm a
37:04 - first-year student here at ima uh and so
37:06 - i made a website called gun funded and
37:08 - it's a visualization of the gun lobby's
37:10 - funding of u.s congress
37:12 - cool do you want to like screw i mean
37:14 - people can go what's the url for the
37:15 - project it's gunfunded.com so maybe we
37:18 - can get a little footage of you
37:19 - scrolling through it but yeah
37:21 - so on the website you can enter your
37:23 - home address to find your representative
37:26 - or you can explore so here we are in
37:28 - brooklyn um and so unsurprisingly our
37:32 - representative here is not funded by gun
37:34 - rights groups those received a little
37:36 - bit of money from net control groups
37:38 - but you can also
37:40 - see some of the top funded congress
37:41 - people or you can explore by state um
37:44 - and so
37:45 - like where i'm from in pennsylvania um
37:47 - you can you can see the total um and how
37:51 - the funding is disproportionately um
37:53 - goes to uh republican men in congress
37:57 - and so you can go to anyone's profile
37:59 - you can share these
38:01 - you can see lists of top senators
38:02 - representatives
38:04 - and
38:06 - more and there's also a view of the pacs
38:09 - that give money
38:10 - so you can see
38:12 - that um like in 2018 there was 22
38:14 - million given to congress but in 2016 it
38:17 - was 58 million and so basically every
38:20 - year up until um just recently the
38:23 - graphs looked like this
38:25 - um because congress has received about
38:27 - 40 million dollars from gun rights
38:29 - groups
38:30 - and about 5 million from gun control
38:32 - groups and so you can also click to
38:34 - filter the list and see like how much
38:35 - money the nra specifically is given
38:37 - every year um or or any other group so
38:40 - that's gun funded and it's gunfunded.com
38:43 - thank you
38:45 - thanks
38:49 - hello
38:50 - will you
38:51 - tell us your name in a few sentences
38:52 - about your project yes my name is
38:54 - veronica alfaro this is a
38:57 - this is a breathing exercise
38:59 - so the way that it works is
39:02 - you
39:04 - squeeze the ball and you inhale at the
39:05 - same time that you
39:07 - release the ball and you exhale you're
39:08 - supposed to follow the pattern that this
39:11 - hexagon is giving you and there is also
39:13 - some sound coming out of the
39:15 - headphones that is also guiding your
39:17 - breathing so the idea is that people can
39:20 - have some sensory input at the same time
39:22 - some visual input to
39:24 - calm and relax and this is targeted for
39:27 - people with anxiety and who are
39:29 - suffering from a lot of anxiety before
39:33 - wonderful job i can attest i tried this
39:35 - yesterday and it really helped me calm
39:37 - down in a wonderful way

41:00 - i could take over if you want i've got
41:01 - lots of negative things to say oh god
41:04 - no about myself
41:16 - the key to happiness is in accepting
41:18 - your thoughts all of them even the bad
41:20 - ones accept your thoughts don't become
41:22 - them understand for instance that having
41:24 - a sad thought
41:25 - even having a continuous succession of
41:27 - sabbath is not this is so nice
41:30 - so it says it took you 12.7 seconds to
41:32 - say something negative
41:34 - 4.5 seconds to say something positive
41:37 - racing cards by emily's hour thank you
41:40 - yeah of course this is really nice

42:16 - frames with which to represent
42:18 - okay
42:20 - there was a little boy trying this
42:21 - yesterday
42:24 - so i have two frames
42:39 - and as more people come and add frames
42:42 - then you can read more and more of the
42:44 - story
42:45 - and try to understand
42:47 - based on their gifts and how people
42:49 - chose to represent the words and
42:51 - if you've tried to understand then you
42:53 - compare it to the original story
42:59 - it's really fun i wouldn't have thought
43:00 - you would get so much out of just two
43:02 - frames yeah but it's it's amazing it's

47:03 - spacecraft that is okay
47:05 - the instructions are in your console
47:07 - because you need to do them before the
47:09 - countdown is over otherwise you will
47:11 - damage the ship
47:12 - too much damage and we will all die did
47:15 - you get that good starting preparation
47:18 - sequence in five four three two one
47:21 - new instructions you have 50 seconds
47:50 - new instructions you have 45 seconds
47:58 - [Music]
48:00 - uncovered
48:18 - cool foreign right all right
48:21 - still 10 live instructions you have 40
48:24 - seconds no that's the bottom you're off
48:26 - to a great start the engine is
48:29 - [Music]
48:40 - [Music]
48:49 - [Music]
49:01 - new rios
49:02 - you have 27 seconds
49:05 - the motors are turning faster
49:10 - [Music]
49:23 - new instructions you have 24 seconds
49:26 - slide over the top
49:28 - slide
49:32 - uh
49:36 - [Music]
49:55 - is
50:12 - [Music]
50:36 - you can accomplish anything
50:47 - up
51:00 - [Music]
51:06 - you have eight seconds
51:12 - [Music]
51:19 - [Applause]
51:33 - thank you for praying
51:49 - tell us your name in a few seconds sure
51:50 - hi i'm adrian bautista a second year
51:53 - graduate student at itv
51:55 - um i built this project called public
51:56 - message which is meant to explore you
51:59 - know how do physical locations and
52:00 - augmented reality
52:02 - shape public discussions um so basically
52:05 - i mean if you want to do a quick demo
52:06 - yeah let's tell us tell us the spiel and
52:08 - then because it's sort of sure
52:10 - the audio will be lost i mean i guess
52:11 - it's becoming more common now for air
52:13 - content to appear in public spaces from
52:15 - like pokemon go
52:16 - to the jeff kuhn snapchat collaboration
52:19 - but then the question of like who
52:22 - kind of controls that space
52:24 - like
52:24 - is it the platform or is it the people
52:27 - who create the content or is the people
52:29 - who actually own the space or if it's a
52:30 - public space is it the government um
52:33 - so just kind of want to kick out that
52:34 - conversation as ar becomes more and more
52:36 - popular
52:37 - more prevalent um so what i did was i
52:40 - built
52:41 - a little app where
52:43 - i'm just a simple qr sticker you just
52:46 - any smartphone that can read a qr
52:51 - it'll open up a web ar experience so
52:53 - there's no app you have to download or
52:54 - anything
52:55 - it gives you a little pointer about how
52:57 - to set it up
52:58 - start it and when you point it
53:01 - and so there's a little
53:03 - prompt and then you could always reply
53:06 - to say like i wouldn't i wouldn't like
53:08 - sponsor content on my door
53:26 - the content there so people can kind of
53:28 - discuss in a physical space
53:30 - that's there but not really there
53:33 - so yeah fantastic great job thank you
53:49 - uh
53:50 - tell us your name and a couple sentences
53:52 - about your project i'm jenny i'm a
53:54 - second year icp student my project is an
53:57 - ar audio visual healing system that take
54:00 - you through my love story in new york
54:02 - city
54:02 - and most of the stories happen in
54:04 - washington square park so the experience
54:07 - is actually mapped in washington square
54:09 - park and how the real experience is that
54:11 - you follow this transparent tube and it
54:14 - will lead you to a location where
54:16 - there's this big reveal of like
54:17 - self-love it's kind of like a metaphor
54:20 - of how when people are in relationship
54:22 - there's like tunnel vision they only see
54:24 - one point and it's like you know when
54:26 - people are doing are there focusing on
54:28 - their phone and it looks ridiculous for
54:30 - people from the outside and hopefully
54:33 - hopefully in the end with the big reveal
54:34 - people can take in the beauty of the
54:36 - world and we focus on themselves that's
54:38 - why it's self-love yeah
54:40 - would you like to try
54:42 - yeah um yes so the audio only comes
54:45 - through the headphones yeah yes
54:48 - so
54:49 - because it's mapped to washington square
54:50 - park that's why you can only experience
54:52 - the very last bit of of the experience
54:55 - like the revealing part and it's not
54:57 - mapped here so you have to be careful
54:59 - not to bump into people
55:02 - if you wanna try okay let's try for a
55:04 - couple minutes
55:16 - so do you see the transparency
55:19 - and how you play the audio is by putting
55:21 - a tube in the middle of the screen
55:23 - to make it solid
55:25 - that's the only time when the audio will
55:26 - play
55:27 - and then this is the the revealing part
55:45 - but yeah you can see where the tube is
56:01 - it's a very large scale so you can walk
56:03 - like way
56:12 - is it a circle
56:14 - it was supposed to be in the park so it
56:16 - would be a walk but just not
56:34 - so that's why i have the documentation
56:36 - video on to tell you what the real
56:38 - experience supposed to be like
56:41 - [Music]
56:47 - okay
56:49 - thank you let's come over here
56:51 - uh tell us your names and a couple
56:53 - sentences about your project i'm maya
56:55 - and i'm kara
56:57 - i our project is a data visualization
57:00 - that uses augmented reality to um
57:03 - look at housing unaffordability in the
57:05 - lower east side in manhattan um so why
57:08 - do you want to show your home yeah
57:10 - so um basically if you pick up this ipad
57:14 - um and you look at the map
57:16 - side um it's gonna show you a hundred
57:18 - people then if you click on this little
57:19 - icon in the corner it will bring up some
57:21 - facts so first it's gonna show you the
57:23 - median
57:24 - um side then it's going to show you what
57:24 - apartment rent
57:28 - the immediate
57:30 - income is in that same area and there's
57:32 - a pretty stark contrast of
57:34 - those two numbers
57:35 - and then it shows you how that actually
57:37 - affects people's ability to live in that
57:38 - area
57:39 - so it talks about this thing called the
57:41 - 40 times rule and the 40 times rule
57:43 - states that you must make 40 times a
57:45 - monthly rent in income per year in order
57:47 - to be allowed to rent so this is
57:48 - something that happens when you're
57:49 - applying for a new place
57:51 - so if maya goes ahead and closes it
57:55 - but we wanted to show the disparity of
57:56 - the people that are living in this area
57:58 - so slowly they start to fade away and
58:00 - this is to show you that of the
58:02 - population of 158 000 in the lower east
58:04 - side truly only eight percent of them
58:07 - would be able to live there according to
58:08 - the 40 times rule
58:10 - and so that's what remains
58:14 - thank you
58:16 - all right let's go over to
58:20 - all right hello there will you tell us
58:22 - your name and a couple sentences about
58:24 - your project and then you can demo it as
58:25 - well okay i'm eva i'm a second year at
58:27 - itv um and so i made a chrome extension
58:31 - that goes over a browsing page and
58:33 - highlights the co2 emissions that are
58:35 - produced during um
58:37 - during internet use internet browsing so
58:40 - i can show you if you want
58:42 - basically
58:43 - this chrome extension adds these bubbles
58:45 - to the tops of
58:47 - any webpage and when when you load a web
58:49 - page a new bubble appears and the size
58:51 - of the bubble estimates the grams of co2
58:54 - that's produced um during that paid load
58:57 - um and then it sort of it calculates the
59:00 - grams of co2 produced during this
59:02 - browsing session and sort of tries to
59:04 - estimate the standard the
59:07 - miles that you could drive emitting that
59:09 - same amount of co2
59:10 - in a standard car
59:12 - uh so all these numbers are very much
59:14 - estimates because it's something that's
59:16 - very hard to quantify but
59:18 - this was
59:19 - more sort of to show people outside of
59:21 - the itp community that don't really know
59:23 - about this to make them realize that the
59:25 - internet has physical consequences
59:28 - so yeah
59:29 - is it available in the chrome store not
59:32 - at the moment because i want to fix some
59:33 - of the numbers but um
59:36 - yes at some point and then i also just
59:38 - for fun um
59:40 - looked at the
59:41 - uh how many sort of api calls are made
59:44 - for
59:45 - twitter and like every second and then i
59:48 - also mapped my own
59:50 - um
59:51 - browsing throughout the week and just to
59:53 - see how many grams of co2 using my
59:55 - memories to see
59:57 - how much i'm producing
60:04 - how are you doing there ellen does your
60:05 - arm need to break maybe yeah because we
60:07 - could do some switching we could switch
60:09 - a room
60:11 - [Music]
60:24 - might recognize the song
60:33 - i don't know if this made it in on
60:35 - purpose or by accident
60:37 - it's still not sure it's a
60:38 - [Music]
60:41 - first coincidence i think of that i can
60:43 - download the patches
60:44 - okay there you go all right sorry to
60:46 - lead with that maybe all of you who
60:48 - worked on this could you gather in one
60:50 - spot
60:52 - and then um just tell us your name and a
60:54 - few sentences about your project
60:56 - okay my name is roy yeah
60:58 - i'm karen
61:01 - so this product came from that we found
61:03 - the electronics are so fascinating
61:05 - so we want to change them into other
61:08 - playful machines
61:09 - and we found all these things in the u.s
61:12 - u.s store like we bought the old
61:14 - friendly and the old tables and the old
61:17 - turntable
61:18 - and then we made this fan into a record
61:21 - player and that telephone into a rocket
61:24 - mode game and that turned over into a
61:26 - bubble machine actually it's a happiness
61:29 - generator machine
61:31 - great should we try each of them one at
61:33 - a time yeah sure yeah
61:35 - so this one is it mocks up the
61:39 - experience of playing a vinyl player and
61:41 - turns it on
61:43 - and then
61:44 - this is for changing the speed of the
61:46 - music
61:52 - [Music]
61:58 - okay
61:59 - [Music]
62:06 - uh okay then this is the workable game
62:09 - if you press this button
62:11 - the game will start and you can use the
62:14 - receptor to watch them anybody want to
62:16 - try
62:18 - like this
62:21 - [Music]
62:28 - did i break it
62:31 - [Music]
62:34 - [Applause]
62:35 - [Music]
62:37 - okay
62:43 - [Music]
63:06 - and then
63:17 - oh you are shooting the secrets
63:22 - [Music]
63:38 - cool
63:42 - hold on
63:51 - okay so tell us your name before you put
63:53 - it on or tell us your name in a few
63:54 - seconds about your project okay yeah so
63:56 - where should i be looking are you
63:58 - looking wherever you want okay but you
63:59 - can look here um i'm andrea and so my
64:02 - project's a vr project um and it uses vr
64:05 - to tell a poetic experience about sorry
64:08 - about
64:09 - kind of exploring flashbacks and what it
64:11 - means to have control over our own
64:13 - experiences and memory yeah
64:15 - wonderful does anyone want to try it off
64:18 - yeah yeah of course you've done videos
64:22 - so you can adjust the headset
64:24 - and the interaction's super easy
64:26 - um you can just press
64:30 - take your time
64:33 - let me know if you need help
64:36 - i think i'm good okay
64:38 - yeah so super easy it's just a mouse
64:41 - press here i'm gonna put it in your hand
64:42 - okay this
64:47 - is you're gonna want to go towards the
64:50 - end
64:51 - but as you go on maybe you're not going
64:53 - to want them
65:17 - it's weird that you guys can see what
65:18 - i'm doing
65:42 - oh
65:58 - oh there's more okay cool all right
66:06 - um so that man that you see is supposed
66:07 - to represent trauma so the first time
66:09 - you go through this experience it's like
66:11 - going and walking around and you make
66:13 - something horrific happen um and now
66:15 - this part is supposed to represent how
66:17 - memory will kind of try to understand
66:20 - that so the memory if you've ever
66:22 - unfortunately experienced something like
66:23 - that
66:24 - you might replay that memory in your
66:26 - head over and over again um and if he
66:28 - ever chooses to stop he can stop time
66:31 - and stop everyone from moving but he can
66:33 - never prevent what's gonna happen and so
66:35 - he is like looping this memory and it's
66:37 - i just thought vr was a really cool way
66:39 - to describe such a
66:42 - specific experience with our minds and
66:44 - allow people to become immersed and also
66:46 - think a lot about that experience in a
66:47 - different way yeah wonderful thank you
66:50 - great job
66:53 - i'm just trying
66:56 - to keep going
66:58 - quite
67:02 - [Music]
67:27 - um so my name is eric
67:29 - i had this project it's called bouncing
67:31 - ball karaoke
67:32 - and you basically have this ball
67:34 - and like every time it bounces it goes
67:36 - like one word further
67:39 - i can show it
67:40 - i
67:54 - lyrics and that's a pretty long intro 30
67:57 - seconds
68:09 - and like um time you hit the words you
68:11 - get like one point uh so
68:14 - i would say like seven more seconds
68:20 - all right
68:33 - okay
68:39 - [Music]
68:42 - so i feel the battery kind of dies
68:45 - [Music]
68:48 - but basically yeah every time it bounces
68:49 - it goes like one more further um
68:52 - and i can kind of
68:54 - maybe show it like without you know
68:57 - yeah so i guess that's it
69:00 - it is
69:01 - still your favorite song
69:03 - uh no i feel this is a song that kind of
69:05 - everyone knows
69:07 - so but not everyone seems to know it
69:09 - actually like but i think like 90 of the
69:12 - people here know it so it's
69:14 - yeah it's it's a fun song and it's also
69:16 - like really difficult to sing it in like
69:17 - a karaoke bar but like i'm trying to
69:19 - make like everyone able to actually sing
69:21 - it by while hearing the voice the actual
69:23 - singer and trying to hit it on like the
69:25 - right rhythm
69:27 - um
69:27 - yeah and i feel better that gets showed
69:29 - like working i have to change the
69:31 - battery which takes a while
69:35 - you changed the ball right yeah so
69:38 - basically it was like a rubber band
69:40 - yeah yeah it was oh yeah you're so easy
69:42 - for you to replace the bathroom yeah it
69:45 - is it is and it was very close up like a
69:47 - working prototype with like fully uh
69:49 - rubber
69:51 - but yeah unfortunately it's just this
69:53 - um well yeah all right thank you so much
69:56 - thank you
69:58 - jake
69:59 - jake
70:03 - uh
70:03 - hi so can you tell us your name and a
70:05 - little bit about your project sure i'm
70:08 - jake sherwood uh my project is called
70:10 - climatescape it's a
70:12 - kinetic art installation to raise
70:14 - awareness for climate change and the
70:15 - human effect on the climate it's
70:17 - representing four future potential
70:20 - climate change scenarios going from best
70:22 - case to worst case so as you progress
70:23 - through the installation it gets more
70:25 - and more chaotic
70:27 - cool
70:28 - so do you want to demonstrate it
70:32 - this is kind of producing more tranquil
70:36 - uh
70:37 - softer sound and then as you get through
70:39 - it gets more chaotic and becomes scary
70:41 - at the end
71:17 - can you talk a little bit about what the
71:18 - rcp
71:20 - values are uh sure so
71:25 - the rcp stands for representative
71:27 - concentration pathways it's actually a
71:29 - data modeling set that the the
71:31 - inter-governmental panel on climate
71:33 - change is opted for scientists around
71:35 - the world to be able to have a baseline
71:37 - for modeling specific climate change
71:39 - data points but it has these four
71:41 - various scenarios which allowed me to
71:43 - kind of paint a picture of best case the
71:45 - worst case for what will happen in the
71:47 - climate if we do everything to kind of
71:48 - correct the problems that we have or if
71:50 - we do nothing and all kind of
71:55 - cool all right thanks very much
72:14 - we have to be very close because of this
72:16 - okay so where uh can you tell us your
72:18 - name and a little bit about your project
72:20 - yes uh should i see the camera yes okay
72:23 - hi um my name is jacob i work with
72:26 - chiwen she's not here right now so
72:30 - our project is called around us
72:33 - it's about
72:34 - something that around us also around the
72:36 - earth
72:37 - so you can see here
72:40 - so when you wake up you always check the
72:42 - weather or when you want to go new place
72:45 - but you don't know where it is you have
72:47 - to use the map
72:49 - like google maps or atom maps but all
72:52 - those technologies are based on the
72:53 - satellites but we never think about that
72:55 - so we want to make some awareness
72:57 - through this project so they're there
73:00 - so we use open source data called the
73:03 - union of
73:04 - concerned scientists
73:06 - based on these data we made
73:08 - three visualization
73:10 - so first one is the
73:13 - timeline shows the
73:15 - from 974 to 2019 how many satellite
73:19 - launches
73:21 - based on these four categories severe
73:23 - government
73:24 - and commercial and military and you can
73:26 - see there's some question marks in here
73:28 - because this open source data is chosen
73:30 - by them so we actually don't know how
73:32 - many satellites launched during this so
73:35 - we pick some random numbers from this
73:37 - data and
73:39 - we want to show the so there's something
73:41 - more
73:42 - beyond this data
73:44 - and also based on this data there's a
73:46 - called world map visualization
73:49 - it shows uh how many satellites uh own
73:53 - each country each countries
73:55 - oh and how many satellites so obviously
73:57 - united states lead this industry
74:00 - so there's some lagging in my computer
74:02 - but at final
74:04 - united states has like more than 900
74:06 - satellites
74:08 - and the final one is called the
74:11 - satellite showing the
74:15 - what kind of satellites around earth
74:18 - so if when you hover the mouse to the
74:21 - satellite you can see the
74:23 - detail of satellite images and lifespan
74:26 - operators who owned these satellites and
74:28 - also we printed out this
74:30 - to as a some kind of trading card like
74:34 - mba or mlb
74:35 - like we don't wanna
74:37 - make this too serious we just wanna
74:41 - make people more like just fun
74:43 - and a little bit of awareness about
74:45 - they're there like
74:46 - something around us
74:48 - yes that's all great job thank you thank
74:50 - you
75:09 - this way
75:12 - [Music]
75:31 - hello my name is matt ross i'm a second
75:33 - year at itp and i'm here to to talk to
75:36 - you about your
75:38 - relationship with your data daniel
75:40 - do you think you have a problem with
75:42 - data hoarding
75:43 - yes do you just every day wake up
75:46 - generate google documents spreadsheets
75:48 - pdfs and even powerpoints that are just
75:52 - living and sitting in your cloud
75:53 - services
75:54 - yes so what i have here today is a
75:57 - simple outlet but it's not just a simple
75:59 - outlet this outlet is connected directly
76:02 - to the servers at google and what it
76:04 - does is it looks for any documents that
76:06 - you haven't even looked at in over two
76:08 - years so let's say you gave a
76:10 - presentation just two and a half years
76:12 - ago
76:13 - is that really something that you need
76:14 - in your life is this something that's
76:16 - really sparking joy
76:17 - this project is sort of my my first step
76:21 - in trying to have a better relationship
76:23 - with my data and hopefully all of our
76:25 - data and so what you can do here today
76:27 - is one of two things you can take the
76:29 - extreme route authenticate pull the plug
76:32 - and delete everything that's older than
76:34 - two years here is a video of me doing
76:37 - exactly that
76:38 - and you can say i have a lot of useless
76:40 - stuff here
76:41 - um that i haven't looked at
76:43 - but that's a little bit extreme so i
76:46 - have made an alteration to this to kind
76:48 - of let us take the first step
76:51 - into a more healthy relationship with
76:52 - our data so what you can do today is
76:56 - log in
76:57 - and it will find just one single file
77:01 - and it'll show you what that file is and
77:03 - if you're ready you can pull the plug
77:05 - and it'll delete just that single file
77:08 - and maybe just let you take a step
77:10 - towards having data in your life that
77:11 - really makes you feel good and that it's
77:13 - important to you
77:14 - would you maybe want to uh i would but
77:16 - i'm going to have to two factor in my
77:18 - phone's over here yeah yeah we might
77:21 - need it
77:22 - you know what uh just for this for the
77:23 - sake of speed i can do it myself and
77:25 - i'll delete a one of my own files live
77:28 - in live stream so i'll show you how it
77:30 - works so obviously a big a big issue is
77:33 - privacy and keeping things safe so this
77:36 - all the code is open source and you can
77:38 - see how everything is working all the
77:39 - credentials are only stored just for
77:41 - this the sole
77:43 - time of the experience and
77:45 - um all the browsers are in incognito
77:47 - windows no sessions or anything get
77:49 - saved so you start it up
77:51 - you have a nice ascii art
77:53 - you have a blank page log in
77:57 - [Music]
77:57 - [Applause]
78:06 - oh there we go
78:08 - all right don't don't worry about that
78:10 - it's a friendly suggestion
78:13 - so here are these
78:14 - these this is just the amount of things
78:16 - that any google chrome extension would
78:18 - ask of you
78:20 - allow
78:21 - okay
78:22 - so now the script is activating
78:25 - and it's see it's retrieving all
78:27 - documents from a year and a half ago
78:29 - and i have 10 total files that i haven't
78:32 - looked at in over 18 months
78:34 - and
78:35 - this is a file called life retro
78:38 - which
78:39 - i think has some life goals from a few
78:41 - years ago
78:42 - you know what i'm here at itp things
78:45 - going well let me uh let me get rid of
78:47 - this
78:48 - so
78:49 - here's this plug
78:50 - and when i pull this i'll have six
78:53 - seconds to change my mind
78:56 - see it's going gold
79:02 - you can still change it
79:04 - i think
79:05 - deletion of one file
79:08 - and
79:12 - and that's the whole process
79:13 - yeah i wanna i've i this is giving me a
79:16 - lot of anxiety yeah i feel like i need
79:19 - to like
79:20 - fully dive into this at some point
79:21 - totally
79:22 - and uh you know it's we should
79:24 - definitely talk but we have we have
79:26 - another uh
79:27 - we have i have another project here that
79:29 - i've worked on with the lovely diamond
79:30 - alkas which is a lot less invasive oh
79:32 - what a nice segue yes oh let's come over
79:34 - here welcome to our partnership here
79:37 - you've introduced yourself and now you
79:39 - can introduce yourself
79:41 - and uh tell us a few words about your
79:42 - project sure i'm donna i'm a second here
79:45 - uh here at itp and i've worked together
79:47 - with matt we developed a new team called
79:50 - url data
79:52 - where obviously you can see healthy data
79:54 - starts here
79:56 - and we really wanted to raise awareness
79:58 - of the browser hygiene and the fact that
80:00 - we are constantly
80:03 - keeping our bodies clean and whenever we
80:05 - leave the public space we hand sanitize
80:07 - our hands but our phone is no less
80:10 - public than the train and our browser is
80:13 - no less public than the train or any
80:16 - place that we're visiting so we want to
80:18 - show you uh something that we've
80:19 - developed in the past few weeks
80:22 - i'm going to take my phone
80:24 - here
80:26 - and
80:26 - i'm going to scan this qr code
80:30 - it's going to send me to a safari
80:31 - webpage
80:32 - um nothing too fancy about it it's just
80:34 - the p5 sketch asking me insert your
80:37 - phone into the container now
80:39 - i'm going to uh
80:41 - turn on our machine
80:44 - and put this lovely little phone in here

80:53 - history so i'm gonna come here to this
80:55 - corel lovely perel and i'm gonna
80:58 - use it and if you would take a look here
81:01 - my browsing history has been cleared
81:05 - and that's it we really encourage you
81:07 - all to think about doing that every time
81:09 - that you use a hand sanitizer now do you
81:11 - wanna add something about this yeah
81:13 - again this is just the first step to
81:15 - having a cleaner more healthy lifestyle
81:18 - and just like healthy hands start here
81:19 - with bureau healthy data starts here
81:22 - with our machine
81:24 - thank you i feel like this needs to
81:26 - permanently live like on the floor next
81:28 - to the actual purell we also think we're
81:30 - gonna talk with it okay so you need an
81:33 - advocate for that yeah sign me up i'll
81:35 - sign the petition

83:03 - of explores yayoi kusama's
83:07 - she has a lot of installations that are
83:08 - based off of infinity so i wanted to
83:11 - kind of play with that concept in
83:12 - virtual reality which is a truly
83:14 - infinite space so we made a few
83:16 - different rooms that you can just
83:18 - explore endlessly and you can just get
83:21 - out whenever you want
83:23 - thank you for sharing
83:35 - all right can you tell us your name

83:46 - called the shape of evil and it's a
83:49 - detective horror game
83:51 - uh yeah
83:53 - so do we need any content warning or
83:57 - no it's okay i think we're fine this is
83:59 - a horror game if anybody is uh
84:01 - concerned maybe skip ahead one minute
84:07 - can you play somebody for us okay
84:10 - okay
84:12 - like you can see i'm controlling an
84:14 - agent now
84:15 - yeah
84:16 - and i'm investigating the accident here
84:19 - yeah i can find a dead woman here
84:22 - oh and i saw the
84:24 - information about this dead woman
84:27 - and while i'm present here queue against

84:33 - thank you so much okay
84:35 - thank you
84:36 - thank you
84:37 - okay
84:37 - now we're ready over here
84:40 - [Music]
84:43 - all right can you do a quick
84:44 - introduction yourself first sure
84:46 - my name is nikhil kumar i'm a first year
84:49 - student here at itv
84:52 - the piece is a sound piece
84:56 - that is exploring a restless mind one
84:59 - thought at a time
85:00 - so when my mom starts uh
85:03 - she'll hear nothing initially but
85:06 - uh after removing each of these pieces
85:08 - and burying it in the dirt she'll start
85:10 - to hear more and more but she won't hear
85:13 - the entire musical composition until
85:14 - everything
85:16 - is removed
85:18 - and i'll just leave it at that i'm
85:19 - curious great okay
85:23 - okay left right
85:25 - just take a seat take your time
85:28 - and remove these one at a time and bury
85:31 - them here
85:32 - and that's it
85:40 - up
85:48 - [Music]
86:02 - [Music]
86:12 - well
86:45 - i think with 15 of them you basically
86:47 - never have anybody experience it the
86:49 - same way
86:50 - so they're they're hearing little bits
86:52 - and pieces of the entire composition
86:54 - as they remove things but
86:56 - now that she's removed everything
86:59 - she's going to hear the the full musical
87:01 - composition so it'll just
87:02 - run and eventually loop so people will
87:06 - ultimately get to the same experience
87:07 - but
87:08 - after taking everything out thank you
87:10 - thanks cool thanks
87:12 - right here
87:15 - tell us your name and a couple sentences
87:16 - about your project oh hi i'm rebecca and
87:19 - this is our like computer media
87:22 - final so this is kind of like a
87:24 - collective data visualization that
87:27 - visualizes your harvest as clocks
87:30 - the metaphor behind is that your clock
87:32 - is ticking so it's just like you're live
87:35 - and it's like more confidently looping
87:37 - and just it cracks and clocks and fades
87:39 - away so we want you just use your
87:41 - process like your heartbeat to
87:44 - create a unique part for you so let me
87:46 - show you
87:48 - what experience
87:52 - so gently put your finger tip on there
87:55 - so
87:56 - it will detect your harvest
88:01 - uh
88:41 - jump to the clock town so here you can
88:43 - see your
88:44 - unicorn
88:48 - there will be a unique plotting ticking
88:50 - sound for you
88:52 - and then you put your name here like my
88:54 - name is
89:16 - [Music]
89:18 - you will hear all kinds of
89:22 -  so it'd be very beautiful to
89:25 - hear all kinds of
89:26 - like other people's lives like
89:30 - and
89:31 - we're very inspired by the clock
89:33 - installation part
89:35 - made by humans since 1920 98
89:39 - and this is the thing
89:41 - thank you very much
89:49 - okay can we uh can you tell us your name
89:52 - and a few sentences about your project
89:53 - all right my name is ben mall i'm a
89:55 - first year ite student and uh i created
89:58 - a lighting designer stage
90:00 - assistant tool so you can test out your
90:03 - vision for a show before you
90:07 - so
90:08 - we've got a couple sliders on the screen
90:10 - so you can change
90:11 - let's say we want to make it a little
90:12 - more blue so you can change the
90:15 - amount of red here and it gets a little
90:16 - more purple
90:21 - and then we can move this light back and
90:22 - forth and change the shadows
90:24 - on the screen here
90:27 - yeah so you can move the shadows back
90:29 - and forth and uh the idea is that you'll
90:31 - be able to move
90:32 - both lights
90:36 - do you have a background as a lighting
90:38 - designer yeah i did some uh stage
90:39 - lighting design in college uh i studied
90:42 - electrical engineering but always loved
90:43 - theater so i always wish there was a way
90:45 - to test out what i was wanting to put on
90:48 - the stage before i got there so we're
90:49 - we're no longer at 721 broadway yeah
90:51 - yeah but we should definitely reach out
90:53 - and see if anybody in the design
90:54 - department therapy i definitely will
90:57 - yeah yeah
90:58 - great job thank you so much
91:09 - hi mom my dad
91:17 - okay tell us your name in a couple
91:18 - sentences about your project oh okay so
91:20 - my name is tiani um i also go by that
91:24 - my project is about using your face to
91:26 - play a video game um this game is called
91:29 - fake your smile and basically it's a
91:31 - game that forces you to smile in order
91:34 - to play the game um and then like would
91:37 - you like to try sure yeah okay so um
91:40 - it's um
91:42 - so you just use this camera to like um
91:44 - it will recognize your face and in order
91:46 - to start the game you have to do this
91:49 - gesture okay which is pop
91:52 - might be a little hard with the theme
92:04 - okay so um yeah so basically um this is
92:08 - how you play this game by doing this
92:12 - yeah and once the game starts every time
92:15 - i smile
92:17 - it will show the friendliness to the
92:18 - people who pass by
92:20 - and it takes four friendliness to
92:23 - actually make someone like you like
92:27 - oh no i missed it um but basically you
92:30 - have to and smile like which is not
92:32 - smile to
92:34 - regain the positive energy um so if i do
92:37 - this person like
92:42 - this person will become my friend now so
92:44 - that's basically how i play this game um
92:46 - and then just
92:48 - it requires the player to continue smile
92:50 - or not smile in order to play this game
92:52 - and then there's a final challenge based
92:54 - on how much smile you have
92:56 - um if you made one person like you you
92:59 - have to spoke your smile for 10 seconds
93:01 - and if you made two people like to have
93:03 - to smile for 20 seconds so basically the
93:06 - better you do at the beginning the
93:07 - harder it is to win the game at the end
93:09 - and now my challenge
93:11 - if
93:12 - i have to keep my smile otherwise the
93:15 - circle will start shaking
93:17 - and then in that case i will lose the
93:18 - game
93:22 - yay so that's basically how i win the
93:24 - game um and
93:26 - um basically um the longest for this
93:29 - game on that you have to hold your smile
93:32 - is 30 seconds
93:34 - yeah
93:36 - [Music]
93:46 - um tell us your
93:47 - introduce yourself tell us your name in
93:49 - a few sentences about your project okay
93:51 - so my name is
93:53 - look here okay
93:56 - my name is anna oh and i'm second year
93:58 - of itp and then recently i am studying a
94:01 - little bit more about the ar interfaces
94:04 - so this is one of my projects
94:07 - i'm a really love to drink wine but when
94:10 - i go to my store i'm not a wine expert
94:12 - so i'm easily lost which one i have to
94:15 - buy so me and my friends
94:18 - built this ar app which helps you your
94:21 - wine selection
94:23 - so first of all you can choose your
94:25 - pre-line preference first for example
94:28 - for me i like medium
94:31 - and i like
94:32 - vanilla and i like a little bit spicy
94:36 - taste
94:37 - and then you can scan your wine level
94:48 - yeah okay
94:51 - if you want to position later yeah
94:54 - maybe here
94:58 - okay so this mean is zero match with my
95:01 - preference
95:03 - so this is just okay
95:05 - for me this y model
95:07 - so what about this one
95:11 - this one also
95:13 - zero match with my preference so i might
95:16 - don't want to buy these two bottles so
95:18 - if
95:19 - people can find it's a happy face that
95:22 - means that wine bottle is perfectly
95:24 - matched with people's preference so yeah
95:28 - we are still developing in this area
95:47 - can you can you uh tell us your name my
95:49 - name is pablo and i made this joy
95:52 - detection mirror and it basically uses
95:55 - computer vision and ai to know what a
95:57 - smile looks like and it sees as well it
96:00 - lights up and you go through the
96:02 - infinity mirror all the way to the
96:04 - vortex so you guys want to try it
96:06 - if you get it to smile
96:08 - and light up you have the right to take
96:10 - one mnm if it doesn't light up it means
96:12 - that you don't have a soul
96:14 - so you might check that with your doctor
96:16 - um hey lit up
96:21 - i know you're smiling he's picking it
96:25 - [Music]
96:43 - thank you great job thanks guys
96:46 - do you have a placard
97:02 - oh hi i'm emily
97:04 - hey i'm billy and uh we worked on a web
97:07 - and mobile app that tries to show the
97:09 - relation between sound and color since
97:10 - they're both using frequency and the
97:12 - unit of hertz and other couple different
97:14 - pages that we can walk you through but
97:17 - then um here's a learn page
97:21 - um so the sound isn't working on this
97:24 - but what it's doing is um these are the
97:26 - color frequencies and it's showing the
97:28 - wavelengths associated with it and
97:30 - ideally it plays the pitch so on here
97:32 - you can see
97:34 - how the blue is higher than the red
97:40 - people can go to this site right now yes
97:42 - um it is
97:44 - el315
97:46 - dot itp
97:48 - [Laughter]
97:57 - maybe wait a couple hours everybody
97:59 - there you go
98:00 - you can also send some signals so
98:02 - um people can collaboratively draw and
98:05 - once again it's supposed to play the
98:06 - associated page
98:08 - but people can just like make a little
98:09 - party page beautiful with colors super
98:11 - fun and then um billy here will
98:13 - demonstrate that yeah so this is reading
98:16 - the webcam we put it on the about page
98:19 - this is uh reading the webcam values
98:21 - across
98:22 - the pixelated image
98:24 - and
98:26 - it plays different midi values based on
98:28 - those uh based on the
98:31 - the pixel data basically so we're kind
98:33 - of mapping the
98:35 - colors to different musical notes here
98:49 - [Music]
98:54 - yeah thanks
99:06 - and i go by henry i'm a
99:08 - itb first year student and this is a
99:10 - project me and rebecca
99:12 - working on for
99:13 - pecan class and it's about how
99:16 - data can process through light and it's
99:20 - about how our daily action can be
99:23 - transferred and processed through like
99:26 - stage by stage so if users press a
99:28 - button about their activities and you
99:31 - see the visualization between like stage
99:34 - by stage like for example i'm pressing
99:36 - button about how facebook can using our
99:39 - data set from like collecting to
99:42 - exchange and to sell to other
99:44 - advertisement companies and how they

103:21 - fabrications
103:24 - oh yes i want my receipts yeah
103:26 - sorry it's a lot of information
103:29 - so
103:29 - it'd be time to pray

103:34 - thank you
103:40 - hey how are you i'm good okay tell us
103:43 - your name and a couple cents okay your
103:44 - project i'm zeyel i'm a first year of
103:47 - itp this is called thirsty plant
103:50 - so thirsty fun is a millennial digital
103:53 - pond that's only been watered by my
103:55 - social media account activities
103:57 - um so the way that
103:59 - it targets the issue of like how
104:00 - teenagers always stick for likes and
104:02 - followers on the internet and this
104:04 - outlines
104:05 - this point always needs water so i can
104:07 - demonstrate it so if someone liked my
104:10 - tweet
104:12 - it goes
104:13 - the waters start changing
104:16 - and
104:17 - yeah
104:18 - it's also the collective flight
104:20 - installation that i want to
104:22 - show people how like
104:24 - this water got like
104:26 - changed or light got changed based on
104:28 - time based on different people on the
104:30 - internet everyone can contribute to this
104:32 - light source eric kind of like do this
104:34 - yeah wonderful great job thank you
104:45 - what did you guys
104:50 - all right some of you might by the way
104:52 - recognize this is psy if you're a member
104:54 - of the coding train who's coding trade
104:55 - community
104:56 - so i'll just introduce yourself and tell
104:59 - us a few seconds about your project yeah
105:01 - so hi i'm sai i'm the coding trained
105:03 - community manager also first year at itp
105:06 - so this project is called the black
105:08 - projections project and basically i
105:11 - built what i call like a portal mapping
105:13 - device
105:14 - so it's like a map that potentially
105:16 - could help you unlock a portal and it
105:18 - kind of talks about or investigates
105:20 - space
105:21 - time and how those are all connected to
105:23 - a lot of different moments that are
105:24 - happening um and you basically explore
105:27 - it with the magnet you move across the
105:29 - points and then different images are
105:32 - projected on the screen
105:34 - how are you sensing the magnet i'm using
105:36 - read switches so
105:38 - each point each little circle has like a
105:40 - sensor underneath and basically when you
105:43 - place a magnet over it that turns on or
105:45 - off
105:45 - and then each kind of point has a
105:48 - collection of images that are then
105:49 - displayed randomly on the screen
105:53 - do you want to demonstrate
105:56 - [Music]
106:04 - [Music]
106:19 - i'm
106:21 - [Music]
106:38 - [Music]
106:53 - [Music]
106:57 - thank you
107:11 - okay
107:11 - tell us your name and a few sentences
107:13 - about your project hi my name is lenny
107:16 - and my name is by michelle
107:18 - so our project is called the pale blue
107:20 - dot and inspired by a article called
107:25 - yet articles called the pale blue dot by
107:27 - carl
107:28 - uh
107:29 - so basically uh the way he described the
107:32 - earth as they published uh saying the
107:34 - earth from the different perspective
107:36 - and uh i think that article is really
107:39 - inspiring um you never think earth as
107:42 - such a small and fragile
107:44 - thing that's tangible and because it's
107:47 - under our feet that we don't really
107:48 - recognize it
107:49 - so we made a tangible
107:52 - earth like with a really
107:55 - [Music]
107:57 - with a metaphor of the heartbeat by
107:59 - using the led dimming on and off
108:03 - to address the issue of actually our
108:05 - human action even though it seems to be
108:08 - really tiny but it's doing a lot to the
108:10 - earth and so on top of the earth there's
108:13 - some lollipop and when you take away the
108:16 - lollipop the earth will start to
108:19 - actually develop so it's actually
108:21 - showing that the heartbeat
108:24 - actually is
108:25 - being as not as lively as before and
108:29 - inside the wrap of the lollipop there's
108:32 - a message telling you that it's the
108:34 - representing the natural resource of
108:36 - lollipop and um
108:39 - but
108:40 - it's actually telling you that you can
108:41 - take away the lollipop like you don't
108:43 - have to feel guilty because we need to
108:45 - use the natural resources but it will be
108:47 - great if you can contribute a little
108:49 - back to the earth so we have like a
108:51 - hidden mission in this rack that you
108:53 - have to actually squat down to find the
108:56 - white box under the table and inside the
108:59 - box there is more lollipop that you can
109:02 - decide to plant one lollipop back to the
109:05 - blue dot
109:07 - so if you plan it back
109:09 - yeah it will become lively again
109:14 - thank you so much
109:29 - okay tell us your name and a few
109:31 - sentences about your projects okay i'm
109:33 - starting tomorrow
109:34 - second year
109:36 - and i have um
109:39 - like installation
109:53 - but it can be also simulated by a very
109:55 - simple method it's like like i said
109:57 - ultimate oil so it costs you that
109:59 - speaking space
110:01 - okay so big wave goes faster quite a
110:04 - small wave goes slower
110:06 - so it's very similar to the real world
110:20 - is
110:34 - and also i have some air to
110:49 - originally from there
110:51 - and also here
110:54 - [Music]
111:01 - but people knew that
111:03 - scary so
111:05 - run away until 99.8 percent people
111:08 - survive but even
111:10 - [Music]
111:12 - yeah but here also i have some another
111:15 - thing
111:16 - yeah i i just quickly assure you
111:20 - [Music]
111:28 - [Music]
111:41 - [Music]
111:53 - can we come check out your project okay
111:55 - tell us your names and a few sentences
111:57 - about what you made
111:59 - the name of our project is wink rocks
112:01 - and women and it's about penio
112:03 - who are basically deep su divers in jojo
112:05 - island but it also includes stories from
112:08 - mothers in mainland korea
112:10 - so you can listen to different stories
112:12 - through different objects by scanning
112:14 - the
112:15 - tag over here to the side of your
112:17 - headphones
112:21 - and what were your names
112:23 - my name is sue
112:24 - i'm katy
112:28 - sure
112:35 - oh no i don't want to put anything on
112:36 - there
112:45 - just
113:01 - can you talk a little bit about what
113:02 - he's hearing
113:04 - yes so these are just various stories
113:07 - from interviews um taken
113:09 - from kenyo in jeju island so it's just
113:12 - kind of about like the henyo have like a
113:14 - very eco-friendly approach
113:17 - to deep sea diving and collecting
113:18 - shellfish they make sure that they never
113:20 - over harvest and they have just like a
113:22 - collective community
113:24 - of like making sure that yeah they never
113:26 - over harvest and they collect trash but
113:28 - um sadly this probably is the last
113:30 - generation of this profession just
113:32 - because like younger women in jeju
113:34 - island are choosing not to like pursue
113:36 - this profession which requires just
113:38 - years and years of training so we just
113:40 - kind of want to give an homage to like
113:43 - the different culture that has kind of
113:44 - developed in jojo island where it's more
113:46 - like matriarchal than
113:48 - mainland korea um
113:50 - yeah that's kind of funny
113:52 - yeah we also wanted to kind of
113:54 - uh
113:56 - tell the story of kenya side by side
113:58 - with
114:00 - the story of a mother in seoul so more
114:02 - of the traditional patriarchal society
114:06 - and living in that society
114:08 - thank you thanks
114:11 - i'm good
114:13 - yeah stronger than i realized all right
114:15 - let's see oh boy we've been going for
114:16 - two hours now yeah
114:27 - [Music]
114:29 - yeah i don't know if we're gonna be able

114:34 - for the takes okay tell us your names
114:36 - and a few sentences about your project
114:37 - my name is alvaro couture
114:40 - i'm nicole gernelling
114:41 - and our project is a object tracking
114:45 - installation that tracks objects to
114:47 - control different types of animations in
114:49 - real time
114:51 - so we have these spheres
114:53 - that
114:54 - help with all of the animations
114:56 - and
114:57 - yeah that's development
114:59 - after using the connect here to track
115:03 - the size of the spheres and the light
115:06 - the brightness of the spheres
115:08 - so we're getting a really smooth
115:09 - tracking of these
115:11 - which are being sent to the 3d particle
115:13 - system in unity
115:15 - and we're getting these real-time
115:24 - [Music]
115:30 - and they're both working today they are
115:32 - yeah
115:33 - they are
115:36 - all right
115:37 - it's time to take a nap okay
115:40 - uh tell us your name and if you sent us
115:42 - about your project hi i'm brent uh and i
115:45 - think work is for suckers um so i made
115:47 - this game about not working it's called
115:49 - stay in bed simulator the goal is to
115:50 - stay in the bed for as long as possible
115:52 - the game is controlled by the bed
116:08 - so you can watch tv in your bed
116:14 - you can also look at your phone in your
116:15 - bed
116:18 - and yeah
116:19 - that's pretty much that's pretty much
116:20 - the whole thing
116:29 - and what's the rule what's the record um
116:31 - the record i think right now is about 20
116:34 - 000 points which is roughly 15 minutes
116:36 - set by your very own alden rivendale
116:37 - jones um
116:39 - i have a feeling i could do very well

116:58 - uh tell us your name and a few sentences
117:00 - about your project okay i'm david and
117:03 - this is uh my project is about
117:05 - reflecting the website environments as a
117:08 - physical environment to create a tree
117:10 - that based on the website environment
117:12 - and makes it
117:13 - yeah and then
117:15 - generate the image that represent the
117:17 - environment that the user know that
117:20 - the website they go into are exactly
117:22 - like the physical environment affect you
117:25 - mentally and physically so yeah by
117:27 - showing a tree so
117:29 - here's the
117:31 - here's the website so you can go to on
117:33 - any website but for now we have a frozen
117:35 - tomatoes last airbender reviews and
117:38 - as you can see it's quite negative and
117:41 - it's a there's a red leaves and
117:44 - yeah and the entire background is in is
117:47 - like lightning and stuff so it's quite
117:50 - sad to see but it just shows you that
117:54 - you're going into a
117:56 - scary website right now at least a scary
117:58 - comments but yeah and if you look at the
118:02 - for example like
118:04 - articles from like box and stuff it take
118:07 - a while to load but yeah it will it'll
118:10 - create a tree based on the article it
118:12 - views it's getting the analysis and oh
118:15 - yeah so the
118:16 - the websites have a positive like a
118:20 - positive
118:22 - and the negative it's very more positive
118:24 - and it creates a field
118:26 - and it has a tree that represents all
118:28 - the
118:30 - all the words that go into the website
118:39 - [Music]
118:46 - all right tell us your name and a few
118:48 - words about your project okay uh my name
118:50 - is julia fernandez i worked on this with
118:51 - isabel rican she's in california um and
118:55 - my project is supposed to talk about the
118:57 - absurdity of our faces and how strange
118:59 - we look when our face is dissected and
119:02 - how recognizable we are
119:04 - awesome should i try it yes you should
119:06 - tried it yesterday this one is fun
119:16 - oh it has trouble with glasses and
119:18 - sometimes discriminates on a beard sorry
119:23 - but there you are
119:32 - what's funny is when i take my glasses
119:34 - off i can't see
119:36 - oh i don't actually know
119:42 - awesome
119:53 - okay can you tell us your name and a few
119:55 - sentences about it yeah i'm shinjuku and
119:58 - my partner is alvin he's not here he's
120:00 - flying on the miami beach
120:03 - must be nice yeah this is my project
120:05 - it's called evan flow
120:07 - and it is a kinetic light sculpture and
120:13 - we're doing this it's like light is
120:15 - always perceived as a static element in
120:17 - our life so we want to kind of break the
120:21 - boundaries and explore light in the more
120:24 - vivid way so
120:27 - we're using this to
120:31 - this motion kind of using this motion
120:34 - to recreate the tangible and natural
120:38 - phenomenon of app and flow
120:40 - so this is like going up and down and
120:44 - material wise we use mineral oil and
120:49 - this is hanging spotlights so it's kind
120:51 - of recreate the effects of sunlight hits
120:58 - if you
120:59 - see it from the side you may see the
121:01 - wavy motion
121:17 - hi tell us your name and a couple words
121:19 - about your project sure my name is aydah
121:21 - and this is my project
121:23 - it's noise it's an audio enhanced
121:26 - optical illusion
121:27 - the
121:28 - the visual pattern is a vortex the
121:30 - center shifts depending on where you're
121:32 - looking at it so as the viewer moves
121:35 - around in space it triggers also
121:37 - triggers the audio changes in the
121:39 - headphone that corresponds to the
121:42 - direction of the moving center of the
121:44 - vortex
121:47 - cool
121:48 - thank
121:48 - you do you want to try it
122:05 - oh this is the music one
122:42 - is
122:54 - just tell us your name and a few
122:56 - sentences about your project okay hi my
122:58 - name
122:59 - and this is my project here it's called
123:00 - auto vendor it's a vending machine and
123:03 - it's crew project with davey and lachlan
123:05 - so it is
123:07 - built
123:08 - like a fake vending machine we were
123:10 - trying to do here is to sell animations
123:12 - so the slogan for this is snacks and
123:14 - work so we thought about like on this
123:16 - floor
123:18 - aside from the snacks what else the
123:19 - students need when they're frustrated or
123:21 - hungry so do you want to give it a try
123:23 - sure
123:35 - is
123:40 - [Applause]
123:45 - so these are shot using slow motion
123:48 - screen and this is actually one of the
123:50 - earliest if you want to see
123:53 - [Music]
124:00 - recording the screen right now
124:02 - i'm sorry
124:23 - so this is actually
124:24 - like uh recorded using a stop motion and
124:27 - what we're trying to do here is some of
124:29 - the animations are like the machine eat
124:31 - the food itself so we were trying to go
124:33 - to think about the concept of
124:35 - convenience right now and try to link
124:36 - there was laziness it's like right now
124:39 - like the machine instead of it gives you
124:40 - food it eats itself but then we show
124:42 - this to everybody and they think that
124:44 - like the asmr like sound are very joyful
124:47 - and the teacher suggests that or you you
124:49 - guys should probably make just a cute
124:51 - machine as those animations and we're
124:53 - trying to make puns on that so that it
124:55 - gives you encouragement when you see the
124:56 - message that was going to say um go
124:59 - through the barricade and there are also
125:00 - some some others like i love you very
125:03 - much
125:04 - things like that so it's kind of cute

128:58 - if it works a little bit better
128:59 - everybody's a little bit out of frame
129:02 - honestly
129:17 - image
129:18 - [Music]
129:31 - good shave
129:33 - good job
129:44 - you got to watch
129:48 - all right tell us your name and a couple
129:50 - of sentences about your project uh my
129:52 - name is wenjing um my project is called
129:54 - neither square or circle it's all saying
129:57 - in chinese is saying that you cannot
129:59 - like make a circle without using ruler
130:02 - so it means you cannot
130:04 - um achieve something if you don't follow
130:06 - some rules so i want to explore that
130:09 - definition and
130:10 - the space between definition and
130:12 - ambiguity so i try to translate that
130:15 - into sound and
130:16 - visual
130:18 - so i want to translate between square
130:20 - and a circle and the
130:23 - visual of e will translate it into the
130:26 - sound wave
130:27 - so from a square wave to a circle
130:31 - more like a sine wave thing
130:34 - [Music]
130:38 - yeah so that's the basic idea
130:41 - behind this
130:48 - [Music]
130:56 - it's beautiful and you're just
130:57 - projecting uh like a rectangle moving
130:59 - back and forth by projecting a line a
131:01 - line the shape is defined by the all of
131:04 - these yeah
131:07 - [Music]
131:22 - okay we
131:36 - okay yeah so all right tell us your name
131:38 - and a few cents about the project i'm
131:40 - skylar devos this is my project i called
131:42 - it liquid relationships
131:44 - um and it's about connecting with other
131:46 - people
131:47 - yeah like how what's the best way for us
131:49 - to demonstrate this student is to
131:51 - okay and do it okay who wants to try all
131:54 - right i was here yesterday with like six
131:57 - people doing it it was crazy yeah the
131:58 - more people you have
132:00 - the more fun it is
132:02 - i i should not participate because i
132:04 - shouldn't tell you
132:11 - okay
132:22 - [Music]
132:31 - are the
132:32 - things that are aquarium pumps
132:35 - this is a fish tank i had as a kid
132:37 - really yeah
132:39 - that is wild it's beautiful does it
132:41 - matter just like a little like
132:45 - [Music]
133:04 - [Music]
133:07 - so it works with at least 10 people i
133:08 - haven't found
133:11 - that's amazing
133:13 - [Applause]
133:18 - it's very hard to show the vr project so
133:32 - all right i'm excited to see this in
133:33 - action all right tell us your names and
133:34 - just couple sentences about the project
133:36 - hi my name is ty hi my name is ashwin
133:38 - and this is our project it's a two-way
133:41 - shadow wall where you see the shadow of
133:43 - yourself as well as the shadow of the
133:44 - person behind it and when your two
133:46 - shadows overlap it creates music
133:48 - and we have created different sections
133:50 - which adds different filters into the
133:53 - sound piece so you can make play around
133:55 - the entire space and yeah just have fun
133:57 - with it
133:58 - so it's a different way of communicating
134:00 - with each other
134:01 - do you guys want to try it yeah sure
134:03 - sure
134:04 - yeah why don't you two try and i'll fail
134:06 - it's gonna hold
134:07 - do you want me to hold it
134:09 - [Music]
134:11 - if you say anything about the project
134:13 - say it into there the channel this one's
134:15 - live
134:17 - i tried your reactions
134:21 - [Music]
134:26 - [Music]
134:32 - [Music]
134:34 - there's no projections
134:50 - all right
134:51 - here we go
134:53 - only about like four and a half hours in
134:55 - all right
134:56 - no no no no but it's been two hours
134:59 - all right tell us your names and a few
135:02 - sentences about your project
135:03 - hi i'm tina i'm chris christina and this
135:07 - project is called one amongst many it's
135:09 - a physical data visualization
135:11 - representing women in computing
135:15 - fantastic yeah all right so what should
135:17 - we try you want to walk around through
135:19 - it and yeah
135:22 - as
135:23 - you uh pick up these orbs they
135:24 - illuminate to full brightness and you
135:26 - can see
135:27 - every woman that we
135:30 - chose is
135:31 - a cohort with a bunch of other women so
135:33 - we have computer scientists
135:34 - mathematicians as you pick
135:37 - an orb up and read about a certain woman
135:39 - other women in her cohort will also
135:41 - eliminate
135:43 - and as the orbs are interacted with over
135:45 - time they get incrementally brighter so
135:48 - the orbs that have been read a lot will
135:50 - sort of like increase invisibility and
135:53 - you can also see other orbs that have
135:55 - been read a little bit less
135:57 - yeah their
135:59 - placements are based chronologically on
136:01 - their years of accomplishments and
136:03 - their heights are based on their numbers
136:05 - of backlinks which identifies how famous
136:07 - they are so the least famous ones are
136:09 - lower to give the audience more
136:10 - accessibility to the information
136:13 - and yeah our whole concept is to kind of
136:16 - like uh give more visibility to these
136:19 - women and inspire young people to get
136:22 - into the field of computing because us
136:24 - as creators we felt like we didn't
136:26 - really know we still didn't know about
136:27 - these women until we did this project so
136:29 - it was a shame but it was really awesome
136:32 - and yeah we want to inspire the young
136:33 - people here can you tell us really great
136:34 - things about the board over there yeah
136:36 - sure
136:41 - um
136:42 - so
136:43 - this is a sticker board and like our
136:44 - idea is to kind of like have a piece of
136:47 - the project where the audience can leave
136:50 - a mark of their own into
136:52 - our project
136:54 - these are the four categories that are
136:57 - represented within our project and we
136:58 - want people who have seen the project to
137:00 - identify themselves within one of these
137:02 - circles whether they're computer
137:04 - scientists mathematician um
137:07 - creative or executives activists
137:09 - inventors or you know like a merge of
137:11 - different circles so yeah it's a little
137:13 - fun fun thing for them to leave behind
137:16 - thank you good job thank you
137:22 - [Music]
137:30 - uh just introduce yourself and tell us a
137:32 - couple things about your night uh i'm
137:34 - gail i'm a first year at itp
137:37 - and this is gil spurling by the way uh
137:40 - this is the interactive scroll
137:43 - um so
137:45 - it's designed to allow someone to
137:46 - interact with an ancient scroll
137:50 - physically so you can
137:53 - use these rods to scroll through
137:57 - they have a bunch of different
137:59 - ancient texts here which are in hebrew
138:04 - and then this allows you to
138:07 - translate
138:09 - as you're
138:10 - reading it if you can't
138:13 - read the hebrew language or
138:16 - um
138:18 - the text isn't legible
138:20 - this is
138:22 - what allows you to read
138:24 - you can scroll a little further
138:32 - [Music]
138:40 - so yeah this was a
138:42 - uh p-comp um
138:44 - project
138:45 - um
138:47 - sort of like a basic interaction design
138:50 - um
138:52 - it would probably work well and uh
138:55 - should i keep going no we're good thank
138:56 - you
139:00 - yeah
139:02 - wow
139:04 - this is yours right yeah yeah give us uh
139:06 - tell us tell us your name and a few
139:08 - sentences about your project hi i'm nick
139:10 - um this is a project with sid chow i'm
139:12 - nick greg
139:13 - um this these are uh
139:15 - it's called conversation which is a duet
139:18 - between two hanging lamps each of these
139:20 - lamps emit light when bitten so the idea
139:23 - here is that in a dark room where this
139:25 - would be the only source of light
139:26 - that this would sort of be tools for
139:28 - listening so that to keep a room
139:31 - lit while also having a conversation you
139:33 - would switch off between talking and
139:35 - otherwise biting or producing the light
139:38 - and so as you look also looking at the
139:39 - sort of mouth as the main switch point
139:41 - for the interaction
139:45 - now are you demonstrating this or uh
139:56 - here so that your your teeth don't go
139:58 - fully out but
140:04 - so yeah the other one's short shorted
140:07 - right now but you could imagine this
140:09 - being a popular tool for
140:10 - dark room in paris cool
140:20 - just tell us your name in a couple
140:22 - sentences about your project um we'll
140:23 - take a look at it yeah absolutely i'm
140:25 - julian matthews this is the hourglass
140:28 - um so there is climate change related
140:31 - data um correlated to um the visual on
140:34 - the sculpture
140:35 - do you want to do the honors or should i
140:37 - do it myself i think okay yeah you got
140:39 - your hands busy gotcha um so this is a
140:42 - statistic related to bees um if the bee
140:45 - disappeared off the face of the earth
140:46 - humans would only have four years left
140:47 - to live
140:48 - um there are some static ones
140:50 - another static one and then these
140:52 - require some user input this is meant to
140:54 - visualize rising sea levels so you can
140:57 - use a slider
140:58 - to
141:00 - demonstrate that
141:02 - this is the approximate hue of the flint
141:04 - river water during peak crisis a little
141:06 - bit terrifying that this was coming out
141:08 - of people's faucets
141:10 - this checks the air quality of any city
141:11 - in the world so wouldn't you want to
141:13 - give me a city
141:15 - this is this is showing paris right now
141:16 - it's moderate brooklyn new york let's
141:18 - put in brooklyn baby
141:22 - we're good
141:24 - but then you could also put in like
141:26 - shanghai for example
141:28 - and you get a not so good value in
141:30 - return um
141:33 - yeah it's been a little bit terrifying
141:35 - seeing people like laugh at that all day
141:36 - because it's actually terrifying but um
141:40 - yeah and then a couple more statistic
141:41 - related
141:42 - visuals and um
141:45 - that's about it awesome can you speak a
141:47 - little bit i might not be clear to
141:48 - people watching live can you speak to
141:50 - what is what this is exactly is not
141:53 - actually three-dimensional for sure
141:55 - display um here let me slide around here
141:57 - sorry
141:58 - um so these are two discs that i
142:00 - actually 3d printed
142:02 - um
142:03 - that once it slows down i attach
142:05 - neopixel strips on the outside and with
142:07 - this motor down here it allows me to
142:09 - spin it at 450 rotations per minute
142:13 - which gives the illusion of these two
142:15 - globes great job yeah thank you
142:17 - appreciate it
142:19 - all right i think maybe we're going
142:21 - around to the hallway yeah
142:47 - all right
142:59 - so this is our lenticular portal room
143:01 - okay oh can you can we both stand next
143:03 - to each other i'm sorry now i'm totally
143:04 - just interrupting no we don't want to
143:06 - kick everybody out oh we're the worst
143:09 - okay all right all right all right all
143:10 - right uh just tell us your names in a
143:11 - few seconds about the project uh so i'm
143:13 - aiden uh fowler i'm nicole kellequito
143:16 - and this is our lenticular portal room
143:17 - so we're doing experiments with a
143:19 - lenticular lens which is if you've seen
143:21 - bookmarks that have moving images that's
143:22 - what we're working with here and it
143:24 - stretches and magnifies the light so
143:25 - we're doing different experiments here
143:27 - we have a three-dimensional box
143:29 - um moving lenses that are rotating and
143:31 - then
143:32 - these flat sun rises over the ocean
143:35 - fantastic all right we'll try to get
143:36 - some footage for people to see all of
143:37 - them now
143:39 - and this one's a mirror so if
143:42 - it's reflecting the top and bottom
143:44 - um yeah cool
143:47 - and over here we're looking at like the
143:49 - bending of the lenticular lens um and
143:51 - also looking at the lens like when it's
143:54 - perpendicular to a light source
143:56 - um
143:57 - it's kind of creating an
143:59 - infinite uh color field if you look
144:02 - through it
144:03 - um
144:04 - and depending on how you're looking at
144:05 - it you can see the the light kind of
144:08 - creates these like pillars um and
144:11 - bending throughout the shape
144:16 - there's nothing there's nothing the best
144:18 - angle for the box there's nothing in the
144:19 - box shall we do the reveal of like what
144:22 - actually is inside it's an empty box
144:24 - it's an empty box wow the secret is
144:26 - revealed
144:28 - but there's a thousand leds in here
144:31 - did you guys
144:32 - do it
144:34 - oh no
144:35 - i thought they were individual and like
144:37 - yeah
144:52 - and this last piece over here is a
144:54 - separate um it's not lenticular this is
144:56 - called dichroic film um and based on the
144:58 - angle of incidence the angle the light's
145:00 - hitting the material a different
145:01 - wavelength of light passes through or is
145:03 - reflected and you can change the speed
145:05 - with this little knob down here so you
145:07 - can turn it from almost a video
145:09 - and then kind of stop motion
145:11 - you just do that again it'll get up
145:23 - super closer yeah amazing great job
145:26 - thanks for coming by all right
146:05 - available okay great um can you both
146:07 - just introduce yourself briefly and tell
146:09 - us a few sentences about your prize oh
146:11 - yeah hi i'm wen i'm from taiwan hi i'm
146:14 - kj i'm from korea yeah so this project
146:17 - is called goddamn voices so this is
146:19 - basically a garden system that is based
146:21 - on word recognition
146:23 - so you can choose the word from the
146:24 - library build and save it to a
146:26 - microphone and see how it goes
146:31 - so
146:33 - i'm obviously going to pick
146:35 - rainbow
146:37 - yeah you can't say it again
146:40 - rainbow
146:46 - so the rainbow or town that water and
146:48 - the water water pump and the light i
146:50 - know the the cheat code
146:53 - revolution
146:58 - revolution
147:06 - so you're trying everything because
147:07 - revolution is the most powerful word
147:10 - for us
147:11 - yeah so this installation is about like
147:14 - the power of words because sometimes
147:15 - it's too
147:17 - it's not as invisible so people just
147:19 - ignore it and want to enforce emphasize
147:22 - that this is so strong that people
147:24 - should pay responsible for it and you
147:26 - should be aware of it
147:28 - great job thank you thank you
147:34 - thank you
147:36 - can you tell us about the project yeah
147:38 - okay yeah
147:39 - because then we can if then we can go
147:41 - inside and the idea of this project is
147:43 - to
147:45 - let people to interact what they are
147:47 - doing in a routine life and um
147:50 - let them be aware of what they're doing
147:52 - because normally sometimes people are
147:55 - like doing their things on wealthy so
147:58 - it's the original idea of this project
148:01 - and
148:02 - yeah so we made a box which can reflect
148:05 - what people are doing in their daily
148:07 - life so we said some of the interactions
148:10 - in the real side room and every
148:12 - connection they're doing their room will
148:14 - be reflected in a small box and just
148:16 - just so we get it can you say your name
148:17 - in the name of the product yeah my name
148:19 - is
148:20 - and here
148:22 - is
148:24 - the creator of this project yeah just
148:26 - say your name so i'll find you funny
148:28 - pineapple yes
148:30 - you can go in but it's one person at a
148:33 - time
148:34 - well do you want to just take the camera
148:36 - in sure
148:40 - okay
149:04 - so you can sit down
149:20 - i yes
149:29 - [Music]
149:38 - so
149:41 - [Music]
149:48 - [Music]
149:54 - okay
149:57 - [Music]
150:12 - laughs
150:18 - time
150:37 - the chair's moving
150:46 - let's deal down
151:01 - that's beautiful
151:03 - very cool
151:06 - thanks
151:15 - sarah pop in there if you want to leave
151:16 - your shoes on you can just sit on the
151:18 - material and hang your feet
151:20 - hey hey can you guys introduce
151:22 - yourselves and tell us a few cents about
151:23 - the project oh yeah
151:25 - yeah get in there
151:27 - uh my name is gilad gillard
151:30 - um the project is called fever dream
151:34 - it is
151:35 - i'm gonna read off the thing a
151:38 - uh
151:39 - experimental light
151:41 - therapy to induce the participant into a
151:42 - fever dream and into another person's
151:44 - memories so it's based off of a personal
151:46 - experience that i had with a fever dream
151:48 - and
151:49 - uh built into an experience where people
151:51 - can
151:52 - try to
151:53 - be in that fever dream
151:55 - yeah
151:56 - built it with nick gregg
151:58 - uh
151:59 - partner in crime uh
152:02 - it's based off of a project that i did
152:04 - in
152:05 - uh
152:06 - called performing reality the class and
152:09 - that's taught by andrew schneider and
152:11 - yeah the best class i took at itp
152:14 - it's just about to start now if you guys
152:15 - wanna go in there yeah
152:18 - so we can kind of look from the side
152:24 - hey
152:50 - you
152:52 - you are
152:55 - asleep
153:12 - so
153:28 - you are
153:30 - in your body
153:32 - in another
153:45 - it's really intense
154:02 - [Music]
154:14 - you
154:19 - are
154:21 - yourself
154:31 - don't
154:42 - you move ready
155:21 - hello
155:22 - oh yes
155:28 - we're almost done
155:46 - come on in this is my project partner uh
155:49 - okay so stand next to me okay so
155:51 - standing next to each other
155:52 - so hey guys how's it going my name is
155:55 - sun liu and my name is chiang kao zhang
155:58 - and we are
156:00 - uh echo of silence as you can see here
156:03 - um
156:05 - our
156:06 - it's working right now so um as you
156:09 - could see earlier when we had the door
156:11 - open uh we left the noise streaming in
156:13 - uh the sculpture stopped all activities
156:16 - um and now we're gonna try and be quiet
156:18 - for a moment and see if something
156:20 - happens
156:28 - and if i keep making noise again and
156:30 - making conversation with you guys it's
156:32 - not supposed to be doing anything and if
156:34 - i keep quiet again
156:42 - beautiful yeah the inspiration
156:45 - basically comes from our own background
156:47 - as technology students we constantly
156:49 - make moving and talking machines
156:52 - and so this time
156:54 - for the winter show we were thinking
156:56 - what if we're making a project that
156:57 - would discourage all activities all the
157:00 - talking all the noisy
157:03 - digital distractions out there and just
157:05 - take a moment to connect
157:07 - more
157:08 - and listening you know closely more to
157:11 - ourselves to the people around us to our
157:13 - environment
157:15 - how would that sound like and how would
157:17 - that feel like
157:19 - thank you so much thank you for stopping
157:20 - by okay
157:24 - okay
157:28 - thank you thanks
157:35 - okay okay
157:36 - uh tell us your name in a few senses
157:38 - about your project yeah sure my name is
157:40 - na and my project's called confession
157:42 - room uh the purpose of is to show
157:45 - solidarity with sexual assault victims
157:47 - in china who were censored during the
157:49 - meeting movement last year
157:53 - so um what is the process of interacting
157:55 - with the project would you like to try
157:58 - i need
158:04 - actually i can yeah i can just play the
158:06 - audio a lot i think it should be fine
158:08 - but i probably could do some coding
158:11 - do mine
158:14 - um i think we just get like some shots
158:17 - of the project
158:18 - um and is there a place where people can
158:20 - find out more about your work online
158:21 - yeah sure
158:25 - so like basically you will hear some
158:27 - background uh story so when you after
158:30 - you sit down you'll hear some background
158:31 - stories of the movement
158:34 - and then it will ask you to read this
158:37 - passage which is the english translation
158:40 - of a real victim story i think this is
158:42 - unplugged
158:46 - i think it's i think it's supposed to be
158:48 - right and then you were reading to you
158:50 - just need to repeat that message and
158:52 - reading that into the microphone
158:56 - and
158:57 - if you get the words right the lies will
158:59 - show up and if you're they're saying
159:01 - they can't hear you're here
159:02 - and if you get the words wrong you will
159:05 - hear some really annoying uh
159:07 - high-pitched beeping okay yeah
159:11 - i'm not sure if it works without the
159:13 - earphones
159:24 - he said it's much better now yeah
159:26 - i had just put it away i forgot what was
159:29 - going on okay there you go this project
159:32 - reflects that you turn it up all the way
159:34 - to movement in china last year
159:37 - sexual cell victims in the country have
159:39 - found it difficult to build their voices
159:41 - out as they are going up against not
159:43 - just the male dominant culture but also
159:46 - the government censorship
159:48 - the following experience might cause
159:50 - emotional distress as the address is
159:53 - sexual violence
159:54 - if you believe that you will find
159:56 - experience to be traumatizing you can
159:58 - choose to not participate
160:01 - if you're willing to proceed read this
160:03 - paragraph out loud repeat the words if
160:06 - you get stuck until the words are
160:09 - highlighted
160:10 - after you're done share your thoughts
160:12 - with us
160:16 - afterwards he drove me home
160:18 - did you get closer
160:20 - afterwards
160:22 - he drove me home
160:24 - and asked
160:26 - me to sit in the front seat
160:28 - stroking my hand he said to me in the
160:31 - tone of an elder
160:33 - do not mention what happened today to
160:35 - anyone i was just testing your moral
160:37 - conduct i only take students who are not
160:40 - just smart but also well behaved you
160:43 - pass the test you must have high morals
160:46 - i was too scared to say anything you've
160:48 - come to the end of this project
160:51 - thank you for giving boys to these
160:52 - victims
160:54 - now take a moment to reflect on
160:56 - experience
160:57 - you can scan a qr code if you like more

163:31 - you can see your pulse be unreal
163:34 - time
163:45 - [Music]
163:46 - i'm glad that you have these freezer
163:48 - bags here it's good to keep that on ice

163:56 - elements uh
163:57 - yeah
164:01 - it's also speaking
164:02 - yes
164:04 - what is it made out of silicon

164:10 - great job thank you
164:13 - okay
164:16 - sort
164:26 - i feel like we're at the nexus of these
164:28 - projects
164:40 - this is from the class called art toy
164:42 - design
164:43 - here at itp
164:53 - okay
165:20 - okay tell us your names and a couple
165:22 - words about your project my name is
165:24 - [Music]
165:32 - this is our steampunk coffee machine and
165:34 - it's designed that people to basically
165:38 - get that perfect cup of coffee that you
165:40 - need for the day because sometimes you
165:41 - just don't know how much coffee you need
165:43 - and
165:44 - you answer a couple questions and it'll
165:45 - tell you exactly how many grams of
165:47 - coffee you might want that day and also
165:49 - the type of coffee
165:51 - and
165:51 - the machine basically gets water from
165:53 - here it goes up and the water comes out
165:56 - and you can also get the perfect
165:57 - measurement for your coffee
165:59 - abby would you like to add a few words
166:01 - yeah sure so if you go ahead and follow
166:03 - me to where little
166:05 - sliders are so you can answer the first
166:07 - question is like
166:08 - how
166:09 - how are you doing today so you got like
166:10 - three options from
166:12 - great to
166:13 - dead basically and it's a
166:16 - and then how strong you like your coffee
166:18 - so whether you want a subtle to a bold
166:21 - cup and then what kind of rose profile
166:23 - you prefer light medium or dark and we
166:25 - actually have three types of beans which
166:26 - are from brooklyn roasting company
166:28 - so
166:29 - based off of your response to some of
166:30 - those questions
166:32 - um
166:32 - or the three questions rather
166:35 - on the first led screen you would get a
166:37 - display of which type of coffee to use
166:39 - and how many grams and then you would
166:41 - weigh out the amount of coffee
166:43 - right on the scale
166:44 - so
166:45 - now we've basically put the coffee into
166:47 - this filter here and are doing moreover
166:49 - coverage
166:50 - for the coffee how many how many cups of
166:52 - coffee have you made do you think that's
166:53 - at least 20 i think
166:55 - yeah between the two days um
167:02 - i would buy i would much rather buy
167:03 - coffee from you on a daily
167:10 - all right
167:33 - can you oh us your name and a couple
167:34 - sentences about your project my name is

167:42 - this is basically a musical instrument
167:44 - that has eight different monophonic
167:46 - synthesizers and we also have a
167:49 - real-time recordable sequencer so we let
167:52 - me show you quickly can i show you okay
167:55 - currently yeah there are some
167:58 - recording clips so i'm gonna clear them
168:00 - you can clear them by double tapping
168:02 - the clips and how it works is basically
168:06 - you just turn on the metronome and then
168:08 - while holding down the clip you
168:12 - and then it will be recorded
168:25 - and then you can even record your
168:28 - knob movements in real time too
168:31 - [Music]
168:33 - and then each rows represent different
168:35 - patterns so you can
168:37 - [Music]
168:39 - record different patterns and then
168:41 - arrange them in real time so it's very
168:43 - suitable for live performance i would
168:45 - say
168:50 - thank you so much
169:13 - all right just so for a minute here

171:41 - have here is an eeg an eeg is an electro
171:44 - encephalogram it's got four electrodes
171:46 - built in here and what it's going to do
171:47 - is it's going to read the electrical
171:49 - activity inside of his brain and he's
171:50 - going to be able to manipulate a
171:52 - javascript animation with it patrick
171:54 - would you like to put this on your
171:55 - forehead i would love to awesome
171:57 - it's easy to go right behind
172:09 - so patrick right now the fireflies are

172:13 - the game sure let the fireflies go
172:15 - just pull it right off
172:17 - awesome we've got our fireflies on the
172:18 - screen when patrick concentrates the
172:20 - fireflies are going to come together
172:22 - patrick's not concentrated the fireflies
172:24 - are just going to be hanging out just
172:25 - like this so when we start the
172:26 - transmission of these brown waves so we
172:29 - have a prompt in the middle of the
172:30 - screen count to five um props are
172:32 - different for everyone so if you want to
172:34 - help focus you can look at that prompt
172:36 - or you can focus on something specific
172:38 - on the screen
172:41 - these are all different um you can use
172:42 - to help focus yeah
172:44 - one of the first people to say this is
172:46 - neither precise or accurate if it
172:47 - doesn't come together on your first try
172:49 - do not worry it's really just the device
172:52 - you do pretty well
172:53 - [Music]
173:04 - [Music]
173:06 - oh yeah and we've also got some excess
173:21 - [Music]

173:24 - over here
173:26 - all right now just tell us your name and
173:28 - finish yourself in a couple sentences
173:29 - about the project hi my name is trendy
173:31 - sauce and this is my project called calm
173:34 - it's an immersive mindfulness-based
173:36 - experience where a person is wearing an
173:38 - eeg headset that's wirelessly connected
173:40 - to my phone and then my computer
173:42 - so they're actually controlling the
173:44 - visualizations as well as the lights
173:46 - with their mind so if somebody is in an
173:48 - unfocused state you can see here the
173:50 - lights are flickering as well as the
173:51 - visualizations and when they're in a
173:53 - more focused piece of mind the lights
173:55 - turn blue as well as the screen so i'm
173:58 - really interested in wellness and tech
173:59 - and how we might use tech to help
174:01 - ourselves
174:02 - instead of using tech as a form of
174:03 - escapism i want to use tech to kind of
174:05 - get more in touch with yourself
174:07 - so i'm doing things like this i'm i've
174:09 - launched a company called design life
174:10 - well at designlifebull.com
174:12 - where you can experience things like
174:14 - this with other artists and free online
174:16 - workshops that use binaural sounds
174:18 - nature or sounds to kind of help you get
174:20 - more in touch with yourself and manifest
174:22 - your dreams so
174:23 - thank you so much thank you it must be
174:25 - hard to get that feeling in this show
174:29 - he's doing a great job

174:53 - femininity
174:55 - an immersive environment that's aimed
174:58 - to let you
174:59 - focus on the feminine sides of your
175:01 - brain which is the ability to birth
175:04 - spread the narration idea
175:07 - so there are a few ways to interact with
175:09 - it besides just to be immersed

175:40 - um
175:42 - yeah and there's like a lot of machine
175:43 - learning used to uh generate all these
175:46 - visual visuals and projections and
175:49 - motion capture and
175:53 - a bunch of technology many robots help
175:56 - me make this as effective as it should
175:58 - be beautiful we've made quite a
176:00 - delightful

177:09 - sort of change
177:10 - what they look like uh you know
177:13 - depending on
177:14 - the nature of the scene and it just it's
177:16 - there's kind of a story that tells us
177:18 - about the cycle of resource consumption
177:20 - um and sort of how how all these three
177:23 - environments interact with each other
177:24 - and feed into each other and there's
177:25 - this system that kind of works
177:26 - beautifully together
177:28 - so are you going to do a performance of
177:30 - it sure all right so why don't we uh

179:30 - cents about your project yeah um i'm
179:33 - hansel lee um
179:34 - i made a like a very very good uh
179:37 - breeding uh forest
179:40 - so those are elements are like indicator
179:42 - abstract traits
179:44 - so by different positions making a
179:46 - different type of space which can
179:49 - give people like a move inside
179:55 - [Music]
180:06 - also the trees are part of nature as
180:08 - well so among the elements of nature it
180:10 - could be exchangeable and replaceable
180:13 - and collected
180:15 - so yeah so i would like to give people
180:18 - just experiencing
180:20 - like
180:22 - inside of the space how they feel it
180:25 - like how uh nature reacts to the human
180:28 - being's reading as well
180:37 - broken um i can do it by manual
180:41 - so before like actually this is
180:43 - my original thing um so
180:47 - when uh foreign
180:49 - it's alone it's breeding their own
180:53 - speed like this
180:55 - and then
180:56 - but once someone's just inside of the
180:59 - corridor
181:20 - [Music]
181:31 - thanks
181:40 - uh just tell us your name and a few
181:42 - sentences about your project sure so my
181:43 - name is vanessa and i made a levitating
181:46 - cube
181:47 - um basically how it works is that this
181:49 - is an electromagnet and i'm running 12
181:52 - current 12 volts through it and then
181:54 - this is a neodymium magnet and what it
181:57 - does it's basically creating kind of
181:58 - like a push-pull dance so when i place
182:01 - it here
182:02 - this red led will turn on and that's
182:05 - kind of how you know that you've hit the
182:06 - sweet spot um and i'm also able to
182:08 - control
182:09 - the distance through this potentiometer
182:12 - um really finicky but very very cool
182:14 - you've gotten a lot of practice i can
182:16 - see oh my god yes
182:17 - before it was like
182:18 - so if i move it too close it'll start to
182:20 - go kind of crazy and it'll stick um
182:23 - and that's that's amazing how big do you
182:25 - think you could make this
182:27 - um like would it work at a much larger
182:29 - scale yeah so if i had a bigger
182:31 - electromagnet um it could carry a pound
182:34 - two pounds three pounds
182:36 - this can carry about an ounce more or
182:37 - less so like a piece of toast is its max
182:39 - yeah
182:40 - put it first next show yeah
182:53 - okay okay can you introduce yourself you
182:56 - can say a couple sentences about your
182:57 - project yes
182:59 - where do i touch you talk to here this
183:00 - is just extra audio
183:02 - lizzie chappini and sydney myers and our
183:05 - project's called color field
183:07 - and it's a interactive light display
183:10 - where the controller can't see what
183:12 - they're manipulating on the
183:15 - screen and the
183:16 - viewer can't see what the controller is
183:19 - doing so through communication they
183:21 - build a light display yeah and the
183:24 - kind of premise of it is we are asking
183:26 - people to choose a word
183:28 - and have a quick conversation about what
183:30 - colors that word evokes for them and so
183:32 - when they sit down at their stations
183:34 - either at the controller or the viewer
183:35 - they're trying to come together
183:37 - with a common goal of having the screen
183:40 - show the color composition of colors
183:43 - that they've kind of talked about to
183:45 - represent the work
183:47 - and have people been successful yeah
183:49 - pretty successful yeah it's really
183:51 - interesting to see how everybody
183:52 - communicates and what
183:55 - they're using you guys want to try
183:57 - definitely let me reset it
184:02 - okay
184:04 - so
184:05 - let's just choose optimism for you okay
184:09 - cool yes
184:11 - and what kinds of colors are evocative
184:13 - of the word optimism
184:15 - um
184:16 - yellow orange
184:18 - red
184:19 - um
184:20 - purple
184:29 - um
184:31 - yellow orange
184:33 - red
184:48 - now you're green now you're pink
184:51 - purple yeah
184:53 - yes you got it you got it perfect are we
184:55 - looking at that or what yeah this is
184:56 - great
184:57 - you get some footage of him just
184:58 - operating the controls
185:01 - and then these are the controls
185:06 - yeah so i'm not sure what's happening uh
185:08 - so she has to tell me what these
185:09 - controllers do
185:11 - and um i think this is like brightness
185:13 - on this one can we make one yellow
185:15 - you're just you just made it all right
185:18 - now it's purple
185:20 - okay um i don't know how to change it
185:25 - great job
185:26 - okay
185:27 - hey we kind of saw like all the projects
185:35 - see everything and look around and
185:36 - listen and then we will have set times i
185:39 - think yeah there's only one project next
185:42 - to the entrance that is
185:46 - so we're going to attempt to take the
185:47 - stairs
185:48 - and we'll see how that goes we might
185:51 - lose our wi-fi that's the other thing
185:52 - who knows what's going to happen wi-fi
185:54 - wise in the lobby although presumably
185:57 - they're all weak
186:12 - wow we have full troop here
186:15 - this is incredible
186:23 - look at all the
186:25 - construction in the stairwell uh very
186:28 - low or yes
186:31 - does it still record
186:32 - yeah well it will it's not recording
186:34 - it's
186:35 - straight yeah it's uploading straight
186:37 - okay
186:49 - so
186:57 - [Music]
187:22 - interfaces for musical expression so we
187:24 - build so we build our own
187:27 - musical instrument and then we perform
187:29 - with it
187:30 - um so
187:32 - my performance did not look like this
187:33 - but it's also a very physical
187:34 - performance and as you can hear it
187:37 - produces a lot of different dissident
187:39 - interesting chaotic sounds
187:40 - [Music]
187:44 - well thank you thank you
187:48 - [Music]
187:57 - i don't
187:59 - [Music]
188:05 - i don't know
188:13 - [Music]
188:41 - [Music]
188:50 - [Music]
189:02 - can you just tell us your name in a few
189:03 - sentences about the project yes mark
189:05 - matsumoto's uh this gentleman wants to
189:07 - play actually maybe get some
189:08 - demonstration at the same time awesome
189:10 - feel free to be aggressive with it so we
189:12 - have basically a controller and we have
189:14 - a
189:15 - synthesizer over there uh two different
189:17 - components so what we have going on is
189:19 - uh ribbon controllers or soft
189:21 - potentiometers on the right hand side
189:23 - and that's controlling your frequency
189:24 - underneath those soft potentiometers are
189:27 - fsrs force sensors um so that's going to
189:29 - control your amplitude so two other
189:31 - potentiometers are soft potentiometers
189:33 - that control
189:34 - uh
189:36 - dynamic and time-based effects um we
189:38 - have a low-pass filter with resonance
189:40 - and we have amplitude modulation
189:42 - uh reverb which is a 0-100 and a global
189:46 - output um but
189:48 - no we've got a technical issue okay hold
189:50 - on a second um let me see like just the
189:53 - capture obviously disconnected
189:57 - that was audio much earlier yeah but i'm
190:00 - just trying to call on skype
190:07 - it's like product description oh god 30
190:09 - seconds
190:16 - [Music]
190:26 - very cool man thank you so much
190:28 - appreciate you sweet oh thank you
190:29 - appreciate it sorry you can finish your
190:30 - sentence now we'll get oh i don't know
190:32 - where is that so we have effects
190:34 - processing on the left hand side six
190:36 - ribbons uh front hand side we have a few
190:38 - knobs um this is for actually sweeping
190:40 - between two different types of
190:41 - oscillators uh square and
190:44 - sawtooth i had to think about that uh
190:46 - three potentiometers three lap switches
190:48 - um
190:49 - each one of these coordinates with their
190:51 - own oscillators so in the
190:53 - as themselves the oscillators for the
190:55 - entire strip it's one octave if we
190:57 - actually have it held down
191:00 - we can go all the way up to three
191:01 - octaves
191:03 - actually hold down at the bottom
191:09 - and we'll go down to that single octave
191:14 - and as mentioned these latches
191:16 - these allow me to actually feed my hands
191:17 - to do something else like
191:23 - so as you see i'm playing standing up
191:25 - right now actually made this to sit down
191:27 - which i'm gonna do and i can do because
191:29 - they're lost
191:31 - so i'll get to that third oscillator
191:36 - [Music]
191:47 - [Music]
191:54 - we're gonna do something kind of
191:55 - dramatic because
191:57 - [Music]
192:11 - so it's really a struggle it's about
192:13 - patience actually finding where you need
192:14 - to be and then adjusting accordingly
192:16 - i've only had a few hours on this so i'm
192:18 - still trying to figure out actually
192:19 - where to play this but i've seen some
192:20 - other people do some interesting things
192:22 - on this
192:23 - thank you so much
192:26 - [Music]
192:37 - [Music]
192:42 - we built a interactive composition
192:44 - together it's an insulation and a piece
192:46 - of music at the same time
192:48 - can you perform it for us yes
192:53 - [Music]
193:05 - [Music]
193:18 - so
193:21 - [Music]
193:33 - so
193:36 - [Music]
194:12 - [Music]
194:35 - thank you so much
194:36 - great thank you uh there's one
194:39 - cool
194:42 - just introduce yourself and tell us a
194:43 - couple sentences then we'll go watch you
194:44 - before yeah i'm joe baker uh this is my
194:47 - performance called ronin it's about a
194:49 - disbanded warrior
194:50 - trying to relive this motions of war
194:54 - try to get him out of his head
194:56 - and
194:57 - this is
195:02 - [Music]
195:16 - so
195:29 - so
195:35 - [Music]
195:46 - um
195:47 - [Music]
196:02 - um
196:09 - [Music]
197:01 - [Music]
197:07 - [Music]

199:13 - [Music]
199:19 - [Music]
199:29 - my name is douglas douglas gold's name
199:32 - here i am with midi blade
199:34 - and i am using the sport of the
199:37 - electronic sport of fencing as my
199:39 - influence toward um
199:41 - finding expression from combat toward a
199:43 - musical output and the human body is an
199:46 - interface for a musical expression
199:50 - so
199:51 - for
199:52 - my basic model here
199:56 - i'm running
199:58 - arduino nano through bluetooth ble
200:02 - and
200:04 - i have it set up so that the pitch and
200:06 - the roll the roll changes my notes
200:10 - for the rotation of my wrist
200:12 - and then
200:15 - [Music]
200:27 - sure
200:29 - [Music]
200:31 - so i'm gonna turn you up now
200:34 - [Music]
200:54 - like if we do
200:58 - [Music]
201:03 - and now let's try doing the same thing
201:06 - [Music]
201:19 - is
201:24 - [Music]
201:26 - and every time you play you'll have a
201:28 - new generative composition as the output
201:31 - so
201:32 - i'm excited to keep developing it thank
201:34 - you very much
201:37 - [Music]
201:38 - i don't know i don't know how many
201:40 - projects that was
201:41 - 128.
201:45 - knows exactly how many of us just give a
201:48 - big thank you to everybody who's been
201:50 - helping with this
