00:11 - [Music]
02:26 - good morning
02:27 - this is my sound check what i would like
02:29 - to know
02:30 - is how is the balance between the
02:32 - background music and my voice because
02:35 - i will be singing today
02:38 - it's all my dreams come true how does
02:41 - this sound to you
02:50 - okay muting my mic we'll be getting
02:52 - started in approximately two minutes
03:09 - [Music]
03:28 - turn down the music my voice should be
03:32 - louder now
03:34 - perhaps this is better let me know
03:37 - when you can
03:46 - [Music]
04:13 - yeah we've come a long way in the year
04:17 - of 2020 though
04:19 - a lot of things
04:23 - sure we had a lot of whoops but we did a
04:27 - lot of coding
04:28 - and the processing foundation lets us
04:31 - keep the
04:32 - engine going on the coding train
04:36 - it comes along and then it takes you
04:39 - away
04:40 - [Music]
04:50 - that keep the train running at its best
04:55 - hello happy holidays welcome
04:58 - to the coding train
05:02 - somehow what seems to be annual holiday
05:06 - telethon end of year live stream for the
05:09 - processing foundation
05:10 - my name is daniel
05:13 - let's see i think it's just shiffman
05:15 - frankly i think that's how it's
05:16 - pronounced
05:17 - but you know i go i all the ways you
05:19 - might pronounce my last name i
05:20 - particularly like to say
05:21 - chief man and i realized that my camera
05:25 - position is a little off and my
05:26 - head is getting cut off um thank you for
05:28 - the compliments on my sweater
05:30 - uh oh there's so many things i need to
05:32 - talk about and i i should just start
05:34 - right at the beginning here but being
05:35 - very clear about what you're watching i
05:38 - have no plan
05:39 - no script no like well i prepared some
05:42 - stuff
05:43 - unfortunately i spent all my time
05:44 - preparing some music nonsense
05:48 - and um very little time preparing any
05:51 - code stuff but that's the sort of point
05:53 - of the coding train
05:54 - it is the act of coding on the train
05:58 - where you don't know where the
05:59 - destination is you might try to stay on
06:01 - the track somewhat
06:02 - because you don't want to you know veer
06:04 - off the tracks and uh this metaphor is
06:06 - not really working out for me right now
06:07 - hi hi hi everybody welcome so first
06:11 - first order of thank you um i want to
06:13 - thank
06:14 - will from america a new um internet
06:16 - friend of mine
06:18 - it's kind of a long story that i won't
06:20 - bother try to explain right now
06:21 - but will from america is um you can find
06:23 - his uh twitter
06:25 - and his website in this video's
06:26 - description is the composer
06:28 - uh music and lyrics of the coding train
06:31 - 2020 holiday processing foundation theme
06:33 - song
06:34 - that you just heard should i play it for
06:35 - you again
06:36 - [Music]
06:37 - um this song by will from america uh
06:40 - will from america
06:40 - and i were uh recently collaborating on
06:43 - a
06:44 - ai generated robot song if that makes
06:47 - any sense
06:48 - and uh he was generous enough
06:51 - to help me uh put together some music
06:54 - for today's
06:55 - holiday telethon i see perhaps
07:00 - i was hoping that there'd be a donation
07:01 - by now come on people
07:04 - my no script plan in my head involves a
07:06 - donation right now let's talk about why
07:08 - you should donate
07:09 - so first of all um if you've never
07:11 - watched the coding train before then
07:13 - i don't know what to tell you um
07:16 - this is me uh home this is by the way
07:18 - this is a momentous occasion because
07:20 - this is the first time i've ever done
07:21 - this annual
07:22 - holiday telethon from my home i am live
07:26 - from the attic of my home in brooklyn
07:30 - um um i'm getting an interesting message
07:33 - here from k
07:33 - weekman that i must bring up onto the
07:35 - screen here i have

08:16 - brain
08:17 - to try to keep this train moving for the
08:19 - next couple hours

08:52 - uh this live stream is for you and we
08:55 - will begin
08:56 - with our holiday random number

12:14 - red button oh look no you see my secret
12:16 - lyric sheet oh no it's there
12:19 - um i am going to go over to the
12:21 - processing foundation website so why are
12:23 - we all here today
12:24 - we are here today to celebrate and raise
12:26 - money for the processing foundation
12:29 - i am incredibly good at by
12:32 - accident or perhaps on purpose talking
12:35 - about the prostate foundation for hours
12:37 - and hours and hours i do want to code
12:39 - some fun little projects today
12:41 - invite you in the community to join me
12:43 - coding these projects
12:44 - i also will be having dorothy santos the
12:47 - executive director
12:48 - of the processing foundation on the line
12:50 - um they'll be calling in
12:52 - from uh through some kind of amazing
12:55 - internet phone video technology the
12:57 - future is here
12:58 - um probably around uh uh 11 a.m eastern
13:02 - so i'm gonna keep my phone here we'll
13:03 - hope i'll get a text message when that
13:05 - arrives
13:05 - but what i want to talk about is if you
13:07 - have ever
13:08 - watched one of my videos you might
13:12 - have noticed that i'm using a particular
13:15 - tool
13:15 - to realize an idea to co to solve a
13:17 - problem to create
13:19 - with code and while i use many different
13:22 - tools
13:23 - probably the tool the set of tools that
13:24 - i use the most come from
13:26 - uh uh the pro come from the processing
13:28 - foundation
13:29 - so um we can go here and look at whoops
13:33 - the uh
13:33 - processing website this is the uh java
13:36 - uh um flexible software sketchbook and
13:39 - language for learning how to code
13:40 - which by the way i don't know if you can
13:43 - do this math
13:44 - but look at this year two zero
13:48 - zero one and we've got another donation
13:50 - everybody
13:54 - thank you anonymous who donated
13:59 - 35 hong kong dollars that's kind of cool
14:02 - all right four nine two four
14:05 - six one one four six five two
14:08 - five one zero two seven one
14:12 - four eight nine eight nine eight eight
14:15 - nine thank you for that wonderful
14:19 - donation
14:22 - this is going to be a real difficult
14:24 - exercise in me trying to keep myself
14:26 - on track because i'm going to take a
14:28 - break for every donation and try to
14:30 - remember where i left off
14:33 - um 2001 that means
14:36 - in the year 2021
14:40 - i've got too many sound effects now the
14:43 - year 2021 do this math
14:45 - is the
14:48 - 20th anniversary
14:51 - of processing that's nuts
14:55 - it's actually kind of crazy 2001 also
14:58 - happens to be the year
15:00 - it's not the first year that i ever did
15:02 - coding in my life
15:03 - because i had done coding as a wee child
15:06 - as a
15:08 - emo teenager i wasn't very emo is that
15:11 - even the right word i'm so
15:12 - old um and a little bit here and there
15:15 - in the uh collegiate
15:16 - times of my life but i hadn't really
15:21 - in a sustained dedicated way
15:24 - learned to code until 2001 and i have
15:27 - somebody to thank for that
15:28 - who i just want to mention there's lots
15:30 - of people to thank but i'm going to
15:31 - mention john henry thompson
15:32 - one of my favorite people um john henry
15:35 - thompson
15:36 - inventor of the lingo programming
15:39 - language
15:40 - used in adobe director because that was
15:41 - the course i took in 2001
15:43 - it's called introduction to
15:44 - computational media why am i even
15:45 - talking about this i'm way off track
15:48 - um but you should learn about john john
15:50 - henry thompson
15:51 - that wonderful fascinating um history um
15:55 - and i have a whole interview and guest
15:57 - video with um
15:58 - with john on the coding train as well
16:00 - but back the reason why i mentioned that
16:02 - is for me
16:02 - lingo and macromedia director was
16:06 - the predecessor too i just want to get
16:09 - this back up here
16:10 - predecessor to processing because while
16:12 - processing was started in 2001
16:15 - um i didn't find it or discover it or
16:18 - learn write any code with it till well
16:20 - not too much later 2003 so i've had many
16:22 - a year
16:23 - um but um um at this program called itp
16:27 - that i've talked about you can check out
16:28 - the idp window show all this stuff but
16:29 - that's not what i'm here to talk about
16:30 - here to talk about processing
16:32 - the processing foundation whoa what am i
16:33 - what about what's happened
16:37 - uh let me close this out here so i'm
16:39 - telling a story it's a nice bedtime
16:41 - story
16:45 - know that okay and then
16:48 - [Music]
16:49 - and then from there
16:52 - i learned this thing called p5.js and
16:54 - now i do stuff in javascript okay that
16:55 - i don't have a plan there all right so
16:58 - actually around 2012
17:00 - if i'm correct um i was one of the
17:03 - people who helped to form the processing
17:04 - foundation
17:05 - which is a non-profit u.s based charity
17:08 - 501c3 tax-exempt
17:10 - organization um and
17:14 - um it was you know forming the
17:16 - foundation if you know i'm speaking in
17:17 - my own words here
17:18 - was one of the reasons amongst many was
17:21 - to have a
17:22 - to to really have some sort of dedicated
17:26 - structure and framework for sustaining
17:29 - the open source projects and the
17:30 - community in the long term that is
17:33 - a very difficult thing to do is a
17:35 - difficult thing to do financially
17:37 - emotionally uh energy wise
17:40 - i know that many of you who are viewers
17:42 - have participated in open source
17:44 - projects maybe you've created your own
17:45 - open source
17:46 - projects so one of the ways the
17:48 - processing foundation sustains itself
17:50 - is through donations from
17:54 - viewers like you but i do really want to
17:55 - start here and emphasize
17:57 - how valuable all contributions are
18:01 - many of you watching are not able to
18:03 - donate maybe
18:04 - you can't even like use the youtube
18:06 - transaction feature
18:07 - in your wherever you are in the world
18:10 - today it's not unlocked for your country
18:12 - i do have another way that you can
18:13 - donate if that's the case maybe you
18:14 - don't have the means to donate financial
18:16 - support it's not something everybody is
18:18 - struggling right now
18:19 - uh or many people are everybody's
18:21 - dealing with different challenges so i
18:22 - want to acknowledge that
18:24 - and say that just the act of watching
18:26 - this being here
18:28 - giving some positive energy to the
18:29 - community making writing some code
18:31 - helping a friend of yours learn
18:33 - something about code all of those things
18:35 - are really important meaningful
18:36 - contributions that you can make
18:38 - and i don't want to over emphasize
18:41 - the financial aspect but it is a crucial
18:44 - key aspect um people who work on these
18:47 - projects
18:47 - need to be able to have the time to do
18:49 - it need to be able to be compensated for
18:50 - that time and we also have
18:52 - a lot of advocacy and education
18:54 - initiatives the fellowship program
18:56 - is one that i would love to highlight i
18:57 - should just notice note
18:59 - that the uh fellowship call for 2021 has
19:03 - actually been pushed back a little bit
19:04 - so the fellowships are going to occur
19:06 - in summer 2021 so i really encourage you
19:08 - right here right now if you've never
19:10 - heard of the processing foundation
19:11 - before if you've watched maybe a coding
19:14 - train video
19:14 - or two and wanted to know how can you
19:16 - get involved how can you find someone to
19:18 - support
19:19 - this dream project of yours um that's
19:22 - what the processing foundation
19:23 - is for and i'm just i love that the
19:25 - first one is coming up here is aaron
19:27 - davey
19:27 - because it's one of the fellowship
19:28 - projects that i know uh probably the
19:30 - most about because i worked with aaron
19:31 - on her
19:32 - twitch channel called cozy coding um i
19:35 - don't know when aaron is doing her next
19:37 - live stream
19:38 - if it would be so amazing we're just
19:39 - like this afternoon i could send
19:41 - everybody there
19:42 - um but um this is uh the processing
19:45 - fellowship program supports
19:47 - new artists new programmers new
19:49 - activists
19:50 - uh and uh and i don't know why i'm using
19:52 - the word new uh um
19:54 - people young and old who are working on
19:56 - projects
19:57 - uh to expand the uh community of of
20:01 - creative coding of processing and p5.js
20:03 - and i encourage you to
20:04 - continue uh to take a look at all these
20:06 - wonderful people who have worked on
20:08 - various projects and
20:11 - [Music]
20:13 - thank you anonymous

21:55 - donation uh page for this year i will
21:58 - note
22:00 - i don't even know how to express my
22:02 - utter
22:03 - amazement joy and just sheer shock
22:06 - perhaps even
22:08 - that you know i was kind of like oh
22:09 - kevin do my telethon towards the tail
22:11 - end of the month-long giving program
22:13 - and i'm gonna push us over the edge
22:15 - we're gonna be right down there below 30
22:17 - thousand of our goal and i
22:19 - the coding trade will push us over the
22:20 - top guess what already over
22:22 - are you over the top but guess but you
22:24 - know what that doesn't mean
22:26 - uh uh we don't need more donations from
22:29 - you so let's see if we can raise this up
22:31 - my goal for today
22:32 - is to uh raise 1 000 for the processing
22:36 - foundation and i will be matching that
22:38 - donation so we can make it all the way
22:39 - up to one thousand done
22:40 - the coding train will match uh that
22:42 - donation uh to the processing foundation
22:45 - now
22:46 - what's really quite exciting here is
22:49 - that with your donation and this
22:51 - includes
22:52 - the donations that you're making on
22:53 - youtube today
22:57 - um by the way is there an advent of code
23:00 - challenge today that's something i could
23:01 - work on
23:02 - um uh donors who give at the variable
23:05 - level
23:07 - with a uh 25 donation we'll receive a
23:10 - pack of
23:10 - 10 p5.js and processing stickers
23:13 - i mean come on look at those stickers oh
23:16 - i have some of them here

23:26 - just to be clear about this
23:28 - if you donate through the donor box
23:30 - system
23:31 - or whether you're doing it through donor
23:33 - box or through the youtube button that's
23:34 - there on this
23:35 - stream page the money will go to the
23:37 - prostate foundation that's the important
23:38 - part
23:40 - if you donate through the donor box
23:42 - system you will definitely get your
23:44 - rewards because there's a whole system
23:45 - set up for that
23:48 - if you donate through youtube you will
23:50 - get a receipt by email
23:52 - and you should email that receipt to
23:54 - foundation
23:57 - processing.org so i think i can bring
24:00 - that up on the screen
24:02 - uh um let me just test my little system
24:05 - out to make sure it's
24:07 - working um

24:15 - up here oops no come on people
24:18 - um and back i go
24:22 - here there so that's the very long
24:25 - long-winded way of me putting
24:27 - uh foundation at processing.org um on
24:30 - the page so please if you donate through
24:32 - youtube uh processing foundation will
24:34 - get the funds but not a notification of

24:38 - it comes as just one lump sum at the end
24:40 - of the youtube
24:41 - uh fundraising thingamabob
24:44 - so um you'll need to send forward your
24:46 - receipt to foundation

29:42 - i want to get overwhelmed
29:46 - i want to get overwhelmed that means
29:48 - people are donating
29:49 - although i don't want to create a
29:50 - situation where i'm motivating people
29:52 - not to donate because they just so
29:54 - desperately want me to stop singing the
29:55 - random numbers but i have a feeling
29:57 - knowing the way the internet works the
30:00 - way that i've experienced the internet
30:02 - in all of my years on the internet is
30:04 - that people will want to torture me
30:06 - and even torture themselves
30:10 - oh boy i'm being uh all right so

32:22 - video prints are i was not familiar with
32:24 - them i'm obsessed with them right now
32:27 - on their website late last night like
32:30 - looking at all the different infinite
32:31 - objects things i could buy

32:48 - is of the gif the looping animation
32:52 - by dave white otherwise known as bees
32:56 - and bombs so bees and bombs i'm
32:59 - frequently referring to on the coding
33:01 - train uh make do having very poor
33:03 - attempts to recreate
33:05 - various uh famous bees and bombs gifts
33:08 - and you can have your very own print uh
33:12 - video print video installation sculpture
33:14 - i might call it
33:16 - by making a donation uh to the
33:18 - processing foundation
33:19 - at the functions level by the way do you
33:21 - like the names of these levels
33:22 - i just have to bat myself on the back
33:24 - somebody will correct me if i'm sticking
33:26 - this idea from somebody else
33:27 - i hope the universe will strike me down
33:29 - i'm pretty sure it was my idea to call
33:30 - them
33:31 - loops functions erase
33:35 - and now raise
33:38 - you get what you already always just get
33:41 - anyway
33:45 - at the erase level you will be able to
33:47 - adopt
33:48 - you know kind of like how you have that
33:50 - sign on the highway that says adopt a
33:51 - highway only you can adopt
33:53 - a p5.js function or a processing
33:55 - function
33:56 - um and uh psy and i will work with you
34:00 - to select a code element from processing
34:02 - or p5 to
34:03 - create a video tutorial that will appear
34:05 - live on not live but will be
34:07 - uh published to the coding train
34:10 - hopefully in january i'm looking to do
34:11 - this
34:12 - january 2021 putting that out there into
34:14 - the universe
34:15 - these this reward this reward of a

34:24 - collaborate with you if it makes sense
34:25 - to do so

36:30 - surprised songs for you today um and

36:34 - will lead us into the very first piece
36:37 - of code
36:38 - that i want to write with all of you
36:40 - today on
36:42 - the coding train processing foundation
36:44 - holiday
36:52 - telethon let's just let's just listen to
36:55 - the theme song for a second while i get
36:56 - myself set up

38:24 - i was in the middle of um
38:28 - getting myself set up for my next song
38:31 - so as i like to do on the coding train
38:34 - holiday telethon i like to
38:36 - embarrass myself as much as possible
38:39 - lest you think that i am singing for you
38:42 - because i think you think that i think
38:45 - that i can sing
38:48 - don't be mistaken i know that it's
38:51 - terrible
38:53 - it does bring me a lot of joy to sing
38:55 - even if it is
38:56 - you know out of tune or nasally or kind
38:58 - of like weird sounding
39:00 - my children are not so thrilled with my
39:02 - singing especially if it ever happens in
39:04 - public
39:05 - my dancing however they really do they
39:07 - don't like that either
39:08 - they did when they were little when they
39:09 - were so small they would laugh and they
39:11 - would smile and now just kind of like
39:14 - they try to like hug me as if hugging me
39:16 - will get me to stop
39:18 - which is nice it's a good way to get a
39:19 - hug what was i talking about
39:21 - anyway so i'm here to sing you this song
39:24 - very excited about this one this one is
39:25 - kind of holiday adjacent
39:27 - but i feel like it works and it's going
39:28 - to lead me into the first
39:30 - bit of code that i will write in today's
39:33 - holiday telethon
39:37 - i'm trying to decide if i can manage
39:39 - this without
39:41 - by the way i have two so thank you again

44:04 - they host a live stream and there's
44:06 - different people for different segments
44:08 - i might need to start thinking about
44:09 - that this is really i gotta keep keep
44:11 - things going here and get my mind on
44:13 - track what am i doing next
44:15 - i know what i am doing next what i am
44:18 - doing next
44:20 - is
44:25 - oh i didn't even play the one with the
44:26 - lower key that was done for me
44:29 - do you want to code a snowman
44:32 - we can color with rgb
44:36 - we can coat a stack of circles and a
44:38 - triangle
44:39 - for a nose looks pretty sweet
44:43 - you've just got to use ellipse stroke
44:46 - weight background
44:47 - and then add a fill that's white
44:53 - do you wanna coat a snowman
44:56 - it doesn't have to be a snowman
45:00 - okay bye
45:07 - um all right so we're gonna program a
45:08 - snowman in p5 we've got a nice
45:11 - question here that k weekman has passed
45:13 - to me
45:14 - um good question from the chat zachary
45:16 - macarthur asks
45:19 - do a lot of your students come into your
45:21 - class knowing you from your videos
45:24 - or does it usually go the other way
45:29 - oh by the way taran in the chat has
45:31 - something to release an album
45:32 - do i have an album cover for you
45:36 - oh boy hold on let me answer this
45:38 - question somebody remind me
45:40 - that i gotta share with you i was
45:41 - waiting for it to be christmas which i
45:43 - don't by the way i don't even celebrate
45:45 - that darn
45:46 - christmas holiday i mean i do because
45:48 - it's a long story i've got a very
45:50 - multi-holiday celebratory family thing
45:52 - going on these days which is wonderful
45:54 - we can have all the presents for all the
45:56 - days of all the different holidays it's
45:57 - not overwhelming at all
46:01 - i really like christmas trees is it okay
46:03 - to admit that i like
46:04 - christmas trees
46:08 - hey i always say can we just get like a
46:10 - little teeny one tiny little small
46:11 - christmas tree
46:12 - just put it on the shelf put on the
46:14 - shelf next to the elf is that where the
46:16 - elf goes on the shelf
46:17 - i don't know um so this is a good
46:20 - question
46:20 - i would say that it really depends it's
46:23 - probably about 50
46:25 - 50. more so i definitely have students
46:29 - who have come into the class and will
46:30 - come into class and say oh
46:32 - um you know i like your videos or i've
46:33 - watched your videos i'm excited to be in
46:35 - your class blah blah that kind of thing
46:36 - i would say a lot of that however is not
46:38 - because
46:40 - you know they've actually seen them in
46:43 - in
46:43 - uh sort of accidental ways but because
46:46 - they
46:47 - knew they were going to take classes on
46:48 - maybe program with b5js
46:50 - and kind of did some research and have
46:52 - tried it before and so it's hard
46:54 - i think probably if you're kind of
46:56 - searching the internet for all of the
46:58 - resources ready to
46:59 - p5.js i imagine that a lot of my videos
47:01 - come up pretty often although
47:04 - uh there are so many other wonderful
47:07 - ones out there
47:08 - there are just like you know i mentioned
47:09 - aaron davies twitch channel so
47:11 - i i don't i want to list more but then
47:13 - i'm afraid of leaving people out
47:14 - so i will just uh hold that thought i'll
47:17 - put a pin in that maybe i can publish a
47:18 - list of you know
47:20 - i don't want to say like best p5.js or
47:22 - processing resources in 2020 but like
47:23 - some of my favs or whatever
47:25 - um thank you for that question um zack
47:29 - i have to say though where i do i mean
47:32 - not anymore because
47:33 - uh i don't know if you noticed global
47:35 - pandemic
47:37 - but um before uh last march of 2020
47:40 - i would find myself recognized randomly
47:43 - most often
47:44 - in nyu tandon's one of the nyu tandon
47:46 - buildings
47:48 - which is the nyu school for engineering
47:50 - and people would be like
47:51 - flummoxed just to like why i was there
47:54 - um whereas in the uh the tisch
47:57 - departments which is the
47:58 - school of the arts where i teach um you
48:01 - know mostly know people already
48:03 - so they're not surprised to see me okay
48:07 - um we've got some is that some kind of
48:10 - norwegian currency
48:12 - that is amazing
48:16 - oh my god we're gonna get to that
48:17 - snowman thank you anonymous anonymous
48:19 - really likes to donate
48:22 - can we start coding at smithich i get it
48:25 - yeah i i feel the same way i feel like
48:27 - you
48:27 - three five three three four six one nine
48:30 - one two three
48:31 - two seven nine one zero nine four one
48:35 - nine six one nine eight two seven zero
48:38 - one
48:39 - one okay
48:43 - um rogue is asking a really important
48:45 - question does
48:46 - youtube take a cut from the fundraiser
48:49 - donations like they do from regular
48:50 - donations
48:51 - they do not from what i understand uh
48:53 - through the youtube giving platform
48:55 - this is very different than if you've
48:57 - ever done a super chat or a
48:59 - membership payment for a youtube channel
49:00 - those are commercial transactions that
49:03 - go
49:03 - to the creator the owner of the channel
49:05 - with youtube taking
49:06 - quite a large percentage of 30 um
49:10 - but with the youtube giving uh at least
49:12 - so i'm told and everything in the past
49:14 - that i participated in leads me to
49:16 - believe that it is true
49:17 - um 100 including all the transaction
49:19 - fees are covered
49:20 - go to the processing foundation and i
49:23 - can tell you it's true because i
49:24 - actually go to the processing
49:25 - foundation's mailbox
49:26 - and get the check that comes and look at
49:29 - it so and then deposit it into the bank
49:31 - into the processing foundation's bank
49:32 - account little known fact you're looking
49:34 - at the processing foundation banker
49:36 - right here although
49:37 - um many new uh exciting people are
49:40 - joining the processing community and
49:42 - processing
49:42 - uh who will be or i don't wanna i don't
49:44 - wanna like
49:46 - scoop any announcements so
49:50 - so yeah uh let me just check see if i
49:51 - any messages from dorothy
49:53 - um not yet so um i think we're good to
49:57 - go i'm gonna keep going
49:58 - and i am going to move on
50:01 - to writing some code so let's make a
50:04 - snowman so why are we making this
50:05 - snowman
50:07 - um let me get over to the coding train
50:10 - discord
50:13 - okay so uh here we are
50:16 - so by the way if you um haven't uh
50:19 - joined the i'm gonna
50:20 - put a link into uh the chat right now um
50:23 - codingtrain has a discord
50:25 - um you know since this is a processing
50:27 - foundation i'm doing this coding train
50:29 - live stream as a
50:30 - fundraiser for the processing foundation
50:32 - i should certainly mention
50:34 - um the processing forum you know one of
50:36 - the most frequently asked questions i
50:38 - definitely get is where do i get help
50:39 - with my code um
50:42 - i'm kind of an obsessive completionist
50:44 - and i try to answer
50:45 - every email that i get uh that has i've
50:48 - it's been about two years since i've
50:49 - actually been able to continue that up
50:51 - so if you write me an email
50:53 - with a code question chances are it will
50:56 - it will
50:56 - get lost into the ether of the of the
50:59 - internet but
51:00 - um if you post on the processing forum
51:03 - there is a helpful and wonderful
51:05 - community there that can help you with
51:07 - your questions about processing and
51:08 - p5.js and coding
51:10 - there's kind of community forums there's
51:12 - a post about the
51:14 - fundraiser if you have job opportunities
51:16 - uh
51:17 - art call for proposals or
51:21 - calls for participation in a conference
51:23 - or an art show though there that's a
51:25 - platform for you to use to post or to
51:27 - find those kind of opportunities
51:29 - but all in addition and these are
51:31 - separate things but the coding terrain
51:32 - is
51:32 - at the as the youtube channel itself has
51:34 - a discord so that's what you're looking
51:36 - at right here
51:38 - most recently in 2020 i've been working
51:40 - on a series of how to code a discord bot
51:42 - tutorial i have a song about box
51:46 - coming up soon um and
51:50 - um so i encourage you to join uh the
51:53 - discord
51:54 - and there are many um channels here
51:57 - under help and discussion in particular
52:00 - that you can ask questions and share
52:02 - work
52:03 - and join with the coding train community
52:05 - but the reason why i'm going there now
52:07 - is one of the things that i do when i
52:08 - live stream
52:09 - is i use this channel called links so
52:12 - schedules where i post
52:13 - updates and announcements about the live
52:15 - streaming schedule
52:16 - and then links is where i'll post links
52:18 - to things that i am
52:20 - talking about um during the live stream
52:23 - and
52:23 - uh k weekman here thankfully i already
52:25 - posted the processing foundation
52:27 - donate link um and now
52:30 - i'm going to show you two sketches
52:33 - prepared by
52:34 - members of the coding train community
52:36 - made in p5.js because
52:38 - as of today i am launching an exciting
52:41 - something as part of this fundraising
52:44 - initiative for us all to make
52:46 - p5.js holiday cards and share them with
52:50 - each other
52:51 - on the internet so i think we need a
52:53 - hashtag for this
52:55 - i'm not so sure how we're going to do
52:56 - this if we use twitter or instagram or
52:58 - the discord or what but um
53:01 - let's take a look at these so let's take
53:03 - a look at both of these sketches real
53:05 - quick let's look at this first one so
53:06 - first of all the um in in discord
53:10 - if i just type in uh the command snow
53:12 - globe
53:13 - i will get a link to this particular
53:15 - sketch
53:16 - and uh here we will see this particular
53:19 - sketch is made by coding train viewers
53:22 - and these are their discord user names
53:24 - saint plays 7380 and
53:26 - youfu042 isn't it great
53:29 - how discord you get a random number
53:32 - associated with your name it's
53:33 - everything i ever wanted for the coding
53:34 - terrain community
53:36 - everybody gets their own random number
53:37 - uh let's take a look at this
53:39 - one so this is a snow globe
53:42 - sketch so you can see it's got the
53:45 - coding train characters in it
53:46 - it has a happy holidays message and it
53:49 - has
53:49 - this snowfall happening there so what
53:52 - are some things
53:53 - that you might do how might you make
53:55 - your own versions of this
53:57 - is it that you create a design that
53:59 - lives in the snow globe
54:00 - can you make it interactive some way i
54:02 - wonder if you can make a mobile version
54:03 - where you
54:04 - should shake it up and it starts to
54:06 - scatter all the snow
54:07 - lots of possibilities with this sketch
54:10 - and i'm going to show you
54:11 - one more sketch now i'm going to go to
54:14 - um what's this one called holiday card
54:21 - hi dan hi everybody
54:25 - nice to see you very clever your use of
54:27 - emoji
54:29 - ah the utes okay and this is created by
54:34 - consti3204 on
54:37 - uh uh on discord who created this system
54:40 - by which to place a p5.js sketch
54:44 - inside of a card look at it opens and
54:47 - there
54:47 - is a nice tree um and then of course
54:50 - it's like a nice little webgl world
54:52 - and you can have my sketch so i think i
54:54 - might start with this one
54:56 - because well actually what i'm going to
54:57 - do is i'm going to show you the process
54:58 - first i'm going to make my own
55:00 - snowman
55:05 - i'm gonna make my own snowman and
55:08 - i'm going to make it in p5.js and then
55:10 - i'm going to try to put it in this card
55:12 - and put a message on it and invite you
55:15 - all the viewers to make your own all
55:17 - right how does that sound
55:21 - konsti 219 is in the youtube chat right
55:24 - now hi consti
55:25 - thanks so much for working on this
55:27 - [Music]
55:31 - okay so let's duplicate this oh actually
55:34 - so let's go to uh let's go to a blank
55:36 - sketch first
55:39 - doorway daniel oh how rude
55:45 - okay so what
55:50 - what um what should i do here
55:53 - i'm taking suggestions from the from
55:56 - those of you the viewers of the coding
55:58 - train let's see what let's i guess let's
56:00 - start with the most
56:01 - rudimentary idea for a snowman
56:07 - one of the things i would like to think
56:09 - about maybe here is parametric design
56:11 - so how might i code a snowman so that
56:14 - every time i
56:15 - write the sketch i get a slightly
56:17 - different
56:18 - snowman so there's some rules that
56:20 - generate the design but they're
56:21 - different each time but let's just make
56:23 - one
56:23 - um i'm going to click this auto refresh
56:27 - which i almost never do but i'm very
56:28 - excited to try it right now
56:30 - let's put uh
56:35 - we need a fill that's white
56:38 - okay that's looking pretty good so far
56:42 - um ah so kobe thank you um
56:45 - is uh um is saying that there's more
56:47 - information about
56:48 - how to there we're actually doing a
56:51 - little bit of a holiday giveaway as well
56:53 - on the coding train
56:54 - um and so you can submit your sketches
56:56 - as part of that holiday giveaway and
56:57 - there's information
56:58 - about that and announcements okay so
57:01 - um let's all right that's our first
57:05 - okay now what i want to do i want to
57:07 - have another one but i want to move it
57:10 - up
57:12 - maybe make it smaller
57:20 - pretty close i guess they should sit
57:21 - right on top of each other right
57:23 - so if this one is at
57:27 - 300 and its height is 200
57:31 - then the other one is at well let's make
57:33 - this simpler let's just
57:34 - let's make this at one make the math
57:36 - simpler and then
57:41 - oops this would set them on top of each
57:44 - other
57:45 - but if i want to shrink it if i
57:48 - take it down by a hundred
57:53 - whoops if i shrink the circle
57:56 - to 100 and then move it down by 50
58:01 - it will sit right on top of course i
58:03 - want it to be a circle
58:06 - okay this is going well i'm so close to
58:08 - having a snowman
58:12 - uh okay uh let's see
58:15 - now next um
58:20 - let's add one more
58:25 - let's move this one up to
58:28 - 50 and then
58:32 - let's move let's make it 50 in size
58:36 - and move it down to 75.
58:41 - is this the appropriate ratio of circles
58:45 - in a snowman
58:46 - i'm not so sure also i feel like maybe i
58:49 - need some more
58:50 - uh some more space to work with here
58:54 - uh-oh um
58:57 - so let's see i don't know by the way no
58:59 - plan here i'm just trying to make a
59:01 - snowman
59:02 - with some circles that are white trying
59:04 - to follow my instructions
59:09 - oh my god it's getting warm in this hat
59:12 - with this
59:13 - holiday sweater on what should i do next
59:18 - people are really discussing other
59:19 - things besides my amazing incredible
59:21 - snowman design i think i need some
59:23 - motivation here
59:34 - what if we had the snowman like wobble
59:38 - if i attached some springs
60:00 - throw away daniel
60:07 - okay this is getting better larger
60:18 - oh look at that snowman
60:22 - okay oh this is getting good this is
60:23 - getting good people
60:33 - i think we're getting a good snow there
60:35 - we go this looks pretty good
60:41 - buttons carrot nose hat pipe okay so i
60:44 - think we need to turn this into an
60:46 - algorithm
60:47 - right i want to have the
60:50 - snow i want to turn this into an
60:52 - algorithm so
60:54 - what is the what's the sort of like key
60:56 - property that i would pick
60:57 - to sort of define and start the snowman
61:00 - i think it would be probably
61:02 - the size of the bottom circle so let's
61:05 - create
61:06 - a variable i'm just going to say
61:09 - no loop for a second to only run it once
61:12 - let's create a variable
61:14 - called r and that will be a random
61:16 - number
61:17 - between 100 and uh
61:21 - 200. and so that
61:24 - by definition will be the radius
61:27 - of the bottom um circle now should i do
61:31 - this i should probably write this as a
61:32 - loop
61:34 - so we're going to start with y is equal
61:37 - to
61:38 - the height of the canvas minus
61:43 - that radius and we want to draw
61:47 - three circles
61:50 - and so the first one will be at ellipse
61:52 - and let's just draw one
61:53 - first the first one will be at the y
61:56 - position
61:58 - golden ratio i like this idea rudra
62:01 - we're gonna let's let's think about
62:03 - using the golden ratio
62:04 - um y um
62:08 - and x is always going to be um the
62:11 - middle for right now
62:15 - yes uh
62:21 - uh okay yes this is where i'm going this
62:23 - is uh we got this uh
62:25 - suggestion from the chat from stieg
62:27 - specified snowman ball
62:29 - size coal eyes carrot notices
62:30 - percentages relative overall yes yes
62:32 - this is where i'm going we think alike
62:34 - we think alike thank you for this um and
62:37 - violet says
62:38 - it would look better without the stroke
62:40 - but that's a that's something i can make
62:42 - happen
62:42 - very very quickly um so uh
62:45 - y um x and then r
62:48 - times two and in fact uh p5
62:53 - does have a function called circle so i
62:54 - can also just use that
62:56 - um so let's comment these out
63:01 - what's going on here oh you know what x
63:04 - x goes before
63:04 - y there we go
63:08 - okay so then uh
63:11 - r equals r times let's just
63:15 - let's just use 90 let's shrink it by
63:18 - 90 percent uh so let's make it 75
63:20 - percent
63:22 - and then y minus equals
63:26 - uh oh i guess i um so first i should
63:30 - move y
63:32 - to the edge and then shrink it then move
63:35 - it to the edge again
63:37 - and we should get a two
63:41 - there we go so now right what i'm doing
63:44 - here is i'm starting with if i sort of
63:46 - zoom in here
63:47 - i start with this point right then i
63:51 - move by the um i move
63:54 - by its radius shrink the radius move by
63:57 - that's radius and then draw the next
63:58 - circle now
63:59 - what is the golden ratio we i was going
64:02 - to make a random ratio but this could be
64:04 - interesting to grab the golden ratio
64:08 - um let's see if i can get it as a
64:10 - decimal number
64:12 - uh i can't copy that
64:16 - uh irrational number solution to the
64:18 - quad should i just solve for it
64:20 - should we solve this quadratic equation
64:22 - i could say 1 plus
64:24 - square root of 5 divided by 2. we could
64:25 - do that
64:29 - so let's let's make a constant
64:34 - equals 1 plus
64:38 - square root of 5 divided by
64:44 - two is that the golden ratio
64:48 - and uh you know i'm outside of um
64:50 - [Music]
64:53 - i'm outside of setup and draw so i'm
64:55 - going to say this let's just see if i
64:57 - got
64:57 - about the right number here
65:03 - that looks pretty good but of course i
65:05 - want to divide by it
65:08 - so i need to say times 1 divided by
65:11 - golden
65:13 - so there's the golden ratio and now we
65:15 - just need to get the third
65:19 - there we go that looks kind of nice
65:23 - and it's sort of silly what i just did
65:25 - because
65:27 - um i could in fact
65:30 - just say 2 divided by this up here
65:34 - well i've made some really interesting
65:35 - things happen
65:45 - and all right so clearly the
65:50 - if i'm using this what is the sort of
65:52 - largest size
65:57 - yeah that's way too big so let's um
66:01 - let's just see what uh 150 gets us yeah
66:04 - 150 is the full
66:06 - size so that should be all right so now
66:09 - every time i run this
66:11 - i get a new snowman stack
66:16 - pretty good let's get rid of this stroke
66:24 - might be fun to animate this somehow not
66:32 - sure what color the background should be
66:33 - in this case
66:35 - all right there's our beginning of our
66:37 - snowman
66:38 - oh it's lovely it's just delightful cold
66:40 - buttons
66:44 - oh where do the buttons
66:48 - go
66:51 - the golden ratio is traditionally called
66:53 - fee yes that is true
66:56 - [Music]
66:58 - um
67:01 - um where do the buttons go in a snowman
67:06 - i should know this right if i look at
67:08 - like the snowman emoji
67:10 - is that going to help me buttons here
67:15 - okay let's put some buttons
67:19 - so now we need
67:22 - um
67:26 - if i equals zero so when we're on the
67:28 - first circle
67:30 - let's draw a um
67:37 - let's draw a nice little black circle
67:45 - and say are the
67:48 - you know i should really use translate
67:50 - so x let's just
67:52 - let's just draw a one button see how
67:54 - this goes
67:56 - r times like 10 whoops
68:04 - that's about the size of a button i
68:05 - think maybe we can make it a little bit
68:06 - bigger
68:09 - that's at the center so y minus r
68:12 - times 0.2
68:16 - and y plus r times 0.2
68:19 - okay how's that two buttons is two
68:22 - buttons good
68:23 - three buttons
68:27 - the circles should be overlapped i agree
68:30 - that makes a lot of sense
68:31 - it's gonna look a little better okay we
68:33 - can make that happen good suggestion
68:35 - from the chat
68:39 - good suggestion from the chat here
68:42 - what how do i want to do that um
68:46 - let's not go let's do like let's go
68:50 - like 95 percent of the way up
68:53 - yeah maybe a little bit more even
68:58 - how do we like this this is looking a
69:00 - little better maybe even more actually
69:02 - i'm realizing now that now that i've
69:04 - i'm overlapping them
69:08 - i think that's kind of nice okay oh
69:12 - we've got a donation

73:22 - [Music]
73:25 - ah this really i'm telling you this
73:28 - seemed like such a good idea earlier
73:29 - today when i thought of reading random
73:31 - numbers for people who donate
73:33 - [Music]
73:37 - dorothy is here dorothy i would like to
73:40 - know from dorothy
73:41 - when it is
73:45 - how much longer you are available
73:46 - because i would i'm attempting to finish
73:48 - off
73:49 - this p5.js snowman and then i believe
73:52 - after that would be a great time for you
73:54 - to call in and talk a bit about the
73:55 - processing foundation
73:56 - um but i don't know i know you have some
73:58 - other meetings and things maybe today
74:00 - so let me know if you have a time that
74:02 - you have to leave by and i will make
74:03 - sure to bring you in by then
74:05 - everyone say hi to executive director of
74:07 - the pressing foundation
74:08 - in the chat dorothy santos
74:16 - okay all right we're gonna go with
74:19 - natto's suggestion
74:21 - of a random number
74:24 - of buttons so this is where
74:28 - i'm doing the butt so we're gonna need
74:29 - another loop so
74:32 - let's get a um number
74:37 - well we want at least two buttons and
74:40 - maybe let's go between two
74:42 - and four so this would be two three or
74:44 - four this should give me two three or
74:46 - four buttons
74:47 - and then i need um
74:51 - how much space do i have um
74:54 - well i guess i could do i'm doing this
74:57 - in such a strange way
74:59 - um but it's just the way my brain is
75:01 - telling me to do it right now
75:03 - so let's do this
75:06 - like just for the sake of argument
75:10 - um if i do
75:13 - this y um
75:16 - let's just do this just to y plus
75:20 - uh j times r
75:25 - i'm just going to do something really
75:26 - silly here for a second
75:31 - okay so every time i run this i'm going
75:35 - to get a bunch of buttons sort of spaced
75:36 - out by some
75:37 - arbitrary amount so what is the
75:40 - total length that i want to have the
75:44 - button
75:44 - spaced between so the total length
75:48 - that the buttons should be i'm going to
75:50 - make that basically r so that's going to
75:52 - be r
75:52 - so d r is r divided by the number of
75:57 - buttons
75:58 - and so this would be y
76:01 - plus j times dr
76:06 - so that's two buttons right so no matter
76:09 - what
76:10 - the buttons are spaced out but they're
76:13 - not
76:14 - centered so they should go this is like
76:17 - really
76:18 - kind of crazy minus uh
76:21 - r divided by r times 0.5
76:25 - so this no no
76:29 - if r is the amount of space for all the
76:32 - buttons
76:37 - is it do is it different if it's an odd
76:38 - if it's only going to work if it's an
76:39 - odd number
76:42 - i'm confused give me an odd number of
76:44 - buttons gosh darn it
76:46 - there we go no why are my buttons not
76:49 - centered
76:49 - what did i get wrong here um
76:53 - so the button y location is
76:57 - the center plus
77:00 - what button number i'm on zero times
77:04 - the spacing between all the buttons
77:08 - um and then
77:12 - all right if i do that
77:17 - let's just make for sake of argument now
77:19 - the number of buttons
77:21 - three always so this makes sense
77:25 - i want to be move up by oh
77:28 - it's it's r minus one no no no it's the
77:32 - number of buttons
77:33 - three uh times dr half of that
77:37 - so why shouldn't that be minus
77:40 - r divided by two i went up
77:44 - i went all the divided by four am i just
77:46 - confused
77:48 - yeah it's four
77:52 - i'm not sure why but it definitely is
77:54 - four two
77:59 - so now we have a random number of
78:01 - buttons
78:03 - map would really make sense chris sears
78:07 - is telling me to use map oh my god map
78:10 - would be so
78:11 - would make so much sense here let's redo
78:13 - this with map
78:16 - i like the idea of redoing this with map
78:20 - just as a way to think about it let b y
78:23 - equals map
78:23 - j which goes between 0 and num to
78:27 - between
78:30 - r i want to go between y
78:34 - minus r and y plus r just just for the
78:36 - sake of argument here
78:38 - that's going to space them out
78:44 - how not exactly because
78:48 - if there are two then i'm only getting
78:52 - zero and 1
78:59 - right why did that not work
79:06 - height minus two
79:10 - uh you know why diamond the diameter i
79:13 - know is 2r
79:15 - agree with chris sears wait what's wrong
79:18 - with my mapping
79:20 - um very happy with my mapping um
79:24 - why why is if there's two am i only
79:26 - seeing it
79:28 - one
79:32 - and this is also a good suggestion from
79:35 - i definitely want to add some purl and
79:37 - noisy randomness here
79:38 - and all that kind of stuff but i'm i'm
79:40 - just confused here
79:42 - if j is zero
79:47 - then i'm mapping
79:51 - why would that be in the center
79:55 - zero to two oh i see
79:59 - goes from zero to num minus one yeah
80:03 - yeah yeah yeah yeah okay of course thank
80:05 - you to
80:06 - i'm not really thinking about this
80:08 - because the buttons are zero and one
80:11 - so if no
80:14 - what just happened there
80:22 - oh my mother my other way was working
80:25 - this
80:25 - map not doing what i think it's gonna do
80:29 - um hold on let's just see
80:35 - this should be right with two buttons
80:38 - that's exactly right
80:40 - zero and one with three buttons
80:45 - there once so that's right so
80:48 - if i
80:52 - oh is it just being it's being covered
80:54 - up by this one
80:55 - it's there it's just being covered up
81:04 - yeah they're overlapping
81:08 - i see
81:14 - yeah i think let's use let's use point
81:16 - five there we go okay this
81:18 - of course of course so map actually
81:20 - works
81:21 - uh let's try making them random again
81:26 - but i don't think i think they should
81:29 - actually be
81:30 - like like that's not where you would
81:33 - have two buttons on a snowman
81:35 - i think there's just like an amount of
81:37 - space between the buttons
81:39 - um which makes more sense so
81:42 - it really is y minus uh
81:45 - dr times the total number
81:50 - y
81:53 - like i want a certain amount of length
81:55 - for the buttons to fit into
81:59 - so
82:03 - [Music]
82:08 - this
82:20 - all right i think this is what i want
82:22 - now
82:24 - the buttons are always going to fit in
82:26 - this like
82:28 - small area
82:31 - i have a different idea now i have a
82:33 - different idea everybody
82:35 - okay okay wait wait i think what should
82:37 - be consistent
82:38 - here oh wait we have a donation you
82:40 - saved me
82:41 - you saved me you have the same donation
82:45 - thank you thank you to
82:49 - uh keith a button class oh my god helps
82:56 - eight four nine eight seven
82:59 - two eight seven five nine
83:02 - one nine one seven seven one four seven
83:05 - three three
83:06 - two four five five oh
83:10 - okay i'm not sure why that didn't come
83:14 - through kobe
83:20 - okay um all right boy i'm really
83:24 - this is like a lesson in how to
83:25 - obsessively spend an incredible amount
83:27 - of time
83:28 - on on these buttons how to program a
83:32 - snowman in p5.js
83:34 - in over four and a half hours i have a
83:37 - different idea of a way i want to do
83:38 - this
83:39 - i want the buttons
83:43 - to be um separated right
83:47 - so there's a button size which is r
83:50 - times which is 20 of the radius
83:56 - there is a total number of buttons
84:00 - um and then there is the length
84:05 - of all of the buttons
84:09 - which is the button size times
84:12 - the total number of buttons but
84:16 - um and uh and we should have a little
84:19 - spacing
84:20 - so there should be um
84:26 - but i don't want the spacing to be yeah
84:29 - the spacing
84:32 - to be a percentage
84:37 - oh look at this so complicated um
84:41 - like a 10 a little spacing in between
84:44 - the buttons
84:47 - so i don't need this and now i just need
84:51 - um that the uh
84:55 - the buttons y location goes from 0 to
84:59 - num
84:59 - minus 1 to the
85:03 - center of it minus length divided by 2
85:07 - and then the center plus length divided
85:09 - by 2.
85:10 - there we go so no matter how many
85:13 - buttons there are
85:16 - um the length is
85:20 - i i guess i want them to
85:24 - maybe i want it to be fixed actually the
85:25 - length should actually just be
85:27 - um r times 0.5 i'm gonna do that
85:32 - no that's still the same problem
85:40 - what's happened to me this is really bad
85:44 - i've gone off the deep man i'm going off
85:46 - the deep end
85:47 - top most button should be center aligned
85:49 - with the middle circle and bottom most
85:50 - should be central line with the bottom
85:52 - circle and the rest should be equally
85:54 - spaced in between okay i'm thinking
85:56 - topmost button the buttons go in between
86:00 - here
86:01 - oh i like that idea
86:07 - should we make this okay okay god i got
86:08 - it everybody hold on we're starting over
86:10 - we're starting over cut cut
86:14 - cut
86:15 - [Laughter]
86:19 - cut i have an idea
86:23 - i have an idea people
86:30 - just bear with me for a moment
86:37 - [Music]
87:02 - do
87:07 - throw away daniel
87:22 - everything's going to be okay everybody
87:24 - we're going to refactor this code right
87:26 - now
87:27 - we're going to make it work we're going
87:28 - to sit noon and all i've done
87:30 - is sing a lot of songs and

88:01 - have a message from dorothy
88:02 - um how about in
88:05 - 10 minutes we're gonna take a break in
88:08 - about 10 minutes
88:09 - all right so let's keep going with this
88:18 - um we're going to keep going with this
88:20 - we're going to say r
88:21 - equals
88:25 - this okay when in doubt
88:29 - make everything this dot
88:34 - i have a song that i'm going to sing as
88:35 - soon as i forget that this thought it's
88:37 - going to be very exciting
88:39 - then what am i doing here we i have the
88:42 - same sort of idea
88:48 - and we're going to make the snowball x y
88:52 - with r and then we're going to
88:57 - just want to get what i had before i
88:58 - need to build up some confidence here
89:01 - by making this object oriented
89:04 - um and then uh
89:08 - and then i just need to make the circle
89:13 - with no stroke
89:27 - um okay uh this is looking good people
89:31 - just wait till we have our button class
89:33 - we have our snowball we're gonna be able
89:35 - to
89:35 - animate stuff this is gonna be much
89:37 - better
89:39 - and then now get rid of all this
89:43 - forget about all that stuff just delete
89:45 - it just
89:46 - say goodbye
89:52 - sarah is there more gender-neutral term
89:55 - than snowman i could use
90:12 - let's see here
90:19 - what did i miss people
90:22 - remember how we're going to make this
90:23 - into a holiday card from the coding
90:24 - train
90:26 - uh what did i miss what did i miss i'm
90:28 - getting some errors here
90:31 - line 76
90:39 - [Music]
90:46 - snowball
90:48 - hold on let me look at this r is not
90:50 - defined
90:54 - r is not defined where did i forget r
90:58 - is it what i think it is
91:05 - [Music]
91:11 - i need to do this because i'm going to
91:12 - adjust it i don't know if i'm going to
91:14 - need that later um
91:16 - okay
91:19 - what's still the problem what's still
91:22 - the problem
91:26 - snowballs is not to find line 17 and
91:29 - it's happened everybody it's happened
91:32 - it's happened
91:33 - we have a new song for you to sing guess
91:35 - what everyone
91:36 - it's time to sing another song
91:47 - forgot the this dot
91:50 - it happens a lot
91:53 - my brain starts to rot my attempts at
91:56 - coding were all for naught
91:59 - without this dot you can't create the
92:01 - object
92:02 - this dot deserves but the utmost respect
92:06 - this dot is the one that i can't reject
92:08 - i think
92:09 - i'm falling in love
92:14 - i think i might need the melody
92:18 - forgot the this dot no up there there we
92:21 - go
92:22 - it happens a lot
92:25 - my brain starts to rot my attempts at
92:27 - coding were off or not

94:45 - okay oh i need a break here
94:51 - um so for those of you who are not
94:55 - able to uh donate from your area
94:59 - and you want to donate please go to
95:02 - processingfoundation.org
95:04 - and go to support p5 here hopefully the
95:07 - donorbox system will allow you to donate
95:09 - and you'll also receive the rewards
95:11 - if you're donating through oh the
95:13 - blobbies is
95:14 - the blobbies are watching
95:19 - blobbies um
95:22 - if uh what was i saying um if you are
95:25 - donating via youtube you should
95:29 - make sure you forward your message
95:33 - your email receipt to foundation at
95:35 - processing.org
95:37 - okay let's see if we can add the buttons
95:41 - then i'm going to take a break
95:44 - and um i will
95:49 - um um uh
95:52 - i'm just fixing my hat here i think it
95:54 - looks better like this and i'm gonna let
95:56 - dorothy take over for a few minutes
95:57 - frankly just because i need to break for
95:59 - a second
96:00 - but i wanna i want to accomplish the
96:02 - buttons
96:04 - i cannot i can make the buttons happen
96:08 - okay where
96:12 - so now we want to add some buttons so
96:14 - let's make a
96:16 - button class so honestly the button
96:22 - can basically be the snowball
96:26 - um cannot access snowball before
96:29 - initialization that's interesting
96:30 - because i'm doing something kind of
96:32 - crazy here where i've
96:33 - got everything in one file that's fine
96:35 - so if you this is a little this is
96:37 - quite unnecessary but if you've never
96:40 - tried
96:40 - inheritance before with object-oriented
96:42 - programming here is a nice
96:43 - opportunity so i can basically say
96:47 - how do i do this again i think if i
96:50 - write the constructor
96:52 - and then call super basically the idea
96:55 - of creating a button
96:56 - is to give it an x y and a size
97:00 - and the only difference is
97:04 - and i can say um
97:07 - let's make this a color this dot color
97:15 - so the snowball is a circle that is
97:19 - white and the button is everything that
97:22 - is a snowball
97:23 - but just has a color that is zero
97:29 - yes i'm going full classes people
97:32 - i'm going full object-oriented
97:34 - programming
97:36 - this is my i'm going full update
97:38 - programming expression
97:44 - forgot this dot all right now
97:47 - i should be able to
97:50 - just make some buttons now
97:54 - i should be able to say okay because
97:56 - i've got two snowballs i'm going to say
98:00 - start you is snowballs
98:04 - index is the bottom one is number two
98:07 - is the middle one dot y
98:12 - end y is the
98:17 - middle one y and then
98:21 - i just want to
98:25 - i want to have some number of buttons
98:32 - uh we have a lot of buttons people
98:37 - we have between 10 and 20 buttons so
98:40 - we're going to have that many buttons
98:45 - and the um
98:52 - and i'm going to say buttons index
98:55 - i equals a new button at an
98:59 - x and a y so the
99:03 - the button the y the x is still just at
99:05 - this x
99:08 - the y
99:12 - the the y is mapping
99:15 - uh i which goes between 0 and num minus
99:18 - 1 from start
99:19 - y to end y and the
99:22 - size of the buttons are this
99:26 - dot r times ten so ten percent
99:29 - of the radius what have i done
99:32 - oh wait we have a donation
99:36 - anonymous anonymous has donated thank
99:40 - you very much
99:40 - [Music]
99:47 - six eight nine zero six nine
99:50 - zero four eight five nine five
99:54 - eight seven six two zero six eight seven
99:57 - three two five
99:58 - six all right thank you anonymous all
100:00 - right
100:01 - okay now uh
100:04 - what's wrong with my code here error
100:08 - line 86
100:14 - i don't have a line 86
100:18 - what's going on what's happening
100:23 - what have i done wrong
100:36 - are you hearing that by the way this
100:37 - sort of like noise
100:42 - just try something no i don't know what
100:44 - that is um
100:45 - okay let
100:48 - button extends snowball
100:54 - i made the most complicated snowman ever
101:01 - but i'm completely lost as to what the
101:03 - error is i'm going to look over here
101:09 - snowballs is not defined oh my god
101:14 - no are you serious
101:20 - [Music]
101:29 - forgot this dot
101:32 - it happens a lot
101:35 - forgot the this dot
101:37 - [Music]
101:38 - my brain is
101:51 - cannot read property one of undefined
101:55 - snozeballs there we go
102:00 - woohoo i'm back we're back baby
102:07 - the most over engineered snowman ever
102:10 - it's going to be worth it though
102:17 - where are the buttons where are the
102:20 - buttons people
102:36 - where are the buttons
102:43 - okay so let's let's
102:46 - not show these for a second
102:50 - all right now are we getting to here
102:56 - oh this dot buttons is not iterable
103:00 - line 29
103:04 - oh this dot buttons
103:10 - [Music]
103:27 - buttons
103:28 - [Music]
103:32 - i'm falling in love with the studs
103:38 - [Music]
103:40 - buttons
103:41 - [Laughter]
103:44 - oh my god those are the buttons maybe
103:47 - it's too many buttons
103:48 - dorothy save me
103:51 - okay oh god
104:01 - that's what is
104:16 - okay we're getting somewhere
104:20 - i think we should have them overlap even
104:22 - more by the way
104:23 - yeah there we go okay
104:32 - snowman i have no
104:35 - talent for visual design whatsoever okay
104:38 - so um that's a lot of buttons i agree
104:42 - i agree i think i might rethink this a
104:45 - little bit but it's flexible now
104:47 - um all right we're gonna take a short
104:50 - break not really a break but i would
104:52 - like to bring in dorothy here
104:54 - to um to talk about
104:58 - uh the processing foundation so let me
105:00 - move to
105:01 - this here and i'm gonna just play
105:04 - the processing fundraiser theme song
105:06 - while i get set up to bring dorothy in
105:19 - [Music]
105:27 - yeah we've come a long way in the year
105:30 - of 2020 though
105:32 - a lot of things happened that weren't so
105:36 - funny sure we had a lot of whoops
105:39 - but we did a lot of coding and the
105:42 - processing foundation lets us keep the
105:45 - engine going on the coding train
105:50 - it comes along and then it takes you
105:52 - away
105:54 - into a world where all that
105:59 - [Music]
106:01 - and the passengers on board that keep
106:04 - the train running at its best

108:40 - or snow pal i've been seeing some some
108:43 - interesting names for the snow friend
108:47 - that you've lovely um
108:51 - i i thought the cold buttons would go in
108:53 - the middle circle personally
108:55 - with a nose and two coal like
108:58 - coal eyes but you know i don't want to
109:00 - add any more work to anyone
109:02 - um you know
109:05 - that would certainly make sense i don't
109:07 - know what what's happening to me today
109:09 - i'm like uh
109:10 - it's just been i think it's been a very
109:12 - long 2020
109:14 - and all of a sudden like what seemed to
109:16 - me like the simplest thing in the world
109:17 - that i would not possibly need to
109:19 - prepare for
109:20 - in terms of like programming a little
109:21 - snowman design uh
109:23 - has turned into a quite oh snow pal
109:26 - i love snow pal i'm going to use that
109:28 - snow power
109:30 - that's a good one um i've i've really
109:34 - it's
109:34 - a you know i guess it's an example of
109:36 - what of
109:37 - of the process of what coding is like
109:41 - yeah no i mean i mean i guess and i
109:43 - don't want to take up much more time i
109:45 - know people
109:46 - logged on to see you dan so hey and

110:42 - it like really does keep the work going
110:45 - um but yeah donating enables us to kind
110:49 - of
110:49 - do all of the programming that we have

110:53 - fellowship
110:54 - open calls is coming up next year so
110:57 - please be on the lookout for that that's
110:58 - a way to kind of work with the
110:59 - processing foundation and other

112:51 - incredible team we have i think
112:52 - a lot of what you see what everyone sees
112:54 - happening whether it's the coding train
112:57 - whether it's um you know uh p5
113:01 - dot js community you know handling you
113:04 - know
113:04 - um inquiries or kind of questions on our
113:08 - discourse forum
113:09 - and um you know from all the processing
113:12 - foundation
113:13 - or crosstalk community day organizers
113:16 - around the world like it takes
113:18 - so much to do the things that we do and
113:20 - so i
113:21 - again just wanted to thank everyone and
113:23 - if you have any questions
113:24 - again foundation at processing.org uh as
113:27 - dan mentioned please don't forget to
113:29 - send your receipt to
113:31 - foundationnetprocessing.org i'm actually
113:33 - going through all that email
113:34 - so um i will be um
113:37 - and then this time also i have to admit
113:40 - the um
113:41 - uh my apartment is not is no longer
113:43 - going to be the fulfillment center so
113:45 - you should be able to get things
113:48 - way faster this year
113:53 - but um yeah dan is there anything that
113:56 - you want me to
113:57 - um talk specifically about or no i'm
114:00 - just i was you were talking i was kind
114:02 - of like scrolling through various pages
114:04 - of the website
114:05 - um like to see and it's just like so
114:07 - wonderful it makes me smile to see all
114:09 - the
114:09 - faces and names of people who are on the
114:11 - people page of the processing foundation
114:13 - and that really only i think you know
114:14 - scratches the surface of all the
114:16 - different people that have been involved
114:18 - um if you go to the fellowships page and
114:20 - scroll through to see all the previous
114:22 - fellows projects
114:23 - another thing that i think is really
114:24 - important to highlight is the processing
114:26 - foundation medium
114:28 - where um there'll be long form posts
114:30 - from different fellowship projects and
114:32 - especially um
114:33 - um the the i can highlight i would like
114:34 - to highlight these create canvas
114:36 - interviews which are interviews with the
114:38 - um different
114:39 - educators um that's sort of been like a
114:42 - new thing that um
114:43 - a lot of new episodes of that came
114:45 - trying to think of what are the
114:45 - highlights of 2020
114:47 - so i guess i don't even really have to
114:49 - think of them because if you just go to
114:50 - the medium page and scroll through
114:51 - you're really going to see
114:53 - all the posts over that um that
114:55 - particular year
114:57 - i mean i think another highlight that i
114:59 - want to share and
115:00 - we get so many emails i and again just
115:02 - to a test i ca i
115:04 - i go through all these emails um
115:07 - that i that are always asking how you
115:09 - can help and i think a big part of it is
115:12 - to you know using the forum
115:15 - uh posting your questions sharing your
115:17 - artwork sharing your artwork tagging us
115:19 - on social media so we know what you're
115:21 - making the things that you're doing
115:23 - i mean there's so many ways to to kind
115:26 - of celebrate
115:27 - you know all the things that we've done
115:28 - this year and this has been a really
115:29 - difficult year and i think um
115:31 - to dan's point considering that
115:35 - what the fellows of 2020 had to go
115:37 - through i really encourage you to look
115:38 - at the medium
115:40 - interviews that they've uh done with uh
115:42 - joanna hedwa our
115:43 - director of advocacy and as dan
115:46 - mentioned
115:47 - um listening in on the interviews that
115:50 - uh
115:50 - sauber khan our education community
115:52 - director conducted with
115:53 - educators from you know different kind
115:56 - of areas as well
115:57 - uh using code as a way of making artwork
116:00 - but also
116:02 - just trying to you know uh
116:05 - engage in social change and um
116:08 - yeah and this this year definitely we
116:10 - need to celebrate all of those
116:12 - accomplishments from the fellows to our
116:14 - team even to all of you to the community
116:17 - and to the contributors out there um
116:19 - there's so many there's so many of you
116:22 - and it's just it's like i i really am so
116:24 - thankful to be a part of this community
116:27 - um
116:28 - because i'm learning so so much also
116:30 - just side note dan
116:32 - i've said this previously i i would love
116:35 - an iteration
116:36 - of the coding train sweater for next
116:39 - year
116:40 - i know if i know people would totally
116:43 - like love that just
116:45 - you know just a side note yes i would
116:47 - love to make that happen i should get in
116:49 - touch with mariko who
116:50 - this was like a one-time thing i should
116:52 - pull up her twitter
116:53 - but she made a whole video about her
116:55 - process and like hand making and
116:56 - designing the sweater
116:58 - like um then this was i think from now
117:00 - two or three years ago and it's like i
117:02 - just wear it every year now
117:03 - but th this is why i was saying this
117:05 - over email what happens to me with this
117:07 - holiday fundraiser is it's
117:09 - always such a busy fall is so busy and
117:11 - so stressed so many things going on
117:13 - this is such a joy and fun to do but i
117:15 - literally like to start figuring out
117:16 - what i'm going to do
117:17 - the day before so one of these years i
117:20 - got to start planning this much further
117:22 - in advance we can have sweaters for
117:24 - everybody
117:25 - more guests uh more coding examples and
117:28 - fun things we're gonna have to remember
117:29 - that so somebody
117:30 - i don't know maybe someone remind me
117:32 - around october next year or when is it
117:34 - thanksgiving that's when i should be
117:35 - like that's when the christmas seat the
117:37 - holiday season starts i don't know
117:39 - but yes the sweater we got to make the
117:40 - sweater a thing i'm into that
117:42 - well you know you know in the
117:44 - philippines christmas
117:46 - decorations go up in september oh
117:51 - so i mean it's it starts
117:54 - early so we will figure it out we'll
117:56 - figure it out
117:58 - um but yeah dan thank you so much for
118:01 - doing the telethon every year and just
118:04 - all of the fun
118:05 - i mean i don't know what did you did you
118:07 - make a snowman last year i don't
118:08 - remember i did log on
118:10 - but i don't even you've done so many
118:12 - videos i don't even remember it's hard
118:14 - it's hard to remember because um i've
118:17 - kind of gone through like all of the
118:18 - obvious
118:19 - like holiday things like oh let's do a
118:21 - snowflake or let's do a
118:23 - tree fractal tree but i don't think snow
118:26 - i think there was
118:27 - uh one year where i did this like i was
118:29 - like playing with sketch rnn which is
118:30 - this machine learning model that would
118:32 - generate drawings
118:33 - i think some snowmen might have come out
118:34 - of that but uh no this is the first
118:37 - p5.js
118:37 - snow pal or snow buddy that um
118:41 - for uh for for the telesign so i'm gonna
118:43 - i'm gonna i'm gonna make that happen
118:44 - so one last question for you dorothy
118:46 - before we sign off is
118:49 - if people are sharing um anything they
118:52 - make
118:54 - regardless whether it's from but i'm
118:55 - thinking in particular of anybody who's
118:57 - watching this live stream and is going
118:59 - to take that snow but snow pal code and
119:01 - make a much
119:02 - more real like beautifully designed
119:05 - version of a snow pal
119:07 - um how should they share it with the
119:09 - processing foundation
119:11 - on twitter just tag processing org
119:13 - what's the best way
119:15 - yeah tagging processing org on twitter
119:18 - or
119:18 - instagram um if you have an app
119:21 - you know it's interesting we get a lot
119:23 - of animated work
119:24 - and it's unless someone uh posts
119:28 - kind of you know a story on say
119:30 - instagram
119:32 - but the best way is also to if you
119:34 - wanted to submit to foundation at
119:35 - processing.org like an actual
119:37 - you know excerpt of an animation that
119:39 - you have i'm i can do that as well
119:41 - it's easier for me to to then share the
119:44 - animation because i know sometimes
119:46 - you know on on you know the different
119:48 - social media streams you can only share
119:50 - kind of an um like a screenshot or an
119:53 - actual image
119:54 - if it's reposted or reshared so um
119:58 - yeah that's awesome can share
120:01 - okay well we're gonna be collecting a
120:03 - lot of these in the coding train discord
120:05 - i know that there's a system and
120:06 - we've got like a holiday submissions
120:08 - channel i'm gonna try to pull that up
120:09 - and see but so
120:10 - so we'll collect we'll i'll help we'll
120:12 - sort of collect stuff and we can share
120:13 - throughout the next few days for the
120:16 - rest of 2020 share everybody's
120:18 - um holiday or new year's themed uh p5.js
120:21 - cards i would love that oh yes i saw
120:25 - that earlier and i was so excited i
120:27 - actually want to make a p5
120:30 - holiday card yeah please do that and um

120:42 - uh a big kind of applause for dorothy
120:44 - and
120:45 - uh oh thank you for all of your work on
120:47 - the processing foundation
120:48 - here's to another wonderful year of
120:51 - processing community
120:52 - projects and initiatives and
120:54 - get-togethers and code and fun and all
120:57 - sorts of stuff
120:58 - in 2021 thank you
121:02 - everyone bye bye dorothy okay
121:10 - all right i'm back this is go i would

121:17 - dorothy i'm just thinking about
121:18 - how i'm doing with this live stream
121:20 - today it's 12 30 we've been going
121:22 - for about two hours we had so many
121:24 - donations come in
121:26 - um but i uh so i'm not sure how to like

123:27 - right now because i just copy pasted it
123:29 - over
123:31 - stig writes don't sweat about the snow
123:33 - buddy dan
123:35 - showing what an inherently messy
123:37 - activity coding is will help people just
123:39 - learning
123:39 - to code overcome their anxiety of having
123:41 - to make everything perfect
123:43 - thank you for expressing what is the
123:45 - mantra
123:46 - the point of view the philosophy of the
123:49 - coding train
123:51 - itself um i super super appreciate it
123:55 - and for all of you who are tagging me
123:56 - right now at discord know that a big
123:58 - sound effect goes off in my ear every
124:00 - time i get tagged so try to use that
124:02 - only
124:03 - for any sort of like important messages
124:04 - that i need to receive
124:06 - uh so thank you uh stig for that comment
124:09 - and for your support of the coding
124:11 - terrain and the processing foundation
124:13 - um all right so what i what i want to do
124:15 - is i want to quickly go and show you
124:17 - um so this is a this telethon
124:21 - is a fundraiser for the processing
124:24 - foundation you just heard from dorothy
124:26 - uh and i've been talking about the
124:27 - processing foundation thank you
124:28 - everyone's donated i hear we've reached
124:30 - our goal
124:30 - let's see if we can get it higher still
124:33 - people are still donating i'll probably
124:34 - still be here live streaming although i
124:35 - really need to go spend some time with
124:36 - my children
124:38 - um and um but what i wanted to mention
124:42 - is simultaneously
124:43 - sort of as part of creating all of these
124:47 - p5.js holiday cards that i'm doing as
124:49 - part of the telethon
124:50 - we are running in the coding train
124:52 - discord a kind of holiday giveaway
124:54 - so you can um in the announcement
124:56 - section you can find some more
124:57 - information on it i just wanted to show
124:59 - this is where i will be collect this is
125:01 - where you can post
125:03 - your uh holiday sketches so a diamond
125:06 - ore i hope
125:07 - it's okay with you that i'm showing your
125:08 - sketch it is so
125:10 - uh fantastic i just looked at it um this
125:12 - is the first
125:13 - submission using the um
125:17 - card template made by konsti so you can
125:19 - see the template
125:21 - is just has a title username
125:24 - uh click the mouse and the card opens is
125:27 - it the clicking the mouse that actually
125:29 - causes the card to open i actually have
125:31 - no idea
125:32 - and let's take a look now at this uh
125:35 - this
125:36 - example from uh the diamond ore on
125:39 - discord
125:39 - bounding polygon by or yeti oh look at
125:42 - this
125:43 - it's a card with this animation isn't
125:45 - that so cool
125:46 - look there's even a slider here so i can
125:49 - kind of
125:50 - uh i don't know what the slider does but
125:52 - it does something cool
125:53 - changes the force the boundaries and i
125:56 - can do toggle
125:57 - so there's a polygon here that i can
125:58 - toggle on and off i love this so i love
126:01 - this idea
126:02 - of holiday cards with p5.js animations
126:05 - let's collect these
126:06 - um maybe like making short like gif
126:08 - animations of them and sharing them on
126:10 - social media
126:11 - i'm in the market for a really good
126:13 - hashtag or that you could just tag the
126:15 - coding train and processing.org
126:17 - i'd love to be able to but i think a
126:18 - hashtag is useful because then i can
126:20 - just go to that page
126:21 - and see all of them so uh i'm looking
126:24 - for your
126:24 - hashtag uh um
126:28 - submissions now for how we're going to
126:29 - share this back to
126:31 - my snow pal
126:35 - okay so first of all i'm gonna i did
126:38 - like snow buddy
126:39 - but i'm gonna change this to snow pal
126:41 - just because it is a
126:43 - less typing and i don't know why i put a
126:46 - capital b
126:46 - there that seems unnecessary um
126:50 - and this will be whoops what did i just
126:53 - do here
126:55 - so this is a new snow pal this is my pal
127:00 - pal
127:03 - what did i do wrong
127:07 - oh right and then i made that because
127:10 - i had to be crazy about this
127:13 - um there's an
127:17 - error due to snowball
127:21 - it's no pals no pal
127:25 - oh no that's snope that's still snowball
127:27 - oh my god i've lost my mind
127:30 - what's going on
127:36 - i've ruined everything
127:42 - snowball's not defined
127:45 - ah there we go there we go there we go
127:48 - okay we're back people we're back
127:50 - here is our snow pal all right so
127:54 - the buttons are flawed but i'm gonna
127:56 - move on
127:58 - from the buttons and now we just need to
128:02 - probably um
128:05 - put in a nose
128:11 - let's see if um
128:14 - let's just make the note let's just have
128:17 - the nose be a vector
128:19 - like a vector object with a position
128:22 - and i think probably
128:23 - [Music]
128:26 - if i just take
128:30 - and put a rectangle there
128:34 - and say fill
128:39 - where is my oh this dot nose
128:46 - let's quickly add a nose
128:56 - yay there's my nose uh why is the y
129:00 - oh because the y went up um
129:03 - all right so let's just say
129:06 - uh if i've really done this in like such
129:10 - an insane way
129:14 - uh if
129:19 - let's see the nose is
129:26 - let's put it in the middle
129:30 - of the last snowball
129:45 - zero one two
129:49 - this dot this dot
129:52 - it's so quiet there we go okay
129:56 - there's my there's my three to six i'm
130:00 - saying i'm being told to use
130:01 - fewer buttons
130:05 - okay that's starting to look good
130:11 - okay now the nose should really be a
130:14 - triangle
130:16 - so let's make it a triangle
130:22 - so how do i make a triangle triangle
130:25 - this knows x knows y
130:29 - this nose dot x this
130:32 - knows dot y i'm just gonna hard code in
130:35 - some numbers like
130:36 - one point down and then
130:39 - i need one more
130:43 - let's uh so i need x and y y
130:46 - down then x plus like 20.
130:49 - and let's go back to the right this is
130:52 - what oh that's pretty good like see
130:53 - that's what i'm kind of going for with
130:55 - the nose
130:56 - maybe it should actually be pointing
130:58 - down yeah that's better maybe so
131:00 - it should obviously be bigger so no
131:03 - um i need like nose width
131:08 - is this dot r
131:12 - um this dot r times
131:16 - uh 20 percent
131:23 - okay that's though that's the height
131:30 - interesting um
131:36 - and
131:38 - notice how i didn't make a nose class
131:40 - even though i really showed up
131:41 - based on what i'm doing let's just make
131:43 - it uh
131:44 - the height 10 percent
131:49 - there we go that's pretty good for my
131:52 - nose
131:53 - i'll take it
131:56 - sort of sizing according to
132:02 - the uh the snow pal now we need some
132:06 - eyes
132:09 - um what should i do about the eyes
132:11 - buttons
132:15 - should i get a little image of buttons
132:16 - we're just gonna we're just gonna put
132:18 - two
132:18 - more circles i gotta wrap this up people
132:22 - uh okay so that's my uh nose
132:30 - now and i think actually i for right now
132:32 - i would like the um
132:37 - our snow pal to generally be larger so i
132:39 - don't want to have a super small one
132:41 - okay
132:42 - um now let's see um
132:49 - all right so we make it orange orange
132:52 - that's a good idea the
132:54 - the could someone give me could i please
132:57 - request
132:57 - an rgb value
133:00 - from orange oh try the color 255 140
133:04 - comma zero
133:05 - okay let's try that for the nose
133:08 - um 255 140.
133:13 - ah that's better i like that thank you
133:16 - um okay we're doing well
133:20 - 93 57 13 i'm also being told
133:26 - um 93 57
133:29 - 13 let's try that 93
133:32 - 57 13.
133:40 - that's too dark but i thank you for this
134:53 - oh my sound is off sorry everybody
134:57 - that's when you're supposed to use the
134:58 - notification
134:59 - right that's when you add shiffman me
135:00 - when my sound is off
135:04 - yeah yeah i'm gonna wait for the chat to
135:06 - catch up with me having realized that i
135:08 - i hit the mute button by accident
135:11 - but look at this look at our beautiful
135:14 - buttons all
135:17 - this shape and mis-sized oh i love mars
135:19 - snow pal
135:21 - i love our snow pal okay chat come on
135:26 - catch up catch up chat catch up to where
135:27 - i fixed it
135:29 - okay um now let's see what they need
135:32 - some eyes
135:33 - i'm really getting tired of doing this
135:38 - um okay
135:42 - it's back it's back it's back you gonna
135:46 - hear me right
135:48 - okay um
135:51 - what what do
135:55 - snow men look like
135:58 - oh ooh look at this a scarf
136:02 - well that's so much oh i need little a
136:04 - little mouth a little okay we're gonna
136:06 - have to do this
136:08 - we got to go through with this everybody
136:09 - all right so
136:11 - i think the buttons i can use reuse the
136:14 - button class for the eyes and the mouth
136:16 - let's do that
136:18 - so oh i have an idea let's have the snow
136:22 - pal sing along with me oh this is gonna
136:24 - be fun okay i've got an idea everybody
136:27 - this is great uh okay so now i just need
136:31 - to let's add some eyes
136:37 - let's say
136:40 - the left eye is a new button
136:44 - um where am i let's see i want this is
136:46 - the top
136:47 - snowball xy so let me this is the head
136:56 - so let's just put that in a variable so
136:58 - i can say head dot x
137:01 - head dot y so now i have
137:04 - the head and the left eye is
137:07 - head dot x
137:12 - minus let's just ahead dot r
137:23 - uh here head um
137:26 - okay so we're going to make a head a
137:28 - head as a button
137:30 - at x minus the rate half of the radius
137:33 - and then at um
137:38 - head dot y sorry
137:43 - and a right eye which will be
137:47 - uh plus that and then we can say this
137:50 - dot buttons
137:51 - push
137:54 - push those two eyes in
137:57 - no oh i need an r for them um i need a
138:01 - size let's just quickly
138:02 - type hard code in a value
138:06 - look at those eyes they're beautiful
138:12 - i guess they should be also and that's
138:15 - too
138:16 - too far apart those eyes are okay that's
138:19 - a little bit better
138:21 - their size should probably be
138:27 - that's pretty good 10 of the radius
138:32 - and then their y should be also
138:40 - offset uh
138:47 - okay yay
138:52 - okay now we've got our eyes
139:00 - now for the really exciting moment this
139:03 - is going to be so
139:04 - fun let's make a little sine wave for
139:07 - the mouth
139:11 - so i've really done
139:14 - quite a number on the code here
139:17 - i just want to be able to see this
139:21 - see these variables i don't usually do
139:24 - this
139:25 - but i want to be able to see this
139:28 - written out so i left and i
139:30 - right those are the left eye and right
139:32 - eye now one thing that
139:34 - i'm kind of got all over the place here
139:36 - let's put this into a variable is offset
139:45 - because that i think would be useful
139:48 - to just have in a variable
139:53 - and then also
139:56 - let's make a
140:01 - a head r which is
140:04 - head dot r times 0.1
140:07 - so this is for the buttons in the head
140:11 - okay so now we're still in pretty good
140:13 - shape here try using an
140:15 - arc well i could use an art but i want
140:16 - to put the dots
140:18 - an arc right right right an arc it
140:20 - doesn't need to be a sine wave yes
140:21 - that's sort of silly
140:22 - i was thinking of actually having its
140:24 - mouth oscillate as a sine wave
140:26 - as because i'm going to make the snow
140:28 - pal sing
140:30 - this is this is going somewhere people
140:32 - it's going places it's going to snow
140:35 - i got to make the fractal tree hands oh
140:38 - it's okay
140:39 - we're getting there it's only 12 50.
140:42 - okay how are we doing donation we
140:43 - haven't had a donation in a little while
140:45 - i got to keep me going here
140:46 - gotta gotta gotta fuel the train i have
140:48 - a little bit more
140:49 - coffee that's quite cold here
140:55 - i hear the pitter-patter of children's
140:58 - feet
141:00 - alright so now we've got to do
141:04 - a loop hello
141:09 - i do okay i gotta finish this i'm making
141:12 - a snow
141:14 - pal
141:18 - but i will i'm gonna wrap up soon but
141:21 - i've gotta make this snow pal
141:26 - [Music]
141:52 - something
141:55 - go away daniel
142:02 - okay now what i'm attempting to do is
142:05 - use
142:06 - polar to cartesian coordinates
142:09 - to trace the path of the mouth
142:12 - in a little bit of an arc so i'm going
142:13 - from the angle 0 to 180 degrees let's
142:16 - see if that works
142:18 - so and i have my ridiculous um
142:22 - way of making a an eye so that i should
142:24 - be able to say
142:25 - this dot buttons all right
142:29 - let's just let's make a let's make a
142:31 - mouth button
142:33 - there's a new button that goes at x y
142:36 - with some i'm just going to hard code in
142:38 - a size
142:40 - and this dot buttons push
142:43 - um mouth so oh they're all up here look
142:47 - at that
142:48 - there they are up there so i need to
142:50 - offset them by
142:52 - uh head.x
142:56 - head dot y
143:00 - there see look at that so
143:05 - and offset needs to be
143:09 - times two i think spread it out more
143:14 - um there this is what i'm talking about
143:22 - [Laughter]
143:24 - looking good so
143:28 - the question is so i should use map
143:31 - i think like i probably want to have a
143:35 - fixed number of these and then i'll map
143:36 - the angle
143:37 - so let's just say this is how many is
143:39 - this one two three four
143:41 - five six seven let's say we have eight
143:44 - so let's try doing it um
143:47 - for let n equal zero n is less than
143:50 - eight and
143:50 - plus plus
143:54 - and then um instead of this
143:57 - let's let the angle be
144:00 - map n which goes from 0 to 8 0 to pi
144:05 - and this should say angle
144:10 - and what did i get wrong here now
144:14 - what did i mess up here
144:18 - n which goes from zero to eight zero to
144:20 - pi what's different
144:21 - what did i do oh i have an extra like
144:24 - curly
144:25 - there we go so it's off by one
144:28 - because it should this should actually
144:31 - be
144:31 - seven there we go
144:35 - um i but maybe i actually shouldn't go
144:39 - all the way to the side
144:41 - i don't know how to use half of cosine
144:43 - and sine it should
144:44 - look more natural yes
144:48 - 0 to 120 with 30 degree offset oh
144:51 - interesting
144:52 - so i could go from you know 0.1 to pi
144:55 - i'm just doing like arbitrary values
144:57 - here um
145:01 - and then this should be
145:04 - head r
145:10 - but it should be a little bit smaller
145:15 - that's pretty good um all right
145:18 - i think the nose should be a little bit
145:23 - i don't higher what i'm doing here okay
145:26 - oh
145:26 - oh boy the nose is cutting off the mouth
145:28 - okay i think we're in pretty good shape
145:30 - here
145:31 - this could this could this could use
145:33 - some work but um it's fine
145:35 - i also just feel like generally um
145:41 - can i get away with a 200 what
145:45 - is 200 like off the yeah 200 is way off
145:49 - 150 is the maximum right
145:52 - no
145:58 - i don't know what i'm doing here let's
145:59 - let's
146:01 - let's try this okay i'm not going to get
146:03 - too caught up in that all right
146:05 - here is our oh we need to offset all of
146:07 - these
146:08 - they should also like and it's too bad
146:10 - that the nose is like cutting off the
146:11 - last one there
146:13 - but um i'll live with that we should
146:15 - offset
146:16 - we should we should adjust these all
146:18 - with a little bit of randomness
146:19 - i like that as well you know what it
146:21 - should be the buttons
146:25 - where did i make it should hear the
146:27 - button itself
146:28 - should give itself its own little bit of
146:32 - randomness
146:35 - right so rather than whoa
146:39 - uh rather than rather than me have to
146:42 - figure it out for every single one
146:44 - since i have this button class there's
146:47 - no reason
146:48 - why wherever it might be where is the
146:50 - button class
146:51 - do i have a button class snowball button
146:55 - yes
146:57 - there's no reason why i can't say
146:59 - something like x plus equal
147:01 - random like let's give them all a little
147:04 - bit of offset
147:06 - every single button and probably the
147:09 - amount of offset should be based on
147:10 - something
147:11 - and then the size
147:17 - but like a 10 percent adjustment
147:20 - whoa that sees like that offset is like
147:23 - crazy for the mouse now
147:25 - mouth so probably
147:28 - the randomness of x should be
147:32 - some uh
147:36 - some amount of r itself
147:40 - so let's just see
147:45 - right so that makes sense because
147:50 - like they're much more off for
147:53 - the larger buttons so now
147:56 - okay this is going well here is
147:59 - our snowman yay okay
148:03 - i'm excited has no hands everybody's
148:05 - telling me it has no hands
148:06 - it's going to have hands make the nose a
148:09 - little bit smaller
148:10 - i really the the nose is kind of awful i
148:12 - need to do something about this nose
148:15 - but i'm going to leave it right now you
148:17 - know this is code that all of you can
148:18 - improve and make better
148:20 - all right let's add the arms
148:25 - so all i need
148:32 - is
148:36 - a fractal tree
148:40 - oh how convenient look at this fractal
148:43 - tree
148:43 - and if i go over here and i run this
148:47 - looks pretty good probably something
148:50 - like
148:50 - this would be a nice arm and we can make
148:53 - it have a little bit more randomness to
148:54 - it
148:55 - let's grab this code let's get this
148:58 - branch function
149:02 - whoops let's get this branch function go
149:04 - back over to
149:06 - our and
149:09 - we're going to say give it a constructor
149:12 - gets just a starting point and maybe a
149:14 - starting angle
149:17 - and so this dot x equals x this dot y
149:20 - equals y
149:21 - this dot angle equals angle and then
149:24 - let's write a branch function
149:28 - and oops
149:31 - so whoops
149:36 - oh it should have an initial length
149:43 - and then the show function
149:46 - will recursively
149:49 - branch with its length
150:00 - okay now um
150:04 - okay there's lots of interesting things
150:06 - going in the chat but let's let's see so
150:08 - so what's i've got some syntax errors
150:10 - first of all too many brackets maybe
150:14 - okay so now
150:18 - this branch first i'm going to need a
150:20 - push
150:22 - and i'm going to need a pop because all
150:23 - that translation and rotation
150:25 - is going to need to be self-contained
150:28 - then i'm going to want to translate to
150:31 - the x and y and rotate by
150:34 - that angle to start and then
150:38 - call branch so let's see if we can make
150:41 - a arm
150:48 - so let's add we've got head and buttons
150:50 - and mouth and nose
150:53 - let's add a
150:56 - left arm there's a new arm
151:00 - at i'm just going to give it some
151:02 - arbitrary location for right now
151:05 - negative 100 uh 200 wait what am i doing
151:09 - i don't know where are we i should
151:11 - translate to like the center let's
151:13 - let's just try 100 uh 300
151:16 - and length of 100 um and let's say
151:21 - this dot left arm dot show
151:26 - okay so we've got some errors what went
151:29 - wrong boy a lot of like helpful error
151:31 - messages for me here but
151:32 - it's too much call from line two one
151:34 - nine and draw
151:36 - um
151:39 - i think something has gone has gone
151:41 - wrong here something has gone terribly
151:43 - wrong
151:44 - um uh so i i think my snow pal has to go
151:48 - into a different file
151:50 - i i've suffi i've completely
151:54 - um we need some more javascript files
151:56 - here
151:57 - snowpal.js i can't follow this anymore
152:02 - and
152:07 - snowpal.js let's make one more
152:10 - call just parts parts.js
152:16 - parts.js
152:21 - and in parts
152:24 - i will take the arm
152:29 - the snowball and the button
152:34 - um and put that in here
152:39 - so this is helping me understand what's
152:41 - going on uh
152:43 - this should say pal all right we are
152:45 - back but what is this error that i'm
152:47 - getting
152:48 - uncaught angle is not defined
152:53 - i have a feeling it's this
152:55 - [Music]
153:00 - forgot the this dot
153:03 - it happens a lot
153:06 - my brain starts to rot my attempts at
153:09 - coding were all or not
153:12 - without this dot you can't create the
153:14 - object
153:15 - this dot deserves but the utmost respect
153:19 - this dot is the one that i can't reject
153:22 - i think i'm falling in love
153:42 - [Music]
153:46 - oh
153:50 - [Music]
154:00 - branch is not defined ah this dot
154:14 - branches
154:21 - rotate was expecting a number
154:22 - [Music]
154:26 - the confusing thing is there's too many
154:29 - okay
154:32 - oh oh i didn't give it an angle okay
154:35 - hold on
154:38 - i see i see what's going on where's my
154:41 - snow pal
154:43 - i need to give it the constructor gets
154:48 - x y length and then angle the angle is
154:50 - not important right now i just thought i
154:52 - might need a starting angle
154:54 - and now parts
154:58 - um stroke
155:02 - zero there we go
155:07 - the arm is there okay so the reason why
155:09 - i did this
155:11 - is because i was imagining that
155:15 - here when i'm creating the arm
155:21 - i'm creating the arm
155:25 - that first of all that's much too large
155:28 - then i could give it an angle to like
155:32 - point it in a given direction there we
155:34 - go
155:36 - that's a starting angle and then now its
155:39 - position
155:40 - should be
155:46 - we'll call it body equals
155:49 - it's the second snowball
155:52 - so its position should be um
155:58 - arm x is body
156:01 - dot x minus body dot
156:06 - r and that should be arm
156:08 - x and arm y
156:12 - should just be body dot dot y
156:16 - right there it is and then the
156:19 - angle should be more like
156:23 - this and it should also go further in
156:26 - like it gets stuck in so body y
156:30 - minus so arm y is body
156:34 - dot y um no no x this is still x
156:38 - uh times times 1.2
156:43 - no oh my well times 0.8
156:48 - there we go okay there's the tree now
156:52 - i want to do some more stuff with this
156:55 - actual tree
156:56 - um which is and i think i'm gonna i
157:00 - gotta slow down a little bit here
157:02 - because there's an infinite amount of
157:04 - stuff i could do but
157:05 - i would like to sort of see what happens
157:07 - if i give it
157:09 - a stroke weight of two just to make it a
157:11 - little bit thicker
157:13 - okay there we go
157:17 - and um
157:21 - this angle i would like it to be
157:24 - slightly random
157:33 - yeah so this is good i guess it could be
157:36 - broadened
157:38 - there we go
157:44 - there we go so we can see giving that a
157:47 - little bit of randomness i mean i could
157:48 - really do more with varying the tree
157:50 - um i should probably give myself a
157:52 - little bit more width now
157:54 - um no reason not to do this
158:00 - and there we go okay so now we just need
158:02 - to put
158:06 - now we just need to do the other arm
158:09 - we're so close people we're so close
158:13 - uh where was i it's no pal
158:16 - let's make a right arm
158:24 - which is also at everything's the same
158:29 - except okay and now
158:34 - um
158:38 - show the right arm okay but now i just
158:41 - need to put it on the other side
158:44 - so that should be
158:47 - so this is left arm x
158:51 - right arm x a plus
158:58 - okay it's our snow
159:02 - pal and p5.js all right
159:05 - there is one more thing here that i
159:08 - would like to do
159:10 - so i want to
159:14 - take off the no loop which is going to
159:16 - cause some problems oh actually i love
159:19 - that
159:19 - that's not what i meant for it to happen
159:21 - but it is kind of awesome
159:24 - jazz hands it's a snow pal with jazz
159:27 - hands
159:29 - um can i give myself
159:34 - more room
159:39 - there we go and then the snow pal
159:42 - can also
159:46 - be quite a bit bigger okay now
159:50 - reduce the number of fractals of the
159:52 - arms it is not looking nice
159:56 - could this be made into a coding
159:58 - challenge probably
160:00 - um okay so
160:03 - now uh what do i want to do so let's go
160:07 - over
160:07 - i was actually going to fix this weird
160:09 - jitteriness
160:11 - and do something different with it but
160:14 - um i kind of like
160:15 - it all of a sudden um but we could try
160:18 - having yeah this might that's a little
160:21 - bit better i think
160:22 - um okay so now
160:26 - i am going to hit save by golly
160:29 - change this to snow pal and we
160:33 - are wrapping up today's live stream
160:35 - telethon
160:36 - fundraiser i'm getting to the end
160:40 - i should put a hat on it yeah you know
160:42 - i'll i'll improve it later because i
160:43 - gotta
160:44 - it's after one o'clock i gotta get going
160:45 - here um
160:49 - we're going to sing a few more songs on
160:51 - our way out today okay
160:53 - um thicker branches yeah i could see
160:56 - that i could see a good argument for
160:58 - that
161:00 - okay ooh jazz hands jazz branches
161:03 - jazz branches is exactly right that is
161:06 - definitely jazz branches now
161:09 - we are going to
161:13 - going to look into the magic
161:16 - of microphone input
161:20 - we are going to
161:24 - create a microphone variable i don't
161:26 - need this sketch anymore
161:32 - i'm going to add in this variable mic
161:38 - mic dot start
161:44 - you guys just want this computer that's
161:45 - it right or do you have activity for me
161:47 - to do
161:49 - a meeting okay i'm coming i'm coming i'm
161:51 - almost done
161:52 - give me a second i'm really wrapping up
161:56 - soon
161:58 - um okay mic dot start
162:03 - uh okay oh whoops
162:06 - uh mic equals p5 audio in
162:11 - you wanna play the drums
162:16 - okay now get mic
162:24 - level
162:28 - and let's just
162:32 - just for the sake of argument
162:36 - just to see if this is working
162:40 - um let me turn this let's close this
162:44 - hello oh yep
162:48 - hello
162:53 - i'm gonna turn off this auto refresh
162:54 - okay so now as i talk
162:57 - the background is
163:02 - getting brighter but that's not what i
163:03 - want to do pal
163:05 - show volume
163:09 - so what what is going to change
163:13 - in the
163:20 - whoops huh
163:23 - what oh background okay
163:27 - what is going to change when i sing
163:34 - okay i think the arms
163:37 - should certainly move everything should
163:39 - dance i don't know how
163:41 - uh how far i'm gonna be able to get here
163:44 - but let's see
163:48 - um i think i can probably add this
163:52 - into parts let's just take the volume
163:57 - as a parameter that gets passed into
164:01 - all of the show functions
164:05 - arm snowball button
164:10 - there okay so now let's just try arm for
164:14 - a second so what i was thinking of doing
164:18 - was for creating
164:21 - i mean i could use random seed i could
164:23 - have an array
164:26 - i think actually though it makes sense
164:30 - what if this is just zero
164:35 - yeah okay i've got it
164:38 - so the angle goes from zero
164:42 - to um
164:45 - shows volume branch volume
164:48 - branch gets the volume uh
164:51 - angle volume i don't like hello no
164:54 - no no no oh right what what happened
165:00 - number yeah yeah that's a number what
165:02 - did you get
165:03 - show oh is it undefined because i have
165:06 - to go into the snow pal
165:09 - the snow pal needs in its show function
165:12 - to receive the volume it's like
165:14 - probably just using a global variable
165:16 - would make more sense but i'm stubborn
165:18 - i'm going to pass it around to
165:21 - everything
165:23 - hello up yep yep yep yep okay
165:26 - why why still
165:30 - am i did it just like get some
165:34 - nothing like the first time
165:38 - i'm gonna i'm not gonna worry about that
165:40 - all right let's go
165:41 - to um here
165:48 - hello oh boy that's a little bit much
165:57 - hello hello hello
166:02 - why i understand why i'm not getting
166:06 - like a nice i mean it's kind of
166:08 - like before
166:16 - oh i
166:23 - i see i need to do this
166:29 - hello whoa this is so weird
166:33 - could have sworn
166:38 - what i was doing makes sense
166:40 - [Music]
166:46 - [Music]
166:48 - what have i done wrong right if i go
166:52 - back to
167:03 - i go back to this i don't remember what
167:06 - i had
167:07 - i guess it gave me a much wider range
167:09 - right
167:18 - that's kind of what i wanted
167:22 - um seemed like such a good idea
167:26 - what is the volume
167:42 - new one to 0.2 to 0.5 right
167:52 - forget the this dot so weird
167:56 - i guess the volume like i gotta look at
167:58 - what values i'm getting for volume
168:06 - oh these these numbers are tiny
168:10 - tiny numbers
168:15 - tiny numbers
168:19 - oh oh i see the problem i've gone
168:23 - insane and now i that
168:26 - volume has to keep going because i'm not
168:28 - using oh no wonder
168:31 - okay i see
168:34 - i'm not continuing to pass it
168:37 - of course okay um
168:46 - [Music]
168:49 - it happens a lot
168:55 - yeah okay all right uh
168:58 - i don't need to console log the volume
169:00 - anymore
169:06 - forget the this dot it happens a lot
169:11 - okay that was good now okay now we've
169:13 - got our
169:14 - jazz hands going this is
169:17 - so close so close to being done all
169:19 - right let's go to the mouth
169:24 - the mouth is not uh is a button
169:28 - i think we can just
169:38 - all right i'm gonna i'm just gonna uh
169:40 - this inheritance thing is kind of silly
169:41 - here
169:42 - but let's um
169:46 - let's do a offset
170:02 - uh let's quickly just see what all the
170:05 - buttons look like if they shake around
170:08 - what what
170:14 - it just happened here people
170:18 - oh i need another bracket i'm so tired
170:22 - okay okay pretty good
170:26 - okay okay i kind of only want to shake
170:29 - the
170:29 - um so i think that i'm gonna
170:32 - i'm gonna separate out the uh
170:36 - in the snow pal this is a little bit
170:38 - ridiculous what i'm doing here
170:40 - but buttons and then
170:44 - um these are
170:48 - these are the actual buttons
170:52 - the eye and the mouth are
170:56 - different so let's actually
170:59 - just say
171:04 - let's make a mouth separate a separate
171:07 - mouth
171:08 - array
171:15 - so that i can
171:22 - do this
171:29 - okay here we go finish okay so there
171:32 - it's all still working but i believe
171:36 - now if i don't want these
171:43 - now if i go to parts
171:47 - and here if this is
171:51 - uh if i map
171:55 - volume times 100
171:59 - call this range
172:06 - uh now hello
172:09 - oh yeah okay only the mouth and the arms
172:13 - move
172:14 - they move quite a bit
172:18 - hello yay i'm singing sort of
172:24 - um and this
172:31 - [Music]
172:41 - hello i'm trying to make i was trying to
172:44 - make the um
172:46 - the size a little bit bigger too hello
172:48 - yeah there we go
172:49 - okay let the carrot also shake oh that's
172:54 - a good point
172:55 - i should be letting that carrot shake
172:58 - okay there's so much more that could be
172:59 - done here but i have to stop
173:02 - and i think also it's nice that the snow
173:06 - pal is a random size
173:08 - uh every time i start the sketch
173:12 - but um let's
173:15 - just make a larger one
173:20 - no are you serious
173:27 - how did that
173:31 - what did i do oh because there's this
173:34 - r uh whoa what oh no no
173:38 - this is what i'm trying to do
173:45 - there we go okay so it's always going to
173:47 - be this size
173:48 - and so much more could be done
173:52 - but i have to move on
