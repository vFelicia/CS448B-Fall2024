00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - good morning good Friday morning Lulu
00:08 - it's cold here in New York City but not
00:10 - cold in this room where I am
00:12 - welcome to the coding train today is a
00:16 - day that has been a long time coming
00:20 - it's almost become a bit of an inside
00:22 - joke I don't know if it's so inside an
00:24 - open joke and I'm a little bit afraid to
00:27 - actually move forward and cover this
00:29 - topic because I enjoyed the fact that it
00:32 - was just a thing that I probably would
00:34 - never get to but today I'm going to do
00:35 - it computers will not crash fire alarms
00:38 - will not go off lights will stay on
00:41 - power will stay on you will be might
00:43 - leave and go do something else but you
00:45 - might be watching I will still be here
00:46 - I'm going to talk today on the coding
00:48 - train about
01:01 - it's a really long drum sound effect oh
01:05 - I didn't say it huh my timing is
01:08 - terrible
01:09 - [Applause]
01:11 - [Music]
01:14 - chrome extension thank you thank you
01:18 - very much thank you thank you good night
01:20 - thank you thank you thank you alright so
01:26 - here we go so first of all before I get
01:30 - to that I want to I'm so I have a
01:31 - limited amount of time today although I
01:33 - do have two hours which is not that
01:34 - amount of time for a live stream but I
01:36 - have a bad habit of live-streaming for
01:38 - three or four hours often but I want to
01:41 - make some announcements first and just
01:42 - cover some business is the wrong word
01:45 - but just some kind of admin logistics
01:47 - stuff about the channel and my plans for
01:49 - the future and that kind of thing so hi
01:51 - tempting to have a new system if I go to
01:54 - the rainbow topics github repository oh
01:57 - no actually I think it's I think
02:01 - actually it's the rainbow code hold on
02:04 - Oh everything's like out of whack for me
02:06 - can this go up a little higher
02:09 - rainbow code if I go to the rainbow code
02:13 - github repository what I am now at first
02:16 - of all I am now attempting to have a
02:18 - schedule unfortunately the way things
02:21 - are working for me these days I can't I
02:23 - don't have a consistent exact time every
02:26 - week the other thing that I'm
02:27 - discovering is that some people really
02:29 - prefer this time that I'm doing right
02:31 - now especially international people who
02:33 - don't live in eastern time in the east
02:35 - coast of the United States and some
02:38 - people really prefer the later in the
02:40 - day time because it's the evening anyway
02:42 - so everybody has a different preference
02:44 - of time so one thing I'm gonna attempt
02:45 - to do I think is some Fridays do this
02:47 - time and some Fridays do the later in
02:49 - the day time and that actually is kind
02:50 - of what I need to do any with my own
02:52 - schedule but you will see I still have a
02:54 - few remnants of a little scratchy voice
02:56 - last week how do I remember since last
02:59 - year I really lost my voice so I decided
03:01 - I'm gonna be smart about this and take
03:03 - this easy when I had a bad cold last
03:05 - week and I'm still sniffly okay but so
03:11 - this is my plan so if you ever go to
03:13 - this this is a readme file that I'm
03:15 - gonna try to keep up to date with the
03:17 - schedule so to be honest it's gonna
03:22 - change it's gonna shift I wouldn't it's
03:24 - the only thing that's a true official
03:27 - indicator of the actual time I'm gonna
03:29 - livestream is when I well I can always
03:31 - change it for this to what I tweet the
03:33 - time but doesn't I'm gonna try to keep
03:35 - this up to date and when I have to cheat
03:36 - and when I realize I have to change it
03:37 - I'm gonna come right here and change it
03:39 - so that's one thing that I am attempting
03:41 - to do I'm also going to kind of keep
03:43 - track of the topics here now this only
03:44 - goes right now through December 20th the
03:48 - other thing I would love if anybody
03:49 - wants to help I know this could be done
03:52 - automatically and you're welcome to
03:53 - figure out how to do that but I also
03:55 - want to have just a list of every single
03:56 - past live stream with a link to it and
03:59 - maybe the topic as well just as kind of
04:02 - like an archived historical archive of
04:04 - all the live streams so the other thing
04:06 - is you won't see 2018 on this list yet
04:09 - but I am planning something very
04:13 - exciting for 2019 and it is
04:16 - [Music]
04:25 - [Applause]
04:26 - [Music]
04:32 - machine learning so I am going to
04:35 - attempt to come back in the new year in
04:37 - 2018 I have lots of big plans for this
04:39 - to do a whole set of tutorials and
04:42 - examples and demos around machine
04:44 - learning in the browser so I'll talk
04:47 - more about what what I'm going to use
04:48 - and who I'm collaborating with and all
04:50 - that sort of stuff soon but that's kind
04:52 - of the plan and maybe I'll get to some
04:53 - of that even before January but that
04:56 - least is my time that I am targeting
04:58 - right now so for all of those have you
04:59 - been asking
05:02 - that's the plan alright so what are some
05:05 - other things that I can say dude are you
05:08 - interested in let's see so there's some
05:13 - okay so if also if you're interested in
05:17 - supporting the work that I do you can
05:19 - buy some merchandise at the at store
05:21 - envy coding train comm you can also
05:24 - become a patron through this
05:27 - crowdfunding site called patreon and if
05:30 - you join the patreon group you will get
05:34 - an invite to a slack channel which is
05:36 - one right here where I'm seeing that
05:38 - grey wizard and the slack channel is
05:39 - asking me if the board is clean it is
05:44 - clean do I have an eraser no I never
05:47 - have an eraser but I do have a
05:48 - whiteboard marker so thank you great
05:50 - wizard for that so and at different
05:53 - levels I'll attempt to send you a gift
05:55 - and that sort of thing ah now I am very
05:58 - behind on sending out the patron reward
06:01 - so in case anybody who's watching
06:02 - happens to be a patron I want to let you
06:04 - know that Matthew and I are going
06:07 - through spreadsheets and lists and
06:09 - checking in and organizing so I'm hoping
06:11 - to get everybody who's at least joined
06:13 - all the way up to the beginning of up
06:17 - until now basically something by the end
06:19 - of the year mailed out by the end of the
06:21 - year so that's kind of my goal and if at
06:24 - any time you are feel like you were
06:28 - supposed to get something but you didn't
06:29 - get something send me or send Matt Chia
06:32 - a message a direct message in the slack
06:34 - group okay so that's what I want to say
06:37 - I think that's about it alright so I
06:49 - gotta get started let's see so first of
06:51 - all let's just check in on a couple like
06:55 - things from the community let's look at
06:59 - hashtag circle morphing let's see if
07:04 - we've got so recently they're the most
07:06 - recent coding challenge that I did was
07:08 - about circle morphing different
07:10 - algorithms and techniques inspired by a
07:13 - gif
07:13 - repository and tutorial video from Golan
07:16 - Levin of different ways and this looks
07:19 - like something that's like responding to
07:20 - sound so oh yeah it's responding to
07:22 - sound and it's changing between the
07:23 - circle and the triangle so morphing from
07:25 - a circle to a triangle to a square
07:27 - here's another one ooh this is really
07:29 - nice this is good for meditation I
07:41 - forgot where I was for a second okay
07:43 - let's let's look at some more this is
07:45 - from Cobain a on Twitter look at this
07:48 - this is this is something that's not
07:50 - related to the coding challenge but
07:53 - whoops and what just happened here I
07:56 - don't know what I just did on top okay
07:58 - so and so anyway so let's keep looking
08:00 - oh this is kind of a wild one from
08:02 - Robert Swain on Twitter which is somehow
08:04 - combining the maize generation tutorial
08:07 - I have with the a-star pathfinding to
08:10 - get all the vertices along the path of a
08:13 - triangle I kept this is like I'd have no
08:15 - idea how this works or what it's doing
08:17 - but it's kind of nuts and amazing in a
08:19 - wonderful way ooh I have not seen this
08:21 - one whoa that is wild ooh all right this
08:27 - is a lovely one have not seen this one
08:29 - that is pretty cool so please continue
08:33 - let's look at this code pen continue to
08:36 - share your oh yeah look at this that's
08:43 - pretty nice
08:44 - Oh order chaos to order order to chaos
08:47 - kind of love that kind of stuff let's
08:49 - hit refresh watch this one more time
08:51 - oh so this looks like all the points of
08:53 - the vertices of that circle being just
08:55 - from random locations and then all
08:57 - slowly moving back to their original
08:59 - location wonderful okay so I'm looking
09:06 - at the chat and I'm seeing that my
09:10 - computer science class just finished Oh
09:12 - excellent go computer science class all
09:18 - right so I want to get started the other
09:20 - thing that I want to quickly check in on
09:22 - is I'm going to go to
09:25 - my twitter feed slash Schiffman and i'm
09:29 - going to go to this thread and let's
09:32 - look at Noah van boven if you are
09:36 - watching I need a link to your extension
09:39 - if I'm going to use it as something to
09:41 - show so I want to just get a few
09:44 - examples of creative why can't I not use
09:48 - my computer today I want to get a link
09:52 - to some creative Chrome extensions and
09:57 - let's look at this one I think this one
10:00 - might have some interesting language oh
10:02 - that's pretty great bookmarklet okay
10:05 - this is a family-friendly
10:07 - coding show though so I think I
10:10 - ppreciate subversive and strong activist
10:17 - artworks I might not use that one just
10:19 - for today so this is okay this is great
10:20 - delete show nest I'm looking for girls
10:23 - vs. get from addy wagenknecht anybody in
10:27 - the slack channel if you can pull
10:29 - something from the YouTube chat or if
10:30 - you have something I'm looking for
10:32 - examples of creative artistic activists
10:36 - subversive things that are Chrome
10:38 - extensions that are maybe not
10:39 - necessarily what Chrome extensions were
10:42 - intended for in the most obvious sense
10:43 - that a business might use to you know
10:46 - tell you if there's a coupon on the
10:48 - webpage you're on or whatever okay so
10:49 - I'm looking for this is a Chrome
10:51 - extension from the artists at addy
10:54 - wagenknecht who is fantastic great so
10:56 - I've got the deletion esthe I've got
10:58 - this one there is one which is like
11:00 - called code doodles chrome extension I
11:04 - think this one is a nice one if I just
11:08 - go to the page for it this is a great
11:11 - one and wordless web this is one of my
11:21 - favorite projects but I couldn't find it
11:28 - Corie for sites and Gigli this is a
11:32 - wonderful bookmarklet called wordless
11:36 - web but it doesn't seem to exist anymore
11:38 - if anybody can find this for me
11:41 - historically a version of the wordless
11:43 - web bookmarklets if it's somewhere I
11:46 - would love to demonstrate this one as
11:49 - well okay so this is where I'm getting
11:52 - started I've got the deletion s I've got
11:56 - Co doodles
11:57 - I've got girls versus git and I've got
12:00 - wordless web and Noah van boven if
12:03 - you're watching I would love to see an
12:05 - extension lets you draw on the current
12:07 - web page that is exactly that's one of
12:09 - the examples that I would like to make
12:10 - with p5.js okay Oh momentum that's the
12:15 - one everybody loves everybody at ITP all
12:18 - my students have this momentum Chrome
12:21 - extension let's get that one as well
12:25 - okay I'm looking in the chat I don't see
12:29 - any other suggestions okay I'm gonna
12:35 - make one that changes all of your images
12:37 - to kittens that's what I think that's
12:40 - what our unicorns or something like that
12:42 - all right so I think I want to jump
12:44 - right into this is I know Simon will
12:46 - appreciate this it's always timing me I
12:48 - want to jump right in to teaching and
12:50 - tutorials it is 10:43 a.m. I've got till
12:54 - 12:30 so I want to see I've got a lot of
12:56 - let me open up my chrome extension
12:59 - tutorial page I've got a lot of examples
13:02 - and pieces that I want to make but but I
13:13 - won't have time to get to everything
13:14 - today so this might be a two-parter off
13:16 - to come back and revisit stuff can
13:22 - somebody say on the slack chat I've
13:23 - posted a link on Twitter again alright
13:25 - excellent Thank You Noah so let me go to
13:30 - back to this thread here we go well now
13:42 - I have the link to momentum Noah I want
13:45 - the link to yours
13:49 - let me see let me just maybe it's just
13:51 - in your Twitter
13:54 - oops here we go wet paint found it thank
13:57 - you Oh wonderful
13:59 - oh look at this is amazing wonderful
14:01 - this is perfect thank you I'm going to
14:03 - feature this so we'll install a couple
14:06 - of these we'll install a couple of these
14:12 - web paint being one girls versus kid I
14:16 - think I will just mention cuz it's not
14:17 - in the chrome store actually let's let's
14:20 - let me try to install this to see if it
14:22 - works
14:23 - still so I'm gonna do this before I
14:27 - start my opening video and what I'm
14:34 - going to do so I'm gonna do some stuff
14:36 - that I'm going to actually cover in the
14:37 - tutorial but I want to just have an
14:40 - opening video talking about what why you
14:42 - might be interested in this topic of
14:43 - Chrome extensions so I'm gonna do some
14:49 - stuff here for a second that I will
14:51 - cover how to do in a little bit let's
14:55 - see if this works so hold on here we go
15:07 - there we go great this is working
15:17 - but it's not doing it let's see so Oh
15:26 - girls versus get is broken probably we
15:29 - might have to hold on let's disable this
15:35 - one we might have to fix it we might as
15:39 - a community have to pull requests so
15:42 - I'll just have to talk about this one
15:44 - it's too bad that I can't show it wonder
15:49 - if I can debug this really quickly
15:53 - helper functions Jas cannot read
15:56 - undefined yet let's just try a different
15:59 - page see if it activates no oh oh I'm
16:05 - going into the territory of things that
16:07 - I don't want to do so what it's supposed
16:11 - to do is it changes the color scheme and
16:13 - it changes swaps out the avatars and
16:15 - that type of thing I'm gonna give myself
16:17 - a couple seconds if anybody watching
16:19 - wants to investigate knows Chrome
16:21 - extensions already wants to investigate
16:23 - but I don't want to lose I mean it's
16:25 - more important that I get to the
16:26 - tutorial stuff but I want it to open by
16:28 - demonstrating some interesting projects
16:30 - made by other people and addy is one of
16:32 - my favorite artists oh this is a packed
16:38 - one hold on let me just try one other
16:41 - thing disabled no no okay so let me go
16:52 - to source scripts helper functions let's
16:58 - just see if we can fix it because github
17:01 - probably changed line 63 whoa so there's
17:08 - like some parsing going on of oh it may
17:13 - be because I'm not logged in know that
17:17 - so I don't think I'm gonna be able to
17:18 - effectively debug this without losing
17:20 - too much time and not getting to the
17:22 - tutorials so that's fine I will just
17:24 - show the home page for
17:25 - we don't have to run it yeah but I am
17:28 - logged in so right look at me logged
17:32 - into github right there so I am going to
17:35 - just not worry about it so let's remove
17:39 - this one and I will come back to it I
17:42 - will look at that later and maybe we
17:44 - great to have that extension I mean it's
17:45 - an old a project from years ago I don't
17:47 - know if addy is interested in keeping it
17:48 - maintained but I would certainly be
17:51 - happy to help I am going to at least
17:56 - open up her website so I can mention
18:02 - that all right
18:03 - anybody find wordless web all right I
18:10 - think I'm ready now okay oh good
18:33 - 10:50 so I'm gonna do a quick in case
18:36 - anyone's following along this is now
18:38 - part of the programming from A to Z
18:40 - course this is a course that I made a
18:43 - whole lot of videos for a year ago and
18:46 - then I recently this year added some
18:50 - videos about chatbots and oh my goodness
18:52 - I just have to mention this is a
19:00 - wonderful project that just came out
19:04 - which is by Nicole key and Nick Jonas I
19:09 - think it's a different Nick Jonas than
19:10 - the one you might be thinking of called
19:13 - mystery animal it's a voice experiment
19:15 - for Google home and Nicole wrote up a
19:18 - really amazing yeah medium post about
19:22 - how this was made so I would highly
19:24 - encourage her this I actually one of the
19:26 - tools that she used
19:28 - it's called dialogue flow and so this is
19:32 - something that I really want to I don't
19:37 - know if I'm in the right place but this
19:38 - is something that I really want to take
19:39 - a look at at some point if I can get
19:41 - back to that jackpot series as well as
19:44 - there is also something that was
19:47 - recently open sourced by Google the
19:49 - project by Kate Compton the creator of
19:51 - tracery and many other amazing things
19:54 - that I always love to talk about called
19:56 - battery and so if I look for battery
20:00 - this is something I haven't had a
20:02 - conversational agent prototyping
20:04 - platform that I have not had a chance to
20:05 - really look at but I would love to do
20:07 - this in a future videos ah stop
20:09 - procrastinating let's get to the topic
20:10 - of today but you guys can remind me
20:12 - about these things and I will get to
20:14 - them alright we are now ready for what
20:21 - is this session 12 maybe of programming
20:24 - from A to Z is that possibly correct
20:31 - alright I'm the wordless web github.com
20:39 - /ban tick wordless web thank you
20:44 - wordless web oh boy let's see well
20:57 - that's is this let's just try all right
21:06 - van tick github io is it hosted with
21:13 - github pages whoops Mantic github dot
21:21 - word less wet no come on van tick I
21:29 - guess I could clone it and build it all
21:35 - right hold on this might be as simple
21:37 - actually as I just I don't have I don't
21:43 - think I have Jekyll installed but could
21:46 - I at least just do this it just doesn't
21:51 - have the styling but that's fine
22:00 - nope ah this is totally it all right do
22:08 - I have Jekyll this is making me crazy
22:13 - it's probably not worth oh I do have
22:22 - Jekyll awesome just like I don't want to
22:25 - go through installing it Jekyll serve
22:31 - whoops I tripped in server but that
22:34 - seemed to do something by accident okay
22:39 - there we go
22:42 - wordless web let's just try like New
22:47 - York Times comm all right doesn't seem
22:57 - to be working
23:06 - oh it needs to connect to Oh cuz that's
23:09 - not there okay I'm have to hold on
23:11 - iiiii I know I could fix it but I'm just
23:14 - not going to I'm gonna get to the topic
23:16 - I know how to get this working but it'll
23:18 - be here later I'll come back and get all
23:20 - these other projects that I love working
23:22 - the deletion astiz kind of similar idea
23:25 - here okay all right let's get started
23:30 - everybody are you ready session 11 you
23:37 - sure the chat bot wasn't session 11
23:47 - session 10 chat BOTS you're right Thank
23:49 - You Simon
23:50 - alright so please can you guys hear the
23:52 - vacuum cleaner
24:03 - it is a very loud vacuum cleaner I'm now
24:06 - in the hallway
24:09 - and hopefully it's not causing too much
24:12 - of a sound problem but I'm here in the
24:15 - actual room itself here we go Oh where's
24:22 - my bell hello welcome to another session
24:30 - for the course programming from A to Z
24:33 - and accept accept if you're watching
24:36 - this video it's called programming with
24:38 - text on YouTube because programming from
24:41 - A to Z sounds like it's a beginner
24:42 - course and this course is really for
24:44 - people have already gone through my
24:46 - foundations of JavaScript stuff and I
24:48 - want to do more things with programming
24:50 - with text generating text analyzing text
24:52 - and a lot of different things like that
24:54 - so one of the what what is this playlist
24:57 - going to be about this playlist is about
24:59 - Chrome extensions and words that I can't
25:03 - say book bar clips I like to say
25:05 - bookmark lay no that doesn't make any
25:07 - sense I was like the French for the book
25:09 - bar play no bookmarklets it's very hard
25:11 - to say bookmarklets so why is why is
25:13 - this interesting why is this important
25:15 - so all of my sessions in this particular
25:19 - course have all been about I mean this
25:23 - is not entirely true but this is a web
25:25 - browser the sessions have all been about
25:28 - programming kind of what happens inside
25:31 - here inside the actual content of the
25:35 - page by creating your own I know it's a
25:39 - vacuum cleaner because I live in the
25:41 - real world where the things happen like
25:44 - vacuuming but I'm just go on my own eyes
25:50 - my mind lives in its own universe though
25:52 - which hopefully makes these videos
25:54 - somewhat watchable but or not anyway so
25:57 - this is what we've been focusing on and
25:58 - maybe you make an HTML file and a
26:03 - JavaScript file all sorts of things to
26:06 - make things happen in here but working
26:10 - and working with text so you make a web
26:11 - page it generates a poem and it makes a
26:13 - chatbot with the user all these kinds of
26:15 - things that I've looked at analyzes text
26:18 - that a user typed in but what if what
26:20 - you really want to do you
26:22 - affect the browsing experience as a
26:25 - whole so what if what you want to do is
26:28 - say when the user is on the website
26:30 - github or when the user is on the
26:32 - website of a particular newspaper their
26:35 - experience the that users experience of
26:38 - browsing that web page changes now this
26:41 - is typically done and so a way to do
26:44 - this is with two different things one is
26:47 - called a book mark lint which is a way
26:51 - of creating a simple bookmark button
26:54 - that can live up here that can run some
26:58 - JavaScript code to alter and change your
27:01 - view of the current web page you're on
27:03 - the other is called a Chrome extension
27:06 - now you can imagine here the reason one
27:12 - sort of one one limitation of me making
27:16 - this tutorial video is that it is a
27:18 - Chrome extension it is only for the
27:20 - browser Chrome but it allows you to
27:24 - essentially make if you think about
27:25 - chrome like you might think about your
27:27 - phone you could develop an app for your
27:29 - phone to alter your experience of using
27:31 - your phone a Chrome extension is like an
27:34 - app for the web browser Chrome itself
27:36 - that allows you to alter the behavior of
27:38 - the browser beyond just what's happening
27:40 - in the page so you can add interface
27:42 - elements you can know about what people
27:44 - are typing into the address bar you can
27:47 - create a page that shows up whenever
27:48 - somebody has a new tab you could know
27:51 - that somebody said new tab you could
27:52 - know you could you could pop up a timer
27:55 - whenever our user is on you know some
27:58 - sort of like social media website to
28:01 - tell them you only have five more
28:02 - minutes to look at this website and then
28:03 - close the tab for them anything you
28:05 - could do to alter subvert change the
28:08 - browsing experience
28:09 - now this exists as a business model
28:11 - because companies can make Chrome
28:14 - extensions to you know offer you a
28:15 - coupon or I don't know have pop-up Chat
28:20 - pop-up that offers to give you help on
28:22 - that page I use a Chrome extension
28:24 - called two buddy I'm now which I'm now
28:26 - by accident promoting which gives me
28:28 - extra features to see how to manipulate
28:31 - and know my stats and all the sort of
28:33 - stuff while I'm browsing you
28:34 - - so that's really but what I want to
28:36 - think about in this playlist are this
28:39 - idea I'm just gonna call it for lack of
28:42 - a better word creative Chrome extensions
28:44 - so what if you use a crow what if you
28:46 - create a Chrome extension to subvert
28:48 - distort change our browsing experience
28:50 - for the purpose of social commentary or
28:53 - art or activism and I should mention
28:56 - there's something important about this
28:57 - this is not something that you can just
28:59 - put on somebody's computer you can make
29:02 - a web page put it on a web server email
29:04 - all your friends they come to my web
29:06 - page but you you can't put a Chrome
29:10 - extension on somebody's computer without
29:11 - them opting into that we'll see that in
29:14 - a moment as we look at the Chrome
29:15 - extension
29:15 - store however I'm not really in this
29:18 - playlist going to focus at all about how
29:20 - you can deploy your Chrome extension to
29:21 - the store I'm gonna show you how to use
29:23 - a Chrome extension in what's called
29:25 - developer mode so you can write and
29:29 - create and debug and edit and change
29:31 - your Chrome extension right there on
29:33 - your own computer if it's something that
29:35 - you then want to distribute you can
29:37 - package it and put it into the chrome
29:40 - store and I'm just super so kind of
29:42 - approval process there but we're gonna
29:43 - stay with a sort of local development
29:45 - environment so this is kind of the
29:48 - overall picture and so in the first two
29:52 - first tutorial what I'm going to do is
29:54 - has a warm-up kind of looking a
29:57 - bookmarklet which is kind of a much
30:00 - simpler lower look lower barrier of
30:05 - entry point to just do something
30:06 - interesting with manipulating the
30:08 - browsing experience so I'm gonna start
30:09 - with that and that so if you if you want
30:11 - to get to the code stuff you'd stop this
30:12 - video now just go to the next one but
30:15 - what I'm going to do before I get to
30:18 - that is let's look at some examples of
30:19 - some different Chrome extensions all
30:22 - right pause for a second oh is there a
30:27 - is there a cs50 live stream going on
30:29 - right now how do i watch that
30:39 - who live now you guys can't hear this
30:52 - can you how many people are watching
30:59 - there okay so I got distracted
31:10 - okay watch that anymore a wordless web
31:13 - Oh Oh Ryan it's oh that's awesome
31:17 - thank you can you Oh Ryan 13 can you in
31:25 - the slack channel I don't have slack
31:27 - open on this computer and I want to
31:30 - retype that if you could I'm trying to
31:35 - think if you could like to tweet that to
31:37 - me if you could just put it in a gist
31:39 - that I could get to then I can get that
31:43 - to run here I'm more popular well first
31:49 - of all if you want to watch something
31:51 - I'm sure that cs50 is like actually very
31:54 - very very good
31:56 - there's 648 people watching this right
31:58 - now freaked out alright so I'm gonna
32:05 - wait for anyone in the slack channel to
32:08 - perhaps get me that wordless web code so
32:16 - I could use it but I will right now keep
32:21 - going okay so I'm gonna now pretend for
32:26 - Matthew this is now editing magic all
32:31 - right so let's look at a couple examples
32:32 - of things that I'm thinking about this
32:34 - is a bookmark that called the deletion
32:37 - ascent to me on Twitter and I believe it
32:41 - actually relates to something that I did
32:42 - a previous video about erasure of poetry
32:44 - kind of which is that let's try it so a
32:47 - bookmarklet is a thing that I can drag
32:50 - into the book
32:51 - our bar and then in theory when I press
32:55 - this button oh it got rid of stuff so
33:00 - let's go to let's go to github.com and
33:05 - let me click the deletion nest what and
33:08 - it got rid this is actually very very
33:10 - similar to one of my favorite
33:12 - bookmarklets called wordless web which
33:14 - actually gets rid of everything on a web
33:16 - page that is text which has some really
33:19 - surprising and interesting effects
33:21 - trying to think of one more website
33:24 - that's not going to make me feel so
33:26 - awkward and uncomfortable to go to to
33:29 - demonstrate this idea but anyway I
33:31 - encourage you to play with the deletion
33:33 - so this is something maybe we'll make a
33:35 - bookmarklet that replaces every image on
33:38 - the webpage with like kitten kitten
33:40 - images or something like that we'll do
33:41 - that another Chrome extension that I
33:45 - wanted to show you is by one of my
33:46 - favorite artists I'm adding wagenknecht
33:49 - her website is places I've never been
33:51 - calm this is a Chrome extension that she
33:54 - created called girls versus get I'll
33:57 - just read to you what it does every
33:59 - username on github is replaced with a
34:01 - generic female username every Gravatar
34:03 - is a place with a Gravatar of a woman or
34:04 - female type image why there is a death
34:09 - of women contribute to open source
34:10 - software this plug-in is presented as a
34:11 - filter to challenge assumptions about
34:13 - gender roles and software and to rewire
34:15 - your brain so you can see here you can
34:17 - imagine this is a one something you
34:19 - could do with a Chrome extension is it
34:21 - only activates when you're on certain
34:22 - web pages and changes your view of that
34:25 - web page and so you can see this is this
34:28 - is on github I will include links to all
34:30 - these Chrome extensions and bookmarklets
34:32 - in the video description I'm gonna come
34:36 - back to wordless web this is a Chrome
34:39 - extension that was submitted by I'm just
34:43 - want to make sure I have the right name
34:44 - looking in the slack channel here
34:48 - I believe sorry Noah van boven I
34:55 - apologize for pronouncing the name
34:56 - incorrectly called
34:57 - web paint let's try adding it so if you
35:00 - make a Chrome extension that's in the
35:02 - actual chrome extension store
35:05 - you can just go and hit add to chrome'
35:08 - now here something really important this
35:11 - is what I mean by opting in Chrome
35:13 - extensions get a lot more permission to
35:15 - do stuff beyond what you would normally
35:17 - have just in a generic regular web page
35:20 - so this Chrome extension says it can
35:22 - read and change all your data on the
35:24 - websites you visit presumably this has
35:27 - been vetted by Google I suppose and it's
35:29 - in the chrome store because it doesn't
35:30 - do stuff like you know steal all your
35:33 - passwords but this is certainly other
35:36 - certainly security and privacy issues
35:38 - that are at play here but I'm gonna add
35:40 - this extension and then what I'm going
35:43 - to do is I'm gonna go back to github.com
35:46 - Schiffman a-to-z I'm gonna like now one
35:49 - thing a Chrome extension can do and
35:51 - we're gonna see this is you can add menu
35:53 - options to the menu like this button so
35:57 - now I'm gonna click this button look you
36:00 - can even do a pop-up well I'm gonna show
36:01 - you how to do pop-ups too and I'm gonna
36:04 - pick this pencil and now I'm gonna just
36:07 - start doodling or it so this is by the
36:09 - way this is very similar to a what else
36:12 - can we do this is so fun this is way
36:15 - better than my example ah anyway I
36:16 - clicked off of it but you can see this
36:18 - is something that I intend to make as
36:20 - part of this playlist a Chrome extension
36:21 - that allows you use p5.js to draw and
36:25 - make a canvas overlay over your over the
36:29 - webpage that you're currently browsing
36:31 - on ok another Chrome extension is one
36:34 - called code doodles this is something
36:36 - you can do too
36:37 - I forgot what it's called but to create
36:39 - a web page that appears so right now if
36:41 - I make a new tab I don't have a Chrome
36:43 - extension that replaces the default
36:46 - chrome new tab which just shows me the
36:48 - Google search bar and some recently
36:49 - visited sites but momentum is another
36:52 - one all my students will have this one I
36:54 - should probably install it let's try the
36:55 - code doodles one so I'm going to add
36:57 - this one it says this one all I can do
36:59 - is replace the page you see when opening
37:01 - a new tab add extension and so now every
37:06 - time I make a new tab I get whoa I get
37:09 - some cool interesting code doodle
37:13 - project oh so I would have to research
37:17 - this more to know
37:18 - credits wise like who these are coming
37:20 - from I wonder if it's still oh it's
37:23 - loading wow these are all like super
37:24 - crazy WebGL 3d things which is kind of
37:27 - wild so so you can see the range of
37:30 - possibilities I also wanted to mention
37:34 - I'm just checking the chat here I'm
37:39 - already getting ok so I'm getting all
37:40 - these great messages about other Chrome
37:42 - extensions and things but I also want to
37:46 - mention a wordless web which is one of
37:48 - my favorite projects very similar to the
37:54 - wordless web sorry by Corey Forsythe and
37:58 - G Lee which this is a Chrome extension
38:01 - that takes whatever website you're on so
38:03 - you can see this is an image of Facebook
38:05 - and just gets rid of all the words and
38:07 - all you're left with are just the images
38:09 - it's be interesting the thing about
38:10 - doing one that does the other so I hope
38:13 - this video gives you kind of a general
38:14 - introduction to the it's the words
38:17 - diagram ever overview of why it is we're
38:19 - here and a range of some kind of
38:22 - creative and artistic possibilities and
38:24 - what I'm gonna do in the next bunch of
38:26 - videos is just really go through the
38:28 - nuts and bolts of how to make these
38:30 - things and then at some point hopefully
38:32 - towards the end I'll do a couple coding
38:34 - challenges to make some quirky Chrome
38:36 - extension or bookmarklet projects okay
38:38 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
38:40 - maybe in the next video
38:44 - okay alright so that could use some
38:49 - improvements thank you for everybody
38:51 - submitting wordless web and the fix for
38:54 - girls versus get but I think that's
38:58 - gonna do it right here alright that's
39:03 - the end of my coffee I didn't drink
39:05 - coffee for like two weeks gonna have
39:07 - this like cold and throat thing but
39:09 - today I'm back alright so I'm looking
39:17 - I'm looking I'm thinking okay so let me
39:21 - get set up for the first let me get set
39:27 - up for the first video so what I'm going
39:29 - to first look at how to do is make a
39:32 - look when we call this uh I'll just call
39:36 - this folder Chrome extensions and I'm
39:38 - gonna make a folder called bookmark
39:40 - let's bookmark see I even spelled it
39:43 - weirdly and then all I need let me let
39:48 - me go back here let me open this up in
39:51 - Adam and we actually don't need to run a
40:00 - web server for doing Chrome extensions
40:01 - the way we're going to deploy them to
40:03 - the browser is gonna be a totally
40:04 - different way but for this bookmarklet I
40:05 - am going to excuse me so I'm gonna go to
40:12 - a desktop Chrome extensions bookmarklet
40:17 - and then I'll better run a little server
40:19 - I mean I actually could get away without
40:21 - running a server but it's totally fine
40:23 - so now I need Chrome open and I'm going
40:30 - to make a little webpage call it
40:36 - index.html what's like some generic let
40:40 - me just go and grab some like a whoa Oh
40:51 - seriously
40:52 - let me grab some index.html from
40:55 - somewhere else and I really don't care
41:01 - about a lot of this stuff I mean this
41:09 - just one a very generic this this is
41:12 - good enough for like totally generic
41:13 - HTML right
41:22 - okay okay
41:30 - and all right so Oh
41:38 - Thank You Simon I want to I want to
41:42 - clear out all of them oh that's a nice
41:46 - one
41:46 - hope actually having this I do want to
41:48 - clear these out because I want this to
41:50 - be empty when I get to leave this one in
41:54 - here when I get to demonstrating this
41:56 - stuff okay how's everybody doing
42:01 - everybody okay I think we're ready for
42:02 - makeup bookmarklet well I was like no
42:11 - I'm not ready yet
42:16 - yeah I'm gonna erase this we need to
42:27 - refill this with water
42:46 - seems have to be fine for them alright
42:54 - okay let's see do I have another this is
43:09 - making me crazy how dirty this is right
43:13 - here so let's try to
43:34 - all right in this video tutorial I am
43:37 - going to make a very basic simple
43:40 - bookmarklet I might come back and do
43:43 - like a coding challenge with a more like
43:45 - sophisticated one but this I just want
43:46 - to show you the basic idea and this is
43:48 - really just a warm-up a lot of things
43:50 - that you could do so this is a warmup oh
43:53 - I should really just get to the code but
43:55 - I start over I got hello this is a video
44:04 - tutorial where I'm going to show you how
44:05 - to make a very simple basic bookmarklet
44:08 - and this is really a warm-up my goal
44:10 - here in the next video in the video
44:12 - after that and the video after that is
44:14 - to start looking at Chrome extensions
44:15 - Chrome extensions are a much more
44:17 - powerful way to affect the browsing
44:20 - experience as a whole and actually the
44:22 - interface elements and all sorts of
44:25 - stuff in the Chrome browser but a
44:27 - bookmarklet is a really quick and easy
44:29 - way to add a button that's like a
44:31 - bookmark that triggers some code that
44:33 - changes your browsing experience so
44:34 - let's look at how that works so before I
44:36 - get to that I want to talk about some
44:41 - things about JavaScript and you know I'm
44:43 - going to kind of live in es5 which is
44:45 - kind of the a1c I'm gonna lipid es5
45:00 - which is and not use some of the fancier
45:03 - newer JavaScript syntax just to sort of
45:04 - demonstrate the simplicity of the idea
45:06 - but I I'm sure that it will get people
45:09 - watching who will help suggest fancier
45:11 - ways to write the same code and I look
45:13 - forward to including that in the
45:14 - material supplemental materials that'll
45:16 - be linked from this video subscription
45:17 - so if you've ever made a function in
45:20 - JavaScript you might have done this
45:22 - function you know hello curly bracket
45:27 - curly no parentheses parentheses curly
45:30 - bracket curly bracket if I want to
45:32 - execute this function I want to run that
45:36 - function I would just say hello with the
45:38 - parentheses that means execute this
45:40 - function so now you are probably aware
45:44 - for my eraser here it is you are
45:46 - probably aware that in JavaScript
45:49 - functions can be anonymous meaning they
45:53 - don't have to have a name and it can
45:54 - just look like this but then how do you
46:00 - execute the function so typically you
46:02 - might write an anonymous function
46:04 - because you're passing it in somewhere
46:05 - as a callback and somewhere else it's
46:06 - gonna get a reference to it and call it
46:08 - somewhere but in the case of a
46:10 - bookmarklet what a bookmarklet actually
46:12 - is it's a JavaScript function that when
46:14 - you press the button it runs and so a
46:18 - funny thing that you can do if this is
46:20 - the entire right remember if this was
46:22 - named hello then I could execute the
46:25 - function with the name and these two
46:27 - parentheses I can actually just execute
46:30 - the function by putting the two
46:31 - parentheses there so this is like an
46:33 - anonymous self executing function okay I
46:36 - think that's right there's some probably
46:38 - of appropriate technical term for it so
46:40 - this is actually somewhat a bookmarklet
46:42 - actually is and if I just put something
46:44 - like console dot log or alert maybe
46:48 - alert will be a good I I think never I
46:49 - have this like mission in life to never
46:51 - ever use a JavaScript alert and I'm
46:53 - gonna somehow I'm gonna do that but I'm
46:56 - gonna break that mission that's it right
46:58 - now so I could say alert you know hello
47:00 - so if this were the code for my
47:03 - bookmarklet whatever the user presses
47:05 - the button or goes to that quote unquote
47:07 - bookmark this code is gonna execute so
47:12 - this begs the question this is very
47:14 - simple idea and and now it's up to you
47:16 - like what do you put in here you can
47:18 - read you this is where you can start
47:20 - parsing and looking at what's on the
47:21 - webpage and changing it in real time
47:23 - with JavaScript but other question is
47:26 - where's this code go so now let's look
47:28 - at that alright so you might be aware
47:32 - that if you go so if you go to a URL and
47:35 - this you don't really see that Chrome by
47:37 - the way is hiding the fact that this is
47:39 - HTTP colon slash slash so I could go to
47:43 - URL by saying HTTP that's I'm saying I
47:46 - want to make a hypertext Transfer
47:48 - Protocol get request to this URL but I
47:50 - can also in the browser look at things
47:53 - that are
47:55 - like files on the computer so I can open
47:59 - up index of HTML and you can see oh look
48:00 - now I'm going to the file colon slash
48:03 - slash but I can actually there is and
48:07 - there's actually like a data path where
48:09 - I can do you base64 encoded images
48:11 - there's all sorts of different kinds of
48:13 - paths that the address bar will accept
48:15 - one of them happens to be JavaScript I
48:20 - let's dare I try to do this function oh
48:25 - shoot
48:36 - well you know what I hate do I need
48:38 - parentheses around the whole thing yep
48:42 - yep yep i Function oh I am remembering
48:49 - something that I'm also being told in
48:51 - the chat I made a little mistake here
48:53 - which is that in order for you to
48:56 - execute this function the way that I've
48:58 - described here you actually have to also
49:00 - enclose the entire nameless or anonymous
49:03 - function in parentheses itself so
49:05 - otherwise it's that's unclear I guess to
49:08 - the interpreter like what this actually
49:11 - matches up with so this is execute the
49:13 - function that's inside these parentheses
49:15 - I'm pretty sure that's required so now
49:19 - let's come back here and so the reason
49:21 - why I saw that's just now I'm going to
49:22 - actually just type that code in right
49:24 - here in the address bar function that's
49:28 - gonna be really hard
49:29 - function curly bracket alert hello
49:37 - semicolon close curly bracket close
49:39 - parentheses parentheses parentheses so
49:41 - this is me saying I want to go to this
49:44 - URL it's JavaScript colon slash slash I
49:47 - don't think you need to slash slash if
49:50 - I'm thinking about this I think it's
49:52 - just JavaScript colon and then this code
49:55 - which is a self-executing anonymous
49:57 - function so I'm gonna zoom back out here
50:00 - and I'm going to now hit enter as if I'm
50:02 - loading this web page and I get this
50:05 - alert the page says hello
50:07 - so this that's actually what a
50:09 - bookmarklet is and I wish I had copy
50:11 - paste in that because now all I need to
50:14 - do is I can say I can have a paragraph
50:17 - and I can say I can say hey this is a
50:21 - and I can say aah ref equals book mark
50:26 - litt all right so look take a look at
50:29 - this now we can see this here now if I
50:32 - click on this nothing happens so what
50:35 - can go in a a what can be the H ref to
50:39 - an a tag it could be a URL it could be
50:45 - lots of things one of the things that
50:47 - can be is
50:48 - actual javascript code so for example
50:51 - that same thing that I typed JavaScript
50:54 - : function oh I need to put a
50:57 - parenthesis around the function function
51:00 - parenthesis curly bracket alert hello
51:10 - close quote close parenthesis close
51:14 - curly bracket close parenthesis execute
51:17 - so now let's try refreshing this page
51:20 - and now whenever I click on that it runs
51:23 - that JavaScript code now guess what if I
51:28 - wanted to bookmark a URL all the whole
51:31 - thing like if I like here I have a
51:33 - bookmark up here to the rainbow topics
51:35 - github repository if I click edit all
51:38 - this is is a name for this particular
51:40 - URL a bookmarklet is just a named set of
51:43 - JavaScript code so I can now say I can
51:49 - now write if actually what I can I could
51:51 - have created but I can actually just
51:52 - drag this up here and you can see look
51:55 - at that now I have this here and every
51:56 - time you I click on it I get that alert
52:00 - click alert click alert and if I go edit
52:05 - we can see this is just this now its URL
52:10 - encoded it did that for me because a
52:12 - quote is not a valid a valid character
52:17 - in a URL so the this has been URL
52:20 - encoded meaning % 27 you office li-like
52:22 - % 20 that means space % 27 currently
52:26 - means a single quote I think so you can
52:28 - see you can write it this way now so in
52:30 - a way we're done yay we made a
52:33 - bookmarklet but we haven't really done
52:35 - anything yet like here something is this
52:38 - really sustainable is this the thing
52:40 - like oh my goodness and I how am I going
52:42 - to send what if I want to do something
52:43 - really elaborate I want to crawl I want
52:45 - to look at all the content on that web
52:47 - page and I want to find all the
52:49 - paragraph elements and I want to look
52:51 - anytime the word puppy is in there I
52:54 - want to change the word puppy to kitten
52:55 - so it's a it's a bookmarklet that
52:58 - changes puppies the kittens or swap
52:59 - images out or change the
53:02 - color of every webpage to a random color
53:04 - all these things are possible but
53:06 - working with kind of trying to write the
53:08 - code in here is going to be so
53:10 - incredibly awkward like how am I going
53:13 - to really develop because I can't really
53:15 - have line breaks or spaces very easily
53:17 - here so there is a strategy that is used
53:20 - quite often pause for a second just I'm
53:30 - thinking about where I'm going with this
53:34 - this is helpful so far what if I missed
53:40 - here okay so yeah alright I'm thinking
53:50 - all right I don't think I know what I'm
53:52 - going to do so the next step that I want
53:58 - to show you is how could I write all of
54:01 - my bookmarklet code in a separate
54:04 - javascript file and then simply point to
54:09 - it from here so in other words what I
54:11 - want to say is new file I'm just gonna
54:16 - call it book mark clipped J s and then
54:21 - what I want to do is I want to be able
54:22 - to write the bookmarklet in a way that's
54:25 - much like easier for me to follow and
54:27 - debug so for example something that I
54:30 - might do is I might say you know
54:34 - console.log bookmarklet starting and
54:37 - then I might say and now I don't have
54:40 - access to there is a way to gain access
54:42 - to JavaScript libraries like I could
54:45 - have jQuery or p5 be a part of what I'm
54:47 - doing but I'm gonna just do stuff with
54:49 - native JavaScript so I could say for
54:51 - example you know let P paragraphs equal
54:58 - equal document get elements by tag name
55:02 - us P and then I could say for
55:07 - [Music]
55:09 - let I equals 0 eyes less in paragraphs
55:15 - length I plus plus and I could say
55:18 - paragraphs index i dot inner HTML equals
55:23 - so this is me like kind of doing a
55:25 - little version of the deletion esther
55:26 - wordless web like we find all the
55:28 - paragraphs on the page and just set
55:30 - their inner HTML to nothing or i could
55:31 - say it's at their inner HTML to kitten
55:34 - so this now if I wanted to I could put
55:37 - all of this into that JavaScript URL and
55:40 - I could like remove all the the I could
55:43 - remove all the white space and probably
55:45 - make it work but what I could do that's
55:47 - a little bit easier is and I'm gonna I'm
55:50 - gonna just type this out on this in this
55:53 - text document for a second
55:56 - down here is I could actually say
56:00 - alright so this is kind of the and I
56:05 - could write that this anonymous function
56:07 - and then what I can do is one of the
56:11 - things you can do in JavaScript is add
56:13 - elements to the web page and so the
56:16 - element that I want to add is a script
56:17 - so I'm gonna say let script equal
56:20 - document dot create element script and
56:27 - then what I want to do is I want to add
56:30 - to change the source script source equal
56:34 - to book mark lit AAS so I want the
56:42 - source to point to this other JavaScript
56:45 - file and then I want to say
56:48 - document.body.appendchild script so in
56:53 - other words this is kind of some
56:55 - boilerplate code that can basically say
56:58 - any I this just a point to a different
57:01 - javascript file that's going to have all
57:03 - this other stuff and it tons and tons of
57:05 - code and then just load that and execute
57:08 - that code whenever the bookmarklet is is
57:11 - trigger so this is actually what I want
57:15 - to to get this right hopefully I got
57:17 - this right this is what I want to go in
57:21 - here and this is gonna be a little
57:25 - tricky to make happen actually what I'm
57:26 - gonna do
57:27 - I'm going to do this here is now what
57:29 - I'm gonna do is I'm going to just put
57:31 - this all on one line there might be a
57:35 - way for it to account for line breaks
57:37 - and stuff so I'm gonna take this now and
57:40 - I'm gonna put it in here let's see this
57:48 - is really gonna work I didn't close the
57:50 - paragraph tag so let's see what happens
57:54 - here so I am now going to refresh this
57:57 - page I'm going to delete this one up
58:01 - here so you can see that I am going to
58:04 - I'm just gonna like click this okay air
58:09 - for for file not found so I think
58:12 - there's a locate so there's a little bit
58:14 - of an issue here which is that and I'm
58:16 - gonna get to this it you actually need
58:18 - to host your JavaScript file somewhere
58:20 - and I have one that I already made and
58:22 - hosted somewhere let's see if I can get
58:24 - the one that I so this this won't really
58:26 - work in a sustainable way but what I can
58:28 - do I wonder if it doesn't like the
58:30 - whitespace either but I think more
58:32 - likely right what I need to do is just
58:35 - say this because what I want to do let's
58:39 - just make sure this is the right URL for
58:41 - that JavaScript code it is there's that
58:45 - JavaScript code of that URL so that that
58:50 - should allow it to point to the actual
58:52 - URL where that JavaScript code is hosted
58:56 - now what I'm gonna do is click this okay
59:06 - [Music]
59:11 - I'm gonna check this out I'm to check
59:15 - that don't get lost in a bookmarklet for
59:18 - the whole yeah script out yes or mean
59:21 - dot yes shoot I should just go for the a
59:25 - pre-made example that I made but now I
59:27 - kind of want to know why this isn't
59:28 - working
59:28 - Oh does it need to be double quotes I
59:35 - mean it can't be that it needs
59:43 - now that shouldn't matter cuz it's just
59:45 - JavaScript code is it possible that the
59:48 - whitespace is kind of like no it needs
59:50 - the whitespace anybody see what I've
59:58 - done wrong here let me let me go back
60:01 - again
60:13 - oh yeah oh wait a sec yeah look at that
60:22 - oh oh I know what's wrong oops
60:27 - I made a really silly error I completely
60:30 - forgot that I need to have this say
60:32 - JavaScript at the beginning just
60:34 - miscellaneous JavaScript code in that
60:37 - URL is not going to do any good so this
60:40 - has to say JavaScript sorry about that
60:42 - okay let's so let's try this one more
60:46 - time I'm gonna put this up here I'm
60:49 - gonna click this Oh ping get an error
60:52 - uncaught unexpected end of input
60:54 - so where is this error now I probably
60:57 - this is hard debugging is hard
60:59 - especially where the bookmarklet where
61:01 - did this error come from it could have
61:02 - come either in this code here or in this
61:09 - code here so here's the thing let's
61:14 - [Music]
61:17 - let's let's look let's look at this and
61:24 - see if I can see an error oh look at
61:27 - that
61:28 - no double quote double quote that's fine
61:30 - script so one thing we can try to do is
61:44 - yeah I forgot the JavaScript : them you
61:46 - guys are behind me now I have something
61:48 - else where why won't it give me
61:50 - unexpected end of input let's let's I
61:54 - have an idea let's try commenting out
61:57 - this so syntax er can't be there and
62:05 - maybe I can go can I change it to no oh
62:14 - that's an air oh it doesn't like that
62:17 - white space there look at that so by the
62:19 - way I was able to look at this to get
62:22 - some air here so that white space we
62:24 - need to get rid of the unnecessary white
62:26 - space I think so let me see here boy
62:30 - this is rough see this is the thing we
62:33 - do a Chrome extension and before have
62:35 - all these problems
62:36 - let me try doing this let's see if
62:39 - there's any other unnecessary whitespace
62:43 - oh let's see I think this they have to
62:53 - have white space here so let's try this
62:56 - now
63:02 - oh no something else is wrong
63:17 - debugging is hard so what's wrong here
63:24 - document that create element script
63:27 - script that source equals this maybe it
63:34 - wants double quotes everywhere what's
63:36 - not using single quotes let's try that
63:40 - oh yeah I have look at this syntax
63:48 - highlighting why's something is going on
63:51 - that's weird
63:53 - let's try this
64:02 - mm only thing I want to do is clear
64:07 - browsing data oh I don't know no can i
64:21 - these quotes these quotes should be how
64:25 - they all have to be single quotes right
64:29 - because they're within the double quotes
64:35 - how did I do it yeah that's definitely
64:38 - the problem there we go
64:43 - I'm not getting the error anymore but
64:48 - and this okay hi I'm back I don't know
64:54 - when that edit point what happened but I
64:57 - got stuck for a while because it what so
65:00 - this is extra tricky and it won't be as
65:01 - much of an issue in a Chrome extension
65:02 - but because all this JavaScript code is
65:06 - within double quotes as part of the URL
65:09 - path for the a href element I've got to
65:13 - make sure I use single quotes in
65:15 - internally inside otherwise it's going
65:19 - to get completely confused maybe I could
65:20 - escape the quotes but it wasn't working
65:22 - so let's now let's oh I was debugging I
65:28 - kind of comment to stuff out so I'm
65:29 - putting everything back and I'm going to
65:32 - now refresh this page and I'm going to
65:35 - click on the bookmarklet and Oh kidding
65:40 - I did it it said kitten yay so let's
65:45 - delete this and I'm going to refresh
65:50 - this page why is this computer so
65:53 - unbelievably slow
65:59 - hold on a sec you took up I think
66:04 - something crashed I think I might have
66:07 - liked hold on time out for a second
66:09 - again
66:18 - yeah this is there's something crazy
66:19 - about this right oh yeah I don't know
66:23 - okay I don't know why I didn't work a
66:26 - second ago alright so let's try it now
66:30 - I'm gonna click on this bookmarklet and
66:32 - it made a kitten and we see the
66:34 - console.log perfect so what I can do is
66:36 - I can now drag this up to here
66:39 - I could go to like my tutorial page I'm
66:42 - now on my tutorial page I'm gonna scroll
66:44 - to the middle somewhere where there's a
66:45 - bunch of paragraphs I'm gonna click the
66:46 - bookmarklet and all the paragraphs now
66:49 - say kitten yes so this is the basic idea
66:52 - of making a bookmarklet what you need to
66:54 - do and it's obviously a little trickier
66:56 - than I thought and you can see actually
66:57 - I actually just copy pasted the code for
66:59 - my tutorial but here it is right here I
67:02 - can just basically all I need to do is
67:05 - have this boilerplate code that points
67:11 - to a JavaScript program that's hosted
67:14 - somewhere and then what it does is that
67:19 - JavaScript program does something parses
67:21 - the web page changes them stuff anything
67:23 - is possible there now there's a couple
67:25 - things I want to mention about this
67:26 - browsers browsers love love love love
67:29 - love to cache your stuff so if I don't
67:33 - know if we're gonna if this is gonna
67:35 - happen but let's see if we can make this
67:36 - happen if I change this now to say puppy
67:41 - right and I go back to and refresh this
67:45 - page and click the bookmarklet it does
67:48 - say puppy so it worked but I've
67:50 - definitely been in a situation where I
67:52 - changed the code and the bookmarklet did
67:55 - it actually update when it when I when I
67:58 - executed it so a way that you can get
68:00 - around this I actually have it here in
68:03 - this tutorial so I'll just come is is to
68:05 - add a kind of arbitrary URL argument
68:09 - which is like the current date and time
68:13 - which will force it'll make the URL
68:15 - appear different to the page that's
68:17 - loading the JavaScript code and it'll
68:18 - force it to reload so I'm gonna leave
68:20 - that out of adding that in but you can
68:22 - when I publish the code for this example
68:24 - I'll include that
68:26 - as part of the code now
68:29 - what I've shown you so far it doesn't
68:30 - really do you any good what I least what
68:33 - I'm going to do is I'm going to show you
68:34 - this is actually a piece of JavaScript
68:39 - code that's basically the same thing
68:40 - that just takes all the paragraphs and
68:42 - changes their background color to some
68:44 - purple so the way that you really want
68:48 - to do this is you want to host your
68:49 - JavaScript code somewhere permanent and
68:51 - then what you want is for the
68:54 - bookmarklet to reference not like
68:58 - referencing localhost is no good it's
68:59 - gonna work on my computer but you want
69:01 - to reference a URL that's actually out
69:03 - there somewhere in the cloud the nice
69:05 - thing about this is as people use your
69:08 - bookmarklet I mean there's a there is a
69:10 - sort of security question here you can
69:12 - change your bookmarklets code and they
69:14 - don't have to reinstall it because the
69:17 - the actual code that they have in the
69:19 - book market is just pointing to another
69:20 - javascript file and that javascript file
69:22 - can be updated okay so maybe I'll come
69:24 - back and do a coding challenge oh but
69:25 - but so sending your creative
69:27 - bookmarklets that change images the
69:29 - kittens or puppies or rainbows and
69:31 - unicorns or whatever and all sorts of
69:34 - unserved more creative ideas than what I
69:35 - can think of right now but I'm gonna now
69:37 - move into Chrome extensions we can do
69:40 - I'm going to start by making a Chrome
69:42 - extension that does exactly the same
69:44 - thing but with this kind of code that
69:46 - alters your view of a web page in a
69:48 - Chrome extension there's going to be a
69:50 - lot more possibilities what you can do
69:52 - beyond that okay so thanks for watching
69:53 - this bookmarklet tutorial and I'll see
69:56 - you in the next one yeah everyone's
70:07 - telling me about the quote stuff all
70:09 - right so it's my hair green is my hair
70:12 - looking green today it's probably just
70:14 - because this is a what's behind me is a
70:18 - green oh you can't see that is a green
70:20 - screen but I'm keyed out alright how is
70:24 - that how what am i doing on time wise
70:26 - eleven forty okay I don't know I didn't
70:30 - intend for it to be so much debugging
70:31 - all right
70:37 - so I'm gonna now make a Chrome extension
70:42 - whoops
70:44 - call it basics and we don't need this
70:53 - anymore okay
71:09 - yeah them I'm looking at so fly our
71:12 - anonymous s why don't you look at this
71:14 - chat I do look at it periodically it's
71:16 - very hard for me to go through a
71:18 - tutorial while reading a chat the
71:21 - concentrate though I am kind of
71:23 - scatterbrained and make lots of mistakes
71:25 - and also yeah you've solved all the bits
71:31 - there's generally like I appreciate how
71:35 - helpful that you had all the problems
71:36 - but often it Scrolls really fast and I
71:39 - can't read it and sometimes things that
71:41 - people post in the chat are not the
71:43 - correct answer
71:44 - and are troubling me yeah I've had that
71:46 - experience which gets me off on another
71:48 - so I try to say glued to the slack chat
71:50 - which is part of the patron group to try
71:52 - to see but yes I thank you I will try to
71:56 - do a better job of keeping an eye on the
71:59 - chat I aspire to be reading the chat
72:01 - while it's going but I also part of
72:05 - people's learning I hope maybe while
72:08 - watching the videos is seeing my own
72:10 - debugging process as painful as that can
72:12 - be to watch alright so I want to keep
72:16 - moving on here
72:20 - Oh WebGL stuff yes I want to get to that
72:23 - is that on the schedule if it's not
72:24 - somebody remind me because there are a
72:26 - lot of great new WebGL stuff in p5 that
72:28 - I can cover okay let's see here I wish I
72:35 - had some water next time let's go back
72:40 - to here oops
72:45 - so we're now going to start actually
72:47 - doing a Chrome extension this isn't
72:52 - working here we go oh this is off okay
73:02 - all right so how to besides having you
73:08 - watch me erase this is I want to talk
73:11 - about Chrome extensions and I guess the
73:13 - anatomy of a Chrome extension I'm going
73:15 - to start with the most basic kind of
73:17 - Chrome extension you can possibly do so
73:20 - first of all again let's think about
73:23 - this diagram this is the Chrome browser
73:28 - maybe there is there's a toolbar there's
73:31 - an address bar there's a whole lot of
73:33 - elements here all of these elements are
73:35 - things we can control manipulate and
73:37 - play around with as part of making a
73:39 - Chrome extension but I'm going to start
73:41 - with a sort of basic idea of affecting
73:44 - the actual content so for any Chrome
73:50 - extension that you make the first thing
73:53 - that you have to have is something
73:55 - called a manifest file manifest dot JSON
74:02 - so this is the first thing that you need
74:04 - this is a file that has all the
74:07 - configuration properties and information
74:10 - about your Chrome extension so that's
74:13 - let's go first make a manifest a JSON
74:15 - file
74:16 - alright so I'm gonna go to Adam I'm
74:19 - going to make a new file I'm gonna call
74:22 - it manifest JSON and so this is just a
74:26 - sorry I lost my train of thought um this
74:29 - is just a sorry this is just a JSON file
74:32 - so and it's going to have its kind of
74:34 - like if you've ever made work with no
74:36 - dot Jaso you need a package that JSON
74:38 - file that describes your project so
74:40 - there's a couple things that I need in
74:41 - here I need to say manifest version 2
74:46 - and so I think there's different
74:48 - versions of like the Chrome extension
74:49 - API stuff and there was an older one
74:52 - maybe there's even a new or one but two
74:54 - is the one that I use and it works I can
74:57 - give it a name
74:59 - like coding train extension I can give
75:07 - it like a version which is just my
75:09 - made-up thing like oh it's virgin
75:12 - 0.001 and yes so that's let's actually
75:17 - just start with that okay so let's start
75:21 - with that so this is first what I need I
75:24 - need to have this kind of configuration
75:25 - file now there are a variety of kinds of
75:30 - Chrome extensions you can make we've
75:32 - mentioned this one that overrides the
75:34 - new tab page the first there's there's
75:38 - ones that add buttons to the interface
75:40 - there's browser actions papers all sort
75:42 - of things I'm gonna get to all that
75:43 - stuff the first thing that I want to add
75:46 - to my Chrome extension is something
75:48 - called a Content script and a con if you
75:53 - watched my previous bookmarklet video
75:55 - the content script is basically exactly
75:58 - the same thing that I did in the
76:00 - bookmarklet it's JavaScript code that
76:02 - will execute when the page loads and you
76:05 - can after the whole page is loaded and
76:08 - finished manipulate and draw and do
76:11 - things and alter the behavior and
76:13 - content of the web page work early on
76:15 - this is a very powerful thing for
76:16 - example let's say you want to make a
76:20 - Chrome extension that for anybody
76:21 - browsing the New York Times it swaps out
76:25 - any time the word computer appears with
76:28 - the word flower so if you wanted to do
76:32 - this project without a Chrome extension
76:34 - how would you do it oh maybe you'd have
76:36 - to create a whole fake website that kind
76:38 - of looks like the New York Times or you
76:39 - would load it and then you would are you
76:41 - would copy you've jumped through all
76:42 - these hoops to cry to create that
76:43 - illusion the Chrome extension is a
76:45 - program at least a Content script is a
76:48 - program that executes that runs for any
76:51 - given web page that the browser is
76:53 - currently on and you can say a lot of
76:54 - stuff like only for these URLs only for
76:57 - this you know you can know which tab
76:58 - you're on there's lots of possibilities
77:00 - there so this is the first thing that I
77:01 - want to add then a Content script can
77:03 - have a bunch of things associated with
77:04 - it but I'm going to associate with it
77:07 - just one thing which is a JavaScript
77:09 - file
77:10 - content j/s so before we can start
77:12 - writing that javascript code we need to
77:15 - add tell the manifest.json file about
77:18 - this content script so let's add that so
77:22 - I think I say I might be getting some of
77:24 - this stuff wrong I think I say content
77:28 - scripts because there could be more than
77:30 - one and then that's an array and then I
77:34 - think I said do I say JavaScript wait
77:37 - and it's another it's an array of
77:38 - objects and I think I said no I think I
77:41 - CJ s and then I could say like content J
77:45 - s so for example here is this Chrome
77:49 - extension now has a Content script
77:51 - called that is where all the code for
77:55 - this content script is in this
77:56 - JavaScript file I have to make that
77:57 - JavaScript file now content J s and all
78:03 - I'm gonna do is put console dot log you
78:06 - know Chrome extension ready to go whoa
78:10 - what did I just chrome Chrome extension
78:15 - go okay so I'm just going to put a
78:17 - console log in the in the content script
78:20 - now I am missing a kind of key component
78:23 - here which is that by definition a
78:25 - Chrome extension runs based on sorry
78:32 - turn the camera back on
78:39 - the Chrome extension runs first checks
78:44 - the URL that the current of the current
78:46 - page and then decides whether to run or
78:48 - not so one of things that I can add to
78:50 - this I believe is matches and that's
78:57 - also an array and then so I could put
79:01 - things in here like you know anytime I
79:04 - want the New York Times and you can I
79:06 - don't know if you can use a full regular
79:07 - expression in here but you can
79:08 - definitely use wildcards but I'm just
79:10 - gonna do I think it's all URLs so this
79:14 - is this should be what you put in if you
79:18 - want your Chrome extension to run on all
79:20 - URLs so we are by the way we're done
79:22 - we've actually made our first Chrome
79:24 - extension the only thing we need is the
79:26 - manifest.json file that describes the
79:29 - Chrome extension and we need the content
79:32 - dot J's file which is the we actually
79:34 - don't need that but if I want to just do
79:36 - the basic one that is a Content script
79:39 - that's what we need so let's see now
79:41 - here's the question like oh my goodness
79:42 - how do we get this to run do I run a
79:44 - local server and I open up the JSON file
79:46 - in the browser No
79:47 - so this is a this is a interesting it's
79:50 - actually quite simple to do but what I
79:52 - want to do is go to Chrome oh yeah so by
79:57 - the way so I can go to HTTP to look at
80:00 - URLs I can look at things on the file
80:02 - path in my in my previous bookmarklet
80:05 - videos I showed how you could go to like
80:07 - a JavaScript path to execute JavaScript
80:09 - code but a lot of things for Chrome you
80:12 - can get to like the version settings all
80:15 - that kind of thing through the URL
80:16 - address bar this is called by the way I
80:19 - think the omnibox I think because
80:21 - there's actually you can one of the
80:23 - things you could do with a Chrome
80:24 - extension is you can start to provide
80:26 - suggestions and make things happen based
80:28 - on people type in the omnibox but I'm
80:31 - just gonna go to extensions oh shoot
80:36 - hold on Matt's here this is gonna be a
80:39 - little edit points because I don't want
80:41 - that to be clicked shoot taurine I'm not
80:45 - gonna have that it's not gonna match I'm
80:46 - not gonna have the right zoom but
80:49 - I'm gonna go to Chrome extensions and
80:54 - you could see here so here's here's my
80:57 - Chrome extensions page I only have one
81:00 - Chrome extension installed JSON format
81:02 - or I can enable it or disable it one
81:05 - thing you can see here is permissions so
81:07 - all Chrome extensions have permission to
81:09 - do certain things this one allows is
81:11 - allowed to read and change all the data
81:12 - and all the websites so hope you visit
81:14 - that sounds very very scary but
81:16 - ultimately you should be I might have to
81:25 - take a break by the way in a second to
81:26 - go get some water the one day that I
81:28 - forgot to get water is the day that I
81:30 - still have this like sore throat so let
81:32 - me let me keep going here so it says it
81:34 - can read and change all of your data on
81:36 - the websites you visit this is actually
81:37 - the basic permissions for a Content
81:40 - script that's what content scripts are
81:41 - allowed to do read and change all the
81:43 - data on the websites you visit so Chrome
81:44 - extensions are really something you have
81:45 - to opt-in to and there all sorts of
81:47 - security and privacy questions that come
81:50 - with them but we're just experimenting
81:52 - playing around and where you want to
81:53 - make Chrome extensions just to run on
81:55 - this laptop here not to be necessarily
81:57 - released to the chrome store so how do I
81:59 - do that if I want to install run the
82:03 - Chrome extension code that I made I've
82:04 - got to go over here and first click
82:06 - developer mode and what you see now is
82:09 - that this miss these options now appear
82:13 - load unpacked extension pack extension
82:16 - the unpacked extension is just the raw
82:18 - code manifest that JSON the content
82:21 - touch is pack extension is then a thing
82:23 - I could do to like package it all into a
82:25 - single file to deploy it to the chrome
82:27 - store but again that's kind of beyond
82:28 - the scope of what I'm doing at least in
82:30 - this video it's really maybe in all the
82:31 - videos so i'm gonna click load unpacked
82:33 - extension i'm gonna navigate to the
82:35 - desktop i'm gonna go to my folder called
82:37 - chrome extensions i'm gonna go to this
82:39 - one called basics which is where i have
82:41 - those files and i'm gonna hit select and
82:44 - now we might find out that i might have
82:46 - made a mistake i might get an error
82:47 - let's see so excellent i got an error
82:51 - loading an extension so this is what
82:53 - happens when you incorrectly format your
82:57 - manifest.json file so i'm gonna have to
83:00 - look i'm sure somebody in the chat
83:01 - is already telling me what I got wrong
83:04 - but I am going to I'm gonna try to look
83:08 - and see what it is so let me go here to
83:10 - manifest.json I probably could just go
83:14 - to my tutorial I'm looking for a syntax
83:16 - error oh I know what it is the
83:24 - JavaScript files associated with a
83:26 - particular content script can be more
83:28 - than one javascript file in fact you can
83:31 - actually put like if I wanted to use
83:32 - jQuery as part of my content script I
83:35 - could actually put other library files
83:37 - or p5 library files in this so that
83:39 - needs to be an array and actually I
83:41 - should have had a clue to that because
83:42 - with saying here content scripts index 0
83:45 - is invalid so this has to be an array so
83:48 - let's let me hit save and then I should
83:51 - be able hit retry boom we're great so we
83:54 - see coding train extension version 0.1
83:57 - didn't I say it was version 0.01
84:00 - shouldn't that be it's version version
84:02 - 2.0 yeah okay so for whatever reason it
84:07 - probably doesn't want let you do
84:09 - anything less than one decimal place
84:11 - version one
84:13 - I can check permissions which is that
84:16 - yes it can read it as a Content script
84:18 - so it can read and change all of your
84:20 - data on the websites you visit and it's
84:23 - running I could allow it to run
84:24 - incognito or not etc so it's enabled so
84:28 - here we go now I'm just gonna I'm gonna
84:30 - open up my console and I'm going to go
84:34 - to any webpage like my tutorial and hit
84:36 - refresh Chrome extension go so you can
84:39 - see that Chrome extension is going no
84:41 - matter what website i go to i go to
84:43 - google.com Chrome extension go so that
84:47 - code now with that Chrome extension
84:49 - installed runs for any web page that I'm
84:52 - on so now I can start to change whatever
84:55 - I want so let's let's do something
84:57 - similar to what I did with the
84:58 - bookmarklet I can say something like let
85:01 - paragraphs equal document dot document
85:05 - get elements by tag name you know I'm
85:09 - just trying to think of something simple
85:11 - to do I can oh let me try using one of
85:14 - these new
85:15 - let me try using one of these new es6
85:18 - loops
85:18 - why not this video randomly so I think I
85:21 - could say for element like element of
85:23 - paragraphs I think this is a new es6
85:26 - loop which so what I'm what I'm doing
85:28 - why am i covering this in the middle of
85:30 - this video I'll never know why I just
85:31 - decided to do this but instead of
85:33 - iterating over with I I can just say
85:34 - paragraphs is in it is an array and I
85:37 - want to look at each element of the
85:38 - array so let's see if I get this right
85:41 - and I'm going to say element dot style
85:48 - background color equals you know some
85:56 - color so let's see now if we now here's
86:00 - the thing I'm gonna go back to this page
86:02 - and I'm gonna get this is where there's
86:04 - some paragraphs and I'm gonna hit
86:05 - refresh nothing happened okay let me
86:09 - make sure let me debug this write Chrome
86:12 - extension go Chrome extension go
86:14 - question mark I should see the new
86:17 - message right now I'm gonna go back and
86:19 - hit refresh mmm there's no question mark
86:23 - there so just as Chrome extension go so
86:25 - here's one of the things you it's really
86:26 - hard to remember but you have to
86:27 - remember when you change the code you've
86:30 - got to go back here and click reload
86:32 - you've got to ask the Chrome extensions
86:36 - page to reload the source code from that
86:39 - unpack extension from that folder
86:40 - so I'm gonna hit reload and then I'm
86:44 - going to sorry I'm gonna go back to here
86:47 - and I'm gonna do this well we can see
86:49 - there it does this Chrome extension no
86:52 - matter what page I'm on i don't know
86:54 - i'll go to the IMA website for ITP
86:58 - right you can see it's made all the
87:00 - paragraphs pink on this page so so ah so
87:07 - this is pretty much this is done at
87:08 - least this first video what i wanted to
87:10 - show you is what are the pieces of a
87:12 - Chrome extension well one thing you can
87:13 - do with a chrome extension is alter the
87:16 - content of the web page or alter the
87:18 - behavior right JavaScript code now it's
87:20 - really important to realize something
87:21 - that I didn't mention explicitly which i
87:23 - think is important to realize is if you
87:26 - look at the code there's no
87:29 - you know like in p5 you have to put
87:31 - stuff in function setup or in you know
87:36 - maybe there's like window dot onload or
87:38 - in jQuery there's some kind of like
87:39 - ready with a dollar sign or something
87:41 - crazy like that typically you want to
87:44 - execute your JavaScript code after the
87:46 - web page has loaded so you need an event
87:48 - the web page is loaded execute this code
87:50 - a by definition the content script does
87:54 - not run until the page is already loaded
87:57 - so anything you put in here will run
87:59 - after the page is loaded and if you only
88:01 - want this to run for example if I'm on
88:04 - let's match each let's match can I do
88:09 - like star shift min star let's try this
88:11 - I'm gonna match any URL that has
88:13 - Schiffman in it so I'm gonna have to
88:17 - let's let's reload the extension oh it
88:23 - didn't like that missing scheme
88:26 - separator how do i how do i do the
88:33 - matching oh I know okay so let's just
88:42 - try this whoops
88:50 - no whoops hold on
88:54 - so I'm this is going to be added point
88:57 - I'm gonna have to go back to this what's
89:05 - wrong about mine Oh does it have to be
89:07 - inside of like no matter what it has to
89:10 - be like inside of this I don't know
89:13 - well look at the chat see now chat where
89:16 - are you saving me here there's this what
89:28 - I need to do No
89:32 - all right have an example that does this
89:35 - correctly oops all these examples basics
89:48 - page
89:56 - oh this looks like what did I do wrong
90:01 - here
90:15 - so there's I guess there's a oriental
90:17 - let me okay thank you me IM sami so let
90:27 - me come back
90:36 - I can also have the Chrome extension
90:38 - work for just a particular webpage
90:41 - there's a specific syntax to what you're
90:43 - allowed to put in matches and I'm often
90:45 - getting it wrong in fact there's a
90:46 - little edit point there because I just
90:47 - had some trouble figuring it out so me I
90:49 - am sue me and the chat just gave me a
90:51 - good suggestion so you can use wildcards
90:54 - so I think like this would basically say
90:57 - like any URL with Schiffman in it or
91:01 - like for example any URL with github in
91:03 - it let's just be I'm gonna be a little
91:04 - so that that probably works but I'm
91:06 - gonna just also show you like I can say
91:08 - like I can say like any Schiffman dotnet
91:12 - page whether it is so one thing I could
91:15 - do is like this whether it's HTTP or
91:16 - HTTPS I'm pretty sure this will work so
91:19 - now this content script will only
91:21 - execute on those pages so I'm gonna hit
91:24 - reload uh-oh there's a comma there wait
91:28 - should be a comma in there oh no there
91:29 - shouldn't be a comma here that's the
91:31 - last element of the array so retry there
91:34 - we go and now if I go to here whoops
91:37 - refresh still making everything pink but
91:40 - if I go to the ITP ima website we can
91:43 - see nothing is now pink so it's only
91:47 - it's only changing the it's only running
91:51 - this content script for those URLs and
91:53 - interesting enough notice how content
91:54 - scripts is an array so I can have
91:55 - certain content scripts for certain URLs
91:57 - and certain kind of script for other
91:59 - URLs all within the same extension so
92:01 - this is can become a much larger project
92:04 - with all sorts of permutations but this
92:06 - is the very basic idea okay so what I've
92:09 - shown you so far is the basic anatomy of
92:12 - a Chrome extension manifest file if you
92:15 - want to have a Content not all promise
92:17 - engines need content scripts but it's a
92:18 - good place to start
92:19 - content script what URLs that you want
92:22 - to match what's your JavaScript code
92:23 - what I haven't done is shown you
92:26 - anything about how to actually think
92:29 - about the browsing experience beyond
92:31 - just the actual web page you're on so
92:33 - for example what if I want to know when
92:36 - the user is typing here or what if I
92:38 - want to know when the user opens a new
92:40 - tab or what if I want to add a button to
92:42 - over there over there that I designed
92:45 - myself that when the user pressed
92:47 - that button it shows them all the it
92:50 - shows them every time we're the word
92:52 - kitten appears on the webpage by a with
92:54 - a count or something like a terrible
92:56 - example so this is what I'm going to do
92:58 - next and the thing that I need for that
93:00 - which I will do in the next video is
93:02 - what's called a background script a
93:05 - Content script is a script that just
93:07 - runs execute after a given web page
93:10 - loads a background script in a way as a
93:12 - script that's kind of always running in
93:14 - the background listening to all of the
93:17 - events the entire experience of using
93:20 - the chrome software and that's what I'll
93:22 - show you in the next video all right
93:31 - okay how are we doing everybody
93:33 - um can you oh I don't have a lot of time
93:37 - you know what I was gonna I was gonna
93:39 - take a break to just go get some water
93:41 - and use the restroom but I do have to
93:43 - leave at 12:30 so to be honest with
93:46 - twenty minutes like I can go for another
93:48 - 20 minutes I think I'll be fine
93:51 - and I want to do there was a short sound
93:53 - glitch so hold on time out did anybody
93:57 - hear that
94:05 - get why wait gastro in the chat asks
94:07 - have you ever been beardless yes I don't
94:11 - know many many a dad maybe a time all
94:15 - right was it during was it during the
94:19 - part of the tutorial that I just did or
94:24 - redo okay when was it just in this no
94:30 - whatever you're hearing record exactly
94:32 - to the disc it's the same there's no
94:34 - difference so it was when I was over
94:39 - here talking about the background script
94:41 - oh I'm not over there now it was on my
94:46 - ending no wait board time okay alright
94:50 - so let me try that one more time I don't
94:52 - remember where at what I started with
94:54 - background script okay what did I start
95:04 - by saying over there how you know if it
95:10 - wasn't so bad I don't really care so
95:12 - much but I'll just restate what I said
95:15 - before okay so what I all I've shown you
95:18 - so far is that in a Content script with
95:22 - a Chrome extension with a Content script
95:23 - you can manipulate the behavior and
95:26 - content of the web page that you are
95:28 - currently browser the user is currently
95:30 - browsing but a Chrome extension we can
95:33 - actually listen to and think about the
95:35 - browsing experience as a whole so what
95:38 - if I want they sell this stuff over
95:40 - there if I want to add a button or no
95:43 - when a user is typing what the way that
95:45 - that is done is by adding something
95:48 - called the way that's done is by adding
95:54 - something called a background script so
95:57 - a Chrome extension can have a background
95:59 - script content script executes for every
96:02 - web web page that matches the URL after
96:05 - it's loaded the background script is
96:06 - actually a thing that runs as soon as
96:08 - you launch Chrome and it's always there
96:10 - listening for all of the events of the
96:12 - things you might be doing in
96:13 - are you opening a new tab or are you
96:16 - pressing a button on the interface you
96:18 - typing in the address bar so this is
96:20 - going to unlock a lot of other kinds of
96:22 - possibilities and it's what I will show
96:24 - you in the next video whatever it was a
96:30 - minor blip maybe the first Mattia you
96:33 - don't need to you don't need to include
96:36 - the second one if it's fine
96:38 - whatever I did first made more sense
96:40 - okay so I'm gonna try to do a video with
96:43 - a background script now before I can do
96:46 - that all right who on the Internet can
96:52 - very quickly
96:53 - tweet-tweet at the coding train a little
96:58 - coding train icon that I can put here as
97:02 - a button like so I want something to
97:05 - appear here that's not just that's not
97:10 - just the default thing so I need like a
97:12 - probably like a 64 by 64 PNG I bet you I
97:16 - can make one myself faster than I think
97:18 - coding train store Envy Oh anyway no no
97:24 - well if I go to sticker mule coding
97:28 - train hey what's this is this somebody
97:38 - else or no this is just no this is me so
97:43 - let me grab this baby and save image as
97:51 - what might make me
97:52 - PNG there we go and let me open this up
98:04 - right this is refined
98:07 - this should work okay so actually never
98:10 - mind never mind I think I got I think I
98:13 - got one so I just don't remember how
98:17 - okay browser action I think okay great
98:25 - so what I'm going to do now is I'm going
98:27 - to delete this one Simon had a good
98:32 - suggestion which is to number this stuff
98:34 - which i think is always helpful starting
98:43 - with zero sure and this actually should
98:49 - just be content script it's not really
98:51 - basics and then two is going to be
98:58 - background scripts can I do this in time
99:08 - don't save
99:16 - boy I love this new es6 loop I'm going
99:19 - to be using that a lot
99:23 - so we'll just want to change this back
99:25 - to all URLs and okay
99:39 - okay here we go
99:49 - alright I'm back for a second Chrome
99:52 - extension video and I'm gonna pick up
99:54 - right where I left off which is I want
99:56 - to add something called a background
99:59 - script now the truth of the matter is a
100:04 - background script can do a lot of things
100:05 - it's the content script I'm saying what
100:08 - I just said at the end of the last video
100:09 - but to repeat myself the content script
100:11 - is code that executes after a webpage
100:14 - loads that you can effect and manipulate
100:18 - and work with the actual content of the
100:20 - web page itself a background script is a
100:24 - script that loads when you launch chrome
100:26 - and it's listening for events associated
100:29 - with the activity of using the Chrome
100:31 - browser as a piece of software itself so
100:34 - one of the things I could do in a
100:36 - background script is I can listen for
100:38 - things called a browser action there's
100:40 - also a page action there's all sorts of
100:41 - kinds of events but a browser action is
100:44 - actually a way of listening for it for
100:47 - example I can add a button to the menu
100:49 - bar with my own design and I can listen
100:52 - in the background script which I'm gonna
100:54 - call background j/s I can listen for
100:58 - when the user has clicked that button
100:59 - and then I can make something happen
101:01 - potentially on the web page or I could
101:03 - make something happen within chrome like
101:05 - close all the tabs or something like
101:07 - that lots of things are possible so what
101:09 - I want to do in this video is show you
101:11 - instead of having the previous video I
101:13 - made a Content script that runs
101:15 - immediately when you load the page
101:16 - instead what I'm gonna do now is have a
101:18 - background script that has a button and
101:21 - when you press the button it causes the
101:23 - content script to run so it doesn't run
101:25 - immediately but only when you press the
101:27 - button alright so let's see if we can
101:28 - make that happen
101:29 - so the first thing I need to do is tell
101:31 - manifest.json about the background
101:34 - script ok tell manifest.json oh so I
101:40 - think I need comma background can I have
101:45 - more than one background script I think
101:47 - actually just say background right
101:51 - somebody will correct me and then is
101:54 - that an array it's an array no it's it's
101:58 - you can't so unlike content scripts I
102:00 - think you could have multiple content
102:01 - scripts a background script
102:03 - one background script you get a multiple
102:05 - background scripts per attend it per
102:07 - extension you have multiple JavaScript
102:08 - files associated with the background
102:09 - script but just one so this is just an
102:11 - object with J with the J s property and
102:15 - I'm gonna call that background a s okay
102:23 - I think this is good so now I need to
102:25 - create that javascript file background j
102:30 - s and I'm just gonna put console dot log
102:33 - background running just to have
102:36 - something in there okay so I have this
102:39 - background script now oh this should be
102:40 - an array same problem I forgot before
102:43 - content dot J s this should be an array
102:46 - let's not make that mistake again and
102:48 - now what I'm going to do coding train
102:52 - extension I'm just gonna call this
102:53 - coding training tension - I'm so now I'm
102:56 - gonna load that unpacked extension
102:59 - background script it's in this folder
103:01 - there we go I didn't get any errors
103:04 - Google Chrome cannot prevent extension
103:07 - from recording your browsing history
103:08 - that's it oh I I clicked allowing you to
103:10 - go by accident okay so now this is
103:12 - running alright this is very exciting
103:15 - let's go back to this page and hit
103:18 - refresh content script ran up Chrome
103:23 - extension go oh but where does it say I
103:26 - totally console.log background running
103:29 - how come I don't see background running
103:31 - here so here's the thing shoot here's
103:41 - the thing the content script is a thing
103:45 - that executes inside of the actual web
103:47 - page and so the debug stuff is available
103:50 - in the JavaScript console the background
103:54 - script is running as part of the browser
103:56 - as a whole it does not talk to the get
103:59 - javascript console associated with a
104:00 - given page instead you're gonna have to
104:03 - go back to debug any console logs in the
104:06 - background script in a different place
104:08 - let me show you where that is so what
104:11 - I'm going to do here is now oh sorry I
104:14 - need to go to this page
104:16 - chrome slash lash extensions and then
104:22 - hmm wait a sec interestingly enough
104:27 - maybe because I don't have any sold on
104:30 - second weirdly usually I see then like
104:34 - inspect views background page maybe I
104:38 - don't actually have the right time out
104:40 - for a second
104:43 - anybody see anything wrong here
104:45 - background Jay ask background JJ s
104:53 - [Music]
104:58 - background
104:59 - oh it's scripts okay thank you
105:04 - oops oops oops so what I'm looking for
105:08 - actually what you see down here which is
105:10 - inspect views background page and I
105:12 - don't see that the reason is I got this
105:14 - wrong this should be scripts for content
105:16 - scripts it was js4 background
105:19 - it's scripts whatever this is the
105:22 - specification for how a Chrome extension
105:23 - works let me hit the hole that drama for
105:26 - nothing let me hit reload now same thing
105:29 - I can go here Chrome extension go that
105:33 - that console.log that's in my background
105:36 - script is not appearing in the
105:38 - JavaScript console in the browser but if
105:40 - I go back to the extensions page I now
105:42 - see that it says inspect views I can
105:44 - click there and now I can see here I can
105:48 - look at the JavaScript console for the
105:50 - background script so this is just an
105:52 - important piece debugging is tricky
105:53 - because you got to remember is this part
105:55 - of the background script is as part of
105:56 - the content script where's it all
105:59 - happening okay
106:00 - now let's actually add a browser action
106:05 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to now
106:08 - in the in manifest I'm gonna say browser
106:13 - action : mmm what is it what does it was
106:19 - it was a browser action
106:23 - no I think that's a default icon maybe
106:26 - icon do you fault icon default icon and
106:31 - then I'm gonna give it my coding
106:34 - training PNG so one thing I can
106:36 - reference by the way what I'm not sure
106:40 - if you can have assets and different
106:41 - media things associated with like a
106:43 - Content script and you can add that and
106:45 - we'll get to that I guess at some point
106:46 - with future examples but right now I
106:47 - want to have a browser action and I want
106:50 - the browser action to be associated with
106:52 - a button I need a PNG for that button so
106:53 - did I already put this sorry I have to
106:58 - navigate to this ok so I have this PNG
107:02 - file then I'm gonna put in now into
107:05 - there so you can see here now I have
107:07 - manifest that JSON background digest
107:09 - content itis and I have this PNG file so
107:11 - now if I reload the Chrome extension
107:14 - again we can see look at that all the
107:19 - way up there there's my button now
107:21 - anyway I could design it a lot better
107:23 - it probably has all this that PNG has
107:25 - all this extra but now if I press this
107:28 - button I'm triggering a browser action
107:30 - so I need to listen for that browser
107:34 - action where does the content script
107:39 - listen for the browser action no the
107:41 - content script is sandbox it's Walden it
107:44 - only knows what's happening here so I
107:47 - need the Baraat the background script to
107:50 - listen for when I click the button so
107:52 - let's add a bit of code for that I go to
107:56 - the background script what I add to that
108:00 - is it's I think it's chrome dot browser
108:06 - action dot not clicked on clicked I
108:10 - haven't written up there ah listen her
108:19 - button like you know button I'll just
108:22 - call this button clicked and then I can
108:25 - I can write a function the callback
108:28 - function so let me give you some more
108:30 - room so you can see this they make this
108:32 - little smaller okay and then I can write
108:35 - this function oops
108:44 - can write this I can write this function
108:47 - called button click this is me making up
108:49 - a function now this is my made-up
108:51 - callback it could be an anonymous call
108:52 - back loop there's a camera up here that
108:54 - I just hit it could be an anonymous
108:55 - function written in there but I'm gonna
108:57 - do this in a simple way and I believe
108:58 - and then I could just say console dot
109:02 - log button clicked so let's do that so
109:08 - let's do that and so there is actually a
109:12 - thing that I'm forgetting here which is
109:14 - that well let me just add this first so
109:16 - if I go reload the extension and then I
109:21 - go inspect views and put this over here
109:25 - and I'm gonna click the button now
109:27 - button clicked so you can see above my
109:29 - head here that message is coming out
109:31 - when I click the button so I now have a
109:33 - function that's listening no matter
109:35 - where I am but what if I want to know
109:37 - like oh when I click the button what's
109:39 - the current tab that's open and actually
109:41 - this callback gets an argument which has
109:44 - information about the tap so I'm going
109:46 - to actually just console.log the tab
109:48 - object so we can see I'm going to reload
109:50 - and I'm going to click the button and
109:53 - now we can see look at this so there's
109:56 - all sorts of information that I can now
109:58 - get about the particular tab that I'm on
110:02 - so you really have in the Chrome
110:04 - extension in the background script which
110:06 - is making use by the way this is part of
110:08 - the chrome API right chrome browsers
110:11 - that's not just like available
110:12 - JavaScript code wherever you are but by
110:14 - default at some point need to come back
110:16 - and look at the chrome API reference but
110:18 - this is where I can do things that
110:21 - listen to events okay now what I need to
110:25 - do is tell the content script about it
110:27 - but the content script is stuck
110:31 - inside of its wall it can't reach out
110:35 - and know about this except for the fact
110:37 - that there is a and this doesn't really
110:39 - go in this list I guess if I just other
110:41 - like sort of concepts or api's chrome
110:48 - API so there is we saw there's like a
110:50 - Chrome browser action that's one thing
110:55 - we just saw there's another thing which
110:57 - is some I thought this would be very
111:07 - like I never never done this before good
111:09 - that what is it okay the other thing
111:16 - that I want to look at here is messaging
111:22 - so there's a messaging API there's a way
111:24 - that I can send a message from the
111:30 - background scripted really should go
111:31 - here there's a way I can send a message
111:32 - from the background script to the
111:34 - content script and vice versa so that's
111:36 - where I need to do let's look at how we
111:38 - can do that so oops so what I'm gonna do
111:42 - inside button clicked I'm going to say
111:47 - chrome tabs a send message so this is
111:53 - the this is the jet this is from the
111:57 - Chrome extension API the chrome object
112:00 - there's an object called tabs so I could
112:01 - send a message I think to all tabs
112:03 - actually but what I want to do is just
112:05 - send a message to the particular tab
112:07 - that I'm on so I'm gonna say something
112:09 - like this tab ID right and we can see
112:12 - that where I debug that here ID 95 each
112:15 - tab has an unidentified been for mation
112:38 - going on that you could sent here so let
112:40 - me show you this so I am going to now
112:43 - send this message
112:44 - so once I have this code that's sending
112:46 - a message I need to receive that message
112:48 - and where I receive the message is in
112:50 - the content script so I now need chrome
112:53 - message receiver what is it I have no
112:56 - idea I have it somewhere on the wall
112:58 - where I taped up a lot of it's good ah
113:00 - runtime so there's an event there's a
113:03 - chrome runtime on message this is a
113:06 - particular kind of event when I need to
113:08 - have a listener add listener and and
113:14 - then I need a callback so I can say like
113:17 - got message so I can now write a
113:20 - function called got message and it
113:22 - receives what it receives a lot of
113:26 - things there's it's kind of like it's
113:28 - similar to a get or post request there's
113:30 - three arguments that go here there's a
113:31 - request
113:32 - there's the sender and then there's the
113:34 - send response this is kind of
113:37 - boilerplate e and then ah so where do I
113:40 - get that message so the in the
113:44 - background script this JavaScript object
113:46 - let message write this message going
113:50 - this this stuff going in there is in
113:53 - this request variable now I employ this
113:55 - from an example so I might actually call
113:56 - this like the message so I could say
114:01 - console dot console dot log message dot
114:05 - txt so let's just see if the message
114:08 - comes through let's see if the message
114:10 - comes through so I'm gonna reload I'm
114:14 - gonna reload the Chrome extension I'm
114:18 - gonna go to this page Chrome extension
114:21 - go I'm gonna click the button hello
114:23 - hello hello hello I got a message from
114:27 - the background script to the content
114:29 - script which means I could say something
114:32 - like if message text equals hello then
114:42 - only do this stuff then if message ah if
114:47 - I get a certain message now run this
114:49 - code that alters the page so here we go
114:52 - I am going to have to reload the
114:54 - extension
114:57 - I'm gonna refresh the page now notice
115:01 - the content script has not executed all
115:04 - of the paragraphs are as they were now
115:09 - I'm gonna press this button and now
115:10 - they're all purple so I could
115:12 - immediately make it that every time I
115:13 - press the button it picks a new random
115:15 - color it just replaces all the text with
115:17 - something it reaches out to an API and
115:19 - goes and gets the definition of every
115:21 - word on the page onward neck and then
115:22 - makes those like pop-ups all over the
115:24 - page there's so many things I can do
115:26 - this is the basic idea
115:27 - there's too many videos about Chrome
115:29 - extensions I want to make is we've
115:30 - barely scratched the surface here but at
115:32 - least now we've seen manifest.json is
115:37 - the overall configuration of the Chrome
115:40 - extension what is it allowed to do and
115:43 - when is it allows to do it
115:45 - the content script is JavaScript code
115:48 - that lives within the actual content of
115:50 - any given web page that you happen to be
115:52 - on and the background script is code
115:56 - that runs as soon as chrome is launched
115:58 - that can listen for various events and
116:00 - do a variety of other things to affect
116:03 - how the browser as a whole behaves so
116:06 - what we've seen in this example which is
116:08 - really again just scratching the surface
116:09 - is through a there's different actions
116:13 - what we see now is a browser action oh
116:17 - the door is opening hello nope yep
116:27 - wrong room yes that's okay wrong room
116:33 - the lost my train of thought
116:37 - Oh what time is it oh I really got to
116:42 - get going the browser action there's
116:47 - also something called a page action I'm
116:48 - gonna get to all this stuff later but
116:50 - the background script can listen for a
116:52 - browser action like pressing a new
116:54 - button and then send a message to the
116:56 - content script to do stuff to the
116:58 - content so basic idea I'm gonna come
117:00 - back and in the next flu
117:03 - I did not trigger that sound effect yeah
117:09 - but apparently everyone's really excited
117:12 - so with just these two videos I think
117:16 - you could probably make something kind
117:17 - of interested quirky and creative that
117:19 - subverts and alters the way one
117:21 - traditionally browses the web so if you
117:24 - make something share with me on Twitter
117:25 - at Schiffman share it in the comments I
117:27 - forgot I'm always supposed to say like
117:28 - and subscribe everybody tells me I'm
117:30 - supposed to say that whatever if you
117:32 - feel like it like it subscribe and I'm
117:34 - going to also next do a coding challenge
117:37 - where for any given web page through a
117:41 - browser extension I can press the button
117:43 - and replace all the images with images
117:45 - of kittens so that's what I'll be doing
117:47 - I'm gonna turn these into like a little
117:48 - bit of a coding challenge and then I'm
117:50 - gonna come back and do more stuff I'm
117:51 - gonna add p5 to a Content script lots of
117:54 - other things so there'll be a whole
117:55 - bunch more videos in this Chrome
117:57 - extension but Berkeley playlist thanks
117:59 - for watching okay
118:06 - alright everybody
118:11 - local storage would be good to cover all
118:14 - right all right so I'm apologizing I
118:18 - have to run now I will thanks for
118:24 - watching the cottage fame this has been
118:26 - the coding train with me who tried to be
118:34 - serious today and not too crazy because
118:35 - I got a lot of comments but you're too
118:38 - crazy I can't take it the two manic but
118:40 - hopefully you'll learn something
