03:20 - [Music]
03:30 - [Music]
03:38 - [Music]
03:45 - all right doing a little sound check
03:47 - here how's my audio
03:48 - uh had some technical difficulties where
03:50 - i popped up on the screen for a moment
03:53 - uh let me know how the sound is going
03:55 - [Music]
04:03 - i'll be getting started in just about
04:07 - two minutes
04:18 - [Music]
04:48 - people are pointing out that the
04:49 - description has time stamps
04:52 - that's just that's an error that's just
04:55 - because
04:56 - i uh cloned last live stream
04:59 - for today and forgot to remove the time
05:01 - stamp so
05:02 - uh i will try to fix that shortly
05:11 - [Music]
05:36 - baby
05:39 - [Music]
06:08 - [Music]
06:28 - good morning everybody welcome to the
06:30 - coding train which
06:32 - has amazingly pulled into the station
06:34 - quite on time which is
06:35 - a thing that almost i don't know this
06:37 - might be the first time in coding train
06:39 - history although technically
06:40 - my clock here says 1002 so i suppose
06:44 - a couple minutes late usually i start
06:46 - the sort of well usually i start things
06:48 - late but then there's the animation and
06:50 - the music
06:51 - and me trying to like fix some wire that
06:53 - became unplugged
06:55 - and things don't get going till quite
06:57 - late but here we are i don't know
06:58 - this must mean it probably means that
07:01 - this is going to be a total disaster
07:02 - of a live stream which of course if i'm
07:04 - being honest is pretty much every coding
07:06 - train live stream
07:07 - but um i don't know maybe today will be
07:10 - the perfect day
07:11 - i don't have a plan oh it's been a month
07:15 - um how's everybody doing um i do
07:18 - have um some thing and while i don't
07:21 - have a plan i do have some things that i
07:23 - want to
07:23 - look at and talk about oh i do have a
07:25 - plan i forgot about my plan
07:29 - all right hold on a second uh let's let
07:32 - me take a minute to just sort of
07:33 - introduce myself perhaps there are new
07:35 - viewers here
07:36 - who have never tuned into the coding
07:37 - train before is that you
07:39 - if that is you please say hello in the
07:41 - chat uh robert
07:42 - uh perhaps has never tuned in before
07:44 - because robert asks
07:46 - is it 10 am or pm for you and it is most
07:49 - distinctly
07:50 - 10 am can't you tell by the glorious
07:53 - sunlight
07:54 - shining in on my face the sun has risen
07:56 - here in brooklyn new york
07:57 - out of the window of this attic i see
07:59 - steam
08:00 - coming from the rooftops of some other
08:02 - small building and some clouds going by
08:07 - i do have a lot of artificial sunlight
08:08 - here it's not really artificial sunlight
08:10 - i have this new elgato
08:11 - key lights elgato are you listening i
08:14 - really like your products did you notice
08:16 - how i also picked up this microphone
08:19 - oh um so that's why that's why i'm
08:22 - positively aglow
08:25 - well oh i was introducing myself so my
08:27 - name is dan
08:28 - um uh or daniel nobody ever calls me i
08:31 - don't know why when i say daniel i think
08:33 - i just said daniel
08:35 - you could call me daniel uh my name is
08:37 - daniel that was that's the name that i
08:39 - was given
08:40 - at the time of my birth oh many many
08:42 - many
08:43 - many years ago i was noticing by the way
08:47 - that um i have a rather young audience
08:50 - and i think that is positively
08:51 - delightful and wonderful um
08:53 - however if it is the morning for you and
08:56 - it is a beautiful day outside and you
08:58 - are part of the youth
08:59 - hey anybody really make sure you take
09:01 - some time to get some physical activity
09:04 - um um and
09:08 - uh sorry i'm very just i have like four
09:10 - different chats going out of the corner
09:11 - of my eye
09:12 - it's really hard to keep it all together
09:14 - i went off at some tangent about
09:16 - um having about um talking to the youth
09:20 - which really
09:21 - really really was the wrong uh train
09:24 - track let me
09:24 - get the train the switcher and go back
09:28 - down
09:28 - this track hello okay my name is dan uh
09:32 - i am somebody who likes to program the
09:34 - computer
09:35 - uh i am somebody who likes to make uh
09:37 - programming video tutorials
09:39 - and i have a youtube channel that you
09:41 - are currently watching
09:43 - where i release a lot of video tutorials
09:46 - and what you are watching right now is a
09:47 - live stream where i essentially
09:49 - uh waste a lot of time um answer some
09:51 - questions from the chat work on some
09:53 - kind of on
09:53 - work on some ongoing projects and read
09:56 - from a random numbers book so they're
09:58 - probably just to be clear
10:00 - better things you could do with your day
10:02 - but if you choose to be here i am
10:04 - grateful i am thankful
10:06 - um and there we go
10:09 - all right so i'm starting to think so i
10:11 - have this system by the way which is uh
10:13 - i got this like j
10:14 - like ultra wide monitor showing me like
10:16 - with like 15 different panels showing me
10:18 - all sorts of various things
10:21 - uh and like how many people are watching
10:23 - what the chat rate is and there's
10:25 - i have a new feature which um i'm going
10:27 - to pin this message
10:29 - from um kobe so
10:32 - you'll see a message that pops up above
10:33 - me this is my new methodology for
10:35 - featuring uh chat messages from the
10:38 - coding train discord
10:40 - right now this is only available to
10:42 - people who have joined as a youtube
10:44 - member which isn't necessarily my
10:47 - future plan forever but i'm sort of
10:51 - testing the system to figure out ways
10:54 - that
10:54 - i can take suggestions answer questions
10:58 - and show them here so i can pin
11:01 - and unpin messages as they come in let
11:04 - me get rid of kobe's message
11:06 - and um and simon asks
11:11 - what if uh just have the overlay on the
11:14 - scene so i think simon is wondering
11:18 - i'm a little awkward so um i don't want
11:20 - to just have a flood of messages going
11:22 - by i want to be able to curate them i
11:24 - want to be able to moderate them
11:25 - so this is the system that i'm working
11:26 - on this is part of um
11:30 - [Music]
11:32 - by the way this is kobe writes if you
11:35 - have no plan today dan you could work on
11:37 - the idea we discussed in dms
11:39 - oh you're so kind to think that my
11:41 - memory is intact and my brain works like
11:44 - a normal functioning human
11:45 - that i could positively pull out of the
11:47 - corners of the recesses of my mind the
11:49 - recollection of what was in our direct
11:51 - message i have no idea
11:52 - i'm gonna need a little bit help but
11:54 - what i wanted to do is thank um
11:56 - kobe and david who have been working on
11:58 - this particular system
12:00 - um it is called this stream chat um
12:03 - and you can um take a look you can you
12:06 - could get this stream chat for your
12:08 - it's like a bot and some software and
12:10 - all sorts of stuff
12:11 - it's really better for people who stream
12:12 - on twitch because it has a whole lot of
12:14 - twitch stuff i don't know
12:15 - david and kobe will post some
12:17 - information about that in the chat
12:19 - but thank you for um working on this um
12:22 - to help with the coding train
12:24 - interaction with the audience
12:25 - stuff so i do have some things
12:29 - that i specifically want to do uh today
12:33 - um let's let me pull up my handy
12:37 - dandy computer system here
12:40 - and so i have two kind of projects that
12:43 - i'm working on
12:44 - one is a live poll overlay which
12:47 - has come quite far along since the last
12:50 - time i live streamed
12:51 - so perhaps i could even use it today to
12:52 - do a quick poll to sort of pick the next
12:54 - thing to do
12:55 - that's something that i am sort of
12:57 - excited to start working with
12:59 - um i have been working also on this um
13:02 - presentation manager so right now i also
13:06 - in addition to doing this nonsense that
13:07 - i do on youtube
13:08 - i teach courses at new york university
13:11 - my copious amounts of spare time
13:14 - and um all the the courses that i'm
13:16 - teaching are currently fully remote
13:18 - um i'm using video conferencing software
13:22 - not a sponsor i'm just like this is just
13:25 - me
13:25 - like like asking for sponsors which is
13:28 - really a little bit
13:29 - weird anyway um so
13:32 - um and i've been struggling really with
13:34 - time management
13:36 - so i built this little tool that i can
13:39 - make a as a virtual camera out of it to
13:42 - pipe
13:42 - into uh let's just say it's zoom i'm
13:44 - using zoom okay
13:46 - not music zoom so i can create a zoom i
13:49 - can log
13:50 - into my class from a separate account
13:53 - that's different than me or i could do
13:54 - it as an overlay but the point of what
13:55 - i'm saying is
13:56 - this appears as a box in zoom and i can
13:59 - control it over web sockets to
14:00 - say who's going to be up next how much
14:02 - time you have left and really helps with
14:04 - um uh really helps with
14:12 - really helps with time management okay i
14:14 - got to pull up some of these messages
14:15 - that i'm enjoying
14:16 - so marcos says uh dan can only remember
14:18 - random numbers well i can't actually
14:20 - remember them
14:21 - the reason i don't need to remember them
14:22 - is because i have an entire book full of
14:24 - them
14:25 - and octopus would really like to see
14:27 - more of the live poll stuff
14:29 - octopus you are in luck so um
14:32 - these are ah the new year's event sketch
14:37 - right so that's i'm gonna save that
14:40 - though kobe that's great i
14:41 - think i'm gonna save that because um
14:43 - it's not yet december
14:45 - today is technically still november 29th
14:48 - it's still november
14:50 - and i am planning to do a lot of fun
14:54 - stuff for the holidays and new year's in
14:56 - december
14:57 - raise money for the processing
14:58 - foundation um
15:00 - do some community engagement stuff with
15:02 - all of you um and so that's coming but
15:04 - i'm gonna wait until december
15:06 - begins okay
15:09 - um is your shirt green by any chance it
15:12 - is not oh there is a cat
15:14 - make it come here there's a cat making
15:18 - some very loud noises over there look
15:20 - i have by the way also have a system
15:23 - by which i can show you the cat
15:27 - oh cat's leaving come on oh my god the
15:29 - cat has something in its mouth
15:32 - it's a toy it's one of my i think it's
15:34 - one of my daughter's toys
15:36 - but it looked like a little like a small
15:39 - rodent
15:40 - that it had captured all right i'm not
15:41 - going to worry about trying to show you
15:42 - the cat right now
15:44 - okay ah this is very hard to make but
15:46 - you know you just add
15:47 - one more piece of software on my console
15:49 - and i'm lost
15:51 - um so okay so these are two things live
15:53 - poll
15:54 - presentation manager let me also pull up
15:56 - something else
16:00 - i am now navigating over to my a twitter
16:02 - account
16:05 - um and looking for a particular
16:11 - uh tweet that i sent that's just a reply
16:15 - and let me see if i can find it aha here
16:18 - we go
16:20 - now i'm going to pull this back up
16:23 - for you to see so this is the other
16:25 - thing that i am very excited to maybe
16:27 - explore today
16:29 - open call for tiny code sketches
16:32 - tweet your creative code in less than
16:34 - 256 characters
16:36 - and we will display it on the media
16:37 - facade at media lab prado on
16:39 - saturday december 12th plus info so we
16:42 - can click over here so first of all
16:44 - um this is something that i have been
16:47 - following on social media for quite some
16:49 - time
16:50 - i uh i think there's a variety of
16:52 - different initiatives different hashtags
16:54 - there's one called twitter or something
16:56 - maybe even
16:57 - where people will post a very small
17:00 - amount of code that fits into a tweet
17:02 - along with a
17:02 - gif animation or recording of it and
17:05 - it's just it blows my mind what people
17:07 - are able to do
17:08 - and so what i want to work on today is
17:11 - not
17:12 - make my own submission to this that is
17:14 - not my role in the world
17:17 - my role in the world is to help other
17:19 - people like who are
17:20 - have creative ideas and uh think in
17:23 - beautiful wonderful ways to be able to
17:24 - share and express themselves
17:26 - and so if i can make a little example
17:28 - and some tips and tricks
17:30 - for how to get your p5 code down to
17:33 - or processing code or whatever your code
17:35 - might be down to a small number of
17:36 - characters
17:38 - um then um
17:42 - then i'm bringing up a question here um
17:45 - and then uh i'm excited about that so
17:48 - those are the three
17:50 - things on my list live poll
17:53 - presentation manager oh i got another
17:55 - thing on my list well
17:57 - i wanted to revisit my fall 2020 list to
18:00 - see how i did which is
18:01 - you know c plus b minus c plus i would
18:05 - give myself as a grade
18:07 - um um
18:10 - but um
18:14 - i also on this list i recall is i need
18:17 - to work i was
18:18 - planning to work on http uh this a new
18:21 - release of this particular processing
18:22 - library so many things to do
18:24 - and yet it's only 10 15. ah the whole
18:28 - day is ahead of me here
18:29 - okay what is on my hat not a very
18:32 - exciting answer
18:34 - uh but um it is a this is a baltimore
18:37 - orioles hat that is a
18:39 - baseball team here in these united
18:41 - states
18:42 - um i grew up in baltimore maryland i
18:44 - went to many a baltimore earl's game at
18:46 - the old
18:47 - memorial stadium i once i said recently
18:50 - i said to somebody oh you mean at the
18:51 - new stadium the news
18:52 - this is not going to be interesting to
18:54 - like 99.7 percent of you but i will just
18:57 - go with that for a second
18:59 - um the the current stadium in baltimore
19:02 - where the orioles play is called camden
19:04 - yards and to me that's the new stadium
19:05 - but
19:06 - somebody could look up on wikipedia it's
19:07 - probably been there for like 25 years at
19:09 - least
19:10 - uh but i think of it as the new stadium
19:13 - ah memorial stadium those were the days
19:17 - all right so um now i should be able to
19:20 - ooh so one thing that's tricky now
19:21 - here's some
19:22 - live feedback i've got it when there's a
19:24 - lot of messages coming in
19:26 - to the chat here i got to scroll back
19:28 - down to find the one to unpin
19:30 - okay um close out a bunch of things
19:33 - one thing i did which is very exciting
19:34 - my upgrade to my studio today is i
19:37 - moved the mouse got a usb extension so i
19:40 - can
19:40 - control it's not my laptop here which is
19:43 - a different computer
19:44 - it's not that interesting is it maybe
19:46 - it's interesting why everybody want a
19:47 - little behind the scenes
19:48 - let's look at a little behind the scenes
19:49 - for a second all right let's see if we
19:52 - can make this happen
19:53 - and then we're gonna then i'm gonna try
19:54 - to get the live poll going
19:56 - uh let's see connecting to your computer
20:00 - ensure that your phone and computer on
20:02 - the same wi-fi network or connected via
20:04 - the usb cable this should work
20:06 - come on fancy epoc cam thingy
20:11 - um let's see how do i get this to work
20:15 - not coming up so this is my new way of
20:19 - wirelessly connecting my phone
20:23 - camera
20:26 - and it's not working for whatever reason
20:28 - so i guess my little behind the scenes
20:30 - show and tell will have to wait until
20:32 - later
20:33 - okay um
20:40 - i don't even know how to turn this off
20:42 - now there we go
20:44 - all right i'll figure that out later um
20:49 - okay let's read some random numbers
20:55 - this always helps me feel
20:59 - relaxed soothed centered and ready to
21:02 - attack
21:03 - attack in a very friendly way give a
21:06 - nice
21:08 - friendly hug to the day
21:12 - oh wait
21:17 - uh speaking of discord
21:23 - bring this up here
21:30 - um i need to uh figure out so a couple
21:33 - things i want to mention about uh
21:34 - discord
21:35 - is that uh you may have noticed that i
21:38 - recently released
21:39 - a few uh three video tutorials on how to
21:43 - make a discord bot
21:44 - there are three more coming one is
21:48 - how to use env to hide your api keys uh
21:50 - it's about six minutes long
21:52 - i wouldn't be surprised if it's out on
21:54 - monday or tuesday very very short
21:56 - quick tutorial the one after that is how
21:59 - to
22:01 - um post uh gifs to discord
22:04 - um and you can see here that i've added
22:06 - a new command
22:07 - exclamation point gif uh kitten um
22:11 - and um so that there that is the next
22:14 - uh that's the s one of the video
22:17 - tutorials that is coming out how to do
22:18 - this
22:19 - and then the third video tour which will
22:21 - be a little bit
22:22 - later it was recorded separately and i'm
22:24 - just finishing getting it put together
22:26 - is about how to write a command handler
22:29 - hey wait a second k wickman is typing
22:32 - this is supposed to be a channel that
22:33 - only i have access to
22:34 - maybe that's not actually true
22:38 - um i don't know what's going on here
22:41 - so ah but the reason why i came into the
22:43 - discord is this is usually where i keep
22:44 - track of where i was in my quest
22:47 - my quest to read the entire book of
22:50 - random numbers it looks like the last
22:52 - time i did this
22:53 - was uh november 7th 2020
22:58 - and i finished up oh we should do some
23:00 - community contributions today of course
23:02 - i finished up on row 14 oh boy i'm still
23:05 - on page one everybody
23:07 - page one
23:10 - of my book um i
23:14 - uh need to go to row 14
23:17 - and column two all right let's see what
23:20 - we can get let's see if we can at least
23:22 - get
23:22 - maybe we can get to row 16 today that'll
23:24 - be really exciting

25:13 - oh you think
25:17 - [Music]
25:20 - well you know you win some you lose some
25:23 - um i guess i will have to figure that
25:25 - out also
25:26 - uh i don't know if the mic is actually a
25:29 - little bit quiet here let me turn that
25:30 - up
25:31 - uh okay music is overpowering the voice
25:35 - audio
25:36 - okay so is uh well hold on i gotta mute
25:39 - myself i'm about to sneeze this very
25:41 - exciting moment
25:44 - [Music]
25:53 - [Music]
26:10 - [Music]
26:16 - [Music]
26:22 - so
26:24 - [Music]
26:36 - do
26:38 - okay boy it's so many things to control
26:42 - right now i'm going a little crazy i
26:44 - can't even turn around
26:45 - the music okay i mean i
26:48 - i wish i could show you my behind the
26:50 - scenes here because i've got like the
26:51 - craziest console of stuff going on right
26:53 - now
26:54 - definitely need to get myself a purdue
26:57 - production team actually the most
26:59 - exciting thing if you will bear with me
27:01 - for a second
27:04 - um
27:06 - i i need somebody i need someone to give
27:07 - me like a really good
27:09 - uh quick um
27:12 - dad joke i know can you still hear me
27:17 - i guess why why why is um
27:21 - what's that number joke where nine is
27:23 - afraid of eight or something
27:25 - but eight is afraid of seven nine is
27:26 - afraid of seven because seven eight nine
27:34 - okay new drum new drum new drum set
27:38 - everybody i don't think that was worth
27:40 - it
27:42 - uh i can't show it to you because i
27:44 - can't seem to get my mobile camera
27:45 - working but
27:46 - um my son who plays the drums
27:50 - he's he got we got uh a friend was uh
27:53 - giving away their
27:54 - drum set so no more electronic drums for
27:56 - him a real
27:57 - life actual drum set let me get him up
27:58 - here to be my band leader
28:00 - um we'll see if we can make that happen
28:03 - for everybody at some point okay
28:09 - oh is that like really loud the um
28:16 - hold on i'm amazed by what's going on
28:19 - here
28:19 - ah too many things okay i need ghost
28:23 - chair yeah okay um
28:27 - all right all right all right settle
28:29 - down everybody
28:31 - let's take a minute to see if we can get
28:34 - the live
28:35 - poll going so um
28:38 - i am going to open up um i
28:41 - term here and uh check in
28:45 - on my live pull a web application
28:51 - grab the latest version of it now i seem
28:54 - to have made some changes here that i
28:56 - have no idea what they are
28:58 - uh let me move this down here and
29:01 - close this okay so many distractions all
29:04 - right
29:05 - so what's going on here i think if i
29:07 - type git diff
29:08 - it's gonna show me what weirdness i've
29:10 - put in here anything that i put into
29:12 - this can't possibly be
29:15 - uh stuff that i want so i'm gonna say
29:17 - git stash
29:18 - which will stash any weird changes that
29:20 - are in there then i can get
29:22 - uh what is actually
29:26 - from the repo let's open up the code
29:29 - and take a look so what is this live
29:32 - poll application so first of all i have
29:35 - a lot of people to thank
29:36 - um so one of the things i certainly
29:38 - realized is my
29:41 - technique of like putting out a web
29:43 - application into the world
29:44 - putting it on github having a bunch of
29:46 - people look at it and submit some issues
29:49 - and pull requests
29:50 - over a week and then me coming back to
29:52 - it live on stream to try to look at
29:54 - those pull requests
29:55 - analyze them understand them merge them
29:57 - resolve conflicts
29:58 - did not make for a good live stream
30:01 - i don't think that was a particularly
30:03 - productive use of anybody's time
30:05 - so i have been taking making some effort
30:08 - to manage this
30:10 - in between live streams so rather than
30:13 - try to merge a bunch of pull requests
30:15 - right now
30:16 - i can actually just go through and show
30:18 - you a bunch of things that have been
30:20 - added
30:21 - so there has been some restructuring and
30:23 - refactoring
30:24 - um one of the things you'll notice here
30:26 - to all of these ads so and so as a
30:28 - contributor ad so and so as a
30:29 - contributor
30:30 - this is something um new that i added if
30:32 - you're not familiar with there is a
30:34 - particular
30:36 - bot that you can um add
30:39 - onto a github repo
30:42 - it's called the all contributors bot and
30:45 - it follows this
30:46 - all contributors spec so this is a
30:49 - specification for recognizing
30:50 - contributors to an open source project
30:52 - in a way that rewards
30:53 - each and every contribution not just
30:55 - code this is something that i care
30:57 - very deeply about uh credit and
31:00 - acknowledging labor and credit and
31:02 - volunteerism and paying people
31:04 - and all of that all of the myriad
31:07 - kind of complicated discussions and
31:10 - topics that come
31:11 - up around open source software
31:13 - development so
31:14 - um there's no easy answers to all the
31:16 - different questions i ask myself
31:18 - all day long about how to work on open
31:21 - source in as inclusive in an equitable
31:23 - way as possible
31:24 - but i think all contributors is a good
31:26 - starting point
31:28 - so just so you know you can see here
31:30 - that anybody
31:31 - who has made a contribution whether it's
31:33 - an idea or a bit of code
31:34 - um can be acknowledged in the readme and
31:37 - it that process is automated
31:39 - so i don't know if um anyway so we'll
31:41 - see if
31:42 - i can demonstrate that actually let me
31:43 - demonstrate that right now
31:45 - um let's see here let's look at the
31:46 - issues
31:48 - um so actually i don't think i
31:51 - acknowledged
31:52 - john telton who and actually i want to
31:55 - look at this
31:56 - because i want to see if i can get this
31:57 - onto glitch um
32:01 - and so what i can do now because i have
32:03 - the all contributors bot
32:05 - added to this project i can say all
32:08 - contributors add
32:11 - john t alton4 and let's just say for
32:13 - ideas maybe there's one for like
32:15 - reference
32:16 - there's a there's a set a pre-written
32:19 - list
32:20 - of categories of kinds of contributions
32:22 - that you can tag people
32:24 - with um the one that always jumps to my
32:26 - mind is ideas so if i add this and i put
32:28 - a comment here
32:29 - um any moment now if i did that
32:31 - correctly we should see
32:34 - i can like play my little drum
32:38 - see i could actually get my son he can
32:41 - do this live
32:42 - but we can see we got this pull request
32:44 - so i can move on over to the pull
32:45 - request
32:48 - and um i'm just going to assume this is
32:51 - adding
32:51 - john talton as a contributor for ideas
32:54 - requested by shiffman in this comment
32:56 - and i can now squash and merge this
32:59 - and then if i go back to the main
33:03 - readme we'll see that john has been
33:06 - added here
33:07 - so this is one thing that's happened
33:10 - i think probably the most significant
33:13 - there's a couple of significant things
33:15 - that have changed
33:16 - um and it's actually interestingly
33:19 - enough now i'm noticing that it does
33:21 - create a lot of noise in the repo i
33:23 - don't know if there's a better way to
33:24 - manage that
33:25 - because now like i don't want to like
33:27 - find a couple of the key pull requests
33:29 - recently and there's like
33:30 - so many all contributors posts pull
33:32 - requests but
33:33 - that aside i still think it's a it's a
33:35 - it's a really great tool
33:36 - um there's a bunch of refactoring a
33:39 - bunch of
33:40 - like fixing just mistakes that happened
33:41 - as i just willy-nilly was merging
33:43 - people's pull requests without
33:44 - checking them there's no testing um
33:47 - fixing of the rats but i was looking for
33:48 - some of the design
33:49 - stuff um that i wanted to
33:54 - um coats this was super helpful by the
33:57 - way
33:57 - um i don't know too much about this
34:01 - but um this apparently so
34:04 - i'm like obsessed with code formatting
34:06 - and i
34:07 - really advocate that all of you watching
34:09 - do not don't be like me
34:12 - but um my shirt is not key this is a
34:16 - blue
34:16 - shirt oh it's totally what is going on
34:20 - why is it also half
34:21 - it's the same color is it because of
34:24 - this light
34:25 - wait a second this is the weirdest thing
34:27 - ever
34:29 - what is going on oh no that's it's not
34:31 - half it's just like actually keyed out
34:33 - okay i didn't realize that this shirt
34:34 - was
34:35 - gotta work on my key okay um
34:39 - so um
34:42 - so i'm trying to understand how to
34:47 - have good auto formatting of my code
34:51 - that maintains a set of standards
34:54 - and isn't isn't a barrier isn't like
34:58 - causing
34:59 - so much pain and suffering that it's
35:01 - actually making it harder to do a
35:02 - project but just keeping things neat and
35:04 - tidy
35:05 - and i think one of the things that's
35:06 - always been a point of confusion for me
35:08 - is
35:08 - and looking at this pull request it kind
35:10 - of helps me there's prettier
35:11 - there's eslint and there's husky so what
35:14 - are these things
35:16 - prettier from what i understand is a
35:18 - code
35:19 - formatting uh well it's what is it let's
35:22 - let's look at how does it define itself
35:24 - opinionated um code formatter so this
35:28 - actually uh form will format the code
35:31 - right put all the
35:32 - spacing in invitation in add semicolons
35:35 - make everything single quotes or double
35:36 - quotes
35:38 - i believe if i'm correct yes lint is not
35:42 - a code formatter but is a code linting
35:44 - which means
35:45 - we'll check your code to see whether it
35:47 - complies with a set of standards or not
35:51 - and then husky i guess is some kind of
35:54 - like
35:54 - dev tool that will write a bunch of
35:56 - scripts to reformat things with prettier
35:59 - check for mistakes with eslint
36:02 - is this um is this how interesting
36:05 - anyway so a lot of the stuff has been
36:06 - added
36:07 - so i would like to understand this
36:09 - better
36:11 - and one thing that i can see is that
36:13 - like ah so if i want to use
36:15 - single quotes there should be this
36:17 - prettier
36:18 - rc file which i can see here and single
36:22 - quotes i could change to true
36:26 - and then if i go to one of my
36:30 - bits of code somewhere let's find one
36:31 - that has quotes in it
36:33 - ah here if i now hit save
36:36 - i change it to single quotes now why did
36:38 - i get this weird error
36:40 - fail to load module if you have prettier
36:43 - or plug-ins referenced in package.json
36:45 - ensure that you have run npm install
36:47 - oh so the new aha
36:51 - because i pulled the code from this pull
36:53 - request down
36:54 - i now also need to run npm install to
36:57 - get the new
36:58 - packages like
37:03 - husky lint stage eslint plug-in printer
37:06 - and eslint
37:09 - lint stage eslint fix so much stuff
37:12 - so much stuff lint fix oh so these are
37:15 - some new things
37:17 - lint staged post install i don't know do
37:20 - i need to run this
37:22 - post install looks like i might right i
37:24 - assume i have to say like now npm run
37:26 - post i'm
37:29 - post install
37:33 - okay done husky is for universal git hux
37:38 - get hooks i cannot speak today
37:44 - all right so anyway moving along very
37:48 - very slowly here i now
37:50 - have in this project and one of the
37:53 - things i really like about working this
37:54 - way
37:55 - is on with these kind of weekend side
37:57 - projects meandering through figuring
37:59 - this stuff out is
38:00 - you know if i could get my act together
38:02 - eventually if i wanted to i could do
38:03 - some
38:04 - tutorials then that kind of go through
38:05 - some of these bits and pieces more step
38:07 - by step
38:08 - but um what i also wanted to highlight
38:11 - so thank you samuel
38:12 - martino martino for
38:16 - that but i wanted to look for the
38:19 - um some of the design stuff that was
38:22 - added
38:23 - see if i can find i mean let's see
38:24 - rainbow
38:26 - no i could have sworn
38:30 - seven days ago that pretty recently
38:34 - there was some work
38:37 - done to um add a bunch of visual design
38:40 - elements anyway i'm not it's not
38:41 - i'm not not finding it right now and i
38:44 - see that vishal in the chat says use
38:47 - typescript no i will never use
38:48 - typescript and then you could
38:50 - what like two years from now when like
38:52 - entire coding range is all typescript
38:53 - you can you can play that clip back for
38:55 - me
38:56 - um but let's let's see if we can get
38:58 - this running so there's a bit of
39:00 - awkwardness still with this live poll
39:03 - in that um there is no
39:07 - system to there's no uh endpoint
39:11 - or front-end page for creating a new
39:14 - poll it all happens manly right now
39:16 - by uncommenting and commenting back in
39:19 - this create new poll function
39:20 - so let me take a look at that um here
39:24 - so in um i'm looking for index.js
39:29 - or server index.js create new poll so
39:32 - let's see what happens there
39:35 - create new poll how come i can't find
39:38 - this
39:40 - here it is oh wait huh
39:45 - oh right okay so this is this is
39:48 - me so this is hard coding in a new poll
39:51 - which is certainly by the way there's a
39:53 - weird echo going on in here today
39:55 - so what should we do now i'll i'll leave
39:57 - that question
39:58 - or what next let's see
40:02 - so let's try oh this is good well except
40:05 - for bots
40:06 - so um ah so what do i do what what's the
40:10 - thing to say
40:11 - what what did i what was i calling that
40:12 - tiny code
40:14 - so these are three things i mean the
40:16 - live poll to be honest like
40:18 - it's it's a more live poll work look at
40:22 - community contributions or tiny code
40:24 - those will be the three options
40:26 - that i want to explore right now so
40:29 - i believe if i just put comment back in
40:31 - this create new poll function
40:34 - and uh let's follow the readme here
40:38 - um and
40:42 - okay i should could be running npm run
40:44 - dev already
40:48 - so that should have created the new poll
40:51 - then i want to go back and
40:52 - uncomment this
40:56 - so that should have restarted the server
40:59 - let's go to the server
41:02 - now why don't i see anything ah oh no
41:05 - so i need to then look at script.js
41:09 - line 36 so i probably need to then go
41:13 - into the database here
41:16 - and grab this id
41:19 - right this is the poll that i want to
41:20 - look at again all of this should
41:22 - eventually be automated in a very
41:24 - elegant way where i can just launch a
41:26 - poll through an interface
41:28 - but right now it's all very manual i'm
41:30 - going to grab that id
41:33 - and then i'm going to go to the web page
41:35 - that i'm looking at
41:36 - which can actually get uh get the poll
41:40 - id
41:40 - from url parameters but i could also
41:43 - just make it the default one right
41:45 - so if i go and make it
41:48 - the default poll id here paste that
41:52 - in then i should be able to refresh this
41:54 - page aha
41:57 - so here's a bug early bug
42:00 - if there are no votes it should probably
42:02 - have them all be
42:03 - zero percent so if i want to vote to
42:06 - continue working on the live
42:08 - poll i can see that that now is a
42:11 - hundred percent
42:12 - so in theory now and the other thing is
42:15 - this
42:16 - this does not need to have uh does not
42:18 - need to be keyed out so let me also
42:20 - change um the background
42:26 - um to be just transparent
42:29 - so i don't need a background color how
42:31 - do i comment something out in
42:35 - css that's weird how do you comment out
42:39 - css is that not possible
42:41 - oops i also just completely reformatted
42:45 - all of this
42:46 - somebody's got to know
42:49 - q a could be nice as well yeah i've
42:51 - never had a good luck with doing q and
42:53 - a's but
42:54 - um i guess i could just delete this
42:57 - fine delete this
43:02 - and refresh and that's good
43:06 - so now if i wanted to host this
43:10 - um well
43:13 - let's see let's do dude i um i can end
43:17 - rocket
43:24 - let's see so i'm going to use this um
43:26 - ngrok tool
43:29 - is this what i do
43:32 - no oh no ngrok http
43:36 - 3000. that's what i say okay so i should
43:39 - be so now people can actually go and
43:41 - vote right now
43:42 - um at this particular url
43:47 - which i can just put into um
43:51 - discord as well in the live links
43:53 - channel let's see does that actually
43:54 - work
43:57 - so if i vote here
44:01 - yeah so i don't know maybe maybe you're
44:03 - still 30 seconds behind
44:06 - so let's see if the votes can uh start
44:09 - coming
44:10 - in but what i want to do is get it as an
44:13 - overlay in open broadcast
44:15 - studio so oh i have my mouse here
44:19 - where is that um so i need to add a new
44:23 - browser source
44:27 - um and
44:32 - add and grok um and then
44:36 - look at its properties and i need to go
44:40 - to
44:42 - oh i can just copy this from discord
44:46 - uh where is that i'm going
44:49 - to
44:55 - um
44:58 - uh and i want to deploy this to glitch
45:01 - so give me a moment i'm going to do that
45:03 - next but i just want to see if this
45:04 - works
45:05 - i'm looking for where is
45:08 - my links okay
45:12 - copy link
45:15 - paste link okay
45:18 - and there we go it should be
45:23 - uh the live poll should be going now uh
45:26 - visually i've got a bit of an
45:28 - issue here where
45:31 - maybe um i need to think about how to
45:33 - make it appear
45:34 - better because i could go over to here
45:38 - um and well i don't know what is gone
45:41 - happening there let's go to um
45:45 - transform reset
45:50 - there we go so now i guess i guess
45:55 - so now i can cut this
45:58 - off and here we go
46:03 - so uh go ahead and
46:10 - [Music]
46:12 - vote
46:17 - as no one pasted the link into the
46:18 - actual chat i will do so
46:29 - [Music]
46:31 - this is very exciting
46:35 - there's apparently there's 500 people
46:37 - watching which is kind of nuts
46:40 - um
46:43 - [Music]
46:44 - tiny code is growing
46:48 - [Music]
46:50 - very dramatic
46:56 - you don't store the so somebody did make
47:00 - a uh pull request
47:05 - there was a pull request that did
47:07 - something to protect against stuffing
47:10 - the ballot
47:11 - oh god no please can i not talk about
47:14 - voting
47:16 - um i've got some breaking news here
47:22 - everybody
47:24 - breaking news 46 of coding trained
47:27 - viewers
47:29 - are so meta they just want to vote
47:32 - for working on the voting system itself
47:38 - yes you can vote multiple times
47:41 - i think but somebody did put something
47:44 - in there was a particular let's see if i
47:48 - can
47:49 - get to it here there was a particular
47:54 - pull request
47:55 - that had some kind of like validation
47:58 - thing involved with it
48:01 - um
48:04 - what is going on where am i oh i mean
48:06 - all contributors i want to go
48:07 - here uh there was a pull request
48:11 - that somebody implemented to do some um
48:14 - validation and and protection simple
48:17 - time-based anti-spam package and test
48:20 - so this was crunchy pie um
48:24 - who added a package for lightweight
48:26 - anti-spam guard it's time based
48:29 - so so i think what
48:32 - if i'm looking at this right that maybe
48:35 - this just protects you from voting
48:38 - more than once within a very short
48:40 - period of time
48:42 - so i think you can vote again but you
48:44 - have to wait
48:46 - 30 seconds 60 seconds i'm not entirely
48:49 - sure you can reload the ip
48:51 - um and you could but okay tiny code is
48:55 - now
48:55 - anyway i didn't mean for this to be
48:58 - super scientific
49:00 - um do not use the rainbow it's not
49:02 - colorblind accessible yes so that's also
49:05 - uh thank you for pointing that out
49:07 - prathamesh
49:08 - um one thing that's very important to
49:10 - consider
49:11 - is accessibility in design and which is
49:15 - to sort of uh you know my
49:17 - understanding of sort of what primary
49:19 - thing to look at is contrast
49:20 - color contrast um and so
49:24 - crabby says i use set interval anyway
49:27 - i voted 18 times
49:34 - and octopus is very sad here tiny code
49:37 - overtook the live poll all right well
49:39 - um there we go uh this was interesting
49:42 - to see
49:44 - i used a clicker says anti-venom that
49:47 - must be some fancy futuristic technology
49:50 - here
49:54 - all right so i do want to definitely
49:57 - take a look at the tiny code stuff
50:00 - this is so weird this is like this is
50:02 - like oppo this is like bizarro coding
50:05 - train i started on time
50:07 - i was like i must be running out of time
50:08 - now it's only 10 45. i'm like
50:10 - doing this for hours on end um
50:16 - and um but uh
50:19 - bader says they spammed tiny code the
50:22 - anti-spam isn't connected um so where do
50:26 - i
50:26 - say samuel martino
50:32 - so cross says that they are colorblind
50:35 - um and so uh definitely fi if um you
50:38 - know cross i hopefully um
50:40 - if you have some experience with this
50:41 - whether your own personal experience or
50:42 - as a designer
50:44 - uh color um if uh if you want to file an
50:47 - issue
50:47 - um that um to um i would love to correct
50:52 - the a rainbow design and use a different
50:55 - design
50:55 - so that it is accessible to anyone who
50:59 - has color blindness
51:00 - or any other type of vision impairment
51:03 - okay all right so
51:06 - moving along here
51:10 - let's uh put the so the so what
51:14 - what next let me solicit some help from
51:17 - people
51:18 - so what are some things that need to
51:20 - happen next
51:21 - for the live poll i will make
51:25 - an issue here and i will say
51:30 - help wanted
51:35 - um future improvements now ordinarily i
51:38 - might suggest
51:39 - oh and you're not seeing what i'm doing
51:41 - here ordinarily i might suggest
51:44 - um
51:48 - and uh let's see here nope
51:52 - shoot the wrong one okay ordinarily i
51:55 - might suggest a
51:56 - separate issue for each uh
52:00 - improvement or bug report but because
52:03 - i'm live streaming and i want to move
52:04 - quickly here i just want to
52:06 - create a quick list of things that are
52:09 - um ah and
52:13 - flesh mash mesh mesh in prathamesh
52:16 - is pronounced like it rhymes with flesh
52:19 - let's let me practice this one
52:20 - another thing that's very important to
52:22 - me is pronouncing people's names
52:24 - correctly
52:25 - um i do my best i don't always remember
52:27 - it's something that i really
52:28 - work on with students that i have in my
52:30 - nyu classes it's
52:31 - you know i feel like it's not their job
52:34 - to
52:34 - correct me or to sit quietly while i
52:36 - mispronounce their names
52:37 - it's my job to learn to pronounce names
52:39 - correctly
52:40 - um and so the mesh in profamesh is
52:44 - pronounced like it rhymes with flesh not
52:45 - mash
52:46 - so profamesh hopefully that was an
52:49 - improvement
52:50 - on the pronunciation now so what are
52:53 - some things that need to happen next
52:55 - deploy to glitch which i could work on
52:58 - today myself
53:00 - um oh yeah a different cat has emerged
53:03 - by the way
53:04 - um uh accessibility
53:08 - concerns uh color um rainbow color
53:12 - etc
53:15 - um uh what else um
53:21 - endpoint for new poll and front
53:24 - and for new poll uh anti-spam
53:28 - protections what else
53:33 - um oh yeah and there was a suggestion
53:35 - it's already in there as an issue
53:37 - to add web sockets so that
53:41 - so that would be a nice improvement um
53:44 - okay
53:45 - so what else am i missing anything
53:47 - important um i'm going to
53:50 - submit this issue these will be things
53:53 - that i will hopefully consider for next
53:54 - week also
53:56 - i have to figure out how to have i guess
53:58 - another question is
54:01 - um i'm gonna make this a new issue
54:05 - uh overlay design
54:09 - how um different
54:12 - views for uh
54:16 - different scenarios in obs
54:19 - for example
54:23 - um maybe a semi-transparent
54:27 - background for when the obs
54:30 - video is very noisy and busy
54:34 - i don't that makes sense what i'm saying
54:36 - here
54:39 - transparent all right
54:42 - all right
54:49 - moving along
54:52 - [Laughter]
54:54 - let me move to looking at
54:57 - uh so i i would love for people to
54:59 - continue
55:00 - to work on this submit pull requests
55:02 - file issues
55:04 - i'm trying to keep an eye on it over the
55:05 - course of the week i'm kind of managing
55:07 - this myself
55:08 - doing a pretty poor job of it but i i
55:10 - welcome your contributions
55:12 - um now
55:16 - let's move on to
55:19 - looking at tiny code sketches
55:23 - so i want to understand um
55:27 - um how this works what are what are some
55:29 - of the let me see if i can find very
55:31 - briefly
55:32 - um
55:35 - one of the hashtags that i really like
55:40 - um shoot is kind of awkward that i'm not
55:49 - signed in
55:49 - on twitter but i think it's fine so also
55:51 - i'm looking for something
55:56 - um yeah so
56:02 - ah natto must be watching i'm looking
56:04 - under um
56:05 - because natto just uh screenshot the
56:08 - poll
56:08 - on twitter the reason why i'm looking
56:10 - for an alto i don't know if i'm
56:11 - pronouncing your name correctly
56:13 - um i would love help with that i'm
56:15 - looking for maybe you can help me with
56:17 - this
56:17 - um if you're in the chat i i feel like i
56:19 - went to your twitter instantly to find
56:22 - some of the hashtags
56:23 - i feel like you're always retweeting um
56:25 - tinycode sketches
56:27 - um so ah okay uh here we go
56:31 - let's look at this casey reese tweet
56:34 - which i think has a couple
56:35 - this is this is perfect um
56:38 - so um i am at this tweet now
56:42 - where i believe that these are two
56:44 - hashtags that are used quite commonly
56:47 - for these um tiny code challenges so
56:50 - let's click on both of these
56:52 - and let's take a look oh they couldn't
56:55 - you believe that this game
56:56 - it's like i i just like oh my god i
56:59 - can't believe how wonderful this is like
57:00 - the greatest thing ever
57:02 - and i can't i'm only sad that i didn't
57:04 - make it myself
57:05 - i can't believe this came up so perfect
57:08 - so here's the idea
57:09 - and what i what i wanted to do was start
57:12 - to understand
57:14 - how like what are some of these tricks
57:17 - here
57:18 - that are being used to
57:21 - whittle down a longer piece of code into
57:24 - something shorter so i
57:25 - thought what might make sense is for me
57:27 - to take one of my coding challenges
57:30 - um and right so there is a
57:34 - the concept thank you to uh
57:37 - kobe who's posted the concept is known
57:39 - as code
57:40 - golfing so i i'm quite familiar
57:44 - with it as a regex golf which is this
57:46 - idea of like
57:47 - trying to write the shortest regular
57:48 - expression to match a particular pattern
57:51 - um so um but in a way like i think of
57:56 - i you know i don't love the sort of
57:58 - competitive
57:59 - nature of code golfing um
58:02 - what i think is wonderful about this
58:06 - is it's not really about having the
58:08 - shortest code
58:09 - it's about this sort of creative
58:11 - constraint because
58:12 - there's nothing inherently better but
58:15 - this sketch fits into
58:17 - fewer characters than what it is right
58:19 - now as long as it can fit within this
58:20 - constraint
58:21 - of a single tweet um so let's see let's
58:24 - so first of all let's just
58:27 - let's just prove the point that this
58:29 - works by going to the p5 web editor
58:32 - and let's um what should i call this
58:36 - um so this is i'm just going to put a
58:39 - comment here i'm just going to
58:42 - let's get to this yeah perfect it's
58:45 - going to put a comment
58:46 - in here
58:49 - and now i think i can close this
58:52 - um let's go to here and let's grab this
58:56 - code
59:00 - and let's run it and whoa
59:04 - wow ah interesting so what's
59:08 - missing why is this showing up
59:12 - differently now a couple ah okay
59:16 - i i do oh i know why
59:19 - so a little uh unfortunate thing
59:21 - happened here
59:22 - where um the emojis uh didn't copy paste
59:26 - correctly
59:27 - so let's see if i can replace those
59:32 - with my own let's see so let me get to
59:35 - a tree let's put this here
59:40 - and then let's put the tram
59:44 - tram car train which was what was used
59:47 - here
59:47 - let's just try i don't know if um
59:52 - i don't know if it matters let's just
59:53 - use this one tram car
59:55 - and let's run it there we go
59:58 - and what is there another one that i'm
60:00 - missing here
60:02 - or yeah no that's just
60:05 - ah there's no white uh so i suppose
60:10 - would it if i did this
60:20 - there we go so i've gotten something
60:22 - close now so there's
60:23 - a little bit of extra stuff there and
60:25 - let me just
60:41 - so what is the magic of what's happening
60:44 - here
60:45 - there's a lot of tricks to this first of
60:48 - all no semicolons
60:50 - lots of one character variable names
60:54 - create it's really unfortunate that
60:56 - create canvas is such a
60:58 - long word but let's let's go to
61:02 - uh codingtrain.com let's go to the
61:03 - coding challenges
61:06 - and let's find one
61:09 - um and see if we can fit it into a tweet
61:15 - the raycasting one is kind of
61:16 - interesting i don't know if anybody has
61:18 - a particular oh i'm in in dark
61:21 - mode also right that's that's why in the
61:23 - web editor thank you that's
61:24 - obviously a great point like could i
61:27 - um like well no i can't get the open
61:30 - simplex noise loop to work
61:32 - because it requires um a whole separate
61:35 - library but i could
61:37 - try like a perlin noise loop that's an
61:39 - interesting one to try
61:42 - um let's look at the code for this one
61:48 - yeah so for example
61:51 - could i fit this into a tweet
61:57 - um and right and
62:00 - um this is a great comment also from
62:03 - [Music]
62:04 - uh kobe who says code golfing is an art
62:08 - in this case and not a competition which
62:09 - makes it beautiful and i i really do
62:11 - agree with that sentiment
62:13 - um so let's see oh the meta balls one is
62:16 - also a good one
62:17 - i don't know i think i'm going to try
62:18 - this one so let me duplicate it
62:24 - and um so let's try this as purlin
62:29 - noise loop tiny
62:32 - code okay and uh
62:36 - in case anyone wants to follow along i'm
62:38 - really
62:40 - i think i'm having an allergy to my pets
62:42 - today
62:43 - um you know actually i was cleaning up
62:45 - up here in the attic and i think i
62:46 - kicked up a lot of dust i'm constantly
62:48 - feeling like i need to sneeze so i
62:50 - apologize
62:54 - it's coming along um let me post a link
62:57 - to this sketch
62:59 - so if people want to follow along you
63:01 - know as i save you'll be able to refresh
63:03 - this url and you'll get the code
63:06 - so let's see so i'm going to get rid of
63:09 - the slider first of all
63:12 - and just have it be a fixed value
63:16 - so where what this noise max
63:20 - uh what what did we have the slider
63:22 - range it started at
63:24 - uh between 0 and 10 and the default was
63:26 - 3.
63:28 - so let me just get rid of the slider
63:29 - here and change
63:32 - the um
63:36 - this to three
63:40 - now i wish i had a chrome extension or
63:43 - something that could
63:44 - actively count the number of characters
63:46 - i have here i mean
63:47 - i could always
63:51 - just go whoops well i'm not logged i
63:54 - can't
63:55 - uh i guess i need to log into twitter
63:57 - let's let's let's make that happen
63:59 - people
64:00 - um give me a second here
64:03 - um
64:03 - [Music]
64:10 - login
64:12 - it's gonna take me an hour to log into
64:14 - my twitter account because i have to
64:17 - look up my password at my password
64:18 - manager
64:20 - and um
64:26 - uh talk amongst yourselves for a minute
64:30 - here people
64:41 - [Music]
64:52 - do
64:57 - [Music]
65:03 - [Music]
65:36 - [Music]
65:42 - [Music]
65:48 - do
65:52 - [Music]
65:57 - okay i i was much too afraid to log into
66:00 - my actual twitter account
66:02 - so i logged into this account for a
66:04 - twitter bot example that i was
66:06 - been working on and just for the sake of
66:08 - argument what i want to do is go
66:10 - over to um
66:14 - the p5 web editor grab this code and
66:18 - paste it in here so we can see here this
66:20 - is how
66:21 - i am oh it's
66:24 - wow look at this because it's in the
66:26 - code comments it actually
66:30 - gave a little preview to the video here
66:32 - so i'm 441 characters over so we got to
66:34 - get
66:35 - get working on this first of all i think
66:37 - we can get rid of all of these
66:40 - um let's do auto refresh i'm not you
66:43 - know um
66:44 - so the uh i was gonna say i i don't need
66:46 - the slider sorry
66:47 - um i can see immediately that i don't
66:50 - need this noise max
66:52 - variable because i can just put three
66:54 - and three here
66:57 - um i
67:00 - um phase can be a one
67:04 - letter variable z offset can be a one
67:06 - letter variable
67:08 - so let's do p p z
67:12 - let's call this x y
67:15 - x so i'm just like lowering variable
67:18 - names right now
67:19 - um and shape close
67:23 - p and z so even just with
67:28 - x has already been declared oh um
67:31 - so this is totally extra stuff that i
67:33 - don't need
67:37 - here let's look at this
67:41 - okay so we can see even with just making
67:44 - some
67:45 - one ver a tiny code is 256 that's
67:48 - correct
67:49 - so the limit this is a um sorry this is
67:51 - a really good
67:52 - um comment from octopus twitter has a
67:55 - limp character of 280 characters i
67:57 - believe the constraint for the tiny code
67:58 - challenge
67:59 - is uh 256. so i should
68:03 - try to make that i can use tau rather
68:06 - than two pi
68:11 - there we go all right so i'm going to
68:12 - definitely be taking your suggestions
68:14 - from the chat
68:16 - uh thank you for that one luke finch um
68:19 - arrow functions and no let const for
68:22 - variables so here's another one let's do
68:24 - this
68:25 - so instead of saying function setup can
68:28 - be
68:29 - this and draw
68:34 - can be this i think is how i have to
68:36 - write it
68:39 - still good and no let and const so i
68:43 - think i could do
68:43 - this right p comma z equals zero
68:49 - no p is not defined
68:56 - is that a thing yeah i didn't know you
69:00 - could do that but
69:01 - let's say that all right so let's see
69:02 - how we're doing character wise
69:07 - right i'm now fitting into a tweet i'm
69:09 - only 178 i just like lost 300 characters
69:12 - amazing
69:14 - so now um all of the white space can go
69:18 - right so um
69:26 - all right so this
69:29 - i mean i still need to be able to follow
69:31 - it somehow
69:37 - i should be able to just say clear
69:40 - that is much better
69:44 - do i need to do translate
69:48 - probably
69:52 - translate so this i could also do
69:55 - as this
70:00 - i mean do i need a stroke weight of two
70:04 - do i need to say no phil
70:10 - now here's the question
70:15 - radians of five
70:21 - uh no the other way around five degrees
70:24 - so point like i do about point zero
70:27 - eight
70:28 - um
70:36 - oh no no there needs to be a space there
70:40 - don't auto format no no no format
70:47 - uh okay
70:50 - so there's also this simon is saying use
70:54 - underscore instead of parentheses
70:58 - friends this is not something i know
71:00 - about
71:01 - i can do this
71:04 - huh i never have seen this what the
71:07 - what is that that i have never seen use
71:10 - minifire so right
71:12 - so who am i suggesting i could use a
71:14 - minifier but
71:16 - i kind of want to do this manually to
71:18 - understand
71:19 - uh draw so that's saving me a character
71:22 - still good still good
71:24 - um i feel like i can get away without
71:28 - using
71:29 - map
71:32 - there's got the math for this is much
71:34 - simpler right
71:35 - like i could just say right
71:39 - six times cosine
71:43 - plus three right that's that's the
71:46 - equivalent of this map function
71:49 - so y equals six times
71:53 - sine
71:57 - plus three is this still working
72:01 - oh i did something weird
72:05 - i thought i would go wasn't i mapping it
72:07 - between
72:09 - it's fine i like this anyway did i am i
72:11 - confused
72:21 - i'm i'm lost here oh no no plus
72:25 - it should be three times plus three
72:27 - there we go
72:28 - right because i'm trying to now
72:32 - um sorry i
72:36 - my system for comments is i'm now like
72:40 - if i so i think what i need by the way
72:42 - here's a little feedback for
72:43 - uh just stream chat if i pin something
72:46 - it needs to stay on the top
72:48 - of needs to stay on the top of the
72:51 - scroll
72:52 - so i can always like go out of order so
72:54 - i can always just unpin it
72:55 - and then i can go back because now i
72:57 - have to like
72:58 - get through a whole lot of comments to
73:00 - find the ones that i pinned also the
73:02 - green is
73:03 - very hard for me to see little comments
73:05 - you guys can't see this but i could uh
73:07 - um all right so now uh r
73:11 - is map noise and
73:14 - right i don't need to have these
73:16 - separate variables
73:19 - this goes here
73:22 - this goes i'm going to get to do so much
73:24 - more i have so many characters left
73:26 - z and i
73:31 - can i don't need the map function right
73:34 - r oh no do i yeah
73:38 - r equals noise
73:41 - of three times cosine plus three three
73:43 - times sine and i'm mapping it goes
73:45 - between
73:46 - 0 and 1 and i want it to be
73:50 - between 100 and height divided by 2.
73:53 - so times
73:59 - 200 plus one let's just do that for
74:01 - right now
74:03 - then vertex
74:07 - set the vertex
74:15 - uh end shape
74:20 - get rid of some spaces and
74:25 - how am i doing people look at that i got
74:28 - 12 more characters left to go
74:30 - oh amazing
74:34 - wow oh i messed something up here
74:37 - but um
74:40 - there we go uh so hold on hold on let me
74:43 - finish this off this is very exciting
74:46 - now i do want to log into my real
74:47 - twitter account so i can tweet it
74:54 - i still have uh line breaks
75:05 - no i messed something up um
75:15 - what did i mess up
75:22 - ah because if i put everything on the
75:26 - same line that needs a semicolon i guess
75:30 - there we go
75:36 - look at me so did i get this into 256
75:40 - that's the question
75:43 - um do i have enough i have enough space
75:46 - for the hashtag that's for sure
75:50 - uh the question is
75:55 - do i um
75:58 - [Music]
76:00 - the other thing about this the whole
76:01 - point of this demonstration is that it's
76:03 - a loop
76:06 - it'll actually like animate a loop but
76:11 - i could rename sine and cosine to s and
76:14 - c
76:15 - that's interesting would that really
76:17 - save me
76:18 - a lot of space it might because am i
76:20 - using them a bunch of times
76:23 - like in other words
76:26 - if i go back to
76:35 - does this still work no
76:38 - oh because it's not in setup
76:45 - so that works and then
76:50 - and then c s
76:54 - c s
76:58 - that's interesting did i save characters
77:00 - there
77:04 - so currently this is with 17 additional
77:07 - characters
77:08 - third no that's
77:12 - that added characters me adding s equals
77:15 - sine c equals cosine that added
77:17 - characters is that really true
77:31 - let's see here yeah i did
77:34 - so how many characters is this is um
77:40 - is this so if i do
77:49 - 263 so to get this
77:52 - in the let in the for loop there's a let
77:54 - in the for loop okay
77:56 - thank you everybody that will get me a
77:59 - bunch
78:00 - where's my let
78:04 - and also can i get away with this
78:08 - yep so i don't need that
78:11 - zero leading zero
78:15 - i don't need this one i don't need this
78:17 - one
78:20 - okay that's good
78:27 - so now
78:32 - wait uh
78:33 - [Music]
78:38 - oh i need to i need to shave off two
78:40 - more characters
78:42 - shave off two more characters what can i
78:44 - shave off here
78:46 - there's a semicolon oh there we go
78:48 - there's one
78:50 - one more character
79:00 - um
79:03 - i mean i
79:06 - could does this close actually really
79:11 - necessary
79:15 - or is it enough that it will get there
79:19 - no whoops shoot what did i just do
79:26 - uh oh what error do i have
79:34 - i have lost something
79:40 - ah
79:44 - i don't know what that is
79:49 - oh did i get rid of that no the clue
79:50 - okay so now let me get rid of the
79:52 - clothes
79:56 - well
79:59 - i guess i could have it have one more i
80:01 - i could have it
80:03 - um by the way i really like how this
80:04 - looks i could
80:06 - have it be
80:09 - divisible perfectly by
80:13 - two pie
80:16 - let's put the clothes back so right now
80:18 - i feel like i need the clothes
80:22 - and but do i have
80:33 - i did it
80:37 - okay so now
80:41 - now i need to capture this as a gif
80:44 - that perfectly loops
80:49 - how do i render it with a perfect loop
80:53 - oh my god um well here first let me hit
80:56 - save
80:58 - i should now i should really log into my
81:00 - actual twitter account so
81:02 - i'm gonna do something ill-advised
81:07 - first of all i'm gonna paste this into
81:09 - just a text file here
81:11 - then i'm gonna hit auto format just
81:13 - curious
81:14 - okay that's better i prefer to look at
81:17 - it this way anyway
81:19 - so if i wanted to get the idea of this
81:22 - also is that it's a loop
81:25 - so um i believe
81:33 - oh i don't know that it's oh this is
81:35 - just a closed
81:36 - loop here uh it won't be a perfect loop
81:41 - yeah no no i was i forgot this is part
81:43 - of my series about
81:45 - how to make a perfect loop with noise
81:48 - but i'm not loop i'm not making a
81:50 - perfect loop of the animation i would
81:51 - need a
81:52 - fourth dimension there i think or just
81:55 - have the z
81:56 - value um be walking through
82:00 - walking through circular values anyway
82:03 - um
82:03 - so i'll just i'll just capture this
82:07 - this way and we're gonna make
82:11 - our so i know hopefully this helps
82:13 - people sort of see
82:14 - some tips and techniques of things you
82:16 - could do
82:18 - um whoops
82:24 - um let's clear all these i don't know
82:26 - what's in here
82:28 - uh clear captures yes
82:32 - um and let's just grab a small amount of
82:34 - this
82:35 - i think maybe i'm where's 400 400 let's
82:43 - okay let's also
82:54 - what was i trying to do here um
82:58 - oh wait where am i what's going on
82:59 - people
83:01 - um would i let's change the stroke
83:04 - weight
83:06 - to four i think that'll look a little
83:09 - nicer
83:12 - to eight
83:18 - to two here what's p
83:21 - doing well that's the phase
83:24 - uh i can't add can i add an extra
83:27 - character
83:29 - no that's not what i want okay don't
83:31 - stop
83:32 - stop i don't care all right let's let's
83:35 - go back to
83:36 - uh four all right so now i want to
83:39 - record this for a little bit
83:43 - we'll just do like a little 10 second or
83:46 - five second
83:47 - gif
83:54 - um pixel size original is fine
83:59 - save as uh
84:03 - gif desktop noise
84:06 - tiny code
84:11 - could i
84:16 - i give it like a higher frame rate and
84:17 - will it still
84:20 - um tolerate me
84:26 - [Music]
84:28 - yeah okay so now what's the only thing i
84:32 - changed was
84:33 - four right all right i think i have to
84:36 - post this from my actual
84:40 - uh thank you to john person
84:43 - um for your very kind
84:46 - uh donation it's much appreciated uh i
84:50 - don't believe that it will become
84:51 - self-aware a random number yes john
84:53 - person will get a random number
84:56 - um but i gotta finish this i gotta
84:57 - finish what i'm doing here
84:59 - so uh i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and
85:01 - log community contributions have moved
85:03 - up into the poll
85:04 - so that's what we'll do next um i am
85:08 - going to
85:08 - move to signing into my actual twitter
85:12 - account
85:13 - um because i believe now this should be
85:17 - posted from my actual twitter account
85:19 - where are we 11 20
85:21 - okay log out
85:25 - how do i log out oh add existing account
85:29 - uh shiffman this will take a moment here
85:34 - for me to find my twitter account
85:38 - password
85:46 - i suppose i should mute my for all of
85:49 - you people who are picking up my
85:50 - password from my keys
86:08 - okay two factoring myself in
86:17 - and tweet
86:23 - okay so now um here we are i should be
86:27 - able to
86:28 - grab code what was the one thing i
86:32 - changed i just made the stroke weight
86:39 - so that goes there tiny code
86:43 - is that the hashtag i want i also want
86:48 - oops
86:50 - um i like this one p5t
86:56 - um they both fit um
87:02 - coding train can you do
87:05 - a
87:09 - train as a hashtag not really right
87:15 - um okay so i've got seven characters
87:18 - left i don't know what to do
87:22 - uh
87:26 - okay what's happening here um
87:30 - all right so i've got this now what do i
87:32 - want next
87:35 - i want to
87:39 - get that gif
87:44 - and put it here ah
87:48 - oh internet there we go
87:52 - come on there we go there we go um add a
87:55 - description
87:57 - sure um a
88:01 - wiggly like
88:04 - a circular
88:09 - jagged polygon with
88:12 - white outline and no fill
88:15 - jiggles and rotates with purlin
88:19 - noise okay so got that
88:24 - so i think i think i'm good to go
88:27 - i'm ready to tweet this this is very
88:29 - exciting
88:31 - uh arnov is trying the hilbert curve
88:33 - would have been a good one
88:35 - the hilbert curve that's a probably that
88:37 - that's i
88:39 - oh now i want to do it with the hilbert
88:40 - curve let's do the hilbert curve after
88:42 - this
88:43 - why not should i do another live poll
88:44 - since that was so successful
88:46 - all right let's tweet this one out and
88:49 - watch
88:51 - watch the likes and replies come in
88:57 - look at this look at this ah oh give me
89:00 - those fake internet points
89:02 - all i ever wanted was fake internet
89:03 - points the real internet points
89:10 - anybody got it under 200 oh oh so um if
89:14 - anybody
89:17 - has gotten it shorter particularly if
89:20 - you're in the member discord chat
89:22 - and you want to paste it in a discord
89:24 - message i can feature that on screen
89:28 - look at my internet points they're just
89:30 - like flowing overflowing
89:34 - i really i'm not i should not be allowed
89:36 - to do what i'm doing what is going on
89:37 - with
89:38 - this message all right um
89:43 - oh this was fun uh okay okay everyone
89:46 - wants me to give the random number to
89:47 - the john person all right so first of
89:48 - all i just want to say
89:49 - thank you for your super chat i wanted
89:52 - to be clear that i
89:53 - do appreciate the donations they
89:55 - actually make a difference here in terms
89:57 - of
89:58 - uh the sort of mental budget i have for
90:00 - the channel and things that i'm buying
90:02 - for equipment and
90:03 - having time to do it and i appreciate
90:04 - everybody's membership but i do
90:06 - want to be it's really thoughtful about
90:09 - um uh how i ask for that
90:12 - hey i i don't i'm not actually
90:14 - soliciting your donations or your
90:15 - memberships it's great if you can
90:17 - support in that way
90:18 - but if you do have um i'm doing fine
90:21 - and if you are looking to donate i might
90:24 - suggest a local food bank
90:26 - or um any other sort of non-profit
90:29 - that's helping people who
90:30 - um really really need the help
90:32 - especially in this difficult time
90:34 - and then if after you've donated there
90:36 - you want to donate some to me still
90:37 - that's great
90:38 - also of course the processing foundation
90:41 - i will be doing a fundraiser for them in
90:44 - july but for your donation
90:49 - john person i would like to provide you
90:54 - with your very own random number
90:57 - [Music]
91:00 - the setup function does not need the
91:02 - curly braces
91:03 - oh that's a good one thank you mika
91:05 - [Music]
91:14 - uh eleven thousand and six hundred it's
91:17 - quite a round number oh
91:18 - niraj stop for the donations people
91:21 - niraj thank you for blinking my lights
91:28 - and connor all these random numbers
91:31 - okay okay okay the eggs i
91:35 - [Music]
91:38 - 8781 29643
91:45 - okay thank you everybody ron and uh not
91:48 - ron connor
91:50 - uh simon posted this trick five
91:53 - times sorry simon i missed it uh
91:57 - all right now
92:00 - um
92:04 - let's see i kind of want to go do the
92:05 - hilbert so where
92:07 - oh i see set up there and so why don't i
92:11 - need the curl i don't need the curly
92:12 - braces because it's
92:13 - one line of code that's cool to see
92:16 - okay um let's do let's do one more
92:19 - because i can't now i'm having fun i
92:21 - can't resist this um let's do one more
92:30 - um let's grab the hilbert curve code
92:37 - and let's do duplicate hilbert curve
92:41 - tiny code um
92:45 - save and then for anybody who
92:48 - is looking for this later i posted the
92:50 - link in the discord okay
92:52 - so let's look here let's make sure this
92:54 - works
92:55 - ooh oh this is my crazy rainbow one too
92:58 - all right
92:59 - can i get this
93:02 - into 256 characters
93:07 - all right um so first we know we can get
93:10 - rid let's let's look at what we're what
93:12 - we're starting with here
93:14 - what are we starting with and i'm just
93:16 - well into my own twitter account now
93:18 - here
93:19 - we're starting with uh
93:22 - oh that's bad oh boy
93:26 - uh how's this gonna go oh no no uh
93:30 - so let's see let's get over here so
93:32 - first thing we can save a lot
93:38 - also i think
93:41 - just okay oops
93:48 - uh hold on i'm going to i'm just
93:56 - so let's
94:00 - let's take off some stuff here that
94:04 - is
94:08 - make i'm trying to just make it run oh
94:11 - look there's some commented stuff that's
94:13 - gonna help
94:19 - um just sort of shortening the code in
94:21 - the first place
94:24 - [Music]
94:30 - um
94:35 - oh i wasn't auto refreshing what is
94:38 - wrong with me
94:41 - okay that's what i this is what i wanted
94:42 - let me get it to like
94:44 - all right this is good okay
94:48 - so let's look here
94:53 - what are some things oh i'm using like
94:55 - vectors and stuff so that's
94:57 - oh my god this is going to be an
94:59 - interesting challenge
95:02 - oh my goodness oh what have i done oh i
95:05 - created a hard one
95:06 - let's see what let's see where we are
95:08 - now
95:13 - 975 characters to go okay
95:18 - so order as six i can get rid of this
95:21 - variable
95:25 - uh line 43
95:29 - yeah okay that's good i just have to
95:32 - remember that
95:33 - um all right so that's good um
95:41 - now uh n
95:45 - don't need this here we're good
95:49 - total
95:52 - can i get rid of this
95:57 - yup path
96:02 - counter being zero
96:07 - okay uh i don't need this background
96:11 - here
96:16 - isn't there some way to like make the
96:19 - counter go up here
96:24 - okay so we're getting somewhere
96:36 - um i mean this is silly for me to start
96:38 - just getting rid of the
96:40 - all right length is width divided by n
96:44 - so if n is going to be
96:51 - two to the sixth power
96:56 - um which is
97:00 - with divided by so like if i said 512
97:03 - divided by
97:08 - two to the sixth power that's just eight
97:13 - so get rid of this
97:21 - and i think
97:35 - the question is should i try i should
97:38 - probably make this
97:46 - i guess i'm going to leave what it is
97:47 - right now
97:50 - um and we know we can do
97:55 - i don't understand this
98:00 - i don't understand how that works
98:12 - okay what did i do i
98:16 - need this here
98:20 - right
98:24 - i think all the vector stuff i'm gonna
98:26 - have to
98:33 - rethink
98:36 - but
98:40 - where else okay oh this
98:43 - can absolutely be um
98:54 - do i even need these
98:57 - no i guess i do
99:05 - what if i do hsb
99:11 - yeah okay
99:15 - so now i'm now we're cooking here
99:39 - all right um now
99:44 - uh so how am i doing
99:48 - how are we doing character wise oh my
99:54 - god i still have 650 characters to go
99:56 - i'm oops still pretty good
100:00 - pretty pretty pretty good all right um
100:13 - so i know just leave some i need to
100:14 - leave line breaks until the end
100:17 - because i've got to be able to
100:21 - look at this
100:28 - this should work chaining should work
100:34 - right
100:36 - and then i also don't need these
100:40 - ah what did i do line six
100:45 - oh i need another parentheses oh no no
100:48 - there here there we go
100:52 - okay that's good um
101:04 - okay that's this is looking good now the
101:06 - setup
101:09 - um now let's see here
101:16 - clear
101:22 - um
101:29 - okay now
101:32 - this
101:37 - this hilbert function is really where
101:40 - i need to
101:44 - do some other stuff
101:47 - [Music]
101:57 - all right so why
102:01 - do i say new p5 vector and not create
102:04 - vector
102:10 - [Music]
102:12 - and
102:14 - this will save me some characters
102:23 - okay so this also
102:26 - can i make this function just called h
102:32 - okay am i already using
102:36 - p for path
102:40 - it's okay though um so points
102:44 - i'll call it t now i'm assuming there's
102:48 - a way i'm going to be able to not
102:49 - call oh well what if i did
103:01 - what if i did that and then
103:14 - oh no i have v here um
103:19 - so let's call this oh there's only so
103:22 - many letters in the alphabet
103:24 - a create vector uh
103:28 - uh create let's call it i don't know
103:32 - a a for create
103:36 - create i ate the vector
103:41 - or i could call this i'll call that a
103:43 - let's let's keep that as v
103:45 - and let's just change this to a
103:53 - k equals i ampersand three
104:00 - and then also
104:04 - um
104:09 - wow this is actually quite enjoyable
104:14 - oh am i still going here ah
104:17 - i better i better get this working here
104:24 - oh we're gonna need uh boy this is this
104:27 - is gonna need some serious work
104:30 - there's gotta be some ways
104:38 - uh and this is k k
104:42 - k i believe return
104:45 - a just want to make sure this works
104:49 - v is not defined 17
104:53 - v equals create vector
105:00 - hmm
105:07 - just just to double check this
105:15 - why is this
105:18 - not save and create vector
105:22 - hmm why am i not
105:26 - save and create vector let's see
105:29 - just put create vector back here for a
105:31 - second
105:33 - just one i don't want to break it so
105:35 - much that i can't get it back
105:36 - index is not a fine line 23 okay
105:41 - okay i'm back
105:46 - so why is vv equal create vector
105:53 - oh because it's aha
106:00 - where do i call the hilbert function
106:04 - make this first line of code
106:10 - okay because hilbert is being called
106:13 - oh hilbert's being the hilbert function
106:15 - is being called right there no wonder
106:17 - okay
106:18 - i have to have that beforehand
106:27 - okay
106:30 - let's let's have a little check in here
106:35 - oh vv pv okay
106:39 - okay still got it let's
106:42 - uh whoa
106:46 - oh we're doing we're doing well just got
106:48 - to get rid of 444 more characters
106:52 - no problem no problem
106:56 - okay
107:01 - uh
107:04 - can i do that okay
107:08 - um
107:21 - a lot of this happening
107:29 - so now length is power 2 to the j
107:33 - there is a way to write
107:36 - the power function right i also have
107:39 - this here
107:39 - this i've got to be able to do or
107:42 - isn't there a bit shifting way to write
107:44 - this
107:46 - um n equals 2 to the sixth power
107:50 - um change
107:55 - um right somebody will tell me that
107:59 - that i can never pull i can't um but
108:02 - certainly here
108:04 - this can be l equals power 2 to the j
108:07 - for right now um
108:15 - and this can be
108:23 - um i don't know if this is is that fewer
108:26 - characters
108:27 - i think it might be
108:35 - did i already use t can i use t
109:01 - oh is the switch statement going to do
109:03 - this for me
109:04 - do i need a switch statement all right
109:08 - so power 2 to the j is the same as 2
109:12 - exclamation uh two asterisk asterisk j
109:15 - thank you for that um so this
109:18 - i should be able to say two asterisk
109:21 - asterisk
109:21 - six oh is it also isn't that just
109:25 - the number 64. 2 to the ones
109:28 - two four
109:31 - eight sixteen thirty-two sixty-four
109:35 - sixty-four
109:39 - uh length is not defined
109:47 - line 25
109:51 - okay i'm back um
110:01 - oh i can't stop myself here must succeed
110:04 - at this
110:08 - just want to see like what where am i
110:09 - really
110:11 - with all of this
110:27 - okay this no temp is not fine 31t
110:38 - just i need a reality check here
110:43 - okay please remove the else is
110:49 - oh that's a good point right this
110:56 - isn't great coding but will certainly
110:59 - work
111:03 - line 36
111:09 - hmm what did i mess up here
111:15 - for ifko
111:22 - no
111:25 - k is 2 k is 1 k is 0
111:32 - 4
111:36 - oh okay hold on this
111:39 - is opening
111:43 - a for loop if statement
111:46 - if statement ah
111:56 - that should
112:03 - okay what am i working with now
112:08 - wait oh i got only 200 characters more
112:13 - to go
112:14 - ah this is great okay
112:20 - would k equals three work as if k is
112:22 - greater than two that's an interesting
112:25 - um
112:29 - okay right so i don't need
112:36 - these curlies that's i don't need
112:40 - these curlies
112:46 - um
112:50 - this can also be two
112:53 - j right
112:56 - okay
112:59 - now question is
113:06 - i mean one thing i could do is get rid
113:07 - of the rainbow color
113:11 - like i don't need to have color mode
113:14 - and then i could also get rid of the
113:15 - stroke
113:17 - like that's gonna save me a lot of
113:19 - characters
113:21 - um could i
113:25 - would no i guess having
113:30 - i need to write a swap would a swap
113:32 - function
113:35 - really save me that much
113:40 - oops uh-oh oh no it's working
113:44 - would a swap function
113:48 - if not k
113:57 - okay that's good
114:06 - so the swap function could i
114:10 - write a function
114:20 - hmm
114:26 - okay k is greater than two i like that
114:34 - okay save myself i need a lot more just
114:37 - get
114:38 - down to fewer characters uh i mean
114:41 - i guess maybe i should get rid of color
114:43 - mode i didn't want to
114:45 - but i think i might have to get rid of
114:46 - the color mode right
114:56 - hmm right because if i get rid of that
115:01 - i can always bring it back right let's
115:04 - get rid of color mode
115:06 - sad
115:14 - oh uh
115:34 - okay we're back to just sort of this
115:37 - plane
115:38 - uh i don't know how to get to
115:43 - david's comment to
115:46 - remove it
115:51 - okay hold on this will give me a second
115:58 - here
116:03 - uh
116:08 - okay where is david's pin comment there
116:10 - it is okay
116:12 - all right so that's working um
116:16 - how we doing people
116:25 - oh this is good
116:28 - now just out of curiosity does it
116:31 - oh i save characters when it's on one
116:34 - line
116:35 - wow so that's going to make a huge
116:38 - difference when i eventually get to that
116:41 - point
116:46 - so i didn't realize that
116:49 - [Music]
116:53 - instead of curiosity here how what am i
116:55 - really working with here
117:06 - getting close people
117:11 - you know what i don't oh i just realized
117:15 - something
117:16 - i just realized there's a fundamental
117:18 - thing that i could change
117:22 - i don't need to write a loop
117:25 - i don't need to save the values in an
117:27 - array
117:29 - i can oh boy i did that
117:33 - because i was technically doing it where
117:36 - i wanted to be able to draw the
117:38 - entire thing but i can just
117:42 - bear with me for a second
117:45 - right if i get rid of this
117:48 - i don't need that clear it's drawing
117:51 - over itself
117:52 - but i i don't believe that i need
117:58 - this array i just need the current point
118:01 - and the previous point
118:04 - to draw a line hold on uh all right so
118:07 - let me save this
118:09 - because i'm going to do something
118:10 - radical here duplicate
118:13 - i'm going to do something radical here
118:17 - i don't need this array
118:20 - i don't need this loop
118:24 - i do need a variable i
118:30 - and i don't need c
118:34 - i is c
118:47 - what i'm saying is
118:51 - i is h i
118:54 - b is
118:58 - i already used did i use a here i'm so
119:01 - confused
119:03 - um okay so look look just give me a
119:06 - second here v1
119:08 - is hi v2 is h
119:11 - i plus one
119:28 - right
119:31 - p is not defined line four
119:36 - um i guess i need to add
119:40 - these in but this is this is that's this
119:43 - is all shortenable
119:59 - then
120:08 - okay oh this is going to make a huge
120:10 - difference
120:12 - so i need
120:15 - a and b
120:19 - well actually i just need b
120:25 - so if the problem is what am i using a
120:28 - for here
120:36 - equals t index k what
120:42 - oh yeah yeah that's fine um
120:49 - so i need two points
120:53 - i need a let's call it a b c
120:56 - d i'm going to use e and f
121:00 - e and f or e f g h
121:03 - i i and j j and k i'm already using
121:06 - those somewhere else
121:07 - m n m n that's perfect m
121:10 - equals this
121:27 - then n equals m
121:30 - so n is not defined yet let me just
121:36 - define it as something very briefly
121:38 - okay all right so that works
121:44 - how do i get it so that it's
122:03 - do i really have to define it as
122:04 - something that's kind of irritating
122:18 - no
122:23 - all right let's see what i'm working
122:24 - with here
122:31 - oh okay i'm i'm doing quite well here
122:34 - i equals n equals zero thank you
122:44 - i hate that i'm getting this like
122:46 - warning thing but i'll live with that
122:49 - okay so now
123:00 - else can i do
123:08 - use draw as your loop exactly okay
123:11 - so now let's see if i put this in here
123:17 - can i just by getting rid of all the
123:19 - line breaks
123:21 - get myself there
123:49 - there's still a lot i don't have 50.
124:00 - can't tell where the line breaks are now
124:03 - but again i still have a lot more to do
124:20 - i'm just trying to think if this can be
124:22 - reduced
124:25 - most
124:32 - like do i maybe i don't need
124:36 - maybe i don't need create vector
124:41 - the dot x though is so much like
124:49 - right a equals t
124:56 - there's got to be a way to do this
124:58 - without create vector
125:04 - um
125:07 - ah okay i like that um this is a good
125:11 - suggestion from mika i can put
125:14 - v equals create vector into
125:18 - draw
125:22 - that way
125:26 - i can get rid of these
125:35 - i guess if i want to keep the line
125:36 - breaks i could lose the semicolons
125:42 - so that helps a little bit
125:52 - there's some kind of object
125:53 - restructuring i could do
126:00 - like
126:10 - [Music]
126:14 - no
126:19 - i'm looking for more suggestions
126:24 - because it's a square put 512 in a
126:27 - variable
126:32 - is that really going to save me
126:33 - characters though
126:53 - oh i see
127:00 - that's a way to do it
127:05 - hmm
127:09 - okay line ten
127:15 - and you could swap by saying a b equals
127:18 - b a
127:19 - can i really do that
127:38 - hmm
127:41 - um yeah so i could
127:45 - so one way for me to just know how many
127:48 - characters i actually have
127:51 - is get rid of these semicolons
128:00 - am i still good here yeah
128:06 - um
128:18 - this will just help me
128:24 - sort of see what's going on
128:31 - 50 hey didn't i have it better than 51.
128:41 - combine lines 22 and 24 i see
128:55 - oh that was a really good one uh that
128:58 - was from
129:02 - um
129:05 - that was from andrew garvin
129:16 - interesting
129:21 - how many characters did that save me
129:24 - okay down to 46. oh this is really hard
129:51 - okay i just want to like
130:11 - what am i down to now
130:15 - 37 people
130:26 - oh
130:29 - v a equals v a y dot a x
130:33 - that is super interesting
130:36 - so this is this is a really interesting
130:38 - one that david has just suggested
130:42 - for the swap
130:45 - so here
130:51 - t equals ax a x equals a y yeah
130:57 - a equals v
131:01 - a dot y a dot x
131:06 - yeah wow that was huge
131:10 - that was huge we're down to 28.
131:14 - can i do that with this last one i
131:18 - should be able to
131:19 - a equals
131:25 - this comma
131:28 - this and then i don't need
131:38 - oh boy i messed something up
131:45 - all right how do i do this last one
131:49 - a equals v
131:52 - this is a dot x
131:57 - and this is a dot y
132:10 - just for a second here separate this out
132:13 - okay
132:17 - all right that's good then get rid of
132:19 - these
132:21 - get rid of this
132:26 - oh now we're cooking with gas
132:29 - here okay
132:35 - i think could this possibly have done it
132:41 - oh my god so close to fitting into a
132:43 - tweet now we're way beyond
132:45 - my goal is no longer to get this into
132:46 - 256
132:49 - i'm just trying to get this into a tweet
132:52 - so that'll might be my goal move line 15
132:55 - k
132:55 - equals 2 to 20 and rename to else i'm
132:58 - not sure
132:59 - if i'm behind okay
133:04 - all right so let's look at this
133:17 - all right what else could i do
133:32 - um okay so this is save this could save
133:34 - me a character
133:38 - um this
133:42 - anywhere there's a bracket it's no
133:49 - yeah that has to be a new line okay um
134:05 - this looks so short by the way
134:12 - um i've lost david's message to unpin it
134:19 - um all right let's see
134:24 - rename if k is greater than 2 to
134:27 - else ah
134:33 - does that really save me some characters
134:35 - no
134:37 - no no no i can't use else because
134:41 - i can't use because i got rid of all the
134:43 - other i can't do that that was a great
134:44 - idea though
134:46 - uh if k equals one
134:49 - yeah um
134:52 - i do like what i'm getting line four h i
134:55 - plus plus remove line six
135:05 - huh i never understand how that works
135:08 - but i'll take it
135:10 - that's awesome line 15
135:14 - remove negative one
135:17 - and plus one those aren't oh negative
135:20 - one
135:23 - i
135:28 - replace i equals
135:31 - this so this is one that mika is saying
135:35 - with just
135:36 - shifting it ah yeah
135:42 - okay wow thank you mika that was a good
135:45 - one
135:47 - yeah slightly annoyed you can't pass two
135:49 - vectors to line
135:55 - uh okay
135:58 - how we doing how we doing this those are
136:00 - some good improvements
136:03 - 14 characters just 14 characters more
136:08 - this to me feels like there's got to be
136:11 - something i can do with this
136:16 - i divide equal four
136:21 - is that what the bit shifting is line
136:24 - four scale eight
136:26 - oh interesting
136:36 - would that really help but it's
136:39 - afternoon now okay
136:40 - hold on scale
136:43 - scale i don't think that that's really
136:46 - saving me
136:47 - any characters though with line
136:50 - eight hmm
137:00 - create canvas into draw and delete setup
137:04 - no that's not gonna work because i can't
137:06 - call createcanvas over and over
137:12 - oh you mean the whole thing just scale
137:14 - eight
137:16 - would that actually work
137:26 - so that does work but my line thickness
137:28 - is way out of whack now
137:33 - so i'd have to do like a stroke weight
137:38 - right i'd have to add stroke weight
137:42 - of like point two or something
137:45 - like that works but now i've added a
137:47 - bazillion characters
137:50 - so it's a good idea
137:57 - so youfu unfortunately so some of the
138:00 - the way i'm looking at the chat right
138:01 - now
138:02 - with the this stream chat is i'm like
138:05 - way when you post a link to a discord
138:07 - message previous message i don't
138:09 - know what that is plus plus j
138:14 - plus plus j
138:25 - where would that go with line
138:29 - eight
138:34 - i don't know what any of those
138:35 - suggestions are maybe line eight j
138:37 - plus pl oh like this
138:55 - that didn't work j
138:58 - equals one plus plus j is that that
139:00 - didn't work hold on did i mess something
139:02 - else up
139:02 - no yeah i like this idea
139:06 - but
139:10 - oh i froze froze ah come on come back
139:14 - oh no oh no come back plus
139:17 - j plus
139:21 - at least screenshot this
139:30 - we're gonna get this people uh
139:34 - line 14 i have
139:38 - plus l and
139:41 - negative l l minus one
139:46 - oh yeah look at this
139:50 - those cancel each other out right
139:53 - no
139:56 - l no no no two out can i do two times l
140:03 - that doesn't really save me any
140:05 - characters
140:08 - also what did i just do
140:16 - oh oh
140:19 - line 12 if k equals 1 8
140:23 - why is it like sometimes it's like
140:25 - freaking out and but that didn't save me
140:27 - any characters
140:36 - uh v i know that's what i was thinking
140:39 - instead of create vector
140:43 - but
140:48 - you're double incrementing no plus plus
140:51 - j
140:51 - at the end no i took that out
140:56 - i saved the sketch by the way
141:00 - line ten
141:03 - l equals two star star admit it in line
141:10 - eight
141:18 - i don't understand that
141:24 - v00 can be replaced with that's a good
141:27 - one
141:29 - oh that's a good one all right thank you
141:32 - uh to i've done that uh
141:35 - marion who said v zero zero
141:40 - j equals zero plus plus j
141:45 - i just don't understand
141:49 - if you remove create canvas q equals
141:53 - 5 12 and then okay
142:01 - oh i mean just use the default cam no i
142:03 - kind of want it to be bigger i mean
142:05 - that's an interesting idea
142:08 - like to just not even use create canvas
142:13 - right if i don't use create canvas
142:17 - right it makes a 100 by 100 canvas so i
142:19 - could scale the thing down
142:22 - very like but that's let's let's hold
142:24 - off on that
142:27 - let's hold off on that
142:30 - people are saying
142:40 - huh that really worked
142:44 - okay where am i now
142:49 - we have nine characters left to go okay
142:59 - replace twelve and thirteen oh i could
143:01 - use it
143:02 - a ternary on 12 and 13 okay
143:06 - let's try this says 60
143:13 - replace 12 and 13
143:17 - with
143:21 - k equals 1 then if that's true
143:25 - a dot y plus equal l
143:31 - oh you mean i could just use the only
143:33 - the question mark
143:38 - like this will work
143:43 - well if that's true that's huge
143:48 - i might be able to get my color back in
143:51 - here
143:58 - no
144:05 - hmm
144:12 - oh oh i see i can do
144:15 - this like that
144:36 - oh that's so weird
144:51 - i have no idea what this is like sorcery
144:54 - here
144:59 - no
145:08 - okay i don't understand what i just did
145:11 - if k
145:11 - is 1 do this otherwise if k is 2
145:15 - do this otherwise just like i put a 0 in
145:18 - there for doing nothing
145:25 - um thank you 60 for that
145:32 - but could i even keep going with this
145:36 - and do this now
145:40 - but this might have gotten me enough
145:42 - characters
145:45 - still need five more okay
145:48 - i still need five more
145:53 - i still need five more ternary operators
145:56 - ternary operators that's so could i do
145:59 - one more ternary by putting
146:03 - this here now
146:07 - and then
146:22 - okay down to 2002 oh my god this is
146:25 - insane
146:27 - line 10 remove j plus plus line 10
146:30 - add plus plus
146:33 - when i don't need the greater than two
146:35 - now
146:38 - because it's just the only other
146:39 - possibility
146:44 - oh whoops just did something awful
146:49 - no ah
146:54 - okay right so like if this
146:57 - is true do this otherwise
147:00 - if this is true
147:03 - do this otherwise can't i don't need to
147:07 - even check this
147:08 - shouldn't i just be able to say really
147:16 - feel like you should be able to do that
147:17 - no
147:20 - oh because of this all right i need to
147:23 - bet i need to keep going with the
147:25 - ternaries
147:27 - so not k
147:32 - do this otherwise this
147:36 - and then
147:42 - oh my god
147:46 - and then i don't even think i need this
147:48 - last one right
147:52 - no it wants one more or do i can i get
147:56 - rid of that no
148:05 - oh hey i fit it into a tweet
148:09 - oh my god put a as a global variable
148:12 - don't return
148:12 - a oh that's interesting
148:16 - put a as a global variable
148:27 - then i don't even need return a is that
148:39 - oh true of undefined
148:44 - oh no oh but then i would have to say
148:59 - did this actually save me characters
149:03 - it's working does this save me
149:06 - characters
149:14 - yeah i can i can put a hashtag in there
149:17 - now
149:19 - okay amazing but i still feel like i've
149:22 - got extra stuff here that i don't need
149:24 - i'm so lost not k do this
149:29 - or not
149:33 - one do this otherwise to
149:37 - do this otherwise
149:40 - i guess i do need it because i need to
149:43 - oh unless i get rid of this
149:51 - so come on i need more space people
149:54 - need more space think now ah
150:00 - come on give me some space there thank
150:03 - you
150:08 - another curly bracket
150:12 - okay now i've got the turnery thing
150:16 - all set oh my god
150:19 - save save
150:24 - i've got 11 characters left i might be
150:26 - able to get my colors back
150:30 - line 10 is unnecessary k
150:33 - is already set
150:40 - i don't think that's true
150:49 - i don't think that's true
150:52 - yeah no no that's definitely necessary
150:57 - remove yeah okay line seven remove the
151:00 - line break
151:01 - got it there's another one
151:05 - no whoa whoa no i have to have it
151:08 - because it's a function definition
151:10 - i don't know why i can do this that'll
151:14 - work
151:17 - i am going to put semicolons in and
151:18 - remove all the line breaks
151:20 - when i'm done get rid of setup by doing
151:23 - if not i
151:24 - create canvas yeah no
151:27 - unfortunately p5 needs to have the setup
151:29 - function
151:31 - you don't need j plus plus in
151:35 - line 9 if you do plus plus in a line 11.
151:44 - like this wait hold on let me save
151:48 - let me save save plus plus
151:54 - nope
152:00 - there we go yeah that's
152:03 - fascinating that saved me a character
152:07 - right
152:08 - yep
152:15 - so can i get this to 256 that's the
152:17 - question
152:18 - [Laughter]
152:20 - line eight a equals i modulus
152:24 - 3 and remove line 10.
152:31 - a equals t
152:34 - i modulus
152:42 - so unfortunately the youtube chat is too
152:44 - fast for me to follow
152:47 - imodulus3 is that all that that is doing
152:51 - with the bit shifting there
152:52 - the ampersand no i like that okay
152:57 - that's pretty cool looking though
153:04 - nope
153:09 - oh wait oh why do i have this here oh
153:13 - because i do it
153:18 - once
153:28 - that's weird wait wait wait this has got
153:30 - to be
153:34 - why do i can't i just make this zero
153:38 - and then get rid of this
153:43 - no that seems like something i could do
153:54 - right why do i have this extra
153:59 - it's gonna be the same oh i see
154:03 - and then i looped through
154:10 - there was no setup in the train tree
154:12 - example
154:13 - really i can do this without setup
154:23 - line eight uh
154:27 - t equals hold on let me try to
154:35 - hmm
154:39 - there's an implied empty setup if you
154:41 - don't have it
154:44 - oh says chris okay
154:55 - i don't understand oh you mean just do
154:58 - it in
154:59 - draw
155:03 - do it in draw i see
155:16 - oh i get it i didn't understand that
155:26 - that is wild 15
155:29 - wait what do i need to get to 256 uh 280
155:33 - minus 256 i need to have 24 characters
155:37 - well now i'm really determined to get to
155:39 - 256.
155:42 - is t only used for a equals t index
155:45 - k it totally is
156:11 - yeah i didn't need that that's a huge
156:14 - extra thing
156:36 - hmm
156:40 - initialize j in the first line
156:45 - no because it's got to be reinitialized
156:47 - every time
156:52 - oh i see what you mean no yeah it's got
156:54 - to be reinitialized every time
157:02 - q512q
157:06 - line two
157:12 - can i do this silly thing again
157:30 - this
157:36 - okay so close
157:47 - i or
157:57 - i or create canvas
158:02 - yeah that's even better
158:08 - there are so many okay i've got it
158:12 - line okay let's
158:15 - let's see kobe says line eight can be
158:21 - h equals i
158:26 - ah yes okay so this is a really good one
158:29 - i understand this now
158:31 - this i can just look at
158:34 - i don't need a separate variable
158:38 - a equals the index into this array
158:41 - that is at i and
158:45 - three did i get that right yeah
158:48 - okay okay that's good
158:51 - oh my god
158:55 - uh um
158:58 - can i go with v i don't think so let's
159:02 - find out
159:11 - yeah it's not that's a syntax error
159:14 - oh what did i do
159:18 - oh what did i do
159:24 - oh it's 1-1 yeah sorry
159:28 - okay all right um thank you kobe for
159:32 - that one
159:33 - uh let's see did i get it to 256
159:36 - characters
159:38 - oh now i don't know anymore okay it's
159:41 - not even showing me it's i have so much
159:43 - room left that's not even telling me how
159:45 - many characters i have left
159:47 - one two three four five six twenty oh
159:50 - yeah i think i did it
159:52 - i think this is 256. okay hold on
160:00 - how do i count characters
160:07 - that's 254 characters
160:13 - okay all right let's add i want to i i
160:15 - prefer for it to be on one line
160:18 - so let me hit save the other thing is
160:21 - why not go for a higher
160:25 - n like
160:29 - why not make this a bit more detailed
160:33 - like for example if i've already like
160:37 - lost track of where i started with this
160:42 - by the way in case you're just tuning in
160:44 - right now
160:48 - um
160:51 - and it's still working um i wanna like
160:54 - this was the
160:56 - original code um
161:02 - and i started with an
161:05 - order of six so if i made order eight
161:08 - like i'm just curious if i
161:10 - change the order back to eight where
161:12 - does what is that effect
161:15 - it makes instead of this being 64.
161:22 - i don't even know where those numbers
161:24 - went to
161:30 - like lost my mind here
161:34 - is it really just a matter of how many
161:37 - oh
161:38 - i'm not even doing that anymore because
161:39 - oh it's gonna crash at the end
161:42 - it's gonna crash at the end or will it
161:45 - just go back over itself
161:47 - right because the length is all that
161:50 - matters now right
161:51 - if the length is
162:02 - like if i do this
162:06 - it's gonna go forever right
162:09 - let's let this run for a little bit
162:19 - i mean i could do this just for fun
162:27 - i saved so much space i could make it
162:28 - rainbow color again
162:30 - k equals i
162:39 - eight
162:45 - does that work if i somehow do this
162:53 - no
162:59 - i can write v oh this one
163:06 - nope
163:08 - uh inside the indexing yeah i don't know
163:11 - how to do that
163:13 - do colors hold on the nicos
163:17 - musics
163:20 - this is like crazy to me i don't
163:22 - understand this one
163:26 - if people who are in discord can pull in
163:28 - some of the
163:36 - um interesting suggestions
163:40 - move line 11 into the for loop increment
163:47 - is that the only thing i'm using j for
163:55 - i don't i don't that hurts my brain
164:08 - oh there's this one
164:12 - yeah there we go thank you
164:16 - v1 it'll replace the second argument
164:18 - automatically
164:19 - there we go that's a good one line 12 k
164:22 - equals 1 to k is less than 2.
164:30 - that's another one okay
164:33 - define k equals i mu and use it in line
164:37 - eight
164:40 - no because
164:45 - i still would need to have it here
164:46 - because i is changing
164:49 - but there's probably a way i could say k
164:52 - equals
164:53 - i divide equal four
164:58 - boy this is there's okay here's the
165:01 - suggestion from nico
165:02 - this one i wanted to look at
165:08 - a equals v
165:11 - of i modulus 3
165:15 - oh my god i don't understand this at all
165:20 - i'm fascinated by this though
165:26 - so let's just think about this here
165:37 - a equals v of
165:42 - could i actually figure out what should
165:44 - go here
165:45 - based off of this by
165:49 - saying well let me just type this out i
165:51 - don't understand it
165:53 - but let me type it out and maybe that'll
165:56 - help me understand it
165:58 - v of i modulus
166:02 - 3 because it's 0
166:05 - 0 1 1. that makes sense
166:09 - zero zero one one
166:15 - bit shift one okay so it's zero zero one
166:19 - zero zero one one will this get me zero
166:21 - zero one one whatever i
166:23 - is and then the next one
166:26 - is
166:30 - 0 1 0 1 1
166:33 - 0 index i
166:37 - modulus three
166:44 - i didn't get that right
166:52 - does this do i mean for this to be this
166:55 - yeah that's
166:56 - not modulus the ampersand
167:02 - oh i really got off the rails here now
167:12 - uh-oh why is this so nice happen to me
167:27 - i don't know why that happened sometimes
167:29 - the web editor just freezes up
167:31 - okay i think i have to stop soon
167:45 - this is pretty good
167:50 - oh camera died the camera's not plugged
167:53 - in
167:54 - oh the camera died oh my god bye camera
167:59 - how did that happen this whole time the
168:02 - camera's been going on batteries
168:06 - don't worry everyone i have a solution
168:07 - to this problem
168:09 - it's called a plug
168:16 - uh although this might be a sign that i
168:18 - just have to stop
168:25 - all right nope this is an ethernet cable
168:28 - it's not gonna be any good
168:32 - what i'm looking for is my
168:36 - where did that plug go
168:44 - i didn't notice this was happening i had
168:50 - a cable here
168:58 - oh this is the saddest thing that ever
168:59 - happened
169:01 - i just literally had a usbc cable which
169:04 - is what i'm looking for
169:06 - actually what i need is a
169:10 - um you need that cable
169:14 - if i unplug my microphone like oh
169:17 - there's there's the cable i'm looking
169:18 - for
169:23 - you can't see what i'm doing but i'm
169:26 - plugging in this camera
169:28 - to power
169:31 - usbc goes right
169:35 - here why does this keep getting
169:39 - plug i blame my children
169:43 - you can fit in there usbc cable
169:48 - your usbc port your usbc cable there we
169:52 - go now i just need
169:55 - a other end to plug it into something
169:59 - right i'm going to unplug my
170:03 - laptop for a second and plug it into
170:05 - that
170:07 - hopefully this doesn't fry the camera
170:13 - let's see charge charge charge
170:17 - up my friend camera camera
170:22 - should be back
170:27 - okay should be back all right i think i
170:30 - have to be done
170:32 - make q64 i know but
170:36 - i think i actually want to go back to
170:38 - 512 because technically speaking
170:44 - um
170:48 - it's going to um
170:51 - let's record it
170:56 - it's going to take a very long time
171:00 - but 512 by 5
171:03 - 12. but i think it'll be fun to have oh
171:06 - oh it's not going it's going to take
171:07 - longer this thing only records for 30
171:09 - seconds
171:11 - all right so i'm going to need to do a
171:13 - quick time screen capture let's quit
171:15 - this
171:16 - um finishing up folks
171:23 - hello i'm gonna be done will you just
171:26 - play like a drum
171:27 - thing for me i don't know
171:31 - give me a beat will you give me a beat
171:34 - well
171:35 - it's about to get very loud in here i'll
171:37 - turn down the gain on the mic
171:38 - okay ready give me a beat
171:46 - [Music]
171:48 - oh it's going over it again
171:52 - that was good
171:57 - um all right i have to finish up oh my
171:59 - god it's almost like one o'clock
172:00 - oh my god wait why is it going over it
172:03 - again
172:07 - because of this
172:11 - [Music]
172:12 - um
172:18 - line eight oh remove the multiply
172:22 - right if these
172:34 - oh my god i'm losing my mind
172:37 - [Music]
172:41 - k equals two to k okay hold on
172:47 - in line five just add two
172:52 - why did this not go on to the next
173:02 - i guess i'm missing something critical
173:08 - here
173:11 - that's fine let's just make it a 256 by
173:13 - 256 thing
173:15 - i have to stop
173:24 - i don't even know where i am when all of
173:26 - my chats
173:33 - replace all ternary operators with
173:35 - immediate array
173:37 - god this is crazy
173:43 - uh turn a equals
173:47 - oh i can't i have to stop
173:50 - i hadn't restarted the sketch oh
173:55 - is that why i don't think so
174:01 - all right
174:11 - my my brain is completely
174:14 - has completely died
174:28 - five i have to stop i'm being
174:32 - i can't believe i went this one this was
174:34 - like so fun but it's kind of like off
174:36 - the rails now
174:42 - okay
174:47 - let's just see what happens camera died
174:49 - again
174:50 - [Laughter]
174:53 - um all right let me let it let me let it
174:55 - charge up a little bit more
175:03 - so i'm
175:06 - i'm gonna be just not on camera for a
175:08 - little bit
175:12 - yeah what did i do wrong
175:15 - for it not to do the full 512 by 512.
175:23 - is it this six here
175:27 - needs to be
175:36 - like for example oh how can i
175:40 - how do i tell to record chord okay
175:45 - um so if i go back to the original code
175:52 - order is eight n
175:56 - is two to the eighth power
175:59 - which is 256.
176:03 - that's how far it's at length
176:07 - is width divided by 256 but that
176:10 - shouldn't matter
176:19 - like if i go back
176:23 - to the original code
176:32 - like i wanted to do this
176:36 - over the whole thing
176:43 - and what did i do differently
177:01 - add colors
177:13 - i think i have to come back i'll have to
177:14 - come back to this another time
177:17 - but i'm trying to i'm trying to
177:20 - understand
177:22 - to the j j is less than order
177:26 - ah there we go i see what i've confused
177:34 - so
177:42 - yeah i just need to increase that
177:52 - that's all
178:02 - i know you can't see me i'm i'm enjoying
178:04 - the fact that you can't see me right now
178:07 - i'm letting the camera charge up a
178:09 - little bit
178:10 - because it clearly can't be charging and
178:16 - so there are probably still ways that i
178:19 - could reduce the
178:20 - number of characters um getting some
178:23 - good suggestions in the chat
178:26 - um and
178:36 - but i just want to see if this moves
178:39 - on to the next section
178:44 - which is very unnecessary but i must
178:48 - know there we go
178:51 - okay yeah
178:54 - okay so i have it calibrated correctly
178:56 - now am i actually recording the screen
178:58 - here
179:00 - hit stop oh i was okay
179:04 - so let me delete this
179:10 - and then i could i'm going to speed this
179:12 - up
179:14 - new screen recording
179:17 - there we go stop
179:22 - record stop and here we go
179:28 - all right i'm gonna let this go uh and
179:30 - then i'm gonna be done
179:34 - uh who who wants to help me uh quickly
179:38 - uh speed up this video so i guess i
179:40 - could i could make it long is it
179:42 - recording my audio am i talking
179:43 - throughout this whole thing oh that's
179:44 - going to irritate me so much
179:48 - now we're trying to get the color back
179:50 - [Music]
179:54 - um
179:56 - well let me at least finish recording
179:58 - this
180:01 - i'm sorry that i didn't do any community
180:03 - contributions today i i got obsessed
180:05 - with this
180:13 - i should have just let it do the um i
180:16 - guess i could record this later maybe
180:17 - i'll post this tweet after the stream
180:20 - um so i don't have to sit here and wait
180:22 - for it to do the whole thing it's going
180:23 - to take a very long time
180:26 - use ffmpeg that's a good point
180:33 - um yeah so this is by the way this goes
180:36 - against everything i stand for in terms
180:39 - of programming
180:40 - you know the i this was like a fun
180:41 - challenge to explore
180:43 - but you know my whole ethos is to write
180:45 - the code in as long
180:47 - winded away as possible
180:51 - um so i can't really increase the frame
180:55 - rate in the way that i'm doing it here
180:57 - but
180:58 - i see that i can use people are giving
180:59 - me great suggestions
181:01 - like marcos here's i use ffmpeg a lot
181:04 - i guess i should let this finish now
181:05 - that i have it started
181:07 - um the problem is i'm screen recording
181:11 - so i can't check anything
181:13 - can somebody check how many characters i
181:15 - have currently
181:17 - um and
181:20 - if someone wants to check how many
181:22 - characters i have currently i could
181:23 - consider if i could get
181:25 - just stroke back i would need color mode
181:29 - hsb stroke
181:34 - [Music]
181:38 - i should really do this after the stream
181:43 - but i like i'm a completionist
181:49 - you know we've got uh
181:51 - [Music]
181:53 - oh i don't have the um hold on
181:56 - i don't have the overlay here just
181:59 - stream shot overlay in the view i'm
182:00 - looking at
182:03 - [Music]
182:09 - 248 characters
182:13 - bruno says it's a good example to show
182:16 - why people should not do it this way i
182:18 - agree
182:20 - so i don't think i can get color and
182:22 - stay within 256 characters
182:24 - i could stay within the tweet though
182:27 - so i'll do a second one with color
182:30 - [Music]
182:32 - because i agree
182:36 - um that would be nice
182:39 - [Music]
182:41 - i still think that um
182:45 - [Music]
182:47 - this one this comment from la culotte on
182:50 - youtube
182:50 - so i i realized that some people are
182:52 - saying that people are posting
182:53 - suggestions when other people are copy
182:55 - pasting their suggestions
182:56 - so i'm not sure if this is the correct
182:57 - attribution
182:59 - and there is also getting a suggestion
183:02 - for how to rewrite the for loop to
183:04 - remove the curly brackets and the line
183:06 - breaks
183:06 - [Music]
183:09 - which i'm looking at um
183:12 - but i think i'm going to leave it
183:17 - um i think i'm going to leave it as is
183:20 - right now
183:22 - it's so close to finishing
183:27 - [Music]
183:48 - all right i think i'm about to reappear
183:50 - there i am all
183:52 - aglow let the lights adjust
183:56 - so close here
183:57 - [Music]
184:00 - okay awkwardly go up here and hit stop
184:07 - [Music]
184:09 - great so now i'm going to save this
184:16 - um okay
184:20 - save this all right i'm wrapping up
184:22 - people
184:24 - at export to hilbert one
184:27 - desktop hilbert let's call this black
184:29 - and white desktop okay
184:33 - all right so that's good now
184:37 - let's just briefly see if i can get the
184:41 - color back
184:42 - and stay within 280 characters
184:45 - so how did i have color i know i need to
184:48 - add
184:55 - that's probably enough that's
184:59 - i lost my i'm still within a tweet
185:03 - i have 15 characters to add color
185:06 - and then the original way i had color
185:09 - was having q b i
185:14 - map from the entire length
185:18 - which is
185:20 - [Music]
185:22 - path.length is
185:26 - the total number of points which is
185:29 - 2 to the 8th squared
185:36 - so let's just try for a second um
185:42 - stroke i
185:46 - divided by
185:51 - um so 300
185:54 - i divided by
185:59 - two to the eighth is 256.
186:05 - so that's that am i is that that
186:11 - how do i do something squared like this
186:26 - yeah
186:29 - yeah oh no no
186:34 - this is gonna get me color i think
186:49 - right it's the same thing right
187:00 - i can't tell if the color's actually
187:02 - changing
187:04 - i don't think that it is
187:26 - hmm
187:31 - it's so hard to tell
187:35 - because but i'm
188:04 - thinking
188:06 - i think it is oh and it's working
188:10 - it's just really slow it's change the
188:13 - color is changing
188:19 - it's changing color did i map the hue
188:22 - fully i'm not 100
188:23 - sure and does this fit into a tweet
188:32 - uh
188:35 - i'm over by seven characters
188:42 - i'm over by seven characters
188:50 - do i need these parentheses
189:02 - so i currently can't really i could
189:04 - increase the speed but
189:06 - not with the way that i've written this
189:10 - um
189:13 - spectral piano says they have 273
189:15 - characters
189:16 - what did i miss that you got spectral
189:18 - piano
189:20 - line five
189:35 - yeah i i think i can get rid of these
189:37 - two parentheses
189:41 - so i guess is there a way i can just for
189:44 - testing purposes increase the speed
189:46 - i should be able to say
189:56 - right
190:00 - am i using n somewhere
190:04 - i'm not using you
190:20 - oh whoops
190:30 - okay that's just temporarily increasing
190:32 - the speed
190:34 - um
190:38 - okay oh boy i've unplugged things
190:41 - everything is dying and also
190:42 - is this that's not right did i get the
190:45 - few
190:46 - full hsb
191:02 - yeah that's right that's
191:10 - whoa yeah i don't know i guess i was off
191:14 - by two
191:16 - i don't know why
191:19 - just make sure yeah okay i mean it's
191:22 - it's interesting to have it repeat but
191:24 - okay so that should be 14 here i'm not
191:26 - i'm
191:27 - i'm not going to question that um then
191:31 - um and also
191:36 - kind of want this
191:41 - oh okay okay let's not so i could let's
191:43 - not get too picky here people
191:45 - um what was i doing
191:51 - uh i
191:55 - wait right right now can i get rid of
191:57 - this
191:59 - that's two characters less okay yes
192:14 - [Music]
192:16 - um
192:28 - i'm so close to being done
192:37 - now let me just run this make sure it's
192:39 - still working oh i've messed everything
192:41 - up
192:44 - what have i done
192:53 - oh help me line 14.
192:57 - i need another curly bracket maybe
193:01 - there we go okay uh does this not fit
193:06 - in my tweet
193:10 - five characters i need to remove five
193:12 - characters from this
193:16 - one more for semicolon in line 14.
193:20 - there's i've gotten good suggestions
193:29 - replace 2 to the 14 with 4 to the 7 okay
193:37 - that's good
193:40 - now i am at
193:46 - i need four four more characters people
193:50 - four more characters to remove instead
193:53 - of
193:54 - x to a equals
194:10 - okay i don't understand that one
194:15 - don't line 14 k is less than two
194:19 - don't understand that one a okay line
194:22 - eight says spectral piano okay can
194:24 - someone grab spectral pianos
194:26 - um uh message
194:30 - equals two with less than three i've
194:32 - already done that i've already done that
194:35 - they need spectral pianos comment i
194:38 - i okay
194:45 - can't capture them i can't capture them
194:47 - it's too fast
194:48 - someone's got to capture it for me
194:52 - thank you
194:56 - okay oh
194:59 - all right line eight
195:03 - it's not line eight anymore
195:07 - well let's look at this a equals
195:11 - v i
195:14 - ampersand two
195:19 - times two oh is this gonna get this is
195:21 - just gonna give me
195:22 - ah i see zero four
195:27 - four zero
195:30 - uh right then i don't need
195:34 - the multiplier
195:39 - is that what's going on here
196:05 - i'm trying to figure out how to get rid
196:07 - of the multiplier
196:16 - uh oh my monitor died
196:31 - okay everything's falling apart
196:41 - i can't see anything anymore
196:45 - what happened there
197:01 - i should have known that it was telling
197:04 - me that
197:05 - there we go okay
197:09 - uh right i should this looks right
197:13 - it's just tiny so i should be able to
197:17 - say
197:21 - four times this right
197:27 - no oh no four times this
197:38 - no
197:40 - i'm very stubborn
197:50 - so this i like what you're doing here
197:52 - this makes sense this would be 0
197:54 - 4 4
198:00 - and then maybe i can just the
198:04 - multiplying can happen here
198:15 - and then i can just do the add here
198:17 - right
198:19 - no how come that doesn't work
198:39 - oh my god people are really
198:47 - i don't think you understand what's
198:49 - happening to me okay
198:50 - hold on all right chris ray has a really
198:53 - interesting suggestion
198:56 - this whole thing
198:59 - can be replaced with i
199:04 - am sand
199:07 - 1
199:10 - to the i ampersand 2 power
199:14 - i don't believe that fascinating
199:18 - that is not right though i'm getting a
199:20 - very interesting pattern there
199:32 - of not k a a equals not
199:35 - k or v and omit the a equals in between
199:44 - okay
199:53 - a equals not k
199:59 - or v but that doesn't really help me at
200:02 - all
200:08 - well i've got to get back to what i had
200:12 - i don't understand that
200:27 - i'm lost i'm completely lost
200:37 - why don't you need to move line 12
200:40 - to line seven i don't understand that at
200:43 - all
200:46 - yeah uh i
200:49 - i believe in this solution
200:52 - but i don't understand it
200:58 - um
201:09 - color mode three oh oh
201:13 - that's genius no the hsb
201:17 - constant is something but it's not
201:22 - three
201:25 - i think it stands for a string actually
201:27 - unfortunately
201:35 - can't remove the mult or the ad
201:38 - yeah i agree
201:49 - okay people i think i might have to give
201:51 - up
201:57 - is this my best
202:04 - oh i'll gain the character
202:08 - in between here
202:12 - okay um
202:36 - um so close
202:39 - line six remove the second two from add
202:42 - oh
202:44 - will that work oh that's a good one
202:48 - that's a good one
202:52 - okay i just need two more characters
202:54 - this can be done
202:55 - right two more characters
203:09 - nope really doesn't want to give me any
203:12 - defaults for hsb
203:22 - i and oh
203:26 - this this is a good i yeah i've been
203:29 - trying
203:30 - this i agree that that should work
203:42 - no
203:44 - there should be a way for me to get 0 1
203:47 - 1 0
203:50 - that sequence but i'm not sure how the
203:53 - suggestions that i've gotten don't seem
203:55 - to work
203:57 - um
204:02 - line 10 remove the last item on the list
204:05 - says marcos
204:14 - i really don't need that zero
204:19 - that's amazing it'll default that's
204:21 - amazing
204:23 - that is totally amazing
204:27 - replace line 10 replace this with times
204:30 - two yeah
204:34 - no that is cool looking though
204:38 - uh what did i do it
