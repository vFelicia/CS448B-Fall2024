00:00 - Dan and I am broadcasting live from the
00:03 - school for poetic computation
00:06 - on uh Tuesday March
00:09 - 22nd it's not really the morning anymore
00:11 - it's about 11:20 a.m. I'm here um
00:15 - hopefully you can hear me hopefully you
00:16 - can see me I've got some new lights set
00:18 - up so I think the picture quality should
00:20 - be a bit better the keying from the
00:22 - green screen should be a bit better
00:23 - please let me know in the chat how it
00:25 - looks how it sounds um I'm still kind of
00:28 - in a phase of kind of testing this setup
00:31 - and getting it configured so I like not
00:33 - really prepared which is why I'm kind of
00:35 - stream of conscious rambling here but I
00:37 - do have some stuff I want to do today uh
00:39 - in addition to just kind of talk and
00:42 - answer any questions but on my list is
00:45 - I've been meeting for a long time I made
00:47 - a whole set of video tutorials about
00:48 - making a Twitter pot Twitter pot a
00:51 - Twitter bot using node.js so I finally
00:54 - want to look at some strategies for
00:55 - deploying that bot to a server we can
00:58 - look at how you can deploy it to Heroku
00:59 - or an Amazon ec2 instance or discuss
01:02 - other possibilities oh Cloud9 is another
01:04 - one you can use I think for free I
01:06 - should maybe look at that um as well as
01:08 - actually just running your Bot on a
01:09 - Raspberry Pi so I want to not really I'm
01:12 - going to pull out a Raspberry Pi and see
01:13 - if I can even hook it up into the system
01:15 - and have it behind me and see what we
01:17 - can kind of like FS futs with it Fitz
01:19 - with it fuddle with it I don't know what
01:22 - you do with a Raspberry Pi
01:25 - you program it you make it do stuff um
01:29 - but um so I don't know I'm going to hang
01:30 - out here for an hour or two and kind of
01:32 - do this stuff if I get a good if I have
01:35 - a good like chunk of something I'm going
01:36 - to record that separately as a video
01:38 - tutorial that will get all this will get
01:40 - saved but I'm looking to make in the
01:42 - next hour or two while I'm fussing
01:44 - around also make some video tutorials so
01:47 - I'm looking in the chat um do I look I
01:51 - don't know if I I noticed the way I had
01:53 - the white balance on the camera I was
01:55 - very like pale the other day now I look
01:57 - a little bit orange but um
02:00 - if uh if you wouldn't mind letting me
02:02 - know how the picture quality is and how
02:03 - the sound is that would be helpful to me
02:05 - before I get kind of started
02:07 - here um okay so let's
02:13 - see
02:16 - uh yeah I got some folders on the
02:18 - desktop here all right
02:22 - um does that make a weird noise like a
02:25 - slurping
02:26 - noise um okay so picture and sound are
02:29 - good seems perfect perfect great okay
02:31 - thanks for the feedback so I'm going to
02:33 - get started then um let's see what we
02:36 - can do first here let me
02:38 - revisit um and try to get so here's the
02:42 - thing I'm kind of doing my strategy for
02:45 - today is rather than like prepare and
02:48 - then turn on the stream and be prepared
02:50 - I'm just gonna prepare while I'm
02:52 - streaming so I think the first thing I'm
02:54 - going to do is kind of get myself back
02:56 - to um some of those bot examples um so
03:00 - I'm going to open up
03:02 - Sublime uh and I'm going to go here to
03:07 - the
03:08 - finder uh and see if I can figure out
03:11 - where where are all the where are all
03:13 - those oh documents yeah uh data
03:17 - apis
03:19 - arrays other R of code video notes where
03:22 - are all the bot examples other
03:26 - documents this is not going well so far
03:29 - uh uh hold on let's look let's try this
03:32 - bot.
03:33 - JS okay ah they're definitely
03:36 - somewhere um let me see these things in
03:39 - the finder uh old desktop old YouTube
03:42 - code Old this is brilliant brilliant
03:46 - file naming here documents old desktop
03:48 - old YouTube code but that's what I'm
03:50 - looking for so I'm going to grab those
03:51 - things old desktop old YouTube code uh
03:56 - so let's grab I'm going to move this
03:57 - stuff to the desktop here and and drag
04:00 - this into here uh so this was a bunch of
04:04 - my old bot
04:06 - examples um oh unregistered Sublime Text
04:10 - I have purchased Sublime Text but I
04:12 - guess because I made a different user
04:14 - account on this
04:15 - machine uh
04:18 - um I see somebody wrote in the comment
04:21 - image could be sharper I'm assuming
04:24 - that's just the sort of compression of
04:26 - the internet speed um it is I am I am
04:30 - streaming this out in 720p I was
04:32 - reluctant to try to do it higher but
04:34 - anybody else let me know if it seems
04:36 - like you have trouble um seeing anything
04:38 - um okay uh let's see here let's just
04:42 - find a very simple
04:44 - example which just uh let's look for the
04:48 - like this one I think maybe uh this one
04:51 - does a random number uh every what's 20
04:55 - times a th000 every 20 seconds
05:01 - um
05:03 - and um somebody asks why not use adom IO
05:07 - text editor no reason I just happened to
05:10 - using Sublime here um that would be that
05:13 - would also be a good one for me to use
05:15 - um so I think this will work here as a
05:18 - demonstration to start with um let me
05:23 - open up terminal
05:25 - now
05:28 - uh
05:30 - uh well where am I here in terminal here
05:33 - oh my
05:34 - goodness
05:38 - uh and I'm in this
05:42 - one I have no idea and I think the the
05:46 - good question another question here is
05:48 - what is this example hooked up
05:51 - to Twitter am I logged in to uh no I'm
05:55 - logged into to who myself let's let's
05:59 - log out
06:00 - out that now you all saw my Twitter
06:04 - page let's log into ITP
06:08 - A2Z I try to remember the password which
06:11 - is my test Twitter account no oh wait
06:15 - first of all let's even see if that's
06:17 - the right account name ITP A2Z
06:20 - no A2Z
06:23 - ITP yes okay log
06:27 - in uh what did I say it was A2 Z ITP uh
06:31 - interact oops I just said the password
06:34 - out
06:34 - loud uh I don't know should I save it
06:37 - what do you guys think oh I feel so
06:38 - stressed out when I get these queries
06:40 - let's not save it let's not save it bad
06:42 - idea bad idea okay um so now let's run
06:45 - this
06:46 - bot
06:49 - uh bot is starting it
06:52 - worked yeah there we go this is a tweet
06:55 - we just made 3 seconds ago random number
06:58 - 39 the number of the day isn't that
07:01 - that's a Sesame Street thing right the
07:03 - number of today is
07:04 - 39 uh okay and we've got our random
07:08 - number bot and so I think I have all the
07:12 - pieces here now I have a browser Page
07:16 - open to the
07:18 - twitterbot I have Sublime Text open to
07:23 - the code for the
07:25 - twitterbot there it is and I have also
07:28 - terminal now
07:30 - uh in the directory for that Twitter bot
07:33 - so I can run things and I don't need the
07:36 - activity monitor and Etc I don't need
07:39 - this oh I I am going to need this ah
07:41 - yeah when we get to the Amazon thing
07:43 - okay do I have cyberduck here somewhere
07:46 - yep okay we're going to use that for
07:48 - ftping files uh am I logged into some
07:52 - sort of get something like that okay um
07:57 - so let's see here let me look um
08:00 - there are 28 people watching hello so a
08:02 - lot of people seem to have just joined
08:03 - I'm just getting set up here the things
08:06 - that I wanted to talk about today are
08:08 - how to deploy your twitterbot uh and as
08:11 - well as look at a Raspberry Pi let's
08:13 - should we try should I try let me get my
08:16 - res I got to leave for a second not
08:18 - really leave not really I'm in a place
08:20 - I'm in this like kind of underground
08:21 - bunker it's not underground at all it's
08:23 - like a room with no windows uh but
08:26 - there's a room with Windows right over
08:27 - there I can go get a little sunshine
08:30 - um but over in that room over there I
08:31 - left a raspberry piie so I need to just
08:34 - walk over there and get it be right back
08:36 - there's lots of things here I could trip
08:37 - over so I have to do this very
08:40 - carefully be right back oh you can still
08:42 - hear me though because I got a live mic
08:44 - going on here so I'm in the other room
08:46 - you can't see me now and it I can't find
08:49 - the raspberry Pine oh you know why
08:52 - because I already brought it in
08:54 - here cuz I'm a lunatic oh and you know
08:56 - what a light went out um one of my
08:58 - lights went out probably because I
08:59 - stepped on the cable now it's on it just
09:02 - shined in my eyes Okay um so let's talk
09:05 - about the Raspberry Pi for a
09:08 - second
09:10 - so here's the thing if you've made so if
09:14 - you've made a
09:16 - twitterbot and if you've made it using
09:18 - node or whatever you made it with you
09:20 - now have the ability as we just saw to
09:23 - on your own
09:25 - computer run that tter oh this the font
09:28 - should be bigger
09:30 - here so you can see that to run
09:40 - it there we go right you have the
09:42 - ability to run it and you could just let
09:44 - that twitterbot run but uh if this is
09:48 - your laptop eventually you want to close
09:50 - it you want to shut it down you need
09:51 - some place where it can run permanently
09:53 - and your options could be like okay well
09:55 - you could dedicate a computer sitting in
09:57 - your home or office or wherever you have
09:58 - your your computer to running your Bot
10:01 - but that might be a little bit
10:03 - unreasonable um you know it's kind of an
10:05 - expensive thing to dedicate an entire
10:07 - computer just for a bot so one of the
10:09 - nice things you can do I have a box
10:13 - here hey
10:15 - props I have in here a Raspberry Pi I
10:20 - show it to the C this won't this will be
10:22 - out of focus uh a Raspberry Pi a
10:25 - Raspberry Pi is a small computer it
10:29 - looks like this I actually have a little
10:30 - camera hooked up to it which I will at
10:32 - some point see if I can get working um I
10:35 - happen to have also a little um I need
10:38 - another camera to like close up on this
10:40 - I happen to have a little um what what
10:43 - do you call this wi-fi thing dongle USB
10:46 - Wi-Fi thing so this can connect to the
10:48 - internet of course I could just plug it
10:50 - directly into ethernet um and this is
10:53 - computer this is running a Linux
10:55 - operating system there's a little micro
10:57 - SD card in here um which is has the
11:01 - Raspberry Pi uh has the Linux operating
11:03 - system on it um it's running that and
11:07 - that can run node so this being only $35
11:11 - is a much more reasonable thing to leave
11:13 - dedicated to running your Bot so that is
11:17 - one option and I would like to maybe I'm
11:20 - not going to do this right now set this
11:22 - up I'm going to try to outp get the HDMI
11:25 - output of this or actually I don't even
11:27 - need that because if I'm just going to
11:29 - could log into it I don't know what I'm
11:30 - doing yet but I'm going to set this up
11:32 - and show you guys some stuff with the
11:33 - Raspberry Pi but maybe we should move
11:36 - on um uh maybe we should move on and I'm
11:40 - going to look at some options for
11:42 - deploying this bot to servers so let's
11:46 - think about what some oh this light does
11:48 - not stay
11:50 - on why is that hold on maybe I need a
11:52 - piece of tape here why is it Loose hold
11:54 - on I'm going to work on
11:57 - this light over here okay come on there
12:01 - we
12:05 - go there we go all right um
12:12 - so uh oh I've lost a lot of viewers I
12:15 - was up to like 30 30 some viewers now
12:18 - there's only 23 of you watching but
12:19 - that's nice okay so what I want to do is
12:21 - look up here um I have some notes on
12:25 - this which I will show you where those
12:27 - are uh um uh shi.
12:32 - github.io A2Z F15 so if
12:36 - you
12:39 - A2Z df15 okay if you go to this URL I
12:44 - have some notes on how to deploy your
12:46 - Bot to both Heroku which is a company
12:51 - that runs
12:52 - servers that you can get an account on
12:55 - um and actually you can run your
12:57 - twitterbot on Heroku for free as far as
13:00 - I can tell I've been I've I've been able
13:01 - to do that I'm going to show you that um
13:04 - obviously if you want to do more
13:05 - sophisticated things you'll probably
13:06 - need a paid account for Heroku so we'll
13:08 - look at that briefly um and um so on
13:13 - this page I have um two uh two links
13:17 - here of notes one is a page of notes on
13:20 - how to deploy your Bot to ec2 and
13:22 - another is a page of notes of how to
13:24 - deploy your Bot to Heroku so I'm going
13:26 - to open this up and and uh you can see
13:30 - the and what I'm going to do is you can
13:32 - kind of like see the basic instructions
13:34 - here but I'm going to walk through them
13:36 - and I'm going to then I'm going to hit
13:37 - record so maybe this first video that
13:39 - I'm going to do is will be called how to
13:42 - deploy your nodejs Bot to Heroku when
13:47 - when I woke up this morning is that
13:48 - really what I thought I was going to do
13:49 - with my day was come here and talk to
13:51 - myself in a room with a wall painted
13:54 - green about deploying a node bot to
13:57 - Heroku anyway such is my life you're the
14:01 - you your life is to watch this of course
14:04 - you you you you have free will and can
14:06 - turn this off and go to the sunshine I
14:08 - will stay here in my dark
14:11 - room okay so um I'm going to do a couple
14:14 - things one is
14:17 - um ah hello tun I see hello Andrew uh oh
14:21 - Andrew Kim writes in the chat by the way
14:23 - Twitter Bots are estimated to create
14:25 - approximately 24% of tweets that are on
14:27 - Twitter is that really true
14:29 - well we are only adding to the problem
14:31 - if that's the case so I want to get my
14:32 - notes open on this I have a second La my
14:35 - my my second labtop over here uh so
14:39 - shiftman
14:41 - github.io um
14:43 - slash uh A2 z-
14:47 - F15 and I'm going to go to
14:51 - um the I'm gonna start with Heroku up
14:54 - the camera just went off I'm going to
14:55 - walk around here and turn it back on
14:57 - sorry about that I also got to check the
15:00 - I'm in a bit of a battery situation
15:03 - which is that uh I I'm running this lav
15:07 - mic and the receiver for the lav mic off
15:09 - doublea batteries and I kind of um those
15:12 - might run out which Cas I might have to
15:14 - pause and go out and get some batteries
15:15 - but uh we'll see I still got a full bar
15:18 - so I think it's going to last for a
15:19 - little while okay so um okay
15:24 - so what I want to check here is okay
15:29 - good that's not installed so I need to
15:31 - install this Heroku tool belt and the
15:35 - one thing I need to make sure I can
15:37 - do uh is make sure I can log into Heroku
15:41 - here uh so I'm going to log in uh make
15:45 - sure I know my
15:48 - password so sad I use one password and
15:52 - I'm just don't have it ah I was lucky
15:54 - okay uh let's not save it I probably
15:56 - should save it I don't know what's
15:57 - happening anymore okay the boy look at
15:59 - all of these tests test test delete soon
16:02 - this is my brilliant bot test delete
16:05 - soon test Twitter bot test think I
16:07 - should delete some of these can I delete
16:09 - them very quickly uh it's probably going
16:11 - to take me a while we'll just make
16:12 - another test it's fine okay so I think
16:15 - I'm ready for the first tutorial for
16:17 - today it only took me 16 minutes to get
16:20 - to that and the first tutorial I'm going
16:22 - to do is deploying your twitterbot to
16:26 - Heroku and I probably should practice
16:29 - this before I hit record but I could
16:30 - always do it twice and whatever anyway
16:33 - so I'm going to check the chat to make
16:35 - sure everybody can still hear me and
16:37 - everything looks okay um uh hello to
16:41 - more of you who are saying hello in the
16:43 - chat I love this purple color I got to
16:45 - change my desktop background to like a
16:47 - nice purple or
16:49 - something um um hello to brother rain uh
16:54 - in the chat uh I gained a viewer I was
16:57 - losing people through my rambling but uh
17:00 - once I started like holding up a prop
17:02 - and had this like Raspberry p and I was
17:04 - trying to I don't know okay so uh we're
17:07 - gonna do this so
17:11 - um so I've got just to revisit this I've
17:15 - got
17:19 - oops I don't need this here or maybe I
17:22 - do uh I've
17:25 - got my Twitter page open for viewing if
17:29 - the bot works I have got I'm logged into
17:33 - my Heroku
17:34 - dashboard I have got the code for this
17:38 - particular bot open and I also have
17:41 - terminal in the directory for the bot
17:45 - okay so I think I'm
17:47 - ready here we go so now I have to come
17:49 - over
17:50 - here and I'm going to hit record I'm
17:53 - going to have a little sip of this uh
17:55 - I'm having coffee today instead of tea
17:57 - which is very dangerous since I have
17:58 - like a sort of a hyper energy problem
18:02 - anyway but what can you do okay here we
18:06 - go hello in this video I'm going to look
18:10 - I got to start over I have this on the
18:11 - wrong
18:12 - page uh okay tur this over here okay uh
18:16 - and then I'm going to make this
18:17 - bigger
18:21 - uh
18:25 - okay okay uh
18:29 - [Music]
18:30 - here we go uh stop I'm gonna try this
18:35 - again hello in this video I am going to
18:38 - look at how you can take a twitterbot
18:41 - written in node.js and deploy it to a
18:44 - server and the server I will look at in
18:46 - this video is one that runs on Heroku so
18:50 - what are the pieces of this the first
18:51 - thing is I have this simple little bot
18:54 - which just tweets a random number you
18:56 - can see I just ran this bot and tested
18:58 - it over here uh and you can see there's
19:00 - the random number it picked random
19:02 - number 39 uh and I also have um the my
19:07 - browser logged into Heroku
19:11 - so shoot I have to start over I have to
19:13 - start over sorry I got I I I I had this
19:17 - in the wrong page uh this code and
19:20 - terminal okay okay here we go I'm going
19:23 - to start over
19:26 - again um
19:30 - record
19:31 - hello
19:33 - hello hello my name is
19:38 - Dan hello in this video I am going to
19:41 - look at how to deploy your Bot written
19:43 - in no JS to uh a server and that server
19:47 - being one that runs on a service called
19:49 - Heroku so let's take a look at the
19:50 - pieces so you can see here I have my
19:52 - browser open to my test account A2Z ITP
19:56 - which uh I most recently just tweeted a
19:59 - bot tweeted a random number 39 and I
20:02 - have the code for that bot open right
20:05 - here you can see it in Sublime it's very
20:06 - simple it has a single function that
20:08 - tweets that random number uh and then I
20:11 - also have my terminal open to that
20:14 - directory and I could just really
20:16 - quickly test to make sure that bot works
20:18 - the bot is starting it worked let's go
20:21 - back to the browser I'm gonna hit
20:22 - refresh and we can see now I got random
20:25 - number four so everything is working the
20:28 - point is in this video is I want to say
20:30 - this bot that's running right over here
20:33 - I don't want to run it from my laptop I
20:35 - want it to run autonomously on a server
20:37 - somewhere that I can set it to go and
20:39 - never think about it again so let's
20:41 - tweet it again let's quit it um and look
20:43 - at how we can do that so the site that
20:45 - I'm the the service that I'm going to
20:47 - use in this particular video is Heroku
20:50 - so um you'll need an account so you know
20:52 - if you're watching this video and you
20:54 - don't have a Heroku account go to uh
20:56 - Heroku dcom
20:59 - Heroku spelled this way.com
21:03 - and you can see here I went there now
21:06 - now I'm already logged in so it went
21:08 - straight to my dashboard and you can see
21:12 - that I have all these things already
21:14 - listed on my dashboard because
21:15 - apparently I've tried to make a variety
21:18 - of I've tried to do this a whole bunch
21:19 - of time test this test that delete soon
21:22 - Etc so what are these things these
21:24 - things are referred to as
21:27 - dinos I think that's right not Dino DS
21:30 - Dino Dy NS like a dynamic thing that's
21:34 - running it's a process that you're
21:35 - running so what I need to do is create a
21:38 - dyo um to run my bot so the very first
21:43 - thing that I'm going to do is go up here
21:44 - to this plus sign up in the top right
21:47 - and I'm going to say create new app so
21:50 - app is really what I'm doing I'm going
21:51 - to create an app I'm going to call it uh
21:55 - coding rainbow uh demo
21:59 - uh should only contain lowercase letters
22:01 - okay rainbow demo uh it is available I'm
22:05 - going to create
22:07 - it and it is now there so there's a
22:11 - whole bunch of things I need to do here
22:13 - and one of the things about using
22:15 - Heroku is Heroku is kind of its own
22:18 - animal it's not really an animal it's a
22:20 - web server but whatever it's it's its
22:22 - own it has its own way of doing things
22:24 - and the way that you send things to
22:26 - Heroku and get things back from Heroku
22:28 - is two ways one is you use git what is
22:32 - git oh boy if you don't know what git is
22:33 - stay tuned for my upcoming set of git
22:36 - and GitHub tutorials but for now if you
22:38 - don't know what git is um you're going
22:41 - to be you'll still be able to follow
22:42 - this but you're just going to have to
22:44 - verbatim kind of
22:45 - copy I heard a
22:48 - noise there's a person somewhere nearby
22:52 - I have to keep going anyway okay um uh
22:55 - you can just sort of verbatim copy um
22:57 - some of these uh
23:01 - commands um okay so now I'm waving to
23:05 - somebody who uh it's my my neighbor Joe
23:07 - I love Joe he's a great guy uh he came
23:10 - and said hi the other day okay I got to
23:12 - keep going here so um so you can see
23:14 - here that on the Heroku page it's even
23:17 - giving you some sort of commands that
23:18 - you can follow we'll worry about that in
23:20 - a moment but we're missing one other
23:23 - aspect here the first thing that it's
23:25 - saying to do is saying herok login
23:28 - meaning log into your Heroku account
23:31 - from terminal somehow so if I go over
23:33 - here and I type in Heroku
23:36 - login it says command not found so one
23:39 - of the things you need in order to work
23:41 - with Heroku is a piece of software
23:43 - called the Heroku tool belt so I
23:46 - probably should have pre-installed that
23:48 - but I'm just going to Google Heroku tool
23:51 - belt I'm going to click on the first
23:53 - thing that comes up and I'm going to
23:55 - download it and I think it's going to
23:57 - this is going to happen quickly enough
23:58 - that I can just do this I'm going to
24:01 - install it continue continue
24:05 - install uh password and there we go I'm
24:09 - installing it I do my installing
24:15 - dance I don't know I I didn't I like the
24:19 - weird thing about me doing this dance
24:20 - while this video is going I have a
24:22 - preview screen I'm like watching myself
24:23 - over here I supposed to just dancing to
24:25 - the camera that was very weird I will
24:27 - edit that out that no one that someone
24:29 - will make a weird GI out of that or
24:31 - something okay so now I should be able
24:34 - to go
24:35 - back and type in Heroku look at that oh
24:38 - installing tool I didn't even know it
24:40 - was going to do that so maybe you have
24:42 - to do that I was about to just say
24:43 - Heroku log in but I just was typing
24:46 - Heroku to make sure it works apparently
24:47 - I have to do another dance because it's
24:50 - installing a bunch of stuff oh that was
24:53 - I don't have to dance okay so now we can
24:56 - see um I should be able to say Heroku
24:58 - login and it should ask for my
25:01 - credentials my account is under my email
25:04 - my password
25:06 - [Music]
25:08 - is ah I'm logged in so now that I'm
25:11 - logged in I can actually start to do
25:13 - things which would allow me to deploy uh
25:17 - from terminal here all the stuff for my
25:20 - bot to Heroku itself so let's go back
25:25 - now to this p
25:29 - page and uh oh actually this page no
25:33 - this page sorry and we can see here
25:39 - now now that I've logged into Heroku the
25:42 - next thing I need to do is make my uh
25:47 - bot into a git repository again the what
25:51 - git is if you're not familiar with it is
25:53 - out of the scope of this particular
25:55 - video but it's um version Control
25:58 - software and uh what it's going to allow
26:02 - me to do is once I turn it into a git
26:04 - repository meaning all the code for my
26:07 - bot is in this folder it's going to
26:09 - allow me to push that git repository to
26:11 - Heroku because everything that lives on
26:13 - Heroku is also a g repository so I'm
26:16 - going to be able to follow these
26:17 - commands the first thing I'm going to do
26:18 - is say get
26:20 - AIT get
26:23 - init and it initialized an empty git
26:25 - reposit now if you get if I type got by
26:28 - the way instead of git it's going to say
26:30 - got command not found if you get this
26:33 - error meaning get command not found this
26:36 - just means you need to download and
26:38 - install git so if I Google git the very
26:41 - first thing that comes up is this
26:43 - particular website
26:56 - g-.& reason you didn't have that already
26:59 - okay now that I've done that the next
27:02 - command that I need to go to is this
27:06 - Heroku git remote- a so what I'm doing
27:09 - is I'm saying I want my git repository
27:12 - this thing that lives on my computer I
27:14 - want it to be linked to a remote place
27:17 - that remote place far off in the
27:19 - distance is Heroku and I not just want
27:21 - to link it to Heroku but I want to link
27:23 - it to my app that's coding rainbow demo
27:26 - so I can just take exactly this here and
27:31 - I can type put that into terminal I see
27:33 - it over here on my preview screen and
27:36 - there we go it's all set now and
27:39 - then I can go here and I can say the
27:44 - next thing okay so the next set of
27:46 - commands here is now I actually want to
27:49 - send the stuff to Heroku the way that
27:51 - you send stuff to Heroku is with a
27:53 - command a get command called push in git
27:56 - push means send pull means receive so
28:00 - there's a there's there's a lot to
28:02 - there's a lot to this but I first thing
28:03 - I need to do is like add and commit and
28:05 - so I'm just going to follow these
28:06 - commands I someday this will link to my
28:09 - get tutorials which will explain all
28:11 - these commands so I'm going to say get
28:12 - add and then I'm just going to use
28:14 - exactly I'm going to say commit get
28:17 - commit D am make it better this I could
28:19 - put my own comment in here I'm going to
28:21 - say uh oh and you can't this needs to
28:24 - move like a little bit over here I'm
28:25 - going to say uh
28:28 - this is my
28:29 - bot and it did that and then I'm going
28:32 - to say get push Heroku
28:36 - Master get push Heroku Master which will
28:40 - send it so now it's sending it to Heroku
28:43 - and it's going to do all sorts of stuff
28:44 - to try to run
28:46 - it the thing is I missed some steps so
28:50 - these would have been the steps if I had
28:52 - a kind of traditional
28:54 - old-fashioned uh web application you
28:56 - know I made some sort of server it
28:58 - serves up web pages people log onto my
29:00 - server they see the web pages but that's
29:02 - not actually what I made I made this bot
29:04 - which is just this process that needs to
29:06 - run behind the scenes uh with no there's
29:09 - no web server there's no place there's
29:10 - no URL for anyone to go to I just want
29:12 - this thing to run on the server so I
29:13 - have over here I'm just want to make
29:15 - sure I get the syntax right my notes um
29:19 - and uh okay so in order to do this I'm
29:23 - missing a particular piece so first
29:27 - thing I want to do actually by the way I
29:29 - really should have practiced this in
29:30 - advance but this is fine so there's so
29:33 - let's here we are we' kind we've got
29:35 - okay what have we done so far we wrote
29:37 - the code for our bot we pushed it to
29:39 - Heroku and we and it even just sort of
29:41 - said verifying deploy done it didn't
29:43 - give me any error messages so let's
29:44 - actually go and look now I'm going to go
29:47 - back to uh my
29:49 - dashboard and I should see here I should
29:52 - be able to find oh yeah sorry whoops I
29:54 - should be able to find coding rainbow
29:56 - demo I'm going to click on that and
29:59 - we're going to see um it says sleeping
30:03 - so it's not really working it's not
30:05 - really doing anything yet the reason
30:07 - it's not doing anything yet is because
30:10 - it is listed as a web app I need to
30:14 - change this to be what's called a worker
30:17 - app and that's what I was talking about
30:18 - a worker is a web app is something that
30:20 - serves up web pages a worker is
30:22 - something that just works behind the
30:23 - scenes with its own process and that's
30:25 - what the bot is so in order to do that I
30:28 - need to go back to my code here and I
30:31 - actually need to create a new file so
30:33 - this is my folder with all the stuff and
30:36 - I need to create a new file and I need
30:38 - that file to be
30:40 - called I'm going to save it uh
30:44 - P file proc file this is the process
30:48 - file it's a configuration file that
30:50 - Heroku will look for to know what is it
30:53 - that this thing is supposed to do so I'm
30:55 - going to save that and in that file I'm
30:57 - going to say this thing is actually a
30:59 - worker not not a web application and it
31:03 - its job is to run node bot. js so I'm
31:08 - going to save that in there and then I
31:11 - have got to go back and this is again um
31:15 - if you're unfamiliar with Git I here's
31:18 - the thing I need to I made some changes
31:20 - to my project now I need those changes
31:23 - to go onto Heroku those changes are only
31:25 - locally on my laptop so to do that I
31:27 - need to say get add dot this is adding
31:30 - my changes and I need to say commit
31:33 - which is giving a message to those which
31:35 - is adding the proc file you can follow
31:39 - along those this is the same things I
31:41 - did for the first one and then I can say
31:43 - get push Heroku Master this is sending
31:46 - it to Heroku Master Heroku is our
31:51 - Master uh and now that done it's
31:56 - finished
31:58 - uh as I do my little dance I have to
32:01 - wait for all this to finish launching
32:04 - verifying deploy Etc now I should be
32:07 - able to go here and hit
32:10 - refresh and I see now I see look at that
32:13 - it says worker node bot. js and this I
32:17 - want to turn off I need to hit edit I
32:19 - want to turn off the
32:22 - web the web process confirm and I want
32:26 - to turn on
32:27 - the worker one
32:30 - confirm and
32:32 - now as far as I
32:35 - know oh my goodness boy we we sent a lot
32:38 - of
32:39 - tweets um you can see now it's uh you
32:42 - can see it's it's running now so it was
32:44 - probably running it's it's interesting
32:46 - that it actually worked maybe earlier
32:48 - but now it should be running every 20
32:50 - seconds it should um post a new tweet
32:53 - and we should be able to see this by the
32:55 - way uh if I back here say Heroku
32:59 - log uh oh what I meant log is not a
33:02 - command perhaps I meant logs and in fact
33:05 - yes I meant
33:06 - logs uh
33:08 - Heroku
33:11 - logs and you can see by the way this is
33:14 - running because there's two new
33:16 - tweets uh and here uh it
33:22 - worked right so
33:25 - um this is oh yeah so you can see by the
33:28 - way there's a bunch of things going on
33:30 - here because I let it run as a web thing
33:33 - the first time and the web thing has an
33:35 - error it stopped but you can see the
33:37 - worker thing is just saying it worked it
33:39 - worked it worked so I don't know if 20
33:41 - seconds has passed but if I do this
33:44 - again look at the logs you can see the
33:45 - worker is still going so um I'm actually
33:48 - going to shut it off um because I have
33:51 - it set to like tweet every 20 seconds
33:53 - which is pretty often but you can see
33:54 - that this works so now my bot is
33:56 - deployed on Heroku and by the way free
33:59 - account free Heroku account um to to do
34:02 - this so um so you don't this you not
34:05 - need a paid Heroku account to Simply run
34:07 - run a an app with a worker process so
34:10 - hopefully this was helpful to you this
34:12 - is about a 15 minutes of the steps um
34:15 - what I'm going to do in the video's
34:17 - description is uh kind of paste links to
34:20 - all the pieces you need to download uh
34:23 - I'll have links to all the pieces you
34:24 - need to download I also have this that I
34:27 - ran through as a written tutorial so I
34:28 - will post a link to that as well um and
34:32 - uh but before I go away I'm just going
34:35 - to show you how I could shut it off if I
34:36 - want to so I could hit edit here I could
34:39 - turn this off and hit confirm so now my
34:42 - bot uh even though it did four more
34:45 - random numbers it should have stopped
34:47 - now and it won't do any more random
34:48 - numbers I've shut it off right now so uh
34:51 - that was that concludes our discussion
34:53 - of how to deploy your no dutchs bot to
34:58 - Heroku over here I'm gonna hit
35:02 - stop okay so I'm now GNA uh I don't know
35:05 - if anyone's still watching the live
35:06 - stream I'm going to come back here and
35:10 - look at the live
35:11 - dashboard um
35:15 - and uh some people said hi okay there 25
35:18 - of you watching how was that did that
35:21 - make sense I'm like tempted to just like
35:23 - redo that whole video cuz I was like
35:24 - didn't know what was happening but but
35:27 - um hopefully that was okay up this light
35:30 - keeps going you know the key seems to be
35:31 - fine even with this light going out
35:34 - um I don't know whether it's a power
35:37 - issue or it's just loose like if I
35:39 - squeeze it the light goes on can you see
35:41 - that there's a light going on and off
35:42 - yeah probably can
35:45 - um let me hold
35:47 - on let me take some more drastic
35:50 - measures here I have a feeling that this
35:53 - just is not in tightly
35:55 - enough
36:00 - okay sorry I just want to fix this
36:09 - light hello
36:12 - everyone
36:15 - hello sorry ah there we go I'm I'm I
36:20 - will be back talking to you
36:22 - momentarily there we go that seems more
36:25 - that seems better now
36:28 - okay seems to be staying on okay um
36:31 - hello again so let's see
36:35 - uh so uh Andrew writes uh what kinds of
36:39 - things do you have to pay Heroku to be
36:40 - able to do to be honest with you I'm not
36:42 - that much of an expert on Heroku but I
36:44 - know for a fact that I use it for um so
36:48 - one thing I use n Heroku for if I go to
36:50 - natureof code.com
36:52 - because I'm inadvertently plugging this
36:55 - um and I click buy now you'll notice
36:57 - actually the URL takes you to here so
37:00 - it's actually I'm running a server on
37:01 - Heroku to run this uh purchasing system
37:05 - uh which by the way you can you can
37:06 - download it for free but um so but I
37:09 - have a database that stores a record of
37:11 - every purchase and I have to have a paid
37:14 - account in order to have that database
37:15 - so that's one thing certainly I think to
37:17 - use a database probably it also was I
37:20 - would imagine related to how much
37:21 - bandwidth you get uh server space you
37:24 - get those types of things uh also how
37:26 - many different like apps you can run
37:28 - probably also is related to um whether
37:31 - you have a paid or a free
37:33 - account um okay uh that was one question
37:36 - uh another question is so that is for
37:38 - JavaScript based bots so you could
37:40 - deploy non-javascript based Bots to
37:42 - Heroku whatever runs on Heroku you can
37:45 - run the thing that I have not been able
37:47 - to do with Heroku is run a bot that one
37:51 - um you know I made these tutorials so
37:52 - long ago but um the bot tutorials if you
37:55 - go through them look at doing just a
37:57 - text based bot and then an image-based
37:59 - bot and the image based bot uses then
38:02 - processing which runs a Java program to
38:05 - do the image stuff so I have not been
38:07 - able to run Java uh Java with the
38:10 - JavaScript node bot on Heroku but I have
38:12 - been able to do that on Amazon ec2 which
38:15 - is what I also want to show uh next in
38:18 - this session
38:19 - today what about Windows users I guess
38:22 - the console commands are similar uh
38:24 - Leander R asks uh correct uh for Windows
38:29 - users you just need your
38:31 - own uh everything is the same uh you
38:35 - just need to have like sigin or
38:37 - Powershell or even like git bash is a
38:40 - tool you can download to have uh console
38:43 - command line access to your Windows
38:44 - machine but otherwise it's exactly the
38:46 - same um
38:48 - yeah um okay any other questions um I'm
38:53 - going to start getting ready here to
38:55 - look at
38:57 - Amazon
38:59 - ec2
39:01 - uh um okay
39:04 - Amazon okay so first thing I want to do
39:06 - is go to shiftman GitHub so I also have
39:09 - some notes here oh yeah
39:14 - um so I'm going to go through this
39:18 - now uh one of the tricky things
39:23 - was oh my God
39:27 - this is like totally insane I'm going to
39:28 - leave this open on this machine um so
39:32 - I'm going to go through the ec2 stuff
39:34 - the tricky thing is getting to log in I
39:40 - think I'm just going to like hope that
39:41 - this I can make this
39:43 - work
39:46 - um yeah so let me go let me just see
39:49 - though if
39:51 - whoops
39:53 - um why is this
39:55 - URL not
39:58 - correct uh let me fix
40:00 - this uh so hold
40:04 - on I'm going to fix that URL on that
40:07 - tutorial
40:08 - page um
40:14 - still um post your questions in the chat
40:17 - while I'm and I will answer them in a
40:20 - moment while I'm getting here where
40:22 - where was that week
40:24 - nine ec2
40:28 - ec2 uh edit I don't know why this oh wh
40:32 - I have this
40:35 - backwards in the
40:37 - brackets should be Amazon
40:46 - ec2 so this should eventually
40:50 - update
40:53 - um okay um
40:59 - uh okay
41:03 - uh oh interesting somebody writes in the
41:06 - chat I I'm I'm sorry I would love to
41:08 - know how to pronounce your name Goa
41:10 - tasan writes uh for web apps Heroku used
41:13 - to be very generous with their offer now
41:16 - free Dino is limited to run maximum of
41:18 - 18 hours during a 24 hours window that's
41:21 - interesting I was not aware of that so
41:23 - it might be the case that um this might
41:26 - not be the best uh it be interesting to
41:28 - see as you guys try deploying with a
41:30 - free account if it lets you run your Bot
41:32 - 24 hours a day um you know you might be
41:34 - fine if your Bot as a worker process
41:37 - only does something like once every hour
41:40 - um but uh be curious and then uh Cy
41:43 - writes as a non webd what does Heroku do
41:47 - well
41:48 - Heroku I'm I'm really the wrong person
41:50 - to be I should just not be here making
41:53 - these videos cuz there are certain
41:54 - things I really I'm also a non webdev as
41:58 - a non- webdev I will now attempt to make
42:00 - up an answer for that question but I I
42:02 - I'll give you my sense of it those of
42:04 - you who I'm sure know this better will
42:05 - write in the chat but oroku is a uh
42:08 - server um uh that you get to have an
42:11 - account on and a server is just a
42:13 - computer that can run programs now for
42:15 - the most part the kinds of programs you
42:17 - want to run are those that serve web
42:19 - pages but as I'm showing you here any
42:22 - program that you can run you can run on
42:25 - your Heroku inst the thing about Heroku
42:27 - is they have their own way of doing
42:29 - things which is a little nonstandard
42:31 - it's a little different than I just have
42:33 - a computer that's plugged into the
42:34 - internet that I can log into and put
42:36 - files on they want you to use their
42:37 - Heroku tool belt software and you have
42:39 - to send things using git so there's it's
42:42 - Heroku is a um Heroku has a kind of High
42:47 - um sort of high threshold it's not that
42:49 - user friendly for a beginner or someone
42:51 - who doesn't have a lot of experience
42:52 - working with these but but you know hack
42:54 - away at it and hopefully these that
42:56 - video will help
43:00 - um uh is there documentation for the
43:02 - different commands you can make the
43:03 - Twitter bot do uh yes so what I what I
43:06 - would suggest in this case is um if you
43:09 - go to uh my uh YouTube
43:12 - channel um and go back to um this
43:17 - particular playlist Twitter about
43:19 - tutorial no. and processing I go through
43:21 - all of the twitterbot stuff in a series
43:23 - of like five or six videos of how you
43:25 - can be unate with the API and how you
43:27 - set up your keys and all that stuff so
43:29 - that video that I made about Heroku is
43:30 - going to get tacked on the end of that
43:32 - playlist as just deploying your
43:34 - Bot uh okay
43:37 - um and now I will attempt to do the next
43:44 - demonstration I'm going to check the
43:45 - battery on the oh on my
43:50 - um I still have a full bar there so I
43:53 - think I'm good battery wise and I have
43:55 - three bars here so I think I'm pretty
43:59 - good battery wise for
44:00 - audio um incidentally I'm not trying to
44:04 - the one thing I'm doing today is making
44:06 - uh videos that you that don't use the
44:08 - Whiteboard um oh whoops I don't have the
44:12 - um because I I have a new whiteboard
44:14 - coming by FedEx today I'm going try to
44:17 - mount it to the wall over there I
44:18 - realize now that I probably need
44:20 - unfortunately I have four LED lights
44:23 - which is lighting this area really well
44:25 - I thought I would just use two here and
44:26 - two there I might need to get four more
44:29 - um um but that that should be so as soon
44:32 - as I get the Whiteboard up I'm very the
44:35 - I'm going to uh be able to do a lot more
44:36 - tutorials that involve kind of different
44:38 - math-based algorithms and also the set
44:41 - of get tutorials I want to do which um
44:43 - even though I I kind of want to use the
44:45 - Whiteboard to kind of diagram out how
44:47 - git Works um okay
44:53 - uh um okay so let's let me get to uh
44:58 - here and Let me refresh this uh Ah
45:00 - that's good the camera went
45:05 - off and I am going
45:09 - to uh come back over
45:14 - here
45:17 - uh
45:19 - uh uh Chris Coleman writes on Twitter by
45:23 - the way we need a diagram and walk of
45:26 - your setup Studio setup sometime so I
45:28 - did that the other day on Periscope and
45:30 - maybe I'll do that again today I I I
45:31 - kind of but I didn't like it wasn't my
45:33 - intention to do that so I will um I
45:36 - definitely will do that I have a a video
45:38 - about it that I made a while ago but
45:40 - it's it's a different set up now so yeah
45:42 - I will do that um okay
45:49 - uh uh here we go now um let me just have
45:54 - a little sip of this
45:58 - okay so um I'm going to go back to I'm
46:01 - going to close this we don't need Heroku
46:03 - open anymore we need this
46:06 - open
46:07 - um and uh ah so actually so here's the
46:15 - thing I want to show how in this video
46:18 - not just to run a plain vanilla
46:22 - twitterbot but a twitterbot that also
46:25 - posts
46:26 - images so let me see if I think that's
46:30 - this
46:32 - one so this is the
46:34 - one that
46:38 - runs um that does the
46:41 - image let me see what happens here so
46:44 - hold on a
46:47 - second uh let me get this
46:51 - set
46:54 - um
46:56 - sorry
46:58 - uh I want to go to the node five
47:03 - example uh and say node bot.
47:06 - js let's see if this
47:11 - works claims it
47:13 - worked let's see what's here okay great
47:17 - so that did work so um so I'm going to
47:21 - uh did I yeah so this particular bot
47:25 - what it's do doing and again the
47:28 - tutorial
47:30 - is
47:32 - um uh the tutorial I'm sorry I've lost
47:35 - my train of thought here for a
47:37 - second the it I I already made tutorials
47:40 - that show how to have the twitterbot
47:42 - create an image and post that image so
47:45 - what I'm going to do now is just show
47:48 - how
47:49 - to um send the image uh how to do that
47:54 - on Amazon Okay so I got to look through
47:56 - these notes for a second just to
47:58 - see
48:00 - um that's installing Java doing this
48:04 - command
48:06 - uh oh right right right right right
48:09 - right right right right right right
48:10 - right right okay uh all right so I'm
48:12 - going to follow these
48:14 - instructions in this video I probably
48:17 - should practice
48:18 - this but I'm not going to
48:22 - um and so here we go so
48:26 - so actually what I want to do also
48:30 - is I just need to have this here uh I
48:36 - need to have this
48:37 - here and what I'm going to do is open
48:43 - up uh processing let me just see if I
48:46 - need to update my processing oh I
48:49 - do
48:51 - uh okay yes so by the way uh
48:56 - um uh there is 3.0.2 which I'm going to
48:59 - get right now uh so I'm using the most
49:02 - recent processing in this particular
49:04 - video uh we'll be getting to the ec2
49:07 - thing in a second hey I've got I'm
49:08 - gating audience members I got to get do
49:11 - something more interesting I did do a
49:13 - little dance earlier that was kind of
49:15 - pathetic
49:16 - but uh so I
49:20 - am just I just want to have the most
49:23 - recent version of processing and I'm
49:25 - going to have this sketch
49:27 - open oh it's in use let's close
49:30 - processing let's replace it on the
49:35 - desktop okay so here I have the notes I
49:37 - have Twitter open I'm also going to need
49:40 - cyberduck at some point but I will get
49:42 - to that later I have this and let we
49:44 - open up
49:47 - processing open it
49:50 - and just getting all the pieces together
49:54 - can close
49:56 - close this
49:58 - one uh processing is now open I guess I
50:01 - don't need to show the welcome message
50:03 - every time and what I want to do
50:07 - is uh look at
50:14 - this
50:17 - and
50:20 - uh okay oh I forgot that it has exit in
50:24 - there
50:26 - okay great so this is the processing
50:29 - sketch it creates an image the bot
50:32 - triggers the processing sketch draws the
50:35 - image posts it to
50:37 - Twitter
50:38 - and that's that okay so I'm going to
50:42 - show you how now to run this locally and
50:45 - then deploy to
50:46 - ec2 okay and I'm going to have my notes
50:48 - open over here as
50:51 - well
50:53 - um in case I need need to look at that
50:57 - ec2 it's a little bit big uh
51:01 - okay
51:04 - and uh
51:06 - here we
51:08 - go so I
51:11 - have the processing sketch the
51:15 - twitterbot
51:17 - code
51:18 - [Music]
51:20 - and uh the twitterbot open getting all
51:24 - these notifications what are they oh
51:27 - people are liking my tweets and saying
51:29 - hi to me that's
51:32 - nice okay uh but I just want to
51:35 - be in my egg I'm an egg okay uh purple
51:40 - yay more purple okay sorry I'm I'm I'm
51:43 - I'm like scared of making this
51:44 - particular tutorial but I'm just gonna
51:46 - do it all
51:49 - right here we
51:52 - go um I'm going to hit let me just check
51:57 - the chat to make sure there's nobody
51:58 - saying
52:00 - anything
52:01 - uh I lost a
52:05 - viewer okay here we go I have my notes
52:09 - Here There we
52:14 - go
52:17 - okay hello in this video I'm going to
52:20 - look at how you can deploy a Twitter bot
52:23 - written in node.js to an amaz Amazon ec2
52:26 - instance in particular one of the
52:28 - reasons I want to use an Amazon ec2
52:30 - instance in this case is because not
52:32 - only is my twitterbot written in node.js
52:35 - but my twitterbot triggers a processing
52:37 - sketch which is a Java program to create
52:40 - an image and that image is posted to
52:42 - Twitter so if you want to uh make a
52:46 - image producing twitterbot this is one
52:48 - solution for you this is not the be all
52:50 - endall solution of course there's lots
52:52 - of ways to write Twitter Bots and
52:53 - there's lots of ways to make images but
52:55 - you can see here so I'm in a moment I'm
52:57 - going to start going through those steps
52:59 - but let's just kind of get a lay of the
53:01 - land here for a second so here you can
53:03 - see this is a particular twitterbot it
53:05 - posts an image made from processing you
53:07 - can see the image here this is the
53:09 - processing sketch if I run the
53:11 - processing sketch here you can see it
53:13 - just draws this particular image uh it
53:15 - also saves it to a file and exits um
53:18 - because here now is the code you can see
53:21 - the code in node is triggering that
53:24 - processing sketch here uh and now if I
53:29 - run that
53:31 - code the image bot is starting it says
53:34 - it worked and if I go back to
53:38 - Twitter we can see here I got another
53:40 - one now these two images are different
53:42 - even though they look remarkably the
53:44 - same remarkably similar um but um they
53:47 - are they are different right someone
53:50 - doing a quick pixel analysis they're
53:52 - different they have to be different
53:53 - otherwise my whole understanding of the
53:54 - way the universe work works is faulty
53:56 - okay so now we see this is how we you
53:59 - run this stuff locally this is what I
54:00 - did in all the previous uh videos in
54:02 - this playlist about node Twitter bot
54:05 - things now we need to look at how do we
54:07 - uh how do we uh deploy this stuff to an
54:10 - Amazon ec2 instance you know basically
54:14 - you know any other any Linux uh uh Linux
54:16 - server um you could follow these same
54:18 - steps and I'm just going to happen to
54:20 - use Amazon and I was able to do this
54:22 - with a free account now at some point
54:25 - you might discover you have to pay but
54:27 - for the most part it seems like you can
54:28 - run this using uh free credits at least
54:30 - for quite a long time okay so I do
54:32 - happen to have these notes online on a
54:34 - web page which will be linked to in the
54:36 - description of this video which
54:38 - presumably you are watching at some
54:39 - other time than the actual moment that
54:41 - I'm speaking right now um but the first
54:43 - thing I'm going to do here is go to this
54:45 - link Amazon ec2 but actually I can just
54:47 - type in Amazon ec2 probably into Google
54:50 - and uh I'm going to even just uh go down
54:53 - here and click on the first result
54:55 - result and what I want to do is sign
54:57 - into the console the console is where
54:59 - I'm going to get to configure my server
55:02 - so that's the first thing I want to do
55:03 - sign into the
55:05 - console and then I have to enter in my
55:11 - password uh and I don't want Chrome to
55:14 - save it okay ah I'm presented with this
55:17 - terrifying page of like 50 zillion
55:19 - things we could do I there's so much
55:21 - here I have no idea what any of it does
55:23 - but up here in the top left
55:25 - ec2 virtual servers in the cloud
55:28 - floating in the air um so uh those
55:31 - servers which are more likely in an
55:33 - underground bunker somewhere not in a
55:34 - cloud but uh this is what I want I want
55:37 - to run a server somewhere else or I can
55:39 - run this particular bot so I'm going to
55:41 - click on
55:43 - ec2 and I get an ec2 Management console
55:47 - and oh good oh no I do I have I
55:50 - currently have one running instance
55:53 - which is I guess probably some previous
55:54 - test that I did at another time but I'm
55:56 - going to just click launch
55:59 - instance uh and now I'm presented also
56:01 - with a terrifying set of objects of op
56:03 - of objects of options so I'm going to go
56:06 - back to my notes page where I said this
56:08 - is the one that I happen to use so
56:10 - there's different versions of Linux
56:12 - operating systems and different kinds of
56:14 - and uh um the the the key things that
56:17 - I'm looking for one is free tier
56:19 - eligible I'm to see if I can get this
56:20 - running on the free tier the other is I
56:23 - need one that can also not just run but
56:25 - run Java and so happens that this ubut
56:27 - server
56:28 - 14.04 it happens to also be able to run
56:31 - uh Java I also want to make sure I pick
56:33 - general purpose free tier micro and then
56:36 - set review and launch so I'm going to do
56:38 - that I'm going to look for that one
56:40 - which is this one I'm going to hit
56:42 - select over here I don't know if you
56:44 - guys can see this I should make the but
56:45 - Ubuntu Server 1404 I'm going to hit
56:48 - select uh a general purpose T2 free tier
56:53 - eligible I'm going to hit review and
56:57 - launch and now it is
57:00 - launched um great oh no launch now I'm
57:04 - gonna hit
57:05 - launch and ah okay so
57:09 - ah so here's so if okay so here's the
57:12 - deal this is the weirdest part of
57:14 - working with Amazon ec2 is how you're
57:16 - going to now authenticate and log into
57:18 - it and you need to create this secret
57:21 - file that holds the keys to your server
57:23 - now apparently I've been here before and
57:26 - I've made a bunch of these because I was
57:28 - showing different uh examples so you
57:31 - likely won't have any previous Keys you
57:33 - can use so but I I'm going to create a
57:36 - new key pair so I need to give it a name
57:38 - and I'm going to call it coding rainbow
57:41 - if you can see that and I'm going to
57:42 - then click download key pair oh yikes ah
57:47 - what
57:48 - happened I'm zooming like a I've
57:51 - completely lost my ability to zoom
57:54 - effectively so I'm going to hit download
57:56 - key
57:57 - pair and we should see hopefully uh that
58:01 - ah you can see here uh oh I'm standing
58:04 - in front of it but down here under my
58:06 - downloads uh in the downloads there is
58:09 - now this file coding rainbow. pem you
58:13 - must have this file I now need that file
58:16 - always and forever to log into uh this
58:19 - ec2 instance in a variety of different
58:22 - ways that I'll show you okay so I have
58:24 - that file now and uh now I should be
58:27 - able to now finally say launch instances
58:30 - now that I have that file I can say
58:32 - launch instances and waiting your
58:35 - instances are now
58:37 - launching and now I can go to view
58:41 - instances and uh I don't I'm not
58:44 - worrying about that right now so you can
58:45 - see this is clearly one that I made a
58:48 - while ago uh when I was doing another
58:50 - tutorial or another test or um and you
58:53 - can see this one hasn't actually
58:54 - completely launched yet um so this is
58:57 - the problem of making these videos in
58:59 - real time where I I I I sometimes uh I
59:04 - just stand here like completely
59:05 - awkwardly like dumbfounded I don't know
59:06 - what to do it's pending let's go to the
59:08 - next steps and when we come back
59:09 - hopefully it'll be um hopefully it'll be
59:11 - working so okay so uh I I followed these
59:15 - steps I did this part now aha okay so
59:18 - what I need to do now is use that key
59:22 - that file to be able to log into that
59:25 - instance so the way that the first thing
59:27 - I need to do is actually change the
59:29 - files
59:30 - permissions so files on computers have
59:33 - permissions some files are like locked
59:35 - and you can't edit them some files are
59:37 - applications that can be executable this
59:39 - particular key file needs uh CH stands
59:42 - for like change modif actually what does
59:44 - it stand for somebody tell me somebody
59:46 - write I'll do an annotation here it say
59:48 - but I I need to run this command to
59:50 - change its file permissions so what I'm
59:53 - going to do
59:55 - is uh the first thing I need to do is I
59:58 - need to go to where that file is so
60:00 - actually I'm just going to put that file
60:02 - on the
60:03 - desktop you can come up with a better
60:05 - place to put it uh and I'm going to go
60:09 - to the desktop and I can see there is
60:12 - that
60:12 - file and uh I guess I'm zoomed in or
60:16 - something uh so now what I want to do is
60:20 - oops type in this particular command
60:24 - chod 400 and then that file name which
60:28 - is was coding rainbow. PM so that's a
60:32 - first thing I've done I've now changed
60:33 - the file permissions to 400 for that
60:36 - particular file and then now I can you
60:40 - do something called
60:42 - SSH ssh secure shell um so basically
60:48 - what I want to do is in the same way
60:50 - that I have my I'm here in terminal on
60:53 - my computer and I can look at the files
60:55 - by saying LS I can run the files by
60:57 - saying like node what I want to do is be
61:00 - able to remote into that Amazon ec2
61:04 - instance so that the terminal I'm
61:06 - looking at the commands I'm typing are
61:08 - actually not running on my laptop which
61:10 - is here that was dangerous to pick it up
61:13 - not running on this laptop but actually
61:14 - the commands are executing on the server
61:16 - floating in the cloud that's buried in
61:18 - the underground bunker okay so uh let's
61:21 - see here if ah so me rambling for a long
61:26 - period of time we're at 9 minutes here
61:28 - has actually caused this this instance
61:30 - to be running I don't know why it
61:31 - doesn't have a name here let me give it
61:33 - a
61:34 - name so um and one thing I can do here
61:38 - uh if I zoom in and rightclick see this
61:40 - connect option this is going to be
61:42 - really useful to me because actually it
61:45 - gives me all of right this is the
61:47 - command it's got I've got the command
61:49 - right here uh this is like the public
61:52 - this is like the I the address
61:54 - essentially of that instance and then
61:58 - here it's actually giving me the exact
62:00 - command to log into it so I don't even
62:03 - need to figure out what it is uh I can
62:06 - just copy this and go back to terminal
62:09 - and paste that in here hit enter and
62:13 - okay this is the first time that I'm
62:15 - connecting so my computer is saying I
62:18 - don't know about this I haven't
62:19 - connected this place before is anything
62:21 - is there anything that I should be
62:22 - afraid of here it's nothing so I should
62:24 - hit type yes and now it's added and then
62:28 - I just sit here and I hope I wait and I
62:31 - hope that the internet will oblige me
62:33 - and connect ah there we go so look at
62:36 - that you can now see here that I am
62:39 - connected I have logged in under my new
62:41 - name Ubuntu to my new address IP 17231
62:46 - 34179 so now I can do things like say uh
62:51 - PWD with print working directory here I
62:53 - am in home Ubuntu I can type LS and I
62:56 - can see there's nothing there so now
63:00 - this is great right this bot which I
63:04 - have here locally on my computer I want
63:06 - to be able to get it over here on my
63:09 - Amazon ec2 instance so how do I upload
63:11 - files there so the way one way to upload
63:14 - files to your Amazon ec2 instance is
63:17 - with uh uh FTP or file transfer protocol
63:21 - secure FTP so the way that I could do
63:24 - that is you could use any any FTP
63:27 - software and all sorts of there's
63:29 - probably a way to do it through the web
63:31 - through a browser but I'm going to use
63:32 - something called cyberduck uh which you
63:34 - can Google and download I already have
63:36 - it installed here and so I'm going to
63:38 - run cyberduck apparently I and what I'm
63:41 - going to do here I have a cyberduck open
63:44 - what I want to hit is this open
63:46 - connection so I click open connection
63:49 - and now I have this window where what I
63:53 - need to do is is put in all the
63:55 - information for that Amazon ec2 instance
63:58 - so first thing I want to do is make sure
64:00 - I do SFTP it's got to be secure shell
64:03 - fiot transfer protocol and then the
64:06 - server address if I go back to here
64:10 - should be this right this is connect to
64:13 - your instance using the public DNS it's
64:16 - this so I'm going to copy this and go
64:19 - back to
64:20 - cyberduck paste that in here now there's
64:24 - this interesting question here which is
64:26 - what's my username and password well I
64:28 - don't have a username and password I
64:30 - have this weird coding rainbow. pem
64:33 - private key file it turns out in
64:35 - cyberduck under here under more options
64:38 - I can click that and I can say
64:41 - use public key
64:44 - authentication so I click that and now I
64:46 - go to the desktop and I select this
64:50 - file and
64:52 - now I um
64:54 - I've now have this file selected as my
64:57 - way of authenticating and I should be
64:59 - able to just say
65:01 - connect oh maybe I need to write Ubuntu
65:04 - here just in the uh
65:09 - username and uh ah it works okay so that
65:13 - was one little step that I had
65:14 - personally forgotten that I need to put
65:16 - in the username I need to say Ubuntu but
65:18 - now I just have this window here right
65:20 - this is now a view into home/ Ubuntu so
65:23 - what do I want to do I want to go and I
65:26 - want to just go here this is this folder
65:29 - here node five is where I have all of my
65:33 - stuff and I'm actually just I'm just
65:35 - going to take um bot config and
65:38 - package.json I'm just going to upload
65:40 - those files right now so I can drag them
65:43 - in here drag those files into here and
65:46 - they're now uploading a little window is
65:47 - telling me progress they're transferring
65:49 - I can see that those files are listed
65:51 - here right now and now I can go back
65:54 - here and I can say LS and you can see
65:57 - those files are there yay these things
66:01 - are working so now running out of breath
66:04 - here um now I can type in node and you
66:09 - no this is going to not work because I
66:11 - i' I've missed a set of steps here but
66:13 - node bot.
66:15 - js and so what's happening here the
66:19 - program node can be found in the
66:21 - following packages node nodejs Legacy so
66:25 - and then it's saying pseudo app get
66:27 - install selected package so one thing we
66:29 - first have to do is at least configure
66:31 - node to work that the way that we want
66:33 - it to work and I believe that I have
66:35 - mentioned that here uh and these are
66:39 - some steps that you can do so let's
66:42 - actually just run through these steps
66:43 - the first thing I want to do is call uh
66:47 - do pseudo apt get update so what that
66:50 - does is just says this apt get thing
66:52 - which is a tool to like get things like
66:54 - node and other software I want to make
66:56 - sure it's updated and has all of the
66:58 - most recent stuff so that's done then
67:00 - the next thing I want to do is install
67:04 - nodejs which say pseudo app get install
67:08 - nodejs so I'm going to run that uh my
67:11 - audio is still working ah this is asking
67:13 - me if I want to use the disk space which
67:15 - of course I do um so I'm going to run
67:17 - and install
67:18 - nodejs which is great then I also want
67:21 - to make sure I have npm installed which
67:23 - is node package manager which you might
67:25 - remember from the previous node
67:27 - tutorials uh and this needs 130
67:30 - megabytes of disc space so hopefully
67:31 - this doesn't take too long um so um this
67:34 - is installing now the next step while
67:36 - it's installing let's talk about the
67:38 - next step for a second
67:41 - um this is now a a command to make sure
67:47 - that the particular version of node that
67:50 - I installed is now the actual version of
67:53 - node that will run when I type in the
67:55 - node command um so I am going to grab
68:00 - this command here and hope that this is
68:03 - done it's done and I'm going to because
68:06 - watch what happens if I just type node
68:08 - right now it doesn't actually know what
68:10 - node it can be found in the it's like
68:12 - well which one should I run nodejs
68:14 - Legacy or this one node so I want to
68:16 - make sure that I run this particular one
68:20 - with that command and now when I type
68:22 - node you'll see I'm in node so now I
68:24 - have node running on my Amazon ec2
68:27 - instance and I can oh wait if I say
68:29 - clear here oh it does still work I can
68:31 - say uh node bot. js now first error I
68:36 - get is it cannot find module twit this
68:39 - is going to be notice when I uploaded my
68:41 - files remember how I said I uploaded the
68:44 - files I didn't upload the directory that
68:46 - said node modules I could have uploaded
68:48 - that directory but it makes more sense
68:51 - for me to just let those modules get
68:53 - installed by Amazon itself so I can just
68:56 - type in npm
68:58 - install and it's now going to install
69:00 - all the modules that are needed for this
69:02 - particular bot we went through this
69:04 - locally now I'm doing this on the server
69:07 - so if if we looked here and I said I
69:09 - refreshed you can see that now there is
69:11 - a directory called node modules which
69:13 - has for example that twit module in it
69:16 - so now I should be able to say node bot.
69:19 - js and it will run now here's the thing
69:23 - it runs so these are all the steps you
69:26 - need if you just have a plain old bot
69:28 - that only runs in node but the reason
69:31 - why I got an error now is it can't find
69:34 - that image file
69:37 - output.png the reason why it can't find
69:39 - that image file output.png is because
69:42 - that's the image file that's created by
69:44 - the processing sketch so while this part
69:46 - of the video I've now concluded like you
69:48 - could if you just have a node.js bot
69:51 - you're kind of done although there's
69:52 - another step of getting it to run after
69:54 - you log out which I will get to Let's uh
69:58 - but let's get the let's get the image
70:00 - itself to let's get the image making
70:03 - processing sketch to run as well so
70:05 - let's look at how we do that and there's
70:07 - a lot of like sort of uh awfully scary
70:09 - looking weird commands to do that okay
70:12 - uh oh but
70:14 - um actually so um yeah I'll come back to
70:17 - the forever thing okay so the first
70:20 - thing we need to do is make sure Java is
70:23 - on our our uh server so first thing I
70:25 - want to do is install Java which I want
70:27 - to say apt get install default
70:30 - JRE uh so I'm going to put that in and
70:34 - run that and it's going to take 209
70:36 - megabytes of dis space I'm going to say
70:37 - yes so now I'm installing
70:40 - Java and I'm going to wait for that to
70:43 - install let's go back while we're doing
70:44 - that to the next step The Next Step okay
70:47 - so look at all these like terrifyingly
70:49 - weird looking commands so what's the
70:52 - weird thing that has to happen
70:55 - when you work when you work with
70:57 - processing on a computer your computer
70:59 - is typically connected to a monitor a
71:02 - screen and you're seeing the output of
71:04 - processing on that screen your Amazon
71:06 - ec2 instance has no screen it has no
71:09 - goey interface it's just a server that
71:11 - you can SSH into or FTP files to but
71:15 - it's known as headless meaning
71:17 - processing actually when it runs it
71:19 - breaks because it's like I don't know
71:21 - what Graphics thing to draw anything to
71:23 - there is no Graphics thing so these next
71:25 - steps are steps that create a fake
71:29 - display essentially the ec2 instance has
71:32 - this display you're tricking it into
71:34 - thinking that it is connected to a
71:36 - display because we don't need to see it
71:37 - we just want the graphics to be rendered
71:39 - to a file so the first thing I'm going
71:41 - to do is install something called xvfb
71:44 - which you could uh Google to find out
71:46 - what it
71:47 - is uh I'm going to run this particular
71:50 - command which will install this tool for
71:52 - a fake display
71:54 - the other thing I'm going to do
71:57 - is uh give it a now I'm going to give it
72:00 - an actual screen which is has a
72:02 - resolution of 1024 by 768 why
72:06 - not so I will do that it gives some
72:10 - weird little errors but you know big
72:12 - deal so this seems to be running a
72:15 - process that um uh I need to like now
72:19 - quit out of so I'm going to hit control
72:20 - C to do that uh and then then I'm ah
72:25 - okay so this was this was the command
72:28 - that creates that screen and that screen
72:30 - was there only while it's running um but
72:33 - I also now need to export it and and
72:35 - assign it to be display one so so
72:37 - actually these commands are no good so
72:40 - this is the command let me uh let me
72:42 - explain that again so I'm going to run
72:44 - this Command
72:45 - right and that screen now exists for
72:48 - processing to draw into but I can't type
72:50 - in any other commands here because it's
72:53 - it's like running so what I needed to do
72:55 - is I needed to run in the background and
72:57 - a command for having things run in the
72:59 - background is no
73:02 - hop so I'm actually going to say this
73:07 - now and now you can see I'm back to my
73:11 - terminal but that screen is now created
73:14 - and I also just want to assign it
73:16 - display number one that's what
73:17 - processing will draw to display number
73:19 - one so that's
73:21 - done so now we're in good shape now
73:24 - here's the thing if we go
73:28 - back to the code you'll notice here this
73:32 - is the code that I ran locally on my
73:35 - laptop for triggering processing to run
73:38 - processing Das Java but actually now
73:41 - that I'm on a Amazon server boy this is
73:44 - I'm 20 minutes is anybody still watching
73:46 - this 20 minutes into a tour about
73:48 - uploading stuff to Amazon ec2
73:51 - but I have now I'm now on an Amazon ec2
73:55 - instance which is a Linux machine so
73:57 - there's actually a different way that I
73:58 - can do this I can go to my processing
74:02 - sketch and I can go under file export
74:05 - application so export application is
74:08 - something you can always do and it opens
74:11 - up a little window and what I want to
74:12 - actually do is check
74:15 - Linux okay I want to export it as a
74:19 - Linux application now there is this
74:21 - embed Java option
74:23 - which I'm kind of confused whether I
74:25 - want to select did
74:28 - I I don't recall whether I need to
74:30 - select that or not let's try unselecting
74:34 - it uh I probably should keep it selected
74:37 - but let's try unselecting it and I'm
74:39 - going to hit
74:42 - export so you can see here now I have um
74:46 - the Linux application incidentally
74:49 - here's a version that you could run on a
74:50 - Raspberry Pi which we'll get to later
74:54 - so now um I should be able to go back
74:57 - and uh upload
75:00 - this um to okay so I I I'm G to have
75:04 - this application which I want to include
75:06 - so oh no ah boy this tutorial is not
75:08 - going very well that light went off
75:10 - camera went off I don't know why this
75:11 - light keeps coming off um so I'm going
75:15 - to now now what I need to do is I need
75:20 - to take this folder and and I'm going to
75:24 - upload that
75:26 - folder
75:28 - to
75:29 - oops my server so I'm G to upload that
75:33 - here so I'm uploading that Linux
75:38 - application it's there now I'm also
75:40 - going to rename this file this folder
75:43 - and call it
75:45 - rainbow uh and I want to I do want to do
75:48 - that um so you can see here the
75:51 - application is now here in this
75:53 - particular folder so the first thing we
75:56 - need to do is figure out does this even
75:58 - work so remember here I am now on my I'm
76:02 - now logged in to the server and you can
76:05 - see there is a directory called
76:07 - rainbow so I can go into that directory
76:10 - we can see what's there this is actually
76:11 - the application and the way in Linux the
76:14 - way that you execute something is with
76:17 - do
76:18 - SL rainbow and it's going to say
76:21 - permission denied so there's a few
76:23 - things that I need to do here I need to
76:24 - get this to run somehow so let's go back
76:27 - to the steps um so it looks like uh all
76:32 - I need to do uh uh is say pseudo right
76:36 - so pseudo is a way of saying like I am
76:39 - in charge Here I Am the super user here
76:43 - so let's try running the application now
76:47 - uh what did I do wrong command not found
76:54 - Pudo oh oh you know what weirdly
76:56 - interestingly enough it needs to be in
77:01 - quotes is that really
77:03 - true that doesn't make any
77:08 - sense uh no why did I put the quotes
77:11 - there okay I have to pause this
77:13 - video while I figure this out I don't
77:15 - know if anyone is still watching this in
77:17 - the chat this has turned into such a
77:20 - like ginormous topic I knew I didn't
77:23 - want to make this
77:24 - video
77:28 - uh uh I'm looking in the chat okay does
77:31 - anybody know what I'm missing here well
77:33 - one thing is maybe I just need
77:34 - to uh change the
77:43 - permissions oh that's all I needed to
77:48 - do and now you see the image file is
77:51 - there crap okay so let me
77:54 - [Music]
78:00 - remove that file it's not there anymore
78:04 - let me
78:07 - uh
78:13 - uh oh it's working
78:16 - I uh I don't know what's something to
78:19 - make
78:21 - it not
78:24 - work no it's still
78:28 - working uh whatever ah
78:32 - shoot yes thank you oh plus X I like
78:35 - that better okay thank you sack Fab for
78:38 - correcting me all right I'm I'm just GNA
78:40 - have to frustratingly um splice this
78:43 - video back
78:45 - together um
78:48 - okay and I'm going to hit record okay I
78:53 - did forget a crucial step which is that
78:55 - I have to fix the permissions on that
78:57 - file to make it executable and a way I
78:59 - can do that is by chod plus x uh the
79:03 - file's name is
79:07 - Rainbow I don't know why I said plus X
79:11 - when what did I do wrong there sack but
79:13 - I'll just go back to 777 which makes it
79:16 - executable uh so let me try this
79:21 - again uh okay
79:24 - so I did miss a step there which is that
79:26 - um the the the permissions of the file I
79:28 - have to set the permissions to be
79:29 - executable which I can do by saying chod
79:32 - 777 uh rainbow and now I should be able
79:36 - to say do SL rainbow and run it and it
79:41 - did something it finished and now let's
79:43 - type LS and we can see look at that
79:46 - there is a file in there now called
79:49 - output.png so if I go in here and hit
79:54 - refresh and we go grab this file and I
79:57 - download it to my
79:59 - desktop and I take a look at it you can
80:01 - see this is the image that was now
80:03 - generated on the server so now we have
80:07 - the um processing sketch as a exported
80:10 - Linux application running on the Amazon
80:13 - ec2
80:15 - instance boy this is I know this is like
80:18 - 20 some minutes into this long tutorial
80:20 - but we're so close now to actually
80:21 - making the thing run it's very exciting
80:24 - okay so now if I go back to here one
80:27 - thing you'll notice I'm going to go back
80:28 - to the code is remember this this was
80:32 - the command that I had for running on my
80:34 - Mac to execute a processing sketch using
80:37 - processing command line processing Das
80:39 - Java but now that it's a Linux
80:41 - application the only thing I need to do
80:44 - is actually just I change that command
80:46 - to
80:48 - this rainbow only that's not exactly
80:52 - right because it's in a different
80:53 - directory and so I'm going to go here
80:57 - and um I just need to make sure
81:00 - uh um I I have the folder so I think
81:05 - actually I can just do this
81:07 - rainbowrainbow
81:09 - and uh now I've changed the code and
81:12 - since I changed the code I also need to
81:16 - re-upload the
81:20 - code uh to the server so I'm overwriting
81:24 - it continue so now that new code is
81:26 - running on the
81:28 - server and I should be able to go back a
81:34 - directory so now what's here we have
81:38 - bot. Js which triggers the processing
81:41 - application which is in rainbow and
81:43 - communicates with the Twitter API and po
81:45 - post a tweet so let's see if this works
81:48 - image bot is
81:49 - starting it worked and now now if I go
81:54 - here and look at the bot we should see 7
81:59 - seconds ago this particular image now I
82:02 - want to make sure it's really
82:04 - overwriting and making a new image so
82:06 - the only way I can think to really do
82:08 - that is to um go into the processing
82:12 - sketch for a
82:14 - second and uh change this to
82:18 - like a green
82:21 - value so let's make
82:25 - um
82:28 - oops you can see now the color should be
82:31 - green and I'm going to uh export this
82:36 - export application as a Linux
82:38 - application go into here take
82:43 - this and I probably shouldn't be doing
82:46 - this right now I'm going to upload
82:48 - it so I'm replacing
82:51 - it
82:54 - here we go so now I uploaded the new
82:58 - application and I'm going to go into
83:01 - that directory I'm going to whoops
83:04 - change the permissions again you don't
83:06 - ever need to do this I just want to
83:07 - really make sure it's working which is
83:09 - risky because it might not be I'm GNA go
83:12 - back up a directory and I'm going to say
83:15 - node bot. js image bot is
83:19 - starting it says it worked but I'm not
83:22 - entirely sure it overwrote that file I
83:24 - have a bad feeling it didn't ah it did
83:27 - okay that's magical so it does work so
83:30 - um and I can run it
83:32 - again now this particular bot by the way
83:35 - you noticed it just quits it only does
83:37 - it
83:38 - once and you can see we got another one
83:40 - these are two even though the this the
83:41 - same color scheme they're different I I
83:43 - should just make a a processing sketch
83:45 - that makes a much more recognizable
83:47 - image but here's the thing um uh what
83:51 - you want probably is your Bot to be
83:53 - running continuously so the one thing is
83:55 - just to add set interval to the code um
83:58 - but the other thing that you need is to
84:00 - use a tool known as forever so this is
84:03 - the last piece that's on um that's on
84:07 - this particular uh walk through so in
84:09 - other words what you want is for the
84:11 - node app to run forever in the
84:13 - background even when you log out of
84:16 - Amazon uh your instance and forever we
84:19 - saw that this no Huff thing is a way of
84:21 - doing it which is also a way but node
84:24 - has its own way of doing that which is
84:25 - something called forever so um I can say
84:28 - pseudo npm install forever- G so this is
84:32 - a node module that's not associated with
84:34 - a particular node application but a sort
84:36 - of global thing that you would run
84:38 - across a lot of applications so if I
84:41 - copy that here that's going to install
84:45 - this tool called
84:47 - Forever and then
84:51 - um
84:54 - it's gonna I'm do my in Forever install
84:57 - dance uh and then uh and then I can now
85:01 - um start and stop things I can say
85:04 - forever start bot.
85:07 - JS which is running it uh and you know
85:10 - you can set all sorts of parameters like
85:13 - you know how long should it be up for
85:14 - how long should it sleep and all that
85:16 - thing but I'm just letting it use the
85:17 - default and another thing I can type now
85:19 - is
85:21 - forever list I think and you can see
85:26 - um let's let's hold on let's make this a
85:28 - little bit more easy for you to see uh
85:32 - forever. list and you can see that uh
85:36 - this is the particular process that's
85:38 - running no. JS bot JS so if I wanted
85:41 - that one's just running now forever it's
85:43 - not tweeting forever because the process
85:46 - is not set to do that but I could um I
85:48 - can do things like say forever stop all
85:51 - I believe which just stopped everything
85:54 - so now if I say forever list again
85:57 - there's no forever processes running and
85:59 - I can say uh forever uh start again um
86:03 - so there's lots of different ways so so
86:05 - this is what you want to do you want to
86:07 - and so if I set that running and I log
86:10 - out my bot is now going to be running
86:12 - Forever on that Amazon ec2
86:14 - instance this is like probably one of
86:16 - the longest tutorial videos I've ever
86:18 - made it was completely sort of like
86:19 - frantic and a little haphazard this is
86:21 - probably hard to follow probably to be
86:23 - honest with you this page of
86:25 - instructions might actually make it
86:27 - easier but let me just review to recap
86:30 - what I covered at this particular very
86:32 - long tutorial which is that first thing
86:34 - you want to do is create that server
86:37 - instance right you need to get a key
86:40 - pair a file so that you can log into it
86:44 - once you've logged into it you want to
86:46 - SSH into it you can connect to it from
86:48 - terminal then you want to do things like
86:50 - install node then you want to connect to
86:53 - it with FTP SFTP cyberduck being a tool
86:57 - for doing that that allows you to upload
86:59 - your files there once you've uploaded
87:01 - your files there you can run your Bot
87:04 - but if your Bot also runs a processing
87:06 - sketch you want to also install Java run
87:10 - these commands to create the fake
87:11 - display in the background then export
87:14 - your processing sketch as a Linux
87:16 - application and upload that once you
87:18 - have all of that there then you can use
87:21 - forever to run your node bot that
87:23 - triggers the processing
87:25 - sketch this is like the um the kick the
87:28 - cat that my father bought for tuu Z but
87:32 - anyway that that that that runs the node
87:35 - that runs the processing sketch that
87:37 - creates the fake display that runs with
87:39 - forever my father bought for anyway
87:41 - whatever um so uh all those steps and
87:44 - you've got your thing running so I've
87:46 - anybody actually watched this entire
87:48 - video and actually has a node bot
87:50 - running on an Amazon EC do instance
87:53 - successfully I don't know please send me
87:55 - a tweet or something or to let me know
87:57 - because um uh uh because that would make
88:01 - me happy um to hear that okay so I'm
88:03 - going to stop recording now uh I will in
88:06 - the description for this video link to
88:08 - the written instructions link to all the
88:10 - references you need and hopefully this
88:13 - will be something that's useful to
88:14 - somebody someday somewhere in the
88:17 - universe and record okay um I have lost
88:22 - 50% of the viewers which is no surprise
88:26 - this was kind of one of my like uh not
88:28 - so
88:29 - interesting um oh I missed the space for
88:32 - the plus X thank you um this is uh one
88:35 - of my um um you know the tutorials that
88:38 - I just sort of said I would do and been
88:39 - meeting to get to um but to be honest it
88:43 - is not not I mean it's just like not one
88:45 - of the more interesting are are uh ones
88:49 - but it it is what it is
88:51 - um okay what time is it it
88:53 - is um 12:50 I think so I said I was
88:57 - going to um does anybody have any
88:58 - questions about the raspberry pie I
89:00 - think I'm going to come back to the
89:01 - Raspberry Pi this afternoon I'm going to
89:02 - take a break for lunch I'm just doing
89:05 - this all day by the way if you were
89:06 - wondering and I'm going to come back I
89:08 - know some of you might be late at night
89:09 - wherever you are in the world or maybe
89:11 - now you're just waking up um but I'm I'm
89:13 - I I'll Stick Around for another minute
89:14 - or two um five or 10 minutes even uh if
89:18 - people have a few questions they want to
89:19 - ask about any of that was there stuff uh
89:22 - also just you know I'm happy to just
89:23 - hear any feedback now is that is this
89:25 - kind of this not the kind of tutorial I
89:27 - usually do because it like involved so
89:30 - many moving parts and all these weird
89:31 - commands and I'm copying pasting and I
89:33 - don't understand half of what any of it
89:34 - means um but
89:38 - uh uh I see there are some things uh in
89:41 - the chat from before uh um but if people
89:46 - are just making comments but if anybody
89:48 - has any questions they want to ask let
89:50 - me know I'm planning to come back this
89:51 - afterno afternoon I'm going to see if
89:52 - the Whiteboard
89:53 - arrived so I can install it um because
89:57 - then maybe I could do some tutorials
89:58 - with the Whiteboard which would be
90:03 - exciting how is the white balance
90:05 - looking do I look like a a human being
90:07 - or like do I have like a weird orange
90:11 - color um okay I think an hour and a half
90:15 - um I feel pleased that I was able to get
90:17 - these two things off my list I'm just
90:20 - going to go look at the list by by the
90:22 - way uh while I'm here I'm waiting to see
90:24 - if anybody has any
90:25 - questions
90:29 - um uh so here deploying to ec2 this is
90:33 - basically what I did I did Heroku and
90:36 - ec2 I wanted to do a run it on Raspberry
90:38 - Pi tutorial which I might try to do this
90:41 - afternoon um and then there were some
90:43 - other other aspects to the twitterbot
90:46 - stuff that I think would be good to
90:48 - include as well um which I will get to
90:55 - um great uh thank you Dale um nice to
90:59 - hear that
91:00 - feedback um okay um white balance it
91:04 - looks okay thanks Sam okay so um can you
91:09 - tell how to host a website locally in a
91:12 - network okay that's a good question
91:14 - actually so I could do that right here
91:16 - right now which is that
91:19 - um uh if I
91:22 - um so uh okay so let me go back so if I
91:26 - had a
91:29 - um so if I had a node program that was a
91:33 - web server I could just run that node
91:36 - program right here and then this laptop
91:39 - this thing that I'm using right here you
91:40 - can see there's a laptop here uh sfpc
91:42 - that's where I am um this laptop will
91:45 - become a web server and I actually have
91:47 - another laptop over here that I could
91:49 - then connect to and see the web server
91:51 - and I I'll show you kind of um a little
91:53 - version of that real quick so I'm not
91:55 - going to write a node
91:57 - server I don't have that at the ready
92:00 - but actually
92:01 - Macs uh come with python pre-installed
92:04 - and python allows you to run a web
92:06 - server so if I were to just go here um
92:09 - I'm going to go to any one of these um
92:13 - uh folders I'm going to just go into
92:15 - this folder here and a CD into this
92:17 - directory so let's say in this directory
92:20 - these are all my files from my website
92:22 - they HTML files CSS files all that stuff
92:25 - and if what I and and now I want to run
92:27 - whatever my thing is that's a web server
92:30 - so you oh whoops okay I need to let you
92:33 - guys be able to see this um so I want to
92:36 - run so here is one way of running a web
92:39 - server on a Mac but you know node
92:41 - programmer can run a web server any you
92:43 - can program your own web server in any
92:44 - number of languages you can download
92:46 - things that run web servers but I'm
92:47 - running a web server so you can see the
92:50 - web Ser web server is running running on
92:52 - 0.0.0 meaning this computer Local Host
92:54 - on Port 8000 so if I go to my browser
92:58 - and I type in Local Host Port 8000
93:02 - that's the URL for this particular web
93:05 - server I can see it here and I can go
93:07 - into here and I can click here and I can
93:09 - see like this is a page that's running
93:10 - one of my p5js examples so now the
93:14 - question
93:15 - becomes that's running on this
93:17 - particular laptop what if I want this
93:19 - laptop to access this both of these
93:21 - laptops are on the same local network so
93:23 - first thing I need to know
93:25 - is um not about this Mac if I go to
93:29 - system
93:30 - preferences um under
93:34 - network uh and under uh Advanced here
93:37 - actually you know what it's right
93:39 - here Wi-Fi is connected and has this
93:42 - particular IP address this is actually
93:43 - going to become quite important when I
93:44 - look at some Raspberry Pi uh tutorials
93:47 - because I'm going to connect to the
93:47 - Raspberry Pi in a similar way so what I
93:50 - need to do now is on this lab laptop I
93:52 - need to typee in that that IP address
93:55 - into the into the um browser so I'm
93:58 - going to do that
94:05 - 192.168.1.1 191 but that's not enough
94:08 - because I'm running the server on Port
94:11 - 8000 so colon
94:14 - 8000 and you can see here I don't know
94:16 - if you can see you probably can't see
94:18 - this but if I go under forces under one
94:21 - of the examples I don't know if you can
94:23 - see this but this is that web page
94:24 - running I've messed with the key by like
94:27 - Shining Light at the camera um but so
94:29 - now I have this laptop connecting it so
94:31 - there's a web server here and the other
94:33 - computers are connecting to it like it's
94:35 - a web server hopefully that answered
94:37 - that
94:39 - question that's kind of its own little
94:41 - tutorial itself I should have hit record
94:43 - um okay I am now going to uh pause for a
94:47 - second and look at some things on my
94:50 - computer while I wait to see if there's
94:51 - any other
94:52 - questions I made 16 oh boy I think that
94:58 - twitterbot might still be running on
95:00 - Amazon ec2 or did I just do it so many
95:02 - times nine minutes
95:05 - ago that's weird I wonder what that
95:08 - twitterbot is doing I should make sure
95:10 - it's
95:11 - stopped uh oh okay it is stopped maybe
95:15 - it did
95:16 - have oh yeah I just didn't have the set
95:19 - interval I haven't commented out that
95:20 - was silly me I should have put that back
95:22 - in it's in the code there um notice that
95:25 - okay
95:28 - um all right so I'm gonna take a lunch
95:33 - break Tuesdays and Fridays are currently
95:36 - my days Friday I have actually some
95:37 - other stuff planned this week so I'm
95:39 - going to see if I can do some more
95:40 - recording on Thursday maybe this week if
95:42 - I have time but I uh as for those of you
95:45 - who might not be aware I'm kind of
95:47 - trying to spend more time uh this
95:49 - semester while I have a break from
95:52 - teaching my usual load of classes to
95:53 - make many video
95:55 - tutorials um and I have a list of things
95:57 - I'm kind of tracking here uh Chrome
95:59 - extension tutorials get tutorials more
96:03 - other things um so uh send me feedback
96:05 - Twitter at shiffman is the best way to
96:07 - reach me um I I'm not really uh uh and
96:11 - also if programming questions it's great
96:13 - if you use forum. processing.org for
96:15 - processing in p5js questions um and I'm
96:19 - going to try it's 1:00 I'm going to try
96:22 - in about an hour or an hour and a half
96:24 - to do some more recording for lat this
96:26 - afternoon around 2:30 so somewhere
96:28 - around 2 or 3 Eastern Standard Time um
96:31 - so send me feedback send me your weird
96:34 - gifts that you make of these videos if
96:36 - anybody wants to do that um and um
96:40 - that's
96:41 - uh that's it for for right now I will be
96:44 - back this afternoon okay um see you all
96:47 - I'm G click I click a button over here
96:49 - and then I go away I think
