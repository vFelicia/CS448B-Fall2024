00:01 - Hello welcome to a first video of a new playlist called programming from A to Z.
00:06 - and this playlist is going to
be. It will be as I make it!  A lot
00:11 - of videos that are going to
follow this
00:15 - course that I'm teaching
at a program called ITP
00:19 - at School of the Arts New York University called programming from A to Z.
00:23 - And in this video.
00:25 - If you're really just interested in the
technical content you can just skip ahead
00:27 - and stop watching this video. But
in this video I want to just kind of talk
00:31 - about where the ideas for this course
came from some, of my inspiration for
00:35 - putting the material together for this
course and what my goals for it are.
00:39 - So what and kind of like who.......
00:40 - What do you need to have in advance before you start watching this sequence and
00:44 - I will mention that a lot of
the videos that I make I intend for
00:48 - them to be kind of stand alone videos
that could be  placed.
00:52 - That you could kind of come
to on them their own, but
00:54 - I'm going to seek with them in a way that will give you a little bit of a narrative
00:57 - over the course of this fall.
00:58 - It is September something in
2016.
01:03 - That's when this video is being recorded.
01:04 - But maybe you are an alien robot
of the future watching it and
01:08 - wondering about this strange
earth a species on the Internet.
01:12 - If the internet still exists anyway.
01:14 - OK So OK so
01:16 - let me talk a little bit about where
this the idea for this course came from.
01:19 - So I think this was probably
at least ten years ago.
01:21 - If not more.
01:22 - I was at the University of Pennsylvania
sitting in on a poetry class you
01:27 - might wonder why was I sitting in on
a poetry class that's a story for
01:30 - another day. But someone named
Nick Montfort was giving a presentation.
01:35 - Nick Montfort is a poet and artist and
01:38 - professor, an author who has a recent
book out actually
01:43 - called explored Tory programming. I don't see it on his website how it's a wonderful
01:48 - book that I've been actually reading
as a resource for this course as well.
01:52 - And Nick was giving a presentation
to this poetry class
01:57 - about computational techniques.
02:00 - And in writing and...
I mean it was more sophisticated and
02:05 - interesting than that but I loosely say
that it was so it was for an audience of
02:08 - people who are not necessarily familiar
with programming and algorithms.
02:11 - But are poets and writers and
looking at historical examples and
02:15 - new techniques in writing using
computational methods. And at
02:19 - the time I was kind of a recent ITP graduate I think our current ITP student.
02:23 - I don't remember and
I thought how this is interesting.
02:26 - So much of my time, this was
early in the days of processing.
02:30 - So much of my time is spent thinking about
programming for motion and animation and
02:35 - I hadn't really considered this
idea of programming for text.
02:40 - Reading a program that reads text is
a program that generates text out.
02:44 - And so at the time I actually decided
to work on some materials for
02:48 - a course called programming from A to Z.
02:53 - Strangely enough, I
02:56 - taught this course in Java which was in many ways a kind of horrifically terrible idea.
03:00 - But Java was a programming
language that I was learning and
03:03 - familiar with at the time.
03:04 - It also the basis of the
creative coding environment processing.
03:09 - And so I was a connecting some stuff
between those two environments?
03:13 - I taught this course and
I believe this was like two thousand and
03:16 - six or seven or something like that. You
could look it up if someone resourceful on
03:19 - the Internet could find the old
syllabus for a problem.
03:23 - And so a lot of the ideas for this
course came out of this presentation that
03:27 - I saw from Nick Monfort. Now
interestingly enough at the time,
03:31 - Allison Parrish was a student at I T P, I
believe she was actually a student in his
03:35 - class and when she graduated
from I T P I talked with her.
03:42 - I don't remember exactly how this
about starting a new class that
03:45 - I called in which she came up with called reading and writing electronic tech. So
03:50 - Allison Parrish is a huge inspiration for
this course as well. If you're not familiar
03:54 - with her work with generative text
performance and Twitter bots and a lot of things
04:00 - you should be familiar with. And so
04:01 - Allison teaches a course taught in
Python called reading and writing
04:05 - electronic text a lot of the materials can be found on her website. So Allison really
04:09 - took a lot of the ideas from programming from A to Z and made a much better and
04:14 - more interesting course using a much more appropriate programming language and
04:19 - environment Python to working with text. The focus of her course however is.
04:24 - is really not about I would say -- I
mean I could be wrong about this-- but
04:29 - just to make the argument for argument's
sake about really focusing on poetry
04:34 - generative text, generative poetry about the sort of core out text in text output
04:39 - not necessarily about interactive systems
as related to text and not about server
04:44 - side programming client side programming
things that happen in the process.
04:47 - So what I decided to do.
04:51 - Was recently after she
had started this course
04:54 - that I T P was to revive
programming from Ato Z
04:58 - And so now the course is once again
back and it's all about programming with
05:03 - text, text in text out but
with I would say an appropriate
05:09 - language meaning job script. Sure
a lot of a lot of innovative and
05:14 - new work with data analysis and text is happening in Python and there are tons of
05:19 - natural language processing libraries and
data libraries for processing for Python.
05:23 - But if you want to make things happen in
the web browser where users can enter
05:28 - text, receive text back.
05:29 - Participate in an era interactive
system Javascript is a language that
05:34 - is useful to make all the stuff
happen in the web browser so.
05:38 - So this is really where the ideas for
05:40 - the course came from. Now I am
going to just briefly now so
05:45 - so that's kind of the bit of much
more long winded than I had hoped but
05:49 - a bit about where some of the ideas for the course came from.
05:52 - Now I want to talk the next thing I
want to talk about is my goals for
05:55 - the course. Just so I'm not so..
05:57 - I'm standing somewhere different
with a little visual variety here.
06:00 - I have a couple fundamental goals.
06:02 - One is programming and
06:07 - algorithms. And particular in programming
I'm talking about Javascript here.
06:14 - So if you are a beginner
javascript programmer, if you
06:18 - maybe just took a single
course in P5js
06:20 - You know a little bit about javascript.
06:22 - This is a course where you can improve and
06:25 - expand your knowledge. I want to talk about
things like what's this 'prototype' thing?
06:30 - What's that this key word What's a closure or what's an anonymous function.
06:34 - All of these kind of aspects to javascript programming that you might not find in
06:39 - an introductory creative coding course.
06:41 - So I want part of the Course to be able
to get all base programming skills.
06:45 - I want that thing not just to be for the
sake of you know, programming itself but,
06:50 - to have a kind of conceptual
basis of creative output for
06:53 - you. And this is the other aspect of the course.
06:56 - So I want you to think about creative new ways to
07:03 - think about computational (am I really ritting this down?!).
07:08 - (I  am really writting this down) computational output.
07:12 - And specifically text based output oh and input.
07:18 - Right.
07:19 - So maybe you've taken a computer science course or some other javascript course and
07:24 - the focus is on web development for
professional work for
07:29 - getting a job at a start up or
maybe the Course is about algorithms. So
07:33 - you can figure out the absolute
fastest way to sort a list of numbers.
07:36 - These are not... you know there are aspectsto that those ideas that might
07:40 - be in a course like this, but my goal
is really for you to discover new and
07:45 - creative ideas and generate creative projects... playful useless!
07:50 - Experiment from this course because I believe I think I think I know that that
07:56 - you know number one : making art and
playful experiments is a
08:00 - Joyful way of interfacing with the world it can bring meaning to people's lives but
08:04 - also I think practical tools and
new discoveries come out of
08:08 - useless impractical explorations So
that's kind of a go for this course to
08:15 - augment skills and and
kind of inspire your creativity.
08:19 - OK So back to over here I want to briefly run you over what the topics will be as I
08:24 - go over them from week to week.
08:29 - This week:  I'm just going to kind of introduce
08:31 - ideas for the course I am asking
the students of the course to
08:37 - use pages as a way of publishing their
work, this is absolutely not required.
08:42 - I want to look at DOM manipulation in P5js and
08:45 - kind of compare that to other DOM
manipulation frameworks and libraries you
08:49 - might think of. I want to do tutorials about just the string object in Javascript and
08:53 - then I want to look at how you get text
input from a user in the browser a text
08:58 - box a uploading a file and
I want to do a couple coding
09:03 - challenges around making a web page that generates kind of found random poetry.
09:07 - And I'll talk about an assignment for
09:09 - you guys if that's what's going to
happen today. Regular expressions I am so
09:12 - excited for my favorite topic
ever because I like a complete
09:16 - loser that I don't know if
you love regular expressions.
09:18 - You know I am a loser you watching this are clearly not one loser such a terrible
09:23 - word that's and
I sound like I hate that word.
09:25 - Nobody.
09:26 - Anyway.
09:28 - And edit this part out!  Where's my...
09:33 - OK but reconstruction is a topic
that I love it's an amazing.
09:40 - tool puzzle, exciting, crazy
programming language kind of  unto
09:45 - itself thing that allows you to
manipulate do wonderful things with text.
09:48 - I want to look at how you can get text
from data sources different API.
09:51 - I want to look at wordnik.  I think I've
looked at word take another video
09:55 - tutorials what I want to look
at a deeper more deeply.
09:57 - I want to look at how you can get
users to fill out a Google spreadshit and
10:00 - use this as  the input to your program.
10:05 - Server side programming is a priority for me.
10:07 - So there's a lot of things that make
sense to do with only client side
10:10 - programming and P5js but I want to
look at node in particular Twitter bots.
10:14 - Fortunately I have a whole set of video
tutorials already made about Twitter bots.
10:18 - So we'll see what I can add to that for
10:20 - this week and then I kind of want
to run you through the classics.
10:24 - So my goal and hope for
10:27 - you is doing creative ideas in text
analysis of Text generation but I want to
10:31 - look at how some of these kind of classic
text generation analysis algorithms work.
10:36 - So word counting is kind of the
fundamental building block to all text analysis
10:40 - we are going to look
at a word counting program.
10:43 - TF/IDF. which is like a fancy term for
10:45 - figuring out how to delete key words
from a text based on word counting.
10:49 - I might look at these Bayesian analysis
there if I could get the courage
10:57 - and also there are a lot of no packages that will do a lot of the stuff for
11:00 - you that I'll examine.
11:02 - Text generation.
11:03 - I want to build a Markov
chain from scratch.
11:05 - I'll talk more about what that is but
a probability based system for
11:08 - generating text.
11:09 - I want to look at grammars. There's
a wonderful thing that I'll just mention
11:13 - if you're not familiar with another
work that I find really inspirational
11:16 - tracery by tracery by the way
that should not say tracery
11:19 - by tracery somebody pull request fix this.
11:21 - It should say by Galaxy Kate.
11:24 - So galaxy Kate Compton on
get her galaxy Kate .com is
11:30 - a wonderful artist programmer or a person who
has built a story generation library for
11:37 - a java script called tracery which I'll
examine later as a tutorial maybe as I
11:42 - start to figure out ways of getting guests maybe I can invite Kate to appear to talk
11:45 - about tracery back here and
then look at code for building something
11:51 - called a context free grammar.The language the term grammar might be familiar to you
11:55 - programming languages have a grammar : write function name followed by prayer.
12:00 - It's followed by a bunch of arguments
separated by commas if you're missing
12:02 - a comma that's a grammatical
error a syntax error.
12:05 - So rather than looking at language and
seeing how it fits into a jam grammar.
12:10 - If you can design a grammar and
12:12 - generate language from that, what kind of results do you get? And then also I want to
12:16 - make sure I look at chrome make
some tutorials on Chrome extensions.
12:19 - I'm going to show you  one
12:24 - of my favorite artists Addie Wagenknecht.
12:30 - She is a wonderful artist who makes
amazing work that you should become
12:33 - familiar with and
she made a Chrome extension.
12:37 - Called.
12:38 - Girls versus Git. i'm going  to pull this up here and
12:43 - you can see some of the things some of the
features that it does every user name and
12:48 - in github is replaced with a generic
female user name every GRavatar
12:51 - is replaced with the Gravatar of a woman or female type image.
12:54 - So this is something that you
can do with a Chrome extension.
12:57 - You can have control over a user's
browser and their browsing experience
13:03 - to kind of experiment
with all the strange and
13:07 - alternate ways of viewing the universe
of the web and experiencing. Obviously
13:11 - this can be used for
productivity tools and you probably have
13:15 - extensions for things like a pocket which allows you to save you all your things but
13:19 - how what kind of strange
ways can you do if you.
13:21 - You know take everybody's,
13:25 - every time you know noun is on a web
page and replace it with a food item.
13:30 - This came from an idea
somebody had in class.
13:32 - So you're just reading web pages to make yourself hungry all the time so creative
13:36 - ideas working with chrome extensions
is something that I want to pursue.
13:41 - So this is kind of
the trajectory of the course
13:45 - the Course trajectory of
the course ... I'm after this video is done.
13:48 - I'm going to make the first few videos for
13:49 - this first week on some of
the material. Now here's a quest...
13:52 - Here's here's something
I will mention to you.
13:55 - You people of the Internet can simply
just find these videos on You Tube you.
14:00 - you can write in the You Tube comments
14:00 - if you have questions and
I try to answer them when I have time and
14:04 - other people answer them as well and
I hope you will enjoy watching.
14:08 - If you want to participate in this
course to slightly augmented away.
14:12 - I will point you to Patreon.com/codingrainbow or codingrainbow.com
14:17 - You can subscribe to my Patreon
feed which is a crowdfunding system and
14:22 - with that you will get an invitation to a
slack channel where you can ask questions
14:26 - about the course and post your work in assignments and have a peer group of
14:30 - people discussing it giving you
feedback. So if you're interested.
14:32 - This is an experiment I'm trying
I'm teaching the physical class for
14:36 - ITP students at New York University.
14:39 - I'm teaching an online version of this
class for free on You Tube It is add
14:42 - supported that there will be ads for these videos. I have mixed feelings about that but
14:46 - I doing that right now for
a little bit of revenue.
14:49 - There's expenses associated
with making this, there is  time and
14:52 - then I am also experimented
with a crowdfunding platform to
14:55 - allow people a certain
additional form of interaction.
14:57 - So my kind of philosophy on
online education right now
15:00 - is free content paid interaction.But
15:05 - mostly I'm doing this because I enjoy it and I enjoy discovering a new audience and
15:09 - bringing new ideas and
doing weird dancing from time to time too.
15:14 - Ringing my bell and all
sorts of weirdness so.
15:18 - So thanks for watching this introduction
I'm sure there are lots of things I missed
15:22 - saying Aaaaah
15:24 - I thought of something I
wanted to mention to other
15:27 - the links to all of these things are in the
15:32 - In the description of this video and
to mention two other big inspirations.
15:36 - One is Lynn Cherny who does a lot of work with data analysis and presentations and
15:41 - another is Darius Kazemi also known as tiny subversions.Who is an Internet
15:46 - artist prolific creator of incredibly
strange and interesting Twitter bots.
15:51 - Basically you know I am not
15:53 - I have to admit something I am not
really a Twitter bot maker, I am a person who knows
15:57 - ohw to make it.
16:00 - And so if you're looking for inspiration
and ideas and other types of materials
16:06 - this great I want to point out both Lynn
Cherny and Kazemy  have
16:10 - 2016 talks
from the festival in Minneapolis.
16:15 - So I would recommend you find those
in all of these are great but
16:19 - if I go here to see all
I can find various.
16:24 - Books actually I'll get it where
you can find them a week to them in
16:27 - the description. But both of those are
highly relevant Cherny and Kazemi's talk
16:31 - from Io has kind of starting
16:34 - material to get you thinking about ideas or things you might want to meet if they're
16:37 - following along with this course.
16:38 - OK thank you for watching.
16:44 - And stay tuned in the next video I'll
be showing you some other stuff.
16:49 - OK ThanksByeBye!
