00:00 - hello welcome to yet another computer
00:02 - vision tutorial video in this video oh
00:05 - my god so excited I'm going to show you
00:07 - how to program from scratch not from
00:09 - scratch but how to program the raw
00:11 - algorithm algorithm for blob detection
00:13 - yourself and what do I get my blob
00:14 - detection so in two videos back I made
00:17 - an example that finds it's over here no
00:20 - it's over here where is it okay over
00:21 - here that finds this cup that I have
00:23 - taped to my green screen behind me by
00:25 - looking for the average location of all
00:27 - the red pixels it finds and this works
00:30 - perfectly beautifully nicely however
00:32 - there's a problem if I add a second cup
00:35 - look at the average location is in
00:37 - between those two things and I want to
00:39 - be able to track them individually as
00:41 - individual blobs so how do we do that so
00:44 - I want to talk about how this algorithm
00:46 - works
00:47 - so let's what's going on here there is a
00:50 - an image that the camera is seeing it is
00:53 - seeing two red cups take to a wall don't
00:57 - know what what my life has become that
00:59 - I'm taping plastic cups to walls that
01:01 - are painted green but that's just what
01:03 - it is
01:03 - hi okay so it's looking at every single
01:07 - pixel and it's asking a question is this
01:10 - red and you know you can insert
01:12 - something else there is this a bright
01:14 - pixel is it a dark pixel is it a blue
01:16 - pixel you know you could be using a
01:18 - Kinect and depth tracking is it a closed
01:21 - pixel is it a far pixel there's lots of
01:22 - things you could substitute for this
01:24 - question but for my demonstration of the
01:25 - algorithm it's going to work nicely if I
01:27 - ask is it red and so the answer is going
01:29 - to be no is it red no is it red no is it
01:32 - red no no no it's a very negative
01:33 - program just no no no no no no no no no
01:36 - no no no no but eventually at some point
01:39 - a little bit it gets to over here is it
01:42 - red it's like yes yes it's red so if
01:46 - it's red then we have to ask the
01:48 - question is it did I find a red pixel
01:51 - before or is this a new and I thought if
01:53 - I found the first red pixel and as soon
01:55 - as it's fine the first red pixel it has
01:57 - to make a blob
01:59 - so the blob is going to be a Java class
02:03 - an object which is a blog it's going to
02:05 - say I found the first red pixel so I'm
02:07 - making a blob object and I'm going to
02:09 - call this
02:10 - a and blob a has an X a Y and a width
02:15 - and a height it's like a little
02:16 - rectangle now what happens next oh it
02:21 - goes to the next pixel is it red yes
02:23 - it's red yes it's red is it near one of
02:28 - the existing blobs it is so let's just
02:30 - put it in blob a and maybe blob a gets a
02:32 - little wider it looks for the next pixel
02:34 - oh it's near blob a put into blob a make
02:36 - a little wider it keeps going this says
02:37 - no no no it's another one no it's part
02:39 - of blob a no no no no no no no it
02:40 - eventually gets out here to fight little
02:41 - baby yes well is it near blob a and it
02:44 - suddenly realizes No look at that that
02:46 - distance is greater than some threshold
02:48 - it's time for me to make another blob so
02:52 - it's looking for all the red pixels and
02:54 - finding the clusters of red pixels near
02:56 - each other within some that are far
02:59 - enough by some thresholds amount so
03:01 - that's the algorithm we need to program
03:02 - and the blob I'm going to think of
03:04 - really just as a rectangle it's going to
03:06 - have an X and a Y and it's going to have
03:08 - a width and a height okay so let's see
03:11 - if we can make that happen okay so now
03:14 - what I need to do okay the first thing
03:15 - I'm going to do is I'm going to make a
03:16 - blob a new tab in this processing sketch
03:20 - okay good and I'm going to give it an X
03:24 - a Y and a width and a height and then I
03:27 - need a constructor and the constructor
03:31 - when I make the first blob it gets an X
03:34 - and a y this is tricky so what's the X
03:38 - is going to be that X the Y is going to
03:40 - be that Y and the width is going to be a
03:43 - width of one and the height is going to
03:44 - be a height of one okay great so that's
03:47 - what happens when I first make the blob
03:48 - oops now let's think about this so now
03:52 - let's go back to this algorithm and I
03:55 - don't need what do I need
03:57 - hmm I need to have some sort of lip
04:00 - variable list of blobs so I'm going to
04:08 - make an ArrayList of blob objects now if
04:10 - array lists are new to you it's like a
04:12 - flexibly sized array so I can start with
04:15 - none and I can add more and that sort of
04:16 - thing and this is something that I
04:17 - encourage you to look into
04:20 - and one thing that I'm going to have to
04:22 - do plus my train of thought okay one
04:25 - thing I would have to do is say blobs
04:29 - clear so this is something that's going
04:31 - to be really really key and I'm going to
04:33 - bring this up again later but when I
04:35 - look this algorithm is going to do is
04:36 - just show me a snapshot of blobs at this
04:39 - moment in time and then a snapshot of
04:42 - blobs at the next moment in time but
04:43 - it's not going to know which blob is
04:44 - which over time but I'm going to get to
04:46 - that in a future video
04:47 - talk more about that a little bit so I
04:49 - don't need this average location anymore
04:50 - I don't need this count this is all from
04:52 - my previous example but what I'm doing
04:55 - here is what happens as soon as I find a
04:59 - pixel that meets this red threshold well
05:02 - what I need to do what I'm going to do
05:04 - is just say blob B is a new blob at that
05:08 - particular X and y and then I'm going to
05:10 - say blobs dot add blob B so this is the
05:14 - idea any time I find a pixel I make a
05:16 - new blob only I don't always make a new
05:19 - blob right I only make a new blob well
05:21 - when would I make a new blob if blobs is
05:25 - empty then I make a new blob right so if
05:31 - there are no blobs and I found a pixel
05:33 - it has to be now otherwise and I'm going
05:37 - to do this a slightly different way but
05:39 - another way that I could do that is for
05:41 - every blob let's add a boolean variable
05:47 - saying found is false so I want to loop
05:50 - through every blob and say is one of
05:52 - these blobs my home so if there are no
05:55 - blobs by the way if not found then I add
06:04 - a new blob to that ArrayList so this is
06:07 - the algorithms over here I start by
06:10 - assuming while I haven't found a blob
06:12 - it's a home for this pixel but now I'm
06:14 - going to look through all the blobs and
06:16 - see if one of those is a home if after
06:18 - that loop which I haven't written yet I
06:20 - still haven't found one then this this
06:22 - pixel is a new blob okay so the very
06:25 - first thing I need to do is say what is
06:27 - the distance or let's just write it this
06:30 - way if B
06:33 - contains or is near let's write a
06:36 - function called is near think I think
06:38 - actually an example that I saw it was
06:39 - called that if glob is near this
06:42 - particular XY point so that's one thing
06:45 - I can do to check what's the distance
06:46 - between this XY point and this
06:48 - particular blob so let's go to the blob
06:51 - now and say is let's write a function
06:54 - that's a boolean function it's got to
06:55 - return true or false is near and it gets
06:58 - an X I'm going to call this like I'll
07:01 - just use X underscore I should come up
07:03 - with a different somebody suggest a
07:05 - better variable name but if this
07:07 - particular XY point is near I need to
07:10 - either return true or false so the first
07:12 - thing I need to do is what's the
07:13 - distance between X Y and x/y
07:17 - so I'm going to call this like px for
07:20 - like pixel X and let's do that up here
07:23 - too I don't like this underscore thing
07:25 - it looks so obnoxious
07:26 - no I don't have any note that I have any
07:28 - problems with underscores then
07:29 - underscores are lovely nice characters
07:32 - but I'm going to call it px for like
07:34 - pixel X but actually here's the thing I
07:37 - actually want to test I think I want to
07:40 - test if it's near the center of the blob
07:42 - not the corner of the blob so one thing
07:44 - I'm going to do is say see accent CX for
07:48 - Center X is X plus W divided by 2 and
07:52 - see Y is X plus y plus h divided by 2
07:57 - that's finding the center right X plus
07:59 - the width no no that's not the center X
08:02 - plus the width divided by - don't be
08:04 - ridiculous
08:05 - X plus width divided by 2
08:10 - thank you very much y plus height
08:13 - divided by 2 that's the center right if
08:15 - you have a rectangle X plus the width of
08:17 - the rectangle divided by 2 that's the
08:19 - center location so I want to know if
08:20 - that pixel is within some distance now
08:29 - again I could use let's use distance
08:31 - Square to like not Oh don't I have
08:33 - distance squared in this example right
08:36 - here there it is oh but it's only hot
08:38 - that's a 3d distance let's let's make a
08:42 - 2d version of it I have this from a
08:45 - previous example where I was using
08:46 - in color by the way did you know in Java
08:51 - you can just have the function with the
08:53 - same name as long as it's two different
08:55 - arguments two different sets of
08:56 - arguments it'll know which one to call
08:58 - that's called method overloading okay
08:59 - so I'm going to go back here and I'm
09:02 - going to say if the distance is less
09:04 - than some particular
09:09 - threshold I don't know what's a good
09:10 - distance let's say 50 pixels away if
09:13 - it's within let's say within 25 pixels
09:15 - then then return true and this is
09:19 - definitely a variable that I'm going to
09:20 - want to make up something that I can
09:22 - change otherwise a return false okay so
09:30 - now what I'm going to do is and I know
09:33 - all this stuff is irrelevant this was
09:35 - from my previous example so if a blob is
09:39 - near X Y then first of all I want to do
09:43 - is blob add X Y I want to add that point
09:46 - to the blob and then I want to say found
09:48 - equals true and then I'm going to say
09:51 - break now there's a little bit of a
09:53 - problem here where I probably should
09:55 - check all the blobs and find like the
09:58 - clothed the one that it's closest to but
10:00 - I'm not going to worry about that right
10:01 - now I'm just going to do this loop to
10:03 - find I'm just going to find the first
10:04 - one so now I need to add that X Y so
10:08 - here I need to write a function add that
10:12 - pixel X and pixel Y so what does that do
10:15 - well the thing that I need to change is
10:18 - I need to I need to check oh this is
10:24 - tricky here let's think about this for a
10:27 - second I'm gonna use a diagram there's
10:28 - probably a smarter way I could do this
10:30 - maybe somebody in the chat or will give
10:32 - me a suggestion but let's say at some
10:34 - point I have a blob like this and it has
10:39 - an x and y and it has a width and a
10:42 - height so the first thing I need to
10:43 - figure out is is that pixel inside this
10:48 - rectangle is all right if it's inside
10:49 - that rectangle I don't do anything if
10:51 - it's over here I suddenly want my
10:53 - rectangle to be like that if it's over
10:56 - here I certainly want my rectangle to be
10:58 - like that so you know what I think I
10:59 - want to change about my blob I'm going
11:02 - to change something I'm going to tap the
11:05 - blob instead of having X Y wh
11:08 - I'm going to have min X min Y max x max
11:16 - Y I'm just going to keep track of the
11:18 - top left and bottom right corner of the
11:20 - blob
11:22 - and actually that allows me to have this
11:23 - argument bxy and I'm just going to say
11:26 - when the blob starts minimum X and the
11:32 - minimum Y and the maximum X and the
11:35 - maximum Y and I could have called those
11:40 - bottom bottom bottom X Y top X Y but
11:44 - anyway all those are that now when I
11:46 - check if it's near now I am getting the
11:50 - average so I'm going to say minimum X
11:54 - plus maximum X divided by 2 and minimum
12:01 - y plus maximum Y divided by 2 the
12:04 - distance is still the same thing between
12:07 - this X Y and then the add function is
12:09 - going to be easier because what I'm
12:11 - going to do is I'm going to say minimum
12:14 - x equals the minimum of X and minimum X
12:21 - this is a processing function minimum
12:23 - that says if X is less than minimum X
12:27 - whichever one of these is less use that
12:30 - one so I should be able to just do this
12:33 - and the same thing here like this so I
12:42 - just want to get I could have written if
12:44 - statements like if X is less than
12:45 - minimum X then the minimum X is now X
12:47 - that sort of thing but this should do
12:50 - that trick this should add the blob okay
12:54 - and then by the way what do I've got
12:57 - here I've got everything I need to draw
12:59 - a rectangle so I'm going to write a
13:01 - function called show and I'm going to
13:04 - say a stroke 0 fill 255 and I'm going to
13:09 - say just stroke weight 2 so I make sure
13:13 - it's kind of thick and then I'm going to
13:14 - say rect mode corners by the way in
13:18 - processing the rectangle mode corners
13:20 - allows you to specify the top left and
13:22 - the bottom right of a rectangle and
13:23 - those are the values I have so I'm going
13:25 - to say rect min X min Y max X max Y so I
13:30 - added all of the blob does a couple
13:32 - things
13:33 - it checks to see if a pixel is near it
13:35 - and could say true or false it also can
13:37 - add that pixel to expand or contract its
13:39 - rectangle and then it could also draw
13:41 - that rectangle and now in this
13:43 - particular algorithm this is it I think
13:47 - I've got everything here if it's near
13:49 - but if it's near at that point I found
13:53 - it otherwise add a new blob and then at
13:56 - the end here after I go through all the
13:59 - pixels I should be able to go through
14:02 - all of the blobs and say blob dot show
14:06 - okay I'm sure I missed something but
14:13 - let's try running it the variable P X
14:17 - does not exist oh right because this is
14:20 - now x and y Oh max x equals x I have an
14:26 - error in the chat so it's telling me
14:28 - there's an error in the constructor max
14:30 - thank you okay
14:31 - so this was a big error that would have
14:32 - caused me a major problem okay here we
14:38 - go
14:38 - let's see what I've got here now what is
14:42 - that craziness oh look at this it's
14:44 - finding zillions of little tiny blob
14:47 - look at all the little tiny blobs a
14:49 - little tiny pops look find some more
14:51 - little tiny blobs so I think my distance
14:54 - threshold needs to be a little bit
14:56 - bigger 25 pixels so that's just
15:00 - something I need to make make a variable
15:04 - so I want to make this a variable let's
15:06 - just do this right now
15:08 - all right because this all the way I was
15:09 - distance squared so it wasn't so crazy
15:11 - so I'm going to make a so this is the
15:14 - color threshold and I want to make a
15:16 - distance threshold and I'm going to say
15:19 - that's equal to 25 just having these be
15:21 - the same and first of all this needs to
15:24 - be distance threshold Times distance
15:25 - threshold and I'm going to add a just
15:29 - right now I'm going to add key pressed
15:31 - function and I'm going to say if the key
15:34 - equals a then distance threshold plus
15:39 - plus else if key equals Z and this is a
15:43 - really quick way for me to just adjust
15:44 - that - - and then
15:48 - print line distance threshold just so I
15:50 - can modify it on the fly here we go come
15:56 - on everybody
15:56 - here come the blobs he come the blah Oz
16:00 - blobs the musical here oh yeah much
16:02 - better so we can see here now tada
16:07 - now this is still getting multiple blobs
16:09 - and I can tweak things for example I
16:12 - should probably click on the color look
16:14 - my lips are a blob my fingers are a blob
16:17 - but you can see one thing one thing I
16:20 - can do here let's zoom into this is I
16:23 - can consider blobs of a certain size to
16:26 - be useless so I can one thing I can do
16:30 - is say here right I could say if blob
16:38 - dot size oh if B dot size is greater
16:45 - than 100 look for example I can only
16:47 - show right now blobs that have a certain
16:49 - size and there is no size function but I
16:51 - could write one and I could just say you
16:54 - know return max X minus min X x max Y
17:01 - minus min Y like the width and the
17:04 - height of the blob so to speak I
17:05 - multiply them together and you know I
17:08 - could say I could you know they have to
17:10 - be greater than like you know 500 this
17:14 - would get rid of small blobs right oh
17:18 - and that threshold yeah yeah I meant to
17:20 - I meant too by the way so you know this
17:24 - is also what I can change here let me
17:26 - add the second one and you can see how
17:29 - nicely this is working out hey arm is
17:31 - blocked we go over here and you can see
17:34 - you could see what I'm getting now I
17:36 - could still that threshold you can see
17:39 - that there's two blobs up top there let
17:41 - me make that threshold if I keep making
17:42 - that threshold there we go now it's just
17:45 - one blob and again I could do things
17:47 - like interpolate or whatever and let's
17:50 - do this and here we are and oh boy we
17:54 - have to do something
17:57 - ah I mean by the loss cause it's not
18:02 - what it meant to - come on give me some
18:05 - read I am
18:10 - blob man okay anyway whatever they get
18:20 - the point so this I think that stuff
18:22 - music student so I think I've shown you
18:24 - the basic idea of the blob algorithm
18:27 - there's I think a bunch of things I
18:28 - could improve your when I could make a
18:29 - nicer interface to kind of tweak these
18:31 - thresholds of color the distance
18:33 - threshold you know might be nice to sort
18:35 - of draw the rectangle blob rectangle
18:36 - with some alpha so I could see what's
18:38 - behind it you know one thing that's
18:40 - really kind of important about this to
18:43 - mention I'll mention this again is come
18:48 - back to me
18:49 - code is that whoops it's funny it worked
18:53 - much better without me clicking on it
18:56 - anyway is that there's no sense of and I
18:59 - should so by the way this this distance
19:02 - that threshold should really be like 75
19:05 - to start with and let's make this like
19:08 - let's make this less I don't know what
19:10 - I'm doing here um so one of the things
19:12 - that's really important is let's say you
19:14 - wanted to have an image follow this cup
19:19 - and an image follow this cup look it's
19:21 - working beautifully right now an image
19:22 - follow this cup and an image follow this
19:24 - cup like what if I wanted to put a cat
19:25 - over here and a dog over here well it's
19:29 - not I'm not always going to you know I
19:30 - might like this blob is going to be
19:32 - found first because of the way I'm
19:34 - iterating through the pixels so this
19:35 - blob is always going to be blob zero but
19:38 - now this blob is going to be blob zero
19:39 - this cup that is its blob zero but it's
19:42 - this other Cup so these blobs do not
19:44 - there's no way these blobs don't have ID
19:46 - numbers there's no way to track them
19:47 - over time however that is something we
19:50 - could add so I'm going to show you how
19:51 - to do that boy this is working so nicely
19:53 - I'm so pleased
19:53 - oh I look I I can put Mickey Mouse ears
20:00 - on myself I need anyway I'm gonna go do
20:02 - this on my own time you don't need to
20:03 - like watch me do the weird stuff with
20:05 - the blob but um I'm going to do that in
20:08 - a future video
20:09 - one last thing so ultimately you know if
20:12 - you want to do this and i'ma show these
20:13 - in another video there are ample sets of
20:16 - processing libraries there's blob
20:18 - detection there's open CV there's a lot
20:20 - of processing libraries that will do
20:21 - this there's also something that I
20:22 - haven't implemented this algorithm which
20:23 - is actually to find the contours of this
20:25 - cup I'm just finding kind of the minimum
20:27 - maximum area of the blob so those types
20:30 - of things I would recommend thinking
20:32 - about contours but and so I'm going to
20:34 - show you at some point how to do this
20:36 - stuff without writing all the code for
20:37 - yourself but just use a library that
20:39 - does the same thing but it is
20:39 - interesting to see one thing that I
20:41 - think is good to see about this is a lot
20:43 - of the libraries are built in just to
20:45 - look for bright or dark blobs and so you
20:47 - would have to apply some type of
20:48 - brightness threshold to the image first
20:50 - before passing it to the blob detection
20:52 - library which would be fine but custom
20:54 - baking it yourself you can just like
20:55 - look for a specific color like red okay
20:57 - thank you for watching this blob
20:59 - detection video I'm hoping it was useful
21:01 - and I'll see you in the future computer
21:04 - vision videos good bye
