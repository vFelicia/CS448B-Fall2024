00:00 - hello in this video I'm gonna look at
00:03 - how if you have a live capture coming in
00:06 - from a camera into a web page how you
00:09 - can add a button to that page and save
00:11 - snapshots overtime photobooth like kind
00:14 - of sketch and I'm using p5 to s so this
00:16 - is where I'm starting I have a simple p5
00:19 - example which has a canvas which is here
00:21 - it has a video Dom element over here the
00:23 - Dom element is grabbing the image from
00:25 - the camera and then I'm drawing it into
00:26 - the canvas so let's go over to the code
00:29 - and I've got the code here you can see
00:31 - that create capture video change the
00:34 - size of 320 by 240 and draw that onto
00:36 - the canvas so first thing I want to do
00:38 - is just stop drawing it onto the canvas
00:40 - and we can see this is what I've got now
00:43 - and I want to add a button to the page
00:45 - so I'm going to say create button snap
00:51 - and if i refresh it you can see there's
00:54 - that button and make this a little bit
00:56 - bigger and you can see there's that
00:57 - button snap so the idea here is that I
00:59 - want is whenever I hit the button
01:03 - I want that image to be saved and
01:04 - populated into the canvas so how do we
01:07 - do that
01:07 - so the first thing I need to do is bind
01:09 - some sort of event to the pressing of
01:11 - this button and the way that that's done
01:12 - in p5 is with well first of all once
01:16 - again if I want to do anything with that
01:18 - button I now need a variable to keep
01:20 - track of that button over time so I'm
01:22 - gonna add a variable called button at
01:24 - the top and I'm gonna say button equals
01:26 - create button and then I will say button
01:28 - dot Mouse pressed and I'll call this
01:32 - take snap so what goes in here is the
01:37 - name of a function that I want to
01:39 - execute when I press the mouse on that
01:42 - button and this is PFI specific there
01:43 - are lots of ways in JavaScript with
01:45 - other frameworks and native JavaScript
01:47 - and jQuery to do this same sort of thing
01:48 - but np5 has a nice simple hook for a
01:51 - binding an event to the press of the
01:52 - mouse which is naming a function that
01:54 - goes into the mouse press function
01:55 - that's an that's called on the button
01:57 - object itself so once I've done that
01:59 - it's now my job to write a function
02:02 - called take snap and in that function
02:05 - what could I do
02:06 - I could take exactly this line of code
02:08 - that just draws what is currently in the
02:11 - video to the canvas so if I save this
02:14 - and I go back and run this again we
02:16 - should see now that the video is playing
02:19 - if video is capturing there's nothing in
02:22 - the canvas but you can see that as soon
02:26 - as I hit that button I get the current
02:29 - image into the canvas and now I can do
02:32 - this and you can see I can kind of
02:33 - create a little like stop-motion dance
02:37 - animation so we make it get out of this
02:39 - if they want to know what I'm doing
02:40 - anymore got lost in my own little world
02:42 - therefore sigh can we turn off the video
02:43 - and just dance the night away even
02:46 - though it's 11 o'clock in the morning
02:47 - which is not really the morning I
02:48 - digress so let's try to make this though
02:52 - a little bit more interesting here which
02:54 - is that I didn't really save anything I
02:57 - don't know what it means to save
02:58 - anything you certainly could like
02:59 - download the image to the computer we
03:01 - could ask that actually that could be a
03:02 - feature we could add but what I think
03:05 - might be interesting to look at is how
03:07 - might I save those images over time so
03:10 - since I have this white board over here
03:12 - I feel obligated to use it let's think
03:13 - about this for a second I need some sort
03:15 - of nap this out for myself so we have
03:18 - the canvas we have the video and the
03:26 - only thing that I'm doing is that
03:28 - particular moment in time I'm drawing
03:30 - you know the image from the video to the
03:35 - canvas but what if I could do something
03:38 - in the interim over here and the thing
03:40 - that I want to do is actually call the
03:43 - function get so get is a function that
03:48 - maybe I'll get to a little more later
03:51 - which is a way of like grabbing pixels
03:54 - from the image itself but if I call get
03:58 - with no arguments what it does is it
03:59 - grabs an entire copy of that image so
04:02 - what if I had a array when I called it
04:07 - history so a blank array like this and
04:11 - every time I press a button I add a copy
04:17 - of the image to that array so I'm
04:19 - actually storing image after image after
04:22 - image whenever that button is pressed
04:23 - that way I could potentially in my
04:26 - canvas
04:27 - I could see a whole bunch of images
04:31 - snapshots over time so let's take a look
04:34 - at how we might do that okay so let's go
04:39 - back to the code what are some things I
04:40 - want to add the first thing I want to
04:42 - add and audio still working is a
04:43 - variable called history which will just
04:46 - be an array so an empty array and now I
04:49 - said instead of instead of right here
04:54 - just drawing the image drawing the image
04:58 - to the screen when the button is pressed
05:00 - what I want to do instead is say
05:02 - something like this
05:03 - history dot push video push being a
05:08 - function history is an array video is
05:11 - the video Dom element push being a
05:13 - function that adds something to that
05:14 - array so I'm going to add the video Dom
05:17 - element add the video Dom element every
05:19 - time I press the button only that's not
05:20 - what I want to do so this looks kind of
05:22 - right like Oh every time I press the
05:24 - button add you know the image from the
05:25 - video to the right but this the variable
05:27 - video is not the image it's the entirety
05:30 - of that Dom element live capture stream
05:32 - thing itself so that's not what I want
05:34 - in the array what I want is just a copy
05:37 - of that image so I need to use that get
05:39 - function so if I come back over here and
05:41 - I say video dot get this is what I want
05:45 - so you know I can run this right now but
05:49 - oh history dot push is not a function
05:51 - why is that not a function yes it is is
06:00 - is history some other variable a name
06:03 - for something let's call this as
06:05 - snapshots is is something else called
06:08 - history in the world of JavaScript yeah
06:11 - that's strange somebody will tell me
06:13 - what that was so sometimes if you get
06:14 - that error you know this is by the way I
06:16 - made a video about namespacing linked to
06:19 - it now but something you could walk into
06:21 - by accident which apparently I just did
06:23 - in JavaScript especially working with p5
06:25 - is that making up all these like global
06:27 - variables and there's a lot of default
06:28 - stuff
06:29 - yeah history browser history I'm sure
06:31 - there's a global variable that just
06:33 - exists in web browsers called history
06:35 - that has to do with the browser history
06:36 - and I just messed up by overriding that
06:38 - so watch out danger danger don't do that
06:41 - so I'll call it snapshots and what I
06:44 - want to do now is we can look at here
06:48 - snapshots is an empty array so this is
06:52 - the chrome developer console I recently
06:53 - made a video about how to use that and
06:55 - now if I hit snap a couple times and
06:58 - look at snapshots again you can see that
07:01 - now it has an array with a bunch of p5
07:03 - images in it and there's more stuff with
07:06 - these p5 images that up that we can kind
07:08 - of look into width and height and all of
07:10 - that but let's not worry about that
07:11 - right now
07:12 - now how can I do something with these
07:14 - images well one thing I could do let's
07:18 - um let's do one thing with it let's make
07:20 - the canvas wider and in draw let's add a
07:26 - loop that says for VAR I equals 0 I is
07:31 - less than snapshots dot length I plus
07:35 - plus let's draw image snapshots index I
07:43 - let's draw all of those images so this
07:46 - is gonna I don't know what this is
07:47 - really gonna accomplish but let's run
07:48 - this and you can see now it's only
07:52 - showing the last one why is it I did a
07:54 - loop to draw every single one it's only
07:56 - showing the last one
07:57 - well it's drawing them all the the but
08:00 - it's drawing them all on top of each
08:02 - other so one thing I could do that would
08:03 - be kind of interesting I've no idea if
08:05 - this is gonna work is I could add some
08:08 - alpha so look at that now you can see
08:14 - that it's drawing them on I'm getting a
08:16 - nice little ghost averaging thing I got
08:18 - because I'm tinting them as I'm drawing
08:21 - them let's draw them next to each other
08:23 - so one thing I might want to do is draw
08:25 - them a lot smaller like maybe I'll just
08:26 - draw them at 80 by 60 and maybe I'll
08:29 - actually make that a variable 80 and 60
08:34 - and use those variables and I'll say let
08:39 - me have an x and a y so what I'm doing
08:45 - here is I want to draw each image at a
08:48 - particular x and a y as I'm looping
08:50 - through the array the first one at 0 0
08:51 - the second one at x equals x
08:55 - plus W so now what you would see is you
09:02 - can see here that each one is drawing
09:04 - next each other now when it gets to the
09:06 - edge of the window which is over here
09:09 - maybe what I wanted to do if X is
09:12 - greater than W then I want to reset X
09:15 - back to 0 and have Y go up by H so I'm
09:18 - just making a little algorithm inside
09:20 - this loop that no matter how many images
09:21 - there are they're each being drawn X is
09:24 - moving over when X gets to the end X
09:26 - goes back to 0 and Y goes down so now I
09:29 - can run this and we should see here's
09:31 - the video down here and I can ooh what
09:35 - happened there
09:36 - if X is greater than W that's not
09:39 - correct if X is greater than the width
09:41 - of the canvas not W which is just 1 over
09:43 - so that's no good so let's run this
09:46 - again and then I'm gonna you can see my
09:50 - little kind of stop-motion boy bridge
09:53 - sequence now incidentally it's kind of
09:55 - funny that I'm doing this right here
09:56 - like pressing the button because I could
09:58 - just as easily do this so so anyway so
10:00 - you get the idea here there's a lot of
10:01 - possibilities I have this whole array I
10:03 - can mix and match them I could create a
10:04 - puzzle could chop it up I mean my mind
10:06 - just bursting with ideas and I hope
10:08 - yours is as well but and you can see
10:10 - also like that the I don't know if you
10:11 - can see this in this recording of the
10:13 - video but the program is running a bit
10:14 - slower now I have this big array of
10:16 - images but but I wanted to do one more
10:21 - thing which what I want to do let's say
10:25 - I this is a little bit insane these you
10:28 - should just stop watching this now but I
10:30 - want to see if I can make these be in
10:33 - motion so I want to see just sort of
10:35 - like the last however many images and I
10:38 - want them all to be on a delay and
10:39 - moving let's just see if we can do this
10:42 - 10 minutes into this video you can think
10:44 - of this as completing the lesson but
10:46 - let's just see if we can make this
10:47 - happen so let's think about this for a
10:49 - second
10:51 - what I might want to do is first what
10:56 - happens if I just put this in draw
10:58 - itself okay so I'm saying push video dot
11:05 - get and let's and let
11:09 - let's let's run this for a second and
11:10 - count it and I'm gonna run this for a
11:13 - second we complained so one thing that
11:16 - happened is that the video a draw
11:18 - happens immediately but the video wasn't
11:20 - actually ready just yet so I need a sad
11:23 - sad world we live in what I need is an
11:27 - event I wonder if I can add an event
11:29 - here called ready and I make a variable
11:35 - called go equals false and now I'm gonna
11:38 - said go so I think there should be a
11:41 - callback to create I don't know if this
11:42 - exists in p5 we're about to find out
11:44 - there should be most of these functions
11:46 - in JavaScript have a callback like
11:48 - create the capture and use but it's not
11:50 - what I need to know when you're done
11:52 - creating it so I could use it
11:53 - and so I passed a callback called ready
11:56 - and I'm just gonna set a boolean
11:57 - variable equal to true so I can say only
12:00 - if go then start capturing those
12:05 - snapshots and I can take this out here
12:08 - as I've gotten rid of the button and I'm
12:10 - gonna have to we don't need this button
12:12 - anymore that worked so you can see
12:16 - what's happening here
12:17 - so now let me pause this let me say no
12:20 - loop so I need to do something
12:22 - ridiculous which is count this 1 2 3 4 5
12:26 - 6 7 8 9 10 times for there are 40 so I
12:30 - need an array with 40 so I only want to
12:33 - what I want to do is actually I want to
12:37 - change and have a counter so I want to
12:39 - create a counter because I don't want to
12:42 - I only want to have 40 images at a time
12:44 - so what I want to do is add a counter so
12:47 - instead of just always adding an image
12:49 - to the array or what I want to say is
12:51 - snapshots index counter equals video get
12:55 - so this is going to do the same exact
12:57 - thing I'm going to be I'm going to add
13:00 - images to that array and run this again
13:05 - counter equals 0 why didn't that work
13:07 - somebody let's see what this error is a
13:11 - sketch dot 4 I have a syntax error
13:14 - oh it boy my land isn't my mind is in
13:17 - Java land var should be the name of the
13:19 - variable so I'm going to do this
13:21 - and we can see ah so it's working but I
13:24 - didn't increase the counter so I need to
13:27 - say counter plus plus and now you can
13:31 - see this is working now what I could do
13:33 - is say aha
13:34 - when counter gets to 40 go back to zero
13:37 - so now I could say if counter equals 40
13:41 - because there's only 40 total counter
13:44 - should go back to zero okay so now this
13:49 - is a good time to do jumping jacks I
13:52 - have to do them over here right you can
13:55 - see my trail of jumping jacks is
13:58 - happening up here you know there may be
14:00 - like a second spaced apart you can see
14:02 - it's still doing it and do I still have
14:04 - that tint in there that's funny I still
14:06 - have the tint let's get rid of that and
14:08 - refresh I forgot that I had that the
14:10 - whole time no wonder this is what I
14:11 - expected it to look like I'll do some
14:13 - jumping jacks so you can see now I don't
14:16 - know why the bottom maybe I did my math
14:18 - wrong there 43
14:21 - did I get the math wrong there uh
14:24 - counter equals 43 let's try that you
14:28 - know I obviously could do some actual
14:30 - correct math there we go so now you can
14:31 - see I've got this like history of the
14:34 - last 43 images always continuously there
14:37 - and I want to do something a little bit
14:39 - weird so this is pretty good and I think
14:42 - you could probably make some creative
14:43 - experiments with this and make it bigger
14:45 - or smaller or whatever but and I'm just
14:47 - like off the deep end here by Billy a
14:48 - fifteen minutes so this is fine so let's
14:50 - think about how to make this
14:51 - notice that I'm always just drawing the
14:54 - images 0
14:56 - through 243 and let's make that I don't
15:00 - know why that's the VAT let's make this
15:02 - total equal 40 let's make that a
15:04 - variable I swear I don't understand my
15:06 - math here but just gonna go with it so
15:09 - one thing I want to do is that in
15:12 - addition to drawing the images I want to
15:17 - offset them this is gonna like seem
15:19 - weird but let me let me just do this and
15:21 - maybe it's gonna makes it's making sense
15:23 - in my head right now
15:24 - because I think I've done this before
15:25 - many years ago but I'm going to what if
15:28 - I said I plus frame count so in other
15:30 - words I want the zero image to be here
15:33 - then the zero image to be there then
15:34 - image to be there every frame but as
15:37 - soon as we get past 43 I need you to use
15:39 - the modulus operation boy modulus might
15:44 - not be familiar some of you I believe I
15:46 - made a video only about modulus at one
15:48 - point and so let's make this a separate
15:51 - variable just so we can kind of discuss
15:53 - what's going on here pretty sure this is
15:55 - gonna work so let me run this see if
16:01 - this does what I expect look I have an
16:04 - error so I must have got oh so first of
16:08 - all I could only do this once counter
16:12 - has got I need I need 40 images first to
16:15 - start with so so this is only going to
16:19 - work once 43 or whatever once I have the
16:21 - total amount so this one so I wouldn't
16:25 - think of like a really simple way to
16:26 - approach this I'm just gonna say if if
16:33 - oh you know what I don't never mind
16:35 - right this is silly all I need to do is
16:37 - say snapshots dot length because I can
16:42 - just do this based on how many elements
16:44 - are currently in the array so now you
16:49 - can see that ah that's what I was hoping
16:51 - for okay so you can see that
16:53 - everything's moving why did this work I
16:56 - mean I so this is uh this is a pretty
17:00 - standard kind of like trope I would say
17:02 - in kind of creative coding looking at
17:05 - this video and seeing like many many
17:07 - copies of it on a slight delay we could
17:08 - make that delay bigger or smaller we
17:09 - could kind of cycle it around I made a
17:11 - project like 10 years ago that does
17:12 - exactly this I think I called it time
17:14 - frame and I I just have to do like my
17:18 - sub weird like though dancing I think to
17:21 - see what this looks like okay but let's
17:27 - try to think about why this is working
17:29 - for a second and again you know I don't
17:31 - know if anyone's still watching this
17:32 - video like 20 minutes in but I hope that
17:34 - you make some creative projects with
17:36 - this you might run into an issue by the
17:38 - way if you don't have that p5.js bug fix
17:40 - but I can help you with that but let's
17:43 - think about this so remember this is the
17:45 - array and let's just
17:48 - pretend the array has one two three four
17:51 - five things in it and you know the
17:55 - animation looks something like this now
18:00 - supposed to be me with one arm so you
18:02 - can see like the of an animation of a
18:04 - dial going like this so this is the
18:06 - canvas and this is continuously also
18:10 - shifting and getting new elements in it
18:12 - but what's happening is so the current
18:17 - the actual current frame is is going in
18:21 - one at a time so without that strange
18:23 - modulus really it's trying to make this
18:27 - make sense I don't know that this is the
18:29 - best drawing but without that modulus
18:31 - what I was seeing here is just literally
18:33 - the array copied into the window so we
18:36 - see these static images that are getting
18:37 - updated every once in a while but if
18:40 - what I'm doing is actually the zero
18:42 - element of the array gets drawn here
18:44 - then it gets drawn here then it gets
18:45 - drawn here then it gets drawn here
18:47 - you're actually saying end of one
18:48 - element is also moving you're actually
18:50 - seeing that animation it's in the array
18:51 - play out because each spot on the screen
18:54 - that static is seeing different elements
18:56 - from the array but the array is also
18:58 - being updated by the current elements
19:00 - from the camera and so how is that
19:02 - working basically what I want this is
19:05 - gonna I now I know how to make sense of
19:07 - this right I'm gonna put the index
19:10 - values here so first the index values go
19:13 - like this then the next time the index
19:16 - values go like this and then the next
19:19 - time
19:21 - oops I only have four here I messed up
19:25 - but you get the idea then go like this
19:28 - so then the next time it's three four
19:30 - zero one one two so those are cycling so
19:34 - how do you do that if you always have if
19:36 - you have that loop this is I so okay
19:40 - sorry this is i 0 1 2 3 this is I plus
19:46 - frame count which would be 0 1 2 3 and
19:51 - then 1 2 3 4 then 2 3 4 5 then 3 4 5 6
19:59 - right so this is I plus frame cap
20:02 - the modulus operation if I was saying
20:05 - this music my hand terrible I didn't
20:09 - wash my hands in a second if I am saying
20:13 - now I plus frame count modulus for the
20:19 - modulus operation is like division but
20:22 - not like division it's the remainder of
20:24 - division so if I say for example three
20:27 - modulus for three modulus for is the 3/4
20:33 - is zero remainder 1 4 divided by 4 is 1
20:39 - remainder 0 5 divided by 4 oh sorry 0
20:44 - divided by 3 sorry 3/4 at is 0 remainder
20:49 - 3 5 modulus 4 is 1 remainder 1 6 divided
20:58 - by 4 is 1 remainder 2 so what the
21:02 - modulus operation does is it cycles
21:04 - everything back between to keep
21:06 - everything within the original range of
21:08 - the array boy I got a reaiiy this video
21:11 - was going so well till I went off and
21:13 - did this but hopefully you found this
21:14 - interesting I'm gonna publish the code
21:17 - with this as I upload this video and I
21:19 - hope that you guys will make some
21:20 - experiments with this particular idea
21:22 - and share them so I can see what you
21:25 - made ok I'm gonna hit stop I got a I got
21:29 - to come back to that that you know
21:30 - something I should just do this again
21:33 - I'll make more sense but I do
