00:00 - Hello, welcome to another genetic
algorithms' video.. boy I seem to be making
00:03 - a lot of these genetic
algorithm's videos recently
00:06 - this is.. in this video I'm going to
explore something called interactive
00:10 - selection.
00:11 - The idea is a lot of ideas behind
interactive selection pioneered by Karl
00:15 - Sims, here is a reference to an artwork a
project created in 1997 the museum
00:21 - exhibit. You can look kind of here at
this image and what you see in this
00:25 - image are a lot of screens and these
screens are displaying images and then
00:30 - you see along the floor here all these
sensors. So a viewer at this museum
00:35 - exhibit would come and stand in front of
an image and when the viewer is standing
00:38 - in front of the image and looking at the image
00:40 - they're standing on the sens.. sensor and
some type of counter some type of
00:43 - algorithmic system is keeping track of
how long the viewer is standing on top
00:49 - of that sensor.
00:50 - Why is all this happening? Ok so I've said
before when I've talked about using a genetic
00:55 - algorithm in a project I've said there
are two main things that are really up
00:58 - to you to design that your sort creative
input into what's going to happen in
01:02 - your project, one is this idea of a
genotype vs phenotype which is also a
01:08 - really sort of key factor in the
Karl Sims project that I'm showing to you
01:12 - and the thing that I'm going to
demonstrate and make for you as well
01:16 - but really what am talking about right
now is this fitness function.
01:19 - The reason why I've come over here on
the whiteboard to kind of write that
01:22 - down is usually the next stop from here is
01:24 - what is the math formula for the fitness?
Well it's you know inverse distance
01:28 - squared divided by the amount of time it
took to do this and the blah blah blah blah
01:33 - you're coming up with some kind of
number of characters correct blah blah..
01:36 - some type of actual mathematical function.
Well in this case there is nothing other
01:41 - than the amount of time of a viewer spent
looking at a particular image
01:46 - so in this case it's the behavior of the
visitor to the exhibit that is driving
01:51 - the fitness function and you can think
of this as a lot of other ways you can
01:54 - have a rating system
01:55 - you know the fitness of a particular
piece of music is the amount of star
01:59 - ratings it got on some you know music
sharing web service type of thing so
02:03 - user input into the fitness user driven
design, right?
02:08 - You could be saying I want to design a
particular a pattern for a dress but
02:14 - instead of hand making that design I'm
going to just have a program
02:17 - algorithmically generated 
hundred designs
02:20 - I'm going to look at them pick the ones
I like and generate a hundred new designs.
02:23 - So you could evolve where you are
essentially the designer assigning
02:27 - fitness of the things in the
evolutionary system and that's what's
02:30 - happening here in this particular
exhibit.
02:33 - So how would you do that? But, this is
really all I have to say this video is
02:36 - really more about this idea and actually
this.. it becomes there's so many
02:39 - possibilities; do I write a web application
or do I create something with computer
02:42 - vision and perhaps I can explore, if you
have some suggestions, some particular
02:46 - scenarios but I have for you just to
look at some code and see an example
02:49 - happening
02:50 - I have perhaps what might be the lamest
version of interactive selection ever
02:54 - and I'm going to show you this example
and talk you through the code a little
02:57 - bit.
02:58 - So this is the example right here and
what it has that you can see if i zoom
03:01 - in here is a bunch of different designs
for faces and as you can see as I hover
03:06 - my mouse over them
03:08 - I'm incrementing a number. So i'm saying
here like this I really really like this
03:12 - particular face design
03:14 - so I have these designs, I have about I
think there's ten of them, here; one two
03:17 - three four five six seven eight nine ten
and I've given them all a rating and
03:20 - then I have a button here that i can
press evolve next generation and I
03:24 - click that button and you can see I now
have a new generation of designs from
03:27 - the ones that got a high rating and I can say
you know what I love purple
03:30 - let's give this one a high rating but
the size of this one is pretty good
03:34 - let's hit evolve and you can see I've got 
a lot of purple ones now
03:37 - so again and I could keep hitting evolve
and you can see there's some mutation at
03:41 - play and things happening
03:42 - I'm not suggesting to you that there's
anything particularly revolutionary
03:46 - about this but it is showing you
the basic
03:49 - mechanics of this system so let me.. let me..
let's.. let's.. let's think about how
03:54 - this works
03:55 - number one is I'm using some form of
interaction like a roll over to
03:59 - increment the fitness value for a
particular face and then uh and and then
04:04 - then I also have this idea of a
design so there's also this question
04:08 - here of... [laughs] there was nothing
written there.
04:12 - There's also this question here of
genotype vs phenotype
04:15 - so in Karl Sims' example, if you read the
paper that I have linked in this video's
04:19 - description,
04:20 - there's an elaborate discussion of how
the images in the exhibition are created
04:24 - out of these kind of like mathematical
formula sequences written in a
04:27 - programming language Lisp and all sorts
of craziness like that but what I'm
04:31 - actually doing in my particular example
which is quite a technique that you
04:34 - can apply is I actually have a a DNA the
DNA is actually just a sequence of
04:40 - floating-point numbers and each floating
point number is between 0 and 1 so that
04:47 - is the signature for the design and if I
go you can see we have this idea of
04:53 - genotype and phenotype if I look at the
code very briefly in dna.js you
05:01 - can see this is the genotype right here
this is the data; an array of genes
05:06 - everything with a random number between
0 and 1 and then the expression of that
05:11 - data is in the face object and the face
object right here you can see that
05:16 - expression happening here
05:18 - so this face object has a lot of parts
of its design. It has a size.. a radius
05:24 - an eye x and y position, the size
of the eyes, an eye color, a mouth color
05:28 - the mouth position, the mouth width, the
mouth height and all of those things are
05:32 - taking these numbers between 0 and 1 and
mapping them into some other range like a
05:35 - color between 0 and 255 or a position
between 25 and 60 that type of thing.
05:40 - So this is a one way of taking this idea
of data and then mapping it to a bunch
05:44 - of variables which then draw this kind
of ridiculous design of a face with a
05:49 - couple rectangles
05:50 - so I think that you as a person watching
this video probably could come up with a
05:54 - much more creative or beautiful or
interesting type of design
05:57 - perhaps you can think of it as like a
vector-based shape of paths
06:00 - or you could think of other ways of
encoding your design
06:03 - maybe it's a piece of music so it's
not actually even a visual design it's a
06:07 - sequence of notes and rhythms
06:09 - but whatever that is then you just need
a rating system and in this case I just have
06:13 - this rollover function that
whenever the user is rolling over that
06:18 - particular object the fitness is going
up by some small amount pretty arbitrary
06:23 - but you could have a drop down menu to
assign rating but one of the things I
06:27 - think is kind of key to realize about
this kind of system so if I go back to
06:32 - show you just really really briefly if I
would go back to this Shakespeare
06:39 - example, right?
06:40 - The Shakespeare example look at this
in the time I talked there
06:43 - I evolved a hundred seventy five
generations
06:45 - each population having 200 elements. Let
me run this example for you again
06:50 - and there's ten elements in the
population and I'm clicking around
06:54 - oh and I'm gonna have to.. I've got to actually
rate some and I got eight generations
06:57 - with 10 elements
06:58 - so the scale here is a bit of a problem
while with this kind of numeric fitness
07:01 - function of mathematical calculation I
could just be churning churning out
07:05 - generation after generation after
generation after generation over and
07:08 - over again but here I've got a look at
it, I've got to evaluate it, I've got to think
07:10 - about it, I've got to roll over it then I've got to
click the button so scale is an issue but
07:14 - one thing you might think about is the
web
07:16 - the network a distributed network of
viewers.. could you create some type of system
07:20 - maybe you could have a website
07:22 - by the way that has a different design,
this is kind of an awful idea,
07:26 - but you know you have a website where
you want somebody to buy something or
07:29 - think of something besides buy, you just
want someone to download a nice flower
07:33 - image because that's going to make the
world a better place
07:35 - what if you showed a different design
each time somebody came to the website
07:40 - and the sort of rating of that design
was how likely whether or not that
07:44 - person got to sort of some end result of
using the website. You can think of this as
07:48 - it kind's of ties into this idea of reinforcement
learning but you could evolve a
07:52 - particular design through users kind of
unconscious behavior of just kind of
07:56 - using a particular website whether it's
intuitive or not or playing a game.
08:00 - There's lots of possibilities besides
just rating but the point is if you have
08:03 - something up on the web you can have a
lot of people rating and evolving all
08:06 - at the same time with like a centralized
database.
08:08 - Anyway I'm rambling on and on and on
in this video and you could find this code
08:12 - link to in the description of the video
I hope that you maybe try to make your
08:15 - own evolutionary design system with
interactive selection and share
08:20 - it with me
08:20 - and so we can see what kind of new and
creative ideas and maybe if you share
08:24 - some with me I'll come back and make a
video where I show some of them so that
08:26 - you guys can see what other people have
been making. Ok see you soon in another
08:29 - video soon. I've got one more genetic
algorithm video at least coming
08:33 - in the pipeline here that'll be after
this one in the playlist.
08:36 - Ok, goodbye.
