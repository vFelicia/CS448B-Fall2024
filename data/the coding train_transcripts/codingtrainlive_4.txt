04:39 - good afternoon everyone uh check one two
04:42 - i am
04:42 - just testing my mic let me know if you
04:45 - can hear me okay i do have the music
04:47 - volume up a little higher than i usually
04:49 - do
04:50 - so you can confirm for me whether it's a
04:52 - little too loud
04:54 - and i'll be starting in approximately
04:55 - one minute
05:22 - do
05:31 - [Music]
05:36 - so
05:39 - [Music]
05:50 - do
05:52 - [Music]
06:31 - hello happy saturday it's the coding
06:33 - trade again
06:34 - here we are every saturday even when i
06:36 - said i don't know when this was
06:39 - was it it was definitely at the start of
06:41 - january i think if not earlier
06:44 - if i would no longer be live streaming
06:45 - on the weekends because the weekends is
06:48 - not a convenient time for me to live
06:49 - stream and yet here we are again
06:51 - another saturday afternoon i am live
06:52 - streaming it turns out
06:54 - it's not exactly a convenient time but
06:56 - it is more convenient
06:58 - than the other times during the week
06:59 - that i thought might work out someday
07:01 - this will all change
07:03 - but for now i am here on saturdays
07:05 - actually just to get this out of the way
07:06 - the schedule is going to be quite
07:07 - light for the next couple months in
07:10 - terms of live streams there's a lot of
07:12 - new content coming out on the channel so
07:14 - you will get your fill of coding train
07:16 - without a doubt if you're interested in
07:18 - that but in terms of the live streams
07:20 - just to let you know
07:21 - um i will be live streaming next weekend
07:23 - most likely but that's like 50 50.
07:27 - then i will 100 definitely be live
07:29 - streaming put this in your calendar on
07:31 - march
07:31 - 19th that's not 100 actually let's put
07:34 - that at like 90 to 95 percent i have a
07:36 - guest coming and i will soon
07:38 - put that as an event on the youtube
07:41 - calendar of events because a youtube
07:43 - calendar event no
07:44 - but i will make it a scheduled live
07:47 - stream on the channel so it will appear
07:48 - on
07:49 - the youtube coding train home page on
07:51 - youtube and then
07:52 - i am going to be out of town not
07:55 - actually not really out of town i'm
07:56 - still going to be in new york but i will
07:58 - not be
07:59 - in brooklyn for a few weeks so
08:02 - there won't be unless something changes
08:04 - and i find some miraculous way with a
08:06 - good internet connection to live stream
08:07 - during that time
08:08 - i will there will be no streams between
08:11 - approximately
08:12 - march 20th and april 10th
08:15 - um so uh so there will be a bit of a
08:18 - lull there but
08:18 - lots of new content and uh you probably
08:21 - are aware i want to say hi to
08:22 - folks in the chat and see what's going
08:25 - on here
08:26 - but you're probably aware the focus
08:27 - right now of the coding train
08:29 - is most definitely on um
08:32 - nature of co tutorial so if you've just
08:35 - if you
08:36 - haven't been around in a while you're
08:38 - tuning in maybe for the first time
08:40 - ever or after a while and you haven't
08:42 - been following what's been going on the
08:43 - channel
08:43 - if you go to the codingtrain.com
08:46 - learning
08:47 - nature of code and uh you'll see this
08:49 - playlist of videos
08:51 - all of which were completed uh
08:54 - a year ago in the spring of 2020 then i
08:57 - had i don't know if you know a family
08:58 - know about what happened in the year
09:00 - 2020
09:00 - a lot let me just say uh kind of lost
09:04 - steam with this project but i have
09:05 - firmly returned to it here
09:07 - in 2021 and all of the chapter
09:11 - 3 videos have been completed and
09:14 - published
09:15 - and guess what all of the chapter 4
09:18 - videos which is only four videos
09:20 - four videos for chapter four four being
09:22 - the only number in the english language
09:25 - that has the length is the number of
09:29 - letters in the word of the number itself
09:31 - did you know that interesting facts
09:32 - by the way i kind of want to just
09:33 - completely change the coding train to
09:35 - a channel called facts about numbers
09:38 - i i've been sending these emails to my
09:41 - nyu course and i try to include a little
09:43 - like tidbit about like a number in them
09:46 - and then i realized like oh i love this
09:48 - so much maybe i should go through
09:50 - my random number book and just uh uh
09:53 - just completely pivot the content is
09:55 - just me
09:56 - it's asmr facts about numbers uh reading
09:59 - on the coding train
10:00 - anyway i was saying chapter four uh
10:03 - particle systems four new videos they've
10:04 - all been recorded
10:06 - it may take a little while for them to
10:07 - be publicly available on the channel
10:09 - this is my
10:10 - small little plug that if you would like
10:12 - a sort of sneak preview of those
10:13 - as they're in process so rough drafts
10:16 - and early versions i will
10:18 - share with members of the coding train
10:20 - in the coding train discord now the
10:22 - coding terrain discord which i will
10:24 - press this button
10:25 - is uh hopefully it just appeared in the
10:27 - chat
10:30 - it's available to everyone i encourage
10:31 - you to join we have a lot of new
10:33 - moderators shout out and thank you to
10:35 - the new moderators
10:37 - um it's a place where hopefully it's
10:39 - welcoming and
10:40 - friendly a family-friendly place where
10:42 - you can get um help with your code
10:44 - there's a lot of different help channels
10:45 - i could show you these things right now
10:47 - but i'm just going to talk
10:49 - um certainly if you're running into any
10:52 - issues on the discord and you have ideas
10:54 - for things that you think we could do to
10:55 - improve
10:56 - it and by improve it i mean improve the
10:58 - sort of community vibe
11:00 - the inclusive nature what i hope and
11:02 - want for that discord
11:03 - um please definitely like reach out to
11:05 - the moderation team
11:07 - um um
11:10 - yeah so um pratyush roy in the chat is
11:13 - asking
11:14 - um that you're not on discord because
11:16 - you are under 13.
11:18 - when you turn 13 please join absolutely
11:21 - so i believe that the discord
11:23 - this is uh you know out of my hands so
11:25 - to speak um although
11:27 - well um but the the um terms of service
11:30 - or discord are
11:31 - um you have to be 13 or older okay
11:34 - um what am i looking at the chat so
11:36 - what's the deal with these live streams
11:38 - if these are
11:40 - sequence tutorial videos that appear on
11:43 - the coding train
11:44 - why am i here i don't know actually
11:48 - i've kind of lost track of what the
11:50 - whole
11:51 - thing with the coding train is why i'm
11:53 - here oh the uh i was plugged
11:56 - i don't know you tell me why am i here
11:59 - well i would like to engage and connect
12:01 - with the community to some small extent
12:03 - by the way
12:04 - i have a little bit of a problem i've
12:06 - been kind of obsessively
12:08 - on clubhouse which is an audio only on
12:11 - social network
12:12 - i think it's only ios only which is kind
12:14 - of ridiculous but i assume that's just
12:15 - because i haven't had the time to
12:15 - develop it for other platforms yet
12:17 - but i own clubhouse
12:20 - about a half an hour ago now it's at 12
12:23 - 40 p.m eastern
12:24 - i started a room that said pre-coding
12:27 - train live stream chat
12:28 - because i was up here like plugging in
12:29 - things i thought anybody wants to come
12:31 - in ask a question offer a suggestion
12:32 - for the coding trains live stream maybe
12:35 - they'll uh pop in on clubhouse and say
12:37 - hello nobody joined not one person
12:39 - joined
12:40 - it sat there empty with just me for like
12:42 - five to ten minutes
12:43 - and then i very very sheepishly
12:47 - coward and clicked the leave quietly
12:49 - button i left
12:50 - my own room that i had started and sat
12:53 - in by myself for five
12:54 - minutes ten minutes quietly so anyway if
12:56 - um um
12:59 - um and kobe is um is uh offering some
13:02 - information in the chat about how to
13:04 - join um if you um once you reached a
13:06 - certain birthday okay
13:08 - so um
13:12 - i forgot the other thing so so what do i
13:15 - want to
13:16 - um oh and simon is pointing out that it
13:19 - is
13:20 - invite only ios only audio only yeah so
13:24 - you do need an invite
13:25 - you know if you want an invite i got a
13:27 - lot of invites such a clubhouse invite
13:30 - okay actually if you get a clubhouse
13:32 - invite from me it permanently
13:34 - says forever nominated by
13:37 - daniel schiffman so
13:41 - um that's probably why no enjoy i have
13:44 - invites
13:45 - okay okay okay uh anyway i thought
13:49 - you know i try to do i would like to do
13:50 - some more sort of like q a style stuff
13:52 - obviously i could do that on youtube
13:54 - itself
13:55 - um i could also we have a whole discord
14:00 - which has
14:00 - probably all the capabilities if not
14:02 - more of what clubhouse has but
14:04 - i the reason why i kind of got a little
14:06 - bit addicted to it is
14:08 - um there's a couple podcasts that i
14:09 - listened to that i'm a fan of and they
14:11 - were just having discussion rooms and i
14:13 - was joining them and
14:14 - like really excited and then there were
14:16 - some a lot of you know
14:17 - it's sort of like nft and crypto
14:19 - discussion all the time and i know
14:20 - nothing about that
14:21 - i mean part of me in a very very sort of
14:23 - like
14:24 - crude and uh selfish way sees the nft
14:28 - stuff and just starts to think oh
14:30 - could i sell like you know little like
14:32 - clips of coding train videos as
14:33 - nfts and then i'm like what is wrong
14:37 - with me and my like
14:38 - capitalist urges but um it's sort of
14:40 - interesting to follow at least what's
14:42 - happening in the art world and
14:44 - collecting our digital art in particular
14:46 - and nfcs and i know
14:47 - nothing about it so if you um
14:51 - if you know stuff about that want to
14:52 - come into the tony train discord and
14:54 - educate me i would love to hear
14:56 - all right so as now i think i've
14:58 - answered my own question why am i live
15:00 - streaming
15:01 - just to be here ramble talk engage with
15:04 - the community
15:04 - and work on tutorial adjacent
15:09 - projects um hopefully work on like
15:11 - nonsensical
15:12 - useless projects i actually let me just
15:14 - mention something speaking of clubhouse
15:16 - i wasn't gonna do this
15:18 - but now it's all connected let me go to
15:20 - um i should put this in a github repo
15:22 - so one of the podcasts that i listen to
15:25 - is called
15:26 - um i know you don't know
15:31 - i-d-y-d-k and to be honest i don't
15:33 - listen to every episode
15:34 - because it's about a television show
15:36 - called psych and i haven't watched the
15:38 - show yet
15:39 - and i keep thinking i'll watch it
15:40 - eventually and then listen to the
15:41 - episodes
15:42 - but i um uh the hosts were i have a sort
15:45 - of fun game that they play i guess in
15:47 - the tv show
15:47 - psych let me see if i can find this um
15:52 - you can start to see where i'm going
15:54 - with this um the tv show psych i believe
15:56 - there is a hidden pineapple in every
15:58 - episode
16:00 - and um they have a discussion
16:04 - on the show about uh on the on
16:08 - the podcast about where is the pineapple
16:10 - how pineapply-ish
16:12 - is that particular image
16:15 - so i built a system using you know my
16:18 - knowledge
16:19 - i'm trying to use my knowledge of coding
16:21 - and algorithms of machine learning
16:23 - to make a difference in the world people
16:24 - and i thought what else could i possibly
16:27 - do to make a difference
16:28 - than make a pineapple detection web page
16:32 - system
16:33 - for a uh probably a podcast hopefully
16:35 - they're gonna have like a huge they're
16:37 - gonna get the coding train bump now and
16:38 - have thousands of listeners
16:40 - but they're a new podcast i'm assuming
16:41 - it's a small niche
16:43 - group you know i'm a niche this is a
16:45 - niche youtube channel i have all these
16:46 - subscribers but no one really watches
16:48 - the videos
16:50 - it's very interesting to me i mean lots
16:52 - of people do watch the videos don't get
16:53 - me wrong but just
16:54 - um um
16:57 - but uh i forgot what i was talking about
17:00 - anyway so i worked on this i'm gonna
17:01 - show it to you because maybe i can turn
17:02 - this into a github repo and take
17:04 - contributions for it i'll just go to
17:06 - this one
17:06 - which i think is the webcam version of
17:08 - it um you can see that i um
17:11 - did a lot of work with my web my web
17:13 - design skills
17:15 - to build this amazing website um
17:18 - uh are there psych fans i i hear by the
17:20 - way if you're a psych fan
17:22 - you're called a psycho right that's like
17:25 - you know like if you're a fan
17:26 - of is there a name for a coding train
17:29 - fan by the way like i guess you're a
17:32 - passenger no that's that's not i don't
17:33 - know you're a you're a choo choo ian
17:36 - oh and tarantu has just joined
17:41 - tarantu welcome to
17:44 - being you could be the one terence
17:47 - right now you could decide what is
17:51 - the name that fans of the coding train
17:54 - call themselves
17:56 - but i've got to reveal that i'm wearing
17:59 - sweatpants
18:02 - to get my random number book because um
18:05 - i most distinctly by the way i'm
18:06 - quite quite pineapple-ish if i don't say
18:09 - so myself
18:10 - uh terence your random number please
18:12 - write this down there's absolutely no
18:13 - other way we could ever possibly
18:15 - remember this
18:15 - ever like no computers or databases or
18:20 - anything near us that could possibly
18:21 - keep track of of random numbers assigned
18:23 - to viewers but your random number is
18:26 - on page 209 which is probably the page
18:28 - that i give everybody's random number
18:29 - which is what it opens to
18:31 - um and austin is saying it looks like a
18:34 - late 90s page yes
18:35 - that's the vibe i was going for um
18:40 - uh your random number on page 209
18:43 - uh line 10 445
18:46 - 35 086 that is your
18:50 - random number so um what i did with this
18:53 - a particular
18:55 - this is a teachable machine trained
18:56 - model a pineapple is actually
18:58 - one of the categories in mobilenet
19:01 - there's 1 000 labels in the mobilenet
19:03 - machine learning
19:04 - image classification model that i use in
19:06 - a lot of coding tutorials and examples
19:08 - but using mobilenet on its own it wasn't
19:10 - really picking up
19:11 - pineapples unless they were you know
19:13 - prominently obviously a pineapple like
19:15 - right in front of the camera so i kind
19:17 - of trained my own model using
19:19 - uh images from um of pineapples as well
19:22 - as
19:23 - screenshots from the television show
19:25 - psych with pineapples placed in them
19:28 - like overlaid i wrote a processing
19:30 - sketch that loads
19:32 - snapshots of psychedel puts pineapples
19:36 - in them
19:36 - made date about i should just be doing
19:38 - this during my livestream it's such a
19:39 - fun project
19:40 - little did you know this is what i'm
19:41 - spending my evenings doing
19:43 - um and uh then took screenshots from the
19:47 - show that didn't have pineapples in them
19:49 - trained a model and now
19:50 - um we can see i know this was one of the
19:52 - things i was using to test
19:54 - fans karn is suggesting that fans of the
19:57 - coding train
19:58 - are unicorns or rainbows that could work
20:02 - um people in the chat i are saying
20:04 - please say my name and i really
20:06 - appreciate your enthusiasm and desire
20:08 - and i don't mind just like
20:09 - every once in a while reading one of
20:11 - them or maybe i shouldn't even say that
20:12 - but i would like to discourage people
20:13 - from asking that a chat sort of fills up
20:15 - the chat with a lot of extraneous
20:17 - messages and i will pull out
20:19 - and reference so you're more likely to
20:21 - have me say your name
20:22 - if i if you post a uh a wonderful little
20:26 - quip
20:26 - or suggestion or chat message there so
20:29 - let's try i know that it really like
20:31 - basically learned
20:32 - that yellow the pineapples are yellow
20:34 - you can see that i've made a
20:36 - yellow detector um i wonder if i just
20:39 - like take my hat off
20:41 - um how you know i've got a
20:44 - mushroom here oh come on
20:48 - can you hear that
20:51 - this is my new sound effect um yeah so
20:53 - anyway um
20:55 - i don't know that i should um do this
20:58 - right now maybe one of the
20:59 - um coding trade mods or
21:03 - github managers people i'm like making
21:05 - up titles for people
21:07 - but if you have access to make a new
21:09 - coding train repo
21:10 - i'll put this sketch into and actually
21:12 - the one
21:14 - the one that i probably should start
21:16 - with is not the webcam one
21:17 - this is meant to be used although
21:18 - there's no reason why i couldn't have it
21:20 - do both
21:21 - um pineapple
21:27 - uh pineapple detection system this is it
21:31 - yeah this is the one where you can drag
21:32 - and drop an image
21:34 - so if i were to look for an image
21:38 - let's actually look for a screenshot
21:40 - from psych
21:42 - um
21:46 - like uh let's use this
21:49 - this is this is this is definitely that
21:52 - um
21:52 - i'm using my time my live stream very
21:55 - wisely here
21:56 - we're gonna get to all sorts of
21:58 - productive important projects
22:00 - let's just uh let's let's confirm
22:04 - which i put on the desktop yeah let's
22:06 - drag this image in
22:07 - and we've got yes see no pineapple in
22:10 - that image
22:12 - now if i were to take that image
22:17 - and i were to then
22:22 - oh that's such a small little image and
22:24 - then i were to look for a pineapple
22:30 - and like
22:34 - paste it in and make it small
22:39 - like he's got pineapples on his shirt
22:42 - now okay
22:43 - i'm saving this let's see how this
22:46 - changes it
22:48 - let's see if my model works the way i
22:50 - expect
22:51 - point two two percent pineapple there we
22:53 - go 62
22:54 - pineapple
22:59 - this is how i've been spending my time
23:01 - the thing is though i think
23:03 - i don't know how this is where i ended
23:04 - up in my life but i do get paid
23:06 - to teach actual college courses on this
23:09 - stuff and i i was working on this for
23:11 - the most part
23:12 - as a way to um
23:15 - um then i hope that this will be an
23:18 - example for my course in the fall
23:20 - it'll be fun you know the students will
23:22 - enjoy it they'll think i'm their
23:23 - really cool professor teacher person
23:27 - thing all right
23:31 - enough about pineapple ai please uh
23:34 - you just go to twitter twitter uh
23:37 - hashtag
23:38 - pioneer oh it's i forgot to say it's not
23:40 - pineapple ai it's
23:41 - um like if i go to twitter and go to uh
23:44 - hashtag
23:46 - uh pine a i pull its name is pineapple
23:51 - and i really actually just want to make
23:52 - a twitter bot
23:53 - that you can oh there we go good work
23:55 - everybody let's just show your
24:00 - please hold
24:06 - [Music]
24:22 - all right
24:24 - [Music]
24:28 - i broke my own rule which is not to be
24:30 - logged into my actual twitter account
24:32 - on a live stream but that's okay
24:33 - everything's okay
24:35 - uh you know it's just another day where
24:38 - nazi is trending on twitter thank you
24:40 - very much
24:42 - never opening up that trash website
24:45 - again
24:46 - oh my god all right back
24:50 - to back to today so let me actually try
24:53 - to
24:53 - um get um
24:57 - a little bit of a coding rail
25:01 - fan a rail fan is a fan of a train says
25:05 - arnov
25:06 - and profimesh is pointing out that my um
25:09 - green screen is 99 playable oh and david
25:12 - is a big fan of psych so david please oh
25:15 - yeah you can participate in this with me
25:16 - excellent
25:17 - uh the worlds can collide the
25:20 - uh weird entertainment podcasting world
25:22 - that i like to just listen in on from
25:24 - time to time
25:25 - um i have a whole other ai project that
25:28 - actually has quite uh
25:29 - not a large audience but a slightly
25:31 - larger audience than the pineapple ai
25:33 - that i'll bring to the coding train
25:34 - someday is there anybody here still
25:36 - watching
25:37 - no good we're we're uh this is a uh oh
25:40 - my goodness and guess who forgot
25:42 - to uh say thank you uh today's sponsor
25:45 - um brilliant uh brilliant is a wonderful
25:49 - a website where if you would like to
25:51 - learn
25:52 - in an interactive way everything you
25:55 - need to make a pineapple ai
25:57 - you actually could because they have a
25:58 - whole set of interactive courses
26:01 - that are step-by-step um quizzes
26:04 - and learning modules um that you can
26:06 - learn a whole variety of topics
26:08 - almost all of which are connected to
26:09 - things that they do here on the coding
26:11 - drain math and science and physics and
26:13 - coding and geometry and ai
26:15 - you can go to brilliant.org codingtrain
26:17 - you can actually sign up for free just
26:18 - signing up for free from that link
26:20 - shows them that you found it from me but
26:22 - if you want to unlock
26:23 - everything all the courses and
26:24 - everything at brilliant uh the first 200
26:26 - subscribers will get 20
26:27 - off so i'll come and i'm going to look
26:28 - at a course that i'm doing right now
26:30 - the course that i'm going through is one
26:31 - of the geometry ones and i'll come back
26:33 - and look at that a little bit more later
26:36 - um all right
26:40 - all right so one the one the first thing
26:42 - on my list today
26:43 - and this can be this is which is really
26:45 - important and maybe what i will do is
26:47 - just go to my rainbow topics
26:50 - um
26:52 - is that i have uh traditionally
26:56 - for however many years now maybe two or
26:58 - three
26:59 - um made a video a coding challenge for
27:04 - pi day
27:05 - and some of these maybe i've already
27:08 - done
27:09 - some of them maybe i didn't but i sort
27:10 - of i've kind of exhausted a lot of the
27:12 - things that i know about that kind of
27:13 - maybe would make sense for pi day
27:16 - um and it's also it comes at a bad time
27:19 - for me
27:20 - because ultimately you know if we're
27:22 - like pi day were in june although i
27:24 - guess i could do tau day
27:25 - and then i wasn't teaching and i had
27:27 - more time to like work on
27:29 - sort of speculative other topic videos
27:32 - but i don't want to let it go without a
27:33 - video this year
27:34 - and it there could be something actually
27:36 - quite relevant to
27:38 - um that comes out of like some of these
27:40 - recent videos that i've been doing about
27:42 - polar coordinates and simple harmonic
27:44 - motion and all that stuff
27:46 - but here i am it is just time
27:50 - for me to um
27:55 - and pratyush is saying that pineapple is
27:57 - my favorite fruit i actually don't
27:58 - really like refined up all that much
28:00 - let's see if anybody can guess my
28:01 - favorite fruit i'm not sure i really
28:02 - know what my favorite fruit is
28:04 - but if if we go back to the fruit that i
28:07 - used to always eat as a child
28:09 - there's a there's a famous story in my
28:10 - family
28:12 - i famously refused to eat at fast food
28:14 - restaurants was a child
28:16 - and uh um ate a bag of plums
28:20 - oh i just gave it away but i hate a bag
28:23 - of plums
28:24 - instead of the like and my family did
28:26 - not go to fast food restaurants very
28:28 - often but it was like on some sort of
28:29 - trip or something and everybody got
28:30 - horrible food poisoning and sick but not
28:32 - me because i only ate the plums
28:35 - um mango is a good one and also love the
28:38 - blueberry oh
28:39 - the blueberry is a wonderful fruit but
28:42 - yeah
28:42 - now you've all guessed plums because i
28:44 - already said although i don't know maybe
28:45 - um oh and austin tal day austin i
28:47 - haven't seen you
28:48 - in a while uh welcome back austin
28:51 - or maybe you've been around all this
28:52 - time and i just haven't noticed your
28:53 - name recently all right
28:56 - um
28:58 - so i need some ideas for pi day so this
29:00 - is a i don't i don't know how well this
29:01 - is going to work but
29:02 - um put them in the chat i'm going to um
29:05 - let's look for things that i've done
29:06 - already pi day coding train
29:10 - if i do this um so i did
29:14 - oh i did a version of a video based on
29:18 - three blue one browns
29:20 - um three blue one browns
29:25 - um video about the clacking
29:28 - what else to call it right now sorry i'm
29:29 - seeing a chat mask how about calculating
29:31 - pi the archimedean way one polygon
29:33 - touching a circle from
29:34 - inside another from the outside and the
29:36 - average length approaches the real
29:38 - circumference as they get more edges
29:40 - interesting i like this idea i did the
29:42 - first pi day challenge that i did was
29:44 - this one
29:45 - which is approximating
29:48 - um the value of pi with the dart
29:51 - throwing method what is the
29:53 - i'm not gonna be able to say this and i
29:54 - i do know this is just like not
29:56 - i mean i'm i'm familiar with this
30:00 - um it's just not fresh in my memory and
30:02 - i'm sure i spelled it archimedes way
30:04 - um finding pi by archimedes method
30:07 - official website approximating pi
30:09 - all right let's look at this you know
30:12 - what
30:14 - guess what everybody 13w net new york is
30:17 - my local station
30:19 - thank you very much not that i have any
30:22 - way of watching it
30:23 - but it is my local station okay around
30:26 - 250 bc up
30:27 - i have to sneeze okay please hold
30:36 - [Music]
30:58 - [Music]
31:16 - yes i am a very professional
31:20 - youtube host here
31:24 - who just shuts everything off to sneeze
31:26 - i had a box of kleenex the other day
31:28 - right here on the desk i don't know
31:29 - where it is
31:32 - the ratio of a circle's circumference to
31:35 - its diameter well that's the definition
31:37 - of pi
31:40 - um so could i
31:44 - launch an interactive all right let's
31:47 - see what that
31:47 - is
31:57 - ah oh the um
32:01 - uh simon is pointing out the factors in
32:04 - common the chant
32:05 - and that i i know that um it was a long
32:09 - sneeze indeed
32:10 - i know why this interactive is not
32:11 - working so there i know what a channel
32:13 - that i'm a huge
32:14 - a fan of is stand up maths
32:18 - uh pi calculate dice
32:21 - rolling i mean i don't know if this is
32:24 - yep from a thousand random numbers
32:27 - this is what i'm thinking of here hi
32:30 - i'm matt parker and for pi day this year
32:33 - i am going to generate
32:35 - 1 000 random numbers using these two
32:38 - dice the first two of which are 31 and
32:40 - 27 so 31 and 27 do not share
32:44 - a factor in common well they share one
32:47 - the most pointless of all the factors
32:49 - but we're ignoring that right so we say
32:51 - they are
32:52 - this could be good because i need one of
32:54 - the projects that i have on my list
32:55 - today
32:56 - is to digitize and i don't actually have
32:58 - to do this because it already exists
33:00 - but i want to digitize the sequence of
33:02 - random numbers that are in this book
33:04 - so that i can always use it as my random
33:06 - number generator
33:08 - so that i could certainly do and then i
33:10 - would have to write some code
33:12 - that calculates the factors of every
33:14 - number and then determines if they are
33:16 - the same i guess i could like experiment
33:18 - with this right now
33:19 - so one of the things that i can do with
33:21 - my live streams is sort of
33:23 - um tinker around with an idea
33:27 - i got a haircut you can't tell i'm just
33:29 - wearing this hat but all of a sudden
33:30 - like there's like hair all over me
33:32 - um it's probably dog hair from gloria
33:34 - but um
33:36 - what i could do is uh
33:39 - um you know how do i what's an algorithm
33:43 - algorithm
33:47 - for determining the factors of a number
33:53 - uh so like stack overflow will tell us
34:03 - oh and um abe is pointing out that
34:06 - there's a new video that just came out
34:08 - from matt parker
34:09 - which is pi y pi to the pi to the pi
34:13 - to the pi could be an integer
34:17 - huh um
34:21 - it is not random if you get it from a
34:23 - repeatable source yes but there's a
34:25 - million of them
34:27 - i don't i could do i could calculate pi
34:29 - with all one million approximately pi
34:31 - with all
34:32 - one million numbers i love this idea so
34:34 - this is interesting
34:36 - but simon is telling me to check out
34:38 - euclid's
34:40 - algorithm
34:47 - is an efficient method for um
34:51 - computing the greatest common divisor of
34:53 - two integers
34:54 - the largest number that divides them
34:56 - both without a remainder
34:58 - okay this is excellent is an example of
35:00 - an algorithm which is a step-by-step
35:01 - procedure for performing a calculation
35:03 - according to well-defined rules
35:05 - this is one of the oldest okay i'm
35:07 - loving this idea so far
35:08 - so if i were to summarize this
35:12 - what am i not logged in okay hold on
35:18 - what what is going on
35:24 - give me a second here um
35:27 - oh i don't know there's a lot of stuff
35:29 - going on in clubhouse right now i might
35:30 - need to just turn this off and go listen
35:32 - to some interesting discussions
35:36 - um
35:37 - [Music]
35:39 - please hold
35:46 - [Music]
35:55 - oh my god what kind of crazy password is
35:57 - this
35:59 - [Music]
36:05 - [Music]
36:09 - sure why not whatever don't do anything
36:12 - you tell me to do
36:29 - [Music]
36:37 - all right i am back
36:40 - uh in the coding train topics repo
36:43 - and let's make a um
36:48 - by the way i find i find github's dark
36:52 - mode
36:52 - to be a little bit too dark for my taste
36:55 - i don't know why but i feel like i can't
36:56 - read the text
36:58 - um so
37:02 - uh all right yes um now
37:06 - uh pi day 20
37:10 - 21 uh euclids
37:14 - are like
37:20 - cofactors random numbers
37:25 - use all one million
37:28 - random numbers
37:32 - so
37:35 - 500 000 pairs
37:39 - um calculate
37:43 - the um is this what i'm looking for the
37:46 - greatest common divisor
37:50 - [Music]
37:55 - this is good actually this is one of the
37:56 - things i've been helping my
37:58 - kids with in their math class they're
38:00 - learning about how to reduce
38:03 - um fractions to their simplest form
38:06 - um and then so this is a good reference
38:12 - um ah
38:15 - where did i go ah no i closed it i'm the
38:18 - worst okay
38:19 - come on local storage thank you
38:32 - okay and now um this is a very
38:36 - mathy um
38:39 - i'd have to think about what what
38:40 - visuals might go with this
38:42 - but um um what
38:46 - visuals could go with this
38:51 - but and i'm not saying i'm definitely
38:53 - going to do this but
38:55 - here is an idea so if you can actually
38:58 - right now
38:59 - first of all you can reply to this
39:00 - thread if you have some suggestions or
39:02 - comments on this one if i've gotten this
39:04 - sort of wrong
39:05 - but you can right now file any issues
39:08 - here you won't be able to add the pi day
39:10 - label but
39:11 - i or another codingtrain github.org
39:15 - member will be able to do so i'm going
39:18 - to collect um
39:19 - lists of things and probably if pi day
39:22 - is march i need to record this video
39:24 - like next week so get them in get your
39:26 - suggestions in i would say buy
39:29 - monday if you can um
39:34 - all right
39:38 - um
39:41 - let's see anybody else got anything
39:45 - um that you want to share as an idea for
39:48 - pi day before i move on
39:50 - and one of the others like pie art
40:00 - looks like the art in pie
40:05 - yeah i mean i've done videos like this
40:07 - i'm not video
40:08 - i've done examples like this this is
40:09 - really nice
40:11 - i had this idea of graphing the um the
40:14 - distribution of random numbers of
40:16 - numbers in pi
40:17 - to see like if i do the first million
40:19 - like how evenly distributed is it
40:21 - these are lovely um
40:27 - i like seeing these um great work
40:30 - whoever made this visual cinnamon um
40:34 - a pie based rose
40:44 - yeah i mean i've made videos about the
40:46 - lisa's you curve and
40:48 - rose curves and all of these would be
40:50 - great to do i mean i
40:52 - could also do a coding
40:55 - challenge on a topic like this would
40:57 - likely i'd like like i want to do one
40:58 - that i haven't done before
41:00 - that just makes use of um
41:03 - polar coordinates or trigonometry and
41:05 - the number pi
41:06 - in some way that is like a celebration
41:09 - of pi day but not really like dealing
41:11 - with the number pi
41:12 - or its sequence of digits itself that's
41:14 - also something
41:16 - i'm crashing thunder is saying i like
41:18 - the idea of finding
41:19 - sequences or interesting information in
41:21 - the digits
41:22 - but guess what that's what i did last
41:24 - year so uh peaking
41:26 - inside pi coding train i'm pretty sure
41:30 - that was the video
41:32 - um that i did last year um right around
41:34 - the time of the start of the global
41:36 - pandemic
41:37 - uh march 14th 2020 and this was based on
41:41 - i assume it'll be linked from this page
41:44 - um this was based on the fathom
41:48 - uh fathom information designs project
41:50 - peek inside pie so i
41:52 - highly recommend that you check this out
41:54 - by the way i should be doing a better
41:55 - job of this
41:56 - but links that i'm looking at in the
41:58 - live stream
41:59 - i try to post those to the coding train
42:02 - discord
42:03 - under the live category under links so
42:06 - for example
42:07 - here's one that i'm just sharing and
42:11 - here's one that i'm just sharing so if
42:12 - you want to pick up these links
42:14 - um you know this is this youtube video
42:18 - that i just shared
42:19 - um um you can
42:22 - uh grab them there but more importantly
42:26 - boy did i forget to share
42:29 - the link to my pineai apple pineapple
42:36 - what if you use the sequences to make
42:39 - the rows more
42:40 - intricate so i could do a like a
42:42 - follow-up video
42:44 - that elaborates on the the rose curve
42:48 - um and makes some interesting variations
42:50 - of it i'm definitely i'm open to that
42:52 - idea
42:53 - oops i forgot that i don't have this
42:54 - disstream chat
42:58 - oh use the pendulum
43:03 - simulation so simon is saying
43:07 - um oh i don't have this here anyway okay
43:09 - sorry i messed this up
43:10 - bear with me for a second clearing out a
43:13 - chat thing
43:14 - use the pendulum simulation to calculate
43:16 - pi the formula for the period of a
43:18 - pendulum includes pi
43:23 - i think there might be um some issues
43:26 - with that in terms of how what my
43:28 - pendulum simulation actually does
43:30 - what if i could get i have an idea
43:34 - what if i could get a physical pendulum
43:37 - use computer vision to track the
43:40 - pendulums
43:41 - the bob of the pendulum's location
43:45 - and read its period based on
43:48 - millies and its physical location from
43:51 - the
43:52 - camera and then calculate pi that way
43:54 - that's a pretty interesting idea
43:57 - i would even try that right now if i
43:59 - because i have a bunch of cameras and
44:00 - things but i don't think i have a
44:01 - pendulum anywhere i suppose i could rig
44:03 - one up
44:04 - um but i like this idea oh ash
44:08 - okay ash hello hold on a second ash
44:10 - writes i'm learning coding on white hat
44:12 - jr
44:14 - i'm very curious one of the things that
44:15 - um uh i happen to look at from time to
44:18 - time
44:19 - is uh links that peop referral links to
44:22 - like the p5.js website and other
44:24 - kind of creative coding websites that
44:25 - i'm involved with
44:27 - um and
44:31 - um white hat jr is just like a
44:35 - uh uh site that i don't know if it's a
44:38 - massive site but it just throws a lot of
44:40 - traffic to p5.js or editor.pp5 the p5
44:42 - web editor
44:43 - so i'm curious for anyone who's i don't
44:45 - know i'm not familiar with what white
44:46 - house jr
44:47 - is um but i'm curious for anybody who's
44:50 - a user of it to
44:51 - kind of let me know a little bit about
44:52 - it all right
44:55 - and uh simon is telling me that a
44:59 - i don't know why this is not working but
45:00 - i'm not going to worry about it that a
45:02 - 2.45 meter long pendulum
45:05 - will take pi seconds to complete a cycle
45:08 - so maybe i could measure exactly that
45:10 - length
45:12 - why i have like a nervous tic which is
45:14 - when i record videos or live stream
45:17 - i start to like sneeze or my nose gets
45:19 - itchy it's really like it's very strange
45:21 - remember that's a thing that happens to
45:23 - other people or it's just me
45:25 - all right i would like to share uh where
45:28 - we time-wise 1 40 p.m i would like to
45:32 - share some projects from you the
45:35 - community of viewers of the code of
45:36 - dream that you have made that you have
45:38 - put your heart and soul into or
45:39 - at least a little bit of time into you
45:41 - took the time to watch your video
45:43 - play with the code make your own version
45:45 - so submit it to the codygrade website
45:47 - and i want to say thank you to you i
45:50 - love to
45:50 - see these and use them for inspiration
45:52 - and share them with students and all
45:54 - sorts of content so
45:56 - let's move on over to codytraining.com
46:00 - i'm gonna go to the challenger page
46:06 - um and i would like to so i have two
46:10 - methods
46:10 - by which that i look at community
46:12 - contributions one
46:14 - is i spin a wheel to pick a random one i
46:16 - have a just a random number generatory
46:18 - thingy that will pick a random one
46:20 - but i often also like to just look at
46:22 - because there's not that many of them
46:24 - uh community contributions to recent
46:26 - coding challenges so lucky for you
46:28 - if you so feel so inclined if you
46:30 - recently submitted
46:31 - a project to the spring force or
46:35 - the um and thank you for that comment
46:37 - prathamesh that you're sharing with me
46:38 - now that's good for me to know i was not
46:40 - aware
46:41 - the music was quite loud see i knew the
46:43 - music was too loud
46:44 - but i guess it's just different tracks
46:46 - of different volume
46:47 - but let me turn that back down now
46:50 - [Music]
46:53 - sorry everybody too loud too loud too
46:56 - loud
46:57 - yeah sorry about that um
47:01 - okay okay okay i got it i got it why is
47:04 - that why is it that that song is so loud
47:07 - hold on it's gonna be really quiet for a
47:09 - second
47:10 - try this again
47:16 - weird now it's like gone
47:25 - [Music]
47:30 - yeah okay
47:30 - [Music]
47:33 - i just wonder if i can can i do
47:40 - [Music]
47:44 - um q volume
47:47 - 50 percent
47:54 - all right so now
48:02 - so this is at the correct volume and now
48:05 - hopefully please
48:06 - mind your ears i have set that other
48:09 - track to 50
48:10 - volume so it should be fine but there's
48:12 - a small chance
48:13 - i didn't do it correctly it's gonna be
48:14 - too loud here we go
48:20 - hopefully this is good
48:24 - all right sorry about that everybody all
48:26 - right let's look at
48:27 - um let's go to the pendulum first and
48:30 - let's take a look at some of these
48:31 - projects that people have submitted
48:33 - oh yeah this is great i'm so excited so
48:35 - i haven't seen all of these
48:36 - some of these will be new but some of
48:37 - them i have looked at already and i did
48:39 - look at this pendulum on a cart
48:41 - um project so this is super interesting
48:43 - to me
48:44 - because this is a simulation of the sort
48:47 - of pendulum
48:48 - flipped upside down and balanced on a
48:50 - cart
48:51 - and i forget if i can um
48:55 - oh yeah and it's i guess it's an
48:56 - algorithm for the cart to actually like
48:58 - balance itself but this is something
49:00 - that would be
49:02 - roger saying better yet no sound sorry i
49:05 - i have to have the sound it keeps me
49:07 - alive and full of energy it makes me
49:09 - feel like i'm not just alone in an attic
49:11 - in brooklyn new york talking to myself
49:13 - which is in many ways what i'm doing
49:15 - it's a little weird
49:19 - um what i was saying was um i've been
49:22 - looking for some examples for
49:24 - reinforcement style learning and so the
49:27 - sort of like
49:28 - cart balancing a poll type style example
49:31 - um is quite a good one and so maybe
49:34 - there's something i could do with this i
49:35 - have to admit i don't know
49:36 - too much about this particular algorithm
49:38 - it's pid
49:39 - controller um so i don't
49:42 - um like pid cart is a
49:45 - controller i don't know this terminology
49:48 - um
49:50 - but uh proportional integral derivative
49:53 - controller is a control loop mechanism
49:55 - employing feedback ah interesting i
49:57 - would love to explore this
49:59 - in a future video this would be i would
50:01 - love to be able to figure this out
50:03 - myself but
50:04 - not going to happen right now thank you
50:08 - for that wonderful contribution moving
50:11 - on i'm
50:12 - going to go to the colorful pendulum in
50:14 - codepen by andreyud
50:16 - chaka chakraborty
50:20 - there we go i love this we've got some
50:24 - nice
50:24 - um trails going a nice little beautiful
50:27 - red color picked for the pendulum
50:29 - um it'd be interesting to sort of time
50:31 - it and see if we could approximate the
50:33 - number of pi
50:35 - the number pi through this swinging
50:37 - pendulum um one thing that i was going
50:39 - to suggest for people for an exercise i
50:40 - think i might have forgotten to in the
50:41 - video
50:42 - is can you make it so that you can catch
50:43 - the pendulum and drag it around and then
50:45 - let it go
50:46 - um actually the nature of code example
50:48 - does have that code built into it
50:49 - that's something you might consider
50:50 - thank you
50:52 - i don't know why i have to press this
50:53 - thing twice every time
50:55 - why i don't think it's working correctly
51:01 - i was using it to replace this but thank
51:03 - you for this wonderful pendulum
51:04 - simulation okay
51:05 - next simple pendulum simulation using
51:08 - python
51:11 - and we've got a nice youtube video that
51:13 - is
51:14 - showing us the results here uh awesome
51:19 - this looks like that this particular
51:21 - simulation is using some real world
51:24 - measurements to simulate the path
51:27 - the oscillation of a pendulum in python
51:30 - i wonder if there is
51:32 - a code source code is linked here
51:35 - so we can see that here um on
51:38 - um on github itself
51:42 - cool whoa all right awesome um i'm not
51:45 - gonna go through this in a lot of detail
51:46 - right now but it's
51:47 - fun to see okay um
51:50 - next up we have got the up down left
51:54 - right
51:55 - by josh kenzer and this was by karen
51:58 - canary walla by the way the previous one
52:00 - up down left right
52:03 - whoa i have not seen this one yet um
52:07 - so one thing i should probably do this
52:09 - is a little bit unfortunate
52:11 - one thing that the um web editor doesn't
52:13 - do very smartly and i don't know the
52:14 - best way to handle it
52:15 - is if um if the editor is set to high
52:19 - contrast mode
52:21 - but the default sort of like text style
52:24 - is um black so it's very hard to read it
52:26 - let me just do show boxes
52:29 - so that says show boxes and show
52:31 - pendulum which is useful for me to just
52:32 - read out what it says anyway
52:36 - so i guess show pendulums is actually
52:37 - show the lines
52:39 - this is really this is this has the
52:41 - makings of a really nice
52:43 - perfect looping gif um i think there's
52:46 - that that i would really encourage you
52:48 - to think about as a way then you can nft
52:50 - it
52:51 - i don't know is that the thing i don't
52:52 - know how it works
52:54 - um i shouldn't just be so cavalier with
52:57 - my commentary
52:58 - um but uh you know bees and bombs is a
53:02 - um an artist that i'm a huge fan of who
53:04 - makes um
53:05 - among many other artists do this as well
53:07 - but makes uh um
53:09 - looping gifs out of uh simple and
53:12 - sometimes quite complex algorithms like
53:13 - this one but really nice choice of color
53:16 - and behavior in the way the pendulums
53:17 - all synchronize and meet up and create
53:19 - this
53:20 - geometric order and then separate out i
53:22 - love this quite a bit
53:24 - what does the slider do guess it's maybe
53:28 - like the speed
53:30 - or like a force oh or it's like some
53:32 - kind of alpha
53:34 - yeah oh the slider is the alpha yeah
53:38 - interesting that's pretty wild
53:43 - just to zoom in on this for a second
53:47 - that's quite beautiful the smearing of
53:48 - the color
53:51 - all right um
53:54 - bot bit just asked can you do gjk algo
53:58 - and run
53:58 - cutter which i'm probably saying
54:00 - incorrectly sometime i would i do want
54:01 - to explore those someday
54:03 - um i always just use sort of like simple
54:05 - euler integration which is a sort of
54:06 - fancy term for
54:08 - the way that i model motion in like
54:10 - p5.js animation programs and all the
54:12 - nature of code examples but i would like
54:14 - to explore some more
54:15 - sophisticated versions um
54:18 - okay now we've got a pendulum website by
54:21 - sarvogya singh
54:27 - what was that i love this little
54:29 - animation there's a little pendulum
54:30 - there my pendulums
54:31 - a simple pendulum a newton's cradle and
54:34 - a double pendulum oh this is so cool uh
54:38 - use arrow keys to make it move
54:40 - do i click on each of these oh and we
54:41 - get
54:45 - oh so i can like i can like apply a
54:48 - force to it
54:49 - with the arrow key that's pretty cool
54:54 - i love that
54:57 - i love that now let's look at the
54:58 - newton's cradle i would love this would
55:00 - be a great um
55:03 - this would be a lovely um coding
55:05 - challenge video uh see i feel like i
55:07 - want to like
55:08 - click and drag these
55:11 - press arrow key to start
55:14 - oh up whoa these are like little springy
55:16 - ones
55:18 - that's cool
55:21 - oh my god what have i done
55:28 - ah this is wild is this using um like a
55:31 - like a physics engine like mater.js or
55:34 - is this all yeah it's using matter.js
55:37 - so a matter.js is a physics engine that
55:39 - i use in
55:40 - in different examples of it previously
55:42 - but i haven't in a while
55:43 - this is great uh
55:48 - okay um let's look at the double
55:51 - pendulum
55:51 - just curious if this is a double
55:53 - pendulum also with matter.js
55:56 - can i click or is this just more um oops
55:59 - based on yeah this is also with mata.js
56:02 - cool
56:02 - wonderful thank you for sharing this
56:04 - okay
56:06 - now i know after that twice this is also
56:08 - way too quiet
56:11 - if i put it by the mic you can really
56:14 - hear it
56:17 - uh let us go now to um
56:21 - spring forces and see what we've got
56:23 - we've got
56:24 - three contributions here and i know that
56:26 - there have been other things that people
56:28 - have made i really would love for you to
56:29 - um
56:30 - submit them here because it's hard for
56:31 - me to pull up stuff from discord or
56:34 - twitter or whatever so i love for you to
56:36 - share your things that you make with me
56:38 - through
56:38 - other platforms but this is the central
56:41 - location to collect
56:42 - everything that i might look at on a
56:44 - given live stream okay
56:45 - grab any spring particle by galaton
56:51 - cool oh can i this is very similar
56:54 - visually at least to the example
56:56 - oh but i can grab any part of it oh
56:58 - that's wild so that's the change
57:01 - like i can just grab over here
57:05 - very springy so definitely some of the
57:07 - things i need to
57:08 - i should probably work on with my
57:10 - particular implementation is
57:12 - keeping things a little bit more um
57:19 - a little less chaotic uh all right thank
57:22 - you for that
57:23 - spring force contribution grasp by
57:25 - leonardo
57:30 - this one i have not seen oh cool so
57:34 - this looks like what it must be is it's
57:36 - just
57:37 - like my oh this is so oh oh
57:41 - this is really awesome so i'm just
57:42 - totally speculating here
57:44 - but i think what's being done here is
57:46 - this is literally
57:48 - my connected spring example it might not
57:50 - be
57:51 - but um
57:54 - um and so if you think about that soft
57:57 - string
57:58 - hanging down and you flipped it so that
58:01 - maybe
58:01 - this sort of like pseudo-gravity force
58:03 - is pointing upwards
58:05 - and then maybe there's like some forces
58:08 - some pearl and noise like forces pushing
58:10 - it
58:11 - left and right arbitrarily or just
58:14 - moving the top
58:15 - manually and all the sort of like
58:17 - springy connections
58:18 - are undulating and squiggling
58:22 - around and then even though this might
58:24 - be a sort of
58:25 - you know visualized in the literal way
58:27 - as like circle line
58:28 - circle line by having these strokes
58:32 - of of uh
58:35 - sequentially smaller widths um
58:38 - you really get this like seaweed
58:41 - underwater
58:42 - grass plant form like quality
58:46 - oh and abe is asking will you also take
58:48 - a look at the contributions of the noc
58:50 - series i actually wasn't planning that
58:52 - because i was thinking i'm sort of
58:53 - focused on just looking at
58:54 - the last two videos but um sure i would
58:57 - love to check out um
58:59 - particularly abbe if there was one of
59:00 - yours that you recently submitted that
59:02 - you want me to take a look at i would
59:03 - certainly
59:03 - or anybody else who's watching the chat
59:05 - that's submitted to those videos
59:06 - um please let me know
59:11 - i'm i almost don't want to look at the
59:13 - code because
59:16 - it's just so um beautiful on its own
59:18 - without even
59:19 - unpacking what's below it but i i can't
59:21 - resist
59:22 - so the grass looks like this is like
59:25 - what i did
59:26 - um with a very low k
59:30 - that seems to be something different um
59:33 - there's also a wind
59:34 - force which is new let's see and the
59:36 - wind is just
59:38 - a random amount every time that's
59:41 - interesting
59:42 - so because if the wind is small enough
59:44 - and it's random every time
59:45 - it's not going to like go crazy like
59:47 - this because it's just a little push in
59:49 - one way or the other so you randomly get
59:50 - a few pushes in one direction it'll
59:52 - start to go that way
59:53 - and it might slow back go back that's
59:54 - great um applying the force wind
59:57 - and this looks and i i think the secret
60:00 - here is just really thoughtful rendering
60:03 - um i don't know where that happens
60:06 - really thoughtful rendering
60:07 - and just clever tuning of the values and
60:11 - adding the wind obviously
60:12 - so let's look for where is the rendering
60:14 - happening i'm just curious
60:16 - uh grass update
60:20 - particle update spring show
60:24 - so that's in the show function of the
60:26 - spring and it has a stroke weight that
60:28 - stroke weight
60:29 - changes and is passed in during the loop
60:32 - ah this is such a very clever way of
60:34 - doing this so like this dot
60:36 - total minus i so if this if there's
60:39 - 10 springs the first one is
60:43 - thickness ten then nine then eight and
60:45 - seven etcetera etcetera
60:49 - um okay
60:53 - so simon has shared something for me to
60:55 - click on
60:56 - that um it was a collaboration between
60:58 - him and abe
60:59 - let me grab that real quick
61:02 - um and come back to it
61:06 - are we at break time yet yeah we're just
61:07 - about break time i gotta uh come i'm
61:09 - gonna take a break in a minute here
61:12 - whoa oh this is good it's like
61:15 - what kind of crazy insane code did you
61:18 - all write and i realized oh this is just
61:19 - the open simplex noise implementation
61:22 - okay let's run this
61:27 - lovely lovely lovely
61:31 - so we've got oscillating particles
61:33 - changes in colors
61:35 - actually something that i want to if if
61:36 - you'll end all indulge me for a second i
61:39 - want to explore something this reminds
61:40 - me of
61:41 - um so thank you for creating this um uh
61:43 - wonderful sketch
61:45 - i like how you're using a javascript
61:46 - object for like settings that's kind of
61:48 - like a cool little trick
61:49 - and i could also imagine you loading
61:50 - those from like a json file or something
61:53 - which you've got like a configuration
61:54 - for any particular visualization
61:57 - um but what i actually i if you'll all
61:59 - indulge me for a second i want to look
62:00 - at
62:01 - the video tutorial that i recorded on
62:03 - friday
62:04 - was about how to use an image texture
62:09 - in p5.js with a particle system to
62:12 - create a flame
62:13 - like effect and it was my
62:17 - expectation and let me do a dupe let me
62:19 - duplicate
62:20 - this and when i was trying to do this
62:23 - when i was recording the video itself
62:26 - that if i were to type webgl and use the
62:29 - webgl renderer i would see
62:30 - exactly the same thing
62:34 - would see exactly the same thing but
62:36 - maybe i would be able to get higher
62:38 - performance out of it
62:39 - even though this is a 2d system just to
62:42 - use the hardware acceleration
62:43 - of the webgl implementation in the
62:46 - browser itself
62:46 - when i ran this i see nothing and i see
62:49 - no error
62:50 - so i wanted to try to figure this out so
62:54 - let me just see i'm just gonna um
62:57 - comment out everything like where is the
63:01 - bug
63:08 - so first let me just draw that image
63:13 - yes so there's the image
63:16 - um and if i do sorry if i do background
63:19 - zero
63:21 - there that's the image now if i change
63:24 - this to webgl
63:27 - and i think i just figured out oh it's
63:29 - oh
63:31 - well that's a big issue oh that's
63:35 - all it is actually oh my goodness i'm
63:38 - such a
63:40 - let's say dum-dum but this is i'm not
63:43 - because this is the mistake we
63:45 - all make and forget and do i forgot
63:48 - that the um
63:52 - point of origin in web gel renderer is
63:54 - the center so what if i just
63:56 - like do something which is probably not
63:58 - the best idea but just oh like hold on
64:00 - do this
64:02 - move it back okay great there we go so
64:05 - now i think oh is this i could have
64:06 - included this in the video maybe i will
64:08 - add an addendum to it
64:10 - um let's just see if this now works
64:18 - yeah but why am i not seeing the at the
64:21 - additive blending
64:23 - so why is blend mode ad in webgl
64:27 - i must need something different
64:31 - huh oh but this is good because
64:34 - this ran super super slow
64:39 - and let me just go for a second to the
64:41 - particle
64:42 - and just put the tint back to 255
64:46 - just for a second
64:51 - so this is a smoky like effect
64:56 - and if i go back to the sketch
65:01 - um
65:05 - i'm getting some look at this later um
65:09 - [Music]
65:12 - if i go back to the sketch
65:18 - let me take out blend mode add okay
65:21 - so this ran really really slow so
65:26 - let me take out webgl
65:30 - it still looks kind of different so
65:32 - strange
65:34 - um
65:41 - um and
65:45 - let me i'm sorry i'm thinking here i'm
65:47 - also getting messages by reading
65:50 - direct messages on another platform so
65:52 - apologies for that
65:54 - um okay let's put back webgl
65:58 - no no this is what i want to do if i go
66:00 - and just comment this up
66:01 - what i wanted to look at is if i change
66:04 - emit to five
66:07 - you can see the frame rate here is now
66:11 - quite slow it's running quite
66:14 - slow oh the issue is maybe the clear
66:18 - okay i'll i'll investigate that i needed
66:20 - clear in
66:21 - with the additive blending not in webgl
66:23 - but that could be an issue
66:24 - so what i first thing i want to test is
66:30 - just
66:32 - if i add webgl here
66:35 - yeah so this is awesome super fast
66:40 - okay the webgl render is super fast now
66:44 - uh let me get oh i have the background
66:46 - on let's oh yeah
66:47 - are the clear on no that shouldn't
66:49 - matter
66:50 - uh hold on you know i want background
66:54 - let me take out clear for a second
66:56 - same thing now i'm in webgl
67:03 - you know why is it i think there's a z
67:07 - a layering issue also
67:11 - that the transparency that i have to
67:15 - consider
67:17 - yeah so this this i this i need to
67:20 - figure out like why i've got
67:22 - great performance but what's wrong with
67:26 - um what's wrong with the blending
67:29 - and i suppose
67:34 - a google search is probably not gonna
67:38 - uh 3d okay oh wait
67:42 - subtract
67:46 - so blend mode supposedly
67:49 - okay oh most of these only work no but
67:52 - these say 2d
67:56 - add should work with webgl
68:00 - according to the reference
68:04 - another thing to just make sure is that
68:06 - i am using
68:08 - yeah i'm using the newish version of p5
68:12 - so i'm gonna have to investigate this
68:13 - more later i wanted to see if there was
68:15 - like a quick
68:16 - way that i could figure this out because
68:17 - i love the performance that i'm getting
68:19 - out of this now
68:21 - um add only works for 2d
68:25 - really all right let's try one of the
68:27 - ones that specifically says
68:28 - 3d uh like subtract
68:38 - so let's add let's try subtract
68:42 - well if i'm subtracting not getting
68:44 - anything
68:45 - is the issue there we go
68:50 - interesting
68:53 - oh hold on i think i have an idea
68:57 - oh look at that that's kind of cool if
69:00 - i'm subtracting i can do it that way
69:05 - and then do i and i don't even need the
69:07 - clear clear doesn't do anything does it
69:09 - so that's pretty interesting could i
69:12 - invert this now
69:14 - like watch could i use filter
69:19 - inverse or invert
69:23 - i don't know that that works in webgl
69:27 - no it cannot uh that's
69:32 - crazy
69:35 - fascinating
69:40 - so how why
69:44 - why why why is
69:48 - add i mean ad should really work so let
69:51 - me see uh
69:52 - webgl additive blending
70:00 - no i want really just the web gel
70:20 - so i wonder if i can like sort of break
70:23 - into the lower level webgl
70:24 - code and i would say this is a bug
70:27 - probably in um p5
70:33 - yeah this to me feels like a bug but i'm
70:36 - glad to see this
70:37 - because this is pretty interesting to me
70:39 - now if
70:40 - i were to i think i can get some color
70:44 - out of this
70:46 - by going into the particle
70:54 - there we go kind of like that
71:06 - oh i forgot it's it's the opposite if
71:10 - i'm subtracting
71:18 - it's kind of interesting um
71:27 - well i'm pleased to see that i've gotten
71:30 - somewhere with this
71:31 - i think i should try to do uh
71:34 - investigate this further to see if
71:36 - there's actually a bug in p5 itself
71:39 - to me it feels like there is because how
71:42 - could
71:43 - how could add i mean broadly speaking
71:47 - forget about what p5 has chosen to
71:49 - implement
71:50 - or not um but broadly speaking
71:53 - um if you could do a kind of subtract
71:57 - blend
71:57 - in the web in in native webgl in the
72:00 - browser
72:02 - then there's no reason why the an ad
72:04 - blend wouldn't be possible
72:07 - and additive blending is also one of the
72:09 - most common techniques
72:11 - um in computer graphics in terms of
72:13 - creating fiery
72:15 - glowy-like effects that i have a feeling
72:17 - this is
72:18 - um an error um austin is telling me to
72:21 - try
72:22 - screen okay
72:29 - and i'll have to change the background
72:31 - then to zero
72:34 - oh look at that
72:39 - screen interesting
72:42 - what is screen so now
72:48 - are you telling me that
72:53 - uh
72:59 - uh what i'm losing i've lost the alpha
73:02 - though
73:04 - or is it just that my numbers are so
73:06 - high
73:08 - or do i need the clear no i have clear
73:12 - the clear shouldn't really matter
73:15 - so why am i not getting like it's at the
73:18 - fade
73:21 - why am i not getting the this i wonder
73:24 - if i should actually use the texture
73:28 - um a 1 minus a times b
73:33 - this is pretty interesting though to see
73:36 - [Music]
73:42 - i mean this is kind of a nice effect
73:43 - also but it's not exactly what i'm
73:46 - looking for
73:48 - um
73:58 - oh profit mesh is asking about the live
74:00 - captions yes so i did an experiment
74:02 - where i was getting the live captions
74:03 - from
74:04 - a different service last week and i
74:06 - really liked it and i've been working on
74:07 - trying to
74:08 - get that directly into obs and i wasn't
74:11 - able to get it to work
74:12 - yet um so for today i'm just using the
74:15 - unfortunately the automated live
74:16 - captions from youtube those should be
74:18 - enabled
74:19 - um but um and if if um anybody's
74:21 - interested in helping me with getting
74:23 - um sort of the ape some sort of api
74:26 - working between
74:28 - i would love to connect offline about
74:30 - that because i would like to be able to
74:31 - get a better captioning service
74:33 - um enable alpha for the renderer
74:37 - yeah that is often true
74:41 - um okay
74:44 - all right i'm gonna move on from this
74:46 - because um i only have till three
74:48 - o'clock
74:49 - and i do wanna get to some other things
74:51 - that i want to do today
74:52 - i also need to take a minute to tell you
74:55 - about
74:56 - today's sponsor
75:00 - can i do a drum roll for the sponsor
75:03 - well i'm pressing buttons and getting
75:04 - things set up
75:08 - brilliant
75:11 - all right what is brilliant
75:16 - this is brilliant and maybe i'm going to
75:18 - take away this for a second this is the
75:20 - brilliant website it is
75:21 - a website i would say what i want to
75:24 - show you
75:25 - it's a website wow isn't that like such
75:26 - a brilliant characterization
75:28 - it's a website which is full of
75:31 - learning potential and possibilities if
75:34 - you
75:34 - like the content that i do on the coding
75:37 - train algorithms visualizations
75:39 - math physics the number pi
75:42 - geometry infinity ai and neural networks
75:46 - programming if you like all that stuff i
75:49 - think you might
75:50 - i think you would enjoy um uh brilliant
75:54 - brilliant is uh and the thing that i'm
75:56 - really trying to do with brilliant which
75:57 - is
75:57 - new is i'm trying to think of it as
75:58 - something that i can build into my
76:01 - daily or more likely here for me the way
76:03 - my life works weekly routine
76:04 - so i've set a goal for myself to try to
76:07 - do
76:08 - a lesson from a course
76:12 - one lesson every week let me just pull
76:15 - up here i want to make sure i had some
76:17 - other notes of things that i wanted to
76:19 - sort of say um say about brilliant just
76:23 - to
76:23 - make sure that i'm hitting all the um
76:25 - important points
76:27 - um you know i think for me one of the
76:29 - things that i
76:30 - as a teacher i'm really trying to find
76:33 - ways to
76:34 - inspire the love of learning and the fun
76:37 - of learning and so
76:39 - you know sometimes sort of often
76:41 - traditional ways of learning through
76:42 - kind of tests and memorization um don't
76:45 - can really um they're really kind of a
76:48 - downer in terms of
76:50 - getting that love of learning and so for
76:52 - me um
76:53 - making video tutorials playing around
76:55 - engaging with the community is one way
76:56 - and also having uh going through
76:59 - interactive lessons which
77:00 - have forms and discussions uh and lots
77:03 - of
77:03 - clever fun uh visual ways of and written
77:06 - ways of learning things that's really
77:07 - been
77:08 - uh really increased this sort of like
77:09 - fun and the other thing is there's a lot
77:11 - of topics here that i don't explore
77:13 - um cryptocurrency is one quantum
77:15 - computing is another
77:16 - so there's if you want to join me and a
77:18 - community of eight million learners and
77:20 - educators today
77:21 - um all you have to do is go to
77:24 - brilliant.org
77:26 - codingtrain um you can sign up for free
77:28 - just through that um but you also
77:30 - to unlock everything on the website um
77:32 - the first 200 subscribers uh to do so
77:34 - through that link will get 20 off so the
77:36 - course that i was doing
77:38 - um i don't know why it's not showing up
77:39 - to me here immediately i think i was
77:42 - was it beautiful geometry continue
77:44 - course yeah this is the one that i've
77:46 - been working on i think i'm on lesson
77:47 - two
77:47 - yeah so i'm on lesson two i've done
77:49 - lesson one already
77:51 - and my goal hopefully if you see me next
77:52 - week check with me am i on to lesson
77:54 - four
77:56 - do you guys hear that car alarm going
77:57 - off by the way that's always a lovely
77:59 - thing to happen why
77:59 - welcome to new york city people um
78:03 - so let's see i'm gonna like work through
78:04 - some of these problems the other thing
78:06 - about this to be perfectly honest
78:08 - for me one of the things i like about
78:09 - brilliant is i get lots of ideas for
78:10 - coding tutorials that i want
78:12 - to make um all right so
78:15 - what fraction of this large square has
78:17 - been shaded red
78:19 - okay well i can say that it's more than
78:22 - a quarter
78:24 - right because this is a quarter right
78:26 - here
78:27 - so this is one-eighth so a quarter plus
78:30 - an
78:30 - eighth plus a sixteenth so this is some
78:32 - kind of sequence
78:34 - that i guess when it goes to infinity
78:36 - going to infinity add in
78:38 - add infinitive is latin meaning to
78:40 - infinity it's approaching
78:43 - what and so these lessons here um simon
78:47 - is telling us an avid brilliant user i
78:48 - know is telling me that these lessons
78:49 - are called quizzes thank you
78:53 - um so what is this approach
78:56 - um and i guess i could just like use p5
78:59 - first i could use a calculator
79:00 - but if i were to say like in p5 for a
79:03 - second
79:04 - um like if i were to say like 4
79:08 - let i equal 0 i is less than like 100
79:11 - i plus plus i'm going to start with the
79:15 - sum
79:16 - which is 0.25 sum plus
79:21 - plus equal itself uh divided by two
79:25 - right divided by four oh that wasn't
79:29 - one-eighth
79:30 - yeah it is no no times two oh i'm sorry
79:36 - if that's one let me look back at this
79:39 - this is 1 4 that's 1
79:43 - 16 1 16 that is not 1 8
79:46 - that's 1 16 because it's 1 fourth
79:49 - of one-fourth one-sixteenth so that was
79:52 - right i said that wrong
79:54 - sum uh divided by
79:57 - four and console log if i do that a
80:00 - hundred times what do i get
80:02 - and
80:11 - oh no i don't want to add the whole okay
80:13 - hold on some
80:14 - okay i need a
80:17 - start is i don't think i'm gonna get
80:19 - through this whole lesson today
80:21 - oh and you can't see my code oh i'm the
80:23 - worst um
80:24 - sorry about that everybody let me move
80:26 - this over
80:28 - good thing it was it's okay my code was
80:30 - like terrible anyway
80:31 - because it wasn't right so what i'm
80:33 - doing is i have a sum
80:35 - i'm starting with zero sum
80:38 - plus equal and i'm just going to say
80:39 - value sum plus equal that value
80:43 - then value
80:46 - times equals a quarter and then keep
80:49 - adding it together and together together
80:51 - let's just do that 100 times
80:52 - so stand in for infinity aha
80:55 - point three three three three three
80:57 - three one third
80:59 - i don't have the chat open anymore so
81:00 - people were probably yelling at me yeah
81:02 - one-third plus one-fourth to the power
81:04 - of number and range this is a geometric
81:06 - series okay um austin's right on every
81:10 - scale the red square is one-third of the
81:12 - blue squares that's
81:14 - um okay that's actually a great way of
81:15 - thinking about it
81:17 - that totally makes sense um so let me go
81:20 - back to the brilliant
81:21 - website i'm gonna confidently click one
81:24 - third i'm gonna hit submit
81:25 - i got this right 52 by the way i want to
81:28 - let you know
81:29 - that i get this stuff wrong i don't know
81:31 - what i was gonna say at least a quarter
81:33 - of the time if not more
81:34 - and so to me uh the and i also love the
81:37 - feedback it gives me when i get it wrong
81:39 - because um it's like very positive and
81:42 - affirming
81:43 - and i think like that's part of the
81:44 - learning process is getting it wrong
81:46 - and then i always every time i click on
81:48 - these explanations
81:49 - because i like to see what it says the
81:52 - figure can be thought of as a series of
81:53 - progressively smaller
81:55 - up and down l shapes each
81:58 - one with a dimension half of that of the
81:59 - previous one each individual shape has
82:01 - one red square and two
82:03 - blue squares for a total of three
82:06 - squares so the red makes up
82:07 - one third of each l shape so that would
82:10 - have been
82:11 - a that's an austin in the chat said that
82:13 - that would have been a great way
82:15 - um to think about it for e day next year
82:18 - says braden you should calculate e what
82:19 - day would e
82:20 - day be february something um
82:26 - i wish i could say that it hadn't been
82:28 - several years since i touched a
82:29 - geometric series
82:30 - so this could be actually an approach
82:32 - that i take a geometric
82:34 - series to cut i think oh i did this one
82:36 - i did the geometric series for
82:37 - calculating pi
82:38 - which what was that one called
82:45 - um liebnet's formula yeah i did that on
82:49 - the coding train
82:51 - coding train so this is one i did
82:53 - another year the leibniz formula
82:55 - is a method for approximating pi so
82:58 - um wonderful
83:01 - all right and austin just saw it
83:04 - intuitively which is always great to
83:05 - hear okay
83:06 - i i would like to uh so i'm gonna um you
83:09 - know keep me honest here folks tweet at
83:10 - me message me at the discord
83:12 - let me know did i finish my lesson two
83:14 - later today i'm gonna go through and
83:15 - finish this on my own
83:16 - my goal i'm trying to have a goal of
83:18 - doing one more lesson per week i feel
83:19 - like if i can get through all the
83:20 - courses on brilliant
83:22 - by doing one one lesson or one quiz per
83:24 - week that i'll have had a lot of new
83:26 - ideas and things to be teaching and
83:27 - doing on the coding train
83:28 - um just to mention a couple other
83:30 - courses um if you want to learn python
83:32 - there's a whole course
83:34 - programming with python which is an
83:35 - interactive code editor that's one that
83:37 - i've spent some time with that's really
83:38 - terrific and then a good companion piece
83:40 - to the coding train
83:41 - um is also this neural networks and ai
83:44 - oh
83:45 - just this this course about neural
83:46 - networks on the brilliant website so
83:49 - thank you so much to brilliant for
83:50 - sponsoring
83:51 - these live streams really helps keep the
83:53 - the um
83:55 - the engines running here on the coding
83:56 - train um
83:58 - i really do appreciate it i'm gonna take
83:59 - a short break and if you haven't signed
84:01 - up for brilliant
84:02 - during this break i would highly
84:03 - encourage you to head to brilliant.org
84:06 - codingtrain and i will be back in
84:08 - hopefully less
84:09 - than five minutes
84:17 - [Music]
84:42 - [Music]
84:56 - do
84:58 - [Music]
85:18 - just want to briefly drop in to
85:20 - acknowledge the
85:21 - message from whooshbot thank you so much
85:23 - i happen to be taking a break but i see
85:25 - your wonderful
85:26 - a kind message and the enthusiasm of
85:29 - viewers like you is really what keeps me
85:31 - going so thank you so much
85:40 - [Music]
85:57 - [Music]
86:24 - [Applause]
86:26 - [Music]
86:48 - do
86:53 - [Music]
87:02 - do
87:05 - [Music]
87:16 - do
87:22 - [Music]
87:30 - do
87:33 - [Music]
88:19 - [Music]
88:26 - do
88:31 - all right coming back in just a few
88:32 - minutes
88:34 - uh i'm not a few minutes sorry just like
88:37 - 30 seconds
88:38 - [Music]
88:40 - sorry
88:42 - [Music]
89:08 - do
89:10 - [Music]
89:17 - all right you know it really requires a
89:21 - lot of energy to come to these
89:25 - [Music]
89:37 - but i'm enjoying this i had a lot of
89:39 - energy at the start and i'm starting to
89:41 - fade
89:42 - but i do have some a sort of like
89:45 - and i feel like i also feel like in a
89:48 - way this is like what i want the live
89:49 - streams to be which is just a hangout
89:52 - session um i think maybe it's actually a
89:54 - little less appealing to
89:56 - some of the audience who would much
89:57 - rather just see me like working on
89:59 - like building tetris basically in a
90:01 - two-hour live stream which
90:02 - that kind of thing gets requested a lot
90:05 - and i do aspire to do it actually tetris
90:07 - and funny to mention that is
90:08 - something that i really have high on my
90:09 - list now of um i don't know if that
90:11 - should be like a multi-part coding
90:13 - series or just something i do in the
90:14 - live stream
90:16 - but um i don't know so your feedback is
90:18 - welcome how to make
90:19 - you know my focus right now is really on
90:20 - the tutorial videos that i'm doing
90:23 - um and then i think i will pivot
90:24 - hopefully come around um
90:26 - april or may um to being able to do some
90:29 - other content but um if you have sort of
90:33 - thoughts or feedback about what
90:34 - uh what you like about the videos i
90:38 - release versus the
90:39 - live streams and how to um
90:42 - you know um how it's all feeling for you
90:45 - um it'd be great to hear i mean it's
90:47 - interesting i have finally now
90:50 - separated the live streams
90:54 - from the produced sequence tutorials and
90:58 - coding challenge videos
90:59 - so before it was all the same thing
91:03 - where i would my live stream was really
91:05 - just a live stream of my recording
91:07 - session
91:08 - now i do those recording sessions i
91:09 - still do actually stream those for
91:11 - members to sort of like tune into to
91:13 - like
91:13 - help give me feedback but they're much
91:15 - more of like actual recording session
91:17 - with no community
91:19 - segments um and
91:22 - um jodhwat says plan the comment i see
91:25 - in the chat
91:26 - is a plan and yeah so i'm often
91:28 - wondering do i need more of a plan
91:30 - so anyway your feedback is welcome i'm
91:32 - not gonna be doing that much live
91:33 - streaming to be perfectly honest
91:35 - in the next couple months um there's
91:37 - gonna be two more hopefully in march one
91:39 - or two more in march one will be with a
91:40 - guest
91:41 - um and then and then i'm just taking a
91:43 - few weeks off and alex
91:45 - subscribe to brilliant that's so nice
91:48 - glad to hear all right um
91:52 - i've lost the live the coding train
91:55 - member chat there it is i've got it back
91:58 - um is this the end already guess what
92:01 - it's not
92:03 - i'm off to do one more thing
92:06 - and i had a kind of longer list of but
92:08 - oh just as a reminder
92:10 - if you have um ideas for and thank you
92:12 - to brilliant for the sponsorship
92:14 - um if you have ideas for pi day videos
92:17 - please post those in discord
92:20 - or in the github repo someone can maybe
92:23 - share that
92:25 - um the night sky writes longer beard
92:29 - should make the audience
92:30 - focus better interesting interesting
92:34 - there's there by the way there's like a
92:35 - period of time somewhere in the sort of
92:37 - like
92:38 - um you know beginning of quarantine
92:41 - we're still really in quarantine here um
92:45 - where my beard had gotten i never have
92:47 - gotten that long i saw a
92:49 - i saw like an image of me from one of
92:50 - those live streams and i was like
92:52 - shocked
92:53 - because it didn't seem that crazy to me
92:54 - at the time
92:56 - but like whoa it had gotten really crazy
92:59 - um all right so here's the thing that i
93:01 - need to do
93:03 - i need is some sort of interesting word
93:05 - choice of mine there i mean i
93:08 - i don't know really why i need to do
93:09 - this but um i'm going to go here so
93:12 - all you you know if you've been a coding
93:14 - trained viewer for a while
93:15 - or even recently for a short while that
93:18 - i have an obsession with this book
93:20 - a million random digits with a hundred
93:21 - thousand normal normal deviates i'm
93:23 - still looking for an original print
93:26 - of this book that is fully intact with
93:28 - every page it will be my prized
93:30 - possession if i can ever
93:31 - track down a copy um
93:36 - um but um anyway i have this version and
93:39 - i
93:40 - and i'm i'm working on this project
93:42 - where
93:43 - i'm laser etching and i really should
93:44 - bring the strain whistle that has the
93:47 - actual test
93:48 - laser etch on it laser etching a random
93:50 - walk pattern onto train whistles and
93:52 - sending them as gifts
93:54 - to members of the coding train um
93:58 - and i don't know austin is that question
94:00 - for me because
94:02 - definitely doing more server side stuff
94:04 - recently and i
94:05 - often get the feedback people like why
94:06 - are you doing all this database and blah
94:08 - blah blah
94:08 - stuff um um
94:15 - so i'm reading the chat the same time
94:17 - while i'm talking so i
94:19 - think for the authenticity the total and
94:22 - pure beautiful authenticity of these
94:24 - train whistles
94:25 - and for other things that i want to do
94:27 - like perhaps this pi day video
94:29 - i would like to have access to
94:33 - the random number sequence of 100
94:36 - million digits that is in this book
94:39 - in a i don't know what what i should put
94:41 - in a json file a text file a binary file
94:44 - i'll make a whole web api i'm not sure
94:48 - but so but let me download some of these
94:51 - data file well this is actually all i
94:53 - want
94:55 - i spent a lot of time talking about this
94:57 - oh
94:58 - only to reveal that here it is
95:02 - exactly what i need the 1 million
95:05 - the table of random digits in plain form
95:08 - so what's in these other ones
95:12 - this is in pdf anyway i'm just going to
95:15 - download this one
95:19 - let us open it up
95:22 - let me open it in um
95:26 - just put it on the desktop here and go
95:29 - to terminal
95:37 - what's it called digits.txt
95:42 - and there we go oh interesting this is
95:45 - actually in the file so i'm gonna have
95:46 - to do some parsing of this
95:49 - so the other thing about this right now
95:50 - i remember why i want to do this
95:52 - because i ultimately i have space by the
95:56 - way
95:58 - for one million that'll be
96:01 - i don't know what i'm going to do if i
96:02 - ever have one million people join as a
96:04 - member of the coding train but they're
96:05 - one million spots basically
96:07 - right i would like to produce all one
96:10 - million of these terrain whistles
96:11 - eventually
96:12 - oh oh that could be kind of awesome
96:15 - okay what if like everyone was unique
96:18 - okay this is cool
96:19 - this is cool okay totally i love this i
96:21 - love this okay
96:22 - so first things first let's just do an
96:25 - exploratory session for a moment
96:29 - where um i am going to
96:32 - load this into the discord bot that i've
96:35 - been working on
96:36 - like ultimately in some sense i want to
96:37 - make this a separate project like
96:39 - the random number sequence api project
96:43 - or member coding train member database
96:45 - project
96:46 - but let's wrap it into the discord bot
96:48 - for a second
96:49 - so i'm going to go to very convenient
96:53 - and i know that i said i was going to
96:55 - look at the live poll today
96:59 - sorry about that i'm the worst um
97:02 - [Music]
97:03 - i'm the worst okay so i'm in the image
97:06 - generation i can't remember where i left
97:08 - this off
97:08 - maybe somebody can remember discord bot
97:11 - choo choo
97:15 - um all right did i merge this branch
97:19 - pull request oh
97:23 - oh i've had some
97:29 - oh this is the image generation so why
97:31 - didn't i merge this
97:33 - i don't know i see no reason not to
97:40 - i'm about working this branch a little
97:42 - bit longer so i'm sort of remember i'm
97:44 - gonna go to glitch for a second where i
97:46 - actually have the bot
97:49 - and my very very clever
97:52 - and super amazing way of disabling the
97:55 - bot
97:56 - is to comment out the code so this is
97:59 - the actual
98:01 - deployment of choo choo bot which is
98:03 - running on glitch i should probably
98:05 - i love glitch and i think it makes sense
98:07 - for a lot of things that i do
98:09 - but maybe the discord bot actually
98:10 - should be deployed somewhere else
98:12 - um so now if i let's just see
98:17 - if i'm in the right place here
98:22 - um if i run it
98:25 - what oh i forgot i was trying to i
98:29 - forgot that i was
98:30 - in a speculative place
98:34 - oh right and fun planet showed me how to
98:36 - do this i never follow up on this stuff
98:39 - i'm the worst
98:40 - i gotta get to the summer where i don't
98:42 - have like other work i have to do all
98:43 - week in between live streams and i can
98:46 - like
98:46 - follow up and remember what i've done so
98:48 - hold on hold on everybody
98:50 - uh let me let me open up this pro i'm
98:53 - gonna get there if you will just
98:54 - be patient with me um i'm
98:58 - going to go to generate.js
99:04 - and remove require p5
99:08 - which is all i need to do i think
99:09 - actually i think i just left that
99:12 - in there there we go great so now i
99:13 - think if i go to
99:15 - um discord is this only i don't did i
99:17 - remove the idea of it running only in
99:19 - one channel
99:22 - um so where's my commands.js no but let
99:24 - me take that out
99:27 - um so i'm just going to use my a channel
99:30 - where only i have permission in i think
99:33 - we'll see if this works so i'm going to
99:35 - discord
99:37 - and i'm just going to use this channel
99:39 - like
99:41 - if i do this command
99:47 - i don't have the permissions all right
99:49 - can somebody please
99:53 - oh fun planet there you are you're
99:54 - watching oh fun planet thank you so much
99:56 - for all of those
99:57 - i really like fallen was so excited
99:58 - about that i was like i want to make
100:00 - actually and i would love to collaborate
100:03 - on this or if you just want to like go
100:04 - for it i will
100:05 - really support and champion you but i
100:07 - wanted to make a lot node library
100:09 - that was not that was like a node p5
100:12 - library
100:13 - that allowed you to do p5 in node but
100:15 - didn't actually
100:16 - have um well either had that didn't have
100:20 - i don't know how to best do this i
100:23 - didn't want to like
100:24 - change the p5 code itself i want this to
100:27 - be a wrapper of some additional code
100:29 - so that as the p5 library grows and
100:32 - changes over time
100:33 - it can always just stay in sync with it
100:35 - but we're not
100:36 - um so that's that's kind of my
100:39 - my plan so um did i vamp long enough is
100:42 - there somebody who's a mod here
100:44 - um who can um who can fix the
100:47 - um and maybe i'll just do it myself i'm
100:49 - going to try to fix the permissions of
100:51 - the bot
100:52 - testing channel
100:56 - um so how do i do that um
101:02 - channel edit channel
101:06 - permissions advanced permissions
101:10 - is what i want um
101:13 - everyone see i don't know how to do this
101:16 - quickly
101:17 - i'm gonna make everyone not be able to
101:18 - send messages
101:20 - i think this is fine i think that might
101:22 - have been enough
101:24 - somebody can hopefully fix it for me but
101:26 - i'm back so i'm in this channel
101:27 - which should have
101:32 - the bot going and that was
101:35 - running right from here uh did i call it
101:38 - generate
101:39 - was it random walk oh yeah there we go
101:42 - great
101:44 - i don't see any console logging happens
101:46 - which makes me nervous
101:51 - like like i don't i seriously don't have
101:54 - like a console log
101:57 - uh it's just
102:11 - okay okay great i'm in the right code
102:14 - my bot is running so this is what i
102:17 - sorry for that i've got
102:18 - i've got 20 minutes here to do um uh to
102:22 - do about what i want to do so i'm going
102:23 - to take this
102:24 - file digits.dxt txt
102:28 - i am going to put it into
102:31 - uh discord bot choo choo commands
102:35 - um the question is where to store it
102:40 - let's just store it here in the root
102:42 - directory for right now
102:45 - is this by the way are these tabs i'm
102:47 - not sure
102:48 - and then um
102:52 - let's go to uh the code
102:56 - i can close this so i've got the digits
102:59 - here
103:00 - now in this command
103:03 - i do want the file system
103:08 - and i want to say uh digits equals or
103:11 - i'm just going to say raw
103:13 - digits equals file system read file sync
103:21 - how do i do this like something like
103:23 - this if i want to go back one directory
103:26 - i should know this kind of stuff
103:29 - and then and then i want to say
103:33 - [Music]
103:37 - utf-8
103:41 - okay so i'm loading the raw digits
103:45 - i need a little bit more room for the
103:47 - code here
103:50 - then um let's just see if that works
104:03 - okay that worked so there's all the raw
104:06 - digits
104:06 - now i need to um
104:11 - now i need to chop this up to make it an
104:13 - array of all the digits
104:15 - but i need to so i guess like
104:25 - like what if i do split and i split it
104:28 - by a regular expression which is just
104:30 - any white space
104:38 - let's see what i got
104:42 - okay great so then how do i get rid of
104:46 - all of the
104:47 - row numbers which i don't need so if
104:50 - there
104:50 - are in the digits file one two
104:53 - three four five six seven
104:57 - eight nine ten so
105:00 - every so 0 9
105:04 - i'm sorry 0 10 20 if the index modulus
105:07 - 10 is 0. so should i use filter
105:17 - i'll call it randoms digits filter
105:22 - is there like can i in the filter
105:24 - function can i get an
105:28 - index
105:32 - so i want to filter out or is this or is
105:34 - this all that i want to keep so i'm
105:36 - using this
105:37 - higher order javascript function i
105:38 - thought i have no idea if this will work
105:40 - to basically filter out everything
105:44 - um oh i could split with the line break
105:47 - says arnab that's a smart idea
105:49 - so but let's see if this works this i
105:51 - want to filter out every tenth element
105:54 - um let's see if this works
105:58 - i also could use the spaces between the
105:59 - row number and the data yeah there's
106:01 - lots of other ways i could do this
106:11 - uh did that work doesn't seem like it
106:28 - yes does not
106:32 - does not equal zero well hold on
106:36 - oh i had console log digits still in
106:37 - there so maybe that did work
106:39 - or if it did it did the hold on
106:43 - i think that might have hold up
106:46 - console.log randoms.length
106:55 - 000 that is not right
107:07 - 22 000 interesting
107:10 - i wonder if as i'm filtering it if the
107:16 - all right let's split it up let's let's
107:18 - do it um let's do rows
107:21 - by rows and i can concat all right
107:29 - let's try this
107:35 - okay that kind of seems right
107:41 - right okay so now what if i
107:47 - uh rows
107:59 - so for every row of rows
108:04 - [Music]
108:07 - digits equals rho dot split
108:11 - by any number of spaces
108:17 - and then uh splice
108:20 - the first one out
108:24 - there's 11 index modulus 11
108:28 - there's 11.
108:33 - one two three four five six seven eight
108:35 - nine ten
108:36 - oh but because the number is there it's
108:38 - eleven
108:39 - oh so that would have totally worked
108:44 - okay let's go back i i don't know i
108:47 - couldn't like my brain couldn't make
108:48 - that
108:49 - happen uh um hold on i'm gonna keep this
108:55 - because i like what i'm uh people were
108:58 - saying that to me in the chat
109:00 - and i was not i was just like what
109:02 - that's weird that's not right i just
109:03 - like completely ignored it but
109:05 - i just see it uh thank you arnov for
109:07 - like
109:09 - being very clear about that let's okay
109:12 - so
109:12 - this should be
109:16 - and i just want to save this other way
109:19 - that i was trying it
109:23 - so let's see if this gets it to me uh
109:29 - oh digits
109:33 - should be an s oops i've kind of missed
109:35 - some things here there we go
109:41 - hundred thousand
109:51 - twenty thousand and one that's weird
110:00 - does um a line break not count as white
110:08 - space
110:12 - it's definitely not equals
110:18 - did i download the wrong file
110:25 - did i download the wrong file
110:37 - why are there only why are there
110:41 - 220 0001 numbers
110:45 - and not 1 million
111:12 - hmm all right hold on let's go back to
111:16 - my rows
111:17 - splitting for a second
111:21 - do i i don't need a g there with split
111:23 - do i for global
111:28 - uh oh i hear my i have a feeling cooking
111:31 - class bacon class has ended it's digits
111:33 - not numbs
111:39 - so weird okay hold on let me let me go
111:42 - back to my more manual way of doing this
111:59 - 20 000 yeah
112:06 - it's a million digits it's never been a
112:10 - million numbers
112:13 - i've been wrong this whole time my whole
112:17 - life i've completely misunderstood this
112:19 - book
112:20 - and i never bothered to check
112:25 - is this about this
112:28 - i'm so confused
112:34 - i got hold on a sec
112:37 - there are 200 000 numbers all this time
112:40 - i could have read this my whole life is
112:42 - alive
112:44 - this whole time i only had to there's
112:46 - only i've i've been thinking there's a
112:47 - million random numbers in this book
112:49 - there's only 200 000 which is fine
112:51 - that makes my life easier thank you very
112:53 - much and you need your stupid 1 million
112:55 - numbers anyway
112:57 - does he probably say this right in the
112:58 - introduction
113:00 - um am i supposed to think of this as
113:03 - random numbers
113:04 - zero through nine
113:10 - the random numbers in this book were
113:11 - produced by a re-randomization of a
113:13 - basic table generated by an electronic
113:15 - roulette wheel
113:28 - should but how should i be thinking of
113:30 - this
113:32 - should i be thinking of the
113:35 - book as a million i could by the way i
113:38 - could only take 200
113:40 - 000 members now of the coding trade i
113:41 - can no longer have one million members
113:44 - i got to re i read the whole
113:45 - introduction but like years ago
113:47 - and i i obviously didn't retain what's
113:49 - in it and i don't think i could just
113:50 - reasonably read it right now
113:56 - um so the question is there are 200 000
113:58 - i'm going to still consider them
114:02 - five digit numbers so for the sake of
114:04 - argument right now i'm going to consider
114:06 - them five
114:06 - digit numbers um and only
114:10 - um yeah because i want to have i want to
114:13 - have 200 000
114:14 - unique are they unique or all well let's
114:18 - find out
114:19 - i need to find i need to know right now
114:21 - if all the numbers are unique
114:23 - all the five digit numbers are unique
114:27 - no well no they can't be
114:31 - they can't be unique
114:37 - they are bunched up in fives but you can
114:39 - choose any number of the digits to form
114:41 - your own random numbers as big or small
114:43 - as
114:43 - like that is the idea
114:47 - but how do i use them grouping random
114:49 - digits zero to nine into groups of five
114:51 - does give you random numbers
114:54 - zero to ninety nine thousand nine
114:56 - hundred ninety nine i guess
114:57 - yeah can you see if any of the random
115:00 - numbers begin with one or more zeros
115:02 - they do
115:03 - they do they absolutely do
115:08 - um
115:12 - chris writes i was going to join the
115:14 - channel but now that seems like rubbing
115:16 - it in
115:17 - right there's no way that they're unique
115:18 - but they're not unique
115:20 - how many unique ones are there
115:24 - and so if you get a random number you
115:26 - get it all over the book
115:29 - all right we're gonna keep them we're
115:32 - gonna keep them as
115:33 - five i mean i'm gonna make a just sort
115:35 - of executive decision right now
115:38 - good news is my algorithm here is
115:40 - correct
115:45 - this should give me two hundred thousand
115:46 - five digit numbers
115:49 - two hundred thousand perfect
115:52 - so now i would like to sort this array
115:57 - um so let's do
116:01 - i forg always forget does sorting the
116:03 - array actually change the array i think
116:04 - it does
116:05 - random sort um
116:17 - oh this is more than i have time for
116:19 - right now
116:26 - okay so i've sorted them
116:31 - so is every number there is one question
116:36 - and um
116:42 - yes every number there i need to do like
116:44 - a
116:47 - array to set what if you convert array
116:50 - to set
116:51 - oh that's an interesting idea
116:57 - i was going to manually filter them
116:59 - myself
117:00 - like into groups
117:04 - and
117:08 - every number is not there
117:18 - right if if zero is there four times
117:21 - by definition that means there's not
117:23 - enough space for every number
117:25 - pigeonhole principle i've heard this
117:27 - term before
117:29 - pigeonhole principle
117:36 - yeah yeah
117:41 - ten pigeon nine whole since 10 is
117:43 - greater than nine at least one whole lot
117:44 - of
117:45 - set is actually a good idea okay uh
117:48 - javascript
117:50 - set
117:54 - i wanted to count how many each was in
117:56 - there but that's overkill for right now
117:59 - uh so if somebody's random oh that's why
118:02 - the
118:02 - column and row the index of the random
118:04 - number is actually important
118:06 - that's going to affect okay so there's
118:08 - still 200 000
118:10 - spots if the idea is that you're getting
118:11 - a spot in the sequence even if you have
118:14 - the same random number now i should try
118:16 - to give people unique random numbers
118:18 - but if the idea is that you're getting
118:20 - your random walk
118:22 - it's going to be 200 000 iterations
118:26 - you're getting all okay okay so
118:29 - i'm actually not going to worry about
118:31 - this right now
118:32 - just for a moment that will come later
118:38 - what i want to do is
118:43 - um so i'll come back to all this and
118:46 - probably be worth making it actually be
118:49 - worth
118:49 - totally making an api oh here's a
118:51 - project for us as a coding trained
118:53 - community
118:53 - let's make an api which has the raw text
118:57 - of the sequence
118:58 - and then you can ask it for like give me
119:01 - um
119:02 - one million numbers random numbers zero
119:04 - through nine
119:05 - give me uh 500 000 numbers
119:08 - zero through 19 basically um
119:12 - so um so that would be that's a great
119:14 - that's another project but let me just
119:16 - follow this through a little bit more
119:18 - so um so i'm going to call this random s
119:23 - which is the strings and then randoms
119:26 - equals random s map
119:32 - parse int elt
119:36 - so this should give it to me as actual
119:38 - numbers
119:43 - okay so now i've got them as actual
119:45 - numbers
119:46 - and there's 200 000 of them and what i
119:49 - want to do is i want the argument
119:53 - of the message
119:57 - i want to give it a seed
120:01 - so if args
120:04 - dot length is greater than zero
120:08 - so let's have let seed equal
120:12 - random math math.random
120:16 - times randoms.length and
120:19 - floor that
120:24 - then if args.length is greater than zero
120:28 - then seed equals um parseint
120:32 - args index zero
120:36 - you know i should check if it um i'll
120:39 - add it to do here
120:40 - to do uh check that argument
120:44 - is valid number
120:47 - between zero and um
120:51 - right 199 999 right then i'm going to
120:54 - call
120:54 - generate image seed so we're going to
120:57 - get the seed here
120:59 - we're not going to do it a million times
121:02 - i start to zero i
121:03 - is less than randoms.length
121:09 - [Music]
121:12 - and then the number r is
121:16 - random randoms index
121:19 - i plus seed modulusrandoms.length
121:24 - is that right let me put that in a
121:25 - separate variable index equals
121:28 - i plus the seed modulusrandoms.length
121:33 - so this this should
121:37 - pull and then this should be that
121:40 - number modulus 4.
121:44 - so this should take the seat from from
121:46 - any it's not actually the seed value
121:49 - i should not call it seed right now
121:51 - because i might want to use it as a seed
121:52 - eventually but this is really starting
121:55 - index is really what this is
122:00 - and i'll just call it offset because
122:02 - it's really the offset
122:04 - i plus offset so the idea being that
122:08 - i'm going to always produce the same
122:10 - exact random number pattern
122:13 - um by starting at a certain number in
122:16 - the sequence of 200
122:18 - 000 numbers and then iterating over all
122:20 - of them from there
122:23 - and ultimately i could go through it
122:24 - twice or something but let's see what
122:25 - this let's see what this gives me
122:30 - all right so let's go to discord
122:33 - type generate let's see what i go oh it
122:36 - should tell me the
122:37 - shoot so i want it also to
122:44 - return
122:47 - um return the buffer and also let me do
122:50 - this again
122:51 - um so the attachment is so this
122:55 - is um then i can also say buffer
122:58 - dot index
123:01 - here's your random walk starting at
123:06 - index right that should
123:09 - let me just make sure do this work
123:14 - oh why'd i get an error there let's see
123:16 - what happens i
123:17 - did get an error oh we got an error
123:20 - let's see
123:22 - random is not defined where
123:29 - ah randoms.length this is a terrible
123:32 - name for a variable by the way
123:33 - randoms terrible name for a variable but
123:38 - let's see if this works
123:44 - let's just make sure the bot is live
123:48 - by the way i hate that this is called
123:49 - generate it should be called
123:52 - let me rename it now the now is not the
123:54 - time i want to change the command to
123:56 - random walk or something
123:58 - generate
124:01 - at undefined good work everybody here's
124:04 - your random walk starting at
124:06 - undefined why is that undefined
124:10 - uh
124:13 - return buffer oh it's called offset
124:17 - well no wonder i can't just make up a
124:18 - variable name here
124:26 - okay um
124:29 - i mean i guess i know what it is because
124:31 - i have it here
124:32 - so this is silly for me to get it back
124:35 - oh yeah i don't need to get it back it's
124:37 - picked here
124:38 - what am i doing i mean it's good it's
124:41 - like
124:42 - now i'm making sure it's right but um
124:48 - that was silly let's just do
124:52 - that okay
124:56 - here we go generate
125:01 - it got an error the resource must be a
125:05 - string
125:06 - buffer or val oh
125:10 - oh i'm still doing this though
125:14 - took it out of here
125:19 - no what am i doing where am i
125:28 - okay
125:32 - oh hold on i'm getting some messages
125:34 - breaking news here uh-oh
125:37 - things aren't good downstairs in baking
125:39 - class i've gotta go
125:41 - okay 8063 so here
125:45 - here is the real test
125:50 - ah
125:52 - [Music]
125:53 - that is so good who's who just joined
125:57 - what was terence's random number
125:59 - who joined
126:03 - uh i'm still returning yeah oh no you're
126:07 - behind me
126:07 - chat you're behind i already fixed that
126:09 - um let's just generate zero
126:13 - generate zero
126:17 - beautiful all right this is good we're
126:20 - getting the unique
126:21 - pattern for any given number
126:24 - in the sequence of 200 000 numbers
126:29 - yes now if i wanted to have it be one
126:31 - million numbers
126:32 - i really could because
126:37 - um
126:40 - because i only have four options for the
126:42 - random walker so i guess i can make that
126:43 - decision later
126:45 - but i want to just change a couple of
126:46 - things
126:48 - [Music]
126:50 - one is
126:53 - first i don't need to do this console
126:57 - log anymore
127:00 - um loading sequence of random numbers
127:06 - i so that's done i also want to change
127:09 - this command to rename
127:12 - i'm going to call this random walk
127:16 - and update imports for random walk
127:19 - i don't know sure yes
127:22 - um what does that do oh
127:26 - random walk
127:29 - random walk okay i think that
127:33 - actually should be all that i need to do
127:34 - to change it i should probably put this
127:36 - back
127:38 - to only being in the bot testing channel
127:41 - because that's sort of the point of this
127:43 - particular bot
127:48 - and now hello oh it's
127:51 - it's running um choo choo
127:56 - now generate should give me nothing
127:57 - except it gives me an error
127:59 - because i don't have any error handling
128:01 - it's just the words
128:04 - i thought i added error handling maybe
128:05 - there's a pull request for it
128:07 - generate so now i should be able to say
128:09 - random walk
128:12 - it'll give me a random one so the idea
128:14 - also could be that
128:15 - it would look up in the database my
128:18 - random number and give me that one
128:20 - or i could request a specific one um by
128:25 - and this should still be the same
128:28 - this is still the same image as this one
128:30 - right so we're in good shape
128:32 - now um there also was a pull request i
128:34 - saw that somebody did wrap around
128:36 - so that it would sort of like also come
128:38 - maybe over here if it was going up to
128:39 - the top so
128:39 - maybe i should add that as well but this
128:41 - is good i'm going to say
128:45 - uh get an ad
128:49 - adding the random digits sequence
128:52 - from book um i am
128:56 - um finishing up by the way this is it
128:58 - this is the end of today's live stream
129:00 - i'm gonna deploy this uh hopefully
129:04 - i'm gonna um throw caution to the wind
129:07 - and find the github repo
129:11 - uh for this particular
129:15 - pull request which is now got this i'm
129:19 - going to merge it
129:23 - i'm going to cancel it uh here it's not
129:26 - running
129:27 - then i'm going to go do my ridiculous
129:29 - way on glitch
129:31 - of whoops of of making the bot run
129:35 - so i'm going to go to tools
129:39 - import and export and by the way i'm
129:43 - never supposed to i should not be
129:45 - showing this but i think there's enough
129:46 - characters
129:48 - that are covered up i suppose somebody
129:50 - could probably
129:52 - now check all the possibilities and
129:53 - eventually get it
129:55 - good luck to you i'll just have to uh
129:58 - delete and recreate this project or
130:00 - something
130:01 - um but that's sort of a problem that
130:04 - that just shows up here
130:06 - and now i'm going to do this
130:21 - and then
130:24 - uh it should be
130:28 - running now
130:35 - hold on oh it's still like
130:39 - installing some stuff
130:47 - okay
130:54 - great
131:09 - hi code guppy thank you very kind wait
131:13 - did the 8063 look the same
131:18 - it's similar it's very similar
131:21 - it's a very similar the sequence is
131:23 - always the same you have to remember
131:24 - that it's just where you start
131:26 - so the patterns are actually going to be
131:28 - quite like like if i
131:30 - now if i say random
131:34 - walk one like how different is this
131:36 - going to be
131:41 - pretty pretty pretty similar
131:44 - i can't even tell the difference at all
131:46 - so is that a problem
131:48 - it kind of is but i think that
131:52 - there's still two hundred thousand like
131:54 - if i do one hundred thousand
131:59 - i think it's going to be pretty diff oh
132:01 - sorry random walk
132:07 - so um maybe there's a better way to do
132:09 - this to have them all be more unique
132:12 - um but you can see that they are there
132:15 - are
132:16 - this one is quite different 8063 is not
132:19 - that far away
132:20 - from zero considering touring papa the
132:22 - sun is out oh my goodness
132:24 - it is 3 p.m the sun is out i think it's
132:27 - over 50 degrees fahrenheit here
132:29 - um code guppy you are much too kind
132:32 - these donations are
132:33 - very very appreciated but definitely
132:35 - unnecessary um
132:37 - it is going well thank you for the super
132:38 - stickers and
132:40 - i am going to
132:45 - say goodbye so i got some stuff
132:49 - accomplished today please
132:50 - share with me your oh oh am i blowing
132:53 - everybody's ears out
132:55 - how's the volume of that song right now
132:57 - let me know before i keep playing it
133:00 - um
133:02 - um skip digits different like there's
133:04 - all sorts of ways i could vary this but
133:06 - that's kind of not the point right
133:08 - the point is we're all getting a random
133:10 - walk according to the book
133:12 - slight variations um but it sounds like
133:15 - i am being called away
133:18 - so um i'm just gonna like lower the
133:21 - volume to be safe down here
133:23 - uh are the blondies ready
133:29 - okay but i should stop now huh i'm still
133:31 - i'm currently live streaming
133:33 - but i'm i'm wrapping up all right um
133:36 - it is beautiful outside nice and sunny
133:38 - in michigan are we gonna go out to the
133:39 - park
133:40 - no i'm reading the chat somebody from
133:42 - michigan wrote a nice message in the
133:44 - chat
133:45 - it's we're not in michigan we're in
133:48 - brooklyn
133:50 - all right um my children are here they
133:53 - gave
133:53 - they were kind enough to allow me these
133:55 - two hours of live streaming with you
133:57 - it's actually been about two hours and
133:58 - 10 minutes
134:00 - i'm gonna let this um yeah osama is
134:03 - saying look for a json file with a
134:05 - random one million numbers
134:06 - i could find that that's not the point
134:08 - the point is
134:10 - this is the book the coding trade bible
134:13 - so to speak if you will
134:15 - um this is our text our you know if
134:18 - um hopefully i'm not like by accident
134:20 - starting some sort of strange um
134:22 - cult here go to trade cult but this is
134:25 - this is the core
134:26 - text so i want to tie everything to this
134:28 - book um
134:29 - just for fun thank you austin oh yes for
134:31 - reminding me
134:32 - to thank brilliant um the sponsor push
134:35 - to get it is pushed
134:37 - um i'm also gonna um unlock the bot
134:40 - testing channel
134:41 - and let me do that um
134:45 - let me go to here and go to permissions
134:48 - and go to
134:49 - advanced and back to
134:53 - everyone being able to send messages
134:57 - save changes and i'm going to leave
135:02 - and now you should be able to work with
135:05 - the bot yourself in the discord
135:07 - codingtrain.com
135:08 - discord link in the chat that i just
135:11 - posted as well
135:12 - um thank you for telling me it was a fun
135:15 - stream jiao dat i appreciate that
135:18 - i can't hear the music at all can you um
135:22 - [Music]
135:24 - and stay tuned uh there's a
135:27 - self-avoiding walk coding challenge that
135:29 - needs to come out there are four
135:31 - chapter four of nature of code videos
135:32 - that are on their way
135:34 - i have a little short five minute video
135:37 - about a template literal in javascript
135:39 - that i have
135:40 - not seemed to manage to produce that has
135:42 - a theme song
135:44 - so that's coming out soon and
135:48 - um i will see you all maybe so
135:51 - the next live stream i mean just check
135:53 - you know subscribe all that nonsense
135:55 - stuff um you know
135:56 - i will say that i'm pretty low and i
135:59 - look let me pause for a second
136:00 - when i look at my stats i could i would
136:02 - pull them up if i felt confident how to
136:04 - do that
136:04 - it shows me how many people who have
136:06 - subscribed have notifications
136:08 - on and that how and also as a percentage
136:11 - how many people have notifications on
136:13 - as well as all notifications on for my
136:16 - channel
136:16 - i really low like i have a very large
136:19 - number of subscribers
136:20 - but a really low percentage of people
136:22 - with the notifications on
136:24 - so if you don't know about that fee i'm
136:26 - not asking you to turn those
136:27 - notifications on if you don't want to
136:28 - get them
136:29 - i don't want to spam people but if
136:32 - you're not aware of that feature
136:34 - um i would encourage you to go and do
136:36 - that right now in terms of
136:37 - that will give you certainly like when i
136:40 - schedule a live stream
136:42 - that will then show up as a notification
136:45 - when i am live streaming and then of
136:46 - course when new videos are posted as
136:47 - well
136:47 - so a little bit of plug for myself um
136:52 - you know ring the bell hit that bell
136:54 - whatever i mean
136:55 - but but i i i find that the whole like
136:59 - you know it's just noise at this point
137:00 - if you're watching a video and somebody
137:02 - says
137:02 - don't forget to subscribe and click that
137:04 - bell it's just like it's everywhere so
137:06 - you know i i want to be like
137:07 - conscientious about asking you to do
137:09 - things
137:10 - but i do think there might be a little
137:11 - bit of a disconnect where a lot of the
137:13 - viewers either
137:14 - maybe rightfully so don't don't want
137:17 - they want notification
137:18 - and this could make sense actually like
137:19 - maybe you only want notifications from
137:22 - a youtube channel that does like once a
137:24 - month
137:25 - high quality video 10 minutes long well
137:28 - produced
137:29 - uh you really just want to make sure you
137:30 - watch their monthly 10-minute video
137:32 - whereas a coding channel might have
137:34 - weekly live streams tutorials popping up
137:35 - every few days and it's just a mess of
137:37 - notifications for you but
137:39 - so i'm going to stop talking about all
137:41 - of that um and just thank all of you
137:44 - uh for being here today there's about 10
137:46 - seconds left in this song
137:48 - and i will see you i'm join the discord
137:50 - i'm gonna leave this chat will be open
137:52 - for a little bit because i'll play some
137:53 - outro music so if you're not sure about
137:55 - how to join the discord how to engage
137:57 - with the community how to get your
137:58 - notifications turned on
138:00 - how to join as a member all that stuff
138:01 - you can ask it in the chat all right and
138:03 - i will see you all next time on the
138:05 - coding train
138:06 - as always i always forget that this dot
138:15 - these p5.js hearts oh my goodness
138:18 - i uh i knocked over the music
138:25 - as always these p5.js dots are a symbol
138:28 - of my love
138:29 - for you the viewers of the coding train
138:31 - for all the people of the world
138:33 - coders and non-coders alike i see
138:36 - i spy through the window there a
138:38 - beautiful sunny day
138:40 - i don't know what the weather is like
138:41 - might be the middle of the night for you
138:43 - but take some time away from your
138:44 - screens from your computers from your
138:46 - coding if you can
138:48 - it's hard to be with people these days
138:50 - but you can be with sunshine or
138:52 - nature or fresh air or a book
138:55 - stumble up with a book a painting of
138:57 - drawing something um
138:58 - find that for yourself at least today
139:00 - thank you to
139:02 - [Music]
139:03 - brilliance who is the sponsor and
139:05 - certainly
139:07 - uh when after you've taken your break
139:08 - from the computer uh
139:10 - i just stopped talking goodbye
139:15 - i can't find the button to take me out
139:17 - of here i found it now
139:29 - never forget this dot somebody composed
139:32 - that song for me
139:46 - i'm gonna say once again here we go
139:49 - sing it with me it's the forward new
139:52 - cartesian
139:53 - coordinate song
139:55 - [Music]
139:59 - it's the forward to cartesian
140:11 - [Music]
