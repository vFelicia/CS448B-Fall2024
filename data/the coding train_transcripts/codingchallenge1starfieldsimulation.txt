00:00 - Hello welcome to the
00:01 - ten minute coding challenge.
00:03 - This is a new segment that I am
00:04 - starting here on the "coding rainbow".
00:07 - Where I am given a programming problem
00:09 - and I am given 10 minutes to solve that problem
00:12 - and then the timer goes I've got to stop recording.
00:14 - So, uh, someone- uh, I'm not prepared for this but,
00:18 - normally I'd get a coding challenge from somebody
00:20 - so, [insert person's twitter handle here].
00:22 - Uh, wrote in and asked,
00:24 - "How do you make a star-field, warp speed, simulation visualization?"
00:29 - So I'm gonna do this in the Processing programming environment
00:31 - I will also make a p5 JS version of it, but not in this 10 minutes-
00:36 - and I am talking way too much, I gotta get started programming!
00:38 - So, this first thing I wanna do-
00:40 - and I, I'm gonna skip a few steps here that I might normally do
00:42 - just because I feel like I'm in a little bit of a hurry, and I see the clock
00:45 - I already lose a minute of start, and I haven't started programming yet.
00:47 - I'm gonna make a- ohps! Nope, don't rename.
00:49 - I'm gonna make a new tab here, and I'm gonna call that tab "Star",
00:53 - because what I wanna do is make a "Star" class, and I want my Star class-
00:57 - and I probably could use a PVector, but um
01:00 - I'm not gonna use a PVector at the moment
01:01 - I wanna have an X, and a Y, and a Z.
01:04 - Um, and when I make a Star object
01:06 - I want to make
01:09 - I want the X to have a random value
01:11 - between zero and the width of the window
01:14 - and Y to have a random between zero and the height of the window
01:18 - And the truth of the matter is, for simplicity's sake
01:22 - I wonder if anyone's gonna watch this video on YouTube on like
01:25 - two-times speed 'cause it's gonna be a 5-minute programming challenge
01:27 - I'm already talking really fast
01:28 - so I'm gonna talk really fast in the 5-minute-
01:29 - incoherent mumbling
01:30 - Ok! Now I'm gonna do void draw.
01:32 - And, I'm gonna say size
01:35 - four hundred, four hundred
01:37 - So, I want to have a window that's a square
01:38 - so I don't have to worry about width versus height
01:40 - and maybe we could figure that out later.
01:42 - But I need a random, um-
01:43 - and then I'm also gonna make Z some random value
01:46 - Now you're kind of wondering,
01:47 - "If I have an X and Y and a Z, shouldn't I be in 3-D space?"
01:50 - And, probably I should be in 3-D space, to really create
01:53 - this star-field simulator, but-
01:54 - but- I'm gonna try to do this in 2-D because eventually
01:57 - I wanna port this to Javascript and Canvas and I don' wanna deal
01:59 - with WebGL or 3-D rendering
02:01 - I just wanna kinda create the illusion of stars moving quickly past my face
02:05 - So! Let's keep going here
02:07 - So, now what I wanna do, is I wanna make an array
02:11 - and I could make an ArrayList 'cause I wanna add stars
02:13 - and when they get off the screen I wanna remove them
02:15 - But I'm gonna do something simpler, just gonna have an array of stars
02:22 - I'm gonna put like, a hundred of them in there
02:25 - Um, because I think what might make the most sense
02:30 - is when a star goes off the window
02:33 - to just re-use that same star in the array, but reset it's location back
02:37 - Um, and I'm going to say stars index "i" equals a new star
02:45 - And then in draw, space is what color?
02:51 - The blackness of space, so I will make the black background
02:55 - and I'm just gonna say like, update and draw, display, show
03:00 - I'll just do show
03:02 - So this is the basic outline of the program
03:04 - I make a bunch of stars, I update them and I show them
03:07 - Now these functions don't exist yet, so I need to go back to my star object
03:11 - and I need to say update- how am I doing on time?
03:13 - Six minutes left!
03:14 - I need to say show, and the main thing I wanna do
03:19 - is fill two-fifty-five, no stroke, I wanna draw an ellipse
03:26 - at that X and Y location and I'm gonna make that ellipse just like, eight
03:32 - And I'm gonna run this and make sure this is working
03:34 - Good! Ok! So I do see, a bunch of things that look like they could be stars
03:39 - Now I need to make them move.
03:40 - So they really should move like, they should move-
03:42 - let's kinda move this closer to myself
03:44 - This is bad for me to start talking I really just gotta keep programming
03:46 - But I want them to move like, fanning out from the center
03:49 - and as they go out to the center I want them to go faster and faster
03:52 - And that's what I'm gonna use that Z-value for
03:54 - I'm essentially going to, divide-
03:57 - you could think of-
03:57 - you could think of the ratio of their location from the center to the edge
04:01 - and I wanna divide by some value
04:03 - So their-
04:04 - So that value I'm dividing by is getting bigger and bigger
04:06 - and they're moving out to the edge
04:08 - I think this is gonna work and I saw an example like, a year ago
04:12 - and I'm gonna find that example and link to it in the video
04:14 - 'cause now I'm realizing this is kinda based on that
04:19 - Anyway, I'll find it
04:20 - Ok but I can't talk about it too much right now because I only got five minutes left
04:22 - So what I wanna do is, I wanna say something like this
04:26 - I wanna say, uh-
04:29 - I'm gonna make a new value called like, SX
04:33 - and I wanna say X divided by Z
04:37 - And then I wanna map that value, kind of like a ratio
04:41 - which goes between zero and one
04:44 - to between zero and the width
04:46 - And I want it to do the same thing for Y
04:49 - Y divided by Z
04:52 - Right, because Z-
04:53 - Let's just, like-
04:54 - Let's just pretend they're all starting really far away
04:57 - So, basically what I'm saying is that
05:00 - I want them to start
05:05 - I almost shouldn't use Z, I just used Z because I'm thinking of them as moving closer or farther away
05:10 - but I really want a value between zero and one, and um-
05:18 - Let's run this again
05:21 - And we should see it kinda looks the same
05:22 - but now the difference is, I could say here
05:25 - Z equals Z minus one
05:29 - And- Oh! You know what I've done here that's bad?
05:32 - Everything is happening according to the top left corner
05:35 - This is a terrible- This is- This is a problem, and we've gotta correct this
05:38 - Only got four minutes left
05:40 - So, I can translate in draw, with divided by two, height divided by two
05:45 - This makes a lot more sense because really what I want is to be translating to the, um-
05:50 - I want everything to be fanning out from the center, not the top left
05:53 - So if I do this, you can see, things are fanning out, but still from there
05:57 - So all I need to do now
05:59 - is really think about this as like, negative width to width and negative height to height
06:04 - That should-
06:05 - That should do well, and you can see here, um-
06:08 - And-
06:08 - And, let that-
06:09 - Only, um-
06:11 - A hundred stars wasn't so many, so let's make four hundred
06:14 - And you can see things are moving out from the center
06:17 - and you can see as they move out, they start getting faster and faster and faster, 'cause I'm dividing by this number
06:22 - Ohps! And you can see them now, so they're coming back
06:25 - they're getting sucked in back to the center, and I also divided by zero because I got this Infinity problem
06:30 - So, I need to do a couple things
06:31 - Number one is, um, I need to deal with the fact that when Z, gets down to zero
06:38 - I want to reset Z back to somewhere else, and also let's have them all start at a random Z
06:45 - And then, if Z is-
06:47 - and let's just say less than one because I don't want to divide by zero
06:50 - Z should get a random, actually it should just go all the way back
06:55 - And, you know we could give them a new X and Y also
06:59 - And I could put this into another function, now look at this
07:02 - So now things are moving out, and you could see as they-
07:07 - As they come back, they're-
07:08 - they're re-appearing
07:09 - Now here's another thing I could do
07:11 - First of all, let's make this whole thing bigger
07:15 - And let's make more stars, just to be able to see more
07:20 - So you could see how this is looking, now they're moving kind of slowly
07:23 - So I also think that it would make a lot more sense for this to be like, the number ten
07:28 - And you could see-
07:28 - Ah, there we go we're start-
07:29 - Now we got something that's really starting to look like a star-field, right?
07:33 - You could-
07:33 - But, the thing is they're kind of like popping up, like they just appear
07:36 - So one thing I could do is also change their size, right?
07:39 - If they're farther away they should be small, if they're closer they should be big
07:43 - So, right now the ellipse is always drawn
07:49 - The ellipse is always drawn at-
07:50 - Oh my god I only have two minutes left!
07:52 - The ellipse is always drawn at eight pixels
07:54 - So what I wanna do is make another variable called R
07:57 - And, uh rand-
07:58 - not random, I wanna map they're Z value, which goes between zero and width
08:03 - to when they're-
08:05 - Close, being zero, they should be big, like sixteen
08:09 - And when they're far away, being width, they-
08:12 - They, I shouldn't be able to see them at all
08:14 - And so now, if we do that
08:17 - You can see, they're far away they're small and as they come closer they get bigger and bigger
08:21 - Now this is like a star-field, and let's just-
08:23 - By the way, let's make this really quickly-
08:26 - Woops!
08:27 - Let's make this just like, how Z changes a global variable
08:31 - and let's be able to control that by the mouse
08:33 - So I'm gonna say-
08:35 - I'm gonna add a variable called speed
08:37 - And I'm gonna say, speed equals map, the mouse X, mouse x which goes between zero and width
08:43 - to between zero and, I don't know, twenty?
08:48 - So now I can control the speed, right?
08:49 - As I move the mouse over, I'm moving faster, I'm slowing down, I'm moving faster
08:53 - And I can eventually get to warp speed-
08:54 - And I've got one minute left!
08:56 - 'Cause I wanna do one more thing, I wanna see these streaking
08:58 - I wanna see lines streaking, with one minute left, fifty-nine seconds
09:01 - So what do I need to do, to have them streaking?
09:04 - Well I want their current location and I want their previous location, and I want to connect those things with a line
09:08 - So I'm actually gonna make more variables
09:10 - I'm gonna say PX and PY
09:14 - And, I'm gonna set those variables here to um, PX equals SX, PY equals SY
09:27 - I want to also draw a line-
09:32 - Oh I realize I'm gonna have a problem, and I only have twenty-six seconds left!
09:35 - I'm gonna-
09:35 - Oh g-
09:36 - I can do this!
09:36 - Line PX, PY, SX, SY
09:39 - So, this is fine
09:42 - You can see, there's a problem though which is, when they get to the edge-
09:47 - When they get to the edge-
09:50 - When they get to the edge they're drawing, they're connecting a line to their-
09:54 - To their previous locations, so-
10:02 - So, really what I should be doing is saying, this-
10:09 - What the he-
10:10 - I failed, ok the-
10:13 - You know, whatever
10:13 - So that was the ten minute coding challenge, you should stop now
10:18 - This is really like, so dramatic and exciting and yet I totally failed
10:22 - But I'm gonna-
10:22 - I'm gonna give myself-
10:24 - I'm gonna give myself a bonus two minutes
10:29 - Bonus two minutes
10:34 - Bonus two minutes to solve this problem
10:36 - So I kind of was screwing around here because I was trying to be tricky and get the previous location
10:41 - But really I don't want the previous-
10:42 - I need to keep track-
10:45 - Right, every time
10:48 - The previous location when it starts should just be it's X location
10:52 - And the previous-
10:54 - And then, each time after it moves and I draw it, then I should update it's previous location
10:59 - Then it gets it's new location, but really what I wanna do here
11:04 - For that line
11:06 - Is say, PSX, PSY-
11:10 - And it's not-
11:11 - Oh my goodness, the X doesn't matter
11:14 - The X doesn't-
11:14 - This is the whole problem, it's the Z
11:16 - The Z-
11:17 - All I care about is the previous Z, I knew something was going on here
11:21 - I want previous Z
11:22 - Boy, previous Z because the Z is the only thing that's changing it's X is like it's position in the world
11:28 - The Z is what's actually causing it to change
11:30 - So I want PZ to start-
11:33 - Being previous Z, to start at Z
11:35 - And I wanna draw, and then-
11:37 - The whole point of this-
11:38 - Oh! And the camera goes off!
11:39 - And I have fifty-four seconds left, we're gonna make this happen in my bonus two minutes
11:44 - I gotta-
11:45 - I'm gonna say, here, float-
11:48 - Yeah, yeah, yeah
11:49 - PX equals, and this exact same formula
11:52 - But now, I want X divided by PZ and PY, I want X divided by-
11:58 - Y divided by PZ
12:00 - So now, I'm drawing a line between the two locations
12:03 - We don't care about this, although it's probably a good time here to give it it's previous location also-
12:09 - Whoa, something lunacy is happening, what did I miss?
12:14 - I have nineteen seconds left
12:16 - X, X divided by PZ
12:18 - Oh! Height-
12:19 - No, but that shouldn't matter
12:20 - Oh, X,X
12:21 - Here we go, here we go, here we go!
12:26 - So close, six seconds left what did I miss?
12:29 - PX, Oh SX, SX, SX, SY
12:33 - Here we go!
12:34 - There we go, so you can see now, in all of it's glory the warp speed streaky-ness
12:41 - Boy, it said one second there for awhile 'cause it doesn't actually say time expired, until I click over here
12:47 - Ok
12:49 - Interestingly enough, something is definitely not working, because-
12:55 - Ah! I forgot to say PZ equals Z
13:00 - There we go, so you can see it's streaky-ness
13:03 - Let's make it go faster
13:07 - I'm really failing with the ten minute thing
13:11 - Let's see how long this video is in the end
13:12 - Oh it's only-
13:12 - It can't be more than fifteen minutes otherwise I will really feel like a total failure
13:16 - I'm gonna turn off the ellipse for a second
13:18 - And, here we go this is what I was sort of hoping to see
13:21 - You can see the streaks as it draws the lines
13:23 - And I can slow down, and I can put those circles back in there
13:27 - There's all sorts of possibilities here
13:28 - So, I hope you enjoyed this video about how to make a star-field
13:32 - I'm also going to upload a Javascript version of this that will run in the browser
13:36 - The links to both the code for both of those will be in the description
13:39 - If they're not there, write a comment reminding me
13:41 - And, I will see you in the next edition of Ten-Minute Coding Challenge
13:45 - Which is just probably gonna be fifteen minutes
13:47 - Tweet me with a challenge, I'll keep track of a list of them
13:50 - And I will do it in the next time, ok.
