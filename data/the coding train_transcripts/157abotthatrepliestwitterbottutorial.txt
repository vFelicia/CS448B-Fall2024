00:00 - hello in this video I want to look at
00:02 - how you can make a Twitter bot that
00:03 - replies to other tweets so in all of the
00:06 - previous bot tutorials that I've made so
00:09 - far the tweets happen on a schedule
00:11 - every 5 minutes every 10 minutes once an
00:13 - hour but something that you can do is
00:16 - actually have a bot participate in the
00:17 - conversation it can look for a hashtag
00:19 - it can look for at mentions of its own
00:21 - account it can tweet with so many
00:23 - favorites its tweet you know whatever
00:25 - you can imagine is possible so let's
00:27 - look at one example of that which is a
00:30 - bot that replies to tweets that are sent
00:32 - to that particular bot so what I'm gonna
00:35 - do first is let's just review for a
00:37 - second the Pete what's the sort of core
00:40 - pieces of the Twitter API itself so
00:42 - there is a get request there is a post
00:45 - request and there is a stream request
00:47 - request this may be the wrong word these
00:49 - are the sort of three commands or method
00:52 - calls or endpoints I think one of these
00:54 - terms that you can execute on the API
00:56 - get is something that you might use for
00:58 - like a one-time search so just give me
01:01 - all the tweets with the hashtag rainbow
01:03 - post is the thing to actually like post
01:06 - a tweet to tweet tweet tweet tweet so
01:09 - that's the thing that you tweet how many
01:11 - times can I say tweet in one video count
01:13 - them something like that now this is a
01:16 - sort of new feature that I want to spend
01:18 - some time looking at in this particular
01:20 - video now we saw it before in an example
01:22 - where I used a user stream to see if
01:24 - somebody followed me but so there are a
01:27 - stream is like a continuous connection
01:29 - to Twitter so anytime a certain kind of
01:33 - event happens I want to execute a
01:35 - function in my code so any time somebody
01:37 - posts a tweet with a certain hashtag or
01:39 - any time so an @ mentions me in the
01:40 - tweeter anytime somebody favorites my
01:42 - tweets I want to connect to a stream
01:44 - there are three kinds of streams user
01:47 - public and I think another one's called
01:50 - like site stream I have no idea what the
01:51 - site stream is somebody who understands
01:53 - that write that in the comments but the
01:55 - public stream is where you want to look
01:57 - have an event tied to just the public
01:59 - timeline of Twitter so look for any time
02:02 - so many tweets with a certain hashtag
02:03 - for example you do that with the public
02:04 - stream the user stream or any events
02:07 - that are tied to a particular user
02:09 - this case that user being me so this is
02:11 - what I want to use if somebody acts
02:13 - mentions me in a tweet and there's a
02:15 - difference between an @ reply in an @
02:17 - mention which is sort of a subtle thing
02:18 - but kind of important so if I come back
02:20 - over here what I have now is from one of
02:23 - my previous videos I made a follow bot
02:25 - so this particular Twitter bot connects
02:29 - to a user stream and it sets up a
02:32 - callback called followed for a follow
02:34 - event so this function right here will
02:37 - execute any time somebody follows me but
02:39 - I'm going to change this I want to
02:41 - change it's still a user stream but I
02:42 - want the event to be a tweet event and I
02:46 - don't know it could call I don't know
02:48 - what to call this followed made sense
02:50 - but I'll just call it like tweet event
02:53 - so now I now anytime there is a tweet
02:56 - event I want this function to trigger
02:59 - now the tricky thing here is a tweet
03:02 - event for a particular user encompasses
03:04 - a ton of things so what I need to do is
03:07 - figure out was this actually a tweet
03:09 - that was sent in reply to me so how do I
03:13 - do that
03:13 - now one thing I could do is I could go
03:15 - find the Twitter API website look in the
03:17 - developer documentation because I need
03:19 - to look at all the metadata in this
03:20 - event message variable like that's all
03:22 - the stuff associated with the tweet who
03:24 - sent it what time did they sent it what
03:26 - was the text of their tweet were there
03:27 - any hashtags in the tweet all that kind
03:28 - of stuff so I need to look at the
03:30 - documentation for that the documentation
03:32 - is kind of very stressful it's very hard
03:34 - to look at I post a link to it but
03:37 - here's a little trick that I sometimes
03:38 - do and I'm just gonna pull this code
03:40 - from a previous example not a previous
03:42 - example another example that I have
03:43 - preset I have three lines of code right
03:45 - here that I'm copying over in and look
03:48 - at them let's look at them and examine
03:49 - them so I'm gonna also take this out and
03:53 - put this in and put this in this is sort
03:56 - of extraneous code sorry so what this is
03:59 - doing is this is using a node module
04:01 - called FF file system it allows you to
04:04 - read and write book files from your
04:05 - local hard drive and I'm also taking the
04:08 - what i'm doing here is i'm taking this
04:10 - event message and i'm using json
04:13 - stringify which is a way of taking a
04:15 - javascript object and turning it into a
04:17 - string because what I ultimately want to
04:19 - do is write that out to a file tweet
04:21 - JSON so this way I'm not doing them this
04:24 - is nothing to do with making with the
04:26 - but running the bot itself this is
04:28 - purely for me to figure out like what's
04:30 - all that stuff because I could just look
04:32 - at I could look at the Twitter
04:33 - documentation or I could say console dot
04:35 - log event message but if I say that all
04:39 - of this nonsense is gonna be in the
04:41 - terminal window it's gonna be impossible
04:42 - to wade through so I find writing it to
04:44 - a file is kind of useful so I'm gonna
04:46 - run this particular bot whoops it's
04:50 - actually hard your project I'm gonna run
04:52 - it you can see it says the reply er bot
04:54 - is starting and then if somebody is
04:56 - watching live you can tweet at a twosie
04:58 - ITP but I'm just gonna go do it over
05:01 - from my account now fortunately I kind
05:03 - of already did this earlier so you can
05:05 - see that there is a tweet JSON file this
05:08 - is actually would have just appeared out
05:09 - of thin air when that tweet was sent but
05:13 - so I'm gonna look now in that file and
05:15 - you can see ah there it is now I'm gonna
05:16 - whoop so I'm gonna quickly stop the bot
05:19 - so except although it would be fun to
05:21 - see this live update as other people
05:22 - tweet to me but you can see here now
05:25 - this is all of the metadata associated
05:27 - with that particular tweet you can see
05:29 - the tweet is from me Daniel Schiffman
05:31 - you can see the tweet goes to oh that's
05:33 - my URL you can see that's mine anyway
05:36 - there's all this information about the
05:37 - user that sent that tweet this is a key
05:39 - thing in reply to screen name this was a
05:42 - tweet sent to at a twosie ITP so if I
05:46 - want to only look for tweets that were
05:48 - sent to me then that's what I want to do
05:50 - now by the way this is a difference here
05:52 - is if if the tweet if I if my username
05:55 - is the first thing and the tweet I know
05:57 - it's tricky you're like my username I
05:58 - have two usernames in this situation
06:00 - because I sent it to myself but the bot
06:02 - is a twosie ITP and I should name it
06:05 - coding rainbow bot but and me this like
06:08 - third party person who doesn't exist
06:10 - inside this in this room but is me still
06:12 - to say I know I'm talking about
06:14 - that's the person who's sent to tweet so
06:16 - my to the tweet that Daniel Schiffman
06:19 - I'm talking about ourselves the third
06:20 - person set to me the bot because I have
06:22 - the bot is this that's what I'm looking
06:26 - at the data for it so it was in reply to
06:28 - the bot hoz ITP but if I scroll down
06:31 - here there's something called entities
06:32 - and you can see here is also a list of
06:34 - you
06:35 - our mentions so if that tweet mentioned
06:37 - other people or if the tweet mentioned
06:39 - eight to Z ITP but not is the very first
06:42 - part of the tweet you would see it over
06:44 - here so okay so that was a little bit
06:45 - long-winded but this is the kind of
06:47 - thing now you could you could spend your
06:48 - Sunday afternoon reading this JSON file
06:51 - because there's tons of information in
06:52 - there location all sorts of metadata
06:54 - associated with the tweet but all I
06:56 - really care about is in reply to screen
06:58 - name for the moment so what I want to do
07:01 - is go back to my code and I want I don't
07:03 - need to write that file anymore the file
07:05 - is there and I want to just say first
07:07 - okay like so reply to equals event
07:10 - message dot in reply to screen name so I
07:13 - want to pull that piece of data out and
07:14 - while we're here why don't I also pull
07:17 - the the text of the tweet itself so I'll
07:21 - say that if you was in event message
07:23 - text if you look here right this is the
07:26 - actual text at ages zero and you know
07:29 - what I want I want who it's from user
07:31 - dot screen underscore name so I also
07:34 - want to know who the tweet is from from
07:37 - equals user oh sorry
07:39 - event message dot user screen underscore
07:43 - name
07:43 - so again if reading through JSON files
07:45 - is new to you let me refer you to one of
07:47 - my previous videos about learning the
07:50 - JSON format and how to go through JSON
07:52 - format I'll try to have a link to that I
07:53 - asked me in the comments if I don't but
07:55 - this is the kind of thing you need to do
07:56 - it's detective work about figuring out
07:58 - how to get the data that you want out of
08:00 - a particular JSON file so now all I want
08:03 - to do is say let's say I want to send
08:05 - replies back I only want to send a reply
08:08 - back if this was in fact a tweet that
08:11 - was sent to me and what might I say I
08:14 - might say new tweet equals at whoever
08:21 - this was from thank you for tweeting me
08:25 - coding rainbow so you can see here I'm
08:30 - just creating anytime that somebody sent
08:33 - a tweet to me I'm sending a tweet back
08:35 - to them and then I already have from the
08:37 - previous examples this function that I
08:39 - could call tweet it with some text and
08:40 - it just sends that out so I can now say
08:44 - tweet it the new tweet
08:49 - and I gotta use the same variable name
08:50 - there it is so now let's go back and run
08:53 - this if anybody is watching I'm gonna do
08:56 - this myself but tweaked at a twosie ITP
08:59 - and you know what just let's be a little
09:01 - bit more methodical about this let's do
09:03 - put console dot log reply reply to and
09:08 - then from so we can at least see the
09:12 - tweets who they came who sent to it
09:15 - should be me and who it's from so and
09:17 - you'll notice I'm not putting that
09:20 - inside the if statement so there's gonna
09:21 - be a lot more events than just the
09:23 - events that are particularly pleased to
09:25 - this particular user okay so let me run
09:27 - this it's going so now we have to wait
09:31 - we don't have to wait I'm gonna come
09:32 - over here and tweet it myself again a
09:34 - twosie ITP hello is this working please
09:39 - say it is working and I'm gonna send
09:42 - that tweet and that tweet was sent it
09:46 - worked
09:47 - ah so you see a tweet other people are
09:49 - tweeting and you can see that the tweets
09:51 - are going back so I you know let's look
09:53 - on Twitter just to like see that this is
09:55 - happening so you can see I have you can
09:58 - see here that I'm going into the replies
10:00 - that Benjamin Hobart thank you for doing
10:03 - that I sent to thank you for tweeting at
10:05 - me reply to a particular tweet that
10:09 - Benjamin Hobart sent I don't know why
10:12 - it's not showing up in the conversation
10:13 - I'll go to and you can see you can see
10:16 - here what would you do if I put a swear
10:18 - word in this that's a good question so
10:19 - this opens up I mean that's the perfect
10:21 - question to ask right now
10:22 - so I haven't really done anything other
10:24 - than like essentially like hello world
10:26 - replying bot because I'm just saying
10:28 - thank you for treating me like I'm some
10:29 - sort of like horrible spamming you know
10:32 - marketing robot just to like always say
10:34 - thank you but ultimately what you might
10:37 - want to do is make use of what's in that
10:39 - text variable so if somebody tweets at
10:42 - you perhaps they tweet a few key words
10:44 - you go look those words up in the word
10:45 - Nick API I have a video about the word
10:47 - that KPI and you send them back a poem
10:49 - using those words or you know as an
10:52 - exercise one of my examples which I'll
10:53 - post along with this is I take their
10:55 - tweet and I reverse all the characters
10:57 - and I send it back so that's like the
10:59 - reverse text box basically so I'm you
11:02 - watching this I
11:03 - are a very creative person with lots of
11:05 - ideas I don't have any good ideas right
11:07 - now but you can see how this gives you
11:09 - the framework and what I would like to
11:11 - do in the next video which may be but
11:13 - might might not be told hopefully will
11:15 - be soon as soon as I can get to making
11:16 - it we'll look at what if somebody tweets
11:18 - at me not just text but an image can i
11:21 - download that image process that image
11:23 - and send it back ok so thanks for
11:26 - watching this particular video another
11:28 - addition to the set of Twitter bot
11:31 - tutorials and have a long list of topics
11:34 - that I hope to get to and hope to be
11:35 - able to have a longer session sometimes
11:36 - see where I make more of them I don't
11:38 - know why I'm including this in this
11:39 - video you should have stopped watching
11:40 - it by now and hit stop
11:46 - [Music]
11:53 - you
