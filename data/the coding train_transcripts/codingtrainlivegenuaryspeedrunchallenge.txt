05:31 - [Music]
05:34 - thank you
05:41 - well hello everybody
05:44 - I'm a strange color
05:47 - hold on a second
05:50 - I really thought
05:52 - I had fixed everything and I'm gonna go
05:54 - to this camera and I'm just gonna put it
05:58 - on auto white balance
06:02 - Auto white balance okay hopefully that's
06:06 - going to make everything better
06:09 - hello happy Sunday welcome to a live
06:14 - episode of the coding train with me your
06:17 - host Dan wearing my Baltimore Orioles
06:20 - cap and really really just not sure at
06:24 - all
06:25 - if this is a good idea or not but I am
06:28 - going to Jump Right In let me just sort
06:30 - of like take a look at the chat
06:33 - um yeah I don't know what's going on
06:35 - with my camera settings maybe I look
06:37 - okay now uh maybe the lights a little
06:39 - bright I'm not going to get worried
06:41 - about it too much uh Raphael is in the
06:45 - chat Rafael Sable Ralph Sable wrath
06:47 - Sable Rafe
06:48 - is the inspiration for today although to
06:51 - be honest I did have this idea in my
06:54 - head although I would never have thought
06:56 - to call it a speed run or thought about
06:59 - it as like a thing just kind of like oh
07:02 - hey I'm not really having time for this
07:04 - January thing let me see if I could just
07:06 - do a live stream and like do a whole
07:07 - bunch of them that was as far as I had
07:09 - thought then I saw Rafael who has a
07:12 - wonderful twitch stream I think there's
07:14 - a link in the video description that you
07:15 - should check out he may actually be live
07:17 - streaming right now I'm not sure uh
07:20 - creative coding news and the weekly
07:22 - coding challenge so much stuff wonderful
07:24 - stuff going on there
07:26 - um that he is doing so you should
07:27 - definitely check out
07:29 - um Raphael's twitch stream so but I'm
07:31 - here
07:32 - to attempt
07:33 - uh you know what I think is a Young
07:35 - Person's game and I I am not a young
07:38 - person no more I was at one point in my
07:42 - life but when I was young there was no
07:44 - YouTube there really was no YouTube I
07:47 - had no way of bringing myself to you the
07:51 - viewers that I do now so I just have to
07:53 - do it as an old person and
07:56 - most of the time that involves me
07:58 - falling flat on my face and yet
08:00 - here we are again so you might not have
08:02 - seen me in a while I've been I've been
08:04 - kind of experimenting with YouTube
08:06 - shorts I know people love short form
08:08 - videos you can see it in the comments
08:10 - nobody ever has a negative thing to say
08:12 - about a short
08:14 - um but um which has been sort of a fun
08:16 - experiment I hope to do more of that I
08:18 - have a lot of ideas for them I just
08:19 - haven't figured out a kind of way of
08:21 - getting it into a regular weekly
08:23 - workflow a huge thanks to Bernie uh who
08:27 - has been working on the editing and
08:29 - production along with a creative team of
08:31 - folks that he works with
08:34 - um you know you can find out more about
08:35 - that if you check out my Twitter feed if
08:37 - you can bear to go on Twitter which I
08:39 - barely can these days but I'm still
08:41 - using it because I don't know what else
08:43 - to use YouTube Community posts
08:47 - anyway
08:48 - um
08:49 - ah so I I have a um I was on a year
08:52 - sabbatical and I had this whole list of
08:54 - projects and my sabbaticals now over and
08:56 - I'm still trying to do those projects
08:58 - one of which is a new full start to
09:01 - finish learn to code with processing
09:03 - complete beginner series I've recorded
09:06 - maybe a third of it now
09:09 - um hopefully you know certainly by the
09:11 - end of February I would hope that it
09:12 - would be out so that's kind of why I
09:14 - haven't been making new content because
09:15 - I'm recording this it's just gonna come
09:17 - out as one three or four hour Chunk on
09:21 - YouTube
09:22 - um I'm working on the nature of code
09:23 - book it did not hit my deadline but I am
09:25 - making progress without I would talk
09:27 - about all these things like I usually do
09:28 - on a live stream but we don't have time
09:30 - for that today
09:32 - um to Fox the bomb ass do I wear shorts
09:35 - in the winter well guess what I wore
09:38 - shorts today outside because I am now uh
09:40 - training for the Brooklyn half marathon
09:42 - which is on May 20th I had my first day
09:45 - of training today and that was like an
09:47 - easy two mile jog
09:49 - um and
09:51 - um
09:52 - uh yeah I wear shorts It's not that it's
09:55 - not that chilly today it's in the 40s in
09:57 - Fahrenheit that is
09:58 - okay
10:00 - um
10:02 - so I I'm reading the chat and I'm
10:06 - reading the comments what about Mastodon
10:08 - I have attempted it I have made
10:10 - tutorials in Mastodon I have a mastodon
10:12 - account
10:13 - I don't know I just haven't had um the
10:16 - time to really
10:18 - fully just just to like sort of move
10:21 - myself to a new platform I don't I
10:23 - barely use this stuff anyway so but yes
10:25 - I in in theory Mastodon is the perfect
10:29 - place for me and yet I can't seem to
10:31 - manage to do it
10:33 - um all right so
10:36 - go Seb for the London 10K
10:39 - I did actually run the London marathon
10:41 - is that the shirt that I'm wearing no
10:44 - this is a I got a a New York City
10:46 - marathon I have run three marathons I
10:48 - don't think I will ever do that again
10:50 - but a half marathon is I feel like a
10:52 - perfectly reasonable goal at my age and
10:55 - abilities
10:57 - um okay so
10:59 - um uh thank you Rafael for the if I
11:02 - point this way right for the live split
11:04 - that's showing up here let's move over
11:06 - here
11:07 - um I'm I don't know whether to use
11:08 - processing or P5 or something else even
11:10 - I just kind of have processing open
11:12 - let's go to the browser
11:15 - um I did make a repo a GitHub repo where
11:18 - I intend to and I would love help with
11:22 - this where I intend to document
11:24 - everything I do today here but I'm not
11:26 - going to do it while I'm coding so I'm
11:28 - gonna have to do this after the fact and
11:31 - anybody who wants to help with that I
11:32 - mean it's certainly uh you know help
11:35 - with it like pull request I don't know
11:37 - if it would make sense for you to like
11:38 - pull request stuff while I'm going or
11:39 - file issues but um yeah
11:43 - um all right lots of wonderful questions
11:44 - in the chat we don't got time for this
11:45 - today because Raphael completed this in
11:48 - five hours and 48 minutes
11:50 - and if I'm still here 5 hours and 48 for
11:53 - minutes from now we've got a big problem
11:55 - because I cannot stream for you know
11:58 - I've got children who need to have
12:00 - dinner uh do their homework I've got a
12:04 - dog who needs to be walked so
12:06 - I think that if I could go ease I could
12:10 - certainly go for two and a half hours
12:14 - um
12:15 - so
12:17 - let's see how it goes all right so just
12:20 - to talk about what this is if you're not
12:23 - familiar January
12:25 - January is a artificially generated
12:29 - month of time where we the community of
12:32 - people of the of Earth I don't know
12:35 - maybe the aliens or the aliens doing
12:36 - January build code that makes beautiful
12:39 - things I will not be making beautiful
12:41 - things today I will be building code
12:43 - over 744 hours for every 24 hours
12:46 - there's a new prompt you don't have to
12:48 - follow the prompt exactly or even at all
12:50 - but you know we put effort into this any
12:52 - language free framework or medium on any
12:55 - Planet see the millions are
12:58 - the aliens are doing January made of
13:00 - hashtags uh so you can do all that stuff
13:03 - tips and tricks so uh and then there are
13:06 - prompts so I'm going to start with
13:09 - January one you can see I have the live
13:10 - split thing here going it if it all goes
13:13 - according to plan as soon as I hit this
13:14 - key over here it will start when I
13:16 - finish this one I hit the key it goes on
13:18 - to the next one
13:20 - um let's set up some rules for myself
13:21 - let's I have a new whiteboard camera so
13:25 - I might as well come over here let's
13:26 - make up some rules and I'm um
13:31 - um
13:31 - um okay there is life split does have a
13:33 - pause but I don't tend to use it okay
13:36 - rule number one
13:38 - no rules
13:42 - who cares this is just for fun for
13:45 - educational slash entertainment purposes
13:48 - you pick one of those if it's both then
13:51 - boy I could just retire and this is the
13:53 - last live stream I will ever do no rules
13:55 - two
13:57 - um I but but if there were rules
14:00 - I can start
14:03 - from a coding challenge
14:06 - or any coding train video so I can start
14:09 - from any example that I've previously
14:10 - made but I don't want to just take the
14:14 - example and say I'm done
14:16 - so what is a threshold I must at least
14:19 - at least
14:22 - change
14:24 - uh one uh Behavior
14:29 - a behavior or visual element
14:36 - mildly
14:37 - significantly that's not proper English
14:40 - but you get the idea
14:42 - somebody I can ask chat GPT to clean
14:45 - that up for me
14:47 - um I am done
14:50 - uh prompt
14:53 - is complete
14:56 - when
14:58 - I see
15:01 - um
15:02 - uh uh what's a good Emoji for the chat
15:05 - the train emoji
15:07 - you can flood the chat with train emojis
15:11 - if you think I'm good to go or
15:13 - if I say so
15:18 - uh
15:20 - quantity
15:24 - over quality
15:26 - I'm trying to get through the whole
15:28 - thing they're not going to be brilliant
15:30 - they're not going to be sophisticated
15:32 - they're not going to be beautiful
15:33 - they're just going to be a thing that I
15:36 - did and like if you think about it if
15:38 - we're talking to let's say two hours 120
15:41 - Minutes
15:42 - that's like four minutes per prompt if
15:44 - there's 30 prompts there's 31 prompt but
15:46 - technically I could just do up to 29.
15:48 - since that's today and I could do the
15:50 - other two but it wouldn't be the full
15:51 - speed run all right I'm gonna go look at
15:53 - the chat to see if anybody has anything
15:54 - to say about these rules
15:59 - is that is that even in Focus I don't
16:01 - know but you get the idea okay
16:04 - um
16:06 - so
16:08 - uh okay
16:10 - um
16:12 - mildly significant digits is the name of
16:15 - my next band says Chris
16:19 - um
16:19 - uh Yaz hire yazarax asks been under a
16:24 - rock for a while welcome back I hope you
16:26 - had a nice time under your rock
16:29 - I'm on the wrong screen uh here we are
16:32 - um and
16:34 - um do you have any open AI videos yet uh
16:37 - not really I made one short which is
16:40 - kind of like a bit of a jokey thing with
16:42 - chat gbt and I have been working on a
16:46 - lot of experiments uh fine-tuning gpt3
16:49 - to my own bizarre tastes
16:53 - um and I've been enjoying that but I
16:56 - haven't made any videos about it yet
16:59 - okay anybody have anything they must say
17:05 - um before
17:08 - um do I take a drink of coffee every
17:10 - time you say oops rule number five I
17:13 - like that anybody else have anything
17:15 - else they want to say should I I will
17:19 - you indulge me with one plug
17:21 - um
17:22 - I have been working a lot with the
17:24 - wonderful streaming service called
17:25 - nebula and I have a new page on nebula
17:30 - um which is right here if you go to
17:34 - go.nebula.tv codingtrain this is a paid
17:37 - service it is a way of supporting the
17:38 - coding train uh I uh anybody who signs
17:41 - up to the coding train I I I'm a
17:43 - co-owner of nebula and there's a revenue
17:45 - sharing thing but I you know I'm I'm
17:47 - really interested in alternatives to
17:49 - YouTube and I think there's a lot of
17:50 - wonderful things about this platform
17:51 - that I can go on and on about in
17:53 - particular
17:55 - um all of these amazing originals and
17:58 - classes uh original content some really
18:00 - fantastic
18:01 - um so if you like sort of documentaries
18:03 - and educational content science if you
18:06 - like movies you're gonna find stuff
18:07 - Patrick Williams glasses this thumbnail
18:10 - is like this is like I aspire to make a
18:13 - thumbnail as good as this someday
18:16 - um so anyway please check that out if
18:18 - you're interested I made a class uh
18:19 - using an apple II that you would get it
18:21 - I I used to talk about this as a bundle
18:24 - with curiosity stream no
18:26 - forget about I mean curiosity stream
18:28 - great go sign up for curiosity stream
18:29 - I'm now encouraging people to actually
18:31 - just sign up for nebula directly it is
18:33 - four dollars a month with the discount
18:35 - if you go through
18:37 - um this link okay I just wanted to
18:39 - mention that as my little plug thank you
18:40 - for that Indulgence now
18:44 - are you ready
18:46 - are we ready I see kvikbon is in the
18:50 - chat
18:52 - uh excellent I always like to have some
18:54 - moderators in the chat that are helping
18:55 - me out all right
18:57 - it's also cold in here because I I ran
19:00 - the heat I got this very loud uh heater
19:02 - because I'm in a garage it's just like
19:04 - an electric fan thing that hangs from
19:06 - the ceiling but I turned it off to
19:08 - stream so I might have to turn it on at
19:10 - some point if it gets too cold are you
19:12 - ready for this
19:18 - uh uh I should put on some music I feel
19:20 - like one thing also is I might try to do
19:23 - some of this without talking through it
19:25 - so much because uh it'll help you go
19:28 - faster and it'll also save my voice I'm
19:30 - back teaching again at NYU this semester
19:32 - I gave a presentation yesterday I'm
19:34 - streaming today I want to record videos
19:35 - tomorrow I've got to teach Wednesday and
19:36 - Thursday I have a problem losing my
19:38 - voice I should probably go to like a
19:40 - vocal coach
19:42 - to make sure I'm breathing and speaking
19:44 - correctly but um yeah so here we go
19:46 - everybody
20:04 - this would be really sad if this doesn't
20:06 - work
20:07 - ah shoot okay wait do I come on I set up
20:10 - my uh hotkeys
20:12 - number lock one go there we go okay here
20:16 - we go uh the timer's going okay perfect
20:20 - Loop infinite Loop endless gifts okay
20:22 - this would actually be a good time to
20:24 - use P5 because of the new safe get fun
20:27 - until I get into the B5 web editor hell
20:31 - okay uh let's name this so we can find
20:34 - all these later January 1.
20:37 - all right
20:39 - um
20:40 - I did a whole like short about save
20:42 - gifts let's go to save gif
20:46 - uh save GIF function no no no no no no
20:49 - no no no no no no
20:52 - um this is like the greatest thing ever
20:53 - uh let's let's do this
20:56 - okay
20:58 - um I'm gonna bring this copy pasting
21:01 - code from anywhere on the Internet is
21:04 - also okay
21:05 - just asking chat GPT to do it for me
21:08 - though not okay
21:11 - um okay I have my limits people okay
21:14 - save GIF five seconds buddy I want it to
21:16 - be a looping GIF so I want it to be
21:18 - frames there's a way that I do this it
21:22 - tells me here
21:24 - um duration options options can have a
21:29 - delay
21:31 - a string that can either be seconds or
21:34 - frames
21:35 - huh
21:37 - an optional object that can contain two
21:40 - or more arguments delay units okay
21:44 - so I want it to be like
21:47 - some number of frames and I want the
21:50 - units to be
21:52 - frames
21:55 - and let's say
21:57 - uh
21:58 - frames equals make a variable
22:04 - like like 360 frames I don't know what's
22:06 - going on here uh let's have an angle
22:11 - and then let's say uh angle mode degrees
22:18 - angle equals angle plus one all right so
22:22 - now we just need to do something with
22:23 - like sine or cosine
22:26 - um let's do line from okay let's do
22:31 - translate I I really have no idea what
22:34 - I'm doing here
22:35 - making this up as I go I wish I could
22:37 - look at the chat to get good suggestions
22:39 - uh translate to negative width divided
22:42 - by two
22:44 - zero with divided by 2 comma zero I
22:47 - don't okay let's just see let's put on
22:49 - auto refresh which is dangerous because
22:52 - okay so that's good I like this
22:55 - um let's say background zero with let's
22:56 - put some Alpha in there oh let's make
22:59 - that a variable like let r equal with
23:01 - divided by two
23:04 - negative r
23:07 - our stroke weight 4 stroke 255
23:13 - all right I've got a line uh let's have
23:16 - that be times cosine of the angle
23:20 - okay I like this and now let's also uh
23:24 - rotate by that angle
23:31 - okay yeah this is good it's a good start
23:34 - I've got something going here
23:36 - dude
23:38 - [Music]
23:40 - now the thing is if I'm doing this
23:42 - background thing
23:44 - I have a feeling it's not gonna like
23:46 - look like it's looping done still done
23:49 - yes I agree but the thing is so now I
23:51 - need to hit s all right let's see what
23:54 - happens
23:57 - delay parameter must be a number oh I
23:59 - forgot
24:01 - delay parameter must be a number it is a
24:03 - number 360. did I not do that right
24:07 - uh duration
24:10 - delay oh I have to have a delay
24:13 - okay
24:14 - uh
24:16 - come on delay
24:19 - zero
24:22 - okay
24:25 - and go
24:30 - all right let's get our gif
24:35 - okay downloading my gif
24:48 - I don't understand how that worked but
24:49 - it did awesome I'm done
24:52 - boom that was four minutes and 38
24:54 - seconds take that
24:57 - January
24:59 - that they're not my you're my friend
25:01 - January so take that just yay thank you
25:03 - okay prompt number two that was awesome
25:05 - okay
25:06 - prompt number two yeah four minutes
25:08 - that's what I got to do to get done in
25:09 - two and a half hours uh prompt
25:12 - made it ten minutes
25:19 - all right I have an idea let's just make
25:23 - a timer
25:24 - okay let's uh let's do a new sketch
25:29 - we're gonna call it January 2. did you
25:33 - all know that P5 has a Dom Library see
25:35 - this is my excuse for just doing
25:36 - something very basic which is that I'm
25:37 - going to teach you something
25:39 - um let's say no canvas
25:44 - let's go over here into style and say uh
25:48 - background
25:50 - color
25:53 - that should give me
25:55 - uh there we go
25:58 - um let's get rid of draw let's make a um
26:03 - timer
26:04 - which will be a oh I can I don't I'm
26:07 - just doing all this in setup so
26:11 - timer equals create p
26:14 - uh ten zero zero okay
26:18 - okay there we go then let's say timer
26:21 - uh also let's let's get rid of whoops
26:24 - one thing about Auto refresh is it will
26:26 - always I mean um
26:28 - Auto refresh will take you all the ways
26:31 - to sketch.js which I don't love let's
26:32 - get rid of margin and padding canvas is
26:35 - nothing we need to look at worry about
26:37 - okay
26:41 - uh timer
26:43 - uh uh Style
26:46 - font size you can apply CSS directly in
26:49 - P5
26:52 - through the um so I can create a HTML
26:55 - paragraph element I can apply CSS
26:58 - directly in P5 did you know that you
27:00 - could do this
27:01 - and now let's do a let timer equals so
27:08 - 10 minutes time see this is my loose
27:10 - interpretation of the idea 10 minutes
27:13 - times 60 Seconds
27:16 - because there's 60 seconds per minute
27:18 - and so then uh
27:22 - we're gonna say oh whoa whoa whoa whoa
27:26 - ah no no this is let timer paragraph
27:29 - timer
27:31 - paragraph style and the actual timer is
27:34 - going to start with this then I'm going
27:37 - to say set interval
27:40 - function
27:42 - timer minus minus
27:45 - timer P dot HTML timer
27:49 - and then a comma
27:53 - 1000 every second it will go down by one
27:56 - this is a terrible way of doing this but
27:58 - let's see what happens
28:02 - so this is going to count down 600
28:05 - seconds
28:06 - laughs
28:08 - I would like to change this to convert
28:11 - it to minutes and seconds I think we
28:13 - could do that I think we can manage that
28:15 - okay
28:17 - um
28:18 - so minutes
28:20 - equals timer divided by 60.
28:25 - floor
28:27 - and then seconds would equal timer
28:31 - modulo 60.
28:35 - and then I could say
28:39 - minute colon
28:42 - seconds and this is what's known as a
28:44 - string literal
28:49 - okay what did I get wrong here
28:51 - oh set no seconds
28:54 - and let's have it start like this
29:03 - no I have an error oh timer needs to be
29:06 - a string then oh no no oh I see it has
29:08 - to be
29:09 - oh I see but I can just do this
29:12 - okay
29:16 - great I mean the thing that I don't like
29:18 - here though is I want to number format
29:20 - this
29:23 - I'm taking up way too much time
29:25 - will this work
29:28 - I would like my auto Refresh on now
29:30 - please
29:35 - yep
29:39 - uh how do I set the font style font
29:43 - family
29:45 - Courier
29:48 - there we go
29:51 - this is not made in 10 minutes but this
29:54 - is a very quick timer in 10 minutes done
29:58 - I'm going for quantity not quality okay
30:01 - um
30:03 - okay so by the way uh if set interval is
30:07 - unfamiliar to you it is a way of saying
30:09 - execute a particular function which I've
30:11 - made an anonymous function in here every
30:13 - number of milliseconds that's a string
30:16 - literal which is a way of making a
30:17 - string of text out of
30:19 - [Music]
30:20 - um
30:21 - uh characters and values of variables
30:24 - number formats a great way to format
30:25 - numbers all right this is good okay
30:28 - moving on
30:30 - uh
30:32 - glitch art oh I like this glitch art
30:35 - this should be this shouldn't be too
30:37 - hard okay
30:38 - uh all right everybody let's uh
30:42 - glitch let's glitch a photo
30:50 - okay can I uh air drop this now this is
30:54 - a terrible photo of myself
30:57 - [Music]
30:57 - um
30:58 - all right this is silly
31:00 - Let's find let's let's uh let's get
31:03 - Gloria Gloria Gloria pickle
31:07 - no no
31:09 - I aspire
31:12 - to have really awesome SEO for Gloria
31:15 - pickle images okay I'm gonna have to
31:19 - I'm just gonna go over here while I dig
31:21 - up a picture of Gloria pickle
31:24 - um so just take a second I'm just gonna
31:26 - log into a different
31:27 - Google account
31:30 - for myself
31:32 - a search Gloria pickle
31:38 - and let's find a wonderfully cute
31:42 - picture of Gloria pickle I do like this
31:45 - one
31:47 - I think I could show this to you all
31:49 - it's just lots of beautiful pictures of
31:51 - Gloria pickle
31:53 - um but um I'm gonna pick one
31:56 - this one looks good
31:59 - uh download let's do this in processing
32:02 - okay everybody I feel like pixel stuff
32:04 - for me is a little bit easier in
32:06 - processing
32:07 - and this should be the picture that I
32:09 - downloaded oh going to processing Okay
32:12 - so
32:13 - what am I on January day three
32:17 - is this three okay
32:26 - oh no
32:32 - okay so uh downloads
32:37 - there we go
32:44 - whoops no no come on give me that give
32:47 - me a DOT there
32:48 - I cannot see
32:51 - okay uh also this is a huge file which
32:55 - is just going to cause US problems
32:57 - uh also let's let's crop it
33:07 - um 600 by 505 beautiful
33:11 - okay
33:12 - um
33:18 - size
33:21 - oh I think by the way I so I think in
33:24 - processing
33:25 - if I want to use
33:28 - a like the size of an image to be the
33:30 - size of the canvas I can use the
33:32 - settings functions and then I can say
33:34 - gloria.with
33:36 - gloria.height
33:38 - I don't think I need anything in setup
33:40 - but just let's draw image Gloria
33:43 - zero zero
33:47 - okay what happened what's wrong here
33:49 - people
33:51 - gloria.jpg
34:00 - the sketch path is not set
34:02 - oh interesting uh oh I'm so confused all
34:06 - right I'm gonna I'm gonna worry about
34:07 - this later
34:11 - and
34:15 - oh I never no I did load the image okay
34:19 - let's not get too fancy here
34:28 - what have I done
34:35 - January three
34:40 - I'm looking at the chat I'm looking at
34:42 - the chat
34:45 - uh oh Joseph these are good ideas
34:48 - I didn't see them until just now
34:52 - um
34:54 - what's going on here
34:57 - let's try this again
35:07 - I mean it really shouldn't matter but
35:10 - fine
35:11 - you want to be like that let's be like
35:14 - that
35:15 - yeah okay I'm not sure why I'm I I
35:19 - thought there was no issue in
35:21 - processing with loading an image outside
35:23 - of setup and draw but I guess I'm
35:25 - confused about that
35:27 - um but we're all good here
35:30 - um okay so this should do the trick
35:35 - okay here we go
35:38 - um all right so now we need to make some
35:40 - glitch art
35:43 - uh I want to glitch the image I have an
35:47 - idea
35:48 - let's just say
35:50 - um in draw
35:52 - I am going to pick a random X
36:01 - and a random y
36:09 - this is not going to be very exciting I
36:11 - can already tell this is not the
36:13 - greatest idea ever but let's try it I'm
36:15 - going to pick two random spots I'm going
36:18 - to get color one
36:19 - uh
36:22 - I'm gonna do the quick and dirty way of
36:25 - getting
36:27 - a pixel from an image
36:30 - and then I'm going to say
36:33 - uh Gloria dot set X X1 y1 C2
36:39 - Gloria dot set
36:42 - X
36:45 - 2 Y 2 C 1. and then image Gloria zero
36:52 - zero
36:53 - so I'm this should swap two pixels and
36:57 - now it's doing one pixel at a time
37:00 - however many times through draw
37:04 - [Laughter]
37:06 - let's just see uh if
37:09 - I do a hundred pixels at a time if this
37:12 - is actually happening I shouldn't have
37:14 - to do update pixels
37:16 - because
37:19 - oh yeah
37:22 - so it probably would make more sense for
37:24 - me to actually
37:26 - now this is just it has the appearance
37:28 - of adding noise to Gloria which I kind
37:31 - of like if I had more of a logic to how
37:34 - I was
37:36 - swapping the pixels that would be better
37:41 - um what if
37:43 - I were to always say something like this
37:50 - and Y2 equals y1 like with like if I
37:55 - swap them always like
38:00 - uh that's you know maybe slightly more
38:03 - interesting but not really
38:05 - I guess I should do like
38:07 - this is done though
38:09 - you can I'm sure this could get much
38:11 - better with more time we're already at
38:13 - like 20 minutes what prompt am I on I'm
38:15 - on prompt three so I'm not I gotta move
38:18 - on okay next one that's my glitch art
38:20 - quantity over quality
38:24 - intersections I'm excited about this one
38:27 - okay intersections
38:30 - um yeah I should not have just smeared
38:31 - the pixels that would have been better
38:32 - or like taking whole slices out using
38:34 - copy using copy would have been way
38:36 - better but I had this idea of just
38:37 - swapping pixels it wasn't a good idea
38:39 - but I'm moving on okay uh intersections
38:42 - oh this is going to be great oh I'm
38:44 - going to love this one okay let's go to
38:48 - uh examples and let's pick something
38:50 - from nature of code
38:52 - um just because
38:55 - um I said I I I like the idea of
38:58 - starting from scratch but
39:00 - um you know what there's something kind
39:01 - of nice about starting from scratch but
39:03 - I'm going to stick in processing
39:05 - um
39:07 - my good old my old friend
39:10 - bubble
39:12 - which has an X and A Y
39:14 - and an R
39:24 - okay
39:26 - is my bubble
39:28 - we're gonna uh can't call Float what's
39:31 - another word for float rise
39:35 - y equals y minus some random amount x
39:41 - equals X Plus
39:43 - some random amount
39:45 - uh
39:47 - R equals some random
39:51 - amount
39:53 - and then
39:56 - we're going to draw it as a you'll see
40:00 - we'll see what I'm doing here it's gonna
40:01 - be very exciting
40:03 - um
40:05 - uh
40:07 - uh Circle
40:09 - x y r times two
40:11 - a stroke 255.
40:13 - no fill for the moment okay
40:16 - um now oops uh so this is
40:21 - cancel oh January
40:24 - January
40:26 - what am I on for January 4 okay
40:30 - uh actually let's put this on another
40:33 - tab
40:35 - called Bubble
40:38 - and set up
40:43 - draw
41:22 - okay let's see if I did I do this right
41:24 - yeah all right awesome okay so now the
41:28 - bubbles they should really all start
41:30 - like uh below the screen
41:41 - like five times the radius below the
41:43 - screen let them go faster if they want a
41:46 - little more movement and then uh if
41:50 - if Y is less than not zero but like
41:54 - their size R then set y back to the
42:00 - bottom of the screen
42:02 - let's try making uh 50 of them
42:08 - okay here's all of our bubbles and
42:11 - floating up and now what I'm going to do
42:13 - is
42:15 - uh
42:18 - in draw I'm going to say
42:23 - for every bubble a
42:28 - and every bubble
42:30 - B
42:34 - as long as a is not equal to B
42:37 - uh the distance
42:39 - between a DOT X and a DOT Y and B dot X
42:42 - and B dot y if the distance is less than
42:46 - a DOT R plus b dot r that would be a way
42:48 - of checking if two circles are
42:50 - intersecting then let's draw a line from
42:53 - a DOT x a DOT y to B dot x b
42:56 - B dot y
42:58 - uh
43:00 - and the stroke weight will be that
43:04 - distance that might be really weird
43:06 - might be a terrible idea let's just make
43:08 - the stroke weight one right now
43:10 - and then let's no longer draw the
43:12 - bubbles
43:17 - okay what did I do wrong here
43:19 - stroke weight one
43:21 - stroke zero
43:24 - uh
43:31 - uh print line d
43:37 - we're getting distances everything's
43:39 - zero oh oh no wait
43:43 - the bubbles have an X and A Y
43:46 - are all the distances zero
43:50 - oh if a equals B
43:53 - if a does not equal V not equal I see it
43:56 - in the chat everybody thank you very
43:57 - much okay
44:02 - okay so now what am I oh is stroke 255
44:08 - well I shouldn't be making mistakes yet
44:10 - okay awesome
44:15 - now this would be more interesting if
44:17 - perhaps
44:19 - this is like a Casey Reese special here
44:21 - this would be more interesting if
44:24 - um
44:26 - there were some kind of more
44:28 - sophisticated logic perhaps to the
44:30 - motion of the bubbles where they
44:32 - actually interact with each other so I
44:34 - probably should have taken like my
44:35 - flocking example or something like that
44:37 - would be much more interesting
44:39 - so you should do that because I have to
44:41 - move on
44:43 - I'm just curious here to
44:47 - go for 200 bubbles
44:49 - and let it ride
44:53 - okay there we go
44:56 - intersection
44:58 - um
45:06 - I I I I I I I really need to stop what
45:10 - I'm doing right now
45:14 - I swear this is going to be it
45:19 - like this oh too much too much too much
45:21 - oh that's fine then I wanted to
45:24 - um why is the background Alpha not
45:26 - working uh I just wanted to see
45:28 - something stroke weight distance
45:33 - if this would actually be interesting
45:35 - okay everyone's telling me to be done
45:37 - not really
45:39 - okay
45:41 - wait I just understand why the alpha the
45:43 - best oh that doesn't work in uh
45:44 - processing
45:47 - uh
45:51 - just let me finish this off
46:00 - there we go
46:02 - but let's just make this back to two
46:04 - okay we're done
46:12 - I kind of like it actually it's kind of
46:15 - strange I'm good I I know I know I'm
46:17 - gonna move on let's go back to 50. uh
46:27 - okay
46:28 - we're done
46:31 - I'm on number five debug view okay
46:35 - we could make a debug view of this
46:37 - let's make a debug view of this okay so
46:40 - let me
46:41 - save as
46:43 - January 5.
46:46 - so
46:48 - um
46:50 - so okay so I'm gonna do
46:54 - oh this is interesting
46:59 - uh what should be a debug view of this
47:02 - hmm
47:04 - I mean I guess I want to see the circles
47:07 - okay
47:08 - so I know what to do
47:14 - watch this this is going to be kind of
47:16 - weird but
47:17 - um
47:24 - debug I'm just going to say
47:27 - um intersect
47:29 - intersect is false
47:36 - intersect is going to be false for all
47:38 - of them if they're intersecting
47:39 - something a DOT intersect is true
47:45 - and
47:47 - B dot intersect is false
47:52 - and then in Show
47:56 - um if a DOT intercept oh no if intersect
48:03 - fill
48:06 - like red
48:08 - but with some nice Alpha
48:10 - else fill
48:14 - green
48:15 - with some Alpha
48:20 - so this should look like this now
48:24 - and the debug view probably should have
48:27 - the regular background
48:34 - and let's
48:38 - say no stroke
48:40 - and let's make this even lighter
48:45 - so now
48:48 - that's the debug view so we can see
48:50 - which ones are intersecting and which
48:52 - ones aren't
48:54 - and if the lines are correct why is my
48:57 - rectangle still in there so the whole
48:59 - thing is like flickering like crazy
49:01 - oh whoops I left this in there no wonder
49:03 - okay hold on this will help
49:07 - all right I like this I like that as
49:10 - debug view okay we're done moving on
49:14 - what am I on steal like an artist oh
49:17 - right Chachi PT let's use Chachi be
49:19 - teeth I think
49:26 - well I'm gonna have to log in I don't
49:29 - shoot
49:30 - um yeah let's see
49:32 - oh somehow for some reason I've got my
49:34 - password saved in here for my chat gbt
49:37 - account all right that's fine I don't
49:39 - want my I definitely do not want my
49:40 - conversation history being shown right
49:42 - now no no no no okay good
49:45 - foreign
49:48 - I leave you to try to decipher what kind
49:51 - of life my my what my life is like that
49:53 - that's my
49:55 - GPT history okay
49:58 - um make me an artwork that is uh create
50:03 - actually what I should just be doing is
50:05 - going and stealing whatever oh I know
50:07 - what I should do uh Raphael do you have
50:10 - all of your January prompts somewhere
50:11 - can I just get your January 6th one that
50:14 - would be good
50:15 - create an artwork
50:17 - that is not original
50:20 - that I can copy for a P5 JS sketch that
50:25 - is very artistic
50:36 - yeah I know I can okay
50:37 - I'm feeling
50:40 - lazy would you mind
50:42 - just giving me the code thank you
50:50 - what okay yeah basic code template no I
50:54 - don't want a template
50:55 - oh please
50:58 - oh they're giving me more
51:00 - okay
51:03 - all right this is gonna be good
51:12 - okay all right yeah yeah that's what I'm
51:14 - gonna do I'm gonna build on my own okay
51:17 - what's this January six
51:22 - January
51:24 - six
51:28 - oh
51:29 - that does not look like starry night at
51:31 - all
51:33 - um let's make them swirl
51:47 - so let's make an array
51:49 - and
51:55 - um
51:57 - so let uh
52:00 - uh Stars let's just make it a vector
52:02 - push create vector
52:05 - X comma y
52:08 - then I'm going to say
52:12 - and then let's put this
52:16 - here
52:19 - uh then let's say four
52:23 - um
52:25 - for V of stars
52:29 - point
52:31 - V Dot X V Dot y
52:33 - stroke oh it should already Okay so
52:36 - let's see
52:37 - okay so those are the stars and now what
52:40 - I want to do is I want to say
52:44 - um
52:45 - uh
52:47 - uh okay how about this
52:50 - let's star
52:52 - of stars
52:56 - and then the vector is a P5 Vector
53:01 - subtract
53:04 - Center oh I should just do it this is so
53:08 - silly
53:09 - let's do Translate
53:13 - to the center
53:16 - we're going to make Starry Night people
53:17 - better than chat gbt ever could
53:21 - um
53:22 - uh minus
53:24 - width divided by 2
53:26 - minus height divided by two
53:29 - where do I have an error line 22
53:35 - so
53:36 - let a equal star dot heading
53:41 - a DOT rotate by pi divided by two
53:47 - um
53:50 - then
53:52 - um
53:53 - V equals
53:56 - Vector from angle a
54:00 - oh no no no okay
54:01 - no no no I'm going to rotate the oh I'm
54:04 - so confused
54:07 - yeah yeah yeah okay I got it I got it I
54:10 - got it star oh no I know
54:14 - this is very silly what I'm doing let V
54:17 - equals star dot copy there's so many
54:20 - other ways I could do this
54:21 - V Dot rotate pi divided by two
54:26 - that's what I want to do uh
54:28 - V Dot setmag to three
54:32 - or just a one let's just normalize it
54:36 - and then a star dot add V
54:43 - there we go
54:45 - Starry Night people
54:58 - okay starry night everybody moving on
55:03 - we're on Sample a color palette from
55:06 - your favorite okay hold on I gotta go
55:08 - look at the actual prompt there
55:12 - movie album cover all right I don't know
55:14 - what my favorite movie is
55:24 - uh
55:26 - um favorite movie how about 80 for Brady
55:30 - not seated do you know that there's a
55:32 - movie called 80 for Brady Brady for 80.
55:34 - I don't know it yeah sounds completely
55:36 - insane um let's do night of the coconut
55:40 - code not movie poster okay
55:44 - um night of the coconut
55:46 - because I am Patrick willem's number one
55:49 - fan
55:51 - um let's copy save this image
55:55 - Knight of the coconut let's go back and
55:58 - get our
56:01 - um
56:02 - oh this is actually kind of interesting
56:04 - the glitch of this actually became
56:07 - Cyclops Gloria this actually is working
56:09 - in a much more
56:11 - strange and wonderful way that I ever
56:14 - imagined it's quite horrifying but here
56:16 - we go
56:17 - uh okay yep well you're gonna have to
56:20 - sign up for nebula if you want to watch
56:21 - Night of the coconut
56:24 - nebula dot TV slash codingtree okay
56:29 - um
56:30 - so we are going to
56:34 - all right let's do this
56:37 - um we're gonna use this January 7th I'm
56:39 - gonna keep using this
56:41 - January 7 P image
56:44 - coconut
56:48 - coconut equals load image
56:53 - uh where is that image
56:56 - downloads
57:00 - light of the coconut
57:03 - um
57:08 - why I say NOC oh I'm like why does it
57:11 - say nature of code I name everything NOC
57:13 - for nature of code and I just named it
57:15 - NOC for Knight it's notc
57:19 - foreign
57:21 - really I'm just here pathetically uh um
57:25 - you know trying to uh put my name out
57:28 - there for a cameo in the sequel
57:31 - okay
57:33 - um
57:34 - notc dot jpeg
57:38 - um okay so now we've loaded that image
57:41 - it's missing or excess inaccessible
57:44 - oh who puts an e in their jpeg come on
57:49 - um
57:53 - um okay
57:54 - so uh int x equals floor random notc dot
58:00 - with this is a terrible way of doing
58:03 - this okay hold on a second let's look at
58:05 - the let's do something a little nicer
58:06 - the image is 1500 by 1500 okay that's a
58:09 - little bit nuts let's go and change it
58:11 - to
58:13 - um
58:14 - 800 by 800 perfectly reasonable size
58:16 - let's make our canvas
58:20 - 800 by 800 what was the prompt again I
58:23 - don't even remember
58:25 - sample a color palette okay and let's
58:32 - um
58:34 - oh yeah let's put this back in
58:36 - uh I'm not gonna worry about the
58:38 - intersecting bubbles anymore that was
58:40 - for another thing
58:42 - now
58:43 - we are just going to say uh
58:49 - color C equals notc did I call it notc
58:53 - here coconut that's not how you spell
58:55 - coconut notc
58:59 - uh notc.getxy
59:03 - fill
59:04 - C with some Alpha
59:09 - this is like me just recreating one of
59:12 - my sort of classic examples get int int
59:14 - for the Type image okay
59:17 - I'm going to convert it to an integer
59:25 - okay I like it I like it
59:28 - I like it a lot
59:30 - um let's make a
59:34 - 250 of these
59:40 - um
59:41 - let's do this
59:44 - start with background zero
59:47 - and let's make them much smaller
59:57 - and here we go
60:02 - everybody it is a night of the coconut
60:08 - okay we're done I'm moving on
60:12 - uh January 8th oh no sign distance
60:15 - functions I know sign distance functions
60:18 - do I have
60:21 - so I was learning these
60:26 - does this count because I think this is
60:28 - code that I wrote no it's code that I
60:31 - got for somebody else
60:33 - fascinating
60:35 - all right so wait let's let's make my
60:38 - own sign distance function
60:41 - assigned I really want to make a video
60:45 - about this sine distance function uh
60:48 - Circle rectangle no let's do Circle
60:50 - because this is a health we're going to
60:51 - do kind of hello world sign distance
60:53 - functions function which takes a
60:55 - position as an input and outputs the
60:57 - distance from that position to the
60:59 - nearest part of the shape
61:00 - okay
61:03 - um so many wonderful tutorials here uh
61:06 - okay so basically
61:10 - I would like to
61:13 - go let's make a new sketch
61:34 - we're gonna do a nested Loop
61:37 - to look at every single Pixel
61:52 - let's just make sure
61:55 - this is right
61:57 - and we're going to say
62:00 - um
62:02 - what is it called load pixels load
62:05 - pixels update pixels and I'm going to
62:09 - say no Loop just for right now let's run
62:11 - the sketch
62:12 - okay so this is giving me a random pixel
62:16 - a random grayscale value for every pixel
62:18 - and
62:20 - I would like to
62:26 - uh to save this January 8th is that what
62:29 - I'm on eight yeah sign distance function
62:30 - so now we need to write a function
62:32 - called SDF and it should receive
62:36 - an X
62:37 - and a y
62:40 - and it should return
62:42 - some kind of distance
62:45 - and then
62:49 - we're going to make
62:53 - a color out of it
62:55 - so in this case
62:57 - oh right one so um
63:01 - so let's imagine the distance is like
63:03 - kind of normalized between zero and one
63:04 - I don't know if that makes sense so now
63:06 - they're all white if I so I'm just hard
63:08 - coding a distance value I'm doing this
63:11 - in a terrible way let's let's actually
63:13 - return the distance
63:16 - and let's say
63:21 - and then color
63:23 - you know let's map the distance between
63:25 - zero and one to zero and two whatever
63:27 - the minimum and maximum is just to like
63:28 - set us up for Success later okay so this
63:32 - I believe is the idea of assigned
63:35 - distance function
63:36 - I receive any point and it's signed
63:39 - because I can actually return negative
63:41 - values for a distance which is something
63:43 - you wouldn't normally do because you
63:45 - can't have a negative distance but this
63:47 - is
63:47 - just talking about
63:51 - things in a abstract computer Graphics
63:54 - world
63:55 - so what would be the sign distance
63:58 - function oh no I don't want to for
64:03 - um like a circle
64:07 - I don't want sign distance field
64:08 - although that's probably the same thing
64:10 - so like
64:12 - 2DS distance to a given point would be
64:15 - right
64:16 - uh
64:18 - so the distance is the square root right
64:20 - so let's think about this
64:21 - so let's say I want stop stop stop no
64:25 - cancel cancel not now let's say I want
64:28 - to say the distance is the distance
64:31 - between
64:33 - x y and the center of the screen
64:38 - and
64:40 - um so I'm actually going to
64:42 - just now
64:45 - I don't need to map that
64:46 - so this I would get
64:48 - right so is this kind of like a
64:51 - scientist have I have I implemented this
64:54 - I want to do more with this but is this
64:57 - technically a sign distance function
64:58 - there's no negative
65:02 - um
65:03 - um I think I would do it as like a
65:05 - threshold uh like so for example
65:09 - I could say also say if distance is
65:11 - greater than 100 return one else
65:17 - returns zero
65:21 - um
65:23 - and that would get me
65:28 - something like this
65:31 - so I've written a function to draw a
65:33 - circle
65:34 - smooth step that would be uh not if
65:38 - there isn't the possibility of a
65:40 - negative but what do I do with the
65:41 - negative
65:51 - is that a sign distance function now
65:55 - Sable Rave says I'm done
65:59 - I need to really properly learn sign
66:01 - distance functions and do something more
66:03 - interesting with them I I did this over
66:04 - a course of a stream a while ago I think
66:06 - I should subtract yeah let's make it
66:08 - more interesting okay thank you
66:10 - um return well what do you mean like
66:12 - what do you mean by return subtract
66:17 - um
66:18 - distance minus well oh I see what you
66:21 - mean
66:22 - so and then ah okay
66:26 - so
66:27 - oh no okay okay come on yeah let's try
66:30 - this okay I see what you mean this would
66:32 - be
66:34 - what does this do yeah there we go
66:38 - this is a scientist's function yes now
66:41 - what if
66:46 - yeah oh how strange but why didn't it
66:53 - this I should see grayscale now
66:56 - shouldn't I
67:02 - this is some distance minus a hundred oh
67:04 - because I'm mapping between negative one
67:06 - and one so if I want to normalize that
67:08 - by like
67:10 - 200
67:12 - I see
67:14 - you know
67:19 - yeah I like this okay we're getting
67:20 - somewhere
67:22 - just map the negative to red and
67:25 - positive to Green Oh I like that okay
67:27 - map color equals
67:32 - um
67:49 - let's do this
67:56 - whoo okay I'm really using sign distance
67:58 - functions okay I'm done
68:00 - moving on Plants oh this is this is a
68:04 - good one
68:05 - um all right everybody plants
68:08 - should I just do a can I just now I sort
68:10 - of feel like what I'm doing here today
68:12 - is instead of starting from my coding
68:14 - challenges and changing them I'm just
68:16 - like okay I know how to make a fractal
68:18 - tree actually
68:20 - this is something that I really should
68:22 - do let me let me try I have been
68:26 - let's make a fractal tree let's do this
68:28 - and we're in processing right now
68:30 - let's make a fractal tree and we'll
68:32 - um
68:33 - what am I on number nine
68:36 - so this is going to be fun we're going
68:39 - to use a little Pearl and noise we're
68:40 - going to make a nice little plant we're
68:42 - going to use random seed it's going to
68:44 - be great
68:45 - it's going to be great
68:54 - uh
69:00 - and I'm going to say Translate
69:06 - and then I'm going to say branch
69:09 - and we have some length
69:12 - let's call it 100 Branch by the length
69:17 - and we have a function called branch
69:20 - which takes length
69:23 - and it draws a line
69:25 - from
69:27 - wherever it is
69:29 - to uh zero a negative length
69:33 - and uh the stroke weight
69:37 - is going to be 2.
69:39 - and we're going to take a look at this
69:42 - and stroke 255
69:46 - I think I'm faster in processing than P5
69:48 - which is kind of counter-intuitive but
69:51 - um
69:54 - we don't need a variable for that right
69:56 - now
69:56 - uh uh okay
69:58 - now
70:00 - there we go now we are going to say uh
70:04 - it um
70:08 - let's make it two-thirds of the length
70:10 - as long as length is greater than four
70:13 - pixels
70:16 - uh and then we need to translate to the
70:20 - end
70:22 - we need to rotate by an angle
70:28 - let's let's put this in here because I'm
70:30 - going to do something with this uh let's
70:32 - call it a pi divided by 4 just for right
70:34 - now we're going to rotate by that angle
70:36 - we're going to branch
70:39 - um
70:41 - by the length
70:43 - we're going to say push Matrix
70:46 - and pop Matrix
70:50 - and we're going to rotate by negative of
70:52 - the angle I'm going to do this in a
70:53 - different way maybe in a second and
70:55 - we're going to rotate by the branch
70:56 - again
70:59 - uh
71:00 - and do we have a fractal tree
71:03 - yes we have a rectal tree okay fractal
71:06 - tree are really bad
71:08 - um really fast
71:10 - really bad uh let's make it a little
71:13 - wider uh because nope okay okay fine
71:16 - fine fine
71:18 - so picky
71:20 - okay
71:21 - there we go so now what I would like to
71:23 - do is the following
71:24 - when we get to the end of the tree
71:27 - I always had this thing in my head about
71:30 - to draw the leaves at the end I need to
71:33 - create like a um
71:38 - a whole set of objects and keep track of
71:41 - where all the positions so I could place
71:42 - them there that's true if I want to
71:43 - animate them but if I just want to draw
71:45 - some leaves at the end
71:47 - that are green
71:49 - some Alpha
71:54 - uh
72:01 - uh this should do the trick
72:04 - see now I have some leaves on my tree I
72:06 - like that I would like them to like fly
72:08 - off but instead let's do the following
72:13 - let's say a random seed
72:18 - one and I want my random numbers to
72:20 - always be the same
72:22 - and uh I'm gonna do something weird
72:25 - which I'm not always going to Branch the
72:27 - tree if random one is less than 0.75
72:32 - uh uh branch
72:35 - to the right oh and this should this
72:39 - really needs a push in a pop also I mean
72:41 - it might I guess it doesn't need it
72:42 - technically but if random one is less
72:45 - than .75
72:48 - let's see if this does what I want it to
72:51 - do just to like yeah okay so I like this
72:54 - um because it's a little bit interesting
72:55 - and now
72:57 - we are going to say float a x offset
73:00 - equals zero
73:02 - and oh this needs to be always here x
73:06 - offset
73:08 - equals zero
73:10 - then
73:12 - um the angle is noise of X offset which
73:16 - goes to zero one which will go between 0
73:18 - and 2 well let's go between negative pi
73:21 - divided by 2 and pi divided by 2 and
73:24 - then X off plus equals 0.01
73:29 - why
73:31 - oh map noise of X offs okay sorry map
73:36 - noise of X offset to this range
73:41 - map noise of X offset which goes from
73:44 - zero and one to the okay so I only need
73:45 - one parenthesis there
73:48 - okay this is
73:51 - kind of strange
73:53 - but
73:55 - um let's let's okay okay how can I have
73:58 - many more
74:01 - um let's start with it shorter and let's
74:04 - not I'll let you all tweak this much
74:07 - more okay that kind of like that
74:11 - um
74:12 - let's do this two-thirds really makes
74:14 - more sense though
74:16 - um there I kind of like what I'm doing
74:17 - here okay so oh and now hold on I don't
74:21 - know what this is gonna do but X offset
74:25 - oh I should use 2D Berlin noise
74:29 - okay too fast too fast okay no no don't
74:31 - worry everybody don't worry X offset
74:35 - why offset
74:37 - and this is I should really do this with
74:45 - um I should really do this with like
74:46 - open Simplex noise I think it'll be much
74:48 - nicer okay
74:50 - there we go this is what I wanted yes
74:54 - [Music]
75:00 - okay moving on is the if repeated
75:03 - somebody's saying I do want to have
75:05 - these bees separate like and honestly
75:08 - like it should be much more rare that it
75:11 - doesn't branch
75:13 - and
75:15 - um
75:20 - I think this will actually be more fun
75:22 - if I go between pi and negative pi
75:29 - and if the stroke weight is also but I
75:32 - gotta stop I gotta stop there okay
75:33 - moving on
75:35 - I am by the way close to one-third
75:38 - generative music
75:40 - oh crud
75:42 - this is going to be tough for me
75:49 - all right how can I quickly make some
75:51 - generative music
75:53 - this I'm definitely gonna go to P5
75:55 - I'm gonna need an example
76:00 - uh
76:02 - uh generative music oh no what am I on
76:06 - January
76:07 - number 10.
76:09 - okay January General music um P5
76:12 - oscillator
76:15 - or envelope I want to let's use the P5
76:18 - envelope
76:19 - do I have hold on coding train oh no
76:23 - I'll never P5 uh envelope
76:27 - okay uh
76:31 - okay let's uh copy this
76:34 - so this is definitely not me starting
76:36 - from scratch but that's okay
76:38 - uh
76:42 - [Music]
76:47 - let's make it a sine wave which I think
76:49 - will be a little nicer
76:51 - okay now you're getting that sound right
76:54 - okay uh
76:57 - um okay okay let's see now I don't want
77:00 - to play the sound
77:02 - um
77:03 - with uh the mouse press
77:05 - I don't want a canvas I mean let's leave
77:08 - the canvas there just in case I want to
77:09 - do something with it and then play sound
77:12 - oscillator start envelope play where is
77:15 - the frequency set
77:19 - how do I change it if I wanted to play a
77:21 - different
77:24 - like where was
77:27 - where do I set the frequency
77:32 - hold on let's see
77:34 - um and let's see let's go to
77:38 - P5 oscillator
77:42 - oh note envelope this is an example
77:45 - by the way
77:47 - this would be helpful if I could just
77:50 - watch this video tutorial right here
77:53 - uh scale array okay that's interesting
77:56 - let's take a look at this
77:58 - set set range oscillator
78:03 - midi value midi to frequency oscillator
78:05 - frequency okay I like this so let's try
78:08 - to bring this in here
78:11 - that's a scale array which are midi
78:13 - notes
78:15 - and then
78:16 - uh scale array notes
78:20 - the note is what just like as okay zero
78:23 - okay
78:24 - so let's see midi to frequency
78:27 - I need that function oh that's a P5
78:29 - function midi to frequency that's nice
78:33 - um so I guess
78:37 - if I have this
78:40 - if what I do is I get a note
78:47 - um I try like did I get the notes yeah
78:49 - scale array scale array notes so let
78:52 - note equals zero
78:55 - and clay sound
79:00 - freak value wait what does it not know
79:05 - osc is not defined
79:07 - ah uh try osc so let's just call it I
79:12 - made it a sign oscillator so let's just
79:14 - call it osc
79:16 - open Sound control nope okay
79:26 - okay
79:29 - every time I play it okay so now
79:33 - um
79:34 - set interval
79:37 - play sound every uh second
79:42 - and then say note plus plus
79:44 - [Music]
79:57 - okay got it so now uh hey let's do a
80:03 - random walk we'll do a random walk note
80:06 - equals uh zero and we're going to say
80:10 - um uh let r e okay we're going to say if
80:14 - random is less if random is less than
80:18 - 0.5
80:19 - I mean we could certainly do a more
80:21 - exciting algorithm here but I don't got
80:23 - all day
80:25 - uh
80:27 - no plus plus
80:29 - else no minus minus
80:33 - let's get this right and then uh note
80:36 - equals constrain
80:39 - note between 0 and uh what is it
80:44 - scalearray.length
80:50 - so this should work and
80:53 - let's just give it a little bit more
80:54 - time
80:56 - [Music]
81:08 - let's have it here and
81:12 - let's have it go faster
81:20 - foreign
81:26 - music everybody moving on
81:31 - okay
81:33 - that was ten okay okay
81:36 - um
81:37 - no no gorilla sun is telling me to take
81:40 - my time I am not gonna take my time it
81:43 - is 2 30 in the afternoon I need to be
81:46 - done I need to be out here by like four
81:48 - o'clock
81:48 - uh number 11 suprematism I'm gonna have
81:52 - to look at what this prompt is
81:57 - supremacism early 20th century art
82:00 - movement focused on the fundamentals of
82:02 - geometry painted in a limited range of
82:04 - colors okay
82:07 - um what is that limited range
82:13 - um
82:14 - should I ask chat GPT to help me
82:17 - um
82:19 - no I don't want to regenerate a response
82:21 - um
82:22 - can can you provide
82:26 - me a list of RGB values for soup
82:31 - for me to make a Sue prematis I really
82:35 - don't like the idea of typing
82:36 - suprematist here because to me it has
82:39 - other connotations but I understand that
82:41 - it's something else
82:43 - but let's see what happens
82:52 - okay
82:55 - wow this is really basic
82:57 - I could have done this myself
83:01 - uh Dave is giving me a palette so we're
83:04 - gonna go with Dave thank you is was that
83:07 - on the prompt
83:09 - uh we're gonna go with Dave's palette
83:11 - although I don't have the chat up so I'm
83:12 - gonna have to retype it
83:15 - um okay let's let's go back to P5 for
83:18 - this one
83:20 - uh new January
83:25 - 11. so we're going to get a palette
83:33 - and let's go for all right here we go
83:36 - I've got this chat nobody type any chat
83:38 - message zero a080a
83:42 - I'm so glad that Dave is here
83:46 - um zero eight zero a0a
83:49 - um
83:50 - uh F 7 F 3 F2 if you're wondering why
83:54 - I'm looking over there that's where I
83:55 - see the chat
83:58 - um
84:00 - zero zero seven seven e one
84:06 - um
84:08 - f
84:09 - five D two one six
84:12 - okay
84:14 - uh F3
84:17 - fc3503 okay thank you
84:22 - um I really want
84:23 - nah it's fine okay so now
84:26 - we are going to
84:28 - limit myself to
84:30 - okay
84:32 - let's make it just with one rectangle
84:36 - one Circle ellipses always look funny to
84:39 - me and a lie
84:41 - so we're going to
84:44 - uh let color One Is Random from the
84:49 - palette
84:50 - but color two is a random from the
84:53 - palette
84:54 - you know what let's let's not do that I
84:56 - feel like we should be very prescriptive
84:58 - for this
85:00 - C of palette
85:03 - and if oh hold on
85:07 - I got it now four let I equal zero I is
85:11 - less than palette dot length I plus plus
85:16 - uh if I um
85:18 - uh if I modulo 3 is 0
85:24 - then let's draw a rectangle
85:29 - at
85:30 - [Music]
85:31 - um
85:31 - I
85:34 - uh all right let's we'll make this
85:36 - random
85:46 - and we're gonna say fill palette
85:50 - I
85:52 - uh no stroke
85:55 - and we'll start with a
85:58 - background
85:59 - palette
86:01 - zero
86:05 - and we're going to go from one
86:08 - else if I
86:13 - modular two is this what I'm doing is it
86:16 - well this doesn't make any sense
86:19 - um
86:25 - every third
86:30 - yeah
86:32 - um
86:35 - wait I'm like losing my mind here wait
86:37 - hold on let me pull the chat back up
86:39 - because it lost
86:41 - I put an S instead of a d on the fourth
86:44 - color
86:47 - thank you
86:50 - okay so now what I want to do is what
86:53 - I'm saying is when it's one I want it to
86:55 - be a let's say when it's zero rectangle
86:59 - one Circle
87:01 - three line four
87:05 - rectangle so if
87:10 - why am I why is my brain
87:13 - not working here
87:15 - this was projected on the oh look uh big
87:18 - Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was
87:23 - suggested earlier sorry I'm not doing a
87:24 - good job of keeping an eye on the
87:25 - Discord chat that's also going on
87:27 - simultaneously
87:29 - um all right I need to take a breath
87:31 - here for a second I've been go go go go
87:33 - going
87:38 - I think I could pick one of three random
87:41 - shapes is fine
87:43 - so let's just do it that way if random
87:47 - one
87:56 - if R is less than 0.33
88:00 - do a rectangle
88:05 - else if R is less than 0.67
88:09 - do a circle
88:18 - and
88:21 - otherwise
88:24 - let's go look let's look at the
88:25 - Wikipedia page again
88:29 - I lost that page oh suprematism here it
88:31 - is
88:33 - um
88:38 - Circle oh I like the guy oh is it just
88:41 - one thing oh no suprematism oh I like
88:45 - this oh I can rotate oh I like this okay
88:48 - let's be a little bit more let's let's
88:50 - be a little more okay
88:52 - so else
88:54 - um
88:55 - stroke Okay so
88:58 - no fill
89:01 - stroke
89:03 - weight four
89:06 - uh line
89:09 - um
89:11 - I think let's just do vertical or
89:13 - horizontal lines which would actually be
89:14 - just like a rectangle but
89:16 - um
89:18 - I'm kind of let's do Translate
89:27 - uh if random one is less than 0.5 rotate
89:33 - by pi divided by 2. it's really doing
89:35 - this weird uh and then the length is a
89:40 - random value between uh 10 and width
89:44 - divided by 2. so let's write a line that
89:47 - is from negative length 0 to positive
89:52 - length zero and
89:55 - it shouldn't matter but I'm just going
89:57 - to put push and pop around this just in
89:59 - case
90:00 - and let's run this
90:07 - okay where's my line people no fill a
90:10 - stroke
90:11 - C right
90:13 - what was it called palette I
90:19 - um
90:20 - let's do uh let's do 50 and then pilot I
90:25 - Mel um I
90:28 - modulo palette length I don't know why
90:32 - I'm choosing to do this in order and
90:33 - other things random
90:37 - um
90:39 - what's wrong now
90:47 - why does that not work I
90:54 - palette dot length I
90:58 - oh what no
91:01 - it doesn't matter
91:02 - oh there there there I see I see oh I've
91:06 - done this in such a silly way
91:09 - um okay yay okay now uh everything is
91:13 - way too big
91:24 - and
91:25 - um
91:27 - I think we should also allow for
91:32 - rotate
91:38 - not trans let's rotate by I'm just
91:40 - curious here so I do this okay there we
91:44 - go I kind of like what I did
91:47 - suprematism everybody
91:52 - oh I need the 45 degree rotation should
91:54 - I make it
92:03 - suprematism I kind of like this not so
92:06 - bad it's actually quite a bit better
92:08 - than I expected depalm I totally agree
92:10 - All Right Moving On
92:13 - oh wait what happened oh because I went
92:15 - into the chat okay
92:17 - all right tessellation
92:20 - tessellation this I should be able to do
92:23 - no problem
92:26 - so I get my wave function collapse
92:28 - example out
92:33 - um
92:36 - okay
92:38 - tessellation what do I want to do here
92:41 - what do I want to attempt
92:51 - let's see what is the let's see what the
92:53 - prompt says it has any nice
92:55 - details oh should we try one of these
92:58 - more specific ones oh oh I've see I've
93:00 - done a lot of this maybe I should go get
93:02 - my
93:04 - um
93:08 - I've always wanted to do try hexanal try
93:11 - hexagonal tiling that looks like kind of
93:13 - fun
93:14 - uh this one is wild same kind okay I got
93:17 - to do something simple
93:19 - uh like this
93:24 - this looks fun
93:27 - should we try to make this how hard
93:29 - could that be
93:31 - let's try to make this okay hexagons are
93:35 - fun all right let's do this in
93:36 - processing
93:38 - um
93:39 - yeah so
93:42 - it's just January what number am I on
93:44 - now
93:46 - I'm getting tired I'm only on 12. okay
93:50 - uh okay
93:51 - uh
93:55 - so I need a function to draw a hexagon
93:57 - that shouldn't be too hard right there's
93:59 - a lot of stuff here
94:02 - um let's write a function
94:04 - hexagon
94:06 - uh which gets a what an X and A Y
94:10 - and a um
94:12 - let's give it like an R for size
94:16 - so we are going to say push
94:19 - Matrix
94:21 - pop Matrix I think I'm going to need to
94:23 - turn the heat on people
94:25 - which I know creates a little bit of a
94:27 - noise in the background I'm going to
94:28 - just go ahead and do that
94:31 - because I'm getting very cold my hands
94:33 - can't type right now
94:42 - so you're going to hear a worrying of a
94:44 - fan momentarily
94:50 - uh hexagon
94:52 - has six sides
94:57 - and we want to say
95:00 - create shape
95:04 - is that it well begin shape
95:10 - end shape
95:15 - uh and then I want to say x equals R
95:20 - times
95:22 - okay uh let's say angle
95:25 - angle is map I between 0 and 6 to 0 and
95:29 - to Pi
95:32 - X is R times cosine of the angle
95:36 - Y is R times sine of the angle
95:41 - set a vertex
95:43 - at x y
95:46 - um
95:51 - that should be
95:53 - it right
95:55 - oh we've got a bit of oh okay no okay
95:57 - Translate
95:59 - to the X Y
96:01 - 'all it's fine uh
96:04 - I don't know it's complaining at me here
96:06 - so let's just do this
96:11 - I hate underscores as variable names but
96:13 - I'm just doing it now okay so what
96:15 - happens if I were to draw
96:19 - um let's say fill 255.
96:22 - hexagon
96:24 - [Music]
96:25 - um
96:26 - 200 200 100.
96:31 - okay oops
96:33 - too many pop matrixes matrices
96:39 - okay that looks like a hexagon
96:41 - there's a polygon function
96:45 - well I'm doing it myself they'll be like
96:47 - all sorts of wonderful possibilities
96:48 - here I should actually make my own
96:50 - polygon function
96:52 - polygon
96:54 - uh int n
96:56 - uh six
96:58 - polygon
97:01 - there
97:02 - take that
97:10 - polygon
97:13 - take that designers are processing
97:17 - that's a ninagon okay so now what do I
97:21 - need to do I need to where's that tile
97:23 - holders this tiling
97:26 - um so interesting so it looks like
97:28 - whatever my R is
97:31 - okay I think I understand what this is
97:33 - but I think I'm just going to kind of
97:35 - trial and error it
97:38 - so I'm going to say four
97:41 - and uh let's use a float X
97:45 - so let's have r equal 50. x equals let's
97:49 - try from negative r
97:51 - to X is less than width plus r x plus
97:55 - equal R looks like it was times two I'm
97:57 - just making this up
98:00 - I probably could read what the actual
98:02 - tiling is and then y
98:06 - probably needs to start like
98:09 - I think every other one is going to be
98:11 - slightly offset but that's fine r y is
98:15 - less than a height plus r and then y
98:18 - plus equal and then let's draw a polygon
98:25 - that is six-sided at X comma y with r
98:32 - okay we're getting somewhere
98:36 - so
98:38 - interesting
98:42 - interesting okay I really I need this
98:48 - four
98:50 - so if I'm starting here what I want to
98:52 - see is the first one
98:55 - um
98:58 - okay
99:06 - I think this is kind of like what I want
99:07 - to do
99:09 - whoa
99:12 - um I would like to see a stroke because
99:15 - it'll help me understand
99:17 - what's going on here
99:27 - okay so now I know that like the next
99:31 - one needs to be offset so I really
99:34 - should do this by columns and rows but
99:36 - I'll just do a counter
99:39 - so if
99:42 - counter
99:46 - oh I I also think I need to do the Y on
99:50 - the outside
99:51 - and it might not actually matter but
99:53 - that's going to help me understand
99:55 - so
99:57 - if counter mod
100:00 - 2 is zero
100:02 - then let's offset
100:04 - the row by r
100:08 - and this is this very silly way of doing
100:10 - this but
100:15 - uh let's do this
100:17 - okay
100:21 - oh and now every every time then counter
100:26 - goes up
100:31 - okay so I think this is by the way this
100:34 - is a nice tessellation and yes if I want
100:36 - to see the close of the stroke
100:39 - I should do this
100:42 - um
100:44 - I kind of like my tessellation anyway
100:48 - so haha uh
100:56 - I feel like I've made a nice
100:58 - tessellation even though it's not
100:59 - exactly yeah good enough I agree
101:01 - tessellation everybody
101:03 - moving on
101:06 - something you've always wanted to learn
101:08 - a sign distance functions
101:11 - maybe I should go learn sign distance
101:13 - functions a little bit more what's
101:14 - another thing oh 3js
101:22 - let's try 3js Okay uh hello world3.js
101:32 - uh all right chat GPT should be able to
101:34 - help me out here can you uh give me a
101:39 - blank boilerplate
101:42 - uh 3.js JavaScript example
101:52 - okay excellent excellent
101:54 - okay okay
102:00 - this looks pretty good
102:02 - all right all right
102:05 - so where am I going to put this code oh
102:07 - I guess I'm getting Visual Studio code
102:09 - up
102:11 - uh
102:13 - uh all right code
102:15 - yes
102:17 - where's Visual Studio code
102:23 - did I lose it applications
102:33 - I don't understand Visual Studio code
102:35 - here it is okay
102:37 - um
102:46 - uh I have no idea wait what I didn't
102:49 - even open how could there be changes
102:51 - already okay fine don't save
102:54 - uh
102:58 - save as
103:04 - a new file I forgot how to use a text
103:06 - editor Okay no Okay ah all right fine
103:10 - fine
103:12 - foreign
103:18 - 11 make a directory uh January
103:24 - uh uh 13. why did I say 11 when it's
103:27 - clearly 13.
103:29 - uh
103:36 - uh
103:42 - okay
103:49 - got my HTML file
103:52 - uh
103:54 - uh
103:57 - run a web server
104:00 - okay uh that's good
104:03 - um now let's go back
104:05 - so I get like a boilerplate
104:10 - okay
104:11 - uh
104:13 - oh that's okay
104:16 - uh
104:18 - index.j let's save this as uh
104:22 - index.js
104:26 - um
104:29 - uh
104:33 - uh may I have the HTML file to go along
104:37 - with this please
104:41 - okay so let's take a look oh whoops
104:45 - hey where'd it go
104:48 - copy code
104:52 - okay
104:53 - scene perspective render Cube oh I've
104:58 - got a cube here okay so I'll I'll try to
105:01 - do something a bit more
105:03 - with uh geometry box mesh material Cube
105:08 - okay maybe I'll make an array of cubes
105:10 - and spin them around
105:14 - um
105:21 - very slow this is good I get to take a
105:23 - little this is the only time I get to
105:24 - take a little break I'm halfway through
105:26 - at an hour and 25 minutes I think not
105:28 - halfway through but close to halfway
105:29 - through hour 25 minutes it's pretty good
105:31 - I'm almost done with my coffee
105:36 - foreign
105:41 - I could turn on
105:44 - um noise reduction but
105:46 - I feel like sometimes that um okay uh
105:50 - great
105:51 - is that the most recent 3js version that
105:54 - can't be right
105:57 - but it's fine
105:59 - um okay so now
106:04 - oh I see uh I do not want
106:11 - yeah so why isn't this
106:13 - doing anything
106:16 - here we go okay
106:19 - all right so I've got
106:21 - uh so I have got we're definitely not
106:25 - getting sub two hours I love that I have
106:27 - got something going in 3js so let's play
106:31 - around and make something myself so I'm
106:34 - going to try
106:37 - now let's just make a bunch of these
106:40 - uh
106:45 - uh one one one is just putting it in the
106:48 - scent oh Cube rotation
106:53 - hmm
106:54 - all right let's just try this
106:57 - um
106:59 - let's try making 10 of them
107:04 - and
107:13 - um scene add cubes cubes
107:16 - push Q Where do I do I give it a
107:20 - Translate
107:23 - um
107:24 - can I give everyone a
107:27 - uh
107:28 - uh Cube dot x equals random negative
107:32 - let's just try this
107:33 - I'm gonna add an X and A Y
107:37 - and what aren't I in 3D
107:40 - Okay so
107:42 - this and then
107:44 - if I say Cube
107:50 - all right hold on
107:52 - I don't know like Cube I'm just making
107:55 - up stuff Translate
108:01 - the variables don't need to be there I
108:03 - just was curious
108:05 - uh
108:07 - oh random is not defined okay that's
108:09 - fine no problem
108:14 - um
108:20 - let's try this
108:28 - translate has been removed translate on
108:30 - axis
108:32 - huh
108:34 - okay
108:39 - well what's the axis
108:41 - translate okay
108:43 - set a position of object in 3.js
108:49 - position
108:50 - oh I just give it a position
108:53 - a vector 3 default is zero zero zero how
108:56 - do I make a vector three
108:58 - okay ah okay
109:00 - distance two okay
109:06 - uh
109:20 - that one
109:24 - and then
109:27 - okay
109:29 - position
109:32 - so do I just say Cube position equals
109:40 - a new Vector three
109:46 - oh okay
109:49 - kind of sort of
109:56 - didn't seem to work oh there is a
109:58 - position here
110:00 - oh wait okay position.o
110:04 - no that's the camera
110:06 - uh okay so hold on
110:13 - uh four let cube of Cubes
110:22 - uh
110:27 - link them different sizes
110:34 - I think they're all on top of each other
110:36 - still
110:38 - how do I move them
110:42 - does anybody know
110:46 - position range is too small oh I just
110:48 - assumed everything's mapped between one
110:50 - to one
110:55 - how can I multiply the position how do I
110:58 - multiply a vector
111:02 - um
111:02 - well I'll just do it myself manually
111:14 - I don't know what the range of positions
111:16 - is
111:26 - okay
111:29 - I like this
111:46 - okay
111:55 - I'm pretty sure everything's kind of
111:57 - mapped and yeah all right I like this
111:59 - this is good
112:02 - okay
112:04 - um
112:15 - okay uh
112:25 - um
112:50 - okay a bunch of rotated cubes
112:55 - ah
112:59 - color
113:01 - I I would love to like change the way it
113:03 - looks but
113:05 - all right all right I learned 3js
113:07 - everybody moving on
113:10 - I didn't really learn 3js but maybe I'll
113:13 - add a sine wave into this in a bit
113:16 - moving on okay uh 14th
113:21 - acemic all right I'm gonna have to look
113:23 - at what this is
113:25 - 14
113:30 - is left to the right almost the way ah
113:33 - unreadable oh
113:37 - this is really interesting
113:40 - oh this is perfect for my
113:43 - um
113:45 - oh like handwriting
113:47 - oh this is
113:49 - awesome
113:51 - okay I got an idea
113:53 - okay
113:55 - um let's go to I have an exit coding
113:58 - challenge that I think will give me the
114:01 - beginning of what I want to do
114:07 - um I would like to get to the coding
114:08 - train page here it is
114:11 - uh not evolutionary all right fine
114:14 - everybody new coding Train website I
114:17 - don't need Google anymore uh
114:19 - steering behaviors
114:23 - this one is what I'm looking for
114:26 - uh okay
114:28 - so let's get rid of the okay so let's
114:31 - duplicate this
114:34 - uh January what am I on 14.
114:43 - let's get rid of the vehicles
114:46 - uh uh let's put this here let's get the
114:49 - points
114:51 - uh let's get rid of that
114:54 - uh let's get rid of that this
114:57 - okay
114:59 - so let's just see here okay what do I
115:01 - got train okay
115:03 - now
115:06 - um
115:08 - oh hi Henry
115:10 - exactly programming from A to Z although
115:12 - now I'm interpreting this as like the
115:14 - handwriting not the actual text itself
115:17 - so what I'd like to do is just say
115:20 - circle like just to see what I've got
115:22 - here Point dot y uh four
115:28 - um and then fill uh 255 no stroke
115:33 - okay and let's get rid of this
115:37 - there we go okay
115:39 - so now to make this
115:43 - unreadable
115:46 - and again shape and shape
115:50 - oh no
115:52 - um
115:55 - vertex
115:58 - uh
116:04 - okay
116:05 - stroke 255.
116:10 - and no fill
116:14 - interesting okay
116:17 - we're getting somewhere
116:18 - now let's use
116:23 - um and it would be really nice to
116:25 - animate this
116:26 - so let's
116:30 - put this in draw
116:38 - what do I got going on oh wait going
116:40 - back and forth between these two
116:42 - environments is definitely going to be a
116:44 - little tricky what did I miss
116:46 - great canvas background
116:53 - those are all extra curly bracket okay
116:56 - um okay so now what I'd like to do is
117:05 - um
117:11 - okay
117:13 - um we're going to for each point
117:15 - we're going to say x offset equals map
117:18 - Point dot x 0 to width to between 0 and
117:22 - 1.
117:23 - and the Y offset is going to be the same
117:29 - zero to height
117:31 - then Z offset is zero which we'll leave
117:36 - right now then I'm going to make an
117:38 - angle
117:40 - which is
117:45 - um noise X offset y offset Z offset
117:49 - times two pi
117:54 - then I want to make a vector
117:57 - from angle
117:59 - a
118:02 - and V Dot uh set magnitude we're just
118:06 - going to make it like 10 pixels right
118:08 - now and then this is going to be plus V
118:10 - Dot X
118:12 - Plus
118:13 - V Dot y I'm just curious what this is
118:15 - going to do
118:16 - okay and now let's try Z offset
118:20 - so these move wiggle around
118:24 - okay
118:26 - um what what error am I getting here P5
118:29 - reserved function reserved function with
118:33 - where did I use that
118:39 - where am I using like some weird word
118:43 - that I'm not supposed to be using but
118:44 - anyway
118:45 - um let's make this
118:47 - 50.
118:50 - and let's put
118:52 - um background zero here I like how it's
118:55 - smearing but okay
118:58 - this is pretty wild
119:01 - it's not real words okay uh so let's
119:07 - um
119:09 - so let's create I know uh uh
119:16 - well we could be more interesting about
119:18 - how we're picking the text
119:20 - um
119:23 - how did it get why do I have this weird
119:25 - font and
119:27 - size uh 12.
119:31 - why
119:33 - where is it getting oh it's getting it
119:36 - here
119:38 - um
119:40 - I didn't see that there were like
119:42 - arguments here
119:44 - sample Factor okay see ah I gotcha
119:48 - um
119:50 - okay so let's just do this
119:53 - let uh text
120:05 - um
120:19 - okay
120:24 - uh
120:28 - uh
120:34 - let's make some random text
120:46 - okay
120:47 - [Music]
120:48 - um zero
120:51 - zero is going to put it up there
120:55 - why is it yelling at me I want somebody
120:57 - to tell me why it's yelling at me what's
120:59 - going on
121:01 - um
121:06 - uh then what I'm going to do
121:09 - is if random 1 is less than uh
121:14 - every about every
121:17 - so many characters uh
121:23 - let's give it a line break
121:29 - and then
121:31 - let's use
121:33 - the text here
121:35 - why is it not giving me a line break
121:39 - I don't really care I guess
121:42 - uh
121:50 - uh 150
121:53 - okay there we go
122:02 - enjoy my very strange
122:05 - text
122:07 - all right
122:09 - uh this is January 14. moving on
122:14 - sine waves oh look at this let's add a
122:17 - sine wave oh this is beautiful
122:20 - um okay
122:21 - uh so this is January 15. we're gonna
122:25 - make this in a sign into a sine wave
122:28 - um so the angle is actually the mapping
122:33 - hmm
122:34 - okay how do I want to do this I want
122:36 - each letter essentially each point
122:41 - two okay I got it I got it I got it zero
122:44 - to width zero to two pi
122:49 - and this will just be the angle
122:52 - and then uh whoa
122:56 - um
122:57 - now what I want to do is
123:02 - sine of the angle times 50.
123:06 - okay so the text is in a sine wave
123:10 - but
123:12 - um
123:13 - plus Z off
123:17 - uh
123:21 - and maybe
123:24 - the I don't know why this isn't working
123:26 - I can figure that out later
123:31 - and let's change the text now to
123:42 - line wave
123:50 - all right
123:54 - oh wait I see it's this here that that
123:57 - doesn't actually matter up there
124:09 - okay there we go sine wave everybody
124:14 - reflection of a reflection ah we're
124:18 - gonna keep going with this one oh no did
124:20 - I forget to save as no I
124:23 - 15 was sine waves did I do a duplicate I
124:27 - hope I did I don't remember but now I'm
124:29 - doing a duplicate again
124:34 - um
124:36 - so now we're going to do a reflection
124:40 - so oops
124:44 - so let's
124:47 - reflect this
124:51 - by saying height minus
124:57 - foreign
125:04 - it's kind of a reflection but now I want
125:08 - to do a reflection of a reflection
125:10 - so we're going to start with it uh and I
125:14 - have so little room for my code
125:17 - um
125:19 - okay so now we're going to
125:22 - uh
125:23 - uh let's make it a little bit higher
125:26 - oh whoa that's what I meant
125:30 - hold on but uh this this is what I want
125:35 - um I now I want this
125:39 - and then
125:40 - uh what we're gonna do is we're gonna
125:43 - say
125:44 - four
125:45 - let I equals zero I is less than two I
125:48 - plus plus
125:50 - do this twice
125:56 - still why is it still complaining to me
126:01 - about
126:03 - this
126:05 - this is driving me crazy I is being
126:07 - redeclared yeah I don't I know okay
126:10 - that's fine
126:13 - okay okay why do I still have weird
126:16 - errors make sure you have used a P5
126:19 - reserve two pi
126:21 - yeah I know but I I'm using it I'm not
126:24 - declaring it
126:26 - maybe it's because of this the VAR what
126:29 - is going on okay I'm just gonna have to
126:32 - ignore that by the way this is getting
126:34 - really slow
126:36 - so let's make the sample distance one
126:40 - why is it running so slow all of a
126:42 - sudden
126:49 - is it my computer
126:51 - okay
126:54 - this is going
127:01 - this is going
127:10 - okay
127:13 - okay thank you Depot spending I messed
127:16 - up not saving 14 so we'll have to get
127:18 - back to that
127:20 - um okay take your time I cannot take my
127:24 - time
127:25 - um okay why is this suddenly
127:28 - going so slow
127:38 - I I'm not using a particularly powerful
127:40 - machine here I've got lots of extra text
127:44 - that I don't need
127:46 - okay there we go we're back I've got to
127:49 - figure out what this is it's making me
127:51 - crazy you have used a p5.js reserve
127:54 - variable two five
127:56 - two Pi I know
127:58 - I know
128:00 - I used it on purpose
128:07 - look at that message went away
128:11 - that message came back
128:21 - with
128:23 - what is going on
128:25 - you cannot go on until I figure this out
128:29 - why is it complaining about how I'm
128:31 - using these variables
128:44 - oh oh the nested Lube thank you
128:50 - that is a disaster
128:53 - that must be that must have messed
128:55 - things up but is that really going to
128:57 - mess this up
128:59 - foreign
129:05 - okay I'm gonna have to just let this go
129:09 - and come back to another time and just
129:11 - be fine with those error messages okay
129:14 - sine wave sine wave
129:19 - okay good okay now
129:21 - let's come back to this
129:26 - okay now let's do this twice
129:32 - and then let's say translate
129:36 - n times
129:39 - height divided by two
129:44 - it's commas oh zero
129:49 - okay but now what I want to do is
129:53 - actually reap so and then I need to say
129:56 - scale
129:59 - 1 negative one
130:03 - oh no uh uh sorry uh
130:07 - if n equals one let's just do this for a
130:11 - second okay
130:17 - how can I get the other one
130:23 - below it and reversed
130:34 - I'm feeling okay so
130:38 - I'm translating to there and then oh I
130:41 - see
130:42 - so I really need to translate to the
130:46 - center
130:47 - uh oh no the center should be
130:51 - this and then
130:55 - because oh I see
130:58 - point Y is not I I got it I got it I got
131:00 - it this actually needs to be zero
131:06 - and then what I'm doing here is
131:11 - translating to
131:14 - uh
131:19 - oh I like
131:21 - you know what this looks pretty good
131:24 - I think we got reflection of a
131:26 - reflection
131:29 - there's so much I could do visually to
131:30 - make this more interesting uh
131:37 - it's also just so darn slow
131:41 - um
131:43 - uh and then this one is
131:54 - [Music]
131:56 - I really should stop this
131:58 - I know what I'm doing now
132:00 - uh translate 100 plus this
132:04 - there we go and then
132:14 - what did that do
132:25 - now it's going to take it off
132:29 - translating and then I should scale it
132:31 - should flip it
132:33 - but it looks
132:35 - they look identical
132:55 - foreign
132:58 - yeah weird it is working but I don't
133:01 - know why I guess if I flip I don't
133:03 - actually want to flip it
133:06 - it's a way that's a reflection of a
133:09 - reflection okay I'm on a four hour Pace
133:11 - okay reflection of reflection we're good
133:13 - this was number 16. a grid inside of a
133:17 - grid inside of a grid oh this one makes
133:18 - me so happy
133:20 - okay I mean I could just do like a quad
133:21 - tree but somebody has got
133:25 - if somebody could figure out what the
133:27 - hey ho is going on with the error
133:29 - messages in the sketch I would be
133:30 - forever grateful but I'm sorry that
133:32 - you're gonna have to like type in this
133:34 - horrible URL
133:37 - there okay
133:39 - um let's go back to processing
133:41 - okay I know what to do here this one I'm
133:43 - really excited about
133:45 - uh okay
133:52 - by the way it's gotten quite warm in
133:53 - here now so let me go adjust the Heat
133:57 - okay
134:07 - uh
134:08 - uh
134:11 - um okay size 800 by 800. background
134:15 - let's just do this in draw background uh
134:18 - zero and let's also say uh the width is
134:23 - going to be 80.
134:32 - so let's first just draw a grid
134:43 - I have an idea let's do this recursively
134:47 - oh my God this is a little crazy
134:49 - this is such a bad idea
134:51 - uh
134:53 - we're gonna do float X float y float
134:58 - uh W float H and then float R for size
135:02 - okay so it's going to always assume
135:06 - it is a
135:10 - it's going to always assume it's a
135:13 - rectangle
135:14 - so I equals zero
135:17 - uh J equals zero let's use I and J it's
135:21 - a little bit clunky what I'm doing here
135:23 - uh
135:29 - um I mean honestly I could just do this
135:32 - all right no no it's fine it's fine plus
135:35 - equal r
135:37 - I is less than w
135:40 - I is less than h
135:43 - uh so I actually should equal x
135:50 - plus W let's just do the offset
135:54 - let's just do the offset here so now I'm
135:57 - going to say rectangle X Plus i y plus j
136:01 - r r
136:05 - and I'm going to say stroke 255 fill
136:12 - let's just give it like 175.
136:15 - okay and then this is
136:17 - this is January what what day am I on
136:20 - 17. oh yeah January 17. okay
136:25 - um
136:26 - so now if I were to say draw grid
136:30 - from zero zero with height uh with a you
136:35 - know 80 as this should give me
136:39 - a grid awesome this is what I want to
136:42 - see now
136:44 - um for any one of these
136:47 - if random one
136:50 - is less than there's a 10 chance and
136:54 - R is less is greater than
136:58 - one pixel
137:00 - let's just say two pixels
137:02 - I could draw a grid
137:05 - from X like where I am
137:07 - y Plus
137:10 - J
137:12 - and then
137:14 - the width is r and then the actual
137:19 - amount of grid stuff is like just just
137:21 - say r divided by 10.
137:25 - this is nuts
137:27 - is that actually like does this make
137:29 - sense
137:32 - infinite Loop here
137:36 - let's make it like a very low
137:38 - probability
137:40 - no not R is greater than if w
137:44 - you know that's fine W and H are always
137:46 - going to be the same
137:50 - the width and height is the thing that
137:53 - I'm doing and then it's going to be 10
137:54 - by 10. so let's try this
137:58 - okay
138:00 - maybe I just never got one
138:11 - just see
138:12 - uh
138:24 - oh I'm in draw
138:26 - no Loop is what I meant to do but
138:34 - so it did it
138:36 - a bunch of them
138:41 - let's see
138:44 - update the version of P5 that's what the
138:47 - error is someone's telling me
138:52 - um okay
138:53 - so why
138:59 - why oh why is this not working
139:05 - two
139:15 - let's just say w is greater than uh 80.
139:23 - there okay so this is right this is what
139:25 - I'm attempting to do
139:27 - and apologies for the um
139:30 - I think that can just be
139:37 - oh I see it's just so okay so let's
139:40 - start with
139:43 - 800 by 800. let's start with 200 okay
139:49 - okay there we go
139:51 - this is what I'm looking to do but
139:55 - I don't think my exit condition is
139:57 - working
140:05 - I don't want to do it if the individual
140:11 - size is smaller than eight let's see
140:15 - okay
140:19 - there okay it's working this is what I
140:21 - meant to do
140:22 - uh
140:24 - cool grid within a grid within a grid
140:27 - now
140:28 - I was kind of imagining uh that this
140:31 - would be a little bit more interesting
140:33 - so let's actually start with it should
140:36 - actually be
140:38 - 400
140:42 - but most of the time the probability
140:44 - should really be based on
140:51 - um
140:52 - okay ah this is what it should be
140:56 - foreign
140:58 - yeah so I'm kind of making a little
141:00 - quad tree-esque like thing there we go
141:04 - I like this better now
141:11 - all right I'm sure you can improve this
141:15 - but grade with integrid within a grid
141:18 - moving on definitely not a grid
141:23 - um let's revise this one to be January
141:25 - 18.
141:27 - so how could I do this but have it not
141:31 - be a grid
141:36 - um
141:44 - oh and then
141:50 - okay I love it definitely not a grid
141:56 - art deco
141:59 - that was my fastest one yet
142:02 - all right deck that might be my favorite
142:03 - one uh art deco
142:07 - Art Deco I need some help here
142:16 - I need some inspiration for this
142:23 - um
142:23 - [Music]
142:25 - oh dear this is tough
142:37 - let's make the Chrysler Building
142:39 - let's make the Chrysler Building in
142:42 - um
142:45 - black and white not deck oh Am I Wrong
142:47 - oh black and white black and white oh
142:49 - look at this
142:52 - hold on
142:55 - okay so this is black and white
142:59 - let's just
143:01 - adjust this yes I got it everybody
143:04 - to for number 90.
143:09 - the problem is it's already black and
143:10 - white I should have made it maybe I
143:11 - should make it colorful and then that
143:14 - would be the previous one I'll swap them
143:16 - uh okay let's um
143:27 - okay
143:38 - uh
143:40 - uh and
143:43 - um black and white black and white
143:45 - um
143:46 - let's actually do this
143:49 - um
143:52 - yeah this is pretty interesting actually
143:54 - why it's doing it in the a different
143:57 - order than I imagined
144:02 - all right
144:04 - I kind of like this
144:07 - black and white
144:10 - I mean I could start adding grayscale
144:13 - but I kind of love this
144:16 - is the strangest thing I've ever made
144:18 - and yet
144:20 - it's actually nicer than anything good
144:22 - enough done okay Chad's telling me I'm
144:25 - done Art Deco okay we're gonna make the
144:27 - Chrysler Building
144:30 - or something like the Chrysler Building
144:32 - okay
144:33 - so I'm taking this as inspiration let's
144:36 - look at this image
144:37 - okay so this is like Okay so let's go to
144:40 - P5
144:43 - uh oh
144:45 - something bad is happening
144:48 - from another window but I have no other
144:50 - windows open
144:53 - so I might have to recreate
144:58 - some of these
145:00 - which one is this by the way
145:04 - uh
145:08 - did somebody who has access to the
145:10 - coding train account actually update
145:12 - this that's what it seems like uh let's
145:14 - make a new sketch
145:16 - okay so now we're going to say
145:18 - background zero
145:21 - um
145:21 - let's draw let's do I have an idea okay
145:25 - what if I draw an ellipse that's at zero
145:28 - that's that width divided by 2 comma
145:30 - height
145:31 - that is thin like 50 and is like 300
145:35 - pixels High
145:38 - and if I were to say stroke 255 no fill
145:42 - you know this should be a rounded
145:44 - rectangle I think that would be better
145:48 - um and then uh rect mode
145:53 - you know what let's Center
145:55 - and let's actually
145:59 - wear a wrecked P5
146:03 - I always forget how the okay so this
146:06 - which one do I want
146:07 - I think I want like this rounded Corners
146:10 - so I just
146:12 - give it like a radius for the rounding
146:18 - okay so now I need to do a bunch of
146:22 - these
146:24 - for
146:33 - and then let's just say height minus I
146:36 - just times 10. just to start
146:39 - oh where's my auto refresh okay uh
146:45 - uh uh
146:48 - uh okay let's make it ah okay I see so I
146:52 - really need to think about how I'm doing
146:54 - this
146:55 - so the rectangles all should be ah not
147:00 - their location it's their height that I
147:02 - want to change
147:04 - that's actually going to make it much
147:05 - easier uh
147:10 - okay great
147:12 - and then
147:15 - their width should be minus I times five
147:19 - something like this
147:21 - oh
147:27 - pretty good okay moving on
147:30 - uh Art Deco this was sorry what was that
147:34 - that was January 20.
147:39 - Art Deco everyone okay uh Shadows ooh
147:45 - Shadows oh hmm what if I did something
147:49 - with my like Ray casting
147:51 - um that could be interesting
147:53 - or
147:55 - just kind of like negative space
147:59 - uh let's we could use that hexagon again
148:01 - we could make shadows with it I'm I'm
148:03 - kind of like I don't have an idea for
148:05 - this one oh I'm not even on it's Persian
148:08 - rug
148:09 - Persian rug
148:13 - sorry I'm always looking at the bottom
148:15 - of my screen Persian rug oh dear this
148:17 - one's going to be hard
148:20 - um Persian carpet
148:23 - wow
148:26 - wow okay
148:30 - wow
148:34 - uh
148:44 - wow okay so I do have an idea
148:49 - for how to do something that's really
148:50 - it's going to be really a poor facsimile
148:53 - for this like it's but I think we can do
148:58 - uh let's try just drawing stuff out from
149:01 - the center and reflecting it
149:04 - so let's go to P5
149:08 - uh this is January 21.
149:13 - the heat didn't come on I turned it off
149:15 - I turned it down to low
149:17 - very cold now I can't get the
149:19 - temperature right
149:20 - okay uh I also just if you let me just
149:23 - check my phone to make sure nobody in my
149:25 - family is like the house is on fire
149:27 - anything like that although presumably
149:30 - I would notice okay I'm getting a lot of
149:33 - okay yeah okay okay no no
149:36 - emergency
149:39 - uh so I think everything's good okay
149:42 - what am I on
149:43 - Persian rug okay
149:47 - um
149:48 - Persian rug yeah image processing one
149:50 - that's not a bad idea uh fractal tree
149:53 - reflected that's so Paradise demon
149:55 - that's kind of what I was thinking so I
149:58 - was going to create
150:00 - a just let's just make a vector
150:05 - uh which will start in the center
150:10 - and I'm going to draw a circle at V Dot
150:14 - X V Dot Y and have it be like 20 pixels
150:18 - and let's put background zero
150:24 - and Okay so
150:27 - What if I
150:28 - 4
150:30 - let I equal zero I is less than 10 I
150:34 - plus plus
150:37 - and this should be zero zero
150:41 - and I need to translate to width divided
150:43 - by 2 height divided by 2.
150:48 - and then I am just going to rotate by 2
150:52 - pi
150:53 - divided by 10.
150:58 - okay and this should be a number
151:04 - this could also work for reflections so
151:07 - now if I were to just say V Dot X Plus
151:10 - whoops
151:15 - this should I should see this there we
151:17 - go okay this is what I was hoping to see
151:20 - um
151:23 - okay I know stroke
151:29 - a fill 255 10. now
151:33 - let's have it
151:36 - start to I was gonna have a branch
151:40 - so this should actually be
151:45 - uh Dot
152:00 - uh and then
152:02 - um
152:07 - foreign
152:17 - function
152:25 - um and then
152:27 - uh
152:31 - uh
152:35 - so now I need a uh dots is an array
152:43 - uh dots push new DOT
152:49 - and
152:51 - uh for uh every dot uh dot of dots
152:59 - a dot dot update
153:06 - what do I what am I doing wrong here
153:09 - what's
153:14 - dot dot update dots class dot dots push
153:19 - new DOT
153:27 - here at line eight in dot update
153:32 - oh this
153:33 - [Laughter]
153:36 - oh
153:46 - [Music]
153:49 - okay excellent
154:04 - why
154:09 - okay great
154:14 - it's going so fast
154:20 - this should be the same oh I don't want
154:23 - to update sorry ah I definitely need
154:27 - no wonder no wonder no wonder
154:33 - show
154:37 - um okay so show
154:43 - um this is a silly way to do it but
154:49 - okay
154:50 - great now
154:54 - um
154:55 - what I want to do is change the way okay
154:59 - so
155:02 - this is the position
155:11 - now uh
155:14 - the direction is uh
155:17 - I don't want to make it random
155:23 - but I guess I could
155:31 - uh let's just do uh P5 dot Vector let's
155:36 - just try random to start
155:39 - and then
155:45 - okay and then
155:47 - this dot d i r rotate
155:52 - uh
155:53 - I don't know I don't know what I'm doing
155:55 - exactly
155:58 - okay
155:59 - so
156:02 - what I'm thinking is
156:07 - thank you
156:12 - um
156:13 - that at any given point
156:18 - to too slow
156:21 - um and
156:23 - let's make this smaller
156:26 - um
156:29 - there could be
156:33 - if let's just try this if random one
156:38 - is less than
156:40 - 01
156:42 - we're going to say
156:45 - dot stop push
156:47 - new DOT
156:50 - this dot pause
156:54 - so what I mean by that is uh and
157:00 - dot dot length is less than 10 let's
157:03 - just say that for right now
157:07 - okay
157:08 - but it is kind of doing what I wanted it
157:11 - to do but and um
157:16 - the thing is the dot needs
157:21 - to get a
157:24 - uh pause
157:27 - uh if pause this stop pause
157:31 - equals pause dot copy
157:34 - else this dot pause equals else
157:39 - stop pause equals create vector
157:42 - so
157:47 - um
157:49 - so uh now it's way too like perfectly
157:52 - swirly
157:54 - that's not really what I meant for it to
157:56 - do so also this dot rot
158:01 - for rotation equals a random value
158:03 - between negative
158:05 - 0.2 0.02 and
158:10 - this dot rot
158:14 - and I should probably give it some nice
158:16 - color
158:21 - what do we think anything resembling a
158:24 - Persian rug
158:27 - if I think if I gave this color
158:30 - okay I'm just so bad at color uh this
158:33 - dot color equals I need where's that
158:37 - palette
158:38 - didn't I have a palette
158:40 - um
158:43 - okay uh
158:49 - um would you mind
158:52 - giving me an array of strings in
158:56 - JavaScript that are hex codes for
159:00 - Persian
159:01 - rug colors
159:04 - there's no chance this works right
159:13 - [Laughter]
159:17 - oh I got one from Sable Ray but I can't
159:20 - copy paste from the chat is my problem I
159:23 - really have a problem that I'm not set
159:25 - up well
159:26 - to uh do that okay
159:30 - uh
159:31 - uh this
159:33 - dot color
159:35 - equals random from the Persian rug
159:39 - colors
159:40 - uh and then uh Phil
159:44 - is it gonna let me add an alpha to a
159:46 - color this way no
159:49 - that's cruel
159:51 - but we're just gonna have to leave it
159:53 - like this
160:06 - okay it's it's a little too like
160:10 - kaleidoscopy
160:11 - [Music]
160:12 - it's snow flaky
160:14 - MB lab says it has a Persian I approve I
160:17 - think I did my best effort
160:20 - um it could definitely be improved
160:22 - it's annoying me that I can't just give
160:24 - it the string plus an alpha
160:27 - um
160:28 - hold on
160:30 - this is gonna this is the worst thing I
160:32 - could ever do
160:33 - but
161:01 - all right I
161:05 - oh you can do color this color set Alpha
161:08 - good point okay I kind of like this it's
161:10 - not a Persian rug at all but I made
161:12 - something moving on
161:13 - Shadows
161:16 - um Shadows this is where I was stuck
161:19 - okay I have an idea
161:21 - let's just adapt this
161:25 - duplicate uh 22.
161:29 - so we're gonna duplicate this
161:31 - we are going to set the color
161:35 - to zero
161:37 - uh how do you do those ternary things
161:41 - random one
161:43 - is less than zero then I can turn it up
161:47 - right here I can never learn something
161:49 - new how about the Syntax for a ternary
161:52 - operator that I can never remember
161:54 - question mark yeah or colon I kind of
161:56 - had it right question mark color zero
162:01 - colon color 255.
162:08 - and now ironically
162:11 - I don't want the
162:13 - uh this dot color
162:16 - and let's do a square and wrecked mode
162:22 - Center
162:24 - all right
162:26 - and oh
162:34 - right oh less than 0.5
162:46 - it's pretty interesting actually
162:50 - um
162:53 - I I know this is a very loose
162:55 - interpretation of shadow
162:57 - but I quite like this okay but I had a
163:00 - thought of how to make this much better
163:03 - um so let's add something here which is
163:05 - that the dot gets a size
163:09 - I'm just using 24 and this dot r
163:14 - and
163:16 - um
163:18 - so the first dot should be
163:21 - uh
163:23 - uh shoot
163:24 - I've really
163:28 - okay hold on so if it's the first one
163:32 - other uh
163:34 - okay I got it this is very awkward and
163:38 - it absolutely could be confused
163:40 - improve R equals 100 the stud r
163:45 - otherwise this dot R equals r
163:49 - and then what I'm going to do is
163:52 - [Music]
163:54 - by the way I that was just so it didn't
163:57 - go completely insane but
164:00 - um
164:01 - and this dot R is less than
164:06 - it's greater than like five pixels
164:10 - because what I'm going to do stop stop
164:12 - stop stop is when I make it I'm going to
164:15 - say uh this dot R times 0.5 so it's
164:19 - going to okay
164:24 - why are they not actually oh the squares
164:27 - are
164:29 - why do the oh because the rotation
164:30 - sometimes
164:34 - so strange
164:37 - I really don't know what I've done here
164:39 - but this is my interpretation
164:42 - of Shadows
164:47 - I like it
164:48 - moving on
164:51 - what whoa moire
164:54 - uh okay uh uh boy this is I I really
165:00 - need to also constrain the length let me
165:02 - just fix this
165:04 - and this dot dots oh dots dot length
165:10 - is
165:12 - less than like 100. it's probably what I
165:15 - should do
165:19 - I don't understand
165:22 - why it makes whatever it makes
165:25 - but
165:27 - I'll take it uh
165:33 - this is pretty
165:35 - not what I expected and yet I really
165:37 - like it okay but I'm moving on the next
165:39 - one okay
165:41 - um what am I on 23 is more moire let's
165:46 - see if it has anything for me
165:49 - so yes okay
165:53 - so I mean
165:55 - uh oh I like this ooh interesting
165:59 - Mare
166:01 - overlapping two sets of concentric
166:04 - circles that looks nice
166:06 - okay let's just go
166:09 - uh
166:14 - okay so 400 400
166:18 - um
166:21 - no fill
166:23 - no stroke 255
166:27 - for let I equal zero I is less than a
166:30 - width
166:31 - I plus equals two
166:34 - Circle
166:37 - 200 200 I
166:45 - okay well
166:48 - uh
166:52 - okay uh
167:01 - I know we need an angle
167:14 - okay
167:16 - uh
167:25 - okay and
167:30 - let's do
167:33 - I should really have translated to the
167:35 - center here but
167:37 - what are you going to do
168:02 - oh I don't have the background on
168:05 - I wonder
168:16 - there you go I don't know what this
168:18 - looks like on YouTube
168:20 - um swap black and white I like this idea
168:25 - um
168:32 - um
168:59 - what what did I just do to ruin this
169:07 - oh
169:09 - that's plus eight okay fine
169:18 - okay done this is good kind of some
169:20 - interesting moire stuff uh let's just do
169:23 - this though
169:26 - this will be interesting
169:53 - pleased to be enjoying my moire pattern
169:55 - okay
169:58 - textile
170:00 - didn't I just do Persian rugs
170:03 - it's a textile
170:05 - uh what textile
170:08 - textile
170:11 - textile what do I do for textile
170:17 - hmm
170:21 - I like the idea of like creating this
170:23 - little tube like things I like this I
170:26 - guess to make something very texturey
170:28 - looking
170:29 - is kind of cool
170:33 - my brain is not is starting to melt a
170:37 - little bit
170:42 - oh by the way I forgot to put in the
170:44 - number for this one this was January 23.
170:51 - now uh textile
170:55 - hmm
170:57 - something with pixels
171:00 - like melting pixel neighbories
171:04 - do plaid or textile pattern Vector
171:08 - Fields good idea copy paste Persian rug
171:11 - yeah just don't do weaving okay why not
171:15 - okay how about I like the idea what uh I
171:18 - like the idea of um a flow field so
171:22 - um
171:23 - let's make a flow field
171:25 - oh wait a sec
171:27 - let's make a flow field but with my grid
171:30 - within a grid thing so which one was
171:33 - that
171:36 - oh yeah this moved everything crazy off
171:39 - of the grid so 17
171:44 - K let's start with this I gotta I got a
171:47 - weird idea here that kind of makes no
171:49 - sense but I'm going to do it anyway
171:51 - um
171:54 - textile 24.
172:00 - okay so in draw grid there is no longer
172:03 - a rectangle rather I am going to draw
172:08 - a line
172:11 - which goes from
172:14 - uh X Plus i y plus J to X plus I
172:20 - plus r y plus J
172:23 - okay
172:25 - uh and we're gonna say stroke 55 no fill
172:27 - let's just say stroke
172:30 - weight uh
172:33 - R uh divided by four just out of
172:36 - curiosity
172:38 - whoa Okay so not exactly what I meant to
172:42 - happen but it's a good start
172:45 - because this is kind of what I was
172:47 - thinking but
172:49 - um
172:51 - let's do r divided by 16.
172:55 - our r divided by 8 because essentially
172:58 - when it's the smallest I want it to be
172:59 - one pixel okay
173:02 - okay so now what I'm thinking is
173:08 - um so I'm going to need to say I'm going
173:10 - to need Loop
173:11 - gonna need to say random seed so it does
173:15 - the same
173:17 - grid within a grid I also want it to be
173:20 - I think more frequent to be perfectly
173:22 - honest
173:28 - it's funny how it's picking the top two
173:29 - twice in a row or did I just
173:34 - really
173:36 - put my thumb on the scale oh cause a
173:38 - random seed
173:41 - that's fine
173:43 - um
173:44 - that's fine
173:46 - but
173:49 - let's just get a different random seed
173:51 - there we go okay perfect okay so this is
173:54 - my textile start
173:55 - uh and now what I'm thinking of doing is
174:01 - changing this to translate X Plus i y
174:05 - plus J
174:06 - whoops not here
174:10 - remember the line is okay
174:12 - so push Matrix
174:17 - pot Matrix
174:21 - translate to X Plus then this is much
174:23 - easier now zero zero
174:26 - to R comma zero
174:28 - this should be exactly the same
174:30 - great
174:32 - and now what I would like to do is
174:37 - um
174:38 - uh
174:41 - let's get an angle
174:45 - float angle equals noise
174:49 - uh
174:51 - uh X oh this is so ridiculous
174:54 - um hold on
174:56 - hold on let's just do
175:02 - um that's fine you know what let's do
175:04 - this uh X offset equals X plus I divided
175:08 - by 100 I'm doing this late the lazy
175:12 - coder's way
175:16 - uh
175:19 - uh
175:22 - uh two pi
175:25 - times that rotate by that angle
175:35 - uh no no no no no no no no no thank you
175:37 - very much the rotate goes there
175:41 - okay
175:43 - uh not the most textiley thing ever
175:47 - but
175:55 - nothing like a little Z offset
176:07 - okay to lead the way uh
176:11 - okay I want to do it hold on
176:15 - don't like the way that I did this
176:17 - translate X plus I plus r divided by two
176:21 - plus r divided by two negative r divided
176:25 - by two r divided by two let's do it this
176:28 - way
176:32 - and stroke weight uh 10
176:38 - and oh no that's not the stroke weight
176:40 - is
176:42 - uh
176:44 - and stroke 10 and background here
176:50 - all right
176:53 - oh no whoops that's not set up
176:58 - uh
177:03 - [Music]
177:05 - wow this grid is really weird here
177:09 - so I don't know why I just didn't do
177:11 - like a regular flow feel because the
177:13 - grid is really kind of making it insane
177:16 - and there's like
177:18 - um so I have a weird idea I have some
177:20 - weird ideas to make this more textiley
177:23 - uh color would certainly help
177:27 - um
177:30 - it's very slow
177:33 - uh
177:41 - hold on sorry I'm thinking I'm thinking
177:43 - I'm thinking I'm thinking
177:46 - um
177:52 - add color and I've got it
177:55 - yeah
177:58 - uh
178:02 - okay
178:05 - um
178:17 - ah come on
178:21 - uh
178:32 - I don't know what I'm doing anymore I
178:34 - really like
178:35 - lost it here
178:42 - all right
178:46 - just stop after a set number of frames I
178:48 - also should do that right or I should do
178:51 - the um
179:03 - all right we got a nice pallet uh
179:10 - is this how you do that in Java
179:49 - all right
179:51 - um
179:55 - I'm gonna have that Alpha again issue
179:59 - um
180:17 - oh I can't put a string in there
180:36 - because I think it'll let me oh what
180:43 - is it gonna like
180:45 - is processing gonna be smart enough to
180:47 - do this
180:51 - I don't think so
180:59 - oh there we go awesome
181:25 - done this is not at all textiles but you
181:29 - could you could keep going with this
181:31 - okay
181:32 - all right we've got to look up this
181:33 - particular artist now I think I need to
181:35 - stop building off of what I did before
181:38 - um
181:40 - let's look at these
181:47 - oh bright polka dots oh amazing
181:50 - Infinity Room
181:52 - oh my God these look incredible oh wow
181:58 - wow okay so I definitely want to use
182:01 - these colors that I just got or like a
182:03 - red and a yellow this is incredible
182:07 - uh
182:09 - um oh my goodness I love this so much
182:11 - I'm never gonna be able to do something
182:13 - as beautiful as this
182:16 - um but let's give it a try
182:18 - um okay let's go to JavaScript I think
182:22 - um
182:24 - and
182:26 - let's
182:29 - um
182:30 - anyone want to give me in the chats um
182:33 - uh colors
182:35 - for this okay
182:38 - um oh you know what I want to use
182:45 - let's go to this
182:46 - coding challenge
182:50 - I really need to work on my
182:53 - Google they really should really should
182:55 - come up with
182:56 - this
183:03 - I think this could be a nice start
183:06 - okay let's
183:09 - let's use this
183:11 - duplicate
183:13 - January uh 25.
183:18 - four o'clock people let's just see so
183:20 - this is the example
183:21 - that I guess I made in that video
183:25 - uh just red blue green orange okay oh
183:28 - Emily says I got to see one of her
183:30 - exhibits in person okay so this is what
183:33 - I want to do maybe this is actually
183:36 - not right but let's give this a try
183:39 - first of all let's update this with the
183:41 - new sp5 it's a good chance for us to
183:44 - whoa okay one point 5.0
183:54 - still going okay great
183:57 - um
184:05 - I'm just curious here what are some okay
184:07 - great and then K is like 20.
184:11 - what does the K do
184:21 - I don't I I did this whole thing and I
184:23 - made a whole video about it I don't
184:24 - remember maybe this is just too
184:26 - elaborate right now
184:28 - but it is kind of a nice
184:31 - starting point what I want I think I
184:33 - have an idea though
184:35 - uh
184:37 - uh where am I drawing them oh geez
184:40 - I hate not having any room okay
184:45 - okay
184:47 - done no it's that can't be done
184:50 - for that I already made
184:52 - so let's have the colors
184:55 - be
184:57 - um
185:01 - um based on
185:09 - um so okay
185:16 - at the ordered Point uh let's get the
185:20 - distance between point dot X Point dot y
185:23 - and
185:26 - the center uh width divided by 2 height
185:30 - divided by two
185:32 - and
185:34 - um
185:35 - stroke weight r
185:37 - point and then I can say
185:40 - Point dot X Point dot y
185:44 - um whoops where did I go
185:48 - and what I want to do here is say
185:50 - palette
185:52 - equals
185:56 - um
185:57 - ff000
186:00 - ff0
186:06 - and what was another
186:10 - um it was another color like I saw
186:15 - uh red yellow
186:18 - let's just do red yellow and
186:21 - black
186:24 - and then
186:28 - um okay so what I'm thinking is
186:31 - uh then float
186:35 - and then uh int no no no let index
186:40 - equals floor d
186:44 - stroke palette
186:50 - index so I want to see like concentric
186:53 - circles
186:56 - uh and what did I miss here
186:59 - object arguments is not a valid color
187:02 - representation
187:05 - what am I missing here
187:12 - palette a stroke
187:19 - okay
187:29 - okay
187:35 - floor
187:37 - of the distance
187:39 - oh oh oh
187:42 - modulo
187:44 - palette dot length
187:51 - huh
187:52 - oh and the the black ones you don't
187:54 - really see
187:57 - um but I bet you you would if I made the
188:01 - background white
188:08 - okay and then oh it doesn't doesn't look
188:11 - good I don't like this
188:15 - and
188:17 - it's not doing what I thought it would
188:19 - do which is
188:22 - give me like nice concentric circles
188:26 - um
188:35 - yeah that there we go this is what I was
188:38 - imagining
188:40 - uh background pink
188:42 - okay
188:44 - oh also
188:46 - well that's doing anything weird but
188:50 - um
188:59 - hold on let's just now
189:07 - if it's bigger it's better
189:13 - so I uh orange instead of yellow
189:18 - I want the sizes to be bigger
189:21 - I want them to change size
189:26 - I probably should do Circle I really
189:29 - should do Circle packing not this
189:32 - I don't know what K does
189:43 - yeah that was a mistake
189:46 - restart please
189:50 - uh can I
189:54 - make R change over time
189:58 - total is 25.
190:02 - R ti times equals 0.99
190:07 - oh no no no each time you draw sorry
190:12 - oh no now they're just shrinking
190:28 - it's kind of strange I should probably
190:29 - move on
190:32 - uh
190:34 - I should probably move on
190:36 - I think actually this might look nicer
191:01 - not what I intended
191:03 - but kind of interesting
191:11 - done done the German flag now in circles
191:21 - I I have an idea
191:37 - oh it never stops
191:48 - I don't like that I started with this
191:49 - it's good enough okay
191:55 - I kind of like whatever this did
192:05 - just to understand what's going on
192:07 - better oh yeah
192:09 - awful awful okay
192:19 - just give me one more moment
192:22 - to feel better about this one I do not
192:25 - like what I've made but I I really do
192:27 - just need to move on
192:29 - um
192:36 - there
192:38 - okay
192:41 - perfect
192:42 - okay
192:45 - my kid could have made that this kind of
192:47 - works
192:48 - uh um
192:52 - my kid could have made that
192:56 - this is an interesting prompt
192:58 - okay how about
193:03 - um
193:08 - 4 15 January 26th
193:12 - um
193:13 - my kid could have made that
193:43 - I like those colors
193:46 - um
193:47 - I've kind of lost them though
193:50 - um
193:51 - I did a terrible job I feel so I was so
193:53 - excited by that one I think it
193:55 - overwhelmed me okay
194:38 - okay ready
194:46 - I made a little nice drawing program
194:50 - just a random color every time you click
194:53 - the mouse did I do something weird that
194:55 - it only is shades of blue and green
194:57 - it's never oh there we go okay
195:00 - done
195:01 - my kid could have done that
195:05 - because that's how I've taught them how
195:06 - to do that in P5 in the style of Clone
195:10 - okay
195:12 - uh January 27th I'm really getting tired
195:15 - everybody
195:16 - oh these look amazing
195:20 - okay
195:21 - um oh I like this let's do this
195:24 - let's make something that looks like
195:26 - this
195:26 - that is beautiful we can do this okay
195:30 - all right
195:31 - okay uh I will do this in P5
195:37 - uh let me close a bunch of these windows
195:42 - that I don't need anymore
195:44 - goodbye chat GPT
195:47 - okay so we are going to say
195:50 - background
195:53 - red
195:56 - then our colors are going to be blue all
195:59 - right so then let's make we're gonna I
196:02 - want it to be different each time so
196:04 - what I need is a function that draws two
196:09 - arcs
196:10 - so I'm going to write my own function
196:12 - called arcs which is not Arc
196:16 - and I need I'm not gonna work I just
196:18 - need a size
196:22 - um I need a
196:24 - size and an out a stroke and a fill
196:29 - color I know sorry for my variable names
196:33 - or actually no it's just a fill color
196:36 - so it's just a size and a color
196:39 - so a color one and color two
196:44 - so to do this I need to draw so let's
196:47 - let's just translate to the center
196:54 - and I need to draw one Arc so let's just
196:57 - make it white first
196:59 - one Arc that is zero zero R times two
197:05 - let's just make a diameter because I
197:07 - don't think the r matters here
197:09 - so diameter diameter and then zero
197:14 - zero to Pi it's probably going to be and
197:17 - then another one
197:20 - that is pi
197:23 - to 2 pi
197:27 - uh no stroke
197:31 - and a fill zero
197:37 - let's do
197:39 - um oh and so I really should be color
197:42 - one
197:43 - color two
197:45 - and I'm going to say arcs
197:49 - 100 0 255.
197:53 - Okay so
197:55 - life
197:57 - how lazy am I rotate pi divided by two I
198:02 - could rewrite my code or just do that
198:04 - okay so then this first one the back one
198:07 - should be so now I need to say four let
198:10 - I equal uh
198:12 - uh with
198:15 - divided by 2
198:17 - uh I is greater than or equal to
198:21 - 24. I
198:24 - let's just say zero I is greater than
198:26 - zero I minus equals 50. let's just see
198:32 - what this does
198:34 - and
198:36 - uh I
198:40 - okay now we're not seeing them because
198:44 - the colors are the same
198:56 - okay
198:57 - uh
199:01 - and
199:04 - um 50 seems kind of arbitrary
199:07 - uh oh well actually
199:09 - so let's
199:14 - uh oh I like how this one it could be so
199:17 - let's just pick from a few different
199:18 - colors
199:19 - so let's make a palette
199:24 - which has
199:27 - uh
199:28 - black
199:31 - White
199:36 - um oh I you know interestingly how this
199:38 - side is oh let's just do that so it's
199:41 - this side is only black or white
199:43 - and Palette one
199:46 - can only be black or white
199:49 - and Palette two
199:51 - can be uh like
199:55 - yellow
199:58 - it's like
200:00 - pink
200:02 - it's like blue like a light blue
200:08 - um blue kind of a yellowish I mean
200:11 - somebody with more talent for color will
200:14 - make a nice version of this
200:21 - it's kind of a nice orangey
200:24 - um
200:34 - okay I'm making up some colors
200:37 - uh
200:39 - uh so arcs
200:41 - random palette
200:43 - one
200:45 - random palette two
200:48 - okay
200:52 - I like this
200:55 - I like this
200:57 - we are done
200:58 - that is oh January 27 Oh my God
201:06 - okay
201:12 - boom generative poetry
201:15 - yeah
201:18 - um
201:19 - oh I have so many examples that make
201:22 - generative poetry
201:23 - so like what should I do right now
201:28 - maybe I should pick one of my I should
201:30 - just give up cut myself some slack here
201:35 - generative poetry coding train
201:42 - um
201:52 - poetry
201:54 - diastic
201:59 - all right let's create something new
202:02 - um let's use an API
202:05 - um
202:07 - so what was it that I was using that was
202:09 - like project Muse or something
202:12 - API this is it
202:18 - okay Muse
202:21 - there's something called The Muse API
202:23 - word dictionary
202:25 - something called like data Muse
202:28 - word yeah maybe this is it yes this is
202:30 - it
202:31 - okay
202:33 - um because I think this is a free easy
202:34 - to use API
202:36 - so
202:38 - um
202:42 - means like sounds like spelled like
202:44 - related word
202:48 - topics
202:50 - uh
202:51 - yeah
202:53 - uh
202:56 - bring the results
203:02 - meaning words related to duck
203:07 - so okay start with okay let's let's see
203:10 - words
203:12 - okay
203:13 - so
203:15 - let's go to P5
203:19 - new sketch
203:22 - uh January 28th
203:26 - uh
203:28 - uh we are going to ah I have an idea
203:31 - okay this is going to be the generative
203:32 - poetry thing okay great uh let's say
203:36 - okay so first of all
203:38 - give me a second here to say background
203:47 - okay
203:49 - uh
203:54 - okay
203:55 - um we are going to make a canvas
204:00 - and uh
204:04 - and
204:06 - create uh in input equals create input
204:16 - okay and uh
204:20 - why why why why why
204:23 - oh I am that is a reserved word okay
204:26 - um get
204:28 - uh user input
204:31 - poem start
204:33 - poem start okay so poem start Dot
204:39 - what is it changed
204:42 - right poem
204:46 - and then function write poem
204:50 - is going to be an async function and I'm
204:53 - going to say response equals await fetch
204:59 - I'm not going to use low Json because I
205:00 - I really want to just do this with async
205:03 - I think
205:04 - um and so now we're going to go to here
205:11 - um
205:15 - and then
205:17 - um I'm going to say let prompt
205:20 - equals poem start
205:24 - dot no right
205:26 - yeah poem start dot value
205:29 - and so here now we're going to say
205:34 - um
205:35 - whoops
205:37 - prompt
205:46 - um and then this is going to be
205:50 - asleep
205:54 - thank you
205:55 - so much oh come on just to add one
205:58 - you're insane okay
206:01 - then
206:14 - okay uh rainbow
206:20 - okay fine fine fine fine fine fine
206:28 - and I'm gonna not I'm just gonna put
206:30 - rainbow in here now so I don't have to
206:35 - and I'm actually just gonna say right
206:38 - I'll make it work eventually that and am
206:42 - I standing in front of the code too much
206:45 - sorry about that
206:47 - uh okay
206:49 - um I just wanna see if this works
206:53 - oh
206:54 - console.log Json
206:58 - okay great I got a hundred words
207:02 - fry
207:04 - okay
207:05 - yeah so uh okay
207:08 - so now I'm going to
207:20 - next let's call this next word
207:23 - poem start value
207:32 - prompt
207:35 - and then
207:40 - why doesn't this work now
207:42 - oh next word
207:46 - okay so now
207:50 - um
207:53 - I should be able to
207:58 - get any word
208:01 - from a random one so let word equal
208:05 - random Json
208:09 - uh fill 255
208:13 - and uh
208:15 - uh let x equal random with
208:18 - let y equal random height
208:22 - text
208:24 - uh word
208:26 - X comma y
208:29 - text align
208:32 - Center Center
208:35 - and it's saying object object because it
208:38 - is word.word
208:41 - word dot word
208:44 - okay and
208:47 - uh
208:48 - uh
208:49 - size
208:54 - should be uh like 64 to start
208:58 - okay
208:59 - so now the idea is that I have
209:03 - is that I would then do
209:09 - set time out
209:14 - another async function
209:18 - a weight
209:20 - next word word dot word size
209:25 - uh like 75 percent
209:28 - and then do that like no no one second
209:31 - later
209:40 - uh and then the whole thing should not
209:42 - start
209:46 - foreign
209:55 - poem
210:01 - okay
210:02 - and let's make this
210:05 - 800
210:07 - by 800
210:13 - I have so um okay hold on
210:17 - let's make this uh
210:21 - 800 800 by 600
210:26 - and okay so let's use the word
210:30 - kitten oh rotate them by 90 degrees I
210:32 - like that idea
210:40 - I'm probably gonna go and all right so
210:43 - uh
210:44 - yeah
210:46 - so I like the idea of rotating them
210:53 - thank you
210:57 - uh
210:59 - translate I'm so tired rotate pi divided
211:04 - by 2 times random
211:12 - rotate uh random one
211:15 - let's just say
211:17 - if random one is less than 0.5 rotate pi
211:22 - divided by two draw the text at 0 0.
211:28 - um I don't think the size should go down
211:31 - by very much
211:33 - so now let's try
211:35 - [Music]
211:36 - um
211:37 - uh rainbow
211:40 - hit enter
211:46 - what just happened
211:49 - did I ruin it
211:54 - next word
211:56 - prompt.value size get the word text size
212:00 - oh push Matrix is not
212:02 - the function
212:12 - did the rotate mess it up
212:20 - [Music]
212:32 - what have I done to destroy this
212:43 - push pop yes okay uh console.log word
212:48 - dot word are we getting something
212:55 - I think the event isn't happening
212:57 - anymore
213:18 - I mean this is a terrible way to display
213:20 - a poem
213:22 - but I'm not sure why my change stopped
213:24 - working
213:28 - oh maybe you actually have to write in
213:29 - it you can't just hit enter and I
213:31 - probably should have a button
213:46 - okay so now okay okay relax relax okay
213:52 - here we go ready generate there we go
213:54 - okay
213:56 - all right everyone
213:58 - this could be vastly improved
214:02 - but it was an interesting exploration of
214:04 - using this API and now we are moving on
214:07 - to
214:09 - maximalism
214:11 - maximalism that's the opposite of
214:14 - minimalism I suppose
214:21 - maximalism oh my God
214:24 - I'm so close to being done
214:26 - ah
214:27 - so close to being done uh maximalism
214:34 - maximalism
214:40 - well this could be maximalist
214:46 - like here's a way of making this
214:47 - maximalist
214:51 - but no let's not do that let's start
214:53 - over Okay let's go to processing
215:01 - oh
215:05 - maximal okay
215:07 - January 29 January 29th
215:13 - okay now
215:15 - we're definitely going to use full
215:17 - screen
215:20 - but maybe not just yet
215:29 - maximalist okay
215:31 - how about I use
215:35 - every possible polygon and every
215:37 - possible color
215:39 - okay I have an idea so where's that
215:42 - polygon function I have I just have to
215:44 - rewrite it because it'll be faster oh
215:47 - there is a polygon function in
215:48 - processing okay polygon
215:51 - processing reference
215:56 - it's an example I don't think there is
215:58 - one
216:00 - there's like a p shape
216:05 - I don't believe that there's a polycon
216:09 - okay I don't believe that there's a pot
216:11 - okay
216:12 - this is going to be maximalist
216:15 - s
216:16 - where's my polygon function let's find
216:19 - it anybody remember what day I did the
216:21 - polygon draw a grid no it was before
216:23 - that wasn't it
216:24 - 12 polygon here it is awesome
216:28 - uh here's my polygon function January
216:30 - 12.
216:35 - okay
216:37 - so
216:39 - void draw
216:43 - four okay we're gonna do every possible
216:46 - polygon
216:48 - uh and I equals one I is less than
216:53 - a 50 a gone
216:59 - no
217:01 - let's go let's just go up to a
217:05 - is it a decagon is that what 10 is
217:09 - um
217:11 - and 4 would be a rectangle so let's No 3
217:14 - would be a triangle so let's do that 2
217:16 - would be a line
217:19 - one would be a point okay maximalist
217:22 - uh um
217:39 - oh the I is first
217:46 - okay this is looking good
217:54 - okay I kind of have an idea here
217:58 - four
218:02 - int
218:04 - W equals we'll start with 100
218:09 - W is greater than we'll go down to 10.
218:15 - we'll go down to zero we'll say w minus
218:19 - equals
218:21 - 20.
218:26 - 10 20. I don't I've kind of lost what
218:28 - I'm doing here
218:31 - then we're going to say for uh x equals
218:36 - zero X is less than W X plus equals w
218:42 - aximalist Y is less than h y plus equal
218:48 - w y is nothing with some height
218:53 - uh and counter equals zero
218:59 - um
219:05 - counter
219:08 - and this is
219:11 - w
219:15 - uh
219:22 - a little grid uh
219:26 - uh counter equals counter plus one
219:33 - modulo 10.
219:39 - do I have too many oh
219:44 - okay this is this is what I was thinking
219:47 - now
219:48 - the polygon function draws it at the
219:51 - center
219:51 - [Music]
219:52 - so this should really be offset
220:02 - so if I were just doing let's get rid of
220:05 - this outer loop for a second because
220:07 - this makes no sense
220:09 - no idea what I'm talking about here
220:13 - that didn't work
220:24 - I want to draw a grid of the polygons
220:28 - what is wrong with me and I want to
220:30 - rotate through okay
220:33 - let's make this 10 for a second
220:36 - oh it's the whole oh no no it is doing
220:39 - what I think it's supposed to do it's
220:40 - just ah
220:42 - uh polygon counter plus one
220:48 - counter plus two there at least needs to
220:50 - be two
220:53 - and it should be stroke 255 fill 255
220:57 - just for right now okay
221:01 - oh wait
221:03 - okay and then
221:06 - it should be half
221:08 - the size
221:12 - okay and then
221:14 - y should be on the Outer Loop
221:18 - I'll evenly divides
221:21 - um okay so we're gonna pick a random one
221:24 - so forget about the counter
221:30 - int random between one and
221:35 - 11.
221:39 - uh
221:43 - uh no no no no
221:46 - this is very weird what I'm doing but
221:48 - it's it's gonna be maximalist you'll see
221:51 - okay
221:52 - uh so if W is a hundred this is going to
221:55 - be maximalist okay great
221:59 - now
222:03 - um what I wanted to do was this
222:11 - okay good good
222:14 - uh
222:16 - uh now the color palette is going to be
222:22 - um
222:28 - okay
222:30 - uh
222:46 - and
222:49 - um
222:53 - um
223:03 - uh how am I going to do the color
223:09 - s
223:12 - tie d t d e x d I have no idea what
223:16 - anybody's talking about in the chat
223:19 - um okay wait wait wait this is gonna be
223:21 - maximalist
223:24 - um
223:26 - okay what's I know
223:28 - color mode HSB
223:32 - uh
223:33 - uh 360.
223:35 - 255 255. okay
223:38 - so this is going to be
223:42 - just out of curiosity let me just
223:45 - check a color
223:53 - okay perfect
223:55 - now it is going to be
223:59 - um
224:01 - counter
224:04 - counter
224:11 - I'm just gonna make it a float for no
224:12 - good reason
224:16 - I mean I could make it random
224:19 - I kind of like the idea of it being in
224:21 - some sort of order though
224:33 - no
224:49 - foreign
224:51 - what have I done
224:54 - um
224:59 - am I doing the biggest ones first okay
225:01 - hold on
225:10 - okay
225:11 - this is what I meant to happen
225:16 - I guess it just covered oh you know what
225:23 - I now I understand what I wanted to do
225:27 - okay I understand what I wanted to do
225:29 - that's maximalist
225:35 - done no no no no no no
225:38 - trust me just give me a second here
226:12 - yes this is what I was looking to do
226:16 - only it's much less than I imagined so
226:21 - let's start with
226:26 - I was thinking of something different
226:28 - but this is close enough okay
226:31 - and
226:32 - now we're gonna just forget about this
226:34 - counter
226:35 - lovely idea
226:39 - let's make it horrifyingly random
226:45 - there we go maximalism
227:01 - just just bear with me
227:04 - just bear with me
227:07 - there we go maximum okay hold on
227:18 - maximalism okay moving on
227:22 - minimalism minimalism okay
227:25 - we're gonna do this one can I get out of
227:28 - here how do I get out of this
227:30 - okay minimalism
227:32 - oh my God I'm so close to being done
227:35 - three hours and 27 minutes
227:39 - okay minimalism
228:24 - no no no no no no no
228:27 - why does that not
228:31 - oh
228:38 - minimalism
228:42 - deliberately break one of your previous
228:45 - images
228:49 - and works and ruin it
228:51 - huh
228:54 - well all right folks which one should I
228:58 - do I got 30 prompts
229:01 - anybody have a have a uh request
229:09 - which one should I break and ruin
229:15 - the No No I have to do 31. I'm not done
229:18 - I'm not done
229:21 - I need to break one of them
229:24 - remove semicolon from your last one I
229:27 - mean I guess I could you know what I'm
229:28 - gonna do I'm gonna write but I try to
229:31 - ruin this one
229:32 - that's a really good idea
229:35 - uh okay
229:38 - I have a really good idea just just hold
229:40 - on
229:40 - okay
229:43 - I know how to ruin this one
229:45 - um
229:50 - so hold on uh columns is with divided by
229:56 - with
229:57 - rows equals height divided by width
230:03 - um
230:04 - hold on I'm just going to do this a
230:07 - different way
230:09 - just trust me I have a really insane
230:11 - idea
230:13 - oh wait wait wait
230:15 - uh it's fine I'm just gonna recreate
230:17 - this but write the code a different way
230:23 - and then I'll I'll move on when I plus e
230:26 - plus plus
230:41 - same exact thing
230:43 - okay that's and now I'm going to ruin
230:46 - this one
230:48 - uh so January 31
230:52 - I'm gonna make it so annoying to look at
230:56 - um
230:58 - int
231:00 - uh
231:02 - call uh just R1 equals int random calls
231:12 - and R2
231:14 - and Rose
231:16 - okay
231:17 - uh
231:19 - Translate
231:52 - there we go
231:55 - foreign
231:57 - I have ruined it
232:04 - why no did it not oh because the rotate
232:06 - I made I didn't even like not what I
232:08 - meant to do this is what I meant to do
232:16 - it's it's this one down in the corner
232:21 - it's just off like a couple of things
232:24 - I kind of love this
232:27 - I also think I should say Phil 253.
232:33 - and then stroke
232:36 - uh
232:37 - uh uh stroke weight 0.1 I mean this is
232:41 - now ridiculous now I'm ruining it too
232:44 - much it's making it too obvious but
232:51 - yeah this never mind never mind with
232:53 - that it's gonna ruin the fill slightly
232:57 - going to be like a little bit more
232:58 - noticeable
233:01 - all right I think we're good done
233:05 - three minutes 32 seconds right now three
233:09 - hours three to three hours 32 minutes
233:13 - and 50 seconds
233:15 - I have completed all of January uh all
233:19 - in this one live stream thank you to uh
233:22 - Rafael for you know really for inspiring
233:25 - me with the idea for this
233:27 - I would love to figure out a way to
233:29 - compile all of these
233:30 - I'm sure there's a nice way this stream
233:32 - could be like edited into something
233:34 - I did not record all the feeds
233:36 - separately though so I doubt I will do
233:38 - that but I would like to put everything
233:41 - up
233:42 - uh at that GitHub repo
233:46 - I'm I'm spent
233:49 - um
233:51 - I don't even I don't even know what to
233:53 - say anymore
233:55 - so I'm gonna try to document everything
233:57 - here
233:59 - um I do feel pretty good about this
234:01 - record time
234:02 - I felt like there were some good
234:04 - projects in there actually some seeds of
234:06 - things
234:07 - if anybody wants to take anything I made
234:10 - today and make something out of it I
234:13 - would be so thrilled that you have full
234:16 - permission
234:17 - to just take you know take the the
234:20 - things that I made and put them out into
234:22 - the world with your own creative Twist
234:25 - on them I'm gonna be getting a good
234:27 - night's sleep and I'll be back in here
234:28 - recording
234:30 - um my intro to coding with processing
234:33 - videos tomorrow
234:35 - and that's all I've got to say anybody
234:37 - have any last things they want to say
234:39 - this is it it's the end I don't know
234:41 - like I wish I could like run through
234:42 - them now like a screenshot of each
234:44 - anybody wants to help me compile what I
234:47 - did today into some like quick slide
234:49 - show or something I would totally accept
234:51 - that gonna try to put everything here
234:55 - um here's what I'm gonna do actually let
234:57 - me do this it's gonna need to be
234:59 - reorganized
235:01 - but
235:03 - I mean at least at a minimum do this
235:06 - let me quit processing I actually feel
235:07 - like a little bit dizzy
235:11 - so I think it's gonna be fine though
235:13 - processing
235:15 - January so
235:19 - wait a second are these from last year
235:22 - there might be some from last year shoot
235:25 - um hold on hold on ah
235:28 - I know how to use a computer
235:31 - okay no
235:32 - great these are all from today so let's
235:34 - at least do this
235:41 - so I'm gonna just upload these whatever
235:43 - they might be
235:47 - good luck on your exam tomorrow Lucian
235:51 - I'm going to commit these changes the
235:54 - rest of so here's what I would love
235:57 - and I'll work on this myself I'm not
235:59 - asking any all of you to do like free
236:01 - labor for me but I know people do enjoy
236:03 - contributing so I think I would love to
236:05 - have like a readme that has like a nice
236:08 - grid of images of everything
236:11 - then all of the code nicely organized
236:14 - and numbered so the P5 code should
236:16 - probably be linked to the web editor and
236:21 - um but maybe it makes sense to also
236:22 - include it as separate files I'm not
236:24 - sure but if you go to this URL
236:28 - that should you should be able to see
236:31 - all of the P5 uh sketches
236:34 - so
236:36 - um anybody who wants to help uh with
236:38 - this repo maybe file an issue just to
236:40 - say I'd like to work on this like I'd
236:41 - like to work on the screenshots the
236:43 - readme I'd like to help clean up the
236:47 - the processing code or help to like add
236:49 - the P5 code I'm open to anybody doing
236:51 - that
236:52 - um
236:53 - and
236:55 - um that's it I'm gonna go I'm gonna put
236:57 - on my little song where I say goodbye
237:00 - I don't know why I've just had this
237:02 - forever
237:05 - and if anybody has any questions in the
237:08 - Discord or in the YouTube chat I will
237:10 - let this play out
237:13 - um
237:14 - I feel like I should have a I should
237:17 - make a thumbnail for this video
237:19 - let's which is the most
237:23 - I really like the
237:26 - um
237:27 - definitely not a grid black and white
237:29 - one I think or sh let's look at that
237:31 - January 19th
237:33 - is that processing
237:36 - hold on
237:38 - I'm gonna make like a screenshot that I
237:40 - can use as a thumbnail
237:42 - for this video
237:48 - I hope you learned something or enjoyed
237:50 - this what was it
237:53 - black and white was 19. here we go
238:01 - [Music]
238:05 - this is going to be very artificial but
238:10 - let's try it again
238:14 - [Music]
238:19 - I don't like what it's giving me
238:24 - [Music]
238:29 - all right that's fine
238:32 - okay
238:33 - this is my screenshot
238:42 - there could use that image and
238:44 - completed January
238:46 - all 30 prompts 31.
238:54 - thanks everybody I really appreciate you
238:57 - joining me for this
238:58 - I have to admit I really didn't want to
239:00 - do it I mean
239:02 - I was feeling lazy I want to just sit
239:04 - around on the couch all afternoon
239:06 - I have a lot of work to do back teaching
239:09 - but this was really fun and I feel very
239:11 - accomplished and I've kind of also like
239:13 - was feeling sad that I wasn't doing
239:15 - January so there we go foreign
239:18 - [Music]
239:22 - so I'm gonna be here for another 30
239:24 - seconds
239:27 - three and a half hours is pretty good
239:29 - [Music]
239:30 - five o'clock
239:33 - I guess I talked for a half an hour
239:35 - before
239:35 - [Music]
239:36 - and then I I I'm wasting some time now
239:40 - [Applause]
239:42 - back hurts all right everybody that's
239:45 - the end of the song I'll see you next
239:47 - time I live stream uh join the Discord
239:50 - say hi on Twitter uh say hi in the
239:52 - comments all those things love you all
239:54 - see you in the future
239:58 - as always I always forget that this dot
240:00 - this stock this dot this dot this stuff
240:03 - this stuff
240:04 - this stop this stop this stop stop just
240:09 - stop just stop
240:11 - this stop this stop this dots
