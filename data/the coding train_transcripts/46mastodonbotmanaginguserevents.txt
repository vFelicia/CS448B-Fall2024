00:00 - (Bell)
00:01 - - Okay I am back again, ugh
so many Mastodon videos.
00:04 - This now, what I want to do is look
00:07 - at how I can deal with a mention.
00:10 - A mention is when somebody
else toots, posts,
00:13 - and mentions me, the bot,
in their message post.
00:17 - So and this will come in as a notification
00:21 - event type mention before I dealt with,
00:25 - if I look at my code,
in the previous video
00:28 - I dealt with anything that is a follow.
00:31 - So now I want to say, else
if message data dot type
00:36 - equals a mention, so
what I'm going to do is
00:43 - in this example is if
somebody says "please like or
00:48 - favor it" or something
like that, I will like or
00:50 - favor it.
00:51 - If someone says please
boost or reblog I will
00:53 - boost/reblog.
00:55 - So I'm not going to toot back but
00:59 - I am going to act on the message
01:00 - based on what the content is.
01:02 - So, the first thing that I might
01:04 - want to do is I could
use a regular expression.
01:06 - So, for example I could say, to
01:10 - make this regular expression, like
01:14 - or favorite or heart - so now I basically
01:28 - want to look and see what is the
01:31 - content - I need to look at the
01:37 - data dot status dot content.
01:41 - So I need to say, content equals
01:48 - data dot status dot content and I want to
01:53 - say, if regular expression test content.
01:58 - I am pretty sure this is a function;
02:00 - and, if I have a regular expression
02:03 - if the regular expression is matched
02:05 - somewhere within that string content
02:08 - it will return true.
02:09 - So if that is the case, I want to say
02:14 - M dot post and then - what - so I need
02:20 - to go back and look the API documentation
02:22 - because I want to favorite it.
02:24 - So if I go back here, and look under
02:27 - favorite the path to favorite it is
02:33 - statuses, the id, and favorite.
02:35 - So, I need to say statuses/ - and I
02:48 - want to make this a template
literal once again -
02:52 - I need to put the ID in here, favorite.
02:56 - This is me if it matches favorited.
02:59 - Then I need to get the id, so the
03:01 - id is under data status id, perfect,
03:06 - data status id, and there aren't any
03:10 - parameters that I need here so I
03:12 - can just go straight to the call back
03:15 - error data and - I can make a little
03:21 - function here and say
- if error console log
03:26 - console error error else
console log favorited.
03:37 - And presumably, this is going to look
03:40 - a lot like this I imagine favorited
03:43 - id so let's just do data dot id -
03:46 - I'm guessing, so just to have a little
03:49 - more info here - favorited and data dot,
03:57 - and by the way this is message dot
04:01 - data and this is message dot data - and
04:04 - this is favorited data dot id.
04:08 - So lets see here, what's wrong.
04:11 - Something is terribly wrong.
04:13 - I am out of whack in terms as my
04:15 - brackets and things.
04:18 - Oh, this also needs an end tic - there
04:20 - I go - and a semicolon.
04:22 - So apologies if this is hard to see here,
04:25 - I can move this over and give myself
04:27 - a little more space so
we can look at this code.
04:29 - Ah! (giggle)
04:35 - Let me make this font a little
bit smaller, there we go!
04:39 - So what we are looking at
here is if it is a follow,
04:43 - then we are just going to
say thanks for the follow.
04:46 - If it's a mention, we are going to see
04:47 - did the mention use the word
like, favorite or heart.
04:51 - If it did, favorite it and give
04:54 - me some information on
if it worked or not.
04:56 - So probably I should
also do something like -
04:59 - let's say - console dot log, just in case
05:06 - the message has let's
say console dot log a
05:10 - mention, a id, and then add content.
05:19 - We are going to run this!
05:21 - Whew!
05:22 - Okay, what did I lose?
05:23 - Something weird happened here.
05:25 - I also need this, ah, oh boy,
template literal come back.
05:32 - I am going to try and
reformat all this stuff.
05:36 - Ah, so sad, hold on.
05:40 - We are going to get this back!
05:43 - There we go, okay we are good again!
05:45 - Here we go, here's our
code - we've got it!
05:47 - If you mention me, check to see
05:49 - if you like, favorite or heart
05:50 - and if so, I am going to favorite it.
05:54 - So, here we go - run this bot
05:56 - and see if we have any errors.
05:59 - Okay it started, alright
better start mentioning me!
06:02 - Try mentioning me with a heart,
06:07 - with a like, with saying favorite or not.
06:11 - I will just wait.
06:13 - (dings and upbeat music)
06:17 - - Oh what is going on?
06:18 - This isn't right!
06:20 - Ahhhh something bad is happening!
06:26 - (music stopped)
06:28 - My console logging is crazy.
06:31 - What happened here - did I
put a break point by accident?
06:34 - I did not mean to do that.
06:36 - (buzzer)
06:38 - So, by the way we are at an awkward
06:40 - edit point because it didn't work,
06:42 - some weird stuff happened, but I now
06:44 - discovered through the
thankful helpful people
06:47 - in the chat that I have a few errors here.
06:49 - So, number 1 let's go back
to the API for a second,
06:54 - and I didn't pay close
attention because it
06:55 - is actually spelled with a "u" here.
06:58 - Id/favourite, so this seems kind of
06:59 - important that I spell it correctly.
07:02 - So let's fix that here.
07:04 - The important place is here and
07:07 - then a couple of other things:
07:08 - I want to use a flag for "i" for
07:14 - case insensitivity and the "u"
07:18 - should be optional here,
it really doesn't matter.
07:25 - I'm still not sure if this
is the right kind of heart.
07:26 - Now, this should fix that!
07:29 - I should now actually
be favouriting things.
07:31 - So, we are going to try this again.
07:34 - I'm going to go back to here and
07:36 - I'm going to run this bot
again and I'm going to wait.
07:40 - (upbeat music)
07:45 - I'm back and a lot of people mentioned me.
07:47 - Let's go take a look
at the actual timeline.
07:51 - We can see it is favoriting
and we can get an id out.
07:55 - You can see that this id is different from
07:57 - this id and some people
are asking about that.
07:59 - Let me mention that in a chat in a second.
08:02 - Let me go here, "You're my
favorite" hmm how come it
08:07 - didn't get favorited, ah
because I've got to refresh.
08:11 - Okay, this got favorited because
08:13 - it has favorite in it, and this got
08:15 - favorited because it's got a heart, uh
08:17 - this got favorited because
it's got the word like.
08:19 - I'm looking for one that doesn't
08:20 - have - ah, this must have been
08:22 - from a while ago when it wasn't working.
08:24 - But, we can see here -
please like, please clap -
08:28 - so, please mention me without using
08:32 - like, favorite or heart to make
08:33 - sure that also works.
08:35 - Okay I'm back and we can see here that
08:38 - kwichmann wrote @codingtrainbot Choo choo
08:41 - and after refreshed was not favorited.
08:44 - So it is working only if - I go back
08:50 - the code - only if this regular
08:53 - expression matches will I favorite it.
08:55 - By the way, we can really quickly now
09:02 - just also copy and paste this whole thing
09:04 - and say boost or re blog or retweet
09:13 - or, lets get another emoji
in here, control option if
09:18 - you use a train emoji or if you use
09:23 - the train emoji then we will reblog.
09:28 - Now, if I quickly run this again
09:30 - I will make this regex2 and I don't need
09:39 - to get the content or id anymore
09:42 - and I don't need this
again; and, it probably
09:45 - makes sense for me to
actually put it, actually
09:49 - it would be okay because
they both can happen.
09:51 - So, here now, this will boost anyone
09:53 - that says boost, reblog,
retweet, or the train.
09:58 - I'm mentioning this is a mistake here so
10:00 - this data dot id, this
is the id of the actual
10:07 - favorited action - which
every action has an id.
10:12 - If someone mentioned that has
10:15 - and id, which I captured up here
10:17 - but this is the id of the
actual act of favoriting it.
10:20 - So, debugging wise, I don't know
10:21 - which is more important to display.
10:23 - I could display both of them, but you
10:26 - will see these are two different things.
10:28 - And this should say re blogged and
10:31 - this should say favorited.
10:33 - So let's now do this and here we go!
10:41 - Everybody you can now ask to
be favorited or re blogged.
10:46 - (music at ultra fast speed)
10:55 - A lot of mentions came in, you can
10:57 - see some things are being favorited
10:58 - and re blogged, some things
are being re blogged.
11:01 - Let's go take a look at the timeline.
11:10 - Oh yeah, "I love trains",
this got boosted.
11:14 - @codingtrainbot got boosted.
11:17 - This one, "re blog this I want
the followers!! Like it too!
11:21 - We got both a re blog and a like.
11:24 - Hooray!
11:27 - We now have a bot that both just
11:31 - checks for follows, mentions, and if
11:36 - somebody follows it toots
back "welcome aboard"
11:42 - to that account and if somebody mentions
11:45 - and uses any of these key words
11:47 - it either favorites or re blogs.
11:48 - So the things that I didn't do,
11:49 - which I will add to this, I don't know
11:53 - if it makes sense to keep adding to this.
11:57 - I'll do another video
where I will add this.
11:59 - But, you might want to
try this as an exercise.
12:01 - What about actually replying?
12:03 - What about posting and actual
reply back to the person?
12:06 - If the person asks, what
is the meaning of life?
12:09 - Then, the Bot replies with a random
12:11 - number or something like that.
12:13 - Give that a try - I'll add
that but in the next video.
12:17 - Goodbye!
