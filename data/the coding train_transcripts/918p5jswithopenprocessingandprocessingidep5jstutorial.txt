00:00 - hello here's another video about other
00:03 - ways to create p5.js projects other than
00:06 - the now deprecated out-of-service so to
00:10 - speak p5 just desktop editor but don't
00:12 - worry soon when I have more gray hair I
00:15 - will be here in a video hopefully with
00:17 - the creator of what's the upcoming p5
00:20 - just a web editor to show you that and
00:22 - how you can make p5 just project with
00:24 - this new editor that's coming out soon
00:25 - but while I'm here in this video I'm
00:27 - gonna show you two wonderful projects
00:29 - made by the processing foundation
00:31 - community and one is called open
00:35 - processing so open processing is
00:37 - actually a p5.js web editor and it's a
00:40 - project that's been around for a while
00:42 - created by Sanada Show glue and I
00:44 - apologize Zenon if I did pronounce your
00:46 - last name correct
00:47 - I'm correctly I'm sure we get lots of
00:49 - comments here about how I botched that
00:50 - but Zenon originally created open
00:53 - processing as a way to share processing
00:56 - sketches which are Java applets and he
00:59 - recently launched a new design I should
01:01 - really have seen on come in and present
01:02 - this sometime on the channel but and so
01:06 - it's a great way that you could quickly
01:08 - mock up a p5 just sketch in the browser
01:10 - and then have it to share so the only
01:12 - thing that I've done before making this
01:14 - video is go to open processing org
01:16 - itself and sign up for an account so I
01:19 - actually signed up for I already had an
01:21 - account by signed up for a new one just
01:22 - for this YouTube channel called coding
01:24 - train and so once you've signed up for
01:27 - account and go to your page you can make
01:28 - a profile and do all that kind of stuff
01:29 - that I'm sure you can figure out but
01:31 - really what I'm interested in is the
01:32 - fact that making a sketch is as easy as
01:34 - this button create a sketch so let's
01:37 - make a sketch create a sketch so now I
01:40 - have a sketch and the fonts a little
01:42 - small but I can zoom into it for you can
01:43 - see it's a very simple sketch it just
01:45 - did an automatic template for me I can
01:47 - obviously add lots of code and do
01:49 - different things and I can you know just
01:52 - to do something I'm going to change the
01:53 - background to a slightly purplish color
01:56 - I'm gonna play it to see how it looks
01:58 - and you can see here's my sketch it's
02:00 - filling the background with one color
02:02 - and it's drawing a lot of ellipses I can
02:04 - how do I get out of this now ah there I
02:09 - go so I have to go up to the top and
02:11 - then a little menu appears
02:13 - and I what I want to do is this button
02:15 - looks like this button will go back to
02:16 - the code so now I'm back to the code
02:18 - this button will go back to the sketch
02:20 - okay then I can also hit save and then I
02:23 - can give it a name like coding train and
02:26 - I am on the youtubes training juju you
02:38 - interact with the mouse and then I can
02:41 - do is hit submit and there we go I have
02:47 - my coding train p5.js sketch and I have
02:50 - this link which I can send to anybody to
02:53 - share so that they could see it and use
02:55 - it as well so that is a really quick way
02:57 - also to create sketches in the browser
02:59 - through an online site like open
03:02 - processing and share those sketches
03:03 - instantly so that's that's one let me go
03:06 - I'm just gonna do two in one video
03:07 - that's what I'm doing so another way
03:10 - that you can do p5 just sketches is you
03:12 - can actually go and get processing now
03:14 - processing is a project that's been
03:16 - around for since 2001 it's a Java based
03:19 - platform I do do a lot of videos that
03:21 - use processing and if you watched my
03:23 - intro to p5.js that kind of referenced
03:25 - the relationship between processing and
03:27 - p5.js their sibling projects part of the
03:29 - processing foundation so if you go to
03:32 - processing org and you go to download
03:36 - you can get to a download page where you
03:39 - can download the processing desktop
03:41 - application for your particular
03:43 - operating system now what this is meant
03:45 - for you to do is then write processing
03:47 - code and run desktop applications but it
03:50 - so happens that Ben Frey and fathom
03:52 - information design been try being one of
03:54 - the creators of processing created mode
03:56 - for the processing editor so let me open
03:58 - the processing editor here it is so this
04:00 - is what it looks like it normally would
04:01 - expect you to write your Java code in
04:03 - here your processing code and run it and
04:05 - that sort of thing but over here up in
04:07 - the top right corner you'll see there's
04:10 - this little box that says Java and you
04:12 - notice I can switch to Android and
04:14 - Python now those won't necessarily be
04:15 - there by default those are modes that
04:18 - I've added through this
04:19 - mode option there there there are ways
04:22 - of writing using processing to write
04:24 - code in a different language for an
04:26 - android application or for writing your
04:29 - code in Python I'm going to add another
04:30 - mode it's going to open up this window
04:32 - and this is the one that I want p5.js
04:35 - mode adds a simple editor for p5.js code
04:37 - by Favot information design so now I'm
04:40 - going to install that they're going to
04:43 - wait for it to download download
04:45 - download downloading downloading
04:46 - downloading downloading downloading
04:47 - downloading downloading down that's the
04:49 - song it's the downloading song I really
04:54 - I've really excited there and now it's
04:58 - ready and I can't remove it I should be
05:02 - able to go and switch to p5.js and look
05:05 - at this it redid my window it gave me a
05:08 - little setup and draw even have an
05:10 - index.html file and I can say create
05:14 - canvas 400 400 I can say background 200
05:20 - comma 0 comma 255 and then I can draw a
05:23 - circle here where the mouse is to do my
05:29 - first sketch and I can hit run and then
05:32 - it goes to the browser and opens up and
05:34 - once again here if I want to if I want
05:38 - to look at the results I'm sorry if I
05:42 - want to see what's happening in the
05:43 - console just like I showed in my
05:45 - brackets tutorial if I want to see any
05:46 - print statements I've got to look at
05:48 - that javascript console in the browser
05:49 - so I can I can get to that by saying
05:51 - view developer JavaScript console or I
05:54 - can use a keyboard shortcut to open that
05:56 - up and close it ok so those are two
05:59 - other ways that you can make p5.js
06:02 - sketches you can use the brackets editor
06:04 - which I showed in a previous video and
06:05 - in this video I've shown you open
06:07 - processing and the processing p5.js mode
06:10 - so if you have questions or trouble with
06:12 - these things please write it in the
06:14 - comments and I look forward to hearing
06:17 - what you end up making and hopefully you
06:18 - enjoy using these tools good bye
