02:10 - [Music]
02:20 - do
02:22 - [Music]
03:56 - hello good afternoon this is just a
03:57 - quick sound check
04:00 - uh we'll be getting started in about two
04:01 - or three minutes
04:03 - let me know if you hear
04:06 - me and if the sound is coming through
04:08 - okay the music might be a little bit
04:09 - louder than my voice which
04:10 - right now is fine
04:14 - [Music]
05:42 - [Music]
05:50 - me
05:58 - [Music]
06:41 - hello and welcome to a saturday
06:43 - afternoon coding train episode
06:46 - without a train whistle or a bell
06:48 - because i've been spending all this time
06:51 - getting myself ready ready to be here
06:53 - live on the internet streaming and
06:55 - talking to you
06:55 - my friends my the people around the
06:58 - world who are
07:00 - for whatever reason i don't know why
07:02 - listening to me talk right now
07:04 - and usually i blow a train whistle or i
07:06 - ring a bell to start things off
07:09 - and i have no idea where i put those
07:10 - things which is kind of
07:12 - an interesting thing to note because
07:15 - yesterday
07:17 - which was friday today saturday i was
07:19 - actually in
07:20 - the tutorial recording studio where i
07:23 - make all of the sort of sequenced
07:24 - content that is on this channel
07:26 - and i did not have the bell when the
07:28 - train was still there either
07:31 - and yet um let me see if i can dig those
07:34 - up let me find them hold on we'll be
07:35 - right back
07:37 - i mean i won't be i'm gonna still be
07:39 - here i'm standing up
07:48 - [Music]
07:56 - as you can see this is an incredibly
08:00 - professional operation that i've got
08:02 - going here
08:05 - super prepared and organized i've got
08:08 - like a teleprompter there's like a
08:09 - production team of people
08:11 - all on the other side of this camera all
08:13 - working furiously
08:14 - to keep this show afloat
08:17 - no it's just me in the attic with my
08:20 - train whistle
08:21 - and my bell alright here we are
08:24 - i'm really excited about today
08:27 - and uh what the the the way that i'm
08:30 - doing the coding train now
08:32 - and so far my plan has been set into
08:34 - motion and it's working out well welcome
08:36 - to any new viewers
08:37 - this is a youtube channel that has both
08:40 - uh sequence tutorials about programming
08:42 - the computer
08:44 - as well as live streams from my
08:47 - attic of my home in brooklyn new york
08:50 - where i waste an incredible amount of
08:52 - time
08:53 - not being able to figure things out that
08:54 - i'm trying to figure out uh
08:56 - this show is incredibly high production
08:58 - value
09:01 - and super organized i've been planning
09:03 - it all week
09:05 - uh it's so much so that i now i have
09:06 - sponsors who i would like to just
09:08 - briefly shout out
09:10 - um thank you to brilliant uh brilliant
09:13 - is a wonderful website to help you
09:14 - stretch your mind and try all sorts of
09:15 - puzzles it's where i get actually many
09:17 - of my coding challenge ideas these days
09:19 - and also thank you to notion uh for uh
09:22 - sponsoring the coding train notion if
09:24 - you are a coding drain member
09:25 - and you received something in the mail
09:27 - recently you received it
09:29 - because i got myself organized on notion
09:31 - which is a productivity tool that you
09:33 - might want to check out um
09:34 - that you can check out at bitly notion
09:36 - coding train okay
09:37 - now back to my uh camera here what
09:41 - i'll come back and talk about those
09:42 - sponsors a little bit later a little bit
09:44 - more
09:44 - but what am i going to do today today my
09:47 - goal
09:48 - and i've literally done absolutely
09:50 - nothing to prepare for this
09:52 - i haven't even like i'm actually going
09:54 - to attempt to hang it on the wall
09:56 - behind me during this live stream that's
09:57 - how much i am going to attempt
10:00 - to program the everyday calendar now i
10:03 - have a bad feeling now the everyday
10:05 - calendar
10:06 - i have a bad feeling this is not going
10:07 - to work out and i'm doing something else
10:08 - but at least this is where i'm
10:09 - this is my starting idea and um
10:14 - an octopus member octopus do you have
10:18 - your own random number
10:19 - i don't recognize your name in the
10:20 - discord member chat
10:22 - um fortunately i've got my other camera
10:25 - right over here
10:27 - pointed at my random number digit book
10:29 - and just in case
10:30 - octopus if you don't have your random
10:33 - number
10:34 - i'm going to give you one right now
10:35 - thank you for being a member of the
10:36 - coding train
10:38 - as you know with your membership of the
10:39 - coding train you get your very
10:41 - whoa wait
10:48 - where's my buzzer
10:52 - look this is a camera
10:56 - over here that's frozen on an image of
10:59 - the millionaire
11:00 - legit book is it disconnected what
11:02 - happened here let me see if i can fix
11:03 - this
11:04 - uh i'm just going over here to my
11:06 - console here where's my i'm waiting
11:08 - because uh nothing is working music
11:14 - um let's see here how do i do this
11:18 - [Music]
11:20 - let's try this
11:24 - oh look here i am twice now if i put
11:26 - this back
11:28 - there we go a live
11:31 - picture of the book it is working again
11:35 - remember octopus your name is very
11:39 - clever it's a pun
11:40 - i think or else you just have misspelled
11:42 - octopus which would be fine because
11:45 - why why does it matter how you spell
11:46 - octopus i like to spell octopus
11:49 - [Music]
11:52 - so cute and once again i've got about
11:55 - five seconds to give you a random number
11:57 - which is
12:00 - 13957 that's your very own random number
12:02 - i'll probably give it to somebody else
12:04 - by accident because i can never remember
12:05 - these things but nonetheless
12:08 - thank you for your support of the coding
12:10 - train
12:12 - my way my family downstairs i can think
12:14 - they can hear me i think they've been
12:16 - completely lost yet
12:18 - none of them watched this if they did
12:22 - they already think that i'm completely
12:24 - nuts which i am now uh the other thing
12:25 - that i'm excited about is i've got my
12:27 - hue lights again
12:29 - um i at a minimum i should be able to
12:31 - control them from my
12:34 - telephonic device over here and no
12:37 - that's
12:38 - a wrong button and i'm going to go over
12:41 - here
12:42 - and i can make pretty colors
12:45 - and all sorts of things happen now i
12:47 - believe
12:48 - if somebody signs up to be a member i'm
12:51 - not suggesting
12:52 - that you need to do um
12:55 - that they will blink but we'll have to
12:56 - wait to find out
12:59 - all right now
13:04 - right right ah so but before i go
13:07 - and work on the project
13:11 - for today saturday by the way i'm
13:13 - calling this i need a theme song
13:14 - this is called saturday side projects
13:17 - with the coding training all my side
13:18 - projects in my live streams on saturdays
13:20 - before i start to work on the everyday
13:22 - calendar which is a
13:24 - beautiful uh piece of art i would say
13:27 - but um
13:28 - that's an extra calendar that uh has all
13:30 - sorts of wonderful features and
13:31 - qualities and is very unique that i'm
13:32 - going to show you in a minute and try to
13:34 - hang it on the wall behind me it's going
13:36 - to be really funny
13:38 - um it's made by simone
13:41 - yetch and uh simone's name last name
13:45 - she's
13:46 - swedish is spelled g-i-e-r-t-z
13:49 - and for what i understand it's
13:50 - pronounced yet
13:52 - so hopefully simone i'm pronouncing your
13:53 - name correctly thank you i mean i paid
13:55 - for this but thank you for making it it
13:57 - is beautiful
13:58 - it is bringing me much joy i'm gonna put
14:00 - it up over here and see if we can
14:01 - program it
14:03 - uh in a little bit before i get to that
14:05 - i like to start off every saturday
14:08 - side side project saturday it's kind of
14:11 - like wacky wednesday
14:13 - with a
14:19 - community contribution yes that's right
14:22 - your contributions to the coding train
14:24 - the things you've made with code
14:26 - can sometimes be featured right here by
14:30 - me
14:31 - on the internet
14:35 - now normally i'd have a green screen and
14:37 - i'd be floating in my laptop but
14:39 - because i want to play with the everyday
14:41 - calendar i don't have the green screen
14:43 - up right now
14:44 - let's bring up this web browser
14:50 - we're gonna go to i don't know where to
14:53 - find it
14:54 - [Music]
14:56 - oh i think if i go to
15:00 - the github repo there's an issue
15:04 - [Music]
15:08 - somewhere along here
15:12 - uh wheel wheel wheel link
15:16 - there we go all right so what this
15:19 - is uh thank you to gypsy dangerous from
15:21 - the coding train community who helped
15:22 - put this together
15:23 - um it is a wheel that i can spin
15:27 - and it will land it's b it's pulling all
15:29 - the different contributions that are on
15:30 - the website and i don't know if i need
15:32 - to explain this
15:33 - every single time i come live but if i
15:35 - go here
15:36 - to any given video on the coding train
15:38 - for example the marching squares video
15:40 - there are a whole bunch of projects and
15:42 - versions that people have made of their
15:44 - own
15:44 - uh and um you can add your own version
15:47 - and find
15:47 - information about how to do that i
15:49 - encourage you please it brings me such
15:51 - happiness and joy to see the things that
15:53 - you're making
15:54 - um and then they get populated into this
15:57 - wheel
15:58 - so let's look at at least two
16:01 - i should have another wheel which i
16:03 - first spin to determine how many to look
16:05 - at and then i spin the wheel
16:07 - to look at that many that's an idea all
16:08 - right here we go
16:10 - um
16:15 - and by the way anyone wants to
16:16 - contribute to this as ideas to improve
16:18 - this system that i have uh connect
16:22 - with um
16:25 - um david tripsy dangerous
16:28 - and um we'd love your contributions to
16:31 - the wheel as well hearing audio twice
16:32 - right now
16:34 - that's i believe that's only marcus's
16:36 - issue so hopefully it is let me know
16:38 - remove and view selected we have now
16:41 - i don't know about this the wheel
16:44 - is rigged
16:48 - that's what i meant to press david
16:51 - snyder
16:53 - the creator of the wheel a little
16:55 - suspicious i think that david snyder's
16:58 - contribution came up first today
17:00 - but i know i know the randomness of the
17:03 - wheel is pure
17:04 - as pure as my book
17:07 - i don't i don't know why i have those
17:09 - there i was just if i get really stuck i
17:10 - could just work on solving them
17:12 - uh my random number book um
17:16 - let's go back here let's take a look at
17:17 - david's floating point snake
17:19 - oh so this is from this particular
17:21 - coding challenge about
17:22 - forward kinematics um
17:26 - from quite some time ago let's take a
17:27 - look at it
17:30 - oh it's a video do you hear the audio
17:33 - i think you do let's let's enjoy this
17:37 - for a minute
17:43 - i hope i'm not gonna have an issue with
17:45 - the copyright of this music
18:00 - [Music]
18:05 - i turned the music off you're probably
18:06 - still here through the mic though
18:19 - [Music]
18:48 - [Music]
18:51 - this is wonderful thank you for sharing
18:53 - this um yeah you're right you might be
18:54 - hearing the music doubled unfortunately
18:56 - i didn't get it together
18:57 - usually i have an earpiece in where i
18:59 - can hear the music you're hearing
19:01 - instead it's actually just coming out of
19:02 - the speakers so in addition to coming
19:05 - out of it
19:05 - being actually sent to the live
19:07 - broadcast it's also coming out of the
19:08 - speakers into the mic
19:09 - although i haven't turned off right now
19:10 - now it's doubled
19:12 - um wonderful work and that is a really
19:17 - um lovely way to document it um
19:20 - uh thank you for that usually um i lo
19:22 - you know
19:23 - one of the things that can be tricky to
19:24 - do especially if you're creating a
19:26 - project that's not
19:28 - um interactive code running the browser
19:32 - keep it quiet down there
19:36 - emily's being very loud um
19:39 - hold on i gotta mute my mic
19:47 - brief intermission i'll be right back
20:14 - what i say about this professional
20:16 - operation that i've got going on here
20:18 - okay thank you david snyder um
20:21 - um you know that reminds me a lot i
20:23 - guess this is probably an obvious thing
20:24 - um uh about uh it reminds me of of the
20:28 - slither.io game which is uh quite a fun
20:30 - game to play thank you for that
20:31 - wonderful work
20:32 - let's go and find another one
20:38 - [Music]
20:40 - we'll look at one more or you can't see
20:41 - it
20:43 - i'm all messed up oh i'm not even in the
20:48 - picture oh
20:49 - i'm doing the worst job today
20:52 - number 68 okay
20:56 - let's see what it is this is interactive
21:00 - viewing angle starfield by aman
21:03 - ahmad ahmadi and i don't know if i
21:06 - pronounced your name correctly
21:07 - hopefully i did it is a beautiful name i
21:09 - love that your initials are
21:11 - aaa that's very wonderful and
21:14 - i know this starfield coding challenge
21:16 - because the star-filled coding challenge
21:18 - is actually the first
21:19 - one that i ever did and it is from
21:23 - um how do i get to it on youtube
21:27 - uh i thought there was a way i guess i
21:30 - can just i'm just curious i want to see
21:31 - the date of it
21:32 - this is from april 16 2016. look how
21:36 - young i am oh what a handsome young
21:40 - man boy you were back then sonny
21:45 - okay anyway uh different glasses i like
21:47 - these glasses better
21:48 - all right uh oh remember the days of the
21:51 - timer
21:52 - speaking of the timer no
21:55 - that was a disaster right okay let's
21:57 - take a look at
21:58 - um almonds uh version
22:04 - oh where did this where did this go this
22:07 - took me to almonds twitter
22:09 - uh oh
22:13 - oh i i because i linked i clicked on his
22:15 - name oh and now
22:17 - oh so sad oh i am so sad
22:21 - this brings me this brings me terrible
22:24 - sadness
22:25 - i think we might be able to actually
22:27 - find this
22:28 - um if anyone um if anyone wants to do
22:32 - any detective work to figure out if this
22:34 - link of this project is available um i
22:37 - would love to see it i kind of have a
22:39 - way but i just i don't want to bite
22:41 - that i might be able to see um no
22:44 - sketches
22:44 - hmm all right well i don't think i'm
22:46 - going to be able to find it we're going
22:47 - to have to spin that wheel
22:49 - again sorry amen uh please if you want
22:52 - to if you could resubmit
22:54 - your uh project to a new link that would
22:56 - be fantastic
22:58 - uh here we go let's spin that wheel
23:02 - again
23:05 - oh and i'm not even in the picture
23:14 - oh number 10.
23:18 - let's take a look at this project it is
23:24 - what is going on here
23:28 - something is rotten in the state of
23:30 - denmark
23:35 - and something strange is a foot at the
23:37 - circle k
23:43 - i i didn't we also look at this one i
23:45 - think we might have looked at this one
23:46 - last yeah didn't we look at this one too
23:47 - it's wonderful it's a nice uh
23:52 - um oh no i i mean i've looked at it but
23:54 - this is solving a maze with a star
23:56 - david snyder we've looked at too much of
23:58 - your wonderful work on this
23:59 - uh live stream today we're gonna move on
24:04 - and we're gonna spin one more time
24:07 - what's going on here
24:09 - [Music]
24:14 - yes um
24:21 - says no rotten here i know i know there
24:24 - is nothing rotten
24:25 - rot in the state of denmark for reals uh
24:28 - all right remove the number 23. let's
24:30 - see let's
24:30 - yeah this is going here all right oh
24:33 - this is a p5.js
24:34 - port of the rubik's cube
24:38 - coding challenge look at this uh whoa
24:40 - what is going
24:42 - i think the i just realized that the
24:45 - chroma keying is actually on
24:48 - uh filters chroma key okay i'll turn
24:51 - that off since there's no so now here is
24:53 - whoa what is going on
24:58 - filters ah my light fell
25:02 - down oh no everything is some
25:05 - everything is wrong everything is
25:07 - falling apart
25:09 - filters chroma key there we go
25:12 - i did not realize the chroma key was on
25:14 - here's the rubik's cube
25:16 - let's take a look at the p5.js port by
25:18 - zl25 drexel
25:22 - oh awesome this was by the way uh one of
25:25 - the more popular projects that i worked
25:27 - on
25:28 - it probably fits pretty well into like
25:30 - this new side project saturday thing
25:32 - that i'm trying to do
25:33 - it is also one of those projects that
25:35 - i've just left
25:36 - lingering in the wind uh you know the
25:39 - idea was to start working on
25:41 - solvers for it but really all i got to
25:44 - was the visualization of it
25:46 - at all um but and i have this idea that
25:49 - could i use a genetic algorithm
25:52 - to solve a rubik's cube and i actually
25:54 - worked on it on my own like in the
25:55 - middle of the night
25:56 - this was probably like a year or two ago
25:57 - like i don't remember when i originally
25:59 - did it but like months later
26:00 - and i actually started to get it to work
26:02 - and this is the technique that i did
26:04 - i didn't try to have a genetic algorithm
26:08 - solve the rubik's cube let me let me
26:10 - talk about this for a second this is
26:11 - kind of interesting and since i have
26:12 - rubik's cube here with me
26:14 - this camera is like frozen again
26:17 - like useless camera here i'll just uh
26:21 - i can just hold that up to you so what i
26:23 - did is i
26:24 - i know the beginner's method which is
26:26 - one method to solve the rubik's cube i
26:28 - don't know if i'm using the correct
26:29 - terminology
26:30 - but where you first maybe for me the
26:32 - first thing you do
26:34 - is oh my lights are blinking whoa
26:40 - welcome to lori hey
26:45 - with your coding train membership you
26:48 - have one
26:49 - a possibility of someday in the future
26:51 - getting a custom coding
26:52 - rubik's cube because it's a thing i
26:54 - really want to make and i think that i'm
26:56 - going to try send gifts once a year to
26:57 - people
26:58 - and i had this idea that that would be a
27:00 - fun thing to look into
27:02 - but really thank you so much for your
27:05 - support it means a lot
27:06 - and your random number is
27:10 - 39 350.
27:15 - okay yeah octopus is saying um
27:20 - oh um almonds project has been found so
27:24 - i'm gonna take a look thank you for
27:25 - uh david snyder for your detective work
27:28 - um
27:29 - i forgot what i was saying
27:31 - [Music]
27:33 - but um i really i should return to that
27:35 - project keep me on let's let's
27:37 - we'll get there someday we're gonna get
27:38 - there let's make 20 20 21 look
27:40 - 2020. i don't know if you've noticed
27:43 - it's kind of a crappy year
27:45 - i mean that's like the understatement of
27:46 - the century
27:48 - so let's hope that things improve in
27:50 - 2021
27:52 - not that the world operates on a year by
27:54 - year basis but we've got to reset with
27:56 - if we can reset and and and bring some
27:59 - um togetherness and health and equity to
28:02 - the world in ways that don't exist right
28:04 - now
28:05 - that would be an excellent thing and
28:07 - maybe also
28:08 - we'll finish that rubik's cube project
28:10 - all right
28:14 - now what was i doing i want to go
28:17 - to these i think it's the star field
28:20 - challenge page
28:22 - so i'm going to go to coding challenges
28:23 - and scroll all the way down
28:26 - to the very bottom the very first one
28:27 - what's really sad is i oh you don't see
28:29 - that
28:30 - i haven't made a new one of these since
28:33 - um
28:34 - april march
28:38 - 2020 so there's actually only four years
28:40 - so 16 17 18 95 years i guess
28:42 - of um well i didn't do any really in
28:44 - 2020 but
28:46 - there's there's not the coding
28:48 - challenges have really been on hold i
28:49 - got to get back to that
28:50 - uh to the challenge let's look at the
28:52 - community contributions
28:54 - we're trying to find uh almonds
29:00 - how come i don't see it oh here we go
29:02 - interactive viewing angle star
29:04 - field uh let's click on that
29:08 - oh oh this was so worth it
29:12 - awesome so i guess the idea here is that
29:16 - i can move the mouse around and i can
29:18 - change sort of the view
29:19 - then it gives it kind of this parallax
29:23 - 3d like feeling to it now i recall when
29:25 - i did
29:27 - the challenge it was entirely
29:30 - done with 2d math so of course
29:33 - everything ultimately if you're
29:34 - displaying on a screen is
29:35 - two-dimensional
29:36 - but 3d 3d rendering is just the illusion
29:40 - of three-dimensional perspective using
29:42 - matrix math really
29:44 - so the question is when i say did i i
29:46 - didn't use a 3d renderer a built-in one
29:48 - i just computed some
29:50 - kind of math myself to make the things
29:52 - move out from the center in a way that
29:53 - gives it a 3d like quality
29:55 - and i believe if i switch this to full
29:58 - and i go to here we can see that the
30:00 - same is true here why am i not logged in
30:03 - as the coding train
30:06 - the same thing is true here and i know
30:09 - that because
30:10 - uh if i go down to create canvas
30:14 - there is no um the webgl renderer is not
30:16 - being referenced
30:17 - so wonderful work and look at this oh
30:21 - hey for
30:22 - each loop
30:27 - why is that not working low battery
30:30 - [Music]
30:33 - oh for each loop you are so beautiful
30:37 - you make elegant ways of iteration
30:41 - look look at that arrow it's an equals
30:44 - it's a greater than
30:45 - the p is the variable that just tosses
30:50 - itself into
30:51 - this little section between the brackets
30:53 - it is each one of the stars
30:56 - for each star
31:00 - i don't know why i can't get myself to
31:01 - use them
31:03 - 2021 the year of the 4-h loop
31:06 - [Music]
31:08 - okay am i trying too hard i think i'm
31:12 - trying too hard
31:13 - um
31:17 - star flight plays right i think he has
31:19 - lost it i have news for you starflight
31:21 - i lost it a long time ago
31:28 - all right we've got to move on everybody
31:32 - we have got to move on everybody
31:37 - [Music]
31:38 - so thank you amen i'm glad we were able
31:41 - to find that
31:42 - i'm going to close a bunch of windows
31:44 - here and we are going to
31:45 - look up every day calendar
31:50 - it's four o'clock um so i got this
31:53 - through
31:54 - uh kickstarter um and
31:58 - here is uh i guess you can get one now
32:01 - this is just me this is not a sponsored
32:04 - or any type of collaboration or anything
32:06 - i mean i'm like a little tiny youtuber
32:08 - compared to the giant
32:10 - that is simone yetch um but this uh i
32:14 - guess i would encourage you
32:15 - if you want to have a little beauty in
32:17 - your life um
32:18 - and um enjoy creative and artistic uses
32:22 - of technology i would certainly
32:24 - encourage you to get one
32:25 - but you can also just kind of watch me
32:27 - fumble my way through trying to program
32:29 - it so let's take a look at it
32:30 - i unboxed it last week
32:33 - and right here if i hold this up to the
32:36 - camera
32:38 - let's see if it'll focus focus focus
32:41 - people you can't see there's a usb port
32:43 - and i believe there's some sort of
32:44 - arduino or something in it so
32:46 - project number one i can't believe i'm
32:48 - gonna do this on live stream
32:50 - is i'm gonna try to mount it to the wall
32:52 - like right about here
32:54 - right that way you can see it behind me
32:56 - as i'm trying to program it
32:57 - well it's a good idea i mean i could
32:59 - probably save the fact that it's gonna
33:01 - just like i could probably just like put
33:03 - it on the table and put the camera on it
33:06 - and save myself like an hour of pain
33:08 - because i meant to mount it this morning
33:10 - but it's a beautiful day i went to the
33:13 - park with the kids we
33:14 - did some bike riding played some catch
33:17 - uh
33:19 - kept good physical distance away from
33:21 - everybody else wore our masks
33:23 - and i didn't get back from that trip to
33:25 - the park until about
33:27 - uh 2 45 p.m about 45 minutes between i
33:31 - needed to start live streaming and
33:33 - my children they like to use this setup
33:35 - that i have here to play
33:37 - roblox so i had to like find all my
33:39 - equipment plug it all back in get the
33:40 - camera set up so i had no time
33:43 - none whatsoever but um apparently so
33:47 - apologies in advance but let's let's see
33:49 - if we can i i need your i need your
33:51 - support here like this is me
33:54 - doing the thing that i am most afraid of
33:56 - which sounds a little bit weird
33:58 - but coding is a thing that i'm
33:59 - comfortable with now i mean it's
34:01 - confusing it's tricky to have a hard
34:02 - time with it
34:03 - i am not good at mechanical physical
34:06 - things
34:07 - but it has these wonderful keyholes in
34:09 - them and i have this whole
34:11 - i found in my basement i went down to
34:13 - the basement
34:14 - um i'm a person with an attic and a
34:16 - basement
34:18 - there's also like a little bit of space
34:19 - to live in between those two things
34:22 - and i got where is it
34:27 - i have this i really
34:30 - should need to get this camera working
34:32 - hold on we're going to get this camera
34:34 - working
34:35 - uh we might not just have to do it again
34:37 - the silly thing that i for some reason
34:39 - keep having to do
34:41 - where i make it oh wait is it working
34:44 - no i make it first i make it this
34:48 - and then i put it back to this
34:52 - there you go so there's the calendar so
34:53 - i have these
34:55 - so i have some screws i have some
34:57 - anchors i also have a drill
35:01 - so first thing first though what's
35:02 - wonderful about
35:04 - this is it comes with
35:07 - your very own like guide and the guide
35:10 - has the keyhole spots and i even have
35:12 - a level a level of the thing
35:18 - so where's that level i saw it
35:22 - so what do i do now
35:26 - i get like a little like i got a sharpie
35:29 - do i poke my right little
35:30 - if i do this like what about here is
35:33 - this good let me go back to the
35:35 - larger camera like about here
35:38 - this is good now i should move it over
35:40 - i'm going to put it in the middle
35:41 - actually
35:42 - i'm going to put it here i mean i'm not
35:43 - going to measure centering it
35:46 - and then that's not level
35:51 - now that's about level
35:54 - now how do i write with a sharpie
35:58 - through the paper
36:00 - is that a thing you can do maybe i get
36:03 - something to poke it
36:04 - poke it there'll be a little mark in the
36:06 - wall oh but
36:07 - but but i can't reach anything because
36:10 - i'm holding it there
36:11 - oh i could get some tape i got an idea i
36:13 - have tape
36:16 - look at the level doesn't seem to be
36:17 - there anymore i have gaff tape oh no
36:20 - no no no no i moved it okay everything's
36:23 - gonna be okay people
36:24 - this is literally what you're watching
36:26 - just just maybe go
36:28 - go if if you live somewhere it's
36:29 - beautiful out and you have a mask and
36:31 - you can be
36:32 - appropriately distanced from people
36:33 - maybe go do that and come back
36:35 - about four or five hours i might have
36:37 - like got the screw in the wall
36:39 - possibly
36:43 - it's side project saturday here i should
36:46 - probably play some music while i'm doing
36:47 - this because
36:50 - what's hilarious is how i'm trying to
36:51 - make it level and yet i'm doing
36:53 - basically nothing else that any normal
36:55 - person would do
36:56 - okay that looks like a good spot now i
36:59 - could just get myself a piece of tape
37:03 - no i turned it okay okay maybe i
37:06 - shouldn't
37:06 - worry about it being level so much wait
37:09 - let me get the piece of tape
37:10 - first if we if we get the piece of tape
37:13 - first i could just screw through the
37:16 - hole marks
37:17 - that's such a good idea oh because i
37:19 - have a drill i'm gonna use a drill
37:21 - okay but first i need to tape it to the
37:24 - wall
37:28 - i want it to be level
37:39 - this is also just a temporary place for
37:41 - it because i don't think this is a good
37:43 - place to have it in my house um
37:46 - i'd rather have it somewhere where it
37:49 - could be seen more often although i
37:51 - guess it's nice to have it behind me if
37:52 - i'm live streaming but not if i brought
37:54 - up the green screen
37:55 - okay so now
38:00 - now let's do a little simulation this is
38:02 - known as
38:03 - one of the things i like to program are
38:05 - simulations and i'm now doing a
38:06 - simulation
38:07 - of me programming the everyday calendar
38:11 - and you can see it behind me there right
38:14 - so that should work
38:16 - okay we know that breaking breaking news
38:19 - breaking news
38:24 - breaking news straight from the discord
38:26 - chat
38:27 - cutting trade members simon said
38:31 - we know the kind of arduino it's an
38:33 - arduino pro or pro mini
38:35 - and i guess if i go to get lab
38:40 - um if i go to get lab.com
38:43 - simone yetch
38:46 - um this would be good because i've never
38:49 - used git lab
38:50 - and this will be a nice experiment to
38:53 - try to learn that as well
38:55 - um we'll be able to start to program it
38:58 - all right now i got to get my drill
39:02 - [Music]
39:03 - all right i need to have various
39:05 - emergency numbers
39:07 - available case anything goes wrong
39:12 - do i need anchors i don't know
39:16 - i thought i should put some anchors in
39:17 - the wall
39:23 - generic drill from generic unnamed
39:26 - non-sponsor company
39:33 - okay can you i assume you can still hear
39:35 - me even though i'm away from the
39:36 - microphone
39:38 - electricity
39:41 - okay now if i'm going to use
39:48 - where where is
39:51 - my where was that thing where i had the
39:53 - screws and the anchors
39:55 - where did i put that why can't i keep
39:58 - track of anything
39:59 - i just had it in my hands two seconds
40:01 - ago where did it go
40:04 - hmm literally headed my oh there it's on
40:07 - the floor okay
40:09 - all right so if this what do we think
40:13 - um maybe the me the middle one i think
40:15 - i'm gonna go for the middle one
40:17 - i mean i don't think i need something
40:18 - that huge right
40:20 - um oh this cam this is ridiculous this
40:23 - camera is like
40:24 - useless why do i even bother
40:28 - i wonder if so sad i don't know why i
40:31 - was having such a problem
40:34 - um the whole point of this setup that i
40:36 - had was to have this camera that was
40:38 - going to make it much more interesting
40:39 - and entertaining
40:41 - let's try it one more time
40:44 - this is very frustrating you can see my
40:46 - professional operation here as i
40:48 - mentioned
40:49 - um if i just like
40:54 - so i think what i'm going to use are
41:00 - one of these with this
41:05 - so i just need a hole in the wall
41:09 - like here and it goes in
41:12 - and then i screw the screw in yeah
41:16 - what do we think people now the question
41:19 - is
41:21 - what size drill bit maybe somebody can
41:24 - help me with this
41:26 - i literally never do something so not
41:28 - handy
41:30 - i aspire to be handy and i just am so
41:32 - not
41:33 - i can't i can't even open this okay hold
41:36 - on
41:39 - oh i by the way i've totally lost
41:44 - okay so these are the drill bits
41:48 - uh what do we think is that the right
41:50 - one no like more like this right or do i
41:52 - need to go bigger
41:54 - i have no idea how do i know well maybe
41:57 - i'll just try a smallish one like this
42:02 - it probably works right what do we think
42:10 - i like in the chat i'm noticing somebody
42:12 - saying
42:13 - talking about mongoose and javascript
42:15 - which is so far from what i'm doing
42:16 - right now
42:17 - okay so i'm going to put this drill bit
42:20 - in
42:21 - i think the way that i do that is i take
42:24 - this i put it in here
42:27 - and then i tighten this
42:36 - right this right okay
42:45 - um
42:48 - okay so now i'm going to try to make a
42:50 - hole shut anybody want to tell me to
42:52 - stop
42:54 - doesn't look very level to me at all
42:56 - believe this
42:59 - i still had time leveling it look
43:04 - i mean where's my left
43:24 - so
43:27 - i should have taped it on the edges
43:28 - clearly
43:35 - this is a temporary location so i'm not
43:37 - too worried
43:40 - use the leveling app in my phone that's
43:42 - interesting
43:44 - all right here we go
44:05 - there's no way this anchor is going to
44:07 - fit into that hole
44:09 - i'm going to need a much bigger
44:12 - uh drill bit
44:15 - or a smaller anchor
44:18 - i think i think that anchor is a good
44:20 - size
44:21 - so let's get a larger drill bit
44:27 - let's see what time you stop
44:31 - size of the bit should be written on the
44:33 - mounting things
44:38 - that's interesting
44:42 - this says
44:48 - 6x30
44:51 - is that what it says oh you can't see
44:53 - that
44:55 - 6 x 36 i can't so let's get a larger
45:00 - drill bit and this says
45:09 - it has something written on i just can't
45:11 - see it
45:13 - 38 i think it says 38.
45:18 - so hard to read
45:22 - let's try it
45:29 - this really shouldn't take this long i
45:31 - was gonna do this this morning
45:33 - this is a great live stream
45:41 - i'm enjoying the chat
45:46 - all right let's try this
45:55 - i think that might be the right size it
45:57 - looks kind of
45:58 - like this could fit in there
46:02 - am i supposed to get like a hammer and
46:04 - like hammer it in probably
46:06 - i mean i guess i should take let me do
46:07 - the other hole
46:16 - [Music]
46:29 - okay two holes
46:33 - i do have a hammer
46:42 - this might be more of a hammer than i
46:44 - need
46:46 - 16 ounce rubber mallet is what this is
46:57 - i think i need a bigger hole i think my
47:00 - hole is not big enough i gotta go one
47:01 - more bigger
47:04 - or just like wiggle it around
47:10 - look at this which size is this
47:14 - so small let's try this one
47:23 - oh there's 410 people watching this and
47:26 - i i don't even have my camera set up in
47:27 - such a way that you can see me
47:35 - this is the everyday this is a very
47:37 - weird i like that
47:38 - uh uh three darius costa right
47:42 - this is a really weird coding challenge
47:43 - it certainly is you can see how
47:48 - how incompetent i am
47:57 - i'm gonna feel so accomplished if this
48:00 - actually is hung on the wall by the end
48:02 - of this live stream
48:11 - it should really just like slide right
48:12 - in there shouldn't it because then when
48:13 - you screw the screw in it expands
48:16 - so i i'm just afraid to like
48:20 - drill a huge hole
48:24 - where are the yes this is the home
48:26 - improvement show
48:29 - i'm sure my sponsors are going to be
48:30 - thrilled to have selected this episode
48:34 - um you know
48:37 - this is called incremental develop this
48:39 - is how i do software i
48:40 - incrementally make small changes
48:58 - like seriously all right we're just
49:00 - going we're going all in
49:05 - going all in here's the largest
49:08 - drill bit i have
49:14 - push it in push i'm supposed to push it
49:15 - in
49:18 - oh look at that marcos did some fancy
49:20 - like photoshop
49:25 - i think at this point
49:30 - i need to just really get it in there
49:35 - by pushing it in there we go got it
49:41 - anchors away all right anchor number one
49:45 - is in
49:47 - let's finish this hole
49:52 - something bad happened
50:03 - [Applause]
50:06 - anchors away
50:14 - anchor number two is in there this is
50:16 - this is things are looking up people
50:18 - now i just need to put these screws in
50:20 - now should i be doing this with
50:22 - a screwdriver or should i get some sort
50:26 - of uh
50:27 - i have like the things that are the
50:29 - screw things that go on the drill i'm
50:30 - not really sure
50:36 - let's try doing it by hand first
50:39 - oh here's another here's a regular
50:41 - regular hammer here okay
50:42 - so now what i have
50:47 - are
50:53 - i really hope i get to the arduino part
50:54 - of this where's my screwdriver i don't
50:57 - know where i put it out here it is
51:00 - what are these things called these
51:02 - things have a name
51:03 - i have no idea what they're called
51:05 - they're like the thingies that go
51:07 - on the thingy top thingy um
51:12 - small drill i only that's the only drill
51:14 - i have
51:16 - so let's try
51:19 - let's look which size this is
51:25 - looks like that fits it well most these
51:28 - all seem to fit it
51:29 - i don't know what's best let's try this
51:34 - one
51:37 - i can't get it out there we go
51:41 - so i'm going to
51:44 - put this here and then used to go
51:50 - let's see all right now we are going to
51:54 - screw this in now how far
51:57 - out of the wall does it need to be in
51:59 - order for the thing to hang on it
52:01 - that's my question and i'll switch this
52:04 - so you can see
52:06 - not that you can see this really up
52:07 - close but like it's got to be sticking
52:09 - out right so it just stick out like a
52:11 - small
52:12 - bit i guess the amount
52:16 - that's on the calendar
52:20 - um whereas i put the calendar i can't
52:22 - find
52:23 - i didn't think that they i was too tall
52:24 - for the camera once i'm doing this i
52:26 - guess
52:26 - you know what here i can sit
52:30 - then you i can you can see me and i can
52:32 - just wheel my chair over here
52:35 - and i could talk to you in my home
52:37 - improvement show like this
52:40 - but it's a little bit harder to screw
52:42 - the wall from down here
52:44 - all right let's
52:47 - let's stop it there so it's about
52:51 - yay out of the wall and i need one more
52:55 - to go into
53:02 - uh now i need this one
53:07 - all right i have to stand up sorry
53:09 - people
53:12 - then i have a costume change because i
53:14 - actually got a t-shirt also with the
53:15 - everyday calendar i feel like i should
53:17 - change into that t-shirt
53:18 - to really go you know whole hog with
53:22 - this
53:23 - live stream do need to do my sponsor
53:26 - segment soon is it four
53:29 - four twenty two oh no no no i started at
53:30 - 3 30. i haven't hit an hour i was
53:32 - confused i thought four o'clock was the
53:33 - hour but i'm good
53:35 - okay so the question now is how
53:38 - far should these go in because when i
53:41 - get the calendar
53:44 - which i don't know how we put it over
53:47 - here
53:50 - right if we look at this
53:53 - oh you don't see that i bet you the
53:55 - camera's not gonna be working anymore i
53:57 - think every time i switch away from it
54:00 - yeah every time i switch away from the
54:01 - camera it like when i come back to it
54:03 - it's not working i don't know if this is
54:04 - an obs
54:05 - problem might be an obs problem um
54:10 - so i don't know how far in but let's
54:12 - just try it
54:16 - i have to take my hat off because i
54:18 - cannot see
54:19 - with my hat on where i'm putting it in
54:24 - monkey holes i can find you
54:32 - come on keyhole
54:35 - see you there we go
54:39 - oh it's a little bit
54:43 - out of the from the wall i think i did a
54:46 - pretty good job
54:50 - i think i might have done it i don't
54:52 - think it's gonna fall
54:54 - i think i got it all mounted on the wall
54:57 - huh
54:58 - oh my god oh
55:01 - i love it i feel like
55:05 - i feel like this
55:05 - [Music]
55:11 - i hope everybody's just sharing this
55:13 - haul on social media with simone yet
55:15 - i'm sure she's gonna be really thrilled
55:20 - uh okay
55:27 - all right uh here we go all right we're
55:31 - gonna start programming it
55:32 - we gotta start programming it i gotta
55:34 - clean up um
55:36 - give me a minute to uh clean up and
55:39 - enjoy
55:40 - the um polar cartesian song
55:48 - [Music]
55:56 - i'm gonna say once again here we go
56:02 - [Music]
56:14 - coordination
56:21 - [Music]
56:28 - wait i have to put the plug in and the
56:30 - usb
56:31 - cable should i've done that before i put
56:33 - it on the wall probably
56:45 - [Music]
56:56 - coordinates
57:03 - how about um
57:09 - as always i always forget that this stop
57:11 - this stop this stop just stop i'm gonna
57:13 - leave
57:13 - this stop this stop this this stock stop
57:16 - get stopped
57:17 - this stock will stop i just stopped
57:30 - [Music]
57:51 - [Music]
58:06 - this dot
58:13 - this dot song never forget this dot
58:16 - somebody composed that song for me
58:18 - i plugged it in oh oh that just lit up
58:22 - i don't know how much you can see that
58:24 - it just lit up
58:25 - um can you see this is another thing i
58:28 - didn't really think of
58:29 - which was why it'd be great to have this
58:32 - camera working but i have another
58:34 - camera hold on let's some um
58:38 - bruno is saying obs has an option
58:40 - deactivate when not
58:42 - showing i wonder if that's what has been
58:45 - selected so let's go to this
58:46 - [Music]
58:48 - um
58:50 - drawing view it's called drawing because
58:52 - that's what i
58:54 - uh look at and then if i go to the
58:56 - properties of the i
58:58 - piezo camera i don't see defaults
59:02 - deactivate and it's not a live picture
59:05 - right now
59:08 - configure i mean uh
59:11 - where is that property um
59:15 - oh whoa
59:18 - now that just going to the properties
59:21 - and then hitting okay reactivated it
59:24 - so that makes sense where is that
59:26 - property i don't know where that
59:27 - property is
59:29 - um but anyway uh
59:33 - what was i why was i oh because i could
59:34 - do this
59:37 - and it's upside down
59:42 - but potentially i could get
59:46 - a better view of it
59:49 - um like this
59:53 - you could see the uh the light the ring
59:56 - light reflecting in it that's not a
59:57 - thing that i thought about
59:58 - although you know i might prefer to have
60:00 - that off right now
60:04 - well i'm quite in the dark but it's
60:07 - better for seeing this why is it
60:09 - look like it's so not level okay let's
60:12 - see if i can do that
60:14 - that's better you can see it better and
60:16 - in fact what i could do here
60:19 - is continue to crop it even more
60:24 - um and then make that a little bit
60:28 - bigger for you
60:32 - so like for example like this
60:36 - there you go i can move myself like here
60:39 - and here we are okay so now
60:43 - the property should be under properties
60:45 - in the camera source and just under
60:47 - configure video
60:48 - should be a check box right there saying
60:51 - deactivate when not showing
60:54 - so i'm going to go to properties in the
60:56 - camera source
61:00 - and then just under configure video
61:03 - no deactivate when [ __ ] when not showing
61:05 - is not selected
61:07 - so i don't know why that's happening all
61:10 - right this is good
61:11 - my setup is pretty good it's a little
61:12 - bit i do have this light
61:14 - so if i want it to be a little brighter
61:16 - myself i suppose
61:17 - i could turn this light on and i could
61:19 - put it like
61:21 - here um
61:24 - that way there's a light on me oh it's
61:26 - kind of in the shot
61:28 - um there's a bit of a light on me but
61:30 - you're still able to see the calendar
61:32 - pretty well
61:33 - and i should be able to uh
61:37 - touch these so what's be wonderful about
61:39 - this is if you push and hold
61:42 - they turn on and off
61:48 - so the idea is that if there's something
61:49 - i want to do every single day
61:56 - oh god and of course the camera is not
61:59 - shoot i just rolled that over my foot
62:02 - why why
62:03 - camera why must you torture me
62:07 - it's so weird
62:10 - that update it no
62:13 - jeez this is making me crazy why does
62:16 - nothing ever work
62:17 - configure yeah
62:26 - then of course now i have to like do you
62:28 - think it's like a loose connection
62:31 - whoa and why oh i ain't just in a
62:32 - different place now
62:39 - i wonder if it's you know what i have an
62:41 - idea i have this plugged in through this
62:44 - usb
62:44 - hub and maybe the usb hub
62:49 - is a problem
62:53 - so i'm actually going to unplug this
62:55 - camera oh i don't think i can reach
62:57 - this cable is not long enough i do have
62:59 - usb extenders but the whole point of the
63:00 - usb extender so i was going to use it
63:02 - for the
63:03 - everyday calendar shoot do i have more
63:06 - than one usb
63:07 - extender
63:11 - i don't know that i do should have
63:14 - brought more than one usb extender
63:17 - um what's this
63:21 - oh this is a usb what else is plugged in
63:24 - here no
63:27 - okay i have an idea i have a good
63:31 - if you will bear with me what's plugged
63:33 - in here
63:34 - the microphone
63:40 - all right it's too much stuff plugged in
63:42 - everywhere
63:44 - let's just try a different usb port on
63:46 - this hub
63:47 - maybe this port is bad
63:55 - let's try unplugging this
64:00 - apologies for all this technical
64:03 - difficulty
64:05 - but i'm gonna hope now
64:11 - aim the light source at the ceiling oh i
64:13 - don't have i do have a white
64:14 - i have a tin i'm in an attic with a like
64:16 - angled tin
64:17 - ceiling if i had confidence in this
64:19 - camera i would show it to you
64:21 - um thank you for your lighting
64:22 - suggestions
64:24 - um let's see if
64:28 - this works i do have another webcam so i
64:31 - think what i'll do
64:32 - is if this continues to give me trouble
64:34 - i'll just use a different webcam
64:37 - but if you want to see the ceiling this
64:40 - is i'm in an attic and that's the tin
64:42 - ceiling of the attic uh
64:45 - i would show you the rest of this attic
64:46 - but it's such a mess it's all just piles
64:49 - of
64:49 - stuff everywhere all right now here we
64:52 - are
64:55 - so what i should be able to do now is
64:58 - this usb
64:59 - cable you know what i don't necessarily
65:02 - need the extender it's pretty
65:03 - long although i i that's kind of awkward
65:06 - to wrap it around like me like this so
65:08 - let me get the extender
65:10 - so that we don't have a
65:13 - crisis oh and oh it's four
65:17 - it's four three i gotta take my sponsor
65:18 - break in a minute
65:23 - um
65:31 - i don't even have arduino installed on
65:33 - this computer so this should be
65:34 - interesting
65:36 - to see what happens now i've got this
65:39 - usb
65:40 - cable so i'm going to take a short break
65:43 - and then we're going to have the rest of
65:44 - the time to really program this thing
65:46 - but let me at least get it plugged in
65:48 - and see if we can see that it shows up
65:51 - i'll try to get that much through
65:59 - okay so now what can i do here
66:02 - to be super fancy with my setup so if i
66:05 - go to here
66:07 - right this is me and i think what i'm
66:09 - going to do now
66:10 - look at this add
66:14 - the um add
66:17 - video capture device that's what i'm
66:19 - adding right
66:20 - the this webcam and then
66:23 - now i can uh crop around it
66:34 - what layout
66:37 - magic is this
66:43 - so hopefully now you see
66:48 - me here that's the camera
66:52 - that's it by i guess i could have put it
66:54 - i didn't need to put it behind me i
66:55 - could have put it on the wall over there
66:56 - if i'm just gonna like but i like that
66:57 - it's behind me okay
66:59 - all right coffee coffee time
67:03 - checking the chat uh this is really
67:06 - really fun
67:07 - i'm so excited about this um i'm gonna
67:10 - have to take a quick break in a second
67:16 - let me make sure these properly show up
67:22 - it's not working here we go
67:28 - course my stream deck is no longer
67:30 - working so strange
67:34 - yeah everything has to break all at once
67:37 - um let me just move this o
67:40 - back down here um
67:46 - there we go that's what i was trying to
67:47 - check
67:51 - all right i'm going to do this stuff
67:52 - manually
67:55 - all right so now what do i need to do
68:02 - connecting the everyday okay so first i
68:04 - need to get this
68:05 - [Music]
68:06 - to download the firmware and schematic
68:08 - files run the following
68:11 - command so this i know how to do because
68:14 - it's stuff that i do all the time
68:16 - i'm in the software phase where i'm a
68:18 - bit more confident than all of this
68:20 - hardware and hanging stuff so let's go
68:23 - to the desktop
68:25 - let's clone that repo what
68:29 - oh let's clone that repo
68:36 - and
68:40 - there it is now let's open up my desktop
68:44 - and i've got it let's go to um
68:50 - and let's uh open it up in visual studio
68:54 - code
68:56 - so i can see what's there
69:00 - so there's all sorts of images and
69:02 - there's the schematics
69:04 - which is really these are pdfs so
69:06 - there's the license and the readme
69:08 - and firmware sketches
69:12 - so it looks like there are various
69:15 - things that i can test
69:16 - running on it but i'm going to want to
69:18 - program my own
69:19 - stuff for it my goal by the way is to be
69:22 - able to walk in front of it and have it
69:23 - be a mirror of me
69:24 - so as i like move my body around i'll
69:27 - see myself reflected
69:28 - a la um danny rosen's
69:31 - wooden mirror if you're not familiar
69:34 - with this
69:35 - is a piece by danny rosen from 1999
69:39 - um which has a whole bunch of
69:43 - wood uh chips that uh
69:46 - move on servo motor motors down and up
69:49 - down and up and right there in the
69:50 - center is the camera although now he
69:52 - uses a connect a depth sensor with it
69:54 - um and it reflects when they're pointed
69:56 - up there's a light pointed down it
69:57 - reflects the light when they're pointed
69:58 - down they're dark
69:59 - so i want to do something similar and i
70:01 - think
70:03 - dare i say i know who this person is but
70:05 - anyway
70:06 - um moving along okay open the arduino
70:09 - ide
70:10 - what's the chance that i have arduino
70:12 - installed on this computer
70:15 - nope so uh arduino little known fact
70:19 - the arduino ide is based on the
70:22 - processing ide
70:24 - so what do i do get the oh am i supposed
70:27 - to use arduino create now is that
70:28 - something new
70:30 - or um there's a web editor can't maybe i
70:33 - just want the
70:34 - i'm afraid to use the web editor can i
70:36 - still get the downloadable
70:37 - what's the what's happening these days
70:39 - let me go to idb.nyu
70:42 - this is the program where i teach
70:44 - there's a physical computing class
70:46 - uh let's see what they're supposed to do
70:47 - in this class
70:49 - uh syllabus lessons let's do class one
70:53 - um
70:56 - say i'm break board i don't know if
70:57 - there's an arduino yet uh
70:59 - class two microcontrollers the basics
71:04 - uh yeah microchips microchips arduino
71:08 - adreno arduino there we go
71:10 - arduino adreno am i supposed to use the
71:12 - web thingy
71:15 - does that not exist anymore the ide that
71:17 - you download and run
71:21 - i'm looking at the chat now uh
71:26 - we're discussing whether you should
71:28 - arduino create or the arduino app
71:31 - um i don't i don't know that i need to
71:33 - do a poll
71:35 - i just want to use
71:39 - i want to use the app because i feel
71:40 - like i'm more going to be more
71:41 - comfortable with that but i don't see
71:43 - where i get that downloads
71:46 - okay sorry it's really obvious i should
71:48 - just get it here
71:49 - i'm gonna download this um i
71:53 - i i do think it's meaningful to
71:55 - contribute but i'm not going to right
71:57 - now
71:59 - uh later okay this is downloading
72:02 - all right 42 seconds left i can work on
72:05 - my rubik's cube a little bit while i'm
72:06 - waiting
72:12 - first you make the daisy that's my
72:15 - favorite part because daisy is a pretty
72:17 - flower
72:21 - then i make the
72:24 - cross somehow i made the daisy perfectly
72:28 - without not intentionally then i do the
72:30 - edges
72:30 - do the download nope can i can i uh
72:34 - can i manage to solve this before
72:38 - um
72:45 - before it finishes downloading probably
72:48 - not
72:53 - oh there we go
72:57 - do love a good rubik's cube um
73:00 - now i'm going to do the second layer
73:11 - the download it's still downloading
73:15 - more of the second layer
73:25 - won't be winning any competitions
73:26 - anytime soon
73:29 - other than the coolest dad award
73:37 - [Music]
73:38 - and here we go still working on the
73:41 - second layer
73:41 - have i downloaded all right we'll come
73:44 - back to this rubik's cube
73:46 - i've got you i've got i've got gotten
73:47 - pretty far here but
73:49 - gotta get back to this arduino stuff um
73:52 - now let's open up the arduino
74:00 - did i mention my mug has math formulas
74:02 - on it
74:03 - uh there we go
74:09 - i'm gonna use the app god this ipad that
74:12 - has all my music and sound effects
74:14 - on it is about to die um let's see
74:18 - so now uh what do i do
74:22 - open this up
74:26 - oh i did that already maybe put this in
74:29 - applications
74:30 - maybe put the arduino as like a thing
74:33 - here that i could click on
74:35 - and run it all right
74:39 - arduino is an app download from the
74:40 - internet are you sure you want to open
74:42 - it yes
74:47 - so now this is what's based on the
74:50 - processing id i mean it looks
74:52 - quite similar let's make the font size
74:57 - a little bit bigger that's way too big
75:01 - let's try with 24. okay so
75:04 - all right pausing for a minute here
75:08 - let's say you're kind of new to this and
75:10 - you're lost
75:13 - just new to this being new to this live
75:15 - stream i have something called the
75:17 - everyday calendar it is a
75:18 - a beautiful calendar
75:21 - made and built by simon yetch you can
75:24 - order it online
75:25 - i got mine through kickstarter you can
75:26 - still get them it has
75:28 - a it is it is an amazing feat of
75:31 - engineering and design
75:32 - that i won't go into and you can learn
75:34 - more about it but
75:36 - it has an arduino in an arduino is a
75:38 - microcontroller you know a miniature
75:39 - computer essentially
75:40 - has a bunch of pins and things it gets
75:42 - electricity it sends electricity in and
75:44 - out you can write code that runs on it
75:46 - and the code that you run on it is c
75:49 - code
75:50 - so this might be a momentous occasion it
75:53 - could possibly be the first time that
75:54 - i'm writing c
75:55 - code on the coding train ever i don't
75:58 - know if that's true
76:00 - the coding train historians is there a
76:02 - coding trait historian
76:03 - there's a opening coding train historian
76:08 - uh so uh next uh simon is giving me
76:11 - thankfully some tips here
76:12 - next up so anyway so what i want to
76:15 - attempt to do is write some code
76:17 - that i will then put onto the arduino
76:19 - board in there to make my own patterns
76:21 - or run my own software on there
76:23 - and i'm about to take a short break just
76:25 - because i've been streaming for about an
76:27 - hour and 15 minutes so far
76:29 - um and then i've got then i'll come back
76:31 - and spend another hour i might spend
76:33 - quite a while trying to get this to work
76:35 - so that's where i am um
76:39 - and here we go open uh what do i do now
76:42 - tools
76:45 - what am i looking for board arduino uno
76:49 - select the board okay board is arduino
76:53 - pro
76:53 - pro mini so i have to select that
76:58 - i don't see that as an option
77:03 - is it auto detecting it by any chance
77:06 - well let's look at the instructions
77:09 - because there were nice instructions
77:15 - select the board arduino pro is right
77:18 - there
77:18 - prower pro mini okay okay
77:22 - tools serial monitor sketch
77:27 - tools board
77:32 - how come i don't see it board manager
77:37 - do i have to get more
77:41 - oh this is like a thing that i like add
77:43 - other boards i'm so lost
77:45 - i've never done this this looks like by
77:48 - the way the web one
77:50 - maybe i should go back to the web one
77:57 - because i'm not seeing it show up here
78:01 - my mouse was right over it the whole
78:03 - time
78:06 - [Music]
78:10 - i'm looking at it i see it i see it
78:15 - by the way i'm known in my family as the
78:16 - person who can't find anything
78:18 - like i'll literally be like where are my
78:20 - keys where are my keys
78:22 - i can't let my keys they're like right
78:23 - in front of my face i give by the keys
78:26 - so apparently this happens also here you
78:28 - know you're live streaming it's a hard
78:29 - thing it's very awkward you feel like
78:31 - stupid all the time
78:32 - arduino pro or pro mini got it
78:38 - finished
78:43 - next step configure the processor and
78:47 - clock speed
78:48 - to atmega328p all right
78:51 - i have no idea what that means
78:54 - processor oh it looks like it's already
78:56 - set to that
78:58 - oh no wait i don't remember what it was
79:00 - thr at mega328p
79:06 - 3.38
79:08 - 3.3 v 8 it's this one
79:11 - so configure it to that okay got that
79:14 - installing arduino's library is copy the
79:17 - contents of this
79:18 - repository's firmware to the library's
79:21 - directory on your computer's arduino
79:23 - libraries folder okay
79:27 - so what i'm looking for is in here
79:32 - this folder needs to go to
79:35 - documents arduino libraries so this
79:38 - looks like
79:40 - uh all the libraries that are here
79:43 - i need to install them here
79:46 - so now oh except i don't wanna i don't
79:48 - want a folder called libraries inside of
79:50 - libraries
79:51 - i just want this so i'm gonna move this
79:53 - back
79:54 - get rid of this it's a good sign okay
79:57 - done that
80:00 - to test and see if the custom libraries
80:02 - are working can run our sample code
80:04 - provided in the firmware sketches
80:06 - directory simply upload one of the
80:08 - sample code files into the calendar
80:09 - using the arduino ide open the serial
80:11 - monitor and set the baud rate
80:13 - to 9600. all right you ready for this
80:19 - you ready for this okay
80:23 - uh here we go um so arduino
80:27 - open desktop
80:31 - uh everyday calendar sketches
80:37 - which one do i which one do i run
80:41 - our sample code upload one of the sample
80:44 - code files
80:46 - everyday calendar let's do that one i
80:48 - guess
80:52 - i kind of want to run this one that's
80:53 - called test i feel like that feels like
80:56 - that's useful let's run the
80:57 - test one so this is
81:02 - the test one
81:06 - uh it does some stuff
81:10 - oh you can set an led based on the month
81:14 - and the day to true or false
81:16 - oh well if there's like an api for doing
81:18 - this i might actually be
81:19 - able to succeed here let's see if this
81:21 - works so then i need to
81:22 - open the serial monitor is that a thing
81:25 - tools
81:26 - because that's going to show me like
81:28 - board at null is not available
81:31 - that's not a good sign how do i know if
81:32 - the board is actually
81:34 - being detected
81:40 - that's a bad sign it's plugged in right
81:44 - this is plugged in this is plugged in
81:48 - oh boy this is going to be really sad
81:52 - what happens if i just do this verify
81:56 - okay so that verified the code but this
82:00 - is like the upload
82:02 - serial port oh no wonder i gotta select
82:05 - the serial port there we go
82:08 - so there we go
82:11 - did it just do a test pattern
82:17 - i sort of thought maybe it did something
82:19 - wait
82:20 - no that's just like a shadow whenever i
82:23 - turn my head
82:25 - all right hold on let's go to the serial
82:27 - monitor
82:29 - there we go oh error
82:36 - uh okay hold on wait what am i
82:41 - what's going on here i don't understand
82:44 - how any of this stuff works but let's do
82:46 - this
82:49 - oh something's happening
82:54 - it's doing stuff yes
83:03 - that was cool all the lights are on
83:08 - except for the 30th interesting how the
83:11 - 30th is all off do i have a defective
83:13 - one or is that a mistake in the code
83:15 - [Music]
83:16 - um let's how do i do it again
83:25 - i don't want this serial output is like
83:27 - feels like
83:29 - i don't necessarily need to see it
83:35 - this feels much more important to me so
83:37 - if i were to run it again
83:40 - i it's uploading it uploading it's just
83:44 - running is it let's try it again all
83:46 - right i'm uploading the code
83:59 - it's a feature says dave
84:02 - how long does it take for it to get
84:05 - there
84:09 - there's a lot of waiting involved with
84:12 - this arduino programming
84:17 - upload i know that upload sends it to
84:19 - the board so conceivably
84:21 - there would be a way
84:25 - right i can see sketch started and it
84:28 - said sketch setup started program touch
84:30 - controllers
84:31 - now it's doing some stuff and then it's
84:34 - turning on all the lights
84:35 - except for 30 and awesome okay so let's
84:39 - try
84:40 - let's just try one more um test
84:47 - we're gonna try
84:50 - um
84:54 - you know actually i'm gonna program the
84:55 - game of life on this let's start with
84:57 - that that's what i should really do
84:58 - programming test what's that
85:01 - rear test there's a rear
85:06 - so what does this do
85:10 - oh this is just kind of like a
85:14 - basic beginner let's
85:17 - let's go to um
85:22 - there's programming tests uh
85:25 - front test let's try this one
85:30 - let's see what this does this must be
85:32 - the
85:35 - actual i was assuming this was the
85:37 - software let's fade them
85:39 - honey drip start up animation
85:43 - whoa this is wild okay let's verify this
85:47 - okay let's upload it
85:57 - there's a reset button on the board okay
86:00 - oh there we go
86:01 - awesome and then fades out
86:05 - awesome all right oh awesome this is
86:07 - great this should this i can work with
86:14 - why do i see what's this error message
86:17 - like why
86:18 - is this error message showing up just
86:19 - over and over again after it finishes
86:21 - doing what it did
86:23 - i wonder all right
86:29 - all right everybody this was a good
86:31 - first half of this live stream
86:35 - i'm gonna do something that i have never
86:37 - done before or maybe i've done it once
86:40 - um i have two sponsors to thank uh
86:44 - for today's uh coding train um episode
86:48 - um and let me get myself set up to do
86:51 - that it's going to give me i'm going to
86:52 - take about a few minutes to do that then
86:54 - i'm going to take about a five minute
86:55 - break and i'm going to come back to with
86:57 - the calendar
86:57 - so let me start
87:02 - with
87:04 - and if you'll give me a second here
87:15 - i muted myself for a second to shout
87:16 - downstairs okay
87:18 - so um first i want to tell you about
87:20 - notion um
87:22 - notion is a productivity software
87:24 - software that breaks the mold by
87:26 - combining all essential work tools notes
87:28 - docs databases tasks and more
87:30 - in one place so you get more done now i
87:32 - actually started using notion recently
87:34 - um it's it's kind of actually amazing as
87:36 - even just a publishing platform
87:38 - but most notably and hopefully late in
87:40 - the future i'll get to sort of play
87:42 - around with the apis you can create
87:43 - databases in it
87:44 - and so um let me just show you some of
87:46 - the notion stuff this is what the notion
87:48 - desktop software looks like
87:50 - but what i've been using it for is
87:52 - keeping track of a database of everybody
87:54 - who joins the coding train
87:55 - so you see sort of like i have
87:57 - everybody's name
87:58 - what level they are whether they've
88:00 - received their stickers or not
88:02 - and various things like that so it's
88:04 - finally getting me to keep organized
88:05 - it's a great way to collaborate you can
88:07 - have a team
88:09 - um personal plans used to be five
88:11 - dollars a month but now you can get a
88:12 - personal plan for free forever and free
88:15 - users will be able to add as many blocks
88:17 - as they like to their personal notion
88:18 - database
88:19 - one of the things that's kind of amazing
88:20 - about notion that i've also recently
88:21 - discovered
88:22 - is that tens of thousands of students
88:24 - are using it for class notes managing
88:25 - tasks
88:26 - organizing job applications you know i'm
88:28 - a teacher and so it's sort of
88:30 - interesting always for me to follow what
88:31 - kind of tools are helpful for teaching
88:33 - and for studying and for note-taking
88:35 - you can find out more at notion.so
88:38 - students
88:39 - it's also great for the office it's been
88:41 - used by the wall street journal verizon
88:42 - and even pixar
88:44 - wow you can create a company wiki answer
88:46 - questions at scale on board new
88:48 - employees track every project catalog
88:50 - there's a lot of templates in there that
88:52 - are designed specifically for students
88:53 - and educators so this is probably most
88:54 - of the audience that you might be
88:55 - interested in and you can all be added
88:57 - to your workspace with one click
88:59 - when you hit duplicate at the top right
89:01 - corner
89:02 - i also want to quickly show you um what
89:05 - it looks like on mobile i end up
89:07 - checking on mobile a lot like
89:08 - well i don't ride the subway too much
89:10 - anymore because we're in a global
89:11 - pandemic
89:12 - but when i was riding the subway i would
89:14 - always be like checking like well what's
89:15 - the latest thing what do i need to do
89:17 - helps keep me organized as i kind of
89:18 - commute to and from um
89:20 - different places so it's really got a
89:21 - nice um elegant app
89:23 - so again i uh would encourage you to
89:26 - check it out
89:27 - um you can go right to bitly notion
89:30 - coding train if you sign up there let's
89:31 - let me know you know that you found the
89:33 - coding train helps me out a little bit
89:35 - thank you very much it's definitely
89:36 - appreciated um
89:39 - and i'd love to hear what you think of
89:40 - it so that is notion
89:42 - thank you so much to notion for
89:44 - sponsoring the coding train it really
89:45 - makes all this
89:46 - like weird nonsense stuff that i do
89:48 - possible
89:49 - i also today's live stream is also
89:52 - sponsored by
89:54 - brilliant so brilliant um as you've
89:56 - probably noticed before on the channel
89:58 - i've referred to on many an occasion
90:01 - i've kind of like looked up stuff in
90:03 - there i've tried their puzzles
90:04 - i've done coding challenges that have
90:05 - some same content um
90:07 - so many things that i've done with
90:09 - brilliant it's like it's really nice
90:10 - like if you want to learn something new
90:12 - um brilliant is the place to do it it's
90:14 - a website and an app
90:15 - it makes learning accessible and fun
90:17 - it's all problem-solving it's all
90:18 - interactive
90:19 - so rather than this thing that i do
90:21 - which is these kind of like sequence
90:22 - tutorials
90:23 - where i'm talking at you and showing
90:24 - things this is a thing that you can
90:25 - really kind of do at your own pace
90:27 - and interact with um one of my favorite
90:29 - they have a whole lot of like daily
90:30 - puzzles and challenges but they also
90:31 - have all these courses
90:33 - and so my one of my favorite courses on
90:34 - there is the one on neural networks
90:36 - um i always look at this and review it
90:38 - before i teach neural networks in my
90:40 - class
90:41 - uh just kind of go through and kind of
90:43 - look at and just some of the ways that
90:44 - the interactivity and the visualizations
90:46 - has been
90:47 - designed are really just um
90:51 - super effective and and clear so the
90:54 - other thing that i should mention is
90:55 - that they have a brand new
90:57 - course um on infiniti and i started this
91:00 - course last week on the live stream
91:02 - um so reckoning with infinity is one of
91:04 - the major accomplishments of mathematics
91:06 - it's like you know basic counting if you
91:08 - try to count a lot you'll
91:10 - not get to infinity but you'll be
91:12 - working your way up to there and there's
91:13 - many types of infinity and
91:14 - the profundity of cantorus theorem is a
91:16 - thing that you can kind of discover
91:18 - the stunning beauty of fractals
91:21 - tessellations in hyperbolic space if
91:23 - you're interested in any of these kinds
91:24 - of things
91:25 - this course um goes through and covers
91:28 - quite
91:28 - a bit of it so i really would encourage
91:31 - you and again i i always have so much
91:32 - fun one of my favorite things
91:34 - and simon pointed that out to me is that
91:36 - show explanation button
91:38 - um i really love to try to figure
91:40 - something out with
91:41 - and brilliant i often get it wrong and
91:43 - then i can click the show explanation
91:44 - and there's
91:45 - you know usually something sort of
91:46 - official by maybe somebody on the
91:47 - brilliant staff but also just
91:49 - a ton of uh community contributions to
91:52 - um
91:52 - different things there as well so i hope
91:54 - you consider
91:56 - um checking out brilliant um you can
91:58 - sign up for free
92:00 - at if i can get this right um what
92:03 - no all these buttons
92:07 - uh come on buttons no here button there
92:09 - we go you can sign up for free
92:11 - at brilliant.org codingtrain um
92:14 - and then you'll be access to a lot of
92:16 - the features in the daily puzzles
92:18 - but if you want to unlock everything
92:20 - that brilliant has to offer all of its
92:21 - courses
92:22 - um you can sign up for a premium
92:24 - subscription if you go through this link
92:25 - you will get um
92:26 - 20 offer at least the first 200 people
92:28 - who do through that link will get 20
92:30 - off i also think it's a really nice gift
92:32 - not the holiday season just yet
92:34 - but it's something that i've been
92:35 - considering is giving people like a year
92:36 - membership to brilliant
92:37 - as a gift which i think um you know
92:40 - we all have too much stuff and we all
92:43 - use screens too much and this is like
92:45 - something in the middle it's a it's a
92:47 - using screens in an educational way
92:48 - and it's not like stuff that you have to
92:50 - then throw away later so
92:52 - um i hope you check that out notion and
92:54 - brilliant thank you mwah for sponsoring
92:56 - the coding train
92:57 - a train whistle for both of you um if
93:00 - you want to check those out i'm going to
93:01 - take a five minute break you can go sign
93:03 - up at those links
93:04 - and i'll be back trying to write this
93:06 - actual arduino code
93:08 - for the everyday calendar in about five
93:10 - minutes
93:13 - oh no oh no we've got a problem houston
93:16 - we have a problem can you still hear me
93:24 - um here's the problem uh this
93:28 - ipad which i usually um play my music on
93:34 - the battery died you do have a usb cable
93:36 - uh charger
93:39 - question is and i like to play oh you
93:42 - know what i can do
93:43 - i got an idea so let's let me unplug it
93:45 - from this
93:46 - oh oh that might have given you some
93:48 - awful sound in your ear
93:50 - apologies in advance let me plug this in
93:53 - to charge it
93:54 - i really am a mess today total mess but
93:57 - if we can
93:58 - if we can get game of life running on
93:59 - this i'm gonna be just so happy
94:01 - the tricky thing will be like how do i
94:03 - know what's who's neighbor it's not like
94:05 - a
94:06 - obvious pixel grid i guess i can think
94:08 - of
94:09 - the months as the rows the columns sorry
94:12 - in the days that's the column so
94:14 - actually this might not be as hard as i
94:15 - think
94:16 - um so what was i doing i'm
94:20 - charging up the music and then what i
94:22 - can do
94:23 - is i can just play the music directly
94:26 - from
94:28 - uh coding train uh
94:31 - soundcloud
94:35 - there it is so this is random this is
94:37 - noise
94:38 - noise that is in the core random
94:40 - algorithm the
94:41 - actual random algorithm itself those
94:44 - numbers aren't
94:45 - related at all i'm thinking numbers
94:50 - seven six one nine four
94:53 - eight nine two one three let's take
94:55 - another lot of problems few minute break
94:57 - with curling noise i might pick numbers
94:58 - like this two
95:00 - three four three four five six five
95:03 - four five six seven five six seven
95:06 - five six seven eight nine eight seven
95:09 - six
95:10 - well this is like pearl and noise
95:11 - performance art
95:16 - [Music]
95:26 - performance
95:28 - [Music]
95:41 - seven five six seven five purling noise
95:44 - that is
95:44 - pearly noise so this is hurling noise
95:45 - that is pearly noise this is this is
95:47 - hurling noise that is pearly noise so
95:48 - this is hurling noise that is
95:50 - pearly noise that is pearly noise so
95:52 - this is hurling noise that is pearl this
95:54 - is this is
96:15 - i might pick numbers like this two three
96:18 - four
96:18 - three four five six five four five
96:21 - six seven five
96:36 - as always i always forget that this stop
96:38 - this stop this stop this stop
96:39 - i'm gonna do this stock this stock i'm
96:41 - gonna do this this stock this stop this
96:43 - stop i'm gonna do
96:44 - this stop this stop this dot this dot
97:18 - this
97:26 - [Music]
97:40 - never forget this dot somebody composed
97:43 - that song for me
97:45 - firework is not defined in line six uh
97:48 - yep as always i always forget that this
97:49 - stock this stock this stuff
97:51 - i'm going to do this this dot this dot
97:53 - this this dot song never forget to this
97:55 - dot
97:56 - somebody composed that song for me uh
98:00 - okay
98:14 - is
98:31 - all right i'm back sorry about the um
98:34 - loud uh noises there
98:38 - uh the loud sound
98:42 - um i didn't want to take too long of a
98:44 - break because i really want to get going
98:46 - with this
98:47 - and see if i can manage to is this
98:51 - live oh it's still now now it's actually
98:52 - working okay if i can get this
98:55 - to really do what i want it to do all
98:58 - right so
98:58 - i assume that some of you out there much
99:01 - more experience
99:03 - with the arduino that i did than i do um
99:06 - and but i'm just gonna do my best i'm
99:09 - gonna try to i think what i'll first do
99:11 - let me just see if i can individually
99:13 - address
99:15 - every single one of the dates and turn
99:17 - it on and off on my own
99:19 - um so
99:23 - that way i'll like understand if i can
99:26 - really work with this
99:27 - so it looks like i'm importing i'm
99:30 - guessing this is c code where i'm
99:32 - importing importing these libraries
99:35 - um oh you're not seeing that so let me
99:37 - go back to here
99:38 - so um looks like and i think i can i
99:41 - guess i'm just
99:42 - i'm just working in arduino now so let
99:45 - me move this over
99:47 - um and why why why this is camera no no
99:50 - no this way
99:51 - i want you to see it perfectly there we
99:54 - go
99:55 - all right i'm going to now do save as
99:59 - and i'm going to save this as test
100:02 - pattern
100:04 - everyday calendar
100:07 - so looks like
100:10 - oh first what i do to talk to it is set
100:13 - up
100:13 - serial begin 9600 this
100:17 - runs some initialize led functionality
100:20 - begin
100:22 - let's keep the startup animation that's
100:23 - useful to see
100:26 - and this is fading them out i guess this
100:28 - does
100:29 - all the lights so a way to address
100:32 - all the lights is through set brightness
100:36 - so but i'm going to take that out right
100:37 - now i don't want to do that
100:39 - i'm not going to worry about the touch
100:42 - functionality because
100:46 - i think i can work with that later
100:51 - this is fading them in and that's
100:55 - uh yeah so now what i want to do
100:58 - boy this is like
101:02 - caltouch x boy is there maybe there's
101:05 - some
101:06 - documentation that i can read here in
101:08 - the library
101:10 - uh or am i just meant to figure this out
101:16 - um okay so let's actually let me just do
101:19 - something
101:19 - i don't want to worry about the button
101:21 - stuff now so
101:23 - i'm going to get rid of all that forget
101:25 - about the button stuff
101:31 - let's forget all about that for a second
101:33 - uh this look
101:34 - cal light set led month
101:37 - adjusted day
101:40 - month day offset what the what is that
101:44 - is this like how many extra days there
101:46 - are in each month
101:47 - or how many fewer days fewer days in
101:49 - february oh that's kind of cool
101:51 - okay so this is doing them one at a time
101:54 - turning all the leds on so i do month
101:59 - day and true just turns it on
102:03 - so if i were to do something like you
102:06 - know what i want to just make my own
102:08 - startup animation is the point here
102:11 - so let me think about how i would do
102:12 - this
102:14 - um let me just try i just want to turn
102:18 - on one
102:19 - forget about the startup animation
102:25 - um and what happens if i just run this
102:27 - right now does this actually turn them
102:29 - on
102:29 - let's see
102:35 - like if i initialize the functionality i
102:37 - guess i need the serial monitor open to
102:40 - see what's being printed out
102:43 - sketch started sketch setup complete
102:46 - how can i get it so that you can see
102:48 - this effectively i think i'll just put
102:50 - this over here
102:51 - that's fine you can kind of see that oh
102:53 - that's not good can i do this
102:56 - this is kind of the best i can do right
102:58 - now so now
103:00 - let me just see can i do cal
103:03 - lights
103:07 - set led
103:11 - um month adjusted day
103:15 - true so if i said set led
103:20 - month i'm going to do gen is month j is
103:23 - zero or one
103:25 - zero so i wanna do i'm gonna do i'm
103:28 - gonna do my birthday
103:29 - which would be july
103:33 - which would be july 29th so july is
103:36 - seven but i assume it's six because
103:38 - january is zero true
103:42 - so if i run this
103:45 - then like serial
103:49 - print line happy birthday let me just
103:52 - make sure it's actually going
103:54 - the light go on oh yeah no oh july 30
103:57 - it's
103:58 - june is that june july 30th is on can
104:01 - you see that
104:02 - it's on but it's so it's the 28th
104:06 - so let's try that again
104:11 - this is i don't think it's going to be
104:12 - nearly as hard as i thought it was going
104:14 - to be
104:15 - there we go it's on beautiful
104:20 - okay i know how to turn one on now if i
104:23 - do like
104:24 - delay a thousand that would be one
104:27 - second
104:29 - and then if i do false
104:33 - that's going to turn it off
104:38 - so it should be on just for one second
104:39 - we're watching
104:42 - [Music]
104:45 - did you see that let me show you that
104:47 - again that was so exciting
104:50 - the 29 is going to go on and it's going
104:52 - to go off
104:54 - i can do anything i want there's nothing
104:56 - i can't program here i could make a
104:58 - server
104:59 - that talks serially to the arduino i put
105:01 - the arduino on the internet
105:02 - and like i have people type things into
105:04 - the chat there's so much i could do i
105:05 - have a twitter bot
105:06 - oh my goodness discord chat bot so many
105:08 - possibilities all right let's start
105:10 - small
105:14 - so to do the camera interaction i would
105:17 - need a processing sketch and have
105:18 - processing talk serially to the arduino
105:21 - so i think that's uh let me that that i
105:24 - got to save for later i don't know if
105:25 - i'll be able to do that of today
105:27 - um the game of life is definitely
105:31 - possible is there a simpler well first
105:32 - actually what i want to check
105:34 - is can i set the brightness of an
105:37 - individual led where do i find
105:41 - the like api docs for this
105:44 - do they exist i mean i'm fine with just
105:46 - turning them on and off
105:47 - but i would love to know
105:51 - if um i suppose i could just look
105:54 - here like this is what i'm looking at
105:57 - lights
105:59 - like if i look in the dot h file with is
106:01 - that kind of like self documenting in a
106:03 - way
106:04 - set led toggle led set brightness
106:09 - so i don't think doesn't look like i can
106:11 - set
106:13 - oh toggle is great it doesn't look like
106:17 - i can set all
106:23 - an individual brightness i can only set
106:26 - the brightness of all of them
106:29 - like so for example
106:32 - this set brightness is 200 the highest
106:37 - 200. i assume that's the highest can i
106:40 - make it higher
106:42 - let's turn it to 11 1100 what's gonna
106:46 - happen
106:52 - dvd logo bouncing that's pretty great
106:54 - let's do a bouncing ball
106:57 - let's just think of it as a pixel grid
106:59 - yeah let's do bouncing
107:01 - just so i understand let's do so that
107:05 - um well i can't tell if that's it i'm
107:09 - assuming 200 is the brightest
107:12 - so i think i can only set the brightness
107:15 - globally but i can turn them on and off
107:17 - and we have this point i don't
107:20 - understand how do i make can i make
107:22 - a so then or do i this do i do this
107:27 - how do i do i don't know how to program
107:29 - on the arduino in c
107:31 - uh uh do i do that
107:35 - it has an x and a y how do i make how do
107:38 - i use structures in c
107:40 - oh this is so embarrassing it's not
107:42 - embarrassing
107:43 - structure in c
107:48 - structure structure structure yeah so
107:51 - show me how to make one
107:52 - struct books book
107:56 - and then i copied something into it
107:58 - that's weird
107:59 - int book book id okay great i see so it
108:03 - looks like i can just use it almost like
108:04 - an object
108:06 - so i can say do i do it where
108:09 - can i make that struct point
108:15 - [Music]
108:16 - um
108:18 - oh i'm not showing my screen thank you
108:20 - everybody ah
108:22 - i should just i'm gonna leave it here
108:24 - apologies i'm gonna leave it here
108:26 - i'm so sorry so sorry
108:29 - um all right struct point
108:32 - uh ball
108:36 - ball dot x equals zero ball
108:39 - and then hold on then it's i'm gonna say
108:42 - ball dot x equals zero ball dot y equals
108:45 - 0
108:47 - and in loop
108:53 - i'm going to i think i also need
109:00 - i'm going to need the previous location
109:06 - i mean it would make sense ultimately
109:08 - for me to just make a generic
109:11 - arduino sketch that p5 can just send it
109:15 - an x a y and a
109:19 - um an estate
109:22 - and then um
109:25 - because i can do so much more coding in
109:27 - p5 in terms of algorithms but this is
109:29 - good let me explore
109:30 - learning how to write some of these
109:30 - algorithms just in arduino
109:33 - and then actually like it doesn't have
109:34 - to be tethered the game of life is going
109:36 - to be awesome
109:37 - i think on it so but let's do the
109:39 - bouncing ball first just as
109:40 - practice so now what i want to do is i
109:43 - want to take
109:45 - this and
109:49 - i want to let's take this out
109:54 - so we're going to do
109:56 - [Music]
109:58 - in loop we're going to always set
110:03 - previous x previous
110:06 - y to false
110:11 - and then
110:15 - ball x and ball y
110:19 - to true and then can i just say
110:23 - ball previous equals ball or that's
110:25 - going to load it's going to be like
110:26 - pointer issues
110:28 - so i think i just need to say previous x
110:30 - equals ball x
110:31 - previous y equals ball y and i'm just
110:34 - going to do right now
110:36 - ball dot x plus plus
110:39 - so this should be like a little
110:40 - animation of the
110:42 - of just going across the top like it
110:45 - should start at the top
110:46 - left and should go across to the right
110:48 - and eventually
110:50 - die okay point after struct
110:53 - that's not how you do it
110:56 - [Music]
110:57 - so i have to sneeze
111:01 - so what did i do wrong here about how i
111:04 - um how i declared my struct
111:08 - can i just do this
111:14 - yeah i guess i just do that
111:20 - is it it's going like super fast
111:25 - because i didn't put a delay in like
111:27 - loop
111:29 - like if i wanted to be like a 30 frames
111:31 - per second animation
111:33 - then like uh 30 frames per second
111:37 - um would be um what's the delay
111:41 - uh between frames we want to get in one
111:44 - second we want 30 of them so like
111:47 - do a delay of like 33 milliseconds
111:56 - is that what i want it's still gonna be
111:58 - super fast
112:02 - yeah it went across did you see it okay
112:05 - so now i need
112:08 - a
112:14 - speed
112:16 - oh why is speed highlighting
112:19 - um that seems weird let's just use like
112:21 - velocity
112:23 - and we'll say velocity.x equals one
112:26 - velocity.y equals one i should make
112:30 - these floats
112:32 - how do can i just do this this float a
112:36 - thing
112:37 - um and then i can actually have like
112:40 - smaller numbers
112:42 - and then i can say
112:49 - i'm like remaking the nature of code
112:51 - here
112:53 - um and then what i i can convert these
112:56 - to like an integer right
113:04 - so that should work let's see what
113:07 - happens here
113:11 - let's see what i get
113:18 - did you see that it went sort of like
113:20 - jiggling down so now
113:22 - if um
113:27 - if ball dot x is greater than equal to
113:31 - 12
113:35 - or ball dot y
113:39 - ball dot y is less than or equal to zero
113:43 - no sorry ball dot x then velocity dot x
113:47 - times equals negative one
113:52 - and then y
113:55 - let's just let's just say 30
114:00 - and have that so i'm gonna bounce it off
114:02 - the edges
114:03 - and let's see if this works okay no
114:06 - match for
114:06 - oh you can't that's not or
114:10 - how do i do or in c
114:14 - or in c operators
114:19 - or logical logical
114:23 - or yeah
114:26 - what did i do do i need like the
114:30 - parentheses around everything
114:36 - it like just want more parentheses
114:39 - yeah i guess that's it
114:43 - i think it just it's not as flexible as
114:47 - javascript let's try this
114:55 - i don't think it bounced wait hold on
114:58 - expected oh whoops
115:04 - see if it starts bouncing
115:14 - [Laughter]
115:17 - it's kind of fun
115:20 - so it doesn't really care if i try
115:23 - to give it spots that don't exist so i
115:26 - could do the game of life and just
115:27 - consider this a total square
115:34 - uh yeah but yes i see that i've already
115:38 - i'm
115:38 - uh the problem is the chat's like 30
115:40 - seconds behind me but thank you for
115:41 - correcting me
115:43 - i don't know what if this light is
115:45 - making it
115:46 - should be darker here for you to see it
115:48 - i guess this light is fine on me
115:52 - um cool okay now
115:55 - let's just go full on game of life
116:00 - okay uh this is dedicated to the
116:04 - mathematician john conway who famously
116:06 - hated the game of life but who created
116:10 - the game of life
116:11 - let's just um let's just get that to
116:13 - work so i think what i'm going to do
116:16 - is just grab my processing code for so
116:19 - let me do save as um and i'm going to
116:22 - call this
116:23 - game of life oh my god i have a
116:28 - brilliant idea
116:30 - i can add the touch stuff so you can
116:33 - like put on a pattern
116:35 - and have it go up there's a cat
116:39 - there might be a cat appearing soon in
116:41 - this live stream
116:43 - okay um all right so
116:47 - let's now
116:50 - so let me look for my game of life
116:53 - coding challenge
116:57 - um let's go to here and let's look at
117:01 - the
117:02 - you know i should look at the processing
117:03 - code because the processing code is
117:06 - going to be closer
117:08 - um to what i'm doing here
117:13 - so what good news is i don't need to
117:16 - worry about this resolution thing
117:18 - so this is stuff that i need
117:25 - so if you don't know what the game of
117:26 - life is i probably should take a minute
117:28 - to explain it
117:29 - uh for those of you who are watching let
117:30 - me go to this version
117:33 - this is a p5.js sketch running this
117:35 - particular pattern it's known as a
117:36 - cellular automata
117:38 - which i always say wrong and everybody's
117:40 - told me a million times
117:43 - come here well the cat ran away um
117:47 - and um what it is is it's a system
117:50 - where of a it's a grid much like the
117:52 - calendar is a grid and every cell of the
117:54 - grid
117:55 - is on or off in this case the on or off
117:58 - or alive or dead
117:59 - is visualized with a white square versus
118:02 - a black square
118:03 - and whether it's on or off uh is
118:06 - determined
118:08 - by the configuration of its neighbors
118:11 - in a previous moment in time so the idea
118:14 - is cells that are surrounded by life
118:18 - come to life cells that are not
118:20 - surrounded by life
118:21 - die out but if there's too much life
118:24 - around it
118:25 - it's overpopulated and it also dies out
118:27 - so basically
118:28 - you're looking for cells that have two
118:31 - you know two or three
118:32 - there's exact rules for it and i have
118:34 - those in the code
118:35 - all right they're not um so basically if
118:38 - i
118:38 - we can see them right here if i am
118:41 - a cell that state is zero i'm dead
118:45 - and i have exactly three neighbors alive
118:47 - then i turn on
118:48 - if i am alive or my state is one and i
118:51 - have
118:52 - less than two too few neighbors or more
118:55 - than three
118:55 - too many i turn myself off otherwise i
118:58 - stay
118:59 - with what i was before so in many ways
119:01 - this code should translate
119:03 - right over to arduino so let's go back
119:07 - to here and i just don't know how to do
119:10 - like two-dimensional arrays and all that
119:12 - stuff in c
119:12 - but let's see if i can get it going
119:17 - now this is interesting to me am i
119:18 - supposed to when working with arduino
119:21 - really specify the kind of integer i
119:23 - want to use like into 16 is not like a
119:25 - 16-bit integer or something
119:27 - it's not something that i usually think
119:28 - of let's get rid of the
119:32 - this stuff and let's see like 2d array
119:35 - in
119:35 - c
119:41 - 2d oh so this is easy not easy but i'm
119:44 - going to say
119:45 - int grid
119:50 - and the grid has 12 across
119:54 - and 31 and i'm just going to do the
119:56 - calculations
119:57 - as if there were spots
120:01 - for all months went to 31 and they just
120:03 - won't light up i assume
120:05 - um but i think that'll work the cat is
120:08 - no i the cat is like got a string and i
120:12 - really don't think the cat should eat
120:13 - that string oops
120:14 - sorry because if the cat eats that
120:16 - string
120:17 - then i might have to i could be very
120:20 - dangerous no no
120:21 - kitty don't eat the string okay
120:26 - oh there's another usb um
120:30 - hub okay sorry about that we've got to
120:33 - save the life of a cat
120:35 - it's very important arthur is saying i
120:38 - prefer to use pointers all right well
120:41 - i'll come back to that all right so now
120:45 - um so in the number of columns
120:49 - i mean
120:54 - can i do this
120:57 - i don't know um all right
121:01 - so now i need to if i go back to my
121:04 - processing code
121:08 - what i want to do is initialize them
121:11 - randomly
121:12 - to on or off
121:17 - so uh let's get rid of all this stuff
121:25 - now a lot of the api in arduino is the
121:29 - same as in processing
121:30 - so i'm kind of hoping this is just going
121:32 - to work and then i should be able to say
121:35 - and i shouldn't have deleted that
121:37 - because i want this
121:43 - [Music]
121:45 - whoops what did i just do ah
121:48 - where's my code that's right let me just
121:50 - keep this
121:52 - let me grab this
121:56 - and why not just try doing this
122:05 - [Music]
122:08 - these should be oh these should actually
122:10 - be boolean
122:11 - can i just do that i'll leave them as
122:13 - integers because then i could just set
122:15 - it to its state here
122:21 - well i'm gonna be ridiculous everyone's
122:24 - gonna hate me for this
122:32 - but i'm a little stubborn i'm gonna do
122:34 - it this way
122:37 - don't eat that string evie
122:42 - you're the most beautiful this is the
122:43 - most beautiful cat she's a calico cat
122:45 - she never comes out
122:47 - i don't think i've ever had her on a
122:48 - stream
122:50 - but now she's leaving the attic um
122:54 - let's see what this does
122:57 - array bound is not an integer constant
123:00 - so these have to be constants
123:01 - like that constant in maybe
123:04 - will that work ball was not declared oh
123:08 - i don't need any of this stuff now
123:12 - and i don't even need this let's try
123:14 - this
123:18 - so i should see just randomly that i've
123:19 - got a 50 chance of being on or off
123:23 - there we go perfect okay so that's my
123:26 - initial game of life
123:27 - state this isn't going to take very long
123:30 - awesome
123:31 - now let's go back and i've got the
123:33 - algorithm worked out here
123:35 - so basically oh and i need to have
123:40 - next all right so i need to swap
123:43 - so i also need to have next
123:46 - columns rows
123:49 - and in draw let's just grab the
123:55 - full processing code i apologize for
123:58 - well i don't apologize i think this is
124:00 - the way to do it
124:00 - you can watch the coding challenge if
124:02 - you want to see me code this all the way
124:03 - through
124:04 - so basically um
124:07 - i don't need this i'm going through all
124:10 - the columns i'm checking the state
124:12 - i need this count neighbors function
124:15 - which is just counting
124:17 - all the neighbors whether they're on or
124:19 - off
124:20 - i don't need this honey drip
124:25 - um
124:28 - oh this is this is this is different i
124:30 - need to do this
124:32 - i should probably be using pointers
124:36 - because then i can swap i'm not doing
124:38 - this right but let me just
124:41 - let me just try to get it to work and
124:42 - then i'll think about this
124:44 - can i do it like this oh
124:47 - this is weird uh grid
124:52 - equals net um
124:56 - temp equals grid can i do this grid
124:59 - equals next next
125:00 - equals grid this is like a swapping
125:04 - algorithm i need to swap them
125:06 - because i need to have the previous
125:07 - state and the earlier state and i want
125:08 - them
125:09 - to just swap those back and forth i have
125:12 - no idea if this is going to work
125:14 - and then i need the count neighbors
125:16 - function
125:18 - which i feel like
125:22 - i guess i would do this again this seems
125:24 - weird
125:27 - um it's got to be something seriously
125:30 - wrong here
125:32 - um
125:36 - yeah i should probably do this with
125:39 - pointers but let's
125:40 - see if this works i mean what error am i
125:42 - going to get all right
125:44 - invalid array assignment
125:52 - i mean another thing i could do is i
125:53 - could do what i was doing
125:57 - is just create a new one every time
126:03 - oh no no no no oh because this is
126:05 - written
126:10 - well let's try doing
126:16 - [Music]
126:18 - whoa what is going on how did i do this
126:21 - in processing i did this in such a weird
126:23 - way
126:26 - i draw all the grid that i make next i
126:29 - compute
126:30 - it based off of the grid got it and then
126:33 - i say grid equals next all right let's
126:34 - try that
126:35 - this is absurd but let's see if it'll
126:38 - let me do i mean this is like terrible
126:39 - memory management and on the arduino
126:41 - this actually matters
126:43 - like what if i were to just make
126:47 - a new array
126:51 - called next every time in loop which is
126:54 - a terrible idea
126:56 - and then i would
127:00 - say i would initialize
127:03 - all those values and then grid would
127:06 - just become
127:07 - next or should i copy it over
127:15 - next equals temp not next equals grid
127:18 - oh right of course
127:22 - so that but but let me try this weird
127:23 - silly way first
127:25 - no you can't just assign one of these to
127:28 - another
127:30 - you could copy i think i need to use
127:31 - pointers oh if i need a lesson in
127:34 - pointers
127:36 - mem copy int next okay
127:41 - right i got an idea
127:50 - i got an idea what if i do
128:00 - this and then i just say
128:06 - initialize them all to zero which i'm
128:08 - not sure is necessary
128:10 - then uh i take the grid and i do this
128:15 - and then i do this like i make this a
128:18 - pointer
128:20 - temp
128:22 - temp it points
128:26 - to grid
128:31 - next is going to be temp
128:35 - and then can i not do this
128:38 - grid becomes next this is what i feel
128:40 - like i want to do
128:43 - cannot convert int 31
128:46 - to n should just be one star i don't
128:49 - know how to do pointers i've done this
128:50 - in so long
128:55 - int and reference okay people are
128:58 - telling me
129:00 - ptrh this is getting boring it's not
129:02 - like the old days it was bor it wasn't
129:04 - boring
129:10 - i have to copy
129:13 - uh try using a for loop to copy each
129:16 - yeah
129:18 - yeah that's what i think i would do
129:21 - not common in c because c is not a
129:23 - language made for it c doesn't have a
129:25 - deep copy
129:25 - all right i'm going to do it
129:28 - a very silly way because it's very
129:32 - little data and i'm just going to make
129:34 - three of them
129:40 - and i pre so i probably should just make
129:42 - it a single array and then
129:44 - compute the index but let's just
129:47 - initialize them all like this
129:50 - okay and then we're going to do this
129:53 - where we calculate what
129:54 - next is based on it and then
129:58 - i'm going to write a function copy
130:01 - next into temp
130:08 - grid
130:11 - uh hold on
130:17 - so what was i doing before if next is
130:20 - what i want
130:23 - next is the next state so i need to copy
130:26 - grid into temp
130:30 - and then
130:34 - actually i don't care i don't need to
130:36 - swap
130:37 - because i'm going to calculate it every
130:39 - value
130:40 - so i can just say copy
130:45 - next into grid that's it i don't even
130:48 - need temp
130:49 - why do i need temp
130:54 - i don't need temp am i wrong about that
130:57 - let's get rid of temp
131:01 - and then let's write a function called
131:05 - uh i'm going to just call it copy array
131:11 - copy array well what do i put as the
131:14 - arguments
131:17 - well i guess i'll just do it manually
131:19 - here so i don't have to make it into a
131:22 - function
131:27 - this is so silly right all i need to do
131:30 - now is say
131:32 - next i j a grid i j
131:36 - equals next i j
131:39 - [Music]
131:41 - and then it's and up here
131:49 - i just need to get rid of this
131:53 - and set all the lights based on
131:59 - based on whether it's on or off
132:04 - this should work let's see what happens
132:08 - low memory available stabilizability
132:10 - problems may occur
132:12 - global variables use 98 of dynamic
132:18 - memory
132:24 - i can use mem copy next grid rows dot
132:27 - columns
132:27 - that makes sense uh
132:35 - have i killed the arduino
132:41 - let's try this
132:52 - is it getting to here
132:59 - i'm a little concerned about this low
133:01 - memory
133:08 - static what does that do
133:16 - all right so i you know one d or i
133:17 - shouldn't use a 2d array
133:19 - this is very silly what i'm doing
133:25 - yeah i agree with violet
133:28 - um why am i not getting anything
133:33 - i don't see an error ooh
133:38 - i don't think i'm getting to
133:43 - i guess it's just not working all right
133:47 - oh okay well one thing is this is
133:49 - ridiculous i'm using like a huge
133:51 - integer to store a zero or one so i
133:54 - should go back to using a boolean
133:56 - right
133:57 - [Music]
134:01 - that's definitely one thing i should do
134:03 - and then also
134:07 - um
134:11 - so let's do a couple things one is let's
134:13 - make these one-dimensional arrays
134:16 - is that how you make a one-dimensional
134:18 - array in c
134:21 - and let's get rid of this let's not
134:22 - worry about loop right now
134:25 - let's take this let's let's i guess i
134:27 - have to think about memory on an arduino
134:30 - which i never have to do okay so now i'm
134:33 - making a one-dimensional array
134:36 - i'm going to pick a random
134:40 - number
134:46 - there's got to be a correct way of doing
134:48 - this but um
134:55 - um equals true
135:15 - uh so let's do it this way
135:22 - so let's see if this works
135:26 - um
135:33 - all right let's see if this works this
135:35 - is going to make much more sense
135:38 - i'm only using 44 of memory that's good
135:42 - that's an improvement there we go got a
135:45 - random configuration again
135:46 - awesome so now i
135:50 - can make another
135:53 - array
135:57 - and first let me go through
136:00 - and set all of the lights
136:03 - to grid i plus j times columns
136:10 - let's make sure
136:16 - let's make sure this works and i see
136:18 - that it's looping
136:30 - oh
136:33 - do i have my columns and rows mixed up
136:40 - i plus j times columns
136:44 - no i'm doing it correctly
136:48 - looping okay now
136:50 - [Music]
136:52 - let's try figuring out
136:56 - [Music]
136:59 - equals
137:02 - state equals grid i plus j
137:05 - times columns
137:09 - this is not being used by the way
137:12 - count neighbors grid i j
137:17 - so i'll deal with that function if state
137:20 - uh if not state and neighbors is 3
137:24 - it's true if state and
137:28 - neighbors is either of these then it's
137:31 - false otherwise it stays as state
137:36 - this should be the same copy it all over
137:41 - and then now count neighbors
137:46 - columns time rows xy
137:51 - column row
137:57 - no plus i can't add booleans
138:00 - so uh
138:04 - so if it's true
138:09 - sum plus plus
138:14 - and then i'm always taking out
138:22 - itself
138:25 - shoot um
138:29 - can i give it the state
138:35 - like what it's i must have it state yeah
138:38 - [Music]
138:40 - so then i can say after this
138:45 - if state sum minus minus because i don't
138:50 - want to count its own
138:52 - this loop counts everything and it also
138:54 - wraps around
138:57 - yeah it's like i'm doing some crazy
138:59 - stuff here to wrap around i forgot about
139:01 - that
139:02 - [Music]
139:04 - um
139:07 - you can add booleans true and false or
139:08 - just type defs for one and zero
139:11 - oh i did not know that well too late now
139:17 - cannot convert boolean to int star for
139:21 - where was that um do i know what
139:25 - line of code that is
139:28 - can i do the verify thing
139:32 - 88
139:35 - where are the line numbers
139:39 - oh count neighbors
139:42 - grid ij state
139:50 - oh whoops there's some extra junk here
139:58 - so you're saying i can do this
140:02 - [Music]
140:04 - like this is something that i can do but
140:06 - let's not do it right now
140:14 - oh
140:16 - cannot convert boolean to
140:22 - oh no int int boolean
140:27 - ah there we go
140:37 - what am i doing wrong here
140:41 - violet says just use mem copy to copy
140:43 - the array yeah
140:45 - turn on line numbers and settings
140:48 - display line numbers okay thank you
140:58 - oh whoops 63 this is
141:08 - columns not rows okay
141:16 - uh 55 oh i have so many places where i'm
141:20 - still doing this
141:30 - [Music]
141:33 - okay cannot convert boolean
141:38 - aka bull to end i'm so confused about
141:41 - this
141:42 - argument here
141:50 - you know what all right let's get rid of
141:51 - this i don't need to pass in this state
141:54 - this is that's just lazy because i can
141:57 - just look up the state
142:00 - at x and y if grid
142:04 - x plus y times columns
142:07 - that should be the same thing right
142:22 - [Music]
142:26 - count neighbors
142:41 - sum is zero argument one
142:51 - to end count neighbors
143:00 - grid i i mean i could just do this up
143:03 - here
143:03 - i don't need a function grid is boolean
143:06 - [Music]
143:12 - thank you it's been this all along
143:16 - there we go ta-da
143:19 - all right
143:26 - i got it everybody
143:30 - there we go game of life
143:34 - on the everyday calendar i think it's
143:36 - the game of life looks right
143:48 - can we tell if this is right i should
143:51 - have given you a closer view of it
143:54 - i think that's right um
143:59 - i'm running it again
144:08 - it's not as visually apparent as i
144:10 - thought it might be
144:20 - i guess the grid the way the grid is
144:22 - laid out they're not
144:23 - like there's like a strange sort of
144:26 - spacing thing going on
144:35 - um let's see here i'm starting to get
144:37 - kind of tired it's almost six o'clock
144:40 - oh he's sleepy um
144:44 - let's see 12 31 i was thinking about
144:47 - this
144:49 - i think it's actually running i just do
144:51 - i still have a delay in loop
144:53 - oh i don't have the delay in loop
144:55 - anymore
145:00 - oh yeah it looks nice there because it's
145:02 - sort of smaller further away
145:04 - so what i would love to do is be able to
145:07 - touch it
145:09 - and then like effect one of the things
145:11 - and then it'll keep going
145:15 - turn down the other lights in my room
145:17 - okay
145:19 - turn this down i'm turning all the
145:20 - lights off in here
145:25 - um
145:27 - [Music]
145:28 - is it actually better like this where
145:31 - are
145:31 - um where's my phone because
145:42 - uh let's see here i'm gonna turn all the
145:46 - lights off in here
145:48 - okay everything's off now there's
145:51 - sunlight coming in here because it's
145:52 - still
145:53 - light outside so anything i can do
145:57 - with this that turns the light on
146:03 - that's interesting whoa did not mean to
146:06 - do that
146:08 - i probably could
146:12 - just see if i can make this look better
146:15 - darker yeah that's maybe a little better
146:20 - what's this one focus
146:23 - af lock i don't know what that does
146:29 - um all right let us now
146:34 - run it again
146:40 - i think if i kind of come back it'll
146:42 - focus more on me there we go
146:46 - john conway's game of life on the
146:48 - everyday calendar i mean if i just go to
146:50 - here
146:51 - no there's too much glare on it um
146:58 - i'm gonna block out the windows
147:03 - uh all right remove the print statement
147:07 - in the loop yeah i definitely need to do
147:08 - that
147:10 - is that slowing it down a lot
147:15 - the calendar also has a brightness
147:17 - setting i know i think i set it to the
147:18 - most
147:19 - to as bright as possible though 200.
147:25 - well there's nothing i can't have it do
147:27 - here the question is
147:30 - what and why should i have it too i want
147:33 - to get the touch thing
147:35 - working uh
147:49 - apparently random isn't random in
147:50 - arduino and you have to use random seed
147:54 - yeah draw the car there are no curtains
147:58 - i don't think i can change the led color
148:01 - but i can add the touch interface which
148:04 - i would really like to do
148:06 - so let's try that maybe there's a better
148:09 - pattern that i should have done but i
148:11 - think this is pretty good
148:13 - um but i don't know what this
148:19 - i need to like random seed
148:24 - like if i do that or something i'll get
148:27 - a different pattern
148:40 - snake game right i can definitely play a
148:44 - game
148:52 - right
148:54 - i'll make yeah
148:57 - enable a delay after the touch so you
148:59 - can touch several at a time yes that's
149:01 - exactly what i was thinking of doing
149:03 - uh says dave all right let's work on the
149:04 - touch um so let me go back to
149:08 - simone's code
149:12 - and
149:20 - let's go to the everyday calendar
149:25 - and basically i want to now add the
149:27 - touch
149:28 - aspect so if i say touch configure touch
149:31 - begin
149:32 - i don't care about the memory so i'm not
149:34 - going to worry about that
149:38 - let's add in in the configuration
149:41 - [Music]
149:50 - starting starting touch
149:53 - configuration
149:56 - uh and then i don't care about this do i
149:58 - need this delay or is that just
150:01 - to like i think that's okay i don't need
150:05 - that so
150:06 - point previously held
150:11 - oh boy
150:15 - handle a button touch if touch
150:21 - why do i care about all this
150:26 - i just want to know there's like a
150:29 - de-bounce counter
150:32 - interesting like i feel like the api
150:34 - should handle this for me
150:39 - uh so
150:43 - let's let's just try this
150:47 - like i just wanna i just wanna try
150:49 - something
150:50 - do i do this in draw like in loop like i
150:53 - always check
150:54 - this is in loop okay so
151:00 - handle touch interaction if touch
151:04 - like let's just let me just sort of see
151:06 - like if i can just say
151:08 - if touch let me just reset the whole
151:12 - board
151:14 - if there's a touch i'm going to reset
151:15 - the whole board
151:17 - otherwise otherwise i'm going to do
151:20 - the what you're going to call it
151:24 - the game of life algorithm so like if i
151:27 - just touch anything
151:34 - like what if i just touch anything um
151:37 - let's run
151:42 - this which will reset the whole board
151:56 - is that gonna work
151:59 - six o'clock people all right running
152:02 - this
152:02 - low memory
152:05 - why am i using more am i using more and
152:07 - more memory every time i upload it
152:10 - like is it is there a way i can clear it
152:12 - okay
152:14 - so it's running the game of life now in
152:16 - theory if i come over it by the way it's
152:18 - so beautiful in person
152:20 - i'm a little bit sad that you that i
152:22 - don't have a good camera shot of it
152:24 - um i'm gonna touch it
152:31 - so if i touch anything it's resetting it
152:33 - so that works
152:36 - don't use early don't else use early
152:39 - return this will make it slow
152:43 - um stop printing things people don't
152:46 - like me to print things
152:48 - all right fine uh
152:51 - all right so now if i touch
152:58 - x oh these are like specific things that
153:02 - you can touch to do things
153:06 - what if i don't care about a d bounce
153:09 - like what if i just do
153:12 - [Music]
153:18 - um
153:24 - like i turn the one i'm on
153:31 - and then i also say
153:37 - is it grid that i want to set here yeah
153:39 - grid
153:41 - touch dot x plus touch dot y times the
153:44 - number of columns
153:47 - equals true like what if i just do this
153:53 - let's see if this works
153:58 - oops request for remember y
154:02 - and touch which is oh
154:06 - that's not how i get cow
154:10 - touch
154:14 - it's called cal touch
154:20 - let's just try this
154:26 - i'm not worrying about debouncing it
154:38 - okay it's doing the game of i'm gonna
154:40 - let it sort of settle into usually the
154:42 - game of life will ultimately settle into
154:44 - a fixed state
154:55 - it could take quite a while actually
155:05 - instead of a delay try to make it start
155:07 - if you touch the first spot then you
155:08 - will have more control all right
155:13 - so it's really sad to be that you can't
155:16 - see
155:17 - this well um sun sunset
155:24 - uh
155:28 - all right yeah there we go
155:31 - look at that that is cool
155:39 - i mean if i just press once it's going
155:41 - to disappear
155:43 - so i think whoever suggested that i
155:45 - build in a delay
155:48 - makes a lot of sense
155:52 - um let's see could i just if i just even
155:54 - just add a delay here like if i just say
155:56 - hey
155:57 - wait like a second so i could press two
155:59 - maybe
156:05 - it's always doing the same pattern
156:08 - you're right
156:10 - how do i what's wrong with my random
156:14 - let's look at uh arduino
156:17 - brandon
156:21 - min max analog reads zero
156:26 - ah
156:35 - is it always an integer this is what's
156:38 - not clear to me
156:41 - long okay
156:45 - let's try that and then
156:51 - uh
156:55 - i don't think i need that floret
157:00 - does it need to be long let's try this
157:13 - okay
157:17 - that's a different pattern right have
157:19 - you memorized the pattern that it was
157:21 - before
157:24 - i have another webcam and i'm sort of
157:26 - tempted
157:27 - you know i could also just just out of
157:30 - curiosity
157:33 - like whoops not audio recording
157:37 - like what does the webcam here look like
157:43 - that's not really that's definitely not
157:45 - any better
157:48 - okay so now it has
157:52 - ended up in a sort of fixed
157:53 - configuration
157:56 - so i should be able to
158:00 - whoa what happened did this camera go
158:02 - off
158:03 - or it's just super dark what just
158:05 - happened
158:12 - did i lose this camera again
158:19 - yeah it looks like i did
158:27 - whoa oh i moved it around i guess
158:31 - um
158:36 - it's upside down isn't it flip
158:48 - does it help if i turn this light on
158:56 - all right let me go over here now i'm
159:00 - going to try to
159:00 - uh oh that what is wrong with this
159:04 - camera
159:06 - so annoying it's just like dying again
159:10 - sorry everybody i should really just get
159:12 - my other webcam
159:16 - nope wrong one
159:22 - and flip
159:26 - there we go all right hopefully it's
159:27 - going to stay
159:33 - so now i'm going to try pressing buttons
159:36 - on it
159:43 - i want to see if i can get two with the
159:45 - delay stop stop
159:51 - yeah so i'm not
159:56 - it i should really force it to wait
160:00 - um like a certain amount of time
160:03 - um or i could just like have one of
160:07 - these buttons down here always be like
160:08 - stop and start
160:19 - i think i have a i have an idea
160:23 - i have a sort of weird idea of the way
160:24 - that i want to handle this i don't know
160:26 - if this is a smart way of doing it
160:28 - but i hate having this delay here
160:31 - so i'm going to create a variable
160:35 - called
160:38 - interaction and it's false
160:41 - then i'm going to get a i'm going to
160:44 - create a variable that's like called now
160:49 - so if you touch it interaction
160:53 - is true if you touch it or
160:58 - interaction interaction is
161:02 - true and now is
161:06 - um
161:11 - if not interaction so the first time you
161:13 - touch it
161:14 - then we set the time
161:19 - now equals the current millis
161:25 - and then basically if millies
161:29 - minus now is greater than let's say
161:33 - like so i want to give myself like five
161:35 - five seconds i'm gonna give myself a lot
161:37 - of time five
161:38 - seconds then i can say
161:42 - uh interaction is false
161:47 - [Music]
161:52 - so this should allow me to continuously
161:56 - touch it as long and then if i haven't
161:58 - touched one for five
161:59 - seconds it should go and in fact let's
162:03 - see if this is true by actually having
162:05 - them all
162:07 - start well no let me just run it i was
162:09 - gonna have them all start off
162:11 - but let's see i don't know if i made any
162:13 - mistakes in there
162:14 - uh i definitely did millies minus now
162:18 - expected primary expression oh there's
162:20 - like an extra
162:22 - parenthesis there on line 59. okay
162:29 - all right let's try this let's see
162:32 - um
162:36 - and then i want to see if i can kind of
162:37 - get the lighting better in here
162:40 - uh all right so the game of life is
162:43 - going
162:45 - and i'm now gonna walk over to it ah
162:48 - it's so
162:49 - gorgeous oh and of course those cameras
162:53 - why why torturing me so
162:56 - ah i don't understand i i i hate this
163:00 - camera i
163:01 - i have a whole nother webcam i should
163:03 - try that other webcam
163:05 - and see what kind of picture i get from
163:08 - it because
163:15 - that would be better all right let's
163:17 - walk over to it
163:19 - now as lo if i touch one oh no it
163:22 - started going immediately
163:25 - it shouldn't have been able to go for
163:28 - five
163:28 - seconds and if
163:31 - this camera is just dead all right hold
163:34 - on i'm getting another webcam
163:37 - have another webcam here
163:42 - let's try where
163:46 - do not have a very long
163:51 - if i could get the code to work actually
163:53 - then i could get my usb
163:55 - extender um and i could i should just
163:58 - like hold it up
163:59 - but hold on let me try to get this to
164:01 - work i'm dealing with too many
164:04 - things right now um
164:07 - i do want the camera to work though so
164:09 - let's just go over here
164:11 - and uh fix that real quick
164:18 - interestingly you know what i should
164:19 - just do this is what i'm going to do
164:23 - excuse me for a second well i'm going to
164:26 - put this back
164:27 - i have i have an interesting idea here
164:29 - bear with me
164:32 - all right so what i actually want to do
164:33 - is just hide this
164:35 - and i want to go to video capture device
164:41 - and i just want to add this camera again
164:44 - so what i'm going to do especially if
164:46 - i'm sitting over here
164:47 - is
164:50 - i could turn off auto focus on the
164:52 - camera
164:54 - and then it won't be focused on me
164:56 - whoops what is this
165:00 - oh that's the live pole thing
165:04 - uh
165:09 - i mean this is kind of silly what i'm
165:12 - doing because
165:14 - it is the same view just blown up and
165:16 - the focus is not focused on it
165:22 - but at least you will now see it
165:29 - that's not really better anyway
165:33 - okay um is there a way i could get it to
165:35 - focus
165:37 - back there i mean i could turn off the
165:38 - autofocus all right
165:41 - let me get this to work why didn't this
165:42 - work
165:44 - so if interaction is true
165:50 - then don't do any of this calculation
165:54 - stuff
165:56 - and it's the first time we come in here
166:00 - an interaction is
166:01 - false
166:05 - we get the current time
166:12 - and then set interaction to true so any
166:15 - other time that we were here
166:18 - as long as it hasn't been five seconds
166:21 - interaction still has to be true
166:26 - i mean this doesn't have to be here this
166:28 - could always be checking
166:38 - uh i
166:41 - am wondering why i've got this wrong
166:46 - like was five seconds not like what if i
166:49 - did this
166:51 - like it shouldn't be able to get down
166:53 - here
166:56 - shouldn't be able to do this for at
166:57 - least 50 seconds
167:00 - if touch and interaction
167:10 - yeah but i don't know
167:13 - i don't know if touch when touch gets
167:15 - set to false
167:17 - so i appreciate that octopus
167:21 - um that is a very good
167:24 - suggestion
167:27 - anyway i gave myself 50 seconds now
167:31 - right so i should be able to touch it it
167:34 - shouldn't be able to do anything for 50
167:35 - seconds
167:37 - yeah okay now it's working
167:40 - 50 seconds is a long time was five
167:42 - seconds just not enough
167:56 - i wish it wasn't so glarey i need like
168:00 - um
168:03 - i'm gonna work on i'm gonna move the k
168:04 - i'm gonna i'm gonna work on the camera
168:06 - stuff in a bit is millie's not correct
168:11 - it should start going at some point
168:12 - after has it been 50 seconds yet
168:16 - what did i just do by the way that made
168:17 - it super yeah if i stand like here
168:20 - i like i give it i just need to like oh
168:23 - i just need to put up
168:26 - it's the wind the sun coming in the
168:27 - window over here
168:29 - now it's going again so i think my code
168:31 - was right
168:33 - where how can i uh there we go i'm
168:35 - holding up
168:37 - okay yeah i'm blocking the uh
168:43 - the window now
168:48 - now minus millies so people are saying
168:52 - that if state means to check for now
168:53 - minus millies rather than millies minus
168:56 - now
168:58 - i don't believe that's true but
169:01 - i do believe that it should be unsigned
169:05 - long because those numbers can get
169:07 - really high
169:09 - um because oh and now
169:15 - interaction is false i don't think i
169:18 - need i'm never gonna
169:19 - get here um
169:22 - so i think this is good let's give
169:24 - myself
169:26 - let's go back to five seconds again
169:31 - and give myself another chance
169:48 - i do see how anytime
169:51 - touch is true this should get reset even
169:53 - if interaction is not false
169:56 - so that might be separating these two
169:57 - things out might be
169:59 - useful yeah actually
170:03 - here we go sorry i i this is like
170:06 - this or here is a problem
170:21 - so this is really what i want to do
170:25 - as long and this is just like as long as
170:28 - it's not
170:28 - interaction
170:29 - [Music]
170:34 - you can do all this stuff which is
170:36 - actually what i want to say else if
170:40 - interaction
170:47 - yeah this makes more sense
170:53 - so this makes more sense i think now
170:55 - because what i'm doing is i'm saying
170:57 - um if i if i touch it like that's a new
171:01 - moment
171:01 - so get the current time interaction is
171:04 - true
171:06 - if i'm not touching it like if it's been
171:09 - five seconds
171:09 - i haven't touched it then interaction
171:11 - can be false and then i can go on and do
171:13 - the animation i think this is better
171:15 - i think this is gonna be better let's
171:17 - give this a try
171:20 - i really have to go i don't want to turn
171:22 - this off because i want to do so many
171:24 - more things
171:26 - but um
171:29 - we've got a blinking light here thank
171:31 - you for the super chat jay
171:35 - it is getting darker finally so i feel
171:37 - like
171:38 - the good news of me taking a while to
171:40 - like finish streaming
171:41 - right so let's see so now i should be
171:43 - able to touch it
171:44 - and i've stopped it yep so if i'm
171:46 - touching it it's stopped
171:48 - one one thousand two one thousand three
171:50 - one thousand four one thousand five one
171:52 - thousand
171:58 - all right now
172:01 - we are going to
172:05 - not have it be random we are going to
172:09 - start it with
172:14 - it off um what's
172:17 - better i need to get a better um
172:21 - view of it okay
172:24 - so it's everything's off i'm going to
172:27 - walk over here
172:29 - so now i should be able to add a
172:31 - specific pattern
172:35 - and then let that pattern go
172:42 - you can't see that let me do it down
172:44 - here
172:48 - you can see down here better so this
172:50 - pattern in the game of life
172:51 - will oscillate between those two states
172:57 - uh now i don't have a toggle that's
172:59 - unfortunate
173:01 - so there's no way for me to ever turn
173:02 - these off
173:04 - but i think if i put like something near
173:06 - it i might be able to like give it
173:07 - something that
173:08 - would cause it to like just fade away
173:12 - so i probably i should add a toggle
173:14 - possibly that so that'll fade away
173:16 - so i know i can do this
173:20 - and that's gonna fade away let's look
173:21 - for
173:23 - um patterns in
173:29 - let's go i believe there are you know
173:31 - what would be really nice is actually do
173:33 - the wolfram
173:34 - cas because those go scroll down so
173:37 - um there are very specific patterns
173:40 - like this one but i really just want to
173:42 - do the glider
173:46 - gun which i don't like right so here's
173:48 - some
173:49 - patterns there we go um will you stop
173:52 - animating so i can look at you for a
173:54 - second
173:56 - beacon so i should be able to do any of
173:59 - these now
174:01 - um let's
174:05 - try blinker worked right i did the
174:07 - blinker
174:08 - um let's try this
174:13 - uh this one so if i could just freeze
174:16 - this for a second it's making me crazy
174:23 - so i can like look at it i think i sort
174:26 - of know what it is
174:27 - but
174:27 - [Music]
174:32 - let's just try to create this
174:35 - so let me zoom in on this here
174:39 - so i'm going to make this on the
174:41 - calendar
174:43 - so i need to do down down
174:46 - down down and over here so it should be
174:49 - let's let's
174:50 - give it over here one two one two
174:53 - and then this is that right let's see
174:56 - what happens
175:01 - uh oh is my game of life uh is my game
175:04 - of oh i did it wrong
175:05 - i did it wrong awesome wait let's
175:09 - let's see this will probably make it
175:10 - disappear i totally did it wrong
175:13 - it's so funny oh and you can't see it
175:14 - too up there can i just get a sheet
175:17 - and hang it oh wait there is a curtain
175:20 - i never use this curtain hold on
175:24 - we might have a cure to all of our
175:28 - problems
175:33 - a little afraid to do this
175:46 - i'm trying to block out the sun which is
175:48 - not a thing that i should normally do
175:55 - is it looking better and blocked out the
175:58 - sun
176:02 - everything's okay everybody okay i'm in
176:05 - the dark here
176:07 - okay this should be better now now let
176:10 - me
176:11 - let me let me do it correctly
176:16 - there we go that was the correct pattern
176:18 - i think
176:22 - there we go
176:26 - there it is
176:31 - game of life on the everyday calendar oh
176:34 - this is
176:34 - very satisfying right now
176:41 - still the wrong
176:46 - um all right
176:51 - all right well now this is great all
176:53 - right let's have some fun
176:56 - let's have some fun okay uh i
176:59 - am going to reset it
177:03 - so i should probably have a reset button
177:06 - but um i can always just since it's
177:07 - connected to the arduino
177:09 - so i could just unplug the arduino right
177:11 - this thing is always running on it
177:13 - this is the amazing thing about
177:14 - microcontrollers
177:16 - okay um
177:20 - let's let's draw a heart
177:31 - i can't draw a heart
177:34 - oh this is terrible what am i doing i
177:37 - did not have a plan that's the worst
177:41 - heart ever
177:42 - i wasn't actually so bad if i had just
177:44 - gone up
177:46 - and now we've got the game of life going
177:50 - why is it super slow like what am i
177:54 - doing here in the code
177:56 - that has it running so slow anyone have
177:59 - any ideas
178:00 - like i don't have a delay i have no
178:04 - i don't think i have a delay anywhere
178:09 - i i mean i guess it's just these like
178:12 - nested loops are really slow on an
178:16 - arduino
178:25 - anybody have any ideas
178:29 - off by one cell
178:38 - i think it's just the looping over all
178:40 - the cells which i'm doing multiple times
178:42 - so is there a way i could make this more
178:44 - efficient
178:46 - i suppose
178:49 - i don't need two loops
178:54 - because
178:58 - so this might make it more efficient
179:00 - right
179:01 - if i put this here i don't need this
179:03 - extra loop
179:06 - [Music]
179:08 - and then i'm also oh this probably is
179:11 - mem copy is mem copy do a column of 10
179:15 - cells
179:19 - what's the serial stuff
179:22 - that's just all in the beginning though
179:23 - so i think that's fine
179:26 - oh like i don't need any of this
179:30 - i don't need this because i don't need
179:33 - to print stuff anymore
179:35 - because i know it works okay
179:41 - how did i since when did i oh that's
179:44 - from the oh can i use a bull instead
179:47 - is that better
179:51 - should i be using a bull
180:02 - [Music]
180:06 - let's try this let's see what
180:10 - happens here oh you can't see the code i
180:13 - did it again
180:14 - sorry everybody i'm the worst all right
180:16 - so this is what i did i'm so sorry
180:18 - i um i changed from boolean to bull
180:22 - and i'm so sorry and what i did is i got
180:25 - rid of that extra loop
180:27 - in loop on the worst
180:31 - where uh where i was setting the states
180:34 - because if i'm calculating the next
180:36 - state i could just set them here
180:39 - i know i know i know i know
180:42 - it i'm gonna fix it in a second the
180:44 - chat's going a little nuts i
180:46 - i know well it would actually not be so
180:48 - hard
180:49 - to set up an alert where you blink these
180:52 - uh
180:53 - led lights for me that now have fallen
180:56 - to the floor
180:58 - um let's see is this going to be faster
181:11 - not really a little bit maybe can't tell
181:27 - maybe all the debouncing in simone's
181:29 - code is just
181:30 - for the um the calendar where it wants
181:33 - you to do like a long press
181:35 - whereas i don't really need that for
181:37 - this
181:38 - i don't feel like it's going any faster
181:40 - in fact it looks like it's going
181:41 - slow it's oh weirdly you see it updating
181:46 - like in ripples so now actually this is
181:48 - kind of a problem
181:50 - because by moving this here it's kind of
181:53 - like updating as it's doing all these
181:55 - slower calculations
181:57 - so i don't actually know if that really
182:00 - was such a good idea like it might have
182:03 - been better to do this all at once
182:04 - what's so slow here
182:07 - is like calling this function and
182:08 - everything slow
182:11 - like does that have a big overhead
182:16 - is this is
182:19 - mem copy would that be better
182:22 - um
182:26 - it was faster um yeah you could see the
182:29 - looping
182:30 - i sort of think i want i don't want to
182:32 - do that
182:33 - because that seemed weird to me
182:37 - so i'm going to put this back
182:40 - um but i wonder if there's like a lot of
182:44 - overhead in calling this function
182:47 - i mean this is silly for me to like
182:48 - really try to obsessively optimize this
182:49 - right now
182:52 - um so
182:58 - uh and i really uh okay
183:02 - violet's typing i'm gonna wait for a
183:03 - vile i i think i need to stop
183:05 - because it's 6 30 i've been streaming
183:08 - for three hours
183:10 - um i will definitely be sharing the
183:12 - source code
183:14 - um
183:17 - and i'm trying to think
183:21 - of what the
183:24 - the thing is now that i have this
183:26 - working like it's
183:28 - it's so tempting to just like try a
183:29 - different algorithm
183:32 - because
183:36 - um but i think i need to
183:39 - need to um let myself off the hook here
183:43 - but i wanted to just see um if mem
183:46 - copy was better i don't know how to use
183:48 - mem copy
183:53 - well that
183:58 - that seems like maybe i don't want to
184:00 - try that right now what was i want
184:02 - oh what i wanted to do is not call this
184:04 - function
184:07 - so what if i just took this
184:15 - and did that right here
184:27 - [Music]
184:29 - so this would become j this would become
184:33 - k this is also
184:37 - right having this extra loop is kind of
184:39 - nuts
184:42 - i could just manually check each
184:44 - neighbor
184:46 - but i guess because i'm doing the wrap
184:47 - around
184:49 - that would get tricky
184:52 - i don't think so though
185:02 - like this i'm sure this could be
185:03 - improved but let's just see if i don't
185:06 - call
185:11 - don't put this in a separate function
185:19 - i just count the neighbors right here
185:23 - let's see what happens let's set it back
185:26 - to random at the beginning
185:28 - because uh
185:32 - that way it'll just do something
185:33 - immediately
185:37 - whoops
185:40 - oh
185:44 - i don't have the state anymore
185:49 - so this needs to be here and then we'll
185:52 - let's i'm going to add the mem cop i'm
185:54 - just going to see if this
185:55 - sum was not declared
186:04 - 114
186:07 - oh i don't need this function anymore
186:10 - [Music]
186:12 - let's see if this
186:18 - x plus y
186:22 - huh oh oh my god
186:26 - i j i'm losing my mind
186:29 - i j k n
186:32 - that doesn't make any sense i'm losing
186:34 - my mind here oh
186:36 - i'm just gonna use n well this is awful
186:40 - this is i oh these could be x x
186:43 - y i'll do that x
186:46 - y x y this is i
186:50 - plus x this is j plus y
186:54 - and then this is grid i and j again
186:58 - [Music]
187:00 - and let's see what happens there oh my
187:03 - god okay
187:12 - oh calling functions is more than fast
187:14 - enough on the arduino
187:16 - okay yeah i think it's just like slow
187:18 - math it's it's great that it's getting
187:19 - dark out now and it's looking so much
187:21 - nicer
187:22 - and the blur the fact that it's not in
187:24 - focus is actually kind of great
187:27 - um
187:31 - so what was the last thing i was going
187:33 - to try was mem copy
187:36 - so maybe if i do mem copy
187:40 - grid next
187:43 - rows times columns
187:47 - let's see if that works
187:52 - and improves the speed
187:56 - k and l i use j twice but i think i
187:58 - fixed that by now right
188:00 - yeah okay i think this is the final
188:05 - version
188:06 - uh it would be good to be able to toggle
188:12 - so this turns it on how do i get the
188:16 - state of one of them can i query it
188:18 - because it would be called good to call
188:19 - the toggle
188:21 - but i if i toggle it off i have to be
188:23 - able to change it in the grid
188:28 - hmm do we know if
188:34 - uh in the
188:38 - uh in the code here let's look at the um
188:42 - let's look at the library and let's look
188:46 - at the
188:47 - lights oh sorry look at the
188:50 - dot h file
188:55 - see i don't can't query it i can toggle
188:59 - it
188:59 - [Music]
189:01 - but it doesn't tell me what it is so i'm
189:04 - gonna have to keep track of it myself
189:06 - all right i'm just gonna leave it
189:09 - you have the state in the grid don't you
189:13 - i don't know what that means but
189:16 - yeah i think that means this you can
189:18 - just do that
189:23 - i don't know how much more efficient
189:25 - that will be
189:27 - but let's do it
189:33 - no so i know how i can toggle it myself
189:36 - i just wanted um
189:43 - i guess i know i guess i'm keeping it
189:45 - perfectly in sync
189:48 - so why not do this
189:58 - and then set it all right do i trust
190:01 - myself
190:07 - hold on
190:11 - let me just save it in a variable
190:13 - because this is very hard to read
190:28 - so this is me manually toggling it so if
190:31 - i get the state
190:32 - of wherever i touched if i've if my
190:36 - array is accurate then i can toggle it
190:39 - in my array and set the led to match it
190:41 - yeah that should work
190:45 - okay why not
190:48 - i'm going to run this let me actually
190:51 - uh turn off they
190:56 - set them all to zero again or why not
190:58 - i'll let it run
190:59 - all right so now i'm gonna see if i can
191:02 - manually toggle
191:04 - stop
191:07 - oh you know what the problem is i don't
191:09 - debouncing it
191:12 - now i know why simone had the debounce
191:15 - code
191:16 - i have to debounce it you know i could
191:19 - just be happy with like
191:22 - doing like quick taps good enough
191:26 - for me
191:30 - but it's not great
191:34 - i have to make sure you haven't touched
191:37 - it in a while
191:39 - so it needs i'm just going to add that
191:41 - as a to do
191:43 - i'm just going to add that as a to-do
191:46 - uh where is that here um
191:51 - in touch
192:00 - there this will be let me let me put
192:02 - this code somewhere
192:04 - um so
192:08 - let's go to i mean
192:11 - should i make a gitlab account i'm just
192:13 - gonna i'm gonna go to codingtrain
192:18 - and let's make a repo
192:23 - called
192:26 - everyday coding train
192:31 - um public a code for
192:34 - simone yetch
192:38 - is every day calendar experiments
192:43 - um add a readme
192:47 - i will leave this to be mit license
192:51 - create this repo
192:57 - and then
193:00 - let's add
193:05 - where did i put this documents arduino
193:11 - interesting where did i save this
193:18 - sketches
193:22 - for oh the every desktop there i saved
193:25 - it in the desktop okay
193:29 - um all right desktop
193:32 - i am exhausted but this was i can't
193:34 - believe this was actually successful i
193:36 - didn't do what i set out to do
193:37 - which was have uh be able to like make
193:40 - it into a mirror but you know i could do
193:41 - that next
193:42 - live stream i might need to move on to
193:44 - something else
193:45 - uh sketches game of
193:48 - life so i did i make my bouncing
193:53 - yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna upload the
193:55 - bouncing ball too um
194:10 - all right let's add this here
194:14 - anybody who's actually watching this
194:16 - actually have
194:17 - an everyday calendar i'm curious
194:22 - and i would really love to flesh this
194:25 - out to make sure it links to all the
194:27 - appropriate
194:28 - simone yetches things um
194:32 - and i guess i should i could start let's
194:35 - let's
194:36 - let's since it's like dark now and
194:37 - starting to look really nice
194:40 - all right people are asking for to see
194:43 - this one go
194:45 - so let me toggle all these no debounce
194:53 - so this is awful terrible interaction
194:56 - boy software is so like screen based
194:59 - stuff is so easy compared to hardware
195:01 - okay so let me put in the
195:09 - that should soak we do the
195:13 - can we think of something else called
195:14 - beside gun glider
195:16 - gliding sled call it something different
195:19 - there it goes
195:21 - um and let's um
195:24 - just because why not let's um take a
195:27 - look at the
195:29 - bouncing ball which i called
195:33 - this let me just rename it here
195:38 - i think that was this test pattern i
195:40 - call this
195:42 - bouncing ball
195:47 - i kind of want to add gravity to it
195:50 - like have it be like a nice like gravity
195:52 - thing
195:58 - uh slider
196:04 - um i don't think simone is watching but
196:07 - uh if she was i would be like
196:09 - giddy because i'm a very big huge fan
196:11 - [Laughter]
196:13 - uh let's open up this one
196:16 - let's make this a little bit nicer to
196:19 - like have it be
196:21 - so goodbye game of life
196:25 - um this is just the glider oh it's not
196:27 - the glider gun because the gun is the
196:29 - thing that launches gliders so i could
196:30 - just say glider perfectly
196:32 - i just made the glider okay now let's
196:35 - upload this one just to see if it still
196:42 - works
196:46 - there we go so let's make this more
196:49 - physics-y
196:50 - oh boy i'm going to lose my mind i want
196:52 - to like touch it and add them to it
196:56 - i'm going to add let's add gravity to
196:58 - this okay
196:59 - uh point gravity
197:03 - um so can i make a random floating point
197:06 - or no
197:08 - gravity dot x equals zero gravity dot
197:10 - gravity.y
197:11 - equals let's just do this um
197:19 - and then
197:22 - we let me just get rid of all this stuff
197:29 - and now i want to say velocity
197:33 - dot x equals velocity.x
197:37 - gravity.x velocity dot y equal
197:40 - plus equals gravity dot y
197:44 - it's very funny to be coding in the dark
197:46 - here
197:49 - uh we're setting the led
197:53 - um and then
197:56 - we're checking the edges now here's the
197:59 - thing
198:02 - i'm gonna be really gonna overdo this
198:06 - just because
198:12 - i don't want it to get stuck
198:21 - and we're going to check
198:25 - it doesn't need to be left greater than
198:26 - equal 2 is less than 0
198:29 - equals 0. if it's going down i can just
198:33 - check y along the bottom
198:36 - and i'm going to let it go to 31 like
198:37 - i'm just going to consider the bottom 31
198:43 - then it
198:47 - and we're going to reverse it so let's
198:49 - see when i actually put a delay in this
198:51 - one this one is so fast
198:53 - that i'm actually controlling the frame
198:54 - rate okay let's add some gravity here
198:56 - oops
198:57 - what do i got here extra parentheses
199:03 - um let's see what happens
199:12 - i can't tell did the new one go in there
199:16 - it doesn't seem to have any gra hold on
199:25 - i mean i haven't thought about
199:36 - how do i know when it's reset okay
199:47 - tetris somebody already did tetris on
199:50 - this
199:51 - i don't think my gravity is working it's
199:54 - also bouncing off the top which it
199:55 - shouldn't do because i took that out
199:58 - i feel like my code is not making it
200:00 - there
200:07 - i can't stop doing this oh
200:10 - thank you for your uh thank you bartos
200:14 - diver
200:16 - um let's just see it's a
200:26 - gravity
200:31 - oh oh cool well i guess we'll keep going
200:35 - in case
200:36 - simone wants to come say hello
200:41 - um
200:49 - that's exciting i compiled it i did not
200:52 - upload it
200:54 - i do need to feed my children dinner at
200:56 - some point like
201:00 - uh all right oh there you go that
201:03 - gravity is a little bit nuts okay
201:05 - okay let's make the gravity a little bit
201:06 - smaller
201:08 - i just wanna uh look okay oh i'm just
201:11 - verifying it that's what
201:13 - okay i'm checking my
201:20 - power is off in five minutes to save
201:22 - energy no
201:24 - no don't don't i don't want to say i
201:28 - mean i want to save energy
201:31 - yes no disable automatic standby yes
201:33 - okay
201:35 - automatic standby i don't know my
201:37 - monitor might go off
201:39 - is the gravity working now it's too
201:42 - little
201:43 - it's too little gravity let's make it a
201:45 - little bit bigger
201:48 - so how could i make it that every time i
201:50 - touch the screen
201:52 - i add another one
201:58 - all right let's do this when it hits the
202:01 - bottom
202:02 - let's uh have it lose a little speed
202:06 - it's a very low resolution display i'm
202:09 - realizing
202:10 - uh but let's have it lose a little speed
202:13 - because that will help us it's going off
202:16 - the screen
202:23 - [Music]
202:32 - here we go
202:38 - this is lovely okay
202:42 - so i need to make an array of these can
202:45 - you do that
202:46 - how do you make a re can you make a is
202:47 - it a vector how do i do the equivalent
202:50 - of like an arraylist in processing
202:53 - somebody in my family is going to come
202:55 - up and tell me i have to stop at some
202:56 - point the dog needs to go for a walk
203:02 - but now like i'm checking my twitter
203:06 - too much is going on
203:16 - um all right i
203:21 - this is pretty cool an array is a vector
203:23 - yeah okay
203:24 - let me i'm going to save this i'm going
203:26 - to call this now
203:29 - save as bouncing balls
203:33 - so if i already have this as a struct
203:37 - i can make can i make something like
203:39 - this
203:43 - which is a particle
203:47 - can i do this
203:52 - uh can i do this
203:55 - oh all of my physics simulations i can
203:57 - do all of a sudden
204:00 - go feed your children no no no i'm doing
204:02 - this
204:03 - the children they can eat tomorrow
204:06 - [Laughter]
204:10 - so now if i just make a
204:13 - particle p
204:17 - how do i do this can i say
204:20 - p dot pause dot x i just want to make
204:23 - sure this works first
204:31 - is there a previous i need a previous
204:34 - i'm just going to call it pre so they
204:35 - all have the same number of letters
204:37 - as that makes me so happy
204:43 - will this work and then
204:51 - pause pause i hope i'm doing this right
204:54 - i really don't know how to program in c
204:56 - arduino
205:01 - uh pause
205:06 - and this is acceleration now
205:09 - [Music]
205:11 - if this works i should be able to make
205:12 - an array and i could just add to it
205:14 - whenever i touch the thing right
205:20 - can i do object oriented programming
205:32 - this is very meditative i'm quite
205:35 - enjoying this
205:38 - [Music]
205:40 - all right oh the honey drip is still
205:42 - here let's get rid of the honey drip and
205:43 - the clear animation
205:45 - that's much too sophisticated for me did
205:48 - i get everything
205:49 - let's see what happens
205:53 - uh oh what
205:56 - expected oh this needs like that
206:02 - particle is no member named gravity so
206:04 - this is acceleration
206:10 - previous was not declared in the scope
206:26 - okay here
206:30 - we go what do i do
206:34 - verify okay
206:37 - upload come on
206:40 - little bouncing ball
206:44 - i turn my the light on myself by the way
206:48 - all right so i got the bouncing ball and
206:50 - i can still be in the dark
206:52 - um
206:55 - uh okay all right so now
206:59 - um how do i make like arduino
207:03 - vector it's in the reference
207:10 - read the documentation
207:14 - huh okay
207:20 - well i could just make an array with a
207:21 - lot of them and recycle them
207:23 - i'll just make an array with a lot of
207:25 - them that's fine
207:27 - and keep track so how do i do that i can
207:29 - now say
207:32 - how do i make arrays again
207:37 - [Music]
207:38 - how do i make an array and see type
207:40 - array name array size
207:42 - okay uh particle
207:46 - particles like what if i let myself have
207:49 - like a hundred of them is that gonna be
207:50 - it can do i have enough memory for that
208:02 - will that be a problem let's just start
208:05 - with like 10.
208:06 - it's got to be able to do 10 right and
208:09 - so
208:10 - now for
208:14 - do i just do like a regular loop
208:24 - let's just make 10.
208:33 - can i get a random float this is a
208:37 - you know what i'm just gonna do
208:41 - i can't just do like random like i do in
208:43 - uh
208:48 - like if i do this or something
208:55 - do i have like columns and rows
209:06 - [Music]
209:12 - can i do something like this this is
209:14 - like crazy
209:23 - i'm like i don't understand how this
209:25 - works
209:28 - all right let's just do like three of
209:30 - them they should each be doing exactly
209:33 - the same thing but
209:34 - starting in a different spot
209:39 - total does not name a type
209:44 - p was not declared in the scope oh so
209:46 - now
209:47 - i need to say oh
209:50 - yeah okay a particle
209:53 - p equals particles index i
209:58 - i need to do that here too
210:06 - i swear i'm gonna be done soon
210:10 - okay i know i don't need to i was
210:13 - verifying just to check and then okay
210:15 - let's see
210:23 - that doesn't look good
210:26 - floor random calls no i don't think so
210:31 - not all the rows have a link i know but
210:33 - i'm just i have a pretend world where
210:35 - every month
210:36 - has 31. um
210:44 - um
210:51 - what if i can i do
210:57 - will this show me what i want to see
211:00 - uh serial monitor
211:10 - whoops
211:14 - okay oh oh that that makes sense
211:17 - so that worked line 36 mistake
211:24 - no
211:27 - that's fine
211:41 - p is a copy not a reference oh right
211:45 - do i need to do like this or something
211:49 - i don't know c or do i just paste this
211:53 - everywhere
211:59 - oh okay ah could that be the problem
212:16 - why do i only see one should there be
212:19 - ten not three no i changed it to three
212:36 - let's get rid of all of this for a
212:37 - second
212:40 - i should at least see
212:46 - three
212:49 - i should at least see three different
212:52 - ones right
213:02 - zero
213:07 - ampersand
213:12 - oh i do this i haven't done this in so
213:16 - long
213:19 - okay okay okay yeah i have to like
213:22 - de-reference the pointer
213:24 - and then i do this
213:34 - i'm gonna be done soon i swear
213:38 - poor children
213:42 - okay i just this is i'm so close
213:58 - though article
214:01 - [Music]
214:04 - it's i used to know this stuff so well
214:10 - [Music]
214:12 - um
214:14 - like i really studied the sea stuff and
214:16 - i haven't done it since like
214:18 - probably 95 i'm not um since like
214:21 - 2003.
214:26 - um does this have to like also
214:41 - no but i i just want to see the three
214:43 - there i should see three different ones
214:44 - i'm only getting
214:45 - at zero zero
214:52 - [Music]
214:54 - so
215:01 - see what i'm getting here
215:11 - like i should see point a four point
215:13 - eight four point eight four
215:16 - no so i'm not doing it right
215:26 - no
215:28 - [Music]
215:30 - why because i got
215:34 - different values here oh same thing here
215:38 - same thing here i made copies
215:41 - oh okay
216:02 - this is so confusing this is why i just
216:05 - need to do this in p5
216:07 - and then um
216:16 - some i guess i can do a lesson on
216:18 - pointers another time
216:20 - okay great there's my three okay
216:24 - awesome so now i know
216:27 - um
216:31 - let's have them all start
216:36 - in like at least the first four rows
216:40 - um let's have their x velocity also be
216:42 - random
216:44 - [Music]
216:46 - um
216:49 - and um
216:52 - so like negative 0.5
216:56 - plus this
217:02 - and the gravity will be the same okay
217:04 - and now i should be able to put all this
217:06 - back
217:14 - and can i do p
217:16 - dot pause replace with this
217:21 - and then i'm just going to do them one
217:22 - at a time it was just sort of silly
217:24 - because i'm afraid of just
217:34 - okay and then what am i missing
217:44 - that's this
217:51 - this should be here okay
217:54 - i think this is going to work
218:06 - oh whoa cool except i somehow the un
218:11 - turning it off is not happening
218:30 - this is the next
218:38 - oh
218:40 - i'm confused
218:44 - [Music]
218:49 - uh
218:52 - why did i not turn it off
218:56 - so i need to turn the previous one off
219:00 - uh do i save it here previous is the
219:03 - pause and i move
219:05 - yeah i think actually it needs to be up
219:06 - here i think i was just in a weird place
219:16 - there we go
219:21 - there we go
219:27 - [Music]
219:32 - it's like juggling
219:49 - did i just verify it i keep doing that
219:52 - now i really feel like i need to add the
219:54 - thing where when you touch it you add
219:58 - i'm going to do that then i'm done then
220:00 - i'm done
220:05 - oh and there's 10 there's some okay yeah
220:09 - all right so i'm going to do this i just
220:11 - want to know like memory wise
220:14 - can it handle not enough memory
220:18 - not enough memory
220:23 - so 15. it can handle 15. so now i just
220:26 - need to get the touch stuff
220:29 - um and then i'm really going to be done
220:31 - i'm so addicted to doing this i have to
220:33 - stop
220:38 - um okay is this my code no no this wrong
220:41 - thing okay
220:42 - okay
220:45 - i'm so close this is just going to be
220:47 - just this is the last thing i'm going to
220:49 - do
220:49 - i swear last thing
220:52 - uh how do i get to my repositories
220:57 - just need the touch stuff um
221:00 - [Music]
221:02 - repositories i don't want the pin ones i
221:04 - want the most recent one
221:06 - recent one uh what did i call it did i
221:09 - put it under shiftmen
221:10 - every day coding train
221:17 - where's that code i just need to find it
221:22 - uh
221:25 - oh i put it in shiffman
221:29 - whoops i meant to move this in coding
221:32 - i'll move this into coding train later
221:34 - let me just get the um touch stuff
221:39 - so all i need is this
221:48 - [Music]
221:50 - then if touch um
221:56 - and then i get cal touch x i'm just
221:58 - going to grab this
222:05 - if touch i'm not
222:10 - um
222:10 - [Music]
222:14 - particle part par
222:17 - par how do i initialize one i just do it
222:22 - like the way i was going to do it up
222:24 - here okay let's try this
222:26 - it's a very silly way of doing it
222:33 - [Music]
222:37 - r.x equals
222:40 - cal touch dot x right
222:43 - par dot y equals cal touch
222:47 - dot y
222:50 - and then par dot o
222:53 - par.pause dot x
222:58 - and then same with par dot pre
223:07 - and then
223:20 - so this makes a new
223:25 - particle
223:32 - so when i touch it i get a new particle
223:35 - and then particles
223:40 - counter can i do this do i need some
223:43 - kind of like
223:44 - [Music]
223:45 - do i need some kind of pointery stuff
223:47 - there will this work
223:49 - especially if i have a
223:53 - counter set to zero
223:56 - then as soon as i do this i say counter
224:00 - plus plus and then i just only go
224:03 - through the counter
224:05 - and then i can say actually counter
224:08 - equals counter
224:11 - plus one mod modulo total
224:16 - right
224:21 - what's the chance i've gotten this right
224:25 - [Music]
224:28 - here's some of this stuff all right
224:33 - what do we think people verify
224:36 - total was not declared where's the total
224:43 - uh error component one counter multiple
224:46 - definition of counter that's probably
224:48 - like a built in word
224:50 - uh p index
225:05 - oh this is a problem though uh if it
225:08 - gets to be
225:18 - oh let's just do it this way it's fine
225:20 - we'll it'll just restart
225:21 - i don't mind i don't care it'll restart
225:23 - once you get to 15.
225:26 - okay all right everybody
225:34 - this is the last thing i'm going to do
225:37 - somebody wants to like gift this if it
225:40 - works
225:41 - make a gif recording of me doing this
225:43 - and you can capture it for like social
225:45 - media
225:49 - yeah right i touch it and i add one
225:57 - it seems to be running kind of slow
225:59 - let's get rid of that delay
226:00 - oh i've got like what's going on here oh
226:03 - boy i'm
226:05 - accessing some
226:08 - some place that doesn't exist
226:11 - anybody know what would i be getting
226:13 - this
226:17 - uh i don't
226:21 - yeah what did i do wrong
226:36 - well can i turn off just the serial
226:37 - print and i'll let it
226:39 - like access the bad memory and see if
226:42 - that speeds it up
226:51 - p index equals min total minus one
226:54 - oh that's a great idea no but i can't do
226:57 - it p
226:58 - index i got to do another inval variable
227:00 - so
227:01 - i can do thank you for that though
227:05 - which is here which is saying like int
227:07 - end equals minimum
227:09 - p index total minus one
227:14 - i think n is the built in np let's call
227:16 - it that
227:19 - right that should work
227:27 - set to zero
227:32 - all right par that no
227:36 - all right let's see
227:59 - there is a decay it's just very little
228:04 - so especially now that i'm doing it i
228:05 - should put a bigger decay on them
228:07 - and i really gotta stop when this is
228:09 - insane this is like a four hour
228:10 - livestream now i did not mean to do this
228:14 - let's get rid of this delay to see if it
228:17 - runs faster i'm not to fix the memory
228:19 - issue
228:22 - um it's so unbelievably dark down here
228:26 - let me just turn a little light on
228:30 - the opposite problem is true
228:35 - and i gotta get my ipad i was charging
228:38 - so i can play some music again
228:43 - i can't see anything i'll turn on this
228:46 - light just for a second
228:48 - and that's going to be a shock
228:52 - because i'm about to finish up i'll let
228:53 - this go
229:05 - all right let's see here
229:11 - the children and the children are out
229:13 - hunting for food with the dog
229:15 - oh the poor dog this is not the record
229:18 - but it is approaching it
229:19 - i'm sure there's been longer ones okay
229:26 - there we go a little physics
229:29 - in the everyday calendar
229:35 - let's see if i can
229:40 - all right this is going to be my does it
229:42 - look nicer if i do this
229:45 - and then you can kind of yeah let's just
229:47 - or should i leave
229:48 - i just want to like make a nice little
229:51 - well that doesn't make any sense to do
229:53 - i guess it's nice having the code there
229:55 - um
229:56 - let's do this
229:59 - um i just want to leave you all with a
230:02 - nice
230:04 - visual
230:08 - so let's put this here and
230:11 - let's upload it again
230:15 - i don't know i don't know what i'm doing
230:16 - anymore with my with my myself

232:19 - happened to me here
232:21 - okay um is this oh this

237:54 - i'm really getting to something i need
237:55 - my sound effects
238:11 - [Music]
238:26 - all sorts of text generation analysis
238:28 - things
238:30 - that i will use continuously over and
238:32 - over again
238:33 - first thing i need to do is yes
238:50 - [Music]
238:56 - no
