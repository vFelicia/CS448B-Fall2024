00:00 - this is the coding train logo as
00:02 - designed in illustrator I took that logo
00:05 - and made a P5 Jazz sketch drawing all
00:08 - the components I then made a Json file
00:10 - to store all the coordinates and colors
00:13 - this way I could code a shape class that
00:16 - had subclasses line segment and circle
00:19 - to create objects for every component of
00:22 - the logo and each one of these objects
00:24 - is a wrapper for a matter.js physics
00:28 - body I can then load the J on file and
00:31 - create an array of objects of all of the
00:33 - components of the logo itself and
00:38 - Ki
