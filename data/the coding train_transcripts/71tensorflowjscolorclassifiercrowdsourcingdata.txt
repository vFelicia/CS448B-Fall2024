00:00 - all right welcome to a new session of
00:03 - intelligence and learning tutorial
00:05 - compilation thing so this session is
00:07 - going to be a series of videos and I'm
00:09 - going to build a classifier so what do I
00:12 - mean by build a classifier now I've done
00:14 - this before I have some video tutorials
00:16 - where I did a doodle classifier and this
00:18 - is somewhat similar and I'm also going
00:20 - to redo the doodle classifier with a
00:22 - convolutional neural network that's
00:24 - coming but here what I want to start
00:25 - with is a very baseline of just doing
00:28 - classification now in order for me to do
00:32 - a classification example the full story
00:36 - from training testing to deployment of a
00:41 - machine learning model to classify some
00:43 - data I need to first think about data
00:48 - now what I'm going to do in this series
00:53 - is use a trivial data set address a data
00:57 - set that really doesn't have much of a
00:58 - point of view that's not particularly
00:59 - meaningful I just want to show you the
01:02 - full story of how all the pieces work
01:04 - together when I kind of get to the end
01:07 - of this series I'll talk to you a bit
01:10 - more of what where you might find your
01:12 - own data sets how you might collect your
01:13 - own data and sort of think about where
01:15 - you might take this but you know I can't
01:18 - emphasize enough that the data the data
01:22 - that you're using in the data that
01:23 - you're not using is the primary most
01:27 - fundamental piece of all of this if you
01:30 - you know if you just want to try out the
01:31 - algorithm what I'm doing is just fine
01:33 - but if you actually want to build
01:35 - something that classify studying in the
01:36 - real world there are a lot of questions
01:38 - you should ask yourself starting from
01:40 - the very first one is should you be
01:41 - doing this in the first place like is
01:43 - what you're doing good or is it causing
01:45 - harm who's being left out of the data
01:47 - there's lots of really important
01:48 - critical questions you want to think
01:50 - about so putting that aside we'll come
01:53 - back to it at the end the data set that
01:55 - I'm going to use I'm just going to make
01:58 - a color data set so and I'm gonna
02:00 - crowdsource this from you the viewer by
02:04 - the time you're watching this I might
02:05 - have already finished all the
02:06 - crowdsourcing but there'll be links in
02:08 - this video's description
02:09 - it's where you can find the various
02:10 - elements so I'm going to create
02:13 - essentially a spreadsheet it's going to
02:17 - have four columns red green blue and
02:20 - then label so each record each req data
02:28 - point is going to have three values like
02:33 - 255 0 0 and if label is going to be
02:36 - something like you know red ish then I
02:41 - might have 0 255 0 and its label would
02:44 - be green ish so I'm again this is what I
02:48 - mean by totally trivial
02:49 - I am labeling colors into a certain
02:52 - number of buckets reddish greenish
02:54 - yellowish bluish purplish orangish
02:56 - grayish brownish something like that and
02:59 - and I'm gonna have this massive data set
03:02 - won't be that big but a big data set and
03:04 - it's going to learn from this labeled
03:06 - data how to take a new color right there
03:09 - are millions of possible colors 256 to
03:11 - the third power and automatically label
03:15 - it according to what human beings
03:17 - generally think of those colors in those
03:18 - certain categories so this is what I'm
03:20 - going to build so this first part of the
03:23 - video series is just about me figuring
03:25 - out how to collect this data and so the
03:26 - way that I'm gonna do it is I'm gonna
03:27 - make a p5 sketch that shows a random
03:29 - color and gives you a little drop-down
03:31 - menu or a multiple-choice thing so like
03:33 - pick which category and hit submit and
03:35 - it gets saved in a Google sheet and that
03:37 - Google sheet will be this spreadsheet
03:39 - that then I will then use later to load
03:41 - and feed into tensorflow js2 train a
03:44 - model to learn to classify RGB colors
03:47 - according to some set of labels now I
03:49 - would have mentioned that this this idea
03:51 - comes from some work that Hannah Davis
03:54 - is doing here researching at ITP around
03:58 - data and crowdsourcing data she is
04:01 - actually making data set around
04:04 - landscapes and tagging those landscapes
04:07 - with sort of what you might expect field
04:11 - ocean whatever tags you might expect
04:14 - anyway but also thinking about could you
04:16 - have emotional landscapes could you have
04:17 - a data set of landscapes these are
04:19 - landscapes that sort of that that embody
04:23 - the concept of fear or
04:26 - or joy so that might be something you
04:28 - start to think about what kind of
04:29 - creative labels could you apply fixed
04:32 - set of labels to colors there's
04:34 - interesting possibilities there so you
04:36 - might make your own creative version of
04:37 - this but I'm gonna start with something
04:39 - very trivial and exactly as sort of
04:42 - written out here okay so let's go back
04:46 - and I've got a p5 sketch here that I
04:49 - started with nothing in it and I want to
04:52 - add so the first thing I want to do is
04:53 - just pick a random color it's gonna be
04:55 - like the simplest thing ever so I'm
04:58 - going to and by the way I could use a
05:00 - Google Form I could use something a
05:03 - service that that I can pay people to
05:06 - label data like Mechanical Turk or
05:09 - CrowdFlower maybe I'll try to look at
05:11 - some of those in another video but right
05:12 - here I'm going to sort of custom build
05:14 - my own thing and so I am what do I need
05:21 - to do I'm gonna I'm gonna pick up a
05:24 - random a random red value between 0 and
05:32 - 255 then I am going to and I want to
05:41 - floor it because I kinda don't want to
05:44 - deal with floating point numbers there's
05:45 - not really a reason for me to do that
05:48 - and then I want to then I want to show
05:57 - it so I'm gonna say background are RGB
06:02 - and then I am going to what do I want to
06:07 - do now I'm gonna say drop-down equals
06:10 - create select and then I can add options
06:16 - to the drop-down like this let's just
06:22 - see if this works whoops
06:26 - blue fish red fish green ish okay
06:35 - so let's just see what this looks like
06:37 - so now if I go to the browser
06:38 - and look at this sketch and we can see
06:43 - here I've got my drop-down and every
06:48 - time i refresh the page I see a new
06:50 - color and then I can add also submit
06:54 - equals create button submit and submit
07:03 - dot mousepressed submit you know send
07:08 - data and then I can write a function
07:10 - called send data where I am going to
07:15 - send this data to something okay so this
07:19 - is the basic idea we don't need this to
07:23 - be so big there we go so this is what I
07:30 - want each time i refresh this page I'm
07:34 - going to pick a label and I'm going to
07:36 - hit submit and it'll hopefully do suss
07:39 - put that data somewhere where is it
07:40 - going to go I want it to go to this
07:42 - spreadsheet so I want to see the RGB and
07:45 - values and the label end up in this
07:48 - spreadsheet then I'm gonna turn it over
07:49 - to you all and I'm going to get lots of
07:52 - lots of lots of data that I can then use
07:55 - for training the model okay so I need to
07:58 - put this data somewhere I'm actually
07:59 - going to do that in the next part and do
08:01 - that in a separate part I am going to
08:03 - use a service called firebase which I
08:07 - have a whole set of tutorials about so
08:09 - if you want to learn a lot more about
08:10 - firebase I'll link to those tutorials in
08:12 - this video's description but I'm just
08:14 - gonna kind of jump right in and quickly
08:16 - like you know make a firebase project
08:18 - and send all my data there from this p5
08:21 - sketch so but before I go a great great
08:24 - point was made in the chat that this is
08:26 - particularly oops where am i this is a
08:31 - particularly awkward interface
08:32 - especially if I only get to do one I
08:34 - probably should make this that I could
08:35 - like do like five colors all at once but
08:37 - let's say I only get to do one
08:39 - it can be really annoying to have to use
08:40 - this drop-down so one thing I could do
08:42 - is do create radio and then I'll just
08:49 - rename this and in p5 this is a p5 a Dom
08:53 - creation function that I believe should
08:55 - change this to this and you know again
08:58 - the layout here is a little bit awkward
08:59 - I will think about fixing that up but
09:04 - now we can see here the idea here I'm
09:06 - gonna pick blue and hit submit
09:08 - I'm gonna pick reddish bluish and hit
09:10 - submit
09:11 - okay so I just need to you know take
09:14 - this function send data and send the
09:18 - data to firebase and that's what I'm
09:25 - going to do in the next video okay so
09:26 - the next video I'm going to send the
09:28 - data to firebase I'm gonna then upload
09:29 - this somewhere and let those of you who
09:31 - are watching this live
09:32 - give me some data okay see you soon
