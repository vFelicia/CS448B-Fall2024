00:00 - - Hello!
00:01 - And welcome to a new playlist of videos.
00:04 - This is a playlist, hopefully
there's a bunch of videos
00:07 - in this playlist because I'm just starting
00:09 - to record them now so they don't exist yet
00:11 - but this about machine learning and it is
00:12 - for the total beginner.
00:15 - Now there's some caveats
here I suppose to that
00:17 - but I really wanted to make something,
00:19 - you don't have to have
watched any other videos
00:22 - about machine learning on my channel,
00:23 - I have others that go more in
depth and use different tools.
00:24 - This is really meant, if you're starting,
00:26 - it's totally new to you, you've heard
00:28 - the words machine
learning, you've typed them
00:31 - into some learning machine, learning, aah,
00:34 - search bar and somehow
you landed here watching
00:37 - from the future, leaning back,
you've taken your brain out
00:41 - for its afternoon thawing
and you're gelatinous couch
00:46 - is comfortably supporting
your skeletal, okay anyway,
00:51 - the point is you're here, I'm here, hello.
00:55 - So I'm going to be using
for this set of tutorials
00:59 - a pretty new JavaScript
library called ml5.
01:02 - The purpose of this
first video in the series
01:05 - is really just to talk about two things.
01:07 - What is machine learning?
01:08 - What is ml5?
01:09 - So the one caveat I would say, possibly,
01:11 - to being a beginner here
is that you probably want
01:15 - to have some knowledge and
experience with coding itself.
01:19 - Now that isn't to say that
you aren't, if you don't,
01:21 - you're welcome here, please
watch, I will point you
01:24 - to other videos that can help
you fill in some missing gaps
01:27 - but I'm going to assume
a little bit of knowledge
01:29 - about programming,
particularly in JavaScript
01:32 - and I'm also going to be
making fairly heavy use
01:35 - of another JavaScript library called p5.
01:37 - So if p5 is new to you, I'll refer you
01:40 - to some other p5 tutorials.
01:41 - I will but that's going
to be a large piece
01:45 - of how I build various examples throughout
01:47 - all these videos.
01:48 - Okay so before I start talking
to you about what is ml5,
01:53 - which is really what I'm here to do,
01:55 - let's just ask ourselves a question.
01:56 - First of all, it's called
ml5, ml for machine learning,
01:59 - what is machine learning?
02:01 - Now there are lots of
terminology out there.
02:02 - Machine learning, deep learning,
artificial intelligence,
02:05 - neural networks, the list
goes on and on and hopefully
02:09 - the definition that whatever
I say to you right now
02:12 - doesn't really matter because we're going
02:14 - to sort of explore this
topic of machine learning
02:16 - and all these other, all
this other terminology
02:19 - throughout these videos
bu I think one thing
02:21 - to realize about machine
learning, you think of this idea
02:24 - of artificial intelligence,
computers, robots taking over
02:27 - the world and they've
learned their own language
02:29 - and they're defeating
our, but you know, really,
02:32 - when it comes down to it,
brass tacks so to speak,
02:35 - machine learning is examining some data,
02:39 - a whole lot of numbers
02:41 - and trying to make sense of that data
02:45 - and teaching a computer
basically to learn patterns
02:48 - that we can present, that's really,
02:50 - and we're not talking about something
02:52 - called supervised learning here, whoa,
02:54 - even more terminology,
supervised learning,
02:57 - I'm gonna get into all
that and I've gotten
02:58 - into some of that in other videos.
03:00 - So I just pulled up some
notes that I made for a course
03:03 - about artificial
intelligence and at NYU here
03:07 - and this is sort of a classic definition
03:10 - of machine learning from 1959,
03:15 - Arthur Samuels, a field of
study that gives computers
03:18 - the ability to learn without
being explicitly programmed
03:21 - and so let's think
about that for a second.
03:24 - This is actually useful
and I'm gonna get into ml5
03:27 - in a second but just humor
me for a little bit longer.
03:31 - I might say something like
the most simplistic sense,
03:36 - I could write a program that
has a specific algorithm
03:41 - that says
03:43 - if
03:45 - mouseX
03:46 - >,
03:48 - so let's say this window has
a width between zero and 400,
03:52 - its mouseX is > 200,
03:55 - then
03:57 - that is the right side.
04:00 - Can you see this?
04:02 - Yes.
04:03 - > 200 is the right side.
04:04 - Else, if mouseX is < 200 or
just else that's the left side.
04:10 - This is me providing the
computer, so to speak,
04:14 - I've written a program
to some intelligence.
04:16 - It knows how to tell if a
point is on the right side
04:19 - or the left side of the window.
04:21 - I have written the algorithm for that.
04:23 - Well machine learning is
about teaching a system
04:27 - to understand a data
without explicitly writing
04:32 - your own algorithm, this
might be the most trivial,
04:35 - simplistic algorithm ever but the way
04:38 - I would do machine learning
is I would say hey,
04:41 - machine learning system,
I'm going to give you lots
04:46 - of information, like 350 is
on the right side and 301
04:51 - is on the right side and
212 is on the right side
04:53 - and 273 is on the right side
and 100 is on the left side
04:57 - and 97 is on the left side
and 24 is on the left side
05:01 - and 198 is on the left side.
I'm creating a data set
05:04 - and I'm just gonna say
here's a lot of stuff,
05:06 - I'm not gonna tell you how to,
don't, I'm not gonna give you
05:09 - some specific hard coated
algorithm to know what's
05:12 - on the right or the left,
I'm just going to create
05:14 - a data set, it's going to
have a lot of information
05:16 - in it and the machine is
going to learn the patterns
05:20 - in that data, learn how to
make some kind of prediction,
05:25 - that's a key word here,
the prediction being
05:28 - is this point on the right
or left based on that data.
05:30 - This is the essence of machine learning,
05:33 - teaching a computer to perform a task
05:36 - without explicitly programming
the algorithm for that task.
05:41 - Now, it's a little convoluted
'cause aren't we programming
05:44 - the machine learning
algorithm and that's sort
05:46 - of programming but this
is the conceptual idea.
05:49 - Okay, so now that we, as best as I could,
05:52 - made some definition, created a definition
05:55 - of machine learning, one that
at least we can start with
05:57 - and I'm sure I'll hear
from you in the comments.
05:59 - Let's talk about what is ml5.
06:01 - So before I talk about what is ml5,
06:03 - I wanna just mention
someone to you, Red Burns,
06:05 - who is the founder of the program
06:07 - where I currently teach called ITP.
06:09 - Red Burns is a huge source of inspiration,
06:13 - she was a mentor to me
and I wanted to start say,
06:16 - I wanted to read a few quotes from her.
06:18 - I actually have a whole
book of Red Burns quotes
06:20 - but these I think, these
quotes are really important
06:21 - and they are the kind of
driving principles behind
06:24 - a lot of the work that
I do but in particular
06:27 - a lot of the reasons
behind the ml5 project so,
06:32 - "technology is not enough."
06:36 - "Consider the technology," I
should really move the mouse.
06:40 - "Technology is not enough."
06:44 - "Consider the technology
as a tool which, in itself,
06:47 - "could do nothing."
06:48 - "Treat the technology as
something that everyone
06:50 - "on the team could learn,
understand and explore freely."
06:55 - So this is really important.
06:59 - Don't believe the hype.
07:01 - Is that an expression that people say?
07:03 - But it's easy to get caught up in
07:04 - the shining technology stuff but we have
07:07 - to remember that without human
beings here on this planet,
07:14 - right, what's the point? So
while I'm really interested
07:16 - and I get lost in my
interesting just sort of numbers
07:19 - and algorithms and patterns
and things like that,
07:22 - that's I think a sort of core
value that I want to make sure
07:24 - I stay grounded to throughout anytime
07:27 - that I'm looking at algorithms
and thinking about how
07:30 - to use technology, how to teach technology
07:33 - and how to make use of it.
07:35 - So this is actually from an
article from the ITP Journal,
07:37 - Adjacent, there will be a link to this
07:40 - in this video's
description which describes
07:41 - sort of the background about the machine,
07:44 - ml5 project itself. At the end
of this video, I want to talk
07:47 - about various people
who made contributions
07:50 - which I have here on this
link so I will do that
07:52 - but let's talk about what is ml5.
07:54 - So in order to kind of
figure out what ml5 is,
07:59 - I'm going to try to make some diagrams.
08:03 - This is gonna be great.
08:05 - I can feel it right now.
08:07 - So I'm gonna put ml5
right here in the center.
08:11 - Now, an important component
of this discussion
08:15 - is a library called p5.js.
08:19 - Another really important
component of this discussion,
08:24 - I'm gonna put it up here, is
a library called TensorFlow.js
08:30 - and, oh boy, oh boy, another
really important part
08:35 - of this discussion is just
the library TensorFlow itself
08:40 - as well as you know maybe sort
of this thing called Keris
08:44 - which I might refer to.
08:45 - So first of all, what is ml5.js?
08:48 - Ml5.js itself is just
a JavaScript library.
08:55 - It is a library of
functions that you can call
09:01 - from your own JavaScript code.
09:03 - So again, I mention that I'm
gonna rely heavily on p5.
09:06 - P5 is also just a JavaScript library.
09:09 - P5 is a little bit of a
special JavaScript library.
09:14 - Make a little heart there.
09:16 - A couple stars.
09:17 - Because it is really, it
doesn't necessarily conform
09:20 - to the standard patterns you might find
09:23 - in other JavaScript libraries.
09:24 - It makes a lot of
decisions to be as friendly
09:27 - and welcoming and well-suited
for a beginner as it can be.
09:30 - So one of the things you
can do in regular, in p5,
09:33 - is you can write a function called setup
09:37 - and any code that you
put in setup executes
09:42 - the moment the program starts.
09:44 - You can write a function called draw
09:48 - and any code that you put in draw happens
09:51 - in a loop over and over again
09:52 - and this is a standard
kind of design pattern
09:55 - for writing a program that
generates an animation
09:59 - like a game or a piece of interactive art.
10:02 - So what I'm saying here
is that my examples
10:04 - that I'm gonna show you
in these video tutorials
10:07 - are using p5.js almost as
like the base starting point
10:10 - and then I am also going
to import the ml5 library
10:14 - so I need to import
both of these libraries
10:17 - and I'll show you how to
do that in the html file,
10:22 - which is something you'll
see in the code examples
10:24 - and once I have the ml5 library,
10:26 - I can start to do things like this.
10:29 - Ml5 image classifier.
10:33 - So this is a function setup,
is something that's sort of
10:37 - specific to p5, draw is
something specific to p5
10:41 - and then image classifier
well we kind of know
10:44 - it's specific to ml5 because I had
10:46 - to write ml5.imageclassifier
so this is one thing
10:49 - I'm a little bit off on a tangent here
10:52 - which is no surprise if you
watch any of my videos before
10:55 - but a lot of JavaScript
libraries are name spaced
10:58 - meaning if I'm gonna call a function like
11:01 - the image classification function,
11:02 - I've gotta say the name of the library dot
11:04 - that function name.
11:05 - So image classification,
this is one of a common task,
11:08 - common machine learning
task, right, I'm gonna say,
11:12 - "Hey, machine learning, here's some images
11:15 - "of kitty cats, here's
some images of puppy dogs,
11:19 - "learn about them."
11:20 - And we're gonna see how you
could do that exact kind
11:23 - of task with ml5 itself.
11:25 - Okay so this is the basic idea.
11:28 - (sighs)
11:29 - Now, why am I talking about this?
11:33 - So here's the thing.
11:34 - If you just were wandering
around the streets of,
11:38 - I don't know, Venice, Italy,
11:40 - I don't know why I thought of that,
11:41 - they don't have streets,
it's all, like, canals,
11:43 - oh my god, that's crazy.
11:45 - You're paddling through
the canals of Venice, Italy
11:50 - and you go to the little canoe.
Is that what they call it?
11:54 - No, the boat next to you, and you say,
11:56 - "Hey, do you know how
to do machine learning?"
11:58 - Somebody will probably
say, "Oh, you just go use
12:00 - "the thing called TensorFlow."
12:02 - Now it is possible they
say something like,
12:03 - "Oh you just go use this
other thing like pie torch,"
12:05 - or I don't know, something else.
12:08 - But there are many, many
examples of libraries,
12:12 - most of 'em open source
libraries that have
12:16 - a lot of functionality for
common machine learning tasks.
12:19 - One of the most well-known ones of those
12:22 - is called TensorFlow.
12:24 - This is a project from Google.
12:27 - It is open source and most of the time,
12:30 - if you are using it, you
would be writing code
12:33 - in the Python programming language.
12:36 - Well in my tutorials,
I will be writing code
12:39 - in JavaScript programming languages,
12:41 - programming language, not in Python.
12:44 - Well, amazingly, there
happens to be this other thing
12:47 - called TensorFlow.js also
developed by Google researchers,
12:52 - I will include a lot of information
12:55 - about how you can find
out more information
12:57 - about TensorFlow.js and the
creators of TensorFlow.js
12:59 - in the video's description
but this is a version
13:02 - of TensorFlow written in JavaScript.
13:04 - Now in truth, TensorFlow
really, by the way,
13:07 - is really running C++ code so
even when you write your code
13:10 - in Python, it's just running
other stuff that's C++
13:13 - but that's not the case
with TensorFlow.js.
13:15 - TensorFlow.js is everything's
happening in JavaScript
13:18 - and ml5 and you could go and
just use TensorFlow.js directly
13:23 - to do your machine
learning stuff and I have
13:25 - some video tutorials that
talk about that but ml5
13:28 - is a project that actually
wrap, that is a layer,
13:33 - it includes TensorFlow.js
so ml5's a library
13:36 - where additional functions
were added on top
13:41 - of TensorFlow.js to make
certain tasks easier
13:44 - and in truth, this is a low level library.
13:47 - I mean if you were to use it directly,
13:49 - you have to really worry about
things like memory management
13:52 - and this kind of stuff
is eh, it's interesting,
13:58 - you could do it but if
you're just getting started
14:01 - and want to learn the
basics of machine learning
14:04 - and experiment and play, this
is going to be in your way.
14:07 - It's gonna make things
take longer and so ml5,
14:09 - the goal is to make a lot of
the things that you're doing
14:14 - in TensorFlow.js a bit
easier and more accessible.
14:17 - Okay so here's the other thing
14:19 - that I really want to discuss.
14:23 - There are three, I would
say, I'm gonna give you,
14:27 - I'm gonna talk about three
components of the field
14:30 - of machine learning right now.
14:34 - There are particular
machine learning algorithms.
14:37 - One example of that is
something that you might
14:39 - have heard of called a neural network.
14:42 - This is an algorithm to
perform machine learning task.
14:46 - There are many other
examples of algorithms.
14:49 - There are also, there's something known
14:53 - as machine learning models
14:55 - and in particular, there's this
idea of a pre-trained model.
15:00 - So I want to talk about that in a second
15:04 - and then of course we have this
idea of data and data sets.
15:10 - So I'm going to circle
this here for a moment.
15:13 - I'm going to put my stars next to it
15:17 - because this is essentially
where we will begin.
15:22 - You and me and the people from the future
15:25 - who are watching this video
15:27 - or that have time traveled
in to the past, I don't know.
15:29 - Whatever.
15:30 - This is where we're gonna begin.
15:32 - Now, most machine, a lot of
machine learning tutorials
15:35 - will start with something
like and now we will look
15:37 - at linear regression, it's
kind of somewhere in that thing
15:39 - where I was like, I had
that line in the middle
15:42 - of the window or the points
on the right or the left
15:43 - and we're gonna do linear, so
there's a lot of mathematics
15:45 - and statistical components of
machine learning algorithms
15:49 - but one of the things that is
happening in the world today,
15:55 - the reason why I'm hoping
that this video tutorial
15:58 - and this ml5 library
is important and useful
16:02 - is that our lives are
increasingly being governed
16:07 - by pre-trained models.
16:11 - Corporations train models
to perform a particular task
16:14 - to recognize your face, to
turn the words you're speaking
16:18 - into text, there are questionable,
16:22 - many questionably ethical
applications of this.
16:25 - There are also fun, artistic
and playful applications
16:28 - of this so one of the ways
I think to get started
16:31 - as a beginner to machine
learning is actually not
16:33 - to learn all the math
and learn how to train
16:36 - all your own machine learning systems
16:39 - but to actually make use
of some pre-trained models
16:41 - that are out there, for example, the thing
16:44 - that I'll start with in the next video
16:45 - is a model called mobile net.
16:48 - This is a model that's
been trained to recognize
16:51 - the content of images but
there are lots of images
16:54 - that I could show to that
model that it will have
16:56 - no knowledge about and other
ones that it will weirdly have
16:59 - a incredibly obscure
detailed knowledge about.
17:02 - Why is that?
17:03 - Well what was the data that
was used to train that model?
17:06 - What was the algorithm?
17:07 - What algorithm is that model using?
17:09 - These are the critical important questions
17:12 - that we of citizens of this
world increasingly governed
17:16 - and controlled by software
need to feel confident
17:19 - and capable of asking and so by taking,
17:23 - by friendly and accessible,
approachable ways
17:27 - of being able to experiment
with pre-trained models,
17:30 - this is a good place to start.
17:32 - All right so machine learning is a thing,
17:34 - it's the thing people are talking about.
17:36 - We wanna get some experience
playing around with it,
17:40 - experimenting with it,
understanding what it is.
17:42 - We're gonna use this ml5 library.
17:45 - I'm gonna show you how to import it.
17:47 - I'm gonna show you how to
import it into a p5.js sketch
17:50 - and I'm gonna show you how to start
17:52 - to use pre-trained models
and we're gonna look
17:54 - at what those models do well,
what they don't do well,
17:56 - where do they come from and
why do they exist, okay.
17:58 - So actually before I go, let's
look at a couple more things.
18:03 - All right, so you know I've
encourage you actually before
18:05 - you watch the next video,
if you're continuing
18:07 - to watch these videos,
to just check out the,
18:09 - go to ml5.js.org, I would
encourage you to click on,
18:12 - there's lots of stuff to read
about here but I encourage you
18:14 - to click on examples and go
down and just try all of these.
18:18 - So you can see there's
some pre-trained models
18:21 - that I'm gonna be using, I'm
gonna do a tutorial basically
18:23 - about each one of these,
notably I'll mention one
18:25 - called PoseNet which
actually can take an image
18:28 - and estimate your pose,
meaning where your hands,
18:30 - where your shoulders, where your eyes,
18:33 - where your hips, I might be getting that
18:35 - somewhat wrong there but
that's a pre-trained model,
18:38 - just like a pre-trained model learns how
18:40 - to classify the content of an image,
18:43 - here's a pre-trained model that looks how
18:46 - to figure out where the human
body is in a particular image.
18:48 - So we'll be looking at
those, I encourage you
18:50 - to sort of click around here.
18:54 - I also want to just quickly
go to this twitter thread
18:57 - that I posted, just to
kind of give a little bit
19:02 - of background and particularly
credit because ml5.js
19:05 - is not a library that I created,
it's a project certainly
19:07 - that I have worked on
but it came from many,
19:09 - many other people so
first thing to mention,
19:11 - and I did talk about this,
that ml5.js is a layer
19:15 - on top of TensorFlow.js so
all of the heavy lifting
19:19 - behind the scenes really comes
from this library which was,
19:21 - many people are working
on and contributing
19:22 - to this library at Google and otherwise
19:24 - but the project was initiated
by Nikhil and Daniel,
19:25 - researchers at Google.
19:27 - The development was funded
by, with the support
19:30 - of the Google Big Picture Group,
19:32 - the Google Big Picture
Group and the people
19:35 - at + AI Research Initiative which was led
19:38 - by Martin Wattenberg and Fernando Viegas.
19:41 - And they've done a lot
of wonderful projects
19:45 - about visualization and machine learning.
19:48 - The style and approach of
our library really comes from
19:52 - the processing foundation, I
mentioned the relationship,
19:56 - I guess I meant to say the
reason why the 5 is here
20:01 - is because of the sort
of symbiotic relationship
20:05 - with p5, we've made sure, ml5 library,
20:08 - you absolutely do not
need to use p5 with it
20:11 - but it is fully compatible
with p5 and the spirit
20:15 - of p5 I think, in its welcoming
and inclusive sensibility
20:22 - is a present in the ml5 library
and so as a thank you to p5,
20:28 - we've used the 5 there.
20:30 - Okay.
20:35 - Cristobal Valenzuela who is
also the creator of runwayml
20:39 - which you should definitely check out,
20:42 - started this project at ITP
by creating a few examples
20:44 - with the deeplearn.js library
which is what TensorFlow,
20:48 - which is what became TensorFlow.js.
20:51 - Yining has done amazing work
on importing style transer,
20:56 - Yining she and pix2pix models into ml5.
21:00 - This is, tha's really wonderful.
21:02 - Pikachu, edge to edge Pikachu,
Yining hopefully will either
21:05 - be making her own videos
that I will point you to
21:08 - or I'll have her in as a guest
to go over some of these.
21:11 - Hannah Davis has done a lot
of work around data collection
21:15 - and responsible data
collection that I encourage you
21:17 - to read about and find on the ml5 website
21:20 - through an artist residency.
21:22 - Nikita Huggins, a resident
researcher at ITP really did
21:25 - a ton of work, project
management work, vital,
21:29 - important work in shepherding the library
21:32 - through many different stages.
21:35 - The ml5 logo on the website
is designed by Alejandro.
21:38 - Hayeon Hwang also gave
lots of support to that.
21:44 - Dan Oved actually ported the PoseNet model
21:48 - to TensorFlow.js and
ml5.js, I'll be showing this
21:51 - in some video tutorials in the future
21:53 - and the ITP Adjacent Journal
which I did mention also,
21:56 - thank you to Stephanie Koltun
who did all the editing
22:00 - for that article and I
encourage you if you really want
22:02 - to read more about the
background instead of listening
22:04 - to me ramble, you can check that out.
22:06 - We had a lot of guest
artists who came to visit us
22:08 - and give us lots of inspiration
and ideas throughout
22:11 - the process and then many
organizations allowed us
22:14 - to do some of the first
experimental workshops.
22:17 - School for Poetic Computation, Eyebeam,
22:19 - Creative Coding Fest, ITP camp and yeah.
22:24 - And there have been
many other contributors
22:27 - that you can find if you go
to ml5js.org and you click
22:32 - on code and browse the github repositories
22:36 - and see all the wonderful
people who have contributed.
22:39 - So this has been my introduction to ml5,
22:42 - the library itself and guess what,
22:45 - if you made it through
this video, congratulations
22:47 - because in all the rest of the videos,
22:50 - I'm really just going to be
coding and talking through
22:52 - how to make certain
examples, how they work
22:54 - and what the pieces of those examples are.
22:56 - So thanks for watching this first video
22:59 - and I'll see you in the next
one which the first thing
23:01 - I'm gonna do is just make a
simple image classification
23:04 - example using the mobile net model.
23:06 - See ya there, maybe.
23:08 - (upbeat music)
