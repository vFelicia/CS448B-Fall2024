00:55 - background we will be starting
00:57 - in about three or four minutes
01:00 - um and today is a very special uh live
01:03 - stream of the coding train with a guest
01:04 - antonio roberts i encourage you to read
01:06 - all about
01:07 - antonio in the video description right
01:09 - now if you want
01:10 - to learn more and we'll be back i'll be
01:12 - back in just a few minutes to
01:14 - say a more proper hello

04:15 - hi everyone we'll begin in about two
04:16 - minutes so one of these days i will have
04:18 - a countdown timer that appears in the
04:22 - pre-show animation but

04:27 - [Music]
05:13 - as always
05:25 - [Music]
06:19 - hello good afternoon everyone welcome to
06:22 - the coding train
06:24 - now whenever i have a guest video i
06:25 - always feel more ridiculous about
06:27 - using the train whistle because i feel
06:29 - like i'm revealing something about
06:31 - myself
06:31 - even though i do it all the time and all
06:33 - of the people who are watching now watch
06:34 - but
06:35 - i know that there's a really wonderful
06:37 - person waiting in the wings to come and
06:38 - present today so i feel a little
06:40 - conscious self-conscious okay um i want
06:43 - to get i know that i tend to do a lot of
06:45 - rambling at the top
06:46 - um and you know if i'm doing a coding
06:48 - session on the coding train it'll be
06:49 - like 45 minutes before i actually get
06:51 - started with anything but i just want to
06:54 - so i want to try to get started with the
06:56 - main content of today's live stream
06:58 - as soon as possible at the same time i
07:01 - want to make sure that everything is
07:02 - working okay
07:04 - that you can kind of hear me and see me
07:06 - and
07:07 - and all of that stuff so um
07:11 - so how is it how's it going um so
07:14 - while i'm waiting to hear any quick
07:16 - messages in the chat
07:17 - um let me quickly just give you set some
07:20 - expectations for today
07:21 - so this will be um somewhere in the
07:24 - range of one
07:25 - hour to 90 minutes one to one and a half
07:27 - hours so here i see myself in all my
07:29 - preview places okay
07:30 - everything's fine people will tell me if
07:33 - the
07:33 - stream went down it's so strange um
07:38 - um so the bulk of today's live stream
07:40 - will be a guest a presentation from
07:42 - antonio roberts as well
07:44 - as a recording of a live coding
07:47 - performance that i am so excited to play
07:49 - for you
07:50 - um uh you'll be able to watch that
07:52 - performance afterwards we'll
07:54 - have a link to just that video alone as
07:55 - well um and
07:58 - um well so that is going to be the bulk
08:00 - of the time today and
08:01 - um so there'll be a presentation a lot a
08:03 - recording of a live performance
08:05 - and then a little time for q a
08:07 - afterwards
08:08 - um how's everything going everybody says
08:11 - my
08:12 - my discord chat is so quiet i just see
08:15 - no messages at all which makes me
08:17 - a little worried but i'm pretty sure
08:21 - everything is fine like myself uh sound
08:24 - is good
08:25 - says coding my life uh lizzie says hello
08:28 - cat food is this the lizzy that's going
08:30 - to make an appearance um
08:32 - uh it is that's very exciting oh okay
08:34 - everybody's here i gotta get moving let
08:35 - me
08:36 - switch over to start doing some
08:38 - introductions
08:40 - um oh actually so this is what i want to
08:43 - say a little coding train news
08:45 - uh breaking news it's not breaking news
08:47 - a little coding train news
08:49 - um just before i begin i i have to play
08:51 - this weird sound effect
08:52 - okay um so um
08:56 - there i have a backlog of about 10 to 15
09:00 - video tutorials that are currently being
09:02 - edited and produced
09:03 - all of those are from the nature of code
09:04 - series and they will all be coming out
09:06 - over the next few weeks
09:08 - um live streams from today for about
09:11 - three weeks are going on
09:12 - hiatus so you won't see any live streams
09:14 - from me until mid
09:16 - april so i just wanted to let everybody
09:17 - know that but stay tuned to future
09:19 - coding training that's going to be
09:20 - you know it's possible that we'll have
09:22 - like one uh uh
09:24 - oh i muted the breaking news sound
09:25 - effect darn i forgot

09:29 - that in my ears and it was just
09:31 - delightful
09:32 - um but um so stay tuned stay tuned to
09:35 - the channel there's going to be lots of
09:36 - new tutorials coming out over the next

09:54 - um so this is antonio roberts's website
09:56 - um please check it out but i also wanted
09:58 - to say
09:59 - um in addition to um the guest
10:02 - presentation that we're having today
10:03 - today's live streams is a fundraiser for
10:06 - a wonderful organization um called
10:09 - um coders of color so coders of color is
10:12 - an organization aimed at empowering and
10:14 - enabling young underrepresented people
10:16 - of color
10:17 - to pursue a career in tech by providing
10:19 - them with a safe space for them to learn
10:21 - explore and grow so they do this
10:24 - primarily by running
10:25 - free coding workshops for young people
10:27 - it's an organization that i
10:29 - have been following online through
10:30 - twitter they're based in the uk
10:33 - they have a very hands-on approach to
10:35 - support they believe that all their
10:36 - attendees should leave
10:38 - each of the events with the ability to
10:39 - do something new and they are there for
10:41 - them if further support is required
10:43 - so far coders of color has supported
10:45 - over 750 young people
10:47 - through workshops and programs out of
10:49 - the young people they have supported
10:50 - some have continued studies in computer
10:52 - science
10:53 - up to undergraduate level and others
10:54 - have secured their first job
10:56 - in tech with their help and support so
11:00 - um um they're currently
11:03 - um donating spare laptops to young
11:05 - people in need of them across the uk
11:07 - they've also had requests from people
11:08 - based in new orleans and here in the
11:10 - united states
11:10 - morocco and nigeria if you're based in
11:12 - any of these cities or countries and
11:14 - have a spare laptop
11:15 - please reach out um all the the links to
11:18 - the coders of color website
11:19 - um and their twitter account or the
11:22 - where you can see get in touch here
11:23 - is um is all there so antonio's um going
11:26 - to speak a little bit more about
11:27 - coders of color and and and his
11:29 - relationship to them um later in his
11:31 - presentation as well
11:32 - i just want to point you to the
11:34 - fundraiser that we set up
11:36 - um for this fundraiser page for this
11:38 - particular live stream now ordinarily i
11:40 - love to try to integrate the fundraising
11:42 - with youtube's built-in
11:44 - giving network but they're a uk-based
11:47 - organization so i wasn't able to do that
11:49 - but

12:04 - chat feature
12:05 - so i would like to say like um that
12:08 - super chat feature i would encourage you
12:09 - to donate um to coders of color through
12:11 - this website that's my
12:13 - preferred uh advice to you and i see we
12:15 - already got
12:16 - another ten dollar attempt sorry ten
12:19 - pound i'm very uh

13:01 - excited to introduce to you
13:04 - it says here that i'm talking look at
13:06 - this the talking
13:08 - daniel schiffman but soon in a moment um
13:11 - antonio's gonna be talking
13:12 - um let me read this um let me go back to
13:14 - his website and read a short
13:15 - introduction for you
13:17 - and i i'm really i just want to say like
13:19 - i'm so excited about this because
13:21 - and by the way i know you can hear my
13:23 - children screaming in the background
13:24 - there's nothing i can do about that
13:25 - sorry sorry everyone quiet down down
13:28 - there
13:29 - soon i get to mute myself um so i live
13:32 - coding has been something that i've
13:34 - never done myself
13:36 - but it's something that i've followed
13:37 - and experienced the algo rave scene
13:40 - different new environments for live
13:41 - coding coding in terms of performance
13:43 - it's
13:44 - really exciting and an engaging way to
13:46 - express yourself and use the tools of
13:48 - coding
13:49 - and so i've always wanted to be able to
13:51 - help
13:53 - provide the coding trained audience with
13:54 - some information about live coding and
13:56 - so
13:56 - i'm really thrilled that antonio is here
13:58 - to do that so antonio roberts is an
14:00 - artist and create a curator based in
14:02 - birmingham uk he's coming all the way
14:03 - from the uk
14:04 - uh today uh working primarily with video
14:07 - code and sound he is critically engaged
14:09 - with the themes surrounding network
14:10 - culture
14:11 - and in his practice explores how
14:12 - technology continues to shape
14:14 - ideas of creation ownership and
14:16 - authorship as a performing visual artist
14:18 - and musician he utilizes live coding
14:20 - techniques
14:21 - to demystify technology and reveal its
14:23 - design decisions
14:24 - limitations and creative potential so
14:26 - andonia has shown
14:28 - at many galleries and festivals all of
14:29 - which are listed in the video's
14:31 - description
14:31 - he's curated a lot of exhibitions and
14:33 - projects also listed in this exhibition
14:36 - but i would encourage you there's links
14:38 - to his website instagram twitter
14:40 - youtube vimeo soundcloud and github all
14:43 - also in the video subscription so you
14:45 - can check out um
14:46 - all of those so i'm gonna awkwardly now
14:49 - attempt
14:50 - to transition over to antonio um
14:54 - you know i'm i'm i'm i'm getting better
14:56 - at this every single
14:58 - time in terms of like figuring out all
14:59 - of the logistics like technology for
15:01 - live streaming
15:02 - but in case there's an audio glitch of
15:04 - antonio's muted or i pressed the wrong
15:06 - button to play the wrong video at the
15:08 - wrong time
15:09 - you know blame me please send your vent
15:11 - your frustrations to i should set up
15:13 - like complaints at thecodingtrain.com
15:14 - it's not an email that exists yet but
15:16 - right after today i will set that up
15:17 - so first i'm gonna um antonio you're
15:19 - about to appear let me actually just i'm
15:21 - gonna unmute antonio say hello
15:23 - hello so hopefully everybody just heard
15:25 - antonio's voice
15:27 - i am now moving over to you're seeing
15:29 - antonio's slides here
15:31 - and i'm going to click this button which
15:33 - should bring up his video
15:35 - he's waving i'm going to make that a
15:36 - little bit larger and i'm also
15:38 - going to um uh turn
15:41 - on the uh live captioning that i have
15:44 - here hooked up through
15:45 - um zoom system so we have some live
15:48 - captions for antonio's
15:49 - um presentation there are also live
15:51 - captions through uh youtube itself but
15:53 - um
15:54 - i find that these um captions are a
15:55 - little bit higher quality okay
15:57 - uh hi antonia how are you how did i do
15:59 - with my introduction
16:01 - that was great thank you this is uh it's
16:03 - always weird hearing my own biography
16:05 - set back at me i'm like did i do all
16:07 - those things
16:08 - um yeah i'm doing great and it's really
16:12 - an honor to be here and yeah i'm looking
16:15 - forward to talking
16:16 - to you at you at the internet and seeing
16:19 - what happens
16:19 - wonderful so um the next step for this
16:22 - is i'm going to
16:22 - make myself disappear in the bottom left
16:24 - corner here and mute my audio
16:26 - um and let you take it away i just want
16:28 - to say to the audience that we will have
16:30 - a little time like maybe 10 to 15
16:32 - minutes
16:32 - for q a after if you want to write your
16:36 - questions
16:36 - in the chat i am going to i have a
16:39 - little notebook here
16:40 - and a pencil if you can if you if you
16:42 - know about this kind of fancy technology
16:44 - i'm going to try to make a note of um
16:46 - some of the
16:47 - questions i see that psy coding train
16:50 - community manager is also in the chat
16:52 - and so let me just click a little button
16:55 - here to add moderator
16:56 - um so psy and other coding train um
16:59 - discord members
17:00 - can help uh collect any questions and
17:02 - repost those um in the live
17:04 - chat and i'll come back and ask those at
17:05 - the end so
17:07 - um i think we could get started take it
17:10 - away antonio
17:12 - yay brilliant thanks very much for all
17:14 - that hey
17:15 - all right so um where do i start so
17:18 - today and so firstly my name as said is
17:21 - antonia roberts and
17:23 - i'm an also an artist and curator i'm in
17:25 - the uk in
17:26 - a city called birmingham and i do a lot
17:28 - of things within my practice
17:30 - um you've heard that long list but today
17:33 - really i want to focus on how
17:34 - artists and musicians are using
17:36 - programming to make
17:38 - art and music and through live coding
17:41 - so firstly just a little bit about who i
17:43 - am myself
17:45 - if you want to go check out my work
17:46 - here's my website hellocatfood.com uh
17:49 - because i like cats and you can i
17:52 - occasionally write blog posts about my
17:54 - work uh tutorials and all of that stuff
17:57 - so
17:57 - please do check that out so for the last
17:59 - 10 or so
18:00 - years i've been making primarily digital
18:02 - video artworks
18:04 - and that look a little bit like this
18:06 - these are some screenshots from them
18:08 - and these are exhibited and in places
18:10 - like galleries they're
18:12 - streamed online they're projected on to
18:14 - the size of buildings occasionally
18:17 - and and the way that i make all of these
18:19 - artworks are
18:20 - using mostly open source tools and tools
18:22 - that you might
18:23 - expect from a digital artist so your 3d
18:26 - modeling software
18:27 - video editors and image editors
18:31 - and what have you but um one thing that
18:34 - i do which a i guess a grown number of
18:36 - people are doing
18:37 - especially those who are watching this
18:38 - channel is i'm
18:40 - using um programming to make my artwork
18:44 - so um this here is the screenshot of
18:46 - some code that i
18:47 - wrote in a programming language called
18:49 - image magic and this
18:51 - this is available on my github by the
18:53 - way and this particular
18:55 - piece of this particular script um makes
18:59 - very nice kind of glitchy patterns based
19:02 - on jpeg compression
19:03 - and they look a bit like this and when
19:06 - you run the script each time it
19:08 - generates a new static image file that
19:11 - looks a bit glitchy like this
19:12 - and when you run it the output of it is
19:15 - um like a still image
19:16 - but depending on how you set it up you
19:18 - can also like see
19:20 - and the image being made like through
19:23 - all the silver images and it looks a
19:24 - little bit like this
19:26 - so you can see like it gets glitchier
19:28 - and glitchier
19:29 - so you know and that's just a very small
19:32 - um
19:33 - script without comments it's probably
19:35 - only like 30 lines
19:37 - um when i wrote this many years ago um
19:40 - another small script which i
19:42 - um you have made recently in fact was
19:45 - this script
19:46 - to basically make wavy glitchy looking
19:49 - gifs
19:49 - so if you every time you run it it
19:52 - generates a random
19:53 - wavy looking gif um which i pretty much
19:56 - like
19:57 - um and you know these um scripts
20:01 - they have several uses sometimes
20:04 - the programming that i use in my artwork
20:07 - is the artwork in itself
20:08 - so the results of it are exhibited just
20:11 - from whatever the program
20:12 - may uh makes or sometimes um
20:16 - the these images these gifs are used as
20:19 - like part of a wider larger piece
20:21 - um but yeah so yeah that's kind of like
20:24 - what i do my work
20:25 - there but i also have a performative
20:28 - practice i am a live performer
20:30 - and what i'm doing which is where the
20:33 - live coding comes into it is that
20:34 - um i'm using programming live on stage
20:38 - to make artwork
20:40 - in a process called surprisingly
20:43 - live coding and we do just live coding
20:46 - primarily at events called algorithes so
20:50 - what's an algorithm well the algorithm
20:53 - name the word is a portmanteau a
20:56 - combination of two different words
20:58 - algorithm and rave put them together you
21:00 - get algorithm and
21:02 - algorithms are parties where people uh
21:05 - dance to music and visuals primarily
21:08 - made with
21:09 - algorithms programming and uh yeah they
21:12 - they look a little bit like this so
21:13 - here's a few pictures
21:14 - of people performing uh with their
21:18 - laptops
21:19 - um at different events these are mostly
21:22 - ones around the uk
21:23 - because that's where i'm i live that's
21:25 - where i'm based
21:28 - so yeah just these are a few pictures
21:29 - i'll explain a little bit what's
21:31 - happening
21:31 - in some of these as well uh as we get
21:33 - forward but first just wanna
21:35 - show you what they what's happening uh
21:37 - so yeah that's what they look like are
21:39 - still pictures but maybe you wanna see
21:40 - uh what they look like and maybe you
21:42 - wanna see and hear what one of them
21:44 - sounds like
21:44 - so maybe we could have the first video
21:46 - which is a video of
21:48 - uh the uh an algorithm that happened at
21:50 - the british library
21:51 - in the uk
22:00 - [Music]
22:27 - cool so that and in that video you saw
22:29 - myself and my friend sean carter all
22:31 - performing
22:32 - in a library which you know there's
22:33 - another place to do but there you go
22:35 - that's what happens uh the next video is
22:37 - an example of a live stream
22:39 - featuring lizzie who i think is in the
22:41 - chat so lizzy goes by the name digital
22:43 - cell so we'll see a
22:44 - live stream of her now
22:58 - [Music]
23:09 - um the next video um i'll show you is a
23:12 - performance by
23:13 - myself and a collaborator mario vitek we
23:16 - perform under the name bad circulation
23:18 - and this performance is from iclc
23:21 - conference happened two years ago
23:56 - cool and uh the next video is from
23:58 - alfalfa i hope i pronounced that right
24:00 - he's a
24:00 - paris-based musician and this is another
24:03 - example of
24:04 - a live stream
24:43 - and for the last video i want to show
24:46 - you a video of alex mclean
24:48 - and matthew matthew yee king performing
24:51 - under the name knute
25:01 - [Music]
25:34 - cool thanks for showing those videos for
25:36 - controlling that then
25:38 - um so hopefully from all those videos
25:39 - you saw that like there's a range of
25:41 - things that can be done with
25:42 - algorithms we definitely have a lot of
25:44 - live streams happening
25:45 - um for many years uh you see people
25:48 - collaborating with people using
25:50 - different instruments different
25:51 - hardware technology and so it's quite a
25:53 - versatile practice
25:54 - and incorporates many different things
25:57 - um
25:58 - so as i've mentioned there have been a
26:00 - lot of algorithms all over the world
26:01 - of course i'm based in the uk so those
26:03 - are the ones i know most but um
26:05 - just wanted to share with you a few
26:06 - posters from
26:07 - [Music]
26:08 - ones that happen in different places so
26:10 - you have here
26:11 - excuse me on the left we performed at
26:15 - south by southwest a couple of years ago
26:17 - um and then on the right there's a very
26:20 - um vibrant live coding scene in new york
26:23 - city
26:24 - uh so this is a person with one of their
26:25 - events uh again on the left
26:27 - here's an event that happened in
26:29 - birmingham in the uk which i organized
26:32 - and on the right a another recent live
26:34 - stream which had all of these artists
26:36 - we've actually done many live streams
26:37 - recently where sometimes it lasted a
26:39 - week long
26:40 - and you know you can you can have 24
26:42 - hours of live coding
26:43 - seven days a week it's great and on the
26:46 - left again
26:47 - we have another live stream which
26:48 - happened on a cyber yacht
26:50 - uh yep yachts exist in cyberspace uh
26:53 - and on the right so you know you can see
26:56 - the date of this
26:57 - algorithm was actually 2015. so this is
26:59 - you know
27:00 - we've been partying for a while now um
27:03 - and then the last set of processes i'll
27:06 - show you an event that happened on the
27:07 - in new york
27:08 - on the left and a big festival that
27:11 - happened
27:12 - in sheffield in the uk uh on variety
27:15 - so yeah we we have performed all over
27:18 - the place and places that i haven't even
27:20 - mentioned here
27:22 - um so cable so you hopefully you've now
27:25 - kind of got a bit of an idea of what an
27:26 - algorithm looks like
27:28 - what it sounds like um but i just want
27:31 - to talk a little bit more about what
27:32 - happens at an algorithm and a very
27:34 - important part
27:35 - of um algorithms is
27:38 - to share your screen is to show
27:42 - what it is you're doing and so and this
27:44 - is usually done as you can see here like
27:46 - for a projector you can see and the code
27:48 - that the person is writing
27:49 - being projected behind them or somewhere
27:51 - else in the room and i think doing this
27:54 - has
27:54 - three effects and three important things
27:57 - that happen that kind of affects the
27:58 - performance and potentially the audience
28:00 - i think firstly showing the code helps
28:03 - to build a connection with the audience
28:05 - that's watching
28:06 - so um if you think back for example if
28:08 - you've ever seen gone to
28:10 - a a concert where there's a an
28:12 - electronic musician performing using
28:14 - a laptop right so they're on the stage
28:17 - with a laptop and really all you can see
28:19 - is like the back of their laptop and you
28:21 - know
28:22 - don't get me wrong when people are
28:23 - performing when electronic musicians are
28:25 - performing with like
28:26 - midi controllers with their laptops and
28:28 - so on there's definitely a skill to that
28:30 - that's like something that takes
28:31 - years of training to to perfect and so
28:34 - you know those musicians deserve respect
28:36 - but it's unfortunate that as you you as
28:39 - an audience member can't really
28:40 - appreciate and appreciate what they're
28:42 - doing because you know it's behind the
28:44 - laptop it's behind the screen
28:45 - and so some of that connection is lost a
28:48 - little bit
28:49 - if you compare it to say like percussive
28:51 - instruments like a drum or if you
28:53 - think of a guitar as well even if you
28:55 - don't understand
28:57 - how to play guitar or how to play drums
28:59 - at least
29:00 - when you see um you know the drummer hit
29:03 - the drum or the guitar strum
29:05 - you can see that in in them manipulating
29:07 - their instrument and then playing it
29:09 - differently
29:09 - different sounds occur so you you build
29:12 - that sort of connection
29:14 - to what's happening and um
29:18 - by showing the code even if you don't
29:21 - understand
29:22 - the code you know not everyone here is a
29:23 - programmer at least when you see
29:25 - a person writing some code you can see
29:27 - like other changed
29:28 - uh the instrument from like a bass drum
29:30 - to a
29:32 - an electronic drum or something at least
29:33 - when you see the code changing you can
29:36 - go
29:36 - you can also hear what's happening at
29:38 - the same time so it helps to build
29:40 - sources like that
29:41 - um relationship with the audience and
29:44 - show
29:44 - and show exactly what's happening behind
29:46 - the computer
29:47 - so the second effect that it does um
29:50 - is more like i guess a social commentary
29:53 - i don't believe that i
29:54 - like what i think and it helps to
29:56 - demystify how computers
29:58 - are working or at least demystify how
30:00 - art and music are made of computers
30:02 - if you look in the popular media today
30:05 - or you know over the last several years
30:07 - especially when it comes to things like
30:09 - artificial intelligence
30:11 - and machine learning there's there's
30:13 - always there's always this like kind of
30:14 - um
30:15 - idea that uh rogue our rooms are gonna
30:18 - take over the world and it's gonna be
30:19 - like terminated too
30:21 - and you know it's gonna gonna take over
30:23 - um and
30:24 - you know but that kind of thinking i
30:26 - think kind of forget
30:28 - it it forgets that behind all of this
30:31 - computing
30:32 - there's a human there's a human that
30:34 - made it and there's a human that
30:36 - understands how it's working and
30:40 - we can we if we're able if we're able to
30:42 - like you know rip apart the black box of
30:44 - the computer
30:45 - if we can understand it as well and so
30:48 - you know
30:49 - and by again with algorithms and live
30:52 - coding
30:52 - through showing this codes through
30:54 - showing how
30:56 - um a performance unfolds and changes
30:59 - we can hopefully learn that you know
31:00 - these computers that we have that we own
31:03 - are things which we can understand
31:06 - they are living up where they are within
31:08 - our comprehension
31:10 - yeah so and with that actually so with
31:13 - it being within your comprehension you
31:15 - probably now
31:16 - want to learn a little bit about what
31:18 - light of what
31:19 - where to learn live coding what tools do
31:21 - you have what what what tools am i using
31:23 - what tools are other people using
31:26 - so you could you could uh go on the
31:28 - internet and look for this there's and
31:29 - what you
31:30 - might find is a really massive long list
31:33 - of different software so this is just
31:34 - one screenshot from
31:36 - the awesome live coding uh github page
31:39 - which lists
31:40 - um a lot of different live coding
31:42 - languages ones for
31:44 - um you know all different operating
31:46 - systems down from the web
31:48 - and yeah they come in various flavors
31:50 - you might be a person who likes python
31:52 - you might be
31:53 - doing haskell c plus plus javascript you
31:55 - know there's going to be
31:56 - um most of these software are open
31:59 - source as well so
32:00 - um yeah most of them are
32:03 - and um yeah so no matter what kind of
32:06 - programming language you're familiar
32:07 - with
32:08 - there's probably gonna be a live coding
32:11 - language for
32:12 - visuals or music just to suit your
32:14 - tastes
32:15 - um but yeah you this list as i said this
32:19 - is only a screenshot of the list so
32:21 - you'll see like i don't know how it is
32:22 - on there but i'm going to say around 50.
32:24 - um so i've got i've picked out um and
32:27 - made of
32:28 - some videos showing uh some of the live
32:31 - coding
32:31 - tools which i've come across over my
32:33 - like five years of live coding
32:35 - so i think the ones that i'll show first
32:37 - will be music focused um
32:39 - live coding tools so i guess yeah could
32:41 - we have the first one which should be
32:42 - tidal cycles video please
32:57 - [Music]
33:17 - cool so so that programming language
33:19 - that you saw there at least with the
33:21 - blue text
33:22 - that's a programming language called
33:23 - tidal cycles which is created by axel
33:25 - mclean
33:26 - who's also the guy who i'm calling the
33:28 - term algorithm
33:29 - and it's a programming language based in
33:32 - haskell for
33:33 - um kind of it's for programming patterns
33:35 - of music
33:36 - he does a better explanation of it than
33:39 - i do
33:40 - and you also saw me vera actually as
33:42 - well that was a um
33:43 - recording from a performance that we did
33:45 - last year um but yeah so the main text
33:48 - the blue text was tidal cycles so that's
33:50 - one programming language which
33:51 - you might see quite a lot of the next
33:53 - programming language
33:54 - is quite different actually in how it
33:56 - operates and this one is called orca
33:58 - and it's made by a group called hundred
34:01 - rabbits so if
34:02 - orca please
34:15 - [Music]
34:21 - [Music]
34:32 - so
34:37 - great so yeah that that one is quite
34:39 - different in how it operates and
34:41 - it can produce some awesome things so
34:43 - yeah please check out orca if you
34:46 - want to learn a completely different way
34:47 - and the language of making
34:49 - uh life coding music so the last one
34:53 - which i'll show you at least for the
34:54 - audio side of things
34:55 - is a programming language called
34:57 - supercollider and this programming
34:58 - language dates back to i think 1996
35:01 - and it's used by quite a lot of people
35:03 - and it's more based around i think c
35:06 - plus plus or maybe it's just c so in
35:09 - this video you're going to see
35:10 - a musician called shelly knots from a
35:12 - performance demonstrating how
35:14 - it works so if you could have sheddy not
35:16 - playing superglider please
35:30 - [Music]
35:47 - [Music]
35:59 - cool so yeah so that's super collider um
36:03 - which is used actually in quite a lot of
36:05 - different software so like tidal cycles
36:06 - uses it for example as it's like
36:08 - sound engine but yeah um so if
36:11 - if you fancy yourself to be a c
36:13 - programmer
36:14 - don't wanna wanna learn that then yeah
36:17 - so
36:17 - please do so these are only just three
36:20 - of the um
36:21 - audio live coding software that's
36:24 - available there's
36:24 - so much more but i want to move on to
36:27 - showing you
36:28 - some of the visual side of things so i
36:31 - primarily
36:32 - when i've been at live coding events
36:33 - i've been making visuals
36:35 - um i've only recently like last two
36:37 - three years moved into music
36:39 - but yeah there's also just as much live
36:40 - coding software for visuals
36:43 - and uh yeah so australia's movement uh
36:45 - the first one i want to show you is
36:46 - um a piece of software called hydra and
36:49 - this is made by
36:50 - olivia jack so if you could have hydro
36:52 - please
36:57 - oh sorry yeah before you go to that
36:58 - video i just want to say um
37:00 - there is audio in these videos but the
37:02 - audio wasn't made by the software but i
37:05 - just put the audio in to kind of like
37:07 - help the demonstration so yeah here we
37:09 - have hydra by olivia jack
37:34 - foreign
37:36 - thank you for that and uh what i really
37:38 - like about hydra is that it's very
37:40 - like textural kind of video synthesis
37:44 - almost reminds me a lot of like hardware
37:46 - video synthesizers
37:47 - so and that um yeah that's browser-based
37:50 - but you can also download
37:58 - which you can use for both audio and for
38:00 - visuals and software called pure data
38:02 - i use it primarily for my visuals
38:05 - because and some of my music because
38:07 - it's how i like to work
38:08 - if you if you ever use something like
38:10 - max msp the interface will be familiar
38:12 - to you
38:13 - but um yeah so let's have pure data then
38:15 - next please
38:18 - [Music]
38:41 - cool so yeah pure data i i like how
38:43 - chaotic it all looks um
38:45 - it works like my brain works so it's all
38:48 - quite messy
38:49 - but um yeah so i use pure data
38:52 - and then the last one i want to show you
38:54 - is software called
38:56 - improvise written by a friend of mine
38:58 - guy john
38:59 - and yeah this one it's the syntax is
39:01 - based a little bit on um
39:03 - or it's similar to processing um if you
39:05 - ever use that
39:07 - um but you know it's it's good it's a
39:09 - good piece of software so yeah that's
39:10 - how we improvise then please
39:38 - so those are just um in fact that's why
39:40 - i just say that code um that came from a
39:42 - workshop that i did one of the
39:43 - participants made that code so i can't
39:45 - claim
39:46 - to have made about them coding myself
39:48 - but yeah
39:49 - so hopefully from from that those three
39:51 - videos you see that
39:53 - you know each one of them has sort of
39:54 - like a very different approach to
39:57 - coding the visuals and even the ones
39:59 - before that you know the different
40:00 - approaches to coding music so
40:02 - you know there's something for everyone
40:04 - hopefully um
40:05 - whether that's browser-based
40:06 - desktop-based whether you want to like
40:08 - just create
40:09 - noise or something rhythmic or something
40:12 - structure
40:13 - structured there's going to be things so
40:16 - now you've seen what algorithms look
40:18 - like you've seen what tools we're using
40:20 - um how we're using them where do you go
40:23 - to learn it
40:24 - okay so you've already seen that there's
40:25 - um this live coding
40:27 - them github list which is quite long
40:31 - i'd say um go on to the project
40:34 - websites a lot of them have good
40:37 - documentation
40:38 - and so you can you know learn about um
40:41 - how to how they work and even like learn
40:42 - about live coding as a practice
40:44 - through those websites but i'd say one
40:46 - good resource
40:47 - is going to be the top lap website so
40:49 - that's topblap.org
40:51 - and top lap is like a loosely held
40:53 - organization that just kind of promotes
40:55 - live coding and talks about it so if you
40:58 - go to this website there'll be links to
41:01 - the various different communities that
41:03 - are um
41:04 - that are talking about live coding
41:06 - whether that be local
41:07 - um regional whatever uh there will be
41:10 - research papers because you know this is
41:11 - something which uh
41:12 - academics are researching and talking
41:14 - about in that way
41:15 - so yeah research papers events all of
41:18 - that will be on the top website and
41:20 - that's like a good
41:21 - first start to then find um other people
41:25 - uh then well so that's just like an
41:27 - internet site
41:28 - but one thing you might want to do and
41:30 - especially like when we're actually
41:31 - allowed to kind of like meet people is
41:32 - see if there's any local groups in your
41:34 - area
41:35 - you know i'm based in birmingham in the
41:37 - uk and
41:38 - you know i often find myself traveling
41:40 - to visit other local groups
41:42 - and some of them so on the top website
41:45 - you'll see that in your forward slash
41:46 - nodes uh you know groups or nodes you'll
41:49 - see that there's um
41:51 - groups all over the world of course this
41:53 - presentation has
41:54 - largely had a uk bias because that's
41:56 - where i am but you know have a look at
41:58 - this list already like there's been
41:59 - there there's or there's a live coding
42:01 - groups berlin bogota
42:03 - there's uh north mexico montreal
42:06 - um yorkshire um yeah so wherever you
42:10 - um there might and it might just be a
42:12 - few people it might be a whole group
42:14 - have a whole building
42:15 - but you know go look and see if there's
42:19 - other people who are just um
42:21 - who have the same interest where and
42:23 - hopefully
42:24 - that'll be a better way to learn from
42:25 - you because i find
42:27 - personally myself i learn better when
42:29 - i'm with other people
42:30 - um and also you might want to do is look
42:34 - for workshops
42:34 - especially again once we're able to meet
42:36 - in person but also online
42:38 - i've run plenty of workshops in how to
42:41 - do live coding of visuals
42:43 - friends of mine have done live coding
42:45 - music workshops online and in person
42:48 - and you know they and the people who
42:50 - make the software are often
42:51 - also delivering these workshops and
42:54 - pers and so and they always try and make
42:56 - it as approachable and friendly as
42:58 - possible
42:58 - and working with different skill levels
43:01 - so like myself personally i've taught
43:03 - workshops to
43:04 - you know children as young as five like
43:06 - this photo here this is me
43:08 - and tate britain teaching live coding
43:11 - visuals to well yeah
43:12 - he had like a room full of like 20 kids
43:15 - it somehow worked
43:17 - but yes you know to talk to talk um
43:19 - children as young as that with
43:20 - with their parents and then of course as
43:23 - dan mentioned earlier i also taught
43:25 - taught live coding at coders of color
43:28 - and
43:29 - and i like i really appreciate the work
43:31 - that they're doing and sort of like
43:32 - helping the
43:33 - digital divide and introducing more
43:35 - people of color to
43:36 - programming and showing them that it's
43:38 - something that they can do
43:40 - and yeah so when i was there i taught
43:42 - them how to
43:44 - um do live visuals and demonstrated how
43:47 - um live coding music works
43:50 - and you know hopefully just made it a
43:52 - bit more approachable to show
43:54 - them one of the different creative uses
43:56 - of programming because of course you
43:57 - know
43:58 - as dan does you teach people to kind of
44:00 - get over that hurdle of
44:02 - it being incredibly difficult so yeah
44:04 - and codes of color i
44:05 - i fully support them in what they're
44:07 - doing
44:08 - and uh yeah and then i guess the the
44:10 - last way to
44:11 - and sorry if if all of this has been
44:14 - interesting to you has been of interest
44:16 - and i really hope it has
44:18 - go to an algorithm see if there's no
44:21 - grave happening
44:22 - of course in person they're not really
44:24 - happening just yet
44:25 - but we do live streams pretty much all
44:27 - the time in fact i'm actually performing
44:29 - in like two hours
44:30 - at an event which uh yeah i like to keep
44:33 - busy
44:33 - so you know we we're live streaming and
44:36 - performing
44:37 - all the time and we're always looking
44:38 - for new people to perform you know we
44:40 - we like to break down these hierarchies
44:42 - so like there's not really like just
44:44 - kind of like pro
44:45 - level of um live coders we're all just
44:47 - people
44:48 - really messing around with code and
44:50 - making some some weird music and some
44:53 - weird visuals
44:54 - so yeah and i'm gonna stop
44:57 - there and basically say you know thank
44:59 - you for listening to all that i've been
45:00 - saying
45:01 - and if you want to check out my work
45:02 - these are my links and to check out what
45:05 - i do
45:06 - how i make it occasionally i post
45:07 - tutorials or just snippets of what it is
45:09 - i'm making
45:11 - but again just get involved with the
45:12 - community of people um
45:14 - and hopefully see you on the dance floor
45:19 - uh yeah so if you want to as well stick
45:21 - around
45:22 - till um well in a moment i'll be showing
45:25 - you
45:26 - sharing a video that i made uh
45:28 - performance live coding performance i
45:30 - made
45:31 - specifically for this event and just to
45:33 - say
45:34 - about them i i used tidal cycles for the
45:37 - music and i used pure data for the
45:39 - visuals i wasn't doing both at the same
45:41 - time by the way
45:42 - i don't have like i'm not that good but
45:44 - i stitch it together afterwards so yeah
45:46 - um
45:47 - stick around to watch the video it's
45:48 - about 10 minutes long
45:50 - and i'll be i can be here for questions
45:52 - afterwards but yeah
45:53 - thanks for listening watching and i also
45:56 - try and jump in the chat thanks
45:57 - yeah thank you so much antonio so don't
46:00 - don't leave like this might seem like
46:01 - we're wrapping up but actually we
46:03 - we're saving the best part for right now
46:05 - well all that was terrific it's all
46:06 - equally wonderful
46:08 - but i'm very excited um you know um
46:10 - antonio obviously does this
46:12 - live and i would love to find out the
46:14 - information maybe we can share it about
46:15 - where you're performing in a couple
46:16 - hours
46:17 - of people who want more can tune in but
46:19 - based on the way that i have my setup
46:21 - here it i think would be give you a
46:22 - higher quality experience we had antonio
46:24 - sort of record a performance especially
46:27 - just for this
46:28 - coding train live stream and i'm gonna
46:30 - press a button in open broadcast studio
46:31 - which will play back that
46:33 - recording for you so i've taken like a
46:34 - couple questions down but
46:36 - i mean please just sit back and enjoy
46:38 - the performance but also now's a great
46:40 - time if you have a question or two you
46:42 - want to ask you can pop it into the chat
46:43 - i'll be keeping an eye on that and we'll
46:45 - have just a short you know 10 or
46:47 - 10 minute or so q a with antonio
46:50 - afterwards as well as information for
46:53 - you how you can watch the performance
46:54 - hopefully later today
46:55 - okay so i'm going to um as soon as i
46:58 - press this button it's off and running
47:00 - it's about a 10 minute performance enjoy
47:02 - and we'll circle back afterwards
47:06 - sorry i'm finding the button i found it
47:08 - here it comes
48:18 - me
48:46 - so
49:14 - so
49:28 - so
49:42 - great
49:56 - so
50:27 - [Music]
50:36 - [Music]
50:59 - [Music]
51:12 - [Music]
51:23 - [Music]
51:34 - so
51:37 - [Music]
52:12 - [Music]
52:58 - do
53:00 - [Music]
53:40 - so
53:43 - [Music]
54:10 - [Music]
54:26 - [Music]
54:39 - [Music]
54:50 - so
54:53 - [Music]
55:41 - [Music]
56:37 - [Music]
56:54 - all right i think we are back
56:58 - thank you so much for that wonderful uh
57:00 - performance
57:01 - it's interesting i experienced it all
57:03 - silently because the way i have my setup
57:05 - here
57:05 - i don't have i'm not monitoring the
57:07 - audio so i can't wait to go back
57:09 - and watch it uh later uh with the actual
57:12 - audio to get a sense of how that fits in
57:14 - and just to let everyone know
57:16 - um you know that antonio is posting that
57:20 - video
57:20 - itself as a separate standalone upload
57:22 - and we'll put a link to it in the chat
57:25 - and um uh in the video description or in
57:28 - the comment all the places where things
57:30 - would go along
57:30 - this video you'll find a link to that if
57:32 - you're looking for it oh this is so nice
57:34 - i see so many hand-clapping emojis in
57:36 - the chat
57:36 - because the chat is like 30 seconds
57:38 - behind me so i'm saying that i'm going
57:40 - to give my own
57:40 - uh oh and i can i can do a like a zoom
57:43 - uh
57:44 - hand clap reaction that's i don't know
57:46 - it didn't show up anywhere
57:47 - okay um so um thank you everybody for
57:50 - all the nice comments in the chat thank
57:52 - you so much for ant to antonio for the
57:55 - uh presentation performance we have a
57:56 - little bit of time um we want to give
57:59 - antonio
57:59 - a little time to rest before his
58:01 - performance later and
58:03 - um uh i um i will um share a link
58:06 - to that as well in a moment but i
58:08 - collected some great questions during
58:09 - and thank you to the
58:10 - coding trained moderators and members of
58:12 - the discord who helped capture some of
58:13 - these questions
58:14 - um that i'd love to if you have a few
58:16 - minutes antonio ask some of them to you
58:19 - great okay so let's see where to start
58:22 - actually so i'm going to start with this
58:23 - question from
58:24 - kevin um which reads
58:27 - are you listening to the music as you
58:29 - code do you take the music as
58:31 - inspiration for the code
58:33 - or are they two standalone parts that
58:35 - come together as separate pieces
58:37 - cool yeah that's a good question um yeah
58:40 - i'm definitely listening to the music
58:41 - for inspiration uh you know i like
58:45 - being on stage with a musician you are
58:47 - responding to what they're doing
58:49 - and and when when the music is
58:52 - really fun thing and like big beats then
58:55 - you what you want that to be reflected
58:58 - in uh
58:58 - the visuals of course because i'm coding
59:01 - all of it in real time like there's a
59:03 - certain
59:04 - i can't respond that quickly sometimes
59:06 - to very sudden changes in music
59:08 - but because of the nature of algorithm
59:10 - in that algorithm music tends to build
59:11 - slowly over time
59:13 - it means i can build my visuals and
59:16 - react to them also quite sturdy over
59:18 - time as well but yeah definitely always
59:20 - listen to their music like even making
59:21 - this video as well like i
59:23 - made the music first and then i played
59:25 - the music back and build the visuals as
59:27 - i was listening and
59:28 - you know just you what you can see me
59:30 - coding
59:32 - frantically typing yeah there's actually
59:35 - a
59:36 - kind of related question about that too
59:37 - from stig which is just sort of about um
59:40 - the feedback loop have you ever thought
59:42 - of it as a feedback loop where the music
59:44 - is sort of affecting the visuals and
59:45 - then it sort of goes back to the music
59:46 - does that kind of structure ever uh
59:50 - emerge or self-regulate or is that um
59:53 - mostly the is that something you've ever
59:54 - considered or thought about
59:57 - yeah so there's definitely like some
59:58 - form of feedback loop because
60:00 - um just through like through familiarity
60:03 - with like
60:03 - when i'm performing with another person
60:05 - for example you know we just know each
60:07 - other
60:07 - after performing together for so long so
60:09 - like
60:10 - i know what they're doing they know what
60:12 - i'm doing so we're just feeding off each
60:14 - other
60:15 - in that way and of course you can on
60:18 - technical level
60:19 - as well send one person's code to
60:21 - another person's computer and have like
60:23 - those two things affecting each other i
60:25 - do i haven't done that that much
60:27 - because obviously it's kind of a complex
60:28 - setup but yeah you can totally on a
60:31 - so on a like kind of relational
60:32 - relationship level you can have feedback
60:34 - loops and then also on a
60:36 - on a technical sending date as usual you
60:39 - can do the same
60:40 - and i've done both right you know it's
60:42 - interesting to me to think about
60:44 - this whole discussion because live
60:45 - coding as a performance is not something
60:47 - i've ever done
60:49 - but on some level what i'm doing
60:51 - constantly on this youtube channel is
60:52 - live coding not as a performance not in
60:55 - real time with music and visuals but
60:57 - try to live code to teach an example or
60:59 - to work out a problem
61:00 - and i guess what's interesting to me
61:02 - about the sort of so-called creative
61:03 - coding and working with processing in p5
61:06 - is how unlike maybe in more traditional
61:09 - software development where
61:11 - as a programmer might be given a spec
61:13 - sheet and write software to sort of
61:14 - conform to that spec sheet
61:15 - so much of the practice of creative
61:18 - coding
61:19 - is kind of wandering and improvisation
61:21 - and so i guess i'm curious like to what
61:22 - extent do you
61:24 - rehearse or plan in advance and to what
61:26 - extent
61:27 - do you improvise and just let the live
61:30 - coding performance
61:30 - kind of take you wherever it may go
61:34 - oh it's a bit of both really so
61:37 - yeah so four performances like even this
61:39 - video like i
61:40 - this the the videos watch was based off
61:42 - of was based off a sketch that i made uh
61:45 - just over a year ago
61:47 - and so i knew i was going to do that but
61:49 - then that sketch was only like a
61:51 - 10-second loop so i had to kind of like
61:52 - improvise how to like build it in
61:54 - and then sometimes just like oh let me
61:56 - change the number let me just change one
61:58 - of these numbers and see what happens
62:00 - and i remember um alex mclean said this
62:02 - in the presentation that like
62:04 - if you make a mistake and when you
62:06 - change some of the code just let it play
62:08 - four times and then you've got a beat
62:11 - i really like that because it's just
62:12 - like okay just see where it takes you
62:14 - and just
62:15 - let it ride out for a bit and see if you
62:17 - like it so yeah um
62:19 - i think and i remember i've also
62:20 - compared it to kind of like
62:22 - um jazz as well at least you know free
62:24 - form jazz you have you or
62:26 - even if not just like in in different
62:28 - types of music you have
62:30 - you know your different scales of music
62:32 - and
62:33 - people will just improvise within that
62:35 - scale so
62:36 - definitely when i'm when i'm performing
62:38 - that there is a
62:40 - uh structure there is an idea and then
62:42 - i'm just kind of like improvising within
62:44 - the idea and seeing what happens
62:46 - and sometimes it's great sometimes it's
62:48 - noisy
62:49 - sometimes it's good noisy but hopefully
62:52 - people stick around to listen to it
62:53 - yeah i think just the way you're
62:55 - describing it and thinking about the
62:57 - practice of
62:58 - jazz music and what's required to sort
62:59 - of like learn to play jazz to practice
63:02 - for a concert and yet to still improvise
63:05 - um is is a really apt um kind of analogy
63:08 - there so that's
63:09 - great thank you for that um um looking
63:11 - through there's a lot of questions that
63:12 - uh that i might sort of like try to
63:14 - combine into one
63:16 - um which really i think all touch on i
63:19 - think the sort of theme of getting
63:21 - started with live coding
63:22 - so there's a question about like you
63:24 - know uh where to showcase
63:26 - um your creation so i would imagine like
63:29 - if i'm a new
63:30 - coder and i want to try live coding like
63:32 - where could i first do it
63:34 - uh try to do a performance as well as i
63:35 - mean you touched on quite a bit this in
63:37 - your presentation but there's some
63:38 - sort of questions about like oh what do
63:40 - you have any recommended tutorials for
63:41 - pure data or
63:42 - some of the other things that you're
63:43 - using so i guess that's i will
63:45 - kind of collect all those into one
63:47 - question which is
63:48 - uh and i guess i'm asking this because i
63:51 - have lots of answers to people are
63:53 - asking the question of where do i begin
63:54 - to learn coding which i think is
63:55 - different
63:56 - from where do i begin to learn
64:00 - the practice of live coding as
64:01 - performance or experiment with it in the
64:04 - same way like a
64:05 - stand-up comedian might go to some like
64:07 - you know comedy clubs to like try out a
64:09 - set and that kind of thing
64:12 - yeah so like you know one answer would
64:15 - be
64:15 - uh go on youtube but then
64:19 - as i think i alluded to it in in my
64:22 - presentation
64:23 - it's better to learn from other people
64:25 - so on the top black website topblock.org
64:28 - there's also a a chat thing it's not a
64:30 - discord but like this is a kind of like
64:32 - it's a bit like slack so that's
64:35 - chats.hoplap.org
64:36 - and in there there's like different sub
64:39 - forms for each of the different
64:40 - languages
64:41 - and people just kind of like talk and
64:43 - share like
64:44 - what they're doing and as i said people
64:48 - are very friendly
64:48 - a lot of the discussions have now moved
64:50 - on to like separate discord channels so
64:52 - from there you can find links to it
64:53 - because you know discord urls are really
64:55 - long
64:56 - but um you know so you can uh so i'll
64:58 - say
64:59 - you know the top laptop is just kind of
65:01 - like a good place to
65:02 - meet the other people and yeah just just
65:05 - the nature of
65:06 - live coding is that you have to share
65:09 - your code
65:10 - so if you see someone's code copy it
65:13 - paste it change it and see if you like
65:17 - it you know
65:17 - and and and that's that's really a good
65:19 - thing about it about the universe
65:20 - there's no kind of secrecy so one so
65:23 - once you
65:24 - and and and people will help you people
65:27 - if you ask questions people will
65:28 - help you they are quite funny just
65:30 - because again there's not that secrecy
65:31 - so yeah if you go into that black chat
65:34 - then
65:35 - from there you might be pointed into the
65:37 - direction of a particular forum for a
65:39 - particular piece of software
65:41 - but yeah and then just copy and paste
65:42 - some code and
65:44 - see what happens great yeah in a moment
65:47 - i'm gonna um
65:48 - kind of switch out of the zoom and go
65:50 - show some urls like of the performance
65:52 - that you're doing later today so maybe i
65:53 - can pull up the
65:54 - it's top lap like t-o-p-l-a-p
65:58 - yeah yeah so maybe we can pull that up
66:00 - and just look at it briefly
66:01 - um so oh and thank you to um soren who
66:04 - just posted a link to chat.toplap.org in
66:07 - the chat so people can check that out
66:08 - um so thanks everyone to the questions i
66:10 - guess i have a kind of like wrap up
66:12 - question which is uh
66:13 - to literally tie things a little bit
66:15 - back to the coding train i guess
66:16 - or like the stuff that i work on so i'm
66:18 - trying to think about
66:20 - um and i know that there was a comment i
66:22 - think from stig who sort of said you
66:23 - could you can make an argument that
66:25 - uh you know sort of going along with the
66:28 - sort of in the vein of like what i'm
66:29 - doing
66:30 - in sort of like live coding tutorials is
66:31 - also a performance and some to some
66:33 - extent
66:33 - but i guess i'm curious have you ever uh
66:36 - this was asked by one of the viewers um
66:38 - have you used p5 or processing
66:40 - and i guess though since those languages
66:42 - aren't really sort of like real-time
66:44 - coding environments it's more about
66:46 - write the code run the code edit run
66:49 - again
66:51 - you know have you ever used those tools
66:53 - and how did the
66:55 - i'm just trying to think about if you
66:56 - have any ideas about how to transition
66:59 - from some of the creative coding tools
67:00 - that i use and the viewers use
67:03 - into live coding i know you mentioned
67:05 - one like has a very similar kind of like
67:07 - syntax to processing
67:08 - i don't remember which one that was but
67:11 - yeah but that tool was uh there's uh
67:14 - it's called improvise
67:15 - right yeah so yeah i have to use
67:18 - processing i don't use it that much
67:20 - um not for any particular reason uh and
67:22 - when i do use i'm usually using it like
67:24 - kind of on the desktop for some of my
67:26 - graphic design stuff which you know
67:28 - goes into a pre-recorded video or
67:30 - something so
67:31 - yeah so so i haven't used it
67:34 - for live coding there is actually an
67:36 - artist called ted davis did
67:38 - has created like a p5 live coding
67:42 - yes we talked about this the other day
67:44 - yes that's right
67:45 - yes so you know that is possible to do
67:47 - that
67:48 - uh but then yeah certainly you i guess
67:51 - it's
67:52 - when it comes to like can you and the
67:53 - comment that you the person made about
67:55 - like
67:55 - everything as a performance yeah it's
67:58 - just like
67:59 - the the performative way of doing it
68:01 - like having being aware
68:03 - of there being an audience and that
68:05 - you're
68:06 - you know demonstrating your thing and
68:07 - you're doing it
68:09 - for whatever purpose so like you know of
68:10 - course you're doing it for the
68:11 - educational purpose
68:13 - i'm doing it to try and get everyone
68:14 - moving and dancing
68:16 - and it's just like um but then but then
68:19 - also yeah
68:20 - just just um being aware of it
68:23 - so then you're you're you're typing how
68:26 - you're doing it becomes more intentional
68:28 - so you might have seen in the video of
68:30 - my performance but there were times when
68:32 - i was just like
68:33 - not typing just letting it rest for a
68:36 - second
68:36 - so let's because you know i'm aware that
68:38 - people sort of
68:40 - absorb in the music for a second uh and
68:43 - so like i'm very intentional of what i'm
68:44 - doing
68:45 - um yeah so that's how
68:48 - so i think yeah that's why in some ways
68:52 - wonderful uh all right thank you for
68:54 - taking the time to answer a lot of these
68:56 - questions
68:57 - um i just want to so uh there's a
69:00 - comment in the chat saying praxis
69:01 - live i've never heard of that but might
69:03 - be of interest and i
69:05 - i have i am familiar with the p5 live
69:07 - but i got it just
69:08 - escaped me for a moment there so that's
69:10 - hopefully something that i can take a
69:11 - look at and maybe explore in a future
69:13 - video or a future live stream here so
69:16 - i'm going to switch in a moment we're
69:17 - wrapping up and i'm going to switch to
69:18 - show you some of the urls and especially
69:20 - if you're interested in catching
69:21 - um antonio's performance later but i
69:23 - just again want to highlight um if you
69:24 - have more questions or want to learn
69:26 - more
69:27 - about antonio's work we've got
69:29 - hellocatfood.com
69:31 - hello cat food on all the different
69:32 - social media twitter instagram and
69:34 - soundcloud
69:34 - so please feel free to engage and follow
69:36 - and all that stuff there
69:38 - um i'm not entirely sure what's gonna
