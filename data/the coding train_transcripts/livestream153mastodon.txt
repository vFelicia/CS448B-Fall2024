00:00 - [Music]
00:40 - i muted i muted of course okay I'm back
00:43 - ah else always happens to me
00:47 - I'm not muted anymore hello welcome to
00:50 - the coding train
00:51 - it is me Dan on a Monday I think it's
00:54 - Monday at least uh but I had this very
00:57 - spicy lunch this is what I was talking
01:00 - about a second ago before I realized I
01:01 - was muted and it's my head is like a
01:04 - little bit in the clouds right now yes I
01:07 - everybody in the chat is saying no audio
01:09 - but as soon as shortly you're gonna
01:11 - catch up to me I have I have something
01:13 - to say I'm very worried about this
01:18 - livestream today so if you happen to
01:21 - tune in on Friday you might recall that
01:23 - the streams froze the computer would
01:26 - freeze I had to restart a bunch of times
01:30 - and so I tried do a few things on the
01:35 - computer for example I it's not this
01:38 - computer by the way so this laptop here
01:41 - is not the machine that is the problem
01:43 - the machine that is the problem is how
01:46 - can I show this to you this is gonna be
01:50 - very awkward let's try this yes
01:56 - sure okay the machine that is the
02:00 - problem is this one on the floor over
02:06 - there it is affectionately known as it
02:10 - doesn't have an affectionate name it's a
02:11 - it's a Mac Pro you know it looks like a
02:13 - little trash can it has it has served me
02:16 - well over the years
02:19 - but recently it started to overheat I
02:23 - believe so I did something which is
02:26 - called to reset I didn't know about this
02:29 - thank you to us Austin reset Mac SMC so
02:36 - I tried to do this also this microphone
02:41 - is in like a weird place
02:44 - what's going wrong today so I tried to I
02:49 - did this I also upgraded the machine to
02:52 - Mojave because why not
02:54 - white some stuff off the machine and as
02:57 - you can see I am live streaming from
02:58 - that machine and it has not crashed yet
03:01 - but I wish I had pressed the button
03:03 - start streaming just like five minutes
03:05 - earlier because if the Machine started
03:07 - beeping so it does this weird beeping
03:10 - I've never heard I wish I have recorded
03:11 - this but sounds like this I have never
03:18 - heard a Mac computer do this before it
03:21 - does it and then it just stops and then
03:24 - I thought maybe then it would freeze I
03:26 - don't know so if anybody has any idea
03:28 - what that could possibly be please let
03:30 - me know I did install some monitoring
03:32 - stuff and for example it does say the
03:43 - [Music]
03:44 - CPU is currently 148 degrees that's I
03:49 - believe in Fahrenheit and we so tell me
03:53 - like a GPU temperature somewhere here
03:56 - system I don't all something I think
03:59 - some people recommend some other things
04:01 - that might even be better tivity monitor
04:03 - so I don't know
04:05 - we're gonna go Patrick and the chat
04:11 - rightz won't help if it's overheating
04:13 - it's likely a hardware issue dust I was
04:16 - hoping that maybe it was like an issue
04:18 - with the fan but like somehow like he
04:21 - didn't know how to turn the fan on and
04:22 - off properly and upgrading wouldn't fix
04:24 - that in my fantasies
04:26 - so anyway I'm here I am going to do this
04:32 - live stream today up until the moment
04:34 - the computer crashes if it does not
04:36 - crash great if it does crash I might
04:40 - come back just to say that the machine
04:42 - crashed but then I think if it does
04:44 - crash I'm going to spend the rest of my
04:45 - time trying to find a different computer
04:48 - today so I'm sorry to go on and on about
04:52 - this I keep looking over to see if I'm
04:55 - still live let me check the slack
04:57 - Channel
04:59 - [Music]
05:04 - and yeah alright so welcome to the
05:09 - coding train what you are about to watch
05:11 - today is a person me do some coding
05:15 - tutorials and today's topic will be
05:17 - [Music]
05:23 - decentralized social networks like
05:25 - mastodons and making a bot for them I
05:28 - kind of try to use the sound board again
05:31 - it's been a while alright so I'm gonna
05:32 - jump right into this I've got to situate
05:39 - myself here first which is to go to this
05:43 - youtube channel called the coding train
05:45 - go to playlists created playlists I
05:52 - think I'm looking for session six five
05:58 - four there we go
06:02 - this is not what I'm looking for it this
06:04 - is what I'm looking for okay setting up
06:08 - a Twitter alright so what I am going to
06:12 - do today is does the new machine have to
06:16 - be a Mac no it doesn't have to be a Mac
06:17 - it has to be a machine that I can use
06:21 - that will do all the things that I need
06:22 - notably take inputs from multiple
06:25 - cameras from the laptop HDMI out audio
06:29 - inputs and it will stream and run open
06:31 - broadcast studio that's all though the
06:33 - machine needs to do and you know so far
06:36 - it's kind of working
06:37 - ask Louis Rossman about the Mac stuff
06:40 - says Jason yeah okay alright so I'm
06:49 - gonna jump right in I'm gonna open up a
06:51 - few URLs join massan's what I'm looking
07:00 - for here
07:05 - this is the order and then I need one
07:08 - more or what I want activity pub and I
07:14 - also would like a mastodon on github
07:19 - which is here okay okay
07:27 - yeah marker I need to make sure the
07:31 - whiteboard camera is working which it is
07:40 - and we shall begin Josh is writing
07:49 - probably not enough RAM for streaming
07:51 - maybe you're not referring to this book
07:53 - oh yeah I see this computer has this
07:57 - computer is let me just give you all the
07:59 - specs here it is a 2000 late 2013 Mac
08:03 - Pro the processor is a 3.5 gigahertz six
08:07 - core intel xeon xeon e5 has 16 gigabytes
08:12 - of some sort of ddr3 1866 1866 megahertz
08:18 - ram its graphics card as an AMD FirePro
08:21 - d 500 3072 megabytes and I even have I
08:25 - even have right over here I'm going to
08:29 - show you something remarkable I thought
08:32 - would fix all my problems we should use
08:36 - this today though I have this Blackmagic
08:41 - Design EGP you this is an external GPU
08:45 - unfortunately it only takes Thunderbolt
08:47 - 3 which is not a thing apparently I can
08:53 - use with that Mac Pro from late 2013 but
08:57 - I thought maybe if I use an external GPU
08:59 - it would solve a lot of my problems all
09:03 - right ok
09:09 - welcome everyone
09:27 - [Music]
09:30 - hello this is a first video in a new
09:34 - series about making a mastodon bot and
09:37 - you might be asking yourself okay why
09:40 - are you making what is Mastodon why are
09:43 - you making a mastodon bot and why should
09:45 - I care I'm not sure why you should care
09:48 - but I'm gonna try to answer those other
09:49 - questions and you yourself can decide so
09:51 - this playlist is essentially a
09:54 - replacement for session for Twitter API
09:58 - and BOTS with nodejs so I am I'm gonna
10:01 - not redo fifteen point one and fifteen
10:04 - point two if you have never used node
10:05 - before or don't know what NPM is you can
10:08 - go back and watch those two videos but
10:10 - I'm gonna start here basically with
10:12 - setting up setting up a Twitter setting
10:14 - up a mastadon and so what is Mastodon
10:16 - why are we here so the Twitter API which
10:20 - I use to create these set of tutorials
10:21 - recently changed quite a bit so it is
10:24 - much harder to sign up for a new account
10:28 - authorized for automation making a bot
10:30 - that posts an automatic way to Twitter
10:33 - they also change something about the API
10:35 - called the streaming API the way you
10:37 - could connect to Twitter and listen for
10:39 - certain events they change the API that
10:41 - is no longer available so while I
10:44 - encourage you to still experiment with
10:46 - Twitter as a platform if you so like if
10:48 - today is your first day wanting to like
10:51 - learn some stuff about node and social
10:53 - networking and making a new social
10:54 - networks and making a bot that post
10:56 - Mastodon is going to be a more
10:57 - pleasurable easygoing experience for you
11:00 - that's going to allow you to express
11:01 - your creativity in a much more immediate
11:03 - way and then there's another reason it
11:05 - has to do with this idea called
11:06 - decentralization so Twitter notice it's
11:09 - kind of an awful place to be for the
11:11 - most part I don't want to get too far
11:13 - down that discussion but is there is
11:16 - there another way is there another way
11:18 - that we can communicate with each other
11:20 - in a less centralized government owned
11:23 - by large corporations kind of way and
11:25 - one way to do that is with a concept
11:28 - called decentralization and mastodons is
11:30 - an open-source I don't know maybe I
11:32 - should go somewhere where it actually
11:33 - says what it is well you can really
11:36 - follow friends discover new ones publish
11:38 - anything you want link pictures text
11:39 - video all in a platform
11:41 - at his community owned and ad-free no
11:42 - this is not like some sort of sponsored
11:44 - video I'm experimenting with this
11:45 - platform because it interests me and
11:49 - maybe it'll interest you it is an
11:51 - open-source project you can see it's on
11:53 - github here and the decentralization
11:55 - runs with a protocol called activity pub
11:58 - so let me try to give you an
11:59 - understanding of what I mean by all this
12:02 - stuff okay so what is Twitter ultimately
12:11 - did it just give me a second
12:15 - coughing fit here what is Twitter I
12:21 - don't know anyone should really answer
12:23 - that question but I will give you a
12:26 - little framework so Twitter is a company
12:30 - they run probably a lot of servers you
12:34 - can sign you can be sitting on your
12:37 - laptop or your you know phone that's a
12:40 - phone apparently and you can sign up for
12:42 - an account
12:43 - on Twitter you could give yourself a
12:45 - Twitter username like at Schiffman and
12:48 - then you could post messages like the
12:51 - heart emoji and you can read other
12:53 - messages that other people are sending
12:56 - into Twitter this is what you would
12:59 - refer to as a centralized platform the
13:04 - software that runs Twitter is on a
13:06 - particular server its proprietary the
13:09 - way Twitter is governed and how where
13:11 - what certain posts are allowed and
13:12 - aren't allowed are all run by the same
13:16 - company and all of your data all of the
13:19 - tweets you've ever posted all of your
13:20 - user information your password stuff all
13:22 - of that is stored on this centralized
13:25 - server the web in its origins if you go
13:27 - back and look at the history of the web
13:29 - didn't really start as this idea of a
13:32 - centralized platform the web didn't
13:39 - start with this idea of a centralized
13:42 - platform the idea was many different
13:44 - nodes all interconnected being able to
13:46 - share and publish with each other and so
13:49 - there is this is coming slowly entering
13:51 - the zeitgeist now this idea of decent
13:53 - last platforms probably if you're not
13:54 - familiar with that you're probably
13:55 - familiar with something called Bitcoin
13:57 - right which runs on something called
13:59 - blockchain which is a protocol for
14:01 - decentralized financial transactions
14:02 - which I'm not gonna make any videos
14:04 - about at least any time soon but
14:07 - mastodons is a D open-source
14:11 - decentralized social social network I'm
14:14 - not so much trouble saying that word do
14:23 - you like trains Mastodon Mastodon is an
14:28 - open-source decentralized social network
14:31 - and it probably resembles Twitter the
14:35 - most but there's some nuance to that so
14:37 - how is it different how does it work
14:38 - well number one is there is no single
14:41 - server for example I have actually set
14:43 - up my own server known as an instance
14:45 - and I'm not going to show you in this
14:48 - series how to set up your own mastodons
14:50 - in instance but if that's of interest I
14:52 - certainly can provide some resources to
14:54 - do that and I could do a video about
14:55 - setting one up my instance is at a
14:58 - particular domain Chuchu dot space this
15:04 - is my Mastodon instance so we'll call it
15:07 - choo-choo there are other Mastodon
15:10 - instances for example Mastodon dot
15:14 - social there is also Lily let me erase
15:18 - some of this stuff here chew chew
15:20 - Mastodon dot social
15:23 - there are some other ones that I have
15:25 - seen for example there is visit social
15:29 - which is an instance for people
15:31 - interested in data visualization I
15:32 - presume there is another instance called
15:35 - bots in dot space which I'm going to use
15:40 - in this series to make a bot that runs
15:41 - on this bot in space so the idea here is
15:44 - I've set up this instance let's say you
15:47 - want to sign up for an account with this
15:49 - particular instance you would go show it
15:50 - to your psyche you would go there and
15:51 - you would sign up into my username I'm a
15:55 - client my like picture of my like laptop
15:58 - over here which is strangely it's a
16:00 - weird bizarre angle I am Schiffman at
16:05 - choo-choo
16:06 - dot space so this is my local this is my
16:12 - local Mastodon instance when I want to
16:15 - sign on when I want to post something I
16:17 - post it I sign on through this server I
16:20 - post it through this server my account
16:22 - is with this server but there is this
16:24 - concept called Federation it sounds like
16:28 - something I'm Star Trek and it kind of
16:31 - is which Federation and I know I kind of
16:33 - getting close to writing off the top is
16:34 - a way for all of these instances to
16:38 - communicate with each other in a
16:39 - decentralized fashion so if I post
16:45 - something saying like hello I ate
16:48 - oatmeal for breakfast this morning this
16:52 - post that I make through here will get
16:54 - propagated throughout the entire network
16:56 - of mastodons instances so there is both
17:00 - when you're browsing Mastodon there's
17:02 - both this idea of a local time line as
17:04 - well as a federated or you can think of
17:07 - it as global time line and I'll show you
17:09 - this in a second I could browse and just
17:10 - look at all the posts I think they're
17:12 - called toots all the toots for people
17:16 - who are at this instance are all the
17:18 - toots from people all throughout the
17:20 - Federated universe of instances by the
17:22 - way the protocol that is used for all of
17:26 - this for that for all the communication
17:28 - to propagate throughout the network did
17:30 - I mention this already
17:31 - it's called activity pub so the software
17:36 - that runs a particular server is
17:38 - completely open source
17:39 - it took me a while to get it up and
17:40 - running but I have it up and running
17:42 - here so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
17:43 - to show you my account here I'm gonna
17:45 - show you bots in space which is an
17:47 - instance design for people who want to
17:49 - make BOTS I'm gonna sign up and create a
17:51 - bot on bots in space and interact with
17:53 - it here and then just show you how the
17:54 - global network of stuff works so the
17:58 - only prerequisites really for you going
18:01 - to the next video is to have node
18:03 - installed on your computer and you can
18:05 - go back and watch my two sort of intro
18:07 - to node for Twitter bots videos and the
18:09 - same concepts there will apply although
18:11 - I'm going to use different node packages
18:13 - what else do I want to say about this
18:18 - yeah okay coming back over here okay so
18:26 - so this is the github repository where
18:29 - is the open source Mastodon project is I
18:32 - encourage you to check that out this is
18:34 - some more information about activity pub
18:35 - which is the protocol for decentralized
18:38 - social networking lots of other services
18:40 - also use activity pub there being this
18:43 - idea of dee central the decentralized
18:45 - web is not limited to Mastodon one
18:46 - simple example of that and then here now
18:49 - you can see whoops
18:50 - here is my Mastodon instance you can see
18:54 - that if I go to choo-choo dot space I am
18:56 - there it looks like I am on some kind of
18:59 - social network thing where I can say hey
19:01 - I looks hey I am live on YouTube right
19:06 - now and I can you to make a little train
19:11 - and a little I know you're just gonna
19:13 - have to watch me do this I have to pick
19:15 - my emojis very carefully and
19:16 - thoughtfully rainbows like clouds or
19:19 - anything no I don't know okay that'll be
19:21 - enough I'm gonna post that you can see
19:23 - there it is
19:24 - and it is there on the local timeline so
19:26 - this is the local timeline UK weep on
19:29 - there look ma I'm on the live stream now
19:32 - here's the thing because my instance is
19:36 - something I just set up and it's running
19:38 - off of a digital ocean server I it's
19:40 - like ten dollars a month it's like two
19:42 - gigabytes of RAM I just signed up for it
19:43 - digital ocean ocean is a hosting
19:45 - provider not a sponsor but could be a
19:48 - digital ocean area listening I'm not the
19:51 - signups are not open so to get an invite
19:54 - code to sign up on the choo-choo space
19:56 - instance you can be if you're a member
19:59 - of the YouTube channel or a patron of
20:01 - the channel you can you can sign up
20:02 - there but I'm just you know I don't I
20:05 - don't want to mention it let me go back
20:09 - the machiya who will be watching this
20:12 - later I don't want to go on and on if I
20:13 - don't want to like mention the patron
20:15 - membership stuff during the that's
20:17 - important for the livestream context but
20:20 - because I might open it up later so let
20:22 - me just kind of Rhys a what I was saying
20:24 - before
20:31 - I'm afraid to go to the global time line
20:33 - but uh maybe I'll maybe I will let me
20:35 - just quickly peek ok it's not terrible
20:42 - okay go back was they saying you could
20:50 - see the I don't know I don't know where
20:53 - I was I'm just gonna do that whole
21:00 - little section again sorry for the live
21:06 - people who this will be annoying too
21:15 - okay so here we are and what I could do
21:17 - now is I guess first of all let me just
21:19 - show you a couple links which will all
21:20 - be in this video's description this is
21:23 - the github open source repository for
21:25 - the mastodons software that I'm running
21:27 - currently on my server over here I just
21:31 - I think I met this - oh I'm so confused
21:33 - did I show help me out for a second in
21:36 - the chat did I show these earlier like
21:40 - I'm confused cuz I tried to do this
21:41 - video last week and then I got messed up
21:43 - did I already earlier today show the
21:47 - github repository and this page and I'm
21:49 - not repeating myself like when I was
21:50 - doing my intro that I went to the
21:52 - whiteboard does anybody remember let me
21:56 - know in the slack channel or we're here
21:58 - oh I made that digitalocean joke if I
22:02 - might have to make that again cuz they
22:04 - could be a sponsor for real yes one of
22:08 - the first things okay alright so I'm
22:13 - just gonna like come over here to my
22:15 - instance whoops no no
22:22 - you showed activity huh but not the repo
22:25 - okay great thank you so I'm not gonna
22:27 - show activity hub again so I'll just
22:30 - come over here okay
22:32 - Oh welcome new member or nico thinker
22:35 - and gee and please the first thing you
22:38 - should do is tell me how to pronounce
22:39 - your name and you can go and check the
22:42 - community tab and there's a link there
22:45 - with an invite code to join this Macedon
22:46 - instance instance if you're so
22:48 - interested okay thank you everybody for
22:50 - the comments all right okay so now we're
22:55 - over here this is the join mastodon org
22:58 - website you can find out a lot of
22:59 - information I would encourage you to
23:01 - click on this how it works what is
23:03 - Mastodon video which is on YouTube which
23:05 - will explain all that much better than I
23:06 - did get started you could find an
23:09 - instance that you might like to join
23:11 - this is the github open source
23:13 - repository with the software that's
23:17 - running now and now here is my instance
23:22 - the choo-choo people are notifying me
23:26 - and saying hi and look k week Mon says
23:29 - look my I'm on the live stream okay
23:30 - excellent
23:31 - please use caution when posting now so
23:38 - this is what it looks like you can see
23:39 - it looks like some other social network
23:41 - service that you might sign up for the
23:43 - difference is I am actually running the
23:45 - software for it on my own server this
23:47 - server I happen to sign up through
23:48 - digitalocean which is a web hosting
23:50 - company that is not a sponsor it could
23:52 - be a sponsor hello did you lotion butt
23:56 - and you could set up your own and so
24:00 - what but here's what I'm gonna do it
24:02 - what you can look at other instances
24:04 - like bots in space this is the instance
24:06 - and you could sign up in the next video
24:07 - I'm actually gonna sign up for an
24:08 - account here so I can make a bot that
24:10 - post on it you can see here's some bots
24:13 - already that are posting things the
24:15 - cyber painting beard de Meyer in the
24:16 - North Pole inspired by Hubert Robert
24:18 - okay the sequel is here get ready for
24:21 - guards to define I don't know please
24:24 - have a tree picture this is a tree bot
24:26 - come on let's make a tree bot that's
24:28 - gonna be so nice so again these are
24:30 - things that you can do on other services
24:32 - but math
24:33 - on being open source it's a really
24:36 - friendly and easy place to get started
24:38 - with in terms of the API which I'm sure
24:40 - will drap idli change and who knows how
24:43 - quickly this video god of date but
24:44 - that's the current spot so if you want
24:47 - to sign up for an account before the
24:49 - next video I'm gonna do it in the next
24:50 - video I would recommend bots in space
24:53 - for a bot account and then you can also
24:55 - go I'm just gonna open a new incognito
24:56 - window actually you know what I don't
24:58 - have to this is one of the things that I
24:59 - like you can be logged in multiple
25:01 - mastodons accounts so if I go here get
25:03 - started I'm gonna you can see here are a
25:06 - whole bunch of servers so like for
25:08 - example I am a musician and I speak
25:12 - Deutsch then we can see here are some
25:15 - mastodon instances that i might want to
25:17 - sign up for so let's find one for the
25:19 - coding train besides choo choo dot space
25:22 - i am a game or developer shall we say
25:27 - developer I don't know I guess that's
25:30 - the closest I don't think I'm a
25:31 - developer and I speak English and we can
25:34 - see here are some here are some ones
25:38 - let's just cut that whole extra part
25:40 - here cuz I don't know what is going on
25:42 - [Laughter]
25:43 - okay thank you very much I mean so if
25:53 - you want to sign up for a mastodon
25:55 - account not on choo choo dot space or or
25:59 - bots in space a new one for yourself you
26:01 - can come you can go to join Mastodon org
26:03 - and you can go look here you can look
26:06 - for something like oh you're an artist
26:07 - yes and you speak English
26:11 - ova social there we go a social space
26:13 - for anyone in data visualization
26:14 - creative coding etc and now you can see
26:16 - this is visit social and you could sign
26:18 - up here now once again even if you sign
26:20 - up at a certain instance that's just
26:22 - your name and address and your local
26:24 - instance but through Federation through
26:26 - activity pub through decentralization
26:28 - you are still participating the broader
26:30 - world that is Macedon okay
26:33 - so what's gonna happen next in the next
26:35 - video I am going to sign up for a box in
26:37 - space account I'm going to show you how
26:39 - to get your API keys I'm gonna write a
26:41 - little note program that posts the toots
26:43 - to it automatically and and then I'm
26:45 - going to show you lots more what
26:47 - and things and how the API works and
26:48 - different ways to post images and
26:50 - replies and favorite things and all that
26:52 - kind of stuff okay so I hope you enjoyed
26:54 - this exploration of the open source
26:55 - project Mastodon and I look forward to
26:57 - hearing what you think in the comments
27:02 - Almer is writing his hair is darker than
27:05 - I remember is it my hair I got a haircut
27:07 - nobody noticed my haircut I went to a
27:10 - very nice barber shop over the weekend
27:11 - in Prospect Heights Brooklyn and I had a
27:16 - lovely experience with a lovely barber
27:20 - talked my ear off my ear is still on it
27:27 - was very nice ok any questions did that
27:38 - like for those of you who have never
27:40 - heard of Mastodon or decentralisation
27:42 - before today did you get something from
27:45 - that was that helpful interesting useful
27:47 - I can't believe this hasn't crashed yet
27:50 - I almost want it to crash because I want
27:52 - to just I feel like it's just on the
27:54 - edge of crashing all the time ok alright
28:04 - so let me let me get set up here for the
28:13 - next piece of this
28:22 - I have a lot more space I could work
28:24 - with here yeah so we're gonna go to Chu
28:28 - Chu dot space and box bots in dot space
28:33 - I think I can close these things out
28:43 - make that a little bit bigger make this
28:46 - a little bit bigger local time line
28:50 - there we go okay okay alright I think I
29:02 - am ready now to get started
29:13 - oh I need to have I turn and let's go to
29:25 - desktop make directory mr. Don but okay
29:32 - Oh another new member this is so nice of
29:36 - all of you under us year mati where are
29:41 - you from I wonder under das thank you
29:42 - for joining okay so so let me just for
29:46 - the live stream if you for anybody is
29:50 - watching right now if you go to
29:52 - choo-choo dot space you're gonna see
29:55 - this message sign up on another server
29:57 - registrations are reserved for coding
29:59 - train YouTube members and patrons I'm
30:01 - doing this not because I want to have a
30:03 - closed thing I mean might make sense for
30:05 - this to be a member benefits I don't
30:07 - know most I'm doing this cuz I just set
30:09 - the instance up and again it's on a
30:11 - digital ocean server I just picked a
30:13 - droplet in picked a five dollar month I
30:15 - picked up $10 a month so give me a
30:16 - little bit more juice but I I just I'm
30:20 - not sure about the sustainability of
30:21 - this and what's gonna cost so at the
30:24 - moment you can you can certainly
30:25 - participate and communicate on mastodons
30:27 - through the fact that it's decentralized
30:28 - but you want to sign up with a personal
30:30 - account somewhere else or join the
30:32 - YouTube channel and then you'll get an
30:35 - invite code and maybe I'll open this up
30:37 - later
30:37 - as well as an look we got 22 users so
30:41 - far and then as well as unboxing space
30:44 - which is open it's currently an open one
30:46 - you'll notice that the main one
30:48 - mastodons dot social for example also is
30:51 - registration on the server currently
30:53 - closed due to high demand please sign up
30:55 - on macedon dot cloud instead so i don't
30:58 - know you know i think that i think it's
31:02 - it what I'd like about mastodons is that
31:03 - they're these you know instances these
31:05 - little subgroups within the larger
31:06 - universe so I affinity groups maybe in a
31:09 - way so I do like the idea of opening up
31:11 - to Chuchu dot space but also you might
31:13 - find one that's you know you may be
31:15 - coding train is not your sole purpose in
31:17 - life and you might find a different
31:19 - space that's well suited to you okay
31:21 - which is him to say that's joining the
31:24 - anyway no okay
31:26 - all right okay people are really sending
31:30 - me crazy stuff right now how did you do
31:33 - that all right this is really funny
31:39 - what's going on so far I don't mind no I
31:43 - don't mind this at all in fact I'd
31:44 - rather enjoy it but please use
31:46 - discretion
31:47 - don't try to don't ruin my video with
31:50 - nonsense okay all right so hi thank you
31:55 - Marius for your nice comment okay so I'm
32:02 - back here I'm gonna go here okay okay
32:07 - we're back for another mastodons video
32:09 - and in this video I'm going to sign up
32:11 - for a bots in dot space account space I
32:16 - feel like I need some space music hold
32:18 - on this is gonna be totally worth it
32:22 - [Music]
32:33 - five seconds okay how come I can't hear
32:37 - that oh boy now I can go hear that and
32:44 - crazy feedback hold on you need to do is
32:49 - I need to mute this okay there we go
32:51 - all right sorry everybody okay
32:56 - hello welcome to the second master time
32:59 - video in the first video I talked a bit
33:00 - about what Mastodon is or least my
33:02 - impressions of it the idea of
33:03 - decentralization and in this video the
33:05 - reason why I'm doing this is I want to
33:07 - find a platform to write crazy weird
33:09 - experimental avant-garde art bots and so
33:13 - I'm gonna use this platform sounds that
33:22 - this was gonna be this guy's I just seem
33:24 - better when I thought it played with
33:25 - music and later now but so the first
33:27 - thing I'm gonna want to do is sign up
33:29 - for an account here with bots in space
33:31 - and I'm going to say sign up with coding
33:37 - trained BOTS and I am going to use the
33:40 - email address Daniel at the coding train
33:43 - comm I'm going to use the password
33:45 - suggested password I don't think I
33:47 - should use this because then you will
33:49 - all see it I'm gonna use the password I
33:51 - love blueberries or heart heart Rainbow
33:58 - sure you'll all be able to guess my
34:00 - password really easily what is what do
34:03 - you what does this nonsense go away a
34:05 - message with confirmation link has been
34:07 - sent to your email address a hold on a
34:09 - second
34:10 - talk amongst yourselves I am now going
34:14 - to attempt to I didn't get an email is
34:23 - in my spam it's not in my spam well I
34:31 - did get some private messages from some
34:33 - nice people in my spam okay I came
34:42 - through so my confirmation came through
34:44 - and
34:45 - so you can edit this stuff out I guess
34:47 - verify email address ah my email address
34:50 - has been verified
34:51 - okay I got the email I verified my email
34:54 - address I should be able to log in now
34:56 - coding terrain bot if I could remember
35:01 - what my password is I'll log in oh no
35:07 - this is not the password oh no wait oh I
35:11 - have to use my email
35:12 - then you'll oh great thanks for showing
35:15 - all my emails here auto-fill whatever
35:18 - you hold on okay so I click the verify
35:30 - my email I have now put in my username
35:33 - and password I'm gonna click login and
35:35 - now welcome to Mastodon I'm gonna save
35:38 - this just why not this is my full handle
35:40 - at coding train bot at BOTS in space I'm
35:44 - not gonna skip through this little
35:45 - tutorial here but first thing I'm gonna
35:48 - do very important is I'm gonna go to
35:49 - edit profile and I'm just gonna go down
35:51 - here night I would want to put other
35:52 - stuff here and maybe I'll do that
35:53 - eventually but I want to go here and I
35:55 - want to click this is a bot account
35:57 - because one of the nice things about
35:59 - Mastodon it has a feature for you to
36:01 - indicate that a particular account is a
36:03 - bot which is you know a really nice
36:04 - thing to do in terms of transparency
36:07 - okay the other thing that I want to do
36:09 - is I want to go down under development
36:11 - so I may hit Save Changes we're down
36:13 - here in the bottom there's a little
36:14 - option under development I'm gonna want
36:16 - to click that and I want to create a new
36:18 - application so I'm gonna create a new
36:20 - application it is coding train example
36:23 - bot
36:24 - the website will just be the coding
36:26 - train comm I want to what do I want to
36:30 - be able to do so you have a lot of
36:34 - options in terms of what permissions you
36:35 - can give your pot like maybe the bot can
36:38 - only read certain things or only write
36:42 - certain things but I'm actually going to
36:43 - keep the global the the read sort of
36:46 - global write checked and the read global
36:48 - read checked so that everything and
36:51 - follow so this bot could basically do
36:52 - everything it can read all the posts it
36:55 - can write all as many posts at once and
36:56 - it can
36:57 - so I'm gonna hit submit and then I'm
37:00 - gonna click here and now now the thing
37:03 - is this is stuff that I really do not
37:06 - want to share with anybody so at some
37:08 - point I'm gonna regenerate this which
37:10 - I'm going to do right now I'm actually
37:11 - going to whoops just Here I am back I'm
37:14 - gonna regenerate that access token so
37:17 - you know I don't really mind if who's
37:20 - gonna be able to like type this quick
37:21 - enough and hack my bot but here I come
37:24 - back but this is not something you want
37:27 - to share okay yeah there we go okay so
37:31 - now uh we're Mio
37:34 - okay you're gonna see it again you saw
37:37 - it again whatever let me go back to do
37:39 - that again alright so what I'm going to
37:47 - do is I'm going to quickly just turn the
37:48 - screen off no that's me I'm gonna turn
37:50 - the screen off there we go I'm gonna
37:52 - regenerate that access token I'm gonna
37:54 - go back to I'm gonna copy this stuff
37:58 - somewhere secret I'm not gonna worry
38:00 - about that now I'm gonna go back to
38:01 - Mastodon then I'm gonna put the screen
38:02 - back there I am so that you can't hack
38:06 - my thought at this alright so what's
38:08 - next
38:09 - I want there's a lot of different ways
38:11 - you could write a mastodon pot I'm sure
38:14 - you could come up with some way that I
38:16 - can't even think of right now I'm going
38:17 - to use nodejs which is a JavaScript
38:21 - framework for executing JavaScript code
38:23 - and I am going to ex do all this from
38:28 - the command line so I you if you're
38:31 - gonna want to have node installed and
38:32 - you're going also do you really want to
38:34 - have some shell access to your computer
38:35 - to be able to do this and I'll link to
38:37 - different workflow videos about how to
38:39 - get that stuff set up if you don't have
38:40 - that already so what I'm going to do is
38:42 - I'm in a directory I'm on coding train
38:44 - desktop Mastodon bot the first thing I'm
38:47 - going to do is I'm just gonna type NPM
38:48 - in it what this does is it starts up my
38:52 - node project this is gonna create a
38:54 - package.json file which has all the
38:56 - configuration information for my node
38:59 - project I could just manually then make
39:00 - that file or copy it from another
39:01 - project but it's nice that this tool
39:03 - will step me through it so package named
39:05 - Mastodon bot sounds good this is version
39:07 - I don't know zeros at point zero point
39:09 - one there's
39:10 - option is example code for Mastodon bot
39:14 - on coding train entry point I'm gonna
39:17 - have a file called bot Jas I'm not gonna
39:20 - worry about testing right now I don't
39:21 - have a git repository but Mastodon
39:25 - education will be some keywords the
39:27 - author is me I guess our license will be
39:31 - MIT and this looks all looks good to me
39:34 - so now if I open this up in Visual
39:37 - Studio code we can see it has created a
39:42 - it has created a package.json file with
39:46 - all of that information in it that I
39:48 - just typed it pause for a second
40:03 - I feel like this is a little bit big
40:06 - I should I like that that's bigger and
40:10 - then now I can go to preferences and
40:16 - change this and go here yeah that's
40:22 - better okay okay okay
40:30 - the next thing that I want to do is
40:32 - create my JavaScript file that is going
40:34 - to run the bot so I'm just going to
40:36 - click new file and I'm gonna say Bob
40:38 - Shaye yes and just to test things out
40:40 - I'm going to say console dot log
40:42 - Mastodon bot starting dot the dot so
40:46 - this is where all of my code for the bot
40:48 - is going to go and the very first thing
40:51 - that I'm going to do is just test this
40:52 - code by executing it and the way that I
40:54 - do that is going back to terminal and by
40:57 - the way yes they're ups it's not the
41:01 - right commands how do I do that
41:04 - no yeah there we go
41:12 - and by the way yes there is actually a
41:16 - terminal directly in in visual code
41:20 - studio and I could actually just run it
41:22 - right here by saying like node bot yes
41:25 - and maybe I should do that this is so
41:27 - tiny though I don't know why I'm just
41:30 - not used to using this terminal yet so
41:32 - I'm gonna stick with my using a separate
41:34 - I turn and I'm gonna run node bot J yes
41:36 - and we can see all doing is console
41:38 - logging that Mastodon bot starting okay
41:40 - how am I going to connect to Macedon so
41:43 - in order to do this I'm going to use a
41:45 - node package that will communicate with
41:48 - the Macedon API directly so let's find
41:51 - that I'm sure let's look at
41:53 - notifications let's start much node
41:57 - mastodons API and let's see so what
42:01 - comes up Mastodon - API NPM ago I've
42:06 - used this before in making a practice
42:08 - example so this one is going to work
42:10 - fine for me and so now the next thing
42:13 - that I need to do is I need to run NPM
42:16 - and
42:16 - stall because if I'm going to use this
42:18 - package to communicate with my bot I
42:21 - need to make sure I have it installed so
42:23 - this NPM install - - save Macedon API
42:27 - and yes I could use yarn which is
42:28 - another package manager for node but I'm
42:30 - still unlike an NPM person whenever
42:34 - there's the thing that people are using
42:36 - instead of yarn that's when I'll use
42:37 - yarn npm install' say the - - save by
42:41 - the way is a argument so that it
42:43 - automatically gets added to the package
42:45 - JSON file
42:46 - and there we go so if I go over here we
42:48 - can see if I look in packaged up JSON
42:50 - there is now also a dependency mastodons
42:54 - - api so that is now a project
42:56 - dependency and the first thing that i
42:58 - want to do to be able to use this is an
43:01 - actually documentation here
43:03 - documentation people what let's actually
43:06 - just go over to examples and click on
43:09 - streaming and this is what I want oh no
43:12 - I don't oh my goodness all right never
43:14 - mind
43:14 - hold on I have my own examples I think
43:19 - it's just require you no longer have to
43:24 - you alpha okay
43:37 - did any breaking who's out getting the
43:40 - chat is telling me that you no longer
43:41 - have to use - - save so maybe it it adds
43:44 - it automatically whether or not used -
43:46 - that save or not that's a nice little
43:47 - extra tip for today okay what I want to
43:50 - do now is require it and again I'm not
43:55 - using I'm in a sort of still I'm using
43:57 - require so I'm gonna say Const Mastodon
44:02 - equal let's just call it Const and maybe
44:05 - know let's I don't know Macedon equals
44:07 - require Mastodon
44:09 - - API so I am now requiring it which
44:13 - meaning that's basically I'm importing
44:14 - it and then what I want to do is I want
44:17 - to connect and there's a lot of ways
44:19 - that you can connect live in your code
44:22 - because maybe you're making an app and
44:24 - you want people to be authenticated with
44:25 - different accounts I don't need to do
44:26 - any of that I just want to do this new
44:34 - constant and constant and equals new
44:36 - Mastodon and I'm gonna do this and I'm
44:41 - gonna need to put in my access token I'm
44:43 - gonna need I don't I'm not too worried
44:45 - about this and I need to put in my
44:49 - particular instance which is bots in
44:54 - space so this is the this is the since I
44:57 - am now going to run my bot through BOTS
44:59 - in space the API URL for making API
45:02 - queries is at BOTS in space BOTS and dot
45:06 - space slash API slash v1 now maybe
45:08 - someday there'll be a v2 of the api v3
45:10 - but this should always work and now I
45:13 - just need to get that access token which
45:15 - I'm throwing caution to the wind by the
45:16 - time you watch this video the access
45:18 - token will have changed but just to show
45:20 - you I'm gonna go back to here I'm gonna
45:23 - go to settings that's fine I'm going to
45:27 - go to where am i development a coding
45:31 - training example bot I'm gonna grab the
45:34 - access token I'm gonna paste it here and
45:38 - then I think do you know I'm pretty sure
45:40 - I need also the client secret which is
45:46 - this thing and
45:52 - client a key which is this thing and
45:59 - then now I should be all set and
46:04 - connected so the next thing that I can
46:06 - do if I'm looking through this API oh
46:08 - yeah this is actually what I wanted to
46:10 - do yeah
46:12 - is I can't so now ah okay just pausing
46:22 - for a second as I'm seeing the chat
46:25 - typos and secret I see that Suraj is in
46:36 - the chat hello Suraj and Petros my son's
46:42 - middle name is Petros I wrote secret
46:45 - okay thank you I'm being told that I
46:49 - wrote secrets so that could be secret
46:52 - thank you very much
46:53 - all right so here's the thing we got to
46:55 - talk about something there are three
46:59 - there are three core ways to engage with
47:02 - the mastodon api sad to erase my
47:07 - beautifully decentralized diagram there
47:09 - are three ways to engage with the
47:11 - mastodon api and this is very similar to
47:14 - how twitter used to work from Twitter
47:16 - doesn't work this way anymore
47:17 - but luckily for us Mastodon does there
47:20 - is the get a get request is basically
47:23 - saying hey I would like to get a whole
47:25 - bunch of stuff like get me this list of
47:27 - user accounts get me this list of posts
47:30 - tooth statuses tweets whatever you want
47:32 - to call them search for every tooth that
47:35 - has the word mango in it that's what get
47:37 - is for there is also post I really
47:40 - should have written these in all capital
47:41 - letters post is for posting something to
47:44 - Mastodon like for example I want to post
47:47 - a new status or I want to follow or
47:50 - favorite or reblog something all of
47:52 - those are posts and then there is what
47:56 - is really the exciting thing the
47:59 - streaming API the streaming API is a way
48:02 - for you to
48:03 - essentially have almost like a socket
48:05 - connection like a an attached connection
48:10 - to to Macedon where you're just
48:11 - listening for events so every time
48:14 - somebody follows somebody you'll get an
48:15 - inventor
48:16 - every time somebody posts the status
48:18 - you'll get an event so this is what's
48:19 - really powerful in the way that you can
48:21 - kind of engage with the service in a in
48:24 - a real-time synchronous way and
48:26 - unfortunately this is a thing that
48:27 - Twitter recently removed from their API
48:29 - and there's other ways to do the same
48:31 - exact thing but it's a bit roundabout
48:33 - plus good luck getting your bot approved
48:35 - from Twitter or something that you can
48:37 - use there okay so this in this video to
48:40 - test the first idea out I just want to
48:43 - do a post so what I want to do is a post
48:45 - okay so coming back over here we can see
48:50 - this is what I have to do post with a
48:55 - some path now what is the path so now we
48:58 - need to look up mastodons api
49:00 - documentation and we should be able to
49:04 - on this page here look under posts and
49:09 - we can see i can this is a post for
49:13 - following something for blocking
49:15 - unblocking for muting but I want to pose
49:19 - the status
49:32 - hold on there we go sorry about that
49:37 - this is where it is I want to post a new
49:39 - status so remember what is my API URL
49:45 - it's this one so ultimately the endpoint
49:48 - that I want to go to is v1 statuses but
49:52 - I don't do it here the path I could put
49:55 - right here statuses then I need some
49:59 - parameters and I'm gonna put a call back
50:02 - which I will use my fancy es6 arrow
50:05 - syntax that I have covered in other
50:08 - videos I'll come back to that in a
50:09 - second so params let's make that a
50:11 - separate variable it's a JavaScript
50:13 - object
50:14 - so these pram this is super important
50:17 - what are the parameters well we go back
50:19 - to the API documentation and we can look
50:22 - here they are I could say this is the
50:24 - status the text that I want to pose in
50:26 - reply to well is it in reply to somebody
50:29 - a different an ID of a different status
50:31 - media IDs for images all sorts of stuff
50:34 - here language is it sensitive content
50:36 - there's also things but basically I'm
50:38 - just going to say status choo-choo and
50:44 - there we go hi why did you format
50:47 - yourself like this what kind of crazy
50:49 - indentation is that this isn't right I'm
50:51 - gonna have to deal with that later okay
50:53 - so now and then in the callback what do
50:57 - I get I probably probably like error
50:58 - first callbacks I'm guessing error data
51:02 - I'm going to do this so let's just do
51:03 - say like if error console dot error
51:07 - error and then otherwise console dot log
51:13 - data okay
51:15 - so now here we go I have my code right I
51:20 - started the bot I connected there's all
51:22 - my secret information in credit card
51:24 - number and and secure numbers embedded
51:26 - in there somewhere
51:27 - here's my status that I want to post and
51:29 - there we go and hopefully nobody's
51:31 - already hacked my account and posted
51:33 - stuff so let's go look over here okay
51:37 - wait no I'm in the wrong account where I
51:39 - got to go to box in space and I got to
51:43 - go to my profile which is
51:45 - anything yet somewhere it'll show up
51:46 - here where's my profile this me that's
51:51 - local who knows okay let's run this code
51:55 - node bot dodge is okay we got an error
51:58 - Mastodon is not defined wise Mastodon
52:01 - not defined because I used a capital
52:04 - down here and I didn't use a capital up
52:06 - here
52:06 - so this Mastodon importing the whole
52:09 - library is now a function that I can
52:10 - call to connect so let's try this again
52:13 - ooh that seemed to have worked except it
52:17 - didn't console.log anything how do I
52:20 - tell if I mmm-hmm
52:28 - that things seem to work hold on time
52:30 - out for a second
52:34 - I did path of status not statuses okay
52:39 - so so that didn't work alright so how am
52:44 - I going that didn't seem to work thank
52:48 - you
52:49 - - Wilbur in the chat who just told me
52:51 - that I actually put the wrong path here
52:54 - yeah so if I go back to the API
52:56 - documentation you can see the path the
52:59 - endpoint is statuses plural so let's try
53:02 - this one more time
53:03 - statuses and now let me run this again
53:07 - ah look and we can see we've got all
53:10 - this metadata back because it was
53:11 - successful if I go back here if I go to
53:14 - boxing space look at that there we are
53:16 - choo-choo okay we did it
53:22 - we successfully made our first Mastodon
53:25 - bot that is posting just from just from
53:31 - the node directly to Mastodon okay so
53:34 - there's a few things that I want to show
53:36 - you next I would like to show you number
53:38 - one is how to effectively hide your you
53:40 - can open source your bot but still hide
53:42 - your your client secret client code all
53:46 - that sort of stuff so I'm going to show
53:47 - you that and also we'll just look at
53:49 - some of the other parameters for some of
53:53 - the other parameters for posting
54:01 - I'm getting a lot of notifications that
54:08 - sound you're hearing is the Mossad
54:10 - notification where are we
54:12 - three how did it get to be 326 geez
54:15 - Louise
54:16 - oh no but I have to I I started at 2:30
54:18 - authoritative - okay I like this all
54:28 - right - I got to do a couple things
54:29 - number like I'm sorry you all of you who
54:31 - like your four spaces of indentation I
54:35 - don't know where that happened how that
54:40 - got changed in my where did that get
54:50 - changed but I can't tolerate it
55:01 - where where are these things lips hold
55:04 - on
55:11 - satting is closer to the top okay
55:15 - fontsize ah there we go there we go it
55:21 - just went right past it okay you know
55:26 - user settings I know I want to use her
55:28 - everything okay how come that doesn't do
55:34 - I actually have to change something
55:35 - no no what why sit here
55:56 - Oh director like Reap I skipped it and
55:59 - uh you guys are behind me why why I
56:03 - can't I can't continue this setting is
56:11 - overridden based on the file contents
56:14 - when editor detection is on oops I want
56:22 - to turn that off then oh I see because
56:29 - that makes sense that you would have
56:31 - this editor editor detection hold on
56:37 - come on - well it's the oddest round
56:59 - is it because it like detected for space
57:04 - and now if I take out all the floor
57:06 - space you can't detect it and it will go
57:10 - back to two spaces for ah how do I
57:20 - change this I know it cheats out to four
57:25 - from two to look at that for when you
57:31 - open the code file at the bottom right
57:35 - you have to change it Oh change view ah
57:47 - okay oh my god everything's okay now
57:51 - whoa well I was robbed that was really
57:54 - details really bad okay okay
58:00 - whoo whoo I'm sweating like a crazy all
58:09 - right
58:10 - all right everybody all right so here's
58:20 - there's a couple options okay dot so
58:27 - I've never actually used dot env env
58:31 - package before I what I always do is but
58:38 - so and then so I would make a dot env
58:41 - file and then I would get ignore it when
58:43 - I yeah okay so let me try doing that
58:45 - okay okay okay
58:56 - all right okay
59:02 - okay
59:03 - Oh a nicely let me recycle the camera
59:14 - okay I am back I'm going to do some I
59:17 - made a mastodon bot all it did so far
59:20 - was tweet tweet it to knit ah to tweet
59:25 - blog post who knows where all this stuff
59:27 - is all I know is that it said choo choo
59:30 - so I would like to show you some more
59:34 - things to make the bot a little bit
59:36 - better before we move on and hopefully
59:37 - start making some actual interesting
59:39 - examples of different kinds of BOTS you
59:41 - might want to try to make so the first
59:42 - thing that I want to do is actually I
59:44 - don't want to have all of this all of
59:47 - these secret keys and everything right
59:49 - here in my code because I'm gonna upload
59:50 - this as an example for other people to
59:52 - use I want to be able to hide that stuff
59:54 - away but still use it and there's
59:55 - actually a wonderful node package thank
59:57 - you to Alka for the suggestion called
60:02 - dot env so I'm gonna say npm install dot
60:08 - env we install this node package and
60:11 - what this allows me to do is create
60:13 - environment variables for a particular
60:16 - project and that way I can upload the
60:19 - code without the values of those
60:21 - environment variables but anybody who's
60:23 - using that code could set the own values
60:25 - set their own values of that those
60:27 - environment variables so what I'm going
60:29 - to need to do is create a new file I'm
60:32 - going to call it dot E and V so it's
60:34 - kind of like these you can see it right
60:36 - here it's like a hidden file dot and V
60:37 - it even has this crazy settings thing
60:40 - and then in this oh look there's all
60:43 - these extensions I could use probably to
60:45 - like format it and all sorts of fancy
60:47 - ways but I'm not going to be fancy what
60:49 - I'm going to do and I'm looking over
60:50 - here because thankfully alka gave me
60:53 - some suggestions I'm gonna say things
60:54 - like auth token equals client secret
61:00 - equals and I'm going to say client ID
61:04 - equals I think those are my three things
61:06 - so they're in
61:06 - code client key is this I'm gonna put
61:11 - this back in here client key okay
61:14 - because client key is what I meant do I
61:16 - need to does it need to be in quotes
61:18 - maybe somebody can tell me maybe it
61:19 - shouldn't be in quotes actually I'm
61:22 - gonna get the client secret I'm gonna go
61:25 - back to the env file and put that in
61:27 - here right now I'm using single quotes
61:28 - which may or may not be correct then I'm
61:31 - gonna go back to my code I'm going to
61:32 - get the access token and I'm gonna call
61:36 - it access token just to be consistent
61:38 - with my naming and now if I do this I
61:43 - can now go to my bot and I can also say
61:48 - constant iya en v equals require and
61:54 - then I want to require a dot E and B and
61:57 - then wait timeout for a second choir dot
62:03 - E and V dot config oh and I need to walk
62:06 - and fake okay no quotes okay a sample
62:17 - one yep yeah yeah okay I will do that
62:19 - without quotes okay okay
62:27 - [Music]
62:29 - okay actually just for consistency's
62:31 - sake maybe I'll make this capital
62:32 - letters I don't know then I'm gonna say
62:34 - then I need to call Ian V dot config
62:36 - which will load it the chat thankfully
62:39 - help me out that I do not want quotes
62:40 - here these are just the values and then
62:46 - I should be able to now down here so I
62:52 - should be able to say ah I should be
62:53 - able to say process en v dot client key
63:00 - so I should this well now is that right
63:04 - process env let me take a look I have
63:06 - the documentation over here yeah I think
63:09 - that's right
63:09 - so I should be able to grab those
63:11 - environment variables whoops just like
63:15 - this then the client secret
63:20 - then I should be able to grab this one
63:23 - and say access token who knows if I've
63:29 - made some mistakes but let's try running
63:32 - this now let's choo choo choo choo choo
63:37 - choo let's say choo choo twice and let's
63:41 - run this
63:43 - alright I think this might have worked
63:48 - and we can see oh this is the wrong page
63:52 - again choo choo choo choo ok we can see
63:55 - that work so the all of this stuff is
63:58 - now hidden inside my environment file
64:04 - and what I'm Goll so going to do now is
64:07 - I'm gonna make a I'm gonna make another
64:10 - file called dot env sample and then I'm
64:14 - gonna copy this into there
64:17 - whoops except I don't know how to use
64:21 - this computer thingy do that again
64:31 - lately
64:33 - go away I'm going to copy this into here
64:40 - and then I'm going to take out all this
64:43 - stuff I'm gonna make because eventually
64:46 - I'll put this on get I'm gonna make a
64:49 - file called dot get ignore and then I'm
64:52 - going to say dot E and V so basically
64:55 - what I've done is I'm saying hey this is
64:58 - my file dot env that's my file that I'm
65:00 - only ever going to have locally on my
65:02 - computer but when I publish this I'm
65:05 - gonna publish a sample one which has
65:08 - information basically about what you
65:09 - need to put in there and then I'm gonna
65:12 - make sure that the actual dot env file
65:14 - is not included if I ever check this
65:16 - into a git repository uploaded on github
65:18 - so to speak all right
65:20 - let's make sure this works still working
65:26 - we can go here and I've said ok somebody
65:30 - definitely hacked my bot
65:32 - which is great because I had my keys up
65:34 - on the screen well done whoever you are
65:37 - and I am going to take a break and
65:42 - regenerate my access keys so that nobody
65:44 - else can hack my BOTS keep them hidden
65:46 - in my environment file and then I am
65:49 - going to before something bad happens
65:51 - I'm gonna just close out of this window
65:54 - and I'm gonna come back and show you
65:56 - more about writing Mastodon BOTS and I'm
66:00 - going to I'm going to show you this fun
66:02 - thing called spoiler text and how to
66:05 - have the bots post to Mastodon
66:07 - periodically every so often okay so see
66:09 - you in the next video alright so I am
66:13 - going to now go to choo choo choo choo
66:17 - does space know no BOTS in space can
66:19 - never remember which thing I'm at I'm
66:21 - gonna go to settings developer
66:28 - development here we go I'm going to say
66:33 - goodbye to the screen everybody I'm now
66:35 - gonna regenerate my access token the
66:37 - client key and client secret I don't
66:39 - think change they're the same so well
66:42 - you all have those but you cannot have
66:45 - my access token which is all unfortunate
66:48 - actually you know what maybe I should
66:49 - delete this one I'm gonna delete this
66:50 - one let me see if I can delete I'm gonna
66:54 - delete it and start over sorry that you
66:56 - can't see what I'm doing because it's
66:58 - actually not so great for everybody to
66:59 - have the client secret and client ID cuz
67:02 - you could still write a bot and then
67:04 - like authorize with for the access token
67:05 - so I'm just gonna regenerate everything
67:08 - I'm gonna hit a submit and then I'm
67:12 - gonna get those now I have all three new
67:15 - things you can't see what I'm doing
67:17 - token that was the client key actually
67:20 - client key client secret sorry that I
67:27 - have to narrate this an access token
67:30 - save save clothes clothes bring that
67:36 - back and now let's just run this one
67:40 - more time
67:42 - great alright thank you I hope you all
67:45 - enjoyed your
67:46 - time hacking my bot alright one more
67:54 - time everybody
67:56 - [Laughter]
67:59 - [Music]
68:02 - delete it's all gone
68:05 - new application code extreme example bot
68:11 - coding strain calm submit here we go I
68:18 - got a new client key everybody new
68:20 - client key clanky now I got a new client
68:26 - secret it starts with f7 a new access
68:31 - token and now I'm gonna close both the
68:38 - dot env file and I also going to get out
68:40 - of that page um
68:43 - and I am going to bring this back up now
68:48 - I'm gonna make sure it works there we go
68:54 - go here now there we go alright now we
68:58 - should also do some stuff can I quickly
69:02 - hold on a sec most people put the
69:11 - require okay I will fix that Thank You
69:13 - Alka for a comment about where to put
69:14 - the require alright so now let me just
69:19 - do something real quick what was I on
69:21 - BOTS in space login what was it called
69:25 - coding trained bots email address Daniel
69:34 - at the coding train calm so I just want
69:37 - to add a like a header and stuff and I
69:39 - have it on this computer so sorry you
69:41 - can't see what I'm doing rainbow
69:45 - oh no I'm signing up ah login
70:03 - okay and edit profile somebody I'm
70:09 - getting like a lot spammed here oh no
70:11 - Sam is just favoring a lot of my
70:12 - statuses I'm going to at get an avatar
70:17 - here where can I find this here we go
70:25 - I like the semicolon alright okay I can
70:38 - play around with the well you know what
70:43 - that's the look at that crazy Sam I go
70:45 - hold on I'm just gonna just go change
70:47 - this there's a different semicolon I
70:49 - meant to use this is very important this
70:52 - is exactly what I need to be doing right
70:53 - now edit profile just told us it's very
71:03 - very important that I have the correct
71:05 - semicolon there we go that was not the
71:10 - correct semicolon character that is the
71:14 - correct semicolon character I thank you
71:15 - very much okay now
71:34 - okay
71:40 - okay let me get back to the chats here
71:44 - and here we go okay
71:48 - cycle the camera I've got about 45
71:52 - minutes here so you can keep going
71:57 - alright I'm back again this is another
72:00 - video I'm just continuing making this
72:02 - mastodons bot and I got some good tips
72:06 - first of all I get kind of like a goofy
72:07 - thing here this dot env package for its
72:11 - I guess good practice or a convention to
72:13 - just put it the first thing and I can
72:15 - just call dot E and V dot config I don't
72:17 - need to save it in a variable I can do
72:19 - this just in one line of code so let me
72:20 - clean that up that's a little bit nicer
72:22 - now the other thing that I want to do is
72:26 - I want to make this bot post every so
72:32 - often and so a quick way that I can do
72:35 - that is with the set interval function
72:36 - so oh you know what I should also do
72:39 - look at this let me show you something
72:40 - so one thing that I often like to do so
72:43 - if I run this right now I'm actually
72:46 - just ran it you can see this is all of
72:49 - the information that I get back when I
72:52 - visit the response from Mastodon after I
72:55 - have to did awkward I'm gonna get I'm
73:03 - waiting self aware of what people are
73:05 - going to like post in the comments for
73:08 - my editing this is the response that I
73:11 - get after I post to Matt Mastodon so I
73:14 - get each toot has an ID it has a
73:17 - timestamp
73:18 - it has metadata about whether it's a
73:20 - reply to something yes its content you
73:22 - can see it's formatted with HTML so what
73:25 - I actually would like to do is not just
73:27 - console.log all of this JSON data to the
73:29 - to the console I would like to just pick
73:32 - and choose a few things to console log
73:34 - out as kind of debugging information and
73:36 - also something that I often like to do
73:38 - just to kind of like help me with this
73:40 - kind of stuff is use the built in node a
73:44 - file system package so I'm gonna require
73:47 - file system this is not a package I need
73:49 - to install it just comes with no to know
73:52 - whatever
73:52 - no you're using and I'm actually going
73:54 - to say right here I'm gonna say
73:56 - filesystem dot right file sync which is
74:03 - a synchronous file writing and then I'm
74:06 - gonna say I want to write this data
74:07 - actually the path is first and then the
74:11 - thing that I want to write which is
74:12 - probably json dot stringify i want to
74:16 - stringify the data and i want it to have
74:19 - - space - space tabs and then i need to
74:22 - write this file out so I could just say
74:24 - data JSON and then if I run this again
74:29 - we should see now all the sudden I have
74:32 - a new JSON file that appeared in my
74:36 - directory here and I can look at it and
74:39 - now if I want to kind of like figure out
74:41 - what's the data that I get back I have
74:42 - this as a reference so I can now and I
74:46 - could time stamp the name of the file
74:48 - and all sorts of things like that but I
74:49 - can now go and I can just comment this
74:51 - out and I can now I could be more
74:54 - thoughtful about this and I could say
74:56 - you know console dot log you know
74:58 - success ID and then I could put sorry I
75:04 - need to go back here and I could say
75:06 - it's data dot ID created at so I would
75:10 - go back here and I would say data ID
75:15 - plus data dot created at you know what
75:22 - you know about what's it called what's
75:24 - the thing called template literals
75:30 - working today it was working on Friday I
75:33 - had that spicy food for lunch and it
75:35 - really did something to me that what
75:41 - it's called template literals JavaScript
75:45 - yes
75:49 - actually this is a good book I really
75:52 - should just do a separate video on this
75:53 - entirely because it's such a wonderful
75:54 - feature of JavaScript now but I can
75:56 - actually you know how I'm always doing
75:58 - this console logging some text and then
76:00 - some variable stuff and I'm joining with
76:01 - the plus and concatenation you can use
76:03 - something called template literals which
76:05 - is a way of embedding expressions inside
76:08 - of a string and the way to do that is
76:11 - with instead of quotes with backticks
76:14 - so if I put a back tick at the start and
76:16 - the beginning I no longer need this plus
76:18 - I'm just gonna I'm gonna get rid of all
76:21 - this nonsense
76:24 - except you know idea I'm just gonna do
76:26 - ID and timestamp : and so now this is a
76:32 - string and it has basically like I want
76:35 - ID this is what I want to literally see
76:37 - and hen what I want to see is the value
76:40 - of this and the way that I do that is
76:41 - with dollar sign curly bracket curly
76:44 - bracket so now anything inside of here
76:46 - is an expression so I could write 4 plus
76:48 - 7 and it would it would it would it
76:49 - would put 11 in the string and then I
76:52 - can say timestamp II I can make this
76:56 - like this and now we can run this again
77:00 - one more time
77:02 - no dot J yes and we can see this is what
77:05 - I get now ID and timestamp so this is
77:08 - what's going to I'm gonna see and maybe
77:10 - I'll be useful for me to also put the
77:11 - content there who knows what I want to
77:12 - login console dot log but I want to be
77:14 - more thoughtful about that not just spit
77:16 - out massive amounts of JSON data okay
77:18 - let's get to the good part now what I
77:22 - want to do is my first example of a bot
77:24 - is I want to make a random number bot
77:27 - so I am going to say I'm gonna use
77:29 - template literals again I'm going to say
77:33 - the meaning of life is and then I'm
77:37 - going to use an expression I'm gonna say
77:39 - math dot floor mat you know let me put
77:42 - this in a separate variable constant num
77:46 - equals math.floor math.random times 100
77:51 - we'll see if we get 42 and then I'm
77:53 - gonna just put that here
77:59 - and now this I bought should now post
78:04 - the meaning of life is this random
78:06 - number so math dot random gives me a
78:08 - random number a floating-point number
78:09 - between zero and one I multiply that by
78:12 - a hundred so I get a number between zero
78:14 - and 100 I mean technically the highest
78:15 - number is ninety nine point ninety nine
78:16 - and a nine and then math dot floor takes
78:19 - off the decimal point so I now have a
78:21 - ran number between 0 and 99 I could add
78:23 - one if I want between 100 whatever
78:24 - that's not the point the point is now
78:26 - and you know what I really would like to
78:28 - see from the console what it posted so
78:32 - I'm also just gonna do this console log
78:35 - data dot what was it if I now I can go
78:38 - back to my data JSON and it's going to
78:41 - be where is the content content just
78:45 - data not content so I'm gonna say data
78:49 - dot content we're getting somewhere so
78:53 - let's run this one more time success the
78:58 - meaning of life is 95 okay to forget it
79:01 - we can go here we can double check and
79:05 - somehow I went away from there the
79:07 - meaning of life is 95 great okay now two
79:09 - more things I want to do make this bot
79:11 - exciting I am now going to use set
79:15 - interval so the idea here is this is all
79:19 - of my code to post to mastodons and
79:24 - again if this is new to you if you've if
79:26 - you've just been watching my p5.js
79:27 - videos this weird syntax this arrow
79:30 - syntax part of es6 javascript might be
79:32 - unfamiliar to you i will put a link to a
79:34 - video where i describe what arrow syntax
79:35 - is in this video's description okay so
79:39 - now what I want to do is all this stuff
79:40 - here is basically just a function called
79:43 - toot alright because what I want to do
79:46 - is this function will pick a random
79:49 - number create the status and post it
79:51 - what I want to do is I want to say now
79:53 - set interval and I want to do this toot
79:57 - every 5,000 milliseconds which would be
80:00 - every 5 seconds now this is a bit
80:02 - extreme this is problem this is not
80:04 - really appropriate bought a ticket to
80:06 - have a bot that posts every 5 seconds so
80:08 - you know probably a much more thoughtful
80:11 - way of doing this if you're gonna
80:12 - bought that posts an automated way maybe
80:14 - it's a word of the day or a haiku of the
80:16 - day maybe it's just once a day once an
80:18 - hour
80:19 - what's an hour might be really the
80:21 - maximum there but just to test it I'm
80:22 - gonna do it every five seconds birth
80:27 - like burping on a live stream and I
80:33 - guess I can take this moment to thank
80:35 - pa7 war welcome to as a new member I'm
80:41 - going to I'm going to run this every
80:44 - five seconds which is reasonable just
80:46 - for testing something interesting know
80:48 - about set interval is like what if I
80:50 - make this like every 50 seconds if I run
80:54 - this right now I'm gonna wait 50 seconds
80:57 - for it to do the first time so and
80:59 - that's not really such a great thing so
81:01 - I am going to actually also just call it
81:04 - once first and then do it every five
81:06 - seconds okay here we go
81:09 - meaning of life is well it really picked
81:11 - 99 that is awesome and it's 48 oh we're
81:15 - getting close to 42 we can see it's
81:17 - doing this every five seconds I'm gonna
81:19 - quit out of it and I'm gonna go back to
81:23 - here we can see there it is these are my
81:25 - posts that I did you can see 10 seconds
81:27 - ago 10 seconds ago now I mean this is
81:29 - really five seconds ago all right so
81:31 - here's the thing I want to show you
81:33 - there's so much more remember how I made
81:36 - this these parameters all I'm doing is
81:39 - saying this is the status that I want to
81:41 - post automatically from my node program
81:43 - well one of the things that I can
81:45 - actually do is I can go back to the
81:47 - documentation there are all these other
81:48 - things so media IDs is something I
81:50 - really want to show you in a future
81:51 - video it's a way I can include an image
81:53 - or other media with the with the post
81:56 - but one thing that I could do that's
81:58 - kind of fun is just this spoiler text
82:00 - thing so what spoiler text does it
82:03 - allows me to have sort of two aspects to
82:08 - the post the meaning of life is
82:10 - and then the status can just be none so
82:14 - I'm going to break this up into two
82:15 - parts and I need a comma here and I'm
82:17 - just going to show you what this looks
82:18 - like so I'm using these parameters
82:20 - different properties of the JavaScript
82:23 - object that's going to go here into my
82:25 - PO
82:25 - call and I'm going to now run this one
82:28 - more time
82:29 - and I'm gonna go back to my bot and I'm
82:32 - gonna look and you can see look at this
82:33 - the meaning of life but I now have this
82:34 - nice water button so spoiler alert if
82:38 - you click on this you'll see that it's
82:39 - 52 or that it's 23 and again I'm doing
82:42 - this too often so I'm going to
82:44 - absolutely quit this and then if I
82:46 - wanted to do now if I want to have my
82:48 - bot post once a day every 24 hours I can
82:52 - just go right back to my code and I can
82:54 - say get set interval should be 24 hours
82:58 - there's 60 minutes at 24 hours
83:00 - 60 minutes an hour 60 seconds an hour
83:02 - and 1000 milliseconds in a second so now
83:05 - here we go
83:06 - we now have a bot Mastodon bot that will
83:10 - post a numeric meeting of life once a
83:12 - day so in theory if I just left this
83:14 - running here and never closed my laptop
83:16 - or never did anything this would just
83:18 - run forever and once a day post the
83:21 - truth of the matter is gonna have to
83:22 - think about well once you've created
83:23 - your bot like where are you going
83:25 - where's that bot gonna live I mean you
83:26 - could have it live on your laptop or
83:28 - computer that's always plugged in and
83:29 - always connected to the Internet but
83:31 - more likely you're going to want to host
83:32 - it on a web server on some sort of
83:34 - server or maybe get a Raspberry Pi and
83:36 - plug it into the wall and have it always
83:38 - sitting there connect to the internet I
83:39 - will cover that in future videos in fact
83:41 - I have covered that for how to deploy a
83:43 - Twitter bot and ultimately it's exactly
83:46 - the same thing but just now the code has
83:47 - changed it's working with Mastodon okay
83:49 - so I'm gonna show you a bunch of other
83:51 - kinds of things you can do in BOTS most
83:52 - notably listen the streaming API whoops
84:03 - most notably listen using the streaming
84:06 - API so the streaming API is a way that I
84:08 - could connect and I could say anybody
84:10 - anybody ever mentions me I could reply
84:12 - to them so I gotta have a bot that
84:14 - participates in a conversation one thing
84:16 - you should really think about I'll talk
84:17 - about this again at the beginning of the
84:18 - next video I mentioned BOTS and acket
84:20 - etiquette but I if you really want to be
84:23 - thoughtful about making a bot that's not
84:25 - suddenly going to spam people so it's
84:27 - not gonna just pick random Mastodon
84:28 - users and start at mentioning them or
84:31 - start picking random posts and replying
84:33 - to them you really want your bot to
84:34 - engage when people opt in to engage so
84:37 - maybe you only want to post messages to
84:40 - people who have chosen to follow the
84:41 - bots are chosen to mention the bots
84:43 - already in in a particular post so I
84:46 - just can't say it's a post because I
84:48 - haven't gotten comfortable just when I
84:49 - got comfortable saying tweet I'm now the
84:51 - longer comfortable saying toot but I'll
84:53 - get there I'll get there eventually
84:54 - ok see you in the next video all right
85:05 - ok
85:07 - how are we doing everybody
85:18 - okay so I think I want to use the nice
85:24 - work David Hall look at all these people
85:27 - following along so nice should probably
85:32 - turn off so what how much time do I have
85:35 - here I want to let me make a list of
85:39 - stuff that I want to do like if I think
85:40 - about what my Twitter bot examples used
85:42 - to do sorry this is from my program if
85:58 - ages eCourse last year and week for
86:01 - Twitter so I guess it's useful to show
86:08 - it's definitely useful to show how to
86:09 - like reblog and reply I think that's
86:13 - what I'll go for next and then how to do
86:17 - an image okay I think that's makes sense
86:21 - so we need the streaming so I need to
86:28 - use the stream so I think what I want to
86:29 - do also is duplicate this so let me
86:34 - close all these files it's four o'clock
86:37 - I don't have a ton of time left but I
86:40 - would like to get a little further oh
86:43 - it's just ok where am I doing here
87:01 - let's make a folder called Mastodon
87:04 - let's put Mastodon bots in in there let
87:10 - me call it but one and then let me just
87:17 - duplicate it
87:21 - oh you know I I'll mention this ice Troy
87:26 - I forgot to put node modules in the get
87:27 - ignore now let me go here close this so
87:47 - now I have both of these this chain
87:50 - doesn't change this I can so I can get
87:54 - rid of all right this is fine not touch
88:06 - a yes I guess I'll leave the code as is
88:10 - let's spot one I'm such a doofus this
88:19 - one is 2 this one is 1 and here we go ok
88:30 - ok
88:35 - seems like I should have more space here
88:38 - [Music]
88:41 - ok
88:45 - okay so I think I'm ready for the next
88:47 - phase of this and Oh screaming API
88:53 - that's what I need to remember how I
89:01 - stream the stream - user okay okay
89:11 - okay and I think actually is this yeah
89:21 - there we go
89:23 - perfect okay perfect okay
89:38 - sowhat's ah come on alright I'm ready I
89:44 - can do though I've got a half an hour
89:46 - here I can definitely do this next piece
90:04 - ah okay alright everybody here we go
90:18 - hello alright I'm still working with
90:22 - Mastodon and what I'm going to do in
90:24 - this video now is I'm going to take the
90:27 - sample Bock that I made and instead of
90:30 - just on a timer every 24 hours every 60
90:32 - minutes I happen to post something I -
90:34 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
90:37 - the streaming API the streaming API is a
90:40 - way for me to in real time listen for
90:43 - events and the particular kind of events
90:46 - that I'm going to listen for are what's
90:48 - known as user events so a user event and
90:51 - will see all the different kinds as any
90:52 - time that I might get a notification or
90:54 - somebody that I follow might post
90:56 - something or any time that I might real
90:57 - good anyway there's lots of things that
90:59 - come in user events and these are the
91:01 - good ones to use because if you're using
91:03 - your user event as a bot you're sort of
91:05 - making sure that your bot only engages
91:07 - with people who are opting in and this
91:08 - is pretty important you don't want your
91:10 - botches randomly spamming people and
91:12 - favoriting random things or replying to
91:14 - random people who haven't really asked
91:16 - to engage with your pot so you're gonna
91:17 - want to make sure that your bot follows
91:19 - the the code of conduct and the terms of
91:21 - service of box in space I'll show you
91:23 - where you can find that but typically a
91:25 - good way to think about is just like if
91:26 - somebody is at mentioning the bot then
91:28 - you're welcome to reply to them if
91:30 - somebody follows you then you're also
91:31 - welcome to engage with that person as
91:33 - the bias as the bot programmer okay so
91:35 - let's go over and look at the streaming
91:36 - API and let me actually go to bots in
91:41 - space about okay so before I before I
91:50 - start using the streaming API let me
91:53 - just point out to read the information
91:54 - page with the code of conduct and also
91:57 - the Terms of Service if you're choosing
91:59 - to host your bot on bot send dot space
92:01 - you're gonna want to make sure you
92:02 - follow the rules of the space okay now
92:05 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
92:08 - start using the streaming API so the way
92:10 - that I do that and we can find it here
92:12 - remember this is the node package that
92:14 - I'm using mastodons - API and
92:16 - is basically what I want to do I want to
92:18 - create a listener and whenever there is
92:20 - a message I want to take a look at and
92:24 - do stuff act upon that message so let's
92:26 - actually do it exactly this I'm gonna
92:28 - keep the error one in here as well I'm
92:29 - just gonna copy paste this into my code
92:36 - I'm gonna comment out this auto posting
92:39 - thing that I had before about the
92:40 - meaning of life I'm just gonna put this
92:42 - here and actually what I want to do now
92:46 - is I want to use my little trick instead
92:48 - of just console logging the message if
92:51 - you remember a little trick that I did
92:52 - in the previous video is I used write
92:58 - file so I want to write files out so I
93:01 - can look at what kind of messages I'm
93:03 - getting oops ah where have I gone and so
93:07 - let me uncomment this out and I do want
93:09 - to put like a timestamp also here so it
93:14 - would make sense for me to say like data
93:17 - and then actually the message probably
93:21 - has a timestamp built into it but I can
93:23 - also like JavaScript timestamp I think
93:27 - it's just like new date get time yeah so
93:30 - I can say a new date get time I think
93:35 - this is right so again you can put with
93:38 - template literals I can put a whole
93:40 - string to eval eval u8 in essence inside
93:44 - that area okay so let's see if this
93:46 - works I don't know what's gonna happen
93:49 - oh wait let me see am I in the right
93:52 - place - no sorry I made a new folder so
93:54 - I'm gonna release these examples
93:56 - separately and I'm gonna run this bot
93:58 - and now okay so I don't know if it's
94:02 - working because I don't know if I've
94:03 - gotten any notification maybe somebody
94:05 - watching this live is gonna favorite
94:07 - something or @mention my bot that would
94:09 - be nice right
94:10 - and then something would come in for
94:11 - here I kind of think that maybe there
94:13 - was actually a mistake in the mastodons
94:16 - api's documentation because I have a
94:19 - memory when I tried doing this earlier
94:20 - that the event was not message but MSG
94:24 - short for message let's be sure about
94:27 - this
94:30 - oh oh wait no no okay so look at this
94:35 - somebody did somebody did so Mattia
94:40 - let's that is correct so you can you can
94:43 - edit out my room go from when I was
94:46 - sitting there waiting to edit to now oh
94:48 - I did get a message from somebody but I
94:51 - made some sort of mistake data is not
94:54 - defined okay because oh yes it's called
95:00 - the variable name is an MSG for message
95:02 - which is why I was thinking that I guess
95:04 - so it should be MSG here okay let's try
95:07 - this again
95:08 - and actually I'm just gonna take this
95:11 - out and I'm just gonna write console.log
95:16 - user event
95:18 - all right everybody are you watching are
95:20 - you giving me some user events here we
95:22 - go waiting for my user events user event
95:34 - [Music]
95:36 - let's get a bunch more
95:40 - [Music]
95:50 - [Music]
95:57 - okay I think that was enough user events
96:00 - thank you very much let's go back and we
96:03 - can see here that I have all of these
96:04 - data JSON files for all these events so
96:07 - I can kind of click through them and see
96:08 - what kind of events I'm hoping that the
96:11 - kind people of the internet are not
96:12 - spamming me with horribly thing horrible
96:15 - things and oh by the way if you want
96:19 - don't want your information appearing up
96:21 - here maybe don't but these are just
96:22 - people's Mastodon accounts so we can see
96:24 - this was a follow event it's an event of
96:26 - notification it's a type follow so let's
96:28 - do this right now let's respond to that
96:30 - so what we're gonna do
96:33 - hold on a sec pause blow my nose
96:53 - so the first kind of event we got here
96:56 - is a follow event so if the event is a
96:59 - notification of type follow we could act
97:01 - on that so let's do that let's say let's
97:05 - go back to our code and I'm gonna say
97:08 - right here I'm gonna not write these out
97:11 - anymore if if message dot what was it
97:20 - again a message dot event equals
97:26 - notification and I think there's going
97:30 - to be different kinds of notifications
97:31 - so I'm gonna say then if message dot
97:36 - data type follow then what I want to do
97:44 - is I want to get the username so let me
97:48 - get the user name and that would be
97:52 - where it would be right there and
97:55 - actually I want the account the username
97:58 - is useful but you always unmasked it on
97:59 - need both the username and the instance
98:02 - the address of the instance the host
98:04 - name so let me grab a count equals
98:09 - message data count and then the other
98:13 - thing that I pretty sure that I need is
98:15 - the ID maybe seven six seven zero that's
98:18 - the account ID this is the I don't know
98:20 - what this is the ID of the event I guess
98:22 - so I want that account ID so I'm gonna
98:24 - say constant ID equals message data ID
98:28 - oh that account I forgot about it can
98:32 - also message that data dot account that
98:34 - ID that account dot account and then dot
98:38 - account ID and then I want to send a
98:43 - message so how do I do that just with
98:46 - this nice and post so here's the thing
98:49 - maybe I want to make this quote-unquote
98:52 - to to function a bit more generic and
98:54 - I'm just going to give it a
98:56 - us I'm gonna pass in a status so I'm
99:00 - gonna get rid of the random number stuff
99:02 - which was from before and then I'm gonna
99:06 - just put there's a little confusing but
99:10 - I'm gonna take whatever I pass in and
99:12 - then and then here is and then I'm going
99:15 - to post that so now I have a function
99:17 - that I can basically say toot and I can
99:24 - say I mean used at data dot message da
99:31 - da da da to count right at this is me
99:34 - referencing the person that followed me
99:38 - you know thank you for the follow and I
99:42 - should be I'll just say choo choo
99:43 - welcome aboard
99:44 - that's a train themed welcome aboard ok
99:48 - so we could see it'll say welcome aboard
99:49 - now here's the thing hmm I really should
99:54 - also if I go back to the API this one I
99:58 - should probably say in reply
100:01 - that's the reply to this step I guess I
100:02 - don't need it's not read reply to a
100:04 - specific status so this is actually fine
100:06 - I think as long as I just mention then
100:08 - I'm done so so let me go alright I've
100:11 - lost my code let me go back I think I'm
100:13 - good so now I think that I have
100:16 - everything I want
100:17 - so I am let me just put the listened on
100:21 - error up here so I'm listening for a
100:23 - message if the message is a notification
100:25 - of a follow then I will talk back to the
100:29 - person there their account name and say
100:31 - welcome aboard and let's see how this
100:33 - goes I look forward to all of you now
100:37 - you can unfollow and follow if you
100:39 - already followed but let me run it first
100:41 - and here we go okay have a status status
100:45 - I have a mistake here I'm just gonna
100:49 - change this variable name to like txt or
100:52 - content let me make it content cuz I
100:54 - don't like having the same name
100:56 - everywhere it's confusing but there
100:58 - should be no semicolon after there okay
100:59 - here we go
101:05 - [Music]
101:10 - welcome aboard welcome aboard okay so
101:28 - you can see a bunch came in and now I
101:31 - can go back here and I can go to here
101:35 - and we can see look at this these are
101:36 - all the people who have now and if I
101:39 - click there we can see where it's it's
101:41 - showing me and going to these people's
101:43 - accounts yay so we now have a bot that
101:47 - responds to follows pause for a second
101:50 - oh right I'm such a doofus I'm almost
102:00 - like my nose is running allergies I
102:02 - think okay
102:12 - alka from the chat pointed out something
102:14 - here what did I do
102:15 - oh the whole point of me making this
102:17 - variable was so that I don't have to
102:19 - write this all out here I don't know why
102:20 - I did that so I can just do this this
102:23 - will make it much more readable and
102:25 - actually don't need the ID so I can take
102:26 - that out so this is all I need
102:28 - so we are done all right so this is
102:30 - follow now I'm going to show you
102:33 - something in the next video I think I'm
102:36 - going to take a break and in the next
102:38 - video I'm going to look for messages
102:41 - that app mention the bot and then I'm
102:42 - gonna have that bot act on those either
102:44 - reply to them or favor it or do
102:46 - something like that okay so that's what
102:47 - I'm gonna do next
102:49 - [Music]
103:04 - someone just mention okay all right I'm
103:08 - missing a semicolon there we go thank
103:11 - you okay
103:29 - okay
103:39 - what's this delete message favorite
103:44 - we're gonna how I get a minute I want to
103:47 - mention oh here we go type mention okay
103:49 - great okay okay every now we look over
104:03 - the chat it's a message about c-sharp
104:05 - versus C++ Python Java you think
104:10 - everybody's watching a completely
104:12 - different live stream it's not me on it
104:15 - okay okay
104:25 - I'm back again oh so many mastodons
104:27 - videos this now what I want to do is
104:29 - look at how I can deal with a mention a
104:33 - mention is when somebody else
104:35 - toots posts and mentions me the bots in
104:39 - their message post so and this will come
104:42 - in as a notification event type
104:45 - mentioned before I dealt with if I look
104:49 - at my code in the previous video I dealt
104:52 - with anything that is a follow so now I
104:55 - want to say else if message data type
104:59 - equals for a mention so I want to deal
105:04 - with a mention so what I'm going to do
105:06 - in this example is if somebody says
105:10 - please like or favorite or something
105:13 - like that I will like or favorite if
105:15 - someone says please boost or reblog I
105:17 - will boost slash reblog so I'm actually
105:19 - gonna spa I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
105:21 - toot back but I'm going to act on the
105:23 - message based on what the content is so
105:25 - the first thing that I would might want
105:27 - to do is I could use a regular
105:28 - expression so for example I could say
105:33 - regular expression one is and if you
105:36 - don't know about writing expressions I'd
105:37 - refer you to my session on regular
105:39 - expressions if if like or favorite or
105:46 - maybe the hearts emoji how do I get
105:49 - emoji
105:50 - hold on there's a way to do the emoji
105:53 - keyboard no how do I get it on that with
106:01 - the touch bar can I just get the touch
106:03 - bar - no wow that's weird
106:08 - hold on emoji touch bar mac how do I
106:23 - like make it happen
106:28 - this is really good useful oh if I do
106:33 - something like this will it just pop up
106:37 - no because it's got to be like in email
106:41 - or something
106:51 - stupid Dutch bar
107:07 - okay Mac whoa gee keyboard command
107:17 - control spacebar that's what I was
107:19 - looking for
107:20 - no hey there we go okay there we go oh
107:29 - yeah all right all right can make this
107:37 - regular expression I can say like or
107:41 - favorite or like maybe if somebody uses
107:46 - a heart I don't know is this the regular
107:49 - heart
107:50 - this is the regular heart I think I
107:52 - think so now I basically want to look so
107:55 - what is the content so I need to look at
107:59 - this is the mention I want to look at
108:01 - the data data dot status dot content
108:07 - okay so I need to say content equals
108:13 - equals data
108:16 - status content and I want to say if
108:21 - regular expression test content so I'm
108:25 - pretty sure this is a function that if I
108:27 - have a regular expression if the regular
108:30 - expression is match somewhere within
108:32 - that string content this will return
108:34 - true so if that's the case I want to say
108:39 - m dot post m dot posts and then what so
108:46 - I need to go back and look at the API
108:48 - documentation because I want to favorite
108:49 - it so if I go back here and say look I'm
108:52 - favorite the the the pack to favorite is
108:58 - statuses the ID and favorite so I need
109:02 - to say post to and so this is what I was
109:07 - doing when I want to post something I
109:09 - would actually just say statuses slash
109:14 - and I want to make this a template
109:16 - literal once again I need to put the ID
109:18 - in here fav
109:21 - it okay so this is me if it matches
109:24 - favourite it and then I need to get the
109:26 - ID so the ID is under data status ID
109:31 - that's perfect data status ID and then
109:35 - there are any parameters that I need
109:37 - here so I can just go straight to the
109:40 - callback error data and I can make a
109:47 - little function here and I can say you
109:50 - know if error console log console error
109:53 - error else console.log favorited and
110:03 - presumably this is going to look a lot
110:06 - like this I would imagine favorited ID
110:09 - so let me just do data dot ID I'm
110:12 - guessing so just to like have a little
110:15 - more information in here favorited data
110:22 - dot and by the way this is message
110:26 - message dot data message data and this
110:30 - is favorited data ID okay so let's see
110:35 - here what's go what's wrong something is
110:38 - terribly wrong I have I'm out of whack
110:40 - in terms of my brackets and things so oh
110:44 - this also needs a end tick there we go
110:47 - and now a semicolon okay so apologies
110:49 - that this is hard to see here let me see
110:51 - if I can remove this over give myself a
110:54 - little bit more space so we can look at
110:55 - this code okay let me just make the font
111:02 - a little bit smaller there we go okay so
111:06 - what we're looking at here is if if it's
111:09 - a follow we're just going to say thanks
111:11 - for the follow if it's a mention we're
111:13 - gonna see did the mention use the word
111:15 - like favorite or heart if it did
111:18 - favorite it and then give me some
111:21 - information about whether it worked or
111:22 - not
111:22 - so probably I also should do something
111:25 - like say console dot log just in case
111:30 - them just so I can see what them the
111:32 - message has
111:34 - I'm gonna say console dot log a mention
111:39 - ID and then add content okay we are
111:46 - gonna run this whoo oh yeah what did I
111:49 - lose something weird happened here
111:51 - I also need this oh boy
111:55 - template literal come back we tried to
111:59 - reform out all this stuff
112:01 - oh so sad hold on we're gonna get this
112:08 - back there we go okay we're good again
112:11 - there we go here's our code we got it if
112:13 - you mentioned me check to see if you
112:15 - said like favorite or heart and if so I
112:17 - am going to favorite it all right here
112:21 - we go let's run this bot see if we have
112:23 - any errors okay it's starting all right
112:26 - better start mentioning me try
112:29 - mentioning me with with a heart with a
112:33 - like with saying favorite or not I will
112:38 - just wait whoa what's going on this is
112:44 - right ah
112:45 - [Music]
112:47 - something bad is happening so okay
112:54 - my console logging is crazy Oh what
112:58 - happened here did I put a breakpoint in
113:00 - by accident I did not mean to do that
113:12 - and what is going on okay hold on all
113:15 - right I got some weird errors here am I
113:20 - getting an error favourited undefined
113:27 - hold on stop everybody well well first
113:41 - let me see if this is working
113:50 - yes it doesn't look like it doesn't look
113:57 - like I am favoriting this so something
114:01 - definitely went wrong and what is this
114:06 - crazy console.log it's coming out here
114:13 - we've got to debug this without me with
114:15 - with some actual mention ID contents oh
114:23 - is that coming out mention id content
114:34 - then I'm getting favorited undefined and
114:38 - what is this insanity
114:40 - oh it's though something horrible
114:48 - happened Oh because when I got my when I
114:52 - oughta fold on
115:06 - this is ridiculously annoying this
115:16 - shouldn't ever be happening
115:25 - how is this oh because this is a no it's
115:40 - favored in the docks with the you yeah
115:48 - but why is this happening just run this
115:52 - one more time
116:00 - I'm waiting for somebody to mention me
116:02 - again
116:12 - my first second I thought I froze it's
116:17 - nice that the stream didn't freeze today
116:20 - alright mention okay your mention this
116:26 - mentioned me oh there was heart there
116:31 - try mentioning me with with like with
116:35 - just a word like line 38 at oh so
116:40 - favorites what's wrong
116:41 - it's I need to be with a you that's
116:44 - interesting okay
116:45 - I love kittens I didn't use a love
116:50 - favorite oh and I didn't use I for okay
116:54 - great so this one tried to I like
116:58 - turtles but it's not gonna work okay
116:59 - great
117:05 - okay alright
117:12 - okay so by the way weird awkward edit
117:15 - point because it didn't work and some
117:18 - weird stuff happened but I am now
117:20 - discovered through the thankful helpful
117:22 - people in the chat that I have a few
117:23 - errors here so number one is let's go
117:26 - back to the API for a second and we can
117:29 - see here that I didn't pay close
117:30 - attention it's actually spelled with a u
117:32 - here I D favorite so this seems kind of
117:35 - important that I spelled correctly so
117:37 - let me fix that here oh but that's not
117:39 - actually the important place the
117:40 - important place is here and then a
117:43 - couple other things I want to use a flag
117:46 - for I for for a case insensitivity in
117:51 - other words you can also the you should
117:53 - be optional here that doesn't really
117:55 - matter so u is optional so you can say
117:57 - like favor it I don't still not sure if
117:59 - this is the right kind of heart that
118:01 - normally but now this should fix that
118:03 - that I should now actually be favoriting
118:07 - things so we're gonna try this again I'm
118:09 - gonna go back to here and I'm gonna run
118:11 - this bot again and I'm gonna wait
118:15 - [Music]
118:21 - Oh lime 38 something's telling me what's
118:37 - wrong with line 38 no I want the ID of
118:50 - the thing of of this event oh I see oh
118:58 - [Music]
119:03 - look so this appears to be working okay
119:14 - so we can see oh oh
119:16 - why are my settings not being retained
119:19 - on this computer all right
119:25 - just give me a second here where is that
119:29 - thing where it doesn't uh yes here we go
119:31 - okay
119:40 - all right so okay I'm back a lot of
119:45 - people mentioned me let's go take a look
119:47 - at the actual timeline we and we could
119:50 - see that it is favoriting and we are
119:52 - getting an ID out you can see that this
119:54 - idea is different than this ID and some
119:56 - people are asking about that I will I
119:57 - will let me mention that in the chat in
119:59 - a second in a second but let me go here
120:01 - so you're my favorite mmm how come it
120:06 - didn't ah there we go
120:08 - I just had to refresh so we could see
120:10 - this got favored it because it has
120:12 - favorite in it this got favored because
120:13 - it has a heart this got favored because
120:16 - as the word like I'm looking for one
120:18 - that doesn't have oh this must have been
120:21 - from a while ago and it wasn't working
120:22 - but we can see here now please like
120:25 - please clap
120:26 - so please mention me without using like
120:31 - favorite or heart to make sure that also
120:32 - works
120:49 - I'm just gonna wait this Alette will
120:50 - edit this waiting part out it's 4:30
121:09 - okay I'm back and we can see here that K
121:12 - week Mon wrote coding book train bought
121:15 - choo-choo and if i refresh this page it
121:17 - was not favorited so it is working only
121:20 - now it should be only if and if I go
121:24 - back to the code only if this regular
121:27 - expression matches will I favorite
121:29 - alright
121:30 - and by the way we could really quickly
121:31 - now just also like there's probably a
121:33 - nicer way to do this but I'm just going
121:35 - to really quickly like copy paste this
121:37 - whole thing and I'm gonna say
121:39 - boost or reblog or or retweet even or
121:48 - let's get another emoji in here control
121:51 - option let's see if you use a a train
121:54 - emoji or if you use the train emoji then
121:58 - we will reblog so now if I fight quickly
122:03 - run this again I'll make this reg x2 if
122:07 - reg x2 and I don't need to I don't need
122:13 - to get the content or the ID anymore and
122:16 - I don't need this again I'm so now this
122:19 - is just and I probably it probably makes
122:20 - sense for me to actually put this up
122:23 - actually you know they could both happen
122:24 - so here now I this will boost anyone
122:28 - that says boost reblog retweet or the
122:31 - train and and Miller mentioning this is
122:33 - a mistake here so this data ID this is
122:37 - actually this is the ID of this the
122:41 - actual favorited action which everything
122:44 - every action has an ID so if I if
122:46 - somebody messages that mention has an ID
122:49 - which I captured up here so but this is
122:52 - the ID of the actual act of favoriting
122:54 - it so I don't know debugging wise I
122:56 - don't know what's more important to
122:57 - display I could display both of them but
123:01 - you'll see those are two different
123:02 - things and this should say reblogged and
123:04 - this should say favorited so let's now
123:11 - do this and here we go everybody you can
123:17 - now ask to be favorited or rebo
123:21 - [Music]
123:46 - [Music]
123:52 - all right a lot of mentions came in you
123:56 - can see some things are being favored at
123:57 - it and reblogged some things are just
123:59 - being reblogged let's go take a look at
124:01 - the timeline and let's look at this
124:07 - did you know mm-hmm I don't oh yeah I
124:10 - love trains this got boosted coding
124:14 - trained bots that got boosted and this
124:17 - one reblog this I want the followers
124:19 - like it too and we got both a reblog and
124:22 - a like okay so this works we now have a
124:27 - bot that had that both that just checks
124:31 - for follows mentions and follows and
124:36 - mentions if somebody follows it toots
124:39 - back welcome aboard to that account and
124:41 - if somebody mentions and uses any of
124:45 - these keywords and either favorites or
124:47 - reblogs so the thing that I didn't do
124:49 - which I which I should add to this I
124:50 - guess I'll to know if it really makes
124:52 - sense to just keep doing more videos
124:54 - about this but yeah I'll do another
124:57 - video where I'll add this but you might
124:58 - want to try this as an exercise what how
125:00 - what about actually replying what about
125:02 - posting an actual reply back to the
125:04 - person so if the person asks what is the
125:07 - meaning of life then the bot replies
125:10 - with a random number or something like
125:12 - that okay so give that a try I'll add
125:14 - that but I'll do that in the next video
125:15 - okay goodbye
125:24 - all right I'm gonna go but I'm gonna
125:27 - just finish off this last little piece
125:36 - so let's see
125:48 - [Music]
125:57 - it really should go I'm just so amazed
126:00 - that this hasn't crashed I was really
126:03 - expecting the stream to crash especially
126:04 - cuz of the word beeping happened who
126:06 - knows who knows all right
126:12 - I'm kidding a lot of mentions alright
126:15 - let's let's just finish this off let's
126:18 - do this last one that's awesome okay
126:32 - thank you
126:33 - terney KH for this alright here we go
126:45 - hello welcome to video number seven
126:48 - thousand six hundred and twenty nine
126:49 - about mastodons Potts I have been on a
126:52 - journey a journey to come along the
126:55 - tracks of Mastodon and I have I started
126:59 - from nowhere and I have arrived to the
127:01 - point where I have a box
127:02 - it's called coding train bot and what
127:04 - this bot does if you follow the bots it
127:07 - says on the board and if you toot at the
127:10 - bot and use a certain keyword favorite
127:13 - or read toot boost whatever it is your
127:16 - particular post and I want to add one
127:19 - more thing to it so I want to be able to
127:22 - respond to a question so let's just say
127:26 - I'm gonna look for any post at me that
127:29 - ends with a question mark this is gonna
127:31 - be tricky because there's the HTML tags
127:33 - in it I'm just gonna look for a question
127:35 - mark I'll let you make this fancier so
127:37 - let's add one more check I'm going to
127:44 - constant reg x3 I'm just gonna look for
127:48 - a question mark so question mark is a
127:51 - meta character so I think I might have
127:53 - to do this back slash question mark or
127:57 - so I want to look for a question mark if
128:01 - reg x3 matches the content
128:07 - and by the way this is but this is by
128:10 - the way the how
128:11 - this is like the very basics of making a
128:13 - chatbot which is just doing like it
128:15 - basic pattern matching um you know now
128:18 - chat chat box systems use machine
128:20 - learning and try to category categorize
128:22 - what people are saying into intense and
128:24 - do all sort of text analysis but it is a
128:26 - core level you could just use regular
128:29 - expressions trying to match with
128:30 - somebody saying and respond accordingly
128:32 - and if you I do have a set of videos
128:34 - about rive script which is a pattern
128:36 - matching utility that you can use it any
128:39 - programming a number of programming
128:40 - languages but you can use it in
128:41 - JavaScript to build your own chat BOTS
128:42 - so this is you know interesting to think
128:44 - about what what what do you want your
128:46 - bot to actually do but in this case I'm
128:49 - just gonna use regular pressure I'm
128:50 - gonna look for a question mark so let me
128:52 - just actually make sure this works I'm
128:55 - gonna say I got a question and let me
128:58 - look at the content so I think I'm gonna
129:02 - not always console.log the content
129:06 - anymore I know that's working so I just
129:09 - want to now I want to just look at it
129:10 - console.log data what was it called did
129:14 - I put it in a variable content so I'm
129:16 - just gonna look at the content so I am
129:19 - now going to run this you know by the
129:21 - way if you're doing this on your own
129:23 - you're gonna want to have a second
129:24 - Mastodon account where you can then test
129:26 - it I am struck with a weird crazy person
129:29 - who does the sort of stuff on a live
129:30 - stream you apparently I just assume that
129:32 - though people out in the world watching
129:34 - well interact and hopefully be kind okay
129:38 - now let us run it again let's see if we
129:41 - can get some mentions with a question
129:44 - mark in them and see if oh there we go
129:48 - okay so I got a question okay ooh that's
129:51 - interesting
129:51 - oh I got a question oh that's not what
129:55 - somebody who said to me why with a brush
129:57 - mark okay so that seems to be working so
129:59 - I'm gonna assume that that's good thank
130:00 - you for that and now what I want to do
130:03 - is I want to say I want to I want to do
130:07 - i want to create sorry a reply so I'm
130:13 - gonna say a reply equals the meaning of
130:18 - life is and I'm going to use this this
130:22 - oh I have this from before by accident
130:23 - luckily
130:25 - is numb but and then I want to just send
130:31 - that reply but here's the thing
130:34 - a couple things one is I want to mention
130:35 - that person so I did that before when
130:39 - somebody followed me so I can do at and
130:41 - then the account which I should still
130:43 - have hmm I didn't actually save the
130:46 - account so if somebody mentions me where
130:49 - do I get the account data account
130:52 - accounts the same thing so I can
130:55 - actually go back message data account I
130:57 - actually I think I kind of like always
130:59 - want this so whether it is a follow or a
131:03 - mention to whoops
131:04 - so I'm going to put this out here so I
131:07 - have access to that account sorry that
131:09 - the font got smaller here hopefully can
131:11 - still read it so I want to first mention
131:15 - that account and then say that but but
131:20 - here's the thing you can mention but
131:23 - it's not going to actually understand it
131:25 - as a threaded reply unless I include in
131:29 - reply to ID so I actually also need to
131:33 - get the ID which I have here message
131:37 - data status ID so what I'm going to do
131:40 - is I'm going to over load this function
131:43 - with a second argument ID and I'm going
131:46 - to say in reply to we got a look at the
131:51 - documentation I don't remember what it
131:52 - is but if I look here oh it's actually
131:56 - under over here in reply to or reply to
132:00 - oh no I'm in the wrong place
132:04 - I'm totally in the wrong but I was in
132:06 - the right place before in reply there we
132:08 - go I'm looking for in reply to ID so I
132:12 - want to grab this and I want to put this
132:14 - here and then I want to put in the ID
132:18 - and I guess what I want to do is the
132:21 - thing is I'm gonna do it this this is a
132:24 - little goofy there's probably could use
132:25 - some fancy ternary operator or something
132:27 - but I'm just gonna say if ID exists then
132:33 - I'm going to add it cramsey in reply to
132:35 - ID equals ID so it's not gonna it's all
132:38 - it's big
132:38 - whether or not if I send into this
132:41 - function I'm always going to send in
132:43 - this function some content that I want
132:45 - to toot but if there's an ID I also want
132:48 - to add that in so now we should be good
132:52 - if somebody asks a question we are now
132:54 - replying with at that person oh and this
132:57 - should have an @ @ that person did I do
133:01 - that up here when I yes @ account so at
133:06 - account the meaning of life is and then
133:07 - the number okay here we go let's
133:10 - actually run this you can now ask me
133:12 - your questions and I will wait
133:16 - [Music]
133:34 - alright I'm back and a bunch of people
133:36 - are at least two I got two mentions so
133:39 - if I go back now and look at my bots
133:43 - account hopefully it's not too spammy
133:45 - are you for real and then we look at
133:48 - this we can see the meaning of life is
133:50 - 40 and this one has a question like this
133:54 - yes we can see the meaning of life is 65
133:57 - and I'm just curious if somebody was
133:59 - looking for one that also has the so
134:02 - this one for example some fake Dan
134:05 - Schiffman this one was both favorited
134:10 - and boosted and replied too so this bot
134:13 - will actually do all of the things it is
134:15 - now about oh look at this I'm just gonna
134:19 - favor this manually by the way everyone
134:21 - should look at Alka aníbal Lisa's room
134:23 - table it's wonderful I am will be
134:26 - releasing my ELISA Zhu coding challenge
134:28 - video very soon and here you go so this
134:32 - is it we have now finished this up we
134:34 - now have made a bot we've seen how a bot
134:36 - can post periodically with set interval
134:39 - something and you might come up with an
134:41 - idea of what you want to do we have now
134:43 - seen how a bot can favorite or boost
134:46 - things and reply to things so now it's
134:49 - time for you to be creative what kinds
134:51 - of replies what kinds of activity maybe
134:54 - you have a bot that makes up a poem I
134:57 - haven't shown you how to generate an
134:58 - image and post it so I will show you
135:00 - that I've got to make a video to show
135:02 - you how to do that but there's all sorts
135:03 - of wonderful possibilities of how you
135:05 - can make your automated bot use it on
135:07 - mastodons at BOTS in space okay so choo
135:10 - choo everybody see you in a future video
135:13 - I hope you enjoyed this series about
135:15 - making a mastadon bot more to come in
135:18 - the future I I'm sure goodbye
135:22 - alright
135:32 - come on come back yeah an undefined one
135:40 - would probably that probably would be
135:42 - fine
135:44 - a me IM semi made a good point i imagine
135:47 - an undefined and reply to ID would be
135:50 - allowed to mean there isn't one so i
135:52 - probably didn't need that extra step but
135:53 - i did do it alright so i this bot is i
135:59 - wonder if i should deploy this spot
136:00 - somewhere so that people who watch the
136:05 - videos can interact with it but it hit
136:08 - 42 where where where where where oh
136:15 - there we go
136:25 - so my desktop there we go there we go
136:45 - okay
136:48 - all right everyone this by the way if is
136:50 - my I am now on Mastodon at Schiffman at
136:57 - choo-choo dot space again unfortunately
137:00 - right now I am leaving choo-choo dot
137:03 - space closed for YouTube members or
137:06 - patrons and I would gladly open that up
137:14 - sorry open that up if if it makes sense
137:17 - to do that at some point alright anyone
137:19 - have any questions I want to ask I think
137:21 - I'm finished for today it's almost 5
137:23 - o'clock you could deploy it on the same
137:26 - box choo choo dot space instances on
137:28 - exactly that's what I'll do we mentioned
137:29 - do that real quick right now I'm afraid
137:33 - to log into that instance ever alright
137:38 - anybody any anything else to say to do
137:42 - to wonder oh let me mention let me do
137:45 - something right now
137:47 - because I have so many videos now I'm
137:50 - gonna go here most recently this style
137:55 - transfer video posted let me go here and
138:00 - post the next one so I would love people
138:03 - to try out the style transfer thing and
138:05 - see if you're able to follow it
138:08 - so the second style transfer video part
138:13 - 2 let me just check this to make sure
138:18 - [Music]
138:23 - I'm going to post that one now so in a
138:28 - moment I'm releasing I don't have the
138:31 - YouTube premiere thing unlocked and Mike
138:33 - I really want to get that unlocked in my
138:35 - account because I think would be fun to
138:37 - interact live the first time a video
138:38 - post it even though it's like the second
138:40 - time it's just in a live stream but you
138:42 - know so I'm gonna set part to public and
138:46 - I'm gonna say actions public I
138:50 - understand that I can't undo and now we
138:55 - should see here just released on the
138:57 - channel pending nope come on YouTube
139:11 - Eitan asked will you explain how style
139:13 - transfer works in more technical terms
139:15 - if you are interested in that you should
139:17 - check out and let me let me show you
139:19 - where to find this I don't know why it's
139:26 - like taking a million years to set this
139:28 - video to public it's kind of ridiculous
139:31 - oh it was successful so now part two
139:39 - should well hold on let me just you know
139:42 - it'll appear eventually I'm gonna go to
139:43 - playlists on my channel and I'm going to
139:47 - go to this one and here so this is the
139:55 - full playlist right now of the machine
139:58 - learning videos using the spell platform
140:01 - and this is my introduction to the spell
140:05 - platform this is the style transfer
140:08 - video of how to train your model so I'll
140:10 - transfer model and this is the style
140:12 - transfer video how to actually run the
140:14 - style transfer model in the browser with
140:16 - ml 5 j s which runs on top of tetra
140:18 - fluro chess but um Eitan and the chat
140:21 - had asked about explaining style
140:25 - transfer in more detail I would refer
140:28 - you to so both of these you can see this
140:30 - is about 50 minutes these are edited out
140:32 - of the 1-hour 26 minute livestream just
140:35 - to give people sort of streamlined
140:36 - versions of the videos they just want to
140:38 - follow the tutorials but if I go to the
140:40 - live stream and if I go to the
140:46 - description sorry this is like well
140:51 - this is working now never forget that
140:53 - this dot t-shirt aisle we're factoring
140:55 - t-shirts and things if I go to the
141:01 - description is what I'm looking for show
141:03 - more yes this at four minutes and 28
141:06 - seconds this is where inning begins her
141:12 - presentation and in this presentation I
141:15 - can just put it quickly on like speed
141:18 - hold on speed two times so this is where
141:29 - she gives her presentation while she
141:30 - talks through the details behind what
141:33 - where style transfer comes from and how
141:34 - it technically works and how the
141:36 - training so all of the number one and
141:38 - two what does style transfer and how
141:40 - does it work you'll find here on numbers
141:42 - three and four have been edited into
141:43 - shorter videos okay so that's where you
141:45 - can find that information and please I'm
141:48 - really curious this is like high degree
141:50 - of difficulty stuff to like train a
141:52 - model to deploy training that my own to
141:54 - the cloud so they'd get the train model
141:56 - to run it in the browser if you're able
141:57 - to get it to work please share with me
142:00 - and let me know I know Twitter or
142:02 - mastered I guess I don't know where and
142:04 - if you're not able to get it to work let
142:07 - me know try to try to send a message
142:09 - post a comment we'll see if we can help
142:10 - you out to get it to work okay so that's
142:17 - it for today thank you everyone for
142:19 - watching I will be back up on Friday on
142:21 - Friday you will see if I go to youtube
142:27 - the coding train you will see that on
142:31 - Friday we will be doing another neural
142:34 - network machine learning training
142:36 - livestream this time at 11 a.m. Eastern
142:40 - I think that's when we set it for text
142:44 - generation so we're gonna use something
142:45 - called a long short-term memory Network
142:47 - training it on the cloud with a you can
142:50 - train it on a corpus of text and then
142:52 - run the model to have that that model
142:54 - generate new text in the same vein as
142:56 - what it's been trained on so that will
142:58 - be something that I will show and guess
143:01 - now Bo Husein will be here on Friday
143:03 - to show how to do that all right thank
143:06 - you everybody
143:06 - I will leave you thanks for tuning in to
143:13 - today's special coding train about
143:16 - mastodons and all that stuff hopefully
143:18 - you found this useful and interesting
143:20 - stay tuned
143:21 - hopefully maybe even tomorrow mom the
143:24 - Lisa's you coding challenge will come
143:26 - out and as always thanks for your
143:29 - support thanks for watching I hope
143:31 - you're finding this enjoyable and
143:33 - interesting and useful and if not that's
143:36 - okay too I would understand I always
143:43 - on Friday
143:45 - [Music]
143:48 - ah you know what I need I need a second

143:55 - it back and forth from home here home
143:56 - here so somebody recommend now that I
144:02 - know that I love the ukulele I don't
144:06 - know I bought like a cheapest one they
144:08 - had a Guitar Center
144:09 - so I'll take recommendations can I get
144:11 - like a coding train themed rainbow like
144:13 - ukulele maybe that's it all right
144:17 - was it a key MCU hack the bots that's
144:20 - great to hear good bye everybody
144:22 - [Music]
144:45 - yeah no green no green in the ukulele
144:47 - please
144:54 - [Music]
