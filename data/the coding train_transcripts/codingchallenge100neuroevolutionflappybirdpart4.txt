00:00 - hello and welcome to part 4 of the
00:05 - flappy bird neuro evolution coding
00:06 - challenge now you might have thought you
00:09 - might have watched part three and
00:10 - thought it's done finished coding
00:12 - challenge complete but I got so many
00:14 - excellent comments and suggestions about
00:16 - how to improve my neuro evolution
00:20 - simulation that I decided to come back
00:21 - and attempt a part for mmm this is part
00:24 - 4 so by the way and before I actually
00:27 - came back to attempt I did some work to
00:29 - test out some of these ideas and here
00:31 - you can see this is a version of it
00:33 - running with some of these improvements
00:34 - and you can see that I pretty much have
00:36 - a little bird here that has beaten the
00:38 - game as it stands alright so let me
00:41 - close this out I'm gonna go to this
00:43 - github issue where I kept track of some
00:46 - of the comments and put them here in a
00:48 - list so these are the things that I want
00:50 - to add to be honest I might do this last
00:51 - one in a part 5 but let's see LEDs at
00:54 - the very least what I want to do is
00:56 - apparently a very important feature of
00:58 - the game is that if the bird reaches the
01:00 - ceiling or the floor a point to the bird
01:03 - so I want to make sure to implement that
01:05 - there's an issue a bug in which the
01:08 - pipes by detection for the closest pipe
01:11 - I'm only detecting it up to the point
01:13 - where it reaches the bird itself and not
01:15 - as it passes it and that sort of causing
01:17 - some issues as well as oh my goodness
01:20 - why velocity I mean let's think about
01:23 - this for a second I have this diagram
01:25 - over here right if this is my bird and
01:29 - this is the gap approaching right what
01:35 - if the bird is already moving up or what
01:37 - if the bird is following that falling
01:39 - down this would make a very big
01:41 - difference in whether I should jump or
01:43 - not because if I'm moving up jumping
01:46 - might cause me to hit the top the the
01:49 - top part of the pipe so I shouldn't jump
01:51 - but if I don't jump while I'm moving
01:52 - down I'll probably hit the bottom so
01:54 - having Y velocity whether I'm already
01:57 - moving up or down as part of the inputs
01:59 - into the system is going to create a
02:01 - much smarter bird and it makes sense
02:02 - that a bird playing the game would know
02:04 - if it's moving up or down so I feel like
02:06 - that's a fair input so let's go and add
02:08 - those things so first let's go with
02:10 - adding the Y velocity vers order
02:13 - let's go with adding the Y velocity as
02:15 - an input that's Prince of the actual
02:18 - algorithm that's going on here go back
02:19 - to my code zoom beckon I'm gonna go to
02:22 - the bird the bird as you recall has a
02:25 - brain so the brain previously had four
02:28 - inputs top and bottom of the pipe
02:32 - exposition of the pipe Y position of the
02:34 - bird now I want five inputs and I don't
02:37 - know let's increase the number of hidden
02:39 - neurons to make it a bit more
02:40 - sophisticated I like a sophisticated
02:42 - bird now then we're gonna go down and
02:45 - we're going to look here aha
02:48 - these are the inputs the Y location the
02:50 - top the bottom the X location all
02:52 - normalized to arrange between zero and
02:53 - one so now all I need to say is that
02:58 - this dot velocity let's make that an
03:03 - input now this is a bit interesting here
03:05 - now let me just make sure that's the
03:06 - variable right this dot velocity now
03:08 - here's the thing when I wanted to when I
03:10 - use something like the exposition as an
03:13 - input or the Y position there's a
03:15 - distinct right there's a distinct way to
03:19 - normalize that value to arrange between
03:21 - zero and one the Y values go between
03:24 - zero and four eighty divided by four
03:25 - eighty I have a number between zero and
03:26 - one but the velocity is a bit more
03:28 - mysterious first of all it could be
03:29 - negative it could be positive what
03:31 - should I really do here let's try
03:36 - something arbitrary let me try dividing
03:38 - by nineteen no ten so you know in the
03:40 - end I just need an input maybe it's okay
03:42 - if it's also negative I want it within
03:44 - kind of like a smallish range but I
03:46 - think if I divide it by something that's
03:48 - probably gonna do just fine oh and this
03:51 - should be input for so in that sense I
03:54 - now if I go back and run it I should
03:58 - have already a smarter bird so let's let
04:01 - this run for a little while
04:03 - let's train it for a little while and we
04:05 - can see oh yeah this is the number of
04:09 - generations I've gotten up to seven
04:11 - because it's already kind of pretty
04:12 - smart let's slow it down and we can see
04:15 - we can see there it is figuring it sort
04:19 - of figured it out all right well this
04:20 - some things are a bit different from
04:22 - this and the other version but you can
04:23 - see that adding that Y velocity has
04:24 - already probably improved it okay so the
04:27 - neck
04:27 - feature I would like to implement now
04:29 - that we've added Y velocity is let's try
04:32 - fixing the pipes closest detection so
04:35 - let me explain what's wrong so if this
04:39 - is the bird and this is the pipe and
04:42 - this is another pipe I have an algorithm
04:46 - that says oh hey this is the one I
04:48 - should look at but if there happens to
04:50 - be another pipe over here that's
04:52 - technically closer I want to ignore it
04:54 - because I only care about the pipes that
04:55 - are in front of me
04:56 - but still it's there on this in the
04:58 - canvas because it's part of the
05:00 - animation so I have an algorithm that
05:01 - already deals with that but
05:03 - unfortunately right as soon as the if
05:06 - the pipe is here it's still gonna read
05:07 - as the closest but if it's actually like
05:10 - here right above it as soon as the front
05:12 - of the pipe passes the bird it's gonna
05:16 - ignore that pipe and so if it sees
05:18 - another one coming it's got to go up it
05:20 - could kind of get it should really still
05:22 - consider that pipe it should consider
05:24 - that pipe all the way until the back of
05:25 - it passes I think this is gonna be an
05:27 - easy thing to fix so let's go to touch
05:30 - it to do and find this part of the code
05:33 - yes that's what I'm doing in bird bird
05:39 - somewhere in here in think this is me
05:43 - finding the closest pipe and as long as
05:46 - the distance between the pipes X
05:49 - location and my location is positive
05:53 - that's something that I want to look at
05:54 - but let me actually just find the
05:56 - distance in the back of the pipe oh this
05:57 - is so easy
05:58 - pipes dot X plus pipe W so that that W
06:06 - is the width of the pipe so I should be
06:08 - a plus pipes index I dot W minus this X
06:16 - so this should now work this is actually
06:18 - the location that I'm looking for which
06:20 - is behind the pipe wonderful all right
06:21 - do I even want to run it again do I care
06:24 - let's run it again
06:25 - well let's speed it up to train for a
06:27 - little while
06:30 - [Music]
06:38 - and there we go and let's just let's
06:42 - still run we could see there we go oh
06:44 - poor poor little flappy bird lost the
06:47 - game alright so now what else do we have
06:49 - to do I go back to my list
06:52 - we now ah fix when the bird hits the
06:57 - bottom now I'm told by the chat that
07:00 - actually in the original game hitting
07:02 - the ceiling is allowed so let's only add
07:04 - the bottom I guess so if I go into the
07:10 - bird there is a function called I
07:15 - believe well there isn't actually so
07:21 - hold on a second let's go to the sketch
07:23 - I've forgotten how my code works
07:24 - completely and let's go and see here ah
07:28 - all right so this is the loop where I
07:30 - remove birds but the problem is this
07:34 - loop is inside the pipes so do I really
07:38 - want to remove a bird here I mean I
07:40 - don't know what the best way of doing
07:42 - this is but what I'm going to do is I'm
07:44 - just gonna create another little quick
07:46 - check down here I'm gonna use I and I'm
07:52 - gonna say if birds index I what should I
08:00 - say off screen off screen then here is
08:05 - another reason why I might want to
08:07 - remove that particular bird and put it
08:10 - into my saved Birds array which was
08:12 - admittedly a bit of a silly solution but
08:14 - it works so I need to write a function
08:16 - here in bird which is called off-screen
08:19 - and I'm just going to return return this
08:23 - dot y is greater than height or this dot
08:27 - well I can't resist having it die if it
08:30 - hits the ceiling I cannot resist let's
08:32 - just add that for a second off-screen so
08:35 - let's see if this works and let's do
08:38 - this so look there at the bot ha you
08:41 - know what there's an issue here I think
08:43 - somewhere in here
08:44 - right I had this extra code to constrain
08:47 - them within the screen which is sort of
08:49 - silly and now I can remove that they
08:52 - don't get constrained they just die so
08:55 - you can see they're hitting the bottom
08:56 - they're dying
08:56 - so now let's speed this up and let's let
08:59 - this go I'll be back in a minute okay I
09:12 - have returned looks like we've got a
09:14 - pretty good one here that doesn't seem
09:16 - to have any problem beating this game
09:18 - lovely look at you go look at you you
09:20 - scrappy little bird flapping your way
09:23 - through this course beautiful so I think
09:25 - we've made some pretty good improvements
09:27 - here I don't know let's make the game a
09:30 - little bit harder just to see so what
09:34 - did we have now in pipe oh the spacing
09:37 - is 175 that is way too easy so let's
09:40 - make it 125 and let's give a little
09:43 - refresh here and I will be back again in
09:46 - a minute
09:47 - [Music]
09:57 - alright I've returned this bird looks
09:59 - pretty pretty pretty good let's see how
10:02 - it's doing here yep doesn't seem to have
10:03 - any problem with this one 25 spacing
10:07 - what do you think can we push it a
10:09 - little just 75 80 50 I don't know let's
10:15 - try flip a coin whoa look at that look
10:20 - at it go oh it's such a good little bird
10:21 - there all right oh this is a bad idea 75
10:25 - it's gonna be way too hard all right
10:35 - dare I say that it's working it's hard
10:37 - to tell whether it's so sped up let's
10:38 - actually slow down there's actually two
10:40 - of them going oh my goodness oh there's
10:42 - a bunch of them in there
10:42 - let's just let's let's look at it at a
10:45 - more yeah seems pretty reasonable to me
10:54 - all right so this is pretty exciting to
10:57 - see you know I probably again I don't
10:59 - have the exact physics of the original
11:01 - game so that probably could be some
11:02 - tweaks there but as you can see just
11:04 - really that Y velocity if I take the out
11:07 - that Y velocity input well let me just
11:09 - say I think the Y velocity is probably
11:10 - the most important fix that we made so I
11:12 - can really quickly just in the bird
11:14 - itself I can just let me just set the Y
11:17 - velocity to zero so basically it's not
11:19 - getting it anymore it's as if it's a
11:21 - constant input so it's sort of become
11:23 - irrelevant I don't think it's going to
11:25 - be able to solve this now so let me give
11:27 - it a little bit of a run here for a few
11:29 - minutes all right so I've let this run
11:35 - for a while but you can see like it's
11:37 - just like it's all over the place it's
11:40 - not able to sort of fit itself through
11:41 - these pipes there there is a good point
11:44 - in the chat that I am probably with that
11:46 - then I haven't really debate this sort
11:48 - of amount that it jumps very very low so
11:51 - it's able to kind of like perfectly
11:52 - position it's almost as if it's just
11:53 - like finding the exact spot so you know
11:57 - one thing I might just try let's put it
11:59 - back let's put the velocity back let's
12:01 - make it a little bit harder for the bird
12:03 - let's give it a bit more of
12:05 - powerful jump let's give it sixteen
12:08 - instead of twelve this will make it a
12:10 - harder game for it to play I think but
12:13 - let's see if we can do it so you can see
12:21 - I don't know it's my hit detection looks
12:23 - like it might be a little bit generous I
12:26 - think that collision detection is a
12:28 - little bit generous you can see I don't
12:30 - know that maybe maybe the lift okay
12:36 - so I'm being told there's a very
12:37 - important feature which is that if it's
12:40 - moving up it cannot jump it can only
12:44 - jump if it's moving down so let's see if
12:47 - we can add that oh boy I did not know
12:50 - that was the case so the way that I
12:53 - would add that is this is where it
12:56 - chooses to jump up and so I suppose I
13:02 - mean I guess it just I might as well
13:03 - render the decision irrelevant right so
13:06 - and if output 0 is greater than output 1
13:11 - and this dot velocity is moving down
13:18 - which means greater than or equal to
13:20 - zero okay so I'm allowed I'm not allowed
13:24 - to go up unless I'm already going up
13:25 - let's try it and let's let me just for
13:28 - the sake of argument let me put this
13:29 - back to the the pipe distance let me put
13:32 - that back to 100 this was gonna be such
13:35 - a short video now it's so long and let
13:37 - me speed this up and I shall return
13:42 - [Music]
13:47 - all right there's some interesting
13:48 - discussion now in the chat as to whether
13:50 - that's actually a feature of the game
13:52 - but I did implement it and I'm only
13:54 - letting it jump while it's moving down
13:56 - and it still seems to be able to kind of
13:58 - get through these which is pretty cool
13:59 - to see I do kind of like the quality of
14:01 - it right now
14:02 - of what it's what it looks like so
14:04 - that's kind of cool all right so who
14:07 - knows I'm going to take that feature out
14:08 - because apparently that there's it's
14:11 - unclear as to whether that's actually a
14:13 - feature of the game I don't feel like
14:15 - that needs to necessarily be a feature
14:17 - of the simulation but I will leave it in
14:20 - as a comment in case anyone wants to
14:24 - reference it alright so now I feel like
14:28 - this is in good shape but what I want to
14:30 - be able to do right what I want to be
14:32 - able to do is let's say I mean this
14:34 - isn't a very complex problem I'm able to
14:36 - kind of like train a bird to play the
14:37 - game very well very quickly but if I had
14:40 - something that took a really long time
14:42 - to train I would want to be able to save
14:44 - the model and buy the model I mean a
14:46 - copy of all of the parameters and values
14:49 - and weights and variables and things
14:51 - that are in that bird's neural network
14:53 - brain I want to save a copy of that so
14:56 - that I could load that later and luckily
14:59 - for us there's a nice way of doing that
15:01 - so that will come in part no it won't be
15:04 - part five oh there's a part five coding
15:06 - challenge see you there
15:14 - [Music]
