00:00 - Right now in this very video
00:01 - We are going to dive into the nuts and bolts and
00:03 - Details of object-oriented programming. we're going to look at the syntax for writing an object in
00:09 - Our main program and we're going to look at the syntax for how we define a class.
00:14 - How it is we define the template the thing that will allow us to make objects. So what are we... we had this bouncing ball
00:20 - I'm tired of that stupid bouncing ball
00:23 - Not that the one I'm about to show you is really that much better, But
00:26 - We're going to do something slightly a little bit different; We've got a bubble
00:29 - We're going to think about making bubble objects.
00:31 - Come on..
00:33 - Computer
00:35 - We have a bubble here is our little circle. It's floating up to the top of the screen. It's going to get to the top
00:41 - It's going to stop so what do we have we wrote this program. It's much like the bouncing ball program
00:47 - It's just got a bunch of functions. It has display, ascend, top. Display draws
00:51 - it, ascend makes it move up, top checks to see if it's at the top and causes it to stop. Good
00:55 - this is a non object-oriented programming
01:00 - cut! OK, this is a non object-oriented program
01:05 - We are going to turn it into an object-oriented program. How are we going to do that?
01:10 - Ok so first thing first. We're going to sort of look at this backwards before we can make an object in our code
01:17 - We've got to define a class, but let's actually look again at the syntax for using objects in our code
01:24 - Well, we know
01:28 - The general framework they're setup() and there is draw().
01:36 - Set up and draw
01:38 - We need to first declare a variable bubble b. This is pretty similar to something we've done before
01:47 - int
01:49 - x
01:50 - This is the type
01:53 - This is the name we have done something super duper exciting here
01:59 - What we've done is we've actually in our minds made an entire new data type
02:05 - We've really only looked at this idea of oh there's floats
02:09 - There's ints maybe if you've kind of gotten a little further into Processing. Beyond this video
02:14 - You might have even made something of type p image of type string
02:20 - These are objects note the capital letter. That's just the convention
02:25 - Lowercase here these data types are primitive data types. A primitive data type is a data type with just a single number of 0,
02:33 - 1, 2.3 something like that a
02:36 - Object Data type is more complex. It's a collection of Data and
02:41 - Functions, I think that's what I talked about the previous video that was last week when I made that you know as you can tell
02:47 - By the different shirt that I'm wearing probably not that I don't afford the same shirt every day, but anyway um
02:54 - ok so here we are
02:56 - Bubble b, we have made a data type called bubble. Boy we are already several minutes into this video. Let's keep going ok now
03:04 - When it comes time to go through
03:07 - Into draw we want to act on that bubble
03:12 - What did we call that? Ascend, we want it to ascend to the top of the window we want to display, we what to ascend.
03:19 - this is what is informally known as as dot syntax?
03:25 - We are doing something different. we are calling a function
03:29 - But we are not calling a function
03:32 - Just willy-nilly we are not just saying hey, you display. Hey, I said a top. We're saying no, no
03:37 - No, this object display this object b dot display. We're calling the function on that
03:43 - Object so anytime the object is b. That's the variable name the type. It's a type bubble
03:49 - We're going to see how we define that type in a class in a moment
03:54 - We are now saying we are acting on that. We are accessing that object through the dot. We're saying B
04:00 - Dot that thought is like go inside and display the go inside and ascend.
04:05 - We're saying send that B-but bubble B. Display that Bubble B
04:09 - This is new here's the thing though if we were to run this code right now. It would say: "Meh"
04:13 - Remember, it's like I don't know what that bubble is. It's null, no pointer exception
04:17 - You really don't want to see null pointer exception
04:19 - it is very upsetting so you could avoid them if you're at int x
04:24 - Semicolon we declare this variable that was step one remember with variables back in our variable videos
04:29 - What did we forget to do we forgot to initialize
04:33 - Well with a with a integer we might just say x equals 10 with an object we use something a little bit funny
04:40 - the syntax looks like this
04:41 - equals new
04:43 - bubble
04:46 - New so this is something new that we haven't seen before put something new if it's the word new
04:51 - okay, so
04:53 - This is saying... what it really is... as if you almost literally translated
04:58 - b is a new instance of a bubble object. b equals new bubble. that's what we're saying. new means make me a new object
05:04 - This is actually executing something called the constructor, and we're going to see it in a little while drawing the greens for you
05:12 - That we're going to see in just a little bit
05:14 - We the constructor is the moment where the object is born it's the birth of the bubble object you just constructed
05:20 - They should call that the birther. No that doesn't make sense the constructor.
05:25 - Yeah, okay, so what this is this is where...
05:29 - you know we're actually gonna go to the next video in a moment, but
05:32 - This is where we are what we've got. Now is we know we have this prop... this program here that conceptually
05:41 - Has this bubble floating up it has some variables and has some functions for doing that but it's not written in an object-oriented way
05:47 - This is the guts of the bubble the guts of the bubble is all here in the main program
05:52 - We want to move the guts to a class
05:55 - So that in the main program. We can actually discuss the bubble itself the bubble object okay, so we're going to stop this video
06:03 - We're going to go to the next one in the next one. We're going to write the class
06:08 - You know interestingly enough you know, I'm trying to come up with an exercise at the end of these videos
06:12 - There's not really one for here, but you could save yourself if this is
06:18 - What, let's say you know, but hopefully maybe you know something, maybe you're just watching these videos for fun, I have no idea.
06:24 - I can't imagine you're watching for fun. They're not that fun, but
06:28 - imagine that you
06:29 - Never knew anything about object oriented programming ever at all in your whole life and this is all you just learned which might be actually
06:35 - the case you're in. Type this code into Processing copy, paste it from the thing we have below in our magical web video internet Web
06:43 - Automatic thing we don't have yet and then try to decide
06:47 - What would you how would you write a programming language so that how would you define the class for making a bubble?
06:52 - How would you do that?
06:54 - where would you put the functions where would you put the variables how would you do that sort of think that through because in the
06:58 - Next video, we're going to see how it's done in Processing. Maybe you've just invented an entirely new programming language, and that's an exciting thing
07:05 - Okay, and now this is the end of this video
07:09 - it's the end
