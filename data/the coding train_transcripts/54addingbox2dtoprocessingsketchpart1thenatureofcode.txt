00:01 - hi so here's our goal we want to get to
00:05 - the point where we have written example
00:07 - what what corresponds to example five
00:09 - point two if you're falling on the book
00:10 - so if I run this example we see this is
00:13 - HelloWorld box2d we've got boxes coming
00:16 - out of a point they're falling they're
00:18 - responding to physics they're colliding
00:19 - they're bouncing off of these platforms
00:21 - all of the physics in this example are
00:23 - being controlled by box2d the if you
00:25 - look through the code you'll see all
00:27 - we're doing is asking where's the
00:28 - location what are the angles and drawing
00:30 - everything on the screen so how are we
00:32 - going to get there so here is our
00:33 - exercise we're going to back up and I'm
00:35 - going to show you look at example five
00:37 - point one what is example five point one
00:39 - it is a very simple processing sketch we
00:42 - have an empty ArrayList of box objects
00:44 - every frame we add a new box object and
00:46 - so here we can see I'm adding these box
00:49 - objects what we are exercised here is to
00:51 - give these box objects physics so let's
00:54 - look at the code for these box objects
00:56 - these box objects have already typed
01:00 - this in there ah erase that these box
01:02 - objects have an X and a Y and a width
01:04 - and a height they're static
01:05 - joana display method that's it if you
01:08 - kind of rewind yourself all the way back
01:10 - to the beginning of this video series
01:11 - this is what we were doing we said aha
01:13 - aha we want to add location velocity
01:16 - acceleration and apply force function
01:18 - and update method where velocity goes to
01:20 - the location acceleration goes in
01:21 - velocity we started to write all the
01:23 - code for the physics now we're going to
01:25 - take a different approach instead of
01:27 - writing all the code for the physics
01:29 - inside of this class we're going to
01:31 - store a reference to a physics object
01:34 - that comes from box 2d what is that
01:36 - physics object is that I had typed it in
01:38 - here before it's a body body so instead
01:42 - of location velocity acceleration we get
01:45 - a body the body has all that in it the
01:47 - body updates itself it figures out if
01:49 - it's colliding with things we don't have
01:50 - to implement any of that
01:52 - we just want a reference to that body
01:54 - that body is going to have to be given
01:56 - an initial position and X Y and a size
01:58 - but then it's going to be updated
02:00 - through box2d so this is kind of a new
02:03 - way of thinking it's like an object
02:04 - within an object like our object is a
02:06 - box but our box object really what it is
02:08 - it's a reference to a box2d body so the
02:11 - different approaches here and when we
02:12 - get to toxic lib
02:13 - actually gonna see a different approach
02:14 - to this kind of thing but this is the
02:18 - approach we're taking right now
02:19 - so the question becomes first and
02:22 - foremost how do we make this body object
02:25 - and unfortunately the answer to the
02:28 - question is it's somewhat of a nightmare
02:29 - and there's a lot of steps involved and
02:32 - the code is a lot of syntax a lot of
02:34 - methods and things to remember and I
02:35 - don't know that there's any way that you
02:37 - would be able to complete this exercise
02:39 - you know you could look try to look up
02:41 - the reference of the documentation so
02:42 - what I'm gonna do is talk through the
02:44 - steps to initializing this box2d body
02:47 - it's four or five steps we're going to
02:49 - talk through those without code and then
02:51 - I'm gonna look at the code
02:52 - implementation of that and point out
02:54 - where you will sort of where the
02:56 - reference is to kind of look up where
02:58 - all these functions are and what are all
02:59 - the parameters but there's no way to
03:00 - kind of I think easily go through all of
03:02 - it I said in the previous video and I
03:04 - didn't think it was very good so anyway
03:06 - here we are so let's so this is our job
03:08 - right now we need to initialize this
03:10 - body so I'm going to talk you through
03:12 - the steps of how to initialize a box2d
03:14 - body okay so step one create a body
03:19 - definition create a and I'm gonna call
03:25 - it body death so this is a body
03:28 - definition but the actual object we're
03:31 - going to create from box D from J box
03:33 - it's called body def now this is kind of
03:35 - a strange thing didn't we say we wanted
03:37 - to create a body this is just the way
03:39 - box 2d and lots of things work in order
03:41 - to create a body we need to create a
03:42 - body definition and from that body
03:44 - definition we'll make a body object so
03:46 - it's just kind of the organizational
03:48 - principle that we're working under in
03:49 - theory you could make multiple bodies
03:51 - from one body definition but we're not
03:53 - worrying about that right now okay so
03:55 - create a body definition now the body
03:57 - definition is where you set two really
04:00 - key parameters to the body one is simply
04:03 - and there's a bunch of things its
04:05 - initial position so where is it going to
04:08 - start in the world it needs an initial
04:10 - position the other thing we're going to
04:13 - give it is a type type is very important
04:18 - we're going to see three options
04:20 - I guess I'll write these down for you
04:22 - dynamic
04:25 - static they spelled it wrong and
04:28 - kinematic what are these three types
04:34 - well if the start everything is
04:35 - basically going to be dynamic a dynamic
04:37 - body is one that moves in response to
04:39 - physics that's what we want we want a
04:40 - body that moves in response to physics
04:42 - if you remember though in that example
04:44 - 5.2 there are those platforms that the
04:46 - boxes are landing on those are static
04:48 - bodies a static body is kind of an
04:50 - artificial thing it's a fixed body that
04:52 - can never be moved which is useful in
04:54 - lots of workouts you might want to make
04:56 - kinematic is kind of a funny thing and
04:58 - we'll get to it hopefully it actually
05:00 - happened on my list but we should get to
05:01 - it in a later video there are often
05:03 - times where you want any user controlled
05:06 - object in the physics world right we
05:08 - know we want static objects ones to just
05:09 - move and respond to physics but you
05:11 - might have one that's controlled by the
05:12 - mouse or controlled by your you know
05:14 - your hand in a computer vision tracking
05:16 - system so that is a kinematic body so
05:18 - when we create that body definition we
05:20 - need to set the position and the type
05:22 - and we'll see that in when we look at
05:24 - the code implementation number two we
05:27 - now need to create the body so this is
05:31 - simple this is just going to be one line
05:33 - of code once we've defined the body in
05:35 - all of its parameters and there's other
05:36 - parameters as well you can define like
05:39 - you can give it an initial velocity and
05:40 - certain things but we're just looking at
05:42 - these two right now then we can create
05:45 - that body object so what's the funny
05:48 - thing about a box2d body so if this is
05:51 - our box2d world we could think of the
05:54 - box2d bodies like a little tiny dot it's
05:57 - emptiness it had it's nothing it's just
06:00 - this sort of point
06:01 - singular point that moves throughout the
06:03 - space the magic of box2d the
06:06 - wonderfulness of out Bach CD is that
06:08 - there that that bodies have geometry but
06:11 - bodies actual bodies don't have geometry
06:13 - but we can attach geometry to a body we
06:16 - can give it a shape so the next thing we
06:19 - need to do is create a shape the shape
06:26 - is what it's going to define what that
06:27 - body looks like how it responds to
06:30 - collisions what is the form that it's
06:32 - actually taking though the body is just
06:34 - the sort of empty soul and the shape is
06:36 - the form that is at
06:38 - that's all if that makes any sense so um
06:41 - when we create the shape we can create a
06:42 - number of different kinds of shapes just
06:45 - some examples are polygon shape that's
06:48 - what we're gonna start with a polygon
06:50 - shape can be and any arbitrary polygon
06:52 - with any arbitrary set of vertices or it
06:54 - can be something like a box with a width
06:57 - and a height another kind of shape that
07:03 - we can create as a circle shape sorry
07:05 - so if we have circular objects you can
07:08 - imagine what that is we're gonna use
07:09 - we're gonna create a circle shape there
07:11 - are other things too one that just jumps
07:13 - in my mind right now is change shape and
07:15 - we'll look at some examples of a change
07:17 - shape a change shape is something you
07:18 - might use for a surface like a terrain
07:21 - and in a two-dimensional world so there
07:24 - are different kinds of shapes and once
07:26 - we create that and define that shape
07:28 - what needs to happen is that shape needs
07:30 - to be attached to the body so the body
07:32 - experiences the physics location
07:35 - velocity acceleration it gets forces
07:37 - applied to it the shape is the geometry
07:39 - attached to that body the way we attach
07:41 - a shape to a body and if this is super
07:43 - exciting right is a fixture so we need
07:48 - to create a fixture a fixture you can
07:52 - think of as the glue that binds the
07:55 - shape to the body the interesting thing
07:57 - about the fixture is the fixture is the
07:59 - place where we get to set some other
08:00 - physics parameters notably density
08:06 - friction and restitution density
08:13 - friction and restitution so density you
08:16 - can imagine if is more dense it's going
08:19 - to be more it's gonna have a higher mass
08:21 - based on how big it is so density can
08:23 - affect the behavior of something by
08:25 - making it have a kind of weightier feel
08:27 - to it in the physics world friction is
08:29 - just how much friction does that body
08:31 - experience when it comes into contact
08:32 - with another sorry does that shape
08:34 - experience when it comes into contact
08:35 - with another shape and restitution you
08:38 - can think of as elasticity or bounciness
08:40 - so if you if you're dropping if I had a
08:43 - nice little you know basketball or
08:46 - something and I were to drop it how much
08:47 - would it bounce off the floor versus how
08:49 - much would sort of just land with a thud
08:51 - not bounce back up so and I'm dropping
08:54 - things up and caught it okay so these
08:55 - are all the parameters we get to define
08:58 - them create the fixture and the very
09:00 - last step which if I'm still on the
09:02 - board here is kind of put it all
09:04 - together and I'll just write that out
09:05 - here put it all together putting it all
09:09 - together means use the fixture to attach
09:12 - the shape to the body so you can you
09:14 - recall right we started with this
09:15 - question of I want my box object to
09:18 - instead of me having to add location
09:20 - velocity acceleration working on the
09:21 - physics I'm going to add a body to it
09:23 - I'm just going to put a body object to
09:25 - it and I need to you know probably in
09:27 - the constructor initialize the body so
09:29 - you would think that would just be body
09:31 - equals new body XY boom I'm done and
09:33 - it's just not that simple box2d requires
09:36 - a lot of steps to set up all the initial
09:38 - parameters about the body where is it
09:40 - what kind is it what's a shape how is
09:42 - that shape attached what are the physics
09:43 - parameters and these are those steps so
09:46 - these are those steps so in the next
09:49 - video what I want to do is actually look
09:51 - at how do we take each one of these
09:53 - steps and apply it in code so there
09:56 - isn't really a good exercise to go from
09:58 - this one to the next one
10:00 - but one of the things I would say that
10:01 - you might take the time to do is go back
10:04 - and review now go look at that box2d
10:06 - manual so go back and look at the link
10:08 - to the box of the manual read the little
10:10 - section about the body read the section
10:11 - about shapes read the section about
10:12 - fixtures and see if that if any of this
10:14 - kind of like is starting to gel into
10:15 - your head and in the next video we're
10:17 - going to look at each one of these steps
10:19 - in code and and see the example really
10:21 - happen okay
