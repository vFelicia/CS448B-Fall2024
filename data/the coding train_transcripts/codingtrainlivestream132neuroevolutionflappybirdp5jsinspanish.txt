00:01 - wah-wah hello and welcome to another
00:05 - Friday edition of the coding train with
00:09 - me and some new cloaking device for this
00:12 - laptop over here I this is why I'm late
00:14 - actually I was up here leisurely just
00:17 - like getting some fresh green paper with
00:19 - some tape and putting the making nice
00:21 - little things of tape and putting it on
00:23 - the green paper and then putting it over
00:25 - here you're wondering what I'm talking
00:26 - about you can't see maybe I could go
00:29 - here no that doesn't really help so
00:32 - anyway but I'm I'm then I realized oh
00:33 - it's 1:30 I have to start live streaming
00:38 - and yes so I so people that shat are
00:42 - pointing out that something is different
00:43 - let's see can you figure out what is
00:47 - different and no I'm not referring to my
00:51 - haircut although I did get a haircut
00:53 - that was this is less than 24 hours old
00:57 - no wilderness Dan unfortunately today it
00:59 - was very strong wilderness stand by
01:01 - yesterday afternoon and I decided to get
01:03 - the haircut because there's also
01:05 - something else different I'm looking in
01:09 - the chat
01:10 - this snow is gone hi it is a balmy 60
01:16 - some degrees Fahrenheit here in New York
01:18 - City today it is a warm almost one might
01:20 - say spring-like day and I decided that
01:23 - today is the day that I will remove the
01:27 - coating trained snowy background all
01:31 - right so here I am as I often M you
01:34 - let's say you're watching for the first
01:36 - time maybe you are maybe you aren't
01:38 - sorry unlikely that you are but let's
01:39 - say you are watching for the first time
01:41 - my name is Daniel Schiffman and I appear
01:46 - every Friday except for some Fridays
01:48 - including unfortunately next Friday next
01:51 - Friday will not be here next Friday I'll
01:52 - try to have a makeup date for that but
01:55 - every Friday to do some coding tutorials
01:58 - some fun time coding time things
02:01 - generally feel weird about the whole
02:02 - thing I'm actually just in a closet on
02:05 - the ninth floor of the 720 school of the
02:08 - arts in New York City
02:10 - there's no windows in here by myself
02:12 - I've got some
02:13 - Sunmi and I'm staring at a camera lens
02:14 - but I have this sense that there are
02:16 - people out there watching and that
02:17 - they're interested for some reason and
02:21 - what I have I'm not really what I have
02:23 - to say but perhaps what I am going to do
02:24 - so let me take a look here and I'm just
02:29 - checking the chat grey wizard got no
02:34 - snow in the chat I don't know if that
02:37 - message came before I said it or not
02:38 - because the timing is hard for me to
02:40 - tell but I'm going to assume that gray
02:42 - was or did figure it out so I'm excited
02:45 - I know I hear a little bit subdued today
02:48 - I'm not sure why I didn't plan for that
02:50 - just or what's coming off of me here but
02:53 - I am going to do something that I've
02:55 - been hoping to do for a long time I'm
03:00 - going to tackle tonight do I have it
03:02 - open neuro evolution so let me show this
03:05 - to you this here is a version of the
03:09 - game flappy bird otherwise known as
03:12 - flappy train this is a version that came
03:17 - from that started with what is in this
03:22 - github repository the coding train
03:25 - flappy bird clone this is a fork of that
03:28 - repository made by versatility
03:34 - train contributor did I get the did I
03:37 - pronounce that I don't actually don't
03:38 - know that that must mean something
03:40 - we're on generation 7 here I was
03:43 - wondering why I'm only on generation 7
03:44 - when I left that was letting was run in
03:46 - the background because I didn't have it
03:47 - open so I have a bunch of examples of
03:52 - something called neuro evolution meaning
03:54 - a genetic algorithm to evolve a neural
03:57 - network for some tasks such as an
03:59 - optimal play strategy for the game
04:01 - flappy bird and so I'm going to as
04:03 - coding challenge number 100 I am going
04:12 - to make my own version look at that look
04:14 - at that beautiful almost made it make my
04:17 - own version of this let's see if though
04:20 - before I do that I can get some
04:23 - thumbnails for a match yet
04:28 - we need some we need some pipe designs
04:29 - that come in here all right all right so
04:36 - that I just need to have a good
04:37 - thumbnail for the video that's gonna
04:39 - come out of me during the livestream
04:42 - closing for a thumbnail image later
04:44 - that's exactly what you were watching so
04:47 - uh now so what I'm going to do today is
04:50 - I'm going to make a version that does
04:52 - precisely this that evolves an optimal
04:55 - play strategy for the game flappy bird i
04:58 - however even though i did say that the
05:02 - reason I was making this particular
05:03 - github repository was so that I could
05:06 - have a more fun interesting coding train
05:09 - theme design for the game
05:11 - this became enough of a project that the
05:14 - complexity of the code is such that I
05:16 - would rather go back to my original
05:20 - simplified it's just an ellipse and
05:23 - white squares white rectangles as the
05:25 - pipes designed for flappy bird in order
05:28 - to just demonstrate the core aspect so
05:32 - in the tutorial I'm going to use just
05:34 - I'm gonna let's so let me find that
05:37 - right now
05:37 - so I'm gonna go to by way did you know
05:39 - that the coding train has a website it
05:42 - is the coding train com Oh weirdly I
05:45 - thought it's supposed to say like live
05:48 - like when I'm live here but I don't know
05:52 - why it doesn't do that maybe it doesn't
05:53 - do that who knows you act this website
05:57 - you can find things like a button to
06:00 - subscribe to the coding train channel if
06:02 - you have not subscribed maybe you might
06:04 - like to subscribe I'm supposed to ask
06:07 - you that because that's the number that
06:09 - is like the thing that means something
06:11 - but should it mean something I'm not so
06:13 - sure who cares
06:14 - alright then you can also if you so
06:17 - choose become a patron through the
06:18 - service patreon and you will get an
06:20 - invitation to a slack channel and in the
06:23 - slack Channel right now Don Wilson asks
06:25 - is the level generation the same every
06:28 - loop or does it change each time there's
06:31 - no my simple version of the flappy bird
06:33 - game has no level level jet no no
06:37 - content
06:38 - of levels it's one game that just
06:39 - happens now
06:41 - let's say I wanted to find my original
06:43 - code for that flappy bird game I'm gonna
06:46 - go here to coding challenges then I'm
06:49 - going to search on this page I'm gonna
06:52 - go to flappy bird and hero clappy bird a
06:55 - flappy bird so here it is coding
06:57 - challenge it was number 31 I wore let me
06:59 - see Jai still have that green headband
07:02 - hold on a second
07:04 - indulge me here all I do in that coding
07:08 - challenge I thought it would be fun to
07:11 - have like a rainbow headband for like
07:13 - I'm a 1980s aerobics instructor but the
07:17 - problem with this headband as you'll
07:19 - soon see is it has it might just look
07:22 - like it has a like if I stand over here
07:24 - it looks like it just has like a white
07:27 - stripe but it's green and you will
07:29 - notice that as soon as I go over here
07:31 - and you will see it changes color or I
07:32 - walk around you can start to see the
07:33 - text or it so I don't think I can wear
07:35 - this because too many people make the
07:37 - comment that your head is separated from
07:39 - your body but there we are
07:43 - okay so now if I'm on the coding train
07:45 - website I could next click I could watch
07:49 - that video or I could go to this to the
07:51 - challenge and now I am on a web page
07:54 - that has the name of the challenge it
07:57 - has a description here in this coding
07:59 - challenge I attempt to program in
08:00 - JavaScript using the p5.js framework
08:02 - probably should say people I've just
08:03 - library right here a clone of the game
08:06 - flappy bird and then I could click here
08:08 - get the code and it's downloaded for me
08:13 - I could also click here on live example
08:16 - and I could see here is the game running
08:19 - in the browser what is the deal what's
08:23 - the deal with slow frame rates in the
08:26 - browser
08:28 - have you ever but I'm poor Seinfeld
08:32 - depression um why is why is this like
08:35 - what's going on on this computer it's
08:39 - just 30 frames per second I just feel
08:42 - like when I was looking at this on my
08:45 - other computer downstairs earlier today
08:47 - it was very very fast I got to make some
08:50 - improvements
08:51 - this game so okay what am I here for I
08:55 - am going to grab this code so bear with
09:00 - me for a second here I am going to put
09:03 - it on the desktop and I'm going to
09:05 - rename it to neuro evolution flappy
09:13 - train and I am going to open this up in
09:20 - the atom
09:21 - oh maybe I'll use noop cat oh excuse me
09:30 - no op cat was here last week
09:33 - I've not released the edited version of
09:34 - her tutorial but she installed I term Oh
09:39 - tip of the day message yeah ooh the
09:44 - window shows I term to tip of the day it
09:47 - will appear every 24 hours to let you
09:49 - know about new features and hidden
09:50 - secrets more options to view more tips I
09:53 - would love to just stay here and look at
09:55 - all these tips I'm on a time schedule or
09:58 - p.m. this challenge will be over it's
10:02 - July the live stream will not be over
10:07 - but the challenge will be over alright I
10:10 - I'm not ready for a new workflow today I
10:12 - was gonna use Visual Studio code and I
10:15 - term I'm not ready so close to being
10:17 - ready but I'm just not ready somebody
10:20 - goes desktop I'm going to go into this
10:24 - sketch and I'm gonna run my fancy little
10:27 - simple HTTP server I'm gonna minimize
10:30 - the terminal then I am going to open the
10:33 - atom editor alright these are the things
10:36 - that anyone else would do before they
10:40 - start live streaming but I cannot bring
10:42 - myself to do that I'm going to close
10:44 - this I'm gonna go here I'm going to drag
10:47 - this down to the atom editor I am going
10:49 - to narrate everything I'm doing on the
10:51 - computer so that you can hear what I'm
10:52 - saying and then I'm going to take a look
10:56 - at the code
10:56 - I'm gonna indulge whatever it's asking
11:01 - to do here all right
11:04 - so hello are you still watching this
11:08 - live stream I was quickly just getting
11:10 - my code from coding challenge 31 because
11:12 - that is the base code I'm going to start
11:15 - with I'm getting a notification I would
11:23 - have missed that meeting today okay I'm
11:26 - gonna miss everything is fine
11:28 - Calendar alert away all right so now
11:31 - what I want to do a few things I want to
11:33 - do I want to go into the web browser
11:36 - here is the game I know the camera has
11:40 - shut off I really did think I really was
11:44 - starting this afternoon so I thought I'd
11:46 - have a little more time this morning to
11:47 - like prepare some stuff and maybe try
11:49 - installing magics firmware it didn't get
11:52 - to it surprise surprise
11:54 - okay so I need to do some stuff to the
11:56 - game first so a couple things I want to
12:00 - do number one is I would like to be
12:02 - using the most recent p5.js and I'm just
12:05 - going to reference it from the CDN so I
12:10 - want p5 Minjae s which I'm going to put
12:15 - here and then I want I might want to use
12:20 - the Dom library so why don't I get this
12:23 - I'm use the minified versions okay
12:34 - notifications will come again correct
12:38 - Simon and the chat says I thought you've
12:40 - done this as chapter 11 in nature of
12:42 - code that is correct this coding
12:44 - challenge will be part of chapter 11 of
12:46 - the nature of code book the new chapter
12:48 - 11 to be written all right
12:51 - let's make sure this still works
12:57 - and now and now
13:04 - something nothing's gonna happen it's
13:07 - totally good that drum roll now okay
13:09 - let's let move a little quicker here I
13:10 - lost my what I was seeing about let me
13:13 - replace bar with let now oh I'm going to
13:19 - show you sighs a fun little tip here is
13:23 - a nice little regular expression for
13:24 - converting something from yes five is
13:28 - this what's going on here oh it's the
13:30 - table is just poking through they're
13:33 - converting yes five function constructor
13:37 - function syntax the es6 classes and I'm
13:40 - going to say find and I'm going to look
13:42 - for I'm going to turn on regular
13:44 - expressions I'm gonna say this backslash
13:47 - dot parenthesis dot star question mark n
13:52 - parenthesis space equals space equals
13:57 - space function see this look I want a
14:01 - regular expression that can find every
14:04 - single reference to this dot of function
14:08 - name equals function parenthesis and I
14:10 - probably should make the amount of
14:12 - spaces here optional oh no come back
14:16 - it went away what I have to retype that
14:21 - in well I will zoom into it at least now
14:24 - so you'll see so I'm making a regular
14:25 - expression here I am looking for this
14:30 - the reason why I put back slash dot is
14:32 - because I want to escape the period the
14:35 - period as a meta character in a regular
14:37 - special means any character then I want
14:39 - to capture whatever is in here I don't
14:43 - want it to be greedy like I want to stop
14:45 - as soon as I match any number of spaces
14:48 - followed by an equal sign followed by
14:51 - zero more spaces followed by the word
14:53 - function so now now that I have done
14:56 - that I want to replace this with just
14:59 - what I captured there so I want to turn
15:02 - this constructor function into an es6
15:04 - class and so now I'm going to say
15:07 - replace all and I have done that there
15:10 - I'm gonna do it on the pipe I'm gonna
15:12 - say replace all I've also done it there
15:14 - now I'm going to go to that and I'm
15:16 - gonna just start doing this manually now
15:18 - could make a rave expression for the
15:20 - rest of it but it's only two classes I'm
15:22 - gonna change this to be a constructor
15:24 - function and I'm gonna go to the pipe
15:26 - and I'm gonna change this to be oh
15:29 - whoops I have to change this to class
15:32 - that's what I meant to say and then on
15:33 - the pipe I'm gonna change this to class
15:35 - and then I'm gonna write a constructor
15:37 - function and I'm going to close it here
15:40 - and there we go so now I have hopefully
15:46 - still a working game all right let me
15:49 - fix up this game to make it a little bit
15:50 - better number one let's change the
15:54 - resolution to like 640 by 480 oh okay
16:03 - why is it so weirdly what is going on
16:07 - why is it running like it's the slowest
16:10 - thing in the world what is go am I crazy
16:16 - I'm looking for like anybody fall along
16:20 - running this code and it's running like
16:21 - this sluggishly is it because I'm
16:23 - sending the output of the I'm so
16:26 - confused all right let me let me not
16:28 - worry about it
16:29 - I'm gonna make the pipes a little bit
16:31 - wider they look very thin that looks
16:35 - better I am also going to a ho ho I
16:40 - think this is let me go to let me get
16:44 - this improvement from that's already in
16:49 - so I think this is better to actually
16:52 - have a the same spacing between each
16:55 - pipe and then a random spot where that
17:00 - occurs so let me do this let me grab
17:02 - this and let's see if this works no okay
17:23 - why didn't that work let's look
17:25 - let's take some more improvements from
17:27 - here draw a seat this is why I didn't
17:30 - want to get into this draw half draw
17:34 - half rect mode this dot x0 this w this
17:46 - top this dot x height minus this dot
17:50 - bottom this w this dot bottom that makes
17:53 - sense does this make sense the top is a
17:58 - random place between a random place
18:09 - between height divided by six and
18:11 - three-quarters of the height it sort of
18:16 - makes sense and is there some like let
18:23 - me just make sure a rect mode corner so
18:31 - what have I done here let's say pipe
18:35 - pipes index zero spacing is 125 the top
18:47 - is 267 and the bottom is 392 and the X
18:51 - is 210 this makes sense
18:54 - top spacing hmm oh this is going well so
18:59 - far isn't it let's comment out that top
19:08 - is 124 that looks like about 124 the
19:12 - second one top is 248 that looks like it
19:15 - so that looks like that's right so the
19:20 - bottom is this dot top plus oh that's
19:23 - not the side that's ahahaha the bottom
19:27 - is the location of the bottom oh this is
19:31 - easy but I probably should conform to
19:35 - whatever I'm doing here which is
19:38 - the way that I'm height - so the bottom
19:42 - should actually be height - this dot top
19:48 - post this dot spacing right the way that
19:50 - I have programmed this is that I want
19:53 - the bottom to be the Y location of the
19:55 - bottom but the way the way that I
20:03 - actually have programmed this is for the
20:05 - bottom to be the size of the bottom
20:08 - right because the way that I'm drawing
20:14 - it is from the height - that much so
20:18 - it's not the location it's the size of
20:20 - it which should be fine there we go so
20:22 - there's always going to be why it's slow
20:27 - it's always going to be 125 and boy
20:31 - they're really quite using the original
20:34 - code I get 60 frames per second Yeah
20:39 - right what's going on on this computer
20:44 - something's going on with my Chrome I
20:49 - noticed that this computer was having
20:51 - this issue well that's the same speed
21:01 - does that feel faster to you how do I
21:05 - see the how do I find the console web
21:09 - developer web console framerate
21:18 - weird is it actually all right so hold
21:32 - on
21:43 - Wow gained like 20 frames per second um
21:47 - too many pages open I don't think that's
21:50 - the probably do have this open that
21:51 - certainly can't be helping but look at
21:56 - that it's like so sluggish alright I got
21:59 - to figure this out everybody I'm gonna
22:05 - do something kind of terrible let me I
22:13 - will remove this later if you all could
22:17 - do me a favor and I'm just uploading
22:21 - these files run this please there is now
22:27 - in the flappy bird clone github repo
22:32 - this will just take a minute here some
22:44 - try this sketch and let me know if
22:46 - you're getting the same speeds as I am
22:49 - because I don't know why it is running
22:52 - so sluggishly which is fine like I can
22:56 - live with that like I could always
23:09 - okay like for example I can make the
23:16 - pipes faster and I can have the pipes
23:21 - come out less often like so but it's
23:28 - just like barely running and yeah right
23:44 - 60 like something's going on on this
23:47 - computer and yeah okay I would restart
24:06 - the computer I don't want to do that
24:10 - [Music]
24:23 - yeah people are getting 60
24:24 - frames-per-second right I guess I'll try
24:30 - restarting Chrome I have an idea I'm
24:34 - gonna do is I'm gonna take extreme
24:36 - measures I'm going to clear
24:55 - is uh but once the page has been served
25:08 - huh
25:11 - like all my momentum has been killed
25:16 - alright fine let me look at this
25:40 - let's try
25:52 - let's look at Firefox
26:18 - [Music]
26:29 - frame well guess I don't really care
26:37 - that much 30 frames per second
26:45 - yeah yeah I'm still only getting 30
26:49 - frames per second on Firefox
26:51 - maybe I'll restart this guy I'm just
26:53 - gonna just gonna restart the computer I
26:57 - don't have to restart the stream and
26:59 - then I'm gonna give up because I don't
27:01 - want to spend all my time I want to get
27:03 - to decoding he lost all of my energy the
27:07 - restart the eye I did just fresh restart
27:10 - the computer I'm in the void try to
27:25 - enable hardware acceleration what's that
27:30 - [Music]
27:40 - [Music]
27:41 - I could try disabling the friendly
27:53 - errors but like that shouldn't be
27:55 - enabled so let's check some stuff and
28:00 - then I just need it's probably a new
28:03 - computer let me do Chrome is up to date
28:22 - [Music]
28:30 - [Music]
28:39 - [Music]
28:42 - Ashley sluggish disabled friendly errors
29:11 - like I spell that right disabled
29:14 - friendly air oh it goes true vehicle's
29:19 - true probably what else weird
29:26 - okay enabling a hardware acceleration
29:28 - how do I do that
29:30 - preferences yeah it's enabled what if I
29:40 - disable it oh I feel like that got
29:47 - better
29:49 - [Music]
29:56 - [Music]
29:59 - well hi Yanis or jonas all right that's
30:43 - it I'm out of here train is leaving the
30:47 - station
30:48 - oh this doesn't make any sense I think
30:52 - it's just this I think it's just time
30:54 - for a new laptop
30:56 - I think this laptop just has a lot of
30:58 - trouble really it's on its last legs
31:02 - probably should do something to help it
31:05 - out oh my God look at that I'm going to
31:20 - all right I'm gonna live with this speed
31:22 - is perfectly fine it's 30 I'm not really
31:25 - leaving it's 30 frames per second I
31:28 - turned off the hardware acceleration so
31:31 - the reason why I don't think this
31:32 - matters is I'm pretty sure that's why I
31:34 - was using the minified version of p5 the
31:36 - friendly errors are disabled by default
31:37 - I thought with the minified version why
31:41 - are the pipes never arriving this this
31:53 - should be easy enough for an agent an AI
31:57 - agent to beat it's pretty easy for me to
32:01 - play I'm just testing out the game here
32:08 - all right great
32:09 - let's make the pipes a little bit closer
32:11 - just don't want it to be too easy I
32:15 - think this is fine let's make the pipes
32:18 - speed a little bit faster and that's
32:29 - good okay
32:38 - all right okay everybody now we're good
32:48 - got this game I don't actually need this
32:50 - highlighting thing so I'm going to take
32:52 - that out that is not relevant for this
32:57 - particular thing that I'm going to do
33:03 - the other piece however that I do need
33:06 - is I need the files from the toy neural
33:12 - network library I need to have matrix a
33:23 - chess and neural network is and I just
33:29 - need to put those in here I'm gonna put
33:32 - these in line I'm not actually using
33:34 - this anymore and right I'm referring to
33:40 - zero points I have actually a weird sort
33:45 - of nonsensical theory that I'm gonna try
33:47 - in a second and then I just need to
33:51 - reference those files as well
33:59 - matrix yes okay all right now we're
34:07 - cooking now we are cooking okay so hold
34:13 - on everyone
34:13 - it's a couple or the one thing I just
34:15 - curious to try
34:26 - oh those are in sorry a folder called
34:30 - libraries I think it's fine I'm good I
34:41 - just thought maybe I'm gonna live
34:48 - happily with my 30 frames I feel like my
34:54 - browser must be like ebooks whoops I'm
34:57 - just not gonna worry about this before
35:00 - we're gonna do neuro evolution huh okay
35:04 - and this one over whoops there we go all
35:14 - right all right everyone I think it has
35:20 - something to do with the integrated
35:21 - graphics probably yeah all right all
35:25 - right let me check some of these smart
35:29 - ideas whoops
35:33 - nope it's locking me at like 30 for some
35:38 - reason even even if I don't do anything
35:40 - in draw this is an OL this is really old
35:46 - Mac I do need to get a new one yeah I
35:51 - sort of I also have this suspicion that
35:54 - hold on a sec give me one more thing to
35:58 - try I have now unplugged this is the
36:03 - plug that goes into the laptop so that
36:06 - you can see what's on my screen watch
36:10 - here we go can you read my mind you must
36:17 - build read my thoughts now or see them
36:18 - are they displayed behind me I hear
36:19 - computers can read minds now no it's not
36:23 - working
36:24 - all right hold on just give me a second
36:25 - here oh look at that
36:27 - I'm a dumb dummy doofus dumb dumb dummy
36:30 - I am getting like 60 frames per second
36:33 - wildly fast now really just the output
36:37 - causes the browser
36:39 - to not be able to render all this time
36:43 - it's been this cable yeah yeah the HDMI
36:50 - out is set to 30 frames per second it is
36:54 - true hold on hold on sometimes it's the
37:03 - little things in life I know I never get
37:05 - anything done but just be with me here
37:08 - in the moment as I try to achieve 60
37:11 - frames per second in the browser it's
37:13 - totally the screen refresh rate which by
37:16 - the way I think I have hacked no no no
37:18 - it went back so let me go to the display
37:22 - preferences and okay so now oh oh you
37:47 - can't see it anymore but so I just
37:52 - switched it to 1080i hold on everybody I
37:55 - think we're gonna be good in a second
37:58 - all this time no oh come on up here I
38:07 - won't show up at 60 frames per second
38:14 - well let me I'll put it at 60 frames per
38:17 - second well what if we do this no NTSC
38:21 - no 1080i60 no 1080i50 ah Oh weird weird
38:31 - this works but there's some weird stuff
38:37 - going on is this a problem yeah 30 is
38:42 - totally fine especially now that I know
38:44 - what the issue is but I just like it
38:49 - like this but does this look crazy weird
38:53 - I might need a better HDMI cable for 60
39:00 - I just like on my preview it looks all
39:03 - distorted and weird but I can't tell no
39:09 - I know I could just double the speed of
39:10 - everything just run 720p gross it looks
39:13 - awful okay we're going back we know what
39:15 - it is we know what it is
39:23 - Oh refresh rate is that oh look at this
39:26 - now I have this option hold on didn't
39:29 - give that to me before
39:30 - Oh cuz I was here hold on hold on I was
39:36 - at 50 oh it looks even worse okay okay
39:42 - we're doing we are doing you don't want
39:46 - I I is bad we want
39:52 - give me my scaled I want Oh 10 ATP and
39:59 - then 30 and 30 is the maximum alright
40:05 - going back to 1080p 30 whoa boy we're
40:10 - going back to 1080p 30 and there we go
40:22 - is there an option to disable the vsync
40:25 - in Chrome that is an interesting
40:26 - question whoa
40:28 - also what happened to my chrome there we
40:36 - go
40:41 - so now we're back we've got 30 and now
40:48 - uh Chrome settings let's see vsync no no
40:57 - no no 1600 by 900 well now we know a
41:06 - little bit more about interlacing we're
41:13 - fine everybody I'm done with this
41:15 - nonsense I am moving on this is the
41:19 - version of flappy bird the pipes look I
41:23 - think I want to just make the the birds
41:26 - motion a little bit like the gravity
41:30 - should be like a little bit stronger and
41:35 - ah oh it's got this like dampening which
41:37 - I think it's kind of unnecessary yes yes
41:45 - I know what's happening here and okay
42:01 - whoo that's way too much
42:17 - all right and a little bit hard to play
42:19 - here that's better
42:25 - just want to make sure the game I want
42:27 - to make sure like I can play the game
42:28 - and now I'm able to do that okay great
42:32 - all right chrome flags vsync is that
42:43 - really a thing
42:44 - there's no vsync in chrome okay all
42:47 - right everybody let's get to some coding
42:53 - huh let's get to some coding before I
43:03 - can get to coding I must get to erasing
43:07 - goodbye to no op cats drawings from last
43:10 - week
43:11 - you would think that these would get
43:14 - erased sometime in between and we finish
43:17 - now but no he's not meant to be I
43:22 - basically run out of this room as fast
43:25 - as I can because I've done and do not
43:28 - return to it until a week later and I
43:36 - have now exactly 1 hour 1 and 1/2 hours
43:43 - to complete this coding challenge
43:45 - because we are not gonna spend any more
43:48 - time worrying about the vsync we are
43:52 - just going to get to coding okay good
43:55 - here we go
44:08 - all right let's check this pen pretty
44:16 - good not so great
44:18 - let's try another one you can't see what
44:20 - I'm drawing is I'm drawing above better
44:24 - better no good trash
44:33 - those are these ones over here apply
44:34 - trash alright alright guy let this run
44:48 - for a little bit negative eight point
44:51 - five is the highest with point six
44:53 - gravity I think what I think I like
45:01 - where I've got got it right now I'm
45:03 - gonna let this one run from how how do
45:07 - you say versatil astute Tillis is that
45:09 - the correct pronunciation so I'm gonna
45:16 - let this one run because I want to start
45:18 - the opening of the coding challenge with
45:20 - nicely well I really should so we'll
45:27 - give this a few more minutes you should
45:29 - have been doing this I realize I can't
45:31 - let it run in the background because if
45:34 - I if I go here those it's still running
45:36 - yeah so long as it's like so I have the
45:41 - neural network libraries let me just
45:42 - remember couple things I want to find
45:44 - let me just remember does this have the
45:47 - copy yeah it has the copy function and
45:52 - also has this whoa mutate function which
45:59 - this is weird
46:02 - gonna change it yeah let me leave it at
46:08 - like
46:18 - change it to this okay we have that
46:21 - you know I was thinking actually the but
46:24 - everyone so let me make sure this is
46:26 - there then the other thing I want to go
46:27 - to is the pool selection closed
46:54 - this particular I want to make sure I
46:55 - have access to this algorithm and I
46:57 - think I actually have it in the
46:59 - traveling sales person coding challenge
47:04 - TSP I just want to have this yeah it's
47:14 - this function great great okay I just
47:18 - need this function okay all right okay
47:31 - okay Eric says I could use his real name
47:35 - this is from Eric coding trade
47:38 - contributor versatility on github who
47:42 - has been helping me manage some of the
47:45 - code in the neural network library he
47:47 - made version sort of testing how the
47:49 - nura evolution stuff would work and here
47:51 - we go looks like after a little bit of
47:53 - time it got it got almost all the way
47:54 - there okay well I'm here let's do that
48:02 - let's do a little moderation just modder
48:05 - just here moderating the YouTube chat
48:07 - for a minute okay and now we're ready
48:16 - let me
48:29 - all right okay it's time for coding
48:54 - challenge number 100 here we go uh in
48:59 - this coding challenge I am going to do
49:02 - something that I have been wanting to do
49:03 - on this channel for uh know about 100
49:06 - coding challenges I'm going to make a
49:08 - project that involves neuro evolution I
49:12 - am going to combine both neural networks
49:14 - and genetic algorithms into an agent
49:18 - into a simulation of a simple game and
49:20 - I'm going to train choo-choo train that
49:24 - agent to play that game effectively by
49:27 - making decisions with a neural network
49:28 - and evolving its neural network with a
49:31 - genetic algorithm way too much
49:33 - explanation so this is a demonstration
49:35 - that versatility on github coding train
49:39 - contributor Eric made this is using the
49:42 - flappy bird clone github repository that
49:45 - various folks have contributed to design
49:47 - ideas to and it's actually running neuro
49:49 - evolution right now and you can see
49:51 - these trains are kind of getting better
49:53 - and better at making their way through
49:55 - these little gaps so I'm going to
49:57 - program this myself now I'm gonna make a
49:59 - version of this in this coding challenge
50:02 - the difference however is I don't want
50:05 - to work in a sort of a simpler place so
50:07 - I am going to use the code from I think
50:10 - it was coding challenge number 31 which
50:12 - just is this simple version of flappy
50:14 - bird that I'm playing with the spacebar
50:16 - right now so I took out all the design
50:18 - stuff just to see if we can get the oh
50:20 - god I'm terrible at this the mechanic
50:22 - the mechanic of the game working now I
50:26 - need to move over to the white board to
50:28 - it for a second before I can write any
50:30 - code I want to talk about all of the
50:32 - pieces going on here alright so number
50:35 - one I need the I need to have the flappy
50:39 - bird game
50:41 - so you can look and find you if you
50:43 - wanted to recreate this coding challenge
50:45 - you can go and get coding challenge
50:48 - number 31 I've actually made a few minor
50:50 - tweaks to it but I will I guess after
50:52 - this is over of an update though so
50:54 - coding challenge 31 will mirror the code
50:56 - as I start with then I also need the toy
51:01 - neural network library which has two
51:08 - files associated with it matrix is and
51:13 - also neural I think it's just called n
51:18 - NJ s so this is the code for the neural
51:21 - network and a some code for some matrix
51:23 - multiplication math that's part of the
51:25 - neural network if you're interested in
51:27 - how this library was made boy do I have
51:29 - a lot of tutorials for you link to those
51:31 - somewhere in this video's description
51:33 - and this by the way incidentally just
51:35 - just has a file for the main sketch I
51:38 - believe it has a file called pipe touch
51:41 - a s and one called
51:42 - I know I'm probably writing off the side
51:44 - here but close enough pipe digest and
51:46 - one called
51:48 - bird s okay time out for a second I'm
51:54 - not able to see over there okay
52:04 - so this is all the code that I'm gonna
52:07 - start with now nowhere in here is there
52:11 - anything about a genetic algorithm so
52:14 - most of the code that I'm gonna write
52:15 - during this coding challenge I'm gonna
52:17 - put into a new file and I will call it G
52:20 - AJ s there are a couple features that
52:24 - are that are in this neural network
52:27 - class that are that I put there for the
52:31 - purposes of being able to apply a
52:33 - genetic algorithm and those are a
52:36 - function called copy which allows me to
52:38 - make a complete copy of a neural network
52:41 - in its like current state as well as
52:44 - mutate which is a function that allows
52:47 - me to make some minor random changes to
52:50 - the state of that neural network and
52:51 - when I say state I mean all of the
52:53 - weights so these are some things that
52:55 - I'm going to definitely need to make use
52:56 - of what I will not be doing is I won't
52:59 - be training the neural network in the
53:02 - sort of traditional way that you might
53:03 - have seen in some my other videos like
53:05 - the doodle classifier or the XOR
53:07 - challenge where I'm using this thing
53:09 - called back propagation supervised
53:11 - learning what I want to do in this video
53:14 - is something that's akin to this idea of
53:18 - reinforcement learning
53:21 - now reinforcement learning is a field of
53:26 - research that's been around for a very
53:27 - long time it predates deep learning
53:30 - neural networks all that sort of stuff
53:32 - and there's I love to UM do lots more
53:34 - tutorials about reinforcement learning
53:36 - the recent advances that you might have
53:38 - seen with things like deep mind and it's
53:42 - Bach that learned to beat all the Atari
53:45 - games
53:45 - those were developed with a style of
53:48 - reinforcement learning called a deep cue
53:50 - learning which uses a neural network and
53:55 - trains the neural network based on this
53:59 - reward based system so you have this
54:01 - idea of in reinforcement learning that
54:04 - you have a world the world is going to
54:06 - be in our case the world of flappy bird
54:08 - the world has a given state the agent or
54:14 - the entity that is being reinforced
54:17 - trained me that is learning based on
54:20 - that state just taught decides to make
54:23 - an action I'm going to jump up I'm going
54:26 - to not jump up in this case if I bird is
54:28 - very simple and then based on that there
54:31 - is a reward that reward is fed back into
54:36 - the system and we kind of repeat here
54:39 - now here's the pig this is what makes
54:40 - deep reinforcement learning and other
54:44 - reinforcement learning scenarios very
54:46 - complicated let's just think about this
54:48 - in the case of flappy bird I am a bird I
54:52 - am over here I now this is the state the
54:56 - state could just be the pixels of the
54:58 - display and that's in fact what was used
55:00 - in this in the deep mind project I
55:07 - rewire my brain I am a bird and I am
55:15 - looking at the state and evaluating the
55:17 - state I'm going to choose to make an
55:19 - action that choice is to jump up I now
55:23 - expect my reward please everybody shower
55:25 - me with your gifts I have made this
55:27 - wonderful decision to jump up the
55:28 - problem is how do I know if that was a
55:30 - good or bad decision
55:31 - I don't really right now I don't until
55:33 - much later I don't the payoff for
55:37 - certain things that I might do in a game
55:39 - scenario how do I know if I'm you know
55:44 - if what's another what's another example
55:46 - of this chess how do I know if I'm
55:56 - playing say the game chess if this move
55:59 - is really gonna be a good move for way
56:01 - down the line this is something I really
56:04 - need to be to figure out I think it's
56:07 - very complicated very quickly the good
56:09 - news is I can use a different system I
56:11 - can say you know what instead of trying
56:14 - to actually figure out whether it was a
56:16 - good or bad decision I'm just going to
56:18 - make a whole lot of these birds maybe
56:22 - like a thousand of them they will all
56:24 - have random neural networks random
56:26 - neural networks they will just make
56:28 - random decision
56:29 - and maybe some of those random decisions
56:31 - happen to be better than some of the
56:33 - other random decisions I will then take
56:35 - those into a new generation and
56:37 - repopulate the world with a hundred new
56:39 - birds based off of those ones that did
56:41 - well over and over and over again this
56:43 - same principles of a genetic algorithm
56:45 - so now I might refer to if you have not
56:48 - ever worked with a genetic algorithm
56:49 - before I prefer to you to mine the
56:51 - gather of the tutorial series timeout
56:54 - for a second okay all right everything's
57:09 - fine having a little little inside joke
57:13 - with myself okay all right let me just
57:22 - check to see any questions so far I kind
57:33 - of want to do that again because I took
57:35 - too long I also want to just quickly I
57:43 - want to make sure I reference some work
57:45 - that has come before me in this area so
57:49 - I want to have this link open and
57:51 - available to myself okay
58:01 - all right okay
58:19 - hold on hold on okay got it got it got
58:31 - it okay I yes
58:37 - so Simon in the chat is mentioning who's
58:40 - saying that is not reinforcement
58:43 - learning that is neuro evolution exactly
58:47 - so what I'm doing in this demonstration
58:50 - is akin similar to reinforcement
58:54 - learning in that I am using neural
58:56 - evolution to Train an agent to find an
58:59 - optimal strategy to a game which is
59:01 - exactly what reinforcement learning is
59:03 - often used for and I am just going to do
59:09 - something here and there we go okay
59:16 - moving right along
59:18 - thank you about you for figuring out
59:20 - edit all this extra noise stuff out
59:22 - let's see what's next okay okay so let's
59:36 - go and write a little bit of code and
59:38 - then we're gonna have to come back here
59:39 - just with the whiteboard I know in a
59:41 - second but let's let's start doing a
59:42 - little bit of code here so I'm gonna go
59:44 - into the code I'm gonna go into the bird
59:46 - class and right here I'm noticing okay
59:48 - this is the function that causes the
59:53 - bird to jump up how is that currently
59:55 - decided that is currently decided in
59:57 - sketch KS here when I press a key this
60:02 - will no longer be the case this entire
60:04 - function is now going to be commented
60:06 - out I want the bird to make its own
60:09 - decision whether it should jump up or
60:11 - not so now I'm gonna go over here and
60:15 - I'm going to say this dot brain equals
60:21 - new neural network so the idea here is
60:25 - that the inside the bird object the bird
60:29 - object will have it
60:31 - neural network and its neural network
60:33 - will be the thing that makes the
60:34 - decision whether it should jump or not
60:36 - I'm remembering this is not an original
60:39 - idea I have of course I will include
60:42 - some links in this video's description
60:43 - to other references and papers on neuro
60:45 - evolution but I also want to briefly
60:47 - just point out a bunch of these links
60:49 - which are here these are some other
60:54 - neuro evolution demonstrations that are
60:56 - on github from various other github
60:58 - users there's a floppy learning one and
61:00 - asteroids learning one the steering
61:01 - agent snake neuro-evolutionary ssin
61:04 - playing Super Mario so I'll include
61:05 - links to all these as well as well some
61:08 - of these papers and other resources in
61:09 - the video description ok so now here's
61:14 - the thing if you watched any of my
61:17 - neural network tutorials you might have
61:19 - might remember that what do I need to
61:21 - put in here I need to say how many
61:24 - inputs I need to say how many outputs
61:27 - and I need to say how many hidden nodes
61:32 - so what goes in there this is whatever
61:35 - we have to return to the white board ok
61:38 - so here's the thing this is the game
61:42 - flappy bird I'm going to now architect
61:47 - my neural network down here I need a
61:50 - bunch of inputs I need a bunch of hit in
61:52 - and I need a bunch of outputs let's go
61:56 - with the easy part first the easy part
61:59 - here is perhaps the outputs so let's say
62:02 - I was playing I wanted to train an agent
62:05 - to play a game that used the arrow keys
62:07 - so the the the player of the game can
62:11 - either move up down left or right
62:12 - there's four option I would have four
62:14 - outputs
62:15 - I want a vector with four outputs each
62:18 - representing the probability or the
62:20 - confidence score of whether it's the
62:23 - play the agent should move up move down
62:25 - move left or right in this case I don't
62:28 - need for the only decision is jump or
62:30 - don't jump in this case I really only
62:32 - need one output right I can have one
62:34 - output that ranges between 0 and 1 if
62:36 - it's greater than 0.5 jump if it's less
62:39 - than 0.5 don't jump let's just do that
62:41 - so let's do that that's going to make
62:44 - our life so much easier so I'm just
62:46 - gonna have one output oh so simple we'll
62:49 - do some other I'll do some other
62:50 - examples in other videos with more
62:51 - complexity one output now how many
62:56 - inputs this gets a little harder now
62:59 - wouldn't it be nice if I could write
63:02 - some generic code that's basically going
63:05 - to work for any game as long as I have a
63:07 - way of evaluating the score of the game
63:09 - the same code will work for everything
63:12 - and one way of doing that would actually
63:14 - be the pixels of the game as inputs so
63:18 - maybe I take the the visuals of the game
63:21 - I sample it down to a lower resolution
63:24 - image i flatten that into an array I
63:26 - take the brightness of every pixel I
63:27 - feed that in as the inputs that's
63:29 - certainly one thing I could do I would
63:30 - love to try that as an experiment in as
63:33 - a counterpoint of the way I'm going to
63:35 - do it in this video I'm instead going to
63:37 - take somewhat of a higher level approach
63:41 - and I'm gonna do some feature extraction
63:43 - manually with my brain I'm going to say
63:46 - that I think I do have this oh I
63:59 - shouldn't use this headband to erase
64:01 - that's a bad idea
64:03 - alright I have a paper towel I will use
64:05 - that I'm going to decide that I think
64:12 - that the important properties the inputs
64:16 - should be the Y location of the bird the
64:23 - X location of the closest pipe the Y
64:29 - location of the top pipe and the Y
64:33 - location of the bottom pipe how many
64:36 - inputs is that for so I'm going to have
64:41 - 1 2 3 4 inputs and 1 output and I don't
64:47 - really need to have these bracket things
64:53 - here
64:56 - okay so I've decided how many inputs and
65:01 - how many outputs so now the other
65:03 - question is how many hidden nodes should
65:06 - I have this is a very complicated
65:14 - problem this might work was just one
65:16 - hidden node it might work
65:19 - with no hidden layer at all even in fact
65:22 - it might work with just two of these
65:24 - inputs and be able to figure it out but
65:26 - let's just decide that we're also gonna
65:29 - use four just for the sake of having
65:32 - some hidden nodes we can experiment does
65:33 - it work better if I make 64 hidden or
65:35 - four or eight trial and error is your
65:37 - friend machine learning systems okay so
65:41 - now this is now the diagram of the
65:45 - neural network I must sit here and
65:50 - connect all of the various lines alright
65:55 - so the inputs come in here and the
65:58 - output comes in here for inputs for
66:01 - hidden one output if you want to learn
66:06 - more about how a neural network works
66:08 - all of the internals that are going on
66:09 - here what all these connections are in
66:11 - the weights refer you back to my neural
66:13 - network tutorial series but this is
66:14 - pretty similar also to what I did in the
66:16 - color predictor there were three inputs
66:17 - and two outputs I can't remember all
66:20 - right all right so now we've decided
66:27 - that I want to have four inputs four
66:33 - hidden nodes and one output so we now
66:36 - have the brain of our bird and then in
66:40 - updates the bird is going to decide oh
66:46 - oh this is more complicated than I
66:50 - thought let's write a new function let's
66:52 - write a function called think so in
66:55 - think basically what I want to do is I
66:57 - want to say let the output equal the
67:01 - this dot brain predict and I want to
67:05 - send in the inputs so for example the
67:07 - inputs have to be an
67:09 - array of four numbers right so they
67:16 - would look like something like this I'm
67:17 - gonna put them in there and then I'm
67:19 - just gonna say and if the output is
67:24 - greater than 0.5 then this dot up right
67:30 - so this is the idea here
67:31 - that the neural network library that I'm
67:34 - using has a function called predict when
67:37 - I call that function I send in the
67:40 - inputs the inputs go feed through times
67:45 - the weights some activation function
67:47 - times the weights some activation
67:49 - function I get the output and based on
67:52 - that output if it's greater than 0.5 the
67:55 - bird jumps if it's less than 0.5 the
67:57 - bird doesn't do anything but this is no
68:00 - good here right this is just B let's
68:02 - just see if this works though I mean
68:04 - these are hard-coded inputs that never
68:06 - change that's not what I want but let's
68:08 - just at least see if I don't get any
68:09 - errors so I'm gonna in here now I'm
68:12 - gonna I'm gonna add something I'm gonna
68:14 - say bird dot Fink and I'm going to run
68:17 - the sketch again
68:19 - look look at that it's thinking it's
68:21 - jumping right it decided every time it's
68:25 - basically always going to be up at the
68:26 - top or at the bottom right because it's
68:28 - getting the same inputs over and over
68:30 - again now what I need to do is actually
68:32 - make inputs out of these values these
68:37 - values its Y position top bottom and the
68:41 - x position of the pipe okay let's do
68:43 - that
68:43 - so now I'm going to say digit it back in
68:49 - the bird I'm gonna say let inputs equal
68:53 - an empty array I'm going to say inputs 0
68:57 - is this birds Y position Y position
69:05 - inputs 1 is oh boy okay here's the
69:09 - problem now I need to know about the
69:12 - pipes so I am a bird and I need to know
69:15 - about the pipes how do I do that
69:18 - so maybe what I'll do is I'll take in as
69:21 - an argument to this funk
69:23 - I will take in the pipes array so that
69:28 - is sent into the pink function now I'm
69:31 - gonna go here and I'm gonna say I'm just
69:35 - gonna do pipes index 0 this is a bad
69:38 - idea but let's just start with this
69:39 - pipes index 0 top inputs to equal pipes
69:46 - index 0 bottom inputs 3 equal pipes
69:53 - index 0 X right so this is the idea here
69:59 - I want all of those things to be the
70:01 - inputs to the neural network I don't
70:03 - need this anymore right because I am
70:07 - getting them from the properties that's
70:08 - it and now let me run this and see what
70:10 - happens
70:10 - yeah it's kind of jumping all the time
70:15 - it's kind of jumping all the time
70:17 - alright so this did enjoy seeing the
70:19 - Bravo look oh it's doing something that
70:21 - would actually kind of look did
70:22 - something and make some its own
70:23 - decisions this that was very exciting
70:25 - all right
70:26 - well what I've got some problems here
70:28 - number one is when I sort of made my
70:30 - pretend version of it I purposely made
70:33 - numbers between 0 & 1 so one thing I
70:35 - should really do is normalize all these
70:37 - values that's a pretty typical thing to
70:39 - sort of clean your data so what I'm
70:41 - going to do is I'm say this dot Y
70:42 - divided by height this dot top divided
70:45 - by height and this on the pipes bottom
70:48 - divided by height and the pipes X
70:50 - divided by width so let's do that and
70:56 - identify
70:58 - let's get rid of this now you know does
71:00 - this nothing really different is gonna
71:02 - happen here I'm gonna run this a bunch
71:04 - of times oh that was a good one right
71:08 - those are pretty good fun all right so
71:11 - you can see that it's doing something
71:12 - it's trying to think but I've got
71:14 - another problem I don't know is pipes 0
71:17 - the right pipe I think I need to I
71:20 - probably need an algorithm to check
71:22 - which pipe is actually the one closest
71:24 - when you remember let me look at the
71:25 - main sketch how do I add the pipes yeah
71:28 - so first of all the pipes are getting
71:29 - added to the end and when did the if the
71:32 - pipe goes off-screen it gets deleted
71:34 - from its spot
71:36 - which would typically be the earliest
71:38 - one so he might work but let's let's be
71:46 - smart about this let's actually let's
71:47 - just say that I'm probably this is
71:50 - probably overdoing it but let's actually
71:52 - find the closest pipe so I'm gonna
71:57 - assume the closest pipe is pipes index 0
72:01 - then I am going to look at all of the
72:05 - pipes starting with 1 and I'm gonna say
72:09 - oh actually you know what let's do this
72:14 - and I want closest different closest D
72:20 - being the closest distance to be the
72:22 - absolute value of this X minus closest X
72:30 - ok then I'm going to say let D equal we
72:36 - can start with 1 here
72:39 - absolute value of this X minus closest
72:46 - closest X and if d is less than closest
72:53 - D then the closest is that particular
72:58 - pipe and the closest D is that new
73:02 - distance so this is a little quick
73:04 - algorithm find the closest pipe here's
73:08 - the thing though I don't want to pipe if
73:10 - it's gone behind me already that one
73:12 - shouldn't matter I got an idea let's get
73:15 - rid of that absolute value thing right
73:20 - because as long as the distance is so
73:32 - what I can do if ok the pipes X minus my
73:35 - x it's positive if it's over here and I
73:38 - want that to be a lower lower number but
73:40 - I don't want it to be negative so as
73:42 - long as D is less than closest D and D
73:45 - is greater than 0 then we're fine
73:48 - but what if this
73:50 - is negative but it wouldn't be at the
73:53 - beginning oh but what just hang out for
73:58 - a second I have to stretch I'm looking
74:05 - at the will fail on the Bertus between
74:07 - two pipes you should use an array of
74:09 - raycast in front of the burners input
74:11 - distance between obstacle like how
74:12 - self-driving car works yeah she does
74:16 - probably what I should do
74:23 - closest equals PI this not X oh yeah and
74:27 - that should be pipes index I yeah
74:30 - I have a type on line 34 yes I do well
74:34 - as the X version the bird is smaller
74:35 - than the pipes Y position yeah so okay a
74:42 - couple of mistakes here one is this
74:44 - should be pipes index I I'm going to
74:46 - change this to say closest is no and the
74:50 - closest distance is infinity I love that
74:53 - you could type infinity in JavaScript
74:54 - like knows what that is that's a number
74:58 - it could store in memory but what I'm
75:00 - actually going to do here I think this
75:01 - will work now and then I can start with
75:03 - 0 right so as long as it is in front of
75:06 - it that's the closest one so now I can
75:11 - say instead of pipes index 0 I'm going
75:13 - to say closest down here I'm gonna say
75:18 - closest here and closest here and here
75:22 - we go now we are ready
75:24 - Oh cannot read properly top of null all
75:28 - right so what's going on here
75:32 - this dot X minus pipes index I and D is
75:38 - greater than 0 what do I have wrong here
75:48 - because as long as there's at least one
75:50 - pipe you should always get that first
75:56 - one this dot X oh boy
76:01 - [Laughter]
76:05 - oops so the way I program this I've got
76:08 - I've got to say pipe school I took out
76:10 - the absolute value I've got to say pipes
76:12 - index I - this dot x right because I
76:18 - want it to be positive like the pipe
76:20 - pipe pipe pipe pipe everything goes past
76:21 - it okay this should be fine uh hmm
76:27 - or not Oh X dot X pipe - next I dot X
76:33 - okay there we go so I can do this a
76:37 - bunch of times and we can see I'm gonna
76:39 - get a bunch of random birds that are
76:40 - doing sort of random things whoo all
76:43 - right I think this is gonna be a
76:44 - multi-partner coding challenge I am now
76:46 - wrapping up the end of this first part
76:48 - because just to summarize what have I
76:50 - done so far I have built a system where
76:54 - I have the game flappy bird I have
76:57 - developed a neural network architecture
76:59 - for the bird to read in the state sort
77:03 - of evaluate the state of the game make a
77:06 - guess as to what it should do should it
77:08 - jump up should it not based on that and
77:10 - then I have put that into motion that
77:12 - neural network is part of the bird
77:16 - object now it has a brain for 401 and
77:19 - then it has a think function which sends
77:23 - the data about the gain into the neural
77:24 - network and decides to go up or not now
77:28 - what I need to do is actually implement
77:32 - the neuro evolution part so I've been
77:35 - implemented the neuro part I designed a
77:38 - way for the bird to make a decision
77:39 - based on how its evaluating the scene
77:42 - and what I need to do now is make a
77:44 - population of them and try them all and
77:47 - evolve them over time so I'm going to
77:49 - take a little break here I'm going to
77:51 - meditate for a minute on how much my
77:54 - brain doesn't work as well as a simple
77:56 - multi-layer perceptron
77:58 - and I will be back in the next video to
78:00 - actually implement the genetic algorithm
78:02 - part thank you for tuning in and being
78:04 - on this journey with me all right
78:17 - ah yes Eric points out the numbers for
78:23 - the pipes are going to be the same for
78:24 - every bird so do that part in the draw
78:28 - loop that's true I think however this
78:34 - that's a nice optimization and
78:36 - efficiency but in terms of demonstrating
78:38 - this idea for games where the agents
78:41 - would be in different places and would
78:42 - actually have kind of different inputs I
78:45 - think I'm gonna just leave it there
78:46 - because it's fast enough I mean there's
78:48 - not it's not this algorithm is nothing
78:50 - that's really gonna be slow there's like
78:51 - two or three pipes every time all right
78:58 - I just I feel like can I just really
79:05 - just I can't because I don't have time I
79:07 - just I I wasn't happy with how that went
79:09 - maybe not sure you can like edit it in
79:11 - such a way that I'll feel less like I
79:14 - was lost it's fine I kind of want to do
79:19 - this I have this sort of thing where for
79:22 - so I noticed that if I make a coding
79:24 - challenge that I shouldn't worry about
79:25 - this but my coding challenges that are
79:27 - just one part get viewed a lot more than
79:32 - if they're multi-part but I shouldn't be
79:34 - optimizing for views I should be
79:36 - optimizing for making good useful
79:37 - content and this needs to be in multiple
79:39 - parts I mean I couldn't make it in one
79:41 - part but then it'll be an hour or so
79:42 - video and I think it's better to break
79:44 - it up alright I don't know I never know
79:47 - what to do your predict method returns
79:49 - an array oh boy that is such a good
79:53 - point oh my goodness
79:56 - Christopher thank you you're predictable
79:59 - it returns an eraser oh that's the first
80:01 - thing I need to fix that's the first
80:05 - thing I need to fix in the next video
80:07 - interest let me just check it see if
80:08 - it's actually like the behavior
80:12 - weirdly just curious just curious to
80:26 - evaluate this for a second see what kind
80:29 - of numbers it's getting yeah
80:46 - okay
80:52 - all right you just fix the fact that I
80:57 - have a lunatic in post please thank you
80:59 - very much I'm sure that'll be possible
81:02 - all right what time is it 3 o'clock we
81:05 - gotta get moving player folks 45 minutes
81:07 - I can do this 45 minutes I got through
81:08 - the main part all right I don't think
81:15 - that's doing anything I really wanted
81:24 - that console.log is making me crazy
81:31 - know why it's making me crazy but it
81:33 - bothers me all right
81:35 - why am I not using to output I probably
81:38 - should have used two outputs yeah I when
81:46 - I made my example I did use two outputs
81:50 - but hopefully it'll work with just one
81:51 - output all right I'm gonna keep moving
81:52 - on here all right
82:11 - let's reset the cameras the cameras not
82:16 - go off during that whole time period it
82:19 - seems impossible that that wasn't yeah I
82:22 - know I removed this zero I did that on
82:24 - purpose because it's got to be in the
82:25 - next section it's so sad
82:32 - because I get that over there and it was
82:33 - like perfect it slipped and I caught it
82:35 - it was like really cool looking cool I
82:38 - was like oh I wasn't in the right camera
82:41 - we just go over here and show my my
82:46 - manual dexterity okay never mind moving
82:48 - on I am back for part two of neuro
82:55 - evolution with floppy train I don't know
82:58 - slappy something you can see here I now
83:02 - have this neural network which is
83:05 - driving this circle it's not really
83:10 - working so the problem is I only have
83:12 - one I need to make a population of them
83:14 - so that I can pick and choose the ones
83:17 - that are making smart decisions somehow
83:19 - and making their way through this maze
83:21 - of pipes but before I even do that in
83:24 - the chat thank you - Christopher
83:26 - mistake was pointed out which is that I
83:29 - forgot that my neural network library
83:32 - just like it expects as its inputs an
83:36 - array of values it expect it gives you
83:40 - back as its output an array of values
83:42 - and I forgot about that because even if
83:44 - it's one value it's still coming back in
83:46 - an array so I need to say index zero
83:52 - here so what I want to know is that
83:54 - first element of the array is it greater
83:57 - than 0.5 or not the truth of the matter
83:59 - is nothing's really happening yet kind
84:01 - of getting the same so but you can see
84:04 - things are possible all right so now
84:06 - let's see what we can do here the first
84:10 - thing that I need to do is I'm going to
84:12 - make a new JavaScript file and I'm gonna
84:16 - call this G AJ s so I'm not gonna make a
84:19 - population class or genetic algorithm
84:21 - class I have a would like to at some
84:23 - point refactor
84:24 - what I'm doing here into a more a
84:26 - package way that you might be able to
84:28 - just like use it as a library as part of
84:29 - the toy neural network library has some
84:31 - functionality for genetic algorithms
84:32 - built into it but I'm just gonna write
84:34 - all the raw code here and the main thing
84:36 - that I need to do first is I need to
84:39 - change the idea of having a single bird
84:40 - too many birds and I want to use cons
84:46 - it's so exciting when I use Const I'm
84:49 - gonna make a population total total I'll
84:52 - just call this like total and I'll make
84:54 - it 100 so what I'm going to do here is
84:57 - I'm going to say I equals 0 I is less
85:00 - than total and then I plus plus so I'm
85:04 - going to make a population of birds
85:06 - birds index I is a new bird then what
85:11 - I'm gonna do here is I have let me just
85:15 - do this here for let bird of birds I'm
85:21 - going to use that for of loop to just
85:24 - loop through and have every bird think
85:26 - update and show now I haven't done that
85:27 - I gotta fix this thing with the pipes so
85:30 - let me just comment this out for a
85:31 - second but let's at least see all the
85:33 - whole population going so you can see
85:37 - yeah that's kind of interesting it's
85:39 - definitely like there but they're doing
85:40 - different stuff now they really are yeah
85:51 - well done I just I got to think for a
85:54 - second now in my example version of this
85:57 - that I made this is a pause moment for a
85:59 - second if I go to my example that I made
86:05 - for my class a while back when it starts
86:12 - there really like a much bigger variety
86:15 - of stuff happening so one thing is let
86:20 - me change the transparency a little bit
86:22 - but was there anything else that I'm
86:23 - doing in this example that would that
86:27 - I'm forgotten about here could it
86:28 - possibly just be that having two outputs
86:30 - is actually gives more variety
86:38 - all right so I'm gonna I got to think
86:40 - about this all right so one thing I want
86:49 - to do here just visually I want to be
86:51 - able to get a better sense of the birds
86:53 - so I'm gonna look at the birds show
86:55 - function and I'm gonna say stroke 255
86:58 - and fill 255 comma 50 like I'm gonna
87:01 - give them some alpha so you can see that
87:04 - most of them are doing exactly the same
87:06 - thing ah there we go there's sort of a
87:08 - variety there I'm just kind of a little
87:12 - suspicious here let me try two outputs
87:14 - let me see if two outputs actually
87:16 - yields some more unique results so in
87:19 - that case with two outputs what I
87:21 - actually just want to do is something
87:22 - like if output 0 is greater than output
87:25 - 1 so let's try that for a second yeah
87:30 - it's kind of the same maybe I just want
87:35 - to have a bigger population yeah there
87:42 - we go just had a bigger population so I
87:44 - just want have a bigger population
87:44 - because I'm gonna need more
87:46 - possibilities okay so now here's the
87:48 - thing I need to do something else rather
87:50 - important I need to eliminate any birds
87:54 - when they no longer when they when they
87:59 - hit one of the pipes so now what I need
88:00 - to do is as I'm going through here I
88:03 - also want to say for let J equal birds
88:07 - dot Birds dot length minus 1 J is
88:11 - greater than equal to 0 J minus minus
88:13 - and I could use filter or something but
88:16 - I'm not gonna use filter I'm gonna come
88:19 - back to that another time and then what
88:21 - I want to do is I want to say I want to
88:22 - have this if pipes index I hits Birds
88:30 - index J birds dot splice J comma 1 so
88:39 - this is now me deleting any birds that
88:42 - stopped living there that hit one of the
88:46 - pipes so let's run this and see oh
88:48 - sketch such as error
88:50 - oops I forgot a semicolon here okay
88:53 - let's try this all right so let's see
88:55 - here and see if we can get to anything
88:56 - making none of them making it through
89:01 - that's not a good sign so I would like
89:04 - to at least kind of live in a world
89:07 - where so I'm gonna make it a little
89:09 - easier for them right now
89:11 - in pipe I'm gonna make this I'm increase
89:15 - the spacing to 175 so I'm just gonna
89:18 - make that space between the pipes a
89:20 - little bit easier oh yeah one made it
89:22 - through because I just want to at least
89:25 - kind of increase the chances that there
89:28 - will be some that outperform others
89:29 - right and somewhat random but let's
89:31 - let's see oh this is good okay so we're
89:34 - getting somewhere now what I need to do
89:37 - is I need to think what are the things I
89:38 - need to think about when I have a
89:39 - genetic algorithm timeout for a second
89:45 - is there like a yeah yeah different
90:04 - colors is a good idea so I should do
90:06 - that okay thinking thinking I think I
90:15 - need some water
90:31 - so shadow plays and the chat is saying
90:33 - dan you should input the distance from
90:35 - the pipe and the bird - well that is
90:38 - important I'm basically getting that by
90:39 - the nature of the pipes exposition
90:41 - because the bird never moves so if I
90:43 - know the pipes exposition I know the
90:44 - distance so the neural network should be
90:46 - able to kind of learn from that I also
90:49 - just make a much bigger population but
90:50 - all right okay so a couple things number
90:58 - one is I know I'm going to need to have
91:00 - a new generation
91:01 - so let's actually let's let's let's
91:05 - write a function called
91:06 - next generation and just for right now I
91:11 - just want to get sort of like the
91:12 - process going here for next generation
91:14 - I'm gonna say four let I equals 0 I is
91:18 - less than total I plus plus Birds index
91:21 - I equals a new bird a new bird and I
91:27 - know that in the main program if at any
91:33 - point whoops if at any point Birds dot
91:38 - length equals zero then call next
91:42 - generation so now if I run this we
91:46 - should see that at least it's going to
91:47 - let these run as long as there are some
91:50 - birds and then uh next-gen an X
91:53 - Federation is not defined because I
91:55 - forgot to add it here to my index.html
91:58 - file so I need yet another JavaScript
92:03 - file I'm going to call it G ajs ok so
92:06 - now as soon as all of the birds run out
92:09 - Oh - made it through oh come on whoops
92:17 - did I forget to like it save next
92:21 - generation I say call it new generation
92:26 - No next generation oh I know what the
92:32 - problem is
92:33 - oh why do I make these errors I put it
92:37 - in live
92:38 - /g eh okay sure come on let's move along
92:41 - folks all right one more time
92:43 - let's with feeling everybody oh look at
92:45 - those two birds maybe their genius that
92:48 - is a genius bird already okay so you get
93:01 - the idea here
93:01 - now I haven't involved as a Realty this
93:03 - is very exciting for me at life it's
93:06 - very strange okay so what I need to do
93:08 - though is this is no good I don't just
93:10 - want to make a whole nest new set of new
93:13 - birds I want to evolve them from the
93:15 - previous generation so in order to do
93:17 - that I need some sort of fitness and so
93:20 - I'm gonna build into each bird object
93:23 - I'm gonna give it a score and also a
93:27 - fitness and I know it's probably not
93:30 - necessary for me to have two variables
93:31 - but the way I'm thinking about it right
93:32 - now this is gonna make it easier and so
93:34 - the idea that the longer a bird lives
93:38 - the more it increases its core so in
93:42 - update right every time update gets
93:45 - called it should get another point so
93:49 - I'm gonna say this dot score plus plus
93:50 - okay so every time update is called its
93:53 - score goes up and then what I want to do
93:57 - at the beginning of next generation is I
94:00 - want to calculate a fitness for every
94:02 - single bird and I want that I want all
94:05 - those Fitness to all those Fitness
94:07 - values to be normalized between zero and
94:10 - one and add up to one and if you watch
94:12 - them my previous genetic algorithm
94:14 - tutorials you'll see why I'm doing that
94:15 - I need each fitness value to be a
94:17 - probability that it gets picked for the
94:19 - next generation so the first thing I'm
94:21 - going to do in next generation is I'm
94:24 - going to calculate all the Fitness
94:26 - values so let me break this out into
94:28 - some functions calculate Fitness so in
94:35 - calculate Fitness what I'm going to do
94:39 - is for every bird I am going to first I
94:44 - need to do is get the sum so I want to
94:46 - say I know I could use the higher-order
94:47 - array function here my brain doesn't
94:50 - think that way
94:51 - some plus equal Birds score so what I
94:55 - want to do is first add up all the
94:56 - scores then for each bird I want to say
95:02 - bird dot fitness equals its own personal
95:06 - score divided by that some so this is a
95:09 - way of kind of calculating and
95:12 - normalizing all the fitness values now
95:14 - maybe I need to make this exponential in
95:16 - some way or be you know power law or
95:19 - some kind of fits your way to think
95:21 - about how the score master Fitness but
95:23 - this is I'm just gonna would use this
95:24 - sort of like linear way of doing it
95:25 - right now
95:25 - I could square the score so let's see
95:28 - fitness equals bird score divided by
95:30 - some so this works for calculating all
95:32 - the fitness values now I've calculated
95:35 - all the Fitness values I then need to
95:37 - boy I'm moving right along here then
95:39 - what I need to do is I need to pick all
95:43 - right all right all right let's hold on
95:46 - for a second here time out I'm gonna go
95:51 - to my I have a genetic I know where it
95:58 - is
96:07 - we Kate GA slides download
96:43 - my battery's at 100% isn't that nice
96:45 - alright so if you remember from it a few
96:50 - if you happen to watch any of my genetic
96:52 - algorithm tutorials I go through this
96:54 - presentation which walks through the
96:56 - actual algorithm itself so what I need
96:59 - to do so I have evaluated the fitness of
97:01 - each element of the population but here
97:03 - if you look at the next step I need to
97:05 - make the new population I need to ever
97:08 - end times pick two parents with a
97:10 - probability according to relative
97:12 - fitness this is so that I can apply this
97:13 - idea of crossover take half of the DNA
97:16 - of one and half of the DNA and of others
97:18 - and mix them together here's the thing
97:20 - I'm gonna for the purpose of this video
97:22 - do a simplified version of crossover one
97:26 - way that I could do a simplified version
97:27 - of crossover is not to cross over at all
97:30 - instead of taking two elements and
97:32 - combining them I could just take one
97:34 - element and make a copy so I'm gonna
97:35 - take the ones that do well and just make
97:37 - a copy of them and the reason why this
97:39 - is going to be so easy is because I
97:41 - already have as part of the neural oh no
97:49 - yes why did this camera go away it's on
97:56 - it oh it became loose cable got loose
98:01 - because I already have as part of the
98:06 - neural over here as part of the neural
98:08 - network class itself a copy function and
98:11 - guess what I have a mutate function and
98:13 - if I come back over here we're going to
98:15 - see the next step is mutate you take the
98:17 - child's DNA based on a given probability
98:18 - so this is what's nice that I did this
98:20 - in a previous video I added these things
98:22 - to the neural network library that I'm
98:24 - using so now I'm going to go back oh and
98:27 - let me just minimize this I'm going to
98:28 - come back here and I'm gonna say instead
98:31 - of just making any new bird I need to
98:35 - pick one I need to write a function pick
98:41 - one that is going to somehow return one
98:44 - of the birds based on the with a
98:47 - probability map to its fitness so here's
98:50 - the thing we're all the birds where of
98:54 - all the birds gone
98:56 - I kept deleting them any time they'd hit
99:01 - up I deleted it I deleted it here's the
99:04 - problem I think I need a backup what's
99:07 - gonna be nice here is they let birds
99:08 - equal an empty array I'm having an array
99:13 - called saved birds and I guess what I
99:19 - could do is maybe what I'll do this is a
99:21 - little bit silly but every time I delete
99:24 - one I'll just say saved Birds dot push
99:28 - pipe cuz I pretty sure if you delete
99:31 - something from the array it it it gives
99:35 - you it returns right if I say pipes
99:39 - index 0 dot splice 1 whoops sorry
99:45 - pipes splice 1 0 comma 1 right I get
99:52 - that pipe object it gives me that pipe
99:54 - object it gives it to me as an array so
99:56 - what I need to do but I think I can push
99:58 - the array into it and so this should
100:00 - work right if I now have if I make an
100:07 - array which is an empty array and then I
100:11 - say eh okay I know the picked one here
100:17 - hold on no loop thank you very much no
100:22 - ok now I can do what I want I can do
100:25 - whatever I want
100:26 - a dot so let P equal pipe splice 0 1 so
100:34 - P is this array with one pipe into it
100:36 - then I could say let a be an array a dot
100:39 - push P and so now only let's do it a is
100:45 - Oh a is an array with one thing with a
100:47 - pipe in it so that works alright just
100:49 - testing out my idea so what I can do now
100:51 - is when I'm done I'm back to sketch
100:55 - right as I'm removing the birds I can
100:58 - save them so that now when I go into the
101:03 - genetic algorithm pick one I can use I
101:06 - can pick one out of the save Birds so
101:08 - let me just for the sake of our
101:10 - just say let a child equal random saved
101:16 - saved birds return I just want to see
101:21 - that this works alright so I'm just
101:23 - gonna this is not I'm not using the
101:25 - Fitness yet as a probability but I just
101:27 - want to pick a random one just to see
101:28 - that the workflow works return child
101:31 - so birds index and then I'm also gonna
101:34 - say child dot mutate zero point I'm
101:39 - gonna have a 1% mutation chance so I'm
101:41 - gonna let it you take a 10% when if you
101:44 - take 10% of the weights of the neural
101:46 - network and then I'm gonna return that
101:47 - so let's just see if this works and then
101:50 - after I've done that I also have to
101:52 - clear the saved Birds so empty that out
101:57 - so this now the neck every time I want
102:00 - to make a new generation I should
102:01 - calculate all the fitness function
102:02 - values I should pick I should get
102:05 - however many new Birds clear out the SAV
102:08 - birds and go again so here we go as I'm
102:12 - waiting for the next generation come on
102:15 - birds you're doing too well ah child
102:18 - mutate is not a function ah child and of
102:23 - course child on you Tate is not a
102:25 - function oh oh boy I just realized
102:33 - what's going on here time around for a
102:38 - second
102:42 - oh really is this not working the way
102:47 - that I think it is that it's not
102:49 - actually like if I look at save birds
102:54 - right now lips ah what's going on here
102:58 - where did I end up here
103:17 - oh why did I put the pipe in the saved
103:19 - birds that makes no sense I put it in
103:27 - the pipes off-screen oh boy
103:33 - oh why why is coating like this it's
103:38 - much harder when you're trying to do a
103:39 - tutorial and on a live stream do this
103:41 - coding thing oh my goodness
103:43 - that's 320 I got afraid you gotta hurry
103:45 - up alright alright so many brought so
103:49 - many problems with this I don't even
103:51 - know what to say okay there was a little
103:58 - bit of a jump cut because I really went
104:00 - off something like weird direction of it
104:03 - made no sense I don't know if you
104:05 - noticed and we're yelling at that your
104:07 - television machine thing that you're
104:08 - watching me on but for some reason I put
104:11 - this down here I started adding the
104:12 - pipes to the safe birds so apologies for
104:15 - that this is not where that goes the
104:18 - pipes get removed just when they go off
104:21 - screen it's the birds that I want to add
104:24 - to these save birds also I'm not so sure
104:27 - I might be making an array of arrays we
104:30 - just run this for a second and let me
104:34 - let a bunch of birds die and let me look
104:36 - at save birds yeah I made an array of
104:38 - arrays we don't want that we want an
104:40 - array of birds so I could probably use
104:43 - concat but let me just push in the one
104:46 - thing that I'm removing just to fix that
104:49 - and we can see here is there's no birds
104:52 - in there and then now I have an array of
104:54 - birds alright so that's better at least
104:55 - now pick one is still gonna have a
104:58 - problem so why is pick one guy I sort of
105:02 - stopped thinking about what I was doing
105:04 - here I'm taking a bat bird I'm not
105:07 - making a copy of the bird I'm taking
105:09 - that exact bird object and putting it
105:12 - back into the birds array which is fine
105:15 - but if I want to mutate it I need to
105:19 - mutate its brain the neural network so
105:24 - to do that I think what makes them I
105:28 - mean just as a quick I could just
105:31 - like let's write let's put in the bird
105:34 - class itself let's write a mutate
105:38 - function and mute a function I would say
105:41 - this dot brain mutate zero point one so
105:44 - I'm just gonna kind of have this
105:45 - hard-coded in here that when a bird
105:47 - mutates its brain mutates
105:49 - and I think I can get away without
105:51 - actually making a copy of the neural
105:53 - network oh no no no no no I want to make
105:57 - a new bird with the same neural network
106:01 - I think that's gonna be I'm gonna be
106:03 - better off because otherwise I've got to
106:05 - reset all of these numbers and values
106:07 - its velocities got to go back to zero so
106:10 - I don't I want to make a copy of the
106:11 - bird and I kind of want to but I don't
106:13 - really need to make a copy I just need
106:15 - to make a new bird with a brain so if
106:20 - brain right if I create a bird with a
106:24 - brain a bird breaking then I'm gonna say
106:27 - this and I'm gonna make a copy of it
106:29 - just for it's probably unnecessary is
106:34 - brain copy so I'm gonna do that if
106:36 - otherwise if I'm making a bird without a
106:40 - brain I am going to I'm going to just
106:45 - make a bird with a new blank neural
106:46 - network and there's already a copy
106:48 - function that's this way I'm setting
106:50 - myself up for future success if I want
106:52 - to do crossover it's going to be a
106:53 - little bit easier then here what I want
106:56 - to do is in pick one I pick a random
107:01 - bird but I return and then I say let
107:09 - bird equal and then I'm going to say let
107:11 - child equal a new bird with that birds
107:14 - brain oh this is very weird and then I'm
107:18 - going to say child dot mutate okay and
107:22 - then now this should get me the right
107:25 - idea right I'm picking a random bird out
107:27 - of the save birds and making a new bird
107:30 - with the previous birds brain I could do
107:33 - cross over here right if I want to do
107:34 - cross over and then I mutating
107:36 - okay so let's give this a whirl here we
107:39 - go
107:42 - did it did they all die and
107:44 - have a console log for yeah there we go
107:46 - okay so this is working I probably
107:49 - should clear out the pipes so the other
107:51 - thing I should do I think is that would
107:55 - make sense is when also as soon as
107:59 - there's a new generation um I should
108:03 - probably say pipes I just should just
108:07 - like let me just add one pipe and
108:10 - actually you know I'm gonna do I'm gonna
108:12 - make this my own counter this is a
108:14 - little bit unnecessary but I just want
108:17 - to reset the counter back to zero
108:21 - counter plus plus and I'm gonna have a
108:24 - global variable whoops
108:26 - hopefully can't type I'm gonna have a
108:29 - global variable called counter set equal
108:31 - to zero okay so I just want to do that
108:35 - because I want to like I don't want to I
108:38 - mean like I wanted the whole game to
108:41 - restart her two pipes though at the
108:44 - beginning for some reason why is that
108:47 - I'm looking at Sketch j/s because I add
108:51 - a new pipe in setup which I no longer
108:53 - need to do because as long as I put this
108:58 - first in draw now okay there we go
109:01 - okay so now there's one pipe all the
109:04 - birds are trying to play flappy bird as
109:06 - soon as they all go away the whole thing
109:08 - starts over so now we have the work flow
109:10 - we're actually good to go here we are
109:13 - good to go the problem is I need to pick
109:16 - them based on their fitness values
109:18 - here's the good news I have a function
109:21 - this comes from my traveling salesperson
109:23 - coding challenge it comes from this
109:25 - github issue that was filed on August
109:28 - 5th 2016 with this particular algorithm
109:32 - for picking an element from a population
109:35 - based on a given fitness so I'm gonna go
109:37 - over to here actually and I'm gonna grab
109:39 - this exact pick one function and I am
109:44 - going to bring it over and I'm gonna put
109:49 - it in this so if you want to review how
109:51 - this function works in more detail you
109:53 - can go back to my previous videos but
109:55 - I'm just going to paste this right in
109:56 - here
109:58 - and the idea here is that at the end
110:02 - list index is that particular bird that
110:07 - I want and this made it I know I have
110:10 - slice here I can't remember why I did
110:12 - that but basically this what I'm doing
110:17 - here is now instead of picking a random
110:20 - one I'm gonna pick it from that list now
110:24 - I wrote this function with arguments but
110:27 - the good news is I can take this stuff
110:30 - out and what I'm really doing is I'm
110:32 - saying okay birds index dot fitness
110:37 - that's the probability right I'm picking
110:39 - one thing from a list based on
110:41 - probability those were the arguments
110:43 - here I'm picking something for a list
110:44 - based on an array of probabilities so
110:47 - now wherever I see list what I mean is
110:50 - birds and whenever I see probability I
110:53 - mean birds fit fitness the fitness of
110:56 - the bird so this is birds index and I
110:59 - don't know why I have that slice there
111:00 - and then so this is good I'm good there
111:05 - we go so this is an algorithm for
111:08 - choosing a random number and seeing
111:10 - words falls into the sort of spread of
111:13 - all the probability values and again you
111:15 - could go back to my video where I
111:17 - specifically talk through this entire
111:18 - algorithm but I think this is going to
111:20 - do it right now
111:21 - so let's now run this code that's really
111:25 - the last piece and I'm going to let this
111:29 - run for a little while and I know I'm
111:32 - not
111:32 - because cannot read property why of
111:34 - undefined so what what what did I mess
111:37 - up here let's take a look here console
111:41 - dot log bird all right let's see what's
111:47 - happening here piped J s89 even get that
111:52 - far I was so excited that I was done
111:55 - where am I pipe dot j s 18 hits bird and
112:02 - where is that that happened and it's
112:05 - being called in sketchiest line 28 if
112:11 - pipes expert in Luke's Jay save bird
112:15 - splice why the bird doesn't exist hmm oh
112:22 - good thing that happened they might see
112:26 - what I did wrong
112:33 - what did I do wrong
112:45 - choose from saves birds thank you thank
112:51 - you all right I clearly made a mistake
112:55 - thank you - IH o RL in the chat I need
113:01 - to be using saved Birds remember birds
113:03 - has nothing so I need to say saved Birds
113:07 - right save Birds so that is something I
113:11 - definitely need to do is that the
113:13 - problem that I'm having I think I might
113:15 - have a different problem also yeah so I
113:19 - think because once all the birds are
113:21 - gone it's kind of doing this one more
113:25 - time next generation right it seems to
113:36 - only have a problem after I call next
113:37 - generation so I must not be so let me go
113:47 - here let me say console dot log
113:52 - next-generation console dot log Birds
114:00 - let's look and see what's in there let's
114:03 - see what's going on here ok so here we
114:05 - go I really shouldn't make it to the
114:06 - pipe Cubs book quickly because now I
114:09 - have to wait I have two functions called
114:11 - pick one in the code
114:12 - do I not even realize that so have a lot
114:15 - fun to fly I'm a big array of undefined
114:17 - did I leave like oh oh my goodness I
114:21 - left this function in the code
114:25 - why is that there all right let's see if
114:29 - that it was like using this other pic
114:31 - okay next generation all right all right
114:35 - we're getting somewhere now cannot read
114:37 - property fitness of undefined okay so
114:41 - here we go
114:43 - cannot read property fitness of
114:46 - undefined so let's take a look at saved
114:53 - birds and let's take a look at index all
115:09 - right here we go there's a lot of
115:10 - debugging in this particular video all
115:11 - right whoa
115:13 - what line sixteen oh it was going
115:18 - through all this got through all of them
115:24 - weird ah are the fitness while R is
115:31 - greater than zero
115:32 - all right and then what happened
115:36 - and then we got to the end yeah of
115:39 - course because it never so let's look at
115:41 - the array of 250 first of all let's make
115:45 - our life a little bit simpler by just
115:49 - doing this with ten birds while we're
115:50 - trying to debug this in that way we can
115:54 - have an easier time of figuring this out
115:56 - because there's only ten of them so lift
115:59 - velocity there Phil I want to check the
116:02 - fitness values Fitness is values of all
116:04 - these are zero so my fitness
116:06 - calculations somehow messed up let's
116:09 - look at that so let's look at calculate
116:13 - fitness
116:15 - let's console.log some okay let's come
116:22 - to a look some don't wait wait wait
116:27 - zero that's not good bird dot score
116:31 - let's look at all the birds score whoops
116:38 - scores 96 scores 96 so that's right
116:42 - they're getting a score oh I need to do
116:48 - saved birds here saved Birds so
116:52 - everything here has to be saved Birds I
116:54 - probably should do it the other way
116:55 - around okay there we go the Phineas
116:58 - calculation also needs saved birds
117:01 - probably everybody in the Chad's been
117:03 - telling me this for like the last five
117:05 - minutes now I feel pretty confident here
117:11 - I probably shouldn't I'm gonna take out
117:12 - my console logs and let's see what
117:15 - happens let's see can we get to the next
117:17 - generation yes we got to the next
117:19 - generation now am i seeing anything
117:22 - evolve
117:23 - I don't think so cuz I only have ten so
117:24 - let me give me myself a lot more birds
117:30 - let me give myself a lot more Birds back
117:34 - here I'm gonna say let's give myself 350
117:36 - Birds and let's run this sketch all
117:39 - right I'll be back in just a few minutes
117:49 - there's a thousand people watching come
117:55 - on birds
117:55 - you can evolve
118:02 - Oh
118:15 - [Music]
118:20 - what time is it
118:22 - 3:40 I'm doing okay so I am not fully
118:36 - confident that oh I know it's there's a
118:38 - bunch of things I definitely want to
118:39 - improve here alright alright so I'm back
118:48 - it's kind of like big God it got a
118:50 - little bit better but there are some
118:52 - things that I really want to improve
118:53 - here that I know that I'm pretty sure
118:55 - we'll make this perform much better
118:56 - first of all it's pretty silly that I
118:59 - have to sit here and like watch it for
119:01 - like a half or an hour to see if what
119:03 - will evolve and there's something I
119:05 - could do very quickly to speed this up
119:06 - because if you think about it
119:08 - I don't I don't need to draw the game at
119:11 - 30 frames per second I could just run
119:13 - the game really really fast I'm just
119:15 - kind of like show it to me every once in
119:16 - a while so I'm actually going to create
119:18 - I'm gonna create a little slider here I
119:22 - feel like this should be part three I'm
119:24 - gonna make a part three because if I'm
119:27 - making a multi-part I players will have
119:29 - a part three so hold on
119:41 - alright alright so this did okay they
119:48 - seem to be improving there's some good
119:50 - ones in there that are jumping but I'm
119:53 - gonna wrap up this part too or I finally
119:56 - applied the actual genetic algorithm
119:58 - part to evolving the neural network with
120:01 - a population of these things and what
120:03 - I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do one more
120:04 - part where I'm gonna improve this I'm
120:06 - gonna do a few things number one whose
120:07 - speed up the process so I could get it
120:09 - to evolve a lot faster and I'm gonna
120:10 - change the way mutation works which I
120:13 - think will give me a slightly it will
120:14 - help me find an optimal solution a bit
120:17 - faster so come back if you want I will
120:19 - be okay welcome to part three of my
120:30 - neuro evolution flappy bird coding
120:33 - challenge alright so yes oh that looks
120:37 - like it should probably should have hit
120:39 - the pipe there but anyway that aside
120:41 - look at these birds they're really
120:44 - trying to get through those gaps in the
120:46 - pipes
120:46 - alright so I want to do a few things to
120:49 - improve number one this is a bit
120:51 - ridiculous that I have to sit here and
120:53 - wait and let it run it's kind of
120:54 - enjoyable I mean if I would have to go
120:56 - soon so I got to speed this up so here's
120:59 - one thing I'm gonna do to speed this up
121:00 - I am going to I don't need to write all
121:05 - of the logic that's driving the game I
121:07 - could just do that many many times per
121:11 - frame right I don't actually need to
121:14 - draw and show the animation so for
121:17 - example if I were so one thing I need to
121:19 - do is separate out all the logic of the
121:22 - game from the drawing so one thing I'm
121:24 - going to do is I'm going to take out
121:25 - pipes show here let me just this is like
121:29 - counter is part of the game logic
121:33 - looping through all the pipes and
121:35 - checking them that's part of the game
121:36 - looping through all the birds if Birds
121:38 - this is part of the game so what I just
121:41 - put up drawing is not so let me take out
121:43 - bird show and now I'm just gonna at the
121:46 - end here set
121:47 - say let for let bird of birds bird show
121:53 - for let pipe of pipes pipe show this
122:00 - should be exactly the same nothing has
122:02 - changed but now and I might as well take
122:06 - the background and put the background
122:08 - here so this is all the drawing stuff
122:11 - and now what I'm going to do is I'm
122:15 - gonna say for let n equal 0 n is less
122:19 - than cycles a call it cycles see n plus
122:22 - plus I'm going to do all of the game
122:25 - logic stuff
122:26 - many many times oops which goes all the
122:28 - way down to here so and then I'm gonna
122:31 - say let cycles equal 100 so watch this
122:36 - so now this is just like doing it really
122:39 - really fast over time but I want to be
122:42 - able to like speed it up and slow it
122:43 - down also so one thing that I can do to
122:47 - do that is I am going to say let slider
122:51 - slider equals create slider I'm going to
122:56 - make a slider that goes from 1 to 100
122:59 - and starts at 1 and that I'm just gonna
123:04 - say slider dot value so I instead of a
123:06 - variable called cycles I'm just going to
123:09 - use the value of that slider so now I've
123:13 - got a little slider here I can speed
123:15 - things up and I can slow them back down
123:17 - so this is gonna help me a lot where
123:19 - instead of having to like speed up the
123:21 - video that you're watching if I'm
123:22 - editing this after the fact I can
123:24 - actually just do this so in fact I could
123:26 - let this go for a little bit and then I
123:28 - could come back and see like how we
123:30 - doing here we got one that's doing
123:32 - pretty well so but here's the thing I
123:33 - also think there are some things that I
123:35 - really need to do to help the help the
123:38 - evolutionary process along one thing is
123:41 - I'm gonna go into the neural network
123:43 - code and look at how I'm doing mutation
123:46 - so this is the mutate function so first
123:50 - of all I'm a little suspicious here I
123:53 - want to make sure that mutation is
123:56 - really happening so let me
123:59 - least console.log test I just want to
124:10 - see I'll call it I just want to see that
124:13 - this is happening in the code somewhere
124:14 - and I'm gonna go back to sketch dog s
124:17 - and just have like three birds because I
124:21 - don't want it to go crazy so as soon as
124:24 - the three are done I should see mutate
124:25 - mutate yeah so I got a bunch of mutation
124:28 - so that's good so that is being called
124:29 - so hopefully the weights are being
124:31 - changed but you know what might work
124:33 - better I think I have a sneaking
124:35 - suspicion is that it might actually help
124:39 - me to rather than when I mutate pick an
124:42 - entirely new weight so you know what's
124:46 - going on here the internals of the
124:49 - neural network are something that I
124:50 - haven't talked about in this series
124:51 - that's really something reserved for my
124:53 - other videos about how neural networks
124:55 - work the only thing that's relevant in
124:57 - this series is the inputs of the game
124:59 - come in the outputs come out and the
125:01 - output tells me whether I should jump or
125:03 - not but what's actually stored inside
125:08 - the neural network or a bunch of numbers
125:10 - between negative 1 and 1 for all of
125:12 - these connections and so mutation means
125:15 - just pluck one of them out and give it a
125:16 - new value but if it's one that's doing
125:19 - sir pretty well I just were to like
125:21 - tweak the value a little bit instead of
125:23 - just giving it a whole new value and
125:25 - also what if I were to just tweak it a
125:28 - tiny bit so use one way I could do that
125:31 - is use a Gaussian distribution of random
125:32 - numbers random numbers that cluster
125:34 - around like a mean of zero but are often
125:37 - like so just like I want to give each a
125:39 - little bit of a nudge so let me come
125:42 - back over here and I'm gonna have to
125:44 - build in Gaussian random number
125:46 - generation into the library the neural
125:48 - network library but right now since I
125:49 - have p5 involved just to fix that I'm
125:52 - gonna comment this out and I'm gonna say
125:54 - return valve so this would be just like
125:58 - me adjusting the value a little bit
126:00 - right return the actual value changed by
126:03 - a little random amount but I think I'm
126:06 - gonna because when I did this for my
126:08 - class last year actually I
126:11 - remember using random Gaussian which is
126:13 - this is now a p5 function from the p5
126:15 - library this doesn't exist in JavaScript
126:17 - so got to implement that into my library
126:18 - but it'll work for now the mean would be
126:21 - 0 and the standard deviation would be
126:23 - like point 1 let's try that so let's see
126:26 - how this goes oh and let me I took out
126:29 - the console.log and let's give this a
126:32 - whirl now all right so I'm gonna speed
126:35 - this up and I'm also oh wait there's
126:38 - only like two of them so the other thing
126:41 - I need to do is let's get myself a nice
126:43 - population let's try 500 of these all
126:46 - right so there's 500 going I'm gonna
126:48 - speed this up and I'm gonna let this run
126:49 - for a little while and I will be back
126:52 - but at least we look at the chat
127:07 - [Music]
127:24 - okay let's see how we're doing here
127:32 - [Music]
127:54 - all right so it looks to me like we've
127:57 - done it there you know there's so much
128:00 - variation in here but I've evolved it
128:02 - for now 76 generations and what we see
128:05 - here is that we've got a bunch that are
128:09 - still alive and they're probably one in
128:10 - there that has pretty optimal weights
128:12 - and it's making it through now one thing
128:14 - that I would really like to do is it's
128:16 - kind of more fun to watch this if I show
128:19 - only the one that's kind of doing it bet
128:21 - doing best but at some point there will
128:23 - only be one left but I think we're
128:25 - pretty much there here's some things
128:27 - that you might want it that I would love
128:28 - to do with this in another part but I'm
128:30 - gonna leave them as exercises for the
128:32 - viewer come on over so a couple things
128:38 - one is that I can keep track of the
128:41 - single agent the single bird that has
128:43 - done the best overall time over all
128:45 - generations and I could save that in a
128:48 - variable like the best bird record bird
128:50 - and at anything and what I could do is
128:52 - actually I could download those weights
128:53 - I could save those weights to like a
128:55 - JSON file it's neural network
128:57 - configuration to a JSON file or even
129:00 - just save it in memory and I could
129:02 - always just click a button or something
129:03 - and say let me just see this one so
129:07 - that's something I would really love to
129:08 - add to this it's actually I might as
129:10 - well just show it to you because the
129:14 - example that I made for my course which
129:18 - is here is essentially exactly the same
129:21 - but there's a couple different things so
129:23 - one is I'm gonna so let me just ramp up
129:25 - this speed here so let me let this run
129:28 - for a little while the games may be a
129:30 - little bit different in this one and but
129:32 - so one of the things that I like about
129:33 - this is once I've let it run for a
129:35 - little while I can just click run best
129:38 - so far so now it and I could speed this
129:41 - up a little bit but I think I better
129:43 - train it more because I didn't get a
129:45 - really good one
129:46 - so so this is the idea of being able to
129:48 - just run the best one that's done you
129:50 - know that that has the best high score
129:51 - look at this okay so I'm gonna now I'm
129:53 - gonna do this so we can see this one
129:56 - that kind of has a pretty good sense of
129:59 - how to play the game kind of running
130:01 - just watch that one on its own
130:05 - it's very satisfying to watch like maize
130:07 - that it's doing it so that's one thing
130:09 - that would be worth as an exercise
130:11 - trying to add to this implementation
130:13 - that I made now once I even do that I
130:15 - could save it to a file so there's
130:18 - actually in the toy neural network
130:19 - library there's a like a save Jason I
130:21 - think function so I could save it to a
130:23 - file to reload later so if I'm training
130:25 - it all day or for an hour I could save
130:27 - it and bring it into another biome
130:28 - that's one thing another thing that I
130:31 - might want to do is I could probably
130:32 - optimize the fitness function quite a
130:33 - bit for example what if and this is a
130:36 - thank you to versatility for this this
130:40 - suggestion what if I actually scored not
130:42 - just how long it lasts but how well it
130:45 - maintains its look why location in
130:48 - between the top and bottom of those two
130:50 - pipes so that would be theirs but there
130:52 - you could probably think of many other
130:53 - ways that you could optimize this so
130:55 - saving it making the interface you know
130:58 - now we could also take this and we could
131:00 - go and add all the fun coding train
131:03 - design elements from the original from
131:04 - that flappy bird clone repository pull
131:07 - request now start the floodgates are
131:09 - open so we can make a version of this
131:11 - that maybe has even like a saved
131:14 - pre-trained flappy bird agent I'm gonna
131:18 - take I'm gonna pause for a second just
131:24 - look at the chat whoops
131:30 - because I have to take a break just hold
131:33 - on one second also
131:38 - Hey so just like five more minutes I'll
131:41 - come grab you guys okay okay sorry just
131:45 - don't worry this light this live stream
131:46 - has more some stuff is gonna happen but
131:48 - in about ten minutes
131:50 - so but let me see here okay
131:56 - for the fitness shouldn't you divide the
131:58 - bird score with the score of the best
132:00 - bird instead of dividing it by the sum
132:02 - of the scores no I want it to be I want
132:08 - no I don't want the highest Fitness to
132:10 - be one I want all the Fitness values to
132:13 - add up to one that's the way the
132:15 - probability map works use the Y velocity
132:22 - as input okay great so another
132:24 - suggestion that just came in from the
132:26 - chat is the actual Y velocity as an
132:29 - input as well because if I'm already
132:31 - moving up maybe I shouldn't jump verses
132:33 - by moving down so that's something you
132:34 - can add oh and here's another one
132:36 - what if actually instead of feet my own
132:42 - sort of manual feet whoops my own
132:47 - what if actually instead of my own
132:50 - manual feature extraction where I'm kind
132:53 - of evaluating the flappy bird scene to
132:56 - make inputs what if just the pixels what
132:59 - if it was just the pixels of the game
133:01 - itself that became the input but now we
133:04 - have a problem right we have a problem
133:06 - which is that I am looking at a scene
133:11 - let me just speed this up with come on
133:16 - let me just refresh right I am looking
133:19 - at a scene with many many many many
133:21 - birds playing all at once if I want to
133:24 - use the pixels of the game as input I
133:27 - cannot have the whole population there I
133:30 - need to have just the one current bird
133:33 - that is playing so I have to create a
133:35 - graphics context for every single member
133:38 - of the population and in fact this
133:40 - flappy bird game is so simple that
133:42 - actually as the player plays the game it
133:45 - doesn't affect how the game plays out
133:47 - imagine if I were doing my Astro
133:49 - it's coding challenge I can't have them
133:51 - all play in the same world because if
133:53 - one shoots an asteroid the other one
133:55 - hasn't shot that asteroid the game is
133:57 - changing for all of them so another
133:59 - thought experiment it could be how could
134:02 - I actually make this work where I see
134:04 - instead of all of them playing within
134:06 - one canvas a grid of the whole
134:10 - population lots of little little little
134:12 - versions of the game all playing
134:13 - together you know to be honest to make
134:15 - this work I don't have to see anything
134:16 - at all but try doing this with another
134:18 - game can you find my snake challenge my
134:21 - asteroids challenge my Frogger challenge
134:24 - any of those now could be trained a bot
134:28 - could be trained to play that game using
134:30 - the exact same technique so I'm just
134:37 - looking at the chat when I'm inside the
134:43 - pipe I chose the next pipe yeah that's
134:46 - true and people are telling me quickly
134:51 - add that y equals height kills the bird
134:54 - no so I'm not gonna add hold these
134:56 - things they need to be killed when
134:57 - hitting the ground I didn't know that
134:58 - that's part of flappy bird
135:02 - all right from the chat I also just
135:04 - learned that I have a couple mistakes
135:06 - one is that supposedly I guess in their
135:09 - game flappy bird if you go to the bottom
135:11 - you die so I don't have that implemented
135:13 - be introduced to see if it could solve
135:15 - itself with that also the way that I'm
135:17 - finding the closest pipe it's no longer
135:20 - the closest pipe right as it gets right
135:22 - up to it and so I really should not
135:24 - consider to be the closest pipe until
135:26 - it's gone all the way past but there's
135:27 - lots of little tweaks and minor things
135:30 - so I would gladly encourage you to
135:32 - create your own versions of this and
135:34 - submit them as community contributions
135:36 - and I'll look at them and maybe do
135:38 - another live stream next week or
135:40 - whenever I do the next live stream going
135:42 - through and showing some of these
135:43 - community contributions all right so
135:46 - thank you very much for watching this
135:49 - three-part to fuel coding challenge if
135:51 - it was really in three parts IP 23 I
135:53 - look forward to doing more
135:56 - our coding challenges hopefully maybe
135:59 - around a more neural evolution coding
136:01 - challenges because it's kind of one of
136:02 - my favorite topics okay thanks for
136:04 - watching and I'll see you in a future
136:05 - video all right so shadowplay asked Dan
136:12 - shouldn't the pipes have the same
136:13 - position every time you die
136:14 - no I precisely don't want them to I want
136:17 - to train an agent to be able to play any
136:21 - course of pipes I don't like I wanted to
136:26 - be able to work with wherever the pipes
136:29 - may be I don't want it to learn just one
136:31 - specific sequence of pipes can you check
136:35 - if I can turn on live subtitles let me
136:37 - try so I'm in my live dashboard does
136:42 - anybody know where that is so I'm
136:47 - looking I can't believe there are a
136:48 - thousand people watching now this is
136:50 - nuts
136:50 - I have never had a thousand people
136:52 - watching are extreme options normal
136:58 - latency enable DVR monetization cards I
137:03 - don't see an option for live captions
137:07 - unfortunately interesting Carmen in the
137:15 - chat writes for someone who has no
137:17 - knowledge of coding this was actually
137:18 - super informative I started watching
137:20 - knowing nothing and now I kind of
137:21 - understand what's going on that's
137:23 - amazing to me so if you if you're
137:25 - watching this and don't have any
137:25 - knowledge in coding I might suggest
137:27 - going through my beginner p5 tutorials
137:30 - so it's a just almost four o'clock yeah
137:37 - I have I think once before I had a
137:39 - thousand people watching live usually
137:41 - it's between 500 and 600 people so let
137:44 - me just mention what I'm going to be
137:46 - doing next now that I've gotten through
137:47 - this is I'm gonna start using tensorflow
137:51 - j/s so one of the things that I want
137:54 - that I'm going to do next the next thing
137:55 - I'm going to do and I'm gonna be
137:56 - integrating tensorflow chasse into some
137:58 - examples for the ml 5 library ml 5
138:02 - github Chasse at github
138:03 - I owe so this is a library being
138:06 - developed at ITP which is built on top
138:08 - of tensor
138:09 - yes I'll come back and talk about what
138:11 - all these things are but if you recall
138:14 - the doodle classifier I made for example
138:16 - I want to remake that doodle classifier
138:18 - with a much larger data set and a common
138:21 - something called a convolutional neural
138:22 - network built on top of tends to float
138:24 - yes it'll be much III assume I'd hoped
138:27 - it would be much more accurate and
138:28 - robust that way all right so let's check
138:35 - back on our bird so I what I'm gonna do
138:38 - right now is it's funny my preview is
138:42 - stopped working but I assume people can
138:43 - still see me hello to Nigeria that is
138:46 - unbelievable to me that there's people
138:48 - all over the world watching read some
138:50 - random numbers alright so I'm not done
138:52 - for today I'm done with this project but
138:54 - this live stream is gonna continue for
138:56 - about an hour more I think what I'm
138:59 - gonna do I'm trying to decide whether it
139:02 - should I think what I'm gonna do is is
139:08 - it better for me to say I need like five
139:10 - minutes to get set up with some guests I
139:12 - should just say what the guests are why
139:14 - am I like I like said this like thing
139:16 - where I want it to be a surprise but
139:17 - there's like no reason for that so I
139:20 - have some guests who are coming at own
139:23 - and Guillermo who are going to talk
139:25 - about their work with p5.js in Spanish
139:28 - and they're actually going to show some
139:30 - new materials that they've been making
139:31 - to teach programming in Spanish and
139:34 - they're going to do a tutorial about
139:35 - p5.js in Spanish so that's what's going
139:39 - to happen but it's gonna take me some
139:40 - time to get that all set up so I'm
139:43 - trying to decide if I should stop the
139:45 - stream and just restart it or if I
139:54 - should just like go to a scene that like
140:00 - I could put this on you could be forced
140:05 - to watch this on
140:06 - [Music]
140:07 - I don't know if I want to torture people
140:09 - with that so I think I'm gonna just hit
140:12 - stop streaming to give me five minutes
140:14 - to redo the microphone setup and let
140:16 - them get in here and get a new laptop to
140:18 - be comfortable so I'm just gonna pause
140:19 - the livestream just mute sound don't
140:22 - stop people really don't want me so I'm
140:23 - gonna make sure it's okay with hold on
140:24 - I'm gonna mute my microphone
140:43 - I'm gonna I'm gonna microphones back
140:46 - again I'm gonna bring our own and
140:47 - Guillermo in here and I will introduce
140:50 - them in a moment
140:51 - so you're just gonna see people
140:53 - shuffling around I'm gonna but I'm gonna
140:54 - mute my microphone and put on this music
141:07 - [Music]
141:23 - [Music]
141:30 - [Music]
144:44 - Oh best thing okay hello everyone
145:01 - you
146:38 - hello ok I think we're back if anybody
146:42 - before I start introducing the guests if
146:46 - you're watching this if you could just
146:49 - let me know that the sound is ok so I'm
146:52 - actually I could listen here
146:54 - hello 1 2 3 what about to me yeah great
146:58 - ok ok so it might be this one sound I
147:01 - sound a little bit quiet so we turn this
147:04 - one up alright alright so oh my goodness
147:11 - I'm getting like a phone call here this
147:13 - is what a disaster okay so I'm gonna
147:16 - take my cloaking device laptop and I'm
147:22 - gonna move this over here because I'll
147:24 - come sit over here once you guys start
147:25 - I'm gonna watch the chat to see if there
147:27 - are questions and so okay so we have two
147:34 - guests
147:34 - we're I'm gonna I'm gonna switch the mic
147:37 - quickly to the sec the second guest come
147:41 - on over here Guillermo let's see if I
147:42 - this is Aaron and Guillermo I'll let
147:45 - both of you introduce yourself as well
147:47 - um they're here to tell you about work
147:49 - that they've been doing with the p5 jet
147:51 - with the processing foundation with a p5
147:54 - GS project so we're gonna do a short
147:56 - little walkthrough presentation about
147:58 - what the project that they've been
147:59 - working on and how do more about it and
148:03 - then after that we'll take like a minute
148:06 - or two break then they're also gonna do
148:07 - a tutorial as well for total beginners

148:13 - you speak Spanish you're in the right
148:15 - place okay so let me try to not too
148:19 - awkwardly hand you this mic so if you

150:16 - tell you tune - great news by the
150:19 - pricing foundation regarding p30s
150:21 - so Peter J is a JavaScript library right
150:24 - that allows you to do pretty premium on
150:26 - the web and sorry in today you see here
150:29 - this is the P 30s website it lives on
150:31 - p5.js org and now in this upper right
150:34 - corner you have a link you have a button
150:37 - that says yes and you can click on it

151:15 - have the disk agar section which means
151:17 - download where you can have a link to
151:19 - download the whole p5.js library as a
151:22 - JavaScript file and also the files buys
151:25 - in a separate way because here this
151:27 - complete version also contains an empty

151:58 - getting started so here you have a cool
152:00 - tutorial about how to start from scratch
152:02 - so it tells you how to use a file to
152:05 - download and then how to create an HTML
152:08 - file that loads a p5 library and then
152:11 - how to start programming in PFI with the
152:13 - setup and draw functions so this is a
152:15 - cool tutorial of how to do your first

153:05 - continuing the next section would be the

153:08 - website where you can check every
153:11 - function and every valuable and
153:13 - everybody who disobey level in the
153:15 - library you can read about it so for
153:18 - example if you go to alpha you have a
153:19 - working example that you can edit if you
153:22 - want you have a description of what the
153:25 - function is for you have a syntax
153:28 - section which tells you how to write the
153:30 - function you said and any parameter
153:32 - that's that's there you also have a
153:34 - description of what it is what type of
153:36 - variable it needs and all of this is now
153:38 - in Spanish and that's for every

160:33 - you have to new medium post when it's
160:36 - written in Spanish and when it's written
160:37 - in English
160:38 - allow the whole process for
160:41 - internationalization of the processing
160:43 - foundation educational materials we talk
160:45 - about the process of the website and the
160:46 - book and everybody was involved in this
160:48 - project
160:49 - yeah that's that's the announcement
160:55 - thanks so much
160:56 - it's an honor to be here and we're super
160:58 - excited about the future of this I'm
161:05 - just gonna speak and your mics will pick
161:07 - me up it's fine a little bit here so
161:12 - I'll see if there's any questions in the
161:15 - chat but what I thought what I would
161:20 - love for you guys to do is to maybe if
161:23 - you could just do a brief introduction
161:25 - where you say your names and where
161:27 - you're from involved with coding and the
161:29 - processing foundation just we have that
161:32 - also because I think so just to let
161:33 - people know we're doing this live to
161:34 - make this announcement but the same way
161:36 - that I often then I'm not
161:40 - all the time but we're gonna do it the
161:44 - same way that I sort of do a live stream
161:46 - and then publish edited videos later is
161:48 - we're gonna make this into an
161:49 - announcement video that will most likely
161:51 - be released through the processing
161:53 - foundation YouTube which if you don't
161:55 - already subscribe to you should just
161:58 - search processing foundation on YouTube
162:00 - you'll find it but when this video gets
162:02 - published I'll make a link in the
162:03 - video's description also I'll post it
162:05 - something posted in the chat that would
162:07 - be great so go subscribe to the
162:08 - processing foundation YouTube so I
162:10 - wanted to just get more of an
162:12 - introduction from you guys that we can
162:13 - put just that I think that'll be nice to
162:16 - have and then I think we're gonna stay
162:18 - live and have do a little brief
162:22 - introduction to coding in p5 but only in
162:25 - Spanish so that's going to be like
162:27 - similar to my introduction I've always
162:29 - been that's similar to my introduction
162:35 - to programming videos but there but in
162:38 - Spanish and that will figure out maybe
162:39 - I'd love to have it as like a video
162:41 - that's on the coda trend channel but
162:42 - that might make more sense also the
162:44 - processing funding to go to we'll figure
162:45 - that out there so that's what's
162:46 - happening so maybe I'm gonna I'm gonna
162:48 - step aside and look at the chat a little
162:50 - bit to see if there are any questions
162:52 - and then if you guys can just do a
162:55 - little more introduction about yourself
162:56 - and I have that and you can put that go
162:58 - back to just have a like p5.js website
163:00 - Spanish one perfect people in the Chad
163:07 - who are confused or what's going on I
163:08 - finished all my tutorials for today the
163:11 - VIP versions of the splash stream will
163:13 - be archived and available later and the
163:15 - edited versions will come out next week
163:16 - but we're gonna be here for like another
163:18 - half hour or so to do a bit more
163:20 - tutorial stuff in Spanish so especially
163:23 - if you're a Spanish speaker
163:24 - come join tweet to your friends to come
163:26 - join if you want to listen anyway and
163:29 - just kind of see what we're doing that's
163:31 - great too and of course you could any
163:32 - language you want on the chat is

166:24 - computation yay
166:25 - Bertie Daniel where Sarah to a TV anyway
166:35 - should come in from the chat which I'll
166:37 - ask this is from Red Hen dev I have a
166:41 - Spanish student in my coding Club is
166:43 - there a particular coding concept term
166:45 - in English that is especially difficult
166:46 - or strange so I guess you know to
166:49 - generalize that question have been more
166:50 - like you know well how do you deal with
166:53 - variable names from as you're
166:56 - translating examples and things like
166:57 - that are there particular considerations
167:00 - that you have to make when you're
167:03 - porting and translate things to Spanish
167:06 - yeah answer I think that sometimes
167:09 - there's the same word like library
167:12 - there's sometimes two different
167:13 - translation and it's always a challenge
167:15 - to be consistent when we're talking so
167:17 - sometimes you would use one or the other
167:19 - and the people would confuse that is
167:21 - directly different things but at the
167:22 - same time so for example a library is a
167:25 - constant economy like day the correct
167:27 - our nation would be biblioteca which
167:28 - which is here but library also it's
167:31 - super similar to where Spanish that's
167:33 - called leave the area that's why people
167:35 - usually translated to so and they
167:37 - coexist like there's half and half of
167:38 - material translated both ways and people
167:41 - think they're different things for them
167:42 - oh yeah yeah I think in in the approach
167:46 - of teaching
167:47 - logic like programming logic there's no
167:51 - problem because it's the same
167:52 - mathematical logic and I think there's
167:55 - no problem in to use English words just
167:59 - to explain concepts like if this is a
168:02 - conditional but
168:03 - in Spanish there is other word which is
168:06 - si but I think it doesn't matter because
168:08 - you can use the English name for this
168:11 - tractor so it's okay and in the
168:16 - Declaration of variables or functions I
168:18 - think it's okay to it's the same idea
168:20 - they're similar it's like function is
168:22 - function yeah but yeah that's easy to
168:25 - remember that sometimes things are more
168:27 - obscure like int like int like doesn't
168:29 - make sense in Spanish that well for I
168:32 - think the biggest challenge is that
168:34 - there's no that much material like if
168:35 - you look up in Stack Overflow or in
168:37 - Google and you look for examples in
168:39 - Spanish it's not that much that's we're
168:40 - excited that now all these examples on
168:42 - the website and the book are in Spanish
168:43 - so there's a lot of materials to start
168:45 - with what we're gonna do now is
168:54 - transition to doing the Spanish language
168:58 - tutorial if I'm right this will be a
169:01 - total beginner tutorial so I know a lot
169:03 - of people are probably currently
169:04 - watching if you already know programming
169:06 - maybe you don't speak Spanish so you're
169:07 - welcome to stay we encourage you to stay
169:09 - and watch and give us feedback but the
169:11 - idea here is to take the content that
169:13 - we're going to show you might as well do
169:14 - a live since we're here live I know I
169:17 - did just tweet it out so hopefully a
169:18 - bunch of people have joined might be new
169:19 - to programming or Spanish speakers who
169:21 - are joining and watching now welcome
169:23 - hola and that then this will get re
169:30 - edited and published separately as an
169:32 - introduction to be fine Jess in Spanish
169:34 - for the practice website or wherever we
169:36 - end up figuring out to put it so that
169:37 - I'll let you guys figure out what you
169:40 - want to do so you can just you can it's
169:42 - a sort of silly thing that I do wanna do
169:43 - video stuff it's like I this whole thing
169:46 - is happening live but then I think to
169:48 - myself okay now this new thing is
169:49 - beginning start it that way alright okay
169:51 - great
169:52 - so when I'm in Spanish in three two one
169:56 - go
170:00 - hola um
170:12 - sorry ok this is very normal all this
170:14 - like live production stuff that I
170:16 - normally would not be live-streamed so
170:19 - if we do new screen recording because
170:21 - this is also just a good backup to have
170:23 - I think now so just because one of the
170:29 - things you'll notice is where you're
170:30 - standing is often one might be the
170:31 - friend of something you're showing up
170:32 - which is fine and that way when we edit
170:35 - this later
170:35 - that can get it'll get beta but if you
170:40 - keep kind of over here
170:46 - I mean maybe more room than that so but
170:49 - yeah if you three two one Spanish hola
