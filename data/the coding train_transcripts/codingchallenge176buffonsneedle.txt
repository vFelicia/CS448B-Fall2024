00:00 - [TRAIN WHISTLE]
00:00 - Happy Pi Day 2023, everybody.
00:03 - Oh, I'm excited for what
I'm going to do today.
00:05 - I thought I would just combine
two things that I love.
00:08 - One is delicious wonderful
pie and toothpicks.
00:12 - Now you might be asking,
you love toothpicks?
00:13 - That's a little weird.
00:14 - Well, I do have a coding
challenge all about toothpicks.
00:17 - And I thought there's
no chance I'm ever going
00:19 - to get to use toothpicks again.
00:20 - But today is the day.
00:21 - I am going to
approximate the number pi
00:24 - by dropping a box of
toothpicks onto the floor.
00:28 - How could that
possibly even work?
00:31 - This problem is known
as Buffon's needle named
00:35 - for Georges-Louis Leclerc.
00:37 - Comte de Buffon.
00:38 - It's a very famous
geometric probability
00:40 - problem from the 18th century.
00:42 - And it goes like this.
00:43 - Let's say you have a
desktop, floor, whatever--
00:46 - some horizontal surface.
00:48 - And it's made of wood, strips
of wood with a given width.
00:51 - All of the strips
are the same width.
00:54 - Now you have a
box of toothpicks.
00:55 - Those toothpicks are
shorter than the width
00:58 - of those strips of wood.
00:59 - And you take that box, and
you dump it out on the table.
01:03 - What is the probability
that any given toothpick
01:07 - will land and cross the border
between those strips of wood?
01:11 - Well, guess what?
01:13 - This is another case where
magically the number pi
01:17 - shows up.
01:18 - That probability is
linked to the number pi.
01:20 - I'm going to simulate this
idea of toothpicks as lines
01:23 - and see if we can
approximate the number of pi
01:26 - in a p5.js sketch celebrating
the wonderful day that
01:29 - is Pi Day
01:30 - (SINGING) It's Pi Day, Pi Day.
01:32 - Delicious and sweet, It's the
only number that you can eat.
01:36 - It's Pi Day, Pi Day.
01:40 - Before I write the code, let's
unpack the scenario a bit more
01:44 - and take a look at the math and
where the number pi shows up.
01:49 - Imagine this whiteboard
is the surface
01:52 - upon which I am going to dump
a whole box of toothpicks on.
01:55 - And the important
variable here is
01:57 - what is the distance between
these parallel, vertical lines.
02:01 - Let's call that variable t.
02:03 - Now I'm using t because that's
the naming convention that's
02:07 - on the Wikipedia page that
defines the Buffon's problem.
02:11 - I don't know if I'm
pronouncing it correctly,
02:12 - but I'm just going
to say Buffon.
02:15 - The next thing we need
is to discuss, well, what
02:18 - is the length of the toothpick?
02:20 - And I'm going to
call that variable l.
02:22 - Let's start with the length
of any given toothpick
02:25 - to be half of t.
02:28 - And let's make a gross
oversimplification
02:30 - of the scenario
just for a moment
02:32 - and say that there's some
magical force at play that only
02:35 - allows the toothpicks
to fall perfectly
02:37 - perpendicular to
these vertical lines.
02:39 - So maybe a toothpick falls here,
one falls here, one falls here,
02:44 - one falls here, et cetera
all perfectly horizontal.
02:49 - The important number
that I need to evaluate
02:51 - to determine if this particular
toothpick is crossing one
02:56 - of these boundaries
is the distance
02:58 - between the center
of the toothpick
03:00 - and whichever vertical line
happens to be closest to.
03:03 - So it's not this one.
03:05 - It's much further from this
one than it is to this one.
03:09 - And we'll call that distance x.
03:12 - If x is less than half the
length of this toothpick,
03:17 - if x is less than
l divided by 2,
03:20 - then it is crossing one
of these boundaries.
03:22 - How often will x be less
than half the length of l?
03:27 - Well, because l is
half the length of t,
03:29 - it's actually going
to be 50% of the time.
03:32 - Think about that.
03:33 - If x is anywhere a
quarter of the way across,
03:36 - then the toothpick is
covering the boundary.
03:39 - If it's anywhere in between
here all the way to 3/4,
03:42 - it's not crossing the boundary.
03:44 - Anywhere here, it is
crossing the boundary.
03:46 - So that's 50% of the values
in between the two borders it
03:51 - won't cross and 50% it would.
03:53 - Let's say l just happens to
be the actual length of t.
03:58 - Well, then, it's always going
to be crossing the boundary.
04:00 - There's nowhere for
me to fit it where
04:02 - it's not touching one
of the boundaries,
04:04 - so that would be 100%.
04:06 - So we can see here that
there's a relationship
04:08 - between the length of the
toothpick and the probability
04:12 - that it will cross
one of these borders
04:14 - in the case of when
the toothpicks are all
04:16 - falling perfectly horizontally.
04:18 - Now, of course,
this is not actually
04:20 - how the toothpicks will fall.
04:21 - They'll fall askew at an angle.
04:25 - Maybe one falls like this.
04:27 - Maybe one falls like
this, like this.
04:30 - Now, we have a new
variable at play--
04:33 - This particular angle.
04:35 - This is known as
the acute angle.
04:39 - I know it's cute, but that's
not why it's called acute.
04:41 - An acute angle is
the angle that's
04:43 - between 0 and 90 degrees
or pi divided by 2.
04:47 - So looking at this case,
let's think for a moment.
04:50 - That's about 45 degrees.
04:52 - I'm sure I didn't
draw it perfectly.
04:53 - But let's just now also say
how's another simplification?
04:57 - Let's say the magical force
now drops all the toothpicks
05:00 - at perfectly 45 degrees.
05:05 - So this is my toothpick,
and this is the border.
05:08 - Remember, the
distance I care about
05:11 - is the distance between the
center of the toothpick, which
05:15 - is eyeballing it
maybe about here,
05:17 - and the closest
border, which is here.
05:20 - That's x.
05:21 - But right now, I want to
calculate something different.
05:24 - I want to calculate
this distance.
05:28 - This angle here is theta.
05:31 - What is this length here?
05:34 - Remember, the length of
the entire toothpick is l.
05:37 - So the length of this hypotenuse
of this right triangle right
05:43 - here is l divided by 2.
05:46 - Remember a nice wonderful
trigonometry function
05:50 - called sine of an angle
which equals the opposite
05:55 - over the hypotenuse?
05:57 - Well, this is the opposite,
and this is the hypotenuse.
06:02 - Opposite equals l divided
by 2 times sine of theta.
06:08 - So if this distance x--
06:11 - let me get another
color marker here.
06:15 - This is x here.
06:16 - If x is less than l divided
by 2 times sine of theta, then
06:25 - the toothpick--
06:27 - this whole toothpick--
is crossing a border.
06:30 - And if I were to take this idea
essentially and consider it
06:33 - like I was doing here,
now I can say, well,
06:36 - if all of the toothpicks are
at a 45 degree angle, that's
06:40 - essentially the equivalent
of the length of all
06:43 - the toothpicks being
their actual length times
06:46 - sine of 45 degrees.
06:48 - So if all of the toothpicks were
really to fall at 45 degrees,
06:52 - then I could say
that the probability,
06:55 - if the length of
any given toothpick
06:57 - is half of the width of
each of these columns,
07:01 - then the probability is 50%
times sine of 45 degrees.
07:04 - Essentially, the
probability is the ratio
07:07 - of the length of the
toothpick to this width times
07:13 - sine of theta.
07:16 - But the toothpicks
don't actually
07:18 - fall at all the same angle.
07:20 - So we need to apply the idea of
a uniform probability density
07:24 - function.
07:26 - There is an equal
chance that an angle
07:29 - will fall at 0
degrees to 90 degrees
07:32 - to every angle in between.
07:33 - Theta will always be
somewhere between 0 and pi
07:37 - divided by 2. x, that
distance between the center
07:41 - of the toothpick and the
nearest parallel line,
07:43 - that will always be somewhere
between 0 and t divided by 2.
07:51 - So how do we calculate
the probability
07:55 - for any toothpick
that falls inside
07:58 - of this range of x uniform
chance of all possibilities
08:01 - and inside of this
range of theta uniform
08:04 - chance of all possible angles?
08:07 - What would be
useful to do is look
08:09 - at a graph where one axis
relates to x and another axis
08:16 - relates to theta.
08:19 - I know this is kind
of counterintuitive,
08:21 - but let's have the y-axis be x.
08:23 - And let's just assume
right now that t is 1.
08:27 - It's going to make
things much simpler.
08:29 - So we have a range
between 0 and 1/2.
08:33 - This is that distance
to the border.
08:38 - Let's consider the
x-axis to be the angle.
08:42 - And we have a range between
0 and pi divided by 2.
08:47 - And I'm just going
to put pi over here,
08:49 - and maybe I'll get to y.
08:50 - I'm adding that along
the x-axis as well.
08:52 - So what exactly, again,
am I graphing here?
08:56 - Let's stop for a second.
08:57 - Remember, I have a space
with parallel lines.
09:02 - And I've defined the distance
between those lines as t,
09:05 - and that's equal to 1.
09:07 - t is equal to 1.
09:09 - Now I also have a
toothpick with length l.
09:13 - And I want to assume my
toothpick is also of length 1.
09:17 - With t equal to 1 and the
length of the toothpick
09:19 - equal to 1 and this toothpick
always touching the border,
09:24 - so if the angle were
pi divided by 2,
09:27 - this would be the
toothpick, what
09:30 - is the distance from x, the
middle of it, to the border?
09:33 - It is 1/2.
09:35 - So I can plot that with
an angle of pi over 2.
09:38 - The distance is 1/2.
09:41 - Now let's look at the case
where the angle is 45 degrees
09:44 - or about pi divided by 4.
09:46 - I'm not going to
draw this perfectly,
09:48 - but I'm going to try.
09:50 - This is now the
angle 45 degrees.
09:53 - This is x.
09:54 - What is that distance?
09:56 - Well, if this is 1/2,
then it is 1/2 times sine
10:01 - of theta, which is going to be--
10:04 - I don't know--
maybe like 0.35-ish.
10:07 - So the generic formula
here for this value
10:10 - is equal to 1/2
times sine of theta.
10:14 - And if I were to plot that, I
get this nice circle extending
10:20 - it all the way out to pi.
10:21 - Now remember, the
toothpick isn't
10:23 - going to always fall with it
precisely touching the border,
10:27 - but that's what this
curve represents.
10:30 - Anywhere where that
distance is below the curve,
10:35 - it's crossing a boundary.
10:36 - Anywhere where that
distance is above the curve,
10:40 - it's not crossing the boundary.
10:41 - So this is really the
same scenario in some ways
10:45 - as a coding challenge I did
when I was throwing darts
10:48 - at a circle, and the ratio
of the number of times
10:51 - the dart would land outside
the circle to inside the circle
10:54 - was a way to approximate pi.
10:56 - We've got the same thing here.
10:58 - The ratio of how many times
the toothpick lands and crosses
11:02 - the border versus
doesn't cross the border
11:04 - can help us approximate pi.
11:06 - So how do I calculate the area
here underneath this curve?
11:11 - Well, I need to use calculus.
11:13 - The area under a curve is known
as the integral of that curve.
11:18 - And I should also point out that
this isn't actually a circle.
11:21 - 1/2 is a much smaller
distance than pi over 2.
11:26 - I really should have
drawn it like this.
11:28 - So it really should look
much more like this.
11:31 - And basically, this is half
of this kind of ellipse.
11:34 - Actually, now it's
getting to be a mess.
11:36 - Let me erase this really quick.
11:38 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
11:46 - Not my finest work, but
this is a better version
11:49 - of that graph drawn to scale.
11:51 - And you can see that the
area of this total rectangle
11:54 - is pi times 1/2,
or pi divided by 2.
11:59 - And if we were to do the
integration, the calculus,
12:02 - we would discover that the
area of this half of this kind
12:05 - of ellipse here is actually 1.
12:07 - So the ratio of the area under
the curve to the full rectangle
12:11 - is 1 divided by pi
over 2, or 2 over pi,
12:17 - meaning, if we could take a box
of toothpicks all of length 1,
12:22 - drop them onto a surface where
the columns were spaced out
12:26 - by one, count up
how many toothpicks
12:28 - crossed a border
versus didn't, we
12:31 - can solve for the value of pi.
12:33 - I don't want to admit how
many times I drew that graph.
12:36 - Here's a version of the
graph that's actually
12:38 - drawn precisely, and I'll
include the code for that graph
12:40 - as well.
12:41 - Additionally, if you want to
do a deeper dive in the math,
12:43 - let me suggest three resources.
12:45 - There's a wonderful
description of this problem
12:48 - from the College of Education
at the University of Illinois.
12:50 - Includes the same
graph and a discussion
12:52 - of the area
underneath the curve.
12:54 - There's, of course,
the Wikipedia page
12:56 - for Buffon's needle
problem, which actually
12:58 - shows the integration formula.
13:01 - And you can see there that
that's a more general purpose
13:03 - version of the formula for any
value of l and any value of t.
13:07 - You can also find
this wonderful post
13:09 - on Thomas Ogden's website
that describes the problem
13:12 - and includes many different
links to other resources
13:14 - as well.
13:16 - I don't know if I thought
I'd ever get here,
13:18 - but I can start working
on the code part, which
13:20 - I think will be
the part that I'll
13:22 - be a bit more comfortable with.
13:23 - That was a struggle for me
to try to explain that math.
13:25 - And thank you for tolerating it.
13:27 - So let's consider a
p5 canvas, 400 by 400.
13:31 - We need some variables.
13:32 - For example, what if
t is equal to 100?
13:35 - That'll make things
kind of easy.
13:37 - Maybe I should go
for 50 right now.
13:39 - And then let's have the length
of-- and I'm going to call that
13:42 - len for the toothpick--
13:45 - equal to 25, half of that width.
13:49 - So in the draw loop, first step
is to draw the vertical lines.
13:55 - There we go.
13:56 - Looking good.
13:57 - And then I need to randomly
drop a toothpick every frame.
14:01 - So what am I picking?
14:03 - If I'm dropping
a toothpick, it's
14:05 - going to land with its
center somewhere between 0
14:08 - and the width of the canvas
and a random angle between 0
14:12 - and pi divided by 2.
14:13 - But visually, I want this
to look more interesting,
14:15 - so I could actually have it
any angle between 0 and 2pi.
14:20 - So that's a random angle,
and that's a random position.
14:24 - Now let me just draw the line.
14:26 - Oh, and I'm going
to need a random y.
14:28 - The y does it matter.
14:29 - But to make it look interesting,
I'll pick a random y.
14:34 - How am I drawing the line?
14:36 - So the line will
be a horizontal--
14:38 - I'm going to rotate
by the angle.
14:40 - And then I need to draw the
line with x at the center.
14:44 - So x minus length divided
by 2, 0 x plus length
14:52 - divided by 2, 0.
14:55 - There's all my toothpicks.
14:57 - So clearly, let's draw just
the background and the lines
15:01 - once in setup.
15:03 - And now we're drawing
all these toothpicks.
15:05 - Great.
15:06 - We're really cooking here.
15:07 - We're going to be done so soon.
15:09 - Why are there so many toothpicks
over on the left-hand side?
15:11 - I must done something wrong.
15:12 - Oh, look at this.
15:13 - I forgot my pop.
15:15 - This looks better now.
15:17 - Oh, look at me.
15:18 - No, no.
15:19 - No x there.
15:21 - All that math really
broke my brain.
15:23 - I'm translating to the x,
y position of the line,
15:26 - so the line is then drawn
from negative length divided
15:30 - by 2 to positive length
divided by 2 along the x-axis,
15:33 - y being 0, and then
rotated by an angle.
15:37 - Now we've got all
of our toothpicks.
15:39 - So I need to figure out is
the toothpick intersecting
15:42 - one of those lines.
15:44 - Let's also change the
stroke weight here to 1
15:47 - so that it's a little
easier to see the lines
15:50 - underneath the toothpicks.
15:55 - There's a lot of
toothpicks there
15:57 - because I've been sitting here
for the last 5 or 10 minutes
15:59 - trying to think about, wait.
16:01 - Is there a way I could
do this without--
16:03 - I don't know-- using the
built-in variable 2pi
16:06 - in my code?
16:07 - I mean, after all, I'm
trying to create a simulation
16:10 - to approximate the value of pi
in a scenario where I wouldn't
16:13 - know the value of pi.
16:15 - So if pi is in my
code, haven't I just--
16:18 - this is terrible.
16:19 - I think you and I together
right now just need
16:22 - to admit that, yes,
the core idea here
16:24 - is doing this in real life
with actual toothpicks.
16:27 - And there, you would never
be using the value of pi
16:31 - in your physical manifestation
of dropping the toothpicks.
16:33 - But in terms of being
able to draw the stuff
16:35 - to just simulate it, the
point is for the viewer
16:38 - to see what's happening.
16:39 - And if I'm using pi underneath
the hood, I think that's OK.
16:43 - Are we OK with that?
16:44 - I'm OK with that.
16:45 - I hope you're OK with that.
16:46 - So now I just need
to write a function
16:49 - to determine if the toothpick
has crossed one of the lines.
16:53 - So if I know the x, y, the
middle of the toothpick,
16:56 - I need to find what
column is closest.
16:59 - So I can actually take that
x, y position and divide
17:02 - by the width of the column
and round up or down.
17:06 - So x divided by t,
and then round that.
17:12 - Then the distance
is the difference
17:15 - between that closest
column location and x
17:17 - or the absolute value thereof.
17:20 - Now if that distance is
less than 1/2 the length
17:24 - of the toothpick times
sign of the angle,
17:26 - it's crossing one
of the columns.
17:31 - Let's draw it as green if it is
intersecting one of the lines.
17:37 - What's wrong here?
17:40 - Oh.
17:41 - So I found the closest
column is the index
17:44 - of the column not the actual
x position of the column.
17:47 - I need to multiply that by t.
17:52 - Something is wrong.
17:54 - Oh, oh, oh.
17:56 - Oh, my goodness.
17:58 - What a mess I have done of this.
17:59 - First of all, I'm picking
any angle between 0 and 2pi.
18:02 - And then, I'm using
sine of that angle.
18:05 - But what's going on?
18:10 - This is my p5 canvas.
18:13 - This is the horizontal axis.
18:16 - I drew my line like this
between negative length divided
18:22 - by 2 to positive length
divided by 2 with this
18:25 - being the center.
18:26 - If I'm going to
rotate it by an angle,
18:28 - I'm rotating it
relative to the x-axis,
18:30 - whereas, really,
I want to rotate
18:32 - it relative to the y-axis.
18:34 - I also want the acute
angle, not any angle
18:38 - that it happens to be.
18:40 - So I need to account
for that in my code.
18:42 - So the first thing I
can do is draw the line
18:45 - as a vertical line.
18:46 - That will help me quite a bit.
18:48 - So you can see here, if you zoom
in, some of them are correct,
18:52 - and some of them are incorrect.
18:54 - So let's just, for
right now, only
18:57 - do any random angle
between 0 and pi over 2.
19:03 - So this is correct now.
19:05 - But I only have a very
small range of angles.
19:09 - So visually, it just
doesn't look right.
19:11 - it looks a little wonky.
19:12 - I think it's going
to be fine if I
19:15 - pick any angle between negative
pi over 2 to positive pi over 2
19:20 - is actually all the possible
lines you could draw.
19:23 - I don't need to go the full
360 because it mirrors itself.
19:27 - That looks right now.
19:28 - I could also do between
0 and pi probably.
19:32 - I think it still looks correct,
although, visually, this
19:35 - is a very poor way
that I'm drawing it.
19:36 - Let's see if we can come up with
something better to highlight
19:40 - the lines that intersect
versus the ones that don't.
19:43 - Let me try switching
to a darker background
19:46 - and use a brighter color
for the intersections.
19:50 - And let me make
the lines thinner.
19:54 - And now maybe I'll make the
whole thing much bigger.
19:59 - And let's do like
10 lines per frame.
20:07 - We're ready.
20:08 - Now what I need to do is
calculate an approximate value
20:13 - for pi.
20:14 - Let me get a little bit smaller.
20:16 - So I need to find the
ratio between the number
20:18 - of toothpicks that
are intersecting
20:20 - and then the total
number of toothpicks.
20:23 - So every single time
total goes up by 1
20:28 - and only when
they're intersecting,
20:29 - intersecting goes up by 1.
20:33 - Then the ratio equals
intersecting divided by total.
20:38 - And the probability is 2 divided
by pi times l divided by t.
20:46 - So the probability equals
2 divided by pi times l
20:51 - divided by t.
20:53 - So I want to solve for pi.
20:55 - So pi times the probability
equals 2l over t,
21:01 - or pi equals 2l divided by
the probability times t.
21:06 - And for me, I'm not
calculating the probability.
21:10 - I am inferring it from the
ratio of the number of ones that
21:14 - intersected versus didn't.
21:15 - So this is my ratio in the code.
21:20 - So my pi approximation,
which I'll name pi,
21:23 - is equal to 2 times the length
divided by the ratio times t.
21:32 - What error am I getting here?
21:33 - Oh, there's a reserve
function called ratio,
21:36 - so we'll call this probability
or prob for probability.
21:40 - So dare I look at
my pi approximation?
21:47 - Hey, that's not so terrible.
21:50 - That looks kind of like pi.
21:51 - I think I might have
done this correctly.
21:53 - Let's at least put
that onto the canvas.
21:57 - Well, actually, let
me make a DOM element
21:58 - because drawing it
out of the canvas
22:00 - might be a little bit wonky.
22:03 - Let's make the page
have a white background,
22:05 - so the text is more
visible by default.
22:07 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
22:16 - So now I have a div
that I made in p5 that's
22:19 - just showing the value 0.0.
22:23 - And now I'm putting in
the approximation of pi
22:25 - to five decimal places.
22:28 - Let's go back and just drop
one toothpick per frame.
22:32 - I enjoy watching
it slowly converge.
22:34 - 3.1415926535.
22:39 - I should also mention
that, even though I didn't
22:41 - take this approach, I
could have actually used
22:43 - the formula, the
algorithm for testing
22:44 - whether one line segment
intersects another line
22:46 - segment.
22:47 - And, in fact, I've done this
before in the 2D raycasting
22:50 - coding challenge.
22:51 - I don't remember
what number that was,
22:52 - but I'll put it up
here on the screen.
22:54 - So I'll make sure to include
a link to the time code
22:56 - in that video where I go
through that algorithm,
22:58 - as well as this other
p5 example, which
23:01 - looks at how I can actually test
whether two line segments are
23:04 - intersecting or not with
this particular algorithm.
23:06 - Well, I'm not getting the
best approximation here,
23:09 - but I I've really
enjoyed this project.
23:12 - I am curious to see
what it looks like if I
23:14 - have a much smaller length.
23:18 - What if I do 100
lines per frame?
23:20 - 897932384626433.
23:26 - This is kind of fun to see.
23:28 - And there you have
it-- approximating pi
23:30 - with Buffon's needle.
23:33 - Now I had a lot
of fun doing this.
23:34 - I found it quite challenging
to explain all the math.
23:36 - Let me know if you have
questions or something didn't
23:38 - make sense or certainly
if I got something wrong.
23:41 - I would love to hear from you.
23:42 - Are you inspired to make your
own version of this simulation?
23:46 - What could you add to
it, change the design,
23:48 - the color, the interactivity?
23:50 - Could you try some kind
of physics simulation
23:53 - of the toothpicks
bouncing around?
23:54 - Maybe you try different shapes.
23:56 - What's the probability if
it's squares or circles
23:58 - or other kinds of polygons
besides just simple lines?
24:01 - If you make your
own version of this,
24:03 - I would love to know about it.
24:05 - And guess what?
24:06 - We've got a whole
passenger showcase
24:08 - at the codingtrain.com
in the video description.
24:10 - I'll include a link
with instructions
24:11 - for how to submit your own.
24:13 - I would love to check it out.
24:14 - Thanks so much for
taking this time with me
24:16 - and celebrating Pi Day.
24:17 - I will see you next
year, 2024 Pi Day
24:20 - and maybe beforehand through
the internet or whatever.
24:23 - I'm going to stop now.
24:24 - Goodbye.
24:25 - [TRAIN WHISTLE]
24:26 - (SINGING) Pi Day.
24:26 - My favorite treat.
24:28 - Circumference divided
by diameter t.
24:30 - It's Pi Day, Pi Day.
24:35 - Actually, now it's
getting to be a mess.
24:37 - Let me erase this really quick.
24:39 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
25:00 - Not my finest work.
