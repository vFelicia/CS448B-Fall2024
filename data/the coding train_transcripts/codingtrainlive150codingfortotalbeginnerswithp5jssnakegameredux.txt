00:10 - [Music]
00:22 - [Music]
00:46 - you know never I can never I can never
00:50 - get it right I could never get it right
00:53 - here we are starting a new year and I
00:55 - really thought I had it this time Thank
00:58 - You Kelly who just sent me a message in
01:00 - the slack that popped up that I saw that
01:03 - I was muted okay so I'm welcome back
01:06 - happy Sun at the end of summer happy
01:08 - started school back to school happy
01:10 - almost a Labor Day weekend it is a
01:12 - holiday weekend a Friday afternoon here
01:14 - in the United States where I live in New
01:16 - York City I'm broadcasting live from the
01:18 - Tisch School of the Arts at New York
01:20 - University I have I haven't seen the
01:25 - chat catch up to me and I know that the
01:26 - chat the live chat that's going on
01:28 - during the during the stream is usually
01:29 - about 30 seconds behind so now I see
01:32 - that someone says Leo says now we good
01:34 - so I assume that means the sound is
01:36 - going um could you could hear the music
01:38 - I think when it was playing before yes
01:40 - so I have a whole lot of really
01:42 - wonderful happy things to announce I'm
01:45 - gonna talk about something called the
01:47 - p5.js web editor that is the primary
01:50 - topic today's live stream will be for
01:53 - the total beginner for the most part
01:55 - they'll be a few things that I'll do
01:56 - that aren't that are that involves
01:59 - things that I that you would have to
02:01 - know about already in terms of
02:03 - programming to be able to follow along
02:04 - in full detail but yeah that's always I
02:06 - try to have everything friendly and
02:08 - available to the beginner but today I am
02:11 - returning to my roots and going back to
02:13 - create the first intro - you're about to
02:17 - learn to code for the very first time
02:18 - videos I'm replacing some of the videos
02:21 - on my channel that have gone out out of
02:23 - date so if you're kind of here for the
02:26 - machine learning lower-level tensorflow
02:28 - programming stuff that i also sometimes
02:30 - do go enjoy dinner or breakfast or go
02:34 - back to sleep whatever it is you were
02:36 - doing
02:36 - I um I want to begin today unfortunately
02:41 - with some very sad news I'm gonna bring
02:44 - up the web browser here Medan it's only
02:49 - fitting that I I'm not sure if I
02:50 - pronounced his name correctly
02:52 - is a coding terrain viewer for a long
02:54 - time a member of the slack community
02:57 - someone who made countless contributions
03:01 - on the coding train github I was poring
03:04 - through all of these commits from Marin
03:07 - I was looking at some of the messages
03:10 - that Marin wrote Marin sadly passed away
03:14 - I believe this week I actually don't
03:16 - know the date I was alerted to this news
03:19 - on Twitter I wanted to take so the merit
03:24 - is not something I ever met a Marin I
03:26 - think though is you know one it is I
03:29 - don't have anything prepared to say but
03:31 - I think that what I want to say is that
03:33 - one of the reasons why I enjoy and love
03:35 - getting to do this is that the the
03:40 - material that I put out on this channel
03:42 - other people find it and they send me
03:45 - things back they teach me things they're
03:47 - kind to me and answering my questions
03:49 - they join the slack community they help
03:51 - somebody else they contribute on github
03:53 - you know I do earn a small living from
03:56 - this channel in addition to the work
03:58 - that I do at NYU but there's more to it
04:01 - also than that and Mayer and I think is
04:03 - someone who really for me even though I
04:06 - never met him or never spoke voice to
04:08 - him only chatted through github is
04:11 - somebody that I really came to know or
04:14 - feel that I know and I'm really really
04:17 - sad sort of crushed to hear this news so
04:20 - today's live stream is dead it to
04:22 - Meriden is dedicated to Marin I
04:25 - encourage you to check out the website
04:28 - Marin dhtml I believe there's a place
04:31 - where you can leave online condolences
04:33 - and most of the I'm Erin is from the
04:36 - Netherlands if I'm correct somebody
04:38 - correct me if I'm if I'm wrong so I
04:42 - think if you click on here you'll see
04:43 - most of it too in Dutch and I'm getting
04:50 - some notes that maybe my sounds a little
04:51 - off so I'll look at that for in a minute
04:55 - so in the future I might try to do a
04:57 - fundraiser around suicide awareness and
05:00 - that's something that I'm looking into a
05:02 - YouTube has a new platform called
05:03 - YouTube giving but this today's live
05:05 - stream back to the beginner I think is
05:07 - appropriate it's dedicated to Meryn I'm
05:09 - gonna mute my microphone and take just
05:14 - about 30 seconds of silence you know I'd
05:17 - ask you in the chat - yeah I know that
05:20 - everybody watching this is the stream
05:22 - comes in at a different time laughs 30
05:24 - seconds 20 seconds later 45 seconds so
05:26 - take a moment take 30 seconds to take a
05:29 - break from the chat and I will be back
06:20 - okay I also want to say that I'm wearing
06:22 - it's an awkward transition but I'm gonna
06:24 - go back into coding tutorials as I
06:26 - typically do on Fridays I also am
06:30 - wearing this shirt for the made by Tim
06:32 - choy as part of his project distributed
06:35 - web of care I was like oh actually just
06:37 - got that shirt I want to wear it on the
06:38 - coding train should I wear today it's a
06:40 - symbol of what I think to me to me I
06:43 - love what tan is doing with his project
06:44 - distributed web of care I have to look
06:46 - over here in my monitors see what's
06:47 - written on it but a lot of times when we
06:49 - think about technology we think about
06:51 - control user machine learn and what
06:55 - about thinking about care what about
06:57 - unlearned we're all after all rather
06:59 - uncomputable so this is a shirt from Tim
07:02 - choice project distributed web of care I
07:05 - I'll try to include some links to
07:07 - Damien's work in video description okay
07:11 - so there was there was some some a
07:20 - couple notes about maybe my shirt tag is
07:23 -  ok well that's that's pretty
07:25 - typical for me there were some notes
07:28 - thank you Chris Persian for posting the
07:33 - note in the slack channel about the
07:34 - National Suicide Prevention lifeline
07:36 - which is one eight hundred two seven
07:38 - three eight two five five that's
07:40 - obviously a United States number okay so
07:44 - and and thank you moderators for
07:48 - moderating the chat K week bond in
07:50 - particular and others of those who are
07:52 - moderating what everything ok with the
07:54 - sound before I move on I'm just going to
07:56 - have a little drink of water check the
07:58 - white board camera let's see here is it
08:01 - working it is not on of course when I
08:07 - drink that water you can really hear it
08:08 - right it's very like awkward and weird
08:10 - sounding probably coding train brought
08:13 - to you by water okay what first of all I
08:15 - have this chair is like in the shot
08:18 - which is a problem where can I put it
08:21 - I'll just put it here white board
08:24 - everything ok sound is fine over here I
08:28 - am back going to
08:31 - I will include links to Aaron's website
08:35 - and his commits and workout with
08:38 - according trained in the description I'm
08:40 - closing this whoops I have foes setting
08:43 - up some stuff oh and this is a forsen
08:45 - thing I'm going to talk about and this
08:49 - another thing I'll mention is that I
08:52 - have the other thing that sounds a
08:56 - little quiet sounds okay good you know I
08:59 - prefer it to be a little bit quiet to be
09:01 - honest I say won't you be able to hear
09:03 - it but I'll get a little bit excitable
09:05 - gonna get a little bit loud and when
09:09 - that happens sometimes the microphone
09:11 - can peek or distort and Matt Chea who
09:13 - does a lot of the video editing for
09:14 - posting stuff separately afterwards can
09:16 - always boost the volume it's easier to
09:18 - boost it then correct it down so if
09:20 - unless there's a significant problem
09:21 - with you being able to hear it yeah okay
09:25 - so I do have some new branding stuff
09:27 - that's coming along the way you can see
09:30 - here this there's gonna be some new
09:31 - t-shirts with this new bouncy letters
09:34 - coding Train logo I you'll notice that
09:39 - in the chat there I have new emojis and
09:43 - icons for the members that's a thing
09:45 - that's a part of the YouTube membership
09:47 - program you're interested I you know I
09:49 - want to believer that point but those of
09:51 - you who are members of the chat can go
09:52 - ahead and blast them with those emojis
09:54 - and so there's new there's a lot of new
09:56 - stuff coming with new characters and
09:58 - some new t-shirt stuff and stickers and
10:01 - things like that okay let's see all
10:07 - right so let's go here so this is what
10:12 - you know this is a bit of a tricky time
10:15 - of year for me as I mentioned many times
10:17 - already I work at New York University
10:20 - and so I have classes starting next week
10:21 - I'm teaching three classes which is a
10:23 - lot and one of them is on Tuesday from
10:26 - the meets on Wednesday at Monday's a
10:27 - holiday but in particular one of the
10:32 - classes that I'm teaching is the
10:34 - introduction to programming for total
10:36 - beginners and I see that there was a new
10:38 - member that joined alka I think is out
10:42 - got a new member of the
10:45 - joined Alka Thank You out guy first the
10:53 - camera goes off those good timings and
11:02 - so I need to buy my previous video about
11:07 - to around here I think well I'm just
11:08 - gonna start what I got to cover this lap
11:10 - if I haven't know a laptop so much to
11:11 - discuss I have new workflow I'm gonna do
11:13 - a video about the new workflow but I
11:15 - can't get to that today because what was
11:18 - I trying to get to here yes I need to go
11:20 - to youtube youtube.com slash the coding
11:25 - train and I need to go to oh I could
11:30 - subscribe to my channel I created a new
11:32 - Google account just to be logged into
11:34 - something here subscribe
11:36 - got another subscriber I'm gonna go to
11:40 - here there we go I'm gonna go let's just
11:43 - look here no no not here don't show me
11:46 - an ad don't show me an ad alright so in
11:51 - theory and a new member another new
11:55 - member question is are the lights
11:57 - flashing at home Meir Shah thank you for
12:00 - joining fire siya so these are these are
12:06 - the videos for the learn to code from
12:08 - scratch you've never coded before course
12:11 - and they are many of them were made I
12:15 - would say two or three years ago some of
12:20 - them were made last year a year ago if
12:23 - we start getting into the classes with
12:25 - es6 stuff that I started doing okay
12:29 - sorry there's something there's some
12:30 - like weird delay going on that's weird
12:34 - so like the output of this into my
12:38 - monitor is behind I don't think that's
12:40 - gonna cause a huge problem but let me
12:43 - just test something with you all just to
12:46 - see if because you is this out of sync
12:49 - for you I don't care so much but I'm
12:51 - curious it's a new computer I didn't
12:52 - notice this when I did my test run
12:54 - through you're gonna be able to hear me
12:56 - type because the tie
12:57 - is kind of loud and I want you to so
12:59 - when you hear the sound of the letter a
13:01 - does the letter a up here and I'm gonna
13:03 - look over here too so for me I see it
13:09 - immediately and then it appears on the
13:14 - monitor of what I'm live-streaming a
13:16 - little bit later
13:17 - yet when I move my hand it's instant so
13:20 - there seems to be a little bit of a
13:21 - delay but I think that's gonna be fine
13:26 - I mean we have to live with it right now
13:27 - if that's a major issue for anybody let
13:29 - me know okay
13:36 - thank you everybody all these nice
13:38 - messages in the chat I love seeing that
13:40 - okay so in theory this fall I intend to
13:47 - remake all of these videos that's crazy
13:51 - I don't think I'm gonna do that
13:53 - but I am at least going to make remake
13:57 - one point one introduction p5.js
14:00 - tutorial this workflow video is going to
14:02 - go away I mean it's not going to go away
14:03 - it's still gonna exist but that workflow
14:06 - video is not for a total beginner
14:07 - instead it'll be about the p5 web editor
14:10 - which I will talk about then I'll get to
14:12 - basics of drawing so I want to see if I
14:14 - can redo today this was a 12-minute
14:17 - video this was a 15 minute video and
14:18 - this was a 15 minute view and by the way
14:20 - when I say redo it's not like I just
14:21 - went rewatched photos so I'm just doing
14:23 - the same idea but I'll probably do it in
14:25 - a different way with different examples
14:27 - and just with my more gray hair so
14:30 - that's the so that's the no delay people
14:38 - are saying everything's fine or it's a
14:39 - tiny millisecond this is like okay so
14:41 - that's the core plan what else do I want
14:45 - to do oh no I want to announce the p5
14:48 - webinar I'm kind of doing that already
14:49 - but I will say a few more words about
14:51 - that I want to do the new intro to code
14:55 - a drawing tutorial a colored these are
14:57 - for complete and total beginners so if
14:59 - you've never coded before ever
15:02 - today is a live stream to tune into oh
15:05 - but of course as everything will be
15:07 - edited and recorded and uploaded later
15:08 - to
15:10 - then I have this idea the most I
15:13 - shouldn't say this now because what if I
15:15 - don't get to it what time is it now
15:19 - it's five o'clock I have a I have some
15:21 - time but I also run out of steam
15:22 - eventually the snake coding challenge is
15:25 - the most viewed video on my channel it's
15:28 - also like I use constructor functions
15:31 - instead of es6 classes i didn't have the
15:34 - p5 web editor when i made that i did
15:36 - some weird stuff in that video that
15:38 - makes no sense probably so I thought I
15:40 - would try today as a coding challenge
15:41 - snake game Redux it's kind of true that
15:45 - this is just a grab at words because
15:48 - like I'm sort of curious like why did
15:50 - that video catch fire and if I do it
15:52 - again they probably won't but will it
15:53 - I'm just sort of curious but it also
15:55 - feels like it's worth worth giving
15:57 - another crack at so if anybody wants to
16:00 - tell me that's a terrible idea I will
16:01 - listen but I probably do it anyway and
16:03 - then number six on this list we find a
16:07 - working marker I'm looking at the chat
16:15 - number six on this list is I want to
16:18 - make some videos about how to make a p5
16:25 - course with Google classroom so and this
16:33 - will relate to me announcing the p5 web
16:37 - editor so let me get to that I'm not I'm
16:39 - not announcing the p5 web better the p5
16:41 - web header has already been announced by
16:43 - the people who made the p5 web editor I
16:45 - am pointing you to that announcement
16:47 - just to be clear so I do work closely
16:50 - with the processing foundation I helped
16:53 - to found to create the processing
16:55 - foundation I've been working on
16:56 - processing since 2004 and if I go to
16:59 - medium.com slash at processing org you
17:08 - can see this recent post hello p5.js web
17:11 - editor so this is the p5.js
17:14 - it's just really distracting to me I'm
17:16 - sorry when I scroll and then it's like I
17:18 - see at the corner of my eye the
17:20 - scrolling coming later but I'm gonna get
17:21 - you
17:22 - this is the p5 web editor announcement I
17:25 - do need to deal with this laptop and
17:28 - putting some green in front of it I
17:30 - encourage you to watch this promo video
17:32 - it has I'm just gonna play it without
17:34 - sound because you will not hear it
17:37 - oops so gonna let it play so this is the
17:41 - announcement video it has all the people
17:44 - who work don't know people who worked on
17:46 - the project contributed it to it talk
17:48 - about it look there's me with like a
17:50 - longer beard and Orioles hat Orioles go
17:53 - Orioles right maybe
17:55 - Sabich on the reason why I'm one
17:58 - dimension Saba Khan has been working on
18:00 - education outreach for the processing
18:02 - foundation he has a whole video about
18:05 - how to do education with p5 and I think
18:08 - it more sort of an overview and I would
18:11 - like to do some nuts and bolts of like
18:13 - you're a high school teacher and you use
18:14 - Google suite already how can you
18:16 - integrate that with p5 and the web
18:18 - editor it's something that I'm doing
18:19 - this semester here's Cassie who is the
18:22 - creator of the p5 web editor so I
18:24 - encourage you to watch these videos on
18:25 - your own read about it
18:27 - there is a full overview video with
18:30 - Cassie of all of the features not well
18:33 - the bulk of almost all of the features
18:35 - of the web editor it's about a 20 minute
18:37 - video of Cassie walking you through
18:38 - everything I'm not gonna make one of
18:40 - those myself it exists right here from
18:42 - the creator of the web editor so I
18:43 - encourage you to watch that there is a
18:46 - video here from Mathura who is a recent
18:49 - ITP alum and researcher and a research
18:53 - resident who with many other people all
18:56 - credited in this video Claire Kearney
18:58 - bopi and Lewis and many other people
19:01 - have worked on making the p5 web editor
19:05 - accessible for people who are blind or
19:07 - have low vision right from the beginning
19:08 - so you can watch that video to learn
19:10 - about that and there's a great question
19:15 - in the chat from Cole which I want to
19:17 - answer in a second and then there's also
19:20 - this video about p5.js for educators
19:23 - Sabra talks about a lot of different
19:26 - initiatives related to computer science
19:28 - education in particularly in K through
19:30 - 12 and how how you can use p5.js if that
19:33 - interest you there's a lot of work going
19:35 - on with the New York City Department of
19:36 - Education and the cs4 all initiative
19:39 - they've been directing the writing of a
19:43 - new curriculum written by Luisa Pereira
19:45 - who is also teaches here ITP there's a
19:48 - whole p5 curriculum I will point you to
19:50 - that if you but you'll find it in the
19:51 - description so we this is today is a
19:54 - wonderful day if you are a teacher if
19:56 - you are a beginner I think that all of
19:59 - these resources have been launched in or
20:00 - out there okay so I encourage you to all
20:04 - these videos are on the processing
20:05 - foundation YouTube channel how do I get
20:08 - to that YouTube processing foundation so
20:11 - if you don't already subscribe to the
20:15 - processing foundation I look I'm gonna
20:17 - subscribe but I'm something like I don't
20:21 - know what Google account this is that I
20:22 - just made but so I encourage you to
20:24 - subscribe to the processing foundation's
20:26 - YouTube channel and if you have the
20:28 - means you can also support the
20:30 - processing foundation's work it's a
20:32 - non-for-profit charity here in the
20:34 - United States at processing foundation
20:36 - org slash support that's not the right
20:40 - URL slash
20:42 - support okay so all right so that is
20:47 - check announce P five web editor let me
20:50 - quickly answer a question that was asked
20:53 - about by Cole in the chat and okay I'm
20:58 - sorry I'm looking at the slack channel
20:59 - so Cole asked something like I'm gonna
21:02 - rephrase the question will the p5 web
21:05 - editor change the process of uploading
21:08 - coding challenges so I don't plan to
21:10 - exclusively use the p5 just web editor
21:13 - on this channel it will certainly become
21:15 - a core tool my mission is to show a
21:20 - variety of ways of coding you know again
21:23 - I do focus a bit on using processing in
21:25 - p5 and related libraries but I use node
21:28 - and I'm going to be using Visual Studio
21:29 - code I'm going to show you some tricks
21:32 - that I have to use a different terminal
21:33 - this I term thing that the slack Channel
21:36 - and people have helped me set up because
21:38 - I'm very out of date with my stuff so
21:42 - but if I do a coding challenge in the
21:45 - web editor it
21:46 - will facilitate people making their own
21:48 - versions of it and sharing those very
21:50 - easily and I will talk about that and
21:51 - show that as I get into the web editor
21:54 - itself alright I've got to get into this
21:59 - material so let me figure out let's get
22:07 - a good phone okay I got to figure this
22:09 - out now here's I really really hope I
22:12 - don't subtly like spend 45 minutes on
22:14 - this please keep me in check but the web
22:17 - editors layout is a little bit awkward
22:20 - compared to how I've usually done my
22:22 - videos so I'm going to just quickly try
22:25 - to set something up so first let me get
22:27 - a good font size those are you watching
22:30 - how is this font size and so let me know
22:37 - I kind of feel like it needs to be a
22:38 - little bit bigger let's go to 36 okay so
22:44 - let's do here and 400 400 shows up there
22:48 - one thing I can't do easily if i zoom
22:53 - that's fine it's okay that I can live
22:55 - with all right so p5 web editor now
22:59 - there's two options I'm gonna try
23:02 - something here this is write it okay
23:04 - first let's try to get this laptop to go
23:08 - away so I've got some green paper
23:11 - cloaking device and this is my extra
23:14 - laptop where I look at the slack channel
23:16 - for members it's it too big okay that's
23:22 - fine I you know I am always erring on
23:25 - the side of making it larger yes me I am
23:28 - sue me I saw the CSS modifications to
23:30 - flip the web editor and also increase
23:32 - the console oh I didn't now me I am so
23:34 - me can you put that in like a github
23:36 - gist because that'll be the easiest way
23:39 - for me to grab it onto this computer I
23:40 - played around with it but I didn't
23:42 - actually do it on the login so if you
23:44 - could put it like a github gist I'm a
23:49 - little bit afraid of doing that because
23:51 - I'm a little afraid if the web editor
23:54 - looks different on my screen compared to
23:59 - other peoples
24:00 - they're going to be confused but I think
24:06 - it just being flipped is sort of not a
24:08 - big deal
24:08 - and I could also acknowledge that the
24:10 - other thing I could do is I can flip
24:12 - myself oh but my words on my shirt will
24:14 - be backwards I guess maybe I'll flip use
24:17 - some CSS hacks to flip that and we can
24:20 - make that a Chrome extension for people
24:21 - who you know it could become a feature
24:24 - of the web editor itself how am I doing
24:26 - here with this laptop so far so good
24:30 - right thought I was asking what's a gist
24:35 - a github gist is a single page
24:40 - lightweight way of sharing a code
24:42 - snippet that is much more lightweight
24:44 - than creating a full github repository
24:47 - just the way of like let me quickly
24:48 - share some code with you right yes this
24:53 - is green paper I will prove to you it's
24:55 - green paper there you go now I need okay
25:07 - let's see you know certainly this is the
25:11 - kind of thing that I should do in
25:12 - advance but the way my life works these
25:14 - days is I get into this room about 10
25:17 - minutes before I set the time and so I
25:22 - very rarely yep I think that did the
25:24 - trick I very rarely I have a lot of I
25:34 - did spend some time here yesterday at
25:36 - least getting this new computer working
25:37 - so I've got a bit of a faster computer I
25:39 - have an e key that works I would like to
25:41 - get if I was thinking of getting a
25:42 - mechanical keyboard was that when when
25:47 - what was her name
25:49 - when sorry when new Katsu's was here
25:52 - okay this is a shorter URL me I okay so
25:57 - I've got it from me I am so me there was
26:00 - a bug in it me I am so me that well we
26:02 - would probably I would love to fix if
26:03 - possible which is that but let me try
26:07 - getting that first so me me I am so
26:13 - me dot so me I am so dot me a dot txt
26:19 - oh no but I needed so that's good what
26:26 - was useful to me was somebody made a
26:30 - version that was like that I couldn't
26:34 - turn into like a little JavaScript
26:35 - bookmarklet and I could just press and
26:38 - it flipped it around otherwise I suppose
26:40 - I could add this in like by going to the
26:43 - developer console or something I should
26:47 - know how to do this right and if I go
26:50 - down like here into like the styles or
26:53 - something and I also want to make this
26:55 - bigger like I can add it here somehow
27:00 - it's amazing that I don't know how to do
27:02 - this right that's B dot txt okay so what
27:11 - I'm going to do this is a little I do
27:14 - have a video tutorial about making a
27:15 - bookmarklet bookmarks bar new add page
27:22 - so I think did it have JavaScript you so
27:25 - if I add this I mean you can just say oh
27:27 - no whoops
27:28 - flip p5 put this in here save and now if
27:35 - I click this yeah the bug is let's see
27:40 - if that bug is there I want to be able
27:44 - to move this back and forth yeah is
27:47 - there all anybody have any idea of had
27:48 - how I could fix this so I'd love to fix
27:52 - that I can live I can live with it for
27:55 - right now but this would be then people
28:00 - are going to ask how do I flip it so I
28:02 - better acknowledge that I'm doing that
28:04 - I'm going to I can also like yeah but
28:09 - that's fine how can I remove this
28:12 - whatever okay let me lock my thing in
28:19 - here so that good I didn't spend too
28:21 - much time on that lock oh that looks
28:25 - like ah
28:27 - get a little more green right on the
28:29 - worst tiny bit more green sorry
28:44 - everybody I'm kind of an idiot because I
28:46 - don't need all that space but just
28:52 - didn't do it high enough over here now
28:55 - I'm gonna need another piece of tape no
29:00 - easy way to fix that okay well I will
29:02 - just live with it I think that's okay
29:14 - the other thing I was gonna do is flip
29:16 - myself but I think I'll keep it this way
29:28 - okay one more piece of tape and we
29:33 - should be ready ah the worst of this do
29:38 - it evenly I have to like undo it how do
29:53 - we do there all right can you notice
29:56 - anything let's let's minimize this and
29:58 - see yeah
30:00 - all right of course if I walk over here
30:01 - it's a little bit weird but that's fine
30:03 - okay we are in good shape just pretend
30:16 - there's a pulley that's very good
30:17 - feedback all right I think I'm ready
30:41 - I'm just cycling the cameras here
31:03 - by the way for sale I'm like a NASCAR
31:07 - driver here with my new laptop just
31:10 - kidding I mean I'm not kidding water h2o
31:15 - get back to me all right
31:21 - um I don't think that I need oops
31:27 - shoots wrong button okay I don't think
31:38 - that I need this list written out here
31:40 - anymore if somebody could help me to
31:44 - remember it obviously you can take a
31:47 - snapshot of it but it's pretty obvious
32:02 - so let me be clear about what I'm doing
32:04 - here I'm actually teaching at NYU a new
32:07 - online course for any and NYU undergrad
32:11 - to sign up for and learn to code it's
32:14 - all gonna happen online through a Google
32:16 - classroom and there's lots of features
32:19 - for interaction and discussion and
32:20 - sharing of sketches there the videos for
32:23 - that course are what I'm doing here on
32:25 - this channel for the public to consume I
32:28 - have a dream of someday having also a
32:30 - version of the course like that public
32:33 - people could sign up for in some way but
32:34 - I'm not ready for that yet
32:35 - like to do things small and
32:36 - incrementally so I am NOT going to be
32:40 - referencing that course in the public
32:42 - videos but I do need to make some
32:44 - specific content I have to hear some
32:47 - things out so this first video that I'm
32:49 - about to do will introduce the course
32:51 - and I don't do scripts sometimes I have
32:58 - a good mental outline of what I want to
32:59 - talk about sometimes I just spin my
33:02 - wheels I'm not really sure what's gonna
33:05 - happen right now but I am going to just
33:09 - do my best
33:10 - can I raise this up a tiny bit and I'm
33:18 - gonna go to p5.js pork and processing
33:24 - foundation org and across the state type
33:29 - work okay oh boy I don't want to be a
33:32 - process just about this but I need to
33:34 - make a new video for the homepage of
33:36 - processing on org okay somebody baked
33:38 - get me to do that and my phone is
33:41 - ringing I got a highlighter out the
33:43 - notifications on this b IM Samia terms
33:49 - of a pull request request let's actually
33:51 - let me talk to a cassie who's the
33:53 - creator of the web editor and see take
33:56 - her temperature on that and whether
33:58 - that's gonna get in the way of other
33:59 - things that are happening but I'm I'm
34:01 - interested in that as a feature and I I
34:03 - blow that extra preferences so anyway
34:06 - let's we'll have a discussion about that
34:08 - sorry me and Sookie was asked about
34:10 - whether to like actually pull requests
34:12 - making this flipping
34:14 - a feature of the web editor itself okay
34:22 - let's see what can I go to reference
34:24 - yeah that's good or exhibition maybe
34:27 - exhibition will be good okay
34:35 - I think bothering me that my laptop is
34:39 - like kind of off but I also want to be
34:42 - further this way all the way all the way
34:44 - all the way all the way all the way all
34:46 - the way all the way perfect
34:49 - alright I'm ready
35:03 - okay
35:04 - I'm gonna wing it that's what I always
35:07 - do I could always do it again right you
35:09 - guys Oh too much I remake the content
35:13 - again I was actually I rewatched about a
35:16 - week ago my other intro to p5 video and
35:21 - in that video I said like I said the
35:25 - middle like boy this is completely
35:26 - different than my last attempt but I
35:27 - wasn't live-streaming at the time so I
35:29 - clearly had done it a few times I also
35:31 - thought that video was kind of terrible
35:35 - so anyway alright welcome to the first
35:47 - video in what is the playlist of many
35:50 - many many probably too many videos about
35:53 - learning to code if you have never
35:55 - written any code before if you've never
35:57 - programmed before if you don't know
35:59 - anything about programming it's my
36:01 - intention for this playlist to be for
36:04 - you so this is the first introductory
36:06 - video I'm just gonna talk about the
36:08 - pieces of the puzzle that I'm going to
36:10 - use throughout this video series and
36:13 - show you where all those things are and
36:15 - kind of a little bit about the history
36:16 - of those things just to get started in
36:19 - learning to code learning to code you
36:22 - don't have to have know anything and all
36:23 - you need is a computer with a web
36:25 - browser to follow along you don't have
36:26 - to download anything install anything
36:28 - I'm so excited about that now here's the
36:30 - thing if you choose today August 31st
36:36 - 2018 if this is the time of the
36:40 - recording there's many videos that
36:41 - follow this in the playlist many of
36:43 - those videos were done a year ago two
36:46 - years ago three years ago they're using
36:48 - the same exact stuff that I'm going to
36:50 - show you but the screen is going to look
36:52 - a little bit different so I'm starting
36:54 - over because there's a new tool that
36:56 - just came out today called the p5.js web
36:58 - editor and it's the tool that I want to
37:00 - use for people following this tutorial
37:03 - series so the first few videos will have
37:05 - that tool in it and the rest of the
37:07 - videos are just gonna have the same
37:08 - concepts that you could keep using in
37:10 - that editor and maybe someday all of
37:12 - them will be replaced I have no idea I'm
37:13 - gonna stop talking about that that's not
37:15 - the important part but I want
37:16 - make that clear if you happen to be if
37:19 - you're just one of like race ahead and
37:20 - see all videos alright so what does it
37:24 - mean to learn to program what does it
37:27 - mean to program what it means to program
37:30 - is to write instructions for the
37:32 - computer to follow now this can happen
37:36 - in a number of different ways but you
37:39 - need a programming language which
37:43 - provides a syntax okay I was doing fine
37:47 - but then I I needed to stop for a second
37:50 - I feel like I can always stop and we can
37:52 - have an edit point when I'm doing the
37:54 - thing where I come over here I don't
37:57 - know why I'm coming over there alright I
38:03 - will address this Luka asks I'm curious
38:06 - why are you making a whole other series
38:07 - when you've already done it it's a very
38:10 - valid question and I'm not confident
38:12 - it's a good decision to do this in terms
38:14 - of you know give an infinite time it
38:16 - would definitely make sense but I do
38:18 - think it's important it's hard for
38:19 - people to follow that tutorial series if
38:22 - they because there's not a sort of
38:24 - central I want to I want to restart it
38:26 - with the p5 web editor so okay okay okay
38:39 - what does it mean to program the
38:42 - computer what it means the program the
38:44 - computer is to write a set of
38:46 - instructions for the computer to follow
38:48 - you right now as a human being could
38:51 - write me a set of instructions to follow
38:52 - you could say do some jumping jacks and
38:55 - you could say touch your nose and touch
38:57 - your head and like I don't know stretch
38:59 - your hamstring muscle which is the thing
39:00 - that I really need to do with all these
39:01 - backups but that aside what were say
39:06 - talking about oh that that's the kind of
39:09 - thing that we could do with each other
39:10 - as human beings but there's something
39:12 - interesting about that right if you said
39:13 - to me do some jumping jacks I'm able to
39:16 - do them you could say
39:33 - thank you much for being an editor I
39:35 - didn't have an editor in the past um you
39:44 - could say do some jumping jacks you
39:46 - could say jump up and down with your
39:49 - hands going up and your feet going out
39:51 - you could say please would you do some
39:52 - jumping jacks or jumping jacks do
39:54 - jumping jacks do you could say in all
39:56 - sorts of different ways and through kind
39:58 - of human interpretation I could
40:00 - understand what you're trying to say and
40:02 - interpret it and follow your
40:04 - instructions programming and program the
40:07 - computer to do something is a different
40:08 - process you have to be very very
40:10 - specific and you can't get things out of
40:13 - order or make a slight mistake or miss a
40:15 - word or miss a piece of punctuation and
40:18 - this is called syntax this is like
40:22 - probably the least interesting thing to
40:24 - start talking about when you start
40:25 - talking about learning to program but
40:26 - the reason why I was thinking about it
40:28 - is because you need a particular
40:30 - language in which to communicate with
40:32 - the computer and languages can be high
40:35 - level or low level meaning they can
40:37 - sound more like common language or they
40:39 - can sound more technical and cryptic
40:41 - they can be manipulating the internal
40:44 - memory and guts of the computer directly
40:46 - or they could be just writing some
40:49 - instructions or something that sounds
40:50 - like English but then is translated by
40:54 - some other system this tent up against
41:00 - was good I'm gonna start this part over
41:04 - let's give me like a there's gonna be a
41:06 - couple Mulligan's on this eventually
41:08 - I'll get into the rhythm of this
41:20 - yeah pseudocode yes describe right you
41:25 - should start with pseudocode that's a
41:27 - good Kelli Murphy is giving me a good
41:32 - some good suggestions I just want to
41:34 - kind of hit the bell okay so what does
41:44 - it mean to program so what I mean by
41:46 - programming coding is writing
41:49 - instructions for the computer to follow
41:50 - up and you might think of that and in
41:52 - this course the way that I'm going to
41:54 - start it's going to be all about writing
41:56 - instructions for the computer to draw a
41:59 - picture now there's many different
42:00 - applications of coding related to data
42:04 - and sound and music and text and web
42:07 - sites and but the place that I'm going
42:09 - to start in this course is drawing
42:11 - pictures and animation it's not the
42:14 - correct way or the best way even to
42:16 - learn to program but it's the way that
42:17 - can be that I'm comfortable with and
42:19 - that I think is well suited for certain
42:22 - audience and perhaps you watching this
42:24 - if not I don't know so I might say
42:27 - something like draw a rectangle and
42:29 - that's the instruction and then the
42:31 - computer draws a rectangle to the screen
42:34 - I might say something like draw ten
42:36 - rectangles and then the computer would
42:38 - draw ten rectangles to the screen this
42:40 - is much like how you might say to me do
42:42 - a jumping jack and I would do this or do
42:43 - ten jumping jacks and I would do ten
42:46 - jumping jacks well there was something
42:49 - about stretching my hamstrings as I said
42:50 - earlier looks a good joke think I cut
42:52 - out yeah this is getting better
42:59 - this is a better I'm gonna get the
43:01 - hamstring thing good I think I have it
43:04 - in my head now have you guys ever seen
43:07 - the movie Groundhog Day
43:08 - welcome to Groundhog Day
43:11 - [Music]
43:15 - all right so what does it mean to
43:18 - program the computer so what it means to
43:20 - probe computer is to write a set of
43:23 - instructions for the computer to follow
43:24 - and the way that I'm going to frame that
43:27 - for the purpose of this course is all
43:29 - about writing instructions for the
43:31 - computer to draw pictures so in other
43:34 - words you could imagine a window on the
43:36 - computer screen and you're providing
43:39 - instructions for things that should
43:40 - appear in the window draw a rectangle
43:42 - draw a blue rectangle draw ten
43:45 - rectangles draw a rectangle in a circle
43:47 - that erected on a circle and alternate
43:49 - the colors black and white black and
43:50 - white black and white there are so many
43:52 - ways that we could think about how UB
43:53 - might in English or whatever your native
43:56 - languages instruct the computer to
43:58 - follow some algorithm and algorithm
44:01 - being a series of steps to execute to
44:05 - solve a problem writing code is code
44:07 - instructions to execute an algorithm a
44:11 - series of steps to solve some Tunica
44:13 - problem now in this course we're not
44:16 - gonna necessarily stop but I'm hopefully
44:17 - you might solve some problems but you
44:19 - can also just play around an experiment
44:21 - and make beautiful pictures and that's
44:23 - where we're gonna start but we need some
44:26 - way of doing this together drawing a
44:30 - rectangle drum circle the computer
44:32 - doesn't understand that you and I could
44:34 - understand that if we speak the same
44:36 - language or even if we don't we might be
44:39 - able to use body language or some other
44:41 - way of kind of human intuition to
44:42 - communicate but the computer requires
44:45 - specific syntax and the syntax that you
44:52 - need the syntax is defined by the
44:54 - programming language you choose to write
44:57 - your code in and boy oh boy oh boy you
45:01 - know Google go have fun googling what's
45:03 - the best programming language to learn
45:04 - in 2400 and that doesn't make any sense
45:07 - to 20 20 40 whatever time in the future
45:10 - that you're watching this video I don't
45:12 - I'm not gonna worry myself with any of
45:14 - that stuff I'm gonna pick something I'm
45:16 - going to pick a programming language
45:17 - called JavaScript the reason I'm going
45:21 - to pick it is because it
45:23 - that's the one that I know a little bit
45:25 - and it also happens to be one in which
45:28 - there is a particularly Brer II and I'll
45:29 - talk about what that is that is a
45:32 - library of code of helper functions of
45:34 - things that will help you along in
45:36 - JavaScript called p5.js and this is a
45:39 - particularly Brer II that's created by a
45:41 - nonprofit organization called the
45:43 - processing foundation I'll include lots
45:45 - of links about the process foundation
45:48 - all of its initiatives it's an
45:49 - open-source project which means it is
45:51 - all they're available all about how
45:54 - p5.js works is all available for you to
45:57 - learn and find out about and as a
45:59 - beginner one of the missions of p5 is
46:01 - beginners learning the code cannot
46:03 - aren't just users of p5 but can be
46:06 - contributors to p5 so you can
46:08 - participate in helping to make this tool
46:10 - that you are learning to use I encourage
46:13 - you to get involved with that and I'm
46:14 - happy to help facilitate that so by the
46:17 - way p5 gas also grew out of another
46:19 - project that's part of the processing
46:21 - foundation which is just called
46:22 - processing it uses this is very
46:24 - confusing i Raza must stop talking about
46:26 - different programming languages I can
46:27 - it's built on top of a programming
46:29 - language called Java which sounds a lot
46:31 - like JavaScript and in fact JavaScript
46:33 - was named JavaScript because at the time
46:35 - Java was like this super cool thing to
46:38 - use and it still is for me I suppose I
46:41 - mean I like it but I don't know if
46:43 - you've ever been to one of those
46:44 - webpages where it's like giving you lots
46:45 - of error messages about a Java applet
46:47 - it's not so well suited for sharing on
46:49 - the web and JavaScript is the
46:52 - programming language of the browser so
46:55 - if you want to make this strange picture
46:57 - which is Square Circle Square Circle
46:59 - Square happen in the browser by writing
47:03 - instructions in JavaScript you can use
47:05 - the p5.js library you can share it
47:08 - instantly with your friends with your
47:10 - family with your co-workers with your
47:12 - fellow students you can get feedback I'm
47:15 - going to show you how to do all of this
47:16 - in this video series pause pause pause
47:21 - pause pause
47:29 - now again it's important to note this is
47:31 - not the only way to learn to program you
47:33 - know if you were here in the room with
47:35 - me out ask you to just like shout out
47:36 - the names of other programming languages
47:38 - do you know about you might say like
47:39 - Python or C or C sharp or COBOL or PHP
47:47 - oh oh I don't know something else there
47:51 - Java blah blah blah we could keep going
47:52 - on and on and these are in no particular
47:54 - order my goal for you in this course is
47:58 - to learn about the concepts of
48:01 - programming to be creative with
48:03 - programming to discover how to realize
48:06 - your own ideas through coding and both
48:09 - and this is a nice place for us to start
48:12 - we're gonna get the benefit of be able
48:14 - to put our stuff instantly in the web
48:15 - browser and if someday you discover some
48:18 - of these other tools make sense for
48:20 - other projects they would like to learn
48:21 - this is going to give you a foundation
48:23 - of knowledge for that in this playlist
48:26 - in this series and all the videos that
48:28 - I'm going to make them and I'll walk you
48:30 - through learning to code you will also
48:32 - select by accident learn a little bit
48:34 - about something called HTML and a CSS
48:41 - HTML and CSS or the other pieces of the
48:45 - puzzle for making something appear on a
48:47 - web page I'm going to focus focus focus
48:49 - on JavaScript and you're not gonna see
48:51 - anything about HTML and CSS for quite a
48:53 - while but there's these underlying other
48:56 - mechanics for how content is formatted
49:00 - and styled to appear on a webpage so
49:03 - while this is not a web development
49:05 - course because think about web
49:07 - development you might by accident learn
49:10 - to do some web development by taking
49:13 - well you're really taking this course
49:14 - but by watching these videos and
49:16 - following along yeah like what if I
49:20 - missed this is actually being recorded
49:21 - right now as part of a live stream let
49:23 - me go check to see if there's any
49:24 - questions all right
49:33 - no I forgot I should have mentioned like
49:37 - scratch or blockly that's a good dose
49:40 - some good feedback in questions all
49:46 - right looking in the chat I do have a
49:50 - CSS tutorial and I will be I'm yes so my
50:02 - goal I had a regular schedule but I hope
50:04 - to be here every Friday continuing doing
50:06 - this stuff and other things too if
50:09 - you've ever written COBOL Neal's writes
50:11 - if you've ever written COBOL PHP will
50:14 - come the greatest language of all time
50:16 - yeah I shouldn't have gone down a list
50:17 - of programming languages all people are
50:18 - gonna talk about
50:19 - I forgot jQuery that's not a programming
50:21 - language it's like a people hungry all
50:25 - right all right enough with the enough
50:27 - with the enough with the require 8 so ok
50:38 - so let me pull up the I just want to get
50:47 - that medium post up again so I can
50:52 - reference it
51:01 - oh my god well hello kinfolk sorry
51:22 - all right
51:33 - all right
51:52 - I'm sad I'm very sad that the joke with
51:58 - the stretch you got the hamstrings of my
51:59 - back problem is not gonna make it into
52:01 - the final I'll have to live with that
52:04 - math arrow in the way here okay all
52:09 - right uh all right all right let me move
52:15 - on with this I think that was fine it
52:18 - was it is what it is and now I'm going
52:21 - to move on all right so I'm wrapping up
52:29 - this first video this sort of
52:31 - introduction I suppose I should probably
52:32 - introduce myself a little bit if this
52:34 - happens to be the first video that
52:35 - you're watching I no no no I don't need
52:39 - to draw forget about that all right so
52:46 - I'm wrapping up this video and then the
52:51 - next video it's really where I'm to get
52:52 - started I'm gonna show you this is what
52:55 - you type and this is what happens and
52:57 - this is why what this happens when you
52:59 - type it and this is what happens if you
53:00 - type it this way this breaks it but this
53:02 - way fixes it and we're just gonna rinse
53:04 - and repeat and rinse repeat do that over
53:06 - and over again for all the little
53:08 - fundamental pieces of building blocks of
53:10 - learning to create your own software but
53:14 - I want to just show you a few URLs that
53:16 - you can sort of poke around and read
53:18 - about before you move on to the next
53:20 - video if you're interested so this is
53:22 - the p5.js website this is the website
53:25 - that has a place where you can sort of
53:30 - learn about the p5.js project this
53:32 - reference page is gonna be very
53:34 - important because it's the place we're
53:35 - gonna look up like I forgot what's this
53:37 - thing does we're gonna look at the
53:38 - reference page this learn page has some
53:42 - additional tutorials that you could look
53:43 - at there's lots of examples here that we
53:46 - could click around and play with I'll
53:48 - just show you one right now let's go to
53:50 - soft body and you can see like oh this
53:52 - looks fun so this is the kind of thing
53:54 - that you're gonna learn how to do how do
53:55 - you draw a shape with an algorithm how
53:58 - do you define a set of steps to draw
54:00 - something and then how do you control
54:02 - its motion and behavior I don't like
54:05 - that I picked that
54:07 - let me try that again we could pick a an
54:22 - example to look at like the game of life
54:24 - here the game of life is a particular
54:27 - type of generative algorithm I'm gonna
54:29 - run it again which involves lighting up
54:32 - cells on a grid black white black white
54:34 - based on what's next to it and creates
54:36 - this fun biological crazy
54:46 - that's one what's one that I I'm just a
54:48 - flocking one why am I just why I always
54:50 - should just do the one we could
54:52 - pull up one of these examples like I
54:54 - could click on this one called flocking
54:55 - and you can see oh this is kind of slow
54:59 - that is no no bad game of life was
55:07 - better what is with all these game of
55:16 - life is better
55:30 - snake game oh my god there's a snake
55:34 - game example Oh convenient you stuck
55:46 - here okay Nicole like sweaty like really
55:49 - very stressed out I would go back to the
55:51 - game of life I could just click I could
55:55 - just click on example like game of life
55:56 - here and we could see ah this is the
55:58 - code ah what is what is going on here
56:00 - this looks crazy look at all this syntax
56:02 - and punctuation and stuff by the end of
56:05 - this whole playlist of series this will
56:06 - make does that does ever make sense to
56:10 - anybody looking at code that you didn't
56:11 - write I'm not really sure but you will
56:13 - start to understand what the pieces are
56:14 - what is the process for building up a
56:17 - particular project like this and this is
56:19 - a well known algorithm called the game
56:22 - of life it's a mathematical algorithm
56:23 - that involves you know how cells on a
56:27 - grid turn black or white based on what
56:30 - the other cells are doing it's kind of
56:31 - like this bacterial like stimulation so
56:34 - oh there's so many things we can do I
56:35 - actually have a whole video tutorial
56:36 - building this up from scratch you could
56:38 - go and find but stay with me here so
56:40 - this is the p5.js website once again
56:42 - automated p5.js was made actually one
56:45 - other thing I want to point out here is
56:48 - I want to go here on community I think
56:50 - it's a p5 has a really wonderful
56:53 - community statement which is really
56:54 - important so I encourage you to go to
56:56 - the p5 just commune your statement and
56:58 - read it p5 chess is created by the
57:02 - processing foundation I'll show you the
57:03 - processing foundation runs the
57:05 - fellowship program and here's a whole
57:07 - lot of people Lauren McCarthy is the
57:10 - creator of the p5 just library you can
57:12 - learn more about the how does this how
57:15 - did this project come about by looking
57:16 - at the processing foundation website the
57:18 - original processing project which is the
57:20 - Java based platform if you're looking
57:22 - for inspiration I'm particularly
57:23 - recommend this exhibition page where you
57:25 - can find really lots of interesting and
57:27 - beautiful interactive projects made with
57:30 - code ok now
57:35 - here's the part that I'm so excited
57:38 - about because this is like branding this
57:39 - is a project two years in the making but
57:41 - it's brand new in terms of its
57:42 - announcement today at the time of me
57:44 - making this video the p5.js web editor
57:47 - this is an editor that you can use that
57:51 - you can use and write code in the
57:55 - browser save your projects share your
57:57 - projects with look there's that David
57:59 - life thing again
58:00 - with without anything they don't need to
58:03 - download anything at all and I'm gonna
58:05 - show you how to look there I am that's
58:07 - weird and I'm going to show you how to
58:10 - use the p5.js editor while you're
58:12 - learning to code I do want to mention
58:14 - that if you are interested in all of the
58:16 - features of the web editor watch this
58:19 - video by Cassie terre occasion this is
58:21 - not a beginner programming video but
58:23 - it's a video for people who might know a
58:24 - bit about programming already to see
58:27 - what the things a web editor can do
58:29 - actually walks you through every all of
58:31 - the features accessibility is a core
58:35 - feature of the p5 web editor if you are
58:39 - low vision or blind there are a lot of
58:41 - features built into the web editors
58:43 - allow you to code with it and matura
58:45 - talks about all the people who
58:46 - contributed to that effort and those
58:48 - accessibility features in this video as
58:50 - well as if you are a teacher and you
58:54 - want to teach with p5 maybe you want to
58:55 - use these videos or make your own or
58:57 - write your own curriculum sabor Khan who
59:00 - does education outreach for the
59:02 - processing foundation talks about that
59:03 - in this video and I am planning to make
59:06 - my own series about how to use the p5
59:08 - web editor and Google classroom together
59:09 - so if you're interested in that stay
59:11 - tuned I'll be making a video on that
59:12 - okay so now this is the p5 web editor um
59:19 - there it is so well look this is some
59:22 - code that doesn't look so bad function
59:24 - setup what does that create canvas what
59:26 - is that background 2:20 what does that
59:28 - function draw what is that this is all
59:30 - the stuff that I'm going to talk about
59:32 - precisely in the next video so in the
59:35 - next video I'm gonna show you what kinds
59:38 - of things can you type here what ends up
59:40 - happening over here when you type them
59:41 - and why and we're just gonna go from
59:44 - there video after video after video
59:46 - adding
59:47 - piece than this piece and this piece and
59:49 - by the end you can make your own
59:50 - interactive animated game artwork data
59:54 - visualization who knows you're going to
59:56 - be much more creative and come up with
59:58 - something much better than I could
59:59 - possibly imagine right now okay
60:00 - so if you're excited about that great
60:02 - keep on watching there's also lots of
60:05 - other things in the world besides
60:06 - programming like so you could go do that
60:09 - stuff too and especially like being with
60:11 - people and hugging your neighbors and
60:12 - stuff like that that sounded weird I
60:14 - have you for that somewhere I'm gonna go
60:15 - now I have to stretch my hamstrings
60:17 - because I have got some back problems
60:19 - and that's gonna help I see I got that
60:22 - in there alright see you all later in
60:23 - the next video and everybody in the chat
60:32 - is talking about which programming
60:33 - language they love the best for whatever
60:34 - reason alright
60:36 - that's gonna be okay right me I am so me
60:53 - do I need to do I need to re say
60:56 - something else at the end there yeah
61:01 - that's gonna stop with the dab
61:02 - requesting cuz I it's it's too much noiz
61:04 - in the chat so I'm not going to do it
61:05 - let's see Oh getting text method on me I
61:12 - just got a text message from Cynthia
61:14 - Nixon
61:15 - the New York governor's race I was like
61:17 - oh the big sin is texting me in any rise
61:19 - no I don't think that's a personal
61:21 - message oh right
61:29 - I think it went well Thank You Marshall
61:36 - okay so this is what the good news is I
61:38 - have gotten past what is the harder part
61:41 - for me slack channel participants when
61:48 - I'm done with the live stream today if
61:49 - you are there
61:50 - could you please remind me I need to
61:53 - make I need to stay a little longer and
61:55 - make a quick intro for the actual NYU
61:58 - course that just talks about the NYU
62:00 - bureaucracy stuff it's you're not
62:02 - missing anything I just need to not
62:04 - forget that because I the course
62:05 - launches on Tuesday this is not the
62:07 - eraser that I use and I want to make
62:10 - sure I have that okay
62:23 - alright ok so it looks like I got a
62:31 - super chat thank you to mr. Uggla help I
62:40 - am watching an insane man Babylon indeed
62:44 - that is exactly what you were doing
62:50 - [Music]
62:56 - ok alright so
63:20 - all right Oh into p5.js org all right
63:30 - okay I'm gonna do drawing I got a couple
63:36 - talking about drawing coordinate systems
63:38 - and shapes in this video alright oh wait
63:48 - so I guess I'm gonna do this flip thing
63:54 - that's weird that might but I think
63:57 - maybe I still need to like I mean the
64:00 - thing is if I'm going to do this then
64:03 - what's the point of doing the flip thing
64:05 - I mean I could just leave it like this
64:08 - but I could also do this and flip and
64:12 - then and I could kind of more come over
64:17 - more this way and then I have more I
64:21 - don't know how do i oh there it is yeah
64:29 - like I could do this and then like if
64:35 - I'm just whoa
64:42 - and then you know if I'm saying like
64:47 - just try to figure this out so I mean
65:00 - talking about the code we see it over
65:04 - here I mean I can kind of do this and
65:05 - imagine that I'm referencing the screen
65:11 - anybody have any feedback about the
65:13 - layout thing like so these are my
65:16 - options like kind of use just part of
65:23 - the screen and stand kind of off to the
65:28 - right but have the code over there so
65:31 - it's okay if I'm a little bit in front
65:32 - of this while I'm talking I think this
65:35 - is the best because then I could sort of
65:37 - back off and talk about this or I can
65:39 - kind of move over and talk about this I
65:46 - think I'm gonna leave it like this for
65:48 - right now but at first I'm gonna do this
65:49 - so the video starts oh it's like this I
65:53 - know you guys I know everybody watching
65:56 - is about 30 seconds behind me so oh I
66:01 - should have been that I guess I need to
66:07 - make something about signing up for an
66:10 - account all right so let me
66:23 - oops no at the moment that the reason
66:30 - why I don't want to do that yeah there's
66:33 - some okay
66:51 - so the one problem I have people are
66:57 - commenting on the layout stuff and it's
67:00 - a little bit unfortunate but I have no
67:01 - idea what you're referencing because you
67:04 - are like 30 to 45 seconds at a different
67:06 - time so so Matthew I don't know what you
67:18 - meant and there's also the dark theme I
67:22 - think yes let me just check that there's
67:28 - dark which I could use but if I do that
67:30 - I definitely need to use the high
67:30 - contrast I think I think this actually
67:33 - looks better on the on YouTube the white
67:35 - one all right I'm gonna I'm gonna leave
67:44 - I'm gonna use my own instincts here and
67:47 - I'm gonna do it like this
67:57 - yellow on left then code then window Oh
68:04 - got it
68:06 - editor on right okay
68:21 - oh boy this is way too hard for me to
68:24 - decide coding on the right canvas on the
68:26 - left okay great so I'm gonna do this but
68:29 - I'm going to leave myself a little bit
68:30 - of buffer zone here okay the reason why
68:34 - I went to incognito mode was to have a
68:38 - view of it without being logged
68:50 - okay
68:52 - coating on the right canvas on the left
68:54 - okay great that's what everybody seems
68:55 - to be saying
69:04 - all right you're wrong what time is it
69:14 - oh it's not even six o'clock that's a
69:16 - good sign
69:16 - because I think this will be pretty fast
69:18 - you know I waste so much time in between
69:20 - I appreciate everybody saying let's use
69:29 - the dark theme I'm a little bit
69:31 - concerned about how that's gonna look
69:34 - just in terms of my seeing it on the
69:37 - monitor it looks weird but you guys are
69:39 - you are all actually watching Yeah right
69:49 - hi let me just try it
69:53 - settings yeah this is actually pretty
70:00 - good so I think I'm gonna leave it like
70:02 - this high contrast people are okay with
70:06 - a high contrast so I'm gonna change it
70:08 - to that though just to show show that
70:12 - feature this is the dark I think it
70:16 - needs to be the high contrast now we
70:19 - prefer the high contrast all right light
70:27 - theme looks better on YouTube
70:36 - so I'm looking for in the slack channel
70:40 - kind of do this real quick
70:51 - sorry everybody this is kind of
70:53 - important to get this right
71:02 - and in the in the poll that I just
71:04 - posted in the slack Channel
71:07 - when I say dark no dark means the high
71:11 - contrast I'm not gonna do the dark
71:15 - without the high contrast I don't think
71:17 - that's right as a colorblind person I
71:22 - appreciate the high contrast okay okay
71:26 - seems to be the popular one okay so just
71:31 - so everybody knows I am having it start
71:36 - like this cuz this is what you're gonna
71:41 - see by default and I will switch it
71:44 - alright thank you for everybody for
71:47 - bearing with me here all right okay I
71:59 - got a good start with this
72:12 - hello I'm back so this is the first
72:15 - video where I'm actually gonna start
72:17 - coding in p5 with the web editor that's
72:21 - those weirdoes very good hello I'm back
72:25 - so this in this video I'm going to start
72:28 - coding in p5 with the p5 just web editor
72:32 - for the first time on this coding train
72:34 - YouTube channel so if you go to you
72:38 - should what if you're following along
72:39 - you should go to editor p5.js org and
72:42 - you will see something that looks like
72:44 - this now I'm in an incognito window here
72:46 - because I want to show you what it looks
72:48 - like being logged out what you're going
72:50 - to see on the top right you're gonna see
72:52 - login or signup so if you've already
72:54 - made an account you'll want to log in
72:56 - but more likely you if you're watching
72:58 - this for the first time you're going to
72:59 - want to click on signup this should be
73:03 - its own video because I think I need to
73:06 - I think I think if I'm gonna have a
73:11 - video about drawing with p5 you
73:14 - shouldn't have to watch like even if
73:16 - it's just 5 minutes long about setting
73:17 - up that this probably should have been
73:18 - in the previous video but too late
73:21 - alright sorry let me just give me one
73:22 - more time here ok hi
73:27 - so before X I know I said that in the
73:29 - next you watch the previously I said the
73:30 - next video I'm gonna start coding
73:32 - apologies I'm not gonna start coding
73:34 - just yet I didn't do one more thing I'm
73:36 - going to show you how to get set up with
73:38 - the web editor itself so the first thing
73:41 - you want to do is go to a web browser
73:42 - I'm using the Chrome web browser but the
73:45 - the and I'm on a Mac but you could be on
73:47 - any other computer and using a different
73:50 - web browser as well you want to go to
73:51 - the URL editor dot p5.js org that's
73:55 - where you want to go you can follow
73:56 - along and go there right now
73:58 - what you're gonna see is something that
73:59 - looks like this this is the web editor
74:02 - and you can actually just start coding
74:03 - but I'm going to show you what these
74:05 - things mean but like what if I change
74:07 - this background number to zero and then
74:10 - I run up here and there's this button
74:11 - here this this button it looks like a
74:13 - play button like I'm gonna play on my
74:15 - old timey VCR well really this is gonna
74:17 - run that code and I'm gonna see well
74:19 - look at this there's a square with a
74:23 - black background over there
74:24 - if I change this to 100 and I click play
74:27 - again who that the color of that change
74:29 - where they say 100 comma zero comma 200
74:31 - now the colors purple so I'm off I'm off
74:34 - the train is off the tracks but I'm
74:37 - going to come back and explain what all
74:39 - these things are how you type them why
74:40 - you type them and what they mean later
74:42 - but the thing is like this is my opus
74:45 - now I have made this beautiful wonderful
74:47 - p5 sketch and I wanna share it with the
74:49 - world
74:50 - I can't I can't I could go to file and I
74:54 - can click Save but it says in order to
74:56 - save sketches you must be logged in so
74:58 - at the moment the editor doesn't have
75:00 - any way to save something without you
75:01 - having an account you can play around
75:03 - but what you'll want to do is go to sign
75:05 - up so if you you might already have it
75:06 - account you can go to log in I'm gonna
75:08 - click sign up and here what you can do
75:11 - is you can create a username and email
75:13 - and a password and if you are if you
75:17 - don't have your own email address you
75:18 - know you you can and you have a parent
75:20 - or somebody else that you can ask to use
75:23 - their email address to sign up that's
75:25 - what I would suggest doing so you want
75:27 - to create that account you don't need to
75:28 - use your email other than just for the
75:30 - signing up so once you've signed up and
75:33 - you've logged in you're now I'm going to
75:36 - leave this you're gonna see something
75:37 - like this now I created an account
75:39 - called coding train and it will say
75:41 - hello comma the username that you picked
75:45 - so you'll see that you can go onto here
75:47 - under my account you can see there's
75:48 - things like my sketches my assets this
75:51 - is something that will if I'm gonna show
75:53 - you how to you can use images and sounds
75:55 - and upload videos to the editor those
75:58 - are things that would appear in my
75:59 - assets settings I'm gonna show you in a
76:01 - minute but now we're in p5 itself now I
76:06 - want to go back to my beautiful opus
76:08 - where I don't know why yet but somehow I
76:10 - changed some numbers and I got this
76:12 - beautiful color over there
76:13 - now I can go to file save once I've done
76:18 - that this URL up here is a you URL
76:22 - forever that that is my sketch and in
76:26 - fact I can go right up here to sketch
76:29 - notes file share and you can see look
76:34 - now I can share the code for my sketch
76:37 - here
76:38 - I can actually share a full-screen
76:40 - version of the sketch let's look at this
76:44 - look here's my beautiful sketch so now
76:47 - I'm going to show you how to make more
76:48 - interesting things and then share them
76:49 - without the code and then this is
76:51 - something called an embed so if you have
76:53 - a blog this is something where you can
76:55 - actually take your sketch and embed it
76:57 - into something else I'll come back and
76:58 - show you this stuff maybe again as we
77:01 - get further along and I'm not going to
77:03 - worry about it too much right now okay
77:05 - so we've got it here's the thing what is
77:08 - the name of this project what is the
77:10 - name of this project if i zoom in here
77:13 - the name of the project is unbiased shoe
77:15 - so this is one of my favorite things
77:17 - about the p5 web editor it will
77:19 - auto-generate a name of each sketch for
77:22 - you now the truth of the matter is you
77:24 - probably want to have some practice of
77:26 - renaming and naming it something that
77:28 - describes what it actually is I can
77:30 - click this pencil icon and I can call it
77:32 - coding trained editor demo I can hit
77:36 - enter and now the sketch has that name
77:38 - the URL this name is not part of the URL
77:41 - for sharing that sketch it's just a name
77:44 - for you to keep track of if you ever go
77:46 - to for example file open actually I want
77:49 - to it's telling me I don't want I need
77:50 - to save it first so I'm gonna go to file
77:52 - save and then I'm go to file open oops
77:59 - didn't save I found a bug
78:05 - and file open my account my sketches why
78:13 - why is it not saving weird hold on
78:17 - everybody
78:21 - save project saved
78:23 - I remember this happening I remember
78:26 - this bug we're gonna fake it for the
78:35 - purposes of this
78:47 - weird so it shouldn't be it's saved it
78:50 - shouldn't be I don't know what's going
78:52 - on I'm gonna choose not to worry about
78:54 - this yeah there we go I'm gonna choose
78:59 - not to worry about this and just ignore
79:02 - it for a little bit yeah
79:04 - yes it probably is saving it's just
79:05 - sending the prompt anyway we're gonna
79:07 - have to investigate that so Matt to you
79:08 - grab do some magic editing here so I
79:11 - could save it and then I could go I
79:13 - could so so I could now go I could now
79:17 - go to file open and I could see look
79:19 - these are other sketches now a measly
79:22 - friend is some sketch I must have
79:23 - created that I forgot to rename 10 print
79:26 - is something that I was creating so you
79:28 - can see these are the sketches that I
79:29 - have made I could go and browse my other
79:31 - ones okay now here's the thing for me to
79:35 - make my tutorials I want to I want to
79:39 - adjust a few settings visually for how
79:41 - it looks to make it easier for the
79:43 - viewer to see it and so I'm gonna go
79:45 - here under settings and one thing I
79:47 - could do under settings I've already
79:49 - changed the text size to 36 I'm gonna go
79:52 - to this high contrast theme and then I'm
79:56 - gonna close X here we're gonna see this
79:58 - is a nice high contrast theme it has a
80:00 - dark background it also is easily
80:03 - viewable for anyone with who's
80:04 - colorblind in any visual impairment so I
80:06 - think it's going to be nice for the
80:07 - video tutorials to use that theme I also
80:10 - would prefer to make sure that I'm not
80:12 - standing in front of the code by
80:13 - accident so I'm gonna do something a
80:15 - little bit weird that I've been at
80:16 - happen to mention in this video I'm
80:18 - going to move the code window to the
80:20 - other side this is not a feature of the
80:22 - editor I have someone coding trained
80:25 - contributor sent me some code that I was
80:28 - able to hack the browser and I can put
80:30 - the code on the other side and I can see
80:32 - the preview over here so I am going to
80:35 - sorry if you bear with me for a second I
80:38 - am now in my videos I'm going to have it
80:41 - look like this at some point that might
80:43 - become a feature of the editor if other
80:45 - people need this ability to flip where
80:48 - the locations are or if you really need
80:50 - to know how to do that I'll provide some
80:52 - instructions in the video description
80:53 - about how to run add a little button to
80:56 - your web browser to
80:58 - you flip this back and forth but I'm
81:01 - gonna leave it this way I think this is
81:02 - gonna allow me to code in a way that you
81:04 - can see the code over here and if I'm
81:05 - standing in front of the output every so
81:07 - often no big deal okay again this was
81:11 - not comprehensive if you want a
81:14 - comprehensive overview of all of the
81:16 - features of the web editor I will link
81:18 - to the processing foundation playlist
81:20 - there's three videos about p5 and the
81:23 - band the web editor Cassie the Creator
81:25 - the web editor does an overview matura
81:26 - talks about the accessibility features
81:28 - and there and there and there's a video
81:30 - about education with p5 from soccer as
81:32 - well so okay so now if you somehow made
81:35 - it to the end of this long rambling
81:37 - video I will really code in the next
81:40 - video in the next video I'm going to
81:41 - talk about what are the commands the
81:44 - instructions what is the syntax of
81:46 - JavaScript with the p5.js library to get
81:49 - things to appear right over here see you
81:53 - there
82:09 - oh yes sorry I forgot to show that you
82:12 - could log in with github or Google I
82:15 - think the mean is that a big deal that I
82:18 - missed that
82:24 - let me tack that on here just gonna log
82:33 - out
82:42 - one more quick thing that I want to
82:44 - mention actually thank you to some live
82:47 - viewers who pointed this out if you
82:50 - don't want to sign up for a new account
82:51 - you can actually log into the p5 web
82:54 - editor with an account that you already
82:56 - have with Google or with a website
82:57 - called github which you don't know what
83:00 - that is there's some other videos you
83:01 - could watch but you don't see those on
83:03 - the signup page so those don't show here
83:06 - but if you go to the login page you can
83:08 - see these options here
83:09 - login with github or log in with Google
83:11 - so that's another way of logging in to
83:15 - the editor I wonder if that can be
83:19 - spliced in the middle not to you if you
83:21 - can figure out a way to splice that in
83:22 - the middle that would be great is there
83:26 - a possibility to get to share code with
83:28 - other users absolutely you absolutely
83:33 - can okay I'm sure I miss stuff I'm doing
83:38 - my best all right flip didn't remember
83:44 - it doesn't remember like how I do that
83:48 - but that's fine okay why is it not
83:55 - saving this is a little bit distressing
83:58 - that this this seems to be a bug that
84:01 - this should go away oh thank you Austin
84:07 - for that bookmark
84:14 - yeah all right I don't know what's the
84:17 - deal with the saving thing but I'm gonna
84:19 - choose not to worry about it yeah weird
84:27 - oh wait hold on let's just see okay no
84:34 - problem
84:43 - and
84:58 - okay all right what do we got six
85:06 - o'clock we're doing well we're doing
85:08 - well every time I walk over here to
85:17 - cycle the camera my phone is on the
85:19 - floor charging and I see all these
85:21 - notifications I got to turn it upside
85:22 - down so it's really distracting me
85:26 - turning it upside down okay
85:38 - it also does autosave alright okay yeah
85:52 - this couch is still running but you
85:53 - should be all that people are saying
85:54 - like maybe it's not saving because the
85:55 - sketch is running I don't think so
85:57 - it's it's it's meant to be able to save
85:59 - and reload and while it's whether it's
86:01 - running or not that shouldn't affect its
86:04 - ability to like save okay by the way
86:11 - doing this where is the oh yeah this is
86:15 - over here now that's a little bit weird
86:23 - mm-hmm so one thing that I don't love
86:26 - about what I just did is but I'm not
86:28 - going to get to that until later so yeah
86:34 - that should probably by the way in this
86:36 - bookmarklet thing we should probably
86:38 - have the sidebar open up here if
86:41 - somebody wants to help with that
86:54 - hello okay it's time it is time to start
86:59 - talking about and writing some code
87:02 - what's going on here it you can see
87:05 - already that there's this function set
87:07 - up function draw what is that stuff
87:10 - there's curly brackets there's
87:11 - parentheses let's hold off on that for a
87:13 - second let's not get too worked up about
87:15 - that let's focus just for a moment on
87:17 - create canvas parentheses 400 , 400
87:22 - closed parentheses semicolon I'm going
87:26 - to write that out in a generic way I'm
87:29 - gonna say something like instruction
87:33 - another word for that might be command
87:38 - and the truth of the matter is the
87:41 - actual technical name for what I'm
87:43 - writing here is a function name function
87:50 - name instruction instruction parentheses
87:59 - some number comma some other number
88:03 - I don't know comma some other number
88:06 - comma
88:07 - well let's not put that there close
88:10 - parentheses semicolon this is the syntax
88:16 - for executing an instruction for the
88:19 - computer to follow the name of the
88:22 - instruction parentheses that open and
88:25 - close followed by a semicolon in some
88:27 - number of things in between that number
88:31 - of things could be 0 it could be 1 it
88:33 - could be 2 it could be 3 occur before it
88:35 - depends so now if we go back to create
88:39 - canvas we can see look the instruction
88:42 - is create canvas parentheses 400 comma
88:46 - 400 so ask yourself pause the video for
88:48 - a second what does 400 mean and what
88:51 - does 400 mean I mean it means the number
88:54 - 400 but like why isn't them referring
88:55 - what is it doing okay are you back did
88:58 - you think about it well one way to try
89:00 - to figure this out is for me just to say
89:01 - well why don't we just change the number
89:03 - to 235
89:06 - then ran the program already I have to
89:08 - tell it to rerun the program well it's
89:13 - half as wide but just as tall mmm by the
89:17 - way there's this interesting button over
89:19 - here Auto refresh huh
89:22 - so notice how I change the code and then
89:25 - I had to run it again
89:26 - that was a little bit inconvenient I
89:27 - mean there's it's not so bad I'm happy
89:30 - to do it as often as I need to but
89:32 - things might be a little more convenient
89:33 - if I select that because now what if I
89:35 - change this to 300 whoops 300 change
89:39 - this to 400 when I change this to 800
89:41 - it's always going to update the drawing
89:44 - the result of the instructions here what
89:47 - if I have that auto refresh clicked and
89:49 - I'm gonna go back to 400 and 400 so what
89:52 - those numbers define is the width and
89:56 - height of this thing called the canvas
89:58 - this is the drawing canvas it's the
90:01 - thing that we're going to write
90:02 - instructions to draw stuff in to move
90:04 - things around interact with things all
90:06 - eventually and the syntax for making
90:09 - this is create canvas foreigner 400 it's
90:12 - interesting there what happens if I
90:13 - delete this well so p5 by the way we'll
90:18 - always put a canvas there for you if you
90:21 - forget to say create canvas it made a
90:23 - canvas there for you but it just didn't
90:27 - know how big to make it so it takes some
90:29 - arbitrary size probably 100 by 100 but
90:31 - let's put that back there's 400 by 400
90:33 - there's a really important thing that I
90:34 - want to talk about but let's come back
90:36 - over here so create canvas this is the
90:43 - function name let's use the real
90:46 - terminology you can think of it like a
90:48 - command create canvas that's your
90:52 - command these are called the arguments I
90:59 - think earlier I didn't actually say this
91:01 - but if you were giving me instructions
91:02 - to do some exercises and you said do
91:05 - some jumping jacks I would say how many
91:08 - you need to modify you need to provide
91:11 - parameters for how I should execute the
91:14 - instruction the instructions create the
91:16 - canvas with a size of
91:19 - 400 by 300 pixels meaning create a area
91:23 - on the screen that I can draw to that's
91:26 - 400 pixels wide 300 pixels high if the
91:30 - concept of pixels is new to you on a
91:33 - computer screen every single color that
91:37 - you see is if you zoom way into it as a
91:39 - single dot now there's all sorts of
91:40 - weird funny business going on because we
91:42 - have all these high-density displays now
91:44 - that have multiple pixels for every
91:45 - pixel but all that aside the idea here
91:48 - is if I were to zoom way in
91:51 - wait-wait-wait-wait-wait way in and
91:52 - count all the dots there'd be 400 of
91:57 - them and there's 400 wide and let's
92:00 - change this to 300 just so we can see
92:02 - that's a little bit different 400 by 300
92:04 - so this is the idea now we have to ask a
92:09 - really important question I've totally
92:11 - forgotten to bring this up what is the
92:13 - difference between JavaScript we haven't
92:18 - even really gotten to the drawing stuff
92:20 - yet but don't worry we will JavaScript
92:22 - and p5 is create canvas p5 or is it
92:27 - JavaScript is 400 comma 300 p5 or is it
92:32 - JavaScript this is not an easy question
92:35 - to answer and it's a question that I
92:36 - hope will resolve itself for you over
92:39 - time as you program more and more and
92:41 - learn about other libraries besides p5
92:44 - that work with the JavaScript language
92:46 - but the key thing is here the language
92:48 - the syntax the fact that you need
92:52 - parentheses and commas and semicolons
92:54 - and names of functions go here that is
92:57 - the JavaScript language to call a
92:59 - function in JavaScript is to write the
93:03 - function name followed by parentheses
93:04 - with commas for the arguments and a
93:06 - semicolon
93:07 - that's JavaScript create canvas is a
93:11 - function that exists that is defined
93:14 - inside of the p5 library so if you did
93:16 - not have p5 if you weren't using the p5
93:19 - web editor here in some other
93:21 - environment and you wrote create canvas
93:23 - you might get an error message saying I
93:24 - don't know what create canvas is all
93:27 - programming environments and editors
93:29 - allow you to import other library
93:31 - but the p5 web editor has done this for
93:34 - you so the fact that we can execute p5
93:37 - commands right create canvas and there's
93:39 - a lot more of them means it is because
93:43 - we're using the p5 library the way we
93:45 - execute that command where the semicolon
93:48 - goes where the parentheses go where the
93:50 - commas go that is all the JavaScript
93:53 - language itself the syntax I hope that
93:55 - gives a little bit of clarity there's
93:56 - more to it than that you'll have many
93:58 - more questions but hopefully I'll keep
94:02 - answering that as we go all right so now
94:04 - where can I find out about other
94:07 - commands that I can write besides create
94:10 - canvas and when I say commands I really
94:14 - mean functions but I like to use the
94:16 - word command at least at the beginning
94:17 - because it's it's a little clearer to
94:19 - talk about what it just we're actually
94:20 - doing here you and me but technically
94:23 - these are functions that we're calling
94:24 - okay all right so the answer to that
94:29 - question is the p5.js website if I go to
94:32 - the p5 Geoff's website and I click on
94:34 - this tat this this link called reference
94:38 - this link on reference has every single
94:42 - function that's part of the p5 library
94:45 - so somewhere on here I could do a find
94:48 - we can find create canvas and I could
94:51 - click on create canvas and learn more
94:53 - about Korea canvas this is known as the
94:56 - documentation programming languages and
94:58 - programming libraries and frameworks all
95:01 - they should at least have documentation
95:03 - where you go to read about how the thing
95:06 - is supposed to work I could sit I could
95:07 - make like thousands and thousands of
95:09 - videos and just go through every one in
95:11 - one of these and explain it to you but
95:12 - learning to program is not just learning
95:15 - how to write the instructions and the
95:16 - syntax it's learning how to read
95:18 - documentation so the functions that I
95:20 - want you if you're watching this video
95:22 - series which I guess you are to follow
95:24 - first are the ones that are under 2d
95:29 - primitives this is where we're gonna
95:30 - start there are lots of functions that
95:32 - go and explore them all don't listen to
95:34 - me
95:34 - but for your first exercise after you
95:37 - watch this video just limit yourself to
95:39 - triangle rect which is short for
95:41 - rectangle quad which is an
95:43 - shape that has four vertices to it four
95:47 - sides edges point which is a single
95:51 - point line which is a line ellipse which
95:52 - is a fancy name for circle but it could
95:55 - be sort of squashed or an arc so all of
95:58 - these are could probably needs its own
95:59 - video to talk about artworks back so but
96:02 - you can explore these experiment with
96:04 - them let's start with let's just make a
96:07 - guess let's start with rect for
96:09 - rectangle and I let's not even click on
96:12 - it yet I'm just gonna go over here and
96:14 - now the drawing now I need to talk about
96:18 - what setup and draw are what are these
96:21 - blocks of code why do they start with a
96:23 - curly bracket and and a bracket I'm
96:24 - gonna come back to that for right now we
96:27 - should understand that setup is the
96:29 - place where create canvas code that's
96:31 - the beginning we're gonna set up our
96:32 - canvas draw is the place where I'm gonna
96:35 - put my stuff to draw stuff to the canvas
96:36 - there's more to it than that but that's
96:38 - the way to think about it right now so
96:41 - I'm going to go in here and I'm going to
96:43 - say all right I'm gonna zoom back out
96:46 - our ECT find out what it means to me I'm
96:51 - going to put some numbers in there shot
96:54 - him out you're not you can't hear you
96:56 - sorry I'm gonna say like 150 25
97:01 - nothing's there yet 75 senator 85-75 ah
97:05 - look at that suddenly there's a
97:07 - rectangle there so even just through
97:09 - guessing right we know the name of the
97:11 - instruction rectangle rect or ect we
97:15 - know that we need to then put maybe some
97:17 - numbers in between parentheses and then
97:19 - end with the semicolon we could just try
97:20 - be weirdly like what can I put another
97:22 - number there whoops I messed up can I
97:25 - put another number there oh yeah oh look
97:27 - at that
97:27 - what did that do so what if what's going
97:30 - on so you know what I'm gonna actually
97:32 - take the time to explain the rectangle
97:34 - function to you then we're gonna look at
97:36 - the reference page and then I don't need
97:38 - to do really the other ones because you
97:39 - can then do this for yourself you could
97:41 - type the command in you can type the
97:43 - numbers in you can turn play around and
97:45 - guess you can read the reference page
97:46 - and try to fix it then you can ask me
97:48 - questions in the comments and hopefully
97:49 - I'll be able to respond to you all right
97:51 - so let's come over here so let me take I
97:54 - need an eraser time
97:55 - for a second we can edit this let's take
97:59 - a little break for a second to strike
98:00 - and drink a little water this is like
98:12 - really long by the way does anybody have
98:15 - a guess as to like just this drawing
98:17 - video like how much time I've spent so
98:19 - far I mean I tend it's like take way too
98:22 - much time I think but I think this is
98:25 - like important pieces for the total
98:27 - beginner yea denne denne asks could you
98:40 - put the background function and set up
98:42 - as well yes so this is definitely
98:43 - something that I'm going to come back to
98:45 - and I think it's there in the future
98:47 - videos but you absolutely could put the
98:49 - background function in setup yeah all
98:55 - right all right I'm not getting any
98:59 - answers to that question that I asked
99:02 - which I don't even move what the
99:03 - question was all right let me tackle the
99:06 - camera since I'm over here I sure that
99:14 - line actually I should have done line I
99:17 - kinda want to go back and do line but
99:19 - it's fine yeah all right
99:30 - okay so I need to give myself oh space
99:34 - here and what I want to do is draw the
99:37 - canvas for you then what I want to do is
99:41 - write out this function rect and I'm
99:46 - gonna say 100 what did I what did I put
99:49 - actually in here I put 150 25 75 150 25
99:56 - 75 so how do these arguments define the
100:03 - way to draw a rectangle right
100:04 - our ECT means draw a rectangle here are
100:08 - the properties of the rectangle that I
100:10 - want to see in order to understand what
100:15 - these numbers mean we need a little bit
100:18 - of background knowledge about this
100:20 - two-dimensional space itself of the
100:22 - canvas we need to think about something
100:24 - called a Cartesian coordinate system so
100:29 - a Cartesian coordinate system named for
100:32 - the French mathematician Rene Descartes
100:34 - Cartesian is a way of describing a
100:38 - two-dimensional space and saying like
100:39 - this spot can be identified by this
100:42 - quote-unquote
100:43 - XY position or this horizontal and
100:46 - vertical position you if you've taken
100:48 - some type of math or geometry class for
100:50 - ten depending on where you are are
100:52 - you're sort of learning the worlds of
100:54 - journey you might have seen a graph that
100:57 - looks like this with some ticks on it up
101:00 - and down and you might have learned like
101:03 - oh this is something called the x axis
101:06 - and this is something called the y axis
101:08 - and if I say here's a point three comma
101:12 - four I go this it and this is somehow
101:15 - the point 0 0 the origin the centre 3
101:19 - comma 4 would be 1 2 3 go up and then 1
101:24 - 2 3 4 refers to this position right here
101:28 - within the Cartesian coordinate system a
101:31 - 2d canvas being drawn by p5 is also a
101:35 - Cartesian coordinate system but it's a
101:38 - little bit confusing because
101:39 - this default the standard way accorded
101:42 - system in with pixels and computer
101:44 - graphics define does not look exactly
101:46 - like this the equivalent of this zero
101:49 - zero being the origin is actually up
101:52 - here at the top left and this is the
101:56 - x-axis horizontal this is the y-axis so
102:01 - if I were to say three comma four and
102:04 - try to find that pixel I would have to
102:07 - go one two three pixels over and one two
102:10 - three four pixels down three comma four
102:12 - would be this pixel right here the truth
102:15 - of the matter is are really really tiny
102:17 - right this is very similar to a piece of
102:19 - graph paper and that might be a way of
102:21 - kind of like playing you know you could
102:22 - stop and go get a piece of graph paper
102:23 - and try to like you know draw a big
102:26 - canvas on it and try to position where
102:28 - things are that's the idea of what we're
102:31 - doing here the pixels are really tiny so
102:33 - in many ways so so so if you have two
102:37 - more imagine like this is 0 this is
102:38 - pixel 0 and the width is 400 and this is
102:43 - gonna this is gonna make you a little
102:44 - bit crazy
102:45 - the last pixel is actually pixel 399
102:48 - well that's so weird think about that
102:50 - though and a little bit off on a tangent
102:52 - here that's not but it's kind of it
102:54 - comes up again and again let's say it's
102:57 - five pixels wide there are five pixels
103:00 - but the first pixel is 0 0 1 2 3 4 5
103:06 - fingers but I only got up to 4 so I this
103:09 - is like foreshadowing this is gonna come
103:10 - up but again again counting from 0 is a
103:13 - thing that we do a lot in programming
103:14 - which is a little bit different because
103:16 - like 1 2 3 4 5 but there 5 things but
103:18 - there's 0 1 2 3 4 all right so pixel 0
103:21 - pixel 399 so what does this mean 150
103:25 - this is the X location of the rectangle
103:28 - and 50 is the Y location of the
103:30 - rectangle so let's just guess maybe one
103:33 - of a pixel 100 is about over here
103:35 - pixel 50 is about over here so that's
103:38 - this pixel here that's 150 this is the
103:43 - width of the rectangle and this is the
103:47 - height of the rectangle 1 even that's
103:50 - about 25 pixels
103:51 - maybe that's about 75 pixels
103:53 - so that is how we define the rectangle
103:56 - the first two arguments are the XY of
103:59 - the top left the third argument is the
104:01 - width and the last argument there is the
104:04 - height and there we see the rectangle I
104:07 - clearly didn't draw this perfectly but
104:09 - if we come back here we can see that's
104:11 - exactly what you see right here and I
104:14 - could start changing these numbers
104:15 - around and I could say 150 and I could
104:20 - say 75 and I can move it over to 175 and
104:25 - it's gonna be over there and I can move
104:26 - it up to zero and it's going to be there
104:28 - so you can see this is what you can play
104:30 - around with now changing those numbers I
104:32 - gotta I gotta get something off my chest
104:34 - what we're doing here seems telling this
104:37 - is what programming is are you crazy it
104:39 - would be so much easier for me to do
104:41 - this in insert you know commercial
104:43 - software that makes images or drawings
104:44 - here but I don't want to bus market for
104:47 - free anyway that the answer is true
104:52 - this is only just the way I want to
104:54 - start the whole point of programming is
104:56 - to write algorithms and instructions for
104:59 - saying things like spin around move up
105:01 - and down bounce off the edge how could I
105:03 - turn this into a puzzle game pong where
105:05 - that's actually the paddle that moves up
105:07 - and down we're gonna get I'm gonna get
105:08 - there but so this is a little bit of
105:11 - like not really how programming works
105:13 - but it's a good place to get started and
105:15 - feel comfortable and so basically you
105:17 - know what I'm Simon tis if you choose to
105:20 - accept this is to make your own drawing
105:23 - make your own drawing maybe make a
105:26 - drawing of somebody a friend of yours or
105:28 - someone in your family a little portrait
105:30 - of them are self portrait or do
105:32 - something abstract or draw a landscape
105:34 - or something that you know so I won't be
105:37 - on it so just try to make now make make
105:38 - a drawing and how are you gonna all I
105:41 - did was show you a rectangle I've been
105:43 - like talking for like two and a half
105:44 - hours I don't think I was this rectangle
105:47 - on the screen so how are you gonna do
105:48 - more than that I'm gonna leave you to it
105:51 - a little bit but but and let me show you
105:53 - how to how to get get get further so I'm
105:56 - gonna go back to the p51
105:59 - that's here for I'm gonna go to the p5
106:00 - reference and I'm gonna click on the
106:03 - rectangle function right this is where I
106:04 - am remember p5.js org slash reference
106:07 - I'm gonna click on the rectangle
106:09 - function and we're gonna say first we're
106:11 - going to see here's a nice little
106:12 - example so visit with the very least I
106:14 - could just take this and copy it shoot I
106:18 - have to go back here and I could copy it
106:20 - into my code and we could see okay
106:24 - that's what the exhibit is that look the
106:26 - same as what's here yeah kind of this is
106:28 - a smaller canvas but so right here oh
106:30 - look this there's like another argument
106:33 - and it's round and there's all the
106:34 - others so this is what you can explore
106:37 - but the point here is that what I want
106:38 - to look at is this is what's really
106:40 - important this is known as documentation
106:43 - this is saying this is the name of the
106:46 - function and these are the arguments X Y
106:49 - WH these are other arguments the reason
106:52 - they're why during their square brackets
106:53 - is they're optional so you you have to
106:56 - use an X Y width and height you can
106:58 - optionally add more arguments and here
107:00 - it's going to tell you what they are X
107:02 - is the x coordinate of the rectangle
107:04 - that's exactly what I explained to you
107:06 - over here Y is the y coordinate W is the
107:11 - width H is the height and then there's
107:13 - these other optional ones for rounding
107:15 - the edges and I'm gonna I'm not worried
107:18 - about that too much rectangle is maybe
107:20 - not the best one to start with because
107:21 - extra added complication but I could
107:23 - easily just go over and now click on say
107:25 - line and I can see oh look at this this
107:28 - is what it looks like the function name
107:32 - is line it takes four arguments this is
107:35 - what I get what are those arguments x1
107:38 - y1 x2 y2 x is the x coordinate of the
107:42 - first point why like why is y1 is the y
107:45 - coordinate the first point oh yeah a
107:46 - line is the thing that connects two
107:50 - points look at that I've connected two
107:53 - points with a line so now I can come
107:56 - back here and by the way oh my god Z I
107:59 - could get into 3d let's not get into 3d
108:01 - right now we'll save that for another
108:02 - time so I'm gonna go back to the editor
108:06 - and I'm gonna say something like line
108:09 - zero zero 400
108:13 - there we go look at that there's a line
108:16 - oh and maybe I want it to be 403 under
108:18 - because I wanted to go to the other side
108:19 - or I wanted to actually be like 0:50
108:22 - there's the line right you can see now
108:25 - that line is appearing it is a line that
108:27 - connects two points zero comma 50 and
108:29 - 400 comma 300 now okay something is
108:33 - really bothering me about the code don't
108:36 - be like me don't be much more forgiving
108:40 - and relaxed about the world but I cannot
108:42 - tolerate the fact that this line of code
108:45 - right here is starting over here and
108:48 - this one is starting a little bit over
108:49 - here code in I'm kind of joking around
108:52 - and look there's a space here but
108:54 - there's like no space after this comma
108:56 - one thing that you'll that is important
109:00 - to note is this is going to work no
109:03 - matter what if you if your code doesn't
109:06 - line up or you put a lot of spaces in or
109:09 - a few spaces in these types of things
109:12 - white space meaning space and return and
109:15 - tabs and all those those things do not
109:17 - affect the way the code runs but they do
109:19 - kind of make the code a little less
109:21 - readable and p5 has a really nice
109:23 - feature under edit tidy code which you
109:26 - can also do shift tab which will kind of
109:28 - fix the indentation and white space for
109:30 - you so I'm gonna press shift tab right
109:33 - now oh and everything is all lined up so
109:36 - I encourage you to use shift tab you
109:38 - know save after you've done that I
109:40 - didn't mention by the way that you can
109:42 - see when it's last been saved right up
109:44 - here it says just now that'll change
109:45 - into like a minute later and it also has
109:47 - autosave which you can adjust here in
109:52 - the settings autosave on and off that
109:54 - sort of important little feature just to
109:55 - quickly mention all right so we're
109:58 - almost almost ready to finish this video
110:00 - one thing one thing I got it sorry so
110:03 - first of all ah why is the background
110:06 - too pink
110:06 - and why is the rectangle white and the
110:08 - line is black well I haven't talked
110:10 - about color and also that's the topic of
110:12 - the next video we these are arguments
110:14 - that define the dimensions and the
110:17 - location of shapes but those arguments
110:19 - don't seem to define the color so we
110:20 - have to look at how do we define color
110:22 - the clue to that is somewhere in here
110:24 - right background the function must be
110:26 - the background color that's coming play
110:28 - around with that on your own if you want
110:29 - but that's what I'll talk about in the
110:30 - next video the other thing is look at
110:33 - this the line looks like it's going over
110:35 - this rectangle what happens if I take
110:39 - this line of code I'm going to use
110:40 - command X for cut and command V for
110:44 - paste now look at this zoom on in the
110:47 - line is behind the rectangle so layering
110:51 - the layering of the shapes what appears
110:53 - on top or behind has to do with the
110:56 - order of these lines of code the order
110:59 - that the code happens is is very
111:01 - important to how a program runs that's
111:04 - important right now just drawing some
111:05 - shapes playing around experimenting but
111:07 - this is a crucial concept that will come
111:09 - up especially once I want to animate
111:12 - this stuff so that's that's I'm that's
111:14 - gonna come how does this square move
111:16 - around how can I interact with the mouse
111:18 - and the order is gonna become even more
111:19 - important then okay so here's your
111:22 - assignment make your own picture use
111:28 - only don't listen to me and use whatever
111:31 - you want but if you want to constraint
111:33 - use only what's here under 2d primitives
111:37 - and yeah and maybe not arc or the play
111:43 - with arc and I'll have to make a video
111:44 - about arc or something and mmm let me
111:47 - kind of show you one more thing do I
111:48 - want to show you one more thing I think
111:50 - so I'm gonna be really useful so I got
111:52 - to show you one more thing where is this
111:54 - one okay attributes these are some other
111:57 - functions that you might be interested
111:59 - in exploring and I'm gonna come back to
112:02 - strokeweight for sure some of these as
112:04 - we talk to talk about color but at least
112:06 - one rect mode and ellipse mode are kind
112:08 - of important so I'm gonna just show you
112:11 - something about rex mode which is that
112:15 - remember how I said that this XY defines
112:20 - the top left location of the rectangle
112:24 - sometimes it's much more convenient to
112:27 - draw where a square rectangle is by
112:30 - setting the center of it and so that can
112:34 - also be done let me show you what I mean
112:36 - by that for example the center of the
112:39 - canvas right what's the center of the
112:41 - canvas if it's 400 wide and 300 high the
112:44 - center is 200 by 150 right so I'm gonna
112:49 - put this rectangle at 200 150 and then
112:53 - I'm going to make it 150 wide and 150
112:56 - high huh that's weird
112:58 - oh it's not in the center oh but the top
113:01 - left is in the center but what if I want
113:03 - the rectangle itself to be centered well
113:06 - I could figure out the math for that I
113:07 - go okay so then it's like 125 maybe it's
113:11 - like that's shifting it over but I can
113:13 - use an attribute sorry and the attribute
113:18 - rect mode is another function I can type
113:21 - Center in here this is an instruction a
113:24 - function to set the mode of drawing a
113:26 - rectangle to Center which means now look
113:29 - at it there it is in the center okay so
113:33 - that was another important so maybe in
113:35 - your exercise you might want to use rec
113:37 - mode in ellipse mode as well we could
113:39 - click on this and we could see look
113:41 - there's corner there's corners there's
113:43 - radius they're Center so there's a few
113:45 - other ways of defining how rectangle is
113:47 - but I think for the most part you're
113:49 - just gonna want the default way which is
113:51 - corner or Center which is Center okay
113:55 - you know when I said I was gonna do
113:58 - these videos I sort of imagined doing a
113:59 - whole bunch of like two or three minute
114:01 - ones I've completely failed at this this
114:03 - has became kind of a long one about
114:05 - drawing but hopefully you've got the
114:06 - basic idea and I look forward to seeing
114:09 - what you make you can share links to the
114:12 - p5 sketches you create after watching
114:14 - this video in the comments so I'll click
114:17 - on them and look at them and that'll be
114:18 - exciting
114:18 - okay thanks for watching and see you in
114:20 - the next video where I'll talk about
114:21 - color alright how are we doing everybody
114:36 - I'm feel like I'm actually okay on time
114:39 - at 6:30 we just guess I've been live
114:41 - streaming for about two hours and three
114:43 - hours is my r2 limit but I think I can
114:46 - do about a bunch more things all right
115:02 - you know somebody I can't remember who
115:04 - somebody on Twitter maybe sent me all
115:06 - this like really useful feedback look
115:09 - this up and I forgot to look at it right
115:12 - before I started whoops and the camera
115:18 - went off that's good so that wasn't more
115:20 - than half an hour
115:28 - I've seen the chat I don't know how far
115:33 - I'm gonna get today people are asking
115:37 - questions are you playing to do the
115:39 - whole tutorial today I don't know what
115:40 - counts there's the whole tutorial I'm
115:41 - gonna do the color one today then I
115:42 - think I'm done I don't know how many of
115:45 - the other ones all redo line is off the
115:50 - canvas there is no column 400 right okay
116:19 - okay
116:28 - um sorry I got distracted I I was like
116:33 - trying to find somebody's tweets sort of
116:36 - looking at Twitter way too much stuff
116:38 - going on I'll be back
116:40 - let me just see if I can find it because
116:42 - there was like really good feedback in
116:43 - there and I'm toy look again at the
116:45 - wrong time
116:50 - link to corresponding original videos in
116:53 - the details okay
116:54 - updated with es6 notation so that's good
116:57 - because I'm not worrying about that yet
116:58 - oh all right so these are these are good
117:02 - feedback but it's actually not
117:03 - necessarily related to what I'm doing
117:07 - right now so that's okay okay so anybody
117:16 - who was watching this who's like
117:17 - actually a total beginner anybody out
117:19 - there a total beginner watching this
117:20 - following trying this yourself running
117:23 - into anything okay Oh No press back who
117:33 - is in the slack channels asking do you
117:34 - mean my feedback from last stream no
117:37 - that feedback is also really good that
117:39 - was about the workflow setup stuff and I
117:41 - do want to look at that
117:44 - it was feedback about how I since I'm
117:46 - redoing some of my older beginning
117:48 - videos things that I could do to make
117:50 - them better and the feedback there that
117:52 - I just found on Twitter was more about
117:53 - like the stuff that's later on so okay
118:00 - so now what I'm going to do is let's do
118:07 - the color thing
118:14 - [Music]
118:19 - all right by the way of that eye problem
118:22 - you know this I guess I am Who I am you
118:24 - are what you are but I do feel like that
118:27 - was way too long okay all right so let's
118:34 - let's talk about color let me cycle the
118:39 - cameras
118:57 - okay
119:07 - all right
119:11 - yeah we got well let me save this let me
119:20 - do duplicate encoding train color
119:43 - all right all right hi why is the
119:49 - background pink that is the question
119:51 - that I would like to answer in this
119:53 - video
119:53 - color color is the next thing you
119:56 - probably may have to watch the last
119:57 - video you hopefully made some beautiful
119:59 - interesting or not that's beautiful but
120:01 - you made your own drawing and you're
120:02 - proud of it I'm proud of you for making
120:03 - it now you want to add color you can
120:05 - looked ahead of how to do it and started
120:07 - adding color anyway but you didn't
120:09 - I'm gonna show you how to do that now
120:11 - before I do that I do want to mention
120:13 - some other kind of logistical things
120:15 - that I've kind of forgotten to mention
120:17 - so one thing is whenever I create a
120:19 - sketch with the p5 web editor I'm gonna
120:23 - put a link to that sketch in the video's
120:25 - description so you could go down to the
120:27 - video description and click on it and so
120:28 - if you go to the link to the sketch
120:31 - you're actually going to go to a page
120:32 - it's gonna look just like this it's kind
120:34 - of the same code if you hit play it's
120:36 - gonna have the same output now you might
120:38 - have different you might not have the
120:39 - the dark theme with high contrast turned
120:41 - on so your layout might look a little
120:43 - different but ultimately the code is
120:45 - going to be the same but when you you
120:47 - won't have a save option because you're
120:49 - looking at a project that's made that I
120:52 - made in my account that I've shared with
120:54 - you so let me bear with me for a second
120:59 - I'm gonna be right back so this is going
121:03 - to edit
121:11 - so I'm just gonna go to some other
121:14 - sketch of mine so many oh my goodness so
121:20 - many schedules sketches I want to find
121:22 - something really simple this so I'm back
121:34 - now this is a another sketch that I've
121:36 - made for another course and I'm gonna
121:37 - kind of get to all this stuff and how
121:39 - all this kind of stuff works but even
121:41 - now look at all this complicated code it
121:42 - kind of might make some sense to you
121:44 - right o-line you know about that ellipse
121:46 - you know about that what's this X&Y this
121:48 - is all stuff we're gonna get to but this
121:50 - is a sketch called oscillation by nature
121:53 - of code which is a different account so
121:56 - if I I can edit this code right I could
121:58 - say like line you know 100 and then oh
122:02 - it's doing something slightly different
122:03 - I'm not sure what exactly but I can't do
122:07 - I can't there's no save option where's
122:09 - the save option you're gonna want to go
122:11 - to file duplicate and suddenly you're
122:14 - gonna see that it says oscillation copy
122:16 - by the coding train and I could rename
122:18 - this and I could say oscillation demo
122:21 - for YouTube or something and I've
122:23 - renamed my sketch but this is how when
122:25 - you go to a sketch that I've made you
122:28 - will come to a page that says you know
122:30 - color example by coding train and you
122:33 - will then do file duplicate and start
122:35 - writing your own the truth of the matter
122:36 - is if I'm doing so simple you don't
122:38 - necessarily need to duplicate my code to
122:39 - keep doing it but that's an important
122:41 - piece as I go through future vision I
122:44 - want to mention that at the outset of
122:45 - this video okay I'm gonna leave I'm not
122:47 - gonna worry about that I'm gonna go away
122:48 - now we're back here color
122:50 - how does color work on the computer you
122:56 - know I should have thought of this
122:56 - before it started recording this video
122:58 - but here's here's what I'm gonna say it
123:01 - with three syllables are G B remember
123:06 - this RGB RGB R stands for red G stands
123:11 - for green B stands for blue the way that
123:15 - you create a digital color is by mixing
123:17 - some amount of red some amount of green
123:20 - and
123:20 - some amount of glue so that's that
123:23 - that's where I want to start but we have
123:24 - that's the concept how do I apply that
123:27 - concept to function names and arguments
123:31 - of those functions well actually guess
123:33 - what we have done that already in here
123:37 - there is a function that is talking
123:39 - about color background is a function
123:42 - that draws a solid color over the entire
123:45 - background of the canvas and there is
123:47 - somehow 220 sprinkles of red 0 sprinkles
123:53 - of green right RGB those are the
123:55 - arguments and 200 sprinkles of blue and
123:59 - when you sprinkle that amount of red and
124:01 - that amount of blue you get this pink
124:03 - but let's just go with this what if we
124:05 - take out all the blue you can see that's
124:07 - pretty red what if I take out all of the
124:10 - red now it's black what if I just put
124:13 - some like really big numbers in here
124:14 - like just guess like a thousand look at
124:18 - that now we've got white to all the
124:19 - colors all mixed together make white
124:21 - that's weird right because if you like
124:23 - worked with paint and you were to mix
124:26 - all the color all like a whole lot of
124:27 - paint together you get this like brown
124:28 - muddy color get darker and darker this
124:31 - is the way that the color mixing is
124:33 - working here it's like mixing light so
124:36 - it's more than that the analogy here is
124:39 - I have a red flashlight a green
124:41 - flashlight and a blue flashlight and if
124:43 - I shine all those flashlights together
124:45 - in the same spot they mix together it's
124:47 - additive color the more we add up all
124:49 - those colors the brighter and brighter
124:50 - it gets but actually this is kind of
124:53 - wrong the fact that I'm putting a
124:55 - thousand in here so the idea here is
124:57 - we're sprinkling a certain amount of red
125:00 - and a certain amount of green and a
125:01 - certain amount of blue by the way there
125:03 - are other ways to set color I'll get to
125:05 - that this is not the only way some of
125:07 - you watching it like what about I heard
125:08 - something about HSB color and well
125:10 - there's all sorts of other ways to do it
125:12 - but this is the fundamental basic way
125:14 - the amount that I want that I can
125:17 - sprinkle has a range none no red none
125:21 - more red is zero the maximum amount of
125:25 - red is 255 by the way how many numbers
125:29 - are there between 0 and 255 if you keep
125:32 - the 0 0 1 2 3 4 it's too
125:34 - thirty-six again we're back to this
125:36 - weird counting from zero thing so
125:37 - there's a 256 possibilities 0 through
125:40 - 255 so now we can go back and we can
125:42 - kind of see let's come back to this and
125:45 - see all right 0 let's go back to 0 0 0
125:50 - let's do 200 let's do 255 we can see
125:53 - that it's blue let's do 100,000 it's the
125:57 - same blue so p5 is kind of smart enough
126:00 - to know when you call the background
126:01 - function if you by accident put a number
126:03 - in there that's bigger than 255 just
126:05 - consider it 255 now you can customize
126:08 - those ranges for yourself and there's
126:10 - reasons why you might want to do that
126:11 - again I'm going to come back to that you
126:13 - could look up the function colormode for
126:15 - how to do that but let's just stay with
126:17 - the default a red a green and a blue so
126:21 - I'm not the I'm not really very talented
126:23 - visual design wise so I'm not going to
126:26 - talk to you about how to pick beautiful
126:27 - colors that work well together yeah I
126:30 - hopefully you can find you you're gonna
126:32 - have that talent yourself I bet or you
126:34 - might find some other resources but this
126:36 - is how it works
126:36 - our GB one thing you might notice is did
126:40 - you notice how when they were all 0 it
126:44 - was black and when they were all 255
126:45 - those white what happens if I make them
126:47 - all like 100 it's like this gray color
126:51 - when R equals G equals B when the red
126:55 - green and blue values are all equal this
126:58 - is something known as greyscale color
127:00 - greyscale color is a color it's with
127:03 - notes it's the saturation is a term
127:05 - that's D saturated it's a color but it's
127:07 - gray 0 through 255 0 being black 255 in
127:12 - white for shorthand all of the color
127:15 - functions and there's more of them allow
127:17 - you to if you want to do a grayscale
127:19 - function you can skip having all three
127:22 - and you can just use one so if you put
127:24 - one argument in the background function
127:26 - you're assuming a grayscale color let's
127:28 - make note of this because there are a
127:34 - lot of different ways so let's assume
127:36 - that there's some type of color function
127:40 - right background being the one that we
127:43 - know right now if it has one argument
127:46 - this
127:48 - is grayscale if it has three arguments
127:54 - this is RGB and you can make a gray
127:57 - color with the RGB being equal but this
128:00 - is the way that you can call any color
128:02 - function now what other color functions
128:04 - are there let's go to the p5 reference I
128:07 - don't know why I don't have that open
128:09 - anymore let's look for color oh look oh
128:13 - so many things so many things said
128:14 - exciting ah so we want there's a lot of
128:17 - stuff about creating and reading color
128:18 - and I'm definitely gonna come back to
128:20 - that stuff this is really what we care
128:22 - about set in color so these are now you
128:24 - want to write make your new sketch your
128:27 - next assignment is to use any and all of
128:30 - these stroke no stroke no Phil Phil
128:32 - maybe color mode clear huh background so
128:36 - background we know about oops I clicked
128:39 - on it by accident but that's nice we're
128:40 - looking at the reference but we don't
128:43 - fill and Stroke are the next concepts
128:46 - that I want to talk about so let's say
128:49 - we have so what are the color function
128:56 - so color functions could be background
129:01 - that's one here's another one Phil
129:04 - here's another one stroke if this is our
129:09 - canvas and the shape we chose to draw is
129:12 - an ellipse with the ellipse function
129:15 - phil describes the interior of that
129:19 - shape stroke describes the outline the
129:26 - outline of that shape so let me show you
129:29 - what i mean by that
129:33 - so if i come by come back to the editor
129:38 - and i'm gonna get rid of the line and
129:41 - i'm just a with just this rectangle
129:42 - leave background at 100 what I'm gonna
129:45 - do is right before I draw the rectangle
129:47 - I'm gonna say fill and I'm gonna say 0 0
129:51 - 255 look I should show you about the
129:54 - console in errors I can't believe I'm
129:55 - showing you about that yes right look at
129:57 - this it's blue the interior of that
130:00 - shape is blue
130:01 - now I'm gonna say what's the outline
130:04 - it's black so by the way the default
130:06 - fill in p5 is white and the default
130:09 - stroke outline is black but I could now
130:12 - say stroke 0 255 0 and I'm already
130:16 - driving myself crazy with my
130:17 - inconsistent whites mates that we can
130:18 - zoom in and see the outline is now a
130:20 - green color so the interior the fill is
130:23 - blue the outline is green what if I were
130:27 - to do another shape like an ellipse and
130:31 - put that at like 50 50 175 oh look it's
130:39 - also green on the outside and blue on
130:44 - the inside Oh what if I want that
130:46 - ellipse to be a different color Oh what
130:51 - if I put like down here fill 0 255 0
130:56 - well it didn't work why didn't that work
130:59 - I'm saying Phil green not ellipse
131:01 - well order order remember order the
131:04 - ellipse
131:04 - let's move the ellipse over you see how
131:09 - the ellipse is on top of the rectangle
131:11 - it's because it's drawn after it but you
131:16 - need to set the color of what you're
131:18 - about to draw notice how fill and Stroke
131:20 - are right before the rectangle well
131:22 - that's set to blue that's set to green
131:25 - the ellipse is still picking up that
131:27 - fill and Stroke it's going to be this
131:28 - like it's like you're saying hey
131:30 - computer thing that's drawing the stuff
131:32 - pick up this pen and I told it to pick
131:35 - up this green pen for the interior I
131:38 - meant to make it red but I told it after
131:40 - it already drew the ellipse so let's
131:42 - make this red because that's what I
131:44 - wanted to demonstrate but if I go and I
131:46 - take this and I put it before it
131:47 - suddenly it's red so look at that so I
131:51 - kind of want to group things I could add
131:53 - some the idea here is I can I can make a
131:55 - stroke that's like 255 so that's just
131:57 - using grayscale color so you can see
132:01 - like ah the interior here is blue the
132:04 - outline is green the interiors red the
132:06 - outline is white there we go
132:10 - you probably have a lot of questions ask
132:13 - them in the comments there's a few more
132:14 - things I need to come
132:15 - this video why why why why when we
132:20 - looked over here in the reference is
132:21 - there a no fill-in no stroke and by the
132:24 - way I encourage you to go and look at
132:25 - these reference pages and read them
132:27 - because you'll find the things that I'm
132:28 - explaining to you are explained there
132:30 - and probably more clearly and it also
132:32 - has examples
132:33 - why is there no fill-in no stroke well
132:35 - you might think to yourself oh what if I
132:38 - don't want this circle to have an
132:40 - outline no outline of that circle please
132:42 - oh I'll just put 0 in here write 0 must
132:45 - be like no outline but remember 0 is not
132:48 - no outline 0 is an outline that is black
132:51 - and this is why instead of stroke if I
132:55 - say no stroke then suddenly there's no
133:01 - outline so no stroke means no outline
133:04 - and I could say also instead of Phil no
133:08 - Phil means no Phil look at that so I'm
133:12 - just seeing the background color come
133:14 - through because I'm only drawing the
133:16 - outline of that shape now I'm gonna go
133:18 - back and put the fill in what's and I
133:22 - realize there's a few other things I
133:23 - want to talk about ok so remember I said
133:28 - there were lots of ways guess what
133:30 - there's another way I could have 1 2 3 4
133:35 - I could have 4 the fourth argument is
133:40 - and I so RGB is not the whole picture
133:44 - there is also our GBA and a stands for
133:49 - something called alpha ok alpha I feel
133:55 - like I should I wonder if I should
133:55 - divide these videos up to shorter chunks
134:00 - yeah I mean it kind of want to like coz
134:05 - alpha could be its own video I'm gonna
134:08 - leave it long for now that's just the
134:11 - way I'm doing it today think back and
134:13 - redo nice ok yeah alpha a which stands
134:18 - for alpha alpha is a word for
134:20 - transparency meaning is the color
134:24 - see-through what does daddy
134:27 - mean right transparency so by the way
134:29 - the same range right 0 to 255 for the a
134:34 - 255 is the default meaning that color is
134:38 - just all aver it's another word by the
134:41 - way is opacity so this idea of kind of
134:44 - making the color a little bit
134:45 - transparent so it starts to blend with
134:47 - what's behind it now of course this is
134:49 - all about just creating the illusion of
134:51 - that 30 there's no blending of the
134:52 - colors nobody painting your computer
134:53 - screen it's just a single pixel with a
134:55 - certain color but p5 knows that if you
134:58 - want it to appear transparent it knows
135:00 - what colors behind it can figure out how
135:01 - to make that illusion happen so for
135:03 - example if we come over here for this
135:06 - ellipse right this ellipse that's red
135:09 - what if I were to add if I were to say
135:11 - comma 255 here nothing has changed I'm
135:14 - adding that alpha value if I put 0 there
135:17 - it's gone if it's fully transparent I
135:21 - can't see it at all if I make this 100
135:24 - look at that you can see how it sort of
135:26 - looks light and it's blending with the
135:28 - background and blending there so maybe I
135:30 - want to just give it a little bit more
135:32 - 175 and you can start to see that there
135:34 - so this is something you can play with
135:36 - transparency so just to finish this
135:39 - whole thing off
135:40 - I can have one argument for anything
135:43 - background fill and Stroke is a
135:45 - grayscale color 0 to 255 3 arguments is
135:48 - an RGB color with 100% opacity it is
135:52 - fully opaque it is not at all
135:54 - transparent if I add the fourth argument
135:57 - I get an RGB color with some amount of
136:00 - transparency and by the way if I just do
136:03 - just a little bit of an aside here if I
136:04 - just use two numbers then I'm having
136:06 - greyscale with some alpha so it's a
136:09 - grayscale value with some alpha so
136:11 - that's important to know as well so
136:13 - those are all of the options let me see
136:20 - what have I missed here okay clear
136:23 - background let's not worry about that's
136:25 - much more important when we clear is
136:28 - important when we come to Anna
136:29 - so I'll come and look at what clear does
136:31 - once I'm doing some animation stuff but
136:34 - color mode is kind of interesting I
136:36 - should probably do a whole separate
136:38 - video about that I encourage you to
136:39 - click on it and look through some of the
136:42 - documentation for what you can do with
136:44 - color mode but basically color mode
136:46 - allows you to change the way that you're
136:48 - describing color with an alternate
136:50 - format well I don't want to set the RGB
136:53 - in value maybe I want to set something
136:54 - called a hue or a saturation or a
136:56 - brightness I'll make her trying to make
136:58 - a video about what HSB color is maybe I
137:00 - have one already and which gets all
137:01 - linked to it and then it color mode also
137:04 - allows you to say like what if I want
137:05 - the range to be between 0 and 100 it's
137:08 - easier for my mind to think about that
137:10 - but I don't think you necessarily need
137:11 - to use color mode right now but I'm
137:13 - letting you do
137:15 - ok so now what is your assignment if
137:20 - you're watching this and you're gonna
137:21 - make something take your drawing and
137:23 - give it clerk fill it with color set the
137:27 - background set the set to fill and
137:30 - Stroke of different shapes I want to
137:32 - give you just one more we give you one
137:34 - more little treat here if I add a
137:37 - function called stroke weight this is a
137:41 - function that's not setting the color
137:42 - but you know I'm trying to show you that
137:44 - the outline of this let me make the
137:48 - outline of this is like red and I've
137:51 - kind of like I can't even see it
137:52 - that's weird we make it blue
137:55 - oh you know why because I put this I'm
137:58 - so much more to show you that the
138:01 - outline is blue but I have to like zoom
138:03 - all the way in to show it to you what if
138:06 - I add this thing called stroke wait I
138:08 - just put the number 1 in there well what
138:11 - that number 1 means is the outline of
138:13 - the shape is 1 pixel wide it's a thin 1
138:17 - pixel wide outline I could make that 8
138:21 - and suddenly it's much thicker so and
138:25 - you know I can zoom in just to show this
138:27 - to you
138:27 - I could be sort of insane and make this
138:29 - like 24 or 105 you know it's only like
138:33 - the stroke is like wider than the actual
138:35 - shape itself but the point is just to be
138:37 - able to if you want to adjust the width
138:39 - of
138:40 - outline that's something you can do with
138:42 - these strokeweight function
138:44 - thanks I so what I want to do is show
138:47 - you something about code comments and
138:49 - errors this is really important I've
138:51 - kind of been skipping over that I'm
138:52 - gonna do that I'm gonna make a video
138:53 - really about that separately in with
138:56 - with the people I'm just web editor and
138:57 - that will be coming next okay so it so
139:00 - that's something it's gonna you probably
139:01 - watch that before you do your project or
139:03 - afterwards whatever but that's gonna
139:05 - help you a little bit just kind of
139:06 - keeping things organized and managed
139:07 - okay so I'll see you soon yeah
139:25 - was there a sound problem there so I
139:50 - oh yeah
140:05 - no sound bromo how long is the stream
140:08 - going to last I am a baby at another
140:15 - hour at the most
140:18 - I'm not sure oh building is
140:20 - probably completely closed the only
140:22 - person left all right
140:26 - it was very subtle didn't notice it okay
140:27 - so great so I'm gonna assume that's fine
140:30 - oh all right
140:32 - so I need to do something about comments
140:35 - and okay all right everybody
141:08 - all right all right I have to do one I
141:15 - really need to do this comments and
141:17 - errors hi so I have so far made three
141:29 - videos in this series about learning to
141:31 - code from the very beginning with P 5
141:33 - and the P 5 web editor and I kind of
141:36 - have been avoiding showing you what
141:38 - happens when you make a mistake which I
141:39 - really should not have done that's the
141:41 - thing I really should be showing you
141:42 - right for the beginning but I didn't and
141:44 - I also haven't mentioned to you
141:46 - something called code comments and both
141:49 - of these things are fundamental to how
141:51 - you might create a p5 sketch one that
141:54 - you might work on or a period time and
141:55 - return to later so let's first look at
141:58 - the console and errors so there's this
142:00 - whole extra section down here that I've
142:03 - ignored I've been talking about this is
142:05 - where you write your code the play
142:07 - button execute the code and this is
142:10 - where you see the result of your code
142:11 - well what do you see down here what you
142:14 - see down here is messages that are
142:16 - things that are related to what's
142:18 - happening in your code that might be a
142:20 - mistake or something that you add you
142:23 - want to specifically put a message there
142:24 - so I'm going to show you there's a
142:25 - function called print I'm gonna say
142:29 - print and I'm gonna say hello and I'm
142:31 - putting this in setup because I want
142:33 - this just to happen at the beginning and
142:34 - this again I will come back to later so
142:36 - this being in the code suddenly in the
142:39 - console we have this down here the idea
142:42 - the console is not something so if
142:44 - you're making a project that you imagine
142:46 - users using like a game you wouldn't put
142:49 - the score of the game here you would
142:51 - want to draw the score somewhere on the
142:54 - canvas or there's actually a way you
142:55 - could put the score below the canvas
142:56 - something for the user to ultimately see
142:58 - but if you just want to be able to see
143:01 - what the score of the game is and kind
143:03 - of like for yourself while you're
143:04 - developing the console is for you the
143:06 - person who's writing the code or your
143:08 - friend who you're sharing the code with
143:10 - or your teacher or whoever I mean it's
143:12 - something that anybody using the p5 web
143:14 - editor can see but when you finished it
143:16 - and you
143:16 - on your own website which is maybe
143:18 - something I'll show you how to do that
143:19 - console wouldn't necessarily appear so
143:22 - in addition to be able to put your own
143:24 - messages anything that you do wrong is
143:26 - going to be down there now
143:28 - one thing that's really important notice
143:30 - how no stroke has a capital S look no
143:33 - stroke also doesn't even have any
143:36 - arguments in here like it's just open
143:38 - and closed parentheses because there's
143:39 - no way to modify it that's something I
143:40 - didn't mention notice how there's commas
143:44 - here if I could get anything wrong like
143:46 - if I delete this comma look at this
143:49 - now I'm also getting error messages in
143:52 - here now this is it won't go I don't
143:56 - even hear that sound did that did it
143:58 - just buzz buzz look error message so
144:11 - here's the thing whenever you see the
144:14 - red error message
144:15 - first of all just take a deep breath
144:17 - sometimes the error message is lovely
144:20 - it's like tells you exactly what's wrong
144:22 - and you can and it tells you how to fix
144:23 - it and this might be a case on caught
144:25 - six syntax error missing parentheses
144:27 - after your argument list sketch line
144:30 - eleven oh look line eleven missing
144:33 - frenzies sorry you know what it really
144:35 - should say missing comma so this is the
144:37 - thing the thing that's generating the
144:40 - error the web editor of the JavaScript
144:43 - language the browser all of these pieces
144:45 - are figuring out what to put down there
144:47 - it doesn't always guess correctly so we
144:50 - the next thing is I can see like
144:52 - unexpected a parenthesis we could kind
144:54 - of like see it there but we're gonna
144:56 - have to guess what's wrong it's actually
144:57 - a comma sometimes you'll get an error
144:59 - the message that totally makes sense I'm
145:02 - gonna change this from stroke weight
145:04 - with a capital W to stroke weight with a
145:07 - lowercase W and this I'm not getting
145:11 - such a great error message but this is a
145:12 - really important one uncaught reference
145:14 - error stroke weight is not defined
145:17 - well but why is it not defined I watched
145:20 - a video from Daniel Schiffman and he
145:23 - said that stroke weight is a function
145:24 - from the p5.js library it's not part of
145:26 - the JavaScript language but it's a
145:27 - function of the p5.js library and I
145:28 - could call it in my code
145:29 - if I'm using the PAI just way better we
145:31 - just drew but because programming is in
145:35 - JavaScript is case-sensitive it doesn't
145:37 - know what it is without the capital W
145:39 - and notice how the editor is syntax
145:41 - highlighting it for you
145:43 - so strokeweight suddenly it turns blue
145:45 - this is by the way no different than me
145:47 - saying like oh I want to write a
145:48 - function called unicorn magic o uncaught
145:52 - reference error unicorn magic is not
145:54 - defined because it's not a functions not
145:57 - part of the p5.js library or any other
145:59 - library that i might be choosing to use
146:00 - as part of my project there are other
146:02 - functions that you can call by the way
146:04 - that are just part of JavaScript
146:06 - inherently that you get when you use
146:07 - javascript and p5 adds functions to that
146:10 - so that's an error you're gonna see a
146:12 - lot it's it's because you've misspelled
146:14 - it maybe you got a capital wrong or it's
146:17 - just something you thought was in p5 or
146:19 - some other library using but it's not
146:20 - there at all so here's an interesting
146:23 - thing I'm going to just take out all the
146:25 - semicolons or like some of them no error
146:29 - message I'm having like heart
146:31 - palpitations right now because the
146:33 - semicolons give me comfort but the truth
146:35 - of the matter is the semicolons are
146:37 - somewhat optional in JavaScript they
146:40 - indicate where the end of the line is
146:42 - the end of the line of code background
146:45 - 100 is where is it it's there but
146:51 - JavaScript can usually figure out where
146:54 - the end of line of code is even if you
146:56 - don't include this the semicolon the
146:57 - weird things I'm going to show you
146:58 - something kind of interesting if I were
147:03 - to put let's say rect mode up here on
147:05 - the same line the code runs just fine
147:08 - the same way JavaScript actually thinks
147:11 - of that as two lines of code because
147:13 - semicolon me at the end of the line
147:15 - then the next line but if I delete the
147:16 - semicolon now all this lost it can't
147:19 - figure it out so this is why it's
147:21 - generally good practice to use the
147:22 - semicolons it's like a safety net like
147:24 - I'm really explicitly saying where the
147:26 - end of the line of code is but you might
147:27 - you like really just you should have fun
147:29 - and just like not using colons but I
147:32 - can't help it and also I have to do the
147:34 - tidy code thing now there okay so that's
147:38 - errors on the console there's another
147:40 - thing I want to talk about in this video
147:41 - maybe I should make it another one I'm
147:43 - so confused about whether to make short
147:44 - ones or long ones but I'm going to talk
147:46 - about it right now
147:47 - no I'm gonna do it in the next one I
147:57 - wanna shock I think I should make these
148:00 - shorter I think it's better to make
148:01 - these shorter somebody's gonna tell me
148:06 - that wasn't that long
148:21 - people just talking about the buzz
148:23 - talking about the buzz shy should I do
148:25 - another image I should I keep going or
148:27 - make it the next video like if you were
148:29 - a student you're in high school you're
148:31 - watching these on YouTube would you
148:33 - rather have the longer ones are a bunch
148:34 - of shorter ones long no I mean I find as
148:39 - bits 20 minutes it's fine short and
148:43 - curly this is a very scientific way of
148:46 - pulling we just see you write something
148:49 - into the chat they see Kelly is typing
148:55 - and I feel like Kelly is going to say in
148:57 - flack something really meaningful and
148:59 - I'm waiting all right I'm gonna I'm
149:07 - gonna
149:13 - yeah about 50 miles shorter long yeah
149:19 - that's true CJ right shorter is better
149:21 - for searching finding what you need I
149:23 - think the comments is its own thing so
149:25 - I'm going to I'm gonna do that or I know
149:31 - I said at the beginning of this video
149:32 - that I was gonna talk about the code
149:34 - comments but I'm not going to that's
149:36 - gonna be in the next video and do that
149:37 - separately so you can look at them
149:39 - individually and this videos title
149:40 - should probably just say like console
149:42 - and error messages so you won't will
149:44 - turn up in your search alright so if you
149:47 - want to the next thing that I think is
149:49 - useful to you and like working on your
149:50 - assignment to your project for this
149:52 - first set of videos is understanding
149:54 - what code comments are and how to use
149:56 - them I'll do that in the next video okay
150:02 - here I am so in this video I'm gonna
150:05 - talk to you about code comments and how
150:07 - you can write comments in your code for
150:09 - just you are your friend and the human
150:11 - beings who are look at your code to read
150:13 - or actually to like quickly disable and
150:15 - re-enable certain lines of code all
150:17 - sorts of exciting things you can do with
150:18 - code comments I'll show you how to do
150:20 - that in the p5 web editor but this is a
150:22 - universal concept any programming
150:24 - language or environment that you choose
150:26 - to work in we will have a feature of a
150:28 - way of writing stuff in your code that
150:30 - is ignored by the computer that's
150:32 - executing the instructions and is just
150:34 - there for you to review if you like took
150:38 - a break for a for a year and you come
150:39 - back or to remind yourself with
150:40 - something so let's look at that so
150:42 - anything that I write into the p5 web
150:45 - editor with a slash slash immediately
150:50 - that line becomes what's known as a
150:52 - comment so let's like like what if I
150:54 - were to write something okay so this is
150:57 - the green rectangle in the center so the
151:01 - idea of a code comment and you can see
151:03 - that it is highlighted it is gray it
151:05 - does not have the syntax highlighting of
151:07 - the executed this means that when the
151:09 - computer is executing the instructions
151:11 - and I never explicitly said this but
151:13 - it's important line by line one after
151:16 - another it ignores this that is just
151:20 - there for me the human being to read so
151:22 - this can be useful if you were doing a
151:25 - self-portrait you might
151:26 - like this is where I'm worked on my nose
151:29 - and this is where this is the code for
151:30 - drawing my chin and this is the code for
151:32 - drawing my ears you don't even have to
151:35 - do it as a sentence oh I could just say
151:36 - like you know red red circle you might
151:41 - also write a note to yourself like later
151:42 - I want to make this circle animate and
151:45 - actually a convention of science right
151:47 - to do I mean that but you know that
151:49 - doesn't mean anything but so there's all
151:51 - sorts of things you could write in the
151:52 - code comments so I encourage you
151:55 - easier said than done and I don't
151:56 - necessarily follow my own advice but I
151:58 - encourage you to get in the habit of
152:00 - writing code comments your future self
152:02 - will thank you it's certainly something
152:04 - that as a teacher I try to do as much as
152:07 - possible because I want to explain the
152:09 - code in line so people can looking at it
152:11 - can follow what certain pieces are doing
152:13 - and typically I put the comment that's
152:15 - describing what's happening after it
152:17 - okay so that's how code comments work
152:20 - but there's another sort of neat trick
152:22 - to code comments that I'm not mentioning
152:24 - which is that if a code if a comment is
152:29 - the thing that's ignored why not use
152:32 - slash slash in front of something like a
152:35 - function call so I could for example do
152:39 - slash slash and suddenly the line of
152:43 - code with the rectangle function is
152:45 - grayed out and the rectangle is no
152:47 - longer in my canvas so this is a thing
152:51 - that I can do because before do you
152:53 - notice how when I wanted to demonstrate
152:54 - stroke wait so I have to pause for a
152:57 - second because I getting getting
153:02 - notifications on my watch that's really
153:05 - distracting me I'm gonna take it off I
153:06 - will look at these I think it's an
153:08 - important message but it's it's way too
153:11 - distracting my watch is buzzing me okay
153:21 - sorry about that this is gonna be
153:23 - awkward edit but I'm gonna coming I'm
153:26 - gonna sort of repeat what I was saying
153:28 - and it'll hopefully get spliced together
153:29 - in a way that makes sense before when I
153:33 - was showing you what if I wanted to use
153:35 - no stroke instead of stroke what I
153:37 - actually did was I deleted stroke and
153:40 - then wrote no stroke in there and I was
153:43 - able to sort of like undo my way back
153:45 - but often what I want to do and I'm
153:47 - gonna do that right now often what I
153:49 - want to do is say like I let me quickly
153:50 - disable the stroke and then show you no
153:53 - stroke so here I'm kind of saving what I
153:57 - had before because I may want to we
154:00 - enable it and then and adding in
154:03 - something new and then now if I want to
154:05 - put the stroke back I can delete that
154:07 - and I can delete the slash slash and now
154:10 - the stroke is back so and I can even do
154:13 - things like I can like highlight this
154:14 - whole section and I can say command
154:16 - slash and the whole thing is like
154:18 - commented out I can say command slash
154:20 - again and the whole thing comes back so
154:22 - this is a really just useful technique
154:24 - while you're working to kind of speed up
154:26 - your workflow you can kind of leave some
154:28 - stuff in your code that you don't want
154:29 - to see but you might want to pull back
154:30 - come back later and you'll sort of
154:33 - figure out how to manage this best but
154:34 - the primary reason for comments is to
154:38 - add things in your code about what
154:41 - you're doing and this could be for
154:43 - teaching or it can be notes to your
154:44 - future self and I might say that things
154:46 - that you might want to consider doing is
154:48 - you know code example by you know you
154:52 - know Daniel Shipman you can do things
154:54 - like this the coding train maybe you put
154:56 - like a URL in here like this is the kind
154:59 - of thing maybe you have some information
155:00 - like and it's what your license is like
155:03 - please share and use you know there's
155:07 - technically you can add a software
155:08 - license that's part of the comments and
155:10 - I don't want to get too far down that oh
155:12 - let just explain to people what they can
155:14 - use it for but this is the kind of thing
155:16 - that you can also use code comics for to
155:18 - put something at the top that's kind of
155:20 - announcing what it is credits and
155:22 - usually I would do things like this code
155:25 - is based on everything you know I
155:29 - learned from you know Lauren McCarthy
155:33 - and Cassie Tara Cajun creator of the
155:38 - editor you know I would really often
155:41 - like I'm always crediting where I got my
155:43 - name because so much about coding is
155:46 - finding examples and changing something
155:48 - in the example learning to code is doing
155:50 - that and so I always like to try to give
155:51 - credit you know sometimes a legal
155:53 - requiring because I give credit with p5
155:55 - everything is open-source and you and
155:57 - licensed in such a way to all the
155:59 - examples that you do are not required
156:01 - under any legal anything to give credit
156:04 - but it's nice to give credit when you
156:06 - can I always try to and if I forget - if
156:08 - you see something I made I forgot to
156:09 - give credit please let me know so I can
156:11 - have it okay okay there's some more
156:14 - stuff there's other fancier ways you can
156:16 - add comments but I'm gonna I'm not going
156:18 - to go into that right now I'm just
156:20 - noticing in the chat so well you know
156:21 - all in good time I can't get to
156:24 - everything in every video so that's code
156:26 - comments you are ready if you were if
156:28 - you were taking this somehow as a course
156:30 - this would kind of be the end of the
156:32 - first module you've learned about a
156:34 - little bit about what p5 is what
156:36 - JavaScript is how to sign up for an
156:38 - editor account how to draw shapes how to
156:41 - set colors and how to read error
156:44 - messages and add comments so make a
156:46 - sketch save it share it share it with me
156:49 - in the comments share it on Twitter
156:51 - let's talk about bet ways that we can
156:53 - share these things with each other and I
156:55 - look forward to seeing what you make and
156:58 - if you continue watching this series the
157:01 - next stuff that is to come is going to
157:03 - show you about how to animate the stuff
157:05 - and interact with it with the mouse okay
157:07 - I will see you soon
157:09 - and hope you enjoyed these videos
157:22 - everyone's doing they have to do the
157:24 - star slash slash star do I really have
157:28 - to it seems like a whole can of worms to
157:31 - open Oh been dug this how do we share in
157:42 - the comments we can't put in a link so
157:44 - you can put in a link if you put in a
157:47 - link it'll stop the youtube comment
157:49 - system will often flag it and it'll show
157:52 - up when I look at the channel moderation
157:54 - as like a possible spam comment I I will
157:57 - approve them if they're a link to the
157:58 - web editor so it just won't show up
158:01 - immediately I have to look at my
158:06 - messages now because it looked like
158:07 - there was something important so
158:09 - apologies
158:16 - oh okay
158:36 - sorry I just I'm a little bit later
158:39 - getting home and I thought coding train
158:43 - is brought to you by a very kind family
158:45 - who doesn't mind when I keep being later
158:47 - than I say that's what all that buzzing
158:51 - was so I think I've got to start
158:53 - wrapping up but but but I am going to
159:14 - I'm gonna do that snake game coding
159:17 - challenge alright
159:22 - oh I didn't duplicate this but that's
159:25 - fine I will work that out
159:27 - hold on I'm gonna do something a little
159:32 - bit weird here I mean I'm not too
159:38 - worried about keeping track of this code
159:39 - actually you know what I don't think
159:43 - I'll clean this stuff up later I'm not
159:46 - too worried about the alright hold on no
159:48 - no no let me let me let me do what I
159:50 - meant to do so I'm gonna back I don't
159:53 - know how long the undo is but I'm gonna
159:55 - back up to the end of the color video
159:57 - which i think is about this
159:58 - so that's coding train color then I'm
160:02 - gonna do file duplicate I don't think I
160:04 - need this but coding train comments
160:08 - console and I'm gonna say print hello
160:11 - here and I'm gonna hit save and
160:19 - hopefully that oh oh and then I'm gonna
160:22 - get this oh whoops
160:23 - let me get this
160:34 - just gonna have to finish this up
160:36 - and I'm gonna say print hello hope so
160:48 - this should be fine so later when I'm
160:50 - putting links
160:51 - into the video description I'm going to
160:59 - say file open yeah so I have coding
161:04 - train drawing coding train color
161:06 - oscillation demo encoding trade comments
161:08 - console so these will be the things that
161:10 - I'll link in the video description yes
161:14 - thank you Kelly I should do that now I
161:17 - can't do that though live broadcasting
161:19 - all right I'm gonna do my best
161:33 - now why that closed everything alright
161:35 - I'm a little bit concerned but let's
161:45 - so I am going to
162:00 - I I think for this coding challenge I am
162:05 - NOT going to flip the editor because I'm
162:08 - going to need to use this over here and
162:14 - so I'm just gonna try to see how it
162:18 - works like this and that's plenty of
162:21 - space for me so let's try this so I'm
162:25 - gonna say snake coding challenge so I'm
162:31 - gonna try to make the snake game again
162:33 - today is the day today is the day of
162:39 - just redoing everything I've done before
162:43 - so unfortunately I don't have time to do
162:46 - a video about using Google classroom and
162:50 - the p5.js web editor I've got to add
162:52 - that to my list and hopefully I can be
162:56 - done with this coding challenge in 20
162:58 - minutes
162:58 - Oh Austin says fix the sidebar in my new
163:03 - bookmarklet I'm a little concerned I'm
163:05 - just gonna try it like this is I'm a
163:07 - little bit concerned about people like
163:12 - seeing it all different but and also I
163:19 - just I'm pressed for time so thank you
163:21 - for that I'm gonna play around with that
163:22 - flippin thing in the future future video
163:26 - okay you know I actually don't have to
163:33 - do the thing I could do that other thing
163:36 - I need to do this weekend I could do it
163:37 - not in this studio so so let's see okay
163:46 - I am so not prepared for this and I'm
163:50 - totally exhausted I'm gonna be over here
163:54 - drinking my non branded water product
164:03 - we need to erase the whiteboard so you
164:07 - might need to use it
164:23 - okay here we go here's my attempt to
164:27 - make another video with a million views
164:29 - most of my videos look like five to ten
164:31 - thousand views that snake there you go
164:33 - look it up that snake game video it's
164:35 - always at the top of my analytics and
164:37 - just forever it don't know why but okay
164:44 - all right let me cycle the cameras
164:53 - hungry I haven't had dinner this is uh
164:55 - this is a recipe for disaster but I'm
164:58 - doing it anyway happy back-to-school in
165:03 - his August 31st school for me starts
165:06 - next week on the Kodi train I'm going to
165:09 - do have to do it classic again I'm going
165:13 - to attempt to do a coding challenge can
165:15 - pick the snake game and yes I have done
165:19 - this before but I'm I'm going to do this
165:20 - in order to celebrate something that was
165:22 - announced today the p5.js web editor so
165:28 - the p5 web Jazz official web editor is
165:30 - out and I'm gonna try to go nice thing
165:34 - about this is when I code this at the
165:36 - end of it stop the sound effects at the
165:40 - end of this you'll be able to just go
165:42 - directly to this URL which I'll include
165:44 - in the video description and hit
165:46 - duplicate you have to make an account
165:47 - for the web editor hit duplicate and and
165:51 - then make your own version of it from my
165:53 - code and sure that would be so I will
165:55 - include all about how to do that in the
165:57 - video description and I'm gonna give
165:59 - myself about Oh watch isn't on there's
166:01 - no timer but I actually have to go home
166:03 - very soon so I'm about 20 minutes which
166:06 - of course is gonna take longer than that
166:08 - but let's see how it goes alright so
166:10 - however long this video is is however
166:11 - long it takes
166:12 - hopefully there'll be no edits every
166:14 - once a while like you know it just has
166:15 - to be an edit cuz the whole system
166:16 - crashes
166:17 - I better get coding snake game have you
166:20 - ever played the snake game the idea of
166:22 - the snake game is there is a canvas you
166:26 - are a dot or like a little square on
166:29 - that canvas another doctor or another
166:31 - little square appears which is a piece
166:33 - of food
166:34 - you want to move you can only move to
166:35 - the right up or down along grab that
166:38 - piece of food once you grab that piece
166:39 - of food a new piece of food appears
166:41 - somewhere else and you get a little more
166:44 - on your tail you get another piece of
166:46 - your body and you get the next piece of
166:48 - food it gets longer it gets longer and
166:50 - anytime you hit the edge if you run into
166:52 - one of the edges you die the game's over
166:54 - or if you hit another part of your body
166:56 - and be honest about tartar as your body
166:57 - gets longer and longer that's the snake
166:59 - game that's what I'm gonna code so in
167:02 - order to do this I'm gonna use object
167:04 - oriented programming in my previous
167:05 - version of this coding challenge
167:06 - I used Lexus constructor function thing
167:09 - and now we have es6 classes I want like
167:12 - a happy sound so one thing I'm gonna do
167:14 - is I'm gonna show you by the way if you
167:15 - want to know all about the p5.js web
167:17 - editor check a link to a medium article
167:19 - that is in the video's description and a
167:21 - whole bunch of videos from the
167:22 - processing foundation there's a nice
167:24 - video with caste ter occasion created
167:26 - the editor describing all of its
167:27 - features but one feature is that I can
167:29 - go over here and find this little thing
167:32 - this little tick less than greater than
167:35 - two times whatever it is and I could say
167:36 - add file and I'm gonna add a file I'm
167:40 - gonna call it snake jf and now I have a
167:44 - file called snake doc is where I can
167:46 - create a snake class now if you've never
167:48 - done object-oriented programming before
167:50 - the idea is that this is a template for
167:53 - this snake object I'm gonna make in my
167:55 - code and has a constructor function I
167:56 - will refer you to my tutorials about
167:58 - program objects wearing with es6 classes
168:00 - now but in order for I need to actually
168:06 - go into index dot HTML so that the page
168:11 - when I run the code is actually using
168:13 - both sketch dot Jas and snake touch yes
168:16 - so that's there so now I have sketched a
168:18 - s which is just a oh and I need to see
168:21 - this a 400 by 400 canvas and a snake Jas
168:26 - which has nothing in it but what I'm
168:29 - gonna do is I'm gonna say let snake and
168:33 - in setup setup being where the code
168:35 - starts in a p5.js sketch snake equals
168:39 - new snake so I've made a new snake and
168:42 - what do I want to do I want to update
168:44 - the snakes location every frame
168:46 - and I want to display it so the idea
168:49 - here is I want to say snake dot update
168:51 - and I want to say snake show I'll use
168:56 - show as a meaning show yourself display
168:59 - what is this snake dot update is not a
169:02 - function
169:03 - oh come on I have to write the code for
169:05 - it yes I have to write the code for it
169:07 - so if I'm going to write a function
169:08 - called update that means I have to put a
169:10 - function in the snake class called
169:13 - update and then I have to put a function
169:14 - called show no I'm done coding challenge
169:17 - complete snake game not also this is
169:19 - like the skeleton of the code but I
169:21 - actually need to put stuff in here and
169:22 - I'm gonna hit shift tab to tidy up the
169:25 - indentation okay hmm what do I need so
169:28 - I'm gonna do something a little weird I
169:29 - know that what I need is an array
169:32 - because even though the snakes position
169:35 - you could think of as like a single X Y
169:37 - location
169:38 - I boxed this the last time I did this
169:41 - really what I want is an array because I
169:44 - want to keep track of a list of all of
169:45 - its locations and maybe the first
169:47 - element and probably more easily the
169:49 - last element of the array when there's
169:51 - only one thing is it's the sort of head
169:53 - of the snake the front part of the snake
169:55 - so I'm gonna do that I'm gonna say this
169:59 - time to call it a body is an array and
170:02 - then I'm gonna say this dot body index
170:06 - zero but one thing is is create vector
170:09 - now create vector is a function in p5
170:12 - that creates a vector object and that
170:14 - vector object has an x and a y so I'm
170:17 - going to create it at 0 0 and then in
170:21 - update I'm going to say this dot body
170:26 - index 0 dot X plus equal this dot X
170:30 - speed I'll call it X speed or X
170:32 - direction or something and this dot body
170:35 - dot wha is using that zero dot y equals
170:38 - this dot Y direction oh this is so ugly
170:40 - but it's the way I'm doing it right
170:42 - instead of having a this is a little
170:44 - weird like really if it's just like one
170:46 - thing that's moving around I just have
170:47 - an x and a y instead I have a body index
170:50 - 0 X and a body index 0 Y because later
170:53 - I'm gonna get to add more pieces to the
170:55 - body so if I run this what's this dot X
170:59 - direction
170:59 - style y direction it doesn't even exist
171:01 - so those are going to be variables that
171:03 - tell me is the snake moving to the right
171:05 - or left is the snake moving up and down
171:07 - so those values this dot X dir is I'll
171:13 - start them at zero so there's zero and
171:18 - so and then show I'm going to do
171:23 - something I'm going to say what do I
171:25 - want to do showing the snake is drawing
171:26 - a rectangle I'll do something a little
171:28 - bit weird so I'm gonna draw again
171:31 - eventually it's gonna become a loop
171:32 - because I'm gonna be drawing all the
171:34 - pieces of it but let's just start with
171:36 - putting in the x and a y and I'm just
171:39 - going to say I'm gonna make it ten this
171:41 - is gonna be a little weird actually
171:43 - ten by ten the rectangle and I'm sorry
171:45 - that you can't see all the code
171:47 - let me I'm not I'm not used to doing
171:49 - challenges with the web editor so let's
171:51 - see if I can make this a little bit
171:52 - wider there we go
171:56 - so okay rectangle and then I'm gonna say
172:00 - fill 0 just to make it black and look at
172:03 - that already I see there I better save
172:05 - this oh saved a minute ago it's
172:07 - auto-saving that's wonderful there it is
172:08 - right there let me make x-direction one
172:12 - uh whoops two equals by accident look
172:16 - it's moving now right because the idea
172:18 - update the bodies heads Y X location is
172:23 - increasing right if I made this 100 it's
172:26 - moving really really fast 10 it's moving
172:28 - pretty fast if I change this back to
172:29 - zero it make this one is moving down I
172:31 - could do all sorts of weird things make
172:33 - that five but that's now no longer in
172:34 - the snake game the snake game by
172:36 - definition I can only move horizontally
172:38 - or vertically so I'm going to start
172:41 - these at zero and then I'm also just
172:44 - right now I'm going to change this to
172:45 - one good I'm gonna explain me to do this
172:48 - in a funny way that I think might work
172:50 - well it's a tiny little dot a 1 pixel
172:52 - dot that rectangle I am going to now in
172:57 - sketch I'm going to have the keyboard be
173:00 - the controls so I'm gonna say key
173:03 - pressed oh I forgot how to do this
173:06 - already so like if key equals
173:13 - up what is it in p5 basically keep rest
173:18 - is an event that whenever I press a key
173:20 - this function happens that I can check
173:23 - what she did I press but I totally can
173:25 - never remember how to write this
173:27 - function so let's try to look at the p5
173:29 - reference somebody maybe in the chat
173:32 - will tell me let's look at key pressed
173:34 - if value equals zero know if key code
173:38 - equals left arrow this is good this is
173:40 - what I want it's a key code so key is
173:42 - for like the which character I press but
173:46 - if I'm using the arrows I need to use
173:47 - left arrow right so let me actually just
173:49 - grab this I'm gonna say if key code and
173:52 - I know I could use a switch statement
173:54 - I'm just not going to right now okay
173:57 - please don't don't at me that's what I'm
174:00 - supposed to say somebody taught me that
174:01 - who's younger than me cue code equals
174:06 - left arrow key code equals right arrow
174:11 - doing a terrible job of paste paste down
174:16 - arrow up arrow no no Auto format there
174:25 - we go
174:25 - okay so now what I want to do is if it's
174:28 - the less left arrow then snake dot set
174:32 - Direction this is the way I did it
174:34 - before I remember left is negative one
174:37 - to the rule negative one along the X and
174:39 - zero along the Y so I'm going to write a
174:41 - function that's like saying set the
174:43 - direction so this is for left this is
174:47 - for right
174:51 - this is for down this is for up negative
175:04 - one okay
175:06 - tidy code so I think this is the right
175:08 - idea depending on which key I press move
175:11 - the snake in that direction
175:14 - so now I can say I can write this
175:18 - function set direction and I'm getting
175:20 - an X and a Y and I'm just saying this
175:22 - dot X Direction equals x and this dot Y
175:24 - Direction equals y so whatever comes in
175:27 - the function sets those things people I
175:29 - can see the chat over there please do a
175:31 - switch David no duplicate my code and
175:34 - change it and make us would make it
175:35 - better use the switch statement okay so
175:38 - now I'm gonna do this let's zoom in here
175:40 - let's see if this works
175:41 - oh come on no I have to click over yes
175:43 - down look at this so now it's working
175:47 - right so I'm pressing all the keys and
175:48 - I'm moving it around perfect now I need
175:52 - to deal with something I don't want to
175:53 - have to like zoom him it's like so tiny
175:55 - so ultimately there's an issue here like
175:58 - I want to think about the snake in units
176:01 - of one here's my snake it moves one
176:03 - pixel over it moves one pixel over it
176:06 - moves one pixel over but I have a canvas
176:09 - that's 400 by 400 and I probably want to
176:11 - draw it as like a 10 by 10 thing so I
176:15 - want to have a variable I'm gonna have a
176:16 - variable I'm gonna call it our easy
176:18 - short for like resolution can you see
176:21 - that and I'm just to make that 10 so
176:23 - that variable and actually to be honest
176:26 - I could just use you know what I could
176:28 - do I could just use the scale function
176:30 - I'm just gonna use the skill so I was
176:32 - gonna use math and I was gonna always
176:35 - multiply its X location by that
176:36 - resolution and multiply it and use the
176:39 - resolution for the width but the truth
176:41 - of the matter is p5 has a scale function
176:45 - so I'm gonna say let resolution equal 10
176:49 - and then in the draw function I could
176:52 - just say scale by resolution and what
176:55 - that's going to do and notice like see
176:57 - look look at that I can change this to
176:58 - 50 I can make this 10 I can make this
177:02 - 100 it's just scaling it up and if I
177:04 - move this to there and so now if I make
177:06 - this 10 and I move to the right it's
177:10 - actually moving every 10 pixels also
177:13 - because when it changes by one it moves
177:16 - 10 and I could what I might want to do
177:18 - is you know you or might want the
177:19 - animation to go really fast but I'm
177:21 - gonna change the frame rate to 5 just to
177:23 - slow it down so we can see what's what's
177:26 - it's a little tricky here when using the
177:27 - p5 web editor is I need to click over
177:30 - here to give this preview pane focus so
177:33 - that it gets the key commands so now you
177:34 - can see it moving over and this you know
177:36 - this can the frame rate typically I
177:38 - don't want to like slow the frame rate
177:40 - nation down but this is a way I can
177:41 - control the speed of the sketch so this
177:43 - is what I'm gonna do okay so now I need
177:51 - okay so I need to have a food a piece of
177:54 - food so I'm gonna make the piece of food
177:57 - a just a vector that's some R and I
178:02 - could make a food class but I think
178:03 - that's overkill I'm gonna make it okay
178:06 - so here's now a tricky thing I want the
178:11 - food okay let's say my by sketch is 400
178:14 - by 400 and really so really my world is
178:18 - 40 by 40 but I scaled it up by 10 so I
178:22 - need a variable to keep track of the
178:26 - actual dimensions of the world so I'm
178:28 - gonna say I'm gonna use W now I don't
178:32 - know I'm starting at Pala columns or I'm
178:34 - gonna say W equal I'm gonna actually
178:37 - just put let W and let H here so I'm
178:40 - gonna say W equals floor with divided by
178:45 - resolution what is this width divided by
178:50 - resolution is 400 divided by 10 which is
178:53 - 40 and the reason I'm using floor
178:55 - there's just gets my math is off I want
178:57 - W to be an integer a whole number that
178:59 - will take off the decimal place H equals
179:03 - floor height and of course it's a square
179:05 - so I don't really need to have two
179:07 - separate values but your window might
179:09 - not be a square there okay so so now
179:14 - that I have that why was I doing this
179:16 - again oh the food because now I want to
179:20 - get an exposition and guess what I run
179:25 - before I'm gonna write a function food
179:28 - location food location and what happens
179:33 - in this function is I pick an X which is
179:36 - floor random W and a Y floor so I need a
179:43 - spot random H right I need to find a
179:45 - random spot for the food and set that
179:48 - there and then in draw I'm gonna make
179:52 - the food
179:53 - a red I'm standing a little bit in front
179:57 - of code but hopefully this is okay and
179:58 - I'm gonna say rectangle
180:00 - food X food y1 1 so you know I guess I
180:05 - could make it a point or something with
180:06 - this it's just everything is a view of
180:08 - unit 1 scaled up okay can i oh and I
180:13 - need to actually call at the beginning
180:16 - food location and why is it oh it's not
180:22 - RIT so you know what I need to do here
180:23 - is I need to say no stroke that stroke
180:28 - is getting scales in a strange way so
180:30 - this is actually 10 by 10 pixels it was
180:31 - much bigger because with a stroke there
180:36 - that's getting scaled as well so now we
180:39 - can see
180:40 - let's if I click over here we can see
180:43 - and eventually come on get that piece of
180:46 - food ok so now but so this is working
180:48 - they gave us working this is good this
180:50 - is much better than I did before hopes
180:52 - to do this a second time even though
180:54 - that was like a couple years ago let's
180:55 - make this 20 just because I want to be
180:58 - able to see it better
180:59 - ok so that's good and we just make sure
181:01 - things are lining up excellent so now I
181:03 - need a test I'm gonna say snake dot eat
181:07 - food so that means I need a function and
181:11 - let's put that though I don't know the
181:12 - order matter so much I'm gonna put this
181:14 - here and I'm gonna say eat food I'm just
181:23 - gonna make an argument called position
181:25 - so basically the food is getting passed
181:27 - in here and I'm eating the food if now
181:30 - this is really probably a bad idea
181:32 - because you never know in JavaScript if
181:35 - you've really got the number like 3 or
181:38 - if by accident you have the number three
181:40 - point zero zero zero zero zero zero one
181:42 - but I'm going to test in theory if the
181:45 - XY of the head of the snake is the same
181:49 - as the XY of the piece of food if
181:51 - they're equal I should be eating the
181:53 - food so let's let's just see if that
181:55 - works so I'm gonna say if so first let X
182:03 - equal let's just
182:04 - put this in a separate variable let y
182:10 - equal this stuff going to get that head
182:11 - of a snake location if x equals positive
182:20 - I then return true and also say console
182:31 - console I or say for it because I
182:33 - console a lot of print food eaten okay
182:38 - so let's see if this works it's a little
182:40 - bit dangerous a little bit treacherous
182:41 - and I'm gonna say return false otherwise
182:43 - and then in the sketch I'm gonna say if
182:48 - if I'm gonna have this return something
182:50 - if you eat the food then you just need a
182:54 - new food location right so immediately
182:56 - we should pick a new random location all
182:58 - right let's try this I missed it I can't
183:04 - get it oh so that's working all right so
183:08 - I think all my flooring of the numbers
183:10 - you know maybe I need to have some
183:13 - better if this this seems to be fine so
183:14 - I'm gonna live with that I'm happy with
183:17 - it okay so now we are so close what do I
183:21 - need to do this is going very remarkably
183:23 - well that's a sure sign for something to
183:27 - go wrong I'm gonna say this dot grow if
183:34 - I eat the food I want the snake to grow
183:37 - if I'm calling a function that I intend
183:40 - to be part of the snake object within
183:42 - the snake class I need to reference it
183:44 - by saying this grow and so that means I
183:46 - need to write another function grow and
183:50 - what that means is I want to expand the
183:53 - array okay okay well this is the tricky
183:57 - part this is where everything went wrong
183:59 - before I'm not even looking at the chat
184:02 - there's a chat going on I'm sure I would
184:03 - screaming at me I'm gonna add another
184:08 - variable this dot le n for length length
184:13 - of the snake and it starts as one so is
184:16 - that a minimum I know
184:18 - when I want to grow I want length to go
184:21 - up by one so I want the length to
184:23 - increase and they need to add something
184:25 - onto the array add something to the end
184:28 - add something to the beginning this is
184:31 - unclear to me so first of all let's try
184:35 - so so let's just try saying this dot
184:40 - body dot okay so first let me get the
184:47 - last I'm thinking about this you know
184:51 - what I think this is gonna be I think
184:53 - actually this is simpler than I think
184:54 - let's just try saying this dot body dot
184:57 - push create vector so I'm just gonna
185:00 - push a blank vector into it like I know
185:03 - I need something else in the array so
185:05 - let me just and push you something to
185:06 - add to the end of the array maybe I want
185:08 - to put it at the beginning I'll figure
185:10 - that out in a second
185:11 - but I'm just gonna push to the end of
185:12 - the array and actually I'm not realizing
185:15 - the flaw in that but that's okay yeah so
185:20 - actually so pushing I could put it in
185:23 - the beginning and that would actually
185:24 - work
185:25 - I think but okay I think we're gonna
185:30 - figure this that I'm like trying to
185:31 - think it through
185:32 - so that's easier than thinking through
185:33 - just coded so what I want to do now this
185:36 - whole thing so first of all shut what
185:39 - this means is anytime I want to draw the
185:42 - snake I don't actually want to draw I
185:46 - don't want to draw just a single
185:50 - rectangle I want to draw all the
185:51 - rectangles so I'm gonna say and I could
185:54 - use like a for of loop or something but
185:56 - I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna use a
185:58 - regular old fashioned this dot for loop
186:01 - this dot body dot length I plus plus and
186:05 - then this loop will go around here oh oh
186:12 - no oh no oh no I've killed the editor
186:20 - I've killed the editor let's pray
186:22 - autosave works by the way the editor has
186:25 - infinite loop protection in it so I was
186:27 - like not ring about making this happen
186:29 - but I have now called
186:31 - infinite loop and I've totally frozen
186:33 - the page I'm not sure why I didn't get
186:34 - the infinite loop protection but what
186:38 - I'm gonna have to do and we're gonna
186:39 - pray let's see let's let's just pray I'm
186:44 - gonna get this I'm gonna close the
186:47 - window you won't let me close and I'm
186:50 - gonna just go back to it let's see when
186:52 - it lasts Otto so I'm gonna quickly quick
186:53 - off this Auto refresh and where did I
186:56 - last leave off ah that's not so bad so
186:58 - the last time it auto saved was here
187:01 - and I'm going to I'm going to retype my
187:04 - loop more carefully without having auto
187:06 - refresh on but I is less than this body
187:09 - dot length I have to move this now back
187:12 - all the way over here I plus plus and
187:18 - I'm going to auto format that and I'm
187:20 - going to say this dot body dot I this so
187:24 - now I'm drawing every element in there
187:26 - okay like so now I'm gonna hit save
187:29 - project is saved so I have that oh I
187:36 - lost what I wrote and grow live and
187:38 - learn to move this over here alright
187:42 - because I had this open that's why so
187:44 - this actually comes back here what time
187:48 - is it 7:45 okay we're good we're good
187:50 - we're good
187:51 - I got stuff I got stuff so grow what did
187:54 - I do in that I said this dot body dot
187:57 - push create vector and I said this dot
188:01 - length I don't know if I need this
188:03 - length variable to be honest because by
188:04 - definition the length of the array is
188:06 - the length variable it was so sad and
188:10 - then did I add that it and then I added
188:12 - that too let's see I lost some code
188:14 - you're not working you're not really
188:16 - coding if you don't lose some code every
188:17 - once awhile to an infinite loop okay
188:19 - so here we're good now this is what's
188:23 - gonna happen here is really weird but
188:24 - I'm gonna get the food oops I missed the
188:27 - food so interestingly why am I not
188:32 - seeing I would imagine that I would see
188:34 - another so one thing I would guess that
188:37 - I'm gonna see another appendage but it
188:40 - would just be at 0-0 put oh look at me
188:44 - look at this push
188:45 - create vector and create vector at zero
188:48 - zero let me just do that so that if we
188:52 - rip so what we're gonna see here is this
188:56 - there we go so that second part of the
188:59 - snake is there but it's up there so what
189:02 - I need to do now is when I'm updating
189:04 - the snakes location this is I'm gonna
189:08 - comment this out for a second the first
189:10 - thing that I want to do and there's
189:11 - shift okay there's an array function
189:13 - called shift I forgot what I last time I
189:15 - did this I didn't use that I just
189:17 - manually moved all the spots in the
189:19 - array let's look at array JavaScript
189:22 - shift I don't actually know what this
189:25 - function does but everyone was telling
189:26 - me I should do it shift one two no look
189:30 - at that that's so perfect so this is
189:34 - what I want I want to shift all the
189:36 - elements down one and I guess I'm losing
189:38 - one so let me just see about let me see
189:40 - if I understand this so just in the
189:42 - console and we practice this let array
189:45 - equal five six nine 105 so that's what's
189:51 - in the array and if I say array shift
189:55 - whoops no that's what it returns did it
190:01 - shift it but it shifted oh so it's just
190:03 - giving me the thing that it got rid of
190:05 - and then it's making it one less so this
190:08 - is perfect because it's exactly what I
190:09 - need oh I love it
190:10 - so actually all I need to do every time
190:12 - an update is say this dot body dot shift
190:16 - and then that's moving everything over
190:20 - and then the last spot so one thing I
190:23 - need to do is let me save where it
190:25 - currently is so let me pop it does pop
190:28 - pop doesn't remove it from the array
190:30 - right so if I say array dot pop that
190:34 - gave me the element five but the array
190:36 - still oh no that got rid of it how do I
190:38 - get something off the end without
190:40 - removing it
190:42 - so unshipped adds from the beginning
190:45 - that's interesting how do I get the last
190:49 - element without removing it yeah that's
190:56 - what I'm
190:57 - this is what I'm planning to do grow
190:59 - yeah so update is shift and then I want
191:09 - to want to get well I'm just gonna do it
191:11 - the manual way this dot I'm just going
191:14 - to say let head equal this dot body dot
191:17 - and this dot body dot length minus one
191:20 - that's the last element dot copy so this
191:24 - is me taking the last element and making
191:27 - a copy of it and then what I want to do
191:28 - is say head X plus equal this X
191:32 - Direction head dot y plus equal this dot
191:35 - Y direction and then I just want to put
191:38 - that back on so I want to like save
191:42 - where it was and then move that and then
191:46 - the body is all there yes so I'm being
191:50 - told this is actually how to do it so
191:52 - that's the last element copying it let's
191:55 - so I just want to see something here for
191:57 - a second let's see if this works so why
192:00 - do I need something else let me just see
192:02 - what I've got here so one thing that I
192:05 - want to do what's wrong here this dot
192:07 - body index this 10 dot cannot read
192:11 - property copy of undefined so do I not
192:18 - have oh because I'm doing it after shift
192:21 - and if I'm shifting something with zero
192:24 - yeah if I'm shifting signature so shift
192:25 - has to happen after right cuz if it only
192:27 - has one thing in it I shift it it's gone
192:30 - okay so this is working now I look at
192:36 - that so this worked and it made it
192:39 - longer but because I it created it back
192:43 - at the start so I need to keep that
192:45 - location when I grow it so the same
192:47 - thing I need to do here in grow what I
192:51 - want to do is not add what I want to do
192:54 - is do this exact same thing and then
192:59 - push right I want to take the last one
193:02 - and add it to the end so I need to just
193:05 - duplicate where it was before to the end
193:08 - I think this should do the trick
193:12 - yep is it am I like going one step
193:17 - behind by accident I'm not sure well
193:20 - that's pretty good you know why the food
193:22 - oh oh you know what it's not to getting
193:25 - it until I get to the back why because
193:28 - eat is always checking this one I need
193:30 - to check the last element same thing
193:32 - this is very awkward the way I'm doing
193:34 - it and I'm sure somebody will make their
193:38 - own version that's less awkward but I
193:40 - need to check the location of the head
193:42 - against the food here we go let's try
193:46 - this one more time
193:47 - snake game go there we go and up yeah
193:54 - this is better okay great this is
193:55 - working alright now guess what one more
194:00 - thing I need to know when to restart the
194:03 - game when do I die
194:04 - so I'm going to do I'm gonna do a
194:07 - function called like check you know
194:10 - check for death or like end game and
194:16 - what I need to do is I need to check if
194:18 - the head intersects with any of the
194:21 - other positions so the head as we know
194:25 - is well it's this this is a little bit
194:32 - weird what I'm doing that's the last
194:34 - spot and now I can say for let I equals
194:39 - 0 I is less than this stop body dot
194:42 - length minus 1 I don't want to check the
194:45 - head against itself I plus plus I'm
194:48 - gonna say let part equal this body index
194:53 - I and then I'm gonna say if we care we
194:57 - went off for the purpose of dough
195:00 - editing we can we if part index if part
195:06 - x equals x and part dot part dot y
195:11 - equals y then return true the game is
195:15 - over or if X is greater than what was it
195:22 - W minus 1 right
195:24 - it's gone off the screen or X is less
195:27 - than 0 or Y is greater than H minus 1 or
195:32 - Y is less than 0 then also return true I
195:37 - should probably check that first because
195:40 - if you're off the edge I don't need to
195:41 - check I don't need to check any of the
195:43 - body parts oh but I need to first get
195:52 - the x and y values so I'm doing
195:53 - something a little weird where sometimes
195:54 - I'm using like the vector and then I'm
195:56 - saying paused at X and positives I'm
195:59 - pulling out the X&Y from the vector and
196:02 - then at the end I'm going to say return
196:03 - false so let's see if now I can get
196:09 - endgame to work so in here I'm gonna say
196:13 - also now at the end if snake dot endgame
196:18 - I'm just gonna say print print end game
196:23 - and I'm gonna say background to 5500 and
196:31 - no loop so I'm just gonna completely
196:33 - shut down the p5 sketch if the game ends
196:36 - so this is not just thing what you want
196:38 - to do first interaction design but I'm
196:42 - just testing the feature so the first
196:44 - thing I might do is just try to go off
196:45 - the edge so I'm gonna go off the bottom
196:48 - yeah okay so that works so going off the
196:51 - edge at least the bottom like I should
196:52 - probably test the other edges whoa what
196:56 - just happened there and I took my Auto
196:58 - refresh off I'm gonna put that on so if
197:04 - I go off the top ooh that didn't work I
197:05 - probably had a mistake somewhere in
197:07 - there yeah oh why this should be Y OOP
197:12 - that was a mistake ok so yeah all right
197:15 - hopefully that fixed that I'm gonna and
197:18 - now what I need to do so one thing I
197:20 - need to do just to be able to test
197:21 - better is I'm gonna add something I'm
197:24 - gonna add the mousepressed function and
197:28 - I'm gonna say this snake dot grow so
197:33 - anytime I clicked in the house I'm gonna
197:35 - grow the snake so I could do it so
197:37 - test this feature oh whoops
197:41 - shoot oh and you know what I should set
197:43 - the snake in the middle so the snakes
197:46 - location should probably be initially
197:51 - the W divided by 2 and H divided by 2
197:55 - and I've got to keep everything in
197:57 - integer so I've got to put floor in here
198:01 - just in case all right so now let me
198:06 - well why did that oh because when I grow
198:14 - the head becomes the same location as
198:17 - the other part of the body and then I
198:20 - check to see if the game is over but
198:23 - shouldn't it fix it with oh but if it's
198:26 - not moving so I got to move it first
198:29 - I mean this should be ok no oh because
198:35 - if I click to get focus oh this is so
198:41 - set this is like a silly debugging thing
198:43 - so I'm what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
198:45 - have it grow with the spacebar not
198:47 - mousepressed
198:49 - else if key equals space I'm just trying
198:54 - to do this to debug it and so I can do
198:56 - whatever I want
198:57 - now click over here and I move it so I'm
199:01 - gonna make it longer so now let's see if
199:07 - it dies yep okay great so I think I
199:11 - finished this game really what I want to
199:13 - do is come up with an end screen or
199:15 - restart the game or have some sort of
199:16 - score let's see
199:18 - before I go how long I can play it

204:19 - in the this sort of afternoon early
204:20 - evening time depending on as I know that

204:48 - Samia alright so thank you everybody
204:52 - you'll notice that if you join to be a
204:54 - member
204:55 - the coding training you get access to
204:57 - new emojis I send you some stickers stay
205:02 - tuned for new t-shirts with new designs
205:05 - this is a new logo the designer is Jason
205:08 - headland Jason hey Glen calm this is
205:11 - still kind of somewhat of a working
205:12 - draft and I will see if I can answer one
205:16 - or two questions still how many people
205:21 - are watching by the way right now I mean
205:23 - what I'm gonna do I'm in just in case
205:25 - things crash I'm gonna hit stop
205:27 - recording there's now the whole
205:29 - livestream has been recorded to disc
205:32 - coding training piece to repeat
205:35 - processing p5 there's actually another
205:37 - secret sticker on the bottom someone's
205:41 - asking Wow Oh guess what
205:44 - three blue one brown which is a channel
205:47 - on the YouTube which has wonderful
205:49 - content is going to release a video
205:51 - about quaternions very soon and I do
205:57 - solemnly affirm with the very sacred
206:01 - train whistle that I will do a video on
206:04 - quaternions at some point based on
206:07 - whatever three blue and brown does and
206:09 - when I say at some point
206:11 - I mean sometime in the next 25 years but
206:14 - hopefully sometime this year who created
206:18 - p5 p5 is created by the original theatre
206:22 - p5 is Lauren McCarthy the project itself
206:24 - is a has been built by a large
206:29 - collaboration of many people the p5
206:31 - community and go the p5 website and the
206:33 - p5 github to see who all those people
206:35 - are and the processing foundation raises
206:37 - money to help maintain the p5 library
206:42 - you only get the so I have patreon this
206:47 - is a very confusing thing and maybe
206:49 - someday I'll have a better system I have
206:50 - both patreon and YouTube it's for
206:53 - memberships YouTube memberships you get
206:56 - the emojis and the icon and stickers you
207:02 - can also get the stickers with patreon
207:05 - members and an invitation to slack
207:06 - channel so youtube's membership is the
207:09 - equivalent of five dollar-a-month
207:10 - patreon but if you do the five
207:12 - dollar-a-month patreon you don't get the
207:13 - YouTube stuff the only reason you might
207:15 - want to do patreon is if you prefer the
207:17 - platform and if you want to do one of
207:20 - the higher level pledges where I'll mail
207:21 - you some books and stuff like that but
207:22 - just be aware that those higher level
207:25 - pledges it takes me quite a while to get
207:27 - this stuff to you you should get it
207:28 - within a year that's that's sort of what
207:30 - I'm promising but as I do a mailing
207:32 - every few months this live stream has
207:36 - been up for at least three hours and
207:40 - yeah so once again I just want to say
207:45 - that this live stream is dedicated to
207:49 - the memory of coding train contributor
207:51 - enthusiast Madden I'm very sad about
207:56 - hearing about the news of Americans
207:58 - death this week and but I wanted to
208:03 - mention that again at the end because
208:05 - his contributions and his spirit really
208:07 - meant a lot to me in the channel in the
208:09 - community and I talked a bit more about
208:12 - Maron and showed the website at the
208:13 - beginning of the livestream so when this
208:15 - gets archived you can go back and see
208:16 - that and I'll put links to information
208:18 - about Meriden and his web site in the
208:20 - image chat okay alka says I can't wait
208:23 - for the 50th anniversary coding train up
208:25 - sewed with the introduction of
208:26 - quadrillions thank you everyone I have
208:29 - not had dinner I clearly need to have
208:31 - dinner and I'm going to hit stop
208:34 - streaming I'm gonna go and thank you
208:38 - everyone for your support I'm checking
208:41 - my notifications on Twitter and let's
208:50 - look at my mentions on Twitter I got to
208:52 - find my is dashboard okay so my
208:57 - dashboard says two hours 56 minutes and
208:59 - 30 seconds so almost three hours and
209:03 - here's the chat I'm gonna just type in

209:09 - bye and good night by the way this is
209:13 - the computer that has the broken a key
209:14 - this is the old coding train computer
209:17 - this is the new coding train computer
209:18 - see you next week
209:22 - okay and I am now going to click this
209:25 - button that says stop streaming and when
209:27 - I click that I awkwardly just disappear
