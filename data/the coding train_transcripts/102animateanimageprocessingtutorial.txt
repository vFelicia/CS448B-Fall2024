00:03 - Hi, okay in this video I want to take the ideas that we had from the
00:06 - previous one about images and just move it one little step further.
00:10 - So if you remember at some point
00:13 - I think we probably had an example that looked something like this. Very basic idea of two bubble objects...
00:19 - The bubble objects have some functions like ascend which makes them float up
00:24 - display which draws them as circles and...
00:27 - Top which I guess stops them at the top.
00:29 - So if I were to run this program again, we can see we have these two bubbles floating up to the top.
00:34 - We have a bubble class; the clas... each bubble has an x and y diameter blah blah blah
00:38 - So the point of what I want to talk about here in this video is how do we take something like this?
00:44 - But instead of drawing these shapes have the bubbles be an image perhaps an image of a nice flower.
00:50 - So this time I learned my lesson from the last video and if I go to the Data Folder in here...
00:56 - I can see that I have an image of a flower. So I want this flower to appear instead of those circles.
01:02 - So say this actually isn't that difficult of a problem to solve, but let's do it together.
01:07 - Step by step and just see how this works
01:10 - and then you can kind of take it and do a little bit more with it afterwards okay, so...
01:15 - The first thing we know we need to do is...
01:18 - Make a PImage variable. I'm going to call it flower then in setup
01:22 - I want to load an image, and I have the path to my flower.
01:28 - So now I have a global variable called flour that flour can be used anytime anywhere
01:34 - I want it could be displayed on the screen. I can for example
01:38 - Just draw it. image, flower, zero, zero, so now I run this program
01:43 - I'm going to see the flower is back there and the bubbles are floating in front of it.
01:47 - I can do... one thing
01:48 - I might do is say image mode just to emphasize this center
01:53 - And then draw the flower in the middle of the screen.
01:58 - We can see now I have the flower in the middle this again is just using an image kind of as a static background
02:03 - which is probably a little bit less interesting than
02:07 - Than actually having be this
02:10 - Sprite if you will this this this this replacement for a shape that we may animate rotate changes color ETc
02:17 - So let's think about it now. I don't want to display the image here. Where do I want to display it?
02:22 - I want the image to draw itself for each bubble what each bubble has a display function each bubble has a display function if each
02:29 - Bubble has a display function. This is where I need to go in and start changing my code.
02:35 - What do I do for the bubble? I draw an ellipse. Now what do I want to do? I want to draw an image.
02:41 - I want to draw an i... and here I want to keep that image mode center, and I want to draw the flower at x y
02:48 - Let's run this now and look I've got a flower floating up. Oh I got some sad things going on number one
02:55 - You could see the sort of rectangular edges even though. It's white. This is what I was mentioning
02:59 - Maybe it would have been better if I had downloaded a Png with a transparent layer
03:03 - So that only the flower pixels would show through but these are all things that can be solved
03:07 - You know this is not the crucial component here now. I do have something else going on
03:12 - Which is that... Oh each bubble had a diameter variable which was controlling its size. So why not use...
03:19 - diameter diameter to be the width and height and only comment out
03:25 - And now I have look at this. I have my two flowers floating above and now, now
03:29 - I'm lucky because these aren't overlapping so I don't really see I
03:33 - Don't really see those hard edges anymore of course if they were to overlap if I were to go back
03:38 - To this part of the program and start them kind of closer to each other you can see that
03:45 - I'm seeing this problem, so
03:48 - This you know, I don't want to spend too much time with this because for me again,
03:54 - The exciting interesting stuff is when we're going to start looking at the pixels of an image
03:57 - and how do we make up our own images and
04:00 - Mix the pixels around and do an invent our own image processing algorithms.
04:03 - But this is something you might take some time to play with in practice for example go and find yourself an image with some transparency.
04:09 - Maybe just try actually you know a quick and dirty solution might be
04:13 - That I'm just going to give it a tint with keeping the color at full, but give it some alpha
04:20 - and let me go back and
04:23 - Put them closer to each other again
04:25 - You know not great, but a little bit better at least they're kind of like semi blended together
04:29 - but that's not such a great solution, but I don't know why I bothered showing it to you, but
04:34 - I know
04:36 - I want it to be back to what it was um so some of the things you might think about doing are
04:41 - Give the objects color so that you can tint them differently could you apply translate and rotate to the image of the flowers?
04:49 - Spin perhaps that would be an interesting thing to try
04:52 - Another thing you might think about is I got kind of lucky if I go and look at my flower
05:00 - My flower happens to be if I find the resolution
05:04 - Right there, it happens to be a perfect square. It's 300 by 300
05:10 - So this was kind of lucky in that in my code
05:14 - When I changed the size of the flower, I could just change the width and height to be the same value
05:20 - But what if you had an image that you needed to keep the ratio of the width and height the same how might you change...
05:26 - the size
05:27 - you might have different images larger and smaller width but keeping that...
05:31 - That core resolution intact give you a secret you might be able to, not a secret, but you know you can get
05:38 - The width of sorry you can get the width of that image
05:42 - By saying the name of the image dot width so one thing I could do is say flower dot width times 0.5 0.3 0.7
05:49 - I guess I'm giving you the solution
05:50 - but give that a try and see it what happens there the other thing that I think is a really key element and maybe
05:57 - I should make a video actually just about this
05:59 - But we really did something which is a bit of a problem that I don't think I should point out. This PImage flower is
06:04 - a global variable and the bubble object is just
06:08 - Accessing that global variable and actually you know what the next video
06:11 - I have in mind the looking at this so we're gonna bring that back into the next video this perfect
06:16 - So the next video will solve this problem, but really what if I want...
06:20 - I want a whole lot of different flowers and every time I make a bubble I
06:24 - Make it with a random flower image
06:25 - I can't just have a global variable flower that the image is kind of happens to be getting when it's time to draw itself
06:32 - I need each
06:35 - Object to store perhaps its own
06:40 - Image each objects should know which image is it displaying and how could you solve that problem?
06:46 - that might be something you give yourself a little try too and um in the next video which I want to talk about having an array of images,
06:52 - we'll look at a solution to this. Okay this wasn't so bad. I think this was okay, it could be better, but
06:59 - That's what it is. Okay
07:00 - I'm going to turn this off and I got a guy got don't you got him do the next one?
07:03 - I don't have a lot of time here, okay?
