00:01 - hello welcome to part three of my p5
00:04 - Jeff and sound tutorials in this video
00:07 - I'm going to show you how to jump to a
00:10 - particular point of time in a song how
00:12 - to know where you are in the song how to
00:14 - trigger a particular drawing to happen
00:16 - in a particular point in the song all
00:18 - sorts of possibilities dealing with time
00:20 - and a sound file so where I last left
00:23 - off was a simple example where I could
00:25 - play and pause a particular sound file
00:28 - and one of the things I want to do now
00:30 - is add a button I want to add a button
00:32 - here that's called jump where when I
00:34 - press that button I jump to a particular
00:36 - point in time in the video so let me go
00:39 - to code and in this in here I'm gonna
00:43 - show you a bunch of functions so the
00:44 - functions that I'm trying to demonstrate
00:45 - here are jump which allows you to jump
00:48 - to a particular point of time and I said
00:49 - in the video but it's a sound file to
00:51 - song duration which is telling you which
00:54 - is a function that will I don't know
00:55 - telling you I don't know what tells you
00:57 - anything but that function returns a
00:58 - value which is the length of a
01:00 - particular sound file in seconds so the
01:03 - key measurement by the way of time here
01:04 - is seconds so if it's a minute long
01:08 - you're gonna get 60 and you're getting
01:10 - floating-point numbers so it's if it's a
01:12 - minute and half a second long you're
01:14 - gonna get sixty point five so duration
01:16 - is a function that returns the value
01:18 - which is the total duration of a sound
01:20 - file in seconds and current time is a
01:23 - function that returns to the current
01:24 - time where the playback currently is and
01:27 - jump is a function that sets the
01:29 - particular time so if I were to say jump
01:30 - 0 that's like rewinding back to zero
01:33 - there may actually be a rewind function
01:34 - I'm not sure but you could always say
01:35 - jump zero so let's just look at a few of
01:38 - these functions the first thing I'll do
01:40 - is I'm gonna add a button I'll call it
01:42 - jump button and I'll say a jump button
01:45 - equals create button and I'm just gonna
01:48 - say jump and then what I'm gonna do is
01:52 - say jump button dot mousepressed and I'm
01:57 - gonna create a function called jump song
02:01 - you can come up with better names and
02:04 - then I'm gonna write a function called
02:05 - jump song I should mention by the way
02:10 - that everything I'm doing here with
02:11 - these callbacks kind of work
02:13 - because I just have one button and one
02:15 - song and you know I have using global
02:17 - variables to communicate across them at
02:19 - some point someone should remind me to
02:21 - make a video that shows what if I have
02:23 - like 10 different songs and ten
02:24 - different buttons can I reuse the same
02:26 - callback function you also might see
02:28 - this function written directly in there
02:30 - as an anonymous function and I think
02:31 - I've referred to that in another video
02:32 - somewhere but these are some issues that
02:34 - could be coming up in your head but I
02:35 - digress let me get back to the matter at
02:37 - hand
02:38 - which is right here I want to say var
02:42 - I'm gonna just say length equals song
02:45 - duration so what this is going to do is
02:50 - it's going to give me the total duration
02:52 - of the song in seconds and put it here
02:54 - in this variable called le n for length
02:56 - and then what I'm going to say is song
02:59 - jump length divided by 2 so in that
03:05 - sense I am just want to jump to the
03:07 - middle of the song and you know I could
03:10 - look at the mp3 file and figure out how
03:12 - long it is I just picked like you know I
03:14 - I could actually just say junk to jump
03:15 - to 20 seconds let's do that right now
03:17 - really quickly just to see so I'm gonna
03:19 - run this you should see a jump button
03:22 - first thing to play it and then I can
03:24 - jump that work
03:28 - listen closely yeah I'm always jumping
03:35 - to that point by clicking the jump
03:38 - button now I could by the way this might
03:40 - be interesting is to try this let's just
03:43 - jump to a random point in the song right
03:45 - random is going to give me a value
03:47 - between zero and the duration of the
03:48 - song so every time I press this button
03:50 - now let me play it and hold on let's
03:58 - look by the way at I'm gonna make a
04:01 - variable there T equals that random t4
04:05 - time that random point in the song and
04:07 - I'm gonna jump to that the reason why
04:09 - I'm doing that is I want to just look at
04:11 - it see it in the console so now song is
04:14 - loaded I'm gonna play it so that's 28
04:23 - seconds
04:25 - two minutes in I like this part
04:38 - okay whatever oh I think I'm knocking
04:43 - over things down I lost my own the music
04:46 - makes me lost in my own world pause okay
04:50 - so where are we so let me look back at
04:53 - my list over here I'm now talked about
04:55 - jump and duration ah so so okay so there
04:59 - is a function called current time so
05:01 - what if I want something to happen based
05:03 - on a moment of time in the song so
05:06 - current time is always going to give me
05:08 - that moment of time in the song so if I
05:10 - come over here and if I know I just run
05:12 - this I could say song current time I can
05:16 - look at this in the console we're at 5
05:19 - seconds 7 seconds 8 seconds well I love
05:23 - this I love that part of 9 seconds so I
05:25 - could jump to 9 seconds lots of
05:26 - possibilities here but let's say I go
05:30 - back and I add the draw function and
05:34 - what do I want to do in the draw
05:36 - function what I want to say is something
05:38 - like if current if song got and we're
05:43 - gonna have a problem here but let's see
05:45 - let's see if that problem comes up if
05:46 - song current time is greater than 5 then
05:49 - background 255 0 255 so I suddenly want
05:54 - to see a lovely pinkish background as
05:57 - soon as I get past 5 seconds now I'm
06:01 - anticipating perhaps a problem because
06:04 - draw is going to trigger immediately and
06:08 - the song sound file might not be loaded
06:11 - yet and so this might say I can't deal
06:13 - with this because the sound file isn't
06:14 - load gift maybe Peapod yes we'll handle
06:16 - this gracefully behind the scenes I'm
06:18 - not sure let's find out
06:19 - Oh actually there's no problem because
06:23 - I'm not even playing it at the beginning
06:24 - so actually it handle to gracefully
06:27 - behind the scenes so I'm gonna hit play
06:29 - and count one one thousand two one
06:32 - thousand three one thousand so we can
06:37 - see that triggered something to happen
06:38 - at a particular point in the music now
06:42 - here's the thing I'm showing you that
06:45 - just as something that you could use
06:46 - current time as of as a way of knowing
06:50 - where you are in the music but actually
06:52 - there's a better way of doing that with
06:53 - this cueing function so you know it
06:55 - might be more like something that I
06:56 - might use current time for more likely
06:58 - would be something like this like let me
07:02 - actually just whoops let me actually
07:04 - just set the color according to the time
07:06 - in the music that's like a variable
07:08 - that's constantly changing and you can
07:13 - see now as you know as we get closer and
07:17 - closer to 255 seconds do you see the
07:21 - color changing nope this is working
07:27 - demand let's get the code while we're
07:29 - waiting song current time 0 255 that
07:33 - seems like that should work let's see
07:36 - where we are yeah I guess 25 just 25
07:42 - seconds is it very much so just to make
07:46 - this work let me multiply that by 10 and
07:52 - we should see the color changing as the
07:55 - sons play yes yes yes
08:07 - it most definitely is I see a purplish
08:10 - hue coming in okay so highlight off you
08:13 - hopefully you skipped this last like
08:15 - five seconds be rambling because what I
08:16 - really want to show you here ups and I
08:18 - lost I lost what I'm working with here
08:21 - so what I really want to show you here
08:25 - is how to use the add cue function so
08:27 - psalm current time is a variable that
08:29 - gives you where you are currently in the
08:31 - particular piece of music but you can
08:36 - also do something called add cue so that
08:40 - what add cue does is I could say song
08:43 - got add cue and to add a cue I need
08:46 - three things I need well I actually only
08:49 - need two things but optionally I can
08:50 - have a third thing so let's let me start
08:53 - with two things I need the time and
08:55 - seconds where I want the thing to happen
08:58 - and then I need the that I need a
09:02 - function that gets called at that time
09:04 - in seconds so I'm gonna say function add
09:07 - cue five seconds I want to add like a
09:11 - heart or something but I'm just gonna
09:12 - I'm just going to call change but I'm
09:14 - gonna do something really not that
09:15 - interesting I'm gonna make a function
09:18 - call change background and I'm gonna
09:20 - call this function change background and
09:25 - what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make a
09:27 - random background so what I've done here
09:33 - is I've added a cue to that song at five
09:36 - seconds whenever that song is playing
09:38 - back in five seconds call this function
09:40 - change background whoops not ready to
09:45 - play it if I ever press the play button
09:48 - before it's loaded at the moment
09:51 - I got to five second time so you can see
09:57 - so I wonder actually if I jump by the
10:00 - way back to the beginning I'm gonna jump
10:04 - back to the beginning if it'll does it
10:05 - again so at five seconds I have to wait
10:10 - five seconds
10:12 - I got a random back on the jump back to
10:14 - the beginning of the song does that Q
10:17 - occur again at five seconds it does so
10:21 - that Q is permanently in there even if
10:23 - the song is looping and if you ever jump
10:25 - back to previously before that Q now
10:28 - let's let's say that what I want and
10:32 - pause the music let's say that what I
10:34 - want is actually at five seconds to
10:36 - change the background to blue well one
10:41 - of the nice things about the add Q
10:42 - function is it allows you to add a third
10:46 - argument and I'm gonna make a color the
10:48 - color blue and what it does is it takes
10:51 - where of that third argument is and
10:52 - passes it into the callback function so
10:56 - I can make that a variable called like
10:59 - Co L for color and do this so they said
11:02 - let me make this at two seconds just so
11:04 - it happens a little bit more quickly I'm
11:06 - gonna refresh this and I'm now gonna say
11:09 - play and a two seconds you should see a
11:13 - blue background and now I can add
11:15 - another cue with that same callback and
11:19 - four seconds with this color and I can
11:22 - add another cue with white at six
11:26 - seconds and if I run this again oops
11:30 - we've got blue
11:35 - turquoise sir light blue wait jump back
11:40 - to the beginning blue turquoise so
11:47 - anyway if you knew about certain like
11:49 - flourishes and the music where you want
11:52 - to burst the particles to come on the
11:53 - scene or you want to change the way if
11:55 - you're creating music visualizer we're
11:57 - at this point of time the music you want
11:58 - to completely change what it's doing
12:00 - this add cue function will allow you do
12:02 - a lot more than just change the
12:03 - background certainly and in addition to
12:07 - that the cues could be dynamic based on
12:09 - you reading the sound file I mean later
12:11 - I might actually look at beat detection
12:13 - so you could have something happen like
12:14 - with the beat but if you pre knew the
12:16 - sort of tempo and knew the moments of
12:18 - time of the beat in advance you could
12:20 - create all sorts of interesting things
12:22 - to happen in fact you could listen to a
12:23 - song and kind of play along with it on
12:25 - the keyboard and save time codes and
12:27 - then load that is like a JSON data file
12:30 - and have all those time codes trigger
12:32 - certain things to happen with a certain
12:33 - piece of planet there's lots of
12:34 - possibilities of here what you could do
12:35 - with sort of cueing and jumping along
12:37 - with a piece of music so I hope you
12:39 - enjoyed that and learned a little bit
12:40 - about time in a sound file and I'm not
12:43 - sure what I'm doing in the next video
12:44 - but there's gonna be a whole lot more
12:45 - stuff about sound in p5.js
12:48 - to come thanks for watching
