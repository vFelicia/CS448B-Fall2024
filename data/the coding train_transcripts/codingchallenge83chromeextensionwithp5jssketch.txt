00:01 - chrome extension coating challenge
00:03 - number two I'm also going in this
00:05 - coating challenge I just made one that
00:07 - replaces images with kittens if you
00:09 - didn't watch that already you can also
00:10 - check out the Chrome extension
00:12 - tutorial playlist for a lot of
00:14 - background information but in this video
00:16 - I'm going to attempt to make a Chrome
00:18 - extension for any web page that you're
00:20 - on like the p5.js library page that I
00:23 - can like doodle over it so and I'm going
00:27 - to do over it with a p5.js sketch so how
00:31 - do I do that so one thing is so I I did
00:33 - already
00:34 - but one of the first things you need for
00:36 - a Chrome extension if you're watching in
00:37 - other videos you already know this is a
00:39 - manifesto JSON file that is the
00:41 - configuration and all the information
00:43 - about your Chrome extension that you
00:45 - need so this being just a Content script
00:48 - I want it to work on any URL and more
00:52 - likely I probably want to do something
00:53 - where I press a button and then I can
00:54 - draw on maybe I get a pop-up with an
00:56 - interface to pick the color but we'll
00:57 - get to all that later right now I'm just
00:59 - gonna do the simple thing that for any
01:01 - web page I can suddenly draw on it so
01:03 - I'm gonna put all the code for drawing
01:05 - in sketch j/s and just to show you what
01:07 - I mean like a simple p5 sketch would be
01:12 - something like this function set up
01:13 - function draw I'm going to say create
01:15 - canvas I'm just gonna just give some
01:18 - arbitrary size right now I'm gonna say
01:21 - I'm gonna like absolute position it so
01:25 - that it is over and I'm gonna say clear
01:28 - so I don't think I need to say clear I
01:29 - think by definition is clear so that
01:31 - it's a transparent canvas and actually
01:33 - I'm not even gonna do that I just want
01:34 - to see the canvas on the page so I'm
01:36 - gonna say background zero so here's the
01:39 - thing now let me try running this
01:40 - extension let's see what happens so I
01:43 - put I I have this manifest.json I have
01:46 - this sketch let's load the extension let
01:49 - me close a bunch of this extra stuff if
01:52 - you're wondering why everything appears
01:55 - to be an image of a kitten it's because
01:57 - I'm still running my other Chrome
01:59 - extension so I'm going to I'm going to
02:01 - keep that enabled I'm gonna load a new
02:02 - extension called because I can't turn
02:06 - off the kitten one sketch and so again
02:10 - you need to be at Chrome slash lash
02:13 - extension
02:13 - and you need to have developer mode on
02:15 - and you can find out more about this in
02:17 - some of my other tutorial videos p5
02:19 - sketch version 0.1 is now running so let
02:23 - probably I probably should turn this one
02:25 - off but let's go to this web page now
02:27 - that I want to draw on open up the
02:29 - chrome console I'm gonna let this be
02:32 - myself some more space here I'm going to
02:34 - so actually it's time I've got to
02:38 - disable this because this extension is
02:40 - spitting out a lot of stuff in the
02:42 - console and I want to just look at the
02:43 - stuff for the p5 sketch so I don't see
02:48 - anything like the extensions I think
02:51 - nothing going on here well let me at
02:53 - least say console dot log sketch started
03:02 - sketch looping I know why this isn't
03:06 - working by the way and being I'm kind of
03:07 - like setting the stage here for what I
03:09 - want to talk about and then I'm gonna
03:11 - say console dot log its sketch block
03:17 - okay so let's reload this extension
03:21 - reload and I'm gonna hit refresh sketch
03:26 - blah but no setup a no draw so here's
03:30 - the thing well a couple things number
03:33 - one is I didn't include the p5 libraries
03:37 - I mean I have them in there I have
03:38 - sketched a sp5 dot JSP five dom dot yes
03:41 - so I've gotta at least in manifesto JSON
03:44 - reference those so let's say and I might
03:46 - not p5 Dhananjay s and this should be
03:48 - double quotes so I want all of these
03:51 - JavaScript libraries so this is by the
03:53 - way how you can reference another
03:55 - JavaScript library in a Chrome extension
03:56 - and I think there's a way to do this
03:58 - with a URL path I'll have to come back
04:00 - to that another time
04:02 - so I can do that let's reload the
04:07 - extension I'm gonna laughs if this works
04:09 - which it really shouldn't hit refresh ah
04:12 - there we go
04:13 - Oh Sita whoa oh my goodness
04:17 - it sort of did something well it
04:18 - actually ran set up whoa
04:21 - so interestingly enough I'm kind of
04:26 - intrigued by this because there's a
04:28 - thing that I was about to explain which
04:30 - is that I have to use something called
04:31 - instance mode opening up so I'm gonna
04:35 - just let's just just humor me for a
04:38 - second I'm gonna take out this now let's
04:41 - just see what happens now for some
04:44 - reason the Dom library didn't seem to
04:46 - work but the other stuff did which is
04:47 - weird
04:48 - let's run this again Oh weird oh it's
04:53 - there I'm shocked I'm shocked it just
04:58 - worked that's so weird but the Dom
05:00 - library stuff didn't work why does the
05:04 - order matter oh maybe it's just that
05:06 - interesting something changed since the
05:08 - last time I tried this this is gonna be
05:12 - much easier than I thought I thought I
05:14 - was gonna have to explain instance mode
05:15 - let's try putting the Dom library gigs
05:17 - they ordered late load in these orders
05:20 - let's try this again
05:23 - reload so now let me
05:27 - let's try sorry let's go back to sketch
05:29 - and let's let's use the Dom library now
05:35 - and once again reload again and it
05:39 - refresh yeah look at that huh well
05:44 - la-dee-da so amazingly I can actually
05:48 - just put a p5 sketch in the content
05:53 - script maybe this is a bad idea for some
05:55 - reason when I made an example for this
05:58 - last year I had to use something called
05:59 - instance mode and if you want to know
06:01 - instance mode is I will include a link
06:03 - to a video tutorial about that I thought
06:04 - p5 does this thing where it before to be
06:07 - beginner-friendly it allows you to
06:08 - declare set up and draw in the sort of
06:10 - global world of JavaScript and for
06:13 - whatever reason I thought that that
06:14 - didn't work in a Content script and you
06:16 - had to kind of namespace things in the
06:18 - instance mode way these terms might not
06:20 - mean anything to you
06:22 - but you can watch that instance mode
06:24 - video if you're kind of wondering about
06:26 - that let's keep going so let's let's
06:28 - let's let's finish this off so I'm gonna
06:30 - take this out I'm gonna put clear
06:36 - in draw I'm gonna say a line from Mouse
06:39 - X Mouse Y to previous Mouse X previous
06:43 - Mouse Y and I'm going to say stroke zero
06:48 - stroke wait for and what else do I want
06:54 - to do ah so this is the other thing I
06:56 - probably want to make the canvas fill
06:58 - the page so right now I'll just use
07:00 - window width and window height so let's
07:07 - go back now and reload hey where's my
07:17 - canvas let's see do I have an error
07:19 - sketch blah now alright let's let's see
07:26 - hmm so how do i D bug this mm-hmm
07:31 - let's not put let's put a background
07:34 - here what a pain to reload
07:42 - can I just I can just do a refresh no
07:45 - okay refresh okay that worked ooh and
07:50 - it's there oh oh oh weird okay hold on a
07:57 - second so why didn't that work first of
08:00 - all I wanted this I want to say if mouse
08:01 - is pressed hmm so it's working that
08:07 - canvas is there it's interesting how its
08:08 - underneath some things and I wonder if
08:10 - that's kind of the issue
08:13 - so let's reload reload again somebody in
08:21 - the chat I'm sure it's telling me
08:22 - exactly what I'm doing wrong and then oh
08:26 - well it works I don't know why it work
08:28 - before okay so I can do things like I
08:31 - love p5 and I'm going to make a little
08:37 - heart
08:38 - so this is this is just a very beginning
08:40 - stuff here now here's the thing there's
08:43 - some some flaws here that I can give you
08:45 - I'm gonna scroll and
08:48 - I can't draw down here anymore cuz that
08:52 - canvas is actually just a very is I said
08:57 - window with and window height so I could
08:59 - do something like get the body height I
09:01 - think of the whole page to make the
09:02 - canvas over the whole page but it could
09:04 - be a really long page another thing I
09:06 - could do is like move the canvas as I
09:07 - scroll I couldn't like just do the body
09:10 - height but one of the things you might
09:13 - notice here is that I've really messed
09:15 - with your ability to click on links
09:17 - because the canvas is kind of stole is
09:19 - overlaid on top of everything and it's
09:22 - stolen it's stolen a focus from all of
09:25 - the underlying stuff so thank you to me
09:28 - I am so me and others in the chat who
09:30 - have given me some good advice about
09:31 - this there are some CSS properties that
09:34 - I can try to add so since I've got the
09:36 - p5 library loaded anyway I could say see
09:38 - that style
09:39 - what was it pointer in the pointer
09:42 - events like this is a CSS property that
09:46 - will say like hey I don't want the
09:47 - canvas to receive any point your events
09:49 - so those pointer events will pass
09:51 - through underneath now this might not
09:53 - totally work hit refresh so now I'm sort
10:00 - of able to get it but like it's working
10:03 - but and you can see yeah so this is kind
10:05 - of and interestingly you can see that
10:06 - the the canvas is still there that's
10:10 - because github is actually not going to
10:12 - new pages it's kind of refreshing within
10:14 - the same page but if I really went to a
10:16 - new page which like me went to the
10:17 - github home page yeah it's gonna go away
10:21 - hello there was a weird edit point there
10:24 - but I discovered something while making
10:26 - this video tutorial look how nicely this
10:28 - is working this is me on my Schiffman
10:30 - net website and i refresh the page and
10:33 - it works nicely it draws I close the
10:35 - console i refresh the page again it's
10:37 - not working anymore
10:38 - oh weird it's sort of worth so that's
10:42 - not working I don't know that it's
10:43 - working so here's the thing I think I
10:45 - got lucky
10:46 - remember earlier in this video I started
10:47 - rambling about this thing called
10:48 - instance mode well I think I got lucky
10:51 - in that V okay so a Content script by
10:57 - definition executes after the page has
11:00 - loaded
11:00 - but the page itself is not does not
11:06 - include the p5 library and the p5 these
11:09 - these I don't think the order of this
11:13 - really guarantees you much of anything
11:14 - could it could I put sketched a che s
11:17 - first let's just try this I really don't
11:19 - think so
11:20 - I think p5 what it's does what the p5
11:22 - library does is it looks for your setup
11:24 - and draw function and it that that
11:28 - sketch not J's file might not really
11:29 - like the content script might not be
11:31 - available when it's like loading the p5
11:32 - library and then something not finding
11:34 - the set of a draw function and
11:36 - everything so I might need to actually
11:37 - explicitly say like hey hello p5 here's
11:40 - my set up and draw functions which I'm
11:41 - going to show you how to do in a minute
11:42 - using something on instance mode unless
11:44 - this fixes the problem but really do you
11:46 - really think they load in that order in
11:47 - some way that's illogical but that
11:48 - doesn't make any sense because sketch
11:50 - would have to come after I can't load it
11:52 - first
11:52 - let's try so I'm gonna go to reload this
11:55 - extension reload I'm gonna hit refresh
12:00 - huh not working oh now it's not working
12:04 - at all oh now it is working it's the
12:06 - same thing I think I'm getting lucky
12:08 - sometimes and not cuz maybe I have
12:10 - things cache things over to ram or
12:11 - somebody much smarter than me we'll know
12:13 - detective but I I think I really want
12:15 - this to work I'm going to I'm going to
12:19 - go ahead and do what I think will work
12:21 - which is instance mode so what is
12:23 - instance mode I have a video tutorial
12:26 - about it it's a way of namespacing
12:29 - everything in your p5 sketch and kind of
12:31 - wrapping it into a function so what I'm
12:33 - going to do is I think I have to say
12:37 - let's look let's let's go to let's go to
12:41 - the p5.js wiki because you might as well
12:44 - know about this page which has a little
12:47 - tutorial about instance mode by the way
12:52 - sometimes oh I'm like killing okay first
12:55 - of all let's disable the extension and
12:59 - let's go to instance mode it's probably
13:04 - under I because I start global and
13:06 - instance mode so this webpage is going
13:08 - to explain this is global mode
13:09 - everything living in the global
13:11 - namespace this is instance mode
13:13 - I am going to just copy this over and
13:17 - I'm gonna I'm gonna probably change this
13:19 - to using let instead of R and that sort
13:21 - of thing but I'm basically going to take
13:23 - this out and I'm gonna put my code in
13:27 - there whoops and what I'm gonna do is
13:36 - put it in here and I'm gonna say how did
13:39 - that work I need to say sketch dot setup
13:41 - equals function I'll try to explain a
13:43 - little bit more about this and sketch
13:49 - dot draw equals function and then
13:53 - everything that's a p5 function I just
13:55 - say sketch dot so sketched out create
13:57 - canvas sketched out clear sketch dot
14:02 - stroke sketched out screw stroke weight
14:04 - if sketch mouse is pressed sketched out
14:08 - Mouse X sketched out Mouse Y sketched
14:11 - out P Mouse X sketched out P Mouse Y and
14:16 - then this is fine so this is just now
14:20 - this is actually instantiating the p5
14:23 - sketch of getting some more
14:30 - these are injected in the order they
14:31 - appear in the array so from breaking
14:33 - news from the Chrome extension API this
14:36 - order actually does matter they are
14:39 - injected in into the script in the order
14:42 - that they're in the array so let's do
14:43 - this I think sketch touches should be
14:45 - last and now what I'm going to do is
14:51 - this should be exactly the same now this
14:54 - is instance mode it's the same exact
14:56 - sketch but I've so let me explain a
14:58 - little bit what's going on here what I'm
14:59 - doing is I'm saying I want to make I
15:02 - want to make a new P 5 thing and so
15:06 - normally this happens automatically the
15:08 - p5 library starts to make its own P 5
15:10 - thing by looking for your global setup
15:12 - and draw but here I'm saying I'm gonna
15:14 - make this wrapper function and it's
15:16 - going to have setup attached to it and
15:19 - draw attached to it and this whole thing
15:21 - is the thing you can make the p5 sketch
15:23 - from a bit more to it that you can read
15:25 - the wiki page but that's the basic guide
15:27 - yeah let's see if this works I'm sure I
15:31 - made some mistakes
15:32 - Oh window with is that's a p5 variable
15:36 - so sketch that window with I think I'm
15:38 - gonna have to say all right let's see
15:41 - what happens here so one thing I want to
15:42 - do by the way is I'm gonna just change
15:44 - this to I want to change this to sketch
15:49 - dot window height again just so it's
15:51 - just so it's only covering part of the
15:53 - page because that really just slow it
15:55 - down if it tries to make a sketch a
15:57 - canvas the size of the whole body
15:59 - alright so let's now reload the
16:02 - extension enable the extension reload
16:07 - the extension and refresh the page
16:11 - paint hold on refresh the page uncaught
16:17 - reference this line is not defined
16:20 - sketched outline thank you very much so
16:23 - it's very easy it's kind of like
16:24 - forgetting this dot I kind of have
16:26 - sketched out for everything that's p5 so
16:29 - I'm going to reload the extension again
16:32 - I'm gonna come back here hit refresh
16:36 - there we go
16:37 - this works hit refresh again it works
16:41 - I'm gonna get rid of the console so now
16:44 - it's working consistently no matter what
16:46 - I do let's make one more thing a little
16:48 - nicer about this notice how I keep
16:50 - selecting the text box in it while I'm
16:52 - drawing out cuz the chat gave me some
16:56 - code to do that I see it now I can
16:59 - change I can affect the CSS of the
17:05 - entire body and set the user select
17:08 - property to none so user selects the
17:10 - property meaning making something
17:11 - available to be selected and so what I'm
17:14 - gonna do here in setup is I'm going to
17:15 - say document dot body dot style right
17:19 - dot user select equals none so and I
17:25 - kinda I don't know why but I have this
17:27 - like habit of doing this because a lot
17:29 - of the CSS properties are not valid
17:33 - keywords that you can just say dot like
17:35 - background - color you wouldn't be able
17:37 - to say style dot background - color but
17:40 - so you can
17:41 - user-selected work because it's like a
17:42 - valium variable name so let's try adding
17:44 - this see if that's in the right place
17:46 - I'm going to reload the extension
17:51 - refresh and now there I am drawing it's
17:54 - not selecting the text I can still click
17:56 - on the links I can go over here I can
17:59 - draw on here and then I can also because
18:02 - I can also enable my chrome kitten
18:06 - extension I can go to this web page and
18:08 - I can draw oh I can draw books I can
18:11 - draw I can draw on the kittens yay I
18:16 - love you
18:17 - kitten oh you're a star kitten rainbow
18:22 - okay oh are you still watching this
18:27 - video because I'm just gonna be here
18:28 - doodling on this web page for a while
18:30 - okay so I'm gonna leave it here I did
18:34 - show you how you could actually create
18:36 - the canvas to be taller with
18:39 - document.body that client height one
18:42 - other suggestion from Austin and the
18:45 - chat said I could start with no loop and
18:47 - only render when I'm actually drawing
18:50 - that'll actually really help with
18:51 - performance as well of course there was
18:53 - another suggestion being like well if
18:54 - you just used SVG's nor have this giant
18:56 - canvas that's probably a much smarter
18:58 - idea but the point is I'm showing you
19:00 - how you can have a canvas overlay with
19:03 - p5 and load P 5 P 5 library and by the
19:09 - way you can load other libraries the
19:10 - same exact way whether you want to use
19:11 - jQuery or 3GS or anything this is the
19:14 - same exact way so I hope you enjoyed
19:16 - this coding challenge about creating a
19:18 - canvas overlay p5 sketch in a Chrome
19:22 - extension content script if you made it
19:25 - through this whole video MA
19:26 - thank you something good bye
