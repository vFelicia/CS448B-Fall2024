00:00 - okay Here I am live at the ITP show
00:04 - people are looking at me like I'm a
00:05 - crazy person which I am it's quite
00:07 - understandable this is the ITP winter
00:10 - show 2017 my name is Dan Schiffman this
00:14 - is hey there's nobody you're watching
00:18 - which is a little strange is this
00:20 - actually happening are people there I
00:25 - see a lot of thumbs up okay great
00:27 - alright so this is a somewhat of a
00:30 - special episode but this is the end of
00:32 - semester show at ITP it's a two-year
00:35 - graduate program at Tisch School of the
00:36 - Arts and I'm here on the floor there's
00:39 - over a hundred projects on display and
00:41 - I'm just gonna wander around and look at
00:43 - them and interview various students and
00:46 - I set my notifications to never turn on
00:49 - and they're turning on anyway okay
00:50 - that's fine they're going away one
00:53 - question I have while people are
00:54 - watching just briefly is if the audio
00:56 - sort of seems okay and if you can if you
01:02 - can hear me just fine
01:06 - great alright awesome so I'm gonna turn
01:10 - that I'm gonna press some button that's
01:11 - gonna change the view of the camera okay
01:16 - so this is the ITP floor now you can
01:18 - hear me and I'm going to go into this
01:21 - room first okay we're gonna look at some
01:25 - projects in this room let's go I'm gonna
01:27 - come over here first since this I think
01:29 - will show up very nicely on the camera
01:30 - okay so what I'm gonna ask you guys to
01:32 - do they're my guinea pigs here is to say
01:35 - your name wait hold on I'm trying to
01:37 - like get used to this gimbal thing oh
01:39 - it's backwards okay oh you know what
01:41 - you're very much in the shadows because
01:42 - of so yeah just stand about there that's
01:45 - a little bit better I mean it's gonna be
01:46 - dark no matter what
01:51 - that's better maybe maybe that's better
01:53 - now alright okay so alright now I'm
02:01 - gonna ask you say your name and then
02:03 - tell me about your project and I'm gonna
02:05 - do it this is a little bit differently
02:06 - than I did last time because I learned
02:07 - it's actually helpful when if I edit
02:09 - this later to have video of the people
02:11 - talking and then the projects work
02:13 - separately and they can be spliced
02:14 - together okay
02:17 - I'm Michael Simpson observe the light
02:26 - and they reproduce the imaging on the
02:28 - other side so how he made this is a 3d
02:31 - printed object and fabricated using
02:35 - fiber optics so this gets this gets this
02:39 - image from the bottom and then
02:41 - reproducing the image on the front you
02:45 - can see like people love to doing this
02:47 - it doesn't involve any electricity but
02:52 - it still is growing and showing the
02:54 - image that right there is a projector
02:57 - inside and it's emitting the lights and
03:01 - on the display we have we decided we
03:05 - wanted to try to make it look like it
03:06 - was a living object so we were thinking
03:08 - about different things and we decided to
03:10 - use visualization of a neural network
03:12 - that's trying to find the solution space
03:15 - of X or so every two minutes and resets
03:18 - and it thinks about it for a little bit
03:19 - and you kind of watch it breathing and
03:21 - thinking and trying to find the solution
03:23 - had you worked with this kind of fiber
03:26 - optics before research before to find
03:33 - like how to fabricate this and at first
03:36 - like this star is this this is just a
03:38 - one pixel and you can see that when it's
03:41 - getting
03:48 - it's bending the light and yet decided
03:51 - to make it into a bigger light sculpture
03:56 - awesome wonderful thank you guys okay
03:59 - well I'm just gonna test to make sure
04:01 - this microphone is really working okay
04:03 - so I'm holding the microphone near my
04:05 - mouth near my mouth okay so hold on I
04:21 - gotta figure out how to do this if I
04:22 - turn this here okay look at it it's like
04:25 - falling to the side Oh thing is supposed
04:29 - to make give me a stable camera and yet
04:30 - it just seems to cause any more problems
04:32 - okay we're gonna go over here and tell
04:36 - me your name and about your project
04:39 - [Music]
04:40 - information from two people and
04:43 - encourages you to sync your heart rate
04:45 - with somebody else
04:47 - let's take a look you need somebody else
04:51 - to either hold the camera can we get a
04:53 - volunteer
05:10 - so once it gets a good pulse from each
05:14 - person it's going to compare their heart
05:16 - rates and then we can try to sync how
05:33 - has the response been like what if
05:34 - people tried to do right away they
05:40 - usually try to start deep breathing
05:42 - together and sometimes they'll hold
05:44 - hands I've had people try to sing
05:46 - together or listen to music yesterday
05:48 - people were running in plays so
05:50 - unprompted they will engage in all sorts
05:52 - of different strategies to try to sync
05:54 - up with somebody
05:55 - awesome combos I try to get some more
05:57 - footage of this here and are you
06:00 - adjusting the color awesome cool and
06:12 - everybody always wants to know even
06:14 - though I don't like to ask technical
06:15 - questions what you use to build this
06:28 - awesome
06:44 - all right cool awesome great job tell
06:55 - them can I ask you about this project
06:56 - okay so tell me your name and tell me
06:59 - about your project
07:01 - [Music]
07:05 - yeah you know I think I need to do this
07:07 - hold on I think I'm just gonna be better
07:13 - [Music]
07:17 - which is called flappy shadow yeah yeah
07:30 - maybe what I need to do is actually this
07:32 - and then that okay that's probably
07:33 - better okay let's try this one more time
07:37 - [Music]
07:44 - can you demonstrate it for us
08:16 - I just laughed really awkwardly and
08:21 - loudly
08:36 - yeah yeah awesome great job thank you
08:52 - okay you guys want to demonstrate some
08:54 - flying calibrate this hold on Wow okay
09:08 - so let's have a look here
09:11 - Chang Tao is putting on some wings and
09:17 - before you start um can you guys tell me
09:20 - your names and a little bit about your
09:23 - project but you need to talk right to
09:24 - this hi my name is chen tao we just have
09:31 - this summation of wings I love space so
09:34 - we have this silly idea of just
09:36 - combining idea of letting a man flying
09:39 - through space using wings and that here
09:42 - is appreciate the physicality of the
09:48 - wings so I love putting a young and when
09:51 - they're interacting it's really like
09:53 - tangible I guess yeah awesome okay I'm
09:57 - gonna step over here and I'm gonna try
10:00 - to get you guys
10:17 - this looks a lot like a star-filled
10:20 - coding challenge that I thought I might
10:22 - recognize what has kind of what has the
10:32 - reaction been like people said to you
10:36 - that was surprising or what people done
10:37 - anything you would expect it was like
10:46 - really really cool and they love to fly
10:48 - like awesome fantastic alright great job
11:01 - you guys thank you
11:03 - I see if I oh you know what let's see we
11:08 - try there's different settings no sound
11:13 - let's see if this helps
11:15 - yes sound okay I think actually uh I
11:18 - think I found a better setting for the
11:21 - gimbal thing
11:28 - all right we're walking down this
11:30 - hallway there's some pretty awesome
11:32 - projects here this is a really great
11:34 - game called darkness that I played
11:35 - yesterday but it's not actually here
11:38 - right now Stephanie want to show your
11:42 - project spoiler alert I said her name
11:44 - already
11:45 - okay ready say your name and tell me
11:47 - about your project
11:49 - I did a project called take me to which
11:54 - is a sort of couples trace routing IP
11:56 - addresses with Google Streetview
11:58 - so I'll use p5.js org is our website and
12:01 - we'll see it go through the different
12:04 - locations
12:13 - okay all right so I picked our website
12:15 - and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
12:17 - right now it's thinking and looking up
12:19 - all the intermediate IP address hops
12:22 - that we make from our network here at
12:24 - NYU to p5.js org and so what we saw are
12:28 - the Street View locations of all of
12:31 - those organizations that have those
12:33 - intermediate IP addresses register so on
12:36 - the way we had talked about
12:38 - communications in Virginia but also in
12:41 - New York we hit Zao bandwidth and then
12:45 - we also finally then ended up at new
12:47 - dream network in California which is
12:49 - where p5 org p5.js dorgon's registered
12:54 - awesome what what what interesting
12:56 - websites that people put in here that
12:58 - surprised you see is interesting it just
13:02 - goes to Chicago I think and what else is
13:07 - interesting and why you dot e-d-u I
13:09 - couldn't trace wrote because we're
13:10 - already on the network I think so that
13:13 - was kind of a revelation they always
13:16 - like Lee goes through two locations
13:17 - either Broomfield California for level
13:19 - three or 60 Hudson in New York for Tata
13:22 - Communications awesome great job thank
13:25 - you
13:28 - your project okay folks holding this mic
13:33 - is very sensitive just more than last
13:35 - year when I do this you really ought to
13:36 - talk right hi I'm Chris I'm a second
13:39 - year student in ITP and this is my
13:41 - project this is basically an app you can
13:44 - use to so this is an app you can use to
13:55 - select the video okay we're going cool
14:08 - so you can upload any video in this case
14:11 - I'm uploading this video of food which
14:15 - is like five seconds and this app will
14:17 - first grab all the frames and analyze
14:19 - the video and it will try to get a
14:21 - description of what's in the video so it
14:24 - took like five seconds for it to do this
14:26 - and after that you'll see that here it
14:28 - pop-ups like a small description of what
14:30 - is in the video and with that you can
14:34 - select any 3d train movie from here
14:39 - so if I go like with Rosemary's Baby
14:41 - from Roman Polanski this is gonna search
14:44 - for the scene that best matches that
14:46 - previous video you input so you get a
14:48 - thing like that it's basically a tool
14:51 - that uses machine learning to analyze
14:53 - videos and like get this similarity
14:55 - between videos and things well that's
14:59 - really cool
15:00 - how how how long are the clips like how
15:05 - do you determine this sort of start and
15:07 - end time of the clips that were seeing
15:10 - in this search so I search the tools
15:14 - search for the the longest scene in a
15:17 - movie I'm basically analyzing all the
15:18 - frames and the frames that have the same
15:20 - description basically I I can infer that
15:23 - that's a scene but I thinks that most
15:26 - scenes in like movies are like four to
15:28 - eight seconds long because they're
15:30 - really like fast but I still like
15:33 - grabbing the the one that's the longest
15:35 - so in average eight scene is like five
15:37 - seconds
15:38 - to five to seven seconds so this is so
15:43 - this we have a bowl of food sitting on a
15:45 - table and then now we have a man sitting
15:49 - at a table with a plate of food from
15:51 - Star Wars
15:51 - a new hope I hope I'm not violating any
15:53 - copyright it's a short enough clip that
15:58 - we're okay we can do another and
16:01 - basically that's how it works
16:03 - so get something like that awesome what
16:07 - are you using a pre-trained model that
16:11 - do the kind of to to come up with this
16:14 - sentence or caption for the video or is
16:17 - that something you trained like hot
16:18 - what's what's the kind of happening
16:19 - behind the scenes there oh yeah I'm
16:21 - using a picturing model Google released
16:23 - a couple months ago it's called image to
16:25 - text and I'm using that in a frame to
16:28 - frame basis and then I'm pretty trendy
16:31 - all these movies pre-training a move
16:33 - aside like training a movie takes like
16:36 - an hour for like a two hour movie so I
16:38 - basically had like my computer running
16:40 - for a week just like watching movies you
16:42 - know awesome cool great job thank you
16:46 - Chris okay here we go we are now
16:52 - entering the fray here
16:55 - okay wait there's a crazy thing over
16:57 - here oh okay wait are we ready for
17:00 - rock-paper-scissors or not yet should I
17:02 - come all right hold on Oh coming back
17:06 - over here okay so what I'm gonna try to
17:07 - do this microphone is very sensitive I
17:09 - mean it's not sensitive it's like it
17:11 - will only hear you so I'm gonna have you
17:13 - just talk about the project for a little
17:14 - bit then I'll should come shoot some
17:15 - video of it in action okay some of your
17:18 - name and about cool hey my name
17:24 - okay hey my name is Nick Wallace this is
17:28 - the hand so this is a project that I've
17:30 - been working on for the our physical
17:32 - computing midterm and final and it
17:35 - started off as a simple kind of game
17:37 - idea we realized so here at ITP we have
17:39 - a large kind of very diverse community
17:41 - and we were talking about games that
17:44 - everybody has played is the child that
17:46 - kind of thing and it turns out almost
17:47 - everybody has played rock-paper-scissors
17:49 - at some point in their life they might
17:51 - not call it exactly rock paper scissors
17:53 - paper scissors rock whatever but it
17:55 - turned out to a very common thing so we
17:57 - wanted to do something where you were
17:58 - playing with a computer in a way that
18:00 - was kind of universal to a lot of
18:02 - people's experience so we started off
18:05 - with his idea rock paper scissors and
18:06 - then we figured rather than having it up
18:08 - on a screen why not create a hand that
18:11 - hat plays rock paper scissors and so we
18:13 - did okay let's watch rock paper scissors
18:17 - all right so now they won't really be
18:18 - able to hear you but okay sure yes
18:25 - waking him up right now oh there we go
18:28 - he's going he's throwing rock oh I got
18:34 - him
18:38 - got him again
18:45 - so now he's gonna resubmit himself
18:46 - because we just played three games yeah
18:49 - so he plays rock-paper-scissors who
18:50 - played best two of three and we've got
18:52 - some little motion input here and this
18:55 - guy right here just showing what you're
18:57 - doing as the player and he's so he's
18:59 - inviting me to play again and so we're
19:01 - gonna go home we're game why not and
19:02 - he's also kind of rude really cool so
19:14 - this is uh this is the Heron has anybody
19:17 - been really good at playing and always
19:18 - beats seems to somehow managed to beat
19:20 - the ham yeah so we had one guy yesterday
19:22 - who I think won probably five out of six
19:24 - games is the best that I've seen so far
19:25 - most people don't do don't do quite as
19:28 - well I definitely don't even I made him
19:30 - and I still lose every time almost
19:31 - awesome great project thank you okay
19:36 - this is what I wanted to show you guys
19:37 - this is brickbreaker
19:39 - but somehow being played I got to
19:43 - recalibrate this gimbal
20:19 - all right can you guys tell me about
20:20 - your project so tell me your name right
20:23 - in the mic and tell me this is our
20:31 - seesaw project it's an interactive
20:34 - seesaw playing game combining are very
20:38 - familiar games of seesaw and break
20:40 - breaker so we are actually using a
20:42 - seesaw to control the breaker game and
20:46 - actually our concept is that we want to
20:49 - give a chance for adults to do what they
20:52 - did in their childhood but they don't do
20:55 - when they grow up so and also our
20:58 - project gave a chance for two people
21:01 - maybe who are strangers or who don't
21:03 - know each other very well a chance to
21:05 - sit together play together talk to each
21:07 - other awesome has anybody really
21:10 - surprised you I liked how they played it
21:12 - in a way you didn't expect or somebody
21:14 - like really really good at it
21:15 - mostly kids they're really persistent
21:18 - and they really want to win and they
21:20 - came barely around seventy six times and
21:23 - they are the highest score right now
21:25 - very competitive and really into the
21:28 - game awesome great job you guys I'm
21:31 - gonna try to get some more footage of it
21:39 - it's okay you're going front
21:55 - all right hold on maybe Oren can be can
21:58 - I can I can I try to get your project
22:00 - Warren is testing it okay so let me why
22:03 - don't why don't I get some shots of him
22:05 - doing it and then then I'll ask you guys
22:08 - can get him an explanation about it
23:11 - it's okay came out great actually
23:13 - alright can I can I save save save okay
23:18 - hold on okay can I can I have you guys
23:29 - just say your name and give a couple
23:30 - minutes or you a minute explanation okay
23:33 - hold on let me get this camera in a good
23:35 - spot okay here we go ready I'm Johnny
23:41 - hurry unction project wish candles and
23:46 - it's all about making your wishes
23:50 - blowing out the candles so as fast we
23:53 - just thought about turning of LED light
23:56 - flowing by blowing out but later we
24:01 - decide to decided to apply a story you
24:05 - know the blowing out the candles making
24:08 - your wishes on your bus birthday it's
24:10 - kind of international myth so we applied
24:14 - the story on our project and then we
24:17 - also want you to add some kind of analog
24:20 - interaction on it so we also made
24:23 - electronic electronic match that you can
24:26 - turn it on by striking it on the
24:29 - matchbox
24:29 - three and they're safe and we didn't
24:33 - want to go too literal by having like a
24:36 - little birthday singing on the screen so
24:38 - we combined it with another myth of
24:40 - making your wish when shooting stars go
24:43 - down from the sky so that's why we had
24:45 - the night sky on the screen and when you
24:48 - blow out the candles the shooting star
24:50 - animation is triggered and also we
24:53 - didn't want to make our whole project
24:54 - tacky or cheesy so we went for like a
24:57 - really chic black concept and that's why
25:01 - we have the walls all black yeah that's
25:05 - our general concept wonderful fantastic
25:08 - great work you guys thanks for showing
25:10 - it
25:17 - okay I think I got really good footage
25:20 - of it so
26:04 - okay so everybody can go and see that on
26:06 - Twitter now yes awesome great job thank
26:08 - you
26:47 - alright I'm gonna keep moving okay can
26:51 - you tell me about these sure these are
26:56 - some of my first tell me your name for
26:57 - hi I'm on the table and for digital
27:00 - fabrication I did some experiments and
27:02 - concrete so for example if you look at
27:05 - this disk of concrete there's nothing
27:07 - too special about it but it has embedded
27:09 - fiber optics which allow light to shine
27:13 - through so I made these light sculptures
27:18 - using the same technique I also
27:20 - discovered the concrete is slightly
27:22 - conductive
27:23 - so I was able to make a touch-sensitive
27:25 - concrete lamp the base is all concrete
27:29 - with some embedded electronics these are
27:33 - some magnetic sculptures kind of similar
27:36 - to a ferrofluid
27:37 - but captured in solid form and I'm
27:44 - playing around with basically the
27:46 - tactile feel of like rough concrete with
27:49 - this fragile looking form and then over
27:53 - there we have some what I call revealed
27:55 - light sculptures where I take light
27:57 - sculptures and embed them inside
27:59 - concrete then as you chisel away the
28:01 - concrete the light shines through and it
28:03 - guides you how to chisel and revealing
28:07 - the structure at the end wonderful
28:09 - where'd you get the idea to do this I
28:11 - started out with the concept of smart
28:13 - walls and trying to make you know
28:17 - basically for example buttons which
28:19 - would be embedded inside the walls and
28:21 - just decide figure out that I love the
28:24 - concrete as a substance and exploded
28:27 - awesome I'm gonna try to get some more
28:29 - close-up footage of it sir
28:46 - can you touch the lamp again let me just
28:51 - come around this side do it yeah oh wow
28:55 - awesome cool that's beautiful
29:02 - so this ugly looking thing is actually a
29:05 - very smart block of concrete and it has
29:08 - embedded sensors which allow me to make
29:11 - a real-time 3d rendering of the shape
29:14 - that you're sculpting as you're
29:15 - sculpting it so today at 6:00 I'm gonna
29:18 - take a hammer and chisel do it and
29:20 - you'll see wonderful great job should I
29:25 - come check this out okay so it is a
29:33 - whole class project yes they'll tell me
29:35 - your name and this is all of the
29:40 - projects from the digital fabrication
29:42 - class somebody made contour table out
29:47 - from the CNC so basically use the CNC
29:49 - has a painting tool dan tried making us
29:54 - your trophy like laser cut acrylic so it

30:33 - get some footage of them could you do
30:35 - the same things to interact say with
30:36 - this one yeah
30:48 - and what's causing it to change color
30:50 - whenever a message comes in the
30:54 - basically there's at will you up running
30:57 - that basically changes colors based on
31:01 - now
31:02 - whether it's received a message

31:23 - let's see alright Simon can you tell me
31:27 - your name and tell me about your project

31:32 - because this microphone only hear you if
31:34 - you talk right
31:34 - yeah I'm Simon and this over here is my
31:38 - ICM project our coding project called
31:40 - take the money and run so basically what
31:43 - it does it is lets you create it you're
31:46 - travelling self and you can follow
31:48 - yourself by getting postcards from all
31:50 - over the world and that's basically what
31:52 - it is awesome can you demonstrate it
31:56 - alright someone's look using it right

32:55 - we're in Los Angeles so it's taking
32:58 - images from Flickr put you on top and
33:01 - then it fills in some blanks in the
33:03 - postcards from JSON files wonderful
33:09 - awesome job thank you
33:16 - okay let's see yeah this is this
33:19 - requires a lot of arm strength
33:21 - good thing I holding the camera with my
33:24 - non broken arm alright can you
33:27 - demonstrate this or Foe first tell me
33:29 - your name and tell me about your project
33:30 - my name is and this project is called
33:34 - the cosmos in the water okay tell me
33:38 - what it does all the way you should just
33:39 - show it first
33:44 - [Music]
34:07 - Wow where'd you get this idea
34:12 - this project is actually a meditation
34:14 - it's it's like there is young I am
34:18 - patent you can see from the water so
34:21 - it's about Taoism so I want people well
34:24 - they are interacting with the water they
34:26 - can feeling their relationship with
34:28 - nature so are we part of the nature or
34:31 - are we isolated from it do we want to
34:33 - control it or do we want to achieve
34:35 - balance so this project is about these
34:38 - things that I want people to think while
34:40 - they are playing with it all right hey I
34:48 - recognize you from a different project
34:51 - okay tell me your name and tell me about
34:54 - your project my name is Oren shoham my
34:57 - project is a glove that is a wearable
34:59 - MIDI controller so the way it works is
35:02 - it's got a bunch of force sensors and
35:04 - the fingertips so when you press a
35:06 - finger it sends a musical MIDI note to
35:10 - either a computer or to a phone any
35:12 - device that can do blue suit MIDI over
35:14 - Bluetooth so right now I've got hooked
35:16 - up to able to live over here controlling
35:18 - a drum sound which you can't hear the
35:21 - sound of my headphone but
35:26 - people hear that well anyway yeah so it
35:41 - works entirely wirelessly it's got a
35:42 - battery and it communicates have a
35:45 - bluetooth so it's entirely portable I
35:48 - just have a bunch of wires on it right
35:49 - now but it once in the future awesome
35:54 - thank you so much okay Elizabeth can you
36:00 - tell me your name even though I just
36:01 - said what your name is and then what not
36:03 - yet about your project and this is my
36:10 - lingo gizmo which I'll show you you can
36:12 - use it to invent words for a missing
36:14 - dictionary great okay so I'm it's a
36:17 - little bit tricky but I'm gonna try to
36:18 - shoot you doing it while you okay like
36:42 - the word sound you can add it to your
36:45 - growing word have enough so let's define
36:52 - it Dan what do you think Pavano means
36:55 - paavana is the state of feeling totally
36:58 - relaxed
37:03 - let's spell it paavana and then we need
37:08 - to shout it into the microphone so that
37:10 - it grabs it so paavana give your name
37:17 - and then save so the idea is that you're
37:21 - adding original words to a missing
37:24 - dictionary and people can collaborate on
37:26 - adding those for experiences that don't
37:29 - have words yet so this is my working
37:30 - prototype for now awesome what's your
37:33 - favorite word that someone's made up so
37:35 - far if that's just an example of one
37:36 - that you like the word which is the name
37:41 - for doing homework late at night and
37:43 - having a small party awesome great job

48:51 - your name and tell me about your project
48:54 - my name is Alden and
48:56 - I bought this doll from a witch on eBay
49:00 - and the witch told me that the ghost of
49:02 - a young girl named Sophia is trapped
49:04 - inside of the doll and so what I did is
49:07 - I used the Google Cloud speech API in
49:10 - order to connect with the ghost and
49:12 - allow you to commune commune with her
49:14 - and but for some reason all she wants to
49:17 - do is tell you about your future so if
49:20 - you not hold this microphone me to tell
50:10 - me about my me to tell
50:51 - yes I see some people in the comments
50:54 - take talking about how bad I am with
50:57 - this gimbal and yeah it's true I think
51:01 - there's this unfortunate issue where
51:02 - it's weighted poorly mostly because I
51:05 - had to tether this microphone to it I
51:07 - also realized that I'm kind of doing a
51:10 - well that's a much better
51:11 - this is hold on let's look at someone
51:13 - who knows what they're doing here you
51:17 - guys I don't know if this is live right
51:19 - now but you should definitely tune into
51:21 - this because they know what they're
51:23 - doing it's much better okay I'm gonna go
51:27 - around here okay hold on let's try let's
51:29 - let's just keep going let's try some of
51:30 - this stuff hey wait
51:31 - didn't we just talk to you about a
51:32 - project yeah I have two projects in here
51:36 - I'm allowed to talk to the same person
51:38 - twice yeah this is a critique to news
51:42 - media and we are bombarded by so much
51:44 - sub by so many things so much that if
51:47 - you actually come close and try to see
51:49 - what it's about well I can tell you
51:59 - there we actually see that it's only a
52:03 - bunch of noise there's no content behind
52:06 - it it's only designed to make us to
52:09 - attract us and to grab our attention and
52:12 - also the closing is a critic to the news
52:14 - media companies because most of them
52:16 - with the critiques they just shut
52:19 - themselves they don't listen to anything
52:20 - at all and then they just go to what
52:23 - what they were doing in the first place
52:25 - great job thank you okay I think we're
52:28 - gonna think that's good see if we can
52:29 - make this work here for a live streaming
52:31 - audience is that okay with you
52:33 - okay first but first before you
52:35 - demonstrate it many go demonstrate if
52:37 - you demonstrate first well why don't you
52:38 - just tell me your name and tell me a
52:39 - couple cents about the brother
52:41 - so my name is al Rosenberg I mean I made
52:43 - a toy drum machine all made out of wood
52:46 - and yeah so I as you see I am I'm
52:50 - flourishing when it's what I'm going
52:52 - live let's let's take a look at it
53:05 - it has demo itis this is worth the wait
53:13 - everybody
53:33 - [Music]
54:10 - [Music]
54:24 - [Music]
54:33 - does anybody really surprised you and
54:35 - how they use this in a way that you
54:36 - didn't expect yes some people try to use
54:40 - this guy and mostly kids just put every
54:54 - possible magnet on the board so what
54:56 - happens if you do that yeah it just goes
55:00 - berserk but yeah can you just brief can
55:04 - you briefly explain what the dials at
55:05 - the bottom yes this one the left one is
55:09 - youth like controlling the tempo so lets
55:13 - you know if you can hear it and the
55:22 - right one is just
55:23 - [Music]
55:33 - awesome great job thank you okay let's
55:37 - see
55:38 - you guys wanna can you guys come and
55:39 - tell me your names and tell me about
55:41 - your project I'm Shawn I'm you ha
55:49 - this approach is like a magic sandbox
55:52 - you can play with the sand and animation
55:55 - wheel changes along with it
55:58 - so that's the music do you want to see
56:00 - this yeah so hold on give me a second
56:04 - here to get set up okay go for it
56:27 - I've heard the music to hear it
56:37 - beautiful job great job guys thank you
56:40 - okay oh boy so many things to see
56:48 - oh yeah okay wait hold on Chelsea can I
56:52 - ask you to explain your project and then
56:54 - let's see if we can somehow maybe
56:56 - demonstrate it first tell me your name
57:00 - and tell me why my name is Virgil is
57:03 - made by me and my partner yelling and
57:06 - this is an installation project with
57:09 - links for stampers with my Gmail API so
57:12 - basically you're watching is my email
57:15 - stress level so every time I got new
57:18 - email stepwells being a little bit if I
57:22 - keep knowing this email spell things
57:25 - will happen for example low-wing was
57:27 - filled all righty and now we are on the
57:30 - stage too so I'm guessing maybe trending
57:33 - more emails below will be popped and I
57:35 - wish you have stage three so it's a play
57:40 - so the arm will push all the play on the
57:44 - floor then I smash it and you have to
57:47 - clean the mess and the fourth one is AG
57:49 - so I say you can see and is alive right
57:52 - it can be a chicken so you don't want to
57:54 - kill a live radio email okay let me try
57:58 - to get some footage of it and then so so
58:01 - if for people who are watching live or
58:04 - what's going to happen here let me try
58:06 - to come over here so that me will come
58:15 - back come back
58:35 - I think the battery is I'm I'm gonna
58:43 - have to get put new batteries in this
58:45 - but it's okay I'm gonna take it off he's
58:47 - going to make people so happy anyway
59:04 - okay
59:19 - I'm reading it the stepper will you know
59:22 - swing reversely and NATO will come back
59:25 - a little bit let's try it again
59:28 - sending yes and reading so you better
59:38 - read all your emails yes all right let's
59:40 - try to look so this is spilling ink this
59:45 - is knocking a plate off the table and
59:49 - then over here is smashing the egg okay
60:01 - I'm gonna go try to revive this all
60:03 - right everybody
60:07 - if nobody minds I'm gonna try to revive
60:12 - the gimbal oops I'm gonna sneak by
60:21 - revive the gimbal take a short break for
60:24 - a second okay hello everybody I'm not
60:38 - taking a seat here this is very very
60:40 - exhausting to do this okay I'm gonna put
60:44 - this mic here
60:59 - what supposedly our two fully charged
61:03 - I'm gonna go see some more projects I
61:16 - don't feel like unplugging the mic
61:18 - because I don't feel like I'm plugging
61:20 - the mic because then I don't have to
61:22 - plug it back in
61:24 - I'm gonna go look at some more projects
61:26 - in a minute although I think I did
61:29 - pretty well
61:39 - this goes in this way you know the the
61:46 - gimbal isn't doing very much where I
61:47 - should use is just like a stick to hold
61:49 - the phone that would actually be better
61:51 - no I'm just being lazy as soon as I as
61:54 - soon as the holidays come up getting a
61:56 - haircut and a trimming a beard it's just
62:02 - okay
62:06 - YouTube has stabilization it's pretty
62:08 - awful the YouTube stabilization all
62:10 - right let's see I don't think it's
62:20 - supposed to do this
62:21 - I make horrible sound
62:32 - I dunno how to calibrate it okay I know
62:39 - I understand about the mic I'm sorry
62:42 - about that another time I'll try to get
62:43 - a better one I realize it's very
62:46 - directional the good thing about that is
62:48 - it's very very loud out there and so
62:51 - it's so loud that if I didn't have a
62:54 - good directional mic I don't think you
62:55 - better hear anything let me look at the
63:18 - instructions sorry everybody these are
63:25 - the instructions for the SK lab gimbal
63:33 - this show is open to the public but you
63:35 - only got about three hours left so if
63:38 - you're in New York and can make it here
63:39 - then you could come okay it says too so
63:46 - I am using the counterweight pitch lock
63:50 - panning and roll axis can move freely
63:52 - but the pitch axis stays in a fixed
63:54 - position power button will flash one
63:56 - time all right I think that's the mode
63:58 - that I want starting up hold the phone
64:00 - in a horizontal position with the camera
64:03 - facing away from you figure five press
64:06 - the power button for incorrectly three
64:07 - seconds the gimbal will automatically
64:09 - balance itself do not attempt to move
64:11 - the gimbal motors by hand
64:12 - oops the gimbal is not balanced see the
64:14 - calibration section of the manual okay
64:20 - calibration simply power off the gimbal
64:23 - for about one minute and let it rest on
64:25 - a flat surface power back on see if is
64:28 - successfully cobbler ated okay i did
64:29 - that i think because i have the
64:37 - counterweight in it really needs the
64:40 - phone in there okay I am gonna unplug
64:48 - the mic I'm afraid to do that so now
64:53 - it's just using the phone mic
65:01 - because what I'm gonna do is actually do
65:03 - the actual real-life correct calibration
65:12 - then I'll plug the mic back in okay so
65:16 - I'm gonna do this second calibration I
65:22 - can try without the directional mic even
65:25 - in the hallway but I don't think that's
65:26 - gonna work where it's really noisy all
65:30 - right so now I'm gonna attempt to do
65:32 - figure six so all right all right
65:39 - everyone sing this sounds so much better
65:41 - so figure six okay
65:44 - simply power off the okay with a phone
65:46 - installing the gimbal powered on press
65:47 - in the joystick but both buttons until
65:49 - the motor deactivate and the power light
65:51 - begins flashing oh the kid blasting
65:59 - powered on
66:00 - okay PMO's powered on
66:11 - motor turned off next lay the gimbal
66:14 - down a flat surface resting its pitch
66:16 - axis and handle figure six okay
66:32 - oh it just calibrated awesome
66:54 - there we go ooh it's totally calibrated
66:57 - now so actually it's totally calibrated
67:04 - and so you if you want I can go into the
67:10 - hallway and see how it works without the
67:12 - mic but I kind of feel feeling that's
67:13 - gonna be a disaster let's just try that
67:15 - for a little bit I'll come back okay so
67:21 - I got to switch the camera all right
67:30 - [Music]
67:35 - wait this is live streaming me finding a
67:38 - whiteboard marker and handing it off
67:41 - yeah excellent
67:43 - morning trade continues yeah okay now
67:46 - what I'm trying to do with no microphone
67:48 - no listen you want to be a guinea pig
67:50 - here okay so we're gonna trying this
67:52 - without I had a directional mic yes
67:54 - we're complaining about so this is
67:56 - probably gonna be worse okay people are
67:58 - saying this is bad
67:59 - okay well let's let's give you I'll come
68:00 - back with you - sure so tell me your
68:02 - name - tell me about your project my
68:03 - name is Melissa and my project is called
68:06 - swipe right it's a web app to make it
68:09 - easier to report Twitter Nazis so can we
68:14 - can we report somebody right now yeah we
68:16 - can report someone I'm let's find
68:18 - someone who is very worth recording
68:20 - let's see unlike these ultra-orthodox
68:23 - Jews sort of a lion I'm not sure
68:26 - would you report this person would you
68:28 - ignore them this is a very difficult
68:30 - decision to make some people watch it
68:37 - like ready to report okay all right I
68:40 - think we can ignore yeah I don't know
68:43 - what the threshold is this one looks
68:47 - pretty upset this one's upsetting I
68:49 - think we should report so is this is
68:53 - actually something that's alive and
68:55 - online that you can look at so right now
68:57 - I haven't made it live because I'm
68:59 - nervous that there's no safeguards in
69:00 - place to keep someone from just coming
69:02 - in and calling every with a Nazi
69:04 - I would like to release a waveguide
69:06 - there's no kind of sign-in system but
69:07 - basically what I'm doing right now is
69:08 - every person that gets reported is put
69:10 - on the Nazi watch list Twitter account
69:12 - so then I can go in and report them or
69:15 - you can come and check it and report
69:17 - those like individuals can come in
69:18 - appropriate Stan okay so I'm trying to
69:25 - now I'm gonna try to determine I'm gonna
69:26 - see more background noise but it's
69:28 - better overall know if I believe
69:31 - everybody
69:50 - I'm testing a difference no mic see if
69:52 - it's better
69:53 - we're saying it's better 218 I don't
69:58 - know if that numbers accurate this is a
70:09 - little bit of a quieter area anyway
70:30 - well his name is Braden state where
70:36 - we'll find a Google and flight simulator
70:38 - the next control controller you can see
70:43 - the face from the screen moving around
70:45 - but uh basically you get to like lean
70:48 - your arm lean and and pretend like your
70:51 - body's a joystick and then flap your
70:52 - arms like a bird to control the plane
70:55 - and Google Earth also can you
70:58 - demonstrate it yeah
71:23 - I am
71:27 - there you go
71:33 - all right right now we're flying around
71:35 - Mount Holly acolo and Hawaii it's uh I
71:39 - was like it's nighttime in Hawaii
71:47 - combining some coding and statistical
71:51 - interaction because intangibles still
71:53 - pretty fun love a good time laughs I
71:56 - think that really brings people together
71:58 - there's one thing you learn from
72:00 - probably coding training then smiles are
72:02 - good definitely awesome great job thank
72:06 - you thank you for sharing
72:18 - grab the microphone so that I have it so
72:26 - I've got the microphone which I'm gonna
72:29 - put it in my mini my back we're gonna go
72:31 - whoops so we get somewhere really loud
72:36 - and I need to switch to it
72:46 - [Music]
73:13 - you want to want to say your name and
73:15 - give me a quick explanation yeah Terrell

77:07 - alright thank you I'm so happy for
77:09 - somebody else to hold this camera okay
77:13 - all right I think that Tong should just
77:19 - operate the camera we have a today okay
77:22 - tell me about this project I'm drinking
77:25 - Park and this project is about the close
77:30 - [Music]
77:48 - because they did 45 Express this moment
77:53 - that's beautiful thank
78:02 - so I could probably do this you know
78:04 - while holding this yeah
78:10 - so I
78:12 - [Music]
78:18 - it's really responsive this Tuesday
78:24 - though okay hi today we tell you about
78:27 - your project I'm Sarah and this is
78:29 - change a bit so we have here a string of
78:34 - bricks that work as a string of bits
78:36 - that encode an instruction for a
78:39 - computer to change something in the
78:40 - screen so each and every brick can be
78:45 - there like lying down or thing like and
78:48 - then people that participate you can are
78:53 - free to change the state of these bricks
78:56 - manipulate the output of the computer
79:03 - something
79:06 - because I'm in this grand so there's
79:11 - some kind of encoding in breaks hey guys
79:15 - I missed the update on the screen so
79:17 - here take that brick the tall one but
79:20 - don't do it yet wait slide up the screen
79:22 - okay and then you can sit down
79:30 - [Music]
79:38 - and also this whole image contains like
79:41 - their like a memory of history of all
79:45 - the previous actions of the participants
80:01 - we have many sir can you tell your
80:05 - neighbor tell me about your project
80:06 - my name is Daniel I predicted skull in
80:09 - Leiden and it's about controlling the
80:11 - illumination of a room with a little
80:13 - candle so in this in this project I've
80:16 - we have a linear Chatham and you can
80:17 - interact with each item and in order to
80:19 - control the dimensions of the room you
80:23 - can you can try if you want going in the
80:26 - room everybody oh it's so bright in here
80:29 - alright I'm gonna turn the camera to
80:31 - point up now
80:42 - okay now I'm going to show you the
80:44 - sensor that I'm touching
80:46 - [Music]
81:25 - [Music]
81:33 - if I'm not actually using the mic I can
81:37 - actually put the phone in the gimbal in
81:40 - a better place because I had to have a
81:42 - slightly to the side with the fairway
81:45 - vehicle second
81:47 - there we go
82:15 - [Music]
82:26 - [Music]
82:31 - [Music]
82:50 - [Music]
83:03 - [Music]
83:19 - privileged easier is oftentimes the
83:22 - difficult conversation so we framed it
83:24 - in the form of a game to do so there's
83:33 - surveys online about privilege and we
83:36 - took from that survey some of the
83:38 - questions and we made some of our
83:40 - questions
83:45 - [Music]
83:50 - so the British lines was represent like
83:53 - life and success
84:23 - [Music]
84:25 - and I guess you guys to explain this
84:26 - project alright so first tell me your
84:31 - name
84:31 - my name is Terry Gutierrez I'm a first
84:33 - year graduate student at ITP and so this
84:37 - project is called the starting line
84:38 - project I'm it's a racing game followed
84:41 - by privilege so we have two players two
84:43 - users
84:44 - answer a sentence of ten questions yes
84:46 - or no and if the answer is yes to any
84:48 - questions they run on the yes mat for
84:51 - two seconds and they step back and if
84:52 - the answer is no to the questions and
84:54 - step one or no mat and step back and so
84:56 - our overall goal was to use technology
84:58 - as a way to make the conversation around
85:00 - privilege a little bit easier oftentimes
85:03 - it's extremely difficult to have so we
85:05 - thought that one of the best ways to do
85:07 - so is embedding that within the game and
85:10 - so you see here our participants had a
85:12 - score 50 and 30 we're kind of using the
85:23 - game as a mere a little bit on your life
85:27 - [Music]
85:44 - and now we're going down to zero we're
86:22 - going down okay
86:23 - counter clockwise you guys into each
86:25 - other one and tell me you names and tell
86:28 - me about this project wait okay yes okay

98:55 - not sponsored yet by freshman Co but
98:57 - someday let's keep going back this way
99:00 - we are now walking through it's probably
99:03 - like that was like a dance studio or a

101:25 - controller out of a cello so essentially
101:28 - the cello the note is picked up the
101:31 - contact microphone and then the
101:34 - frequency is analyzed in max/msp and
101:37 - then translated to a MIDI value and sent
101:40 - to Ableton Live where two software
101:43 - synthesizers are controlled
101:45 - series of knobs here that control
101:49 - different aspects of the sentence
101:52 - well we got some shots of is it or not

105:34 - project the sound okay everybody okay so
105:38 - tell me your name and tell me about that
105:39 - project to do an installation
105:51 - installation in which we have to use the
105:54 - server to refresh our installation at a
105:59 - wet-nap
105:59 - and we discover that every time people
106:02 - we're in front of the webcam and we
106:04 - opened the server we could talk to them
106:06 - and they thought it was a computer
106:08 - talking to them so we adapted that and
106:11 - we created this game that's called
106:12 - century in which people have to lock the
106:15 - word that we give them and they're
106:17 - chatting with a human normally so much
106:23 - fun could people actually hear the audio
106:26 - there I mean I might I might like I have
106:35 - this knife but it was probably more
106:36 - profitable as husband if I might come
106:38 - back nobody could hear that audio is

108:18 - [Applause]
108:25 - [Applause]
108:29 - [Music]
108:42 - we're in the lobby we're gonna take a
108:45 - look at this giant heart oh actually
108:47 - while this is empty
108:58 - oh they're doing very well this is a
109:01 - live stream warning here before you say
109:04 - anything nearly in a minute I'm gonna
109:12 - ask you to explain the project I'm just
109:14 - gonna kind of mess around with it a
109:15 - little bit did you turn it off okay I'm
109:25 - sensing some musician
109:27 - [Music]
109:38 - the elevators here do I come back there
109:47 - you go there's everything just magnets
110:01 - and so what was different when you
110:12 - actually meaning it's magnetic so this
110:16 - is for the like music sound insulation
110:19 - and also it's kind of like capricious
110:22 - and moved by like Megadeth dislike is
110:32 - heading itself and then like the other
110:34 - maga is like something around and I can
110:36 - combine like like you know like boom
110:39 - boom a gonna make a different lady big
110:41 - bouncers in the recipe to the
110:48 - performance like not was like actually
110:54 - same setup with them like promise well
110:57 - like Emily likes people like play with
110:59 - the Magadan and places like make
111:02 - more like dressing the cake that you can
111:04 - combine the other and I can mmm
111:07 - yeah so I knew you like try you want to
111:12 - mess around with it a little bit
111:21 - [Music]
111:30 - what color the ping-pong balls meant the
111:36 - like really make a like
111:43 - [Music]
111:48 - [Music]
111:56 - this is a video of you performing in
111:58 - right from night oh no that's a
112:02 - different project okay
112:11 - [Music]
112:21 - [Music]
112:28 - [Music]
112:44 - awesome great job Haley thank you
112:47 - alright I should let every know it I
112:50 - just got my 10% 10% battery warning so
112:55 - this stream is going to be wrapping up I
112:56 - am going to go outside into the freezing
112:58 - cold because why not is let's let's go
113:03 - outside into the streets of New York
113:04 - City and let's take a look at whoo okay
113:07 - this whole people won't run into me
113:09 - let's take a look at this project here
113:14 - this is a giant heart
113:24 - we
113:26 - walk down the street here I'm hopeful
113:29 - you're gonna lose Wi-Fi
114:00 - okay going back inside
114:07 - and I'm going to good evening
114:19 - here we go get my here and ring back in
114:37 - [Music]
114:43 - buddy
114:48 - [Music]
114:55 - [Music]
115:04 - yeah they also make it know is that it's
115:08 - here
115:10 - [Music]
115:16 - one left left
115:24 - [Music]
115:33 - before I didn't design liberal but now
115:35 - the high score is like 4,000
115:40 - [Music]
115:41 - can you explain the project yes some of
115:44 - your name my name is hung and this is my
115:46 - final project this it's name is into the
115:49 - darkness and it's a space exploring game
115:52 - I'll show you how now you see a little
115:56 - rocket on the screen and you can choose
116:06 - and your goal is to achieve the highest
116:08 - distance as possible
116:18 - and the reason why I want to make a
116:20 - controller like this is because nowadays
116:23 - people play games on keyboards and
116:25 - joysticks and Xbox controllers I wanted
116:27 - to make their control methods like more
116:29 - intuitive not because just what you do
116:33 - is what you saw on the screen because I
116:36 - lived with this rocket and the rocket
116:39 - goes up so it's like more intuitive
116:58 - [Music]
117:12 - [Music]
117:26 - and he likes you
117:28 - what
117:39 - [Music]
117:51 - yeah it's fun watching
117:56 - we get sick sometimes it doesn't
118:06 - yeah your name and tell me if he wants
118:09 - about your project course I'm sure yeah
118:11 - I'm a first year and this is artificial
118:13 - unintelligent it about robots trying to
118:16 - be like human failing miserably like
118:18 - they're in fact making because they're
118:20 - not human but they want to be human so
118:22 - badly they're all from different parts
118:24 - of the world and they're all gonna talk
118:25 - to you what you want
118:27 - this one is Jacques is Shawn Harry he's
118:30 - an artist when you listen to him and you
118:36 - understand he's a struggling artist look
118:39 - at him is no idea where to go what to do
118:41 - yes but he will try for you I'm so sorry
118:46 - we are she she she's from Brisbane she
118:52 - always want to be a pediatric nurse
118:54 - because she's a robot then she gotta
118:56 - have a scale that you gotta get like go
118:59 - of it and she trying to figure out okay
119:02 - baby to sleep but it's sort of
119:04 - impossible she was in and out it
119:14 - this is Danny Danny likes a nun he's a
119:18 - little old to be constantly shaking and
119:20 - he's wrapping himself in things you have
119:22 - no idea about but we will not for you
119:25 - and I will figure out where this case I
119:30 - can feel it
119:33 - so much personality would thanks guys
119:53 - this is live right now you just want to
119:56 - say hi hi again
120:50 - [Music]
120:51 - let's try this I'm going back to my
120:53 - office let's try a few more okay tell me
120:56 - your name tell me about this project
121:02 - phone game use machine learning library
121:05 - to Train how you interact move the
121:07 - puzzle so you want to try it yeah
121:14 - [Music]
121:16 - so now is training according to videos
121:19 - that I give it as an input so here you
121:23 - can see so this is going to be this is
121:30 - gonna be done for the day
121:33 - up for their rights
121:40 - you're playing against yourself
121:44 - I can play with someone especially
121:53 - whenever a three-night mine is gonna be
122:05 - [Music]
122:09 - great job thank you
122:12 - okay did you tell me your name and the 1
122:15 - second 1 or 2 second version your
122:16 - project sure my name is Dan I'll bet at
122:18 - my project reaction where you're looking
122:21 - so if you're looking left it'll move to
122:23 - the left until I came right over to the
122:24 - right and it just uses your eyes
122:38 - [Music]
122:43 - well I need some footage of what I was
122:45 - actually doing
122:53 - okay thank you
123:02 - [Music]
123:46 - five
123:58 - [Music]
124:20 - [Music]
124:26 - she's gonna get you to explain this
124:28 - project to me okay first day your name
124:31 - and tell me how your but I'm funny but
124:33 - the question and I made it police
124:36 - to reflect on a normal piece which is
124:38 - 1984 there's a certain part in it which
124:41 - is the too many page which is about the
124:44 - 40 members are rebelling against the
124:46 - party's enemies for the 32 minutes so it
124:49 - might be for Luther is wearing a
124:52 - brain-based answer and the concentration
124:55 - they can destroy a mystical entity which
124:57 - is over there these are now sugar cube
124:59 - and sugar cube like your sugar and oil
125:03 - has like a certain effect to each other
125:04 - so because I used motor oil this time
125:07 - sugar after a few hours will start to
125:11 - melt very slowly on a canvas so the
125:14 - outcome is a painting
125:23 - [Music]
125:31 - [Music]
126:02 - [Music]
126:08 - jerk back here okay okay everyone all
126:19 - right I think that's gonna be it for
126:21 - today hold on I gotta turn this gimbal
126:24 - thing off this is what you can be a
126:28 - patron anybody wants to sign up for
126:32 - patreon I'll just show you guys a little
126:34 - behind the scenes here this is all the
126:39 - stickers getting ready to be mailed out
126:41 - a whole bunch of books being it getting
126:43 - ready to be mailed out some more books
126:45 - and boxes some preparation for some
126:49 - future machine learning videos and so
126:53 - yeah so that was boy an over two hours
126:56 - but the TP show I can manage uh Simon
127:01 - one of my loyal viewers Simon did
127:04 - request that I come back to my office
127:05 - and answer a few questions which I can't
127:08 - attempt to do so let me see what time is
127:10 - 5:15
127:12 - so the bag the phone battery is gonna be
127:14 - dead pretty soon so one thing that all
127:17 - it hopefully happened is so you go this
127:20 - this vid this archive be left up forever
127:23 - if you can watch the whole
127:24 - two-and-a-half hour thing I will try I
127:29 - to link in the video's description to
127:31 - all the projects and information about
127:33 - the projects it's pretty hard to do that
127:34 - but if you read in the comments a
127:36 - project that you're interested in and
127:37 - it's not there in the description please
127:38 - let me know I can try to find it or put
127:41 - you in touch with the students do you
127:42 - wanna hire somebody you saw do a project
127:44 - to do something all these are current
127:46 - students so I'm sure looking for
127:47 - exciting and interesting things to do I
127:49 - will be here on Thursday for the last
127:53 - livestream of the year with some actual
127:55 - coding tutorials I do I hope you just do
127:58 - coding just goofy fun whatever coding
128:02 - challenges for a few hours I'm gonna
128:04 - make that a processing fundraiser if you
128:06 - haven't made your processing foundation
128:07 - donation yet safe hold off donate live
128:10 - on Thursday and I will read your name
128:12 - live on the air and then when I get back
128:16 - in January which I don't know when will
128:19 - be exactly
128:20 - but sometime after the new year probably
128:21 - not the second or the third will be a
128:23 - few days in later that week I will start
128:27 - on the machine learning stuff so that's
128:28 - my project for the spring is to get back
128:30 - into that so if you have ideas for
128:33 - things that I should do on Thursday
128:35 - especially if you're in the patron group
128:38 - let me know and I see the design but I
128:42 - just saw slack message come through
128:43 - about k-means so I might not do that on
128:46 - Thursday because that I might save that
128:49 - for the machine learning stuff I'm gonna
128:50 - do in January but I will certainly be
128:52 - getting to that particular problem any
128:55 - last questions anyone wants to ask I see
129:02 - that number of people mishima is it the
129:05 - same as AI well not exactly I'm sitting
129:09 - in my office here at New York University
129:11 - Tisch School of the Arts fourth floor
129:13 - ITP artificial intelligence is a very
129:17 - broad term and so it's machine learning
129:20 - and they there's a lot of Oh 10% battery
129:21 - remaining there's certainly a lot of
129:23 - crossover there but I really think about
129:25 - machine learning as the boy it's really
129:28 - hard to talk up you're doing this for
129:29 - two and a half hours the act of making
129:31 - sense out of data really and you're
129:35 - asking about my watch this is just a
129:37 - Fitbit blaze I kind of want to get one
129:38 - of those new ones though and what am I
129:44 - trying to say if artificial intelligence
129:45 - being an even a broader term just about
129:48 - computers appearing and simulating and
129:51 - being made a whole video about these
129:53 - different terms like do it now my mind
129:55 - is totally much for doing this live
129:57 - stream for two and a half hours where in
130:01 - the building is your place where I
130:02 - create the videos ah that's on the ninth
130:03 - floor in this building so I did not go
130:06 - up there but I will do I know young from
130:10 - OSU I do via the internet I don't know I
130:13 - always met in person but I'd you know we
130:16 - were talking about
130:21 - ya know I do get notifications on this
130:24 - computer though you're no hearing my
130:25 - notifications for every message until ah
130:27 - yeah I guess I could turn that off
130:29 - because that I need notifications for
130:32 - live well what's your favorite product
130:35 - possibly pick a favorite project I love
130:37 - so many of them thank you to some of the
130:40 - patrons I noticed alcaman particular
130:42 - moderating some of the chat cuz it get a
130:43 - little crazy here in this YouTube place
130:48 - and as soon as I end this the video I
130:54 - think will end up I'm gonna be doing
130:56 - word to back in JavaScript I teach at a
130:59 - program called ITP you can find out more
131:01 - about a called there's both an undergrad
131:03 - for a graduate program the graduate
131:04 - program is a two-year master's hey and
131:05 - sean vann every director of graduate
131:08 - studies at the IMA program is just there
131:11 - in the chat so you could ask him your
131:12 - questions trying to beat this is I'm
131:14 - onna this is a one-minute 132 of this I
131:18 - I don't think I've made it to every
131:19 - project at the show but I'm completely
131:22 - exhausted now my battery is probably
131:23 - about five percent left what do I teach
131:25 - I mostly teach coding classes and you
131:29 - know I cost us that or about using
131:32 - computational media F for your own
131:34 - passions and interests I do not give the
131:37 - coding challenges to the students but
131:38 - they use them for their projects and
131:39 - examples as you might've seen one of
131:41 - them earlier use the starfield
131:42 - one but you just create their own work
131:45 - here so I don't give specific homework
131:46 - assignments that is live Eston thank you
131:51 - so much that the level of hearing
131:52 - messages like this thank you oh I don't
131:55 - know very much about view but I think I
131:56 - love you and Sarah Dresner who is a
132:00 - wonderful amazing programmer and teacher
132:02 - and creator does a lot of educational
132:03 - material and stuff around view her
132:06 - twitter name is going like sarah
132:07 - underscore you know you should look her
132:09 - up she's amazing after Susie yes okay
132:14 - the assessment we're past fail here and
132:16 - we talk about projects the undergraduate
132:19 - program will probably be different than
132:20 - that but the graduate program is
132:22 - pass/fail and the assessment is done
132:23 - through discussion and feedback
132:27 - okay um so thank you everyone I think
132:30 - III have a lot of videos already about
132:32 - nodejs copyright free music asking in
132:35 - the chat what kind of fancy effects do I
132:37 - have here I just have to try this okay
132:41 - to use these effects before I go
132:44 - Oh glamour no I think the dance party is
132:47 - the best one who bubbles okay
132:54 - all right uh-huh
132:55 - so I don't know how to turn these off so
132:59 - anyway thank you guys for tuning in to
133:00 - this um this was a lot of fun to do and
