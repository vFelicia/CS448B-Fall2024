00:01 - okay I'm back for more matter.js it
00:04 - matter.js to me to make never mind it it
00:08 - was going to work but it didn't okay so
00:09 - what I want to do this is what I left
00:11 - off in the last video and the thing that
00:12 - I want to add to this is a mouse
00:14 - constraint but you know what there's
00:16 - something that I really should add first
00:18 - which is that even though um there's all
00:21 - of these uh part all these I'm going to
00:24 - call them particles circles and they
00:27 - leave and then I add some more I've
00:28 - never actually told
00:30 - my code or the matter.js engine that
00:33 - those circles have left the screen we
00:35 - can now ignore them so it's going to
00:37 - start to run very very slow after a
00:39 - while so first of all let me just change
00:40 - something here to demonstrate this which
00:42 - is to say instead of adding circles when
00:45 - I uh drag the mouse I'm just going to
00:47 - every time through draw I'm going to add
00:50 - a circle uh at the
00:53 - top um and just so there's going to be a
00:55 - new Circle every frame so now it's doing
00:57 - this automatically and you know I kind
00:58 - of want to move that top one a little
01:00 - further down there's not really a good
01:02 - reason to do this but uh let's do that
01:06 - yeah so this is a little better to sort
01:07 - of demonstrate just so see so now I move
01:09 - that a little bit down so we can see
01:11 - after a while I'm sure this is going to
01:13 - start running very very very slow so two
01:15 - things I need to do number one is I need
01:17 - to remove those objects from my array
01:19 - when they're off the screen but number
01:21 - two I probably also need to tell the
01:23 - physics engine stop trying to calculate
01:26 - geometry with them so I know how to
01:27 - remove them from my array so let's do
01:29 - that first so here in this this is where
01:33 - I'm kind of looping through and drawing
01:34 - all of them so I can write add some code
01:36 - something like if circles. is off
01:42 - screen then
01:44 - uh then circles. splice I comma 1 so
01:49 - what what is what is this doing so this
01:51 - is the idea here if and not if circles
01:53 - index I if this particular circle is off
01:56 - the screen then I'm done with it and
02:00 - splice is a function that removes an
02:02 - object from an array so I want to remove
02:04 - the I object from the array and I only
02:06 - want to remove one object so splice
02:07 - allows you to remove like I and then the
02:10 - two after it if I wanted to but I don't
02:11 - want to do that here so is offc screen
02:13 - this will just work right no it has no
02:16 - idea what is off screen is that's not
02:18 - some sort of function that exists um but
02:20 - it's something that I can write so I go
02:21 - into box. JS which really should be
02:23 - called circle. JS um I can write a
02:26 - function called is off
02:28 - screen
02:31 - and what do I want to do well first I
02:33 - want the position of the particle so I
02:37 - can say VAR PA equals this. body.
02:40 - position and now I can say you know
02:42 - there's a lot of things I could evaluate
02:43 - here but I'm just going to do something
02:44 - really easy if p.y is greater than
02:47 - height plus like 100 like it's not only
02:49 - at the bottom it's like 100 pixels below
02:51 - the bottom then a return true and yes
02:55 - yes yes yes actually so let's do this
02:57 - here everybody always complains I like
02:58 - to write silly code like
03:01 - this just to really kind of illustrate
03:04 - exactly what's going on if this is true
03:07 - return true otherwise return false but
03:09 - notice the way I just said that if this
03:10 - is true return true that's kind of silly
03:13 - this whole thing evaluates to true or
03:15 - false so something I can actually do to
03:16 - make my code a bit more concise is just
03:19 - return what this evaluates to so return
03:22 - true or false is pause y greater than he
03:25 - so so now we should this should kind of
03:28 - work and it's actually I I'm expecting
03:30 - it to work so let's just look here at um
03:34 - uh What's this called circles. length
03:38 - 144 145 so that's it's got to be working
03:41 - right if it's 145 now oh whoa but look
03:44 - what's going on see all this like crazy
03:47 - flickering what's that flickering so
03:49 - this is
03:51 - why you need that what I've done there's
03:53 - a flaw in what I've done a major flaw
03:57 - and I do have a video where I go through
03:58 - this but I'm going to mention it right
03:59 - now because you don't want to go find
04:01 - that other video so what's the issue
04:03 - here I'm going to I'm going to do a
04:04 - quick
04:05 - explanation let's say I have an array
04:08 - and it has circles in
04:10 - it a b c d and e and C is actually the
04:15 - one that's off the
04:17 - screen C is the one that's off the
04:19 - screen a b d Etc e are all on the screen
04:23 - so I check zero oh it's on the screen I
04:26 - check one oh it's on the screen I check
04:28 - two oh oh it's not on the screen anymore
04:32 - delete it so I remove it from the array
04:34 - you know what happens when you remove
04:35 - something splice something from the
04:36 - array this is what happens to the array
04:39 - that those two elements move down one
04:42 - that's gone so now check three it's fine
04:45 - what happened I checked a b c and then I
04:48 - checked E I never actually checked D
04:50 - because when I was checking index 2 I
04:52 - removed it and then D slid into index 2
04:55 - so I just went un checked E so this is
04:57 - what's happening I'm kind of like
04:58 - skipping them and then I'm also like not
05:01 - rendering one CU it like moved and it
05:02 - didn't get rendered which is why it's
05:03 - flickering so what I actually need to
05:05 - there's a bunch of ways I could resolve
05:06 - this I'm sure there's like a very fancy
05:08 - JavaScript using some kind of
05:09 - sophisticated array function that you
05:12 - all will let me know in the comments but
05:13 - a quick way I could do is just go
05:14 - through the array backwards I could also
05:16 - do something like just say I minus minus
05:19 - like let me just back up one let's add
05:21 - that into the
05:22 - code and now we should see we don't see
05:25 - that flickering problem anymore because
05:27 - I'm not skipping any so but I could also
05:28 - Loop through the array back backwards um
05:30 - and now I can just check to make sure
05:32 - this is working you know it's
05:35 - growing but then it went down so
05:37 - definitely things are being removed now
05:39 - the thing is though I only removed them
05:44 - from uh I only removed them from the the
05:48 - array I think matter JS is still
05:51 - thinking about them it's still the world
05:53 - matter is like this world is full of
05:55 - circles and I'm going to figure out if
05:57 - they're bouncing even though if they're
05:58 - like thousands of pixels below the
06:00 - screen so I don't actually know how to
06:01 - do this let's look at the matter D chess
06:04 - documentation ah
06:07 - remove generic remove function removes
06:09 - one or many bodies constraints or
06:11 - composits to the given composite
06:13 - optionally searching its children
06:14 - recursively oh so there's all this kind
06:16 - of like ways that the bodies can have
06:18 - relationships that things can be like
06:20 - sort of tethered together if I remove
06:21 - one should I remove all the other ones
06:23 - but we're not in that sophisticated of a
06:25 - space right now so I'm just going to say
06:28 - I think what's going to work is if I go
06:32 - to uh
06:33 - box if it's off screen what I might want
06:37 - to do is also do something like circles
06:42 - because I might want to do this in other
06:43 - place like uh
06:46 - remove from World okay you guys can
06:49 - think of a better function name for that
06:51 - uh remove from world
06:54 - uh so this do remove from World equals
07:00 - function and I'm just going to say
07:02 - world. remove World this. body so I'm
07:06 - pretty sure that that and there's a way
07:09 - that we can test this actually so let's
07:13 - um let's run this so there's how many
07:17 - and I probably shouldn't have let's hold
07:19 - on let's let's first comment this out so
07:23 - right now I'm not calling my own remove
07:25 - from world so I am going and what are
07:28 - I'm going to get rid of these console
07:29 - laws logging things that are uh
07:32 - polluting my
07:35 - um um probably in the boundary yeah
07:38 - sorry uh okay so there's my array which
07:42 - is called
07:45 - circles
07:47 - 136 now there's also an
07:49 - array in matter which I believe is
07:55 - probably bodies
07:58 - Dot
08:00 - or no
08:02 - world. bodies I think the world itself
08:05 - keeps track of everything that's in it
08:06 - that's an array.
08:09 - length 913 quick circles. length 147 so
08:14 - you can see matter dos thinks there's
08:16 - 913 things whereas I think there's only
08:20 - 147 so now what I should be able to do
08:22 - and let's be more precise about this
08:24 - actually let's just indw let's console
08:26 - log these console
08:28 - log
08:30 - uh circles. length and then what did I
08:34 - say a world. bodies. length so let's
08:39 - look at both of these so we can see that
08:42 - they're kind of working together until
08:44 - they start to leave the screen my I'm
08:47 - deleting stuff but this just keeps going
08:49 - up and up and up and up and up so now
08:52 - what do I do if I put back in my
08:54 - function where I am additionally not
08:57 - only removing it from my array but
08:59 - telling matter digest to remove the body
09:02 - itself I think we're going to see this
09:05 - now be
09:07 - correct and there we go
09:14 - right wait hold on it's not exactly in
09:18 - sync I mean it's a little bit off why is
09:20 - it off oh look at this oh boy oh boy
09:24 - something weird has happened look at
09:26 - this weird bug certain ones have stopped
09:28 - and been removed I have a feeling this
09:29 - has to do with the way that I'm going
09:31 - through the array oh I know what's the
09:33 - problem
09:34 - is look at this boy I've been really
09:38 - careless H splice it and then
09:41 - remove I removed it from the array and
09:44 - then the stuff slid down and I told to
09:46 - remove the one after it which wasn't
09:47 - actually removed from the array so that
09:49 - was a really bad bug this has got to be
09:51 - first there might be a a different way I
09:54 - could think about organizing this to
09:55 - protect myself from that kind of error
09:57 - but this at least now we should see
10:00 - whoops we should see this fixed I'm in
10:03 - Mouse which I haven't even done yet okay
10:05 - so let's look Let me refresh here so
10:07 - let's see here now here we go once they
10:09 - start getting removed we should see that
10:11 - they're staying in sync uh there we go
10:14 - now one thing you'll notice if I just
10:15 - say no Loop here just to
10:17 - pause the sketch for a second you'll
10:20 - notice that the thing the number of
10:22 - things that matter dos thinks exist is
10:25 - always two more than what I think that's
10:27 - because there's two boundaries so this
10:29 - there's this is I think an interesting
10:31 - question which is I've introduced a
10:32 - great deal of redundancy and I'm keeping
10:34 - track of my like own arrays of stuff but
10:36 - matters actually keeps track of
10:38 - everything itself but I'm doing that
10:40 - just so I can have total control over
10:42 - the sort of visual design and and
10:44 - management of the entities and not have
10:47 - to rely on because I want to keep these
10:49 - things in separate arrays whereas
10:51 - matter.js the bodies array keeps
10:52 - everything in one array but you know
10:54 - there's reasons why you might not do it
10:56 - one way or the other but okay so I said
10:57 - this was going to be that I was going to
10:58 - introduce the Mouse but there was enough
11:00 - here just in looking at removing bodies
11:02 - from the world that that was a pretty
11:04 - good topic for this video and the next
11:06 - video the next thing I'm going to add is
11:08 - a mouse constraint where I can click on
11:10 - these things and drag them around so
11:11 - I'll see you in that
