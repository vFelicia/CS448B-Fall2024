00:02 - So...
00:04 - If you've been watching these videos about arrays... whether or not I mentioned it, I probably did, but I don't specifically recall.
00:09 - You would have noticed this. An array is a fixed size. When we declare an array. When we make an array.
00:16 - When we say I'm going to have an array of
00:20 - Bubbles, right. When I say I'm going to have an array of bubbles. I have to say it is a new
00:26 - array of Bubbles and I have to specify the number of bubbles
00:31 - I want to have. I have to say are there going to be ten bubbles, 100 bubbles, a thousand bubbles.
00:36 - That number... that is the size of the array. The size of that array can never change. If later in the program
00:42 - I suddenly want 200 bubbles. I can't just add an extra hundred bubbles there.
00:46 - I could delete the array and make a new array and do all sorts of crazy stuff, but an array is a fixed size.
00:52 - So we... this is obviously a severe limitation. I mean there are plenty of reasons
00:57 - why a fixed size is perfectly good for you.
00:59 - If you are making some sort of a game, and it has 10 players.
01:04 - Then you just need an array of 10 players. 10 scores.
01:08 - 10 player names. Right. You know, there's not suddenly ever going to be 12 players or 9 players. It's always a 10 player game.
01:14 - There's many instances where an array of fixed size is totally what you need and that's great.
01:18 - But there are also lots of scenarios where you want to start with no bubbles on the screen.
01:23 - And then a moment happens and a few bubbles come out and then another moment happens, and now there's six bubbles,
01:28 - and there's 12, and then there's 15, and then suddenly all the bubbles go away, and there's no bubbles anymore.
01:32 - I don't know why I'm talking about this strange world of bubbles
01:34 - but you can imagine lots of different scenarios where you want to have this flexible number of elements on the screen.
01:40 - We need to develop strategies for doing this and there are many.
01:46 - So um there's there's a couple that I'm going to just sort of briefly gloss over and point you
01:52 - towards other
01:54 - information about. For one if you look through the processing reference under array, you'll see that there are a whole set of functions.
02:01 - There's one called append.
02:06 - I don't remember what the other ones are called. It's funny cuz this is what happend to me the last time I did this video.
02:11 - shortened. slice.
02:13 - There's a lot of functions and what these functions allow you to do is
02:17 - manipulate the size of the array and you might choose someday to use those functions. I encourage you to go look up.
02:23 - Sorry have a cough I encourage you go to look up those functions in the reference to see how they work. See if they apply
02:28 - to you, but let me just make something very very clear.
02:31 - Let's say we're going to use the function append and we have an array of three elements.
02:37 - What's actually
02:38 - happening in the magical computerland is not suddenly that we're appending another element to the end of this array
02:45 - and it becomes bigger.
02:46 - That's what's going that sort of like the result that we want but what Processing really has to do in order to
02:52 - make this larger array...
02:53 - Is it has to make a new array that has four spots in it. It has to take the first three
02:59 - copy them over and then now we have a new spot to add an additional bubble.
03:03 - So while this works and the append function is something you could use,
03:07 - it's not exactly the most efficient and also the syntax for append is slightly awkward and a little bit weird.
03:13 - So I don't love use...
03:14 - I love that these functions exist, and I'm very happy about them, but I don't love using them
03:18 - and I personally don't use them that often. The the solution that I generally use the most often is something called an array list.
03:27 - You can also find the array list in the Processing reference. You can find an example
03:33 - under Topics, Advanced Data. I will link to that below.
03:37 - About how that uses an arraylist for a flexible size... a flexibly a
03:42 - list of things that has flexible size. You can start with nothing add a bunch, delete a bunch. An array is great.
03:47 - It's an object. It has functions.
03:48 - You say... you can say remove, add
03:51 - get, add a whole bunch of things. Use all sort of stuff you can do with an arraylist.
03:55 - I think I just said array earlier when I meant arraylist.
03:57 - I meant arraylist. So an arraylist is something I encourage you to look into and there will be a
04:02 - video that covers the an arraylist more specifically after this one at some points or a link to a video anyway.....
04:09 - Whatever yep, don't worry. I got you covered. Eventually I'll
04:12 - do something about an arraylist.
04:13 - But what I want to do is actually show you a solution that I think is useful in some scenarios, but also
04:20 - just it helps you think about how... how you can manage....
04:24 - it just helps you practice and kind of use arrays more in an interesting way.
04:28 - I was doing so well, but this is you know whatever. I'm doing the best I can.
04:33 - You know.
04:34 - This is my second attempt, and we're just gonna keep going through it, okay.
04:37 - So what let's.... let's give ourselves a scenario to work with. Here's a scenario... We have this..... we have this example...
04:45 - Which we notice we have 100 bubbles.
04:47 - We make a hundred bubbles. They have some random size.
04:49 - And then we call these functions and all these bubbles are floating up on the screen.
04:52 - So let's... let's, let's build in this scenario for ourselves a little exercise for ourselves.
04:58 - What if when this program starts what we want is for there to be no bubbles on the screen...
05:03 - and every time I click the mouse...
05:05 - a new bubble appears. How would we do that?
05:08 - Well one thing that you can always do with an array. Is that you could always say...
05:13 - You know what I'm gonna make an array of a million bubbles. Is that a million? A million a million bubbles
05:18 - and then that way sometimes if I want to use 10
05:21 - or if I want to use 200 for one is 300 I can just use part of the array.
05:24 - So let's leave ourselves at 100 and let's think about what we would do. First of all let me show you something.
05:31 - Look at this loop down here. int i equals 0. i is less than bubbles dot length.
05:36 - What does this loop do?
05:37 - i is 0 than 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5. It's all the way up to 99. Its counting through every element of
05:43 - the array. What if I just said...
05:45 - 10 here.
05:47 - Even though there's a hundred bubbles in that array,
05:50 - I'm only looping through the first 10. Right? If I say zero, how many do I have on the screen?
05:55 - I'm not looping through any of them. If I say 50...
05:59 - What's happening? I only have 50 of them. Now of course if I said
06:02 - 150. We've got a new problem on our hands...
06:06 - Array index out of bounds exception.
06:08 - Array index out of bounds exception. I think... oooh and I think you probably... I probably mentioned this before...
06:14 - But this is the error you get if you try to access an element that doesn't exist. When your array has 10 spots and you
06:20 - go for number 15... That index is out of bounds.
06:23 - So watch out for that error.
06:26 - So we do have a limit here when there's only a hundred
06:28 - but we notice we can change how many were actually actively using at any given point. So...
06:34 - What am I doing here? I keep changing this number manually and running it again.
06:37 - What is what should that indicate to you? That might indicate to you
06:40 - we could use a variable. So what if I had a variable that I called total and I set that variable to zero...
06:47 - and then
06:49 - I put total down here. Well now when I run it... Zero elements.
06:54 - When I run it with ten. Ten bubbles... well, this is a variable now.
06:59 - What could I do? I could say void mousepressed()...
07:05 - total equals total plus one.
07:09 - Look at this no bubbles.
07:11 - Let's hope this works. Click the mouse, one bubble. Click the mouse two bubbles. Click the mouse three bubbles. Click the mouse four bubbles. Click,
07:17 - click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click and I'm adding bubbles.
07:20 - So even though we've made an array of hundred bubbles if we
07:23 - impose some logic where we only use a certain amount of the array, then more of the array
07:28 - and then what could? I do I could add...
07:32 - key pressed....
07:37 - The camera just went off, but you know what I'm doing. I'm gonna turn it back on.
07:43 - If I add a key pressed this one's not going very well. total equals total minus one, and I run this again.
07:50 - What can I do?
07:52 - I could say hey let me add a bunch of bubbles.
07:54 - Let me delete those bubbles. So we can see here that we can manipulate
07:59 - how much of that array that we're using and this is not such a bad strategy
08:04 - And you know even though in arraylist is probably ultimately going to give us more flexibility more power
08:09 - and just it's for more ease in manipulating the size of an array. This is a nice sort of
08:15 - scenario to practice with and kind of get a sense of as an option in... in how you use an array.
08:21 - Now... so, let me give you some thoughts if you want to take this a step further into an exercise.
08:25 - Here's what I would say to you number one is what do you do when total gets to 100? Right, total equals total plus one?
08:31 - There's still only 100 bubbles in that array. What do you do? Do you set total back to zero?
08:36 - How can you keep reusing it? Think about what what scenario you would do there?
08:40 - The other thing you might think about is how could this happen autonomously? So how could you just say every frame. There's like a
08:48 - 1% chance that a new bubble would appear could you pick a random number?
08:51 - And test where that random number is and like what if I picked a random between 0 and 100 and if that random number is
08:56 - Less than 20 does that mean there's a 20% chance?
08:58 - I think I just gave the answer. But implement that. So you don't have to click the mouse to add bubbles.
09:02 - What if it just happens every so often randomly so those are some two things you could try doing.
09:06 - But mostly what I would say to you is
09:08 - find your thing that you've been working on that has an array and just sort of play with the idea of only using part of
09:13 - the array. Could you sort of turn objects in the array on and off? You know that's another thing we could do.
09:18 - What if in the bubble object... here's something you could try. What if in the bubble object, you put... we put a boolean variable...
09:25 - and I said active and it was false...
09:27 - and then I have some if statements in there where I only do the stuff to the bubble if it's
09:31 - active and what if when I click I sort of activate different bubbles. That could be a way that I could also
09:36 - manage certain things to be there or not there at any given moment. So those are some things you could try some ideas.
09:42 - Maybe I'll try to implement that and put it somewhere if it's not there
09:46 - and you're come to this video email me and remind me but
09:49 - but what I would say is um the next thing you should be looking at though is at some point is using an arraylist and
09:56 - I will
09:58 - in the next video or oh I think I have a video already from then let me just say it. I
10:02 - have a video from the Nature of Code series that I'm pretty sure
10:05 - goes through an arraylist and what I'm going to do is link to that from from this video.
10:09 - So you can go move on to that if you're interested in arraylist, and if that doesn't exist, then I'll make one. Okay
10:14 - I've babbled for too long.
10:15 - I hope this one was ok and I will see you
10:17 - later. The next set of videos will just be I think the next set of is gonna make about images and pixels. Image processing.
10:23 - Loading images from the camera all sorts of cool fun stuff that hopefully you will enjoy. Ok good. Bye.
