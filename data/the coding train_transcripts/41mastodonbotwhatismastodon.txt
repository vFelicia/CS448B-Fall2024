00:00 - (bell dinging)
- Hello this is a first video
00:03 - in a new series about
making a Mastodon bot.
00:07 - And you might be asking yourself,
00:09 - okay, why are you
making, what is Mastodon,
00:12 - why are you making a Mastodon bot
00:14 - and why should I care?
00:16 - (laughing) I'm not really
sure why you should care
00:18 - but I'm going to try to
answer those other questions
00:20 - and you yourself can decide.
00:21 - So this playlist is
essentially a replacement
00:26 - for Session 4:Twitter API
and Bots with Node.js.
00:30 - So I'm going to not redo 15.1 and 15.2
00:34 - if you have never used Node before
00:36 - or don't know what NPM is, you can go back
00:38 - and watch those two videos,
00:40 - but I'm going to start here
basically with setting up,
00:42 - setting up a Twitter,
setting up a Mastodon.
00:45 - And so what is Mastodon, why are we here?
00:47 - So the Twitter API, which I used to create
00:50 - these set of tutorials,
recently changed quite a bit.
00:54 - So it is much harder to
signup for a new account
00:58 - authorized for automation, making a bot
01:00 - that posts in an automatic way to Twitter.
01:03 - They also changed something about the API
01:05 - called the streaming API,
the way that you could
01:07 - connect to Twitter and
listen for certain events.
01:10 - They changed the API and
that is no longer available.
01:12 - So while I encourage
you to still experiment
01:15 - with Twitter as a platform if you so like.
01:18 - If today is your first day wanting to like
01:21 - learn some stuff about
node and social networking
01:23 - and making up social networks
and making a bot that posts,
01:26 - Mastodon is going to
be a more pleasurable,
01:28 - easy-going experience for
you that's going to allow you
01:31 - to express your creativity
in a much more immediate way.
01:33 - And then there's another reason.
01:34 - It has to do with this idea
called decentralization.
01:37 - So Twitter, I don't
know if you've noticed,
01:39 - it's kind of an awful place
to be for the most part,
01:42 - I don't want to get too
far down that discussion,
01:44 - but is there, is there another way?
01:47 - Is there another way
that we can communicate
01:49 - with each other in a
less centralized governed
01:53 - and owned by large
corporations kind of way.
01:55 - And one way to do that
01:57 - is with a concept called decentralization.
01:59 - And Mastodon is an
open-source, I don't know
02:02 - maybe I should go somewhere
where it actually says
02:04 - what it is, well you can read it,
02:06 - Follow friends and discover new ones.
02:08 - Publish anything you want
link, pictures, text, video.
02:10 - All on a platform that is
community-owned and ad free.
02:12 - You know this is not like
some sort of sponsored video
02:14 - I'm experimenting with this platform
02:16 - because it interests me and
maybe it'll interest you.
02:20 - It is open-source project.
02:22 - You can see it's on GitHub here
02:24 - and the decentralization runs
02:26 - with a protocol called ActivityPub.
02:28 - So let me try to give you an understanding
02:30 - of what I mean by all this stuff.
02:32 - What is Twitter, I don't know if anyone
02:34 - should really answer that
question but (laughing)
02:38 - I will give you a little framework.
02:40 - So Twitter is a company, they
run probably a lot of servers.
02:46 - You can be sitting on your
laptop or your, you know,
02:52 - phone, that's a phone apparently,
02:54 - and you could sign up for
an account on Twitter.
02:57 - You could give yourself
a Twitter user name
02:59 - like @shiffman and then
you could post messages
03:02 - like the heart emoji and
you can read other messages
03:06 - that other people are
sending into Twitter.
03:10 - This is what you would refer
to as a centralized platform.
03:16 - The software that runs Twitter
03:18 - is on a particular
server, it's proprietary.
03:21 - The way Twitter is governed in how, where,
03:23 - what certain posts are
allowed and aren't allowed
03:26 - are all run by this same company.
03:29 - And all of your data, all of the tweets
03:32 - you've ever posted, all
of your user information,
03:34 - your password stuff, all of that is stored
03:36 - on this centralized server.
03:38 - The web didn't start with this idea
03:40 - of a centralized platform, the idea was
03:43 - many different nodes all interconnected,
03:45 - being able to share and
publish with each other.
03:47 - And so there is, slowly
entering the Zite guys now,
03:50 - this idea of decentralized platforms.
03:52 - Probably if you're not familiar with that
03:54 - you're probably familiar with something
03:55 - called Bitcoin, right,
which runs on something
03:58 - called blockchain which is a protocol
03:59 - for decentralized financial transactions
04:01 - which I am not going to
make any videos about
04:04 - at least anytime soon.
04:05 - But, Mastodon is an open-source,
04:08 - decentralized social network
and it probably resembles
04:13 - Twitter the most but
there's some nuance to that.
04:15 - So how is it different?
04:16 - How does it work?
04:17 - Well number one is there
is no single server.
04:20 - For example I have actually
set up my own server
04:23 - known as an instance.
04:26 - And I'm not going to
show you in this series
04:28 - how to set up your own Mastodon instance,
04:30 - but if that's of interest
I certainly can provide
04:32 - some resources to do that
and I could do a video
04:34 - about setting one up.
04:35 - My instance is at a particular
domain, choochoo.space,
04:43 - this is my Mastodon instance,
04:45 - so we'll call it Choo Choo.
04:47 - There are other Mastodon instances.
04:50 - For example mastodon.social,
there is also,
04:56 - let me erase some of this stuff here.
04:59 - choochoo, mastodon.social,
there are some other ones
05:03 - that I have seen, for
example, there is vis.social
05:08 - which is an instance for people interested
05:10 - in data visualization I presume.
05:12 - There is another instance
called botsin.space
05:18 - which I am going to use in this series
05:19 - to make a bot that runs
on this botsin.space.
05:22 - So the idea here is I've
set up this instance.
05:24 - Let's say you want to
sign up for an account
05:27 - with this particular instance.
05:28 - You would go, I'll show
you to in a second,
05:29 - you would go there and you would sign up.
05:31 - And so my user name, I'm
a client, my like picture
05:36 - of my like laptop over
here which is strangely,
05:38 - it's a weird bizarre angle,
I am shiffman@choochoo.space.
05:48 - So this is my local, this is
my local Mastodon instance.
05:53 - When I want to sign on, when
I want to post something,
05:56 - I post it, a sign on through this server,
05:59 - I post it through this server,
06:00 - my account is with this server.
06:02 - But there is this concept
called federation,
06:06 - sounds like something out of Star Trek,
06:09 - and it kind of is, which federation,
06:11 - and I know I'm kind of getting close
06:12 - to writing off the top,
06:13 - is a way for all of these instances
06:16 - to communicate with each other
06:18 - in a decentralized fashion.
06:22 - So if I post something saying like, hello,
06:26 - I ate oatmeal for breakfast this morning,
06:30 - this post that I make through here
06:33 - will get propagated throughout
06:34 - the entire network of Mastodon instances.
06:37 - So there is both, when
you're browsing Mastodon
06:41 - there's both this idea of a local timeline
06:44 - as well as a federated,
or you could think of it
06:46 - as global timeline.
06:47 - And I'll show you this in a second.
06:48 - I could browse and just
look at all the posts,
06:51 - I think they're called
toots, all the toots,
06:55 - for people who are at this instance
06:56 - or all the toots from
people all throughout
06:58 - the federated universe of instances.
07:01 - By the way the protocol that is used
07:03 - for all of this, for all the communication
07:07 - to propagate throughout the network,
07:09 - did I mention this already?
07:11 - It's called ActivityPub.
07:14 - So the software that
runs a particular server
07:16 - is completely open-source.
07:18 - It took me awhile to get it up and running
07:20 - but I have it up and running here.
07:21 - So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you
07:23 - my account here, I'm going
to show you botsin.space,
07:25 - which is an instance designed for people
07:28 - who want to make bots.
07:29 - I'm going to sign up and
create a bot on botsin.space
07:31 - and interact with it here
and then just show you
07:33 - how the global network of stuff works.
07:35 - So, the only prerequisites really for you
07:39 - going to the next video
is to have node installed
07:43 - on your computer and you can go back
07:44 - and watch my two sort of intro to node
07:46 - for Twitter bots videos
07:48 - and the same concepts there will apply
07:50 - although I'm going to use
different node packages.
07:52 - Okay, so now we're over here.
07:54 - This is the joinmastodon.org website.
07:57 - You can find out a lot of information.
07:58 - I would encourage you to click on this,
08:00 - How it works, what is mastodon video
08:02 - which is on YouTube which
will explain all that
08:04 - much better then I did, get started.
08:06 - You could find an instance
that you might like to join.
08:10 - This is the GitHub open-source repository
08:14 - with the software that's running.
08:15 - Now, and now, dadadadadadada,
here is my instance.
08:20 - (whistle tooting)
08:21 - The choochoo, people are notifying me
08:24 - and saying hi and look, K. Wichmann
08:27 - says, Look ma, I'm on the live stream.
08:28 - Okay, excellent, please use
caution when posting now.
08:36 - So this is what it looks like.
08:37 - You can see it looks like some other
08:38 - social network service
that you might sigh up for.
08:41 - The difference is I am
actually running the software
08:43 - for it on my own server.
08:45 - This is a server I happened to sign up
08:46 - through DigitalOcean, which
is a web hosting company,
08:49 - that is not a sponsor
but could be a sponsor,
08:51 - hello DigitalOcean, but and
you could set up your own.
08:57 - And so what, but here's
what I'm going to do.
09:00 - You can look other
instances like botsin.space,
09:03 - this is the instance
and you could sign up.
09:05 - In the next video I'm
actually going to sign up
09:06 - for an account here so I can make a bot
09:08 - that posts on it.
09:09 - You can see here's some bots already
09:12 - that are posting things.
09:13 - The Cyberpainting
biedermeier in the North Pole
09:15 - inspired by Hubert Robert.
09:17 - Ah, okay, the sequel is here, get ready
09:19 - for guards 2: define.
09:21 - I don't know what, please,
have a tree picture.
09:23 - This is a tree bot, come on,
oh, let's make a tree bot
09:26 - it's going to be so nice.
09:28 - So again, these are things that you can do
09:29 - on other services but
Mastodon being open-source,
09:33 - it's a really friendly and easy place
09:36 - to get started with in terms of the API
09:38 - which I'm sure will rapidly change,
09:40 - and who knows how quickly this video
09:41 - will go out of date, but
that's the current spot.
09:44 - So if you want to sign
for a Mastodon account
09:46 - not on choochoo.space or botsin.space,
09:52 - a new one for yourself, you can come,
09:53 - you can go to joinmastodon.org
09:55 - and you can go look here.
09:57 - You can look for something
like, oh, you're an artist,
09:59 - yes, and you speak English.
10:02 - Oh, this dots social, there we go,
10:03 - a social space for anyone
10:04 - in data visualization,
creative coding, etc.,
10:07 - and now you can see this is vis.social
10:09 - and you could sign up here.
10:10 - Now once again even if you
sign up at a certain instance,
10:13 - that's just your name and
address and your local instance,
10:16 - but through federation,
through ActivityPub,
10:18 - through decentralization,
you are still participating
10:21 - in the broader world that is a Mastodon.
10:24 - Okay, so what's going to happen next?
10:26 - In the next video I am going to sign up
10:28 - for a botsin.space account,
10:30 - I'm going to show you
how to get your API keys,
10:32 - I'm going to write a little node program
10:33 - that posts, that toots to it automatically
10:36 - and then I'm going to
show you lots more ways
10:38 - and things and how the API
works and different ways
10:40 - to post images and replies
and favorite things
10:42 - and all that kind of stuff, okay?
10:43 - So hope you enjoyed this exploration
10:46 - of the open-source project Mastodon,
10:48 - and I look forward to
hearing what you think
10:50 - in the comments.
10:51 - (upbeat music)
