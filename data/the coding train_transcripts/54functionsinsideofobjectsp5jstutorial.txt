00:00 - okay so this video I'm kind of sneaking
00:03 - in it's like a huge topic and so
00:06 - particularly excited about this one I
00:07 - think this is going to make if you're if
00:09 - you're kind of following along here this
00:10 - is going to majorly change the way you
00:12 - might approach building certain kind of
00:14 - quick sketches in JavaScript and in p5
00:17 - so let's take a look at the scenario
00:20 - it's like a little tight in a way it's
00:22 - like a small change I'm going to make to
00:24 - this particular sketch than the show you
00:26 - in a moment but it's a major leap
00:27 - forward conceptually in terms of how you
00:30 - think about and build sketches now this
00:32 - is certainly I'm a like way too much
00:34 - exposition here but this almost
00:36 - definitely needs many follow ups but
00:38 - let's see how far I get in this video
00:40 - and see what happens from there since
00:43 - I'm really just in a room talking myself
00:45 - but at some point I will hear from
00:47 - people who are watching this okay so
00:49 - let's look at this example so this is a
00:51 - variation of the bouncing ball sketch
00:53 - that I showed in a previous video I
00:55 - simplified it a little bit this is now a
00:57 - bubble it's an object it has just an X
01:01 - and a Y and then the program is modular
01:04 - monetized into two functions a move and
01:06 - a display function the move function
01:09 - adjust the x and a y by the random value
01:12 - and you can see here that it's kind of
01:14 - just like jittering randomly and then
01:16 - the display function down here just
01:17 - draws the circle so this is what we've
01:20 - got a bubble object and a move in a
01:21 - display function the leap forward that I
01:24 - want to make here is I want the code
01:26 - ultimately to not look like this in draw
01:30 - but I want it to look like this bubble
01:33 - move bubble dot display so right now
01:37 - this bubble is just some data it's just
01:40 - the XY location but I want to think of
01:43 - the bubble as a kind of more than just
01:45 - some data that bubble is an object that
01:48 - has an x and a y and it also has
01:50 - functionality it can know how to display
01:52 - itself you can know how to move itself
01:54 - and this will open up a lot of
01:55 - possibilities for example eventually
01:57 - we'll see how you might just release
01:59 - like a thousand of these bubble objects
02:01 - onto the screen all at once so how do we
02:04 - define the function how do we start how
02:06 - do we define this object so not only
02:08 - does it have a bubble X and a bubble Y
02:11 - but that this move
02:12 - function is somehow a part of the bubble
02:14 - object so let's I'm going to diagram
02:16 - some syntax here so okay so this is the
02:20 - syntax for the object VAR bubble equals
02:25 - open curly bracket close curly bracket X
02:29 - which is a filled aura it's really like
02:34 - a variable inside of the bubble object X
02:37 - :
02:38 - I think I was 200 comma Y : 150 and
02:44 - again an object contained in java script
02:47 - contains what's known as name value or
02:50 - sometimes referred to as key value pairs
02:52 - this is the name X this is the value 200
02:55 - and this really behaves just like a
02:58 - variable does it's kind of like this
02:59 - list of variables that's inside this
03:01 - other variable called bubble so the
03:03 - secret magic wonderful thing about
03:05 - javascript is that these don't have to
03:09 - just be values they can be functions so
03:12 - what would happen if I said okay here
03:15 - this name value pair is not named value
03:20 - it is name value but that value is a
03:21 - function so the name is display and the
03:24 - value is function so syntax is kind of
03:30 - hopefully when I type this out it will
03:32 - look a little neater than this but you
03:34 - can see name value name function so this
03:37 - looks different right normally we would
03:41 - say you know function display like this
03:46 - but here just like normally we would say
03:49 - var X instead of saying var X its X
03:52 - colon instead of saying function display
03:54 - its display colon function now sort of
03:58 - unfortunate truth is there's lots of
04:00 - other ways that you can write and define
04:02 - functions in JavaScript and some of
04:04 - those will come up later as well but for
04:06 - the moment now we're seeing one new way
04:08 - this bubble has an X and a Y and a
04:11 - display function so what happens that
04:15 - we've got to fill in the code here
04:16 - inside for this function I want to draw
04:19 - an ellipse the question is where do I
04:22 - want to draw that ellipse I want to
04:24 - at this X and this why did that by
04:29 - accident but I realized I'm sort of
04:30 - doing it on purpose
04:31 - so the we this is the one of the
04:32 - weirdest things it's going to take some
04:34 - time to get used to and hopefully some
04:37 - follow-up videos I make will clarify
04:39 - this new term I'm like having this like
04:44 - thing go in my brain because I'm saying
04:45 - this new term and the term is actually
04:47 - this like the word this that's what
04:49 - getting to so in order to refer back to
04:51 - this X and this why you can't say x and
04:54 - y here these X and y if there were an x
04:57 - and y here would be it would be looking
04:59 - for some global variables summer you
05:00 - need to in order to refer to the
05:02 - specific X that's part of this object
05:05 - this is a keyword that refers to this
05:08 - particular bubble so this dot X comma
05:12 - this dot Y and this is like one of the
05:14 - biggest gotchas so to speak in job
05:16 - scream it's so easy to forget and then
05:18 - you might have like 20 comma Tori so
05:20 - might be so easy to forget this kind of
05:22 - thing so now that you've said this
05:25 - bubble with an X and a Y and a display
05:27 - function which does this draws this
05:29 - ellipse head fits X abyss Y then we can
05:33 - start to write things like bubble dot
05:36 - display when you execute bubble dot
05:39 - display it's going to look up this
05:40 - function execute this code and look for
05:43 - the what these values are here in these
05:45 - particular variables okay so let's try
05:47 - to make that happen here hopefully I got
05:50 - this right so now I'm going to say a
05:53 - display function and actually I could
05:58 - just go and grab exactly this code that
06:00 - we had here I'm going to delete this and
06:04 - bring it up here and the difference now
06:07 - of course is that here I have an X which
06:10 - is 300 or Y just you under display which
06:12 - is a function which does all this right
06:14 - I'm inside the object so there's no
06:17 - reason for me to refer to the objects
06:19 - variable name all I could just say this
06:22 - this particular object that I'm inside
06:24 - right now then the next name value pair
06:28 - comma move which is also a function and
06:33 - I'm going to grab this code
06:37 - and again this dot X this Y this dot X
06:43 - this dot Y so now we see this entire
06:47 - object here the bubble object this is
06:50 - this is like now we have this thing this
06:53 - it's it's not it's like this collection
06:55 - of stuff it's data I could add colors to
06:57 - it I could add size so I could and other
06:59 - functions to it I have this bubble fun
07:03 - bubble object has both data and
07:05 - functionality so now here in draw I can
07:08 - say things like bubble move and bubble
07:10 - dot display now I wonder why display is
07:12 - syntax highlighted there it's not part
07:14 - of p5 it must be display must be some
07:17 - other keyword in JavaScript so I wonder
07:19 - if that's a little bit dangerous for me
07:20 - to use it but I think it'll be ok so
07:22 - let's run this program we have exactly
07:24 - the same program it works just fine and
07:28 - also uh this might also be actually I'm
07:32 - not going to do this next I'm not sure
07:33 - how the b5j has editor works so anyway
07:36 - you know I've actually never like this
07:38 - is like the first time I tried doing
07:40 - this object stuff in JavaScript in this
07:42 - way at least explaining it so I'm not
07:44 - sure how that was but this is just the
07:45 - first first step and so you know if you
07:49 - had to have a second one of these you'd
07:51 - still you'd have to essentially
07:52 - duplicate all this code so that might be
07:55 - something that you try right now
07:56 - actually try making an object like this
07:59 - like this particular one this bubble
08:01 - maybe you know copy this code and add a
08:04 - color to it add another function to it
08:07 - maybe a function that do something if it
08:09 - like reaches the edge of the screen or
08:11 - something although with this randomness
08:12 - it might take a while so see what else
08:14 - you can add to it see if you can make
08:16 - one program that has two objects in it
08:18 - and then at some point I'm going to make
08:21 - a video that's going to look at
08:22 - something called an array which allows
08:24 - you to have a list of variables and one
08:26 - thing you can do very convenient with
08:27 - the rise of a list of objects and
08:29 - there's more there's a lot more you to
08:31 - get to in terms of how these objects are
08:33 - made and stored but I'm rambling now so
08:35 - hopefully this helps a little bit and
08:36 - let me know what you think and I'm going
08:38 - to hit stop now
08:43 - I've really hitting stop this is
08:44 - actually a short video for such a big
08:46 - job
