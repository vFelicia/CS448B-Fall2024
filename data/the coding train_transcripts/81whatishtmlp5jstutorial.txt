00:03 - Hello! So I today I'm starting a new an
entirely new section of videos about a
00:07 - topic i really don't know anything about.
I have no business making this video but
00:12 - i'm going to make an attempt at you the
internet will I don't know why pointing
00:16 - and I like aggressive manner. I
welcome you with a hug but you the
00:21 - internet will hopefully leave comments
and let me know what I've got wrong and
00:25 - what I'm missing here. Because 
honestly this is stuff which has been
00:28 - some new to me as well so in the topic
is ... it probably says it's somewhere on this
00:33 - webpage that I'm sitting in but HTML.
HTML what is that? CSS what is that? Dom
00:39 - what is that? How do you write JavaScript
to control this stuff and making you
00:43 - know magic happen on a webpage so uh
there's a and all of this in the context
00:48 - of a JavaScript framework known as p5. So in this first video all I want to
00:53 - talk about is HTML and I want to open a
p5 sketch if you've been watching the
00:57 - previous videos have been we've been
writing code in this function set up and
01:01 - draw and making things happen on the
screen and making objects and snow and
01:04 - particle system and rainbows of all
sorts of wonderful things but now i want
01:08 - to take a step to peel back some layers
that was actually happening before the
01:12 - JavaScript even execute and what's
happening is this thing known as HTML so
01:19 - actually there wasn't oh I can't even
see that but that's okay
01:22 - There was a moment of time in a previous video... here I am... this is my list by the way to
01:26 - make a whole bunch of these videos there was a moment in time I gotta close the
01:29 - screen which has me on it
01:30 - there was a moment in time in a previous video where I went to that Settings icon
01:35 - and I clicked on the Settings icon and
then I clicked on this show sidebar
01:41 - button and we saw... here look at that! There's this file called index.html and
01:47 - if you recall
01:48 - oh that camera shut off. Stop everybody! Back after a moment of technical
01:54 - difficulties,
01:55 - What I was referring to here is in this
HTML file this gobbledygook there is
01:59 - this line that refers to the javascript
file the javascript file being in our in
02:04 - our world in the world that we lived in
previous to this video this is all that
02:08 - existed set up and draw but the
02:10 - only reason setup runs and draw runs. There's two reasons one reason is up
02:15 - here that p5 Js is a library that's
referred to in a script tag and
02:22 - sketch.js which is our code is referred
to in a script tag so this is actually
02:26 - the file that matters
02:28 - this HTML files the file that matters
what goes in that file
02:32 - how does that file work and what might
you be able to do with that file to make
02:36 - certain things happen so now we come
back over here videos a disaster up and
02:42 - talk about HTML for a second so HTML
stands for hypertext markup language
02:47 - it's a markup language meaning I don't
know what that means somebody somebody
02:52 - sprayed the comments what that means but
the idea here is that it is based on
02:56 - this concept of a tag so um so if you
have some characters in between a less
03:05 - than and a greater than symbol this is a tag.
The HTML tag begins and it ends with a
03:11 - backslash HTML so i have now created
this body this I shouldn't use the word
03:17 - body because that's going to be something more
specific in a moment but i have created
03:20 - this area where I'm going to start to
put some content all in between these
03:26 - tags now some things that might exist
here is going to say another tag maybe a
03:32 - tag known as body and inside that body I
might put some other things I might put
03:39 - a tag with a p for paragraph this is a paragraph and I might put another tag
03:49 - like above that H one which is a
header like title of page then I might
03:57 - put another tag which is like image
source equals apple . jpg so they're all
04:05 - these things that can go in HTML page
this is the mark-up the source code the
04:11 - behind-the-scenes information and
structure behind what you will actually
04:15 - see on the page this
04:20 - renders [that was a bad pen]
04:23 - this renders to on the page title of
page this is a paragraph and then a
04:32 - picture of an apple assuming i have that
file. So the idea here is that you can
04:37 - create full content and layout by by this sort of system of nested tags i have an
04:44 - HTML page in that page there's a body in that body there's ... oh and i wrote
04:50 - something wrong here... that close to
actually be a header there's a header a
04:53 - paragraph an image so one of the things
that can go in here also is a canvas and
05:00 - and p5 inserts the canvas on that page with the function create canvas. So there's
05:06 - this kind of question here is like well
what what what is it ok right here
05:11 - what's going on with my life and what am
I trying to do if you just want to
05:15 - present some content some content that
you want to type you have an essay you
05:19 - wrote your story wrote it has a title
and has some pictures in it and it's
05:23 - sort of like static or you might say
flat just from existing content you can
05:28 - put that all into an HTML document open
that HTML content in a browser and you
05:33 - will see it there if you want this page
to be interactive or dynamic behaviour
05:38 - change over time change when a user
clicks animate whatever strange
05:43 - experimental thing you can think of
that's where you need javascript so this
05:48 - is the purpose of my set of videos here
is to look at but we you know hopefully
05:53 - you know a little bit about JavaScript
down you can program and make these
05:55 - little animations what's the page behind
that better hold which one is the page
06:01 - where that javascript is acting on how
do you put stuff in the page how to put
06:05 - stuff in the javascript javascript and
how do those two things talk to each
06:08 - other
06:09 - ok so here's sort of basic idea of HTML
06:13 - now let's walk home first locally here
over to this computer and I'm gonna do
06:18 - something crazy which is I'm just going
to say like nevermind ub5 editor and
06:24 - whatever HTML you made for me
automatically i'm going to take all of
06:27 - this out i'm going to close this
preferences and i'm going to say i'm
06:31 - going to say i want to have a body
06:33 - and I want to have a header I and making
a video and I want to have a paragraph
06:42 - this is my essay about how I love to
make videos they are hard pocket pay for
06:50 - it i'm just like lost the train of
thought battery i'm steve got just
06:53 - favorite thing to do
06:55 - rainbow rainbow rainbow which is my
thing that I always just use rainbow
07:01 - ok so you can see I'm starting to just
put content in this HTML page and i'm
07:06 - going to run it and look at this
07:08 - I now looks like i wrote a program that
made this but I didn't I just manually
07:14 - added some content of the HTML page what
the mp5 actually loads in this window in
07:19 - this like little browser window is the
HTML file and so you could say like well
07:23 - what's in the javascript file nothing
but i could add create canvas 200 200
07:29 - and I could add a background 0 Phil to
5500 i'm also now lost my train of
07:38 - thought of programming rectangle 00 you
know 100-150 50 I've got some JavaScript
07:45 - I've got some HTML and now whoops now
let me run this again or load this page
07:50 - again and we can see here huh where is
the canvas it doesn't exist so nothing
07:57 - actually happens on the page unless it's
included in the HTML file and when I
08:03 - wiped the HTML file that the editor made
for me automatically i took out all the
08:08 - references to that javascript file so if
i want to have both the HTML content and
08:14 - the javascript stuff happening at the
same time I need to put I need to have
08:18 - both of those things so let me introduce
a little we're just going to make a new
08:21 - project and we look at HTML file and I'm
going to grab this header area i'm going
08:28 - to grab this close that so what's
missing from this document HTML body is
08:35 - a head tag and a head tag is where i
might reference other files like
08:39 - JavaScript files and other things that
you might see later on if I ever get to
08:44 - making some videos that make any sense
08:46 - So, I'm going to paste that back in here
you can see in this you can see now this
08:50 - page both and I'm gonna gonna take out this stuff here some extra stuff i'm now
08:55 - this page and i don't actually i'm not
using these libraries well i'll leave it
08:58 - there
08:59 - this now you can see this page is
referring to the p5 library and some
09:02 - other libraries that I'll mention a
second our JavaScript code and the HTML
09:06 - stuff that I added and now if I run this
or load this page again you can see look
09:11 - at this
09:11 - we now have other content around the canvas so this is the first step right
09:17 - How do you make content written to the HTML file? How do you use
09:23 - p5js and JavaScript to make a canvas?
How do both those things exist in the
09:27 - same at p5js project and the next step
is what's the interplay between those
09:33 - two things? Wwhat if i want this header text to change when i click the mouse?
09:37 - What if i want the font to change at
when the rectangle moving across the
09:41 - canvas gets to the other side of the
screen?
09:43 - These are the kinds of questions I hope to answer and make more clear in the
09:48 - next set of videos. There's a couple
things that I missed here so that I
09:52 - think are important before i finish so
one thing i want to mention about this
09:55 - you know what I could come back to this
later you know because I i want to
09:59 - mention is how this is a tree structure
I said I would come back to later but now that I
10:02 - said I have to talk about it
10:04 - so this is a tree structure and this is
also something that's important to think
10:07 - about the root node of this tree is HTML inside of HTML there's a body right open
10:20 - tag close tag inside of the body there's
a header a paragraph an image editor a
10:28 - paragraph and an image is a paragraph
could have things inside the paragraph
10:33 - as we saw in in the HTML file there was
actually a head tag which included some
10:38 - scripts javascript scripts and other
things so this is an important also way
10:44 - of thinking and I think I think nobody's
been watching the ad know if you're
10:50 - still watching this video let me know
because I don't know going on for a long
10:53 - time but I'm this I think is a clue to
this idea of something known as
10:58 - the DOM... document object model this I don't actually know what the DOM is but
11:05 - I think I have an idea just by talking
this through... this is a document these
11:10 - are objects inside the document the
model is this tree structure of how a
11:16 - page is structured. There's an HTML
element but object inside of it there's
11:23 - a body object inside of it there's a
head h1 object a paragraph object and
11:26 - image object this whole document has a model structure for how to organize of
11:32 - objects document object model and how do
you manipulate that document dom
11:37 - manipulation means how to use JavaScript to manipulate this on the fly in real
11:40 - time
11:41 - this is the subject i hope to continue
to cover and make more and more examples
11:45 - of now one thing I should admit here is this is like two most pathetic or like
11:49 - tiniest like explanation of HTML ever
looked like a few things so I'm really
11:54 - hoping to get two more about javascript programming and manipulation in real
11:59 - time if you're interested in HTML
12:02 - right on anyway we knows of HTML write in the comments of nice some links i
12:06 - might include but I'm i try to refer you
to the other sources like what are all
12:10 - the possible tags
12:12 - how are these tags organized how are
they different you know what does it
12:14 - mean to have this source equals Apple
jpg this is an attribute will get to
12:18 - some of these things as i get further
along through these videos as well so
12:21 - for you if you're kind of following
along in the sort of like watch a video
12:24 - to a quick exercise ... what I would say is see if you can make this happen make now
12:29 - take one of your p5 sketches and add
some other stuff around it around the
12:33 - page we're going to be able to do a lot
more than mixing it soon but this is
12:37 - only been about 10 minutes this video I feel like I'm talking for like 45
12:40 - minutes and that i think would be a good start. In the next video I i'm going to
12:46 - look at my list here the next video I'm
going to look at making DOM elements
12:53 - making HTML elements on the fly from JavaScript adding them to the page just
12:57 - like create canvas and add to the page
12:59 - okay i'm going to hit stop on recording
and
13:03 - go on to the next video.
