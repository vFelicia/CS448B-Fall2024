00:01 - So this is the second in a
series of videos about arrays.
00:05 - And what I would like to
look at in this video--
00:07 - oh, yes.
00:07 - I'm in the right place--
00:08 - is this particular piece of code
and augmenting it a little bit.
00:11 - So let's look at
this for a second.
00:14 - And I've got this sketch here
that's drawing two circles.
00:17 - So before, I was demonstrating
here's a single variable.
00:20 - I can just use that
single variable directly
00:22 - and draw a circle with the value
of that variable as the width.
00:25 - Or I can access an
individual element
00:27 - in the array via
its index, 0, 1, 2.
00:30 - So this ellipse has a
diameter of 46 pixels.
00:34 - So what I would
like to do is I'm
00:36 - going to get rid of
this, which was just
00:38 - for showing the difference
between a variable
00:40 - and an array.
00:40 - And what I'm going to
do is say, OK, well,
00:42 - let's actually draw
all these ellipses,
00:44 - use all the values in the array.
00:46 - So I'm going to start at 100
and use the zero element.
00:50 - Then I'll go to 200 and
use the index one element.
00:54 - Then I'll go to 300
and use the next two.
00:57 - A little bit of copy-pasting.
00:59 - And we can see
here, 200, 300, 400.
01:04 - I should probably make the
canvas 500 pixels wide.
01:06 - And run this.
01:07 - And look at that.
01:08 - Wonderful.
01:08 - I have four eclipses,
each with a diameter
01:13 - using a value from the array.
01:14 - The first value is 100.
01:15 - The second one is 25.
01:16 - The third one's 46.
01:18 - And the fourth one is 72.
01:19 - And those ellipses look
like they're right.
01:21 - So you can see here that I can
use every element of the array
01:24 - and repeat the same
thing over and over
01:26 - and over again with the
elements of the array.
01:28 - And with a little copy-pasting,
it works just fine.
01:30 - And everybody's happy.
01:31 - You do a little dance, like
the little code works dance.
01:34 - And there you go.
01:37 - But there's a problem here.
01:39 - This works with four.
01:40 - But if you had 400, you
won't be happy dancing.
01:43 - You'll be copying and pasting.
01:45 - You'll have carpal
tunnel syndrome.
01:46 - And things will be very
uncomfortable in your life.
01:49 - However, there is a
solution to this problem.
01:51 - And you might remember
it from a previous video,
01:55 - the for loop video.
01:56 - So we could use a loop.
01:58 - A loop is a method for
counting and repeating a task.
02:00 - And you can see here that
this line of code is repeated.
02:04 - It's really the same
line of code every time.
02:05 - The only things
that are different
02:06 - are the x location and
the index into the array.
02:09 - So let's come over here.
02:11 - And let's remind
ourselves-- whoever we are,
02:15 - I'm going to remind
myself and maybe you're
02:17 - watching-- what a for loop is.
02:20 - So I could write for and then
I could say var i equals 0.
02:26 - I could say i is less than 4.
02:30 - i plus plus.
02:32 - Now I should mention there's
no actual requirement that you
02:35 - use the variable named i.
02:37 - It's just sort of a convention.
02:38 - You could say j or
n or cat or apple.
02:42 - It doesn't matter.
02:43 - This is a variable name
that you're making up.
02:45 - And the way a for loop
works is if you start with 0
02:52 - then you check to see
if 0 is less than 4,
02:56 - you execute a
task, go up by one,
02:59 - check to see if it's still
less than 4, execute a task,
03:02 - go up by one, check to see
if it's still less than 4,
03:05 - execute a task, go
up by one, check
03:07 - to see if it's less than 4.
03:08 - By the way if it's
not less than 4,
03:09 - you're done and stop
executing that task.
03:11 - So if I were to say something
like print ln i right here,
03:17 - I would start at 0.
03:18 - i is less than 4.
03:20 - So I would see 0 printed out.
03:22 - If this is the console, I would
see 0 appear in the console.
03:25 - Then I would go up by one.
03:26 - i would be 1.
03:28 - 1 is less than 4.
03:29 - It would get printed out.
03:30 - I would go by one,
2 is less than 4.
03:33 - Then it would go up by
one, 3 is less than 4.
03:35 - Then it would go up
by one, 4-- aha--
03:37 - 4 is not less than 4.
03:39 - The loop would exit.
03:41 - So this is the
result that I see.
03:43 - This line of code
executes four times--
03:46 - first with the value of
0, then with the value 1,
03:48 - then with the value 2,
then with the value 3 in i.
03:51 - Look at this over here.
03:53 - I'm coming back to you.
03:55 - Over here, this line of
code executes four times,
04:00 - first with the value of
0, then with the value 1,
04:02 - then with the value 2,
then with the value 3.
04:05 - Exactly what we did here.
04:06 - So there's no reason
why I couldn't instead
04:11 - say for var i equals 0, i
is less than 4, i plus plus,
04:18 - and then take this line
of code and say, i and i.
04:25 - Remember, the index into
an array can be a variable.
04:28 - So let me comment this out.
04:31 - And you can see I'm making the
case to you that this is 100%--
04:35 - except for one
thing that I forgot
04:37 - which we'll fix in a second--
04:38 - equivalent to this.
04:39 - This I wrote each line
of code out manually,
04:42 - manually typing in
the index 0, 1, 2, 3.
04:44 - Here, this line of code is
being repeated four times.
04:47 - And the index is dynamic.
04:49 - It's 0, it's 1, it's 2, it's 3.
04:51 - So I should see four
ellipses in the window,
04:53 - just like we had before.
04:57 - I see kind of like a couple.
04:59 - And I don't really
what's going on there.
05:01 - Let me add something here.
05:02 - Let me say, stroke
255 and no fill.
05:05 - Let's try to look
at what's going on.
05:07 - So this really did work.
05:09 - Wow, I really sized those
in such a lovely way.
05:12 - But there are four
circles there.
05:14 - And one is 100 pixels wide, one
is 25 pixels wide, one is 46,
05:18 - one is 72.
05:19 - The issue is they're all
in the same location.
05:22 - So here notice how x changed--
05:23 - 100, 200, 300, 400.
05:25 - But x doesn't change here.
05:26 - It's 100 for each one.
05:27 - How do we deal with that?
05:28 - Well, interestingly enough,
if I come back over here,
05:32 - these values I had--
05:33 - 0, 1, 2, 3--
05:35 - what if I were to multiply each
one of these values by 100?
05:42 - What would I get?
05:43 - And let me give myself a
little more space here.
05:46 - I would get 0 times 100 is 0.
05:51 - 1 times 100 is--
05:52 - say it with me, even though
we're not together but just do
05:55 - it--
05:55 - 100, 200, 300.
06:00 - So that's close.
06:01 - 0, 100, 200, 300.
06:02 - What did I have?
06:05 - 100, 200, 300, 400.
06:09 - Let's add 100 to each of these.
06:12 - If I add 100 to
each of these, that
06:15 - means I have 100, 200, 300, 400.
06:20 - So by taking that index
value, multiplying it by 100,
06:25 - adding 100, I have the
values that I want.
06:28 - So I, even though
I'm using it to count
06:31 - through the indices
of an array, it's
06:32 - just this like counting
number, I can use it for good,
06:36 - for other purposes.
06:37 - So here we go.
06:38 - I could say, instead
of drawing them at 100,
06:41 - I could say i
times 100 plus 100.
06:44 - And now if we run
this, I kind of
06:47 - want to have them have a
little more weight to them.
06:49 - I'll make them kind
of grayish inside.
06:52 - You can see there
are my five circles.
06:55 - This worked.
06:56 - This is a way of using an
array to have many elements
07:03 - but applying the same action
to all of those elements.
07:06 - And if you remembered, this
is kind of where I began.
07:09 - If these things were
objects not single numbers
07:11 - and I had 1,000 of them, I could
just say display all of them,
07:16 - move all of them,
run all of them.
07:17 - And that's the topic that I
will explore in the next video.
07:21 - For now, I might say, just make
that array of strings perhaps.
07:24 - See if you can display
like five different words
07:27 - in some pattern on the screen.
07:29 - Make a color palette.
07:31 - You have six colors and all
the things you're drawing,
07:33 - you always pick a random
color for a bunch of those.
07:36 - Actually, that's
what I said before.
07:37 - Loop through and draw--
07:39 - I know, make another array with
colors for each one of these.
07:42 - And use the color for it.
07:43 - Although in that sense,
I almost would rather
07:45 - use an object for that.
07:46 - But you get the idea.
07:47 - Like make a little riff
off of this as an exercise.
07:50 - But really, I think,
the goal that you
07:52 - might have in your
mind is, as you
07:53 - start to have multiple
parameters for things
07:55 - you're drawing on
the screen, maybe
07:57 - those should be inside objects.
07:59 - Because objects is a
collection of properties.
08:01 - That's the end of
this video, which
08:03 - is eight minutes
long, which I feel
08:04 - like is a victory in some way.
08:06 - Thanks very much.
