05:23 - but let me just quickly give you a few
05:26 - important points about what is going to
05:28 - happen today so this is a celebration of

05:50 - people are saying hello to me that that
05:52 - is the proper and only way to donate to
05:57 - the processing Foundation decade of code
06:00 - fundraiser there are all sorts of other
06:02 - things enabled that are part of the
06:03 - YouTube platform like coding train
06:05 - memberships and super chats please do
06:08 - not use those to donate to the uh
06:10 - processing Foundation they won't go to
06:12 - the processing Foundation if you happen
06:13 - to do a super chat today for whatever
06:15 - reason I will redirect that money
06:17 - personally to the processing Foundation
06:20 - but if you what as we start to talk
06:22 - about the fundraiser and you see some of
06:24 - the benefits uh exciting swag things
06:27 - just going to drink from my mug here no

06:36 - donor box link that is in the uh video
06:42 - description as well as a pinned message
06:45 - in the chat and apparently Dave is

06:50 - little suspicious of this message um
06:54 - rapael can you hear
06:57 - me yes okay now the audience can cannot
06:59 - hear you yet I I guess I I guess I
07:01 - spoiled it there but I'm going to now
07:03 - bring in our guest and I have to
07:05 - apologize in advance uh rapael dorville
07:08 - who is a community lead with the proing
07:10 - foundation who is here to join today's
07:12 - live stream we're going to have all
07:13 - sorts of fun coding some collaborative
07:15 - p5js together as well as talking my
07:19 - audio is very low yeah everybody always
07:21 - turn your volume up people my volume is
07:24 - fine it's you no I'm just kidding I know
07:27 - it's a little bit of an issue I will
07:28 - turn it up I'm always paranoid about
07:31 - clipping but actually Raphael helped me
07:34 - uh with some new OBS settings so my
07:37 - volume I just actually that that might
07:39 - have been the wrong button I have so
07:40 - many dials and things I'm really not
07:44 - very good at this whole technical thing
07:47 - and I have to really thank Raphael who
07:48 - spent a good hour with me this morning
07:51 - helping me configure open broadcast
07:53 - studio I added all these buttons to my
07:55 - stream deck we have multiple scenes with
07:58 - both of us with Rafael only so let me
08:01 - stop uh just vamping here and bring in
08:04 - our guest so that you can at least see
08:06 - and hear him and I'm hopefully G to
08:08 - press the correct button that's going to
08:09 - do this correctly aha yes so Rafael you
08:12 - are now live say something to make sure
08:14 - your audio is going through say hello to
08:16 - the coding train audience hello hello
08:19 - coding train chirp chirp and I can see
08:23 - already just the levels here that you
08:25 - are a little bit louder than me so I'm
08:26 - I'm just adjusting it so um
08:30 - uh hopefully uh you can continue to let
08:32 - us know in the chat about the audio
08:34 - levels uh you know you might be thinking
08:36 - you're watching some kind of
08:37 - professional operation here but it's
08:39 - just little old me in my garage by the
08:41 - way uh interesting little tidbit I'm in
08:44 - Upstate New York there is about two feet
08:45 - of snow outside maybe I could take a
08:47 - picture with my phone of the snow and
08:49 - show it on screen in a bit it's
08:51 - remarkable it's incredible and also uh
08:54 - let's all say do our little dance uh to
08:57 - the internet uh
08:59 - uh God's hope that I don't lose like a

10:23 - ago and uh it's nice to be uh on board
10:27 - the coding train today wonderful uh
10:30 - thank you um so while uh um so I
10:35 - realizing we have all these wonderful
10:37 - people from the foundation in the chat
10:40 - and I wonder if I should make them give

10:58 - and then I didn't get very far so if you
11:00 - want to talk for a minute more while I
11:02 - see if I can add some moderator badges
11:04 - here yeah for
11:06 - sure uh yeah so I mean I'm sure a lot of
11:09 - you already know uh about bring
11:12 - Foundation um it's been uh it's been out
11:15 - there for a while processing itself
11:16 - started in 2001 but processing
11:18 - Foundation started later and uh and the
11:21 - fellowships uh which have had uh yeah
11:25 - some uh incredible impact in various
11:27 - ways uh one of which in particular um
11:32 - all of you here are familiar with which
11:35 - is that p5js itself started as a
11:38 - Crossing Foundation Fellowship uh when
11:41 - Lauren started started this project um
11:45 - and yeah since then the fellowships have
11:47 - evolved into into something uh much
11:49 - bigger and uh much more structured as
11:53 - well thanks to tig's work um recently
11:56 - and so yeah we'll but we'll show a video
11:59 - shortly which uh has been um has been
12:02 - made specially for this fundraiser and
12:04 - that shows a little bit like a little
12:06 - preview of what uh what the uh what the
12:10 - fellows have been doing lately it's it's
12:12 - a fantastic video was made by uh Lune I
12:16 - believe um I forgot the last name sorry
12:19 - and but yeah all the credits are on the
12:21 - donation page if you click that link
12:23 - that you see pinned in the chat you will
12:25 - uh you will be able to learn more about
12:27 - the fellowship see the video but we'll
12:29 - play it here as well so and and I pulled
12:31 - it up on screen now so what you're
12:33 - seeing on screen is the donorbox page uh
12:36 - the decade of code fundraiser and um one
12:39 - of the the most important links probably
12:42 - on this page Beyond uh there well
12:43 - there's two links that I think I'd like
12:45 - to share with you um um the processing
12:48 - Foundation fellowship program medium
12:50 - post where you can read all about the
12:51 - most recent 2023 fellows as well as the
12:55 - processing foundation's 2023 uh impact
12:58 - report this is an
13:00 - extraordinary uh piece of work um maybe
13:03 - those of you from the foundation who in
13:05 - the chat could properly credit uh all of
13:08 - the uh PE people uh who who I know that
13:12 - Design Systems International everyone
13:13 - worked on the design of this report um
13:16 - and xiawei worked on a lot of the
13:18 - editing and writing of the report as
13:19 - well as obviously the the board of the
13:21 - foundation and a lot of the staff um I
13:23 - just don't want to miss anybody but if
13:25 - you want to learn more about what is
13:28 - happening with the processing Foundation
13:30 - um in the last couple years not to
13:32 - mention the last 10 to 20 years um this
13:34 - report is incredibly comprehensive I'm
13:36 - just sort of scrolling through it now um
13:39 - so I want to play that video but I
13:41 - thought I would talk just for a minute
13:43 - um about my experience with the
13:45 - processing foundation fellowships so um
13:48 - I was one of the folks who uh you know I
13:51 - I was telling the story the other day to
13:53 - some people who literally I I like to
13:55 - imagine that I was you know somewhere
13:57 - like banging on the door of some giant
13:59 - governmental office with like a giant
14:01 - stack of papers to try to turn the
14:03 - processing Foundation uh into an actual
14:07 - 501c3 uh organization here so I know we
14:09 - have a a global audience here so in the
14:12 - United States there is a category for of
14:16 - tax exempt status for any charity or
14:19 - nonprofit that's what the processing
14:20 - Foundation is um previous to the
14:23 - foundation there was just a you know
14:26 - dispersed uh a group of contributors a
14:30 - volunteer who would work on the
14:32 - processing software which was started by
14:34 - Casey Reese and Ben Fry at the M media
14:37 - lab in 2001 I came into working on
14:40 - processing the Java software in around
14:43 - 2003 when I discovered it as a graduate
14:45 - student at ITP and in 2012 I was lucky
14:49 - to be offered the opportunity to help
14:50 - start the foundation so what we're
14:52 - really celebrating here in this decade
14:54 - of code there's a lot of 10year marks
14:57 - but you could also kind of consider the
14:59 - foundation as having it I mean 2024
15:01 - minus 2012 you know you do the math it's
15:04 - maybe a little bit different than 10
15:06 - years but I think we could also uh kind
15:08 - of point to that as well but one of the
15:10 - reasons for starting the foundation was
15:12 - to be able to do more than just maintain
15:16 - this open source piece of software but
15:18 - really think more deeply about what it
15:21 - means to be in community with the people
15:23 - who are maintaining the software using
15:25 - the software and I know that's something
15:27 - that Lauren McCarthy really talks a lot
15:29 - about and um really did an incredible
15:32 - amount of work hard work uh when
15:35 - creating the P5 project of blurring
15:37 - those lines those lines really shouldn't
15:39 - exist there is no difference between
15:41 - developing in my mind between developing
15:43 - software and the community of people who
15:46 - are developing and using that software
15:48 - and so that I think is where the idea of
15:50 - the fellowship started as a way of
15:52 - providing uh
15:54 - funding and uh mentorship and a
15:57 - structure for projects that are
16:00 - speculative that are experimental that
16:02 - are education oriented that are
16:04 - Community oriented and even though we
16:07 - didn't have such an organized system for
16:09 - an open call and applications and a
16:11 - review process uh you know the that was
16:15 - more ad hoc at that time but that
16:18 - concept that idea is what allowed
16:21 - something like the p5js project to begin
16:23 - and now flourish so um that's just to
16:26 - give you a little bit of background
16:28 - there I don't
16:29 - hopefully there's a lot lot of
16:31 - processing Foundation folks in the
16:33 - audience I guess I I'm kind of still a
16:35 - part of the processing Foundation as an
16:37 - advisor as an enthusiastic uh evangelist
16:41 - to the foundation but I'm one of the
16:43 - things that I'm most excited for you
16:45 - know I uh um is for uh all of the new
16:48 - leadership of the processing Foundation
16:50 - the new project leads uh all of the
16:53 - staff and that is now organizing
16:56 - different programs and Community
16:57 - initiatives and all the finances and so
17:00 - much work in the governance of a
17:01 - nonprofit organization you would be
17:03 - surprised it's not something that that I
17:06 - particularly good at and uh there's a
17:08 - wonderful team of people who are
17:09 - excellent at these things right now uh
17:11 - uh running the the beautiful and
17:13 - wonderful processing Foundation
17:14 - organization so I'm I'm I'm just
17:17 - rambling here and so there was I was
17:19 - trying to make a segue into playing the
17:21 - video is there anything I forgot do you
17:23 - think rough or any questions you want to
17:24 - ask about like you know anything related
17:26 - to the that I might have somewhere in
17:28 - the recesses of my brain around the
17:30 - history of the the projects the
17:31 - foundation and the
17:33 - fellowship uh oh well just one one thing
17:36 - since it's on the screen uh this
17:38 - beautiful uh background which we cannot
17:40 - see too well right now but we'll I'll
17:42 - show all the the desktop backgrounds uh
17:44 - later but this visual that we're using
17:46 - all around the decade of code fundraiser
17:50 - promotion is uh made by Ronnie calman
17:53 - and it's called rainbow ribbons it's
17:56 - beautiful and yeah um I just wanted to
18:00 - give a shout out to roony for this this
18:02 - wonderful work and also to all the
18:03 - artists who made the
18:05 - wallpapers thank you yeah so today is
18:08 - really um meant to be just just like
18:11 - these wallpaper backgrounds and I think
18:13 - maybe um ra will show some more in a
18:15 - minute after I play the video is really
18:17 - just meant to be a celebration um uh we
18:20 - I we I highly encourage you if you're
18:22 - able to if you have the capacity to
18:24 - donate during this stream but just so
18:26 - you're aware we're not getting live
18:28 - notifications there's no uh there's no
18:30 - like old rotary phone that I can pull up
18:32 - and you call in so in the old ton style
18:35 - so but um if you donate uh if you're
18:38 - able to donate thank you so much um and
18:41 - I see I'm seeing all I've seeing names
18:43 - of people I've see roony in the chat who
18:45 - made uh who made this beautiful uh
18:47 - rainbow background so
18:51 - um I'm imagining that maybe some of you
18:55 - watching today might be interested in
18:57 - applying to the processing Foundation
18:59 - fellowship program yourself so what I'd
19:02 - like to do now is play you this short
19:05 - video that is all about the fundraiser
19:09 - the different benefits from the
19:10 - fundraiser uh about the decade of code
19:13 - as well as showcasing the work of the
19:15 - most recent Fellowship cohort I have to
19:18 - say that I was lucky enough to be able
19:20 - to attend the 20123 fellowship Salon um
19:24 - in New York city hosted by uh sigay and
19:27 - it was just an incredible experience to
19:30 - get to meet and see the work of these
19:32 - fellows so I'm so uh thrilled to be able
19:35 - to get to play this video for you now
19:38 - hopefully this is g to work I set
19:40 - everything up I have a button that I
19:42 - press when I press the button the scene
19:44 - is gonna switch it's gon to play that
19:46 - video You're G to hear the audio you
19:48 - won't hear me you won't hear WRA but if
19:51 - anything goes wrong uh you know I'm just
19:54 - letting you know that things tend to go
19:55 - wrong on the coding tree so uh um and
19:59 - yeah so let me just get let without
20:01 - further Ado let's play The Decade of
20:04 - code processing Foundation fundraiser
20:09 - video join the celebration of innovation
20:12 - with the processing foundation's Deca of
20:14 - code the real heart of this I think
20:16 - that's what keeps me going is that this
20:18 - isn't just a coding resource but it's a
20:21 - storytelling resource it's a resource
20:23 - that connects young people together E5
20:26 - processing we have a very friendly
20:28 - Community everyone help each other and
20:30 - support each other think about
20:32 - Technologies differently in a
20:34 - non-mechanical way everybody is an
20:36 - expert in their own environment we're
20:38 - really looking to uplift the voices of
20:40 - those that have been silenced I'm
20:42 - speaking to archival interventions by
20:45 - black Scholars that really um like
20:48 - underscore the urgency of challenging
20:50 - dominant narratives as we hit a
20:53 - remarkable Milestone the 10th
20:54 - anniversary of our fellowship program
20:56 - we're thrilled to unveil our decade of
20:58 - code
21:00 - fundraiser but this isn't just a look
21:02 - back it's a bold Leap Forward into the
21:04 - fusion of Art and Technology your
21:06 - contributions are the Catalyst for our
21:08 - growth in software education and art
21:11 - fostering a community where creativity
21:13 - compassion and Technology Thrive and I
21:15 - think uh processing and p5js are such
21:18 - incredible tools if whether it's a
21:21 - gateway to learn how to code or building
21:24 - the tools that maybe we need to see in
21:26 - our community or in our movements and
21:29 - guess what your generosity comes with
21:31 - perks we are offering an array of
21:33 - exciting rewards including limited
21:36 - edition merchandise digital goodies and

24:17 - you scroll down to the bottom of this
24:18 - page first of all you go bypassing the
24:21 - this is something new that I learned by

25:16 - delicious okay I'm trying to think of oh
25:20 - so maybe what we can do next before we
25:22 - start to do our fun live coding session
25:24 - is if rth what if uh what do you think
25:27 - about me having you take over the screen
25:29 - and talking and showing about some of
25:30 - the wallpapers that were made for the
25:32 - decade of
25:33 - code yeah yeah let's do that um okay
25:37 - this is exciting hold on here we go I
25:38 - got to press the right button there we
25:40 - go we've got a a a much larger Raphael

25:54 - um so yeah the uh uh I'll I'll see it on
25:59 - the stream when uh when when catches up

26:45 - fantastic artist please go and check out
26:47 - her website and and the work that she
26:49 - produces she makes generative art uh
26:52 - absolutely beautiful beautiful stuff and
26:54 - she's a fantastic human being as well um
26:57 - and yeah she made this to represent the
27:00 - blossoming inspiration of generative
27:02 - arts and creative coders uh through the
27:06 - work of the foundation in these last 10
27:07 - years um so yeah this is uh this is a
27:11 - special limited edition one uh and uh
27:14 - and then yeah the rest of the merge
27:16 - you'll have a sticker pack this is not
27:17 - fully representative of all the stickers
27:19 - that will be included but there will be
27:21 - at least those and some more uh tilt bag
27:23 - and this the tech tackle yum yum uh yeah
27:27 - there you go but yeah let's talk about
27:29 - the uh the wallpapers so we asked a
27:33 - number of artists from the community to
27:35 - contribute desktop backgrounds for for
27:38 - people who will donate uh you will get
27:41 - those at any tier of donation uh from
27:44 - the smallest to the largest uh every
27:47 - donation accounts and uh you will also
27:50 - get it if you can't afford to donate at
27:52 - all uh but you want to still get the the
27:55 - desktop background you can you just have
27:58 - to sign up to the newsletter there's a
28:00 - link there as well and if you sign up to
28:02 - the newsletter you will get the link not
28:05 - immediately but in the next newsletter

28:16 - if you donate you get the link
28:18 - immediately just check that the

32:17 - in already thank you to sadra Jenny no
32:22 - uh yeah thanks for your donations um
32:25 - yeah and thanks to all the artists who
32:27 - contributed with their art uh this is
32:30 - something I I definitely want to expand
32:32 - next year for the next fundraiser I
32:34 - think this time we we reached out
32:36 - directly to artists we knew um it was a
32:38 - little bit last minute and so thanks for
32:41 - everybody to to for bearing with us and
32:43 - sending sending making adapting your
32:46 - work for the format and sending it to us
32:48 - very quickly that was uh that was really
32:50 - helpful and I think I'd love more
32:53 - opportunity to showcase the work of the
32:55 - community this is something that
32:57 - uh there will uh there will be more of
33:00 - that in the near future little teaser on
33:02 - the P5 side of things but I don't want
33:04 - to I don't want to Rob Q from the chance
33:07 - to announce these things but we're
33:08 - definitely looking for ways to showcase
33:11 - the community's work and art creation
33:13 - creativity in general uh more even more
33:16 - than we have in the past and in an
33:18 - ongoing way uh but yeah I I'm thinking
33:21 - next year might be fun to have this be
33:23 - more of an open call instead of just
33:25 - reaching out to to specific people Al so
33:27 - we have an even bigger collection uh and
33:30 - if you think of other formats that you
33:31 - think might be fun for for uh virtual
33:34 - rewards uh we have the actual physical
33:36 - merch but now we have these these
33:38 - virtual rewards uh yeah just let us know
33:41 - what you'd like to see and uh we'll
33:43 - we'll figure out how to make it happen
33:46 - uh yeah that's uh that's the that's the
33:50 - collection all right thank you so much
33:53 - I'm so I I want to Pat myself on the
33:55 - back too much I'm so thrilled with these
33:57 - different scenes are working although as
33:58 - you might notice um Raphael is actually
34:01 - we're approximately the same human style
34:05 - size uh uh creature but I know it does
34:07 - appear that rapael is much larger than
34:09 - me it's just our camera views are a
34:11 - little bit different uh but uh but um so
34:14 - thank you so much for taking us through
34:16 - that um I was really it's really amazing
34:18 - and beautiful to see all the wallpapers
34:20 - I mean that to me has been my favorite
34:24 - part of participating in the processing
34:27 - uh Foundation community and as a teacher
34:30 - and somebody who makes video tutorials
34:32 - to me like seeing what people make based
34:36 - off of an example or a lesson or
34:38 - inspired by another artist that chain
34:41 - that tree that branching of creativity
34:43 - that just goes all over uh across all
34:48 - ages and countries and globally and
34:50 - Styles um that's really been just like
34:52 - the greatest thrill for me uh for
34:55 - someone who is teaches with the stuff
34:57 - and has been working with processing and
34:58 - p5js for many years so it's great to see
35:01 - that come to fruition here um in the
35:04 - form of these beautiful wallpapers and I
35:06 - guess you know maybe my children will uh
35:09 - uh will will won't be too offended if I
35:11 - change did I take their photos off of my
35:14 - phone lock screen for just a brief week
35:17 - and put some beautiful uh rainbow uh
35:19 - they're they're old they're like
35:20 - teenagers now they probably don't want
35:22 - to be on my uh phone lock screen anymore
35:24 - I don't know why I'm talking about this
35:26 - um all right so uh yes rapael you're
35:28 - raising your hand you can just talk you
35:30 - should just interrupt me I have a an
35:33 - Affliction which is to just continue to
35:34 - ramble awkwardly and try to fill any
35:37 - possible silence I'm used to doing this
35:39 - by myself no dead air no dead air ever
35:43 - yeah uh that's that thanks and uh one
35:46 - thing there two things I wanted to
35:47 - mention first I wanted to thank Sonia as
35:50 - well for for their incredible work uh
35:52 - coordinating all of this I contacted
35:54 - some of the artists but Sonia was really
35:56 - the one to put all of all of that
35:58 - together in the good format making sure
36:00 - that we have uh the metadata for all of
36:02 - the uh for each of the artist with a
36:05 - little bit of a bio for each of them and
36:07 - their links so if you're interested in
36:09 - knowing more about each artist in the
36:11 - collection there are links in those text
36:13 - files that are that are with it um and
36:17 - uh and yeah and the other thing uh you
36:19 - said uh you you don't want to replace
36:21 - your existing if I I don't know if
36:22 - you're using iOS or Android I don't know
36:25 - much about Android but on the iOS side
36:26 - the thing you can make you can use Focus
36:28 - modes and I do have different Focus mode
36:31 - for with the different backgrounds for
36:33 - for work so when I'm working with the
36:35 - foundation I have actually uh I have
36:39 - actually these uh I don't know if I'm
36:41 - still sharing you are still sharing I
36:43 - switched you off for a second but you're
36:44 - back now nice um so yeah uh this these
36:48 - are backgrounds that are inspired by
36:51 - Design from DSi who made uh so Design
36:53 - Systems International who made the
36:55 - design for uh the latest processing
36:57 - website for the impact report the
36:59 - beautiful like all the beautiful design
37:01 - in the impact report that you showed
37:02 - before this is thanks to DSi so thanks
37:05 - to them and uh I took some of the thanks
37:09 - to their uh to run for letting me uh
37:12 - access those uh those visuals and I made
37:15 - some some adaptation of those for for
37:17 - desktop backgrounds as well so this is a
37:19 - little bonus extra that comes with the
37:22 - the wallpaper collection uh so if you
37:25 - want a a process wallpaper or P5
37:28 - wallpaper on your desktop on your phone
37:31 - you can you can have that there's even
37:32 - the the python processing one and uh uh
37:35 - processing for Android so yeah there
37:38 - there you go uh I have those as like my
37:41 - work focus and I have ronies as my
37:44 - streaming focus and yeah so yeah you can
37:47 - you can have as many as you

38:00 - here um so a couple things just to note
38:03 - thank you saber you're not following my
38:05 - instructions Sumer gifted some coding
38:08 - train memberships which is very kind of
38:10 - you uh but this is a processing
38:13 - Foundation fundraiser it's not a coding
38:15 - train uh uh uh is a coding but we're on
38:18 - the coding train but um so just so
38:20 - everybody knows uh if you if you just
38:22 - happen to jump in now um you want to
38:24 - find out more about the fundraiser
38:26 - everything that's on this page here um
38:28 - there is a pinned Link in the chat as
38:30 - well as a link in the video description
38:33 - um and um thank you to all of you who
38:35 - are watching and who are donating so
38:37 - we're gonna move to the bian milisha and
38:41 - Dan yeah so ra I guess Rafael has access
38:44 - to a live dashboard of donations so you
38:47 - should feel free I wish I wish we had
38:49 - gotten myself together to have some like
38:50 - you know Hearts like explode onto the
38:53 - screen when somebody donates but next
38:55 - year we'll do that next year uh but but
38:57 - but rapael can shout people out in their
39:00 - thanks um so uh uh since I one thing
39:04 - that I love to do on the coding train
39:06 - and it was reminded uh it's okay sabber
39:09 - I'm just I'm just teasing you um but uh
39:12 - uh one thing that was um REM that I was
39:16 - um uh reminded of when talking about the
39:20 - fellowship program and the community and
39:22 - all these beautiful wallpapers is how
39:25 - International um and and you know I I
39:28 - say this as a an obnoxious American
39:31 - basically like you're what is
39:33 - international really I mean we're all
39:35 - just part of this uh cohort of humans
39:37 - but anyway Global that's the word I
39:39 - should use this uh Global uh community
39:42 - and so one of the things I love to do on
39:43 - the coding train is here where everybody
39:45 - is from so Rafael and are going to start
39:48 - getting set up to do some live coding
39:50 - I'll also just briefly share since I
39:52 - have control of the screen here um I am
39:55 - currently an upstate New York and I
39:57 - while Raphael was sharing the wallpapers
39:59 - um I just grabbed a few photos off my
40:01 - phone this is what it looks like outside
40:03 - right now I took a picture of me in the
40:06 - same gles you know this is real took
40:07 - that just now not a fake fake snow
40:09 - that's the snow and this is uh I know
40:11 - coding train audiences might be familiar
40:12 - with my dog Gloria pickle this is what
40:14 - we had to do this morning to shovel a
40:16 - little area for her to go go outside and
40:18 - eat her food she has to eat outside um
40:21 - because the cats eat inside in the
40:23 - kitchen and if they're not separated
40:25 - Gloria will go and eat all the cat food
40:27 - so um that's why you be like why are you
40:29 - making your dog eat outside she likes it
40:31 - it's good trust me it works out for a
40:32 - family okay never
40:34 - mind okay so back so um so hopefully
40:38 - we're seeing in the chat um where folks
40:41 - are from we've got Minnesota if you've
40:43 - got any snow you can let us know how
40:44 - much snow you have I think there's I
40:46 - think there's got to be at least two
40:47 - feet out there right now it's it's
40:49 - remarkable a Gloria when I took her for
40:51 - a little walk she's like a short she's
40:53 - kind of like uh she's like a built like
40:55 - a tank but kind kind of short her whole
40:57 - body just descended into the snow was
40:59 - really amazing okay um it's snowing in
41:03 - Brooklyn but not nearly that much uh
41:05 - okay the coding SLE um all right so
41:09 - shall we move on to rapael is there
41:11 - anything else you wanted to say about
41:12 - the fundraiser or do we um anything else
41:15 - before we kind of move on and start see
41:16 - if we can get our coding setup
41:19 - going yeah no I think we're good I hope
41:22 - we mentioned everything if we didn't uh
41:24 - Kate sabber Sig feel free to feel free
41:27 - to let us know and um uh I see there's a
41:31 - message from Bianca in the chat that
41:32 - says donated but their address is wrong
41:35 - so yeah I would um I would just email
41:37 - the foundation I think it's probably
41:39 - there's probably like a hello at or info
41:41 - at somebody in the chat we'll let you
41:43 - know but you can send to uh uh uh yes
41:46 - Kate is already answering
41:47 - Foundation processing foundation.org
41:50 - okay um all right so Rafael are go and I
41:53 - are going to attempt to do something we
41:54 - haven't done at least I haven't done
41:56 - before and uh what you're seeing here
41:59 - now on screen is Visual Studio code if
42:03 - you followed any of my tutorials you're
42:05 - probably used to seeing either the
42:07 - processing IDE which is the Java
42:10 - platform or uh p5js in the form of the
42:13 - web editor which looks like this um it's
42:15 - what I like to use when I'm teaching and
42:17 - coding and sharing sketches but Visual
42:20 - Studio code which is a a text editor
42:23 - essentially for anything you could
42:24 - obviously you could use it for a lot of
42:26 - things Beyond just p5js but it has a
42:29 - certain feature in it two features that
42:32 - that I think are going to make this
42:33 - session kind of exciting one which is
42:35 - just live preview which is over here
42:38 - it's uh an extension I can show you how
42:40 - to install this so if you have Visual
42:42 - Studio code and there's a button here
42:44 - all the way over on the left if I click
42:46 - here under extensions and I were search
42:49 - for one like a live preview um you can
42:53 - see what this what this extension does I
42:55 - already have it installed is it runs it
42:58 - it it uh it hosts a little Local web
43:01 - server in your workspace what does that
43:04 - mean my workspace is a folder of these
43:06 - three files and it's running a web
43:09 - server which then opens up a little mini
43:12 - preview browser window it's right above
43:14 - Raphael over there which shows the P5
43:17 - sketch so this is that's just that's the
43:20 - less interesting piece that's the piece
43:22 - that's just like oh how would I create a
43:25 - P5 sketch and see the results of it in
43:28 - Visual Studio code the exciting piece
43:30 - the thing that's totally new to me as of
43:33 - today Raphael helped me set it up this
43:35 - morning is called live share uh and what
43:39 - live share does you can see here if uh
43:42 - Rafael you can just start typing
43:44 - whatever ra Raphael is invited to this
43:46 - workspace now in theory it is
43:48 - technically possible for me to invite
43:50 - all of you who are watching I'm not
43:52 - gonna do that right now don't get your
43:54 - don't get too excited I don't think I
43:56 - have the stomach for that I don't today
43:58 - but we'll see maybe at the end we we'll
44:00 - let that go you know I have a I have a
44:02 - like I could just like yank the plug the
44:04 - cord out from the wall if something goes
44:06 - horribly around but um I've sent rapael
44:09 - a private link I mean maybe there's some
44:11 - way some of you uh enterprising and
44:13 - resourceful viewers could figure out you
44:15 - know to hack your way into it I'm not
44:17 - suggesting you do that um but um so he's
44:20 - able to log in I additionally this is
44:22 - something that we learned today thank
44:24 - you to CJ from the coding Garden who was
44:27 - uh helping us with our setup this
44:29 - morning if you're not familiar with CJ
44:31 - he knows everything apparently um but
44:35 - you find him on Twitch um but he helped
44:38 - uh show me how we could set up a shared
44:40 - server so in addition to Raphael being
44:42 - able to see and live edit the code my
44:46 - server that is hosting the page here is
44:48 - actually also being shared with rapel so
44:50 - he can see in real time the results of
44:52 - the sketch so we're going to attempt to
44:54 - Live code and and make something
44:57 - together today with these
44:59 - tools so uh I guess before we go on
45:02 - Rafael did I miss anything important
45:04 - about this setup anything you want to
45:06 - talk about from your end that would be
45:07 - useful and if people have questions
45:09 - about how we're doing this setup uh
45:12 - beginner total beginner questions about
45:13 - like what is index on HTML anything is
45:17 - welcome here today as a
45:20 - question um yeah no I think I think you
45:23 - said you said it all uh the used live
45:26 - share before but I hadn't used the
45:28 - shared server thing and that's that's
45:30 - great that really makes it one thing is
45:32 - that uh you can't so you have a live
45:35 - preview set up inside of vs code and
45:38 - because um I'm in a virtual workspace on
45:41 - my end of things I don't get to do that
45:44 - uh the extension doesn't work so I have
45:46 - the preview up my setup looks pretty
45:49 - much like yours but I have the preview
45:52 - open in a separate browser window so I
45:54 - just arranged my windows uh the the
45:56 - advantage of having it in um in vs code
45:59 - directly is that you don't have to
46:02 - manage those windows there everything is
46:04 - in there and you can quickly tab between
46:06 - the two um and also uh if you're have
46:10 - some experience with web development and
46:11 - you want to use the dev tools you can do
46:13 - this from inside the inside vs code as
46:16 - well which is great you can have it at
46:17 - the bottom where the terminal would
46:19 - normally be uh yeah that's um that's
46:22 - also some little extras oh yeah so
46:25 - that's one thing I didn't consider so
46:26 - when I'm in the P5 web editor I will see
46:31 - console output here um you can't see
46:34 - this Raphael but I'm showing the P5 web
46:35 - editor right now um and then of course
46:38 - if I'm doing like sort of uh other kinds
46:41 - of web development things I'll just and
46:43 - say I'm using the Chrome browser or
46:44 - Firefox whatever I'm using I will go to
46:46 - view developer uh developer tools to see
46:49 - the console and other tools so if I'm
46:51 - here in Visual Studio code where can I
46:55 - see cons console output debug
46:58 - console that must be it uh so if I put
47:02 - in like console log Cho
47:07 - Chu oh I I still have by the way GitHub
47:10 - co-pilot is installed and active right
47:13 - now I think we can make the decision of
47:14 - whether I should turn that off or not I
47:16 - probably should uh but let's just see so
47:19 - I'm not no debug console doesn't seem to
47:22 - show that let's
47:24 - see where do I
47:27 - look um do you know do you know for live
47:30 - uh
47:33 - preview uh sorry I was trying to turn
47:36 - off GitHub copilot on my end but it says
47:39 - I have to reload and I don't want to
47:41 - reload because I would be disconnected
47:43 - from the live share so yeah here's a new
47:46 - thing I'll just pretend I don't have it
47:49 - um sorry you were asking I'm trying to
47:51 - figure out where I put a console log in
47:54 - setup and I'm trying to figure out where
47:56 - I would see the output of yeah so not
48:00 - there but if you go to your live preview
48:02 - all the way to the top right you have a
48:04 - little menu a hamburger menu yeah uh so
48:08 - if you click that you should be able to
48:09 - open Dev tools oh I don't see it I see
48:13 - the like little three dots oh no
48:16 - hamburger apparently I think I no no I
48:19 - understand now a hamburger is like a
48:22 - sandwich so it's the horizontal lines
48:24 - with slices something in between that's
48:27 - what this is okay yes open tool spade ah
48:30 - okay oh my goodness it's huge so let's
48:32 - see if I can uh and I oh this is just
48:35 - literally okay great so now I wonder if
48:38 - I can move this I don't mean to like
48:40 - obsessively waste our time you can move
48:42 - it so now in the dev tools you have a a
48:45 - three dot menu yes that you can move it
48:49 - around like you do in Chrome yeah yeah
48:51 - okay let's see oh but I don't this is oh
48:54 - okay wow so many things all right we're
48:56 - going to try it like this and we'll see
48:58 - how this goes um okay yeah
49:03 - oh uh all right so now I've got
49:06 - everything going I've got my file system
49:11 - index HTML sketch JS CSS file you know
49:14 - dare I say what's what's the probability
49:17 - likelihood of us writing any CSS today
49:19 - less than 1% unless I'm really allowed
49:21 - to use GitHub co-pilot it might increase
49:24 - uh and then here I've got the P5 code
49:27 - set up and draw the preview pane where
49:29 - you're seeing the red background and
49:31 - then over there all the way on the right
49:33 - is where if I were to uh let's just
49:36 - change the background color so it
49:38 - refreshes Dev tools failed to load wow
49:41 - look at this so I need to turn off the
49:45 - warnings um let's see if I can do that
49:47 - there's I know I've done this
49:49 - before uh uh verbose take off warnings
49:54 - take off info
49:56 - and there we go so I am now getting just
49:59 - the uh more sort of traditional uh error
50:03 - messages I'm just trying to like get the
50:05 - layout going here I'm gonna get this
50:07 - perfect everybody don't mind me ah okay
50:12 - uh unexpected token at sketch line
50:16 - where's my syntax
50:19 - error I don't see a syntax error what am
50:21 - I
50:22 - missing it's funny it's maybe that's
50:25 - just old oh yeah that's just old okay
50:28 - left over there we go okay now why how
50:31 - come I don't see console log Cho
50:35 - Chu there's only uh info aho oh because
50:40 - it's a live preview injected script okay
50:42 - I'm not going to worry too much about
50:44 - this right now we I'm G to uh close the
50:46 - dev tools and we can uh use them as
50:50 - needed
50:52 - okay I should put the console sha shank
50:54 - is suggesting in the chat that I put the
50:56 - console in a different window well I'll
50:58 - come back to it and figure that out as
50:59 - we go so we have to talk about what
51:01 - we're going to make oh maybe as a start
51:04 - SP all the time we spent all the time
51:06 - talking about the setup and figuring out
51:08 - how to do this we have no plan of what
51:10 - we actually want to build but we have a
51:12 - plan of how we want to go about it so
51:15 - yeah that might be the right time to
51:17 - introduce that right and I also had kind
51:19 - of like a starting point that could get
51:21 - us going here which is so you know
51:23 - coding train the symb of the coding
51:26 - train is the choo choo train if you will
51:30 - um as you saw uh from one of the
51:32 - wallpapers this like beautiful
51:34 - combination of the rubber duck bird BB
51:38 - like thing uh with the train wheels so
51:42 - um maybe maybe Rafael I know I know this
51:44 - is a processing Foundation stream we're
51:46 - doing here but since it's you and it's
51:47 - me I've got the train symbol maybe you
51:50 - could talk about where the bird or the
51:52 - BB if you will comes from um and May we
51:55 - that could be our starting point to make
51:58 - something yeah I I I just uh I just love
52:01 - drawing drawing BBS it's been my uh it's
52:04 - been my go-to uh kind of pattern thing
52:07 - to draw forever actually recently I was
52:11 - in uh I was in France for for the
52:13 - holidays and like helping my mom clear
52:16 - some some old papers and stuff from from
52:20 - shelves uh and uh one of those one of
52:24 - those was one of my ear BB drawing so I
52:26 - could I could show it but let me see
52:28 - where I posted it I think in my random
52:31 - in the random channel in my
52:33 - uh uh in my Discord or where was it uh
52:38 - no it was in the BS channel of course it
52:39 - is so if you can give me the scene the
52:43 - share the scene share let's see let me
52:45 - get that back to you there you go yeah
52:49 - so so yeah there that's that's my uh
52:51 - that's my oldest
52:54 - b b drawing but yeah it's kind of the
52:57 - theme uh the also like all the uh the
53:02 - emotes are BBS and uh and I'm not sure
53:06 - where to where to show people some of
53:08 - the some of the drawings it took me by
53:10 - surprise I I wasn't prepared to show my
53:13 - drawings but yeah the the ah I can't see
53:17 - the the cover there either uh yeah
53:22 - announcement uh yeah there you go that
53:24 - that's a good example that's uh so you
53:27 - go from the previous one to this that's
53:29 - my that's how they look
53:33 - now okay so yeah I basically I mean this
53:36 - is uh I think what's interesting about
53:39 - it is probably that you know at some
53:41 - point a few years ago I needed to feel I
53:44 - needed to reconnect with my creative
53:47 - self and I wanted to do this in a way
53:49 - that didn't involve computers um and I
53:52 - remembered this thing that gave me joy
53:54 - which was to just doodle BBS and so I
53:56 - started doing that and then it bring it
53:59 - got back into the computer but that's um
54:01 - uh that was a time I needed to have a
54:04 - creative Pursuit that was just me and a
54:06 - piece of paper and so so yeah that's uh
54:09 - that's it I I feel antire pages with
54:11 - tiny BBS uh if I if I'm bored and I need
54:15 - something to do with my
54:17 - hands amazing
54:21 - um um I don't know this might be too
54:24 - elaborate to to to start with but so I
54:27 - have this uh and I'm I'm switched back
54:30 - to my screen here I have this sketch
54:33 - this P5 sketch which just has some basic
54:35 - shapes on it which creates the uh little
54:38 - coding train image I don't know maybe we
54:40 - could somehow make a
54:42 - BB coding
54:44 - dream sketch or or but what we what we
54:49 - ultimately want to do is take
54:50 - suggestions from the audience so I don't
54:53 - know what uh what what what what strikes
54:55 - you as a of of a way of getting started
54:58 - here
55:01 - rapael yeah do I do I have a BB made out
55:04 - of code I'm not sure maybe we should
55:06 - make one maybe that's maybe that's what
55:08 - we can start with a chew a chew
55:12 - BB yeah a Cho chw BB yeah yeah no I'm
55:17 - I'm down for that uh we can I was going
55:20 - to say audio reactive but that might
55:22 - that's always complicated if you're
55:23 - trying to right for streaming
55:26 - yeah that's always the problem when you
55:27 - have a camera input or something but
55:29 - yeah so maybe not for now but yeah yeah
55:32 - yeah just animated verb so I'm gonna
55:35 - bring this in for a second or BBS on a
55:38 - train yeah that could also be a thing so
55:41 - and I'm goingon to take
55:43 - out uh oh this is kind of weird with the
55:46 - SC I was going to take out all of the
55:47 - lines and maybe we can make these
55:50 - circles into
55:54 - BBs
56:03 - well as is suggesting January speedrun
56:06 - but that's a little bit hard to just
56:08 - pull off off the cuff like
56:10 - that last time when I did the JY
56:13 - speedrun I I had a I had um a cooler
56:17 - with sandwiches and everything I had I
56:21 - prepared I I went shopping for groceries
56:23 - especially for the speed run was maybe a
56:26 - little of a kill but it did take six
56:29 - hours we don't have six hours
56:31 - Unfortunately today so but uh janary
56:35 - speedrun why not might be forthcoming
56:37 - maybe we do a maybe we do one where
56:40 - where we race each other to the Finish
56:43 - Line all right I've I don't know what
56:46 - I'm doing here but I I was starting with
56:49 - some of the shapes that were in the um
56:52 - coding train logo and making them into a
56:58 - BB I was GNA move these could be the
57:05 - eyes yeah Kate we did the we did the
57:08 - January speedrun last year I I started
57:10 - it and then Dan uh Dan beat my my uh my
57:14 - score my time by by about two hours
57:17 - which was very embarrassing well no I I
57:20 - I I might have had the uh shorter time
57:22 - score but you had the higher quality
57:24 - score for sure it's they're inversely
57:27 - proportional to each other it's it's
57:29 - very
57:36 - subjective ah Buras exhaust from the
57:39 - train yeah ah oh
57:43 - okay uh somebody says your audio is a
57:46 - little low is it low compared to me or
57:49 - is
57:51 - it just low because then that's you okay
57:54 - I will turn it up a little bit more um
57:58 - okay so
58:00 - um I like this idea of what of well I
58:04 - feel like what we need is something that
58:06 - I think what would be fun here is if
58:08 - we're each doing a different piece that
58:11 - they somehow are supposed to fit
58:13 - together
58:15 - so what if I I'm trying to decide like
58:17 - one idea could be you know one of us
58:20 - makes the train and the other one makes
58:22 - the burs maybe we in
58:25 - that I have to make the birds you make
58:27 - the train I don't know um or the other
58:31 - way
58:32 - around
58:41 - class Kathy you have to let Dave's
58:43 - messages go
58:45 - through I know I know they might look
58:47 - like spam but it's a whole
58:52 - thing Dave got hid in by our uh
58:55 - incredible moderating
58:57 - team
59:00 - okay okay you work on
59:02 - the I'm gonna go back and get my okay so
59:05 - I have I'm I'm gonna just look for
59:07 - something that I've been working on this
59:09 - is maybe this is cheating though if I
59:10 - bring in something that I've been
59:11 - working on
59:13 - already
59:15 - um because I have
59:21 - a yeah this is too elaborate what I'm
59:24 - working on and I can't even find it
59:25 - anyway okay I'm going to make the
59:27 - train you make the
59:30 - BB but I'm I'm going to get my this
59:33 - okay ah I have some nasty auto complete
59:39 - uh I keep doing the same thing hoping a
59:43 - different result this is H we know what
59:46 - this is
59:48 - [Music]
59:49 - so okay let's see
59:52 - here uh all right uh
59:55 - I got to get this train to show
60:00 - up oh I think if there's unfinished code
60:04 - okay I gotta there we
60:07 - go okay so what my attempt right now is
60:12 - to uh I'm gonna try to
60:16 - rescale I have a Json file I should have
60:18 - I should have done all this stuff in
60:19 - advance but I'm going to rescale this
60:22 - logo multiply everything by four uh
60:26 - because that's what it should look like
60:28 - um so I'm going to do this math math in
60:32 - my it's a terrible idea uh okay so let's
60:36 - see H stroke weight
60:41 - 12 oh this is uh and now um I am going
60:46 - to move these lines around uh times four
60:51 - okay let's make this a function I I I I
60:54 - I think I have an
60:57 - idea yeah we'll make a I I got it I got
61:00 - it everybody it's going to be
61:04 - fine oh no I lost the colors but yeah I
61:08 - got I'm making a train
61:12 - class
61:14 - uh go away GitHub
61:22 - co-pilot don't worry it's going to come
61:24 - back I'm going to put all of this code
61:27 - for drawing the
61:29 - train in
61:34 - uh in the train Class by the way I never
61:38 - it's interesting you called your
61:40 - function display I'm always calling my
61:42 - functions show or render now because
61:45 - like I think there's some JavaScript
61:46 - keyword somewhere that's display and I
61:49 - once ran into an issue um okay so now
61:53 - trying not to make it draw so it's not
61:55 - confusing with the existing draw Loop
61:57 - but yeah good to know uh class
62:01 - train uh train. show okay okay so now my
62:05 - train is visible but I would like to
62:09 - have a
62:12 - uh um I would like to have a a location
62:17 - for the
62:22 - train and
62:24 - somehow now translate to that
62:28 - location before I hit
62:33 - scale um so this is good so what if I
62:38 - were to make the train at 100 100 but I
62:43 - want it to be
62:45 - centered
62:48 - so oh no my changes don't get uh my
62:53 - changes get cancelled
62:55 - why I don't know I feel like there's
62:57 - some uh some versioning issues ah it's
63:00 - it keeps going back keeps rrolling back
63:04 - oh you know what might be happening I
63:05 - have this like in this like uh uh uh
63:10 - just this instinct to hit command s all
63:12 - the time and I wonder whenever I hit
63:14 - command s it might revert oh deom is
63:18 - saying they you've already done the math
63:20 - I did too I have a repo where I set up
63:23 - this whole elaborate thing with the math
63:25 - for the uh logo and a whole set of
63:28 - objects for each component of it I just
63:30 - was afraid to go grab that now but maybe
63:32 - you have something simpler that I could
63:35 - use um what is the width and height is
63:38 - what I want to know um so I'm going to
63:40 - make the size four for right now and so
63:43 - the scale is going to be this do size
63:46 - and then what I need to do is translate
63:48 - to the x minus I just have to guess what
63:51 - the like if I knew
63:54 - I mean that's not right but like what is
63:56 - the width and height of this
63:59 - natively without the
64:02 - scale um so like for example if I want
64:06 - to have it essentially at train dox
64:09 - equals Mouse X I'm gonna not hit save
64:12 - anymore I'm GNA just force myself not to
64:15 - hit save train. Y is mouse y so now I'm
64:19 - moving the train
64:21 - around but I want it to be centered
64:23 - around the mouse so how am I going to
64:26 - figure that
64:28 - out right now you can see that it's
64:31 - offset let's make the size of the
64:34 - train a one and we're going to get oops
64:38 - that's the BB uh we need the
64:42 - size so now how do I get the train to
64:46 - appear at the
64:49 - center
64:51 - of um to here at the center um of the
64:56 - mouse I just need to know the width and
64:58 - the height so what is the minimum
65:01 - X the minimum X looks like uh
65:07 - [Laughter]
65:14 - [Music]
65:23 - 22.51%
65:24 - there's nothing oh my God this is crazy
65:28 - let minimum y I think chat uh Co pilot
65:32 - is
65:34 - like uh wi equals Max x minus Minx it
65:40 - knows what I want to do uh how do I I
65:43 - really want to turn it off I feel like
65:44 - it's
65:46 - uh uh okay so then if I translate to
65:49 - this minus W / 2 minus h / 2
65:58 - uh that didn't work what did I miss I
66:00 - must not have the minimum X and Y
66:02 - correct oh yeah coordinates should be
66:05 - relative to the center of the
66:10 - train it was accidental Kathy's ban of
66:14 - uh Dave was accidental we're now finding
66:16 - out okay uh okay wait wait wait wa wait
66:19 - so I
66:20 - have the train is not what did I
66:24 - thanks to Fabio and Frank for the
66:30 - donations minus oh because oh it's this
66:33 - is actually the the points aren't even
66:35 - relative
66:37 - to oh this is so weird because the way
66:41 - this logo is drawn is to be Center in a
66:44 - like 100 by
66:45 - 100
66:48 - so click on the bottom right co-pilot
66:51 - icon then click disable co-pilot
66:55 - pilot Dave asked an interesting question
66:58 - do you find that you get sort of good at
67:00 - estimating distances in pixels uh I
67:02 - don't know about I I know exactly what
67:04 - you mean although I would not claim to
67:06 - be good any is this
67:08 - co-pilot uh co-pilot disable completions
67:13 - let's try that okay so I turned off
67:16 - co-pilot now I'm on my own people we're
67:19 - on our own co-pilot is off um okay wait
67:23 - I have to think about this I need to do
67:24 - I need some pencil and paper if my train
67:28 - I know the oh okay so if the train is
67:31 - here I need to know what is the ah I
67:34 - need to also offset it by got it it's
67:38 - actually
67:40 - weirdly oh it's really just going to be
67:42 - Max X and Max y I
67:46 - think yeah well it's not exactly right
67:48 - but close
67:51 - enough no I should be able to get it
67:53 - closer than that that uh what am I what
67:56 - am I missing here uh and I can't like
67:59 - Zoom back out so okay I'm using my pen
68:02 - and paper again people to figure this
68:04 - out I'm trying to get the train if I
68:07 - know first of all I don't I don't know
68:08 - if my width and height were actually my
68:10 - Min and Max were actually correct so
68:12 - this is the lowest that's the highest
68:15 - X and the lowest y oh but the highest Y
68:19 - and the lowest X would be so 7 6
68:25 - 78 not seeing a point that's
68:28 - bigger
68:31 - um so the first thing what is the top
68:35 - left U of the of the Train the top left
68:43 - is yeah it should be the minimum X and
68:45 - the minimum
68:48 - Y and
68:52 - so
68:56 - okay I have an idea minus Min y yes yes
69:01 - yes minus Max x ided two minus Max y
69:05 - divided two there we
69:08 - go got closer I really thought that was
69:11 - gonna do it right because oh no no no no
69:14 - yeah no no no I got it I got it I got it
69:16 - I got
69:19 - it uh I got it I got it everybody minus
69:22 - Min X I got it
69:26 - this is going to be it I got the math
69:28 - here everybody
69:30 - with there we look at that everybody my
69:33 - train is now centered
69:36 - yes that took me way too long to do okay
69:40 - but I have the train centered so now I
69:44 - can make a train of any size and I can
69:47 - start to move
69:49 - it
69:52 - across we're going to make it a train at
69:55 - zero a height divided by two and then I
69:59 - can say train dot should I give it like
70:03 - full steering Behavior no I think I'm
70:06 - just gonna right now say train dox
70:08 - equals train dox plus one okay rapael I
70:11 - finished my part are you done
70:14 - yet I'm
70:16 - joking I need to
70:18 - make I should make the wheels spin I
70:22 - should make the wheels spin that that
70:24 - would that but then you would need to
70:26 - change the design so we can actually
70:29 - notice yeah uh right also the way the
70:32 - circles are they're not drawn oh yeah
70:34 - okay okay let's change let's make the
70:36 - wheel let's add some spokes I'm gonna
70:39 - add some spokes to the
70:40 - wheels so
70:46 - uh
70:48 - um let the my B looks like an umbrella
70:51 - now it's not good is yeah okay so wait
70:56 - I'm thinking about
70:58 - this let's say I'm going to have an
71:01 - angle that starts at zero that goes up
71:06 - by um some amount let's do like you know
71:10 - pi divided by 8 or
71:12 - something and then I'm going to draw I'm
71:15 - gonna say push I'm going to say pop I'm
71:18 - going to translate for this circle to
71:22 - here
71:25 - uh and say
71:28 - push and pop here do I have my uh wheel
71:38 - back we have an error somewhere in our
71:40 - code
71:42 - but
71:44 - I I don't know if it's me or you this is
71:47 - one of the I lost my Dev console I
71:50 - should open it back up no mine works
71:55 - uh what do I have going on here push
71:58 - translate okay let me
72:00 - just comment this
72:04 - out all right let's see if we can find
72:07 - we got to find where something went
72:08 - wrong I'm gonna open up
72:10 - the
72:13 - oh something interesting happened I
72:16 - don't know
72:18 - why now my translate I think you missed
72:21 - a push pop somewhere because my verbs
72:24 - getting and
72:28 - translated oh I did I definitely did
72:31 - okay hold on makes it look nice though I
72:34 - got it back but I'm wondering why okay
72:36 - so I'm gonna move this Dev console to
72:40 - show to A A Different yeah let's open it
72:43 - up as a separate window and then I'm G
72:46 - to go back to uh
72:49 - default and if I hit refresh here I
72:53 - think I think I just got I think my live
72:55 - preview got
73:00 - stuck I'm afraid to disable my live
73:03 - preview or restart
73:05 - it okay hold on this might mess
73:08 - something up for
73:09 - you I'm gonna start and stop the server
73:13 - do you see things I don't see things
73:15 - anymore I I have to reload manually
73:18 - every time but it does work for me okay
73:20 - hold on I closed my live preview by
73:22 - accident okay
73:24 - okay uh live preview stop
73:29 - server start server Dave is saying like
73:33 - yeah at some point at some point Raph
73:35 - that's me asked if we could add an error
73:37 - if you have mismatched push and pop one
73:40 - the one of these days I should get
73:41 - around to adding that yeah that would be
73:43 - fantastic because that's a common source
73:45 - of Errors for for well I was going to
73:48 - say beginners but everyone is that if
73:51 - you use a lot of push and pop and you
73:53 - have no not as many pops as you have
73:55 - pushes then uh then your code might
73:58 - still run but you're going to have uh
74:02 - it's going to start growing growing
74:03 - growing growing and and eating up all
74:05 - the memory and getting very slow and you
74:07 - don't know why and it's actually Prett
74:09 - well I was going to say pretty easy I
74:11 - don't know how easy it is to implement
74:13 - Dave can tell us but uh but yeah the
74:16 - naive approach would be just to say like
74:18 - how many pushes are in the code and how
74:20 - many pops and if it doesn't match then
74:22 - you have a problem
74:25 - oh that's the small circle
74:28 - okay can you still still hear me Dan I
74:30 - don't know yes I can still hear sorry I
74:32 - was lost in my own world of making
74:34 - spokes for the wheels nice yeah yeah no
74:38 - I I can feel the blanks that's I'm
74:39 - totally fine with that just wanted to
74:41 - make sure yes yes thanks and thanks Eric
74:45 - for the
74:49 - donation can't wait to see wings and
74:52 - bird head added to the train well I'm
74:54 - making the head it's it's taking a while
74:57 - but but I'm making the
75:03 - head
75:04 - line so I'm going to do this do
75:08 - s um oh yeah you can't see what I'm
75:10 - doing though but that's
75:15 - fine so so I have my BB is like one Arc
75:20 - and then two lines on the sides which
75:21 - took way more like way too much time for
75:24 - such a simple shape but
75:27 - yeah I'm going to add a
75:30 - beak could have some more BBS coming out
75:32 - of train chimney I lost the I lost
75:35 - things again I don't know why this
75:39 - happens let's see is there an
75:41 - error developer
75:45 - tools ah oh uh line 38 there's an error
75:49 - in line
75:51 - 38 ah oh it's just you type we're good
75:53 - we're good oh is it oh yeah 30 uh I'm on
75:57 - fine it's just this is the confusing
75:59 - thing about coding together uh okay so
76:02 - I'm just gonna keep going yeah yeah it's
76:03 - back it's back okay and I need to do the
76:06 - bigger circle is actually the one that I
76:08 - want to
76:10 - do and I'm G to be doing some things
76:13 - that might mess you up but I'm going to
76:15 - get them
76:22 - back
76:34 - okay where
76:38 - is okay ah I have a spoke and the spoke
76:42 - has to go
76:47 - to uh okay now there we go okay have a
76:51 - Spoke everybody
76:53 - now what I need to do
76:57 - is uh
76:59 - rotate
77:01 - by uh pi divided by
77:06 - 8
77:13 - and oh the pop is here um oh that's
77:16 - because I oh I see rotate by a okay it's
77:19 - fine there we go okay I made my spokes
77:26 - oh franchello says Wheels have to spin
77:28 - at different rates because they have
77:29 - different sizes yes oh though don't
77:31 - worry that's gonna
77:33 - happen wait what did I do wrong here
77:36 - okay uh so now I need them to also be
77:39 - offset by the speed okay so we need the
77:42 - train needs to have a
77:45 - speed uh this doped we're just going to
77:48 - set it to one we're going to have an
77:50 - update
77:51 - function we're going to say this .x plus
77:53 - equals this.p speed I'm going to get rid
77:56 - of that in
77:58 - draw by the way nobody I realize that
78:00 - people don't really seeing what you're
78:02 - typing um because because they're seeing
78:05 - where I am but that's
78:07 - fine yeah that's okay I was I was gonna
78:10 - say I saw also an interesting point uh
78:12 - question in the chat um Matos is asking
78:15 - why so many Magic numbers can I has
78:18 - hasard a
78:19 - guess which uh I'm assuming that this
78:23 - was drawn in some software like inkscape
78:25 - or illustrator and exported as
78:28 - as and so I I what I really should if I
78:31 - had thought about any of this in advance
78:33 - I've been working on a basically like a
78:36 - Json file that has all of the details of
78:41 - the design and then I have this uh class
78:45 - which loads it all into individual
78:46 - components and resizes all the geometry
78:49 - so I really should be using that because
78:53 - I but
78:54 - um such is life okay so now what I don't
78:58 - understand is why oh not this not this.
79:00 - speed okay we need a oh the wheel needs
79:04 - its own I guess I could do
79:09 - like uh all right we're going to do an a
79:12 - I'm going to give the train an angle
79:14 - this is a little so like wheel angle
79:16 - I'll just call it angle because maybe I
79:18 - don't need other angles is zero and so
79:21 - in update
79:25 - uh the angle is also going to change by
79:28 - the speed but maybe since this one
79:31 - radian is a lot let's do the speed
79:35 - divided by like 10 just for now and then
79:38 - that angle that I'm
79:40 - rotating can be the
79:42 - offset
79:45 - okay why did that break everything this
79:49 - do angle this do angle equals
79:51 - zero
79:54 - that should
79:58 - work have to wait till Ro my finishes
80:01 - typing for S to come
80:03 - back it should be fine I'm trying to
80:06 - match your uh the stroke weight but for
80:09 - some reason doesn't not sure what I've
80:12 - done you're scaling by four and using a
80:17 - 2.9 we've really like uh I I really
80:20 - messed things up by starting with this
80:22 - train right I should have just made
80:23 - something much simpler I should maybe we
80:25 - should maybe I should start over I
80:26 - should just make a rectangle with two
80:29 - wheels this elaborate
80:32 - design well I have very elaborate very
80:36 - elaborate BB as well as you can
80:38 - tell ah okay ah there's my spokes again
80:42 - okay so my spokes are there now why is
80:47 - my offset not working was I doing it
80:50 - with the wrong okay hold on let me get
80:52 - rid of of the spokes for the
80:55 - other for the other circles so I'm not
80:59 - confused
81:05 - okay so why does it not work to say.
81:08 - this.
81:11 - angle why is
81:14 - that that should just be a nice offset
81:16 - of everything oh there we go I think
81:18 - it's just because we're coding the there
81:19 - we go yes the wheel is spinning now
81:23 - actually like that oh yeah that's quite
81:26 - nice
81:31 - um thank you Kate for
81:34 - joining um okay so now do I dare add
81:38 - spokes to the other Wheels I don't see
81:41 - why
81:44 - not I mean it's just the copy pasting my
81:47 - code that's the way you're supposed to
81:49 - do this kind of stuff right you just
81:51 - copy paste your code all over the place
81:53 - that's good that's good right okay oh so
81:56 - now uh this has to be four
82:01 - 516 okay and stroke weight gonna have a
82:05 - I'm gonna have my bur blinking with the
82:07 - good old uh frame count modulo in
82:12 - inferior to one trick yeah so I'm doing
82:15 - it twice at twice the
82:21 - speed
82:23 - that's going to work um where is the
82:26 - other
82:28 - wheel wheel one wheel two wheel
82:34 - three I know random
82:38 - random oh noise all my wheels are
82:42 - turning now so what I was thinking of
82:46 - doing was having the BBS come out of
82:51 - the
82:53 - Smoke Stack if you will of the train may
82:56 - we need to make maybe I need to make a
82:57 - scene for the
82:59 - train because right now and and we
83:02 - should give ourselves a little more
83:03 - space I'm G to make the canvas 600 by
83:07 - 400 and I need to see like I'm gonna
83:10 - make it black just for a second okay um
83:14 - 51 used to be the color of choice for
83:16 - the coding
83:17 - tray
83:19 - nice know why okay so now let's make a
83:25 - um oh oh no okay oh the train is
83:31 - now Center so what if I I think I should
83:34 - just estimate
83:36 - it um let's just do a I really just want
83:40 - to like have it like drive over a
83:43 - curve so okay so here are some ideas uh
83:47 - I
83:48 - could well first I need to have the
83:51 - train uh let's have the I think the
83:53 - train is going a little bit too slow
83:55 - frankly so let's have the train go
83:58 - where's its speed Set uh twice as fast
84:02 - that's
84:08 - better and then if it gets
84:16 - to I really need a width and height of
84:19 - the
84:20 - train but I'm just going to do this
84:23 - just like set it off the screen
84:27 - okay uh oh it could I could have it snow
84:34 - but the train let's make sure the train
84:36 - comes
84:38 - back okay okay so the train is going I
84:41 - feel like I either want to have it I
84:44 - think I kind of want to have it drive
84:45 - along a curve but that's kind of nuts I
84:48 - guess I could make a sine wave all right
84:50 - I'm going to try this this is this is a
84:52 - terrible idea but I'm going to do it
84:54 - anyway or I'll do pearlin Noise Okay I'm
84:57 - going to make a little mountainous but a
84:59 - train goes on his flat train doesn't
85:01 - really go up and
85:03 - down there yeah there are some like how
85:05 - are they called uh oh speed divided by
85:08 - the radius of the wheel that is
85:12 - smart okay I think it'll be interesting
85:15 - to see you have this you have this uh
85:18 - elevator train that goes uh it only goes
85:22 - in one straight line I'm I'm curious
85:25 - about this so I'm GNA do I'm GNA make a
85:28 - variable called
85:30 - terrain and uh terrain is going to
85:42 - be is going to be have a a y value
85:47 - that's based on
85:51 - noise and
85:52 - [Music]
85:57 - then I'm going to try to draw this
86:09 - terrain just do
86:14 - this a little bit more space
86:17 - [Music]
86:20 - here I'm St standing in front of the
86:23 - code I can make myself smaller okay and
86:26 - then
86:27 - um we're going to say vertex okay so
86:31 - x equals i y equals we're going to take
86:37 - the the noise
86:39 - value and map it I mean I'm just going
86:42 - to multiply it by height since the noise
86:43 - is between zero and one so vertex X
86:47 - comma
86:48 - y uh no
86:51 - fill can I get it
86:55 - back I've got to wait
87:04 - now I'm waiting for the code
87:07 - to re-engage let's see is there an error
87:10 - somewhere line 26 oh it's
87:14 - me no that I don't know but there was uh
87:18 - I don't know there was some kind of Auto
87:21 - oh did I hit save again
87:23 - if I hit save it reformats the
87:26 - code yeah yeah there's some prettier
87:28 - stuff happening I'm not sure if it but
87:31 - it should break anything I don't know
87:34 - I've been afraid to hit
87:36 - save but I want it save
87:40 - now I lost a part of the burb for some
87:44 - reason that's my I think anytime I hit
87:46 - save it somehow seems to overwrite
87:49 - things that you're
87:51 - doing and I'm gonna have to restart the
87:53 - server again I
87:55 - think I'm not sure it's it looks like it
87:58 - should be there but it's not appearing
88:01 - okay I got my terrain back okay my
88:04 - terrain is there awesome okay so now I'm
88:09 - going to have the okay so first thing I
88:12 - need to do is I don't need a single I
88:16 - don't want like a x value for every
88:21 - um for every pixel so I'm just going to
88:24 - have a a like a step size is
88:28 - five
88:30 - uh okay and then uh then xals I times
88:37 - step and then I want the I'm going to do
88:41 - map because I would like the terrain to
88:44 - go just between like height divided by
88:47 - two and
88:49 - height okay so there's my Terrain
88:55 - now I need the Train's y
89:00 - position to look up to get its y
89:04 - position uh okay so uh let the index
89:09 - equal the Train's Exposition divided by
89:12 - the step size and I need to floor
89:17 - that and it's y position
89:22 - should be the terrain uh
89:26 - index oh this
89:32 - doy uh how come that didn't
89:37 - work this
89:43 - dox what did I do wrong here bicular
89:47 - that's true JL the terrain is
89:57 - is
90:00 - uh am I
90:02 - not oh because of the this stuff no that
90:06 - shouldn't
90:07 - matter because it's the Y okay hold on
90:10 - uh let's just say mouse y for a
90:15 - second uh
90:19 - oh okay so that work
90:25 - works the train is
90:39 - no why is the train no longer at the
90:45 - center what did I
90:50 - change
91:08 - I have to look at the developer tools
91:10 - I'm so not used to working like this
91:12 - okay so this makes
91:16 - sense it's looking into the
91:20 - array okay and
91:22 - then it
91:27 - is uh let's look at the terrain the
91:31 - terrain array should have oh the terrain
91:35 - array doesn't have the mapping in it oh
91:37 - what a I'm so silly I'm so silly no
91:42 - wonder that's so obvious let's do the
91:45 - mapping
91:47 - here
91:50 - uh
91:55 - and that way uh
91:58 - Y and
92:00 - now
92:03 - here should have okay so we're mapping
92:06 - the
92:08 - noise of I divided by 100 okay great so
92:12 - now my train is following the
92:15 - terrain
92:17 - but it's
92:20 - off it's like not properly centered I
92:23 - think I'm just going to like fake
92:27 - this I'm G to I know I'm going to rotate
92:30 - it
92:32 - next oh um but why is it not it should
92:37 - be centered right around what did I do
92:39 - that broke the centering of the
92:43 - tree do you have a translate in there
92:46 - that's not pushed and
92:48 - popped Poss I'm wondering because I'm
92:51 - not am I using translate I'm push I'm
92:55 - gonna comment out your bb just for a
92:57 - second yeah just go
93:01 - ahead except now I have nothing
93:04 - again okay okay so you no it doesn't
93:06 - seem like your bb is I don't think so
93:09 - yeah
93:11 - okay so
93:14 - what just curious again to set the
93:17 - XY to the mouse
93:20 - X
93:24 - and Y again okay yeah I lost whatever I
93:27 - had done previously that had the train
93:30 - perfectly
93:32 - centered um and I really
93:35 - should these should
93:37 - [Music]
93:40 - be Global variables oh wait a second I
93:44 - think I know the issue I know the issue
93:48 - I am doing that trans no I'm doing that
93:50 - translation
93:52 - um before I do the
93:55 - scale okay so I think this happens okay
94:00 - I think boy this is really insane what
94:03 - I'm doing uh oh I can't
94:06 - undo oh no what well I think I might
94:08 - have undone something you did because I
94:10 - was trying to do undo what I did but I
94:12 - think it there like multiple typing
94:13 - things going on so undo does not work
94:16 - the way that it normally works but it's
94:18 - fine I can get it and I typ and I typed
94:21 - uh this do s divided by zero so you know
94:23 - we're all struggling
94:26 - here okay okay so I just need to get it
94:32 - back I have an error here okay uh line
94:38 - sketch line 60 there's something wrong
94:40 - on line 60 ah you have got an extra
94:41 - slash here I'm fixing
94:43 - it okay line 60 I fixed I fixed that
94:47 - error okay we're back I don't see
94:49 - anything on the screen but I've got the
94:51 - background again okay um is not what I
94:58 - just want to see the train
95:00 - again uh Min X is not oh this is my
95:03 - fault uh where is oh right right right
95:07 - right oh no I lost my is it still in my
95:10 - oh no I lost my
95:13 - V somehow we I lost all of that okay
95:16 - it's okay
95:18 - everybody we're gonna have to get this
95:20 - back I I don't know this uh live share
95:22 - is meant for people to actually write
95:25 - code in the same file at the same time
95:27 - no it's definitely not we're definitely
95:29 - not doing we're definitely not doing
95:31 - what it's meant
95:33 - for but I have mys right where you ask
95:37 - question at people code but yeah I'm I'm
95:39 - I might have to turn co-pilot back on
95:41 - okay wait no so I can I can get these
95:43 - numbers again I'm gonna do this all in
95:46 - the train Constructor this. Minx I'm
95:49 - gonna I'm going to give a shout out to
95:52 - Kieran for for the donation Max X
95:55 - donations are still coming in I need a
95:58 - Max X which I think was
96:05 - 78 I need a doing in a standalone file
96:09 - that might not be a bad idea since we
96:12 - can't show it on the screen anyway I
96:13 - know I was thinking like oh I can't
96:15 - break things down to separate files but
96:17 - obviously that would have really
96:18 - helped I could still do it
96:23 - um uh that now I'm looking for the Min y
96:29 - 44
96:31 - 44 for the lines uh
96:40 - 27 stman
96:44 - y the stop Max y where's my highest uh
96:49 - 66 is right now
96:53 - highest 67 this circle is higher but 68
96:59 - 67 oh there's these
97:03 - lines uh oh no this is what I'm looking
97:05 - for 50 the last in the lines it's the
97:08 - last
97:09 - value give me something super high
97:13 - okay let's try this
97:17 - 59 I guess I'm gonna have to do this 67
97:21 - yeah this is fine this is not perfectly
97:23 - accurate but it'll get me
97:26 - somewhere okay the train is back
97:30 - now I think I know what to do translate
97:33 - then do the scale then translate by
97:36 - negative this okay so let me just get
97:39 - the the
97:40 - width the Train's
97:43 - width Max x minus Min
97:49 - x uh and the Train's height this is
97:53 - ridiculous what I'm
97:59 - doing uh and
98:01 - then I am going
98:04 - to uh after scale translate by negative
98:10 - this.width not too exponential gez
98:13 - negative this.
98:15 - height so that's getting me closer but
98:18 - that's fine that's not this actually
98:20 - goes by two two and then I'm also going
98:23 - to translate by negative this. Minx
98:27 - negative this. Min
98:29 - y okay I'm back to drawing the train at
98:32 - the center everybody now what I want
98:34 - though is for the Y to
98:38 - [Music]
98:41 - be um I should really work on my train
98:44 - in a separate file too should I go and
98:46 - do that I'm going to do
98:49 - that yeah I moved my BB code to uh the
98:53 - TR is going into a separate file it's
98:56 - going to break things for a minute here
98:58 - train.
98:59 - JS okay and then
99:05 - index.html now just a quick time check
99:07 - we said we were going to stream for two
99:10 - hours I don't have a hard out but we
99:13 - should work toward the goal that we're
99:15 - gonna finish up at some point soon uh
99:18 - yeah what's a realistic goal now yeah
99:21 - uh okay hold on let's get the code back
99:23 - to working
99:25 - again okay so the
99:27 - train I can now be in a separate
99:31 - file do we have an error going on pallet
99:36 - is not defin at bb.
99:39 - show I think you lost we lost like the
99:43 - pallet oh oh yeah no we did I was copy
99:46 - pasting it right now oh uh ah yeah no I
99:49 - need to yeah because if I was putting it
99:53 - outside of the well it still should work
99:55 - as a global variable outside true and
99:59 - that def what you did now definitely
100:01 - won't work unless you do
100:03 - this this dot pallet uh and this the
100:08 - pallette Instead This is actually fun
100:10 - now I this is actually what I should
100:11 - have been doing all along I'm just
100:12 - watching you code and I could just a
100:15 - backseat Drive no no no you made a
100:17 - mistake fix that you did it wrong uh
100:22 - yeah and oh it still broke pallet is not
100:25 - defined where do I do I still use pallet
100:28 - uh this do palette palette
100:32 - palette
100:34 - palette uh what or does it where is it
100:38 - BJs
100:41 - 15 no there's things I don't trust about
100:44 - this weird process of live preview and
100:47 - live
100:49 - share yeah it's it can be a bit Jank but
100:53 - but now it's good uh now it's now it's
100:56 - running and Dave was suggesting some
100:59 - weird some weird blinking uh mechanic
101:02 - that I don't fully understand two sine
101:05 - waves with a slight offset in their
101:07 - wavelength so it blinks when either
101:09 - reaches zero is and they drift in and
101:13 - out of phase I got I I I I feel like I
101:16 - understood it up to the point where
101:18 - where they drift in and out of face
101:22 - oh oh wait okay so two sine waves that
101:26 - are slightly off and when either of them
101:29 - reaches
101:31 - zero okay It's Tricky making
101:34 - ice blink is uh is is harder than you'd
101:38 - think at least to make it look re sort
101:41 - of realistic but still
101:49 - organic
101:53 - my live preview is like I'm having to
101:55 - refresh okay I've got the train
101:57 - following the terrain perfectly so I
102:00 - just for it to actually live on the
102:02 - terrain I need
102:05 - to
102:07 - um I need to uh change the
102:11 - translation to have it be drawn relative
102:15 - to the
102:19 - bottom
102:23 - okay no that that's relative to the
102:25 - top oh yeah so just take out the divide
102:28 - by
102:29 - two yeah my live preview is no longer
102:32 - working okay my train is following the
102:35 - terrain look at that look how beautiful
102:37 - that is now I'm going to rotate it I
102:39 - think I should make it a little bit
102:41 - smaller it's too big relative to the
102:44 - terrain uh we can we can put the BB now
102:48 - uh we can try to attach the BB to the
102:50 - train oh my
102:53 - God okay so sorry I something has
102:56 - happened here which I heard a very loud
102:58 - noise like a earthquake kind of noise
103:01 - I'm in a garage and on top of this
103:04 - garage on the roof of the garage is
103:06 - approximately two to three feet of snow
103:09 - and it just started falling off so I'm
103:11 - like looking out of a window over there
103:12 - and I see this huge literally an
103:14 - avalanche of snow falling off the roof
103:16 - of the garage I I you snowed into the
103:19 - garage now are you going to be able to
103:21 - get out no I could get out the I I'm
103:23 - pretty sure the door will be clear on
103:26 - the other side if snow doesn't doesn't
103:28 - slide off on the other side yeah well I
103:31 - guess I'm here streaming all day okay
103:34 - wait I need to rotate the
103:39 - train uh let me go to sketch here change
103:42 - the size of the train to
103:46 - smaller is that the size or is that the
103:48 - speed yes okay so so I have a little
103:51 - small train no I just need to get my
103:52 - train to rotate while it follows the
103:54 - terrain then we can start putting the
103:57 - BBS or whatever we want to do coming out
103:59 - of the
104:02 - train I feel like the colors maybe it
104:05 - was better with white I don't know oh
104:09 - okay hold on I'll just leave it as black
104:11 - for right now that's what we're doing
104:13 - okay so now what I need to do the last
104:16 - thing I need to do
104:18 - is in the Train's C Cod I'm getting the
104:24 - index so I need to get index minus one
104:27 - and + one this is crazy what I'm doing
104:30 - but I'm going to do it anyway I need to
104:32 - get oh so angle should be the wheel
104:34 - angle so this is actually just the wheel
104:38 - angle because I'm G to have a different
104:40 - angle
104:42 - now
104:44 - and where are wheel
104:49 - angle we real angle
104:53 - okay so now what I need to do is I need
104:56 - to get the point from before and after
104:59 - the
105:00 - train
105:02 - so uh this.x divided by step I'll just
105:06 - do the one I'm just going to do the one
105:09 - after a next index
105:15 - equals uh I just oh actually I can just
105:18 - do index plus one what am I even doing
105:20 - so so I'm going to make a
105:22 - vector okay so I'm going to get uh next
105:27 - y equals terrain index + one that's the
105:32 - next y then I need to make a vector I
105:35 - need to get the angle so the vector is
105:38 - going to
105:39 - be uh I'm going to make a
105:44 - vector which
105:46 - is uh DX equals
105:51 - the uh next uh this.x plus
105:55 - step Dy
105:58 - is uh oh no that's
106:01 - next it's actually DX is just the step
106:03 - size it's always the step size Dy is
106:07 - next next y minus this doy and then I
106:11 - need to create a vector out of those
106:13 - components and this dot angle should be
106:17 - that vector's heading so now I need a
106:20 - this dot angle
106:22 - property and then when I right before I
106:25 - draw the train I should be able to say
106:28 - whoops I should be able to say rotate by
106:31 - this dot angle this is my last little
106:34 - piece didn't
106:36 - work but I'm not convinced sometimes oh
106:40 - yes it's working I mean it's not doing
106:42 - it
106:46 - correctly look at the TR following the
106:50 - terrain what's going on so I think it
106:52 - might so first let's just try like do I
106:55 - do I have an off by one a directionality
106:59 - error no
107:02 - can't it looks like the rotate translate
107:06 - order isn't right for that yeah pretty
107:10 - sure
107:11 - that because I'm drawing it relative to
107:13 - the okay hold on let's
107:16 - try right because this was the center oh
107:21 - oh because I'm I want it to rotate from
107:23 - the center but then I need to shift it
107:25 - oh this is so ridiculous okay I got an
107:29 - idea yeah let me just do this first okay
107:32 - so now at least it's rotating the
107:34 - correct angle ah there we go look at it
107:37 - following that
107:38 - terrain amazing okay but uh I need to
107:43 - shift it after I rotate
107:45 - it by a little more of the height
107:56 - right yeah it should be more it's it's
107:58 - not going to be
108:01 - perfect but you can see like uh and I
108:04 - think what I should do is actually lurp
108:06 - the
108:07 - angle uh equals lurp this do angle V do
108:13 - heading because it's kind of
108:14 - anticipating the angle by like uh 0.01
108:18 - let's just see what that does
108:25 - oh sorry I'm
108:27 - uh I broke the
108:30 - code okay wait uh look no I broke the
108:36 - code we both broke the
108:44 - code my train is really trying to follow
108:47 - that terrain but something about it is
108:50 - like kind of
108:52 - off but you know kind of good
108:59 - enough I should just make it more
109:01 - abstract yeah why is it
109:03 - so okay so let's make the terrain less
109:07 - extreme I think that's I think this will
109:09 - be this will make
109:11 - things like feel nicer I think I need to
109:15 - make my font size a little smaller
109:17 - hopefully that's not going
109:19 - to
109:20 - uh mess things up too much for people uh
109:23 - to be able to see okay I need to where
109:26 - do I set the terrain values oh that's in
109:29 - that's in sketch. JS I need to hit save
109:31 - in sketch. JS hopefully that's not going
109:33 - to mess you up okay
109:36 - uh okay so my
109:40 - terrain yeah if my terrain is like less
109:42 - weird okay so this is good so why I
109:46 - think I'm
109:48 - just whoa it really doesn't I think the
109:51 - rotation like relative rotation is
109:57 - off but it looks pretty good still okay
110:09 - um oh longer terrain steps what if I
110:11 - make shorter terrain
110:14 - steps uh oh I broke
110:18 - something longer Terin
110:23 - steps yeah I like this okay now I think
110:26 - if I draw the terrain in a more abstract
110:29 - way it'll also
110:34 - um and what I need to do
110:37 - is uh
110:41 - vertex okay I need to
110:45 - do vertex width comma
110:49 - height and then oh and the terrain needs
110:52 - to
110:53 - be let do greater than or equal to and
110:57 - then
110:59 - uh
111:01 - vertex zero comma height okay so then
111:05 - let's
111:07 - do no
111:09 - [Music]
111:11 - stroke and uh
111:16 - let's draw the train
111:18 - after
111:20 - and I was going to try to make it
111:23 - fuzzier yeah see it kind of just looks
111:25 - like it's going
111:27 - over oh I have an
111:31 - idea Ellis I don't know actually I don't
111:34 - know
111:35 - it well then I can thank uh Carlos and
111:39 - David for their
111:42 - donations thanks you two okay I think I
111:45 - can be done with my
111:46 - dream we can start to connect these
111:49 - pieces
111:52 - uh yeah because the bird is so good
111:54 - right now I don't know what happened I
111:57 - I'm trying so I'm trying to do something
111:59 - I'm trying to get the neck to to get the
112:02 - BB to have like uh a neck that that
112:06 - elongates so I've organized my code a
112:08 - little better but it's still doing
112:10 - something weird with I'm not sure where
112:13 - uh maybe you can help me find it out but
112:17 - so yeah in the BB JS if look into there
112:21 - I'm I'm trying I was trying to just
112:25 - translate the neck uh sorry the the the
112:28 - top The Arc the top of the B oh oh wait
112:32 - this is bet well this is almost better
112:34 - you have it here
112:36 - too oh yeah okay so I was doing it
112:40 - twice
112:42 - uh what's going on uh I like how it's
112:48 - like
112:51 - how about just making the second point
112:52 - for the angle calculate further down the
112:55 - length that's not a bad
112:58 - idea um the idea was that it would the
113:02 - bottom would stay the same place but
113:05 - then the whole thing would get
113:08 - longer uh I'm not sure why it's still
113:11 - like still getting translated down I I
113:15 - feel like I oh let's see now it's good
113:20 - oh and then put this back that doing
113:23 - nothing I'm afraid to hit save but I'm
113:26 - I'm having weird refresh caching issues
113:29 - like where I'm not really clear on when
113:32 - the code is being
113:33 - updated yeah if I press save here then
113:37 - is it gonna yeah I have to press save
113:39 - okay so I needed to save locally
113:42 - otherwise it didn't didn't do anything
113:44 - uh now the train is it's little its head
113:48 - is oscillating up and down only not the
113:50 - Train the verb okay yeah and then I'm
113:53 - gonna do the same thing for the eye and
113:56 - the beak okay so if you work on the BB
114:02 - design and I go to sketch. JS maybe I
114:06 - can make an array of BBS oh but the BB
114:10 - needs an X and A Y uh argument yeah it
114:13 - needs an X and A Y and the rest is uh
114:17 - and a size oh I see it just has it has
114:19 - defaults you you have this fancy coding
114:22 - thing where you give it defaults if you
114:23 - don't give it an argument okay so what I
114:25 - was going to try to do is make BS come
114:27 - out of the
114:28 - train yes okays so I'll work on that so
114:32 - I'm gonna make an array of
114:35 - BBS and uh what we're going to do is g
114:38 - to say let BB of
114:43 - BBS whatever BBS there are BB
114:47 - doow and uh for the BB I give it a an X
114:51 - and A Y and a
114:53 - size okay so what I want to do is let me
114:57 - just get the Y value from the
115:00 - train and the x value from the TR well I
115:03 - guess okay let's just do
115:04 - this uh verbs. push a new BB at train
115:11 - dox train doy let's see what happens
115:17 - there Moment of Truth
115:20 - I broke
115:23 - something I have your B.S as not saved
115:26 - which is but I don't think that's okay
115:28 - let's look at where the developer tools
115:31 - are cannot read properties of undefined
115:33 - push sketchs line 26 I'm reading push
115:37 - sketch
115:38 - 26 did I not make oh uh I forgot to make
115:42 - BBS and array there we go this is my my
115:45 - small little
115:48 - mistake okay okay I'm making way too
115:51 - many BBS so this is good though so I'm
115:54 - going to say if uh random
115:57 - one uh one is less than 0.1 so I'm only
116:00 - going to make a BB randomly every so
116:02 - often and then I need to make them much
116:06 - smaller okay so there I'm making the BBS
116:09 - I don't think yourh stroke weight is
116:10 - tied to the side yeah I was gonna I was
116:13 - gon to say that I need to I was to match
116:16 - your existing strokes but I can do
116:18 - it Min us train.
116:22 - height so the verbs are now coming out
116:24 - of the top of the train oh amazing okay
116:27 - so now I need to just have the BBS uh
116:30 - move and fade away so is it okay if I
116:34 - give your BBS a a velocity
116:38 - variable this is dangerous because I'm
116:41 - gonna start messing with your bb
116:44 - class uh yeah no that's fine I'll I'll
116:47 - I'll try oh I was trying to to make this
116:51 - well maybe you you touch the stroke
116:52 - weight as well I I'll let you I'll let
116:55 - you I'll follow you oh I didn't touch
116:57 - the stroke weight no but you can I tried
117:01 - do it okay I I made it dependent on the
117:04 - size but it doesn't look like it's
117:05 - really the right scale uh so hold on
117:10 - what did you have it originally at oh oh
117:15 - that's weird wait so now I see I'm
117:17 - following you and I see you in a bb. JS
117:20 - file that has a capital B but mine
117:23 - doesn't mine has a lowercase b oh so so
117:28 - I'm a bit confused how did you get to a
117:30 - BJs file with a capital B maybe you have
117:34 - uh do you have maybe like some
117:37 - automation that makes C Class files
117:40 - capitalized no mine shows as
117:43 - lowercase oops oh okay uh yeah I don't
117:48 - have an uppercase I mean that the name
117:50 - of the class is uppercase but okay yeah
117:54 - well uh yeah then I I'll just
117:58 - uh I'll just take the back seat and see
118:01 - and and watch you code for a second oh
118:04 - okay but wait all right let's get this
118:06 - so what did you have the stroke weight
118:07 - at
118:08 - before uh it was 2.9 because that's what
118:11 - I I copy pasted that from your side but
118:14 - it never matched for some reason that's
118:17 - fine and same for the scale so the size
118:20 - oh I see so what I the the the goofy
118:23 - thing that I did with the train is
118:26 - everything is tied to the scale so the
118:29 - stroke weight I see I see um the like
118:34 - the size variable is actually affecting
118:36 - the let's take scale out for a
118:39 - second oh I have to
118:42 - save okay great so this is this is this
118:46 - is uh actually maybe better because
118:50 - everything is tied to the size variable
118:54 - as opposed to being tied to the scale so
118:57 - now if we were to say stroke weight 2.9
119:00 - like divided by this s it would
119:03 - technically work but maybe we don't we
119:06 - don't want it that
119:08 - small oh whoops hold on we
119:14 - lost what happened to oh did you take
119:16 - the main BB
119:18 - out no no I don't think so oh there it
119:22 - is it's back so
119:24 - strange um I like that size of the burb
119:27 - what size is
119:28 - that oh that's the
119:31 - default uh the default size of the BB oh
119:35 - my God my visual studio code keeps
119:38 - opening files in different places it's
119:41 - so weird Okay um I somebody was
119:45 - suggesting I think I can't find the
119:47 - message anymore but like I think the oh
119:50 - no that was oh yeah Alex was saying BP
119:52 - mindes so I don't know about minds but I
119:55 - was thinking like if instead of coming
119:59 - out of the train they were already like
120:02 - on the terrain like watching the train
120:05 - go by and they all have offsets in their
120:07 - in their animation like a forest you
120:10 - would be like the train would be going
120:12 - through a forest of BBS I feel like that
120:14 - super funny I like also rotate them to
120:17 - match the terrain so they would all like
120:19 - come out at slightly different
120:23 - angles we more or less have the building
120:25 - blocks for that already yes I do like
120:28 - that although I am now just like three
120:31 - lines of C away from getting them to
120:32 - like move out of fly
120:36 - away all right let's Okay
120:40 - okay but let's see hold on
120:43 - let's also you need to update them if
120:46 - they if they are to continue going
120:50 - up and down oh yes yes yes yes okay so
120:55 - ah why is my
121:03 - I okay I want to switch between the
121:06 - files okay so if I go to BB and I give
121:10 - it a
121:13 - uh a random
121:16 - vector and then in update
121:20 - we say uh and actually I shouldn't make
121:23 - it random let's just do like this way
121:24 - let's do VX equals
121:26 - random uh5 comma 0 and this VY equals
121:31 - random because it it needs to kind of go
121:33 - off in this direction and then if we say
121:38 - this dox plus equal this.
121:41 - VX this.y plus
121:45 - equal this. VY okay
121:52 - so
121:54 - why does the
121:58 - BB okay well I need to in sketch.
122:02 - JS update all the
122:06 - verbs yeah
122:09 - [Laughter]
122:12 - okay uh okay so now I think we can have
122:15 - it be a little more
122:17 - often
122:19 - and
122:21 - um we can
122:24 - like uh train X Plus train.
122:30 - WID that's divided by
122:37 - two what happened
122:39 - there okay that kind of looks like it's
122:41 - the right
122:44 - spot and now the
122:47 - BBS
122:50 - um so now what we need to do maybe is
122:53 - have the
122:56 - BBS uh Fade
122:58 - Out so is is there where are they
123:03 - getting their
123:06 - color and the other thing they could
123:08 - have
123:10 - is um an offset so that their animation
123:13 - isn't all synchronized everywhere like
123:16 - they're all blinking at the same time uh
123:20 - it I lost the code that I wrote again it
123:23 - like weirdly like reverted back to
123:26 - something
123:28 - else so I don't know what
123:34 - changed it's very I'm so thrown off by
123:37 - using this live share because all these
123:40 - things keep happening where I like the
123:42 - code is changing in multiple places and
123:43 - weird ways it does not work as elegantly
123:47 - as I might have thought CU now like what
123:49 - what just
123:51 - happened yeah I don't know I'm not doing
123:54 - anything right now I know no I believe
123:56 - you follow you I'm trying to just follow
123:59 - you it keeps like refreshing arbitrarily
124:01 - like I have it open in multiple
124:03 - places
124:05 - um I'm trying to close tabs so that I
124:08 - wonder if I should disconnect for
124:11 - like just to like finish this
124:15 - off okay but wait I just want to get
124:17 - back to what we had
124:19 - um why are the BBS coming out of strange
124:24 - locations what did we lose in the BB see
124:28 - look it like I haven't changed anything
124:29 - and all of a sudden this little dot of
124:32 - like unchanged code has come
124:34 - back and some some stuff that I CH oh
124:38 - there's
124:39 - like what is going on look this like
124:42 - this same line of code has been added
124:44 - hundreds of
124:45 - times oh my God look at this
124:50 - you don't see it because it's not in the
124:51 - Stream right now but like the like basic
124:54 - a ghost is in the machine okay I'm gonna
124:57 - disconnect from live share for a second
124:59 - yeah this try it
125:01 - has okay uh yeah session details okay I
125:06 - removed live share because that is crazy
125:12 - okay it uh
125:17 - now it's only in there one extra
125:23 - time okay the BBS are back it's back to
125:27 - the code that I had before so now if I
125:30 - go to uh give the BBS a
125:35 - lifespan of
125:37 - 255 now where do I get the oh the color
125:40 - is coming from the palet can I just in
125:43 - P5 add an alpha to every stroke let's
125:47 - find out like if it's it's getting a
125:49 - color from the palette can I just add a
125:51 - second argument we're about to find
125:54 - out you can no but you can do uh what's
125:58 - it called again fil no it's not filter
126:01 - oh set it what is the palette oh it's
126:03 - just an array of the strings of hex
126:07 - codes um ah what's what's that called
126:13 - again it's not color it's not
126:17 - filter
126:21 - uh
126:22 - so how would I have them Fade
126:28 - Out somebody in the chat is Gonna Know
126:31 - use P5 color set Alpha yeah but I have
126:34 - to make these all into a I was thinking
126:37 - I was thinking about tint yeah yeah
126:39 - Davis okay so I'd have to do
126:44 - like like does this
126:47 - work
126:54 - like this
126:55 - is sorry now you can't see what I'm
126:58 - doing I realized because I disconnected
126:59 - you no I can't
127:02 - Rel
127:04 - uh and stroke so this one would also be
127:10 - C the beak is pallette one I'm this is
127:15 - like the uh in most
127:19 - feel free to break anything like if you
127:21 - don't want to use
127:24 - the I'm staying true to your original
127:27 - code I will not break it
127:31 - I'm it
127:34 - was uh pallet
127:36 - one I I should probably make sure this
127:39 - works before I go through adding this to
127:40 - the rest of the code so we've got pallet
127:43 - one and now we've need uh I mean this is
127:47 - this is insane what I'm I'm doing I'm
127:49 - breaking all sorts of rules pallet
127:53 - two
127:57 - C3 okay I broke something an interesting
128:01 - this's an interesting tip from Emil who
128:03 - said click the three dots uh and enable
128:06 - lock group on the live
128:08 - preview this way it won't open code on
128:10 - the right lifespan is not Define oh
128:12 - this.
128:15 - lifespan cu the this do song
128:27 - uh line
128:29 - 34 okay we're back so now in update if I
128:34 - say this do lifespan minus
128:40 - minus they don't seem to be fading
128:44 - out that set Alpha didn't seem to work
128:55 - um okay let's just do something real
129:06 - quick I'm doing the head is the head
129:09 - fading out maybe it just wasn't fading
129:11 - out fast
129:12 - enough just start like say minus equal 5
129:16 - okay maybe it just wasn't fading out
129:18 - fast
129:19 - enough yeah the whole thing's fading out
129:21 - it does work it does work I just was
129:23 - barely fading it out
129:28 - okay and the live preview doesn't seem
129:30 - okay so now the BBS are fading
129:34 - away uh
129:37 - and uh I can then in ah in
129:47 - sketch.jpg if BB oh I need to do another
129:50 - loop to remove old BBS so for I do like
129:55 - I think your idea actually the idea of
129:56 - having the BBS as the terrain was better
129:59 - but I was like on this track right that
130:01 - I couldn't get off we could we could do
130:03 - both like we can have the BS coming out
130:05 - of as the smoke BBS and then the The
130:08 - Spectator or forest or tree BBS okay
130:12 - yeah as they're flying we don't really
130:13 - see them like um stretch yes
130:19 - yeah okay so first I need to go
130:23 - through um all of the
130:27 - burs and I guess I could do like call
130:29 - like filter or something but
130:32 - um if BBS index I lifespan is less than
130:39 - zero then a BBS
130:42 - splice uh I comma y so this
130:47 - should I've got some error
130:53 - again
131:03 - uh cannot read properties oh of
131:06 - undefined reading lifespan sketch JS
131:09 - line
131:12 - 35 oh length minus one okay there we go
131:17 - Okay so now now uh Kathy was also
131:20 - suggesting that the terrain I agree be
131:23 - higher so that way we'll have I guess
131:26 - she was saying it should be lower so
131:28 - there's more but I think it should be SP
131:31 - um but I think there should be if we
131:32 - want to add the BBS in the terrain we
131:35 - should uh we should make them higher the
131:38 - terrain higher so let me just make the
131:41 - terrain so oh it's 250 so we're g to add
131:44 - the BBS to the terrain and then we're
131:46 - going to be done
131:48 - and I really I feel like I should live
131:50 - share you back in I I I I don't like
131:53 - that we'd had to disconnect that but it
131:55 - was it went off the
131:57 - rails um okay so where is the terrain
132:02 - I'm gonna map it between height divided
132:05 - by four and three times height divided
132:08 - by four okay and for people who are
132:10 - asking what we're doing I think it's a
132:13 - good point to to remind people
132:15 - that that all of this all of this that
132:18 - we're doing this this all this nonsense
132:21 - is for a good cause because we are uh
132:24 - we're streaming as uh uh a donation
132:28 - Drive in a way of sorts for the for the
132:31 - annual fundraiser of the processing
132:32 - Foundation which is the organization
132:34 - that supports development of uh many of
132:37 - your favorite creative coding tools well
132:39 - many I don't know but uh but some for
132:41 - sure and uh and does a lot of other
132:43 - things and in particular we're
132:44 - celebrating the 10 years of the
132:46 - processing Foundation fell fellowship
132:48 - and if you click the link that is uh in
132:50 - the pinned message you will uh get to
132:53 - the donor box page and there you can
132:55 - donate if you wish to do so but you can
132:57 - also um yeah see more uh find links that
133:01 - will tell you more about what the
133:03 - foundation's about and what we're doing
133:04 - and uh yeah and if you want to uh find
133:07 - out more about what we said about it you
133:08 - can always go back to the beginning of
133:10 - the stream and uh and listen to
133:14 - that thank you for that okay I think I
133:18 - got something here which is that let
133:22 - make the
133:26 - sky uh okay I'm gonna get some colors
133:28 - for
133:30 - us that's gonna really work wonders here
133:36 - the sky is g to be oh that can't be that
133:38 - purple I don't think I have yellow in
133:42 - the okay the sky is yellow and the
133:46 - terrain is going to be let's try this
133:51 - this could be actually a good blue color
133:53 - for the sky and it can make the terrain
133:55 - yellow yeah there we go this is good
133:58 - then the terrain could
133:59 - be
134:05 - yellow now the
134:08 - uh oh the BBS are a little bit off in
134:11 - their position I was moving the train
134:14 - down um so I let me let me fix let me
134:18 - fix this I'm G to put this back
134:21 - in and
134:22 - [Music]
134:23 - then uh and then I'm going to set the Y
134:27 - terrain index plus this do height
134:30 - divided by
134:32 - two
134:33 - whoops no no no
134:37 - no uh gonna
134:40 - draw oh my God I'm losing my mind here
134:43 - oh I know what to
134:46 - do
134:51 - and the next y we'll just do this here
134:53 - there we go I wanted the train to be
134:55 - further into the terrain because now you
134:57 - don't notice so much that it is uh not
135:01 - following perfectly okay so now we can
135:04 - add the
135:05 - BBS to the terrain that it's navigating
135:09 - through so those will be a fixed list
135:13 - well I'll just make another
135:15 - array called terrain bir BS terrain BBS
135:20 - of course and uh we
135:24 - will uh for the
135:26 - terrain let's say for every uh well let
135:29 - me just do it
135:33 - separately uh let's just add let's just
135:35 - try adding 10 of them right
135:38 - now terrain BBS
135:41 - push new BB uh R I'm just going to put
135:46 - them in random places
135:48 - an X and A
135:49 - Y which will be uh the X will be
135:53 - somewhere random and the
135:57 - Y uh the Y should be I'm just gonna I'm
136:00 - going to make it randomly within the
136:01 - terrain in a moment but right now I'm
136:03 - just going to put them anywhere so
136:05 - there's going to be 10 random BBS and we
136:08 - need to show
136:10 - those uh but they can't move so BBS of B
136:16 - terrain BBs
136:20 - okay so what
136:24 - okay one uh
136:27 - 20 now where are those
136:33 - BBS ah wait a
136:37 - second the terrain
136:40 - is needs to be at the
136:44 - start okay got it we've got all the
136:46 - verbs now
136:48 - uh the train should go here but now what
136:51 - I need to do is in the BB we need to
136:53 - separate out the move from the length
136:57 - thing so I'm gonna what what would you
136:59 - call that like the length thing that
137:01 - it's
137:02 - doing uh stretch or stretch okay I like
137:06 - that yeah so I'll keep this as
137:11 - update and
137:14 - now
137:15 - um the
137:18 - um the terrain
137:22 - BBS uh
137:26 - stretch okay where I've got an
137:29 - error B oh stretch is not a
137:33 - function
137:35 - yeah so I don't have that in I guess I
137:38 - have to refresh yeah okay okay great the
137:41 - terrain BBS are in a fixed location and
137:44 - they're doing their
137:45 - stretch so we're going to have to give
137:47 - them them different offsets but also I
137:49 - need to make them only within the
137:51 - terrain so the way that I'll do that is
137:54 - in the main sketch H in the main
137:58 - sketch when I pick their random Y
138:01 - location where do I do that here it
138:04 - shouldn't be random height it has to be
138:06 - from the within the terrain range so the
138:12 - uh terrain Y is
138:16 - Terrain index x / step with a floor
138:22 - there and then uh the randomness is
138:25 - between terrain Y and height okay so
138:30 - let's make more of
138:34 - them okay so now I know you can't see
138:38 - this so we've got the BBS in the terrain
138:41 - all oscillating up and down I feel like
138:43 - we could make their size a little random
138:45 - so let's try that uh random
138:48 - 10 comma 30 yeah look at that okay but
138:51 - now we need them to offset so in the BB
138:56 - class that's the length that's mapping
139:00 - sign frame count so we just need them
139:02 - each to be on a different offset so I'm
139:04 - just going to give them this. offset
139:05 - equals random 2
139:07 - pi and the uh I'm just going to give
139:11 - this a temporary variable frame count
139:14 - time 0.1 plus this do off
139:18 - offset and then if I say angle
139:22 - here that should do it yes look at that
139:26 - okay I think we've completed this I
139:29 - think we should make it full but what I
139:33 - I will need to wait for the for for the
139:35 - stream to catch up so I can see the
139:37 - result but I I see I see some of it
139:39 - already it's really cool I'm going to
139:42 - now go away from live preview and what
139:45 - I'm going to do I think is put this into
139:47 - the web
139:48 - editor that way we can share it with
139:50 - people does that make sense do you think
139:52 - yeah yeah totally so let's go to the web
139:55 - editor and I create AET you have to
139:59 - create all the files again uh
140:04 - B decade of code with BBs and
140:10 - trains and then I need a uh verb. JS
140:16 - file and a train. JS file then if I go
140:22 - back
140:24 - here train.
140:26 - JS uh
140:28 - verb.
140:30 - JS uh sketch.
140:34 - JS
140:38 - whoops all right train is not defined oh
140:40 - right because then I need to add them to
140:42 - here to the index uh stop with the auto
140:46 - refresh
140:51 - train
140:53 - [Music]
140:55 - BB okay we've got it now here's oh
140:58 - there's a console log somewhere that I
140:59 - had
141:00 - left I don't know where it is let me
141:04 - find that uh yes get rid of that now
141:08 - what I would like to do just for the
141:12 - grand finale here is to uh see what
141:16 - happens if I go with window width and
141:21 - window
141:23 - height now we're not scaling things
141:25 - according to that and then hit share and
141:28 - go to full
141:30 - screen
141:32 - okay well I think there needs to be a
141:34 - lot more BBS in the
141:38 - terrain and the trrain could be bigger
141:42 - nice
141:44 - so dare I dare I attempt one last thing
141:50 - which is to make we we can leave uh we
141:53 - can leave a lot of those changes as an
141:55 - exercise to the audience okay but I just
141:58 - have to there's two things I could do
142:00 - really quickly one is to make the number
142:03 - of
142:04 - BBS relative to the size of the of the
142:09 - window so now that's that's done and I
142:12 - just want to make the train bigger and
142:14 - then I
142:16 - promise that's it so this should be well
142:18 - I'm just going to see what happens if I
142:19 - make this
142:21 - too uh it messed up other things but
142:23 - that's okay all right so I'll
142:27 - stop we have uh I'll make this full
142:31 - screen and uh hit
142:34 - refresh so now it's just you and me here
142:38 - Raphael watching the uh train pass
142:41 - through a sea of
142:44 - BBS
142:46 - amazing what
142:47 - a somehow there's still people here
142:50 - watching
142:52 - this yeah I mean I think so there's
142:56 - there are a couple things that people
142:58 - might want to do if they want to go and
143:00 - tweak that I was thinking while you were
143:02 - polishing things um the one thing that
143:05 - could be
143:07 - added oh wait could be could be
143:12 - randomized your your audio might have
143:13 - cut out for a second because I was
143:14 - pressing buttons ah okay no worries if
143:18 - you want so if you want to just start
143:19 - back with your
143:21 - suggestions yeah yeah so here are a few
143:23 - suggestions for people who might want to
143:25 - pick that up and maybe we can share the
143:26 - the link to the P editor sketch people
143:29 - can can copy paste it or like can
143:31 - duplicate it in their own collections um
143:34 - so yeah when you go there and you you
143:36 - can edit the code yourself in the P5
143:38 - editor um you can make sure to check out
143:41 - the different files because we haven't
143:43 - used a single sketch file we have this
143:44 - BB class and this train Class it's not
143:47 - the cleanest code at least mine
143:51 - isn't um and uh but yeah so one thing
143:55 - I'm thinking is the the BB orientation
143:58 - could be randomized so some BBS look
144:01 - right some BBS look left right now they
144:02 - all look in the same direction um and
144:06 - another thing and that's a little bit
144:08 - more advanced but uh right now there a
144:10 - lot of them are overlapping so there are
144:12 - a few things you could be doing to um
144:15 - either you embrace the fact that they're
144:17 - overlapping uh and you could have like
144:21 - add some fill color matching the
144:24 - background to each of the BBS so that
144:26 - when they are overlapping uh there's
144:29 - always one that is in front of the other
144:31 - and the other thing is it's the trick
144:32 - that I've seen a few people do um in the
144:35 - coding challenges is um some to sort the
144:42 - the Z of the array based on the Y
144:44 - position so that you draw the on that
144:47 - are the lowest you draw them last so
144:50 - that's um that's so yeah you you take an
144:53 - array you check the Y and you you switch
144:57 - them if one two by two if one is further
145:00 - down and that's how you you end up with
145:02 - a sorted array based on the Y position
145:05 - um I haven't done that trick myself but
145:07 - I've seen it done by people and it works
145:08 - really well and that you would have to
145:10 - do this together with that um with that
145:13 - fill thing the other solution would be
145:16 - you don't want them to overlap at all
145:18 - and then you do some kind of um like Pon
145:22 - disc sampling or or uh space like other
145:26 - kind of space filling algorithm like
145:27 - Circle packing uh and this way they
145:29 - would all have like each of them would
145:31 - have their own little space and they
145:32 - would be evenly evenly um sprinkled
145:35 - through the landscape that's another
145:37 - another possibility yeah and and from
145:40 - the train some things for the train that
145:42 - I think would really improve so one is
145:45 - uh the way that the train is drawn
145:49 - relative to its Center and using the
145:52 - scale function in combination with
145:54 - translate everything that I did today
145:57 - was like hacking it together in this
145:59 - really awful way based off of this
146:01 - original hard-coded set of numbers so I
146:05 - think you can see how like the trains
146:08 - the way that it's following the ter
146:09 - terrain the way that it's rotating
146:12 - especially now that I tried to make it a
146:13 - little bigger scaling it relative to the
146:15 - screen dimensions is is way off so that
146:18 - could be um very much improved I just
146:21 - want to show people something in case
146:23 - you wanted in case anybody who's
146:25 - watching this actually wanted to work on
146:27 - that which would be shocking mind you
146:29 - but um if I go to github.com I've Been
146:33 - Working on uh this uh myself if I go to
146:37 - the coding train GitHub repos there's a
146:39 - new one that's kind of undocumented I
146:41 - haven't called um logo
146:45 - animations and in the logo animations
146:48 - repo I just want to show this to people
146:50 - because if I had been more thoughtful
146:51 - about this I would have used this
146:53 - originally I have this file called data.
146:55 - Json which actually has um all of the uh
147:01 - information it says like every element
147:03 - of the logo it's like the shape type the
147:06 - X and Y coordinates the color and then I
147:09 - even have this like program it's a node
147:11 - script that will parse that and re and
147:15 - recalculate all of the numbers depending
147:17 - on what scale you want or what relative
147:19 - position you want and then I think if I
147:21 - go into logo. Json it actually writes
147:23 - that out so this logo. Json actually has
147:26 - all of the properties of the logo itself
147:29 - now relative to the center with a
147:31 - different scale and I'll just show you
147:33 - what I've been doing with this just so
147:35 - you can see um if if you all don't mind
147:39 - uh indulging me for a minute here what
147:41 - if you look at this repo and I'm just
147:44 - going to quickly clone
147:45 - it
147:47 - and I'm sorry Raphael that you can't see
147:49 - this uh in real
147:52 - time um and I I should just Host this
147:55 - with GitHub Pages or something but if I
147:58 - go to this now like for example here is
148:01 - a version of the logo where all of the
148:04 - elements just start moving around and
148:06 - flocking
148:08 - individually uh here is a version of
148:10 - logo where just all of the pieces fly in
148:13 - and come together in a little animation
148:16 - and then here's another one which uh
148:18 - uses a physics library to have it like
148:21 - uh fall apart um when the logo reaches
148:24 - the bottom and everything bounces around
148:26 - so you could tell I've been I've been
148:28 - trying this is really what the thing
148:29 - that I'm working on and I me keep
148:31 - meaning to do some live streams about
148:33 - and integrate it's my idea for I'm I I
148:36 - Sor I'm off on this coding train tangent
148:38 - I know this a processing Foundation
148:40 - video but um so one of the things that
148:42 - I'm hoping to do is have little logo
148:44 - animations at the beginning of different
148:46 - live streams and coding Challenge videos
148:48 - so anyone's interested in that you might
148:50 - be able to pull from that and integrate
148:52 - it into here and have a lot more control
148:56 - over how you're manipulating the train
148:59 - um so what's the best way I I posted a
149:01 - link to the um P5 sketch in the chat um
149:06 - what I'll do is as soon as we're done
149:09 - I'll make sure the link to the sketch is
149:10 - also in the video description so it's
149:13 - there forever I'm trying to think if
149:15 - people make their own version of this uh
149:18 - what's the best way for them to share it
149:20 - back with us maybe I know social media
149:22 - is kind of like a fraught complicated
149:24 - space but where are you these days uh
149:27 - Raphael that um um you that where we
149:30 - might suggest people share
149:32 - back yeah I mean I I'm am ashamed to
149:35 - admit I'm still on uh still on Twitter
149:38 - uh been for years as well uh but um yeah
149:44 - also have a Discord channel uh disc
149:46 - Channel um Discord server uh called the
149:49 - BBS Nest uh where people are welcome to
149:52 - join and uh if they want to join my
149:54 - weekly challenge right now we're doing
149:56 - January so right uh the the weekly
149:59 - challenge is on hold but you can find it
150:02 - on Open processing um where it's uh it's
150:05 - pinned to the homepage uh and otherwise
150:09 - uh oh yeah no I don't have my somebody
150:11 - can share the link if if if it's allowed
150:14 - um but yeah that's also place where you
150:17 - can uh for the creative coders and I
150:20 - actually just remembered Kathy was
150:21 - helping who's in the chat and some other
150:23 - coding trained folks were helping with
150:25 - uh setting up a track look so um on the
150:28 - coding Train website um every there's a
150:31 - section called the uh passenger showcase
150:34 - which has uh it's a way for you to
150:36 - submit a P5 or or actually sorry doesn't
150:38 - have to be P5 uh any project and we can
150:41 - set up a page for this stream where you
150:43 - could submit uh versions of like like
150:46 - the the train BB the BB train um to that
150:50 - page so that's something that I could do
150:52 - um but I'm you know certainly on Twitter
150:54 - or I'm trying to get the coding train
150:56 - Instagram back up and running um that's
150:58 - a way that I can if you if you tag the.
151:00 - coding. Trin on Instagram but really
151:03 - share this with uh the processing
151:04 - Foundation this is all about I I we lost
151:06 - we lost the thread there for a moment
151:08 - this is really again just to remind you
151:09 - all this is all about the this stream
151:12 - today has been in celebration of uh 10
151:15 - years of processing Foundation
151:16 - fellowships um we talked about this at
151:18 - the beginning of the stream but in case
151:20 - you weren't there the p5js project
151:22 - actually started as a processing
151:24 - Foundation processing Foundation
151:26 - Fellowship by Lauren Lee McCarthy um and
151:30 - um we played a video that you can watch
151:32 - if you go to the pin comment or the link
151:34 - in the video description if you have the
151:36 - capacity to donate and support the F
151:38 - proing foundation and the fellowship
151:39 - program that's wonderful um but please
151:42 - engage with the processing Foundation
151:44 - Community its program s uh with
151:47 - Raphael's uh twitch channel the weekly
151:50 - coding challenge Raphael's twitch stream
151:51 - and the BBS Nest Discord the coding
151:54 - train has all of that stuff too that I'm
151:56 - sure you can find because you're stuck
151:58 - here watching the stream on the cing
151:59 - train YouTube channel so all of that's
152:01 - going to be linked from this channel
152:03 - itself um any uh uh any last uh I guess
152:08 - we can sometimes I usually I I'm always
152:11 - having trouble ending these things so we
152:13 - could just say goodbye but rapael we can
152:16 - just talk for a minute and see if
152:17 - there's any I we could just give it a
152:19 - minute I see that seay is still in the
152:20 - chat uh so thanks seay for I'm I'm very
152:24 - impressed for anybody who mess made a
152:27 - wrote a comment at the beginning of the
152:28 - stream and is somehow still here uh so
152:31 - thanks for all of you for tuning in
152:33 - today any last words you want to say
152:35 - rapael well yeah thank you to everybody
152:38 - who donated today and before since the
152:41 - the beginning of the fundraiser it's
152:42 - going the fundraiser is still running
152:44 - for for another week uh uh so you just
152:47 - uh jump onto Don box check out the the
152:51 - video about the fellowships and
152:52 - everything the nice little uh merch
152:55 - rewards that we prepared for you
152:57 - including beautiful enamel pin by Anna
153:00 - careras uh and uh yeah um what else
153:04 - thanks to everybody at the foundation
153:06 - for all the work that that they do um
153:10 - and the people who have been with us in
153:12 - the past people who joined lately I mean
153:15 - I'm also joined um joined more recently
153:19 - and uh and yeah it's been an incredible
153:22 - experience everybody is really really
153:23 - dedicated to the mission of the
153:25 - foundation um which isn't uh yeah which
153:28 - isn't an easy an easy thing to do
153:30 - supporting open source um inclusion
153:33 - diversity equity in the in the open
153:35 - source space and in the Art Space um
153:38 - focusing on education there's there's no
153:40 - money in in
153:41 - education um and uh and that makes
153:44 - things difficult but uh we can do what
153:46 - we do thanks to the generosity of
153:49 - everybody who has been donating and has
153:51 - been supporting in in small and big ways
153:53 - contribution doesn't have to be monetary
153:56 - it does help for sure but uh people who
153:58 - contribute code uh there's like Dave
154:01 - here in the chat has been doing
154:03 - incredible contributions to P5 lately
154:05 - but he's far from the only one this
154:07 - incredible an incredible community of
154:08 - contributors to p5js and I know that
154:11 - people who use uh the tools may not
154:14 - always be aware of what happens behind
154:15 - the scenes but it's like none of that is
154:18 - possible without an immense Global
154:21 - Village of people who are donating their
154:24 - time their money their emotional
154:27 - energy uh everything so that this uh so
154:31 - that these projects can live and that uh
154:34 - the discords get moderated like
154:36 - everything is uh is possible because of
154:39 - people people's work um that is uh that
154:43 - is rewarded in various ways uh not
154:46 - always monetary and for for older people
154:49 - who are who are just so generous with
154:51 - their time and they're their genius uh
154:55 - yeah I wanted to to say say this word
154:58 - it's impossible to name you all but you
155:00 - know who you are so thank you yes and
155:04 - thank you so thank you Rafael you they
155:05 - put that all eloquently it's a perfect
155:08 - note to end on uh thank you so much for
155:10 - joining today I have to say this is a
155:11 - real pleasure I I've been uh the the
155:14 - work that I've been doing in terms of
155:15 - the Cod train has been quite slow for
155:17 - the last year and I'm I'm excited to
155:19 - 2024 is here I've kind of made it a goal
155:21 - to do more and I'm realizing well it's
155:23 - really nice to be streaming with
155:24 - somebody else so I know we've done a
155:26 - couple collaborations where I was able
155:28 - to appear on your Twitch stream and this
155:29 - has been great to do this together to
155:31 - celebrate the processing foundation so
155:33 - maybe we can do more of this in the
155:34 - future and hopefully shine a light on
155:36 - other people in the space who are making
155:38 - work with code and supporting the
155:40 - foundation in other ways so um I usually
155:44 - have a end animation screen and some
155:46 - music that I play but with everything
155:48 - that I did to get the multi- guest set
155:51 - up today I kind of lost some other
155:53 - pieces of things that I usually have for
155:55 - my setup so I apologize I'm just going
155:57 - to literally hit a button that's going
155:59 - to just turn this thing off so um please
156:02 - if you uh if you were inspired to make
156:04 - anything with processing or P5 or any
156:07 - other tool maybe you want to can you
156:08 - make this in like uh Unity or uh maybe
156:12 - you could make an open Frameworks
156:13 - version of this I don't know so I I you
156:15 - know if you're just inspired by what we
156:17 - did today and make something I would
156:18 - really love to see it it always uh
156:20 - brings me so much joy to see what people
156:22 - are doing so please share with us in all
156:24 - the spaces we've talked about and I will
156:27 - see you all the next time live stream
156:30 - and yeah go ahead Rafael yeah in the
156:33 - chat just just wanted to highlight the
156:35 - message that Sig just posted chat so if
156:39 - you want uh if you need support for your
156:41 - projects and you want to know about the
156:43 - future Fellowship programs nothing has
156:45 - been announced for this year yet but if
156:47 - you have questions please reach out to
156:49 - Sig TSI eProcessing foundation.org uh
156:54 - with your questions about fellowships if
156:56 - you want to be a fellow if you have a
156:58 - project you wonder if it's a good fit
156:59 - for the fellowships uh please uh contact
157:02 - Sig and uh you'll get all the
157:04 - information you need that's all amazing
157:07 - H wonderful all right thank you
157:09 - everybody uh if you uh if you're
157:11 - somewhere where there's snow uh enjoy
157:14 - that I'm going to go traes through it
157:15 - right now and we'll see you all next
157:19 - time wherever we might be on the
157:22 - internet slowly walking over to press
157:25 - the
157:25 - button okay here it is I'm moving the
157:28 - mouse I'm gonna click this button it
157:29 - says end stream goodbye
157:33 - everybody
157:36 - bye okay I did it I hit the end stream
157:39 - button
