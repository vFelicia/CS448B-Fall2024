00:00 - welcome to part two of Plinko coating
00:02 - challenge I actually just during the
00:04 - little break I just took between part
00:05 - one and part two I made a quick list
00:07 - with help from the chat here's the
00:08 - things that I'm going to do I'm going to
00:10 - increase the gravity of the world so
00:11 - that things don't look so sluggish as
00:12 - they're falling I got to make sure I
00:14 - delete any particles that leave the
00:16 - window although at some point I'm going
00:18 - to put boundaries so actually I might
00:20 - hold off on that because I was going to
00:21 - add boundaries around the whole world so
00:23 - that they can't leave the window because
00:25 - the idea is to fill up the buckets at
00:26 - the bottom but uh um then I uh and I
00:30 - want to add buckets at the bottom to
00:31 - fill those things up and then I actually
00:33 - might make this a part three let's see
00:34 - if we can add a little bit of sound with
00:35 - say as they hit the things as a little
00:37 - like ding ding sounds or whatever maybe
00:38 - I can record the Bell really quickly and
00:40 - use that sound okay uh so let me look
00:44 - over here and see what I can do so
00:47 - gravity is part of something so there
00:50 - conceptually there's a world and there's
00:52 - particles and there's Plinko gravity is
00:54 - not part of a Plinko or Peg or a
00:57 - particle it's part of the world so I can
00:59 - actually look here in the console and I
01:00 - can just type world to look and see what
01:02 - the properties of the world are there's
01:04 - bounds which is something I want to look
01:05 - at which has a maximum and a minimum X
01:07 - and Y whoops which is I clicked the
01:09 - wrong thing come on click again you can
01:11 - see those are Infinity because I haven't
01:13 - said any bounds and then there's gravity
01:15 - which has a scale I don't 100% know what
01:17 - that is I should look it up in the
01:18 - documentation but I have an X and A Y so
01:20 - one thing I can the Y is one right now I
01:23 - can actually just say world.
01:26 - gravityy equal 2 so let me double the Y
01:29 - so it points Point down a little bit
01:30 - more and you can see can you see that
01:32 - that's moving let's just make it more
01:33 - extreme just so you can really see let's
01:35 - make this 10 and you can see that
01:37 - gravity is so much stronger right now so
01:40 - that's kind of useful in terms of
01:42 - getting things to fall a bit more okay
01:44 - so changing the gravity to two I'm going
01:46 - to leave it for that right now the next
01:47 - thing on my list over here was add
01:50 - bounds and there is a thing in the world
01:52 - object in addition to gravity called
01:53 - bounds but I'm not going to use that
01:55 - that's more I think for where you're
01:57 - doing Collision detection instead what
01:59 - I'm going to do is just add some um
02:01 - objects myself so I'm going to yet again
02:03 - I'm going to just from particle. JS I'm
02:06 - going to do a save as and I'm going to
02:08 - call this a boundary boundary. JS I'm
02:11 - going to make an object that has a x a y
02:15 - and a width and a height it's going to
02:17 - be and this should be uh a
02:20 - boundary and it has it's it is something
02:23 - that's a
02:25 - static and instead of making a circle
02:27 - it's going to be a rectangle again I'm
02:30 - doing a lot of redundant code here but
02:32 - and then I'm going to keep track of the
02:35 - width and the height in separate
02:39 - variables and um I'm going to uh say
02:42 - boundary. prototype. show and this
02:45 - should be a rectangle with a width and a
02:48 - height so what I've done very quickly is
02:50 - show you how you can create a
02:53 - rectangular Body by using bodies.
02:54 - rectangle keeping tra a width and height
02:56 - instead of a radius otherwise everything
02:58 - else is the same ah I need need to add
03:00 - rotation at some point don't let me
03:01 - forget because these things are rotating
03:03 - as they're moving around okay so for
03:05 - this what I'm going to do just really
03:07 - quickly is I'm also going to make an
03:09 - array call it
03:11 - bounds and I'm going to at the end of
03:14 - setup just put one at the bottom VAR b
03:18 - equals a new boundary and so the
03:20 - rectangle is actually thought of based
03:22 - on its Center matter dos I'm going to
03:24 - say width divided by two it's going to
03:26 - be at uh
03:28 - height
03:30 - um and I'm actually going to like push
03:32 - it off so what I want is its location to
03:37 - be at height plus
03:39 - 50 because I want its uh width to be the
03:44 - entire width of the
03:46 - window and I want its height to be if
03:50 - it's plus 50 I want its height to be
03:52 - like 100 so it's actually not going to
03:54 - show up on the
03:56 - screen but and I'm oh boundar is not
03:58 - defined because of course I forgot to
04:00 - add it to my index. HTML so I have
04:03 - another JavaScript file come on
04:06 - boundary. JJs here we go and boundar is
04:10 - not defined in setup so what am I
04:13 - missing here um new boundary ah what did
04:16 - I probably boundary boundary boundary
04:19 - that looks right uh index.html I've got
04:22 - boundary. JS sketch b equals new
04:26 - boundary H let's try that again
04:30 - syntax error line number three boundary.
04:32 - JS sorry about that uh is static true ah
04:35 - there should not be a semicolon there
04:37 - creating an object in JavaScript you
04:39 - separate the properties with commas with
04:40 - only one property I don't even need the
04:42 - commas okay apologies for that and here
04:44 - we go so now what we should see is I got
04:46 - to wait a little while but when the ball
04:48 - falls to the bottom there you got you
04:50 - can see that it's there's now a boundary
04:52 - down there so that's perfect that's what
04:54 - I want um and I I I guess I'm not going
04:56 - to make this 800 because it's um kind of
04:59 - going off a little too low down so let's
05:01 - just make this uh 600 by 700 just to
05:04 - push it up a little bit okay that's
05:05 - pretty good okay another thing that I
05:07 - could do here is if you notice every
05:08 - other I don't know if this is really
05:10 - necessary but it does feel like there
05:12 - should be another particle right here
05:13 - another Peg right there so that is the
05:16 - odd row so in the odd row uh what if
05:20 - well what if I just did this would
05:22 - anybody really care yeah that's fine
05:25 - there's an extra one also for the even
05:26 - ones I could be more thoughtful about
05:28 - this but that's what I'm going to do
05:29 - right now Okay so we've got the stuff
05:31 - falling down and landing in the bottom
05:34 - okay I definitely need to do something I
05:35 - was wrong uh I do want to delete
05:38 - particles that fall off the edge because
05:40 - maybe they're not all going to end up in
05:42 - the bottom um so I should add something
05:44 - where I check if anything is way off
05:46 - screen to remove it to kind of keep
05:48 - things more efficient so let's add that
05:50 - next and what I need to do to do that is
05:53 - I need each particle is the only thing
05:54 - that's moving so I'm going to say
05:56 - particle. prototype uh Dot um
06:01 - offscreen equals a function and I'm just
06:04 - going to say
06:06 - um what makes it off screen if
06:10 - x return X is less than zero
06:14 - that's let's let's say x is less than 00
06:18 - not X okay so first of
06:20 - all x equals this. body. position dox so
06:25 - that's actually the object's location
06:27 - it's the body's positions X right
06:29 - physics the physics engine matter.js is
06:31 - controlling everything y equals and you
06:34 - know what I kind of wanted to make a
06:35 - nice if statement that I just return a
06:37 - Boolean not an if statement a nice
06:39 - Boolean expression that returns true or
06:40 - false let's just make this simpler if x
06:42 - is less than 50 or X is greater than I'm
06:46 - just going to use a buffer of 50 y + 50
06:50 - uh then return
06:52 - true uh else and I'm doing this in a
06:54 - radically inefficient way but I don't
06:56 - actually ever need to check the top so I
06:59 - can actually just say
07:00 - return if any of these is TR if any of
07:03 - these are true then it's off the screen
07:06 - so I can use an or return the result of
07:09 - all of these
07:11 - or Y is greater than height plus 50 I'm
07:16 - I'm like hearing the YouTube comments
07:17 - already don't use a long- winded if
07:19 - statement where you could do it in one
07:20 - line of code but this is like kind of
07:22 - cryptic to watch to read but if an or
07:25 - statement if any of things in an or
07:27 - statement are true like false or false
07:29 - or false or false or false or true the
07:32 - whole thing is true right if I'm you
07:34 - know uh yeah okay so if one of these
07:38 - things are true the whole thing is going
07:39 - to return true so now what I need to do
07:41 - is in this Loop here where I'm dealing
07:44 - with all the
07:46 - particles if particles index i. is
07:53 - offscreen then I want to say particles
07:57 - index uh particles. sput
08:00 - I comma 1 so I just did this in a
08:02 - matter.js tutorial earlier I'll link to
08:05 - it where I kind of went through the
08:07 - pitfall here because I'm moving taking
08:09 - things out of the array while I'm
08:10 - iterating through it so really a a quick
08:13 - fix that I can do here is just um that I
08:16 - did in that video is I can just subtract
08:18 - one from I because the problem is if I'm
08:20 - removing the I element the other
08:22 - elements slide into it and then I add
08:24 - one I end up skipping over it so this is
08:26 - going to cause me not to skip anything
08:28 - and this should remove anything that's
08:30 - off the screen and of course I have an
08:32 - error particles index I is off screen is
08:34 - not a function uh why is it not a
08:37 - function particle oh I just called it
08:39 - off screen let's call it is off
08:41 - screen there we go so one thing I want
08:44 - to do just to be sure this is really
08:45 - working is let's not check let's not
08:47 - check the bottom um let's
08:50 - check uh let's check you know to see if
08:53 - they go over 100 pixels so we should see
08:57 - them remove now I did I forgot some
08:59 - something really important in addition
09:01 - to removing it from my array I need to
09:03 - tell matter.js that it's not part of the
09:05 - physics anymore so what I'm going to do
09:07 - F I'm having like a groundhog day Deja
09:10 - Vu thing uh where I'm removing it I also
09:13 - need to
09:15 - say partic uh I need to say uh um
09:20 - particles no no no no
09:23 - world world. remove World particles
09:27 - index ibody I think think that's it so I
09:30 - want to tell the matter.js world so I
09:33 - want to remove something from the
09:34 - matter.js world the world function is
09:36 - namespaced in the world object so world.
09:39 - remove from this world which is my world
09:41 - this particular particle's body so take
09:43 - this out of the physics world then
09:45 - delete it from the array then go back
09:46 - one so let's see if that
09:49 - works
09:50 - uh so one thing one way to check if this
09:53 - works by the way is now what I'm going
09:55 - to do is I'm not going to um
10:00 - I'm not going to remove it from my array
10:01 - but I'm going to remove it from the
10:02 - physics world so let's just take that
10:04 - out this is a good way of debugging to
10:06 - see if it works so let's see if after
10:08 - 100 the physics stopped so that that
10:10 - actually did work did I get I probably
10:12 - got like a weird why did it that's
10:14 - interesting how it stopped doing
10:15 - anything but I can see plainly that this
10:17 - is doing what I want it to do um I'm
10:19 - pretty sure this is right um anybody
10:22 - pretty anybody tell tell me if I've done
10:24 - something wrong but I think I've got
10:26 - this in the right order and I can go
10:28 - back to my particle object and change
10:30 - this to like height I don't actually
10:32 - need the height at all I only care if it
10:34 - goes because the the bottom is the
10:37 - bottom has a hard boundary so I'm
10:38 - actually just going to take that out I
10:40 - don't need that at all so I actually
10:42 - don't need to check I'm only going to
10:44 - check if it's off screen on the
10:46 - why oh something
10:49 - froze oh I crashed this
10:52 - particular let's just see if this comes
10:54 - back and it works again okay um so this
10:56 - should be doing fine I want to check
10:58 - here's actually a way that I can check
11:00 - so nothing's been removed so far I can
11:02 - say um particles. length there's six
11:06 - right now um particles. length seven
11:09 - particles. length seven come on leave
11:11 - the world
11:12 - people checking if it's
11:15 - working let me debug to see if this is
11:17 - really working and I I want to be
11:20 - thoughtful about this so because I I
11:22 - really want to make sure that I've done
11:23 - the code correctly and I think this will
11:24 - show you a good way to debug this is
11:26 - what I'm going to do is actually
11:27 - completely take out all the
11:30 - Plinko so now I have to have this oh
11:32 - look at that
11:34 - who that's oh no no I got to do this I
11:38 - okay now there's no Plinko okay so now
11:41 - that there's no Plinko and I'm also
11:43 - going to remove this
11:45 - boundary and then I I actually
11:48 - unfortunately now need to go back and
11:50 - add this y back in or Y is greater than
11:53 - height so the way that I'm going to know
11:55 - that this works is um uh put this back
12:00 - in the way that I'm going to know that
12:02 - this is actually working is by looking
12:05 - at the length of the array so particles.
12:08 - length is one it's never going to be
12:11 - more than one because by the time the
12:13 - next one comes one's been removed the
12:15 - question is world. bodies is what
12:18 - matter.js thinks is there is that also
12:21 - one it is so things are working right
12:24 - because if I took out my um if I took
12:29 - out this world. remove if I didn't
12:32 - remove it from the matter.js world I
12:34 - could look at particles. length and I'm
12:36 - going to continuously see one but now
12:39 - there's going to be three in the world's
12:40 - body so I need to make sure it's being
12:42 - removed from both places so now that now
12:45 - that I feel confident that that's
12:46 - working I can put my boundary back in at
12:49 - the bottom and I can put the uh Plinko
12:53 - back in here okay here we go
12:57 - now looking at my
12:59 - list what do I have left I've increased
13:03 - the gravity I'm removing particles I
13:05 - added a boundary at the bottom I need to
13:07 - add buckets so what I want to do is just
13:09 - add some little separators here and I
13:11 - probably want to align them right with
13:13 - that
13:14 - first um with that first uh row that
13:17 - probably is the way I'm supposed to do
13:18 - it although I'm sure there's a specific
13:20 - layout okay let's add those so how many
13:23 - those need
13:25 - to um let's add those okay so what I
13:28 - need to do those are also going to be
13:30 - boundaries so I'm going to use that
13:32 - boundaries array boundaries. push B and
13:36 - now I'm going to write a loop that's
13:37 - similar I only need to do it for one set
13:41 - of columns so let me say I equals um I
13:46 - equals z i is less than column I want to
13:48 - do all these
13:50 - columns uh and what I want to do is say
13:54 - the x is I *
13:57 - spacing right that's what it is is
14:00 - for um let's just see let's see what
14:03 - goes on let me try X is X is I *
14:06 - spacing the Y is the bottom so let me
14:10 - think of a height here I'm going to
14:11 - those buckets are going to have a
14:13 - height they're going to be rectangles
14:15 - that are going to have a height of like
14:16 - I don't know let's just try like 30
14:18 - pixels and a width of like 10 pixels so
14:22 - the Y is going to be if I want it to be
14:25 - a boundary that sits um on top of the
14:28 - floor
14:29 - the Y is height minus h / 2 because I
14:33 - need a rectangle this is confusing but
14:36 - basically if this is the bottom this is
14:39 - my rectangle this is its height this is
14:43 - this is the canvas's height minus height
14:47 - divided two is this location here so
14:50 - once I do that then I can create
14:54 - a new boundary and I'm reusing a
14:57 - variable name which is probably a bad
14:58 - idea
14:59 - but I can create another new boundary
15:02 - which is
15:03 - at X comma y with comma height because I
15:07 - calculated all that already and I can
15:09 - also say boundaries. push B and the
15:12 - reason why I want to put it into an
15:13 - array is because I also want to say
15:19 - um I also want to display all them so
15:22 - for all the boundaries uh boundaries
15:25 - indexi doow now what does the bound show
15:29 - function have it shows a rectangle and
15:32 - let me I have let me say fill Z stroke Z
15:36 - let me get a different color here and
15:38 - uncaught reference error boundaries is
15:40 - not defined at
15:42 - setup boundaries boundaries boundar did
15:44 - I not make a boundaries
15:46 - array oh I called it bounds so that's
15:49 - nice because it's a little bit shorter
15:51 - of course now I have to change it
15:52 - everywhere so bounds. push bounds. push
15:56 - and then I need to Loop through that
15:58 - sound array okay there we
16:01 - go those are so tiny look at the tiny I
16:05 - really okay so those are going to be uh
16:07 - have to be um much taller I guess I
16:11 - wasn't really thinking uh and I don't
16:13 - know why let's they could be white I
16:14 - don't know why I was like I had to
16:15 - change their color so um in the uh uh
16:20 - where am I boundary um let me make the
16:23 - color
16:25 - white and uh here let me color white and
16:28 - then then uh what am I doing now on
16:31 - sketch where I create them let's make
16:33 - the height 100 my goodness why are you
16:35 - being so stingy okay does this so uh and
16:39 - then I could use one extra one right I
16:41 - could use one extra one
16:44 - here not cut that off of my laptops I
16:46 - could use an extra one I could use an
16:48 - extra one um so I already said columns
16:52 - plus one columns plus two wait why am I
16:56 - not getting oh cuz it's it's there but
16:57 - it's right off the screen
17:01 - no uh so let me just offset it a little
17:04 - bit uh 10
17:07 - plus yeah uh I just
17:11 - see U minus 10 just to offset it yeah
17:14 - yeah it's there so I just I have to
17:16 - finesse the spacing and stuff a little
17:18 - bit um so I'm going to just leave it at
17:22 - that uh because there's one what I want
17:25 - is but it should be at the center right
17:27 - so X is I time spacing so X is zero um
17:32 - and the width is 10 so I should see five
17:35 - pixels on and five pixels off what if I
17:37 - change this to
17:38 - 20 what what am I doing wrong here oh I
17:42 - know what I'm doing wrong I have I'm not
17:45 - drawing it correctly no
17:49 - wonder so I don't know if that some of
17:51 - that thinking could be edited out I need
17:53 - to move this up again because it's too
17:54 - low for me um but uh I forgot a really
17:57 - really key thing if I go into the
17:59 - boundaries look at this I'm drawing the
18:01 - rectangles in the default way that P5
18:04 - thinks of rectangles with 0 0 in the top
18:06 - left and that's why they're actually so
18:08 - short I'm just drawing them in the
18:09 - completely wrong place whereas matter.js
18:12 - thinks of rectangles with the
18:13 - registration point in the center so I
18:15 - need to have but I'm drawing match what
18:17 - matter.js things which I need to say w
18:19 - mode Center so here we
18:21 - go there we go so now it's right and you
18:23 - can see I that's what I expected it to
18:25 - do it had one sort of half off at the
18:27 - edge so you can see here are my uh
