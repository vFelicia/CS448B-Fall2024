00:00 - hello welcome to another coding
00:02 - challenge this coding challenge will
00:04 - happen in two parts it actually picks up
00:06 - from two previous videos all leading up
00:09 - to eventually making this thing over
00:11 - there that's kind of undulating
00:12 - oscillating called the super shape so
00:14 - I'm going to get to the super shape not
00:16 - in this video but the one that follows
00:17 - this one because the first thing I need
00:19 - to do in this particular video before I
00:21 - can figure out how to make the
00:23 - crazy-looking super shape is simply just
00:25 - how to draw a sphere I'm going to do
00:28 - this in processing which is a Java based
00:30 - creative coding environment now first I
00:33 - should mention if I just want to draw a
00:35 - sphere I can actually do this really
00:36 - easily so here I'm just going to say it
00:38 - set up I'm going to say sighs let's have
00:41 - a nice window that's like 600 by 600 and
00:43 - I'm going to use the 3d rendering engine
00:45 - P 3d in draw I'm gonna say background
00:49 - zero that happen to say I like to just
00:51 - I'm feeling giddy while doing this I'm
00:53 - going to say fill 255 I'm going to say
00:56 - translate with / - height / - and then
00:59 - I'm just going to say sphere I don't
01:01 - know I'm gonna say like 200 and then I'm
01:03 - also going to say lights lights camera
01:06 - action and then I'm gonna run the sketch
01:08 - and I thereafter come on oh and then
01:10 - look I have a sphere so this was
01:12 - actually really really easy to draw a
01:14 - sphere because processing has built into
01:17 - it a function called sphere that would
01:19 - just create a sphere but you'll notice
01:21 - the sphere isn't actually a sphere I
01:24 - mean of course it's not anything at all
01:26 - your this is like pixels in some sort of
01:28 - big YouTube space and maybe I'm just
01:30 - pixels and somebody else's imagination I
01:32 - don't know maybe everything we are is
01:33 - some kind of weird computer simulation
01:35 - and I'm I think I've lost I've lost
01:37 - track here back to what's at hand is it
01:42 - what it is is it's a lot of triangles
01:44 - all placed next to each other and you
01:46 - can see those triangles if i zoom up
01:48 - here and these are actually known as
01:49 - triangle strips because of these there's
01:51 - this horizontal or vertical strips of
01:53 - triangles so what I want to show you in
01:54 - this video is how to draw these
01:56 - triangles yourself because if you can
01:58 - draw them yourself then you can start to
02:01 - move the triangles around so they
02:02 - undulate you could color them with
02:04 - different colors individually you could
02:05 - texture them with an image there's all
02:07 - sorts of types of things you can do and
02:09 - ultimately what the super shape is is
02:11 - it's like having
02:12 - spear but taking certain points of the
02:14 - sphere and pulling them out and pushing
02:16 - them in based on some other math so
02:18 - that's what I want to do in this
02:19 - particular video okay so what's
02:23 - something that we need to become
02:24 - familiar with so one thing that I think
02:26 - that would be worth discussing briefly
02:28 - awkward shuffle this way button press
02:32 - hello hello we're still here would be to
02:36 - talk about how do we look how do we how
02:39 - do we think about talk about and
02:41 - consider the points on a sphere so
02:43 - you've probably heard of something that
02:45 - could always completely confuses me and
02:47 - I get it backwards I was a about 75% of
02:49 - the time that I talk about it and
02:50 - hopefully this is going to be the 25% of
02:52 - the time but you've probably heard of
02:54 - something called latitude and longitude
02:55 - so if you think about the earth as a
02:57 - globe and I could draw the globe here is
02:59 - like here's a circle which pen is not so
03:01 - great and I could kind of draw these
03:03 - strips here trying to use my best
03:07 - artistic talent to make something that
03:09 - looks 3d esque and you can think of this
03:12 - in a way it's like okay there is a grid
03:14 - of columns and rows and if we were to
03:22 - take this flat two-dimensional grid and
03:25 - take it and kind of wrap it around a
03:26 - sphere you know it's this way this is
03:28 - like the map of the earth that we've
03:30 - taken and wrapped around a sphere and
03:31 - each point along the sphere is
03:33 - represented by a longitude meaning which
03:39 - one of these columns so to speak by a
03:42 - latitude which one of these rows so to
03:46 - speak and the latitude in the middle is
03:48 - you know referred to as the equator now
03:52 - these can be you know there's lots of
03:54 - different ways of kind of measuring
03:56 - latitude and longitude minutes and
03:58 - seconds and there's the prime meridian
04:00 - and all this stuff I'm I would love to
04:02 - do another video about mapping I think I
04:04 - will get to that at some point but for
04:06 - us right here the measurements that
04:07 - we're going to use our angles it's kind
04:09 - of an angle of rotation you can think of
04:11 - it and longitude goes between negative
04:13 - 180 degrees to 180 degrees and latitude
04:18 - right so that's a full kind of 360 all
04:21 - the way around that globe but latitude
04:24 - only needs to go between
04:25 - negative 90-degree over a 90 degrees and
04:28 - negative 90 degrees so these ranges will
04:31 - cover every point on the globe there's
04:34 - some nuance to this but I'm kind of
04:35 - doing this in a sort of basic pure loose
04:37 - way so what I need to do is have a loop
04:40 - just like you might have a nested loop
04:41 - for pixel's X knocking over cameras just
04:46 - like you might have a nested loop for
04:47 - pixels pixels 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 what I want
04:50 - to do is have a nested loop for
04:51 - longitude values and latitude values
04:56 - hopefully I got this right well redo
04:59 - this video or put lots of YouTube
05:00 - annotations all over it people on the
05:02 - Internet are really gonna get mad at me
05:03 - if I get this wrong okay so what I'm
05:05 - going to do is I'm going to now get rid
05:08 - of this line of code that's this sphere
05:10 - 200 and what I'm going to do is and I'm
05:13 - going to say and you don't have to do
05:15 - something strange instead of actually
05:18 - doing my loop from negative PI to PI or
05:22 - negative hundred 80 degrees to 180
05:24 - degrees I'm going to do something a
05:25 - little different I'm just going to say I
05:27 - goes from 0 to like 100 and then I'm
05:31 - going to have a nested loop inside that
05:32 - J goes from 0 to 100 and what the 100 is
05:38 - kind of going to refer to is how many
05:40 - points what's my detail level of this
05:44 - sphere and actually processing as a
05:46 - sphere detail function I can set that
05:48 - for the the automatic spheres that are
05:49 - drawn so like how like fine is the
05:52 - resolution how many points across how
05:54 - many points below so I'm going to do
05:57 - that and then what I want to do is then
06:02 - take every eye so let's have I be the
06:05 - longitude values
06:07 - I think that'll make sense so I need a
06:10 - longitude value which is mapping I from
06:12 - 0 to 100 and let's make that 100 a
06:14 - variable now so I am is between 0 and
06:21 - and each one of those should then map to
06:23 - the range of negative PI to PI and then
06:28 - the latitude should map between negative
06:32 - 1/2 PI to
06:37 - half pie okay I think I'm doing pretty
06:40 - well here and I'm going to change this
06:44 - to total and total now whoops and I'm
06:49 - going to change I'm going to save this
06:50 - as a sphere geometry okay so now I need
06:57 - to do something more so let me just run
06:59 - this to make sure it doesn't crash or
07:02 - give me any errors okay so this seems
07:03 - reasonable it's working now here's the
07:05 - thing what I need to do is take those
07:08 - each one of these latitude and longitude
07:11 - values which we can think of as a pair
07:15 - of values and have some math to convert
07:18 - that to an XY Z value now this is
07:21 - something quite similar to what I've
07:24 - done before and actually by the way this
07:27 - should really be written like this are
07:31 - common latitude longitude because I
07:33 - really have three values are being the
07:35 - radius of that sphere this is very
07:38 - similar to something I've done in
07:39 - previous videos if I have R and theta a
07:42 - radius and an angle I need to convert
07:44 - that to an XY value this is kind of
07:48 - polar coordinates right if I have a
07:52 - radius and a theta I need to convert
07:55 - that to an X and a Y and their formulas
07:57 - for that R equals sorry x equals R times
08:02 - cosine of theta y equals R times sine of
08:05 - theta now if this polar two Cartesian
08:08 - coordinate transformation is unfamiliar
08:10 - to you I would suggest looking at one of
08:12 - my previous videos where I cover that in
08:14 - more detail but what I need to do is
08:16 - essentially apply the same kind of math
08:18 - but it's a bit more complex math because
08:20 - instead of having I have one radius but
08:22 - instead of one angle I essentially have
08:24 - two angles and the results I want
08:26 - instead of having an X and a Y I have an
08:28 - X and Y and a Z so let's go and look at
08:31 - a look at how that works okay so there's
08:34 - a nice place on the internet you may
08:35 - have heard of it where I could behind
08:36 - those formulas it's called Wikipedia and
08:39 - I have them right here and these are the
08:42 - formulas for converting from latitude
08:45 - and longitude and I believe in this case
08:47 - that theta refers to low
08:50 - Mangia tude and the fee or fie symbol
08:52 - fee fie foe fum fum symbol refers to its
08:56 - a Greek letter fee but I think it's
08:58 - often informally pronounced Phi I don't
09:00 - know why is a latitude hopefully I got
09:03 - that right and when we find out that I
09:05 - got it wrong we'll fix it okay so these
09:07 - are the formulas I need x equals R times
09:10 - sine of longitude cosine of latitude so
09:13 - let's put that in to the code x equals R
09:19 - times what what did I say sine of
09:24 - longitude x times cosine of latitude you
09:30 - know I'm not deriving these formulas I
09:33 - don't know that I could just do that off
09:34 - the top of my head right now if people
09:35 - are interested in that I could make a
09:36 - sort of side video and then y equals R
09:40 - times sine of longitude sine of latitude
09:42 - sine of longitude sine of latitude and Z
09:46 - equals R times what cosine of longitude
09:50 - and what is R well by the way when I
09:55 - drew the sphere automatically I gave it
09:56 - a value of 200 I'm pretty sure that
09:58 - would be the radius so what I want to
10:00 - say here is float R equals no know about
10:08 - to stick to remember what I'm doing 200
10:10 - okay so now we should have a longitude
10:14 - or latitude mapped in a nested loop and
10:16 - calculate an XYZ so let's do something
10:19 - simple and just say stroke 255 and say
10:23 - point X Y Z and let's hope that we get
10:27 - something that looks like a sphere oh no
10:31 - that doesn't look right at all ooh
10:35 - interesting though what did I do wrong
10:37 - okay timeout pause okay back after
10:42 - debugging I had a really silly error
10:44 - here where I'm used using I in both of
10:47 - the loops so I is the value that's going
10:50 - across for all the longitudes and J is
10:52 - the value that's going down for all the
10:54 - latitudes and by the way if I want to
10:56 - calculate my latitude I need to use J so
10:58 - now we should see what do I get these
11:01 - are all the points of the sphere
11:03 - it's sort of hard to see that this is a
11:05 - sphere because it kind of just looks
11:06 - like a lot of points in two dimensions
11:09 - in like these radial circles so one
11:11 - thing that I'm going to do to be able to
11:12 - manipulate this scene very quickly and
11:14 - easily is add a processing library
11:16 - called PZ cam I've shown in other videos
11:19 - how to install it but so I'm just going
11:21 - to go here I already have it installed
11:22 - I'm going to go here and import PZ can
11:25 - and then I don't actually need all this
11:28 - then what I'm going to do is I'm going
11:30 - to say I need to create a PZ cam object
11:33 - which is a camera I'm gonna say camera
11:34 - equals a new PZ cam this so that it
11:38 - controls this sketch and 200 because I
11:40 - want to my view to be about 200 kind of
11:42 - 3d pixels away and once I do that we
11:46 - should have something that looks like
11:48 - whoops oh I now I don't need to
11:52 - translate to the middle PZ cam does that
11:54 - for me automatically and it shows
11:57 - something looks like this and we can
11:58 - rotate around we can see this is indeed
12:01 - something very spiritual I can look at
12:03 - it and rotate around and we can really
12:05 - see also by the way how this total value
12:07 - is going to affect the resolution of
12:10 - this sphere so for example if I were to
12:14 - say I just want to use 20 units for each
12:17 - latitude and longitude whoops
12:21 - run this code you can see that sphere is
12:25 - still there but you can see there's not
12:28 - as many boys this is very hard for you
12:29 - to see just for the sake of the live
12:32 - stream let me say stroke weight for
12:34 - right now so that those kind of dots
12:37 - become oh and I should probably start
12:39 - further right you can see the kind of
12:40 - resolution of this sphere as much
12:43 - smaller so to speak okay yes so um so
12:47 - Oliver's pointing something on the chat
12:48 - that it should be less than or equal to
12:50 - total I'm gonna get to that in a moment
12:53 - I'm gonna get to that in a moment that's
12:56 - going to come up as I start to add the
12:57 - triangle strips so let me leave this at
13:00 - 24 right now and let me just fix this PZ
13:05 - cam thing to start a little further away
13:08 - okay so this is real this is what I'm
13:10 - looking for I now have a sphere now
13:12 - here's the thing the sphere now is just
13:15 - dots and what I want to
13:17 - actually do come back here is to have
13:19 - each one of these dots become two
13:21 - triangular polygons you know there's a
13:24 - variety of ways I could kind of mesh
13:26 - this fear but this is an easy way and so
13:28 - what I want to do is create these
13:29 - triangle strips and I'm going to create
13:31 - them as horizontal strips so I want it
13:34 - for each time I go to a different
13:36 - latitude I want to start a new triangle
13:38 - strip and I need to say each triangle is
13:41 - one longitude value followed by another
13:46 - longitude value followed by a value that
13:50 - follows no no I think what I'm going to
13:53 - do is this yeah so I need to say one
13:56 - longitude value followed by the latitude
13:59 - below it followed by another longitude
14:01 - value there and that gives me that and
14:03 - then when I go down here it'll give me
14:05 - this I want to go there they'll give me
14:06 - this when I go down here they'll give
14:07 - you this so that's going to connect that
14:09 - whole wraparound as a bunch of triangles
14:12 - I don't know if I explain that so well
14:13 - but let me to put the chat okay are the
14:16 - comments or whatever wherever this video
14:18 - is being watched okay so first thing I
14:20 - want to look at is in order to do this
14:22 - what I actually want to do I think will
14:24 - make things simpler is calculate all of
14:26 - those vertices V X points in an array
14:29 - because I want to pre-compute the sphere
14:31 - and then draw it in a separate loop so
14:34 - that because I'm going to like be using
14:35 - different points along the sphere as I
14:36 - go so one way of doing that is to create
14:38 - a two-dimensional array so and the idea
14:42 - here is that I have a two-dimensional
14:43 - array to store the XYZ value for every
14:47 - single latitude and longitude so I'm
14:49 - going to come back over here and I'm
14:51 - going to say P vector two-dimensional
14:54 - array and I know what to comment call
14:55 - this globe and then write somewhere here
14:59 - I know I could be smart about this let
15:01 - me be smart about this and very cool
15:04 - what I do is smart
15:05 - I'm going to put the total as a global
15:06 - variable because what I'm going to do
15:09 - here is say globe is a new
15:11 - two-dimensional array and what I know it
15:16 - which has a total and total so I need 20
15:20 - columns and 20 rows essentially 20 spots
15:23 - for latitude values in 20 spots for
15:28 - longitude values whatever
15:30 - there's probably a science to this that
15:33 - often escapes me but okay so I'm doing
15:36 - that and then here instead of actually
15:37 - drawing the points I don't want to do
15:40 - that anymore what I want to do is say
15:41 - globe I is longitude so I'm going to say
15:46 - so actually I want to do this
15:48 - differently I want to do for every
15:53 - latitude do all the longitude so I'm
15:55 - actually going to change this and I'm
15:57 - going to have I refer to latitude so I
15:59 - want to swap these I think I'm doing
16:02 - this right we'll find out so I want to
16:05 - say I is like the longitude value J is
16:07 - the latitude value is a new P vector a
16:10 - vector by the way is a data structure
16:12 - that can store the x y&z components all
16:14 - together there's more to it than that I
16:16 - have plenty of other videos about P
16:18 - vector so I want to do this let me just
16:20 - run this make sure I don't have any
16:22 - errors great so now I'm going to copy
16:25 - this loop exactly and I don't need to do
16:30 - any of the calculation anymore the
16:32 - second time around all I need to do is
16:34 - say I have a p vector V which is at that
16:39 - spot and then what I want to do is draw
16:43 - the point so I just want to make sure
16:45 - the same thing works v X V Y and V Z so
16:53 - I should get the same exact thing I had
16:54 - before which it looks like I do so I
16:56 - haven't done anything new the only thing
16:58 - I've changed is that I first have a loop
17:01 - to calculate everything because all the
17:03 - sine and cosine stuff is expensive
17:04 - calculations so I don't want to do that
17:06 - multiple time so they don't have to so
17:08 - I'm going to calculate everything put it
17:10 - in this two-dimensional array and then
17:11 - use the two-dimensional array to set a
17:13 - bunch of points and now is the moment
17:16 - where instead of points I can say for
17:22 - every J I want to start a new triangle
17:28 - strip and at the end of every row or
17:33 - every kind of um every latitude I want
17:41 - to end shake and I want the verse
17:44 - to seize I want to set the vertices to
17:46 - be this vector now however I'm going to
17:48 - make this v1 because remember what I
17:50 - needed to do was I needed to say I want
17:54 - to set this point then this point then
17:59 - this point and that gives me a triangle
18:01 - then this point then this point so I
18:03 - need to skip down one so what I'm going
18:06 - to do now is say I want another vector
18:09 - v2 equals globe I plus 1j and then I
18:14 - want that to be the next vertex just by
18:20 - the way let me just comment this out and
18:22 - show you what happens I don't know if
18:24 - we're going to get anything at all we
18:25 - get just these like lines across it
18:28 - didn't actually make the triangles and I
18:29 - don't think I think we can do away with
18:31 - the stroke weight I'll leave it at two
18:33 - just so it's quite visible so you can
18:35 - see what we've got here we've got this
18:37 - sort of almost like I don't know what to
18:39 - call that like foldy pattern ii thingy
18:41 - so I need that bottom vertex I need to
18:45 - do top bottom across bottom across
18:48 - bottom across and now once I do that
18:51 - you're going to see ah okay I have an
18:53 - error I have an array index out of
18:55 - bounds there why well I'm only going
18:57 - from J to total and then I'm saying I
19:02 - plus 1 so I could say just for right now
19:04 - I'm going to say total minus 1 I mean
19:07 - for I total minus 1 ok because I didn't
19:10 - need I in the next one I in the next one
19:12 - I want to stop one early and now you can
19:16 - see I have the triangle I have that
19:18 - triangle stripped now now let's look at
19:21 - what's going on here there's like this
19:22 - whole there's like a scene here and also
19:24 - you know I didn't finish the top I think
19:27 - is missing maybe I kind of got it
19:29 - there's like there's like a bunch of
19:30 - holes so why is that well there's kind
19:33 - of a problem which is that while I'm
19:35 - going around in a whoops while I'm going
19:40 - around if it's kind of nice looking and
19:42 - look it's interesting to see how you
19:43 - could manipulate and cut holes and do
19:45 - all sorts of things but while I'm going
19:47 - around it I actually need to end up
19:49 - where I started instead of stopping at
19:51 - the last one before and so we need to
19:53 - adjust the code to really do that and
19:56 - there it one will happen to do that
19:58 - trick weights just say like well I have
19:59 - this value called total which is 20 but
20:01 - I'm actually going to make my array
20:02 - always one bigger and then I'm going to
20:05 - do less than or equal in the loop or I
20:07 - could just do less than you know it just
20:09 - for consistency this is really the same
20:11 - thing I'm going to say total plus one
20:13 - total plus one and then now with I I
20:16 - doesn't go to total minus one here I
20:18 - goes all the way to total and J goes to
20:21 - total plus one so if I run this again we
20:24 - should see here that I have the whole
20:25 - sphere now so you can see I have now
20:29 - created geometry for an entire sphere
20:31 - and there's all sorts of exciting things
20:33 - we could do all of a sudden now that
20:34 - we've done this okay hold on
20:36 - timeout let's keep going yes Rukhsar
20:39 - programming the death star in a way now
20:42 - let's do a few things I didn't notice oh
20:44 - I had a fill here I didn't realize that
20:45 - so let's do something let's just say for
20:48 - a second that I want to look at I want
20:51 - to just sort of see these as separate
20:52 - strips so what I'm going to do is I'm
20:54 - going to say I'm going to have a
20:55 - different fill here I'm going to say if
20:57 - I modulus 2 equals 0 what does that mean
21:02 - I modulus 2 equals 0 modulus is an
21:04 - operation that gives you the remainder
21:06 - of division so 2 modulus 2 is 0 3
21:10 - modulus 2 is 1 for modulus 2 is 0 5
21:13 - modules 2 is 1 so I'm saying every other
21:15 - kind of row so to speak let's say fill 0
21:19 - otherwise fill 255 and now we can see
21:24 - really that we've have these strips here
21:26 - so I have each only I didn't wait let's
21:30 - start over
21:31 - did I really do this I think I did
21:32 - something backwards because I was
21:34 - imagining my strips going across this
21:37 - way so I will look at this it doesn't
21:40 - really matter
21:43 - yeah so somebody the chat points out
21:45 - that I shouldn't be recomputing us the
21:48 - sphere over and over again and draw and
21:49 - that's absolutely true the only reason
21:52 - I'm doing that is because ultimately I'm
21:53 - going to do I'm going to animate and I'm
21:55 - going to morph the sphere and so at that
21:57 - point I'm going to need to recalculate
21:58 - the points every time so I'm setting up
21:59 - the examples that way ok so you can see
22:02 - how I can kind of alternate colors I
22:04 - could also do something like let's make
22:07 - a rainbow so I'm going to make a HSV
22:10 - color
22:11 - as the color mode and I'm going to fill
22:14 - from I'm going to say give me a hue
22:19 - value which is maps I I guess I can do
22:24 - this with J now if I want whips which
22:27 - maps J let's just try that from zero to
22:31 - total to 0 to 255 and I can say fill
22:35 - that hue with full brightness and
22:37 - saturation and now we have got a kind of
22:41 - rainbow II looking thing but you can see
22:44 - like I first of all let's take out the
22:46 - stroke let's check out the stroke just
22:49 - so we've got the colors I'm going to say
22:53 - no stroke and I'm also going to do
22:55 - something like well let's actually map
22:58 - the hue to 255 times 6 and say hue
23:03 - modulus 255 so we cycle around the
23:06 - rainbow multiple times and there we go
23:08 - and I didn't get this so I messed up
23:10 - having this line up the seams line up
23:13 - correctly I'm going to fix that in
23:14 - between this video and the next one I'm
23:16 - not going to you could fix that on your
23:17 - own as an exercise I think that's a
23:19 - couple things backwards here and there
23:21 - has I built this but you can see what
23:23 - the possibilities are
23:24 - I could also start doing things like I
23:27 - could take these each time I calculate
23:30 - the globe I could say also say I could
23:35 - make a random vector a random 3d vector
23:39 - random random 3d I could scale it by
23:44 - some amount 10 and then I could say
23:47 - globe I get J J dot add that random
23:54 - vector and if I do that you're going to
23:57 - see I now have this sort of like
23:59 - jiggling all the points are kind of
24:01 - moving randomly I could do something
24:02 - with Perlin noise you can see the
24:04 - possibilities emerging and how you
24:06 - individually color each tile and how you
24:08 - might individually move and adjust those
24:11 - points so this I think
24:13 - finishes my tutorial on sphere geometry
24:18 - and what I'm going to do in the next
24:19 - video is fix a few things here that I
24:21 - might have gotten wrong as well as move
24:23 - words how I can turn that sphere into
24:26 - generating these super shapes so right
24:29 - now I moved these points around with
24:30 - random numbers what kind of other math
24:32 - might apply to start moving the points
24:35 - around and see how that's done so thanks
24:37 - for watching this spear geometry video
24:39 - stay tuned also for I'm going to look at
24:42 - how to maybe do this with WebGL in
24:43 - JavaScript in a separate video so I've
24:45 - also got that coming as well okay see
24:47 - you soon
24:48 - hello quick epilogue addendum to that
24:51 - video there was actually a big fatal
24:53 - flaw and not so fatal actually my code
24:55 - was fine it made something interesting
24:57 - but there was a flaw where I wasn't
24:58 - getting the effect that I expected the
25:00 - effect that I expected we run this now
25:04 - is this which is actually getting nice
25:07 - perfect horizontal bands of color for
25:11 - the rainbow effect and that the reason
25:13 - why is I had in these formulas by
25:15 - accident reversed my latitude and
25:17 - longitude and we could see on the
25:19 - Wikipedia page that right here this
25:21 - theta actually refers to latitude having
25:24 - a range between zero and pi and fee fie
25:28 - foe fum the Greek letter fee as a range
25:31 - is refers to longitude or the range
25:33 - between 0 and 2pi and I also I don't
25:36 - know why I had between negative PI and
25:38 - PI and negative hat pi divided by 2 I
25:40 - now also adjusted those ranges and you
25:42 - can see the ranges are now between 0 and
25:44 - pi 0 and 2pi and have latitude and
25:46 - longitude in the right place and we can
25:48 - really see and this by the way i have
25:50 - also changed the sphere detail to 200
25:53 - the total value to 200 so you can see
25:54 - those bands are much more kind of
25:57 - nuanced and detailed if I change this
25:58 - back to something crazy like 5 you would
26:01 - see that like now this sphere has very
26:03 - sort of like strong hard geometry to it
26:05 - and would be interesting to kind of make
26:07 - that a dynamic value so you can kind of
26:08 - have this you know almost like cube
26:10 - morph into spheres so I'll let you play
26:13 - around the correct code will be posted
26:15 - hopefully you weren't like typing all
26:17 - these comments in the chat to fix it I
26:19 - think you got to the end of the video
26:20 - and realized I fix it at the end but if
26:22 - you did then that just means you're kind
26:23 - of participating in the community that
26:25 - is this world and that makes me happy so
26:27 - thanks for watching this addendum and
26:28 - who knows might actually be another
26:30 - addendum starting a moment later but I
26:32 - don't think so I think this is the last
26:33 - one goodbye
