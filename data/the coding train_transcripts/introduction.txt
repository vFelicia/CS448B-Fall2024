00:01 - Did you stick with me?
00:03 - So now you're in the first
section of the Nature of Code
00:05 - learning playlist, and that
section is the Introduction.
00:09 - So what's actually going to
happen now if you keep watching
00:11 - is the next videos that
pop up into your feed
00:14 - or videos that I've made
in the last several years
00:16 - about Perlin noise, the
history of Perlin noise,
00:20 - and something called
open simplex noise,
00:22 - as well as random walks.
00:24 - So this is really just
meant to be a warm up,
00:26 - a way to dip your
toe into the water.
00:28 - Maybe you haven't programmed
in P5 JS with JavaScript
00:31 - or object-oriented
programming in a while,
00:33 - and so this will get you
a little bit of a warm
00:35 - up before I move on to
the next chapter, vectors.
00:39 - So that's where I will be
where-- in vectors, I'll
00:42 - be wearing these clothes,
because at this moment right
00:44 - now, I am-- recordings
that I'm going to next,
00:46 - they'll talk about vectors.
00:47 - But before I-- before
you see me then, oh--
00:50 - Nature of Code is
really disrupting
00:51 - the space-time continuum.
00:53 - Before you see those,
you'll see a bunch
00:54 - of videos about Perlin
noise and random walks which
00:59 - you can draw upon, I think,
as a starting point for how
01:02 - you might want to start
working with vectors.
