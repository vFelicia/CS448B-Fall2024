00:00 - hello and welcome to a coding challenge
00:02 - which I'm going to call blobby coding
00:04 - challenge I want to make something
00:05 - that's a blob this is a this is sort of
00:08 - loosely a part of the agario coding
00:10 - challenges where there are these
00:11 - circular things moving around the screen
00:13 - but I'm in this coding challenge only
00:15 - thinking about just that sort of
00:16 - stationary circle which is a nice
00:18 - perfectly round beautiful happy little
00:20 - circle right there but I want it to be
00:22 - wavy curvy and the edges and kind of
00:24 - feel a little blobby so let's think
00:26 - about men come over the whiteboard here
00:27 - and draw some stuff right this is a
00:30 - perfect circle which is drawn as an
00:33 - ellipse but another way I could draw
00:36 - this perfect circle is by using a call
00:39 - to a function called begin shape and a
00:42 - call to a function called end shape and
00:45 - in between there I could make a lot of
00:48 - calls to a function called vertex so if
00:51 - I were to say put a vertex here put a
00:54 - vertex here put a vertex here vertex
00:55 - vertex vertex and connect them all then
00:59 - I have what I started with a nice
01:01 - perfect circle but what if I were to
01:04 - make this vertex go out over here and
01:06 - this one come in over here then I might
01:09 - have something that appears kind of
01:10 - curvy and what if these wiggle all
01:12 - around and kind of blob around then I
01:15 - have something that appears kind of
01:16 - squishy and blobby now there are a
01:18 - couple different ways I could do this
01:19 - option number one I could do some kind
01:22 - of physics simulation with a lot of
01:24 - springy forces I have this like almost
01:26 - as if these are all connected by Springs
01:29 - and as you pull one it pulls the other
01:31 - and kind of flips back and oscillates
01:33 - and jiggles and that sort of thing come
01:34 - and do that in another coding challenge
01:36 - you can take a look at one of my toxic
01:38 - libs kind of like cloth simulations to
01:42 - get an idea of how you might do that
01:43 - another way I could do this is with
01:45 - Perlin noise and I think I'm going to
01:47 - try that right now or I could use like a
01:49 - sine wave in other words all I want to
01:51 - do is alter this radius right each of
01:55 - these points is calculated based on an
01:57 - angle which I'll call theta and a radius
01:59 - if I iterate over all the different
02:01 - angles but change the radius and have
02:04 - those rate radii move move up and down
02:06 - randomly I can get something that seems
02:08 - kind of squishing and blobby so let's
02:10 - see if we can make that happen
02:11 - the first thing I want to do is go into
02:14 - the blob object and find this show
02:17 - function which is right down here and
02:19 - you can see what's happening here I'm
02:21 - drawing an ellipse but I'm going to
02:24 - change that now and I'm going to do a
02:27 - couple things one is I'm going to say
02:29 - push and pop because I'm going to also
02:33 - use translate because I want to first
02:36 - translate to the center of this object
02:38 - and then once I've done that I can say
02:41 - begin shape and I can say end shape and
02:45 - then I can have a loop so what do I want
02:48 - my loop to do I want an angle to start
02:51 - at zero and I want to go all the way to
02:53 - two how do you spell 2pi and i want to
02:57 - go up by some amount I'm going to say
02:59 - 0.1 and I really should be more
03:01 - thoughtful about this but I'm just going
03:03 - to randomly do this and then I'm going
03:05 - to say I have an X which is now this
03:09 - object's radius times cosine of that
03:13 - angle this is a polar to Cartesian
03:15 - conversion which I would refer you to
03:17 - another video where I go through this
03:18 - math and a bit more detail but now I can
03:21 - just set the vertex to that x and y
03:23 - position so let's run this and see if we
03:26 - get basically the same result I find it
03:30 - hard to believe that that's really what
03:33 - happened am I looking at the correct
03:35 - code let me comment that out
03:36 - okay it's not there shockingly that
03:39 - looks way too similar I guess that'd
03:43 - work
03:44 - oh you can see that it actually changed
03:45 - because it's not so perfect there on the
03:47 - right let's let's just to see see how
03:52 - this is actually working let's draw
03:54 - little ellipses and take out the
03:56 - vertices right you can see that's what
03:59 - I've actually done I've drawn all these
04:00 - little circles and connected them so
04:03 - there we go
04:03 - so this actually worked the thing is I
04:05 - want this variable this R to be
04:09 - something that changes so what if I said
04:11 - R equals this dot R plus a random amount
04:15 - between negative 5 and 5 and so on I
04:19 - used R instead what would we get now
04:24 - we would get something that looks like
04:26 - this you can see those radii are
04:28 - changing what if I did something where I
04:30 - said I want to have an offset which
04:35 - equals map sine of the angle which goes
04:40 - with a negative and 1 and 1/2 negative 5
04:42 - and 5 and what if I say angle plus frame
04:45 - count times 0.01 or something so and so
04:51 - this is now this dot R plus offset that
04:56 - didn't do very much oh you know I just
05:04 - realized uh yeah that's just moving all
05:10 - the vertices together with the same
05:13 - offset so they have to be offset from
05:14 - each other anyway the point of what I
05:16 - want to do is not that actually I want
05:20 - to make this assign this sine wave thing
05:22 - work ok what I want is for each one I
05:25 - want to do I want to get this to work
05:27 - let's make this actually work I want it
05:29 - to do this I want you to just see what
05:31 - it looks like when there's a sine wave
05:32 - so I want to have this I need a separate
05:37 - value that's that really should work or
05:41 - I guess maybe these angles aren't are
05:42 - changing by too much hold on let's let's
05:46 - make this work right do I need to
05:48 - multiply this by like some tiny amount
05:50 - or something um I'm back whoops oh I'm
06:01 - back so actually the the angles I've
06:03 - just forgot are only between 0 and 2pi
06:05 - so there's only one cycle of the sine
06:07 - wave so I actually want to multiply the
06:09 - angle by a lot if I want to see that
06:12 - sort of oscillation so I I can get
06:14 - something kind of like this and you know
06:17 - I could play around with these you know
06:22 - values anyway you could you could get
06:24 - the idea of how I might not good off you
06:26 - could get the idea of how I can do
06:27 - various kinds of different offsets to
06:30 - change the quality of that shape but
06:32 - let's actually just use Perlin noise
06:33 - which I think will produce some
06:35 - interesting results so
06:37 - what if I were to say noise and I want
06:42 - to have an X offset which I'll say
06:45 - equals zero noise of X offset which goes
06:50 - between zero and one and I want to map
06:53 - that between negative twenty five and
06:55 - twenty five and I want that X offset to
06:59 - increase by some amount for each one of
07:02 - those so if we see that you can see now
07:03 - I have this kind of blobby looking thing
07:05 - and each time i refresh it looks a
07:08 - little stranger now you'll notice I have
07:09 - an issue where I'm not able to connect
07:11 - the last point to the first point very
07:13 - well and there's ways we can kind of
07:15 - improve that but you can see I've got
07:17 - like this kind of goofy-looking shape
07:19 - now what I can actually do there's a
07:22 - couple things I could do
07:23 - number one is I could add a Y offset and
07:26 - the y offset is kind of like a global
07:31 - variable for this object it could start
07:33 - it it could start at zero itself and and
07:38 - the y offset is the thing that doesn't
07:41 - change for each one but just changes
07:42 - over time itself so if I use two
07:44 - dimensional Perlin noise now you're
07:47 - going to see this kind of like blobby of
07:49 - shape now the Y offset is changing
07:50 - rather fast so I might want to slow that
07:53 - down quite a bit and you can see now
07:55 - I've got some a more undulating like
07:57 - type thing I could have also by the way
08:00 - just not used to dimensional noise but I
08:04 - could have just I could just say X
08:06 - offset plus Y offset and you'll see this
08:08 - is doing something this looks like it's
08:10 - actually kind of like spinning because
08:12 - the noise IDs are actually kind of
08:13 - rotating around so that's another effect
08:15 - that you can kind of get by just like
08:17 - changing where the noise is beginning
08:19 - and even this like this doesn't bother
08:21 - me so much but you could consider using
08:23 - something like this in agario to make it
08:25 - kind of a little bit squishier and in
08:28 - that sort of thing so this account gets
08:30 - you the basic idea of having a bit of a
08:33 - Perlin noise ball so to speak I think
08:35 - what I'll do hopefully remind me in the
08:36 - comments is when I publish this code I
08:39 - might simplify this even further to just
08:41 - have that kind of shape thing and you
08:43 - can kind of tweak it let's think about
08:45 - and about improvements that we could
08:47 - make to to tie the last point
08:50 - to the first point itself okay so thanks
08:54 - for watching this right at some point
08:56 - I'd like to show you how to add some
08:57 - spring forces to this which would be
08:58 - another another nice kind of quality to
09:01 - it as well okay thanks for watching this
09:03 - coding challenge and I'll see you again
09:04 - in a future video
