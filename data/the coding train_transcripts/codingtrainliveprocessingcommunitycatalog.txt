00:50 - [Music]
01:01 - [Music]

01:36 - [Music]
02:01 - do
02:03 - [Music]
02:22 - good morning uh sound check um
02:25 - hopefully there will be much less
02:27 - technical fail than last week let me
02:29 - know how the volume of my voice is as
02:31 - compared to the music
02:33 - and i will be getting started in about
02:35 - two and a half minutes i'm also curious
02:37 - uh i'm reading the chat right now um if
02:40 - how is the echo of the audio i've
02:43 - i've had i have sound blankets foam but
02:46 - i'm not fully set up yet here
02:48 - so but you know just let me know the
02:50 - sound quality okay
02:54 - uh muting myself again getting started
02:56 - in about two minutes to three minutes
03:02 - [Music]
03:10 - do
03:12 - [Music]
03:24 - do
03:26 - [Music]
03:32 - all right the feedback came in my volume
03:34 - was a little bit low
03:36 - it's going into the red now on my
03:38 - dashboard so i think what i'm going to
03:40 - do actually is just turn the music down
03:42 - the music is getting lower
03:44 - and then i'm going to keep my voice down
03:46 - to here because when i start when i'm
03:49 - streaming i start to get quite animated
03:50 - oh now it's quite low okay here we go
03:52 - moving it up a little bit this should be
03:54 - good i think we're at a good place right
03:56 - now
03:57 - uh it is kind of going in the red when i
03:59 - get excited but you let me know
04:02 - okay everybody
04:10 - [Music]
04:25 - [Music]
04:36 - do
04:47 - [Music]
05:01 - do
05:07 - [Music]
05:31 - [Music]
06:05 - [Music]
06:26 - all aboard
06:28 - the train is coming into the station
06:31 - it is me i am streaming i see a green
06:34 - light over there i see a camera there i
06:36 - see a brand new bright light shining in
06:38 - my face over here it is friday morning
06:41 - the weekend is upon us it is a beautiful
06:43 - day here in the hudson valley of new
06:45 - york state where i am in a brand new
06:48 - well it's not so new this building that
06:50 - i'm in this garage was built in the
06:51 - 1940s but this studio that i'm setting
06:53 - up here is very very new and in fact
06:56 - uh well i've had so many so much
06:58 - technical difficulty um oh first of all
07:02 - can you hear that
07:06 - look at my mic
07:11 - i'm just wondering if you're hearing
07:12 - something i don't want to talk about
07:14 - what it is until i know that you're
07:16 - hearing it let me open up the chat here
07:18 - i have a new
07:19 - uh extra panel um that i can use to draw
07:23 - things um and et cetera et cetera all
07:25 - right the ipad is new and yes the ipad
07:27 - would be used for drawing aha so you
07:29 - think
07:31 - but i have something else that is new
07:33 - and set up not the final version of it
07:36 - no no not this sound effect
07:38 - so like not set up here
07:40 - i have
07:42 - you can hear multiple instances of my
07:44 - voice
07:45 - okay hold on i
07:47 - this is no
07:49 - i know this can happen
07:51 - but i don't think it's the issue that i
07:53 - think that it was
07:55 - um all right but okay wait uh drum roll
07:58 - please
08:00 - the drum roll sound have a bad feeling
08:02 - it's gonna completely disappear when i
08:03 - switch the camera view but i'm gonna
08:05 - press a button over here and
08:10 - i don't know if you can still hear the
08:11 - drum roll or still hear me but here i am
08:14 - over at my new
08:17 - uh oh that white board oh it's i put
08:20 - this together myself and i think it's
08:22 - it's a little wonky
08:24 - um i don't know that i'm gonna use it
08:26 - today um this is uh
08:29 - oh and i have a light here that i could
08:30 - have turned on point i have no lights
08:32 - over here i have another light that i
08:33 - purchased
08:35 - um and um i have this light stand
08:39 - here
08:40 - that has no light attached to it
08:42 - these are actually these wonderful i
08:44 - mean this is not a sponsor or anything
08:46 - but
08:47 - this is a uh this was recommended to me
08:49 - by
08:50 - folks at um standard uh
08:53 - youtuber
08:54 - agency
08:55 - group folks thing that i'm a part of uh
08:57 - runs nebula watch nebula um rx24 tdx
09:01 - roll flex led light i've got a stand and
09:03 - a thing so i got to get that set up over
09:05 - here i'm also planning to get a second
09:06 - camera what you're currently seeing now
09:09 - uh is i'm just making sure my audio is
09:11 - on because i cannot see the chat or
09:13 - anything from where i am what you're
09:14 - currently seeing now is um just my phone
09:17 - which actually is not the worst quality
09:19 - in the world
09:20 - and
09:21 - i'm just going to try drawing one of my
09:23 - typical diagrams
09:25 - of like oh i have a vehicle it has a
09:27 - velocity there's like a target so now we
09:30 - have a
09:31 - desired velocity
09:33 - so it's my intention as much as i do
09:35 - have an ipad with drawing apps and i may
09:37 - use that
09:38 - i just find that having a physical
09:40 - whiteboard
09:41 - just works better for me
09:43 - and has so many affordances in terms of
09:45 - gesture and
09:47 - that sort of thing i do have dreams
09:49 - though of getting one of those digital
09:51 - whiteboards like there's the google
09:52 - jamboard
09:54 - um
09:55 - which would allow me to have maybe the
09:56 - best of both worlds
09:58 - so we'll see to be determined um but i
10:01 - need another camera uh i need to set up
10:05 - the light
10:06 - i've got a new streaming computer
10:10 - arriving it's uh hopefully
10:14 - it is arriving where is my button here
10:17 - so right now there is a
10:19 - small nice little windows pc
10:22 - to my left
10:23 - it is broadcasting
10:25 - um over the internet to you
10:29 - what am i even talking about
10:31 - but it doesn't have a capture card it
10:33 - doesn't have a very good graphics card i
10:35 - have purchased a brand new streaming
10:38 - computer it's got a capture card it's
10:40 - got a
10:41 - uh
10:42 - nvidia
10:44 - 8
10:45 - 3080
10:47 - something magic graphics card thing it's
10:49 - gonna be awesome and supposedly it's
10:51 - coming on october 5th so i got to get
10:53 - that set up it's going to allow me to
10:55 - hopefully do a have better quality
10:56 - streaming more uh you know
10:59 - more inputs i don't have currently have
11:00 - like there's no way for me to have a
11:01 - second camera because i don't have
11:02 - another
11:03 - like i have these like usb capture boxes
11:06 - things so i'm gonna have so much more
11:08 - by the way this is like an awesome segue
11:10 - to
11:11 - coding train today and all this stuff is
11:13 - very expensive
11:14 - is uh sponsored by brilliant oh thank
11:17 - you brilliant i'm working on this new
11:19 - studio no thank you to you and also to
11:22 - the viewers who then go and choose to
11:24 - sign up for free at brilliant.org
11:27 - codingtrain the banner right up there um
11:29 - if you like learning and watching video
11:31 - channels like the coding train to learn
11:33 - about code and math and science and
11:36 - physics as part of science and all of
11:38 - that stuff you will also love brilliant
11:40 - a website an app so many um interactive
11:44 - lessons and exercises and daily
11:45 - challenges
11:47 - there's a course on learning python
11:48 - there's a course on learning neural
11:50 - networks these are the ones that i
11:51 - generally plug because they're excellent
11:52 - i was just looking at the neural
11:54 - networks course for my class that i'm
11:56 - teaching on machine learning so it
11:59 - really helps me thank you again
12:00 - brilliant uh it is brilliant and um all
12:03 - sorts of wonderful stuff so i'll come
12:04 - back when i what i think the last time

12:10 - brilliant and kind of pull the audience
12:11 - and work through this i'll come back and
12:12 - do that later but right now i would
12:14 - encourage you you can sign up for free
12:16 - at brilliant.org codingtrain if you want

12:24 - that link will get 20 off of the premium
12:26 - subscription okay
12:29 - now back to our regularly scheduled
12:31 - programming
12:32 - welcome my name is dan i tend to i i
12:35 - have this thing it's a youtube channel
12:37 - it is called a coding train
12:39 - and i like to program on it and make do
12:41 - lessons about coding and interact with
12:44 - the viewers and have fun and
12:47 - mess up and show you that programming is
12:50 - can be creative enjoyable
12:53 - difficult frustrating uh all of the
12:56 - above emotions the whole range what are
12:58 - the like twelves
12:59 - the the nine stages of programming i
13:02 - don't know some well we'll work that out
13:03 - later
13:04 - if this is your first time watching
13:07 - thank you uh hello how are you is

13:12 - here for you in this small internet way
13:15 - the best that i can be um
13:17 - things are a little bit rough right now
13:19 - rough around the edges new setup new
13:22 - commute to my day job teaching at nyu
13:25 - less time for the coding train oh i hear
13:27 - it in the comments so much i missed the
13:28 - coding challenges where are the coding
13:29 - challenges how many don't do coding
13:30 - challenges i hear you i'm going to find
13:33 - my way back to them somehow uh things
13:35 - will change um in the new year 2022 next
13:38 - year um i currently am teaching three
13:42 - classes which is a tremendous amount of
13:45 - time and work
13:46 - gloria
13:48 - my dog is uh enjoying being here upstate
13:51 - in the hudson valley she is sitting in
13:52 - the sun over there in the grass that you
13:54 - can't see need to get a dog cam going
13:57 - um
13:58 - but i will um i have a sabbatical
14:01 - semester this spring and one of the
14:03 - reasons why i'm up here and setting this
14:04 - up so hopefully there'll be a lot more
14:06 - stuff to come in 2022 so bear with me
14:09 - thank you to all those of you who are
14:10 - supporting through the coding train
14:12 - membership program where you get some
14:14 - stickers and various things
14:16 - uh but i know uh things are a little
14:19 - wonky a little bit light i i tried in
14:21 - the past somehow i made this all work
14:23 - well in the past
14:24 - i don't know where where my past self
14:26 - went
14:27 - my my rhythm of the week was always one
14:30 - day recording tutorials one day live
14:33 - streaming and i can't seem to fit both
14:35 - of those in right now so here i am i'm
14:37 - definitely live streaming today i'm
14:38 - going to try to live stream it's either
14:40 - going to be on mondays or fridays i
14:42 - think fridays is kind of a better day
14:44 - for you the viewer monday might turn out
14:45 - to be a better day for me this the
14:47 - streamer
14:48 - so we'll see stay tuned but hopefully
14:50 - i'm going to be at least
14:52 - uh every week missing you know you know
14:55 - thanksgiving the hallet holiday week
14:57 - i'll probably miss and here and there
14:59 - um some other things here and there so
15:01 - i've got some other family commitments
15:02 - and stuff so um the video recorded video
15:05 - tutorials are a little bit going to be
15:07 - slow there's some new ones coming out on
15:09 - path following vehicles path following
15:12 - chapter six of the nature of code one of
15:14 - them is like completely ready to go i
15:16 - just have to press some buttons get it
15:17 - out there
15:18 - uh the dot product how to find the angle
15:22 - between two vectors what is scalar
15:24 - projection and you might be saying i've
15:25 - already watched your video on that yes i
15:27 - made video on that probably eight years
15:29 - ago so this is an update updated version
15:31 - with you know little animations and
15:33 - better quality uh production values and
15:35 - that sort of thing
15:37 - looking at the chat barrick is saying i
15:39 - asked a question a few moments ago but
15:40 - still no answer so i have the chat both
15:43 - right over here i have the chat over
15:45 - here on different monitors i'm also
15:48 - looking at the uh the discord live chat
15:51 - for members
15:52 - um but it's very hard for me to do you
15:55 - know there's nobody else here but me i
15:56 - mean i've got gloria gloria
15:59 - do you hear that sound
16:04 - okay happen again while i'm not talking
16:08 - i hear it and i stop talking and it
16:10 - won't happen again i really want to know
16:11 - if you hear it
16:18 - anyway
16:20 - gloria's not much help when it comes to
16:21 - producing this show she's a wonderful
16:24 - she's my uh my love my emotional support
16:27 - dog i mean she's not officially that but
16:29 - it truly works in that way
16:31 - um
16:32 - and uh
16:33 - yeah but it's just me so i can't really
16:35 - like uh i can't really follow all the
16:37 - chats and everything going on i'm going
16:39 - to get better at it i've been doing this
16:40 - for years so i don't know what's what's
16:42 - taking me so long but i think as i get
16:45 - used to this new studio
16:47 - and get a little bit better into the
16:49 - rhythm of things i'll figure out stuff
16:51 - so my most live streams will include the
16:53 - goal of my live live streams
16:56 - is to engage with the community
16:58 - so to look at your contributions to the
17:00 - website um i like to go through like a
17:03 - recent video and read through some
17:04 - comments and reflect on those i'm not
17:07 - going to be doing as much of that today
17:09 - i mean and then you might be saying like
17:11 - oh great i mean you're actually going to
17:12 - do some coding instead of just like
17:14 - wasting a lot of time
17:17 - not so sure about that um but uh what i
17:20 - will be doing is today is the actually
17:24 - don't don't read this tweet literally
17:26 - anymore because this tweet was from
17:27 - several days ago today is the last day
17:30 - to submit a page to the processing
17:32 - community catalog
17:33 - oh no no oh oh the camera's not plugged
17:37 - in to power oh i knew i forgot something
17:42 - sorry everybody okay don't worry
17:44 - uh where is that plug
17:47 - oh my god
17:48 - are you kidding me
17:50 - you're kidding me okay
17:53 - ah i must have like taken it to plug
17:56 - something else in
17:57 - please bear with me oh we were we were
18:00 - so close i have so many cables aha
18:02 - here's one
18:04 - this is the cable i need i can't show it
18:06 - to you
18:06 - and i think i can actually just oh is it
18:09 - going to reach
18:11 - so don't worry this is not this is just
18:13 - because the camera it was uh running off
18:16 - its battery
18:17 - and now i am going to plug it in
18:20 - so i don't look plug come on go in there
18:22 - uh let's see a little light come on are
18:24 - you charging you're charging
18:27 - uh let's see if i can turn you off and
18:30 - back on again i'm gonna count ten
18:32 - nine
18:33 - eight
18:34 - seven come on build your charge up six
18:36 - five four three two one
18:41 - you all hear that sound
18:45 - okay camera's back
18:48 - oh
18:49 - or
18:51 - oh yeah that's back okay
18:54 - uh let's see make sure it's back okay
18:56 - it's back
18:57 - what where was i where was i you say i
19:01 - uh remember i was reading this
19:03 - um share a photo of work a snippet of
19:06 - code a screenshot of a webpage you made
19:08 - or anything else we want to include you
19:10 - in this publication so
19:11 - um
19:13 - processing foundation is an organization
19:15 - near and dear to my heart um processing
19:18 - foundation uh maintains
19:21 - uh a lot of the uh
19:23 - pretty much all of the coding platforms
19:25 - that i use on this channel uh processing
19:27 - p5 it was the 20th anniversary of
19:30 - processing
19:31 - uh the software itself
19:32 - and this is the community catalog so i'm
19:34 - going to click here on more information
19:36 - here
19:37 - and so the idea is to make a community
19:40 - catalog to celebrate all we've done
19:42 - together with processing for the last 20
19:45 - years
19:46 - i
19:48 - would like to say that i'm not a
19:49 - procrastinator but with certain things i
19:52 - absolutely am
19:53 - submissions are due by 11 59 pacific
19:56 - time oh pacific time oh wow i got till
19:59 - i'm on eastern time i got a whole extra
20:01 - three hours
20:02 - uh on friday october 1st 2021
20:07 - so these are the specifications
20:10 - i can submit a tiff or a pdf
20:15 - tiffs should be this resolution
20:17 - grayscale
20:19 - i can use this google form
20:20 - i can email it
20:22 - i can put more information
20:24 - i can use a language that's not english
20:26 - i can contribute more than one page if
20:28 - one is for a group project or
20:30 - organization hey coding train is kind of
20:31 - an organization it could be multiple
20:33 - pages i kind of would like to just do
20:34 - one page
20:35 - uh this is only about processing what
20:37 - about p5.js it's a celebration of
20:39 - everything related to the processing
20:40 - foundation including processing p5 and
20:41 - all the other initiatives with python
20:43 - ruby as well as related advocacy work
20:45 - so
20:46 - um oh and i see computational mama is in
20:49 - the chat processing fellow and a fellow
20:53 - streamer and educator
20:56 - everyone should check out big shout out
20:58 - to computational mama everyone should
21:00 - check out oh no no no no no the camera
21:04 - i think it just needs to build up a
21:05 - little bit more of a charge
21:07 - oh my gosh why did i not have it plugged
21:09 - in all morning
21:10 - uh all right here i'm turning this
21:12 - camera on this is gonna be interesting
21:14 - uh i'll just come talk to you for a
21:16 - little bit so here's so i'm over here so
21:19 - the problem is now i can't see the chat
21:20 - i want to make a brainstorming list well
21:22 - i'm going to talk through some of my
21:24 - ideas
21:27 - uh okay
21:29 - you see how this like shakes as i erase
21:31 - it i think maybe i didn't put it
21:33 - together like well this is kind of a
21:34 - cheapy white board okay here's the
21:36 - here's something you'd do to help me i
21:38 - would in bed i would you know i've
21:39 - invested a significant amount into the
21:42 - streaming computer i'm going to get i
21:44 - could repurpose this whiteboard just to
21:46 - be like an extra
21:47 - like whiteboard for my own notes it does
21:50 - have the a nice added benefit of being
21:52 - able to flip over but it's not
21:54 - i might need i mean i got to figure out
21:56 - how to light it and get a different
21:58 - camera
21:59 - and i've already lost my marker oh here
22:01 - it is um so hold on i'm just going to
22:03 - turn this other camera off
22:07 - and let it kind of build up a charge i
22:09 - guess
22:10 - i mean it is plugged in right yep the
22:12 - light's on
22:14 - okay so i'm coming back over here so um
22:17 - i want to figure out
22:20 - what is it
22:22 - that i would like to contribute i mean
22:24 - am i making a personal contribution me
22:27 - daniel shiffman my 20 years with
22:29 - processing which has had not 20 years
22:31 - you know i started working with
22:32 - processing in 2003. so i'm close i'm
22:34 - pretty darn close i'm back there with
22:36 - the old timers
22:38 - but not the full 20 years um
22:41 - um so but i think i would like to make a
22:44 - page that's really just from the coding
22:46 - train
22:47 - um and i would like it to be
22:49 - representative of the community you the
22:51 - folks that are watching i'm checking to
22:53 - make sure my audio is going so some
22:54 - ideas that i have is
22:57 - our
22:59 - thumbnail see it shakes while i draw
23:02 - that's going to drive me completely
23:04 - bonkers
23:06 - i have no idea how the picture quality
23:08 - is and all of that there's no lighting
23:10 - this is just my phone and a whiteboard
23:12 - uh at some point i will properly light
23:15 - this area with a nicer camera i mean the
23:18 - quality is actually quite good
23:20 - um but i would love any suggestions for
23:22 - like a really nice solid high quality
23:24 - maybe matte finish is there such thing
23:26 - as a matte finish white board that
23:28 - doesn't reflect so much i guess i could
23:30 - get one of those glass things and then
23:31 - reverse the camera i don't know
23:33 - you tell me thumbnail collage
23:37 - so i could do this i could try working
23:39 - on today like some type of script that
23:41 - just like sucks all of the thumbnails
23:43 - from maybe all the coding challenges or
23:44 - all the p5 tutorials something like that
23:46 - make a collage of those that's a
23:48 - possibility um another would be just a
23:52 - collage of sketches
23:56 - i mean i would so it could be just all
23:58 - my whole set of example sketch sketches
24:01 - make a collage of them um i would love
24:03 - to add the coding train characters
24:05 - somehow boy uh jason you're not watching
24:08 - this right now but jason eggman who does
24:11 - i mean first of all he's on the west
24:12 - coast it's probably too early but um
24:15 - somebody pinged jason with the discord
24:18 - tell him oh i forgot to mention this to
24:20 - him it's due today
24:22 - but um i mean i can figure this out
24:24 - myself but um it might be nice to
24:26 - include like some of the coding trained
24:27 - characters on this page so i could talk
24:29 - to jason about getting a little design
24:30 - help so let me make a note of that uh
24:33 - coding train characters
24:35 - oh god this this is not gonna do this
24:38 - shaking white board's not gonna do i
24:39 - have i i only have tissues
24:42 - so that's not really a great solution
24:44 - for erasing okay collage of sketches now
24:47 - these could be
24:49 - community contributions
24:53 - also
24:54 - you know uh
24:55 - you know i'm a little bit last minute
24:57 - here so if i had been more thoughtful
24:59 - and prepared i would have said like hey
25:00 - a month ago putting out a call recording
25:03 - trades the community contributions to go
25:05 - on the coding trade page but yeah but
25:07 - maybe we can work that out today i can't
25:08 - see the chat so you have all these ideas
25:10 - now you're telling me i'm sorry i can't
25:12 - see them
25:13 - i'm gonna come look i do see that
25:14 - there's like either a super chat you
25:16 - could see a big blue bar over there on
25:17 - my monitor um
25:21 - so i need so that's another mental note
25:22 - i guess i'm going to maybe i need a
25:24 - secondary screen to be able to monitor
25:27 - the chat while i'm i could actually have
25:28 - a table right here
25:30 - put another screen there so while i'm at
25:32 - the whiteboard because i'm quite far
25:33 - away from the
25:35 - monitor that i look at while i'm at the
25:37 - computer um and then uh your idea is
25:39 - here so i'm gonna go look now into the
25:42 - chat and uh hopefully the cameras had a
25:44 - chance to like
25:46 - get a little bit of a charge going
25:48 - so i could turn it back on um and then
25:51 - maybe we'll do a poll and see if folks
25:54 - have thoughts or ideas about what and
25:56 - i'm not intending necessary to finish
25:57 - the community the the point of today is
25:59 - a couple things one
26:02 - i want to encourage you to submit your
26:04 - own contribution so i'm just doing some
26:06 - outreach here hey you should make one
26:08 - you got today you you love processing
26:10 - you've worked with processing and all of
26:12 - the related tools make something
26:14 - contribute yourself to the community
26:17 - catalog that's number one number two i
26:19 - would like to contribute something i
26:20 - have not gotten it together to do so
26:23 - what can i get started with during this
26:25 - live stream i gotta wrap up around 12
26:27 - 12 30 my time
26:29 - um so and then what could i reasonably
26:31 - finish off later today to the extent
26:33 - that i have a little bit of time i've
26:34 - got a lot going on i got to pick up my
26:35 - kids from school gotta cook them dinner
26:38 - there's a lot of stuff happening today
26:40 - i'm uh solo parenting uh for this
26:43 - weekend my wife is uh traveling so uh
26:47 - things are there's a lot going on
26:49 - oh i have meetings work meetings and
26:51 - there's zoom nyu that i think i'm going
26:53 - to participate in i probably have a long
26:54 - to-do list you don't need to worry about
26:56 - this i'm going to be fine i i've got
26:58 - this beautiful garage it's actually got
27:00 - um i really want to show you more about
27:02 - the garage but i can't right now it's
27:03 - actually a heated garage
27:06 - the heater is not on
27:08 - the boiler comes on every once in a
27:09 - while because it's like one of those um
27:10 - just in time it's like an old boiler at
27:12 - this i'm like learning about all this
27:14 - stuff
27:15 - you know this is not this is not
27:17 - important let me i'm i'm stalling
27:19 - because i want the camera to develop a
27:22 - charge i'm going back to the main camera
27:24 - uh hopefully um this is all still
27:27 - working
27:28 - i'm gonna i'm gonna turn this camera
27:29 - back on
27:31 - and
27:32 - hopefully i really don't think this is
27:35 - the overheating issue it is very cool in
27:37 - here right now i think it's just that it
27:39 - was not plugged in
27:40 - so i'm looking to see it is on yeah it
27:44 - it does say it's plugged since the
27:45 - battery is dead but it is plugged in
27:49 - oh there's no light
27:51 - wait a second
27:55 - it does say that it's plugged in though
27:56 - well no i'm unplugging it gets unplugged
28:00 - plugging it in okay it says it's plugged
28:02 - in
28:02 - usually there's a light on when the
28:04 - battery's charging
28:06 - but
28:06 - you know
28:09 - let's just see how it goes um i can
28:11 - always stream with you know just my
28:12 - voice um all right here we come back
28:15 - to here here i am uh let me take a look
28:19 - at the chat so i don't know
28:21 - i'm going to kind of scroll through the
28:23 - chat thank you oliver for your kind
28:26 - um
28:27 - message i'm going to scroll through the
28:30 - chat here and see
28:31 - um
28:33 - camera went out do we have to make code
28:35 - from processing or can we do it in p5
28:37 - says nurage um you know any
28:40 - processing rp5
28:42 - um text is readable glass in reverse is
28:46 - very cool those glass things are oh
28:48 - everyone's telling me i actually got one
28:49 - of those glass things
28:50 - light it from the side might work or
28:52 - even above yes
28:54 - um
28:55 - collage of all your video thumbnails
28:57 - okay great make a text writing
28:59 - processing or coding train with your
29:01 - thumbnails
29:02 - i'm trying to understand what that means
29:03 - instead of collage
29:06 - ah oh like what if we did i i think dusk
29:09 - had this idea in the discord which was
29:11 - like a um
29:13 - photo mosaic
29:14 - so kind of oh i could make like the p5 i
29:17 - could i could make a page that says p5
29:20 - and kind of out of all of the coding
29:22 - train thumbnails oh this is interesting
29:24 - let's see if i can get that to work
29:26 - letting a whiteboard and avoiding glare
29:28 - is tricky says will yes
29:30 - ascii art with random numbers that's a
29:32 - good idea also
29:35 - um
29:36 - image to submit i'm working on one
29:38 - project stuck with a problem
29:40 - so cornell is asking about csv files
29:42 - they can't can't really go right now i
29:44 - think it's not the best time for me to
29:46 - answer coding questions i'm trying to
29:47 - think though
29:48 - join the discord that's my plug
29:51 - oh and i have another thing that i need
29:52 - to talk about oh i won't be able to log
29:54 - into the discord oh blah
29:56 - um you know what i think maybe i don't
29:58 - need all right
30:00 - i got a lot of stuff going on in my head
30:02 - as you can see
30:03 - um
30:07 - uh
30:08 - your orioles are killing my playoff
30:10 - hopes for the red sox look look
30:13 - no one is allowed to complain that the
30:15 - orioles are messing up some other team
30:18 - what is the memorial's record what do
30:19 - they want like
30:20 - 20 one out of five games seems like the
30:23 - worst team in baseball but i'm gonna
30:25 - wear this hat and when the orioles win
30:26 - the world series sometime hopefully in
30:29 - my lifetime
30:31 - you'll all remember that i was wearing
30:32 - this hat all along ever since i was a
30:34 - young a young lad
30:36 - what is the task here dan all right so
30:39 - let's just start
30:41 - um le i'm going to put up a quick poll
30:44 - i've got a couple ideas here where can i
30:46 - do this
30:47 - um am i no i'm i'm who am i here hi
30:52 - that's me i'm logged in as myself but
30:54 - not as coding train
30:56 - uh
30:59 - um all right so can i do this over here
31:02 - how do i start a poll yes sorry i this
31:04 - is awkward i need a better way
31:06 - to uh set up polls
31:09 - through and of course i know i know i
31:11 - have the whole live poll node app that
31:14 - so many people put so much time in but
31:16 - now you just put a poll right in the
31:17 - chat it's a bit easier
31:20 - okay so i'm gonna uh create a poll
31:22 - uh i i think the collage is kind of the
31:25 - idea
31:26 - so
31:27 - collage of all right like so let's just
31:31 - start this way um
31:33 - uh coding train
31:35 - processing
31:37 - catalog page so what are my what are we
31:40 - voting on
31:41 - one possibility is
31:43 - uh the
31:45 - collage of thumbnails
31:49 - i
31:50 - i think this poll is kind of pointless
31:51 - because i think it's kind of coming into
31:52 - my head what makes sense to do
31:55 - another one was cl
31:57 - so this is not so great because i'm
31:59 - gonna i'm almost gonna consider these
32:03 - hold on okay let's let's
32:05 - all right we're gonna do this
32:06 - collage
32:08 - of images so i'm gonna just make one of
32:10 - the option collage of images i'll worry
32:12 - about whether it's thumbnails or
32:14 - sketches later
32:16 - uh
32:19 - uh photo and uh i think this is a good
32:21 - idea i don't know why i'm making the
32:23 - poll
32:24 - so i'm gonna make that whole collage of
32:27 - images or something else
32:33 - i like the random number idea
32:35 - uh
32:36 - and um let's see is this poll going did
32:39 - it come i don't know if this is working
32:41 - does it show up on my
32:43 - side
32:45 - can i vote on it can i vote i made a
32:47 - poll did it did it show up does anybody
32:49 - see it
32:51 - no let me it's i think i think we all
32:54 - know what we need to do right now
32:56 - uh
32:57 - bear with me kind of wandering around
33:00 - back here
33:02 - do you hear that
33:05 - listen do you hear that
33:15 - let's go back and listen myself later
33:20 - oh wait
33:21 - there's so many cables
33:31 - okay i'm looking at the pole now
33:34 - i see collage of images is winning at
33:37 - the moment
33:39 - weird on the ipad app for youtube the
33:42 - poll doesn't seem to show up
33:44 - but um
33:46 - yeah
33:47 - you can hear it
33:49 - right so
33:50 - uh the word processing or its logo made
33:53 - up of your thumbnails yeah that's what i
33:55 - would like to do oh no the poll is here
33:57 - okay great
33:59 - i am okay don't worry everybody
34:06 - this is going to make us all feel better
34:09 - no
34:12 - but wait
34:14 - i had a whole system for this
34:16 - so oh no where were we so unfortunately
34:19 - i can't get into the discord right now
34:21 - because
34:22 - would you really like to know why oh i'm
34:24 - so glad you asked the reason why i can't
34:25 - get into the discord on this laptop is
34:28 - because it got logged out and the only
34:30 - way for me to log back in is to get my
34:32 - two-factor authorization code which is
34:35 - currently
34:36 - only available through my phone which is
34:38 - plugged in over there
34:40 - and uh in order to get this shot
34:44 - so i guess i could kind of get into it
34:46 - somehow and then run over there and get
34:47 - the code and come back but that seems
34:49 - like a lot of effort can somebody tell
34:51 - me where i was when i was last reading
34:52 - the random numbers
34:54 - [Music]
34:57 - this is my random number book it helps
35:00 - calm me down
35:01 - helps bring me some peace it is my
35:03 - personal dark hold
35:05 - is that a thing you could say i don't
35:07 - know oh uh no it's you're seeing me uh
35:09 - we're gonna go with the collage of
35:11 - images so i love this idea
35:14 - we'll make a collage of coding terrain
35:16 - let's start with the idea of thumbnails
35:18 - because i can just get those like those
35:20 - already exist
35:22 - um
35:23 - we'll i will see if i can make a photo
35:26 - mosaic
35:27 - uh of
35:28 - them um to
35:31 - show like the p5 or processing logo
35:35 - i think the p5 just i'm just going to do
35:37 - the text p5
35:39 - so
35:41 - [Music]
35:43 - so let's go open up processing four
35:49 - you join this music
35:50 - [Music]
35:55 - uh so i am yeah simon's like how are you
35:57 - i'm i'm logged into the discord
36:00 - over i'm seeing so i i am logged in the
36:02 - discord on the pc but it's sort of set
36:05 - up my console is set up with like a view
36:07 - of just one channel with the font really
36:09 - big so i can see the messages and i
36:11 - would have to go over there and switch
36:13 - to another channel and scroll around and
36:15 - it's just very inconvenient to do that
36:19 - music is very unnecessary
36:22 - okay so let's get started
36:26 - don't you love the new processing 4
36:28 - design
36:30 - i really love it
36:32 - and i know i've made a photo mosaic
36:35 - before
36:38 - i think i made a photo mosaic of obama
36:41 - that's one of the coding challenges
36:43 - let's go look at that maybe we should
36:44 - just start with that code that'll get us
36:46 - started a little faster
36:49 - uh
36:51 - photo mosaic
36:55 - so let's go to this
36:58 - and let's download this code
37:01 - so i'm going to start from here
37:04 - and see where this gets us
37:10 - um and uh let's i'm just gonna put this
37:13 - on the desktop
37:15 - and i'm gonna call this
37:17 - um
37:18 - coding train
37:20 - processing p5
37:22 - mosaic okay this is the name of our
37:24 - project by the way i don't i wonder if
37:26 - this i can't remember if this changed in
37:28 - processing four but um
37:30 - uh at least in older versions of
37:32 - processing and maybe still the name of
37:34 - the pde file the sketch has to match
37:37 - um so let's open this up
37:39 - the data here is
37:42 - um this is the image to make the photo
37:45 - so i'm going to change this to like p5
37:48 - so let's um
37:50 - open up photoshop it should make this
37:52 - all right let's do this in p5
37:55 - okay so we know the aspect and by the
37:58 - way i do need to take a break at around
37:59 - 11 30 and make sure i tell you about the
38:02 - sponsor brilliant
38:05 - don't let me forget
38:07 - um so the information about the specs is
38:11 - where
38:13 - uh
38:14 - 2250 by 3 000. so i'm going to just do
38:17 - 225 by 300 to start
38:21 - um so
38:23 - just to get like a basic version going i
38:26 - i'm like arbitrarily using p5 and
38:29 - processing just to like have fun and use
38:31 - both of them for no good reason okay
38:33 - just in case you're like why are you
38:34 - doing this
38:35 - uh so let's make the background 255
38:39 - fill 0
38:42 - text
38:43 - p5
38:45 - we'll put it in the middle
38:50 - okay let me just talk about what this is
38:52 - that's gunfire that you hear
38:54 - i am in the hudson valley uh my new home
38:57 - is here
38:58 - um and i believe that i live somewhat
39:01 - close to a skeet shooting range
39:05 - i mean it's pretty far away if you look
39:07 - on the map
39:08 - but you can definitely hear the gunshots
39:10 - it could also just be somebody who is
39:12 - doing some target practice in their
39:13 - backyard somewhere
39:15 - around here but it's a little
39:16 - disconcerting to me i am not
39:18 - a gun person uh i
39:21 - uh uh i i i now is not the time for me
39:24 - to get into a long uh a rant about gun
39:26 - control and gun culture here in this
39:28 - country that i live but it's uh i can't
39:31 - not acknowledge that sound that's going
39:33 - on in the background
39:35 - uh
39:36 - the ipad angle is going to hurt your
39:38 - wrist if you use it for too long yes
39:40 - right now it's actually just a
39:42 - uh an extra screen for me to look at i'm
39:45 - following the chat there francello says
39:48 - no more cabana
39:50 - oh i i just want to talk to you about
39:51 - all the things
39:53 - i got to make this community
39:54 - contribution though the cabana is not
39:56 - gone for good
39:57 - um
39:58 - i'm taking some time to live here and
40:00 - set up this new studio and we'll
40:02 - probably return to brooklyn and the the
40:05 - cabana is still a place that i have
40:07 - access to it's complicated uh not ever
40:10 - not all the time maybe not for a year
40:12 - but then i might come back to it
40:14 - i'm happy to like explain all the
40:15 - details it's just a long story and i
40:17 - don't have time to go into that right
40:18 - now
40:19 - uh maybe i'll do it uh what's the thing
40:22 - is clubhouse clubhouse is no longer a
40:24 - thing right i need to do like a discord
40:26 - stage and i could tell you my life story
40:28 - i'm sure you will all be fascinated uh
40:30 - to hear that but i got to get back to
40:32 - this uh but um
40:38 - making videos in the style of coding in
40:40 - the cabana whether it's in the physical
40:42 - cabana that's located in brooklyn or
40:44 - some new outdoor setup here where i have
40:46 - a lot of space
40:48 - i would love to do that uh in the new in
40:50 - next year right now teaching three
40:52 - classes trying to just live stream once
40:54 - a week and get some new tutorials out
40:56 - that's about all i can handle okay um
41:00 - what am i doing here unexpected end of
41:02 - input i need a
41:04 - a curly bracket oh that's beautiful okay
41:08 - there everybody i present to you now
41:12 - my brilliant
41:14 - sophisticated coding contribution to
41:18 - the processing community catalog
41:21 - i call it
41:23 - t5
41:30 - [Music]
41:35 - all right we're going to work on this a
41:36 - little bit more
41:37 - let's try making the text size
41:41 - uh 64.
41:42 - i'm going to turn on auto refresh
41:46 - i'm going gonna run it that's looking
41:48 - better can i get up to 128
41:51 - oh it's looking really good
41:53 - uh
41:54 - text font
41:56 - um what's a font that i could oh
41:59 - oh there's a new font
42:01 - there's a new font that is the new for
42:03 - the new coding train website i think i
42:05 - can end this poll or at least like get
42:07 - it out of my way there we go
42:09 - um
42:10 - so
42:13 - andre said you can sell it as an nft
42:17 - oh god speaking of things
42:20 - i don't have time to go off on a tangent
42:23 - about
42:24 - um
42:26 - text font so what is that font called
42:28 - maru i think i don't i mean i shouldn't
42:30 - be giving this away it's a new font that
42:32 - i love
42:33 - gt maru
42:34 - but i haven't purchased it yet
42:37 - um it's a really fun font that could be
42:39 - fun to put p5 in it but anybody know
42:41 - what the font i mean object could just
42:43 - load should probably just load the p5
42:45 - logo itself but let's just try i like a
42:48 - good
42:49 - fixed width font just as much as the
42:52 - next
42:54 - youtube streamer
42:56 - it's really loud
43:00 - and uh we can work worry about the seed
43:02 - image more later how can i make it can i
43:04 - make it bold
43:05 - how do you do that
43:07 - is that going to work no definitely not
43:12 - i i'm spending way too much time on this
43:14 - like little thing let's
43:16 - i think the default was good
43:18 - oh no okay hold on
43:20 - should it be a lowercase p
43:23 - uh what what happened there
43:31 - okay i like the uppercase p
43:33 - all right this is good enough
43:38 - save uh p5.png
43:43 - okay stop
43:45 - no block stop i don't want to block it
43:47 - actually oh
43:48 - allow
43:49 - allow okay so now that that was a
43:53 - tremendous amount of time how long did i
43:55 - spend doing that like 10 minutes just to
43:57 - get a seed image so let me take that
44:00 - let me put it into here
44:04 - um i
44:06 - you know um
44:08 - i don't think uh okay and let me open up
44:11 - sorry let me open up the
44:13 - the sketch that i'm basing it from
44:17 - oh hello how come that didn't open
44:25 - all right interesting i don't know how
44:27 - to use processing
44:29 - desktop
44:31 - ah here we go all right so let's call
44:33 - this uh p uh
44:35 - p5 image
44:39 - we're going to call it p5 image
44:43 - p5.png
44:46 - is that what i called it yeah
44:48 - and uh
44:50 - let's go with the
44:52 - dimensions
44:54 - uh that 225 by 300 225
44:58 - by 300 and
45:00 - let's multiply it by
45:03 - four and i think by the way in
45:07 - in uh thank you taser cake
45:11 - um roboto i like that font
45:16 - um wait i i don't i don't remember how
45:19 - this sketch works at all let's just
45:21 - actually have it be 225 by 300
45:23 - let's see what happens
45:26 - and this is gonna load okay
45:28 - okay so p5
45:30 - image
45:35 - i did guess i did something for resizing
45:37 - the image which
45:39 - array out of bounds exceptions see this
45:41 - is the problem with starting with some
45:43 - code that i made
45:44 - a long time ago i have no idea how it
45:46 - works
45:47 - did i comment it am i able to figure
45:49 - this out oh my goodness i have to sneeze
46:01 - okay i'm back from my sneezing
46:05 - um
46:06 - yeah so uh zaram is asking what what
46:09 - what what why is this called obama
46:11 - what's going on with obama a long time
46:12 - ago i made uh i
46:14 - showed an uh a sketch about how to make
46:17 - a photo mosaic and the sample image that
46:19 - i used was an image of former president
46:21 - obama
46:22 - um but right now index one out of bounds
46:26 - for length one
46:28 - the question is
46:30 - where did that error happen
46:34 - here
46:35 - files i plus one to string am i not oh
46:39 - starting at plus one to ignore this is
46:42 - look at this comment this oh brilliant
46:44 - coding i must have this is uh
46:47 - the lapel mic is noisy against the
46:49 - hoodie
46:51 - thank you for letting me know uh if it
46:53 - is acceptable right now
46:56 - um
46:58 - and not like impeding your ability to
47:00 - follow what i'm doing i'm gonna have to
47:02 - leave it but i i take that note and
47:04 - thank you
47:06 - let me see what i can do to improve that
47:08 - i actually want to buy a new lapel mic
47:09 - because if i'm going to use it i might
47:11 - as well have a really high quality one
47:12 - this is just one that i happen to have
47:15 - um
47:16 - all right so let's look here
47:18 - let's
47:19 - bright images all images
47:22 - all images
47:24 - p image 100.
47:28 - file name files oh no files
47:31 - data.photos
47:33 - so weird why oh using a smaller amount
47:35 - just for testing okay so let's look at
47:38 - um
47:39 - let's do print
47:41 - i think print array in processing will
47:43 - print out the array so let's just see
47:45 - what's here
47:48 - i mean obviously i want to get my
47:49 - thumbnails i just
47:52 - i want the console to move up there we
47:53 - go let's try running this
47:56 - aha
47:59 - oh
48:00 - i remember now
48:03 - look there's a readme file in there oh
48:06 - how convenient
48:07 - boy whoever documented these projects
48:09 - really did was very thoughtful
48:12 - this directory should be filled with
48:13 - images you'll then need to remove this
48:15 - file or at least add something to check
48:17 - that each balance directory is in a draw
48:19 - okay
48:20 - let's get some thumbnails now um
48:23 - can
48:24 - something like i could obviously well
48:27 - certainly if i had a lot of time and was
48:29 - doing um
48:31 - this more thoughtfully i might like to
48:32 - do a lesson on how to use the youtube
48:34 - api i already have some examples and i'm
48:37 - kind of tinkered with that during live
48:38 - streams
48:40 - um
48:43 - yeah and lee is pointing out a really
48:45 - good point which is the photo mosaic
48:46 - challenge was based on the brightness of
48:48 - each image to match an area of the obama
48:50 - photo and your p5 image only has black
48:52 - and white so
48:53 - uh but let me just get going with the
48:55 - way that i'm doing it and maybe we'll
48:57 - make the actual p5 image more
48:59 - interesting or think of a different way
49:01 - of doing it
49:02 - but one step at a time so how do i get
49:04 - my thumbnails i'm hoping there's a tool
49:06 - that i like to use called youtube dl
49:10 - and i wonder if this will
49:13 - allow me to just like get thumbnails
49:18 - of all embedding okay so um let's look
49:23 - thumbnails let's just look them does
49:24 - anybody know ah right thumbnail
49:28 - right all thumbnail image formats to
49:30 - disk so can i do
49:32 - skip down so i could do skip download
49:35 - and write thumbnail presumably okay so
49:38 - the question is do i have
49:41 - youtube
49:42 - dl currently
49:45 - installed on this computer
49:48 - uh sure
49:50 - why not
49:57 - okay so
50:01 - awesome
50:03 - i've already installed youtube dl so if
50:05 - you're following along and want to make
50:07 - your own thing and by the way
50:09 - whatever i do here today i'm looking for
50:11 - all of you to help with this so but
50:14 - at a minimum i'm going to upload
50:17 - everything that i do here to a github
50:19 - repo and i will gladly take
50:21 - contributions all day long to improve
50:24 - the visual design
50:26 - etc of what i'm making so please
50:29 - i would love your contributions here
50:31 - okay
50:32 - um
50:33 - so i let's just first do something like
50:37 - uh let's just go get an individual i'm
50:39 - gonna get like the snake video uh for
50:42 - example
50:43 - which is the most watched video on the
50:45 - coding train
50:46 - uh and i'm gonna say youtube dl i think
50:50 - i can give it the link to that video
50:52 - then i to say get thumbnail
50:55 - simulate quiet but print i want to write
50:57 - thumbnail
50:58 - oh no that's like a ver okay skip
51:00 - download
51:03 - oh it's like simulate that's interesting
51:06 - i um so see that's really useful like
51:09 - one of the things i try to do with
51:10 - youtube download is figure out is this
51:12 - really gonna work to download my entire
51:14 - channel like i've done that like
51:15 - download everything from the channel
51:17 - but um
51:19 - like how do i know if it's gonna work
51:21 - because i got to sit there and wait for
51:22 - it to download everything but you can i
51:23 - guess you can run the simulate thing and
51:25 - it'll just like step through everything
51:26 - without downloading super useful so skip
51:28 - download
51:31 - right
51:32 - thumbnail where was that
51:36 - embed thumbnail thumbnail right thumb
51:39 - write all thumbnails
51:42 - simulate list thumbnails let's do this
51:43 - first because i i might this might give
51:45 - me a clue of what i want to get
51:50 - so this is giving me all these
51:51 - thumbnails with different so i think
51:54 - probably
51:57 - i mean for a photo mosaic that's going
51:59 - to go on a big high resolution page this
52:02 - size is probably big enough doesn't look
52:05 - like there's anything larger
52:08 - so certainly i want the and what if i
52:10 - just do
52:11 - a right thumbnail
52:13 - which one is it going to give me
52:19 - uh
52:20 - what size did it give me by default oops
52:23 - oh okay first of all
52:26 - i should be a little bit more careful
52:28 - i'm just doing all of this right now
52:31 - at user slash codingtrain
52:34 - so let's go to
52:36 - this project what i call it
52:39 - p5 mosaic
52:41 - uh we can do it from within here
52:45 - yeah this is good
52:47 - let's go to here
52:50 - let's run this previous command again
52:56 - now
52:58 - we should have
53:01 - an image okay whoops
53:05 - what what is going on with me here oh
53:07 - here we go let's see an image
53:09 - it is
53:13 - 336 by 188 so that's very low resolution
53:16 - but i think we'll do fine the one thing
53:18 - i don't love about this is it's very
53:20 - vain like i'm i mean
53:22 - i guess it's my own fault you know i
53:24 - should i i don't know why i'm like all
53:26 - of a sudden like oh i'm making my
53:27 - community contribution page i don't want
53:29 - my face in it like my face is everywhere
53:32 - otherwise
53:34 - um
53:35 - so
53:36 - uh yeah i guess i will go with it for
53:38 - now but um
53:40 - so that looks good so now um i believe
53:43 - what i can do i'm just going to start
53:44 - with the coding challenges
53:46 - um that'll be a good start if i go to
53:49 - like the coding train channel i think
53:52 - this is the
53:54 - coding challenge playlist
53:57 - so if i go here
53:59 - i think i should be able to say
54:02 - um
54:03 - the same thing
54:08 - but i put the playlist
54:14 - uh in i guess i could have done the
54:15 - simulate thing but let's
54:18 - so it should be downing downloading 222
54:20 - thumbnails right now
54:25 - um
54:26 - looking at the chat
54:28 - um
54:29 - [Music]
54:33 - all right let's see how this is going
54:34 - this is fun
54:38 - so um
54:39 - you know for those of you who might be
54:41 - wondering like how can you do this
54:42 - yourself
54:43 - um so this is the youtube um
54:47 - youtube dl project and i would assume
54:50 - here under installation
54:52 - this is these are some instructions for
54:55 - how to download it so what's what will
54:56 - be confusing for you if you're kind of
54:59 - new to all of this maybe you've just
55:01 - you're just learning p5.js right now is
55:03 - all of this it needs to be done through
55:06 - sort of console terminal access
55:09 - shell access to your computer so if
55:11 - you're a unix user you probably know all
55:13 - about that
55:14 - mac os
55:16 - i'm using something called item that's
55:18 - what this is but the the
55:20 - built into your computer is something
55:22 - called terminal
55:24 - so in theory you could open up terminal
55:26 - and follow these instructions ah the
55:28 - camera
55:30 - there's really no reason for it to like
55:32 - not
55:33 - hold a charge it's plugged in
55:37 - um i'm going to just live with this for
55:39 - a little bit right now
55:41 - and switch to this view so i'm just
55:45 - you're getting my voice and my
55:47 - screencast here
55:50 - so um and windows it looks like you can
55:53 - download an exe so if you are on
55:57 - um
55:59 - if you are on windows um
56:03 - try that and maybe in the chat people
56:05 - could talk about um other ways
56:08 - to um to do that it's interesting now
56:10 - that like the camera's not on me i feel
56:12 - so free i'm like reading the chat
56:14 - looking down i'm like walking over here
56:16 - to find my water
56:18 - having a little drink of water now which
56:19 - you can probably hear
56:25 - i could walk outside and shoot some
56:26 - hoops i have a little basketball hoop
56:28 - about
56:29 - 20 feet from me
56:30 - [Laughter]
56:32 - i've got a wireless mic i can do
56:34 - anything i'm not on camera anymore
56:36 - um okay so let's see how that's going
56:40 - okay we're still
56:42 - so we're still doing this interestingly
56:45 - enough
56:46 - i believe
56:49 - that i could
56:51 - first of all we should we could improve
56:52 - this right
56:55 - there's got to be a way
56:57 - well if it works it works i just i don't
56:59 - love this um
57:02 - this is as the method to um
57:06 - ignore ds.store
57:08 - but uh let's go and uh
57:11 - we're in this directory we've got let's
57:13 - just check what's coming in
57:15 - to see so
57:17 - first of all these are all very very
57:19 - similar in design they will change oh
57:21 - why are some of them like all of a
57:23 - sudden super high res
57:25 - that's so interesting like what so
57:27 - arbitrary
57:33 - all right so
57:35 - by the way here's the uh
57:38 - here's the obama photo mosaic
57:41 - coding challenge but i used to make so
57:44 - many of these
57:45 - and what's happened to me
57:48 - ah
57:49 - oh
57:50 - oh memories
57:52 - like the corner of my mind
57:55 - [Music]
57:57 - uh now the lawnmower from the neighbor
57:59 - is going i don't know if you can hear
58:01 - that
58:02 - um all right or how are we doing there
58:04 - still downloading oh we're so close to
58:06 - being done let's give it a let's wait a
58:08 - little bit
58:09 - um
58:17 - no oh yeah sorry the chat people are
58:19 - saying there's a helicopter no no that's
58:21 - a lawn mower
58:22 - not a helicopter
58:24 - [Music]
58:30 - all right um
58:32 - i'm getting so close now
58:38 - yeah
58:41 - oh yeah yeah that's a lawn mower all
58:43 - right
58:46 - what time is it 11
58:49 - 25 okay
58:51 - [Music]
58:58 - some images are saved as web pm and
59:01 - others as jpeg that is useful for me to
59:05 - note
59:06 - again i don't need to have the perfect
59:08 - finished version oh yeah oh no
59:12 - webp is going to cause me a problem
59:16 - probably gonna need to do this again
59:19 - like i don't know if processing is gonna
59:20 - be able to open a webp image
59:25 - but let's see what happens
59:27 - let's at least let this finish okay
59:29 - finished
59:32 - did i turn hold on i just want to make
59:33 - the key i'm going to make sure the
59:34 - camera is actually charging
59:38 - yeah it is
59:39 - so at some point i don't know what's a
59:41 - good amount of time for me to wait
59:43 - but somebody remind me at some point to
59:44 - go turn the camera back on
59:46 - i could also use just like my webcam
59:50 - here
59:54 - this is going to be fun
59:56 - new
59:57 - movie recording
60:00 - this is like
60:02 - hi everybody
60:04 - put that over here
60:07 - and move this back over
60:10 - here we go
60:11 - i'm back on screen everybody did you
60:13 - miss me
60:15 - here i am up there no i'm here i'm here
60:17 - my green screen behind me
60:21 - okay um
60:23 - so this will this will get us
60:25 - a little bit further now let's see what
60:27 - happens
60:30 - could not find a method to load
60:32 - web p
60:37 - so how do i get
60:39 - the format
60:41 - so now i need to go back to
60:44 - um
60:45 - here
60:46 - thumbnail
60:48 - right thumb
60:49 - list thumbnails
60:54 - shoot does anybody know
60:59 - how
61:00 - to
61:01 - look at this sketches over here
61:03 - does anybody know
61:05 - how to tell it to
61:10 - make sure to get the thumbnail as a jpeg
61:11 - i guess i could write a script now to
61:13 - convert all of them i could do that in
61:15 - node
61:18 - uh processing can't load webp so many of
61:21 - them came in as web p
61:24 - i'm now i'm i'm stuck you're lost hold
61:27 - on let's
61:28 - other thing i can do here there's a
61:30 - temporary solution while i think about
61:31 - this or get a suggestion
61:34 - um let's go over here and go to a
61:38 - list i want list view
61:41 - and
61:42 - let's sort it by kind
61:45 - and let's just get rid of all the webp
61:47 - images
61:49 - so that's a webp image
61:51 - i'm just going to delete all the webp
61:53 - images
61:56 - ultimately i just want to start with
61:57 - something
62:02 - and is this 100 images did i get 100
62:07 - uh
62:09 - so tell me how many images are in this
62:11 - folder 67 items oh i was so close
62:16 - i was so close
62:18 - 67 so i think it should be okay
62:21 - if now
62:23 - uh i just do 67
62:26 - or like oh yeah
62:29 - whatever the length of it is
62:32 - uh because this was just to use a
62:33 - smaller amount for testing okay
62:36 - let's see what we get now and sorry this
62:39 - uh this sketch can go away don't save
62:42 - let's see what we get
62:45 - okay could not find a method to load ds
62:47 - store but what of my my full proof
62:51 - solution there's no way that anything
62:53 - could ever go wrong
62:55 - if i have this brilliant i plus one line
62:58 - of code so that i ignore ds store
63:05 - let's print line files all right we're
63:07 - going to have to improve this error
63:09 - checking
63:12 - oh look there's a bunch of
63:15 - bad data may not contain an image
63:19 - oh come on so cruel to me that things
63:22 - have to go wrong
63:25 - so is ds store coming at the end all
63:27 - right let's let's fix some things here
63:30 - boy this is a very uh exciting live
63:32 - stream let's just see
63:34 - make sure all of these are valid images
63:36 - there's only 67 of them
63:39 - how could there be bad data they're all
63:41 - working fine for me
63:45 - ah
63:47 - no i mean what should be wrong with this
63:48 - one it's a jpeg
63:50 - and it's the last one
63:52 - giant
63:54 - face
63:57 - convert thumbnails format
64:00 - uh says oscar
64:02 - bartos i think it is on youtube not
64:04 - youtube dl
64:06 - sponsor break reminder yeah no i want to
64:09 - get a little bit let me at least get i
64:11 - want to get something to run without an
64:13 - error
64:14 - and then
64:16 - so uh i am going to change
64:20 - all images
64:22 - to what am i filling
64:24 - i'm filling
64:26 - why did i do this oh cause i want to
64:28 - like
64:30 - change the size of all of them no matter
64:32 - what they are
64:33 - image okay all images
64:36 - i would like to make all images an
64:38 - arraylist that way i can
64:41 - i can vet any given image
64:44 - and then um sorry that i'm like talking
64:47 - to that camera which is not at all
64:48 - active i can vet any given image and
64:51 - then add it to the arraylist and like i
64:53 - don't have to know the exact amount of
64:55 - images i'm going to have
64:57 - so this is why i should would like to be
64:59 - in javascript right now but
65:01 - arraylist sorry goes like this arraylist
65:04 - of p image objects
65:06 - is a new arraylist
65:08 - of p image
65:11 - objects is that how i do it i think
65:13 - that's how i use an arraylist in
65:14 - processing
65:18 - all images so i don't need this anymore
65:22 - and then
65:23 - um
65:26 - brightness
65:28 - so this i'll do later
65:32 - this i'll do later
65:34 - well no this is always going to be 256
65:37 - images
65:39 - uh print line files yeah i still want to
65:42 - do that so now i want to go through all
65:44 - of the files
65:47 - file name
65:48 - equals files index i
65:52 - to string now
65:55 - i need to say if file name i mean i
65:58 - could i kind of want to use a regular
66:00 - expression
66:02 - but i'm just going to say index of i
66:04 - think index of
66:06 - dot jpeg
66:07 - so for all jpegs is greater than
66:09 - negative one
66:11 - then i can do all this stuff
66:18 - and i'm going to say otherwise print
66:19 - line
66:20 - not a valid image
66:27 - so
66:28 - uh so i think this should be good this
66:30 - should be a nice little check
66:32 - to make sure it is a jpeg
66:36 - let's print line the file name
66:39 - and forget about this
66:41 - so i'm going to go through every file
66:43 - one at a time why not filter the files
66:45 - list yeah oh
66:47 - abominal monkey in the chat is giving
66:50 - the suggestion of exactly what i'm doing
66:52 - old reddit post suggests using ffmpeg to
66:54 - convert the webp images that's a good
66:56 - idea
66:57 - okay
66:58 - let's try this and see if
67:00 - oops i must be missing
67:02 - i must have messed something up oh
67:06 - no no no no no wait what
67:10 - what
67:11 - what is this
67:12 - find the closest image for east
67:14 - brightness value
67:17 - all images i'm so confused
67:20 - oh
67:23 - so oh i should i should be really making
67:25 - an object here so i should make my uh
67:29 - all right
67:32 - welcome to
67:33 - welcome to
67:36 - refactoring old code with me your host
67:39 - dan
67:40 - shiffman meanwhile three hours later no
67:44 - project has been made
67:46 - [Music]
67:48 - uh all right so i if you if you will
67:51 - bear with me although the brightness
67:53 - thing we're even thinking we maybe we
67:54 - don't even want but i i can't help it
67:59 - and i know i need to take a break
68:01 - but
68:03 - so i'm going to say
68:04 - image tile
68:08 - i'm going to make a class called an
68:09 - image tile
68:11 - which has a p image in it
68:14 - and then a brightness
68:16 - value that's a
68:18 - function in processing but i don't think
68:20 - that matters
68:22 - wait what's wrong with this
68:24 - oh because i'm missing some something
68:26 - else
68:27 - um and then i need to write the
68:32 - constructor uh
68:38 - image is in it so i'm going to make it
68:42 - you know let's i i think maybe we don't
68:44 - set the brightness till later
68:47 - so just set it equal to zero to start
68:51 - and
68:52 - so now i don't need this separate array
68:56 - don't need this separate array
68:58 - okay wait i'm frozen
69:01 - let's see if the camera works again
69:04 - because i don't know why that camera
69:05 - froze
69:06 - um
69:10 - um let's see here uh camera oops nope
69:14 - uh let's see if i can get the camera
69:16 - back
69:17 - how we doing camera
69:19 - did you get to charge up at all
69:23 - i wonder if like the
69:25 - battery's not even in there or something
69:28 - okay you're on
69:31 - uh yeah oh there's a charge the battery
69:34 - has a charge in it and it's plugged in
69:36 - this is a good sign
69:40 - okay we're back people i'm very small i
69:43 - don't know i've kind of picked an
69:44 - arbitrary size for myself
69:46 - okay so the idea now is my arraylist is
69:50 - of image tile objects
69:56 - and then
69:57 - i am going to load an image
70:03 - oh this isn't going to work
70:07 - what is going on i'm going to load the
70:10 - image
70:11 - oh i know what i'm going to do this
70:14 - should go in the constructor
70:17 - oh
70:18 - fancy
70:22 - so now this happens so this whole thing
70:24 - that i was doing in the
70:28 - array i'm going to do here
70:34 - and
70:37 - i'm copying
70:40 - what am i copying i'm copying this
70:43 - the image coming in i'm copying
70:47 - this image
70:49 - is this the source or the destination
70:50 - this is the destination this is the
70:53 - source so i need the source width and
70:55 - height
70:56 - and then the destination is this image's
70:58 - size
71:00 - and then oh yeah yeah this is so why why
71:02 - didn't i do that this way before then
71:04 - this
71:07 - should all
71:09 - go here
71:12 - and
71:14 - brightness is the average
71:18 - of all the
71:20 - of all the pixels
71:22 - and this is not all images i this is
71:26 - that image
71:32 - so basically
71:34 - my object is taking care of this
71:36 - complicated scenario
71:38 - where i am going to make a
71:42 - image tile
71:48 - and you know what i think
71:50 - out of that image
71:52 - and then all images dot add that tile
71:56 - otherwise it's not a valid image now
71:59 - this is something else that's going on
72:02 - um
72:04 - so now none of this is gonna work and
72:06 - then there's this other thing
72:10 - bright images.length
72:13 - oh it's looking for the one so this is
72:15 - this i actually don't want to do but
72:18 - i want to do something different like
72:20 - the way that i made this photo mosaic
72:21 - because it had one image per brightness
72:24 - value and i probably want to keep track
72:25 - of multiple ones
72:26 - but i guess i should just to get
72:28 - something working here
72:31 - um
72:33 - just to get something working here
72:35 - looking at the chat it didn't declare
72:37 - scale i think scale is a global variable
72:41 - it doesn't really make sense for it to
72:43 - be but it's just a global variable
72:45 - um
72:46 - so what was this so bright images is the
72:49 - 255
72:50 - array 256 array okay
72:53 - absolute value of i minus
72:57 - um
72:58 - oh go through
73:01 - all images dot size
73:05 - then this would be
73:06 - all images
73:10 - get
73:11 - j dot brightness that would be the
73:13 - equivalent here
73:15 - and then i
73:16 - guess the bright image would be
73:21 - all images
73:23 - get
73:24 - j its image
73:26 - okay
73:27 - so this should be and y is there
73:31 - and this should happen after this
73:33 - so i think i have an extra bracket
73:37 - so i think this might
73:39 - in theory
73:45 - do something that works now
73:50 - i mean this is definitely going to break
73:52 - right
73:53 - because i think oh wait no why why why
73:56 - is image tile
73:57 - does not exist
73:58 - yes it does oh image tile image tile
74:01 - okay
74:03 - okay
74:07 - uh
74:08 - the type of expression must be an array
74:10 - type oh
74:11 - all images i this is just that
74:14 - particular image okay try this again
74:25 - ladies
74:27 - gentlemen
74:29 - everyone that that doesn't include
74:33 - also there's gonna be a better way to
74:35 - say that
74:36 - y'all
74:38 - i present to you my p5
74:42 - community contribution
74:46 - is
74:47 - one coding challenge
74:49 - followed by a blank thumbnail
74:53 - that is amazing okay i'm gonna take a
74:55 - break so this is a good start
74:58 - this is a good good start
75:01 - so uh we're gonna have to think about
75:03 - how to improve this
75:04 - uh what time is it it's 11 40. i've got
75:07 - another hour-ish to go um i should
75:10 - probably check my oh i'm going to take a
75:12 - break where i get to like check my
75:13 - messages and make sure everything's okay
75:15 - um
75:18 - but
75:18 - before i take my break
75:21 - don't go anywhere because i'm coming
75:23 - back to make this way more exciting and
75:26 - i need you i need you to help me and i
75:29 - also need to help me i need my friends
75:32 - over at brilliant
75:35 - the coding train today is sponsored by
75:37 - brilliant what is brilliance you might
75:40 - be asking yourself i mean if you've
75:41 - watched the coding train before you know
75:43 - about brilliant because i talk about it
75:46 - a lot it is a website it is an app and
75:49 - if i could get my act together here i'm
75:51 - going to
75:53 - i'm very excited because i have a new
75:55 - way to show you brilliant
75:57 - oh but i have these buttons here so i'm
75:59 - going to switch over to just play
76:00 - something right now and let's go to this
76:02 - one this is one of my favorite brilliant
76:04 - courses um and it's showing it is about
76:08 - how to work through algorithms and code
76:11 - you can see here it's under the topic of
76:13 - conditional algorithms interactive
76:15 - lessons so unlike just being there
76:19 - watching me on video
76:21 - talk talk talk talk talk talk draw draw
76:23 - draw draw draw
76:24 - you can really get your hands in there
76:26 - on your own time
76:28 - relaxed uh with your computer with your
76:31 - tablet with your phone you can go
76:33 - through interactive lessons on courses
76:34 - on geometry and computer science and so
76:37 - so so much more um i need to get back to
76:40 - those coding challenges what's the
76:41 - what's a great place for me to get a
76:43 - whole bunch of ideas for coding
76:44 - challenges brilliant is a great place
76:46 - for that so um if you will bear with me
76:49 - for a moment i am going to
76:53 - um go over here
76:55 - but i just want to go to my camera view
76:57 - i'm going to try something new here i'm
76:59 - very excited about this i'm going to i
77:01 - should have had this setup ready to go
77:02 - earlier
77:04 - let me go to new
77:06 - movie recording
77:08 - um but i'm going to yes get my ipad
77:11 - and then i'm going to go over here
77:14 - and open up brilliant
77:16 - so now i have for you
77:19 - uh
77:20 - the
77:21 - um brilliant
77:23 - um there's a truck here but that's okay
77:26 - um
77:27 - i have for you here
77:29 - the brilliant app
77:32 - so um you can see courses that i'm going
77:34 - through
77:35 - beautiful geometry is one
77:37 - geometry fundamentals i can i can make
77:39 - this larger just by uh zooming into it
77:42 - these are four that i am
77:44 - in the process of wonderful courses uh
77:48 - popular courses here we've got logic
77:50 - scientific thinking computer science
77:51 - fundamentals pre-algebra and all of
77:54 - these include 60 plus courses
77:56 - all of them include interactive lessons
77:59 - math science computer science oh my god
78:01 - so much good stuff
78:03 - and a casino probability oh
78:06 - i'm excited about that you know if you
78:08 - like random numbers like me look at all
78:10 - these statistics and probability courses
78:12 - so amazing oh so much more stuff that
78:14 - i'm discovering so i'm scrolling through
78:16 - here um i think what i want to do i was
78:18 - looking at this this morning is i'm
78:20 - going to go to today
78:22 - and let's take a look at
78:24 - oh let's take a look at the daily
78:26 - challenge um
78:28 - um this one actually would be really
78:29 - good
78:30 - so both of these are good let's let's
78:32 - actually do i'm gonna do the random
78:34 - darts one i went through earlier and uh
78:37 - looked at this yellow triangle one and i
78:38 - was excited to try to solve it because i
78:40 - think all i need is the knowledge of the
78:43 - pythagorean theorem
78:45 - but uh i see this random darts one and i
78:48 - think this is one of the things that i
78:50 - love to do with brilliant and in these
78:52 - sponsor segments is i like to take one
78:55 - of their lessons and use it as an
78:57 - opportunity to code a p5.js sketch to
79:01 - find the solution so of course i could
79:03 - often calculate through some
79:05 - mathematical formula or through
79:06 - intuition what the answer is
79:09 - but with this one i think i can make a
79:11 - p5 sketch so i'm going to give myself
79:13 - five or ten minutes to work through this
79:15 - um i probably should mention though of
79:17 - course that i would
79:19 - if you're interested in following along
79:20 - and doing these challenges and
79:22 - participating you can sign up for free
79:24 - at brilliant.org codingtrain if you do
79:26 - that it lets them know that you found
79:28 - out about brilliant for me it helps me
79:30 - out um and then um you know you can do a
79:33 - lot of the um a lot of these the content
79:35 - is available for free and then of course
79:37 - there is a premium subscription to
79:38 - unlock all of their courses and a 20 off
79:41 - through that link now
79:43 - let's let's take a look at this problem
79:45 - chelsea is playing darts
79:49 - on a dart board made of four concentric
79:51 - squares whose colors alternate blue
79:53 - and yellow the side length of the
79:55 - outermost square is eight with each
79:57 - smaller square the side length rises by
79:58 - two
80:00 - so she closes her eyes throws a dart
80:02 - toward the dartboard and hears that it
80:04 - is hit assuming the dart has an equally
80:06 - likely chance of landing anywhere on the
80:08 - board what is the probability it landed
80:10 - on blue so i could work this out by
80:14 - knowing the formula for an area of a
80:17 - square and then understanding you know
80:20 - how much of a given square is
80:23 - colored
80:24 - blue what is taken out by yellow then
80:26 - added again but
80:28 - um
80:29 - and i would like one of the things that
80:30 - was fun that i did last time
80:32 - is i'm going to end this poll
80:36 - and i'm going to put a new poll in
80:38 - so
80:40 - come on let me put a new poll in
80:43 - scroll down
80:45 - do i need to refresh
80:46 - the chat
80:49 - uh
80:49 - yes okay so i'm going to ask
80:53 - what is it that we're doing here we're
80:54 - looking for
80:56 - a probability of blue
81:00 - probability
81:02 - of blue the answers are
81:05 - 2 out of 5 1 out of 2
81:09 - 5 out of 8
81:12 - or three out of four
81:15 - and so what i'm going to put that poll
81:18 - up
81:20 - oh my god that is very loud
81:23 - i'm going to put a poll up and i'm going
81:25 - to see the results it might take a
81:27 - minute for it to show up
81:30 - and what i'm going to do right now
81:32 - is i am going to create a p5 sketch
81:36 - to simulate the actual throwing of the
81:39 - darts this is actually very similar to
81:41 - one of my pi day coding challenges where
81:43 - i approximated the value of pi by
81:45 - simulating throwing darts at a circle
81:48 - drawn in p5 so let's start with 400 by
81:52 - 400
81:54 - and let's look at what is um oh
81:57 - let's look at this again so i have it
81:59 - over here uh
82:02 - the last side length of the outermost
82:04 - square is eight with each smaller square
82:06 - the side length decreases by two so
82:08 - let's make this um i think i could do
82:10 - the math in my head right so this is
82:13 - like 400 if so so if the first square
82:17 - which is blue
82:22 - and let's do rect mode center
82:27 - if the first square is blue um
82:32 - 200 200 400 400 let's uh right so that's
82:36 - blue oh i made it kind of like a so that
82:39 - first square is blue then i need to go
82:41 - and reduce
82:44 - i the next one should be yellow which i
82:46 - will just do red i'm just going to use
82:48 - simpler colors for rgb values
82:52 - i guess i could fill it with like yeah
82:54 - let's just do this though and now
82:57 - erect oh i don't need to say wreck mode
82:59 - center
83:01 - and now it
83:02 - if reduce it by 2 means 800 would go to
83:06 - 600 so 400 would go to 300. so this is
83:09 - really by the way square
83:12 - and i don't need the last argument
83:15 - and square
83:17 - and i don't need the last argument by
83:19 - the way why ask yourself an interesting
83:21 - question why did it suddenly show up as
83:24 - a circle when i had that last argument
83:28 - so that last argument for rectangles is
83:31 - the rounding of the corner for a rounded
83:34 - rectangle and i don't know if this is
83:36 - like the radius of the rounding so with
83:38 - a really big radius of the rounding it's
83:39 - basically a circle which is kind of
83:41 - interesting
83:42 - okay so then we need a another
83:47 - so obviously i could do this with a loop
83:49 - or but i really only need to do
83:52 - uh
83:53 - one more
83:55 - 200
83:56 - um
83:58 - and
83:59 - what happened to that oops the first one
84:01 - i didn't mean to i meant to copy it
84:04 - so 400
84:06 - and then i need one more and just to
84:08 - like you can see what i'm doing i'm
84:09 - recreating this diagram
84:14 - and
84:15 - um 100
84:18 - and this one should be red
84:22 - oops no
84:24 - i've been working in processing so my
84:26 - key commands okay so now i've recreated
84:28 - this diagram so now all i need to do is
84:32 - pick any random pixel and determine
84:34 - whether it is red or blue
84:38 - and i should say no stroke
84:41 - and then i should just look at the ratio
84:43 - of how many times i'm picking red
84:46 - or blue out of the total number of
84:48 - pixels so i actually need to check if
84:49 - it's blue
84:50 - so i should be able to do
84:53 - i'm going to do this in draw because
84:54 - it'll be fun to see it calculate this in
84:56 - real time
84:58 - so uh
84:59 - let's do let's first do a
85:02 - um
85:04 - i'm gonna make a probability paragraph
85:08 - probability
85:10 - paragraph equals create p
85:14 - um
85:17 - let's put zero then i'm the
85:19 - zero in it now you can't see it because
85:21 - the background is
85:23 - dark here in this high contrast mode so
85:26 - i think i should be able to say
85:27 - uh
85:29 - style
85:30 - font color is that or is it text color
85:35 - text color i do not know css
85:38 - somebody tell me what it is color
85:40 - probably just color
85:43 - yes just color
85:45 - and then
85:47 - uh style
85:48 - font size
85:50 - 64
85:52 - point
85:54 - okay great uh and let's just make this a
85:57 - div so it's
85:59 - um showing up there okay so now in draw
86:04 - uh i'm gonna in draw which this is in
86:07 - draw i'm going to
86:09 - take get a random x y value
86:12 - so let x equal
86:14 - floor random with
86:17 - let
86:18 - y because i need a
86:20 - random height
86:21 - so i need an x and a y i need them to be
86:24 - integers because i'm looking up a pixel
86:27 - and um
86:28 - [Music]
86:30 - i need the range so floor takes off the
86:32 - decimal point
86:33 - and i need the range between zero and
86:35 - the width and zero in the height
86:36 - so now i should be able to just say get
86:39 - for the color
86:40 - so the function get in p5
86:43 - just gets the pixel value at a
86:45 - particular pixel location
86:48 - and
86:49 - i forgot what format i'm getting it back
86:51 - in so let's just do this oh it's on auto
86:54 - refresh let me just say no loop for a
86:56 - moment so it doesn't loop
87:00 - and run it
87:02 - ah so beautiful i'm getting an array
87:04 - so actually since i've drawn this i can
87:06 - just check is the zero one two element
87:10 - blue
87:13 - if color equals
87:15 - um
87:16 - if color index 2 equals 255
87:21 - then and so i need a count i need
87:24 - total is zero
87:26 - and blue count
87:28 - is zero
87:29 - so then i want to increase the blue
87:32 - count by one
87:34 - and then
87:35 - let a
87:36 - probability equal blue count
87:40 - divided by
87:43 - uh the total and always increase the
87:45 - total i could use the frame count
87:47 - so let's do that and then i want to say
87:50 - probability
87:51 - p which is actually a div so it doesn't
87:54 - matter but it's going to bother me
87:56 - forever
87:57 - so the probability div
87:59 - is probability div equals
88:02 - uh dot html is i'm a number format this
88:06 - is one of my favorite functions in p5 by
88:07 - the way number format it lets you take a
88:11 - particular value
88:12 - and then say like i want only one
88:15 - leading digit and let's say three
88:17 - decimal places so you can see i'm always
88:20 - going to get that
88:22 - and it picked a blue one so it's 100 no
88:24 - it's zero well i need to take no loop
88:26 - out
88:27 - and now we should see it converge over
88:29 - time
88:31 - um
88:33 - so over time it should converge to and
88:35 - let's
88:37 - looks like it's converging to
88:40 - maybe
88:41 - 0.65 let's look at the poll by the way 5
88:45 - out of 8 is winning
88:47 - so you all thought
88:49 - 5 out of 8.
88:51 - so what is 5 divided by 8 4 out of 8 is
88:55 - one out of eight is point one five right
88:57 - so five divided by eight is point six
89:00 - five six two five oh yeah yeah point one
89:02 - two five
89:04 - so six two five so why am i i would
89:07 - think that i would get quite a bit
89:09 - closer
89:10 - so there's probably some issue with like
89:14 - maybe if with like uh like a single
89:16 - pixel
89:18 - that i'm missing
89:20 - um i'm just curious so i think we know
89:21 - the answer but it kind of bothers me i
89:24 - wonder if
89:25 - the stroke
89:27 - would really make a difference here
89:29 - stroke
89:32 - and then if it were blue and by the way
89:34 - i don't need to do them in yeah i do
89:36 - need to do them in this order because
89:37 - that's the order that i'm drawing them
89:39 - um
89:41 - so let me just try adding the strokes in
89:44 - to see if that really changes anything
89:46 - to get it a little bit more accurate
89:49 - um and so this should go
89:52 - uh here
89:55 - because there might be sort of like one
89:56 - pixel off and this should go here
90:00 - okay
90:01 - let's see over time
90:03 - if that helps anything
90:15 - yeah so i think look at this i'm really
90:18 - converging i mean it
90:19 - this is not an exact science the pseudo
90:23 - random number generator of p5 i mean i
90:25 - could have gone through and checked
90:27 - every pixel i don't have to do it random
90:29 - so that's another way i could do it i
90:30 - could have done it one pixel at a time
90:33 - that's i would love to do that right now
90:34 - i'm gonna leave that as an exercise for
90:36 - you what if you count every single pixel
90:39 - um
90:40 - oh come on i want to do that i want to
90:43 - do that i don't see that but but you get
90:45 - the idea like this is what this is one
90:47 - of the reasons why i think you should
90:49 - also join brilliant is you can find
90:51 - these puzzles you can find these
90:53 - challenges you can go through these
90:54 - courses um you know you could work out
90:56 - the math like i'm going to go over here
90:59 - uh and um
91:00 - i'm going to
91:01 - first let's answer it 5 8
91:04 - and uh i got it correct um let's look at
91:07 - show explanation
91:09 - and you can see here um you know this is
91:12 - a nice way where we could literally
91:14 - count up all of the red versus yellow
91:18 - blue versus yellow tiles we could work
91:20 - out a formula
91:22 - and you can see the probably the dart
91:23 - lands on blue is 40 out of 64 or 5 out
91:25 - of 8. so of course this was a much
91:27 - simpler problem that i made it but in so
91:30 - many cases so many of these
91:34 - courses um lead to of course the daily
91:37 - challenges the lessons in the courses
91:40 - lead to
91:41 - so many wonderful beautiful ideas for
91:44 - creative coding and visualization so if
91:46 - you like generative art if you like
91:48 - coding you're also going to like
91:49 - brilliant
91:50 - please consider signing up at
91:52 - brilliant.org
91:54 - codingtrain
91:55 - and
91:56 - i will um you could do that while i take
91:58 - a break um and i will be back in about
92:01 - five minutes to continue
92:03 - uh creating this incredible
92:06 - coding train
92:08 - communic catalog contribution for the
92:11 - processing community catalog
92:13 - um give me a couple minutes to take a
92:15 - short break drink some water
92:16 - check to make sure gloria is okay and
92:18 - then i'll come back and i've got about a
92:20 - half an hour or ish or so more to try to
92:22 - get this further along
92:25 - and there we go okay everybody i'm gonna
92:27 - put on some music and be right back
92:40 - [Music]
92:49 - [Music]
92:56 - [Music]
93:01 - do
93:03 - [Music]
93:15 - do
93:18 - [Music]
93:35 - [Music]
93:45 - [Music]
93:53 - [Music]

95:51 - [Music]
95:59 - [Music]
96:11 - [Music]
96:16 - do
96:17 - [Music]
96:22 - [Music]
96:37 - [Music]
96:47 - [Music]
96:58 - okay i believe
97:00 - [Music]
97:01 - i am back hi gloria oh she's looking at
97:04 - me like please when are you going to
97:05 - finish
97:06 - she really wants me to take her outside
97:08 - and wander around
97:10 - you can go sit in the sun it's right
97:12 - there
97:13 - i need definitely need the dog cam so
97:15 - you can see who i'm talking to
97:17 - um all right so uh if you're just tuning
97:20 - in right now um what i am doing is i'm
97:22 - making a contribution
97:24 - to the processing community catalog
97:27 - and um the reason i am doing this
97:30 - is
97:31 - um
97:33 - well one is i would like to make my own
97:35 - contribution but i would also like to
97:37 - encourage you to make your own
97:39 - contribution so i'm here i am
97:41 - making one soliciting your input showing
97:44 - you how to code some stuff i mean you
97:45 - probably want to make something
97:47 - completely different than what i'm doing
97:49 - um but i just want to point out today i
97:51 - mean i'm a little bit late to send you
97:52 - this reminder because the deadline is
97:55 - tonight uh at 11 59 pm uh pacific time
97:59 - so if you're on the east coast like me
98:01 - uh you've you've got uh you've got till
98:03 - 3 a.m but regardless you have i don't
98:06 - know 12 more hours or more than that um
98:09 - 12 15 more hours um so um now so what am
98:13 - i attempting to do so the idea that i
98:16 - started with is to make some type of
98:19 - collage of coding trained thumbnails and
98:22 - the goal there was to um
98:26 - have it be what am i trying to say uh
98:30 - maybe have it then that collage also
98:31 - represents some larger uh design maybe
98:35 - just the letter p and the letter five or
98:37 - the p5 logo so i'm not very far and i'm
98:40 - not gonna be live streaming all day and
98:41 - i'm gonna try to work on this more so at
98:44 - probably at 12 30 when it says 12 30
98:46 - everyone should sound the alarm in the
98:48 - chat
98:49 - and i should make sure to start working
98:51 - on putting everything on github
98:53 - documenting things so that anybody who
98:55 - wants to today could help me out or just
98:59 - run the code themselves or contribute
99:01 - ideas and the issues because i'm going
99:03 - to as i have little bits of time the
99:04 - rest of today all the way up until 3 a.m
99:06 - i will continue to work on this so where
99:09 - am i so far so first thing i did is i'm
99:12 - using youtube dl to download a whole
99:15 - bunch of thumbnails at some point i want
99:17 - to try to download all of my thumbnails
99:19 - if anybody happens to
99:21 - do that uh let me know and maybe i can
99:24 - put put make like a you could share it
99:26 - with me on dropbox or google drive or
99:28 - something um but um so that's one thing
99:31 - you could help with
99:33 - uh and then the other thing is and i
99:36 - have a plug that i want to make about
99:37 - the new coding train website but i've
99:39 - got some momentum here so don't let me
99:40 - forget that either
99:42 - this this is no longer
99:45 - um
99:46 - [Music]
99:47 - the obama stuff is from a previous
99:49 - example
99:50 - so if i run this what do i get
99:55 - wait what just happened
99:57 - why is this broken now
100:00 - what is going on
100:01 - hold on
100:03 - uh let's save
100:05 - close
100:06 - too many things open
100:08 - um let's try opening this
100:11 - uh no no no not now
100:13 - open with processing i want to open it
100:16 - with processing four there we go
100:20 - certainly this could be done with p5 but
100:22 - i'm
100:23 - working with processing
100:28 - and
100:29 - like what what is going on here
100:33 - what is going on on my computer
100:35 - just decide to like stop working all
100:37 - right let me open up
100:39 - just in case
100:42 - there's something going on with
100:43 - processing beta
100:45 - no
100:46 - okay thank you very much
100:53 - let me just try processing three for a
100:54 - moment
100:57 - and see
100:58 - what's going on here
101:04 - uh let's see what happens
101:07 - there we go okay
101:10 - so i don't know why some of these images
101:13 - are not working
101:15 - so weird
101:18 - so but i guess i'm not gonna
101:21 - i'm not gonna worry about that right now
101:22 - how can i do this like with a try catch
101:24 - or something
101:27 - how do i know if the image is invalid
101:43 - i just need a little error handling in
101:44 - here
101:46 - so i'm trying uh like a like a little
101:49 - try catch armor bob it's a way of like
101:53 - try this code if there was an error do
101:55 - something else
101:56 - and i'm just gonna say
102:45 - so
103:31 - okay i should be back um so uh
103:35 - for once i am prepared
103:38 - i put in i put in fresh batteries into
103:41 - my lav mic um
103:43 - i need to get good rechargeable
103:45 - batteries or a different solution
103:48 - and i don't know why but the fresh
103:49 - batteries did not make it through this
103:51 - whole stream on this one the
103:53 - the receiver is still uh oh it's very
103:56 - low
103:57 - so this receiver the fresh batteries
103:59 - didn't last well anyway i have backup
104:01 - batteries
104:02 - so but i think i better mute myself it's
104:05 - going to happen again any moment because
104:06 - this one is about to die now too i'll be
104:08 - right back
104:36 - okay so i have um
104:39 - i do have rechargeable batteries but
104:41 - they weren't lasting so i feel like
104:42 - they're quite old like i've had them for
104:44 - years so i just figured maybe i need new
104:46 - rechargeable batteries they wouldn't
104:48 - last for like a couple hours i had them
104:50 - charged up
104:51 - and i put in fresh batteries that are
104:53 - not rechargeable batteries that didn't
104:55 - last i don't know what's going on but i
104:57 - should be all okay now
104:59 - um all right
105:00 - so
105:03 - um now what is going on here
105:07 - uh let's just
105:10 - what is going on can i first of all i
105:11 - this is driving me crazy that the
105:13 - console font size is so big i'm just
105:16 - going to make that smaller
105:19 - and then
105:20 - let's get rid of this try catch
105:24 - and
105:26 - i'm going to say
105:27 - if
105:30 - if
105:32 - image
105:34 - dot i mean this is not something i
105:36 - should need to do but
105:38 - i'm just going to say if i have more
105:40 - than one pixel
105:41 - then go ahead it's a valid possible tile
105:46 - that is very strange
105:50 - oh the only reason i think it's only
105:52 - getting one image
105:55 - or no
105:56 - it's only got one image it's so strange
106:01 - oh my god what is going on
106:04 - why why does it not
106:06 - want to load these images
106:09 - i think only this last one like works
106:14 - all right hold on
106:19 - just deleting them all
106:21 - come on
106:22 - uh save at duplicate
106:26 - save as
106:28 - image one
106:30 - like i don't know what the format of
106:32 - these images that processing can't
106:33 - really like read it let's do save image
106:36 - one
106:37 - okay
106:39 - now let's see what happens here
106:49 - what is going on
106:51 - stop
106:52 - oh like
106:54 - like this should not be the complicated
106:55 - part i just have two images like just
106:58 - two test images
107:00 - image one
107:02 - dot jpeg and image2.jpg
107:05 - just two images it's all i'm asking you
107:08 - to do is load two image files
107:11 - is there
107:16 - uh okay
107:18 - so
107:19 - can i clear the console
107:24 - look it like okay quit hold on
107:27 - for the reason like like processing
107:29 - loading the bad images like everything
107:32 - dies so let's quit processing
107:37 - why must
107:39 - why do things not work oh chris you made
107:41 - it hope your meeting was good
107:43 - i mean these should just be jpegs
107:46 - okay
107:50 - okay
107:52 - here we go oh all right
107:54 - success
107:55 - so if i have two images that load
107:58 - properly
107:59 - then i will get one is darker and one is
108:02 - brighter so the darker one will
108:05 - inevitably end up trying to be the p5
108:08 - and the brighter one will and the
108:10 - brighter one will inevitably be the
108:12 - background so that makes sense because i
108:15 - have the source image that i am working
108:18 - with has a bright background and a
108:20 - darker p5 so again we're just trying to
108:22 - get like a proof of concept going
108:24 - eventually i need i would like this p5
108:26 - to look nicer i would like to use many
108:28 - many many images
108:30 - trying to get there so
108:32 - the next thing i would like to do is
108:34 - make this
108:36 - kind of full size
108:39 - so i think if i do um
108:42 - void settings
108:45 - um i can then have a size that's
108:48 - calculated
108:50 - um
108:51 - based on
108:52 - i'm just going to call this like a
108:53 - factor
108:55 - so i don't want to go all the way up to
108:57 - i just i don't want to go all the way up
108:58 - eventually i need my factor to be 10
109:00 - because i want the image that i'm going
109:02 - to produce to be this number of pixels
109:05 - but that's not going to show up really
109:06 - well for me to be able to see it so
109:08 - let's just say times factor
109:11 - times factor
109:15 - and that did not work oh because the
109:18 - image i'm loading
109:21 - the image i'm loading has to be this
109:24 - scale like i didn't write anything into
109:26 - it to account for that
109:29 - um
109:30 - [Music]
109:33 - smaller
109:34 - why am i making this
109:37 - ah
109:38 - no no
109:40 - no
109:42 - i want it based on the size of the
109:44 - window
109:46 - so i want to copy the p5 image whatever
109:49 - size it is so i want to make that larger
109:51 - i guess that's very strange
109:55 - there we go i mean there's got to be
109:56 - like a better way of doing this but now
109:58 - we can see
110:00 - um that's the thumb now the thing is i
110:03 - sort of feel like maybe i shouldn't be
110:05 - making them squares
110:09 - it's like i'm requiring it to be a
110:11 - square whereas these images but i'll
110:14 - worry about that later
110:16 - so i get 32.
110:18 - okay let's try it a factor of three
110:22 - okay uh factor of four
110:26 - all right i'm starting not to be able to
110:27 - fit it on my screen anymore but you get
110:30 - the idea
110:32 - so the improvements i need to make
110:35 - and take a screenshot of the new p5 logo
110:37 - will have more variations of gray values
110:40 - yeah
110:41 - but i think ultimately
110:43 - i don't necessarily care so much
110:47 - i think i might be able to get this to
110:48 - work by just having bright and dark ones
110:51 - and tiling them because i have so many
110:53 - thumbnails like right the thing that i
110:55 - want to do right now is what if i have
111:02 - a third
111:03 - i'm trying to think of how to approach
111:05 - this and i don't have a lot of time
111:06 - because i need to wrap this up in about
111:08 - 10 minutes so obviously i won't be
111:10 - finished with my contribution but i'm
111:12 - only getting so far uh today i'm trying
111:15 - to think of where do i want to go with
111:17 - this i think the main thing that i want
111:19 - to do is
111:23 - um
111:24 - allow myself
111:26 - i mean maybe right now actually i need
111:30 - to have a
111:31 - i just want to like threshold it
111:39 - i want to allow myself to pick multiple
111:41 - images
111:42 - so i still don't understand why
111:46 - why can't why didn't this not work to
111:48 - get multiple all like thumbnails
111:52 - um
111:54 - all right let's go back to youtube dl
111:55 - for a second
112:01 - write all the maybe i should just do
112:03 - write all thumbnails lists thumbnails
112:13 - oops
112:19 - let's see what's going on
112:26 - aha
112:28 - i see so let me just stop sometimes
112:35 - where was where is one that has the
112:37 - oh yeah so sometimes there's a format
112:40 - four
112:41 - which is max res default web p
112:46 - would this work by the way
112:48 - to say
112:50 - maxresdefault.jpg
112:54 - no
112:57 - but i could download it as web p
113:00 - and then convert it
113:02 - using but let's just get one more so i
113:05 - need to figure out getting the images
113:07 - later
113:08 - let's just get one more
113:11 - or a couple more
113:13 - image three
113:16 - and i'll convert that manually
113:21 - and i'll get one more
113:23 - let's try
113:25 - this one because it's this is good
113:26 - because it's got a very different like
113:27 - kind of brightness value
113:29 - let's call it image four
113:31 - so obviously i will oh no use webp
113:34 - um
113:36 - i will need to
113:39 - figure out some way some automatic way
113:43 - to
113:44 - duplicate
113:46 - save as
113:47 - jpeg
113:49 - image three
113:51 - i can use ffmpeg
113:54 - or some other
113:55 - [Music]
113:58 - script
113:59 - or figure out
114:07 - figure out some other way to download a
114:09 - whole get to collect a data set of
114:11 - thumbnails or maybe i actually just want
114:13 - to use screenshots from the examples
114:15 - we'll see but now i have four images so
114:18 - if i run this right now
114:22 - it's only got oh no
114:23 - it picked
114:25 - more
114:26 - than two
114:27 - amazing so it picked more than two
114:30 - because probably
114:32 - in the sort of compression of the image
114:34 - or in the in the anti-aliasing of the
114:37 - edges of the p5
114:39 - um there's like some slight variation of
114:42 - gray so that's kind of interesting
114:45 - so i guess what i could do is just make
114:47 - a much noiser but regardless
114:50 - i want to be able to right now
114:53 - i only am using one
114:56 - image per brightness value so what i
114:59 - want
115:00 - is this i want this
115:03 - bright images
115:05 - to be
115:06 - a uh
115:07 - i want for every grayscale value i want
115:10 - to have multiple choices
115:12 - so i'm going to say this is this is a
115:15 - array of arraylists
115:20 - right every image every element of the
115:23 - bright images array is a list of
115:26 - possible image options
115:28 - this is kind of nuts
115:31 - so bright images is a new array list
115:36 - of
115:38 - um image tiles
115:41 - and there are 256 of them
115:44 - no is
115:47 - arraylist image tile
115:49 - so why
115:51 - does it not like this
115:56 - what
115:58 - cannot create a generic array
116:02 - each element of this array
116:05 - is an image tile arraylist
116:08 - um
116:09 - do i need to do like this
116:13 - no
116:17 - each element is
116:24 - oh wait
116:29 - no
116:32 - how do i what's the syntax for this i'm
116:34 - looking at the chat
116:39 - how do i
116:41 - how do i make an array of arraylists
116:45 - that should be right
116:48 - like this is if this were integers
116:51 - i would say new int i mean obviously
116:53 - that doesn't work
116:54 - does not match
116:56 - java.util.array
116:59 - yeah this is right
117:03 - so why is it
117:05 - i mean
117:08 - can i just do this for a moment
117:10 - yeah so this is fine
117:16 - all right i think actually so i can do
117:19 - this
117:22 - and then i should be able to say
117:26 - for every bright images.size
117:30 - oh no no length it's still length
117:34 - bright
117:36 - images
117:37 - index i is a new arraylist
117:41 - of image tiles
117:43 - hopefully this is going to work
117:45 - yes
117:46 - and then i don't need to get
117:49 - then i just need to find every image
117:57 - i'm going to just find every image
117:58 - that's within like five
118:02 - within 10 pixels of that brightness
118:04 - value
118:06 - so that's like a threshold
118:14 - and then i don't so there's no idea of a
118:16 - record anymore like are you within and
118:19 - then i'm going to add it
118:23 - so
118:25 - no but i'm just going to add the tile
118:28 - okay so basically instead of every slide
118:32 - don't have my
118:34 - i took my phone out of there i would
118:35 - love to diagram this
118:39 - uh oh it's complaining because of the
118:40 - code at the bottom using it incorrectly
118:42 - says chris that's interesting
118:44 - oh and prothems is showing me okay okay
118:48 - so i think i might be fine anyway
118:50 - but prathamesh
118:52 - in the chat just gave me
118:55 - um
118:57 - where is it where did i do that
118:59 - arraylist
119:04 - no but that's an arraylist of arraylists
119:06 - oh you know what it is
119:09 - i think it's this
119:12 - no no all right i'm not going to worry
119:14 - about it
119:16 - because
119:18 - you should rank each image you have
119:19 - based on how close is that threshold
119:21 - then splice them out as they're used
119:24 - ah that's a great idea but i don't have
119:27 - more images than spots right now so i'll
119:30 - do that later
119:31 - because i only have three images so
119:34 - again i'm i'm really looking for people
119:36 - to help me with this throughout the day
119:38 - but i can't i don't have all day to like
119:40 - live stream i gotta
119:42 - i gotta deal with a lot of stuff and
119:44 - pick my kids up from school
119:46 - but i will be able to like come back to
119:47 - work on this in pockets so there won't
119:50 - so join the discord this is a little
119:51 - plug join the discord join the
119:53 - membership stuff all of that i'm going
119:55 - to put this on github you know my alarm
119:57 - is about to go off in about four minutes
119:58 - in my head so let me just get a little
120:00 - further with this
120:01 - so right now i'm just gonna do
120:03 - anything within 10 pixels
120:07 - is going to get added
120:09 - or within that threshold
120:11 - and then the problem is and i'm just
120:13 - going to make the threshold like 255
120:15 - right now so anything so like everything
120:18 - will get added everywhere
120:20 - so there's no holes
120:22 - and then
120:24 - when i go through
120:26 - and get the image index
120:29 - i should be able to get
120:33 - an array list
120:35 - of image tiles
120:37 - i'll call it options
120:39 - is
120:42 - from that bright image
120:45 - images array naming here is terrible
120:48 - and then
120:51 - i can say let me pick something random
120:54 - random index equals int random
120:59 - options.size
121:03 - boy welcome to java everybody
121:07 - so then my image
121:11 - the actual image is from my options
121:15 - get
121:17 - random index
121:19 - dot image
121:21 - because remember i have this image tile
121:24 - that has its brightness value which i'm
121:26 - not really using ah so i don't need that
121:28 - array
121:30 - i just have all my image tiles and i
121:32 - should go and try to find a bunch of so
121:34 - there's a lot of other ways i could do
121:35 - this because it can run really slow i
121:37 - could actually just search through the
121:39 - image tile options here but i'm running
121:41 - out of time
121:42 - so let's just
121:45 - draw oh i like by the way let's first of
121:47 - all let's just put this in here for a
121:49 - second just to see i forgot that i had
121:51 - this for debugging which was like let's
121:54 - just actually see what i'm working with
121:55 - here this is actually what i'm working
121:57 - with here so you can see there's very
121:58 - minimal grayscale
122:00 - kind of options but
122:02 - something to start with now let's put
122:04 - the uh image oh
122:06 - let's put the images in let's see if
122:08 - this works
122:10 - this is the random image that i picked
122:11 - now this should look just totally like a
122:13 - mess
122:14 - because i made the threshold 255 so i
122:17 - only have three image options and i'm
122:20 - getting a random one for every tile
122:22 - and i think now if i make the threshold
122:26 - so ideally i want the threshold to be
122:28 - like five but i think i'm going to get
122:30 - errors
122:31 - because
122:32 - not every brightness value is going to
122:35 - have an image within five pixels of it
122:38 - so right again i have to work on this
122:40 - more today so many ways to improve it
122:43 - but let's just kind of like
122:46 - see like how
122:48 - on what threshold will get me there
122:52 - uh let's try 50
122:57 - 150
122:59 - there we go there see
123:01 - 150 kind of got me there again this is
123:03 - not a thoughtful way of doing this
123:05 - but i got it
123:07 - i mean so now i just need a lot more
123:09 - images a better interesting more source
123:12 - image and i think i'm i'm on my way and
123:15 - if i had another hour to live stream
123:18 - i would keep going with that so because
123:19 - i don't
123:21 - i'm going to do the following
123:23 - let's go to github
123:28 - and please be logged in
123:31 - so please bear with me
123:34 - as i log into github it's only going to
123:36 - take me about 45 minutes with all of my
123:38 - oh that's nice that i had that saved
123:41 - i need
123:43 - my two factor
123:46 - um so let me just do this for a second
123:53 - authenticator
123:57 - this actually is not taking that long
124:01 - i am verified i am in
124:04 - i am going to make
124:08 - a new repo
124:11 - we're calling this
124:13 - coding train processing
124:16 - or coding train
124:18 - we'll just call this processing
124:20 - catalog
124:22 - contribution
124:25 - uh my
124:26 - coding train
124:28 - processing
124:29 - community
124:31 - catalog
124:32 - contribution
124:35 - uh add a readme file choose a license
124:38 - right now i mean
124:40 - i've lots of thoughts about licenses but
124:42 - i'm just going to do this
124:47 - let us go ahead and bring this down
124:57 - i'm going to say i'm going to clone that
124:59 - repo
125:02 - i'm going to open up my folder here and
125:05 - bring this into it
125:10 - oops
125:16 - it's really loud
125:19 - i need a git ignore file i'm going to
125:22 - use nano which is a little
125:24 - text editor that i can put in here
125:29 - um
125:31 - okay
125:38 - i mean i really should ignore the jpegs
125:40 - but i need some sample ones
125:42 - so
125:43 - it's going to upload with these
125:48 - okay
125:49 - so
125:52 - um
125:53 - everything is here let me let me make
125:55 - some issues of things that i need to do
125:57 - a better
125:59 - source image
126:01 - what should the overall
126:03 - design be
126:06 - like maybe also a coding train character
126:12 - so i could try something like that
126:14 - uh
126:15 - you know like
126:16 - post
126:17 - links to your ideas
126:20 - here
126:20 - and just remember the dimensions should
126:23 - be
126:24 - um
126:26 - basically
126:27 - this 225 by
126:29 - aspect ratio oops
126:35 - aspect
126:36 - ratio is
126:40 - 225 by 300
126:43 - okay
126:44 - so that's one thing now the other thing
126:46 - is
126:48 - what uh database
126:50 - of images
126:52 - should it be all thumbnails
126:58 - would love help downloading them all
127:03 - you know post i'm sorry this is very
127:06 - hard for you to see um
127:08 - post your
127:10 - youtube dl command sequence commands
127:14 - here
127:15 - or
127:16 - links to a drive or dropbox etc folder
127:21 - of images
127:23 - thank you these are things i need help
127:25 - with but
127:29 - another idea i have another idea is
127:34 - another idea
127:37 - maybe
127:38 - the images shouldn't be
127:41 - thumbnails
127:43 - but
127:44 - actual
127:45 - uh snapshots of sketches themselves
127:51 - which can be configured
127:54 - to conform
127:56 - to a color for any given pixel
128:00 - i'm not sure if that makes any sense
128:03 - but
128:05 - in other words
128:07 - oh my camera went out oh so sad
128:12 - everything is falling apart here at the
128:14 - end
128:15 - um
128:15 - [Music]
128:17 - um
128:19 - all right so what am i going to do here
128:21 - i so little time just going to
128:24 - just going to let the camera charge up a
128:25 - little bit i'm definitely going to have
128:27 - to be more mindful of making sure my
128:28 - camera is fully charged for whatever
128:31 - reason the power i have it plugged into
128:33 - is not enough to keep it on
128:37 - and i'm just going to go to here for a
128:38 - second so just listen to me talk
128:40 - so
128:42 - my idea here is that maybe
128:47 - and someone could please post this to
128:49 - the youtube chat and oh my god it's so
128:51 - loud
128:52 - um
128:53 - maybe
128:55 - lawn mowers and the boiler is going here
128:57 - in the garage so much going on where is
128:59 - gloria um
129:02 - i really have to stop
129:04 - maybe
129:07 - maybe i just keep saying maybe over and
129:10 - over again like my brain will start
129:11 - working
129:12 - uh
129:14 - you know we could actually run i could
129:16 - just run a lot of sketches and have them
129:19 - be very specific colors and create a
129:22 - huge database of images that way i could
129:24 - even name them with their rgb values
129:26 - there's lots of possibilities here
129:29 - so if you would like to contribute to
129:30 - this and i'm hoping that even just
129:32 - giving it like a minute will allow me to
129:34 - wrap up this live stream
129:36 - um
129:38 - if you would like to contribute to this
129:40 - you don't need to do a pull request
129:43 - you certainly could but you know you can
129:46 - set i'm i'm i'm really going to be
129:47 - paying attention to this today so you
129:50 - could just post your ideas or quick
129:52 - little algorithms in the issues um you
129:54 - could do a pull request with an entirely
129:57 - additional folder with a sketch so i
129:59 - don't know how easy it is going to be to
130:01 - like
130:01 - take incremental community improvements
130:04 - to just this one sketch and who knows if
130:07 - anybody's actually interested in helping
130:09 - make this today
130:11 - so i'm just going to work on it on my
130:12 - own and think just do the best that i
130:13 - can
130:14 - but um uh you know just stay in touch
130:17 - and that's my plug here for you to join
130:19 - the discord um so the discord is a place
130:23 - where you can get help and ask questions
130:26 - um there's a there's a set of like
130:28 - supporter channels if you sign up for a
130:30 - youtube membership but um
130:32 - actually the main thing that i want to
130:33 - highlight here is the coding train
130:35 - website is going under a major
130:37 - transformation a really exciting project
130:40 - that probably won't launch until like
130:42 - january but um we're looking for a lot
130:45 - of feedback and user testing of the new
130:47 - sites rather than trying to decide like
130:49 - what kind of language to use and we're
130:51 - getting feedback about different design
130:52 - ideas so please join i mean one thing i
130:56 - just want to say is like let's put this
130:58 - link somebody please
131:00 - post this the link to this form in the
131:02 - youtube chat right now but join the
131:04 - discord to stay tuned for notifications
131:07 - about the website fill out this form
131:08 - it'll take you literally like 30 seconds
131:10 - to answer a few questions about naming
131:13 - i really would like your feedback on
131:15 - that um so i just wanted to mention that
131:17 - before i go and while some of you are
131:19 - still here watching and
131:22 - uh
131:24 - uh
131:26 - profit mesh is giving me more ideas
131:29 - about how to to get the syntax of
131:31 - arraylist arraylist i will work on that
131:34 - offline so i think that's pretty much
131:36 - everything i have to say today i'm sorry
131:38 - to be like rushing out of here um
131:41 - eventually things will change and uh
131:44 - well um you know i'm just i'm learning
131:45 - as i go i've been doing this for years
131:47 - still feel like i'm not doing it right
131:49 - uh new nature of code videos coming out
131:52 - next live stream
131:54 - it won't be this coming monday almost
131:56 - certainly but it'll be a week from today
131:58 - or a week in a few days from today it'll
131:59 - be either be mondays and fridays morning
132:02 - that's when i'll be live streaming
132:04 - i'm gonna sit just sort of look at the
132:05 - chat for a minute as i kind of clean up
132:07 - here and put on some music to say
