10:03 - that's the sponsor for today but i'll
10:05 - mention that in a second
10:07 - uh
10:08 - hello everyone welcome to
10:13 - the coding train
10:15 - on yet another
10:16 - friday
10:18 - my name is dan i'm coming to you live
10:21 - from a snowstorm in the hudson valley i
10:23 - am taking a peek over here on my monitor
10:26 - to see that my audio is going um
10:30 - and i just want to make sure that
10:32 - everybody five by five audio sounds
10:35 - great yes this is a brand new microphone
10:39 - it is a high-end lavalier microphone
10:42 - with a
10:44 - receiver with giant antenna on them if i
10:47 - wander far away
10:48 - uh
10:49 - over to my whiteboard over here first of
10:53 - all i would like to point out to you
10:54 - it's very hard for you to see but this
10:56 - uh hello over here um
10:59 - the white you see outside is not is snow
11:03 - covering the yard
11:05 - uh oh no my um
11:07 - i have this
11:09 - thing of cardboard
11:10 - taped over a window over there to deal
11:13 - with this reflection here just would you
11:15 - mind would you let me put on some music
11:17 - for you i'm gonna get started with the
11:19 - whole coding train thing but this is
11:22 - really gonna bother me i just i i've had
11:24 - so many issues with getting set up today
11:27 - and it's really going to bother me if if
11:30 - that's an issue so i'm just going to
11:32 - walk over here
11:34 - i'm going to go back to this scene which
11:37 - is me
11:39 - i'm going to press this i'm going to
11:41 - play you the the full this dot song
11:43 - while i go and fix that glare issue
11:44 - ready enjoy as always get up and dance
11:47 - all right you're at home you can do it
11:48 - come on
11:50 - everybody stand up
11:54 - all right uh my audio still should be
11:56 - going through i'm just wandering over
11:57 - here i'm getting some tape
12:00 - nice giant piece of cardboard
12:03 - taped up
12:04 - this stop this dot in front of this
12:06 - window
12:11 - [Music]
12:31 - [Music]
12:35 - one of the worst jobs
12:50 - hopefully this is gonna hold
12:52 - i'm sure it's gonna fall down for me and
12:54 - regret this sort of terrible job i just
12:56 - did if i could just get one more piece
12:57 - of tape but you know that thing that
12:59 - happens to you when the tape
13:02 - gets like sort of stuck and then uh and
13:04 - then you rip it and then like sort of
13:05 - only half the tape is coming
13:07 - this is happening to me right now in the
13:09 - most
13:10 - horrifically terrible way okay i think
13:13 - a little little tape peeling asmr for
13:16 - you all today on a friday is it snowing
13:19 - where any of you are it is a nice big
13:21 - snowstorm my kids are home from school
13:24 - thus the uh pushing back the start time
13:27 - for a half an hour
13:28 - and i don't know i don't know how this
13:30 - is gonna go i i usually have a nice
13:33 - quiet
13:35 - if i'm going to start streaming at 10 30
13:36 - i usually have a nice quiet
13:38 - um
13:40 - hour to an hour and a half to get ready
13:42 - and i had about 15 minutes
13:45 - which made me realize like i could not
13:46 - possibly start at 10 30 and so i started
13:50 - at well 11 now it's like 11 20 and i i
13:52 - have like a very high degree of
13:54 - difficulty
13:56 - um
13:57 - problem
13:58 - to work on today i'm back
14:03 - before i get too far into this mess uh
14:05 - let me take a moment to thank uh today's
14:07 - sponsor today's sponsor is a new sponsor
14:10 - um ai camp um and um so i'm i'm not as
14:14 - fluid in my what i'm about to say to you
14:17 - i'm going to do a little bit of reading
14:18 - from here but um what i want to tell you
14:20 - about ai camp's mission so ai camp
14:23 - aicamp avoids the pitfalls of
14:25 - traditional higher education through
14:26 - enabling our their students to learn
14:29 - through doing to facilitate their
14:31 - progress they provide immersive
14:33 - project-based programs that cater to the
14:35 - students goals and interests while
14:36 - teaching them the skills they need to be
14:38 - self-sufficient and industry ready
14:40 - our company infrastructure was
14:42 - originally built by a world-class team
14:44 - of experienced educators and seasoned
14:46 - industry professionals
14:48 - and now their operations many of their
14:50 - operations are being managed by several
14:52 - teenagers that have excelled during the
14:53 - programs and gone on to work
14:55 - for ai camp and in industry as
14:57 - developers and leaders so you can find
14:59 - out everything you want to know about ai
15:01 - camp at ai dash camp.org go to slash
15:05 - mission for their mission but this link
15:07 - here will take you if you are between
15:10 - the ages of 13 and 18 that link will
15:12 - take you to a scholarship application
15:14 - for their summer programs um it can be
15:16 - done fairly quickly in one sitting
15:19 - last summer they gave 10 of the students
15:21 - a full scholarship and about 60 of the
15:24 - students a partial scholarship so if
15:26 - you're looking if you're uh you know
15:28 - i've been i'm going to show you some
15:29 - more stuff from their website some of
15:31 - the projects that students have built
15:32 - later but if you are looking for
15:33 - something to do this summer uh virtual
15:36 - summer camp with ai camp um
15:38 - please check them out and you can apply
15:41 - for a scholarship through this link that
15:43 - i'm showing you right there
15:45 - all right
15:48 - now uh
15:52 - okay um
15:54 - um rico loic rico i see you sent me a
15:57 - message i don't have time to read the
15:58 - full paragraph of text but i appreciate
16:00 - it
16:04 - i am just as organized as i always am
16:06 - with my list of things to talk about
16:09 - today
16:11 - this is your first time tuning in
16:13 - welcome
16:14 - what i am intending to do today is
16:17 - record well i'm going to be live
16:19 - streaming but while i'm live streaming
16:21 - and please everybody needs to remind me
16:23 - about this when it gets the time for me
16:25 - to start the coding challenge that i
16:27 - intend to execute today everybody should
16:29 - say like hey dan did you remember to
16:32 - press record to disk
16:34 - because if i don't then
16:37 - i don't know
16:38 - it's just going to live in the live
16:39 - stream but the this new process that
16:41 - i've got going on and i just want to um
16:46 - sorry minimize some windows here oh boy
16:50 - i don't know what i'm looking at but
16:53 - oh i shouldn't have closed these windows
16:55 - some of them i wanted but i'm going to
16:56 - go to my youtube channel here and i'm
16:59 - going to press this button
17:01 - and so and i'm going to go over to
17:03 - videos so these um
17:06 - this is what you're watching right now
17:08 - me live
17:09 - um and most recently i released um this
17:13 - ascii video coding challenge this prime
17:16 - number spiral coding challenge and both
17:19 - of these are act actually occur during a
17:22 - live stream and then and they take
17:24 - probably well over an hour um and then
17:28 - during after the live stream i work with
17:30 - a team of a team
17:32 - huge massive production crew
17:35 - of editors thank you matia and
17:37 - illustrators thank you to jason and many
17:39 - other people who contribute um to put
17:41 - together these kind of edited um
17:44 - versions with some animations and
17:45 - additional references and more examples
17:48 - and that's what you're seeing here in
17:49 - the prime spiral video and the ascii
17:51 - vidi video coding challenge um
17:54 - i don't want to press the record button
17:56 - yet unbound
17:58 - i because i don't want to waste i mean i
18:00 - guess i really probably should record
18:01 - everything i ever do i should record
18:03 - which i should just record the vast
18:05 - archive that is the coding train should
18:07 - always be recorded but i kind of just
18:09 - leave these live streams up
18:11 - i should press record though um
18:15 - so one thing i wanted to say is that
18:16 - these videos
18:18 - have done better at least in their first
18:21 - few days or first week than anything
18:23 - that i've released in quite a while so i
18:25 - kind of feel like maybe i have
18:27 - after 10 some
18:29 - some 10 years of doing this and some 20
18:31 - plus years of kind of teaching
18:34 - found something uh in terms of how to
18:37 - put together the live streams and the
18:38 - coding the coding challenges together
18:41 - so thank you for all of you who've been
18:43 - watching those and providing excellent
18:45 - feedback one thing i wanted to mention
18:47 - is this one the slide puzzle challenge
18:50 - here
18:51 - which was from three weeks ago i've been
18:52 - trying to do these you can see three
18:54 - weeks ago two weeks ago and then about
18:56 - uh one week ago five days ago i've been
18:59 - trying to get them every week although
19:00 - there isn't one ready for this week so
19:02 - uh
19:03 - three per month that's about what's
19:05 - happening um but this one didn't really
19:07 - seem to catch on uh i did just swap out
19:10 - the thumbnail so that's a new thumbnail
19:12 - and i added the word in javascript to
19:15 - the title maybe that will
19:17 - register more for people's radars but
19:19 - this one
19:20 - didn't seem to catch on in the same way
19:22 - as the ascii video one and this prime
19:25 - spiral and i don't think it's the topic
19:27 - but i could be wrong about that
19:28 - obviously because i don't
19:30 - have any real data to back that up so if
19:32 - you missed that video uh you know add to
19:34 - watch later check it out if you want i
19:36 - mean certainly if you're not interested
19:38 - please don't watch it just to
19:40 - to torture yourself my goodness would
19:42 - not want you to do that
19:44 - um
19:45 - thank you peter there is i'm being told
19:47 - there's a green screen issue but i don't
19:50 - see it on my monitor over here
19:57 - um okay so the next thing that i want to
20:00 - do here i talked about ai camp um two
20:03 - things i want to do before i get to well
20:06 - there's three i have three kind of
20:08 - uh quick things on my list before i get
20:10 - to the uh coding challenge for today the
20:12 - mandelbald coldy challenge just give you
20:13 - the full agenda
20:15 - i want to look at some community
20:16 - contributions which ah sorry i want to
20:18 - look at the passenger showcase
20:20 - it's now called the passenger showcase
20:23 - i know somebody at showcase station was
20:25 - the suggestion from last week but i've
20:27 - rebranded it a passenger showcase i want
20:29 - to look at some passenger showcase i
20:31 - want to look at some of your comments on
20:33 - the prime spiral video i want to just
20:35 - alert you to coding train social media
20:37 - and some of the things we're featuring
20:38 - for black history month
20:40 - then i intend to do the mandelbulb
20:43 - coding challenge which is going to be
20:44 - really hard i should try to get started
20:46 - with that as soon as possible while i
20:48 - have some fresh energy
20:50 - and uh then also
20:53 - nature of code 2.5 let's see if i can
20:56 - continue that end body simulation that
20:58 - i've been working on for that next
20:59 - nature of code tutorial
21:01 - and somewhere in there
21:03 - i am also going to talk to you again
21:05 - about ai camp let me just remind you uh
21:08 - today's sponsor ai camp thank you very
21:10 - much
21:11 - um
21:12 - and there whoops all these buttons i
21:14 - can't manage to do it okay so let's go
21:18 - i mean i wonder if i should just get
21:20 - going with the coding challenge and then
21:22 - come back to the passenger showcase the
21:25 - comments you know what i'm going to do
21:27 - that today let's see how that works
21:28 - because the the mandelbulb coding
21:31 - challenge i think is a very high degree
21:33 - of difficulty one relative to some of
21:35 - the things i've tried more recently
21:39 - and so i think it might take longer
21:43 - i might get more stuck than usual i
21:45 - don't even know if i'm going to succeed
21:47 - at this
21:48 - this might be very far on the sca
21:50 - spectrum of train wreck we've got train
21:53 - wreck and gravy train i don't know what
21:55 - these are i think the ascii one was kind
21:57 - of gravy train and this one was like in
21:59 - the middle between train wreck and gravy
22:01 - train
22:02 - i don't know
22:03 - i don't know if that's a real rating
22:04 - system that i can use so i think i would
22:07 - like to get started with that then i
22:09 - will talk to you about ai camp the
22:11 - sponsor and then i'll come back and in
22:13 - the second half of the stream i can go
22:15 - through some community stuff passenger
22:17 - showcase see if i can get back to nature
22:19 - of code that kind of stuff how does that
22:20 - sound to all of you
22:22 - top right corner of your camera capture
22:24 - ah yes thank you i see it now
22:27 - um let me iron that out that will really
22:30 - bother me first of all let's just take a
22:31 - look at the whiteboard that glare is
22:33 - gone awesome
22:35 - um let me see if i can see it yes it's
22:37 - easier for me so it's this light i think
22:40 - if i just turn this light
22:42 - it's not pointed as directly at me but i
22:44 - think the lighting is still fine and now
22:45 - it's not there thank you for
22:48 - um
22:49 - there
22:51 - and i am doing the mandelbulb in
22:53 - processing yes i mean i might
22:55 - investigate at the end if i could do it
22:57 - in p5 and i also should let you all know
23:00 - just in advance before you get too
23:02 - excited that my goal with the manual
23:04 - bulb is just to do a point cloud of the
23:06 - mandel bulb fractal so i don't believe
23:09 - that i'm necessarily going to like
23:11 - create the mesh and texture it and light
23:14 - it and all that stuff that sort of that
23:16 - could be at some point like a part two
23:18 - or another live stream or but i'm really
23:20 - leaving that up to the viewer i want to
23:22 - look at the math of the mandelbulb see
23:24 - how that's implemented
23:26 - get a version of it that i can see in
23:28 - processing and kind of go from there i
23:31 - also want to look at saving the date i
23:33 - want to look at saving the data out that
23:35 - way it could import it into i don't know
23:37 - i don't know any of these things like
23:39 - blender but i was thinking i've used
23:40 - like like over five five plus years ago
23:42 - i think i used mesh lab once um so i
23:44 - might download mesh lab and try that all
23:47 - right
23:49 - so let me find the references that i
23:50 - want which i literally just closed which
23:53 - is quite unfortunate mandel bulb but oh
23:56 - they're still uh over here so well let
23:58 - me go to the wikipedia page always a
24:00 - good starting point
24:02 - um
24:04 - let me find the references
24:06 - uh this i believe is oh
24:09 - no this is interesting this is not one
24:11 - of the references i meant to
24:13 - open let's see
24:15 - um let's see this
24:19 - yes this is the one that i intend to use
24:23 - as my primary
24:24 - reference i want to just see
24:28 - i think
24:30 - or maybe this is not it where is the one
24:32 - all right hold on
24:33 - this is a good reference oh yeah
24:36 - uh background
24:40 - no i there was a page i was looking at
24:42 - yesterday that had
24:45 - i thought it was this page the formulas
24:47 - on it and even some pseudo code
24:55 - okay maybe it's this
24:57 - and maybe it's
24:58 - this
25:00 - this is not
25:01 - this is good reference
25:05 - yeah this is definitely
25:06 - uh something that i should
25:10 - read in terms of the history i have not
25:11 - seen this one
25:15 - whoa
25:19 - uh yeah so hold on where is the one that
25:22 - i was looking at yesterday let me keep
25:24 - looking
25:27 - um
25:29 - i thought it was this page hold on
25:32 - formula no mandelbulb
25:45 - this was a good reference
25:48 - too um
25:56 - yeah this is the original
25:58 - i want to get the historical references
26:00 - correct
26:19 - i want to do the romanesco broccoli
26:22 - where was this page that i was looking
26:24 - at
26:25 - yesterday when i was reading up on it
26:27 - that had published the formula
26:31 - no this okay i mean i can use this is
26:33 - this the original
26:35 - publishing of the formula that would be
26:36 - good to reference
26:38 - 2007.
26:45 - i think this might have been the one i
26:47 - was looking at
26:48 - i'm really losing my mind here
26:52 - okay
26:54 - let me take a look at the chat no i
26:56 - didn't start the recording yet
26:59 - i'm going to
27:01 - uh okay
27:02 - i'm going to just
27:04 - look a little more carefully here
27:05 - because i was
27:06 - scanning this very quickly
27:09 - full size shown here other hot spots
27:12 - here
27:13 - okay
27:15 - order eight is what i'm going to do
27:24 - um
27:32 - okay
27:34 - we're looking for
27:38 - just
27:43 - those are the images
27:49 - yes this is the page i'm looking for
27:52 - just have to keep scrolling
27:54 - no where
27:59 - okay
28:01 - this is crazy
28:03 - like last night i found a webpage i
28:06 - thought it was this web page
28:08 - that had
28:09 - i mean i don't necessarily need it
28:11 - because i'm finding the same info but i
28:13 - felt like it was
28:19 - last wrote
28:24 - introduction existence
28:32 - uh
28:33 - this is not what the page looked like i
28:36 - think okay so if you will um
28:45 - and never stream your chrome history uh
28:48 - if you will
28:52 - bear with me for a moment
28:56 - i really want to find this link
28:58 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
29:00 - just switch to this view and i'm going
29:02 - to log out of so one of the things
29:05 - speaking of pro tips for streaming is i
29:07 - have
29:08 - um
29:09 - multiple accounts
29:13 - on this computer
29:14 - and i stream from one of them
29:19 - um
29:20 - please raise the sensitivity of the mic
29:22 - so i'm loathe to do that if somebody uh
29:26 - it does seem a tiny bit quiet actually
29:28 - let me try doing this
29:31 - um
29:32 - let's see how that let's see how that
29:34 - does but i tend to get quite a bit loud
29:37 - and also once i turn the
29:39 - noise down so just give me a moment here
29:41 - i am now logging into the login that i
29:44 - was
29:45 - um
29:48 - uh last night when i was reading some
29:50 - articles about the mandelbrot sorry
29:52 - manual bulb before
29:55 - um
29:57 - and here it is
29:58 - it's on skytopia
30:02 - skytopia.com project slash fractal
30:05 - to
30:06 - mandelbulb.html i'll even show you
30:10 - uh even though i'm kind of like this is
30:12 - uh this is the page that i was looking
30:13 - at last night with these formulas that i
30:15 - wanted to use as my main reference
30:18 - and i don't know why i wasn't finding it
30:22 - this is the same page
30:24 - i'm losing my mind oh no this is a
30:26 - slightly different one okay
30:28 - i'm just gonna
30:31 - i'm putting um
30:34 - hold on
30:40 - okay so i'm just showing you this
30:42 - everybody can see this url this is the
30:44 - url
30:47 - um that i want to look at everybody see
30:50 - it so i'm now going to go back
30:52 - to this view and i'm logging back out of
30:55 - daniel shiffman i'm no longer daniel
30:57 - shiffman
30:58 - and i'm logging into codingtrain i am
31:00 - now the coding train
31:05 - this will take a moment
31:07 - we're going to get there
31:11 - i'm logging in as the coding trait now i
31:13 - need to go back to that url can somebody
31:15 - please
31:16 - remind me
31:18 - um um oh and i see matia is just there
31:22 - in the chat let me know how the audio
31:24 - sounds i mean everybody should let me
31:26 - know but in particular about you as the
31:28 - sort of lead
31:29 - um
31:32 - lead um
31:34 - video editor i don't know what title to
31:35 - give you mattia the the coding train
31:37 - would not exist without mattia in the
31:39 - form that it does today i mean probably
31:40 - it wouldn't exist without me also you
31:42 - know i do have something to contribute
31:44 - here but really the the the amount of
31:47 - support i get from the community and
31:48 - different people who work on various
31:50 - projects is just extraordinary okay
31:53 - now can everybody help me
31:55 - let me just
31:56 - close out of some stuff here that i
31:58 - don't want
31:59 - to pop up okay that doesn't matter
32:02 - um
32:04 - i'm going here i'm going to
32:07 - lot links and then
32:09 - just trying to clean up my i have to do
32:11 - some stuff to clean up my desktop
32:16 - alright you know what
32:20 - ah
32:22 - that's fine i'm quitting discord i'm not
32:23 - gonna be showing discord today
32:25 - quitting this
32:27 - quitting this
32:29 - and now i'm back
32:31 - all right so let's see if we can find
32:32 - that link so
32:34 - aha so it was what was it it was like
32:36 - one mandal bulb or something i've
32:38 - already forgotten
32:43 - no
32:44 - four mandolin what was it somebody
32:46 - remind me tell me in the chat
32:49 - i can't paste the link there i have too
32:51 - many computers going all over the place
32:54 - um come on chat people help me out what
32:58 - was it
32:59 - for mandelbulb
33:01 - no
33:03 - fractal
33:04 - ah okay
33:06 - look
33:07 - we're finding it
33:13 - no
33:16 - i'm losing my mind
33:18 - what was that page
33:20 - was it this page
33:24 - two two thank you i couldn't remember
33:27 - that two
33:29 - it's hard getting older folks i i really
33:31 - feel like um
33:34 - i hope i can keep this coding train
33:36 - thing going all right to mandelbulb
33:39 - all right yes this is the page that i
33:41 - want
33:42 - this is so weird because look at this
33:45 - timestamp i'm losing my mind here
33:47 - timestamp
33:50 - 8 11 2009.
33:52 - and then if i go to
33:54 - [Music]
33:57 - this one
33:59 - same like
34:01 - these pages look remarkably similar
34:04 - this one has been updated in 2011
34:08 - and this one was not
34:10 - so i as i am this is coding train
34:12 - classic
34:15 - where i very much like to
34:17 - um
34:19 - stick with the classics here this is the
34:21 - page that i'm going to use as the
34:22 - reference fantastic okay we are good
34:28 - um i do want to take a moment so let's
34:31 - see what else i've got here
34:36 - so i'm going to just close out
34:40 - some of these other tabs oops
34:47 - getting myself set up i'm going to hit
34:48 - record in a minute
34:50 - obviously this i want to
34:52 - just have a better understanding of the
34:54 - history here
34:56 - uh and let me minimize this i'm going to
34:58 - show you all this later the ai camp
35:00 - stuff deep breath
35:08 - constructed
35:09 - for the first time in 97 by jules reese
35:12 - in 2009 further developed by daniel
35:15 - white and paul nylander using spherical
35:17 - coordinates
35:18 - okay
35:20 - all right so here's the other thing i
35:22 - wanted to mention to you the viewers and
35:24 - i'll i'm going to be repeating myself in
35:25 - a moment when i start to
35:28 - kind of
35:29 - get into the coding challenge itself but
35:32 - let me i want to pull these up so
35:34 - mandelbrot coding challenge
35:40 - so
35:41 - i do have from
35:43 - uh what is
35:45 - getting close to six years ago now
35:48 - um
35:50 - okay fine i'm just gonna start hitting
35:51 - i'm gonna hit record to disc because
35:53 - it's too much danger of me forgetting so
35:56 - let me just take care of that real fast
36:01 - if you'll bear with me i'm going to say
36:03 - remind me later
36:05 - [Music]
36:07 - and this looks like it is good to go so
36:10 - i'm going to hit start recording
36:13 - so i am now recording to disk
36:16 - i have all my chat and other things up
36:19 - that i'm taking a look at
36:21 - um all right so things are things are
36:23 - recording now but i'm still not into the
36:26 - intro yet
36:27 - so this is a coding challenge um that i
36:30 - did uh almost six years ago i watched
36:33 - this actually last night which is a
36:34 - little odd feel i watched a 2x but i
36:36 - watched this one back to help me prepare
36:38 - for doing this
36:41 - and then i also watched
36:44 - spherical geometry
36:46 - coding challenge coding train
36:50 - this one back
36:52 - at 2x which is also necessary and this
36:56 - was also this was done these are these
36:58 - happened in quick succession so these
37:00 - were just a couple weeks ago it was
37:01 - interesting to watch these
37:03 - because
37:04 - um you know i'm really i do think a lot
37:07 - about now
37:08 - about that uh continuum between
37:12 - raw unedited coding
37:15 - and sort of like
37:17 - edited scored
37:20 - uh animated overlays uh
37:23 - coding so uh it's interesting to watch
37:26 - these but surprisingly what i think was
37:28 - so what i didn't like about watching
37:30 - these back is there were these like long
37:33 - i'm talking about i had like a pain in
37:35 - my side so that kind of stuff off it
37:37 - doesn't make it into the videos now
37:40 - so there is there's some authenticity to
37:42 - the sort of chatter that's in these that
37:44 - i quite enjoyed and i wonder if like my
37:46 - like
37:47 - there's such a different color i i got
37:50 - to think about i don't i don't know how
37:51 - to do my camera settings but i'm sure
37:53 - it's fine um
37:56 - so
37:58 - um but what was interesting about
37:59 - watching this is there were some just
38:00 - rapid cuts that were like okay i'm back
38:03 - i did a lot of debugging for the last
38:04 - half an hour and this is what i figured
38:06 - out whereas now even though there is a
38:09 - lot of stuff cut out um i i try to like
38:12 - have things be sped up or keep the more
38:14 - of the debugging time but put like lots
38:16 - of jump cuts in it in order to kind of
38:19 - create this sort of full story because i
38:21 - was watching it was a little bit jarring
38:23 - your eyes like i have no idea what just
38:24 - happened and how you figured that out so
38:27 - um okay so the mandelbrot set i'm going
38:30 - to refer to the spherical geometry stuff
38:32 - i'm going to refer to
38:34 - so i also need i need those formula
38:38 - formulae
38:39 - mandel brat set
38:45 - um
38:48 - okay so this is what i'm doing
38:51 - and then
38:53 - the spherical coordinates
38:58 - i want those formula
39:02 - which
39:04 - uh
39:05 - is here
39:08 - this is what i'm looking for
39:09 - interestingly enough
39:10 - yeah this is what i was expecting to see
39:12 - so
39:13 - this is what i want okay great
39:17 - all right let's also get something out
39:18 - of the way
39:20 - um
39:23 - what
39:24 - is the proper pronunciation for
39:29 - this
39:30 - i believe the proper greek pronunciation
39:33 - of the greek letter is fee
39:41 - um but
39:42 - i often hear it pronounced as phi in a
39:44 - sort of like more informal like way
39:47 - or incorrect way i guess there's another
39:50 - way of putting that i think i want to
39:52 - say fee
39:53 - am i going to
39:55 - and by the way this is totally i think
39:57 - like
39:58 - 20 minutes on this in the spherical
40:00 - coding challenge so if anybody who feels
40:02 - strongly about the pronunciation
40:06 - you know writing f-p-h-i
40:09 - is not helpful to me fee everyone is
40:11 - saying fee
40:12 - fee according to wikipedia fee okay fee
40:15 - fi fo thumb okay so i'm gonna say fee
40:19 - so that's out of the way
40:21 - i also just want to acknowledge i people
40:23 - are i see in the chat or making some
40:25 - comments and references to current
40:27 - events i am aware of kind of the horror
40:30 - that's going on in the world the war
40:31 - that is happening um i am choosing to
40:33 - focus on the coding train with that put
40:36 - to the side today that's a a form of
40:38 - privilege that i am able to do that but
40:41 - um i just you know since some people
40:43 - were mentioning it in the chat i wanted
40:44 - to just make a quick acknowledgement and
40:46 - if anybody is
40:47 - sort of suffering and having uh
40:49 - difficulty due to the events like i i
40:52 - feel for you i hope that this coding
40:54 - train stream if you're able to if you're
40:57 - able to watch it is something that can
40:59 - uh improve your day although i recognize
41:01 - it probably can't
41:03 - okay so that's all i have to say about
41:04 - that
41:06 - and i'm going to find a whiteboard
41:09 - marker
41:10 - and
41:12 - just make sure that the whiteboard stuff
41:14 - is going i'm also going to turn off the
41:15 - heaters
41:16 - so that the audio is a little bit better
41:18 - quality
41:22 - i also feel like i need a tissue which i
41:24 - have now found
41:26 - but i prefer to mute my microphone
41:28 - before i blow my nose
41:51 - okay my mic is back uh simon i see your
41:54 - comments about how i botched my
41:56 - explanation of imaginary numbers in the
41:58 - mathematics set i was feeling a lot of
42:00 - pain watching that back yesterday so
42:03 - thank you for that reminder
42:05 - let me just
42:06 - write over here
42:08 - to make sure i have the whiteboard
42:10 - focused
42:13 - can i push this back at all it's all the
42:15 - way back
42:19 - and i just want to see if the focus is
42:22 - good
42:23 - there's a way for me to zoom but i think
42:24 - i'm just going to have to do my best
42:26 - here
42:27 - you know what actually there's an easier
42:28 - way for me to do this if i stand back
42:30 - here
42:32 - apologies i'm just focusing the camera
42:36 - gosh it's really hard for me to tell
42:39 - um
42:41 - but i guess
42:44 - that's going to be good enough and
42:47 - it's a little bit
42:56 - that's a little better lighting-wise i
42:57 - think
43:00 - just made it darker but i don't know
43:02 - maybe i should oh you know what i know i
43:03 - remember why i don't do that because
43:06 - it's pulling the brightness from behind
43:08 - it's a little bit backlit okay
43:10 - that should be good
43:12 - um how does this look to everybody
43:15 - i think that looks good i can go check
43:17 - it over here
43:21 - yep
43:24 - okay uh
43:29 - all right
43:30 - so
43:38 - is this four okay
43:51 - okay so mattia just as a note
43:56 - this is the this is the reference image
43:58 - that we'll start with
44:00 - um because this is precisely the version
44:03 - that i hope to create now mind you again
44:05 - to the live audience here what i intend
44:06 - to create will not look anything like
44:08 - this although i would like to get to
44:10 - there
44:11 - i would like to render it with like
44:13 - but that'll have to be another
44:15 - i mean i'm just gonna be happy if i get
44:17 - anything remotely close okay
44:22 - then
44:24 - what was the other
44:27 - thing that i ah yes processing so let's
44:30 - make sure i think
44:32 - i am using the most recent version of
44:34 - processing
44:36 - beta six
44:37 - i think that's what i've got let's open
44:39 - let's run this one
44:43 - how can i
44:45 - tell um
44:56 - for oh no i'm in beta 5. so let's
44:59 - quickly
45:01 - um
45:03 - let's get
45:11 - let's get beta 6.
45:18 - i can't believe it's almost noon
45:20 - what a day
45:23 - what a day
45:32 - um let me copy that over here oh do i
45:35 - have processing open right now because
45:36 - no yeah okay
45:38 - quit this
45:40 - see if it'll let me do this
45:42 - replace
45:43 - okay
45:45 - put this here let's try to get beta 6
45:47 - going
45:52 - now one thing i also want to sort out is
45:57 - what is the uh best
46:07 - so i personally love the purple theme
46:14 - and
46:16 - i just want to see like i think for
46:19 - let me see if i can just move this over
46:21 - a tiny bit
46:23 - i don't actually need this notebook here
46:27 - so that can give me a little bit more
46:28 - space because the further i stand to the
46:30 - side here the more space there is for
46:32 - the code
46:34 - and then if i say void setup
46:38 - void draw
46:41 - um mandel
46:45 - mandel bulb
46:49 - and then
46:51 - let's make the console size 24 editor
46:54 - size 32. let's try this
46:58 - how is this for a font size
47:01 - and i know everyone's telling me and the
47:04 - other thing though is as much as i love
47:06 - this particular theme
47:11 - it's not clear to me if this is good for
47:14 - um
47:18 - if this
47:19 - if this is optimal for viewing the
47:21 - viewing experience so let's take a look
47:23 - here
47:25 - like this is the default so i wonder if
47:28 - um
47:32 - i wonder if this is better
47:36 - i've i've i think the text
47:39 - was hard to read
47:42 - um
47:45 - yeah
47:47 - people are saying looks good but i can't
47:48 - tell
47:51 - yeah i think the purple theme i find to
47:53 - be lots of fun
47:54 - but the this this sort of default theme
47:57 - i mean i could certainly pick
48:00 - something like this but i think a light
48:02 - as much as i love a dark a good dark
48:04 - theme
48:05 - i think for legibility oh i love the
48:07 - yellow
48:09 - um
48:14 - oh boy oh no no
48:17 - too many comments
48:20 - all right
48:21 - hold on we're gonna i i again i'm
48:23 - probably gonna go with light
48:25 - and
48:27 - uh
48:29 - uh
48:30 - for video playback
48:33 - not for your own coding
48:36 - dark
48:38 - light
48:40 - okay
48:43 - so i put up a quick little poll
48:47 - um if people want to vote i'm just
48:49 - curious but i personally think that for
48:52 - legibility in a video
48:55 - the light theme is better although what
48:58 - do i use for p5 that's not true
49:01 - i'm always using this in p5 so maybe i'm
49:04 - wrong about that but i did feel like
49:06 - this particular dark theme
49:08 - these colors the red here is not very
49:12 - visible so i wonder if there is
49:15 - like a better
49:18 - i'm just not happy with it
49:20 - with any of these dark this one this one
49:22 - is a little bit closer to i think
49:25 - what could work
49:30 - um but i want accessibility and contrast
49:33 - is a major thing to pay attention to
49:37 - i think i i think i need to go with the
49:39 - light one
49:41 - people are voting for the dark
49:44 - i just don't see that any of these
49:46 - i hear you all i'm sorry that i'm gonna
49:49 - veto it
49:51 - but i don't feel that these dark themes
49:54 - are presently
49:56 - high contrast enough
49:58 - like um
50:01 - how do i do that uh
50:08 - there is
50:11 - there's something that i downloaded once
50:17 - there was a tool that i was able to
50:19 - download and hover over things
50:25 - uh
50:29 - i swear there was like something i could
50:31 - download that allowed me to check
50:49 - this is for windows oh for mac i think
50:52 - this might have been what i was doing
50:58 - use an eye drop tool
51:11 - turquoise plus black is my favorite the
51:13 - top theme zero zero my favorite is three
51:15 - oh
51:16 - um
51:22 - um this is this is like welcome to the
51:25 - coding training i do everything within
51:27 - my power to procrastinate because i'm so
51:29 - afraid of trying to code the thing
51:34 - i'm actually getting quite warm it's
51:36 - getting hot in here which is like sort
51:37 - of the idea because i'm going to turn
51:38 - off the heaters
51:41 - let's just see how this goes
51:46 - look we're doing a service here because
51:47 - if we can help improve
51:49 - the themes that are in
51:51 - the processing ide that's a that's a
51:53 - good thing for everybody
51:55 - what was that thing called color
52:00 - come on run
52:08 - okay this is not the thing that i was
52:10 - thinking of but it will work so let me
52:12 - go
52:13 - here
52:15 - so for example oops no no hold on
52:20 - so the foreground color
52:22 - the foreground color for example
52:24 - is wait
52:26 - how come this is not working
52:29 - oh maybe it is showing me the colors
52:31 - yeah
52:33 - but i should be seeing black here i'm so
52:35 - confused
52:38 - this is not working the way that i
52:40 - expected it to
52:42 - all right
52:44 - and background color
52:50 - yeah this is not working correctly
52:53 - why did that not work
52:56 - ah
52:59 - do you see how this is not working
53:02 - it's like not picking up processing for
53:04 - some reason
53:10 - you've got to give it accessibility
53:11 - permissions okay
53:13 - where do i do that
53:15 - preferences
53:17 - um
53:20 - thank you
53:24 - accessibility
53:29 - where are those
53:39 - uh
53:40 - display
53:45 - somebody's going to tell me give it
53:47 - permission
53:49 - um
53:51 - where do i give it permission
53:55 - maybe that's in like privacy
54:00 - usually it requests
54:02 - let me see if i can get it to request
54:07 - um
54:17 - okay
54:18 - security and
54:22 - privacy screen recording is that what it
54:25 - needs
54:35 - um okay let's do that
54:41 - that must be what it needed right
54:48 - yeah there we go thank you everybody
54:52 - [Music]
54:59 - pass all right you know what
55:02 - this passes with flying colors literally
55:07 - uh
55:08 - so now i feel better about it
55:11 - um
55:13 - i kind of like this one wait hold on but
55:14 - wait is this the one i wanted to pick
55:17 - this is so important
55:19 - in all this time
55:22 - the purple i don't like the red i like
55:24 - to like this one
55:26 - this one's pretty good
55:31 - what was i i think actually i think i
55:33 - kind of like that one
55:35 - which one was it no i'm lost
55:43 - oh was this one it's kind of cute
55:46 - oh but i really got to check this purple
55:48 - is the issue
55:51 - so
56:01 - yeah it failed so this
56:03 - so this is the issue that that purple
56:05 - fails
56:07 - um so let's not use this one
56:14 - let's try
56:18 - this one
56:24 - pass
56:30 - fail see these fail
56:41 - pass
56:45 - oh that one whoa wait a sec
56:49 - interesting
56:50 - enhanced
56:52 - oh it passes for large text
56:55 - uh so that's fine because i'm using
56:58 - large text i believe
57:01 - fails for large text
57:03 - minimum enhanced i feel like we should
57:06 - get the enhanced large text
57:09 - so none of these are really passing if
57:11 - i'm being perfectly honest
57:39 - oops
57:52 - yellow
58:02 - background
58:06 - oh so close
58:24 - yeah much of these are actually having
58:26 - issues
58:27 - um
58:30 - so
58:31 - i don't know what to do now
58:34 - i'm lost i expected one to sort of be
58:37 - obvious
58:42 - okay i gotta put this away and um
58:46 - it's going to be okay i will be doing
58:48 - the best that i can
58:51 - with the tools that i have
58:58 - and i'm going to pick one i'm just going
58:59 - to pick one based on what looks good to
59:01 - me i mean i kind of tempted to go with
59:04 - this because this is just the default
59:06 - i'm going to use the default yeah white
59:09 - background is better for visually
59:10 - impaired okay
59:14 - start coding
59:16 - i'm gonna use the default
59:19 - i can't no one i can't
59:22 - i can't get too wrapped up in this the
59:24 - default is the default is the default
59:26 - let's use that okay
59:29 - um close this
59:31 - close this
59:34 - and
59:43 - okay
59:45 - okay
59:47 - all right everybody i i procrastinated
59:49 - enough
59:54 - i am going to make sure the recording is
59:56 - still working
60:02 - um stop recording start recording
60:07 - okay
60:08 - now let me turn off the heaters
60:17 - so that we have as pure
60:21 - audio as possible
60:29 - okay
60:32 - all right everyone
60:36 - it is time now
60:38 - no more procrastinating no more
60:41 - monkeying around
60:44 - i must code the thing
60:48 - that's what you're all here for it's
60:50 - only
60:51 - an hour in
60:53 - i kind of have to pee
60:58 - oh my god
61:00 - does anybody still watch while there's
61:02 - still people here i can't believe it all
61:04 - right 32 30. this is good
61:06 - this is the setup we're going for
61:12 - just please
61:14 - please allow me
61:16 - a 30 second break okay i'm muting my
61:19 - microphone
61:29 - do
61:30 - [Music]
61:45 - do
61:55 - [Music]
61:56 - do
61:58 - [Music]
62:05 - [Music]
62:26 - [Music]
62:29 - all right i'm back
62:35 - okay everybody it's finally happening
62:38 - here we go
62:39 - um
62:45 - i'm just making sure i have all the like
62:48 - views that i need over here
62:55 - okay
62:57 - okay apologies i see some people in the
62:59 - chat are a little uh unhappy with how
63:01 - long i've how much time i've wasted here
63:04 - and you know
63:06 - it's just kind of my process but
63:09 - it is what it is
63:10 - okay
63:11 - um
63:14 - if you that's why i also have edited
63:17 - versions sorry everybody i'm just going
63:18 - to put this down here so i can see for
63:20 - when i'm recording
63:22 - okay great
63:25 - all right here we go
63:28 - all right
63:33 - yeah i know everyone's complaining also
63:35 - about the autofocus it it stays stable
63:37 - when i stay here coding and talking to
63:39 - you so hopefully that's gonna be fine
63:41 - okay
63:50 - okay here we go everybody
63:58 - i just
64:06 - okay
64:18 - it takes so much energy to blow the
64:20 - train whistle
64:25 - okay
64:26 - i can do this i can do this
64:33 - hello everyone we are no we're not we
64:36 - it's just me here there's no we
64:40 - hello everyone i am back for another
64:43 - coding challenge i am quite terrified of
64:45 - what i'm about to make today that i'm
64:47 - showing you pictured here to the left of
64:49 - me although i have a feeling what i end
64:51 - up at the end will look nothing like the
64:53 - beauty that you're seeing but we'll see
64:55 - how far i get how close i can get
64:58 - to this
65:00 - no more starting over this is my one
65:03 - starting over
65:05 - and um
65:08 - yeah here we go
65:11 - hello everyone welcome to another coding
65:13 - challenge the mental bulb i'm a little
65:16 - bit terrified if i'm being perfectly
65:17 - honest of what i'm about to attempt to
65:19 - do uh i have made many years ago almost
65:23 - six years ago there is a coding
65:24 - challenge called the mandelbrot set
65:26 - which is the well-known famous
65:29 - ah
65:30 - okay
65:32 - go dan thanks luke okay wait let me end
65:34 - this stupid poll
65:38 - it's really bothering me i can't see the
65:39 - chat messages
65:42 - okay
65:45 - this is this is really last time last
65:47 - time
65:49 - hello everyone and welcome to another
65:51 - coding challenge the mental bulb
65:54 - yeah i'm a little bit afraid if i'm
65:56 - being perfectly honest with this the
65:57 - formulas look quite a bit scary but the
66:00 - beauty of the mandelbulb cannot be
66:03 - exaggerated
66:04 - it is just gorgeous look at it so i'm
66:06 - going to attempt somehow to understand
66:09 - the math behind this form and how to
66:11 - take the first steps to creating my own
66:14 - mandelbulb in processing now if you want
66:16 - some prerequisites before you get i
66:19 - don't you don't need these i'm just
66:20 - going to plow ahead and try to explain
66:22 - everything as i go but there are two
66:25 - previous coding challenges that i made
66:27 - one is the mandelbrot set the 2d version
66:29 - the very famous fractal the mandelbrot
66:31 - set the 2d version of what i'm about to
66:33 - attempt to make this 3d mandelbulb
66:36 - and also i have made did a coding
66:38 - channel
66:39 - and also i created what am i saying here
66:43 - and also you might want to take a look
66:44 - at the coding challenge on spherical
66:47 - geometry because the idea here is is
66:50 - there a way to take the 2d form that is
66:52 - the mandelbrot set and extrude it
66:56 - extract it deform it stretch it pull it
67:02 - and make it into something
67:04 - three-dimensional
67:14 - all right so um
67:25 - so a quick bit of history here the
67:27 - mandelbulb was constructed for the first
67:29 - um
67:35 - a quick bit of history here the first
67:37 - construction of the mandelbulb fractal
67:39 - itself was in 1997 by jule ruiz and in
67:43 - 2009 it was further developed by daniel
67:46 - white and paul nylander
67:49 - and
67:50 - and
67:52 - and the these ancient
67:55 - and these beautifully designed 90s and
67:58 - early 2
68:00 - and these beautifully designed 2000 era
68:02 - web pages are my core reference for what
68:06 - i'm going to build in today's processing
68:14 - if you want to try coding along with me
68:16 - go and download processing the java
68:19 - development environment
68:22 - if you want to code along with me go
68:24 - ahead and download processing at
68:26 - processing.org it is a creative coding
68:29 - development environment
68:31 - built in java and there is a wonderful
68:34 - and beautiful community of people using
68:35 - both processing and the javascript
68:38 - creative coding framework p5.js which i
68:40 - also use in a lot of my videos
68:42 - okay
68:44 - so acidic is saying should probably show
68:46 - the old websites when you mention them
68:49 - um
68:52 - i truly should not read the chat while
68:54 - i'm doing this
68:56 - oh the chat's very critical of me today
68:59 - what is going on it's okay it's gonna be
69:00 - fine
69:01 - editing makes it all kind of great
69:04 - we just edit all that out and move it
69:06 - around and fix it it's going to be fine
69:07 - um so i am kind of like in my head have
69:11 - i know i have an awareness of the
69:12 - post-production that i plan to do in
69:14 - which case i'm going to recapture and
69:15 - show these different web pages and
69:16 - images so it's a little bit lazy for me
69:18 - not to show them to you here right now
69:20 - but that's kind of um
69:22 - [Music]
69:23 - uh what's happening today all right um
69:26 - all right so let's go over
69:31 - so
69:40 - so let me go over here
69:50 - okay now people are giving me nice
69:52 - comments
70:00 - let me start by briefly reviewing what
70:03 - is the mandelbrot set
70:17 - does it matter in the mandelbrot set
70:20 - which axis i mark as a and which one i
70:22 - mark as b i mean clearly it does
70:27 - uh i think b would be the y-axis
70:37 - hold on i've got to make this somewhat
70:39 - continuous for
70:40 - matia
71:25 - just see if anybody in the chat is
71:26 - saying anything that i want to take a
71:28 - look at
71:30 - b is the imaginary axis it must be the
71:32 - vertical one thank you john that's what
71:33 - i assumed okay
71:40 - so i don't want to rehash the entire
71:42 - thing again from my mandelbrot video but
71:45 - the idea of the mandelbrot set is we are
71:48 - looking at every two-dimensional
71:50 - coordinate on the complex plane a
71:53 - complex number is a number that has a
71:55 - real component
71:58 - and an imaginary component
72:05 - now in my
72:07 - when i recorded the mandelbrot set i was
72:10 - trying to be sort of fun and friendly
72:12 - and goofy and i was talking about
72:14 - imaginary numbers as imaginary and not
72:16 - real no they are things that exist the
72:20 - imaginary numbers are not actually
72:22 - imaginary we just refer to them that way
72:26 - i i can't get going today but i'm gonna
72:29 - get there i'm gonna get there people
72:36 - now when i was recording my mandelbrot
72:38 - set coding challenge i was a little bit
72:40 - flippant in talking about imaginary
72:42 - numbers as imaginary no they really do
72:44 - exist in theoretical mathematics the
72:47 - square root of negative one
72:53 - is i and this is fundamentally needed
72:56 - for all sorts of applications that ha
72:59 - that we do in the real world
73:03 - the magic of the mandelbrot set is when
73:05 - you take any complex number one that has
73:09 - a real component
73:11 - that i'm plotting along the x-axis an
73:13 - imaginary component that i'm applauding
73:16 - along the axis if i look at any given a
73:19 - and b pair
73:22 - and i take that a and b pair
73:27 - and put it into this constant c
73:30 - i start with z equals zero and then i
73:33 - say z equals zero squared plus c
73:37 - so zero plus c so now z is c and then
73:41 - that's z
73:43 - iteration zero z iteration one equals
73:50 - c squared plus
73:53 - c because it's this and then
73:56 - it's this squared plus c and then
73:59 - iteration two
74:02 - c squared plus c squared plus c right
74:05 - this continuous loop of taking this
74:08 - complex number starting z as zero
74:11 - squaring plus c the result squared plus
74:13 - c the result squared plus c and the
74:16 - question we have to ask is
74:18 - is this bounded or does it tend to
74:21 - infinity
74:33 - is it the bounded ones or the mandelbrot
74:35 - set or the infinite ones or the
74:37 - mandelbrot set
74:38 - i need to go look that up
74:44 - recursion i should mention it's like a
74:45 - recursion recursive algorithm um hold on
74:48 - is the set of complex numbers for which
74:50 - the function does not diverge to
74:53 - infinity okay yes
75:03 - we can keep that in by the way me having
75:05 - to go check what it says here i can even
75:07 - stage that again
75:09 - is the mandelbrot set
75:11 - the num
75:12 - is the mandelbrot set the complex
75:14 - numbers that when put into this
75:16 - recursive iteration they go to infinity
75:18 - or that they remain bounded i forget
75:22 - do this again because we want to include
75:23 - it
75:26 - the mandelbrot set is the set of complex
75:28 - numbers for which the function does not
75:31 - diverge to
75:36 - infinity so the set of numbers that do
75:39 - not diverge to infinity are in the
75:42 - mandelbrot set and i'm not really going
75:43 - to be able to draw it but i'm going to
75:45 - try to overlay what the mandelbrot set
75:46 - actually looks like right here
75:53 - so this begs the question i've already
75:56 - gone through this i've done it as a
75:57 - video i've done the julius set which is
75:59 - another way of looking at different
76:00 - components of the mandelbrot set or
76:03 - i've done the julia set which is another
76:05 - way of looking at pieces of the
76:06 - mandelbrot set and uh we go down that
76:09 - road
76:11 - but how could this be taken and made
76:14 - into some
76:16 - form
76:17 - how could this be taken and made into
76:19 - three dimensions
76:21 - the a complex number by its nature is
76:25 - mapped to a two-dimensional plane a real
76:28 - component and an imaginary component
76:30 - there is no
76:31 - a plus b plus there's no third axis here
76:45 - we need
76:46 - to make the mandelbulb
76:48 - some kind of triplex number
76:57 - and if you look back at the brief
76:59 - history of different attempts at this
77:02 - idea of a mandelbulb there were a
77:04 - variety of approaches and the one that i
77:06 - want to focus on and look at today is
77:08 - that 2009 approach
77:12 - by
77:14 - the peoples whose name i can't remember
77:18 - uh let's see
77:23 - um
77:27 - i guess i don't need to
77:29 - necessarily say
77:31 - yeah okay
77:32 - daniel white and paul nylander
77:38 - the 2009 approach from
77:41 - the 2009 approach that daniel white and
77:44 - paul nylander developed using spherical
77:47 - coordinates
78:01 - what do i mean by spherical coordinates
78:03 - well
78:07 - what do i mean by spherical coordinates
78:09 - well let me take another step back and
78:12 - let's just briefly talk about polar
78:14 - coordinates of course i have an entire
78:16 - video i probably have like 10 videos on
78:18 - polar coordinates
78:19 - where instead of looking at an x
78:24 - where with polar coordinates instead of
78:26 - looking at
78:27 - perhaps an x y location
78:31 - we can look at this x
78:46 - i kind of want more space but i want to
78:47 - leave this here
78:53 - so polar
78:56 - hold on
78:59 - okay i got it
79:01 - i've got it now
79:02 - let's make a little uh
79:05 - table here
79:07 - cartesian
79:11 - polar
79:13 - so the idea of a cartesian coordinate in
79:15 - two dimensions is an x
79:18 - y
79:19 - coordinate
79:21 - the idea of a polar coordinate in two
79:23 - dimensions
79:24 - is
79:25 - r comma theta meaning x y
79:31 - is some x offset and y offset from the
79:35 - origin and i'm using kind of a computer
79:37 - graphics window
79:39 - i don't want to okay hold on i got it i
79:41 - got it
79:42 - let me do this again i got the
79:44 - explanation now
79:45 - i don't know if i need all of this
79:47 - background but why not
79:56 - let's talk first about polar and
79:58 - cartesian coordinates
80:00 - i don't know
80:02 - i don't remember i've lost my train of
80:04 - thought
80:05 - too choo choo
80:07 - i don't know if i should probably go
80:08 - look at the chat i see lots of hearts
80:10 - that's a good sign let's see i can't
80:12 - read the chat from over here but i could
80:13 - see hearts going by which actually is
80:16 - quite helpful okay
80:19 - let me make a little table to compare
80:26 - i can't get this
80:28 - okay i got it i got it
80:30 - let me make i'm gonna make a little
80:32 - table here to compare
80:40 - so our cartesian coordinate is an x y
80:42 - pair
80:50 - you know
80:53 - we look at it at what is its
80:55 - x component and what is its y component
80:57 - a polar coordinate
81:00 - is an r theta pair
81:12 - what is the distance from the origin and
81:14 - at what angle what is the radius and
81:16 - angle
81:24 - but this is only in two dimensions what
81:27 - happens when we go to three dimensions
81:29 - well we still have a cartesian
81:32 - coordinate in three dimensions
81:51 - uh
81:59 - how do you draw this this is so hard
82:03 - i can't do perspective
82:15 - that's not anywhere close to right maybe
82:17 - i can put something here to correct that
82:28 - and then the spherical equivalent of
82:30 - that
82:34 - shear shear recall no no
82:46 - oh
82:47 - how do i write fee
82:50 - i have to go look up the greek letter
82:52 - theta is used for an angle but then in a
82:55 - spherical coordinate you need the radius
82:57 - and two angles one of which is the greek
82:58 - letter phi i got to figure out how to
83:00 - write that
83:06 - cube
83:08 - draw rectangles on the x-axis it's like
83:10 - a p
83:11 - yeah
83:23 - so i think i want to do the lower case
83:25 - version so i can just do like a little
83:28 - boom
83:30 - a cube fifi fee okay let's see
83:34 - all right
83:43 - hold on
83:53 - there that's the lower case fee
84:04 - i think by the way
84:10 - that
84:23 - that's a way of drawing it then i have
84:25 - this
84:36 - well i still can't really get it but you
84:39 - get the idea of the three dimensions i'm
84:41 - trying my best
84:55 - the idea here being if there were some
84:57 - way that we could take this idea of a
85:00 - complex number but think of it as a
85:03 - spherical coordinate if we could apply
85:05 - the same iterative formula but have this
85:08 - c component include three values
85:12 - maybe there's a way that we could
85:14 - determine if
85:16 - points within a three-dimensional space
85:18 - go to infinity or are they bounded
85:28 - okay so let me come back
85:31 - over here
85:52 - um okay
85:57 - okay so let me get back to
86:02 - here
86:28 - okay so let me find
86:32 - the next part here
86:40 - okay
86:41 - let me get to
87:03 - this 2009 explanation for me is a sort
87:06 - of canonical reference point to begin
87:08 - with and we can see here this exact
87:12 - formula
87:13 - z
87:17 - um
87:21 - we can see here this exact formula that
87:23 - looks very much like the original
87:25 - mandelbrot formula
87:27 - z
87:28 - equals z to the n power plus c now i do
87:31 - want to discuss why does it say n
87:34 - rather than what i have over here on the
87:36 - white board very specifically saying z
87:38 - squared so we're going to have to come
87:40 - back to that at some point
87:43 - whoops
87:44 - there we go
87:48 - but the key thing to note here is that z
87:50 - and c are hyper complex triplex numbers
87:54 - representing cartesian x y and z
87:57 - coordinates
88:15 - so i want to get to the next step here
88:17 - and even look at the pseudo code down
88:19 - here but let's at least begin
88:24 - uh ari is saying i should explain what
88:26 - he means by bounded okay so you know
88:28 - what adi ari i think that's going to
88:30 - become clear what i'm writing in the
88:32 - code um so yeah i will that's a very
88:34 - good point i wonder if i can address
88:36 - that
88:37 - um
88:39 - a little bit more specifically
88:41 - but um i i will
88:43 - that will become clear once i get to the
88:44 - code
88:48 - so before i get into these formulas and
88:50 - then even into seeing if this pseudo
88:52 - code can apply into my code
88:54 - let me begin by just setting up our
88:56 - processing environment to have a 3d
88:59 - space that i can begin to work it
89:13 - and the way that i'm going to work on
89:14 - this problem is by thinking of a sort of
89:17 - box of voxels like if i just have a
89:20 - plain old
89:24 - 2d canvas i have a plane of pixels if
89:28 - that 2d canvas were to become a cube
89:31 - there are
89:32 - points contained within a box each with
89:35 - an xyz component and i need some
89:37 - variable to keep track of the dimensions
89:39 - of that box
89:47 - let's start with just 64.
90:32 - huh
90:40 - oops
90:42 - i went through all this trouble to set
90:43 - up the dimension variable and forgot to
90:45 - use it
91:01 - and i'm going to do something just i
91:04 - think is hopefully going to help us out
91:05 - later i'm going to call these a b and c
91:08 - instead of x y and z
91:26 - then i want to
91:28 - take those abc values and map them to an
91:31 - xyz component in the three-dimensional
91:34 - space
91:53 - and just so i can sort of see the fact
91:55 - that this is a 3d space that i'm working
91:57 - in let me just continuously like rotate
91:59 - the y axis
92:07 - let's see what we get
92:22 - is my frame rate really that low
92:25 - i'm just curious
92:32 - yeah why is it so slow just to do that
92:34 - many
92:35 - points i guess it is
92:38 - i wouldn't have thought so to do 64
92:41 - cubed points
92:50 - there we go that's better
93:06 - i'm having some performance issues doing
93:08 - so many points let me reduce just for
93:10 - now down to the third dimensions of 32.
93:15 - and there we can see so i've drawn
93:17 - basically a 3d cube as a point cloud
93:26 - i'm rendering every single voxel inside
93:29 - that cube
93:45 - thinking about this okay
93:53 - one thing i just want to do is
93:56 - it's a window location
94:10 - yeah so there's by the way there's a um
94:15 - i don't know if i really want to mention
94:17 - this in the video but there's a nice
94:19 - function called window move so that i
94:21 - can uh always place the window over
94:24 - there which i prefer so that the code is
94:25 - a little bit viewable
94:27 - yeah
94:29 - so i know that you want me to add a step
94:31 - size and all of that but i'm i'm in my
94:35 - brain
94:36 - the way that i'm doing this is because
94:38 - i'm going to use these as the triplex
94:40 - numbers
94:44 - um
94:48 - another thing i can do here just to i
94:52 - like can i
94:56 - like subtly
95:08 - um
95:18 - um
95:23 - everybody has so many questions and
95:24 - suggestions i have to just kind of keep
95:26 - going with the way that i'm doing this
95:30 - and
95:34 - and we'll see where that deletes but
95:35 - just to address those questions the map
95:37 - function takes any value within a given
95:39 - range and maps it to a new range and i
95:42 - do have a whole video about the map
95:44 - function and this is an easy way for me
95:45 - to take all those points and spread them
95:48 - out between negative 100 and 100.
95:50 - um all right i'm going to leave this
95:52 - window move in here actually you know
95:53 - i'll just address it because maybe it's
95:55 - going to stay
96:02 - i briefly just want to point out that
96:04 - this window move function is a way of
96:06 - setting where the window appears when i
96:08 - run the sketch and just for visibility's
96:10 - sake i want it to be off to the right
96:12 - that's the current function it was such
96:14 - a long explanation um
96:18 - i briefly want to mention that i added
96:19 - this window move function to set the
96:21 - processing window itself over to the
96:23 - right it's a
96:24 - that's just
96:26 - i can get this i briefly want to mention
96:28 - that i've i basically want to mention
96:30 - this window move function that i'm
96:31 - adding which will set the processing
96:32 - window itself over to the right just
96:35 - because i'm obsessed with the sort of
96:36 - layout here that's what the function is
96:38 - called in the current beta might change
96:40 - by the time you're watching this video
96:47 - just make sure i have pc cam oh yeah
96:55 - i also want to import a library called
96:57 - pzcam which allows me to sort min
97:00 - i also want to import a library called
97:02 - pzcam which allows me to manipulate the
97:04 - view of the three-dimensional space very
97:06 - easily
97:35 - what is it called
98:02 - oh peasy
98:13 - peasy cam
98:14 - pz cam will center the view in the
98:16 - middle so i don't need this translate
98:18 - anymore
98:20 - and i'm going to also take out the
98:21 - rotate
98:26 - and now you can see that i can kind of
98:28 - move around the space myself and i can
98:30 - see this point cloud of
98:33 - and i can see this cube point cloud
98:36 - again
98:38 - now you can see that i can manipulate
98:39 - the view of the space myself and see
98:42 - this
98:42 - point clout
98:48 - now i can use the mouse and scroll to
98:51 - manipulate the view of the 3d space
98:53 - itself
98:57 - yeah that's all i want to say
99:01 - okay
99:05 - all right
99:09 - this variable 300 i think positions the
99:11 - camera so i want to
99:14 - be a little bit further away
99:17 - and there we go
99:41 - okay
99:45 - how's my recording going i'm going to
99:47 - hit stop and start
99:51 - oh my god
99:57 - i think i wasn't recording that whole
99:59 - time
100:08 - i think when i hit stop and start
100:10 - recording
100:11 - it didn't restart the recording when did
100:14 - i when did i last do that
100:16 - am i gonna have to redo the i'm excited
100:17 - to redo this whole thing
100:20 - because i feel like i was just messing
100:22 - it up left and right and i haven't
100:24 - really gotten into the the uh
100:27 - oh my god
100:28 - i mean the whiteboard stuff we can keep
100:31 - because
100:32 - it is kind of uh
100:35 - oh my god
100:39 - welcome to the coding train everybody
100:42 - yeah the most
100:45 - there's a one kilobyte file
100:49 - let's see what i got here
100:53 - okay
100:56 - okay no that's nothing
100:58 - that's i recorded that whole time of me
101:00 - trying to pick which processing theme to
101:02 - do
101:06 - and then
101:07 - [Music]
101:08 - got three minutes here
101:10 - and i went to do stop and start and i
101:12 - must hit the button twice or something
101:14 - because if it didn't
101:16 - work at least i discovered this now
101:23 - all right everybody
101:25 - um
101:36 - don't worry i'm not leaving this room
101:38 - today
101:39 - until i finish this
101:42 - and i think
101:47 - that i could redo this explanation
101:50 - um the thing is this was recorded
101:52 - because this view is just the straight
101:54 - view and i was pressing the button
101:56 - correctly
102:04 - um
102:05 - oh i'm so sad
102:08 - you two i know youtube recorded it um so
102:12 - here's what i'm going to do i'm going to
102:13 - take a short break
102:16 - um and i'm going to come back and start
102:17 - this over and the good news is i get to
102:19 - include
102:21 - this really helpful reminder that simon
102:23 - said which is that
102:25 - saying imaginary numbers aren't real is
102:27 - like saying negative numbers aren't real
102:29 - plus i can also explain the what i mean
102:31 - by bounded
102:33 - so those things that were confusing i
102:35 - can get right the next time
102:38 - and if all of you um
102:41 - next coding challenger
102:42 - i haven't made this
102:45 - um
102:47 - so
102:48 - here's the thing it's not that this
102:50 - isn't being recorded because ultimately
102:51 - this is being recorded because
102:54 - youtube is recording this but i have a
102:56 - system now that's recording
102:59 - every single camera and laptop feed all
103:02 - as individual feeds so that i can put it
103:05 - together in a variety of ways replacing
103:07 - the background and i won't be able to do
103:08 - any of that
103:10 - um
103:12 - with the footage that i have but i used
103:14 - to not do it this way but i'm i'm gonna
103:17 - um
103:18 - i'm gonna hit stop on the recording
103:21 - i'm gonna take a moment to thank today's
103:23 - sponsor
103:24 - which probably will never sponsor the
103:26 - coding trade again
103:28 - ai camp and
103:30 - i'm going to do it again like chris ray
103:32 - says and i can always still use the
103:34 - original recording so let me take a
103:36 - minute here um to just uh boy i let me
103:40 - just
103:41 - deep breath with all of you and say like
103:43 - one of the things that makes this
103:44 - possible for me to do is having sponsors
103:46 - and i'm thrilled to introduce
103:48 - i'm thrilled to introduce to you a brand
103:50 - new sponsor of the coding train today
103:52 - which is ai camp and this one feels like
103:54 - it's a really nice alignment my channel
103:57 - is all about education and coding i have
103:59 - a lot of um videos about the basics of
104:02 - machine learning
104:03 - you know i'm always surprised and
104:06 - thrilled by uh when i look at my youtube
104:08 - analytics and see how young my audience
104:10 - is in terms of people that are in high
104:12 - school or college um even some
104:15 - you know late middle school age folks
104:17 - and so if you are in that age range of
104:20 - like of 13 between 13 and 18 if you're
104:22 - in high school if you're in middle
104:24 - school and are looking for a summer camp
104:26 - i would like to tell you about ai camp
104:29 - um so ai camp avoids the pitfalls of
104:31 - traditional higher education by enabling
104:33 - students to learn through doing which
104:35 - again is super key because you know you
104:38 - can watch the videos but if you're not
104:39 - trying it yourself and making your own
104:41 - projects
104:42 - you're not getting the sort of full
104:43 - picture of learning so immersive
104:46 - project-based programs um world-class
104:49 - team of experienced educators seasoned
104:51 - industry professionals
104:53 - and i think rather than me kind of like
104:55 - read to you some prepared remarks um let
104:58 - me take a look at their actual website
105:00 - so this is um the summer program learn
105:03 - oh i'm not showing it to you let me
105:05 - switch over here up wrong button this is
105:07 - the summer program learn ai in three
105:09 - weeks this summer you can see um all
105:12 - about the program here small classes
105:15 - online six students max per instructor
105:17 - you build an ai product yourself there
105:20 - are guest speakers
105:21 - and lots more information obviously all
105:23 - about um
105:25 - here i recommend watching these student
105:27 - testimonials
105:28 - what i really want to show you which i
105:30 - think is really cool is seeing what the
105:33 - students made from this camp so you know
105:35 - honestly like these are all like really
105:37 - great ideas for video tutorials that i
105:39 - can do
105:40 - um
105:42 - ai detects fake news ai identify
105:44 - celestial bodies
105:45 - simulates chats mimics tweets look at
105:49 - toxic comments oh and ai generates
105:51 - haiku's like all this text-based stuff
105:53 - is really exciting to me this is good ai
105:55 - head text potholes so look at all these
105:57 - wonderful projects that students made i
106:00 - wonder if they're using ml5 or
106:02 - teachable machine or any of the tools i
106:04 - would expect that they are a lot of the
106:06 - tools that i use in my videos so if
106:08 - you're interested
106:09 - i'll also just point out that you can
106:11 - look on trustpilot.com
106:13 - to see a bunch of uh reviews of ai camp
106:16 - that i would encourage you to check out
106:18 - and then if you go to the link that is
106:21 - on the screen
106:22 - above me right here ai dash camp.org
106:25 - partner codingtrain it is going to take
106:28 - you to this
106:30 - application and um what ai camp wanted
106:33 - me to let you know is that they are
106:34 - giving out scholarships so if you're
106:36 - interested
106:37 - and want to apply for a scholarship this
106:39 - just takes a few minutes to fill out
106:42 - i guess it says it takes seven minutes
106:43 - there you can do it in one sitting
106:46 - 70 percent of applicants got
106:48 - scholarships check out ai camp
106:50 - use this link to let them know that you
106:52 - found ai camp through me and also
106:56 - you know look at all their programs read
106:58 - about their mission and everything here
107:00 - on their website all right so thank you
107:02 - ai camp for sponsoring today's live uh
107:05 - session of the coding train link to ai
107:07 - kev is also in the video description i
107:08 - should have said so you can find it
107:10 - there and uh if any of you sign up and
107:12 - go to ai cam please let me know i want
107:14 - to know what you make i'd be so excited
107:15 - to hear about it um so i'm gonna take a
107:18 - short break that was practice that was
107:20 - practice explanation i'm going to come
107:22 - back uh you can take a look at ai camp
107:25 - website while i'm taking a short break
107:26 - i'll be back in less than a minute uh i
107:29 - have a granola bar
107:31 - maybe i'll eat that and that'll help me
107:33 - uh kind of get a little bit of energy to
107:35 - come back and i'm gonna start over and
107:36 - mandelbulb take two is coming for you if
107:39 - you just started tuning in perfect you
107:41 - didn't miss anything because i'm gonna
107:42 - do it again
107:44 - we're gonna do the mantel bulb coding
107:46 - challenge once again
107:48 - we're gonna plow through it i'm not
107:49 - leaving this room until it's done today
107:51 - have no it's not not going anywhere i'm
107:52 - gonna be here to midnight i'm still
107:54 - gonna be streaming trying to make this
107:55 - mandal bulb
107:56 - whatever happens i'm i'm there so just
107:58 - let me take a short break to have a
108:00 - little bit of water take a couple deep
108:02 - breaths again check out ai camp and i'll
108:05 - be back in just one minute
108:09 - uh
108:10 - intermission button
108:22 - do
108:37 - hey i'm back i forgot to mention
108:39 - something important about ai camp
108:40 - because someone said oh if i'm outside
108:42 - the age of 18 i can't apply and right
108:44 - here in the information that ai cam
108:46 - provided for me it says people out of
108:48 - the application range with experience
108:50 - can apply to teach at the camp as
108:52 - mentors so check out the website write
108:55 - to them if you're interested in applying
108:56 - as a mentor or working at the camp
108:58 - that's something you could consider as
108:59 - well okay
109:01 - i'm not back yet that was uh that was
109:04 - just a quick uh interlude because i
109:06 - wanted to mention that
109:18 - do
109:20 - [Music]
109:31 - [Music]
109:42 - so

114:07 - this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna
114:09 - do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this
114:11 - this stop this stop just stop i'm gonna
114:13 - do this stop stop i just stopped
114:19 - on this stop
114:22 - [Music]
114:55 - [Music]
115:01 - this dot this
115:09 - this dot song never forget this dot all
115:11 - right folks you composed that song for
115:13 - me
115:14 - i'm back
115:16 - welcome to coding train
115:20 - sisyphus sisyphean edition
115:23 - where i uh
115:25 - redo everything i just did in the last
115:29 - it was only two hours
115:32 - oh my god
115:34 - okay um
115:36 - so chris you're gonna be thrilled chris
115:38 - you were at a faculty meeting
115:42 - you missed two hours but guess what
115:44 - i had uh first of all i waste i don't
115:46 - know about wasted but i i spent an hour
115:48 - just setting up
115:50 - then i started working on the mandelbulb
115:53 - but i didn't hit record i did hit record
115:55 - but it didn't take so i'm starting over
115:58 - so i'm gonna do something kind of
115:59 - shocking
116:00 - excuse me i just ate a large granola bar
116:02 - i kind of wolfed it down
116:05 - i'm going to
116:07 - erase
116:08 - this beautiful white board and i'm going
116:10 - to draw all these diagrams again
116:12 - it's perhaps unnecessary
116:17 - but
116:18 - you know
116:19 - i need some this
116:21 - but it is what's happening
116:23 - it is what i'm choosing to do
116:26 - when my mandelbulb coding challenge
116:29 - video is viewed
116:31 - 1 billion times on youtube and becomes
116:33 - the most
116:35 - successful basically it becomes the mr
116:38 - beast video of coding videos
116:41 - then i will not regret
116:44 - the extra
116:46 - couple hours i spend today
116:49 - re-recording and live streaming this
116:51 - explanation because that is almost
116:53 - certainly
116:55 - definitely going to happen and you are
116:57 - the special people who are actually here
117:00 - for this one time only live experience
117:03 - of me redoing the same content again
117:06 - better the one thing i'm worried about
117:08 - is i do feel a little tired
117:12 - and
117:13 - all right i need to get some
117:16 - water for this sponge because it didn't
117:18 - really erase very well i do feel a
117:19 - little bit tired let's see how well by
117:21 - the way i'm walking quite far away now
117:23 - how well does this lav mic signal work
117:27 - um
117:28 - it's getting cold in here again i could
117:30 - turn the heaters on just for a couple
117:31 - minutes
117:32 - maybe i'll do that
117:34 - very briefly
117:36 - let me turn these heaters on just for a
117:38 - couple minutes
117:40 - they blow quite a bit of heat quite fast
117:42 - so i should have done that while i was
117:43 - taking a break obviously
117:45 - um
117:48 - uh and um
117:50 - my voice feels a little bit ratty raspy
117:53 - because i've been talking straight for
117:55 - two hours
117:56 - but
117:59 - then i could just be like yeah never
118:01 - mind let me come back tomorrow morning
118:02 - and do it
118:03 - because i was sort of planning figuring
118:06 - i wasn't going to get to everything
118:07 - today and maybe tomorrow morning i would
118:08 - do some more
118:10 - but i'm going to feel really good if i
118:11 - get this done today
118:13 - how come the heaters i just turned the
118:14 - switches on but they didn't actually
118:16 - come on
118:20 - so
118:22 - are you all with me here
118:26 - uh
118:27 - oh here come the heaters
118:31 - no okay i'm gonna hit start recording
118:41 - and i do see a note from fishy
118:44 - saying that the camera is still going
118:46 - in and out of focus even when i'm
118:48 - standing here
118:51 - i'm looking over to the left here to see
118:53 - if it's doing that
118:58 - i once did a stream which was five hours
119:00 - okay i really do need to deal with the
119:03 - focus on this camera but i'm really
119:05 - afraid to do anything about it right now
119:10 - okay
119:12 - um
119:18 - a minute here
119:23 - finding a kleenex up i didn't mute my
119:25 - microphone
119:26 - nothing i could do about that now
119:28 - get ready for the blowing my nose sound
119:38 - wiping down the white board a little bit
119:40 - more
119:54 - all right i guess that's all i get for
119:56 - the heaters
119:58 - standing under the heater for a minute
120:00 - warming up
120:01 - so nice and warm
120:04 - okay
120:21 - all right everybody
120:28 - okay
120:29 - it's recording
120:34 - it's recording
120:56 - because there is a face on the laptop i
120:58 - really don't that's interesting
121:01 - all right
121:04 - is the in a minute or two not a
121:06 - miniature just a few seconds of not
121:07 - speaking
121:09 - having a little anxiety attack it's fine
121:26 - all right maybe i should deal with the
121:27 - focus
121:28 - let's do that
121:30 - let's deal with the focus it's people
121:32 - keep mentioning it
121:34 - this is going on forever
121:36 - anyway it gives me a minute another
121:38 - couple minutes to turn the heaters on
121:41 - so let's do the focus
121:45 - you will all help me with this
121:47 - i'm actually going to go to this view
121:51 - okay
121:53 - i'm going to turn off
121:59 - the
121:59 - uh how do i turn
122:01 - oh my god okay
122:03 - i have these like sound
122:05 - okay here i am
122:07 - i am going to turn off autofocus i have
122:09 - no idea how to do that
122:16 - this is a sony alpha 7 3.
122:20 - uh maybe this was a bad idea
122:24 - quality aspect ratio let's see
122:28 - long exposure
122:30 - shoot mode
122:32 - shoot auto focus continuous auto focus
122:36 - uh
122:38 - automatic autofocus
122:42 - manual focus
122:45 - okay it is now manual focus
122:48 - let's see how
122:51 - the manual focus is at present
122:54 - like i'm not even touching it
122:57 - it just is what it is
123:00 - like
123:01 - am i in focus
123:04 - i don't think so
123:07 - the problem is i don't i don't have an
123:09 - arm long enough
123:10 - a remote for the camera or another
123:13 - person
123:20 - but i'm looking at it and i actually
123:22 - think that i kind of am in focus
123:25 - like that seems pretty in focus
123:29 - i could increase the
123:32 - f-stop is that what i
123:34 - what was
123:36 - small or high f-stops
123:38 - but i'm looking at myself on the
123:40 - playback
123:41 - and it looks fine
123:47 - could be better
123:49 - not completely
123:52 - all right let me
123:55 - let me increase the
123:58 - f-stop which will also
124:06 - it's going to change
124:14 - it's making it darker
124:16 - but i can also change the iso
124:23 - and bring that up
124:33 - this should be a little bit better now
124:34 - as well
124:40 - so let me just hello hello talk talk
124:42 - talk code code talk talk talk code code
124:44 - i'm going to look over here
125:05 - uh
125:12 - and the focus looks fine to me i don't
125:14 - know how
125:18 - to looks good
125:26 - and the other thing i can do
125:28 - is i could
125:29 - place something here
125:32 - looks excellent it's fine
125:35 - all right
125:36 - all right so the no more autofocus
125:39 - this is the focus
125:41 - i think it'll be good enough
125:46 - looks nice okay
125:48 - you know at this scale looks good to me
125:50 - chris sears thank you
125:52 - um okay
125:57 - i can do this everybody
125:59 - i can do this
126:08 - drinking some water
126:13 - the heaters are going off
126:20 - the recording is recording
126:23 - and we're going to begin
126:29 - okay
126:36 - just
126:42 - okay okay everybody
126:48 - all right
126:51 - here we go
126:54 - it's actually recording i can see it
127:03 - okay
127:04 - i can see
127:06 - the recording button saying it's
127:08 - recording okay
127:15 - hello everybody
127:17 - [Music]
127:21 - thank you graham i'm gonna have to hit
127:23 - show on that oh
127:24 - there we go okay
127:26 - thank you lori
127:30 - hello everyone and welcome to
127:33 - coding challenge i'm slightly afraid
127:35 - it's the mandelbulb look at it it's
127:38 - beautiful it's something that i've
127:40 - wanted to try for a really long time
127:42 - um but i've never really thought that i
127:45 - could do it i think today is the day
127:47 - where maybe i'll be able to now i don't
127:49 - expect that my end result will look as
127:51 - beautiful as the images that i'm
127:53 - featuring
127:54 - that you're seeing right now but it's my
127:56 - hope that we're going to get to the
127:57 - point where we understand the mandelbulb
127:59 - able to write the code for the mando
128:01 - bulb and then you the viewing audience
128:03 - will take it from there and make all
128:05 - sorts of beautiful versions of this
128:07 - amazing intricate fantastical fractal
128:10 - pattern in 3d
128:16 - now before i get going i want to mention
128:18 - two previous videos one is my mandelbrot
128:21 - coding challenge from six plus years ago
128:24 - that is the sort of origin story of the
128:26 - mandelbulb itself i'll get more into the
128:28 - details of that but if you wanted to you
128:30 - could go back and refer to that video as
128:32 - well as my spherical geometry coding
128:35 - challenge which looks at how to take xyz
128:40 - which looks which looks at how to take
128:44 - which looks at how to map cartesian
128:46 - coordinates in 3d space to the surface
128:49 - of a sphere and we're going to need that
128:51 - same math when taking this 2d fractal
128:54 - this 2d mandelbrot set and stretching it
128:58 - twisting it extruding it pulling it low
129:03 - somehow into three dimensions
129:11 - right isn't this intro even better than
129:12 - it was the first time i'm so glad i'm
129:14 - redoing this and i'm recording okay
129:21 - now
129:37 - i'm just trying to think if i want to
129:38 - talk through this quick history thing
129:42 - um
129:47 - yeah so
129:57 - potential 3d version of the fractal okay
130:09 - this is not a new
130:12 - this is not a new concept the original
130:14 - proposal for a 3d version of the
130:16 - mandelbrot fractal the mandelbulb itself
130:19 - was constructed for the first time i'm
130:20 - just reading from the wikipedia page
130:22 - [Laughter]
130:24 - yeah deja vu i know
130:26 - now this is not a new idea the
130:28 - mandelbulb itself this idea of taking
130:30 - the 2d mandelbrot set and making three
130:32 - dimensions was first proposed in 1997 by
130:36 - jules reese but in 2009
130:42 - but if you've seen the mandible before
130:44 - and it appears in popular culture i
130:45 - believe it's in the movie big hero 6
130:47 - maybe i can show a clip of that
130:51 - where else is it
130:54 - and
130:55 - there are some other references
131:10 - oh that was snow falling off the roof
131:14 - did you hear that rumbling it's like an
131:15 - avalanche
131:24 - um
131:33 - the one that you might have seen and the
131:35 - one that i'm going to try to make is the
131:38 - 2009 version developed by daniel white
131:41 - and paul nylander
131:52 - so let's try to understand
131:55 - um is the lighting okay here i feel like
131:57 - i look kind of dark
131:58 - but i guess it's fine it's no different
132:00 - than it was before
132:04 - the lights are all on let me just check
132:06 - something
132:08 - nope it's fine i mean i could brighten
132:10 - it a tiny bit
132:16 - tiny bit brighter
132:18 - i don't know if i want to do it that way
132:19 - actually
132:24 - let's try that okay
132:33 - too bright that's a little bit washed
132:34 - out now i i'm obsessing over this way
132:37 - too much
132:38 - oh you know what happened is the
132:40 - the glare from the snow is a bit
132:43 - brighter now
132:45 - but it's fine
132:46 - it will be what it will be okay
132:56 - there's like a literal avalanche
132:57 - happening right now of snow falling off
132:59 - the roof
133:02 - it's crazy it's like if you can hear
133:04 - that
133:09 - before i get started let's try to
133:13 - before i start with the code let me take
133:14 - a step back and try to explain the
133:17 - concepts from a big picture of you i
133:19 - don't want to rehash the entire
133:21 - mandelbrot set video
133:23 - but we have to start there with the
133:25 - mandelbrot okay
133:28 - before i write the code let me zoom back
133:30 - and take a bigger picture view of what
133:32 - i'm attempting to do here and i don't
133:33 - want to rehash the entire mandelbrot set
133:36 - video with the entire
133:43 - before i start coding let's take a step
133:45 - back and talk about the big picture what
133:47 - is it that i'm really trying to do here
133:49 - and the place where i need to start is
133:51 - the mandelbrot set itself now i don't
133:53 - want to rehash the entire thing the full
133:54 - explanation is in my mandelbrot video
133:56 - but let me just give you the
134:01 - what is it i'm trying to say here
134:04 - what about my rule of not starting over
134:06 - over and over again okay
134:08 - before i write the code let's take a
134:10 - step back and let me try to explain the
134:12 - concepts behind what i'm about to
134:13 - attempt to do here and the place where i
134:15 - really need to start is the mandelbrot
134:17 - set itself now if you want to see the
134:19 - full code and explanation for that i do
134:21 - have a video but let me just give you
134:23 - the core elements of the mandelbrot set
134:25 - itself
135:04 - so the idea of the mandelbrot set
135:08 - the mandelbrot set appears as a pattern
135:12 - on a complex plane while a complex plane
135:14 - is a very fancy term for a plane of
135:17 - numbers that has a horizontal axis and a
135:20 - vertical axis the key difference here is
135:23 - that this complex number which has both
135:25 - a real component
135:29 - and an imaginary component
135:34 - involves something known as i
135:38 - i is the square root of negative one
135:45 - now the reason
135:47 - now this is often referred to as an
135:49 - imaginary number because i don't know
135:51 - the square root of negative one i can't
135:53 - calculate that that must be part of your
135:55 - imagination but it's actually something
135:58 - very real in theoretical and practical
136:00 - mathematics this idea of imaginary
136:02 - numbers it's you know calling it a
136:05 - saying that it doesn't exist is like
136:06 - saying well negative numbers don't exist
136:08 - because i can't actually make you
136:09 - negative three apples
136:18 - the mandelbrot set
136:21 - do you hear that
136:23 - there's an avalanche happening on the
136:25 - roof
136:27 - everything going okay
136:28 - just put some hearts in the chat if this
136:30 - is going fine because i can't see the
136:32 - chat
136:35 - i could just see emojis from over here
136:37 - you know put a lot of like dead skulls
136:39 - if i need to
136:41 - stop what i'm doing
136:49 - the
136:50 - so to visualize the mandelbrot
136:53 - so to calculate and visualize the
136:55 - mandelbrot set the idea is to look at
136:57 - every single
136:59 - complex number on this plane
137:02 - while i'm calling these a and b we could
137:04 - think of them as x and y
137:07 - so if i pick this number i might have a
137:09 - certain value for a
137:11 - maybe it's 0.4 and a certain value for b
137:14 - maybe it's negative 0.2
137:22 - 0.4 minus 0.2 i the idea is that this
137:26 - is this constant c whoops
137:31 - the idea is that this is the constant c
137:33 - in this particular equation
137:35 - and if i take this equation and iterate
137:38 - over and over again applying it
137:40 - recursively onto itself
137:45 - it's literal snow
137:47 - falling outside sliding off of the roof
137:50 - it's making lots of noise
137:57 - and start with
137:59 - the val and start with z at zero the
138:02 - idea is for me to examine what happens
138:05 - to the result
138:09 - and the idea here is to take this number
138:12 - plug it into c
138:13 - start with z equal to zero
138:17 - so z
138:18 - iteration one
138:21 - whoops
138:33 - i mean do you hear that it's crazy
138:37 - why what causes this only just all slide
138:39 - off the roof okay
138:45 - equals zero
138:48 - plus
138:50 - c so now this is the new value of z
138:54 - so at z iteration two i get what's zero
138:58 - plus c is c
138:59 - c squared
139:00 - plus c and then at iteration three i'm
139:04 - going to take this value c squared plus
139:06 - c square it plus c and so on and so
139:10 - forth and the idea here is if i apply
139:12 - this math over and over again
139:15 - the result is going to either go to
139:18 - infinity get really really really really
139:20 - big or stay bounded it's going to kind
139:22 - of oscillate around a stable value
139:28 - so i'm examining every single point on
139:30 - this complex plane running this
139:32 - algorithm and determining whether it
139:35 - stays bounded or tends to infinity
139:37 - the set of the points that stay bounded
139:40 - i always get this confused but the set
139:42 - of the points that stay bounded is the
139:44 - mandelbrot set if i color all of those
139:47 - points black and all the other points
139:49 - that are not part of the metal broad set
139:51 - white i will see this fractal pattern
139:54 - and then of course there are ample ways
139:56 - i can use different kinds of color based
139:58 - on the number of iterations that it that
140:00 - i'm taking and doing and there's all
140:02 - sorts of
140:05 - and then in my previous video i sort of
140:07 - looked at how like well i could look at
140:09 - how many times it takes to iterate
140:11 - before it starts to become unbounded and
140:13 - set colors that way and get beautiful
140:15 - rainbow patterns all visualizing the
140:18 - mandelbrot set
140:25 - let me just see here
140:36 - let me just i'm just curious here
141:06 - you know this isn't useful i was going
141:08 - to say like maybe i should quickly
141:09 - reference and show the code but
141:11 - that's going a little bit
141:14 - further
141:15 - okay
141:16 - so i'm not gonna reference that okay
141:24 - okay so
141:26 - um
141:27 - going back over to here
141:31 - still recording still recording still
141:33 - recording recording i know i should open
141:36 - up this garage door so you can see the
141:37 - snow but it's it's much too cold out so
141:39 - i'm not going to do that right now
141:40 - okay
141:46 - so if this is the mandelbrot set
141:49 - what is the mandelbulb
142:03 - the mandelbrot set is inherently a
142:05 - fractal that lives in two dimensions
142:10 - a complex number is a number that has
142:14 - a real component and an imaginary
142:16 - component two dimensions
142:19 - so how do i take this idea and make it
142:22 - into three dimensions well there's no
142:24 - one way to do this there's no
142:27 - exact precise sort of mathematical
142:30 - mapping to take the mandelbrot set and
142:32 - put it into three dimensions and this is
142:34 - why there have been various attempts
142:35 - over the years the one that i'm going to
142:38 - look at the 2009 version is the one that
142:40 - uses spherical coordinates
142:54 - and the idea here is to say like and the
142:57 - idea here is to say instead of a
143:00 - complex number could we have could we
143:03 - use
143:04 - something called a triplex number
143:11 - after all
143:12 - a coordinate in three-dimensional space
143:18 - has three components to it x y z
143:30 - so i'm going to come back and start to
143:32 - talk about spherical coordinates in a
143:33 - moment but i think this is a good time
143:37 - so there's there's plenty more to this
143:38 - story here that i want to map out some
143:40 - of the math to but i think this is a
143:42 - good time to just take a little pause
143:44 - and actually set up a processing sketch
143:47 - that will allow us to visualize triplex
143:50 - numbers or in essence
143:52 - 3d coordinates in space
144:14 - um
144:16 - okay
144:22 - oops
144:26 - for this coding challenge i'm going to
144:27 - use processing it's a creative coding
144:29 - framework it's built in java you can
144:31 - download it at processing.org and i
144:33 - probably have hundreds of videos to talk
144:35 - about it but check out the website check
144:37 - out the processing foundation to learn
144:39 - more the reason why i'm using it is
144:41 - because it has a wonderful 3d rendering
144:43 - engine that exists in p52 but i want to
144:45 - explore this in processing first
145:05 - oops
145:12 - and this is a little bit of a silly line
145:14 - of co
145:17 - do you not hear the avalanche
145:24 - link to an explanation of triplex
145:26 - numbers all right let me
145:32 - i'm going to come back to that
145:37 - but i think it really just means three
145:40 - it's not really there's not really um
145:48 - um
145:49 - there's not really like a strict
145:51 - definition to it but let's
145:55 - it's not even on the wikipedia page so i
145:58 - think it's sort of like a made-up term
145:59 - for this purpose but anyway
146:02 - um
146:10 - you heard that okay
146:14 - three-dimensional vector yeah okay
146:16 - um
146:23 - hello
146:26 - hold on i'm gonna mute my microphone
147:18 - i've been streaming in here for so long
147:19 - my son came in and he was like what are
147:21 - you are you ever coming back
147:23 - so sorry about that i know i muted
147:25 - because i'm talking to my son
147:28 - um okay
147:32 - yeah all right the audio is back
147:35 - um
147:36 - all right what was i saying ah okay i'm
147:38 - back
147:39 - it's not a rando it's my 13 year old son
147:43 - who
147:45 - had a question i mean there's no school
147:46 - today this is so this is
147:48 - okay here we go
147:54 - um
147:56 - all right
148:00 - i briefly want to point out that i'm
148:02 - using this window move function just
148:03 - because i'm obsessive and i like to have
148:05 - the processing window itself a little
148:07 - off to the right that's a new feature of
148:09 - processing for beta 6. i don't know if
148:11 - it'll stay or their name will get
148:13 - changed but that's what it's doing right
148:14 - now
148:16 - is there i got to be able to like say
148:18 - that in faster and i want to acknowledge
148:20 - it but i also okay
148:25 - let me say a few quick things about the
148:27 - code i have so far size gives me a
148:29 - window size of 600x600 pixels p3d for 3d
148:33 - rendering window move is just because
148:35 - i'm obsessive and i want the processing
148:36 - window to be on the other side of my
148:38 - desktop here that's a new feature i
148:41 - don't know if that name will stay but
148:42 - it's working right now and then i have a
148:44 - draw loop and i'm just drawing a
148:46 - background
148:50 - so
148:53 - oh here comes the plow now there's gonna
148:55 - be a plow so there might be some noise
148:57 - for the plow
149:03 - okay
149:04 - i'm just gonna i'm gonna keep i'm gonna
149:06 - plow through if you will
149:10 - i know i shouldn't do this because of
149:11 - what messed me up before but i'm gonna
149:13 - hit stop
149:21 - okay
149:30 - all right i should be back yes
149:33 - i think i'm back
149:36 - i hope i am
149:42 - and i am also recording to disc again
149:45 - okay we're good that was a temporary
149:47 - glitch
149:49 - don't worry i just checked the video
149:51 - file is recorded to disk it's all there
149:54 - uh what i what i try to what i like to
149:57 - do every so often is stop the recording
149:59 - and restart it just so that file is
150:02 - saved because if it were ever to crash
150:04 - mid recording i lose the whole thing the
150:06 - way that i'm doing my recording
150:08 - so
150:09 - uh and i don't know why it crashed when
150:11 - i did that but we're all good
150:17 - okay
150:21 - wow what a day
150:23 - um
150:25 - okay so where am i here yep
150:35 - the plow is going which is kind of loud
150:37 - but i'm gonna just as i said plow
150:39 - forward
150:42 - oh my god
150:48 - the driveway is being plowed right now
150:52 - i think i should just wait a minute
150:56 - i know i probably should do that
150:59 - corey allen is and it is recording is
151:01 - making a good
151:02 - point that i can record to like mkv and
151:05 - then like change it afterwards and maybe
151:07 - i should do that but right now
151:10 - it's
151:11 - good um
151:15 - okay you can't hear it then fine here i
151:17 - go
151:26 - the first step i'd like to do is just be
151:29 - able to visualize the voxels of a cube
151:33 - because ultimately i'm going to try to
151:34 - place this mantle bulb inside of a fixed
151:37 - space in three dimensions so i'm going
151:39 - to use a variable to talk about the
151:41 - dimensions of a cube
151:46 - just call that
151:48 - i'm going to call that
151:50 - dim short for dimensions
153:28 - okay
153:32 - so i have a nested loop of 32 by 32 by
153:37 - 32 and for each one of those
153:41 - and for each one of those x y z
153:43 - coordinates well
153:47 - i wonder if i should do i j k
153:51 - that might make more sense
153:55 - let me start this over
154:24 - so i'm starting off with a triple nested
154:27 - loop for every i from 0 to 32 and every
154:30 - j from 0 to 32 and every k from 0 to 32
154:33 - let's create an x y z point in three
154:36 - dimensional space
155:12 - and there you see this cube all of the
155:14 - voxels all of these 3d pixels points in
155:18 - three-dimensional space making up a cube
155:24 - every single point is spaced out between
155:27 - negative 100 and 100 along the x y and z
155:30 - axis and something that i can do just to
155:33 - make this a little nicer to examine and
155:34 - look at is add the processing library
155:37 - called pz cam
155:55 - pz cam will center the view in the
155:58 - center of the processing window itself
155:59 - so i no longer need this translate
156:05 - and then once i run the sketch
156:08 - and then once i run the sketch i can now
156:10 - use the mouse to sort of look around
156:13 - zoom in and out of this 3d point cloud
156:22 - if you're wondering what that 500 is
156:24 - doing that's kind of like the camera
156:26 - position how far away am i looking at
156:29 - the points that i'm placing in space
156:36 - so making that 1500 it's quite a bit
156:38 - further away but i can scroll to zoom in
156:40 - and rotate and spin around
156:51 - okay
156:55 - now let me think of
156:57 - what
156:58 - next
157:02 - all right
157:06 - i am still recording i am still
157:08 - recording
157:30 - uh
157:34 - so we have a processing sketch set up to
157:37 - deal with x y z coordinates in a
157:40 - three-dimensional space
157:43 - so this value c right here
157:48 - is instead of
157:50 - so this value c right here instead of
157:52 - being a complex num
157:57 - so how do i make the leap from this
157:59 - value c right here which is a complex
158:02 - number with a x component and a y
158:04 - component to a triplex number with an x
158:07 - component y component and z component
158:17 - and the answer lies within something
158:20 - called a spherical coordinate so before
158:22 - i can get to spherical let's just review
158:25 - what it is what so but before i define a
158:27 - spherical coordinate let's review a
158:30 - polar coordinate first
158:45 - so in two dimensions a cartesian
158:47 - coordinate is an x y coordinate
158:59 - defining a position according to its
159:01 - placement along the horizontal and
159:03 - vertical axis
159:05 - a polar coordinate it on the a polar
159:08 - coordinate in two dimensions is
159:09 - something
159:12 - and i can describe that same point as a
159:14 - polar coordinate
159:27 - its position is no its position is
159:31 - indicated as a distance from the origin
159:33 - r a radius and an angle of rotation
159:36 - theta
159:50 - we can describe points in three
159:51 - dimensions in a similar way using
159:54 - cartesian and spherical
160:11 - cartesian having an x y and z axis
160:47 - and a spherical coordinate being
160:48 - described as an r just like in polar
160:51 - coordinates a distance from the center
160:53 - but then two angles of rotation theta
160:56 - and phi
161:00 - now my ability to draw this is quite
161:03 - limited but i will put up a diagram
161:05 - right here so that you can see something
161:07 - that helps you
161:08 - um
161:11 - now my ability to draw this is quite
161:13 - limited but i'll put up something here
161:15 - that allows you
161:20 - now my ability to draw this is quite
161:22 - limited but i'll put up something here
161:24 - that gives you a nice diagram of the
161:27 - difference between cartesian and
161:28 - spherical coordinates
161:31 - so
161:32 - something i have to make later
161:34 - um
161:44 - so
161:46 - i wanna i'm gonna have to erase this
161:47 - over here to do the next step
161:59 - but why do i need spherical coordinates
162:03 - after all for the regular mandelbrot set
162:05 - i didn't need polar coordinates i could
162:07 - just take this complex number and square
162:10 - it no problem
162:16 - while yes
162:17 - there is a way for me to
162:22 - and yes while i might be able to create
162:24 - some type of analogous version of this
162:27 - with just the xyz itself without the
162:29 - concept of spherical coordinates the
162:31 - mandelbulb
162:34 - the mandelbulb form itself
162:36 - is quite beautiful if we start to look
162:39 - at
162:40 - powers about taking a spherical
162:42 - coordinate
162:48 - the mandelball
162:50 - i'm trying to think of what i'm trying
162:52 - to say here
162:56 - so while there might be a way for me to
162:59 - create a version of the mandelbot set in
163:02 - 3d without the idea of spherical
163:04 - coordinates the mandelbulb that i want
163:06 - to make the one that was developed in
163:08 - 2009
163:09 - uses the idea of spherical coordinates
163:11 - to take a 3d
163:14 - to take a triplex number and square it
163:17 - or cube it or put it to the fourth power
163:20 - and ultimately the one that i'm going to
163:22 - sort of land on is to the eighth power
163:34 - so we have to look at a little bit more
163:37 - math before i put this into the code
164:30 - this
164:32 - hold on a second
164:35 - just gonna check the chat
164:37 - to see if anything is way off
164:42 - don't worry we're further than we were
164:43 - before in the first time
164:47 - just checking
164:54 - did i say mandelbot said that's funny
164:59 - uh okay
165:00 - still recording i kind of want to do
165:02 - stop and start but i'm afraid i'm going
165:04 - to do that when i get back to the code
165:06 - okay hold on i just want to
165:08 - reference a couple formulas here
165:13 - which basically is this
165:16 - this is what i'm looking for the nth
165:17 - power of vector
165:21 - here
165:23 - okay
165:24 - and
165:37 - okay
165:42 - okay we're so close now
165:47 - all right um
165:52 - okay
165:56 - oh wrong view
166:02 - i should have known this was going to be
166:03 - a rough one
166:14 - remember
166:15 - the iterative formula that i'm using for
166:18 - both the mandelbrot set and the
166:20 - mandelbulb is as follows
166:22 - z
166:23 - equals z now with mandelbrot it's z
166:26 - squared but a more generic form would be
166:28 - z to the n plus c
166:34 - and now c
166:36 - is
166:37 - a triplex number
166:40 - so if z
166:43 - equals zero to start we have z the next
166:47 - z is zero to the n plus c
166:51 - which is just c and then the next z
166:55 - is
166:56 - c to the n
166:57 - plus c
166:58 - and the next z is
167:01 - c to the n plus c to the n plus c
167:05 - so looking at this math that i'm doing i
167:08 - need an answer to the question how do i
167:11 - calculate
167:12 - x y z
167:14 - to the nth power
167:20 - and the way that this is done is by
167:22 - taking the xyz point converting it into
167:26 - spherical coordinates applying
167:29 - a formula to set a spherical coordinate
167:31 - to the nth power and then converting it
167:34 - back into xyz you got all that
167:53 - is there no mods on today
167:59 - just doing hide user okay
168:03 - so hopefully that helps
168:16 - sorry about that everybody the spam bot
168:42 - so i'm just trying to think of how to
168:44 - make this transition
169:06 - and this is what white and
169:08 - and this is what daniel white and paul
169:10 - nylander proposed the formula for taking
169:14 - the vector v and setting it to the nth
169:16 - four
169:19 - and this is what
169:20 - and this is what daniel white and paul
169:22 - nylander proposed a formula for taking
169:25 - the vector v an x y z vector
169:30 - and this is what
169:32 - and this is what daniel white and paul
169:34 - nylander proposed a formula for taking a
169:36 - vector v with three components setting
169:39 - it to the nth power is equal to
169:41 - r
169:42 - the distance from the origin to the nth
169:44 - power
169:45 - times
169:46 - sine of n
169:49 - sine
169:50 - of n times theta
169:52 - times cosine of n times phi
169:55 - comma sine of n times theta times sine
169:57 - of n times c comma cosine of n times
170:00 - theta now these
170:02 - values don't come out of nowhere they
170:04 - come out of the math of spherical
170:06 - coordinates
170:09 - look at how if i had
170:12 - a pole look at how if i had a polar
170:14 - coordinate r
170:17 - r theta phi how i could convert that
170:19 - into x y z
170:21 - and how
170:24 - and how if i have an x y z coordinate i
170:26 - can convert that to r theta and phi this
170:30 - is exactly what's happening here in the
170:33 - mandelbulb formula if i can start with
170:36 - my x y convert it to r phi theta plug
170:40 - that into that formula up there to get v
170:44 - to the nth power and then convert it
170:46 - back to x y z so i can plot it
170:51 - i should have the mandelbulb
170:53 - i might not have gotten that exactly
170:55 - right but as i try i've not implemented
170:58 - this before
170:59 - as i well actually i have because i did
171:01 - it for um but it was like a while ago
171:02 - maybe i shouldn't say that
171:04 - um
171:09 - but
171:09 - as i start to put these formulas into
171:12 - the code
171:13 - hopefully we're going to see all of
171:15 - those transformations back and forth and
171:17 - it might become a little bit more clear
171:29 - oh you're right well that's what that's
171:31 - doing ultimately so that's actually a
171:33 - good point
171:34 - um
171:36 - hold on
171:41 - i'm modding the chat today okay um
171:45 - this is a good point simon okay that
171:46 - actually is the conversion back
171:48 - basically but
171:51 - let me give that explanation again
171:54 - and i'll i will uh
171:56 - i will try to correct that a little bit
172:00 - and this is exactly what paul white and
172:03 - daniel nylander propose
172:05 - a formula for taking
172:08 - a vector v that exists in three
172:10 - dimensions and setting it to the nth
172:12 - power
172:14 - using
172:16 - using the spherical coordinates of
172:20 - that
172:21 - sorry using
172:23 - thanks chris
172:28 - and this is and this is the innovation
172:30 - from daniel white and paul nylander a
172:32 - formula for taking a vector v in three
172:35 - dimensions x y z and setting it to the
172:38 - nth power to do that requires the
172:41 - spherical version of that xyz vector we
172:44 - need the r we need the theta we need the
172:46 - fee if you look at that formula
172:58 - we might want to recapture this stuff
173:00 - later matthew but
173:04 - and if i go back to the spherical
173:06 - coordinate coding challenge i did you'll
173:08 - see that there are formulas much like
173:09 - there are with polar to cartesian for
173:11 - taking
173:12 - a spherical coordinate and converting it
173:14 - back to xyz
173:20 - and taking an xyz cartesian coordinate
173:23 - and converting it to spherical are theta
173:25 - phi now i'm not going to derive all
173:27 - these formulas i'm just going to take
173:28 - them as they are written on the page
173:52 - and one wander back to this original
173:54 - proposal which has exactly the formulas
173:57 - written out here
173:58 - this is how i calculate r theta and phi
174:01 - and this is how i set xyz to the nth
174:04 - power
174:05 - i think i can start to put this in the
174:06 - code now i'm going to have to go back
174:08 - and forth between this page and the code
174:10 - many times
174:24 - so the first thing that i want to do is
174:26 - i want to look at the
174:29 - the first thing that i want to do is i
174:30 - want to look at the space the space that
174:32 - i'm evaluating for the mantle bulb as a
174:35 - box between negative one and one
174:39 - so first change i want to do as well as
174:41 - plotting the points it was useful to map
174:43 - the all the voxels out to between
174:45 - negative 100 and 100 i want to now keep
174:48 - all my numbers between the values the
174:50 - range of negative 1 and 1.
174:58 - then from this x y and z coordinate i
175:02 - need to convert that to spherical
175:04 - coordinates
175:18 - so r is
175:21 - the square root of x times x
175:24 - y times y
175:26 - and z times z
175:29 - theta is
175:33 - the arc tangent of the square root of
175:36 - x times x
175:38 - y times y
175:41 - comma z
175:46 - and phi is
175:49 - the arc tangent
175:51 - y comma x
176:03 - what do i do next okay i'm thinking i'm
176:06 - thinking i'm thinking
176:13 - i'm looking at the whiteboard so i need
176:15 - to take oh so this is that's my c
176:19 - i need to take i just need to look at
176:20 - how do i take z to the n power
176:40 - now there's certainly efficiencies that
176:42 - i could do in this code in terms of like
176:43 - i'm squaring numbers and doing the
176:45 - square root multiple times but i'm just
176:47 - going to pre-compute the whole mandel
176:50 - i'm just going to pre-compute the whole
176:52 - mandelball one time and set up so i'm
176:54 - not going to worry about that right now
177:00 - i need a loop
177:02 - no i need a z
177:04 - i need a c
177:06 - let me look back at that web page
177:13 - oh yeah ah okay look at this this is
177:15 - what it's say this is what it's telling
177:16 - me to do right now i need to take get a
177:18 - new x and a new y and a new z
177:49 - you
178:04 - now it's telling me what is n n is
178:07 - really important n is the order it is
178:10 - um
178:13 - now
178:15 - there's now there's some
178:23 - can you hear that
178:24 - that noise there's like the plow and
178:26 - some shoveling going on
178:31 - yeah let me just wait a minute here let
178:33 - uh this is terrible but i'm gonna do my
178:35 - stopping and starting thing so hopefully
178:37 - the stream doesn't crash i'm just gonna
178:39 - stop recording to disk
178:46 - okay
178:47 - the stream is still going i hit stop on
178:49 - the recording so i captured everything
178:50 - up until now and hit start again
178:56 - and it is now you know what it was
178:58 - before
178:59 - the button i can hit it like this stop
179:01 - start stop start
179:03 - if i do it really really fast i think it
179:05 - kind of freaks out
179:09 - we can't hear it okay it's very very
179:10 - quiet that's fine
179:12 - um
179:15 - okay
179:24 - now processing is wondering what is n so
179:27 - n is the order it is the power to which
179:30 - i am going to set everything in my
179:32 - formula z equals z to the n plus c and
179:36 - we can try different numbers to get
179:38 - different patterns but the sort
179:40 - of we're gonna but i want to start with
179:44 - the number eight
180:07 - now it's a little bit unfortunate here
180:10 - is that i want to use
180:14 - what's a little bit unfortunate here
180:16 - is that i want to use the variable z to
180:20 - keep track of z and z and 0 z1 in in a
180:23 - loop
180:24 - but z is also the component of the
180:27 - vector xyz so i think i need a new
180:31 - variable name for this
180:49 - what should that variable be
180:56 - what if i make it a vector and call it
180:57 - zz
180:59 - so it's zz
181:07 - then i'm going to
181:10 - so
181:12 - zeta oh people are saying zeta i love
181:14 - that okay
181:17 - let's call it zeta i love that new
181:20 - variable name makes me so happy
181:26 - now i'm going to do something that i
181:27 - really hate doing and i really hate that
181:30 - i'm about to do this but
181:32 - wow i could do it a different way no no
181:34 - i'm just going to do it the way i hate
181:35 - i'm going to say while true
181:37 - now generally speaking if you're going
181:39 - to say wild true you've got a problem
181:41 - because that's a loop that's never going
181:42 - to end the only way to get out of a loop
181:45 - that's looping while true the you know
181:47 - hard-coded value true that can never be
181:50 - changed is to put a break in somewhere
181:52 - so i need to remember put that break in
181:54 - there else i'm gonna have an infinite
181:55 - loop and everything's gonna crash and
181:56 - we're just gonna throw away all this
181:57 - footage and i'm gonna be done never come
181:59 - back to another challenge ever again
182:01 - because i've been recording this for
182:03 - like so long
182:05 - there's a timer going and hopefully
182:06 - you've just been watching this for like
182:08 - 15 minutes but it's been going on
182:09 - forever
182:19 - and just to set myself up for success
182:21 - i'm going to make a variable called
182:24 - max iterations
182:26 - i'm going to set that equal to 10
182:29 - and then i'm going to have iteration
182:31 - equals zero
182:32 - i'm going to put
182:35 - i'm going to say iteration plus plus
182:38 - if iteration is greater than max
182:41 - iterations
182:44 - break
182:45 - now this is kind of silly because i
182:46 - could have just said while iteration is
182:49 - less than max iterations but i don't
182:50 - know this is the way i'm doing it
182:53 - we'll clean it up later this int n
182:56 - equals 8 does not need to be in this
182:57 - loop i mean it honestly could just be a
182:59 - global variable
183:00 - but i'm going to put it up here just so
183:01 - i have all the variables i want to mess
183:03 - with
183:06 - and then really
183:12 - ah
183:15 - hold on
183:25 - the order of this stuff is going to be
183:26 - important
183:28 - so
183:29 - zeta starts at zero and the very first
183:32 - time
183:33 - i'm taking zeta squared
183:36 - and then adding c to it
183:49 - so could i make a vector that holds
183:54 - the spherical coordinate and that is c
184:08 - i think that's right so then in the loop
184:20 - zeta equals
184:24 - power i mean this won't work because
184:25 - zeta is a vector
184:29 - power
184:30 - zeta to the n
184:32 - plus
184:33 - c
184:35 - right this is the idea of what i'm doing
184:37 - i'm doing this every single time
184:44 - and the way that i take
184:46 - zeta to the power of n are these
184:48 - formulas
184:55 - so zeta dot x
184:57 - equals nu x
185:00 - plus c dot x
185:06 - oops
185:07 - bad copy paste
185:31 - i'm thinking
185:32 - i'm thinking
186:01 - now maybe what i want to do is do this
186:04 - spherical transformation in a
186:09 - function
186:14 - what am i doing here
186:35 - yes yes yes yes okay so hold on hold on
186:40 - the first thing that happens is i need
186:42 - to get
186:45 - these this should be in the loop
187:10 - you know what i'm going to do this is
187:11 - what i'm going to do
187:13 - p vector
187:20 - i think i want
187:21 - i think it's really going to help me if
187:23 - i have a function to convert
187:25 - from
187:25 - [Music]
187:26 - cartesian to polar
188:03 - i kind of hate that i'm using the p
188:06 - vector for this because i'm putting the
188:08 - r and x the thick and y and the
188:11 - the v in z which is quite confusing
188:14 - because now
188:15 - when i come to do this
188:19 - this is actually like
188:21 - c dot x oh okay i'm gonna write my own
188:24 - spherical
188:26 - vector class
188:29 - might be totally unnecessary but i'm
188:31 - gonna do
188:32 - it you can all i know you're all
188:35 - screaming and throwing tomatoes at your
188:38 - tubular television thing
188:53 - just let me figure this out in my own
188:55 - way please i'm sure i'm doing this wrong
188:57 - but i'll get there eventually
189:14 - so the function
189:16 - returns a spherical object it's
189:20 - basically just like an object that holds
189:22 - three values but i want to be able to
189:23 - name those values r theta and phi like a
189:26 - p vector was a useful data structure but
189:29 - because the naming is cartesian i'm
189:31 - going to get way too confused
189:37 - so this is spherical
189:40 - c
189:41 - is the spherical version of x y z
189:46 - power of c dot r
189:51 - z dot theta
190:00 - and then
190:05 - wait but then what gets added here
190:17 - where's the rest of the pseudo code
190:22 - x plus a yeah
190:28 - oh but i need the cartesian
190:30 - [Music]
190:33 - to add
190:35 - oh
190:37 - oh boy
190:47 - oh there's no
190:48 - this was a mistake
190:51 - i'm getting very close i can feel it
190:59 - oh can i just do this
191:03 - like isn't that what these are
191:14 - and this should be oh hold on hold on
191:30 - i've mixed everything up
191:40 - let's go back to the whiteboard
191:53 - c
191:55 - is x y z
192:03 - so c to the n is defined by what i did
192:07 - and this gives me in my code
192:09 - nu x
192:10 - new y
192:12 - new z
192:14 - then i add c
192:15 - the original xyz to it and then i take
192:18 - this convert it to spherical
192:21 - and do it again to the nth power okay
192:28 - when i said it over there it made sense
192:30 - in my head and now i have to see if i
192:32 - can put that into action here
192:57 - won't it
192:58 - work if i just start with this
193:02 - because
193:10 - by the way why am i getting weird little
193:11 - errors here
193:13 - the variable r does not exist
193:16 - oh
193:20 - i have to define these variables
193:44 - i think this is fine because i'm
193:46 - starting with zero so the spherical
193:49 - coordinate zero zero zero is going to be
193:51 - zero zero zero so i could go through
193:53 - this then add x y z to it
193:57 - and then get the new spherical
193:58 - coordinate
194:00 - put it to the power of n
194:02 - then add x y z to it again et cetera et
194:04 - cetera i think this is good
194:06 - i think i've got it
194:14 - let's just run this code
194:16 - why not it's not going to visualize
194:18 - anything let's see if i get any errors
194:20 - all right
194:24 - and if i were to say like point if i
194:26 - were to multiply these i mean i could
194:28 - just use scale
194:30 - but this math is going to work
194:33 - for every for every pixel there ah okay
194:36 - i think we're getting somewhere so now i
194:38 - just need to figure out and am i in
194:40 - setup no i'm in draw so here's the thing
194:42 - i don't want to calculate the mandelbulb
194:44 - over and over again
194:46 - so i think what i want to do
194:48 - is take this
194:50 - code this entire thing where is the last
194:54 - bracket here it is
194:56 - take this
194:57 - and put it in setup
195:02 - then what i'm going to do is i'm going
195:04 - to create an array of all the points
195:08 - that are within the mandelbulb set
195:10 - itself
195:12 - that'll be an array list of p vectors
195:25 - in other words
195:26 - if at this point instead of drawing a
195:28 - point i just
195:32 - say add new p-vector
195:39 - and i should do something better than
195:40 - just multiplying each value by 100 but
195:43 - that'll be good enough for right now
195:45 - right so right now i'm adding every
195:47 - point i'm doing the mandible math but
195:49 - i'm not checking what the outcome is i'm
195:51 - just doing the manual bulb math and
195:53 - adding every point into this arraylist
195:55 - then in draw
196:16 - i should still see that cube
196:19 - okay
196:20 - now
196:21 - i now all i need to do
196:24 - is determine
196:26 - whether or not
196:27 - i should add the point as part of the
196:30 - mandelbulb set itself
196:34 - so i'm only going to do that if i make
196:37 - it
196:38 - to max iterations if i make it to max
196:41 - iterations that means it is
196:44 - bounded i haven't gotten past some large
196:47 - value so i also need to test if i've
196:50 - gotten to some large value how do i do
196:52 - that
196:54 - well i think the easiest way for me to
196:56 - do that would be to
196:58 - check r
197:01 - r is like the distance from the center
197:03 - so if r keeps going like way way way out
197:08 - and way way out like greater than 16.
197:13 - then break
197:18 - so now only the points where the radius
197:21 - value hasn't gotten past a number the
197:24 - number 16 will make their way into the
197:26 - mandelbulb set itself
197:29 - oh my god
197:31 - what is the chance that when i run the
197:33 - code right now i will see something that
197:35 - looks like the mandelbalm after being in
197:37 - this room for like
197:39 - i don't know i've been in this room for
197:40 - four hours today
197:42 - i mean i was thinking doing a lot of
197:44 - stuff before i even started coding
197:45 - because i was so stressed out
197:48 - oh
197:50 - everybody
197:51 - say your 3d fractal prayer i mean
197:52 - there's no way this is going to work
197:53 - right
197:54 - no chance
197:56 - all right i'm hitting run
198:00 - i can't look
198:01 - wait a second
198:04 - okay that kind of looks like
198:07 - i don't know
198:08 - kind of looks like a mandel bulby thing
198:12 - let's make the dimension 64.
198:17 - oh my goodness
198:19 - okay so here's the thing ah
198:22 - that's the mandelbulb
198:23 - that's the mandelbaum
198:25 - i think that's the mandible
198:30 - there's something funny going on here
198:32 - that i'm realizing
198:33 - which is that
198:35 - i am setting a point
198:40 - how does how does how to say what i'm
198:41 - saying so
198:43 - i i think that i'm gonna let's
198:48 - okay i think i know what i want to do
198:50 - here which is that let me just make n
198:52 - equal to one
198:54 - like what if instead oh no squared so
198:56 - what if i go back to like the mandelbrot
198:58 - set of just doing z equals z squared
199:00 - plus c
199:02 - i think i'm gonna see a sphere
199:05 - uh it's not a sphere but it's like a
199:07 - weird other shape okay wait what if i do
199:09 - one
199:14 - oh yeah well it's kind of like a
199:16 - just like that cube thing right so
199:18 - there's no detail
199:21 - but
199:21 - [Music]
199:25 - so the order makes a difference why is
199:27 - that not a sphere somebody will explain
199:29 - this to me in the comments i thought
199:30 - that would be a sphere
199:38 - but it's running really slow
199:40 - the reason is well i need some kind of
199:42 - prop some kind of device hold on wait
199:44 - there i'll be right back
199:57 - here is a basketball a little miniature
199:59 - basketball that really needs some air
200:00 - bumped into it oh no oh no it's all well
200:03 - it's fine i'm going to make this into
200:04 - the mandible
200:06 - what i have done
200:07 - i'm plotting every point along the
200:10 - surface of this mandelbulb basketball as
200:14 - well as every point on the inside
200:16 - so i think what i want to look for are
200:18 - the points at which
200:20 - the neighbor
200:22 - is
200:23 - a
200:23 - bounded point or a not bounded point
200:25 - right like if i'm looking at where's the
200:27 - edge between this basketball and the
200:30 - rest of the three-dimensional space
200:37 - let me go back to eight
200:39 - so basically
200:41 - as i'm looking at i guess the k is the z
200:44 - axis so i can do it i can just consider
200:47 - any
200:48 - every point along the z axis
200:53 - let's say
200:55 - right before i do this
200:56 - boolean
200:59 - edge
201:03 - so they're going to be
201:04 - the when i start like the manual bulb is
201:06 - in the center so when i start they're
201:09 - going to be
201:10 - not
201:11 - bounded
201:14 - so as soon as i find one
201:18 - that makes it to the end
201:20 - edge is true
201:23 - so as long as it's not
201:25 - the not the edge edge is true
201:32 - um add it to the
201:34 - set
201:36 - let's run this
201:42 - yeah so that's like half the shape
201:44 - you can kind of see it
201:46 - it's just one half of it look it's like
201:48 - the bottom half i'm trying to like get
201:50 - the right zoom here hold on
202:01 - i wonder if you know what
202:02 - let me make
202:06 - can i go up to 128
202:15 - yeah
202:17 - so you can see i'm just getting the
202:19 - bottom half of the mandelbulb
202:22 - because
202:24 - i also need to say
202:27 - if
202:28 - it is an edge
202:32 - here then i can say edge is false
202:46 - i want to know if it's
202:48 - no no no yeah
202:54 - yeah yeah because
202:56 - if it then finds
202:58 - right this is like the edge variable is
203:00 - like a switch like first it's off and it
203:03 - finds a point on the manual bulb in the
203:05 - manual bulb it flips it on and and
203:08 - places that point now it doesn't flip
203:10 - that switch back off until it finds a
203:12 - part that's not so we can flip it off
203:14 - and then find the next one i think this
203:16 - is going to work
203:24 - yeah that's a point cloud mandelbulb
203:28 - look at that that's a point cloud
203:30 - mandelbulb
203:32 - we did it
203:36 - i mean it looks nothing like the beauty
203:38 - of the like fully ray traced rendered
203:40 - colored light lit mandel bulbs but
203:45 - by golly my brain somehow
203:47 - made it from the start of whatever i
203:49 - started today to this and i'm very very
203:52 - happy
203:55 - i'm trying to think of what else i can
203:56 - do here
204:09 - let's try
204:10 - a few things for example let me let's go
204:13 - back to this page
204:30 - oh the number of iterations that's where
204:32 - i would get a sphere
204:35 - so this is useful to look at where it's
204:37 - telling me like
204:39 - how many iterations before i escape is
204:41 - is the level of detail that i would get
204:45 - so for example if i set the max
204:47 - iterations to one
204:52 - i guess still getting a oh i got a plane
204:55 - let me set the max iterations to two
205:01 - weird
205:03 - getting some really weird shapes here
205:19 - well maybe that was not so interesting
205:24 - let's set it to 200 it's gonna take a
205:26 - really long time
205:33 - oh it didn't like that
205:39 - marching cubes could work
205:46 - so many things okay i crashed it all
205:48 - right
205:49 - so i really should um
206:14 - just trying to think of what things i
206:16 - want to do squaring ah yeah okay
206:18 - squaring power of three
206:24 - all right so let me
206:32 - so if i review the original article on
206:34 - which this is based there's a couple
206:36 - things that i could explore which is
206:38 - just ultimately playing around with both
206:42 - if i review the original article on
206:44 - which this is based there's some things
206:45 - that i could explore which is reviewing
206:47 - the number of iterations before i
206:50 - consider it reaching the max iterations
206:55 - and we can see here that
206:57 - iteration 20 is going to give us the
207:00 - most detail
207:01 - and iteration 200 would give us maybe
207:03 - more detail but there's
207:05 - it's not going to be that noticeable
207:07 - even at high resolution so let me change
207:09 - the max iterations to 20.
207:13 - we'll see if that results in anything
207:15 - different
207:21 - you know because this is just a point
207:22 - cloud it's very hard to see that detail
207:26 - but i believe that it's there
207:35 - the other thing i can play with is what
207:37 - value of n am i using and we can see
207:39 - here in this post that these are the
207:42 - shapes that i would get from the power
207:43 - of 2 power of 3 etc this is zooming in
207:46 - and looking at interiors power of 16
207:49 - whoa let's look at that
207:54 - n is 16 here
208:12 - yeah take a look at that crazy
208:15 - fractal death star
208:24 - the other thing that is completely
208:26 - arbitrary in my code is
208:29 - my escape
208:30 - clause
208:32 - the other thing that is completely
208:33 - arbitrary in my code is checking if the
208:36 - radius is greater than 16.
208:39 - i wonder if i should be using a
208:40 - different number for that like what
208:42 - happens if i just say one and let me put
208:44 - this back
208:46 - to eight
208:48 - like am i going to get the same thing
208:57 - let me zoom out a bit more
209:08 - i just had a panic that i wasn't
209:09 - recording to disc
209:10 - that looks kind of similar
209:14 - so there might be a sort of
209:17 - i wonder
209:24 - hello from itp hi itp
209:27 - um
209:30 - so i don't know what that value should
209:32 - be i like that i picked 16.
209:35 - why not
209:45 - i certainly could also increase the
209:47 - stroke weight just to see or i could
209:49 - draw like a box
210:04 - you know maybe i need to add some
210:06 - lighting some transparency all that kind
210:08 - of stuff
210:19 - yeah that makes sense
210:24 - you know
210:26 - since the space that i'm working with is
210:28 - between negative one and one probably
210:31 - getting outside of that space
210:33 - is ultimately
210:35 - um
210:37 - and maybe like a little two would be
210:39 - good just to like leave a little wiggle
210:41 - room there
210:43 - but that might be a nice place to stop
211:26 - let's see what happens if i draw boxes
211:28 - instead of points
211:34 - much slower
211:37 - my resolution is too high right that
211:39 - didn't go anywhere
211:41 - let's not include that all right i think
211:43 - i know what i want to do next
212:00 - okay
212:15 - i could set the rgb
212:16 - um hold on i'm not seeing the chat right
212:19 - now so
212:22 - oh if i remove the stroke
212:24 - the number's two
212:26 - um
212:28 - okay i'm going to do my stop start thing
212:30 - just because i really am at the end here
212:32 - and i want to stop starting i can't
212:33 - believe it's almost three o'clock
212:40 - okay
212:43 - i could yeah um
212:53 - so just for a moment
212:55 - i want to remove pz cam
213:09 - and i want to see it rotate like this so
213:11 - that's the x-axis
213:20 - let's see what we get here
213:46 - oh whoops i want it to be closer to me
213:56 - okay i just wanted to see it spin like
213:58 - that i don't know why but i thought uh
214:01 - if you kind of get this sense of it
214:02 - folding
214:05 - i can actually i just want to make it a
214:06 - little bit bigger
214:12 - one one last try here just to finish
214:15 - this off
214:19 - there we go this is what i wanted to see
214:21 - and that this spinning of it it's sort
214:22 - of like even though i'm spinning this
214:24 - shape it sort of looks like it's folding
214:26 - into itself which i quite like as a sort
214:28 - of aspect of the mantle bulb itself
214:34 - so the thing that i'm really really
214:36 - missing here and that what i've seen
214:38 - other demonstrations on shader toy or
214:41 - with other
214:42 - environments whether it's blender or
214:44 - some 3d environment is actually turning
214:46 - this into a mesh an actual 3d form maybe
214:49 - adding some lighting
214:51 - i think there might be a quick way
214:55 - i can at least
214:56 - see this form
214:58 - um you know there are some processing
215:00 - libraries i believe toxic libs has a
215:03 - volume a set of volume classes that i
215:05 - could just pass it a point cloud and
215:08 - it'll like make the mesh for it but i
215:10 - haven't done this in any order
215:12 - where i could sort of like easily
215:14 - logically just triangulate all the
215:16 - points and make it a nice surface
215:18 - however
215:20 - i have not done this before i think the
215:22 - last time i used mesh lab was probably
215:24 - like five years ago and maybe i'll just
215:26 - sort of speed through this for you let's
215:28 - see if we can get these points into mesh
215:30 - lab to at least
215:32 - render it as a form
215:44 - so mesh lab is open source software for
215:47 - 3d triangular meshes
215:52 - i'm going to download the mac version of
215:54 - it
216:09 - actually no let's not do that
216:15 - putting it here i'm going to run it
216:34 - okay so this is matt
216:38 - just roofing
216:40 - okay so this is mesh lab
216:43 - does anybody know how to use mesh lab
216:45 - is there anybody around that knows how
216:47 - to use mesh lab
216:51 - file import mesh
216:55 - what does it want
216:59 - can i just
217:00 - import a text file text generic ascii
217:03 - point list
217:36 - okay
217:38 - points stored as asc files can be viewed
217:42 - using programs such as mesh lab this is
217:44 - some random site i found on the internet
217:46 - so here are four points of a tetrahedron
217:49 - okay
217:57 - hold on
218:06 - so i'm going to put these
218:10 - i'm going to put these points into a
218:12 - plain text file
218:25 - i named it tetra.asc
218:32 - open
218:40 - no import
218:44 - import
218:50 - tetra asc
218:52 - uh
218:54 - header row
218:56 - separator
218:59 - the separator was just a space right
219:09 - i don't see my points
219:29 - vertices 4 faces 0.
219:32 - well how do i
219:34 - how do i turn it into a mesh
219:42 - i use blender
219:46 - no but i want to use this because i
219:47 - don't know
219:48 - point size
219:50 - oh there are the points
219:56 - ah there we go
220:01 - how do i convert it open okay in one
220:05 - millisecond all files open
220:07 - is there something i need to run to like
220:09 - make it a mesh
220:12 - what does this do
220:15 - what do these buttons do
220:16 - uh
220:19 - that's drawing the points
220:25 - oh there we go
220:27 - what did this do
220:29 - what's this point well that's just dr
220:32 - what
220:36 - oh no that's just a box
220:49 - hold on
220:50 - file let's try this again
220:52 - import raster import mesh
220:58 - open point format space color on
221:02 - parsinger skip
221:05 - well let's try importing i i know how to
221:07 - format the file now all right
221:16 - so where
221:26 - filters remeshing bounding box okay
221:29 - process in right toolbar after selecting
221:32 - points
221:34 - let's try this again
221:44 - um
221:48 - now what happened to the points
222:02 - all right i'm going to import
222:05 - my
222:06 - points
222:12 - so now i need to go back to my code
222:16 - and
222:17 - instead of just adding all of these
222:20 - points into an arraylist i want to save
222:23 - them to a text file
222:32 - [Music]
222:35 - i don't know how many points i'm going
222:36 - to have let's use a string list
222:49 - a string list is a particular kind of
222:51 - data structure in ja in in processing
222:53 - for storing an arbitrary number of
222:55 - strings
223:15 - and append i believe it's append
223:19 - so now i'm making a string of x space y
223:23 - space z into that string list
223:26 - and then at the very end of setup before
223:29 - i go on i'm gonna do save strings
223:34 - mandelbulb.txt
223:39 - points
223:42 - our points
223:44 - comma
223:46 - mandelbulb.txt all right let's look at
223:48 - the save strings reference
224:03 - file name goes first the string oh it
224:05 - has to be an array so i assume if i go
224:07 - to string list there's probably a
224:09 - function that converts it to an array
224:11 - array perfect
224:30 - so now this should save all of those to
224:32 - a text file
224:45 - and let's take a look at that text file
224:49 - these should be all the points
224:52 - of the mandelbulb itself
225:00 - filters point set surface reconstruction
225:02 - poisson thank you so now
225:05 - now i can go into mesh lab
225:08 - import
225:11 - import mandalbulb.txt
225:15 - xyz separator space hopefully this
225:17 - doesn't crash
225:19 - all right i see it
225:21 - that's the mandelbulb
225:23 - now
225:25 - somebody in the chat told me
225:29 - filters
225:31 - point set
225:34 - marching cubes point cloud
225:36 - smooth normals
225:38 - compute normals
225:41 - surface reconstruction i don't see that
225:44 - um
225:45 - [Music]
225:46 - mesh layer normal smoothing
225:52 - let's try marching cubes
225:57 - apply
226:15 - i don't think that did anything
226:26 - do i have to select all the points
226:42 - i have no idea what i'm doing here
226:58 - and delete these
227:07 - filters remeshing surface reconstruction
227:10 - okay let's try that
227:12 - filters
227:16 - other
227:29 - remeshing
227:35 - surface reconstruction
227:38 - there's ball pivoting screened possible
227:40 - let's try ball pivoting
227:42 - okay
227:47 - did it crash
227:57 - i'm trying this again
228:03 - file import mesh
228:24 - screen poisson
228:36 - requires correct per vertex normals
228:42 - try enabling pre-clean option and retry
228:46 - i don't have correct vertex normals not
228:49 - about nothing about my per vertex
228:51 - normals are correct
228:54 - pre-clean i'm just gonna pre-clean
228:57 - everything that'll do it
229:07 - i think i have to give up
229:16 - filters normals compute normals for
229:18 - point sets
229:21 - okay hold on
229:25 - where did it go
229:31 - let's start over
229:35 - i'm gonna try this one more time
229:39 - let's close without saving
229:44 - and then i'll just work on this later
229:45 - and show it after the fact um
229:52 - okay
229:55 - okay
229:57 - filters point set compute normals for
230:00 - point set
230:02 - okay
230:05 - oh look at that
230:07 - okay now we're getting somewhere i got
230:08 - some normals
230:11 - all right now
230:13 - filters
230:15 - remeshing
230:18 - simplification want to like surface
230:21 - something surface reconstruction
230:23 - screened poisson
230:29 - apply
230:33 - ooh
230:36 - what the
230:42 - look at my mandelbulb
230:44 - i go inside the mandelbulb whoa
230:47 - i'm inside the mandelbulb
230:54 - so as you can see
230:56 - i'm struggling to figure out
230:59 - how to go from my processing point cloud
231:04 - of the mandelbulb itself
231:07 - and somehow turn it into a 3d form that
231:10 - has a surface to it that i can light
231:13 - that is a mesh that is triangulated
231:15 - that's going to have to be the subject
231:17 - for another video or for all of you to
231:19 - tell me how you did it in the comments i
231:22 - guess i have to learn shaders now oh i
231:24 - have to learn shaders now but hopefully
231:27 - you enjoyed this coding challenge i did
231:30 - somehow
231:31 - make the mandal bulb even if this was a
231:33 - total train wreck
231:35 - and
231:36 - i'm just excited to see if you can take
231:38 - this and do something more with it play
231:41 - around with the variables don't worry
231:43 - about reproducing the perfect beautiful
231:46 - rendered mandelbulb itself what can you
231:49 - make can you make this happen in
231:51 - javascript i bet you if you use like 3js
231:53 - i might try to do a bunch of these
231:55 - things and show them to you flying up
231:57 - here on the screen or revisit them in a
231:59 - future live stream but i've been at this
232:01 - for like an entire day now so i've gotta
232:04 - go thank you for watching i love you all
232:07 - so much
232:08 - i really do this was hard goodbye
232:18 - all right everyone
232:21 - that's all that i've got for today oh i
232:23 - have a list i have a list of other
232:24 - things i was going to do
232:27 - but how long has this live stream been
232:34 - uh
232:35 - invert normals okay okay hold on
232:42 - how do i go back to this okay
232:45 - can i go back
232:47 - invert normals
232:50 - you guys got me
232:59 - hold on let me start over
233:02 - let me save
233:10 - i'm going to do this on my own time
233:17 - okay
233:21 - i don't understand this program at all
233:31 - i'm just going to try it one more time
233:33 - import mesh
233:38 - what did i do filters
233:41 - point set
233:43 - compute normals
233:47 - flip normals
233:48 - will that invert them
233:59 - subdivision surfaces
234:01 - surface ring
234:21 - oh that might have done it it's just not
234:23 - lit or anything
234:25 - can i save this now
234:29 - like how do i add some lighting
234:36 - i think i might have kind of done it
234:39 - like when i zoom out okay i gotta go
234:42 - thank you everybody i'm sorry that i'm
234:43 - not gonna get to this other stuff i
234:46 - can't believe it is three o'clock
234:48 - uh how long has this stream been going
234:50 - does anybody know
234:52 - um
234:54 - if anybody wants to continue with this
234:56 - um
234:58 - come and uh ping me on discord the
235:01 - coding train discord i i'm totally brain
235:04 - dead right now
235:06 - um i i felt like this was something i
235:08 - really succeeded at and yet now i'm not
235:10 - so sure
235:11 - but there it is my mandelbulb
235:16 - thank you all for watching uh thank you
235:18 - to
235:20 - um
235:21 - ai camp for being today's sponsor uh if
235:24 - you're looking if you're if you're
235:25 - looking for a summer camp a
235:27 - project-based learning
235:29 - if you're
235:30 - in middle or high school between the
235:31 - ages of 13 and 18 you can go to that
235:34 - link for the application scholarship
235:35 - application
235:37 - um and i'm going to say goodbye
235:39 - uh parker smart thank you
235:41 - elissai
235:42 - in italy
235:43 - chile i have all these members i really
235:45 - need to thank you all four hours this
235:48 - this is all i can do i hope i don't have
235:49 - any emergency text messages
235:54 - not really i'm gonna go
235:57 - i'm i don't think i'm i don't know if i
235:58 - can ever i was gonna come back and live
236:00 - stream tomorrow to do the uh the rest of
236:03 - the end body stuff but i don't even know
236:05 - after today i'm gonna be able to do that
236:06 - but in the next week oh oh before i go i
236:09 - really really need help
236:12 - um
236:13 - i really need help thinking of something
236:14 - for pi day so join the discord coding
236:17 - tray i don't think this button's going
236:18 - to work
236:19 - um no codingtrain.com discord
236:22 - um
236:24 - and uh send me your pi da ideas i i i
236:26 - gotta go i'm done
236:28 - put a fork in me
236:30 - i am done
236:31 - uh
236:32 - as always i always forget that this stop
236:34 - i'll see you all
236:36 - thank you so much stream is over
236:49 - [Music]
237:31 - never forget this stop i'm going to do
237:34 - this this star this dot this dot this
237:36 - dot song never forget the this dot
237:39 - somebody composed that song for me
