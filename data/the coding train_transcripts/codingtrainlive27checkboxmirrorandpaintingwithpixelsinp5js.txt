00:01 - hello welcome my name is Dan and I am
00:05 - broadcasting live from the school for
00:07 - poetic computation in the West Village
00:09 - New York City there is a river behind me
00:11 - there is a brick wall that way I guess
00:13 - this is a green wall behind me actually
00:15 - that's not a river that's my screen I'm
00:18 - kind of still waking up I feel like it's
00:20 - been so long since I was last here but
00:22 - it probably hasn't been um but I have
00:25 - some new lights so I think hopefully you
00:28 - can hear me uh hopefully this looks
00:30 - pretty good I've got some new lights in
00:32 - here it's brighter unfortunately these
00:33 - are H hallogen lights and so I was
00:36 - trying to avoid using them because of
00:37 - the heat that they emit but I do think
00:39 - the quality of the imagery will be
00:42 - better today do have some LED lighting
00:44 - over here as you can see this glow
00:46 - coming up here and then hopefully this
00:48 - key should be pretty good and I don't
00:51 - look as orange as I have in the past I'm
00:54 - looking at it looks pretty good um what
00:57 - I would like to know from anyone
00:59 - watching and who is either in the chat
01:01 - either on Twitch or YouTube is is the
01:03 - audio okay is there any crackling
01:06 - skipping breaking up or the levels good
01:09 - and is the image quality good can you
01:11 - read this code uh can you see me do I
01:15 - look okay and in particular um can you
01:20 - read what's on this whiteboard and
01:21 - actually I'm going to take a moment here
01:24 - to erase what's on this
01:26 - whiteboard doesn't seem as bright as it
01:29 - did earlier today when I had first
01:31 - turned that light on I moved it further
01:33 - away but um the question would
01:37 - be you know what's the sort of focus and
01:40 - quality of this how does this particular
01:41 - image look I'm going to take a look over
01:43 - in my preview screen looks decent I'm
01:47 - watching myself
01:50 - now um I think it looks okay so nobody's
01:54 - uh I don't know if twitch chat is going
01:58 - the twitch I'm gonna not focus okay so
02:02 - um I'm back please let me know if the
02:04 - audio is okay I would really like to
02:05 - know that oh I'm over here there we go
02:08 - um everything is okay for me thank you
02:11 - um so what I'm going to do uh I'm GNA
02:14 - let me let me let me try to sort of get
02:16 - situated
02:17 - here I am currently working on a lot of
02:22 - different tutorial topics let me pull up
02:26 - My overall
02:27 - list uh get the browser going here and
02:30 - let me go to this so I keep this
02:33 - particular gist which has a lot of
02:36 - topics um and this is where I'm hoping
02:39 - to get to although get get get so I have
02:43 - like some big topics that I want to do
02:46 - that'll be a series of videos uh
02:48 - probably you know five or six on Chrome
02:50 - extensions two or three on Raspberry Pi
02:52 - two or three on neural network stuff
02:53 - maybe I'm going to do that and then uh
02:55 - what I'm what I'm going to do actually
02:57 - uh first though is a whole set of
02:59 - tutorials about git and GitHub which
03:00 - people have been asking for but I'm not
03:02 - doing that today because I am still uh
03:06 - um now I feel like actually this setup
03:08 - is finished so as long as this goes well
03:09 - today it doesn't get too hot and the
03:11 - Lighting and Sound seems to work I'll be
03:12 - ready for some of these larger topics
03:14 - but I have been last week when I was
03:17 - last
03:18 - here uh I recorded if I go to
03:22 - youtube.com shiffman and oh look I'm
03:25 - live
03:26 - now uh if I go to I don't know where uh
03:31 - playlists and here this one so
03:35 - um last week I recorded I guess I got
03:38 - through four videos I looked at just the
03:40 - basics of live video and capture into P5
03:44 - I looked at uh making this sort of like
03:47 - video photo booth thing uh pixel array
03:50 - and made a little brightness mirror I'll
03:52 - run that example in a second so what I
03:54 - would like to do today I think is make a
03:56 - few more tutorials one is I thought we
03:59 - we would do I would make a tutorial
04:01 - about something a little bit strange in
04:03 - that taking the pixels from live video
04:06 - and mapping those to Dom elements um so
04:09 - make like a mirror with checkboxes
04:11 - that's what I was thinking of doing uh I
04:13 - want to look at um kind of a painting
04:17 - thing um and I want to look at um maybe
04:23 - slit scan somebody had asked about and
04:25 - maybe look at seriously. JS I'll see if
04:27 - that works uh okay so let's look and I
04:33 - see a bunch of people 14 people in the
04:36 - chat which is great people are saying hi
04:38 - like hearing that
04:42 - um uh somebody on Twitch is saying a
04:44 - slight fuzz in the focus overall but
04:47 - probably um if I walk close to the
04:49 - camera that's what happens so uh so
04:52 - everyone says things are good so um so
04:56 - um now that people have joined let me
04:57 - just recap sort of like a quick intro my
05:01 - name is Dan uh I uh work
05:05 - on different open source projects but in
05:07 - particular I spent a lot of time working
05:09 - on tutorials and examples and
05:11 - documentation for processing and p5js
05:13 - processing being something built on top
05:15 - of java P5 J being something built on
05:17 - top of JavaScript and I have a new
05:19 - recording studio at um a space here
05:21 - called the school for poetic computation
05:23 - and I'm just trying to make lots of
05:25 - video tutorials so here's another day of
05:27 - doing that I what I do is I broadcast
05:29 - live so you can ask questions in the
05:31 - chat or you can tell me things that I
05:33 - got wrong and then while I'm
05:35 - broadcasting live periodically I hit a
05:37 - separate record button to make these you
05:40 - know somewhere between 10 or 15 minute
05:42 - tutorial chunks which I then upload
05:44 - later to YouTube as Standalone videos so
05:46 - that's kind of the summary of where I'm
05:47 - at um this is kind of my list of topics
05:50 - I'm going to um get started with making
05:52 - this checkbox mirror first um and uh I'm
05:57 - looking at different cameras to that's
05:59 - the camera I'm looking at now and um but
06:02 - if anything's a Miss please let me know
06:03 - in the
06:05 - chat okay
06:09 - uh okay um so let's see here I'm gonna
06:14 - um close this close this so one thing
06:17 - I'll mention right now is that I'm
06:19 - working in as using Sublime Text as my
06:22 - text editor a lot of people have
06:24 - mentioned in various comments that they
06:25 - love uh Adam which is another text
06:28 - editor development environment Maybe
06:29 - download that at some point and use that
06:31 - actually maybe not right now um and then
06:34 - the other thing that I do oops it seems
06:36 - to be closed is I will run a little web
06:39 - server on my
06:41 - computer uh come on
06:44 - Terminal and you can maybe you can see
06:47 - that make it a little
06:50 - bigger
06:51 - uh I run a little web server on my and
06:55 - let's see where am I uh desktop
07:02 - uh using
07:04 - python so once that little server is
07:07 - running I can go to my browser oops I
07:09 - forgot that this was there and I can
07:10 - type in Local Host and I can see that I
07:13 - have all the examples I've been making
07:15 - and the last thing that I did
07:24 - whoops not sure why this is not
07:28 - working
07:30 - no error what's going on
07:35 - here
07:39 - uh
07:46 - huh
07:48 - huh this is I'm just trying to run my
07:50 - last example I don't know why it's
07:52 - failing uh let's restart
07:58 - Chrome everything seems
08:00 - fine we'll try running some of the other
08:04 - examples I even see this red light here
08:08 - but my green light is not on on the
08:10 - laptop so let's go um let's look at some
08:12 - of the other examples let's look at this
08:16 - one why is the live video dead on my
08:20 - computer perhaps I should just restart
08:23 - let's um let's run processing for a
08:27 - second all right so I'm into a little
08:29 - technical glitch before I get started
08:31 - making this first tutorial I need for
08:33 - the live video to actually work
08:37 - um somebody wrote in the comments your
08:40 - library for using the camera with
08:42 - processing doesn't work be glad to see
08:44 - if I can offer any help there but I
08:45 - would need more specifics which Library
08:48 - what do you mean by doesn't work is
08:49 - there um right now I just want to see
08:52 - something
08:53 - else
08:56 - uh uh
08:58 - examples
09:00 - oops uh video
09:03 - capture
09:04 - uh let's just I don't know open any of
09:08 - these does this
09:12 - work I wonder if
09:15 - uh all right I'm gonna try restarting
09:18 - this computer this doesn't seem to be
09:20 - working either all right one more thing
09:23 - to
09:24 - try I'm just for some reason I'm not
09:26 - getting any signal from my uh webcam
09:30 - so if I say new uh movie recording I
09:33 - believe it
09:35 - [Music]
09:36 - should FaceTime HD camera built in it
09:39 - must be like caught somewhere
09:41 - something's like using it so I have a
09:44 - feeling that
09:48 - uh just
09:50 - restarting uh the
09:55 - computer all right close so you can see
09:59 - I've gone blank I'm floating in space
10:02 - now nowhere to be found myter is
10:05 - rebooting I'm going to see if there's
10:07 - any other
10:08 - comments uh it's craft cake who wrote
10:12 - the library for using the camera doesn't
10:13 - work is Right didn't seem to work come
10:16 - on computer you can see
10:18 - [Music]
10:23 - this loading loading
10:28 - loading I'm entertaining myself much too
10:31 - much so I don't know what to say while
10:33 - I'm waiting I I will I will use my magic
10:35 - water this is my other trick this is you
10:36 - can see it's not really that magic oh
10:38 - did you hear that
10:40 - sound that's the restart sound so as
10:42 - soon as this thing
10:44 - restarts here's what I'm going to look
10:46 - at doing um so what the the tutorial
10:48 - that I want to do involves looking at
10:50 - every single Pixel and doing a
10:51 - thresholding effect meaning let's see I
10:54 - want to log in as the processing user
10:57 - type in the password uh um which means I
11:01 - want to look at every single Pixel and
11:03 - determine the brightness of that pixel
11:04 - if it's greater than or less than a
11:06 - certain
11:07 - thresold then I'm going to either draw a
11:10 - white or a black
11:12 - pixel uh this seems to have
11:15 - restarted um let's just let's just look
11:17 - at quick time for a second see if that
11:20 - uh seems to have come
11:23 - back uh there we go there we go camera
11:27 - seems to be working guess I should have
11:29 - tested that before I started
11:31 - streaming uh am I in the right directory
11:33 - yep I am so I just need to get Chrome
11:37 - back
11:37 - up and I need to get Sublime back up
11:41 - look at this and I need to go back to
11:44 - there and go to here and Shrink that and
11:50 - there we go so this is what I had hoped
11:51 - would happen before so this is the last
11:53 - example that I made
11:55 - whoops which involves just taking all
11:58 - right I Was high-fiving Myself um which
12:01 - involves taking a low resolution capture
12:04 - we can see it down here this is very low
12:07 - resolution and what I'm doing is I'm
12:08 - reading every pixel of that of this like
12:11 - video that's coming in from the camera
12:13 - and I am mapping it to a rectangle on
12:16 - the screen and those rectangles are
12:18 - getting bigger for brighter pixels and
12:20 - smaller for darker pixels okay
12:26 - um so uh
12:30 - um okay so sorry I'm noticing there's a
12:33 - comment which I will see if I can answer
12:35 - in a second I'm GNA fix this camera
12:39 - sorry I just had a little camera mishap
12:41 - um okay so
12:44 - UMO rudo if I pronounce that correctly
12:47 - writes I have a problem using the
12:49 - brightness mirror effect the image
12:50 - freeze when I open it in my browser um I
12:53 - uploaded the code so um to uh GitHub
12:56 - repository um that's linked to the video
12:59 - so check to see if your code matches I
13:02 - you know it might just
13:03 - be you know try try restarting your
13:06 - computer try a different browser try a
13:07 - different computer there might be
13:08 - something just some glitchy thing
13:10 - happening in your particular browser
13:11 - it's sort of hard to say if you're
13:12 - getting a freezing effect um okay so uh
13:15 - I'm going to make a video tutorial in a
13:17 - second but first I want to even see if
13:19 - this idea works so I'm going to sort of
13:22 - just test out this idea and I'm going to
13:24 - go to finder here uh my video examples
13:28 - and I'm going to make one called 05 a
13:32 - checkbox
13:34 - mirror and I'm going to close this and
13:37 - go
13:38 - here and go back and okay so this should
13:42 - look similar to what we had before so
13:45 - I'm going to change from drawing
13:48 - rectangles to a canvas and actually make
13:50 - a grid of Dom Elements which is going to
13:52 - be a little bit
13:56 - crazy I hear footsteps
14:02 - hello okay so um where was I I am going
14:08 - to uh modify this example for a second
14:12 - to demonstrate a particular idea which
14:18 - is let's say that what I do is just do a
14:22 - a sort of threshold test so let's say
14:25 - what I'm saying is if you remember if
14:27 - you watched the previous video if you
14:29 - didn't kind of get your mind to catch up
14:31 - for a second but what I what I'm doing
14:33 - here is looking at every single Pixel
14:35 - getting the red green and blue values
14:36 - adding them together dividing by three
14:39 - to get the average brightness of each
14:40 - pixel and a threshold effect means if
14:44 - the brightness is greater than some
14:46 - threshold do this if it's less than that
14:49 - threshold do something else and that um
14:52 - and let's make that threshold
14:53 - arbitrarily now 127 which is kind of
14:55 - like halfway between 0 and
14:57 - 255 and and what I'm going to say is I'm
15:00 - going to fill 255 if I'm above that
15:03 - threshold and I'm going to fill zero if
15:06 - I'm below that threshold and I am going
15:10 - to draw then draw a rectangle so I'm
15:14 - kind of simplifying this example
15:17 - now in a way back to it's it's similar
15:20 - to what it was before but you can see
15:22 - now I'm always drawing a um I'm always
15:26 - drawing a rectangle and you can see that
15:28 - with there's only two colors being drawn
15:30 - black or white but I'm able to um but
15:35 - really convey the content of the video
15:37 - even just with um even just with that
15:40 - simple uh um kind of threshold effect H
15:43 - this is good that I'm like wandering
15:45 - around saying all sorts of words that
15:46 - don't make any sense because I'm I'm GNA
15:48 - about to I'm I'm I'm gonna about to I'm
15:51 - in a moment I will actually kind of go
15:53 - through a tutorial
15:55 - here uh uh okay um
15:59 - okay so what do I want to do with this
16:00 - next the thing that is important here is
16:02 - I want to be able to adjust that
16:04 - threshold so the the thing that I'll do
16:06 - there is I want to create a uh slider
16:12 - and I'm going to say uh slider equals
16:15 - create slider and the threshold should
16:17 - go between 0 and 255 and start at
16:22 - 127
16:24 - and then what I can do is here
16:32 - instead of testing if the brightness is
16:34 - just greater than a hardcoded value 127
16:38 - I can always get the existing value of
16:41 - the
16:42 - slider
16:46 - and uh and now we should be able to see
16:49 - how this affects it right the threshold
16:51 - is really high or really low and you can
16:53 - see like I don't know what works best
16:57 - this is kind of interesting you can see
16:58 - the sort of like low resolution Contours
17:00 - of my face now what is the question
17:04 - would be here what so I want to replace
17:06 - all this with checkboxes that's my next
17:08 - step I'm going to do this twice I'm
17:10 - doing this now to figure it out and then
17:12 - I'm going to do it again as a kind of
17:14 - tutorial although both of these are
17:15 - really tutorials here um okay so what
17:18 - I'm going to do
17:19 - is I'm
17:21 - [Music]
17:26 - um oh look at that uh okay sorry I
17:29 - shouldn't read Twitter a while I was
17:31 - noticing there were some tweets about
17:32 - Atlas uh the O'Reilly engine that I used
17:35 - to write the learning processing book
17:36 - shutting down but anyway that aside here
17:39 - uh I'm turning look I'm turning picking
17:41 - my phone this is my phone putting it on
17:44 - airplane mode okay no more notifications
17:48 - I don't need any like CNN headlines put
17:50 - that away okay now uh what I want to do
17:54 - is get rid of this let's leave create
17:56 - canvas there for a second
18:00 - so what is the video's height and width
18:05 - the video's height and width is width
18:08 - divided by V scale height divided by V
18:10 - scale um so I want to make a grid of
18:13 - checkboxes that exactly that size so
18:17 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
18:18 - make a variable called columns for calls
18:21 - for columns which is width divided by V
18:24 - scale and I also want to floor that
18:27 - because I I think it'll be a um it will
18:30 - be a whole number but let's just do that
18:33 - just in case to protect here uh
18:36 - rows uh height divided by V scale and so
18:40 - I'm gonna I just want to have those in I
18:43 - want to have those in variables which I
18:45 - think will be particularly useful uh and
18:48 - then what I want to do is I want to
18:51 - say for VAR I uh x equals z x is less
18:57 - than the number of columns
19:01 - x++ and then do the same thing with Y
19:05 - but Y is for
19:13 - rows oops what I want to do ah what I
19:17 - want to do uh is
19:19 - uh what I want to do is say create
19:24 - checkbox I think that's how you do it in
19:26 - P5 create checkbox and see what
19:31 - happens there we go see all these
19:33 - checkboxes now I have all these
19:35 - checkboxes I can check them and uncheck
19:37 - them so that's the right idea now I want
19:39 - them to
19:40 - be uh I want them to be the
19:43 - exact uh right now they're just like you
19:46 - can see how their the the wrapping is
19:50 - based on the width of the browser itself
19:54 - H so what I want I need them to be
19:57 - exactly in that grid
19:58 - the other thing is I need to store I
20:00 - need to have a reference to all of them
20:01 - so I can like act on them so one thing I
20:04 - need to do is not just call create
20:06 - checkbox but I need to say something
20:08 - like
20:10 - um uh I'll call this uh check I'll call
20:14 - this boxes I need to make an array
20:16 - called
20:18 - boxes and then what I'm going to do is
20:20 - I'm going to say a VAR box equals create
20:23 - checkbox and boxes. push boox so I'm
20:27 - also going to put them into an
20:30 - array I probably should if I'm doing
20:33 - this create some sort of like maybe div
20:38 - that everything gets like put into let's
20:40 - do that I don't know if this is a good
20:42 - idea or not I'm figuring this out then
20:44 - I'm GNA erase it all and do it again but
20:47 - let's just say I make like a div I'm my
20:51 - HTML file and I call it uh
20:56 - mirror so what I want to do is
21:01 - now for each box I want to say box
21:05 - parent mirror so that means all of them
21:08 - will go in that div after I make each
21:12 - one there we go so we can see that
21:14 - they're there at the top now but now I
21:17 - should be able to do something where
21:20 - maybe I can make the div a certain width
21:23 - maybe I should put I should put line
21:24 - breaks probably or maybe I should
21:26 - absolute position the check check boox
21:28 - hard to decide what to do here kind of
21:31 - don't want to Absolute position them I
21:32 - want them to maintain their sort of
21:34 - natural flow so to speak so I certainly
21:39 - I could put a line break after so right
21:43 - these are the X I'm doing every column
21:46 - I'm doing every X first which
21:49 - means uh yes so I want to do the Y I
21:51 - want to do all the xes I want the X to
21:53 - be the interior Loop this is one of the
21:54 - few instances where this actually
21:57 - matters right because after I do each
21:59 - row I could say something like box I
22:03 - could say VAR P equals create P put
22:06 - nothing in it like make a blank
22:07 - paragraph element and then say p. parent
22:11 - also mirror like so after I make a whole
22:13 - bunch of check boxes I put a paragraph
22:15 - like an empty paragraph This is a bad
22:17 - idea yeah so that
22:20 - worked but it left all this space in
22:22 - between them so I think what would be
22:24 - better is just to say create span and
22:27 - put in the
22:29 - span just a line break maybe I should
22:32 - make that a div I don't
22:33 - know somebody who knows HTML elements
22:36 - can tell me there we go there we go
22:39 - that's what I'm looking for so there is
22:41 - sort of the problem if the browser
22:42 - window isn't wide enough it does wrap
22:44 - there's probably some like style CSS
22:47 - style that I could apply to force it
22:49 - like make sure it doesn't wrap somebody
22:51 - could probably tell me that if you
22:54 - know um or probably actually I want
22:57 - wonder if I just make the div like um a
23:01 - certain width right like so if I add
23:04 - some style here is anybody watching this
23:08 - are you in the somebody in the chat like
23:09 - say something because I've sort of lost
23:12 - uh it does say that 21 people are
23:14 - watching but um I would like to know if
23:16 - anyone's actually if this if my audio is
23:18 - still working and all that so if I
23:22 - add uh something like
23:26 - this like a fixed width to that div does
23:30 - that
23:32 - work hey that worked I don't know what
23:34 - the right width is let me let me see
23:38 - like
23:39 - uh let me give it a background color
23:42 - just so I can see
23:44 - it that's about right
23:47 - actually we'll leave it at that so so
23:50 - that's good so that uh that makes it
23:52 - like a fixed width I don't need that
23:54 - background color how do you comment
23:55 - something out in CSS like this right
24:01 - okay so now we've got this so what I
24:03 - want to do right like right now you can
24:05 - see down
24:07 - here let's let's get a good threshold
24:09 - going kind of like this as the threshold
24:12 - so what I want to do is I want to see
24:14 - maybe I want to see checks for white
24:17 - pixels and um no checks for black pixels
24:22 - I'm not sure so let's give that a try
24:24 - the other thing is I don't really want
24:25 - the canvas anymore but I'm going to
24:26 - leave it there just for
24:28 - reference so as I'm looping through the
24:32 - video I
24:35 - um I need
24:37 - to I'm trying to decide if I should make
24:40 - this array a two-dimensional
24:44 - array doesn't really okay so I want to
24:46 - look up the correct checkbox in that
24:48 - array let's see if that works so uh um I
24:51 - don't know if
24:53 - this so I don't have the um X Plus
24:58 - y
24:59 - times uh
25:01 - columns and then if I say
25:04 - boxes
25:05 - index
25:07 - checked
25:10 - true this is another index I'm looking
25:13 - up probably doing something bad here I I
25:16 - don't remember what the
25:17 - P5 function is for setting a box to be
25:21 - checked or
25:22 - not let's just pretend it's
25:26 - that uncaught reference calls is not
25:29 - defined ah okay so these need to be
25:32 - Global
25:35 - variables uh so I can use them I mean I
25:38 - could have used just video dowith but I
25:41 - kind of like having those in
25:44 - variables oh look at that it worked
25:49 - so so let me do where's my threshold
25:52 - there we go now can you
25:56 - see boy it's kind of kind of hard to see
25:58 - that but you can see that the checks are
26:01 - going on and off I'm not really getting
26:03 - the visual effect that I had hoped for
26:05 - it's not there's not that high a
26:08 - contrast between having a checked and
26:09 - not checked it
26:12 - works I'm trying to think maybe if I put
26:16 - um I don't know if anybody has any ideas
26:18 - I mean I could sort of play with this
26:23 - threshold you know that's oh maybe what
26:26 - I want is the inverse oh I know what I
26:30 - want uh maybe what I want is this I want
26:34 - to say false true and then what's the
26:38 - Threshold at right now it's like I
26:40 - should figure out what that is and set
26:43 - it there by
26:44 - default
26:47 - uh right that's better so you can see
26:51 - there I am
26:54 - checkbox checkbox Dom element mirror
26:58 - okay so that's uh so it does work people
27:00 - are
27:02 - watching uh and saying
27:04 - hi okay that's nice of you guys okay so
27:07 - I think that this works so now I'm going
27:10 - to have a little water
27:14 - here it's actually not getting it's a
27:17 - very cold day in New York which is
27:18 - probably helping the fact that it's not
27:19 - getting super hot in here even with
27:21 - these new lights so that's kind of
27:24 - promising um okay anybody have questions
27:28 - or comments about this particular
27:30 - example I'm going to now hit um I'm
27:33 - going to kind of go back to the code and
27:35 - I'm going to hit start over and I'm
27:37 - going to try to make this example in 10
27:39 - minutes kind of diagramming and
27:41 - sketching out um anything that I need to
27:45 - do to cover it my brain is so not
27:47 - working today bad it was was kind of out
27:50 - late last night it's a long story it's
27:52 - not very it's not as interesting as it
27:53 - might sound um okay um I'm going to
27:57 - erase
27:58 - this I'm going to cycle these
28:07 - cameras is
28:09 - 110 right
28:13 - now so what I want to do uh actually is
28:16 - make sure I save this code
28:18 - somewhere um just in case I totally
28:21 - screw it up and can't figure out what I
28:23 - did
28:25 - um let's just save a backup of it in
28:28 - like text edit or
28:34 - something and then I'm going to go back
28:38 - to this
28:43 - example which was this and I am going
28:48 - [Music]
28:49 - to I am going to make a tutorial how
28:53 - about radio buttons that is a great
28:55 - suggestion the the reason why I'm not
28:57 - going to do it's a really good
28:58 - suggestion so visually the effect might
29:00 - be better with radio buttons um the P5
29:04 - um API for radio buttons is a little bit
29:06 - uh trickier um and because it radio
29:10 - button is kind of like a collection of
29:12 - things and their options it's more like
29:13 - a drop down kind of menu so I'm going to
29:17 - um I think it'll I think it would be
29:19 - worth doing but I think it'll it makes
29:21 - for a cleaner video just to demonstrate
29:23 - with the check boxes but that is a great
29:25 - suggestion yeah a CSS background on
29:27 - would definitely help so I might I might
29:29 - do that um let's see the twitch thing by
29:34 - the way doesn't seem to be taking off
29:35 - very much I've got 22 people watching on
29:37 - YouTube and three people watching on
29:39 - Twitch but I'll leave it running see
29:41 - what happens okay um so let's go let's
29:45 - see um so hold on let me minimize
29:50 - this and let me get code up
29:54 - great and this ah I'm going to take this
29:57 - out
30:03 - out
30:05 - in and I'm going to take this out going
30:08 - to show how to do
30:14 - this okay just getting myself
30:17 - ready
30:18 - [Music]
30:19 - and here we go last
30:23 - check okay going to try to make this
30:26 - checkbox mirror in 10
30:29 - minutes explaining every piece of it
30:32 - talking to the camera with
30:34 - enthusiasm and making
30:37 - sense uh okay here we
30:44 - go hello in this video I'm going to take
30:47 - this example which is currently I called
30:49 - a brightness mirror where each pixel of
30:52 - the image is drawn as a rectangle
30:54 - brighter pixels bigger rectangle darker
30:56 - pixels smaller rectangle I'm going to
30:58 - turn this example into what I'll call
31:01 - the checkbox mirror so instead of
31:03 - drawing to an HTML 5 canvas based on a
31:06 - video Source or an image source I want
31:08 - to create Dom elements checkboxes that
31:11 - get checked or unchecked based on the
31:12 - brightness of a pixel and incidentally
31:15 - while doing this we're going to look at
31:17 - an image processing Effect called a
31:18 - thresholding effect so I'm just going to
31:20 - Dive Right In um if you uh into this
31:24 - code example which was covered in the
31:25 - previous video which you can go back and
31:27 - watch watch if you haven't but I'm going
31:28 - to Dive Right In and start making it so
31:29 - let's go over to the code and the main
31:32 - thing the main sort of piece here in the
31:34 - code is that for every pixel I'm getting
31:37 - a brightness value that brightness value
31:39 - is the red plus the green plus the blue
31:41 - divided by three the average of the red
31:43 - green and blue components of the color
31:45 - so a threshold effect is an effect where
31:47 - you say ah there is a given threshold
31:51 - 127 any pixel that has a brightness over
31:54 - 127 I want to do something any pixel
31:57 - that has a brightness less than 127 I
31:59 - want to do something else typically I
32:01 - might assign the pixel value for
32:03 - anything over 127 to White and anything
32:06 - less than 127 to Black so let's do
32:08 - something like that I can say if bright
32:11 - is greater than
32:13 - threshold fill 255 so just anything
32:17 - above 127 make it
32:20 - 255 anything below 20 127 make it zero
32:24 - now I could set pixels but since I'm
32:26 - doing drawing stuff I'm not going to
32:27 - bother with setting pixels I'm just
32:29 - going to go I don't need to do this
32:30 - mapping anymore to a size of a rectangle
32:32 - I'm just going to go right down get rid
32:34 - of this fill and just draw a rectangle
32:39 - at the full size that is either white or
32:42 - black based on that threshold so let me
32:44 - Zoom back out Let me refresh this and we
32:47 - should
32:48 - see now you can sort of now you see
32:50 - exactly what I'm talking about each
32:52 - rectangle in the screen is is either
32:55 - white or back and you can see how it's
32:57 - white or back white or black and you can
32:58 - see how I'm getting the sort of Contours
33:00 - of the video almost like a silhouette
33:02 - low resolution silhouette with this
33:04 - threshold effect now one thing about it
33:06 - you'll notice if I go back to this
33:08 - example that I hardcoded a threshold
33:10 - value of 127 what would probably be more
33:13 - useful is to have a slider so that you
33:15 - could adjust that threshold you based on
33:17 - you know whatever the sort of existing
33:19 - video is so let's actually do that so
33:21 - one thing I'm going to do is I'm going
33:22 - to make a variable called slider in P5
33:25 - an easy way to place a slider in the
33:27 - browser is with the create slider
33:29 - function of course there's a zillion
33:30 - other ways you can get a slider there
33:32 - but this is just one I'm going to say
33:33 - slider equals create slider and when you
33:36 - make a slider you need three values the
33:38 - minimum value for the slider the maximum
33:40 - value of the slider and where that
33:41 - slider starts so zero is the minimum 255
33:45 - is the maximum and we'll start it right
33:46 - there in the middle at
33:48 - 127 so if I go back and refresh you can
33:51 - see there's a slider down here now that
33:53 - I can move around the issue is I want to
33:56 - take the value of that slider and I want
33:58 - to um I want to assign it to the
34:01 - threshold and that's actually a really
34:02 - easy thing for me to do right now
34:04 - because here I said threshold equals 127
34:07 - all I have to do now to change that is
34:09 - say threshold equals slider. value the
34:11 - value of the slider is the threshold
34:14 - sometimes code it just reads like
34:16 - language in its own sort of way if you
34:18 - read it backwards um so now if I hit
34:21 - refresh you can see here there's the
34:24 - image and I'm trying to look at the
34:25 - camera look at this but as I slide it up
34:28 - you can see that threshold is changing
34:30 - and you can see now with a lower
34:32 - threshold all of the pixels that are
34:34 - rather bright behind me are getting
34:36 - white and actually only my shirt which
34:38 - is kind of dark and my hair which is
34:40 - kind of dark and you can see this is
34:42 - what the actual video is right all those
34:44 - dark pixels are getting assigned um a
34:47 - black uh a black value so I I kind of
34:50 - want to um remember what this value is
34:53 - so I can actually just here in the
34:55 - console type slider. value to see 77 I
34:57 - kind of like this as a threshold value
34:59 - so I'm going to now I'm going to go and
35:01 - change the slider to start at 77 of
35:05 - course I can still adjust it but now
35:07 - each time I hit refresh it'll just start
35:10 - right at 77 okay so now we have this
35:13 - thresholding effect the thing that I
35:16 - want to do is I want to take each of
35:19 - these rectangles that I'm drawing in
35:20 - this canvas and not have it be a canvas
35:23 - with shapes and colors that I'm drawing
35:25 - I want to actually make Dom elements
35:27 - checkbox Dom elements so let's look at
35:30 - how we do that if I go back to the
35:32 - code uh here I'm recording this yes okay
35:35 - just checking if I go back to the code
35:38 - see how I said create slider there's
35:40 - also a P5 function called create
35:42 - checkbox I'm just GNA toss that into
35:45 - setup and you can see look there's a
35:47 - checkbox now there's a checkbox there
35:49 - now what I want to do is I want to make
35:50 - a lot of checkboxes in fact I want a
35:53 - checkbox for every single Pixel in the
35:55 - video so I need a loop to to make
35:57 - checkbox after checkbox after checkbox
35:59 - so I'm going to go back to the code and
36:00 - I'm going to say now what should I Loop
36:02 - through how many checkboxes I do I need
36:05 - well I need one for every X and every y
36:08 - pixel so I need as many checkboxes as
36:10 - the width and the height width times the
36:12 - height of that video Source um I was
36:15 - going to draw a diagram but I think
36:16 - you're with me so um one thing that I
36:18 - think would be useful is actually to
36:20 - just keep track of uh variables for the
36:23 - grid so what we've got here I have this
36:26 - whiteboard I insist on using it so in
36:28 - other words I want a
36:30 - checkbox and there's a certain number of
36:32 - columns right and a certain number of
36:35 - rows and those map to the width and
36:38 - height of the video so what I think
36:41 - would be useful is to have variables
36:43 - called columns and rows so I can just
36:44 - keep track of that number um throughout
36:47 - my code because I'm going need to use it
36:48 - at a bunch of different places so what
36:50 - is um columns the number of columns is
36:54 - the width of the canvas but the canvas
36:57 - is going to go away so I'm going to say
37:00 - 640 it's it's funny how I could I could
37:03 - actually just sort
37:04 - of interestingly enough you know what I
37:08 - just realized these this should be
37:09 - actually a hardcoded value so let's
37:11 - think about what is uh 640 divided by 16
37:15 - you know I could probably do that math
37:16 - in my head but I got a console here 40
37:17 - so let's say we're going to have 40
37:20 - columns and 30 rows that's kind of a
37:22 - reasonable number of
37:23 - checkboxes so uh so my video definitely
37:27 - needs to be the size of
37:30 - columns
37:32 - rows and I don't need to worry about all
37:34 - of that math anymore of scale of canvas
37:37 - because the canvas is going to go away
37:38 - I'm going to leave it there right now
37:39 - because it's useful to have it there as
37:40 - a reference so now what I need to do is
37:43 - I need to say
37:45 - for
37:47 - every
37:51 - column and
37:55 - for every
38:00 - row
38:02 - Create A
38:04 - checkbox and D there we go so now look
38:08 - at this look at all those checkboxes so
38:11 - I now have a checkbox in the browser
38:14 - page for every single Pixel but they're
38:16 - not really organized through by any
38:17 - logic right they're just all next to
38:19 - each other right and so I need them to
38:21 - maintain the same grid right I need to
38:24 - have exactly the number of checkboxes in
38:26 - the first first row the second row the
38:28 - third row so I need to figure out some
38:30 - way of doing that so one way of doing
38:32 - that I knew I had to use for this
38:33 - whiteboard is
38:37 - that let's say I have I have this web
38:40 - page right this is the
38:43 - browser and what's happening when I call
38:45 - create checkbox is it just sticks a
38:47 - checkbox in the page then it sticks
38:49 - another one then sticks another one I'm
38:50 - doing that Millions not millions of
38:52 - times 40 times 30 times you do the math
38:54 - right and it just keeps doing that it
38:55 - gets to the edge of the page it wraps to
38:57 - the next one what I want to actually do
38:58 - I think is establish a div a div being a
39:03 - a container a box an area in the web
39:06 - page maybe I'll call that div mirror and
39:09 - I want to be able to always put the
39:11 - checkboxes in that div that way I could
39:14 - control some style of the div it's width
39:16 - and height its position on the page all
39:17 - of that sort of stuff so I think it
39:19 - would be useful to put a div now I could
39:22 - say creative because P5 has a function
39:25 - creative to put a div in the page but I
39:27 - think this might be a moment where it's
39:28 - actually easier to just dig into the
39:30 - HTML itself so I've gone to the
39:32 - index.html file that's associated with
39:35 - this particular sketch and I'm actually
39:37 - just in the body right here I'm going to
39:39 - add a div and I'm going to say div ID
39:43 - equals zoomed in way too much ID equals
39:49 - mirror so I the ID is very important I
39:52 - need to give that div an ID so I know
39:54 - how to reference it from my JavaScript
39:56 - code for my p5js code so I want to put
39:58 - all the checkboxes into that particular
40:00 - div so let's do that uh whoops um let's
40:04 - go back to sorry I need to go back to
40:06 - the JavaScript code and I need to I'm
40:09 - just going to I need to assign a
40:10 - variable to that checkbox take that Bo
40:13 - that checkbox I made put it in a
40:15 - variable say box. parent mirror and the
40:19 - parent function what it does it say this
40:21 - Dom element you've just made put it
40:23 - inside that div so that div the mirror
40:25 - div becomes the parent to those
40:27 - checkboxes and if I run this now you can
40:30 - see there they are now you're noticing
40:31 - they're above because the canvas and
40:33 - everything else gets created after that
40:35 - particular div now what this allows me
40:37 - to do if I go back to the HTML file is
40:40 - add some styling for that div so pound
40:44 - or hash mirror this is CSS I'll refer
40:48 - you to my CSS tutorial videos but I can
40:51 - do some things like say uh width and I'm
40:53 - going to make it a fixed width of 800
40:55 - pixels I think I kind of worked this out
40:56 - earlier today I think that's going to
40:58 - work about right you know trial and
40:59 - error would probably get me that number
41:01 - and also just so I can see it for a
41:02 - moment I'm going to give it a background
41:04 - color like something kind of light um
41:07 - just so we can see that that div is
41:08 - there I'm going to hit refresh now you
41:11 - can see that that's the container
41:14 - essentially the Box the div and all the
41:16 - check boxes are there and you can see it
41:17 - has a little bit of a background color
41:19 - now notice this didn't really work out I
41:21 - didn't get the exact number of width to
41:24 - like make sure the the um make that sure
41:27 - the checkboxes wrap appropriately but
41:29 - I'm going to I'm going to actually do
41:30 - something to like 100% be right about
41:33 - this so in the
41:36 - sketch I'm looking at every single
41:38 - column and every single row and what I
41:40 - want to do is when I get to the end of a
41:43 - row I want to add a line break an HTML
41:45 - line break so the checkboxes then go
41:47 - onto the next row right I want to do you
41:50 - know 40
41:52 - checkboxes and then put a line bre oh I
41:55 - came over here and I didn't change look
41:56 - I'm over here now sorry uh I want to put
41:59 - 40 uh checkboxes then do a line break
42:02 - and then do the next 40 checkboxes okay
42:06 - so where do I do that in this loop I
42:08 - need to put a line break well
42:09 - incidentally I actually have my Loop
42:11 - this is one of the few times where
42:13 - whether the x is on the outside or the x
42:15 - is on the inside is quite important
42:17 - right because what I need to be doing is
42:19 - I need to be saying uh first do the
42:23 - first row then all the X's then do the
42:25 - second row then all the X's so y needs
42:27 - to be on the outside I have to do all
42:30 - the X's for every y so I've actually got
42:32 - to fix
42:34 - this and put y on the
42:38 - outside and then what I can do is after
42:40 - I do a whole set of x's I can say uh uh
42:45 - line
42:47 - break equals create div I'll just make a
42:50 - div with a line break in it and then
42:54 - also put parent that to what the uh
42:58 - mirror so now I'm guaranteeing that
43:01 - after every row of checkboxes I get a
43:05 - line break so now let's run that oh that
43:09 - doesn't look
43:12 - right uh you know what let's try using
43:14 - Create span I think the div has a lot of
43:17 - uh stuff it's not like in line so let's
43:21 - let's use create span there that's
43:23 - better I knew I missed something so I'm
43:25 - trying to put something in there that
43:26 - doesn't have any padding or line break
43:28 - around it already and a span element
43:30 - allows me to do that you can see 800
43:32 - pixels was about right for this
43:34 - particular area I could have you know
43:35 - maybe it's 750 or whatever but now I can
43:38 - also get rid of that I don't need to uh
43:41 - see the background color anymore that
43:42 - was just sort of for debugging I can
43:45 - take that out and we can see now I have
43:47 - a perfect grid of
43:49 - checkboxes the exact number for every
43:52 - single Pixel in that Source video and
43:54 - you can see here you know I can check
43:56 - them and uncheck them but that's not
43:58 - what I want to happen I want to maybe
44:00 - check the dark ones and uncheck the
44:04 - light ones so how do I do that well
44:06 - first of all I need to have a way of
44:09 - referring to those checkboxes like I
44:11 - made them all and I put them on the page
44:13 - but I didn't store anything so I need an
44:15 - array I need to keep track of all those
44:17 - Dom elements over time how am I doing
44:19 - here uh 13 minutes I was trying to make
44:21 - this under 15
44:23 - minutes it's not going to be okay so
44:26 - make an array called
44:28 - boxes and what I'm going to do is for
44:30 - every checkbox that I make I'm going to
44:32 - put that checkbox in the array so I make
44:35 - an empty array and I'm storing them all
44:37 - so I now have this big array if I
44:40 - refresh the page and I go over here to
44:42 - the console and take a look you can see
44:44 - I have an array with 1,00 checkboxes in
44:47 - it because 40 * 30 is 1,00 1,200 pixels
44:51 - 1,200 checkboxes there's a lot of them
44:53 - they're all P5 elements okay and you can
44:56 - there's all sorts of stuff associated
44:57 - with them so now how do I check or
45:00 - uncheck them so right here where I was
45:04 - saying with my th threshold effect I was
45:06 - previously saying if the brightness is
45:08 - greater than a given threshold fill
45:11 - white otherwise fill black instead what
45:13 - I want to do is I want to say something
45:15 - like check oh
45:17 - boxes index
45:20 - checked
45:23 - false boxes index checked true so what I
45:27 - want to do is I want to uncheck the
45:32 - bright ones check the dark ones and this
45:34 - is a P5 function the checked function is
45:36 - a way of dynamically checking or
45:38 - unchecking a checkbox with code if you
45:40 - don't give it an argument it just gives
45:42 - you returns you whether it's checked or
45:43 - unchecked which is usually what you use
45:45 - a checkbox for okay but this index isn't
45:48 - exactly right remember because the index
45:50 - was this thing where I was trying to
45:52 - look up a pixel and the pixels are like
45:54 - RGB so I need my own own Index this
45:57 - index of looking up the pixels is
45:59 - different than the index in into that
46:01 - array of of checkboxes unfortunately so
46:04 - I'm going to make a new
46:07 - variable I'm going to call that a check
46:10 - index and it is equal
46:14 - to x + y time uh the number of
46:20 - columns and then I'm going to use that
46:23 - checked index so there we go what I'm
46:25 - doing is
46:26 - in I'm doing both actually I'm going to
46:28 - get rid of the rectangle in a second but
46:30 - instead of ultimately instead of drawing
46:32 - rectangles based on pixels I'm checking
46:34 - and unchecking checkboxes and I have an
46:37 - array of pixels that I have to look up
46:38 - the color one way using the X Plus y * 4
46:42 - a whole nonsense and I have to look up
46:44 - in the checkbox array a different way
46:47 - because there are not there's not an RGB
46:49 - and Alpha for each checkbox or just one
46:51 - checkbox I had to say this to myself
46:53 - because it's very confusing okay let's
46:55 - take a to look now hit refresh and we
46:57 - can see here come on video there it is
47:01 - so you can see that right there I am I'm
47:03 - going to high five myself again that's
47:04 - not really working but you can see my
47:06 - face
47:07 - here in checkboxes can zoom in a little
47:10 - bit you can see those checkboxes are
47:12 - going um Up and Down based on my face
47:16 - here I don't know what I'm looking
47:16 - Atmore okay this was exciting it worked
47:18 - sorry I wasn't sure whether that was
47:19 - going to happen so what I want to do now
47:21 - is just get rid of I'm going to say
47:23 - instead of create canvas I'm going to
47:25 - say no canvas
47:27 - and I'm going to get rid of I load
47:29 - pixels which doesn't need to be in there
47:32 - uh and I don't need background anymore
47:34 - there's no canvas I don't need uh these
47:37 - fills anymore I just want to simplify
47:39 - this I don't need this anymore and now
47:41 - if we run this again we should see just
47:45 - the checkbox mirror on the page and you
47:48 - can see here I can play with that
47:49 - threshold still you can see based on
47:51 - what I do with the
47:52 - threshold we get different sort of
47:54 - effects and there it is the Dom checkbox
47:59 - I refreshing it because I like that
48:00 - value of 77 the um Dom checkbox mirror
48:05 - so I don't know so um somebody met in a
48:07 - comment ear said oh wouldn't radio
48:08 - buttons be better maybe you'll get a a
48:10 - better effect you know I would encourage
48:11 - you could you do something weird with
48:13 - like sliders make just regular divs text
48:15 - on the page what kind of um I would love
48:18 - to see people's Frankenstein creations
48:20 - of Dom elements visualizing image data
48:24 - with no canvas and no pixels and no drop
48:26 - just manipulating Dom elements
48:27 - themselves so give that a try tweet me
48:29 - or write in the comments if you make
48:31 - something I would love to see how it
48:32 - turns out thanks for
48:35 - watching okay so that was medium
48:39 - [Music]
48:41 - smooth uh so I'm looking at the comments
48:45 - says um somebody said cool man how was
48:48 - that was that okay to that makes sense I
48:50 - kind of feel like I lost myself in a few
48:52 - uh tangents there I'm going to check
48:54 - twitch type tighten up the checkbox grid
48:56 - maybe
48:57 - somebody
49:00 - uh yeah I think somebody on Twitch is
49:03 - very confused probably because they just
49:05 - uh so um San Diego classic says uh I'm
49:10 - confused or if you're confused imagine
49:11 - probably goes so if you are if you just
49:14 - accidentally came here I would and you
49:16 - um and you're confused I might go back
49:18 - and watch some of my earlier tutorials
49:19 - that kind of like led up to this I don't
49:21 - know how else okay uh spectron writes
49:24 - would it be possible to have a dynamic
49:26 - threshold calculating the average of the
49:28 - brightness value of every pixel and set
49:30 - this average as the threshold or
49:32 - something absolutely that's a great
49:34 - that's a great suggestion so you could
49:36 - you could have a threshold value that
49:38 - adjusts based on what the camera is
49:39 - actually seeing so if in a bright room
49:41 - it has a sort of higher threshold in a
49:43 - dark room it has a lower threshold and
49:45 - there might be some other sort of magic
49:47 - learning types of algorithms you could
49:48 - think about applying so certainly that I
49:50 - mean that's something you could
49:51 - absolutely
49:52 - do
49:54 - um all right so that recorded let's look
49:57 - it's 1:35 I was going to try to do this
50:00 - until like 2 I wouldn't or a little bit
50:05 - after I've been streaming now for uh 50
50:10 - minutes I don't know how much I have a
50:12 - sore throat today uh where is my uh list
50:15 - of
50:16 - things videos to
50:19 - do oh yeah we should definitely do the
50:21 - next
50:23 - one this one is one of my favorite ones
50:27 - okay so I'm GNA um so if you guys have
50:29 - more questions type them into the chat
50:31 - I'm going to start opening up some
50:32 - examples and getting myself situated to
50:34 - make another tutorial which is about
50:36 - kind of doing a painting So what I want
50:38 - to do is I'm going to
50:40 - show uh let me see if I can find
50:43 - this
50:48 - uh uh this
50:51 - is see if this will
50:53 - open so what I'm doing now is I'm
50:55 - opening a project that I actually made
50:57 - not in processing but I made this
50:59 - project in
51:00 - 2002 and it is
51:05 - a
51:07 - um I'm going to see if this runs um so
51:10 - what this project does is it has all of
51:13 - these flocking agents and what they do
51:17 - is they
51:19 - um color
51:22 - in
51:23 - uh sorry I'm looking at to see how this
51:26 - looks they smear colors that they're
51:28 - picking up from a camera so what I want
51:31 - to do is basically like show how you
51:33 - make something like this but I want to
51:36 - um there's a couple things I want to do
51:38 - with this so I think what I want to do
51:42 - is
51:45 - uh just add a few things where where am
51:47 - I am I in draw here yes uh so like if
51:51 - Mouse pressed background uh zero
51:56 - oops oh yeah that's fine uh let's just
51:59 - uh put this on the
52:02 - desktop uh
52:04 - oops ah desktop
52:09 - desktop so I want to uh I think what I
52:12 - would like to be able to show
52:15 - is this so that's really what's going on
52:19 - there are all of these uh agents moving
52:23 - around uh and then when I Let Go
52:26 - there's the background is not cleared
52:27 - okay so that's I think that's a and then
52:30 - I wonder if it's
52:31 - worth um just
52:35 - putting video in the top left corner so
52:37 - you can kind of see it
52:41 - actually I'm just going to do that in
52:43 - the in the
52:50 - debugging so let me do
52:53 - this where's the mouse come out oh right
52:57 - so you can see that's what it's actually
52:58 - doing and then it's doing it as a mirror
53:01 - though okay so I'm going to show this as
53:04 - an example and then what I'm going to do
53:07 - is make a project that does this ah I
53:10 - know what to do and I'm going to base it
53:12 - off of the example I have from a
53:14 - previous video with all those things
53:15 - that move around randomly storing their
53:17 - history okay
53:20 - uh so what I need to do very quickly is
53:25 - not very quickly actually I just need to
53:26 - do this is do uh I'm going to call this
53:30 - 06
53:32 - painting and um I'm going to go to
53:38 - Sublime and I'm going
53:41 - to
53:44 - uh
53:47 - um oh I kind of want this checkbox
53:51 - mirror would be a better oh this
53:53 - brightness mirror would be a better one
53:54 - to start with with oops just sneeze it's
53:58 - going to be
54:00 - loud
54:02 - okay okay uh just checking the chat
54:07 - there might be some questions in the
54:08 - chat I'll get to them in a second let me
54:10 - get what I'm doing
54:11 - here
54:16 - uh so I have a basic example
54:21 - now uh which if I go here
54:25 - should just have this and the
54:27 - video and now what I
54:30 - want is I want to get so a a while back
54:33 - I made a
54:35 - video let's see if we can find this um
54:39 - it was
54:40 - called uh let me go under
54:43 - playlists it's under p5g tutorial
54:46 - additional topics drawing object Trails
54:50 - so uh now I'm I'm watching it this is an
54:53 - ad inside an ad so uh P5 just part uh
54:57 - 9.4 so I should be able to go to um
55:01 - GitHub
55:03 - shiftman video Lesson materials and go
55:07 - to code p5js
55:10 - 9.4 and I should be able to grab the
55:12 - code for this particular kind of
55:14 - particle I'm going to grab
55:16 - it and I'm going to create a new
55:20 - file and I'm going to call it uh
55:22 - particle.
55:24 - Js and to paste it in here now the
55:26 - interesting thing here is I realized I
55:29 - don't actually need the history even
55:33 - though that's what that whole example
55:34 - was
55:36 - about
55:38 - um because I'm just not going to draw
55:41 - the background so I'm going to just do
55:46 - this so I just need the particle which
55:49 - is just a randomly moving thing
55:51 - obviously you could be more thoughtful
55:53 - about how you have things move
55:56 - uh and then I'm going to I don't need
55:59 - that anymore so let me just make sure
56:01 - this works I'm going to say VAR
56:05 - particle particle equals new
56:10 - particle particle. update particle dot
56:14 - what did I call it maybe I called it
56:18 - show uh particle is not defined right
56:21 - because I need
56:22 - to reference it in in the HTML
56:27 - file I don't need this styling I don't
56:30 - need this
56:32 - div
56:34 - and seems to be working so let's take a
56:38 - look particle it needs an X and A Y and
56:43 - it also uh let's make it white it needs
56:46 - an X and A Y so let's put it in the
56:51 - middle great so we have a particle
56:55 - moving we have a video so I want the
56:57 - particle to pick up the colors from the
56:59 - video then I want to have a lot of them
57:01 - then I want them to
57:03 - smear um so let's just let me just take
57:07 - a do a few more things just to sort of
57:09 - see how this is going to work I'm not
57:10 - going to go through all this I'll start
57:11 - recording in a second background
57:14 - 51 okay so you can see how that works
57:17 - but probably one thing I should change
57:20 - is have no
57:23 - stroke
57:26 - and you can see so this is now in
57:29 - essence smearing colors uh and those
57:32 - colors could be picked up from the live
57:34 - video okay let me check the chat this
57:36 - I'm pretty much ready I think to go with
57:39 - these examples to set the stage okay
57:45 - um so I'm I'm looking at the anyone have
57:49 - any suggestions for playing with midi
57:51 - with P5 that's a good question I don't
57:53 - so I'm move on to the next question
57:55 - although I will say the P5 Sound Library
57:56 - has a ton of features you might check
57:58 - that out to see if there's something in
57:59 - there that you could use um what's your
58:01 - view on VAR creation should vars only be
58:04 - created outside a loop does it matter
58:06 - with
58:07 - JS my view honestly is an um you know
58:11 - I'm probably going someone's going to
58:13 - like the the variable police are going
58:16 - to like charge in here the and like take
58:20 - me out in variable handcuffs but you
58:21 - know I kind of feel like whatever works
58:23 - it's fine don't worry about it too much
58:24 - I you know it's kind of I think there
58:26 - are larger questions of kind of
58:28 - efficiency and optimization when you get
58:30 - to a certain point in a project but I
58:32 - think while you're being creative and
58:34 - trying to figure out an idea or make
58:35 - something work however it kind of like
58:36 - makes sense to you to organize stuff is
58:38 - just fine I do think on some level
58:40 - though um having variables scoped to
58:43 - only where you need them can help you
58:45 - from an organizational standpoint so
58:47 - there's not really aot good reason to
58:48 - have a thousand Global variables if
58:51 - certain variables are just sort of local
58:52 - to inside a particular Loop somewhere I
58:54 - would declare them in there but there's
58:55 - a lot of particular JavaScript stuff
58:57 - with that that's that would be a
58:58 - perspective I would say um what if you
59:01 - wanted to manipulate heading size
59:03 - correlating to the amount of similarly
59:05 - grouped pixel
59:06 - colors um I I I lost track of where this
59:10 - is
59:12 - um what this is referring to but maybe
59:14 - if you're talking about the flocking you
59:16 - could would be interesting to think
59:17 - about having those agents that are
59:19 - painting colors actually move towards
59:21 - certain kinds of colors have forces that
59:23 - drive them I think that's a very
59:24 - interesting idea
59:27 - um
59:28 - okay um uh oh brackets someone mentions
59:32 - brackets which is also a great um editor
59:34 - environment that you could potentially
59:36 - use um I should probably do um I should
59:40 - probably do some more tutorials with um
59:43 - other editors like Adam or brackets ah
59:45 - let me mention something to you guys
59:46 - really important if you're trying to
59:48 - play with my examples there is a bug in
59:51 - P5 let's go check on the current status
59:53 - it is bug I have this one memorized uh
59:57 - uh it is it under issues
60:00 - 1079 so there's an issue where when I'll
60:03 - show you exactly in the example what the
60:05 - problem
60:06 - is when you call video. size and scale
60:10 - it down the pixel array doesn't actually
60:13 - scale down as well which you Mo almost
60:16 - always want because you're making the
60:18 - video lower resolution so you can look
60:19 - at fewer pixels so I have made a
60:22 - modified version of P5 Dom .js which you
60:25 - can get if you go to the video Lesson
60:27 - materials GitHub
60:28 - repository um that fixes that bug and
60:32 - that bug has not let's see if there's
60:34 - any additional discussion um that bug
60:36 - has not yet been resolved so I'm making
60:39 - these videos the tutorials that will
60:41 - live on YouTube without really
60:42 - referencing that bug because I at some
60:44 - point in the future people will just be
60:46 - like watching the video tutorial and
60:47 - p5js will do that thing but if I just
60:49 - want to mention that because if you're
60:50 - following along and playing with the
60:52 - examples what you're going to want to
60:53 - get and I'll just be a little bit more
60:55 - clear about this is if you go to/
60:58 - shiftman video Lesson materials code P5
61:02 - jet
61:03 - JJs and oop sorry the ones that are 10
61:06 - point whatever I haven't uploaded the
61:08 - ones from today yet but if you get the
61:10 - one that's like 10.4 p5js brightness
61:12 - mirror it's going to have the P5 Li the
61:15 - modified P5 Library files that I'm using
61:17 - that have that bug fixed in them and
61:19 - then at some point the actual new
61:21 - release of p5js will have the bug fixed
61:23 - in them but for now and I'm so anyway if
61:25 - that's unclear please ask in the
61:28 - chat um so uh people are suggesting you
61:32 - do a tutorial with brackets and with
61:34 - atom so let me make let me add that um
61:37 - to my uh list of
61:39 - things so I'm going to
61:43 - um so I'm going to make a item which is
61:46 - like different editors with p5js I'm
61:50 - going to add uh
61:53 - brackets
61:57 - Adam
61:59 - Etc so there we go uh where am I here
62:04 - little lost why did I oh update okay so
62:08 - uh that's just a note that I'll remember
62:10 - later to do that okay let's see where am
62:12 - I now here we are painting that's
62:16 - here um the video is
62:21 - loading the pixels are loading the
62:25 - particle is updated and showing why oh
62:27 - I'm way too far over that's the problem
62:29 - I'm supposed to have my laptop here so I
62:31 - stand here and don't block the code was
62:33 - I blocking the code in that entire
62:34 - previous video oh God I hope that wasn't
62:36 - too
62:37 - bad
62:39 - uh such as life okay um so let me call
62:44 - this one
62:46 - 06
62:48 - painting
62:52 - and uh I'm going to to close all these
62:56 - so all I need is sketch and particle
62:58 - particle and
63:00 - sketch
63:02 - and that's running here um can close
63:06 - this I should probably follow this all
63:09 - the way through and make it but whatever
63:11 - I'm going to improvise
63:13 - it and I'm going to get processing
63:16 - open uh make this small so I really need
63:19 - it this is just for demonstration
63:22 - purposes and I wonder if the browser is
63:25 - using the camera can processing use it
63:27 - as well we're about to find out
63:30 - amazingly yes although it is running a
63:32 - little bit
63:33 - slower so I think what I'm going to do
63:36 - is get back here have the code open
63:40 - processing open I am also going
63:43 - to uh erase this
63:47 - whiteboard does this seem kind of dark
63:50 - to you guys by the way um this view of
63:53 - the Whiteboard let me know how the image
63:55 - quality is if it's blurry or dark um
63:58 - it's definitely better than it was uh
64:00 - last time I did this and I could
64:02 - brighten it for sure I know a way of
64:04 - bright but I'm I'm I'm kind of not going
64:05 - to do that right now I might move the
64:07 - light closer to me or whatever anyway
64:09 - just let me know if it seems
64:10 - dark uh okay
64:13 - um okay so we're at an hour I've got 26
64:17 - people I'm going to just check the
64:18 - twitch chat
64:20 - [Music]
64:22 - um uh thank you San Diego classic nice
64:26 - comment saying that there you like the
64:27 - setup I've been working very hard on
64:29 - this setup so it pleases me uh
64:32 - greatly okay so here we are I going to
64:35 - do the next video painting a portrait
64:39 - with things moving and pixels and yada
64:41 - Yad yada yada yada
64:45 - okay I'm going to cycle the
64:53 - cameras
64:59 - and actually you know what I'm going to
65:01 - do I'm going to start this
65:04 - video with this just running behind me
65:07 - and maybe I will even let it run for a
65:11 - little
65:13 - bit uh now the question is oh
65:16 - interesting
65:17 - so also I think what I should do is
65:19 - angle
65:22 - this sorry I'm just trying to get
65:26 - this doing
65:30 - something how look how orange I
65:32 - am okay so that's pretty good for right
65:36 - now okay so what does this look like oh
65:38 - yeah it kind of works I'm looking at the
65:42 - chat could be a bit brighter okay I'm
65:45 - gonna look into making the um whiteboard
65:48 - view a little bit brighter so I can see
65:50 - I'm so much brighter over here and it
65:52 - probably is like a setting on the camera
65:54 - actually there's like what are those
65:55 - things called f-stop something frustrum
65:59 - fro frogel from I don't know any it's
66:03 - I'm it's pathetic how I supposedly know
66:05 - something about technology I'm like
66:07 - completely inept if it's not like
66:09 - software it's like the camera is like a
66:11 - physical thing that I cannot touch or
66:13 - else I might break it or hurt myself
66:16 - okay um here we go I have to reach over
66:20 - to hit
66:22 - record uh okay
66:26 - look at that yeah there's I don't know
66:28 - okay I'm going to do this here we go I'm
66:30 - like rolling up my sleeves it's getting
66:31 - is getting warm in here I think but it's
66:34 - okay it's not so bad summertime might be
66:36 - a problem all right let's
66:39 - go hello in this video I'm going to look
66:42 - at how to create a certain kind of
66:44 - effect the effect that you see behind me
66:46 - where you have things that are drawing
66:48 - in a window um let me start this video
66:53 - over
66:57 - uh okay so uh by the way spiky cat who
66:59 - just joined asked what language is this
67:01 - this particular example that I'm running
67:03 - is actually running in processing just
67:05 - because it is a project that I
67:07 - made uh 14 years ago and I recently
67:11 - ported it to processing but I'm going to
67:13 - demonstrate how to code something like
67:15 - this in p5js but I I will Port all of
67:19 - these except for the checkbox one I
67:20 - can't Port anything anything that I can
67:22 - port to processing I will port to
67:24 - processing
67:25 - okay here we go
67:32 - everybody hello I am here to make a
67:35 - video to show you how to program a
67:37 - certain kind of thing a kind of thing
67:39 - like the thing you see behind me which
67:41 - is oh I have to stand still for this to
67:42 - happen but um what you see behind me is
67:45 - a flocking system there are all of these
67:48 - little squares floating around the
67:50 - screen and what they're doing is they're
67:51 - picking up pixel values color values
67:53 - from a CA camera that's in front of me
67:54 - and smearing those colors onto the
67:56 - screen so this is a project that I
67:58 - actually I think that I made around 14
68:00 - years ago I'm running updated version of
68:02 - it that runs in processing and what I'm
68:04 - going to do is show you how to actually
68:05 - make something like this happen in the
68:07 - browser using JavaScript p5js HTML 5
68:11 - canvas um so let me just mention a few
68:13 - other things about this that you'll see
68:15 - is that so if I if I click the mouse
68:16 - here which um I'm now I'm clearing the
68:19 - background and what you'll see is
68:20 - they're just all of these squares moving
68:22 - around the screen now they're using this
68:24 - kind of like bees swarming insect
68:25 - swarming sort of kind of like motion and
68:27 - you can see that's what the camera is
68:28 - actually seeing up behind me and so if I
68:31 - let go of the mouse instead of clearing
68:33 - the background these agents will just
68:35 - simply uh you know keep drawing those
68:38 - colors but their their trails are being
68:40 - revealed so how does how do you program
68:42 - something like this let's so I'm going
68:44 - to close this down um and I'm going to
68:48 - minimize processing here and I've got a
68:50 - p5js example that I'm going to start
68:52 - with and the example just has a a couple
68:54 - things it has a live video and it has a
68:57 - single particle now this particle comes
69:00 - from a previous video that I will
69:02 - magically have an annotation pop up that
69:04 - references where I showed you how to
69:06 - have something move around the screen
69:07 - and draw a trail of itself and you can
69:09 - see here and it's going to move randomly
69:11 - so the you know in the swarming thing
69:14 - they're swarming like insects here it's
69:15 - just going to move randomly but if you
69:17 - decide to take this example and do
69:18 - something with it you might think of
69:20 - different kinds of motion spiral Etc
69:22 - whatever that you might think of doing
69:23 - so let me on this particular
69:25 - example right here and you can see this
69:28 - is all it is you can see that there is a
69:30 - video Dom element giving me a sort of
69:32 - low resolution image of myself that I
69:34 - can use to pick up pixel colors and
69:36 - there is a thing moving around the
69:37 - screen randomly a single particle so the
69:40 - first thing that I want to figure out
69:42 - how to do is how do I have this particle
69:45 - actually grab colors from that video and
69:48 - um so notice that I say video. load
69:51 - pixels um one thing that I'm going to do
69:53 - just WR now for a second is put
69:54 - background back into
69:57 - draw and I'm going to run this again so
70:00 - you can see this is what's happening so
70:01 - what I want is for that particle to be
70:03 - colored according to what's in the video
70:05 - so this is actually kind of an easy
70:07 - thing to do surprisingly
70:10 - enough in the particle object itself
70:13 - notice how it gets a fill color which is
70:15 - always 255 comma 150 so it's white with
70:18 - a little bit of alpha but I don't want
70:20 - this to be 255 rather what I want is to
70:23 - get some sort of color from the video.
70:27 - getet this.x this.y so this is kind of
70:30 - the idea here what I want is I have the
70:37 - canvas with a particle moving around and
70:41 - I have this particular video with a
70:44 - portrait you know of myself so this
70:48 - particle should look up the
70:50 - corresponding color in the video and set
70:53 - its f fill and this particle's location
70:56 - is at
70:57 - this.x this doy so I should be able to
71:00 - just say give me the pixel value at
71:02 - this.x this.y in the video only I can't
71:05 - right because if you notice this canvas
71:08 - is actually 640 by 480 and my video is
71:12 - actually 40 by 30 so what I need to do
71:16 - is I need to scale down so wherever the
71:18 - particle is it's X and Y I need to scale
71:21 - it down dividing by 16 to find the
71:24 - corresponding pixel value in the video
71:26 - so let's come back over here and do that
71:28 - so what I think could be useful is to
71:30 - make another variable I'm going to call
71:31 - it PX for like pixel X I just made a
71:35 - weird like arm motion that I don't know
71:36 - what it means pixel X um PX and I'm
71:39 - going to say this.x divided by V scale
71:42 - if you remember V scale is a variable
71:44 - that I have that keeps track of how big
71:46 - is the canvas relative to the video and
71:48 - I'm going to make another variable
71:49 - called py which is this.y divided by V
71:53 - scale and I'm going to say now give me
71:56 - the color at PX py now there's a slight
71:58 - issue P I wonder if P5 actually doesn't
72:01 - care let's keep going there's an issue
72:03 - which is that I might get the number
72:05 - 4.79
72:06 - 83125 which is not a valid pixel value
72:09 - pixel values are only whole numbers
72:11 - integer values pixel 4 pixel 7 there's
72:13 - no pixel 7 and a half so I might need to
72:16 - add something to this to correct that
72:17 - but let's just sort of see at least what
72:19 - happens now what is in this variable Co
72:24 - let's just see if this even works and
72:27 - I'm going to because I'm going to add
72:28 - console.log the color and I'm by the way
72:30 - I'm not using the word color even though
72:33 - I have a variable that's describing a
72:36 - color color the word color is a keyword
72:38 - in P5 it's an actual function so I'm
72:40 - just saying Co for kind of short for
72:42 - color so let's now go back and run this
72:45 - again we have a view of our console here
72:48 - we can see I'm only ever getting black
72:50 - that doesn't seem right I I don't think
72:53 - it should be black uh 00 255 so let's go
72:57 - and let's add this thing that I want to
72:59 - add which maybe we'll fix it saying
73:01 - floor so what floor does is it takes any
73:04 - number that might be a decimal number
73:06 - and lops off that decimal number so 3.8
73:09 - becomes three 3.3 becomes 3 3.9 becomes
73:12 - 3 7.2 becomes seven just takes that and
73:15 - gives me a nice integer whole number
73:16 - which is what I need and let's run this
73:18 - again still getting only black here oh
73:21 - no there we go just took a minute for
73:22 - the video to like come alive so you can
73:25 - see this is working and that it's
73:27 - pulling out color values you can see
73:28 - they're all very green because it's
73:29 - probably wandering around the green
73:31 - screen behind me so what can I do now I
73:34 - should be able to say and notice by the
73:35 - way that this is an array so the get
73:38 - function gives you a single Pixel and it
73:40 - gives you an array a red green blue and
73:43 - Alpha value so what I can do is I can
73:47 - say now fill now fill the red Val
73:51 - there's a bunch of different ways I
73:52 - could do this but and this might be sort
73:53 - of a silly way but I'm just going to say
73:55 - let me actually now take the red green
73:57 - and blue values to color that particular
74:00 - and I can take out console.log I can run
74:03 - this again and you can see come alive
74:05 - video you can see look it's green and
74:07 - you can see if my face gets in there
74:09 - there we go it's picking up colors so
74:11 - good we're getting somewhere now let's
74:13 - go back to sketch. JS let's put let's
74:16 - take out background and draw and put
74:19 - background back in setup and you can see
74:22 - now it is going to
74:23 - start painting me if I stood very still
74:26 - but rather slowly and who knows how long
74:29 - and how patient we can be here to kind
74:31 - of do this so what what would might make
74:34 - this better is to have a lot of these in
74:36 - the window so what I think would make
74:39 - more sense is for me to make an array
74:41 - called
74:43 - particles let's start with 100 of
74:49 - them and let's say particles index I
74:53 - equals a new particle so instead of
74:55 - having a single variable particle let's
74:56 - have an array of particles let's make a
74:58 - whole bunch of them and then
75:03 - everything I can do a loop here through
75:05 - all the
75:10 - particles and just say particles index I
75:14 - update particles index I
75:17 - show and now I can run this again and we
75:20 - can
75:21 - see there we go as I move around you can
75:24 - see I'm kind of getting this like very
75:26 - pointal list like portrait of myself now
75:28 - there is no swarming there is no
75:30 - flocking it's just random motion also
75:32 - these particles they're leaving the
75:34 - window they're gone forever let's see if
75:36 - we can just make a few improvements to
75:38 - this at least to keep it a bit more
75:40 - stable so one thing that I think is kind
75:42 - of important here um and might be worth
75:45 - it might be worth actually making like a
75:46 - little slider for this I'm going to add
75:48 - a
75:49 - slider uh is that that Alpha value is
75:51 - going to make a big difference in in uh
75:54 - what it looks like so Alpha goes between
75:55 - 0 and 255 let's start in the middle at
75:59 - 127 and so I'm going to make a slider
76:01 - and then I'm just going to take this
76:03 - Alpha value Alpha value and have it be
76:05 - the value of that slider so we can sort
76:07 - of see what happens here with like less
76:10 - Alpha you know no Alpha like uh less
76:14 - more Alpha I don't what is it you could
76:17 - get that so it's fuzzier or harsher so
76:19 - that's one thing that's sort of
76:20 - important to see the other thing that I
76:22 - think might be good to do is add some
76:25 - kind of constraints like uh this.x
76:28 - equals constrain it's valued between
76:31 - zero and
76:32 - width I could probably come up with a
76:34 - better solution
76:36 - this.y zero. height so I don't ever want
76:39 - it to leave the window um so I want to
76:43 - keep it always
76:45 - on in the window and so we can see now
76:49 - uh and they're all starting from the
76:51 - middle maybe I should maybe maybe I want
76:53 - to have them all start from uh you know
76:56 - a random spot in the
76:59 - window
77:01 - just uh so let's do that so you can see
77:05 - here and uh now that's working let's see
77:09 - what happens if now
77:11 - I go and uh make 500 of them is this
77:15 - even going to
77:16 - run come video so you can see there's an
77:19 - issue here which is like performance is
77:22 - a bit of an issue even even though I
77:23 - have so many more now that I'm kind of
77:26 - more quickly seeing the image resolve
77:28 - whether or not I want that I don't know
77:29 - but it's running rather slow so there is
77:31 - a limit to how much we can really draw
77:33 - on canvas let's try 200 and see if it's
77:35 - kind of a smoother
77:37 - animation there we go so 200 seems
77:39 - pretty good another thing that I might
77:41 - add to this I'm stop and is uh maybe a
77:44 - variable for a size so I'm drawing them
77:48 - all as a 24x 24 but maybe I should make
77:51 - a random size between like four and
77:54 - 32 and uh so each one of these particles
77:58 - will actually be a different size um
78:01 - which it might be kind of an interesting
78:02 - effect to have sort of like smaller dots
78:04 - and larger dots I don't know if that's
78:06 - really helpful I'm going to try to stand
78:08 - still for a second um you get the idea I
78:10 - could keep going with this so what I
78:11 - would say there's a you know there's
78:13 - there's a few things that I want to
78:14 - mention here number one is um there's a
78:17 - couple things that I'm doing in the in
78:19 - the original example that I showed you
78:20 - that maybe I won't add right now but
78:21 - I'll mention
78:23 - one thing that you might that that can
78:25 - be an issue is that if you have
78:27 - depending on what your motion
78:30 - is if you have a particle that's here
78:33 - and then the next frame it's over here
78:35 - there's going to be this sort of jump so
78:37 - one thing that I did do in that you
78:39 - could consider doing is wherever the
78:40 - particle moves to also draw particles in
78:43 - between them so you always get this
78:45 - continuous line you could also use
78:47 - actually just the line function and keep
78:49 - track of its previous location and its
78:50 - current location that's one thing that
78:52 - you might consider consider the other
78:54 - thing that you might consider is
78:56 - averaging color over time so let me let
78:59 - me let me explain what I mean by this so
79:02 - let's say there is uh this is the figure
79:05 - that the camera is seeing and this is
79:07 - the particle and it's moving this way
79:09 - and this is the painting that it's
79:11 - making so and this is a red sweater and
79:14 - this is a black background what you're
79:16 - going to see based on what I've done
79:18 - here is red red red red red black right
79:24 - this being that edge the particle is
79:26 - going to instantly change to the next
79:28 - color cuz it's literally drawing the
79:30 - color it sees with the pixel but if
79:32 - every time it moves you just average in
79:35 - a little more color then that creates a
79:38 - smearing effect so what you would see
79:40 - instead is red red red red red a little
79:43 - less red a little less a little less red
79:45 - blacker blacker blacker blacker blacker
79:46 - blacker black black black red a little
79:48 - more red so it's going to average the
79:51 - color as it's moving so in in order to
79:53 - do that what you would need is for your
79:57 - particle object to actually store a
79:59 - color and when you get the color from
80:00 - the video to average that new color with
80:02 - the color that it's storing so I'll
80:04 - leave that as an exercise and I'll try
80:06 - to post an example that does that
80:07 - there's actually a P5 function called
80:09 - lurp color that will do this math of
80:12 - averaging for you that you could look at
80:13 - using uh boy I really kind want to add
80:15 - it right now but I'm not going to um but
80:18 - and then the other thing I would say is
80:20 - to really think about is what is the
80:22 - motion so so you know if I go back
80:24 - really quickly just remind ourselves
80:26 - what this looks like with the background
80:27 - on right you can see this is this is the
80:31 - motion of my particles that are painting
80:33 - the image but what if all the particles
80:35 - just move left and right or up and down
80:37 - or they use a flocking system or they're
80:38 - all bouncing off of each other or
80:40 - they're all spiraling around so what are
80:42 - some other ways that you can think of
80:44 - how those brush Strokes are created and
80:46 - in addition like are you just drawing
80:48 - circles are you smearing like you know
80:50 - image textures or rectangles there's a
80:52 - lot of possibil ities here so think
80:53 - about all those possibilities maybe make
80:55 - some sort of painting thing pixel
80:58 - whatever and share it with me on Twitter
81:00 - or in the comments and uh ask your
81:02 - questions and I look forward to see what
81:04 - people make under 1550 minutes thank
81:07 - goodness okay uh see you
81:09 - soon okay
81:11 - I there's something to be said for
81:13 - practicing these videos before you do
81:14 - them okay um boy there's a dis a whole
81:18 - discussion here in the
81:21 - um in the chat
81:24 - uh people are talking about neural
81:26 - networks
81:32 - uh yes uh you know um nion cat fan you
81:36 - know this is I'm glad you brought this
81:38 - up um I don't maybe this isn't what you
81:41 - U meant to discuss or what you were
81:43 - actually talking about but in the nature
81:44 - of code book I do have a chapter on
81:47 - neural
81:49 - networks it's all the way down here uh
81:52 - chapter 10 and I would say it's this
81:54 - chapter is a little bit of a copout uh
81:56 - it's I kind of it's kind of like a
81:58 - little bit tacked on like the whole all
82:00 - this material flows together one from
82:02 - the other tells this story and then
82:03 - there's this kind of like tacton neural
82:05 - network things it's kind of like ah this
82:06 - is sort of what it is and here's some
82:08 - examples and then here's visualizing
82:09 - drawing the diagram but no actual
82:12 - applications so I'm actually working on
82:13 - a revised version of this chapter um uh
82:18 - based on new things that have come alive
82:20 - in the world of machine learning for
82:23 - artists there's a great Caden course uh
82:26 - by Rebecca Rebecca febr if I pronounce
82:29 - her name correctly from Goldsmith it's
82:30 - an online course from a company called
82:32 - kadenz about machine learning for
82:34 - artists Jean kogan is somebody that you
82:36 - could look up who's creating a tons of
82:39 - tutorials and information about machine
82:40 - learning has showed me he showed me the
82:42 - other day some different JavaScript
82:43 - libraries for using neural networks so
82:45 - you know I don't I I don't um so I'm
82:47 - going to try to make that chapter it's
82:49 - not going to be a comprehensive suddenly
82:50 - like machine learning book but have a
82:52 - bit more depth to it and perhaps one or
82:54 - two actual practical examples that you
82:56 - could apply to the some of the motion
82:58 - based stuff that's in the book so we'll
82:59 - see if that's kind of on my list of
83:00 - things to do now this springsummer
83:05 - um okay let's see
83:08 - here
83:11 - um uh some people are saying hi James
83:14 - Johnson says you're late sorry I'm just
83:17 - about finishing up for right now today
83:19 - it is oh yeah it's after two so I
83:21 - unfortunately to go um I let's look at
83:25 - my list
83:26 - here um videos to do all right so I
83:30 - didn't get to the slit scan or
83:32 - seriously. JS I'm going to see if I can
83:34 - come back later I by the way so every
83:37 - time I've said this I haven't come back
83:38 - but I but I'm going to see if I can come
83:41 - back in an hour and a half or so two
83:44 - hours and do one or two more videos this
83:47 - going to be tight today to do that
83:49 - however I will be doing more videos on
83:51 - Thursday and Friday of this week so I'm
83:53 - definitely going to get to these last
83:54 - two topics on Thursday and or Friday and
83:57 - then I'm hoping now that I have a sort
84:00 - of better lighting setup in here um to
84:03 - be able to uh start I think what I want
84:07 - to do
84:09 - is uh this
84:11 - week sorry let me go back my plan is to
84:15 - do the um get tutorials get those going
84:20 - and then also um because I'm a workshop
84:23 - next weekend on twitterbots I want to um
84:28 - I'm probably going to be making some
84:29 - more examples with node and P5 and so I
84:31 - might um try to do these sort of like
84:34 - node uh tutorials um next week as videos
84:37 - as well so we'll see if I get to that um
84:40 - let me just see if anybody has any last
84:43 - questions um I have not seen Mario but
84:48 - I'm going to look that up oh and
84:49 - somebody asked what's the difference
84:50 - between lurp and lurp color great
84:53 - question so lurp stands for linear
84:56 - interpolation it's a way of linearly
84:59 - moving between two values and the
85:01 - regular lurp function just says like if
85:03 - I have the value zero and the value 10
85:05 - and I want to lurp 60% I'm getting the
85:08 - value six so it's just luring a single
85:11 - value what lurp color does is because
85:13 - color is not a single value but a
85:15 - collection of red green and blue values
85:17 - is it the lurp color function allows you
85:19 - to say take these rgbs and this target
85:22 - rgbs and lurp all three of those all in
85:24 - one so lurp color is exactly the same as
85:26 - lurp but it's doing it with multiple
85:28 - values for a color hopefully that made
85:30 - sense
85:31 - [Music]
85:34 - um uh yes yes those are the great
85:37 - feedback about the neural network
85:39 - chapter nen cat fan thanks for that okay
85:43 - um thanks for the nice comments thanks
85:46 - arger ah Mr breitz gamer says I'm French
85:50 - do you speak French well I'm a I'm
85:53 - unfortunately an American and in this
85:54 - country no one ever bothers to like do a
85:57 - really good job of making us learn lots
85:59 - of other languages which we really
86:00 - should to be a citizen of the world but
86:02 - I did happen to learn French when I was
86:04 - in middle and high school so I do
86:07 - speak um but that's about other
86:11 - languages not very much um but I would
86:13 - love to learn more languages and speak
86:15 - more languages I would really like to
86:16 - have all these videos translated and
86:18 - subtitled but I right now it's sort of
86:21 - right now would just like them to be
86:23 - closed caption for people who are
86:24 - hearing impaired
86:26 - um uh and so that's sort of my number
86:29 - one priority right now and then I would
86:30 - also like to have them translated so if
86:31 - anybody has any ideas about how to do
86:33 - that I'm looking into crowdsourcing or
86:35 - paying services and different ways of
86:37 - doing that I will be getting to that uh
86:40 - okay uh make a bot to do that I don't
86:43 - know if that's what you're uh I don't
86:46 - know if that's what you make uh make
86:48 - what you're referring to anyway
86:50 - um okay uh I uh is it essential to write
86:54 - this variable in the class I'm not sure
86:57 - okay I got to go so I'll be back send me
87:00 - your questions on Twitter or in the
87:02 - YouTube comments uh you can always post
87:04 - questions to the processing forum and
87:06 - then send me a link to your Forum post
87:09 - that's much preferable to email
87:10 - questions it's too much I can't I email
87:12 - questions I'll I have a trouble getting
87:14 - to them it's not my that I desire to get
87:16 - to them but it's sort of hard to
87:17 - maintain so if you have questions
87:19 - YouTube comments Twitter sort of not the
87:21 - greatest place to post a question but
87:22 - it's a good place to get in touch but
87:24 - posting a complex question in a
87:26 - processing forum and you know tweeting
87:27 - me a link to that that's a good way okay
87:29 - uh back maybe today if I have time to
87:33 - slip one more in otherwise Thursday or
87:35 - Friday definitely not tomorrow though
87:37 - tomorrow I have other things on my
87:39 - schedule so I won't be here in the
87:40 - recording studio see
87:43 - yall
