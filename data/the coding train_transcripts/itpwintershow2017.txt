00:00 - hello what you're about to watch is a
00:01 - highlight reel of a much longer live
00:03 - stream I teach at a program called ITP
00:05 - it to school the Arts at New York
00:07 - University at the end of every semester
00:08 - the students do a show of all their work
00:11 - it's a two-year master's program this is
00:12 - over a hundred projects that students
00:15 - been working on over the semester you
00:17 - can check out this video description for
00:18 - a link to the full two hour and 15
00:20 - minute livestream this is just a short
00:23 - highlight reel just to have it as
00:25 - something else but you can watch if you
00:26 - don't want to watch the full 1215 minute
00:28 - last room so I hope you enjoyed the
00:30 - project if you want to find out more
00:31 - about ITP or our new undergraduate
00:33 - program starting next year in 2018
00:36 - called ima interactive media arts you
00:39 - can read more about it in this video's
00:40 - description thanks for watching see you
00:43 - soon
00:55 - hi my name is Ella Nichols and my
00:58 - project visualizes pulse information
01:00 - from to people and encourages you to
01:03 - sink your heart weigh it with somebody
01:04 - else so once it gets a good pulse from
01:07 - each person it's gonna compare their
01:09 - heart rates and then we can try to sync
01:12 - all of these sensors going to Arduino
01:26 - you know you know which then goes into
01:29 - my computer and is affecting a
01:31 - processing sketch hi my name is chen tao
01:34 - this is Mei Chen we just have this
01:39 - simple mission love wings I love space
01:41 - so we have this silly idea of just
01:43 - combining idea of letting a man flying
01:46 - through space using wings and that here
01:49 - is why we built this appreciate the
01:55 - physicality of the wings so they love
01:57 - putting a young and when they're
01:59 - interacting it's really like tangible I
02:02 - guess yeah
02:03 - like it was really surprised like a lot
02:05 - of children really enjoyed the game and
02:08 - like they talked to me said it was like
02:11 - really really cool and they loved to fly
02:13 - for like like all the time I am
02:17 - Stephanie Colton and I'm a second year
02:18 - at ITP I did a project called take me to
02:21 - which is a sort of couples trace routing
02:24 - IP addresses with Google Streetview so
02:26 - I'll use p5.js org is our website and
02:29 - we'll see it go through the different
02:32 - locations all right so I picked our
02:34 - website and what we're gonna do is we're
02:36 - gonna right now it's thinking and
02:37 - looking up all the intermediate IP
02:39 - address hops that we make from our
02:42 - network here at NYU to p5.js org and so
02:46 - what we saw are the Street View
02:48 - locations of all of those organizations
02:51 - that have those intermediate IP address
02:53 - is registered so on the way we hit
02:56 - talk to our communications in Virginia
02:58 - but also in New York we hit Zao
03:01 - bandwidth and then we also finally then
03:04 - ended up at new dream network in
03:07 - California which is where p5 dot org
03:09 - p5.js org is registered okay so I'm
03:14 - Yanni Harry young Shin so this is our
03:18 - project which Kendall's and it's all
03:20 - about yeah we're making your wishes
03:23 - blowing out the candles so as fast we
03:26 - just thought about turning of LED light
03:30 - flowing by blowing out but later we
03:34 - decide to decided to apply a story and
03:38 - you know the blowing out the candles
03:40 - making your wishes on your bus birthday
03:43 - it's kind of international myth so we
03:47 - applied the story on our project and
03:49 - then we also wanted you to add some kind
03:52 - of analog interaction on it so we also
03:56 - made electronic electronic match that
03:59 - you can turn it on by striking it on the
04:02 - match box
04:05 - [Music]
04:17 - my name is Yao and this project is
04:20 - called the cosmos in the water this idea
04:23 - this project is actually a meditation
04:25 - it's it's like there is young I am
04:29 - hatton you can see from the water so
04:32 - it's about Taoism so I want people while
04:35 - they are interacting with the water they
04:37 - can feeling their relationship with
04:39 - nature so are we part of the nature or
04:42 - are we isolated from it do we want to
04:45 - control it or do we want to achieve
04:46 - balance so this project is about the
04:49 - things that I want people to think while
04:51 - they are playing with it
04:52 - Kelly can we play whack-a-mole all right
04:56 - hi I'm Kelly and my project is
04:57 - interactive whack-a-mole and so
04:59 - basically you've got 30 seconds to hit
05:01 - whatever comes up as many times as you
05:03 - can for points and bragging rights and
05:05 - you know but of course so I'm gonna
05:09 - start the game off for you and then you
05:12 - basically
05:20 - people seem to like the croc pictures
05:25 - hyukoh by Fe so my projects call micro
05:29 - failure and it's about the fungus
05:31 - Network so I'm fascinated about how
05:34 - fungus they talk to each other and
05:36 - distribute nutrition's in the forest and
05:39 - I made a metaphor to indicate like how
05:43 - human beings can also mimic that and
05:45 - better distribute information so the
05:48 - interaction it's basically
05:50 - youporn your hand at one mushroom for
05:54 - example that one and you draw a circle
05:58 - so my name is il Rosenberg and I made a
06:02 - toy drum machine all made out of wood
06:11 - mostly kids just put every possible
06:15 - magnet on the board so what happens if
06:17 - you do that yeah it just goes berserk
06:21 - but yeah I'm Shawn I'm you ha this is
06:32 - our progress like a magic sandbox you
06:35 - can play with the sand and animation
06:37 - wheel changes along with it so that's
06:40 - the music
06:52 - my name is a Chelsea I'm transition
06:54 - Virgil is made by me and my partner
06:57 - yelling and this is an installation
07:00 - project with link for stampers with my
07:03 - Gmail API so basically you're watching
07:06 - is my email stress level so every time I
07:09 - got new email stepwells being a little
07:12 - bit so if I keep annoying this email
07:16 - spell things will happen for example the
07:18 - link was filled alrighty and now we are
07:21 - on the stage too so I'm guessing maybe
07:24 - trending more emails that below will be
07:26 - popped and the ways you have stage race
07:29 - it's a today so the arm will push all
07:35 - the player on the floor and smash it and
07:38 - you have to clean the mess and the first
07:40 - one is an egg so I think you can see egg
07:43 - is the life right it can be a chicken so
07:45 - you don't want to kill life so really
07:47 - your email so this tree will listen to
07:56 - your worries and store your worries in a
07:59 - near future he will send it back to you
08:01 - so the idea is like a time capsule as
08:04 - time has your worries will be minor and
08:08 - will be true
08:10 - my name is Taryn Gutierrez I'm a first
08:13 - year graduate student and ITP
08:15 - so this project is called the starting
08:18 - line project it's a racing game followed
08:20 - by privilege so we have two players two
08:22 - users answer a sentence of ten questions
08:25 - yes or no and if the answer is yes to
08:27 - any questions they run on the yes mat
08:30 - for two seconds and they step back and
08:31 - if the answer is no to any questions
08:33 - they step on or nomads and step back and
08:35 - so our overall goal was to use
08:37 - technology as a way to make the
08:39 - conversation around privilege a little
08:41 - bit easier oftentimes it's extremely
08:43 - difficult to have so we thought that one
08:45 - of the best ways to do so is embedding
08:48 - that within the game
08:49 - my name is acai and this is my musical
08:52 - gear table it's a table with gears here
08:57 - the different instrument
09:02 - [Music]
09:07 - marimbo our debrief sorry so when you
09:11 - rotate beats you can change them maybe
09:24 - [Music]
09:34 - [Music]
09:44 - [Music]
09:47 - yes my name is Jesse Simpson together
09:50 - with my partner Ahmad we created a MIDI
09:54 - controller out of the cello so
09:57 - essentially the cello the note is picked
10:00 - up the contact microphone and then the
10:04 - frequency is analyzed in max/msp and
10:07 - then translated to a mini value and sent
10:09 - to Ableton Live where two software
10:13 - synthesizers are controlled
10:17 - the knobs here that control different
10:19 - aspects of the descent zones
10:22 - [Music]
10:35 - I'm Haley and I'm product automatic and
10:42 - actually the meaning it's a maganet
10:43 - facility so this is for the magnetic
10:46 - sound insulation and also it kind of
10:50 - like Popish instrument smooth by megan
11:00 - is like repairing itself and then like
11:02 - the other megan is so i took me around
11:04 - and i can combine like making a like
11:07 - boom-boom a gonna make a different lady
11:09 - McNown dirt in the recipe my name is
11:12 - hung and this is my pilot project this
11:15 - its name is into the darkness
11:17 - and it's a space exploration game i'll
11:20 - show you how now you see a little rocket
11:23 - on the screen and you can choose
11:30 - and and the reason why I want to make a
11:36 - controller like this is because nowadays
11:38 - people play games on keyboards and
11:40 - joysticks and Xbox controllers I wanted
11:43 - to make the control methods like more
11:45 - intuitive because just what you do is
11:49 - what you saw on the screen because I
11:51 - live with this rocket and the rocket
11:54 - goes up so
11:56 - or intuitive
11:58 - [Music]
