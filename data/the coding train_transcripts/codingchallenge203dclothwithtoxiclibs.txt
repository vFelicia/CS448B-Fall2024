00:00 - welcome to a coding challenge now you
00:02 - must go to challenge some indeterminate
00:04 - amount of time I'm going to attempt to
00:06 - build a simple cloth simulation I'm
00:10 - going to use a variety of tools for this
00:11 - I'm going to use something called
00:13 - processing and I have a little bit of
00:14 - code that I'm actually starting with
00:15 - that I will talk to you about it rarely
00:17 - has anything in it I'm also going to use
00:19 - a library called toxic lives so look in
00:22 - the description of this video find the
00:23 - link to this page download toxic libs
00:26 - complete zero zero two zero and you'll
00:28 - have the same exact version of library
00:30 - that I'm using now this library cannot
00:32 - be installed currently through the
00:34 - processing contributions manager so
00:36 - you've got to go to your finder you've
00:37 - got to go to your processing sketchbook
00:40 - and go into your libraries folder and
00:42 - take that thing that you downloaded and
00:45 - put it in there so I already have
00:46 - manually install that if you have
00:48 - trouble asking the comments maybe I'll
00:49 - make a side video that just shows you
00:51 - how to install toxic lives but once you
00:53 - have toxic libs installed you can go up
00:55 - into processing under sketch and you can
00:57 - go to import library and you can go to
01:02 - now scroll down here toxic libs complete
01:05 - and I what I want is verlet physics I'm
01:08 - going to use the verlet physics library
01:10 - now what is verlan physics why am I
01:13 - using the toxic libs library well I
01:15 - might refer you to my nature of code
01:17 - playlist that has a whole set of videos
01:20 - that covers the basics of what is verlan
01:22 - physics and the basics of how toxic
01:23 - goods works but the short one sentence
01:25 - summary here is Berlocq physics is going
01:28 - to give me a physics engine that has
01:29 - particles and Springs and i'm going to
01:32 - make my cloth essentially as a grid of
01:37 - particles now this is a terrible grid
01:41 - but you can see it that's a weird spiral
01:43 - and then have all of these connected
01:45 - with Springs
01:46 - so these particles all connected with
01:47 - Springs gravity goes into the world and
01:50 - suddenly everything's hanging down cloth
01:52 - like so let's see if we can make that
01:53 - happen
01:54 - so now I have started this up already
01:58 - just with two ArrayList I have a ray
02:00 - list of particle object and an ArrayList
02:02 - of spring objects now you might be
02:03 - asking yourself huh toxic lips has
02:06 - Berlet particle objects in it and toxic
02:09 - lips has Berlitz spring objects in it so
02:11 - why do you have your own particle in
02:12 - your
02:13 - spring objects well the way that I'm
02:14 - going to do this which is just a
02:15 - particular style is that what I'm going
02:17 - to do in my particle class is I'm going
02:19 - to say extends ver lit particle to D so
02:26 - I'm going to take a much do this in two
02:27 - dimensions first so I'm going to take
02:29 - the two-dimensional verlet particle and
02:31 - extend it and then I'm going to say
02:33 - super X Y so I'm using object-oriented
02:36 - programming inheritance I refer you to
02:38 - my video on inheritance of you aren't
02:40 - familiar with this particular concept
02:42 - and I probably have called this wrong
02:45 - but I'll let me look in here I'm going
02:49 - to all go to the Java Docs here and look
02:51 - for berlet particle 2d did I so what's
02:59 - wrong here in my errors the hierarchy of
03:03 - type particle is inconsistent oh I'm
03:08 - missing I'm sorry I'm missing so little
03:13 - did I know that I am also missing some
03:16 - classes I need from toxic libs core so I
03:20 - need to also import toxic libs core 2
03:23 - actually don't need all of this stuff so
03:25 - I could probably get rid of most of it
03:26 - but I'm just going to leave it all in
03:28 - there there's a lot of extra import
03:30 - statements and that should fix that
03:32 - error yes because Berlet particle
03:34 - actually extends something called BEC to
03:36 - D which is a vector which I would refer
03:38 - you to my tutorial series on vectors but
03:40 - I got to get moving with this coding
03:41 - challenge so I've got now a particle and
03:45 - the reason I want to do this is because
03:47 - I want to write a function that is
03:49 - capable of just displaying an ellipse
03:54 - wherever this particle is so I'm going
03:59 - to say fill 255 just going to have a
04:01 - white white ellipse wherever that
04:03 - particle is and what I'm going to do is
04:07 - I'm going to write on let's have let's
04:09 - think about our meshes the particles
04:11 - being like 10 pixels apart so I'm going
04:13 - to create a variable called W for each
04:15 - particle being 10 pixels apart and I'm
04:17 - going to say something like for int I
04:20 - equals 0 I let me just start them and
04:23 - just pick I could to be thoughtful about
04:25 - the math here
04:26 - but I'm just going to say let me have 40
04:29 - particles and I'm going to say a
04:34 - particle P is a new particle and I need
04:40 - an X and a y so I'm going to start X at
04:43 - like pixel 100 and I'm going to start Y
04:48 - maybe at like pixel 10 I'm going to make
04:53 - those new particles and then what do I
04:55 - want to do I want to add those particles
04:59 - to my ArrayList and now I want to say
05:02 - for every particle in my ArrayList I
05:08 - want to display those particles so let's
05:11 - run this and you can see ah whoops knock
05:14 - over a light you can see I forgot to
05:17 - move them around so I want each particle
05:19 - to move over by 10 pixels and you can
05:24 - see there we go these are all my
05:26 - particles so my particles right now thou
05:28 - however are not experiencing any physics
05:31 - I want them to experience physics so in
05:33 - order for them to experience physics I
05:35 - need to create a physics object I'm
05:39 - looking over here I need to create a
05:40 - verlet physics object I'm going to make
05:42 - a 2-d one I'm going to say Berlet
05:45 - physics 2d physics and then in setup I'm
05:52 - going to create that physics world is a
05:56 - new verle it and I'll extend this into
05:58 - 3d later I'm going to make a new physics
06:01 - world and then what am I going to do I
06:05 - need to say physics dot add particle P
06:09 - so what I've got here is I want all the
06:12 - particles to also experience physics but
06:16 - they don't seem to be doing anything yet
06:17 - okay well let's put in some gravity so
06:20 - one of the things that's also available
06:21 - in the toxic clubs library is a gravity
06:25 - behavior and a gravity behavior is just
06:27 - like a vector and I can now I can say
06:33 - let me add a gravity let me create a
06:37 - vector called gravity whee
06:40 - is a new vector that points where down
06:43 - so zero comma 10 it's going to point
06:46 - down and I'm going to say gravity
06:48 - behavior GB is a new gravity behavior
06:55 - with what that gravity vector and then
07:00 - I'm going to say physics and I guess
07:02 - that is a what did I spell wrong gravity
07:06 - behavior do I spell that correctly oh
07:11 - yes yeah why is it not know what it is
07:14 - it's ambiguous because there are more
07:17 - than one there's toxic physics behaviors
07:20 - and there's toxics physics 2d behaviors
07:23 - so I'm going to go here and right now
07:26 - we're going to live in 2d so I'm just
07:29 - going to do everything in 2d so that
07:30 - fixed that and now I'm gonna say physics
07:32 - dot add behavior GB ok how we doing here
07:39 - now we have gravity let's run this still
07:42 - nothing why well I think I probably
07:45 - forgot a really crucial step I made
07:47 - particles I added them to the physics
07:49 - I made gravity I added to the physics
07:50 - but I forgot to say physics move forward
07:54 - with time so I need to say I think in
07:56 - draw physics dot step I'm guessing it's
08:02 - physics dot step and let me run this
08:04 - whoops I'm in the wrong place ok so that
08:08 - does not exist so let's go to in my
08:11 - documentation here vertol it known
08:14 - overlayed physics 2d let's look at the
08:17 - functions get get time step setting on a
08:23 - set time step update ok so I need to
08:26 - update not step update and should
08:30 - hopefully have some default time step
08:32 - yeah there we go
08:33 - did you see how those particles fall
08:35 - super fast well may I can make the
08:37 - gravity a little less strong and you can
08:40 - see they're all falling now they all
08:41 - just fell because there's nothing
08:43 - holding them anywhere so what I want to
08:45 - now do is put springs between them so
08:48 - what I need to do I made 40 particles
08:51 - and what I want to do now
08:53 - is go through and say I'm going to go
08:59 - through that array and what I'm going to
09:03 - do is and I'm going to not go all the
09:06 - way to the end of it what I want to do
09:08 - is I need to create okay so I need
09:10 - particle a is element I so I want to get
09:17 - the first thing from the array which is
09:19 - I and it's with an ArrayList it's dot
09:22 - size so I want to get particle I and
09:26 - then I also want to get particle B to be
09:30 - the next one I plus one and what do I
09:33 - want to create I want to create a verlet
09:34 - spring 2d so a spring is a connection
09:38 - between those two particles is a new
09:41 - verlet spring between a and B and then I
09:44 - think the last argument are there's two
09:47 - arguments maybe there's like the
09:48 - strength or a minimum distance I don't
09:51 - really remember let's go look here I'm
09:53 - going to click on Berlet spring 2d and
09:55 - look at the constructor and it says a B
09:58 - length and strength ah so a default
10:01 - length
10:02 - what's the resting length of a spring
10:04 - right if you pull a spring and it kind
10:06 - of bounces back where does it rest and
10:07 - then the strength like how long how
10:09 - strong is it so so I don't see really a
10:13 - particular variable range for strength
10:16 - so we're going to have to guess so I'm
10:19 - going to say the default length is W and
10:23 - the default let me just add a strength
10:25 - of 0.5 okay and then what I need to do
10:29 - is add that spring to the springs
10:33 - ArrayList and then say physics add
10:36 - spring s oh and I actually want this to
10:41 - be a spring so I actually forgot that I
10:44 - have my own spring object my own spring
10:47 - object just connects to Springs and in
10:49 - there this should extend Berlet spring
10:54 - to D and then what I want to do is call
11:00 - super a B and then W 0.5 so I want to
11:05 - make it a spring but
11:07 - these two particles with a distance of
11:09 - resting length of W and a strength of
11:11 - 0.5 and then I also want to write my
11:13 - display function and my display function
11:17 - is stroke 255 line between a and B so
11:25 - what have I done I now made my own
11:26 - spring which extends the Toxic lips
11:28 - Berlet springs it's a spring that
11:31 - connects two particles and a display it
11:32 - is just a line so now we should be able
11:36 - to go back here and I should be able to
11:38 - say let's also display all of the
11:44 - springs okay so you see that's falling
11:51 - down now here's the thing what's
11:53 - exciting about this now that they're
11:54 - connected with Springs is if one is not
11:57 - moving the others should kind of stay
12:00 - connected to it somehow so one thing
12:02 - that I can do is I can lock particles so
12:07 - I'm going to say just a random particle
12:10 - it's not a random one it's the first one
12:12 - I'm going to say P lock I think this
12:15 - will take this particle and lock it in
12:18 - place meaning it never moves even if the
12:19 - physics moves there you go so you can
12:22 - see I have this nice springy string
12:25 - right now so just from locking that
12:27 - first particle let's lock also let's
12:35 - lock another one
12:46 - whoops p1 this should be p1 this should
12:50 - be p2 I'm going to lock both of these
12:52 - particles here we go
12:54 - we have this nice little springy thing
12:57 - now I actually don't really want to
12:58 - display the particles I really just want
13:01 - to see the springs because that's what I
13:03 - have right now and I could maybe just so
13:04 - you could see it a little bit better
13:05 - I could make strokeweight - we can look
13:10 - and we see we have this nice bungee cord
13:13 - like thing bounces and rests now here's
13:16 - the thing this is just a string and I
13:18 - want to program a cloth and I want that
13:20 - cloth to be in 3d so we've kind of cut
13:23 - I've kind of done the core mechanic here
13:24 - in a way I'm done but what I need to
13:27 - figure out now is okay what I did was I
13:30 - said particle particle particle particle
13:32 - particle particle particle particle
13:34 - connect with the spring connected the
13:35 - spring connect with a spring connect
13:36 - with the spring connect with the spring
13:37 - connect connect with a spring what I
13:39 - need to do now is say particle particle
13:41 - vertical vertical vertical particle and
13:43 - then have another one another row of
13:45 - particles and all these are connected
13:47 - and all these are connected and then
13:48 - this is they're also connected to the
13:50 - particle above it so this is going to be
13:52 - a little bit trickier but I think
13:55 - totally doable let's see if we can work
13:57 - this out in our head and by our head I
14:00 - keep by head right now so one thing that
14:03 - I might like to do is okay so here's
14:08 - where I'm creating the particles so you
14:11 - know one possibility would be I think an
14:13 - easy way to do this would actually be to
14:14 - use a 2d array so this was now this
14:19 - would now be particles that are 40 by 40
14:21 - and I always want them to start with X
14:25 - at 100 and why it's sorry X so only
14:31 - think about this so for the very first
14:33 - particle we want them to start at x and
14:38 - y equals 100 V for the outer loop I will
14:43 - have B the columns I guess so first the
14:48 - inner loop we go down so we always start
14:51 - with Y is 10 here and then Y gets set
14:55 - back to 0 so Y gets it back to a Y goes
14:57 - up sorry Y goes up y equals y
15:00 - i plus w so for every i so this is what
15:06 - are we doing here why we started x as
15:09 - 100 y equals 10 and then we go down all
15:13 - the Y's then we increase over by X and
15:17 - reset Y so I'm doing this as columns
15:19 - first I could room I could put J on the
15:21 - outside but this should give me a
15:23 - particle now and I'm going to get rid of
15:28 - the springs we should at least and I'm
15:31 - going to get rid of the gravity we
15:33 - should at least see a grid of particles
15:34 - now okay I don't see any particles
15:36 - because I turned off particles not
15:38 - display why did I delete that I should
15:47 - just commented it out okay that's
15:51 - perfect I see my grid of particles and
15:52 - maybe 40 by 40 somehow I magically like
15:55 - centered it with math I don't know by
15:58 - accident 600 by 600 yeah you can see
16:02 - okay so that you see there you see
16:04 - that's my grid of particles so now I
16:06 - need to figure out how to connect all of
16:09 - the Springs properly so I think for me
16:13 - right now there's a lot of different
16:14 - ways I could do this but I'm actually
16:15 - just going to change this to a
16:19 - two-dimensional particle array which is
16:23 - 40 by 40 and honestly I should 100% be
16:27 - using variables for those numbers but
16:29 - just for simplicity right now 40 by 40
16:32 - and what I'm going to do here is not I
16:35 - just need to say now particles I index J
16:42 - equals P and I can simplify this I don't
16:47 - need two lines of code here actually no
16:49 - I do because I want to also add it to
16:50 - the physics so I just changed to a 2d
16:52 - array and then in this no longer works
16:56 - because I now need to and let me make
16:58 - these variables I'm going to make in
17:02 - columns equals 40 in rows equals 40 so
17:06 - I'm going to use those
17:10 - and columns because these are going to
17:13 - appear in a lot of places columns rows
17:17 - and because what I want now is to just
17:22 - to check to make sure it's working I
17:25 - need this I need this loop again in a
17:27 - lot of places to display all them
17:36 - I want to have this loop and draw to
17:39 - loop through the two-dimensional array
17:41 - and this should be a dot obviously so I
17:45 - still should have oh oh so this is not
17:47 - going to work anymore the locking I'll
17:48 - fix that it's going to make things
17:49 - easier so now okay
17:51 - now I have my two dimensional array of
17:53 - particles brilliant okay
17:56 - so what do I do now now what I need to
17:59 - do is take this loop and connect
18:02 - everything whoops
18:04 - so what I'm going to do is similar to
18:07 - what I did down here for every single
18:12 - particle I need to connect to the right
18:15 - and down so what I can do is actually I
18:18 - only want to go from zero to columns
18:20 - minus 1 and then rows I want to skip
18:23 - every row right because if I'm over here
18:29 - and I connect this particle to this one
18:32 - oh no no I don't want to skip any row I
18:34 - just don't need to connect back up so as
18:36 - I connect each particle to the right and
18:38 - the below everything will be connected
18:40 - yeah yeah this is going to work and then
18:43 - we stopped at rows minus one so this is
18:46 - actually not so bad so I first need a
18:49 - particle a one is particles I J and
18:57 - particle a two is particles I plus 1 J
19:01 - now be B 1 a 1 and B 1 and then I want a
19:07 - 2 and B 2 so that's connecting to the
19:10 - right and then connecting down is J plus
19:13 - 1 so these are particles a and B connect
19:17 - to the right a 1 and B 1 a 1 and B and
19:20 - and actually don't need a 2 I just need
19:24 - a and B 1 and B 2 so that one particle
19:27 - gets connected to the right and below so
19:29 - how did I make a spring this is how I
19:31 - made a spring so I'm going to say spring
19:36 - s1 spring Springs add add to the
19:41 - ArrayList and add to the physics and
19:44 - then this should all comment out it goes
19:48 - from A to B 1
19:49 - a 2b - this is spring - there's probably
19:52 - some like slightly more efficient thing
19:55 - I can do here but this is now be going
19:57 - through every particle and connecting to
19:58 - the right and connecting it down so and
20:01 - I can delete what I had here and
20:04 - eventually I'm going to want to lock
20:05 - particles again but let's let's run this
20:08 - one more time so we can see okay all the
20:10 - particles there they're all connected
20:11 - let me not display the particles anymore
20:15 - so you can see there's the grid
20:17 - there's the grid of everything being
20:20 - connected with Springs so what if I add
20:24 - gravity back in everything falls but now
20:29 - what if I lock and what I want to lock
20:32 - is what I want to lock particles zero
20:36 - zero lock and then I also want to lock
20:39 - another particle on the top which is
20:40 - zero which is the end which is columns
20:46 - -1 index 0 so this there we go oh look
20:51 - at that
20:52 - look at my crazy swinging hanging cloth
20:54 - there we go you know I could lock one in
20:56 - the middle too if I wanted so this is
20:58 - now interesting where we could start to
21:00 - play with this value like the strength
21:02 - of the springs you can see whoa the
21:04 - string is like soot the spring excuse me
21:06 - are really strong probably way too
21:07 - strong maybe the max is supposed to be
21:09 - one you can see here you know very
21:12 - different if I make this 0.01 like whoa
21:17 - look how could you saying that is it
21:19 - ever going to bounce back up it's so
21:21 - weak look at the craziness that it's
21:22 - doing but now we do we least and let me
21:25 - let me make this like I'm going to make
21:27 - this like point eight I think it's a
21:28 - kind of reasonable number so you can see
21:30 - there's my cloth hanging and it looks
21:32 - very three-dimensional but everything
21:34 - that I've done here is two-dimensional
21:35 - so let's just see briefly if we can make
21:40 - this three-dimensional okay let's see if
21:44 - we can make this three-dimensional push
21:45 - forward in this particular coding
21:47 - challenge I have no idea how long I've
21:49 - been doing this for but you will know
21:50 - this by how long the video is
21:52 - eventually when it's published so I'm
21:54 - going to save this I'm going to say this
21:56 - that was actually the 2d one so I'm
21:58 - going to just say this is three cloth
21:59 - underscore so I'm saving both of those I
22:01 - also want to
22:02 - I want to kind of clean up now I'll
22:06 - clean this up later so I'm going to
22:07 - clean up the imports and all of that
22:08 - later and what I'm going to do is sketch
22:12 - when I publish the code on github I'll
22:15 - clean up all the imports that are
22:16 - unnecessary I'm going to go back to
22:18 - Verla physics and great and I don't want
22:22 - the 2d physics anymore so let's see now
22:26 - if we could convert this to 3d so this
22:28 - should now be just a Verla particle and
22:32 - I should now say X Y Z let's not worry
22:36 - about the display for a second and the
22:38 - spring should just be a ver lit spring
22:40 - this should not change at all it's just
22:42 - not a 3d spring anymore and here I
22:48 - should say verlet physics to have 3d
22:52 - physics gravity behavior and now this
22:57 - needs to be a 3d vector for 3d and I'm
23:03 - still going to point along the y axis
23:05 - for now and everything else should just
23:09 - be the same especially if I make that
23:11 - zero and I'm going to say P 3d and I'm
23:18 - going to run this so this should be
23:21 - identical so this is now running in P 3d
23:23 - and it's actually technically happening
23:26 - the math is happening in 3d but I'm just
23:28 - seeing the same exact 2d visualization I
23:30 - will make it more 3d in a second so what
23:34 - I want to do here is first in spring I
23:36 - want to add this and you know
23:43 - technically I should fix this like I
23:45 - should have this draw in 3d somehow and
23:50 - I should say translate XYZ but to be
23:55 - honest with you I'm not going to display
23:58 - the particles so I can ignore that so
24:00 - I'm going to run this and make sure this
24:01 - is still working there we go now let's
24:04 - think about this what I want now is to
24:08 - maybe pin the cloth on four corners on
24:12 - the top and see it fall down
24:15 - from the from the middle so there's a
24:20 - couple ways I could do this
24:21 - number one is let's think about our view
24:24 - here we've created all of these I think
24:27 - what I want to do is at the beginning of
24:29 - draw I want to translate to the center
24:31 - so I want 0 0 to be the center of my
24:35 - window right now and what I actually
24:37 - want to do it's let's not use x and y
24:41 - anymore
24:42 - I want to start let's use X which is
24:46 - horizontal and Z which is forward so I
24:49 - want to turn Y into Z so X should
24:51 - actually start at negative 50 and this
24:55 - should now become Z and I'm going to
25:00 - have Z start like kind of far away from
25:02 - us I'll start it at negative 100 and
25:07 - then I want to create these particles at
25:10 - X and I'm going to have Y just be 0 so
25:13 - I'm going to create the particle at X 0
25:14 - Z now let's see what happens
25:16 - ooh ok well first of all I want to let's
25:23 - take out the gravity behavior and just
25:25 - see if things look right so it looks
25:28 - kind of reasonable but it's sort of hard
25:30 - to say let's start Z at negative 50 and
25:36 - let me add some rotation here and draw
25:40 - so let me rotate along let me spin
25:44 - around the x-axis by some angle and I
25:52 - could add PZ cam just to like spin
25:54 - around things that might actually even
25:55 - be better
25:56 - oh so it looks like all the particles
26:00 - are in a line so what did I mess up here
26:03 - oh this is this is look at this this is
26:06 - needs to be X change both of those
26:10 - things to Z somebody already mentioned
26:12 - that in the chat ok good so now we can
26:15 - see my mesh I don't have it in exactly
26:18 - centered in the right place I'm going to
26:20 - just speculate i-40 particles separated
26:22 - by 10 right do I have 40 particles and
26:26 - they're separated by 10 I should go back
26:28 - I was going to say negative 200 yeah so
26:32 - I think negative 200 and let's just
26:34 - start it much further away there we go
26:38 - so you can see there is my mesh now it's
26:41 - spinning around and let me take out this
26:44 - rotation and actually let me wear let me
26:49 - let me take out this rotation and let me
26:52 - actually move Y up so where I just want
26:54 - to move Y up by like negative 100 so now
26:58 - there it is there's my mesh sitting
27:01 - there that's my cloth it's now in 3d
27:03 - Springs are all attached I should be
27:06 - able to put gravity back in I forgot
27:08 - what parts of it I pinned so we'll find
27:11 - out and you can see oh there it is in 3d
27:15 - it's kind of like a flag waving thing
27:17 - now I was going to pin all the corners
27:19 - so let's pin one more corner just for
27:21 - fun so I'm going to pin a columns minus
27:26 - 1 rows minus 1 think that'll Det now I'm
27:29 - going to pin 3 corners ooh what did I
27:33 - that didn't work uh isn't that another
27:37 - corner let's try whoops I don't know why
27:48 - that didn't work there we go
27:50 - now I pinned so let's think about this
27:53 - oh now that should still work that last
27:57 - corner columns minus 1
28:05 - am i off by one somehow because of the
28:07 - way I did there we go so I don't know
28:11 - why did so you can see there's my cloth
28:12 - now it's like a hammock this is a this
28:14 - is a coding challenge hammock generator
28:17 - but you get the idea now I'm not I
28:19 - haven't done anything with drawing here
28:21 - I could really turn this in to a mesh
28:23 - with begin shape and shape and triangle
28:25 - mesh I could put lighting in it toxic
28:27 - libs actually has these constraints so I
28:29 - could put like a sphere constraint have
28:30 - the cloth just fall on it and fold over
28:32 - the sphere and fall on to a ground toxic
28:35 - lips has a lot of features also for
28:37 - turning these into graphics meshes and
28:38 - texturing them but you get the right eye
28:42 - people in the chatter telling me oh it
28:44 - has no Springs I don't know oh it has no
28:46 - springs so I lock that so that's what
28:48 - the issue is that bottom right hand
28:50 - particle I don't actually attach it with
28:52 - any Springs because I'm not doing
28:54 - diagonal Springs the kind of doing this
28:56 - for a half an hour now that these
28:57 - cameras go across so that's the reason
29:00 - why that bottom one isn't working just
29:02 - to come back over here for a second
29:03 - right let's say this is the bottom
29:05 - particle these particles are connected
29:08 - and these particles are connected but
29:10 - this is not connected to anything now if
29:12 - I were connecting them also to the right
29:15 - which would be interesting let's add
29:17 - let's do that I know this video was over
29:19 - but if you're already watching this for
29:21 - a half an hour you will watch it a few
29:23 - more minutes but let's go and add a
29:26 - particle B 3 which would be I plus 1 J
29:31 - plus 1 and then spring s3 so now I'm
29:35 - adding a third spring and then I can go
29:40 - ahead and now first let me and lock that
29:43 - last particle but let's let's take these
29:46 - out and run this and just see how it
29:50 - pays so that's kind of interesting oh it
29:53 - has this like it's sort of like off to
29:55 - the side because like the last particles
29:57 - aren't connected down I should really do
30:00 - I really need to do the last row so
30:01 - there's lots of little flaws here that's
30:03 - sort of interesting to see how how much
30:05 - that changes it so I need to take that
30:07 - last row and connect down but not to the
30:09 - right you can see look what I've done
30:10 - now connecting them I've just like
30:12 - mutant hammock but you get the idea I'll
30:14 - clean up this
30:15 - and make it sort of nicer and have all
30:17 - the springs connected properly before I
30:19 - post it but you get the idea I hope
30:21 - you've learned something from watching
30:22 - this video I skipped over a ton of
30:24 - things that are part of toxic libs and
30:26 - Berlin physics but you know I'll try to
30:28 - link back to my other videos that cover
30:30 - vectors and toxic libs but hopefully
30:32 - you'll be able to do something with this
30:33 - and create some sort of interesting
30:34 - simulation or plot project and share it
30:37 - with me thanks for watching this coding
30:38 - challenge
