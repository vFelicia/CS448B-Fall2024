00:00 - hello and welcome back to another
00:01 - discord bot tutorial now since the last
00:03 - time i recorded those first three videos
00:05 - i have been very busy
00:07 - i have deployed the bot that i made in
00:09 - the previous video
00:10 - uh via glitch so you can see here and
00:13 - you can follow the link in the video's
00:14 - description to the code on glitch
00:16 - and the bot is running if i head on over
00:18 - i should change one thing if i just
00:20 - uh type in chew chew exclamation point
00:23 - choo choo and i will talk about why i'm
00:25 - using exclamation point
00:26 - in the next video when i talk about
00:28 - handling multiple commands but for now
00:30 - let's just make sure it's working there
00:32 - we go i get my response back
00:35 - and if i come back to here let's look at
00:38 - the code
00:39 - something rather significant has changed
00:41 - i know it's a really tiny font so i'm
00:42 - going to zoom on in
00:44 - client.login look the token is no longer
00:47 - there right
00:48 - here's the code that i have in vs code
00:51 - in visual studio code with
00:52 - the token right there that i should not
00:54 - be showing you because
00:56 - that private key that i must keep
00:57 - private returning back again to glitch
01:00 - it's there process.env.token what's
01:04 - going on
01:05 - so environment variables are variables
01:07 - that can be configured
01:09 - on a particular server separate from
01:12 - your code
01:13 - so your code can be released in public
01:15 - for example you can
01:16 - go to the link and see this code but
01:19 - your environment variables
01:20 - are stored securely in a file or
01:24 - it could be other ways around it but a
01:25 - sort of convention is to store them in a
01:27 - file called
01:28 - dot env so if you follow this link
01:31 - you won't see the contents of env you
01:34 - will however see the contents of dot env
01:36 - sample
01:36 - which you can look at to see these are
01:39 - the environment variables
01:40 - that i happen to be storing and the
01:42 - really important one here of course is
01:43 - token
01:44 - the way i'm using server id and channel
01:46 - id just to like limit the bot to a
01:48 - particular server and channel
01:49 - is kind of an optional thing at this
01:51 - point but the token
01:52 - is really really critical and just to
01:54 - show you what it looks like i'll
01:55 - regenerate the token again
01:57 - to switch it out if i go here to env on
01:59 - glitch
02:00 - it's actually giving me an interface to
02:02 - show here's the token here's its value
02:04 - but if i click up here on plain text i
02:06 - can see this is what it actually looks
02:08 - like token equals that very long
02:10 - string so returning back to the code
02:13 - that i have locally in visual studio
02:14 - code and i will cover in a separate
02:16 - video how to deploy to glitch it's
02:18 - i definitely would encourage you there's
02:20 - lots of different uh web servers and
02:22 - hosting
02:23 - platforms that you could use to deploy
02:24 - your bot and i meant you could even run
02:25 - your own raspberry pi
02:27 - or your own computer but that's not the
02:29 - topic of this video i just want to look
02:31 - at
02:31 - getting an environment variable set up
02:34 - so the first thing that i need to do
02:36 - is create a file and make a new file and
02:38 - i'm going to call it dot env
02:41 - and in that file i want to say token
02:43 - equals and maybe i want to be a little
02:45 - bit more specific let's call it
02:46 - bot token and then i want to paste the
02:49 - value of the token
02:50 - there setting that environment variable
02:52 - to that value i can go back to the
02:54 - browser
02:54 - go to my developer page i might as well
02:58 - regenerate well i'll regenerate it later
02:59 - i'm just going to hit copy
03:02 - paste it in here you can see it's that
03:03 - same token it's there
03:05 - and then the idea is that i could say
03:08 - right here
03:09 - instead of this process dot env
03:13 - bot token now this won't actually work
03:17 - let's check and see why so one thing
03:19 - actually i want to do is
03:20 - let me disable the bot on glitch to make
03:22 - sure that it's not
03:23 - the one running so that i can be sure
03:25 - when i'm testing that and the one that's
03:27 - running
03:27 - is the one that's running here locally
03:29 - on my computer it's kind of silly but
03:31 - i'm just going to comment
03:32 - out all the code on glitch i'm sure
03:33 - there's another way to sort of disable
03:34 - the web application through the
03:35 - interface
03:37 - and now let me say nodebot.js to run
03:39 - this
03:40 - okay it's telling me an invalid token
03:43 - was provided
03:44 - if you're just working with a node like
03:46 - i am just well you know on a mac laptop
03:48 - uh with a dot env file this process.enb
03:51 - bot token is not gonna just work
03:53 - magically
03:54 - servers like glitch or heroku or other
03:56 - kind of platforms are set up to use a
03:58 - dot env file
03:59 - but i've got to include a special code
04:01 - to use that dot env file and the code
04:03 - that i want to use
04:04 - is called dot env so i want to require
04:08 - the nodepackage.env
04:10 - and then i can actually just it's just
04:12 - one line of code require
04:14 - the dot env package and call the config
04:16 - function
04:17 - that is the function you call to tell it
04:19 - to load the values from the dot env file
04:22 - but if i run this right now it's going
04:24 - to say cannot find the module.env
04:27 - that's because i have to say
04:28 - npminstall.env so i've got to do that as
04:30 - well
04:32 - we can check package.json to see that
04:34 - now it is a new dependency
04:36 - in addition to discord.js i also have
04:38 - dot env as a dependency
04:40 - and now ah it's running
04:44 - let's see what happens if i go back over
04:46 - to discord
04:48 - and type in exclamation point choo choo
04:51 - i'm getting some why am i always going
04:53 - getting choo choo back
04:54 - there we go i got some emojis great so
04:56 - that's actually all i wanted to show you
04:58 - in this video
04:59 - um i could consid think about are there
05:02 - other
05:02 - things that are sort of like custom
05:04 - settings that i don't want to
05:06 - package as part of my source code and
05:09 - and you know for example it could be
05:11 - that the channel id or the server id
05:13 - are those and so i would say practice
05:16 - try to follow along and get env working
05:19 - with
05:19 - your code and in the next video i want
05:22 - to look at
05:22 - multiple commands but actually right i
05:25 - mean certainly i could just have an if
05:26 - statement that's what i'm going to start
05:27 - with so in the next video i'm just going
05:28 - to show you how i handle two commands
05:30 - if the content of the messages choo choo
05:33 - reply with one of these replies
05:35 - if the content of the messages
05:37 - exclamation point i don't know
05:38 - gif something then i want to reply with
05:41 - a gif
05:42 - so i'm going to show you how to post
05:43 - gifs and that way we have two commands
05:46 - with an if statement
05:47 - and then the follow-up video to that you
05:49 - know if statement isn't going to be very
05:50 - sustainable
05:51 - if you want to have a bot that can
05:52 - handle you know 10 20 100 commands
05:55 - how do i write uh create a system
05:57 - structure for handling multiple commands
05:59 - and within different javascript files
06:01 - in a way that's sort of scalable and
06:03 - manageable okay so
06:04 - stay tuned in the next video we're gonna
06:06 - make our bot post i don't know
06:08 - kitten gifts or coding train gifts or
06:10 - who knows what
