00:00 - If you're here,
you're about to start
00:02 - the Working with Data and APIs
course on the coding train.
00:05 - So what I want to do in
this video is pretty simple.
00:07 - I just want to give you a quick
list of all the things you
00:10 - either need to know before
you start the course
00:12 - and what kind of tools
and software and things
00:14 - you need to have
running on a computer
00:16 - in order to be able follow
along in the tutorials.
00:18 - So probably the
most important thing
00:20 - is just JavaScript, the
programming language itself.
00:22 - So if you're a total new
programmer, if you never
00:24 - programmed before,
maybe you want
00:25 - to check out my intro
series about learning
00:27 - to code with JavaScript
using the P5 JS library.
00:30 - Also it would be really
helpful if you understood
00:32 - the basics of HTML, how
to write an HTML web
00:35 - page, what the Dom is, what
Dom elements are on the page.
00:39 - So if that's new
to you, once again,
00:41 - I offer you some resources
in this video's description.
00:45 - Knowing a little bit about
CSS or cascading style sheets
00:47 - could also be useful, but
definitely not required.
00:50 - And that really covers
all of the things
00:52 - that you need to know
before you get started.
00:54 - So now let me move
on to what do you
00:56 - need to have operationally
on your computer
00:58 - to follow the tutorials.
00:59 - So first, thing you
need is a code editor.
01:02 - In the videos, I'm using
Visual Studio Code.
01:04 - It's a pretty popular code
editor that a lot of people
01:06 - use now, but there's no
reason you need to use it.
01:08 - You could use a number
of any other text editor
01:11 - that you could find
on your computer,
01:12 - Atom is one, Brackets, Sublime,
there's somebody text editors.
01:17 - Everybody has their favorite.
01:18 - You also don't need to
use a text editor locally
01:20 - on your computer.
01:21 - You could use, at
least for module 1,
01:23 - you could use an online code
editor, Code Pen, JS Fiddle,
01:27 - the P5 web editor, any
of these would work.
01:30 - But if you want to follow
on exactly what I'm doing,
01:32 - Visual Studio Code is the
editor that I'm using.
01:34 - Because I'm using a
local text editor,
01:36 - in order for the examples
I'm writing to work,
01:38 - I also need to run a
web server, and a lot
01:41 - of the text editors like Visual
Studio Code, for example,
01:43 - have extensions that will
run a web server for you.
01:46 - You can run a web server
by typing in some commands
01:49 - into your terminal
access to your computer.
01:51 - And so actually if
this is new to you,
01:53 - I might refer you to
my workflow series
01:56 - where I cover how to
download a text editor,
01:58 - how to get shell
access, terminal
02:00 - access to your computer, how
to launch a web server, all
02:03 - of that sort of stuff.
02:05 - But things really
change when I get
02:07 - into modules 2 and
3 of this series,
02:10 - because there I start using
something called Node dot JS,
02:13 - so you absolutely
will want to have
02:16 - shell access to your computer.
02:17 - You'll notice I'm using an
application called iTerm, which
02:20 - is a Mac terminal application.
02:23 - You can use just the default
Mac terminal application.
02:25 - If you're on Windows,
the command prompt.
02:28 - Power Shell, Get Bash,
if you're on Linux.
02:30 - I assume you know what you're
doing in terms of shell access.
02:33 - So that's what you can
use, because you're
02:34 - going to want to
download and install
02:36 - Node and run node commands
from terminal itself.
02:39 - You don't actually need
to do this right now,
02:41 - because when I get
in to module 2,
02:42 - I'll explain to you what Node
is and how to install it,
02:44 - but if you want to
be up and running
02:46 - and ready for that go
ahead and install that now.
02:48 - At the very end
of this course, I
02:49 - look at deploying your project
to a web server in the cloud,
02:52 - and there I make
use of something
02:54 - called Git, which is version
control software, and GitHub,
02:57 - which is a website where
you can take your Git repos
03:00 - and put them on line.
03:02 - That may be completely
unfamiliar to you.
03:03 - I will give you a sort
of basic primer on that
03:06 - when I get to that,
but that's certainly
03:07 - will be something that you
might want to check out.
03:09 - I have a video
series about GitHub
03:11 - as well, before you get
started with this course,
03:13 - but it won't come in all
the way until module 3.
03:16 - So hopefully, I've
covered everything
03:17 - that you need to
know before you get
03:19 - started with this first video.
03:20 - I am sure that I have
forgotten something,
03:22 - so I'd encourage you to check
out the video's description,
03:25 - because as people are
watching the course,
03:26 - they're asking questions, and I
realize I'm forgetting things.
03:29 - I will add them to the
video's description.
03:30 - So at least there there will be
a list with links of everything
03:32 - that you might need to know
or have before you get started
03:35 - with the first video.
03:35 - So that's it.
03:38 - This is it.
03:39 - I'll see you in the next video.
03:41 - Oh, I do have my train whistle.
03:42 - Goodbye.
