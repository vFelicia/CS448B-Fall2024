00:00 - all right I'm back so this now in this
00:03 - video I'm gonna look at
00:04 - three-dimensional geometry no first of
00:06 - all actually let's not even look at
00:08 - three three-dimensional geometry just
00:10 - yet
00:10 - this is three dimensional geometry it's
00:13 - a rectangle let me do a couple things
00:16 - I'm gonna just get rid of the fill so
00:19 - it's fine that it's black right now
00:20 - we'll deal with sort of color and that
00:22 - sort of stuff later
00:23 - I'm gonna just change the background of
00:24 - 255 so I can see it a bit more easily or
00:27 - I like to see where the canvas is I'm
00:28 - gonna make the background 175 okay now
00:31 - I'm gonna also say rect mode Center and
00:36 - let me make it like a little bit bigger
00:38 - and I'm gonna actually make it a
00:40 - rectangle so we can see oh look at that
00:42 - whoa oh cool so look at this this is
00:46 - such an exciting moment here why what
00:49 - what what's that so one thing one thing
00:52 - you will soon discover if you choose to
00:55 - embark on this journey into three
00:56 - dimensions is that shapes if you think
01:00 - of like oh we're gonna make a sphere or
01:02 - a torus which is like this doughnut
01:04 - shape or a pyramid shapes are actually
01:06 - three dimensional shapes three
01:08 - dimensional geometry are really
01:09 - collections of lots of small 2d polygons
01:12 - all tiled next to each other and we're
01:15 - gonna see more and more examples of this
01:17 - and amusingly through whatever sort of
01:19 - default rendering that's happening right
01:21 - now I'm seeing the full what the often
01:24 - referred to as the wireframe of this
01:26 - rectangle which I don't know why
01:27 - suddenly that appeared like when it
01:30 - wasn't before it soon as like but so
01:35 - let's see if we can let's say let's see
01:36 - if I can say no stroke to get rid of
01:38 - that there we go and now it's white I'm
01:42 - just curious
01:43 - let's give it a color now it's black
01:47 - interesting I don't know what I did
01:48 - before
01:49 - let's give it yeah okay so I'm in WebGL
01:52 - and this is the thing I can still work
01:56 - with two-dimensional drawing in the same
01:58 - way but how can I prove that I really am
02:01 - in 3d so one thing you might have
02:03 - noticed that no no that you can do let's
02:05 - career let's let's make a variable
02:06 - called angle and set it equal to zero
02:09 - and I am going to right before I draw
02:12 - the rectangle
02:13 - say rotate by that angle and then I'm
02:16 - going to every time through draw
02:17 - increase the angle a little bit angle
02:20 - plus equals zero point you know zero
02:22 - seven or something some arbitrary number
02:23 - so let's refresh now look at this cannot
02:29 - what's this cannot read properly
02:32 - transpose three times three this looks
02:35 - horribly and scary and awful let's see
02:37 - if we can find somewhere mmm okay so it
02:40 - would really be nice someday we're gonna
02:42 - figure out a way for p5 to give us a
02:44 - little bit of a friendlier error message
02:46 - and actually if you go back to that
02:48 - processing or medium blog you'll see
02:50 - that I'm Alyce Chun has worked on this
02:52 - whole p5 just friendly error system but
02:53 - that's a separate the reason this is
02:55 - happening is that rotate in 2d if I have
02:59 - a two dimensional plane
03:05 - this is a two dimensional plane and I
03:08 - say rotate there's only one way to
03:10 - rotate but if I'm living in a three
03:13 - dimensional world I can now rotate by
03:16 - what axis this is the x axis so this is
03:19 - rotating along the x axis this is the y
03:22 - axis so this is rotating along the y
03:24 - axis or the z axis is the equivalent of
03:27 - rotating in 2d so I could say rotate Z
03:31 - and refresh the sketch let me move this
03:36 - over a little bit
03:37 - suddenly there we go I've got my
03:39 - rotating square now are we really in 3d
03:43 - I'm not sure yet but let's change this
03:46 - to rotate X now we can see the three
03:51 - dimension look at this it's like I'm
03:52 - very worried it's gonna hit me now the
03:55 - important thing to realize I mean this
03:57 - might be seems so ridiculously obvious
03:59 - but I feel obligated must state it this
04:02 - is still a two dimensional plane
04:04 - there's nothing three-dimensional about
04:06 - this all we have done is unlocked a
04:08 - separate rendering engine which knows
04:11 - how to create the illusion of 3d
04:13 - perspective so who's to say whether I
04:17 - you know have a square and make it
04:20 - bigger and smaller is the square growing
04:22 - and shrinking or is it zoom
04:24 - and out in the third dimension but this
04:26 - is definitely in effect you could as a
04:28 - coding challenge I might say recreate
04:30 - this without WebGL and you probably
04:32 - could figure out like could you like
04:33 - maybe oscillate these these the vertices
04:37 - of this quad up and down to create this
04:39 - shape that looks like it's spinning but
04:41 - this is why WebGL exists so that we can
04:43 - just kind of do stuff without it so I
04:45 - can also now say like rotate Y and I can
04:48 - say you know just can like have it
04:50 - rotate maybe like slower along the y
04:52 - axis and we can see now here we go I've
04:55 - got this spinning plane and all we got
04:57 - to do is put general zod if we have the
05:00 - end of super bad three is that right
05:02 - flying off into space and I can add
05:05 - rotate Z angle times 1.2 and we can see
05:09 - now I have all three axes spinning so
05:13 - this is first step number one now
05:15 - another so so that's a 2d 2d plane there
05:19 - actually is a plane primitive in three
05:22 - so the question is we can use
05:24 - two-dimensional shapes that can live in
05:26 - a 3d world but we can also and just like
05:29 - they're these choosing perimeters arc
05:30 - ellipse line point quad rect triangle
05:33 - there are now this whole list of other
05:36 - 3d primitives plane which is a sexually
05:38 - what I've just done box sphere cylinder
05:40 - cone ellipsoid torus let's look at box
05:44 - so I'm gonna comment out this rectangle
05:48 - and I'm just gonna say box now what if I
05:49 - don't put anything in there probably I'm
05:52 - not gonna see anything I would think oh
05:55 - look it gave me some default you can
05:57 - kind of see that there's something 3d
05:59 - there right a little hard to totally see
06:02 - because there's no shading there's no
06:03 - lighting so the three-dimensional
06:05 - illusion becomes much more prominent
06:07 - once we've added more stuff but um one
06:10 - thing you can see here that I can do is
06:11 - with box if I say 200 now I have a box
06:15 - whose what are the dimensions of a box a
06:18 - rectangle has width and height a box has
06:20 - width height and depth so I can actually
06:23 - start to play with all those ten you
06:25 - know 150 and you can see now I have this
06:31 - spinning rectangular box that has a
06:34 - separate width height and depth so this
06:36 - is the basic
06:37 - working in 3d which is that you could
06:39 - just create ships now here's create
06:41 - three-dimensional primitives you can you
06:44 - you can color them and you can rotate
06:46 - them here's the thing though
06:47 - how would I move this throughout the
06:50 - three-dimensional space
06:51 - well rectangle right rectangle I give it
06:57 - an an X a Y and a width and a height box
07:01 - i gave it a width a height and the depth
07:03 - i think it's that order could I also
07:05 - give it like an x and a y like negative
07:08 - 50 10 no cannot draw stroke something's
07:13 - going on like crazy so that's just plain
07:16 - wrong the only way to position these
07:20 - three-dimensional primitives in
07:22 - three-dimensional space is with the
07:23 - translate function so in 2d you can use
07:25 - the translate function to move the
07:27 - origin point around and draw stuff
07:29 - relative to it
07:30 - same thing in 3d but the translate
07:32 - function is really required so if I did
07:34 - something like translate Mouse X Mouse y
07:43 - oops and you can see I'm kind of like
07:48 - whoa somehow it's sort of moving now
07:50 - here once again this is the thing I've
07:53 - really relinquished pinpoint accuracy of
07:57 - pixels first of all it's did I do I
08:00 - translate before I rotate it did I
08:02 - rotate before I translated what I really
08:05 - wanted to do was translate before I
08:07 - rotate at least for the effect that
08:08 - makes a big difference here because what
08:10 - I want to do is show you like I can but
08:12 - remember 0 0 is the center so if I
08:16 - really want to move it with the mouse
08:18 - I'd probably need to say translate Mouse
08:20 - X negative oh my god negative a with a
08:28 - little second if I'm true if 0 0 is the
08:35 - center and mouse X is at the center what
08:40 - do I want to do I just need to subtract
08:41 - that Center out so I need to say minus
08:43 - width divided by 2 minus height divided
08:46 - by 2 and I now have this 3d shape that
08:50 - I'm
08:50 - I'm moving around with the mouse but
08:53 - again 3d right
08:56 - I'm only translating along the X and the
08:59 - y axis something else I could do is I
09:02 - could say zero zero don't translate x
09:06 - and y but translate by the mouse along
09:09 - this use mouse X to translate along the
09:11 - z axis so now you can see as I move the
09:16 - mouse left and right
09:17 - the spinning rectangle is zooming in and
09:21 - out okay yay
09:26 - I'm taking way too long to go through
09:28 - all this stuff let's look at some of the
09:29 - other shapes and by the way coding
09:31 - trained viewers Simon Tiger create a
09:33 - nice little github gist that has a quick
09:36 - reference for all of these so let me
09:37 - look at one of these like I really like
09:39 - the Taurus Taurus is essentially a donut
09:43 - and it looks like a radius and a tube
09:45 - radius let's try that so a Taurus and
09:49 - let me give it a radius of 100 and a
09:52 - tube radius of 10 and go back to my
09:54 - sketch and we can see let me not zoom it
09:57 - anymore just rotate it and you can see
10:00 - there's my nice little three dimensional
10:02 - ring so the tube radius is there's
10:05 - almost like the thickness of the donut
10:07 - right so if I were to make this 50 you
10:11 - can see this is a much more delicious
10:13 - donut to eat because it's fatter around
10:16 - the butt and the actual radius itself is
10:20 - the radius of that circle so I could
10:22 - make that 50 with 10 you can see now I
10:24 - have a smaller one so I I could keep
10:26 - going through all of these there's cone
10:28 - I'd actually don't know let's go back to
10:30 - that list there's plain box sphere
10:33 - cylinder cone ellipsoid Taurus I
10:35 - encourage you to explore those on your
10:37 - own take a break see if you can there's
10:40 - actually a nice example on the p5.js
10:42 - website which I will go right now learn
10:46 - examples under web jeah 3d I'm gonna go
10:50 - to geometries so here we can very
10:52 - quickly see here or all of them let's
10:54 - see we can figure this out plane box
10:59 - cylinder sphere tourists come so what I
11:06 - would say it's like as an exercise see
11:08 - if you can recreate this position all of
11:10 - these shapes rotate them so you can get
11:12 - all these primitives to work you will
11:14 - notice here why are they there that's
11:16 - nice like rainbow color and that has to
11:18 - do with material so I think perhaps in
11:20 - the next video I want to quickly look at
11:22 - material and texture to see on how those
11:25 - work in 3d as well okay thanks for
11:27 - watching
