04:19 - let's do it
04:20 - [Music]
04:36 - [Music]
04:53 - foreign
05:03 - still checking my audio here I'm gonna
05:05 - try one more thing and I'm just going to
05:06 - leave it as is
05:08 - [Music]
05:25 - okay here we go
05:30 - [Music]
05:36 - hi I'm still here the train is departing
05:39 - I'm not ready I'm gonna switch the
05:41 - camera to being on me though
05:43 - uh
05:46 - what was loud
05:50 - um
05:55 - who is in the chat let's see uh oh boy
05:59 - uh
06:03 - let's see okay okay okay
06:07 - hi everybody oh this was a mistake
06:12 - My Life currently hi hi by the way I'm
06:15 - Dan uh you're watching a live stream of
06:17 - the coding train you're watching a
06:19 - completely unhinged unready person on
06:22 - the internet who just happened to turn
06:25 - on this whole streaming setup but is not
06:29 - at all uh ready the train whistle was
06:33 - loud I don't know what you were even
06:34 - hearing
06:36 - where did that come from so I don't
06:40 - something is wrong with the audio setup
06:42 - I
06:44 - let's just let's just set the stage for
06:46 - a second why am I here I don't know why
06:49 - you're here to be perfectly honest
06:52 - as my phone is beeping
06:56 - now turn that off
06:59 - um you should probably turn this off
07:01 - right now because
07:03 - I really wanted to live stream because I
07:06 - wanted to make sure I got a live stream
07:07 - in before the end of September and this
07:09 - was the last day that I could possibly
07:11 - do it and I was busy with all sorts of
07:13 - things all day today and I didn't get
07:15 - into this room until about 10 minutes
07:18 - ago and I'm completely not ready from a
07:21 - technical setup standpoint from a mental
07:24 - and emotional standpoint but I'm here
07:27 - nonetheless
07:28 - um the main thing here and I'm glad that
07:31 - Daniel teffra is saying that I'm excited
07:33 - for the stream and that hexagon has a
07:36 - curiosity I've got at least I've got
07:38 - this extra laptop here with me with some
07:40 - different new stickers on it that uh I
07:43 - can watch the Youtube chat uh go by here
07:46 - so thanks for bearing with me
07:49 - um I've got a short list of things I
07:51 - want to cover you'll you might notice
07:53 - that the title of this stream was just
07:55 - choo choo because I have no idea what
07:57 - it's supposed to happen during it but
08:00 - um
08:01 - if you could just give me a minute here
08:03 - to get organized
08:05 - uh I think everything's going to be okay
08:08 - so I have a question
08:10 - uh in terms of the audio and
08:12 - uh hello from Norway I was about to go
08:15 - to bed but I guess it will wait no no go
08:17 - to bed go to bed sleep sleep is
08:19 - important and the recording of This will
08:21 - be in the morning what are you really
08:23 - missing I mean yeah
08:26 - you you do you decide but you know just
08:29 - just if you want my advice sleep is good
08:32 - um question is my audio
08:37 - good enough
08:39 - do you hear a very substantial Echo I'm
08:42 - wondering
08:43 - I'm streaming from a cathedral audio is
08:47 - five by five I don't know what that
08:49 - audio is good so um so all right so I
08:51 - think it's fine I so in this room where
08:54 - I am it's a pretty open space in a
08:56 - garage and I have all these sound
08:58 - blankets I never sound treated this room
09:00 - but I have these like sound blankets
09:02 - that I was hanging for a while to try to
09:04 - keep the echo down and then I started
09:06 - using this piece of software called uh
09:09 - Nvidia broadcast which has like
09:12 - in real time uh remove the echo from it
09:16 - uh and
09:19 - it doesn't seem to be working right now
09:20 - but everybody's saying the audio is fine
09:22 - some of an echo okay slight Echo
09:24 - slightly muffled
09:26 - it's definitely this microphone I'm
09:28 - tapping on it we're just gonna go with
09:31 - what it is
09:33 - I don't understand there was a different
09:35 - time on my life
09:38 - and I know I said this probably the last
09:39 - time I live streamed more I was able to
09:41 - manage all the different kinds of things
09:43 - that I'm working on in uh in a healthy
09:46 - and productive way
09:49 - now is not that time
09:52 - uh
09:54 - uh uh and um I I can't seem to get it
09:57 - together and I think a lot of the reason
09:58 - is because I have been working on and
10:01 - you have to bear with me for a second
10:02 - I'm just downloading some stuff here
10:04 - that I want to show you I have been
10:06 - working on a couple projects
10:10 - I just noticed I haven't been in this
10:12 - room because I haven't been live
10:14 - streaming or recording videos and the
10:16 - spiders have spun webs that are now
10:19 - around me that's so sad uh hold on I'm
10:22 - downloading some things that I want to
10:24 - hopefully show you
10:27 - um let's see if I got them
10:30 - um I have been working on a couple big
10:31 - projects
10:33 - one is actually complete and the other
10:36 - is on its way to being complete
10:38 - so I feel like I need to get those
10:40 - projects behind me and then I can return
10:42 - maybe back to more of the rhythm again
10:45 - of
10:46 - small coding Challenge videos and other
10:48 - tutorials I don't know I haven't been
10:50 - able to keep up but I thank you I I
10:52 - wanted to live stream because I need to
10:55 - talk about these projects that I'm
10:56 - working on check in with you folks and
10:58 - say hello to the YouTube community
11:01 - and that kind of stuff so
11:05 - um
11:06 - when my hand covered the mic
11:08 - the echo went with it ah Keith signed up
11:12 - as a lifetime nebula member well thank
11:15 - you for that support that's actually the
11:17 - first item on my agenda so let's talk
11:19 - about something that is coming out now
11:21 - that is out right now
11:24 - that you can watch on the stream
11:25 - platform called nebula but we'll be
11:28 - coming out in a week so let's see if
11:30 - these downloaded
11:31 - uh
11:34 - uh let's see if this works all right I'm
11:37 - gonna go over to here
11:40 - and
11:44 - oh my God he's gonna eat me
11:48 - uh this is a little teaser of a project
11:50 - I've been working on
11:53 - let's see uh now let's just see if the
11:55 - audio goes through so I'm going to mute
11:57 - my microphone
12:03 - the audio does not go through so here in
12:06 - real time let's I use this piece of
12:08 - software called loopback uh which this
12:10 - should do it if I turn that on I believe
12:13 - now
12:14 - to learn program yes okay
12:17 - here's a great thing that's going to
12:19 - happen right now because I'm a complete
12:20 - mess and disorganized I'm going to play
12:22 - you a little teaser video about my next
12:27 - YouTube video that's coming out that is
12:29 - over five hours long
12:31 - and I'm gonna talk about how you can
12:32 - watch it today right now if you want or
12:34 - you can wait till October 1st when we'll
12:36 - be on YouTube let's see all right so I
12:38 - need to get rid of myself although it'll
12:39 - be funny for me to uh so let's see I
12:42 - think if I uh get rid of myself over
12:44 - here
12:46 - I have a button for that don't I uh
12:49 - should say laptop here there I did it
12:51 - okay oh you can still hear me uh I saw
12:54 - this big like red thing happen hold on
12:58 - all right everything seems fine okay so
13:00 - let's see let's see if I can make this
13:02 - happen
13:10 - this is a disaster
13:13 - wait I don't want to be playing picture
13:15 - in picture what is going on okay
13:17 - full screen view I can't use a computer
13:20 - here we go
13:23 - you have no idea what it means to
13:26 - program
13:27 - have you ever wanted to learn
13:30 - programming do you have no idea what it
13:33 - means to program do you want to break
13:36 - free from the bonds of the tools that
13:38 - other people have made for you and learn
13:40 - to build your own software to make
13:43 - things with code one way that you can
13:45 - learn how to program not the only way
13:47 - not the only way you can or should but
13:49 - it's my favorite way and that's with
13:50 - something called processing I've divided
13:53 - it into different chapters organized
13:55 - with a table of contents it's a bunch of
13:58 - lessons all sequenced teaching you the
14:00 - fundamentals of computer science and
14:02 - programming with processing and at the
14:04 - end everything culminates with the mini
14:06 - project that I'll show you how to build
14:08 - that synthesizes all of the concepts
14:10 - from the series I can't wait to see what
14:13 - you learn what you make and what you
14:14 - think of this series
14:17 - um
14:38 - this is all going wrong
14:41 - okay
14:45 - okay let's try it let's so all right so
14:48 - what was that
14:49 - was a little teaser video about my new
14:52 - processing course so one of the things
14:54 - that I have always done for many years
14:55 - is uh teach beginners how to code so
14:58 - I've done that in all sorts of contexts
15:01 - um and I have a lot of video tutorials
15:04 - on this channel that start from no
15:06 - experience and hopefully build up so the
15:09 - original first videos I made and I'm
15:11 - going to show you some clips of them in
15:13 - from um that I made them I think in like
15:16 - 2012 or with a piece of software called
15:18 - processing and I have redone them all
15:21 - and let me show you a little clip about
15:24 - uh showing you a little difference
15:26 - between then and now
15:29 - wish I planned this better okay uh here
15:32 - let's see let's see if this works
15:44 - so I really was just asking myself the
15:46 - question should I remake those videos
15:48 - the quality wasn't so great although I
15:50 - did look much younger over 10 years ago
15:53 - but enough time has passed a lot has
15:56 - changed in the landscape of tools for
15:58 - learning to code processing most
16:00 - recently came out with version 4 which
16:03 - has many new and exciting features so I
16:05 - figure why not let's just do it all
16:08 - again
16:14 - okay so
16:17 - um you can see this is basically these
16:19 - are oh don't don't I don't want to hear
16:21 - the volume the the I want to scrub
16:22 - through this now just so I can talk
16:24 - about it let's turn the sound off
16:27 - so I can't believe this this is nuts
16:30 - this is me and I I don't actually know
16:32 - the exact date of this I'm pretty sure
16:33 - it was around 2012 drawing our Cartesian
16:37 - plane and explaining the x and y axis
16:41 - and how to draw shapes in a canvas in
16:45 - processing and now here I am doing it
16:47 - again and so I'm hoping that this new
16:51 - version of these tutorials I've learned
16:54 - a lot in the years since
16:56 - um it's a bit more streamlined it has a
16:57 - whole set of new examples and you might
16:59 - be wondering how can you watch it now
17:01 - how can you support this work that I'm
17:03 - doing
17:04 - um
17:05 - and I don't know if anybody who's
17:07 - actually watching this live stream
17:08 - happens to be a beginner or haven't
17:10 - learned to code before doesn't know what
17:12 - processing is is the actual target
17:14 - audience of this thing that I've made
17:16 - unlikely I would say but you might be
17:19 - people who know somebody who might want
17:21 - to learn to code that you might be able
17:22 - to recommend it to so let me talk about
17:24 - how you're going to find out more about
17:26 - this right now yeah okay I've got to go
17:29 - to a web browser here computer is not at
17:32 - all set up for this
17:36 - uh
17:38 - and let me
17:40 - make this chat window a little bit
17:42 - bigger so I can see I don't know if
17:43 - anybody is in the members Discord chat
17:46 - well I got it I got it I got it Chrome I
17:48 - understand what's going on here so let's
17:50 - go to uh github.com codingtrain
17:54 - um and let's take a look to see if we
17:56 - can find what I'm looking for
17:59 - uh all right so let's look for oh I
18:03 - should pin this one but I'm just going
18:05 - to go to it here so this is the GitHub
18:09 - repo for the creative coding processing
18:12 - full course and I have to give a big
18:13 - shout out to Melissa Rodriguez who did I
18:17 - call her uh producer researcher
18:21 - organizer reminder amazing amazing
18:25 - person uh creative coding uh artist who
18:28 - helped me organize and create a lot of
18:30 - these code examples and a lot of the
18:32 - materials that are in the course itself
18:34 - you can see the outline uh here in this
18:37 - page of the full thing with some time
18:39 - codes so uh there's a there's a
18:42 - introduction that I start with where I
18:44 - talk a bit about my history and the
18:45 - history of processing and you can see
18:47 - all the various things that I'm showing
18:50 - are all linked here on this page as well
18:53 - um then the uh video opens with teaching
18:57 - about how to learn to draw with code and
19:01 - the various reference Pages the
19:03 - different examples I'm going to run
19:05 - through a bunch of these right now I
19:06 - look at program flow I look at variables
19:10 - conditionals Loops arrays functions
19:15 - classes and objects at the four hour
19:17 - mark
19:18 - and then at the end I essentially do a
19:22 - little mini coding challenge at the end
19:23 - to build this confetti project a little
19:26 - bit of a conclusion with other resources
19:28 - and references for things that you might
19:31 - go further and node head in the chat
19:33 - appropriately says ew Java and I say
19:39 - Java I actually I I I don't know how
19:42 - strange this is but I do really enjoy
19:44 - the Java programming language
19:46 - um one of the one of the things about
19:48 - processing though is even with all the
19:50 - quirks and difficulties of the Java
19:52 - programming language itself processing
19:54 - is this wonderful environment and
19:56 - ecosystem that hides obscures a lot of
19:59 - the painful parts of java and allows you
20:01 - really to creatively make stuff with
20:04 - code so I'm gonna I'm gonna pull up a
20:06 - bunch of these examples but um what I'll
20:09 - mention here right now is uh so one hey
20:13 - this is coming it will be out on October
20:16 - 1st on the channel the YouTube channel
20:18 - it um but and you can see here's Melissa
20:21 - who's uh just a shout out Melissa who
20:23 - did all this work
20:24 - um but uh one of the ways that I am
20:27 - funding this project and this work is
20:30 - through
20:31 - um uh releasing it early on nebula so
20:35 - there uh last time I did a live stream I
20:37 - talked about different ways that people
20:38 - can support the coding train through
20:39 - YouTube memberships and GitHub
20:40 - sponsorship and that and the like but um
20:43 - uh currently I am part of this wonderful
20:47 - streaming service called nebula if you
20:49 - go to
20:50 - go.nebula.tv codingtrain
20:55 - um this uh oh look and my new header
20:57 - image which is something I'm going to
20:58 - talk about here the new logo
21:00 - um this is a uh this is the link that
21:04 - you want to look for
21:06 - um and the video is currently on the
21:09 - processing course is currently on nebula
21:11 - right now uh if you click here you're
21:13 - gonna it's gonna take me to what the
21:15 - different options are so this is a
21:17 - little bit of an odd thing this is a
21:19 - special promotion only for September
21:22 - so you can actually buy a lifetime
21:25 - membership to nebula you might be
21:26 - wondering like what the heck what so a
21:28 - couple people left this comment for me
21:30 - which was oh I don't want another
21:32 - service I have to subscribe to I just
21:34 - want to buy the class well guess what
21:36 - essentially this is your way of buying
21:39 - the class uh I mean you can also watch
21:41 - it for free when it comes out on YouTube
21:42 - but um what um this is uh this is this
21:47 - is a one-time only payment you never
21:48 - have to think about the subscription
21:49 - service again you just have it forever
21:51 - one of the reasons why I really love
21:53 - nebula is because it is a incredibly
21:57 - incredible curated collection of
22:00 - YouTubers that I regularly watch and a
22:03 - lot of them have exclusive and original
22:05 - content that is on nebula itself let me
22:08 - see if I can pull up the
22:12 - um
22:13 - some of the originals here so if I go to
22:16 - nebula.tv just go to here and if I go to
22:19 - videos ah yes so and then I go to
22:22 - Originals let's take a look so this is
22:24 - what I'm most impressed with about
22:26 - nebula
22:28 - um these original projects
22:30 - um for example I mean video SAS like
22:33 - Lindsay Ellis or on you on our nebula
22:36 - I'm trying to look there was this
22:37 - project called the prince that was
22:38 - amazing oh I love these uh City
22:42 - beautiful videos
22:44 - are really fantastic so if you like
22:47 - eposvox has an original I really would
22:50 - like to make one of these I don't know
22:52 - what it should be I'm open to your ideas
22:55 - but um there are also uh these wonderful
22:59 - classes that are on nebula that are
23:01 - exclusive to the platform we can kind of
23:04 - like scroll through oh turn data into
23:07 - stories I need to watch that one I have
23:09 - one of these I don't think I'll pop out
23:10 - up here if you're interested in music
23:13 - in all sorts of other kinds of topics
23:16 - especially about video production and
23:18 - animation there's a lot of really great
23:20 - stuff on here
23:21 - uh Patrick Williams I'm a big fan of has
23:25 - a wonderful course how to make a movie I
23:27 - need to wear a beret more in mind so
23:30 - anyway so nebula is this great platform
23:32 - um the uh the you can read about I would
23:36 - suggest you read this post from the CEO
23:39 - about uh lifetime memberships
23:43 - um the sort of reason for this program
23:45 - it is a way for the platform to increase
23:50 - the budget of nebula originals and it is
23:54 - also so um by the way you know it's all
23:57 - explicitly outlined here about one-third
23:59 - of the money goes to the Creator whose
24:00 - code you used
24:02 - um and more about
24:04 - um the the originals and different
24:05 - things that the streaming platform is
24:07 - trying to work on improving so all of
24:10 - that is to say that uh if you are
24:13 - interested in supporting the coding
24:15 - train if you want to watch my new course
24:17 - right now before it comes to YouTube you
24:20 - can go to this URL I pin I I don't think
24:23 - I pinned it but go.net I'll pin it in
24:25 - the chat
24:27 - go.nebula.tv codingtrain you can sign up
24:30 - for a monthly subscription an annual
24:31 - subscription or a lifetime one to be
24:34 - clear the lifetime subscription is not
24:37 - your best value right if you're looking
24:40 - for the best value that would be just
24:42 - buying an annual subscription and of
24:44 - course a monthly one is a nice thing to
24:46 - do if you just want to sort of try it
24:47 - for a month and see but the lifetime
24:49 - subscription is the best way to support
24:52 - the nebula platform and independent
24:54 - create outside of you know the ad
24:57 - supported model that is YouTube and me
25:00 - in particular so anyway I didn't mean to
25:02 - belabor that so much that's kind of one
25:04 - of the main reasons I'm doing a live
25:06 - stream today I'm starting to make turn
25:07 - this into what is essentially an ad but
25:09 - I've worked well I I think I started
25:12 - this new processing course
25:14 - uh in January of 2023 so I think I'm
25:18 - about eight months it took me about
25:19 - eight months to finish it in terms of
25:20 - all the recording compiling all the
25:22 - examples all the post-production so I'm
25:25 - very excited for it to finally be on
25:27 - YouTube and see how uh what new audience
25:31 - might find it what people might create
25:32 - through code with it
25:34 - um but I wanted to make sure I took the
25:36 - time to tell the core audience here in
25:38 - the live stream about how it is
25:40 - available right now on nebula and how
25:43 - you can sign up today and go and watch
25:46 - it great if you have questions about
25:48 - that I'm happy to take them into the
25:50 - chat I think I will move from
25:53 - uh focusing on the this to show you a
25:56 - little bit more about what's in the
25:58 - course
25:59 - all right so couple things that let's
26:01 - let's take a look at so one is let's
26:03 - download uh let's clone this repo
26:06 - let's see here again I have no idea I
26:09 - haven't like used this computer anytime
26:11 - recently it's like remind me later for
26:13 - all these updates let's just clone this
26:16 - to the desktop
26:18 - um
26:19 - if you're if you're a new uh to get and
26:23 - GitHub and all these things I might
26:24 - suggest just if you want to try out all
26:26 - these examples just downloading the zip
26:28 - file
26:30 - uh
26:31 - uh and but I'm gonna do it this way and
26:34 - now I can uh find the folder hopefully
26:36 - on my desktop
26:39 - and go here whoops that's not the right
26:41 - place I want to go to I'm going to go
26:43 - here okay so this by the way for if and
26:47 - when you decide you want to watch the
26:50 - course and code along with it every
26:53 - there there's essentially 10 chapters I
26:54 - wish I had my learning processing book
26:56 - but
26:58 - just to tell you just to complete the
27:01 - full story about this
27:03 - I have this book whoa 9.99 look at that
27:07 - what a deal
27:08 - um so uh it the second edition which is
27:12 - uh published by elsevier I'm sure you
27:13 - could find this on wherever books are
27:15 - sold
27:16 - um but this is a book that the second
27:19 - edition came out in 2015 I believe the
27:23 - first edition was
27:25 - I want to say like 2008 so that's the
27:28 - first time I ever tried to tell the full
27:31 - story of learning the code with
27:32 - processing was through this book I did
27:35 - an updated version of it in 2015. I
27:38 - don't I never I don't think it makes
27:40 - sense right now to do another updated
27:42 - version of the print book but the video
27:44 - course the five hour video course is
27:46 - essentially this or at least maybe most
27:49 - of the book itself
27:50 - um so I'm mostly moving towards
27:52 - producing my educational content through
27:55 - video right now than writing although my
27:57 - other project I'm going to talk about
27:58 - nature of code is not that so that's
28:00 - kind of where a lot of this stems from
28:03 - so and you can essentially this outline
28:06 - with all these examples are the newest
28:09 - version of those learn to code examples
28:10 - with processing that I've made let's
28:12 - open up some of them to take a look so I
28:14 - don't know what what interests people
28:16 - uh Barney codes is in the chat everybody
28:20 - should check out Barney's YouTube
28:21 - channel 30 minute course on shaders
28:25 - yeah can't imagine how long it took a
28:27 - five hour course yeah well the funny
28:29 - thing is the original videos I made were
28:32 - just recorded extemporaneously like I
28:34 - just
28:35 - turned on the recording and talked and
28:38 - made some examples and hit stop and then
28:40 - uploaded them they took me the amount of
28:42 - time it took me to make the original
28:43 - videos was the amount of time it takes
28:45 - you to watch them I mean I'm not
28:47 - factoring in the mental preparation in
28:50 - years of learning this stuff before I
28:51 - just turned on the recording but this
28:54 - for better or worse this five hour
28:56 - course has is more somewhat more
29:00 - thoughtfully made it's still kind of me
29:02 - just talking but it's edited so it moves
29:05 - a bit faster there's uh some
29:07 - post-production so additional examples
29:08 - and reference materials are just kind of
29:11 - shown next to me that I didn't have at
29:13 - the moment of recording so I'd be
29:15 - curious I don't know how to a B test
29:17 - this properly but have somebody watch
29:19 - the original ones have somebody watch
29:21 - the new ones what's their experience uh
29:23 - which one's better which one's worse
29:25 - okay
29:26 - um
29:27 - so let's just look I don't know let's
29:29 - look at some of these examples here
29:31 - let's see what's in there let's look at
29:32 - drawing and let's look at a spaceship
29:36 - color
29:37 - I don't know what this one is whoa that
29:39 - is some big oh that's just because I
29:40 - zoomed in so you can see by the way one
29:42 - of the things is I just noticed I
29:44 - remembered I should probably take these
29:45 - out a lot of the examples will have this
29:47 - line of code that says pixel density 2
29:50 - in it that is a way of rendering what is
29:53 - essentially double
29:55 - quadruple it's four pixels for every one
29:58 - because it's a anyway for like high for
30:01 - high density displays like a Mac retina
30:05 - or other high density uh uh displays the
30:09 - actual pixel dimensions versus the
30:11 - number of pixels that are being shoved
30:12 - into your eyes it's different and I for
30:15 - capturing them I wanted to have the
30:17 - extra density of pixels the extra
30:19 - resolution but for right now that
30:20 - actually shouldn't be in there let's
30:21 - take a look at this spaceship
30:23 - so yes
30:25 - there it is if you want to learn to make
30:27 - spaceships like this
30:28 - that is though that's where the course
30:30 - starts in terms of drawing stuff with
30:33 - code
30:34 - moving along
30:36 - um it moves from there to looking at
30:38 - animation animation oh you know what I
30:41 - just realized
30:44 - I think I don't know if this is true no
30:48 - this can't be true is it true that it's
30:50 - the extra examples that are in here but
30:52 - the actual examples are not I have to
30:54 - double check to make sure I have all the
30:56 - materials here so but you can start you
30:59 - could see these are all these I'm just
31:00 - going to skip ahead and the and go to
31:01 - the end and look at the very last
31:04 - example
31:06 - that you learn if you want to learn like
31:08 - what brings everything together at the
31:10 - very very end of the video uh it is
31:13 - making amazing uh confetti explode with
31:17 - color and rotate and spin in beautiful
31:20 - ways I actually don't cover translate
31:22 - and rotate specifically in the course
31:24 - but that's a add-on towards the end
31:27 - there but sort of building up to this
31:30 - idea of object-oriented programming and
31:32 - how to create a system out of code so
31:35 - that's the full course I encourage you
31:38 - to take a look at the examples I'm going
31:40 - to double check to make sure everything
31:41 - is there
31:43 - and check out the GitHub repo which has
31:48 - all of the information if you want to
31:50 - watch it now you can
31:53 - um
31:54 - find the link here to nebula now
31:57 - uh one thing that I do want to say is
32:00 - also in addition I have at the moment
32:03 - this
32:04 - um Reddit post so if you want to add you
32:07 - could obviously join the coding trade
32:09 - Discord
32:10 - um but if you want to uh chat or ask
32:12 - questions
32:14 - um this Reddit thread uh as part of the
32:17 - um nebulous subreddit is where you can
32:19 - do that I would encourage you to come
32:21 - and say hello in there because it's
32:23 - another place to say hello I'm following
32:25 - this very closely because oh I forgot
32:28 - why the most important thing this is
32:30 - here's an important reason why I need
32:32 - some people to watch the thing on nebula
32:34 - so one of the wonderful things about the
32:38 - nebula platform being owned and operated
32:40 - essentially by a collect a group of
32:43 - creators is they have a lot of agency in
32:45 - terms of the platform and if there's a
32:47 - mistake in a video I can correct it and
32:48 - re-upload the file but that is not
32:50 - something that I can easily do on
32:52 - YouTube well it's not something you can
32:53 - do it all on YouTube so one of the
32:55 - reasons also for having this pre-release
32:58 - on the nebula platform is that I could
33:01 - get a little feedback if there are any
33:02 - mistakes or things that I want to tweak
33:03 - or fix before the final version comes
33:07 - out
33:08 - um I would love to hear so to be honest
33:10 - now I haven't gotten one single which
33:13 - correction which could mean that the
33:15 - whole thing is just perfect but I'm
33:16 - guessing
33:18 - um maybe people just don't know that
33:19 - they could tell me or that not that many
33:21 - people have seen it yet but I've got
33:22 - about a week left before I plan to
33:26 - release it on YouTube and that is kind
33:28 - of you know once once I have errors or
33:30 - things I need to fix they just will
33:31 - essentially go in the description so if
33:33 - you are interested and able to and end
33:37 - up watching this on nebula and you
33:40 - notice anything please reach out to me
33:42 - the Reddit post uh social media
33:46 - the coding train Discord all of those
33:48 - places you can go to speaking of which
33:50 - let me just make sure
33:53 - I'm just going to take a peek into the
33:55 - coding train Discord here to see if
33:57 - there are any important messages I am
34:00 - now
34:00 - monitoring the chat that has Simon in it
34:03 - the sound is found oh the train
34:05 - whistle's in the intro that's what's
34:07 - loud
34:08 - and uh yeah I'm monitoring the Discord
34:11 - chat now uh to uh to for the members who
34:14 - are there in that as well okay so let me
34:17 - see if I can keep that open and the
34:20 - YouTube chat
34:22 - um have both of them
34:24 - oh it's so hard to manage so many
34:27 - screens
34:29 - uh minimizing some things don't worry
34:31 - any minute now oh my God are you serious
34:34 - okay great okay this is good this is
34:36 - good I'm good now I'm good now
34:41 - all right what else ah one more thing
34:44 - about this
34:46 - let's go to thecodingtrain.com
34:51 - let's take a look at oh well actually
34:53 - let's go to the GitHub so
34:56 - this is the coding Train website if you
34:58 - haven't seen it before now you see it
35:02 - I'm gonna go over to
35:05 - uh the coding train GitHub I'm gonna and
35:08 - this is I'm gonna look at the pull
35:10 - requests and boy there's a lot of
35:12 - submissions here that I need to take a
35:13 - look at and merge
35:15 - um which maybe I could do some of that
35:16 - today but let's look at this one for a
35:19 - second let's see if the preview is still
35:20 - built great
35:22 - so when the video is on YouTube
35:27 - um
35:29 - here on this page you will also find it
35:33 - here so every
35:36 - um video well not everybody most of the
35:38 - videos that are on the channel have an
35:40 - Associated page on the codingtrain
35:43 - website with all of the relevant
35:45 - metadata for that video looking for a
35:47 - code example looking for a link to
35:49 - something I reference in the video it's
35:51 - all here did you make a project that
35:53 - you're excited about related to a video
35:55 - I made there's a passenger showcase a
35:57 - place for you to submit that I have
35:59 - talked about that many times on many
36:02 - streams I could again now and maybe I
36:04 - will but that's not why I'm here
36:06 - one of the things that I also that I
36:08 - have on the site are what's known as
36:11 - tracks a track is essentially a sequence
36:13 - course probably what I had typically
36:16 - Point people towards when they are first
36:19 - learning creative coding would be this
36:21 - track code programming with p5.js you'll
36:24 - notice it has track stops those are the
36:27 - individual videos
36:30 - um that some of these are really quite
36:32 - old for each of the different concepts
36:34 - that then have you know the code in them
36:37 - a description maybe a um a showcase
36:40 - project
36:41 - so this particular processing course
36:44 - this new track
36:46 - if I can get back to the tracks is
36:49 - different
36:50 - in that it is one single video it's not
36:54 - there yet doesn't exist on YouTube yet
36:55 - so this is very much of a placeholder
36:58 - the website was not designed with this
37:01 - in mind the website was designed with
37:03 - the idea of the courses being sequence
37:06 - tutorials and also for those of you who
37:09 - might be more familiar with my
37:10 - challenges uh this sort of collection of
37:12 - these independent specific project
37:15 - videos that you can go and watch and
37:18 - enjoy and create your own versions of
37:19 - whenever you might like to so at the
37:22 - moment thank you to um
37:25 - uh
37:26 - uh uh dipom sen who I know is probably
37:29 - sleeping right now because it is at the
37:31 - middle of the night in their time zone
37:33 - but created a sort of Band-Aid version
37:37 - of a track page for this single video
37:40 - which will just time code the various
37:43 - sections and
37:45 - um and include the metadata here so I
37:47 - haven't figured out the best way to
37:48 - organize that but um
37:51 - when if and when you watch this course
37:54 - and if you make something from watching
37:57 - it you will be able to submit it here to
37:59 - the passenger showcase so I wanted to
38:01 - highlight that I want to encourage
38:02 - anybody to plan to do that
38:07 - um yeah so var19 makes a sort of funny
38:10 - joke there in the chat saying ah yes
38:12 - uh did I pin this already oh I did pin
38:15 - it okay paid beta testing that's great
38:17 - oh wait the testers are the ones paying
38:20 - I know I know I know I know so here's
38:23 - the thing
38:23 - if you really feel like you want to
38:26 - watch it to see if I have any errors and
38:29 - it's not accessible to you because of
38:31 - the way I'm releasing it on nebula just
38:33 - come on to the coding train Discord say
38:35 - at schiffman tag me with this uh request
38:38 - I will think about a way to see if I can
38:41 - figure out a way for you to be able to
38:43 - help watch it and provide any feedback
38:45 - so I by no means am I hoping to lock
38:48 - people out of this process
38:51 - um just it's the way that I'm have set
38:53 - things up to go okay
38:55 - yes Oktoberfest
38:59 - as chat is reminding me all right so I
39:01 - think I have now said everything that I
39:04 - need to say about the new processing
39:07 - course that's come that's already out on
39:10 - nebula pinned chat message you want to
39:12 - watch it right now and we'll be out on
39:15 - YouTube soon enough uh soon so I think
39:19 - I've any other questions about that
39:20 - please uh say them in the chat and maybe
39:23 - I will see them or join the coding train
39:25 - Discord uh which you can just go to
39:27 - thecodingtrade.com Discord it'll take
39:30 - you right into it and you can tag me in
39:32 - there I've been a bit more active in
39:35 - some of the in in the channels there the
39:36 - last couple weeks trying to answer
39:37 - people's questions
39:39 - okay
39:41 - um I fear that I have a new mention
39:42 - already
39:44 - um so I will take a look at that after I
39:47 - finish with this live stream which by
39:49 - the way I'm not going to be here that
39:50 - long this was kind of just like a check
39:52 - in say hello and announce and update you
39:55 - on some projects
39:57 - all right what else do I need to talk
39:59 - about I made an agenda and I put it in
40:02 - the description of this video and
40:04 - nowhere right now do I have the
40:06 - description of this video available for
40:09 - me to look at so I'm gonna just remember
40:11 - things that I want to talk about and
40:13 - then you will look at it maybe and
40:15 - remind me in the chat
40:17 - um it's not about current theme but do
40:18 - you plan to release new coding
40:20 - challenges yes
40:22 - is yes yes yes and yes uh is processing
40:26 - just for learning
40:29 - um processing is not just for learning
40:31 - processing is an incredible platform
40:33 - that you can use for Learning and
40:36 - uh also build uh projects on from a
40:39 - variety of different you know for a
40:41 - variety of different contexts and scales
40:42 - uh and many uh artists use it many
40:46 - creative agencies use it many schools
40:48 - use it and you can also work with its
40:52 - sibling project p5.js which is a
40:57 - creative coding library for JavaScript
40:59 - which would allow you to run things like
41:02 - you might do in processing right in the
41:03 - browser
41:05 - um so in terms of the um
41:08 - uh thanks for the agenda Matthew nature
41:11 - of code updates Oktoberfest new logo
41:13 - great okay
41:15 - um I think I remembered all those things
41:16 - in terms of the challenges I've got to
41:18 - get back into the rhythm of doing them
41:20 - again and I have a list of things to get
41:22 - to I just it's like the walls are
41:24 - closing in on me these days with the
41:26 - various things that I'm working on and
41:28 - the very very busy teaching semester
41:30 - this semester so I'm struggling to find
41:32 - the time to dedicate to the coding train
41:34 - that I have in the past and that I want
41:36 - to but the coding challenge is not the
41:38 - coding challenges is a
41:40 - lifetime project that I hope to get more
41:43 - going with that I have yet to complete
41:45 - so stay tuned all right where should I
41:48 - go next
41:49 - let's talk about
41:52 - uh some quick okay so I'm going to write
41:54 - this list down I want to talk about
41:55 - nature of code
41:57 - where I am with that project I want to
41:59 - talk about hacktoberfest
42:02 - which is coming up
42:04 - and that relates to the showcases and
42:06 - maybe we'll look at some showcase
42:07 - projects and then I want to talk about
42:09 - the coding train logo and ways that you
42:14 - can make your own variations of it
42:17 - okay
42:20 - um
42:23 - I know anybody anybody out there feel
42:25 - like they want to hear about one of
42:26 - those topics first let's go check in on
42:29 - the nature of code
42:31 - um
42:34 - all right so
42:37 - speaking of projects that I've been
42:38 - working on for well over 10 years
42:41 - the nature of code book is one of them
42:44 - and I know that I'm about to repeat some
42:46 - things that I've done on previous live
42:48 - streams but I can really tell from this
42:49 - chat
42:51 - uh that there's a lot of new names here
42:53 - so let's let's let's let's recap in a
42:56 - sort of hopefully a succinct and
42:58 - efficient way
43:00 - if you knew nothing and just happened to
43:02 - search for nature of code this is
43:04 - probably where you would end up
43:06 - this is the website for the version of
43:09 - the book that was published to be using
43:11 - this year a lot in 2012.
43:14 - you could actually click and buy the
43:16 - print version please do not do that you
43:19 - could also uh click here uh you you know
43:22 - you could also slide these down to zero
43:24 - and click here to download uh bundle
43:27 - which includes PDF ePub and Kindle
43:31 - formats the Epub and Kindle formats if
43:33 - I'm being honest I didn't do such a
43:35 - great job with them they're kind of
43:37 - they're kind of so the PDF though I can
43:39 - stand behind but all of this
43:40 - is old and you shouldn't look at it I
43:43 - mean you can look at it I'm sorry
43:44 - there's there's there's something there
43:46 - that's still meaningful because it is a
43:49 - doc it is a thing
43:51 - that came out in the world in 2012
43:53 - that's important to
43:55 - look back on and think about
43:58 - but if you are looking for the latest
44:00 - and most up-to-date
44:02 - version of this the ideas that started
44:05 - in this particular book then this is not
44:08 - the place for you the place for you on
44:11 - some level is this and I'm going to at
44:13 - the moment actually just trigger a quick
44:17 - uh GitHub action
44:23 - where do I run this
44:27 - did the interface change
44:29 - or is it just because it's not there
44:32 - what's going on here where's the button
44:35 - for running the action oh I'm not signed
44:37 - in I'm like what's going on here it's
44:39 - because I'm not signed in okay sorry
44:40 - everybody oh
44:42 - speaking of being unprepared
44:46 - at least the password is kind of saved
44:48 - in there I'm gonna have to two factor in
44:50 - though give me a moment here Talk
44:52 - Amongst yourselves
44:54 - I am reading the comments while I can
44:57 - steal away a moment
44:59 - [Music]
45:01 - I don't really care that you're seeing
45:02 - this right now it will expire before you
45:04 - can hack into my account okay
45:06 - let's go to the actions this takes a
45:09 - little while so that's why I wanted to
45:10 - run this run workflow run workflow okay
45:15 - so this is the repo for the new version
45:19 - of the book now
45:21 - this is actually
45:23 - your
45:25 - um
45:26 - the the sorry the build system for the
45:28 - new version of the book the content of
45:30 - the book is actually in this repo but
45:32 - where the content is being worked on is
45:35 - not in this repo it's actually being
45:37 - worked on in a collection of notion
45:39 - documents and what I just did there very
45:42 - quickly was I ran this GitHub action
45:45 - which connects to the notion API by the
45:48 - way I'd really love to do a whole video
45:51 - it often likes to time out so let's try
45:54 - running it again this is going it's
45:57 - going remarkably well uh it is
46:02 - um it is an action that uses the notion
46:05 - API to go and collect all of the
46:08 - material that I've written
46:10 - reformat repackage it and bring it into
46:13 - this repo so that it can then be built
46:16 - and published to a website
46:21 - I wonder if there's actually uh it often
46:24 - times out but I wonder if there's
46:26 - something else going on no request a
46:28 - notion API failed
46:30 - with status 502 does anybody know what
46:32 - 502 is notion client maybe then is the
46:36 - API just down
46:39 - that's probably rerunning the job
46:42 - I'm gonna try it one more time
46:44 - this is something I will certainly look
46:46 - at later on my own time figure out why
46:48 - this isn't working so
46:50 - that process would bring in all of the
46:55 - written content
46:56 - to these HTML files it brings in all of
47:00 - the code examples to these uh other
47:04 - collections of JavaScript and HTML files
47:08 - and it also brings in
47:11 - all of these images which are all of
47:14 - these uh screenshots and various
47:16 - illustrations and things that are in
47:18 - notion and then all of that goes to
47:23 - if I go back here
47:26 - bad Gateway server error response
47:28 - server-wise get received an invalid
47:30 - response from the Upstream server so to
47:32 - look and see what that is that's what
47:34 - error 502 is someone's telling me in the
47:35 - chat to here
47:37 - uh this does this actually go somewhere
47:40 - it does now excellent okay so here is
47:42 - the most recent version of the book in
47:45 - progress why my desk is really quite
47:46 - high today
47:48 - um
47:49 - and my green screen is all a mess but
47:51 - whatever I'm just I'm doing my best here
47:53 - my best is quite inadequate these days
47:56 - on so many levels just trying all that I
47:59 - can do and uh so this is what you should
48:01 - look at now
48:02 - uh what's exciting about where I am with
48:05 - the project is all of the chapters have
48:07 - been drafted even if I go here into whoa
48:13 - this is a I have a formatting error
48:15 - that's fine though uh even if I go to
48:17 - this very last chapter it is now written
48:19 - the thing about it is there's a lot of
48:21 - placeholder stuff in here uh the
48:23 - illustrations aren't finished this is
48:25 - what they ask you to look for you can
48:27 - see there's some sort of like notes in
48:28 - there like what do you think about
48:29 - having uh what do you think about having
48:31 - a little illustration here so
48:33 - um just be aware this is an in-progress
48:36 - draft but you can read it now if you
48:38 - notice things that are wrong mistakes
48:40 - you can file them as issues in the
48:42 - GitHub repo and if you want to support
48:45 - this project there are a few things you
48:48 - can do
48:49 - one is you could go to this sponsor
48:51 - button right here and you can sponsor uh
48:54 - the coding terrain through uh you know
48:57 - GitHub sponsorship patreon uh YouTube
49:00 - membership and also here's the nebula
49:02 - link
49:03 - and then
49:05 - um you can also
49:09 - um pre-order the physical book
49:11 - so I think right here if I click on this
49:14 - link
49:15 - um again the book will be Creative
49:17 - Commons licensed and available for free
49:19 - online but if you want to have the
49:22 - physical version
49:24 - um I'm I'm thrilled to be working with
49:27 - no starch press who will be work
49:28 - Printing and distributing all of that
49:30 - and you can pre-order it right now can
49:32 - you do the Halloween stream
49:35 - that is such a good idea no flap
49:39 - um I would love to do a Halloween stream
49:41 - I don't know how or when to do that but
49:45 - um I mean I should do it on Halloween
49:48 - I'm never going to remember this right
49:50 - now so let's uh people in the Discord
49:52 - and on the internet on social media just
49:54 - bug me around mid-october actually why
49:57 - don't you wait can you wait till after
49:59 - like October 16th or 17th maybe after
50:02 - October 20th wait till after October
50:04 - 20th and start bugging me about doing a
50:05 - Halloween stream okay good we got it yes
50:08 - okay deal uh you love the costume that
50:11 - was so long ago I used to do such silly
50:13 - things like that every okay so Richard
50:15 - Gill asks everything in P5 and thank you
50:18 - Richard Gill for supporting through
50:19 - membership everything in uh nature of
50:23 - code is it p5.js so correct this version
50:27 - of the book like if I just go to chapter
50:29 - two for example
50:30 - and start scrolling through let's
50:32 - actually go to like chapter seven
50:34 - because it's uh maybe a little more
50:35 - interesting to see something a little
50:36 - further in
50:38 - um there's like a weird bug here where
50:40 - these images are cut off I don't know
50:41 - what's going on there
50:43 - so many things are going wrong today but
50:45 - if I scroll down to where I get to
50:46 - finally one of the examples here it is
50:48 - so when I get to one of the examples
50:50 - this is an example oh this is the next
50:52 - coding challenge I'm going to do too
50:53 - which is the Wolfram Elementary CA what
50:56 - you'll notice in the book I'm obviously
50:58 - writing and describing about the
51:00 - concepts and how I'm writing the code
51:02 - then there is an embedded example that I
51:05 - can reset I can pause reset Etc
51:09 - um got a code snippet here and then I
51:11 - can click right here and it will open a
51:13 - new window and now I've got that code
51:15 - example right here in the P5 web editor
51:18 - if I want to experiment with it so yes
51:20 - the reason why I'm using the main reason
51:22 - I'm using p5.js for this iteration of
51:25 - the book is to be able to have all of
51:27 - the examples easily Run online embedded
51:30 - inside the book
51:31 - it is my intention it is my plan and I
51:34 - love that Robert Richard are just saying
51:36 - hello to each other in the chat what a
51:37 - wonderful thing it is my plan to Port
51:41 - all of the examples to processing as
51:43 - well most of them already are so I will
51:45 - be uh you know I gotta finish a lot of
51:47 - the details I need to get done but the
51:49 - idea like the materials that would be
51:52 - part of the book's materials would
51:53 - include processing and p5.js version of
51:56 - the examples and then I do expect people
51:58 - will report them to a lot of other
51:59 - environments as well I have a GitHub a
52:03 - document that's actually keeping track
52:04 - of a list of ton of ports that people
52:05 - have done over the years of the earlier
52:07 - verses of the examples
52:09 - okay
52:11 - um so
52:12 - um so yeah so that's what's happening
52:14 - with nature of code book uh I welcome
52:17 - your uh participation and enthusiasm and
52:21 - encouragement for this project in any
52:23 - way that you can stay tuned the things
52:26 - that I have left to do before it's
52:28 - really done
52:30 - I need to write the introduction the
52:32 - acknowledgments I'm just doing this is
52:33 - more for me right now uh there's going
52:35 - to be an appendix about how to draw make
52:37 - creatures thank you to Zana marshes
52:39 - doing all the illustrations for this
52:41 - it's gonna be appendix a couple of
52:43 - appendix in the book that I need to
52:45 - finish uh in collaboration with her
52:49 - um there's a lot of illustrations that
52:51 - haven't been finished
52:53 - got to finish the cover or think about
52:56 - the cover
52:57 - some stuff for the interior a lot of
52:59 - things there's a long to-do list
53:02 - uh I need to close all seven 75 of these
53:05 - issues
53:06 - so there's a lot of stuff uh that needs
53:09 - to be done but that's that's kind of
53:11 - where I am uh and and I would say this
53:13 - to me is the biggest roadblock right now
53:17 - to me really working on the coding train
53:21 - because
53:23 - this has to get done it's got a deadline
53:25 - I have commitments to it in terms of
53:28 - with the publisher and every free moment
53:31 - that I have that's not something that I
53:34 - am doing with my family or for my
53:36 - students at NYU usually that's where I
53:39 - would turn to the coding train and these
53:42 - days that's where I turn to the nature
53:43 - of code book
53:44 - so that's the way things are going right
53:46 - now
53:48 - um okay
53:51 - I talked about nature of code
53:53 - let's talk about hacktoberfest and maybe
53:57 - there's even something related to the
53:59 - coding trade logo that we could
54:01 - work into that so hacktoberfest what is
54:05 - it this is no
54:06 - uh let me let me take a look let's see
54:09 - there I I forget who runs it I think
54:11 - it's is it by GitHub itself is it okay
54:14 - so 10th year oh it's presented by
54:16 - digital ocean
54:18 - Ila and app right so I have no official
54:22 - um participation with uh I'm not I'm not
54:27 - a official representative of
54:28 - hacktoberfest
54:30 - uh I have no sponsorship relationship
54:32 - with them nothing like that I mention it
54:34 - because it's a nice initiative to bring
54:37 - people into open source
54:39 - and uh part of my mission with the code
54:42 - and train is to help people have a
54:45 - friendly place to be able to participate
54:48 - in open source as well
54:50 - um and so it's there's a nice alignment
54:52 - there and thank you Eric for your nice
54:54 - comments and I hope your second year of
54:56 - university is going well
54:59 - all right so what is hacktoberfest
55:03 - I don't actually know
55:05 - September is the perfect time to prepare
55:08 - for hectoberfest get a jump start by
55:10 - finding projects contribute to adding
55:11 - the Oktoberfest tag to your projects or
55:14 - familiar exercises yourself let's get
55:15 - okay so first of all
55:17 - step number one
55:18 - I don't have my bell which would be
55:20 - useful I do know where it is
55:23 - I'm walking over to get it right now
55:28 - I'm also going to bring bring my little
55:29 - time since clock by the way since my
55:32 - last live stream
55:35 - do you all want to know how many seconds
55:37 - have passed
55:38 - I know this is probably hard for you to
55:39 - see
55:40 - uh it has been
55:42 - 3 million
55:45 - 700 oh no no no
55:49 - oh no wait this is minutes hours I
55:52 - should know how this Clock Works anyway
55:53 - that's how much time has passed
55:55 - I love this project time since launch
55:57 - you should I I talked a lot about it my
55:59 - last live stream you can you can look
56:01 - that up okay I like to put it here so
56:03 - people can see it
56:06 - but then I have to raise the desk a
56:07 - little bit otherwise it doesn't show up
56:09 - and it's not going to show up anyway
56:12 - back here maybe
56:15 - focus focus shiftman okay
56:18 - get a jump start by finding projects to
56:20 - contribute to
56:22 - you found a project to contribute to the
56:24 - coding trade
56:26 - adding the hacktoberfest tag to your
56:29 - projects all right is that a thing I
56:31 - should do right
56:33 - am I supposed now I know there's some
56:35 - complicated discussion about this that
56:36 - we've had internally
56:38 - amongst the coding train team
56:43 - um
56:44 - Jennifer Nesbitt I do I do have a
56:47 - designer helping me on the cover but I'd
56:49 - love to hear from you about what ideas
56:51 - you might have and I'm open to
56:55 - um hearing more so please uh best way is
56:58 - to join the Discord you can send me a
57:00 - message there
57:02 - um
57:02 - [Applause]
57:03 - uh all right so first of all I'm just
57:05 - curious which is a quick peek and see
57:10 - if I go back to the nature of code repo
57:13 - did that thing go just curious if that
57:15 - action completed
57:19 - no so I'll have to investigate why the
57:22 - actions aren't working later but back to
57:24 - hacktoberfest
57:26 - so let's say
57:28 - let's take a look let's so so let's look
57:31 - at the coding train
57:34 - uh repos
57:37 - let's start let's start by making a new
57:44 - well I I'm trying I have about a half an
57:46 - hour I'm trying to think of what I want
57:48 - to do but
57:50 - these are this is the kind of all right
57:54 - can I please finish the sentence
57:55 - apparently not
58:00 - okay oh let me just check
58:04 - ah oh oh I'm getting act uh start
58:07 - bugging you my mailing okay okay okay
58:08 - all right by the way there's a wonderful
58:10 - question that I forgot to address
58:13 - uh by interoctave all in the Discord
58:16 - member chat so first of all members any
58:18 - disc any members people who have signed
58:20 - up through YouTube membership or patreon
58:22 - or GitHub sponsorship
58:25 - the stickers have all come in I have a
58:28 - whole new batch of coding train stickers
58:31 - with the new logo and some new stickers
58:33 - and there's a glow-in-the-dark sticker
58:35 - there's a holographic sticker the
58:37 - mailing for that is going to be going
58:38 - out
58:40 - beginning of October so stay tuned you
58:44 - you make sure you're in the Discord and
58:46 - you have the supporter role that way
58:49 - you'll get the message for how to get
58:50 - your stickers and if anybody's really
58:52 - interested in the stickers you know
58:54 - now's your time because I'm gonna be
58:55 - sending them out very soon once a year
58:57 - mailing it's our new thing okay now
59:02 - Oktoberfest oh the translation I want to
59:05 - address this because it's a wonderful
59:06 - question from interactive all
59:09 - I would very much like to have
59:10 - translations of the nature of code book
59:13 - I have to finish everything I have to do
59:15 - with it before that can start but I'm
59:18 - we're getting very close to there
59:20 - uh I don't remember what date I said to
59:22 - bothered me about a Halloween after
59:24 - October 20th that would be also a good
59:27 - time to bother me about the translations
59:29 - uh
59:30 - I got it I would think November 1st
59:33 - let's put it on November 1st start
59:35 - messaging me if you're interested in
59:37 - doing a translation in the nature of
59:39 - code book and
59:41 - um
59:42 - I what I will probably do is put you in
59:45 - touch with the publisher there's really
59:47 - two questions there uh one is can I get
59:50 - the website translated and have like a a
59:53 - a really easy system of doing that a
59:56 - night so that maybe you know in a
59:58 - fantasy world uh you know there might be
60:01 - a language button on this page here
60:03 - where I could just change it to for
60:06 - example Spanish and the website which
60:07 - only be in Spanish so that's a that's
60:09 - one aspect of this that is something
60:10 - that I have a lot of agency over in
60:14 - terms of translating for a print version
60:16 - of the book that will be something that
60:19 - um that no starch will uh the no search
60:21 - press will lead the process of and I
60:23 - know they're excited to do that so um in
60:25 - terms of partnering with translators and
60:27 - other Publishers and other countries
60:30 - um all of that I'm excited to work on
60:32 - but that will
60:34 - um that way so the stickers are not
60:36 - there's no really there is one place
60:39 - where you can buy some stickers for the
60:40 - coding train which is in the nebulous
60:43 - store I have a coding train page which
60:45 - has a sticker sheet there
60:47 - um but none of the new stickers are
60:49 - there the stickers are really something
60:50 - I send out as gifts for people who
60:52 - subscribe to some of the crowdfunding
60:55 - options for the site or I give to people
60:57 - in person when I go to an event or see
60:58 - them so if I happen to have them on the
61:00 - street with me
61:01 - on the street I can get I mean I often
61:03 - have stickers just my backpack so if I
61:05 - run into somebody else the hand of a
61:06 - sticker
61:07 - uh all right now so that was the that
61:11 - was about the translation oh did you see
61:13 - that
61:14 - my reflexes I still got it still got it
61:16 - okay
61:17 - uh all right now hacktoberfest
61:22 - so
61:24 - back to the coding train
61:26 - so any of these repos in my mind are
61:30 - fair game for Oktoberfest and they're
61:33 - all have varying degrees of being active
61:37 - actively being worked on versus an old
61:40 - thing that's just kind of languishing
61:42 - there and also you're you know in terms
61:45 - of documentation and request for actual
61:48 - help so if anybody sees a repo here that
61:51 - they want to ask about
61:53 - um let me know I've been doing some some
61:55 - new things I just started like for
61:57 - example
61:59 - um I you know this is brand new as of a
62:01 - few days ago I started like working with
62:03 - some experiments with the YouTube API
62:05 - um you can see some other things on here
62:08 - all everything's fair game as far as I'm
62:09 - concerned but I think probably the most
62:13 - important place
62:16 - for you to think about contributing
62:19 - would be here at the codenttrain.com
62:21 - website so
62:23 - uh hopefully there's a lot of wonderful
62:26 - people in the community who help to
62:28 - maintain the website
62:30 - um
62:31 - and you can and and maybe if we can uh
62:36 - do some work on this I'll try to add
62:39 - maybe some issues or some information as
62:42 - a guide somewhere to some suggested
62:44 - things you can work on but
62:47 - one of the nicest ways that you could if
62:50 - you're a total beginner to this world
62:52 - that you could do a pull request that's
62:55 - part of hacktoberfest would be by adding
62:58 - a project that you've made
63:01 - related to one of the videos that I've
63:03 - put out to the passenger showcase
63:07 - the passenger showcase
63:09 - as I may have mentioned is here
63:12 - this is part of the website where it's
63:15 - just essentially an infinite scroll of
63:18 - sorted by uh chronologically of projects
63:21 - people have contributed so number one
63:23 - this is a wonderful place for you to
63:25 - look for inspiration and see what other
63:27 - fellow Travelers in the coding train
63:29 - Community are making
63:31 - you can also do things like I noticed
63:34 - Kathy has made many many so uh oops that
63:37 - goes to
63:38 - how do I oh no I I thought we were gonna
63:40 - that's a feature we were going to add
63:42 - where you click on somebody's name and
63:43 - it takes you to all of their showcase
63:46 - projects but right now I can filter by
63:48 - somebody so if I filter by Kathy I can
63:51 - see all of Kathy's showpace projects on
63:54 - this page and essentially it is a you
63:57 - know portfolio page for any given if you
64:00 - want to have a little portfolio page of
64:01 - your peop your sketches and projects you
64:04 - could kind of use the coding trade
64:05 - website for that it's not really well
64:08 - suited for that there's other tools like
64:10 - open processing and all sorts of other
64:12 - you know build your own website things
64:13 - but on some level you can collect all of
64:15 - the things you've made related to coding
64:17 - trade videos onto one page
64:19 - so how do you do that
64:21 - the main way that people do that
64:23 - under the guides here you can find this
64:26 - passenger showcase guide so if I click
64:29 - on that
64:31 - um
64:32 - then here is a form so this forum allows
64:35 - you to first pick like oh what
64:38 - collection of videos did you just watch
64:40 - was it a coding challenge you never just
64:43 - watch it it's basically the way that the
64:45 - the system works is every project is
64:48 - associated with a video and I know it's
64:50 - sometimes tricky to figure out like does
64:52 - it make sense for this video or that
64:53 - video but you know we we just all use
64:55 - our best judgment and try to make it
64:56 - work the best we can so for example if
64:58 - you were watching a beginner's guide to
65:00 - machine learning you would find like oh
65:02 - here's all the videos here maybe I made
65:03 - a video that was used
65:06 - um
65:08 - you know object detection and so I'm
65:10 - gonna click on that and I'm gonna submit
65:12 - my project to there now most commonly
65:15 - people are making projects related to
65:17 - the coding challenges for example I
65:19 - think it's the 10 print I got 178 of
65:22 - them really slowed down
65:24 - uh the 10 print I don't know I don't
65:26 - know I think was it like 82 no that's a
65:29 - Chrome extension does anybody see it
65:30 - here
65:31 - and it doesn't matter I don't have to
65:32 - pick it here um I could just pick
65:34 - anything like double pendulum and then
65:36 - you can enter all your information so
65:38 - what this form does I'm getting the
65:40 - point here
65:42 - this form
65:44 - generates a pull request
65:47 - to
65:49 - the GitHub repository for the website
65:51 - however
65:53 - if you want to so if you want to get
65:56 - your project on the website this is your
65:58 - easiest path to doing it however if you
66:00 - want to participate in hacktoberfest you
66:04 - can actually do you can submit your
66:06 - project without this form through GitHub
66:10 - itself I want to show you a little bit
66:12 - about how to do that right now and that
66:15 - will then give you a hacktoberfest uh
66:18 - accepted pull request
66:19 - so let me see if I can walk you through
66:24 - a little bit about that right now so a
66:25 - couple things one is ah one is on this
66:28 - passenger showcase guide and this is a
66:30 - mental note to myself in the community
66:31 - we could probably improve this
66:34 - um
66:34 - you can also we have some instructions
66:37 - here for how to do that so the form will
66:39 - do this automatically but the manual way
66:42 - of creating the pull request for
66:43 - Oktoberfest is here below these
66:46 - instructions might need a little
66:48 - updating I'm not sure I'll have to take
66:49 - a look at that
66:51 - but let me show you a little bit about
66:53 - that right now
66:55 - and I'm just checking the
66:58 - uh checking the chat okay
67:01 - um all right so uh coming back to here
67:03 - so let's say the first thing so let's go
67:06 - let's pretend we're going to do 10 print
67:07 - and I'm looking at the time so I'm going
67:10 - to uh 10 print
67:14 - is I believe the coding challenge that
67:17 - has the most passenger showcase projects
67:20 - you can see them all here on this page
67:23 - that includes the video the code example
67:26 - other references an archive of the live
67:29 - stream where I actually originally did
67:30 - the challenge and things like that so
67:33 - you know if you're new to the coding
67:35 - train and you're wondering
67:37 - is there a lot of stuff I can go back
67:38 - and look at there's a lot there's a lot
67:40 - personally
67:40 - okay
67:42 - so if you wanted to submit to this of
67:44 - course you could use the form but if
67:46 - you're not using the form and you're
67:48 - participating in hacktoberfest what you
67:50 - would do is you need to find the video
67:51 - first so content
67:54 - is the place where all of the individual
67:58 - files directories for the videos and
68:01 - their Associated passenger showcases
68:02 - live so I'm going to click on content
68:05 - then I need to find ah then under videos
68:09 - is where I'm looking there's other in
68:11 - stuff here that's useful but videos is
68:13 - what we're looking for and here now is
68:16 - this becomes a little bit of detective
68:18 - work but it's pretty easy if you're
68:19 - doing a challenge so that the folder
68:21 - naming is a little wonky all the videos
68:23 - that are everywhere on the site but for
68:26 - the challenges it's not too hard I can
68:28 - just go here and I can see ah there is a
68:30 - directory for every single one so what
68:33 - was 10 print what number was 10 print
68:36 - 10 print was number 76.
68:40 - so back to here I'm going to go and find
68:43 - number 76
68:47 - scrolling around I've got it and we can
68:50 - see here okay so what is here on GitHub
68:53 - first and foremost just so you are aware
68:56 - there is the JS this individual Json
68:59 - page this is the metadata for the videos
69:01 - and by the way one of the things about
69:03 - the system that I have built with I I
69:06 - barely did any of this work
69:08 - so I know that depong in particular has
69:11 - a ton of work on this this Json file
69:14 - there's a script that's part of the repo
69:16 - that will generate the YouTube
69:17 - description for it so this is all the
69:19 - metadata for this particular video and
69:22 - this is another thing you could
69:23 - contribute to for hacktoberfest some of
69:26 - them could might have typos uh in the
69:29 - time codes maybe the the they're missing
69:31 - a link it could be improved there's all
69:34 - sorts of things you could think about to
69:35 - improve and and
69:38 - I was gonna say punch up these pages to
69:40 - give them a bit more but what you're
69:42 - looking for is here showcase notice now
69:46 - here that there are all these files
69:49 - contribution number.json
69:53 - contributionnumber.png some of them have
69:55 - what like a much larger number some of
69:57 - them have a smaller number
69:58 - all you need to create to submit your
70:03 - project to the coding Train website is
70:06 - to add to this directory and most of the
70:09 - directors won't be this full and if you
70:12 - find a video that doesn't have any
70:14 - showcase projects you have to create the
70:16 - directory but most of them do at this
70:17 - point you need to add to this directory
70:20 - two files
70:22 - a Json file and a PNG let's just look at
70:26 - what these look like let's look at
70:27 - contribution 12.
70:29 - and your Json file just needs to have a
70:33 - few things in it needs to have a title
70:35 - of your project an author name a URL of
70:39 - the project and a time stamp for when it
70:42 - was submitted using this particular
70:44 - format and the coding train Discord the
70:47 - GitHub issues these are places where you
70:49 - can post and ask about to get help doing
70:51 - this if it's confusing
70:53 - cough is asking if I do a coding
70:56 - challenge but use Unity would it be
70:58 - valid Not only would it be valid that's
71:01 - what I'm hoping for the whole point of
71:04 - this is not about using the tools that
71:07 - I'm using and
71:09 - following the way that I do things but
71:12 - sharing the way that you do things and
71:14 - the tools that you use with the
71:16 - community the fact that the Showcase
71:18 - projects are linked to their videos is
71:20 - just a way of organizing them by theme
71:22 - and I don't have a great way for people
71:24 - like I made something I want to share it
71:26 - but I don't it's not associated with a
71:28 - video there's no place for that right
71:30 - now on the website but
71:32 - um but yes absolutely
71:35 - um okay so um so this is the format for
71:39 - the Json file by the way the author name
71:41 - can also have a URL so you can have a
71:43 - separate URL which is of your own social
71:45 - media or website in addition to just
71:48 - this URL we looked at other ones we
71:49 - might see that
71:51 - um and then uh oops which which one was
71:54 - that was that number 17 I don't even
71:56 - remember now which one
71:58 - 12 not 17. then if I look at
72:01 - contribution so you need a file called
72:03 - actually it doesn't even have to have
72:05 - the word contribution in it I don't
72:07 - remember somebody might know this in the
72:10 - chat
72:12 - uh the instructions are good for the
72:14 - challenges still okay yeah
72:15 - um
72:17 - so
72:18 - um
72:19 - I don't remember whether it actually has
72:21 - to be called contribution but it just
72:23 - needs to have a unique name uh with a
72:26 - number so the um the form uh has a I
72:29 - don't know if I forgot what it uses a
72:31 - time stamp or something for naming the
72:33 - file but if you create your own through
72:36 - a manual process for hacktoberfest you
72:38 - just need to say contribution some
72:40 - number that isn't already listed so and
72:43 - then you need to both name your Json
72:44 - file and the PNG the same name
72:48 - so now you can see this is the thumbnail
72:51 - image and if I were to go to the uh that
72:53 - page
72:55 - I've already lost it oh this is the
72:57 - deploy preview do I have the I'll just
73:00 - find it again 10 print
73:04 - go to this page you can see here that by
73:08 - the way this the order of the projects
73:10 - on this page is random and different
73:13 - every time I load it if you're wondering
73:14 - like well how do I get to be first
73:17 - refresh depending on the number of
73:19 - challenges eventually you'll be first so
73:22 - if I go through at some point we're
73:24 - going to see that one
73:26 - um I saw the name but it looks like a
73:28 - different thumbnail so yeah here it is
73:30 - so we can see this is the one we were
73:31 - looking at
73:33 - um and it shows up here and by the way
73:34 - if I were to click on it it's going to
73:36 - take me to the page for the actual
73:37 - project the wonderful uh I love these
73:39 - colors I love the ones and zeros what a
73:41 - wonderful job from hater Ali Punjabi
73:44 - so um so that's the process
73:48 - I'm not uh you know as you might uh be
73:52 - realizing I'm not and I would love to to
73:55 - find a different time to maybe do this
73:56 - if that would be helpful but if you've
73:58 - never used GitHub before I kind of told
74:01 - you about how it works and I showed you
74:03 - where some instructions are but you're
74:05 - going to have some trouble probably
74:06 - you're going to want you to ask
74:07 - questions so you could get help
74:10 - the places where you can get help is you
74:13 - can file an issue so you can type new
74:15 - issue title it I need help submitting my
74:17 - passenger showcase project
74:19 - write about what you need help with what
74:21 - your questions are and someone hopefully
74:24 - hopefully I or somebody else from the
74:26 - community will be able to answer your
74:27 - questions and help you out there
74:29 - the other place is the coding train
74:31 - Discord where there are help channels uh
74:35 - and lots of other people there who are
74:36 - available to answer questions and help
74:38 - you get your project into the passenger
74:40 - showcase so to summarize
74:43 - the easiest way to get your project into
74:45 - the passenger showcase is with
74:49 - this form
74:52 - if you want to participate in
74:54 - hacktoberfest
74:55 - you can follow these instructions for
74:58 - how to do it manually through a pull
74:59 - request
75:02 - but if you're new to all this that's not
75:04 - going to be the easiest thing in the
75:05 - world for you to do so raise your hand
75:07 - ask for help
75:09 - the coding train Community is here to
75:11 - help you figure that out I would like
75:13 - very much for it to be a welcoming and
75:14 - friendly place for you to make your
75:16 - first attempt at a pull request
75:18 - regardless of how many times you fail or
75:20 - how many mistakes you made that is the
75:23 - point
75:26 - um okay
75:27 - now
75:30 - what else do I want to say so I'm I'm
75:33 - closing in on the end of this live
75:35 - stream
75:36 - and I want to talk about
75:40 - something
75:41 - new
75:43 - which is and I'm going to minimize some
75:45 - things which is this
75:48 - so this is I can't remember if I how
75:50 - much I showed this the last time I was
75:51 - live streaming I think I did now that I
75:53 - think about it but anyway
75:55 - uh this is a new logo for the coding
75:58 - train
76:00 - um with this wonderful little uh ASCII
76:03 - art like illustration of a train it is
76:07 - made with simple shapes lines and
76:09 - circles
76:10 - um also a little a catchphrase traveling
76:12 - the wonderful world of code another idea
76:14 - for the catchphrases artisanal
76:17 - handcrafted code
76:20 - but um anyway this is what it had so far
76:23 - um and you can see that inside this
76:25 - scene in this wallpaper the reason why
76:27 - I'm bringing this up and one of the
76:28 - reasons for this new logo was to have
76:34 - something that could connect more
76:36 - directly with p5.js
76:41 - and processing and so for example if you
76:44 - go to the processing website you'll
76:46 - notice here this is the processing logo
76:49 - and if you click on open editor you'll
76:52 - see this is code to draw this particular
76:57 - logo and you can do things like you know
76:59 - change the color I could change a number
77:01 - actually
77:03 - and it's going to like change how it
77:05 - looks the design all of that so
77:08 - I am now going to go to the p5.js
77:12 - web editor
77:15 - and by the way the new stickers have the
77:18 - logo and all sorts of other stuff which
77:20 - is very exciting the other thing I'm
77:22 - doing with the stickers is a lot of the
77:23 - stickers the new stickers are just
77:25 - literal visualizations of some of the
77:27 - examples so there's like a whirly noise
77:28 - sticker like end body simulation sticker
77:32 - but let's see if I can log in here
77:36 - uh and do open and look for maybe logo
77:43 - copy copy
77:45 - I don't know why there's a copy copy in
77:46 - this one but let's
77:48 - let's try this
77:51 - and here it is okay
77:53 - so here is now the P5 sketch and by the
77:56 - way as much as I said artisanal
77:58 - handcrafted code
78:00 - the way I actually generated this is the
78:03 - design was made with uh I don't know
78:05 - whether Jason actually used illustrator
78:07 - or what tool he used but I have an SVG
78:10 - formatted file of the design and I used
78:12 - a large language model to convert that
78:15 - into uh the code with just drawing every
78:18 - line individually so it is a little bit
78:20 - ridiculous like probably the example for
78:23 - this doesn't need this level of
78:25 - precision for all the pixel values
78:28 - but this is my ask for you and I think
78:31 - this is a good place
78:33 - for us to for me to start a new repo
78:35 - that could also be part of hacktoberfest
78:37 - so let's think about this
78:40 - I would love for people to remix this
78:42 - logo maybe I should do like a video
78:44 - about it giving some ideas and some
78:46 - techniques or like demonstrating it but
78:48 - right now all I have is the literal
78:50 - a hard-coded values of the design but
78:53 - what would it mean for it to animate
78:55 - what would it mean for it to break apart
78:57 - come back together what kind of creative
78:59 - things make it sound responsive change
79:02 - the colors I would love to see what
79:04 - people who from the community could do
79:06 - remixing this logo and playing with it
79:08 - and I think there could be a lot of fun
79:10 - stuff and and I just want to say
79:13 - um Jeff Wagner who I know has been
79:14 - posting a ton of stuff in the chat uh
79:16 - thank you for all of your kind comments
79:17 - okay and gisha thanks for asking how I'm
79:20 - feeling
79:22 - honestly like I know I'm feeling good
79:23 - but I I'm I'm
79:26 - I feel like I'm really struggling to
79:28 - keep up with
79:30 - work
79:32 - and by work I mean teaching and the
79:35 - nature of code book and the YouTube
79:36 - channel and all these emails that I have
79:39 - to respond to so I feel very out of
79:41 - sorts and disorganized like my
79:44 - um
79:46 - they just I feel off and some of that
79:49 - might just be
79:51 - getting older
79:53 - can't do as much some of it might be
79:56 - just the last few years of everything
79:58 - that sort of changed in the world some
80:00 - of it might just be this fall semester
80:01 - is particularly busy but I think it's
80:03 - mostly just that I'm trying to really
80:04 - finish the nature of code book project
80:06 - so anyway but thanks for asking okay uh
80:11 - now
80:15 - um all right so what do I want to so I
80:17 - think maybe what I'm going to do this is
80:18 - a spur of the moment idea
80:21 - uh let's create very quickly a GitHub
80:25 - repo for this for the logo
80:29 - and I don't know what
80:32 - should actually go in it
80:34 - but let's give this a start okay
80:37 - so I'm going to call this I'm going to
80:38 - put it in coding drain
80:41 - what should I call it a coding
80:45 - train logo unfortunately there's another
80:49 - name like anyway I'll just call it that
80:51 - it's going to be public it's going to
80:53 - have a readme file
80:55 - it's going to be for lack of a different
80:59 - option right now that I MIT license
81:03 - I mean the design I would say is maybe
81:06 - Creative Commons non-commercial but I'm
81:08 - not going to worry about that right now
81:10 - and
81:14 - now ordinarily what I would do
81:19 - which I think makes sense maybe I should
81:21 - do what I would ordinarily do so order
81:23 - there's so many different ways to create
81:25 - a repository on GitHub what you saw me
81:28 - do just now is manually create one
81:30 - during using the interface and honestly
81:32 - what I was thinking is like oh let me
81:33 - just add some new files to it like I
81:35 - could actually add that let's just do
81:37 - this this is kind of wacky but let's add
81:40 - index.html and we're just going to go
81:42 - here
81:43 - and we're going to uh paste this in
81:46 - there
81:47 - yeah yeah why not I don't need the sound
81:50 - library right now and I feel like it
81:53 - should but you know the whole point is
81:55 - that people can improve this so I'm not
81:56 - even going to worry about it and I'm
81:57 - going to say uh creating index.html
82:00 - that's perfectly I'm committing to the
82:01 - main branch just just going with it
82:03 - then
82:05 - add another file
82:08 - I'm going to add a file called sketch.js
82:12 - and
82:15 - uh
82:16 - I'm going to put that in here
82:20 - beautiful I'm gonna commit that
82:23 - and say create sketch.js
82:25 - I'm going to go into this file I'm going
82:28 - to you know what I'm going to do is I'm
82:30 - going to make an empty style.css file
82:33 - I'm going to create add a file
82:38 - called uh
82:40 - style.css but I'm not going to worry
82:42 - about what goes in it just yet
82:47 - somebody's asking about quaternions in
82:49 - the chat hilarious okay so now
82:53 - I have this repo
82:57 - if I add do I add to the topics is that
83:00 - where the thing that yapa put
83:02 - hacktoberfest
83:03 - topics
83:06 - is this where the hacktoberfest thing
83:07 - goes
83:11 - is that what I'm supposed to do let's
83:12 - just put it in there and see okay so now
83:15 - this is a hacktoberfest repo I'm making
83:16 - this repo specifically for Oktoberfest
83:18 - as well
83:20 - I might regret this later we'll see what
83:22 - happens
83:24 - um and now
83:26 - what I want to do and I'm going to just
83:27 - I so I have my GitHub linked to netlify
83:31 - and I like to build so I could use
83:34 - GitHub pages to host this sort of main
83:38 - page that
83:40 - um
83:41 - has the logo thing I mean I should just
83:42 - use GitHub pages right now and I'll
83:44 - switch it later but I just don't know
83:45 - what this is going to reveal if I go
83:46 - into my settings
83:48 - so
83:50 - um let me I'm doing this without you
83:52 - being able to look at it
83:55 - um
83:56 - and where is I'm just going to go down
83:58 - to GitHub pages
84:02 - um and I'm going to do it from the main
84:04 - branch
84:05 - employee from a branch I might switch
84:07 - this over to like a netlify build or
84:09 - something later
84:10 - but right now
84:13 - I just
84:15 - uh oh you can't see this hold on let me
84:17 - just finish what I was doing
84:18 - and then you'll be able to see it
84:24 - I lost we're okay uh where is the pages
84:27 - GitHub Pages ah
84:29 - Pages there it is
84:32 - sorry sorry sorry sorry
84:42 - I don't understand I
84:44 - uh
84:47 - all right I'm just gonna assume
84:51 - that this is working now
84:54 - I'm going to come back to here
84:57 - usually okay so now
85:00 - let's see if I go to
85:03 - codingtrain.github.io coding train dash
85:05 - logo
85:08 - did I get that wrong
85:10 - or maybe just hasn't built yet so I
85:14 - once I get this working the sketch would
85:17 - appear here
85:18 - so what do I think this repo is for now
85:21 - here's what I think couple things one is
85:24 - so you know uh just I'm gonna I'll make
85:28 - like a uh
85:29 - live stream
85:33 - brainstorming list
85:37 - uh these are things
85:41 - I'm looking for help with for
85:44 - hacktoberfest
85:47 - later
85:49 - I should break these into separate
85:52 - issues so first of all what are things
85:55 - that might improve this repo
85:58 - um that you might like to suggest in the
86:00 - chat I'm keeping an eye on it
86:03 - um
86:04 - all right so first of all uh read me
86:07 - that explains what the coding train is
86:11 - an image of the logo and what this repo
86:15 - is all about so you could work on the
86:17 - readme
86:19 - um
86:22 - create the the best uh or like any
86:28 - changes that improve
86:32 - how the code
86:35 - reads for beginners and makes it easier
86:39 - to build upon
86:45 - maybe a system for people to add their
86:51 - own variations of the logo this is a
86:54 - bigger project
86:58 - um what else uh ports of the logo to
87:03 - other
87:04 - languages
87:08 - what else
87:11 - so this is the idea I'm trying to think
87:13 - of a list of things that people could
87:16 - work on for this particular repo
87:19 - so I'm going to submit this issue
87:22 - and there we go
87:24 - so this is a repo that I am setting up
87:28 - without much of a plan if I'm being
87:30 - honest which share and and also let's
87:33 - put this in
87:35 - at least in the in the readme
87:38 - let me
87:40 - um just put this here so it's there
87:44 - um
87:46 - this the idea for this repo is maybe I
87:49 - can maybe it can be a friendly place a
87:53 - sort of small low stakes project
87:57 - that people could kind of practice using
87:59 - git and GitHub with like you could pull
88:01 - requests all sorts of stuff here and we
88:03 - can sort of play around with it
88:04 - similarly to my uh that rainbow the poem
88:08 - repo that goes along with my git and
88:10 - GitHub video tutorials so that's the
88:13 - last thing on my agenda for today
88:16 - um besides so I want to talk about the
88:18 - new processing course out now on nebula
88:20 - pinned comment if you want access to
88:22 - that I wanted to talk about the nature
88:26 - of code book which is coming along you
88:28 - can read it online you can pre-order it
88:30 - and I wanted to talk about how I intend
88:33 - to hopefully participate in
88:35 - hacktoberfest and how you can submit to
88:38 - the passenger showcase
88:40 - and start this new repo maybe to help
88:43 - people play around with their own
88:45 - variations of the coding train logo
88:48 - did my um now before I go
88:52 - it did just happen to notice here
88:54 - that there are a lot
88:59 - of
89:01 - pull requests right now in the actual
89:04 - coding train repo itself
89:06 - so one is from me that I forgot that I
89:10 - did so one thing I did by the way here's
89:11 - something that you could do uh also with
89:14 - the website
89:16 - all of the videos are associated with
89:19 - topics and languages and I was noticing
89:22 - when I was searching for some Pi Day
89:24 - videos like I have a video about the
89:27 - leibniz
89:28 - um
89:30 - uh formula for approximating pi the uh
89:33 - how Pi in the mandelbrot set are related
89:36 - buffon's needle all these videos related
89:39 - to Pi approximation and Pi Day but the
89:42 - uh topics list was not consistent
89:44 - between them so I was updating that so
89:46 - that's the one thing that I am that
89:48 - people can contribute to if you're
89:50 - looking for a non-showcase way to
89:51 - contribute to the website is to look at
89:55 - um you know if I go to the challenges
89:57 - for example and I search by like fractal
90:00 - I wouldn't be surprised if there's a
90:02 - coding challenge that deals with
90:03 - fractals that maybe I missed or that
90:06 - some topic or tag is sort of
90:07 - inconsistently Applied so that's
90:09 - something that um people can help with
90:11 - I'm going to go ahead and merge this one
90:13 - I think I was waiting for the tests to
90:15 - pass and I forgot so I'm going to merge
90:17 - this pull request that I made
90:20 - um then you'll see all of these shows oh
90:22 - Kathy who does a wonderful job curating
90:24 - uh the featured showcases and challenges
90:27 - that are on the home page uh apologies
90:29 - for missing this
90:31 - um this is from a couple weeks ago let's
90:33 - let these update I'm going to merge
90:35 - Kathy's work here
90:39 - um
90:41 - and let's look now and then oh updating
90:44 - ah so this is uh Depot Sam who is
90:46 - working on updating some of the
90:48 - contributing guides so hopefully this
90:50 - will as this gets updated it'll help
90:52 - with more instructions information for
90:53 - Oktoberfest but let's look at these
90:56 - showcase submissions right now there are
90:58 - five of them and let's see if I can get
91:00 - through them
91:02 - so I just clicked on one and I don't
91:04 - know what happened
91:06 - where am I I've lost
91:09 - I have too many tabs open let me close
91:12 - all these tabs
91:15 - here we are
91:18 - so this is rampana who has created quite
91:21 - a few contributions as of late let's
91:23 - take a look at this so one uh let's take
91:25 - a look at their work here
91:27 - um
91:28 - oh look at that what a fun spiral with
91:31 - rotating rainbow colors great work Pana
91:34 - so I since I'm doing this live I'm just
91:37 - going to merge it often I try to write a
91:38 - little nice comment an encouraging
91:40 - friendly supportive comment it's going
91:42 - to go ahead and merge this one
91:44 - and we'll see hopefully these appear as
91:46 - I merge them the website will rebuild
91:47 - takes a little time let's look at this
91:49 - heart curve one hey wait a second it's
91:52 - Panna again welcome to the coding train
91:55 - Pana hour uh let's look at this
91:59 - uh and
92:01 - oh that is a very cute little bear bear
92:05 - with a heart pulsing and a bone or is it
92:08 - a puppy I'm not really sure but I love
92:10 - it I love all the variables
92:12 - I guess that's meat
92:15 - I don't know that I've seen a variable
92:17 - called meat before but I quite enjoy
92:18 - that
92:20 - um and let's go ahead and merge this
92:22 - wonderful project
92:26 - and now let's go to ah wave function
92:30 - collapse what are we gonna get here oh
92:32 - interesting Dorian makza and Apologies
92:36 - by mispronouncing name created a PHP
92:39 - tiled wave function collapse so let's
92:42 - take a look at this
92:43 - so here as you can see very legitimate
92:47 - and encouraged to use
92:51 - um
92:52 - to use non-up to use other platforms
92:55 - besides P5 and processing the PHP is
92:58 - quite shocking like at least on made way
93:01 - function collapse with PHP that's
93:04 - incredible let's go to their website to
93:07 - see
93:08 - oh this is incredible
93:10 - wow circuit board oh this is so cool
93:15 - simple demo
93:17 - oh wow this is incredible let me try
93:20 - doing 50 space station that's oh 15 is
93:24 - the max okay amazing wow I love this um
93:27 - so if you're not familiar with wave
93:29 - function collapse there's another
93:31 - algorithm also that from many years ago
93:33 - called Model synthesis which is uh very
93:35 - very similar in terms of the tiled model
93:38 - um
93:39 - you can watch my video on it
93:42 - I don't know I don't know what you'll
93:43 - think of it but certainly there
93:46 - um and you can see that this I this is a
93:48 - really incredible documentation and
93:50 - really incredible work so
93:52 - um now let's see here I am going to yes
93:56 - and this is linked to Dorian so I'm
93:58 - going to make sure I leave a comment
94:00 - here this is incredible
94:03 - emerging
94:05 - live okay I don't know if that will make
94:08 - any sense to anybody but um
94:10 - maybe later I can time code when I
94:12 - looked at this um for Dorian to see if
94:15 - they're not watching live right now okay
94:16 - so now there's two fluid simulations
94:19 - sometimes we get redundant ones let me
94:21 - just sort of check
94:24 - so I I didn't finish my thought wave
94:27 - function collapse is an algorithm that
94:30 - looks at a grid and essentially fills
94:33 - each spot of the Grid in with one of
94:36 - some number of options of tiles And Then
94:38 - There are rules for what tiles
94:40 - are allowed to P appear next to each
94:43 - other and with those rules you can
94:45 - generate all sorts of different kinds of
94:46 - patterns
94:47 - so this is from
94:49 - EG back by Rockstar
94:52 - based on the fluid simulation
94:55 - which is one of
94:57 - which is wild uh to see that someone
94:59 - actually was actually able to make
95:00 - something maybe from watching that video
95:02 - this looks like oh there's a nice MP4
95:04 - this is made in processing hey let's
95:07 - download this
95:10 - I want to just download this because
95:11 - it's the processing why not open it up
95:15 - uh download
95:19 - and we can look at the sketch so first
95:21 - of all there's a nice MP4 in here
95:24 - that's pretty cool
95:26 - that is pretty lovely so my guess is
95:30 - maybe so one of the in my fluid
95:32 - simulation video I create perhaps what
95:35 - is the least optimized slowest version
95:38 - ever of fluid of fluid simulation so I
95:42 - don't know and we I'm guessing when we
95:44 - run the processing sketch if it's based
95:45 - on my code it will render every frame
95:48 - very very slowly which then makes sense
95:50 - to render out a video so you can watch
95:52 - it more quickly that said this person
95:54 - might have improved the code greatly and
95:56 - optimized it because it is possible to
95:58 - do fluid simulation with all sorts of uh
96:01 - Excel Hardware accelerated and other
96:03 - techniques to make it work better hello
96:05 - Elkin in the chat
96:09 - uh thank you for your support Elkin are
96:12 - you in the Discord with the supporter
96:14 - tag because the stickers are going to be
96:16 - going out very soon to supporters
96:18 - so check and message if you're not okay
96:21 - let's open this up in processing
96:26 - and see what we've got
96:28 - uh keep it keep it keep it
96:33 - not not right now I do want to get the
96:35 - so I think I messed something up
96:37 - probably let me
96:38 - sometimes processing it's in it it's
96:42 - able to handle this more elegantly now
96:44 - but it's probably my fault sometimes
96:46 - having the um
96:48 - it works better if the pde name is the
96:51 - same as the no and still
96:54 - so I'm not sure what I I wouldn't be
96:56 - surprised if I'm doing something wrong
96:57 - here but I'm not able to get this to run
97:00 - right now maybe somebody can help me
97:02 - figure that out later but this is
97:04 - excellent documentation and we were able
97:06 - to see the video
97:08 - um oh and this is also combined with the
97:11 - purlin noise flow field coding challenge
97:13 - so it could go with that coding
97:16 - challenge as well I don't have a way for
97:18 - showcase projects to be tagged for
97:20 - multiple videos right now so you just
97:22 - have to pick one but this is incredible
97:25 - a minute let's see if they're uh yeah
97:29 - this is incredible
97:32 - I'm reviewing it now during a live
97:35 - stream but I had trouble getting the
97:39 - processing
97:41 - code to run
97:44 - the video is perfect
97:48 - the video is perfect
97:52 - um did I miss something
97:54 - I'm just going to put a little
97:55 - screenshot now
97:57 - of this
97:59 - and
98:02 - attach that
98:05 - to
98:08 - here and one little another little trick
98:12 - I'm going to show you is when you upload
98:15 - an image to like a GitHub issue it's
98:18 - going to do a lot of nice things for you
98:19 - automatically and that image is right
98:22 - here in the issue but one thing it will
98:24 - not do is generate an ALT tag that has
98:28 - any meaning it's just using the name of
98:30 - the file so screen so I like to adjust
98:33 - that when I can for accessibility
98:35 - screenshot of processing IDE with error
98:39 - message and then what was the error
98:41 - message so this is a good fluid cannot
98:45 - hide in closing type
98:47 - fluid cannot hide
98:51 - enclosing type so I'm going to add that
98:53 - in there and now um anybody who's
98:57 - reading this issue with a screen reader
98:59 - will have a description of this image of
99:01 - course my description was not
99:03 - comprehensive I didn't list all the code
99:05 - but I edited down to what I felt was
99:07 - like made the most sense for this
99:08 - context I suppose I'm inadvertently
99:11 - training somebody's large image
99:13 - generator model by labeling images for
99:16 - them but it's worth it for
99:18 - um
99:20 - accessibility and James Haskin
99:23 - uh five years ago wow that's amazing
99:25 - thank you so much for watching and
99:27 - tuning in and supporting the channel
99:28 - okay
99:29 - now uh let's merge this pull request
99:35 - I'm gonna merge it
99:37 - I am going to get back to the pull
99:40 - requests
99:41 - I'm going to look at this one which
99:43 - looks like this was a duplicate so I'm
99:45 - I'm going to say I merged this happened
99:48 - sometimes with the form
99:50 - uh this is one two
99:52 - one two two nine so one two two eight uh
99:57 - closing this one so let's do that
100:00 - excellent just doing a little
100:01 - maintenance here a little cleanup of the
100:04 - old coding Train website
100:07 - um and I'm gonna go here
100:10 - and
100:12 - yeah there's a few so now now we're now
100:15 - we're in good shape there's only six
100:16 - open pull requests this is
100:19 - um for the new logging processing video
100:21 - won't be in it it finished till that is
100:23 - on YouTube
100:24 - um this is something the tpom is working
100:26 - on this is somebody who really gave a
100:28 - heroic effort to try to manually add a
100:30 - showcase project but
100:31 - um we need to fix it up still and then I
100:33 - forget what these are I think there's
100:34 - some open questions about which videos
100:36 - those go with but I'll have to deal with
100:38 - those another time okay
100:40 - um so uh thank you all for tuning in
100:44 - today to this live stream I
100:47 - am going to turn this a little this
100:49 - little song I'm Gonna Play in the
100:50 - background down
100:52 - um I'm sorry that this was kind of short
100:54 - on structured disorganized messy
100:57 - unhelpful boring I don't know whatever
101:00 - criticism you want to lob at it I'm
101:02 - sorry for that
101:04 - um I wanted to at least turn on the
101:06 - equipment fire up the old
101:09 - camera machine to
101:12 - take pictures of me and beam them out to
101:14 - you on the internet live just to update
101:16 - you on what's going on at a minimum I
101:20 - always want to have a live stream at
101:21 - least once a month on the coding train
101:23 - and
101:25 - I'm excited to see what happens when the
101:27 - new beginner processing video comes out
101:29 - on YouTube if it brings more people back
101:30 - to the channel
101:34 - My Views are declining at a rather
101:39 - extreme Pace but it kind of makes sense
101:42 - because I haven't published anything new
101:43 - in quite some time it's fine I don't
101:45 - it's no problem
101:47 - we're gonna get back to it gonna make
101:49 - some more challenges get the get the old
101:52 - grind the gears of the code machine make
101:56 - it happen write some artisanal
101:58 - handcrafted code it's coming
102:01 - uh Daniel Rubio says thank you for the
102:03 - channel uh Barney says no need to
102:05 - apologize and cough says it was an
102:07 - amazing live stream I love your energy
102:09 - oh you're all saying such nice things to
102:11 - me it's so nice also
102:14 - I I don't know if any of you notice but
102:16 - the Baltimore Orioles are in first place
102:20 - in the American League East they're
102:21 - leaving Tampa Bay hoping to go to one of
102:24 - their last games of the Season got to
102:25 - make the trip down to Baltimore to catch
102:27 - them it has been there I think it was
102:29 - was it 86 when I was a kid and they won
102:31 - the World Series or made it to the World
102:32 - Series I was a young lad
102:34 - back then in the 19 the 1900s
102:39 - I have like this new hip pain thing I
102:41 - gotta go to physical therapy for that
102:44 - I look so young
102:46 - people always you know I don't know
102:48 - what's happened
102:50 - let's can I show you this I find this a
102:52 - little distressing
102:53 - [Music]
102:56 - like I don't uh let's just turn off the
102:59 - sound here we don't need the sound
103:03 - but you know this is me now I look
103:06 - energetic healthy I look all right
103:10 - look at that young whippersnapper with
103:12 - no gray hair and
103:15 - Perfect Skin
103:19 - no bald spots
103:21 - no back pain
103:24 - you know what happened to that guy oh
103:26 - that's that's more like it there you go
103:28 - I do have new glasses do you like that
103:30 - but go go Orioles come on all you tell
103:33 - you don't care about baseball nobody
103:34 - cares about as well you might as well
103:36 - root for the Orioles
103:39 - oh the song ran out
103:42 - um
103:42 - okay I'm gonna answer this question I
103:45 - think I've seen in the chat maybe a
103:46 - thousand times has there been a
103:48 - challenge about make your own Gan uh no
103:50 - but I did a bunch of live streams with
103:52 - an auto making an auto encoder with
103:54 - tensorflow.js so you might go back and
103:56 - find those uh can I make Super Mario
103:59 - Brothers Olivia am asks I would really
104:01 - like to get back to oh in suik thank you
104:04 - for that very kind uh Super Chat there
104:06 - it's very kind of you
104:09 - um
104:12 - and uh they're moving to Vegas the A's
104:15 - are moving to Vegas not the Orioles I
104:17 - hope that's what you're talking about
104:18 - but
104:20 - um
104:21 - I already forgot what I was saying but
104:23 - oh yeah if you're interested in that go
104:25 - look at the auto encoder videos oh so
104:28 - what's coming up next
104:30 - I am teaching in my class in just a
