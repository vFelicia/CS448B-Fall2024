00:00 - Hello welcome to another programming from Ato Z course video this video.
00:05 - I'm going to look at a feature
of what really a feature of
00:09 - the world the web browser and look at in the context of P5js and Javascript.
00:14 - How do you get text input from a user.
00:16 - So first I just want to
talk you through over here.
00:18 - What the basic what the three or
four methodology I'm going to use.
00:23 - So number one is if you want to get
text input from the user you can use
00:27 - something called an input element.
00:31 - So input element is a little box that
appears in a browser window where you can
00:35 - say you know in a web form
you might say like name and
00:38 - then you know you write your name in here.
00:41 - You could also use something
called a text area.
00:47 - And a text area is the same idea.
00:49 - It's just bigger and it's usually
resizable the user can kind of drag this
00:53 - corner around for
a longer bit of text entry.
00:57 - So if you want the user to type in
a paragraph of text and use that in your
01:02 - program. You can use a text area and then
you could also get, you could ask the user
01:08 - to submit or you or
you could simply load the... spoiler so
01:13 - many other ways that they're not going
to get to because you could use API
01:15 - Scroll the web and scrape it we'll get
to that stuff later in a future video.
01:19 - But what I'm thinking about right now is: you could also get input from a text file
01:23 - itself.
01:25 - And you could use for that you could
use the load strings method in
01:29 - p5js or you could simply
just reference an actual text file
01:34 - that you have us in your sort
directory of files.You could also use
01:39 - a file input and if you've ever seen
a web browser you have a little button
01:45 - that says like choose File and you can
actually create that with the p5js
01:50 - function I think called createFIleInput.
And I'll show you how to use that as well.
01:56 - And finally you could
create a Div a sort of area.
02:00 - a box of stuff on your screen
02:03 - that you could - in the browser itself-
that you could drag a text file over and
02:07 - I actually have a separate video tutorial
that just goes over that which I might
02:11 - just reference rather than
included in this video tutorial.
02:13 - So I'm going to go
through all of these and
02:15 - you can also look at
the dragable area video and
02:19 - you'll see these as possible ways
of getting text input because
02:23 - What I'm going to do is say
" hey user submit some text and
02:26 - I'm to generate a poem of
from that text for you."
02:28 - So that's kind of the ultimate goal
that I may do a couple videos from now.
02:31 - OK So let me come over here
come over here and let's see.
02:36 - So first of all.
02:37 - So I'm going to start to
implement some of this stuff and
02:39 - go over how these functions work.
02:42 - OK So this is my code so far.
02:45 - Yes no absolute scream video.
02:47 - I forgot.
02:48 - Everybody take a deep breath.
02:50 - I need some like calming sound.
02:53 - That's not coming but
I've got that sound effects.
02:57 - OK So this is my code so far one of
the things you'll notice in all of
03:00 - the examples that I've popped not all but
many of the examples that I'm publishing
03:03 - is that even though I'm using the P
five J.S. style methodology structure
03:09 - of there's a set up function which is
kind of like the pages loaded function.
03:13 - There's a draw function which
runs this continuous loop.
03:15 - I actually and use it,
03:17 - calling a function called
noCanvas meaning there
03:20 - is no drawing canvas associated with
this program that I am writing.
03:24 - I am simply writing a program to
03:29 - mess with the web page other elements of
the canvas paragraph headers that sort of thing.
03:34 - So if I were to look at
the output of this page.
03:38 - Which is over here you can see all there
is is a header that says welcome to
03:42 - A2Z week 1
03:43 - Now where is that coming
from? one thing I notice,
03:46 - nowhere in my code do I say
'hey display that on the page'.
03:49 - That's because I actually have that
simply hard coded into the HTML
03:53 - file associated with this itself.
03:56 - So this is something that I'm
going to touch on in this example.
04:00 - Future examples as I wish I put something
in the HTML file which I put something
04:04 - in the jacvascript file and
there's no real answer to that.
04:07 - It's sort of case by case basis and
personal style that sort of thing.
04:11 - OK but what I want to do first is
just simply show you how can I create
04:16 - a text input on the page.
04:18 - And I'm going to do that
by saying create the input.
04:25 - And I'm going to run this code.
04:27 - Look at that and
04:28 - there it is there is a place where I can
type some text on the page wonderful.
04:34 - Once the user has typed in some
text I want to I want to access
04:37 - that text in my program so
let's look at how I might do that.
04:40 - So first of all this create this input
text box that I created on the screen.
04:45 - I would need to store
a reference to it in a variable.
04:48 - So I'm going to create
a variable like input.
04:51 - I'm going to say input
equals createInput and
04:54 - by the way I'm actually going
to take out the draw() loop.
04:56 - I don't want there's no reason for P5
04:58 - to be continuously looping right now
because I'm not using that aspect of P5
05:03 - which I might later but there's
no cameras there's no animation and so
05:06 - what I now want to do is,
I want to have access
05:11 - to that stuff that's in the the text box
and when do I want to have access to it.
05:16 - I could have access to it in a draw
loop by saying input.Value().
05:19 - I'm going to skip that for right now what I'm going to show you though is just... I'm
05:23 - going to open up the developer tools
here to make this a little bit bigger.
05:27 - So let's say I put my, say I type rainbow into there and
05:31 - then I'd set type input.Value().
05:33 - You can see this by referencing
the variable dot value I have the text
05:38 - that's in there. So anywhere in my code I can simply reference that text box
05:42 - .value() and
I know what the user has typed.
05:48 - So now.
05:50 - I might want to know what they
type only when they hit enter.
05:54 - So the way that I can do that and
I've done something rather horrific.
05:58 - So well actually no I haven't.
06:00 - On a horrific yet.
06:01 - I'll show you later I'll fix this later.
06:02 - So all DOM elements the text input box
06:07 - being a DOM Element have events associated
with them and when I click on it.
06:12 - It's an event when I
hover my mouse over it.
06:14 - It's an event.  Tere is
an event called changed and
06:17 - there's a P5js DOM library function called changed
06:21 - which allows me to execute a function
when that event has been triggered.
06:26 - So I can say input that changed
new text which means I can
06:30 - just write a function called newText().
06:33 - And I can say console.log(input.value).
06:36 -  
06:37 - So what I'm saying is whenever the input box has changed
06:41 - meaning the user has hit enter.
06:44 - I want to see the results
of that in the in the console.
06:48 - So now if I go back and refresh this page and I type in Rainbow and hit enter.
06:52 - We can see here into I have
Rainbow here if I type in unicorn and
06:57 - enter we can see I have unicorn in there.
06:59 - So now I am accessing the content.
07:02 - Whenever the user types enter and
I might do something like say.
07:07 - CreateP(input.value) createP()
makes a paragraph element on the page.
07:12 - So now I can say unicorn.
07:15 - And I can say rainbow and I can say.
07:19 - Swirly happiness and
07:22 - I'm getting all of those things as
paragraph elements on the page.
07:26 - Now here's a question for you.
07:28 - What if I want to know every time the user types a key not just when they hit enter.
07:34 - But any time anything changes
in that text box itself.
07:38 - This event is not the Changed event and
this is the work I've done something which
07:42 - I really don't like which
is that big name for
07:46 - that event is actually input has a little
bit of so technically what I need to say.
07:53 - Is something like this but I sort of hate
how I've named the variable input and
07:57 - then there's also input.
07:58 - So I want to rename that variable/
08:00 - So I'm going to just call
that you know.. textfield or
08:03 - something and that way we can have
08:08 - less confusing there less confusing I
can I can make us a little more clear.
08:14 - So what I'm going to do now
is say function newTyping().
08:20 - And I'm going to say I'm also going to do create space so let's comment  out that.
08:24 - Let's just forthe moment comment out the changed event.
08:28 - And only have the input event.
08:30 - So now watch what happens U N I C O R N.
08:36 - Anytime I type anything.
08:38 - I'm getting an event and I'm kind of
continuously making new paragraph elements
08:41 - for every keystroke that I type.
08:43 - So maybe what I want to do instead.
08:46 - Just as an exercise here to do something
different is still what if I had a single
08:51 - paragraph element that I altered
the content of every time I take to keep.
08:57 - So here's where this like in Shakespeare.
09:02 - Hamlet.
09:03 - There's an essential question.
09:05 - To be or not to be and
I have a different question for you today.
09:10 - And my question for you.
09:15 - I'm ... maybe I should or should be erasing all of this is a base reference for
09:18 - later but it's too late. ... To select
09:24 - or not to select or
maybe it's just to create
09:31 - or not to create; to select or
to create what I'm saying to you is.
09:39 - When do I want something on my web
page to appear based on code I write.
09:44 - I'm creating a new DOM Element and
now it's being appended to the page or
09:48 - verses, when do I want to have something that exists on the page that I access in
09:53 - my code--  exists in the the raw HTML that I access in my code and manipulated.
09:58 - And here's a case where I'm going to demonstrate to you
10:00 - that what I want
to do is I am going to put in the HTML.
10:05 - file itself.
10:07 - I am going to add a paragraph element and I'm going to give it an ID and
10:12 - I'm going to call it "output".
10:16 - Right.
I'm going to call it output.
10:20 - And you can see that it is empty and
10:22 - what I want to do instead of
saying createP() in my code
10:26 - instead of creating the paragraph element, I want to select this paragraph element.
10:30 - I want to access it so
that as the user types,
10:33 - I want to update what's in it with the
word with the keys that they're typing.
10:36 - So let's do that right now.
10:39 - So how I do that in the code is...
10:45 - So I'm going to do 
leave that in there.
10:47 - So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say...  I'm going to make a variable called
10:50 - "output".
10:52 - And I'm going to say output = select.
10:57 - And then I need to I'm
going to use its ID and
11:00 - the indicator for
an ID is the pound or hash symbol.
11:04 - Select(
11:06 - Output) I think that's the ID gave it
11:09 - And then here now what I
want to do is in newTyping(),
11:14 - I'm going to say output HTML
The HTML function in
11:19 - the P5 Dom library is a function you
can call to access the existing content of
11:23 - a DOM element or place content in it And what I want to do is I want to take what's
11:28 - currently in the text field and I want
to put that in that paragraph element.
11:33 - So let's look and see if this works now.
11:36 - And so as I'm typing cannot
read property HTML
11:41 - of NULL so
I've made some sort of mistake here.
11:44 - Here I am back! and
if you were wondering what was wrong,
11:46 - I forgot to hit command S
11:48 - in my index.html
file meaning it wasn't saved.
11:56 - So now that I've saved it,
11:57 - the code works as expected or
as I want it to.
12:00 - Which is I can say "hello".
12:02 - Every time any character that
I typed here you can see
12:06 - that that paragraph
element is being updated.
12:09 - And now when I hit enter.
12:10 - You can see that I am
also saving that.
12:15 - I have two events that I'm tracking
each key being pressed and pressed.
12:20 - Now a couple of things I want to mention 1 is if you want to have this pre-filled
12:24 - with some text.
12:27 - Then one thing you can do is
you can in this createInput()
12:31 - function you can say this
you know like 'enter your
12:38 - favorite food' or something or
just say like your favorite food.
12:44 - Right.
And I could then say you know
12:45 - blueberries.
12:47 - I love blueberries!
12:49 - They make me so
12:54 - happy  I wish I had a ball of blueberries right now and
12:57 - I just do this sort of
weird Internet thing right.
12:59 - "Blueberry on the Internet."
13:02 - OK so you can seeyou're  going to have
something pre-fill text in there.
13:05 - I could also make this
a text area instead.
13:09 - So what I want to do actually right now.
13:12 - Is what I'm going to do number one
13:15 - is going to show you two things at once.
13:16 - Whereas first of all instead of saying
createInput() I could have actually just
13:21 - put an input element in the HTML
file and you select to access it.
13:26 - You can try doing that as an exercise for yourself and
13:28 - what I'm going to do in
this video is change this.
13:31 - I'm going to actually add a text area and
13:35 - I'm going to give it an ID I'm call it textfield.
13:39 - It's a text area.
13:41 - And you can see now if I refresh this you can see there is now a text area that I
13:45 - can expand over here so if I wanted
to type a paragraph in here and
13:49 - I could also actually
preseed it with some text.
13:51 - Please type a story.
13:54 - And you can see now it says
"please type a story" there.
13:57 - And what I'm going to do is in the code.
13:59 - I'm going to
14:00 - comment this out instead of
creating the input I'm going to
14:03 - say textfield = select() and
14:10 - the ID text field so
I could probably think of better.
14:16 - Blueberry I'm going to call it blueberry.
14:17 - And I'm going to go back to the HTML
and
14:20 - I'm going to say give it an ID
blueberry and I will say:
14:25 - "Tell me about how much
you love blueberries"
14:32 - So that in there you can
see that in there and
14:35 - now you can see this same program works.
14:38 - The only thing is that event
enter is no longer relevant.
14:43 - So in this case I should
probably create. Let's do this.
14:47 - I'm going to go to the I'm going to
actually just create a button element and
14:52 - I'm going to say submit and I'm going
to give that an idea which is submit.
14:58 - And then I'm going to go to my code and I'm to save bar submit and
15:03 - I'm going to say submit =
select submit and by the way
15:09 - I'm doing a terrible job of single quotes double quotes everywhere all of you
15:12 - could argue on the Internet single or
double gquote.I am going to use them both.
15:17 - I don't care...I'm going to say submit.Mousepressed()
15:22 - which is an event new and
I'm going to say new text.
15:29 - So when you click the submit button
15:32 - I'm going to call the new text event
which will create that new paragraph.
15:36 - So mouse press does an event for
when you click on a button.
15:39 - So I should be able to do this and
you can see that dadadadadadaaaa
15:45 - and I can hit submit.
I get this is how much I love blueberries.
15:52 - OK so it's did it twice.
15:53 - Why did it do it twice because I have.
16:02 - Interesting.
16:02 - Maybe when I hit  tab or
something.
16:05 - I have this text field change so
that event is still in there.
16:10 - Maybe it somehow figured out I don't know what I don't know what happened yet.
16:17 - Someone needs to  write a command saved song.
16:21 - OK anyway.
16:23 - I finished with this video.
16:24 - OK So this is the end by the way here's a little exercise technical exercise for you
16:28 - to do and I'm going to show you how to do this as I make some video tutorials about
16:32 - how to manipulate strings but basically the next thing you should think about
16:37 - how could you instead of just
reproducing the exact text.
16:43 - That is.
16:46 - That is in the text area our text
input box right there on the page.
16:50 - How could you manipulate that text. So
how could you show the user
16:53 - back what they've typed but
reverse the order of the characters or
16:55 - reverse the order of the words or replace certain words with their pseudonym.
16:59 - I mean that's you know connecting
to an API or something.
17:01 - So you can come up with some clever
idea this is a kind of a technical
17:04 - exercise that you could try.
17:05 - OK Thanks for watching this video about
how to get text input from the user using
17:10 - input field or
a text area in the next video and
17:13 - actually show you how to load from a file
using load strings or the create file.
17:18 - OK thanks very much.
17:19 - And I'll see you in the next video.
