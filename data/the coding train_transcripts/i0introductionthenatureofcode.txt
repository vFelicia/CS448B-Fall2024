00:07 - okay okay uh good morning or I don't
00:10 - know it's probably not morning for you
00:12 - but it is for me good morning here in
00:14 - this strange place that I am uh okay so
00:18 - um some somehow you found your way here
00:20 - and you're watching this video and um
00:24 - uh I've never done this before I sort of
00:27 - have done this before but I haven't done
00:28 - it in a while and I certainly haven't
00:29 - done it with this new fangled setup that
00:31 - makes that where I'm sort of floating in
00:33 - this strange white space um so uh but
00:37 - babbling is probably not what I should
00:38 - do it's a little it's it's not not it's
00:40 - not the best way to start okay so my
00:42 - name is Daniel nobody ever calls me that
00:45 - though uh you could call me Dan
00:47 - schiffman Dan schiffman any variation of
00:50 - of of those uh I teach at a place called
00:53 - ITP and I'm teaching a class uh in two
00:57 - days uh called the nature of code where
01:00 - we look at programming simulations of
01:02 - natural systems and we use this thing
01:04 - called processing to do so so uh for
01:07 - this year for this semester I'm planning
01:12 - hoping uh and and and and and really
01:16 - really uh thinking about and and I'm
01:17 - going to do it because I'm doing it
01:18 - already right now uh recording a series
01:21 - of videos about uh the topics in the
01:23 - course and the students are going to
01:25 - watch these videos I'm also going to
01:27 - meet with the students answer questions
01:29 - something's going to happen with me and
01:30 - the students in the classroom but these
01:32 - are videos now these videos anybody can
01:35 - watch maybe not cuz I I might never want
01:37 - anyone to watch them but if you are
01:39 - watching them then I guess I did let
01:40 - somebody watch this video so what what
01:43 - what I'm you can skip now you can just
01:44 - turn this one off and go to the next one
01:46 - you probably have already but what what
01:48 - I what I'm going to do in this short
01:50 - video which I've already been going for
01:51 - two minutes I want to try to limit this
01:53 - one this one will be a little bit longer
01:54 - I want my videos to be only about 5 to 7
01:56 - minutes each this one might be more like
01:58 - 10 to 15 minutes although I might just
02:00 - shut it off at any moment uh I want to
02:02 - introduce the entire course so I want to
02:05 - kind of talk about what are all the
02:06 - topics we're going to look at go through
02:08 - them quickly and look at a few um
02:11 - examples so uh if you're wondering
02:14 - though let's say you came to this video
02:16 - and you have never seen it you have no
02:18 - idea why you're here and what's going on
02:19 - I'm going to give you even a little bit
02:21 - more of an introduction I'm going to
02:22 - demonstrate oh first of all I have this
02:24 - cup of tea which is sitting over here
02:26 - there's a table I'm in a room by the way
02:28 - it's strange cuz I'm by myself talking
02:30 - to a camera I hope the audio is working
02:32 - otherwise we're going to have to throw
02:32 - this one away and there's a cup of tea
02:35 - here and I I don't want to skill it so
02:36 - I'm going to just for a moment move it
02:37 - over here okay it's it's fine
02:41 - everything's fine nobody worry okay and
02:43 - now I'm gonna um I'm gonna do something
02:45 - I'm gonna walk over here over there is
02:46 - another part of the room and I'm going
02:48 - to hit this button and now I'm over here
02:50 - and I I strangely am floating in front
02:52 - of a a a processing window but this is
02:55 - actually just my computer right in front
02:56 - of me here I can lean over and kind of
02:58 - move this screen around um but I can
03:00 - look at it and talk about this so we're
03:02 - going to be looking at some code here
03:03 - but um first let me just open up a
03:05 - browser so okay so this is ITP if you
03:07 - don't know what ITP is I'm in a room
03:09 - walled off there's sort of a window to
03:11 - the hallway there it's kind of strange
03:13 - somebody might knock and we could say hi
03:15 - to them um but I'm uh this is ITP if
03:18 - you're interested in ITP it's a two-year
03:19 - graduate program we do all sorts of
03:22 - stuff here um you can take a look at the
03:24 - website it. n.edu uh I also want to show
03:27 - you processing processing is the open
03:30 - source like I'm reading this is the open
03:32 - source programming language and
03:33 - environment for people who want to
03:34 - create etc etc etc it's what I'm going
03:36 - to use to demonstrate all these
03:38 - examples this however is not a beginner
03:42 - video series if you've never programmed
03:44 - before you should watch my other video
03:45 - series called I don't know learning
03:47 - processing which doesn't actually exist
03:49 - sort of does there's some draft videos
03:51 - hopefully I'll get to those and publish
03:52 - them as well it's free uh I wanted to
03:55 - say only 9.95 but it's actually just
03:57 - free I it doesn't exist but maybe it'll
03:59 - be free anyway so you should download
04:01 - processing you should take a look there
04:02 - are all sorts of great if you're you
04:04 - know there's a bunch of tutorials here
04:07 - uh you can find a bunch of great books
04:08 - this is uh a really I'm going to duck
04:10 - down underneath this one over here is a
04:12 - really great one to get started with
04:14 - because it's called getting started with
04:15 - processing hopefully I didn't mess up
04:16 - the audio um I would recommend it
04:18 - there's lots of places you can get
04:19 - started with processing now if you're
04:21 - looking for more material text based
04:23 - material to follow along these videos
04:26 - with you can go to the nature code.com
04:30 - wow this is like some weird sales video
04:32 - I going to stop this so this website um
04:34 - you can get the
04:37 - book this book will go along with all
04:39 - these videos um you can also uh get the
04:43 - PDF for free um the book is also just uh
04:46 - if I scroll down here uh and click here
04:51 - um you can see um who and if I shrink it
04:54 - a little bit you can see here's a um
04:55 - table of contents behind me um and you
04:58 - can read the material for the book
04:59 - online as well so there's lots of
05:01 - resources you can get um uh if you're
05:04 - interested in this material that I'm
05:05 - going to just talk about for uh five
05:08 - minute videos over the five minutes and
05:10 - 30 seconds we're pretty good okay so
05:12 - where are we going to start here though
05:14 - uh what is the thing that we're
05:16 - beginning with okay so programming
05:19 - natural systems in processing well one
05:22 - of the things you first do when
05:23 - programming in processing is one of the
05:25 - things you first learn how to do is move
05:27 - a circle across the screen if I had
05:29 - prepared for this I would have an
05:31 - example of a circle moving across the
05:32 - screen to show you right now but I'm
05:34 - just winging it and you can imagine what
05:36 - that would be but um so let's talk about
05:38 - what that is so if you um one of the
05:41 - first things you learn to do is say this
05:44 - xals x + 1 you have some circle you are
05:49 - Circle you're drawing on the screen
05:50 - that's that's what everybody does they
05:52 - make circles on the screen and it has an
05:54 - XY location and it when you say xal X+ 1
05:57 - if you put that in processing's draw
05:59 - Loop Loop right draw over and over and
06:01 - over again looping looping looping it
06:02 - goes up by one it goes up by one it goes
06:04 - up by one we see it here when we see it
06:06 - here then we see it here the illusion of
06:07 - motion is created that's one of the
06:09 - things you learn maybe if you took an
06:10 - intro processing class if you read one
06:12 - of those books if you looked at the
06:13 - website one of the first topics we're
06:15 - going to do in this I don't know what to
06:17 - call this video series this this this
06:20 - television set program show I don't know
06:23 - anyway uh um is uh learn to formalize
06:28 - that and learn to form it using
06:31 - everything's okay just just dro the cap
06:32 - Oops I did it again I did it again okay
06:36 - is using vectors
06:38 - okay topic number one vectors vectors is
06:42 - nothing other than what you've been
06:43 - doing already you have an arrow it sort
06:45 - of says move this from here what is a
06:47 - vector we're going to look at all that
06:48 - we're going to formalize our
06:50 - understanding of motion into vectors
06:51 - which is allow us going to understand an
06:53 - object's location on the screen as a
06:56 - position which has velocity and perhaps
06:58 - even whoa acceleration which is going to
07:00 - be very
07:01 - exciting the key right there I said this
07:03 - word acceleration acceleration is a
07:05 - vector you can think of oh I accelerate
07:06 - a car might it going faster is it going
07:08 - slower am I turning it what's the next
07:10 - step there well if you uh ever took a
07:12 - physics class which I think I might have
07:14 - there's something that's going to trip
07:15 - me here this is kind of hanging there on
07:17 - the floor don't I'm not going to Spill
07:18 - the te with it okay everything's okay if
07:21 - I spill the te I'll pause the video um
07:23 - okay if you ever took a physics class
07:24 - you might have learned something about
07:25 - Newton's law there's this law Force
07:28 - equals mass time acceleration well you
07:32 - can see there's a relationship between
07:33 - acceleration and force and one of the
07:35 - things we want to do is look at modeling
07:38 - forces we're going to look at modeling
07:41 - forces this is our sort of first
07:43 - simulation of the natural world does
07:47 - that even make sense right there is
07:49 - physics in our world so we're going to
07:51 - begin our simulations of natural systems
07:53 - by looking at essentially custom
07:55 - building our own physics engine you know
07:57 - we're not going to to build a fully
07:59 - fledged super awesome amazing bells and
08:02 - whistles Collision detection crazy
08:03 - physics engine we're going to look at
08:05 - basic physics moving options moving
08:08 - objects around the screen with vectors
08:10 - understanding how forces in the
08:11 - environment can affect their motion well
08:13 - why don't we just walk over here for a
08:15 - moment excuse
08:17 - me and just see what I mean by that I'm
08:20 - going to just um I'm going to just look
08:22 - at a couple examples as we're doing this
08:24 - um so if we want to think about forces
08:27 - one thing here's a nice little uh demon
08:29 - rtion haven't I should have run some of
08:32 - these beforehand but um yeah I'd like to
08:34 - make the size of this bigger but um you
08:38 - can see here that we have some objects
08:40 - falling they experience gravity they hit
08:42 - this liquid they experience some sort of
08:45 - resistance drag liquid resistance air
08:48 - resistance friction like thing viscosity
08:50 - there's all sorts of words there we
08:51 - could use there's formulas we're going
08:52 - to get into all that and see how we can
08:54 - model that in code okay so um where were
08:59 - we I lost my pen it's over here uh
09:01 - forces so you know once we look at the
09:05 - basics of motion we have something
09:07 - moving it has a velocity has
09:08 - acceleration we might want to think also
09:10 - about angular motion how what happens
09:12 - when things spin oscillate all sorts of
09:15 - other types of motion related to
09:18 - trigonometry so we're going to spend a
09:20 - few videos looking at oscillating uh
09:23 - oscillation oscillating motion angular
09:26 - motion anything really that has to do
09:27 - with angles and trigonometry if you
09:29 - wanted to know about s cosine tangent
09:32 - review those topics see how they apply
09:34 - in code see how you can make things spin
09:36 - uh move back and forth think of a guitar
09:38 - string plucking a plucking think of
09:41 - plucking a guitar string do you pluck a
09:43 - guitar string I guess you pluck it
09:45 - anyway or a spring bouncing back and
09:48 - forth we're going to look at all that
09:49 - stuff with oscillation I really hope
09:51 - this is working otherwise this is just
09:52 - good practice I'll just do it again I'll
09:54 - probably have to do this again anyway so
09:56 - we're going to look at that oscillation
09:58 - and um I could go pull up an example but
10:00 - you can imagine that for right now the
10:01 - fourth topic on our
10:04 - list particle systems so essentially
10:09 - we're spending all this time
10:11 - understanding the basics of physics
10:13 - building a physics engine how do we
10:15 - formalize understanding of moving things
10:16 - around the screen to really create
10:18 - Dynamic and exciting animations of
10:21 - motion once we get through that we're
10:23 - all that time we're going to be saying
10:25 - look at our little circle woo it's
10:26 - moving the circle is moving around the
10:28 - screen once we get through all that
10:31 - we're going to say Hey what if we want
10:33 - to make lots and lots and lots and lots
10:34 - and lots of those circles so really uh
10:37 - week four week four video four video 12
10:40 - who knows what video it will be on week
10:42 - four of semester whatever this topic
10:44 - number four particle systems is going to
10:46 - be all about understanding how to take a
10:50 - single entity that's moving around the
10:51 - screen how to model a single particle
10:53 - within a system of particles and there's
10:55 - lots of topics that will go with that
10:57 - we're going to spend time really diving
10:59 - into the array list which is a Java
11:01 - class that we'll want to use in
11:02 - processing to manage large numbers of
11:04 - objects we're going to spend time
11:07 - looking at uh Advanced object-oriented
11:09 - programming inheritance and
11:11 - polymorphism um polymorphism meaning
11:14 - many forms uh I don't I really need to
11:16 - write this down here because can you
11:19 - even see that you can't see that right
11:21 - because this is it doesn't exist over
11:22 - here I just move over here and I'm gone
11:24 - but there's a room a whole room it's
11:26 - like a physical place that we are that
11:28 - I'm in by myself with some lights and
11:30 - there's a computer over here okay so
11:33 - um it's probably distracting to talk
11:35 - about that okay um getting used to this
11:38 - okay number
11:39 - five particle systems okay uh well okay
11:43 - so I'm gonna maybe move over to the
11:45 - computer in a moment we'll look at some
11:46 - more examples but number
11:48 - five here's the thing what have we done
11:52 - here we spent all this time kind of
11:55 - figuring out how to make a physics
11:57 - engine but you be aware physics engines
12:01 - exist already there are plenty of
12:03 - examples we're going to look at two
12:05 - we're going to look at something called
12:07 - box
12:08 - 2D and we're going to also look at
12:10 - something called toxic Libs and in
12:12 - particular the
12:14 - verlet
12:17 - physics uh package of toxic livs and
12:20 - both of these libraries you know there's
12:22 - you know there are times in life where
12:25 - you just want to make like your circle
12:27 - move around the screen and change some
12:28 - pretty color and like you just that's
12:29 - what you want to do this afternoon you
12:31 - don't really need to pour through box 2D
12:34 - documentation classes figure it out
12:36 - download a library just for that there
12:38 - are times in life where you have these
12:40 - really complicated strangely shaped
12:42 - jaggedy polygons and you want them to
12:44 - all bounce off of each other yeah that's
12:46 - when you need something like box 2D
12:48 - toxic Libs is another it's fantastic
12:50 - Suite of libraries that does so many
12:52 - things but we really want to look at it
12:53 - for I'm getting my phone is vibrating
12:56 - over there with the timer on it it's
12:58 - like a teer ing on the edge about to
12:59 - fall off of where it's standing but I
13:01 - was saying toxic Libs um toxic Libs is
13:05 - uh really great for um doing a connected
13:08 - systems where you have lots and lots of
13:09 - elements all connected together through
13:11 - spring connections you can model cloth
13:14 - string uh Jellyfish all sorts of great
13:17 - things with toxic lips and we'll see
13:18 - some examples of that um just to show
13:20 - you what I mean by box2d I'm going to
13:21 - come over here for a second and I have a
13:25 - very bad
13:26 - feeling so this is what happens when you
13:28 - don't prepare um uh um I don't have the
13:33 - library installed I'm just going to keep
13:34 - going you can see examples of that this
13:36 - video is going on for way too long
13:37 - anyway I'm going to redo it I'm going to
13:39 - upload it if the people can watch it but
13:41 - I'm definitely goingon to have to redo
13:42 - this video because this is just practice
13:44 - okay so you can think of this as kind of
13:47 - part one of a semester maybe in a in a
13:50 - semester if you were taking a class
13:52 - which you're not or maybe you are um
13:54 - something called like a midterm would
13:57 - come here because the first half nature
13:59 - of code part one so to speak is really
14:02 - dedicated to this idea of modeling
14:05 - physics um because we need a core set of
14:08 - building blocks to start with if what
14:10 - we're ultimately looking to do is is uh
14:13 - think about complex systems systems of
14:15 - many elements that have intelligence or
14:17 - limited intelligence or perception of
14:19 - their environment that when they come
14:20 - together achieve some sort of goal or
14:23 - exhibit the property of emergence or
14:25 - evolve or devel have like the brain with
14:27 - connections we want to start looking at
14:29 - all these other Advanced topics um we
14:32 - need a set of building blocks and this
14:34 - physics engine will become our set of
14:35 - building blocks when we look at um all
14:38 - these other topics which I'm about to
14:39 - kind of just rattle off and list um
14:42 - we're going to use the this these these
14:44 - uh examples of modeling motion to um to
14:47 - use them I kind of there's another one
14:49 - here six I don't know maybe six should
14:51 - go up here I'm not really sure uh
14:53 - steering forces definitely going to open
14:56 - up some of these examples to show them
14:57 - to you so so this I think is one of my
15:00 - personal favorites that makes any sense
15:04 - this's a reason why these videos should
15:05 - only be 5 to 7 minutes long because I've
15:07 - already been going for 15 minutes and I
15:09 - I don't know I feel like I wouldn't want
15:10 - to watch this anymore and I'm I don't
15:12 - want to watch any of it because I don't
15:13 - want to look at myself but um okay but
15:16 - it's too late I'm doing this we're gonna
15:18 - um go through the rest of these topics
15:19 - and and you can um skip ahead to the
15:22 - next video that's you don't have to
15:23 - watch this so but if you like it you
15:24 - could just keep watching um fast forward
15:28 - with your click do you have a clicker um
15:29 - okay so um steering forces here's the
15:33 - thing an important thing that I didn't
15:36 - mention about all of this one through
15:38 - five is we are dealing with this
15:40 - scenario let's here's a scenario for you
15:43 - there is a table there is a circle a
15:47 - ball some sort of little soccer ball
15:49 - beach ball basketball sitting on the
15:52 - edge of this
15:53 - table and oh gust of wind blows and the
15:57 - the the circle just sort of pushes off
15:59 - and falls down and bounces and hits a
16:01 - wall and bounces up right that's we're
16:02 - modeling a physics engine there's
16:04 - collisions there's forces there's all
16:06 - sorts of stuff
16:07 - happening let's consider this scenario
16:10 - there is a ball here but it has a little
16:12 - antenna and little tiny feet can you see
16:16 - that you see my beautiful little alien
16:17 - drawing what if this ball living ball
16:21 - chooses and there's a giant Predator
16:23 - here H big
16:25 - teeth and it's going it's coming at this
16:28 - little alien I'm totally losing my mind
16:30 - I was going at this little alien it
16:32 - chooses to leap off and go this way so
16:35 - there's a very different thing between
16:36 - an inanimate object just sitting there
16:37 - in the world responding to forces and
16:39 - this entity that has life that has
16:41 - desires that's hopes and dreams and
16:42 - fears and goals and wants to make a
16:44 - choice something it could
16:46 - do so uh we want to start looking at
16:50 - that this type of model and the way
16:52 - we're going to do that is through the
16:53 - lens of steering behaviors um there's a
16:56 - great book called vehicles
16:59 - by brenberg um which I refer to in my
17:02 - materials I'll talk about later in a
17:04 - video there's the work of Craig Reynolds
17:06 - um who developed all these steering
17:08 - behaviors for autonomous characters for
17:10 - animations um uh that we're going to
17:12 - look at but we want to say what does it
17:14 - mean for an entity to make a choice to
17:16 - seek a Target to flee from a Target to
17:20 - to to to follow a path in a crowd to
17:22 - flock like a flock of birds to swarm
17:25 - like a collection of bees swarming how
17:27 - do we have an entity do that and we're
17:29 - going to do that by understanding how to
17:31 - calculate steering forces the major
17:32 - difference there is that this ball has
17:35 - no understanding of its environment this
17:38 - alien has a perception of an environment
17:39 - it can see that there's an evil Predator
17:43 - coming at it and it can see that there's
17:45 - nothing down here and it needs to jump
17:46 - to get off of there so um just to for a
17:49 - moment to look at some of these examples
17:51 - what I'm what I'm talking about here is
17:52 - under agents um if I just go really
17:56 - quickly to uh I think a nice
17:58 - demonstration of this is a crowd path
18:01 - following which I will open up very
18:03 - briefly and run it so we want to get all
18:06 - the way to understanding systems like
18:08 - this so you can see here there are a lot
18:10 - of little circles and they have they
18:13 - they have only two they're only two
18:14 - principles by which they live principle
18:16 - number one follow the path so we have to
18:19 - understand how do we Define a path how
18:21 - do we have something follow a path
18:22 - principle number two do not Bang into my
18:25 - neighbor I just want to I just want to
18:27 - have my own physical space I don't like
18:29 - anybody getting too close I just that
18:31 - that's the two principles separation
18:33 - path following so we want to look at
18:34 - what are these steering behaviors and
18:36 - how do we model these forces seeking
18:38 - fleeing arriving wandering path
18:40 - following wall hugging obstacle
18:41 - avoidance etc etc then how do we combine
18:44 - them when we combine them we can get
18:46 - complexity and that is really the key to
18:50 - where we're going in the nature of code
18:52 - I kind of want to say I don't know I'm
18:54 - going to say it in like a scary voice
18:56 - but that do that wouldn't make any sense
18:57 - I need sound to effects be really good
18:59 - to have sound effects of buttons all
19:01 - here I can press those sound effects no
19:03 - okay so uh so that's where we're going
19:05 - so this is really part
19:07 - one part two we can think of as
19:11 - complexity and because I'm already going
19:13 - on for way too long um we we talked
19:17 - about combining steering forces simple
19:19 - local interactions of autonomous agents
19:22 - making all sorts of crazy emergent
19:24 - phenomena happen we're going to look at
19:27 - flocking
19:28 - uh we're going to look also at cellular
19:31 - automata which I'm sure I said
19:33 - incorrectly and maybe I'll learn how to
19:34 - pronounce that um before we get there
19:36 - which is uh a complex system where
19:38 - instead of the elements are moving
19:40 - around they're sitting uh on a grid so
19:43 - what does it mean to have a a system of
19:45 - simple elements with local interactions
19:47 - on a grid and how could that really be
19:50 - linked to all this motion stuff that
19:52 - we've been doing so far um we're going
19:54 - to look at fractal patterns fractal
19:56 - systems how do we design a fractal
19:58 - that's really actually a set of elements
19:59 - moving with vectors could we do that uh
20:03 - and then that's really part two BO I'm
20:05 - just racing through it now and then
20:06 - we're going to get all the way to part
20:08 - three which I'm going to call
20:11 - intelligence and we are going to look at
20:14 - um uh two really uh look my phone must
20:17 - have buzzed again it's really about to
20:18 - fall that's not a good place for it
20:20 - mental not to self don't just rest the
20:22 - phone on top of the camera uh during
20:25 - while making the video okay we're going
20:26 - to look at evolution
20:28 - and modeling evolution in software I'm
20:31 - going to set something running over
20:33 - here uh an examp all this is always
20:36 - going to tie to motion and animation so
20:38 - if we go down here to the genetic
20:39 - algorithm examples and I'm actually just
20:41 - going to click on this one evolve flow
20:43 - field I think this one has a bug in it
20:45 - so it actually might crash but um let's
20:47 - run this for a second oh I didn't press
20:49 - the button I'm just talking okay so um
20:52 - here we are and um you can see here oh
20:55 - there's all these entities almost look
20:56 - like flies just like scattering out in
20:58 - the wind these entities have DNA to them
21:02 - they're they're in they have some sort
21:04 - of principles encoded into them that is
21:06 - their DNA and how they do their DNA gets
21:09 - passed on to a Next Generation uh
21:11 - through through a natural selection
21:13 - algorithm they start the the better ones
21:16 - prop the better ones what's a better one
21:17 - it's trying to get to there this target
21:20 - so they're learning how to go around the
21:21 - obstacles they're learning how to find
21:22 - this path through the system through a
21:24 - process of evolution so we want to look
21:26 - at okay we learned how to make
21:28 - a complex system we'll come back and see
21:30 - how they're doing in a second we learned
21:32 - how to make a complex system like a
21:34 - flocking system how could we actually
21:36 - give those systems the the the elements
21:39 - of those systems make them into a
21:40 - population and have them evolve hooray
21:43 - and then uh the very last topic we'll
21:45 - look at although maybe I don't really I
21:47 - don't really like this topic I don't
21:49 - know if I really understand it but I did
21:52 - write some stuff and make some examples
21:53 - so I guess I'll go through those but um
21:55 - we're going to look at neural networks
21:57 - so what does it mean mean to actually
21:58 - not only put DNA into this animated
22:02 - thing that we put on the screen but
22:03 - actually put a brain into it as well and
22:05 - and and is there something about the
22:06 - human brain the way that the human brain
22:08 - works that we might model in software to
22:11 - some sort of interesting effect let's go
22:13 - take a let's take a look at our friends
22:14 - now it's like a cooking show like we you
22:15 - put them in the oven and now we're going
22:16 - to come back check on them right no it's
22:19 - not we're not cooking okay uh let's take
22:20 - a look here and we can see that they are
22:22 - they've gotten quite further along you
22:24 - can see um they've actually learned to
22:25 - get around most of the obstacles it
22:26 - doesn't look like they've made it to the
22:28 - end yet so um this was my introduction
22:31 - uh I have a feeling I'm going to just
22:33 - walk back over here U that didn't work
22:36 - um I have a feeling that I will probably
22:37 - re-record this video maybe I should make
22:39 - it into smaller Snippets I actually
22:41 - would like to show you example projects
22:44 - of things that people have made with a
22:45 - lot of these topics which I think in a
22:47 - starting video would make sense to kind
22:49 - of get a uh just see get your ideas
22:53 - flowing but um this is a list of stuff
22:55 - that I'm going to go through these
22:56 - videos will never be this long long
22:58 - again this was kind of just practice I
23:00 - wanted to just get this out there I have
23:01 - a list if I could turn the camera I'm
23:04 - out of focus I know anyway but if we
23:06 - could turn the camera over here I have a
23:07 - list of all the videos I want to make
23:08 - for the first day of class um and
23:11 - there's about one two three four five
23:13 - six seven of them they'll be about five
23:14 - minutes each or almost 10 minutes each
23:16 - or somewhere around an hour of content
23:18 - and my goal is to have a place where you
23:21 - can watch them a place where you can ask
23:22 - questions about them a place where you
23:23 - can interact with the code live on the
23:25 - page there's all sorts of possibilities
23:27 - so
23:28 - um that is the plan I think there's a
23:32 - button now that I go to press and I turn
23:34 - this
23:36 - off right
23:38 - I goodbye I enjoyed
23:42 - this awkward pause come over here
