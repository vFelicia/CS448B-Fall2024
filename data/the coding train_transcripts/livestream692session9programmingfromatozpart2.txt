00:02 - hello I think I am back after a break
00:06 - where I recorded um a couple guest
00:08 - tutorials with Sarah drasner and Val
00:11 - head those will be published sometime in
00:12 - the next week they're super exciting one
00:14 - was about Springs and p5js and one was
00:18 - about uh a framework that I never heard
00:21 - of before today called mo. JS so um if
00:24 - anybody's actually watching this in the
00:25 - chat I'm sorry I'm like very tired it's
00:27 - been a very long day it's about 6:40
00:29 - p.m. I already a two-hour live stream
00:31 - and then recorded uh two guest tutorials
00:33 - and I was doing office hours all morning
00:35 - so this has been kind of an epic
00:37 - adventure of a day um but I really
00:39 - wanted to come back because the uh
00:41 - coding challenge that I started earlier
00:43 - I ran out of time and wasn't able to
00:44 - finish and since I won't be doing
00:46 - another live stream until sometime next
00:47 - week I really wanted to make sure that
00:49 - was finished so that it could be um
00:52 - published Mo in the chat wants a uh
00:54 - shout out otherwise uh Mo will not feed
00:58 - Mo's baby nephew I really don't want any
01:01 - babies to go
01:03 - unfed so I'm going I'm I need to refill
01:06 - this water which was stupid that I
01:07 - didn't do that before I'm
01:10 - starting but let's see how I do so um
01:15 - I'm just going to kind of keep an eye on
01:17 - the chat and my battery level of the
01:20 - microphone um and I'm gonna get
01:26 - started everybody wants shout outs JIA
01:30 - licky wants to shout out oh Australia
01:32 - what time what I would like to know is
01:34 - what time is it has anybody watching
01:35 - this in the middle of the night right
01:36 - now it 640 p.m. I'm not doing my usual
01:39 - introductions that I usually do in these
01:42 - live streams because I did all that in
01:43 - the previous one I did today although
01:45 - probably when these get published to
01:46 - YouTube there'll be separate videos some
01:48 - of you might just be watching the
01:49 - beginning of this but such is life um
01:52 - okay so let me figure out where I was
01:55 - before uh here I
01:57 - am so this is what I ended with with
02:01 - Jacob's going to cry all you guys are
02:02 - really pulling on my
02:04 - heartstrings uh Jacob is going to cry
02:06 - all night if Jacob does not get a shout
02:09 - out midnight in the UK hello UK okay so
02:14 - um this is okay I'm gonna I'm stopping
02:16 - with the shout outs now I'm not g to
02:18 - look at the chat too much um I'm gonna
02:20 - finish up this tutorial so I'm gonna try
02:22 - to figure out where I left off so this
02:24 - is what I have so far I have a uh uh
02:30 - application that allows you to Doodle
02:31 - into a canvas click save and it saves
02:33 - your drawing to a database and then it
02:35 - shows all the drawings that have been
02:37 - saved
02:38 - here okay so I'm now going to Mata if
02:41 - you're watching this now or later um I
02:44 - am going to move into the part where I'm
02:47 - going to just sort of pretend to pick up
02:48 - as if this is one video I don't know
02:51 - how easy or hard that will be but I'm
02:54 - going to give that a try if it has to be
02:57 - um it could be two parts but I think
02:59 - this this will just be like one long
03:00 - tutorial which I think is
03:03 - fine oh um the sorry so um just in case
03:06 - people are new I didn't watch this
03:07 - afternoon I did two introductory
03:10 - Firebase tutorials um this afternoon and
03:14 - those have yet to be published I they
03:16 - were available live and now they're kind
03:18 - of hidden on YouTube in the archives but
03:20 - once those files get cleaned up and
03:22 - edited um there'll be the raw archive
03:24 - and edited versions of those that will
03:25 - appear online and actually something
03:27 - that um I really forgot to
03:30 - mention which is uh retrieve okay let me
03:35 - just once Firebase this should pull it
03:38 - up this I I I should have mentioned this
03:41 - in all of the videos but we'll put it in
03:43 - as a link in the descriptions but this
03:45 - is the reference page uh read and write
03:47 - data on the web so this reference page
03:49 - shows kind of all of the stuff for what
03:52 - I'm doing but there's sort of more to it
03:54 - in terms of all the authentication stuff
03:56 - which I'm totally glossing over ah I
03:58 - should have mentioned that again so much
04:00 - more things to talk about can't get to
04:02 - everything okay and deleting data all
04:05 - that sort of stuff all right I'm
04:07 - skipping I got somay I got to like learn
04:09 - This Promise stuff and do some tutorials
04:10 - about that okay so I'm checking out the
04:14 - chat hello
04:16 - Brazil um okay
04:20 - and I I ran out of water um okay uh
04:24 - while people are oh my God so many
04:26 - people have just joined while people are
04:28 - joining uh um I'm going to refill this
04:31 - water because I really do need I I
04:32 - should have done that before I started
04:35 - uh
04:35 - SoundCloud whoops uh system
04:39 - preferences uh sound multi random
04:43 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
04:45 - itself those numbers aren't related at
04:48 - all you pick like I'm picking random
04:50 - numbers between 0 and
04:53 - 10 1 9 48 9 2 1 3 I pick nine a lot
04:58 - apparently but with pearing noise I
05:00 - might pick numbers like this 2 3 4 3 4 5
05:05 - 6 5 4 5 6 7 five six 7 five 6 s 89 876
05:12 - look this is like pearly noise
05:14 - performance art 9 2 7 6 1 9 4 8 9 2 1 3
05:22 - I think 2 3 4 3 4 5 6 5 4 this is like
05:28 - pearly noise performance
05:30 - 59 2 6 1 9 4 but with curly noise I
05:36 - might pick numbers like this okay I'm
05:39 - back oh did I did I actually put on the
05:41 - correct music I have no
05:43 - idea did I I I have no idea because I
05:45 - couldn't I can't actually hear the audio
05:47 - of what was playing I just funn it
05:48 - through the live stream so I have no
05:50 - idea if that was the this dot song I but
05:53 - we're P that now uh okay welcome to
05:55 - everyone who has just joined I am
05:57 - continuing my tutorial series from this
05:59 - after
06:01 - afternoon I'm hoping this will just take
06:03 - about 15 or 20
06:05 - minutes um it was not sorry everyone oh
06:08 - well hopefully that was um Creative
06:11 - Commons license music wow the the my
06:14 - keying is really off today but what am i
06:17 - g to do I'm gonna move over here that
06:19 - should help a little bit okay so uh I am
06:22 - now here and Firebase console is
06:26 - here boy what's
06:30 - uh and drawings are here and
06:36 - okay so I'm going to go
06:38 - to yeah first thing I want to do is add
06:41 - a clear button
06:43 - okay okay everyone sorry I'm my brain is
06:46 - totally fried as I said before it's been
06:48 - a very long day but I really want to
06:50 - finish this example so I'm just going to
06:52 - dive right into it right
06:55 - now so apologies for to those of you who
06:58 - are just tuning in tonight
07:00 - this I'm continuing example I made
07:02 - earlier today which is a drawing web
07:04 - application that stores drawings in a
07:06 - Firebase database so you if you'll be
07:09 - able to go back and watch the other
07:11 - stuff that I'll publish from this
07:12 - afternoon earlier which will be the
07:13 - beginning part of what I'm going to do
07:15 - now okay so here we
07:19 - go okay so I'd like to add a couple more
07:21 - features to this web application before
07:23 - I finish up one is I need a button to
07:26 - like clear the drawing CU once there's a
07:28 - drawing here there's no way for me to
07:30 - start over a new drawing so the first
07:32 - thing that I want to do is just add
07:34 - another button and I'm going to go to uh
07:37 - index.html and I'll add a button I'll
07:39 - call it a clear
07:41 - button and I'll say clear and then I'm
07:45 - going to refresh the page we see that
07:46 - the clear button is there so now what I
07:48 - need to do is in the JavaScript code um
07:52 - what I need to
07:54 - do uh is find where I'm doing stuff with
07:57 - buttons and I'm going to uh use the same
08:00 - technique by using the P5 Dom libraries
08:03 - function select to select the clear
08:06 - button and then the clear button we'll
08:08 - get an event called clear drawing and
08:11 - remember the drawing is just this array
08:14 - so if I want to clear the drawing all
08:16 - this is like a very simple thing to do
08:17 - and I know I could just put an anonymous
08:19 - function here but for clarity I'm kind
08:21 - of just doing I don't know if it's
08:23 - actually for clarity this might be worse
08:24 - but I'm going to um I'm going to go Dash
08:27 - to the bottom of my code and write this
08:29 - call back function clear drawing and all
08:31 - I need to do there is reset the array to
08:35 - nothing so now uh I can uh Draw
08:39 - Something Right dot do dot I can hit
08:41 - clear I can start over smiley face I can
08:44 - hit clear I could load up one of these
08:46 - drawings I could hit clear and start
08:48 - over or I could load this and I could
08:50 - start up on it so you're starting to
08:51 - think there's a lot of possibilities
08:53 - here of some kind of Exquisite corpse
08:54 - style collaborative drawing editing
08:57 - thing so you know I don't have color
08:59 - don't have there's so much you could add
09:00 - to this if you want to like build off of
09:02 - this and make some sort of exciting
09:03 - thing I hope you do okay so now we have
09:05 - the clear button what's another feature
09:07 - I want to add well one thing that's a
09:08 - bit of a problem is I'm going to add
09:10 - another drawing I I love hearts so I'm
09:13 - going to just do some more Hearts I'm
09:15 - going to do a drawing with three hearts
09:16 - now watch what happens when I hit
09:19 - save uh it updates the list but and it's
09:22 - really hard to see because again if
09:23 - you're going to work on my work I would
09:25 - rename I would add a name field and add
09:27 - a name for all these but what you're
09:29 - seeing here is that um it's duplicating
09:32 - the whole list again when I add just one
09:35 - so something that I need to do and I did
09:36 - this in another example recently is I
09:39 - want to find where I'm creating that
09:40 - list which is right here and I want to
09:44 - give every one of these elements a class
09:46 - and I'm going to just call it uh
09:49 - listing so uh this I'm going to give
09:52 - this and this is again the P5 Dom
09:54 - library has a class function that gives
09:55 - it a listing class and then when I
09:59 - um when
10:01 - I oh oh I'm sorry I'm in the right place
10:04 - already so this is the part where I
10:05 - create that so before I create it I want
10:09 - to and there's probably a more efficient
10:11 - way to do this um because I could just
10:14 - sort of request from the database just
10:15 - anything new or I could be more
10:16 - thoughtful about this but I'm just going
10:18 - to kind of do this thing where I clear
10:20 - the whole list so um so I'm going to
10:23 - just make a variable called elt for
10:25 - elements and I'm going to do select all
10:27 - and I'm going to say do listing and then
10:29 - I'm going to Loop
10:31 - through uh all of those
10:35 - elements and call the P5 Dom Library
10:38 - function remove which removes the Dom
10:41 - element from the page so before I
10:43 - generate the list I'm going to clear it
10:44 - because I'm going to get all the data
10:45 - from the database again so now we should
10:47 - have I refresh the page we can see here
10:49 - are all my drawings and now I'm going to
10:52 - clear and make another drawing which I'm
10:54 - going to try to make a
10:56 - cube my kids love to draw 3D cubes it's
10:59 - like sort of this like fascinating thing
11:01 - for like little kids okay so I did that
11:03 - I'm going hit save and we can see now
11:04 - that's just there so dynamically added
11:06 - to the page so we really really really
11:09 - gotten far along in a way this is done I
11:11 - could say like okay well I want to do
11:13 - something to add a feature to edit a
11:15 - drawing update a record in the database
11:17 - delete a drawing from the database those
11:19 - are things I'm going to leave for you to
11:21 - investigate you know again all the do
11:23 - documentation for this is at this URL uh
11:26 - firebase.com
11:29 - and right so this is where you can see
11:30 - where these functions on value that sort
11:33 - of thing but what I want to do oh and
11:36 - you know what I realized I did something
11:39 - which I I really should probably change
11:41 - there's two more features one is this is
11:44 - the function I wrote earlier to show one
11:47 - individual drawing so whenever I call
11:49 - ref. on like I did with all the data I'm
11:53 - I'm tying an event to that record in the
11:56 - database forever so if that record ever
11:57 - changes this event will will trigger
11:59 - again and a lot of times you want that
12:01 - but in this case I might want to just
12:02 - only get the data from the database just
12:04 - once and I can actually change this from
12:07 - on to once so once will not tie that
12:09 - event forever but just one time so now
12:12 - I'm going to hit ref oh I'm I'm the
12:13 - wrong page I'm going to hit refresh
12:15 - let's hopefully this still works and you
12:17 - can see this still works but um if I add
12:20 - a drawing it'll refresh the whole thing
12:22 - okay so we're still almost done but
12:24 - something that would be really good to
12:25 - add to this what if I um what if what I
12:28 - want want to do is be is be able to
12:31 - share my drawing with somebody else well
12:34 - right now um the only way to do that is
12:37 - to um is to uh sort of email somebody
12:42 - the ID and then tell them to go to this
12:44 - page and click on the ID what if I could
12:46 - encode into the URL something like
12:49 - question mark ID equals my drawing and
12:52 - so what if each one of those drawings
12:54 - could have a permal link where you could
12:55 - share that peral link and the drawing
12:57 - would show up so here's how I'm going to
13:00 - start doing that the first thing I want
13:01 - to do is just create that peral link so
13:03 - when I'm making these listings in
13:05 - addition to this link that dynamically
13:06 - update to the drawing on the page I'm
13:08 - going to do exactly the same thing
13:11 - again and I'm going to say create a but
13:14 - instead I'm going to say question mark
13:16 - ID equals plus key that's the link and
13:20 - then what I wanted to say is I'm just
13:22 - going to say peral link and then what
13:24 - I'm gonna do so let's do this and we
13:26 - should see now oh and I need to parent
13:28 - it also oh and this should be I'll just
13:30 - call this uh Perma and I'm going to say
13:33 - per. parent Li so it also goes in that
13:37 - list and you can see now you can see now
13:39 - I have the this this and then also these
13:42 - permal links now the spacing is all off
13:43 - so obviously with CSS and thinking about
13:46 - styling and and being more thoughtful
13:48 - about the HTML I'm just going to do
13:49 - something quick which is like Perma do
13:52 - uh style this is a P5 Dom library for
13:55 - adding some CSS Styles I don't know
13:56 - maybe if I just add some padding will
13:58 - that do it
13:59 - make it I can differentiate between
14:01 - those two yeah so now I can see I have
14:04 - the peral link and the actual uh so this
14:07 - is now showing me the drawings and now
14:09 - if I click on one of these it goes to
14:12 - the page but the drawing does not show
14:13 - up but look what happens it Ur it
14:15 - creates a URL query string with ID
14:18 - equals this so I can have the page read
14:22 - that URL query string how do I do that
14:24 - well there's lots of ways you could do
14:25 - it but since I'm using the p5js
14:27 - framework there is a p5js function for
14:30 - this so I'm going to go to the pgs. org
14:33 - reference oops that's the website
14:36 - reference and I'm going to have to look
14:38 - for this uh URL ah so get URL pams so
14:42 - there's three functions here but I can
14:44 - actually just get the parameters that
14:46 - are on the page in an object so if I
14:49 - look at the reference for this all I
14:51 - need to do is call get URL param so I'm
14:53 - going to do that in setup so I'm going
14:55 - to come back here to
14:57 - setup and uh I'm gonna say uh well I'm
15:01 - goingon to do this right at the
15:02 - beginning
15:03 - actually and I'm gonna say pams equals
15:06 - get URL pams with this right and I'm
15:09 - just going to say console.log
15:11 - params so I'm going to go back to the
15:14 - page uh here I am into the the code I'm
15:16 - going to open up the console so I can
15:18 - see it I'm going to hit refresh and you
15:19 - can see this is what came in an object
15:22 - with a field ID which is the key from
15:24 - the database that's all I needed perfect
15:27 - right so um um and you can see that if I
15:31 - delete that from the URL path and just
15:33 - go I'm getting an empty object so what I
15:36 - can actually do here is I can say if
15:39 - Pam's ID
15:41 - exists if that object has an ID then um
15:46 - what do oh first of all this has got to
15:48 - happen you know this has got to happen
15:50 - after I connect to the
15:51 - database so I'm going to do this down
15:54 - here and then didn't I already have a
15:56 - function that's like show drawing
16:00 - right this shows a drawing for a
16:02 - particular key now here's the thing I
16:05 - kind of I should probably give this an
16:07 - argument um so I'm going to put argument
16:10 - here so if I already have the key if I
16:14 - don't have the key right this is a way
16:16 - of having a function optionally take an
16:18 - argument
16:20 - so on the one hand it's an event that
16:23 - comes from that link and it gets the key
16:24 - from the Dom element but I can also just
16:26 - call that function with a key so I can
16:28 - say if I don't have the key
16:32 - then key equals this otherwise though if
16:36 - I just create it with the
16:38 - key and so where do I do that in in in
16:43 - uh I'm sorry in setup right so much
16:46 - scrolling right here if I have an ID I
16:49 - can just say now show drawing with with
16:52 - pam. ID so this should now and let's
16:55 - let's see if this works let's do
16:57 - console.log
16:59 - pam. ID so make sure that this actually
17:02 - goes here so let's just look to the I'm
17:05 - now loading it and it's empty so I don't
17:07 - see anything and I can still oops um all
17:10 - right first argument was an invalid path
17:14 - so I messed up that function somehow
17:17 - let's see uh what happened here um oh
17:21 - you know what it must have arguments
17:24 - when it's as the call back so this
17:27 - didn't work what a nice idea
17:29 - let's um Let me let me actually figure
17:30 - this out and I'm this would make this
17:32 - video a little bit longer but I think
17:34 - it's going to be worth
17:35 - it let's look at the arguments array you
17:38 - can always say arguments to look at what
17:40 - are the arguments for a function in
17:41 - JavaScript whether you've specified them
17:43 - as actual um parameters in the function
17:46 - definition or not so what I want to do
17:48 - is do this click on here ah so the
17:51 - argument it passes it a mouse event so
17:55 - um and uh so the first element is a the
17:59 - mouse event so I can probably say
18:01 - something like if key is not an inst is
18:06 - an instance of this is really silly what
18:09 - I'm doing when I could just write a
18:10 - separate function but um let's see if
18:13 - this works I don't know if that actually
18:15 - is going to work if key is an instance
18:17 - of a mouse
18:19 - event uh let's see what happens there uh
18:22 - oh that worked so what I'm doing now is
18:24 - I'm check I'm using the I'm repurposing
18:26 - the same function for two different uses
18:29 - on the one hand I want to be able to
18:30 - call the function with a key on the
18:32 - other hand I want this function just to
18:33 - happen as part of a mouse pressed event
18:35 - and key when I call it with a key will
18:37 - actually be a key otherwise it might be
18:40 - a mouse event so I'm going to override
18:42 - Whatever It Is by getting it from HTML
18:44 - fit so now we can see I've got the blank
18:48 - object and everything works but I can
18:50 - now go to the peral link which refreshes
18:52 - the page and gets that because the key
18:54 - comes in peral link so every time I
18:56 - refresh this page it comes up with that
18:59 - particular drawing and I could once
19:01 - again
19:04 - oh I'm going to say that
19:08 - again every time I refresh the page it
19:11 - could come up with that drawing and I
19:13 - could add something to it like it could
19:14 - make this a weird alien face or
19:16 - something and I'm going to hit save and
19:19 - now I have all these drawings here are
19:22 - all my drawings I could click on and let
19:23 - me make this a little smaller so you can
19:25 - see them I can click on all the drawings
19:27 - and I have a peral link to all these
19:29 - drawings so how do I control click or
19:31 - option click it'll open in a new no
19:33 - command click it'll open in in a new tab
19:35 - so I'm command clicking on all of these
19:37 - and we can see there's separate pages
19:39 - oop that load these drawings from the
19:41 - database automatically so this really
19:43 - brings us to the end of this tutorial
19:45 - this is a p5js sketch that allows users
19:48 - to create their own drawing uh you I can
19:51 - write a message to you all thank you I
19:53 - was going to try to write thank you for
19:54 - watching and that's going to take me way
19:55 - too long plus my doodling Mouse
19:58 - handwriting is is terrible uh thank you
20:00 - I can make a drawing I can hit save it
20:02 - adds it to the database I can on the
20:04 - same page click between the drawings and
20:07 - I can also get a Perma link so this page
20:09 - anytime I refresh the page starts with
20:11 - that drawing and I could obviously make
20:12 - a separate page I could make a here's
20:14 - what you should do if you're watching
20:16 - this and want to do an exercise grab
20:17 - this code it'll be in the description
20:19 - linked uh the code for this will be
20:20 - linked on GitHub obviously you'll have
20:22 - to create your own Firebase database
20:24 - I'll probably take out the keys I guess
20:27 - but um rework this to make a separate
20:30 - view that shows like a gallery of all
20:32 - the drawings and you know there's been a
20:34 - lot of wonderful collaborative drawing
20:35 - applications on the web I'm thinking of
20:38 - um Aaron coin's sheep Market I think
20:40 - I'll link to that in this video's
20:41 - description as well as you can see as a
20:44 - kind of nice um uh inspiration for this
20:46 - kind of project so uh thank you for
20:48 - watching and I don't know if this this
20:50 - might end up being a long video I've
20:51 - lost my bell but that concludes the
20:54 - databit p5js sketch for saving a drum
20:58 - drawing into a database and having a
21:00 - gallery of drawings example if you make
21:01 - something with this please share it with
21:02 - me on Twitter shiffman uh please share a
21:05 - link in the comments ask your questions
21:07 - in the comments and uh look forward to
21:09 - seeing you in another video tutorial
21:10 - soon okay bye
21:13 - bye okay um how was that
21:18 - everybody
21:20 - um um that was okay yes any questions so
21:24 - it is 700 p.m. I have live stream for a
21:28 - total almost two and a half hours today
21:29 - which is quite a bit but
21:32 - I do need to get going um in the next 10
21:35 - or 15 minutes but um I would be happy to
21:40 - try to answer one or two uh questions in
21:44 - the chat it's very hard for me to like
21:45 - read the chat especially when it's got a
21:47 - lot of people in it but I'll try to keep
21:49 - an eye on it um but while I am waiting I
21:53 - will also just mention again um I want
21:56 - to mention to you guys the processing
21:58 - Fellowship ship since I'm here applic uh
22:00 - processing Foundation is a
22:01 - non-for-profit organization that I work
22:03 - with to
22:06 - um um that develops processing and p5js
22:08 - like it has a wonderful mission
22:10 - statement uh um I'm I'm like too tired
22:14 - to like explain everything about the
22:15 - processing Foundation but we're running
22:16 - a fellowship program and you can read
22:18 - information about it on the website
22:19 - processing foundation.org fellowships uh
22:22 - it comes with a stien to work on a
22:24 - project in the spring so check that out
22:26 - I'm going to look at the questions now
22:28 - uh
22:29 - um I have my own YouTube programming
22:32 - channel can I use this same format as
22:34 - video as you are using also on my
22:35 - channel I don't see why not I don't have
22:38 - any ownership over this idea of using a
22:39 - green screen um so if I can inspire
22:43 - people to think about making V
22:44 - programming tutorials I think that's
22:46 - great and I encourage you to do so
22:50 - um oh do a video showing your studio you
22:52 - know this is like the most requested
22:54 - thing and I keep forgetting to do this
22:55 - so I don't know how to remember or when
22:57 - to carve out the time to do this but you
22:58 - guys should all keep asking me about
23:02 - that I'm looking at the
23:08 - chat it's nice to see all these lovely
23:10 - messages of support I really really
23:12 - appreciate it I'm just
23:15 - checking
23:17 - um my phone here um ah so people are
23:22 - asking about translating the videos so
23:25 - um and also there's a question of where
23:27 - did I learn so let me answer both these
23:28 - questions one is I learned to program a
23:31 - couple different times I did actually
23:33 - learn when I was a kid in middle school
23:34 - I I programmed a little bit in basic and
23:37 - I used the logo programming language
23:38 - Turtle Graphics language this was kind
23:40 - of like in the 80s um and I then really
23:44 - started programming when I became a
23:45 - student at ITP so that's it. n.edu and
23:48 - edu and that's the program where I teach
23:50 - right now um I first discovered
23:52 - processing there uh when um through uh
23:55 - JT nemoy who did a workshop on one of
23:58 - the the first public workshops on
23:59 - processing at ITP in 2003 and also Amit
24:02 - pataro who taught a class called code
24:04 - and me at ITP and those were some of the
24:06 - first instances of processing and then I
24:08 - started like working with processing
24:10 - from from seeing their work and just
24:12 - never stopped um what do you recommend
24:16 - to start with what programming language
24:18 - this is um oh this is a great question I
24:22 - don't have an answer for it so the
24:24 - answer is whichever one looks good to
24:25 - you um I think doing JavaScript is great
24:28 - because you can publish your stuff on
24:29 - the web really quickly python is a super
24:31 - friendly language uh processing has tons
24:33 - of video tutorials that I've made and is
24:36 - a great Community especially if you're
24:37 - interested in art and visual design and
24:39 - processing is built on top of java so
24:41 - all of these things I think are great
24:42 - choices but really if you've just found
24:43 - one that you like and you found a
24:44 - tutorial or a book or a friend who's
24:46 - willing to teach and work with you then
24:48 - that's the one you should use
24:50 - um um oh oh translating and captions I
24:54 - know I'm sorry that I'm missing some of
24:55 - your questions and I will try I apolog
24:58 - olog for that but I one day I'll get a
24:59 - system for maybe getting these things
25:01 - submitted in advance then I can kind of
25:02 - read through and moderate them better so
25:04 - one thing I'll mention on YouTube is you
25:07 - can um I don't know how to oops pull
25:09 - this up I'm going to open up my channel
25:13 - but um if you're looking for um so this
25:17 - is me live right now if you're looking
25:19 - for a way to contribute um or you have a
25:23 - way that I could actually even like pay
25:24 - for this kind of service in a kind of
25:26 - reasonably priced way I would love to
25:27 - have all of my videos captioned in
25:30 - English um to make them more accessible
25:32 - as well as translated to other languages
25:34 - and you as a user can actually submit
25:36 - captions online and I have a link I'll
25:39 - put it in this video um I think if
25:41 - you're on a video there's a place I have
25:42 - it enabled where you can just I don't
25:44 - want to look for it right now where you
25:45 - can just add a caption um so uh and
25:49 - YouTube has an interface for you doing
25:50 - that so please if you want to do that
25:52 - you all have permission to do that I
25:54 - mean I'm getting the benefit of that so
25:55 - you might thank you for volunteering but
25:57 - I also don't want to ask too much of
25:58 - people's time just to volunteer and do
26:00 - something for me for free so if you
26:02 - think you want to spend a lot of time
26:03 - doing this and want to get in touch I
26:05 - figure out a way to do that what that
26:06 - makes sense too but I definitely take
26:08 - voluntary uh
26:11 - contributions um ah watched your giit
26:13 - videos how do I merge branches with
26:17 - conflicts very very very very very very
26:21 - carefully um there's not really I don't
26:23 - really have a great answer to that I
26:24 - definitely need to do a video sort of
26:25 - demonstrating that um when I have a
26:27 - conflict what I do is I actually open up
26:29 - the files manually in a text editor and
26:31 - I kind of like just go through it
26:32 - manually do my detective work to figure
26:33 - out what went wrong and they'll usually
26:35 - show you here's code it'll be like
26:37 - there'll be these weird like lots of
26:39 - like dashes and extra characters that
26:41 - are part of the indicating there's a
26:43 - merge conflict here and if you edit that
26:45 - file and clean it up and then do another
26:47 - uh commit that's kind of the way I work
26:49 - there are tools that help help you with
26:50 - this but that's generally the way I do
26:53 - it
26:54 - [Music]
26:56 - um um if you one were to translate what
26:59 - series do you recommend I guess I prefer
27:02 - people to start with the beginner series
27:04 - that I have and my beginner playlists
27:06 - are um these JavaScript ones one through
27:09 - six and then these as well and then the
27:11 - learning processing ones so a lot of
27:13 - these have been captioned already um but
27:16 - any of these I'm you know it's kind of
27:18 - if one interests you and you feel like
27:19 - watching it then you might as well
27:20 - translate it uh or caption it and
27:23 - English don't you know translating is
27:24 - great but it often the reason why I ask
27:26 - for English captions is it also makes
27:28 - the translator's job so much easier if
27:30 - there're already English captions so if
27:32 - I could get everything English captioned
27:34 - then people can translate it more
27:36 - easily um oh I did so um dyslexic clama
27:40 - I don't have no idea if I'm now asks can
27:42 - you do a GitHub for beginners video I
27:44 - have that so right here I I wish I had a
27:46 - better way for people to find my videos
27:48 - but here on my uh Channel I have G and
27:51 - GitHub for poets and these are total
27:53 - beginner introductions to get in GitHub
27:54 - you don't need to know anything about it
27:56 - whatsoever and I have more to do but you
27:58 - can see these are these are some of my
28:00 - lesser watched videos um so that I'm
28:03 - certainly encourage you to watch that
28:07 - um have you made a tutorial on how to
28:10 - install p5js that's a great question
28:13 - Scott um this is a tricky question
28:15 - because unlike processing which really
28:18 - is a desktop application that you run um
28:20 - even though it also processing is also
28:22 - just a library for Java p5js is just a
28:24 - library for JavaScript so there's
28:26 - actually nothing to in install because
28:29 - you can code it in any text editor
28:32 - coding environment whatsoever um let me
28:34 - go to the p5js
28:36 - homepage and show you what I mean by
28:38 - that so if I go to download this
28:40 - download will U will download all of the
28:44 - library files and an example project but
28:47 - will not come with a code editor so this
28:49 - example project is something that you
28:50 - just need to open in Sublime Text Adam
28:53 - editor text edit notepad anything and
28:56 - then run like a wet web server to like
28:59 - see the result in your browser and I
29:00 - have a couple videos that demonstrate
29:02 - how to do that on a Mac at least and
29:04 - you'll find tutorials also on the p5js
29:05 - uh wiki page there's a website and wiki
29:08 - page for running a local server if you
29:10 - Google like local server p5js those will
29:12 - probably come up you can also get the
29:14 - individual Library files and then there
29:17 - is also an actual editor so this is an
29:19 - editor that you can download and run as
29:21 - an application and it will have it will
29:23 - sort of like make your project for you
29:25 - and has a little play button that will
29:26 - launch like a little browser window but
29:28 - don't get you should not be misled by
29:30 - the fact that uh you don't need this to
29:33 - do JavaScript programming but this is a
29:35 - place that makes it easier to get
29:36 - started I'll also mention that coming
29:38 - soon we're going to release a web editor
29:40 - you just go right to a website sign up
29:42 - for an account and write p5g code right
29:44 - on in a browser itself so that's that's
29:46 - come kind of coming soon and phasing out
29:49 - some support of this desktop editor
29:51 - until we've got a web better in shape
29:52 - and maybe we can return back to
29:54 - it um so that's kind of my answer to
29:56 - that question you can also use codepen I
29:58 - think I did a tutorial about codepen in
30:00 - p5js at one point and there's lots of
30:01 - other um web editors as
30:04 - well um I do have a cellular automata
30:08 - Conway Game of Life video already um I
30:11 - would love to do that again though um so
30:14 - uh okay so it's um I tend to use adom
30:16 - editor um sometimes I use Sublime and I
30:19 - use the p5js editor I use everything I I
30:21 - I love the processing IDE I mean you
30:23 - can't do JavaScript you can do
30:24 - JavaScript in it so here's another way
30:26 - you could do it h let's let me show this
30:27 - to you real quick quick because Ben fry
30:29 - made this and this is going to take me a
30:32 - minute because I think I want to make
30:34 - sure I have the latest processing I
30:35 - don't think I do I really I can't bear I
30:38 - cannot bear to um I cannot bear and by
30:42 - the way processing is a non-for-profit
30:44 - foundation so feel free to uh we'd love
30:46 - to if you're if you're able to to donate
30:48 - to help support fund these projects um
30:51 - to processing which will prompt you when
30:52 - you go to download I'm going to download
30:55 - um this version and let's see oh it's
30:56 - coming in real fast um oh brackets is
30:59 - great too sorry that's a great example
31:01 - of a of an editor I've used that as well
31:04 - um okay so I'm going to show you
31:05 - something that was um you should thank
31:07 - Ben benor Fry on Twitter for this
31:10 - wonderful thing that he did uh which I
31:12 - have actually not tried yet so this is
31:14 - exciting and I probably should make this
31:15 - like a video tutorial but I'm too tired
31:17 - it'll just be found here in the archive
31:18 - of this live stream um so I'm going to
31:21 - move this to the desktop here replace
31:24 - and I'm going to run the latest version
31:26 - of processing
31:28 - I have no idea what's going to happen
31:29 - this is exciting ah yes I want to open
31:31 - this so processing by the way is a Java
31:35 - uh is a uh there's so much to say about
31:36 - processing processing.org I'm too tired
31:39 - to talk anymore okay so I'm gonna open
31:42 - up actually I'm not going to open up an
31:43 - example I'm going to go here processing
31:45 - has modes so you can actually in
31:47 - processing which is Java based it also
31:49 - has a python mode which allows to write
31:51 - your code in python as an Android mode
31:53 - which allows you to publish your
31:54 - processing sketches to Android and I'm
31:55 - going to add this add modee P 5gs mode
31:58 - so this is another way you can work on
32:00 - p5js sketches I'm going to add this
32:04 - mode and hopefully it'll install I hope
32:06 - this
32:07 - works I'm going to switch to p5js mode
32:11 - and look at this it already put in
32:13 - function and draw oh it has an index on
32:15 - HTML this is amazing oh my God _ Fry on
32:19 - Twitter this is
32:21 - awesome uh I'm going to just write some
32:23 - code create canvas
32:25 - 400400 and uh uh background zero
32:31 - ellipse um actually you know what I'm
32:32 - going to get I'm just gonna I'm going to
32:34 - just go copy paste something so I'm
32:35 - going to get my pho taxes Pho taxes
32:38 - example
32:40 - um which is under coding challenges in
32:43 - my GitHub repo uh challenges Pho taxes
32:47 - p5js
32:49 - whoops uh sketch. JS raw let me copy
32:53 - paste this copy paste this here hit save
32:57 - uh
32:58 - Pho I'm just going to put this on the
33:01 - desktop testing p5js
33:06 - mode and now I'm going to run this what
33:08 - happens when I hit play look at that
33:11 - that is fantastic so it may runs a
33:13 - little L local server and if I were to
33:15 - do something like just to change
33:17 - something real quick like let's um I
33:22 - don't know change the size of these
33:25 - ellipses and give them a little bit of
33:28 - Alpha and hit save if I refresh this
33:31 - yeah and now there you go so who
33:34 - hopefully I'm not hypnotizing everything
33:36 - so that's great I should use this more
33:37 - in like video tutorials um this is fun
33:40 - what happens if I have an
33:43 - error it's worked somehow I don't know
33:46 - maybe I didn't hit save I'll have to
33:47 - investigate this more but that's so
33:49 - great to
33:50 - see okay so um now it's been a half an
33:53 - hour I've been over two and a half hours
33:55 - today I do need to get home and get some
33:57 - sleep I have two classes doing their
33:59 - final project presentations I probably
34:00 - have a zillion emails from students with
34:02 - questions so I'm going to take a look at
34:04 - those and get home thanks for tuning in
34:07 - everything that I did today will be um
34:10 - published
34:12 - um will be published on my channel so
34:15 - subscribe if you want alerts about that
34:17 - um it'll come in the next week I expect
34:19 - to do a live stream again next week but
34:21 - I don't know what day yet and I will
34:23 - announce these things on Twitter at
34:25 - shiffman and I also do have an email
34:27 - list that I sometimes send announcements
34:29 - too um which you can sign up for at
34:31 - coding rainbow.com and of course if you
34:34 - also want to support the work that I'm
34:35 - doing absolutely only if you feel so
34:37 - inclined I do have a a patreon that
34:40 - you're welcome to uh subscribe to if you
34:42 - feel so inclined but I'm just glad that
34:43 - you're watching and that you're here and
34:45 - maybe if you give some feedback whether
34:47 - it's good or bad in a in a nice and
34:49 - constructive way I also appreciate that
34:51 - okay so um I will see um I will see okay
34:56 - so I'm going to answer three quick
34:57 - questions I plan to do neural network
34:59 - tutorials this spring my studio is not
35:02 - in my office uh at NYU I teach at at pp.
35:06 - n.edu it's here at the school for poetic
35:08 - computation which is an independent
35:09 - Artist Run school called sfpc doio if
35:13 - you're in the New York City area the
35:14 - show of the students work is actually
35:16 - happening this weekend so you should
35:17 - come and check it out and what version
35:19 - of processing.js does Khan Academy use
35:21 - so I'm not exactly sure about this KH
35:23 - Academy has their own staff of
35:25 - developers who handles this stuff I'm
35:27 - pretty sure they use something called
35:29 - processing.js I know that's very
35:30 - confusing this was a project started
35:32 - originally by John Rig and it's another
35:34 - it's a JavaScript version of processing
35:36 - that actually has hooks in it to autot
35:38 - translate your processing code to to
35:41 - JavaScript um I don't know if they're
35:42 - shifting to p5g I'm curious I'd be
35:44 - curious about that as well the both of
35:46 - them both environments are great and and
35:47 - I know that processing.js has worked
35:49 - really well for them okay uh GitHub is a
