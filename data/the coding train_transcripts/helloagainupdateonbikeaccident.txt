00:02 - hello I hope you can hear me I don't
00:05 - know if anybody's there and I hope I
00:08 - will see some chat messages coming
00:10 - through this is not an episode of the
00:13 - coding train sorry I'm typing my
00:15 - password on this other computer over
00:16 - here do I have to press this to see the
00:20 - chat let me see
00:21 - oh no I see messages there oh hey I am
00:24 - hi hi yes so I wanted to do a video to
00:29 - say hello I'm sorry that it's been about
00:30 - two weeks since I've actually done a
00:33 - video I don't have a plan for this I
00:35 - should have made a list of all the
00:36 - things to talk about
00:37 - hello Boston hi hi hi I have seen so
00:39 - many wonderful chat messages I can't
00:41 - believe they're already 202 people here
00:43 - so if you didn't see on Twitter or
00:46 - wherever else I might have posted this I
00:48 - unfortunately had a was in a bicycle
00:51 - accident I was the one riding the
00:52 - bicycle the bicycle accident was with
00:55 - the street and mostly my elbow and I'm
01:01 - trying to figure out how to look at you
01:02 - where's the camera if I look over there
01:04 - that's me looking at you yes that's the
01:05 - camera so this happened almost a week
01:11 - and a half ago and just to let you know
01:16 - so this arm is pretty much broken mostly
01:19 - in the elbow is the major area of
01:21 - destruction this wrist is also broken
01:25 - it's possible this wrist is broken but
01:28 - it's pretty stabilized will probably
01:30 - heal anyway even if it is I had surgery
01:34 - on this elbow to have the elbow put back
01:39 - together there's some now some metal in
01:40 - my arm I believe I might have been just
01:42 - in a fog of a days but I think the
01:44 - surgeon said they put some artificial
01:45 - bone that's made out of coral in my arm
01:49 - and so I'm wondering if the universe is
01:52 - trying to tell me something about
01:53 - machine learning first of all I know
01:55 - this is totally askew I will try to get
01:57 - a better set up to do video streaming
01:59 - for my remember I'm at home no no I I
02:02 - think I've done one lie
02:04 - stream from the park and everything else
02:05 - has been from my studio and but I don't
02:11 - know if you guys remember the first time
02:12 - that I started to do a video about
02:15 - machine learning I said I did say
02:22 - something something's in machine
02:23 - learning and the fire alarm went off
02:24 - then I just got started with my machine
02:27 - learning videos and once I just got
02:32 - started with that then I went to one day
02:34 - of the O'Reilly artificial intelligence
02:37 - conference which was really
02:40 - extraordinary I went toward this
02:41 - wonderful reinforcement learning
02:42 - workshop and I'm forgetting the fellows
02:45 - name who ran the workshop but anyway and
02:48 - then right after that workshop as I was
02:50 - riding a bike to go to a dinner that's
02:52 - when I had accident if you're just
02:54 - joining late you can see I have some
02:56 - injuries here so so anyway so I don't
03:03 - know what the universe is trying to tell
03:05 - me about this coatings the code code
03:08 - machine learning stuff but I will get
03:11 - better I was wearing a helmet his first
03:12 - thing I should say should so this is the
03:14 - very beginning of a video this video
03:15 - please wear your helmet my whole lip was
03:17 - split my tooth is messed up my clap
03:20 - these glasses were actually totally
03:22 - broken I should go get my helmet hold on
03:25 - a second I'm gonna go get my helmet to
03:27 - show you the scratches you can look at
03:28 - this is my favorite poster of this is a
03:32 - poster of all every single bird of North
03:34 - America the complete collection the
03:36 - chair in my apartment yeah talk amongst
03:38 - yourselves for one second Oh get my
03:39 - element
03:39 - [Music]
03:47 - here's here's a unicorn for you to look
03:49 - at oh you can't see the unicorn here
03:50 - there we go can look at the unicorn
03:53 - while I go get my helmet
04:09 - [Music]
04:11 - guess coming back now I loop the helmet
04:18 - okay here's the helmet let's see if we
04:23 - can find the part that's all scratched
04:26 - up it's actually doesn't look like much
04:28 - I don't know if this will come through I
04:30 - don't if you can see those scratches and
04:34 - scrapes on the side of the helmet that
04:37 - is the side that hit the ground I assume
04:40 - I did not lose consciousness or I did
04:44 - have a head CT scan which was negative
04:46 - so all right and yes a cell of the bride
04:50 - in the chat is say get a new helmet so
04:52 - if you didn't know this which I did no
04:53 - helmets are only good for one crash is
04:55 - kind of like car seats same thing for a
04:58 - kid's car seat so sorry for every who's
05:01 - bored by this that you sorry I need to
05:06 - get a new helmet although I to be honest
05:08 - with you I think it might be a while
05:10 - before I ride a bicycle again certainly
05:13 - in the city yeah I do need a shape it's
05:16 - gonna be a while before I if I did get
05:18 - the glasses fixed which is what I was
05:20 - talking about so people are asking a
05:23 - little bit more about the accident
05:26 - there's not really a great story to this
05:28 - but I will I guess I'll tell it's and
05:30 - people are interested I was riding in
05:34 - Midtown which I don't usually do I kind
05:35 - of only ever ride along the West Side
05:37 - Highway bike path because I'm a little
05:40 - bit afraid of riding in the city which
05:45 - makes sense so I was riding in Midtown
05:49 - and there was a street where the bike
05:51 - lane had as a lip like the bike lane was
05:53 - not in the same level as a street and I
05:56 - went out of the bike lane down the lip
05:58 - to go around something I said believe
06:01 - there I think there was a car park it
06:02 - kind of happen is sort of fast and I
06:04 - said I don't totally remember and then
06:06 - when I turn to go back in the bike lane
06:08 - and kind of like avoiding traffic and
06:11 - kind of going quickly I just wasn't
06:12 - careful and didn't really pay attention
06:14 - actually I think I was never in the bike
06:16 - lane first when I turned onto the street
06:18 - and that's partially why I didn't
06:20 - noticed the lip I was just not in the
06:22 - bike lane because I had to go past a car
06:24 - went into the bike lane if I had just
06:25 - stopped like pip walk the bike up and so
06:29 - I don't really know what happened that's
06:30 - what I don't really remember yeah I
06:32 - think I would say so then I just fell
06:35 - sideways I assumed I had my whole right
06:37 - side of the body hit the ground because
06:38 - the elbow must have been what hit first
06:40 - and was shattered this wrist must have
06:43 - tried to brace myself and then what the
06:44 - you know hit my lip was cut and glasses
06:46 - were smashed in the side of the face was
06:48 - also hit so anyway so that's the story
06:53 - there's not really and then actually
06:55 - some nice the cars started to stop big
06:56 - to say are you okay and I was kind of
06:59 - dazed and not really sure I kind of
07:00 - pulled the bike out of the street and
07:02 - like got to the side and leaned against
07:03 - the post but a very nice man stopped and
07:07 - offered it was a city bike so it's a
07:09 - bike sharing service offered to take the
07:10 - bike back helped me get I had some
07:13 - tissues in my backpack helped get those
07:14 - out for me so I could like put them on
07:16 - my lip which was bleeding quite a bit
07:18 - and then helped me on my phone find the
07:20 - urgent care the nearest urgent care
07:22 - which I that walks to because I really
07:26 - actually thought oh I just cut my face
07:28 - and I probably bruised my arm I guess I
07:31 - can't go to this dinner I was going to
07:32 - go to but that'll be a nice excuse to
07:34 - not go to the dinner but then once I got
07:36 - to the urgent care and it was quite
07:39 - obvious that the main tire I mean I you
07:41 - nobody wants to see these photos but
07:43 - there was like a swelling and my elbow
07:45 - that was you know rivals the size of
07:48 - this helmet
07:49 - it was quite big I mean we're talking
07:51 - about a large mango kind of sized a
07:53 - swollen elbow anyway so all said and
07:58 - done I'm fine
08:01 - and but I have to go on hiatus a little
08:05 - bit unfortunately in terms of the kinds
08:08 - of videos that I typically make I cannot
08:10 - type really right now I don't really
08:12 - have use of I mean I have some use of
08:15 - this arm I'm trying to be very minimal
08:18 - about it because the goal here is for
08:20 - this to heal on its own without having
08:21 - to have a second surgery on this wrist
08:24 - and I should know more I have another
08:26 - many life is just full of doctors
08:27 - appointments these days but I have an
08:31 - appointment with a sir interestingly
08:33 - enough of course the surgeon started
08:35 - talking to me about machine and using
08:37 - machine learning do you know recognize
08:42 - do diagnoses and medical inventory and
08:45 - stuff like that so that was kind of
08:46 - conversation I was having with my broken
08:48 - elbow in and out of surgery okay so so
08:54 - I'm trying to figure out what to do a
08:55 - couple things I'll mention I'm seeing a
08:59 - lot of wonderful messages scrolling past
09:01 - messages of support which I appreciate
09:05 - and at some point I'll stop and try to
09:07 - read some of these messages and answer
09:08 - questions but I'm going to kind of
09:09 - continue to ramble for a minute a couple
09:11 - things one is now the nice time for you
09:15 - to support the processing foundation
09:17 - processing foundation org while I'm on
09:21 - break if you're looking for something to
09:22 - support if you want to become a patron
09:26 - through my patreon coding train oh no
09:30 - sorry patreon.com slash coding train if
09:33 - someone could post that link if maybe
09:34 - they're somebody watching who's got
09:35 - admin privileges to post a link in the
09:37 - chat you still can
09:39 - I'm gonna put it on pause for one month
09:41 - so they'll be one month of pledges that
09:43 - I won't take because I feel like it
09:45 - there's gonna be at least four weeks of
09:46 - losing making videos and but then so you
09:51 - can join and it probably it'll it'll be
09:53 - on pause for that first month but I
09:55 - welcome people to join and you'll still
09:57 - still get an invite to the slack
09:58 - community and everything that I've been
10:00 - sort of growing around the channel what
10:04 - else do I want to say I do have a couple
10:07 - people who might hopefully work out to
10:10 - do some guest videos and so the guest
10:13 - videos where will the guest video Oh
10:20 - Kurt in the chat saying Kyle McDonald is
10:22 - doing a p5.js computer vision workshop
10:24 - in Berlin that's interesting um you may
10:26 - see a couple guest videos I I could do
10:30 - like you know I'm some live streams just
10:33 - from my apartment like I'm doing right
10:35 - now and answer some programming question
10:37 - I had an idea to do some kind of like
10:38 - office hours something but you know I
10:41 - I'm loathe to create something overly
10:44 - complicated because I just have enough
10:47 - stuff to kind of keep up in the air but
10:51 - I I also was thinking that I would just
10:54 - get that random numbers book just live
10:56 - stream all day and read somebody
10:57 - suggested this actually I can't remember
10:58 - suggested this I'm sorry if it's choppy
11:00 - it's my iPad on a home internet
11:02 - connection
11:04 - [Music]
11:07 - yeah and I can definitely do live stream
11:09 - Q&A I'm gonna go sorry I've been
11:11 - actually open up this this computer
11:12 - keeps going to sleep I have a secre
11:14 - computer to the side of me here I'm
11:18 - going to check okay all right there
11:25 - doesn't look like anything here okay so
11:28 - I I'm looking at the slack channel see
11:30 - anything posted there so that's pretty
11:31 - much it I wanted them to mention
11:32 - something about the patreon - which is
11:36 - in terms of the patreon rewards there's
11:39 - a reward I can't write on actually I can
11:43 - type better than I can write on a
11:44 - whiteboard right now unfortunately this
11:46 - is my left hand so if this were my right
11:48 - hand I might be able to write on the
11:49 - left hand but this this arm I shouldn't
11:52 - you know I mostly I have it in the sling
11:53 - and completely immobilized but you can
11:57 - say I'm all kind of like still cut up on
11:58 - the hand and stuff here so that this arm
12:02 - is I can't really use it all so okay so
12:10 - I want to mention something about the
12:13 - patreon o rewards which is that if you
12:16 - decide to join the patreon that those
12:20 - rewards can take up to six months to a
12:22 - year for me to get to I have somebody
12:24 - helps me with this but I mostly just
12:25 - ship them out you know every few months
12:27 - I'll have a cup of day to just like get
12:29 - a bunch of books together and put them
12:30 - in packages so if and I know that if
12:33 - people are interested in the book the
12:34 - actual thing is that other rewards and
12:36 - getting them you should just buy them
12:37 - directly rather than join the patreon
12:40 - but I will you will get them it just it
12:42 - also like the actual expense of getting
12:44 - the book and shipping it you know
12:48 - it really costs as much as somebody
12:50 - backing the channel for like five to six
12:52 - months so depending on where you live
12:54 - around the world so anyway so that's
12:57 - also another reason why I might do you
13:02 - guys hear a lot of noise I'm seeing
13:03 - places okay so let me try to have some
13:05 - of these questions how soon will you get
13:06 - back to your regular coding videos I
13:09 - hope you have an update on that next at
13:12 - the end of next week so I have an
13:14 - appointment with the surgeon they're
13:16 - gonna take off what's on my arm right
13:18 - now and have another look at it and put
13:20 - something else on it
13:21 - and I'll hopefully have a better sense
13:22 - of the scheduling then Timothy is asking
13:28 - tell me about the accident this would be
13:29 - archived and I'll leave this online I
13:31 - won't put ads on it or anything and so
13:35 - you'll be able to watch that where I
13:36 - talked about the accident so my arm
13:39 - really does itch I'm sorry this stream
13:42 - is terrible I thought I'd have such a
13:46 - good Verizon FiOS connection at my house
13:48 - but I guess not so I apologize for that
13:51 - wonder if this iPad isn't so great at it
13:53 - um do i watch much youtube and if so
13:57 - what channels I don't watch much YouTube
14:01 - actually I think it's a kind of old
14:04 - fogey thing but I do watch I've been
14:06 - watching this three blue brown calculus
14:09 - videos and I watched some of Suraj's
14:14 - I watched most of all Suraj's videos I
14:17 - watched the happy cats videos so I guess
14:19 - they do watch a lot of YouTube okay oh
14:23 - great I'm glad that people are saying
14:25 - the quality is fine I dunno computer
14:28 - file I haven't watched very much
14:34 - reading the chat to look for more
14:37 - questions do I watch Tom Scott's videos
14:42 - I've heard the name but I have not
14:44 - watched Tom Scott's videos can I do some
14:49 - videos about could you can you do some
14:51 - videos about you and your history with
14:53 - coding I could do that so I could just
14:55 - do some like talking videos I'm not
14:57 - really like production value of video
15:00 - editing kind of person so it's just
15:05 - gonna be rambling me rambling like this
15:07 - which I don't know if anybody really
15:08 - wants to watch but I know like a fun fun
15:12 - function I also watch and I know that he
15:15 - does these great like musings and just
15:17 - kind of talking but I feel like they're
15:18 - just tightly thought out and planned and
15:21 - edited and high-quality I don't know if
15:24 - I'm really capable of that okay are you
15:30 - in pain somebody asked yes it's painful
15:34 - but it's not so bad I mean it's it's
15:36 - it's and it's much it's getting much
15:37 - much better now so I did but especially
15:40 - after the surgery the surgery was my I
15:41 - didn't really realize this as surgery as
15:43 - much worse or more difficult to recover
15:45 - from than accidents itself the accident
15:48 - was kind of just like little scary and
15:50 - weird and they wrapped everything up but
15:52 - I was kind of feeling okay but once I
15:54 - had the surgery that my whole right side
15:56 - is really I've had a lot of soreness and
15:58 - pain and so I and the pain you don't if
16:00 - we're gonna have to have a lot of
16:01 - physical therapy high tech games how far
16:07 - was it for me to walk to the urgent care
16:09 - I think it was probably if I had to
16:11 - guess half a kilometer quarter of a mile
16:15 - something like that
16:19 - I haven't been out much I go for I live
16:22 - near on Central Park which is lucky and
16:24 - I go for I've been going for walks there
16:25 - which has been nice is my pink book
16:30 - written in Java or JavaScript so one of
16:32 - the things that I'm really sad about is
16:34 - this month I mean that in a way this is
16:37 - a lucky time for me I'm not teaching
16:38 - such a summer time I've had to adjust
16:42 - travel plans I can't do some of my
16:43 - travel plans but I'm not really missing
16:46 - out workwise this is a low-stress of
16:49 - time for me to just relax at home and
16:51 - heal but because I had this time period
16:53 - of some extra time on my hands I was
16:55 - going to really work on finally
16:57 - finishing up the new chapter ten and
17:00 - second edition of the nature of code the
17:02 - pink book and I know that's gonna be
17:04 - difficult for me to do anybody has any
17:08 - ideas
17:09 - oh the ideas for things that I could do
17:11 - or ways that you could help I'm totally
17:13 - open to that but so anyway the pink book
17:17 - is written in Java all the examples
17:19 - reported to JavaScript that's the nature
17:20 - of code book and I'm was I'm planning I
17:24 - was planning to have a second edition
17:25 - done by the end of this summer and I
17:27 - don't know that might be a little bit
17:28 - I'll learn es6 that's perfect so I was
17:31 - thinking of doing like video course or
17:34 - reading actually what I would really
17:36 - love I this is gonna this is a little
17:39 - bit ironic that I I think I prefer to
17:42 - learn by reading books over watching
17:44 - videos but if anybody has suggestions
17:49 - it's hard for me to read a book that
17:50 - have to flip the pages but I can read on
17:52 - the Kindle really easily so programming
17:55 - books may be around creative coding
17:58 - machine learning math algorithms what
18:02 - some would say um yes six maybe I should
18:06 - learn like react or something I don't
18:07 - know I shouldn't learn react that's a
18:09 - bad idea I should do anything that's
18:11 - useful so but if you guys have
18:14 - recommendations of that that I can read
18:16 - on the Kindle that would be useful tweet
18:21 - me at Schiffman is the best way to give
18:22 - me your recommendations
18:26 - I could do a video on book
18:27 - recommendations myself and then hi Chris
18:36 - and then do I play video games normally
18:41 - not really I used to the video games I
18:45 - used to play actually if you guys are
18:46 - resourceful you could find an old near
18:49 - Times article about me I had to guess
18:52 - maybe we're talking 2003 about my video
18:56 - game playing there's been two new york
19:00 - time you can find two New York Times
19:01 - articles about me one was also - no we
19:03 - did the video game one is more like 2001
19:07 - there's another one about some artworks
19:09 - that I made in 2003 which I am less
19:11 - excited about find that old New York
19:13 - Times article tweeted at me can retweet
19:16 - it I my I think my name anyway I had a I
19:19 - played on this Bungie was this company
19:23 - that I guess now it makes halo and was
19:26 - bought by Microsoft but I played there
19:28 - early games was a myth the Fallen Lords
19:31 - was the game that I played the most also
19:34 - marathon anybody played these games
19:37 - these were old all times okay all right
19:44 - oh and I do have some exciting news to
19:47 - report which is that the new music video
19:51 - progress is being made on the new music
19:53 - video so that I actually shot the music
19:56 - video already which is really lucky cuz
19:58 - I did all sorts of ridiculous stuff in
19:59 - the music video that I would not be able
20:01 - to do now with all my broken limbs Wow
20:04 - Josh found one of the articles art what
20:06 - if Jackson Pollock were a PC so that is
20:09 - one of the articles there's another one
20:11 - if you could find it I think it's at
20:13 - least two years earlier it's written by
20:15 - Michelle Michaels or Michael Michelle I
20:19 - met him I was at a game conference at
20:22 - the Javits Center just as like a fan and
20:24 - he started asking me questions about
20:26 - gaming anyway
20:30 - old-school Bungie that's exactly right P
20:32 - Dahl 6:15 hi I don't know who you are
20:35 - but you're toast that's it
20:36 - is it still online I don't know who you
20:39 - are but you are toast you're toast
20:40 - that's it bye age is 43 and my birthday
20:44 - is July 29th coming up soon so anyway I
20:48 - think I started answering the question
20:49 - of when do I expect to be making coding
20:52 - videos again I was certainly told I sort
20:55 - of had the sense from the doctors that
20:57 - by the fall I would be able to teach my
20:59 - classes without too much of an issue
21:01 - I mentioned that I do a lot of writing
21:02 - on a whiteboard but I'm hoping you know
21:07 - if I had a goal for myself would be
21:08 - beginning of August but we'll see if
21:10 - that's realistic or not what do I think
21:17 - about MATLAB MATLAB looks awesome to me
21:19 - I don't know it very well you know a lot
21:26 - of Oh eggs and yogurt calcium that is
21:29 - good advice I was actually wondering
21:30 - that what's good for bone healing I was
21:32 - told protein is good too I do eat a lot
21:34 - of yogurt I do have kids that's why I
21:37 - have this is my daughter's unicorn
21:40 - stuffy it's about my own they're not
21:45 - here right now I'm actually home by
21:48 - myself
21:48 - I just finished a puzzle no this is a
21:52 - puzzle that I did with my kids last
21:53 - night that's sitting over there I'll
21:55 - show it to you a puzzle that we did
21:58 - together but glitter puzzle glitter
22:04 - princess 100 pieces 100 pieces is the
22:06 - perfect like puzzle for a six-year-old
22:09 - there's a wand here too I don't have my
22:13 - pal just like pull a rabbit toys anyway
22:18 - okay do I know any working pitch
22:21 - detection algorithm for processing hmm
22:26 - I don't I'm trying to think if if the
22:29 - processing sound library does that next
22:32 - challenge
22:32 - Tetris JavaScript without canvas that's
22:34 - really interesting I would probably I
22:39 - would probably do was I gonna say I
22:45 - would probably I probably do it with
22:47 - Kansas do you think VR programming will
22:51 - be in high demand oh hey Kyle Greenberg
22:56 - Kyle has helped me a lot with this
22:58 - channel Kyle is a researcher than ITP
23:00 - alum where I teach he was just there in
23:02 - the chat
23:04 - ancient history found that article what
23:08 - was I just talking about a brain I was
23:11 - talking about I can't remember now
23:15 - oh the code Tetris coding challenge
23:17 - loved to do that Tetris yeah oh we heard
23:20 - games yeah you know the nice thing about
23:22 - this I think this is an S but on as much
23:24 - of a delay this live streaming has less
23:26 - of a delay than the usual setup I have
23:27 - so VR programming so if what the
23:32 - students are interested in and kind of
23:34 - hyped up about at NYU is any sign there
23:38 - is certainly quite a bit of activity and
23:40 - interest and excitement around
23:43 - storytelling and related interactive
23:48 - experimental works with VR now I think
23:51 - Gabe who I work with an ITP has said
23:53 - this but he likes to think of the field
23:55 - more like experimental cinema or 360
23:58 - cinematic VR is maybe a small piece of
24:01 - what's happening with video and the
24:03 - ability to manipulate video and work
24:05 - with video in new and environments and
24:10 - immersive environments you know arv our
24:12 - 3d etc but I think that you know a skill
24:15 - certainly in that it's something that I
24:19 - would love to learn and get better at is
24:20 - working with environments like unity and
24:22 - unreal engine and different environments
24:23 - like that where you can do programming
24:27 - well I really never get to follow that
24:29 - chat so it's I don't get to see as much
24:30 - of the troll ish messages
24:34 - make a PNG to ASCII code challenge
24:37 - please that's a great idea
24:39 - hello to India would you prefer C++ or
24:42 - Python actually that's another thing I
24:44 - should do I should just learn I should
24:45 - read a Python book and learn Python I'm
24:48 - not sponsored by Khan Academy or anybody
24:51 - so right now this channel is independent
24:53 - I do
24:55 - get support from New York University in
24:58 - a kind of informal way and I use a room
25:00 - there that's and I help oh and you know
25:03 - what some have another guest video
25:05 - that's actually I got a so I think there
25:07 - could be some guest videos coming which
25:08 - would be nice I would love that Peter
25:11 - Peter says I wrote a Python book if you
25:14 - have a Kindle version of it that would
25:15 - be ideal I think I can read a PDF on a
25:17 - Kindle there's no such thing as VR
25:23 - programming just to camera projection
25:24 - made matrices yes I think that's
25:26 - probably accurate or am i able to shave
25:30 - not really I mean I probably could but
25:33 - it would just be so awkward it's not
25:34 - worth it I can brush my teeth I could
25:37 - eat so fond Julius ask is there a slack
25:41 - channel for the coding train there is a
25:42 - slack channel it's currently closed only
25:45 - to patreon subscribers right now that
25:47 - doesn't preclude anybody from making
25:48 - their own community slack channel but
25:50 - that's one of the ways that I am using
25:53 - crowdfunding to raise a little money for
25:55 - the work that I'm doing is to use a
25:59 - patreon too for membership to the slack
26:01 - channel there is also a discord there's
26:03 - also a discord that that I don't know
26:05 - too much about but that's the thing that
26:06 - I know there's a community using
26:08 - quaternion I should look oh I can't get
26:11 - I can't really get up and run and do my
26:12 - joke I feel like I should just always
26:17 - have my cast in this I can't I don't
26:20 - have this gooseneck thing that the iPad
26:21 - is on I just okay Nick Tucker asks what
26:28 - role does AI play in medicine it's
26:32 - interesting question I I can't claim to
26:35 - have any factual expertise in this
26:37 - whatsoever but you know certainly if you
26:40 - think about image classification
26:42 - and how how often doctors and medical
26:46 - professionals use images to make
26:50 - diagnosis or read data from you know
26:53 - echocardiograms you could imagine that
26:56 - if you have I mean I'm really
26:57 - speculating here with again without
26:59 - knowledge of health care industry or
27:00 - anything but I could imagine a scenario
27:03 - where you had a large data set you know
27:06 - of broken arms images of broken arms and
27:10 - then you had an unknown image and you
27:14 - could say we had a lot of images of non
27:16 - broken arms and you trained an image
27:18 - classifier to recognize broken versus
27:20 - non broken arms
27:21 - so and that's a kind of simplistic way
27:23 - of thinking about it but I think you're
27:25 - probably a lot of other ways to think
27:27 - about that do I have a Raspberry Pi yes
27:32 - I have wanted to do Raspberry Pi coding
27:37 - tutorials they just haven't gotten
27:38 - around to it I don't have much to say
27:43 - about Bitcoin people are asking if they
27:47 - can in turn I am definitely accepting
27:50 - help with things but I'm a little bit
27:52 - good it gotta be pretty self-directed so
27:55 - if you want to like poke through all my
27:56 - github repositories and just look at
27:58 - github issues I'm trying to like answer
28:00 - some emails and I'm using actually
28:02 - dictation on the iPad which has been
28:04 - working quite well for me to respond to
28:07 - things but so I'm definitely accepting
28:12 - all help
28:16 - do you think we live in a matrix good
28:20 - question
28:21 - what if what if I told you I do the
28:23 - answer to that question okay is web
28:32 - development in high demand in the East
28:34 - Coast I would say so okay any thoughts
28:43 - on coding boot camps no I don't know too
28:48 - much about them I mean I think it's
28:50 - great they're great
28:54 - let me Nicholas asked what would you
28:56 - like help with let me think about that I
28:57 - guess and maybe I can let me think about
29:02 - that honestly just like we thought about
29:05 - it all right so I think maybe all this
29:09 - has been 30 minutes so I think I'm
29:11 - probably going to get going soon and
29:19 - thank you for all the nice comments the
29:23 - tweets I've gotten the messages I've
29:24 - gotten it's been really nice and
29:27 - supportive all all things consider this
29:29 - is a pretty minor accident and the grand
29:31 - scheme of things that happen in the
29:34 - world and I'm doing just fine and I have
29:35 - really nothing to complain about and if
29:40 - people are interested in me coming on
29:43 - and doing a livestream like this is just
29:44 - answering some questions I'm definitely
29:46 - happy to do this pretty often and if I
29:50 - guess the thing that could be useful for
29:52 - me is to think about is there kind of
29:55 - like a low-key way that I can generate
29:58 - content or answer questions or do stuff
30:05 - while I'm kind of waiting for this stuff
30:08 - to heal
30:09 - so thank you for tuning in the ping-pong
30:16 - a I tweet have I seen I haven't looked
30:19 - through all the tweets that I've gotten
30:20 - in the last week and a half yet so I'm
30:22 - going to go back and do that and what's
30:26 - my favorite restaurant
30:32 - big fan of Japanese food and there are
30:35 - some very delicious very expensive
30:38 - restaurants there's a place that I went
30:40 - to what's it called oh my god it was so
30:44 - good oh I can't have to look this up do
30:49 - you guys want to wait for me to look
30:50 - this up look it up on my other computer
30:54 - I should also check the slack channel
30:55 - here justly okay uh let me see where
31:04 - it's that it's on like West 44th or
31:09 - something
31:10 - oh no East 44th it's like right by Grand
31:14 - Central Station
31:16 - Natsumi no no that's a place that I go
31:20 - to downtown
31:27 - hold on it's gotta be a list
31:30 - [Music]
31:33 - I don't know I can't remember this
31:36 - huh all right I can't find it does
31:41 - anybody watching no people are really la
31:43 - I love that I could see a real-time
31:44 - amount of audience here I will find out
31:48 - what this restaurant is and I will let
31:49 - you know in the next live stream trip
31:50 - you are you're desperate I do live in
31:52 - New York City yeah people are offering
31:56 - I've said some people offer to do like
31:58 - guest videos that I upload to the
32:00 - channel it's not Nobu I do I mean no
32:02 - booths amazing but Sokka goroh could be
32:07 - that that sounds right how come I can't
32:10 - rember they named this I want to say
32:11 - that it starts with an M so I teach at M
32:16 - as well New York University go to ITP
32:19 - NYU edu and that is a two-year master's
32:23 - program that's part of Tisch School of
32:26 - the Arts it's part of New York
32:27 - University and you can find out more
32:29 - information about that program if people
32:31 - are student applying or visiting you're
32:33 - always welcome to and I hope that I'll
32:36 - be better to teach our teaching three
32:37 - classes three classes in the fall
32:41 - I love I think Python is awesome I wish
32:43 - I knew it better and did more with it I
32:46 - have lived in New York since 1995 so not
32:49 - always I gotta find out what this
32:53 - restaurant
32:56 - who love sushi is it not by Grand
32:59 - Central
32:59 - it is a Grand Central your I just look
33:11 - Oh sushi Yasuda I think it's yeah yeah
33:17 - yeah 204 East 43rd Street I think this
33:22 - is it sushi Yasuda I just had one meal
33:29 - there at the sushi bar that was like
33:30 - totally totally amazing I do not own a
33:33 - bike this happened on a city bike and
33:36 - yeah have I ever been to Europe yes I
33:39 - actually lived in London for eight
33:44 - months pretty recently in 2015 I did a
33:47 - semester at NYU London and I would love
33:50 - to go back to the UK and spend some time
33:52 - there I really had a wonderful time
33:54 - there found it to be a very enjoyable
33:56 - place to live and it was nice to be not
33:59 - that things are supposed to be away from
34:02 - I never mind I get it to American
34:05 - politics and I was 2015 so but it was
34:08 - just nice to be away for a while from
34:11 - this crazy country okay
34:20 - I'm Rita just reading the chats pretty
34:22 - interesting to read all your messages
34:24 - make community project so we can code
34:27 - together that would be an interesting
34:29 - thing to do
34:30 - I would love to that could be an
34:35 - interesting thing to have some community
34:36 - projects and they could make them as
34:41 - sorry I'm getting a text message from my
34:44 - mother she's apparently not watching
34:46 - this Oh somebody asked about guest
34:50 - videos so I might try to do some guest
34:52 - videos I prefer to have a kind of pretty
34:55 - strict durational creation of them and
34:58 - actually have them with guests working
34:59 - in with me here in New York but if
35:03 - people make coding tutorials what I'm
35:05 - not opposed to doing is making a curated
35:07 - list of them and then doing like a live
35:09 - stream that has a video that links to
35:10 - like other people's tutorials to like
35:11 - watch this week so like a kind of like
35:13 - highlight reel of like hey these are
35:14 - things you could read or watch this week
35:16 - or something or like a you know this
35:19 - week in creative coding type thing I
35:21 - feel like there have been some things
35:22 - that have happened recently that I
35:24 - wanted to mention there was a medium
35:26 - post about the new p5.js web editor I
35:29 - did hurt both arms this the right arm is
35:32 - unfortunately much more serious and had
35:34 - surgery and it's gonna be a letch longer
35:35 - recovery than this is just a broken
35:36 - wrist but but it's quite difficult to
35:40 - the surgeon actually asked if you wanted
35:42 - me to do you gave me the option of
35:44 - having surgery on both and I opted not
35:46 - to have surgery on this one and hope
35:47 - that it heals on its own so we'll see
35:50 - okay so um private lessons I don't a
35:56 - little I want to I'd love to help people
35:58 - and I mean I guess teaching at NYU is
36:00 - essentially my form of private lessons
36:03 - for students who are in that the p5 web
36:06 - editor I'm sorry I see a question I
36:07 - answer and then I lose my train of
36:08 - thought one thing I might try to do is
36:11 - do a live stream and maybe matcha who
36:14 - helps me with stuff or somebody else in
36:16 - the patron group and the slack channel
36:18 - can be like a moderator and just give me
36:20 - kind of like a curated list of questions
36:21 - and keep track of them and I can answer
36:23 - them
36:23 - at a time because right now I kind of
36:25 - read the chat and talk and then I
36:26 - stopped hi there were two questions I
36:28 - was answering and I forgot what both of
36:30 - them were how long did learn to take me
36:34 - to code well I started really coding
36:36 - probably in a serious way in 2001 so 16
36:42 - years and counting would be my answer to
36:44 - that question okay so I was saying so a
36:47 - couple things as I could do like a High
36:49 - Line you know I could do like here are
36:51 - some recommended things to look at this
36:53 - week video the other thing is I'm
36:55 - encouraging people to in terms of news
36:57 - in the world of stuff that I work on is
37:00 - to check out the processing foundations
37:02 - medium account and there's a post about
37:07 - the p5.js web editor which hopefully
37:09 - will that be more publicly released soon
37:11 - but there's less information that post
37:14 - is written by Cassie who I'm hoping to
37:16 - sometime this summer have come as a
37:19 - guest I should talk to her about this
37:21 - first maybe we could do a little bit of
37:22 - like a launch of the web editor with
37:24 - some videos for processing okay so I
37:30 - think this is like really by the way
37:32 - this is really enjoyable I want to thank
37:34 - you guys for there's 473 people watching
37:37 - lots of really nice comments a few
37:39 - people are like please stop talking or
37:41 - you're boring but you know that that
37:42 - goes with the internet territory I can
37:44 - take it it's not so bad
37:46 - and I actually this is really I kind of
37:49 - lifted my spirits in a really nice way -
37:51 - I mean I'm not actually seeing anybody
37:52 - or talking to anybody but just like
37:55 - having the nice messages and feeling
37:57 - like I'm making a video and I'm online
37:59 - on YouTube again I have felt a little
38:01 - you know it's not so pleasant to feel
38:04 - like it can't entirely take care of
38:06 - yourself and I can't exercise in the way
38:08 - that I'm used to and I can't work in the
38:09 - way that I'm used to and it's hard to
38:11 - just kind of enjoy the sort of forced
38:13 - vacation you know vacation is nice but
38:15 - forced vacation especially when it
38:17 - involves pain and surgery is not so
38:19 - great either but I'm doing again All
38:21 - Things Considered I'm smiling happy
38:24 - summer it's beautiful day in New York I
38:26 - think what I'm gonna try do is go for a
38:28 - walk after I finished this video and I
38:31 - will not be able to play clappy bird
38:32 - that's correct
38:33 - I don't I cannot clap this is my best
38:35 - attempt look doesn't it look like this
38:37 - hand is a completely different color
38:39 - than this hand this all bruised so I
38:43 - think that's still the bruising I mean I
38:44 - don't want to show you the gross thing
38:46 - but if I were to show you under my
38:47 - armpit it's all red and black and purple
38:49 - and bruised and it's really quite
38:51 - something but you know and so fake hand
38:57 - yeah the other guy unfortunately is just
39:00 - New York City Street
39:01 - it was just being the street that
39:03 - collided basically I wish I mean I wish
39:05 - I had a better story not that I want to
39:07 - get hit by a car or something but so a
39:09 - lot of you are asking what happened I
39:11 - this video is now about 40 minutes long
39:13 - it doesn't hurt it's difficult to change
39:15 - t-shirts
39:16 - yeah changing shirts is not easy hey got
39:20 - a testing reply to my mom so let me see
39:22 - here let me at least read what that
39:24 - message is and also I'm not really doing
39:28 - a good job ask questions and Twitter
39:30 - select something to do create Q&A
39:32 - sessions that could be 15 minutes long
39:33 - do mix social media with YouTube so you
39:36 - can grow your followers this is not for
39:37 - my mom this is for somebody of that
39:38 - Patriots lacks channel by other option
39:43 - could bring someone into code yeah pair
39:44 - programming oh that's an interesting
39:45 - idea I think would be some funny high
39:47 - jinks there could be some good shtick
39:50 - tell me see this message oh she's asking
39:55 - about my tooth I okay I went to the
39:56 - dentist today because this tooth is sore
39:59 - and a little bit loose but they x-rayed
40:02 - the tooth and it is just gonna heal on
40:04 - its own and it looks like so my tooth it
40:06 - should be fine
40:10 - okay so I think that's it I could keep
40:14 - going on and on maybe I can you know
40:22 - maybe mild concussion there was no head
40:25 - trauma I had a CT scan but it's sort of
40:28 - unclear I had a bit of a headache for a
40:29 - couple days but I mean it didn't seem
40:33 - I'm pretty lucky in that respect
40:35 - okay so again I wanted to end on a
40:38 - positive note which was how nice this
40:40 - has been to see your comments and to be
40:45 - able to be live and making a video again
40:47 - even though there's really not anything
40:48 - in this video but me rambling I am
40:50 - definitely happy to do this once a week
40:52 - I do have people are asking I do have
40:57 - good health insurance I'm very lucky
40:58 - this is not something that everybody has
41:00 - and there's something that I really
41:01 - believe everybody should have and should
41:03 - have easy and free possibly I don't want
41:07 - to get into this but I believe health
41:09 - care is a human right let's just put it
41:10 - at that but I'm very lucky to have good
41:13 - health care through my job at NYU and so
41:15 - I haven't had any issues on that front
41:17 - which is again just part of this
41:22 - kind of privileged existence okay so um
41:26 - thank you everybody
41:28 - and um now that I ended on my on that
41:34 - note I will I don't know maybe I'll just
41:39 - come do some live streams every was so
41:41 - often don't go I I don't know what else
