00:00 - hello happy May 4th I'm gonna do Cody
00:04 - challenge for May 4th on the coding
00:08 - spaceship this Cody challenge I'm going
00:11 - to make some scrolling text that looks
00:13 - as if it is scrolling off into the
00:15 - distance and it is the return of the
00:18 - 15-minute timer which when has that ever
00:22 - gone wrong I mean it's always been so
00:24 - great to have the time for nothing if it
00:26 - goes wrong with the timer
00:27 - so um why am I doing this challenge
00:29 - today it's I don't know it's the 4th of
00:31 - May and I thought it might be
00:32 - appropriate and maybe someday I'll get a
00:34 - sponsorship and then I'll be able to you
00:36 - know have all these logos and music
00:38 - happening at the same time ok here we go
00:43 - let's start the timer and let's begin
00:46 - all right so I'm gonna do this in
00:48 - processing processing is a Java based
00:50 - programming environment if you were
00:52 - anybody else or if you were born after
00:53 - 1990 you would probably do some kind of
00:55 - like CSS transforms and have some crazy
00:58 - cool 3d text scrolling thing in the
01:00 - browser I'm old and I'd like to draw my
01:03 - pixels one at a time so here we go let's
01:07 - make a window that is let's just start
01:11 - with like 800 by 600 and let's let's
01:14 - just admit the fact that we're going to
01:15 - be doing this in 3d and I'm going to add
01:17 - the p 3d renderer then in draw I'm gonna
01:21 - say background 0 oh and I need some text
01:23 - hmm
01:24 - so let's make a text file but first let
01:26 - me save this and I'm gonna call this I'm
01:29 - gonna just say this is the desktop under
01:31 - May 4th challenge and I'm just checking
01:40 - the chat because I'm gonna need help
01:41 - definitely gonna need help I'm at 14
01:43 - minutes ok and don't get distracted
01:46 - don't get distracted ok text edit on the
01:49 - e key still doesn't work on this
01:51 - computer so many things going wrong
01:52 - format plain text so let's get some text
01:54 - I am using in this coding challenge
01:57 - processing org and so I don't know this
02:01 - looks like some good text oh yeah this
02:04 - is great let's look at this let's use
02:05 - this okay so I'm going to save this as
02:12 - I'm gonna go to the desktop and I'm
02:14 - gonna go to May 4th challenge and I'm
02:16 - going to go to space dot txt no e on
02:22 - fingers ok there we go
02:25 - so now in back in my sketch here I want
02:28 - you access that text so I'm going to
02:31 - create actually I'm gonna create a
02:35 - variable I'm gonna call it a txt I don't
02:38 - want to call it text because there's a
02:39 - function called texted processing and
02:41 - just so I don't confuse myself and once
02:44 - I'm gonna use the load strings function
02:46 - and I'm gonna load look at I call that
02:51 - file space space dot txt but the thing
02:56 - is you might be wondering here I really
02:58 - don't have time to explain I'm going to
03:00 - anyway why do I have this array of
03:02 - strings called lines well it so happens
03:03 - that the load strings function loads a
03:06 - text file and takes every line from that
03:08 - text file it makes it a separate element
03:10 - in an array and this is actually very
03:12 - convenient in most cases but not so much
03:14 - right now
03:14 - so I am then going to instead say
03:18 - actually this might actually be really
03:20 - useful because I might I might want to
03:22 - make use of that array but right now I'm
03:23 - just gonna say T XT equals joint lines
03:27 - lines dot join and then I will join them
03:32 - with the line break character and join
03:36 - I'm going to join them with the line
03:38 - breaker lines that join hmm maybe I need
03:40 - to give it double quotes because it's
03:41 - not a character it's a string no oh
03:45 - let's check our errors cannot invoke
03:49 - join string on the type of string array
03:51 - oh oh right let's do this this is a
03:56 - processing function that exists lines
03:59 - that's called join that's written into
04:02 - processing there's no join function for
04:04 - an array in Java I guess and the join
04:09 - function is part of the processing API
04:11 - where I can take an array and join them
04:13 - with a line break ok now we are going to
04:16 - say a fill 255 because I want my text to
04:20 - be white on a black background then I'm
04:22 - going to say text
04:25 - txt and I'm gonna say I'm gonna give it
04:27 - a bounding box of the full window and
04:30 - let's just run this and see what we got
04:33 - okay there we go there's our text it is
04:36 - in this window there it is alright let's
04:38 - do some stuff I really should think
04:40 - about the font oh I didn't even think
04:42 - about this do I have time to go look for
04:44 - the appropriate font for this particular
04:47 - simulation that I then I'm attempting to
04:49 - code without buzz marketing for free a
04:52 - particular commercial process is really
04:55 - pointless what I'm attempting to do here
04:56 - oh it's a single anyway text font Oh
05:02 - text size let's just try text size
05:04 - sixty-four okay I also want to use it
05:09 - that's pretty good I also want to use
05:11 - text align and I want to full justify
05:15 - that's not gonna work let's try Center
05:17 - just out of curiosity what does that do
05:19 - uh it centers it okay centers it within
05:24 - that box well let's we use that for
05:25 - right now okay we're doing well what is
05:27 - I got 10 minutes I have time to eat some
05:29 - melon there's gonna be really weird I
05:31 - I'm so confident about this code
05:33 - challenge this piece of melon which
05:36 - you're wondering what is the deal with
05:38 - this piece of melon it's purple it's
05:40 - blue this is the magical space melon
05:44 - that they eat on the planet ma Phooey
05:49 - that's the only planet I know
06:03 - delicious very good very low pH soothing
06:07 - of the throat okay sponsored by alien
06:15 - melon okay now what I want to do is I
06:19 - need a variable I'm gonna say I was
06:22 - about to say let but I'm in processing I
06:24 - need to specify the type float y equals
06:26 - zero lets you let's set the text at zero
06:29 - comma Y and let's say Y minus - so Y is
06:34 - just going to change by one every frame
06:38 - and now we have scrolling text where'd
06:44 - it go oh look at this
06:45 - I gave it a bounding box which was the
06:47 - high OH
06:49 - this was gonna be a no edit this is
06:52 - gonna be a no edit coding challenge
06:54 - can't edit that out the camera went off
06:56 - it's fine it fixed it so I need to can I
06:59 - possibly make this bounding box without
07:02 - I mean I could just do this and here's
07:09 - the thing I want it to start right I
07:12 - want it to Y to start at height okay I'm
07:19 - getting some so now here we go
07:25 - processing is a flexible software
07:27 - sketchbook and a language for learning
07:30 - how to code okay this is great
07:33 - I'm we're wasting time here alright I'm
07:37 - told there is a specific color that I'm
07:41 - supposed to use so let's change that r75
07:45 - 2 1 3 2 3 8 all right cross the finger
07:55 - is a flexible software sketchbook I
07:57 - there must be a specific font it also
07:59 - needs to be full justified I'm gonna see
08:02 - if I can manage that but here's the
08:04 - thing it's so this is just scrolling up
08:05 - but I I have made this do not forget AP
08:11 - 3d sketch
08:12 - which means what I can do right now is I
08:15 - want to rotate the scene this way now if
08:18 - this is if this train whistle is
08:20 - representing my axis of rotation this is
08:23 - the z-axis that would be something
08:25 - spinning around if I were to just say
08:27 - for example whoops move them back out
08:30 - here and say something like oh let me
08:32 - rotate by you know 45 degrees which is
08:36 - radians of 45 or I'm gonna say PI pi
08:39 - divided by 8
08:41 - no pi divided by 2 is 90 so pi divided
08:44 - by 4 is 45 degrees we should see the
08:48 - text is completely gone why I need to
08:53 - blick I need to rotate around the center
08:55 - I need to rotate around the center of
08:58 - this look at that there it goes here it
09:00 - comes it's kind of like this
09:09 - that should be the sound effect that
09:11 - goes along with this all right so I what
09:13 - I want to do is rotate by X but let's I
09:15 - think actually what's going to make more
09:16 - sense is for the world of this universe
09:19 - that I'm building to be have its origin
09:22 - point in the center so really what I
09:24 - want is for I'm going to take out the
09:27 - rotate really what I want is to
09:28 - translate that the top left is the
09:31 - default origin point zero zero so now I
09:33 - want that origin point to be in the
09:35 - middle and you're going to see it now
09:37 - why am I not seeing anything I will
09:39 - eventually it's very slow the scrolling
09:42 - text way too overconfident about this
09:46 - but so now what I want is for the text
09:49 - actually to not be at zero comma Y but
09:53 - to be at negative width divided by two
09:55 - so offset it and then Y can start at
09:59 - height divided by two and now we should
10:02 - see back to what I had before and now
10:09 - hopefully I can now rotate right this
10:13 - was this will now rotate my text along
10:17 - the z axis so it's doing that but what I
10:20 - really want to do is I want to rotate it
10:22 - along the x axis I wanted to like sort
10:25 - of fold down so I don't say rotate X and
10:34 - processing is a flexible software is it
10:39 - too slow or it's not actually the
10:40 - appropriate speed I also can't see it at
10:43 - all so let's make it much wider Oh wrong
10:48 - color I'm told 238 to 1375 I did it
10:55 - backwards ok processing is a flexible
11:02 - software sketchbook and a language for
11:07 - learning how to code within the context
11:13 - of the visual arts I don't know it's
11:16 - going kind of slow let's uh let's have
11:17 - this go a little bit faster what else
11:20 - does this need this is done
11:22 - done four minutes ago yeah there we go
11:32 - what else should I do that is
11:36 - approximately the right speed yeah so
11:37 - the one thing is I pretty sure that if I
11:39 - were being true to this particular
11:41 - design it really should be full
11:44 - justified I'm trying to think of how to
11:46 - do that
11:47 - make it like 80% of the width yeah so I
11:51 - guess what I should do also the bounding
11:53 - box I guess I can adjust the bounding
12:00 - box ya know but that's not doing me any
12:05 - good because why doesn't that Oh No okay
12:14 - so negative width so hold on so I need
12:18 - to let me just make this so this should
12:22 - be negative W device so I want the
12:25 - bounding box and the text to be centered
12:27 - based on the bounding box so I've got a
12:29 - and I want that bounding box not have to
12:31 - be the full width so I'm shrinking it by
12:33 - like eighty percent and I probably
12:35 - should have the font the text size be
12:37 - related to the width as well so what it
12:39 - was like twelve hundred divided by 64
12:41 - mph it was sixty point that would be a
12:44 - hundred two hundred so I could say width
12:47 - divided by two hundred right oh no I
12:52 - meant to say not 220 so let's do this
12:57 - and so that's right
13:03 - I guess the size is too big actually so
13:05 - let's make the text size width divided
13:07 - with times 0.15 and now whoa
13:17 - I meant oh one five I don't know what
13:23 - I'm doing anymore
13:23 - just just make up numbers so no point
13:31 - force can be really thick
13:35 - Oh 5% oh yeah 5% 5% is good let's make a
13:40 - little smaller let's make it like 3%
13:43 - this is really the way this is the way
13:45 - to program just try different numbers
13:47 - oh the width is still too wide ah this
13:52 - is the problem I liked my size I wanted
13:58 - to enter there we go thank you
14:02 - that only took me a minute 42 seconds
14:05 - left processing is a flexible software
14:07 - sketchbook and a language for learning
14:09 - how to code within the context of the
14:11 - visual arts okay what else do I need to
14:13 - do in my minute and a half that I have
14:14 - left text mode is model or shape yeah
14:17 - yeah so there is a text mode thing oh
14:19 - the full justify no I have a challenge -
14:22 - you try - oh and the reason why I was
14:26 - doing this is because I wanted to
14:27 - demonstrate Processing's wonderful
14:29 - fullscreen function and whoa that's
14:43 - weird why did that happen when I went
14:46 - full screen huh do I just need to rotate
14:54 - much more what did I what did I do to
14:58 - deserve this
15:01 - that's so weird what if I do this how am
15:07 - i doing on time
15:19 - yeah that's so weird why would I went
15:22 - full scope from p.3d thank you I wonder
15:25 - I'm so of course size is where you
15:31 - specify the width and height manually
15:33 - and a particular renderer if I say full
15:36 - screen I still need to specify the
15:38 - renderer so it was working but it just
15:40 - defaulted to a 2d renderer and rotate X
15:42 - didn't work oh the timer went off
15:47 - I finished here we go we're done I can't
16:00 - do the gibreel sleng I can't talk while
16:02 - I'm eating how does he do it somebody's
16:05 - gotta have told me we don't know who I'm
16:08 - talking about
16:09 - check out de brillz YouTube channel I
16:10 - have now made a sideways scrolling
16:13 - yellow text thing with no theme music or
16:16 - branding whatsoever with some processing
16:20 - text in the amount of time that I was
16:23 - given it really should have it really
16:27 - should be full justified I will leave
16:29 - that to you I hope you make a version of
16:30 - this please make some but that timer do
16:33 - you hear the timer or you just hear it
16:37 - because I really want to hit okay okay
16:40 - make your own version of this add stuff
16:44 - to it to make it more fun or different
16:46 - or with your own style I'll try to make
16:49 - a JavaScript version of this with p5 and
16:50 - the WebGL renderer of p5 we could make a
16:52 - 3 J s1 and then of course all of you who
16:57 - know more than I do
16:58 - prop many of you could probably make a
17:00 - CSS one with transforms and all that
17:03 - fancy new stuff I know Sarah Dresner who
17:07 - is like my CSS probably knows a way to
17:11 - do this ok put a star field behind it
17:14 - yes you can do that good bye I'm gonna
17:15 - finish this I'm just like I'm just gonna
17:17 - be done with this Kody's down goodbye
17:22 - [Music]
