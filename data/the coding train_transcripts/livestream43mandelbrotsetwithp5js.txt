00:00 - oh hello welcome this session is not
00:08 - going out to Facebook I just noticed but
00:10 - such as life today just can't I'm not
00:13 - gonna not gonna fight with the system
00:15 - right now I know what I need to do
00:16 - though I need to refresh or login or
00:18 - lookout or something but hello anyway I
00:20 - think I'm streaming live that's always a
00:23 - good way to start I can see that I am
00:26 - there ok so welcome this is a bit of a
00:28 - not really a surprise but a kind of
00:30 - last-minute turning on the live stream
00:32 - it is Friday it is beautiful sunny and
00:35 - cool day in New York City it is a little
00:37 - after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time
00:39 - my name is Dan this is coding rainbow a
00:41 - place on the internet where me I guess I
00:46 - type at a computer and make some code
00:48 - examples and talk about them and answer
00:50 - questions in a chat more if you're
00:53 - interested in more so you can look at
00:56 - the description of this video there also
00:58 - be time codes in there are various
00:59 - points that happen in the video this
01:00 - various things that I do throughout this
01:02 - video will also be turned into shorter
01:04 - standalone possibly edited video
01:06 - tutorials and that's the usual stuff
01:10 - that I think I say at the beginning but
01:11 - I want to dispense with all the
01:13 - formalities because I'm usually very
01:16 - formal and I want to yeah I don't think
01:24 - there's forth this this is very this is
01:27 - this is kind of last night I didn't send
01:28 - out an email announcement about this but
01:30 - please if you're in the chat on YouTube
01:32 - please let me know if you can hear me
01:33 - okay and if the audio and sound and
01:35 - everything is alright alright so um
01:39 - let's talk about what I want to do in
01:42 - this particular session I have a few
01:44 - different topics that have been
01:46 - requested over the last couple months
01:48 - and I could do it could start with any
01:50 - one of them first let me cover what they
01:51 - are so I'm gonna open up a browser here
01:54 - I'm not at all prepared so I'm gonna
01:55 - have to do some organizing and getting
01:57 - ready and that sort of thing so
01:58 - something that's come up this is
01:59 - actually a really simple this could be a
02:02 - kind of simple quick one there is
02:06 - something called disk point picking we
02:10 - could you would need together here in
02:12 - this space right now
02:13 - right a computer program that randomly
02:16 - picks points inside of a circle and if
02:19 - we did it a certain way using something
02:21 - called polar coordinates and picked a
02:23 - random angle and a random radius we
02:26 - would strangely enough get a lot of
02:28 - points clustered around the center so
02:30 - there is a particularly rhythm sometimes
02:33 - that's great you like that that looks
02:34 - nice this is my beautiful perfect
02:36 - strange petri dish design but if you
02:38 - want to have a uniform distribution of
02:41 - points inside a circle there are some
02:44 - things you have to do to get this
02:45 - particular that is that on the right the
02:48 - version that's on the right so so that's
02:53 - one possible topic audio is okay
02:56 - everything is alright okay this is good
03:01 - it's nice to have a small intimate group
03:03 - today just here in the youtubes of the
03:05 - Internet's I only there's I'm here by
03:07 - the way at the school for poetic
03:09 - computation and there's a workshop going
03:10 - on and at five o'clock everyone from the
03:12 - workshop they're all collaborating most
03:14 - of them on outside or working on
03:15 - projects they're gonna present their
03:16 - work at five so I'm trying to do some
03:18 - stuff before five and then I'll be back
03:20 - on Monday for a kind of longer more
03:22 - official session where I will do more
03:24 - sound tutorials okay so this is one one
03:28 - possibility the other thing I would like
03:32 - to do which maybe is what I'll start
03:33 - with is the Mandelbrot set so this is
03:38 - yet another possibility just coding
03:43 - challenge sort of thing I'm starting
03:44 - from nothing quickly explaining the math
03:46 - behind the Mandelbrot set then writing
03:48 - the code to see it happen in the browser
03:49 - that's another possibility and then I
03:56 - feel like it your clothes have a crazy
03:58 - person talking to myself and then the
04:01 - other thing that I have in my head ah
04:03 - this is the super formula so super
04:10 - formula this thing which can get us
04:12 - shapes like this on the right which is
04:14 - part two of a series that I have where I
04:17 - eventually hope to get to doing some of
04:20 - these 3d forms but I'm not going to do
04:22 - the 3d part today I'm not mentally
04:24 - physically emotionally
04:26 - aired for that but I am prepared to look
04:29 - at this particular formula and apply it
04:30 - in code so that's those are the three
04:35 - topics I'm looking at the chat here
04:38 - informal anecdotal poll right now
04:41 - anybody have a feeling gut feeling if
04:43 - something you really want to see I don't
04:44 - know if I'll get to I forty-five minutes
04:46 - I don't know if I can do all three of
04:47 - those things in 45 minutes we got the
04:48 - Mandelbrot set we got the super formula
04:51 - and we got the disk point picking
04:53 - problem
04:54 - any requests I'm looking at the chat
04:59 - letting people arrive slowly oh those 15
05:01 - people here might not hold on enter full
05:04 - screen
05:07 - you know this incidentally I've noticed
05:09 - is not even though I didn't announce it
05:11 - and so it might be why there's probably
05:13 - a smaller number of people like a great
05:15 - time to do a live stream doesn't seem to
05:16 - be the case okay you know some of you
05:20 - requested dancing and there was no audio
05:22 - today so there was not gonna be a dance
05:24 - it but I could still do some dancing I
05:26 - can't really do it without music
05:28 - Matthew Friday is great I don't see any
05:30 - when voting in the chat I'm gonna do I
05:33 - feel the most confident I feel the least
05:37 - confident with the Mandelbrot set which
05:39 - is probably a good reason for me to do
05:41 - that one let's do the Mandelbrot set I
05:43 - actually already worked out some of the
05:46 - math for this earlier and I'm gonna
05:48 - erase it so that we could do it again
05:53 - okay I'm gonna clean this off here and
06:01 - then I gotta turn how is this lighting
06:02 - wise it's pretty dark over here right
06:03 - there's another light I can turn on it
06:05 - just that one seems to make this room
06:07 - especially hot okay racing this
06:12 - whiteboard here
06:20 - and next I am going to hello I'm going
06:26 - to turn off his light there's a little
06:30 - brighter over here hello this is where
06:31 - I'm gonna draw diagrams I'm coming back
06:34 - over here
06:34 - yeah Mandelbrot somebody voted
06:36 - Mandelbrot that's what I voted to me
06:38 - this might be the only thing I do today
06:40 - but I'm gonna so let me actually just
06:43 - look really quickly I forgot one thing I
06:46 - want to look at my existing Mandelbrot
06:51 - set example I forgot in this particular
06:55 - example how I chose the colors and I
06:57 - think I just used I just used the number
07:02 - of iterations the number of iterations
07:05 - okay and I'm in this like private area
07:12 - now the door is closed
07:13 - okay thanks Lauren okay here we go
07:16 - all right so great so I'm gonna do this
07:19 - in JavaScript let's find that I think
07:23 - the reaction diffusion example would be
07:25 - the best one to base this off of here it
07:29 - is so I'm gonna make a copy of that I'm
07:31 - gonna rename it to Mandelbrot I am going
07:36 - to open this in Adam which will be the
07:42 - text editor that I'm going to use and
07:46 - I'm gonna go to the code and oops Oh
07:50 - what happened to my fancy I had a maybe
07:56 - it's maybe it's right stuff okay
07:57 - I'm going to sorry sorry sorry I just
08:04 - want to clean this example up so that it
08:09 - can be a Mandelbrot set example and this
08:14 - is fine
08:19 - let's do this
08:31 - I'm just gonna put some random stuff in
08:35 - here and oh that worked it does work now
08:42 - uh and sorry everybody I'm I'm getting
08:46 - myself warmed up here
08:56 - I don't need any of this other stuff
08:57 - what am I missing here boy
09:00 - no need this there we go okay so then I
09:05 - just need to go let me let me leave
09:08 - processing aside and I'm just going to
09:13 - go to terminal
09:14 - and let's get this in the browser here
09:31 - and there we go and let me just do a
09:37 - couple more things to get ready here
09:44 - okay
09:45 - and line 11 oops how did that manage to
09:57 - work
10:04 - okay
10:08 - there we go all right so we're getting
10:10 - there
10:11 - whoops no no no and let's go to four
10:18 - let's do that I don't know what I'm
10:20 - doing I don't know what I'm doing
10:21 - anymore in my life I can't okay
10:27 - uh uh and we're gonna say well this
10:30 - actually just all work and setup because
10:32 - that would be just fine with me
10:37 - excellent okay everyone um let's see so
10:44 - who we got here now we've got let me
10:46 - just see here what do we got we got
10:47 - three wow this is pretty that's kind of
10:49 - amazing that 41 people with like
10:50 - watching this so I'm about to
10:52 - momentarily and I'm gonna just change I
10:55 - want to change my dimensions here I like
10:57 - to do six for 360 240 that'll work
11:03 - I am going to and I'm not gonna make
11:06 - this random anymore let's make these
11:08 - just all white I'm go all white is bad
11:16 - let's make it this color so I could see
11:19 - something with no background okay I my
11:22 - goal is to have the Mandelbrot set
11:23 - appear in this spot and I'm about to
11:29 - start working on it I'm gonna close this
11:32 - oh I really should left that open and
11:36 - we're going to go to I'm gonna I need I
11:39 - need a couple things one I like having
11:41 - this open and then let's just find like
11:44 - the Wikipedia page or something where
11:46 - the formula is visible that I can
11:48 - reference
11:55 - this is
11:59 - okay the Mandelbrot set is the set of
12:05 - complex numbers C for which the function
12:08 - f of Z equals Z squared plus C does not
12:10 - deferred what iterated from Z equals
12:13 - zero for which the sequence remains
12:15 - bounded and absolute value okay I am
12:19 - going to
12:21 - I think working at the energy here I did
12:23 - I could do some like jogging you can do
12:25 - some like what's like the Running Man
12:27 - it's like kind of like a dance right
12:32 - I should write with the Mandelbrot set
12:33 - I'm gonna working up the courage here
12:35 - I'm gonna cycle my cameras is 4:23 and
12:40 - what I'm going to do is do a coding
12:42 - challenge I have programmed this before
12:44 - but I did not try to do it today I did
12:47 - think about the math a little and
12:49 - program first so what I'm gonna do is
12:51 - I'm going to read this statement then
12:53 - I'm gonna say what a complex number is
12:55 - well I better practice that and B I'm
13:02 - going to go through the math and then
13:05 - I'm gonna take that math and put it in
13:07 - code I'm feeling okay hold on I just
13:16 - want to make sure warning for you
13:17 - YouTube video if you make one about this
13:19 - the random noise lowers the quality of
13:21 - the video a lot o I assume you already
13:22 - know this okay so that's probably why I
13:25 - have that flickering thing I am no
13:27 - longer gonna have that flickering thing
13:28 - but thank you for mentioning that I am
13:32 - recording this video to disk so
13:34 - hopefully that recorded to disk won't be
13:37 - a problem
13:41 - okay alright nobody seems to be
13:44 - complaining I think I'm ready to go I
13:45 - already cycled the cameras I've got a
13:47 - nice glass of water I've got my
13:49 - Wikipedia page here and so maybe I'm
13:58 - trying to sign maybe it would be better
13:59 - to start with this as my background I
14:02 - was like having the rainbow in the
14:03 - background though because I could make
14:05 - this I'm a little too can getting a
14:08 - little too concerned about this okay
14:10 - let's start with this as my background
14:12 - okay here we go I read everybody
14:23 - hmm so I was just thinking here I just
14:26 - want to look up just to get we I just
14:29 - want to look up you know I have my own
14:31 - sense in my head of what a complex
14:32 - number is
14:36 - that's what I was gonna say okay all
14:39 - right um all right I'm just gonna I'm
14:40 - just gonna get going with this anyone
14:42 - have any last okay okay here we go
14:48 - everybody
14:49 - whoops I do juggle I should just juggle
14:53 - instead for the span about set is making
14:54 - me very worried I have two erasers and
14:57 - some Kleenex so I'm gonna see if they
15:01 - can make a gift of this it's pretty good
15:05 - actually
15:06 - I would do tricks I could do tricks but
15:07 - I really need bean bags for those and
15:09 - and also clubs okay here we go everybody
15:14 - um oh now I'm gonna if something goes
15:17 - horribly wrong I've got the chat in the
15:20 - corner of my eye here over here and I am
15:24 - going to begin here we go there might be
15:28 - some strange noises and things happening
15:30 - in other rooms and places welcome to
15:36 - another coding challenge today's coding
15:38 - challenge is the Mandelbrot set
15:40 - Mandelbrot set is a very well known
15:42 - fractal named after its Discoverer is
15:47 - that a word Benoit Mandelbrot who knows
15:50 - if I pronounced that correctly the
15:51 - internet will correct me I'm sure you
15:53 - can use the Mandelbrot set to make
15:55 - patterns that look like the ones behind
15:57 - me and but on the one hand this is gonna
15:59 - be like a super simple thing to do
16:01 - because it's really just like I've got a
16:02 - screen and I've got pixels and I have to
16:04 - set each pixel a certain color and when
16:06 - I've done I see the Mandelbrot set on
16:08 - the other hand it's sort of like uh this
16:10 - is gonna feel complex numbers imaginary
16:14 - numbers well so let's so first before I
16:16 - get started I'm gonna write code in a
16:18 - minute but before I start writing the
16:20 - code I'm gonna go over here to this
16:21 - Wikipedia page and I'm gonna read this
16:23 - I'm gonna take a deep breath and I'm
16:26 - gonna not get to I'm not gonna get too
16:29 - worked up about it the man that brought
16:31 - set is the set of complex numbers so we
16:34 - first we need to understand what is a
16:35 - complex number okay for which the
16:38 - function FZ equals Z squared plus C does
16:41 - not diverge when iterated from Z equals
16:44 - zero what does it mean not diverge well
16:46 - later sort of says this remains bounded
16:48 - and half
16:49 - Lieut value okay so here's the thing I
16:51 - want to talk about what's an imaginary
16:54 - number what's a conflict what's a real
16:55 - versus imaginary number what's a complex
16:57 - number
16:58 - and then what does it mean to iterate a
17:00 - function over and over again and then
17:03 - just figure out what that function is
17:04 - bounded or not so let's come over here
17:07 - to my trusty friend the whiteboard
17:09 - I trust the whiteboard friend I have
17:13 - human friends I really do but whiteboard
17:16 - friends are okay too now okay so
17:19 - ultimately there's going to be a canvas
17:24 - hard-won and I'm not totally prepared
17:27 - that's why I'm making awkward awkward
17:29 - attempts at humor okay this is a canvas
17:31 - and ultimately what I'm going to do is
17:33 - look at every pixel on the canvas and
17:36 - perform an operation inside a color I
17:39 - was gonna look at something over there
17:41 - so now can I just start this whole video
17:47 - over I I guess it was probably fine
17:52 - but I feel like like a pronunciation was
17:56 - correct I'm gonna do this one again I
18:02 - apologize everybody but I I lost my
18:06 - train of thought I feel like you know I
18:08 - can see that YouTube graph I shouldn't
18:11 - you look at these analytics but on
18:12 - YouTube you can see analytics at the
18:14 - moment where people stop watching your
18:15 - video I was just like imagining by
18:18 - rambling at the beginning of way too
18:20 - long okay uh I'm glad I got the
18:24 - pronunciation right and okay okay okay
18:35 - okay
18:37 - I did not pronounce the T I said benoit
18:40 - mandelbrot but I pronounced the T and
18:42 - Mandelbrot invented most of the things
18:45 - collective I already studied unify yeah
18:47 - yeah yeah yeah
18:49 - yeah I'd say yeah the discoverer thing
18:54 - was to well I'm not even in the right
18:55 - camera okay the discoverer thing was too
18:57 - weird anyway okay the T is sound all
18:59 - right here we go we're gonna do this
18:59 - again you know what this is fine I'll
19:03 - open with this page I don't need this
19:05 - page oh I like this page why not okay I
19:08 - got to do this again I don't have a lot
19:10 - of time oh we have a half an hour and
19:12 - this is probably gonna take a half an
19:13 - hour so here we go I'm just like all the
19:19 - cameras again one more time in three two
19:29 - one
19:30 - hello welcome to another coding
19:33 - challenge in this coding challenge I'm
19:34 - going to with great trepidation but
19:36 - excitement and energy I'm going to
19:40 - program from scratch the Mandelbrot set
19:42 - show you how to do it talk about the
19:43 - math behind it and make it happen in
19:45 - javascript in the browser problems will
19:48 - come up but I'm gonna do my best so why
19:50 - why do you care about this it's a
19:51 - fractal pattern you can make some
19:52 - beautiful images with it you might also
19:54 - just sort of learn a bit about
19:55 - programming in pixels and arrays but
19:59 - yeah so I don't know you're here you
20:01 - probably want to do the Mandelbrot set
20:02 - if you don't you can go outside and play
20:04 - frisbee let's look at least and let's
20:06 - read this definition which you know it's
20:08 - gonna cause a small like a slight pain
20:11 - in my side here to read it but I'm gonna
20:13 - do it anyway
20:14 - and try to unpack and understand that as
20:15 - best we can in the context of a short
20:17 - YouTube coding challenge video okay the
20:20 - Mandelbrot set is the set of complex
20:22 - numbers see what does it mean
20:24 - for something to be a complex number and
20:26 - then to have a set
20:27 - that's the question we need to answer
20:29 - which the function f of Z equals Z
20:32 - squared plus C okay what does that
20:34 - function mean exactly does not diverge
20:36 - what does it mean for something to not
20:37 - diverge
20:38 - when iterated from Z equals zero okay so
20:42 - there's a lot of stuff in there and the
20:44 - first thing the first thing I want to do
20:46 - before I start writing the code is just
20:47 - talk about the math and the first thing
20:48 - I want to do is talk about what is a
20:49 - complex number okay so you might be
20:52 - familiar with an operation in math
20:54 - called square root I could say oh I
20:57 - think I have the wrong end of this pen I
20:58 - could say the square root of four by the
21:01 - way I forgot this whole thing I was
21:03 - practicing pronunciation and I
21:05 - completely forgot to do it the
21:06 - Mandelbrot set is named for the French
21:08 - mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot okay
21:12 - practicing st. Benoit okay the square
21:15 - root of 4 is 2 the square root of 16 is
21:21 - 4 the square root of negative 1 is what
21:28 - well in fact you might say to yourself
21:31 - there is no such thing as the square
21:33 - root of negative 1 it's impossible any
21:34 - number squared positive or negative
21:36 - results in a positive number so the
21:38 - square root of a negative number
21:39 - inherently does not exist this is not
21:43 - exactly the case in fact there is an
21:46 - answer to this and it's called I and I
21:49 - is an imaginary number it's imaginary
21:51 - because it's not a real number it
21:53 - doesn't actually exist but if we
21:55 - consider the square root of negative 1
21:57 - actually be something that does exist
21:58 - and call it I all sorts of magic can
22:01 - happen but of which by the way is the
22:02 - Mandelbrot set so this is what's known
22:05 - so this is a real number and this is an
22:08 - imaginary number if I put those two
22:10 - things together 3 plus I this is a
22:14 - complex number a complex number has both
22:17 - a real component and an imaginary
22:20 - component and it is typically written in
22:22 - the form a plus bi a is the
22:27 - quote-unquote real component B is the
22:31 - quote/unquote imaginary component I
22:36 - personally love imaginary numbers
22:39 - because I could just
22:39 - imagine that then use my creative
22:42 - imagination to think about imaginary
22:44 - numbers okay so so this is what a
22:48 - complex number is now let's go back to
22:50 - that definition the set of complex
22:54 - numbers okay what does it mean they're
22:56 - something to be a set of complex numbers
22:58 - well this actually relates to you can
23:00 - think about a canvas right a canvas or
23:06 - canvas the thing that lives in the
23:07 - browser in HTML or processing or Java or
23:10 - whatever graphics environment you're
23:11 - using has an x-axis and a y-axis it's a
23:17 - two-dimensional plane well what if a I
23:20 - don't know which one should be which
23:22 - I'll just pick one and hopefully the
23:24 - Mandelbrot set won't be upside down
23:25 - hey let's say a is the x-axis and B is
23:29 - the y axis the plane of complex numbers
23:33 - the set of complex numbers is all the
23:36 - number that appears here might have an a
23:38 - value of 7 and a B value of 3 meaning 7
23:43 - plus 3i so this plane this set of
23:46 - complex numbers is all the complex
23:48 - numbers for all of all a possibilities
23:51 - and all B possibilities so we have to do
23:53 - something for every single a set of
23:56 - complex numbers within this sort of
23:58 - bounds of this canvas ok so that's good
24:00 - which the function f of Z equals Z
24:04 - squared plus C does not diverge what
24:07 - iterating from Z equals 0 okay this is
24:09 - probably the hardest part for us to
24:11 - understand but once we understand it
24:13 - we're done and we can actually start to
24:15 - program the code so let me come back
24:18 - over here and let's write that so f of Z
24:24 - equals Z I wrote the wrong thing down I
24:28 - might need some more space let's see Z
24:31 - squared plus C now C is a complex is a
24:37 - complex number A plus bi
24:40 - any number from this spot and we want to
24:43 - iterate this function starting with Z
24:45 - equals 0 so if we start with Z equal to
24:48 - 0 what do we get
24:50 - well Z the next Z
24:53 - MZ like we're z1e if this is Z index you
24:58 - know Z sub zero Z of the zero generation
25:01 - Z of the first generation equals Z
25:06 - squared plus C which is by the way just
25:11 - C
25:12 - so now Z sub two equals what C squared
25:18 - plus C and Z sub 3 is going to be C
25:22 - squared plus Z squared plus C so one of
25:24 - the things we need to look at how to do
25:26 - here is how do we get C squared this is
25:29 - where I need a little bit more room C
25:35 - squared what is C squared C squared is a
25:39 - plus B I times a plus B I right because
25:44 - C is a complex number it has a real
25:48 - component and imaginary component a plus
25:49 - bi
25:50 - well let's multiply these two things
25:52 - together a times a is a squared plus a
25:58 - times bi plus a bi now bi times a plus a
26:06 - bi again be AI times bi now this is a
26:10 - crazy one bi times bi is what B squared
26:16 - I squared what's I I is the square root
26:20 - of negative 1 I mean it's imaginary but
26:22 - it is the square root of negative 1 so
26:24 - if you square it what do you get
26:26 - negative 1 so this actually turns out to
26:29 - be a squared plus this is a bi plus a bi
26:32 - plus 2 a VI plus oh no not plus minus
26:37 - because I squared is negative 1 minus B
26:39 - squared or we could look at this another
26:41 - way a squared minus B squared plus 2 a
26:46 - bi well guess what this is a complex
26:49 - number it has a real component a squared
26:52 - minus B squared and it has an imaginary
26:55 - component to a B so this is all the math
26:58 - that we need because what we're going to
27:00 - do is actually in our code just
27:03 - calculate these values over and
27:06 - we ran over again generation to
27:08 - generation we're gonna iterate iterate
27:09 - iterate and as we calculate those values
27:12 - over and over again we need to see do
27:14 - they remain bound in an absolute value
27:16 - so the question is are they tending to
27:20 - go towards infinity or they actually
27:22 - just like staying around some reasonable
27:25 - number and the Mandelbrot set is the set
27:28 - of numbers for which the function
27:30 - remains bounded so it's all the time for
27:33 - all of the possibilities it's all of the
27:36 - ones that don't tend towards infinity
27:38 - whoo that was a lot to think about maybe
27:41 - pause this video go outside do some take
27:43 - a break for a little while but now if
27:45 - you're back I'm gonna start you're
27:47 - writing the code for that I'm gonna
27:48 - refer back to this math a couple times
27:50 - probably I don't know if your father I'm
27:53 - having a good time
27:54 - okay so let's go to the code now I have
27:56 - a sort of empty p5.js sketch here and
27:59 - this is some JavaScript code it's just
28:01 - like a basic skeleton here the only
28:03 - thing that it's doing is it's looking at
28:04 - every single x value at every single Y
28:07 - value and setting its pixel to a
28:09 - grayscale value of 51 so I'm gonna go
28:13 - take a look at that it's right here you
28:15 - can see here there we go there's my gray
28:18 - window if I were to you know change this
28:21 - component to 255 you can see it's like a
28:24 - redder
28:24 - window because I added more red so what
28:27 - I need to do ultimately is ups is I need
28:31 - to inside this code for every one of
28:33 - these x and y values I need to run this
28:36 - Mandelbrot set F of Z Z squared plus C
28:39 - math thing and I need to see them are my
28:41 - numbers getting bigger or are they not
28:42 - getting bigger and then I'm gonna set a
28:44 - color based on that okay so now we have
28:47 - an interesting question though to ask
28:49 - which is hmm if this is my pixel window
28:53 - which goes from 0 to 360 and 0 to 240
28:57 - well do I really want and at complex
29:00 - number is a plus bi but do I really want
29:02 - to deal with complex numbers like 357
29:05 - plus 212 I know I really want my range I
29:09 - don't know what it should be but I'm
29:10 - gonna just go between negative 2 & 2 and
29:13 - then let's try that top to bottom and
29:16 - probably get something's gonna be
29:17 - squished but it'll be fine so
29:19 - what one thing the first thing I need to
29:20 - do is I need to figure out what are my a
29:24 - and B values relative to X and y so I
29:27 - want to map X which goes from 0 to with
29:30 - to maybe between negative 2 & 2
29:33 - let's make this a square and then I
29:35 - don't have to worry about any of this
29:36 - nonsense and then I'm gonna map B and
29:39 - this is really which goes from Y which
29:42 - goes from 0 to height also between
29:44 - negative 2 & 2 so I'm looking for all
29:47 - the complex numbers that go between
29:49 - negative 2 a plus plus negative 2 B no
29:56 - no sorry negative 2 minus 2i all the way
30:00 - to 2 plus 2i that's the full range okay
30:04 - so I want to use those numbers now I
30:06 - need to start doing that iterating okay
30:09 - so the first thing I need to do is say
30:16 - okay let's look at this
30:19 - we need to over and over again so we
30:21 - need to over and over we need an
30:23 - operation that's gonna happen over and
30:24 - over again so let's keep track of how
30:26 - one thing we should do is keep track of
30:28 - how often are we doing this let's have a
30:29 - variable called end because I want to
30:32 - just make sure like as long as n is less
30:34 - than I don't know some arbitrary amount
30:36 - 100 like I don't want to iterate more
30:38 - than 100 times I can keep doing what I'm
30:41 - doing and I want to have Z start with
30:44 - something so I'm gonna have Z start with
30:50 - 0 I'm sure I'm getting something wrong
30:52 - here because I'm it's like thinking
30:53 - about this as I'm doing and I'm gonna
30:54 - fix it as I go but let's let's figure
30:56 - out some things I need to calculate I
30:58 - kind of walk away pause recording to go
30:59 - look at my code from before okay but
31:01 - it's okay I'm fine I'm fine
31:03 - this is going to be okay okay did I get
31:07 - something wrong in the chat everybody
31:08 - put like rainbow emojis or something if
31:10 - I did something horribly wrong maybe
31:12 - rainbow maybe that's not right it should
31:13 - be rainbow if it's correct okay so the
31:17 - first thing I want to do is I want to
31:18 - calculate a squared minus B squared okay
31:22 - so I'm going to call that a a is our
31:27 - let's that's going to be my new a is a
31:31 - times a
31:33 - - B times B and then I also need to
31:37 - calculate - a B so I'm gonna call that B
31:42 - B is two times a times B so I have now
31:47 - calculated the real components the real
31:50 - and the complex components for the next
31:53 - generation and then what do I need to
31:57 - say to these say a equals a a and B
32:00 - equals B B and do it again so this is
32:04 - just my iterative process because I
32:06 - start with I think this is right
32:08 - write the number while yeah oh and then
32:12 - I need to say n plus plus okay now
32:19 - another thing I could do here is I could
32:22 - say like what does it mean for this
32:24 - tooten to be unbounded to tend towards
32:26 - infinity what if I just say something
32:29 - like I could be really lazy what if a a
32:32 - plus B B is greater than I don't know 16
32:34 - or I made up that number that means
32:38 - maybe and not and I want to take the
32:41 - absolute value of that what if the
32:44 - absolute value of those two the real and
32:46 - the imaginary component added together
32:49 - goes toward infinity Oh greater than 16
32:53 - that's my infinity then I want to break
32:55 - out of it so the question is did I get
32:59 - to 100 or did I not so look we're gonna
33:05 - come back maybe we'll talk about this
33:06 - again let's see let's see how far I've
33:08 - gotten why not use a for loop well I
33:10 - could use 1/4 don't make a lot of sense
33:13 - but I'm just using a a while loop for no
33:15 - good reason
33:16 - ok so now let's just do something I'm
33:19 - just gonna say like now if n let's
33:24 - equals if N equals 100 right if we got
33:29 - to the max iterations and I should
33:31 - probably make that a variable then let's
33:34 - make a brightness value brightness value
33:36 - equals 0 and then a brightness value
33:39 - equals 255 so let's just see what
33:43 - happens now
33:45 - if I basically with this simple little
33:49 - algorithm figure out whether n kept
33:53 - going and remained bounded or if it went
33:56 - to infinity let's see
33:59 - we should get we should get something
34:03 - well I got a nice like circle that's
34:06 - promising
34:07 - so now let's be a little bit more
34:09 - thoughtful about this maybe we can do
34:12 - some sort of coloring based on the value
34:14 - of n maybe that will get us something
34:17 - better
34:17 - so let's actually say now map n which
34:24 - could go from 0 to 100 between 0 and 255
34:32 - timeout this videos gonna get edited I
34:36 - think I did something run okay let me
34:41 - let me out this is for added point I'd
34:44 - like to sorry this was harder than I I'm
34:46 - gonna look at my processing sketch for a
34:49 - second because I just want to see what
34:51 - did I do wrong
34:56 - practice makes perfect huh max iteration
35:00 - so I did that 100 800 two times a times
35:06 - B yeah
35:11 - yeah oh I forgot the plus see the whole
35:18 - point of this is yeah I I'm an idiot
35:27 - this should be right ooh that's
35:35 - interesting
35:37 - wait what do i do differently here 16 is
35:41 - very big that's why we use down here
35:42 - though I remembered seeing that in my
35:44 - code a a minus B be a a minus B B he
35:50 - goes a a B equals to a B
36:06 - N equals zero and then color zero if
36:11 - it's equal to maximum
36:21 - that's interesting that it n mod 6 n
36:23 - times 16 mod 235
36:39 - what did I I must have dude unless
36:41 - something must be wrong
36:42 - okay let's what are the ranges in my
36:47 - processing sketch 5 yeah I did something
37:11 - mmm what did I miss here let me just do
37:19 - this for a second
37:39 - Oh something else is wrong cuz my math
37:41 - in here is absolutely right so I got the
37:44 - same result probably just have some like
37:51 - really stupid error somewhere you can't
37:56 - just because I'm not in draw right
38:04 - whoops
38:08 - I did it oh wait wait wait wait
38:20 - there is no I don't need the Z for
38:23 - anything I don't know why I have that Z
38:25 - there this must be wrong 0 2 with
38:31 - negative 2 I think the major for loops
38:40 - are messed up how are they messed up
38:43 - it's multiplying instead of a modulo
38:47 - what's the error sorry all done whoo
38:56 - yeah
39:02 - whoops sketch 40
39:09 - Oh clips
39:15 - what did I do wrong
39:20 - yeah you swapped the operators around in
39:24 - line 26 wait wait love I thought my line
39:30 - numbers are different now eh-eh
39:41 - this is right right I wonder if this is
39:45 - wrong am I just the idiot I didn't have
39:47 - this right
39:55 - no that seems right it's getting redder
39:57 - it's getting greener
40:05 - oh no absolute value why did I put the
40:08 - absolute value in there thank you mean
40:17 - no
40:22 - wait ayyyy quills a a plus a is not
40:25 - adding C to the value yeah well let's
40:34 - yeah that's thing that's got to be the
40:36 - place that I'm wrong right so let's look
40:38 - at this again sad state I got 10 minutes
40:45 - to fix this okay you get your chat going
40:48 - over C is C equals a plus bi okay let me
40:53 - to come back over here so what I start
40:59 - with is Z index 1 equals a plus bi
41:05 - because then Z index 1 equals that a
41:11 - plus bi a plus bi plus a plus bi
41:17 - right so that should be right though
41:20 - because this gives me a squared minus B
41:24 - squared plus 2 a B I plus a plus bi so
41:31 - then shouldn't I just add a 2 here and B
41:34 - 2 there and I've got the next a and B
41:47 - hold on Oliver's saying something
41:50 - Oliver always fixes this for me
41:57 - you reassign a and B those auditions oh
42:00 - yeah okay I thought I kept track of that
42:08 - though right ace like shouldn't a start
42:13 - oh because I'm iterating I need to keep
42:15 - track of the original no no each time it
42:19 - changes the first time I calculate a
42:23 - plus B squared maybe should be the
42:29 - initial a and B when it is added I don't
42:31 - think so you're right though that that's
42:33 - kind of what's happening in here x and y
42:41 - hold on
42:48 - I think you're right
42:57 - oh you're right cuz it's always of
42:59 - course you're right there we go thank
43:01 - you
43:02 - ah I knew I had it wrong okay that's it
43:05 - that's it of course that's it that's it
43:06 - that's it okay so let me let me come
43:10 - back Thank You Oliver
43:12 - I that's why I didn't have this problem
43:16 - because in my other example the reason
43:18 - why didn't have this problem is because
43:19 - I use X I use I and J and then I use X
43:22 - and then a and B become X but I keep
43:25 - that original X because they're
43:27 - iterating ah yeah okay okay
43:34 - ah alright so I got to come back somehow
43:38 - let's let me come back to I did
43:42 - something goofy there I had it like this
43:51 - right so this is what I had okay I had
43:59 - something like this okay okay thank you
44:08 - everybody
44:09 - here we come now we're coming back if I
44:12 - can finish this is just a few minutes
44:18 - welcome back so there's a critical flaw
44:20 - in the way that I wrote this code and
44:22 - that critical flaw is right here so let
44:25 - me go back and look at these formulas
44:27 - again which is that each iteration okay
44:31 - oh god this is something new that I
44:33 - wrote again one more time continuity
44:43 - error holds I'm just checking
44:47 - okay okay nope okay okay welcome back
44:52 - there was a critical error in what I had
44:54 - written here which I just I didn't
44:56 - notice and thankfully the Internet chat
44:57 - came to the rescue
44:58 - it is right here in these lines a equals
45:01 - a a plus a B equals B B plus B now let's
45:05 - go let's think about what's going on
45:06 - here if you recall the idea of what
45:09 - we're doing is we're
45:11 - z the new Z equals the previous Z
45:17 - squared plus C and all of the math that
45:21 - I did here all of this right here this
45:23 - is me figuring out what Z squared is Z
45:26 - squared is a a plus B bi
45:28 - that's what Z squared is so what do I
45:31 - need to do I need to then add to that C
45:34 - but C is always the core original real
45:40 - and imaginary component of where we are
45:41 - in this complex plane so even though I
45:44 - want the new a and B that's then gonna
45:46 - get squared for the next iteration the
45:48 - next iteration to get updated right I
45:50 - want the new a and B that's gonna get
45:52 - squared over and over to get updated
45:54 - this that's getting added to it see this
45:56 - is really what's standing in for C right
45:58 - here this has to be those original
46:01 - values so I'm gonna I'm gonna just do
46:04 - this I'm gonna say C a equals a and
46:06 - maybe somebody on the internet here can
46:09 - I'm gonna post this code to github can
46:11 - submit a pull request with nice variable
46:13 - leanings for all this stuff because I
46:14 - feel like boy this is like I I I have a
46:17 - pet peeve and I'm really doing my own
46:18 - pet peeve which is like all these
46:20 - cryptic variable names that would never
46:21 - make any sense
46:22 - if you were just coming to look at it
46:23 - but it is what it is right now so I need
46:25 - to store those original values and keep
46:28 - that as CA and CB so let's take a look
46:31 - now and see what we get
46:32 - ah this is starting to look like that
46:35 - Mandelbrot set you can see it there now
46:37 - you can see like oh I kind of like it's
46:40 - not exactly centered I've been sort of
46:41 - the wrong place so you know we can futz
46:44 - with that why don't we we could fund
46:45 - static say like oh let's uh let's kind
46:47 - of like have a little bit of a wider
46:49 - range
46:50 - oh and you can see I kind of like
46:51 - squished it so I'm gonna make Y the same
46:57 - there you go but it's also still doesn't
47:00 - really look exactly like what you think
47:02 - of when you think of the Mandelbrot set
47:03 - um you know if i zoom in you can see
47:05 - there's some level of greyscale there
47:07 - what I'm doing is I'm essentially saying
47:10 - let me just take the number of
47:12 - iterations that got you right if it got
47:14 - to 100 it's done the number of
47:18 - iterations before it breaks out and gets
47:22 - to before
47:24 - if it goes to infinity how many
47:26 - iterations did it take for it to go to
47:27 - infinity so first of all one thing I
47:29 - should say that if an equals 100 and
47:32 - this is driving me crazy I really just
47:34 - need a variable here which is I'm going
47:37 - to call max iterations and I'm going to
47:39 - set that equal to 100 because I hate
47:42 - that I'm typing this everywhere so I put
47:44 - this here and I put this here and I'm
47:46 - gonna put this here so now if n actually
47:49 - get to max iterations let's say the
47:51 - brightness is zero and now you can sort
47:55 - of see like ah look it's all black in
47:57 - the center and then there's some white
47:58 - kind of on the outside and there's so
48:00 - many different ways you could color
48:02 - stuff here's one way I'd use this sort
48:05 - of mapping way another thing that I
48:07 - could do is I can say n times 16 and I
48:13 - can say modulus 255 so I recycle back
48:18 - down to 0 and it co that looks kind of
48:20 - interesting I know I don't know what
48:21 - that what good that did and maybe I need
48:23 - to for that for it to look like what I
48:25 - wanted to look like but I thought this
48:29 - is how I colored it in a previous thing
48:30 - but you can see that you can kind of
48:32 - just do you can you can you can figure
48:36 - out all sorts of ways of coloring and
48:38 - this is actually where I will leave you
48:40 - you the internet in the chat in the
48:43 - comments suggest to me let me go to my
48:45 - processing version of this just to look
48:46 - at it I'm going to open open recent this
48:52 - is a processing example oh it's already
48:54 - here what did I do
48:56 - color equals n times 16 modulus 255 hey
49:02 - that's what I thought I just did n times
49:05 - 16 modulus 255 let's try that one more
49:08 - time
49:12 - who knows so modulus 256 that's a good
49:22 - point it's not gonna change it though
49:24 - the camera huh I reached the end of this
49:27 - horrifying video I but I don't know
49:34 - what's another way to color this
49:37 - let's just try n modulus 2 56 you can
49:43 - see there's something I'm looking in the
49:47 - chat and let's try and times 2 there we
49:57 - go n times 10 n times 5 you can sort of
50:05 - see what's going on here
50:06 - so I'm sure you guys can figure out a
50:08 - nicer way to color this using different
50:12 - RGB values based on cycling the number
50:14 - it's really that you know you can also
50:16 - play around with what's that maximum
50:17 - number of iterations what do you
50:19 - actually consider to be infinity like
50:20 - what happens if I make this to be 200
50:22 - you know that changes a little bit what
50:25 - if I make this one you know that changes
50:27 - it quite a bit you know you could also
50:30 - sort of play around with max iterations
50:31 - what if I make the max iterations 10 you
50:34 - can see what I got there versus a
50:36 - thousand you can see I'm starting to get
50:39 - more and more detail here the other
50:40 - thing I kind of want to do is give
50:43 - myself a little bit more detail so let
50:45 - me just go kind of zoom into it you can
50:49 - sort of so you can see so the idea here
50:51 - is that the Mandelbrot set right is a
50:54 - fractal in meaning that every part of
50:58 - the shape resembles the hole and if I
50:59 - start to sort of like zoom in we can
51:01 - look at the quality of this whole shape
51:03 - or we can kind of see like oh look that
51:04 - kind of looks like the whole shape and
51:05 - that kind of looks like the old shape
51:06 - and I could get finer and finer details
51:08 - I could do zooming stuff and also
51:09 - there's something interesting going on
51:10 - here they're these like nice little
51:12 - leaves that are popping up here and
51:13 - these are actually known these little
51:15 - parts of the Mandelbrot set are known as
51:17 - the Julia set and if I can manage to
51:21 - have the courage to publish this video
51:22 - online I will do another one that
51:25 - demonstrates the Julia set as well okay
51:27 - thanks for watching this
51:34 - let's see square root map and zero max
51:37 - ooh I like that okay wait hold on I
51:39 - think I should like I've been up do I
51:42 - think there should be like a crazy edit
51:43 - here I'm going to cancel that whole end
51:47 - of this video and I'm gonna take
51:50 - I'm gonna take let's look at a snake
51:52 - Fang suggestion here square root map n
51:58 - which goes from zero to max iterations 0
52:03 - to 255 divided by 16 why would I divide
52:09 - by 16 that's interesting
52:13 - that didn't work someone give me your
52:16 - color suggestion and I want to like
52:19 - somewhere in this I wanted to get cut
52:21 - the same thing but C equals zero and Z
52:24 - changes right yet yeah try adding
52:30 - absolute value I meant to have I had
52:33 - absolute value in there at one point I
52:34 - don't know why I took it out and when I
52:36 - was worried things were going wrong I
52:41 - should have stopped here there we go
52:44 - there's the this is what I meant to
52:46 - demonstrate which is really just that
52:49 - much
53:01 - there we go okay and let me let me
53:05 - actually make that a little something
53:08 - okay try map square root n zero to max
53:16 - iterations okay hold on I like this I
53:18 - like this
53:20 - okay so map square root of map okay hold
53:28 - on VAR something far be our equals
53:35 - map n which goes from 0 to max
53:38 - iterations to go between 0 and 1 that
53:42 - makes sense so this is like normalized
53:45 - norm so I'm going to normalize that and
53:48 - then map the square root of the
53:51 - normalized value which goes between 0
53:53 - and 1 to between 0 and 255 and
54:07 - there we go that's nice that's what it
54:09 - should there we go and then okay thank
54:14 - you
54:15 - Thank You Oliver the kindest soul I
54:18 - really appreciate it all right so there
54:20 - was a lot of me stressed out toward I
54:22 - don't know where I'm gonna cut this in
54:23 - Mattia I don't know what you're gonna do
54:26 - with this and it might just be what it
54:27 - was which is fine but I'm gonna try to
54:29 - reverse engineer back to where um I can
54:39 - remember this by the way what happens if
54:43 - I just yeah oh yeah I'm gonna okay so
54:54 - this is what I had and it was like not
55:00 - very good
55:08 - okay hold on I'm just gonna okay I got
55:12 - it I got it I'm gonna save our right
55:15 - equals 200 okay here we go
55:25 - uh okay so uh this is gonna get cut back
55:29 - in somehow I don't know how but it's
55:31 - gonna get cut back in somehow
55:42 - welcome back that was an awkward cut but
55:44 - so what I was having some trouble
55:47 - figuring out how to color the Mandelbrot
55:48 - set so I think it would be best to look
55:51 - at first actually it's just two
55:52 - completely simplify things so this is
55:53 - what the Mandelbrot set looks like if
55:55 - there's only two possible colors if
55:56 - there is a essentially a background
55:59 - color and a foreground color the
56:01 - background color is set to be 200 so
56:04 - every pixel is 200 unless it's something
56:07 - unless it's a pixel that's made it all
56:09 - the way to the max iterations that's
56:11 - with that's something that's bounded
56:12 - that's within the Mandelbrot set so if
56:14 - it's within the Mandelbrot set it's
56:16 - bright this is zero it's a black pixel
56:18 - otherwise its brightness is 200 so we
56:20 - can see it so what I want to do is keep
56:23 - that core Mandelbrot set the set itself
56:26 - with a pixel value of zero and now you
56:30 - could probably Google Mandelbrot set
56:32 - color system and you could probably find
56:34 - all sorts of ways of doing it but
56:36 - thankfully the Internet chat came to my
56:38 - rescue let's just look at one other way
56:40 - of coloring this particular fractal so
56:43 - what I'm going to do is what I want to
56:46 - do is say okay well the iterations got
56:48 - somewhere between 0 and 100 so I'm gonna
56:50 - map I'm just a little bit quieter now
56:52 - because I think there's a session coming
56:53 - next group I'm gonna map the number of
56:56 - iterations from 0 to max iterations and
56:59 - I'm gonna make that some brightness
57:02 - value between 0 and 255 let's look at
57:04 - that yeah kind of work but you can
57:08 - barely see what's going on there at the
57:11 - edges so we need a way of changing the
57:13 - kind of scale here and actually a better
57:15 - way of doing this would be to actually
57:18 - first just normalize and which goes
57:21 - somewhere between 0 and max iterations
57:23 - normalize that between a value of 0 and
57:25 - 1 and then I'm gonna say bright equals
57:29 - map the square root of that value which
57:33 - also but incidentally has a range
57:34 - between 0 and 1 to between 0 and 255 so
57:38 - if i do that and i refresh this page now
57:41 - you can see this is starting to look
57:43 - more like what you might be used to
57:45 - seeing in kind of Mandelbrot set
57:48 - visualization and the other thing you'll
57:50 - notice here is I'm just sort of looking
57:51 - at this zoom
57:53 - version of the Mandelbrot set the reason
57:55 - why it's zoomed out is because the
57:58 - minimum and maximum range here are
58:00 - between negative two point five and two
58:02 - point five so what if I went between
58:04 - negative one point five and one point
58:06 - five come on now you can see I'm kind of
58:12 - zoomed in on it and what if I went
58:14 - between negative 0.5 and 0.5 and by the
58:19 - way what if I just made these variables
58:21 - so what if I said min X equals a
58:25 - negative 0.5 min y equals and actually
58:30 - I'm just gonna say I'm gonna say min val
58:32 - is negative 0.5 and Max val is 0.5 and
58:37 - what I'm actually gonna do is let's make
58:39 - let's make a min slider oh I can't do
58:44 - that up here and a max slider min slider
58:52 - equals create slider now I need the
58:55 - minimum value to be some value between
58:57 - like I don't know negative two point
59:02 - five and zero and I'm going to start
59:06 - with negative two point five and have a
59:09 - range of increment value of 0.01 and the
59:14 - max value this is kind of silly what I'm
59:16 - doing how I'm doing this but max value
59:18 - is going to be the same but between zero
59:21 - and two point five and we'll start at
59:24 - two point five and then what I'm gonna
59:26 - do is actually say min value min slider
59:31 - value
59:35 - max slider dot value and I'm gonna do
59:38 - this now for a and B now I'm gonna map Y
59:41 - as well so now I have two sliders so if
59:45 - I run this program whoops
59:49 - create sliders not defined okay I forgot
59:51 - to include the p5 Dom library so let me
59:55 - include that p5 Dom library and you can
59:58 - see okay there's some sliders down here
60:00 - now now there's sort of an issue which
60:04 - is that I'm changing the sliders but I'm
60:08 - not seeing anything change so let's
60:10 - figure out what's going on here it is at
60:16 - negative 1.5 well I have no loop in my
60:18 - code because then draw it before I
60:22 - didn't want it to change so I just had
60:23 - no loop so I'm gonna take out no loop so
60:25 - that it loops but there really is
60:27 - another issue which is that you know
60:32 - it's I can I can make these changes but
60:34 - look how slow so this pixel operations
60:36 - are really really slow so I'm gonna do
60:38 - this just in I'm gonna make like a 100
60:41 - by 100 oh the other reason why it's so
60:47 - slow is I made this ridiculous 1,000 max
60:50 - iterations meaning for every pixel it's
60:52 - gonna iterate 1,000 times
60:53 - so that's terrible I don't need let's
60:55 - just do it like 50 times and now you can
61:00 - see like I can start to zoom in to
61:03 - different parts of the fractal it's
61:04 - actually quite fast so now we can see
61:07 - like well maybe I should let it be a
61:11 - little bit bigger and maybe I should let
61:16 - the maximum iterations be 100 and it's
61:20 - still kind of like at a reasonable speed
61:22 - and you can see I start to zoom in and
61:24 - we can really get the sense of the
61:26 - fractal this idea of a fractal of the
61:27 - entire shape of the Mandelbrot set there
61:29 - it is up there
61:30 - I can't reach up there because my hands
61:31 - get cut off but you see the idea if you
61:34 - could still hear guys speaking quietly
61:35 - this has kind of been kind of a crazy
61:37 - video but hopefully you've got something
61:39 - out of this talked a little bit about
61:40 - complex numbers imaginary numbers looked
61:42 - at how to set pixels according to what
61:44 - the properties of iterating those
61:46 - numbers have
61:46 - over a plane of XY values and looked at
61:49 - a little bit of how we can manipulate it
61:50 - with sliders and what I would love to
61:52 - see from you if you watch this video
61:54 - when it makes something with it look at
61:55 - the code think of a more thoughtful way
61:57 - of adjusting the range of doing a zoom a
62:00 - more thoughtful way of coloring them or
62:01 - thoughtful way of exploring hat with
62:04 - this algorithm you can do and in the
62:06 - next video someday I will not make this
62:07 - till next week I'm gonna look at what it
62:09 - means to create something called the
62:10 - Julia set which are little fractal
62:14 - patterns that are kind of like leaves or
62:15 - branches coming off of the Mandelbrot
62:17 - set we'll look at those in the next
62:19 - fractal Mandelbrot Julius that coding
62:22 - challenge video thanks for watching you
62:27 - guys are asking oh I didn't change width
62:29 - to height that probably didn't matter
62:31 - because yeah because the width and
62:35 - height are the same but yeah okay I am
62:49 - suggesting to make a work working copy
62:51 - of your code yeah yeah I you know today
62:55 - this wasn't this was a little bit of a
62:56 - mess today I'm speaking quietly because
62:59 - there's presentations going on in the
63:00 - next room and I didn't want to disturb
63:04 - them I may be a baby well maybe I'll
63:09 - come back next on Monday and do this
63:10 - Mandelbrot set thing again so
63:14 - unfortunately it's 5:15 now all I
63:17 - managed to do was the Mandelbrot set so
63:23 - I think I'm gonna go do you guys have
63:24 - questions anything anybody wants to ask
63:26 - before I go today I'm gonna be back on
63:28 - Monday for a more significant to our
63:30 - long experience one thing I was messing
63:33 - around with I don't know if it's
63:35 - actually already here I'll show you guys
63:37 - is hold on where's Terminal
63:46 - hold on control c-come on terminal what
63:53 - I'm going to do is look at the Monday I
64:01 - think oh yeah look at this sort of super
64:07 - shape thing so I this is part two of the
64:10 - super ellipse which is just adding a bit
64:12 - more and once I get through this I hope
64:14 - to be able to take that into 3d can you
64:20 - make a shape out of text can I make a
64:23 - shape out of text yes definitely I like
64:26 - that idea I should do some more of these
64:29 - kind of just like interesting strange
64:31 - graphics idea projects which I think
64:33 - might be nice other neural network I'm
64:41 - planning to do some machine learning
64:42 - topic videos at some point just not
64:44 - today just this one
64:48 - one topic for today people have been
64:50 - requesting ASCII art generator I like
64:54 - that idea
64:54 - cool ooh excellent
64:59 - Oliver is posting in the chat a link to
65:02 - Mandelbrot maybe I can bring it up
65:06 - whoops
65:07 - me I am so dot me slash old slash
65:11 - Mandelbrot vandal rot PHP
65:23 - cool so here you can see ah and the
65:27 - various and that's nice maksim
65:30 - iterations and generate this is great
65:33 - thanks for that reference okay everybody
65:38 - so I appreciate your patience with me
65:41 - today and your enthusiasm and
65:46 - unfortunately Mona have to shut this
65:48 - stream off today this was an hour and I
65:51 - will be coming back on Monday hopefully
65:53 - first thing in the morning on Monday
65:54 - this coming Monday the first thing in
65:56 - the morning is Eastern Time for me in
65:58 - New York City time and around you know I
66:00 - need as early as 9:30 more like 10:30 or
66:03 - 11:00 probably when I say morning by the
66:05 - time I get down here and get all the
66:06 - cameras set up and all that sort of
66:07 - stuff
66:07 - and I want to do more tutorials about p5
66:10 - GS and sound as well as maybe a couple
66:13 - other these coding challenge ideas okay
66:19 - so I have to go I don't know how I don't
66:22 - know how this is going to turn out but
66:24 - it is what it is and I'm gonna I'm gonna
66:26 - shut the stream off and please be in
66:28 - touch with me you can there's the ways
66:31 - that you can be in touch is Twitter is
66:33 - at Schiffman if your I have a new
66:35 - website I might as well show it right
66:36 - now
66:37 - coding rainbow comm so if you go to
66:40 - coding rainbow comm this just always has
66:43 - a link to the most recent video it's got
66:45 - a couple of links to some playlists down
66:46 - here some a place where you can sign up
66:48 - to get email announcements and I also
66:50 - recently launched a patreon which has a
66:53 - private slack channel that you can join
66:55 - for discussions and thanks for watching
66:59 - and have a wonderful weekend please be
67:02 - in touch send me your feedback write
67:05 - your letters of complaints to Brian
67:06 - Williams care of NBC and I'll be back
67:09 - again on Monday okay everybody I'm gonna
67:12 - sign off now
67:13 - thanks thanks again hopefully this
67:15 - Mandelbrot thing was somewhat helpful
67:16 - and there were some useful parts to it
