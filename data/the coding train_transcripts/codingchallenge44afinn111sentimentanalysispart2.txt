00:00 - part two of a fin 111 seventh analysis
00:03 - okay here we go
00:04 - so the first thing that I need to do is
00:07 - I want to load this file so so let's
00:14 - let's make a variable I'm gonna call it
00:16 - a fin again a fin equals low JSON eighth
00:20 - a fin 111 JSON and I just want to see
00:24 - that that worked I'm gonna say console
00:26 - that log a fin okay so we're starting up
00:29 - and I just want to see great so we can
00:31 - see that that list has been loaded which
00:32 - is wonderful now the next thing I need
00:34 - is I want to have a place so let's add
00:39 - some stuff here a fin sentiment demo
00:45 - let's say type here and make a text area
00:53 - of like this text area ID equals text
01:04 - text area okay so now I should have on
01:10 - the HTML page we should see whoops I
01:14 - definitely did something wrong text area
01:18 - text area there we go okay so we should
01:23 - see Oh a global function text because
01:27 - your code has already used it so I think
01:28 - that's bad idea too
01:30 - so let's call this txt okay so we can
01:34 - see here that now how do I by the way
01:36 - with text area I kind of just want it to
01:38 - already start as like a slightly bigger
01:39 - thing which is kind of unnecessary I'm
01:41 - gonna say columns equals 50 so that's
01:44 - good and rows equals 10
01:49 - okay so now I can the idea here is that
01:52 - what I want to do is as I type here
01:55 - I am happy how are you what I want to do
02:01 - is I want to live calculate the
02:04 - sentiment of this text and have it
02:06 - appear below even as I press every
02:07 - single key so first I need to bind some
02:11 - sort of event so I needed an event for
02:13 - every time I type into this text area so
02:15 - first of all I need access to this text
02:17 - area in JavaScript and I can do that
02:19 - with the Select function if I were
02:20 - jQuery I'd use that dollar sign thing or
02:22 - document dot get element by ID and with
02:25 - a regular JavaScript so I called ID was
02:28 - txt so what I need to do is say VAR t x2
02:33 - equals select by the ID txt and then the
02:37 - event that I want to track is called an
02:40 - input event there's a changed event
02:42 - there's a change event and an input
02:44 - event it's a little weird and in job in
02:46 - the browser the changed event is only if
02:47 - I hit like enter or tab so I like
02:50 - finished my action but the input event
02:52 - happens any time I press a key at all so
02:54 - text input I'm gonna call this event
02:57 - typing and I'm gonna say now function
03:00 - typing and I'm just gonna say console
03:03 - dot log txt value so what I want to see
03:07 - is as I'm typing I just want to see that
03:10 - I have access to the words that are in
03:12 - what I'm typing okay so let's refresh
03:15 - this and say hello how are you and you
03:19 - can see that this is working that as I
03:22 - type what I'm typing every time I hit a
03:24 - key it comes out in the console there
03:28 - okay so that's perfect that's what I
03:30 - want now I can start to calculate the
03:32 - sentiment score so what should I how
03:36 - should I calculate the sentiment score
03:37 - the first thing I need to do is split up
03:40 - the text by words and I can use a
03:42 - regular expression see my videos about
03:44 - regular expressions using the split
03:46 - function so I'm gonna say var I'm gonna
03:48 - say tokens I'm gonna say words words
03:50 - equals txt dot split and then I want to
03:53 - split by a regular expression and a
03:55 - regular expression in JavaScript is a
03:57 - string like a sequence of characters
03:59 - that goes between forward slashes rather
04:02 - than between quotes and it defines a
04:04 - pattern in the text I have a whole set
04:05 - of videos all about regular expressions
04:07 - what the pattern is what separates the
04:10 - words so whitespace commas periods
04:13 - punctuation whitespace that sort of
04:15 - things basically I'm gonna do something
04:17 - kind of silly and simple here I'm gonna
04:18 - say anything that's not a letter or
04:22 - number
04:23 - and so there's I can actually just say
04:27 - /w so this is /w is any letter or number
04:32 - and backslash capital W is any non
04:34 - letter non number and I could also say
04:37 - maybe I should say or an apostrophe
04:39 - oh no but that's included no one I
04:40 - should have let it be or not anyway
04:42 - whatever this will be good enough for
04:44 - now you can refer there's you can spend
04:46 - your life dupatta to trying to define
04:48 - the best regular expression for
04:49 - splitting tokenizing a sentence into
04:52 - words or words a paragraph in descent
04:54 - into sentences or essay into paragraphs
04:56 - all that sort of thing okay so I'm gonna
04:59 - do that and then I'm just gonna see that
05:01 - this works I'm gonna say console dot log
05:03 - words just to check that hello Oh
05:07 - txt dot split is not a function well of
05:09 - course it's not a function because txt
05:14 - oh I can't come up with variable names
05:20 - were text input fine equals T X T dot
05:24 - value so I want to get the value that's
05:28 - the contents and then I need to split
05:30 - that so that's good that I checked that
05:32 - and now I'm gonna say hello this is a
05:36 - test so you can see as I type it's
05:39 - splitting up into an array of words
05:41 - perfect so now I need to iterate over
05:43 - that array of words so I need to say for
05:46 - VAR I equals 0 is less than words dot
05:50 - length I plus plus now here's to
05:53 - something that's important let's go back
05:55 - to our a fin 111 list notice something
05:58 - here all of these words are entirely
06:01 - lowercase there is not a single
06:04 - uppercase letter in this particular word
06:07 - list so one thing I definitely want to
06:09 - do is when I'm in my code the first
06:13 - thing I want to do is say word equals
06:15 - words index i dot to lowercase because
06:19 - when I look up to see what its score is
06:21 - I need a lowercase word so now now that
06:25 - I've done that then I want to say does
06:31 - does that word exist so if a fin word
06:39 - but does it exist now I could use this
06:41 - has I should probably use the has owned
06:43 - property thing so this is me asking like
06:46 - this will if let's say the word is cat
06:48 - if cat is in the F in word list I'm
06:51 - gonna get the score for cat like three
06:53 - maybe kitten would be like four I don't
06:56 - know Catherine kittens they're equal I
06:58 - love anyone I'm so worried about
07:00 - offending words and their positive
07:03 - negative score very strange personality
07:06 - I have okay but there was a point to
07:08 - what I was saying which is that that
07:14 - right if cat exists I'll get the score
07:17 - like for if it doesn't I'll get
07:18 - undefined which will evaluate to false
07:20 - but there's a weird sort of issue here
07:22 - like sometimes like there might be like
07:24 - some built in JavaScript properties that
07:26 - happen to have the same word as a word
07:27 - and they'll in the essay so to be a
07:30 - hundred percent sure I can say has own
07:33 - property this will evaluate to true or
07:36 - false if word is a particular property
07:40 - of this list that I've developed that's
07:42 - not part of the sort of JavaScript
07:43 - object thingy language itself whatever
07:46 - okay so if it does first of all I need
07:49 - to say score equals zero I can say score
07:53 - plus equals effing word so now I can
07:57 - look up the score and add it and then
07:58 - what I'm gonna do is let's let's add a
08:02 - little area for results I'm gonna say
08:06 - PID equals
08:09 - score and let's I'm gonna add some
08:13 - things p score comparative and what else
08:20 - maybe I'll do a word list just so we can
08:23 - see everything on the page so okay so I
08:26 - added three paragraphs because I want to
08:28 - like report some information on the page
08:30 - so the first thing I can do now in
08:32 - JavaScript here is say I can save our
08:38 - score P equals select score and then say
08:43 - scorpio HTML is the score
08:50 - this is sort of I have there's better
08:52 - ways I could do this but this will work
08:53 - just fine Comparative select comparative
08:59 - and then the comparative is the score /
09:06 - words length so the score divided by the
09:09 - number of words in the file and then
09:12 - also maybe word list select word list
09:19 - and word list HTML oh I'm not saving the
09:23 - words so let's make a list so let's
09:29 - let's make a list we'll call it scored
09:32 - words and it's an empty array and if I
09:35 - ever find one of those I'm gonna say
09:37 - scored words don't push the word oh and
09:42 - maybe : its score something like that so
09:49 - you know this I'm not being very
09:50 - thoughtful about the design of the
09:52 - display of the results but comparative
09:56 - okay but let's see if this works
09:59 - hello oh uncaught reference error score
10:02 - words is not defined scored words scored
10:07 - words and Oh scored words I don't know
10:12 - what I'm doing here okay let's try this
10:15 - so okay let's try typing I love kittens
10:19 - and rainbows also unicorns and the color
10:25 - purple and pink and red green and blue I
10:30 - am happy so so very very happy and
10:34 - joyful so you can see Oh some couple
10:39 - things are wrong here this is not at all
10:42 - correct so what's happening here it's
10:45 - getting the information from the it's
10:50 - getting the information from the JSON
10:52 - file and it's adding those numbers
10:54 - together it's saying 3 plus 3 plus 3
10:56 - plus 3 equals 3 3 3 3 3 so it's not
11:00 - adding them as numbers it thinks
11:02 - everything is a string
11:02 - which is also I'm getting some goofy
11:04 - results here so one thing that I need to
11:07 - do here is make sure that when I get
11:11 - that score I convert it to a number so
11:15 - let's fix that right that that score
11:17 - that's coming out of the word listen I
11:18 - need to convert it to a number I should
11:21 - have just happy sad not so sad but not
11:27 - so happy okay happy and joyful and full
11:31 - of scared fear for things that scream
11:38 - and monsters but I like I still
11:42 - recording because it dies by my weird
11:46 - nonsensical typing so you can see I'm
11:48 - now getting now I'm seeing some weird
11:51 - stuff going on here which might just be
11:54 - the fact that I'm not being very
11:55 - thoughtful about how I display the
11:57 - information but let's do some more tests
12:00 - here if I say sad okay that works
12:03 - exactly what I would expect let me move
12:05 - this over here right I got a total score
12:08 - of negative two comparative is negative
12:09 - two because it's negative two divided by
12:11 - one word total if I say happy right okay
12:14 - so this is working and abandoned I
12:17 - remember was in there is negative one so
12:20 - it's just the formatting so what so
12:21 - we're really done I could copy and paste
12:23 - some text like I don't know if I go to
12:26 - kittens Wikipedia let's get some text
12:33 - about kittens and see what happens if I
12:39 - paste it in here we can see I got a
12:43 - score of four comparative of 0.04 this
12:46 - is positive text the words that I got
12:50 - were solid and enjoy I should get a
12:53 - score of six
12:59 - so something is wrong here right what
13:02 - did I forget I made it there's a bug in
13:03 - my code oh I put the score once again
13:09 - I'm conflating the total score and the
13:13 - individual word score so I should really
13:15 - if I want to be thoughtful about this
13:16 - boy I'm terrible this was stuff I should
13:20 - really say var score equals I don't
13:23 - think it was that at all I think it was
13:26 - this was my problem all along so I want
13:30 - to make sure I have a difference between
13:33 - the individual words score and the
13:37 - actual total score that I'm adding up
13:40 - and so this is the total score and this
13:43 - is the total score and the in the things
13:46 - that I'm putting into the list just add
13:55 - some padding here for formatting now
13:58 - happy-sad this is better yes no no no no
14:06 - no no no no no no no okay so there we go
14:13 - you can see now I have real-time
14:15 - sentiment analysis where I could be much
14:18 - you know if you're watching this video
14:19 - if you're gonna make something with this
14:21 - you could be so much more thoughtful in
14:23 - terms of how you display the results
14:25 - whether it's color of visualization
14:27 - formatting the numbers nicely formatting
14:29 - the list of words in a different way but
14:31 - you have the basic framework for it here
14:34 - I will show you that there is a major
14:35 - issue with this particular approach okay
14:40 - so here's a particular issue here is my
14:43 - text that I am going to type right now I
14:47 - am NOT sad I am not at all unhappy I am
14:54 - not feeling worse today so you can see
14:58 - I've got a really really negative score
15:01 - of negative six even though I said I'm
15:03 - not sad I am not at all unhappy
15:05 - I'm not feeling worse today because this
15:07 - particular technique is only looking at
15:10 - the raw counts
15:12 - words and those scores if I want it to
15:15 - be a little more thoughtful about this I
15:17 - could try to add a little bit of natural
15:19 - language processing for example the
15:21 - JavaScript library NLP compromise that I
15:23 - demonstrated can look for um if a
15:26 - statement is a negation and you could
15:28 - perhaps invert the score and then of
15:30 - course I could use a more sophisticated
15:31 - not training methodology I'm actually
15:34 - not using a word list but having a
15:36 - machine learning system learn about
15:38 - positive text learn about negative text
15:40 - based on just word frequencies and words
15:43 - being next to each other and that sort
15:44 - of thing in a much more open-ended way
15:45 - but this hopefully should get you
15:47 - started on something if you're
15:49 - interested in its text analysis and how
15:51 - you might apply this to what type of
15:53 - data source and how you might show the
15:55 - result or how you might create an
15:56 - interface for people to type into and
15:58 - give us some information back ok um so
16:02 - in the chat Gaurav writes you must be
16:06 - sad that's why you were insisting on it
16:08 - very much and you know what I think
16:09 - maybe this is a smarter sentiment
16:11 - analysis technique tonight than I knew
16:14 - because maybe it can read in between the
16:15 - lines ok thanks very much for watching
16:17 - this sentiment analysis video and I'll
16:20 - see you in other videos in the future
16:22 - perhaps
