00:02 - there was a time when I made a video and
00:05 - at the beginning of the video I said
00:06 - this video will be about to select and
00:09 - select all function in p5 and then the
00:11 - entire video was about something else
00:13 - now I'm saying the same thing but this
00:15 - video really is about that and the
00:16 - reason the other video is about
00:17 - something else entirely is what I
00:20 - covered was this idea of selecting by
00:23 - tag versus ID versus class and what I
00:26 - used that for assigning those things CSS
00:30 - in my writing style tag or creating CSS
00:34 - file directly in your HTML file so now
00:36 - what I want to look at is how do you
00:38 - select from your code by tag by ID or by
00:42 - class then you have access to elements
00:44 - and you can assign them events or
00:46 - behaviors or change their style
00:47 - dynamically all sorts of things like
00:49 - that
00:49 - so let's take a look over here at this
00:53 - particular page did I want to come over
00:55 - here yet no I didn't come over there in
00:58 - a second so let's so ok so this you know
01:03 - did it did it did it go back in time and
01:05 - erase that but whatever this here is for
01:09 - pretend HTML some HTML I can edit this
01:14 - video it's gonna be fine I'm just gonna
01:15 - keep going
01:16 - so what I want to do is look at how that
01:18 - works and I'm gonna I'm gonna write this
01:20 - out here I think so here was the way of
01:22 - creating a selector like the ID unicorn
01:24 - got this particular style and if you're
01:28 - doing this instead from within
01:30 - JavaScript the equivalent of that would
01:32 - be I erased like I think the wrong thing
01:36 - but VAR element equals select unicorn so
01:48 - in other words I did this wrong in other
01:51 - words this is what I had before select
01:55 - by unicorn this is this is CSS CSS is
02:00 - select the ID unicorn and assign all
02:03 - sorts of style information here now in
02:06 - JavaScript I'm saying select the item in
02:09 - the Dom element on the page by the ID
02:12 - unicorn
02:13 - that's not what I wrote I forgot that
02:15 - you need this pound symbol to indicate
02:17 - ID so up here this should say pound
02:24 - unicorn can you see that you can't kind
02:27 - of trails off there this is calling
02:28 - there so this is a way of encode
02:31 - selecting a particular Dom element and
02:34 - now this element you could call all the
02:37 - functions you might normally call with
02:39 - the Dom element like change it to HTML
02:42 - content change its style a sound a sign
02:45 - of mousepressed event so the reason for
02:49 - me showing this to you which I really
02:52 - probably should have said the beginning
02:53 - is we have this kind of like big
02:55 - question which is let's go to cut the
02:57 - code here and let me say create P this
03:01 - is a paragraph made by me and I'm going
03:07 - to run this code and you can see look at
03:08 - this this page has all of this content a
03:13 - unicorn and rainbows rainbows more
03:15 - rainbows just a plain paragraph the
03:17 - click Me button a canvas and this is a
03:20 - paragraph made by me so what I am
03:22 - suggesting to you is all of this stuff
03:26 - up to click me this is all content that
03:29 - I wrote into the HTML file and and now
03:35 - down here these two elements are things
03:38 - that were made in JavaScript so look
03:41 - create canvas makes the canvas create P
03:44 - makes the paragraph and then here in the
03:46 - HTML file here is all the stuff that I
03:49 - wrote into the HTML file so why why oh
03:53 - why oh why this is the like this is the
03:56 - crux of today this is a existential
03:59 - question that that that we all have to
04:01 - ask ourselves why would you make a Dom
04:04 - element in the HTML file why would you
04:07 - make one in JavaScript let's think about
04:10 - this for a moment before my answer to
04:13 - you of why you would make one in
04:15 - JavaScript is the reason you would make
04:17 - one in JavaScript is you need to have
04:19 - access to it in JavaScript so making a
04:20 - JavaScript and then you know you have
04:22 - access to it
04:22 - javascript today we will that's not a
04:25 - good enough reason because the Select
04:26 - function to select all function will
04:28 - give you access in JavaScript just
04:30 - something that was in the HTML file so
04:31 - now you really have both options and I
04:33 - would say it really depends on how you
04:36 - feel what your what your goals in life
04:39 - are you know what kind of person you are
04:41 - what's your favorite color is you know
04:42 - that kind of stuff I mean you can kind
04:43 - of do either and maybe you like making
04:45 - in the JavaScript maybe like making HTML
04:46 - but I think there are some scenarios
04:48 - where it makes more sense to do one or
04:50 - the other for example if there is a lot
04:52 - of kind of existing content that you
04:54 - just want to be on the page when it
04:56 - first loads and you want to be able to
04:58 - really custom you know work on how that
05:01 - content is organized and how it flows
05:03 - it's a lot of content it kind of might
05:05 - be silly to have a zillion create peas
05:08 - just to like and just to like create
05:10 - that content initially so the initial
05:12 - content of the page and the sort of
05:14 - overall structure of the page I think
05:16 - that might make sense to do in HTML if
05:20 - you wanted to have this paragraph if you
05:24 - wanted to say this is a random number I
05:26 - wonder if I said this already in another
05:29 - video and then said random 100 right
05:33 - this is something that you would want to
05:36 - do perhaps in as a dynamic element right
05:40 - if your content is it pick say a new
05:44 - affirmation every day that it shows on
05:46 - the page perhaps you might want to
05:48 - create that element dynamically of
05:49 - course you could assign its content
05:51 - dynamically and created in the HTML but
05:53 - you know the point is you know if there
05:55 - is something that involves a set of
05:57 - rules or some sort of input some sort of
06:00 - external data from some source that
06:02 - might be something that you need to sort
06:04 - of generate in JavaScript if you wanted
06:06 - on this page there to be a thousand
06:08 - paragraph elements all with random
06:09 - numbers you wouldn't want to in HTML
06:12 - type ppppp a thousand times you don't
06:15 - want to use a for loop to generate a
06:17 - thousand elements so I kind of off on
06:19 - this little digression here it's a
06:20 - relevant digression but this is really a
06:23 - question I would love to hear your
06:24 - thoughts on the matter like when do you
06:26 - write your content in HTML when do you
06:29 - create the Dom elements in JavaScript
06:30 - why would you do one for the ester as I
06:32 - make more and more videos in particular
06:33 - once I get to
06:35 - data and epi is videos are gonna see a
06:36 - lot of different scenarios but for now
06:38 - let's not worry about answering that
06:40 - question let's just look at how it works
06:42 - so let's say you don't make anything you
06:50 - don't make any Dom elements in
06:52 - JavaScript you've made all of them here
06:54 - in HTML how do you apply something to
06:58 - for example the unicorn paragraph well
07:02 - with the Select function so now I could
07:05 - say something like unicorn our you know
07:07 - paragraph equals select unicorn close
07:12 - this there's a picture of B on this
07:14 - laptop and it's very distracting and I
07:16 - could say paragraph dot style you know
07:20 - background color you know f0f so now if
07:27 - I were to run this you can see here this
07:29 - is how I was able to address this
07:33 - particular Dom element in JavaScript so
07:35 - I was able to organize all of the
07:38 - initial content in the HTML file but
07:40 - call a function on it dynamically in
07:43 - JavaScript and you know I could do
07:45 - something like paragraph dot mouse over
07:50 - you know change background and then I
07:56 - could put this in and this might be a
07:58 - more common scenario here where I'm now
08:03 - going to when I mouse over that element
08:07 - right I'm assigning an event callback to
08:10 - that particular paragraph that I
08:11 - selected with the Select function and
08:13 - now I'm going to execute this function
08:15 - so now as I move the mouse over here oh
08:17 - that was so close anybody see what I
08:20 - missed here oh you know what I missed
08:23 - look at that made a sort of classic
08:24 - error and actually there's an error down
08:26 - here it's good to have these mistakes
08:27 - uncaught reference error paragraph is
08:30 - not defined
08:30 - why is paragraph not defined because
08:33 - paragraph was declared as a variable in
08:36 - setup its scope is local only to setup
08:39 - which is not available to us in this
08:40 - change background function now there are
08:43 - so many kind of JavaScript ways to get
08:45 - around this issue and it's gonna
08:46 - actually come up
08:48 - wonderful way in the next video when we
08:49 - look at how to assign the same callback
08:52 - to like a hundred different Dom elements
08:54 - boy that's gonna be a great moment but
08:56 - for right now just in our sort of
08:57 - simplicity here I'm gonna just make this
09:00 - a global variable and say paragraph dot
09:05 - select so now the paragraph variable is
09:09 - a global variable to clear it up top so
09:11 - it's available in setup and in the
09:13 - change background function and there we
09:15 - go and now over here I mouse over it and
09:18 - it turns purple so you can see howdy
09:20 - this is how you access an element now
09:22 - another place that might make sense for
09:24 - me to do this is to select that button
09:30 - so if I want to select the button the
09:33 - button has an ID I gave the idea that
09:35 - hey my button and so pound button button
09:41 - Mouse pressed and then you know canvas
09:47 - background I'll write a function called
09:51 - canvas background and then I'll say
09:54 - background you know random 255 so now
09:58 - this is also a nice way if you want to
10:00 - set up the layout of your page have the
10:03 - button in exactly the right place but
10:05 - not have to figure out how to do all
10:06 - that with Create button so instead of
10:07 - saying create button the button already
10:09 - exist in HTML I'm selecting it and
10:12 - assigning an event to it so now here we
10:14 - go every time I click that button you
10:16 - can see the background color changes
10:18 - randomly so this is a nice way of
10:20 - working just by giving your Dom elements
10:23 - IDs selecting them in setup and then
10:26 - doing whatever you want to them
10:28 - anywhere else in your code now I'm at
10:32 - ten minutes and I'd like these videos to
10:34 - be about ten minutes this one's gonna be
10:36 - about 15 because I have another piece of
10:38 - this that I think is really important to
10:39 - look at
10:40 - we've spent a whole lot of time talking
10:43 - about the different kinds of selectors
10:45 - this is an ID and ID is for a single
10:48 - item but I could select by paragraph
10:51 - which would select all of the paragraphs
10:53 - or I could select by a class which would
10:56 - be select a group of paragraphs that
10:58 - have a group sorry not just pair
11:00 - a group of elements that are members of
11:02 - the same class so what what happens if
11:06 - we do that now let's let's look at this
11:07 - and I'm gonna do something here I'm
11:10 - gonna move this unicorn one just down
11:12 - here just to change the order and I'm
11:14 - gonna change this comment this out and
11:20 - I'm gonna say select by rainbow so this
11:24 - is selecting a paragraph of the class
11:29 - rainbow what is there which hold on a
11:32 - second how many paragraphs and actually
11:34 - let's go back and even further step
11:35 - select P this is just selecting a
11:38 - paragraph but which paragraph there are
11:41 - a lot of paragraphs mmm a 1 2 3 4 which
11:47 - paragraph is our going to select or
11:49 - shouldn't it select all of them let's
11:51 - see what happens okay hover over this
11:54 - one no hover over this one no hover over
11:56 - this one over this one yes so notice
11:58 - that when you call select with either a
12:00 - tag or a class it will just give you the
12:03 - first element it finds on the page
12:06 - that's a member of that tag or class but
12:10 - most likely that's not really what you
12:12 - wanted - most likely the reason why
12:14 - you're selecting by tag or class is
12:16 - because you want all of them and so in
12:19 - order to do that the function select all
12:23 - comes up so let's look at this for a
12:25 - second
12:26 - this is selecting by ID and you get a
12:31 - single element what I'm suggesting to
12:35 - you is if if I'd say select all by a
12:41 - particular tag so select all the
12:44 - elements that have been our paragraph
12:46 - elements what is this I cannot say
12:49 - elements dot something because while
12:51 - this is a single Dom element this is an
12:54 - array so select all will give you an
12:56 - array of paragraph paragraph paragraph
13:00 - paragraph so if you want to do something
13:03 - to all the elements you have to
13:05 - individually address the elements of the
13:07 - array and one way to do that is with a
13:09 - loop so coming back over here if I were
13:12 - to change this open
13:13 - not over here coming back over here if I
13:16 - were to change this to I'm just gonna
13:19 - call it paragraphs I don't have to use
13:21 - an S but I think it's sort of and I were
13:22 - to say select all now I could say
13:26 - something like var I equals 0 I is less
13:29 - than paragraphs dot length I plus plus
13:34 - and now I could say paragraphs now I'm
13:38 - going to index I something now here's
13:41 - the thing I want this is this is really
13:45 - exciting because what I'm saying to you
13:47 - here is let's say you have a thousand
13:49 - paragraphs on a page and you want to
13:51 - assign the same event to all of it so
13:53 - ever you hover over any of them they
13:55 - sparkle or they change color or they get
13:57 - really small or they disappear whatever
13:59 - that event is there's a path to doing
14:02 - that and that's actually the topic of
14:04 - the next video but it's a little extra
14:06 - concept here that we're missing so in
14:08 - order to simplify here right now I'm
14:10 - just gonna do something like say style
14:12 - and I'll say a font size 16 and 24 point
14:21 - so what this is allowing me to do is any
14:25 - paragraphs that are on the page I can
14:28 - just quickly I'm able to access all of
14:30 - them and call a function on them so you
14:32 - can see that if I just keep adding
14:34 - paragraphs right you know like this all
14:42 - of them are getting that size now let's
14:46 - just take this one step further let's
14:49 - change this from instead of selecting
14:51 - all by the paragraph tag let's select
14:55 - all by the rainbow class and we go back
15:01 - to the HTML file and you know orange
15:03 - apple apple orange so you can see the
15:10 - first the third fourth the fifth a bunch
15:13 - of those have the rainbow class
15:19 - and I'll just change the content of
15:21 - these two so now you can see only the
15:24 - elements that are of the class rainbow
15:27 - now have that font size so you could
15:30 - select by an individual one using select
15:33 - by ID you could select all of them all
15:37 - of the paragraphs by a given tag or you
15:39 - can select a group of elements with a
15:42 - given class and incidentally what if I
15:47 - make this button also a member of the
15:51 - rainbow class you can see the button
15:55 - they don't have to be the classes don't
15:57 - have to apply the same kind of element
15:59 - so if you say select all P you're only
16:02 - going to get paragraphs if you say
16:04 - select all dot rainbow that class could
16:07 - go across paragraphs and images and divs
16:09 - and buttons so you can group elements
16:12 - together that way so I think this is got
16:14 - a little bit scattered but this idea
16:16 - here is how you can now start to think
16:19 - so what I would say to you is fine
16:21 - something you made or make something new
16:22 - makes it take the thing you made already
16:24 - make all of your Dom elements in the
16:26 - HTML file give all of them an ID give
16:29 - some of them a class then go to your
16:31 - JavaScript program and try to select
16:33 - something by just its ID try to select
16:37 - some a group of elements by a class and
16:40 - see how you can get to see how that goes
16:43 - for you and in the next video what I
16:45 - want to look at is how you could select
16:47 - by a class you could get like a thousand
16:50 - elements and how you could assign a
16:52 - callback to all of those without having
16:54 - to write a thousand callback functions
16:56 - and that is my friend this is going to
16:59 - be a good moment to expand your
17:02 - knowledge and things you can do with
17:03 - JavaScript and programming okay so this
17:05 - is the this was a particularly long
17:07 - video and I'm gonna take a break and
17:10 - make the next one
