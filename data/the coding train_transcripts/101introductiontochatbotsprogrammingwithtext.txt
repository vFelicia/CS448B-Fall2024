00:00 - hello welcome to a new video series
00:05 - about chatbots so this series is going
00:07 - to find itself in my programming with
00:10 - text quartz which I started about a year
00:13 - ago and made a whole bunch of videos for
00:14 - now year later I want to add some
00:16 - content to it and so what I want to add
00:18 - is about check BOTS so I want to okay so
00:21 - first of all what is a chat bot so I'm
00:23 - gonna use the Wikipedia definition which
00:25 - says a chat bot is a computer program
00:27 - which conducts a conversation via
00:29 - auditory or textual methods so this is
00:31 - the kind of thing that's already in a
00:33 - lot of my examples where you know users
00:35 - are typing in text and it gets processed
00:37 - and some other text comes out maybe on a
00:39 - web page I have this whole series on
00:41 - Twitter BOTS those Twitter BOTS you
00:43 - could consider chat BOTS that
00:44 - conversation might be just one way it's
00:47 - a bot that just tweets once an hour says
00:49 - something to the audience nobody replies
00:51 - or it could be a one-to-many
00:52 - conversation where anytime somebody
00:55 - tweets at the Twitter bot the bot
00:57 - replies with something it could be two
00:59 - BOTS talking to each other so the chat
01:01 - bot is this is a brook this is a broader
01:03 - term than things that I've actually
01:04 - looked at before I've just looked at
01:06 - specific kinds of chat BOTS without
01:08 - mentioning the word chat bot so now what
01:10 - I do is say like well what if we really
01:12 - think about a computer program having a
01:14 - conversation with a human and can we
01:16 - achieve that with in the browser with
01:18 - open source tools can we also then once
01:21 - we do that think about oh we could make
01:23 - stuff for a commercial medium like
01:26 - Twitter or it could be a voice
01:29 - conversational interface with hello Siri
01:34 - apparently these markers are not smart
01:37 - markers
01:38 - somebody will invent that though where I
01:40 - can just ask my marker a question but no
01:41 - problem alexa expo what is the weather
01:49 - today in new york okay apparently my
01:54 - little expo whiteboard spray marker it
01:58 - would have been nice if this was really
01:59 - spontaneous but i did this earlier and
02:02 - I'm remaking this video trying to make
02:03 - this jokes Mantes it's not working
02:05 - okay so but I forgot that I had
02:07 - appreciation that I was doing a chat pod
02:09 - is a computer
02:10 - that's the conversation via auditory or
02:12 - textual method so I want to get to all
02:13 - this stuff on a look at some open source
02:15 - tools mix up having the browser I want
02:17 - to see can we do stuff with voice and
02:18 - speech recognition can we interface with
02:21 - commercial products that I'm now
02:23 - apparently buzz marketing for free
02:25 - beautifully in this video so there's
02:29 - there's a long history of this tradition
02:31 - of computers having conversations and by
02:34 - no means is this I'm now about to give
02:35 - you a presentation of the history of
02:36 - this and I'll try to include some links
02:38 - in particular to a an article that that
02:41 - actually gives you a history of chat
02:42 - BOTS that it's a wonderful article that
02:45 - I'll link to in this video's description
02:46 - but lives are probably being one of the
02:49 - most famous ones from 1966 and it's
02:52 - simulated conversation using pattern
02:53 - matching and substitution so this is
02:55 - something that I want to type what are
02:56 - the different techniques for making a
02:59 - chat bot how do you determine how does
03:01 - the bot the computer program understand
03:03 - what the person said how does the bot
03:05 - reply is it hard-coded typed replies is
03:08 - it machine learning neural network
03:10 - generated replies these are some things
03:11 - that I won't explore in these videos
03:13 - another famous example is Alice from
03:16 - 1995 artificial linguistic internet
03:18 - computer and Tina is the best acronym
03:21 - ever well this is why I want to mention
03:23 - Alice is with Alice came something
03:25 - called AI ml artificial intelligence
03:28 - markup language so a markup language
03:30 - essentially for writing a script for a
03:33 - chat bot so if the user says this the
03:35 - chat bot says this that the user says
03:36 - this the chat bot says this and the
03:38 - script looks something like this so
03:40 - there can be this idea of a pattern as
03:43 - well as a there could be this idea of
03:46 - setting a topic or reply templates this
03:49 - whole kind of so this is a I encourage
03:51 - you to investigate this at Alice pot org
03:53 - the reason why I'm mentioning this is my
03:56 - first video is gonna start using
03:57 - something called rive script which is an
03:59 - open source chat bot brain making tool
04:03 - kind of similar to with the zones from
04:07 - markup and syntax similar to Alice so
04:10 - these are some important considerations
04:12 - this is that article that I was
04:13 - referring to so I highly recommend you
04:16 - go and read it if you want to kind of
04:17 - learn a bit about the history of chat
04:19 - bots and also where this idea of deep
04:21 - learning
04:22 - neural networks could possibly fit in
04:24 - which I will get to in a future video
04:26 - but some things you really want to think
04:27 - about are models of conversation so
04:31 - retrieval versus generative so I'm gonna
04:33 - start with retrieval based systems which
04:35 - are much simpler meaning I just have
04:37 - like this script of what the bots can
04:39 - say and I'm trying to match some sort of
04:41 - pattern of what the user is saying and
04:42 - reply in a given way versus a generative
04:44 - system where I might have an algorithm
04:46 - that spot that generates what the what
04:48 - the bot says in any way whatsoever long
04:52 - versus short conversations I want to
04:54 - stick with short conversations so how do
04:56 - I make a bot that just can tell a
04:58 - knock-knock joke or respond to a
04:59 - knock-knock joke that's a short
05:01 - conversation or guess a guess a number
05:04 - that's actually one of the examples I'll
05:05 - make in a future video of that's already
05:08 - been hey that's what I'm able to
05:09 - reference it about a chat bot that you
05:13 - that thinks of a number and you try to
05:14 - guess it open versus closed domain so
05:17 - are you making a chat bot that's like
05:19 - just about how to order you know
05:20 - ordering a pizza versus I am a
05:22 - psychology bot and talk to me about any
05:24 - of your problems I will respond so
05:26 - completely open domain so again I want
05:29 - to start with to learn about chat BOTS
05:31 - and be able to prototype and make things
05:33 - quickly and easily I want to I'm gonna
05:35 - start with short closed retrieval based
05:38 - systems but hopefully as this video
05:40 - series expands I might be able to
05:41 - investigate generative systems longer
05:43 - conversations more open open domain
05:46 - conversations and again a lot of my
05:47 - refresh my learning and references about
05:50 - this came from this wonderful article
05:51 - here so write script this is where I'm
05:54 - gonna start I like to try to use open
05:56 - source free things as much as possible
05:58 - although I think to really push
06:00 - experiments in this conversational
06:03 - interface direction a voice stuff we're
06:05 - gonna have to at some point use some
06:07 - things made by large company as an
06:08 - interface with their API is similar to
06:10 - what I did with Twitter so rice Script
06:13 - is great because it's a simple scripting
06:15 - language it's based off of this idea of
06:17 - artificial intelligence markup language
06:18 - but it's slightly different and even
06:19 - simpler
06:20 - it just has a handful of simple rules
06:22 - I'm gonna try to go through some of them
06:23 - with you but honestly I'll show you the
06:26 - page where it just describes all the
06:27 - rules it's kind of thing you're gonna
06:28 - want to read yourself it's open-source
06:30 - license to MIT so you can use it for
06:33 - it's very
06:34 - open-source permissive license and you
06:37 - can use it with a variety of programming
06:38 - languages go java javascript perl python
06:40 - maybe more but so I'm going to use it
06:42 - with JavaScript so in the next if you
06:44 - keep watching this this is why I've last
06:46 - look at this I made a slide presentation
06:47 - aren't I
06:48 - aren't ia good presenter of things on
06:51 - the internet with my slide presentation
06:54 - so if you continue to watch these videos
06:56 - we'll have a slide presentation again I
06:59 - will start by just talking you through
07:01 - the basics of arrive script I will then
07:03 - make a look at using write script in the
07:07 - browser with JavaScript and eventually
07:09 - I'm going to look at it with some a
07:11 - library called p5 speech which allows me
07:13 - to further for me to use speech to text
07:16 - and text to speech from the browser and
07:18 - then eventually move past that as well
07:20 - so I hope you watch some of these
07:21 - chatbot videos and make some stuff and
07:23 - give me your feedback
07:29 - [Music]
