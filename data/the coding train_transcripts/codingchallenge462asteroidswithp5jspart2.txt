00:00 - welcome to part 2 of my asteroids coding
00:02 - challenge if you watch the previous one
00:05 - I have I had a ship and I had asteroids
00:07 - but no pew pew pew pew pew lasers so in
00:11 - this particular second part of the
00:12 - coding challenge I'm going to add the
00:13 - lasers which hit the asteroids and break
00:15 - them up into small pieces and don't
00:17 - forget if you're interested in a machine
00:20 - learning after I finish this video which
00:23 - I've already finished I don't know I've
00:24 - got some time-travel thing going on you
00:25 - can go to the link in the description to
00:28 - Suraj's channel where he has will have
00:31 - at some point soon a video word that
00:33 - trains a bot to play my asteroids game
00:35 - okay
00:35 - so enjoy part two of this asteroids
00:37 - challenge did I do okay so let's see if
00:42 - we can manage to add that so I'm going
00:45 - to add a another javascript file call it
00:47 - laser Jas and here what I want is once
00:55 - again I need a position and I need a
01:00 - velocity and I need an update function I
01:04 - need all the same sort of things which
01:07 - is this dot position dot add this dot
01:10 - velocity and so and then I need a render
01:13 - function and I'm just going to draw it
01:20 - as a point this dot point this this dot
01:29 - X this dot Y and a stroke 255 I'm going
01:35 - to say stroke wait for to make it a
01:37 - little bit thicker and so now if what I
01:40 - need also now just the same way I made
01:42 - the asteroids I need and you know what
01:45 - hmm I'm tempted to put these in the ship
01:48 - object like the ship keep tracks of its
01:51 - own lasers but just for simplicity sake
01:53 - I'm going to make an array out here so
01:57 - I'm going to make an array and I'm going
02:01 - to in draw just like with the asteroids
02:04 - I'm going to loop through all the lasers
02:08 - the laster's the lasers and I'm going to
02:11 - render and update them the
02:13 - doesn't need an edges function and now
02:16 - when do I create them so I want to let's
02:18 - say I want to create them when I hit the
02:20 - spacebar so I don't know what the key
02:23 - code is for the spacebar but I can also
02:24 - just say if key equals space so I can
02:30 - add to this key pressed function and I
02:32 - can say lasers dot push new laser now
02:37 - here's the thing where should the laser
02:40 - start
02:41 - well the laser should start wherever the
02:44 - ship is so I actually in this case want
02:47 - to pass something in to that laser
02:49 - constructor and I want to pass ship dot
02:52 - position so I want to say create a laser
02:55 - where the ship is so now if I go into
02:58 - that laser I can receive an argument
03:01 - like a ship pas ship I could just call
03:05 - this pup mount ship s pause for like
03:08 - ship position starting position and I
03:10 - can say create a vector s pause X s
03:13 - pause Y so I'm copying essentially by
03:16 - making a new vector with the same x and
03:18 - y and so now if i refresh this and I hit
03:23 - space ok laser is not defined
03:26 - I'm not going to ring the bells uh I now
03:30 - what I need to do is make sure I have a
03:33 - reference also to laser day s I add a
03:35 - new JavaScript file in my in my
03:39 - index.html file my brain is know thing
03:41 - about doing this for too long ok this is
03:43 - a long coding challenge ok here we go
03:45 - let's see spacebar oh look at that
03:48 - it changed the stroke weight of
03:50 - everything that was kind of exciting but
03:52 - but uh it did not I don't see any dots
03:58 - on the screen so let's let's have a look
04:00 - here let's look in the console for
04:02 - lasers I definitely added a bunch and
04:04 - their positions are on the screen why am
04:09 - I not seeing them so a couple things one
04:12 - is uh am i calling this dot render
04:18 - sketch j/s am i calling this dot render
04:22 - draw lasers I make our lasers that
04:26 - render
04:26 - I am lasers i dot render let's okay and
04:31 - oh you know what I did wrong this is
04:33 - like total nonsense this dot X and this
04:38 - dot Y doesn't exist what does the laser
04:40 - have it has a position vector and a
04:42 - velocity vector so this is this dot
04:44 - pause X and this dot pause dot Y and by
04:47 - the way let's add the push and pop here
04:50 - so that stroke weight doesn't affect
04:52 - anything else whoops
04:55 - and now I can it so you can see as I
04:57 - move it creates little dots where where
05:02 - the where the ship is now here's the
05:04 - thing I want those dots to move and I
05:06 - want them to point in the direction of
05:09 - the ship itself so in addition when I
05:12 - make one of these laser objects where
05:14 - did I do that right here and not only
05:16 - need to make it the laser with the
05:18 - ship's position but I should really pass
05:21 - in that heading as well right I want to
05:23 - give it the angle because the angle is
05:25 - going to tell it which way should it be
05:27 - pointing when it creates a vector to
05:29 - start moving so if I add ship dot
05:31 - heading to the constructor I can now say
05:36 - that's an angle that I'm getting in the
05:39 - laser I can say P five dot vector from
05:42 - angle angle now did I call update in the
05:47 - main sketch I don't want to make the
05:49 - same mistake I did so now we should have
05:55 - yeah they're kind of slow but they do
05:58 - work look at that this is fun okay so
06:05 - first of all they're coming out of the
06:06 - center which is a little bit weird
06:07 - should probably make them come out of
06:09 - the front but I could offset them I'm
06:10 - not going to worry about that too much I
06:11 - am going to make them move much faster
06:13 - though because that's ridiculously slow
06:15 - so I'm going to say this dot velocity
06:18 - dot multiply I'm going to multiply it by
06:21 - like ten so they're ten times as fast
06:24 - that's really fast and you know I could
06:29 - do a little trick I bet you won't notice
06:30 - if with the ship if I actually set when
06:34 - I draw the ship instead of no fill if I
06:37 - said it's fill to zero so I give it a
06:39 - black fill it's actually
06:40 - cover over the lasers as long as in
06:43 - sketch j/s mi-mi-mi-mi wherever I need
06:50 - to make sure the ship is drawn after the
06:53 - lasers so that it covers them now we
06:56 - should see yeah that looks a little bit
06:59 - better so now all I need to do is figure
07:03 - out when the lasers hit those asteroids
07:07 - and when they hit the asteroids
07:08 - I need the asteroids to break apart ooh
07:11 - this is exciting
07:14 - okay here we go here we go
07:16 - so ah boy so many features I think this
07:18 - might be the last feature I'm going to
07:19 - do so I need I do need some kind of
07:22 - collision detection here um so how do I
07:24 - do that well here is a loop where I
07:28 - here's a loop where I am looping over
07:30 - all the asteroids here's a loop where
07:32 - I'm looping over all the lasers I need
07:34 - to check every single laser against
07:37 - every single asteroid right I need to do
07:39 - something like if lasers index eye hits
07:45 - asteroids index J right for every laser
07:51 - I check every single asteroid hmm now
07:54 - here's the thing I need another loop so
07:56 - I need my asteroids loop inside inside
08:01 - the lasers loop mm-hmm oh and this
08:04 - should be J I can't use I for both loops
08:06 - otherwise my program will get wildly
08:08 - confused so now I'm saying now hits is
08:12 - not some automatic function that just
08:13 - exists I almost want to just like run
08:14 - this code and it'll work I'm writing up
08:16 - the code again to tell me what I need to
08:19 - put into my objects if I was using some
08:20 - kind of game programming framework or
08:22 - library there's one for p5 called p5
08:24 - play it might have collision detection
08:26 - built into it but I'm just going to do
08:28 - something simple here myself
08:29 - lasers index eye hits asteroids index J
08:32 - so that means in the laser object I need
08:35 - a function called hits that expects an
08:37 - asteroid object so I go to laser and I
08:40 - say this this dot hits equals function a
08:48 - asteroid and then now how do I determine
08:51 - if the two things are colliding
08:54 - well there's an actually easy way for me
08:56 - to do this because what I have is I have
08:59 - a like circular like thing and I have a
09:02 - dot so if this was a perfect circle I
09:05 - could just determine is the dot is the
09:08 - distance from the dot to the center less
09:11 - than the radius or greater than the
09:13 - radius if it's greater than the radius
09:14 - it's outside if it's less than the
09:16 - radius it's inside and you know it's
09:18 - going to be a slightly off for some of
09:19 - these jagged edges but it all happened
09:21 - so fast I bet no one will notice you
09:23 - could do like complex elaborate polygons
09:26 - thing yourself if you want write it in
09:28 - the comments and 7-year corrections okay
09:30 - so now I want to say var D equals
09:33 - distance which is a p5 function between
09:36 - this dot Paz X this dot Paz y and the
09:42 - asteroid dot Paz X asteroid Paz dot Y so
09:47 - I want the distance between the
09:49 - positions X Y and the asteroids that the
09:52 - laser is XY and the asteroids X Y if the
09:56 - distance is less than this dot R plus
09:59 - asteroid are the know this this doesn't
10:03 - have an are just the asteroids are if
10:05 - the distance is less than the asteroids
10:06 - radius then then it's colliding hit so
10:14 - I'm just going to and I'm gonna just
10:17 - console.log hit for a second and see if
10:19 - this works
10:21 - come on hit no I don't oh yeah is it
10:29 - actually working and I'm just losing my
10:30 - oh it is working
10:32 - I think it's been working all along I
10:34 - just like didn't actually hit any of
10:35 - them so you can see it's working sorry
10:39 - everybody
10:39 - whoo so the whole point of what I wanted
10:41 - to do here I'm not sure if some of that
10:43 - should have gotten edited out or not but
10:45 - it's working out has been working I just
10:48 - didn't have the console log in the right
10:49 - place or something ooh so what I
10:52 - actually want to do if you look at my
10:53 - sketch j/s is that if the laser sit I
10:57 - visit an if statement so I want that to
10:59 - evaluate to true or false so what I want
11:03 - to do is return true if that's the case
11:06 - now there's another thing I could
11:08 - actually
11:08 - return the result of D less than
11:10 - asteroid R but I like to be annoying and
11:13 - write extra code but I don't need to and
11:15 - also I just think for teaching purposes
11:17 - it's sort of something that makes a
11:19 - little more readable to see the whole
11:20 - thing written out because what I'm doing
11:22 - is I'm returning true or false based on
11:24 - whether the distances in that threshold
11:26 - or not so if it is within that threshold
11:28 - what do I need to do I need to do a
11:32 - couple things in sketch j/s I need to
11:36 - say asteroids index J like break up so
11:42 - what happens in the game asteroids when
11:43 - your laser hits the asteroid it like
11:45 - breaks into two smaller asteroids so how
11:49 - am I going to do that oh this is tricky
11:51 - tricky tricky boy this is not as easy as
11:53 - I thought
11:54 - okay so first of all one thing I need to
11:56 - do is I want to I think the way to do
11:58 - this is to remove derive an array of
12:01 - asteroids so I want to remove the bigger
12:03 - asteroid from the array and add two
12:05 - smaller ones in the same spot so what I
12:08 - can do is I can maybe have this function
12:10 - break up new asteroids return two new
12:16 - asteroids that are smaller but look the
12:18 - same and then what I can do is I can say
12:21 - asteroids dot push new asteroids so it's
12:29 - going to add and then what I want to do
12:30 - is say ask asteroids dot splice I comma
12:37 - one oops
12:40 - so by the way I'm using the wrong index
12:42 - here I goes with lasers J goes with
12:45 - asteroids so this has to be J and this
12:49 - has to be J as well okay so up above
12:53 - above so now this should work the same
12:57 - issues here first of all I have to write
12:58 - this function break up that generates
13:00 - two new asteroids so this won't work
13:02 - let's do that first
13:03 - so I need to go to the asteroid object
13:05 - and I need to write a function called
13:07 - this that break up equals function and
13:10 - I'm going to say var asked new a for new
13:15 - asteroids is an empty array so what I
13:19 - need to do is I basically need to
13:21 - two new asteroids at this particular
13:24 - location so this is an issue like the
13:27 - asteroids constructor function can does
13:33 - not receive any arguments I wanted to if
13:35 - it doesn't receive an argument create an
13:37 - asteroid at a random location if it does
13:40 - receive an argument create an asteroid
13:42 - at a specific location so I'm going to
13:44 - add an argument pause here and I'm going
13:46 - to say this dot pause equals pause let's
13:53 - see hmm um I'm just going to say right
13:57 - now if pause this dot pause equals pause
14:01 - I could be more efficient about this
14:04 - with like a an or kind of in the
14:06 - statement but just so what I want to say
14:07 - is if this constructor received an
14:11 - argument set its position to that
14:13 - position otherwise make a random
14:15 - position here's the problem though I
14:17 - don't want to just set the vectors equal
14:19 - to each other because they're objects
14:20 - and they will both actually point to the
14:22 - same object and things won't move
14:23 - properly so I need to make sure I copy
14:26 - this vector when I bring it in so this
14:29 - will create the asteroids at that
14:32 - location no there's a bunch more thing I
14:33 - need to add here but let's just see how
14:35 - that does okay so and then so what I
14:40 - need to do here is say new a index 0
14:44 - equals new asteroid at this one's
14:51 - position and then a second one also at
14:56 - this one's position and then return
14:58 - those two so this should now give me two
15:02 - new asteroids whenever I hit one of them
15:05 - okay cannot read property ex of
15:07 - undefined lasered I bet you up missing
15:10 - on this or a pause laser J a slide 18
15:14 - laser J s line 18 ah
15:19 - [Music]
15:20 - whoa X of undefined oh okay there's a
15:25 - big problem here which is that I'm
15:27 - looping through the asteroids and adding
15:29 - new asteroids at the same time so that's
15:32 - really a big problem
15:35 - because I I'm gonna like I'm adding some
15:37 - asteroids then I'm gonna check those and
15:39 - I might add some more asteroids then I
15:40 - check those so I really need to loop
15:41 - through the array backwards so that when
15:43 - I add stuff I don't check them again so
15:45 - I'm going to start the loop at asteroids
15:47 - length minus one go all the way to J is
15:51 - greater than or greater than or equal to
15:54 - zero and J minus - okay so that should
15:58 - help the other thing I'm going to do is
16:01 - I'm actually not going to add them right
16:02 - now because I want to just go say
16:04 - console dot log new aster new asteroids
16:12 - I'm getting some nice messages of tips
16:15 - in my chat okay
16:16 - so so I just want to see okay it's gone
16:20 - and I got and I'm seeing two new in the
16:23 - console so that's a good sign so I'm
16:26 - seeing two new asteroids and so I should
16:29 - be able to add those now but there's a
16:30 - problem when I add them the laser is
16:35 - going to be right there and it's going
16:37 - to be intersecting with those two new
16:39 - and then it's going to add two more so
16:40 - I'm gonna get to stuck the reason why
16:41 - confident as I could see this like
16:43 - recursive loop happening or laser hits
16:45 - asteroid Laser disaster and laser
16:46 - asteroid and it's going to go crazy so
16:49 - fortunately what I need to do here is
16:51 - also loop through the lasers backwards I
16:59 - - - and then I also need to say lasers
17:04 - dot splice I comma one right I want to
17:11 - remove that one laser so let's see if
17:13 - that works now oops okay cannot read
17:18 - property hits of undefined so I think
17:21 - this is not working properly oh I forgot
17:24 - to push them in no where did that happen
17:28 - oh so many bugs sketch - line 26 so my
17:32 - asteroids are undefined for oh the
17:35 - lasers are undefined for whatever reason
17:37 - because I'm removing it and oh look at
17:44 - this you know what this is kind of
17:46 - unbelievable
17:47 - but there's
17:49 - a problem here where I need to just
17:50 - break out of this loop I'm done with
17:52 - that laser so I so I need to just hit a
17:56 - break because I think I'm going back and
18:00 - checking things that don't exist anymore
18:01 - let's try that yes there we go so now
18:06 - you can see the laser and the asteroid
18:08 - goes away and now I should be able to
18:10 - push okay so I thought of that in my
18:12 - head you might be wondering what did I
18:13 - just do the problem is I'm safe lasers
18:16 - index I and then I delete that laser
18:19 - immediately but I'm still in this loop
18:21 - because there's a bunch of asteroids
18:23 - that I'm checking for each laser so I
18:25 - need to make sure I like get out of that
18:26 - asteroids loop because I'm done
18:28 - immediately so break will do that for me
18:30 - I hope that makes sense so now I should
18:32 - be able to say asteroids push new
18:34 - asteroids and we should see uh asteroid
18:38 - stop Index Ida render is not a function
18:42 - okay so I removed the asteroids and and
18:50 - I was which loop and like breaking out
18:53 - up I'm breaking out of so let's look at
18:58 - the asteroids array and see what it
19:03 - looks like and I need to have a bit more
19:06 - room here okay oh look at this so it
19:13 - doesn't do what I thought it would do I
19:14 - just thought if I called bush and gave
19:16 - it an array it would add both them to
19:19 - the array but it doesn't actually do
19:21 - that it added a fourth element which is
19:23 - an array which is two so how do I add an
19:26 - array I thought push would do that but I
19:28 - guess it doesn't concatenate if there's
19:30 - like I concatenate two arrays together
19:33 - function right JavaScript concatenate
19:38 - two arrays I could also just write my
19:41 - own little loop concat method so can cat
19:45 - takes one array and can cat sit with the
19:48 - other one okay so what I want to do this
19:52 - should work that I should be able to say
19:55 - instead of push asteroids equals
19:59 - asteroids concat the
20:02 - asteroids so merge those two arrays
20:04 - together oops I'm in the wrong place
20:07 - here we go let's see how if I get this
20:13 - to work
20:13 - all right now it's splitting apart now
20:16 - here's the thing in addition to having
20:19 - them split apart they should get smaller
20:23 - so what I want to do is in the asteroids
20:28 - I should also optionally receive an R
20:31 - value and I should say if R and let's
20:42 - just have it always be divided by two so
20:46 - times 0.5 whoops I lost what I had there
20:49 - so if it's not receiving an R value it's
20:52 - a random value if it is I get R times
20:55 - 0.5 so now they should be getting
20:58 - smaller each time oops that didn't look
21:03 - like that worked okay I can't tell let
21:09 - this is a big one well you know what it
21:11 - is here's the other thing
21:13 - oh the offsets the offsets are always
21:17 - between negative 15 and 15 they really
21:20 - should be a function of the R itself it
21:23 - should be between negative this R and
21:27 - and positive this dot R so like the
21:30 - offset maybe also times 0.5 so it can't
21:36 - so the offset because as I get smaller
21:39 - the offset shouldn't be as much I should
21:41 - probably just use scale why are they not
21:46 - getting much smaller let's see oh that
21:49 - seemed to work what am I missing here
21:53 - okay
21:55 - do I
21:58 - I forgot to add it so I didn't actually
22:00 - pass in the vert the value so when I
22:03 - make the tube at new asteroids not only
22:05 - do I need you can't just like put
22:07 - something there and then forget to call
22:08 - it as I seem to do a lot this dot R this
22:11 - dot R do this for the little so I don't
22:14 - I don't know anyone still watching this
22:15 - but this out are this dot R okay so now
22:18 - that should get me what I want which is
22:21 - there we go they're smaller look at that
22:23 - each time I hit them they're smaller now
22:26 - I could also copy the offsets so the
22:28 - shapes are exactly the same but this is
22:31 - sort of close enough for me the other
22:33 - thing is once I get to a certain size
22:34 - they should just be removed so another
22:38 - thing that I should do is in sketch j/s
22:42 - is I should have some sort of threshold
22:43 - and I should say as long as asteroids
22:48 - index J dot R is greater than what's a
22:52 - good R let's say 10 as long as it's
22:54 - greater than 10 then you can do all this
22:57 - breaking up stuff otherwise increase the
23:01 - score you know otherwise do nothing
23:05 - increase the score so I'm still always
23:08 - going to remove the asteroid and the
23:09 - laser but I only want to like double it
23:11 - if there are actually I should always be
23:12 - increasing the score because so whatever
23:15 - so I only want to do that if the
23:17 - asteroids are greater than 10 so now
23:18 - let's try to play this a little bit 10
23:25 - is really small but you can see they're
23:28 - gone after a certain amount I getting
23:34 - distracted by playing this game ok this
23:36 - is totally fun ok I think basically I've
23:40 - done everything now except for one thing
23:42 - I should probably add something where
23:45 - you die maybe not die you just start
23:49 - over do something different if the ship
23:51 - hits the asteroids and this will be the
23:53 - last feature that I'm going to add in
23:55 - this coding challenge ok so now what I
23:59 - need is somewhere out here in the
24:02 - asteroids loop I could say if ship dot
24:07 - hits asteroids index I
24:10 - then uh I'm just gonna consult I look
24:15 - I'm just gonna add a console dot log
24:17 - because I'm feeling tired this will be
24:20 - an exercise console dot log
24:23 - oops so I need to now add a function in
24:29 - ship which says this dot hits equals a
24:36 - function which expects an asteroid and I
24:38 - can also calculate the distance again
24:40 - between this pause X this type of dot Y
24:45 - asteroid pause X asteroid pause Y and
24:50 - now now if d is less than I'm like
25:00 - losing my mind here this dot R right
25:03 - plus asteroid R so I'll just add the two
25:07 - like cite you one's a triangle once a
25:09 - strange polygon this isn't exactly right
25:11 - but it's pretty close I'm going to say
25:13 - return true otherwise return false and
25:16 - now here we go let's just see we're
25:20 - going to look in the in the console if I
25:23 - died let's see if I can win this game I
25:27 - should probably test it sooner than
25:28 - later but I haven't died yet okay I'm
25:34 - getting hit so you can see that I'm
25:36 - getting hit so I've got something close
25:38 - enough I could change I should actually
25:39 - probably like drop change its color
25:41 - something so we could sort of see some
25:43 - visual feedback but this is the basic
25:45 - game mechanic so remember here there I
25:49 - did it go to challenge programmed
25:52 - asteroids in JavaScript using the p5 GS
25:55 - framework in the browser I would love it
25:59 - if anybody takes this game the code for
26:02 - this will be on github and I hope I
26:04 - might try to make a code pen out of it
26:06 - as well
26:06 - so look in this video's description you
26:08 - can find the code play with it tweet me
26:10 - a revision add stuff for me like what I
26:13 - need to do now because this as I
26:15 - mentioned at the beginning of this video
26:16 - this asteroids game is part one of a
26:19 - collaboration with Suraj Suraj has a
26:22 - YouTube channel who can make
26:24 - videos about machine learning and I'm
26:26 - going to pass this game off to him and
26:28 - he's going to train a bot to play it and
26:30 - get a super high score so the bots going
26:32 - to learn how to turn the ship push it
26:33 - shoot you know destroy all the asteroids
26:36 - so I need to add really just like a
26:38 - score mechanism and alive lives
26:40 - mechanism so if anybody wants to
26:41 - volunteer to do that
26:42 - you can you can fork its code on github
26:45 - make some variations on it and I'll pass
26:49 - that off to Suraj and I'll see you in
26:51 - another coding challenge oh wait don't
26:59 - go anywhere I forgot something in the
27:02 - patreon chat on slack somebody points
27:05 - out my lasers array is getting just
27:07 - bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
27:08 - this is a definite problem so I do need
27:11 - to do something which also says this
27:15 - video is not over you thought it was
27:16 - over
27:17 - I really should add something that says
27:19 - if lasers index I off-screen then also
27:27 - laser splice I index one so I'm going to
27:31 - do that I'm going to do that uh yeah I
27:37 - think if I just do that here that should
27:39 - be ok but if I've already removed it
27:43 - here that's fine I'm just checking the
27:45 - next one that's fine I think we'll see
27:48 - so I'm gonna now now I need an add a
27:49 - function and it's actually very similar
27:51 - to the edges function so I'm going to
27:53 - look for like one of the edges function
27:55 - in like ship and I'm going to go into
27:59 - laser and I'm going to say this
28:02 - off-screen equals function if pause dot
28:06 - X is great I don't need any of this this
28:08 - dot R stuff just if it's greater than
28:10 - with this is probably more trouble and
28:12 - it's worth less than zero if it's
28:17 - greater than height or less than zero
28:23 - if any of these are true and I can put
28:26 - these together in or which maybe I'll do
28:27 - here so or this
28:32 - return it true if it's either one of
28:38 - these this is a really ridiculous way of
28:42 - writing this then also return true
28:49 - otherwise digit to the return false so
28:55 - let's now look at what I want to do now
28:58 - just to see that this is working is I
29:00 - want a console log
29:02 - Lazer's dot length to see if that array
29:05 - is growing or shrinking so and also I
29:09 - think I have some extra weird console
29:10 - logs somewhere but that's fine so we
29:12 - should see there's zero lasers right now
29:15 - and does it get back to zero yeah now
29:19 - it's back to zero so you can see this is
29:22 - working great so now that laser array
29:24 - oops uh off screen of undefined ah
29:28 - sketch as line 39 so ah if it doesn't
29:33 - exist because it possibly could have
29:36 - been removed here this is this is a oh
29:44 - you don't I can just do is here and then
29:47 - I can break so if it's off-screen no no
29:51 - that's go to the next one don't bother
29:53 - otherwise there's got to be a better way
29:56 - to write this this is like the it's like
29:58 - an hour into this video ah nobody's
30:00 - watching this anyway anymore
30:02 - so I got to think of a better way to do
30:03 - this but my brain has melted but so what
30:05 - I'm doing is I'm saying if it's off the
30:06 - screen get rid of it otherwise you can
30:08 - start to check at it check check against
30:10 - all these asteroids and that should fix
30:11 - that problem I don't know why my eye
30:13 - tubes opened people are going to start
30:15 - complaining now that I'm using a Mac I
30:17 - get back at that good played a lot so
30:19 - now I should be able to say uh you know
30:22 - the lasers are now that array is not I'm
30:27 - trying to win this game hmm
30:31 - oh you don't need to watch me play this
30:34 - game anymore I'll play it on my own time
30:36 - thanks for watching this coding
30:37 - challenge go and watch as soon as it's
30:40 - available there'll be a link in this
30:41 - video's description to Suraj's video
30:43 - where he trains a
30:45 - to play this game I'm super excited to
30:47 - see how that works and what happens and
30:49 - I hope to see you back in another video
30:51 - sometime soon thanks again
