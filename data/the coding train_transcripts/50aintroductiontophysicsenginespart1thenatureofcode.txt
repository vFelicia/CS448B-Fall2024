00:00 - hello welcome to the first video in a
00:03 - playlist about physics engines now
00:05 - strangely enough this video that I'm
00:06 - making right now that you are watching
00:09 - because somehow you are is made in 2017
00:14 - but the next videos that follow in this
00:17 - playlist were made several years ago and
00:19 - those videos cover two specific engine
00:21 - physics engines box2d and toxic lives so
00:24 - what I want to do in this video is kind
00:26 - of make a little update to what's the
00:29 - state of physics engines today what are
00:31 - physics engines what are some examples
00:32 - physics engines that you might be
00:34 - interested in what are some of the
00:35 - features of them how do they work and
00:37 - then if you are keep it being interested
00:39 - you can continue and watch them the more
00:40 - specific tutorials at the very end of
00:42 - this playlist you'll find some new
00:44 - updated physics and Guice tutorials with
00:48 - some newer physics engines that I've
00:49 - only started recently looking at most
00:51 - notably a JavaScript one that runs in
00:53 - the browser called mater dodging this is
00:56 - an example of a processing sketch a
00:59 - computer program drawing graphics to the
01:02 - screen and using a physics engine behind
01:05 - the scenes to figure out what is when do
01:08 - things collide what should they do after
01:10 - they collide all of the motion and
01:13 - animation the location position velocity
01:16 - angle all of the stuff that's telling me
01:18 - what to draw in this is a convention
01:22 - that makes no sense whatsoever let me
01:24 - try to make this make sense okay so if
01:27 - you've watched any of my previous
01:29 - tutorial videos one of the many and many
01:33 - exist many programming tutorials this is
01:35 - a thing that I do I have a variable
01:37 - let's say I'm writing code in JavaScript
01:39 - I have a variable called X maybe and
01:43 - then somewhere in an animation loop like
01:45 - the draw function in PJs I might say
01:47 - something like x equals x plus 1 and
01:50 - what that gives you is if I want to draw
01:54 - something at that particular X location
01:56 - maybe at a Y location of 100 if I
01:59 - increment its location every frame it's
02:02 - going to start to move this in a way is
02:04 - a physics engine
02:05 - what's the world of physics it's a very
02:08 - holistic world things can only move at a
02:09 - constant velocity on one dimension by
02:12 - one unit every moment of time but
02:14 - ultimately this is a physics engine now
02:16 - if you follow some of my other tutorials
02:17 - I start to add in a lot more things like
02:21 - a lie and maybe I start using a concept
02:23 - called a vector whether it's a P vector
02:25 - and processing or a p5 dot vector and
02:27 - then I'll start to have things like oh
02:29 - there's a position and there's a
02:30 - velocity and there's an acceleration and
02:32 - there's a force and so and then
02:35 - acceleration positive opt-ins allowed to
02:36 - go to the position all of this kind of
02:38 - stuff to to formalize and encode a
02:44 - framework a system for how things move
02:46 - around a computer screen models off of
02:49 - the way things generally pretty much
02:51 - move in the real world you know lots of
02:54 - scientific caveats aside so this is the
02:57 - trajectory that you'll find if you go
02:59 - back and watch a lot of my nature Code
03:01 - video tutorials or even a lot of the
03:03 - coding challenges where I'm moving in
03:05 - animating things in a computer graphics
03:06 - window now what is some day so you know
03:11 - this bit will get any pretty far and
03:13 - it's actually a really nice way to work
03:15 - because I have total control to invent
03:17 - my own creative take on physics and and
03:19 - different kind of behaviors and make
03:21 - creatures that have thoughts and desires
03:23 - and all sorts of things could leave you
03:25 - do a lot of exciting interesting things
03:27 - but there are moments where you might
03:28 - think to yourself up all of this vector
03:31 - math and I got to do a collision and
03:33 - suddenly you know I want to know what
03:35 - happens when this strange polygon
03:38 - collides with the circle and if it
03:40 - bounced off this way you know you're
03:41 - starting to go down this road and
03:43 - suddenly you're you know spending years
03:45 - of your life developing these very
03:47 - elaborate sophisticated algorithms to
03:49 - figure out how to make things move based
03:51 - on a physics and these are not new
03:54 - problems and so there are library
03:57 - frameworks that you can import into your
03:59 - code to eliminate the need for you to
04:02 - write the lines of code where you add
04:05 - velocity to position or add acceleration
04:07 - to velocity and all you do the way that
04:10 - a physics engine generally works is you
04:12 - can think of this as the physics engine
04:15 - it's a box
04:16 - and in some ways it's a black box you
04:19 - don't have to
04:19 - know how it works inside to make use of
04:21 - it although that you know it's kind of
04:24 - hard to just use one without some of
04:26 - this basic sensibility and having done
04:28 - some of this yourself to understand
04:29 - about forces and vectors and all that
04:31 - kind of things because these concepts
04:32 - are all embedded in physics engines but
04:34 - if you have this black box you have a
04:37 - moment writing in your program like the
04:39 - cameras over here but I'm over here do
04:41 - you see me there's a moment where you
04:44 - have the program start and you say hey
04:46 - world of the thing that I'm making I
04:48 - would like you to have some circles
04:51 - floating at the top of the screen and
04:53 - then maybe your rectangle at the bottom
04:54 - and then you should have this little
04:56 - like spinning wheel and then I'm just
04:58 - going to say go so it's the idea where
05:01 - the physics engine is that you have this
05:02 - kind of setup where you tell the world
05:05 - what should be in it so in setup you
05:09 - might say here's what I imagine the
05:11 - world to be it starts with in one of the
05:13 - coding challenges I hope to do that'll
05:15 - be in a future video let's Plinko so I
05:17 - want to have you know a bunch of static
05:21 - knobs in the window and then I want to
05:24 - have a thing that's at the top and then
05:27 - I want to have some buckets at the box
05:29 - what's a weird example okay so it's all
05:32 - about him setup it's saying here's
05:34 - what's going to be in the world then you
05:37 - tell the physics engine here's all the
05:39 - things here's where they are here are
05:41 - their sizes and then you say go and then
05:44 - there's this animation each the draw
05:47 - loop in processing or p5 every moment in
05:49 - time and what you do every moment in
05:51 - time you can say all physics engine
05:53 - where is the stuff so you set up world
06:00 - the things are all of the things of like
06:03 - moving the stuff around checking if it's
06:05 - colliding and then if it's colliding and
06:06 - velocity changes all of that is done
06:08 - inside of this so-called black box the
06:11 - physics engine and you're only driving
06:13 - to say where is everything now I would
06:15 - like to draw it so this is the paradigm
06:17 - that you'll find in physics engine after
06:19 - physics engine and there's a bunch that
06:21 - I want to discuss and talk about so let
06:23 - me make a list of different physics
06:25 - engine
06:25 - talk about some of their features so
06:27 - box2d being one of the more famous
06:30 - well-known physics engines that's behind
06:32 - a lot of well-known games like Katniss
06:36 - or 2d mobile games like Angry Birds fill
06:39 - in all the other ones after that box
06:42 - duty there's a physics engine and
06:44 - actually something called toxic lives
06:46 - which is promising but what started at
06:49 - specifically a to start it specifically
06:51 - for processing a Java library is
06:54 - actually a much broader law library
06:56 - beyond physics but one of its components
06:59 - is a simple physics engine we'll have
07:03 - there is something called a Bullock
07:06 - which is a physics engine specifically
07:08 - for 3d there is a physics engine I want
07:12 - to look at called matter AF cannon is is
07:17 - another one that I recently found and
07:19 - the list goes on so I'm sure I'm missing
07:21 - you know your favorite physics engine or
07:24 - a really good one or one that's really
07:26 - useful in this particular context or for
07:29 - this particular programming language but
07:30 - this is a list of ones that I know
07:33 - something about or that I find useful in
07:36 - some context whatsoever so one thing
07:39 - that might consider for you over there
07:41 - you watching keep your run away I would
07:43 - totally understand one thing that you
07:46 - might consider is whether you can do
07:48 - this in 2d or 3d
07:50 - so box 2d is noted by the name is 2d
07:55 - only 2d toxic lives has both 2d and 3d
08:01 - physics bullet is a 3d physics engine
08:05 - matter chess is 2d and Canon EF is 3d so
08:10 - I don't know why they all get an
08:11 - exclamation point but they're very
08:12 - excited about their number of dimensions
08:14 - I have a 2d for the Glendon another
08:17 - thing that you might think about which
08:18 - physics engine is what eaters do they
08:22 - have so you know what language is a 2d
08:25 - or 3d but really keeping its features
08:26 - and actually I realized that this list
08:28 - is kind of useless I'll leave it there
08:31 - because what I want to just take a
08:33 - moment well you know I
08:35 - the kind of key teeth here which is if I
08:39 - if I need to tell the world what kinds
08:41 - of things are in it well how do I do
08:43 - that
08:44 - so what are the kinds of elements that
08:46 - go into the world so tip most almost all
08:49 - of these physics engines use the same
08:51 - paradigm which is and I'm going to use
08:54 - each visit as you might use a slightly
08:56 - different term for the same thing but
08:58 - for all these physics engines there's
09:00 - generally something called a world so
09:04 - the world is that thing that the world
09:06 - is the entire world of what you're the
09:08 - sort of space of physical space letters
09:10 - 2d or 3d that the entities that you're
09:13 - going to place in that world live it and
09:14 - it could have on you know it could have
09:17 - kind of global properties like it could
09:18 - have a global gravity it could have
09:21 - boundaries you know where things can't
09:24 - go outside us so typically most of these
09:26 - physics engines have a world the other
09:29 - thing these physics engines have
09:31 - typically is something called a body a
09:33 - body being an entity that goes into that
09:37 - world and it might be a circular body a
09:39 - rectangular body an arbitrary polygon
09:42 - type of body and I'm kind of conflating
09:46 - something though which is box2d
09:47 - in particular has two concepts which is
09:50 - a body and then a shape so the body
09:52 - meaning the sort of singular empty point
09:56 - that's flow think that's moving around
09:58 - through the space and a shape being
09:59 - actual physical geometry that's attached
10:01 - to it so we could think sort of but some
10:03 - of these physics edges that are a little
10:04 - less sophisticated are just it's sort of
10:06 - the same thing that body and shape are
10:08 - the same thing so body and shape the
10:10 - other thing that most of these physics
10:14 - engines have is something called trying
10:17 - to think of which term to use in box2d
10:19 - it's referred to as a joint in matter
10:22 - chess it's a constraint in toxic lives
10:24 - it's a spring and so I'm going to call
10:28 - it just a connection I'm going to call
10:29 - it a spring now let's call it the
10:31 - connection and so what I mean by that is
10:35 - what if you had as your physics engine
10:37 - there is a body and it's connected to
10:40 - another body
10:41 - that's swinging like a pendulum how can
10:43 - you have a constraint or a spring or a
10:45 - joint that
10:46 - ashes to body and it's kind of amazing
10:48 - what you can build just from that
10:51 - generically if I have a way of placing
10:54 - any kind of shapes in the world
10:55 - connecting them in some way that I want
10:57 - and then say go experience gravity
11:00 - bounce into each other interact with the
11:02 - valve experience of force there's a lot
11:05 - of such there's a lot of worlds you can
11:07 - create that are quite engaging exciting
11:09 - and to play with so so business these
11:12 - are kind of a teachers but there's a
11:14 - kind of key things books I certainly
11:16 - should have started this whole video if
11:17 - you're still watching good for you
11:19 - because here's the real thing I when you
11:23 - want to use the fence physics engine and
11:25 - when do you not want to use a physics
11:26 - engine and it's sort of like a strange
11:29 - question because no matter what you're
11:32 - using a physics engine the question I'm
11:34 - really asking is when do you want to
11:36 - just use your own custom baked x equals
11:39 - x plus one or position not add velocity
11:42 - or your own kind of cooked up mechanic
11:45 - for how things move around the space
11:48 - versus just use somebody else as a
11:51 - mechanic that you get you set up
11:53 - and then reap the benefits of as you
11:55 - draw things and there's no answer this
11:57 - question and most of the time you're in
12:00 - a sort of in-between space but there are
12:02 - a couple scenarios that I think are key
12:04 - scenarios when using a physics engine is
12:06 - incredibly valuable key scenario number
12:10 - one collisions collisions collision
12:12 - khalif's like it's like real estate
12:15 - location location location physics
12:17 - engine super collisions collisions
12:18 - collision so if I'm ever working on a
12:20 - project and I'm moving stuff and use
12:22 - exterior be hey VIIRS I add gravity and
12:24 - I've got all this stuff hooked up to my
12:25 - code that runs what I really need is for
12:27 - these shapes as they move around to
12:29 - bounce off of each other this is
12:30 - generally where I want to move towards
12:32 - using a physics engine because rather
12:34 - than spend you know hours and hours on
12:37 - stackoverflow and rejects your lots of
12:38 - Wikipedia pages to work out all sorts of
12:40 - geometry math and collision detection
12:43 - and resolution
12:44 - these are solved problems that are built
12:46 - into a lot of these physics engines so
12:48 - that's kind of arbitrary thing number
12:51 - one and where I am on this white board
12:52 - which is to use collisions not to use it
12:56 - to use a fixed engine if what you need
12:57 - is collision here's another place
13:00 - so I'm at what this what reminds me of
13:02 - this is this idea of physics engines
13:04 - having a world Abad work a world that's
13:07 - full of bodies and connections and so
13:10 - one thing that physics engines are very
13:11 - good at is if you want to build some
13:14 - type of simulation that's based on a
13:16 - connected system so uh and so some
13:21 - examples of this are cloth simulation
13:24 - and you know Oh cloth simulation how is
13:27 - that a connected system well actually a
13:29 - way and I have a coding challenge that
13:31 - I'll link to in here that builds the
13:32 - cloth simulation using the toxic little
13:35 - physics engine but you can think of well
13:37 - what is a cloth what if you had a lot of
13:39 - dots you're going to have to watch this
13:45 - video for a little bit while I draw a
13:46 - pollution pot and then what if you
13:48 - connected all of those dots with some
13:51 - sort of springy elastic connection joint
13:55 - spring and then you pulled on one and
13:59 - I'll show you a version of this in the
14:00 - middle I'll show you some example so
14:01 - this is the way then you textured it
14:03 - with color or whatever you that sort of
14:05 - thing so a cloth hair these types of
14:08 - connective a systems what if you wanted
14:10 - to make you know a cute cuddly character
14:16 - like this I don't know it's for ears and
14:19 - it's sort of like it's soft and it
14:21 - bounces and it jiggles that Wiggles
14:22 - around well you could film this by
14:25 - creating a set of particles perhaps that
14:29 - are connected with Springs and maybe
14:31 - some interior connections to keep it
14:34 - from collapsing on itself and that could
14:36 - be the skeleton physics behind this
14:39 - particular character and there are lots
14:40 - of examples so the other thing that's
14:42 - sort of key about using physics engines
14:44 - is you don't have the way you've set up
14:46 - the world and tell the physics engine
14:47 - what's in it could simply be a skeleton
14:50 - for what you lay on top of it you might
14:52 - say hey there's a lot of circles in this
14:54 - world but what you're going to draw are
14:56 - you know images of first that are
14:58 - Euler and there's a lot of rectangles in
15:00 - this world what you're going to draw our
15:02 - like little cardboard box textures wood
15:04 - box textures that type of thing so
15:05 - collision collision is a key thing and
15:10 - also connected systems so these kind of
15:12 - soft body simulation cloth simulation
15:16 - chain pendulum you know there's a lot of
15:21 - scenarios were this idea which a physics
15:24 - engine is going to kind of do a lot of
15:25 - this stuff for you it's a kind of known
15:27 - way of implementing something okay so
15:30 - what I want to do here is thinking about
15:33 - collisions and connected systems is I
15:36 - want to look at these and kind of think
15:38 - about which which what kind of features
15:41 - these engines have so box2d is like kind
15:44 - of amazing for collisions so if you want
15:47 - to work with collisions in two
15:49 - dimensions of any arbitrary geometry
15:52 - box2d does this incredibly well if you
15:55 - want to work with connected systems
15:57 - springy soft body simulation squash
16:01 - based simulations that type of thing
16:02 - possibly does this really well now you
16:05 - can do those constellations in box 2d
16:06 - the toxic lip is really just highly
16:09 - optimized towards this world of
16:11 - particles Springs and top eclipses has
16:13 - no collisions so toxic lives is
16:16 - just a particle spring based physics
16:20 - engine with no geometry whatsoever so in
16:23 - this sense if you want to work with so
16:24 - these are sort of features here bullet
16:27 - for 3d I actually really barely any
16:29 - experience whatsoever I just could be
16:30 - one example that use of a problem
16:32 - library for bullet but for 3d collisions
16:34 - you can use bullet for that and then
16:38 - matter gjs really I would say collisions
16:42 - and connected systems looking at it
16:44 - there's a lot of features for both of
16:46 - those things so you know you kind of I
16:48 - guess there's a puzzle here which is I'm
16:50 - working on a project that I want it to
16:54 - be in a browser and I wanted to just be
16:56 - a cloth simulation you know may be toxic
16:58 - lives is all you need well I'm working
17:01 - on a processing sketch and I really need
17:03 - to have I'm making a 2-d game where all
17:06 - the stuff is like bouncing off of it
17:07 - since all these like strange polygons
17:09 - well maybe I was using box2d
17:10 - but if I mean the browser and I kind of
17:12 - just won a very generic physics engine
17:15 - that has collisions and brick
17:17 - constraints and I'm like as mad as a
17:19 - chance so hopefully if you actually
17:21 - watch any of these videos and see some
17:23 - of the examples you'll see where some of
17:25 - the physics engines really shine and
17:26 - where others maybe aren't as as useful
17:29 - you know one thing I'll say in terms of
17:31 - degree of difficulty there's there's a
17:32 - level of complexity that the engine has
17:34 - in terms which is which you know if it
17:37 - has a high level of complexity that's
17:39 - really great in terms of possibilities
17:40 - but also makes the overhead of working
17:42 - with it so kind of extreme that
17:44 - sometimes not worth it you know if all
17:46 - you want is like a bouncing ball you
17:48 - know you don't really want to go through
17:49 - all of the rigmarole of importing all
17:51 - the box of thee libraries and learning
17:53 - how all the pieces work and you've got
17:54 - set up all this extra code but but in
17:57 - terms of seeing is this working with I
17:58 - would say boxing is probably one of the
17:59 - hardest on the Toxic lives in many ways
18:02 - is one of the easiest but you know it's
18:05 - a library for many years ago and there
18:06 - is finding the documentation examples is
18:08 - a bit difficult to do whether it's box2d
18:10 - has such a large user base there's a lot
18:13 - of documentation and examples for it
18:15 - albeit you know depending on what
18:17 - environment you're working with you know
18:18 - there's not necessarily as much for
18:20 - working with it in the browser
18:21 - but matter touch is one of the reasons I
18:24 - wanted to explore it is it has a really
18:25 - nice website with thorough documentation
18:27 - a lot of good examples if I come over
18:29 - here you can see so this is an example
18:31 - of box2d running and processing and one
18:33 - of the nice things about box2d it has it
18:35 - has a concept of a motor so you can see
18:38 - there's actually this the motor is on
18:40 - right now if I click the mouse you can
18:43 - see this this is a revolute joint it's
18:45 - actually a way of attaching to things
18:47 - based on like a singular point that one
18:50 - object can revolve around and so you can
18:53 - see almost like a wheel you can see
18:55 - without the motor this this kind of
18:58 - seesaw just responds to what's landing
19:00 - on it but if I turn the motor on its
19:02 - going to turn and actually active
19:04 - activate and start to hit these circles
19:07 - that are falling from the sky so to
19:09 - speak if I go to another use for this is
19:14 - an example of box2d which has something
19:16 - called a change shape which I'm using to
19:18 - create this surface and you can see here
19:21 - that I'm also using revolute joints
19:23 - five acres exist not but our revolute
19:27 - joints to have the wheels of this car
19:29 - turn and move along this surface so
19:32 - that's you can see some possibilities
19:34 - here with box2d and this is an example
19:39 - of using these are called distance
19:42 - joints which are like spring Levin boxes
19:44 - where all these circles are connected
19:46 - creating this like springy like bridge
19:48 - and if I click here I can add rectangles
19:52 - to the system and you can see they're
19:53 - kind of landing and getting caught on
19:55 - this particular bridge so these are the
19:56 - kinds of things that you can think about
19:58 - making in a system like box 2d now what
20:04 - else do I have to show you so in terms
20:06 - of thinking about toxic lives and
20:08 - connected systems this is actually toxic
20:11 - load simulation where it looks like oh
20:14 - I've got this like stringy rope based
20:16 - thing and I can kind of click on this
20:18 - and grab it and move it but really what
20:20 - this is if I were to go into the code
20:22 - just for a brief second and just change
20:28 - this to ellipse pxpy 8 comma 8 I'm going
20:33 - to draw a little circles there this is
20:37 - actually what this is actually what's
20:40 - going on so if i zoom in here you can
20:42 - see that what this actually is I'm not
20:44 - drawing the lines between them as these
20:46 - are just a lot of particles each
20:47 - connected by a spring so when you pull
20:49 - on monocles on the other but depending
20:52 - on how I render it I can make I can
20:53 - render it all of the continuous line
20:55 - which gives it kind of like a string
20:56 - like quality to it a string or rope like
20:59 - quality to it let's put this back and I
21:01 - can display a larger circle at the
21:03 - bottom and now you can sort of see now
21:05 - you can sort of see more what it look
21:07 - what it looks like here with this kind
21:08 - of view so this is toxic lives and I
21:11 - could open up another toxic lives
21:13 - example just to show you this idea of
21:16 - like the cloth simulation so you can see
21:19 - this is a lot of particles all connected
21:22 - by Springs but in a grid with some
21:24 - gravity pulling down and the two they're
21:26 - just locked in attached to the top and
21:29 - you can see it has a kind of cloth like
21:31 - quality to it
21:34 - and I think and then a batterer Dutch as
21:37 - so matter to here's the website for a
21:38 - matter judge ask and you can see what's
21:40 - really nice is just right and then on
21:41 - the home page it's showing you a lot of
21:43 - demos of the kinds of things you can do
21:45 - with with with matter judge is this is
21:50 - my favorite these little like car things
21:52 - actually that's my favorite I love this
21:53 - one I got built I got to build some of
21:55 - these was like a challenge or something
21:56 - okay so that's a bit of an overview
21:59 - about physics engine I'm doing this as a
22:02 - live stream right now you might be
22:03 - watching this as an archive video and so
22:05 - what I'm going to do is now take some
22:07 - questions from the chat to see what I
22:09 - missed and answer them
22:15 - you
