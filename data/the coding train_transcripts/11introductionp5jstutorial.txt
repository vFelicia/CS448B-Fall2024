00:02 - Hello! I'm making a video!
00:05 - You are watching a video, I think ...
00:08 - The goal of this video is to
talk about something called p5.js
00:16 - What is p5.js?
00:19 - Who should you or might
you be thinking about learning
00:23 - this thing called p5.js
from the very, very beginner stage
00:28 - without any experience with
anything else whatsoever
00:32 - and what might you use it for 
and what's going to happen?
00:36 - Am I making more videos? 
less videos? That sort of thing.
00:40 - So, first let me give you 
a little context.
00:44 - There is this thing called Processing.
00:49 - Processing is a project 
that started in 2001
00:53 - by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry
01:03 - The two of them were students together
at the MIT media lab -
01:06 - designers, artists, programmers -
trying to make a tool
01:12 - that could help them 
with their own work.
01:14 - Since then, since 2001, this idea of
'creative coding' - it's a complex term,
01:20 - but - 'creative applications
through programming'
01:22 - I like to think of it as 'creative 
expression through programming' -
01:25 - how do you communicate and 
express your ideas
01:27 - while making computational tools -
01:31 - It's also like - if you know how to
learn to program -
01:35 - There's a lot of like, "Learn to program! 
Learn to program! Everyone's gotta
01:37 - learn to program! Aah!" kind of stuff
going on these days -
01:39 - Take a deep breath, relax, you don't need
to know how to program.
01:44 - There's lots of great stuff 
in the world -
01:46 - you could learn how to play the violin, 
that's a wonderful thing,
01:49 - but there is an aspect of learning to
program that is very powerful in that
01:54 - that software is something that 
drives so much of what we use.
01:56 - And if you want to not be stuck
just, kind of using whatever software
02:01 - other people - large corporations -
02:04 - if you want to be able to express yourself
in new and different ways,
02:06 - learning to program is a great 
way to do that.
02:09 - Also, and this is gonna kind of 
come around full circle here,
02:13 - learning to program and have the results
of what you program go in a browser
02:19 - on the web, so that other people can
see those things -
02:23 - that you can share and distribute 
easily - this is a very powerful thing.
02:29 - So, interestingly enough, when Processing
was first created, it was built on top of
02:35 - a programming language called 'Java', 
which was all the rage back in 2001
02:40 - and one of the reasons why Processing
used Java is that
02:47 - you can make these things called applets
and applets would run in the web browser!
02:52 - So you could program your thing 
in Processing, upload it to the web,
02:55 - distribute it, all the world would see it,
you'd become rich and famous
02:59 - or, even better, you don't become 
rich and famous
03:01 - but you do something good for the world
- or both, perhaps!
03:05 - then, that made a lot of sense.
03:08 - Fast-forward 14 years later, 2015,
03:11 - when was the last time you saw 
a java applet on the web?
03:15 - If you saw it, it was just basically an 
experience with a giant error message
03:19 - that told that your browser crashed
and nothing worked.
03:21 - The language these days of the browser
is something called JavaScript.
03:27 - And I'll say a bit more about that 
in a minute
03:28 - JavaScript allows you to program and 
create all sorts of exciting things
03:33 - that happen in a web browser.
If you're interested in creating unique
03:36 - and animated and creative web content,
learning JavaScript, learning p5.js, is
03:43 - something you might be interested in.
03:44 - Now, [...] some time in the last couple
of years, a bunch of us were talking
03:57 - and we asked the question:
03:59 - "What language would you pick if 
Processing were being invented today?"
04:05 - And somebody that answered that question
in an interesting way,
04:11 - her name is Lauren McCarthy.
04:14 - So, Lauren McCarthy began a project, 
in collaboration with the Processing f...
04:20 - Processing is a not for profit foundation,
so I was about to say Processing foundation -
04:25 - [...ramble...]
04:32 - So Lauren said, "Ok, well, what if 
Processing was being invented today
04:37 - and the language, instead of Java, 
was JavaScript?"
04:43 - So this is what p5.js is, as a project.
04:46 - I should just briefly mention, there's 
another wonderful project
04:50 - called processing.js.
04:54 - I know this is crazily confusing, I just
want to briefly mention it.
04:57 - processing.js is a project started by
John Resig and many other people
05:01 - have worked on it since then.
05:02 - processing.js sort of tries to solve this
other problem:
05:07 - your java code can't run on the web 
as an applet anymore,
05:10 - what if we could behind-the-scenes
translate it to JavaScript
05:16 - so that it ran there?
05:17 - But this project, p5.js, is different 
in that it is a new project.
05:23 - We can now think wonderfully and
happily about
05:28 - that thing called Processing 
that I briefly spoke about,
05:30 - but mostly right now, 
for the purpose of these videos,
05:33 - we can now ignore this.
05:35 - p5.js is an environment, a simple -
hopefully simple -
05:41 - and beginner-friendly environment
05:43 - to help you learn JavaScript,
05:45 - to make applications, computational,
creative, interesting -
05:48 - hopefully interesting-
things happen in the browser.
05:52 - And eventually, you could go in a lot of
routes with this.
05:55 - You might make art, 
you might make data visualization,
05:57 - you might make websites, as like 
a web designer,
06:00 - there's lots of paths that you might take
06:03 - from this basic set of videos 
that I hope to make.
06:07 - I think that's just about the 
full context.
06:15 - There's some other pieces to
06:17 - "how do you make something happen
in the web browser",
06:19 - you need more than JavaScript, you need
these other things called
06:22 - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
06:25 - but I think what I wanna do now, 
very briefly,
06:26 - and I'm gonna pick this up in the
next video,
06:29 - is just look at, open p5.js and
do a few things with it,
06:32 - just so you get a sense of what kinds of
things it can do.
06:36 - What would be great is if I had a video
that showed you like
06:38 - "Here are a bunch of awesome projects
that are made with these kinds of tools."
06:42 - Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of 
really amazing JavaScript framework.
06:47 - So I think a missing piece here --
06:48 - Just like Processing was built 
on top of Java,
06:52 - it's a little bit different here
06:54 - p5.js is not really built on top of 
JavaScript, it is a set of...
07:00 - boy, this is a hard one ...
and I was doing so well! [...]
07:08 - What I think is useful to think of here
for a moment is p5.js is two things:
07:15 - One of these things is it's 
a library of functions.
07:18 - So, here's a great way 
of thinking about it.
07:20 - Let's say you want to learn JavaScript.
And you go to Google and you type,
07:23 - "JavaScipt" - boom.
Whoa! There's a lot of stuff out there.
07:27 - There's like a million Stack Overflow 
posts, which is like
07:31 - a place where people ask questions,
07:32 - there's 15 million "this.js" things
you could learn
07:35 - and there's something called jQuery
and there's so much.
07:38 - So, one of the goals, I think, of p5.js
is to give you a little bit of a sandbox,
07:43 - a walled garden, to learn 
some of the basics, and for that,
07:46 - you get a library of functions,
07:48 - to draw a circle, or draw a rectangle,
or set a color
07:50 - so you can just use some basic drawing
functions to learn some of these
07:53 - beginner steps of programming.
07:56 - The other thing it is, and I think I need 
to move over to the computer here,
08:08 - The other thing it is is this thing here
08:11 - Sam Lavigne has created something called
the p5.js editor
08:18 - What this means is an application, 
a program on your computer that
08:21 - you can launch and just start typing 
some code in and get your feet wet
08:26 - and start to experiment and learn a bit
about code, without having to worry about
08:30 - all of the larger pieces of things that 
you need in order to make something happen
08:35 - on a web page. We're gonna do it very
simply here.
08:37 - So let's look at that for a second.
So I'm going to launch this.
08:39 - By the way, I just downloaded it.
I haven't -- I've used it...
08:45 - but, I haven't on this computer. 
So, look:
08:50 - "p5 is an application downloaded from the
internet. Are you sure you want to open it?"
08:55 - So now's the time when you could say, 
"Eh, I'm just going to play the violin."
08:58 - Or, "I'm going to go play frisbee
- football - soccer."
09:04 - But I'm going to open it. 
[...]
09:09 - A newer version of p5 is available.
I don't want to download it right now -
09:12 - just hit ok. Oops, I do want to download
it right now. Ok.
09:17 - So this here ...
[getting things opened]
09:35 - this here is the 
p5.js editor.
09:40 - And if you look at it, it's already 
filled in a little bit of code for you.
09:45 - So you can start to see, "Ah, I have to 
learn to program, I have to learn
09:48 - some strange new language and syntax."
09:50 - function. draw. parentheses. 
curly bracket. curly bracket.
09:55 - These are some things that will come
to light if you're for the first time
10:00 - watching this video and looking 
at programming.
10:02 - So I'm gonna do a couple things here
real quick.
10:06 - One thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna type
in CreateCanvas and down here under draw
10:13 - I'm gonna type rectangle and I'm gonna
type some other numbers
10:19 - and I'm going to zoom back out 
and hit play.
10:25 - And we can see here,
10:27 - look what's happened.
10:32 - I wrote something that says, 
"createCanvas!"
10:36 - and what did that do? It made a canvas.
10:38 - That's the canvas.
10:40 - Then, down here, I wrote something that 
said rect, short for rectangle.
10:44 - What did it do? It made a rectangle.
10:47 - So these are the first pieces, the first
things, that I'm going to show you
10:51 - in the next video.
10:52 - What lines of code do you start to write,
and what do those lines of code do?
10:57 - With ps.js here, the first things we're gonna 
learn is how to, like, draw a picture.
11:02 - And, by the way, this canvas is actually a
little mini web browser that's opened.
11:07 - So as more and more videos come to pass,
we can peel back some of these layers
11:11 - and see how you might take this and
put it on the web somewhere,
11:14 - share it, allow people to interact 
with it, that sort of thing.
11:17 - So, this video's ok. B+.
11:20 - I think I'm going to keep it though
and upload it and
11:25 - someday there will be a better one...
probably never...
11:27 - This is the end. I'm gonna make another
video and then upload that too
11:33 - and you can watch many of them.
11:35 - And I'm keeping a list - maybe I'll try to
put a link in the description or something
11:38 - maybe a list of all the videos I'm going
to make.
11:40 - I'm gonna make a lot of intro ones and
then some project-based ones like
11:46 - how to take a Google Spreadsheet and 
visualize it as a graph in JavaScript and
11:50 - try to do that in a short 10 minutes.
11:53 - That's sort of my plan for this semester.
