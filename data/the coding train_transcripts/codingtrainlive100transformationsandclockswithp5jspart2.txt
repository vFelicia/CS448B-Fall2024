00:00 - hey I should be I should be back test
00:09 - tests I think I am back I have a little
00:13 - bit of an issue with this other camera
00:15 - you guys are gonna enjoy seeing this for
00:16 - a second let me see I think if I press
00:20 - this button that should go away there we
00:24 - go so I'm really having some serious
00:29 - technical problems which I thought I had
00:31 - resolved but I clearly need to do some
00:35 - work before next week and I wouldn't be
00:37 - surprised if this crashes again now so
00:38 - unfortunately when it crashes it seems
00:40 - to focus the crash crashing baguettes
00:44 - crashing so what I was trying to do and
00:46 - now I realized thank you to me I am
00:49 - swimming in the slack group is that I
00:54 - don't think that you can actually see
01:01 - the matrix implementation in with HTM
01:05 - line so I think what I might actually do
01:07 - for the purpose of this video for
01:09 - explanation purposes so let me open up
01:11 - processing because the processing works
01:16 - exactly the same way so the mate the
01:20 - main thing that I want to do is I want
01:21 - to discuss why it's called push and pop
01:24 - and the concept of a stack and a queue
01:27 - sort of but I also want to talk about
01:29 - why it's called a matrix so let me get
01:32 - something let me get something going in
01:38 - processing just really quickly to see if
01:39 - this will do what I want it to do
01:49 - and what I want to say is no loop and I
01:55 - want to say print matrix and I want to
01:58 - say translate 100 comma 0 and once they
02:02 - print matrix again and someone remind me
02:09 - what's the what's a good nice succinct
02:11 - way of explaining why for two dimensions
02:17 - you need three numbers that's weird why
02:22 - did it in three dimensions you need four
02:30 - numbers so this is the default
02:33 - there should be two rows of this that
02:37 - doesn't seem right
02:40 - print matrix processing org um let me
02:46 - see print matrix well I don't have
02:48 - anyone just joined by accident I
02:50 - apologize I had a live stream going for
02:52 - like almost two hours that froze and
02:55 - crashed so I just like jumping right
02:56 - here in the middle because this should
02:58 - do all right I mean if I change this to
03:03 - P 2d it will give me what I'm expecting
03:12 - that's weird
03:21 - that doesn't seem right to me I should
03:25 - get this
03:34 - right okay so maybe I have to give up on
03:37 - this whole print matrix thing cuz I
03:40 - don't know why this isn't working now to
03:42 - give me an actual proper printout of
03:47 - what them because it's I've done this
03:49 - before in teaching where you kind of
03:52 - look at the default
04:00 - you
04:06 - hello so when this seems to happen what
04:15 - seems to help is I have to reap so this
04:20 - shouldn't I have to I'm I will not be
04:22 - streaming next week without different
04:23 - software or some major change because I
04:26 - thought it was a fluke last week but
04:28 - clearly that's not the case and
04:31 - hopefully you can see me now and hear me
04:35 - when I just check here yeah I don't see
04:43 - myself in my preview but as it working
04:45 - now no yes okay so what seems to be
04:56 - going on is I've bought right now trying
04:58 - to stream in 720p with some like idea
05:00 - that that might help instead of 1080p
05:02 - and what seems to happen is that I want
05:08 - to use open broadcast studio and I
05:09 - wasn't able to get that to work but I
05:11 - think I'm gonna have to just allocate
05:12 - some time the next week to trying to use
05:13 - that instead or maybe wiping the
05:15 - computer and reinstalling and resetting
05:17 - this setup up but if you if your bear
05:20 - with me for a second I'm gonna configure
05:21 - this is just the raw view now if the
05:24 - green screen I'm gonna I want to just
05:27 - come back as soon as I can I'm going to
05:29 - add the laptop and move that down and
05:39 - I'm going to and a chroma keying and
05:44 - then shrink myself a little bit and go
05:48 - over here to the corner and so I think
05:55 - you should see me now in my usual I
05:57 - think I might be smaller I think I might
06:02 - be smaller yeah I'm surgery on the elbow
06:05 - might have called all that caused all
06:07 - this
06:08 - alright I'm sorry I'm getting a little
06:10 - I'm sad that this is happening or
06:14 - trying to make this bigger alright so I
06:20 - am back up and running I kind of feel
06:22 - like when I'm not recording to disk I
06:25 - wonder if I can get away without
06:27 - recording to disk I'm gonna record to
06:30 - disk though I don't think that's the
06:32 - problem it's weird
06:42 - alright I'm according to disk now also
06:45 - alright so apologies for that I would
06:47 - just weep and so like I have to do this
06:49 - so often now I've gotten pretty good at
06:50 - I just like rebuilt the entire like
06:52 - Wirecast configuration really quickly
06:58 - maybe matrices maybe just only it's
07:01 - maybe it's matrices which are the
07:02 - problem because you know when you do
07:04 - machine learning you've got to work with
07:06 - matrices now I'm trying to do
07:07 - transformations and work with matrices I
07:09 - even get to custom shapes a clock coding
07:11 - challenge it's almost 6 o'clock a max
07:15 - might be the problem
07:18 - ok so let me see if I can keep going
07:20 - here I'm gonna give up on what I was
07:24 - going to attempt to show you because
07:26 - maybe just try this real quick yeah I
07:35 - don't know why this is not this print
07:38 - matrix function that I used to use
07:40 - doesn't work I'm gonna give up on
07:42 - showing that to you and I'm just going
07:44 - to explain that the values for
07:51 - describing how things are in a matrix
07:54 - okay look at this anybody wants to do
08:05 - something for p5 you could contribute an
08:09 - example this this webpage is a very few
08:11 - pieces of reference that don't have
08:13 - examples left to contribute there's some
08:15 - information on the p5 wiki here's one it
08:18 - may be implementing print matrix I don't
08:20 - know so I would love to look into that
08:22 - because I don't know that you need it so
08:24 - much but it is quite
08:26 - at apply matrix real quick it's useful
08:29 - for teaching so I could come back if we
08:32 - could get that implemented in p5 that
08:34 - would be an interesting thing to try to
08:35 - do apply there we go yes so this also
08:43 - [Music]
08:45 - this also is not really
08:48 - there's no example so I'm gonna I'm
08:50 - gonna I'm gonna fumble my way through
08:52 - this
08:54 - I'm gonna quit processing and this will
08:57 - be just one more follow up video about
08:59 - transformations which is really just
09:02 - gonna make use of the whiteboard because
09:03 - I don't know what else to say oh I
09:06 - didn't make the whiteboard shot give you
09:07 - a second here so I got to make the
09:11 - whiteboard shot capture device is three
09:15 - no that's the laptop capture device is
09:18 - two that's the green screen
09:38 - you
09:42 - and the laptop just completely
09:45 - disappeared hold on
09:58 - you guys can you guys see all this
10:00 - craziness that's going on I don't know
10:03 - if you can like I don't know if it's
10:04 - like live updating all the nonsense that
10:06 - I'm trying to do I'm back and god what a
10:17 - mess
10:21 - there we go P 30 there we go
10:28 - save
10:38 - hello in here okay uh all right oh I
10:50 - don't get to all the things I wanted to
10:51 - get to today this is terrible when can I
10:57 - come back alright so maybe I should just
11:01 - do the let me finish let me do this let
11:03 - me do this it's 5:45 I think I can
11:06 - manage to stay here until 6:00 and let's
11:09 - see what I can get done here and oh and
11:13 - I didn't hold on I have to do one more
11:15 - thing
11:16 - keyboard shortcut for this to work to
11:19 - keyboard shortcut for this to work one
11:23 - save two and alright so this is the
11:31 - third video about transformations this
11:33 - is the one that I was saying maybe you
11:34 - should skip but I just wanted to talk
11:36 - about a couple things in this video
11:37 - which are background about how these
11:38 - things work they're not really necessary
11:40 - for using them but I you know somebody
11:43 - said somebody told me they were
11:44 - interested in this at one point so push
11:46 - and pop so one thing you might ask
11:48 - yourself is what happens when I call
11:51 - push multiple times and pop multiple
11:54 - times well and this is actually
11:57 - something you often want to do if you
11:59 - want to have all these sort of nested
12:00 - systems and and and it relates to why
12:02 - these are called push and pop oh and
12:04 - something else about pushing pop let's
12:06 - start this video over all right it's
12:14 - there's no audio on the whiteboard scene
12:16 - is that still the issue or that was an
12:19 - old message there's no audio sworkit on
12:21 - the whiteboard scene I think you
12:22 - probably told me that wasn't before but
12:24 - now it's okay it's fine now okay
12:34 - all right so I'm gonna make one more
12:36 - video here about transformations just to
12:39 - like cover a few bases that I didn't get
12:41 - to and some of this is unnecessary
12:42 - information you could probably get this
12:43 - one but if you want to dive a little bit
12:45 - deeper into this there's there's there's
12:47 - a few things about this the first thing
12:48 - I want to say that's actually quite
12:49 - crucial about push and pop is that push
12:52 - and pop doesn't just save and restore
12:54 - transformation information and this is
12:56 - actually not true if you're using
12:58 - processing the Java based platform that
13:00 - I use in some of my videos this is only
13:02 - true if using p5.js because it's the way
13:04 - that the html5 canvas works you're using
13:07 - all these terms that I know that I don't
13:09 - want to use but I'm using them so it
13:11 - actually saves and restores lots of
13:13 - style information as well which can be
13:15 - useful to you so for example if I go
13:17 - back to this code and at the at the end
13:20 - here if I just want to draw another
13:22 - ellipse like the other ellipse is gonna
13:24 - be at 300 is gonna be at 300 360 60 and
13:30 - I hit refresh now look at this this
13:32 - ellipse is not gray with a white stroke
13:36 - with a white outline it should be
13:38 - because I said stroke 255 fill 100 drew
13:43 - the rectangle but actually push and pop
13:46 - also save and restore stroke weight
13:51 - stroke fill all sorts of styling things
13:54 - now if I could try to give you a list of
13:56 - every single function that's everything
13:58 - will setting that's saved and restored
13:59 - by pushing pop and I wouldn't know I
14:01 - would be able to begin but but in
14:02 - addition to the transformation stuff you
14:04 - can also use this for styling
14:06 - information which I generally don't but
14:08 - you might find this useful in another
14:09 - context so that's it that's number one
14:11 - now the other thing that I want to
14:12 - mention is that you could imagine a more
14:15 - complex scene where you know this thing
14:20 - is rotating around this thing and this
14:22 - other thing is rotating around this
14:24 - thing but there's other thing is
14:24 - rotating this thing but not this thing
14:26 - and you start needing to say push draw
14:28 - some stuff push draw some stuff push
14:31 - draw some stuff pop draw some stuff pop
14:33 - pop or something like that right so one
14:36 - thing you should realize is you could
14:37 - only have as many pops as you have push
14:39 - you could only restore the amount of
14:42 - things you've saved but there the
14:44 - question arise is
14:46 - which is when I save a bunch of times
14:49 - and I restore which thing that I save do
14:51 - I restore and a way that you can
14:54 - determine the answer of this question is
14:56 - is the way that I'm saving the sequence
14:59 - in something called a stack or a queue
15:02 - or perhaps some other algorithm so
15:05 - there's something called a stack and
15:08 - there's something called a queue now if
15:12 - I spelled that wrong a queue what are
15:14 - these things so push and pop are terms
15:17 - that apply to saving and restoring
15:20 - information in a stack it's called a
15:24 - stack because you can think of it like a
15:25 - stack of paper so if this is like a bin
15:28 - your inbox so to speak and I put paper a
15:31 - in there then paper B then paper C then
15:33 - paper D they're stacking up a b c d so
15:38 - push is pushing the things onto the
15:40 - stack adding to the top of the stack
15:42 - when i say pop i take the last thing out
15:45 - so first one in last one out the last
15:49 - one in first one out that's what it is
15:51 - the stack the last thing i put at the
15:53 - top of the pile of paper is the first
15:54 - one i'm gonna take off this is different
15:56 - than a queue which you could think of
15:58 - like you know some kind of like ticket
16:00 - window right where people line up in a
16:04 - queue the first person in line for the
16:08 - queue is the first person to get a
16:10 - ticket so these are data structures that
16:12 - are that are common to a lot of programs
16:15 - and a lot of scenarios that if you watch
16:16 - all of my videos might come up with lots
16:18 - of other places you don't really need to
16:20 - worry about this too much in the case of
16:22 - transformations but it is important to
16:23 - realize that push and pop are terms that
16:26 - relate to the data structure a stack
16:28 - they were sort of pushing things onto
16:30 - the stack popping things off of the
16:32 - stack and if you push multiple times
16:34 - save multiple times you're restoring in
16:36 - reverse order so I should cook up some
16:40 - kind of example I can't think of come
16:43 - back and do that another time but that's
16:45 - one thing I want to say now the other
16:46 - thing I want to say about
16:48 - transformations if I come back is let me
16:54 - go to the p5 jazz jazz reference and let
16:59 - me search
17:00 - transformation transform you're gonna
17:02 - see so first of all that you're gonna
17:04 - see there's a couple other things oh did
17:07 - you shake it just oh shoot I got to do
17:09 - that again because I didn't switch the
17:10 - camera hi everybody
17:14 - let me come back there's one more thing
17:16 - I want to show I mean with a p5
17:19 - reference here I'm gonna go to transform
17:20 - and I'm gonna look at all these
17:22 - functions so there's a couple things
17:23 - there there's some things that are
17:24 - important here number one is oh my
17:25 - goodness in addition to rotate there's
17:28 - rotate X and rotate Y rotate Z now those
17:31 - functions rotate XY and Z actually no
17:33 - idea what she Rex in here why do we we
17:36 - should look at look at the reference to
17:37 - read that those functions are for the
17:40 - WebGL renderer the WebGL render is a 3d
17:43 - render for p5 you know at the recording
17:46 - of this video it's still in the very
17:48 - early stages there was a lot of work
17:49 - that was done over this past summer
17:51 - through a program called Google Summer
17:52 - of Code so it's the WebGL library is in
17:55 - much better shape and hopefully will
17:56 - continue to improve it's a way of doing
17:58 - 3d and p5 I should come back and make it
18:00 - on the video about that and look at
18:01 - transformations in 3d so but you know in
18:05 - case you're wondering if you're you know
18:06 - rotate is the same as rotate Z the z
18:09 - axis is the axis that comes out of the
18:12 - screen and so things rotate around the z
18:14 - axis if I come back to this write this
18:17 - over here I think I'm like desperate to
18:23 - do this like exact demonstration that I
18:24 - want to do this is good that's the z
18:31 - axis this is pathetic
18:33 - that's the z axis I'm pointing at you so
18:37 - that's something rotating around the z
18:38 - axis if it was rotating around the y
18:40 - axis it would come out of the screen
18:42 - like this it was rotating around the
18:44 - x-axis would come out of the screen like
18:46 - this but not actually come out of the
18:47 - screen because it's 2d and I've off it
18:49 - never-never-land talking about 3d but
18:51 - it's really it's just the illusion
18:52 - explore that on your own time or I will
18:54 - come back to in a future video but the
18:56 - other thing I wanted to mention here is
18:57 - you'll see like o apply matrix reset
19:01 - matrix why is the word matrix there what
19:03 - are we talking about well it turns out
19:06 - that the way the orientation the
19:10 - transformation state what does the
19:12 - transformation stay
19:13 - zero-zero in the top-left is there any
19:16 - rotation is there any scaling is stored
19:19 - in a matrix of numbers and that matrix
19:21 - and numbers might look something like
19:22 - this 1 0 0 0 1 0 so this is a 2x3 matrix
19:29 - 2 rows 3 columns and this is describing
19:33 - the sort of default matrix with no
19:36 - rotation no translation no scaling you
19:39 - can imagine if I scale by 2 this matrix
19:42 - might turn into 2 2 if I translate some
19:45 - of these numbers might change if I
19:47 - rotate some of these numbers might
19:48 - change so I would love to do some kind
19:51 - of tutorials pretend that I know all
19:52 - about this and we can do something like
19:54 - tutorial series about you know
19:56 - programming your own transformation
19:57 - engine 3d rendering thing and like how
20:00 - you calculate all these matrices but
20:01 - this is what's more important about it
20:03 - is that as you do this it's it's all
20:07 - stored in a matrix so some things you
20:09 - can do is you can just actually call the
20:12 - reset matrix function and reset is like
20:14 - just wipe everything so push push push
20:17 - pop pop pop is like save save save
20:19 - restore restore but if you just want to
20:21 - reset back to the default state you can
20:22 - just call reset matrix apply matrix I've
20:25 - never actually used this and I don't
20:27 - know how far along if this actually
20:28 - works maybe five but but in theory if it
20:31 - does what it's supposed to do is I could
20:32 - cook up my own set of numbers put that
20:37 - into some kind of array or something and
20:38 - then apply that to the matrix hi this
20:42 - video better go far away buried deep
20:44 - somewhere in the playlist because this
20:46 - really isn't part of the first few weeks
20:47 - of learning to program but I'll figure
20:49 - that out later boys
20:50 - so that's really the last pieces that I
20:52 - want to explain what is push and pop and
20:54 - what is why why do we talk about a
20:58 - matrix when we talk about
20:59 - transformations okay thanks all right oh
21:05 - it's just three by two matrix
21:07 - but isn't it two by three don't you say
21:11 - the when you talk about matrices in
21:13 - linear algebra don't you say the number
21:16 - of rows first than the number of columns
21:18 - next so that's a mistake in the p5 page
21:21 - right
21:24 - so or did I get it wrong somebody will
21:28 - tell me somebody will help me alright so
21:31 - here's the thing we don't have very much
21:34 - time left I would like to do something a
21:38 - bit more exciting and interesting for
21:41 - this 100th livestream plus I said I
21:45 - would read 100 random numbers which I
21:47 - will do
21:48 - somebody's gonna who by the way whenever
21:51 - you do 100 random numbers somebody's
21:52 - gonna have to stop okay so I said it
21:59 - correctly that's great I think I should
22:02 - do that I think I should probably do
22:06 - that yeah I should this is great me I am
22:12 - so me is referencing canvas rendering
22:16 - context 2d transform so p5 by the way
22:22 - the way that it is just wrapping all of
22:25 - these functions that are built into that
22:28 - are built into the browser itself and so
22:34 - I guess it's using this so we could
22:37 - learn more by looking at this but I
22:41 - don't I don't want to do that right now
22:42 - okay all right let's try doing a let's
22:46 - do a this stream let's do the clock I
22:49 - think I should do the clock coding
22:51 - challenge rather than try to make a
22:53 - video tutorial about custom shapes with
22:55 - vertices and I'll just come back to that
22:57 - next week I mean I could do the straw
22:59 - poll thing but I sort of feel confident
23:00 - that that's it's good to have each week
23:03 - have a coding challenge don't you think
23:05 - and I'm gonna do a really simple clock
23:08 - so let me pull up some I need to pull up
23:11 - some URLs real quick so let me pull up
23:18 - these URLs so I want to look at the 12 I
23:21 - want to find the 12 o'clock series John
23:25 - Maeda interesting this
23:32 - oh actually this is the page that I want
23:36 - to look for yeah I think goal on Levin
23:44 - who teaches at Carnegie Mellon we made a
23:50 - bunch of these with p5.js I thought he
23:53 - said that to me but that would be a
23:56 - wonderful project if he didn't for us to
23:58 - do as a community
24:02 - let me look okay let me look at this
24:05 - page new media clocks and clock
24:14 - assignment anybody wants to like follow
24:19 - along with me see if you could find
24:20 - anything online that says that goal on
24:22 - Levin with the club so look at this this
24:25 - is great this is kind of like this is
24:27 - great this is kind of like what I want
24:28 - to do oh and he's doing it with K so
24:32 - this is such a nice fun assignment so
24:38 - we're gonna do this assignment which is
24:41 - due oh my god just do today perfect this
24:48 - is great this is great so I'm gonna
24:51 - mention this and I mention my does don't
24:55 - let me just look at my Twitter messages
24:57 - did I imagine that I recently got his
25:05 - clocks working again and documented them
25:06 - on my course website so I don't know if
25:09 - that means working again in p5 or just
25:11 - running in but I would be great to port
25:13 - all these to p5 Golan are you on Twitter
25:17 - right now kind of to tone tweet of and
25:18 - asking whether they actually are ported
25:21 - to p5 or not or when he says he got them
25:24 - working I'm gonna do direct message him
25:25 - now
25:30 - nobody tweets you know I'm sweet I go
25:32 - get it working by running on and bold OS
25:37 - alright okay so I wish I knew the answer
25:42 - to this question because but I will if
25:46 - maybe he'll get back to me or I will
25:48 - simply so let's do this clock coding
25:51 - challenge so I was thinking of doing it
25:53 - with arcs I want to do something simple
25:56 - I mean arc is a kind of nice thing but
25:57 - maybe I should actually just do the do
26:01 - like a simple template like this like
26:08 - this is a nice of what I do what I want
26:10 - to do is I want to make a clock that's
26:13 - really simple like this I guess this one
26:15 - R exists so I'm not going to recreate
26:17 - this without like a really strong design
26:20 - point of view I want to show alkis
26:21 - clocks also let me get that that's a
26:25 - great example what is let me let me find
26:32 - Alka can you or somebody just post in
26:34 - the patron group slack channel the link
26:37 - to the alkalis have to scroll back and
26:40 - find it in slack which is a little hard
26:41 - for me to do what live Alka code I'm
26:43 - going to look and see maybe if these are
26:48 - some really nice examples from Alka
26:51 - collections I'm going to be able to find
26:52 - it collections clocks there we go okay
26:58 - so I'm also going to reference this
27:00 - these are wonderful
27:02 - so something like this would be a great
27:05 - thing for me to do like just this like
27:07 - floating Bart clock so sorry alright so
27:12 - let me look at the chance up what's the
27:16 - chance that go on messaged me back no
27:19 - not yet all right okay all right so here
27:30 - we go I am going to check my phone which
27:33 - is always the greatest thing to do while
27:35 - I'm live-streaming
27:38 - make sure there's no emergencies that
27:40 - because I'm Way behind as always
27:42 - oh the camera went off that's good
27:45 - timing and this is gonna be the last
27:50 - thing that I'm going to do which is the
27:52 - clock
27:53 - Cody time I think I'm gonna do it with
27:54 - arcs because arcs is kind of interesting
27:56 - and then I can explore arcs also in this
27:58 - video if I switch to the whiteboard you
28:04 - don't hear the music right yeah I need
28:07 - to erase the whiteboard I could fix that
28:10 - but because I've got to need the
28:15 - whiteboard so okay I can hear the music
28:19 - but you can't first the camera went off
28:45 - for the 100th livestream maybe it would
28:49 - be nice to create a page with 100 clocks
28:55 - or something like that
28:57 - this is B trying to make this into
28:59 - something more special besides the usual
29:01 - like everything keeps crashing and not
29:02 - working and I'm Way behind and I get
29:04 - tired and hungry and wiped out and all
29:07 - sorts of stuff like that okay it's the
29:15 - only reason why you're hearing it lower
29:17 - over here is because it's coming in
29:18 - through the my mic because I can hear it
29:23 - okay so I'm gonna assume no I'm gonna
29:28 - assume that when he got them working to
29:32 - make these gifts that he just ran it on
29:35 - an old computer and be interesting to
29:37 - try to port some of these two three five
29:38 - and we could do that as a project all
29:43 - right all right everybody here we go
29:49 - tick tock tick tock goes the clock
29:52 - anyway this is a coding challenge where
29:55 - I am going to make a very simple very
29:57 - basic clock in p5 GS why am I doing this
30:00 - well if you are beginning to learn about
30:02 - programming and learn about graphics and
30:04 - animation a great exercise that you can
30:06 - do that can really can really express
30:08 - your creativity with is invent a new way
30:10 - of showing time make make a clock and
30:15 - whatever imaginative crazy way has never
30:17 - been done before
30:19 - and it's really easy to get the time
30:21 - information with p5.js and then it's
30:23 - just up to you to figure out what to
30:25 - draw based on that time information now
30:26 - the inspiration for this idea comes from
30:29 - also very loud squeak John Midas twelve
30:33 - o'clock so John Maeda this is a project
30:36 - from 1996 to 97 made in classic Mac for
30:42 - classic Mac you could see here
30:44 - are examples of John Maeda 12 clocks and
30:50 - these were this this documentation page
30:53 - was created by Golan Levin who as for
30:57 - his course at Carnegie Mellon University
30:59 - oh that's from last year maybe has an
31:05 - assignment which is to create your own
31:07 - clock and so here's an example clock
31:10 - made in p5.js a template and you can see
31:12 - this is what I'm talking like to do
31:14 - something like this which just shows you
31:16 - the mechanics of how you get the hour
31:18 - the minute the second and draw something
31:19 - based on those and template that you
31:23 - could use and I hope that making this
31:25 - video will inspire a world of so many
31:28 - clocks that I could never possibly
31:30 - imagine and I can't wait to see all the
31:31 - clocks that people are going to make
31:32 - after watching this video and I will try
31:34 - to come back and make more oh I want
31:35 - show you if you're looking for more
31:36 - inspiration I gotta get to making the
31:38 - clock this is a collection of clocks
31:40 - made by Alka loyal viewer of the coding
31:43 - train and there's some wonderful ones
31:45 - this is one of my this is a really nice
31:46 - one the particle clock will just look at
31:48 - this where we can see like a look at
31:50 - this these are particles so this is
31:51 - actually having particles fly around and
31:54 - end up and use it with the actual
31:56 - numbers of the time I'm gonna try to
31:57 - draw something based on time so okay so
32:02 - time out I need an edit point here
32:05 - because I just realized I need to like
32:09 - create the code project so hold on a sec
32:15 - this is a little edit point in the video
32:18 - I'm gonna say clock and I'm going to go
32:28 - back to the browser clock and I'm going
32:34 - to take out everything
32:47 - so for this Oh I'm editing the wrong
32:54 - file aren't I let me do this
33:12 - okay that's good checking my Twitter
33:17 - messages let me just ask what asking
33:28 - asking because I was going to give
33:32 - porting all the clocks as a challenge to
33:36 - yours okay so some loyal viewers I say
33:41 - some oil viewer - did I like describe
33:44 - Alka in a weird awkward way that I
33:47 - should redo that video hopefully it's
33:48 - okay alright
34:05 - I now have some empty code and I am
34:09 - ready to start programming the clock so
34:11 - there's two things I want to talk about
34:12 - before I start writing some code number
34:15 - one is how do I get the time information
34:16 - so this is actually one of the things
34:18 - the p5 does for you I mean it's just
34:20 - wrapping native JavaScript file on
34:22 - functions that are part of the browser
34:23 - for getting the current time based on
34:25 - your computer's clock and if I go to the
34:29 - p5 reference we can see those under time
34:31 - and date so I can get the day the hour
34:34 - the minute the month the second and the
34:36 - year I'm just gonna use our minute I'm
34:40 - just going to use and second okay no
34:42 - three hour minute and second Millie's is
34:45 - a different is something different
34:48 - Millie's go away phone Millie's is a
34:57 - function that gives you the number of
34:59 - milliseconds that have passed since the
35:01 - sketch started and this could be used
35:03 - for timers and keeping track of things
35:04 - and thinking an animation to a clock and
35:07 - it's interesting and useful but I'm
35:08 - gonna actually just pull and I'm not
35:10 - gonna do like you know fracture those of
35:12 - a second I'm just gonna pull hour minute
35:15 - and second from from p5 so let's
35:17 - actually really quickly just like spin
35:20 - up a digital clock so I'm gonna say let
35:23 - our equal hours let minute equal minutes
35:29 - I think this is right let second equal
35:33 - seconds for those the name of the
35:36 - functions hour minute second boy this is
35:39 - so this is a terrible idea that I just
35:40 - did hour minute second I'm gonna call
35:44 - this HR for owl and n for minute and SC
35:48 - for second I really should come up with
35:50 - better variable names than that that's
35:51 - what I'm gonna do right now and what I'm
35:53 - going to do next is I'm just gonna say
35:55 - fill 255 no stroke and then I'm gonna
35:59 - say text hour + : + minute + : + seconds
36:13 - and I'm gonna put that at 10 comma 200
36:15 - so let's see if this works we have a
36:17 - really quickly
36:19 - there we go we have our clock right it
36:22 - is now six oh eight and twenty eight
36:28 - twenty nine thirty seconds is that the
36:30 - right time oh my god so that's why I'm
36:33 - gonna keep going with this kind of jobs
36:34 - and I'll leave when I'm done this is
36:37 - good actually to do it when I'm supposed
36:38 - to be somewhere that I have the coding
36:40 - challenges to me at the time so there's
36:42 - no zero there so I need to think about
36:44 - number formatting and you know there's
36:47 - all sorts of interesting things I could
36:48 - do for designing making a digital clock
36:50 - I'm leaving all the creative ideas to
36:52 - you but what I want to do is visualize
36:53 - the time so I think my idea to do
36:56 - something rather simple but it's a
36:57 - little bit more interesting than just
36:59 - bars is I'm going to use arcs so this is
37:03 - what the ellipse function does in p5 the
37:06 - ellipse function draws an ellipse or a
37:08 - circle at a given X Y according to some
37:11 - width and according to some height and
37:13 - the width and height could be the same
37:15 - because you get to give that just as a
37:16 - diameter if it's a perfect circle so I'm
37:18 - actually just going to have an ellipse
37:19 - and an XY with a particular diameter
37:22 - okay what the arc function does is
37:27 - exactly the same thing it draws an
37:30 - ellipse at a given X Y with a given
37:33 - diameter however in addition to the X Y
37:38 - the diameter width and height I can give
37:42 - a start angle and an end angle meaning I
37:45 - can say draw this arc from 0 to 180
37:50 - degrees so I'll only see this part of
37:54 - the of the circle so let's see how that
37:56 - works come back over here and come back
38:06 - over here and this is not the code okay
38:10 - let me try that again come back over
38:15 - here and let's try to draw just to see
38:19 - this in action I'm gonna get rid of the
38:22 - text now I don't need that anymore I can
38:23 - use that for debugging I'm gonna draw an
38:25 - ellipse at 200 200 I'm gonna say stroke
38:30 - wait for no
38:32 - Phil and I'm going to give it a diameter
38:36 - of let's just say 200 right now let's
38:40 - yeah no let's say 300 and let's take a
38:44 - look at that oh and I need to say stroke
38:48 - 255 so there's my ellipse right that's
38:52 - the full lips now what I want to do is I
38:55 - want to draw an arc so I'm gonna say
38:57 - stroke and I'm gonna give it some
39:01 - arbitrary color and I'm gonna say arc
39:04 - and I'm gonna give it exactly these same
39:07 - values and I'm going to say 0 to 360 0
39:15 - to 360 which means draw the whole thing
39:17 - the full circle from 0 all the way 3 or
39:20 - 6 degrees the problem is I want to think
39:22 - of degrees here I've talked in other
39:23 - videos about degrees versus radians a
39:26 - different unit of measurements it's an
39:27 - interesting topic but it's easier for me
39:29 - right now I think to just say angle mode
39:31 - degrees so that the unit of measurement
39:33 - that I'm using in the arc function is
39:35 - degrees and if I run this we see this
39:38 - whoops this circle what just happened
39:40 - there the circle I don't want to be
39:42 - there sorry everybody we see the circle
39:46 - turned pink but it didn't actually turn
39:48 - pink right if I make the stroke weight
39:51 - of this eight whoops oh and the stroke
39:57 - weight of this one for we can see the
40:03 - pink arc inside of the white one and I
40:06 - could say with the arc like let me only
40:08 - have 180 degrees half of that and you
40:10 - can see that it's drawing that inside
40:13 - though that's drawing that inside only
40:15 - 180 degrees and what I could do is I
40:18 - could say let end equal to map the mouse
40:22 - X location which goes between 0 and
40:23 - width between 0 and 360 degrees and I
40:27 - could say end here so you can see as I
40:31 - move the mouse and this is a little I'm
40:33 - gonna I want to do this the and kind of
40:36 - like the other way around actually I
40:38 - know this is a little bit weird
40:43 - this makes no sense what I'm doing I'm
40:45 - gonna get rid of that one right you can
40:49 - see this is me drawing that full arc so
40:52 - going from zero all the way to 360
40:55 - degrees
40:55 - and by the way there are varying ways I
40:57 - can fill in the arc like I'm at this
41:00 - point I probably just want to say no
41:02 - fill and it's just gonna do this but if
41:06 - I wanted to keep that fill there I can
41:08 - actually add a final argument I can say
41:10 - PI which is exactly this I'm feeling
41:14 - like it's a pie chart I can say open
41:18 - which actuate photo-ops I'm in the wrong
41:22 - function sorry everybody
41:27 - Matt you're gonna have to edit this I
41:30 - could say PI which is like filling it
41:35 - like a pie chart right you can see that
41:38 - I can say open which is filling it like
41:42 - this not as a pipe it straight across
41:44 - without connecting the stroke or I can
41:46 - actually say cord which is filling it
41:49 - like open but by connecting the stroke
41:52 - so that's a small detail but it's
41:53 - interesting to see how that works with
41:54 - arc kind of useful I don't care about
41:56 - any of that because I want to say no
41:58 - film so what I want to do now is instead
42:03 - of instead of just mapping this arcs
42:07 - location to the mouse I want to say map
42:11 - the number of seconds which goes between
42:15 - 0 and 60 to between 0 and 360 and look
42:19 - at that there's my clock with the number
42:21 - of seconds now I want to let me do the
42:27 - same thing again and one and two and I
42:32 - could be more thoughtful about this let
42:34 - me map the number of minutes that also
42:37 - goes between 0 and 360 but I'm gonna
42:40 - have it be you know 280 so a little
42:45 - smaller and n2 so there's the number of
42:50 - minutes right and as soon as seconds
42:54 - gets all the way to 60 this should go
42:56 - one more
42:57 - come on get to sixty here we go there we
42:59 - go minutes went up by one and now I'm
43:03 - gonna do the very last one and three
43:08 - between four hour an hour goes from zero
43:14 - to 24 and I could give some different
43:18 - colors here too also you know again I'm
43:20 - not being very thoughtful about the
43:22 - design that's what I'm hoping you who
43:27 - are watching this video were much more
43:28 - creative than me but I can now see and I
43:32 - actually want this one to be instead of
43:34 - 280 let's say 260 and now we can see I
43:39 - have the number of seconds the number of
43:44 - minutes and then the hour but this isn't
43:47 - right right because what do you what if
43:49 - I want these to actually point to where
43:52 - the V you know what's right what's wrong
43:55 - the point is to make a kind of creative
43:56 - clock that you wouldn't normally imagine
43:59 - seeing but what I what I would like to
44:04 - do here however is actually have these
44:07 - position in the correct place in the
44:09 - sense of like if it were 3 o'clock the
44:11 - ark would go from the top all the way to
44:13 - there so let's think about the time the
44:15 - time that I'm recording this right now
44:16 - is approximately 6:15 p.m. so the hours
44:20 - should go all the way to the bottom and
44:24 - so the hours 6 o'clock oh no but it's
44:29 - 24-hour clock oh it's a 24-hour clock
44:32 - let me just do that in a second and I'll
44:35 - think about no I can do it I could do it
44:36 - let's do it let's do it so one thing I
44:38 - could do is say actually the hours don't
44:40 - go between 0 & 24 they go between 0 and
44:42 - 12 and I just say modulus 12th so it'll
44:49 - restart once it gets to 12 and 13 will
44:52 - become 1 o'clock again so that we can
44:54 - see now this is being the hours but it's
44:56 - off what I really want to do is have
44:58 - that range not go from 0 to 360 but I
45:01 - want to start at negative 90 degrees
45:04 - right so this is confusing because
45:06 - rotation happens counterclockwise so if
45:10 - this is 0
45:10 - agrees I want to start up here at
45:12 - negative 90 or I could also think of
45:15 - that as 270 right and I want to go from
45:19 - that all the way to itself do this this
45:30 - is an interesting problem because
45:31 - because I want it to go this will work
45:34 - right actually timeout somebody help me
45:39 - with this I me I am so Mia is just
45:45 - saying rotate that's a very interesting
45:49 - suggestion should be 0 to 59 thank you
45:56 - thank you thank you ok hmm what so me I
46:03 - am so me in the chat just said well why
46:05 - don't instead I could just rotate
46:06 - everything something interesting
46:07 - actually about in p5 is 0 degrees when
46:11 - you when you put the end at zero it
46:12 - actually will draw you the entire thing
46:14 - and it's sort of debatable whether
46:15 - that's a good or bad idea but mostly it
46:17 - confuses people if it doesn't do that so
46:19 - that's why it does that in p5 but let's
46:20 - come back here so there's a couple
46:22 - things I can do number one is I could
46:24 - just translate to the center so I could
46:28 - use it I have a whole video now about
46:29 - transformations that you could watch so
46:31 - I could just translate to 200 200 and I
46:34 - could draw all these at 0-0 so this I
46:39 - think will be a nice or easier way to
46:40 - deal with this and I can then just say
46:43 - rotate I think negative 90 so there we
46:51 - go
46:52 - so now we can see I'm coming up on
46:54 - finishing 60 seconds and here we go and
47:00 - it starts over again now but I and you
47:02 - can see so now it is sit thought that's
47:05 - not six the green should be at six oh
47:08 - you know why so somebody else Maxwell
47:12 - and the chat is telling me 0 to 59 so
47:14 - this is a problem I did which the
47:16 - mapping should actually be right from 0
47:19 - to 59 minutes seconds 0 to 59 minutes
47:24 - and then zero - right because we don't
47:30 - get 12 we get 0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 11
47:33 - and then 12 again so 0 2 11 and this
47:38 - shouldn't say oh I also messed this up
47:39 - this shouldn't say right so let me know
47:45 - no 12 was right there there we go did I
47:49 - did I get it right with the minutes
47:51 - should be it should be zero 259 12 is
47:54 - fine with the modulus because it's going
47:56 - back to it right let's see
47:58 - 0 1 Oh No Oh one to twelve zero to 11
48:09 - time out yeah yes yes yes Matt I'm so
48:19 - sorry I'm so sorry
48:24 - so it's kind of hard to think about but
48:26 - it actually should be zero to 60 because
48:30 - 59 seconds does not end at the top it
48:33 - ends a little bit before that's why this
48:35 - should be zero to 12 and modulus 12 so I
48:38 - did this a few different ways but it is
48:40 - interesting to think about it but these
48:41 - are subtle little points but these
48:42 - should actually be 60 and now we've got
48:46 - the clock so I mean again I'm not
48:48 - suggesting this is a beautiful or
48:50 - interesting or wonderful clock in any
48:52 - way whatsoever what I'm doing is showing
48:54 - you that you can get the time
48:56 - information and you can map it to some
48:58 - kind of design system this is a
49:00 - tried-and-true kind of interesting
49:02 - exercise you can actually do this
49:05 - without knowing a lot about programming
49:07 - if you notice how to draw shapes and how
49:08 - to manipulate numbers that's really all
49:10 - you need for this the second hour and
49:12 - the minute function so I hope that
49:15 - everybody will try to make their own
49:17 - clock I'll try to think of an
49:18 - interesting way for to compile all these
49:21 - I don't know how to do that you got make
49:22 - out like a code pen thing the template I
49:25 - don't know so I share them with me in
49:27 - the comments on github and
49:31 - timeout coming up so actually zero point
49:41 - oh one two three sixty would be best I'm
49:43 - gonna leave it I'm gonna leave it at
49:45 - this should have the whole circle reduce
49:47 - after a minute is up and alternate yeah
49:49 - definitely people are giving me ad tix
49:52 - to prove your hypothesis if they align
49:54 - with the expected result fine I'm just
49:56 - reading the chat now to see if I should
49:58 - do anything else it does do something a
50:03 - little bit weird I probably should have
50:06 - just made I probably should just made
50:10 - like the minute hands and stuff so let
50:12 - me do that so this this coding challenge
50:20 - was about to end and I actually just
50:21 - wrapped up but I'm going to keep going
50:23 - actually cuz there's a lively discussion
50:24 - in the chat let's just sort of I don't
50:27 - know why what I probably should have
50:28 - done is just make a literal clock with
50:30 - minute second and our hands let's do
50:33 - that for a second let's actually put
50:35 - those lines there and see if this kind
50:37 - of maps with what we think it should be
50:38 - so I am going to in addition to drawing
50:42 - these arcs I'm going to draw a line I'm
50:48 - just going to do the second hand for a
50:50 - second from 0 0 to 100 comma 0 and I'm
50:56 - going to give it a stroke of 255 so I'm
51:00 - drawing this line straight up now I want
51:03 - that line to rotate according to that
51:08 - end angle and I'm gonna need to put push
51:12 - and pop around it because that rotation
51:15 - should only affect that line not the
51:16 - arcs so now we can see that is the
51:21 - actual second hand and while I'm letting
51:25 - that run for a little bit I'm going to
51:27 - and I'm just gonna put these at the end
51:29 - I should put this like I should this
51:31 - should be called I'm really second angle
51:34 - oh shoot I just lost my copy paste so
51:40 - I'm gonna do this here so this should be
51:43 - called
51:44 - this should be called second angle if
51:47 - I'm being worrier about this this should
51:49 - be called minute angle and this should
51:54 - be called hour angle if I want to be a
51:59 - bit more thoughtful second angle minute
52:04 - angle and now what I'm going to do is
52:08 - make these lines and I'm gonna do a
52:13 - second angle and I'm going to do a
52:22 - minute angle and hour angle and I'll
52:27 - make the minute 75 and the hour 50 and
52:30 - here we go so again I could be this is
52:34 - right now right it is now well okay I
52:40 - need these to be different colors is
52:41 - that that doesn't look right
52:44 - all right it's the minute angle number
52:48 - of minutes let's make this let's use the
52:52 - same colors I don't know why I put it
52:56 - down there now this is silly of me
52:57 - to separate these things that's the
53:00 - minute angle this is the hour up whoops
53:07 - this is the hour color and this is the
53:12 - second color I should draw a point in
53:16 - the middle that would be helpful and
53:18 - then let's also at the end just say
53:21 - stroke 255 point zero zero so there
53:26 - should be a nice little dot in the
53:27 - middle there we go
53:29 - so yeah this is the minute looks wrong
53:36 - you did something wrong with the minute
53:38 - six is right for the hour this seems
53:41 - reasonable for the seconds and then I
53:45 - must have messed something up about the
53:48 - minute minute from 0 to N equals minute
53:53 - let minute equal minute zero to 60 zero
53:56 - to 360
53:59 - let's look at 26 so why is the purple
54:07 - minute pointing up so let's look at
54:12 - console.log minute angle it's always 360
54:21 - so console dot log minute 26 0 what did
54:31 - I miss here oh I forgot oh look at this
54:35 - horrible typo I'm staring at it I should
54:38 - never do coding challenges after hours
54:40 - and hours of live streaming this I'm
54:41 - like I'd like three and a half hours of
54:42 - live streaming I just lost the word map
54:44 - there by accident there we go this is
54:49 - our clock oh it makes me happy that is
54:51 - actually kind of a nice looking clock
54:53 - and I don't know why I got distracted by
54:54 - this Ark thing if I were to just comment
54:56 - out the Ark's just for a second here
54:59 - this is the basic items this is the
55:04 - basic idea of making a clock so I have
55:07 - now made a clock in p5 in JavaScript but
55:11 - the point of me showing you is the arc
55:12 - and again it was not very creative is
55:14 - not very exciting that you can now take
55:15 - this basic idea of the code are and
55:18 - reading seconds minutes and hours from
55:23 - the p5 functions and drawing to your
55:25 - heart's content the most creative
55:27 - strange way look at the jaw my two
55:29 - clocks look at there's an the lecture by
55:31 - goal on Levin that I will include as a
55:33 - link in this video's description and
55:35 - look at the sum of the clock examples
55:37 - from alka and other users that also link
55:39 - from code pen and hold on so I want to
55:47 - check I don't know if one thing I think
55:49 - you mean interesting projects is porting
55:51 - all of John mydas original clocks from
55:53 - the 12 o'clock series if this is a loud
55:55 - thing to do to a p5 gs2 like allow those
55:59 - projects to live on and
56:01 - for people to see them in the browser
56:02 - and they're beautiful and interesting
56:03 - experiments so thanks for everyone for
56:06 - tuning in to this coding challenge I
56:08 - can't wait to see all the clocks that
56:09 - people make I will create a github page
56:12 - where you can submit them and there'll
56:13 - be a link to that in the video's
56:16 - description but you can also tweet me at
56:19 - Schiffman with your clocks or just write
56:22 - them in the comments and I'll to see
56:23 - them that way thanks for watching how
56:31 - did i do today everybody for my 100th
56:33 - livestream I think I unplugged something
56:42 - alright so I've got to go but I said I
56:45 - was gonna read 100 random numbers for
56:47 - today's 100th livestream so why is my
56:53 - music not working oh it is working
56:58 - alright everybody
57:00 - you should all leave now nobody wants
57:02 - nobody wants to listen to this but for
57:05 - the 100th livestream I am going to read
57:13 - oh I'll read page 100 let's do that yeah
57:21 - I'm gonna just check this slack chat
57:24 - thank you for all that
57:29 - we chat I should read the chat I'm
57:34 - looking for page 100 from the coding
57:36 - train storybook this live a heavy book I
57:42 - know I broke this wrist too by the way
57:43 - so the left isn't exactly didn't have to
57:46 - have surgery on you thankfully it's
57:47 - mostly healed foot so actually I can I
57:54 - know that this there's a very easy way
57:58 - for me to figure out what's 100 random
58:00 - numbers so each row here is 1 2 3 4 oh
58:05 - no this is the row number that's not the
58:06 - number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 numbers 1 2
58:11 - 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 each page so each page
58:22 - is 100 numbers I'm gonna give myself 100
58:26 - seconds oh no there's no way I can read
58:29 - a number a second yeah you mean that
58:32 - could I could read a number a second I'm
58:33 - gonna give myself one hundreds I should
58:37 - program my own timer 100 seconds is one
58:42 - minute 40 seconds I'm gonna give myself
58:45 - one minute 40 seconds the lullaby song
58:48 - is one minute that's no good that's fine
58:53 - I'm gonna get myself one seconds to read
58:57 - 100 numbers from I know Eric okay my
59:02 - timer from page 100 of a million random
59:05 - digits those of you who stayed all the
59:07 - way through this what is now probably I
59:09 - started this that was more like four
59:11 - o'clock this is only been two and a half
59:12 - hours here we go
59:16 - make this full screen right I'm not
59:20 - crazy
59:21 - one minute is 60 seconds 40 60 plus 40
59:24 - is 100
59:32 - and here we go 92108 77,000 0:33
59:37 - sixty-eight thousand three and twenty
59:38 - five to ten thousand won or sixty thirty
59:40 - eight thousand six seven sixty thousand
59:41 - forty one ace eighty seven oh two three
59:43 - wait wait hold on after restart we said
59:45 - this do I have to say do I have to say
59:50 - the do I have to say the like this
59:55 - that's should I just read it as a 9 3
59:58 - 108 drive to say ninety three thousand
60:00 - one hundred and eight I think I've have
60:01 - to say that thousand there's no way I
60:03 - could say 93 108 seven seven zero seven
60:05 - seven zero three three I think that's
60:06 - what I'm gonna do that's what I'm gonna
60:07 - do right right that's fine that was one
60:09 - point five okay here we go
60:12 - can I loop wait how do I loop my sound
60:16 - effects there's gotta be a way to loop
60:18 - it whatever I'm not gonna worry about
60:24 - that the lullaby will stop in the middle
60:27 - of I doesn't really work for this it
60:28 - needs to be something much more like
60:32 - [Music]
60:38 - 91 or eight seven seven zero three three
60:40 - six eight three to five 101 six zero six
60:42 - eight seven six two four four one eight
60:45 - seven two zero two three nine four three
60:46 - seven two zero six one six fours three
60:48 - zero seven zero zero two eight two seven
60:50 - one zero eight five eight nine eight
60:52 - three two seven nine four eight eight
60:53 - three eight six zero nine three five
60:55 - seven zero five four one five three
60:56 - eight one four nine five five five eight
60:58 - zero eight five three two eight zero two
61:00 - three five two one the thing is you just
61:04 - don't even know that I'm messing up
61:06 - does anybody have this book because I
61:09 - just like totally misread a bunch of the
61:11 - numbers hundred minutes I know I don't
61:13 - like rushing these numbers really need
61:15 - the amount of time that they need this
61:18 - one hundred thing gone too far 92108
61:31 - 77033 sixty-eight thousand three hundred
61:33 - twenty-five ten thousand one hundred
61:36 - sixty thirty-eight thousand six hundred
61:38 - sixty seven sixty two thousand four
61:41 - hundred forty-one eighty seven thousand
61:43 - twenty three ninety four thousand three
61:45 - hundred and seventy two 6160 for thirty
61:50 - thousand seven hundred twenty-eight
61:52 - thousand two hundred seventy one eight
61:54 - thousand five hundred eighty nine eighty
61:56 - three thousand two hundred and seventy
61:58 - nine forty eight thousand eight hundred
62:00 - thirty-eight sixty thousand nine hundred
62:02 - thirty-five seventy thousand five
62:04 - hundred forty one fifty three thousand
62:07 - eight hundred fourteen ninety five
62:09 - thousand five hundred eighty-eight 5832
62:13 - eighty thousand 235 twenty one thousand
62:17 - eight hundred forty one thirty five
62:19 - thousand five hundred forty-five eleven
62:21 - thousand one hundred and forty eight
62:23 - thirty four thousand seven seventy five
62:25 - seventeen thousand three hundred and
62:27 - eight 88 thousand
62:32 - most buy place there's 88,000 Oh thirty
62:35 - four ninety seven thousand seven hundred
62:37 - sixty five thirty five thousand nine
62:39 - hundred fifty nine fifty two thousand
62:42 - eight hundred forty three forty four
62:44 - thousand eight hundred ninety five we
62:46 - should go home for dinner
62:47 - twenty two thousand twenty five that was
62:50 - thirty numbers by the way so far son I'm
62:52 - getting there
62:53 - what we'll wait a second ten wait a
62:56 - second no no no no no no no I lost my
63:02 - mind I totally lost my mind I'm the
63:06 - worst at math it's worse than anybody in
63:09 - the entire world we have to read to hear
63:13 - one two three four five six seven eight
63:16 - nine ten I have to read the whole page
63:18 - one two three four five six seven eight
63:21 - nine ten I was like I was halfway done
63:25 - the whole page is one two three four
63:28 - five six seven eight nine ten is fifty
63:30 - fifty rows of ten 500 500 per page I'm
63:39 - so close to being done
63:40 - I know two throws anybody know the last
63:43 - number I read somebody help me with the
63:45 - last number I read yeah by the way I'm
63:49 - definitely gonna make an audiobook of
63:50 - this and sell it become very original
63:51 - just write a text-to-speech program that
63:53 - doesn't 34 something 34 something I'd
64:03 - like to know what the last number I read
64:05 - is do I need maybe I need to start over
64:06 - to I need to start over because it needs
64:08 - to be like continuous nobody will tell
64:10 - me the last number it's 80 something
64:15 - 3480 something nobody can scroll back in
64:19 - time and tell me can't you do that
64:22 - 88 something doesn't this fancy internet
64:27 - live-streaming thing to like allow
64:29 - people to go back in time eighty-eight
64:35 - thousand 34 I'm getting twenty two
64:37 - thousand twenty five I'm getting a bunch
64:38 - of different numbers
64:39 - I think eighty eight thousand 34 by the
64:42 - way I have terrible vision this is like
64:44 - very hard for me
64:45 - to read 88,000 there is no 88,000 34
64:50 - that I can find I think I bet I think
64:51 - just better start over better start over
64:54 - it's not that much to read oh people are
64:58 - say 22,000 25 okay I'm getting that from
65:01 - some reliable sources problem is that I
65:04 - read the correct number 22,000 there's a
65:07 - twenty thousand six hundred four 22 does
65:11 - anybody have a copy of this book Oh
65:13 - twenty thousand twenty-five pound it
65:16 - okay so I read twenty two thousand
65:18 - twenty five yes
65:22 - seventy-nine thousand five hundred
65:24 - fifty-four nineteen thousand six hundred
65:27 - ninety eight twenty five thousand two
65:29 - hundred fifty five fifty thousand two
65:32 - hundred eighty three ninety four
65:33 - thousand thirty seven fifty seven
65:35 - thousand four hundred sixty three ninety
65:38 - two thousand nine hundred twenty-five
65:39 - twelve thousand 4290 1414 looks look
65:49 - please oh nine thousand two hundred ten
65:52 - twenty thousand seven hundred seventy
65:54 - nine two thousand nine hundred
65:56 - ninety-four 2258 eighty-six thousand
66:01 - nine hundred and seventy eight eighty
66:03 - five thousand ninety two fifty four
66:05 - thousand fifty two 18350 for twenty
66:10 - thousand nine hundred and fourteen
66:12 - twenty eight thousand four hundred sixty
66:14 - halfway done children children but I
66:18 - like this as a bedtime story
66:20 - ninety thousand I gotta bring this home
66:22 - because it'll be 90 thousand five
66:25 - hundred fifty to seventy one thousand
66:27 - one hundred twenty-nine three thousand
66:29 - six hundred twenty one twenty thousand
66:32 - five hundred seventeen sixteen 6668
66:40 - twenty nine thousand nine hundred
66:43 - sixteen fifty one thousand five hundred
66:47 - thirty-seven then two thousand six
66:51 - hundred fifty eight twenty nine thousand
66:52 - five hundred twenty-five one thousand
66:54 - one hundred thirty six thousand nine
66:56 - hundred ninety five twenty thousand
66:57 - twenty fifty eight ten thousand fifty
66:59 - one ninety-nine thousand twenty forty
67:01 - eight fifty one thousand two hundred

67:03 - sixty one three nine six hundred sixty
67:05 - eight seventy four thousand seven

67:19 - seven hundred eighty eight thirty eight
67:20 - thousand three hundred and fifty eight
67:22 - fifty nine thousand eight hundred and
67:24 - twenty seven nineteen thousand that's my
67:29 - place again because I looked at the chat
67:30 - in two thousand two hundred seventy
67:32 - ninety nine thousand two hundred eighty
67:34 - seven eighty one thousand one hundred
67:36 - ninety three forty three thousand three

68:32 - hundred eighty seven sixty nine thousand
68:34 - two hundred and forty-six eighty-six
68:38 - thousand and four hundred twenty-nine
68:47 - thousand five hundred fifty-nine thank
68:57 - you all for tuning in to this week's the
68:59 - coding train and all of the stuff that
69:02 - we messed up and couldn't possibly do
69:03 - checking like Twitter messages one more
69:05 - time I don't have a message
69:07 - so I anybody who wants to uh I don't
69:13 - know if much uh if you want to edit that
69:17 - anybody wants to remix that in some
69:20 - interesting way that would make me so
69:21 - happy musical music video level by going
69:25 - to sleep thanks everyone for watching I
69:27 - hope some of the stuff that I did today
69:28 - was useful and helpful and it wasn't too
69:30 - much of a mess I just mess up too many
69:33 - times and that you're all not staying up
69:35 - too far past your bedtime I am very late
69:38 - to get home it is now 6:40 and I am
69:43 - going to leave now so thank you this was
69:47 - the live stream 100 Phoenix and the chat
69:50 - is asking when is the next livestream so
69:53 - I'm trying to consistently livestream
69:55 - every Friday afternoon so any check
69:58 - Friday morning bye and when I'm going to
70:00 - give the times and getting you Eastern
70:01 - Eastern Time
70:03 - New York City time so usually by twelve
70:06 - o'clock that day I'll schedule the exact
70:08 - time typically I would start some the
70:11 - earliest I would start would probably be
70:12 - two o'clock the latest I was starting to
70:14 - be four or five o'clock and then every
70:16 - once awhile on a Friday I might even do
70:17 - it earlier in the day for because I know
70:19 - there's a lot of international folks
70:20 - were this livestream is in the middle
70:21 - tonight for them but so I try to find a
70:24 - two-hour pocket of time every Friday
70:25 - that I'm available I should really just
70:27 - do it same time every week really look
70:30 - about over apologizing for this good
70:32 - lens so neurotic about not having an
70:35 - exact
70:35 - time so yes so next Friday I don't think
70:40 - there's a couple Fridays in that Ole
70:42 - Miss I will get back to the machine
70:43 - learning stuff and I wanted to do I want
70:48 - to do something on quadtrees was kind of
70:50 - like in my mind is like that's kind of
70:52 - important I didn't do the custom shapes
70:53 - so I know so I'll come back next week
