00:00 - hello welcome to my first video beyond
00:02 - my introductory video about making
00:04 - chatbots and again I am using something
00:08 - called rive script and open source an
00:12 - open source library for chatbots
00:14 - link to the github repository thank you
00:17 - to the creators and maintainer zuv rive
00:19 - script it's a wonderful project I've
00:20 - used it and a lot of things before and I
00:22 - really enjoy using it so I'm gonna try
00:24 - to show you a bit about how it works I
00:26 - am NOT some sort of official
00:27 - representative of the rive script
00:29 - project I'm just a user and fan of write
00:31 - script the idea of Rive script is to is
00:35 - pattern matching is a is it it's
00:37 - basically a chatbot system that uses a
00:39 - technique called pattern matching and
00:41 - retrieval oh those are the right terms
00:43 - let me describe to you what I do the
00:47 - user says something hello that goes into
00:54 - the chatbox brain the brain does
00:59 - something so this is input and then
01:04 - gives a reply hi we could actually make
01:10 - a chat I know it's shocking I know we
01:13 - could program a chat bot that does this
01:15 - anytime the user says ha hello and then
01:17 - I could be typed in or spoken in
01:19 - depending on what sort of what our
01:21 - interactive what our what medium we're
01:23 - we're kind of deploying this chat bot
01:25 - says hello and the reply which the word
01:28 - reply has an L in it guess we're
01:31 - wondering says hi so rive script is the
01:35 - thing that i want to use here i want it
01:38 - to be the brain of the chat bot it's not
01:40 - the only option in the world for
01:42 - programming or creating a chat bot brain
01:44 - but it is one option i am going to start
01:47 - at least by using javascript and p5.js
01:49 - to take my input and display my reply so
01:52 - I'm gonna build a simple chat bot that
01:54 - just runs in the browser program with
01:56 - JavaScript to the p5 just library but
01:57 - I'm gonna have its brain driven by rive
01:59 - script and this brain uses a technique
02:02 - called pattern matching so ultimately
02:07 - there are so many different kinds of
02:08 - things we could put into this brain that
02:10 - are super sophisticated but one thing I
02:12 - could actually do is just say did the
02:14 - users say exactly this word hello or did
02:17 - it say the word hello or hi or howdy can
02:20 - I match one of these possible phrases
02:22 - that the user said and if it said one of
02:25 - these possible phrases then I'm gonna
02:26 - say this exact reply this is the idea of
02:30 - Rive script and so every rive script is
02:34 - really just a markup syntax for
02:36 - configuring different sorts of expected
02:39 - patterns much like a regular expression
02:41 - if you look at my regular expression
02:42 - tutorials that you might expect the user
02:44 - to say and the replies that should come
02:47 - with those patterns so every so the way
02:50 - arrives and rie script is modeled off of
02:52 - something called a I M L artificial
02:59 - intelligence markup language which is an
03:00 - XML like tag based markup thing that is
03:04 - interesting you could also use but rice
03:06 - script has a bit of a simpler syntax so
03:08 - in rice script every single was just a
03:11 - text file every single line in the text
03:14 - file begins with a command symbol so
03:17 - some possible command symbols aren't
03:20 - exclamation point plus minus and pound
03:24 - or hash tag so for example this chat bot
03:27 - that I want to program would look like
03:29 - this hello hi
03:35 - which means the plus means this is the
03:40 - pattern I want to match as the input and
03:42 - the reply that I want to give to that
03:45 - input is the - this is the reply now one
03:49 - thing I could do is I could have two
03:51 - possible replies so the first thing I
03:54 - can do in rie script is configure an
03:56 - input that I'm looking for and then give
03:58 - a set of possible replies and rive
04:01 - script will pick one of those randomly
04:03 - there actually isn't even a syntax for
04:05 - waiting these so I could say 90% of the
04:08 - time I want to say hi and 10% of the
04:10 - time I want to say howdy so you know
04:12 - that's a level of detail that I don't
04:14 - think I need right now for what I'm
04:15 - gonna try to demonstrate but that is
04:17 - possible so you might be asking the
04:18 - question okay if that's the basic idea
04:21 - well how do I learn what all the
04:24 - possible thing
04:24 - I could put in here are and and
04:26 - hopefully I'm going to show you some of
04:28 - them I don't actually really I don't
04:29 - have them memorized so I'm gonna have to
04:30 - like learn them and figure them out as I
04:32 - go a bit and and and and how where do I
04:38 - learn that stuff so and and where can I
04:40 - test out so could I test out a brain
04:43 - configuration without having to write my
04:45 - own JavaScript code so yes yes yes all
04:48 - of the above just come over here with me
04:50 - oh look we're over here so this is the
04:55 - rive script website I find if you go to
04:57 - just rise script calm you'll come to the
04:59 - main web page but under here a slash
05:02 - Doc's tutorial this is a wonderful
05:04 - walkthrough of all the possible features
05:06 - and you can see here I'm gonna skip some
05:08 - stuff here about you can say here here
05:11 - is the your first chat bot same thing
05:13 - that I've said exclamation point is a
05:16 - kind of command symbol for like a
05:18 - configuration thing you can actually
05:20 - store variables and different things
05:21 - like that in the chat bot which I will
05:22 - get to so we want to be compatible with
05:24 - version 2.0 of Rive script and I want a
05:27 - plus to say hello bot and a minus to say
05:29 - I want to I want to look for the user
05:31 - saying hello bot and I want the bot say
05:34 - hello human so let's go and actually
05:36 - test this now there's something called
05:37 - the rice grip playground and I'm gonna
05:39 - get rid of this part of it so here is
05:42 - that chat bot in the rice crud
05:44 - playground and I can say well I'm gonna
05:47 - say run so I can down here say hello
05:50 - bot and it says hello to you men and I'm
05:55 - going to say hi hi bot and it says error
06:00 - no match reply no no reply match so
06:03 - here's the first thing I want to do I
06:05 - would like to have something that's a
06:07 - catch-all of response for anything I
06:09 - don't know about let's add that so just
06:12 - like in regular expressions where you
06:13 - have meta characters and literal
06:16 - characters and this is what I'm saying
06:18 - here is like I want to match exactly
06:20 - hello bot and notice there's no
06:21 - capitalization here so capitalization
06:24 - and punctuation don't really play a role
06:26 - in the patterns that you're matching
06:27 - you're just looking for the raw text but
06:30 - I can have wildcards so I couldn't say
06:33 - something like Apple I love apples
06:38 - - or apples are delicious so now I'm
06:43 - using a wild card
06:44 - so Apple anything after Apple will give
06:47 - you one of these responses so now if I
06:49 - run it Apple you eat question mark
06:54 - apples are delicious Apple Apple Apple
06:57 - Apple Apple I love apples to see we even
07:00 - got one the different one the second
07:02 - time but if I say hello Apple error no
07:05 - reply matched so this is one way you can
07:08 - use a chat bot to kind of just realize
07:10 - that the users kind of brought up a
07:12 - certain topic so for example if you want
07:14 - to say any where the word Apple appears
07:17 - if the user says anything with Apple say
07:20 - like oh let's talk about apples and then
07:25 - I can also use a complete and total just
07:27 - one star as a wildcard to say like I
07:31 - prefer to discuss fruit so now I'm gonna
07:36 - run my chat bot and I'm going to say
07:39 - hello bot hello cumin and I'm gonna say
07:42 - I'm gonna say let's discuss pokemons and
07:47 - then rock group says I prefer to discuss
07:49 - fruit oh I love apples and oh no oh no
07:55 - what happened here so look at this oh I
07:58 - love apples ROG script is saying I
08:01 - prefer to discuss fruit am I still
08:03 - making a video about chat BOTS in this
08:05 - is actually like what I'm talking about
08:07 - oh boy hopefully this is OK here so I
08:10 - think what's going on here is I have
08:11 - Apple space star and maybe if I did
08:15 - Apple star like that then now I could
08:19 - say oh I love apples oh let's talk about
08:23 - apples so that space was actually
08:26 - matching their the Apple space star I
08:28 - needed to have I couldn't you I couldn't
08:30 - match apples okay anyway so do you get
08:34 - the basic idea here this we could see
08:36 - here so this is very little like this is
08:38 - just like all I we've learned so far is
08:39 - I can match something exactly or I can
08:42 - match something with a wild card there
08:44 - are many more things that you can do so
08:48 - let's add a few more things to this chat
08:50 - bot now one thing that I
08:52 - would like to mention is that the the
08:54 - the these are the the plus elements
08:58 - without I've been calling inputs are
08:59 - actually called triggers so the term for
09:00 - that is trigger and you'll actually see
09:02 - in some modern chatbot systems this word
09:05 - called intent so we're trying to match
09:08 - the intention of the user
09:10 - what if which in what is their intention
09:12 - and not what would i if what is it that
09:15 - they want to do and i need to reply
09:16 - accordingly so one thing that you we can
09:18 - do that's nice about these wildcards is
09:24 - we can also use what the person said in
09:26 - the wild-card in the reply so i can say
09:28 - what if the user says my name is star
09:31 - and i could say nice to meet you and
09:35 - then star so i can refer back to what
09:39 - they said by putting star in the the is
09:42 - greater than a less than so i can say my
09:47 - name is coating train now interestingly
09:50 - enough nice to meet you coding train and
09:53 - it didn't keep my capitalization and
09:55 - there's probably some way that i can
09:57 - configure that we could look through the
09:58 - documentation and that's a little bit
10:00 - weird that my name is coding train but
10:02 - so that's one thing you can do we can
10:03 - also have multiple stars so i could do
10:07 - something like my name is star star and
10:11 - then i could change that nice to meet
10:13 - you star i could be like really weird
10:17 - about this star two comma star one so
10:20 - like for example my name is daniel she
10:26 - mon nice to meet you chief man comma
10:31 - daniel because this is a thought who
10:33 - likes to speak very formally so you can
10:35 - see here that you can match the
10:37 - different different stars in a
10:39 - particular order so again there is
10:41 - nothing going there's this is there's no
10:44 - type of learning or training i am
10:46 - configuring precise patterns for the
10:50 - bots to look for with certain replies a
10:53 - question is coming up in the chat which
10:55 - is great which is like well what if you
10:57 - what if the user asks something about
10:59 - the weather and you wanted to say well
11:01 - the web the temperature today is
11:02 - blank so this would be some this is why
11:05 - I want to combine drive script with
11:06 - JavaScript and I'm gonna do this in the
11:08 - next video but this is just essentially
11:10 - the script for the brain but there's no
11:12 - reason if I'm not if I'm using this
11:13 - brain in my own code that I couldn't
11:15 - also inject something like an API call
11:18 - so I will have you know there's no I
11:20 - could write my own program to do a lot
11:22 - if elseis if conditional statements and
11:24 - regular expressions that I don't need
11:26 - rive script for but riah script is a
11:27 - nice syntax for me able to configure a
11:30 - really elaborate set of possible
11:32 - possibilities and then I can combine
11:34 - that with coding to do something much
11:36 - more dynamic so that's really where I'm
11:37 - trying to go with this here so I want to
11:39 - look at a few more features in rai
11:41 - scripts an important feature of Rive
11:43 - script is substitutions because you know
11:46 - you might have something where the the
11:50 - chat bot might say who is there not the
11:54 - chat bot the trigger you're looking for
11:56 - is who is there but the user might say
11:57 - who's there or who is there and so
11:59 - something you can do in Rive script is
12:01 - configure all these different
12:03 - substitutions meaning these are
12:05 - equivalent substitute I'm for I am
12:08 - substitute I'd for I would so you can
12:10 - put I M in your chat bot let's do this
12:14 - right here let's put this here I'm gonna
12:19 - add this as a substitution at the top
12:21 - and now I'm going to say I'm going to
12:27 - say I'm oh I'm just gonna change this to
12:32 - I'm though I am sorry and now I'm gonna
12:37 - run this and I can say I am Dan
12:41 - Schiffman
12:42 - nice to meet you shift in comma Dan or
12:44 - I'm ship I'm Dan Schiffman same thing so
12:49 - now I have a substitution so this is a
12:52 - way that I can have this particular
12:54 - phrase and so one thing that you can
12:55 - actually do that we'll see is that you
12:57 - can have separate files that make up the
13:00 - brain so this thing that I'm talking
13:02 - about all these files can be a can have
13:07 - the dot rive extension and you could
13:09 - have many many many of these so you
13:11 - could have one file that just has a
13:13 - thousand substitutions in it
13:15 - and you could use that as part of the
13:16 - brain you could use that for multiple
13:17 - projects and and it you could just carry
13:19 - that file along with you so once you've
13:21 - made one chatbot or you're using
13:22 - somebody else's chat bar you got an
13:24 - example chat bot you can divide things
13:25 - in different files to kind of keep
13:26 - organized and reuse stuff another key
13:32 - feature is variables so I think there's
13:34 - two more things that I want to talk
13:35 - about one is variables and one is
13:37 - sequencing so how do you do variables so
13:39 - I'm pretty sure that you can just do
13:40 - stuff like var var name equals computer
13:47 - and then I think
13:49 - nice to meet you star and and then so if
13:52 - the if the user says who are you you
13:55 - could say I am name I think this is how
13:58 - this works I'm actually kind of
13:59 - speculating I think you can set up a
14:01 - name and then you can say I am that name
14:05 - so let's see if that works
14:07 - who are you I am blank so that's not
14:11 - right so much for me just making up what
14:13 - rice group does let's look for it in the
14:15 - tutorial okay so I found the spot in the
14:18 - tutorial I apologize you have to if you
14:20 - want to display the value of variable
14:22 - you have to use get as well so what I
14:24 - missed here is I am get name so I'm
14:28 - gonna run this now and I'm gonna say who
14:30 - are you I am undefined how what did I
14:36 - get wrong so it appears that for the
14:39 - variables that you set up at the top you
14:42 - can actually retrieve their values not
14:43 - with get but with the keyword bots get
14:46 - is something that I'm going to show you
14:47 - in a minute that's four variables that
14:49 - you've set in a different way using set
14:50 - so maybe I'm missing a few important
14:52 - details here that I will try to get to
14:54 - but so what I need to do is if I want to
14:56 - retrieve that variable I use bot name so
14:58 - these are like kind of almost like fixed
15:01 - constants or settings for the particular
15:03 - bot so I can say now I can say who are
15:06 - are you and it can said I am computer
15:10 - the reason why this is useful is I could
15:11 - use bot name in all sorts of places in
15:13 - my chat bot and then I if I wanted to
15:16 - change its name later I could just
15:17 - change it at the top so it's a way of
15:18 - setting just like the reason why you
15:20 - might use variables in coding the same
15:22 - reason why you might use
15:23 - now here's the interesting thing
15:24 - sometimes you might want to remember
15:26 - something the user says so for example
15:31 - let's say let's say what you what you
15:38 - though the user says my favorite
15:42 - favorite color is star now one thing I
15:46 - should mention is there ways of setting
15:48 - up specific options only that they're a
15:51 - valid like it has to be a number or it
15:53 - has to be a word or has to be one of
15:54 - these three words then you can have a
15:56 - different reply if it doesn't fit that
15:57 - that but but for right now I'm just
15:59 - gonna say my favorite color is anything
16:01 - and what I want to do is say oh I love
16:05 - and I can do set color equals star
16:09 - something like this too
16:11 - so this is this idea of in addition to
16:17 - displaying back what the user said I
16:19 - could store that in another variable now
16:21 - I might not have gotten this syntax
16:22 - exactly right let's go look at the
16:24 - tutorial so I'm gonna search for the
16:26 - part of the tutorial that's using set so
16:28 - yeah so set Nate I set name equal star
16:31 - so actually what I should do is put this
16:33 - at the beginning and then I can say get
16:35 - if I want to actually use that and I
16:36 - could use that later too
16:37 - so for I did that wrong so let's do this
16:40 - was right set color equals star and then
16:44 - I could say oh I love get color too and
16:48 - let me give myself a bit more room here
16:50 - so that fits in one line I know I'm
16:53 - gonna be standing in front of it but we
16:56 - can see here okay so now what I can do
16:58 - is if the user says my favorite color is
17:03 - blue
17:04 - oh I love blue - but I haven't only
17:08 - spent sent something back to the user
17:10 - what I can actually say I am but who are
17:15 - you I am bought name and my favorite
17:18 - color is get color so this is a way now
17:22 - that the bot will always say back the
17:27 - same favorite color that the user has
17:29 - said so now we can say my favorite color
17:34 - is purple which is actually my favorite
17:36 - color
17:37 - and then I can say who are you I am a
17:39 - computer and my favorite color is purple
17:41 - so we can actually use stuff that the
17:43 - user is saying store that information
17:45 - and save it later so you could imagine
17:47 - if you're creating a bot to have a
17:49 - conversation over a period of time
17:50 - that's gonna remember stuff about the
17:52 - user this could be incredibly useful so
17:54 - the important thing here is the
17:56 - difference between bot variables which
17:58 - are the ones you set up at the top and
17:59 - other variables that you're setting
18:01 - during the conversation with set so I
18:05 - have a set of examples that will include
18:07 - front links from this video that mostly
18:10 - pull from that tutorial I'm just going
18:12 - to kind of show you those right now
18:13 - because we could spend forever like
18:15 - showing you each possible configuration
18:16 - but I think once you get the basic idea
18:18 - of how it works
18:19 - you can read through the documentation
18:21 - yourself the key thing here that I want
18:23 - to demonstrate to you is the next step
18:25 - which is actually using this in your own
18:26 - program in JavaScript which is pretty
18:28 - exciting and interesting so this is some
18:30 - of an example that I have so I already
18:32 - talked to you about star which means
18:34 - match anything and you can you can say
18:37 - you could have different stars star 1
18:39 - star 2 you can have a catch-all you can
18:42 - match only a number so if if the if it's
18:47 - not a number you could you could match
18:49 - you could you could say back like oh
18:51 - please give me a number
18:52 - you can match only A to Z characters you
18:55 - can have something optional like if the
18:57 - user says what is your phone number or
18:58 - what is your number optional anything is
19:02 - a nice way to match a topic so if so if
19:05 - the this is sort of us doing this
19:07 - earlier you can see if the user uses the
19:09 - word JavaScript anywhere can you teach
19:11 - me to program in JavaScript you can use
19:13 - in other so if the user says I love
19:16 - purple or I love pink you could say what
19:17 - about red so this is a lot of this
19:19 - you'll notice the syntax is very similar
19:20 - to regular expressions and you can also
19:23 - use an array so I was kind of mentioning
19:25 - this before right you can set up an
19:26 - array of different options and then you
19:29 - can say what if the user says anything
19:32 - that matches anything from that array so
19:35 - there are so many Possible's possible
19:38 - configurations that's just a little bit
19:40 - I'm trying to think if I missed anything
19:43 - else that I wanted to show you in here
19:45 - learning I mentioned in terms of like
19:48 - saving information
19:50 - oh and you can also have conditionals so
19:53 - so this is really great so one thing
19:55 - let's try this actually so let's try to
19:57 - use I think the age is a good except it
20:00 - a number oh yeah this would be a great
20:03 - chat bot where the bot thinks of a
20:05 - number and the user has to like guess
20:07 - the number so maybe actually that's what
20:09 - we'll do when I get to the JavaScript
20:11 - example so let's not worry too much
20:12 - about this right now you can see that if
20:15 - if the if the bot says if the user sorry
20:19 - if the trigger is it's always very
20:20 - confusing I keep saying the wrong thing
20:21 - if the user says and my older than you
20:24 - if the users age that was set up here is
20:27 - greater than 10 say you are I am 10 if
20:30 - the users age is less than or equal to
20:33 - 10 nope I am 10 so this is like saying
20:35 - that the bots age is 10 and incidentally
20:37 - I could make that a bot variable as well
20:41 - or a user set variable because maybe the
20:44 - user says how old the bot is I don't
20:45 - know so there's so many possibilities
20:47 - here I hope this gives you boy this was
20:49 - a really terribly disorganized
20:51 - introduction to Rive script I you know
20:53 - admittedly I was really figuring it out
20:54 - as I went I don't know write script that
20:56 - well but I kind of did this for myself
20:58 - to remind me how it is and what it does
21:00 - and now I want to take that next step
21:02 - and use rive script in a JavaScript
21:04 - program you could and you can use one of
21:06 - the things I love about writing scripts
21:08 - is it's open source it's MIT license and
21:09 - you can use it in a variety of
21:11 - programming languages I'm using in
21:12 - JavaScript so I'll see you in the next
21:14 - video where I'm going to do that
21:20 - [Music]
