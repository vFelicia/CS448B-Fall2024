00:00 - hello and welcome to another Q&A video
00:03 - so this question was submitted by
00:06 - McClinton Justin on github and the
00:09 - question is how to use p5 or processing
00:12 - as a background for a website okay so
00:15 - this is a very broad question because
00:17 - it's gonna mean a lot of things like
00:18 - well what are you what's your p5 GS or
00:20 - process the thing doing and what is your
00:22 - website so I'm gonna boil this down to a
00:24 - specific scenario and then as I show you
00:28 - a demonstration of this scenario that
00:29 - I'm thinking in my head I'll talk about
00:31 - other possible scenarios that might fit
00:33 - into this and other avenues that you
00:35 - might think about kind of combining
00:37 - animated sketch or dynamic JavaScript
00:40 - thing with quote-unquote website um so I
00:44 - have a website that I made it's about
00:46 - unicorns and rainbows
00:47 - I found that image of a unicorn on the
00:50 - Internet and I wrote a little header and
00:52 - then I pulled a quote from Wikipedia so
00:54 - this so well on the one hand here's one
00:58 - scenario you have a website that you've
01:00 - made perhaps it's your blog perhaps it's
01:03 - your own website however you made it
01:04 - ultimately it's just sitting there and
01:06 - it's a page of content and that content
01:08 - is you know kind of hard-coded or
01:10 - written content perhaps via whatever
01:12 - mechanism you're using and you can see
01:14 - where I have that here I have this just
01:17 - written into an HTML file index dot HTML
01:20 - now if this is has a reference to p5
01:24 - libraries in it as well but it just has
01:26 - like the header a paragraph with an
01:28 - image in it and a paragraph with like a
01:30 - quote from Wikipedia so let's just say
01:32 - here's here's one possible scenario what
01:35 - if you what you want what what what you
01:37 - want is to have this website that you
01:39 - could suddenly draw over it so you could
01:41 - kind of like annotate it and you could
01:42 - imagine this eventually becoming
01:44 - something like a Chrome extension which
01:45 - any page that you're on you could press
01:48 - the button and through this like Chrome
01:50 - extension what does a Chrome extension
01:50 - you might be asking that's ok if you're
01:53 - asking that but the idea of a layer on
01:55 - top of any website that you're browsing
01:57 - to augment that experience so and I'm
01:59 - gonna do that in the future video for
02:01 - sure but let's just kind of make it work
02:02 - with the website of my own making here
02:05 - so what I'm gonna do is I have a p5
02:08 - sketch and I'm going to say create
02:09 - canvas and I'm going to just say create
02:12 - canvas 400 by
02:13 - 400 and then I'm gonna say background
02:18 - zero just so we see it there so what
02:22 - happened this adds a canvas to the
02:24 - bottom so in the one hand I'm kind of
02:26 - combining some JavaScript code with some
02:28 - pre-written HTML code and by default p5
02:31 - will just place that canvas at the
02:33 - bottom so another thing that I could do
02:36 - here is I could say well I could use the
02:39 - Dom library and I could store a
02:42 - reference to the canvas in a variable
02:44 - and I could then use something called
02:49 - absolute positioning and I could say
02:52 - position that canvas at 0-0 so now you
02:57 - can see uh
02:58 - the canvas is there but it's covering
03:00 - over covering the page well this is this
03:04 - might be what you want it might not be
03:05 - what you want but let's say that's not
03:07 - what you want well a trick to keeping
03:10 - track of the order of elements kind of
03:13 - the layers of elements is to use a CSS
03:15 - property known as Z index Z index kind
03:18 - of like of the like the z axis like our
03:22 - things in front or behind so I am going
03:25 - to now say canvas dot style Z index and
03:31 - I'm gonna give it a z-index of negative
03:33 - 1 because probably all the other things
03:36 - just have a default Z index of 0 I think
03:38 - that's the case so now you can see it's
03:41 - sitting behind the page now because it's
03:43 - black I can't see the text so I'm gonna
03:46 - say 220 just to get it you can see on
03:48 - let's let's make it
03:50 - 175 you can see there's the canvas now
03:52 - what if I want the canvas to kind of be
03:55 - the background of the entire page so
03:57 - instead of saying 400 by 400 I can say
04:00 - window width I think this is right
04:03 - window height these are built-in
04:05 - variables in p5 that dynamically detect
04:08 - the width and height of that browser
04:10 - page and and create the canvas at that
04:15 - size so you can see there we go now one
04:17 - thing you'll notice if I resize it's not
04:20 - actually changing so I'm gonna I'm going
04:23 - to fix that in a second but let's at
04:25 - least add some sort of animation
04:28 - I wish let's say just because what I was
04:32 - doing in a previous video is I'm gonna
04:34 - connect to my microphone so oh I don't
04:41 - have this sounds library I this is I'm
04:45 - gonna connect to the microphone and I'm
04:47 - gonna say Mike dot start and now I'm
04:49 - just gonna give me a volume which is
04:52 - Mike get level and I'm gonna draw an
04:57 - ellipse in the center of the canvas with
05:01 - a size of volume times 100 so let's see
05:06 - if this works
05:07 - and I know that I'm getting an error
05:09 - because this is the error I'm getting
05:12 - because I didn't actually import the
05:13 - sounds library so I'm going to add p5
05:18 - sound j/s here and now you should say
05:21 - okay so now I have a web page with it's
05:23 - responding to my voice kind of with this
05:25 - like canvas in the background and just
05:27 - to be clear about this I'm gonna
05:30 - multiply it by you know like 5 the width
05:34 - of the window so now we can see that
05:37 - this circle is always going to be there
05:38 - behind the page now what I want to do is
05:41 - as I resize the browser right
05:43 - I want that circle to always sort of
05:45 - stay in the center and the canvas to
05:47 - resize itself so here is where I need to
05:49 - focus on a particular event what I want
05:55 - to do is add an event and that event is
05:57 - window resize I think I think that's the
06:03 - event so p5 has a global function you
06:05 - can write just like you can write a
06:06 - global mouse press function for whenever
06:08 - a mouse clicks anywhere on the page
06:09 - let's just see I'm gonna just
06:13 - console.log the word resize to see if
06:16 - this is correct yeah so you can see that
06:19 - whenever I change the size of the window
06:22 - this particular this this particular
06:26 - event is being triggered so what I can
06:28 - do actually in here is I can call a p5
06:31 - function called resize canvas resize
06:34 - canvas will recreate that same canvas
06:37 - with a new window width and window
06:39 - height so I can give it this
06:41 - sort of currently updated window within
06:43 - window height I think this is correct
06:44 - and I'm gonna do this and you can see
06:47 - it's continuing to work so now I have
06:49 - this idea of a p5 sketch and the reason
06:53 - why the thing about it is a p5 sketch
06:55 - isn't just a canvas right you can do so
06:57 - much a p5 sketch is a sketch that allows
07:00 - you to control the behavior of a webpage
07:02 - in a much more generic sense so I could
07:04 - be manipulating the Dom elements and
07:06 - moving that Unicorn picture around and
07:08 - doing so much more but now at least you
07:10 - see this idea of the canvas a p5 canvas
07:14 - as the background of a particular sketch
07:19 - and being able to manipulative as the as
07:26 - the browser is being manipulated so now
07:28 - there's a couple more things that I want
07:31 - to add to this you know so there's
07:32 - another scenario that might be relevant
07:34 - to you for example what if what I want
07:37 - to do and I don't know if this is gonna
07:38 - I'm gonna comment out the mic stuff and
07:42 - the ellipse and I'm actually gonna put
07:45 - background in setup and I'm going to say
07:49 - if Mouse press oh if mouse is pressed I
07:53 - want to draw a line from P Mouse X to P
07:59 - and P Mouse Y to Mouse X and mouse Y if
08:03 - you're wondering what P Mouse X and P
08:04 - Mouse why are there the previous Mouse
08:07 - position why am i doing this is because
08:09 - what I want is to be able to do this so
08:12 - this is something you might think about
08:14 - which is sort of like this ability to
08:16 - annotate a page now in this case
08:19 - remember I've done all this effort like
08:21 - putting the canvas behind right because
08:24 - if I don't call this the index thing
08:28 - then the canvas is actually in front of
08:31 - all that content however there's no and
08:35 - even if if I do this however you can see
08:38 - there's it actually works so a canvas by
08:41 - default is actually transparent so you
08:43 - only have this issue is if you want to
08:46 - draw a background and in fact I thought
08:49 - I was going to have to do this but I'll
08:52 - show you I could add mousepressed
08:54 - and add the clear function here so the
08:57 - clear function here is a function that
09:00 - clears the canvas leaving it transparent
09:02 - so in other words I could do something
09:04 - like this where it's like you know oh
09:06 - I'm gonna add a little smiley on to the
09:08 - unicorn and give it like some wings and
09:11 - oh and then oh mouse press clears it I
09:15 - didn't even realize that so I could
09:17 - instead say like keep rest or something
09:20 - because I want to be able to draw a well
09:22 - you get the point I want to like augment
09:24 - this unicorn by giving it I don't know
09:27 - what I'm drawing now and then in case
09:28 - the spacebar and I could clear it so
09:30 - this is a possible these are a couple
09:32 - possible creative applications of
09:34 - combining canvas and drawing with
09:37 - existing web content
09:38 - what is that existing web content is in
09:41 - a page you've made is it something on
09:42 - your blog is it some is it like
09:44 - newspaper website and through a Chrome
09:46 - extension you're gonna modify there's a
09:48 - lot of possibilities here that I'll
09:49 - hopefully show you in future videos but
09:52 - hopefully this video I've at least shown
09:53 - you some tricks for how to use p5.js as
09:57 - a background for a web page and by that
09:59 - I really mean a canvas sitting there as
10:01 - the background of the web page okay
10:03 - thanks for watching you can ask your
10:05 - questions in the comments or ask me at
10:07 - Schiffman on twitter and i will see you
10:09 - in a future video thanks
10:19 - you
