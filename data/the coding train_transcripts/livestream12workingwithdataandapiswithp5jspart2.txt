00:00 - hitting another live stream today hello
00:03 - um my lips feel a little bit chapped
00:06 - that's not a good sign I do have some
00:08 - water though I don't know if anyone is
00:10 - here so okay so what's happening in this
00:13 - particular live stream I did something
00:15 - crazy which types gonna tweet about it
00:17 - and I promoted that tweet see if that
00:19 - like does anything like if random people
00:21 - join just to see if I can get a little
00:23 - more audience audience in here uh so um
00:29 - why I could see the stream actually just
00:31 - started it takes a while to get going
00:33 - and just started with me drinking my
00:34 - water ah somebody is here excellent
00:36 - hello okay so I have got this YouTube
00:40 - channel and I've been making a lot of
00:42 - videos about processing this thing
00:44 - called processing is JavaScript
00:46 - programming with a framework of library
00:48 - called pjs and I started a series a
00:52 - playlist about working with data and in
00:54 - the last example I got to let me because
00:58 - I I couldn't actually prepare anything
01:01 - so this is my be doing my preparation Oh
01:03 - a newer I want to get the new editor but
01:06 - I'm not going to worry about that the
01:07 - second in the last example that I worked
01:10 - on in the last video I looked at how you
01:13 - could query open weather map the API and
01:17 - look for data from that API pull out
01:20 - pieces of data and draw something on the
01:21 - screen so i have my list of videos that
01:24 - i intend to make and I'm here getting
01:30 - json from an API with a query so what I
01:33 - want to do in this particular video the
01:34 - green screens a little bit fuzzy today
01:35 - but what I want to do in the first video
01:38 - so hey I'm live streaming right now but
01:41 - a while I'm the live stream it would hit
01:42 - record a few times and record these
01:43 - video chunks that will upload later as a
01:46 - standalone tutorials and so in the first
01:48 - one when I think that I would I think
01:50 - what it will make sense to do is to take
01:52 - this particular example and look at how
01:54 - I could have a user type in a city and
01:58 - then have that then have the API queried
02:01 - with that particular city or perhaps
02:03 - have a user pick a city from you know
02:05 - like a drop down menu or
02:06 - that sort of thing so that is my plan so
02:12 - first I would like to know actually
02:13 - before I put does anybody have can you
02:15 - hear me okay can you see this okay and
02:18 - if I come over here is this in-focus
02:21 - enough that you can make out what I drew
02:24 - here I'm gonna go look over here and see
02:26 - mm-hmm it's a little bit light but cut
02:29 - let me know can you read this I think
02:31 - it's this pen yeah you look at this that
02:35 - looks pretty good so let me know if the
02:37 - sound the picture all of that is ok so
02:40 - that I don't start going on and on and
02:42 - on with you can't hear or see all good
02:44 - thank you hi Jerome is here p5 art hello
02:48 - welcome nice to see you on the
02:50 - livestream nice to have a bunch of
02:52 - people here I'm excited okay I'm like a
02:54 - low energy today I got it got to do
02:56 - something about that ah how to get a
03:00 - higher energy but I'm seeing people say
03:02 - stuff in the chat is always good okay um
03:04 - so does anybody have any questions
03:06 - anything you want to ask uh anything
03:08 - you're not sure about let me know before
03:11 - i get started i think i'm actually ready
03:13 - to go with this particular example okay
03:19 - i'm going to drink some more water here
03:24 - my video settings got a little bit
03:26 - messed up but i only have i have about
03:29 - an hour or a little bit less i have
03:32 - about an hour so rather than if I sure
03:34 - trying to fix these green screen
03:35 - settings i'll be here for like a half an
03:37 - hour so let me just um fix this wire
03:42 - make sure my hair looks okay oh yes my
03:45 - hair looks excellent that's really the
03:47 - thing it spent a lot of time this
03:48 - morning making you know trimming and
03:50 - laughing and all that kind of stuff to
03:53 - get ready to talk about because you know
03:54 - you have to look good when you're
03:55 - talking about api's right okay I gotta
03:59 - get started I'm stalling eight people
04:01 - here that's nice I've got so I'm going
04:05 - to put this down and I'm going to delete
04:11 - these and let me get this in a good
04:15 - place here
04:18 - let me minimize this its stop and move
04:23 - this over so I'm here and then when i
04:26 - run this this shows up over here let me
04:30 - give a little more space just organizing
04:31 - my desktop here I see why I moved it
04:33 - over I'm going to I'm going to change
04:37 - something about this example real quick
04:39 - to make it a little bit so for is this
04:41 - font size okay if you're watching the
04:42 - live stream is this font size okay
04:44 - should I make it bigger smaller
05:01 - and I'm just fixing this example a
05:03 - little bit to make it a little bit
05:08 - better to start from and I'm going to
05:14 - take this whole thing and put it in a
05:22 - variable and say this okay about to get
05:32 - ready i'm going to check the chat
05:34 - sponsor may be a tad bigger okay i'm
05:38 - going to make that a tad bigger make it
05:42 - how to try 36-point think this probably
05:47 - is good let me know if you think it
05:49 - needs to be even bigger still okay sort
05:53 - of a trade-off of getting more code on
05:54 - the screen but getting also having it be
05:58 - more legible okay here we go oh the
06:01 - jackhammering is started outside that's
06:03 - not good I can have to close the window
06:04 - I like to have the window open sunlight
06:06 - coming in to breeze through my hair cuz
06:09 - you got to talk about cole I can feel
06:10 - like nature outside with you but sadly I
06:15 - don't want you to have to listen to life
06:16 - on jackhammering let's see good like
06:19 - that excellent okay here we go I'm going
06:22 - to start with the first video let me
06:24 - cycle the camera because these cameras
06:27 - have a thing where they turn off after
06:29 - 30 minutes I move this backpack so I
06:33 - don't trip over it cycle this camera and
06:37 - ready got an a pen and an eraser some
06:42 - water it's 10 a.m. it's the morning I'm
06:46 - full of energy all I wanted to do all I
06:49 - didn't want to do it welcome to this
06:50 - morning I said how I wouldn't do is make
06:51 - videos attack the thing is that's
06:56 - actually true that's how I feel I enjoy
06:59 - us okay here we go one two three in this
07:06 - video I start over let me just check the
07:09 - chat everything nobody's saying anything
07:11 - okay
07:12 - I think one thing I need to do a better
07:14 - job of i think is at the beginning just
07:16 - saying what the video is going to be
07:18 - because I kind of do this like wandering
07:20 - rambling thing which you know i think
07:22 - you know doesn't really work if you're
07:24 - kind of just quickly coming in to try to
07:26 - figure out what you're watching so okay
07:31 - all right here we go
07:35 - in this video what I want to look at is
07:37 - how you can take user input from a user
07:40 - and pass that user input to an API query
07:44 - get some data have that data come back
07:46 - into your program and visualize
07:47 - something on the screen so this is a
07:50 - that I built in the previous video which
07:53 - I'll link to below and what this example
07:55 - is doing is it's querying an API called
07:58 - open weather map it's sending a city the
08:01 - city that it's sending you can see right
08:02 - there is London and then it gets back
08:05 - some data about London what's the
08:07 - current temperature what's the current
08:08 - humidity and in this example I'm pulling
08:11 - that data out into two variables and
08:13 - drawing two circles on the screen so
08:14 - first I gotta admit something which is
08:16 - that this is like a perhaps the least
08:18 - visually interesting you know data
08:20 - visualization I you know anybody ever
08:23 - has ever done so I'm making I don't have
08:26 - I don't have a visual bone so I'm but
08:30 - I'm demonstrating the technique so what
08:32 - you would do hopefully with my with this
08:34 - technique is thinking of a new way of
08:36 - presenting information by weather or
08:38 - doing some type of animation there's
08:39 - lots of possibilities but what i want to
08:42 - show you here is no matter how many
08:44 - times i run this it's always just going
08:47 - to query the API boom as soon as the
08:49 - program starts and then it's going to
08:51 - get that weather from London and it's
08:52 - never to query the API again so how do
08:55 - we make something that when the user
08:57 - enters a city that we get that well that
09:02 - then week where the API show the
09:04 - information the user can then enter
09:06 - another city we get that information
09:07 - Corey the API again so how could we have
09:10 - query the API over time while the
09:12 - program is running how do we think about
09:13 - as a sequence of events and how do we
09:15 - tie that to drawing we beating me right
09:17 - now and then you I got this thing about
09:20 - pronouns it's really like a problem as
09:22 - in my head all the time I could only
09:23 - think about what program i use what's
09:24 - that but i'll link to something in the
09:27 - description below about why i think
09:28 - about that all the time okay so let's
09:30 - make that happen so first of all I need
09:32 - somewhere to get user input so right now
09:34 - what this actually is a web page just
09:36 - with this canvas on it so what I would
09:37 - like to do is add to the webpage
09:39 - something where the user could
09:41 - type in some type in the city so guess
09:44 - what i'm going to add there's an HTML
09:47 - page associated with this javascript
09:49 - code it's the it's the page that's
09:50 - loading this code so i'm going to go
09:52 - there first so in this p 5 j s editor
09:54 - i'm going to hit the Settings button and
09:57 - say show sidebar and there's a bunch of
09:59 - extra stuff in here that are not using
10:00 - because this was built and I'm going to
10:02 - go to this index.html file and now in
10:06 - the HTML body what I want to do is add
10:10 - paragraph and then I'm going to add an
10:12 - input can you see this i'm going to add
10:14 - an input field and i'm going to give it
10:20 - an ID will call it city and i'll put
10:25 - london in there and i'll say city colon
10:28 - so now what i've added is just some HTML
10:30 - that on the page I want to see a field
10:34 - that a user could type something into
10:36 - and we run this you can see there it is
10:39 - oops and by the way so i did that
10:41 - incorrectly look at this so what I
10:43 - wanted to do if we look back at that
10:46 - window this is this was going so well
10:49 - until I got confused like look what's
10:50 - here what I wanted to do is I wanted to
10:53 - have the word London populate that sit
10:56 - that that text input field automatically
10:59 - and I thought I don't know how to do
11:00 - this but it must it's sometimes it works
11:02 - this way I could just create this HTML
11:05 - input element and put London in the
11:06 - middle but I forgot that the text that
11:09 - is in the text input element is actually
11:12 - its value value being an attribute of
11:15 - this HTML element so if I want to do
11:17 - that I just need to say value equals
11:20 - London so now if I fix that and let me
11:23 - make this a little bit wider so you can
11:25 - kind of see it and I run this again you
11:27 - can see there we go so I now have this
11:30 - text input box at the top with the word
11:33 - London in it ok we're getting somewhere
11:36 - now maybe I should also add very briefly
11:38 - i'll put like a line break and then I'm
11:41 - going to add a button with an ID called
11:44 - submit and I'll say submit so now I've
11:48 - also added an HTML element a button so i
11:52 - have a text input element
11:55 - pre populated with London and I have a
11:56 - button so when I press that button I'm
11:58 - going to ask the API to give me the
12:00 - weather for whatever city is in that
12:02 - field excellent okay so let's look at
12:05 - this run this you can see there we go
12:07 - now I could do a better job like styling
12:09 - this and putting line breaks in and that
12:11 - sort of thing but the point here is that
12:12 - I could do this and then I could type
12:13 - New York and I want to see what what's
12:16 - in the canvas what's in the drawing
12:18 - change based on that current weather so
12:21 - how do we do that I'm excited you
12:24 - excited if I don't know you shouldn't be
12:26 - as excited to be I'm a little bit
12:28 - excitable it's a bit of a problem
12:29 - because me a lot of anxiety in life but
12:31 - I'm but but I'm doing well today and I'm
12:33 - happy to talk about this with you okay
12:34 - so let's look first to answer this
12:37 - question we have to look at something we
12:39 - have to look at this URL look at this
12:41 - URL it's a long thing I figured it out
12:43 - in the last video that i got i have a
12:45 - path to the API I have some whether i
12:48 - have a question mark u equals london
12:50 - that's the city app ID that's my API key
12:53 - units equal metric that's giving me the
12:55 - information in Celsius right so how do
12:59 - we what what do we need to do and to
13:01 - figure this out i'm going to come over
13:02 - here to my trusty friend the whiteboard
13:05 - I trust you friend looking forward and
13:07 - um let's think about this URL so most
13:11 - api's and you're making a AP i query
13:14 - it's very similar to type in a URL into
13:17 - the browser in fact if i pasted that URL
13:19 - into the browser we're going to see the
13:20 - data associated with it I kind of I kind
13:22 - of wish i was doing that right now let's
13:24 - do that for a second I come back to the
13:25 - whiteboard right so let me go over here
13:28 - and i'm going to copy this whole thing
13:31 - i'm going to go into chrome and i'm
13:34 - going to paste it in up here and i'm
13:36 - going to look and see you look here's
13:37 - the data coming in and you can see that
13:39 - up here is the city so even if I just in
13:43 - the brow up here if I just change that
13:45 - to New York for example you can see aha
13:49 - now I have the weather associated with
13:51 - New York which the temperature about you
13:54 - know 18 degrees Celsius that's of all
13:56 - right it's actually quite a beautiful
13:57 - day sun shining eyes wide inside talking
14:01 - to a camera all by myself this I think
14:02 - the same stupid joke in all my videos
14:04 - about I'm talking to
14:05 - we're by myself but it is true okay so
14:08 - that's what I'm doing ok so now you can
14:11 - see the way that you could get a
14:13 - different city you know I could now I
14:15 - could overhear I could type Tokyo and
14:17 - I'm gonna get the weather for Tokyo the
14:18 - way that I get the data from a different
14:21 - city is to change the url so somehow I'm
14:25 - able to do that manually in the browser
14:27 - somehow I need to figure out a way of
14:29 - doing that in code and the reason why I
14:32 - was coming over here is oops what was I
14:35 - not know I was here was I in the right
14:38 - place the whole time missing London
14:39 - aren't ya I'm sorry tell me him the chat
14:42 - hopefully I record i'll have to fix this
14:43 - video if i know huh this is like Charlie
14:47 - Chaplin me I could have someone
14:50 - plate-like down with this edit this and
14:51 - add some like music to it um yeah I'm
14:55 - not like Charlie cha wish i was like
14:56 - Charlie Chaplin that'd be good um ok so
15:00 - all right so how do we do this huh I
15:02 - don't know this video's I kind of want
15:04 - to re-record this video but um so in my
15:07 - code there is a URL and it's one long
15:11 - string it starts with like HTTP it has
15:16 - like open weather map blah blah blah
15:18 - blah blah blah so somehow we have to
15:20 - figure out the way that to do this is to
15:23 - piece together the URL from its
15:26 - components one of which happens to be
15:29 - dynamic that's that's happening with
15:31 - input from the user so for example one
15:33 - way that I could think about doing this
15:35 - is I could say var API equals HTTP colon
15:41 - slash slash open weather map org slash
15:45 - weather ? so like this is the beginning
15:50 - of the API query then I might have
15:55 - another variable called like city which
15:58 - I say these are strings which I say is
16:01 - London then I might have another
16:04 - variable where I say something like API
16:06 - key equals you know my crazy API key and
16:10 - then when I want to make the actual URL
16:13 - which is the actual URL that i will send
16:16 - to the API then all you do is say I want
16:20 - to have the API plus the city plus the
16:27 - API key right remember the plus symbol
16:30 - with text right two plus two equals four
16:33 - but the string 2 plus the string to what
16:36 - this is actually a valid use of air
16:38 - quotes by the way you usually
16:39 - everybody's just kind of an obnoxious
16:40 - thing in general but I feel like if
16:42 - you're trying to indicate a string like
16:44 - this is like a time in my life where I'm
16:45 - allowed to use air now I feel ridiculous
16:47 - but um this to the two in quotes plus 2
16:51 - in quotes is 22 right two plus two is 22
16:57 - not 22 but 22 so what this is 22 like
17:00 - like I think that you wear when you're
17:01 - doing ballet um so this I'm trying
17:05 - trying much too hard to be interesting
17:08 - i'm talking about this it's not going
17:10 - well it feels forced today so this so
17:15 - this is the way that you can put
17:16 - together the pieces of an api call in as
17:21 - a as in your hell by having them in
17:24 - components the whole reason I'm talking
17:25 - about this is because now this one can
17:27 - be dynamic so if city is not a hard
17:30 - coded value it's coming from the user
17:32 - and every time I want to query the API
17:33 - this always stays the same this always
17:35 - stays the same this is the thing that
17:37 - changes so let's go see if we can add
17:39 - that to the code and make this work I'm
17:42 - over here now okay so coming back to the
17:45 - program let me minimize this coming back
17:48 - to the program we can look now at the
17:51 - components of this URL so let's say what
17:54 - I want is all the way up to here is
17:56 - going to be kind of like the first part
17:57 - so I'm just going to call this the API
18:00 - and maybe i'll call like api path so
18:02 - it's sort of like the path or the API
18:03 - let's just call it API then I'm going to
18:06 - make a variable called city and I'm
18:08 - going to make that London then I'm going
18:11 - to make a variable called like API key
18:14 - and it's going to be this whole thing
18:19 - and then I'm going to make a variable
18:21 - ups and then I'm going to make a
18:22 - variable called
18:27 - units and add this so you can see now
18:32 - and I I think if I think if I make this
18:34 - a little bit wide unfortunately like
18:36 - it's sort of hard to fit everything ha
18:37 - but now I've got it I've got it you can
18:39 - see nann what do I have some I have some
18:41 - like weird warnings here missing a
18:42 - semicolon somewhere I see my semi oh you
18:47 - know what i did is i used a double quote
18:48 - and a single quote that'll fix things up
18:50 - okay so you can see now that I broke the
18:53 - API call into its parts so all of these
18:56 - things all of these things are are not
19:00 - going to the api api key and units are
19:02 - not going to change i always want to
19:04 - query open weather map I always wanted
19:05 - in metric and I always have this API key
19:07 - now of course your scenario might be
19:09 - different but for this particular
19:10 - scenario the only thing that changes is
19:12 - the city and so now when I want to load
19:17 - the data i would say VAR URL equals API
19:21 - + city plus API key + units and now we
19:26 - can see let's see let's just make sure
19:27 - this still works as before it still
19:29 - works as before so instead of having the
19:32 - full API call is one long string I now
19:34 - have it in pieces and we could see if I
19:36 - change this to do New York now I'm
19:40 - seeing the New York whether you're just
19:41 - gonna have to trust that that's kind of
19:43 - the right values again because this is
19:44 - my pathetic little I'm just drawing the
19:46 - temperature and the humidity as circles
19:48 - on the screen okay so we're getting
19:50 - somewhere though because now I can move
19:53 - this right I can I don't this this API
19:57 - call is happening in set up only in set
20:00 - up where do I want it to happen now if
20:02 - we look at this web page that I've made
20:06 - I want that API call to happen when I
20:09 - click the submit button so how do I make
20:11 - that happen I need two steps one I need
20:14 - access to that Dom element I need to
20:16 - select that Dom element then I also need
20:19 - to attach a mousepressed event to that
20:21 - Dom element so let's add those two
20:23 - things to this program i'm going to say
20:28 - oops whoopsie a bar button equals select
20:33 - submit so if you remember in the HTML
20:36 - page the button
20:38 - an ID submit so the ID is a way that I
20:42 - can select that element in my code and
20:44 - do things to it so now in my coat as
20:47 - long as I select by the buttons ID
20:50 - submit I can now say button dot
20:54 - mousepressed ask for but I don't like
20:59 - ask you know whether whether ask I don't
21:03 - know think of a better I'm so bad at
21:05 - functioning do you think of a better
21:06 - functioning me but the event that i want
21:08 - is whether ask so now i can take this
21:10 - and i can write a function called
21:13 - weather ask and i can paste that in
21:18 - there and whoops i need two parentheses
21:22 - and by the way I'm kind of standing in
21:25 - front of my code which is the thing that
21:26 - always happens so if I move this over
21:29 - that'll help you so now right I selected
21:32 - the button when i press the button call
21:34 - whether asked when i call whether ask
21:36 - ask for the weather based on this URL
21:38 - that i've made of all these components
21:40 - from the API call now run this and every
21:44 - time I hit I hit submit I get that
21:45 - weather now notice every time I hit
21:47 - submit it's the same thing why because
21:50 - city is still hard coded as New York but
21:53 - now we could do something really
21:55 - exciting that's just a variable right
21:57 - why not get the value of what this text
22:02 - input field why not get what's in that
22:04 - text input field and store that in that
22:07 - particular variable this is going to
22:09 - make things really really great ok so
22:12 - here we go so first of all I need a I
22:15 - need a variable called input and I need
22:18 - to also select that input input equals
22:20 - select now I don't remember what id I
22:22 - gave it I gave it an ID city so now i
22:26 - need to say select city and then what am
22:30 - I doing here I'm instead of this instead
22:33 - of city being hard coded as New York I
22:37 - can overwrite you know actually don't
22:39 - even need this variable anymore honestly
22:41 - because we don't want a hard code the
22:43 - city so i can take that out and actually
22:45 - instead of i could make it a separate
22:47 - variable but all i need to do now is put
22:49 - in put not value
22:50 - here oops so right because I've gotten
22:53 - that text input element there I can get
22:56 - the value and add that to my API call so
22:59 - again the path to the API doesn't change
23:01 - my API key doesn't change I always
23:03 - wanted in metric units but I want the
23:07 - city that piece of it to be from that
23:09 - text input field and here we go it's
23:13 - running like to see it submit and I've
23:15 - got London and let's try some other
23:17 - cities like Tokyo Los Angeles you can
23:25 - see oh it's not very humid in los
23:27 - angeles new york toronto right okay so
23:34 - you get it it works oh it's great that
23:35 - it works so this is a this is a nice
23:38 - thing to practice with api's I mean this
23:40 - is kind of one so obvious way of doing
23:43 - things you take some from the you take
23:45 - some information from the user you send
23:47 - that to the API you get some data back
23:48 - you display the data back to the user so
23:51 - I might suggest you know what else could
23:52 - you imagine here could you could you
23:54 - create a checkbox and whether the
23:56 - checkbox is checked you would when it's
23:58 - checked you would get Celsius when it's
23:59 - unchecked you would get Fahrenheit so
24:01 - could you that would be one thing to try
24:03 - to add to this as an exercise I think if
24:05 - you're looking for like a technical
24:06 - exercise to do you know mostly I would
24:08 - say get what true data is in there what
24:10 - kind of more interesting way can you
24:11 - just play the data if it's raining can
24:12 - you make it rain in the canvas you know
24:14 - live again these are kind of like
24:16 - obvious literal visual representations
24:20 - of the data but I think you might be
24:21 - also be able to think more creatively
24:22 - and what I would like to do now I think
24:26 - that kind of covers the whole basis
24:27 - there's actually a there's a missing
24:29 - piece here i just realized which is that
24:31 - so we've done two things one week where
24:33 - the api the moment the program runs and
24:35 - then we're done now we've done the
24:36 - second thing any time the user performs
24:39 - an action like pressing a button we
24:41 - query the api and we get data back a
24:42 - third thing would be have the program
24:45 - automatically query the api every so
24:47 - often and this is something you want to
24:48 - do if you have data that's changing a
24:50 - lot and there's anything there's an
24:52 - example of an API that gives you the
24:54 - latitude longitude of the International
24:56 - Space Station where it is sort of above
24:58 - the earth and so that's an API that the
25:00 - space station is moving
25:01 - think continuously that you get
25:03 - different data all the time so I would
25:04 - also like to do it maybe I'll do that in
25:06 - the next videos look at how you query an
25:08 - API you know over how do you set like to
25:10 - do it every 100 milliseconds or every
25:12 - one second or every 30 seconds just have
25:14 - that happen in the background while an
25:15 - animation is continuing so I'll take a
25:18 - look at that in the next video and the
25:20 - other things i want to do in some these
25:21 - future visions just look at other api's
25:22 - New York Times is on my list word nick
25:24 - is on my list that sort of thing so
25:25 - let's see this isn't being like a very
25:27 - long video it was like so short for a
25:28 - while but I had this like section in the
25:30 - middle where I just like I wasn't sure
25:32 - if I was in the right place and I
25:33 - started like rambling about wearing a
25:34 - tutu if you're still watching this video
25:36 - right now you know hashtag shipment 22
25:39 - or something to let me know you weren't
25:40 - watching because no one's going to be at
25:42 - 18 minutes in this video I swear okay I
25:44 - think that's a thing that maybe I'll do
25:46 - at the end of a hashtag Schiffman air
25:50 - quotes i think i need to put shipment in
25:51 - there oh then maybe air just stop
25:53 - watching all right ago it's a butyl
25:54 - hopefully you live somewhere where it's
25:55 - a beautiful day and even it's not a
25:57 - beautiful day being outside is nice okay
26:00 - like the mouse even my mouse went to
26:02 - sleep even that's how long i've been
26:04 - recording this video okay okay let me
26:07 - check the live stream okay um all right
26:15 - okay there's 13 people here now um so
26:21 - hopefully that did that make any sense I
26:23 - think that I sort of k i'm gonna open
26:25 - the window for a second to get some air
26:27 - it so i don't if you can't hear that
26:29 - jackhammer is that showing up on the
26:31 - audio so i think actually i think i will
26:33 - go on in the next video it's only 10 20
26:36 - no so I have another 40 minutes i think
26:37 - i think i will do an example where I
26:40 - query that space station API over over
26:43 - somebody suggested to me on Twitter
26:44 - which was super nice of them I can't
26:47 - remember who it was but let's see so ISS
26:50 - latitude longitude open notify so this
26:56 - is an API let's look at this oh you know
27:01 - this brings up another thing which is
27:03 - okay this is an API where I'm getting
27:07 - continuously the latitude and longitude
27:09 - now I just realized there's a component
27:13 - that so I wouldn't want to draw
27:14 - something on this
27:14 - Green based on this latitude and
27:16 - longitude if I hit refresh you know it's
27:19 - changing pretty often it's not by a lot
27:21 - but it's changing what I want to do is
27:22 - make something move on the screen
27:23 - according to this latitude and longitude
27:25 - and the know Joe you don't hear the
27:30 - jackhammer that's good so you know this
27:36 - brings up a whole question like how do
27:37 - you convert latitude longitude to XY
27:40 - coordinates which is a tricky problem
27:45 - because the earth is a sphere and
27:47 - spherical man and if you flatten it to
27:50 - like a pixel space there's some math
27:52 - involved so but I'm going to ignore that
27:58 - problem I think for the purpose of this
27:59 - video and just do like a simple map map
28:02 - map not like Mac but as in the math
28:04 - function like map to it's an x and y so
28:07 - what's a range what's the range what is
28:11 - the range for latitude I should look
28:15 - this up in advance latitudes measure
28:17 - from zero to negative plus mining 90
28:20 - longitude members the Prime Meridian
28:22 - which runs through Greenwich I was just
28:25 - recently standing there in Greenwich and
28:27 - longitude measures from 0 to plus or
28:29 - minus 180 so latitude 0 to plus or minus
28:34 - 90 longitude does that make that George
28:37 - eyes with this latitude 0 ok so I can
28:39 - use that to do the mapping to map the
28:42 - negative 182 plus 182 0 2 with or its 02
28:46 - height and latitude right latitude would
28:48 - be X longitude would be why you're by
28:51 - making any sense oh you can hear the
28:54 - jackhammer some of you can hear at some
28:55 - of you can't i'm going to close the
28:56 - window before i start the sort of more
28:58 - official i guess i should just close it
28:59 - now um it just gets a little hot in here
29:02 - ok so anybody have any questions or
29:06 - concerns or i have this desire to just
29:12 - pour this on my head the live streaming
29:15 - about data plain water that's not very
29:18 - cold challenge is what I'm thinking of
29:20 - doing here
29:21 - not going to do that if it would raise
29:23 - money for a good cause maybe I would ok
29:27 - so i think i'm ready to do this I'm just
29:29 - going to actually start it from scratch
29:31 - let me get a p5 sketch set up save as a
29:38 - ISS animation save and actually let me
29:45 - clear this let me I'm just going to add
29:49 - some code in advance before I start
29:51 - recording I mean I am work this is being
29:53 - recorded but and I'm going to make a
29:57 - canvas which is a 600 x 400 to make it a
30:03 - little bit bigger a background 51 and
30:07 - I'm just going to put an animation on
30:09 - let's have a variable line x equals 0
30:14 - just so we see that it's continuously
30:16 - animating line x + 1 that's fine plus 5
30:26 - and if line x is greater than with line
30:31 - x equals 0 ominous and then i'm going to
30:34 - draw a line from line x 0 line x height
30:39 - I just want to have something
30:40 - continuously i guess i need to give that
30:43 - a stroke that so you can see it I want
30:46 - to have something continuously animating
30:48 - because i want to emphasize oh it still
30:50 - has all that stuff in the HTML which i'm
30:52 - going to take out now and let's just get
30:55 - rid of this i want to have something
30:56 - that's animating because i want to
30:59 - emphasize that even while you're making
31:02 - the API query and waiting for the data
31:05 - to come back that's happening
31:06 - asynchronously meeting the draw loop can
31:09 - still continue and it's interesting i
31:12 - think to note that this is sort of
31:13 - native to the way javascript works
31:15 - previous videos where I might have
31:17 - demonstrated something similar using
31:18 - processing your native to the way
31:20 - processing in Java works is everything
31:22 - is synchronous like if you ask for the
31:24 - data the next line of code is not
31:25 - happening until that data comes back but
31:28 - here we're going to be all say just
31:29 - start that process of asking for the
31:30 - data
31:30 - doing this when the data comes back
31:31 - update this other thing you're drawing
31:33 - so that's what I'm going to do here and
31:36 - I you know I haven't made this example
31:37 - before I really should probably make it
31:39 - and then make the video but I'm just
31:40 - going to go for it and I think there's
31:43 - two ways of doing this one is I could in
31:45 - draw every once in a while query for the
31:47 - data or this might be a nice opportunity
31:50 - to talk about set timeout or set
31:52 - interval why not right why not talk
31:55 - about that in this video I think it's
31:57 - sort of worth it I mentioned what I'm
31:59 - talking about in the video ok anybody
32:01 - have any comments or questions before I
32:02 - get started let me cycle the cameras and
32:11 - recycle this one and I'm going to erase
32:15 - the whiteboard over here ok edited it at
32:26 - this it did it I like to the song it's
32:29 - always in my head is where is thumbkin
32:32 - my son plays it on the piano every
32:34 - morning to wake us all up it's very
32:37 - actually really sweet e 7 ok ah Jack
32:44 - over here you guys aren't saying
32:48 - anything in the chat which I find to be
32:49 - disconcerting is this still happening is
32:52 - anybody I have let's see yet all right
32:58 - come watch Schiffman live people are
33:00 - tweeting about this that's exciting even
33:02 - though there's only 10 people here ok
33:04 - here we go let's talk about the
33:06 - International Space Station ok
33:14 - let's start over here oh and this is
33:19 - call this is s and close this and here
33:24 - we are and this can be now sorry
33:26 - everybody I'm just getting myself set up
33:28 - here and here we go and three the lights
33:35 - are still on yeah you can still hear me
33:36 - I me old ice change the battery in one
33:39 - mic I just want to make sure i change
33:40 - this one's okay this guy I've got two
33:41 - bars okay good here we go hello in this
33:50 - video I'm going to look at how you query
33:53 - an API continuously while a program is
33:56 - running a program that's perhaps
33:57 - animating something and that animation
33:59 - doesn't stop it continues smoothly but
34:02 - updates whenever new data comes in boys
34:06 - meant exciting topic you woke up this
34:08 - morning and thought I want to watch a
34:09 - video about how you query an API
34:11 - continuously while an animation is
34:12 - happening right okay so um that's what I
34:15 - woke up thinking I was gonna do is make
34:17 - a video about that actually I just
34:18 - thought of this a few minutes ago so I
34:19 - didn't really wake up thinking about it
34:21 - but let's just get started so this by
34:22 - the way is a program that I've set up in
34:24 - advance just to have like a simple
34:26 - animation on the screen nothing too
34:27 - exciting this line is moving across
34:28 - there's a single variable for the line
34:30 - the line is incrementing by five pixels
34:32 - when it gets the end it starts back at
34:33 - zero so we can see there's any animation
34:35 - now what I need to demonstrate this idea
34:38 - is I needed API that's going to give me
34:40 - data and it's going to give me different
34:42 - data every time I query it so a lot of
34:45 - eight guys don't really do this for
34:47 - example if you ask for the weather
34:48 - you're going to get the temperature
34:50 - outside temperature outside obviously is
34:52 - changing but the weather api probably is
34:53 - only going to update every few minutes
34:56 - you know if you ask for the New York
34:57 - Times do an article search you know
34:59 - there's not going to be a lot of new
35:00 - articles every with a certain word every
35:04 - like few seconds however there is this
35:06 - API called it's under open notified org
35:11 - and it gives you the International Space
35:14 - Station current location and by the way
35:16 - in case you were wondering that's
35:19 - changing it's moving are the earth is
35:21 - spinning I don't know somehow it all
35:22 - works physics ask Stephen Hawking I
35:24 - don't know about this stuff although i
35:25 - did find it fast
35:26 - so what we can look for here is like
35:29 - look here is how here's the URL for
35:31 - getting json data with the latitude and
35:34 - longitude of the International Space
35:35 - Station so I all I need is this
35:38 - particular URL I'm going to copy it I'm
35:40 - going to put it in the web browser to
35:42 - look at that data and we can see there
35:44 - it is the International Space Station
35:46 - position is currently at this particular
35:48 - latitude and this particular longitude
35:50 - hit refresh oh come on change it changed
35:53 - right you can see it's changing each
35:55 - time I hit refresh a little bit but
35:57 - changing what's moving by a fast
35:59 - latitude this is like a this is called
36:00 - the Refresh dance by the way it's good
36:04 - at physical exercises important why I'm
36:06 - standing making these videos I feel like
36:07 - I need to move around more okay so so
36:10 - when you practice api's you know move
36:12 - around where was I um so this is some
36:17 - stuff that I want to get I want to get
36:19 - into my into the program so first let's
36:21 - just let's just get started with that so
36:23 - the first thing I want to do is grab
36:24 - this URL now and inside the program I
36:28 - may be just in set up right now i'm
36:30 - going to say lo JSON and i'm going to
36:33 - say the URL is let's for this particular
36:36 - API and let's just make this a global
36:38 - variable I'm trying to make things that
36:39 - fit in my code nicely VAR URL equals ah
36:43 - bad copy paste job paste that in there
36:47 - so that's the URL for the API query
36:49 - let's make this a little bit wider so
36:52 - now I want to load Jason I'm using the
36:54 - p5 low JSON function which says give me
36:57 - a URL which doesn't say anything
37:00 - actually but the thing you can give to
37:01 - it is a URL where you'd get some JSON
37:03 - and then a call back so I'm going to
37:07 - call the callback got data so this
37:09 - function will be executed when the data
37:11 - has come back so i'm going to say
37:13 - function i'm going to write that
37:14 - function got data the argument the
37:18 - parameter of that function which i
37:19 - happen to be calling data you can call
37:21 - it anything you want like a manatee the
37:24 - the the parameter data is what's going
37:28 - to get filled with the json that's
37:30 - coming from that URL so you know just
37:33 - quickly if I just said print line data
37:35 - we'd be able to see very easily that
37:37 - whoops
37:39 - okay ah so remember this thing I talked
37:42 - about this in a previous video boy I
37:43 - hope this works sometimes it doesn't
37:45 - work sometimes it doesn't work because
37:47 - of security issues with how information
37:50 - is passed between different servers and
37:52 - open notified at org is a different
37:54 - server and if you just add some padding
37:56 - so this thing called JSON p this if you
38:02 - add a third argument JSON pipe maybe I
38:04 - something I'll make a video just what is
38:05 - this JSON p thing it's telling p5 behind
38:09 - the scenes to use this other way of
38:11 - getting the data that kind of passes
38:13 - security so hopefully now when I run
38:15 - this sketch we can see in there it is
38:17 - now you can see the data showed up down
38:19 - here in the console I've got that data
38:21 - so looking at this remember the next
38:23 - thing that we need to do is figure out
38:24 - how do i get the latitude how do i get
38:26 - the longitude well javascript object
38:29 - notation is the way that I do this this
38:30 - whole thing is an object and I want to
38:32 - get the first property is s position and
38:35 - then I want to get the first property of
38:38 - ISS position latitude I want to get the
38:40 - second property bias position longitude
38:42 - and by the way I said first and second
38:43 - in objects the order doesn't actually
38:45 - matter it's not like an array where you
38:47 - would be referencing from the index you
38:48 - may rub your you you be i'll be i am no
38:52 - no it's I've it anymore present past
38:55 - future perfect something like that but
38:56 - I'm going to in a moment on the computer
38:59 - type in data dot ISS position dot
39:03 - latitude that's how I Traverse into this
39:04 - JSON data okay so back here I'm now
39:08 - going to say print line just to make
39:10 - sure this is working print line data is
39:13 - s position dot latitude what rhymes with
39:17 - latitude fortitude I don't know okay and
39:21 - you can see there it is beautiful so
39:23 - let's think about what I might do now
39:25 - hmm with that data what's what might I
39:28 - do ok well let that want to draw the
39:30 - space station on the screen in my space
39:32 - station again from the person with no
39:34 - visual talent will be a circle so let's
39:37 - let's do a let's make a variable called
39:40 - is SX is sy because I want to make
39:44 - variables that are impossible to
39:45 - pronounce and in got data I'm just going
39:48 - to say is sx
39:51 - equals the latitude and ISS y equals the
39:58 - say it with me now be like I'm mister
40:01 - mister rogers longitude can you say
40:04 - longitude it would be an that's a good
40:08 - thing to aspire to to be mr. Rogers um
40:09 - so I can put those in those variables
40:12 - and let's give those variables some
40:13 - default values just to start and then
40:16 - let's in our program it's art I feel
40:19 - like this belongs to you and me this
40:20 - programs so i could say our program i'm
40:24 - going to draw the International Space
40:26 - Station and now i'm going to say Phil 2
40:29 - 55 here we go and where is it hmm I
40:34 - don't see that international space
40:35 - station why don't I see that
40:37 - International Space Station what data am
40:38 - I getting fifty- 95 well if I draw
40:43 - something at the pixel x equals 50 and
40:45 - the pixel x equals y equals negative 95
40:48 - that's where 50 / that's way off the
40:51 - screen so this brings up an interesting
40:53 - question I have a latitude and longitude
40:57 - I have that's real world measurement
41:00 - data of where the ISS actually is above
41:02 - the earth in the unit's latitude and
41:04 - longitude but this thing that I'm
41:06 - drawing in a window is pixels it's
41:07 - two-dimensional it's got an x-axis got a
41:09 - y-axis 00 at the top left corner so I
41:12 - somehow need to translate latitude and
41:15 - longitude to x and y now a topic for
41:18 - another video might be how to do that
41:20 - using you know quote unquote correct i
41:23 - won't use air quotes here but quote
41:25 - unquote correct math right if you take a
41:28 - spear and you flatten it out you need to
41:30 - do some sort of like spherical
41:31 - transformation of those spherical
41:33 - coordinates to where they are in a 2d
41:35 - plane but you know sometimes in life
41:38 - that's too complicated I don't want to
41:41 - worry about that right now it hurts I
41:43 - have like a pain that's like it's in my
41:45 - lower back right now and I just want to
41:47 - like live and easy and friendly life and
41:49 - you know I the way that we could do that
41:50 - is just with the nap function because
41:52 - latitude has a range between negative 90
41:56 - and 90 and longitude has a range between
41:58 - 180 and 180 which one is it well its got
42:01 - it one of these was negative 95 I was
42:02 - right about that so I could just take
42:04 - those ranges and map them from zero to
42:07 - pixel width from zero to pixel height so
42:09 - let's do that so what I really want to
42:12 - do is I'm going to say var lat equals
42:16 - the latitude VAR long equals the
42:18 - longitude and then ISS x equals a map
42:21 - the latitude which goes from negative 92
42:24 - 92 between zero and whiff so if you
42:29 - recall I definitely have a video
42:31 - somewhere all just about this math
42:34 - function what the map function does is
42:36 - it takes a value that has a given range
42:38 - and maps that value to another range by
42:41 - the way you could do that math yourself
42:42 - if you wanted to I know you guys I
42:44 - believe in you it's not that complicated
42:46 - but it's nice to have the map function
42:48 - to handle that for you and I think
42:50 - perhaps in my other video I talked about
42:51 - what the math behind the map function is
42:53 - ok so now if we run this dunk denta look
42:58 - there it is the international space
42:59 - station in about hit refresh come on
43:02 - move you can see it's like moving a
43:04 - little bit very ever so slowly and
43:06 - slightly so you know I probably could do
43:08 - a better job of making this here more
43:10 - intimately interesting but we've got
43:12 - something working here but I I spent all
43:14 - this time I've been talking for nine and
43:16 - a half minutes and I haven't even gotten
43:18 - to just this is just all set up all set
43:21 - up for the real tofu I don't say least
43:25 - mexican sounds weird the real like
43:28 - essence of this video which is now I all
43:30 - I did was query that URL at the
43:32 - beginning and set up and I got the data
43:34 - once I want to just keep getting that
43:35 - data over and over again how do I do
43:37 - that okay so there's a couple
43:39 - possibilities here of how you could do
43:42 - that one thing is i have this draw loop
43:44 - draw remember is looping over and over
43:46 - again for the purpose of the animation
43:48 - so i could figure out a way to just put
43:49 - the low json function and draw like that
43:52 - would be querying the API 60 times per
43:54 - second now that's probably way too often
43:55 - so another way I could do is you some
43:57 - kind of counter and say like every 10
44:00 - times through draw or every 30 times or
44:02 - every 100 times query the API all of
44:04 - those are possible and I encourage you
44:06 - to try doing that on your own as an
44:07 - exercise or put something
44:08 - the comments to say hey can you link to
44:09 - some code that does that I'll be glad to
44:11 - do that but what I want to demonstrate
44:12 - to you in this video is another way of
44:15 - doing it and I will shuffle off shuffle
44:17 - off to Buffalo over here Buffalo and I'm
44:22 - going to do this with a function called
44:24 - set time out and even better yet I think
44:29 - maybe I'll actually do it with a
44:30 - function called set interval these are
44:35 - functions that are part of JavaScript
44:38 - itself in the browser these are not p5
44:40 - functions and what these functions do
44:42 - set timeout says trigger an event once
44:50 - you know at blank time so set timeout
44:55 - says I want you to do this event and I
44:57 - want you to do it three seconds from now
44:59 - set interval is very similar trigger an
45:02 - event over and over every blank time
45:10 - every blank milliseconds time should
45:12 - really save milliseconds at blank
45:13 - milliseconds at blank milliseconds so
45:15 - right the difference is the event is
45:18 - clap right I'm going to say the event is
45:20 - clap so if I say set timeout 3,000
45:23 - what's going to happen is on
45:24 - one-thousand two one-thousand three
45:26 - one-thousand if I say set interval 3,000
45:31 - what's going to happen is one
45:32 - one-thousand two one-thousand three
45:33 - one-thousand what one dozen 2003 so it
45:35 - doesn't one one-thousand two
45:36 - one-thousand three one-thousand rate
45:37 - right it's going to do that at the same
45:39 - interval over and over again so you can
45:40 - ask yourself which one is the one you
45:42 - want for this program I want to ask for
45:44 - the data every so often so i can use set
45:47 - interval now there's some nuance to this
45:49 - there's some reasons why other scenarios
45:51 - you I'd want to use set timeout and once
45:53 - I get the data back just ask her it
45:54 - again that actually could be a good way
45:56 - of doing this but set interval is going
45:57 - to be kind of easiest for us right now
45:59 - so the way that these functions work is
46:01 - you know if I'm using set interval for
46:04 - example set interval and then I'm going
46:07 - to pass in of call back this is the
46:10 - function name of the thing that I want
46:11 - to happen every blank milliseconds so
46:16 - all I need to do is say set interval do
46:18 - this thing every so often let's look at
46:21 - that
46:21 - over here now so in setup I want this to
46:25 - start in setup I want to say set
46:28 - interval ask ISS every what should we do
46:32 - let's just do every second so 1000 so
46:35 - this now looks this line of code says
46:40 - execute some function called ask ISS
46:43 - every 1000 milliseconds and the magic of
46:46 - JavaScript and asynchronous events is I
46:48 - can set that thing up going and it's
46:50 - going to happen on its own but draw down
46:53 - here will also continue so this
46:54 - animation will continue the API calls
46:57 - will be happening when the data is
46:58 - reading that got data functional happen
47:00 - everything that hole how the order of
47:02 - everything will happen will be managed
47:04 - by the magic of JavaScript event-based
47:06 - handling so all I need to do is set up
47:09 - the events I need to say set up this
47:10 - interval and then also do draw at the
47:12 - same time which is what I'm doing in
47:14 - this program so now what goes in this
47:16 - function called ask ISS this low JSON
47:22 - call so I just want to do exactly this
47:25 - load JSON call every 1000 seconds for
47:27 - the rest of time at least while the
47:29 - program is running and we can run this
47:32 - now and you can see there it is come on
47:35 - move dot move I assess to get some speed
47:39 - going so one thing that I might do
47:41 - actually here is change my mapping right
47:44 - this mapping is kind of I was kind of
47:46 - mapping the full latitude longitude of
47:48 - the entire world but we can see here
47:50 - that it's currently at latitude 47 and
47:53 - currently at longitude negative 54 so
47:56 - let's go between 45 and 50 and like
47:59 - negative 55 and 50 so if I change this
48:02 - to be between 45 and 50 and what I say
48:08 - negative 55 and negative 50 I think if I
48:12 - do that we're going to get some oh look
48:15 - there it is it's moving can you see the
48:17 - space station it's that the space
48:19 - station is flying every second now I'm
48:22 - you can see it as a rhythm to it because
48:23 - I'm wearing it every second what I would
48:25 - love to do with this but I've been kind
48:27 - of this video's approaching 15 minutes
48:29 - because I would love to like add a
48:30 - little easing
48:31 - ocean into it so it doesn't just jump to
48:33 - next spot when i get to new spot and
48:34 - sore smoothly moves you can make it sort
48:36 - of feel like it's moving you know i'd
48:37 - also love to put an actual map there to
48:39 - love to do the correct spherical math I
48:41 - said max again without thinking about it
48:43 - usually I do that just because I like
48:46 - saying mats but oh it's leaving goodbye
48:50 - International Space Station so anyway so
48:53 - but i'll leave that review exercise for
48:55 - you guys so what i would say is like
48:56 - give this a try but build exactly the
48:58 - same thing what happens if you do it
49:00 - every 10 milliseconds versus every 3 33
49:03 - thousand milliseconds you know could you
49:05 - make it move move interpolate between
49:07 - those two locations I can't I'm trying
49:09 - to think of other exercises that you
49:10 - could do but play around I'm sure you
49:12 - could be creative and come up with some
49:13 - ideas and hopefully this video helped
49:15 - you learn something today I don't have I
49:18 - don't have anything like to say like
49:20 - Schiffman 22 although I think I just a
49:22 - ship with 22 at the end of every video
49:23 - yeah okay goodbye ah broken mouth now
49:29 - sleeping mouse hashtag sleeping mouse
49:31 - you could say that you can if you watch
49:32 - this video tweet me hashtag sleeping
49:35 - mouth shipments sleeping I I don't know
49:37 - how am I going to keep trying I'm not
49:38 - gonna be able to search for these things
49:39 - never mind okay goodbye okay that was
49:45 - pretty good 1040 now alright Ken here
49:51 - okay how did that make sense to anybody
49:52 - I'm trying to think of oh I didn't I
49:55 - okay so now let me go back to my notes
49:57 - here recorded that one we go back to my
49:59 - notes here what did I do I got so I did
50:05 - open whether soap so the first video
50:08 - number six was getting json from api
50:11 - with a query open weather map number
50:13 - seven was configuring query with user
50:20 - input open weather map number eight was
50:23 - get data continuously with ISS so now
50:29 - here we go this is my list and i'd be
50:31 - curious for what you guys anybody's
50:33 - watching live now thinks i want to do a
50:36 - video with the word nick API the one of
50:38 - the New York Times API I'd love to do a
50:40 - video with some image Bay
50:42 - api and then I want to do a video about
50:46 - word counting and like term frequency a
50:50 - video about working with Google sheets
50:52 - and a video about saving data with parts
50:54 - so I'm here at eight and I have one two
50:56 - three four five six more to do in terms
50:59 - of this data and API so you can't even
51:01 - see what I'm typing you and it's
51:02 - terrible um so aid you guys have any
51:04 - thoughts you have any questions well
51:06 - how's this list sound in terms of images
51:08 - just instagram vs flickr vs google image
51:12 - search have any appeal to you let me
51:15 - know and it's 1045 i think actually
51:18 - unfortunately this is probably gonna be
51:20 - it for me today i have to move on and
51:23 - get ready for class that happens in life
51:26 - with real people yeah and I mean and so
51:31 - I think that's i'm going to do these
51:32 - tomorrow so i did seven and eighty two
51:35 - more which i think is good and tomorrow
51:37 - I'm going to do i'll probably get do
51:38 - word nick in the new york times but I'm
51:40 - but I'm curious if guys any feedback or
51:42 - any questions anything it's anybody
51:48 - actually still watching I don't know if
51:51 - you are let me know any feedback and
51:54 - questions like should i do like a can
51:58 - like twirl but I'm waiting that's like
52:00 - my load I this is my loading animation
52:02 - like personally like I'm loading or
52:04 - waiting animation that's actually that
52:06 - would be a good topic which is like how
52:08 - data takes a long time to get how do you
52:09 - have a program but they're so this is
52:11 - this list could go on and on and on
52:13 - because actually to be honest with you
52:14 - something I need to add to this is a
52:18 - multiple callbacks and closures this is
52:23 - a bit beyond the scope of what we're
52:25 - doing in the course this sort of like
52:27 - intro to programming course here at ITP
52:29 - but this really is a necessary topic and
52:33 - related to that is like and that really
52:36 - you know part of that is loading
52:39 - animation I have a whole I actually have
52:43 - a URL page of notes where I wrote up
52:45 - about this that you could look at I see
52:49 - maybe a question I know this might be
52:50 - covered in the map function video says
52:53 - malomi
52:54 - and you should make a sketch on how many
53:00 - people are watching this video well I
53:01 - could do that pretty easily you just
53:03 - create the word 10 it says 10 for me uh
53:07 - thank you I'm glad that you guys have
53:09 - enjoyed this so I don't know actually in
53:11 - some ways I think it might make more
53:12 - sense for me to do these more often and
53:14 - just do them for an hour I've been doing
53:15 - them a once a week for like two or three
53:16 - hours because that's kind of what my
53:18 - schedule eyes I'm gonna have yeah but
53:22 - can you talk about how changing the map
53:25 - parameters to 45 made it appear on
53:27 - screen okay sure yeah so that I guess
53:29 - maybe that wasn't particularly clear
53:31 - what I did what I did is let's let me
53:36 - come over here to the whiteboard a
53:37 - second so oops so what i did when i
53:42 - change the map parameters is as follows
53:46 - so if this is the canvas and I say you
53:53 - know this is like pixel 0 this is pixel
53:55 - like 600 but I'm basically mapping from
53:58 - negative the measurements I'm map and go
54:00 - from negative ninety to ninety and if
54:02 - the current measurement is like well I
54:05 - don't know let's say that's not drawn in
54:07 - the right place is like 45 and then the
54:10 - next measurement i get is 45.2 it's just
54:13 - going to move like a tiny bit but what i
54:16 - did was essentially Zoop by by changing
54:19 - what the minimum and maximum latitude of
54:21 - latitudes are it's as if I'm like
54:24 - zooming in on this section if I say this
54:26 - is 45 and this is 50 a change of point2
54:30 - in that range will map to many more
54:32 - pixels whereas change of point2 with
54:35 - this range maps to very few pixels so
54:37 - that's what needed appear visually it
54:39 - was moving in both of those but when it
54:41 - moves like point 3 pixels versus when it
54:43 - moves 30 pixels it just is visually it's
54:46 - a much stronger effect does that make
54:48 - sense we'll check the chat ah how giphy
54:53 - api oh that's a great suggestion
54:55 - Antonius hi Antonius what time is it in
54:58 - China Antonius so gifty let me add that
55:02 - as
55:05 - the parolee the sort of issue with giphy
55:08 - is that rendering the gifts is sort of a
55:10 - tricky issue because their animations
55:11 - but that I could definitely do how about
55:13 - storing data to a database so I'm not
55:15 - going to work at present with like a
55:18 - whole database setup which would involve
55:20 - like server-side programming but i'm
55:22 - going to what i'm going to do is show
55:23 - you a web service called parse which is
55:26 - one that I use a lot you can use it for
55:28 - free although if you use it a lot you
55:29 - need a paid account but when parses is
55:31 - essentially a database on somebody
55:33 - else's server that you have an account
55:34 - with that you can just send data and
55:36 - retrieve it and actually i have an
55:39 - example that i'll build which is you
55:41 - have the user make a drawing and it's a
55:43 - if they're drawing to the database and
55:44 - the user can load their drawing again
55:45 - later so i will that's the sort of
55:47 - example that I hope to demonstrate at
55:49 - some point in a particular video any
55:52 - last questions before I go now's your
55:56 - chance and I gained a couple viewers
56:03 - just what I'm leaving but you can watch
56:04 - this you can watch this back it'll get
56:07 - archived as soon as I hit stop on the
56:08 - stream I just found out ah so someone's
56:12 - asking is this live stream happening on
56:14 - a regular basis so my goal is to
56:17 - ultimately have a regularly scheduled
56:19 - live stream possibly even several times
56:22 - a week I'll probably start that honestly
56:25 - favorite 2016 because right now but
56:28 - currently sorry what you don't care
56:30 - about that but what's happening right
56:32 - now is I'm doing these every week on
56:33 - thursday either in the morning or the
56:36 - afternoon eastern standard time and i'm
56:38 - posting when i'm doing it usually on
56:40 - twitter i should probably have like a
56:43 - URL like when is my next live stream not
56:46 - that i have that many people who are
56:47 - like interested but just so people could
56:50 - check that I know when I can't figure
56:52 - out YouTube the YouTube live page it
56:54 - sometimes it says the next stream is at
56:56 - I can't find anywhere where I put that
56:58 - in like a look I've asked YouTube
57:00 - support no one's given me an answer so
57:01 - if somebody help me figure that out on
57:03 - the live page I'll always put like when
57:05 - the next dream is happening to do it
57:06 - today Wednesday just so they had some
57:07 - extra time but this is a really why yes
57:09 - sir um but so and I just like put it up
57:13 - on Twitter this morning but I
57:15 - I'm going to do this again tomorrow
57:16 - Thursday and have it'll happen around
57:21 - I'll start sometime between
57:23 - twelve-thirty and 1 p.m. eastern time so
57:25 - i have a meeting that goes until a
57:26 - little after twelve as soon as i get the
57:28 - system set up I'll just start i'll be
57:30 - doing this for an hour to tomorrow and
57:32 - I'm gonna continue this discussion now
57:34 - that said all of these videos get
57:36 - archived on YouTube and I even like chop
57:38 - them up into chunks that are a little
57:39 - bit more digestible than this longer one
57:41 - so you can see it that way yeah parse is
57:45 - great I I like using lots of nice
57:47 - solution okay so i think i'm going to go
57:49 - it is a 10 of 11 and i thank you all for
57:53 - watching I didn't play I just press the
57:56 - play at but this time and I'm going to
58:01 - come back tomorrow I'm going to try to
58:02 - upload these videos at some point when I
58:03 - have a chance today and see you guys
58:06 - soon send me your eye the bat by the way
58:09 - the best way if you want to ask a
58:10 - question is to just ask it in the
58:12 - YouTube comments because I'm kind of
58:13 - obsessively tracking those to try to
