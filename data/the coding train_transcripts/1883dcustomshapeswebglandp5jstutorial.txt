00:00 - okay I've got another webgl in p5 video
00:04 - for you and in this one instead of
00:06 - drawing oh I erased everything on the
00:08 - whiteboard it's fine I don't need to go
00:10 - over there in my list instead of drawing
00:11 - a primitive shaped like a cube a sphere
00:14 - a torus a cone etc I am gonna make my
00:17 - own shape with begin shape and end shape
00:20 - so let's look at how that works so this
00:23 - has a box with a kitten as the texture
00:27 - when I'm done I want to see just a
00:29 - custom shape also with the kitten as a
00:31 - texture let's see if we can make this
00:32 - work okay so let's take out the box
00:37 - let's take out the texture just for now
00:39 - and let's say normal material hopefully
00:43 - this is gonna work now what I'm gonna do
00:45 - is I'm just gonna say begin shape and
00:48 - end shape and I have another video
00:51 - tutorial just about how begin shape and
00:53 - shape and vertex works and you can go
00:55 - refer to that one once you're into the
00:57 - 3d world there's a lot of possibilities
00:59 - we could tile with triangle strips and
01:01 - do all sorts of different things but I'm
01:02 - gonna just make a single shape that has
01:06 - that has vertices and it's like a
01:09 - basically like a quad I'm gonna make a
01:11 - quad so I'm gonna say vertex just to
01:14 - start 0-0 vertex 100 comma zero vertex
01:21 - 100 comma 100 vertex zero comma 100 and
01:28 - I think an important thing that I need
01:30 - to path here is close so what am i doing
01:32 - I have 0 0 100 comma 0 100 comma 100
01:42 - zero comma 100 so I this is my path and
01:46 - all of a sudden out the clothes
01:49 - parameter in end shape makes the last
01:52 - vertex connect to the first vertex ok so
01:55 - let's see this is the equivalent of
01:57 - doing plane right this is like doing
01:59 - plane but I'm doing it with begin shape
02:00 - and edge shape
02:03 - alright I don't see anything
02:05 - let's try fill there we go oh
02:12 - so normal material didn't work but
02:14 - that's fine Phil works
02:16 - can I get ambient material to work no so
02:24 - those seem like they might be bugs right
02:26 - now I'll have to investigate those who
02:27 - come back in this video or write
02:28 - something in the description but I
02:30 - really wanted to show you something
02:32 - about texturing and first of all let me
02:33 - just put Phil back the thing that I want
02:35 - to show you that's important is once I
02:38 - have these custom vertices I can start
02:40 - to really do weird things like for
02:41 - example what if this last vertex over
02:44 - here you know was a little bit more to
02:47 - the right I now have this kind of quad
02:50 - that's not a standard square and also
02:53 - like maybe I want to it's a sort of like
02:55 - Center itself so right now I could say
02:58 - just really quickly I mean I could redo
03:01 - all these vertices but I'm just gonna
03:02 - translate by like negative 50 comma zero
03:05 - and so now I kind of have this quad
03:08 - moving around at the center a bit more
03:10 - so let me put this back and we can see
03:14 - this is just like plain negative 50 I'm
03:19 - sorry negative 50 comma negative 50 it
03:20 - should be okay so now this is just like
03:23 - plain now what I want to do is texture
03:26 - this geometry so what's interesting
03:27 - about this is let's just say I add right
03:31 - now texture oops
03:33 - I'm gonna take texture kitten instead of
03:37 - film interesting website I don't see it
03:41 - why now something's happening but I
03:43 - don't see the kitten why not so this is
03:45 - what's really interesting about working
03:47 - with textures and custom shapes a vertex
03:51 - is defined by its X Y point or really in
03:56 - this case X Y Z that's what this is this
04:00 - is really zero zero zero 100 zero zero
04:03 - right I just sort of ignoring the Z but
04:04 - I probably put that in there if I want
04:07 - to take image data like a JPEG or a PNG
04:11 - or whatever and basically place that
04:15 - image data inside of that polygon the
04:19 - thing that I'm defining I need to say
04:22 - hey zero zero goes with what pixel
04:25 - this pixel 100/0 goes with what pixel
04:29 - this pixel now this would be kind of
04:30 - like a literal mapping of saying like
04:32 - this image gets mapped exactly onto it
04:35 - but what you see about this is you can
04:37 - start to do a lot of different things I
04:38 - will also refer you to a video about a
04:41 - flag simulation that I also have that
04:44 - does the same exact thing but with a
04:45 - more complex geometry so for the vertex
04:50 - function instead of just X Y Z I can
04:54 - also have you V the U and V coordinates
04:58 - are the pixel mappings on the image and
05:01 - I believe in p5 by default these are
05:06 - normalized so there are different ways
05:10 - this can be done but what I mean by
05:12 - normalized is this is actually 0 0 this
05:15 - is 1 0 this is 1 1 and this is 0 comma 1
05:19 - even if this is a 640 by 480 image so
05:24 - basically so let's look at how that
05:26 - works and let's start adding those UV
05:29 - coordinates in so I think this should be
05:31 - so let me add the 0 in because I have a
05:33 - feeling it might not it's probably gonna
05:36 - figure it out properly without the 0 so
05:39 - I'm going to now say this is 0 0 this is
05:44 - 1 comma 0 this is 1 comma 1 UV and this
05:49 - is 0 comma 1 so let's try that there we
05:53 - go there's the cat on our custom shape
05:58 - now it's so dark let's just pump up the
06:03 - ambient light here all right so I just
06:06 - wanted to add ambient more ambient so we
06:08 - could see it now here's the thing that's
06:09 - interesting these mapping you now have a
06:14 - lot of creative possibilities like for
06:16 - example what if I just took out this
06:19 - point right what if I put this what if I
06:21 - need this a triangle and kind of move
06:24 - this point to 50 comma 50 so let's try
06:30 - that
06:30 - so this lap this vertex is actually
06:33 - going to be 50 comma 50 and we should
06:36 - see look and you can see how it's sort
06:38 - of trying to figure out
06:39 - best as it can how to kind of squish the
06:42 - kitten in and probably in this case just
06:45 - this rotation stuff is more trouble than
06:47 - it's worth you can see this is what it's
06:49 - done how its decided to try to smush the
06:51 - kitten into that geometry and this of
06:54 - course could move like I could say Mouse
06:56 - X Mouse Y which is going to produce a
07:00 - really weird results but you can see
07:02 - this is me kind of like stretching so
07:04 - you could imagine you could have an
07:05 - algorithm that's changing the geometry I
07:07 - could have many many more points there's
07:11 - so many possibilities here another thing
07:13 - that I might that I'd love to show that
07:15 - I think's worth showing is what if I
07:17 - reverse so take a look at this kitten
07:20 - see that kitten it's looking that
07:24 - direction what if I flip the pixels and
07:28 - say this pixel should go with 1 comma 0
07:33 - and this should go with 0 comma 0 this
07:37 - should go 0 comma 1 and this should go
07:39 - with 1 comma 1 now the kittens looking
07:42 - the other direction what if I didn't
07:44 - flip the bottom I'm good no kittens will
07:48 - be harmed turning this like that's
07:51 - something weird crazy happen because the
07:52 - top was flipped and had to like twist it
07:54 - to get the bottom so and these can be
07:56 - variables right this could be these
07:58 - could be variables that are changing and
07:59 - oscillating I could you know if I go all
08:02 - the way back whoops let me get that let
08:09 - me get our kitten back there I could do
08:11 - something like I actually only want to
08:12 - see the top half of the kitten so the
08:15 - why are both 0.5 now that's the top half
08:17 - stretched into this stretch into the
08:19 - shape so there's a lot of I'm really
08:21 - just scratching the surface here but as
08:23 - you start to make your own shapes you
08:27 - can texture them and assign different
08:29 - pixels of different images and different
08:31 - parts of an image to different vertices
08:35 - of that sounds of that shape alright so
08:39 - hopefully this was helpful
08:41 - hold on my cap wait ready yeah
08:46 - you know there's still again after the
08:48 - time of this recording there seem to be
08:49 - some bugs with how custom shapes work in
08:53 - p5 WebGL hopefully any of you watching
08:55 - like decide to file a bug or look into
08:57 - fixing a bug in a friendly and
09:00 - supportive way and hopefully and and
09:04 - please tag me at Schiffman on github if
09:06 - you post an issue related to this video
09:07 - or of course you can also ask at forum
09:11 - processing org in the p5.js category if
09:13 - you have kind of questions about how
09:14 - this stuff works so thank you very much
09:17 - and I look forward to seeing your custom
09:19 - geometry with textures in p5 GS
