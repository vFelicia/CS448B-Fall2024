00:00 - hello my name is Dan I'm awkward but I'm
00:04 - making kind of a promotional video
00:05 - what's in this channel here so I like to
00:08 - make videos about programming and I hope
00:09 - that you watch them and maybe learn
00:11 - something new make some art make
00:13 - something different think about the
00:14 - world in a different way and in these
00:16 - videos I use two different programming
00:18 - environments I use something called
00:19 - processing here's processing three built
00:21 - on top of the Java programming language
00:23 - p5.js built on top of the JavaScript
00:26 - programming language both of these are
00:27 - part of the processing Foundation which
00:29 - is a nonprofit organization I'll leave
00:31 - that for another video but what kinds of
00:33 - things do I have in my videos you might
00:34 - like to learn about are you interested
00:36 - in drawing and art and color and images
00:38 - well one of the things you can do with
00:40 - processing is read input from a camera
00:42 - you can draw stuff onto the screen
00:44 - shapes here now all of these circles are
00:46 - being colored according to me uh-huh
00:49 - and then so you can see this is kind of
00:52 - interesting you can learn about how to
00:53 - do stuff like this another thing that
00:55 - I'm super interested in is looking at
00:56 - the natural world not natural the world
00:59 - itself how do things work this is a
01:01 - flocking system originally developed by
01:03 - Craig Reynolds and the implicit
01:04 - influence it and in processing looks at
01:06 - patterns of like birds or bees or what
01:08 - about you know physics and motion and
01:10 - tree growth and fractals you know for
01:12 - interaction design for art for game
01:14 - design for programming games this is
01:15 - useful content I have a whole lot of
01:17 - videos about this sort of stuff are you
01:18 - interested in making stuff that runs on
01:20 - the web you could look at some of my
01:21 - videos about p5.js data is something you
01:25 - might be interested in here's an example
01:26 - that queries the New York Times says hey
01:28 - New York Times how many times did the
01:30 - word computer appear from 1950 to 2015
01:33 - and you could see a little graph of that
01:34 - and also just like I don't know if I
01:37 - wanted to make some weird thing with
01:38 - some sliders on a page that like danced
01:40 - back and forth by themselves I have a
01:42 - whole video that just looks at how you
01:43 - do that so how do you make stuff happen
01:45 - on the web I did this in under two
01:47 - minutes that was my entire goal I've
01:48 - never done that before so watch it send
01:50 - me an email send me a tweet I've got to
01:52 - stop five four three
