00:00 - alright I'm back for a second Chrome
00:03 - extension video and I'm gonna pick up
00:05 - right where I left off which is I want
00:07 - to add something called a background
00:10 - script now the truth of the matter is
00:14 - the background script can do a lot of
00:16 - things it's Co the content script I'm
00:18 - saying what I just said at the end of
00:19 - the last video but to repeat myself the
00:21 - content script is code that executes
00:23 - after a webpage loads that you can
00:27 - affect and manipulate and work with the
00:30 - actual content of the web page itself a
00:33 - background script is a script that loads
00:36 - when you launch chrome and it's
00:38 - listening for events associated with the
00:40 - activity of using the Chrome browser as
00:43 - a piece of software itself so one of the
00:46 - things I could do in a background script
00:48 - is I can listen for things called a
00:49 - browser action there's also a page
00:51 - action there's all sorts of kinds of
00:53 - events but a browser action is actually
00:56 - a way of listening for it for example I
00:58 - can add a button to the menu bar with my
01:01 - own design and I can listen in the
01:03 - background script which I'm gonna call
01:05 - background j/s I can listen for when the
01:09 - user has clicked that button and then I
01:12 - can make something happen potentially on
01:13 - the web page or I could make something
01:15 - happen within chrome like close all the
01:17 - tabs or something like that lots of
01:19 - things are possible so what I want to do
01:20 - in this video is show you instead of
01:23 - having the previous video I made a
01:24 - Content script that runs immediately
01:26 - when you load the page instead what I'm
01:28 - gonna do now is have a background script
01:30 - that has a button and when you press the
01:33 - button it causes the content script to
01:35 - run so it doesn't run immediately but
01:37 - only when you press the button alright
01:38 - so let's see if we can make that happen
01:40 - so the first thing I need to do is tell
01:42 - manifest.json about the background
01:45 - script tell manifest.json oh so I think
01:48 - I need comma background can I have more
01:53 - than one background script I think
01:55 - actually just say background right
01:59 - somebody will correct me and then is
02:02 - that an array it's an array no it's it's
02:05 - you can't so unlike content scripts I
02:07 - think you could have multiple content
02:09 - scripts a background script is one
02:11 - background script you get multiple
02:12 - backgrounds
02:13 - protect it per extension you have
02:15 - multiple JavaScript files associated
02:16 - with the background script but just one
02:18 - so this is just an object with J with
02:21 - the J s property and I'm gonna call that
02:25 - background is okay I think this is good
02:32 - so now I need to create that javascript
02:34 - file background j s and I'm just gonna
02:39 - put console dot log background running
02:42 - just to have something in there okay so
02:46 - I have this background script now oh
02:48 - this should be an array same problem I
02:50 - forgot before content dot J s this
02:52 - should be an array so let's not make
02:54 - that mistake again and now what I'm
02:57 - going to do coding train extension I'm
03:01 - just gonna call this coding training
03:01 - attention to I'm so now I'm gonna load
03:05 - that unpacked extension background
03:07 - script it's in this folder there we go I
03:10 - didn't get any errors Google Chrome
03:13 - cannot prevent extension from recording
03:15 - your browsing history that's it oh I I
03:16 - clicked allowing you to about by
03:18 - accident okay so now this is running
03:20 - alright this is very exciting
03:22 - let's go back to this page and hit
03:26 - refresh content script ran up Chrome
03:31 - extension go oh but where does it say I
03:34 - totally console.log background running
03:37 - how come I don't see background running
03:39 - here so here's the thing the content
03:42 - script is a thing that executes inside
03:44 - of the actual web page and so the debug
03:47 - stuff is available in the JavaScript
03:50 - console the background script is running
03:53 - as part of the browser as a whole it
03:55 - does not talk to the get JavaScript
03:57 - console associated with a given page
03:59 - instead you're gonna have to go back to
04:02 - debug any console logs in the background
04:05 - script in a different place let me show
04:06 - you where that is so what I'm going to
04:09 - do here is now oops sorry I need to go
04:13 - to this page right chrome slash last
04:15 - extensions and then oops oops oops
04:20 - so what I'm looking for actually what
04:23 - you see down here which is inspect views
04:25 - back
04:26 - Paige and I don't see that the reason is
04:28 - I got this wrong this should be scripts
04:30 - for content scripts it was js4
04:33 - background its scripts whatever this is
04:36 - the specification for how a Chrome
04:38 - extension works let me hit I'll hold
04:40 - that drama for nothing let me hit reload
04:42 - now same saying I can go here Chrome
04:46 - extension go like that that console.log
04:49 - that's in my background script is not
04:52 - appearing in the JavaScript console in
04:53 - the browser but if I go back to the
04:55 - extensions page I now see that it says
04:57 - inspect views I can click there and now
05:00 - I can see here I can look at the
05:03 - JavaScript console for the background
05:05 - script so this is just an important
05:07 - piece debugging is tricky because you
05:08 - got to remember is this part of the
05:10 - background script is this part of the
05:11 - content script where is it all happening
05:14 - okay now let's actually add a browser
05:17 - action so what I'm going to do is I'm
05:22 - going to now in the in manifest I'm
05:25 - gonna say browser action : mmm
05:33 - what is it what does it was it was a
05:35 - browser action I think that's a default
05:40 - icon maybe icon default icon default
05:43 - icon and then I'm gonna give it my
05:47 - coding training PNG so one thing I can
05:51 - reference by the way what I'm not sure
05:54 - if you can have assets and different
05:56 - media things associated with like a
05:58 - Content script and you can add that and
05:59 - we'll get to that I guess at some point
06:00 - with future examples but right now I
06:02 - want to have a browser action and I want
06:05 - the browser action to be associated with
06:06 - a button I need a PNG for that button so
06:08 - did I already put this sorry I have to
06:12 - navigate to this right so I have this
06:16 - PNG file that I'm gonna put in now into
06:19 - there so you can see here now I have
06:21 - manifest that JSON background is content
06:24 - items and I have this PNG file so now if
06:27 - I reload the Chrome extension again we
06:31 - can see look at that all the way up
06:33 - there
06:34 - there's my button now anyway I could
06:36 - design it a lot better
06:38 - it probably has all this that PNG
06:40 - all this extra but now if I press this
06:43 - button I'm triggering a browser action
06:45 - so I need to listen for that browser
06:49 - action where does the content script
06:53 - listen for the browser action no the
06:55 - content script is sandbox it's Walden it
06:59 - only knows what's happening here so I
07:02 - need the Baraat the background script to
07:04 - listen for when I click the button so
07:06 - let's add a bit of code for that I go to
07:11 - the background script what I add to that
07:15 - is it's I think it's chrome dot browser
07:20 - action dot not clicked on clicked I
07:25 - haven't written up there uh head
07:29 - listener button like you know button
07:36 - I'll just call this button clicked and
07:39 - then I can I can write a function the
07:42 - callback function so let me give you
07:44 - some more room so you can see this they
07:47 - make this little smaller I can write
07:49 - this function called button click this
07:50 - is me making up a function now this is
07:52 - my made-up callback it could be an
07:53 - anonymous call back loop there's a
07:56 - camera up here that I just hit it could
07:57 - be an anonymous function written in
07:58 - there but I'm gonna do this in a simple
07:59 - way and I believe and then I could just
08:02 - say console dot log button clicked so
08:08 - let's do that so let's do that and so
08:14 - there is actually a thing that I'm
08:15 - forgetting here which is that well let
08:17 - me just add this first so if I go reload
08:20 - the extension and then I go inspect
08:25 - views and put this over here and I'm
08:28 - gonna click the button now button
08:30 - clicked so you can see above my head
08:31 - here that message is coming out when I
08:33 - click the button so I now have a
08:35 - function that's listening no matter
08:36 - where I am but what if I want to know
08:39 - like oh when I click the button what's
08:41 - the current tab that's open and actually
08:43 - this callback gets an argument which has
08:46 - information about the tap so I'm going
08:48 - to actually just console.log the tab
08:49 - object so we can see I'm going to reload
08:53 - and I'm going to click the button and
08:55 - now we can see look at this so there's
08:58 - all sorts of information that I can now
09:00 - get about the particular tab that I'm on
09:04 - so you really have in the Chrome
09:06 - extension in the background script which
09:08 - is making use by the way this is part of
09:10 - the chrome API right chrome browsers
09:13 - that's not just like available
09:14 - JavaScript code wherever you are but by
09:16 - default I have some pointing to come
09:18 - back and look at the chrome API
09:19 - reference but this is where I can do
09:23 - things I've listened to events okay now
09:25 - what I need to do is tell the content
09:28 - script about it but the content script
09:31 - is stuck inside of its wall it can't
09:36 - reach out and know about this except for
09:38 - the fact that there is a and this
09:41 - doesn't really go in this list I guess
09:42 - if I just other like some of concepts or
09:44 - api's chrome API so there is we saw
09:52 - there's like a chrome dot browser action
09:56 - that's one thing we just saw there's
09:58 - another thing which is messaging so
10:02 - there's a messaging API there's a way
10:04 - that I can send a message from the
10:10 - background script really should go here
10:11 - there's a way I can send a message from
10:14 - the background script to the content
10:15 - script and vice versa so that's where I
10:17 - need to do let's look at how we can do
10:19 - that so oops so what I'm gonna do inside
10:23 - button clicked I'm going to say chrome
10:29 - tabs a send message so this is the this
10:36 - is the jet this is from the Chrome
10:38 - extension API the chrome object there's
10:41 - an object called tab so I could send a
10:42 - message I think to all tabs actually but
10:45 - what I want to do is just send a message
10:46 - to the particular tab that I'm on so I'm
10:49 - gonna say something like this tab ID
10:51 - right and we can see that where I debug
10:54 - that here ID
10:55 - 95 each tab as an
11:06 - what I want to do is send the message as
11:08 - an object so text hello I mean this is
11:14 - silly so because you can send a lot of
11:16 - information you could imagine there
11:17 - might be a lot of information going on
11:18 - that you could send here so let me show
11:20 - you this so I am going to now send this
11:23 - message so once I have this code that's
11:26 - sending the message I need to receive
11:28 - that message and where I receive the
11:30 - message is in the content script so I
11:32 - now need chrome message receiver what is
11:36 - it I have no idea I have it somewhere on
11:38 - the wall where I that's good
11:40 - ah runtime so there's an event there's a
11:43 - chrome runtime on message this is a
11:46 - particular kind of event and I need to
11:48 - have a listener add listener and and
11:55 - then I need a callback so I could say
11:57 - like got message so I can now write a
12:00 - function called got message and it
12:03 - receives what it receives a lot of
12:06 - things there's it's kind of like it's
12:08 - similar to a get or post request there's
12:10 - three arguments that go here there's a
12:12 - request
12:12 - there's the sender and then there's the
12:15 - send response this is kind of
12:18 - boilerplate e and then ah so where do I
12:21 - get that message so the in the
12:24 - background script this JavaScript object
12:27 - let message write this message going
12:31 - this this stuff going in there is in
12:33 - this request variable now I employ this
12:35 - from an example so I might actually call
12:37 - this like the message so I could say
12:41 - console dot console dot log message dot
12:46 - txt so let's just see if the message
12:49 - comes through let's see if the message
12:51 - comes through so I'm gonna reload I'm
12:54 - gonna reload the Chrome extension I'm
12:58 - gonna go to this page Chrome extension
13:01 - go I'm gonna click the button hello
13:03 - hello hello hello I got a message from
13:08 - the background script to the content
13:10 - script which means I could say something
13:12 - like if message text equals hello
13:21 - then only do this stuff then if message
13:27 - if I get a certain message now run this
13:30 - code that alters the page so here we go
13:32 - I am going to have to reload the
13:35 - extension I'm gonna refresh the page now
13:39 - notice the content script has not
13:44 - executed all of the paragraphs are as
13:47 - they were now I'm gonna press this
13:50 - button and they're all purple so I could
13:52 - immediately make it that every time I
13:54 - press the button it picks a new random
13:55 - color it just replaces all the text with
13:57 - something it reaches out to an API and
14:00 - goes and gets the definition of every
14:01 - word on the page onward neck and then
14:03 - makes those like pop ups all over the
14:04 - page there's so many things I can do
14:06 - this is the basic idea
14:08 - there's too many videos about Chrome
14:10 - exchangers I want to make is we've
14:11 - barely scratched the surface here but at
14:13 - least now we've seen manifest.json is
14:17 - the overall configuration of the Chrome
14:20 - extension what is it allowed to do and
14:23 - when is it allows to do it the content
14:27 - script is JavaScript code that lives
14:29 - within the actual content of any given
14:31 - web page that you happen to be on and
14:33 - the background script is code that runs
14:37 - as soon as chrome is launched that can
14:39 - listen for various events and do a
14:42 - variety of other things to affect how
14:44 - the browser as a whole behaves so what
14:47 - we've seen in this example which is
14:48 - really again just scratching the surface
14:49 - is through a there's different actions
14:54 - the browser action there's also
14:56 - something called a page action I'm gonna
14:58 - get to all this stuff later but the
15:00 - background script can listen for a
15:02 - browser action like pressing a new
15:03 - button and then send a message to the
15:06 - content script to do stuff to the
15:07 - content so basic idea I'm gonna come
15:10 - back and in the next flu
15:14 - I did not trigger that sound effect yeah
15:19 - but apparently everyone's really excited
15:22 - so with just these two videos I think
15:25 - you could probably make something kind
15:27 - of interested quirky and creative that
15:29 - subverts and alters the way one
15:31 - traditionally browses the web so if you
15:33 - make something share with me on Twitter
15:35 - at Schiffman share it in the comments I
15:36 - forgot I'm always supposed to say like
15:38 - and subscribe everybody tells me I'm
15:39 - supposed to say that whatever if you
15:41 - feel like it like it subscribe and I'm
15:44 - going to also next do a coding challenge
15:47 - where for any given web page through a
15:51 - browser extension I can press the button
15:52 - and replace all the images with images
15:55 - of kittens so that's what I'll be doing
15:56 - I'm gonna turn these into like a little
15:58 - bit of a coding challenge and then I'm
15:59 - gonna come back and do more stuff I'm
16:01 - gonna add p5 to a Content script lots of
16:04 - other things so there'll be a whole
16:04 - bunch more videos in this Chrome
16:06 - extension bookmarklet playlist thanks
16:08 - for watching
16:09 - [Music]
16:17 - you
