00:00 - I sorry I've I get lost in this
00:04 - beautiful kittens eyes so I'm gonna do a
00:06 - coding challenge right now and the
00:08 - coding challenge is the kitten eyes or
00:12 - chrome extension kit narrator kitten
00:16 - extension kitten Chrome extension chrome
00:18 - kitnik add up I know what to call it
00:19 - somebody give me a name we'll put it in
00:21 - the first comment I'll pin it but I'm
00:23 - going to make a Chrome extension that
00:25 - replaces any image on any website that
00:27 - you're on with an image of a kitten I'm
00:29 - gonna do it in a really simple basic way
00:31 - I made earlier today a bunch of
00:33 - tutorials about Chrome extensions I
00:34 - might suggest you go and watch those for
00:36 - more depth but I'm gonna still do this
00:38 - from no code at all the only thing I'm
00:40 - going to start with is these five kitten
00:42 - images and they all come from
00:44 - unsplash.com which is a website with
00:47 - free images these are the images that I
00:49 - have randomly picked for this coding
00:51 - challenge and as a challenge to you
00:53 - after I make this if it's successful you
00:56 - might think about making a version of
00:57 - this that pulls the images dynamically
00:59 - from unsplash or uses something besides
01:01 - kittens or tries to replace the image
01:03 - with the most appropriate kitten that
01:04 - matches what the imager usually was I
01:06 - don't know use your imagination but
01:08 - let's get started so the first thing I
01:10 - need for a Chrome extension is what it
01:13 - is a file called manifest.json okay so
01:18 - what do I need in the manifest.json I
01:20 - need to say I need to have all the
01:22 - configuration stuff for my Chrome
01:24 - extension manifest version 2 which is
01:30 - the version of Chrome extension whatever
01:32 - that I'm making someday I'm gonna look
01:33 - up what this means but I think it used
01:35 - to put one but now you have to use two
01:36 - maybe someday you'll put three I don't
01:38 - know could you imagine a world in a
01:40 - world where the manifest version is
01:42 - number seven then I'm going to X kittens
01:47 - John X kitten shouldn't thank you that's
01:49 - a good good one okay Chrome kittens okay
01:51 - now I'm gonna say name X extension and
01:59 - then X kit tension I think like that X
02:04 - kitten
02:05 - Chrome X kitten chin that's is not so
02:07 - great but we'll keep this for right now
02:10 - Bo version everybody knows what version
02:13 - this is
02:13 - right right now say it with me 1 2 3
02:17 - did you say point well I'm yeah that's
02:19 - what I said I don't know whatever
02:20 - doesn't matter and I think I should put
02:23 - that in quotes who knows and then I'm
02:27 - making a Content script so what I need
02:31 - to do is have a Content script and it's
02:34 - content scripts because I could have
02:35 - multiple ones so I'm just gonna have one
02:36 - if you don't know what a Content script
02:38 - is you could go look at my previous
02:40 - tutorials which I will link to in the
02:42 - description and my content script this
02:45 - is going to be for see how do I do this
02:52 - this is hard to talk and think and type
02:55 - at the same time all URLs so I want you
02:59 - might someday want to make a Chrome
03:01 - extension that only replaces kittens on
03:03 - particular websites only places images
03:06 - with kitten but I'm gonna do it for all
03:07 - URLs and then I need to have a
03:11 - JavaScript file where I'm gonna have all
03:13 - my code I think I say J s and then I
03:15 - could have multiple JavaScript files but
03:17 - I'm just gonna have one I'm gonna call
03:18 - it content J yes although you know what
03:20 - no I'm not no not I'm gonna call getting
03:22 - getting done is okay now here's the
03:24 - thing let's just first make sure this
03:26 - works I got to deal with the images
03:27 - that's one thing I didn't do in my
03:28 - tutorials I probably got some syntax
03:30 - wrong here because I never get it right
03:32 - but I'm at least going to now make a new
03:34 - file which is called kitten j/s and I'm
03:38 - going to just in that say console dot
03:39 - log kittens of the world unite as one
03:45 - okay so I will lease now I'm gonna have
03:49 - a Chrome extension that when I go to any
03:52 - web page I will see this in the
03:53 - JavaScript console that's our first step
03:55 - and again if you want some of the
03:57 - details about how this is working go
03:58 - back and watch my I'm gonna stop saying
04:00 - that
04:00 - so now how do I install this I've got to
04:02 - be in Chrome at the URL chrome colon
04:06 - slash slash extensions I've got to have
04:08 - developer mode enabled and then I can
04:11 - say load unpacked extension I can go and
04:14 - find wherever that was was on my desktop
04:16 - under Chrome extension zero three
04:19 - kittens so I'm gonna select that and it
04:22 - didn't get any errors so if I had made
04:24 - it a syntax error in manifest.json
04:27 - stuff would show up here and then it's
04:29 - enabled I'm gonna just turn off this
04:31 - other extension that's fine I'll leave
04:32 - it on and now I'm gonna go to a web page
04:34 - like what's a good web page we want to
04:38 - replace all the images with kittens I'm
04:41 - afraid to go to a news website although
04:42 - it will be nice to replace everything on
04:44 - the news website with images of kittens
04:46 - let me just go to go to the ITP website
04:51 - for right now just to just to see okay
04:54 - whoa oh this is something else this has
04:58 - nothing to do with me and we can see
04:59 - that this extension is working because
05:01 - kittens of the world unite as one there
05:04 - we go so my extension is working on the
05:06 - next thing I need to do is I need to
05:08 - figure out from my content script I need
05:11 - to look at the content and find all of
05:13 - the image elements on the page now
05:16 - there's probably a variety of ways that
05:20 - you can have an image but let's actually
05:21 - just play with this here for a second
05:23 - let's use the console to kind of like
05:26 - mess around to understand what we want
05:27 - to do so if I say images equal document
05:31 - get elements by tag name IMG hmm
05:38 - Oh images right so we got a bunch
05:41 - there's a whole bunch of images so
05:43 - that's good and we can see images has a
05:45 - property called source I believe
05:50 - somewhere in your boy there's a lot of
05:53 - stuff
05:53 - yes it's an attribute source and you can
05:56 - see that's the source of the image some
05:58 - are at Tisch gift a preset dot square
06:01 - JPEG so what I want to do is look at all
06:04 - these images find that source property
06:07 - and replace what's in there with a URL
06:09 - to an image of a kitten now I'm not just
06:12 - any kitten the kittens that I happen to
06:14 - have as part of my extension of course
06:16 - they could be URLs to other places but I
06:18 - have these particular now I know I could
06:22 - probably load these in like an array but
06:25 - what I'm gonna do is let me just first
06:26 - let's this is gonna there's gonna be a
06:29 - little tedious go make yourself a cup of
06:31 - tea or something for a second there we
06:32 - go okay so now I've got the images
06:33 - here's the thing files inside just like
06:38 - in manifest.json
06:40 - I have to say ah I want this javascript
06:43 - file to be part of my content script I
06:45 - always also have to say I don't remember
06:47 - what there's somebody in the chat
06:49 - correct me it's something like web
06:51 - accessible resources is that right
06:55 - somebody will correct me alright just I
07:01 - have the file names here - thank you
07:02 - very much that would have been more
07:04 - efficient breaking news somebody I'll
07:06 - have that sound effect okay so I think
07:09 - what I can do now is just let's do
07:11 - something fancy I'm gonna do something
07:13 - fancy just for fun for no reason I'm
07:17 - gonna copy this into here I'm gonna do
07:19 - the fine I'm gonna get rid of all those
07:21 - slash slash space then I'm gonna do I'm
07:25 - gonna use a little regular expression
07:27 - I'll show you I'm - I'm going to do
07:28 - beginning of a line dot star question
07:31 - mark end of line this is a regular
07:33 - expression to find all of these things
07:35 - then I'm going to replace and I just
07:37 - want to do it I'm gonna replace it with
07:40 - and do I need to capture I need to
07:42 - capture this you don't know about
07:44 - regular expressions might I offer you to
07:46 - my regular expressions tutorial that
07:47 - would pop up right here except there's
07:49 - no way for me to do that unless some
07:50 - magic post-production thing happens I'm
07:53 - gonna replace this is really ridiculous
07:54 - that I'm doing this with quote dollar
07:57 - sign one end quote comma a place off
08:02 - boom now I haven't arrived now have it
08:04 - formatted to go into an array oh it
08:08 - needs to be double quotes for JSON
08:11 - that's fine uh so find a single quote
08:14 - replace it with a double quote there we
08:16 - go so now I have the web accessible
08:18 - resources and maybe somebody has told me
08:20 - I am being told breaking news that is
08:22 - correct
08:23 - alright so web accessible resources so
08:25 - now these images are available to me as
08:28 - part of my Chrome extension so what I
08:33 - want to do if somebody by the way is
08:35 - watching this video could find me a good
08:36 - just like maybe in the in the patron
08:38 - group in the slack channel maybe you
08:41 - could post some links to some websites
08:42 - that might be good to run this on that
08:44 - have nothing to upsetting or
08:46 - embarrassing on them it's all order I
08:48 - know with the internet family-friendly
08:51 - coding show here every
08:53 - so now what I want to do is I lost my
08:58 - train of thought I want to do this in
09:02 - the Chrome extension itself now remember
09:04 - a content script and let's say let's say
09:08 - file names and I can get this from that
09:13 - you know there's probably an automatic
09:15 - way of doing this but I am very prone to
09:18 - doing things in silly manual ways so I
09:21 - have an array now with all those file
09:23 - names and I'm going to ask for all of
09:27 - the image elements then then I'm going I
09:32 - know I'm using double quotes and single
09:34 - quotes in the same page don't everybody
09:35 - freak out all at once
09:36 - let's live with it let's come on we can
09:38 - do it double quotes and single quotes
09:41 - can be in the same page and everything
09:43 - will be okay all right now let me say my
09:48 - new favorite thing which is this fancy
09:49 - four loop thing that I learned about
09:51 - recently for image element of images I
09:56 - want to say I'm just gonna actually
10:00 - console.log image element SRC let's just
10:06 - do that so I just want to see the Chrome
10:07 - extension on any page that I'm on give
10:09 - me a list of and I'm just gonna check
10:11 - the shot here for a second web
10:17 - accessible resources should be on the
10:19 - top level of the manifest also put them
10:22 - on a folder and just do so these are
10:25 - great suggestions from should thank you
10:28 - so let's make some improvements here
10:30 - silly me so first of all this is not
10:32 - necessarily specific to the content
10:35 - script this is a top-level thing for the
10:37 - manifest thank you for that correction
10:39 - and there's no reason for me to do this
10:42 - when I can just say star dot jpg so this
10:48 - should be better so any images and by
10:52 - the way it would make more sense as I'm
10:55 - being told to make a folder called
10:56 - kittens and that way this is cleaning
11:00 - this up a little bit all of this goes in
11:03 - here then
11:05 - can say kittens / so how am i doing
11:08 - think I'm in better shape let's reload
11:10 - the Chrome extension and see what
11:11 - happens I'm going to go back to here and
11:13 - hit reload right anytime you make
11:15 - changes in your chrome X get insertion
11:17 - hit reload hit refresh and I could see
11:22 - this is some nonsense that's happening
11:24 - nothing to it and I can see look here
11:26 - are all of the images that are on this
11:28 - page now the question is to do the
11:32 - there's gonna be a sizing thing that we
11:34 - have to deal with at some point but I'm
11:35 - not gonna worry about that okay example
11:38 - page image J nih.gov slash Docs okay
11:43 - hold on let me find this I really need a
11:45 - good way of getting stuff from the slack
11:47 - chat into here can you give me a Google
11:52 - search Reuben to find that page okay so
11:57 - now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
12:00 - I think we're kind of so all I actually
12:02 - need to do is I want to say let R equal
12:05 - math dot random times images Oh
12:08 - filenames dot length math.floor so I
12:17 - don't have not in p5 so I've got to do
12:19 - this with native JavaScript I want to
12:21 - get a random index and I could do this
12:23 - all sorts of other fancier ways I'm sure
12:24 - but I want to get a random math dot
12:26 - random gives me a number between zero
12:27 - and one
12:27 - multiply it by the length of the array
12:29 - take off the decimal place and if I have
12:31 - ten images I'm getting a number randomly
12:32 - at zero through nine and then I want to
12:35 - say let source equal file names are and
12:45 - then I also need to do let URL so here's
12:48 - the thing I can't just say image alt
12:51 - equals image alt dot source equals
12:56 - source so here's the thing about a
12:57 - Chrome extension these files like where
13:00 - do they live they're part of the Chrome
13:01 - extension the source the source
13:04 - attribute of an image element on a web
13:06 - page has to point to a actual valid path
13:09 - and those chrome extension paths I live
13:12 - probably they're like a weird thing that
13:14 - we don't know it is fortunately for us
13:16 - the Chrome
13:17 - extension API so let's actually try to
13:19 - look up where this is Chrome extension
13:26 - Chrome extension Chrome what am i Chrome
13:32 - extension get URL image or something so
13:36 - I want to find it in the documentation
13:38 - ah extension dot get URL so this is what
13:43 - I want I want to say browser is this
13:46 - right I thought it was Chrome extension
13:48 - oh is this like am I in the ah well this
13:51 - is like a generic thing even higher
13:53 - level than this is just like a browser
13:55 - interestingly enough a lot of the stuff
13:57 - that's part of Chrome extensions while
13:59 - part of the chrome API is modeled off of
14:02 - this more generic somebody will know
14:04 - more about this than I do okay so I'm
14:06 - looking for this in chrome Chrome
14:09 - extension I just want to find the page
14:10 - get URL here we go this is what I'm
14:16 - looking for this is the API this is what
14:18 - I want so this is the documentation page
14:20 - on include some of these links in the
14:21 - video this is a Chrome extension this is
14:23 - part of the API and I won't get URL get
14:26 - URL gives you the URL of a path that's
14:29 - part of your Chrome extension so I
14:31 - should be able to say equals Chrome
14:35 - extension dot get URL source and let's
14:40 - call this file source is sort of the
14:42 - wrong thing and just because I'm curious
14:48 - let's actually do this to put it in a
14:52 - variable and then set that to URL and I
14:55 - just want a console.log that URL so here
14:58 - we go I think we're actually pretty good
15:01 - I think this is done we just need to
15:03 - find some better web pages to run this
15:05 - on oh I need to reload the Chrome
15:08 - extension
15:14 - I didn't work at all let's look at the
15:20 - console hmm Dan 9 load um what resources
15:26 - must be listed in the web accessible
15:28 - resources manifest key in order to be
15:30 - loaded by pages outside the extension
15:32 - yeah yeah web accessible resources hmm
15:38 - oh wait a sec oh no oh oh I know what
15:44 - the problem is I put everything in a
15:45 - kitten's folder and then in my extension
15:48 - I forgot to say they all have to have
15:54 - the kittens folder prefix okay here we
15:59 - go again here we go again I have to
16:06 - reload let's find a better web page
16:10 - let's let's just be bold and go to the
16:13 - New York Times and let's see if we can
16:16 - replace the image is on the New York
16:18 - Times with kittens
16:29 - kittens kittens kittens kittens all
16:37 - right so we can see here there's some
16:39 - work to be done here
16:40 - oops let's just let's browse the web now
16:43 - NASA seems like a website that I might
16:45 - enjoy going to look at oh look and look
16:49 - at this NASA website what's happening in
16:51 - NASA these days but actually I like the
16:53 - fact that when I google image search for
16:55 - something like puppies it's all kittens
17:04 - look kittens
17:07 - oh boy kittens puppies but that's a
17:09 - kitten so even if I search for unicorns
17:17 - it's all kittens and I could go to the
17:20 - unicorn Wikipedia page and it is a so
17:24 - interestingly enough not all images get
17:26 - replaced let's so New York Times for
17:28 - example I bet you load some images
17:30 - through JavaScript in a different way
17:31 - let's inspect this element here it is I
17:38 - don't know why so I'd have to
17:41 - investigate you know there's this looks
17:44 - like source it's like a thumbnail that
17:47 - it's actually looking at maybe over the
17:48 - image so there's all sorts of complexity
17:50 - with how different web pages work so we
17:52 - don't have to Wikipedia is not a good
17:54 - example of this let me think of one more
17:57 - let's just go to a Schiffman net there
18:01 - we go this is nice
18:03 - so thank you that you've got to
18:06 - definitely do quite a bit more to make
18:08 - this the robust kitten eyes or her
18:11 - Chrome extension that I always hoped it
18:12 - would be so let me give you some
18:13 - exercises if you want to follow along
18:15 - with its coding challenge think about
18:17 - other things that you might replace on a
18:18 - webpage how you might replace text how
18:21 - you might replace images how you might
18:22 - play sounds there's all sorts of
18:24 - possibilities there find a different set
18:26 - of images maybe you could actually use
18:28 - the unsplash API to dynamically pull
18:31 - different images I will post the code to
18:33 - this you will find a link to the github
18:35 - repository where this code exists in the
18:37 - video's description and in the next
18:39 - coding challenge i'ma do something very
18:40 - similar but instead of
18:41 - replacing with images may be able to
18:43 - leave the kitten thing here I'm gonna
18:44 - make a Chrome extension that I can draw
18:46 - over the page thank you for watching
18:53 - [Music]
18:57 - you
