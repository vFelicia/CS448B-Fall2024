00:00 - Hello, here I am from the
future to insert a video here
00:03 - in between 2.5 and 3.1.
00:06 - This is less of a fundamentals
of programming concept,
00:09 - and more of a computer
graphics concept.
00:11 - But it is just, like, being
asked to me so many times--
00:15 - over, and over, and over again--
00:16 - that I feel the need to add
this as a tutorial, here.
00:19 - So, what so many people
are trying to do--
00:21 - in watching these
tutorials and learning
00:23 - to program graphics in p5--
00:25 - is have something
that you can paint.
00:27 - Like, draw a trail, or
something that layers over time.
00:29 - But also, something
that doesn't have
00:31 - that trail, that
animates without leaving
00:33 - where it was before.
00:34 - And, in fact, the
true answer to that
00:36 - is, you know, maybe
you would want
00:37 - to wait until object oriented
programming in arrays.
00:41 - Because later, you'll
see some techniques
00:42 - for doing this where you
can just, like, store
00:44 - all the information.
00:45 - And store the history
of the information,
00:47 - and draw it, or not draw it.
00:48 - But for right now, I'm going
to show you a technique.
00:50 - And I actually have a
video about this already,
00:53 - but it uses some fancier
things that kind of
00:55 - aren't at this point, here,
in this tutorial series.
00:58 - You could go look at that other
video about create graphics,
01:00 - too.
01:00 - But I'm going to show you
how create graphics works.
01:03 - So, this is what I have right
now, I'm going to show you the.
01:05 - Problem this is a p5
sketch, where I want
01:08 - this square to move around.
01:10 - But I want it to animate
without leaving a trail.
01:15 - But I also want to be able
to paint over this canvas.
01:18 - And I can't now, because if
I click, it draws the circle.
01:22 - But it's not drawing its trail.
01:23 - Oh, so I can take the
background out and then now,
01:26 - oh, I can paint.
01:27 - But oh, now, that.
01:28 - So either I'm not erasing
the background and everything
01:30 - has a trail, or I'm erasing
the background and nothing
01:33 - as a trail.
01:33 - So there is a way
around-- not around this.
01:37 - Which is to use something
called create graphics.
01:39 - And we'll create
graphics will actually
01:41 - let me do is basically
have two canvases.
01:43 - I can have two canvases,
one with trails, one
01:45 - without trails.
01:46 - And the one with trails,
like, can kind of, like,
01:48 - layer on top of the
one without trails.
01:50 - So, I want, like, so here,
let's put background back here.
01:55 - So this is no trails, and
this is, here, trails.
02:04 - Right now, everything is being
drawn on this one canvas,
02:07 - so everything is no trails.
02:09 - So, instead, I can
make a variable.
02:11 - I'm going to call
it, like, canvas two.
02:12 - It's sort of like
our extra canvas.
02:14 - Maybe I'll call it--
let's just, yeah.
02:16 - Like, I'll call it extra
canvas, very silly,
02:19 - silly variable name,
but let's call it that.
02:21 - And I'm going to
say, extra canvas
02:24 - equals create graphics 400, 400.
02:30 - So what this is doing, is just,
like, this is create canvas.
02:33 - It's a little bit
weird, like, why don't I
02:34 - just say create canvas?
02:36 - Well, you have to use
different terminology.
02:38 - The canvas is only
in p5, it's the thing
02:41 - that refers to the actual
thing that you're seeing.
02:43 - But I want to create an
off screen canvas that's
02:45 - a graphics object.
02:47 - And so, now, once I have
that, I can do things
02:50 - like say, extra
canvas background.
02:55 - And I'm going to
say like, 255, 0 0.
02:57 - Now, we don't see it, I've drawn
this red background, 255, 0,
03:01 - 0 on another canvas.
03:02 - How do I see that canvas?
03:04 - Well, the way that
I see that canvas
03:06 - is, by saying, image
extra canvas 0 0.
03:12 - So, basically, this is me
drawing the extra [INAUDIBLE]..
03:14 - But I don't see it.
03:15 - Why?
03:16 - Because I immediately drew
the background after it.
03:18 - So let me comment
out this background.
03:20 - Then you say, look
the extra canvas
03:22 - is there, behind the
thing that's moving.
03:24 - This is kind of what we want.
03:25 - But, I actually want to do
this in a different way.
03:28 - I want the extra
canvas to be on top.
03:31 - I want the extra canvas
to come at the end.
03:34 - Oh, but now I don't see the
stuff on the main canvas,
03:37 - because the extra
canvas is covering it.
03:38 - Well, guess what?
03:40 - I can actually call a
function, instead of drawing
03:42 - a background called clear.
03:44 - And what clear does, is it makes
that extra canvas completely
03:47 - transparent.
03:48 - So, now, I have a completely
see through extra canvas
03:51 - sitting on top of
the regular canvas.
03:54 - And guess what?
03:55 - What if now I draw stuff
to that extra canvas?
03:58 - Like, I draw the
ellipse extra canvas.
04:03 - So instead of saying
just plain ellipse,
04:05 - I'm saying extra canvas dot.
04:07 - And the reason why I don't
want to put this here,
04:09 - is this involves some syntax
that we're not familiar with.
04:12 - It's a variable dot
a function name,
04:14 - and this is foreshadowing
object oriented programming.
04:17 - But, for now, you can see
I'm drawing the ellipse
04:19 - on this extra canvas.
04:21 - And I am going to set the
extra canvas to have no stroke,
04:26 - and the extra
canvas to have fill.
04:27 - And now look at that,
I'm drawing a trail ,
04:31 - and that is not drawing a trail.
04:32 - Now, let's make this
a little bit more
04:35 - clear, what's going
on, just for a second.
04:41 - Because I want the square to
be quite a different color.
04:44 - So I to make it red, so
you can really see it.
04:48 - And what's
interesting about this
04:49 - is, note, so I'm drawing but
no, look, I can draw over it.
04:52 - So I am drawing over it, so this
is sort of like code one, where
04:58 - I'm drawing over it.
04:59 - What if I want the red
thing to be on top?
05:01 - Well, no problem, I'll
just move this, right?
05:08 - Actually, all I could do is move
the drawing of the rectangle
05:11 - after I draw the extra canvas.
05:12 - Let's see if that works.
05:14 - There we go.
05:15 - So, now I'm painting underneath.
05:16 - The background for
the main canvas
05:18 - is still at the beginning, then
I layer in the transparent one,
05:21 - then I layer that.
05:22 - So what I saw students and
people watching this try to do
05:26 - is try to create,
like, a lot of stars.
05:30 - Even though this video
can really be done,
05:31 - I'm going to have two
code examples linked
05:35 - in the video's description.
05:36 - I'm going to duplicate this.
05:37 - I will show you what
people were trying
05:39 - to do instead of painting.
05:40 - One thing you might want to
do is have a lot of stars.
05:45 - In which case-- if you
were using random--
05:49 - I'm going to take out
if mouse is pressed.
05:52 - And I'm going to say, let star
x equal random width, let star y
06:01 - equal random height.
06:02 - And, you know, you might
have a nicer visual design
06:05 - than just an ellipse.
06:06 - But I'm going to star x, star y.
06:08 - I'm going to draw an
ellipse at star x and star
06:10 - y, that's like 10 by 10.
06:12 - And then if I run
this, oh, look at that.
06:15 - Why, I totally forgot the
thing that I'm doing, right?
06:17 - This is the thing, I'm
drawing all these stars
06:20 - but the whole point of
this is I want to draw them
06:23 - on the extra canvas.
06:25 - Extra canvas.
06:25 - So, now, you see
this is a way that I
06:27 - can layer things up randomly,
while something is animating.
06:30 - By not erasing the
background on part,
06:32 - by erasing the
background on part.
06:33 - So I'll clean up both
these code examples
06:35 - and link them in this
video's description.
06:37 - Hope this, like, answered the
question that a lot of you
06:39 - seem to have right at this part.
06:40 - OK, see you later.
