00:03 - okay so we're moving along here we're
00:05 - gonna look at a bunch of different boxes
00:07 - the examples a bunch of different topics
00:09 - bunch of things different things you can
00:10 - do and each video hopefully will be
00:12 - somewhat short just touch on a key
00:13 - concept in box2d
00:15 - look at the code example move on to the
00:17 - next one so one of the things we missed
00:19 - if you recall from our first box of
00:21 - these scenario is we figured out how we
00:23 - could add make our objects move around
00:25 - and respond to box 2d physics what if we
00:28 - want an object that doesn't move what if
00:29 - we want a fixed object we could see two
00:31 - scenarios of that here one is look at
00:34 - these platforms these are actually
00:35 - shapes bodies that don't move static
00:38 - bodies and the second one is actually
00:39 - this thing called to change shape which
00:41 - is allowing us to make this kind of
00:43 - terrain like thing so I want in this
00:44 - video we're just gonna look at both of
00:46 - these talk them through and kind of
00:47 - quickly look at the code so the good
00:49 - news is this one incredibly simple so if
00:52 - you remember we had these steps right
00:54 - well we need to define a body create a
00:56 - body create a shape create a fixture
00:57 - baloise all those steps we worked it out
00:59 - for the fixed shape that doesn't move
01:02 - for that platform we only need to change
01:04 - one thing in step one we need to have a
01:08 - static body instead of a dynamic body we
01:10 - just need to make it static so let's
01:12 - look and see how that's done in this
01:13 - particular code example so I'm gonna try
01:16 - to pull it up now here it is so if we
01:21 - look at it so okay so remember what
01:22 - things I want to point out about this by
01:24 - the way is this example also has a box
01:26 - and I'm just pointing out a small little
01:29 - detail which is that all of that code
01:30 - for all those five steps which we do in
01:32 - the constructor sometimes a little
01:34 - useful just to make a little function
01:36 - that kind of takes care of all that so
01:37 - this this this example actually has a
01:39 - make body function and if I scroll down
01:41 - into the make body function you'll see
01:44 - highlighted here this key line of code
01:46 - the type of this body is dynamic and
01:48 - that's for all these squares that are
01:50 - moving around the screen but what about
01:52 - for these platforms if we go into the
01:53 - boundary class the boundary class is
01:55 - very similar the only difference is the
01:58 - body type is static so you can make
02:00 - objects with a dynamic body type or a
02:02 - static body type the static ones won't
02:05 - move so if you're making pinball and all
02:07 - the bumpers are static and they don't
02:09 - move those would all be static body
02:11 - types so that's really easy
02:13 - this one is a bit more complex so for
02:16 - this type of scenario where you want to
02:18 - make a terrain are a chain an edge a
02:21 - some type of surface that has an edge
02:22 - that cannot be penetrated this is a
02:25 - scenario where we we have we are making
02:27 - it's a static body but the the way that
02:30 - this is defined is with a shape a
02:32 - particular kind of shape and that kind
02:34 - of shape is called the change shape so
02:36 - and we're in the right place here if we
02:38 - look through all these steps this is the
02:40 - only step in the in the scenario that
02:43 - we're modifying so we're making a body
02:45 - we're defining the body creating the
02:46 - body we've got to make the fixture all
02:48 - those parameters and attach the shape to
02:49 - that fit to the body but create shape is
02:51 - what we're going to change and the kind
02:53 - of shape we're gonna make is a change
02:55 - shape so our first line of code for that
03:01 - section would just look something like
03:03 - this creating a change shape object
03:06 - that's what we're gonna do instead of a
03:07 - polygon shape change shape got it okay
03:11 - so how do we make so polygon shape well
03:13 - remember we did set as box and we gave
03:15 - it a width and a height a change shape
03:17 - is kind of an interesting thing so let's
03:19 - just look at this scenario where we have
03:21 - this is much like that game I don't know
03:23 - if you ever play the game tiny wings
03:25 - where you have this nice terrain that
03:26 - the birds kind of like scoot along and
03:29 - jump up and fly right what if you wanted
03:30 - to create a terrain like this well in
03:32 - order to do that you would want to know
03:34 - what are all the points along this path
03:37 - what are all of these vertices and it
03:40 - turns out to make a change shape what
03:42 - you need is an array of vector objects
03:45 - that define all of those vertices along
03:46 - the path so if I were to make a vector
03:50 - object and I can call this vertices and
03:53 - I would say it's going to have I'm gonna
03:57 - have three vertices in my array of
04:00 - vector objects all I would need to do is
04:03 - say hey let me give vertex zero
04:07 - something vertex one something vertex
04:10 - two something so we make a change shape
04:13 - we make an array of vertices and then
04:16 - overhead out of room we're gonna stick
04:18 - those vertices into the changing so
04:20 - that's the process now one thing that's
04:22 - very important here is remember
04:24 - something important there from that one
04:26 - thing that's important
04:26 - something important one thing that we
04:28 - cannot forget is what type of
04:30 - coordinates do we need to put here world
04:32 - coordinates so we might know the pixels
04:34 - of our terrain we need to convert those
04:37 - from pixels to world before we stick
04:39 - them in the array and before they go
04:41 - into the chain shape so let's go take a
04:43 - look at that example and see exactly how
04:45 - this is implemented so here's the code
04:49 - for the actual example that's running
04:50 - this particular sketch and you'll notice
04:52 - something a little strange about this
04:53 - I'm using an ArrayList of ektu objects
04:56 - and I'm putting the pixel locations of
04:58 - all those vertices into that ArrayList
05:00 - so what gives right over here we said
05:03 - hey we need to make an array of vector
05:07 - objects and we need to make sure we
05:08 - convert those and put those into the
05:10 - gene chain shape well I've done
05:11 - something a little bit strange in this
05:12 - example and there's certainly alternate
05:14 - ways that you could organize your code
05:16 - but one of the things that we're gonna
05:17 - need to do later is draw that that that
05:20 - terrain that chain shape on the screen
05:22 - so what I'm doing is I have this
05:24 - ArrayList where I'm gonna stick all of
05:27 - the vertices in pixel coordinates in
05:29 - that ArrayList to save it for later when
05:31 - it comes time to draw it but when I
05:33 - create the shape the chain that's
05:35 - actually gonna be in the box to the
05:36 - world to the box so you can compute the
05:37 - physics that's when you'll see here if I
05:40 - scroll down a little bit here what we're
05:42 - doing is we're saying hey let's make an
05:44 - array the same size of our ArrayList and
05:47 - let's take every vertex from the
05:50 - ArrayList convert it to world
05:51 - coordinates and put it in that array and
05:53 - that's what will make the chain with so
05:55 - this is kind of redundant we have two
05:57 - arrays one for the pixel versions one
05:59 - for the world versions but I find that
06:01 - useful that you don't have to then later
06:03 - at you know can be converting back and
06:05 - forth if we just keep track of both and
06:07 - two separate arrays the change shape
06:09 - knows the world coordinates the
06:10 - ArrayList knows the pixel coordinates
06:12 - and makes things sort of simple so you
06:13 - can see here we're making the change
06:15 - shape where we're making me array and
06:17 - then here's the function create chain
06:19 - with that array and this is a little bit
06:21 - redundant but we're also telling it hey
06:22 - we want to use the entire array so in
06:24 - theory you have to give it the array of
06:26 - vertices for that change shape as well
06:27 - as how much of the array you want to
06:29 - loot use in this case the entire length
06:31 - of the array and you can see that all
06:33 - the rest of it is making the body
06:34 - definition creating the fixture all of
06:36 - that so and then when it comes down to
06:39 - drawing it
06:40 - and the display function we're doing
06:42 - something very simple begin shape and
06:44 - shape and drawing of vertex for every
06:47 - single one of those a vertex for every
06:49 - single one of those spots in the chain
06:51 - shape okay so these are two ways that
06:54 - you can create static objects in box2d
06:56 - one is with a with bodies that are fixed
07:00 - that are static and the other is with
07:03 - the change shape so two exercises you
07:05 - can think of doing one is hey try to
07:07 - make one where those platforms aren't
07:10 - flat but at an angle how do you set the
07:12 - initial angle of a body and make sure
07:13 - you draw it at the right angle give that
07:15 - a try
07:15 - and another exercise you could do is
07:17 - this is just hard-coded values for the
07:19 - vertex vertices but what if you used a
07:21 - sine wave how would you create a shoot
07:25 - and I'm gonna if I was faster on the
07:28 - draw here I would have had this ready
07:29 - but how would you do something like this
07:34 - where and this is a very tiny window I
07:36 - apologize for that where the edge is
07:38 - actually a sine wave or could you use
07:40 - Perlin noise to create a mountainous
07:42 - like terrain or how would you even do
07:44 - something where you create this nice you
07:46 - know perla noise to create something
07:47 - like this like the the train and
07:48 - something like tiny wings so give those
07:50 - things to try there's there's answers
07:52 - that you'll find in the github
07:53 - repository if there's not simply an
07:55 - email already to comment and the next
07:58 - video we're going to look at I think
08:00 - we're to look at making more complex
08:02 - more complex forms either custom
08:05 - polygons or bodies that are made up of
08:07 - multiple shapes
