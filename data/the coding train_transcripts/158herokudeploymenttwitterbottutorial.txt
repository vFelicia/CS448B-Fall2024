00:00 - hello in this video I am going to look
00:02 - at how to deploy your Bot written in
00:04 - node.js
00:05 - to uh a server and that server being one
00:07 - that runs on a service called Heroku so
00:10 - let's take a look at the pieces so you
00:11 - can see here I have my browser open to
00:14 - my test account A2Z ITP which uh I most
00:18 - recently just tweeted a bot tweeted a
00:20 - random number 39 and I have the code for
00:24 - that bot open right here you can see it
00:25 - in Sublime it's very simple it has a
00:27 - single function that tweets that random
00:29 - number number uh and then I also have my
00:33 - terminal open to that directory and I
00:35 - could just really quickly test to make
00:37 - sure that bot works the bot is starting
00:40 - it worked let's go back to the browser
00:42 - I'm going to hit refresh and we can see
00:44 - now I got random number four so
00:47 - everything is working the point is in
00:49 - this video is I want to say this bot
00:52 - that's running right over here I don't
00:54 - want to run it from my laptop I want it
00:56 - to run autonomously on a server
00:57 - somewhere that I can set it to go and
00:59 - never think about it again so let's
01:01 - tweet it again let's quit it um and look
01:04 - at how we can do that so the site that
01:06 - I'm the the service that I'm going to
01:07 - use in this particular video is Heroku
01:10 - so um you'll need an account so you know
01:13 - if you're watching this video and you
01:14 - don't have a Heroku account go to uh
01:17 - Heroku
01:18 - dcom Heroku spelled this way.com
01:24 - and you can see here I went there now
01:27 - now I'm already logged in so it went
01:29 - straight to my my dashboard and you can
01:32 - see that I have all these things already
01:34 - listed on my dashboard because
01:36 - apparently I've tried to make a variety
01:38 - of I've tried to do this a whole bunch
01:40 - of times test this test that delete soon
01:42 - Etc so what are these things these
01:44 - things are referred to as
01:47 - dinos I think that's right not dinos D
01:50 - NS dinos Dy NS like a dynamic thing
01:54 - that's running it's a process that
01:55 - you're running so what I need to do is
01:57 - create a dyo
02:00 - to run my bot so the very first thing
02:03 - that I'm going to do is go up here to
02:05 - this plus sign up in the top right and
02:08 - I'm going to say create new app so app
02:10 - is really what I'm doing I'm going to
02:12 - create an app I'm going to call it uh
02:15 - coding rainbow uh
02:18 - demo uh should only contain lowercase
02:21 - letters okay rainbow demo uh it is
02:25 - available I'm going to create
02:27 - it and it is now there so there's a
02:31 - whole bunch of things I need to do here
02:33 - and one of the things about using Heroku
02:37 - is Heroku is kind of its own animal it's
02:39 - not really an animal it's a web server
02:41 - but whatever it's it's its own it has
02:43 - its own way of doing things and the way
02:45 - that you send things to Heroku and get
02:47 - things back from Heroku is two ways one
02:50 - is you use git what is git oh boy if you
02:53 - don't know what git is stay tuned for my
02:55 - upcoming set of git and GitHub tutorials
02:57 - but for now if you don't know what git
02:59 - is is um you're going to be you'll still
03:02 - be able to follow this but you're just
03:03 - going to have to verbatim kind of
03:05 - copy I heard a
03:09 - noise there's a person somewhere nearby
03:12 - I have to keep going anyway okay um uh
03:15 - you can just sort of verbatim copy um
03:17 - some of these uh
03:21 - commands um okay so now I'm waving to
03:25 - somebody who uh it's my my neighbor Joe
03:28 - I love Joe he's a great CR
03:30 - uh he came and said hi the other day
03:32 - okay I got to keep going here so um so
03:34 - you can see here that on the Heroku page
03:37 - it's even giving you some sort of
03:38 - commands that you can follow we'll worry
03:40 - about that in a moment but we're missing
03:43 - one other aspect here the first thing
03:45 - that it's saying to do is saying Heroku
03:48 - login meaning log into your Heroku
03:50 - account from terminal somehow so if I go
03:53 - over here and I type in Heroku
03:56 - login it says command not found so one
03:59 - of the things you need in order to work
04:01 - with Heroku is a piece of software
04:04 - called the Heroku tool belt so I
04:06 - probably should have pre installed that
04:08 - but I'm just going to Google Heroku tool
04:11 - belt I'm going to click on the first
04:13 - thing that comes up and I'm going to
04:15 - download it and I think it's GNA this is
04:17 - going to happen quickly enough that I
04:19 - can just do this I'm going to install it
04:22 - continue continue
04:25 - install uh password and there there we
04:29 - go I'm installing it I do my installing
04:35 - dance I don't know I I didn't I like the
04:39 - weird thing about me doing this dance
04:40 - while this video is going I have a
04:42 - preview screen I'm like watching myself
04:44 - over here I supposed to just dancing to
04:46 - the camera that was very weird I will
04:47 - edit that out that no one that someone
04:50 - will make a weird gift out of that or
04:52 - something okay so now I should be able
04:54 - to go
04:55 - back and type in Heroku look at that oh
04:59 - install tool I didn't even know it was
05:00 - going to do that so maybe you have to do
05:03 - that I was about to just say Heroku log
05:05 - in but I just was typing Heroku to make
05:07 - sure it works apparently I have to do
05:08 - another dance because it's installing a
05:11 - bunch of stuff oh that was I don't have
05:14 - to dance okay so now we can see um I
05:17 - should be able to say Heroku login and
05:20 - it should ask for my credentials my
05:22 - account is under my email my password is
05:26 - [Music]
05:29 - I'm logged in so now that I'm logged in
05:32 - I can actually start to do things which
05:35 - would allow me to deploy uh from
05:37 - terminal here all the stuff for my bot
05:41 - to Heroku itself so let's go back
05:46 - now to this
05:49 - page and uh oh actually this page no
05:54 - this page sorry and we can see here now
06:00 - now that I've logged into Heroku the
06:02 - next thing I need to do is make my uh
06:08 - bot into a git repository again the what
06:12 - git is if you're not familiar with it is
06:14 - out of the scope of this particular
06:15 - video but it's a Version Control
06:19 - software and uh what it's going to allow
06:22 - me to do is once I turn it into a git
06:25 - repository meaning all the code for my
06:27 - bot is in this folder it's going to
06:29 - allow me to push that git repository to
06:32 - Heroku because everything that lives on
06:33 - Heroku is also a git repository so I'm
06:36 - going to be able to follow these
06:37 - commands the first thing I'm going to do
06:39 - is say get
06:40 - init get
06:43 - init and it initialized an empty git
06:46 - reposit now if you get if I type got by
06:49 - the way instead of git it's going to say
06:50 - got command not found if you get this
06:53 - error meaning git command not found this
06:56 - just means you need to download and
06:58 - install git so if I Google git the very
07:01 - first thing that comes up is this
07:03 - particular website
07:06 - g-.& I can just uh somewhere here uh H
07:10 - right right here I can download for Mac
07:12 - or for Windows or whatever it is you're
07:15 - so you can download and install git and
07:16 - and if if for some reason you didn't
07:18 - have that already okay now that I've
07:20 - done that the next command that I need
07:23 - to go to is this Heroku get remote- a so
07:29 - what what I'm doing is I'm saying I want
07:31 - my git repository this thing that lives
07:33 - on my computer I want it to be linked to
07:36 - a remote place that remote place far off
07:39 - in the distance is Heroku and I not just
07:42 - want to link it to Heroku but I want to
07:43 - link it to my app that's coding rainbow
07:46 - demo so I can just take exactly this
07:50 - here and I can type put that into
07:52 - terminal I see it over here on my
07:54 - preview screen and there we go it's all
07:57 - set now and
08:00 - then I can go here and I can say the
08:05 - next thing okay so the next set of
08:06 - commands here is now I actually want to
08:09 - send the stuff to Heroku the way that
08:12 - you send stuff to Heroku is with a
08:13 - command a git command called push in get
08:16 - push means send pull means receive so
08:20 - there's a there's there's a lot to
08:22 - there's a lot to this but I first thing
08:24 - I need to do is like add and commit and
08:26 - so I'm just going to follow these
08:27 - commands I someday this will link to my
08:29 - get tutorials which will explain all
08:31 - these commands so I'm going to say get
08:33 - add and then I'm just going to use
08:35 - exactly I'm going to say commit get
08:37 - commit D am make it better this I could
08:40 - put my own comment in here I'm going to
08:42 - say uh oh and you can't this needs to
08:44 - move like a little bit over here I'm
08:45 - going to say uh uh this is my
08:50 - bot and it did that and then I'm going
08:53 - to say get push Heroku
08:56 - Master get push Heroku Master which will
09:00 - send it so now it's sending it to Heroku
09:03 - and it's going to do all sorts of stuff
09:05 - to try to run
09:07 - it the thing is I missed some steps so
09:10 - these would have been the steps if I had
09:12 - a kind of traditional
09:14 - old-fashioned uh web application you
09:16 - know I made some sort of server it
09:18 - serves up web pages people log onto my
09:20 - server they see the web pages but that's
09:22 - not actually what I made I made this bot
09:24 - which is just this process that needs to
09:26 - run behind the scenes uh with no there's
09:29 - no web server there's no place there's
09:30 - no URL for anyone to go to I just want
09:32 - this thing to run on the server so I
09:34 - have over here I'm just want to make
09:36 - sure I get the syntax right my notes um
09:40 - and uh okay so in order to do this I'm
09:43 - missing a particular piece so first
09:47 - thing I want to do actually by the way I
09:49 - really should have practiced this in
09:50 - advance but this is fine so there's so
09:53 - let's here we are we' kind we've got
09:55 - okay what have we done so far we wrote
09:57 - the code for our bot we pushed it to
09:59 - Heroku and we and it even just sort of
10:01 - said verifying deploy done it didn't
10:03 - give me any error messages so let's
10:05 - actually go and look now I'm going to go
10:07 - back to uh my
10:09 - dashboard and I should see here I should
10:12 - be able to find oh yeah sorry whoops I
10:15 - should be able to find coding rainbow
10:17 - demo I'm going to click on that and
10:19 - we're going to see um it says sleeping
10:23 - so it's not really working it's not
10:25 - really doing anything yet the reason
10:27 - it's not doing anything yet is because
10:30 - it is listed as a web app I need to
10:34 - change this to be what's called a worker
10:37 - app and that's what I was talking about
10:38 - a worker is a web app is something that
10:40 - serves up web pages a worker is
10:42 - something that just works behind the
10:44 - scenes with its own process and that's
10:45 - what the bot is so in order to do that I
10:49 - need to go back to my code here and I
10:51 - actually need to create a new file so
10:53 - this is my folder with all the stuff and
10:56 - I need to create a new file and I need
10:58 - that file to be
11:01 - called I'm going to save it uh
11:04 - P file proc file this is the process
11:08 - file it's a configuration file that
11:10 - Heroku will look for to know what is it
11:13 - that this thing is supposed to do so I'm
11:15 - going to save that and in that file I'm
11:17 - going to say this thing is actually a
11:19 - worker not not a web application and it
11:23 - its job is to run node bot. js so I'm
11:28 - going to save save that in there and
11:30 - then I have got to go back and this is
11:33 - again um if you're unfamiliar with Git I
11:38 - here's the thing I need to I made some
11:40 - changes to my project now I need those
11:42 - changes to go onto Heroku those changes
11:45 - are only locally on my laptop so to do
11:47 - that I need to say get add dot this is
11:50 - adding my changes and I need to say
11:53 - commit which is giving a message to
11:55 - those which is adding the proc file you
11:59 - can following those this is the same
12:01 - things I did for the first one and then
12:02 - I can say get push Heroku Master this is
12:06 - sending it to Heroku Master Heroku is
12:10 - our
12:11 - Master uh and now that done it's
12:17 - finished uh as I do my little dance I
12:21 - have to wait for all this to finish
12:23 - launching verifying deploy Etc now I
12:27 - should be able to go here and hit
12:28 - refresh
12:31 - and I see now I see look at that it says
12:34 - worker node bot. js and this I want to
12:38 - turn off I need to hit edit I want to
12:40 - turn off the web the web process confirm
12:46 - and I want to turn on the worker one
12:50 - confirm and
12:53 - now as far as I
12:55 - know oh my goodness boy we we sent a lot
12:58 - of tweets
13:00 - um you can see now it's uh you can see
13:03 - it's it's running now so it was probably
13:05 - running it's interesting that it
13:07 - actually worked maybe earlier but now it
13:09 - should be running every 20 seconds it
13:11 - should um post a new tweet and we should
13:14 - be able to see this by the way uh if I
13:17 - back here say Heroku
13:19 - log uh oh what I meant log is not a
13:23 - command perhaps I meant logs and in fact
13:25 - yes I meant
13:27 - logs uh Heroku
13:31 - logs and you can see by the way this is
13:34 - running because there's two new
13:36 - tweets uh and here uh it
13:42 - worked right so
13:45 - um this is oh yeah so you can see by the
13:48 - way there's a bunch of things going on
13:51 - here because I let it run as a web thing
13:53 - the first time and the web thing has an
13:55 - error it's stopped but you can see the
13:57 - worker thing is just saying it worked it
13:59 - worked it worked so I don't know if 20
14:01 - seconds has passed but if I do this
14:04 - again look at the logs you can see the
14:06 - worker is still going so um I'm actually
14:09 - going to shut it off um because I have
14:11 - it set to like tweet every 20 seconds
14:13 - which is pretty often but you can see
14:15 - that this works so now my bot is
14:16 - deployed on Heroku and by the way free
14:19 - account free Heroku account um to to do
14:23 - this so um so you don't this you do not
14:25 - need a paid Heroku account to Simply run
14:28 - run a an app with a worker process so
14:31 - hopefully this was helpful to you this
14:32 - is about 15 minutes of the steps um what
14:35 - I'm going to do in the video's
14:38 - description is uh kind of paste links to
14:41 - all the pieces you need to download uh
14:44 - I'll have links to all the pieces you
14:45 - need to download I also have this thing
14:47 - that I ran through as a written tutorial
14:49 - so I will post a link to that as well um
14:52 - and uh but before I go away I'm just
14:55 - going to show you how I could shut it
14:56 - off if I want to so I could hit edit
14:58 - here I could turn this off and hit
15:00 - confirm so now my bot uh even though it
15:04 - did four more random numbers it should
15:06 - have stopped now and it won't do any
15:08 - more random numbers I've shut it off
15:10 - right now so uh that was that concludes
15:13 - our discussion of how to deploy your no
15:16 - Dutch ass bot to
15:19 - Heroku over here I'm going to
