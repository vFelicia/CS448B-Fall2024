00:00 - Okay! Hello! Here we are again. I'm standing in this video in front of a particle system.
00:06 - Circles are falling from the sky. It is quite beautiful, it is lovely, this is a
00:11 - example you will find in Processing Examples under topics Simulate Simple Particle System. Why are we looking at this?
00:17 - We know how to draw a circle on the screen.
00:20 - We call the function ellipse(). We know how to draw perhaps, a bunch of circles on the screen.
00:25 - We could say ellipse(), ellipse(), ellipse(). ellipse() ellipse() ellipse() ellipse() ellipse(), and we'd have five circles on the screen. What if we wanted to have
00:32 - several hundred circles on the screen? In that case,
00:36 - we don't want to have to write the code ellipse() a hundred times. There's an obvious solution to this. It is saying- Hey you
00:43 - know how to draw a circle? Draw that circ... this line of code draws a circle.
00:47 - Well, repeat that line of code a 100 times. So, this is what we want to learn how to do today.
00:52 - We want to understand how do we take a line of code or multiple lines of code,
00:57 - repeat them multiple times so that one concept, the singular concept of a particle falling can be done
01:03 - hundreds or thousands of times over. We're not going to get to this Particle System example yet. We'll start to see that when
01:08 - we get to Object-Oriented Programming examples. But we'll start with something simpler. So I'll leave this running there because it's a nice little effect,
01:15 - while we go over here!
01:17 - Well, hello! Okay, so we know how to write a conditional statement. A conditional statement is the clue to how
01:24 - we'll write a
01:25 - loop in this statement. So this is how we write a conditional statement - if
01:30 - some condition such as 'x'
01:33 - is less than 'width',
01:37 - execute some code.
01:39 - This is a conditional statement - if this evaluates to 'true',
01:43 - execute this code. If it evaluates to 'false', don't execute that code. Keep going. So we actually have this already
01:49 - set up in an example that I made before I started this video, but I never ran it. So hopefully this is going to work.
01:55 - We'll find out. It's good to find out. So let's run this example and
01:59 - we can see here what's happening. A circle Is moving across the screen because the value of 'x' is currently
02:05 - less than 'width', so it's incrementing it. When that's no longer true, we stop incrementing it and
02:10 - it stops, the 'x = x +1' stops happening. So that's a conditional statement. What is a
02:17 - loop? A loop. I would say 'a looping statement' but I don't think anybody says that. What is a loop?
02:21 - Well, there are two kinds of loops -  there's a 'while' loop and a 'for' loop. We're going to look first --
02:26 - I'm getting better at this back and forth thing -- at a 'while' loop. Okay.
02:30 - Notice this conditional statement - if 'x' is less than 'width',  execute this code. A 'while' loop looks like this -while
02:38 - 'x' is less than 'width',
02:43 - execute this code. Exactly the same format with a major, major, major difference. This is my way.
02:51 - Major difference. The word 'if' is here. The word 'while' is there.
02:57 - What does this 'if' ensure? This can happen, this code that's here, can happen 0 or 1
03:04 - times. It can happen 0 times if that's false, it happens once if it's true.
03:10 - How many times can this
03:12 - line, can this code occur. It can happen 0 times, it could happen one time
03:18 - It Could Happen two times, all the way to, in theory, an
03:22 - infinite number of times.
03:24 - It's going to do Maybe you will write a loop someday that will happen in Infinite Number of Times and then you will, also
03:29 - Conquer The Universe Or something but um so this is A very key Difference While this is true Continue Executing this Code
03:38 - While This is True Continuing [executes] its Code if This is true execute this code Just Once so let us Walk over and
03:44 - Now Change our if Statement to a while Statement and Let's see what happens
03:50 - I'm Walking Over I'm Turning this way and here, We are I think I'm Still in the Shot, ok?
03:54 - So i'm going to change this to a while
03:59 - And something Goofy happened With the Screen Turning Gray if I shake it Around a little bit
04:06 - Everything's Gone Wrong I'm good, oh this was good Video is going This
04:10 - Is like I feel [like] my best Video yet Now it sort of fell Apart
04:12 - [ok], we're Fine ok here, We are [let's] Look at the screen
04:17 - Now here We go while x Is less than with x equals x plus 1
04:22 - X Equals 0 Let's run This what's going to happen
04:28 - Hmm i didn't even See it Move Wait Wait Wait are You sure about that Let's run, that again run, oh
04:35 - It's Already there why
04:37 - Because it got to this Moment and it Just did this [Coat] over and over again [so] the first Time it drew the ellipse it
04:42 - Was Already at the Edge of the Screen Because it Incremented it over and Over and [over] again until it got to be With and
04:47 - Then went Down to the Bottom so this is interesting
04:50 - While x Equals x plus 1
04:54 - So so what what's Going on here, Well first
04:58 - What Would What's Really Happening here Let's Take this Code and put it inside the While loop
05:07 - Look I don't see Anything hmm what's going on There
05:12 - Interesting Question ah
05:15 - So hard to describe and I want to go back and draw something but. I want to Keep This Video Short
05:19 - This Way This Is why You Practice or you Plan in Advance
05:23 - There's A very Big Problem going, on here The first Time, We go [Through] and Shouldn't, We see x?
05:28 - Was 0 then x Is 1 Then 2 Then 3 Then 4 and Every One of Those Times, we're Drawing A?
05:31 - Circle Let's Just See circles the whole Way across that's what you might Expect?
05:34 - Well That's what Happened The first Time Through Draw. The second Time Through draw. What was the value of x With
05:40 - So, we need to Make sure With this Particular While loop
05:44 - That We Reset x back To 0 Every Time Through draw Now Look what Happened This is Interesting [Looks] Kind, of like a streak of
05:53 - Line Across the Screen Let's Change this to x Equals x plus 20
05:59 - Now, We see the Purpose of a while loop the Purpose of a while loop is to Say?
06:05 - Repeat This Code a bunch of Times How Many Times
06:09 - Well if The width IS 400 and we're Going Up by?
06:14 - 2400 Divided By 20, is like 20 so Maybe There's 20 circles Maybe There's 19
06:18 - If we're Off [by], one who knows the point is We have now?
06:22 - Successfully
06:24 - Repeated A single One Circle Many Times With one Line of [Code] I like Standing this Way Because I could point at the Code so
06:32 - How Are
06:33 - We doing this x Equals Zero While x is still less Than With Keep Drawing Circles
06:39 - The way up until x is no longer, less Than With and then
06:43 - Leave that leave leave the while loop and go back and Circle Through Draw again
06:48 - This Would be a nice Time [for] me Asking [Few] Questions but You're Not Really There
06:53 - [But] you might have a Question I guess at this Point Just email me if You have a question Whatever
06:57 - There Are some other Important Things I wanted to Say [about] this
07:01 - This Let's Just Look at this for a second what Would happen if
07:05 - Ah This is Really good this is good what Would happen if I put Mouse x in Here This Is an Interesting Question
07:13 - I'm going [to] run this Code, [oh]?
07:16 - Oh Nothing I'm Getting Nothing okay, here's the essential problem [I]?
07:24 - Forgot To put on a timer so I have no idea How long this Video has Been Said Barbara I'm sure it's Way longer Than
07:29 - I ever imagined or one
07:31 - That's okay, you, Could stop now you could
07:33 - Actually Just stop Now Going to the next Video but I'm going to say a couple of good things Hopefully so okay so?
07:39 - Let's Look at this While Loop While
07:43 - X is less [than] With
07:48 - Draw A circle At an x Location
07:55 - What if I put Here x is equal to Zero and Then I said x Equals x Minus 1
08:02 - What is the Major Problem With This Loop There is no?
08:05 - Syntactical Problem We've Got semicolons we've got Parentheses Even Curly Brackets to the right Place Everything is good but
08:11 - We have A fundamental problem with this Code x?
08:14 - Equals 0 Then x is negative 1 that's
08:16 - Less than With the Nexus Negative 2 That's Lesson with This Would get a stuck in an Infinite Loop [an]
08:21 - Infinite Loop Which Happens Forever and Ever [and] Can, Never Break out we're Never Going to get [to] end up draw
08:25 - We're Never going to See Anything loops must Always Have an Exit Condition and
08:31 - It is Up [to] you
08:35 - To Make Sure That That Exit Condition is Bet
08:38 - Logically Through the what However you
08:40 - Organize The Logical Thinking of your Code it's not Prospects not going to Say like hey
08:44 - I'm looking at your Code and you know your eggs a Condition
08:47 - Never Be met if These
08:49 - Possibilities Happen and This happens if This happens you Probably want to like Look at that again and Make Sure [you're] [right] better Code
08:53 - No it Could only view the Syntax it's fine Saying like I'll just Keep Looping that's what you told me to
08:58 - Do I'm just going to do it no problem you, won't like the result because this Is what you're Going to get so why
09:03 - Do We have an Infinite loop in Here why what, we're Saying x?
09:07 - Equals x plus
09:10 - sorry, Mouse x
09:13 - Well what Value of Mouse x Would give Us an Infinite loop?
09:18 - You might be Thinking 0 [it's] like if your Watch Dora the explorer [I] say you Shout 0 like you could talk to the TV
09:26 - Probably Not Anyway I
09:28 - Wish i could hear you Sounding 0 but?
09:30 - When the Value Is 0 x Is not going to increment it's never going to be Greater than With This is Never going False There's
09:36 - No Exit Condition so I should Just be able to move the Mouse now the value of Mouse [x] is like
09:41 - 200 right it's like it's or Around 200 Shouldn't I have my I
09:46 - Should Be Exiting my loop Now the Problem
09:48 - Is mouse x only ever Updates Once Through draw so if it was 0 iTs 0
09:53 - We're Stuck in an Infinite loop so let's Just get Ourselves out of that Problem
09:57 - We have to write better logic more Sound Logic so we don't have that Problem?
10:01 - What is the way You might get out of that Problem, well what if I?
10:05 - Say
10:07 - If Mouse x is less Than 1
10:14 - Say x Equals x plus [1]
10:17 - Otherwise
10:18 - Then it's okay so in other Words I am only?
10:23 - Allowing There's other Ways to solve This Problem but this is a nice Simple way, [of] using a, conditional Statement [Whoa], inside of loop
10:29 - We have this Is why Blocks of Code are so important?
10:31 - We have the loop Block of Code and Now?
10:33 - We have Another Block of Code Inside This Is something you have to get used to doing
10:36 - We want to Say As Long as [x] Is less than With?
10:39 - You Know and if Mouse [x] Is less [Than] 1 We better go up by?
10:42 - one so
10:42 - We meet the Exit Condition Otherwise don't worry We can go up by now Sex Because it's some positive Number Eventually
10:48 - We'll get out of the loop and here We go?
10:49 - We're Going to run this now and We can see what is exciting about this Is?
10:54 - That The Displacement between The Circles Is relative to Mouse x right here Mouse x is Probably Around
11:02 - 50 Or something so it's Probably A terrible Estimation of the Pixels but you Can see what's Happening Here and When [Mouse] [x] is Zero
11:08 - It just increments by one so
11:12 - So this is a while
