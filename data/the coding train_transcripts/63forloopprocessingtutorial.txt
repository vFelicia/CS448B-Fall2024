00:00 - Okay in this video. We are going to be talking about a for loop. Here's the thing...
00:05 - You learned about a while loop, you can actually just totally skip this video.
00:09 - You don't need a for loop. A for loop is just a
00:11 - shorthand way of writing a while loop. A certain kind of while loop that you tend to want to write over and over and over
00:17 - and over again.
00:19 - But you're going to be looking at Processing examples
00:21 - You're going to be doing things in the future that for loop is going to be convenient for you.
00:25 - So you might as well get exposed to it and use it but I should really point out that we're not adding any new
00:31 - functionality, we're just learning a shorthand way to write a while
00:36 - loop. In fact the way
00:37 - we're going to write it is perhaps a little bit more confusing than a while loop.
00:40 - but
and we're going to examine that. So that's all this video is going to be about it's about let's look at the while loop.
00:45 - Let's look at a for loop. Let's learn how to rewrite a while
00:48 - loop as a for loop and let's do that in Processing code.
00:50 - So we have the answer to one of our exercises earlier. I refactored this program just to make it a static program
00:57 - so there's no setup() and draw() anymore and all it's doing is it's saying: "Hey
01:00 - let's start x at zero and repeat x all the way to the edge of the screen. Let's start y at zero let's repeat
01:06 - y all the way to the bottom of the screen?
01:08 - That's what we're doing in this video to draw this sort of grid pattern by lines horizontally and lines vertically.
01:13 - So to do that. We know we have to say okay well first we start with x equal to zero.
01:20 - Then we say well while x is less than the width of the window.
01:28 - Draw something and increment... So draw something being the line. Sorry.
01:34 - The line. Draw the line which goes from X comma 0 to x comma height and
01:41 - then increment x by some amount I think I said 20 pixels an arbitrary choice.
01:46 - This is our while loop and gives us a line, a line, a line, a line all the way to the edge. So...
01:53 - What are the elements of this loop? There are three elements one we could say is initialization condition?
02:03 - This is where we set up, what is the thing. We're initializing it right before our loop starts. x equals zero.
02:11 - What is another thing we're doing? We have a boolean expression.
02:17 - We need to check if that boolean expression is true. If it is continue looping if it's false finish looping. What's another thing we have?
02:26 - We have an incrementation operation.
02:31 - Incrementation operation. What we're doing is we're incrementing some variable every time at the end of the loop.
02:37 - Ensuring that our exit condition is eventually met. Well a for loop takes these three common elements
02:44 - Something that you initialize, a boolean expression that you test, and something that you do at the end of the loop and allows you to
02:50 - write them all in one statement. So it looks like this
02:54 - for
02:55 - int
02:56 - x equals zero, semicolon x is less than width,
03:03 - semicolon, x equals x plus 20,
03:07 - end parentheses, curly bracket, close curly bracket. Now I have to walk up to the camera here for a second.
03:12 - Yes, that curly bracket is in the shot. You are seeing it that's wonderful. I could also come up and say: "Helllo."
03:17 - Okay
03:19 - Somebody told me to do that. And so I did it. Now I feel embarrassed and also kind of stupid.
03:23 - Okay, we'll edit that out. So here we are, look at this we have element number one is right here.
03:29 - Element number two is right here. Element number three is right here
03:33 - What's element number four well element number four is the stuff that you do inside the loop which for us is:
03:39 - draw a line.
03:44 - So you can see these two loops are
03:47 - 100% identical
03:49 - The difference is... you know....
03:52 - This allows you to stick these three lines of code next to each other on one line. It makes your code a little shorter.
03:57 - You're just saying hey the loop starts with x at zero
03:59 - We always check if x is less than width. At the end of loop we always go up by 20.
04:03 - You know in some world, which is your world if this is the first time you're learning is...
04:07 - This this is actually quite a bit more confusing
04:10 - Because this really says you know this is all happening in the order first do this then check the expression then draw the thing then
04:16 - increment. Check the expression then draw the thing then increment. Check the expression. Oh the expression is false leave the loop.
04:23 - Here I....
04:24 - Hear we're going out of order. First
04:26 - we do this, then we do this, then we do this, then we do this, then we do this again, and if that's true...
04:33 - right so it's a little bit out of order. But it will become intuitive to you
04:37 - but I would suggest as
04:38 - an exercise what you should be doing is find something you made that has a while loop in it try to rewrite it with a
04:44 - for loop get the exact same result. In fact you could do that if you want to pause right now
04:49 - you could do that with this grid example put this in your code run it. Oh wait
04:53 - why would you do that. I already did it for you, but let's just go... you can pick something else. I'll think of something
04:58 - I'll try to think of something. Let me.. ah what time... we're only at five minutes! This is a brilliant video.
05:03 - This... I'm just going to go let's go put this in and prove that this works. So
05:07 - here we have a loop for x and a loop for y which is convenient because we can see it as both a while loop.
05:12 - But what I'm going to do now just for the purpose of demonstration you probably wouldn't do this in your code because it would be
05:17 - confusing
I'm going to have one the x stays as a while. The while... the y change to a for loop and we will look at it that way. Okay, so we know that the for loop...
05:27 - The first thing we do is we need the increment... the the initialization condition, okay...
05:33 - then the boolean expression is y less than height, then the incrementation operation and
05:40 - then
05:41 - what do we do inside that loop as we draw a line. So you can see...
05:47 - these loops are
05:49 - identical principally
05:50 - identical like conceptually... principally... conceptually identical. They're doing the same thing. One for horizontal values one for vertical values.
05:57 - But you can see how this is condensed. It reads got like three lines of code
06:01 - This is one, two, three, four, five. You know if you're going to do this kind of loop over and over again
06:04 - It's nice to have the shorthand. So let's run this make sure we get the same result.
06:09 - We got the same result you know if you want a really simple... What's the easiest exercise
06:12 - I could give you take this and just convert this first one to a for loop.
06:16 - You know, actually it's not that easy. This stuff is weird. Like look at the semicolons, parentheses, with what order?
06:21 - So this will take some time for you getting used to but hopefully this gives you a sense of what we understand
06:26 - what a while loop does and what does a for what is a for loop?
06:29 - It's the same thing as a while loop
06:31 - but it is a shorthand. The while loop by the way is going to be a great deal more flex.
06:36 - You could have multiple lines of code here. You could be doing all sorts of weird stuff in here.
06:40 - This is a very specific format, which gives you three options. Okay. That is perhaps the shortest video.
06:46 - I think someone's laughing in the hallway.
06:47 - I swear, that they heard me talking to myself, and they're laughing now. Look they're laughing with me. This is very funny for all of us.
06:54 - Anyway, okay... This is the end of the video there will be another one. See you soon.
