00:01 - alright so in the previous video we
00:03 - looked at a vehicle seeking a target the
00:05 - vehicle was had singular laser vision
00:08 - focus that no matter where that target
00:10 - is I move in at maximum speed towards
00:12 - that target and what we saw is the
00:14 - vehicle to just was trying to like slam
00:17 - into that target in this case it's not
00:18 - an actual thing it's just pixels so it
00:20 - went right by it I had to turn around
00:22 - and come back and you have this back and
00:23 - forth back and forth so what if and that
00:25 - might be what you want sometimes but
00:26 - what if what you want is that vehicle to
00:29 - try to rush towards that target bone it
00:31 - gets close slow down slow down and stop
00:33 - so let's let's try to imagine how we
00:35 - might do that so okay so remember the
00:39 - key thing here is thinking about a
00:42 - vehicle's desired velocity at any moment
00:45 - in the simulation so we have our vehicle
00:49 - we have our target and what we're gonna
00:52 - do we're gonna add something here so
00:53 - before what we had before was it didn't
00:56 - matter like these could be like a whole
00:57 - bunch of vehicles I know they were
01:01 - always looking this was this was this is
01:03 - always this was an accurate
01:04 - representation of all their desired
01:06 - velocities if they're all trying to seek
01:07 - that target no matter how close they are
01:09 - to that target their desired velocity is
01:11 - that maximum speed but now we want to
01:14 - say something we want to say hey if I'm
01:17 - like over here maybe I want my maximum
01:19 - speed to be my desired velocity to be
01:22 - that desired velocity in that direction
01:25 - but but but not as fast and then when
01:28 - I'm a little closer
01:29 - even less fast Dilton when I'm closer or
01:31 - less vestal and if I'm on the target my
01:33 - desired velocity should actually be zero
01:34 - right my desired velocity should be zero
01:36 - so how are we gonna do that one way that
01:41 - we can do it is we can think of the
01:42 - target as having an invisible circle
01:46 - around it first circle if anybody's ever
01:49 - drawn it's the best I can do hi golly
01:52 - okay so this circle is an invisible
01:54 - target around it with some radius and I
01:57 - think in my example just for the sake of
01:59 - argument the radius is equal to 100
02:00 - pixels but you know you could come
02:03 - whatever you want and we could say that
02:05 - anywhere when when the vehicle is
02:07 - anywhere outside of the target so
02:09 - anywhere in here that's right outside of
02:11 - the circle anywhere anywhere anywhere
02:13 - outside of the circle its desired
02:15 - velocities magnitude is maximum speed so
02:18 - when it is here it desires to go at
02:20 - maximum speed when it is here it desires
02:22 - to go to maximum speed etc now when it's
02:24 - right on the edge it still desires to go
02:26 - in back some speed when it is right at
02:29 - the target it desires it's magnitude is
02:33 - zero here zero here maximum speed here
02:36 - so what does it when it's halfway in
02:39 - between maximum speed divided by two so
02:43 - maybe you're thinking of something here
02:45 - maybe you're thinking that hey if I
02:48 - could get the distance P vector distance
02:52 - between my location and the target then
02:58 - I could say hey the magnitude the my
03:05 - speed I'm sorry my speed my desired
03:07 - speed I could use the map function right
03:11 - I want to map that distance which is
03:13 - anywhere from zero to 100 to are
03:17 - anywhere between zero to 100 - between
03:20 - zero and maximum speeds right so the
03:26 - math function is our friend here we
03:28 - could say if it's if the distance is
03:30 - greater than R its maximum speed if it's
03:32 - less than R its some range between zero
03:35 - and maximum speed and map will give us
03:37 - will do that for us so this is a really
03:40 - fantastic solution and works very well
03:42 - I'm gonna show it to you in a second but
03:44 - well I just want to stop for a second
03:46 - and emphasize a point Craig Reynolds
03:48 - came up with this I assume that's what
03:51 - I've read I believe it to be true I
03:53 - looked at it and implemented it in
03:55 - processing and you can use it now but
03:58 - the real question isn't just to say it's
04:01 - through the before this isn't just a
04:03 - saying that this model is that what you
04:05 - should use it's this way of thinking
04:07 - you're looking at a system you're making
04:09 - choices of how your vehicle should be
04:10 - moving and you're analyzing it to
04:12 - determine okay well it needs to slow
04:14 - down so it's desired velocities get a
04:16 - based on its distance from the target
04:17 - you could come up with your own scenario
04:19 - and I probably gonna say who this way
04:20 - too many times but I think it's really
04:22 - crucial here you should be thinking
04:23 - about making up your own videos okay so
04:26 - let's take a look at how this plays out
04:28 - in code and I've actually got it right
04:30 - here already if you see the arrive
04:32 - function looks very very similar to the
04:34 - steering function but now we're just
04:35 - saying hey what's my distance if my
04:37 - distance is less than 100 set the
04:39 - magnitude using them by mapping the
04:42 - distance to to arrange which has a range
04:43 - from 0-100 doing 0 and maximum speed
04:45 - otherwise in all their cases its maximum
04:48 - speed and if I run this we will now see
04:51 - that as it reaches the target it slows
04:54 - down and stops I'm supposed to look into
04:57 - the camera because it makes these videos
04:59 - better somehow but I keep forgetting to
05:01 - do it okay all right so there two other
05:04 - things that I want to just say in this
05:07 - video one is that I think again this is
05:09 - really emphasizing the point of the
05:11 - power of this formula desired - velocity
05:14 - one of the things that you could not
05:17 - achieve with just pure gravitational
05:20 - attraction is this result because let's
05:23 - say this is the target let's say this is
05:25 - the vehicle and this is its current
05:27 - velocity and this is its desired
05:30 - velocity what we're actually saying
05:33 - remember here now is steering equals
05:35 - desired minus velocity which gives us a
05:38 - vector that points backwards so this
05:42 - this formula is so simple until elegant
05:44 - but yet it gives us a very powerful
05:45 - result in set in in that even though our
05:48 - behaviors to move towards a target that
05:50 - formula allows us to see if we're moving
05:52 - too fast that the force should actually
05:54 - push us backwards
05:55 - I think I'm repeating myself a bunch of
05:56 - times but hopefully that helps
05:58 - well here's to have this material okay
06:01 - um the other thing that just to go back
06:03 - to is to say that you could you can make
06:05 - up different scenarios for desired
06:06 - velocity and I'll just show you a couple
06:08 - that exam so this is example 6.2 if
06:11 - you're looking for where we are but you
06:13 - can also take a look at just you know
06:16 - let's say you wanted to have a steering
06:18 - behavior where an object stays on the
06:21 - screen and so here we have just this is
06:23 - not one of reynolds behaviors also
06:24 - because it's much more primitive and
06:26 - less well thought-out then all of his
06:28 - but here
06:29 - we have a vehicle's desired velocity is
06:31 - its current velocity unless unless it's
06:35 - within 25 pixels of an edge and then the
06:37 - desired velocity is velocity that points
06:38 - away from that edge and you can see how
06:40 - we can add a steering force here just to
06:42 - keep something within a rectangular
06:44 - boundary this you know if you're looking
06:46 - for an exercise try to make that happen
06:48 - you know with a circular boundary and
06:50 - there's an example just in the
06:51 - repository called stay within circle
06:53 - which you can look at here and here we
06:55 - have something else which the vehicle is
06:56 - actually looking to out into the future
06:58 - to see where it is and stay within a
07:03 - circle so I just wanted to sort of point
07:04 - out that there's a couple extra examples
07:05 - there maybe this part of the video
07:07 - should be edited out and if you're
07:09 - looking for an exercise I'm gonna give
07:11 - you one there I don't have an example
07:13 - for this it is an exercise I think in
07:15 - the book so I'll probably will implement
07:17 - it at some point but here's a nice I
07:19 - think
07:20 - exercise for you to do that also
07:23 - illustrates an important point so we
07:25 - just looked at seek and arrive right
07:28 - seek is having the desired velocity that
07:31 - points towards an actual target what if
07:34 - instead of a stationary target this is
07:37 - some other vehicle or creature that
07:39 - happens to be moving as well so if this
07:42 - vehicle is moving and this vehicle
07:44 - chooses to seek that vehicle we're
07:47 - talking about this behavior known as
07:48 - pursuit and one of the things with
07:50 - pursuit you can do is say hey I have a
07:52 - perception of my environment I know this
07:55 - object's current velocity I can predict
07:57 - that in a few moments this is actually
08:01 - where it's going to be and my desired
08:03 - velocity shouldn't be pointed towards
08:05 - its current location it should be
08:07 - pointed towards where I believe its
08:08 - future location is going to be and this
08:11 - is actually the reason I bring this up
08:12 - is we're gonna see this again and again
08:14 - in a lot of the scenarios
08:15 - particularly going to see if is in the
08:16 - past following example but this is
08:18 - something that you've seen a lot of
08:20 - Reynolds steering behaviors where
08:21 - vehicles are looking at their current
08:23 - velocity and guessing where they're
08:24 - gonna be in a moment to avoid an
08:25 - obstacle or looking at another vehicles
08:28 - velocity and guessing where it's going
08:29 - to be in a moment to avoid it or pursue
08:31 - it to evade or pursue it so in you know
08:33 - this is if you think about it if you
08:35 - were playing a game of football
08:37 - you know the American football we have
08:38 - to tackle somebody spirit
08:42 - but if I'm trying to tackle somebody and
08:43 - I see them running down the field I'm
08:45 - also gonna run down the field of trying
08:46 - to head them off so creating that type
08:48 - of behavior is something is a great
08:51 - exercise so I'm going to suggest that as
08:53 - a little mini project you could work on
08:55 - before we go on to the next video and if
08:57 - I list over here the next video we're
08:59 - going to look at a flow field so
09:01 - steering behavior following a flow field
09:03 - okay
