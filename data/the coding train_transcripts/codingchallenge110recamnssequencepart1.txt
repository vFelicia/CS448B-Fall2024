00:00 - hello in this video you're gonna see me
00:03 - do a coding challenge where I make this
00:06 - visualization this is a visualization of
00:08 - the recommen no mercy quints I'll talk
00:11 - about what that number sequence is how
00:13 - it works and then write the code to draw
00:15 - this using javascript in the p5 library
00:17 - this is all thanks to and inspired by a
00:19 - number file video which I will also
00:21 - reference and you can find links to in
00:23 - the video's description
00:24 - so I know apparently it's spooky alright
00:33 - so the idea for this coding challenge
00:35 - originates from this wonderful
00:37 - numberphile video about this thing
00:39 - called the recommendations acquits is a
00:43 - numeric sequence a sequence of numbers
00:46 - really like I keep a book that does lots
00:49 - of million random numbers in it around
00:50 - it sooo this me if suit soothe the sooth
00:53 - is me it soothes me at nighttime but I'm
00:56 - feeling stressed or anxious just to read
00:58 - some random numbers and so this
01:01 - particular number sequence is a
01:02 - fascinating one is invented by a
01:05 - Colombian mathematician named Bernardo
01:07 - recommence Antos and you can find out
01:11 - more about it at the guess what there's
01:13 - a website which is actually the online
01:16 - encyclopedia of integer sequences and I
01:18 - think now possibly for the rest of my
01:20 - life I'm just going to be at home
01:22 - browsing this website know about this
01:28 - till now so here's the thing I'm not
01:31 - going to go too much into the background
01:32 - of this numeric sequence or number
01:35 - sequences I definitely recommend that
01:37 - you also check out the numberphile video
01:39 - I'm really just gonna try to coat it and
01:40 - visualize it that's what I'm gonna do in
01:42 - this video I'm gonna do it in JavaScript
01:43 - and if I'm feeling a little saucy
01:47 - afterwards I might I might do a video
01:51 - where we try to make something musical
01:53 - out of the number sequence so anyway
01:54 - okay so what how does that let me first
01:56 - attempt to just describe to you what the
02:00 - number sequence is now for a number
02:02 - sequence is just exactly that a sequence
02:05 - of numbers like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 that's
02:09 - a integer sequence counting up by one
02:12 - there's
02:12 - Fibonacci sequence 1 1 2 3 5 8 right
02:18 - where you add the two numbers before and
02:20 - get the next of it so maybe you want to
02:22 - pause this video right now and invent
02:23 - your own number sequence this particular
02:26 - this recommen a numbered sequence is
02:28 - particularly beautiful and interesting
02:30 - as a kind of this strange balance
02:32 - between order and chaos
02:33 - so you know anything that has a nice
02:35 - this dialectic quality of having both
02:39 - order and chaos that's always
02:40 - fascinating to visualize well mostly all
02:42 - these I think all right so let's say we
02:44 - have a number line and I'm really just
02:47 - regurgitating here a bit of the
02:49 - explanation that is in the numberphile
02:51 - video in my own words
02:52 - probably not nearly as well 0 1 2 3 4 5
02:58 - 6 7 8 9 10 and this could in theory go
03:02 - on to infinity apologies there's a
03:05 - little glare there but I think
03:06 - everything would be fine all right now
03:10 - let's say I have a counter and that
03:13 - counter is going to start at 1 the idea
03:17 - here and it's going to go up 2 3 4 5 6
03:21 - now for every number in the counter I'm
03:24 - going to try to go backwards but it's
03:28 - like so I'm gonna start so I'm gonna
03:30 - start right here and I'm going to
03:32 - attempt to go backwards if I can go
03:35 - backwards by this number of spaces and
03:37 - land somewhere that hasn't been landed
03:39 - on before great I'm gonna go there if
03:42 - not I'm gonna go forward this seems
03:44 - weird and I don't really know if that
03:46 - explanation made sense but it's going to
03:47 - make sense to you if you keep watching I
03:49 - hope I think alright so one I'm gonna
03:51 - try to go backwards there's no spot
03:53 - there's no negative numbers in the
03:55 - sequence so I can't go backwards
03:56 - I'm gonna go forwards I'm gonna go to
03:58 - here so my sequence is now 0 1 now I'm
04:04 - going to go I'm gonna try to go
04:06 - backwards by 2 1 - uh nope I can't so I
04:10 - need to go forwards by 2 so I'm gonna go
04:12 - here 3 now I'm gonna try to go backwards
04:17 - by 3 1 2 3 up no that spot is take it
04:21 - that spots taken I can't go there I'm
04:24 - going too
04:26 - one two three four now I'm gonna try to
04:31 - go back four one two three guess what
04:34 - guess what this spot is open so I can go
04:37 - backwards for it now in the
04:38 - visualization of it I'm going to want to
04:41 - draw the moving backwards below in and
04:43 - this is an arbitrary decision it's sort
04:45 - of the common way to visualize this
04:46 - sequence it's certainly what's done in
04:48 - the numberphile video the point of these
04:49 - showing this choose to code it but you
04:51 - might invent your own way of visualizing
04:52 - this but I can go back for now by the
04:55 - way I forgot to keep updating this zero
04:57 - one three six two and then now I'm gonna
05:02 - go forward five no I'm gonna try to go
05:04 - backwards five I can't there's nothing
05:07 - there so I'll go forwards five one two
05:08 - three four five so now I go here so we
05:12 - can see how this goes and this is now
05:14 - now it's just double check so so on and
05:17 - so forth so I could you know I could
05:19 - keep doing this it's gonna be a bit
05:20 - easier for me to write a computer
05:22 - program to do this then for me to do
05:23 - this manually on the board first of all
05:25 - I really really hope that I didn't botch
05:27 - this so I'm gonna go check though it's
05:29 - like a PDA and see if this sequence
05:31 - matches what's there zero one three six
05:34 - two seven zero one three six two seven
05:39 - all right so let's begin it and write
05:41 - some actual code now so here I am in a
05:45 - JavaScript program with the p5.js
05:47 - library loaded I what do I need so I
05:51 - need to keep track of if I come back to
05:54 - this I need to keep track of the number
05:56 - sequence will be nice to keep track on I
05:58 - want to keep track of the counter like
06:00 - what spot of my own I need to keep track
06:02 - of which spots have been landed on or
06:06 - not alright so I'm going to say let
06:10 - numbers this will be an array that's
06:15 - going to basically have a value in it
06:19 - you know something like this for every
06:22 - spot that's been landed on that's kind
06:24 - of my idea so I'm gonna have that then
06:27 - I'm going to what else do I did I say I
06:28 - need that I needed a counter that's
06:31 - gonna start the counter is going to
06:33 - start at 1 and I guess this could like
06:38 - have true in it too
06:40 - because the zero spot by definition is
06:42 - what's been landed on at the beginning
06:44 - let's see how is that and then let me
06:48 - just say what is the sequence this will
06:52 - be the sequence
06:54 - so let's write let's let's write let's
06:57 - use the fact that p5 Luc's
07:01 - automatically with the draw loop but
07:03 - let's write a function called step so oh
07:07 - and I need to keep track of where I am
07:09 - so I guess I'm going to call that index
07:11 - because I'm think of it as the index
07:14 - into this array and so actually what I'm
07:16 - gonna do is at the beginning I'm just
07:19 - going to say numbers index equals true
07:22 - because that's where I am and every time
07:25 - I want to step the first thing I'm gonna
07:27 - do is I'm going to say num index minus
07:31 - or I'm going to say I'm gonna say next
07:33 - equals index minus count this is me
07:38 - attempting to go backwards right and
07:40 - then I will say numbers oh I will say if
07:45 - numbers next if it's been landed on or
07:52 - if next is less than 0 if next is less
07:57 - than 0 or if it's already been landed on
08:00 - then that is no good next needs to equal
08:03 - index plus count and then I can simply
08:07 - say numbers next equals true because
08:14 - that's now a spot that I've landed on
08:16 - and the sequence I can add to it the
08:21 - value next and then I can say index
08:28 - equals next so let's do this for and
08:33 - actually let me forget about draw for a
08:34 - second let's see if this algorithm works
08:37 - let's say for let a equals 0 I is less
08:40 - than 10 i plus plus step let's just do
08:45 - this 10 times and then say console dot
08:48 - log I'm sure I've made a mistake the
08:50 - sequence so this is my idea for the
08:52 - algorithm we tried
08:53 - go backwards if that is a negative
08:56 - number it's no good or if it's a place
08:58 - that's already been landed on then I
09:00 - need to go forwards I need to set the
09:02 - forward spot to be true I need to add
09:03 - that to the sequence and now that's my
09:05 - new my next spot and so I suppose in
09:08 - addition to saying numbers index it is
09:10 - zero technically the first number that's
09:13 - the question
09:14 - zero is the first number so I also want
09:17 - to say a sequence dot push index in
09:21 - setup so let's run this code and see is
09:28 - this the sequence no no no no no no no
09:34 - that is definitely wrong oh I could see
09:38 - in the chat so does that count didn't
09:40 - increment so I forgot a really crucial
09:42 - step right the whole point of this is I
09:45 - go forward once then I tried then and
09:47 - twice then three times then four times
09:49 - trying to go backwards I was always an
09:51 - increment counter so it's just going you
09:53 - know trying to go backwards once each
09:54 - time it's never going to work all right
09:55 - okay good mistake are good mistake to
09:58 - have so I am now going to say when do I
10:02 - want to do that I guess right at the end
10:03 - I just say count plus plus right I just
10:05 - want to the next time I want two steps
10:07 - that's probably count I don't know if is
10:09 - the right variable name for this could
10:11 - be like number of steps but all right
10:13 - now let's try this again and let's see 0
10:16 - 1 3 6 2 7 13 2012 21 11 0 1 3 6 2 7 13
10:24 - 2012 21 11 the next one should be 22
10:28 - let's just double-check this a little
10:30 - bit more and see if I've got 22 all
10:36 - right whoo-hoo I feel so much confident
10:39 - that at least programmed an algorithm to
10:41 - generate that number sequence so now we
10:46 - are ready to visualize it okay this is
10:49 - the fun part
10:50 - that's all the fun part for yeah any of
10:52 - its the fun part for you alright so
10:55 - let's think about this so one thing I'm
10:56 - going to do is I'm going to take this
10:58 - out of setup and I'm going to put the
11:01 - step function in draw and let's just say
11:06 - console dot log
11:07 - index so we can see if this is kind of
11:10 - doing what I expected to do yes so this
11:12 - is the sequence now this is the rickum
11:14 - on sequential and going and going you
11:16 - see the numbers are getting bigger and
11:17 - bigger and bigger over time because I'd
11:18 - count value is always increasing alright
11:21 - okay so I'm gonna take out this
11:23 - console.log refresh now what do I want
11:27 - to do now each time I need to draw write
11:31 - what I want to do is draw an ellipse
11:33 - right so let's say I'm trying to draw an
11:36 - arc actually let's say I'm trying to
11:37 - draw this one here between 3 & 6
11:40 - well I know that the I could use the
11:42 - ellipse function the ellipse function
11:46 - and I need an X or Y in the diameter so
11:50 - the X the Y is gonna just be a fixed is
11:55 - I'm gonna do this plot this on basically
11:56 - a horizontal number line the X is going
11:59 - to be the 4.5 these start plus the N
12:03 - divided by 2 right the center and the
12:05 - diameter of this circle again this is
12:07 - just a way to visualize it maybe you
12:09 - want to do it a totally different way
12:11 - the R will be an ellipse with diameter
12:14 - of 6 minus 3 the end the next minus the
12:18 - start so if we think about this what I'm
12:21 - what I what's important here if I'm
12:23 - going to do the drawing right here the
12:26 - diameter is next
12:29 - - index the x-value is sorry the x-value
12:38 - is what did I say next plus index
12:42 - divided by 2 this is assuming there's
12:45 - one pixel per one pixel per number and
12:49 - then I could draw an ellipse
12:53 - I'm just gonna draw a full ellipse now
12:54 - at X the Y is I'm just at the Y at 0 and
12:57 - with this diameter okay so let's see
13:03 - what happens
13:04 - let me add a stroke of 255 no fill and
13:08 - let me just see if what happens if these
13:12 - ellipses start appearing and the other
13:13 - thing that I should probably do is right
13:15 - oh I should just make the Y the middle
13:18 - of the window okay so
13:20 - and actually you know what I'm gonna do
13:21 - well that's fine this is fine this is
13:23 - fine okay we hit refresh and we can see
13:26 - okay circles are appearing so this I
13:28 - think this is already somewhat
13:30 - interesting that you can see this
13:31 - pattern that's emerging just from
13:33 - visualizing the the recommend sequence
13:36 - on a number line between 0 and 600 and
13:39 - eventually we won't see anything anymore
13:41 - because the numbers are getting way too
13:42 - big but let's try to make this a little
13:45 - bit more interesting and so I actually
13:48 - misspoke earlier I had watched the
13:51 - numberphile video earlier today and in
13:53 - some reason in my head I was thinking if
13:55 - I'm going forward I'm gonna go on the
13:57 - top if I'm going backwards I'm gonna go
13:59 - along the bottom and I think actually
14:01 - what what the comp that standard
14:03 - visualization are the one that's in that
14:04 - video is just alternating so I go
14:06 - forward I go forward I go look sorry I
14:11 - go sorry alternate I go forward above
14:15 - then if I'm going forward I go forward
14:16 - below then if I'm going backwards so
14:18 - it's always this could it's more of a
14:20 - continuous loop so let me try to
14:24 - implement that so one thing first of all
14:26 - is what if I just want to draw the top
14:29 - of the circle the arc above the number
14:32 - line or below the number line well this
14:33 - is actually easy thing for me to do I
14:35 - can just change to using the arc
14:37 - function instead of ellipse I'm going to
14:40 - have to specify both the width and the
14:42 - height but now at the end of this I get
14:46 - to have a start and an end angle so if I
14:49 - say between zero and 2pi that's between
14:51 - zero and 360 degrees that's the entire
14:54 - circle so this this should look exactly
14:56 - the same but now if I were to say just
14:59 - go from zero to PI we can see here look
15:03 - I'm always getting just the bottom now
15:06 - if I were to go from PI down to zero I
15:12 - am getting the top so what I can do is I
15:17 - can say if count modulus two equals zero
15:22 - do it one way otherwise do it the other
15:26 - way and there's probably more it might
15:27 - be like a more elegant way of doing this
15:29 - but this should be fine so let's I think
15:31 - I want to start well the first one count
15:34 - is one and so that should be going I
15:38 - think I want to do it this way I want
15:39 - the first one to be over the top so now
15:42 - we can see there we go
15:44 - so this I believe should match precisely
15:48 - the circle starts with down up someone's
15:52 - telling me okay so let's try I mean
15:56 - let's try with count up once again this
16:02 - should be precisely the algorithm of a
16:07 - visualization that you find in that
16:09 - numberphile video if I got something
16:11 - wrong I'm sure I'll hear about it in the
16:12 - comments please let me know alright so
16:14 - this probably should be the end of the
16:16 - video and I should be now giving you
16:17 - some exercises but I kind of so you
16:20 - should pause right now and try something
16:21 - if you're following along couch what if
16:24 - like right now this I'm only seeing the
16:26 - results here because I'm layering each
16:28 - ellipse over and over again but what if
16:31 - I want to animate or change the scale
16:33 - like what if I want to sort of shrink
16:35 - the space as I'm drawing more and more
16:38 - circles I'm gonna need to store all of
16:40 - these arcs in some sort of data
16:42 - structure so I'm actually gonna do that
16:44 - right now just to add a little bit more
16:46 - to this video and then I'll give you
16:47 - some other ideas of things you could try
16:49 - to do at the end so what I want to add
16:51 - to this is I want to create another
16:53 - array I'm just gonna call it arcs and
16:55 - I'm actually going to create an arc
16:57 - class I'm gonna use a little
16:58 - object-oriented programming so what
17:00 - makes up a particular arc well it has it
17:08 - has a start and it has an end and it has
17:10 - a direction so I'm gonna say this dot
17:14 - start equals start this dot end equals
17:18 - end and this dot direction equals
17:21 - direction so then all this drawing thing
17:26 - or I could take all of this drawing
17:28 - stuff and put it in a function in the
17:32 - object called show and the difference
17:34 - would be this would be saying this dot
17:35 - and minus this dot start oh you know
17:38 - what I should be doing the end can be
17:42 - this is a little bit this kind of worked
17:44 - by accident but this should really be
17:45 - absolute value right because
17:48 - the end could be before the start this
17:50 - would be a negative number I think p5
17:51 - doesn't really care it's like negative
17:53 - diameter is the same as a positive
17:54 - diameter but that's probably better for
17:56 - me to put this in here and then I'm just
17:58 - going to say if Direction equals zero I
18:01 - have the direction be 0 or 1 X is also
18:05 - this dot n plus this dot start divided
18:09 - by 2 and so this should be good now and
18:13 - so what I want to do here is create a
18:17 - arc between index and next with the
18:23 - direction that is what did I say count
18:25 - modulus 2 okay so this is what I want to
18:29 - create I want to say arcs push a and
18:33 - then in draw I can now set the
18:37 - background in draw and I'm just going to
18:40 - say for let um all the arcs I'll just
18:44 - call it a of arcs a dot show so this
18:47 - should be I did this kind of quickly but
18:50 - basically if what I did is I just took
18:52 - the drawing code that I was doing kind
18:54 - of like live as the algorithm was going
18:57 - and I encapsulated the idea of drawing
18:59 - one of these arcs in an object and then
19:02 - I build up a big array of them so now I
19:03 - have this big array and every time
19:05 - through draw I want to draw everything
19:07 - in that array and this is going to allow
19:08 - probably you if okay Direction is not
19:10 - defined this has to be but I forgot the
19:23 - fist on obviously all right so this
19:25 - should be exactly what we had before but
19:28 - here's the thing
19:29 - now this is actually an animation so let
19:32 - me try something what I have this idea
19:33 - which is I want to actually scale scale
19:39 - the visualization according to how far I
19:42 - am in the sequence so for example what
19:44 - I'm going to do now is I'm actually I
19:46 - think it might help to draw the arc
19:48 - everything centered around the left side
19:52 - of the screen so I'm going to draw the
19:54 - arc at 0 in draw I'm going to say I'm
19:59 - going to say translate
20:02 - zero height divided by two and then I'm
20:04 - gonna use scale so the scale function
20:07 - for example if I were to say scale like
20:09 - five that's gonna draw everything at
20:12 - five times the size at five hundred
20:14 - percent so you can see it's already like
20:16 - thicker and bigger at the start if I
20:18 - were to say scale zero point one you can
20:23 - see everything is really really tiny now
20:25 - it's being drawn at ten percent so what
20:27 - I want the scale to be right I have a
20:30 - window that is six hundred pixels wide
20:33 - and so that each pixel is one number in
20:38 - the number sequence
20:39 - I want the whole number line if I've
20:41 - done five numbers I want that to be the
20:43 - width so I think I can actually just say
20:45 - scale with divided by count that should
20:47 - do it
20:48 - whoops yeah so now you can see it is
20:53 - like live adjusting itself
20:56 - - how many numbers I've done so far and
20:59 - let us let me give myself there's really
21:03 - no reason let me give myself the full is
21:06 - this how I do this in p5 the full window
21:09 - width and height and let me actually
21:11 - also say style body oh boy I do not know
21:16 - CSS margin zero it's not gonna do it I
21:21 - just don't want to have any padding is
21:24 - this does this call and go here no : no
21:28 - : there we go
21:30 - no : guess what this video is not over
21:33 - yet I realize in the chat I got the
21:35 - comment which is I can't believe I
21:37 - didn't think of myself which I actually
21:39 - I can because I never think of these
21:40 - things well I really shouldn't be
21:41 - scaling to the to the where the in where
21:46 - the count is I should be scaling to
21:48 - what's the biggest number that's been
21:51 - been part of the sequence so far what is
21:53 - the end of one of these circles I'm not
21:55 - actually seeing the full sequence right
21:57 - now so if I go back into my code and I
22:00 - add something which we just did if I
22:02 - have a variable called biggest equals
22:04 - zero then what I can do is each time
22:06 - through step I can check it's basically
22:09 - if index is greater than the biggest
22:12 - number
22:13 - then I want biggest to be that new index
22:17 - and then here I want to scale not by the
22:19 - count but by the biggest number so let
22:22 - me add that in hit refresh and you can
22:25 - see now I know I max this is what I
22:27 - meant to show you this is now I believe
22:29 - the visualization that you will find in
22:33 - the numberphile video so what can you do
22:35 - I hope you will make your own creative
22:37 - twist on this you can think about
22:40 - different ways of visualizing this
22:42 - besides just arcs you could think about
22:44 - using color you could think about
22:46 - putting this in 3d space I mean what
22:48 - would the z-axis mean in terms of
22:50 - visualizing this I would love to see it
22:53 - animate right now it is currently just
22:56 - you know this stamp of each ellipse one
22:58 - at a time
22:59 - what if you drew animate the full of its
23:02 - arc one at a time what if you animate
23:04 - that arc so ship make those exciting
23:08 - different versions of them share them
23:10 - with me on Twitter hashtag coding
23:13 - recommen and there's also if you look at
23:16 - the coding train dot the coding train
23:18 - calm web page that's in this video
23:20 - subscription there's a place with
23:21 - instructions of how you can submit your
23:23 - own version of this there as well okay
23:25 - so I hope you enjoyed this coding
23:26 - challenge I'm going to come back in a
23:27 - moment and I'm going to do one more
23:29 - version of this but instead of
23:31 - visualizing it I'm going to play it as
23:33 - musical notes and those musical notes
23:36 - are will sounds like something I forgot
23:39 - what I was talking about and this is
23:41 - also something that's in the numberphile
23:42 - video and I thought it'd be worth
23:42 - exploring the p5 sound library as well
23:44 - alright see you soon
23:48 - [Music]
