00:00 - good Friday morning hello it is me dan
00:05 - Shipman again on the coding training
00:08 - this train has been very busy this week
00:11 - this is actually my third live stream if
00:15 - you can believe that
00:15 - I have my water here ready with me that
00:19 - will help I'm gonna move it over here
00:24 - though just to get it out of the way so
00:27 - I've been kind of live streaming quite a
00:29 - bit extra this week simply because I
00:31 - missed a few weeks in in the last couple
00:34 - months this will not be a regular
00:36 - occurrence I feel so sleepy I start over
00:43 - let me start over
00:48 - hello it's Friday morning Here I am in
00:52 - New York City
00:53 - live on the coding train the third live
00:55 - stream of this week I will be back
00:57 - hopefully twice next week as well once
00:59 - on Monday let me just quickly mention
01:01 - because if you happen to be in the New
01:03 - York City area you could come to this in
01:04 - person if I go to ITP NYU dot edu slash
01:08 - show this is the information about the
01:13 - ITP winter show which is a two-day
01:15 - exhibition of recent creative
01:17 - interactive projects by the students at
01:19 - ITP it's happening Sunday and Monday on
01:22 - Monday hopefully around 3 p.m. hopefully
01:25 - I'm gonna loud noises coming from the
01:28 - hallway 3 p.m. I'm hoping to do a live
01:31 - stream from my mobile device and walk
01:33 - around and look at some projects so stay
01:36 - tuned for that then I will be doing a
01:40 - obsessiveness all this stuff is
01:42 - important for me to mention I'm going to
01:45 - close all these windows alright so uh so
01:52 - and then I will be back also for on
01:55 - Thursday December 21st I expect this
01:58 - will start around 11 a.m. but I'm not
02:01 - sure about the time yet I will post that
02:03 - soon for the end of year coding train
02:06 - holiday extravaganza fundraiser for the
02:09 - processing foundation so if you haven't
02:11 - made your membership donation to the
02:13 - process
02:13 - Foundation hold off or you can make it
02:16 - now if you want but oh wait and you can
02:17 - do it live and I'll I don't know maybe
02:19 - I'll read the people names as they
02:21 - donate to processing foundation okay if
02:24 - you are so able to so this is a list of
02:26 - some stuff that I want to do today I
02:28 - will be here till about 12:45 p.m.
02:30 - Eastern time that's about two hours from
02:32 - now
02:33 - really what I'm attempting to do here in
02:36 - as I approach the end of 2017 is two
02:40 - things one is kind of catch up and wrap
02:42 - up a bunch of things that I wasn't able
02:44 - to get to and I do have this list here
02:46 - for example where's this ah I want this
02:53 - is some stuff from yesterday that I
02:54 - didn't get to that I want to talk about
02:56 - to see if we can do today in terms of
02:57 - WebGL I've been kind of going through
02:59 - the rainbow topics github repository and
03:06 - kind of looking at what things have a
03:07 - lot of thumbs up and see if I can get
03:09 - through like because what I would like
03:11 - to do next Thursday is just only coding
03:13 - challenges so I'm hoping next Thursday
03:14 - will just be a series of coding
03:16 - challenges maybe you can get through
03:17 - three or four and in between I will plug
03:20 - the processing foundation so let me
03:27 - think so what but I have a couple things
03:29 - I want to go over but while I'm waiting
03:30 - what I would be curious for all of you
03:33 - I'm gonna go here and look at so what I
03:37 - did this morning really quickly is I
03:39 - went through the list of challenges and
03:42 - I found some that I thought could be
03:43 - things that I would try to do like image
03:45 - stippling this not challenged looks cool
03:47 - ASCII art generator we're to vet and
03:50 - these some of these are also like topics
03:51 - some more get github topics working with
03:53 - electron so if any of you are if anybody
03:57 - if you want like go and go log on to
04:00 - github you can go to any of you let's
04:01 - say you really want me to try to do
04:02 - image stippling if you click on this
04:05 - link you could add a reaction here so
04:08 - I'm gonna add a reaction here opes no
04:09 - wait I took my reaction away I've had a
04:11 - reaction there and I'm kind of looking
04:13 - at these numbers
04:15 - Roman numeral one asked what do you
04:17 - think about that neural network stuff so
04:19 - that is coming first thing in January
04:21 - 2018 that's as soon as I'm back in 2018
04:25 - don't know when the first live stream
04:26 - will be
04:27 - time after January first I am going to
04:29 - tackle more machine learning and neural
04:31 - network topics that's what's coming oh
04:35 - my goodness dan dan mr. dan in the chat
04:40 - my name is also mr. dan although I don't
04:42 - know that anyone's ever called me mr.
04:44 - dan is sharing the live stream right now
04:46 - with a group of seventh graders hello
04:48 - seventh graders somewhere at some school
04:51 - watching this oh I have to pick this
04:52 - educational now I was gonna do all my
04:55 - ridiculous wasting time stuff okay so
04:57 - actually while I am doing my ridiculous
05:00 - wasting while I am waiting to get
05:02 - started there's a there's a couple
05:03 - things I want to mention number one is
05:05 - we're project for awesome let's take a
05:10 - look at this this is something that's
05:12 - just started today today is December
05:14 - 15th it is online creators decreasing
05:17 - world can I say suck on YouTube week
05:22 - that out somebody I'm sure it's mine
05:24 - but and I believe this fundraiser is
05:27 - current is from what I understand the
05:30 - current the fundraiser it the donations
05:32 - now at the moment are going to save the
05:33 - children and Partners in Health but a
05:35 - lot of other great charities and I am
05:38 - going to right now well the livestream
05:40 - is not going on but I'm going to donate
05:42 - so this is one thing that I wanted to do
05:44 - I'm going to hit back it let's pick this
05:48 - $60 one why not wait I need to login no
05:53 - wait okay hold on I have an indiegogo
05:55 - account I'm sure hold on hold on
05:57 - everybody
06:03 - hold on there we go
06:05 - I'm gonna you're gonna have to look at
06:06 - this while I enter in my my my credit
06:13 - card details come on boy this is really
06:16 - exciting refitting livestream I swear
06:18 - okay I forgot my password i have an
06:22 - indiegogo account i should have looked
06:24 - at this in advance what's the chance
06:26 - that's gonna work hold on give me one
06:28 - more chance
06:29 - let me need to sign up i will just sign
06:32 - up i'm typing in my email I'm making up
06:36 - a password email has already been taken
06:39 - how about
06:40 - I'm gonna come back and finish this
06:43 - dubnation
06:43 - I don't want to waste your time would be
06:47 - trying to figure out my I should have
06:48 - looked at this in advance but I'm gonna
06:51 - I'm gonna finish my donation later so I
06:54 - will let me just try one okay anyway but
06:58 - uh at the end of the livestream I will
07:00 - complete this I did I changed my t-shirt
07:04 - from yesterday but I'm still wearing my
07:06 - same hoodie here okay so let's think
07:12 - about what it is that I'm going to do
07:16 - today ah some other things I wanted to
07:17 - look at two things I wanted to update on
07:20 - one is let me go to p5.js on github
07:24 - because we filed a github issue at the
07:28 - end of yesterday's livestream and let's
07:32 - take a look at it so this was the github
07:38 - issue we filed on yesterday's livestream
07:40 - which is that only in the code currently
07:43 - only woops only what did I click on
07:47 - there only the last light source is
07:50 - active and it should look like this if I
07:52 - have a blue light on the left and a red
07:53 - light on the right and some people took
07:57 - a look and found out that this code like
08:00 - for example here we go this code calling
08:04 - point light multiple times only as a
08:05 - single uniform location so thank you to
08:08 - this particular user here who added some
08:11 - more thoughts and we can see there's a
08:13 - lot of thumbs up and some hearts and so
08:15 - everyone that's follow this github issue
08:17 - and hopefully soon it will get fixed
08:19 - okay so I wanted to highlight that but
08:21 - there's some more information I'd been
08:23 - posted there if anybody wants to take a
08:24 - look at that the other thing I wanted to
08:27 - highlight ah so I released a video this
08:29 - morning about the for of loop so let's
08:34 - go we don't need to watch that video but
08:36 - I wanted to I'm gonna want to look at
08:39 - some of the comments so first of all
08:41 - here's one comment isn't this just for
08:44 - each so yes that is a good point let's
08:48 - see what these replies say works
08:51 - slightly differently for
08:54 - each loop over key value pairs for each
08:55 - loop gives you a callback function that
08:57 - also has an index so a for each loop is
08:59 - actually a sort of more sophisticated
09:01 - set of possibilities and so I liked for
09:06 - of in its simplicity
09:10 - this also note the fort in loop is
09:14 - something that you can use like for of
09:16 - but it loops through keys in an object
09:18 - and I wanted to somebody mentioned
09:21 - something about performance which I
09:25 - don't see here at the moment that I
09:27 - wanted to read I thought seemed like a
09:28 - useful concept looking here ah yes so
09:34 - let's look at this comment here is
09:37 - please keep in mind that these abstract
09:39 - functions have a greater impact on
09:41 - performance for example for of is eighty
09:43 - percent slower than a regular for loop
09:45 - I don't know we'd be interesting to
09:46 - benchmark that to see if that's really
09:48 - true this is something you don't need to
09:50 - take into account always but there are
09:53 - cases where performance is everything so
09:54 - I just wanted to point that out maybe I
09:55 - will pin this comment right now if we
09:57 - think this is oh no I'm not logged in as
09:59 - myself so I have the ability to pin a
10:02 - comment so often if there's a really
10:03 - helpful quick clarification of something
10:07 - that I got wrong or expansion of
10:09 - something that I did sort of missed I
10:10 - can pin that comment to the top so I
10:12 - just wanted to thank everybody for their
10:14 - comments on this video yes so people are
10:18 - complaining that I was trying to type in
10:22 - some really short password I actually
10:23 - the thing is I use one I use a password
10:26 - aggregator I don't know if that's the
10:28 - right password manager that's the right
10:29 - term and all my passwords are 12
10:31 - characters they're all a combination of
10:33 - letters numbers and symbols I was just
10:35 - thinking well maybe did I ever sometimes
10:37 - I still have these historical old
10:38 - passwords on sites I signed up for a
10:40 - long time ago and so I don't have my one
10:42 - password up so I could look at it up on
10:44 - my phone I I'm not prepared to log into
10:47 - accounts during a live stream for a very
10:49 - specific reason that's definitely
10:50 - something I don't want to do by accident
10:51 - like live streaming something that I'm
10:54 - not important but how that SpaceX launch
10:57 - do any updates on that so anyway I
11:03 - I use one password I'm open to other
11:07 - suggestions for other password managers
11:09 - that's the one that I happen to use okay
11:11 - so let's talk about what it is we're
11:13 - gonna do today so I feel like I would
11:17 - like to start with create graphics if I
11:22 - come over here for a second things that
11:28 - I also could potentially look at is
11:30 - loading a 3d model if anybody has an obj
11:35 - file family-friendly obj file that like
11:39 - a train or a rainbow or not the teapot
11:43 - you know something that I could use a
11:45 - little cute character for the simple one
11:47 - I would love to make a tutorial that
11:49 - looks at loading one of those files in
11:51 - p5 so anybody in the YouTube chat could
11:55 - share a link and then anybody in that
11:57 - chat could maybe repost that link in a
11:59 - slack Channel I would like to maybe look
12:03 - at begin shape end shape with textures
12:06 - to see how that works because uh thank
12:09 - you - Bram in the patron group who sent
12:14 - me some code to help with that
12:16 - and I really want to look at create
12:17 - graphics as a texture and how crea
12:21 - graphics works and then if there's time
12:23 - I might do a straw poll to see if I can
12:25 - get to one of the coding challenges that
12:27 - all that I'm sort of compiling as
12:29 - possibilities for next week so that's my
12:31 - plan
12:33 - ooh train toy 3d model thank you Bram ok
12:38 - so that looks actually pretty great I
12:43 - just want what's the license on that
12:45 - would be the question I'm not in the
12:47 - right view ok you have Jihan asks says
12:51 - I'm ten minutes late what if I missed
12:53 - nothing
12:54 - you missed me attempt to donate to a
12:56 - good cause I'm going to I will finish
13:00 - that donation and maybe tweet a
13:03 - screenshot of my donation to plug it as
13:05 - well later just so you guys keep me
13:07 - honest here I don't want to say I'm
13:09 - gonna donate to something and nothing
13:10 - last pass is also being suggested okay
13:15 - so let's let me start today with looking
13:19 - at create graphics
13:20 - so this is let me go to my usual
13:27 - technique of just going to the desktop
13:31 - and using the p5 manager to generate a
13:36 - bundle I'm gonna call this off I'm gonna
13:41 - call this create growl just call Korea
13:44 - graphics and then oh no that's not - Jie
13:51 - is Jen Oh p5 maybe I just say - gp5 G
13:56 - yeah that generated a create graphic
13:58 - sketch and then I can run a little
14:01 - server and I can go oh and I'm already
14:05 - doing that because I have stuff open
14:07 - already let's close this oh no don't
14:12 - quit all of terminal oh I'm the worst
14:18 - create graphics let's run my server and
14:23 - let's open this up and Adam oh you know
14:27 - there's a way I should really like I
14:29 - there's kind of some things I like to do
14:31 - to like adjust the template and I should
14:34 - just put those permanently in my p5
14:36 - manager so let's just make sure I've got
14:44 - a sketch going now create graphics is a
14:47 - function in p5 that allows you to create
14:51 - an off-screen canvas that you can draw -
14:53 - and one of the reasons you might want to
14:55 - do this is let's say you have a program
14:57 - you've created sketch you've created
14:59 - where you're kind of drawing a trail but
15:02 - you also want to have something animate
15:03 - on top of that and you're drawing the
15:05 - trail by not erasing the background but
15:07 - the thing that's animating on top of
15:08 - that shouldn't have a trail well you can
15:12 - create two separate kind of rendering
15:14 - contexts and layer them and more than
15:17 - that so I could just do this as a
15:18 - tutorial I think that's what I'm leaning
15:20 - towards and this will probably go in
15:21 - like the additional topics even though
15:23 - that's kind of exploding with the videos
15:24 - but there could be a coding challenge
15:27 - associated with this as well I will be
15:30 - doing a little more in WebGL one of the
15:31 - reasons why I'm doing this is because
15:33 - I want to show you how you can then use
15:34 - a 2d context with create graphics as a
15:37 - texture in a 3d world which I think it's
15:39 - kind of exciting I will be here live
15:42 - deston asks how how long were you plan
15:44 - on this livestream about another hour
15:45 - and 40 minutes I would say so let's make
15:48 - sure let me close all this stuff
15:55 - everybody remind me later say hey did
15:58 - you did you finish your project for
16:00 - awesome donation okay so this is there
16:04 - this is here just gonna quickly see
16:09 - does anybody have does anybody have any
16:22 - suggestions about I think I'm gonna just
16:25 - do a simple drawing program with
16:28 - something that animates on top of it I
16:29 - think that's kind of the most useful way
16:32 - of showing this okay all right
16:46 - Oh fun fun function I just got a YouTube
16:52 - alert teaching programming to children
16:54 - and teachers fun fun form spotlight if
16:57 - you don't watch the fun fun function
16:58 - channel I highly suggest you do it's
17:00 - great check great YouTube channel all
17:03 - right I could draw a pen that's
17:04 - interesting
17:05 - good good good idea Alka okay so let's
17:08 - get started
17:08 - I was trying to do my warmup
17:13 - stretch everybody stretch everybody if
17:15 - you're watching and your treat your
17:16 - computer hunched over like this get up
17:19 - stretch jog and play all right are you
17:32 - loose your body around did now you're
17:36 - ready to program hello this is a
17:43 - tutorial video for p5.js about a
17:45 - particular function a function I really
17:47 - love called crea graphics and I kind of
17:50 - shock that I haven't made this video yet
17:52 - because this is one of the classic
17:54 - things that comes up in every single
17:55 - intro programming graphics course that
17:59 - I've ever taught so let's take a look at
18:00 - that problem so let's say I'm just I
18:02 - just learned to program and I'm making a
18:05 - very simple sketch where what I want to
18:07 - do is I want to say if mouse is pressed
18:12 - draw draw an ellipse at Mouse X mouse Y
18:19 - and make that ellipse 64 pixels in
18:24 - diameter and make that ellipse white
18:27 - with a stroke of white alright so this
18:31 - is a very simple sketch all it's doing
18:33 - is when I press the mouse I'm gonna draw
18:35 - an ellipse now notice that background
18:37 - isn't set up so here's what I'm doing
18:42 - now let's say what I want to do is I
18:46 - want to see it I want to see also
18:49 - something animate over top of this you
18:51 - know an example that of that could be
18:53 - like I want to actually draw something
18:55 - well let's just do that right now what
18:56 - if I wanted to draw Alko suggested this
18:58 - in the chat draw
18:59 - or something where the mouse is so let's
19:03 - let's just have a another circle
19:06 - stand-in for that pen so I'm gonna make
19:08 - a circle that's a that's a different
19:10 - color and a little bit smaller
19:13 - also at Mouse X mouse why it's always
19:17 - going to be there because and maybe it
19:21 - changes color or something when I click
19:22 - the mouse I don't know but let's okay so
19:25 - I'm gonna put that other circle there
19:26 - oh well that's whoa whoa okay so this is
19:31 - no good because I'm drawing the
19:33 - background and set up everything
19:35 - everything everything across a trail I
19:39 - never erased that background how could I
19:41 - have something that I'm drawing to not
19:45 - erase the background and something that
19:48 - I'm drawing where I do erase the
19:50 - background
19:50 - well great graphics is the answer to
19:55 - this question what create graphics does
19:57 - is it allows you to make this this
19:59 - canvas this thing right here I can make
20:02 - when I say create canvas I've made this
20:05 - what create graphics does is it actually
20:07 - makes another canvas the only thing
20:09 - that's different it's the canvas in the
20:10 - computer's mind you don't see it it's
20:13 - stored in memory so I'm gonna say this
20:17 - I'm gonna say whoops let's call this
20:22 - I don't often call it canvas but let me
20:24 - what's another set of canvas context
20:27 - graphics I'm just gonna call this a
20:28 - graphics and I'm going to say in setup
20:32 - graphics equals create graphics and I'm
20:35 - gonna also make it 400 by 300 now what
20:39 - I'm going to do is whenever I want to
20:42 - draw onto that off screen thing in the
20:45 - computer's mind I'm going to say graphic
20:48 - stock background and if mouse is pressed
20:51 - graphics fill graphics dot stroke
20:54 - graphics dot ellipse so anything that I
20:58 - want to draw to that off-screen canvas
21:01 - that's not the one that I see I can now
21:03 - reference it and again graphics is my
21:06 - made-up variable name this could be
21:07 - kitten canvas kitten graphics whatever
21:10 - it is I've just created this off-screen
21:12 - okay so now let's refresh this whoa
21:15 - what's going on here I don't see it so
21:17 - you have to remember just because you
21:19 - draw something doesn't mean it's there
21:22 - and you see it once you've made this
21:24 - off-screen canvas you have to explicitly
21:26 - add it to the screen so I'm gonna do
21:29 - that now how do I do that I'm going to
21:32 - say image graphics zero zero so the way
21:37 - that you take an off-screen canvas and
21:39 - place it you is with the image function
21:41 - as if it was like a JPEG you loaded it's
21:43 - the same thing it's a rectangle of
21:45 - pixels of some size with some stuff
21:47 - happening in it all right so let's look
21:48 - at this now and we can see look at that
21:50 - so now and now look whoa what's going on
21:53 - so this is the sad truth the sad truth
21:57 - is I've run afoul of the world that we
22:01 - live in today
22:01 - Oh back in the day when I used to
22:04 - program with the snow up to here we
22:06 - didn't have these screens with multiple
22:09 - disel densities and high blah blah blah
22:13 - retina this and high density this
22:15 - there's a little bit of an issue going
22:16 - on which is that I am working with a
22:20 - high density display and so in that case
22:23 - there's actually four pixels for
22:25 - everyone and it's kind of mismatched
22:27 - what's happening in the off-screen
22:28 - buffer the off-screen canvas and that
22:30 - the on-screen one so I'm gonna have to
22:32 - do something just to fix this right now
22:36 - I hope this doesn't happen to you I'm
22:37 - just gonna say pixel density one so I
22:39 - would say hey whatever its kind of
22:40 - screen you're on just ignore that and
22:42 - just have a regular pixel density of one
22:45 - and that should hopefully fix this and
22:47 - you can see it did so you can see now
22:49 - that I have this animating circle and I
22:53 - have the background canvas and there is
22:57 - another way I could have fixed that by
22:58 - the way I could have I've not had a
23:01 - pixel then it becomes a point that image
23:09 - as I draw it why did that not work or
23:13 - I'll have to investigate that alright
23:15 - let me go back to pixels head city one
23:17 - now here's what's interesting so you
23:19 - have to remember I have now drawn
23:21 - something that is a completely time out
23:25 - for a second
23:40 - I'm getting some good suggestions omits
23:44 - set image graphics yeah hold on hold on
23:51 - let's take a look this is a little bit
23:53 - of an aside but Eric in the chat is
23:58 - mentioning an example let's just I was
24:01 - curious to compare I'm gonna come back
24:03 - to what I was doing I just got
24:05 - distracted for a second
24:08 - oops I must have typed in something
24:10 - wrong versa Tillis github dot u slash P
24:16 - five examples OSB OS B whoops ah must be
24:24 - with cursor is there space in this URL
24:27 - yeah it is okay Oh interesting cool so
24:31 - you can see another this is a nice
24:32 - little example that from Eric in the
24:36 - chat okay thanks everybody thanks for
24:38 - bearing with me I just was curious um
24:39 - take a look at that this is great so
24:40 - this is the kind of stuff I imagine
24:41 - people making it what I want to come
24:44 - back to this but let me just investigate
24:47 - this display density thing it frustrated
24:50 - me why did that not work oh I would have
25:03 - to make it double the size mmm that's
25:10 - weird
25:18 - hmm that's interesting oh wait no I'm on
25:20 - pixel density 1 still there we go so
25:28 - that's what I could also do that
25:32 - interesting all right hold on so let me
25:36 - show this
25:46 - I don't know if you can now I don't know
25:49 - if you can see this but I did lose a
25:51 - little bit of quality and in terms of
25:53 - the rendering quality actually you're
25:56 - not gonna see this because this is
25:57 - outputting through HDMI and that is not
26:00 - a high-density output anyway the point
26:01 - is though if you didn't want to use
26:03 - pixel density one you could actually
26:06 - help shoot everybody hold on let me try
26:10 - this again
26:23 - if you didn't want to use pixel density
26:25 - one because your sin of losing some
26:28 - quality or something that was really
26:28 - important that you're doing
26:30 - you could also not say pixel density one
26:33 - double the number of pixels for the
26:36 - off-screen graphics in other words for
26:37 - the the default canvas is going to be
26:40 - handle for you but now I could double
26:42 - those pixels and then shrink them down
26:45 - when I show them and I think this would
26:48 - then it's the same thing but I've
26:49 - retained it's hard for you to see this I
26:51 - don't know if you can see this see the
26:52 - quality of that particular ellipse let's
26:55 - see if this shows through versus if I
26:58 - say pixel density one and go back to
27:04 - this let me go backwards again and there
27:10 - we go you can can you see the difference
27:11 - there the sort of a little bit of
27:13 - fuzziness but anyway this is not the
27:15 - primary thing that I'm that I thought I
27:17 - want to talk about I want to just look
27:18 - at the fact that create graphics is a
27:20 - way of creating this off-screen
27:23 - off-screen so there's a lot that you
27:25 - could do with this for example let's
27:28 - just let's say I am not actually going
27:32 - to draw this draw with the mouse so I'm
27:37 - gonna have an variable called X and set
27:41 - that to a variable called X and a
27:44 - variable called Y I'm gonna set those to
27:46 - 50/50 I'm going to make a create
27:49 - graphics that's one hundred by hundred
27:51 - I'm going to have the I'm gonna draw the
27:57 - ellipse there and I'm gonna say X plus
27:59 - equals some random number I'm just going
28:01 - to move I'm gonna move X&Y around
28:04 - randomly and let's make this smaller so
28:09 - let's see what happens here
28:11 - and I'm actually also going to add a
28:15 - background to draw so look so now I have
28:18 - that and let's just see just to see
28:21 - what's going on here let's make the
28:23 - background for the graphics object this
28:25 - so you can see that is now that's an
28:28 - off-screen element that I'm drawing onto
28:31 - the screen so there's no reason why I
28:33 - couldn't do something like oh let me
28:36 - draw twice
28:37 - and now I see the same pattern repeating
28:40 - and maybe what I could actually do is
28:42 - say push and a translate you know 200
28:50 - comma 200 rotate by some angle and draw
28:55 - the image again say pop and I could
28:59 - create an angle variable and now I could
29:04 - say angle plus equals 0.01 whoops
29:09 - angle my iki still does not work and you
29:13 - can see now and let's make that go a
29:15 - little faster and let's say image mode
29:20 - Center and here we go we can see now
29:24 - this that thing that I'm drawing an
29:26 - off-screen canvas is spinning so it's a
29:29 - way of creating there's so many ways we
29:31 - could mix and match these you know I
29:32 - could certainly I could tint it so once
29:35 - it's a separate image there's no reason
29:39 - why I can't manipulate and actually what
29:41 - I'm gonna do in another video which is
29:43 - going to be in a different playlist but
29:45 - I'm gonna look at how I could take a 2d
29:48 - graphics context and make it a texture
29:50 - in a 3d world which will expand on this
29:52 - idea even further so Kelly in the chat
29:56 - is asking is the create graphics context
29:59 - always a rectangle would there be any
30:01 - way to make it polygonal it's not
30:04 - pronounced that word correctly now yes I
30:08 - mean yes and no so by definition an
30:12 - image on the computer is a rectangular
30:16 - grid of pixels there is no other way it
30:19 - can be stored because it is actually
30:21 - just an array of numbers of colors
30:22 - however there's no reason why we
30:25 - couldn't have certain pixels be
30:27 - transparent let me show you what I mean
30:29 - by that what if I actually never okay so
30:33 - first of all let me fix this let me put
30:35 - this somewhere where we can see it that
30:39 - first version of the image let me put it
30:42 - at a 100 comma 100 so we can see this is
30:46 - the sort of plain canvas that I'm
30:48 - drawing on this is the one
30:51 - why not what if I wanted to appear
30:54 - circular well there's no reason why I
30:57 - had to draw that background on it an
30:59 - off-screen canvas will actually begin as
31:02 - fully transparent look what happens now
31:04 - so look at this when it's fully
31:06 - transparent you know it's still
31:09 - rectangular I can't expand off of it
31:12 - but there's I could create the illusion
31:14 - of it being circular so now what I could
31:16 - do is I could have said at the beginning
31:18 - draw an ellipse that's at the middle
31:21 - that has a diameter of 100 and make that
31:25 - ellipse which I gray whoa oops I forgot
31:31 - this is a classic mistake I wanted to
31:33 - make that ellipse gray but I forgot to
31:36 - say graphics dot fill so now it looks
31:40 - like I have this like circular thing and
31:42 - by the way I could there's no reason why
31:46 - I couldn't just move that one around
31:48 - with the mouse so it looks like it's a
31:54 - circular thing you get to behind this
31:56 - one now the thing is it's actually not
31:59 - circular I'm getting lucky but you could
32:00 - see how that thing walked off of that
32:02 - circle so I would probably have to do
32:04 - something one thing I could do there's
32:08 - probably a way that I could I could
32:09 - always keep those edge pixels
32:11 - transparent or I could constrain the
32:13 - motion of that particular lips I mean
32:14 - I'm just like spinning my wheels
32:16 - spinning my gears here just try and
32:18 - random things I'm gonna pause for a
32:21 - second to see if anybody else in the
32:22 - chat has any questions of any features I
32:24 - could add
32:33 - or I'm looking to see if anybody has
32:38 - anything else in the chat they want to
32:40 - mention throw down some clip so Alka
32:44 - mentions that canvas has a clip function
32:47 - so that's something that I would have to
32:48 - implement with htaed of html5 canvas can
32:59 - you use your mouse to draw the same
33:01 - thing twice yeah absolutely
33:04 - so yeah so let's try that so I'm going
33:09 - to mention a couple of these things all
33:12 - right couple notes have come in from the
33:16 - chat that are worth mentioning one is
33:18 - that everything in p5 is wrapping native
33:21 - html5 canvas functionality and there is
33:24 - a clip function that's part of the
33:26 - native html5 canvas so that's something
33:28 - that you could investigate perhaps using
33:30 - as well I haven't looked into that but I
33:32 - will look into that there's all I'm also
33:35 - being told breaking news that I forgot
33:37 - about this that if I wanted to
33:39 - dynamically figure out the scaling the
33:43 - pixel density function I'll show you
33:45 - this if so if I call pixel density with
33:48 - a number this is me specifically setting
33:51 - a pixel density but if I call it without
33:53 - an argument it's actually going to
33:55 - return to me the current pixel density
33:57 - which is one because I said it but if I
34:00 - don't set it and I call it you can see
34:03 - that it's two so this is something that
34:05 - this is something that I could
34:06 - potentially use to this is something
34:10 - that I could potentially use to what am
34:13 - I trying to say
34:18 - this is something I could potentially
34:20 - use to dynamically determine the pixel
34:25 - density and scale the off-screen canvas
34:27 - to read the write the same as the
34:28 - on-screen chemists a ghin that's a
34:30 - little bit of an aside here so let's
34:31 - let's think about this what if I take
34:34 - this one step so it's a bit elastic and
34:36 - could I continue to do the drawing thing
34:37 - so let's actually try to get the drawing
34:39 - thing to work still no I don't want to
34:42 - do that
34:44 - I think this is pretty much all that I
34:49 - want to do here and my live streaming
34:58 - somewhere else no just here I'm trying
35:00 - to think is there anything else I want
35:01 - to add to this hmm I think this is kind
35:07 - of the idea and I think I'll just move
35:10 - to doing the move to doing the hit make
35:21 - like a radar on the green yeah I mean
35:23 - there's so many things I could do I was
35:25 - thinking I could like show I could like
35:27 - stamp it multiple times but I think this
35:29 - is the idea so I'm just gonna I'm going
35:31 - to yes yes yes I won't be FF gaming I I
35:36 - see your comment all right so I'm gonna
35:40 - move on from this example so here's uh
35:43 - here's some exercises for you to try
35:45 - you can if you make of something you can
35:47 - share it in the comments or tweet me at
35:49 - Schiffman but one thing to do could you
35:51 - make a particle system where the
35:53 - elements of the particles the the each
35:55 - particle is actually an off-screen
35:57 - canvas that has some kind of like
35:58 - algorithmic thing happening on it could
36:01 - you create a drawing system where the
36:04 - user gets to draw and then the drawing
36:05 - is shown it tiled in multiple different
36:07 - ways so that I you know what if you used
36:12 - like instead of either just erasing the
36:14 - background or not erasing the background
36:15 - what if you use like an alpha as part of
36:18 - the background so you see these um kind
36:20 - of like fading trails there's a lot of
36:22 - possible things that you could look at
36:25 - it do so I hope you make some more stuff
36:26 - with create graphics in p5 and if you're
36:31 - interested in looking at this same topic
36:33 - but applied in WebGL look for a link in
36:36 - this video's description to that ok
36:37 - thank you goodbye alright
36:41 - deep space void is saying it sort of
36:43 - looks like a random Walker in fact yes
36:46 - this is exactly a random Walker I
36:48 - probably should have mentioned that all
36:51 - right so let's now go towards doing this
36:55 - in WebGL
36:58 - so let me go back to my WebGL example
37:03 - and whoops what do I have here
37:15 - p5 WebGL didn't I make a backup of the
37:18 - WebGL debugging so I guess I let me just
37:22 - start over from scratch here again if
37:26 - anybody has any good ideas for texturing
37:30 - using a well one is hot this is actually
37:32 - the only way at present I think to do
37:34 - text so let's look at that alright so so
37:41 - I'm gonna say p5 G - B graphics texture
37:49 - then I'm going to go there and I'm going
37:54 - to open that up I really got to change
37:58 - my template let's get some let's have
38:05 - the video the tutorial actually start
38:07 - with something already like a spinning
38:13 - cube tonight so and I will say rotate X
38:24 - angle rotate Y angle times 1.3 rotate Z
38:31 - angle times 0.7 this is just totally
38:34 - arbitrary box 100 let's add ambient
38:43 - light directional light let's just add a
38:45 - directional light 255
38:49 - from the top I don't know right or
38:53 - something and that's it let's take a
38:59 - look at this let's run
39:05 - a server and let's see what we've got
39:14 - here whoops directional lights
39:18 - directional light all right that didn't
39:22 - work because it needs to have all three
39:26 - Oh an angle plus equal all right I guess
39:36 - I should so maybe if I add some ambient
39:40 - light that's just like a little bit less
39:43 - bright that's kind of what I was going
39:46 - for and let's actually just have it
39:50 - shine from where where does that's fine
39:53 - and that's Z so let's have it shine from
39:57 - the top so that's actually the bottom
40:02 - all right
40:06 - all right and that's spinning really
40:07 - fast okay
40:12 - so here we are I now have a simple WebGL
40:17 - context let's get rid of the sound
40:19 - library get her this style thing no I
40:22 - refuse to do something sensible like
40:25 - changed my template now before I forget
40:27 - okay so we now have a standard WebGL
40:31 - example and what I'm going to do now
40:35 - have to think about this is I would like
40:38 - to use create graphics as a texture what
40:43 - would be interesting should I just do
40:44 - the random Walker thing again
40:46 - I mean well text is one thing that you
40:51 - have to do this way so I could start
40:52 - with that and then I could maybe even
40:59 - just pull one of my previous examples
41:02 - that's like some kind of algorithmic
41:03 - pattern like a like what the fractal
41:06 - tree or something so maybe I'll grab the
41:09 - fractal tree example and we'll look at
41:11 - that so let me look let me find one of
41:13 - those fractal tree p5.js
41:26 - so basically this example and where is
41:32 - the code for that coding challenge for
41:35 - teen coding challenges number fourteen
41:43 - fractal tree let's get about yes
41:46 - okay great so this is what I'm going to
41:48 - attempt to do alright I think we're good
41:54 - yes
41:58 - any last suggestions all right
42:06 - hello welcome to another fire hold on
42:17 - hello welcome to another WebGL p5.js
42:21 - tutorial in this one I am going to
42:23 - actually don't even have this on my list
42:25 - of stuff but I'm gonna look again at the
42:27 - texture function and previously I looked
42:29 - at how to use an image or a video as a
42:32 - texture in this video I want to look at
42:35 - how to make an off-screen graphics
42:37 - buffer essentially like a 2d canvas that
42:40 - I'm drawing somewhere else how to make
42:42 - that a texture in the 3d world and the
42:44 - way to do that is where the function
42:45 - called create graphics now I should
42:46 - mention I have an another video entirely
42:48 - just about create graphics that'll be
42:50 - linked to in this video's description if
42:51 - you want to go look at that but I'll
42:52 - also explain it in this video so you can
42:54 - just keep watching ok so I'm starting
42:56 - with a very simple WebGL example the
42:58 - only thing for this example is a sort of
43:00 - empty space with a spinning cube and the
43:04 - cube at whoops the code is here there is
43:06 - a single directional light there's an
43:09 - ambient light and I'm kind of rotating
43:10 - this box using the Box function to make
43:12 - this cube so we know that the texture
43:15 - function works and I could timeout for a
43:21 - second let me get the kittens
43:34 - and so let me just add a kitten really
43:43 - quick
44:08 - now we know that the texture function
44:13 - works in a previous video I hope so I
44:15 - also have here unloading like an image
44:18 - of a kitten so just to see that texture
44:20 - works let's add texture and then that
44:23 - kitten is that what I called it
44:24 - kitten yes so if I add that we now see
44:27 - the kitten on the side that same kitten
44:31 - on the side of every of each side of the
44:32 - box now one thing will be an interesting
44:33 - exercise is how would you make a
44:35 - different image on each side you're
44:37 - gonna have to make this a custom shape
44:39 - maybe you make it a bunch of planes
44:40 - maybe use begin shape and shape I'll
44:42 - come back to that another video but
44:44 - right now and we should make the light
44:45 - come from the front actually so I'm
44:47 - gonna have the light come from the front
44:49 - just directly from the front this
44:52 - directional light because I want to be
44:53 - able to see the beautiful bright kittens
44:55 - as they face forward okay so but what I
44:59 - want to do is not have it be an image so
45:01 - a way that I can create create canvas is
45:05 - a function that makes a canvas and I've
45:06 - made a canvas a WebGL 3d rendering
45:09 - canvas but I can also use another
45:11 - function and I'm gonna call it I'm gonna
45:16 - create a very ball I'm just gonna call
45:17 - it graphics and I'm gonna say graphics
45:20 - equals create graphics and now I'm gonna
45:24 - make a square image 200 200
45:28 - so I'm now making a graphics object
45:30 - that's 200 by 200 and this is something
45:34 - that can be textured to the box so this
45:37 - graphics object it's like a canvas I can
45:39 - texture to the box so let's look now
45:41 - let's refresh now I don't see anything
45:43 - why do I not see anything because when I
45:46 - make a graphics context the first thing
45:50 - it is is just transparent pixels but I
45:52 - can call any of p5 2d drawing functions
45:56 - on that graphics object so I could say
45:58 - graphics dot background and say
46:01 - background 255 and now we see that is
46:06 - there and you know what I could do I
46:08 - could even say graphics dot background
46:13 - and now this is going to flicker so a
46:16 - little flickering warning here and
46:17 - random color you can see this is now
46:20 - just giving it a random background every
46:22 - frame so whatever I would draw on it so
46:25 - for example I could also do something
46:26 - like graphics the ellipse Mouse X Mouse
46:31 - Y Mouse Y 20 and I could say fill oh no
46:38 - graphics dot fill 255 0 255 now watch
46:43 - what this will do look as I move the
46:46 - mouse around I'm kind of drawing on that
46:48 - graphics object and it's still texture
46:51 - to the each side of the cube now what
46:53 - when would you want to do this number
46:55 - one is just what do you want to do
46:56 - something kind of goofy or interesting
46:57 - uh yeah I'm sure you can think of
46:59 - creative uses of this more than I can
47:01 - but here's a reason why you might
47:03 - actually have to use it at present I I
47:06 - don't know that this will always be true
47:07 - but at present the only way to render
47:09 - text in 3d is to actually use that with
47:13 - the text function is to take that place
47:16 - the text on a 2d 2d graphics context and
47:20 - then make that a texture so for example
47:22 - if I wanted to have a message like let
47:28 - love equal I'm gonna make another
47:32 - graphics context graphics equals create
47:37 - I don't love equals create graphics
47:46 - graphics so my kids used to say instead
47:51 - of breakfast breakfast or breakfast and
47:55 - I feel like every time to say graphics
47:56 - I'm saying it wrong let your bleed
47:57 - graphic anyway create graphics no no no
48:02 - I've lost my train of thought
48:03 - haha 300 comma 100 and then I'm going to
48:06 - say love dot fill 255 and I'm going to
48:16 - say love dot text-align:center and then
48:22 - I'm gonna say love dot text 100 the word
48:25 - love 150 comma
48:28 - 50 so this now should be an a
48:32 - two-dimensional graphics context that's
48:35 - 300 by 100 that has the word love in it
48:38 - so first just to like see that this is
48:42 - working let me texture it whoops all
48:45 - right what happened what did I do wrong
48:46 - here create oh you know what hold on a
48:50 - sec interesting whoa okay
48:55 - so one thing that just happened there
48:56 - which I wasn't aware of would happen and
48:59 - let's say love dot text size 64 to make
49:06 - it bigger
49:07 - is that so here we go now one thing
49:12 - you'll notice is again the image a
49:16 - texture a graphics thing is transparent
49:18 - by default so I'm actually just seeing
49:20 - those letters on the side but the rest
49:22 - of that cube is transparent if I had
49:25 - said loved background and I said zero
49:29 - for example this now I don't see that
49:33 - cube is transparent anymore so that's an
49:36 - important thing to notice and I could
49:38 - make it semi-transparent like I could
49:40 - say 255 255 255 comma 100 so now it's
49:45 - like semi-transparent so there's a lot
49:48 - of possible things I can do here okay
49:49 - but there was an important thing I
49:51 - wanted to mention which is that when I
49:53 - made when I made and I wanted this to be
49:59 - more in the center there we go that's
50:03 - more in the center when I made the
50:05 - graphics context not a square like 300
50:09 - comma 200 it broke so I'm not sure
50:13 - whether this is a bug in the p5 WebGL at
50:16 - present or whether this is just
50:17 - something that you actually really have
50:19 - to be conscientious of but because what
50:22 - I would have expected it to do was take
50:23 - that image and kind of like squish it
50:26 - onto the onto the side of the cube but
50:29 - it's not doing that at present so
50:30 - something I might have to investigate in
50:31 - the future but what I wanted just like
50:35 - what I was actually thinking is what if
50:37 - I let's just take this out for a second
50:39 - what if I just wanted the tech
50:41 - to appear and almost look flat the way
50:43 - that I would probably do that would be
50:45 - to say texture love plane 300 comma 200
50:51 - so a plane is a flat surface with a
50:54 - given width and a height so if the text
50:57 - itself is exactly if the if the
51:02 - off-screen canvas is exactly 300 by 200
51:05 - if I make the plane 300 I 200 it should
51:07 - map directly so let's take a look at
51:08 - that and that also did not work so
51:12 - what's the issue look at this so it
51:18 - looks like the issue is at present p5
51:22 - WebGL can only take square textures this
51:27 - is a bit of a problem so this to me
51:30 - seems like a bug let's just let's just
51:34 - change this by one pixel
51:36 - yeah broke so that's got to be it now it
51:39 - sort of makes sense but if I used an
51:41 - image that's not a square let's let's
51:43 - I'm kind of off outside of this video
51:46 - now these are is this a square no these
51:49 - aren't perfect squares that's definitely
51:51 - not a square it is 100 by 90 well hold
51:58 - on that's not the one that I was
51:59 - actually using 100 by 98 yes so that's
52:05 - got to be a bug hmm oh we found a bug
52:16 - I'm looking at the chat make it 500 by
52:19 - 500 to test the resize this is a good
52:21 - quick good thing yeah so that was fine
52:28 - all right hold on
52:34 - so to me I feel like this is a bug
52:36 - because I know for a fact that this
52:37 - kitten image was not a perfect square
52:40 - image so there's no reason why p5 can't
52:42 - figure out how to take a non square
52:44 - image and kind of squish it or stretch
52:47 - it onto a non square or a square piece
52:53 - of geometry so but I'm gonna leave that
52:54 - aside maybe sometime by the time you're
52:56 - watching this will be some information
52:57 - in the comments or the video's
52:58 - description about how that's fixed but
53:00 - no matter if all I wanted to do was
53:02 - display text there's no reason why I
53:05 - couldn't just make you know I can for
53:10 - now what I can do is I can make my
53:12 - graphics object and plane and plane
53:16 - object match size I can position the
53:19 - this in the center the way that I want
53:22 - to I can make it have a transparent
53:24 - background and I can say use that as a
53:27 - plane and here we go so whoops what have
53:30 - I done so I need to say text align whoa
53:34 - okay hold on I'm missing a couple things
53:36 - text-align:center the Creek graphics I
53:39 - wanted it to be 300 by 300 I messed up
53:42 - some stuff oh whoa cuz I changed that
53:44 - this was something I was using
53:45 - previously sorry everybody and now there
53:49 - we go so and by the way if I take this
53:52 - out now I have just text in 3d that
53:57 - appears 2d the reason why I'm showing
53:59 - this to you is because now if I put the
54:01 - rotation back in if I put the lighting
54:05 - back in we can see this is now just
54:09 - appearing like text in 3d which is what
54:12 - I wanted to show you in the first place
54:14 - so this is how you do text in 3d but
54:17 - this could be anything so for example
54:20 - what if I've drawn I'm not sure if I
54:25 - wanted to keep going with this yes three
54:30 - J s is awesome people in the chat are
54:31 - talking about it you should use three J
54:33 - s you should learn it you should use it
54:34 - it's wonderful
54:35 - I just am using this because it's a
54:37 - project I'm working on and it's the
54:39 - thing that I know and I love but yeah if
54:42 - you really want to do robust fully
54:44 - featured 3d
54:45 - that's like high performance at present
54:48 - 3GS is going to be a a better library I
54:51 - mean there's different metrics it might
54:52 - not be a simple of a library it might
54:54 - not have other aspects beyond just 3d
54:56 - but for just pure 3d alright do I want
55:01 - to go on and add the fractal tree thing
55:04 - I'll just make that an exercise right
55:07 - I'll make that an exercise so here's an
55:12 - exercise for you find some interesting
55:15 - 2d animation generative designs for
55:19 - example you could take this fractal tree
55:22 - design that I do a video about where to
55:23 - witch cook the code is over here I'll
55:25 - link to both of these in the video's
55:27 - description can you make this tree a
55:31 - texture in on a 3d piece of 3d geometry
55:34 - what happens if you texture to a sphere
55:36 - a torus a cube that's a good thing so
55:38 - give that a try and see how that goes
55:40 - thanks for watching
55:46 - all right mend your sponge would be cool
55:49 - right oh the mentor sponge in p5.js
55:51 - would be a cool idea okay so I think
55:56 - this is good where are we now 11:45 I've
56:00 - got about an hour what else can I do
56:03 - what else can I do today so here's the
56:18 - thing did is there a Shrike try loading
56:21 - and an obj file
56:23 - does anybody have one for me I would
56:29 - love to try this why not right I would I
56:33 - guess I could do both of these but I
56:34 - keep going and just be done with the
56:35 - WebGL stuff
56:37 - let's try loading an obj file train file
56:46 - okay so here's my problem
56:49 - alpha thank you very much oh I'm in the
56:52 - wrong camera thank you very much for
56:54 - that obj file I have to get it onto this
56:56 - computer so is there a
57:00 - from Bram so I need a like just to like
57:06 - a bitly link or something like that that
57:09 - I can download it here real quick art 3d
57:13 - fractal all I should totally do like a
57:15 - 3d tree right alright so if anybody
57:25 - could give me a link to download it
57:27 - yeah I'm sure there's some kind of fancy
57:30 - software I could use to move things from
57:32 - computer to computer actually I have
57:34 - that set up right here because I have
57:35 - this like Dropbox folder for some kind
57:38 - of like I don't know what what account
57:42 - this is logged into hold on buffering
57:54 - coding train live at gmail.com and what
57:58 - am i logged into here alright I'm
58:06 - getting the link oh wait wait wait
58:07 - Ram get got got a link okay great so
58:10 - alright I'm back alright so let me type
58:15 - that in
58:18 - g-gee o o GL capital P hi this is better
58:25 - Alka
58:26 - thank you Alka TV slash static slash
58:31 - trained obj okay there we go alright
58:35 - I've got this obj file look at that
58:45 - alright we are going to try this this is
58:48 - very exciting
58:49 - oh I'm so excited alright so I'm gonna
58:54 - I'm gonna be a little smarter about this
58:56 - today and not create as much work for
58:59 - merging and I'm going to just copy this
59:05 - folder call this load model and we'll
59:11 - keep the kittens in there
59:13 - I'm going to go back and go into load
59:21 - model and run the server and open it in
59:26 - Adam and let's get rid of all this stuff
59:36 - let's keep the kitten in there just in
59:39 - case let's keep the angle in there let's
59:43 - keep the lights in there and the box and
59:53 - do I now have a simple example here we
59:59 - go how come it's not oh I forgot angle
60:02 - plus equals zero point 300 three all
60:07 - right okay so here we go I am now going
60:14 - to attempt to replace this with a model
60:18 - of a train so hold on whoops no come on
60:30 - don't
60:31 - aah no no no no no I don't want to copy
60:37 - the name of the file I want to copy the
60:39 - file and I don't actually need the
60:40 - copied file I'll just move it all right
60:44 - okay here we go everybody
60:52 - all right
60:56 - everybody always asks me this so I do
61:02 - this a lot and I'm using command slash
61:05 - to do that I also use this a lot command
61:09 - square bracket to indent or not indent a
61:13 - selection a little tip it for you for
61:15 - everybody and get asked that a lot
61:16 - by the way I'm terrible with this stuff
61:19 - so everybody else has much better ways
61:20 - of doing this stuff okay hello I'm back
61:34 - this oh sorry
61:39 - hello I am back here and again this is
61:42 - never ending but there's so much more to
61:45 - do with WebGL mp5 this video I'm gonna
61:47 - look at this load model and an obj file
61:50 - this is a toy train it is a
61:53 - three-dimensional physical actual toy
61:56 - train in what I have already on the
61:58 - computer here is a file that is in the
62:04 - format obj so there are a lot of
62:05 - different file formats for 3d models a
62:08 - 3d model file is a file that has inside
62:11 - of itself all of the geometry all all
62:15 - the vertices all that all the
62:16 - specifications for a three-dimensional
62:18 - geometry I thing that's gonna be big
62:20 - system 3 I am totally fired from the
62:31 - coding tree let me just start over again
62:34 - give me give me one ball again for today
62:36 - I think the issue is that I have the
62:42 - sniffles
62:50 - that's not don't litter folks alright
63:00 - hello here we are in this video I'm
63:04 - going to attempt to take this
63:05 - 3-dimensional toy train and put it into
63:09 - my computer somehow not really and and
63:12 - the topic here is that I want to this is
63:14 - in my WebGL 3d p5.js serious I want to
63:17 - look at load model so what if I had a
63:19 - file on my computer that had all the
63:21 - geometry for a train in it or anything
63:24 - else so you might know about 3d modeling
63:26 - maybe you use some type of 3d authoring
63:28 - environment to create your own 3d miles
63:31 - models this little piece just fell off
63:33 - um maybe you you go to a website and you
63:36 - found somebody else's 3d model to
63:38 - download but what there are lots of
63:41 - different file formats so that's sort of
63:42 - the question but the file format that
63:45 - you want to look for to import a 3d
63:47 - model into p5 is obj the death blow
63:55 - everybody's years they're really all of
63:58 - a sudden I hope I'm not getting another
63:59 - cold mean it's just an allergy allergy
64:01 - oh I definitely have an allergy to three
64:04 - the third dimension I'm actually this is
64:06 - a very strange thing but I am allergic
64:08 - to the z-axis it's very weird
64:10 - if you don't this about me okay let's go
64:17 - over the computer and see what happens
64:19 - alright so on this computer I already
64:22 - have a file called Train obj thank you -
64:25 - Bram for helping me find this file Bram
64:29 - in the patron group I'm gonna I'm
64:32 - actually just look at this file look at
64:33 - this so this was originally made in
64:35 - Rhino that's like a comment and look at
64:37 - all this stuff that's actually what's in
64:38 - a 3d model
64:40 - it's just V all of these vertices these
64:42 - are all the XYZ coordinates so you can
64:44 - make your own geometry algorithmically
64:46 - with primitive 3d shapes or begin shape
64:48 - vertex and shape but here's a file
64:51 - format that has a lot of vertices in and
64:52 - already that's I love looking at that so
64:54 - how do I get that into p5 well I still
64:57 - have a kitten in this let's leave the
64:59 - kitten here just maybe we'll see what
65:00 - happens with that I'm going to make a
65:02 - variable called train and in
65:04 - reload I'm going to say train equals
65:06 - load model so the load model function is
65:09 - just like load image loads image data
65:11 - load JSON loads JSON data load mile
65:14 - model loads a three-dimensional model
65:18 - and there's no reason why I couldn't
65:20 - replace now box with drawing that model
65:24 - which is with the function model train
65:28 - oh shoot
65:35 - all right I failed here what went wrong
65:41 - uncaught maximum cost I render GL
65:44 - flatten mm-hmm okay so what happened
65:48 - here I'm looking at wonder if the obj
66:01 - file okay I think we might have found a
66:06 - bug in p5 which is that it's possible
66:09 - I'm not so sure yet but it's possible
66:11 - that load model doesn't actually work in
66:15 - in preload let's put this here hold on
66:25 - hold on let me fix this and then go back
66:28 - into the video the it is there
66:40 - I have to go back to an old version this
66:46 - also broke shoot where was my CDN why is
66:54 - this open I mean one of these yeah let's
67:04 - grab this let me get the CDN link to see
67:11 - and let's go check that so I'm just
67:18 - trying now an older we're gonna p5 let's
67:20 - try point 1 4 hmm well oh I'm in their
67:32 - own sketch here oh I did the wrong yeah
67:35 - I did the wrong changed it in the wrong
67:40 - sketch sorry let's try 0.14 there we go
67:50 - oh ok ok so this is working problem
67:54 - importing model ah so there's already a
67:56 - tissue okay great so so that's good but
68:07 - that's the problem let me go back to let
68:13 - me just put it in preload again that's
68:15 - the easiest place to do it
68:17 - yeah ok and so interestingly enough this
68:24 - model is not like the centered around so
68:29 - ok let me just break it real quick
68:40 - so that it's broken
68:52 - okay okay so I've determined what the
69:01 - error was unfortunately at the time of
69:04 - this recording there is an issue let me
69:08 - try and go back
69:14 - okay so I've determined what that error
69:16 - let me get let me open up the github
69:18 - issue github issue processing p5.js what
69:23 - is yeah the model is not centered around
69:28 - zero if you can fix that up and I'll
69:30 - redownload it I'll make that part of the
69:31 - video because that's something that's
69:34 - going to happen to people issue two to
69:36 - six three issues two to six three let's
69:42 - bring this up
69:52 - oh is it is it actually only with large
69:55 - models so would this have worked fine
69:58 - without a with a smaller model okay so
70:07 - they'll mention that all right
70:19 - okay so I have figured out why this
70:22 - broke and unfortunately it broke because
70:24 - that model that I'm loading the train
70:25 - model is actually quite a complex one
70:27 - there's no reason why it can't work and
70:29 - it could it should at some point work
70:31 - there's actually at the time of this
70:33 - recording there is a github issue on the
70:34 - p5.js repo so if you're watching this in
70:37 - the future
70:37 - go and check this maybe it's been
70:39 - resolved but the way that I fixed it
70:40 - right now is I just reverted to an
70:42 - earlier version of p5 the version that
70:44 - I'm now running is 0.5 point one four
70:47 - so let's now have this ready and I'm
70:51 - going to hit refresh there's the Train
70:56 - spinning there's my 3d miles right now
70:58 - interesting enough why is it spinning
71:00 - like a crazy thing let's go and put the
71:03 - box back in let's add the box as well
71:08 - now you can sort of see what's going on
71:10 - the so one thing that's important when
71:13 - you're importing a model is well what is
71:16 - it the models own internal coordinate
71:18 - system and in this case this model that
71:21 - I happen to import it is not centered
71:23 - itself around zero zero and this is
71:25 - going to make it much harder for me to
71:26 - use I could do like some kind of offset
71:29 - I'm like manually like maybe I could
71:30 - figure it out I could say something like
71:32 - right before I draw the model let me
71:35 - translate like maybe negative 200 or
71:38 - like 100 along the x-axis that went
71:42 - that's closer
71:44 - let me try like negative 200 so that got
71:49 - that got further away so maybe it's not
71:51 - that so I could start I could try to
71:52 - debug and figure this out but what
71:54 - instead what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
71:56 - revise or perhaps Alka Alka has already
72:01 - done this for me Alka in the chat has
72:03 - revised the model to sent around 0 so
72:05 - hold on for a second I'll be right back
72:07 - with a magical new model ok so thank you
72:12 - Alka Alka TV why is it not coming up
72:20 - from your a static train corrected dot
72:24 - obj
72:28 - so I'm gonna grab that train corrected
72:31 - and I'm gonna go to desktop load model
72:38 - I'm gonna put that in there train
72:40 - corrected okay I'm back
72:50 - and I'm going to change I now have a new
72:52 - obj file train corrected we can look at
72:55 - it actually it might be worth just
72:56 - taking a peek at it because we can see
72:58 - look at these numbers now they look more
73:00 - like they're smaller and there's some
73:02 - negative ones so maybe is actually
73:03 - centered around zero zero so let's try
73:06 - this model let's go back and load it we
73:10 - can say okay well that box is still
73:12 - there so the train is now stuck inside
73:14 - the box let's actually let's get rid of
73:21 - the box and let's there we go so there's
73:25 - the train so what should I do now
73:28 - hopefully this is like an open source
73:30 - model often like the source but I'm
73:32 - gonna post this code hopefully now
73:34 - everyone watching can make some goofy
73:35 - like 3d animations with smoke coming out
73:37 - of the train or that sort of thing but
73:39 - let's let's try to just experiment with
73:41 - this a little more so for example what
73:44 - if I just have the ambient light have
73:48 - some color so you can see that this
73:53 - model is going to respond to the light
73:56 - what if I were to give it different
73:59 - material like what if I try specular
74:02 - material that's white right can you see
74:09 - does that look different I can't really
74:12 - tell so did that material apply I don't
74:15 - know let's see normal material
74:18 - let's give it a normal material which is
74:20 - that debug rainbow color yeah so the
74:24 - material normal material is certainly
74:26 - applying it's unclear to me whether the
74:28 - specular one did or it's just hard to
74:29 - see so you can see that that's working
74:31 - and I don't see any reason why I
74:34 - couldn't texture the terrain
74:39 - let's try that oh my goodness it's the
74:44 - kitty cat train all aboard the kitty cat
74:49 - train sorry you know I have to try it
74:56 - some attempt to make these videos more
74:58 - interesting it's mostly failed attempts
75:00 - but so you can see this actually like
75:02 - the p5 somehow decided it would texture
75:05 - this in some arbitrary way so wonderful
75:09 - so I I could do more with this I would
75:12 - love to you know figure out how to make
75:14 - the train move and then have some smoke
75:16 - come out of it maybe the smoke could be
75:17 - spears with cloudy textures or something
75:19 - like that but I'm gonna leave that to
75:21 - you as an exercise now you can see that
75:23 - in addition to making geometry with your
75:26 - Oh making geometry with your own
75:37 - primitive shapes you can also load a
75:41 - model from an obj file and something I
75:43 - still haven't shown you which I do
75:45 - intend to do is how to make a custom
75:48 - piece of geometry using big in shape and
75:50 - n shape thanks very much all right there
75:59 - we go all aboard the pink it kind of
76:05 - looks like kind of looks like rosy baby
76:11 - no all right how are we doing 1205 what
76:18 - could I possibly do
76:26 - all right just to mention I noticing
76:29 - that I'm getting some dm's in the patron
76:33 - slack Channel so that's a fully correct
76:38 - about that's fine I'll add that in hi
76:41 - term I don't I don't look at those it's
76:44 - too much from but so if there's
76:45 - something really important just post it
76:47 - in the live channel okay
76:49 - can you rotate the camera with the mouse
76:52 - absolutely but that might require me to
76:54 - use quarter notes all right so now the
77:07 - question is do I dare attempt to do the
77:13 - custom shape and then I can really feel
77:16 - done with 3d except for shade right also
77:19 - should possibly consider redoing the
77:22 - camera and perspective video but I guess
77:25 - I'll hold off on that I haven't heard
77:27 - from magical editor not you just yet all
77:35 - right so let's take a look let me maybe
77:39 - mm I have about 40 minutes
77:41 - should we try something let's try a
77:45 - little straw poll just see what happens
77:47 - so last thing so I could do custom shape
77:53 - in 3d and then let me go to this is very
78:01 - very dangerous that I'm doing this but I
78:06 - really should just save these for
78:08 - Thursday but curious to see sure your
78:11 - opinion issues assigned assigned to
78:21 - shift man so this is kind of a list of
78:23 - stuff I could do right now we're - vac
78:26 - oh maybe I should oh I mean the wrong
78:29 - camera
78:30 - sorry sorry everybody sorry everybody
78:33 - I'm really getting bad at this I used to
78:35 - be just so good at it and
78:37 - I forget all the time do I dare do this
78:45 - alright so here's some things word Tyvek
78:50 - image stippling so if you don't know
78:53 - what image stippling is let's look at
79:00 - it's kind of like doing a pattern of
79:03 - dots to create an image like this I
79:06 - really want to do this at some point I
79:08 - probably should research this before I
79:09 - do it not oh this is a cool suggestion
79:18 - from ruby with you can see these like
79:24 - crazy oh this is 3d huh this would make
79:28 - sense to try to do actually how would I
79:30 - do this in P 5 would it really work I
79:33 - would probably want to do this in
79:34 - processing to make these like crazy nots
79:36 - okay so that's one thing
79:41 - 3d not that would kind of make sense to
79:44 - do since the theme has been WebGL what
79:49 - was the other what else was there
79:51 - electron app oh boy Electra hunap basics
79:55 - and ASCII art generator why did I get
80:00 - hub work I'm not gonna do that more git
80:02 - and github and ASCII art generator I
80:05 - have no idea what I would do to do that
80:07 - let's just see let's see what people are
80:09 - interested in right now here's your
80:11 - straw poll everybody yeah that's one
80:20 - reason why to that I kind of feel like
80:22 - maybe I should save work to back for
80:24 - January cuz its Lee it goes with the
80:26 - machine learning stuff
80:28 - I sort of feel like I should continue
80:34 - with the WebGL 3v autonomous agents boys
80:40 - I didn't like your boys in there use
80:44 - shaders to do all this stuff that's good
80:46 - idea I don't have a lot of time most of
80:53 - these things are gonna take me more than
80:54 - 30 minutes to do I probably shouldn't I
80:56 - don't I think I should do it Sami people
81:04 - are watching right now I should just do
81:10 - the begin shape in yes someday I'll
81:14 - do shaders you want to learn shaders and
81:18 - pull it I mentioned this yesterday look
81:20 - of shaders up it's double crochet
81:31 - yeah so this is a wonderful wonderful
81:35 - step-by-step guide and tutorial with
81:37 - interactive examples my Patricio
81:40 - Gonzales VEVO and Jen lo highly
81:43 - recommend highly recommend this is way
81:47 - better than anything I could ever do
81:51 - that's been a minute and a half get your
81:54 - votes in now just realize that it's
82:00 - quite unlikely I'm actually gonna listen
82:02 - to what you say Oh Oh No
82:05 - did you guys hear that that was the fire
82:06 - alarm but it it went on and then went
82:08 - off immediate like really quickly but
82:11 - there could be no but it wouldn't go on
82:14 - again all right let's see
82:28 - interested whoa really close here this
82:32 - is just this is too close we need a
82:34 - runoff image stippling electron app 3d
82:39 - not I mean I kind of think I kind of
82:44 - think that the electron app I don't know
82:47 - I mean it's not really makes sense to do
82:49 - right now the image stippling I feel
82:53 - like I want to save for next Thursday
82:55 - because that's gonna be that's gonna be
82:57 - awesome
82:58 - but it's kind of like off what we're
83:01 - doing today although it'd be cool to
83:02 - make that image stippling like a texture
83:04 - I feel like I should try the 3d not the
83:08 - question is how would I possibly do that
83:13 - cuz that's actually kind of an easy I
83:16 - think that's probably a pretty easy
83:17 - challenge to do the issue is like well
83:20 - is there any way to render that because
83:22 - you really need like tubes in 3d and I
83:25 - know I'm pretty sure in processing
83:32 - refresh okay fine
83:36 - electron tap wow you guys are really
83:37 - interested in the electron app stuff
83:39 - that is something on my list do before
83:41 - the end of the year that's kind of
83:44 - interesting custom Taurus right I mean
83:50 - yes there's no reason why I can't do my
83:54 - own tube algorithm but that's the whole
83:57 - project unto itself in processing I'm
83:59 - pretty sure you can connect vertices and
84:03 - it will kind of make like a 3d line
84:06 - which is essentially like a tube before
84:08 - you and I don't adjust spinner I don't
84:13 - think so okay so why don't we just do it
84:16 - in processing and I'll come back let's
84:18 - do the not why not where's my laugh
84:23 - track I don't have a laugh track come on
84:26 - I've got to have a laugh track I have an
84:30 - applause track I have a tick-tock
84:35 - I don't have a laugh truck for my why
84:39 - not joke alright what about some random
84:47 - numbers alright it's been a while I mean
84:51 - one reason for me to save than all this
84:53 - for Thursday's I want to do a whole set
84:55 - of coding challenges and I want them to
84:57 - be in both processing in p5 so maybe I
85:00 - should just maybe I should just finish
85:05 - nobody wants me oh no custom shape in 3d
85:08 - that got some votes maybe I should just
85:11 - finish the 3d tutorials and this is
85:16 - really helpful for me to see that I
85:17 - could do these all next week how
85:26 - disappointed are you all gonna be yeah
85:30 - by the way first of all I did not see I
85:35 - did not wake up this morning to hundreds
85:38 - and hundreds and thousands of
85:40 - notifications with neutrality means with
85:45 - me and my loving animation I mean
85:48 - ridiculous and uh I did all sorts of
85:52 - ridiculous stuff yesterday go back and
85:53 - look alright
85:54 - it's okay maybe maybe it's just not
85:56 - meant to be I was not meant to be a meme
85:59 - custom shape alright alright 3d knots in
86:04 - the lead alright alright I'm gonna I'm
86:11 - gonna do a run off wasting so much time
86:14 - just thinking about this I can't decide
86:19 - what do I do
86:21 - let's just do a quick run off 3d 3d not
86:29 - in processing finish WebGL in p5 GS
86:34 - tutorials which really means custom
86:38 - shades alright everybody here you go
86:48 - please vote for the custom shapes I will
86:51 - do whatever it turns out to be please
86:53 - vote for the Gustav James I would have
86:55 - vote for the custom shapes it actually
86:59 - shows me the results oh I'm the only
87:01 - person who's voted that's weird
87:03 - Oh cuz you guys are behind me in time
87:06 - okay
87:07 - whoops can I please see the arrow
87:15 - bookmark I don't know what that is what
87:17 - is the arrow bookmark Oh arrow what is
87:21 - that I have no idea
87:22 - oh it's like an image I don't know a guy
87:24 - it's in there by accident it's funny I'm
87:28 - going to delete that go back to whoops
87:32 - uh-oh
87:33 - I lost my straw poll here it is all
87:37 - right
87:39 - and now on today's behind door number
87:46 - one is the 3d not in processing which
87:49 - will undoubtedly fail because that's
87:51 - gonna be really complicated behind door
87:53 - number two oh oh oh oh you should do you
87:56 - should pick door number two it's a
87:57 - really exciting tutorial about defusing
88:00 - back in shape and in shape in p5 yes all
88:07 - right I am going to count down ten nine
88:13 - eight seven six five four three two one
88:38 - okay the people have spoken the internet
88:41 - has spoken I must obey the Internet did
88:46 - sad thing is I now have to erase this so
88:51 - oops you didn't even see I didn't even
88:54 - this doesn't work the way that I wanted
88:56 - to I have to erase this because there's
88:58 - there's no doubt that I'm going to have
89:00 - to write do a diagram I don't have time
89:04 - to do this three me not thing this is
89:06 - insane
89:07 - alright so here's the thing everyone
89:09 - should just be prepared for me to run
89:10 - out of time and have not finished this
89:12 - coding challenge and it's possible that
89:15 - if that happens I'll come back later
89:17 - this afternoon but I really do have to
89:19 - finish you know I kind of might have to
89:23 - like five of one I have a thing I want
89:24 - so like I could go a little bit past
89:27 - 12:45 it does bring me great happiness
89:32 - and joy to use processing this is very
89:41 - similar to the Lorenz attractor that I
89:48 - made okay
89:52 - all right here we go everybody
89:55 - so not
90:04 - okay good news
90:08 - Ruby already made this in processing wow
90:14 - look at these so cool now I kind of want
90:20 - to look at the code but I'm not going to
90:25 - so oh you know what's so exciting about
90:28 - this I get to open up processing now I'm
90:31 - pretty sure I don't have lips I'm pretty
90:33 - sure I don't have the most recent
90:38 - version of processing so let's just go
90:40 - and download that
90:41 - oh no it's from September I must let's
90:45 - let's see is that really true
90:50 - Simon Says this is the first time I'm
90:53 - using processing since I broke my elbow
90:55 - interesting three point three point six
91:00 - which version did I just download three
91:03 - point okay so I already have the most
91:04 - recent version great so I can clone oh I
91:07 - don't want to close the web browser but
91:09 - I can close terminal and I can close
91:14 - atom and I can get rid of this and I can
91:22 - open up processing like this oh this is
91:24 - so exciting oh I need something like I'm
91:29 - in love music
91:41 - the way I'd hoped alright so let's add
91:45 - some stuff here just to get started
91:49 - let's say knots
91:55 - I barely remember how to do anything in
92:04 - Java
92:20 - okay here we go everybody
92:40 - hello and welcome no good
92:49 - hello I have a very exciting coding
92:51 - challenge for you today I'm going to
92:53 - attempt to make some 3d not now these
92:55 - are 3d knots made in processing by Ruby
92:59 - Ruby who submitted issue number 72 the
93:02 - rainbow topics repository this is
93:05 - related to super shapes or maybe not
93:06 - related but the idea came from after
93:09 - super shapes
93:10 - knots would be a great follow-up so
93:11 - there's this Wikipedia link and as I
93:13 - often do there is the paul bork website
93:17 - which has tons of mathematical formulas
93:19 - for geometry and i guess i thought back
93:23 - in 2016 i might like to tackle it and i
93:26 - took so long that ruby in fact tackled
93:28 - it herself and you can see these
93:31 - wonderful you can take a look at this
93:34 - github Repub now i haven't actually
93:35 - looked at the code here whatever i
93:39 - affirmed i'm not looked at the code here
93:41 - and but i'm going to certainly look at
93:44 - the paul bork website and i pretty sure
93:46 - that this is going to end up being very
93:48 - similar to another coding challenge
93:50 - where I did the Lorenz attractor so
93:52 - let's take a look so let's see if we can
93:55 - find the simplest way to do this not one
93:58 - not two not three not four but yes five
94:02 - no ha where's my lap drag okay why not
94:05 - do the knots oh this is just this is
94:08 - just getting better with every minute
94:09 - alright so let's look at what let's I
94:16 - want to find the first instance of a
94:17 - formula okay here we go there are a
94:19 - whole family of curves including knots I
94:22 - don't know how well you can read this
94:23 - let's make this a little bigger there
94:25 - are a whole family of curves including
94:26 - knots which are formed by the equations
94:28 - x equals R times cosine of V times
94:34 - cosine of theta y equals R times cosine
94:36 - of feet times sine of theta Z equals R
94:40 - times the sine of feet now I've done
94:42 - this before right didn't I have a video
94:44 - about spherical geometry where this was
94:47 - really really really really similar hmm
94:50 - so
94:52 - this is you I would I would just go back
94:53 - and review that right we can find the
94:55 - points along a 3d sphere by having two
94:59 - different angles and this idea of
95:01 - spherical coordinates and you using
95:04 - spherical coordinates so what this is is
95:06 - probably weaving a path around that
95:09 - sphere is going to end up with some
95:10 - interesting knock patterns so for
95:12 - example we could do it this way whoa so
95:17 - which are the equation sprite for
95:19 - converting from polar to Cartesian
95:20 - purple coordinates that we make them our
95:22 - theta fee a function of the parameter
95:24 - beta which ranges from 0 to PI ah look
95:28 - at this oh I love this okay okay so so
95:31 - first we just let's get these formulas
95:33 - let's grab this formula and let's put
95:36 - this in our coach so I have a blank
95:38 - sketch here I'm doing this in processing
95:40 - which has a robust 3d rendering
95:42 - environment P 3d I've been doing
95:44 - recently a lot of video tutorials about
95:46 - WebGL in P 5gs so maybe I'll try to redo
95:48 - this one so let's put these formulas in
95:51 - here and put them up here in just in the
95:54 - comments now let's get these formulas
96:00 - and put them here as well so this is
96:02 - really I believe all that I need so
96:05 - first I'm gonna have a variable let's
96:08 - just do the whole thing all at once so
96:10 - we can animate it have it grow we'll
96:13 - figure out that stuff as we go but first
96:14 - let me just try to draw the entire not
96:16 - so I need to have a variable I'm gonna
96:20 - call it beta which equals zero and I'm
96:23 - going to say while beta is less than PI
96:27 - right isn't that what it said zero to PI
96:31 - that's the range the first thing I'm
96:34 - gonna do is these so I'm going to say
96:40 - convert these now I'm going to say float
96:43 - R equals this formula float theta equals
96:50 - it can someone in the chat confirm that
96:52 - I'm pronouncing the Greek letter fee
96:53 - correctly I know some people say five
96:55 - but I think it's actually fee so great
96:57 - I'm gonna add my semicolons so now I
96:59 - have calculated and are a theta and a
97:02 - fee so once and this should say
97:05 - cap pie has to be all capital letters
97:07 - for the constant now what I'm gonna do
97:11 - now is take these now I'm actually in
97:13 - some ways done I have the polar the
97:15 - spherical coordinates for this knot
97:16 - pattern but what I need to do is that P
97:20 - processing only knows about Cartesian
97:22 - coordinates X Y Z so that's what this
97:24 - next step is whoops so I need to get
97:27 - these formulas and I can say float X
97:32 - float Y and float Z and just make sure I
97:36 - put in my semicolons and then let's just
97:42 - I was gonna let's use well what let's
97:45 - just go for broke here I want to well
97:47 - one thing is I need beta to increase so
97:49 - I'm gonna say beta plus equals zero
97:50 - point one and I'm just gonna say begin
97:53 - shape and shape it's this gonna work
97:57 - I'm gonna say no fill stroke 255 and I'm
98:06 - just gonna set a vertex vertex at XYZ
98:11 - oops let's run this what did I get
98:16 - is there anything there well first of
98:18 - all I forget the origin point is the top
98:21 - left corner in processing so let's
98:24 - translate to the middle
98:32 - and let's run this again I'm hoping to
98:36 - see just look there's something there's
98:39 - my knot pattern look oh it's beautiful
98:42 - look at the not matter so what happened
98:43 - I'm getting values and it's making some
98:46 - pattern but those values are probably
98:48 - really really tiny so I need to do is
98:50 - really expand it out I couldn't use
98:51 - scale or something but let's actually
98:53 - just try I have a feeling that if I just
98:56 - take our and kind of multiply that whole
99:00 - our our being that radius by like
99:03 - something like 100 I'm going to see
99:07 - something more looking like they're not
99:09 - there we go look at that that kind of
99:12 - looks like it now it's very jagged so I
99:15 - probably need finer detail so let's
99:18 - increase beta by less let's just try
99:22 - like 0.01 so now I actually have like a
99:24 - hundred points for every I don't know
99:26 - ten points for every one point I had
99:29 - before there we go now we're definitely
99:34 - talking now is this really 3d I believe
99:36 - it is but let's confirm that by let's
99:40 - have an angle and let's just do a little
99:44 - bit of rotation like rotate Y by that
99:46 - angle and increase the angle by some
99:50 - small amount there we go so you can see
99:55 - and that's going really fast so let's
99:57 - slow that down it could map it to the
100:01 - mouse or something so you can see there
100:04 - is the not so first of all boom done we
100:06 - may have this not and now there's just
100:09 - so much that we could do
100:10 - let's try adjusting the formulas a
100:13 - little bit so let's try top side front
100:17 - yes not five so this are some oh look
100:21 - there's even some source code here that
100:22 - I could have copied so I'm heat not whoa
100:26 - look at this there's all these different
100:28 - possibilities so actually so what I'm
100:30 - going to do as an exercise I'm gonna let
100:32 - people explore who I really would like
100:34 - to do this one I'm gonna let people
100:37 - explore and try to make other versions
100:39 - of these knots and let's just try what I
100:43 - want to do is show you a little bit more
100:44 - about different ways you could render
100:45 - the not so one thing that I think is
100:47 - worth looking at is how could I have
100:50 - that not animate its path well first of
100:53 - all how could I make it can I say
100:56 - strokeweight
100:57 - in 3d will that make that cuz a stroke
101:00 - in 3d is really like a tube let's see
101:03 - let's see how that looks
101:05 - yeah so that made it a little thicker I
101:07 - think if I say eight all right so this
101:11 - is worth doing I could also probably
101:13 - mess around with the color so I could
101:16 - say like stroke XYZ or something and
101:19 - it's gonna give me like an RGB value
101:22 - according to its XYZ value this is just
101:24 - like normal material in p5 so you can
101:27 - see it start to play with the colors of
101:28 - the pattern but what I really want to do
101:30 - and let me sort of feel like doing this
101:37 - actually so the R could be the Jeep so
101:39 - let's just do this weather so if we see
101:41 - the difference what I really want to do
101:42 - now is I want to show you how to animate
101:44 - this pattern how do we do that so the
101:47 - way that we do that is instead of
101:48 - drawing all of the vertices all at once
101:52 - what if I store them all into an array
101:55 - and then and then create the shape one
101:59 - at a time so there's there's a variety
102:01 - of ways I could do this what I'm
102:03 - actually gonna do is I think what I'm
102:05 - gonna do is I'm gonna use an ArrayList
102:06 - and call on with Poppy vector RP vector
102:09 - is a kind of object that stores an XYZ
102:11 - and I'm gonna say vectors equals a new
102:16 - ArrayList P vector and what I'm going to
102:22 - do is I'm gonna now make beta a global
102:27 - variable and instead of while beta is
102:32 - less than PI I'm just going to every let
102:37 - me take all this out I mean I'm gonna
102:40 - need this stuff I'm gonna I'm gonna move
102:42 - actually what would make more sense is I
102:44 - want to what I want to do let me take
102:47 - out the while I want to put all the
102:48 - drawing stuff separate so the drawing
102:51 - stuff is going to happen down here and
102:54 - it's still going to involve a loop so I
102:57 - want to say ever
102:58 - vector inside of vectors set of vertex
103:03 - at V X V Y V Z so this is now just this
103:08 - is now just saying hey draw all the
103:10 - vectors as a shape so now what my job
103:13 - becomes is adding these points one at a
103:18 - time
103:18 - so every time through draw beta goes up
103:21 - by a little bit and what I do is I say
103:24 - vectors and I think it's ad in Java and
103:27 - ArrayList add new P vector at that XYZ
103:31 - so I got rid of my loop and I'm just
103:34 - calculating one XYZ every frame and
103:37 - adding it and what this should do is if
103:40 - I run this I should see it drawing that
103:44 - path this is pretty good now ah so I
103:48 - forgot um one thing is I lost the color
103:52 - so I could do something where I you know
103:55 - calculate make an object for a vertex
103:58 - that has the color and the XYZ so I
104:01 - could there's probably a lot of ways I
104:02 - could think about organizing this right
104:05 - now I think what I might just do is set
104:07 - the stroke here and one thing I could do
104:09 - is I mean this is redundant but uh so
104:13 - this is very inefficient but I can ask
104:16 - for the oh I could just say I could ask
104:22 - for the magnitude for example of the
104:26 - vector that's its length and I could say
104:29 - something like - whoops I could say
104:32 - stroke 255 magnitude 255 so the length
104:37 - of the vector right how far it is from
104:38 - the center has something to do with its
104:41 - color so you can see now against again
104:44 - I've kind of got that coloring back in
104:46 - oh this is so lovely well this actually
104:49 - worked out quite well so I think I'm
104:52 - going to stop here and quit while I'm
104:53 - ahead so to speak there's probably a lot
104:56 - of things you could think about doing
104:57 - you could look at Ruby's code which I
105:00 - think we'll have more examples can you
105:02 - create any of these other patterns can
105:05 - you think of other ways of rendering
105:08 - them could you make some nice gif
105:10 - animations so if you may
105:12 - something share it there's three ways
105:14 - you can share well there's a link to the
105:16 - source code for this challenge in the
105:18 - description there's a readme there so
105:20 - you can add a link to that readme you
105:21 - can tweet me at Schiffman or just use
105:24 - hashtag than why not
105:26 - why k and ot hashtag why not and I on
105:33 - Twitter I'm at Schiffman and I'd love to
105:35 - see all the different beautiful knots
105:37 - you make and at someone I will look into
105:39 - remaking this in p5.js okay thanks for
105:42 - watching this coding challenge have a
105:44 - good day okay that was shockingly I
105:51 - didn't even I didn't even use the
105:53 - whiteboard I think I have time for the
105:58 - custom shapes
105:59 - I totally have time for the custom
106:01 - shapes we're gonna do the custom shapes
106:03 - I mean I know I should read random
106:04 - numbers but I totally have time for the
106:08 - custom shapes quick quick quick quick
106:11 - everybody
106:38 - let's do the load model one because that
106:42 - basically had what I wanted
106:56 - and I totally do not have time for this
106:59 - but I'm gonna try kittens I need the
107:02 - kittens I need the kittens kittens must
107:04 - come with me everywhere custom shapes
107:29 - okay okay I'm great so here we are this
107:43 - drives me crazy for no good reason
107:46 - and let's minimize this
107:52 - let me find but I will not forget about
107:55 - donating to project awesome I think I'm
107:57 - gonna just do that for my when I log out
108:01 - of this view of the computer and log
108:03 - back into the other one and I will tweet
108:06 - and I'm just looking at this okay
108:10 - alright and which version of the p5
108:17 - library is this hold on I just have to
108:19 - check something no so we might run into
108:25 - a huh all right we're gonna give this a
108:29 - try alright everybody works on both
108:37 - versions okay thank you thank you for
108:39 - testing that for me all right I'm gonna
108:42 - try to hurry this up here does it make
108:45 - me so happy if I get this kind of done
108:52 - okay I've got another webgl in p5 video
108:57 - for you and in this one instead of
108:59 - drawing all I erased everything on the
109:00 - whiteboard that's fine I don't need to
109:02 - go over there in my list instead of
109:04 - drawing a primitive shaped like a cube a
109:06 - sphere a torus a cone etc I am going to
109:10 - make my own shape with begin shape and
109:12 - end shape so let's look at how that
109:15 - works so this has a box with a kitten as
109:18 - the texture when I've done I want to see
109:21 - just a custom shape also with the kitten
109:23 - as a texture let's see if we can make
109:25 - this work okay
109:27 - so let's take out the box let's take out
109:31 - the texture just for now and let's say
109:33 - normal material hopefully this is going
109:36 - to work now what I'm going to do is I'm
109:38 - just going to say begin shape and
109:42 - and shape and I have another video
109:44 - tutorial just about how begin shape and
109:46 - shape and vertex works and you can go
109:48 - refer to that one once you're into the
109:50 - 3d world there's a lot of possibilities
109:52 - we could tile with triangle strips and
109:54 - do all sorts of different things but I'm
109:55 - gonna just make a single shape that has
109:58 - that has vertices and it's like a
110:02 - basically like a quad I'm gonna make a
110:04 - quad so I'm gonna say vertex just to
110:07 - start 0-0 vertex 100 comma zero vertex
110:14 - 100 comma 100 vertex zero comma 100 and
110:20 - I think an important thing that I need
110:22 - to have here is close so what am i doing
110:25 - I have 0 0 100 comma 0
110:32 - 100 comma 100 zero comma 100 so I this
110:37 - is my path and all of a sudden out the
110:40 - clothes parameter in end shape makes the
110:44 - last vertex connect to the first vertex
110:47 - okay so let's see this is the equivalent
110:49 - of doing plain right this is like doing
110:51 - plain but I'm doing it with begin shape
110:53 - and in shape alright I don't see
110:57 - anything
110:58 - let's try fill there we go alright so
111:05 - normal material didn't work but that's
111:07 - fine fill works
111:08 - can I get ambient material to work no
111:18 - hmm
111:21 - Oh p5 so I'm gonna have to investigate
111:24 - those bugs so those seem like they might
111:29 - be bugs right now I'll have to
111:30 - investigate those who come back in this
111:31 - video or write something in the
111:32 - description but I really wanted to show
111:35 - you something about texturing and first
111:37 - of all let me just put Phil back the
111:38 - thing that I want to show you that's
111:40 - important is once I have these custom
111:43 - vertices I can start to really do weird
111:44 - things like for example what if this
111:46 - last vertex over here you know was a
111:50 - little bit more to the right I now have
111:53 - this kind of quad that's not a standard
111:55 - square and also like maybe I want to
111:58 - it's a sort of like Center itself so
112:00 - right now I could say just really
112:03 - quickly I mean I could redo all these
112:05 - vertices but I'm just gonna translate by
112:06 - like negative 50 comma zero and so now I
112:10 - kind of have this quad moving around at
112:13 - the center a bit more so let me put this
112:15 - back and we can see this is just like
112:19 - plain negative 50 I'm sorry negative 50
112:23 - comma negative 50 it should be okay
112:25 - so now this is just like plain I have
112:29 - lighting in here already so that's why
112:31 - the ambient materials should have shown
112:33 - up because I have lighting already okay
112:40 - so time after the Alka it seemed like
112:43 - everything in p5 web gels broken so
112:45 - first of all everything in p5 WebGL has
112:47 - pretty much been broken always people
112:51 - have WebGL is a totally new piece of p5
112:54 - totally new and it's been around for a
112:56 - year or so but it's been worked on
112:58 - completely redone over the summer so I
113:00 - think it hasn't gotten a lot of use
113:01 - which is one of the reasons why I'm
113:03 - making these videos is to find a lot of
113:04 - these bugs so hopefully and things just
113:07 - maybe haven't also had just haven't been
113:08 - implemented yet all right who get
113:13 - distracted by chat I can't not be
113:14 - distracted by the chat all right all
113:17 - right so now what I want to do is
113:21 - texture this geometry so what's
113:23 - interesting about this is let's just say
113:25 - I add right now texture oops I'm going
113:31 - to take texture kitten
113:33 - instead of film interesting website I
113:37 - don't see it why now something's
113:38 - happening but I don't see the kitten why
113:40 - not so this is what's really interesting
113:42 - about working with textures and custom
113:45 - shapes a vertex is defined by its X Y
113:51 - point or really in this case X Y Z
113:54 - that's what this is this is really zero
113:56 - zero zero
113:57 - 100 zero zero right I just sort of
114:00 - ignoring the Z but I probably put that
114:01 - in there if I want to take image data
114:05 - like a JPEG or a PNG or whatever and
114:10 - basically place that image data inside
114:13 - of that polygon the thing that I'm
114:16 - defining I need to say hey zero zero
114:20 - goes with what pixel this pixel 100 zero
114:24 - goes with what pixel this pixel now this
114:26 - would be kind of like a literal mapping
114:28 - of saying like this image gets mapped
114:30 - exactly on to it
114:31 - but what you see about this is you can
114:33 - start to do a lot of different things I
114:34 - will also refer you to a video about a
114:37 - flag simulation that I also have that
114:40 - does the same exact thing but with a
114:41 - more complex geometry so for the vertex
114:46 - function instead of just X Y Z I can
114:50 - also have u V the U and V coordinates
114:55 - are the pixel mappings on the image and
114:57 - I believe in p5 by default these are
115:02 - normalized so there are different ways
115:06 - this can be done but what I mean by
115:08 - normalized is this is actually 0 0 this
115:11 - is 1 0 this is 1 1 and this is 0 comma 1
115:15 - even if this is a 640 by 480 image so
115:20 - basically so let's look at how that
115:22 - works I'm gonna come back over here oops
115:36 - thank you thank you thank you and let
115:39 - that sound at that finish I'm gonna come
115:48 - back over here and let's start adding
115:50 - those UV coordinates in so I think this
115:53 - should be so let me add the zero in
115:55 - because I have a feeling it might not
115:58 - it's probably not gonna figure it out
115:59 - properly without the zero so I'm going
116:03 - to now say this is 0 0 this is 1 comma 0
116:07 - this is 1 comma 1 UV and this is 0 comma
116:12 - 1 so let's try that there we go there's
116:16 - the cat on our custom shape now it's so
116:21 - dark let's just pump up the ambient
116:26 - light here all right so I just wanted to
116:29 - add ambient more ambient light so we
116:30 - could see it now here's the thing that's
116:32 - interesting these mapping you now have a
116:36 - lot of creative possibilities like for
116:38 - example what if I just took out this
116:41 - point right what if I put this what if I
116:43 - made this a triangle and kind of moved
116:46 - this point to 50 comma 50 so let's try
116:52 - that
116:52 - so this lap this vertex is actually
116:55 - going to be 50 comma 50 and we should
116:58 - see look and you can see how it's sort
117:00 - of trying to figure out as best as it
117:02 - can how to kind of squish the kitten in
117:05 - and probably in this case just this
117:07 - rotation stuff is more trouble than it's
117:09 - worth
117:09 - you can see this is what it's done how
117:11 - it's decided to try to smush the kitten
117:14 - into that geometry and this of course
117:16 - could move like I could say Mouse X
117:19 - Mouse Y which is going to produce a
117:22 - really weird results but you can see
117:24 - this is me kind of like stretching so
117:26 - you could imagine you could have an
117:27 - algorithm that's changing the geometry I
117:29 - could have many many more points there's
117:33 - so many possibilities here another thing
117:35 - that I might that I'd love to show that
117:37 - I think's worth showing is what if I
117:39 - reverse so take a look at this kitten
117:42 - see that kitten it's
117:44 - looking that direction what if I flip
117:48 - the pixels and say this pixel should go
117:53 - with one comma zero and this should go
117:57 - with zero comma zero this should go 0
118:00 - comma 1 and this should go with 1 comma
118:01 - 1
118:02 - now the kittens look in the other
118:05 - direction what if I didn't flip the
118:07 - bottom I'm good no kittens will be
118:10 - harmed turning this like now that's
118:13 - something weird crazy happen because the
118:14 - top was flipped and had to like twist it
118:16 - to get the bottom so and these can be
118:18 - variables right this could be these
118:20 - could be variables that are changing and
118:21 - oscillating I could you know if I go all
118:24 - the way back whoops let me get that let
118:31 - me get our kitten back there I could do
118:33 - something like I actually only want to
118:34 - see the top half of the kitten so the Y
118:37 - or both 0.5 now that's the top half
118:39 - stretched into this stretch into this
118:41 - shape so there's a lot of I'm really
118:43 - just scratching the surface here but as
118:46 - you start to make your own shapes you
118:49 - can texture them and assign different
118:51 - pixels of different images and different
118:53 - parts of an image to different vertices
118:57 - of that sounds of that shape all right
119:01 - so hopefully this was helpful
119:03 - hold on my cap would ready yeah you know
119:09 - there's still again after the time of
119:10 - this recording there seem to be some
119:12 - bugs with how custom shapes work in p5
119:15 - WebGL hopefully any of you watching like
119:17 - decide to file a bug or look into fixing
119:20 - a bug in a friendly and supportive way
119:24 - and hopefully and please tag me at
119:27 - Schiffman on github if you post an issue
119:29 - related to this video or of course you
119:31 - can also ask at forum processing org in
119:34 - the p5.js category if you have kind of
119:36 - questions about how this stuff works so
119:38 - thank you very much
119:40 - and I look forward to seeing your custom
119:42 - geometry with textures in P 5gs alright
119:47 - everybody
119:54 - all right I'm looking at the chat okay
120:00 - oh boy all right hopefully that was
120:04 - helpful so what do we have left a few
120:09 - random numbers a few questions quad and
120:14 - triangle strips let's see here
120:24 - let's find the so someone named coding
120:29 - train random numbers no shoot oh yeah I
120:41 - think this is the channel this is a
120:48 - totally different YouTube channel which
120:51 - I feel totally happy for it to exist
120:55 - wait a sec here let's make sure this is
120:58 - legit here okay that's fine that's
121:03 - actually mine so um so that's very nice
121:06 - of you coding train random numbers to
121:08 - include a link of but you should just be
121:10 - clear I think because whoops anyway
121:15 - that's the patreon for the official
121:16 - coding train Channel but that's a small
121:18 - detail here okay so 0 1 2 3 that's the
121:21 - last one so this is where I last left
121:22 - off
121:23 - oh this was me yesterday with my net
121:32 - neutrality protest but hold on but did
121:37 - this really end the introduction well I
121:42 - only read the first two paragraphs of
121:44 - the introduction
121:53 - what whoops no no don't watch that
122:02 - nobody hold on okay so I don't know
122:28 - should I read the introduction or not
122:35 - random numbers audio book do the
122:40 - introduction now just get to the random
122:44 - numbers decide later all right
122:49 - here we go I've got another straw poll
122:56 - for everybody here the question is
122:58 - should I be just reading the random
123:01 - numbers you should play the video of you
123:04 - playing the video of you playing this to
123:05 - you should I be reaped you should I just
123:09 - go for the random numbers cuz I got it
123:10 - there's a lot of random numbers for me
123:12 - to get through or is that just am I
123:14 - missing something I should really make
123:15 - sure I read all the introduction which
123:17 - by the way has a lot of numbers in it
123:18 - also before I get to the random numbers
123:21 - this is how I'm going to decide
123:23 - everything in my entire life from now
123:25 - fine I'll walk around tweeting out straw
123:28 - polls that audio oh the audios bad is it
123:35 - is it just the music or something hold
123:38 - on one thing is that I have done
123:46 - something to my setup here to be more
123:50 - sophisticated which is that I can
123:52 - actually monitor the audio
123:56 - hello so it sounds so k sounds okay to
124:10 - me so interestingly enough if if that
124:15 - second time I play the music just now
124:17 - still had an audio glitch the glitch is
124:20 - happening somewhere else because it in
124:26 - my monitor it sounds fine alright still
124:32 - ok so I'm not I'm done with the sound
124:34 - board you're probably like unplug plug
