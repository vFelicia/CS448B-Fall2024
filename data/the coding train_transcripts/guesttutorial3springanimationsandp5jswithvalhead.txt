00:00 - hello welcome to another guest tutorial
00:01 - today we have for you Val head val is a
00:05 - web technologists she is the author of
00:07 - designing interface animation I highly
00:11 - recommend you check out her book and
00:12 - with Sara Dresner who you might have
00:14 - seen in another guest tutorial video she
00:17 - and Sarah traveled internationally to do
00:19 - workshops called learn web animation
00:21 - from the experts web animation workshops
00:24 - comm so you can check out the link to
00:26 - Val's book and web animation workshops
00:29 - we're tough in the video description
00:31 - look at this next workshop is in New
00:33 - York u December 8th that's tomorrow
00:35 - so if you're I don't know if you're
00:37 - probably kick travel back in time and
00:38 - fly to New York but check out here for
00:40 - their next location and hopefully want
00:41 - to check out their workshops so umm
00:43 - Val's going to show you how to make a
00:44 - nice little springy animation using p5
00:46 - GS which is a framework that I use in a
00:48 - lot of my videos and we were just
00:49 - talking about how a lot of times when
00:50 - people do is go and try to find this
00:52 - like complicated physics engine to do
00:53 - that but you can actually do it quite
00:54 - simply in a way that Val is going to
00:56 - show you how to do which is really
00:57 - exciting so we hope you enjoy the
00:59 - tutorial yes so hi everyone I'm Val head
01:02 - and in this little short tutorial I'm
01:05 - gonna show you how to make some really
01:06 - easy spring animations a lot of times if
01:09 - you wanted to create things maybe that
01:11 - looked like this or even like something
01:14 - that follows your mouse a little bit
01:15 - like that people will pull in like a
01:17 - whole physics engine or an entire
01:19 - library just to get a little bit of
01:21 - springiness to make it like real physics
01:22 - but i'm going to show you how to kind of
01:25 - fake the physics and make your own
01:27 - spring easing yourself in a very easy
01:29 - way and I'm going to show you this using
01:31 - p5.js so it'll be in canvas with
01:34 - JavaScript but really you can use this
01:36 - technique anywhere you kind of have
01:37 - access to like run a function every
01:39 - frame so you could do it in like regular
01:41 - JavaScript with a function running on
01:42 - requestanimationframe or any other
01:45 - programming language where you have a
01:46 - function running every frame because
01:48 - we're basically just going to update
01:49 - some math on every frame of the
01:51 - animation so right now to start out I
01:53 - have this little pink ball and it is
01:55 - following the X to the x position of my
01:58 - mouse so it's just following my mouse
02:00 - along the x position wherever it goes
02:02 - and it's kind of well boring because
02:05 - it's not doing any fun stuff like
02:06 - springing yet so to make it that happen
02:08 - right now we've just got a target of our
02:10 - mouse
02:10 - position which is the mouse x from p5.js
02:13 - and we're just saying like hey ball go
02:15 - use the position of our mouse for your x
02:18 - position so we're drawing the circle at
02:19 - you know the mouse position and 200 so
02:22 - it's just moving along that x axis but
02:24 - let's make this a little bit more
02:25 - springy so we have two values that we're
02:29 - going to use for the spring and they're
02:30 - just up here we've got one value for
02:32 - drag which is a value that needs to be
02:34 - less than one for it to work because
02:36 - we're going to take this away from the
02:38 - velocity of each frame so if it's one
02:40 - nothing gets taken away and if it's less
02:42 - than one a little bit gets taken away if
02:44 - it's like point zero one a whole ton
02:46 - gets taken away and that probably won't
02:48 - look good but we'll see that in a second
02:49 - and then we have this variable of
02:51 - strength which essentially represents
02:53 - the strength of our spring and that has
02:55 - to be very small or it doesn't have to
02:56 - be very small but it looks best when
02:57 - it's very small a good way to think
03:00 - about it actually if you are doing these
03:02 - sort of spring animations you can
03:04 - imagine the thing that you're animating
03:05 - is like attached to a fixed point with a
03:07 - spring kind of like this image from the
03:09 - wiki Commons right here where this
03:12 - rectangle is attached to something with
03:14 - a spring and when you pull it away it
03:16 - just kind of like oscillates back and
03:17 - forth until it eventually gets goes back
03:19 - to rest so a lot of the physics engines
03:22 - or if you want to get super physics see
03:24 - about it you might use something like
03:25 - Hookes law and know the spring constant
03:27 - but we're not gonna do any of that we're
03:29 - essentially going to create two forces
03:31 - one pulling the spring away from where
03:33 - it wants to be and some forces pulling
03:34 - it back as well so if you're into really
03:37 - exact physics sorry all right so back to
03:41 - our ball and we'll have our two
03:43 - variables for Dragon for strength so
03:45 - let's start actually using dragon
03:47 - strength while we calculate where our
03:49 - ball should be on any given frame so
03:51 - right now we have our position equals
03:53 - studying the position equal to Mouse X
03:55 - but I'm going to get rid of that so we
03:56 - can make it more interesting and we'll
03:58 - start calculating exactly the position
04:01 - the ball should be in kind of like the
04:02 - velocity it should have for each
04:04 - individual frame because you always want
04:06 - it to be heading towards the mouse
04:07 - position and then it'll get closer and
04:09 - closer and eventually rest there after
04:11 - springing around a little bit we don't
04:12 - want it to get there like right away we
04:14 - want it to be kind of a little bit
04:16 - behind where the mouse is so I'm going
04:18 - to start by creating a variable called
04:19 - force and this is going to be our target
04:22 - which is
04:24 - is - the position of where our ball is
04:27 - right now the idea being that this
04:30 - particular spring animation is based on
04:32 - the mouse position and when the mouse
04:33 - moves the ball is going to go there if
04:35 - the mouse moves really far we'll
04:37 - consider that stretching the spring
04:38 - really far and have it'll have a lot of
04:40 - force if we move the mouse only a little
04:42 - bit we're just stretching the spring a
04:43 - tiny little bit and we don't have as
04:45 - much force so that's kind of faking that
04:47 - sense of the the force that's pulling
04:50 - the spring apart or the action that's
04:51 - pulling the spring away from where it
04:53 - wants to be so we'll take our other
04:55 - force and we'll actually like
04:57 - x equal it to our strength so what we're
04:59 - essentially doing is saying our strength
05:00 - equals itself times the force what this
05:04 - is gonna do since our strength is a very
05:05 - small number it's gonna take a little
05:07 - bit away from the force which makes
05:09 - sense right if you're pulling the spring
05:10 - and the spring is a very strong rigid
05:12 - spring it's gonna take a lot more force
05:14 - to to pull it apart so we kind of faked
05:16 - that better the physics by multiplying
05:19 - the number of force which should be
05:20 - something somewhat large if our mouse
05:21 - moves far by a small number of our
05:24 - strength which was point one I believe
05:27 - so we'll multiply that by our strength
05:29 - and we have some strength there too so
05:31 - now we want to adjust the velocity of
05:33 - the ball because for each frame in that
05:36 - ball can have some velocity when it
05:38 - first starts out it'll be zero of course
05:39 - it hasn't moved at all but as soon as we
05:41 - move our mouse and the ball starts
05:42 - moving it'll have some existing velocity
05:45 - and we don't want to completely wipe
05:46 - that out so we'll use our velocity which
05:49 - is a variable we declared further up and
05:50 - we're going to times equal that to our
05:53 - drag so that's going to do a very
05:55 - similar thing to our force the velocity
05:57 - is how far the ball wants to go but drag
05:59 - is kind of taking away from that
06:01 - velocity can remember our drag is equal
06:04 - to 0.75 so whatever our velocity is
06:06 - we're taking away just 0.25 of it on
06:10 - every frame so it's getting slowed down
06:12 - a little bit on every frame then we'll
06:15 - take our velocity and we will add our
06:17 - force to it plus equals force
06:23 - and that's going to since the force is
06:26 - what's pulling it kind of a way are like
06:28 - lengthening this spring if you want to
06:29 - think of it that way
06:30 - I'm the velocity and force are working
06:32 - together in the same direction so we'll
06:33 - add that force on there after we've
06:35 - taken away the drag and then once we're
06:37 - done those simple multiplications and
06:39 - additions and totally fake physics we
06:42 - can set our position which is the x
06:44 - position rather of our ball to what
06:46 - we've just found out for velocities so
06:47 - our position is plus equals our velocity
06:49 - the idea being that for every frame our
06:52 - velocity is going to be some you know
06:53 - essentially positive amount or some
06:56 - amount that it makes the ball move
06:58 - further than it is right now or maybe
07:00 - the other way you know it might go in
07:01 - either direction but by adding the
07:03 - velocity the current position we just
07:05 - keep moving along in our spring whether
07:06 - it's left or right or however it is so
07:09 - then once we have that in our draw loop
07:12 - we're also drawing our circle like we
07:14 - saw before and we're drawing it at the
07:15 - position which is the thing we did all
07:18 - that kind of fake physics math for
07:20 - drawing it right there and at 200 pixels
07:22 - so if we save this and run it assuming I
07:25 - did everything right Oh run now we have
07:30 - a little bit of spring to our ball
07:32 - so it's following our mouse position
07:34 - only on the x axis but we have a spring
07:36 - just on that x axis as well of course
07:39 - this is a lot more fun when you do it on
07:41 - both the x and y axis which will you
07:44 - know give you something a little bit
07:45 - more like this and in this particular
07:46 - one I also did it with p5.js and I use
07:49 - vectors to do the x and y coordinates
07:51 - together at the same time because that's
07:53 - pretty fun to save that time but by
07:55 - doing it in both the x and y axis it's a
07:57 - lot more fun to show you a little bit
08:00 - how the drag and the strength factors
08:02 - work together I made this little pen so
08:04 - this is the one that we were just
08:05 - looking at with our drag factor of 0.75
08:07 - and our strength of 0.1 it's kind of you
08:10 - know soft springy if we raise that drag
08:13 - even more so we take less away from the
08:16 - velocity every time we get a very much
08:18 - more springy spring this one will make
08:22 - you dizzy if we increase the strength of
08:24 - our spring which is essentially like the
08:26 - spring being so rigid or just like made
08:28 - of really you know something that
08:29 - resists being pulled and we get a much
08:31 - more like staccato kind of spring with
08:35 - this little s
08:36 - with this little drag it looks kind of
08:39 - like we have blurred vision so mo you
08:41 - might take our drag down a little bit
08:42 - and this is just like a really subtle
08:44 - one so you can see even with just these
08:46 - two variables of like dragons strength
08:49 - you can create some very different
08:50 - Springs just with some simple
08:52 - multiplication it's not real physics
08:54 - it's not you know emulating any
08:56 - particular spring in the real world but
08:58 - it does look pretty springing and it's
09:00 - really responsive so why not some places
09:03 - is pretty good for we saw it as like a
09:05 - mouse chaser thing that's fun anything
09:07 - that's like scaling up and down on
09:09 - interaction this was a particular fun
09:11 - one to make that could be like a menu or
09:13 - something where you just have various
09:15 - thoughts bringing out of each other out
09:17 - of the same position there's a lot you
09:18 - can do with Springs and Springs don't
09:20 - have to be hard you can kind of invent
09:22 - them yourself just with a little bit of
09:23 - dragon strength multiplication so I hope
09:26 - you found that tutorial fun and it was
09:28 - really great to be on this channel with
09:30 - you
09:35 - [Music]
09:40 - you
