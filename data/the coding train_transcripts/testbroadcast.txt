00:37 - there we go
00:39 - aha okay I should be now live I didn't
00:42 - realize that that wasn't happening
00:45 - automatically um is this working can
00:48 - anyone hear me can you see me I think
00:51 - you can I see can see me
00:54 - now if you are on this page watching can
00:58 - you hear my voice
01:01 - speaking you could type in the chat I'm
01:03 - looking at the chat down
01:12 - here so far I have no independent
01:15 - confirmation that the audio is working
01:17 - but I do see some green bar moving up
01:20 - and down yes very clearly okay uh how uh
01:24 - so hi I am setting up a new video
01:28 - recording studio I look forward to
01:30 - announcing where I'm setting that up
01:32 - soon but I'm not sure yet if I'm ready
01:33 - to do that um as you all know I like to
01:37 - make video tutorials as you all know I
01:39 - don't know if you all know this but um
01:41 - as you might know my name is Dan uh I
01:45 - like to make video tutorials about
01:47 - programming uh I have a list of topics
01:49 - that I'm going to do but this is really
01:51 - just a test I'm seeing it here um there
01:55 - are 10 people watching this test so I
01:57 - you know while I'm here testing if
01:59 - anybody has has any questions about
02:01 - processing or p5js general questions
02:03 - about life the universe you can ask them
02:06 - now I'm probably going to turn this off
02:07 - in in a couple minutes and then I'm
02:09 - going to maybe wheel in a whiteboard
02:10 - here try to hook my laptop up and then
02:13 - actually do like a short video tutorial
02:15 - but I was just testing to see if this
02:16 - the internet connection is good enough
02:18 - here to live stream and uh if like the
02:23 - camera would work and all that in this
02:24 - different
02:25 - setup so I'm just looking at the chat
02:27 - here you probably I'm also want to see
02:30 - about how much the delay is so I'm going
02:33 - to um I'm going to what I'm going to do
02:35 - is I'm going to make a very obvious
02:39 - gesture which I can then see myself do
02:41 - because I've got a a view of the YouTube
02:43 - stream and I can count about how long
02:45 - that tested so what I'm going to do is
02:47 - I'm going to put the my arms above my
02:49 - head like
02:51 - this now I'm going to count I'm 1,000 2
02:54 - 1,000 3 1,000 4 1,000 5 1,000 6 1,000 7
02:59 - 1,000 8 1,000 91,000 10 1,000 so it's
03:03 - about a 10c delay so you're seeing me
03:05 - about 10 seconds after live what is the
03:07 - keyboard shortcut to comment multiple
03:10 - lines in p5js well I assume you mean the
03:14 - p5js
03:16 - desktop editor um obviously you can
03:19 - program JavaScript using any number of
03:22 - environments you can just open up
03:23 - Sublime Text there's web editors you can
03:25 - use but if you're using the desktop
03:27 - editor I believe it is command slash
03:32 - uh okay someone asked about 3D models in
03:35 - processing how do you import a 3D model
03:37 - into processing I'm going to the
03:39 - processing website and I'm going to the
03:42 - you can't see this I'm about to hook up
03:44 - so you can see my laptop but I this was
03:46 - just a test of equipment uh I'm going to
03:50 - the libraries page see I have a laptop
03:52 - here you can see uh
03:55 - 3D uh geometry
03:58 - maybe um
04:00 - well there is actually the um you can
04:04 - use pshape
04:07 - um um the p-shape object will load an
04:11 - obj but there is also there was an obj
04:14 - uh yeah
04:15 - obj
04:18 - obj there is a lot for processing that
04:21 - you could look into that was one
04:23 - question in the chat you need a library
04:25 - probably to do that okay where I'm
04:27 - looking
04:28 - here
04:30 - oops I have audio coming here uh just
04:33 - bought connect okay here's another
04:35 - question I'm answering just bought
04:37 - connect version two any suggestions
04:39 - about open CV and connect version 2 with
04:42 - CP C++ well I am not probably the right
04:45 - person to answer that question but I
04:47 - would certainly recommend looking into
04:48 - using open Frameworks uh so open
04:50 - Frameworks is a C++ framework for
04:53 - Creative coding um it's uh amazing for
04:57 - do it if you want to work in C++ and one
04:58 - of the great things about working in C++
05:00 - it's kind of native immediate access to
05:02 - a lot of computer vision libraries that
05:04 - are written in C++ and so open CV and
05:07 - connect stuff you can kind of do it all
05:08 - with that so that's what I would
05:09 - recommend okay next question how do you
05:12 - feel about Jamie Allen getting a PhD
05:14 - well completely against phds as a
05:17 - philosophical
05:18 - stance um but Jamie Allen is a wonderful
05:22 - person and if he wants to get a PhD then
05:24 - I I I I will make an exception here and
05:27 - think that sounds like a wonderful idea
05:30 - uh recommended readings on genetic
05:33 - algorithms okay that's a good question
05:35 - um so uh I probably started um one of
05:39 - the first things first places I
05:41 - encountered genetic algorithms is in the
05:43 - book The computational Beauty of nature
05:45 - by flake is the last name of the author
05:48 - I Gary flake maybe William flake I think
05:50 - it's Gary flake
05:53 - um they're here because on the natureof
05:57 - code.com I believe I have a page page
06:00 - under uh SL book which is further
06:04 - reading and there
06:08 - uh uh evolutionary design by computers
06:11 - is a good reference uh Peter Bentley I'm
06:14 - sure I have computational beauty of
06:16 - nature here on this page um
06:20 - another uh something that I'm thinking
06:22 - of is the um yeah Carl Sims papers
06:27 - there's two sigraph papers artificial
06:29 - Evolution for computer graphics and
06:31 - evolving virtual creatures these are
06:33 - both great references to look at okay
06:36 - next question this is fun just like
06:38 - question and answer
06:41 - session um okay there's no more I
06:44 - answered all the questions I so so the
06:45 - next thing I'm going to do I'm here is
06:47 - I'm gonna um I'm probably going to turn
06:48 - this off in a minute I'm G to hook up
06:51 - my uh laptop to see if I can get my
06:53 - laptop feed going into the live stream
06:55 - might sort of move these lights around a
06:57 - little bit so it's less shadowy I might
06:58 - get a whiteboard Bo um but ultimately uh
07:02 - next week my plan is to start uh doing
07:04 - regularly scheduled live broadcasts
07:07 - Tuesdays and Fridays twice a week um I
07:10 - have a list of I'm gonna paste this into
07:13 - the chat uh I have a list of uh I have a
07:17 - markdown file here I'm pasting this in
07:20 - this is my list of sort of topics I'm
07:22 - looking to do one of the first things I
07:23 - want to do is a whole set of tutorials
07:25 - on just git and GitHub uh for the and
07:28 - really without source code or
07:30 - programming involved whatsoever so what
07:32 - does it mean to write a poem and then
07:33 - have that poem sort of exist in the
07:35 - world of git and GitHub so um that's one
07:37 - of the first things I want to do is a
07:38 - set of tutorials U I was just rambling
07:42 - to see if more people would ask
07:43 - questions but I don't think there are
07:44 - somehow there's 18 people watching this
07:46 - which is kind of
07:47 - amazing
07:49 - uh MIT uh somebody somebody else posts
07:52 - that
07:54 - another um genetic algorithms reference
07:57 - is an MIT tutorial um okay okay I got to
07:59 - get put a get a desk in here that's a
08:01 - little bit higher so I not like bending
08:03 - down to look at this
08:04 - laptop okay this was an 8 minute
08:07 - broadcast I of quite of enjoying this
08:09 - but I see no reason to continue unless
08:11 - somebody has an idea I know that you're
08:13 - 10 seconds behind me so I'm going to
08:14 - wait about 10 seconds to see if there's
08:16 - any more questions otherwise I'm going
08:18 - to turn this off and hope to be back um
08:22 - relatively soon with u maybe an actual
08:25 - lesson where I will then be able to
08:27 - switch from me talking to you seeing my
08:29 - laptop screen and we'll I'll do I'll
08:31 - pick some programming problem to do as
08:32 - kind of a test lesson okay um thanks
08:36 - everybody for watching from this secret
08:40 - location I'm in an underground bunker
08:43 - there's walls but uh I look forward to
08:46 - talking more about this location that
08:48 - I'm in and I'm very excited to spend
08:49 - some time at and um and making more
08:53 - video tutorials okay ah Zack liberman
08:56 - Hello nice to see you Christopher a ke
08:59 - can I tap dance I actually cannot tap
09:01 - dance I could try to tap dance but I'm
09:03 - not going to okay
09:06 - um all right so I'm I'm I don't I forget
09:10 - how to turn this off I have to figure
09:11 - out how to do that I'm gonna I'm gonna
09:13 - I'm gonna uh uh give you guys a little
09:16 - clue into what I'm doing here so right
09:17 - now uh I'm on the laptop here I've got a
09:20 - view into my um let me zoom into this
09:24 - maybe you can see
09:26 - it
09:27 - hello uh
09:32 - oh there we
09:34 - go I have a big red button here I don't
09:37 - know if you can see this when I click
09:40 - this red button it should turn off the
09:42 - stream
09:44 - but that took me a few more seconds I'll
09:46 - check to see if there's any more
09:48 - questions
09:50 - whoops
09:52 - uh where am I
09:56 - here looks pretty dark yes uh I am
10:01 - hoping to purchase or acquire some uh
10:03 - LED lighting that I'm going to use right
10:05 - now there's just some clip lights in the
10:07 - underground bunker so it is dark there's
10:09 - a shadow uh I also need to fiddle with
10:11 - the camera white
10:13 - balance aperture I don't know any of
10:16 - this stuff it's pathetic but I'm going
10:18 - to fiddle with it it's a camera it has
10:20 - dials and buttons I will press those and
10:22 - turn those to see if I can make it look
10:24 - better okay that's definitely the end
10:26 - I'm going to do my dramatic uh click of
10:29 - the button I'm going to click this
10:31 - button over here which will turn off the
10:32 - stream and I will be back uh tweet at me
10:34 - if you have any ideas for something I
10:36 - might answer or do later today okay
10:39 - goodbye
