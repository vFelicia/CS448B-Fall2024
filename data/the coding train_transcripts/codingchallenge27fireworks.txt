00:00 - hello and welcome to another coding
00:02 - challenge in this coding challenge I'm
00:04 - going to program a fireworks
00:07 - simulation Bing um and I'm going to
00:10 - program it from scratch in JavaScript in
00:12 - the browser the version that's running
00:14 - actually behind me is a version that
00:15 - I've made in processing a Java base
00:17 - platform the code for the one behind me
00:19 - and the one that I will make in this
00:20 - video will both be available in links in
00:22 - the description and at the end of this
00:24 - video I'm I'm hoping to return back to
00:26 - this processing one and also uh turn it
00:28 - into 3D fireworks this might have a
00:30 - three-dimensional like quality to it but
00:32 - it's really just two Dimensions um okay
00:35 - so here we go so let me minimize this
00:38 - code which was the processing version
00:39 - get rid of that and I have a blank
00:41 - JavaScript can HTML 5 canvas and I have
00:43 - some JavaScript code so the first thing
00:45 - that I need to do is I need to have uh I
00:48 - want to have this idea of a particle I
00:50 - need to have a particle so I'm going to
00:53 - just write a particle
00:56 - uh a Constructor
00:58 - function uh where oh you know what I'm
01:00 - going to do is I'm going to the particle
01:02 - should have a position which will be a
01:04 - vector the particle I need to use
01:06 - physics here it's going to have a
01:07 - velocity which will right now be just
01:09 - zero and the particle is also going to
01:11 - have an acceleration so I'm going to
01:13 - kind of custom bake a physics engine
01:15 - this the same sort of model that I use
01:16 - in all my nature of code tutorials and
01:18 - videos about physics but I'm and I'm
01:19 - just going to kind of bake this from
01:21 - scratch really quickly and then I'm
01:23 - going to add a a function called
01:25 - update and that function does what it
01:28 - takes the velocity and adds it to the
01:32 - position and it takes the uh
01:37 - acceleration and adds it to the velocity
01:40 - now where does it get acceleration well
01:43 - that I need to have a function I'm going
01:44 - to call it apply force and in that
01:46 - function I'm going to get some sort of
01:48 - force and I'm going to add that Force to
01:51 - the acceleration this is the idea of
01:52 - force accumulation Force equals mass
01:55 - time acceleration or acceleration equals
01:58 - acceleration equals for Force equals
02:01 - mass time acceleration or acceleration
02:02 - equals force divided by mass but I'm
02:04 - going to eliminate mass in for
02:05 - Simplicity so acceleration equals force
02:07 - are all the forces of a moment added
02:09 - together so once I do that I also need
02:11 - to make sure that um after I update the
02:14 - particle each frame that I multiply its
02:17 - acceleration by zero to sort of clear it
02:19 - out because the acceleration at each
02:20 - moment in time is going to start with
02:22 - zero okay so now I'm kind of got this
02:26 - the last thing I need to do with this
02:27 - particle is I need to have a fun I'm
02:30 - going to call it show which draws just
02:32 - for Simplicity just draws the particle
02:34 - at um where where where makx it as a
02:38 - point this.position
02:40 - dox and this.position doy and what I'm
02:44 - going to do just for um one thing I
02:46 - learned recently about p5js which by the
02:48 - time you watch this video in the future
02:50 - may not really be the case anymore but
02:52 - if I set the stroke and the stroke
02:54 - weight up just in setup and don't set it
02:56 - over and over again it sometimes can run
02:58 - a lot faster um so just to test that
03:01 - things are working I'm going to U make a
03:03 - variable called a firework and I'm going
03:05 - to say that firework is a new
03:09 - particle which lives in the center of
03:11 - the window and I'm going to say here in
03:14 - background firework in draw I'm going to
03:16 - say firework do update and Firework doow
03:19 - so I want to now go back to my sketch
03:21 - and see ah I have some errors so
03:23 - particle. JS let me make this a little
03:24 - bit
03:25 - bigger that's really big but uh
03:28 - particle. Js line uh number six has an
03:32 - error uh let's see particle D this do
03:35 - apply Force equals ah function is
03:38 - spelled with a
03:39 - c me refresh there we go so you can see
03:42 - there's the particle in the center
03:43 - things are working so far uh the next
03:46 - thing I want to do is let me give let me
03:48 - have this particle
03:50 - start uh at a random width and all the
03:55 - way at the bottom of the window and let
03:57 - me give that particle a velocity
03:58 - pointing up so let me say its velocity
04:01 - is -4 pointing up let me run this there
04:05 - we go we can see it's going up each time
04:06 - I refresh it it starts in a new random
04:09 - location and starts going up so we're
04:10 - getting somewhere the next thing that I
04:13 - want to do is see if I can add some
04:16 - gravity so I'm going to make a Glo
04:17 - gravity a global variable and it's going
04:20 - to be a
04:22 - vector that does what it points down so
04:26 - negative uh no pointing down is positive
04:28 - so0 comma I'm going to say point two and
04:30 - then I'm also going to say firework do
04:32 - apply Force gravity so I'm now adding
04:35 - gravity to that particle so let's run
04:39 - this uh acceleration is not defined
04:42 - let's go back to the particle uh where
04:45 - where H this. acceleration I always
04:48 - forget the this Let me
04:51 - refresh H didn't make it very high but
04:53 - that's sort of reasonable so let's make
04:55 - the particle's velocity a lot bigger
04:57 - like -10
04:59 - okay so that's good so we can see so
05:01 - this is the start of our firework
05:03 - simulation something shooting up from
05:05 - the bottom and then at some point it's
05:07 - going to explode and make a lot of
05:08 - particles but before I could do that
05:10 - what I want to have is just have a lot
05:11 - of things shooting up from the bottom
05:13 - continuously so let's get that going so
05:15 - instead of having uh one single firework
05:19 - what I really want is to have an array
05:21 - of them and actually what I want is for
05:24 - the firework to be its own object so I'm
05:28 - going to create a firework
05:31 - uh uh function sorry and a Constructor
05:36 - function and the first thing I'm going
05:37 - to do is it's going to have a a local
05:40 - variable which is a so I'm I'm basically
05:42 - going to do what I did here right I want
05:44 - it to have in this firework object I
05:47 - want it to have a particle it's going to
05:49 - have that particle the firework itself
05:51 - can have an update function and whoops
05:55 - what happens in the update function it
05:57 - does all these these these things
06:00 - it adds gravity and updates that
06:02 - Firework and then I'm going to also have
06:03 - a show function for the firework
06:07 - object and I have a I can see I have a
06:09 - syntax
06:11 - error
06:13 - uh which I'm going to fix in a second so
06:16 - the idea here is the particle right a
06:19 - particle is an individual particle this
06:22 - firework object right now is one
06:24 - particle but the firework object is also
06:26 - going to in a moment not just be the
06:28 - particle moving up but suddenly all the
06:30 - particles that explode from it so I need
06:32 - this object to keep track of that
06:33 - individual particle and then also an
06:35 - array of particles but this should at
06:37 - least get me now if I say uh um firework
06:43 - do push new
06:46 - Firework and then I should be able to
06:49 - say firework dot uh I should be able to
06:52 - say oh Fire Works should be an array
06:55 - then I should be able to say look at all
06:58 - of the five Works do a length i++ and
07:03 - you know I could use a for each Loop but
07:05 - I'm choosing not to just for clarity um
07:07 - update
07:09 - fireworks uh indexi doow okay here we go
07:13 - so
07:15 - now okay firework is not defined in line
07:18 - six uh yep I need the as always I always
07:21 - forget the this dot this dot this dot
07:24 - I'm going to do the this this dot this
07:26 - dot this dot the this Dot Song never
07:27 - forget the this Dot somebody composed
07:30 - that song for me uh and run this again
07:33 - there you can see okay so it happened
07:35 - and now what I'm going to do
07:37 - is I have this line of code that puts a
07:40 - new firework object in the array and I
07:42 - could put that line of code in draw and
07:45 - if I put it in draw over and over and
07:47 - over again it's just making these
07:48 - fireworks making these fireworks I don't
07:49 - want to make them that often so I am
07:52 - going to say if random one is less than
07:55 - 0.1 so every frame there is a 10% chance
08:00 - of making a new firework let's try
08:03 - that that's a little bit better so it's
08:05 - making them kind of randomly every so
08:07 - often so that's a good start and now
08:09 - what I also want to do is you know I
08:12 - think this should be a random value so
08:13 - let's say random between 15
08:16 - and5 so that way they don't all go and
08:20 - so that the range might be off there let
08:22 - me make the range a little bit
08:25 - commer let's do this so anyway you get
08:28 - the idea that they're not they're also
08:30 - not all going to just go up to exactly
08:31 - the same height so now we're pretty good
08:33 - we've got our system of the fireworks
08:36 - going up over time but I need to figure
08:40 - out what's the point where I want them
08:41 - to go poof and explode into a bunch of
08:44 - particles okay so how do I do
08:47 - that here in the update function one
08:51 - thing I should edit Point timeout back
08:56 - um I what I need to do is I want to
08:59 - check something I could do is I say how
09:01 - do I know when the firework gets to the
09:02 - top Point well its velocity is negative
09:05 - its velocity is negative its velocity is
09:07 - negative in the y direction now it's
09:08 - zero now it's positive now it's positive
09:10 - I want it to explode the moment it
09:13 - reaches that top point so I can say if
09:15 - this
09:16 - firework dot velocity is Le pointing
09:21 - down is greater than zero is greater
09:23 - than or equal to zero this is the moment
09:26 - where I want it to explode so what I'm
09:28 - actually going to do is I'm going to say
09:30 - this. firework equals null so I'm just
09:33 - going to like set the firework to null
09:35 - so that um uh it's like that will make
09:39 - it disappear essentially so in the and
09:42 - I'm going to need some like I'm going to
09:44 - have to say if this. firework so I only
09:47 - want to update apply force and update it
09:50 - if it exists and I also only want to
09:53 - show it if it exists so let's just see
09:57 - you know there's lots of other ways I
09:58 - could do this but this is just going to
10:00 - be a sort of way of me tracking I could
10:03 - have actually a Boolean variable like
10:04 - exploded or something I might I might
10:05 - change it to that later but let's see
10:07 - how this
10:08 - works so oop H that's
10:13 - weird
10:14 - uh if this oh well that's if the Y
10:19 - component of the Velocity right if the Y
10:21 - component of the Velocity let's add that
10:24 - oh cannot read velocity of null where
10:26 - did that happen ah okay well this is a
10:28 - issue
10:30 - so this little bit can go inside here
10:33 - like also as long as it
10:36 - exists there you can see now it's
10:38 - disappearing the moment it kind of gets
10:41 - to the top so that's good and what I
10:43 - want is when it gets to the top I want
10:44 - it to just go into a whole bunch of
10:46 - particles so I actually kind of feel
10:49 - like I'm going to just change this just
10:51 - for to be I'm gonna say this do exploded
10:54 - is false as long as not this do exploded
10:58 - apply Force if it's then say this do
11:00 - exploded equals false
11:03 - because as long as
11:07 - this uh as long as not this dot exploded
11:10 - I I think I would prefer to use a
11:12 - Boolean
11:14 - variable uh it equals true so this
11:17 - should be the same exact result but I'm
11:18 - not doing the sort of null thing okay so
11:21 - I used a Boolean variable to track when
11:22 - it's exploded now what do I do when it
11:25 - explodes well what I need to do is I
11:27 - need to suddenly right here I'm gonna
11:30 - just say this.
11:33 - explode so I want to put this in a
11:35 - separate
11:36 - function and I'm going to write a
11:38 - function now called this.
11:40 - explode and what do I need to do in this
11:43 - function I need to make a whole lot of
11:44 - particles let's make a 100 of them so
11:46 - for VAR I equals z i is less than 100
11:50 - i++ what I need to do is say VAR P
11:52 - equals a new particle and where should
11:55 - that particle start so it's about to
11:58 - explode where should that particle start
11:59 - it should start where this. fireworks
12:02 - position dox and this.
12:05 - fireworks Doos
12:08 - doy so I need to make a whole lot of
12:10 - these particles and now I need an array
12:13 - the firework object in addition to
12:14 - keeping track of this sort of like seed
12:16 - firework should keep track of this do
12:19 - particles an
12:21 - array so it has an empty array and I am
12:24 - now going to
12:26 - say particles do
12:30 - push P okay particles push P now what I
12:35 - also then need to do
12:39 - is and I'm going to just do this here
12:41 - right
12:43 - here what I need to do is display all
12:46 - those particles index i. show so oh and
12:51 - this has to be this.
12:53 - particles and this has to be this.
12:55 - particles index I Dosh so what I've
12:57 - added here is the moment the particle
13:00 - reaches the top it makes 100 new
13:02 - particles and then draws all those so
13:05 - let's see what this looks
13:07 - like oops cannot read show of undefined
13:10 - firework JS index 30 oh this should be
13:13 - this. particles do length because I
13:17 - don't want it to show non-existent
13:19 - particles that array is only going to
13:20 - have 100 as soon as as soon as it is
13:22 - exploded let's run this
13:25 - again look at that oh it made 100
13:28 - particles none of which move or do
13:30 - anything pretty weird right well first
13:32 - of all why aren't they moving well I
13:34 - forgot
13:35 - something I forgot that I also should
13:39 - call uh here in
13:43 - update I should also call for all those
13:46 - particles apply
13:48 - force uh
13:50 - gravity and for all those particles I
13:53 - have to update them so I need those
13:54 - particles to experience physics as well
13:59 - look what's happening it's making those
14:01 - fireworks but they're all why what
14:03 - happens when you make a new particle it
14:05 - shoots straight up so I need to make
14:07 - those particles in a different way so
14:09 - let's look at how I'm doing that if I go
14:11 - back to the particle object the particle
14:13 - is always made with a
14:15 - velocity that randomly points up between
14:18 - -2 and8 so I could use like inheritance
14:22 - and have like a different two different
14:23 - kinds of particles that inherit but I
14:25 - think what I'm going to do is just I'll
14:28 - just add a third
14:29 - argument here and I'll call it uh
14:34 - Exploder and I'll
14:36 - say if Exploder I don't like Exploder
14:40 - that sounds violent I'm already using
14:41 - explode I guess uh I'm going to call it
14:45 - um
14:47 - firework uh if
14:50 - firework make the velocity that way
14:55 - otherwise make the velocity and I'm I
14:59 - I'm just going to do something different
15:00 - just so what I'm going to do is I'm
15:01 - going to say I want to say P5 Vector
15:05 - random 2D so I'm going to have any
15:07 - random Direction okay so if that's
15:10 - Boolean variable is true it's going to
15:13 - make it as like one of those original
15:14 - firework things so let me go back to
15:17 - this firework object and this particle
15:20 - it needs the last argument of
15:22 - true these particles um it needs the
15:26 - last argument as false but in JavaScript
15:28 - if I don't I could also just pass
15:29 - nothing in and that variable will have
15:31 - the value of undefined which will
15:33 - evaluate to false so this should now if
15:35 - I refresh
15:36 - this we can see that I'm getting
15:39 - something closer so now why are they why
15:42 - are they exploding in this perfect
15:44 - circle well the reason why they're
15:46 - exploding in A Perfect Circle oops I
15:48 - have some
15:49 - old notes from a computer vision
15:52 - tutorial is I'm giving them a random
15:55 - velocity
15:59 - which is a unit Vector all of length one
16:02 - so they're all going to explode out in a
16:04 - perfect circle so one thing I might do
16:06 - is just have those the lengths of those
16:08 - vectors be a slightly random length but
16:11 - and I'm not going to do this in this
16:12 - tutorial but you should make heart
16:15 - fireworks for example so what if you
16:17 - could figure
16:18 - out U if I draw a heart like this from
16:21 - the
16:22 - center vectors pointing out to the edges
16:25 - of a heart so you could actually or you
16:27 - could use you got a fireworks at this
16:28 - display letters or particular kinds of
16:30 - shapes so the way that you pick those
16:32 - initial velocities of that explosion can
16:34 - really make hearts or rainbows or
16:36 - unicorns or whatever kind of shapes you
16:38 - can imagine that you might like to make
16:39 - so I encourage you to do that as a kind
16:40 - of Riff Off of this you can also notice
16:42 - that right now it's running really
16:44 - really slow so that's another thing
16:45 - we're going to have to fix but let me
16:47 - just go back to here and I am going to
16:51 - um uh where was I under particle now the
16:54 - other thing I want to do um is I
16:57 - actually want to to in the particle
17:00 - object I think I want to keep track of
17:04 - this this whether it's the original
17:07 - firework or the particle because I want
17:08 - to like do other things that are
17:10 - different so I'm going to say
17:14 - this um because I also want oh you know
17:17 - what I'm but I'm I'm going to leave that
17:19 - for later okay so let me fix this and
17:21 - say um random 2D and then this do
17:23 - velocity
17:24 - multiply by something
17:27 - like I'll I know what I'm going to do in
17:29 - a second multiply by between um you know
17:33 - uh uh two uh one and six so now it's a
17:38 - magnitude is going to be scaled by some
17:41 - random amount let me run this
17:43 - again oh okay that didn't
17:46 - work what did I not do right let me look
17:48 - at this this velocity multiply oh random
17:53 - a random value between one and six
17:59 - okay so you can see now they're really
18:01 - exploding kind of like wildly there's
18:03 - also too many of them so I can't really
18:05 - see what's going on that well so I'm
18:06 - going to go back to the sketch and make
18:08 - them like quite a bit less
18:11 - often lost power but I'm back now and
18:14 - where I just was is I was saying if this
18:17 - is not one of the seed fireworks
18:21 - particles if it's not one of the seed
18:23 - firework particles let's take its
18:25 - velocity and multiply it by something
18:28 - like .85 so that it slows down um slows
18:33 - down every uh frame and you can see that
18:35 - kind of gives it this sort of like burst
18:37 - out that sort of slows down and stops
18:39 - now there's sort of a funny thing
18:40 - happening where they're still there and
18:42 - when you see a firework it explodes and
18:43 - kind of like Fades out and you know I'm
18:45 - not going to get too crazy with visual
18:47 - dressing here you can make stuff Sparkle
18:49 - and have trails and glow and all sorts
18:51 - of stuff like that but at leasts leasts
18:53 - add something where the fireworks Fade
18:55 - Out so what I want to add is a variable
18:58 - oh I already did because that's before
19:00 - the power ran out I'm going to add a
19:02 - variable called this. lifespan equals
19:05 - 255 and what I'm going to do is in the
19:08 - update function I'm going to say as long
19:10 - also if it's not one of the seed ones I
19:13 - want that lifespan to uh go down by one
19:18 - and this maybe I want it to go down
19:19 - let's actually have it go down by four
19:21 - each frame and what I want is for the
19:24 - particle to uh have a stroke which is is
19:29 - its lifespan so uh so I want to give it
19:31 - some Alpha so I'm going to say if it's
19:34 - not the uh the sort of seed firework do
19:38 - that to the stroke
19:41 - otherwise uh just have a regular stroke
19:44 - and then also let's make them stroke
19:47 - weight two and we'll make the uh those a
19:50 - little bit thicker so let's see what
19:51 - this looks like
19:53 - now is it running really slow no oh
19:56 - lifespan is not defined because because
19:59 - I need to say this do lifespan let's try
20:01 - that
20:02 - again so you can see here now this is a
20:05 - little bit better now you know I should
20:09 - fiddle with these values like maybe this
20:12 - should be uh you know
20:14 - 0.9 and its initial values should
20:17 - actually be between like two and 10 and
20:21 - whoops uh and over here we could see
20:23 - what that looks like now and whether
20:25 - this is better or worse I don't know but
20:28 - I'm going to let you sort of like
20:29 - consider that on your own but I now have
20:31 - the basic idea you can see very quickly
20:34 - now though it's starting to run rather
20:36 - slow so we're losing a lot of frame rate
20:38 - here why are we losing a lot of frame
20:40 - rate well it doesn't matter whether the
20:41 - particles have faded out or left the
20:43 - screen I'm never I'm never getting rid
20:47 - of them so there's a bunch of things I
20:49 - need to do number one I need to say I
20:52 - need to figure out a way of getting rid
20:53 - of particles so here in this um in the
20:57 - fireworks system what I need to do as
20:59 - I'm looping through all the particles
21:01 - first of all I actually want to Loop
21:02 - through the list backwards because I'm
21:03 - going to do something where I'm start
21:04 - plucking them out of the list and if the
21:06 - list is shrinking it's Contracting from
21:08 - the end it works better if I'm going
21:10 - through it backwards and taking things
21:12 - off the the the back end so what I'm
21:14 - going to do is I'm going to change this
21:15 - Loop to say go from particles. length
21:18 - minus one and greater than or equal to Z
21:23 - and iusus let's make sure that still
21:26 - works so nothing's changed it's still
21:29 - working and what I need to do ah go away
21:32 - finder what I need to do now is say okay
21:35 - well if this
21:38 - particle's index I is done then this
21:44 - particles uh splice I so splice is a
21:48 - JavaScript function that deletes
21:50 - something from an array and you can
21:51 - actually splice at I a bunch of things
21:53 - after it but I just want that one
21:54 - particle so if the particle is done
21:56 - splice well how do I know if it's done I
21:58 - need to write a function that says if
22:00 - it's done so in particle. JS I've got
22:02 - another function I need to add I'll just
22:04 - add it over here this DOD and what I'll
22:07 - do is I'll say
22:08 - if if this do
22:12 - lifespan uh is less than zero then
22:15 - return true so that lifespan which is
22:18 - counting down else return false so let's
22:23 - run this it's hard to oops we have an
22:25 - error particle. JS line 30 uh line 30
22:29 - here this DOD equals
22:32 - function so now I have no way of knowing
22:35 - if it's actually removing the particles
22:37 - it does seem to be like performing a bit
22:39 - better like not slowing down so those
22:41 - particles are being deleted but they're
22:42 - actually still a firework object the
22:45 - system object in that list so what I
22:47 - want to do now is add over in the
22:50 - firework object also a function that
22:53 - says this
22:55 - Doone and how do I know if that thing is
22:58 - done well it is done if that particle is
23:01 - exploded and this firework do sorry this
23:05 - do
23:07 - particles. length equals
23:11 - zero right the particle system itself is
23:14 - done as long as it's in a state of
23:16 - having exploded and there are no and all
23:18 - those particles have faded out so if
23:20 - that's the case I should be able to say
23:22 - return true otherwise return uh false so
23:26 - now I can go back to the sketch
23:29 - here and what can I do here in this
23:31 - sketch I also want to Loop through this
23:33 - thing backwards fireworks. length minus
23:36 - one I is greater than or equal to zero
23:40 - iusus and I want to say if fireworks.
23:44 - length oh sorry fireworks. dun ah
23:48 - fireworks indexi
23:50 - DOD then Fire Works in uh splice I comma
23:55 - 1 so now and what I'm going to do is I'm
23:58 - also going to add just to make sure this
24:00 - is all working I'm going to add
24:03 - console.log
24:05 - fireworks. length so now we should be
24:08 - able to
24:10 - see you know as a you can see that that
24:13 - length is going down so it's never going
24:15 - to be too many things on the screen so
24:18 - performance-wise it's going to work fine
24:21 - so this now is and you know JavaScript
24:23 - canvas drawing can be a little bit slow
24:25 - but you can see I've got kind of you
24:27 - know with 100 particles per system it's
24:29 - kind of running reasonably well now we
24:30 - can make this look a little bit nicer uh
24:33 - for example I could um add oops I could
24:37 - add a little bit of alpha to the
24:38 - background meaning have the background
24:40 - um transition in to and we'll have each
24:43 - firework draw a little bit of Trail
24:46 - let's see how this looks right that has
24:48 - a little bit more firework like quality
24:49 - to it that's nice then of
24:52 - course I could say well let me give it a
24:55 - color
24:56 - mode of HS
24:59 - B and I could say for each firework
25:03 - let's for each firework system is going
25:04 - to get its own
25:06 - color uh so uh it should get a hue value
25:11 - is a random
25:12 - Hue and then oh every time I make a
25:18 - particle I'm going to also want so the
25:20 - system gets a hue and then I'm going to
25:22 - want to send that
25:25 - Hue into um let's do that before the
25:28 - last argument here into the particle
25:31 - object so they can use it as
25:33 - well uh so I anytime I make a new
25:36 - particle even in the explode function I
25:38 - also make new particles so I'm going to
25:40 - say this. Hue and
25:44 - false and then now in the particle
25:46 - object I can add a variable to get that
25:51 - Hue value and then I can
25:55 - say uh stroke is the Hue 255
26:01 - 255 Hue 255
26:05 - 255 uh with uh with no Alpha and now
26:09 - when you run this we can see we have now
26:12 - we have rainbow oh how come I lost the
26:14 - trail that's weird what did I do to lose
26:17 - the trail oh you know why I lost the
26:19 - trail is because I changed it to huse
26:21 - the color mode to
26:23 - HSB and the background is now doing
26:26 - something weird so this should fix that
26:29 - I think whoops
26:33 - ah look at that I wonder if this is a
26:35 - bug in P5 GS that we've just found well
26:38 - I'm going to do something here which
26:40 - might make things run a quite a bit slow
26:42 - but I'm going to just change the color
26:43 - mode to RGB here and in each particle
26:46 - right before the particle is drawn I'm
26:48 - going to change the color mode to HSB
26:51 - let's see if that
26:53 - works there we go so uh that should be I
26:57 - think that seems like a bug to me like
26:59 - there should be a way to have an alpha
27:00 - with HSB color mode but now we've got it
27:02 - working um and you can see there we go
27:05 - so there could be a lot of finesse here
27:06 - right I could have those velocities go
27:08 - at an angle I could think more
27:10 - thoughtfully about what the velocities
27:12 - of the bursting particles are I could
27:14 - have uh a variable amount of particles
27:17 - um I could think more thoughtfully about
27:19 - the design I could actually store a list
27:21 - of history of the positions to draw a
27:23 - trail myself I could use like textures I
27:25 - could use something called additive
27:26 - blending maybe I'll um to make things
27:28 - appear more glow like but um but you can
27:32 - see here here's the basic idea so I
27:34 - encourage you to take my JavaScript code
27:36 - and make some improvements on it and I
27:38 - want to make a 3D webg version of this
27:41 - but before I'm ready to do that I'm this
27:44 - is this kind of concludes this video but
27:45 - I'm just going to keep going I'm GNA go
27:48 - back to my processing one I'm going to
27:50 - close this I'm going to go back to my
27:52 - processing sketch which is basically ex
27:56 - 100% EXA the same code that I just
28:00 - wrote but it is oh it's doing it full
28:02 - screen I forgot that it's doing it so
28:04 - one of the things about using Java in a
28:05 - desktop environment is I can kind of get
28:07 - a bit more speed out of it so I have now
28:09 - this full screen application but this is
28:11 - still 2D so what I want to do with this
28:13 - one and let's um let's take off the full
28:15 - screen for a second just so I can kind
28:17 - of see it a bit more clearly let's make
28:19 - it 800 by
28:21 - 600 what I'm going to do here is I'm
28:24 - going to change this to P 3D
28:29 - each particle when it gets drawn is a
28:32 - point but I'm going to say um push
28:36 - Matrix I'm gonna I need to do three
28:39 - actually I could just use I'm going to
28:41 - do do this anyway I'm gonna use
28:46 - translate to add that Z axis and I'm
28:49 - going to say uh point at 0
28:52 - 0 so let's just make sure this still
28:57 - runs oops they're all shooting off above
29:00 - the screen because when I made it
29:02 - smaller the initial
29:04 - velocity uh should uh be less strong so
29:10 - let me just run this again I'll fix that
29:12 - again later okay so that's still working
29:15 - now what I want to do though however is
29:19 - these particles when it explodes
29:22 - somewhere somewhere I create that Vector
29:25 - the random Vector probably in particle
29:26 - system that firework object
29:29 - uh and uh yes and then it makes a new
29:34 - right here it makes a new random 2D
29:37 - Vector I want this to be Random 3D let's
29:41 - look at that let's see if this
29:44 - works now can you see anything different
29:47 - here I'm not so sure you can but
29:50 - technically speaking it should be a
29:51 - random 3D Vector let's see if we can now
29:54 - actually start to rotate the scene to
29:56 - see if this really works so I'm going to
30:00 - add uh I'm going to import a library
30:04 - called pcam which I all which I've been
30:06 - doing which uh I can s say I can add a
30:10 - PC cam
30:12 - object and I can say a cam equals new
30:15 - pyam this and I'm going to say 500 like
30:18 - I want to look at it from 500 pixels
30:19 - away the other thing that I need to do
30:21 - is when I make the initial particles um
30:25 - their
30:26 - location uh sorry when I make that
30:28 - initial particle its location should be
30:31 - random uh py cam makes everything
30:33 - relative to the center 0 Z so I want to
30:36 - look for random negative width divided
30:38 - two to width divided by two and then I
30:40 - also want to change the bottom of the
30:43 - screen is now height divided by two so
30:46 - let's run this and see what
30:50 - happens
30:52 - ooh o py cam oh okay hold on py cam is
30:57 - very unhappy with with my oh clearing of
30:59 - the background
31:01 - technique so I'm going to lose the
31:04 - trails I can get those back in another
31:07 - way and just say background zero I
31:09 - forgot about that once I have peasy cam
31:12 - okay now let's start manipulating the
31:16 - scene can you see I'm looking at it from
31:18 - above
31:20 - now yeah so you can see I need to make a
31:23 - lot more of these to be able to see this
31:25 - more easily let's add let's have a lot
31:28 - more being
31:29 - added um and let's also make the stroke
31:32 - weight of these particles uh much
31:36 - bigger and let's have their lifespan
31:39 - last a little bit
31:41 - longer
31:43 - um and let's run
31:47 - this and okay so now and let's actually
31:50 - just make this full screen again because
31:52 - that might help uh so I want to also
31:55 - make the initial random velocity much
31:57 - bigger
31:59 - and I'm going to go back and make this
32:01 - full
32:04 - screen uh in p3d and let's see if we get
32:07 - some nice 3D fireworks here oh that I
32:10 - can kind of like yeah you can see there
32:13 - they are oh no no no oh yeah they are 3D
32:16 - but they're all like in one plane so I
32:19 - should also probably mess with where
32:22 - they
32:23 - start okay so let's mess with where they
32:25 - start so this starting
32:28 - is uh oh it happens here which is a
32:32 - particle and I don't give it a z
32:33 - location it's Z new particle a random uh
32:38 - okay hold on the new particle gets a
32:41 - random XY and a z and it should have
32:45 - that X Y and
32:47 - Z and so let's give it a z random and
32:50 - then let's give it a random Z which is
32:53 - going to be sometime somewhere between
32:55 - 300 and 300
32:58 - and so I'm going to run
33:00 - this okay now let's sort of zoom out and
33:05 - look there we go so we can see H that's
33:08 - not so there is some zdepth there it's
33:10 - not very much let's make that more
33:17 - extreme I'm pretty sure did I get it we
33:19 - should know now yeah okay now you can
33:23 - see I've got 3D
33:26 - fireworks so and then can see that I
33:28 - could probably do something where I have
33:29 - them burst out quite a bit more and I
33:31 - now have upside down so anyway you get
33:34 - the idea you can play with this more so
33:36 - I encourage you I'm going to post in the
33:39 - description of this video the processing
33:42 - code I'm going to clean this up a little
33:43 - bit the processing code for the 3D
33:45 - fireworks as well as the browser
33:47 - JavaScript code uh I need to get rid of
33:50 - the full screen thing is has to stop
33:53 - stop as well as the um
33:58 - I lost I lost everything ah come on no
34:01 - come
34:02 - back uh fireworks fireworks fireworks
34:05 - somebody see it fireworks P5 as well as
34:07 - the this code the JavaScript version of
34:09 - the 2D fireworks and I hope that you
34:11 - will make pretty shapes out of them I
34:13 - hope that you will add angles I hope
34:14 - that you will think of different ways of
34:16 - doing this and come up with a creative
34:18 - take on this and post it share it with
34:20 - me in the comments or on Twitter or
34:22 - whatever wherever you find on the
34:23 - internet to share it and I hope you
34:24 - enjoyed this quick coding challenge
34:26 - wasn't very quick probably uh of of how
34:30 - to program a fireworks simulation from
34:32 - scratch thanks for watching
