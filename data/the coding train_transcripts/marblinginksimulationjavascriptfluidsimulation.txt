00:00 - today I am going to tackle a p5js
00:03 - simulation of the artistic process known
00:06 - as paper marbling I'm going to consider
00:09 - my P5 JZ canvas as a tray of water then
00:14 - am going to drop a circular blob of ink
00:18 - into that water if I were to pour
00:21 - another drop of ink over here one will
00:24 - push the other one out of the way my
00:27 - challenge to you is how much you think
00:30 - about choosing a color palette for your
00:33 - drops of ink how might you place the
00:36 - drops of ink in a regular or geometric
00:38 - pattern as well as apply the Tim lines
00:42 - in a particular pattern you might even
00:44 - then move Beyond abstract geometry and
00:47 - apply this technique to photographic
00:49 - images or realtime video If you make
00:52 - something based on this mathematical
00:54 - marbling coating challenge share it with
00:55 - me in the passenger showcase thanks for
00:57 - watching this coating Challenge and see
00:59 - you next time
