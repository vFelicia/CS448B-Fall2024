00:00 - hello in case you are following these
00:02 - videos as if you're taking a weekly
00:03 - course here's an assignment that you can
00:05 - do so one thing is the coding challenge
00:07 - that I just did in a way I think that's
00:09 - your assignment come up with a creative
00:11 - way to interact with individual words in
00:15 - a larger body of text and think about
00:17 - how you might use regular expressions
00:19 - with us so how do you match what do you
00:21 - what are you looking for what are you
00:22 - matching how are you replacing that sort
00:24 - of thing the other thing though you
00:25 - might really do is if you did the
00:26 - previous assignment about sort of text
00:28 - mashup without regular expressions or
00:31 - you simply did it manually your
00:32 - assignment would be to do that now with
00:34 - programming with algorithms with regular
00:36 - expressions I also have a few ideas here
00:39 - that I've written up are things you
00:41 - might think about you know the flesh
00:44 - index calculator I made as an example I
00:46 - didn't use regular expressions for it if
00:48 - you rewrote it with regular expressions
00:50 - that would certainly make it probably
00:51 - more efficient or be a good exercise and
00:53 - using regular expressions I'm thinking
00:56 - about how you could translate a text
00:57 - using the replace method the pirate
01:00 - translator which takes hello my name is
01:02 - Dan and turns it to do a hoary matey
01:05 - dan my name is you could think about
01:09 - using as using a regular expression to
01:12 - do that and also you might simply look
01:14 - around making a game that you play with
01:16 - regular expressions so the regex golf
01:18 - game is something you can actually play
01:20 - there's a regex crossword game that it's
01:22 - not linked here but you up try to add to
01:24 - the to this page that will be linked in
01:26 - the description of this video and yeah
01:29 - so you could do something like that it
01:31 - may be write up a blog post or something
01:32 - about you know how it was working with
01:34 - write of expressions what worked for you
01:36 - what didn't work for you what questions
01:37 - you have and I'll review those questions
01:39 - and things and reactions to regular
01:41 - expressions in next week's live stream
01:44 - where I also look at data okay so enjoy
01:46 - I hope some of you do this assignment
01:47 - you can share it with me in the slack if
01:49 - you subscribed as a patron or you can
01:51 - simply just tweet at me or share it in
01:52 - the comments here okay thanks for
01:54 - watching and see you soon
