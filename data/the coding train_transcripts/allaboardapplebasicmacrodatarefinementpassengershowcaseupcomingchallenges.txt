02:43 - foreign
02:46 - [Music]
02:56 - [Music]
03:07 - so
03:26 - hello i am testing my microphone i'm
03:29 - going to get started in just a few
03:31 - minutes let me come over here and say hi
03:33 - i don't know how the balance is between
03:35 - my
03:36 - mic that i'm wearing here
03:38 - as well as um
03:40 - the music that's playing but the music
03:42 - is going to go off soon
03:43 - this is a new i'm in a new studio that's
03:45 - the same studio just did some
03:47 - renovations in here i streamed on twitch
03:49 - earlier this week so some of you might
03:51 - have caught that
03:52 - if you didn't though this is the first
03:54 - uh youtube stream
03:56 - i've got a little setup here that i'm
03:58 - gonna work on today we'll see how it
04:00 - goes but i'll talk about that in a
04:01 - minute i'm still getting set up let me
04:02 - just come over here
04:07 - oh
04:10 - [Music]
04:21 - do
04:35 - do
04:56 - [Music]
05:01 - all right hello everyone uh welcome
05:04 - to a uh coding train live stream ah
05:07 - where is
05:08 - i have all new equipment and new things
05:10 - oh and i forgot to even turn this light
05:12 - on
05:14 - uh
05:14 - i'm using some new
05:16 - fancy uh
05:18 - echo reduction and noise suppression
05:21 - technology
05:23 - which is hopefully making my audio come
05:25 - in loud and clear to you i see some
05:27 - familiar names in the chat of people
05:29 - that i know either in person or online
05:32 - or through the internet and it's just
05:34 - delightful and wonderful to see all of
05:36 - you it makes me so happy i think this is
05:38 - the button i press
05:40 - to fade out that sound so this is a bit
05:42 - of an unusual stream uh mostly to do
05:44 - with this setup that i have over here
05:47 - which is uh i was saying in the coding
05:49 - train discord earlier that it might turn
05:52 - into a sort of like al capone's vault
05:55 - reveal because i have my childhood
05:57 - computer boxed up in boxes around this
06:00 - room uh 19 i don't actually don't know
06:03 - the exact year probably 1982
06:05 - apple ii plus computer i'm going to
06:07 - attempt to plug all the pieces together
06:10 - and turn it on
06:12 - i have other things i could do if that
06:13 - totally doesn't work but that's my plan
06:16 - for today uh if you are a new viewer uh
06:20 - welcome this is the coding train it is
06:22 - uh what i would like to say is a regular
06:25 - weekly live stream on a youtube thing
06:28 - where there are also uh many different
06:31 - sequenced video tutorials that you could
06:32 - follow along if you've never coded
06:34 - before and would like to learn to code
06:36 - there are also some project videos
06:38 - called coding challenges that are kind
06:40 - of standalone
06:41 - projects that you could follow along and
06:43 - maybe make a creative project be
06:44 - inspired to make a creative project from
06:46 - most of those probably re no i don't say
06:49 - require but uh if you've never coded
06:51 - before you'll want to watch the start
06:53 - learning here i should show you all this
06:54 - because i have a whole computer and
06:56 - everything but anyway i'm just talking
06:58 - how are you all doing
07:00 - how was your friday
07:02 - there was a big storm last night i'm in
07:04 - the hudson valley up uh now i don't know
07:06 - if it really counts as upstate but uh in
07:08 - between new york city and the top of new
07:09 - york state is where i am uh it was a
07:12 - huge storm last night uh trees were
07:16 - flailing and branches were flying the
07:18 - power went off the power went on so i
07:20 - was wondering if the internet and the
07:21 - power would comply today
07:24 - um
07:25 - but it seems like it is i feel like
07:26 - there are important announcements and
07:28 - things i should talk about but i kind of
07:30 - just want to get started
07:33 - um
07:35 - and let me just take i'm just going to
07:36 - take a quick peek at the chat to see if
07:38 - there's any important questions
07:40 - is this the garage yes so i have i'm in
07:44 - a garage
07:45 - it's wonderful to have a space that i
07:47 - i've never had my own space like this
07:49 - before we'll see uh
07:51 - how long it lasts
07:53 - but it's been pretty great
07:55 - um
07:56 - yeah i could talk forever about that but
07:58 - that's where i am i'm going to hopefully
07:59 - do a little bit of a
08:01 - um
08:02 - studio tour kind of video or
08:04 - documentation at some point it's been a
08:05 - while since i've done one of those
08:07 - uh ten print high yeah um
08:12 - uh um let's look at it fasten your seat
08:15 - belt yeah
08:16 - um i uh anand says i fall in love with
08:19 - coding six months ago
08:22 - um
08:23 - it's never too late
08:24 - you know i i mean i didn't start coding
08:27 - well
08:29 - this is good this is appropriate for me
08:30 - to talk about actually so i'm going to
08:32 - come over here
08:33 - uh first of all before i before i start
08:35 - working on the computer i want to show
08:37 - you something i showed this on my twitch
08:39 - stream earlier this week but i have to
08:40 - bring it up again this is uh um
08:44 - a 1964 copy of scientific american uh i
08:48 - did a video coding challenge about this
08:51 - particular prime number pattern often
08:53 - referred to as the prime spiral or the
08:55 - ulam spiral
08:56 - i did not have this magazine but the
08:59 - original when i did the video but i went
09:01 - and ordered it did you know you can
09:02 - order basically any scientific american
09:04 - magazine from the past
09:06 - just just deliver it right to your door
09:08 - i think it was like 20 bucks i mean
09:10 - that's my hard-earned coding train
09:14 - adsense money there this is where it's
09:16 - going to people
09:17 - um
09:18 - i mean it's you know
09:20 - we'll talk
09:21 - yeah so many things to talk about let me
09:23 - find this though because
09:24 - um the article i also want to get the
09:27 - one that martin gardner who is an author
09:29 - uh who wrote many different articles
09:31 - about different mathematical
09:33 - uh things um
09:35 - here is the page uh about the cover and
09:38 - then it's going to say page 122. so i
09:41 - want to find the article i really should
09:42 - have i should get my overhead camera set
09:44 - up so i could show you this more
09:47 - um
09:48 - specifically but here uh with a sort of
09:51 - better actually you know what i think if
09:52 - i come over here
09:54 - strangely enough
09:55 - uh whoops wrong button i think this will
09:58 - actually be a better view
09:59 - of this i'm so look over here and see oh
10:01 - it's way too bright but um you can see
10:04 - um the uh article about mathematical
10:07 - games the remarkable lore of prime
10:09 - numbers i'll just read a little bit of
10:10 - this to you
10:11 - from scientific americans 1964 issue
10:15 - march
10:17 - 60 cents for this thing i mean boy
10:20 - that's appreciated well i think i spent
10:22 - 20 bucks on this
10:23 - uh the remarkable lore of prime numbers
10:25 - by martin gardner no branch of number
10:28 - theory is more saturated with mystery
10:29 - and elegance than the study of prime
10:31 - numbers those exasperating unruly
10:34 - integers that refuse to be divided
10:36 - evenly by any integers except themselves
10:39 - and one
10:40 - some problems concerning primes are so
10:41 - simple that a child could understand
10:43 - them and yet so deep and far from solved
10:45 - that many mathematicians now suspect
10:47 - they have no solution perhaps they're
10:50 - undecidable perhaps number theory like
10:52 - quantum mechanics has its own
10:53 - uncertainty principle that makes it
10:55 - necessary in certain areas to abandon
10:57 - exactness for probabilistic formulations
10:59 - okay i could read this all day the other
11:00 - thing that's really amazing about this
11:02 - are the ads uh let's see i think if i i
11:06 - i
11:07 - clearly this is a new setup for me so i
11:09 - haven't really worked this out
11:10 - but um we can come over here and see
11:12 - let's see ah there we go look at these
11:14 - ads uh the remarkable um digital
11:17 - guidance computers use titan ii and
11:18 - titan three nasa saturn one from ibm
11:21 - here two more from hoffman's complete
11:23 - line
11:24 - of cryogenic equipment did you know that
11:26 - the coding train is sponsored by hoffman
11:28 - laboratories inc
11:29 - the complete line of cryogenic equipment
11:32 - no lost transfer hoses flexible sturdy
11:34 - made of high-strength bronze transfers
11:36 - liquid oxygen nitrogen okay okay you get
11:39 - the idea um all right so i wanted to
11:42 - show that to you um i'm still in the
11:44 - market if anybody can find one on the
11:46 - internet this will cost quite a bit more
11:48 - of my hard-earned uh coding trained
11:50 - funds uh this is a reprint of my
11:52 - favorite book a million random digits
11:54 - with a hundred thousand normal dv it's
11:55 - from the rand corporation anybody out
11:57 - there watching knows where you can i can
11:59 - find an original print please let me
12:00 - know
12:01 - um
12:03 - all right uh hello uh
12:05 - chat folks okay um so let's get this
12:08 - going let's just start because
12:10 - i don't know how this is going to go i
12:11 - don't have a huge amount of time all
12:13 - right
12:15 - so uh somebody in the chat and i've
12:16 - already forgotten had mentioned oh you
12:19 - know i'm just starting to learn to code
12:21 - now
12:22 - is it too late for me or um so first of
12:24 - all i didn't begin
12:25 - uh programming
12:27 - in earnest i would say until i was about
12:30 - 28 or 29 i can't remember the exact date
12:32 - somewhere around there learned to code
12:35 - with
12:36 - macromedia director uh not to be
12:38 - confirmed with uh confused with uh macro
12:40 - data refinement which is another topic
12:42 - we'll see if we get to today
12:44 - uh those of you who know you know
12:46 - um
12:47 - and look at this beautiful rainbow apple
12:50 - by the way can you see that oh
12:54 - i know i'm distracted easily
12:56 - that looks kind of heavy
12:58 - i'm sorry i have the focus but look at
13:00 - that rainbow apple logo come on get get
13:03 - with the program people bring that back
13:05 - um
13:06 - so um i didn't really program until um
13:11 - then and i learned with macro media
13:12 - director i found processing i've sort of
13:14 - talked about this before many a time
13:16 - probably but when i was younger i was
13:19 - into the computer
13:21 - this was actually this computer had my
13:24 - i suppose this button was turned on and
13:26 - off by my probably 10 year old self
13:28 - um my family purchased it i'm guessing i
13:31 - couldn't tell you 1982 would be a good
13:34 - guess i was born in 1973.
13:36 - um
13:38 - and so i did a little bit of basic
13:39 - programming on it in elementary school
13:41 - it wasn't a thing that i spent a lot of
13:42 - time and i sort of did it and then moved
13:44 - on to other things i remember
13:45 - specifically playing a game called
13:48 - monaco gp which i had to load from a
13:51 - tape
13:52 - which i believe there's a box that i
13:54 - have yet to even open so i'm unboxing i
13:57 - my parents i went to visit them i got
13:59 - all the stuff from the attic i brought
14:00 - it here uh just put the monitor here
14:02 - because it's the nicest looking uh piece
14:05 - one of the things that i wanted to show
14:07 - which is really amazing
14:08 - is
14:10 - you know i have some very meticulously
14:12 - organized parents because this is the
14:14 - original box that came in
14:19 - the record of sale
14:21 - like
14:22 - shipping label thing is still encased in
14:25 - the plastic here
14:27 - record of sale
14:28 - award or lease of monochrome monitor
14:31 - as required by federal regulation 21 cfr
14:35 - subchapter j this is model number
14:37 - a3m0039
14:40 - this card must be filled in duplicate by
14:42 - transformer at the time of sale to final
14:44 - consumer
14:46 - so this is this label here it looks like
14:47 - it was shipped to
14:49 - balanced computer and i realized the
14:51 - focus is not i should probably put on
14:53 - the autofocus
14:55 - balance computer corporation balanced
14:57 - computer center 109 beaver court
14:59 - cockeysville maryland that can only
15:01 - assume that's where this was purchased
15:04 - um
15:05 - and this is the original box look at
15:07 - that
15:09 - all right now for some other equipment
15:10 - that's not in the original box
15:13 - let's go actually there is some
15:14 - equipment that is in the original box
15:16 - but i will i will get to that i have to
15:17 - find it okay where is the box with the
15:19 - computer in it don't tell me i've lost
15:21 - it already oh no i found it okay
15:23 - so let's start with this oh and this
15:26 - table
15:27 - i'm a little bit worried that this table
15:29 - is not big enough i have another table
15:30 - over there um but here we go
15:32 - unfortunately i also can't really see
15:34 - the chat right now you know what i'm
15:35 - gonna do
15:37 - i'm gonna bring this um
15:40 - ipad i have here
15:43 - um
15:45 - and
15:47 - all right so let me just let me just
15:49 - address the severance references because
15:50 - i see that shy 100 so first of all
15:52 - please nobody spoil this wonderful
15:54 - television program
15:56 - for other folks but um
15:59 - i've been kind of really just sort of
16:00 - into recently retro technology i've got
16:03 - a whole bunch of other old computers
16:04 - over there i'll show you a fun one that
16:06 - i just bought off of ebay
16:08 - not too long ago um
16:11 - quite a bit more modern than that one
16:12 - this is uh
16:15 - this is i don't know at one point this
16:16 - was a property of auburn university at
16:19 - montgomery but this is a one of those
16:21 - old apple clam shell computers but um
16:24 - uh this the severance tv show which is a
16:27 - show that i've been really enjoying i
16:28 - was on a podcast you can check that out
16:29 - i'll put a link to it and stuff like
16:31 - that about it um
16:34 - it's uh
16:35 - they use all these um older props which
16:38 - i um
16:39 - are i think data general computers i can
16:41 - pull it up on my laptop later to show
16:43 - you um which are dumb terminals um
16:45 - they're not dumb terminals it's kind of
16:47 - i don't i don't love that name for it
16:49 - calling it a dumb terminal but dumb
16:51 - terminals were
16:53 - you know monochrome usually monochrome
16:54 - monitors terminals that didn't have that
16:57 - hooked up to you know before everybody
16:58 - had their own personal computer you had
17:00 - to hook your terminal up to a mainframe
17:02 - so that multiple people could do access
17:04 - that computing power all at once anyway
17:07 - i want to get one of those but all right
17:10 - so uh let's see here um i've got the box
17:13 - here everything is kind of like attached
17:15 - so
17:16 - it's a little bit here's the actual
17:20 - it's falling apart okay
17:22 - you know what um let me just get this
17:24 - other table
17:25 - it's going to make life easier
17:27 - bear with me people
17:28 - um i should have set this up
17:31 - i know you can't see me i have another
17:33 - table here oh you know what i have a
17:34 - folding table let me just grab this
17:36 - folding card table this will be easier
17:39 - there's a toaster let's see
17:43 - this is the very professional uh outfit
17:45 - i'm running here
17:48 - okay
17:50 - all right
17:51 - so
17:52 - it's gonna fit through the door
17:54 - yeah i think so okay
17:56 - all right so i'm bringing another table
17:58 - in here because you need some more room
18:01 - let's put the box on it
18:03 - i will point the camera at it don't you
18:05 - worry
18:12 - oh my god there's a a nickel inside the
18:15 - computer that's not a good sign okay
18:17 - all right so the computer's in here
18:20 - let's try to
18:22 - very very carefully
18:24 - lift it out
18:26 - now it's got a bunch of things attached
18:29 - so i'm going to bring all these things
18:31 - with it
18:32 - this is how it was stored
18:35 - some disk drives
18:37 - and a joystick oh my god
18:43 - okay let's put it over here
18:47 - get rid of the box
18:51 - maybe i'll switch the camera to
18:52 - autofocus and let's put it on this table
18:55 - to the left here so i can have some more
18:58 - space
19:00 - i'm probably going to need a chair
19:04 - and i was meaning to look at the chat
19:06 - which i can kind of see
19:08 - here
19:14 - okay so uh uh i'm gonna come later today
19:17 - if there's time i'm gonna show you this
19:19 - macro data refinement program that i've
19:20 - been using i love working on you can
19:22 - find it on my github
19:24 - if you're looking for a wonderful
19:25 - podcast about the show severance uh
19:28 - check out
19:29 - post show recaps severance podcast uh
19:32 - episode 8 feedback was the one that i
19:34 - was a guest on but
19:36 - um yeah so you can check that out for
19:38 - those who are asking um
19:40 - yeah this joystick is wild right look at
19:42 - this
19:43 - um so let me see here
19:46 - now the next box that i need to get we
19:49 - move these precious things out of the
19:51 - way
19:52 - you can see uh
19:54 - i think the ipad is really ruining the
19:56 - vibe here let me put it back over here
19:59 - um
20:01 - okay
20:02 - now i have another box that i'm gonna
20:04 - get
20:08 - which i have yet to look inside
20:11 - i have no idea what's going to be in
20:12 - here
20:16 - this says first of all i love that this
20:17 - is a
20:19 - washington apples
20:21 - to find the world's finest apples
20:24 - let's do something here so you can see
20:26 - more of what i'm doing i'm going to
20:27 - switch to autofocus
20:30 - which i think will hopefully
20:33 - help things here oops
20:41 - everybody relax i know how to operate
20:44 - this equipment
20:47 - loosen there we go okay there we go this
20:50 - should be good
20:51 - um
20:53 - and now let me do
20:55 - uh
20:58 - continuous autofocus so hopefully
21:03 - that's going to
21:05 - help things okay
21:06 - i believe i'm on no it just says manual
21:09 - focus hold on
21:11 - uh focus mode
21:14 - continuous autofocus there we go
21:17 - okay
21:20 - all right everyone
21:22 - uh let me get this light here
21:24 - a little bit better positioned
21:26 - you can't see me i'm gonna get a chair
21:29 - i don't usually i'm not used to sitting
21:31 - in a chair when i'm streaming
21:33 - i have a little stool maybe i should get
21:35 - the uh this is good this is actually uh
21:37 - uh speaking of it's funny how this chair
21:39 - is for my grandmother
21:41 - bella minnell who is one of the fir
21:43 - first women phd in mathematics you can
21:46 - you can look her up
21:47 - uh bella manel if you uh the nature of
21:49 - code book is dedicated to her
21:51 - um
21:53 - this is kind of fun
21:56 - oh okay great all right so uh next up
21:58 - let's move this to the side
22:00 - let's open this box because i i don't i
22:02 - need to need
22:04 - some power cords and things i'm hoping
22:06 - everything is here
22:08 - okay we're gonna find out what's in the

23:17 - now when i bring things closer to the
23:18 - camera you'll be able to see them better
23:20 - assuming the autofocus works it wants to
23:22 - focus on my face so i think if i put
23:24 - this here all right so we found this

28:37 - like film
28:39 - canister
28:40 - that says screw for epson fx 80. so this
28:44 - is a screw
28:45 - save for the printer that i'm gonna like
28:47 - and kept in this little bag
28:50 - um okay i can go through more of this
28:52 - stuff later i really want to get the
28:53 - thing on
28:55 - but i the the thing that i need is i
28:57 - need the power oh no i have the power
28:59 - for the monitor i need to figure out
29:00 - what the video out is so i have the
29:03 - power for the computer

29:50 - they're like little dials
29:52 - are these little like controllers
29:56 - this is good for macro data refining
29:59 - wouldn't you think they use a trackball
30:01 - in severance which isn't something you
30:02 - would have found with a 1977
30:05 - data general d2 computer uh it would
30:08 - have just had a keyboard interface no
30:10 - mouse no trackball for sure
30:13 - um
30:15 - this looks like
30:16 - odd oh video right
30:18 - this has got to be
30:24 - this has got to be the video go this is
30:26 - right is this a video cable
30:29 - this is a video cable
30:31 - it's an analog video cable this is
30:34 - another power cord
30:37 - but i would assume that this is the
30:39 - power cord that goes with it
30:41 - because it's like a whole big box
30:45 - um
30:48 - game paddles like atari 2600 okay
30:51 - uh accounting for inflation says matthew
30:54 - rice the apple ii was around five
30:56 - thousand dollars in today's dollars okay

31:19 - notes on
31:21 - various things
31:22 - related to the computer
31:24 - um which i would love to go through and
31:26 - sort of like learn everything
31:31 - okay um basic programming reference
31:33 - manual we're gonna need this
31:35 - dos manual
31:37 - we've got the epson users manual the
31:40 - apple soft tutorial the apple ii
31:42 - reference manual okay jackpot everybody
31:46 - jackpot

31:51 - oh it's got a 1200 300 baud intelligent
31:54 - modem they can get video term 80 column
31:56 - display okay there's a lot of things in
31:58 - here
31:59 - but i want to get a move on
32:02 - trying to get this thing
32:04 - hooked up this is another like video
32:06 - possibly video cable
32:09 - okay so let's look at the
32:12 - um
32:15 - uh not the apple so i want the apple ii
32:18 - reference manual there we go okay
32:25 - then we're going to need this the apple
32:26 - ii uh reference manual
32:30 - so uh let's
32:33 - let's look at how uh we turn it on the
32:36 - power supply page two
32:38 - approaching your apple chapter one the
32:40 - power supply
32:43 - okay yep main board all right let's take
32:45 - a look here
32:49 - can you see the beauty that's inside
32:51 - this thing
32:53 - main board
32:55 - power supply
32:57 - speaker there is no this oh yeah there's
32:59 - the speaker
33:00 - um so apologies um
33:03 - uh you know i could set up i do have
33:06 - like an overhead camera but
33:08 - let's just see how far i can get just
33:10 - with what the setup i have
33:12 - um
33:13 - the metal box on the left side of the
33:14 - interior is the power supply it supplies
33:16 - four voltages 5 volts negative 5.2 v
33:19 - plus a
33:20 - high frequency okay
33:21 - a photo to the back of okay
33:26 - keyboard talking to your apple your link
33:29 - to your apple is at your fingertips
33:31 - most programs and languages that are
33:33 - used with the apple expect you to talk
33:35 - to them through the apple's keyboard
33:38 - hello
33:39 - hello
33:41 - are you there
33:44 - it looks like a normal typewriter
33:45 - keyboard except for some minor
33:46 - rearrangement and a few special keys
33:49 - for a quick review of the keyboard see
33:51 - pages 6 through 12 in the apple ii basic
33:53 - programming manual
33:54 - since you're talking with your fingers
33:56 - you might as well be hearing with your
33:57 - eyes the apple will tell you what it is
33:59 - doing by displaying letters numbers
34:02 - symbols and sometimes colored blocks and
34:05 - lines on a black and white or color
34:08 - television set
34:10 - but i've got
34:11 - a monitor here
34:13 - let's all right
34:14 - i'm going to unplug these disk drives
34:16 - which are really kind of in my way i
34:18 - think
34:20 - which i believe
34:22 - i can just take these what is this no
34:24 - um so i have these two disk drives
34:29 - drive one drive two
34:32 - um
34:34 - let's leave them plugged in what is
34:36 - going on over here okay
34:37 - let's move stuff i don't need out of the
34:39 - way
34:51 - this joystick is this joystick actually
34:53 - attached right now
34:55 - is that i certainly don't need and that
34:56 - could be a little extra space for me
34:58 - what is this
35:00 - ah this is the video out
35:05 - why is it like this this worries me
35:08 - but i'm assuming this is video out
35:12 - but it is oh but there also is there why
35:15 - is this just loose
35:17 - well
35:18 - okay
35:19 - so we're gonna start by um
35:25 - put the
35:27 - chat on the floor sorry chat you're on
35:29 - the floor now
35:31 - i'm going to start by
35:33 - let's try to clean this up what is this
35:35 - attached to
35:39 - let's clean all these i'm cleaning all
35:41 - these cables up so that it's not so
35:43 - messy
35:45 - these are quite tangled let's see this
35:47 - is these are extra things
35:50 - move these ah look at this
35:52 - this must be the video out okay
35:56 - why what's this cable
35:59 - this is
36:00 - oh my goodness modem found the modem
36:03 - let's unplug that little telephone cord
36:05 - it's all tied up
36:08 - so i'm just trying to unplug some things
36:10 - i know i don't need right now like
36:12 - i don't think i don't have a landline
36:14 - phone so
36:16 - there's not really a way i can make use
36:18 - of that
36:21 - okay
36:25 - um
36:28 - all right
36:30 - phone cord
36:32 - do not need
36:34 - put this off to the side
36:36 - this drive number one
36:41 - this drive number two i don't like the
36:42 - way these cables are tangled
36:45 - i think this is better now let's try to
36:47 - find where
36:49 - untangle this joystick
36:55 - uh okay
36:57 - untangle this joystick
37:00 - yes i can leave it plugged in
37:02 - no harm no foul the joystick is plugged
37:05 - in i could undo it
37:07 - i just want to understand why there's
37:09 - this extra loose
37:11 - kind of video out
37:14 - but and why this is so
37:20 - don't worry about that okay
37:22 - so now
37:26 - oh i see this has been probably tied up
37:29 - to be stored so if i untie it
37:40 - this is
37:42 - there we go
37:44 - just want to remove this which is in my
37:46 - way
37:47 - this is the joystick
37:51 - which is now not plugged in
37:55 - so that's okay
37:56 - leave that to the side
37:58 - and now this
38:00 - must be the video out
38:02 - cable
38:04 - i hope the chat isn't all yelling at me
38:06 - like you're doing it wrong
38:09 - i'm pretty sure i'm doing it right
38:14 - yeah there we go
38:15 - okay
38:18 - now let's plug in
38:21 - ah this is one of no this is just an
38:23 - extra
38:25 - this must be for the printer this must
38:27 - be for the printer this one i'm guessing
38:29 - so let's put that off to the side all
38:30 - right we're ready for the
38:32 - power supply now
38:35 - so this is going to go in here i'm going
38:36 - to check the chat in a second to make
38:38 - sure there's nobody yelling at me like
38:40 - you're about to set everything on fire
38:43 - um
38:45 - okay
38:46 - uh okay i'm just looking at the chat
38:49 - here
38:50 - thank you
38:51 - uh put this off to the side
38:54 - now
38:56 - now this needs to be i need an extension
38:59 - cord
39:01 - again this is going to be very
39:02 - anticlimactic when i can't get anything
39:05 - to turn on or work but that's okay i'll
39:07 - go off and do something else
39:10 - with my day you will too
39:13 - you will too okay
39:16 - all right this actually has quite a bit
39:18 - of
39:19 - uh
39:20 - slack on it
39:22 - uh that light is plugged in through an
39:24 - extension cord let me find another
39:25 - extension cord
39:29 - okay where where where
39:34 - went to my
39:37 - local
39:39 - hardware store
39:42 - bought
39:42 - a couple these are these are uh 2000
39:45 - circa 2022 era extension cords
39:50 - someday
39:52 - my children will be unpacking a box and
39:54 - be like look at this
39:57 - two-year-old extension core
40:00 - you're like
40:03 - what is this strange macbook pro machine
40:08 - uh all right is this gonna be long
40:09 - enough this is a very short extension
40:11 - cord what was i thinking let's get along
40:14 - is it where's let's get a longer one
40:16 - um i actually have some in a box over
40:18 - here
40:20 - previously
40:21 - here's a really long here this is
40:23 - probably a uh
40:25 - circa i'm guessing 2021
40:28 - era extension cord much longer
40:31 - very dramatic here as i
40:34 - i made such a mess in this room i just i
40:37 - really shouldn't stream i should just
40:38 - spend my whole day cleaning and in fact
40:40 - that's is all i ever want to do is clean
40:43 - clean up organize
40:45 - can i just do that for the rest of my
40:47 - life i'd be so happy
40:49 - all right now we gotta find a place to
40:51 - plug this in
40:52 - where i won't trip over it where is the
40:55 - nearest
40:56 - power outlet
40:59 - uh not over there
41:01 - all right all right this is
41:04 - not the greatest you know what i'm gonna
41:06 - bring it over here
41:09 - okay
41:10 - uh if everything i'm about to plug this
41:12 - in
41:13 - if everything goes off it's because i've
41:16 - short-circuited my entire setup and
41:18 - blown several fuses okay it is plugged
41:20 - in
41:21 - it is now plugged in now
41:24 - i would also like to plug in
41:26 - this monitor
41:28 - that i believe
41:30 - the power cord should be able to
41:32 - reach but
41:34 - that's what a short extension cord is
41:36 - for
41:37 - where did i put that short extension
41:39 - cord people
41:41 - it's somewhere around here i had it in
41:43 - my hands a moment ago i walked over here
41:47 - to find a different extension cord oh
41:49 - there it is
41:51 - okay
41:54 - i'm sorry i don't have like a wide shot
41:56 - or anything i should have
41:58 - thought about this more but
42:00 - it it's kind of an impulse stream
42:02 - decided to do this today so now i'm
42:04 - plugging in the monitor
42:06 - this is going to go
42:09 - into hmm
42:12 - i need a three prong okay wait hold on
42:16 - this should okay
42:17 - the light's gonna go off but i don't
42:19 - think that matters
42:20 - uh now this should be able to go plug in
42:23 - like
42:24 - oh my god seriously
42:27 - there we go ah no don't fall over okay
42:30 - there we go the monitor should be
42:31 - plugged in
42:36 - ready everyone i'm gonna turn this and
42:37 - press this button
42:43 - okay it's on
42:49 - i don't see it i don't see anything
42:50 - happening
42:52 - the computer's not on nor is the
42:53 - computer plugged in
42:55 - okay where's the analog video cable that
42:58 - i found
43:00 - i put it somewhere oh it's over here
43:03 - so let's look at the back of this one
43:04 - probably just maybe it just needs to
43:06 - warm up
43:09 - video in
43:11 - okay this is going into the video in
43:16 - now this there's a lot of things like
43:17 - there's this this must be the video out
43:20 - i'm guessing but there's also this video
43:22 - i'm gonna just try this
43:25 - and what's the chance
43:27 - that this thing actually turns on
43:29 - and something shows up here seems very
43:31 - very unlikely
43:33 - i'm going to take a look at the chat
43:36 - just to see if anyone's got any
43:38 - tips for me or important bits of
43:41 - information
43:44 - um
43:45 - okay tetris would be fun
43:48 - okay
43:50 - uh maybe plug in the signal to see the
43:53 - signal i don't know what that means but
43:54 - that sounds like a very smart suggestion
44:01 - am i blocking your view with this it's
44:03 - terrible terrible
44:05 - um
44:06 - put this down here
44:12 - contrast is all the way up
44:19 - oh hilariously the switch is on
44:22 - i didn't check that so let me turn it
44:24 - off
44:26 - that's weird
44:37 - yeah i have i this is what i was
44:39 - expecting would happen
44:40 - nothing
44:47 - and scene
44:49 - thank you for tuning in to today's
44:51 - coding train live stream i'm going to
44:53 - spend all weekend getting this thing to
44:55 - work i'll probably have to repair it and
44:57 - look up read stuff but let's see let's
44:58 - see if i can get any further just even
45:01 - in today
45:03 - ah
45:05 - it would help for this to be on
45:07 - okay let's turn this off
45:10 - this one ah there we go
45:11 - that's something
45:17 - maybe that's the wrong way
45:18 - oh there we go
45:22 - yeah
45:24 - can you see this power light here i
45:26 - don't know if that makes it through
45:32 - oh my goodness
45:34 - it's on
45:36 - can you see that
45:39 - i have to see i've just checked my
45:41 - monitor here on that yeah you can see
45:42 - that all right
45:44 - this is promising
45:46 - now it said the apple wants me to talk
45:49 - to it through the keyboard
45:51 - computer
45:54 - play minecraft
45:58 - it didn't seem to work
46:03 - well this was at least something
46:04 - happened
46:06 - let's play with this contrast yeah look
46:07 - at that wow turn it all the way up
46:10 - all right what do people think do i need
46:12 - what's in these disk drives
46:15 - one drive two
46:19 - reset
46:24 - whoa something changed there
46:29 - what happens if i turn it off and on
46:30 - again
46:31 - what maybe that'll work turn it off and
46:33 - on again
46:37 - look at the chat here
46:40 - uh
46:45 - uh do you have i think people are
46:47 - suggesting
46:48 - uh various other perhaps youtube uh
46:51 - personalities or technology experts who
46:54 - might actually be able to help me get
46:55 - this thing working
46:57 - um what i see on the screen tells me
46:59 - stuff is powered up but i'm not
47:01 - convinced it's doing anything productive
47:03 - check all the boards are seated push the
47:05 - reset key okay
47:10 - press the reset key
47:13 - let's be more aggressive and turn it off
47:19 - and i am going to have to start to check
47:21 - to see if all the boards are in place
47:24 - and
47:25 - what might be needed
47:30 - oh it's definitely trying to load
47:31 - something from this disk oh apple ii it
47:34 - says apple ii
47:35 - do you see that
47:37 - it says apple ii
47:45 - it's a black screen with apple ii at the
47:46 - top
47:48 - and it tried this disk drive went
47:51 - like it wanted to load a disk from it
47:55 - let's see what disks i have
48:00 - like do i need to load dos
48:05 - oh look at this oh my god
48:07 - people
48:11 - this is not my handwriting this is my
48:13 - handwriting i think
48:16 - i think that's my handwriting
48:18 - what autofocus on it pretty sure that's
48:20 - my handwriting but this is definitely my
48:22 - dad's handwriting here
48:27 - um
48:28 - assembler
48:29 - supertext
48:32 - by the way handle like never forget
48:34 - handle like
48:35 - glass
48:38 - don't keep them comfortable don't jam
48:40 - them into our slots so do i try one of
48:42 - these discs just as apple ii there
48:46 - uh holding down control while pressing
48:48 - and releasing reset then releasing
48:49 - control called doing a control reset
48:51 - will send you into applesoft without
48:53 - having to boot a disk okay
48:56 - holding down control
48:58 - while pressing and releasing
49:01 - um
49:03 - reset okay here we go
49:10 - i have a dos prompt
49:17 - keyboard
49:19 - doesn't seem to be connected
49:25 - but no i did control reset
49:31 - that's interesting i've gotten a dos
49:33 - prompt now
49:37 - um
49:41 - yes my father is still with us ask the
49:43 - chat
49:44 - um
49:48 - so let's see what other
49:50 - discs i have
49:53 - that's not a dos product okay excuse me
49:56 - it's been a little it's been about 40
49:58 - years since i took a look at this
50:02 - these are just blanked as hardball
50:05 - is that a game
50:07 - wave that's my brother's handwriting
50:09 - wavy navy backup what is wavy navy
50:13 - joust side two can you have this is a
50:15 - double-sided disc
50:17 - side one chivalry side two joust
50:22 - oh my god
50:23 - so i really want to get this analog
50:26 - this is going to be the one thing that
50:28 - i'm really thrilled about is this analog
50:30 - video is working so there's no reason
50:31 - why i couldn't get the analog out
50:33 - and pass it you know convert it to hdmi
50:37 - and then pass it into my capture card so
50:39 - i could be at my
50:41 - uh sort of like live streaming the
50:42 - actual display out although it might
50:44 - just be more fun to have a a nice camera
50:47 - trained right on the monitor itself
50:49 - by the coding train is from now on just
50:52 - an apple 2 plus coding channel
50:54 - summer games oh i remember this game
50:57 - i remember this game i feel like i was i
51:00 - would get in trouble for look at this
51:01 - okay i think i drew that this is so
51:04 - weird
51:05 - but kind of delightful i'm sorry that
51:07 - thank you for indulging this bit of
51:08 - nostalgia from me but this here
51:12 - that's my handwriting says summer games
51:14 - and then i think this is me drawing the
51:16 - like olympic torch and those are like
51:18 - the steps up to the torch i think i just
51:20 - remember this game where to run you had
51:22 - to like press the arrow keys back and
51:24 - forth
51:26 - and i feel like i was always like break
51:28 - the computer
51:29 - these two arrow keys here
51:32 - so i think i should try to load a disk
51:35 - but
51:37 - these aren't do these things just boo
51:39 - these aren't bootable right
51:42 - i'm looking for like
51:49 - uh apple tosses thing but key control oh
51:51 - i okay so i want to look for
51:55 - like a boot disk
51:59 - pascal
52:02 - copy a fort
52:06 - fort two side one big mac assembler side
52:09 - two
52:10 - task compiler
52:12 - zoom graphics
52:14 - fort one ascii express beagle basic i
52:18 - remember this
52:23 - is this something that will just look
52:24 - requires apple 2e or 2 or 2 plus with
52:27 - ram card
52:30 - we put this in
52:32 - do this very carefully
52:36 - it's in
52:38 - closed
52:40 - now do i just turn the thing off and on
52:41 - again i hate doing this i don't want to
52:46 - most apple discs have an os on them just
52:48 - put it in and turn it on okay
52:57 - do you hear that i have noise reduction
52:59 - on
53:00 - that doesn't sound good do you hear that
53:05 - i'm putting the mic up to the disk drive
53:11 - i stuck my mic
53:14 - oh i'm typing
53:16 - ah syntax error
53:18 - all right
53:19 - all right wait
53:22 - everybody okay we're somewhere now and
53:24 - um
53:26 - i have so many cameras okay
53:29 - everyone what let's just take a moment
53:31 - here and let me do a little cleanup
53:32 - because i've made a total and my
53:34 - excitement i've made a total mess of
53:36 - this area and i want to clean it up a
53:38 - little bit i can move the camera so that
53:40 - you can see what's on the screen better
53:42 - so i could put some music on or
53:43 - something if you want but i'm probably
53:44 - just going to do this in silence
53:47 - and let me let me just organize this
53:48 - area a bit
53:50 - okay take this box over here
53:56 - because i just started like unboxing
53:58 - everything and going crazy
54:01 - and
54:02 - i just i want to be really careful with
54:04 - all this stuff especially now that it is
54:06 - i mean this now that it's working
54:15 - so i'm just off to the side talk amongst
54:18 - yourselves
54:21 - and i'm just going to move
54:23 - things that i'm not using
54:25 - i mean i think it would be nice to
54:26 - actually set this up properly the whole
54:29 - point
54:30 - is that this goes
54:33 - over it so let's see if i can get that
54:35 - let's see if i can make this work um
54:39 - type catalog okay i can't resist
54:46 - where's the
54:48 - where's the delete button
54:51 - ah
54:52 - not reset how do i go back
54:55 - there's no delete oh arrow
54:58 - no why am i typing data you said catalog
55:01 - c-a-t-a-l-o-g
55:05 - whoa the the some of these the c is not
55:07 - working
55:09 - the c is not working that's a bad oh no
55:11 - i got to work
55:12 - just had to bang on it a few times
55:16 - t
55:17 - a
55:18 - l o come on o
55:21 - come on o
55:23 - needs to wake up there just used to wake
55:25 - up g
55:30 - i think that sound is awful
55:33 - i owe error
55:35 - okay let me keep organizing myself here
55:37 - because i think everyone's going to be
55:38 - happier including myself
55:40 - if i can just get
55:42 - this set up in a way that it doesn't
55:44 - look so messy
55:46 - and
55:47 - that everybody can see it better and
55:49 - enjoy
55:50 - uh
55:51 - enjoy uh helping me along to try to get
55:54 - this thing going it's 1 30. i also i i
55:56 - as much as i would love to do this all
55:57 - day i don't know how realistic that is
55:59 - so
56:00 - this is probably going to wrap up
56:02 - relatively soon
56:04 - but this is only the beginning my
56:05 - friends
56:07 - only the beginning let me tell you
56:11 - okay
56:12 - uh
56:13 - this looks like i brought my lunch with
56:15 - me this is like this is like a 40 year
56:17 - old brown paper bag
56:20 - unbelievable
56:22 - it could be older than that
56:25 - uh this
56:27 - this is extraordinary finding these uh
56:29 - cassette tape games because i remember
56:32 - we would wait like 20 minutes to load
56:34 - these like let's play the game okay
56:35 - let's put the set in 20 minutes later
56:39 - um so again i need to set up a whole
56:42 - shelf system but i'm going to go through
56:44 - these discs so we can try some other
56:46 - ones
56:49 - but let's try to get this actually
56:52 - set up in a way now
56:54 - those of you watching i'm so
56:57 - kind of used to the idea that i can just
56:59 - turn off a computer and turn it back on
57:02 - as often as i like
57:06 - is there an issue with me doing that
57:09 - like should i be typing in some command
57:11 - like
57:13 - turn off
57:14 - i don't think that's the right command
57:17 - um let me move these oh i made myself
57:20 - this lovely coffee and i didn't even
57:22 - open it
57:26 - okay
57:28 - um
57:30 - move these things
57:42 - so
57:44 - i'm gonna put the
57:47 - put the top on
57:54 - let me just check if anybody's saying
57:56 - anything in the chat
58:00 - maybe you should type run before catalog
58:01 - to load the embedded dos no just turn it
58:05 - off
58:06 - you can turn the apple on and off with
58:08 - the switch this was before shutdown so
58:10 - yeah that's how i feel too
58:12 - okay
58:13 - so i'm gonna
58:16 - turn it off
58:17 - i'm gonna unplug it
58:20 - i feel like i need two disk drives but i
58:22 - guess i have them
58:24 - i would like now
58:27 - i'm gonna unplug
58:29 - the video cord
58:35 - come on
58:39 - put these on top
58:48 - this here
58:53 - this out of the way temporarily
59:07 - side
59:16 - looking good
59:19 - looking good everybody
59:25 - everybody okay you all doing all right
59:27 - over there
59:29 - that goes there
59:32 - this goes here
59:34 - slide it out a little bit
59:36 - there we go now
59:38 - this
59:39 - is
59:42 - okay you know what's amazing about this
59:46 - that fan
59:47 - which is blowing lovely cool air here
59:50 - all of my here a bunch of disks
59:53 - i will put here
59:57 - this card
59:58 - table and now
60:01 - [Music]
60:04 - okay just a little there we go
60:06 - everything's fine
60:07 - it's gonna go back out of the way
60:22 - now
60:23 - i have this stool here with adjustable
60:25 - height
60:33 - so
60:34 - i can sit here now let's figure out what
60:36 - i'm going to do with this camera
60:38 - so it is plugged into a lot of things
60:42 - but i'm going to attempt
60:44 - to move it
60:46 - here
60:49 - give you all
60:51 - a good shot
60:56 - there we go
60:58 - this looks promising
61:05 - and then if i sit here
61:08 - i could talk to you about my apple 2
61:10 - plus computer look at this it's like i
61:11 - professionally designed the studio to
61:13 - work like this
61:15 - although i'm in front of some of the
61:16 - most beautiful parts okay
61:18 - so we need to plug things back in again
61:21 - so
61:22 - this has to
61:30 - put this on top of the disk drive
61:33 - that's what i would like to do and then
61:34 - this goes
61:36 - oh where's the plug there
61:39 - i don't know what i'm showing you right
61:40 - now my the back of my sweater
61:44 - so
61:47 - come on where are you
61:54 - okay i'm gonna have to just pull
61:56 - this table out so i can see the back for
61:59 - a second
62:09 - here
62:11 - this gets plugged in here
62:18 - okay that's plugged in
62:21 - i'm very surprised that i actually even
62:22 - got anything
62:24 - working today and then now i need the
62:27 - video cable the analog video cable which
62:30 - is coming out of the monitor here
62:40 - one
62:43 - angled up there we go
62:45 - and this goes into
62:48 - this
62:58 - okay
63:04 - now one question i have is
63:06 - can i just leave this i wonder if i can
63:08 - leave the switch on on the back of the
63:10 - computer
63:12 - and use this as my switch to turn the
63:14 - computer on
63:15 - we're gonna find out
63:18 - okay the monitor is on
63:21 - there's a disk in here beagle brothers
63:24 - dos
63:26 - and i'm going to turn it on
63:32 - apple ii how's your view of this let me
63:34 - get my the chat over here
63:38 - the fan hangs on the back yeah i think
63:40 - that's right
63:42 - but
63:43 - i don't i'm not really set up to easily
63:45 - attach stuff right now okay i can see
63:48 - the chat
63:49 - on the side
63:51 - it's supposed to go through the slots on
63:53 - the side of the apple but you could hang
63:54 - on the stand
63:57 - seems like it's not the worst thing to
63:59 - have it right here although i guess what
64:00 - i could do this light is a little bit in
64:02 - the way
64:04 - i can move everything over
64:07 - and there's plenty of room for
64:10 - them both to have their own
64:13 - little spot
64:16 - okay
64:19 - auto start rom was introduced by apple 2
64:21 - plus in 1978 so turn on the computer
64:24 - with a bootable floppy inside rom will
64:26 - scan port to find 0x80
64:30 - bootable sequence okay
64:33 - um can't you plug the monitor into the
64:35 - system saver and then they would both
64:36 - turn on at the same time ah great point
64:39 - i could do that
64:41 - um all right the view is good says
64:44 - everybody
64:45 - um but i'm not
64:48 - seeing anything
64:51 - um
64:52 - okay so let me look through the stack of
64:55 - floppy disks
64:58 - gorgon pac-man and other games
65:02 - well let's try these one at a time
65:14 - olympic decathlon
65:16 - let's try this
65:31 - ah okay look at this
65:33 - look at this
65:36 - backup copy games disk volume 254. hello

71:24 - let's just try a different disc
71:26 - i mean i kind of want to work with
71:27 - beagle basic
71:33 - big mac assembler
71:38 - daniel schiff oh yeah so this is my
71:41 - science project
71:43 - so i did a science project in like
71:45 - fourth grade
71:47 - uh which was about i remember i don't
71:49 - really remember exactly it said summer
71:51 - it said summer games on it and then it's
71:53 - crossed out then it says daniel shiffman
71:55 - typing tutor perception
71:57 - because i made a program well let's see
71:59 - if this i remember writing a program in
72:01 - basic
72:02 - that was like doing an experiment around
72:04 - people's perception
72:07 - so we're putting this in
72:09 - we're turning it on
72:11 - apple ii
72:16 - okay look at this
72:18 - typing tutor start typing tutor hello
72:20 - perception.c
72:31 - this is amazing to me i don't know di
72:33 - can i like catalog can i just do like
72:44 - yeah so catalog will give me what's on
72:45 - the disk can you i wish i should i'm
72:47 - going to turn the noise
72:49 - suppression off it'll be very echo-y
72:50 - here but i feel like you want to hear
72:52 - the
72:53 - hear the disk drive whirring but
72:55 - um all right so
72:56 - how can i look at i want to type cat
72:59 - like where's the dot
73:02 - this is i assume this is like apple dos
73:05 - right so there must be a thing for i
73:07 - must be able to look at that
73:08 - perception.c file somehow like i would
73:11 - type cat
73:13 - and then i'd hit start typing p and then
73:15 - i'd hit tab
73:16 - the bar doesn't work good thing the
73:18 - right arrow does
73:20 - this is not going to work
73:24 - that's why i couldn't can't even type
73:25 - anything close to what's right
73:27 - syntax error um
73:32 - fortran
73:33 - c yeah uh
73:36 - print list plus print your text
73:39 - catalog
73:41 - if i type catalog and then the name of
73:44 - the file it'll list it
73:48 - i don't know who this 8-bit
73:50 - person is that everyone's referring to
73:52 - but i'll have to
73:58 - n key
74:06 - the return key seems to work one out of
74:08 - every maybe like three or four times
74:14 - syntax error
74:16 - list then list
74:18 - load load file name
74:21 - thanks everybody
74:31 - the sound of the keyboard is just lovely
74:37 - come on period
74:41 - oops no don't do another one
74:48 - okay i loaded it
74:52 - then lift
74:54 - nano
74:56 - yeah these numbers are scary that's for
74:58 - sure
75:05 - i really wish the return key would work
75:07 - a bit better
75:10 - look there's my program
75:13 - oh look at that
75:15 - that's code that i wrote like fourth
75:16 - grade i mean i think i wrote it i i mean
75:19 - i'm sure i had help i i have no memory i
75:21 - mean i have a memory of it a loose
75:22 - memory get s i print s i incorrect
75:29 - go to 180 print press any key so how do
75:32 - i run this
75:38 - oh
75:42 - i'm running at what level i don't
75:44 - what is this program that i wrote this
75:46 - is crazy okay what level
75:49 - one
75:53 - okay what did i see
75:56 - i didn't see anything it was too fast
75:59 - i saw i'll just make a guess zero nope
76:05 - i think there's a bug everybody there's
76:07 - a bug in my code
76:10 - control c there's no
76:14 - reset
76:16 - escape
76:19 - this isn't the fi the fire department's
76:21 - not going to come this isn't like
76:22 - directly wired to like some emergency
76:24 - line
76:27 - i guess i've just turned off the
76:28 - computer now
76:34 - uh yeah i can refactor i guess i'm just
76:36 - have to turn this off
76:37 - well that was fun
76:41 - another
76:42 - disc to look at
76:45 - she's going through these
76:46 - i really want to look at this beagle
76:48 - basic
76:50 - but um i guess i'll come back to that
76:52 - see what else
76:54 - ascii express super text 1989
76:59 - super text files what is super school
77:01 - backup
77:02 - i'm a little bit afraid
77:05 - to look at that
77:08 - yeah look at this this is my weird
77:10 - childhood cursive handwriting i'm pretty
77:12 - sure
77:15 - um
77:16 - daniel schiffman december 4th 1982 i
77:19 - would be nine years old then i believe
77:22 - v30 let's see what's on this
77:34 - there we go
77:41 - daniel schiffman
77:43 - december 4th 1982
77:46 - press return to go on
77:51 - this is like some real
77:53 - stranger thing style
77:56 - weird i think i inhaled a lot of dust
78:01 - hopefully i'll be okay
78:06 - file not found break in 90.
78:09 - this must be some other
78:12 - i need to get some water
78:22 - tunnels of terror sound effects
78:25 - ronald reagan's space odyssey
78:30 - apple vision viper
78:35 - dice
78:37 - typing tutor whoa windshield wiper so a
78:40 - lot of the perception which is dance
78:43 - the entertainer
78:47 - what the
78:59 - oh strange
79:01 - what are all these files
79:03 - load dice
79:08 - okay
79:09 - this looks like a program that let's see
79:11 - if we can understand this
79:13 - can you can you read the text
79:15 - it's hard for me to see
79:17 - yeah it looks like you can
79:19 - i'm looking at a preview okay
79:23 - print one two three four five six
79:26 - four i equals one to one hundred
79:29 - go sub 500
79:33 - so
79:34 - for a hundred times go to 500 which
79:37 - pits picks
79:38 - makes a variable d which is the integer
79:41 - version of six times random of one plus
79:43 - one boy this surprisingly it looks like
79:45 - code that we would write right now
79:49 - um
79:51 - return
79:54 - so then they go back return so go sub
79:56 - tells you to go down here then you hit
79:57 - return we come back here n d equals nd
80:01 - plus one now what is all this doing
80:04 - oh this is this must be v tab three h
80:07 - tab six this is like
80:09 - setting a spot on the monitor
80:11 - let's run it
80:16 - it
80:17 - did i make this
80:19 - this is wild it's rolling a die
80:22 - a virtual die
80:24 - 100 times
80:26 - and keeping track of how many times it
80:28 - rolled each number it rolled the 5 23
80:30 - times
80:35 - should be able to understand this now
80:36 - yeah look at this
80:39 - this is this is this is like
80:41 - the greatest day of my life
80:43 - [Laughter]
80:46 - uh
80:51 - i'm reading the chat now which is kind
80:52 - of fun it's a delay
80:58 - so i understand this is picking the
81:02 - right random number
81:04 - then
81:06 - n but where is n initialized
81:12 - like where did i allocate the memory for
81:14 - n does it just happen automatically like
81:16 - this is like oh we're gonna make an
81:17 - array with index
81:20 - one two three four five or this like is
81:22 - that a function that's like count so
81:27 - uh i need my computer to look up basic
81:29 - here and try to understand i want to
81:30 - write i mean like
81:33 - i mean i want to i want to write this
81:35 - code again and like learn how to do it
81:38 - i think some more names in the chat that
81:40 - i recognize
81:43 - how do i edit it
81:50 - no
81:51 - don't fall off my chair here
81:53 - you don't need to allocate small arrays
81:55 - says copper france
81:58 - [Music]
82:04 - wow this is quite
82:07 - amazing
82:08 - variables are dynamically allocated and
82:10 - initialized to zero it's basic don't
82:12 - worry about memory allocation yeah so
82:14 - how do i edit this
82:19 - i want to run it again it's too much fun
82:26 - see the pseudo random number generator
82:30 - those add up to 100 right 42
82:33 - 52 54 64 68 78
82:38 - 84 100 yep
82:42 - edit by typing a number and replacing
82:44 - that line of code
82:46 - retype a whole line
82:49 - oh
82:50 - okay
82:53 - okay let's see
82:57 - so where is the delay
83:03 - uh oh let's try okay let's try this
83:08 - for
83:10 - i
83:11 - equal
83:14 - [Music]
83:18 - shift key is a problem
83:22 - so i think one of the things i'm going
83:23 - to need to do is get um
83:25 - an air compressor to clean this
83:27 - i mean i would love to be typing on it
83:29 - directly but i could also probably get a
83:31 - different keyboard and kind of hook it
83:32 - up somehow
83:37 - i'm never going to get that equals
83:43 - is there a caps lock
83:47 - both shifts
83:50 - yeah
83:54 - no all right so this line
83:56 - how do i cancel now i don't want to mess
83:58 - with this line
84:02 - let's do this
84:05 - um
84:06 - for uh yeah
84:09 - yeah there is no delay basic on a one
84:10 - megahertz machine is just slow try the
84:12 - other shift key i certainly did all
84:14 - right um v tab
84:16 - four let's just try changing that
84:19 - 132
84:21 - v tap
84:23 - v
84:25 - stupid the space and the shift are
84:29 - oh good how do i
84:31 - what is r-e-p-t this
84:34 - this is very frustrating
84:42 - try one more time
84:45 - one three two
84:48 - v
84:51 - t
84:51 - a
84:52 - b
84:53 - b
84:54 - d
84:55 - b
84:57 - space
84:58 - so let's try v tab eight
85:06 - now let's list
85:08 - oh i edited it my code change let's be
85:11 - tab eight
85:12 - and i can run it now
85:16 - look it's down here now
85:18 - [Music]
85:20 - i wrote some new basic code today on an
85:22 - apple two plus computer is that what you
85:24 - thought you'd be seeing today live
85:27 - on youtube
85:31 - okay
85:32 - a working keyboard would make for a nice
85:33 - start yeah our ept goes repeat the keys
85:36 - do not auto repeat
85:38 - um
85:40 - uh
85:42 - line 500 is a function
85:44 - um okay all right let's um
85:49 - let's see what else we got on this
85:51 - computing machine
85:56 - anybody want to see what ronald reagan
85:58 - space odyssey is my goodness what is
86:00 - that
86:01 - draw a pencil
86:03 - we gotta look at what draw a pencil is
86:07 - tunnels of terror
86:09 - sound effects
86:11 - dice is what we're just looking at
86:14 - help
86:16 - apple vision
86:20 - star destroyer anybody had any requests
86:26 - let's look at um
86:30 - let's see what music is
86:41 - remember to git commit says ronyettes
86:45 - okay
86:48 - i think the keyboard is kind of
86:49 - loosening up here all right
86:52 - what
86:55 - what
86:55 - [Applause]
87:00 - what
87:18 - okay
87:19 - select from the following list play
87:21 - piece on disk enter new piece exit from
87:23 - program
87:25 - let's try one
87:28 - okay i'm going to load
87:31 - the entertainer must have been
87:32 - music right
87:36 - enter name of peace from the list below
87:39 - the
87:40 - space
87:42 - enter
87:43 - [Music]
87:44 - tay
87:53 - there's a speaker in it
88:12 - bum
88:16 - [Music]
88:21 - it's going again
88:24 - is it gonna stop or am i gonna have to
88:26 - turn the computer off
88:46 - all right
88:48 - enter a new piece
88:50 - let's try that
88:52 - how many beats per minute people
88:58 - 120
89:00 - select major key signature
89:03 - all right how about c
89:06 - do you want instructions
89:09 - no i don't need instructions
89:16 - i'm sorry but you're going to have to
89:18 - pause a little bit faster enter the
89:20 - value of the note or rest w is whole
89:22 - note
89:24 - you know it's amazing how little
89:26 - patience i think i have i have just like
89:28 - developed the
89:30 - quick gratification like instant
89:32 - gratification internet like
89:35 - click
89:36 - use way of being and this is like
89:39 - driving me crazy like i can't possibly
89:40 - read all these instructions and slowly
89:42 - figure out how to interact with this but
89:44 - i can
89:45 - um enter the type of note
89:48 - apple will then play the note the note
89:50 - is correct play return okay
89:54 - any key to continue what's a key that i
89:57 - know tends to work there we go good luck
90:00 - enter section one
90:26 - ah
90:27 - oh i love that
90:31 - i'm trying to enter like
90:33 - a deer a female deer
90:41 - i'm assuming x means i'm done
90:46 - how do i get out of this
90:53 - you can't hear it
90:59 - have you not been able to hit the music
91:02 - is my is my uh mic off or just like you
91:05 - can't hear
91:07 - the sound
91:17 - uh
91:20 - yeah all right um
91:25 - i don't think i've had to type in x yet
91:31 - i don't know how to get out of this
91:37 - i guess we'll be turning this computer
91:39 - off you hear a tiny bit remove the noise
91:41 - suppression okay
91:42 - let me go shut that off people
91:45 - one second
92:09 - okay the noise removal and room echo
92:12 - removal is
92:14 - off now
92:16 - so
92:20 - and let's see it's quite loud so i think
92:25 - you can hear that now i bet right
92:32 - control c exits a basic program let's
92:34 - try
92:37 - so i just don't know
92:38 - whether like the shift wasn't working so
92:42 - i have a bad feeling that control
92:44 - probably isn't working
92:47 - did you did you hear the entertainer did
92:49 - you not hear the entertainer i got to
92:51 - play you the entertainer
92:54 - all right i think i'm gonna have to just
92:56 - reboot this machine
93:02 - use b-y-e
93:06 - i don't think that's gonna work
93:09 - escape control c
93:10 - [Music]
93:14 - all right i'm gonna have to just power
93:15 - this off
93:17 - control reset i guess i could have tried
93:18 - that
93:19 - um all right let's move on to another
93:21 - disc though
93:26 - i mean
93:31 - all right let's see what else we got
93:32 - here side one volume 31 comp let's see
93:36 - what this is school backup
93:39 - all right let's look at this disc
93:48 - every floppy disk is like a little
93:50 - basket of surprises
93:52 - oh it's two o'clock i'm gonna have to go
93:54 - soon
93:56 - i would say by the way you were saying
93:57 - b-y-e and like my mind was just like
93:59 - thinking about that as a key sequence
94:01 - and uh now i realize it's spell spy
94:04 - uh lesson five lesson eight lesson nine
94:08 - flying saucers ski trek
94:12 - the guesses design the experiment comp
94:16 - so we look at what lesson five is
94:19 - oh there's like a little menu here how
94:21 - do i go down oh look at this
94:24 - this disc has like a nice little menu
94:26 - loaded with a menu so let's go to lesson
94:27 - five
94:28 - run
94:32 - what is your name do you have a computer
94:37 - uh apple
94:39 - two
94:43 - hold on
94:47 - print what is your name input t
94:51 - do you have a computer a print t
94:54 - why did it not stop at that
94:56 - so let's see
95:00 - yeah okay
95:04 - do you have a computer dan
95:10 - what kind
95:12 - um i don't know
95:16 - uh iphone
95:20 - you heard it here first
95:22 - coding trade audience
95:24 - the iphone is a good computer
95:27 - all right i think this is going to work
95:28 - so by the way i have a project i want to
95:30 - do with this computer
95:32 - um
95:33 - there's a streaming service called
95:36 - nebula that i participate in and i'm
95:38 - going to work on some videos for it
95:40 - i'll be doing stuff for the coding train
95:41 - with it as well but um this is a good
95:43 - start
95:44 - um so i think
95:46 - now how can i write let's try writing a
95:48 - new
95:50 - program
95:52 - um how do i create something new
96:01 - ah there's nothing okay
96:06 - so 10 home
96:10 - 20
96:12 - print
96:16 - oh shoot

97:16 - frustrated
97:18 - uh
97:20 - there's my program
97:22 - which is definitely not gonna work
97:25 - oh didn't need the quotes
97:31 - create file name okay
97:52 - hit the any key hold on
97:56 - i must be able to do save right
97:58 - oops
98:07 - is it trying to write on the disk
98:11 - bang on the shift key not the two key
98:12 - that's a good point
98:25 - okay
98:31 - what did it save it as
98:36 - lesson 24 calories what is that the
98:39 - experiment conversation
98:42 - hebrew
98:44 - quote camera mix smoke research
98:48 - perception b perception 3 george
98:53 - space
98:54 - space 2
98:55 - [Music]
98:57 - what are all these things
99:00 - and
99:02 - where did it save it save
99:06 - choo

99:39 - what did i call it choo choo anybody see
99:41 - it
99:44 - and there it is
99:47 - that's the new computer program i wrote
99:49 - today
99:51 - is it still loaded okay 10
100:01 - 10
100:03 - print
100:06 - chew is it gonna just let me do it
100:09 - without the quotes
100:14 - no
100:17 - oh that was whoops i overwrote the wrong
100:20 - line
100:38 - oh there we go
100:55 - look at my basic program that i have
100:57 - written everybody oh i just knocked the
100:59 - camera it's all right
101:01 - let's run it
101:04 - here we go
101:07 - okay
101:10 - um
101:14 - i don't know if there's any moderators

102:11 - homer
102:16 - so now 20
102:19 - can i do a
102:23 - equals the shift is working now people
102:26 - r and d
102:30 - shoot
102:33 - one
102:35 - or can i do like r and d two
102:44 - 30
102:46 - print
102:48 - a
102:52 - okay ah look at that it gives me a
102:53 - floating point random number
102:57 - so now we need to
103:02 - change that to
103:03 - change that to oh
103:10 - just have to
103:11 - uh 20
103:14 - a
103:16 - equals
103:18 - equals
103:20 - r and
103:21 - d
103:25 - shoot
103:27 - equals rnd
103:32 - i think it can't give it an argument i
103:34 - assume
103:36 - it's just a function times
103:40 - a 2
103:42 - which should give me a 0 or a 1.
103:46 - oops
103:51 - uh-oh syntax error
103:54 - oh
103:57 - i have to type re-type the whole thing
104:06 - does it need an argument
104:09 - or is the
104:11 - is this not right
104:22 - okay
104:25 - here we go
104:26 - now
104:30 - can i do an if like what's an if in
104:32 - basic
104:51 - i don't see a backslash
104:54 - i only see a forward slash it's gonna be
104:56 - a problem
104:57 - uh
105:02 - also that key doesn't work
105:05 - let's just do that it's going to be a
105:07 - variation on 10 print
105:14 - are there no if statements in basic
105:19 - uh
105:20 - [Music]
105:22 - well i'm getting a lot of good comments
105:24 - here
105:24 - um
105:27 - oh i need to change it to an int yeah
105:31 - and
105:36 - let's just see let's just at least see
105:38 - if i can do
105:40 - so if i want to add a line i could do 15
105:43 - and i could say 4i
105:46 - how do i do a loop
105:52 - 4
105:54 - i
106:01 - what's the chance that's right
106:07 - no
106:08 - i think you need it then oh then
106:19 - did you all hear that
106:20 - that was a very bad sound and there's
106:22 - smoke
106:26 - i'd shut it off
106:28 - oh this is bad
106:34 - okay
106:35 - let's unplug everything
106:37 - safety first people
106:40 - oh no
106:41 - this is the one and only time i'm ever
106:43 - gonna get to do this
106:44 - unplugged everything
106:54 - oh it's a bad smell
106:57 - i'm gonna open a window over here
107:10 - let's back the camera up people
107:18 - i'm sure someone's gonna clip that
107:21 - little moment there
107:23 - the thing is everything was i don't know
107:24 - what what started to um
107:28 - i'm hoping it's just the power supply
107:30 - that's a
107:31 - that can be remedied
107:37 - this was fun while it lasted
107:45 - let's move this
107:50 - over here okay
107:54 - um
108:00 - that smell is awful
108:14 - i think it's
108:17 - i the
108:18 - it's the power supply
108:22 - oh it's still smoking
108:42 - okay i'm going to examine this later on
108:44 - my own time
108:46 - i'm going to first
108:49 - unplug
108:55 - this from the extension cord
109:01 - i wonder
109:05 - i mean
109:15 - i don't feel still smoking
109:20 - it doesn't feel super hot
109:26 - maybe switch to an apple ii emulator
109:29 - yeah
109:31 - um all right uh let me
109:36 - just come back over here for a moment
109:43 - um
109:46 - that was a little bit uh freaky
109:59 - uh oop here i am
110:02 - all right uh the light is not on me
110:04 - right now so it's a little bit dark
110:08 - um i'm very sad
110:12 - it was fun while it lasted oh that smell
110:15 - is terrible just looking at the chat
110:21 - um
110:23 - okay
110:28 - all right everyone i don't know if
110:29 - there's still people here watching i
110:31 - think i'm gonna
110:33 - call it a day but i've got a few things
110:35 - maybe that i can briefly mention or
110:39 - discuss let's turn
110:42 - to reset up the setup again
110:51 - at least get the lighting back
110:53 - the way it's supposed to be
111:08 - okay sorry everyone i'm
111:11 - okay um
111:15 - whoa that smell
111:17 - i cannot tell you how strong it is i
111:20 - mean it's like burning rubber or
111:21 - something
111:22 - um
111:24 - all right so
111:25 - uh thank you all for tuning in to
111:27 - today's live stream
111:29 - i'm not entirely sure what the purpose
111:31 - of it was i was having a grand old time
111:33 - until i heard that sound and started to
111:35 - see smoke on that apple two plus
111:36 - computer i hope this is not the only
111:39 - time
111:40 - that i am ever able to uh
111:43 - work with this machine or stream from it
111:45 - or so i'm gonna work on giving it a
111:47 - permanent home somewhere and kind of
111:50 - investigate
111:52 - it in more detail in my own time if
111:54 - anybody is watching happens to be an
111:56 - expert or have some tips for me or wants
111:58 - to put me in touch with someone that
111:59 - could help me restore the computer to
112:02 - its former glory i would love to hear
112:04 - that
112:05 - um
112:07 - psu capacitor pops you can purchase
112:10 - replacements says robbie in the chat hi
112:12 - robbie all right that's great to know
112:15 - some money from galvey to go to a recap
112:17 - service on my apple ii plus
112:20 - tends to be a lot of plastic in those
112:21 - old things so i can imagine the smell
112:23 - smell says eric typical apple device all
112:26 - right so i just want to briefly since
112:29 - i'm here
112:30 - and there are
112:32 - some small number of you watching i
112:34 - couldn't tell you how many
112:36 - um
112:38 - um i just want to briefly mention
112:42 - um
112:43 - um thank you chris
112:45 - uh get it recapped professionally what
112:48 - does what does that mean exactly uh
112:50 - because by golly i would love to have a
112:52 - professional come and restore this
112:54 - machine
112:54 - um
112:56 - but um i guess so while i'm here
113:00 - um i might as well mention this sort of
113:02 - goofy project that i'm working on
113:04 - related to the well
113:06 - it's related to the television show
113:07 - severance but the way i was putting that
113:10 - sounded like
113:11 - like i have some official
113:14 - thing that i'm doing which i don't at
113:16 - all
113:17 - um
113:18 - let's get
113:19 - going here and uh let's show you up the
113:23 - at the computer
113:25 - and i i'm a little bit brain dead right
113:27 - now i'm going to go to github.com
113:30 - lumen industries
113:32 - so um i'm just just a massive fan of the
113:35 - show which had the finale last night
113:38 - um and uh so first of all if you're
113:42 - i'm not gonna spoil anything from it
113:43 - please chat uh be on your best behavior
113:46 - um i would um so but i am gonna show
113:49 - this little project which is based on a
113:51 - piece of software that runs in the show
113:54 - with uh on one of these computers i
113:56 - don't think they're actually using one
113:58 - of these computers it's a prop
114:00 - um
114:00 - data general dasher d2
114:05 - not a t200 so um
114:09 - i showed this on twitch earlier this
114:11 - week but so this is the computer that uh
114:14 - i believe is in the show um
114:16 - and i'm not going to search um
114:19 - uh but like i think if i search like
114:21 - macro data refinement and do like an
114:24 - image search
114:26 - you'll see there's this um
114:28 - there's this software that the
114:30 - characters of the show
114:32 - are
114:33 - working with
114:35 - so i've been slowly
114:37 - over time building my own version of
114:39 - this software
114:40 - um and i'm going to show it to you now
114:43 - uh if you go and i was going to work on
114:45 - it today but i've run out of steam
114:48 - so if people are really interested in
114:49 - this tweet at me at shiffman
114:51 - uh and are like i'm gonna talk join the
114:54 - coding train discord i'll i'll talk
114:56 - about how you can get involved if you're
114:57 - interested in helping with this so this
114:59 - is the github repository for this
115:01 - project um if i go here and click on
115:03 - lumenindustries.com
115:06 - um you'll see this is my version
115:07 - actually somebody submitted a pull
115:08 - request adjusting the colors of it which
115:10 - was really good but it has some
115:13 - um
115:15 - has some issues with it
115:18 - so basically the idea here is that i
115:20 - need to find the scary numbers
115:23 - and bin them properly
115:26 - and then
115:28 - and i'm going to do a little hack here
115:30 - which is that if i just go into the
115:32 - console and overwrite the goal variable
115:34 - and set it to ten oh first of all it's
115:36 - gonna set me at 75 percent
115:39 - immediately benjamin durgo came for the
115:42 - and now i'm at a hundred percent so this
115:44 - is what i'm most proud of
115:46 - i created this share button
115:49 - which when you click it
115:51 - it copies your
115:53 - the address of the data that you just
115:56 - refined
115:58 - and a little message that you can share
116:01 - on social media so if i go to
116:02 - twitter.com
116:06 - mdr lumen
116:10 - um
116:11 - you can see here people are posting
116:15 - their data that they refined
116:17 - a la wordle and nothing is bringing me
116:20 - more
116:21 - happiness than seeing this right now but
116:25 - it needs a lot more work and guess what
116:28 - severance was renewed for a season two i
116:31 - don't know what i'm going to do for the
116:32 - next year
116:33 - i'm going to work on this
116:35 - i'm going to get back to coding train
116:37 - tutorials and things i would love
116:39 - especially if any of you are fans of the
116:40 - show to participate we can create a
116:42 - channel in the coding train discord i've
116:44 - been tracking
116:46 - um issues of things that i want to add
116:49 - to it here
116:50 - uh
116:51 - the ver the kind of first thing that i
116:54 - think i'd really like to do which i
116:55 - think would be quick is include the
116:56 - amount of time it took to refine the
116:58 - data
116:59 - um so that at least when you're posting
117:01 - a report to twitter it's a little bit
117:02 - more like it took you one minute 30
117:05 - seconds i'm sure there's some clever
117:07 - language we could come up with um
117:09 - there are also uh there's an e-book that
117:11 - the apple tv put out and that you can
117:14 - find which has like these are the actual
117:16 - rewards you're supposed to get at ten
117:17 - percent
117:18 - twenty-five percent
117:20 - seventy-five i have the seventy-five
117:21 - percent i mean that could be improved
117:23 - and 100 reward
117:25 - so um if any of you are interested in
117:28 - helping to develop this piece of
117:30 - software
117:32 - um
117:33 - by the way i'm just curious i'm gonna i
117:35 - know
117:36 - i'm he's
117:39 - changing subjects every five seconds
117:41 - here but i'm going to just quickly turn
117:43 - on
117:44 - the
117:45 - um
117:47 - noise removal uh and just sort of see i
117:49 - just quickly turn that on and i'm just
117:51 - curious if the sound i mean obviously
117:53 - when i was working with the apple ii
117:54 - plus we wanted to hear those noises but
117:56 - is the sound better worse the same
117:59 - i'm just curious to hear from you so
118:01 - i've been sort of tracking issues and
118:03 - things
118:05 - this is the pull request that um
118:06 - somebody graciously added but it has
118:08 - some conflicts in it i think uh
118:10 - adjusting the colors oh i would love to
118:12 - put in a um
118:14 - um
118:15 - i'd love to put in a like um
118:18 - i bet you we could do like a crt
118:21 - shader filter on the canvas
118:24 - that's probably something that i could
118:26 - learn how to do right
118:28 - just adding just adding issues i don't
118:30 - know does anybody have any questions
118:31 - about this any interest in it um i would
118:34 - love to hear from you um i also want to
118:36 - give a plug
118:39 - since i'm uh
118:40 - a plug here oh god that smell
118:43 - i'm very sensitive to certain kinds of
118:44 - smells like a bleach smell i can't be in
118:47 - the room get very sick and the smell is
118:49 - having that effect on me which i think
118:50 - is why i'm really struggling to continue
118:52 - this stream so
118:55 - sound is way better with the noise
118:56 - removal and the echo is completely gone
118:58 - yeah um yeah it actually and i only put
119:00 - it on 75 so this is using um my graphics
119:03 - card on this streaming machine the
119:05 - nvidia rtx broadcast software i mean i
119:08 - should sound treat the room that would
119:09 - be the proper way to do it but
119:12 - um i'm just curious uh
119:14 - i could i'm just also curious like while
119:16 - i'm here to turn it way up
119:18 - like um
119:20 - like i'm gonna turn it
119:21 - uh all the way up now i did open the
119:24 - door
119:25 - uh the thing about the garage
119:28 - fishy in the chat and thank you fishy uh
119:31 - fishy has created
119:33 - uh more
119:35 - uh this wonderful i don't um
119:38 - uh
119:39 - uh has been working on here it is has
119:42 - been working on a visualization for
119:45 - um
119:46 - what happens when you reach 100 for this
119:49 - little like animated sequence that
119:50 - happens in the show
119:52 - um so this is a fun uh based off of i
119:54 - think the pearl and noise terrain so
119:56 - there's a lot of potential there um so
119:59 - i'm going to turn it all the way up i'm
120:00 - just curious so now i'm at a hundred
120:02 - percent of noise removal and echo
120:05 - uh removal i'm just curious if better or
120:07 - worse i mean it's like you're at the eye
120:09 - doctor now
120:10 - um so
120:13 - anyway there's lots of things on this
120:15 - list i uh would love any contributions
120:18 - anybody wants to work on this with me
120:21 - uh i mean i do need to put this to the
120:23 - side and like kind of get back to some
120:26 - things i've totally made a mess of this
120:28 - room
120:30 - i don't know why i'm feeling so
120:32 - discouraged all of a sudden
120:33 - but
120:35 - uh
120:38 - using an ai filter on the graphics card
120:40 - is more on brand than physically sound
120:43 - which is very true thank you chris
120:45 - so um yeah so i guess i could keep
120:48 - talking about this i could come back and
120:50 - do another stream about it and like sort
120:52 - of work on this more if there's interest
120:53 - you can check
120:54 - let me just ah if you're really
120:55 - interested in this i'm sorry
120:58 - i will tell you what to do
121:02 - if you go to the youtube channel called
121:04 - coding train twitch archive um this is
121:08 - where i
121:10 - uh archive any streams that i'm doing on
121:13 - twitch and write
121:14 - so many important things to mention okay
121:16 - okay important coding train news
121:18 - announcements
121:21 - i i i kind of was setting up a new sound
121:23 - board
121:29 - that's an interesting noise bumper that
121:31 - i don't have all these bumpers from old
121:33 - times
121:40 - um okay what is this
121:43 - okay sorry sorry having fun over here
121:46 - all right um
121:51 - okay uh
121:53 - what was i going to say yes all right
121:57 - announcements
121:59 - there is a survey
122:04 - let's see if we can find it
122:08 - on uh on uh it's been shared via coding
122:10 - train social media ah yes here we go
122:12 - here it is thank you everyone has filled
122:14 - out the survey we are expecting
122:17 - it we are extending the deadline to
122:19 - april 4th ah that deadline is officially
122:21 - today
122:22 - april 8th today is the la i mean you can
122:24 - fill out the survey after the deadline
122:26 - but i need to next week
122:29 - i will i mean i was going to do it today
122:30 - is there a way i could do it today
122:32 - i'm going to figure out how to do this
122:34 - live without giving out any of these
122:35 - information
122:36 - but i want to i'll document somehow how
122:38 - we are picking the the uh
122:42 - to send the stickers but this is a
122:43 - survey just for feedback i'm kind of
122:45 - planning the rest of the year thinking
122:46 - about what i want to do one of the items
122:49 - on the survey is whether you prefer to
122:51 - watch live streams on youtube or twitch
122:54 - i can tell you right now spoiler alert
122:56 - the overwhelming response
122:59 - is about 75 25 on youtube but that's
123:01 - mostly because i've been posting the
123:03 - survey
123:04 - through check through various um
123:08 - uh channels i'm not a
123:11 - communication channels that are
123:13 - people are finding because they know
123:15 - about the youtube channel so i'm a
123:16 - little worried it's heavily biased there
123:18 - so again i said this on twitch earlier i
123:20 - don't want to put my thumb on the scale
123:22 - but if you're excited about um kind of
123:24 - bouncing a bit back and forth between
123:26 - twitch and youtube i would love to hear
123:27 - from you and what the sort of benefits
123:29 - of one platform versus the other are my
123:31 - kind of plan although
123:34 - there's no evidence that i'm putting
123:35 - this into motion is that twitch is more
123:37 - of a place for some sort of informal
123:39 - casual streams and youtube is the place
123:40 - where my properly
123:42 - planned and professionally produced
123:45 - it doesn't really exist but that's sort
123:47 - of an idea thank you me i am so me for
123:49 - posting the survey so um one of the
123:51 - things on the survey you don't it's an
123:53 - anonymous survey but if you want to be
123:54 - entered to win some coding train
123:56 - stickers you can put your email in there
123:57 - so that's important item number one
124:00 - um
124:01 - [Music]
124:04 - item
124:05 - number
124:07 - two
124:10 - oh
124:11 - in my head i was like oh i have three or
124:12 - four announcements and i started talking
124:14 - about the survey well there's a new
124:15 - website coming i really should be
124:17 - working i shouldn't be live streaming i
124:18 - should be working on that website
124:21 - i got to get back to recording coding
124:22 - challenges i've got tutorial i've got so
124:24 - much to do
124:25 - um
124:28 - all right let's talk about um
124:30 - let's talk about uh
124:32 - then so if you've missed the twitch
124:34 - streams you can find the archive of them
124:37 - here and in particular there's a whole
124:39 - stream i did about
124:42 - the macro data basically
124:44 - uh refinement program
124:47 - and i would be glad for you to check
124:49 - that out and contribute uh
124:52 - participate in the issues file any pull
124:54 - requests hit me up on discord on twitter
124:56 - et cetera et cetera at least just play
124:58 - the game share your results let's bring
125:01 - macro data refinement to the to the
125:03 - masses people
125:05 - uh and then i mean this is the la i'm
125:07 - just also going to shout out uh because
125:09 - i've gotten so obsessed with the show
125:10 - i've been listening to
125:12 - a podcast where some neuroscientists and
125:16 - psychologists
125:17 - are talking about various elements of
125:19 - the show
125:20 - and you can find that i would highly
125:21 - recommend if you just watch the full
125:23 - season i happen to be
125:25 - uh uh very poorly giving some of my
125:28 - takes in a very inelegant
125:30 - way
125:32 - on this particular episode eight
125:34 - feedback but i'm sure the new
125:36 - uh
125:37 - recaps of the finale will be posted soon
125:39 - so check that out it's a wonderful
125:41 - community of people who enjoy analyzing
125:43 - talking and discussing uh various um
125:45 - television shows i haven't gotten into a
125:47 - show like this in i don't know
125:49 - i can't remember when since when maybe
125:51 - lost
125:53 - many years ago i tried to get my kids to
125:55 - watch lost their kindling
125:58 - not interested i mean i think the
126:00 - um
126:01 - severance is is not appropriate for them
126:03 - but uh so if you're very young it's fine
126:06 - there's nothing really terribly uh it's
126:09 - it's it's dark it's a dark dark show so
126:12 - you know proceed with caution
126:14 - um
126:15 - duo q life says thank you that's a nice
126:18 - comment i i sometimes i feel like i
126:19 - shouldn't read the like complimentary
126:21 - comments
126:22 - like back to you because it's very
126:24 - self-aggrandizing but i do appreciate
126:26 - your kind feedback i think i got to be
126:28 - done today
126:29 - um
126:29 - [Music]
126:32 - um and simon i'm reading your feedback
126:35 - simon's giving me some feedback in the
126:36 - discord about me i also used to do these
126:38 - member-only streams
126:40 - i was doing really well like 2022 i was
126:44 - shot out of a cannon and i was streaming
126:46 - every week i was making coding
126:48 - challenges like like january and even
126:50 - some of february i was just like i had
126:52 - all this steam and i went away and
126:54 - there's been a lot of stuff going on and
126:57 - uh life gets in the way um
126:59 - but i think now i have a couple m i have
127:02 - a big project i'm working on
127:04 - that's gonna kind of get in my way a
127:05 - little bit the next couple weeks but i'm
127:07 - hoping to get back into the routine of
127:08 - things
127:09 - um and thank you
127:11 - oh i should see halt and catch fire
127:14 - okay yeah i mean lost
127:16 - don't get me started on like the last
127:18 - season i just mean like at its prime
127:20 - right lori thank you for your feedback
127:22 - and it's prime you know what was that i
127:25 - was thinking about numbers then
127:28 - um
127:29 - uh francella i am on sabbatical yes and
127:31 - and i have to say
127:35 - i mean surely i miss teaching i miss it
127:37 - more than i thought i would
127:39 - and also it's not the thing that's in
127:41 - the way of me being sort of like
127:42 - productive and doing all the things i
127:44 - want to do i mean it's definitely it
127:45 - keeps me
127:47 - i'm my own worst enemy i think when it
127:49 - comes to
127:50 - um trying to
127:53 - develop a sort of regular routine of
127:58 - of
128:00 - of making videos and working through i
128:02 - get i get very distracted and i get
128:04 - really obsessed with weird little things
128:05 - and get stuck on little technical
128:06 - problems so i don't know anyway
128:09 - um
128:11 - it's been a lot to try to set up this
128:12 - new studio and um
128:15 - i just want to make sure there's no
128:16 - smoke still i just don't want anything
128:17 - to be like i do have a smoke detector
128:19 - over there it didn't go off so i don't
128:21 - think it was that bad
128:23 - if you're just tuning in
128:25 - what you missed is
128:28 - the glorious glorious moment like
128:32 - this was like a
128:33 - one of the highlights of my entire life
128:35 - was setting up this old apple 2 plus
128:37 - computer from my childhood i was running
128:39 - my old basic programs from elementary
128:41 - school and then it made some horrible
128:43 - sounds smoke started coming out of it
128:46 - and i don't know what to do now i need i
128:48 - need help like as much as i want to be
128:50 - the person
128:51 - who could fix this myself that's not i'm
128:53 - not really a
128:54 - i'm not really a hardware person maybe i
128:56 - can give it a try but if you're out
128:58 - there you know somebody who's out there
129:00 - who can help me restore this
129:02 - um
129:03 - yeah especially if you're in the new
129:05 - york area within like a
129:08 - three or four hour drive of like
129:09 - poughkeepsie like please come over
129:13 - get me up come over
129:14 - like very soon because i need to i'm
129:16 - planning to use this for a project later
129:18 - this month but anyway maybe i'll have to
129:20 - postpone that we'll see
129:21 - um
129:22 - but i would like to hear from you
129:24 - uh
129:25 - all right um coming back over here i i
129:28 - can't i can't go
129:30 - uh
129:33 - hi nicole uh
129:35 -  my shader expert nicole i see you
129:37 - in the chat
129:38 - uh lifelong learner thank you
129:41 - um i'm sorry i'm read this chat is fun
129:44 - to read sometimes uh hcf an amazing team
129:47 - of drama yeah somebody was telling me
129:49 - actually on the podcast
129:51 - um
129:52 - the show devs was recommended to me and
129:55 - in fact maybe related to
129:57 - [Music]
129:59 - some of the um
130:00 - themes
130:01 - that are also in severance so
130:04 - anyway
130:05 - the severance community on twitter it's
130:07 - it's popping
130:10 - come and say hello there
130:12 - uh there are youtubers who do those
130:14 - fixes yeah uh seb can i get seb lee
130:17 - delisle to fly fly in from the uk
130:21 - somebody asked um to give you some help
130:24 - like seb is always was restoring
130:26 - something yesterday on his channel um
130:28 - adrian's digital basement okay
130:31 - thank you i'm gonna need all of these
130:33 - told to me again
130:37 - this scientific american
130:39 - at least did not catch on fire
130:41 - all right let's ah all right so
130:44 - we looked at the apple plus
130:45 - i talked about the survey i talked about
130:48 - my obsession with the show severance and
130:50 - macro data refinement here's a question
130:52 - for you
130:54 - what would you think
130:56 - and i probably shouldn't do this because
130:58 - it'll take an enormous amount of time
130:59 - away from other things that maybe are i
131:01 - should be spending my time on
131:03 - but if i did something that was like a
131:05 - video essay style
131:07 - short 10 minute video
131:10 - maybe narrating um kind of describing
131:13 - some of the technology or this you know
131:15 - science fiction technology that's in the
131:17 - show severance and giving some sort of
131:19 - thoughts and opinions about what's what
131:22 - could be real what wouldn't be real
131:24 - um
131:26 - how it might work
131:27 - um it's not the kind of video i make on
131:30 - the coding train at all would that be of
131:32 - interest
131:34 - let me know
131:36 - and then silicon valley yeah i don't i
131:39 - never got into that um
131:41 - but um i could give that a try for sure
131:44 - um
131:46 - ah all right and then here's what i want
131:48 - to
131:49 - look
131:50 - at i need
131:57 - to keep tr i need to spin the wheel
131:59 - i need to pick a coding challenge to do
132:01 - next week
132:02 - because i i got to get back to that
132:05 - so i've already forgotten
132:08 - how in the world
132:10 - where in the world this list that i'm
132:12 - keeping is
132:14 - but
132:21 - let's see if i can find it
132:23 - um
132:26 - desktop backup okay
132:34 - i think this should give me to me
132:38 - okay
132:40 - all right
132:44 - uh
132:48 - okay
132:50 - this would be appropriate right
132:52 - to do as a coding chat oh you don't see
132:53 - the screen i'm sorry everybody
132:56 - um sorry everybody
133:00 - um
133:05 - uh
133:10 - this is my list of things i had some
133:12 - things that i wanted to add to it
133:14 - and i'm waiting for the chat to catch up
133:15 - to me
133:17 - so let's see what do what's
133:19 - what have i already done
133:21 - i did the mandelbulb
133:23 - remove
133:25 - i did the ulam spiral
133:28 - remove
133:33 - did the n-body problem
133:36 - remove
133:40 - now people have been giving me some
133:41 - really good ideas
133:44 - and i would like to add to them let me
133:45 - just do a little screenshot of this
133:51 - but i don't have an easy way to edit and
133:54 - add things to this app that i created
133:56 - so let's just let's just keep this as my
133:58 - list right now
134:02 - um
134:04 - let's let's
134:06 - let's keep this as my list
134:08 - let's spin it
134:11 - and see what we get some of these i
134:12 - don't feel so great about
134:14 - others i would be thrilled if it landed
134:16 - on
134:17 - and there were some really good ideas
134:19 - that people have been suggesting
134:20 - recently and i'm not doing a good job of
134:21 - keeping track of them let's just
134:24 - um i think one of my uh things i really
134:28 - like to develop
134:29 - in
134:33 - dream to do
134:35 - as simon will tell you
134:38 - anytime i make one of these markdown
134:39 - files there's a list of something i
134:41 - never go back to it
134:43 - um but i do feel like
134:45 - there were some really uh
134:49 - there were some good ones recently
134:53 - that i wanted to
134:56 - work work on
134:58 - but
134:59 - i guess
135:01 - i'm just gonna spin this let's just do
135:02 - it
135:05 - all
135:06 - right
135:08 - let's just do it wave function collapse
135:10 - algorithm that is what i'm rooting for
135:12 - if i'm being honest with you this is
135:14 - what i'm rooting for
135:20 - i'm spinning it i'm gonna stop it
135:24 - i don't think i have a drum roll here
135:25 - yes i do
135:29 - let's see what we get
135:32 - so i have a lot of videos doing neat
135:35 - like algorithms oh these are bo i'm okay
135:37 - k means
135:39 - image stippling would be i'm fine oh
135:40 - come on wave collapse function you're so
135:42 - close
135:47 - nope
135:50 - uh
135:53 - image stippling
135:54 - i'll take it
135:58 - i don't know
136:04 - image stippling it is
136:05 - [Music]
136:13 - thank you all
136:14 - i really appreciate all of you who watch
136:16 - the coding train and support me and and
136:19 - just by watching frankly uh by giving me
136:22 - your feedback
136:23 - um
136:25 - and
136:26 - uh i'm we you could out vote
136:29 - i mean i could put it to a poll it's
136:32 - close
136:37 - uh you know
136:42 - you're obviously
136:45 - the core audience
136:46 - the most dedicated audience
136:49 - of the coding train right now the wheel
136:51 - needs a nudge button
136:54 - uh you know
136:57 - let's put some other i can i do more
136:58 - polls
136:59 - i can only do one poll at a time now i
137:01 - just want to keep doing polls i'll do
137:02 - some twitter polls
137:05 - i really can't believe that the apple ii
137:08 - plus like
137:09 - caught on fire i mean i don't know if
137:10 - caught on fire is too strong
137:14 - i need to eat i didn't eat lunch it's
137:16 - three o'clock my kids are gonna be home
137:17 - from school it's gonna be the weekend
137:18 - it's a beautiful sunny out i should go i
137:20 - should go
137:22 - i've already played the sound effect
137:24 - thank you for watching
137:26 - um i'm going to
137:28 - wow
137:30 - uh you know
137:32 - wave function collapse is just taking it
137:35 - by maybe i shouldn't use a wheel i
137:36 - should just use a pole
137:38 - i could pick a few things that i'm
137:39 - interested in put them in the poll
137:43 - um
137:45 - why why do i need this wheel what does
137:46 - that be picked randomly
137:48 - wave function collapse let's do that
137:50 - next week people it'll be make for a
137:51 - wonderful video
137:53 - um
137:55 - oh great
137:56 - oh simon you are so great
137:59 - simon offered me the list towers of
138:00 - hanoi koningsberg bridge problem ray
138:03 - marching sdf rendering sudoku petrus
138:06 - sokoban
138:08 - all right
138:12 - i'm in the market
138:15 - for
138:16 - a web application i mean i should make
138:19 - this myself i should just do a stream
138:20 - where i make it
138:23 - where web applications will help me keep
138:24 - track of this stuff but until then
138:28 - thank you so much
138:31 - i appreciate all of you
138:33 - i hope you enjoyed
138:35 - this

138:40 - the side
138:43 - um let's put this camera back like where
138:45 - it normally this would be the whiteboard
138:47 - shot
138:48 - and uh i'm gonna put the camera back

139:06 - um
139:07 - you can check me out on episode 8 of the
139:10 - post show recaps
139:12 - severance feedback show but don't listen
139:15 - to that episode listen to all the other
139:16 - ones
139:18 - nothing would make me happier than
139:19 - people being like oh i found the second
139:22 - podcast from the coding train and those
139:24 - communities colliding in some way i
139:26 - don't know
139:27 - um
139:32 - um
139:33 - next week i'll be back with some live

140:56 - box somewhere
140:58 - but i
140:59 - [Music]
