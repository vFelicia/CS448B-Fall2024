00:00 - hi you're about to watch a video about a
00:03 - library I'm really excited about P 5
00:04 - speech I'm gonna introduce what P 5
00:06 - speech is and who made it in a second
00:08 - but before I do that I just want to
00:10 - mention I have a small error in the code
00:12 - in this video if you look at this
00:13 - video's description I explain what that
00:16 - error is it's a it's a minor thing but
00:17 - if you're typing along you might run
00:19 - into an issue so take a look at that
00:20 - description and you'll see what it is
00:23 - now enjoy the video hello I am here
00:27 - again in my chat pot series I'm gonna do
00:29 - two tutorials and then some other stuff
00:32 - about something called p5.js speech so
00:34 - I'm gonna get to what that is in a
00:35 - second but the reason why I'm doing this
00:37 - is as part of the chatbot series I want
00:40 - to investigate chatbots that a human can
00:43 - interact with by typing and chatbots
00:46 - that a human can interact with by
00:48 - speaking and so in order to do the
00:50 - speaking part without purchasing some
00:52 - kind of proprietary device from some
00:55 - company that's supposed to be your
00:57 - assistant or something like that
00:59 - alright which I will look at later
01:00 - eventually I want to see if we can do
01:03 - this in a bit of more of an open-source
01:04 - way we looked at rive script can we just
01:08 - can we converse can we talk to the
01:09 - browser the web browser have it listen
01:11 - to what we're saying and talk back to us
01:12 - and the answer is yes and so there's a
01:15 - library for p5.js which is which was
01:18 - created by Luke Du Bois from the
01:20 - integrated digital media program at New
01:23 - York University standard school for
01:24 - engineering the ability project is part
01:26 - of the ability projects research which
01:27 - is an interdisciplinary research space
01:29 - then it came to the intersection between
01:30 - disability and technologies so it's a
01:33 - great program it's great research group
01:34 - you can you can imagine why speech to
01:37 - text and text to speech could be useful
01:39 - in this area for for for accessibility
01:44 - of different tools that exist on the
01:46 - Internet okay so there which is a really
01:48 - important topic so but I mean this video
01:51 - just want to kind of learn how the
01:51 - library works and kind of do a few
01:53 - playful things with it so this is the
01:56 - webpage for the library I recently made
01:57 - some changes to the API the naming
02:00 - convention of some of these functions
02:01 - and so who what's what's here right now
02:04 - might actually be different than what
02:05 - you see when you go to this page but so
02:07 - I'm going to use this new naming oh and
02:09 - this is a demonstration but I'll come
02:10 - back to that all right so let's just
02:12 - let's for
02:12 - look at how easy this is to use which I
02:15 - think it is it is it's easy it's gonna
02:16 - be easy so the first thing that you want
02:18 - going to want to do is actually download
02:20 - the Java library from github itself and
02:24 - I will provide in this video's
02:25 - description a link to where you can
02:26 - download that javascript file you can
02:28 - see that I've downloaded is here already
02:30 - and it's part of my project now how you
02:33 - end up incorporating this library into
02:35 - your example it can be different
02:36 - depending on what text editor or
02:38 - development environment you're using and
02:40 - hopefully I can help you with that
02:41 - but for the way that I'm working right
02:43 - here is I just have all the people I've
02:44 - just libraries and I'm adding p5 speech
02:47 - KS and I've got to make sure all so then
02:49 - I go to my sorry I go to my index.html
02:55 - file associated with that this sketch
02:57 - and go right here copy paste this and
03:00 - I'm just gonna add a reference to p5
03:03 - speech task
03:04 - so let's even see if that does anything
03:06 - we go back to the browser hit refresh
03:09 - okay
03:10 - nothing but at least I'm not I don't get
03:12 - I'm not having an error so let me look
03:14 - at the most basic thing that you could
03:15 - do with the speech library which is just
03:17 - have the browser speak so if I go to the
03:20 - github page and I look down here this is
03:23 - kind of just a little bit of code so I'm
03:24 - gonna grab this I'm gonna go to my
03:28 - sketch KS in setup I'm going to add and
03:32 - I'm gonna change this to let and I'm
03:35 - gonna say have it's a coding train so
03:38 - what I need to do and I think this is
03:40 - gonna be okay but there's the there's a
03:43 - bunch of there's a variety of issues
03:44 - that I'm going to show you and things
03:46 - that you could do but just just for the
03:47 - basic idea I need to create a p5 speech
03:50 - object voice equals new p v dot speech
03:54 - and i just need to call voice dot speak
03:56 - let's just see if this works this is
04:01 - something I'm gonna show you in a minute
04:02 - coding train did you hear that coding
04:06 - train it speaks to me okay so that's
04:10 - basically it so one of the nice things
04:11 - is I'm done like if I have some text you
04:15 - know I could have a whole interactive
04:16 - system when I click the mouse or I do
04:17 - this button or whatever and it then it
04:19 - speaks it doesn't speak you could say
04:20 - anything the text could be generative it
04:22 - could use any of my you know weird crazy
04:24 - like generate poetry
04:25 - examples but they're the reason why I is
04:28 - not gonna just end this video right now
04:30 - is the library actually provides a bunch
04:33 - of other features now these features are
04:35 - dependent on the web speech API and if I
04:38 - understand it correctly you're kind of
04:42 - limited to what the browser supports so
04:44 - which voices are available does it
04:46 - actually work so I'm doing this all in
04:47 - Chrome on a Mac and I imagine some of
04:49 - you might try this in different browsers
04:51 - a different operating systems so let me
04:52 - know what works and what doesn't work
04:54 - maybe we can contribute to the library
04:56 - if it doesn't work in a certain browser
04:57 - to help it work but again the browser
04:59 - has to support the web speech feature
05:01 - and okay but one of the things you can
05:05 - do is actually change the voice so let's
05:07 - let's look at how I might do that so I
05:10 - think I can say something like
05:13 - console.log voice dot voices so in this
05:17 - voice object I probably maybe I'll call
05:19 - this speech just to be less confusing
05:22 - there is a property which is a list of
05:25 - all of the different voices that are
05:27 - supportive so let's hit refresh and look
05:31 - at this of poises not defined alright
05:33 - speech coding trainer but look it's
05:37 - empty so here's the thing you don't have
05:40 - to wait for it to be ready if all you
05:44 - want to do is use the default voice but
05:46 - if you want to try a different voice you
05:48 - need a callback a vend callback that
05:50 - says like hey i've loaded all the other
05:53 - possible voices and the way that you do
05:55 - that is by passing in an argument to the
05:57 - new p5 speech constructor I can say
06:00 - something like voice ready then I can
06:04 - write a function called voice ready and
06:08 - in that function I can console.log
06:12 - speech type voices I think this is gonna
06:14 - work coding train so now we can see this
06:18 - whole list of voices and witty what
06:21 - there's a lot of them like there's 82 of
06:23 - them and what's one that I might want to
06:25 - be interested in look they all have
06:26 - names so we can look here and and the
06:29 - name is actually important it's the key
06:32 - word you can use to assign a different
06:34 - voice I happen to know there's one
06:35 - called cellos I think so one thing I
06:38 - want to just add here
06:39 - I'm just gonna add the mousepressed
06:41 - function and in the mouse press function
06:44 - I'm going to say speech dot speak coding
06:48 - tree so let's just make sure this works
06:51 - whoops ah so I need to make speech a
06:54 - global variable let speech hit refresh
06:59 - coding train coding train coding trains
07:02 - but every time I click the mouse it
07:03 - speaks but in theory now I should be
07:06 - able to say let's just try assigning a
07:09 - voice speech dot voice that's what was
07:16 - the one I just looked at was called
07:17 - Moira let's let's look at in a different
07:19 - random one at Alice let's try Alice now
07:23 - I don't know if this is right let's see
07:24 - if this is right I don't remember their
07:28 - speech that voice is not a function so
07:32 - it's not voice I should remember this
07:34 - it's set voice I could say set voice
07:36 - Alice clothing today clothing today
07:40 - so there's Alice one of my favorites I
07:42 - think it's called cellos I'm sorry
07:51 - beings are weird I can barely hear that
07:55 - voice but it makes me want to do
07:57 - something when I hear it the cellos um
07:59 - so let's just do something one thing I
08:01 - could emphasize here is if these are the
08:03 - voices I could say let voices equal
08:07 - speech dot voices then I could say let
08:11 - voice equal random voices so the random
08:15 - function in p5 will pick a random
08:17 - element from the array and I could do
08:19 - set voice I could probably actually just
08:20 - say set voice the voice or set
08:22 - voiced/unvoiced name let's see if it
08:24 - works with just that voice object so I'm
08:26 - gonna say console.log voice name so now
08:30 - we'll get a random on each time coding
08:34 - train coding train coding train no
08:37 - coding train it's the same voice so I
08:39 - think we might actually have to say set
08:41 - voice voice name calling train good in
08:50 - plane
08:52 - loading things so now you can hear all
08:55 - the different speech though all the
08:56 - different voices I'm not going through
08:58 - all them but I'm just picking a random
08:59 - one each time alright what are some
09:01 - other things you might want to do well
09:04 - let me add a canvas here this is
09:06 - something that's really useful create
09:07 - canvas let's say 400 comma 100 and what
09:12 - I want to do is I want to display some
09:14 - information like I want to animate
09:16 - something when this when the browser is
09:18 - speaking and not animate when it's not
09:20 - speaking so there are some callbacks if
09:23 - I could just remember what they are
09:24 - speech dot start did maybe start
09:31 - speaking and speech dot ended and ended
09:38 - and speaking I think these are so this
09:41 - is just like with the Dom library if
09:43 - we've used the p5 Dom library where you
09:46 - have like a slider or a button and if
09:47 - you have a callback that you assigned if
09:49 - you press on the button or if you move
09:51 - the slider I'm now assigning a callback
09:53 - and I might have gotten these names
09:54 - wrong I'm going to fix them if I got
09:56 - them wrong but I'm assigning a callback
09:58 - to when when the browser starts speaking
10:01 - and when it ends speaking and so this
10:02 - means I need to write these functions so
10:04 - I could say start speaking background
10:08 - green and then function and speaking
10:13 - that and this is I'm not doing anything
10:15 - sophisticated in terms of the draw loop
10:17 - or any animation but you could imagine
10:18 - doing something background 0 and let's
10:21 - say background zero when it starts so
10:24 - now if I load the page building frame oh
10:27 - yeah it's working I have this whatever
10:36 - so that canvas turns green whenever the
10:40 - voice is speaking so that's a useful
10:41 - thing you can do and the other thing you
10:43 - can do which is kind of nice is you can
10:45 - change three things the rate the pitch
10:50 - and the volume and I believe so I
10:56 - believe it's like set volume so if I
10:58 - made it like point one it should be very
11:00 - quiet set rate so let's let's actually
11:05 - let's just so
11:06 - volume you can imagine I believe the
11:07 - range is between zero and one it might
11:09 - be something else but we could look that
11:11 - up or experiment with it but let's
11:12 - forget about the volume for a second
11:14 - because I want you to be able to hear it
11:15 - let's try it set rate and what I'm gonna
11:18 - do now is not give it a random voice
11:20 - anymore because I want it to be able to
11:22 - recognize what it's doing so let's take
11:24 - out the set voice so it's gonna be the
11:26 - default voice now whoops
11:29 - set rate is not a function set rate is
11:32 - not sorry I'm my naming is a bit
11:35 - confusing set rate is something that you
11:37 - assign to the speech object itself the
11:40 - voice is the you know each voice doesn't
11:42 - have its own great it's the rate that
11:44 - it's currently gonna speak with that
11:45 - voice so I'm just doing this wrong
11:47 - because I this should be speech dot set
11:49 - rate Tony crane Tony crane so you hear
11:53 - that twice as fast right and if I were
11:54 - to say 0.5 coding train coding train
12:01 - it's much slower and then I could also I
12:03 - can also say speech dot set pitch I
12:06 - don't know what the range is for this I
12:08 - should I'm gonna just say five just to
12:09 - see anyway so you get the idea let's put
12:22 - this the rate back to one and put the
12:24 - pitch to like zero point two coding
12:27 - training coding training Oh coding
12:32 - training so I think what's happening
12:34 - here is this particular voice it's sort
12:36 - of hard to pick up the lower pitch so
12:38 - one thing I could do is just try let's
12:42 - assign a specific voice let's try that
12:45 - voice Alice and let's listen to that
12:50 - what's on the wrong and let's listen to
12:53 - that today coding and now let me set the
12:59 - pitch to lower good evening yeah this
13:03 - voice you can hear it a bit it's a bit
13:05 - more obvious just with this voice that's
13:08 - higher I have another example that I
13:11 - will link to as well which just has a
13:14 - bit more so this is an example I'm not
13:16 - gonna go through coding all this but as
13:17 - an
13:17 - sighs this might be something you try
13:19 - this is an example that takes all of
13:21 - those voice names and puts them in a
13:23 - drop-down menu so I could pick bells I
13:28 - can you know I can change the rate I can
13:36 - change the pitch this one is a weird one
13:43 - it's catching up I press the button to
13:46 - anytime so the queue of it speaking I
13:47 - kind of so anyway so I encourage you to
13:49 - check out the code that drives this
13:51 - particular demo there's some other
13:53 - examples that are part of the p5.js
13:55 - github repository I mean p5.js speech
13:57 - get a repository as well so see what you
13:59 - can make make something that talks to
14:01 - you in the browser and let me know how
14:03 - it is in the next video I'm going to do
14:04 - is have the browser listen to what I'm
14:06 - saying and print out in the browser
14:09 - itself what I'm saying okay so this was
14:13 - text-to-speech right and I want to do
14:15 - speech to text in the next video thanks
14:17 - for watching
14:22 - [Music]
