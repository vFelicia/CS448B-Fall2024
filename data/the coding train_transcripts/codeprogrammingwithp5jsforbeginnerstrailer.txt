00:01 - Hello, and welcome to
Code, exclamation point.
00:04 - This is a online set
of videos where I--
00:08 - my name is Dan, last
name Schiffman--
00:11 - I am here to teach the
basics, the fundamentals
00:14 - of programming.
00:14 - This is a course
for total beginners
00:17 - who have never tried
programming before.
00:19 - I'm going to use the
programming language JavaScript.
00:21 - I'm going to show you how
to code in JavaScript.
00:23 - I'm going to use a JavaScript
library called p5.js which
00:26 - is like big heart to p5.js.
00:28 - It's a library that has
a lot of functionality
00:31 - for a bunch of things, but
notably, drawing and animation
00:35 - and interactivity.
00:36 - So I don't know what you're
going to make, but by the end,
00:38 - might make a game, an art
project, science experiment,
00:41 - a performance.
00:42 - I don't know what
you're going to make,
00:43 - but I can't even imagine it,
and I'm excited to find out.
00:46 - So come with me, all aboard
on the coding train to learn
00:49 - the basics, Code!
00:51 - JavaScript with p5.js.
