01:40 - approximately one minute
01:42 - and six seconds let me know in the chat
01:44 - if you can hear the audio just fine this
01:46 - is
01:47 - not your usual coding live stream
01:50 - tonight this is a
01:51 - broadcast of the itp ima
01:55 - lo-res at nyu tisch school of the arts
01:58 - spring 2021 show so i'll explain more
02:00 - about that once i get started
02:13 - [Music]
02:52 - sorry about that one more minute until i
02:55 - get started one more song here to play
03:04 - [Music]
03:16 - do
03:19 - [Music]
03:44 - do
03:47 - [Music]
03:54 - hello and happy tuesday evening
03:57 - i'm here at my desk prepare to broadcast
04:01 - the news no
04:02 - not the news i'm actually here to
04:04 - broadcast the itp
04:06 - ima low res spring show
04:09 - of 2021 a festival of the recently
04:13 - possible now
04:15 - here's the thing typically
04:18 - um in the past if you've ever seen one
04:21 - of my
04:22 - biannual it's biannual twice a year or
04:24 - every other year
04:25 - you let me know in the chat but twice a
04:28 - year i will broadcast
04:30 - uh the show of the wonderful students
04:33 - from the itp
04:34 - ima and now low res program at tisch
04:36 - school of the arts new york university
04:38 - located right here where i
04:39 - am sitting in brooklyn new york
04:41 - typically this is a live
04:43 - in-person show and i'm wandering around
04:44 - with a mobile camera trying to
04:47 - somehow like do all of my internet wi-fi
04:50 - dances properly so that the stream can
04:52 - broadcast
04:54 - but um here we are once again uh now i
04:56 - think this is the third time
04:59 - that the itp ima lores show is
05:04 - online but it's pretty different today
05:07 - so
05:08 - what i'm doing right now is is kind of
05:10 - in some sense useless
05:12 - because what i really would much prefer
05:15 - that you do i would you know
05:16 - you're not supposed to say this when
05:18 - you're live streaming or making a video
05:19 - but turn this off
05:21 - and go and to
05:24 - and join the show yourself so i need to
05:26 - figure out um
05:28 - i'm going i think if i take this link no
05:30 - i'm in the wrong place ah
05:32 - no i'm good no wrong yes i think i can
05:34 - do this
05:36 - sorry i'm about to put into the chat um
05:40 - and hopefully you're not gonna hear this
05:42 - good i'm about to paste into the chat
05:44 - the link to the show itself i'm typing
05:48 - this now
05:49 - you're actually seeing this
05:52 - like way before you're gonna hear me say
05:54 - this because of the way the delay is i
05:56 - don't know what's the future what's the
05:58 - past
05:58 - but that's the actual link that you can
06:00 - go and join the show
06:02 - yourself i'm actually going to also edit
06:04 - the video
06:07 - and just go to the video description and
06:10 - paste the link now
06:12 - in the video description i'm going to
06:13 - hit save
06:15 - so if you were to refresh the page that
06:18 - you're on um
06:20 - in addition to seeing the link in the
06:21 - chat um
06:23 - and i don't know youtube is like yelling
06:25 - at me like it's not
06:26 - it's got an error but let's see if this
06:28 - worked yes so now in this video's
06:31 - description
06:32 - is the link to the actual show itself so
06:35 - in just a moment
06:36 - i'm going to go in there myself
06:39 - and show you how it all works where you
06:42 - can find the project where you can chat
06:44 - with the creators of the project
06:45 - then i will continue to stream and
06:47 - wander around but you could
06:48 - experience this stream in your own way
06:51 - just by being in the show itself i'm
06:53 - just
06:53 - checking out the chat um saying hello to
06:56 - tom
06:57 - g who says hello saying hello to wucha
06:59 - and thomas
07:00 - smith and gregor biennial versus
07:05 - biannual
07:06 - biennial like the venice biennale is
07:09 - every two years
07:10 - by annual every six months i really hope
07:14 - i can remember that
07:15 - in the future because i would love to be
07:17 - able to
07:18 - call upon that knowledge when needed
07:20 - because i
07:21 - is there an equivalent for bi-weekly
07:24 - is there by weekly
07:28 - by bi-monthly by i don't know
07:31 - carson is here hey all right so um let's
07:35 - throw caution to the wind
07:37 - and just get started with what um i
07:40 - don't know i don't have a lot of other
07:41 - stuff to say i could talk about
07:43 - you know coding train news and updates
07:45 - there will be a regularly scheduled live
07:47 - stream
07:47 - this thursday but i'm going to switch
07:49 - over here and
07:51 - i am now uh in uh
07:54 - spatial chat itself so uh if you might
07:57 - remember that last time i live streamed
07:59 - a
07:59 - uh online version of the itbiamalorez
08:01 - show we were using something called
08:03 - yorb um without by accident going into
08:08 - oh wait i can hear somebody
08:11 - i thought the oh oh
08:15 - oh oh i thought that the microphones
08:18 - were disabled in this room
08:20 - but i guess if you're a host it's not
08:23 - i've i've stopped i've muted the audio
08:26 - so you can't hear it i gotta go i gotta
08:28 - i gotta go to a different welcome room
08:30 - this is too destructive wait no i can do
08:31 - this
08:32 - great all right here we are yorb
08:35 - was a 3d world created by
08:38 - um a bunch of developers and artists and
08:42 - students and
08:43 - researchers at the itb program itself
08:45 - spatial chat
08:46 - from what i understand is a third party
08:49 - commercial system
08:50 - i think there's a way to use it for free
08:52 - but let's see if i can kind of like walk
08:54 - you through
08:55 - how spatial chat works
08:58 - so basically the way that it works is
09:01 - and you can see here this is um
09:03 - there's a whole bunch of rooms and soon
09:04 - i'm gonna start going into the rooms
09:06 - to view the various projects but we can
09:09 - look here
09:10 - and sort of see um how it works so audio
09:12 - and video is spatial so this is me right
09:14 - now
09:15 - i can move myself around notice how
09:17 - these other circles get larger and
09:19 - smaller
09:20 - if we were in a room where the audio and
09:22 - video was not disabled
09:24 - then we would see the video appear as we
09:26 - got closer and disappear as we got
09:28 - further
09:28 - the audio would get louder and quieter
09:30 - depending on our distance
09:32 - um the other thing we can note here is
09:35 - that each room has a theme
09:37 - six projects in each room each project
09:39 - has their own area labeled with the name
09:41 - and project title
09:42 - so this is what it's going to look like
09:44 - i wonder if i can zoom in any further on
09:46 - this
09:46 - i can do my own zoom so we're going to
09:48 - start to move around and find
09:50 - projects and there'll be videos being
09:52 - shared and there's the creators of the
09:53 - project will be there that i can
09:54 - interview and ask some questions
09:56 - um um you can see here you if you
10:00 - if you join right here's the url once
10:01 - again it's in the chat
10:03 - and i don't think i pinned it let me pin
10:05 - it in the chat
10:07 - and replace the pin message so now
10:08 - that's pinned
10:10 - you can find the url right there is
10:12 - anybody watching right now are any of
10:14 - you
10:15 - in welcome room a are these any of your
10:18 - circles floating around
10:20 - i would be excited and hello to grant
10:23 - from utah utah the time zone that this
10:26 - is meant for perhaps because i know
10:29 - a lot of the viewers that regular
10:30 - viewers of the coding train or in
10:32 - europe or asia and other parts of the
10:35 - world
10:36 - and plenty of other uh places that just
10:38 - are it's you know the middle of the
10:39 - night are quite late right now so
10:41 - thank you to anyone who happens to be
10:42 - tuning in let's see what else we can
10:44 - find out help and map
10:46 - um navigate the directory uh and desk
10:48 - for the project map you will also find
10:50 - helpers
10:51 - if you have questions or need support by
10:52 - the way
10:54 - uh let's see how many people do i have
10:56 - um vicky lou
10:57 - says that they are there let's see if we
10:59 - can find vicky this is where i am oh no
11:01 - no wait this is where i am
11:03 - vicki come over near here and let's see
11:06 - your icon now of course once i actually
11:08 - start guarding the rooms with audio and
11:09 - video i might not be so encouraging of
11:11 - you
11:12 - to come and interrupt but yeah you
11:14 - should you should come and say i'm just
11:15 - slightly afraid of the live broadcast
11:18 - aspect of doing this
11:20 - um is anybody from itp ima or lores
11:23 - watching this right now
11:24 - if you are say hi in the chat but really
11:26 - come on go into the spatial chat
11:28 - so i've been told that there's a limit
11:30 - of 500 people on the spatial chat
11:32 - and i um i kind of have a personal
11:35 - mission to see if we can
11:36 - get it above 500. i can see right now
11:39 - there are 89 people watching this
11:42 - stream or um which is um
11:45 - a wonderful amazing number of people if
11:48 - i'm being honest but also a little bit
11:49 - lower than
11:50 - i usually will have for a live stream
11:52 - probably the time
11:53 - uh is a little bit of a barrier there
11:55 - for a lot of people but
11:56 - um wessie is there um and maybe this is
11:59 - oh that's wesley
12:01 - um and i i don't know where did i go
12:04 - here i am
12:04 - so all right so let's go we're now in
12:06 - welcome room hey i gotta ease my way in
12:08 - i mean welcome room a i'm gonna ease my
12:11 - way in
12:13 - and um uh yes and i see also just
12:17 - just to respond to carson in the chat
12:19 - who writes i really
12:21 - should be doing college right now what
12:22 - does it mean to do college by the way i
12:24 - would like to do
12:25 - college that sounds like fun i did i did
12:27 - college once upon a time many moons ago
12:30 - oh boy i'm old okay i really should be
12:33 - doing college right now but maybe i
12:34 - could watch your streams more during the
12:35 - summer
12:36 - yes first of all take care of yourself
12:39 - take care of your own well-being drink
12:42 - water
12:43 - rest take care of your work study be
12:46 - with your friends and family and loved
12:47 - ones
12:48 - and then if you happen to have a little
12:50 - bit of extra time left over you could
12:52 - join a coding train stream
12:53 - that's what i would say that should be
12:54 - your priority list um
12:56 - and algeria is in the house zach from
12:59 - algeria
13:00 - and uh christopher chenier all right
13:02 - we're getting some announcements
13:04 - actually
13:04 - let's tune into these announcements
13:08 - the the projects in those rooms i
13:10 - believe there's
13:11 - just a little bit of a check of the
13:13 - audio do you hear both
13:14 - of the announcements that's going on and
13:16 - me and then to navigate you can actually
13:19 - move your bubble around
13:22 - um the closer you get to somebody the
13:24 - louder
13:25 - the sound is it's almost as if i'm
13:27 - actually sitting in these seats
13:28 - um and then you can also move this if
13:32 - you click on the background
13:44 - marvel give me a call look at these
13:46 - special effects i've got going and if
13:48 - you want to unmute if you have any
13:49 - questions feel free to unmute yourself
13:51 - as well
13:54 - okay we're going to welcome room b right
13:56 - now and i'm going to mute the
13:58 - spatial uh chat audio all right when
14:01 - welcome room b oh i guess the welcome
14:03 - rooms all have the same thing
14:05 - welcome room c i somehow i imagine the
14:07 - welcome rooms had different images
14:09 - um so okay maybe
14:12 - maybe just maybe we're ready
14:16 - to go into directory
14:19 - and info desk
14:23 - oh i played a sound effect and you
14:24 - didn't hear it okay let's try this again
14:26 - maybe just maybe i feel
14:30 - ready everyone oh oh we've got more now
14:32 - to the show
14:35 - you're looking if you're a little
14:36 - confused on how to navigate let me go
14:38 - back to this room okay hold on
14:40 - welcome roommate okay inside the column
14:43 - all right let me welcome room b
14:44 - now maybe come on i have a bit to do
14:47 - here
14:48 - maybe we feel ready now to go into the
14:51 - directory
14:52 - and info desk right shall we do it
14:58 - what do you all think what do you think
15:02 - what do you think all right i'm going to
15:04 - mute the audio
15:06 - of i'm like very afraid oh wait
15:09 - look i everybody knows
15:12 - i just i don't love the idea of like
15:15 - broadcasting
15:16 - this space without people's consent and
15:19 - so
15:20 - um you know i'm going to be very mindful
15:22 - of that i mean this is a public
15:24 - online space so people are hopefully
15:27 - just generally aware that they are being
15:29 - watched and could be recorded but the
15:31 - students are aware that i'm going to be
15:32 - visiting their project
15:34 - and i've also prepared a sign to appear
15:36 - on my face that says live broadcast
15:38 - so here we go uh twirling
15:42 - tech goddess is in the house and i
15:45 - really
15:46 - there's just no way that you could
15:48 - possibly be referring to my hair
15:51 - i don't think any i'm just gonna
15:55 - got to be somebody else right because i
15:57 - know it's getting a little bit
15:58 - long and i've got my little streak of
16:00 - gray and eventually
16:01 - hopefully if it stays it will be all
16:03 - silver at some point and
16:05 - i'm very excited for those days if i'm
16:06 - still a person who's doing things on
16:08 - youtube
16:10 - you will appreciate this twirling tech
16:11 - god goddess because my t-shirt says
16:13 - don't hate
16:15 - wait hold i gotta go to this view don't
16:17 - hate
16:18 - roller skate all right
16:21 - um where am i here i am all right now
16:24 - we're going into the directory and info
16:27 - desk it's like 8 15 i haven't looked at
16:28 - a project yet
16:30 - okay uh here we go directory and info
16:33 - desk
16:34 - here we are i'm going to turn on my
16:36 - camera
16:38 - here i am i'm going to go to the corner
16:40 - just for a second to be
16:41 - by myself i'm turning on my mic and then
16:44 - i'm going to zoom in
16:46 - and this is me see this is my now
16:49 - i'm seeing it mirrored because um
16:52 - spatial chat wants to show me my image
16:55 - mirrored which makes a lot of sense
16:56 - by the way this camera that you're
16:58 - seeing here right now is the different
17:00 - than this camera right like i can cover
17:01 - my camera
17:02 - the camera that's in spatial chat is the
17:04 - camera that's on my
17:06 - laptop but where i'm broadcasting this
17:08 - from open broadcast studio is
17:10 - this camera over there hi this camera
17:12 - over there
17:14 - camera one i only have one camera
17:16 - someday i'll have more than one camera
17:18 - so i can do the bit where i go
17:19 - camera two come on let's talk we gotta
17:22 - talk
17:22 - camera two but there's there's no camera
17:24 - two right now so i can't do that
17:26 - all right back to here so i think i can
17:28 - remove myself
17:30 - as i move around because this is me
17:32 - right here i am the live broadcast
17:35 - um and now we're in um let's see let's
17:38 - go uh
17:38 - let's go like if you have social anxiety
17:42 - this is really
17:43 - like i don't know if live streaming to
17:45 - the internet and weirdly it's like
17:47 - easier for me to do that than
17:49 - uh walk into a room full of people but
17:51 - um
17:52 - uh let's go wander over and say hi to
17:54 - some folks
17:56 - oh hello i'm a live broadcast
18:00 - everybody be careful hi hello
18:03 - well hello shipping oh this is the let's
18:05 - see is the audio the audio is going
18:07 - through
18:07 - to my live broadcast i've got my sign
18:10 - that says i'm a live broadcast
18:12 - so everybody knows everybody's okay
18:15 - we've got a chat going
18:17 - mostly people are joining the live
18:19 - broadcast and then i'm steering them
18:20 - here so if you are watching
18:22 - the live broadcast right now here is
18:24 - your link right here on the screen
18:27 - chat slash s slash spring show 2021
18:31 - you could jump right in here and invade
18:33 - the live broadcast
18:35 - you know be kind
18:39 - uh how's everybody doing tonight this is
18:41 - like such a nice crew of folks
18:43 - i'm i'm i'm having like a just a very
18:46 - small
18:47 - minor fit of anxiety and panic here but
18:49 - it's everything
18:52 - as we circle you
18:56 - is there anything we can do to help no
18:58 - no no that's my
18:59 - that's my uh uh baseline so things are
19:02 - actually quite good
19:03 - um and i'm i'm okay and um i'm
19:07 - i'm slow like for a while i just spent
19:09 - the time in the welcome rooms
19:10 - where you couldn't um speak or hear
19:14 - other people
19:15 - and then now we changed that yeah oh oh
19:18 - that was nice though it was a good way
19:19 - to ease into spatial chat
19:21 - so now i'm in the directory room and i
19:24 - i'm working up the courage
19:26 - to go to i think my first stop is going
19:28 - to be
19:29 - virtual reality
19:32 - you're brave dan you're so brave have
19:35 - fun
19:36 - thank you all right everyone
19:39 - i'm going to go over here so they don't
19:41 - have to hear me um
19:43 - i am now going ahead let's go look we're
19:46 - going to head over to
19:47 - vr where there are these um let's see
19:50 - how far can i zoom
19:52 - in um we're there and i
19:55 - i was meaning not to show people's names
19:56 - here um we're gonna head over to vr
19:59 - where we have these one two oh i'm
20:01 - pointing the wrong way
20:03 - i'm looking the whole reason why i don't
20:04 - have my video flipped
20:06 - is because i can look i guess i could go
20:08 - over here here we go this is very
20:09 - obviously this is like making all the
20:11 - difference in your viewing experience
20:13 - must point correctly uh ah
20:17 - julia ann myers is in the vr room i
20:20 - think the last time i think i've
20:21 - interacted with julia before but julia
20:23 - you are a low-res student at the itp ima
20:26 - lores
20:27 - program so many names and acronyms what
20:29 - does it all mean
20:31 - ask in the chat i'm happy to try to
20:32 - answer that um
20:34 - julia cyberspace three julia if it's all
20:37 - right with you
20:38 - let's head over to your project first
20:40 - because um
20:41 - yeah why not okay we're heading over to
20:43 - julia's project
20:45 - um so i'm going to the vr room
20:49 - and now i am i just got plopped in
20:52 - what is history it's many parallel
20:54 - streams of events
20:55 - which meet at certain points so why not
20:58 - create them as parallel structures that
21:00 - makes it easier to write easy
21:02 - to read so to me the computer was an
21:05 - opportunity to radically redefine
21:07 - the nature of writing this is a really
21:09 - cool movie
21:10 - okay can you hear me yeah i'm not sure
21:13 - if we're allowed to talk
21:15 - i got so much audio going on um
21:18 - yeah let me give you a little demo so
21:19 - this is a video in the middle but i'm
21:21 - going to open up this screen here
21:23 - um because this is the actual live demo
21:26 - and so you can visit the site so i've
21:27 - gotten basically last time you stream me
21:29 - my a-frame skills were
21:31 - very rudimentary um this is all a-frame
21:34 - this is uh
21:35 - yeah print out some more features so
21:38 - a-frame is a programming language
21:41 - yeah so a-frame is for writing or
21:42 - creating vr uh do you know 3js
21:45 - like the javascript library so it
21:48 - basically uses that library so you can
21:50 - create like a frame which is a
21:52 - like vr in the browser so like right now
21:54 - what you can see here
21:59 - okay so this is running in the browser
22:02 - right now so you can actually use this
22:03 - with
22:04 - uh a headset an oculus headset or just
22:06 - in the browser
22:08 - and um yeah so basically this time i
22:10 - experimented with like interaction
22:12 - and it's exploration of like pixels and
22:14 - screens and space and all that
22:17 - um so yeah it was really fun um
22:21 - i did a lot of work in after effects and
22:23 - a lot of this all this is is
22:24 - an a-frame though um again the loading
22:27 - times down was
22:28 - a miracle i'm getting some questions
22:31 - from some folks
22:32 - about what is a-frame could you could
22:34 - you give a quick
22:35 - like um high-level uh
22:38 - uh explanation of what a-frame is yeah
22:41 - sure so a-frame uh basically allows you
22:43 - to
22:44 - host vr in the browser so for a lot of
22:47 - your projects you have to have like an
22:48 - oculus or a headset
22:49 - and for this it makes a lot more
22:51 - accessible so anyone can like open up
22:53 - their browser even on your phone and
22:55 - stuff and like this is running yeah
22:57 - right now in chrome chrome is
22:58 - recommended
22:59 - um and you can have a whole vr project
23:01 - there and there's a lot of really cool
23:03 - uses for it
23:04 - um because you can basically have this
23:05 - kind of like 360
23:07 - ability to create in 360 for the web
23:10 - which i think is very cool
23:11 - um yeah and it so it works on time based
23:14 - so it's timed out in javascript so after
23:16 - like 30 seconds
23:17 - each room moves on yeah that's my little
23:19 - project so
23:20 - but a frame is very cool and a lot
23:22 - easier than you'd think it's all in html
23:24 - so
23:24 - um like inside html so i'd recommend
23:30 - oh wow okay so you wait so
23:33 - you make the a-frame is the language
23:36 - powered by 3js
23:37 - in html i i just started i mean
23:41 - just yeah it sounds kind of crazy yeah
23:43 - yeah
23:44 - but basically yeah basically you're
23:45 - working with like entities which are
23:47 - making kind of these 3d
23:48 - objects in a space
23:52 - but it's coded i don't think that
23:54 - they're saying it's like
23:56 - i'm just going to interrupt for a second
23:59 - here
24:00 - um and oh wait a sec uh
24:06 - sorry i meant to mute myself here and i
24:08 - muted myself in the wrong place i'm not
24:10 - interrupting here i'm interrupting
24:11 - someone else
24:13 - cook as you were all good yeah all right
24:16 - go ahead
24:21 - the wrong button again okay now we're
24:23 - all good i
24:24 - i i thought i was doing so well with the
24:26 - technology i've got like
24:28 - audio and multiple computers here and
24:31 - streaming i i just wanted to answer some
24:32 - of the questions in the chat because i
24:34 - think people are all confused about what
24:35 - you're watching
24:36 - so there is at this moment going on in
24:39 - uh in a in a shared space called spatial
24:42 - chat you can go to spatial dot chat
24:44 - s spring show 2021 link in the
24:47 - description and pinned in the chat
24:48 - the end of semester show for the itp ima
24:52 - and lo-res programs at nyu
24:54 - tisch school of the arts just wanted to
24:56 - reset the room here for a moment
24:57 - um julian is asking what does itp and
25:00 - ima stand for
25:02 - so itp stands for interactive
25:04 - telecommunications program it's a
25:05 - two-year master's program
25:07 - and ima stands for interactive media
25:09 - arts which is a a four-year bachelor's
25:12 - of fine arts it's an undergrad program
25:14 - so um hopefully i've linked to those
25:16 - programs in the video's description but
25:18 - if you go to itp.nyu.edu you'll find out
25:20 - there
25:21 - and so ultimately really this is just a
25:23 - a show that you can go and wander around
25:25 - and
25:26 - chat with students and see their
25:27 - projects in a virtual space normally
25:29 - this would be
25:30 - um physically an in-person show in
25:32 - brooklyn new york
25:33 - but um you know here we are
25:36 - in living in 2021 um
25:39 - and a global pandemic so the uh the the
25:42 - show is online for this semester
25:44 - spatial chat is a service that i have
25:47 - nothing to do with
25:48 - that it ima has nothing to do with it's
25:51 - a um
25:52 - like a browser-based multi-user chat
25:56 - video audio spatially oriented
25:59 - system i'm sure we could find out more
26:02 - about it if i looked on their about page
26:04 - um that the department is using for the
26:06 - show all right i'm gonna jump back
26:08 - into the show and listen to what julia
26:11 - is saying
26:14 - yeah and then you just type in the uh
26:17 - the name of my
26:18 - project but you can see it but
26:19 - unfortunately so the interaction i'm
26:21 - adding interaction for oculus controls
26:23 - in like the final version like my thesis
26:25 - is due in july so this is uh like very
26:28 - much a prototype still
26:29 - but so you will be able to interact with
26:31 - the boxes and stuff but you can like
26:32 - click but yeah
26:33 - that'll be final version so okay all
26:36 - right
26:37 - i can't wait i uh i i only you know i
26:39 - can't wait to try this out i'm like oh
26:41 - my gosh i just got in here
26:43 - yeah last night but uh is this going to
26:45 - be available like after 10 o'clock
26:48 - oh the website yeah yeah it will be up
26:50 - okay
26:59 - yeah thanks for stopping by this is
27:01 - great yeah no i'm glad
27:03 - this live broad what's the show called
27:06 - with the rainbows
27:07 - oh the coding train you gotta check it
27:09 - out when you
27:10 - start talking i was like okay it's great
27:13 - no i'm sorry about that i have like
27:15 - a million different controls for like
27:17 - live streams i have the audio
27:20 - from my live stream and i pressed the
27:22 - wrong button but actually julia
27:24 - what i did is actually people were
27:25 - asking a little confusion so i was like
27:27 - resetting the room a bit and i explained
27:29 - what itp and ima are
27:31 - but i didn't really say too much about
27:32 - the low res i don't want to take up too
27:34 - much of your time but
27:35 - yeah could you just talk about what the
27:37 - the low res program for 30 seconds
27:39 - what an electronic document what it's
27:41 - for or what are
27:42 - you know for one thing yeah what it's
27:44 - like for you your own experience
27:46 - yeah for sure yeah it's been really cool
27:48 - so this is like the first year of it so
27:49 - it's a brand new program
27:51 - but i think it's a great way of kind of
27:52 - meeting bridging the gap so it's only
27:54 - one year
27:55 - and you basically do every semester and
27:56 - it's been online from
27:58 - the intention is that you get to
27:59 - experience different campuses
28:02 - and um yeah i love because it's like uh
28:05 - interactive media arts it's also my
28:07 - undergrad major
28:08 - and so i feel like i got so into it
28:09 - that's why i love being able to kind of
28:11 - continue
28:12 - what i was doing and what i was looking
28:13 - into with the uh with the masters but
28:16 - yeah so it's one year
28:17 - i like that's very small you really like
28:19 - have great relationships with professors
28:20 - and all that
28:21 - and um but yeah uh
28:25 - awesome no that's true no no that's
28:26 - perfect that's really helpful
28:28 - yeah yeah and i will um put a link in
28:31 - the
28:32 - youtube chat and uh for people who are
28:34 - interested in finding out more about the
28:36 - program awesome thank you for being the
28:37 - guinea pig this is the first
28:38 - project that i stopped by so i'm gonna
28:40 - go wander around
28:41 - and find some other projects to look at
28:43 - thanks so much yeah have fun
28:45 - thanks for stopping by
28:49 - all right so i'm back to here um and i
28:51 - have someone walking around

28:55 - should be able to move around
28:57 - let's go back in i'm just going to move
29:00 - over here
29:01 - into spatial chat you can't see what i'm
29:03 - doing here i am i'm just moving over
29:05 - here where i don't see a lot of people
29:07 - so i can have a little bit of a break
29:09 - and figure out where i'm going to go
29:11 - next um so i i want to come back to the
29:14 - vr room if i can
29:15 - um because there are more um
29:19 - projects here actually let me see let me
29:21 - see if actually
29:22 - um looks like marianne is there
29:25 - let's see if we can stop by marianne's
29:27 - project um briefly so i'm going to
29:29 - switch
29:30 - to this view i'm going to unmute myself
29:34 - and now i'm going to move back over here
29:37 - and hello is anybody here anybody home
29:40 - hi yes hi how are you oh wait wait wait
29:43 - i
29:43 - messed up my audio buttons okay now i
29:45 - can hear
29:48 - hi dan i'm just saying hello oh yes um
29:50 - so i this is a live broadcast currently
29:52 - i'm mostly encouraging people to leave
29:54 - the live broadcast
29:55 - and enter spatial chat itself but i'm
29:58 - kind of just
29:58 - popping around and visiting projects do
30:00 - you have a minute to tell us about your
30:02 - project marianne sure is the um
30:05 - the trailer playing in the background
30:06 - like distracting oh
30:08 - well i it's not distracting because i
30:10 - don't hear audio from it
30:12 - so it's okay to see it on the screen
30:14 - sure okay
30:15 - um so my project is called root it is
30:19 - a immersive film and also a vr
30:22 - installation looking at race and
30:23 - representation
30:25 - in 3d digital media um it follows
30:28 - a character named yara and she goes
30:30 - through the she does this
30:31 - like hair journey going through these
30:34 - magical hair worlds where she likes
30:36 - and starts off in a straight air force
30:38 - and ends up in a curly hair world and
30:40 - is transformed so that's basically my
30:42 - project
30:44 - awesome and what's the um i'm sorry to
30:47 - ask such a question where
30:48 - because i'm so like such a vr kind of
30:51 - beginner
30:52 - or i don't know beginners maybe even two
30:54 - too strong what is your
30:56 - um is it for a particular platform if
30:58 - somebody wanted to
31:00 - um watch the film or experience it is
31:03 - that something that they can do
31:05 - now or in the future if they want to
31:06 - learn more about it
31:08 - um in the future i'll post it on the
31:10 - project page um
31:12 - i'm going to be taking the summer to
31:13 - actually complete it right now i just
31:15 - have the trailer and the
31:16 - the world setup and some of the the
31:18 - performance capture
31:20 - um ideally it would be an in-person
31:22 - installation where we'd scream the film
31:24 - and then
31:25 - check out the vr piece but i'm
31:26 - definitely going to be working on a
31:27 - web-based version
31:29 - so once that's out i will share that
31:31 - awesome fantastic
31:32 - so if people want to i see this is so
31:34 - kind of amazing by the way i love the
31:36 - way your
31:36 - area is organized and that you filled
31:38 - the chairs with wonderful little emojis
31:41 - which is awesome but i i mean it's i
31:43 - guess i'm speaking the obvious here but
31:45 - um everyone should take a look here you
31:47 - can see um
31:49 - in this pink square over here there's

32:07 - thank you have fun everybody thanks
32:13 - okay here i am oh
32:17 - actually i'm gonna i'm gonna move closer
32:18 - to your trailer because i realize when i

32:21 - so i'm gonna let it play oh yeah
33:50 - please let me know if you guys have any
33:51 - questions
33:57 - i have a little trouble navigating here
34:00 - oh my computer is like
34:01 - all of a sudden grinding to a halt here
34:03 - okay
34:04 - move over here um
34:07 - maybe i should mute myself in spatial
34:10 - chat for a moment so people don't hear
34:11 - me
34:11 - there we go i'm gonna bring myself back
34:13 - here okay
34:15 - so i am going to
34:18 - um move on to my sort of goal is to look
34:22 - at a couple projects on each page
34:24 - i'm gonna move to narrative and
34:26 - storytelling
34:27 - um and see if david is there for his
34:30 - a life's a boat project so here we go
34:34 - i'm clicking on narrative and
34:35 - storytelling oh just to reset the room
34:37 - again
34:38 - anybody's newly joined uh you don't need
34:40 - to be watching me
34:42 - i i appreciate it if you do that's
34:43 - wonderful maybe you maybe you prefer
34:45 - just being able to see somebody kind of
34:47 - wandering around through this show
34:49 - but i highly encourage you to just join
34:51 - yourself um
34:52 - you can just go right to this url in the
34:54 - browser and
34:56 - experience the different projects that
34:57 - are on display in different rooms
35:00 - and uh ask questions and enjoy yourself
35:04 - all right so let me move on to
35:07 - going to the narrative and storytelling
35:09 - uh
35:10 - page and acting with
35:14 - weird mute the spatial chat audio for
35:18 - all of you
35:19 - and let's see where am i i can't find
35:21 - myself
35:29 - what is going on
35:33 - where am i i can't
35:37 - i can't find myself in spatial chat i'm
35:39 - lost
35:40 - i don't exist
35:45 - uh let's see
35:48 - i must be somewhere i'm looking at all
35:51 - these projects
35:53 - my video is on let's see i'm gonna
35:56 - unmute myself
35:57 - i can't find myself is anybody near me
35:59 - to tell me where i am
36:03 - okay what room what project is this
36:07 - i found myself okay
36:12 - oh okay now i've uh hi uh so i'm a live
36:16 - broadcast i mean i'm a person
36:18 - i don't know why my computer has decided
36:20 - that it's just like all
36:21 - was working so well all of a sudden it's
36:23 - you can see my videos basically become
36:25 - incredibly choppy um but um
36:29 - i'm able to hear you and see you just
36:31 - fine so here i am
36:32 - in the project called it's raining could
36:35 - you introduce yourself and tell us about
36:37 - your project if you're okay with doing
36:38 - that yeah sure
36:41 - um welcome um my project call it's
36:43 - raining it's an
36:45 - interactive multi-story line website
36:47 - about
36:48 - a rainy day it was first a digital
36:51 - translation of the real life art piece
36:54 - ring room
36:55 - um but then i got into building this
36:57 - site i add my
36:59 - impressions of rainy days i think
37:00 - they're secretive
37:02 - absurd and mysterious so i build
37:05 - interactions based on
37:06 - those impressions rather than going
37:09 - through a complete story
37:11 - um you will find yourself being in
37:14 - moments that will lead you to other
37:16 - certain moments according to your choice
37:18 - of past
37:20 - um yeah the link is above um feel feel
37:23 - free to visit the site
37:25 - or i can like like demonstrate it i have
37:27 - a screen share here
37:32 - oh let's try the live demo we haven't
37:33 - had a live demo yet i'd love to see how
37:35 - that
37:36 - works okay happy too it's my first time
37:38 - so
37:41 - so you can choose
37:45 - the man or you can choose that you have
37:47 - an umbrella i don't know if you have a
37:49 - preference
37:50 - but if you do please tell me
37:53 - oh it's too much too much of a decision
37:56 - for me i can't i can't handle it
38:00 - maybe um an umbrella then okay you have
38:03 - an umbrella
38:04 - on a rainy day and you're
38:07 - walking um
38:11 - and then there's a dog and a in a house
38:15 - do you want to choose or i can choose it
38:16 - for you no i i can now
38:18 - i can handle it let's go for the dog
38:21 - i'm a dog person nice

39:06 - fascinated by your project but mostly
39:08 - i'm just like so thrilled to see
39:10 - so this is in the way that you're doing
39:12 - this in spatial chat is that
39:14 - you're you've added a screen share that
39:17 - just appears as
39:18 - like any other image or video and then
39:20 - we're able to see it
39:21 - that's amazing and so um if people want
39:23 - to try is
39:24 - try the project themselves um they can

41:20 - thoughtful and helpful
41:21 - person but i don't know you use the word
41:24 - cool there i don't know if i qualify for
41:25 - that that's for sure
41:30 - i don't know man i mean you seem pretty
41:32 - cool to me
41:34 - right off the bat yeah
41:38 - yes you should see his youtube videos
41:40 - like he has a whole youtube channel
41:41 - called the
41:43 - recording train yes we're live on it
41:46 - right now
41:48 - but i teach 3d in photoshop
41:53 - so i'm having a little bit of a 4d an
41:55 - issue where my
41:56 - like browser is just locking up so hold
41:58 - on i'm going to try
41:59 - resetting it and be right back okay
42:04 - uh technical difficulties everyone look
42:07 - at this do you want to see my project
42:08 - then
42:09 - i do but i'm a little worried it's not
42:10 - going to work because everything is
42:12 - frozen so i'm going to come right back
42:18 - page unresponsive okay so i don't know
42:22 - to what extent
42:22 - um obs this is what i i'm running open
42:26 - broadcast studio
42:27 - and i might oh headphone just
42:29 - disconnected
42:30 - um let me try getting back into
42:33 - spatial chat um
42:37 - and this is just the uh coding train
42:39 - discord
42:41 - let's see if everything is kind of going
42:42 - smoothly again all right this is
42:44 - going sorry everybody let's try
42:48 - opening up the browser again
42:51 - i feel like maybe i should quit obs i
42:54 - want to quit obs briefly
42:56 - see if that helps
43:00 - um i'm also going to do something that
43:02 - seems a little bit odd but i'm going to
43:03 - change where my plug is
43:06 - oh my battery is done wow
43:12 - i'm plugged in but like it has no
43:16 - charge why it's just like battery is not
43:18 - charging
43:20 - because it's just like the life is being
43:22 - sucked out of my computer sorry i
43:24 - realized i wasn't even on screen here
43:26 - so let's give this a second okay it's
43:29 - charging again
43:31 - oof that was kind of a disaster
43:35 - i've lowered the brightness doesn't
43:37 - lower for you
43:40 - let's see if i can get back to spatial
43:41 - chat
43:43 - all right let's take here i'm gonna take
43:46 - a short break here
43:47 - and i'm gonna quit chrome i'm gonna quit
43:50 - discord
43:52 - and i'm going to let the um
43:55 - right i'm going to see if my computer
43:57 - can kind of
43:59 - um just gather its strength
44:04 - i don't know what just happened but like
44:07 - the fan is going crazy
44:09 - the battery went to zero even though i'm
44:11 - plugged in which uh
44:12 - is a little bit distressing so i think
44:15 - maybe just somehow running obs
44:17 - and being in spatial chat and all of
44:19 - that really just
44:20 - um i need like an ice pack to put
44:22 - underneath the computer look at this
44:24 - nice
44:24 - see-through little uh sticker here so i
44:27 - don't know if
44:28 - anybody has um any questions you want to
44:31 - ask right now
44:32 - i can put on some like uh waiting music
44:36 - here um
44:39 - oh the music's not gonna play because i
44:40 - have uh oh wait
44:42 - um i've disconnected oh no it is
44:46 - all right hold on everyone
44:50 - let's do the following i'm actually
44:53 - going to just completely shut down the
44:55 - computer
44:57 - and restart it
45:01 - so if you're just tuning in which i
45:03 - don't know that anybody is
45:05 - i am attempting to live stream the itp
45:08 - ima lo-res
45:09 - show um but my computer
45:12 - that i am uh for joining the show the
45:16 - online show from uh which is not the
45:18 - same computer that i'm live streaming
45:20 - from obviously because you can still
45:21 - hear and see me
45:22 - um really just i don't know what
45:24 - happened but it just decided to
45:26 - fall apart so i'm giving it a moment to
45:28 - rest a moment to breathe
45:30 - i could go to maybe i need a little
45:32 - break for myself could go to my little
45:34 - like
45:35 - intermission animation but mostly i'm
45:37 - just kind of
45:38 - talking here vamping so to speak um
45:41 - to like let the computer charge up a
45:43 - little bit
45:44 - and hopefully then kind of reboot it and
45:46 - be all set
45:47 - and fine um vicky asks in the chat why
45:52 - is there nature of code in the video
45:54 - unfortunately i've lost the threat of
45:55 - what that was referring to
45:58 - i've also just now in the last five
46:00 - minutes lost about 15 viewers
46:02 - i hope it's because you've all gone and
46:04 - joined the show yourself
46:06 - uh i'm gonna give let's let's let's take
46:08 - a proper
46:09 - uh i think this is too awkward for oh
46:11 - who built the spatial chat website i got
46:13 - a question
46:14 - i don't know the answer it is not
46:16 - something that i am affiliated with
46:18 - um it is a service that i believe you
46:21 - can use for free and sign up for but i
46:23 - have no
46:24 - personal knowledge or relationship to it
46:26 - whatsoever it just happens that the
46:28 - program chose to use it as a mechanism
46:30 - or means
46:31 - to display all the projects and ronald
46:33 - thank you for your nice message
46:35 - that's good because i'm am i feeling a
46:38 - little like uh
46:41 - hot and sweaty here um having some
46:43 - technical difficulties and just having
46:45 - to
46:45 - um talk silently in a room by myself
46:49 - with these lights i'm in an attic in
46:51 - brooklyn new york
46:52 - with a camera on me um i think how is
46:55 - the doggy ask here and oh thank you for
46:57 - asking so first of all
46:59 - if you don't know i was i have a gloria
47:01 - pickle is my dog
47:02 - she is a six i want me to get gloria up
47:05 - here hey gloria
47:06 - [Music]
47:08 - gloria we'll see if she comes usually
47:11 - she comes and sleeps right next to me
47:13 - if i'm working at this desk or streaming
47:15 - or teaching
47:16 - but gloria is a six-year-old corgi
47:20 - beagle mix
47:22 - she was uh rescued by a
47:25 - um an organization called muddy paws
47:27 - rescue muddy as in
47:29 - i like to jump in muddy puddles um they
47:32 - are based in brooklyn but they rescue
47:34 - dogs
47:34 - i think from kentucky and also perhaps
47:36 - alabama mightypawsrescue.org
47:39 - um and i've also been we've my family
47:42 - has been fostering with them so we had a
47:43 - dog
47:44 - a puppy an eight-week-old puppy named
47:46 - marlon
47:47 - that was his name i was calling him
47:48 - martin so i got confused or marvin
47:50 - depending on how i felt um and we really
47:54 - loved uh having marlin here i have to
47:55 - admit i
47:56 - i wasn't the nicest but i was kind of
47:57 - complaining because having a puppy is a
47:59 - lot it was like a little bit too much
48:00 - for me
48:02 - but my family wonderfully took care of
48:04 - marlin i participated to the extent that
48:06 - i could
48:07 - but marlon was since adopted by a
48:09 - wonderful
48:10 - uh family and uh marlon's gonna have a
48:13 - wonderful life living in upstate new
48:15 - york at a campground
48:16 - so um many many happy returns from
48:19 - marlin i hope to be able to keep in
48:20 - touch
48:20 - the video was the video on the life's
48:22 - about in the spatial chat so the reason
48:24 - why
48:24 - is that particular video is uh david's
48:27 - project is from my class called nature
48:29 - of code
48:30 - so i'm gonna restart my computer you're
48:31 - gonna hear the lovely chime sound in a
48:33 - minute
48:37 - [Music]
48:39 - we're going to hope that everything gets
48:42 - i'm going to blow on it maybe just to
48:43 - cool it off a little bit
48:48 - i think this works this is
48:49 - scientifically known
48:51 - if you go to the apple support website
48:54 - and you talk to the geniuses at the
48:55 - genius bar they will tell you
48:57 - lift up your laptop and blow on it
49:02 - way to cool down a computer also get an
49:03 - ice pack just set it right on top of the
49:05 - ice pack
49:07 - i'm gonna log in now uh poor david is
49:10 - probably waiting for me
49:12 - i am uh rebooting my computer francello
49:15 - wants to know what are your plans for
49:16 - the summer
49:17 - i'm so glad you asked coding train is my
49:20 - plan for summer
49:23 - may is a little bit wonky june is a
49:26 - little bit i'm not so sure
49:28 - july and august i hack i have some plans
49:30 - to be set up in a new
49:32 - studio with a standing desk to be
49:35 - getting back to my roots doing some more
49:37 - coding challenges
49:38 - we'll see if that happens uh but that's
49:41 - that's my plans um you know hopefully
49:43 - i'll have some time to just enjoy with
49:45 - family
49:46 - enjoy being outside um
49:50 - catching up ah the nature of code
49:52 - project i'm working on in collaboration
49:55 - with some folks
49:56 - a brand new coding train website
49:59 - um jiraj asks is the new nature of code
50:02 - playlist completely up now no
50:04 - no not even close in fact all of chapter
50:07 - five has yet to be released it's all
50:09 - been recorded and mostly edited
50:11 - so stay tuned for that i think i
50:12 - probably said this a month ago in the
50:14 - next couple weeks
50:14 - but really it's coming let's see how my
50:17 - uh how the laptop is doing
50:19 - um show percentage i'm at eight percent
50:24 - but as long as it's charging no apps
50:26 - using significant
50:27 - energy so that's a that's good
50:30 - um um
50:34 - and now i'm sorry i'm kind of answering
50:38 - questions and talking and trying to
50:39 - operate my computer at the same time
50:41 - i can show you what i'm doing so i'm i
50:43 - want to go and open up
50:44 - obs um i'm opening up open broadcast
50:49 - studio
50:50 - which should have my camera by the way
50:53 - this is a green screen which i just
50:54 - keyed it to black
50:56 - which is sort of silly with my live
50:58 - broadcast
50:59 - sign uh using significant energy i don't
51:03 - like that
51:04 - stop using significant energy um i need
51:07 - that energy
51:09 - let's go to tools and start virtual
51:12 - camera
51:14 - now we're going to go back into spatial
51:16 - chat
51:18 - coding train live broadcast i'm a live
51:20 - broadcast all that
51:22 - stuff got it continue
51:25 - uh uh no i want to be my
51:31 - my uh headphones disconnected they are
51:34 - now connected
51:36 - so i should be able to go to come on
51:43 - do i need to re let's refresh and see if
51:46 - the mic shows up
51:48 - there we go i am back into these
51:50 - headphones
51:53 - um yeah it's a little bit silly the
51:55 - whole reason i'm using obs
51:57 - is for this you know i wonder if turning
51:59 - off the keying
52:00 - the chroma keying is probably
52:03 - [Music]
52:05 - using a lot of resources so let's turn
52:07 - that off
52:08 - let's just delete it
52:12 - so hopefully that will help
52:15 - and now i just have a green background
52:17 - which is fine
52:18 - so we'll go back into here i'm going to
52:21 - join the
52:21 - space
52:25 - i also need to have loopback audio going
52:31 - um all right here i am i don't know if
52:33 - anybody can hear me
52:35 - i'm going to mute myself in spatial chat
52:40 - and i'm going to mute the spatial chat
52:41 - audio to the live stream
52:43 - uh everyone i'm just here in a welcome
52:46 - room trying to set up a live stream so
52:48 - you're
52:48 - you're welcome to participate and talk
52:50 - or come near me or run away
52:52 - just letting you know that's what's
52:53 - happening um
52:56 - ah great i had a little technical
52:59 - disaster hold on
53:00 - i'm going to send the audio here around
53:03 - the help
53:04 - uh basically if you want to visit any of
53:06 - the rooms there's a list of rooms on the
53:08 - right
53:09 - if you click any of them it'll take you
53:10 - there everything here
53:12 - is spatial yeah uh so if you if i move
53:15 - away from you you won't hear me anymore
53:19 - uh yeah and all the directory room has a
53:22 - map
53:22 - if you want to find out more about any
53:24 - of the projects being shown
53:28 - all right everybody got that explanation
53:30 - uh we're going to go
53:31 - back to narrative and storytelling
53:34 - we're going to try to find david i'm
53:36 - saying online they're
53:38 - just doing something
53:41 - maybe i'll check it out sounds good
53:44 - congratulations david this is this is
53:45 - really great
53:46 - oh thank you so much to louisa oh you're
53:49 - shiffman
53:49 - i'm back yeah so i discovered just in
53:52 - case anyone's wondering i for some
53:54 - reason
53:54 - my um computer plugged in
53:58 - the battery went all the way to zero
54:00 - percent running obs
54:01 - and spacer chat and everything oh my god
54:04 - so i shut it down
54:06 - i lifted it up i blew on it for a while
54:08 - to cool it off which i think is a
54:10 - scientifically proven method and uh
54:13 - i got it to ten percent and it seems to
54:15 - be going okay right now
54:17 - so i'm ready jay we're sorry for keeping
54:19 - you waiting we're i'm ready
54:21 - for uh for this audience that i've got
54:23 - on youtube who by the way should just
54:25 - join spatial chat and come right here in
54:27 - spatial chat
54:28 - itself but uh uh could you introduce
54:31 - yourself and tell us about your project
54:33 - okay so my name is david and i'm a first
54:37 - year itp
54:38 - student i just finished my first year
54:41 - i'm located in queens new york in
54:43 - flushing
54:44 - and like this is a final project i
54:46 - created for the nature of code
54:49 - is the nature of code class it's like a
54:51 - combination
54:52 - my life story my covet life story
54:54 - experience
54:55 - through p5.js and arduino physical
54:58 - computing
55:00 - so this is a video right here
55:03 - and i can i just use the potentiometers
55:06 - to adjust
55:07 - the weather of the ocean scene as seen
55:09 - in this video
55:11 - and i think it came out pretty good and
55:13 - like
55:14 - it's it shows like my personal life
55:16 - story and
55:17 - just explaining to it releasing my
55:20 - stress through the potentiometer you
55:21 - know so
55:23 - it's it's i made this project also
55:25 - metaphorical
55:26 - for both sending to life you know and
55:29 - standing through a storm and through
55:31 - good times and bad times you know so
55:34 - that's it wonderful yeah one of my
55:36 - favorite things about your project david
55:38 - is so you just have some beautiful
55:40 - quotes in there i don't want to spoil
55:42 - them i'll let people
55:44 - experiencing them for themselves but you
55:45 - really have some just delightful quotes
55:47 - and i just think it's also
55:49 - just tremendous work i know how
55:50 - challenging it can be to build your own
55:53 - interface
55:54 - and have it communicate with the browser
55:56 - and the way that you pick the different
55:58 - parameters with some of these
55:59 - algorithmic systems that we looked at in
56:00 - class and were able to develop your own
56:02 - interface for them
56:03 - and tie it into such a personal story is
56:06 - really just terrific wonderful work
56:08 - so um i i think i i'm not i think if i
56:10 - move my
56:11 - um self closer to the video i can hear
56:15 - your audio so i'm gonna do that and let
56:16 - people
56:17 - listen but um if people wanted to watch
56:19 - um use the sketch
56:21 - or watch this particular video
56:23 - themselves i'm assuming these two links
56:25 - that i see right here
56:27 - yes so that's it the first link is a
56:29 - documentation
56:31 - for my former project the second link is
56:35 - a non-pecan version of the sketch
56:37 - so that people can interact with it with
56:39 - the sliders which i replace with the
56:41 - potentiometers for this video or should
56:43 - i say
56:44 - right yeah we talked about that it's
56:45 - such a great thing to do if you work on
56:48 - an interactive p5.js sketch that's like
56:51 - got custom physical installation and
56:53 - hardware um
56:54 - you can have both you can maintain a
56:56 - simultaneous version
56:58 - that works with just browser-based
57:00 - interaction so people can actually
57:01 - experience that interaction themselves
57:03 - and then watch your video documentation
57:05 - to understand
57:06 - um how the hardware and the um gesture
57:09 - based physical
57:10 - interface works so it'd be uh it's too
57:11 - bad this is like such a perfect project
57:13 - for the live
57:14 - itp show i hope that next year and we're
57:17 - back together on the floor sometime
57:18 - you'll be able to bring it in
57:20 - so other other folks can can try it
57:22 - themselves yeah
57:24 - i really want to friendship breakups so
57:26 - i'm gonna i'm i'm kind of like
57:28 - listening in the in the back of my mind
57:30 - here or like just
57:32 - the corner of my ear i don't know what
57:33 - the right expression is for when the
57:34 - video starts but i think it's nearing
57:36 - the end is that right
57:38 - it is yeah yeah so i'm going to try to
57:39 - move myself up and so that we can so i
57:41 - can play it
57:42 - for the stream when it starts over okay
57:44 - perfect
57:45 - better now congratulations david i'm
57:48 - going to go and look around oh thank you
57:50 - so nice to meet you yeah nice to meet
57:52 - you nice to meet you
57:54 - too bye take care looking forward to a
57:56 - much better year
57:58 - and not stormy days anymore all right
58:01 - just i'm moving over here just to reset
58:02 - the room for a minute for anybody who's
58:04 - watching me
58:05 - live this is a oh uh live broadcast
58:08 - of an end of semester show from the itp
58:10 - ima and low res
58:11 - programs at tisch school of the arts nyu
58:13 - and i think the pro
58:14 - i think the video is about to start over
58:16 - is that right
58:18 - yes perfect i'm gonna move up and kind
58:20 - of zoom in on it thank you david
58:23 - when you go towards one side of the life
58:27 - bad things happen to you you go to a
58:29 - dark
58:30 - miserable storm and everything seems
58:32 - very pessimistic
58:38 - you go through happy days and things go
58:41 - very good for you
58:42 - people love you everything goes the way
58:45 - you wanted to
58:47 - and in between you have ups and downs
58:51 - just like any other person does
58:55 - so 2020 was one hell of a year for me
58:58 - i've been through so much throughout the
59:00 - covet pandemic and
59:02 - a lot of people like i know like got the
59:05 - virus
59:06 - and it's been a crazy tough year you
59:09 - know
59:10 - so when the pandemic started my family
59:14 - and i got very sick with covet
59:17 - and we've been to these dark times
59:20 - my mother almost died and my father got
59:22 - very sick
59:24 - i was the most healthiest one during the
59:26 - pandemic
59:28 - and things were very dark for me and
59:31 - just
59:32 - just knowing that wanting for better
59:35 - days to come
59:36 - was just like a far away thing you know
59:42 - but then the pandemic got better
59:45 - my family and i tested negative for
59:47 - coving
59:49 - like things were looking up but it still
59:52 - wasn't the same
59:54 - there were still dark and stormy days
59:58 - i gained the quarantine 15 or should i
60:01 - say
60:02 - quarantine 50 pounds which was a whole
60:04 - lot for me
60:07 - aside from the weight already gained in
60:09 - the past
60:12 - my ticks social god works for my
60:14 - tourette's syndrome because
60:15 - i have tourette's syndrome which is a
60:18 - neurological disorder characterized by
60:21 - inflammatory movements and ticks and
60:24 - these were like horrible days for me
60:28 - like it's just tough to remember it you
60:30 - know
60:31 - so these were the stormy days
60:35 - and suddenly things were kind of rough
60:37 - here and there
60:39 - i also broke up with a lot of friends
60:40 - sorry
60:42 - had some friendship breakups and this
60:45 - thing's happening to me you know like
60:48 - a lot of changes in my life
60:52 - but then the better days were coming in
60:54 - 2021
60:56 - now this year is looking up for me
60:59 - and there's no more storm things are
61:02 - starting to get better now
61:04 - although things are do have its ups and
61:06 - downs still
61:09 - but it's getting better now
61:12 - looking forward to a much better year
61:15 - and
61:16 - not stormy days anymore
61:19 - what a good way to release myself so far
61:23 - just to the turn of a potentiometer knob
61:28 - and one more thing i have to say
61:31 - light's a boat okay not too bad
61:36 - life is like a potentiometer
61:40 - when you go towards one side of the life
61:44 - bad things happen thanks for
61:45 - broadcasting yeah thanks for
61:46 - broadcasting
61:47 - of course all right i'm gonna wander
61:49 - around and head to some other projects
61:53 - take care it's kind of here i am uh
61:55 - really
61:56 - incredible for me to think that it's
61:57 - been a little over 20 years actually if
61:59 - we're talking about the full itp journey
62:01 - my itp journey has been uh
62:05 - rather long
62:08 - i saw myself on the in the video
62:12 - and i had to come over here reload on
62:14 - her screens
62:18 - um can you i'm i'm in the middle i'm
62:20 - kind of like wandering around the show
62:22 - and live broadcasting
62:23 - some of the projects can you give a
62:25 - quick um uh summary of uh just introduce
62:28 - yourself and tell us a few sentences
62:29 - about what it is that you worked on
62:33 - sure yeah so i'm akshita and i'm a first
62:35 - year itp student
62:36 - and my project was a hundred days of
62:39 - journalism for a class called hundred
62:41 - days of making
62:42 - and for the last 100 days i've been
62:44 - interviewing everyone from itp
62:46 - student faculties and staff members and
62:49 - hopefully this project is going to go on
62:51 - in summer and fall as well up to now
62:54 - i've done about 65 interviews
62:56 - and this uh is a compilation of
63:00 - the bits of the first question that i
63:02 - asked in the interview
63:03 - like which is on the screen and if you
63:05 - see the link on the left is the
63:07 - instagram page
63:08 - of uh where i post individual interviews
63:10 - as well
63:13 - amazing i i'm really just always so
63:16 - impressed and in awe of the hundred days
63:19 - projects that i've been following many
63:20 - of them and
63:21 - it's something that i have never tried
63:23 - to do and i certainly
63:25 - aspire to do it especially in the sort
63:27 - of creative coding world
63:28 - there's a lot of people who will do
63:30 - things like daily sketching
63:33 - and i think you know in in the sort of
63:34 - coding sketching sense and i think it's
63:36 - a wonderful practice
63:37 - to adopt to sort of uh you know
63:40 - release yourself in a way of like oh i
63:42 - have to spend like weeks or months or
63:45 - like
63:45 - get everything perfect no just but uh
63:47 - this is such a different kind of project
63:49 - with the
63:50 - with the journalism i imagine it was a
63:51 - tremendous amount of work just to
63:54 - like coordinate how did you manage that
63:58 - so i i think i i sent out google forms
64:00 - for the students and they filled out the
64:02 - google forms and that's how i got to
64:04 - know about their available days and
64:05 - times
64:06 - and for faculty i sent you all emails
64:08 - personally
64:10 - uh to better match um the timings i
64:13 - think the most challenging part was the
64:14 - post-production
64:16 - because uh that took a lot of time
64:18 - honestly especially for the interviews
64:20 - that i took in person on the floor
64:22 - that was literally hard yeah yeah
64:26 - see wonderful well thank you for sharing
64:28 - this so if folks want to um
64:30 - catch all of the interviews they can
64:32 - it's the best places to send them to
64:33 - your instagram page
64:36 - yeah wonderful yeah i'm gonna zoom in on
64:40 - it and show show show everyone all right
64:42 - thanks so much for sharing
64:43 - thank you so much for coming by
64:49 - so here uh i'm gonna mute myself in
64:51 - spatial chat for a second
64:52 - um so here uh i'm gonna bring myself
64:55 - back here
64:56 - uh so here i would encourage you to
64:58 - check out the 100 days of journalism
65:00 - project
65:00 - by akshita and uh you can find
65:04 - her instagram link right there at
65:05 - instagram.com 100 days
65:07 - of journalism okay
65:10 - uh how's everybody doing in the chat
65:12 - people are still here
65:13 - are you you should go too have we hit
65:16 - well how many people are in the actual
65:18 - itp ima
65:20 - spatial chat show can we get it up to
65:22 - 500 people that's my personal goal
65:24 - help me out here share this let's get
65:26 - 500 people into it we could do it
65:30 - um i'm gonna wander through i have a
65:32 - kind of list of projects oh
65:34 - where am i
65:44 - um
65:47 - moving around here layton vignettes
65:52 - let's go check that out yeah yep yep
65:55 - that was right
65:59 - i see mr shipman i think
66:03 - uh i haven't figured out it is hi
66:06 - i have arrived hello
66:09 - i should warn everyone that this is
66:11 - you're being you're being sort of like
66:13 - transmitted across the intertubes right
66:15 - now
66:16 - although mostly i just so used to tom
66:18 - ran away
66:21 - um i heard that and he was like i don't
66:23 - know why that's why i've done
66:24 - this that's the proper that is the only
66:27 - appropriate reaction by the way
66:29 - to uh um so
66:32 - here i am i'm i'm sorry i have like a
66:34 - million buttons to press before i
66:36 - can uh to orient myself let me press
66:38 - this
66:39 - um hi kevin how are you
66:42 - hi i'm great how are you um
66:46 - um i would love for you to uh if you
66:48 - have a minute and don't mind being uh
66:50 - broadcast here to tell us a little bit
66:52 - about this project
66:54 - sure um this is a virtual production
66:57 - short made entirely in unreal engine 4.
67:01 - so um at least at itp there's
67:04 - two kind of like prevailing schools of
67:06 - thoughts or kind of use cases of unreal
67:08 - engine
67:09 - one is uh in game play so using like
67:12 - blueprints or a c
67:13 - plus and kind of like programming
67:14 - environment where the user can go
67:16 - through yourself
67:17 - or um in you know hollywood and the
67:20 - mandalorian i'm sure a lot of people
67:21 - have seen
67:22 - is using unreal engine sequencer um to
67:25 - produce uh you know time-based media uh
67:28 - media production
67:29 - so it's more kind of like a 3d after
67:32 - effects premiere pro type of
67:34 - situation so this is the latter um this
67:36 - is using that
67:37 - and kind of like recording out a bunch
67:39 - of unreal
67:40 - uh sorry uh real-time uh sequences and
67:43 - then
67:44 - uh tied together with match cuts so you
67:46 - know the eye-opening
67:48 - into the subway tunnel the falling
67:50 - versus the rising
67:51 - um the connected with light and then the
67:53 - life and death
67:55 - wow so just to unpack this for a moment
67:59 - um i definitely understand the
68:00 - distinction between
68:02 - using something like unreal engine for
68:04 - an interactive experience a game that
68:06 - somebody might play
68:07 - or for i'm a huge fan of like
68:12 - the mandalorian specifically but just
68:14 - kind of shows that are using a lot of um
68:17 - exciting new techniques and virtual
68:18 - production visual effects but one thing
68:20 - that's
68:20 - never is not entirely clear to me is um
68:23 - the the
68:24 - what's what's actually um you know
68:27 - what's real time versus rendered so for
68:30 - example
68:31 - is the benefit of a lot of what you're
68:33 - doing here is that there isn't that
68:34 - distinction like
68:36 - if you design a scene uh you don't need
68:38 - to like press the render button and wait
68:39 - overnight to see the footage but it
68:41 - actually just
68:42 - happens real time and is there like sort
68:44 - of a uh a quality trade-off there
68:46 - um that's that's one i don't i don't
68:49 - have it's kind of a
68:50 - i'm kind of bouncing around this
68:51 - question without a very well formed
68:53 - thought but that's kind of
68:54 - uh that distinction between real time
68:56 - versus render
68:58 - how does that play a role in your work
69:01 - uh
69:01 - yes um that i think you pretty much got
69:05 - it
69:05 - it's a it's a definitive time trade-off
69:07 - and in you know like media production
69:09 - time is money
69:10 - yeah and also for
69:13 - rendering essentially you know like
69:15 - really good animation studios like pixar
69:17 - dreamworks like they have essentially
69:19 - large render farms like
69:20 - large server rooms just blasting uh like
69:23 - gpu cards
69:24 - at it and real time just you know relies
69:26 - on your local
69:27 - like gpu whatever you have there is a
69:30 - quality trade-off but not much
69:33 - i think that that's the appeal of unreal
69:34 - is right now it's getting to a place
69:37 - where it's much
69:38 - better um and it depends on kind of like
69:42 - what you're using it for maybe it's not
69:45 - you know to the level that people want
69:48 - for pixar
69:49 - like you know like um feature length
69:52 - movies sort of like quality
69:53 - um and a lot of the tools uh that unreal
69:56 - has is getting better and better
69:58 - partially because it's owned by epic
70:00 - games
70:00 - and epic has fortnite so they're able to
70:03 - just buy
70:03 - everyone um the same strategy that apple
70:07 - use essentially you know you have the
70:09 - money you buy all the startups and you
70:10 - get all the tech
70:11 - and you make it free to a certain extent
70:13 - um
70:14 - so it's getting popular more and more
70:16 - popular and then you know thanks to
70:17 - shows like the mandalorian
70:19 - which uh the virtual production there is
70:21 - essentially i don't know if you've seen
70:22 - the behind the scenes yeah the led
70:24 - yeah um it's the time right like you're
70:27 - getting you're able to get posts and vfx
70:30 - into the same room as principal
70:32 - photography
70:33 - or the dp and the director so there's no
70:35 - lag
70:36 - there's no latency between the two and
70:38 - you're able to visualize things on the
70:40 - fly
70:40 - so you don't have to like go back and
70:42 - see oh this didn't come out right let me
70:44 - reshoot it right yeah i was
70:45 - i was watching an interview i think it
70:47 - was with one of the sort of like
70:49 - lighting designer or lighting animators
70:51 - and i i mean by like
70:52 - virtual lighting and they were so
70:55 - excited to work on the mandalorian and
70:57 - the
70:57 - i'm paraphrasing whatever the interview
70:59 - was but it was the first experience
71:01 - where they were actually there on set
71:03 - like doing their work as opposed to it
71:05 - all being sort of after the fact
71:06 - in a different room like by themselves
71:11 - so that was really cool to see i would
71:12 - love um i think it would be really
71:14 - exciting to have
71:15 - a kind of at you know tisch at itp
71:19 - ima to have a kind of mini or virtual
71:22 - volume type set that people could play
71:24 - with and so what um
71:26 - if um like for me like i you know have a
71:28 - lot of experience with certain kinds of
71:29 - digital media and coding and
71:31 - different kinds of graphics but i
71:32 - haven't worked with these kinds of 3d
71:34 - engines
71:34 - what what would be for somebody who's
71:36 - coming from a creative coding world
71:38 - perhaps
71:38 - if they wanted to get into unreal like
71:40 - what what are the
71:42 - what's the starting point what are the
71:44 - skills or or kind of prerequisites in a
71:46 - way before
71:47 - getting started with this kind of work
71:50 - um
71:50 - i would say in my opinion uh most of the
71:53 - creative coding people
71:55 - actually prefer unity a little bit more
71:58 - than on
71:59 - just based on you know you can just get
72:01 - into c-sharp and
72:02 - and modify things uh with code which to
72:05 - me
72:05 - i'm coming from a uh actually like a
72:08 - filmmaking and data science background
72:10 - um so unreal's ui felt much more
72:13 - intuitive
72:14 - and a lot of this sort of controls that
72:16 - we're dealing with right now
72:18 - um is essentially mimicking real-life
72:21 - filmmaking
72:22 - and that's the kind of like um the
72:24 - on-ramp for
72:26 - um you know professional filmmakers to
72:28 - get onto unreal or that's the hope
72:30 - um so uh examples of this
72:33 - are you know the way that the camera
72:34 - glides there's like a virtual crane
72:37 - there's a virtual dolly um you know you
72:39 - can put
72:40 - like lens flares and you can put like
72:42 - different like sort of like dirt maps on
72:44 - there and you can change the focal
72:46 - length and the the
72:47 - um sensor with even though there's no
72:50 - sensor
72:50 - no um but i would say
72:54 - you know uh understand kind of what
72:57 - you're using on real four
72:58 - um it's interesting because
73:02 - it's a game engine but you don't have to
73:04 - use it for games right you're
73:06 - essentially
73:06 - in the real-timeness of it um and the
73:09 - 3dness of it
73:11 - and uh there's a lot of applications to
73:14 - be done there
73:14 - and uh one of the things actually if you
73:18 - uh went to the p-comp room i have
73:20 - another project i did with
73:21 - a collaborator at itp um where we
73:24 - created a physical computing uh camera
73:27 - without any image detection
73:29 - and we would essentially instead have a
73:31 - bunch of environmental sensors
73:33 - and you can grab kind of like snapshots
73:36 - of
73:36 - um the light condition and send it to a
73:39 - server and in unreal i can hook
73:41 - onto that server through http get
73:43 - request and then use
73:44 - that data to drive the lighting
73:46 - condition uh change in the scene
73:50 - awesome wow that's cool i've actually
73:53 - i'm hoping to head by i
73:54 - i'm like i was like oh i'm gonna hit all
73:57 - the rooms and somehow i think i'm only
73:58 - on my third so
74:00 - but um that's awesome to hear and and
74:02 - for anybody who's tuning in like
74:04 - obviously you can just join this spatial
74:05 - chat uh
74:07 - system yourself just by going to the url
74:09 - that's pinned in the video description
74:11 - and in the chat
74:12 - so check out both this project and the
74:14 - other one
74:15 - uh in the p-comp room as well so cool
74:17 - thanks so much for sharing this
74:19 - um it's awesome i'm excited to see where
74:21 - it all leads
74:22 - thank you thank you awesome thanks
74:28 - okay let me head to uh empty welcome
74:31 - room
74:32 - all right i'm in an empty welcome room
74:33 - woof here i am
74:35 - right i'm back in my seat this is my
74:37 - really high-end visual effects
74:40 - i've integrated myself perfectly into
74:42 - this room
74:43 - of watching the show here
74:46 - how's everybody doing there's a few of
74:48 - you still tuning in
74:50 - um ronald is saying that's crazy i never
74:53 - thought about unreal as an animating
74:55 - engine
74:56 - yeah i i don't know like maybe i feel
74:58 - like
74:59 - i was gonna say it's too late for me
75:01 - which is the wrong way to put it but
75:03 - um i i i'm just fascinated by what's
75:06 - happening
75:06 - in animation and virtual production it's
75:09 - it's not really a skill set
75:11 - or that i have um
75:14 - but it's kind of amazing to see
75:17 - um what different students and and
75:20 - creative folks are doing these days and
75:22 - maybe
75:23 - maybe in some small way i can align some
75:26 - ideas or you know i was thinking of
75:27 - learning actually unity or blender
75:29 - um in particular and trying to do some
75:31 - to work with those on the coding train
75:33 - but okay
75:34 - let's move on um i'm running i'm
75:37 - kind of running a a little bit low on
75:39 - steam here i was going to try to go
75:40 - until 9
75:41 - 30 p.m which is very late way past my
75:44 - bedtime
75:44 - it's way past my bedtime let's play this
75:47 - 19 music here
75:50 - oh boy people are hearing me i remember
75:52 - i should mute myself with spacious chat
75:54 - i came here because it was empty uh but
75:57 - uh ah
75:58 - maybe this is a viewer here um you're
76:00 - hearing me probably in both ears now and
76:02 - sort of like with a weird echo delay
76:06 - but i'm going to head over to
76:10 - physical computing and product design
76:13 - and i have
76:13 - my eye and a couple projects um there
76:17 - that i want to check out
76:18 - so oh there's a lot of people in that
76:20 - room i wonder if i should go somewhere
76:22 - that's a little less crowded
76:26 - all right we'll turn this music off
76:30 - um all right so i'm heading over to
76:33 - product design pcomp here we go
76:37 - and i meant to check my only mute myself
76:39 - here
76:40 - bring myself oh i am back i'm gonna i'm
76:42 - gonna just check how's my
76:43 - oh good okay we seem to be the computer
76:46 - seems to be charging again
76:48 - uh which is a very good sign okay so
76:52 - let's find um let me zoom out here
76:58 - let me take myself out there and let's
77:01 - see
77:01 - ah um where did i go where did i end up
77:04 - i'm lost again i zoomed out and i can't
77:07 - find myself is great how did that happen
77:18 - where am i i have to unmute myself oh no
77:20 - i'm down here
77:21 - okay you don't lose it's not as if you
77:25 - need too many they seem to be in the
77:26 - middle of a conversation
77:28 - so let's go uh
77:31 - all right here we are ah okay hold on
77:33 - hello aiden
77:36 - hello how's it going it's going well um
77:39 - i am sorry i'm kind of getting my
77:42 - ducks in a row the wires plugged into
77:44 - the right thing i'm making sure my audio
77:46 - stuff is going so this is by the way
77:48 - it's a live broadcast
77:49 - if you can tell by the uh overlay i got
77:51 - going here
77:52 - um do you have a minute to share um
77:55 - share about your
77:56 - work and project yeah absolutely i'd
77:58 - love to
77:59 - awesome uh take it away whenever you're
78:01 - ready i've got all
78:02 - right plugged in and working sounds
78:05 - great hello everybody
78:06 - um this is my project called infinite
78:08 - reflections and it is the first
78:10 - video infinity mirrors what you're
78:11 - looking at right up here is
78:13 - a real-life video sculpture containing
78:15 - 14 000 leds
78:17 - it is not a render um if you want to
78:19 - scan the hash uh
78:20 - yeah this qr code you can see the videos
78:22 - in hd i'm also going to play them here
78:24 - but
78:24 - we'll see what happens um so just to go
78:26 - over the basics of an infinity mirror
78:28 - you've got a light source in between a
78:29 - regular mirror and a beam splitter so
78:31 - the light bounces back and forth
78:33 - some of it escapes each time and you see
78:34 - uh repetition into the z
78:36 - axis um so last semester so hyland knows
78:39 - that and i created the first
78:40 - video infinity mirror which you can see
78:41 - here um
78:43 - and this is what it looks like in my
78:45 - apartment it is about two feet wide
78:47 - and that's what it looks like when i can
78:49 - start um
78:52 - this semester i kept on going and i
78:55 - created a sphere mirror and convex
78:57 - mirror these are
78:59 - the same inside modular ring but there's
79:02 - different back and front plates so
79:04 - in this case on the left there's speeder
79:06 - mirror which is based on yay kusama's
79:07 - work
79:08 - it's hemispheres on a back mirror that
79:10 - are reflected into spheres and then
79:12 - repeated into the z-axis
79:14 - on the right i'm using a convex smear so
79:17 - that's
79:17 - kind of what you might see at a
79:19 - convenience store to see around the
79:20 - corner it's a bulging lens and that
79:21 - causes the visuals to warp
79:23 - warp inwards um i'll just play this for
79:26 - a couple seconds so we can see
79:27 - um maybe fast forward to here
79:31 - um yeah so if you look closely on any of
79:35 - the individual
79:36 - spheres i don't know if this is
79:37 - glitching out or not but you can
79:38 - actually see
79:39 - all the other spheres floating in space
79:42 - there and the visuals you see
79:44 - happenstance turn out to be exactly what
79:46 - is
79:47 - visible in the same animations on the
79:49 - convex mirror because
79:50 - a hemisphere is a convex mirror as well
79:53 - um
79:54 - so a lot of my work this semester was
79:55 - learning how to use touch designer so
79:57 - that i could create
79:58 - different types of particle simulations
80:00 - and graphics that take advantage of this
80:02 - circular um screen that i built with
80:05 - these
80:05 - mirroring properties so if you move the
80:07 - graphics up and down through the screen
80:09 - it creates a tunnel
80:10 - if you flip them on your side and move
80:12 - them back and forth through the screen
80:13 - it creates this spiraling tunnel effect
80:17 - the next one is the result of moving the
80:20 - visuals one direction through the screen
80:22 - and reflecting the subsequent
80:24 - repetitions
80:25 - um and up until this point i've been
80:27 - using all these mirroring tricks
80:29 - to get rid of the scene that's in the
80:32 - middle because i'm setting a rectangular
80:34 - video to a circular screen
80:36 - um the next one is the first example
80:38 - i've been able to figure out so far
80:39 - of getting rid of the seam and not using
80:41 - any tricks i'm actually programmed in
80:43 - the
80:44 - rules in the asteroids game so the
80:46 - stripes are flying out one side of the
80:48 - screen and then they come in through the
80:49 - other at the same angle
80:51 - both on the top and the bottom uh
80:53 - eventually i'll be rendering in a 3d
80:55 - environment and then mapping it to a
80:56 - cylinder but i haven't gotten that part
80:58 - yet
80:59 - um here's a overview of how everything
81:02 - works but
81:02 - the important things are that there's an
81:04 - app you can control on your phone
81:06 - and you can send live graphics to it
81:08 - over wi-fi
81:09 - so i built a server that's running on my
81:12 - raspberry pi
81:13 - that takes udp messages that i'm sending
81:16 - from my desktop
81:17 - that can basically pull in any siphon
81:19 - stream from any program
81:21 - in a processing sketch and what that
81:23 - allows me to do is create
81:25 - a real-time interactive sculpture
81:28 - so this is called panopti's mirror and
81:30 - it's based on the panopti's uh
81:32 - myth of the hundred-eyed beast that was
81:34 - rewarded for his service for
81:35 - um by having his eyes put on the peacock
81:37 - feathers
81:39 - so this version of the mirror um is the
81:41 - commentary on surveillance capitalism
81:43 - and the ease at which we give our
81:46 - biometric data
81:47 - and privacy information away for a
81:49 - little bit of entertainment so
81:51 - go back to the beginning it attracts you
81:52 - over to these flashy peacock
81:54 - visuals and when you step in front of it
81:56 - it's using open cv eye tracking
81:58 - the camera grabs your eyes they do a
82:01 - real-time mask
82:02 - send them through touch designer and
82:03 - then out over wi-fi
82:05 - to project in real time into the mirror
82:07 - your reward for
82:08 - giving up your eyes is to have your eyes
82:11 - staring back at you so
82:12 - the eyes get switched over from the
82:14 - peacock feathers into this particle
82:15 - simulation
82:17 - um and it gets a little bit overwhelming
82:20 - sometimes and then when you step away
82:23 - uh knows you're no longer in front of it
82:24 - and transitions back into
82:26 - peacock feathers um
82:30 - out of rest a lot of stuff there yeah
82:32 - wow that was uh
82:34 - you must have explained this project
82:35 - before i think you seem to have that
82:37 - totally down um practice a little bit it
82:40 - was my thesis
82:41 - yeah no i don't but so um so this is
82:44 - amazing and people are
82:45 - uh you probably don't see the youtube
82:46 - chat there's a small audience here and
82:48 - people are saying all sorts of nice
82:49 - things including how could i buy this
82:51 - was one of the comments so
82:53 - um actually so that's my first question
82:55 - on instagram yeah first question to you
82:56 - which isn't how can i buy this but uh
82:59 - are the is this just currently in your
83:01 - own
83:02 - space have you installed it anywhere
83:03 - else do you have plans to because to me
83:05 - i i kind of i really have a sense of
83:07 - what it is
83:08 - and i can kind of you know use my
83:12 - mind to sort of like try to imagine
83:15 - uh i mean it's absolutely beautiful
83:16 - seeing the documentation of it you've
83:18 - done a really excellent job
83:20 - uh taking video and and imagery of it
83:23 - that i get a good sense of it but i
83:24 - i can't help but think nothing there's
83:26 - no real replacement for being there
83:28 - with it um so is um and i know obviously
83:32 - there's a lot of
83:33 - you know challenges and restrictions in
83:36 - terms of being able to show work
83:38 - um in the last year and um but as things
83:40 - are now changing and opening up um this
83:42 - is something that
83:42 - do you have plans of where you might
83:44 - install this or uh
83:46 - when can i see it in person that's
83:47 - really my question you can see it
83:48 - tomorrow because it's at the itp floor
83:50 - right now oh it is
83:51 - i put it up in the hallways yeah so it'd
83:53 - be great if you go there at night when
83:55 - it's dark so you don't get the
83:56 - white washing you out behind you um but
83:58 - yeah so it's gonna be at itp for a few
84:00 - weeks
84:00 - um i definitely would love to exhibit it
84:03 - anywhere i could get the opportunity to
84:04 - in the future
84:05 - um and yeah i'm kind of exploring this
84:08 - idea
84:09 - kind of just brush the surface of it but
84:11 - this this idea that you can
84:13 - have a physical sculpture that many
84:14 - people have um but
84:16 - the physical sculptures can have
84:18 - customized digital content on them
84:20 - um this future marketplace of you know
84:23 - all these digital assets that are
84:24 - becoming collectibles
84:25 - i think this could be a great um actual
84:27 - use case instead of just fake uh
84:30 - spinning gifts spinning dollar signs i
84:32 - um
84:33 - i own um a couple one piece that's like
84:36 - from a company called infinite objects
84:38 - which is like um
84:40 - they make it's called you know printable
84:41 - video and so there you know obviously
84:43 - you have a much
84:44 - more highly specialized unique
84:47 - like you know uh display i mean their
84:50 - uh infinite object stuff is is amazing
84:52 - but it's more traditional rectangular
84:54 - video as opposed to
84:55 - this like incredible uh
84:58 - spherical display but yes i think you
85:01 - know to me i love having that
85:03 - and um you know i i can see that that's
85:06 - there's a lot of potential there in
85:08 - thinking about how um
85:10 - how people could you know share their
85:13 - artworks and visuals on this
85:14 - over a network uh um and and that sort
85:17 - of thing um one thing just to quickly
85:18 - add
85:19 - it's so funny like i was uh i was
85:20 - watching a twitch stream about shaders
85:23 - the other day and they were basically
85:25 - making all these radial patterns
85:28 - it's amazing how similar they look but
85:30 - also
85:31 - the discussion i was kind of chiming in
85:33 - on the chat there was about
85:34 - dealing with the seam so it depends a
85:37 - lot on what you're doing but
85:38 - um you know there's a lot of tricks in
85:41 - computer graphics in terms of looking at
85:43 - polar coordinates
85:44 - and saying and like um and um
85:48 - being able to you know people are doing
85:50 - this often with like gif
85:51 - loops and using uh purlin noise or
85:54 - simplex noise these different like noise
85:56 - algorithms
85:56 - to be able to sort of like walk through
85:58 - the numbers in a
86:00 - in a radial space to then tie one end to
86:02 - the other
86:03 - so i'm sure you've explored and thought
86:04 - about some of this stuff but to the
86:06 - extent um that's definitely something
86:07 - that comes
86:08 - up a lot in my own sort of teaching and
86:09 - examples and if there's anything
86:11 - that i can help with there definitely
86:12 - let me know this is it it does like to
86:14 - be
86:14 - used for coding trains that i would love
86:18 - it's a small detail but it's it it can
86:20 - make as i'm sure you've discovered like
86:21 - a huge
86:22 - uh difference it's gonna like take you
86:24 - out of the
86:25 - the sort of absolutely the illusion of
86:27 - what you're experiencing once you see
86:29 - that like ah
86:30 - it's a it's a screen because there's
86:32 - this weird line there
86:33 - so um yeah it's a wonderful amazing work
86:36 - i can't i'm so excited to hear
86:38 - what what is today tuesday yes i'll be
86:40 - on the floor tomorrow not at night but
86:42 - i'll try to be able to be cloudy at some
86:43 - point i can take a look at it
86:45 - take a big poster board and hold it
86:47 - behind your back yeah that's awesome
86:49 - and so if people want to find out more
86:51 - about this the qr code and your website
86:53 - are the best place
86:54 - to send them yeah yep or instagram too
86:57 - yeah it's not updated
86:58 - great awesome thank you so much for
87:01 - sharing
87:02 - thanks so much for stopping by now all
87:03 - right
87:06 - okay i have muted myself
87:10 - i'm coming back here
87:13 - how's everybody doing um i see we have a
87:17 - coding train member
87:18 - adriel oliveira that i um i don't know
87:21 - if you're still watching
87:22 - uh i think you must be newish um if
87:25 - you're a new coding trained member
87:27 - um make sure you check um
87:30 - that find the google form that's like
87:31 - linkedin where you sign up
87:33 - um so that we can be in touch and get
87:34 - you uh onboarded into the discord and
87:36 - all that stuff
87:37 - um let's see um let's let me zoom out
87:41 - here
87:43 - uh oh brandon looks like let me go see i
87:46 - wanted to check out the
87:47 - solar fractal
88:00 - so um i'm listening there's a little bit
88:03 - of a conversation going on that i don't
88:04 - want to interrupt
88:06 - um but um
88:12 - um
88:14 - but uh i'll wait as they wind down and
88:17 - maybe we'll we'll see if brandon can
88:18 - give us a nice explanation of this
88:20 - project
88:27 - yes hi sorry i oh now i i have just
88:30 - unmuted your audio i have a
88:32 - i i i'm getting a little better at my
88:34 - system here this is a live broadcast
88:37 - uh uh it's the the appropriate reaction
88:39 - by the way is to run away go somewhere
88:41 - else if you want
88:42 - um but i'm kind of wandering around here
88:45 - and um checking out some of the projects
88:47 - um this is one that i know well because
88:48 - it just happens to be from a class that
88:51 - i'm involved with
88:53 - i guess is a weird way to put it um so
88:56 - do you have a minute brandon to to give
88:57 - us a quick um
88:58 - to introduce yourself and tell us a bit
89:00 - about this project
89:02 - yeah of course so uh yeah i'm i'm
89:04 - brandon
89:05 - uh i was fortunate to be in the nature
89:07 - of code with dan this semester
89:09 - and uh this project is a
89:12 - solar-powered fractal tree so it's uh
89:15 - you know combining what i was learning
89:17 - in the nature of code with
89:19 - fractal trees and l systems um
89:22 - with an enclosure that's uh an e-paper
89:25 - display
89:26 - that's being run by an arduino so i had
89:29 - to port
89:30 - a bunch of what we were learning in in
89:31 - class to the
89:33 - arduino ide and uh
89:36 - then it's solar-powered so like a a real
89:38 - plant when it's
89:39 - exposed to light uh that'll generate new
89:41 - growth
89:42 - over time
89:46 - amazing and and this is um i have not
89:48 - yet experienced this in person
89:51 - but this is um you have this there's
89:54 - just one of these right now and you have
89:55 - it uh at home with you or do you have
89:57 - plans for thinking about how
89:59 - you might get yeah oh there it is
90:02 - just the one yeah i'd love to figure out
90:06 - how to
90:07 - simplify it a bit um i had a good chat a
90:10 - moment ago with allison parrish and she
90:12 - was
90:13 - pointing out how um yeah like the
90:15 - minimalist aesthetic
90:16 - i think there's some ways right now
90:18 - there's a lipo battery in it that's not
90:20 - necessarily good for the environment i
90:21 - think the whole thing could be
90:23 - trimmed down to maybe run on a capacitor
90:26 - maybe even lower power so yeah there's i
90:29 - want to do a little tweaking to the
90:30 - hardware but
90:31 - uh yeah certainly
90:34 - uh yeah i'd love to make more of these i
90:38 - think uh
90:38 - you know we were of course talking about
90:40 - mutation in class
90:42 - and in my mind uh some next steps for
90:44 - this would be
90:45 - to have the growth continue for the
90:47 - plant so
90:49 - once it kind of reaches an adult stage
90:51 - it could
90:52 - develop seeds and those seeds could have
90:55 - some random mutations to the rules from
90:59 - the l system
91:00 - uh into the next generation so like over
91:02 - time it could evolve
91:04 - so um yeah it's really interesting to
91:07 - see that
91:08 - we i was just looking at um aiden's
91:10 - project and you know on the one hand you
91:12 - think these are completely
91:14 - unrelated different projects this
91:15 - infinity mirror
91:17 - and this you know small e-paper display
91:21 - but they both i think get at something
91:23 - to me that's really
91:25 - exciting about this kind of work which
91:26 - is you know especially in the last year
91:29 - we're all
91:30 - experiencing so much of you know
91:33 - graphics and chat and text and
91:35 - everything through our rectangular
91:37 - traditional
91:37 - very bright computer screens hunched
91:41 - over them
91:42 - and so there's something i think aiden's
91:44 - the infinity mirror is
91:45 - is you know is is very uh like explosive
91:49 - and exciting and dynamic and
91:51 - uh and red bloods but this has this sort
91:53 - of very like quiet and contemplative
91:55 - quality to it
91:56 - but yet it's the same algorithms and
91:58 - kind of graphical systems that
92:00 - i know from that i would see in a p5
92:03 - sketch so i think there's
92:04 - um there's i think there's some
92:06 - something really lovely about that and i
92:07 - agree i think you know
92:08 - my like my family's super into animal
92:11 - crossing
92:12 - which is so much like gardening and
92:14 - plants and stuff like that but i
92:15 - i love this idea of being able to if i
92:17 - had one to have my own
92:19 - you know little l system plant that i
92:20 - could tend to and care to
92:22 - and share with others and what does it
92:24 - mean that how is mine the same or
92:26 - different than yours and i think there's
92:28 - a lot of potential and possibilities
92:29 - there
92:30 - um and i and i and i love you know what
92:33 - yeah the idea that this is um you know
92:34 - solar powered
92:36 - um it has a kind of handmade uh quality
92:39 - to it that i think you know
92:40 - all those pieces like really work
92:41 - together conceptually as um
92:44 - within in one project which is great
92:47 - yeah thank you so much dan i love those
92:49 - thoughts
92:49 - and i think uh slowing down is something
92:53 - i've been thinking
92:54 - a lot about um and there there are other
92:57 - projects too like i
92:58 - i never show the other wall of my room
93:00 - because the zoom is always facing this
93:01 - way
93:02 - but um yeah there's uh this year moon
93:05 - day clock that i've been infatuated with
93:09 - um that similarly like makes you think
93:11 - about time on a different scale yeah
93:13 - and uh yeah i love i love that this
93:15 - project too can be
93:16 - yeah using so many new technologies but
93:18 - still um
93:20 - kind of make me slow down and and think
93:22 - about time on a different scale
93:24 - yeah wonderful awesome and so if people
93:26 - want to find out more
93:27 - and hopefully you know sign up for your
93:30 - eventual um
93:31 - crowdfunding uh campaign to produce
93:35 - millions of these
93:36 - um where should where should they go i
93:39 - guess the link's right here
93:40 - is the page yeah yeah so my name
93:42 - brandonroots.com i
93:43 - mean i'll post links there eventually uh
93:46 - or you can follow me on
93:47 - instagram be roots but yeah there's a
93:50 - link here
93:51 - for uh the blog posts showing up awesome
93:54 - thank you so much for sharing great work
93:56 - congratulations thank you dan
93:58 - yeah it's great seeing you thank you
94:02 - okay i'm moving along here let me i
94:04 - muted myself
94:07 - i'm gonna go to a welcome room here
94:13 - okay here i am ah the quiet space of the
94:16 - welcome room oh we got the coding
94:18 - train live broadcast with us again yeah
94:20 - but the
94:21 - welcome room is my place to go and like
94:23 - take a beat take a breath oh i pressed
94:25 - the wrong button
94:26 - uh like but because at one point i think
94:28 - it changed like
94:29 - there was a point where the welcome room
94:30 - was everybody was muted with camera off
94:32 - and i was like
94:34 - [Laughter]
94:37 - by the way coding trade audience
94:40 - you are looking at the uh i don't know
94:43 - what the producers
94:44 - organizers the heroes of the itp ima
94:48 - lowrise spring show
94:49 - matt and ellen how is this experience
94:52 - this is like we're flipping the script
94:53 - back you're interviewing me on lip tv
94:55 - now i'm interviewing you been a guest on
95:00 - uh
95:02 - great um no it's been really nice we've
95:06 - had so many amazing people just kind of
95:08 - show up that i hadn't met before
95:10 - um maybe some of you from coding train
95:12 - are coming and joining us and
95:14 - it's just been really nice to meet some
95:15 - new folks
95:17 - and uh yeah we've been talking to
95:18 - students and they're saying that they
95:20 - got some great conversations happening
95:22 - people kind of showing up
95:23 - and chatting and um
95:26 - i don't know ellen and i were just
95:28 - shooting for fun chaos
95:29 - yeah uh not everything crashing and
95:31 - breaking crap chaos so i think so far
95:33 - we're succeeding with uh
95:35 - yeah it's great uh you know this the way
95:38 - you've organized the spatial chat stuff
95:39 - is working
95:40 - super well um and and people in the um
95:43 - just informally in like the youtube chat
95:45 - have been really like everyone's like
95:46 - what's spatial chat who made spatial
95:48 - chat this looks so cool so i think uh
95:50 - we're doing something for the spatial
95:51 - chat company should hopefully give us a
95:53 - discount next year with all the
95:54 - promotions
96:02 - [Laughter]
96:04 - sorry ellen i think i was interrupting
96:05 - you you're about to say something
96:08 - oh just that we have one more hour of
96:10 - the show left so
96:11 - if folks want to want to come join and
96:14 - hang out
96:14 - um we'd we'd love to have you for the
96:16 - next hour yeah and i'm i'm
96:18 - i'm winding down i haven't made it to
96:20 - every room yet i'm going to try to do a
96:22 - couple more
96:22 - but i'm winding down soon so definitely
96:25 - if you're watching this
96:26 - the real experience is the spatial chat
96:30 - url that is
96:31 - in the description as well as pin to the
96:32 - chat so don't don't watch this
96:34 - banter this like exciting banter between
96:38 - very tired after a long semester
96:42 - employees of new york university you got
96:45 - to get into the real thing and get feed
96:47 - off the energy and creativity of all the
96:48 - students in their projects
96:50 - all right i'm going to wander off to the
96:51 - corner to reset the room a bit and
96:53 - figure out where i'm going next so i'll
96:55 - let you get back to your
96:56 - okay welcoming of people
97:04 - okay how we doing everybody i'm muting
97:07 - myself
97:09 - i'm just going off into the corner
97:10 - people are following me
97:13 - oh this is exhausting um there's a few
97:16 - of you still watching i'm
97:18 - um i'm getting seeing some comments here
97:20 - and there in the chat
97:21 - i'm looking at my list of projects um
97:24 - let's see oh i meant to get the live
97:27 - poll going what's the
97:30 - chance oh no this is a terrible idea
97:33 - i have this live poll system that i'm
97:35 - working on to put an overlay
97:37 - on my live streams where people can vote
97:39 - on things and i meant to actually
97:42 - test that out because i i i did it on a
97:44 - recent live stream and had all sorts of
97:46 - issues
97:46 - and thanks to um different viewers who
97:49 - have been contributing a bunch of those
97:50 - issues have been ironed out
97:52 - and i meant to i was thinking oh i could
97:54 - like have people vote but if you're in
97:56 - the chat
97:57 - well i think as i say love wonderful
97:58 - name love
98:00 - um has asked a question how long have
98:03 - you been a professor
98:04 - for well the first class that i taught
98:08 - um formally uh was paid to teach at a
98:11 - university so i guess that's
98:13 - the measurement was in 2004. um at that
98:16 - time i taught as an adjunct
98:18 - um and then a few years later i had a
98:21 - full-time
98:22 - teaching position um and i've had
98:24 - various iterations of that
98:26 - over the years but i have now been
98:28 - associated with this
98:30 - program this department at nyu for
98:33 - um a little over 20 years now or 20
98:35 - years exactly because i started in 2001.
98:38 - um all right so that answered that
98:42 - question
98:43 - um let's see so i would like to if
98:45 - you're in the chat there
98:47 - is play games education which i'm really
98:50 - keen on going to that's probably my next
98:51 - stop
98:53 - machine learning perform performance
98:56 - grab bag and
98:58 - installation slash ar so let me know in
99:01 - the chat
99:02 - if you have you can see the rooms here
99:06 - if you have a preference as to where i
99:09 - should go but i think i'm probably going
99:11 - ahead
99:12 - to play games animation there's a
99:15 - project
99:16 - there that i think is of great interest
99:18 - to coding trained viewers
99:19 - called b5 you might recognize b5 yes i'm
99:22 - saying b
99:23 - as in uh bagel not uh
99:26 - uh uh uh pea as in processing
99:29 - uh but maybe that'll be my last stop
99:31 - because honestly like i haven't
99:33 - it's 9 40 at night it was been a very
99:35 - busy day i kind of only had a bit of
99:37 - like a snack for dinner and i'm really
99:39 - starting to feel that pain right now
99:41 - um so i think i want to like allow
99:43 - myself to go to one more room
99:45 - and then kind of wrap up for the night
99:47 - how's everybody how's everybody okay
99:48 - with that
99:49 - so let's head over to play games
99:52 - education here we go
99:55 - and where am i i never know where i am
99:59 - when i drop into a page here people
100:03 - i'm gonna mute them
100:07 - where
100:13 - where am i
100:17 - is this me no here i am that's me oh i'm
100:20 - in b5
100:23 - that's where i was going
100:27 - uh hold on a sec uh hello uh
100:30 - this is a live broadcast as i uh
100:33 - i see people running for the hills which
100:35 - again is the appropriate reaction
100:39 - uh but you're welcome to stay um so i'm
100:42 - i'm wandering around i'm on the tail end
100:43 - here i've been seeing a lot of projects
100:45 - and
100:45 - my my mind is turning a little bit to
100:47 - mush but i know that this particular
100:49 - project would be of great interest to
100:51 - coding trained viewers
100:52 - with the connection to creative coding
100:54 - uh you can see sort of b5 and
100:56 - how uh as an upside down p looks like uh
100:59 - there p5
101:00 - um paling i wonder if you could take if
101:02 - you if you have some time
101:04 - to introduce yourself and talk a little
101:05 - bit about this project
101:08 - uh yeah sure so i'm a graduating ima
101:11 - student and also
101:12 - incoming itp student um so this is my
101:16 - capstone project for ima and
101:18 - it's called b5 and it's like a visual
101:21 - programming language for creative coding
101:23 - so visual programming language is
101:25 - basically people use like
101:26 - wires and box instead of lines of code
101:29 - to
101:30 - to make programs um and b5 particularly
101:34 - and focused on creative coding so uh
101:36 - it's like a visual
101:38 - version of p5 and and i hope it's more
101:42 - intuitive and more
101:43 - playful and easier to learn than p5 and
101:48 - yeah so people can kind of get get their
101:50 - hands on it
101:51 - more easily and use it for like learning
101:53 - and fast prototyping
101:55 - and with when they want to learn like
101:57 - creative coding
102:02 - amazing i thought i thought i was muted
102:03 - i'm like looking for my unmute button
102:05 - but i think you can hear me
102:06 - um wonderful uh super exciting to see um
102:08 - so i guess i have a couple questions
102:10 - one is um you know my
102:13 - you know there's a lot of parallels here
102:14 - obviously it's a very different project
102:16 - as well but parallels to
102:17 - things something like scratch which is
102:19 - block based
102:21 - as well as other like data flow
102:23 - environments like max msp jitter
102:25 - scratch being more geared to younger
102:27 - audiences
102:29 - max msp jitter being to sort of you know
102:31 - i don't know if this is accurate to say
102:33 - but
102:33 - uh you know sort of like audio audio
102:36 - video uh advanced users maybe
102:38 - um is there um if you see that the
102:41 - audience for
102:42 - what you're building here is um
102:45 - intersects with p5 users but is it about
102:48 - a different age group or a different way
102:50 - of thinking like how do you
102:51 - differentiate that in your mind what's
102:53 - the
102:53 - i guess if i were to i'm like rambling i
102:55 - can't ask a question in one sentence i
102:56 - really need to
102:57 - like work on that but my question is who
102:59 - is your desired audience for this
103:02 - yeah yeah yeah so so you mentioned
103:04 - scratch and also like more advanced
103:06 - tools like
103:07 - max mxp and so so
103:10 - to me b5 is more like a midpoint uh
103:14 - of those two kinds of projects so uh
103:17 - products so so like in terms of design
103:20 - um it's kind of like a mix of
103:24 - node-based and block-based visual
103:25 - programming languages
103:27 - so so scratch is like a blog based so
103:30 - it's it's like you there's still like
103:32 - lines of code
103:33 - but they're like wrapped in blocks and
103:35 - you play with the blocks
103:36 - and for max it's like node base so to
103:39 - kind of connect the blocks with your
103:41 - with your wires and b5 is kind of like a
103:44 - mix of them
103:46 - so it's node based so you still have
103:48 - like separate blocks
103:49 - but also the location of the blocks
103:52 - still matters so so when you place a
103:55 - block like
103:56 - kind of like uh before another block uh
103:59 - their execution order will change so so
104:03 - so this is a particular design that is
104:05 - very special to b5 so you can
104:07 - kind of play with your code or like
104:09 - tweaks a little bit
104:11 - and to to have a like totally different
104:13 - like
104:14 - an effect and also um in terms of
104:17 - like the target users as you mentioned
104:19 - so scratches for like kids or
104:22 - like people who have no experience in
104:24 - programming
104:25 - and like there's definitely a lot of
104:28 - like
104:29 - very advanced or powerful visual
104:31 - programming languages
104:33 - and b5 is uh kind of also like in
104:36 - between so we want to
104:38 - so so i i try to make it like as simple
104:41 - and user friendly as possible
104:43 - follows i i'm trying to kind of give it
104:45 - some power so it can be used for like
104:47 - serious production
104:49 - and also for like a lot of uh you know
104:52 - creative coding projects and also for
104:54 - fast prototyping
104:55 - yeah and that's been the spirit i think
104:57 - of uh of you know the processing project
104:59 - certainly since the beginning
105:01 - it's very challenging to kind of like
105:03 - balance
105:04 - all these different trade-offs of
105:06 - different audiences but
105:07 - having a tool that is both something
105:09 - that people can get started with
105:11 - very quickly and easily and kind of see
105:13 - results immediately on their sort of
105:15 - first day
105:16 - or first five minutes even as well as
105:19 - that has depth to it and allows you to
105:21 - sort of build larger
105:22 - more involved projects um it's really
105:26 - uh is is really a wonderful sweet spot
105:30 - for these kind of creative coding tools
105:31 - and frameworks so it's great to see that
105:32 - you're kind of
105:33 - exploring exploring that um through this
105:36 - project
105:37 - so i see that you it's you know here on
105:39 - the you know i guess it's to the
105:41 - the right of me left me who knows what
105:43 - direction that is or
105:45 - everything's mirrored and backwards but
105:46 - there's the people can actually just go
105:48 - ahead and try it right now
105:49 - um um and are there what's what are your
105:52 - kind of like next steps for the project
105:54 - i know when we've talked about this
105:55 - before like we've talked about like
105:56 - sort of user testing and like you know
105:58 - sort of longer term roadmap for the
106:00 - project where are you
106:01 - kind of in the journey of it and what
106:03 - sort of like how can people who might be
106:05 - watching like help help out or get
106:07 - involved
106:08 - yeah so uh so first thing for for me of
106:12 - course is continue debugging it
106:14 - so although it's like live right now
106:16 - it's still very buggy and your pro
106:18 - so so it's very not recommended for for
106:20 - alexa's production right now
106:22 - using it and so i'll definitely add more
106:25 - like
106:26 - some basic features to it and also for
106:28 - people who
106:30 - who are interested in this project and
106:31 - also want to contribute
106:33 - uh the best way is probably to design a
106:35 - blog for yourself
106:37 - so you can find like how to design
106:39 - blocking the redmi file in the github
106:41 - repo
106:42 - and it's actually very easy to to kind
106:44 - of design a block and just like push it
106:46 - to
106:47 - the ripple and i guess that's uh the
106:50 - most meaningful or
106:51 - like the most wonky way for for for
106:54 - contributors to contribute to this
106:56 - project right now so designing a block
106:57 - would be something like
106:59 - if um like this might already be
107:01 - implemented but like if they're
107:02 - if purlin noise wasn't available as a
107:05 - block that
107:06 - um i could contribute sort of like code
107:09 - in
107:09 - presumably javascript to write the code
107:11 - for that block you know
107:12 - yeah embed the perlin noise algorithm
107:14 - into it and then
107:16 - that would become part of b5 that people
107:18 - could get have inputs and outputs from
107:19 - that block is that the idea
107:21 - right right yes yes yes and so you can
107:23 - define
107:24 - like the the style of the block the
107:27 - the input output nodes what are they and
107:29 - their descriptions
107:30 - and yeah so so i have a like kind of
107:33 - like a template for that and you can
107:35 - just like put putting those information
107:37 - if i render block for you wonderful
107:40 - awesome
107:40 - cool that's very exciting uh great work
107:42 - it's super exciting to
107:43 - to see and if um i guess if people um
107:46 - have questions or they find issues with
107:48 - it
107:48 - posting in the sort of issues on the
107:50 - github page is that the best place for
107:52 - feedback and questions uh yes definitely
107:55 - awesome all right so everyone please
107:57 - check out and give a b5
107:58 - editor.app a try um and you can join you
108:02 - can check out the github repo and more
108:03 - info about
108:04 - paling's work at his website there
108:06 - thanks so much for sharing this with us
108:07 - thank you thank you
108:12 - okay i just heard you
108:15 - this is my new technique when i need to
108:17 - like sort of have a momentary break here
108:20 - is just turn off my camera and mute my
108:22 - microphone
108:23 - all right so let's have let me zoom out
108:25 - here and see what we can see
108:27 - um hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
108:29 - inner oracle
108:30 - itp sandbox
108:33 - and soul train machine says i'll be
108:36 - right back i was kind of wanted to see
108:38 - this
108:38 - all-terrain machine but it says i'll be
108:40 - right back so i think we have to wait
108:43 - um i'm looking for oh
108:46 - sub to vizio let's um i think this is
108:48 - i'm trying to hit some low res
108:50 - projects so that's also uh let's see if
108:52 - we can wander over here
108:54 - let me let me turn my camera back on
108:57 - um and mute myself
109:01 - and let's see if i can zoom in
109:06 - hello uh i'm a a live broadcast visitor
109:12 - is this is this project open for
109:14 - business
109:16 - okay hi adam nice to see you um so for
109:19 - anybody who's just kind of oops let me
109:21 - remove myself
109:22 - in this way um who is um a wandering
109:25 - nearby
109:26 - i'm a simul casting this uh spatial chat
109:29 - room to
109:30 - uh to youtube wandering through various
109:32 - projects
109:33 - and uh adam here has graciously just
109:36 - spontaneously agreed to
109:38 - to share his work so if uh could you
109:40 - would if you have a minute to introduce
109:41 - yourself and talk about
109:42 - a subdivisio exclamation point i'd love
109:44 - to hear about it
110:52 - it's starting to there's a little bit
110:54 - you can vary just
110:55 - at this point um and if i subdivide it
110:59 - again
111:00 - then it's taking oops each of those
111:03 - sorry i'm
111:05 - i've done a horrible thing which is that
111:07 - i had an
111:08 - audio glitch the last couple of minutes
111:12 - and so you're on oh it wasn't going
111:14 - through i
111:15 - hate to make you start all the way over
111:18 - um but i have that fixed now if you want
111:20 - to you're welcome to
111:22 - con to but yeah no uh but but yeah so
111:26 - sorry about that i wonder if you could
111:27 - just kind of
111:28 - circle back to the beginning of what you
111:29 - were uh uh
111:31 - explaining for the project sure take it
111:34 - uh go all the way back to the top or
111:36 - just start talking about the project
111:37 - yeah go introduce yourself again because
111:39 - i think uh
111:40 - it's great for people to get to know
111:41 - about your um work and where you're
111:43 - coming from
111:44 - if you don't mind yeah no problem all
111:46 - right cool
111:47 - um yeah so i'm adam colstock i'm a a
111:50 - computer science and a steam teacher in
111:53 - chicago for fourth through eighth
111:55 - graders
111:56 - uh and i've created on my um in the low
111:59 - res ima program
112:00 - um the first class of it about to
112:02 - graduate this summer
112:04 - uh so i've created subdivisio which is
112:07 - a tool that allows you to explore
112:09 - algorithmic art
112:11 - using one particular subdivision
112:13 - algorithm
112:15 - and so i can sort of just quickly walk
112:18 - through what what's happening with that
112:20 - um so the idea is you've got a
112:22 - four-sided shape that you start with
112:24 - and then you can divide it up once using
112:27 - this top slider
112:29 - so the division that it's doing is it's
112:31 - taking one point along the top edge and
112:33 - one point along
112:34 - the left edge and the opposite vertex
112:38 - from those two edges
112:39 - and it's connecting those up along a
112:41 - point that lies along the diagonal
112:44 - and so if i uh start to drag that point
112:48 - then it varies the design because these
112:51 - two points are both dependent on
112:53 - the position of the top point sort of
112:55 - how far along the line it is uh what
112:58 - proportion of the line it takes up
113:00 - and if i divide it again then it took
113:03 - each of those three cells and applied
113:06 - the same rule so this top cell here
113:09 - took two points along the edge and the
113:11 - opposite vertex
113:12 - and the same for the other one even
113:14 - though it's not a square it's a
113:16 - different kind of
113:17 - uh four-sided shape um it's doing the
113:19 - same rule
113:21 - but already at this point i can start to
113:22 - play around with the design a little bit
113:24 - so rather than using that same
113:26 - orientation for the first cell i can
113:28 - rotate it
113:29 - so you can see that that line that's
113:31 - connecting into the vertex
113:32 - is changing which orientation it has
113:36 - you could do that for any of the cells
113:38 - and then you can also
113:40 - add color um and
113:44 - so applying multiple subdivisions you
113:47 - start to get
113:48 - uh some patterns that emerge that you
113:50 - can play with by changing the color
113:53 - um of it and it has some elements of
113:56 - transparency so you can start to control
113:59 - what
113:59 - points are what colors are shining
114:01 - through
114:03 - and then the last thing i think that's a
114:05 - little bit interesting
114:06 - is right now it's all dependent on
114:09 - this top point um so if this line
114:13 - if this point is halfway so is this
114:15 - point
114:16 - and that point um but i could imagine
114:19 - those
114:19 - points not being tied to each other in
114:21 - terms of how far along the lines up they
114:23 - are so you can
114:24 - change the number of draggable points so
114:27 - if i have two
114:28 - then the top one becomes independent
114:31 - from the one over here
114:33 - and one middle is still dependent on the
114:35 - top one
114:36 - or you could have it so that all three
114:38 - points are independent so you can sort
114:40 - of
114:41 - play around yeah the design even more
114:43 - that way
114:45 - wow i can imagine just being sort of
114:47 - like hypnotized and you know i i i might
114:50 - often when i'm working on like a code
114:51 - example or something i can i can just
114:53 - spend
114:54 - hours and hours tweaking little like
114:56 - parameters and numbers and i i could
114:58 - really imagine having that kind of rich
114:59 - experience with this
115:01 - um i guess one thing i'm curious about
115:02 - especially with your background as a
115:04 - teacher
115:05 - um one is there a particular
115:09 - i mean i obviously i think this has a
115:11 - very wide audience like i would enjoy
115:12 - this as much as a fourth grader might
115:13 - enjoy this
115:14 - but um yeah is there a particular i
115:17 - guess i'm curious was there a particular
115:19 - like age group or kind of uh
115:22 - you know curriculum like my daughter who
115:24 - happens to be in fourth gr fourth grade
115:25 - came home today and said i learned
115:27 - decimals today
115:28 - so is there a particular um like topic
115:31 - and either
115:32 - math or uh geometry or computer science
115:35 - that this like
115:36 - specifically relates to from your
115:37 - teaching practice or um where did you
115:39 - get the idea for this i guess is kind of
115:41 - one way of asking the question
115:42 - yeah let me start with that question
115:44 - actually and then i can cycle around
115:46 - to the first one so i got the idea um
115:49 - i've been teaching uh for about 10 years
115:52 - or so
115:53 - and since i started teaching there's um
115:58 - software called dynamic geometry
116:00 - software um
116:01 - keyometer sketchpad is one example
116:03 - geogebra is an online version
116:05 - um and they really take advantage of the
116:07 - idea that
116:08 - uh there's all sorts of interesting
116:10 - geometric explorations you can do
116:13 - in a learning environment in which you
116:16 - can create geometric constructions by
116:18 - drawing points and lines
116:20 - and identifying relationships and
116:22 - constraints like things are parallel or
116:24 - defining particular angles
116:26 - but then dragging so that the things
116:29 - that have those relationships maintain
116:31 - them
116:31 - but those that can can very do and you
116:34 - can start to sort of
116:36 - see and explore different kinds of
116:37 - representations even like what the
116:39 - difference between
116:41 - an isosceles and an equilateral triangle
116:43 - is by
116:44 - um you know making it so two sides are
116:48 - the same length and then dragging any of
116:50 - the three points and seeing what's
116:51 - staying the same and what's changing
116:53 - different
116:54 - and you can be doing that with kids that
116:56 - are sort of in elementary school so i
116:57 - had that software
116:59 - um we would use it for some lessons um
117:01 - but i also started to like
117:02 - mess around and sort of create more
117:04 - artistic designs with it
117:06 - and i really enjoyed that um so one of
117:09 - the answers to the question is i'm
117:11 - interested in
117:12 - just a tool that will provide sort of a
117:14 - bridge between visual arts and
117:16 - mathematics so
117:17 - maybe you're coming to it with a visual
117:19 - arts background and you haven't really
117:21 - um thought about programming or
117:24 - algorithms much before
117:25 - um but you could step in and use this
117:27 - tool and it might sort of change about
117:29 - uh change how you think about what
117:32 - you're creating or maybe even lead you
117:34 - to want to like learn more about
117:35 - this kind of thing or you might be a
117:38 - programmer or mathematician someone that
117:39 - really enjoys numbers and then
117:41 - programming
117:42 - but haven't done much in the visual arts
117:44 - and you could come in and sort of see
117:46 - how some of the things that you're
117:47 - familiar with are being implied and
117:49 - applied in a visual thinking kind of way
117:52 - um
117:52 - so i think that's like my main
117:53 - motivation you know independent of age
117:56 - even
117:57 - um but uh
118:00 - certainly i i like the idea that
118:03 - um i teach at a school where we try and
118:07 - do things in an
118:08 - interdisciplinary way um so you know
118:12 - being able to come with up with a
118:13 - project that has
118:15 - an artistic output but which you could
118:18 - be
118:19 - exploring you know even with this one
118:22 - the idea that like
118:23 - how are these lines how are these points
118:25 - related they're the same
118:26 - proportion along each line so what is
118:29 - you know what does that mean for them to
118:31 - be the same proportion along the line um
118:34 - that could lead into something about the
118:36 - golden ratio if you wanted to or there's
118:38 - all kinds of directions
118:39 - you can take different things like that
118:41 - i i haven't
118:42 - been there to this place that i'm about
118:44 - to mention in a while because you know
118:46 - it's been
118:47 - a year of coronavirus but um
118:50 - the museum of math here in new york um
118:53 - has a lot of exhibits that i think kind
118:55 - of like strike a really nice balance
118:56 - there
118:57 - of being able to kind of just play
119:00 - um in a really sort of create playful
119:02 - creative uh
119:04 - um improvisational way um
119:08 - uh but kind of also and tying those to
119:10 - specific
119:11 - um kind of well-known algorithms or
119:13 - techniques and kind of
119:14 - wandering back and forth between
119:16 - thinking about the math behind something
119:18 - versus just
119:19 - enjoying the sort of aesthetic quality
119:21 - and the sort of like surprise and
119:22 - discovery of it so i could really
119:24 - imagine
119:25 - um this project um working really well
119:28 - in you know that's what you know i think
119:29 - just being on the web is like in many
119:31 - ways just like the perfect place for it
119:32 - but also um like being in uh a kind of
119:36 - context like
119:36 - like the museum of math um um it really
119:40 - would fit right into that kind of space
119:41 - so
119:42 - great work and so if folks want to try
119:44 - it out i see the
119:45 - the best place is just to go right to
119:46 - the link that's right here there's a
119:48 - video
119:49 - um and um and yeah is there any any
119:52 - other
119:52 - links that people should go to or know
119:53 - about if they want to like learn more
119:54 - about this work or you
119:56 - uh no at this point those are the the
119:59 - two most direct links
120:00 - i would say about a month or so from now
120:02 - it'll probably all be put together
120:04 - in a website for you know my uh thesis
120:07 - project
120:08 - but uh for now those are the the best
120:10 - way to be able to explore it a little
120:12 - bit awesome
120:12 - great all right so this is i forget that
120:14 - with the for the low-res
120:16 - uh uh program um you're you while
120:19 - while this is the end of a semester
120:20 - there's like a big thing happening this
120:22 - summer which is like
120:23 - really more of the culmination so it's
120:25 - exciting to hear that you'll be
120:26 - continuing to work on this and i can't
120:27 - wait to
120:28 - uh follow and see where it leads great
120:31 - thanks wonderful
120:32 - thank you so much for sharing sure no
120:34 - problem
120:38 - okay i have muted and i'm wandering
120:42 - zooming out let's see
120:46 - soul train machine is back i think we
120:48 - should finish off with soul train
120:52 - machine
121:07 - bye is it okay if i barge on in here
121:10 - with my giant live broadcast
121:12 - sign yes oh my god
121:15 - that [ __ ] then um
121:18 - i'm uh i'm i'm running on empty here
121:21 - running on fumes here i've been kind of
121:22 - like wandering around
121:23 - yeah but i i thought i saw i saw
121:26 - soul train machine i thought this could
121:28 - be a way to complete the circle of this
121:32 - strange evening in spatial chat so um
121:37 - um yeah so in case anybody who's happens
121:40 - to be nearby i'm kind of simulcasting
121:42 - this
121:43 - um on youtube to a small audience right
121:45 - now um
121:46 - kind of wandering around so feel free to
121:49 - some people have
121:50 - done the appropriate reaction of just
121:51 - run away it seems like i'm near them
121:53 - but mary hopefully you'll stay um would
121:55 - you mind do you have a minute to
121:56 - introduce yourself and tell us a little
121:58 - bit about
121:58 - this project to take us out of this uh
122:02 - what's the what's the word to like close
122:04 - it's not the end of the evening because
122:05 - i know this is going on for 30 more
122:07 - minutes but
122:08 - yeah that's like as i hear my your your
122:10 - broadcast yes my bro
122:11 - yes thank you it would be my pleasure so
122:14 - my name is mary no terry i am a
122:17 - graduating itp
122:18 - second year and uh the project i'm
122:21 - presenting tonight
122:22 - is the first in a series of prototypes
122:26 - that i will be making
122:27 - over the next few months uh that i'm
122:29 - building towards what i'm calling the
122:31 - soul train
122:32 - machine so when i say soul train i mean
122:34 - soul train
122:35 - like the long-running
122:38 - tv show where people showed off their
122:41 - amazing moves and
122:42 - new music in new fashion and so this is
122:46 - a project that's very much grounded
122:47 - in the vocabulary
122:52 - of that style of funk soul disco
122:55 - so i used the ml5 neural network
122:59 - to train a an algorithm
123:02 - on some very basic disco moves that i
123:05 - just did in front of the camera
123:07 - uh in or this in order to do this
123:09 - prototype
123:10 - so the two moves are and you can go to
123:13 - the link up here
123:14 - uh and test it out yourself but the two
123:16 - the moves are
123:18 - uh like a snap up here a roll
123:21 - and a like head shape like a tina turner
123:25 - style head shake
123:27 - um and at the moment the
123:30 - what i'm building towards is having
123:32 - those be
123:33 - triggers for musical events at the
123:36 - moment
123:37 - the musical events are mostly just
123:38 - triggered by pressing a button
123:40 - uh but there are some sliders where it's
123:42 - like if you're closer to the camera
123:44 - it gets uh clearer there's a low-pass
123:48 - filter
123:48 - or if you go up and down the volume goes
123:50 - up and down
123:52 - um but the idea is yeah to turn this
123:55 - into a standalone
123:58 - web app where a couple of people
124:02 - can join in and control music through
124:05 - their
124:06 - groovy dance moves
124:11 - awesome and so this can be tried out
124:13 - right now at this very moment
124:15 - just by going to that link that's right
124:17 - there oh i just clicked on it okay hold
124:19 - on
124:20 - i'm i'm gonna save this i'm gonna uh oh
124:23 - my goodness
124:24 - okay i'm going to uh i'm coming back to
124:26 - spatial chat
124:28 - uh i'm gonna go that'll be a perfect
124:29 - thing for me to test and try you know
124:31 - one of the things
124:32 - um that i that i've actually like um
124:34 - that i find to be a challenge with
124:36 - um some of these systems that do pose
124:39 - detection especially on the web
124:40 - oh my goodness and i think my i have to
124:42 - actually close this because my computer
124:44 - is about to
124:45 - freak out um is that people use their
124:48 - computer like the way that i'm
124:50 - right now which is kind of like hunched
124:52 - over it
124:53 - like with my face next to the laptop
124:55 - whereas this really
124:56 - is about i'm imagining and it strikes me
124:59 - from your description of the sort of
125:00 - like
125:01 - full body um you know like let it all
125:04 - out kind of experience and i
125:06 - you know i know that you know to the
125:07 - extent that you that you're still in
125:09 - development with this
125:10 - like is that something that um do you
125:12 - have any have you been have you tested
125:14 - with people is that
125:15 - something that you've sort of thought
125:16 - about of how to like uh sort of onboard
125:19 - people
125:19 - into being in the right sort of like
125:21 - physical space and mindset
125:23 - for it or oh that's a really good
125:26 - question
125:27 - and i haven't gotten to the stage of
125:29 - user testing inside of
125:31 - me and my roommates so we will see
125:34 - and we're all pretty out there people to
125:36 - begin with
125:37 - um but that's something that i'm
125:39 - definitely gonna have to keep in mind
125:40 - and i think uh i guess
125:44 - i also am aiming to create an uh
125:48 - a browser-based experience that is
125:52 - if that evokes uh a certain
125:55 - like time and space like time and place
125:58 - uh
125:59 - and i this is kind of for people who
126:02 - like me
126:11 - um and so uh
126:15 - but that's i really appreciate that
126:16 - question because
126:18 - i have a tendency to design for myself
126:20 - sometime yeah
126:22 - well it's a great way to start i don't
126:25 - know
126:25 - it's yeah it's just something that like
126:27 - i've just i've spent a lot of time
126:29 - working with the post-detection stuff as
126:30 - you probably
126:31 - uh um no and so like it's it's something
126:34 - that's sort of like always top of mind
126:35 - for me but i
126:36 - i love i just like like i think you have
126:39 - a successful
126:40 - interactive web-based project if you can
126:44 - get people to like
126:45 - stand up and move their whole body like
126:46 - it's such a nice like goal
126:48 - to like to break people out of um kind
126:51 - of their
126:51 - just sort of default way of sitting
126:53 - engaging in their computer so that's
126:55 - super it's super cool and exciting to
126:56 - see and i i i i
126:58 - i'm so thrilled and excited to see as a
127:01 - nice note to end on to sort of see
127:03 - uh the ml5 neural network and the
127:05 - posenet um machine learning model which
127:07 - are two things that i've spent a lot of
127:08 - time
127:09 - like banging on for um the last uh bunch
127:12 - of years so it's
127:13 - great it's really exciting to see those
127:14 - applied in a project here
127:17 - and i have to thank you for banging on
127:19 - them i have to thank you
127:21 - very very much for saving my rump
127:24 - in more than like in terms of making
127:26 - this work
127:27 - so thank you awesome well
127:30 - congratulations
127:31 - um i'm gonna what i'm gonna do actually
127:32 - this is perfect i'm gonna see if i can
127:34 - get it to work with me as i leave as i
127:37 - launch
127:43 - um and off into um
127:47 - it's like way past my bedtime this is
127:49 - insane that it's after 10 o'clock at
127:50 - night all of a sudden
127:51 - so thank you so much for sharing this
127:54 - congratulations on all of your
127:56 - work and accomplishments at itp and i
127:58 - i'm i'm excited to see what comes next
128:01 - thank you so much awesome okay bye mary
128:05 - okay so here i am i'm moving up here i'm
128:07 - muting
128:08 - turning off my camera let's see i i feel
128:11 - like no i feel like i'm completely
128:13 - by myself here let's bring this back
128:15 - nope bring this back nope yep here we
128:17 - are
128:17 - all right we're going to click on it try
128:19 - it for ourselves
128:21 - i'm going to close out a spatial chat
128:24 - and let's see let's play some sounds
128:31 - um i have all sorts of computer issues
128:36 - so let's see i hear my children getting
128:39 - ready for pet dumpsters
128:41 - let's try now let's try let's get ready
128:44 - to boogie
128:50 - do i need to like oh you know what it's
128:51 - not getting my camera
128:53 - hold on we're gonna re we're gonna quit
128:55 - chrome
128:56 - we're to quit obs we're gonna leave loop
128:58 - back open because i need that for the
129:00 - audio
129:01 - come on everybody we're gonna make this
129:02 - happen
129:08 - there we go there we go
129:18 - i don't know if i can hear the audio but
129:20 - it might be my
129:21 - uh issue with my audio it's all weird
129:24 - wonky
129:25 - chrome is on headphones are on
129:28 - going out to you this week after all
129:30 - right let's see let's see
129:32 - okay we're getting up
129:35 - okay here we are snaps
129:38 - roll okay hold on i got some music here
129:52 - maybe this is better
129:57 - what's become of my life
130:13 - all right oh it's bedtime we're this old
130:15 - man
130:16 - oh you can't hear the audio
130:20 - oh no that's probably from the past well
130:22 - this was
130:23 - fun mary i'm so sorry
130:26 - for everything that i've done
130:32 - this is really fun i'm i'm wondering why
130:35 - um if uh if if maybe i missed something
130:39 - with this the audio here
130:41 - but um i'll just assume
130:46 - that i'm doing something wrong here
130:48 - anyway
130:52 - this has been quite the live stream
130:57 - some nice relaxing music here
131:01 - uh thank you all for um
131:04 - tuning into this with me i'm gonna um
131:07 - [Music]
131:09 - just remind you that for the next 20
131:11 - minutes
131:13 - you can go and experience it for
131:15 - yourself
131:17 - the itp ima
131:20 - low res spring show 2021.
131:23 - congratulations
131:24 - to all of the amazing students and staff
131:28 - and faculty and everybody who's worked
131:30 - so hard
131:31 - all year all semester boy it's been a
131:33 - year an academic year
131:35 - summer is here we all hopefully will be
131:38 - on the beach with our ukuleles
131:40 - where's the link um
131:44 - but i believe you can go to i know
131:50 - if you're here watching this right now
131:52 - then all you need to do
131:54 - is go right to this link right here
131:57 - i might pop back in there without the
131:59 - pressure and stress of live streaming
132:03 - um oh is the chrome tap itself muted
132:06 - says love it's possible
132:08 - please everybody try out the soul train
132:10 - machine
132:12 - go visit the show i'll be back on
132:15 - thursday for a coding stream
132:19 - i've got some updates and different
132:21 - things to show and demo
