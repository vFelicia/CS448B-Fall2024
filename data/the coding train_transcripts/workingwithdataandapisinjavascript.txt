00:00 - Hello, and welcome to a
new course on the coding
00:02 - train called Working with
Data and APIs in JavaScript.
00:06 - So this, I imagine, as a
wonderful next step for you.
00:09 - Are you a beginner programmer?
00:10 - Did you maybe just
learn JavaScript?
00:12 - Maybe by watching my code
programming with P5 Just
00:15 - for Beginners video series?
00:16 - This is the place for
you to take a next step.
00:18 - In particular, themed
around working with data.
00:21 - I'm going to look at tabular
data, CSV, what's a CSV?
00:25 - JSON data.
00:26 - What's JSON?
00:27 - But all of that is
really just the warm up,
00:29 - the opening act
for the main event.
00:31 - The main attraction, what
you're really here to see,
00:33 - which is server side
program with node.
00:35 - If you've only ever done P5 JS
or other types of client side
00:38 - JavaScript programming,
you're missing a big piece
00:40 - of the puzzle in terms of
the kinds of web applications
00:43 - that you can build.
00:44 - All the material for this
course is broken down
00:46 - into three modules.
00:47 - The first module is just some
client side JavaScript basics,
00:49 - some native JavaScript
building blocks for what I'm
00:52 - going to do in modules
2 and 3, and there I'm
00:55 - going to build full
stack web applications.
00:58 - The two projects
I'm going to make,
00:59 - one is called the
data selfie app
01:01 - and the other one is
called the weather here.
01:03 - They're both based on
projects by Joey Lee who
01:06 - develop these sample projects
as part of his teaching at ITP,
01:09 - and of course, [INAUDIBLE].
01:11 - So I'm going to go from start
to finish to build two web
01:14 - applications for you,
and hopefully, you'll
01:16 - be able to build on what I
make and create your own web
01:19 - applications.
01:19 - If you happen to make a project,
your own creative project,
01:22 - you can go to the
coding train dot
01:23 - com, where there's a
page for the course,
01:25 - and you'll be able
to share links
01:26 - to the projects you make there.
01:28 - Before I get started
with module 1,
01:29 - there's one more introductory
video that will come next.
01:32 - That's just going
to go over what
01:33 - do you need to have installed
on your computer, what kind
01:35 - of tools do you need, what
kind of prerequisite knowledge
01:37 - you need to have before you
get started with the video,
01:39 - so take a look at that.
01:40 - And hope you enjoyed this ride
on the coding train, Working
01:43 - with Data and APIs
in JavaScript.
