04:48 - I think you should hear me now have you
05:01 - don't see me but you hear me I have a
05:03 - new button that mutes and unmutes my
05:07 - microphone and in a moment I have a
05:09 - button it switches to the camera that
05:11 - I'm in and this song ends in about 14
05:15 - seconds 13:05 county waitress flows six
05:23 - five four three two and you're on do you
05:29 - see me do you hear me is it Monday no
05:32 - Tuesday I don't know what day it is
05:34 - I do it's Tuesday welcome to the coding
05:39 - train feel like it's speaking very loud
05:41 - and people in the hallway are going to
05:43 - listen and hear me and I feel
05:45 - embarrassed
05:47 - hmm so this is unusual that I'm here on
05:51 - a Tuesday I missed Friday I'm having a
05:53 - hard time if I'm being totally honest
05:55 - here's the good news I have I've setup
06:00 - I've worked very hard with a lot of
06:01 - people's help I can barely take any
06:03 - credit for this but I have a new studio
06:06 - that I am live broadcasting from and
06:08 - soon I'm hoping to make the studio
06:09 - available for other people in particular
06:12 - to the NYU community because this is a
06:14 - room that's at NYU where I broadcast my
06:18 - other separate thing independent take
06:20 - the coding trade it's very complicated
06:22 - so studio is going well I have new
06:25 - buttons I can mute my microphone watch
06:27 - this I can I have this button that makes
06:32 - my laptop disappear but look isn't that
06:35 - weird look at that that is crazy but so
06:38 - if I you need to like type in a secret
06:40 - password look at that okay and then I
06:43 - can make myself disappear
06:44 - there go now if I just need to show you
06:46 - the screen there we go
06:48 - I feel like the focus might be off a
06:51 - little bit I def I need I I'm gonna get
06:54 - I'm going to get someone to come help me
06:55 - with tuning the cameras a bit focus
06:57 - white balance that sort of thing I know
07:00 - also these lights
07:01 - reflecting in my glasses I turned them a
07:03 - little bit so maybe that's a little bit
07:05 - better I don't know I do but so things
07:08 - are good this is what I was saying
07:09 - things are good in that the studio seems
07:11 - to be working all that sort of stuff but
07:16 - I'm having trouble getting sort of
07:18 - regular schedule going so today was like
07:21 - a target of opportunity I have a round
07:23 - till 11:30 a little bit past 11:30 free
07:27 - so I thought I would try to do a live
07:28 - stream I missed last week so I'm gonna
07:30 - try to do two this week I my goal is
07:32 - once a week but one of the reasons why
07:36 - I've actually had a little bit of
07:38 - trouble live-streaming find a live
07:39 - stream and this this may fill you with
07:43 - joy or it might disappoint you I have no
07:44 - idea but I have a new video that
07:46 - hopefully will be out later this week
07:48 - that I that I should that I did a coding
07:51 - challenge in that was not from the
07:52 - studio and it's back from a different
07:53 - secret location then I will not say
07:55 - anything more about when the video comes
07:57 - out you will see this new secret
07:58 - location I don't have the capability of
08:00 - live-streaming from there so it was
08:01 - recorded and then edited but I hope to
08:04 - be doing these new this new style of
08:08 - video in addition to the live stream so
08:10 - not replacing but in addition and let's
08:12 - see how that goes so I look forward to
08:13 - when that comes out later this week I
08:15 - don't being very vague about it I look
08:18 - forward to hearing your feedback I will
08:20 - provide a sneak preview to this video in
08:23 - our coding train member and patron slack
08:27 - group so if you're thinking about
08:29 - wanting to join if you want to see a
08:30 - video like 24 hours earlier than
08:32 - somebody else I don't know why that's a
08:34 - thing now would be the time to do so
08:37 - I'm also planning to I'm looking a
08:42 - little on the bright side it says alka
08:45 - but i'm looking sharp
08:46 - thank you see the problem is when I look
08:50 - at the chat I lose my train of thought
08:55 - it's a sad life it's so sad
09:00 - ah I will have some new announcements -
09:03 - about the rewards program for men coding
09:07 - training members so I'm revamping that
09:09 - I've got some new ideas that are kicking
09:11 - around some new stuff will be launching
09:13 - so hopefully you're hear about that
09:14 - later this week are next week and just
09:18 - on cue we have a new member
09:21 - Aaron B so welcome Aaron beam now oh no
09:26 - I haven't implemented this yet soon
09:27 - there there's some new - some new tools
09:30 - in the YouTube membership thing I
09:32 - shouldn't go on too long about this
09:33 - because most of you are just you're
09:34 - watching and you don't want to hear me
09:35 - talk about the membership stuff but once
09:37 - you join there should be information
09:39 - about how to get your slack invite and
09:40 - all that sort of stuff it might not have
09:42 - shown up for you but we're fixing up
09:44 - that stuff and hopefully by the end of
09:45 - this week that we'll be in better shape
09:48 - okay so let me just first before I go
09:55 - off into my rambling nonsense my goal
09:59 - for today is to do two tutorials on two
10:02 - functions one tutorial on each function
10:05 - there's two functions one tutorial for
10:07 - each that makes two in the ml5 jazz
10:10 - library if you're not familiar with ml 5
10:12 - Jas now is a good time for me to open up
10:14 - my web browser and tell you the ml 5 GS
10:19 - is a friendly machine learning library
10:20 - for the web it is a library that is
10:24 - built on top of tensorflow j/s it is one
10:26 - that I work on with a lot of different
10:28 - collaborators here at NYU and throughout
10:31 - the greater open source community and so
10:34 - I have a playlist going of video
10:36 - tutorials there's some really exciting
10:38 - what I find to be incredibly exciting
10:40 - new features that are in development in
10:42 - ml 5 they're not part of the release yet
10:44 - if I can get my act together later this
10:46 - week I'll do a second live stream with
10:48 - those new features but I wanted to fill
10:50 - in some gaps about a couple models that
10:54 - are here in ml 5 that I have not touched
10:56 - on in particular unit and body pics and
11:00 - both of those are examples of image
11:02 - segmentation so Ojai coding garden with
11:05 - CJ
11:12 - great I love this member think he's so
11:15 - happy
11:15 - I'm gonna get some lights that blink or
11:17 - something when somebody joins that'll be
11:18 - fun
11:19 - shurik Schaick thank you so much when
11:22 - you first join you get a little this dot
11:24 - iconic what is the world what is this
11:27 - world and my body is it okay that I'm
11:30 - buying into this that you'd like sign up
11:31 - and you for this membership thing and
11:33 - you get it emoji icon okay so the
11:40 - websites starting to look different
11:42 - already we're doing some new stuff with
11:45 - the website I'm super excited about it
11:46 - but so this is that's the goal that's
11:48 - really my only goal for today I want to
11:50 - show community contributions I want to
11:52 - do two tutorials I want to thank the
11:54 - sponsor of the coding tre watches I even
11:56 - have a button on my mouse buzzer oh god
11:59 - oh stream deck that will bring this cup
12:00 - up so thank you I have the this live
12:03 - stream is once again sponsored I took a
12:04 - break from that for a little bit while
12:05 - it's figuring things out but I think I'm
12:07 - settled so thank you to brilliant
12:09 - org if you're interested in finding out
12:12 - more about brilliant tonight hopefully I
12:16 - opened up the correct banner I can't
12:19 - remember me - duh or just coding train
12:21 - hold on I might have to fix this this is
12:25 - welcome to my incompetence II hold on I
12:28 - know how to check this just talk amongst
12:30 - yourself for a second
12:33 - oh yeah new member mama who's supposed
12:44 - to be a coding livestream not just to
12:45 - thank the new members livestream oh
12:47 - where do I go well this is very hard to
12:50 - use this computer over here it's a PC
12:56 - can anybody see the description of this
12:59 - video I kiss oh wait I know where to
13:02 - look I have it definitely have it
13:04 - correct in the description that's right
13:06 - up to look I don't swap it out here's
13:11 - the live stream no it's me
13:13 - oh yeah that's a mistake let me fix that
13:16 - banner hold on
13:19 - live exciting oh I thought I was being
13:21 - so good and I was gonna have no issues
13:32 - I don't have it on worst
14:00 - [Music]
14:07 - [Music]
14:14 - [Music]
14:29 - all right well I will take a break I'll
14:40 - take a break and fix that later all
14:45 - right back to Java so if you're
14:48 - interested in learning more about
14:49 - brilliant go to brilliant org slash
14:51 - coding trained not Nova Nova I mean the
14:54 - that is part of the coding train but
14:56 - this particular URL is just slash coding
14:57 - tree want womp-womp-womp okay let me
15:07 - okay I'm gonna next thing the next
15:08 - segment I want to do is show you
15:10 - community contributions but I have
15:12 - something else I have to show you first
15:14 - gonna have to send an email about the
15:16 - air I can feel myself palpitating new
15:19 - member again this is crazy
15:21 - hello Jonathan Barbra this is nuts
15:24 - and I've never had so many new members
15:27 - all at once so I'm about to change to a
15:29 - different camera view here we go I'm
15:32 - gonna press this button go over here now
15:34 - I it's this camera is set with a lot of
15:36 - automatic settings so I think it's gonna
15:38 - start to lighten up cause it's like auto
15:40 - white balancing and it also has auto
15:43 - focus hello but I am very excited to
15:46 - show you something this isn't it's a
15:54 - smart surface it's magnetic so I can
15:57 - hang things up here which I'm very
15:58 - excited about that should open up a lot
16:00 - of possibilities and this is a sheet of
16:04 - draw a dry-erase sheet so I can now
16:06 - write here and once again I have my
16:09 - ability to diagram I don't know how
16:11 - visible that is for you and certainly as
16:13 - I come closer it's gonna go out of focus
16:14 - so I probably should focus the camera
16:18 - specific
16:19 - they just on the wall and tune the white
16:22 - balance and all that stuff but at least
16:23 - for now and have this green cloth at
16:27 - least for now I can use this as a
16:30 - whiteboard so that's what I'll be doing
16:31 - today you might remember last week it's
16:33 - over here you can't really see it I
16:34 - guess I could but this was my whiteboard
16:37 - from last week which still has all the
16:39 - stuff that I listed on it but it's just
16:40 - over here in the corner right now the
16:43 - thing that's great about this is it
16:45 - seemed a far as I can tell it's matte
16:47 - and it's not really reflecting the
16:48 - lights too too much so it should this
16:51 - should work better than what I had
16:53 - before
16:53 - alright so that's the other new thing
16:56 - and then I come over here and I press
16:57 - this button and then I am back over here
17:01 - okay people are asking when was the last
17:05 - time there was a livestream with Simon
17:07 - absent you would think something must be
17:09 - wrong if there's Simon's not here oh and
17:11 - I don't have the Select channel open let
17:13 - me get that open here we go oh my god
17:18 - too many things how do I do this
17:21 - there we go very faint all right so
17:29 - we'll see how this goes today each day I
17:31 - make each time my livestream I make a
17:33 - small incremental improvement I found
17:43 - this bug in the kitchen by the way and I
17:44 - loved it I think this is a Scrabble mug
17:45 - it's got an N with one and then all the
17:50 - other letter distributions back here
17:53 - okay now if you recall one of the things
18:01 - that happens on the coding train is I
18:02 - make a coding example like a coding
18:04 - challenge and last week previously
18:07 - previously on the coding train I
18:11 - programmed a ukulele tuner now I should
18:14 - mention and many of you rightly pointed
18:16 - this out and I don't know if any of you
18:17 - who are actually watching this live with
18:18 - the random people who showed up it's a
18:20 - one video that I made many rightly
18:22 - pointed out that this is not a
18:24 - particularly accurate or efficient way
18:26 - to make a ukulele tuner or to accurately
18:29 - estimate pitch based on audio input and
18:32 - they're certainly like
18:33 - highly specific mathematical ways of
18:36 - doing that related to a FFT algorithms
18:38 - and sound analysis more what I was
18:41 - attempting to demonstrate was a
18:43 - particular machine learning pitch
18:44 - detection model that happens to be in ml
18:46 - five so it was a nice opportunity to use
18:48 - it to create this tuner so if I click
18:51 - here on to the challenge we can see the
18:54 - videos here and I'm gonna just quickly
18:56 - run mine see if it still works it's not
19:03 - very promising
19:04 - oh I know what the issue is wow this is
19:10 - a weird this is ah you know what this is
19:13 - a good thing to bring up so why is this
19:15 - not working I asked you the viewing
19:17 - audience and then you will near this
19:19 - question about 30 seconds from now and I
19:21 - won't be able to wait till you try to
19:22 - suggest an answer so the reason why this
19:25 - is not working is Chrome for good reason
19:29 - I would say but I think this is a
19:31 - debatable point but will not begin any
19:34 - audio source any playing of audio or
19:37 - recording of audio and that's probably
19:39 - it even more important in terms of
19:41 - privacy without a user interaction first
19:44 - so in other words we want the Chrome I
19:46 - suppose the reasoning is to protect
19:48 - against a website that might syrup tisha
19:50 - sleet record your audio you can imagine
19:52 - how problematic that could be so I
19:55 - didn't so in this I prefer me to
19:58 - actually have programmed this ukulele
20:00 - tuner so that it would work we need a
20:02 - button like start listening or something
20:03 - which I didn't include because if I just
20:07 - go to the actual editor view there is a
20:10 - user interaction that happens on this
20:12 - page me pressing this Run button and now
20:15 - it works so while I'm in the editor view
20:18 - it happens to work but when I'm not it
20:19 - doesn't so I fibula tune ukulele
20:24 - [Music]
20:57 - okay so that was this was the project I
20:59 - made I would say the big issues with
21:02 - this the things that I don't like about
21:03 - it are mostly all have to do with user
21:06 - interaction and visual design and I
21:08 - would say these are not my strengths I
21:10 - don't know what my strengths are but
21:12 - they're certainly not that and so what I
21:14 - enjoy doing with these coding challenges
21:16 - is making the sort of like technical
21:18 - demonstration of the idea and asking the
21:21 - viewing audience to make their own
21:22 - version of it maybe with a creative
21:24 - twist or being more thoughtful about the
21:26 - interaction design lots of possibilities
21:28 - there so I'm gonna close my version out
21:33 - and I'm going to go now to this page I'm
21:36 - gonna show you oh wait so many of these
21:38 - came in okay well 3m Italy three of them
21:41 - are from Simon but there's a lot of
21:46 - these contributions so I would like to
21:49 - spend more time in my live streams
21:51 - sharing work that people are making from
21:53 - the audience and from elsewhere in the
21:55 - world you know I really want to feature
21:57 - a lot of different kinds of people who
21:58 - are doing stuff with code from different
22:03 - and so I'm gonna take a moment to do
22:05 - that right now so I'm just gonna click
22:06 - through these in order and we'll sort of
22:08 - see how they work and give my commentary
22:11 - on them what could go wrong what could
22:13 - possibly go wrong so let's try this one
22:14 - by Luciano tonay allow I don't need to
22:20 - translate the page okay so let's see
22:23 - here I think we so I think we're gonna
22:27 - run into this issue and we can look to
22:34 - see the audio so this is what I'm
22:36 - talking about
22:36 - user gesture needed to start audio
22:39 - context please click so I don't know how
22:43 - to force
22:44 - this to work like if I can click fast
22:46 - enough oh there we go
22:49 - so I got lucky so I just clicked a bunch
22:51 - of time so now let's try this so I like
23:00 - this I like so that one thing I like
23:02 - about this is it's closer to the what
23:04 - you might typically see with the tuner
23:05 - where there's kind of a dial and the
23:08 - dial is when it's centered is at the
23:10 - right frequency I might say that this is
23:12 - jumping around a lot a lot of that has
23:14 - to do with pitch detection model and the
23:16 - fact that I'm speaking and there's noise
23:18 - in this room but some type of
23:19 - interpolation some other visual
23:22 - indicator right now I think this is a
23:25 - problem with mine is just the like on or
23:26 - off quality of these is it tuned or not
23:29 - you want to be able see am I getting
23:30 - closer or further I think could help
23:31 - here but I like this idea of having it
23:34 - be more dial like okay let's try this
23:38 - one by mine bill I think I'm just gonna
23:45 - click into the editor I love this I'm
23:51 - like filling up a circle let's try
23:56 - changing the note and see what happens
23:58 - [Music]
24:02 - you can see how the circles getting
24:04 - smaller again we've got this a lot of
24:07 - noise and this sort of green or red and
24:10 - no interpolation there which I think
24:12 - could could potentially help I like that
24:15 - there's this option of changing it to a
24:16 - guitar that is cool so the notes are
24:18 - different what it's looking for
24:19 - basically on zits are sometimes CJ
24:22 - writes sometimes having the dev tools
24:24 - open before the page loads allows the
24:26 - mic to work without interaction oh and I
24:28 - see Simon Tiger is just typing so I
24:31 - think Simon has made it to the live
24:32 - stream everybody do not do not worry
24:34 - everything's okay in the world okay next
24:40 - we have the ukulele tuner with a pitch
24:43 - trail by original Aang let's try this
24:46 - one oh oh I love this it's almost like
24:58 - those you know guitar hero style games
25:01 - where the notes are coming at you and
25:04 - you have to time the interaction there's
25:07 - this and I love the idea that I could
25:09 - create a picture from playing music here
25:11 - in a way I wonder if there's something
25:13 - to this beyond tuning which is a way of
25:15 - visualizing music and sound wonderful
25:18 - idea here ukulele tuner same model new
25:22 - design by David Schneider whoa whoa now
25:27 - this is great embedding the tone
25:28 - generator is a very smart idea and then
25:31 - here we've really got a nice dial going
25:33 - let's play so let's move this around
25:43 - so something seems a little off with the
25:45 - position of the dial again this is not
25:48 - the perfect the perfect way of doing
25:55 - pitch detection but I this now we're
25:57 - really starting to see something that
25:58 - has a very you know traditional dial
26:01 - like design I like that there's a little
26:03 - indicator of what the mic is doing
26:05 - somehow this worked right out of the box
26:08 - I wonder if if you know why if there is
26:14 - some kind of like user interaction
26:16 - embedded that I don't realize that I've
26:18 - done here but this is great to see what
26:20 - if I play different note it's Auto
26:24 - detecting their note it's great great
26:26 - job thank you David and now whoops we
26:31 - have three submissions from Simon let's
26:35 - look at them tuning all strings at once
26:38 - what is that even pause that possible
26:41 - [Music]
26:45 - let's see if the tip yeah so you'd think
26:51 - the dev tools opening would help but I'm
26:55 - just going to go to here and I'm going
26:57 - to do this like this
27:08 - so let's strike to you a little bit I
27:11 - [Music]
27:14 - like the yellow and I like the sort of
27:19 - like yellow color as a kind of warning
27:22 - sign I'm almost there
27:23 - another thing works pretty well having
27:42 - trouble getting my ear isn't so great
27:45 - I'm wonderful
27:47 - I love I like this of having all of them
27:49 - on one page here that's a nice design
27:51 - idea click to tune the next string so I
27:53 - think this are like different
27:54 - interaction design ideas right where one
27:57 - mine is just auto-detects which string
27:59 - another possibility is showing all of
28:01 - the strings and here's one where it's
28:03 - actually giving me instructions so this
28:05 - is nice it's like a tutorial walkthrough
28:07 - which i think is always helpful to the
28:08 - user so G is this one I suppose if I
28:14 - click it saw me to do so I like this as
28:18 - a design idea as well and then random
28:20 - number generator mmm this I don't know
28:23 - what this is let's see alright I'm
28:32 - fascinated by this what is going on here
28:36 - Simon
28:36 - temp error pitch pitch is it generating
28:41 - a random number based on the audio
28:44 - that's coming in well there's four
28:46 - submissions
28:47 - yeah violet writes I feel like this kind
28:50 - of project would be much easier in
28:51 - max/msp yes so p5.js the browser is not
28:56 - necessarily the optimal context for
28:59 - doing you know for creating this kind of
29:01 - sound processing application certainly
29:04 - other programming environments are you
29:06 - know geared and geared entirely around
29:08 - working with audio so I think that's a
29:10 - good point okay so I don't know Simon
29:15 - I'd love to hear more about this random
29:17 - number generator one two three I only
29:20 - see three
29:21 - according to Simon therefore oh wait
29:22 - original ukulele tuner I somehow missed
29:24 - that one okay so this is just a version
29:28 - of it that's much like mine with a
29:30 - slightly different interface okay great
29:33 - so thank you everyone for your ukulele
29:36 - tuner submissions I really enjoyed those
29:43 - next segment I'm gonna look at some more
29:47 - community contributions so let me go to
29:50 - you know me and I'm obsessed with this
29:52 - idea of spinning a wheel so let me go to
29:57 - github.com slash coding train slash
30:00 - website and we'll see david viewer david
30:04 - has created a wheel that actually will
30:08 - randomly pick a viewer contribution to
30:11 - feature
30:12 - so let's this is a little trial run here
30:15 - of this idea maybe we're going to work
30:17 - on this more so I think this is I
30:20 - actually don't know I think this is
30:22 - pulling from a spreadsheet of a user I
30:28 - don't like the word user you know what
30:30 - the word is and this is not my idea I'm
30:32 - sort of pulling this from a talk or a
30:33 - presentation that Dan Pfeiffer who is a
30:36 - wonderful programmer and activist and
30:39 - person on the Internet
30:40 - people there people the people not users
30:44 - they're not users to manipulate and have
30:47 - make them use your stuff they're just
30:48 - people so this is the wheel that it's
30:52 - it's numbers so I've reduced people to
30:54 - numbers which is maybe a little bit
30:55 - reductive that's the word but these are
30:58 - all tied to a particular person viewer
31:03 - contribution and each time it's going to
31:06 - pick ten random ones and once it picks
31:09 - ten random ones I can now spin the wheel
31:12 - and it might be nice to see what the
31:15 - people's names are I can also do my
31:16 - little drum roll here I don't know what
31:20 - this one is number four who is number
31:22 - four passengers
31:26 - Thank You CJ passengers on the train you
31:29 - know the Train thing was just like I
31:31 - needed a name for this channel within
31:32 - like 24 hours it's like somebody's like
31:36 - I like that but I don't know that the
31:38 - idea of the Train theme has really come
31:40 - all from you know for me really this is
31:42 - really a channel about coding and and
31:44 - rainbows if I'm being perfectly honest I
31:46 - just want to put that out there just for
31:47 - a minute wouldn't put that out there
31:48 - okay
31:49 - back to this so I believe if I mug is
31:54 - blocking this but I believe now if I
31:57 - click this button remove and view
31:59 - selected it's going to take me to this
32:05 - so we picked
32:11 - ah here we go he picked item number for
32:15 - this the challenge this one is based on
32:18 - is Perlin noise Luke's and this was
32:20 - contributed by Maxime anakov alright
32:24 - overuse this now HBU it here you can
32:30 - open a new window Wow so I believe this
32:38 - challenge if I remember correctly was
32:39 - showing how to close a loop all the way
32:42 - around a circular path with the kind of
32:45 - the radius than any given angle being
32:47 - tied to Perlin noise and what's a nice
32:51 - application of that it looks like making
32:53 - like wobbly little Wiggly asteroids
32:56 - thingies in an asteroids game this is
32:58 - really good look out look how it
33:01 - labyrinth us is so I want to make this
33:03 - easy I'm gonna give myself three lives
33:06 - and I'm gonna start the more difficult
33:08 - than level the smaller number of lives
33:10 - the more points you get controlled by
33:12 - arrows press escape to return to the
33:14 - menu here we go wow this is great
33:24 - sorry I have to end my livestream now
33:26 - and spend the rest of the day playing
33:27 - this wouldn't it be fun to work on a bot
33:33 - an AI a little evolutionary algorithm to
33:37 - evolve a strategy for playing this game
33:40 - wonderful wonderful job thank you - I
33:43 - already forgot who this was Maxum man
33:47 - akov for this variation on parole annoys
33:51 - lips let's look at one more let's look
33:53 - at one more just I want to be
33:55 - conscientious about the time I do have
33:56 - some tutorials I want to do today so
33:59 - let's look at one more
34:00 - it's been the wheel
34:09 - number three this original challenge is
34:13 - blobby wow there's gonna feel life do
34:15 - you have a lot of challenges based on
34:17 - blob like shapes and it's created by
34:21 - Grilli 86 let's take a look and see oh
34:24 - there we go
34:25 - so this is nice ah so this looks like a
34:29 - pretty exact replica of my challenge if
34:32 - I remember it correctly I don't think I
34:33 - had this sort of changing color so it
34:35 - looks like what's been added here is
34:37 - that the color is changing according to
34:40 - maybe a noise algorithm but also it
34:42 - looks like if Ohno there's you know
34:45 - what's nice about this is seeing it on
34:47 - code pen and actually looking at the
34:49 - code looks like there's a bunch of other
34:51 - parameters that are changing and
34:52 - happening there's like lots more going
34:55 - on so this is really nice I mean this is
34:57 - actually oddly one of my favorite things
34:59 - to visualize it's just a kind of
35:01 - undulating gelatinous like shape things
35:04 - that are spongy that are soft or quite
35:06 - hard to do with code and very satisfying
35:09 - I think to play around with and and use
35:12 - okay great job that ends that segment
35:18 - you have segments now how's it going
35:25 - it's going very well thank you
35:31 - alright I'm gonna close these windows
35:34 - out I am I am a smart surface I am a
35:46 - smart surface people like me just you
35:54 - know daily affirmation nothing's wrong
35:55 - with little daily affirmation all right
35:59 - back over here so if you're wondering
36:01 - how to submit your own coding trained
36:05 - community version viewer person
36:07 - submitted passenger variant on a
36:10 - challenge go to the website and this is
36:15 - a link to add your own version and it's
36:16 - a little bit tricky you have to use the
36:20 - github website you have to you do
36:21 - something called a pull request
36:23 - but we are here we the coding trade
36:25 - community are here to be friendly and
36:27 - welcoming and help you through that
36:28 - process you can't do it wrong you can't
36:31 - break anything and even if you did break
36:33 - something that would be awesome
36:34 - if you can figure out how to break the
36:35 - website that would be fun and a learning
36:37 - experience for all of us so don't be shy
36:39 - if you think that your contribution
36:42 - isn't valuable you're wrong it is
36:44 - valuable please submit it and I even
36:47 - have a video I think that goes through
36:48 - this like community contribution coding
36:52 - train I just google that there we go how
36:55 - to add your contribution to the coding
36:56 - train website so this video hopefully
36:58 - give you a little more context all right
37:04 - did I plug my cat Instagram yet today
37:08 - all right so here's what here's what we
37:11 - got I've got a little over an hour and
37:12 - I'm a three more things I am going to do
37:15 - a quick tutorial on oh I'm gonna do I'm
37:23 - gonna look at the you net model in ml
37:26 - five let's do a daily challenge on
37:28 - brilliant org and then I'm gonna look at
37:30 - body pics in ml five that's what's
37:32 - happening for the rest of this
37:33 - livestream today so give me a second
37:36 - here to get set up for the next bit
37:40 - [Music]
37:49 - [Music]

40:37 - [Music]
40:45 - [Music]
40:53 - alright by the way I've been seeing this
40:57 - warning / error a lot recently and I
41:00 - don't know what it is a cookie
41:02 - associated with a cross-site resource at
41:05 - cloud fair comm was set without the same
41:08 - site attribute why is this appearing cuz
41:12 - I have something to do with loading the
41:13 - P 5 library from the CDN
41:16 - oh it's Klis must be right because
41:17 - that's cloud fair no more warning huh so
41:24 - is this what is this I don't want to get
41:27 - off-track here but I'm wondering is this
41:30 - an issue with cloud fair with the p5 web
41:34 - editor who knows right somebody can
41:41 - write to me or I probably might not see
41:42 - it in the chat right now but we movie
41:44 - can somebody can help me with this in
41:45 - slack I see Alka is typing and I'm
41:47 - almost certainly certain the answer is
41:48 - about to come but this is not an error
41:54 - that I'm super familiar with so I want
41:55 - to do this tutorial not in the p5 web
41:58 - editor because I'm not super familiar
42:00 - I haven't actually this is a thing that
42:03 - I do which is I make tutorials and stuff
42:05 - I haven't used just right off the cuff
42:08 - why not but I'm not super familiar I
42:12 - haven't really done a lot of work with
42:13 - this unit function so I I think
42:16 - debugging it or figuring out what's
42:17 - going on might be a little easier in the
42:19 - browser you can close the what's new
42:22 - a part of the console I did that I'm not
42:24 - so sure about the cookie area yeah okay
42:26 - all right so one thing I can do it at a
42:31 - minimum is I can tell it to not show my
42:33 - warnings so I'm going to just take this
42:37 - off and then we won't see the warnings
42:39 - all right so what do I need I want a
42:43 - couple things before I start this
42:45 - tutorial
42:46 - I want the ml5 website closed the web
42:50 - editor I want to reference so I'm going
42:57 - to spell this wrong but I'm hoping
42:58 - Google will help me is Syed's github and
43:03 - Twitter and website Alley FBI maybe
43:14 - somebody could help me who's watching I
43:16 - should have asked Sayid this am i
43:18 - pronouncing this within the realm of
43:20 - reasonableness for a silly American and
43:24 - I am xayide
43:25 - of up alley Fi Syed Ali fi and somebody
43:30 - help me with this so um while I'm
43:33 - waiting for maybe the chat to help me
43:34 - with pronunciation Adam asked unit are
43:38 - you going to do some segmentation yes so
43:41 - I am here to demonstrate how to use a
43:45 - pre trained image segmentation model
43:48 - which has the unit architecture in the
43:50 - ml5 genis library so this is not a
43:52 - tutorial on the unit architecture coding
43:55 - it from scratch with you know tensorflow
43:58 - and c++ I'm really just using a very
44:00 - high level tool to have a pre trained
44:02 - model and sort of look at image
44:04 - segmentation in in ml 5 GS okay
44:18 - okay let me see if I can well thank you
44:24 - I got some sort of super Chad thing from
44:26 - Christopher Jessa thank you make me feel
44:33 - very odd we're not comfortable but I get
44:36 - slave I appreciate it
44:37 - Oh bro train whistle oh that's very kind
44:42 - of you it very much appreciated it's
44:44 - more like zayeed
44:47 - so did I get that right armor xayide yes
44:56 - I people area what all right do coding
45:00 - challenges holy Jessup I'm reading the
45:02 - chat I was looking for something here I
45:05 - was gonna make some people moderators
45:06 - but okay I did notice it's just that it
45:15 - takes me it take some time right you
45:17 - what you don't understand
45:18 - I mean sometimes I don't notice but you
45:20 - just really have to be aware there's
45:21 - quite a significant delay in what you're
45:24 - seeing me versus the real time of the
45:26 - chat so well anything that I respond to
45:28 - in the chat HAP you won't see it for at
45:30 - least 30 seconds all right okay xayide
45:37 - okay
45:44 - okay here we go and like join you just
45:48 - cycle the cameras are they gonna shut
45:49 - off
45:49 - it's 10:30 I've got an hour here so I
45:51 - think we're in good shape and here all
46:00 - right hello and welcome to another
46:04 - tutorial part of the beginner's guide to
46:06 - machine learning in JavaScript with ml 5
46:09 - GS
46:09 - so in today's tutorial I want to talk
46:11 - about a particular I think you can hear
46:20 - that yes you can hear that yes I'll just
46:30 - start over but I almost feel like I want
46:32 - to keep that kind of sort of funny hello
46:37 - and welcome to another video as part of
46:39 - the beginner's guide to machine learning
46:42 - in JavaScript with ml v GS so in today's
46:44 - in this particular video I want to look
46:46 - at something called image segmentation
46:57 - I have a whiteboard I'm just looking at
47:09 - how well you can see that so what do I
47:16 - mean by image segmentation so right now
47:18 - you're looking at an image of me and
47:20 - there are different parts of the image
47:22 - that we as human beings could dissect or
47:24 - deconstruct so let me try to do a very
47:27 - poor job of drawing a version of this
47:30 - myself
47:31 - and maybe there's also sort of this so I
47:34 - could think of this image as having
47:36 - different segments different parts
47:38 - there's my head there's my body there is
47:43 - the background which is maybe a wall and
47:48 - then there's actually a sort of
47:49 - secondary wall over here that's the wall
47:52 - to my right and this is the wall to my
47:54 - left I could even think of that as
47:55 - another segment so in this case I have
47:58 - full I'm just decided this video has
48:00 - four segments a B C and D and in a way
48:05 - this is ultimately a classification
48:07 - problem what I'm doing is I'm looking at
48:10 - every single one of these pixels in this
48:12 - image and trying to classify it as one
48:15 - of four possible labels and you could
48:18 - imagine how this could be useful maybe
48:20 - you want a computer vision Pete software
48:22 - to be able to find all the pixels that
48:25 - are cars on the road that are flowers in
48:29 - a garden there's so many possibilities
48:30 - here and so this is there there are so
48:39 - many possibilities here and there are a
48:41 - couple function there what am I trying
48:44 - to say here looks like there's a third
48:47 - segment I don't know what's going on
48:54 - there are a lot of possible applications
48:56 - of this so the there's a much longer
48:58 - story to how you might collect a data
49:01 - set that is labeled and segmented train
49:05 - a model to recognize image segmentation
49:06 - and maybe this is something that I can
49:08 - do a deeper dive into in future videos
49:10 - but in this video I want to start with a
49:13 - particular segmentation model that is
49:17 - trained on faces what it is yeah I think
49:24 - its face and really just dip that's
49:31 - trained on faces and really just
49:33 - differentiates the image into one of two
49:36 - categories
49:36 - it's the foreground or in the background
49:38 - it's the human face or it's not part of
49:40 - the human face and this is a quick way
49:41 - to do masking or other types of things
49:44 - that you might want to do in an
49:46 - interactive media application the
49:51 - architecture of this particular model is
49:53 - something called u net and u net I will
49:57 - include a link to I will include links
50:00 - to more resources about what the unit
50:02 - architecture is if you want to get lower
50:04 - level with this but this is a
50:06 - particularly Sheen learning architecture
50:08 - that was designed and invented for
50:11 - medical imaging so you could imagine how
50:13 - image segmentation could be useful with
50:17 - medical images if you're trying to pull
50:19 - out different parts of the anatomy or
50:20 - recognize certain aspects of the human
50:23 - body what else do I want to say about
50:26 - this
50:35 - wait there's another super chat this is
50:40 - crazy
50:43 - Christopher Jessup
50:45 - oh it just says it twice hopefully
50:47 - that's not a mistake turning like bright
50:56 - red here alright okay if you're looking
51:08 - for data sets that are available to the
51:10 - public with training data for image
51:13 - segmentation a very well-known one is
51:15 - called cocoa or common objects in
51:19 - context what's the how does that make
51:23 - cocoa common objects in context wouldn't
51:26 - that be C oh I see time-wise where are
51:32 - we okay
51:34 - common objects in context Oh
51:38 - context is C oh I got it figured it out
51:46 - the cocoa data set are common objects in
51:50 - context can you see this it gets really
51:55 - bright as I get closer here the white
51:58 - balance is a problem oh well so in the
52:04 - next video I'm actually going to look at
52:06 - a particular image segmentation model
52:08 - called body pics which you can start to
52:11 - think about is how that must have some
52:13 - similarity with this face unit model and
52:17 - this particular model was trained off of
52:19 - the cocoa dataset but let me talk to you
52:21 - about the unit model that's in ml 5 the
52:25 - one pre-trained model that's there and
52:27 - how it was trained and who trained it
52:28 - and who contributed this to ml 5 okay
52:34 - Christopher says it's not a mistake
52:36 - yeah thank you but and I I appreciate
52:39 - that it's the last one for today okay
52:42 - all right so
52:47 - hold on I just want to
53:02 - Sayyid the pre-trained model the
53:05 - pre-trained unit model that's in ml5 for
53:07 - you to use was trained by a researcher
53:09 - named Syed out of all efi let me say
53:11 - that one more time because i feel very
53:13 - awkward about it
53:14 - the pre-trained model that's available
53:17 - for you to use in ml5 was trained by a
53:19 - researcher names ie Syed Ali Fi and you
53:22 - can find out more about Saeed Saeed the
53:37 - restraint the the pre trained model
53:40 - that's in ml5 that you can experiment
53:42 - with was trained by researchers ie alia
53:46 - fine and and Zayed you can find out more
53:48 - about him from Twitter page github and
53:51 - also a website and include links to all
53:53 - those in the video's description I do
53:55 - want to point out here that this
53:58 - particular model was trained from this
54:00 - data set and I haven't done I haven't
54:03 - looked in depth at this particular data
54:05 - set it is a face head segmentation data
54:08 - set but if you look at these images you
54:10 - might notice something sort of strange
54:12 - about them I believe that this is a data
54:15 - set that was created through 3d
54:17 - simulation and I you know maybe some of
54:19 - you enterprising viewers could look into
54:22 - this more and and provide some
54:25 - commentary in the comments I mean I can
54:26 - come back in a future video and look at
54:28 - this data set a bit more but there's
54:29 - always a lot of complicated issues
54:31 - around collecting data of people's faces
54:33 - and making sure that you have a
54:35 - representative sample are you collecting
54:37 - those faces with people's permission in
54:39 - general I might say if you're collecting
54:41 - people's faces maybe you just shouldn't
54:42 - be doing that but this is one approach
54:44 - to doing so by I'm looking at the chat
54:51 - and the super chat is going off the
54:52 - rails but hearing but this is this is
54:57 - one technique of doing it because also
54:59 - even if you get real images you're going
55:02 - to have to hand label them somehow but
55:03 - if you're simulating the faces and then
55:05 - creating the segmentation maps this is
55:08 - the training data so this was the
55:10 - training data that zayeed used to train
55:13 - that model with the u net
55:15 - Oh texture let me let me offer a quick
55:22 - few thank-yous here oh those were all
55:28 - Christopher chips okay thank you thank
55:31 - you thank you
55:34 - I'm your train whistle blowing person
55:38 - here and then also thank you to Andrey
55:40 - Kay Lopez wah thank you so much very
55:42 - kind of you
55:44 - this really allows me the the support
55:47 - really allows me to have allocate more
55:49 - time to doing this to bring more people
55:51 - into the community and I hope that I'm
55:54 - doing everything in the best way that I
55:56 - can all right now let's look at the
56:06 - reference for this unit model in ml 5
56:09 - and try to build a quick example that
56:11 - does the actual image segmentation
56:13 - remember we're not training the model
56:15 - we're not creating our own image
56:17 - segmentation model which is making use
56:18 - of one that somebody else trained and
56:20 - applying it in the browser with the ML
56:22 - 5gs library so first the first thing
56:25 - I'll do is I'll go here on to reference
56:26 - and I'm going to look for yo sorry I'm
56:31 - going to look for a unit right here and
56:35 - whoa amazing so first of all a website
56:39 - is totally like an active process of
56:42 - changing and being updated oh wait where
56:45 - am I even am I even on the website cuz I
56:50 - went to here reference oh yeah it's
56:52 - taking me to kid up dot I hope this is
56:54 - crazy
56:55 - like I think Joey Lee who's one of the
56:58 - leaners of ml5 Jas it's been working on
57:01 - the website quite a bit it looks
57:03 - completely different than what I've used
57:04 - to which I think it's fine this is
57:06 - making it fun so here I'm on the website
57:12 - I'm going to go down to you net looks
57:14 - like there's a placeholder image right
57:16 - now let's quickly go to acknowledgments
57:25 - it's kind of look can I get to the old
57:29 - website just for the purpose of this
57:31 - video let's just see for a second I
57:33 - think what if I change this to ml 5 j s
57:38 - dot work force it to do that
57:42 - nope no no that's PR g yeah all right
57:55 - I'm just gonna I'm gonna live with this
57:58 - right now and the construction noise
58:02 - always the construction noise how am i
58:06 - doing timewise okay not so bad
58:10 - could be worse okay thank you too rough
58:20 - sue Betar as well Wow
58:23 - all right usage so I'm not gonna worry
58:28 - about going into the reference in detail
58:32 - I'm just going to
58:43 - we'll cut to this when we make the
58:45 - tutorial
59:01 - please do a video about I don't know
59:05 - what that is I'm gonna have to look up
59:07 - what that is all right let me just let
59:16 - me take a picture support open-source
59:17 - software development there's lots of
59:20 - wonderful projects out there that could
59:21 - use your support as well as me thank you
59:30 - first thing I want to do is navigate
59:32 - over to the ml 5gs web page the
59:35 - reference page for the U net model now
59:37 - the you know I should be clear her unit
59:39 - is unit is a machine learning
59:42 - architecture there's no I should be
59:56 - first thing I want to do is Maz is
59:59 - navigate over to the ml 5 jazz website
60:01 - and look for the unit reference page so
60:04 - on the reference page also find some
60:06 - information about the about the
60:08 - background behind this functionality in
60:10 - ml 5 as well as sort of like a
60:12 - QuickStart guide for what the basics of
60:14 - code works at code how the code works
60:16 - and any more stuff so what will be clear
60:18 - here is that you net is the machine is
60:20 - them is the model architecture so on its
60:22 - own it isn't anything but zayeed trained
60:26 - a model based on phases so in ml 5 to
60:28 - access that pre-trained modeling it's
60:30 - the only one right now in the future
60:31 - there might be more that you could put
60:33 - in here you'll say ml 5 dot unit face
60:36 - so let's actually start putting that
60:37 - into our code so um this is what I have
60:40 - so far I have a p5 sketch that loads the
60:43 - video from the webcam you can see the
60:45 - green screen here and it's displaying it
60:46 - here and then I'm redrawing into the
60:48 - canvas so what I also want to do is draw
60:49 - the segmentation here and see and see
60:52 - the original video here so I'll go back
60:55 - to the code a couple things to mention
60:56 - is um got to make sure you have in
60:58 - addition to importing the p5 library you
61:00 - have the ml 5 library important as well
61:02 - and now I can go over and start to edit
61:04 - sketch da yes so back to the reference
61:07 - page I want to say this and most likely
61:12 - let's just see if this works
61:15 - I think I want to try to load the model
61:17 - with preload let's see if that works
61:20 - and then let's just try and set up let's
61:24 - try console logging of the model to see
61:26 - if it's been loaded great so this looks
61:33 - promising model ready is true so again
61:36 - you can load the model asynchronously
61:38 - with a callback and there's a variety of
61:40 - different ways of doing it but a quick
61:41 - way to get started in p5 s use the
61:43 - preload function to make sure the model
61:45 - is loaded before it starts so that's
61:47 - awesome the next thing that I want to do
61:49 - probably is call I'm guessing call a
61:51 - function like segment I want to say hey
61:54 - I'm a machine learning model the input
61:56 - is an image the output is the segmented
61:59 - version of the image right here this
62:02 - video of me is the input I'm gonna feed
62:05 - that into the model the output is some
62:07 - kind of image map of colors it's very
62:16 - hard to do these tutorials and handle
62:17 - the super chat at the same time but I'm
62:19 - so appreciative david schneider writes
62:22 - the tuner contribution worked out of the
62:24 - box because i put some extra code to
62:26 - make sure it would aha so there is so
62:29 - I'll be curious take a look at it some
62:30 - extra code to make sure that the audio
62:32 - starts I know I don't have to super chat
62:34 - but I wanted to thank you all right
62:39 - yes Simon I did see your message on the
62:40 - random number generator thank you I and
62:43 - also if I miss the messages I always go
62:45 - back and look at them later especially
62:46 - in the slack so don't worry too much
62:48 - okay hard for me to catch everything
62:53 - while I'm live-streaming go back to the
63:00 - reference we can see ah there is a
63:03 - function just like I thought called
63:05 - segment I'm going to give it the input
63:07 - the video and then there's going to be a
63:09 - callback when it's done processing
63:10 - that's going to be in the result so I'm
63:13 - going to lazily just copy all of this
63:17 - and I'm going to put it here and set up
63:22 - actually mmm now let's try this let's
63:26 - see what happens I'm gonna put the
63:28 - didn't set up I'm gonna take this got
63:29 - result function and put it up here I'm
63:32 - gonna add the semicolons because I
63:34 - cannot live without semicolons and let's
63:37 - just see if I get either an error or a
63:41 - result all right let's see what happens
63:48 - this is promising looks like I got
63:51 - something I got a blob with this size
63:54 - that's of type image I also got an image
63:57 - and I also got a raw and I got a tensor
64:00 - so this is what ml 5 does ml 5 anytime
64:05 - you anytime you process data through one
64:10 - of its machine learning models it's
64:12 - going to give you all of the results
64:14 - back in a variety of different formats
64:16 - depending on what it is you might try to
64:18 - do so here a clue to what I wanted to is
64:22 - the fact that one of these is a p5 dot
64:24 - image so for me I just want to like look
64:26 - at the image I just want to draw it just
64:27 - want to see it but there's also a blob
64:30 - which is a sort of native JavaScript
64:33 - data for the image there's also this raw
64:37 - which is probably just the raw numbers
64:39 - an array of all the numbers that define
64:41 - that all the pixels that map of the
64:43 - segments and then a tensor which is even
64:45 - lower level again ml 5 is built on top
64:47 - of tensor flow and a tensor is a
64:50 - basically collection of numbers that
64:52 - tensorflow j s is managing to throw out
64:55 - the machine learning process so I think
64:57 - if I just here say image result dot
65:01 - image this is going to draw it into the
65:04 - window I'm gonna comment out the draw
65:07 - loop because I don't want to see that
65:09 - right now and I'm going to hit refresh
65:11 - so I should have seen the video down
65:13 - here oh whoops I have an error image was
65:18 - expecting three arguments I need to say
65:20 - where to draw the image so let's just
65:22 - put it at 0 0 try again
65:29 - I don't see anything so why don't I see
65:34 - anything I have a feeling that first of
65:37 - all I only asked the segment at once and
65:38 - I asked it immediately at the start of
65:40 - the program I know the model was loaded
65:42 - but was the video ready so most likely I
65:44 - think something that's going to be
65:45 - better here is for me to actually use a
65:48 - callback right now with the video I'm
65:50 - gonna say video ready I'm gonna add a
65:53 - function called video ready and then
65:55 - there that's when I will call segment so
66:00 - let's see if that gives me something
66:01 - more useful some waiting videos ready
66:07 - well it definitely got the results so
66:21 - here's my suspicion now the video is
66:23 - ready but the very first frame of the
66:26 - video doesn't really have anything in it
66:27 - because it takes a like a bit for it to
66:30 - like warm up I really have no idea I
66:31 - think what could be more effective here
66:33 - is for me to continuously call segments
66:36 - right every time I get maybe what I
66:38 - should have done to demonstrate this was
66:39 - use a static image not just start with
66:41 - the webcam feed but that's what I'm
66:43 - doing here it's also I realized this web
66:45 - this is an interesting webcam feed
66:46 - because you have to remember here this
66:48 - is not a typical image right what was it
66:51 - trained on it was trained on for saw
66:53 - simulated images of people wandering
66:55 - through a 3d world and I don't think
66:58 - they were all standing in front of a
66:59 - green screen so will this even work with
67:00 - me dimpling you would think like
67:01 - segmenting in front of a green screen is
67:03 - the easiest thing you don't need was she
67:04 - learning for that cuz you could just
67:05 - look at pixel colors that's what's
67:06 - happening right now that's I'm making
67:07 - this video so much to think about here
67:10 - all right
67:18 - I think what I can add here is that once
67:20 - I've got the result I'm draw the image
67:22 - let me ask the segment again so I'm just
67:25 - going to copy paste this right here and
67:28 - this should in essence loop it over and
67:30 - over again segment the image get the
67:33 - result segmented again get the results
67:35 - segmented again Wow
67:48 - what have I done wrong let's look at the
67:59 - example whoops
68:08 - let's look at the example see if this
68:14 - works oh oh it's nice that there's a
68:19 - link here but it doesn't actually go
68:20 - there lets me try to find the example in
68:29 - the web editor does anybody see you net
68:37 - in here pose net Yolo all right let's
68:46 - take more drastic measures oh here we go
68:51 - oh no interesting all right let's just
69:01 - for a quick second here let's just
69:05 - replace the code with the example yeah
69:12 - okay so it does work that's a good sign
69:16 - what did I do wrong
69:23 - oh I didn't know I did
69:39 - this looks very similar I mean I'm just
69:42 - drawing in a different place but
69:58 - what
70:17 - it's a video input the right no so um
70:19 - this is a great question
70:21 - TMC is asking is the video input the
70:26 - right size and nl5
70:28 - I should address this but ml5 is
70:29 - handling that segmented image let me
70:41 - just try doing this in draw I mean
70:45 - oh maybe what comes out is no what did I
70:50 - do wrong I'm just like looking at this
70:52 - example right create capture size high
70:58 - that doesn't matter I mean there's this
70:59 - but this really shouldn't matter like I
71:04 - don't need to store it oh no I need to
71:07 - copy it it shouldn't matter like this is
71:12 - exactly what I'm doing it's just drawing
71:17 - it in a different place all right let's
71:25 - well I'm running out of time here
71:31 - [Music]
71:32 - all right I'm gonna I don't see how this
71:35 - matters but let's
71:38 - [Music]
71:44 - oh wait nobody took that out yeah
71:56 - is there some kind of weird like order
72:00 - of operations that like drawing inside
72:03 - of this got result is such a problem
72:31 - Oh weird huh so why why does drawing
72:42 - it's actually not ready weird new member
72:49 - Eckert
72:50 - hello but I don't have draw so I can't
72:55 - be drawing over it why
73:09 - yeah I mean I could do I can draw in
73:14 - here right like what if I say background
73:16 - this is gonna flicker I'll just do
73:18 - Freight I won't frame count modulus 255
73:21 - Oh No
73:27 - oh but there's no frame count but like I
73:29 - can draw in there weird I honestly don't
73:37 - understand but interestingly enough it's
73:39 - like the image isn't ready or something
73:44 - draw and draw and draw I mean drawing
73:46 - and draw is a better better practice
73:48 - anyway so I think I'm just gonna have to
73:50 - cop to that let me go back to me not
73:55 - having it working
74:21 - all right this is where it wasn't
74:23 - working oh whoa oh because I have this
74:33 - all right I'm just gonna go back to here
74:44 - this is a bit odd to me but it seems
74:46 - like I think what's going on here is
74:48 - drawing inside of this got result
74:50 - function is problematic ultimately if I
74:53 - want to draw into the canvas in an
74:56 - animation using p5 s draw loop is the
74:59 - place to do it I should be able to do it
75:01 - here I mean there's something with the
75:02 - image isn't ready to be drawn I really
75:03 - don't know what's going on if I'm being
75:05 - perfectly honest maybe somebody will
75:06 - reveal it in the comments but looking at
75:09 - the the way the actual ml5 example is
75:11 - written yeah I think a more thoughtful
75:13 - way if I create a separate variable
75:16 - that's like a segmented image and I just
75:19 - start at the beginning as a blank image
75:24 - so let me just make a blank image that's
75:27 - the same size of the window and then
75:29 - what I can do here instead of trying to
75:31 - draw the image here I can just set that
75:35 - particular variable segmented image
75:37 - equal to result on image and then what I
75:40 - can do is I can add the draw function
75:42 - and in draw just draw that segmented
75:46 - image at 0 0 I mean it should already be
75:50 - the correct size of the canvas so let's
75:52 - see what happens now I'm gonna hit
75:54 - refresh there we go ah interesting so
75:58 - look so it's there it looks different
76:01 - though right it's a different size than
76:03 - the original image so first of all a
76:05 - machine learning model has to have a
76:08 - fixed size set of inputs and a fixed
76:11 - size set of outputs not I mean there's
76:12 - exceptions to this but certainly in the
76:14 - case of a kind of traditional model
76:17 - that's expecting images it's expecting
76:19 - images of a certain resolution which is
76:20 - probably not 320 by 240 so ml5 is
76:24 - adjusting the resolution of the image
76:25 - before it feeds it into this unit face
76:28 - model and then when it comes out though
76:29 - it comes out in the sort of default
76:31 - resolution but I can just if I want it
76:34 - to match up visually I can just rescale
76:36 - it when I draw it like this and now
76:39 - we're seeing that I have the original
76:42 - video here and then the segmented image
76:44 - here so this doesn't look too thrilling
76:46 - because I have a green screen behind me
76:48 - but let's see if I can move the webcam
76:50 - to somewhere else in this room and see
76:51 - what happens all right you can see
76:55 - actually actually I don't know if I want
76:56 - to you can see this is my like streaming
76:58 - wherever there now it's starting to like
77:00 - lose track of what's going on but here
77:02 - it's still working now as I get over
77:04 - here it thinks that's part of my face so
77:06 - again what was the training data what
77:08 - what kind of environments was it was it
77:10 - trained in how well is it doing that
77:11 - segmentation but here you can do some
77:14 - basic background removal let's just see
77:17 - let's just very quickly see if I can
77:19 - replace replace my background using a
77:23 - unit model as a starting point so how
77:26 - would I do that like for example if I
77:32 - say this the the pixels are actually
77:41 - black and so how do I make that an alpha
77:49 - Channel I could process the image right
77:57 - it's probably in the raw data there's a
78:03 - what did we say was in the this thing
78:06 - there's the blob there's the image
78:08 - there's the raw which is all the pixel
78:13 - information so I could probably write ah
78:19 - so I could see I mean that's
78:22 - wherever there's black I could replace I
78:25 - can make that the Alpha so one way of
78:30 - doing that would be to make the Alpha
78:32 - Channel of the image but they're like
78:37 - I'm there's a mask function in p5
78:53 - I'll just just bear with me for a second
78:56 - can i well maybe I don't want to go down
79:04 - this road additive blending would ignore
79:06 - black yeah I think I'm I think I'm kind
79:09 - of brown a time here I want to do body
79:15 - pics and I want to do the brilliant
79:16 - challenge I do have I'm just trying to
79:19 - think I know I'm trying to think there's
79:21 - a smarter way to do this and let's look
79:25 - at the let's look at them reference
79:40 - there's a mask function I thought yeah a
79:46 - photo mask mask image so I should be
79:49 - able to use it as a mask I'm just
79:52 - curious like what if I create just give
79:57 - me a second here
80:20 - let's draw
80:25 - just can't cure us in here
80:31 - so that's good and then
80:48 - wait
81:04 - I will explain what I'm doing in a
81:06 - second
81:14 - okay that's a good sign oh no it's not a
81:18 - good sign
81:26 - photo mask source image last party
81:31 - mission is playing by loading in late Oh
81:33 - it uses the Alpha channel as an alpha
81:36 - channel for this image okay I'm gonna
81:38 - have to process I'm gonna have to
81:40 - process the pixels I'm gonna have to
81:46 - process the pixels I mean I think maybe
81:48 - I don't want to get into this right now
81:50 - because I'm gonna move on but I think
81:56 - what I could do here is I could I maybe
82:03 - I'll come back in a separate video and
82:05 - do something about that or think about
82:07 - how that would be useful it really
82:09 - should that really should be I think it
82:11 - should probably give you the image not
82:13 - with I think ml 5 should practically
82:16 - probably change this it should probably
82:17 - put set the Alpha value to zero so Leben
82:25 - I'm actually gonna do this let me do
82:27 - this real quick so let me show you what
82:31 - I mean
82:40 - let me just go back to what I had before
82:42 - and then get rid of this other stuff
83:01 - one of the things you first might want
83:02 - to do with this I think I just said this
83:05 - where one of the things you first might
83:06 - want to do with this is then actually
83:08 - like replace the background behind you
83:10 - so for example I could load a nice beach
83:11 - scene or something but just to simulate
83:13 - that let me put blue behind me so in
83:17 - other words if I said background 0 0 0
83:21 - 255
83:22 - I should see myself right now in front
83:24 - of this blue background but I don't so
83:28 - what ml5 has actually returned to me is
83:31 - an image segmented but each the the
83:34 - background pixels are colored black
83:36 - rather than having their transparency
83:40 - for example set to zero so I'm not sure
83:42 - maybe this should be something that ml 5
83:44 - actually offers and maybe by the time
83:45 - you watch this this will have changed
83:48 - but for right now I could at least
83:49 - iterate over the pixels and anytime
83:51 - there's a pixel that with color 0 0 0 I
83:54 - could set its alpha down to 0 and there
83:56 - might be some fancier way to do this
83:57 - with like a blend mode or something
83:58 - but let me just see if I can process the
84:00 - pixels this way I'm gonna do this
84:02 - quickly right here what I'm going to do
84:19 - I'm gonna look right here where I am
84:22 - receiving that segmented image I am
84:26 - going to loop over and I'm gonna do a
84:29 - nested loop I think actually no I don't
84:32 - need to all right I'm gonna look right
84:41 - here where I'm receiving that segmented
84:43 - image and I'm going to iterate all over
84:44 - all the pixels so I'm gonna use a for
84:46 - loop to go over segmented image pixels
84:50 - length I plus plus oh I'm gonna say I
84:54 - plus equals four because in p5.js the
84:58 - array of pixels there are four spots in
85:01 - the array for every single pixel are G B
85:04 - a so I can say the r-value is segmented
85:13 - image pixels index I I'm gonna use a
85:15 - plus a zero here you'll see why in a
85:17 - second that's the red value that's the G
85:20 - the G value is plus one the B value is
85:24 - +2 they're all right next to each other
85:25 - RGB then the alpha value is what I want
85:29 - to set so I'm gonna say if R equals zero
85:33 - and G equals zero can I do this and B
85:39 - equals zero so this is gonna let me do
85:41 - that then I want to say images pixels I
85:45 - plus three I'm just gonna set the Alpha
85:48 - down to zero and I should probably say
85:51 - segmented image load pixels seg minted
85:57 - image update pixels and let's see what
86:03 - happens I'm gonna hit refresh I have the
86:05 - blue background I'm gonna see myself
86:10 - oh no J pixels
86:26 - this is gonna make the console go crazy
86:31 - just one whoops that's weird
86:43 - Oh Oh not I yeah no I let me get rid of
86:49 - this console.log
86:55 - it's only getting that for the zero
86:57 - pixel all the other pixels are
87:14 - and this is an awful thing I'm about to
87:16 - do because it's gonna spit out a zillion
87:20 - things but let's just see what happens
87:29 - it's only oh look at this this is like a
87:41 - bug I'm like discovering a really weird
87:43 - bug in ml5 or something which is that
87:48 - the image is not available yet it
87:49 - doesn't have any pixels like that's why
87:51 - I couldn't draw it here it's like not
87:53 - actually ready this is so weird this is
87:58 - what happens on the coding train I think
88:00 - I'm gonna do this like very simple
88:01 - tutorial and it all goes wrong but watch
88:04 - this I have a feeling now I might have
88:08 - to come back and I'll redo this or like
88:11 - fill in the gap on Thursday this week if
88:14 - I do it like I've been feeling if I do
88:16 - it here in draw boy see there we go now
88:21 - I've already done a horrible thing I've
88:25 - killed he'll stop go away browser
88:39 - I did what I didn't want to do which is
88:42 - I put a for loop in the I put a console
88:48 - lock inside my pixel for loop which is
88:50 - like the worst thing ever just please
88:53 - stop get to the end get to the end
88:57 - clothes clothes can I oh there's like a
88:59 - task manager right
89:01 - task manager can I get which tab is this
89:10 - it's got to be this one end process
89:12 - there we go
89:27 - no it's still printing oh I didn't
89:32 - commented out task manager there we go
89:42 - and
89:55 - friends don't let friends put a
89:59 - console.log in a for-loop of pixels
90:04 - there we go
90:07 - weird so unbelievably weird okay I might
90:17 - have to like figure out why this is
90:20 - happening but wor this tutorial is just
90:24 - gonna be you know what I'm gonna do I'm
90:35 - just gonna do this again but I'll just
90:36 - do it in draw and I will ignore I'm
90:42 - gonna do this little little bit again
90:44 - everybody please bear with me as you
90:47 - always do
90:59 - one of the first things you're probably
91:01 - thinking of to do is oh I could now
91:02 - replace the background to something else
91:04 - I could put myself in a lovely beach
91:05 - scene over the garden of flowers behind
91:07 - me instead of just this green wall or
91:09 - whatever happens to be the actual
91:11 - background so the to do that you might
91:14 - think okay let me let me just let me
91:16 - just replace it with blue just as a test
91:18 - I'm gonna say background 0 0 255 I'm
91:22 - gonna hit refresh
91:23 - this looks good I've got blue I've got
91:25 - the image and now up it's still black
91:28 - pixels not blue so the kind of image
91:32 - that's actually being returned into that
91:33 - segmented image doesn't have any
91:35 - transparency to it the pixels that are
91:37 - part of the background are classified as
91:39 - background as essentially and then given
91:41 - the color of RGB 0 0 0 so maybe there's
91:44 - a different way that ml5 maybe there's a
91:46 - way I could use it as an alpha mask or
91:48 - some kind of blend mode I leave that to
91:50 - the comments to give me some excellent
91:52 - suggestions about it think of it this is
91:53 - a better way but what I'm gonna do right
91:55 - now is just manually process the pixels
91:57 - so for example here and draw I can just
91:59 - say segmented image load pixels then I'm
92:05 - gonna also say segmented image update
92:07 - pixels and what I'll do is I'm going to
92:10 - do a for loop I'm gonna start at 0 I'm
92:13 - gonna go all the way to a segmented
92:16 - image pixels dot length and then what do
92:22 - I want to do I'm gonna look at the red
92:23 - value which is segmented pixels index I
92:27 - uh wait so one thing I forgot is in P
92:31 - 5gs or in JavaScript if you're looking
92:33 - at an image the pixel array has four
92:37 - spots for every pixel red green blue
92:39 - alpha in that order so red is pixels
92:43 - plus zero and this should actually go up
92:45 - by four for every pixel gee red green
92:51 - blue plus one for green plus two for
92:55 - blue and then when I want to set the
92:56 - alpha I can say if R equals zero and G
93:03 - is zero and B is zero this is probably a
93:06 - more elegant way of doing that I can say
93:08 - I can set the Alpha value to zero
93:12 - so let's see what happens now if I hit
93:14 - refresh I have the blue background I
93:16 - have the segmented image and I have
93:18 - there we go me in front of a blue
93:20 - background you know I could do some
93:24 - other things here like for example if I
93:28 - wanted to just make this more of a
93:29 - silhouette now I have the opportunity of
93:32 - saying something like I could actually
93:35 - replace all of these do this quickly
93:47 - something like this and now I'm going to
93:51 - see myself here and just kind of a
93:54 - silhouette version of myself up here and
93:56 - there's some flickering going on again I
93:58 - I think I've got more to think about
94:00 - this maybe I need to come back with a
94:01 - follow-up video there's some weirdness
94:03 - going on with the fact that I'm getting
94:06 - the segmented image in this got result
94:09 - callback and then manipulating it and
94:11 - drawing it in the draw loop and the
94:13 - order of how those things happen could
94:15 - call it appears to be maybe causing some
94:18 - issues here so thank you for watching
94:21 - this gif give Z you net a pre-trained
94:23 - face model a try make something with it
94:26 - and be on the lookout for app in the
94:29 - comment or a follow-up video that maybe
94:30 - irons out some of these like little
94:32 - issues with cleaning up this order of
94:35 - operations in this program okay thanks
94:37 - for watching and I'll see you soon good
94:38 - bye yes so copper Francis asking does
94:49 - this work without a green background
94:50 - this is pretty unfortunate that I have
94:52 - doing this with a green background
94:54 - because it gives the illusion of doing
94:57 - some kind of chroma keying effect which
94:58 - I could easily do just with pixel
95:00 - manipulation but yeah alright so choo
95:05 - choo to the chat I'm gonna close some
95:11 - stuff out here and I want to say thank
95:14 - you to the coding trains livestream
95:17 - sponsor brilliant org I this
95:20 - unfortunately it's like fired here
95:23 - instantly but I'll put this in the chat
95:25 - you should go to brilliant dot board
95:29 - slash coding train no the okay so I'm
95:34 - gonna take that off the screen since
95:36 - it's incorrect and I am going to go talk
95:39 - to you about brilliant org so I
95:40 - mentioned earlier that one of the things
95:43 - that I'm doing now is I'm doing coding
95:46 - challenges from a new secret location
95:48 - soon to be launched on the coding train
95:51 - Oh video coming out hopefully later this
95:54 - week preview to members and I one of the
95:58 - ways that I come up with ideas and keep
96:01 - my mind fresh and continue learning for
96:04 - new coding challenges that I want to
96:05 - work on or things that I want to teach
96:07 - in my classes is by the internet and I
96:10 - read lots of different articles and
96:12 - books and things but one of the websites
96:13 - that I've been using recently is
96:15 - brilliant org
96:16 - thanks to their sponsorship of the
96:18 - coding train and brilliant org is a
96:20 - lifelong learning website where you can
96:22 - find daily challenges you can find full
96:24 - courses which are pretty cool I've done
96:27 - some segments where I looked at some of
96:29 - these courses I want to do a deeper dive
96:30 - into maybe the artificial neural
96:32 - networks course which has a lot of
96:34 - content aligned with things that I'm
96:36 - doing here on this channel but you can
96:39 - get started for free just by going to
96:41 - brilliant org slash coding train you can
96:44 - also unlock all the features of
96:46 - brilliant
96:47 - org all of the different courses and
96:49 - things through a premium subscription
96:50 - and the first 200 people to sign up get
96:55 - a 20 percent discount
96:56 - again that's bleeped org slash coding
96:58 - train no though maybe this also works
97:00 - I'm sure they can fix that
97:02 - but it's without the vine I will fix
97:04 - that the next time I put this banner up
97:06 - so let's go do what I actually looked
97:09 - earlier this morning I didn't quickly
97:11 - and I noticed this arithmetic with waves
97:13 - and I thought this could be a fun
97:14 - challenge for us to do together here and
97:19 - me I am so me as is giving me a message
97:21 - in the chat about this were like load
97:23 - pixels behavior I'm gonna come back and
97:24 - look at that in a second so um this
97:27 - arithmetic with waves is it looks like a
97:29 - fun one to try so let's look at this so
97:32 - here's the question so first of all I
97:34 - have if you want to know more about wave
97:38 - patterns and oscillation with code
97:41 - you could go to my nature of code book
97:44 - if I go here under oscillation and
97:46 - search for wave you can see that I
97:50 - already have some code examples that
97:52 - create patterns like this so this
97:54 - probably looks very similar to what
97:56 - you're seeing right here undulating sine
97:58 - wave and one of the things I also
98:01 - demonstrate in the book and I could come
98:04 - back and I think I've done videos on
98:06 - this is what happens when you add waves
98:08 - together and if I keep going down there
98:11 - we go
98:11 - so more complex waves can be produced by
98:15 - the values of multiple waves together so
98:17 - this is just summing different waveforms
98:20 - to get this pattern that has a more
98:24 - chaotic or random feel to it it's not at
98:26 - all it's a periodic repeating pattern
98:28 - but by summing the different ways you
98:30 - can get something that as a this kind of
98:33 - quality to it so if we look here let's
98:37 - see if we can if we can figure this out
98:41 - so this is the pattern which pair of
98:45 - wave functions can be added to get the
98:46 - graph above and B a and C or B and C I
98:52 - would suspect not a and B right this
98:58 - definitely looks to me like there e are
99:01 - two like the actually the these a and B
99:06 - have the same period right period our
99:09 - frequency is the number of time period
99:11 - being the amount of time for one full
99:13 - cycle frequency being the amount of
99:17 - cycles per unit of time
99:19 - amplitude it looks like they all have
99:20 - the same amplitude being the height of
99:22 - the wave so oh and Simon's telling me
99:27 - there's a second course on neural
99:29 - networks coming soon on brilliant Simon
99:31 - who I know it's been should really be
99:35 - here talking about brilliant cuz I know
99:36 - the Simon makes a lot of excellent use
99:38 - of the brilliant website alright so
99:41 - looking at these two I wonder if I could
99:43 - quickly modify my nature of code example
99:46 - try that I just wanted to see if we can
99:47 - get it intuitive sense you know what I
99:49 - have an idea
99:52 - I have an idea here which is that this
99:55 - does cross zero so if I'm adding waves
99:58 - together and and the waves added
100:00 - together get a zero the sum is a zero I
100:03 - either have to have that part of the
100:05 - wave be above and below the line at the
100:08 - same height right I have to add a plus
100:10 - two and a negative 2 to get well not
100:12 - with a sine 0.5 and a negative 0.5 or
100:14 - both waves have to be zero so if this is
100:18 - kind of where the zero is like anywhere
100:20 - if I pick here and I go down so this a
100:23 - is not zero there Oh be a zero there Oh
100:27 - see okay it's got to be B and C I think
100:29 - that's like wick way of doing it
100:30 - it's got to be B and C so let me just
100:35 - give it a minute if anybody easy just
100:37 - look at the center point that's another
100:39 - good way of doing it the center point is
100:41 - kind of like halfway to the amplitude
100:44 - that the bottom limit so a is 0 B is at
100:50 - the bottom and C is there so it could be
100:53 - it could be a and B that tells us it
100:56 - could be a and B or B and C that doesn't
100:59 - give us the answer but I believe it has
101:01 - to be B and C let's just see if I'm
101:02 - right any other suggestions from the
101:04 - chat everybody's saying B and C
101:10 - everybody in the chat this is like a
101:11 - phone a friend this is a nice by the way
101:14 - here's another way you can do your
101:15 - challenges on brilliant down org just
101:17 - live stream and have people watching it
101:20 - let me click B and C let me hit submit
101:23 - and correct I got a one day streak
101:27 - really do these every day not just a day
101:29 - that I'm live streaming somebody tweeted
101:31 - me tomorrow or write a youtube comment
101:34 - or something I'm Way behind on reviewing
101:36 - YouTube comments one of the things
101:37 - actually that YouTube has now is you can
101:39 - filter the comments by members so I can
101:41 - see any members that commented so that I
101:43 - look at it that way but also by
101:45 - subscribers so I can see who's
101:46 - subscribed so if you want me to look at
101:48 - you I don't want to be pitching for me
101:52 - to subscribe if you like the content and
101:54 - want to get notifications or don't
101:55 - subscribe it's totally fine I will I
101:57 - actually look at all the comments of the
101:59 - best that I can never mind
102:00 - scratch all that alright let's see let
102:03 - me see if I can get a nice simulation of
102:05 - this
102:05 - I think if I go to editor p5 just saw
102:09 - toward nature of code sketches am I
102:16 - gonna be able let's look for a wave wave
102:19 - ABC additive wave so this is additive
102:24 - way this so this is the example let's
102:27 - say what I don't let's let's like cancel
102:29 - the cancel the increment incrementation
102:37 - of the wave there we go but it's doing
102:40 - it randomly so but anyway you get the
102:43 - idea
102:47 - oh how can I make a slack why should I
102:50 - be using discord instead of slack what
102:54 - let's discuss this at some point
102:56 - it's 11:30 I'm not gonna get to body
102:59 - picks today it doesn't seem and if I
103:01 - could do that really quickly with all
103:03 - that I'm sure gonna stuff I did with you
103:08 - net might allow me to just quickly in
103:09 - like 15 minutes make a body picks
103:11 - tutorial s repudiation rights I'm I'll
103:20 - be applying to NYU this application
103:21 - season I was going to study straight
103:23 - math but your course of inspire me to
103:24 - branch out find practical ways to
103:25 - express my mathematics that's lovely
103:35 - yeah so I encourage somebody wants to
103:39 - try to make a version of this I Kurt so
103:43 - this way I'm gonna take a short break
103:44 - I'm gonna try to do it look at body pics
103:45 - at least really quickly I'm gonna take a
103:46 - short break I'm gonna encourage you all
103:48 - to go sign up if you haven't already at
103:50 - brilliant org slash coding train no the
103:53 - and and while you do that um see if you
103:59 - can get my additive wave code or see if
104:03 - you can write a quick p5 sketch to to to
104:10 - create these waves and add them together
104:12 - and see if you can like prove this
104:13 - result oh let's see
104:15 - staff right okay so this looks like is
104:18 - where the graphs have 0
104:22 - oh yes actually you could look at the
104:25 - center because yeah oh and look at it
104:29 - here yeah so this looks like it's the
104:31 - same solution that I did and then oh
104:33 - this is nice this is what I wanted to
104:34 - create in p5.js oh you could create that
104:38 - yeah so this is Alka what you're saying
104:41 - to me is like music to my ears Bing Bing
104:42 - Bing Bing if YouTube membership and
104:45 - discord integrate I should really move
104:47 - from slack I think but let's go back to
104:50 - that and it's just there's lots of
104:53 - excellence Jeff so you you you write a
104:56 - comment here with you you got got five
104:58 - minutes to do this I'm gonna go to the
105:01 - wallpaper actually I'm just gonna
105:04 - actually no I'm gonna leave this here
105:05 - I'm going to leave this here I'm going
105:14 - to remove myself how do I do this me I'm
105:17 - no longer there I'm gonna mute my
105:18 - microphone I'm gonna play you some music
105:21 - this song is about five minutes long
105:23 - I'll be back in five minutes if you can
105:27 - create a p5 sketch that that solves this
105:35 - our processing sketch share it in the
105:37 - YouTube chat or share it on brilliant
105:38 - and I will I will take a look at it

111:27 - extra two or three minutes then I think
111:31 - I can try to do the body pics thing it's
111:33 - still gonna be longer than five minutes
111:34 - but I'll be back in just a few minutes
111:36 - okay this this dog this dog this start

114:38 - [Music]
114:53 - [Music]
114:56 - say once again
115:05 - [Music]
115:21 - [Music]
115:27 - and auto-tune and the internet will fix
115:29 - that
115:41 - [Music]
115:44 - all right I am back I don't have a lot
115:48 - of time a little overtime but I saw that
115:52 - there were some nice comments about this
115:57 - particular brilliant daily challenge
115:59 - where I believe this is I have to scroll
116:04 - back during the chat but someone I'm
116:07 - gonna try to get the right credit here
116:09 - there's so many chat messages oh my
116:12 - goodness
116:13 - too many chat messages I can't find it
116:15 - someone will help me with this
116:16 - but this figured out that this looks
116:19 - like sine of 2x and this is a negative
116:23 - cosine of X so if you by knowing what
116:27 - the actual functions are that are
116:30 - drawing these graphs you could then
116:32 - visualize those add those two things
116:33 - together actually we could make this
116:35 - happen super fast I know I said I was
116:37 - gonna do body pics but I just got a let
116:40 - me let me know come back come come back
116:42 - to me here okay yes leave this page
116:43 - leave this page wave I just want to look
116:47 - at the simple wave exercise graph wave
116:50 - and wave this one right this is okay
116:53 - okay stop stop stop
116:55 - so let's let me I think this is
116:57 - something I can adjust so let's look at
117:00 - this start angle forget about the start
117:04 - angle angle is just always going to be
117:06 - zero and I want to draw map sine of the
117:17 - angle angle velocity oh I've done some
117:20 - ridiculous thing I'm going to simplify
117:22 - this angle is just going to be angle
117:30 - equals map X which goes between zero and
117:33 - width to between zero and 2pi times four
117:41 - so I want to get four cycles through the
117:43 - wave um and that's I'm gonna need
117:47 - something wider can I get some more
117:49 - space here let's make this let's give me
117:54 - let's give me some more space here why
117:59 - is this actually oh I can I know I'm
118:01 - standing in front of the code let me
118:03 - just remove myself for a second that's
118:08 - good let's make it much less high let's
118:15 - say and let's actually have this go
118:18 - between 50 and 150 there we go that
118:26 - looks more like what we're looking for
118:28 - and let's say begin shape and I can now
118:37 - I can bring myself back into this
118:39 - picture begin shape and shape stroke 255
118:46 - no fill we can say sign of what am I
118:53 - looking to do right vertex get rid of
119:03 - this stroke there we go all right so
119:07 - there and let's give ourselves a lot
119:09 - more points to work with there we go so
119:12 - this is sine of X basically sine of X so
119:16 - if I were to do this
119:18 - here's sine of X when we said cosine of
119:22 - X then sine of two times angle so these
119:27 - are both of the graph those are both and
119:30 - then let's do one that's those two
119:32 - things added together and cosine and
119:40 - again this is like a sort of awful way
119:42 - that I'm doing this but I think it's
119:44 - going to demonstrate the idea let's run
119:50 - this and let's comment out the first two
119:56 - see does that look like the picture that
120:00 - is in the brilliant challenge it does it
120:07 - kind of looks like it's in Reverse right
120:08 - no I'm just yeah I wonder if oh because
120:13 - it's because the y-axis is flipped in a
120:17 - computer graphics system so I should
120:19 - really make all of these I should really
120:20 - just make this one two negative one to
120:24 - invert that and there we go so we have
120:28 - solved this particular brilliant
120:31 - challenge I am going to save this I like
120:36 - to go here I don't know if anybody
120:37 - posted an answer let's let's right here
120:43 - is p5.js code to demonstrate demonstrate
120:50 - adding two waves together let's put in a
120:54 - link source code let's do this let's do
121:09 - a quick
121:17 - take a screenshot of this and added it
121:21 - this is fun okay here we go come on drag
121:34 - and drop people oh oh yeah that's what
121:35 - I'm doing
121:49 - oops there we go alright so if you've
121:55 - made something please you comment here
121:58 - or all that stuff and thank you so much
122:01 - again to brilliant artwork for the
122:03 - sponsorship of the coding trade now very
122:06 - little time left
122:08 - but with the little time I have left I
122:14 - am going to go to reference body pics oh
122:30 - my goodness oh look at this there's a
122:34 - lot more to body pics you know I'm gonna
122:36 - come back and do a video on body pics
122:39 - next time let's just test out the idea
122:41 - I'm just gonna do this with you in the
122:43 - live context and not worry about the
122:45 - sort of like published tutorial because
122:46 - I do want to spend some more time
122:48 - talking about body pics and I think if I
122:52 - look up we're gonna see this is an
122:55 - excellent poster reference by dan-o vet
123:01 - who is a graduate student researcher at
123:03 - ITP and there are other other people
123:06 - credited here who have helped with this
123:08 - particular post but this is a post that
123:13 - describes the body pics model which does
123:15 - something quite similar to what the unit
123:18 - face model does but gives you a map of
123:21 - the body with colors assigned to
123:24 - different parts of the body so let's
123:27 - just see if I could get this to work if
123:29 - i duplicate my unit and all kind of like
123:34 - this is gonna just be practice maybe I
123:36 - will later this week pick back up with
123:38 - this I definitely I have to you know I
123:41 - said 11:30 because I knew I had to leave
123:43 - by 12:00 so let's see what I get here
123:47 - [Music]
123:48 - let's see here if I can let's load up
123:55 - this so this is a unit I'm just curious
123:58 - what happens if I literally all-out I do
124:02 - is just change this to ml5 body pics I
124:07 - think I there's a bug where body pics
124:09 - doesn't work with preload but let's
124:12 - confirm that so body pics model ready so
124:18 - in theory I should be able to just do
124:19 - body pics here and everything should be
124:22 - the same right it's the same exact
124:28 - algorithm for segmenting images I'm
124:33 - going to take out this pixel processing
124:35 - thing and otherwise everything should be
124:39 - the same that's body pics body pics
124:42 - let's just see body pics that segment is
124:49 - not a function
124:56 - ml5 body pixel I think it doesn't work
124:59 - with preload let's comment it out this
125:03 - really shouldn't be up here I mean the
125:05 - order doesn't actually matter for how it
125:06 - works but this is very confusing to me
125:10 - so let's say body pics equals ml v body
125:17 - pics and then I'm going to have model
125:21 - ready and function model when the model
125:28 - has loaded let's try calling segment
125:34 - here
125:43 - and let's say the model is ready let's
125:48 - see what happens here if you want to
125:55 - classify a video past the video element
125:57 - into the constructor
126:07 - let's try sequencing this when the video
126:10 - is ready let's load the model and then
126:14 - when the model is ready let's call
126:16 - segment let's look at them I'm glad I'm
126:25 - looking at this now so I see it wants me
126:29 - this is very this is revealing a problem
126:31 - which is that we're inconsistent it
126:34 - seems this wants me to look to actually
126:37 - include the video to sort of assign body
126:41 - pics to that video which probably has
126:43 - some advantages but shouldn't be
126:46 - required but that's probably it's
126:49 - probably only going to work that way
126:55 - then I would do this without passing it
127:01 - the video specifically whoops
127:10 - okay image was expecting p5 image what
127:16 - failed let's look at the results it's
127:25 - not even draw anything so this isn't
127:29 - round we're two sort of debugging this
127:30 - is good for me okay ah so this is
127:34 - getting more stuff I'm getting masked
127:36 - background mask person oh there is so
127:39 - the properties that come back actually
127:40 - have different names which is fine mask
127:43 - background mask person so this actually
127:45 - makes more sense you know in some ways
127:48 - in that there are these masks that are
127:50 - coming back so let's take a look at what
127:51 - these look like what was one mask
127:58 - background mask background let's try
128:03 - that
128:08 - interesting so you can see it's giving
128:10 - me a solid color background remember
128:14 - blue is what I'm drawing behind so
128:16 - there's an alpha mask where it detects
128:18 - me as the person and it's it's all it's
128:23 - giving it all as one color so if I
128:26 - change masks this to mask person I miss
128:31 - I missus I was expecting different
128:35 - colors did I not hit save hmm so how
128:45 - does this particular example how do I
128:51 - get this is what I want do I have to
128:56 - give it the palette like if I don't give
129:01 - it the palette so I'm gonna investigate
129:07 - this further I'm hoping to come back
129:08 - Thursday morning this week Friday
129:10 - unfortunately does it seem like it's a
129:11 - good day for me this semester but I'll
129:13 - come back Thursday or Friday to continue
129:15 - this but let me let's just try to get a
129:18 - little bit further just to see and maybe
129:20 - those of you watching can investigate
129:21 - this and file some issues on ml5 so that
129:25 - we can kind of work on this so where do
129:30 - I create them all we've do this so I'm
129:32 - just gonna copy all of these options
129:34 - over when I say let options equal and
129:42 - then I'm gonna put in the options here
129:46 - let's see what happens
129:56 - ask background that's mask person is it
130:00 - only in the raw data is that where the I
130:05 - have to like get all the colors from the
130:07 - raw edge something is definitely I'm
130:09 - either missing something or mask
130:11 - background let's try that again
130:16 - these also seem like the same thing
130:18 - right there's no difference here
130:19 - oh no that's inverted huh
130:23 - let's look at ml5 examples and see if oh
130:32 - sorry ml five medical examination is not
130:35 - what I want
130:37 - let's go here p5.js body pics do we see
130:49 - it body pics image what Oh body pics
130:54 - parts that's what I was missing
131:04 - yeah look something is different in them
131:08 - version this is the this is the develop
131:11 - this is the release branch yeah that's
131:13 - the release branch
131:24 - Oh what am I doing wrong the stuff just
131:30 - worked like I'm like writing the
131:31 - examples in a outputs tried segmentation
131:34 - threshold body pics video create HSB
131:39 - palette okay that's a function video
131:45 - segmentation image so there's a segment
131:50 - with parts function so that's my problem
131:58 - and then this is like making a palette
132:01 - but I don't that I can just use the
132:03 - default palette or set the colors so let
132:07 - me go back oh my god we go back to my
132:11 - example I didn't realize it was a
132:15 - separate I'm you know read the read the
132:19 - manual I think is probably a video model
132:24 - segment segment with parts yes yes
132:29 - segments with parts I'm tired it's been
132:32 - two hours let me run this now and now
132:37 - you see this this is this was my version
132:39 - of it and now there's actually an image
132:43 - so this is image is what comes through
132:46 - here Wow mask back we got a we
132:48 - definitely I definitely want to make the
132:51 - AP is with you net and body pics more
132:53 - consistent so I don't want to open again
132:55 - of issue to discuss the naming and sort
132:58 - of style inconsistencies between these
133:00 - two models that would be super helpful
133:02 - and now I can say result image because I
133:08 - from you net I think you want the mask
133:10 - right and and what just happened here
133:16 - cannot read with a property undefined so
133:22 - okay let me get rid of these options for
133:24 - a second just use the defaults
133:31 - so I create the video when the video is
133:34 - ready I create the body pics model I
133:38 - load the body pics model tie it to the
133:42 - video and the model is ready I call
133:44 - segment with parts should then I get the
133:49 - results I set that to a variable call it
133:53 - again and then draw that segmented image
133:56 - and it would be actually interesting to
133:58 - draw it on top of the video just sort of
134:02 - curious what happens there and let's see
134:04 - what happens there we go and now if what
134:11 - if I wanted to what I could do is I
134:14 - could also get the mask could do some
134:16 - kind of masking but maybe if I just
134:18 - actually give it a little alpha right
134:20 - now I can sort of see ooh I need to say
134:29 - no tint here this is what I'm going for
134:35 - I can kind of see and I want to make it
134:42 - much more clear there so now we can sort
134:50 - of see what body picks is doing and in
134:52 - theory if I could get myself further
134:54 - from the camera you could see maybe more
134:59 - body parts great all right so hopefully
135:04 - this was helpful to you this is me sort
135:05 - of like figuring this out I'm gonna come
135:10 - back on Thursday and maybe do any
135:14 - addendums to the content the video
135:17 - tutorial that I hope to have edited
135:19 - together about the unit model as well as
135:22 - cover this body pics model a bit more so
135:25 - thank you everybody for watching
135:30 - I hope you enjoyed this livestream I
135:35 - sort of hit a wall like about five
135:37 - minutes ago I feel like maybe looks like
135:40 - a blood sugar thing going on I need to
135:42 - go eat some
135:44 - so like I think I got something in my
135:45 - eye but I'm gonna go I'm gonna take a
135:48 - break I've got a lot to to do for the
135:52 - rest of the day and tomorrow and I will
135:55 - hopefully be back in McKenney a hundred
135:58 - percent promises but I'm hoping to be
136:00 - back either Thursday or Friday this week
136:02 - if not next week and be on the lookout I
136:06 - know I keep teasing this maybe nobody's
136:08 - gonna like it I have no idea but I
136:11 - recorded a video from a different
136:13 - location not in this room and we I'm not
136:20 - gonna say anything more about it
136:21 - I look forward to seeing you next time
136:24 - on the coding train let's see if I can
136:25 - answer a couple questions
136:30 - why not make a logarithmic frequency
136:33 - analyzer on p5.js asks Andre yes great
136:38 - question that I would encourage you to
136:40 - do so that would probably that might be
136:43 - a more accurate and effective way of
136:45 - actually making a tuner I was just kind
136:47 - of curious to go through the different
136:48 - pre train models that are in ml5 library
136:59 - the live stream it's always at this time
137:01 - asks Felipe I wish so there was a brief
137:06 - moment in time last year where I had a
137:09 - consistent every Wednesday at 10:00 a.m.
137:11 - live stream 10:00 a.m. Eastern I'm in
137:12 - the Eastern time zone I'm in New York
137:14 - City I'm in Brooklyn actually Brooklyn
137:16 - New York but I haven't figured that out
137:19 - yet for this year so soon I hope to
137:22 - establish that but at the moment your
137:25 - best way to find out when the next live
137:27 - stream is or fortunately subscribe to
137:31 - the channel and and click the
137:33 - notification bell thing because when I
137:36 - schedule it you'll get a notification
137:39 - but I do expect I can tell you this week
137:43 - that if there is another live stream
137:46 - this week the only two times I'm
137:48 - available to do so right now are
137:49 - Thursday morning around 9:00 10:00 a.m.
137:51 - Eastern or Friday morning around 9:00 or
137:53 - 10:00 a.m. Eastern so one might be
137:56 - scheduled for those two times I would
137:57 - probably like add it the night before or
137:59 - the morning of what's the fastest
138:06 - JavaScript engine on the Mac no idea
138:09 - there's somebody else left answer make a
138:12 - tutorial how to make a bar graph
138:13 - spectrum with logarithmic frequency
138:15 - scaling p5 sound I'm pretty sure I have
138:17 - that p5 sound FFT I'm this video right
138:26 - here on the coding train
138:28 - 17:11 I'm pretty sure somewhere in this
138:33 - video I do something like that here yeah
138:38 - there you go so I think if you check out
138:40 - this video where I am very red or am I
138:42 - just very pale here I'm not sure you'll
138:45 - find that
138:47 - [Music]
138:49 - rendering 3d ray marching yeah I have I
138:53 - have a lot of coding challenges that I
138:55 - want to have a long list
138:57 - marching squares is kind of on the top
139:01 - of that list ah oh this is so important
139:10 - that you're asking so remember I spun
139:12 - the wheel I'm not spinning the wheel
139:14 - that still got to work out this wheel
139:15 - system nekima asked will you do the coal
139:18 - Lots conjecture coding challenge like
139:19 - the wheel said last Friday here's the
139:21 - thing I already did it this other video
139:26 - series so it's gonna come out soon the
139:29 - first one this week is not the Collatz
139:30 - conjecture I don't want to spoil too
139:32 - much but I did it it will be coming out
139:34 - if I had to guess right now that's one's
139:38 - probably gonna be next week so I'm
139:40 - hoping to have a coding challenge once a
139:41 - week or once every two weeks with a
139:43 - slightly different format we've ever
139:45 - have Joshua Davis as a guest great idea
139:47 - for a guest right now I'm not up and
139:49 - running to have guests when I can get
139:51 - back up and running to have guests
139:52 - Joshua Davis would be a great guest
139:54 - heartbeats and sound get octave bands
139:59 - and log averages yeah those are all
140:01 - great ideas limited time in the world oh
140:06 - wait alka made a brilliant thing
140:09 - let's go code dot code code pen dot io /
140:16 - alka am I gonna find it here like recent
140:22 - showcase all right I'll just gonna
140:25 - lazily type in pen /qb be easy RW
140:32 - everyone should check out coding trained
140:34 - viewer alkis
140:36 - code pen there's lots of great examples
140:38 - there qbb capital e there we go oh this
140:44 - is much nicer
140:50 - much better thank you thank you for
140:53 - doing that
140:53 - oh I I'm no longer in my goodbye rainbow
140:59 - song we'll just speed over to the end
141:03 - here so thank you everybody I will leave
141:06 - the wallpaper slide up for a few minutes
141:08 - so the chat can keep going but I'm going
141:11 - to say goodbye now I'm gonna thank you
141:14 - especially to thank you to everyone who
141:16 - supports me or even just watches or like
141:18 - to the person who said hello to me on
141:20 - 4th Avenue in Brooklyn yesterday I doubt
141:23 - you're watching but somebody came up to
141:25 - me and say hey coding trained and I said
141:28 - that's me and that was like a wonderful
141:30 - part of my day so Christopher Jessup for
141:33 - your super chats all the other super
141:34 - chats the members the viewers the people
141:37 - the people who help operate the New York
141:40 - City Transit System that got me here
141:42 - this morning I want to thank everyone
141:43 - goodbye
