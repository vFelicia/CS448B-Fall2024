00:00 - hopefully this is working I had a little
00:02 - lunch break and I have returned to do a
00:04 - coding Challenge and I'm waiting to sort
00:07 - of see out of the corner of my eye if
00:10 - the YouTube stream starts to pop up I
00:12 - see it popping up which makes it appear
00:13 - to me that this is working so I am uh G
00:17 - to take a minute to get set up here
00:19 - perhaps introduce myself although I did
00:20 - that this morning um I'll let people
00:23 - sort of trickle on in uh if you are
00:25 - watching this video as an archive on
00:27 - YouTube I would encourage you to check
00:29 - the description there will be links to
00:30 - various time codes of things happening
00:32 - in this video as opposed to this
00:34 - rambling introduction and there also
00:36 - hopefully out of this video uh will be
00:38 - an edited version of it that will also
00:40 - appear a little bit later U my name is
00:42 - Dan schiffman I am here in the afternoon
00:44 - I did some tutorials this morning on git
00:46 - and GitHub and now I am back to do a
00:50 - coding challenge uh and I'm seeing that
00:53 - people are here I'm going to not run
00:55 - updates on my computer I'm going to just
00:57 - check and see if twitch appears to be
00:59 - working and looks like it is and U so
01:02 - let me just Dive Right In okay not a lot
01:05 - of exposition I def I have a a little
01:07 - less than an hour so we'll sort of see
01:09 - so I was poking through my somebody had
01:11 - mentioned a couple things were have been
01:13 - requested for a coding challenge um one
01:16 - this idea of procedural
01:18 - textures okay so that's topic number one
01:21 - topic number two uh procedural
01:24 - terrain and both of these ideas can be
01:28 - implemented in the same way one being
01:30 - rendered as a two-dimensional image that
01:32 - gets textured on something another as an
01:34 - actual uh two-dimensional plane in a 3D
01:37 - World with perhaps some depth to it so
01:39 - um I was digging around and I found this
01:42 - uh example this is actually not the
01:44 - example this is I had an example from
01:47 - the nature of code book uh associated
01:50 - with pearlin noise and in a few minutes
01:53 - I kind of quickly adapted the example to
01:55 - do a few different things and created
01:57 - this so what I would like to do is re
01:59 - program this from
02:02 - scratch um and I don't I'm not 100% sure
02:04 - I want to do it entirely from scratch I
02:06 - might make a video tutorial where I
02:08 - start with a little bit of a foundation
02:10 - I'm also thinking about if it makes
02:12 - sense um just checking the chat and
02:14 - sound I'm also thinking about if it
02:16 - makes sense to do two versions two
02:19 - videos one would be basically doing the
02:22 - piece that you need from this which is a
02:25 - two-dimensional pearlin noise on its own
02:28 - and then taking that code and bringing
02:30 - it into 3D to create this kind of
02:32 - terrain at the same time I kind of want
02:34 - this all to be one video now I was
02:37 - looking at my code for this and I want
02:38 - to like explore something before I make
02:40 - the video I was noticing that the way
02:42 - that I render this terrain is with quads
02:46 - so in other words it is each um it is
02:51 - just a whole lot of rectangles not
02:53 - rectangles quads placed next to each
02:55 - other and the vertices are if you
02:57 - imagine them all flat the vertices are
03:00 - all moving up and down uh to create this
03:03 - kind of bumpy texture so um what I
03:06 - wanted to look at is I think that I
03:07 - might be able to make the code a bit
03:09 - more efficient if I used a quad strip
03:13 - and when I make it from scratch so what
03:15 - I want to and maybe some of you who are
03:17 - watching might have some tips for me so
03:19 - I just want to look at the processing
03:20 - reference really
03:22 - quickly
03:24 - uh and I'm going to go to reference and
03:27 - I'm going to go to begin shape
03:30 - and I'm going to look here and I'm going
03:32 - to look at a quad
03:35 - strip so because quads what I need to do
03:39 - with a quad is set all four
03:42 - vertices and with a quad strip is it
03:45 - setting it across 30 comma
03:48 - 20 that's X is 30 Y is 20 then X is 30
03:54 - 75 Wait no that's down at the
03:57 - bottom then 50 comma 20 then 5075 so
04:01 - it's doing it like this let's see if I
04:03 - can modify my example to use quad strip
04:07 - ah al so great question uh Christopher
04:10 - akiki asks what does procedural refer to
04:14 - exactly so what I mean by that is the
04:17 - the terrain the texture or the terrain
04:20 - where um how is generated through an
04:23 - algorithm as opposed to you could hand
04:26 - draw or hand
04:27 - design I generally so you
04:30 - could you could hand design a Terrain
04:32 - saying like oh it's going to be like
04:35 - this you know you could sort of sculpt
04:37 - it or manually set all the points or use
04:40 - an image some sort of image to like
04:42 - generate what the terrain should be but
04:44 - this is through an algorithm that
04:45 - algorithm being curling noise um I
04:48 - generally use triangles for this kind of
04:50 - that makes total sense to use
04:53 - triangles so in that case triangle
04:57 - fan or triangle STP I think is what I
05:00 - want because I want to go
05:04 - across so um let me try it with triangle
05:07 - strip so let me see here so I want to
05:10 - simplify this for a
05:13 - second so I'm going to work this out and
05:15 - then I'm G to I'm doing this sort of
05:19 - backwards so I run this you can see what
05:21 - this is this is just static version of
05:24 - what I'm making and I can actually even
05:27 - take the rotation out
05:31 - um and you can see it looks like this
05:35 - with no rotation and in
05:37 - fact let me uh also just to be
05:45 - really specific about
05:54 - this uh
06:00 - um boy what have I done here uh let me
06:02 - take this out okay so what I'm doing is
06:06 - making this and let me uh um sorry I'm
06:09 - just trying to simplify this to
06:10 - understand how triangle strip
06:12 - works um let's run this one more time so
06:16 - you can see this is a I'm basically want
06:18 - to turn this thing and this is what I'm
06:21 - starting with and I'm turning this on
06:23 - its side and then I'm raising various
06:25 - points to make it a bumpy thing and this
06:29 - would work but it was suggested to me in
06:31 - the chat to use triangles which I think
06:32 - makes sense and um oh I have uh I have
06:37 - not start um the coding challenge by the
06:41 - way is going to be terrain generation
06:43 - and I'm sort of I haven't started doing
06:44 - it yet I'm figuring something out before
06:46 - I start doing it so you know um so what
06:50 - I want to turn this into now is I just
06:52 - don't I don't know how the triangle
06:53 - strip stuff works so uh I'm kind of
06:56 - hacking through an example I made before
06:58 - and I'm going to say uh triangle strip
07:02 - so if I just did this by the way what am
07:04 - I going to get kind of a crazy mess of
07:06 - stuff so that's not correct and what I'm
07:08 - going to do also is
07:14 - um just do like a one by
07:20 - one so this this is what I okay so hold
07:24 - on okay I'm figuring this out so what I
07:27 - think that I want to do is do
07:30 - and I'm going to take out the Z is what
07:32 - I meant to
07:34 - do so what if I just do
07:39 - um the top row than the next
07:44 - row uh oops and I'm going to do the top
07:47 - row in two
07:53 - y's
07:55 - uh all right hold on I'm figuring this
07:58 - out
08:02 - uh oh yeah okay z z translate does that
08:07 - work oh maybe it doesn't work oh I I
08:10 - don't want the begin shape the begin
08:12 - shape is around the whole
08:14 - thing right because the the triangle
08:17 - strip is one giant shape
08:21 - now okay there I got
08:25 - something uh
08:30 - I just want to let's try this
08:32 - again and
08:39 - uh so okay hold on a sec everybody I
08:42 - don't like I want this to be at X get
08:46 - rid of this and X plus this should be at
08:50 - Y and this should be at
08:53 - y uh do I have a scale here or
08:57 - something um
09:03 - x times scale soor I'm just figuring
09:06 - this out
09:08 - here how does the triangle strip work I
09:10 - should really just look this up instead
09:11 - of trying to do it haphazardly there we
09:14 - go okay now I'm getting something so
09:16 - that is not right uh why okay so can I
09:20 - go
09:21 - across two triangles instead of a
09:23 - rectangle so you have four points P1 P2
09:25 - P3 P4 for a square you have a triangle
09:27 - you have three I need to make multiple
09:29 - triangle strips you can't make the whole
09:31 - Trin from just one okay good thank
09:34 - you so each row is a triangle
09:37 - strip so those of you who had done this
09:43 - before let me ask this question to you
09:47 - guys in the chat who are helping me with
09:48 - this what I'm assuming I need to do so
09:51 - this is what I have points go across
09:53 - like this and points go across like this
09:57 - and then this is a triangle strip right
09:59 - should get this
10:04 - right so what order is the vertices I
10:07 - was thinking I could go like this one
10:09 - two three four five six one two three
10:12 - four five six like that or maybe I have
10:15 - to go one two three four five six seven
10:19 - eight n like something like that can I
10:21 - go boom boom boom boom boom boom boom I
10:23 - don't know what the order to do the
10:24 - vertices somebody tell me in the
10:27 - chat uh uh
10:29 - you need one a triangle strip is like a
10:31 - line yeah okay so we're going to do one
10:34 - row just one row and we're going to say
10:37 - begin shape for every
10:40 - X and if I do it
10:46 - like
10:47 - this what do I get I get everything
10:51 - going across now let me just check these
10:52 - vertices ah this should be at
10:57 - zero no no not zero this should be at y
11:01 - times scale and this should be at
11:05 - y like this I'm going I'm going across
11:09 - oh oh I'm in the wrong
11:14 - place I'm gonna be figuring this out the
11:16 - whole time up and down up and down uh
11:19 - Gregor SN says up down up down so uh
11:24 - this
11:26 - is oh plus there we go
11:31 - there we go thank you up down up down up
11:34 - down up down perfect okay I got it that
11:37 - makes sense so now if uh if I say I
11:43 - forgot what this
11:45 - was
11:47 - uh do I have uh the number of rows this
11:50 - should be is this are these in a
11:53 - variable what's the chance oh excellent
11:55 - okay so that's working up down up down
11:57 - up down
11:59 - uh and then um okay
12:02 - perfect
12:04 - uh I'm just curious if I put in this
12:12 - now this is going to be
12:15 - better whoa okay interesting I didn't
12:19 - get everything in the right place oh
12:21 - because this needs to go up by two each
12:25 - time then right because if I do top
12:26 - bottom then I got to go up by two let's
12:28 - see right
12:31 - oh but I'm in the wrong so the center
12:35 - okay this is harder than I it's funny I
12:37 - had this totally working um okay uh okay
12:42 - so so let me think about this
12:44 - again uh up down up down up down up down
12:47 - up down okay uh so I do the first row
12:51 - and then I skip and I do the next row oh
12:55 - no the next row has the bottom one
12:56 - connected to the to the next one so it
12:59 - should be no
13:02 - skipping I should go to the next one and
13:06 - I wonder if the Z is off somehow so
13:11 - right of
13:13 - course so this is okay so first of all
13:15 - I'm in the wrong place I translate width
13:18 - divided by
13:20 - height
13:22 - um get rid of this for a
13:25 - second okay
13:27 - so what did I get wrong that's not
13:30 - matching
13:32 - because
13:33 - why um so the hip bone is ah thank you
13:39 - thank you y + one the second one is the
13:43 - bottom row and this should be not to the
13:46 - very bottom thank you brilliant
13:48 - brilliant brilliant there we go we're
13:50 - back with triangle strips now uh and uh
13:55 - um let me just put this back in and
13:58 - excellent
13:59 - so why what am I width divided by two oh
14:03 - minus the um so I need to translate
14:07 - based on the size of the
14:09 - landscape uh which
14:11 - I'll deal with later um because I'm
14:15 - going to program this from scratch
14:17 - anyway I mean I'm want to fix let me fix
14:19 - this one to get this working and then
14:20 - I'm going to build it up for doing it
14:22 - from scratch but um because I'm not
14:25 - going to do it in an object but uh let
14:27 - me just see um minus um land W / 2 uh
14:36 - minus land H divided by two and the
14:41 - landscape oh it does have a w and an H
14:43 - already that's
14:44 - brilliant uh divided by two okay so
14:47 - let's see here this should do it yeah
14:50 - okay so now it's in the
14:51 - middle and uh if I go back to adding
14:55 - this rotation in we should see it looks
14:58 - like a
14:59 - landscape like
15:03 - that um
15:05 - and I probably want it to be a little
15:07 - further down like something like
15:11 - this you
15:13 - know and
15:15 - then there we go and then
15:20 - uh make it much
15:24 - bigger a the triangle strip is much
15:27 - slower it worked with my quads I guess I
15:30 - better do the
15:32 - quads can it really not render
15:40 - that or did it just go off
15:47 - screen doesn't see make it
15:52 - wider what did I I must have typed
15:54 - something weird in
16:00 - what happens
16:01 - when oh is the Y uh so anyway I'm going
16:07 - to start this is this is a part I can
16:08 - figure out
16:10 - later I don't I i' like because I'm off
16:12 - but I'll I'll figure I'll do it
16:13 - correctly when I build it up again from
16:15 - scratch I just wanted to know how the
16:16 - triangle strip worked okay
16:20 - um upper lower vertices be from the okay
16:23 - so here we go I'm going to um I'm going
16:25 - to uh I guess I should fix no you know
16:27 - what I should make this one work cuz
16:28 - it's a visual reference so okay let me
16:31 - figure this out um where are these going
16:34 - these are going from x * scale y * scale
16:38 - plus scale uh x x is columns rows
16:44 - columns w h z is new floats Z gets
16:47 - calculated uh through this
16:50 - mechanism that makes
16:53 - sense uh okay and then what am I losing
16:58 - when I start making it super
17:01 - wide uh this should be the center minus
17:06 - its width and
17:10 - height and then zoom
17:12 - out right
17:14 - like oh whoops I don't want
17:19 - this to
17:21 - start okay that makes
17:24 - sense uh
17:30 - I want to get this totally working and
17:32 - then I'm going to then I'm going to
17:33 - explain it and build it up from scratch
17:36 - so uh what happened when I made Y super
17:40 - big did it just okay so that's
17:43 - fine and then it's the rotation that's
17:46 - the
17:47 - issue so let's make an
17:50 - angle uh that is a map to Mouse
17:55 - X Mouse X goes from zero to
18:01 - Wi to 0 to 2 pi uh so let's see what
18:07 - happens
18:09 - here and then let's rotate X by that
18:12 - angle why did it go out of
18:16 - view uh so that it's oh it has to do
18:19 - with like my point of view here so let
18:21 - me Zoom
18:23 - way further out
18:29 - so you can see it is oh of course of
18:33 - course of course it's rotating around
18:35 - the I want to rotate around the um
18:39 - Center so I really want to okay I got
18:43 - it how annoying okay so I want to leave
18:47 - this
18:48 - here so this needs to stay here and it's
18:52 - right but I need to draw everything this
18:54 - is what I wanted because I want to see
18:55 - it looking like this but I just need to
18:57 - move it over and shift it down a little
18:59 - bit which shouldn't be too hard like
19:01 - this I should be able to just shift the
19:02 - whole thing down like
19:06 - this right that's what it's going to
19:08 - look like and now in here uh the
19:11 - location of the vertices is really minus
19:15 - W / two minus W / two minus minus h /
19:21 - two minus H divided two so this should
19:24 - then reenter it back there we go that's
19:27 - what I wanted it to look like
19:30 - uh so now I can go back and just
19:32 - hardcode in that
19:33 - angle uh hard code in that angle and
19:37 - there we go and now I can add back in
19:41 - the thing where I uh adjust the the the
19:45 - terrain so that it looks like I'm flying
19:46 - over it there we go oh triangle strip is
19:49 - faster okay so this is ultimately what I
19:52 - want it to look like let's um let me
19:55 - make it a little bit further back
19:59 - oh it's at four it's yeah and a little
20:01 - bit wider what happens if I do this just
20:04 - curious to see what sort of speed I'm
20:05 - going to get from this thing there we go
20:07 - so that's pretty good okay now I'm ready
20:10 - hopefully to build this thing and
20:12 - explain it uh this is what I want to
20:15 - make to make it look like you're flying
20:17 - over this infinite terrain
20:21 - scene okay everybody I got 32 people
20:24 - watching I'm going to check twitch uh
20:26 - there are two people watching on Twitch
20:28 - and 2 people watching on YouTube I need
20:30 - to get some water I just realized um so
20:33 - enjoy this uh terrain for a minute I'm
20:35 - going to go get some water you're going
20:37 - to go with me to get water even though
20:38 - you can't see me I'm talking to myself
20:40 - as I walk to get some water so I'm going
20:42 - to have to explain a few different
20:44 - concepts um in this particular video um
20:48 - one of which is pearing
20:50 - noise um but I do have a pein noise
20:53 - Standalone video which I can link to so
20:57 - I've got to explain pear in noise I got
20:59 - to explain a little bit about 3D and
21:01 - triangle
21:02 - strips um I have
21:05 - to uh and that's really it actually
21:08 - that's sort of like the main thing um
21:13 - and what I so and um you know I was
21:17 - going to try to do it as
21:20 - a um I think I'm going to try to do this
21:24 - in one video and then what I can do is
21:27 - if there are oops if there are certain
21:29 - aspects of the
21:31 - video that are
21:34 - confusing like more I could make a
21:37 - separate video that goes through some of
21:40 - the uh pear and
21:42 - noise um stuff in more detail so I'm
21:45 - definitely going to need to draw some
21:46 - diagrams for this because it's going to
21:48 - be anytime I do anything in 3D it's
21:50 - going to be confusing um and so I'm
21:53 - doing I'm going to do this one in
21:54 - processing but I would I'm going to try
21:56 - to make um there's been a lot of updates
21:58 - to P5 js's webgl recently so I'm going
22:01 - to see if I can uh redo it um also using
22:05 - p5js and see how that goes okay so if
22:09 - you've got any questions I'm just about
22:11 - ready to start um please ask them in the
22:13 - chat it is
22:16 - 326 I'm hoping
22:21 - um I'm hoping to be done with this by uh
22:25 - 4 because I've got to go then so we're
22:28 - going to see if in 35 this is going to
22:30 - be a 35 minute
22:32 - challenge if I can do this in 35
22:35 - minutes um I do have this example to
22:39 - refer to just in
22:40 - case um okay let me just check the chat
22:43 - uh qu um by the way my oh the nature of
22:46 - code just got activated on Caden um uh
22:49 - Andrew Kim asks are you going to be
22:51 - actively grading or in the forums so the
22:53 - grading all happens through their system
22:55 - they have an automatic way of doing it
22:57 - it's really not um
22:59 - and there's peer assessment for uh as
23:01 - well um but I am definitely going to be
23:04 - actively in the forums as much as I can
23:06 - so I will be there tweet at me if
23:08 - there's stuff that I should be taking a
23:09 - look at I want to try to be involved
23:11 - with it as much as
23:12 - possible
23:15 - um um okay uh here we go
23:19 - so I'm gonna I need a let me get a new
23:24 - sketch
23:25 - up and um oh I don't want to close that
23:29 - sorry hold on I'm just getting set up
23:31 - here I need setup I me
23:35 - draw uh three uh pein noise
23:41 - terrain and I'm going to save that on
23:43 - the desktop under coding rainbow pearlin
23:46 - noise terrain and size 600 600
23:51 - p3d uh background uh zero and let's see
23:55 - what we've got so far this is looking
23:58 - good
23:59 - this will be our start okay
24:04 - um
24:06 - yeah I think I'm ready uh oh can you
24:10 - also make the terrain Cube based like in
24:12 - Minecraft oh nothing would be
24:15 - um nothing would be more thrilling to me
24:18 - than to do some Minecraft stuff I really
24:20 - got to get to that at some point I need
24:21 - a week off to just only like work on
24:23 - figuring out um that but anyway um yes I
24:27 - would love to do a cube based one not
24:28 - today though this is this will be a
24:30 - start okay so let me get this back
24:33 - up and
24:36 - uh kind of love I love how they just
24:38 - like appear in the back like that it's
24:40 - kind of a cool effect okay so here we go
24:44 - uh drink a little
24:46 - water right oh I wanted to put I just
24:49 - want to put a timer on so I can um you
24:53 - to bear with me for a second um this is
24:56 - not so that I can
24:59 - um let me see if I can do this in a
25:02 - brief moment uh uh play the Jeopardy
25:04 - music sing to
25:05 - yourself uh sources I'm I'm adding this
25:09 - timer
25:11 - thing I probably shouldn't do this um
25:15 - because this is going to take too long
25:17 - right now if
25:19 - this okay uh that should be good and
25:23 - then if I
25:26 - um add it to
25:32 - uh
25:34 - uh okay and then if I add I'm going to
25:37 - try this really briefly and if it
25:38 - doesn't you know what this is not going
25:39 - to work oh there it
25:41 - is uh
25:45 - oops I'm going do this really really
25:48 - briefly uh stick this up here and then
25:52 - I'm going to uh I'm almost done here I
25:55 - guess got to crop it
25:59 - oops leave that
26:02 - there bottom crop it there and come back
26:07 - a little bit that should do it
26:10 - okay uh there we go okay so I have a
26:14 - little T timer now where am I how come
26:18 - I'm not here anymore I've disappeared oh
26:22 - why do I try to change this stuff what
26:25 - happened to
26:26 - me oh I messed up I messed up
26:28 - everything's going to be fine and oh I
26:30 - did I really really really screw
26:32 - up um sorry everyone I really I think I
26:35 - really screwed
26:37 - up um
26:42 - uh uh delete this I'm coming back to
26:46 - life there I am by the way this is the
26:50 - raw view now okay I don't know if you
26:51 - can see this by the way this is what hey
26:54 - look at me this is my raw view of this
26:56 - is me with the green screen I screwed up
26:58 - and I trying to add this timer I deleted
27:00 - the green screen by accident so I'm
27:01 - going to key this back
27:04 - out it'll just take a
27:07 - second um I'm gonna do this I'm going to
27:10 - go to here use Chrome key okay that's
27:12 - good uh now I'm going to
27:16 - uh shrink myself I don't think you can
27:18 - see me doing this
27:20 - live uh and crop myself a little bit on
27:22 - the
27:26 - right um so now this should be I'm kind
27:29 - of small but I think maybe that'll be
27:31 - good I'm a smaller
27:35 - now am I here do you see me I'm smaller
27:40 - is that okay is everything looking fine
27:43 - uh oh my YouTube
27:46 - froze ah oh no no no no it didn't
27:49 - freeze it's just behind Okay I gotta
27:54 - get okay everyone here we go we're gonna
27:56 - do this coding challenge
27:59 - look you can almost see my pants now in
28:00 - this shot I don't know how I got
28:02 - lower I am wearing pants in case you
28:05 - were
28:06 - wondering I do have legs ah there's
28:08 - water here everything's a disaster all
28:10 - of a sudden okay hold on here we go
28:11 - we're going to
28:14 - start where's oh I need a I have a
28:16 - little water spill on the table over
28:21 - here hold on you got to fix one thing
28:24 - here uh and everything's going to be be
28:28 - fine in one moment there we
28:33 - go okay
28:36 - and now I'm back okay here we
28:41 - go laptop is visible it is not visible
28:44 - anymore troll is not in sight um
28:48 - okay so I'm GNA start that
28:54 - timer and then I'm going to go
28:58 - hello welcome to another coding
29:00 - challenge with me Dan I don't know maybe
29:04 - you know my name maybe you don't I'm
29:05 - here to program this particular
29:08 - simulation from scratch so what this is
29:11 - is kind of like an infinite procedurally
29:13 - generated terrain it looks like you're
29:15 - flying over it so I'm going to use the
29:17 - processing programming environment it's
29:18 - a Java based environment you can get it
29:19 - at processing.org check the links for
29:22 - various things you might need in the
29:23 - description of this video but
29:25 - without further ado I'm going to get
29:28 - right I'm going to get started okay so
29:30 - I'm going to close this out so what do I
29:32 - need um so first of all I have a sketch
29:34 - setup I've got setup and I've got draw
29:36 - size and background that's the only
29:37 - thing so I've got this blank canvas
29:39 - right now and notice in setup I'm also
29:41 - using p3d because I need a 3D
29:43 - environment so what I need before I can
29:46 - really do anything is I need to make the
29:49 - terrain itself as just like a
29:52 - flat grid so how does that work
29:56 - basically um I could draw a giant
29:59 - rectangle and that would be my terrain
30:01 - but instead of drawing a giant rectangle
30:03 - what I want to draw is a lot of tiny
30:06 - rectangles next to each other and I'm
30:08 - saying rectangle and I guess I really
30:09 - mean
30:10 - square like this because I want my
30:12 - terrain to be lots and lots of shapes
30:15 - all attached to each other and next to
30:17 - each other and in fact a good way to do
30:19 - this in 3D is to use something called a
30:22 - triangle
30:23 - strip
30:26 - triangle strip you know what this means
30:29 - is I can say vertex vertex vertex vertex
30:33 - vertex vertex vertex vertex over and
30:36 - over again and what the computer is
30:39 - going to do is connect all these
30:40 - vertices with triangles triangular
30:43 - polygons and all connected together
30:45 - you'll see this appearance of a mesh and
30:47 - then what I'm going to do is once I have
30:50 - this mesh is I'm going to take each
30:52 - point as this is where my screen right
30:54 - this flat whiteboard is my screen I'm
30:56 - going to extrude some them pull them out
30:58 - some of them are going to get pulled
30:59 - higher some of them are going to get
31:01 - pulled lower so it's has a mountainous
31:03 - like quality so before I can get that
31:05 - part though I just need this triangular
31:07 - mesh to appear in the window so let's
31:10 - first make that happen so the way to
31:13 - make that happen is I need to have a
31:15 - nested Loop right for every single point
31:17 - on this grid so I'm going to start with
31:19 - x equals z x x is less than and I'm
31:22 - going to need to have know how many
31:23 - columns and how many rows so I'm going
31:25 - to say x is less than columns and then
31:27 - I'm I'm going to say y equal 0 Y is less
31:29 - than
31:31 - rows okay so now columns and rows don't
31:35 - exist as variables so I'm going to add
31:37 - them columns rows and what I'm going to
31:40 - do is also I need to figure out a good
31:43 - variable that I'm going to need is how
31:45 - big is each of these squares how many
31:47 - pixels wide how many pixels high and
31:48 - it'll be the same number let's make that
31:51 - 20 so I'm going to add another variable
31:53 - I've got this timer going I've doing
31:54 - this for two I see how long this takes
31:55 - so hopefully not more than 30 minutes
31:57 - I'm going to make a variable called kind
32:00 - of standing for
32:02 - scale and uh I'm going to set that equal
32:06 - to 20 and I'm really keeping an eye on
32:07 - my audio to make sure the audio doesn't
32:09 - cut out okay uh okay so now what am I
32:14 - doing okay so first just to make sure
32:16 - things are working uh what I'm going to
32:19 - do is I'm going to uh have some sort of
32:22 - arbitrary width and
32:24 - height uh and I'm going to make those
32:26 - the same as the window just for now it's
32:28 - going to change later I'm just sort of
32:30 - being simple about things and then I'm
32:31 - going to the the number of columns is
32:35 - the width of the width of my grid
32:37 - divided by that scale and the number of
32:39 - rows is the height of my grid divided by
32:41 - that scale and just to make sure things
32:43 - are working let's just draw a rectangle
32:45 - a rectangle at where x times scale y
32:49 - times scale and at that size and I'm
32:52 - going to say stroke
32:54 - 255 and no fill so what I should have so
32:58 - far if things are working right is a the
33:01 - a perfect grid so this is a good sign I
33:03 - now have this grid but I can't draw it
33:06 - as rectangles to yeah I could but to
33:08 - manipulate it to make it a Terrain to
33:10 - make it all bumpy I want these to be
33:13 - triangles a triangle strip so I'm going
33:15 - to change what I'm doing and I'm going
33:17 - to say now let's think about this H my
33:19 - triangle strip now I could have my
33:20 - triangles go down but mentally it's just
33:24 - easier for me to think of everything as
33:26 - rows so I want to do the top row next
33:29 - row next row next row next row next row
33:31 - of triangles so I need the outer loop to
33:34 - be y because first start with Y do all
33:36 - the X's go to the next y do all the X's
33:39 - so I I realized I want to take this y
33:41 - row and and put this as the outer loop
33:44 - and then what I need to do is for every
33:47 - each row will be its own triangle strip
33:50 - so by the way where is this coming from
33:52 - I'm going to go to uh processing.org
33:55 - under uh reference and and under um
33:59 - begin shape I know I'm going to zoom in
34:02 - here see so what I'm doing is I'm using
34:04 - begin shape and end shape which allows
34:06 - you to set a bunch of vertices and you
34:07 - get a shape but if I scroll down this is
34:09 - really what I want I want this triangle
34:11 - strip so I want to send a set a whole
34:13 - bunch of vertices and have it all
34:15 - connected magically with triangles okay
34:17 - so now I should be able to if I go back
34:19 - to the
34:20 - code uh say for every single row begin
34:25 - shape and then end shape
34:28 - shape and ah of course I don't want to
34:31 - just say generic begin shape I want to
34:33 - say begin shape and what I'm intending
34:35 - to make is a triangle strip and then
34:37 - instead of making
34:39 - rectangles what I need what I what I
34:42 - what I want to do is just set and I'm
34:44 - going to uh set this up here the stroke
34:46 - and fill outside just to instead of
34:49 - drawing rectangles what I want to do is
34:50 - set
34:53 - vertices so the first vert vertex is
34:57 - going to be at x * scale y * scale and
35:00 - it's going across so if I were to just
35:02 - run this right now I should I'm just
35:04 - getting these lines across because I
35:06 - didn't actually make the triangles what
35:08 - I need to do is create the vertices like
35:11 - this what I just did was set vertices
35:13 - like this vertex vertex vertex vertex
35:15 - vertex vertex I need to do vert up down
35:18 - up down up down up down up down so I
35:21 - need to do Y and Y + one for each
35:25 - Loop uh so how do I do that uh I just
35:29 - all I need to do is add another vertex
35:32 - y + 1 time scale there we go this should
35:37 - work please
35:39 - work there we go so now you can see I
35:41 - have this beautiful mesh of triangles so
35:44 - this is the building block from which I
35:47 - can that I can manipulate now it doesn't
35:49 - look very 3D I've done everything in 2D
35:52 - right now so let's at least take a
35:54 - moment to rotate it on an axis so so if
35:57 - I if I right now you're seeing where's a
36:00 - prop you're this is my Kleenex you're
36:03 - seeing this and it's just flat facing
36:05 - you I want to rotate it like this so it
36:07 - looks like you're flying over it so to
36:09 - do that we want to rotate along what
36:11 - axis this is the x axis I want to rotate
36:13 - along this x axis so I'm going to say
36:16 - right here rotate X and like Pi ided 3
36:20 - which is like 180 60° so if I run
36:25 - this where did it go so we've got some
36:28 - problems here the issue is I've drawn
36:30 - everything relative to the top left so
36:32 - if everything's drawn relative to the
36:34 - top left everything is rotating around
36:36 - the top left and I've just rotated it
36:37 - completely out of view so what I need to
36:39 - do is have everything drawn relative to
36:42 - the center of the
36:46 - window so I should translate to the
36:48 - center ah look there it is and I can see
36:50 - it now I can see this plane that I might
36:52 - be traveling over but it's shifted often
36:54 - to the right it's because 0 0 is in the
36:56 - center which is what I want but the
36:59 - triangles start at 0 0 so remember I
37:02 - have this variable and this should I'm
37:04 - going to make these Global variables uh
37:06 - W and H I I want every single triangle
37:09 - to be like offset back by that width
37:12 - divided by two so if I go back to here I
37:15 - can I wonder if I I could probably
37:17 - actually just do a whole another
37:18 - translation let's just do another
37:20 - translation of negative width after I
37:22 - rotate width divided by two negative
37:25 - height divided two I think that will do
37:27 - the trick
37:29 - and there we go so this is what I want I
37:31 - now have this almost infinite it's not
37:33 - infinite but I have this terrain of
37:35 - triangles that is on an angle map look
37:37 - at this I'm only at 8 minutes this could
37:39 - possibly be done in 12 I should never
37:41 - say how long this is going to take
37:42 - because it's only going to take longer
37:43 - but we're doing really well now what is
37:46 - what do I need to do here well I've
37:49 - really gotten super far the only thing I
37:51 - need to do is take each one of those and
37:53 - like pull some of the vertic ver
37:55 - vertices up so let's just do something
37:57 - goofy like let's make all of them random
38:00 - so how do I pull them up well each
38:02 - vertex only has an X and A Y right
38:04 - remember this
38:06 - is this is the mesh that I'm drawing
38:10 - it's exactly this but just turns on its
38:12 - side but if I want to take this point
38:14 - and pull it up a little bit so when it's
38:16 - turn on its side it looks like it's
38:17 - going up along the Y AIS it's really
38:19 - changing the Z the Z value the Z value
38:22 - for all of those vertices has been zero
38:24 - all along so let's go now and say what
38:28 - if I were to do like random negative 100
38:31 - 100 for all the Z
38:35 - values what's going to happen here let's
38:37 - run this and see look at that okay one
38:41 - you see it's kind of going crazy let's
38:43 - 100 I guess was too much let's make it
38:45 - rant between -10 and 10 let's run it
38:48 - again there you can see that I now have
38:51 - this mesh and you know maybe I'll make
38:53 - the frame
38:55 - rate rate one
38:57 - so you can kind of like just sort of
38:59 - catch it for a second is it running yeah
39:02 - oops that didn't happen hey is frame
39:04 - rate broken in uh look at that I wonder
39:07 - if frame rate is broken in um p3d that's
39:10 - really weird I don't know why that's not
39:11 - working I'm GNA have to investigate that
39:13 - and might maybe file a bug report um so
39:16 - but anyway that's neither here nor there
39:18 - the point of what you're seeing is this
39:20 - now has this quality of a Terrain
39:22 - because each point is higher or lower
39:24 - now the issue is I need to have some
39:26 - consistent way of doing
39:28 - so I think what would be useful is for
39:31 - me to have a data structure that stores
39:33 - all the Z values right the um the X and
39:37 - Y values the X and Y
39:40 - values light is I knocked over a light
39:42 - the X and Y values and I'm probably G to
39:45 - have everything messed up now the X and
39:47 - Y Val physical comedy or that's not
39:50 - really comedy just physical mishaps the
39:52 - X and Y values are fixed they're never
39:54 - going to change the zv values however
39:57 - might change there's some sort of
39:59 - variable calculated procedure or some
40:00 - algorithm has to generate those Z values
40:02 - so I need another data structure to keep
40:04 - track of all those Z values and what I
40:06 - think I would like to do is use a
40:07 - two-dimensional array a two-dimensional
40:09 - array would allow me to store for every
40:12 - single uh spot here some zv value
40:15 - calculated According to some to some
40:19 - algorithm so let's go back and I'm going
40:22 - to come back to here and I'm going to
40:24 - say uh and I'm going to make these
40:26 - floating Point values
40:28 - so this is a two diim this is how I in
40:30 - in Java in processing how I Define a
40:31 - two-dimensional array and I'm going to
40:33 - call it I don't know what to call it uh
40:36 - landscape terrain I'll call it terrain
40:39 - is a new uh and you know what I I need
40:43 - the two-dimensional array to have the
40:46 - have the number of spots as the number
40:47 - of column and rows so I want to actually
40:49 - initialize it after I calculate the
40:51 - columns and rows and so a
40:54 - two-dimensional array with this many
40:56 - columns and this many rows now what can
40:58 - I do but I can actually in setup right
41:02 - now I could just say I equals I'll use x
41:06 - again X and you know I just need this
41:07 - exact sorry same nested
41:13 - Loop and instead of drawing anything
41:16 - what I'm doing here is I'm saying uh
41:18 - terrain index X index y equals some
41:21 - random value there we go so now I'm
41:25 - picking a random set of values in
41:29 - setup and then here instead of drawing
41:32 - them as random I'm going to say get
41:34 - those Z values I want the zv value at XY
41:38 - and then what do I want
41:39 - here I want the zv value at x y + one
41:43 - remember I'm doing vertex vertex vertex
41:46 - vertex so I need those zv values at Y
41:48 - and Y + one so now if I run this we
41:51 - should see uh whoops I got an error
41:53 - array out of bounds exception oh okay so
41:56 - of course I got an array out of bounds
41:57 - exception because I'm doing every single
41:59 - row and the row below it and when I get
42:01 - to the bottom there's no row below it so
42:03 - I need to say rows minus one for this
42:06 - loop I can only go to the second to last
42:07 - row so now if I run this again we should
42:10 - have there we go so now you can see I've
42:12 - got the terrain and it doesn't you can
42:15 - see that it's not like a Terrain that's
42:16 - filling my view but that's sort of an
42:18 - easy problem to solve because you know I
42:20 - have that's why I have these variables
42:22 - here I can say well let's just make it
42:23 - much wider and much longer and now I
42:26 - have my ter filling my view so how do I
42:29 - make it look though like I'm flying over
42:31 - it and have it appear
42:34 - infinite tricky question well here's a
42:37 - way to do it there's a bunch of
42:39 - different strategies and maybe I'll make
42:40 - another video that picks up right from
42:42 - here to do different ways but I'm going
42:44 - to use something you can see this random
42:46 - terrain is not so great like it doesn't
42:48 - really look very much like a mountainous
42:51 - like quality what I want is something
42:53 - that's more organic fractal-like nature
42:56 - like so to speak and what I could do is
42:58 - use something called pein noise so let's
43:00 - I have a separate video which I think I
43:02 - go over pein noise that I'll link to but
43:04 - I'm going to just briefly discuss what
43:06 - how pein noise would work in this
43:08 - context and I am I don't know what time
43:11 - I'm at but I'm going to keep going okay
43:12 - so pearlin
43:15 - noise pearlin noise is a way of getting
43:18 - smooth random numbers meaning random
43:21 - numbers if I think of random numbers in
43:23 - one
43:25 - dimension random numbers that I might
43:28 - ask for over time that are similar to
43:30 - the one I picked before it so if I want
43:33 - to get kind of a whole if I wanted to
43:36 - move something around the screen kind of
43:37 - fluidly I could use pear and noise to
43:40 - pick its location
43:43 - but what I want to do is actually use
43:45 - two-dimensional Pearl and noise meaning
43:47 - think of a space of numbers in two
43:52 - Dimensions so if I have a checkerboard
43:55 - and I were just to pick a random number
43:57 - number between 0 and 10 or between
43:59 - negative and 10 for every spot on the
44:01 - checker board I would get exactly this
44:04 - every single spot on this board is a
44:06 - random terrain value but that's not what
44:08 - I want what I want is to pick a zv value
44:11 - for here and then I want all the values
44:13 - around it to be somewhat similar to it
44:16 - and then for this one I want all the
44:17 - values around it to be somewhat similar
44:19 - to it so as things move up and down they
44:22 - move up and down smoothly so I think
44:24 - this probably merits a longer discussion
44:26 - about cing noise I'll refer you to my
44:28 - other video and ask questions in the
44:29 - comments and maybe I'll make one that
44:31 - demonstrates this more specifically uh
44:34 - uh maybe video sort of just about this
44:36 - idea but I'm going to kind of move on
44:37 - from that that being the sort of
44:38 - conceptual idea now how does it
44:41 - work if I call the noise function in
44:44 - processing there is a noise function in
44:46 - processing noise the word noise really
44:48 - means Randomness like audio
44:50 - noise but uh random in processing means
44:54 - Randomness noise means pearlin noise
44:56 - named for Ken pein who invented this
44:58 - particular algorithm
45:00 - now noise if I give it two noise
45:03 - whenever I call the no by behind the
45:05 - scenes when you start processing it's
45:07 - almost as if this infinite plane of
45:09 - numbers was created in two Dimensions
45:11 - with noise values available to you um
45:14 - and you can give it any particular XY
45:17 - value and get a particular noise value
45:20 - and this function will always give you a
45:22 - value between zero and one so actually
45:25 - something that I can just do right now
45:27 - now it's going to look a little bit
45:28 - weird is I could just go in here and I
45:30 - can say uh here instead of using random
45:34 - what I want to do is use the noise
45:35 - function and just give me a noise value
45:38 - for every X and
45:39 - Y and then I also want to map the noise
45:44 - value which goes between zero and one to
45:46 - some value between like negative 100 and
45:48 - 100 so let's run this now and see what I
45:52 - get so this is starting to look a little
45:55 - bit better and you know I could
45:58 - I'm going to just make it a little less
46:01 - tall this is starting to look a little
46:03 - bit better maybe there is a slight more
46:05 - consistency to this but it's still
46:07 - pretty random and the reason why it's
46:10 - still pretty random is that the numbers
46:12 - that I picked right I'm asking for noise
46:14 - at Z 0 and then I'm asking for noise at
46:16 - 1 comma 0 then noise at 2 comma 0 you
46:19 - know down here I'm asking for noise at 2
46:22 - comma 1 I'm I'm making a big leap into
46:25 - the noise space with with these whole
46:27 - integer numbers and actually the noise
46:29 - algorithm wants you to use small
46:31 - gradation so the actual pixel XY values
46:35 - doesn't really work very well for to to
46:37 - act to be the values that are passed
46:38 - into the noise function so the way I'm
46:40 - going to do that instead is by creating
46:44 - my own variable I'm going to say x
46:46 - offset as a float starting at zero and
46:50 - that should actually go in here and I'm
46:52 - going to say y offset as a float
46:55 - starting at zero X offset y offset and
46:59 - then I'm going to use those
47:01 - values for the noise function as the
47:04 - things I going to pass through and then
47:06 - I don't have to live with the X 0 plus
47:08 - one plus plus plus one I can increment
47:10 - those separately so here I can say
47:12 - something like X offset equals 0 point
47:15 - 0.01 and uh that's what I want to do
47:18 - inside this Loop and then after that
47:20 - Loop for every y I want to increase that
47:22 - by
47:23 - 0.01 so we can see now that my value is
47:26 - whoa so whoops uh camera went off um you
47:29 - can see now that my noise is much too
47:32 - smooth I move I'm moving so slowly my
47:35 - gradations within the noise noise space
47:37 - are so small that the actual terrain is
47:40 - very very flat so let's change that to
47:42 - like 0.1 and point1 and see how that
47:45 - does much better you can start to see I
47:47 - have this sort of smooth smooth
47:49 - mountainous region now oh we're really
47:51 - getting something this is much better um
47:53 - and maybe I can increase this now to
47:56 - sort of make some of the mountains a
47:57 - little bit higher you can see ooo that's
47:59 - pretty good too and I could also even go
48:01 - through it faster and maybe shrink this
48:04 - down to 100 you know I I I have a a
48:07 - problem where I tend to play with like
48:08 - values forever but you can start you can
48:09 - see now that we're getting something
48:11 - much more like actual terrain because I
48:13 - have these smooth random values so now
48:15 - I've got this terrain that appears
48:17 - somewhat infinite like I'm flying over
48:19 - it but I'm not moving over it well
48:21 - here's the kind of amazing thing so I
48:24 - could start going down the road of like
48:26 - camera work and translation and then
48:27 - like adding to the end of it as I'm
48:29 - flying over it but with pearl and noise
48:32 - there's a really really quick trick that
48:34 - I can do let's think about how this
48:36 - might work right remember this is my
48:39 - flat terrain and I have the noise values
48:41 - so the noise values are getting picked
48:44 - based on
48:46 - um based on uh X off which are the
48:51 - values along the x axis and yof which
48:54 - are the values along the x- axis
48:57 - what if my X offset values never change
49:00 - I want to fly this way right I want to
49:02 - fly over it I want to fly along the Y
49:05 - AIS y off always starts at zero what if
49:09 - where Y starts just changed a little bit
49:11 - each time so that the top the what I'm
49:14 - seeing far off in the distance start to
49:16 - appear as if it's moving closer so
49:17 - nothing's actually moving I'm just
49:19 - adjusting the noise I'm moving the noise
49:21 - space along where I'm starting in the
49:23 - that that two-dimensional plane of noise
49:26 - so if if I come back here now I've got
49:28 - to recalculate this in draw so I've got
49:31 - to take this whole Loop in draw I'll
49:34 - just put it at the
49:36 - beginning and I'm going to run
49:39 - it so it looks the same now all I need
49:42 - to do is say okay this value needs to
49:45 - change not start at zero every single
49:47 - time so I need another uh I'm going to
49:50 - create a variable called
49:52 - Flying and it's going to be zero and I'm
49:56 - going to have y offset start at flying
49:58 - and in every cycle through draw flying
50:01 - is going to increase a little
50:04 - bit oh I'm flying backwards so let's
50:08 - have flying decrease a little
50:12 - bit and now I'm flying forwards although
50:14 - it almost doesn't look like I'm flying
50:16 - it looks just like it's undulating but I
50:18 - I would I'm pretty sure if I make this a
50:20 - lot
50:21 - faster it's going to appear much more
50:23 - like I'm flying so you can see there's
50:25 - some goofiness happening in the back
50:26 - background has kind of a nice effect I
50:28 - probably if I extended how much I'm
50:30 - drawing further out uh for example if I
50:33 - made this like
50:35 - 1600 and uh you know I could also think
50:38 - about uh translating a little bit down
50:41 - so that it's a little bit lower I think
50:42 - plus 50 would do that um you know now I
50:45 - need to make it wider if I'm extending
50:47 - it further out I gotta stop tinkering
50:49 - with this I'll let you Tinker this with
50:51 - tinker tinker tinker with this yourself
50:55 - but um changing the the you can sort of
50:57 - see now that it's almost as if there's a
51:00 - curved world and the mountains are like
51:01 - pump appearing over so I think if you
51:03 - play with the values to play play with
51:05 - the positioning play with the rotation
51:07 - you can and also of course play with the
51:08 - color you don't have to draw this as a
51:10 - mesh you can do a variative things with
51:13 - this so I'm hoping this helped you
51:15 - understand a little bit a about how 3D
51:17 - works and 3D shapes Works a little bit
51:19 - more about pear and noise and also just
51:22 - sort of some creative exploration for
51:23 - what you might be able to do with this
51:25 - and what types of projects you might be
51:26 - to make so thanks for I was just
51:28 - checking to see if the audio was still
51:30 - working and I had a panic moment where
51:31 - it wasn't but thank you for watching
51:33 - this was about 22 minutes and I think I
51:34 - made this example in 22 minutes which
51:36 - I'm very pleased about okay and I'll see
51:38 - you soon uh talk to you later bye
51:42 - bye okay that was the end of that it is
51:45 - 3:56 which is perfect timing I need to
51:47 - get going in about five or 10 minutes so
51:49 - I'll stick around for a little bit if
51:50 - anyone has any questions that they want
51:52 - to
51:53 - ask um oh yeah um getting a Langston's a
51:58 - ant requested uh I feel ple I feel like
52:01 - this morning with the GitHub tutorials
52:03 - was kind of a bit of a mess like this
52:05 - was a little bit more smooth so uh and I
52:08 - think this worked well for me to have an
52:10 - example that I kind of like had made
52:12 - before so I and figure a few things out
52:15 - so I know how it's going to work but not
52:17 - actually really like have done I I still
52:19 - had to figure it out while I was doing
52:21 - it because I didn't have exactly in my
52:22 - head
52:24 - um okay oh I'm I'm so pleased that
52:27 - people seem to like this
52:29 - one uh uh in in Twitch in the twitch
52:32 - chat Galva Bart asks what course is this
52:35 - from so this is not from any course this
52:38 - is just me making arbitrary YouTube
52:40 - tutorials for things you can make with
52:42 - processing in p5js however I will
52:44 - mention that I think I that just went
52:47 - live this really goes along with um this
52:50 - course uh which uh is now an online
52:53 - course that you can sign up for that is
52:54 - supposedly open you should have gotten a
52:56 - welcome message you should be able to
52:57 - watch the videos of it now can I watch a
53:00 - video of it if I go here uh no um would
53:05 - I like to enroll I I don't want to like
53:06 - sign in on my account here because who
53:08 - knows what will happen but um this kind
53:10 - of goes along with this particular uh
53:12 - course if you're interested uh on
53:14 - cad.com
53:16 - all right uh any other questions in the
53:19 - chat so um oh does the order of the
53:22 - nested Loops okay sorry Andrew Kim asks
53:25 - does the order of the nest Loops matter
53:27 - I noticed you initially started the
53:28 - sketch with columns then rows within it
53:30 - but later switched it it doesn't
53:33 - actually um I mean you could do this
53:37 - exact program with going up or down um I
53:42 - just chose because I had a I what does
53:45 - matter is that I kind of know what I'm
53:47 - doing so that I'm consistent with how
53:49 - I'm doing various
53:51 - calculations so um because if I were
53:54 - going down I would need to do the
53:56 - vertices up down over over up down
54:00 - probably or up over down over so I I you
54:04 - know because I was doing the triangle
54:06 - strip up down up down up down I want to
54:09 - go across all the way across the row and
54:11 - then down so in that case y needs to be
54:14 - the outer loop but I could invert it and
54:16 - just change other things in my code and
54:18 - it would probably work just fine but I
54:20 - needed a mental model and I need to be
54:22 - consistent with that mental
54:23 - model um
54:26 - okay
54:29 - um oh I'm excited to see that
54:31 - everybody's already enrolled so um so uh
54:34 - uh this is I'm signing off for today I
54:36 - kind of just want to stay like this was
54:38 - this felt good when I do a tutorial that
54:39 - like works and I kind of like went
54:40 - through consistently it feels so good um
54:43 - but um uh I'm going to sign off for
54:46 - today because I'm going to go to a uh
54:48 - seven-year-old tennis class to watch
54:50 - some
54:50 - tennis um and
54:53 - um then uh but I will be back on
54:56 - Thursday morning probably around 11:
54:58 - Eastern um that seems to be a time
55:00 - that's working for me and it also seems
55:02 - to be good like west coast East Coast
55:03 - Europe seems to fit into that time frame
55:06 - somewhat reasonably but I would love to
55:08 - hear what times are most convenient for
55:09 - people and uh so Thursday I don't I
55:12 - might um maybe I'll consider doing
55:14 - another coding Challenge and some more
55:15 - git GitHub tutorials I kind of want to
55:18 - get back to the connect sound everyone's
55:20 - been asking for sound maybe I'll try to
55:21 - do sound on Thursday but tweet me your
55:23 - suggestions and votes maybe I'll do a
55:24 - Twitter poll uh that that sort of thing
55:26 - and I'll see you guys soon
55:30 - um um Matthew vanen huel ask can I self
55:35 - advertise my channel you absolutely can
55:37 - if you have a Channel with processing
55:38 - tutorials paste it in and I'll give it a
55:41 - shout out um uh terrain generation
55:44 - tutorials yeah I would be happy to do
55:46 - more 3D trees I would be happy to do
55:48 - caves so many good
55:50 - suggestions
55:52 - um um these are great suggestions from
55:54 - everybody so I got to keep a list of all
55:55 - this stuff and I look forward I I look
55:58 - forward to seeing you on the next live
55:59 - stream Thursday uh send me your tweets
56:02 - with questions and I can respond there
56:04 - um if you have complex you can also ask
56:06 - questions in the YouTube comments
56:08 - another good way to get in touch with a
56:10 - question is to post it to the processing
56:12 - forum and then tweet me the link to your
56:14 - Forum post um that's the easiest way if
56:16 - I'm going to get into a discussion where
56:18 - other people can chime in and with post
56:20 - pting code and that sort of thing um um
56:23 - and and that sort of thing okay um and
56:26 - I'll see you guys soon I I hate to shut
56:28 - this off but it's 4:00 and I've done
56:30 - this a total of three and a half hours
56:31 - today so I guess I should feel good
56:33 - about that
