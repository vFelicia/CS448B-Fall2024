00:02 - hello happy Friday good morning it's me
00:06 - dan Shipman live with the coding train
00:09 - and today is a special day is background
00:14 - research just to explain kind of loud
00:16 - but I kind of timed it so I started when
00:19 - there's only ten seconds left in this
00:20 - song well as everyone's kind of entering
00:22 - into this livestream just wait so
00:28 - today's a little bit different than my
00:29 - usual Friday's for a couple reasons one
00:32 - is let me just say on the outset that I
00:35 - have kind of a complicated schedule
00:37 - today yet I will be in this building for
00:39 - the whole day until at least 5 p.m.
00:41 - Eastern time which is about five out oh
00:46 - that's like six and a half hours or
00:49 - something like that but I do have all
00:51 - these like little appointments some of
00:52 - them for like 15 minutes some of them
00:53 - for an hour so I what I plan to do is
00:56 - kind of livestream my bagel oh wait I
00:57 - have to go pause stop I'm gonna leave
00:59 - I'll come back and turn it on again
01:02 - pause stop leave come back again so
01:05 - there's gonna be a probably a bunch of
01:06 - stopping and starting today ideally
01:08 - it'll just be you know a session now for
01:10 - an hour or so stop take a break come
01:12 - back and then another couple hours but
01:15 - we'll see I might have to stop and start
01:16 - at a moment's notice because I'm waiting
01:19 - for an important training schedule this
01:21 - important phone call that I have to deal
01:22 - with so I'm even more absurdly like kind
01:24 - of keeping an eye on my phone during the
01:26 - livestream today which is probably in
01:28 - some universe very unprofessional but
01:30 - this is by no means a professional
01:33 - operation nothing about this whatsoever
01:35 - is professional as evidenced by the fact
01:36 - that that camera will soon turn off and
01:38 - have to walk over there press a button
01:39 - but you know I also feel okay with doing
01:43 - this maybe I'm just trying to convince
01:44 - myself here because really my goal for
01:47 - the live streams is to just sort of
01:49 - expose the process of creating the
01:51 - tutorials but if you're really here to
01:52 - consume what might possibly be somewhat
01:55 - educational content you know it's
01:57 - certainly just wait for the edited
02:00 - videos that will come over the weekend
02:01 - or next week okay so I am not seeing
02:06 - anyone complain about sound or video or
02:08 - image now oh now that was one reason why
02:10 - today is a little bit different
02:13 - here's another reason why today is
02:15 - different I am doing a sponsored
02:18 - tutorial and the sponsor of this
02:20 - tutorial is a company called circle CI
02:25 - circle CI is a company that provides
02:28 - continuous integration as a service
02:32 - notice I'm not gonna drink any water
02:34 - today because I don't want our sponsors
02:36 - to compete with each other water and
02:37 - circle see hi this I just have some nice
02:41 - I'm also getting a cold which is not
02:43 - good because if I was really have a lot
02:45 - of content I want to do today but as
02:47 - many of you might remember well first of
02:50 - all I'm very accident-prone as evidenced
02:52 - by my completely now mostly healed
02:54 - broken arm in multiple places actually
02:57 - multiple broken arms anyway that's
02:58 - another story but I am an addition to
03:00 - being accident prone I'm very prone to
03:02 - the losing of the voice so I have to
03:04 - when I get a cold if this happened to me
03:07 - last year it was very extreme I'll I
03:09 - couldn't talk for like two or three
03:10 - weeks because I overdid it teaching and
03:13 - talking and presenting so we'll see I
03:14 - think I'm fine for today but if things
03:16 - start to go in terms of the vocal cords
03:18 - I might have to take some nice breaks
03:20 - and drink some more ginger tea alright
03:25 - so here's the thing this is kind of
03:28 - interesting because I am NOT somebody
03:31 - who knows very much at all or has
03:33 - experience with continuous integration
03:35 - or unit testing which is good which is a
03:39 - part of this discussion
03:40 - so I'm my intention is to make a few
03:43 - tutorials one is to talk about my sense
03:47 - of unit testing and integration what
03:50 - they what it is and why it's useful and
03:52 - look at a really simple kind of hello
03:54 - world example of a JavaScript program
03:57 - with unit testing and continuous
03:59 - integration using circle CI so there's
04:02 - gonna be a lot of node and github and
04:03 - JavaScript as part of this as well then
04:06 - I want to see if I can add some unit
04:09 - testing and continuous integration to
04:10 - the little matrix library that I was
04:12 - work that I've been working on for the
04:14 - neural network tutorials and then I
04:15 - might try to just do it a little fun
04:17 - extra bit to see what other kind of
04:18 - goofy things whatever strange little
04:20 - things we can get up to by having a
04:22 - process separate process run on a
04:25 - separate server
04:27 - every time we try to merge or commit or
04:29 - our code that sort of thing so um so
04:34 - that's the plan I really apologize who's
04:37 - a small chance at any moment I'm just
04:40 - gonna have to run for like 15 or 20
04:42 - minutes then come back and the stream I
04:43 - could leave it on but I don't think that
04:45 - makes sense I probably turn it off and
04:46 - restart it so I have to apologize in
04:48 - advance so here we go so I think I want
04:56 - to just jump right in
04:58 - there is also definitely a class going
05:00 - on in the room a runaway going knock on
05:02 - the wall so I might do a little less
05:04 - shouting hopefully which won't bother
05:06 - anybody
05:07 - I don't think so let me see let me get a
05:12 - little set up here because I'm going to
05:14 - need oh oh I should use AI term this
05:18 - would be a good day to use AI term but
05:20 - I'm not going to I'm just gonna use my
05:21 - old fashioned terminal but I'm really
05:25 - gonna need to use terminal for this so
05:28 - I'm gonna have terminal like as a thing
05:30 - over here that you can always see okay
05:35 - then I'm gonna need I'm gonna need our
05:41 - text editor Adam a hard text editor okay
05:48 - so I'm gonna make a folder called Circle
05:58 - C I test testing test testing test test
06:09 - testing test test that's the name of my
06:11 - project
06:12 - oh I can't do CD I've got to make that
06:14 - directory make directory testing test
06:18 - test okay CD testing test test and then
06:27 - I want to open that in Adam and close
06:33 - these snakes and ladders game okay I
06:37 - don't need any code in there I need
06:39 - coding train github
06:41 - just so small maybe I can just do this
06:44 - for right now but the problem is I need
06:47 - to be able to see this button over here
06:48 - that'll be fine
06:49 - then I've got this the cameras are about
06:51 - to shut off was that one already did a
06:54 - testing test test and add them okay so
06:57 - let's start with this open all right
07:03 - cameras back on
07:07 - and so I'm just gonna
07:11 - you can barely believe this where we
07:12 - even like am I signed into the right
07:14 - accounts I'm being asked in the slack
07:17 - channel by the way if you're wondering
07:18 - the slack channel is in a channel for
07:21 - patrons of the coding train where you
07:24 - can talk about if you want and ask
07:25 - questions and get a little help and Oh
07:28 - before I begin let me thank a couple
07:30 - people let me thank fun fun function mpj
07:35 - i did watch his videos about testing and
07:39 - circle CI over the course of this week
07:41 - hopefully I won't by accident just be
07:43 - repeating the things he says different
07:45 - voice about his videos are awesome I
07:47 - love his goofy like coffee stick and
07:50 - like oh I need some I need some good
07:51 - coffee stick I mean I've watched his
07:52 - videos before but I think I've always
07:54 - just been watching them in bits and
07:54 - pieces I was really watching them all
07:56 - the way through and they're quite
07:57 - wonderful a really nice approach lovely
08:00 - studio going to support going get get
08:02 - out of here right now and go and watch
08:04 - some videos from mtj perhaps about unit
08:07 - testing and continuous integration
08:08 - hopefully mine will be a little bit more
08:10 - basic a little bit more big even
08:12 - beginner-friendly than what he's doing
08:14 - which is kind of like is it launching
08:16 - more into using it with like a more
08:18 - complex web app alright just a fork of
08:23 - atom that has a train in the corner what
08:26 - what what coding train text editor okay
08:35 - alright um I'm just gonna check to see
08:39 - if this is the thing that I have to go
08:42 - do right now it doesn't seem to be a
08:45 - thing so I'm assuming it's good I'm
08:47 - gonna be good til 11:30 okay which is 45
08:50 - minutes from now all right
08:54 - we see this cold not good
09:05 - wake up audience all right all right
09:16 - here we go got a marker got a tissue
09:20 - I've got the coding train get up I do
09:22 - want to be logged into my account I
09:23 - think that's just gonna make the most
09:25 - sense all right so this first this first
09:29 - tutorial I'm going to try to explain
09:30 - unit testing and and actually let me get
09:34 - a couple URLs open because I think this
09:37 - will be useful okay so that's p5 yeah
09:49 - that's fine yeah great okay I need that
09:51 - URL as well okay here we go yes maybe it
10:03 - makes sense for me to have this here on
10:09 - my opening screen hello welcome to a
10:12 - special tutorial thing on the coding
10:16 - train with me I don't need to introduce
10:18 - myself I mean I probably should but
10:19 - anyway so I've been over time making
10:24 - lots of different already no no this is
10:30 - terrible hello welcome to a special
10:35 - tutorial on the coding train so this
10:38 - tutorial is about wow this this series
10:42 - I'm probably gonna be two or three or
10:44 - four or five and eventually thousands of
10:46 - videos long about unit testing and
10:48 - continuous integration and on this
10:51 - tutorial series these three videos that
10:53 - about three that I think I've got to
10:54 - make or sponsored by circle CI which is
10:57 - a company that provides a service called
10:59 - continuous integration and you might be
11:01 - wondering
11:01 - ah what is continuous integration and
11:03 - hopefully after you watch these videos
11:04 - you will think
11:06 - what is contagious haha continuous
11:08 - integration so and I actually admit and
11:10 - I should say that's right at the outset
11:12 - that the idea of continuous integration
11:14 - and really unit testing while not
11:16 - completely new to me is not something
11:18 - that's part of my practice or workflow
11:20 - but it is something that I would like to
11:22 - aspire to have more of in the future and
11:25 - actually I was I've been way off in my
11:28 - thinking in it that I've realized in
11:30 - learning and researching about this that
11:32 - it was something that would get in the
11:33 - way of my development and making of
11:36 - projects in a kind of creative rapid
11:38 - prototyping way and in fact it's
11:40 - something that I think can be so useful
11:42 - and and make contributing to open source
11:46 - a friendlier and easier experience now
11:49 - hopefully by the end of the videos I'm
11:52 - going to make by the end I'm gonna well
11:54 - I proven I don't know proven well I've
11:56 - made the case for that but let's see if
11:58 - we can do that so what is so so before
12:02 - let's where am I going before I even
12:05 - talk about continuous integration ah
12:11 - let's talk about something called unit
12:18 - dried out marker let's talk about
12:21 - something called unit testing and I
12:28 - would also recommend watching mpj fun
12:31 - fun function has some great videos about
12:33 - these same topics and npj says which
12:35 - kind of clicked into my head that unit
12:37 - testing you can think of a piece of
12:38 - software as a bunch of separate units
12:42 - right you've got this big complex idea
12:44 - you to break it into little parts
12:46 - solve all those little parts and unit
12:48 - testing these units is the idea of
12:49 - testing each one of those parts to make
12:51 - sure they're working individually on
12:52 - their own so that if you have a big code
12:55 - base and you change one thing here but
12:57 - don't realize it's gonna break this
12:58 - other unit testing his way of saying I
13:01 - made this code I can feel confident that
13:03 - everything is still working that I
13:05 - haven't broken my code so that's what
13:07 - unit testing is for and in fact unit
13:10 - testing is something that's used in a
13:11 - lot of open-source libraries and
13:14 - projects for example
13:16 - the probably the place where I first
13:18 - encountered unit testing and wrote my
13:20 - first unit tests was is for the project
13:23 - p5.js itself so this is the p5.js
13:26 - library this is the repository for that
13:29 - I use and a lot of my almost all of my
13:32 - coding challenges and tutorials and one
13:34 - thing you'll notice here is that look at
13:36 - this there's this nice folder called
13:37 - source so I don't want to get too off
13:39 - topic here but what's interesting about
13:41 - p5 you might know p5 you might remember
13:43 - p5 as the library file called p5.js or
13:46 - p5 dot min Duchess but if you're working
13:49 - on p5 you're not working on this giant
13:51 - library file there's a build process
13:53 - there's actually all these smaller
13:56 - source files write folders with
13:59 - different JavaScript files that get
14:01 - bundled and packaged into the JavaScript
14:03 - library so for example if I look in this
14:06 - math folder here and I look here under
14:09 - file if I say I'm gonna look under
14:11 - random uh-oh pause timeout oh okay okay
14:18 - sorry so I this is so I should have just
14:27 - started later because I had a feeling
14:29 - this was gonna happen but then I didn't
14:30 - want to lose all the time so I
14:32 - unfortunately have to go and I expect to
14:36 - be back in about 15 or 20 minutes we'll
14:39 - just consider this practice I'm gonna
14:41 - come back to exactly where I was right
14:42 - now so I will be right I'm so sorry
14:45 - about that it looks like terrible that
14:47 - I'm actually doing something from
14:48 - sponsored content but but so I'm really
14:53 - sorry about this but I'm I this is just
14:55 - a important thing that I have to do I am
15:02 - leaving the microphone or I will also
15:10 - probably on this page like put a time up
15:12 - when I know when I'm getting back it's
15:14 - really just a phone call I'll be back in
15:15 - 15 20 minutes okay thank you everybody
15:17 - yes I knew this is terrible
