00:00 - Hello.
00:01 - I am back and I am ready to
start another little series
00:04 - of videos inside a
larger series of videos,
00:06 - and the topic here is arrays--
00:08 - an array in JavaScript.
00:10 - What is an array?
00:11 - Why do you want to use one?
00:12 - What's the syntax for an array?
00:14 - What kind of things can
you do with an array?
00:16 - And ultimately, I
have a goal with this.
00:17 - So if you remember recently,
in a previous video--
00:20 - it was actually a couple
weeks ago when I recorded it,
00:22 - but who knows how
you're watching these--
00:24 - I recorded a video where we
looked at making an object--
00:27 - an object as this
collection of properties.
00:29 - This thing that maybe has an x
and a y and a color and a size,
00:32 - and then this idea
that you could put
00:34 - a function inside the object.
00:35 - So that thing that has a bunch
of properties could also--
00:38 - you could issue
commands to it like move
00:40 - or draw yourself
or change color.
00:42 - And so if you can
get one object--
00:44 - like this object,
which I'm now telling
00:47 - it to move and balance and
display itself as a circle--
00:51 - if I could take
that single object,
00:52 - how could I easily duplicate
that object every time I,
00:55 - say, click the mouse?
00:57 - Click, click,
click, click, click.
00:59 - The idea here, and I
have this list of videos
01:01 - that I'd like to
make all the way up
01:03 - to number four
which will really go
01:05 - through all the pieces of this.
01:07 - So how does an array
even work to have
01:09 - a list of these objects?
01:11 - How do you then have
the object in the array?
01:14 - How do you deal with
making multiple copies
01:16 - of that object in the array?
01:17 - How do you deal with
adding the objects
01:19 - to the array one at a time?
01:20 - These are all the pieces
that I would like to get to,
01:22 - and then I have a few
other topics like clicking,
01:24 - how to interact with an
object by clicking or moving
01:27 - the mouse, or how to
have two objects interact
01:29 - with each other.
01:29 - So this is the full scope of
the videos I'd like to make.
01:32 - There are six of them.
01:33 - I'm hoping they'll each
be about 10 minutes.
01:34 - And I'm going to
get right started
01:36 - right now with the first
one-- what is an array?
01:38 - So let's move this
out of here, and I'm
01:41 - going to come over here
to my trusty whiteboard.
01:45 - It's very friendly to me.
01:46 - It talks to me because nobody--
01:48 - I talk to a whiteboard now.
01:50 - That's what I do.
01:51 - I used to talk to the camera.
01:52 - Now I talk to the whiteboard.
01:53 - OK.
01:53 - So what is an array?
01:54 - Why do you want to use one?
01:55 - Well, let's dial ourselves
back to a happy, warm,
01:58 - and comfortable place.
02:01 - I could say something
like var num equals five.
02:06 - It's very high on
this whiteboard,
02:08 - but I think you can read it.
02:09 - This is comfortable.
02:10 - I have a variable, the name
I made up for it is num,
02:13 - and its value is five.
02:14 - So if I wanted to
have a second one,
02:16 - I could add a second
variable, but here's
02:18 - another way I could have a
second number that I'm storing.
02:21 - var nums equals square
bracket 5 comma 3 end square
02:28 - bracket semicolon.
02:30 - So an array is a list of
values, separated by commas,
02:37 - embedded inside of open
and closed square brackets.
02:40 - This is not that dissimilar,
strangely enough,
02:44 - to this idea we
have an object which
02:47 - is a collection of name
value pairs, right,
02:53 - inside curly brackets.
02:55 - So both of these
are collections--
02:58 - lists in a way.
02:59 - Lists of name value pairs,
lists of just values.
03:02 - And that distinction,
I think, will
03:04 - become more and more clear.
03:05 - Even though it seems a
little confusing right now--
03:07 - why would I use
one or the other--
03:09 - as I start to show
you more and more
03:10 - uses of them in
different examples,
03:12 - you'll see what
that distinction is.
03:14 - But the key distinction right
now that's super important
03:17 - is that the order of this list--
03:19 - the order of the
array-- is what matters.
03:22 - Elements in array have an index.
03:24 - They're the first element
or the third element
03:26 - or the last element or
the element in the middle.
03:28 - That ability to have
the elements in an order
03:31 - is the sort of crucial
key aspect of an array.
03:33 - So for example,
this is element--
03:35 - well, it looks like it's
the first element, right,
03:37 - because it's the first
thing in the array
03:39 - and that's the second thing.
03:40 - But in programming, often
you have to start counting--
03:45 - I'm stuttering here because I'm
afraid to tell you this news--
03:49 - but you have to start
counting from zero.
03:51 - And actually, it's a wonderful
thing to count from zero.
03:53 - Everyone in lots of--
03:54 - we should all just
count from zero.
03:56 - It brings joy to the
world, but it also
03:59 - brings a little
bit of confusion.
04:00 - So this is index zero, and
this is index number one.
04:05 - It's kind of not that
great of an example.
04:07 - Let's make a bigger array.
04:08 - 50, 71, 12--
04:11 - I could put a negative number
in there-- negative 22.
04:14 - This element, now, has how
many-- this array, sorry,
04:16 - has how many elements?
04:18 - Four elements.
04:19 - What are its index values?
04:21 - Zero, one, two, three.
04:26 - So this is important-- an array
might have four elements in it,
04:32 - but the index values
go from zero to three.
04:34 - So the total number of elements
might be four, 10, 20, 100.
04:38 - If there's 100 elements,
the index values
04:40 - go from zero to 99.
04:42 - Let's practice that.
04:43 - So I have an array
with 10 things in it--
04:45 - zero, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.
04:48 - If you count from zero,
you end with nine,
04:50 - you've got 10 things total.
04:52 - It seems silly to
keep saying that,
04:53 - but it's something
that you-- it's
04:54 - a mantra you repeat
to yourself to get
04:56 - used to this idea of counting
from zero with an array.
04:59 - So this is this index.
05:00 - Now, let's go and
put this syntax
05:02 - into an actual p5 example and
see what we might do with that.
05:05 - OK.
05:05 - I'm back over here now
and I'm at five minutes.
05:10 - That's good.
05:11 - Let's see how far I can get.
05:12 - So ignore this example.
05:14 - I'm making a new project.
05:16 - I'm going to move it
over here, and I'm
05:20 - going to save it as arrays one.
05:25 - OK.
05:25 - So at the top, I'm going to say
var nums equals 100, 25, 12,
05:33 - 72.
05:34 - So there are four values
in my array up there.
05:37 - And I'm going to make a canvas.
05:40 - That's 400, 400.
05:41 - And just for
comparison's sake, I'm
05:43 - going to add a
regular variable now
05:45 - that has the number 23 in it.
05:48 - And something that I might
do with a regular variable
05:50 - is just say ellipse at
100, 200, and I might
05:56 - use that variable for its size.
06:01 - So you can see here, I now have
this variable with the value
06:04 - 23.
06:05 - That variable is being used
for the width and height
06:07 - of the ellipse, and that
ellipse is drawn there
06:09 - with a width and
height of 23 pixels.
06:11 - So the next job that I
would like to do here
06:13 - is how do I get one of
the numbers from the array
06:16 - and use one of the numbers
from the array in something
06:19 - like the size of an ellipse,
location of the ellipse,
06:21 - the color of the ellipse?
06:23 - How do I pull values
out of an array.
06:24 - So that comes back over
here to the indices--
06:28 - the index values.
06:30 - So if, for example,
this is the array--
06:32 - var nums equals this.
06:35 - If in my code I ever
say nums, then I'm
06:39 - referring to the entire array.
06:41 - But it's not that often that you
refer to the array as a whole.
06:44 - More likely, you'd refer
to the individual elements
06:47 - of the array one at a time.
06:49 - So the way to do that is,
again, with square brackets.
06:53 - So if I say nums
index two, that means
06:56 - I'm referring to this
value, 12, and this
06:59 - evaluates to the number
12, just like num
07:04 - evaluates to the number five.
07:06 - So again, this is a
list of variables.
07:08 - Each one of these you refer to
the array name and its index.
07:12 - OK.
07:12 - Now, back over here,
we can now do that.
07:16 - So I can say let's draw a second
ellipse a little bit over,
07:21 - and let's draw it
at nums index two.
07:26 - Now, which one is index two?
07:29 - It's not the second
one in the list.
07:31 - It's zero, one, two.
07:33 - It's 12.
07:33 - Let's make it a little bigger.
07:35 - Let's make that one 46.
07:37 - That's a nice number.
07:39 - It's an age I will be someday--
07:41 - some day kind of soon.
07:42 - Not that soon, but soon.
07:44 - Whatever.
07:44 - It doesn't matter.
07:45 - OK.
07:46 - So you can see this now I have
a second circle with a width
07:50 - and height of 46
pixels as opposed
07:52 - to the first circle with
a width and height of 23.
07:55 - Wonderful.
07:56 - Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
07:58 - OK.
07:59 - Oh, I forgot a
whole video which is
08:01 - I've got to look at how to
do this with a for loop,
08:04 - but that'll be the next video.
08:05 - So this is one example.
08:07 - And I think I'm going to make
another example right now
08:09 - and then we'll come back to
this one in the next video.
08:11 - So one of the things to
realize here that I think
08:13 - is exciting and
interesting about arrays
08:16 - is that this number
does not have
08:18 - to be the index value that
I'm using into the array.
08:21 - It doesn't have to be
a hard coded value.
08:22 - It could be a dynamic value--
08:24 - something that's picked randomly
or through some algorithm.
08:27 - So let's take a look at that.
08:28 - And I'm going to say to
save this as arrays two,
08:34 - and I'm going to
change this to words.
08:38 - And I'm going to make some words
like rainbow and heart and--
08:47 - what are some other nice words?
08:49 - Purple, I like, and friendship.
08:56 - And this is all I can think of.
09:00 - So I have an array.
09:00 - So first of all, the thing
that I'm emphasizing here
09:03 - is you can put
anything into an array.
09:05 - You can put text into an array,
numbers into array, objects
09:09 - into an array-- that's what
I'm getting at soon enough.
09:11 - So what might I do
with this array?
09:14 - Well, I might say,
all right, fill 255.
09:18 - Use the p5 text function.
09:20 - I want to draw some
text onto the screen.
09:22 - And I'm going to say draw--
09:24 - for example, if I
just say draw rainbow
09:26 - onto the screen at 212--
09:30 - and maybe I make it a little
bit bigger so we see it.
09:33 - 32 pixels the font size.
09:36 - You can see-- oops.
09:37 - I don't know where I put that.
09:39 - 200 pixels over.
09:40 - I meant to put it like 12
pixels over and 200 pixels down
09:44 - because-- there's the
word rainbow appearing
09:46 - in the sketch.
09:47 - Wonderful.
09:48 - Oh, look at this.
09:48 - I made a blue mass there.
09:50 - Oh, magic.
09:53 - So I hard coded rainbow here.
09:57 - Now, I want to pull
something from the array.
09:59 - So what I want to say is ah-ha.
10:01 - What I want is words index zero.
10:05 - I want that first
index into the array.
10:10 - There we go.
10:10 - I have rainbow.
10:11 - Now, if I change this to
two, I see the word purple.
10:17 - So the point that I'm
making is this number
10:19 - could be a variable.
10:20 - What if I say var x equals
zero and put index here?
10:26 - And now what if I say
function mousePressed
10:30 - index equals index plus one?
10:33 - Camera just went off, so
hopefully this one is not
10:35 - going to go off in a second.
10:38 - So what's happening now?
10:39 - The value of index is zero, so
I'm seeing words, index zero,
10:43 - I'm seeing rainbow.
10:44 - But as soon as I click the
mouse, index will become one
10:47 - and I should see heart.
10:49 - And then I should see
purple, and then I
10:51 - should see friendship,
and then I should see--
10:53 - oh, an error message, right?
10:55 - So this is a key thing.
10:56 - No one's going to
save you if you
10:59 - try to access an element into
an array that doesn't exist.
11:02 - If I say words index
27, it doesn't exist.
11:06 - It's null or undefined or
some sort of JavaScript thing
11:09 - that doesn't exist
yet, and you won't
11:11 - be able to draw that onto the
screen and you'll get an error.
11:13 - So it's up to you to
build logic into your code
11:16 - to protect yourself.
11:17 - For example, I could
say, hey, you know what,
11:20 - if index equals four, maybe
I should reset index back
11:24 - to zero.
11:26 - And it's not four, right?
11:28 - Oh, yes it is four, right,
because zero exists,
11:30 - one exists, two exists--
11:32 - zero exists, one
exists, two exists,
11:34 - three exists, but not four.
11:35 - So now if I run that, you'll
see it cycles back to zero
11:40 - every time I get to four.
11:41 - But what if I go up here and
add love into this array?
11:50 - So I don't ever see love because
I stopped myself at four,
11:54 - and now there are actually
five elements in the array.
11:58 - So how do I deal
with that problem?
12:00 - Well, one way to deal
with that problem
12:03 - would be to just change this
number four to the number five.
12:05 - But an interesting thing that
will come up again and again
12:08 - is that arrays also store
properties about themselves.
12:11 - So in addition to
be able to access
12:13 - individual elements
of the array,
12:15 - we can access other information
about the array itself,
12:18 - such as the current
length of the array.
12:20 - So if the length
actually can change
12:22 - as the program's running--
12:24 - for example, what
if we got user input
12:26 - and started filling that array
with words from the user?
12:28 - So one thing I can do here
is actually dynamically check
12:31 - if the index equals the
length of the array, right?
12:34 - Remember, we're going up
by one, so if there's four,
12:37 - the valid indices are
zero, one, two, and three,
12:42 - but the invalid index is four.
12:45 - There are four elements,
but zero through three
12:47 - are the right index values.
12:48 - I have to repeat this to myself
because it hurts a little bit
12:53 - to have this little
minor point of confusion.
12:55 - OK.
12:55 - So let's test this
and see if this works.
12:59 - One, two, three.
13:00 - So what I might suggest to
you is, do this same thing.
13:04 - Make a list of words.
13:06 - What if you have them
picked randomly each time
13:08 - you run the sketch or each
time you click the mouse?
13:11 - Try to use an array of colors.
13:12 - Could you pick a random color
for a bunch of different shapes
13:15 - your drawing on the screen?
13:16 - So what's a kind of
list of information
13:18 - that you might use for an
element that you're drawing,
13:21 - and what's a way
that you might pick
13:23 - from that list-- either
one at a time or randomly
13:25 - or two at a time?
13:26 - Come up with a little
exercise for yourself.
13:28 - And in the next video,
what I will show
13:30 - you is how to march through
every element in the list.
13:33 - How would you display
all of the words?
13:35 - How would you use
all of the values
13:37 - for the size of the ellipse?
13:38 - OK.
13:39 - So this marks the end of this
first video about arrays,
13:41 - and there will be
more like the next one
13:43 - I'll record in just a minute.
13:44 - OK.
