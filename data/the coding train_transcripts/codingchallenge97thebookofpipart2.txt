00:00 - I can't resist I'm gonna do one more
00:03 - coding challenge video first of all I
00:06 - forgot I had this idea of trying to do
00:08 - the different like polygons for each one
00:10 - of these cells I'll leave that as an
00:12 - exercise to the viewer anyway I talked
00:15 - about different things you could do but
00:16 - I just want to see I want to kind of see
00:17 - the numbers so I'm gonna try to do this
00:20 - in a just to see how that works I'm not
00:22 - gonna do I'm gonna keep everything just
00:24 - black and white just the pure text but
00:27 - I'm still gonna draw each character each
00:30 - number one character at a time because
00:32 - that would allow for a lot more
00:34 - possibilities obviously again if I just
00:36 - want to make a book of all the digits
00:37 - open up the text file print export to
00:40 - PDF etc but I'm gonna draw each digit
00:42 - one at a time so let me try to alter
00:44 - this to do that so couple things one is
00:47 - let me do save as and do Pi Day six this
00:51 - is like apparently the sixth thing I
00:53 - made I'm going to go back to book of Pi
00:56 - I'm gonna check one million texts I'm
00:58 - gonna and then I'm gonna load the 1
00:59 - million Pi file and I'm gonna keep it at
01:03 - 100 I should really make oh it timeout
01:06 - let me make a smaller text file and I'll
01:09 - be right back
01:10 - ok I'm back I've made a smaller file
01:12 - with only 1000 digits of pi I think
01:14 - that'll be easier to work with let's
01:16 - make it just 10 by 10 so it'll still be
01:18 - a 10 page PDF I'm gonna get rid of
01:20 - colormode HSB I don't want to deal with
01:22 - that I'm still gonna have this idea of
01:25 - multiple pages I'm still gonna and now
01:27 - I'm not gonna draw rectangles anymore
01:29 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
01:32 - so first of all I need to I need to add
01:35 - a background so I'm gonna make a white
01:37 - back I'm gonna happen make the
01:38 - background white before I start drawing
01:40 - let's go down here and make the
01:42 - background white then I'm going to say
01:45 - here I don't I'm gonna just say fill 0
01:48 - so every piece of text and then I'm
01:51 - going to draw the digit at a certain
01:55 - location I had this from an earlier
01:56 - coding challenge and I think that's it
01:59 - this should give me all the digits so
02:01 - this is weirdly gonna happen pretty fast
02:03 - but as we're gonna see I want me to need
02:06 - to do some clean up clean up here so it
02:07 - did all the pages and if I go to which
02:11 - one of this which book of Pi
02:13 - thousand texts we should see yeah there
02:16 - we go so we could see one for one fight
02:18 - so a couple things one is I would like
02:21 - to include the I'm not gonna worry about
02:23 - the three-point so one thing is I didn't
02:25 - think about the size of the text
02:27 - uh-huh now actually I'm curious here I
02:29 - think what I want to do is try to
02:31 - separate thing I should use a fixed
02:33 - width if I was a file was to get more
02:35 - careful I would just use a fixed width
02:36 - font which was my plan but I'm actually
02:38 - kind of curious here because in theory I
02:42 - could change this for loop to be a while
02:45 - loop and I could say here float x equals
02:50 - zero while X is less than width and then
02:56 - at the end here I could say X plus
02:59 - equals text width of digit I think the
03:05 - text align Center is going to give me a
03:07 - little bit of an issue why is that not
03:10 - Oh not digit text width of that string
03:14 - and actually if I'm drawing the text
03:15 - let's just get rid of the idea of digit
03:17 - entirely so I believe this will actually
03:21 - let's see what happens we what we
03:23 - probably won't get we don't know how
03:24 - many pages we're gonna have so
03:26 - eventually we're just gonna so what I'm
03:29 - gonna do is say if in debt so I'm
03:33 - actually just gonna say break or I'm
03:35 - just gonna say how can I get out of both
03:37 - loops right here
03:37 - I mean I could say break cuz I'm in the
03:45 - wild like if I ever get to the end of
03:47 - what I have then I should get oh but I
03:50 - oh no no no let's use a fixed-width font
03:54 - not the world I feel like the problem is
03:57 - now I don't know when to go to another
03:58 - page I'm have to test the why now that's
04:01 - fine though that's fine no no that's
04:04 - still going to work so gonna go to the
04:05 - next page when I get down so let's let's
04:07 - let's do something let's create a
04:09 - variable boolean finish this is an
04:11 - awkward way of doing it but I know it
04:12 - will work equal false and so here what I
04:16 - want to do is I want to say finished if
04:19 - I ever get to the end finish just true
04:21 - and then I think I could sort of say
04:27 - if finished right
04:30 - we'll continue get me out of a return I
04:35 - could return no because I could return
04:37 - but I need to I need to get to this exit
04:40 - and since I'm just in setup
04:42 - yeah return would be good so one I call
04:45 - this void render book this is work this
04:50 - is gonna be worth it I'm gonna say
04:53 - render book all that the loading stuff
04:56 - and this has to be a global variable now
05:00 - the loading stuff will happen in setups
05:02 - till then I'm going to take all of this
05:04 - and put it in render book exit'
05:10 - footprint lines finish and exit will not
05:12 - will be here then I'm gonna say render
05:14 - book and all I have to do is not have
05:19 - any of this finished nonsense and just
05:20 - say return and I don't need all this
05:22 - if finished stuff anymore the total
05:26 - pages is kind of wrong like I don't but
05:29 - I but I think it's fine like this will
05:30 - give me I think it's okay like I just
05:34 - need to actually I think this could be
05:35 - like a while true basically I can just
05:37 - keep doing new pages but let's just
05:38 - leave it for right now
05:40 - so I think what's going to an exit but I
05:43 - have like the wrong amount of brackets
05:44 - so render book do the double loop oh
05:50 - this and oh oh oh yeah this is a while
05:53 - loop right and I'm at the end of each of
05:57 - going based on the text with then index
06:00 - is going up if I get to the end I'm done
06:02 - otherwise I am not finished to page oh
06:07 - there's a missing this is a missing
06:09 - curly bracket right because the page is
06:12 - done at the end of the this is the X
06:18 - loop this is the Y loop so if I
06:21 - highlight this it should that's the X
06:24 - this is the Y that's the end of a page
06:27 - okay so let's see what happens here oh
06:29 - and now I need to call oh this should
06:32 - this and this should be here
06:33 - this can be here and set up and then I
06:35 - want to say let me just run this ok
06:38 - nothing now I'm going to call read
06:40 - under book so hopefully they don't it'll
06:43 - just go until it runs out of numbers
06:47 - finished how come I didn't see how come
06:52 - I didn't see multiple pages hmm well
06:58 - let's see what I got did I get anything
06:59 - in the PDF oh oh because it fit in one
07:03 - page I fit in one page okay so it fits
07:07 - in one page because the numbers are all
07:09 - just right next to each other okay easy
07:11 - easy alright so now let's think about
07:13 - how I'm calculating the width and height
07:16 - so the number of columns in wrote there
07:19 - the idea of columns is no longer
07:21 - relevant right and the idea of rows is
07:25 - honestly no longer really because what I
07:27 - have is I want a font size so I want a
07:30 - font size which would be the default
07:33 - font size is 12 but let's just set that
07:37 - so I'm gonna set right here I'm gonna
07:39 - say text size 12 and so I'm told
07:46 - somebody the chat said this to be
07:48 - earlier that 120% of a text size is the
07:53 - proper like line spacing so if it's
07:56 - 12-point text 12 times 1.2 this would be
08:00 - about fourteen point four and sort of
08:02 - the line height so in theory I should be
08:07 - able to have H be so the width should be
08:10 - twelve the height should be fourteen
08:12 - point four maybe just round it to
08:14 - fourteen but I'll leave it as fourteen
08:16 - point four and then I know this total
08:21 - pages thing is nonsense now because I
08:23 - can basically just say I could just say
08:25 - while true like keep doing more pages
08:29 - until you're done so let's see if this
08:33 - makes sense let's see what happens here
08:37 - look oh but I do want to count the
08:40 - number of pages so I'm gonna say into
08:42 - page num equals zero and I'm going to
08:45 - say page num plus plus and it's gonna
08:48 - tell me when a page is completed okay
08:53 - Paige Paige none okay let's run this
08:58 - finished oh because it again does only
09:01 - need one page this is looking pretty
09:05 - good there's all my digits let's add the
09:08 - three point three point one there right
09:12 - oh it's kind of cut off at the end there
09:14 - so let me be let me make sure it doesn't
09:16 - get cut off at the end so Y if X is less
09:21 - than Oh with minus W with Mike because I
09:25 - want to I want to cut it off before it
09:26 - could say maybe W divided by two but
09:29 - let's yeah W divided by 2 would be okay
09:31 - so let's do that that should fix that
09:35 - finished and now I have a new right that
09:39 - fixed that over on this side okay and by
09:42 - the way why not make this more like it
09:43 - eight and a half by eleven piece of
09:45 - paper so let's have that be 850 1150
09:49 - okay book of Pi let's go for 1 million
09:54 - and let's do PI 1 million book of PI
09:59 - million - text ok you ready for this I
10:03 - don't know if it's gonna work to go on
10:05 - to a new page but
10:11 - doing some pages how many pages is it
10:14 - gonna be to have all 1 million digits
10:16 - I'll be back ok it completed at page 111
10:24 - so now we should have this is the most
10:28 - insane way anybody has ever converted a
10:31 - text file to a PDF but there's a lot of
10:34 - wonder wonderful stuff what I'm doing
10:35 - here so let's look at this book a pie 1
10:37 - million texts and we can see here oh why
10:40 - didn't I get that oh I have to do this
10:41 - again it's bothered me that it doesn't
10:43 - say 3.1 there but we can see here look
10:45 - here's my book of Pi I fries some
10:47 - margins should probably some margins but
10:50 - here it is it's a hundred eleven pages
10:52 - of all and let's see how big this file
10:55 - is it's a 112 megabyte file which
10:59 - probably doesn't need to be cuz it's
11:01 - just a hundred pages of text but
11:03 - probably in the way that it's rendering
11:04 - it is a little bit crazy so okay let's
11:07 - let's just do one more thing let's go
11:11 - for 10 million and let's add three point
11:17 - there so we're gonna add the three dot
11:20 - and we're gonna render 10 million all
11:23 - right I'll see you
11:25 - if one about a thousand pages we should
11:28 - be about a thousand pages okay here we
11:31 - go I'll see you in a bit
11:33 - alright I'm actually stopping rendering
11:36 - that dead file that was gonna have 10
11:38 - million digits in it because I've
11:39 - noticed that they the spacing between
11:41 - the numbers the kerning is off and
11:43 - actually I've done this before we're
11:44 - moving by text with works perfectly with
11:48 - with doesn't work perfectly but I I
11:50 - don't have an issue with it but
11:52 - apparently the way this font is
11:53 - organized these the numbers are all that
11:56 - elbow all defined with the same width so
11:58 - I'm I kind of have done something wrong
11:59 - here I'm gonna switch to using amount of
12:01 - spaced font why not
12:03 - so I'm gonna add to the code I'm gonna
12:07 - just say right here under render book
12:09 - I'm going to say text I'm gonna say a P
12:12 - font F equals create font I'll just use
12:14 - courier I could use courier new but I
12:17 - think I'll just use courier and give it
12:20 - a size of 12 and then I'm gonna say text
12:24 - font F let me switch back to the 1000
12:31 - 1000 file just to test this let me run
12:35 - this it finished right one page let me
12:40 - look at this now 1000 whoops no wrong
12:45 - 110 million text whoops it could not
12:48 - open because it was empty what did I do
12:50 - wrong
12:50 - I messed something up oh I forgot exit
12:55 - exit needs to be in there okay let's try
12:57 - it again finished let's open that up and
13:03 - there now we can all breathe whoops a
13:06 - sigh of relief all these numbers are
13:11 - nicely spaced from each other perfectly
13:14 - in mono spaced
13:16 - lined up exactly in organized fashion
13:18 - actually this is kind of nice because
13:19 - maybe we'll find some interesting
13:21 - patterns almost like a some sort of word
13:23 - search number search puzzle let's look
13:25 - at the it looks like we're oh I took out
13:30 - in my investigation of this I took out
13:33 - the text-align:center so let me put that
13:37 - back in run this one more time it's now
13:43 - finished let me come back over here whoa
13:46 - oh right I messed up some stuff I'd say
13:49 - with minus 2x plus with divided by 2 I
13:52 - took out some stuff I while I was
13:54 - fussing around with trying to figure out
13:55 - the spacing finished and now there we go
13:58 - so I should add some margins let's add
14:00 - some margins let's say we're gonna start
14:04 - with X at 100 and Y at 100 we're gonna
14:09 - go to width minus 100 minus W 2 and
14:14 - width and height minus 100 so okay so
14:19 - let's make this let's make this a
14:21 - variable int margin equals 100 margin
14:25 - margin margin margin and let's see what
14:31 - that does
14:34 - and finished
14:36 - and that's fine it looks like about an
14:39 - inch
14:40 - whatever so now we have our book of Pi
14:42 - now here we go it is time I'm gonna go
14:46 - back we're gonna make this book have ten
14:48 - million digits and I want to emphasize
14:53 - that the way that I program this you
14:55 - could render each number individually as
14:59 - anything you want because they're all
15:00 - rendered one at a time in processing
15:02 - with any drawing capabilities that you
15:04 - could imagine okay let's go back and say
15:08 - PI 10 million okay I'm really gonna run
15:11 - this and I'm really gonna be back when
15:14 - it finishes see in a minute
15:16 - go let's just make sure it's going okay
15:19 - I think I'm assuming it's gonna be like
15:22 - well over a thousand pages see ya in a
15:24 - bit we have now finished at 1761 pages I
15:32 - have made a book just for reference this
15:35 - book is 200 pages
15:39 - this book is 200 pages I have now made a
15:43 - book that does seven 1700 I mean 600
15:46 - pages 661 pages which in theory has 10
15:50 - million digits of pi and plus the 3.1 so
15:54 - it actually has 10 million in two
15:55 - characters now let's go to my folder it
16:01 - is a two gigabyte file
16:04 - let's try Acrobat Reader agree yeah I
16:09 - agree
16:11 - take my book of Pi this looks good here
16:17 - it is this is the book of Pi it is two
16:23 - gave us now the absurd thing is once
16:25 - again is I could have just taken that
16:27 - text file and done to print to PDF but
16:30 - if you wanted to you could render this
16:33 - and you could have I don't want to look
16:35 - close I don't want to see any mistakes
16:37 - you could I don't have the page numbers
16:40 - on it I should probably use CSS page
16:42 - media and the whole other way and expand
16:44 - tags oh I'll come back another time
16:48 - do it a different way so but again I
16:50 - could have done the same exact thing but
16:52 - had these to be little blocks of color
16:53 - or anything so I will just do to finish
16:56 - off this video oh I made it go upside
16:59 - down I will read to you from page what
17:05 - page am I on I will reach you some why
17:09 - is this facing off Oh cuz I have the
17:14 - center thing again I text the line
17:15 - center I need to text the line left I
17:17 - can't do it again oh I forgot to add
17:20 - page numbers chrome can open PDFs that's
17:23 - it I'm sorry that the spacing is off it
17:26 - really bothers me but we'll just have to
17:29 - go on I will read you a little bit of it
17:32 - and this video will fade away six eight
17:37 - eight five one one four five zero six
17:41 - four nine one three one five one eight
17:44 - six one five then there's some other
17:49 - digits for three in the mouse is really
17:52 - in an awkward place zero three one three
17:55 - one nine zero five six
