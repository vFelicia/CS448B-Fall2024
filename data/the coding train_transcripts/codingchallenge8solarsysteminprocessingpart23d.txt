00:00 - Welcome to part 2 of my Solar
System Simulation Generator
00:05 - thing a mabob.
00:05 - So this has turned into
a multipart series.
00:07 - I'm probably going to
do one or two more.
00:09 - But this part, what
I'm going to do,
00:10 - is take this 2D solar
system orbiting thing
00:14 - and turn it into 3D.
00:16 - So instead of circles,
we're going to have spheres.
00:18 - Instead of rotating just around
in a two dimensional plane,
00:22 - we're going to rotate in
a three dimensional space.
00:24 - So now, before I
get to that, I want
00:27 - to make a couple of
small improvements here.
00:29 - I think it could be a little
bit more thoughtful about how
00:31 - I pick the sizes of
the planets and how
00:34 - I pick how far they are from
the thing they're orbiting.
00:36 - So let me dive into
the code real quick
00:38 - before I make this 3D
version, and just go down
00:41 - to where that happens.
00:42 - That happens here.
00:43 - Every time I make
a new planet, it
00:45 - gets a radius that's
based on the previous one.
00:48 - They're shrinking, they're,
shrinking they're shrinking.
00:50 - And it also gets a distance
from the previous one
00:52 - which is some random number.
00:53 - And this is what I
could really improve.
00:55 - So one thing that I want to
do is say, OK the distance--
01:00 - if I wanted it to be perfect--
01:03 - I lost my-- Oh, here it is.
01:05 - Let me go over here.
01:06 - Sorry for the-- OK, so
if I have this planet,
01:09 - and I have this
thing orbiting it,
01:11 - if they were exactly
touching each other,
01:14 - then their distance
would be the two radii--
01:17 - the sum of the two radii.
01:18 - So the first thing I could
do is just show you that.
01:21 - And I'm going to change
this to radius plus r.
01:24 - So let me run this.
01:25 - Now we should see now--
01:30 - do you see how the
first one worked?
01:31 - I don't know what happened
with the second one.
01:33 - Let's think about this.
01:35 - What did I miss here?
01:37 - Oh, the distance.
01:39 - I'm dividing by level.
01:41 - So I should actually
just say that.
01:43 - And now you can see that they're
in a sort of precise location.
01:47 - Every single circle is
rotating around the edge
01:50 - of the other one.
01:51 - It's kind of a nice effect.
01:52 - I almost want to
keep it this way.
01:53 - And by the way, you get some
really interesting patterns
01:55 - if you drew like, trails
where the circles are going.
01:58 - You try that on your own.
01:59 - Just send it to me.
02:00 - But I'm not going to
go down that road.
02:01 - But what I'll do
is I'll just say
02:03 - why not make distance be
random between that exact spot
02:08 - and that distance and
that amount times 2?
02:14 - So in other words,
I'm saying let's make
02:19 - a random in between where
this would be exactly
02:21 - and then this exact
amount times 2.
02:24 - So over here.
02:25 - So the planets will
orbit somewhere
02:27 - between being exactly
touching the original planet,
02:30 - the orbiting the thing
and a little further away.
02:33 - OK, so here we go.
02:36 - OK.
02:37 - So now we can see--
02:38 - I don't know.
02:38 - I just kind of how
this looks better.
02:40 - Everything has kind of a
more thoughtful spacing.
02:43 - And I don't know if the
ratio of the sizes is good,
02:45 - but we'll get worry
about that stuff later.
02:47 - Because what I really want
to focus on is moving to 3D.
02:51 - OK.
02:51 - Exciting.
02:53 - Now is the time, 3
minutes into this video,
02:55 - we're going to add 3D.
02:56 - So first thing I'm
going to do to add 3D--
02:59 - this is going to be
a magical thing--
03:00 - is I'm just going to go here and
I'm going to say 600, 600, P3D.
03:06 - Duh, duh, duh, duh.
03:08 - 3D solar system.
03:09 - There you go.
03:10 - So this is actually
now rendering
03:12 - in 3D using processing
3 D renderer.
03:15 - But of course, I'm still
just drawing circles,
03:17 - and I'm still just placing
everything along that two
03:19 - dimensional plane.
03:20 - But it is important to
note that processing--
03:23 - one of the reasons I
like to use processing
03:25 - is that it lets
you sort of blend
03:27 - and blur the lines
between 2D and 3D.
03:29 - It gives you all the
2D drawing stuff in 3D.
03:31 - But let's look a little
more carefully at this
03:34 - and start going--
03:37 - making this even more 3D.
03:38 - So first thing I
could do to make
03:40 - this more 3D is instead
of drawing an ellipse,
03:43 - I could draw a sphere.
03:45 - So the function to draw
a sphere in processing
03:47 - is just the word sphere.
03:50 - And then sphere takes
a diameter or radius?
03:54 - I'm not really sure.
03:55 - Let's try radius.
03:57 - So in an ellipse, notice
how I said radius times 2,
04:00 - because I know for a fact
the ellipse function requires
04:04 - a full diameter as the argument.
04:06 - But I think sphere
may be just once a--
04:12 - Does this look right to you?
04:13 - Now first of all, it's sort of
hard to see what's going on.
04:15 - So first of all, you see
what a sphere actually is.
04:18 - Everything in 3D
is made up of all
04:19 - of these kind of like
polygons and shapes.
04:21 - And you can see
it's just this mesh
04:23 - of all these kind of
rectangles with a line divided.
04:26 - But it's really like
a triangle mesh.
04:28 - But we don't want
to see all that.
04:30 - What we want to just see--
04:31 - And so one thing that I'll do
is here in where I'm drawing it,
04:35 - I want to say no stroke.
04:38 - And I'm going to
just say fill 255.
04:40 - And I'm going to do this again.
04:42 - And now look at that.
04:45 - Nothing about this looks
3D because I'm just
04:48 - staring straight at
these spheres that
04:50 - are pure white without a
texture without some shadowing
04:55 - and lighting.
04:56 - I don't really even
see that 3D effect.
04:58 - So one thing I could do just
to kind of see the 3D effect
05:02 - is just add the very
generic function lights.
05:05 - So lighting in 3D is an
interesting and complex topic.
05:10 - And you can have spotlights and
directional lights and ambient
05:12 - lights and different colored
lights and all sorts of things.
05:15 - I'm going to stay
away from that.
05:16 - Maybe someday I'll have the
courage to a video about that.
05:19 - But lights-- the simple lights
function just generically
05:22 - adds kind of a wash of
light into the scene.
05:24 - And you'll see what
that's going to do.
05:26 - So now we can see that now this
has the appearance-- they have
05:29 - the appearance more of spheres.
05:31 - It's very subtle,
but there's some
05:32 - shadowing on the spheres
based on the lights.
05:34 - Now this is almost
like, hey, we're done.
05:38 - I made this simulation in 3D.
05:40 - Look!
05:41 - And in a way it
looks kind of 3D.
05:42 - And I could add some camera
work and do some other things.
05:45 - But everything is actually
happening all on one plane.
05:49 - And what I want to do--
05:50 - and I'm going to try to
draw a diagram here just
05:53 - to kind of work this
out in my head--
05:55 - is let's say I have a sphere.
05:59 - What I want to do is
arbitrarily-- now again,
06:02 - I'm not doing anything
that has anything
06:04 - to do necessarily with how
the actual universe works.
06:06 - I'm just trying to
create something
06:08 - that looks kind of
interesting and figure out
06:10 - how stuff works in processing.
06:11 - But I want to arbitrarily
create a vector out
06:15 - from a particular planet,
and create another planet,
06:18 - and then maybe rotate
around the planet.
06:21 - So there would be all
of this would happen--
06:23 - I'm drawing in two
dimensional space.
06:24 - So it's very hard to do, and
I have no artistic talent
06:26 - whatsoever.
06:27 - So I can't even
really draw this well.
06:28 - But you can sort
of imagine I want
06:30 - to arbitrarily place a
planet out here and have
06:32 - it rotate like this,
or one out here
06:34 - and have it rotate like this.
06:35 - So the idea is
that I want to make
06:36 - a vector-- a random vector.
06:38 - So let's do that.
06:41 - And I'm going to go
into the planet object.
06:45 - And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to add a variable.
06:51 - I'm going to call it v, just
for lack of anything else
06:55 - that I can think of right now.
06:56 - I'm going to say v equals
p vector dot random 3D.
07:01 - So this here is a particular--
07:04 - Oh boy.
07:04 - I'm not in the right place.
07:05 - Sorry, everybody.
07:07 - That was a little
awkward moment there.
07:08 - But I don't know.
07:10 - Maybe some like CGI magic
can fix that someday.
07:15 - So what I created here
is a random 3D vector.
07:20 - So any vector pointing in
space that is of length 1.
07:25 - And so then what I want to
do is multiply that vector
07:32 - by distance.
07:33 - So in other words, I want
to scale it by the distance
07:36 - that it should be.
07:37 - So again, if only I had like,
good spherical things here.
07:42 - My fist will be a planet.
07:44 - Then I make a unit vector
of length 1 pointing out.
07:48 - And then I want to scale
it by some distance
07:50 - that it should be.
07:51 - And now I have another
planet out here.
07:53 - Visual aid.
07:54 - Boy, this is quite pathetic.
07:55 - I need props.
07:56 - Somebody send me some props.
07:58 - So then when I'm drawing
it, let's look down here.
08:03 - I don't want to translate
simply along the x-axis
08:06 - by some distance
like I did in 2D.
08:09 - I want to translate by
that vector v.xv.y v.z.
08:13 - And what I'm going
to do here is I'm
08:15 - going to take out rotation for
right now, and just translate.
08:19 - And we can see
what's going on here.
08:21 - And you can see that there
are a bunch of spheres.
08:24 - And let me fix a few--
08:25 - You know what?
08:28 - I'm going to keep going.
08:29 - So let me fix a few things
to make this sort of easier
08:32 - to figure out.
08:32 - Number one is if you
recall, the planets
08:36 - are picking a random
number of moons.
08:40 - So I want to just
change that to one.
08:42 - So every planet
just has one moon.
08:44 - And I'm also going
to have fewer levels.
08:47 - So we can see now
that when I run this--
08:50 - whoops.
08:56 - What happened here?
09:01 - Time out!
09:02 - Time out!
09:05 - Oops.
09:06 - So I forgot that in
the original sun,
09:10 - the original planet has
five moons around it.
09:12 - So I just want to have
that start with one also.
09:14 - And we can see now that
we have something simpler
09:17 - to look at, which is just
one sun in the middle,
09:21 - one moon around that,
and one moon around that.
09:24 - OK.
09:25 - I'm realizing something.
09:26 - I'm realizing that this
would be a lot easier
09:28 - to look at and understand if I
could just really quickly like
09:32 - drag the mouse around and
like, spin the planets
09:34 - and turn the camera.
09:35 - So even though I intended to
do this in a separate video,
09:39 - right in this video
right now, I'm
09:40 - going to add something called
PeasyCam to this example.
09:45 - So how do you add PeasyCam?
09:46 - PeasyCam is a library.
09:48 - And I'm going to do Sketch,
Import Library, Add Library.
09:52 - Oh!
09:52 - PeasyCam is already added.
09:55 - So I've already done that.
09:56 - I don't know when I did that.
09:57 - But by the way, what
you'll need to do is here,
10:00 - go to Add Library, search
for PeasyCam, click this,
10:05 - and then you'll be able to click
Install so that it's installed.
10:10 - And then you shouldn't
need to restart processing.
10:12 - But if you run into any issues,
just restart processing.
10:14 - So once you have
PeasyCam installed,
10:17 - I can do Sketch, Import Library,
and just select here PeasyCam.
10:22 - And you can see it added some
import statements to the top.
10:26 - A library being
something that allows
10:28 - you to bring in
additional code that's
10:30 - not part of core processing
to call automatic functions.
10:33 - And what PeasyCam does
is it automatically
10:35 - adds interactive mouse camera
work to your three thing.
10:39 - So then all I need to do
is create a PeasyCam--
10:44 - or maybe it's just
a PeasyObject?
10:46 - No, PeasyCamObject?
10:48 - No.
10:50 - What is it called?
10:51 - Oh, PeasyCam?
10:52 - There we go.
10:53 - PeasyCamObject called Cam.
10:55 - And I'm going to say
Cam equals new PeasyCam.
11:00 - And I think I have to say
this to refer to this sketch,
11:03 - because it's going to control
this sketch's 3D view.
11:06 - And then I give it like, some
number which is basically I
11:11 - want the camera automatically to
look at the center of the world
11:14 - 000 from 100 units away.
11:18 - So by the way, if
I wanted to look
11:20 - at a different
part of the world,
11:22 - I could say I want
to look at 0, 100, 0.
11:25 - I could add that in as well.
11:26 - But I'm just going to
say this comma 100,
11:29 - and I'm going to run it.
11:32 - And now you should see
now, where is everything?
11:34 - Oh, it's all weird.
11:35 - So why am I not able
to find the stuff
11:38 - and kind of rotate it around
it in a way that makes sense?
11:40 - The reason is because I had
this extra translate in there,
11:44 - width divided by 2
height divided by 2,
11:46 - so that was my kind of like
camera work to just like
11:49 - move the origin to the
center of the window.
11:51 - Now that I'm using PeasyCam,
I don't need this anymore.
11:54 - I can run this and we
can see, oh my goodness.
11:57 - Look at that.
11:58 - There it is.
11:59 - I'm just like, 100 pixels away.
12:01 - And I think if I hit like,
Command I can Pan or Control,
12:05 - I can zoom in and out.
12:06 - But this is what I want to see.
12:07 - I want to see something
like this really easily.
12:10 - And so what I'm going to do
is just start 500 units away,
12:13 - start further away.
12:15 - So now we can see
this is what I've got.
12:17 - And you can see
now the shadowing.
12:18 - You can see there's
each one of these
12:21 - has a-- this planet has one moon
and that planet has one moon.
12:27 - Let's even remove this and just
start now with a single moon.
12:31 - So we can see here I have
the sun and a single moon.
12:34 - How can I get that moon
to rotate around the sun?
12:39 - OK, here's how we're
going to do it.
12:41 - Now I'm sure there's some really
excellent 3D thoughtful, smart
12:46 - way of doing it.
12:46 - I'm going to do it in a sort of
tricky way that I know works,
12:51 - or that I hope works.
12:52 - And I'm going to use something
called across product.
12:54 - OK, so let me come
over here, and let's
12:57 - talk about the cross product.
13:01 - The cross product is--
13:04 - let's say I have two vectors.
13:05 - Here is a vector.
13:06 - Here is another vector.
13:08 - The cross product
of two vectors is
13:11 - this a vector that is
perpendicular to both
13:15 - of those vectors.
13:17 - So if these were my vectors,
I would still also get
13:21 - this particular vector.
13:22 - So the reason why I want
to do that is remember,
13:25 - this is the sun, this is
the vector where my moon is.
13:31 - And what I want essentially
is for that vector
13:34 - to rotate around
the sun like this.
13:37 - So what I need essentially is
a vector that's perpendicular.
13:40 - Like, I want it to rotate
around this axis like this.
13:44 - So in other words,
let me try to do this
13:47 - in three dimensional space.
13:49 - I don't know.
13:50 - Props.
13:51 - I have some tissues.
13:52 - They'll be my planets.
13:54 - Here's the sun.
13:55 - I'm going to go--
13:57 - I'm a vector.
13:58 - The moon comes out.
14:00 - And then I have--
14:01 - my fist is the sun.
14:02 - I have this perpendicular
vector I want to rotate--
14:07 - I've totally lost myself.
14:09 - I want to-- I think if you would
just imagine or think about
14:11 - what I'm doing, it makes
sense because I need--
14:14 - I can't rotate-- if I
rotate around this axis,
14:17 - this is just going to spin.
14:19 - This is the vector.
14:21 - If I rotate around that axis,
it's just going to spin,
14:23 - like this.
14:23 - I want that whole
vector to rotate.
14:25 - So I need a perpendicular
vector to rotate around.
14:28 - If this makes any sense
to anybody, then I'm--
14:32 - I'll be surprised
and very pleased--
14:35 - should practice explaining that.
14:36 - So how do I get a
perpendicular vector?
14:40 - So right here, what I want
to do is make another vector.
14:46 - I'm going to call it
p for perpendicular.
14:49 - I'm going to make a p vector v.
And I want to say v dot cross.
14:54 - So to get a
perpendicular vector,
14:56 - I want to take the cross
product with something.
14:58 - Well, what should I take
the cross product with?
15:00 - Honestly, I could be smart
about how I'm doing this.
15:04 - But if I just pick
some arbitrary--
15:07 - there's a lot of--
15:08 - in three-dimensional
space, there's
15:09 - a lot of vectors that are
perpendicular to this vector.
15:11 - This one's perpendicular.
15:12 - This one's perpendicular.
15:13 - This one's perpendicular.
15:14 - This one's perpendicular.
15:15 - Any of these vectors
are perpendicular.
15:18 - So I just want to
get an arbitrary one.
15:20 - So if I have some other
vector, I'll get something--
15:22 - and I do the cross product,
I'll get a perpendicular one.
15:24 - So what I'll do is just
say v2 equals new PVector.
15:30 - And I'm going to just
arbitrarily pick a vector that
15:33 - points straight out.
15:34 - And you know what?
15:34 - Maybe I'll actually just
pick something arbitrary.
15:37 - And I'm going to make p
the cross product of v,
15:42 - the vector that is actually
coming out from this planet
15:44 - to where--
15:45 - out from the sun to where
this planet should be.
15:47 - And now I've got some
perpendicular vector.
15:50 - And now I can use
something here.
15:53 - I can use processing's
rotate function.
15:55 - In 3D, you can say an arbitrary
axis I want to rotate around.
16:00 - So if this is the x-axis,
rotating around the x-axis
16:03 - would be like this.
16:04 - If this is the y-axis,
rotating around the y-axis
16:07 - would be like this.
16:08 - Z-- rotating around the
z-axis would be like this.
16:11 - So the functions "rotate x"
rotates around this axis.
16:14 - "Rotate y" rotates
around this axis.
16:16 - "Rotate z" rotates
around this axis.
16:19 - But if you want to
rotate around this axis,
16:21 - you just need to give it the
vector and then the angle.
16:23 - And what's the vector I want?
16:25 - The one that's perpendicular
to the planet sticking out.
16:27 - So I'm going to say rotate
p dot x, p dot y, p dot z.
16:35 - So rotate around the vector from
the x, y, and z by an angle.
16:40 - And let's run this
now and hope we
16:42 - get something that looks right.
16:46 - Am I not increasing the angle?
16:49 - I don't think-- oh, no.
16:50 - The angle is increasing.
16:51 - What did I miss?
16:52 - [LAUGHING]
16:53 - Time-out, everybody.
16:54 - Let me look.
16:55 - Let's look.
16:55 - Is angle first?
17:02 - There we go.
17:03 - So the angle is
the first argument.
17:05 - So look at this.
17:06 - Now I have this planet perfectly
orbiting this other one--
17:10 - so lovely.
17:11 - Now, let me just--
17:12 - to be clear, let me
draw these two vectors
17:15 - so you can see what's
going on because I
17:17 - think this will make things
make a little bit more sense.
17:19 - So let me draw a line from
0, 0, 0, v, x, v, y, v, z.
17:29 - Let me draw that.
17:32 - And do I-- I guess I need
to give it a stroke here.
17:35 - And I should say
noStroke down here.
17:39 - And let me just get the stuff
where it should be going.
17:46 - Can you see it?
17:47 - It's very hard to
see it in there
17:48 - because it's not-- the
planet's not very far out.
17:51 - So let me draw it
longer so you can see it
17:58 - and multiply that vector by 10.
18:01 - There.
18:01 - You can see that is the
vector that is controlling
18:05 - where that planet is.
18:06 - Now, let's draw the other
one, the perpendicular one.
18:12 - This is the axis around
which I'm rotating.
18:16 - And now you can see that's
the axis around which it's
18:20 - rotating.
18:21 - It's a vector that's
perpendicular to that one.
18:23 - So this is just a
quick and dirty way
18:26 - to get a sphere arbitrarily
rotating around another sphere
18:30 - at some arbitrary
axis that's random.
18:32 - So again, you might have some
other algorithm by which you
18:35 - want to calculate this stuff.
18:37 - The cross product that I picked
is just some arbitrary vector.
18:40 - I probably could be more
thoughtful about that.
18:43 - But this works.
18:44 - So now we can start
doing a couple of things.
18:48 - One is let's make sure this
is really working by adding--
18:52 - [VOCALIZING]
18:53 - --where do we pick--
let's add another level.
18:58 - And you can see
now, in addition,
19:01 - this one now has this--
this other smaller one
19:05 - is rotating around that one.
19:06 - And you see all of the
perpendicular vectors.
19:08 - Maybe what I'll do right now is
get rid of this times 10 thing.
19:14 - And you might still be able
to, hopefully, see everything.
19:21 - You can see these vectors here.
19:25 - And maybe let's get rid of--
19:27 - I'm lost in my own-- but this
has become fascinating to me.
19:30 - And I forgot that I'm recording
a video, talking to anybody.
19:33 - And I'm like, oh,
let me try this.
19:34 - But it's useful, I think, to see
the lines drawing the vectors.
19:39 - But the point of this,
really, is to do what?
19:43 - Is to not have these lines
and to just see these planets
19:46 - arbitrarily orbiting each other.
19:48 - So now you can see-- here we go.
19:50 - And I can-- whoops.
19:52 - I can zoom in and out
to get a closer look.
19:55 - And now I'm going to
do the exciting moment.
19:57 - How long have I
been recording this?
19:59 - Maybe 20 minutes or so.
20:00 - I'm going to do the
exciting moment where--
20:02 - the whole point
of doing this was
20:04 - to allow each planet to
have a bunch of things.
20:06 - So for example,
what if I give it--
20:09 - the first sun to have
two moons orbiting it?
20:11 - You can see now
we've got something
20:13 - a little more interesting here.
20:15 - And you can see that
the rotations are--
20:17 - could be weird enough
that you could start to--
20:19 - it almost looks-- the
speeds could be very slow.
20:23 - The way one is
rotating around another
20:24 - while the other one
is rotating could
20:26 - make it have this optical
illusion of not rotating.
20:29 - But I can assure you that
if we-- that everything
20:31 - is rotating around
everything else.
20:33 - And then I can also--
20:34 - let's give it a 4 to start with.
20:37 - And then let's also
allow them, when we--
20:41 - when they create their
moons, to do what?
20:44 - To have a random number
between 0-- let's
20:47 - not give them too many-- and 2.
20:50 - So we can see now-- look
what we've got here.
20:52 - We've got a nice system of many
planets orbiting other planets.
20:56 - Everything's spaced out.
20:59 - And everything's at random
angles along random axes.
21:02 - So hopefully, this
gives you the idea
21:04 - of how to get
started with creating
21:07 - a three-dimensional nested
solar system where you have
21:10 - a sphere with spheres rotating
around it with other spheres
21:13 - rotating around it
and with other spheres
21:15 - rotating around it.
21:16 - And this code you
can find-- if you
21:17 - look in the description
of this video,
21:19 - you'll find the code for this.
21:20 - And what I'm going
to do in part 3
21:21 - is I'm going to add
textures to these planets.
21:24 - So I'm going to
show you how you can
21:25 - draw the spheres
with other textures
21:27 - and maybe put a background
or something else like that
21:30 - to make it feel more spacey.
21:33 - Thanks for watching.
