00:00 - Gordon okay so I've got another topic
00:04 - here about HTML CSS and JavaScript that
00:09 - I'm excited to talk about and I think
00:10 - this same diagram in a way applies but
00:16 - it applies in a different way I totally
00:18 - forgot to like prepare an example let's
00:20 - do one together so over here I'm gonna
00:22 - actually just gonna make a totally new
00:25 - project and I'm gonna save this I'm
00:28 - gonna call it parent-child and I am a
00:33 - child and I'm also a parent that has
00:36 - nothing to do with this video but it
00:37 - just popped into my head
00:38 - my children are very entertaining I do
00:41 - not they are not Dom elements it would
00:43 - be weird to have Dom element children
00:45 - perhaps in the future we will all have
00:48 - strange robotic Dom element children
00:50 - that is not now okay I was saying
00:52 - something so let's let me let me add a
00:57 - parent and child I am a parent and a
01:05 - child so I'm making a web page here that
01:09 - has a header on it and a paragraph and
01:12 - now I am going to do something I am
01:15 - going to say create canvas 400 400 and
01:19 - here I'm going to say background 0 and
01:22 - ellipse you know 200 200 random 100
01:30 - random 100 I don't know what I'm making
01:34 - here but it's the greatest sketch I have
01:36 - ever made and here it is so look here is
01:42 - a page I made to elements in the HTML
01:45 - file a header and a paragraph and then I
01:48 - made this canvas in p5 that's animating
01:51 - and what I really want desperately is I
01:55 - want the canvas to be in between those
01:57 - two things now this is not a
01:58 - particularly interesting problem but it
02:01 - is the essence of a problem and not
02:05 - really a problem but a
02:06 - a thing that will happen to you in your
02:08 - life where you have this elaborate
02:10 - layout that you've figured out in HTML
02:13 - and CSS and you want to insert Dom
02:15 - elements that you're making in
02:16 - JavaScript into the elements I feel I'm
02:19 - a little getting a little tired so like
02:21 - doing a little bit of dancing I think
02:22 - helps you want to insert those elements
02:24 - into the page in a particular spot or
02:27 - and I've got actually a really great
02:29 - I've got another another example in mine
02:33 - which I think I will do in this video
02:34 - that I think will work well as well but
02:36 - let's just start with just this
02:37 - particular problem so if I come back to
02:39 - here this is where what I'm saying like
02:42 - you're calling create canvas in p5 and
02:47 - it makes this canvas element which as it
02:50 - gets attached to the page it's always
02:53 - appended to the HTML body which means it
02:55 - appears at the end of all the things
02:57 - that might already be there but what if
02:59 - you want to put it in here so let the
03:02 - way that this one a way of solving this
03:04 - particular problem is by first reminding
03:07 - yourself about how an HTML page is
03:10 - structured if you recall you can think
03:13 - of an HTML page as this tree the root of
03:17 - the tree is the HTML element a child of
03:21 - that tree is the body element then
03:25 - perhaps the children of the body element
03:27 - or our paragraphs and inside some of
03:33 - those paragraphs there might be an image
03:35 - as well as an anchor link you could
03:37 - think of this tree so what I want to do
03:41 - is say hmm when I create this canvas
03:43 - what if I could say attach it as a child
03:47 - to this particular paragraph and that
03:50 - way it will appear in between these two
03:52 - paragraphs right this is P 1 P 2 P 3
03:55 - which might appear on the page like this
03:57 - and if the canvas it becomes part of P 2
04:01 - it's going to be inside that paragraph
04:04 - as opposed to just being here and the
04:07 - way that you do that is with a function
04:09 - called parents now how do you assign
04:14 - that this particular element as the
04:18 - parent of this canvas
04:19 - how do you refer to one specific element
04:21 - in an HTML page by it I just like like
04:26 - ID I feel like a pose like you want to
04:29 - do it by the I'm just I'm like just
04:32 - acting silly for no reason today but
04:34 - that's I guess the how I am everyday
04:37 - that's just what I do no reason for
04:39 - acting did I do I was talking about
04:42 - something the ID write this paragraph
04:45 - and since paragraph is an ID I can say
04:47 - make the canvas the child of this
04:49 - element the element with this particular
04:52 - ID so let's go look at how you do that
04:54 - and I'm gonna do it in a sort of a
04:58 - strange way what I'm gonna do is I'm
05:01 - going to add a particular I'm going to
05:04 - add a new paragraph and I'm gonna call
05:07 - it canvass P and this is I'm gonna say
05:12 - this paragraph should include the
05:19 - canvass and I'm gonna look at this now
05:22 - and you can see and I spelled should
05:24 - wrong but you can see that paragraph is
05:26 - there and it has an ID canvass P so how
05:30 - do I refer to it now well if I save our
05:34 - canvass equals create canvas and I say
05:37 - canvas parent what what do I say what's
05:42 - the parent the parent is canvas P so
05:46 - remember canvas P is this particular
05:49 - element I want the canvas not to appear
05:51 - at the end of the body but inside that
05:53 - paragraph which is in between the header
05:55 - and the h1 and the other paragraph so
05:59 - now if I do that you can see look at
06:01 - that this paragraph should include the
06:03 - canvas and in fact it does and now this
06:05 - is after so this is how I take an
06:07 - element made in JavaScript and insert it
06:09 - into a particular place in that HTML
06:12 - page with the parent function now one
06:15 - thing you might notice here is didn't we
06:18 - say at one point in our lives that when
06:21 - you refer to an ID you need the pound
06:23 - symbol right the pound symbol right
06:26 - a tag is referred to as just the tag
06:30 - class is referred to as
06:33 - dot the name of the class and an ID is
06:36 - referred to as pound canvas P well in
06:40 - fact this will actually work also in p5
06:43 - but here in this case the pound is
06:45 - essentially assumed because the only
06:48 - thing you can't say make this element
06:51 - the child of these five other elements I
06:54 - mean that sort of works in the
06:55 - biological world in a certain ways I
06:57 - don't know what I'm talking about
06:58 - psychic into that but in the in the Dom
07:01 - element in that in the in the Dom an
07:04 - element can only have one parent it
07:06 - can't have multi can have grandparents
07:08 - because an element could have a parent
07:10 - and that element could have a parent
07:11 - which is interesting and sort of things
07:14 - like elements are nested but if I'm
07:16 - inserting it I need to know which
07:18 - element is its particular specific
07:20 - parent and in that case so the pound is
07:23 - assumed so you can you can put the pound
07:25 - in there if it makes you feel more
07:26 - comfortable with you for life but here
07:28 - it works it's assumed ok ah so I had
07:32 - another idea for this which I think I
07:35 - will let's so this was the act you can
07:38 - stop watching how this is like really
07:40 - where I should stop so nice like seven
07:42 - minute video that child by the way the
07:44 - child function I could also I could also
07:48 - do by by selecting the pair of I by
07:51 - selecting the paragraph and saying
07:53 - paragraph dot child came the child
07:55 - function is just the inverse of hats I
07:57 - was doing so well until I started st.
07:59 - John but you get the idea try it that'll
08:01 - be your exercise ask questions in the
08:02 - comments but I think I want to just like
08:04 - add one more example here which I think
08:06 - would be a useful one let's make an
08:08 - example let's design a page so this is
08:13 - what I want the page to look like I want
08:15 - the page to have a list a list of happy
08:19 - things list of happy things and I want
08:25 - to get one of those bulleted lists with
08:28 - items and I want to have a button that
08:30 - whenever you click it adds something to
08:33 - that list so first there's a header then
08:36 - there's a button and the list is in
08:38 - between those two things but I need to
08:40 - make the elements that are going to go
08:41 - on the list in JavaScript cuz they won't
08:43 - there in advance so let's look at how
08:45 - you might do this let's make this
08:47 - example I'm gonna I'm gonna do say we're
08:48 - just gonna make this together I mean I'm
08:50 - sitting here by myself but and yet
08:53 - cameras probably gonna turn off because
08:54 - I forgot to reset it before I start of
08:56 - this video but I'll fix that when that
08:57 - happens
08:57 - Parent Child too so first let's design
08:59 - the page and I'm gonna say this page is
09:01 - a list of happy things and then a
09:05 - particular kind of HTML element is
09:07 - called an unordered list which is like a
09:10 - bulleted list you can also make an
09:12 - ordered list which would be a numbered
09:14 - list oh let's make an ordered list and
09:19 - then an element would be you know
09:22 - rainbow that's a happy thing and so now
09:25 - if I look at this page you can see then
09:28 - there that is rainbow is the first
09:30 - element that appears and the next
09:33 - element if I say unicorn unicorn is the
09:38 - next thing that appears you can see that
09:40 - these elements are sort of styled and
09:42 - numbered automatically but I want this
09:45 - to be empty nothing's in there and in
09:49 - instead what I want is a button make a
09:53 - happy thing oops that's not that's the
09:55 - ID button make a happy thing so now and
10:01 - maybe I will
10:01 - now let's look at this so look at this
10:05 - here is the page there is and let me
10:09 - just make this so you can see this
10:10 - better here's the page right I want to
10:13 - when I click on that button I want to
10:15 - see new happy things get added to that
10:18 - list and the list is a thing that I set
10:21 - up in HTML but I want to add the content
10:26 - in JavaScript
10:27 - so first what I'll do I think is let's
10:30 - just make an array a happy array rainbow
10:37 - you I can't take credit for the use of
10:39 - the word unicorn somebody said you have
10:41 - rainbows but no unicorns and you're like
10:43 - ok buying unicorns purple is something
10:46 - that makes me happy it's I really like
10:48 - the color purple
10:50 - I know I was gonna say cheese like
10:53 - cheese makes a lot of people happy but
10:54 - I've left like a lactose intolerance
10:56 - thing dark chocolate I don't know
10:58 - oatmeal this is like terrible probiotics
11:04 - I think feel like the bacteria that's
11:06 - like a good thing bacteria is a good
11:07 - thing it's a happy thing bacteria all
11:09 - got a like push our society forward and
11:12 - figure out how to fix our bacteria I
11:13 - have problems with my bacteria old and
11:18 - new rainbow unicorn purple whatever
11:20 - bacteria so the point of what I'm saying
11:21 - is we don't need this canvas I don't
11:25 - need to draw a function what I want to
11:27 - do is what when first of all okay so we
11:30 - can run look at this first thing I need
11:32 - to do is I need to get access to that
11:34 - button how do I get access to that
11:36 - button select by ID so I want a button I
11:41 - want to access that button
11:43 - remember the button in the HTML page I
11:46 - gave it the ID button which means in my
11:51 - code I can access it with the selection
11:54 - by pound button now I want to assign a
12:00 - callback to when I press the button so
12:03 - when I press the mouse on the buttons
12:05 - assign the callback add item now I can
12:11 - say add item and what do I want to make
12:14 - well first of all let's pick a rate
12:17 - let's pick something from that string of
12:19 - happy things so I'll pick a random
12:22 - number between zero and the length of
12:26 - the array I've mentioned this before in
12:29 - previous videos but the random function
12:31 - gives you a flow a decimal number but I
12:34 - need a index into that array so the
12:36 - floor function deletes the decimal part
12:39 - so three point seven nine is just the
12:41 - value three so what I want to do it I
12:43 - could say something like create P and
12:45 - then happy index R so here I'm creating
12:49 - a paragraph element that'll just be on
12:52 - the page so let's do that
12:54 - make a happy thing hello just bacteria
12:57 - that's terrifying
12:59 - and you can see here right as I click
13:01 - I'm getting all those happy things but
13:03 - that's not what I wanted
13:04 - want to make list elements inside that
13:06 - list so first of all is there a list
13:09 - element by the way is the tag Li and Li
13:13 - is a list element so I can actually use
13:16 - the generic create element and say Li so
13:20 - now I can make a list element from that
13:22 - with a piece of text from that array and
13:24 - you can see those list elements are
13:27 - populating but they're not actually
13:28 - inside that ordered list that I set up I
13:32 - want them to be inside this empty HTML
13:34 - element I want to parent them into that
13:36 - element how do I do that
13:39 - ID oops ID equals happy list and then if
13:46 - I store that particular element in a
13:50 - variable and say Li parent happy list
13:54 - now as I make those elements right every
14:00 - time I click the button they are going
14:02 - inside that particular ordered list now
14:05 - I think I have some interaction design
14:07 - issues for the button keeps getting
14:09 - pushed down which is kind of interesting
14:10 - but you can see there's my list of happy
14:13 - things I don't know what's going on
14:17 - anymore in life other than the fact that
14:19 - I actually should just made like videos
14:21 - about programming is that happy thing I
14:23 - think so
14:24 - so here you go this is just another
14:27 - scenario I think that kind of shows you
14:29 - why you might want to use this idea of
14:31 - parent-child in to be able to make Dom
14:35 - elements on the fly in JavaScript and
14:37 - insert them into various parts of your
14:40 - HTML file that have already been created
14:42 - with with the with the elements that are
14:47 - there so I'm really forcing like trying
14:49 - to make these videos like more
14:51 - interesting the cameras go excited
14:53 - shutting me down it's like stop it with
14:55 - the brain bows and bacteria already so
14:57 - and I would suggest to you create a
14:59 - scenario for yourself where you need
15:01 - this design a page maybe make a part of
15:05 - the page where images should get
15:06 - inserted or a part of a page where you
15:08 - should make sure you want to put the
15:09 - canvas or and when you like click on the
15:11 - canvas it makes other elements on the
15:13 - page create a scenario for yourself like
15:15 - this
15:16 - this really was my exercise for you was
15:18 - to like and I kind of did the solution
15:19 - but try doing something similar like
15:21 - this and see how it goes for you and
15:23 - I've got a couple more videos that I'm
15:26 - gonna make and I'll be closing out this
15:27 - section on the Dom
