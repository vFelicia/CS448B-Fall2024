00:00 - [DING]
00:00 - Hello.
00:01 - And welcome to a
new tutorial series
00:03 - on The Coding Train
about a piece of software
00:06 - called Runway.
00:07 - So what is Runway?
00:09 - How do you download and install
Runway and kind of tinker
00:12 - around with it?
00:13 - That's all I'm going to do
in this particular video.
00:15 - Now, let m be clear, Runway is
not something that I've made.
00:18 - Runway is made by a
company, a new company
00:21 - called Runway itself.
00:22 - And it's a piece of software.
00:24 - You can use it and
download it for free.
00:26 - You can use it for free.
00:27 - There are aspects of it that
require Cloud GPU credits,
00:30 - which I'll get into later.
00:31 - And you can get some free
credits and a coupon code
00:34 - that you'll find in the
description of this video.
00:36 - But really I want
to just talk to you
00:37 - about what it is cause
I'm so excited about it,
00:39 - and I'm planning to
use it in the future,
00:41 - in a lot of future tutorials and
coding challenges, and teaching
00:44 - things that I'm going to do.
00:46 - And I also should
just mention that I
00:47 - am an advisor to the
company Runway itself.
00:49 - So I'm involved
in that capacity.
00:51 - All right.
00:51 - So what is Runway?
00:53 - Right here it says machine
learning for creatives.
00:56 - Bring the power of
artificial intelligence
00:58 - to your creative projects
with an intuitive and simple
01:01 - visual interface.
01:02 - Start exploring new
ways of creating today.
01:04 - So this, to me, is
the core of Runway.
01:08 - I am somebody who's
a creative coder.
01:10 - I'm working with
processing and P5JS.
01:12 - You might be working with
other pieces of software.
01:15 - That's just commercial
software, coding environments.
01:18 - You're writing
your own software.
01:20 - And you want to make
use of recent advances
01:22 - in machine learning.
01:24 - You've read about this model.
01:25 - You saw this YouTube
video about this model.
01:26 - Can you use it in your thing?
01:28 - Well, before Runway one of
the things you might have done
01:31 - is find your way to
some GitHub repo that
01:34 - had like this very
long ReadMe about all
01:37 - the different dependencies you
need to install and configure.
01:40 - And then you've got to download
this and install this, and then
01:43 - build this library.
01:44 - And you can really get
stuck there for a long time.
01:47 - So Runway is an all in
one piece of software
01:50 - with an interface that basically
will run machine learning
01:54 - models for you, install
and configure them
01:56 - without you having
to do any other work
01:57 - but press a button
called Install.
01:59 - And it gives you an interface
to play with those models,
02:01 - experiment with those
models, and then broadcast
02:05 - the results of those models to
some other piece of software.
02:08 - And there's a
variety of ways you
02:10 - can do that broadcasting,
through HTTP requests,
02:13 - through OSC messages.
02:14 - And all these things
might not make sense
02:16 - to you, which is totally fine.
02:18 - I am going to poke
through them and show you
02:20 - how they work, with an eye
towards at least showing you
02:22 - how to pair Runway
with processing,
02:25 - and how to pair
Runway with P5JS,
02:26 - and I'll also show you where
there's lots of other examples
02:29 - and things you can do with other
platforms, and stuff like that.
02:32 - So the first step you
should do is click here
02:34 - under Download Runway Beta.
02:35 - It will automatically
trigger a download
02:37 - for Mac OS, Windows, or Linux.
02:39 - I've actually already
downloaded and installed Runway.
02:43 - So I'm going to kind
of skip that step,
02:46 - and just actually
now run the software.
02:48 - Ah.
02:49 - And now it's saying,
welcome to Runway.
02:51 - Sign in to get started.
02:54 - OK.
02:54 - So if you already
have an account,
02:55 - you could just sign
in with your account.
02:57 - I do already have an account.
02:58 - But I'm going to create
a new one, just so we can
03:00 - follow along with the process.
03:01 - So I'm going to go here.
03:02 - Create an account.
03:04 - I'm going to enter my email
address, which is-- shh.
03:06 - Don't tell anyone--
daniel@thecodingtrain.com.
03:09 - Then I'm going to make
a username and password.
03:14 - Now that I've put in my
very strong password,
03:16 - I'm going to click Next.
03:19 - And I'm going to give my
details, Daniel Schiffman,
03:23 - The Coding Train.
03:25 - Create account.
03:26 - Ah.
03:27 - And it's giving me
a verification code
03:29 - to daniel@thecodingtrain.com.
03:31 - Account has now been created,
and I can click Start.
03:35 - So once you've downloaded,
installed Runway, and signed up
03:39 - for an account, logged
into your account,
03:41 - you will find this screen.
03:43 - So if you've been using
Runway for a while,
03:46 - you might then end up here,
clicking on open workspaces,
03:49 - because workspaces are
a way of collecting
03:52 - a bunch of different
models that you
03:54 - want to use for a particular
project into a workspace.
03:57 - But we haven't done any of that.
03:58 - So the first thing
that I'm going to do
04:00 - is just click on Browse Models.
04:02 - So the first thing that I
might suggest that you do
04:04 - is just click on a
model and see what
04:06 - you can do to play with it in
the Runway interface itself,
04:09 - because one of the things that's
really wonderful about Runway
04:12 - is as a piece of software and
an interface you can explore
04:15 - and experiment with the model
to understand how it works,
04:18 - what it does well, what
it doesn't do well,
04:20 - what it does at
all, before starting
04:22 - to bring it into your own
software or your own project.
04:24 - So I'm going to pick this Spade
Coco model, which I have never
04:27 - looked at before.
04:28 - This is very legitimate me.
04:30 - I have no idea what's going to
happen when I click on that.
04:33 - And now, here I can find
out some more information
04:35 - about the model.
04:36 - So I could find out
what does the model do?
04:38 - It generates realistic images
from sketches and doodles.
04:42 - I can find out more
information about the model.
04:45 - For example, this is the paper
that describes this model,
04:49 - "Semantic Image Synthesis
with Spatially Adaptive
04:51 - Normalizations Trained
on COCO-Stuff Data Set."
04:54 - Remember when someone asked, is
this a tutorial for beginners.
04:57 - Well, it is for beginners
in that you're a beginner.
05:00 - You can come here and
play around with it.
05:01 - But you can go very deep too
if you want to find the paper,
05:06 - read through the
notes, and understand
05:08 - more about this model,
how it was built,
05:10 - what data it was trained
on, which is always
05:12 - a very important question
to ask whenever you're
05:14 - using a machine learning model.
05:16 - So we can see there
are attributions here.
05:20 - So this is the organization
that trained the model.
05:23 - These are the
authors of the paper.
05:25 - We can see the size of
it, when it was created,
05:30 - if it's CPU and GPU supported.
05:32 - We could also go under Gallery.
05:34 - And we can see just some
images that have been created.
05:36 - So we can get an idea.
05:37 - This is a model that's
themed around something
05:39 - called image segmentation.
05:41 - So I have an image over here.
05:43 - What does it mean to
do image segmentation?
05:45 - Well, this image is segmented,
divided into a bunch
05:49 - of different segments.
05:50 - Those segments are
noted by color.
05:53 - So there's a purple
segment, a pink segment,
05:56 - a light green segment.
05:57 - And those colors are tied
to labels in the model,
06:01 - essentially, that know
about a kind of thing
06:04 - that it could draw in that area.
06:06 - So you could do image
segmentation in two ways.
06:09 - I could take an existing
image, like an image of me,
06:12 - and try to say, oh, I'm
going to segment it.
06:14 - This is where my head is.
06:15 - This is where my hand is.
06:16 - This is where my hand is.
06:17 - Or I could generate
images by sort
06:19 - of drawing on a blank image,
saying put a hand over here.
06:22 - Put a head over here.
06:23 - So that's what
image segmentation
06:24 - is, at least in the way
that I understand it.
06:26 - What have I done so far?
06:27 - I've downloaded Runway.
06:28 - I've poked around the models.
06:30 - And I've just clicked on one.
06:31 - Now, I want to use that model.
06:32 - I want to play with it.
06:33 - I want to see it run.
06:35 - So I'm going to go here
to Add to Workspace.
06:36 - It's right up here.
06:37 - Add to Workspace.
06:38 - Now, I don't have
a workspace yet.
06:39 - So I need to make one.
06:41 - And I'm going to
call this workspace,
06:42 - I'm going to say Coding
Train Live Stream.
06:45 - So I'm going to do that.
06:46 - I'm going to hit Create.
06:48 - Now, I have a workspace.
06:50 - You can see, this
is my workspace.
06:51 - I have only one model added
to this workspace over here.
06:55 - And it's kind of highlighting
up for me right now what to do.
06:57 - I need to choose
an input source.
06:59 - So every machine learning
model is different.
07:02 - Some of them expect text input.
07:05 - Some of them expect image input.
07:07 - Some of them might
expect input that's
07:09 - arbitrary scientific
data from a spreadsheet.
07:13 - Then the model is going to
take that input in, run it
07:18 - through the model,
and produce an output.
07:19 - And that output
might be numbers.
07:21 - Or it also might be an image.
07:22 - Or it might be more text.
07:23 - So now we're in sort of the
space of a case by case basis.
07:27 - But if I understand image
segmentation correctly,
07:31 - I'm pretty sure the
input and the output
07:35 - are both going to be an image.
07:36 - Let's make a little diagram.
07:38 - So we have this--
07:39 - what was this
model called again?
07:41 - Spade Coco.
07:43 - So we have this
machine learning model.
07:45 - Presumably there's some neural
network architecture in here.
07:49 - Maybe it has some
convolutional layers.
07:51 - This is something we would
want to read that paper
07:53 - to find out more.
07:54 - Runway is going to allow us
to just use it out of the box.
07:56 - And I certainly would
always recommend
07:59 - reading more about this to
learn more about how to use it.
08:02 - So my assumption here is in my
software that I want to build,
08:06 - I want to maybe create a
drawing piece of software
08:09 - that allows a user to
segment down an image.
08:12 - So you can imagine maybe
I'm going to kind of draw
08:16 - something that's one color.
08:17 - Look, I could use
different colored markers.
08:20 - I'm going to sort of fill
this image in with a bunch
08:23 - of different colors.
08:24 - And then I am going to
feed that into the model.
08:27 - And out will come an image.
08:29 - So we have input.
08:32 - And we have output.
08:34 - And again, this is going to
be different for every model
08:36 - that we might pick in Runway.
08:38 - Although, there's a
lot of conventions.
08:40 - A lot of the models
expect images
08:42 - as input and output images.
08:43 - Some of them expect text as
input, and output an image,
08:46 - or image as input
and output text.
08:48 - Et cetera.
08:48 - And so on and so forth.
08:50 - And so now what I want to do
is choose the input source
08:53 - in Runway for the model.
08:54 - So something that's going to
produce a segmented image.
08:58 - So that could be
coming from a file.
09:00 - It could actually come from
a network connection, which
09:02 - I'll get into maybe
in a future video,
09:04 - or you can explore on your own.
09:05 - I'm just going to
pick segmentation.
09:06 - I know.
09:07 - This is like the
greatest thing ever.
09:08 - Because what's just happened
is image segmentation
09:13 - is a common enough feature
of machine learning models
09:16 - that Runway has built into it
an entire drawing engine so
09:20 - that you can play around
with image segmentation.
09:23 - And you can see, these are the
colors for different labels.
09:26 - So it looks like it's a lot
of transportation stuff.
09:31 - So maybe what I
want is let's try
09:33 - let's try drawing some people.
09:34 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
09:39 - Two people with an airplane and
a wineglass flying overhead.
09:43 - OK.
09:45 - How are we doing?
09:48 - Now, I'm going to
choose an output.
09:50 - And I just want to preview.
09:52 - Right?
09:52 - Cause preview right now is,
I don't need to export this.
09:55 - I don't need to use
it somewhere else.
09:57 - I just want to play around
with it in Runway itself.
10:00 - So I'm going to hit Preview.
10:01 - Now I have selected my input,
which is just the segmentation
10:05 - interface of Runway itself.
10:06 - I have selected my output,
which is just a preview.
10:09 - Now, it's time for
me to run the model.
10:11 - And here we go.
10:13 - Run Remotely.
10:14 - So remote GPU enabled.
10:17 - And you can see,
just by signing up
10:18 - for Runway I have $10
in remote GPU credits
10:21 - It'll be interesting to see
how much just running this once
10:24 - actually uses.
10:26 - So one thing I'll
mention now, if you
10:28 - want to get additional
credits, I can go over here.
10:32 - This is like the sort
of icon for my profile.
10:34 - I can click on this.
10:36 - I'm going to go now to here.
10:39 - I'm going to go to
Get More Credits.
10:41 - And this is going to take
me to a browser page.
10:44 - And I could certainly
pay for more credits.
10:47 - But I'm going to click here.
10:48 - And I'm going to redeem
credits by saying CODINGTRAIN
10:52 - right here.
10:53 - So if you would like to get
an additional $10 in credits,
10:56 - you can do this.
10:57 - And we can see now I
should have $20 in credits.
11:01 - So this icon up here,
just so we're clear,
11:04 - this icon up here
is your workspaces,
11:06 - of which I only have one
with one model that's
11:09 - connected to a remote GPU.
11:10 - And if I wanted to
look at other models,
11:12 - I would go here to this icon.
11:14 - All right.
11:14 - Now, I'm going to
press Run Remotely.
11:18 - [DRUM ROLL]
11:24 - Running the model remotely.
11:27 - Whoa!
11:29 - [TA-DA]
11:30 - Oh, my.
11:33 - Oh, it is so beautiful.
11:35 - Mwuah.
11:35 - I cannot believe it.
11:38 - So this is what the Spade
Coco machine learning
11:41 - model generate.
11:42 - It's really interesting
to see the result here.
11:45 - So you could think,
me knowing nothing
11:47 - about this model, kind of how
it works and what to expect,
11:50 - you get some pretty
weird results with it.
11:53 - Probably if I were a bit more
thoughtful, maybe if I even
11:55 - filled in the entire space--
11:57 - I probably left so
much of it blank,
12:00 - and also included a giant
wine glass with two people.
12:03 - It's kind of creepy looking.
12:05 - Although, I think this
sort of resembles me
12:07 - in some strange sort of way.
12:11 - And we can see here.
12:13 - Look at this.
12:14 - $0.05.
12:15 - So one thing I should
mention is the reason
12:17 - why that took a long
time, it was spinning up
12:19 - the server and everything
to start actually
12:21 - running the model.
12:22 - But now that it's
running in real time,
12:23 - it can happen much more quickly.
12:25 - So let's try filling it.
12:27 - So what would be a good
thing to fill it with?
12:29 - Let's try floor wood.
12:32 - Let's try filling
it with wood floor.
12:34 - Oh, whoa.
12:35 - Then let's try to
put some fruit.
12:38 - Ooh.
12:38 - This is looking much better now.
12:40 - Let's put an orange next to it.
12:45 - Let's put a couple oranges and
make a little bowl of fruit.
12:49 - Wow.
12:49 - This is crazy.
12:52 - Wow.
12:59 - I got to stop.
13:00 - That's pretty amazing.
13:01 - So again, here was just
a little moment later
13:04 - of being a little more
thoughtful to think about how
13:07 - this model actually works.
13:08 - And if I looked at the data
set, which is fairly well-known,
13:14 - I imagine, Coco
image data set, then
13:16 - that's probably going to
give me even more information
13:19 - to think about what
it's going to do well.
13:21 - But you can see how
it's able to sort of see
13:25 - a little pile of fruit
here on a wood background.
13:28 - It almost looks a
little more like cloth,
13:30 - like it's sitting on a table.
13:32 - Pretty realistic.
13:34 - And yes.
13:35 - Charlie England points
out, which is correct,
13:37 - this is continuing to
use the GPU credits.
13:40 - And we can see
that still, though,
13:43 - even with doing a
bunch of live painting,
13:45 - I've just used $0.10 there.
13:46 - So you can do a lot
with the free $10,
13:49 - just in playing around.
13:50 - So input wise, I chose
to do segmentation here.
13:57 - But I could also use a file.
13:59 - So if I wanted to open
a file on the computer,
14:02 - I could do it that way.
14:04 - And then output, if
I change to export,
14:08 - I could also
actually export that
14:10 - to a variety of
different formats.
14:12 - But, of course, I could
also right here just
14:15 - under Preview I can click
this Download Save button.
14:18 - And now I am saving forever
more this particular image
14:23 - as a file.
14:24 - Now, what's really
important here actually,
14:25 - more important here,
is under Network.
14:28 - So if what I wanted to do was
click over here under Network,
14:32 - this means I can now communicate
with this particular machine
14:37 - learning model from
my own software.
14:41 - Whether that's software that
I've downloaded or purchased
14:44 - that somebody else
has made that speaks
14:47 - one of these
particular protocols,
14:49 - or my own software
that I'm writing in
14:51 - just about any programming
language or environment
14:53 - if you have a framework,
or module, or a library,
14:57 - or support these
types of protocols.
15:00 - And one of the nice things
here, if I click on JavaScript,
15:03 - we can see there's actually a
bit of code here that you can
15:06 - actually just copy/ paste
into your JavaScript to run it
15:09 - directly.
15:10 - So I'm going to come back.
15:12 - OSC is also a really popular
messaging network protocol
15:17 - for creative coders.
15:18 - It stands for Open
Sound Control and allows
15:19 - you to send data
between applications.
15:22 - So I will also kind of come
back in a separate video
15:27 - and show you about how
some of these work.
15:29 - I should also probably mention
that your Runway software
15:32 - itself works in a very similar
way to a piece of software
15:36 - called Wekinator that you
might be familiar with.
15:38 - Wekinator is a software that
was created by Rebecca Fiebrink
15:43 - years ago that
allows you to train
15:46 - a neural network with data
sent over OSC messaging,
15:50 - and then get the results
of that after the fact.
15:53 - Though, I think the real sort
of key difference here is Runway
15:57 - is really set up to
support a huge treasure
16:00 - trove of pre-trained models.
16:03 - Whereas Wekinator was more
for training neural networks
16:06 - on the fly with
small bits of data.
16:09 - And I will say that one of the
things that Runway is planning,
16:11 - maybe by September,
is to start coming out
16:14 - with features for training
your own model as well.
16:17 - So thanks for watching this
introduction to Runway,
16:19 - just sort of the basics of
downloading and installing
16:22 - the software, what it is from a
high level point of view, what
16:25 - features of the interface work,
how to get some free cloud
16:29 - credits.
16:29 - And what I would
suggest that you
16:31 - do after watching this video
is download, run the software,
16:35 - and go to this

16:36 - So you can see, there's
a lot of different models
16:38 - for looking at motion,
generative, community, text,
16:41 - recognition.
16:42 - Click around here.
16:43 - Let's try this recognition one.
16:45 - Face recognition.
16:46 - Dense cap.
16:47 - Where is PoseNet in here?
16:50 - That might be under motion?
16:53 - DensePose PoseNet.
16:54 - So here's a model
called PoseNet which
16:57 - performs real time skeletal
tracking of one or more people.
17:00 - I've covered this model
in other libraries,
17:03 - like the ML5 JS library
with TensorFlow JS.
17:06 - And so what I'm going
to do in the next video
17:08 - is use this model, PoseNet,
in Runway with my webcam,
17:13 - running it locally
on this computer
17:14 - without requiring
cloud credits, and then
17:17 - get the results of this model
in [? processing ?] itself.
17:19 - So I'm going to show
you that whole workflow.
17:21 - But poke around.
17:21 - Click around.
17:22 - Find a model that you like.
17:23 - Let me know about
it in the comments.
17:25 - Share images that
you made with it.
17:26 - And I look forward to seeing
what you make with runway.
17:28 - Great.
17:29 - Thanks for watching.
