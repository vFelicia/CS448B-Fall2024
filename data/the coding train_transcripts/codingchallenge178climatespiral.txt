00:00 - hello welcome to a special coding train
00:02 - Earth Day coding challenge so today I'm
00:05 - going to attempt to make my own version
00:07 - a p5gs version of the climate spiral
00:10 - this is a visualization designed by
00:13 - climate scientist Ed Hawkins from the
00:15 - University of reading so take a look at
00:17 - Ed hawkins's website many other data
00:20 - sets and visualizations of those data
00:22 - sets all around climate so in the spiral
00:25 - what you are seeing are monthly Global
00:27 - temperature anomalies starting with the
00:29 - year 1880 all the way up to 2022 so what
00:32 - is a temperature anomaly it's a fancy
00:34 - way of saying a change a difference a
00:36 - deviation from a long-term global
00:39 - average so what's a long-term global
00:42 - average well we need to pick something
00:44 - so for this climate spiral the period
00:46 - from 1951 to 1980 is used so that that
00:50 - 30-year approximately 30-year period the
00:53 - global surface temperature for those
00:55 - years is used as a baseline anything
00:57 - else you're seeing is relative to that
00:59 - Baseline line so in the Years prior you
01:02 - probably see a lot of whites and blues
01:04 - which are showing cooler temperatures
01:05 - lower than that Baseline and as the
01:08 - years go on the oranges and reds in the
01:10 - visualization show warmer temperatures
01:13 - global warming the temperatures
01:15 - themselves the data set is from the NASA
01:18 - Goddard Institute for space studies
01:19 - surface temperature analysis they
01:21 - publish an estimate of global surface
01:23 - temperature change and what I want to do
01:25 - here in this coding challenge a is show
01:27 - you how to download and parse a data set
01:30 - using p5.js and by recreating that
01:34 - climate spiral it's giving us an example
01:37 - visualization that communicates and
01:39 - tells a story about a particular data
01:41 - set now there are many other data sets
01:43 - around climate one that you might take a
01:46 - look at right now is the average
01:48 - temperature of the ocean's surface
01:49 - preliminary data from the National
01:51 - Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
01:54 - or NOAA recently showed that the average
01:56 - temperature at the ocean surface has
01:58 - been at 21.1 1 Celsius since the start
02:01 - of April which is beating the previous
02:03 - high of 21 degrees Celsius set in 2016.
02:07 - a very alarming change the data is clear
02:11 - the Earth is warming helping people to
02:13 - see that and communicate around that
02:15 - data is absolutely a challenge I hope
02:18 - that this video might give you the tools
02:20 - to start thinking about that and maybe
02:22 - you'll be inspired to create your own
02:24 - data visualization around climate all
02:27 - right so first stop is the NASA website
02:29 - uh here we've got an explanation all
02:32 - about the jss surface temperature
02:34 - analysis you can see the latest update
02:36 - here March 15 2023 scrolling down I've
02:40 - got the various data sets that I can
02:42 - download and I'm going to use the global
02:45 - mean monthly seasonal and annual meets
02:48 - 1880 to the present now there are two
02:50 - formats here txt and CSV my assumption
02:53 - is the txt is a tab delimited meaning
02:56 - the data points in the file are
02:58 - separated by tabs and the CSV is a comma
03:02 - separated values or the data points are
03:04 - separated by commas I could use either
03:06 - in P5 but I generally have an easier
03:08 - time working with csvs so let's download
03:10 - that file
03:13 - I can take a quick peek at it just with
03:15 - Mac preview and there we go every year
03:19 - every month and the variation from the
03:23 - Baseline average temperature let's open
03:26 - the file in Visual Studio code this way
03:28 - we can see it without the Mac preview
03:30 - formatting
03:32 - first thing I want to do I think is
03:34 - remove that first row it's important it
03:36 - says what it is Land Ocean Global means
03:38 - but I don't want to have to parse that
03:40 - in P5 I do want the second row there
03:42 - though because those are the column
03:44 - headings for the data
03:46 - all right so the next step would be to
03:48 - bring this file into P5 but I do want to
03:51 - say again whenever you're working with a
03:53 - data set you want to take the time to
03:56 - read the documentation about how the
03:58 - data was collected who collected it and
04:01 - what type of analysis and various other
04:03 - types of things were done in preparation
04:05 - and publication of that data I'll be
04:08 - sure to link to both the 2010 and 2019
04:11 - Publications that give more background
04:13 - and info around the data collection and
04:15 - Analysis process the other thing I want
04:18 - to do just to make my life a little
04:19 - easier is rename the file I'll call it
04:22 - giss data and I'm going to say April 11
04:26 - 2023 in the file name just as a note to
04:29 - self of when I downloaded it now here I
04:31 - am in the P5 web editor I can upload
04:34 - that data file to use with my sketch
04:36 - open up the file browsing menu click
04:39 - upload file and drag the CSV in
04:43 - I can also click on it and see that raw
04:46 - data here in the P5 web editor as well
04:48 - there's also an excellent FAQ page which
04:51 - covers a lot of the questions that you
04:53 - might have around this data set starting
04:55 - with why it's important to look at a
04:57 - variation from a baseline why are you
04:59 - looking at an anomaly versus the
05:01 - absolute temperatures themselves all
05:03 - right how am I going to get this CSV
05:06 - into my P5 code so it just so happens
05:09 - there's a wonderful function in P5
05:12 - called load table
05:16 - and this function takes a file name to
05:20 - load into a table object
05:25 - the load table function does all of the
05:29 - string parsing for you so it figures out
05:31 - that the first row are column headers it
05:34 - knows where the commas are and it's
05:36 - going to allow us to parse through and
05:37 - run through that data much more easily
05:40 - and to figure out all the different
05:42 - kinds of things we can do with the table
05:44 - that we've loaded we need to look at the
05:46 - P5 table documentation so the table has
05:50 - baked into it an array called columns
05:52 - which has all the names of the columns
05:54 - as well as an array of all the rows so
05:57 - each individual row of data is stored as
06:00 - its own object
06:06 - so in our data set I think the columns
06:08 - are something like the year and then the
06:10 - name of the months
06:13 - and then each row is a row of data for
06:16 - any given year
06:20 - so I'm going to want to figure out how
06:22 - to write some kind of for Loop where I
06:25 - can look at every single Row one at a
06:27 - time and then iterate over all of the
06:30 - months now when calling load table I
06:33 - also want to give it not just the file
06:35 - name but a string that says what file
06:38 - format in this case CSV and another
06:40 - string with the keyword header in it
06:43 - which will indicate that there is in
06:45 - fact a single row that has column
06:47 - headers
06:52 - so now I have everything loaded into a
06:54 - variable called data and I'm using the
06:56 - preload function in P5 so that it's
06:58 - ready by the time I get to setup now I
07:00 - want to make sure the data seems all
07:01 - right so a couple things I could do one
07:03 - is let me look at get column count and
07:05 - get row count just to see that I have
07:07 - everything there
07:11 - so I have 146 rows but only one column I
07:15 - forgot what I said before that I need to
07:17 - do which is to additionally give it the
07:20 - format and the fact that there is a
07:21 - header
07:23 - aha so by telling it the format it now
07:26 - knows that there are 19 columns that
07:28 - fixes that and then let me also make
07:30 - sure it knows that there's a header row
07:32 - now it knows that there's only 144 rows
07:35 - because that first one is just the
07:37 - headers now generally speaking when I'm
07:40 - working on a project like this I might
07:42 - use a temporary smaller amount of data
07:45 - like just a file that has the first five
07:47 - rows and I also very much want to make
07:51 - sure that I'm looking at the first five
07:53 - rows of data as well as the last five
07:56 - rows to make sure things look copacetic
07:59 - and I can see here that when I get to
08:02 - 2023 I'm only going to want to take
08:05 - January and February so I'm going to
08:07 - need to build something into the code
08:08 - that knows to ignore these stars or
08:11 - knows where I need to end when I'm doing
08:13 - the visualization or analysis but I'm
08:16 - not really going to take my advice here
08:17 - right now I'm just going to dive in and
08:19 - see what I can get to work in the code
08:21 - itself with the full data file let let's
08:23 - try examining just the first row of data
08:28 - the get row function gives me any given
08:30 - Row from the data set 0 being that first
08:32 - row now I can look at the P5 table row
08:36 - object and see what kind of functions I
08:38 - can call there set set num set string
08:41 - get get num get string okay what do I
08:44 - want to do maybe I want to just get the
08:47 - year and the January temperature anomaly
08:53 - great so we can see that from the row I
08:56 - can pull out a piece of data using the
08:59 - get function so the get function is
09:01 - probably going to always give me back
09:03 - the data as a string as text and since I
09:05 - do want the temperature to be a number I
09:07 - will switch this one to get num and you
09:10 - can even see in the console now it's a
09:12 - different color because it's logging it
09:13 - as a number as a floating Point number
09:15 - rather than its raw text all right I
09:17 - think I understand what I need to do
09:19 - because I'm going to need to go through
09:22 - every year and draw a spiral based on
09:26 - those values all right so using Ed
09:28 - hawkins's website as a basis let me see
09:31 - if I can even just set up the months and
09:33 - the various temperature indicators as a
09:38 - baseline as a sort of background before
09:40 - I draw the spiral over top of it I'm
09:42 - going to translate to put 0 0 in the
09:44 - middle
09:50 - all right I'm picking arbitrary numbers
09:52 - right now we can finesse it later but
09:54 - let's use a diameter of 100 for a zero
09:57 - degrees
10:00 - or did we get the data in Celsius all
10:03 - right looking at the txt version of the
10:05 - same data I downloaded it specifically
10:06 - says Celsius at the top so I'm working
10:08 - with Celsius
10:17 - so now I have a circle to show for zero
10:20 - degrees and one to show for one degree I
10:23 - think I'm going to need a bigger canvas
10:26 - and I need one more Circle to put the
10:29 - month labels around
10:33 - so putting the month labels will be a
10:35 - little tricky but thank goodness for all
10:39 - of the videos I've made over the years
10:40 - that use the concept of polar
10:43 - coordinates I'll give you a quick primer
10:46 - here but I will link to many many videos
10:48 - where I've covered this in great depth
10:51 - so if this is my P5 canvas and I'm
10:54 - considering the center to be zero zero
10:56 - based on that call to translate that I
10:59 - did then normally whenever I talk about
11:02 - a point I'm going to talk about its X Y
11:04 - position but if I want to describe a set
11:07 - of points that are following a radial
11:10 - path around that Center I'm going to
11:12 - want to talk about them in terms of
11:14 - their radius and angle relative to the
11:18 - horizontal axis the distance from the
11:21 - center radius that angle using the Greek
11:24 - letter Theta is a common way to notate
11:26 - it so if I want to place the month
11:29 - January over here maybe that's an angle
11:32 - of 60 degrees with a certain distance
11:36 - from the center but I actually need to
11:38 - know the X Y to be able to draw it in P5
11:41 - and the formula for doing that which I
11:43 - derived in other videos is x equals R
11:47 - times cosine of that angle and y equals
11:52 - R times side of that angle I realize I
11:56 - could also just use translated rotate
11:58 - maybe that would make more sense it's
12:01 - always a question of whether you want to
12:03 - calculate and do the math yourself or
12:05 - use transformations in P5 and by the way
12:07 - I also have videos around
12:09 - transformations in P5 I'm going to think
12:11 - about this as I walk back over there and
12:13 - by the time I get there I'll have picked
12:15 - one method of doing this all right I'm
12:17 - going to use polar coordinates because
12:19 - that's really what I'm going to need
12:20 - when I start doing the spiral of
12:22 - temperatures themselves but as an
12:24 - exercise you might try placing all the
12:26 - labels without polar coordinates and
12:27 - just use translate and rotate I also
12:29 - want to get the labels from the CSV file
12:32 - itself so let me make a array called
12:35 - months
12:36 - well it'll just be a variable called
12:38 - months and I'm going to say months
12:41 - equals data dot columns let's just see
12:44 - console log months
12:48 - we can take out these console logs
12:52 - okay so that's giving me an array with
12:54 - those it does have year in it so why
12:56 - don't I make a copy of it with DOT slice
13:00 - and then months dot splice let me take
13:04 - out that first element splice is a
13:06 - function where you remove an element
13:07 - from an array so now I have an array
13:09 - with all the months in it
13:15 - and let's start the first one at the top
13:17 - which would be zero negative 250.
13:25 - so all the months are being drawn right
13:27 - on top of each other so I need to start
13:29 - moving them according to Polar
13:31 - coordinates
13:33 - so I need to map I which is counting
13:35 - through the array which goes from 0 to
13:38 - the number of months
13:40 - to an angle and if it's relative to the
13:43 - horizontal axis the top is going to be
13:46 - negative pi divided by 2 which is
13:49 - radians for negative 90 degrees I think
13:52 - this is going to be easier to work out
13:54 - if we just think of it from 0 to 360
13:56 - degrees or 0 to 2 pi and then I'll shift
13:59 - it if I need to
14:01 - and also I just realized that I don't
14:05 - need to use slice and then splice so if
14:07 - you were shouting at the screen earlier
14:09 - I'm now going to fix that I could just
14:11 - actually say slice and give it one which
14:14 - will give me a copy of the array
14:15 - starting with the second element or
14:17 - index one so now X is 250 times cosine
14:22 - of the angle
14:24 - and Y is 250 times sine of the angle
14:28 - oh look at that so I'm not paying
14:32 - attention to the details of my data set
14:34 - there's actually 18 column headers but
14:37 - there's not 18 months so why don't I say
14:41 - from 1 to 13 that's going to give me all
14:44 - 12 months and you can see it's working
14:46 - but January is off to the right
14:49 - so let's just say that angle is
14:52 - everything minus pi divided by 2 whoops
14:56 - not there not the map after minus pi
14:59 - divided by 2 and in the original version
15:02 - December is at the top so let's actually
15:04 - make that happen how would I do that
15:07 - all right so there's probably some
15:09 - clever ways that I could do this but how
15:11 - about I just type out the months in the
15:13 - order that I want them and actually in
15:16 - that sense I don't need to do this shift
15:18 - because I just want to have March be the
15:22 - first one
15:28 - [Music]
15:30 - oh they don't line up at the top wait
15:33 - March June July oh I've left out
15:36 - September
15:38 - all right so mine doesn't look exactly
15:40 - but oh no I forgot February no wonder
15:44 - there we go everybody
15:46 - we kind of get all 12 months in people
15:49 - I'm just checking to see if you're
15:51 - paying attention that's all something
15:52 - that would also might be nice is I can
15:54 - rotate the text to line up with that
15:57 - Circle
16:04 - there we go we now have a base pattern
16:07 - for the climate spiral okay it's time
16:12 - for some data let's start by drawing one
16:15 - ring for one year so remember I can get
16:19 - the first row with get row index 0.
16:24 - then what I want to do is use my month's
16:27 - array to get the anomaly value for every
16:31 - single month
16:36 - let's add no Loop and console log that
16:38 - just to see that it works
16:40 - P5 is telling me there is a reserved
16:44 - word value so I'll change that to
16:46 - anomaly
16:48 - and I also could look at the year
16:54 - and the original design put the year in
16:57 - the center so let's draw it there
17:02 - so now I just need a way to draw the
17:05 - spiral and in fact I can use the same
17:08 - exact polar coordinate math to place a
17:12 - data point around this radial path in
17:15 - the same way that I did the months
17:20 - now I need to remember that 90 degree
17:22 - offset because I'm starting from the top
17:26 - and let's try to place the points along
17:29 - the zero degrees right now
17:34 - okay so you can see what I've done is in
17:37 - the same way I placed all the months
17:39 - around the outer ring I've now placed a
17:43 - DOT around the inner ring that is where
17:46 - zero degrees that Baseline temperature
17:48 - is indicated so something I should
17:51 - really do here when I was setting this
17:53 - layout initially I just hard coded a lot
17:55 - of values but now it's very important
17:57 - that I know that zero degrees means 50
18:00 - pixels from the center and one degree
18:03 - means 100 pixels from the center
18:06 - 150 pixels from the center so let's set
18:09 - up some Global variables
18:11 - I'll call it the zero radius
18:14 - and the one radius maybe the distance
18:17 - between the center and zero needs to be
18:19 - equal to the distance between zero and
18:22 - one
18:24 - so how about 75 and 150.
18:27 - so zero degrees is at zero radius
18:30 - plus some offset for the text
18:33 - maybe 10 pixels
18:35 - this one degrees is at one radius
18:39 - then I need to size those circles
18:41 - correctly
18:44 - and now the X and Y positions of these
18:48 - dots are going to be mapped to the
18:50 - actual data
18:53 - so to figure out what values need to go
18:55 - in the map function I just need to look
18:58 - at what are the pixel values associated
19:01 - with specific degree values zero degrees
19:05 - and one degree are associated with pixel
19:08 - 75 and 150. it's important to note that
19:12 - the math function is really special you
19:14 - don't have to know the specific minimum
19:17 - and maximum of your range you just need
19:19 - to establish some corresponding values
19:22 - between two ranges which I have right
19:24 - here so even if I have negative values
19:26 - it's going to figure out where to place
19:28 - those correctly below pixel 75 and
19:32 - values that are greater than one degree
19:33 - Beyond pixel 150. so those are all the
19:38 - values for 1880. if I pick a different
19:41 - year like
19:43 - row 50 which is 1930 those are the
19:47 - values
19:48 - 1980 and so 2020 would be row 140 great
19:53 - so I believe that this mapping is now
19:55 - accurate but I'm not just looking to
19:58 - place dots I'm looking to connect
20:00 - everything with a spiral pattern so I'm
20:03 - going to add begin shape an end shape
20:07 - and say no fill
20:10 - stroke 255 and instead of a circle I'm
20:13 - going to set a vertex
20:15 - and right now I'm going to put close so
20:17 - that it connects the last point to the
20:19 - new point so what should I do next let's
20:23 - see if we can add another loop to Loop
20:27 - through every single row every year all
20:30 - at once get row count is going to give
20:33 - me the total number of rows
20:38 - so now I have an outer loop going
20:39 - through every row
20:41 - let me bring this in
20:45 - so now instead of hard coding row 140
20:48 - for the year 2020 I can put in j
20:52 - um undefined let's simplify things for a
20:55 - moment by not drawing the year because I
20:57 - might need to do that in a different way
20:58 - this is maybe the most unhelpful error
21:01 - message I've ever seen my suspicion is
21:04 - there might be some elements of the data
21:06 - set that are actually null or empty we
21:08 - saw those asterisks and that could be
21:10 - messing things up let's see if we can
21:11 - debug this let's put in a console log
21:14 - for the anomaly
21:16 - all right let's try doing just two years
21:21 - that worked three
21:24 - four
21:25 - 100
21:28 - all right so I must be right it must be
21:30 - getting to some point in the data where
21:33 - there is no anomaly reading
21:37 - and I can see that that happens right
21:39 - there at the end of the data set where
21:41 - the asterisks appear the quick scan I
21:43 - see some asterisks up here but that's
21:46 - additional data that I'm not using so I
21:49 - think we're okay
21:50 - I wonder if the get num will give me
21:54 - undefined so let me just see if
21:57 - anomaly
21:59 - it's not equal to undefined
22:02 - what if I don't use get numb but instead
22:06 - just use get oh oh wow it's able to
22:09 - interpret it as a number even with just
22:10 - get that's interesting oh I was going to
22:13 - say then I could check to make sure it's
22:16 - not a star star
22:18 - and then I thought what I would need to
22:21 - do
22:22 - is say anomaly equals number anomaly
22:30 - but that doesn't seem to be necessary so
22:32 - I'll just leave that commented out
22:34 - sometimes JavaScript is just such a
22:36 - friendly place to be it's like I don't
22:38 - know if it's a string but you want to
22:40 - use it as a number I'll just figure out
22:42 - I kind of get what you want and I'll
22:44 - make it work so look I think we just
22:46 - drew the entire climate spiral there a
22:49 - couple things I think it would make more
22:52 - sense to expand the range so we don't
22:56 - have a lot of values Beyond one degree
22:58 - so maybe I should increase that radius
23:03 - now weirdly it didn't change did I hard
23:06 - code the numbers in the map function I
23:09 - did I did didn't I
23:12 - okay I like this a little bit better it
23:15 - just gives me a little bit more space to
23:17 - work with I'm just checking again to see
23:19 - if you're paying attention I'm pretty
23:21 - sure I misspelled anomaly yeah I did
23:25 - it's with an a
23:28 - oh and I definitely don't want clothes
23:30 - anymore
23:31 - do I want to connect the end of the
23:34 - previous year to the next one I guess
23:35 - that makes sense as long as I don't have
23:36 - clothes at the end why are there so many
23:38 - lines going across the center though
23:39 - that's a little bit weird should I work
23:42 - on animating it first or adding color
23:44 - maybe I should animate this first
23:45 - because that's going to help us see that
23:47 - this is working and what it's doing what
23:49 - I wanted to do so right now the code has
23:52 - two for Loops one Loop to go through
23:55 - every single row and one Loop to go
23:58 - through every single month let's start
24:00 - by doing the years one at a time
24:04 - so I think a better name for this
24:05 - variable would be current row
24:08 - then we get rid of this Outer Loop
24:12 - in fact I'm just going to delete it and
24:14 - then the row is the current row
24:18 - so that's that first row 1880. I can get
24:22 - rid of no Loop and I can start to
24:25 - increase the row
24:29 - ah okay so I'm seeing each year one at a
24:33 - time eventually I get to the end and
24:35 - it's an error and I just realized that
24:37 - I'm not seeing the previous one so maybe
24:40 - what I should actually do well there's
24:42 - so many different ways I could approach
24:43 - this so I could just draw the base
24:46 - background and then let the different
24:48 - years build up but because it's not a
24:51 - lot to draw just give me full
24:53 - flexibility I do want to put that loop
24:55 - back in
24:59 - so the row I want to get is J but I only
25:03 - want to iterate from zero all the way up
25:05 - to that current row
25:08 - so we can see them layering very quickly
25:11 - because I'm doing remember the whole
25:13 - year all at once let's see if we can do
25:15 - one month at a time so now I need a
25:19 - current month
25:22 - and this Loop
25:24 - should be just all the way up to the
25:26 - current month
25:27 - so first let me fix it so that when it
25:30 - gets to the end it doesn't just crash
25:31 - current row equals current row plus one
25:35 - if current row equals data dot get row
25:41 - count then no Loop
25:44 - that'll stop it
25:48 - great that worked what happened to the
25:50 - months oh I put current month there
25:53 - that's the wrong place I put current
25:56 - month in drawing the months I want to
25:58 - see all the months
26:00 - no wonder that didn't work I want to do
26:01 - current months here
26:05 - so every frame
26:07 - current month should go up by one
26:12 - if current month gets to the end
26:16 - that's when the row increases
26:20 - count up all the months oh and then the
26:22 - month has to go back to zero
26:25 - well it's like a little weird radar
26:26 - thing ah clearly I have my begin shape
26:29 - and N Shape in the wrong place let me
26:31 - slow down the frame rate
26:33 - oh oh no no no no no no no no okay the
26:38 - current month is only the current month
26:40 - for the current year so basically if J
26:45 - is less than current row minus one then
26:50 - let total months well I could just say
26:52 - total months is always the length of the
26:54 - array but if J is the last one
26:58 - current row minus one total months
27:01 - equals the current month and then I'm
27:04 - iterating to the total months
27:07 - that's probably a better way to do this
27:08 - let's try that again now
27:14 - there we go that's what I wanted to see
27:17 - okay I think things are good now
27:20 - I would like to move the zero further
27:22 - out to leave more space in the middle
27:24 - because the negative numbers are getting
27:27 - very very close
27:31 - you can up the frame rate now
27:33 - [Music]
27:37 - I'm going to move zero even further out
27:41 - I'm also going to make the text
27:42 - alignment uniform for everything and
27:45 - just put text align Center at the
27:46 - beginning of draw
27:48 - all right I want to put what year we're
27:51 - currently on in the center
27:57 - let's make that year a little bit bigger
28:01 - oh no there's another big mistake here
28:04 - which is that the values are starting
28:06 - from the bottom because my angle is
28:09 - offset by pi over 2
28:12 - so it should start at the top only it
28:14 - really starts at January the first data
28:17 - point is January so it's minus pi
28:20 - divided by 2 plus pi divided by three oh
28:24 - dear minus pi divided by 3.
28:28 - yeah that's right okay so I did this in
28:31 - a terrible way and I'll leave that as an
28:33 - exercise to the viewer to re-factor this
28:36 - if you will to be a little bit more
28:38 - consistent about how I'm drawing and
28:40 - reading the data but I do have
28:42 - everything I believe aligned correctly
28:44 - right now and I can add color
28:47 - so I want to do something similar in the
28:50 - same way I'm mapping the distance from
28:52 - the center to that anomaly value I want
28:55 - to map color maybe zero degrees is white
28:57 - and anything less than that is a blue
28:59 - tone and greater than that is a red tone
29:02 - will lerp color work for me
29:05 - oh but the line segments hmm so this is
29:09 - tricky I think I have to draw these as
29:11 - individual line segments now to change
29:13 - their color I think I have to manually
29:15 - connect these I'm going to slow down the
29:18 - frame rate here
29:20 - so I just noticed that with a frame rate
29:22 - of one I have to wait for like a whole
29:24 - empty year because my current row is
29:28 - zero which isn't actually the current
29:30 - row it's the current row cut off which
29:33 - should really be one to start and I
29:36 - guess I could do the same thing with
29:37 - month
29:38 - so for me to draw a color I need to draw
29:40 - each one of those lines individually so
29:43 - I can no longer use begin shape
29:46 - and N Shape
29:48 - instead I need to have the previous
29:51 - anomaly so let me make a variable call
29:54 - it previous anomaly
29:57 - R is the current anomaly
30:00 - and PR
30:03 - is mapping the previous anomaly
30:07 - then I need X1 y1 and X2 Y2
30:16 - draw a line between both of them
30:20 - this is interesting what do I have here
30:23 - oh because previous anomaly is always
30:25 - zero so as soon as I get the new anomaly
30:28 - now right before I get the new anomaly
30:30 - no no right after okay so after I do
30:34 - this
30:37 - so I just need to save the previous one
30:39 - oh but they need the previous angle
30:42 - but I could calculate that is it silly
30:44 - because I could just look up what was
30:45 - before but maybe it's helpful to store
30:48 - it because then I don't have to deal
30:49 - with like the end points
30:52 - you're really going to make this better
30:54 - after you watch this aren't you please
31:00 - okay let's see here oh I don't have the
31:03 - angle sure let's let's put this inside
31:05 - the if statement there's no reason to
31:07 - save the anomaly if it's bad data
31:10 - oh this is very strange
31:13 - why is there an extra line
31:16 - I guess it's very silly to just store
31:18 - the previous one I know that they're all
31:20 - offset by 30 degrees or pi divided by 6.
31:26 - in the previous one is minus
31:30 - I can't do this for the first value I oh
31:33 - as long as it's not the very first okay
31:36 - this is still working correctly but I'm
31:40 - gonna have a Boolean variable that says
31:42 - first value is false and
31:47 - as long as it's not the first value
31:51 - draw the line
31:54 - and then say first value is true
31:59 - oh is false
32:01 - the first value is true this is the
32:04 - first value so don't draw the line there
32:07 - we go I'm really making a mess with this
32:10 - I think this is correct now I'm drawing
32:12 - them a separate line segments let's get
32:15 - rid of this previous angle concept
32:18 - they don't need that let me up the frame
32:21 - rate so we can kind of I still want to
32:22 - be able to watch it somewhat slowly
32:25 - think it's working
32:28 - Let's uh max out the frame rate
32:32 - I just want to see what happens at the
32:33 - end
32:34 - [Music]
32:47 - all right didn't get an error I'm not
32:49 - entirely sure it was hard for me to see
32:51 - if it ended properly because I don't
32:53 - have any color differences to to help me
32:55 - understand visually what's going on but
32:58 - I think it's all all right I think I can
33:00 - finally add color right if I just insert
33:03 - a stroke here like for example with red
33:08 - now all of the lines are red obviously
33:11 - if I add some blue they're all going to
33:13 - be pink and I can put any color in here
33:16 - I want and I'm going to see that color
33:17 - but if we look back at the original
33:19 - reference visualization the colder
33:23 - anomalies less than zero had blue tones
33:26 - the warmer anomalies greater than zero
33:29 - had red tones let's use the Whiteboard
33:31 - for a second to map this out so we have
33:34 - an anomaly let's just say for the sake
33:36 - of argument that the anomaly is
33:38 - somewhere between negative 1 degrees and
33:41 - positive one degree with zero degrees
33:43 - being in the center and I want to have a
33:45 - color that's red over here
33:48 - and I want to have a color that is blue
33:51 - over here
33:53 - so if I ever have a scenario like this
33:56 - the thing that I always think about is
33:58 - linear interpolation or lurk
34:02 - the idea of lerp is I have some minimum
34:06 - value
34:08 - and some Maximum value or they don't it
34:11 - doesn't actually have to be lower and
34:12 - bigger but I have some starting value
34:15 - and ending value and I want to
34:17 - interpolate between them as if from zero
34:20 - percent maybe to a hundred percent
34:23 - so the lerp function in P5 typically
34:27 - takes three arguments
34:29 - a b and an amount
34:32 - the amount being a value between 0 and 1
34:36 - this corresponding to a and this
34:39 - corresponding to B
34:41 - there is in fact in P5 lerp color
34:45 - so lerp color will do exactly the same
34:48 - thing as lerp it will just lurp the r
34:51 - value the G value and the B value all by
34:54 - the same amount so in essence I could
34:56 - just use the anomaly value as
35:01 - the amount that wouldn't work exactly
35:04 - though because the amount should be
35:06 - between 0 and 1 and my anomalies are
35:09 - positive and negative also if I look
35:11 - back at the original climate spiral the
35:15 - one that Ed Hawkins made at zero the
35:18 - color is actually White
35:20 - so I think what I want to do is have two
35:22 - lerps I want to have a lerp for any
35:24 - negative values that goes from Red
35:27 - to White and alert for any positive
35:29 - values that goes from white to Blue
35:32 - let's see how that goes
35:35 - so in the code I need three colors cold
35:41 - which I'll just arbitrarily set to pure
35:43 - blue I mean we could be more thoughtful
35:45 - about the color palette but I'm not
35:46 - going to be warm which should be red
35:51 - and then I'm just going to call it zero
35:53 - I mean there's a better variable name
35:55 - but they'll have four letters and I love
35:57 - how they line up like that so zero will
35:59 - be just pure white then my lerp should
36:02 - happen between cold and zero or zero and
36:07 - warm depending on if the average anomaly
36:09 - is positive or negative
36:11 - so if average is less than zero my color
36:14 - oh so I need a default color I'll just
36:18 - call it line color well it'll be white
36:21 - if something goes wrong but if average
36:24 - is less than zero then the line color
36:27 - will lurp from cold to zero
36:33 - the bigger the averages all the way to
36:37 - zero oh wait wait wait wait wait wait
36:40 - but average is a negative value zero to
36:43 - a hundred percent zero to a hundred
36:45 - percent just flip the negative to a
36:47 - positive
36:48 - so
36:51 - zero all the way to cold
36:54 - based on the absolute value of that
36:57 - average value stroke
36:59 - line color
37:01 - average is not defined oh I have to make
37:04 - the average I want the average of the
37:07 - anomaly but if it's a line segment I
37:09 - have two values I want the color to be
37:11 - the average of these two values so I do
37:13 - need to calculate that
37:17 - oh no oh no we've got a problem a few
37:21 - different issues one is I'm not using
37:23 - lerp I'm using lerp Color the regular
37:27 - lerp is going to fail but this also
37:29 - isn't working and I think I know what
37:31 - the problem is remember a while ago when
37:34 - I was saying how JavaScript is just so
37:36 - friendly to us it's going to figure it
37:37 - out
37:39 - sometimes JavaScript is just such a
37:41 - friendly place to be it's like I don't
37:43 - know if it's a string but you want to
37:45 - use it as a number I'll just figure out
37:47 - I kind of get what you want and I'll
37:49 - make it work
37:51 - this averaging of the two values is
37:54 - actually concatenating the string so I
37:56 - really do need to convert that to a
37:58 - number and this uh I think parse float
38:01 - might make more sense doesn't really
38:03 - matter those are same parse float is a
38:05 - function that will take a string and
38:06 - parse it into a floating Point ah so you
38:09 - can see it's working now so I should be
38:11 - able to then say if I the average is now
38:14 - greater than zero
38:16 - go between zero and the warm value
38:20 - and let's have this go up by more than
38:22 - just one month at a time so I can see it
38:25 - happening faster how about four months
38:27 - at a time
38:28 - oh because I'm checking if it's equal
38:30 - and current month starts at zero so the
38:34 - one so currently started at zero for it
38:36 - to for four to be divisible into twelve
38:39 - okay
38:40 - this is looking pretty good now it's a
38:42 - lot more red than blue but that's simply
38:45 - because
38:46 - of the of the mappings are equivalent
38:49 - and we're not getting as far to negative
38:51 - one as we are as we didn't we didn't
38:54 - start we don't have a lot of cooler
38:56 - temperatures than the Baseline but boy
38:58 - is the Earth getting warmer which is
39:00 - actually showing now design wise I'm
39:02 - sure there could be quite a few
39:04 - improvements here you can see some of
39:06 - the layout improvements there's actually
39:08 - oh there's actually a ring for negative
39:11 - one that kind of makes sense maybe I
39:14 - should adjust that I'll leave as an
39:15 - exercise to you to think about how you
39:18 - might visually improve this and also I'm
39:21 - looking at this original version right
39:23 - now and as soon as it gets to the end we
39:25 - can speed it up and see what happens
39:27 - you're going to be very excited to see
39:28 - what happens
39:29 - our weights
39:31 - the year is also changing color as it's
39:34 - going
39:35 - to get to the end here comes
39:40 - and look at that all along the Rings
39:43 - were separated by a z position and now
39:46 - we see them as this amazing stack so I
39:49 - would have to do a lot to my code to get
39:52 - there but I think this is if if I don't
39:55 - say so myself a decent version of the
40:00 - climate spiral there are probably
40:02 - imperfections there are many visual
40:04 - design improvements that you could make
40:06 - but I wanted to give you a baseline to
40:08 - look at how you would get through this
40:10 - whole story of downloading a data set
40:13 - parsing that data set and connecting it
40:15 - to visuals so now you if you feel so
40:18 - inclined please take this code refactor
40:21 - it to make it more organized maybe you
40:23 - have a different thought Beyond just
40:24 - Rings maybe you want to add the 3D
40:26 - component change the whole Paradigm of
40:29 - how it's being visualized also I
40:31 - referenced the global C Surface
40:33 - temperatures which are rising at an
40:36 - alarming rate right now I won't include
40:38 - a link to downloading that data that if
40:40 - you want to look at visualizing that
40:42 - data leave a question or thought in the
40:44 - comments about how I could improve this
40:45 - I hope you enjoyed this coding Challenge
40:47 - and that you spend some time enjoying
40:50 - nature and the Earth today which is what
40:52 - I'm going to do right now after I blow
40:55 - the train whistle pop up
41:00 - [Music]
