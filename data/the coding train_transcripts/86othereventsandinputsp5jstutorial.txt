00:02 - okay I'm in another video now this one
00:04 - I'm fresh I'm losing steam but I'm going
00:07 - to make this video somehow take a break
00:09 - and if you're watching these in sequence
00:10 - I'm finally going to get to this
00:12 - discussion that I've been
00:12 - procrastinating and stalling because I'm
00:14 - afraid of it but I I want to talk about
00:16 - CSS cascading stylesheets the style
00:19 - function in pp5 what's the difference
00:20 - between those two things but that's the
00:22 - next video right now I want to look at
00:24 - some more events that uh that that you
00:27 - can handle in JavaScript in the browser
00:30 - page in P5 besides just Mouse press so
00:33 - what's the context of this discussion
00:35 - VAR button equals create
00:41 - button
00:43 - button. mous
00:46 - press and the call back the name of the
00:50 - call back goes here so this is the only
00:53 - event that we've looked at you have this
00:56 - button you click on the button and this
01:00 - code whatever the code inside this
01:01 - function you know
01:04 - function do
01:07 - it and if I reference do it here do I
01:12 - don't know what that means uh if I
01:14 - reference the name of the function here
01:16 - this code is executed when you click
01:18 - what are some other events that are part
01:21 - of the browser that P5 handles for you
01:23 - again now one thing I should mention is
01:25 - you don't need P5 to do any of this this
01:27 - is not an invention of P5 I'm using P5
01:30 - as a as a as a library that gives you a
01:33 - set of functionality to access a lot of
01:35 - what's available in Native JavaScript in
01:38 - many other JavaScript Frameworks in uh
01:40 - you know jQuery being probably the most
01:41 - well-known and famous one of these
01:43 - Frameworks that is incredibly
01:44 - sophisticated a huge library with tons
01:46 - of event functionality that you can
01:48 - handle but I'm using the P5 Library as a
01:52 - as an entry point to this much larger
01:54 - topic of JavaScript in the browser and
01:56 - later in some video try to peel back
01:58 - those layers and compare and contrast
01:59 - with other types of ways of doing the
02:01 - same
02:02 - thing breathe so but what are the events
02:05 - that I want to show you in this video so
02:07 - here are some other ones Mouse
02:10 - over Mouse
02:14 - out
02:16 - changed
02:18 - input so with any of these four other
02:22 - events the process is exactly the same
02:25 - if I want to know when you Mouse over
02:27 - the button I say mouse over another
02:30 - function to handle that Mouse over now
02:32 - the thing about the button which it in
02:34 - some ways it was a great example because
02:36 - it's so sort of obvious what you want to
02:37 - do with a button click on it but all of
02:40 - these events are available for any kind
02:42 - of Dom element that you might create you
02:44 - can click on a paragraph you can click
02:46 - on a H1 element you can click on the
02:49 - canvas you can Mouse over a canvas you
02:51 - can determine when a slider has changed
02:55 - its value um so let's let's I'm going to
02:58 - return back to the code and see what
02:59 - happens if I attach some of these other
03:02 - events to other Dom elements and
03:04 - ultimately what is it you probably want
03:06 - to do you want to like when you Mouse
03:08 - over an element you want to highlight it
03:10 - by changing its style oh wouldn't it be
03:12 - nice if I there was a video about CSS
03:14 - and style I guess maybe I'm not doing
03:16 - these in the best order but you can
03:17 - watch them in whatever order you want
03:18 - that's kind of the magic here so let's
03:20 - look at the and I'll come back to these
03:22 - events in the CSS uh video so let's come
03:26 - over here and let's look at what what
03:28 - types of elements are on the page so
03:30 - right now there's this paragraph element
03:32 - there's a button there's a slider
03:34 - there's a text field so let's look at a
03:37 - few different kinds of events I'm going
03:42 - to uh handle first let's look at the
03:45 - paragraph so what if I were to say name
03:49 - p. Mouse
03:51 - over
03:53 - uh uh and what should I do to that
03:55 - paragraph um I'm going to just call a
03:57 - function like over
04:00 - Pera oh boy I'm I'm terrible with
04:03 - variable names but now this means that
04:06 - when I Mouse over this Dom element I
04:09 - want oh
04:10 - boy darkness is upon me oh it's sunlight
04:13 - look the sun is shining right on me this
04:15 - is wow look at this is kind of exciting
04:16 - moment the green screen stuff I have
04:18 - this window open and sunlight I need
04:19 - sunlight we all need sunlight you should
04:22 - stop programming now and go get some
04:23 - vitamin D uh sorry about this sort of
04:26 - weird shadowing thing that's going on I
04:27 - kind of I'm kind of enjoying it I'm
04:29 - looking at myself myself over here
04:30 - that's why I just keep staring over here
04:31 - it's very vain of me anyway let's we had
04:33 - we had a video a topic sorry okay where
04:36 - am I Mouse over when I Mouse over this
04:39 - paragraph this over PA function should
04:42 - get executed so I need to write a
04:44 - function called over I'm probably
04:47 - standing in front of this right now over
04:49 - Pera that's a terrible name for a
04:51 - function so what might I do when I uh
04:55 - execute that function is uh I might
04:57 - change name p
05:00 - HTML your mouse is over
05:05 - me and you know what let's just go crazy
05:07 - here and let's also do mouse out out
05:11 - perah and I could write a function and
05:15 - let me zoom out here so maybe you can
05:16 - see this better uh out
05:19 - Pera uh name p. HTML your mouse is out
05:24 - you're out isn't that like from some
05:27 - you're in you're out it's like my kidi
05:29 - Clum
05:30 - this a very that's a someone watch this
05:32 - in the future the aliens will be
05:33 - watching this video and W won't get that
05:34 - cultural reference I'm not sure I even
05:36 - do okay um okay so what's going on here
05:40 - oh my God I'm losing my mind okay so
05:42 - let's uh let's try to get some code here
05:43 - in the same window that you can see I'm
05:45 - going to use some line breaks here I'm
05:47 - going to bring this down here just so
05:51 - you can I I'm obsessed with getting
05:52 - things laid out nicely so you can see
05:54 - here I've there's a Dom element with two
05:57 - events a mouse over a mouse out over I
06:00 - changed the name to some to I changed
06:01 - the text to this out I Chang the text to
06:04 - this so let's zoom in on the browser and
06:07 - if I mouse that didn't work Mouse over
06:10 - Mouse out oh is that the right paragraph
06:13 - name yeah it is what am I doing wrong
06:15 - somebody help me out here uh name p your
06:19 - name wait type your name oh you know why
06:22 - it's not working so this is kind of an
06:24 - important thing it's good to have these
06:26 - mistakes my hair is messed up this is a
06:29 - bit of a crazy video uh but it's uh if
06:31 - you're if you're watching I thank you
06:33 - but so it's good to have these mistakes
06:34 - like what's going on here why is that
06:35 - not working well you can make events and
06:39 - those events can happen but if there's
06:40 - something else in your code that's also
06:42 - happening it can easily override those
06:44 - events and I I made a sort of classic
06:46 - error of forgetting about this draw Loop
06:48 - so what's in the draw Loop name p. HTML
06:51 - that's happening always always always
06:53 - always always always always always
06:55 - always so it doesn't matter if this
06:56 - momentary event is executed instantly as
06:59 - draws looping it will override that by
07:01 - changing the text back to the text input
07:03 - so let me comment this
07:04 - out and now I can run this again and we
07:08 - can see my mouse over and mouse out
07:11 - Mouse over Mouse out Mouse over Mouse
07:13 - out so this is how these are just more
07:16 - events right there's the button event
07:18 - Mouse pressed there's the mouse over
07:20 - Mouse out event I could actually attach
07:21 - a mouse click event for when I click on
07:23 - the paragraph it's a little bit awkward
07:24 - because it's not really like a clickable
07:26 - thing so that is one nice that's another
07:29 - event that you can look at for
07:30 - incidentally you know I could attach
07:34 - that same
07:36 - event to the
07:39 - canvas oops
07:41 - ah um right I any
07:48 - element uh out per and then look at this
07:51 - I could say canvas. mous pressed change
07:54 - color so all of those those same events
07:57 - right the thing that happens when I
07:59 - Mouse over the paragraph also happens
08:02 - when I Mouse over the canvas the thing
08:04 - that happens when I click on this button
08:07 - also happens now when I click on the
08:08 - canvas but not when I click over here
08:10 - and not when I click in here so this is
08:13 - an interesting you can see these
08:14 - functions can be attaches events to
08:16 - multiple elements so there's so many
08:18 - possibilities here now I want to look at
08:21 - a this is enough for you to just mess
08:23 - around with now that you have Mouse
08:25 - press Mouse over and mouse out but I
08:27 - also want to look at these events which
08:30 - are a little bit strange the changed
08:32 - event the input event so let's think
08:36 - about this why do those events exist and
08:39 - why do you the person who is watching
08:41 - this video need those
08:44 - events what I need now is some lunch I
08:47 - think fading fading
08:49 - fast I'm going to make it through this
08:51 - video okay
08:53 - um changed that input so let's let's
08:56 - think about the slider let's think about
08:58 - the text input put
09:01 - box the input
09:04 - box I think I'm drawing what I just
09:07 - erased the
09:09 - slider how did we use those elements
09:12 - before there was a
09:15 - canvas and the canvas had things on it
09:19 - and there was there is there was there
09:22 - always has been there will be a draw
09:24 - function and the draw function is
09:26 - looping over and over forever and ever
09:28 - and ever so if I
09:31 - use the slider's
09:34 - value or the input's value in draw I'm
09:39 - always accessing that value continuously
09:41 - so if it Chang the stuff in draw we'll
09:43 - use the changed value of the slider but
09:46 - what if I want an action to only
09:49 - happen when I move the slider not when
09:53 - the slider's just sitting there only
09:55 - when I move it what if I want an action
09:57 - to happen when I only when I move the
09:59 - slider and then release the mouse or
10:01 - what if I want an action to happen
10:03 - anytime I type in here or anytime I T
10:06 - not anytime I type it but when I hit the
10:08 - enter key that's what changed and input
10:12 - the those two events
10:14 - do I just realized something that I
10:17 - might be in my code using an older
10:20 - version of the Dom Library so this input
10:22 - I might have to like pause for a second
10:24 - but it's fine you I'm going to edit I'll
10:26 - edit it'll be fine nothing bad will
10:27 - happen um
10:30 - erase what I just said for a second out
10:32 - of your mind and let's come back to this
10:34 - question these are two events the lingo
10:37 - of these events is a little bit strange
10:38 - and possibly not the most intuitive but
10:41 - there's two different events there's
10:43 - anytime it changes the value of this
10:45 - changes ever so slightly or there's any
10:47 - time I finish my action of changing the
10:49 - value that's the difference between just
10:52 - moving the slider all the continuously
10:55 - versus moving the slider and releasing
10:57 - the mouse finishing moving the slider or
10:59 - any time I type versus hitting the enter
11:01 - key so the changed event is for
11:04 - finishing your action the input event is
11:08 - for any change to that the value of that
11:11 - Dom element so let's come back here and
11:13 - take a look at that
11:15 - so let's um I've kind of mix and matched
11:19 - so many things here but what I want to
11:22 - do here is comment out the actually no I
11:26 - can leave so I can leave all of this
11:28 - sorry what I want to do this is still
11:30 - working but what I want to do now is
11:32 - when I type in my name and I hit enter I
11:36 - want to see sorry it's very hard for you
11:38 - to see that when I type in my name and
11:40 - when I hit enter I want to see that
11:42 - content
11:43 - change so what is the event for that
11:46 - input.
11:49 - changed and now I need a function to
11:51 - handle that uh you know
11:55 - update update
11:57 - text so what I can do here is I can say
12:01 - function update
12:03 - text and say name
12:06 - p.
12:08 - HTML
12:10 - input. value so now the text inside this
12:15 - paragraph right this paragraph is is
12:18 - name p so the text inside this paragraph
12:22 - is changing when I Mouse over when I
12:27 - Mouse over or Mouse out and now it's
12:29 - also changing if I hit the enter key
12:32 - right or tab actually will trigger this
12:34 - event so let's see if that works I'm
12:38 - going to type my name Daniel nobody ever
12:40 - calls me that but that is my name and
12:42 - hit enter and you can see look at that
12:44 - magically it updates now look at this
12:46 - those other events are still
12:48 - triggering and I could type you know my
12:50 - uh Fred Flintstone
12:53 - Flintstone right and you can see Fred
12:56 - Flintstone um so now the that's yet
12:59 - another event that you can handle and
13:03 - and and the um and so
13:06 - um let's see okay so I think the input
13:08 - so this is a good lesson to learn
13:10 - actually that the mistakes should just
13:12 - be in these videos and and you know I'm
13:13 - going to fix it all on the Fly not even
13:15 - going to edit it it's going to be fine
13:17 - I'm at 13 minutes nobody's watching
13:19 - anymore uh you know I should like say
13:22 - like a secret phrase you could email me
13:24 - or tweet me that message if you're still
13:25 - watching I don't know what that' be Fred
13:26 - Flintstone I don't know I don't even I
13:29 - never even W I was not allowed to watch
13:30 - television as the children my parents
13:31 - are not watching this video I I I if I I
13:35 - I I I I I I would gamble a lot of money
13:37 - that they're not watching but um anyway
13:39 - I I don't know if it made me better or
13:40 - worse or what
13:42 - but okay um so let's now try to change
13:46 - let's now use instead of the changed
13:48 - event let's use the input
13:53 - event input now I think I'm going to get
13:56 - an
13:57 - error look at this
13:59 - uncaught type error undefined is not a
14:03 - function now it's on line 26 oh my
14:06 - goodness first of all I created this
14:09 - like crazy circular thing where I have
14:11 - an in a variable name input and a
14:12 - function name input that's actually okay
14:15 - I don't really like it I kind of like it
14:16 - kind of makes me want to change this to
14:18 - like name
14:20 - input so at least I don't get
14:23 - confused uh right name input and then
14:26 - I'm going to change
14:29 - uh here name input uh everywhere I put
14:33 - it so many places um uh but
14:38 - um but but but there
14:42 - was a problem ah here name input let's
14:46 - come back to that
14:49 - problem undefined is not a function
14:51 - we're still at the problem the reason
14:52 - that that doesn't exist is not because
14:54 - of any other reason other than the input
14:57 - event was something that was recently
14:59 - added to the P5 D.J the P5 Dom library
15:03 - and I didn't when I made a P5 default
15:05 - project out of this editor the updated
15:07 - version of the library uh wasn't ready
15:09 - so you know what I could stop now and
15:11 - re-record this or fix it but and I'm
15:13 - going to kind of dig into the guts of
15:14 - this in a sort of a weird way but then
15:16 - kind of at 15 minutes you can stop
15:18 - watching this and and just go and get
15:20 - the more recent version of the library
15:21 - yourself but let's look at how I might
15:22 - fix this so number one is let's go to
15:27 - the p5.js or website and I'm going to
15:30 - click on
15:31 - download now what I want to I'm going to
15:33 - download uh p5js
15:37 - complete and I'm going to look for that
15:40 - file and get the folder and you can see
15:43 - if you download that there's a lot of
15:45 - stuff in that folder this is the most
15:47 - recent version of the p5js library this
15:50 - is a minified version of the library
15:51 - which is kind of an interesting thing uh
15:54 - you know a smaller version U the code is
15:57 - condensed but it's not as readable you
15:59 - might want to use that for various
16:01 - reasons that's another topic another
16:03 - time what I'm looking for is this
16:07 - p5.js I want to get this more recent
16:10 - version of the Dom Library so I'm going
16:12 - to hit command C which I'm copying that
16:15 - file and I'm going to go back to p5js
16:18 - the project and I'm going to do view
16:21 - show sketch folder so that I can look at
16:24 - it in my finder window and now I'm in
16:28 - this project other events there's a
16:30 - libraries folder which has those files
16:33 - in it I want to paste the new version of
16:35 - the library in
16:37 - here and I want to replace it yes I do
16:42 - and now I'm going to go back up you know
16:44 - I kind of said now it's telling me Oh My
16:46 - Goodness something horrible has happened
16:48 - you made some changes to some files I
16:51 - don't know what's going on reload you
16:52 - will lose any changes I probably
16:55 - shouldn't have done that changed the
16:57 - file system while the editor was open at
16:59 - the same time I might complain to the
17:01 - editor and say you know what I didn't
17:03 - change sketch. JS so you shouldn't
17:05 - really be telling me this I just changed
17:06 - a library file I don't even have open
17:08 - and maybe that's a bug that we can file
17:10 - that that some that I can remember to
17:11 - file or somebody watching this video can
17:13 - file in the p5js editor
17:16 - repository click okay uh so I'm kind of
17:19 - reloading that which is fine um and now
17:22 - I'm going to run it
17:23 - again and I still got undefined is not a
17:27 - function on line 26 six ah uh yeah I
17:31 - think that's right let's so let's let me
17:33 - be a bit more methodical let me get the
17:35 - most recent p5js as
17:38 - well and uh let me go back to the sketch
17:42 - folder and in libraries and add that as
17:45 - well oops I'm going to delete this one
17:48 - and this is the new one let me make sure
17:51 - that wasn't the
17:53 - problem uh what am I missing
17:57 - now okay
17:59 - boy this video is a total failure I
18:01 - should come back and just re-record it
18:02 - later uh it's like 18 minutes long uh
18:05 - maybe somebody in the chat is like
18:07 - looking at me and telling me what I last
18:09 - line has in uh um last line has input.
18:13 - value did I did I missed something
18:15 - update text okay
18:18 - let's uh yeah oh is
18:22 - that that's definitely a problem is that
18:25 - the problem no but that's not line 26 if
18:28 - I comment this
18:30 - out name input is not
18:33 - defined uh I spelled it wrong somewhere
18:36 - in line
18:40 - 51 yeah it's
18:42 - working
18:44 - um all right so you know what this is uh
18:46 - I'm going to actually
18:49 - um I want okay well I'm Gonna Keep I'm
18:52 - not stopping this I'm G to fix this in
18:54 - this video I could I could you know
18:56 - could get edited later I'm going to look
18:57 - in the reference
18:59 - let's see what happens and actually what
19:01 - I want to do is go under libraries and
19:03 - P5 Dom I wonder if that wasn't actually
19:07 - the most recent recent version that
19:09 - doesn't make any sense though um and uh
19:13 - look for uh events
19:16 - input the input function is called when
19:18 - any user input is detected on an element
19:20 - the input function is often used to
19:22 - detect keystrokes so this should be
19:23 - right what did I I wonder if did I do
19:27 - something wrong let's look at this again
19:28 - name input that's the element input
19:31 - update text undefined is not a function
