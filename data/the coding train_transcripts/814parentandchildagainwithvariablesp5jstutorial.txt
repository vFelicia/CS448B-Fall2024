00:00 - in this video I want to look again at
00:03 - the parent-child function so it's a bit
00:06 - of a review of that function but I want
00:07 - to look at it in a slightly different
00:08 - context before the main reason that I
00:13 - looked at the parent function was to
00:15 - take a Dom element that I generated in
00:18 - code and insert it into another place in
00:21 - sort of the existing HTML so we just
00:24 - find and and to do that you just you
00:26 - reference the ID of an HTML element here
00:29 - I want to look at how do you use the
00:30 - parent-child function with elements that
00:32 - you've generated in code which is
00:34 - ultimately the same thing but it's
00:35 - another chance to look at it and just
00:37 - also it's to make the point by the way
00:39 - the thing you can pass into that parent
00:41 - or child function is a p5 variable that
00:44 - has a reference to a Dom element so that
00:45 - explanation may not have made any sense
00:47 - let's look at an example that I've
00:49 - started to get some context here so
00:52 - actually let's just look at so what's
00:54 - going to be this is by the way the HTML
00:56 - file is empty so everything in this
00:58 - example I'm generating through code so
01:00 - first I made a pet make a paragraph that
01:02 - says this is a link it has a little gray
01:04 - background and a little bit of padding
01:05 - then I make a link and anchor tag with
01:08 - the word apples and I'm handling if you
01:10 - click on that tag with an event called
01:13 - add photo and that add photo function
01:17 - generates a image element boy a lot of
01:20 - stuff going on there so right first we
01:23 - have the paragraph element that's made
01:25 - here then I have the link element that's
01:27 - made here and when I click on that link
01:30 - an image appears which has happens down
01:34 - here image create image now this is
01:36 - important this is different than load
01:38 - image I'm looking where am I looking at
01:40 - this is different than load image load
01:43 - image is something I looked at in
01:44 - previous videos where you load a file
01:46 - and then draw that file into your canvas
01:48 - here the create image function actually
01:54 - makes
01:59 - an image Dom element just like you might
02:03 - type in HTML image source equals and
02:06 - this source equals could be the name of
02:08 - the image file or it could actually be a
02:10 - full URL to another image so this is a
02:13 - way of inserting an image as its own Dom
02:15 - element separate from drawing an image
02:17 - to the canvas on the page that's kind of
02:18 - an interesting topic of how you might do
02:21 - things with that in for another time but
02:23 - here just showing you yet another create
02:25 - function another HTML tag the image tag
02:28 - source being the attribute what is that
02:31 - images source and over here so we can
02:35 - see the result of all of this again I'm
02:38 - gonna look at the output here
02:40 - click-click-click so what I want to see
02:43 - happen is I want this beautiful grey
02:47 - padded box I want the link to the apples
02:50 - the apples clicking thing to be in that
02:52 - box and I want those apples to get
02:55 - inserted also in that box I want
02:57 - everything to be in that box so here we
03:00 - look at and say P is the object that is
03:04 - the paragraph a is the object the Dom
03:07 - element object which is actually a p5
03:09 - element object a is the link and image
03:12 - is the image so if I wanted a to go into
03:17 - P and this by the way I get this
03:19 - confused all the time which one is it a
03:21 - dot parent P or is it P dot parent a you
03:27 - could make a case for both of the hoes
03:29 - right you could make a case for it you
03:32 - want a to be parented by P or you want P
03:36 - to parent a which one was it
03:39 - I honestly can't remember cuz that I'm
03:41 - even like asking this question I
03:42 - confused myself so Mike let's go with my
03:45 - first instinct which is that I want a to
03:48 - have as its parent P the action is being
03:51 - applied to a and the action is make its
03:53 - parent P I'm pretty sure that's right
03:54 - and you can see there that worked so now
03:57 - the apples link is inside the paragraph
04:00 - so the difference is it appears up there
04:02 - rather there's a separate thing below
04:04 - and now when I click apples those images
04:06 - get added below which actually this may
04:08 - be a nice effect but what I could say
04:12 - is also like image dot parent P so now
04:17 - and I've got a problem again as soon as
04:19 - I do this what's wrong this is not a
04:22 - global variable so I don't have access
04:24 - to that variable scope down here so I'm
04:26 - gonna make that of global variable and
04:28 - I'm gonna say P equals create P and I'm
04:31 - gonna run this and now when I click
04:33 - apples those images are now also inside
04:36 - that paragraph element so this is just
04:39 - and incidentally let's just let's just
04:41 - remind ourselves I could have said P dot
04:44 - child image and this if my mind is
04:48 - working correctly these are identical
04:50 - I want image to be parented by the
04:54 - paragraph or I want the paragraph to
04:56 - child the image right so that's the
05:00 - action that's the way of thinking about
05:01 - it honestly a better way of thinking
05:03 - about it would be to look it up in the
05:04 - p5.js documentation I will clue a link
05:06 - to that below and I'm sure it will say
05:08 - it there but this is something that
05:09 - certainly does confuse me but in general
05:12 - I'd stick to the parent function and
05:15 - there you go so this is a scenario that
05:17 - you are looking at now I I want to look
05:20 - at this also because I think we could
05:22 - kind of raise the stakes here a little
05:24 - bit so this is probably a good place to
05:27 - stop watching this video but I'm gonna
05:29 - go on anyway and what I'm going to do is
05:33 - I'm going to make a whole lot of these
05:35 - like what if I make a whole bunch of
05:38 - these let's think about this for VAR I
05:41 - equals 0 I is less than 5 let's just do
05:46 - 5 right now I plus plus and I'm gonna
05:49 - put a loop around all of this code and I
05:52 - don't I don't want the global variable
05:54 - anymore and here I'm gonna comment this
05:58 - I'm going to comment out what's going on
05:59 - here so first I just want to see the
06:01 - result here so the nice thing that you
06:04 - can see here is this principle still
06:05 - applies right now
06:07 - we're making a paragraph a link link
06:10 - gets parented by the paragraph another
06:12 - paragraph a link link gets parented by
06:14 - that paragraph now for you I might say
06:16 - as an exercise could you make each one
06:18 - of these paragraphs have different
06:19 - content could you make one a link called
06:22 - apples and one include link called
06:24 - blueberries
06:25 - one link called bananas bananas
06:28 - depending on where you are in the world
06:32 - but so that might be something that you
06:34 - add yourself and maybe I'll work on that
06:36 - another time so but the point of this
06:38 - now is this is a nice opportunity for us
06:40 - to remind ourselves that now this add
06:43 - photo call back when it's triggered what
06:47 - if I want to do the same thing what if I
06:50 - want to get the images inside right when
06:53 - I click on this one the images should
06:55 - appear inside that one when I click on
06:57 - this one the images should be here
06:58 - inside that one this is a pretty tricky
07:01 - problem but it is doable and it uses
07:04 - something that you haven't used before
07:06 - that I'm excited to show you so let's
07:09 - see how we can make this work so the
07:11 - question is what do I put here
07:13 - so first let's ask the question what do
07:16 - I even have access to well I have access
07:20 - to the keyword this do you remember that
07:23 - keyword this what is this referring to
07:27 - it's referring to the Dom element that
07:31 - triggered the callback add photo the
07:33 - specific one a so the link so this would
07:38 - be parenting the image by the link and
07:40 - we could do that and let's run that
07:43 - let's see if that at least gives us
07:44 - something so that actually is working
07:46 - the weird thing is this is actually part
07:48 - of the link which is kind of interesting
07:49 - effect all of these are as part of that
07:51 - same link I click on any of them I keep
07:52 - adding but I wanted them to be separate
07:54 - just insert it into the paragraph right
07:57 - so this works it's nice how could I get
08:01 - access to the paragraph okay let's let's
08:05 - make a diagram so over here let's think
08:10 - about what's actually on the page I have
08:14 - paragraph which has inside it an anchor
08:18 - followed by another paragraph which has
08:22 - inside it an anchor so what I previously
08:24 - just did is I took that image and
08:29 - inserted it the image of the Apple and
08:31 - inserted it as part of the anchor but
08:33 - what I want to do is I want to take that
08:37 - image
08:38 - and insert it as part of the paragraph
08:43 - paragraph is a child of body anchor is a
08:49 - child of paragraph and my new image I
08:53 - want to insert as a child of paragraph
08:57 - but the only thing I have is a reference
09:00 - is to this well what if I could
09:02 - reference this anchor tag and ask hey
09:05 - who's your parent who wears here it's
09:08 - like having you're at the playground and
09:09 - there's a child who's doing something
09:11 - and you say where sure you don't want to
09:13 - know about this but I spent a lot of
09:14 - time with my own children in the
09:15 - playground of this sort of like relates
09:16 - to it in a second but then it's like a
09:18 - weird thing that I'm talking about so
09:19 - back to this I want to know who's your
09:23 - parents a and so there's a way that p5
09:27 - will give you that right if I say parent
09:31 - with a argument I'm saying assign this
09:36 - elements parent to this other element if
09:39 - I say parent with no argument parent
09:42 - blank I'm asking p5 to tell me who the
09:46 - current parent is so look at this come
09:48 - back over here I can say now I can say
09:51 - var paragraph equals ma sorry this dot
09:56 - parent this is me asking this you're the
10:00 - anchor tag this anchor tag who is your
10:02 - parent Oh your parents is this paragraph
10:04 - great make the image part of that
10:07 - paragraph and I'm now going to run this
10:10 - and you can see - I mean it looks the
10:13 - same but this is no longer a link so
10:16 - it's now been parented by the paragraph
10:18 - and by the way so this is sort of the
10:21 - end of this except I actually have a
10:23 - couple things I want it's there's
10:24 - another thing I wanted to add to this
10:25 - which I think would be interesting oh I
10:27 - got this is great I'm gonna add
10:28 - something to this what I think would be
10:29 - interesting let's just do that now I
10:31 - have something else that I want to show
10:32 - you towards the end of this video
10:34 - already ten minutes in but there's a few
10:36 - this is this is going sort of well so
10:38 - I'm not ready to stop just yet
10:39 - so let's let's add I wouldn't want to
10:41 - add to this is something like okay so
10:43 - what I want to add and let's put this in
10:45 - the HTML file which has some extra style
10:50 - stuff that I'm not
10:50 - take that out let me add a button button
10:54 - ID equals clear clear and I'm say clear
10:58 - images so I want to add to the body of
11:02 - the page and I'll put it inside a
11:04 - paragraph just so it has some padding
11:07 - around it I want to add on to the page a
11:10 - button at the top and that button is
11:13 - clear images and when I press that
11:15 - button I want to remove all the images
11:17 - that have been added how do I do this
11:21 - now in theory you know there's a bunch
11:24 - of let's think about this for a second
11:26 - oh so there's an itch there's a there's
11:27 - actually a quick way that I could do
11:28 - this without even the way that I was
11:30 - thinking I was gonna do this so there's
11:31 - two different ways we can think about
11:32 - this number one is let's come back to
11:34 - this diagram now that this is working
11:36 - let's think about what we have a
11:39 - paragraph with an anchor inside it and
11:43 - an image and maybe another image right
11:45 - another paragraph with an anchor inside
11:48 - it and an image right we have a bunch of
11:51 - paragraph elements with things inside of
11:53 - it and I want to just how can I find all
11:55 - of the images on the page that's right
11:58 - give me all the images on the page well
12:01 - here's a way I could find all the images
12:04 - on the page you know about this because
12:06 - I did this in a previous video select
12:09 - all IMG select all IMG would suddenly
12:15 - give you an array of all the image
12:18 - elements anywhere on the page no matter
12:19 - where they are in that page so this is
12:21 - useful if I could get all those images
12:23 - elements maybe I could do something to
12:25 - remove them all for the page so while I
12:27 - could do it this way and I'll say you do
12:29 - it this way after you watch this video
12:30 - if you're falling along do it with
12:32 - select all as an exercise I'm gonna do a
12:34 - slightly different way because sometimes
12:37 - you might not be able to easily use
12:39 - select all and what you're doing what if
12:41 - instead you just kept your own array of
12:44 - Dom elements and this is not an uncommon
12:46 - practice actually I don't know what a
12:49 - common or uncommon practice is because I
12:51 - don't do any of this for real I'm just
12:53 - figuring it out and making videos about
12:54 - it so it's not an uncommon practice in
12:56 - my making video examples about it anyway
12:59 - so if I come back to the code I might
13:01 - save our images equals array
13:03 - so I'm creating a global variable that's
13:06 - an array where anytime I make one of
13:08 - these elements I'll store a version of
13:09 - it so I have this for myself and in that
13:13 - case anytime I make an image element I
13:16 - can say image dot push I'm sorry images
13:20 - dot push image so this is me adding that
13:25 - image object to this array which is a
13:27 - global variable so now anywhere in this
13:29 - code I have access to all of those image
13:33 - objects this can be very useful because
13:35 - for example I could I could do something
13:39 - I could remove oh I could remove them
13:40 - one at a time which would be kind of an
13:42 - interesting thing to do we could we
13:44 - could do that or I could remove them all
13:46 - at once I could apply a style to all of
13:48 - them let's look at just removing them
13:50 - all at once so albeit this is an array
13:52 - that I could fill would select all I'm
13:55 - making it myself so let's take a look at
13:58 - how I might do this so first of all
14:01 - what's on the page there's this button
14:03 - how do I get access to that button that
14:05 - button is made in the HTML file with an
14:08 - ID called clear so I just need to use
14:09 - select so I need to save our button
14:13 - equals select button oh no I called it
14:16 - clear and then I want to handle when
14:21 - it's pressed with I know clear stuff
14:24 - I'll write a function called clear stuff
14:27 - and here is where I can do a loop I
14:32 - already have that array that halls all
14:34 - the image objects in it for index I from
14:37 - 0 to the length of the array so for
14:39 - every single element in that array what
14:44 - was it called images length I plus plus
14:48 - now this images index I dot something so
14:54 - right here now I know it's showing me
14:55 - syntax errors but this is now me saying
14:57 - I whenever I made an image element I put
15:00 - it into that array hooray for me so now
15:03 - I have this like back it's like a back
15:04 - up it's like we're done didn't see like
15:05 - I just I'm making all these elements and
15:07 - in case I ever need to refer back to
15:08 - them I've got them all on this array
15:10 - sure I could get them with select all
15:11 - but I'm really cautious and worried
15:13 - about it I'm gonna make my own array
15:15 - so now I could apply a style to them I
15:17 - could change their source to show a
15:18 - different image but just to demonstrate
15:20 - removing stuff that's there's a p5 Dom
15:24 - library function called remove and
15:27 - remove does is actually removes it from
15:29 - the page which by the way is different
15:31 - than hide so I could use hide which is
15:35 - going to hide it make it so you don't
15:36 - see it but the element is still actually
15:38 - there as part of the sort of like active
15:41 - page it could show it again
15:42 - if I remove it it's gone it's deleted
15:45 - it's not coming back
15:46 - so let's not worry about hide so much
15:48 - right now let's add remove so all that
15:50 - I've done is now anytime I add one of
15:53 - these images all of those images
15:57 - wherever they've been added all of those
16:00 - images are now part of this array so now
16:04 - all I need to do when I hit clear is it
16:09 - will loop through the whole array and
16:10 - remove them all and there you go and now
16:12 - I can add some more again and I can hit
16:16 - clear and it works again now one thing I
16:19 - probably should do is once I've actually
16:21 - removed them
16:22 - I could probably reset the array back to
16:25 - blame worked anyway but I might want to
16:27 - just sort of like clear that array
16:28 - because I don't need references to those
16:30 - objects which have now since been
16:31 - removed so this is hopefully showing you
16:33 - a bit more of stuff that you can do this
16:36 - is calm showing you again just to sort
16:38 - of recap a little bit I can make stuff
16:40 - in the HTML file and access it through
16:43 - select by an ID like I did with that
16:44 - button I can make elements dynamically
16:47 - in a loop like I did with create P and
16:50 - then I could also make other elements
16:52 - parents after those elements have things
16:54 - inside then later I could make elements
16:56 - that are based on an event and I could
16:58 - know which Dom element triggered that
17:00 - event and then I could know what's the
17:02 - parent of that Dom element that
17:03 - triggered the event and put other things
17:05 - in that Dom element there's a lot of
17:07 - pieces to this example but hopefully
17:09 - this is showing you kind of a bit of the
17:10 - spectrum now of how you might write HTML
17:13 - write JavaScript to generate control
17:16 - style select select all that sort of
17:18 - thing I think I have two more videos
17:21 - that I want to make one is about how you
17:23 - might dragon
17:23 - drop a file into the browser and use the
17:26 - contents of that file and then I keep
17:28 - looking over here because I'm gonna at
17:29 - the time and then another video just to
17:32 - show you about sort of controlling
17:33 - interface elements kind of in a
17:35 - zombified way so they just like act on
17:37 - their own which i think is kind of
17:38 - interesting so that's the end of this
17:40 - particular rather long 17 minute video
17:42 - and i'll be back with another one
