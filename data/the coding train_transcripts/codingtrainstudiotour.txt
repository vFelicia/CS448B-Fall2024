00:02 - okay
00:03 - I think I am live
00:06 - I have no way of knowing other than that
00:08 - I see a live
00:10 - uh but it says live on my phone here but
00:14 - it doesn't show me that anybody's
00:15 - watching oh finish
00:17 - finish oh no no I don't want to stop
00:19 - that's if I want to stop ah somebody
00:21 - showed up
00:23 - okay so I'm here at New York University
00:25 - New York
00:27 - University uh and I've had a lot of
00:30 - requests let me know if those are you
00:31 - leaving messages if you can hear me okay
00:34 - um I've had a lot of requests to do a
00:36 - studio
00:37 - tour
00:39 - I'm sitting at the tissue of the Arts I
00:41 - think this floor is technically the
00:43 - skirball center for New Media and uh
00:47 - this is the view look it's kind of like
00:49 - a uh
00:50 - there's some sort of beautiful sunset
00:52 - Cloud action happening back there in New
00:54 - York City
00:55 - um and I'm going to flip the camera
00:58 - and I'm gonna walk down this hallway
01:01 - and into this room I'm gonna use my ID
01:04 - it's gonna open
01:06 - and then here we are so this is what is
01:10 - this is the room
01:13 - I don't know what else to do now okay
01:15 - let me let me put the camera on me yeah
01:17 - I hit the camera because I didn't want
01:18 - to like show other people who maybe
01:19 - didn't want to be live on uh on a live
01:22 - stream so here I am in the room uh where
01:25 - I record all of my videos and so what
01:27 - I'm going to do is I'm going to go
01:28 - through I'm going to actually record a
01:30 - couple videos in a moment but I'm going
01:32 - to go through
01:34 - uh it's quite small yes there's some
01:36 - filing okay wait hold on let me turn
01:38 - this around
01:39 - I'll show you some things first that are
01:40 - in the room and how it's set up it's a
01:42 - bit of a mess and then what I'm going to
01:44 - do is gonna I'm gonna go through and
01:47 - um I'm going to go through and sort of
01:49 - set up all the things I need to set up
01:51 - and then I'll switch to the actual
01:52 - recording system and live stream so
01:54 - first of all uh those of you who are
01:55 - interested in uh uh coding train
02:00 - merchandise here's some sample t-shirts
02:02 - that I have uh you can see let's see I'm
02:05 - gonna turn on some of these first of all
02:06 - here's the thermostat uh let's see maybe
02:08 - I can tell it to cool down in here turn
02:12 - that on to 90 minutes
02:13 - uh uh okay I am going to
02:17 - uh turn on this light
02:20 - to make things brighter there's a button
02:22 - here oh it's not plugged in I forgot I
02:23 - have some things unplugged
02:25 - this is really riveting
02:27 - uh uh okay so I'm going to plug in some
02:31 - of these lights
02:33 - uh and then this light is on this is the
02:35 - camera so this is the this is a Mark 3
02:37 - camera you can see it has HDMI out which
02:40 - I am getting here uh and that camera is
02:43 - pointed at this particular whiteboard
02:45 - and the Whiteboard is in fact painted
02:47 - onto the wall so this is the uh
02:50 - whiteboard paint over here that was used
02:54 - to paint onto the wall okay now so
02:59 - that's that's this side of the room
03:00 - camera light now I don't actually have
03:03 - the lights pointed towards the
03:04 - Whiteboard unfortunately because it's
03:06 - somebody warned me about this this
03:08 - whiteboard is very very very reflective
03:11 - so uh it it's um so that didn't really
03:15 - work unfortunately okay now over here
03:18 - this is the table that I stand behind it
03:22 - is a kind of standing desk Contraption
03:24 - it has this uh button on it yeah
03:28 - we can move up and down
03:29 - [Music]
03:30 - uh and then you'll if you're wondering
03:33 - first of all there's your live chat I
03:35 - think is this oh no this is probably a
03:36 - live chat with something else
03:38 - um this is the computer my my uh monitor
03:41 - which I use to sort of see what
03:43 - everything looks like so let me uh I
03:45 - have to figure out let's see hold on
03:47 - let's see what I can do I am going to
03:49 - put my phone right here on my laptop for
03:52 - a second and I'm going to start turning
03:54 - some things on
03:56 - um okay so I got to uh
04:00 - I am going to log out of here
04:05 - uh I don't know what I'm doing here
04:07 - leave
04:09 - uh I am going to
04:12 - uh um
04:16 - so what I'm doing right now is I am
04:18 - getting my computer
04:20 - set up to uh live stream so and I
04:24 - shrived on this in advance and I can see
04:25 - that I can see people sending me message
04:27 - I need extra haircut yeah oh I really
04:29 - should have gone to like get a haircut
04:31 - and trim the before I this was a bad
04:33 - idea to do this studio walkthrough
04:34 - you're getting a much more close-up view
04:36 - of my
04:39 - very not so nicely manicure itself okay
04:44 - um here we go okay
04:47 - um
04:48 - okay so now you can see here uh this is
04:50 - the
04:51 - that I use
04:53 - uh and
04:55 - um it is currently not plugged it's this
04:57 - is just it right here that's the screen
04:58 - that you usually see but what it needs
05:01 - is it needs to be plugged in to the
05:04 - capture system so I'm looking for
05:09 - this particular cable
05:10 - this is
05:13 - gonna plug it in
05:16 - once that happens
05:19 - resolution changes and I look over here
05:21 - now look over here on my monitor oops my
05:23 - fingers in front of the camera point
05:25 - which is not very good production value
05:27 - I figured by the camera again okay uh
05:30 - this is my uh monitor that I look at to
05:33 - the side there's my random digits book
05:35 - with a train whistle and you'll notice
05:37 - there's a big black Square there so why
05:39 - is there a big black square is because
05:41 - that is the uh rectangle so to speak
05:44 - that uh is the place for the the image
05:47 - that this camera sees so I'm going to
05:49 - turn this camera on
05:51 - and now as I walk back over here you
05:55 - will see that there I am live keyed uh
05:59 - with the green screen behind me and the
06:00 - monitor so this software that you're
06:01 - looking at is called wirecast
06:03 - and uh there's an open source it's a
06:06 - it's a broadcasting it's made by
06:07 - telestream it's broadcasting software
06:10 - and
06:11 - um there's an open source uh free uh
06:14 - equivalent called open broadcast studio
06:16 - and I'm thinking of switching over to
06:19 - that
06:20 - um just to use something that's open
06:22 - source I think it's open source
06:24 - um but wirecast is pretty great I have
06:26 - enjoyed using it I best had some issues
06:28 - this morning where it was crashing but a
06:30 - couple things that a wirecast allows me
06:31 - to do if I turn on this other camera
06:35 - uh turn on this other camera
06:38 - oops am I pressing the wrong buttons
06:41 - oh you know what maybe it's not plugged
06:42 - in
06:46 - let's see here whoops
06:49 - press this button no why is this camera
06:51 - not turning on oh okay hold on
06:54 - Hardware oh Hardware debugging session
06:56 - is a terrible idea hoop this looks like
06:59 - this cable goes to here ah it got loose
07:02 - Maybe
07:04 - all right I'm gonna have to hold on I'm
07:06 - gonna I don't know what you should look
07:07 - at right now uh
07:11 - I gotta put my phone down for a second
07:13 - to uh test this okay let me uh let me
07:16 - put it here
07:18 - and do this
07:19 - okay hold on a second I am going to go
07:23 - down I can you hear me I am going to go
07:27 - over there to check to see if the cable
07:30 - is plugged in I do need this camera to
07:32 - work to make videos okay uh
07:37 - so here it is
07:43 - but I've never had this problem did I
07:45 - unplug something unwittingly
07:47 - one thing that I could really use is
07:49 - like cleaning up all these cables aha
07:52 - the reason the camera is not turning on
07:54 - is this this must go into an outlet
08:00 - okay
08:02 - I'm going to plug it in now I'll be
08:04 - right back
08:08 - uh now plug that in and
08:11 - now this needs a different plug which is
08:15 - here
08:17 - and now
08:19 - magic of magic this camera I believe ah
08:22 - it turned on
08:24 - and so now
08:26 - uh here we go
08:28 - uh camera which is pointed at this
08:34 - whiteboard
08:36 - is now I can see it there as shot number
08:40 - two so uh basically the way that I
08:45 - switch while I'm live streaming between
08:46 - shots
08:48 - switch this back here the way that I
08:51 - switch between live stream within shots
08:52 - is
08:54 - I have them mapped to key strokes so if
08:57 - I press one
09:00 - then that's what I see if I press two
09:02 - then that's what I see that's what I'm
09:03 - so I can live switch between the two
09:05 - views and I can also press three
09:09 - which goes to this ridiculous video so
09:12 - uh whiteboard
09:13 - uh camera and laptop and a ridiculous
09:17 - video so I really only have three shots
09:19 - I also have another shot which is just
09:21 - yeah that's it oh I actually have this
09:23 - um which I don't have a key map to it
09:25 - but that is just a shot that shows
09:27 - exactly what the
09:29 - uh camera is seeing so there's my random
09:32 - digits here's my train whistle
09:36 - [Applause]
09:38 - and uh yeah at one point I actually had
09:41 - oh and like a big red button it wasn't
09:44 - that big and that was like much more fun
09:45 - to use but then I realized I could just
09:48 - use a keyboard and so that's what I uh
09:50 - switch I prefer a Blackboard no
09:53 - Blackboard ah the chalk on the
09:55 - Blackboard ah it gives me the like
09:57 - tingly wiggly wiggly uncomfortable
09:59 - feelings so I much prefer a whiteboard
10:01 - uh what else are in the show okay so a
10:02 - couple things so all of this stuff how's
10:04 - this working like what computer is
10:06 - running this
10:07 - so um the computer is on the
10:11 - back uh Tower and you'll notice all the
10:15 - inputs running into it so all of these
10:17 - are all those camera inputs this is for
10:19 - ethernet
10:21 - um this I believe is the microphone uh
10:23 - I'll share that in a second uh though
10:25 - maybe this is the microphone I know what
10:26 - this is oh it's just the keyboard
10:27 - probably so everything runs into this
10:29 - Mac Tower and then that's the this is
10:31 - the streaming computer
10:34 - um and so one thing I need to show is so
10:36 - here's one of the cameras for example
10:38 - coming out of the camera is this HDMI
10:41 - cable so the cable comes all the way out
10:43 - this cable doesn't go directly into the
10:45 - tower it goes into this particular box
10:48 - which is called I think it's like a
10:50 - black magic intensity extreme so you can
10:52 - see it's HDMI in and then Thunderbolt
10:55 - out so this is necessary because it's
10:58 - not natively a captured
11:00 - um oops uh it's not natively a capture
11:03 - device and there's one of my lights so
11:04 - let's turn on this light
11:07 - this is another light I will turn it on
11:09 - it does makes the keying much better
11:12 - um
11:13 - so there we go I turned on this light
11:15 - and now
11:17 - that's this light with like a soft box
11:19 - so I I could really use one thing I
11:22 - really want to do is um get a little bit
11:24 - of a grid going in here with more light
11:26 - so the lighting is a bit more from above
11:28 - uh
11:29 - what else do I have to show you I have
11:32 - some I I rated my kids uh train toy uh
11:36 - bin at home and brought some Train toys
11:38 - in thinking I would use them as props
11:40 - I haven't figured that out
11:42 - uh yet how to do that let's see what
11:44 - else is in here uh lights I showed you
11:46 - the shirts that I'm putting on making
11:50 - available
11:52 - um and okay so other things
11:54 - um
11:56 - um all of this stuff
11:59 - here is oh this is
12:02 - um this is the uh lav mic this is what's
12:05 - going into the computer with a little
12:08 - antenna here
12:10 - um and I have two bars of battery left
12:12 - so I oh it does say low battery is on so
12:15 - I might switch the batteries before I
12:16 - start and then that connects to
12:20 - uh this particular microphone so this is
12:23 - the microphone that I uh
12:28 - use to
12:31 - um attach to myself and talk into so now
12:33 - you can see that it's on over there
12:35 - you'll see green on the right so I can
12:38 - tell that the mic is working and then
12:40 - the other thing that I sometimes do for
12:43 - sound effects is laptop here
12:47 - uh
12:50 - this output which goes through a magic a
12:53 - black magic box into the computer I can
12:55 - actually send audio out of that as well
12:57 - so I capture that audio into wirecast so
12:59 - any audio playing out of this laptop
13:01 - also appears so I don't know how to
13:04 - demonstrate that super easily but so
13:05 - then I do a weird thing which is that I
13:07 - AirPlay an iPad to get audio from like a
13:11 - soundboard on an iPad but I really want
13:13 - to redo that system it's not working
13:14 - very well for me
13:15 - um but I can't believe that there's 745
13:18 - people watching this right now I'm about
13:20 - to switch over I think I'm I've done all
13:22 - the setup stuff I'm about to switch over
13:23 - to do an actual tutorial this was just a
13:25 - little bit of a preview people have been
13:26 - asking about a walkthrough of the studio
13:28 - uh I can see chat comments here maybe I
13:32 - can kind of take a few questions about
13:33 - what's going on in here so if you guys
13:36 - could
13:39 - um kind of um
13:40 - limit your questions to questions
13:42 - related to the studio
13:46 - have I ever thought about doing a live
13:48 - show yes
13:50 - uh
13:52 - clean your whiteboard I really need to
13:54 - clean the Whiteboard why oh the camera
13:56 - and the pressing the button
13:58 - uh the camera is top switching the the
14:01 - camera and the pressing the button I
14:02 - will the issue with these cameras is and
14:05 - I probably should just use different
14:06 - Mark 3 5D cameras you know the things I
14:10 - like about them is I can put a custom
14:12 - lens on it I can have a you know Focus
14:14 - they're good quality there's lots of
14:15 - good things about them they also
14:17 - natively do HDMI out the Mark III the
14:19 - Mark II does not so I just get a nice
14:21 - clean output the problem is and
14:22 - apparently
14:24 - um this is yeah so I what I need to do
14:27 - is install the Magic Lantern firmware
14:29 - but I'm a little bit afraid of breaking
14:31 - the cameras so I just kind of haven't
14:33 - gotten around to doing that these
14:35 - cameras are you know technically used
14:37 - for other things as well so these aren't
14:39 - my personal cameras they're you know
14:41 - borrowed
14:43 - um
14:44 - um oh yeah how much how much are those
14:47 - lights from the third yeah there's the
14:49 - lights aren't that close to the
14:50 - thermostat there is a light
14:52 - there and there's the thermostat on it
14:55 - um so I but the room does kind of heat
14:57 - up and um in theory I should be getting
14:59 - air from up there but I haven't really
15:01 - noticed that okay what button do you
15:02 - press when you switch between the
15:03 - Whiteboard and the green background so I
15:05 - showed that previously already but just
15:07 - to show you again
15:08 - um I just use keyboard shortcuts uh and
15:11 - then I can switch and you can see it on
15:12 - my monitor over here so that's why I'm
15:14 - kind of often oops my computer went to
15:17 - sleep that's why I'm often over here
15:18 - doing this uh whoops you can't see I'm
15:20 - doing this like I'm pretending that I'm
15:23 - referencing things where really all I'm
15:24 - doing is my hand is by the Whiteboard
15:27 - um and I I what I really want to do is
15:29 - install a big giant monitor up there
15:32 - behind the camera because what I would
15:34 - like to be able to do is read the
15:37 - um like sort of see a live chat uh
15:41 - um sort of see a live chat while I'm
15:43 - looking forward as opposed to looking to
15:45 - the side you can see this is the chat
15:46 - that I look at during the live stream I
15:49 - also have a second laptop which I'm not
15:51 - going to open right now but I have a
15:52 - secondary a laptop over here which I use
15:55 - to
15:57 - um kind of monitor uh the stream and
15:59 - that sort of thing
16:01 - uh okay
16:04 - hold on let's see what else
16:09 - why do I use a Mac that's what I have
16:12 - any specific reason why you use a Mac
16:14 - Pro it's what I had access to
16:17 - um ah have I thought about using a light
16:19 - board yes so I have this idea I've had
16:23 - this idea and I haven't really had the
16:25 - time to sort of think about it but
16:27 - um I uh I have this idea to uh
16:33 - have a glass pane or like right here
16:36 - between me and the camera so I could
16:39 - draw on it and it would be in front of
16:40 - me and see through as opposed to uh the
16:44 - white that is behind me so yes I have
16:46 - thought about that okay I think what
16:48 - time is it I have no idea uh yeah so
16:52 - this studio is at New York University I
16:54 - I work here at New York University full
16:56 - time this is actually like on a quick uh
16:58 - storage closet it's a big storage closet
17:00 - you'll notice that these are there's
17:02 - some filing
17:03 - I don't know what's in the filing
17:04 - cabinet it's the mystery it's a mystery
17:06 - to me but they are in here there are
17:08 - filing cabinets
17:11 - uh okay
17:13 - um
17:15 - thank you everybody for watching this um
17:18 - I I can do a more thoughtful version of
17:19 - this another time if um do I look better
17:22 - if I put the camera higher
17:24 - uh and but I think I should get going
17:28 - with doing some actual tutorials so
17:31 - eight all 814 of you apparently who are
17:33 - watching which is nuts which is now 805.
17:38 - um uh oh I should create a this dot
17:42 - shirt that's a great suggestion
17:45 - um that's a great suggestion I should
17:47 - create a Vista shirt and maybe I'll do
17:50 - that um as a kind of limited special run
17:52 - maybe I can do it as a fundraiser for a
17:54 - good uh coding cause
17:57 - um so uh I'm going to turn off my phone
18:01 - which will turn off this live stream and
18:04 - then I'm immediately not immediately but
18:07 - about five minutes
18:09 - I am going to a switch and press this
18:13 - button up here which will turn on my
18:15 - stream and also record a backup and that
18:18 - will send out what you're seeing here
18:20 - straight to YouTube
18:23 - um
18:23 - someone asked when I'm gonna have a
18:25 - people are asking about the name of the
18:27 - channel I guess I'll since this is like
18:28 - a just sort of arbitrary let me just um
18:31 - give the sh the short version of this
18:34 - story so I called the Channel coding
18:36 - rainbow at one point because I love an
18:38 - old show called Reading Rainbow and I
18:40 - love the idea of rainbow as a friendly
18:43 - welcoming symbol
18:45 - um
18:46 - and Reading Rainbow is one of my
18:48 - favorite uh well it's a program that I a
18:51 - television program that I loved PBS uh
18:53 - program here in the United States about
18:55 - reading and literacy with a wonderful
18:56 - host named Levar Britain
18:59 - um so I kind of didn't really think that
19:01 - I was doing a thing because I was just
19:03 - kind of making videos and I called it a
19:05 - coding rainbow
19:06 - um as a sort of idea
19:09 - um informally and then I went a little
19:11 - bit too far with it and I think that I
19:13 - started doing this more as a regular
19:14 - thing and um unfortunately the you know
19:17 - rightly so the logo and uh was too close
19:20 - to Reading Rainbow and it was confusing
19:23 - and a bit of a trademark issue so I
19:27 - decided
19:28 - um uh uh to change the name
19:30 - um and the um I went through a lot of
19:33 - different options and coding train
19:34 - trainbow seemed like a good idea at the
19:37 - time and so that's what I went with
19:40 - um as a new name so maybe next year I'll
19:42 - change the name again but there will be
19:43 - there was a coding Rainbow song a music
19:45 - video and there still is that music
19:47 - video in song but it's all been redacted
19:49 - uh and blurred and some of the lyrics
19:51 - taken out so
19:53 - um I am working on a new one with the
19:56 - same composer Adam Blau uh and hope to
20:00 - have a new video as well so
20:04 - um why do I stream on YouTube not twitch
20:06 - I don't maybe I should stream on Twitch
20:08 - YouTube has just been the platform that
20:10 - I started you I used to have all my
20:11 - videos on Vimeo and I uploaded a few to
20:13 - YouTube I think it was maybe a year and
20:15 - a half ago and I just discovered there
20:17 - was a new audience for it there and I
20:19 - used to stream both to Twitch and
20:20 - YouTube but I never really caught on and
20:22 - sometimes the chat and twitch was a
20:23 - little bit you know sometimes the chat
20:26 - and YouTube isn't as friendly as it
20:28 - could be but in uh the chat and twitch
20:30 - was um there was a little bit more of a
20:32 - kind of mean-spirited energy I'm sure
20:34 - there's plenty of twitch channels and
20:35 - chats that are lovely somehow I just
20:37 - didn't like catch on anyway
20:39 - um
20:39 - so I am going to uh turn this off I do
20:45 - teach uh full-time at uh New York
