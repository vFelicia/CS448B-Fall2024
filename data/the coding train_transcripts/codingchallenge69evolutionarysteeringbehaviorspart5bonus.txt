00:00 - hello bonus part 5 you don't have to
00:02 - really be watching this video I finished
00:04 - in the last one but I was going to add
00:06 - this I'm going to record a video of the
00:07 - adding it because why not
00:09 - right so I just want to add one little
00:10 - interface element to this you should add
00:13 - more interface elements and what I'm
00:14 - going to add is a checkbox to turn the
00:16 - debugging stuff on and off so how do I
00:18 - do that there's a bunch of different
00:20 - ways I could do this what I'm going to
00:22 - do is I'm going to use the p5 Dom
00:23 - library and I'm going to say I'm going
00:26 - to create a variable called debug and
00:28 - I'm going to say debug equals create
00:33 - checkbox I think it's the function let's
00:36 - just see let's just see I'm going to run
00:37 - this refresh it look at that
00:39 - so now there's a little checkbox check
00:40 - check check check so the p5 Dom library
00:43 - allows you to just generate Dom elements
00:45 - on the fly and it adds them directly to
00:47 - the page now I have a whole set of Dom
00:49 - tutorial videos that I will link to
00:51 - because there's a lot of other interface
00:53 - elements you can imagine adding to this
00:54 - that allow you to control various
00:55 - parameters I'm just adding the debug
00:57 - checkbox okay so now that I have this I
01:01 - can say okay this is so it'd be this
01:04 - sure my world record for shortest video
01:05 - ever and I know I'll ruin it by talking
01:07 - for way too much but right here in the
01:10 - vehicles display function this is where
01:14 - I draw the debugging information so
01:16 - guess what let's let me just go here to
01:18 - the console if I type in debug we can
01:22 - see it's a p5 element and if I say debug
01:25 - dot checked checked its false now if I
01:32 - check it and say debug checked its true
01:35 - is so easy
01:36 - wow what a nice fun little thing to
01:38 - discover so I'm going to say if debug
01:41 - checked I should make it prettier and
01:46 - design and use some CSS and all that
01:48 - sort of stuff if debug got checked draw
01:50 - all that debug information so now I'm
01:54 - going to refresh this page and we can
01:57 - see this is really what it should look
01:58 - like I don't need to see all of the
02:01 - debugging information I just want to see
02:03 - the system behave so I'm going to let it
02:04 - run for a little bit maybe to do back
02:07 - such a lame joke we stopped doing the
02:09 - joke I'm going to let it run for a
02:10 - little
02:10 - go on a train ride that that's not any
02:12 - better oh I'm back I'm back I came back
02:16 - and now let's take a look at the
02:19 - debugging information and we can see we
02:20 - have you know this is a little less
02:23 - obvious result than we got the last time
02:24 - but you can see there's some good ones
02:26 - here with a kind of strong attraction
02:28 - force a repulsion force of the poison
02:31 - and their perception radius being larger
02:33 - small so anyway this is a kind of nice
02:35 - way to add an interface that I can kind
02:36 - of take a look at different views it can
02:38 - add a slider or tweak a bunch of things
02:39 - I hope that you think about design like
02:42 - your creativity you know on the one hand
02:45 - the creativity you can add to this is a
02:46 - purely visual thing so what's the story
02:48 - you're telling
02:49 - what kind of visual elements will tell
02:51 - that story what kind of clever
02:53 - interactions can you offer a user but
02:55 - also I think your creativity can really
02:57 - be about designing the system so right
03:00 - now there's only food there's only
03:01 - poison there's only two weights and two
03:04 - perception radii what other things can
03:06 - you add to this I hope you add some of
03:08 - those like the code will be linked on
03:10 - github and all each code has a readme
03:14 - and if you want to add something you
03:15 - make you can add it with a pull request
03:18 - to that readme and if you don't know how
03:19 - to do that just add a comment on YouTube
03:22 - check my how to do a pull request video
03:24 - which I have somewhere I'll see you in a
03:26 - future Cody Jones thanks very much
