00:00 - hello apologies for this hat but I a kid
00:05 - too I was wearing it earlier I can't
00:06 - take it off because I have terrible hat
00:08 - hair okay what you're about to watch is
00:11 - my session at processing Community Day
00:13 - which was a day that happened past fall
00:16 - in Boston I'm posting a video of my
00:21 - session on the coding train YouTube
00:23 - channel mostly so that people see it and
00:26 - know to go to the processing foundation
00:28 - YouTube channel where all of the talks
00:31 - and presentations from all the different
00:33 - fellows and different artists are all
00:35 - there available for you to watch so I
00:37 - will include a link to the processing
00:39 - foundation's youtube channel subscribe
00:41 - the processing foundation to watch all
00:43 - these other videos you can actually just
00:44 - stop this video right now and get over
00:46 - there to watch them all there but if you
00:48 - want you can keep watching and my coding
00:50 - train session from the processing day
00:53 - will be happening next enjoy
00:57 - Thank You tae Yoon
00:59 - thank you to you for having this weird
01:01 - idea to try this I I want to first say
01:05 - that I have no plan which was to keep it
01:08 - on I at one point I sort of thought oh
01:11 - should I make some slides and like have
01:13 - some sort of like presentation and then
01:14 - I realized it wouldn't be an authentic
01:16 - and plus I you know it was easier for me
01:19 - to just relax on the train and not try
01:20 - to make up too much of a plan
01:21 - I'm going to attempt in some way somehow
01:24 - to recreate this is very weird that
01:27 - there's people here it's actually quite
01:31 - nice and and I may be that this is now
01:35 - then gonna be the new thing forget about
01:37 - this internet thing so I thought I I
01:40 - thought I'm now I'm feeling very
01:42 - uncomfortable for some reason so I
01:43 - thought I would doing something I like
01:45 - to do that helps me feel a little more
01:46 - comfortable and read from this book
01:48 - which is called a million random digits
01:52 - anybody have anybody have a request of
01:54 - which page you really like alright
02:00 - this is page 300 and I'm gonna actually
02:03 - go to page 322 and you can see we can
02:05 - figure out why at some point but hmm ten
02:10 - thousand four hundred and three oh wait
02:14 - it's story time twenty seven thousand
02:21 - five hundred seventy-five ninety five
02:24 - thousand nine hundred forty two actually
02:26 - feels less weird to do this by myself in
02:28 - a room with a camera than with ax people
02:29 - out there but eighty six thousand three
02:32 - hundred and thirty one forty five
02:34 - thousand four hundred sixty seven
02:36 - seventy five thousand four hundred sixty
02:39 - seven forty two thousand three hundred
02:41 - seventy seven twenty seven thousand six
02:44 - hundred eighty one fifty one thousand
02:46 - three hundred fifty nine and ten
02:48 - thousand okay thank you that was Jeb
02:50 - preciate you humoring me for me to
02:52 - attempt to do that I I also I brought
02:58 - this train whistle because I don't know
03:05 - I thought that would help um so what I
03:07 - thought I would attempt to do usually I
03:09 - spend at least forty five minutes doing
03:11 - absolutely nothing and then eventually I
03:13 - get to some coding tutorial but since I
03:15 - have a watch here since I'm this is only
03:17 - supposed to be about 45 minutes in its
03:19 - entirety I thought I would start by
03:21 - actually trying to code something I'm
03:23 - looking to work so so look so to the
03:25 - theme okay so first let me talk about
03:26 - something the theme one of the themes
03:27 - for a community is clouds I don't know
03:30 - clouds community but cloud is one of the
03:31 - themes of processing day and you might
03:33 - not actually be aware if you look at my
03:35 - name tag on but if you look at your name
03:36 - tag each one of your name tags has
03:38 - unique generative cloud created with
03:42 - p5.js and so what I'm gonna do is pull
03:44 - up right now this where do I want to go
03:49 - so I want to go to community clouds so
03:54 - this is a github repository so first of
03:56 - all by the way if you happen to have a
03:58 - laptop with you and you want to like
03:59 - pull it out and like code some stuff
04:00 - along I'm gonna walk through making
04:02 - something and posting it to this github
04:04 - repository but this is a github
04:06 - repository called community clouds and
04:08 - if I scroll down I'm gonna go to this
04:12 - link right here I'm going to open that
04:14 - new tab and here you might recognize on
04:18 - let's let's do something like processing
04:21 - you might recognize like as I click or I
04:23 - think if I use the arrow keys it's gonna
04:25 - scroll through all these different cloud
04:26 - designs and you might recognize the
04:28 - cloud design that's on your nametag is
04:30 - one of the ones up here and these are
04:31 - all have all been submitted by various
04:34 - viewers or processing programmers and
04:37 - artists and different people so right
04:38 - here we can see this is I was looking
04:40 - for the one that's the one that has the
04:42 - Train on it but this is a nice one by
04:43 - merging D H and you can change some
04:47 - color and change your name and I think
04:49 - even like download an SVG did that
04:51 - actually work let's go see what's there
04:55 - there we go so this is what was used to
04:58 - generate the clouds that are on your
05:00 - name packs the actual names are
05:01 - handwritten in the font I'm told is
05:03 - Danielle that's the font yeah Danielle
05:06 - wrote most of them and I think a variety
05:08 - people wrote them so what I thought I
05:10 - would do today is kind of try to do make
05:14 - a cloud design and then this clouds by
05:18 - the way made by Simon who is a seven
05:20 - year old actually he's just turned eight
05:23 - and he lives in Antwerp he's
05:25 - homeschooled and likes to watch coding
05:27 - videos all day long Simon I wanted to
05:29 - just give it shot out to Simon because
05:31 - he's a very dedicated viewer so I'm
05:35 - scrolling through these oh here we go
05:36 - this is submitted by Niels Weber with a
05:38 - nice little cloud in the Train alright
05:41 - so we're doing this I guess aren't we so
05:46 - what I'm gonna do I also had this crazy
05:48 - idea that maybe I would try to do this
05:49 - at the same time in processing and p5.js
05:53 - I thought if I had like a multiple
05:55 - monitor setup I could kind of like do
05:57 - them both at the same time that won't
05:58 - really work but I can go back and forth
05:59 - three into two so I'm gonna try to come
06:01 - up with a technique maybe we're gonna
06:02 - try to make the cloud look something
06:04 - like this you can code along if you want
06:08 - and then Astro after a little bit of
06:10 - time what I'll try to do although maybe
06:12 - I'll just mention this right now is
06:13 - there is a on this repository there's
06:16 - JavaScript file called generators J s me
06:20 - i M so me that's in our internet handle
06:24 - me I am so me created this system so if
06:26 - I click on generators J
06:28 - what you'll actually see here is that
06:30 - this is just an example if you write a
06:33 - function and that draws something and
06:36 - you can actually even return some values
06:39 - to define a rectangle of like where it's
06:41 - safe to draw text but that's actually
06:42 - not even important just this writing a
06:44 - function to draw something and then you
06:46 - add this line of code called register
06:47 - with the name of your fun the name of
06:50 - your function the name this is this
06:52 - could probably use some help to be a
06:55 - little more explanatory but I think this
06:57 - is supposed to be the title like
06:59 - processing day cloud and then this would
07:01 - be the name Daniel
07:04 - Schiffman or however you pronounce it so
07:07 - and by the way Jared Schiffman who was
07:10 - mentioned a bunch of times this morning
07:11 - I should point out spells his name with
07:13 - the C which i think is the correct
07:14 - spelling so I apologize for my the
07:16 - falling of my name it's no see no
07:18 - relation although I've ever been in the
07:22 - same room at the same time so there's an
07:26 - Internet conspiracy theory for you okay
07:27 - so let me go on here this is not going
07:31 - nearly as well as I had imagined it was
07:33 - gonna go alright so let's try this so I
07:36 - have this idea
07:37 - thank you taehyun for king down this
07:39 - whiteboard which i did have a black mark
07:42 - for at one point a hairless so i thought
07:46 - it would do in order to create a cloud
07:48 - so right now you see there's a p5.js
07:51 - sketch and it's got it's just using the
07:54 - ellipse function so the ellipse function
07:56 - draws a circle and one day one one way
07:59 - we could think about a cloud i think and
08:01 - by the way i sort of also had this idea
08:02 - of people could like shout out
08:03 - suggestions yes like go see if that
08:06 - works
08:06 - i don't know maybe that was a bad idea
08:08 - if we think of this cloud as assertive
08:11 - we think of this circle is having a
08:12 - radius I'll call that R the distance
08:14 - between the center and the edge there is
08:18 - a way that we can compute all of the
08:20 - points around this circle based on an
08:25 - angle relative to the x-axis maybe I
08:28 - could call that the Greek letter theta
08:29 - which is often used for signifying an
08:31 - angle could also just say angle but I
08:34 - can compute all of these points by
08:36 - keeping the same radius and changing the
08:39 - angle and that way if I do that I can
08:41 - use these
08:42 - functions that are in processing in p5
08:44 - called begin shape and n shape said all
08:49 - these vertices and I could draw exactly
08:50 - that same circle so that's what I want
08:52 - to start with if we could draw exactly
08:54 - that same circle then we can as a group
08:56 - are just me I don't know come up with
08:58 - some interest interesting ways to think
09:00 - about moving the these points a little
09:03 - bit around because what is this cloud
09:05 - other than an ellipse with some kind of
09:08 - like points of the ellipse kind of moved
09:11 - a little bit down it's actually
09:12 - interesting to think about I was
09:13 - thinking of using a sine wave to start
09:15 - with the sine wave is a nice pattern
09:17 - that looks like this it's actually just
09:20 - realizing if we take this bottom part
09:22 - and flip it up just thought of this
09:24 - actually while I was sitting in the
09:25 - other talk we could flip it up and we
09:29 - might get something that looks kind of
09:30 - like this which would be perhaps closely
09:32 - resembling this cloud and I and I have a
09:34 - feeling that one of these I'm sure if we
09:37 - scroll if I scroll through these it
09:39 - would find one that does exactly that
09:41 - but okay so what do you guys that good
09:44 - idea any suggestions yes pearly noise
09:48 - okay so that's good so we should
09:49 - definitely let me make a list here
09:50 - Perlin noise is probably something that
09:52 - would be nice to fold in here so one
09:54 - thing that's interesting about all these
09:55 - clouds or most of them at least is
09:58 - website I lost that URL is that you'll
10:04 - notice I don't know what I
10:06 - if I'm kind of like typing the name here
10:08 - oh no it's giving me a different cloud
10:10 - each time but if I was keeping on the
10:12 - same that's interesting way to spell
10:14 - processing if I was keeping on the same
10:17 - cloud each one of these will render
10:18 - itself a different way cuz it's a
10:20 - different algorithm so you know I might
10:22 - first start with the cloud that just
10:23 - looks the same every time but this idea
10:25 - of procedural design how could I have an
10:27 - algorithm that that its essence is the
10:32 - idea of this cloud but it's going to be
10:33 - different every time it's run all right
10:36 - let's let's go go to p5 the way this is
10:41 - actually the p5 GS web editor presented
10:44 - by Cassie earlier this morning and lots
10:47 - of other people have contributed to this
10:49 - thing it's amazing I haven't been using
10:51 - it in my videos yet but I hope to
10:52 - eventually soon but Cassie said go for
10:54 - it today
10:55 - I'm very excited to try so one thing
10:57 - that I'm gonna do I'm not even locked
10:59 - let me login oh boy
11:02 - do I have it I know I have an account
11:05 - that I use for teaching that wanted the
11:07 - class that I teach now it's called ICM
11:09 - so let me do I don't know the password
11:11 - that's really not good all right usually
11:14 - this is the point where I would like
11:16 - waste about 20 minutes like trying to
11:17 - look for the password for something
11:18 - while people are still arguing about
11:20 - whether like C++ or Java or something is
11:22 - faster in like the YouTube chat that's
11:25 - generally what it what it is um
11:27 - okay so do now is I'm gonna start with
11:31 - this idea of begin shape and you shout
11:37 - out if you can't read something or if
11:38 - you have a question cuz this is like
11:40 - instead of like a live YouTube chat that
11:42 - I'm kind of looking at trying to answer
11:44 - questions you are real people with real
11:45 - voices in in real life they are - right
11:51 - good point - all right so I'm gonna just
11:56 - start I'm just gonna do something really
11:57 - simple just to start like through the
11:59 - really basics I'm gonna say vertex 100
12:02 - 100 vertex 200 100 vertex 200 200 just
12:09 - to see that this idea works vertex 100
12:12 - 200 so what I try to do there in my head
12:14 - is kind of think about the points of a
12:17 - square so you know 100 100 200 you can
12:20 - see this path that gets filled and one
12:24 - thing I do here under n shape is I can
12:26 - add clothes and now it closes it so it's
12:29 - sort of hard for you to see this because
12:30 - of the projector quality but if i zoom
12:31 - in you can see what I've done now is
12:33 - I've unpacked the function that draws a
12:35 - square and I've drawn it with individual
12:38 - vertices which means you know I could do
12:41 - something like if I wanted to this first
12:42 - vertex could be determined by where the
12:48 - mouse is so that's so I have this
12:49 - dynamic shape so what I want to do now
12:52 - is which time do I have I will refer you
12:55 - to my video tutorial you go out in the
12:56 - hallway and watch it about polar
12:57 - Cartesian port now that's not a good
12:59 - idea so what do you need to in order to
13:00 - do that we need to do a little bit of
13:03 - math and the math comes from a field of
13:06 - mathematics called trigonometry the
13:07 - study of the sides the relation
13:09 - ship between the angles of a right
13:10 - triangle and the sides of a triangle you
13:13 - know what I drew this kind of poorly but
13:14 - this makes a triangle here so if this is
13:16 - an angle and this is the radius of that
13:18 - circle I want to calculate that points
13:22 - how far to move across the X and how far
13:24 - to move up why and I do I wasn't Joey I
13:28 - do have a video tutorial where I go
13:29 - through this in a bit more detail but
13:31 - the it turns out there's a really nice
13:33 - formula for that which I can say x
13:35 - equals R times cosine of theta and y
13:39 - equals R times theta so the reason why
13:43 - it's you know I kind of like this idea
13:45 - of saying oh and by the way let now I
13:49 - don't know what that means exactly but
13:50 - that person because you're wondering I
13:54 - think you're on switch I haven't fully
13:57 - wrapped my head around but someday I'm
13:59 - gonna be a constant person very good so
14:04 - let R equal and I should probably say
14:06 - something like radius I have a bad habit
14:07 - of using one letter variable names so if
14:09 - I say radius equals 100 and I say angle
14:13 - equals and look there you want to say 45
14:15 - degrees wouldn't it be nice and I'm
14:18 - gonna get rid of this now
14:19 - I mean we're gonna need begin shape and
14:21 - end shape again I'm gonna put this
14:22 - console down here just give myself a
14:24 - little more space wouldn't it be nice if
14:26 - I could just say something like point
14:29 - radius comma angle and we're at that
14:34 - point it's there is that so I drew a
14:39 - point but it's a value excellent matter
14:41 - what I call a variable name I could pick
14:42 - up I could call it you know unicorn and
14:45 - puppy it's not gonna draw a unicorn it's
14:46 - just the name that I made so what I want
14:49 - a p5 and most computer graphic systems
14:52 - only think in terms of Cartesian
14:54 - coordinate systems which is the XY stuff
14:56 - so that I can take those formulas and I
14:58 - could say let X equal radius times what
15:02 - did I say cosine of the angle and I can
15:05 - say let y equal radius times sine of the
15:10 - angle I'm trying to check the time and
15:12 - and then I could say point X comma Y and
15:16 - then where's that point now that's
15:20 - mutters at the book oh there it is so
15:22 - where is it
15:23 - actually is it 45 degrees from where so
15:27 - let me draw a line from zero zero to
15:29 - that that'll help us see it a little
15:30 - better
15:31 - stroke wait for and let me say line 0 0
15:36 - X Y so what actually happened is I'm
15:39 - drawing it at a rotation of 45 but not
15:44 - degrees so that's the other thing I have
15:45 - to remember is that most computer
15:47 - graphics programming systems don't you
15:49 - know I might think of like this is 180
15:51 - degrees this is 90 degrees of this like
15:53 - that's how I intuitively think of angles
15:55 - in a unit of measurement called degrees
15:56 - but most computer graphic systems using
15:58 - you know metric called radians insert
16:01 - link to other video tutorial about
16:03 - radians maybe I don't know so you can I
16:06 - don't if you can insert a hyperlink on a
16:08 - whiteboard but I just say hyperlink
16:11 - anymore is that a thing so but one thing
16:15 - I can do with p5 which is rather nice is
16:17 - I could say angle mode degrees so I can
16:19 - actually just have it think and turn and
16:20 - now you can see oh it's actually a 45
16:22 - degrees it's actually you can see that
16:24 - line is at a 45 degree angle but I want
16:26 - to think about this from the center so
16:29 - one thing I can do to do that is I can
16:31 - say translate I better save this it's
16:33 - too late now and I think we're gonna by
16:36 - the way hoping this session we're also
16:37 - gonna debug a little bug the web if you
16:41 - have Auto refresher on it kind of
16:42 - crashes so they were and all of you can
16:44 - file everyone can file a github issue
16:46 - all together at once it'll be like a
16:47 - four unknowns okay so what I'm gonna do
16:50 - now if I can retain my train of thought
16:54 - is all right I was saying translate so
16:57 - first of all I'm gonna save this let's
16:58 - first I'm going to make it give it a
16:59 - name this is called process processing
17:01 - Community Day cloud let's do that and
17:04 - I'm gonna hit save now incidentally if
17:06 - this is a little bit hard for you to
17:07 - just like memorize or track down but if
17:09 - you go to this link right now which is
17:11 - alpha editor p5.js org slash ICM
17:14 - sketches and then this crazy sequence of
17:17 - characters you will actually open up the
17:19 - code that I'm typing it won't update in
17:21 - real time we don't have some we don't
17:22 - have that kind of fancy real-time
17:24 - mind-meld thing going on just yet but if
17:27 - you want to start with the code that I
17:28 - have you could certainly do that and if
17:30 - your log if you've logged into your own
17:32 - account the thing you can actually do is
17:34 - you can say
17:35 - implicate so you actually won't see an
17:37 - option for save because you're opening a
17:39 - sketch from my account you'll see an
17:41 - option called duplicate which you can
17:42 - then duplicate and then save but we'll
17:45 - see we'll see how well things work for
17:47 - your using this so I'm gonna say
17:47 - translate - with / - / - now there it is
17:55 - at least I'm drawing this line from the
17:57 - center and what would happen by the way
17:59 - if I just made this angle a global
18:03 - variable and I just said something like
18:05 - angle + + so we can see this line is now
18:10 - spinning because I'm just changing the
18:12 - angle the radius is not changing if I
18:14 - made the radius a global variable I
18:19 - don't know if this has a point to it I
18:20 - was gonna are actually just make it a
18:21 - random value if I made the radius
18:23 - something random you can see it's doing
18:27 - that as it's spinning around so right
18:29 - now I'm just showing you how to trace
18:31 - that path but instead of doing doing
18:34 - that as an animation what if I did all
18:36 - of the points around the circle a one
18:38 - time through draw and to do that
18:40 - all I would need to do is say for what
18:45 - let angle equals zero angle like you
18:48 - can't not do this out typing eye angle
18:50 - is less than I don't know 360 degrees
18:52 - angle plus + and let's try to see if I
18:55 - can create a little bit of additional
18:56 - space here so the code is visible oh
18:59 - that's not gonna be enough space for
19:00 - this and then if I do this and then I
19:04 - know what I'm doing anymore oh let's get
19:06 - rid of this angle plus + and do this
19:09 - there we go and the radius is changing
19:11 - like crazy okay there we go so now you
19:15 - can see I've drawn all those lines I
19:16 - don't want them to be lines let's look
19:18 - at them as points there's so many of
19:22 - them which is kind of unnecessary right
19:23 - now let's go 5 degrees for every point
19:25 - there we go you can see so I've traced
19:27 - these and by the way interestingly
19:28 - enough if I say well I was gonna say X
19:31 - radius but another term for that might
19:34 - be with but it half with I know what's
19:36 - call I'm gonna call it X radius that's
19:38 - probably like a weird thing to call it
19:40 - and Y radius if I make the X radius 200
19:43 - you can see this is now how I now have
19:46 - an elliptical path okay
19:49 - we're somewhere let's make it even lower
19:51 - resolution 15 lets save you save as like
19:57 - 15 times we keep all of our old versions
19:59 - where we've been okay so now what I want
20:02 - to do begin shape and shape and vertex
20:16 - made a circle because can we be done now
20:21 - it's very kind of you to applaud the
20:24 - sort of badly drawn circle that doesn't
20:26 - so let's add clothes it is interesting
20:29 - to see here let's add also just for
20:33 - right now let me say no fill and then we
20:37 - can see here and and then I'm gonna I'm
20:39 - like overly neurotic about spacing I'm
20:42 - gonna move that over a little bit so I'm
20:43 - tempted to translate this into
20:44 - processing because I said I was gonna do
20:46 - them both but maybe I'll try to do that
20:48 - more at the end so now we're somewhere
20:50 - Amen have any questions or thoughts or
20:52 - ideas yes strokeweight
21:01 - and no Phil are those always global or
21:04 - could they be tied to specific objects
21:06 - it's a great question
21:07 - so those functions they they almost they
21:12 - set a global state in a way so it's they
21:16 - this there's a state of no way you can
21:18 - almost think of the p5 or processing
21:20 - system as there's you know a person with
21:22 - a marker or a big bag of markers who's
21:24 - looking ready to go I've got some thick
21:26 - markers some thin ones a bunch of
21:27 - different colors so every time you would
21:29 - set something like say fill 255 comma 0
21:33 - 0 processing the brain would kind of go
21:35 - and pull out the red marker it's gonna
21:36 - use it continuously until you say fill
21:39 - something else so it's they really do
21:42 - apply if if I only if I put stroke wait
21:45 - for no fill everything I draw on this
21:47 - entire sketch will have those but if I
21:50 - had something at the bottom where it was
21:51 - like oh I'm also drawing you know a
21:53 - little rectangle at the top right corner
21:56 - oops by the way I translated the center
22:00 - to the center which is easy to forget
22:01 - that I've done that
22:02 - like why is that not in the top I was
22:04 - thought it would be the top left but if
22:06 - I wanted to put it in the top left I
22:07 - could say like - 200 - 200 but the point
22:11 - of what I was saying is now if I give
22:13 - this a different setting so to speak
22:15 - you're gonna see that we've got red
22:17 - there now so it's really up to you to
22:19 - manage that to figure out like I want I
22:21 - need to collect pieces of my code
22:23 - together and ultimately a nice way of
22:26 - managing that is with something called
22:27 - one way of managing they have something
22:29 - called object-oriented programming which
22:30 - I am avoiding for the sake of today
22:32 - other questions or ideas yes oh yeah
22:41 - make that a variable yeah yeah so that's
22:43 - a great idea so actually that's what I
22:44 - mean so this should you know you could I
22:47 - think you could make the argument that
22:48 - anytime you see a number that's not
22:50 - written as a variable you might want to
22:52 - make that a variable but you can adjust
22:53 - it and play with it and actually one of
22:54 - the really things this is one of the
22:55 - things I love about p5 let's do this I'm
22:57 - like all right like what I gotta get to
22:59 - the cloud part but let's say I made that
23:00 - a variable and I called it and by the
23:02 - way I've done something kind of weird
23:03 - and awkward here which I put my variable
23:05 - definitions in between set up and draw
23:06 - it's fine step size equals 15 so we can
23:15 - see this if I make this step size and
23:17 - one of the things I want to try to do
23:18 - right now is I'm gonna say I'm gonna
23:21 - create something called and this is
23:23 - something you can't easily do in
23:24 - processing okay hold on alright now I
23:28 - can't live with myself anymore I'm gonna
23:29 - move this up here it works either way
23:32 - and this should think this one's
23:35 - probably supposed to be Const I think
23:36 - it's was VidCon somebody will teach me
23:37 - about Const after this slide are equals
23:41 - create slider and this is part of a
23:45 - library that's part of did it appear
23:47 - anywhere hold on let me give it some
23:49 - numbers 0 oh we're gonna do some
23:52 - debugging hold on
23:56 - 550 25 do you see a slider anywhere over
24:01 - here oh wait let's try it stop and start
24:05 - okay maybe oh the problem happened or
24:07 - let's look at the console
24:08 - oh good where I was worried that we
24:10 - wouldn't have any bugs oh no bug here
24:11 - okay
24:12 - we must go to level 2 here
24:16 - view developer here comes console okay
24:26 - so I think we did actually so this is
24:29 - the bug that let me go to github right
24:31 - now I'm gonna show you I I really would
24:33 - love help figuring this bug out I know
24:34 - that Cassie would too and I think it was
24:36 - originally reported by Kate who's at
24:39 - UCLA and was a google Summer of Code
24:41 - student worked on WebGL Kate's awesome
24:43 - so I'm gonna Kate haul them back so hold
24:45 - on processing p5 I love that this bug
24:51 - came up live oh no at website editor web
24:54 - editor oh my god there's too many do I
24:56 - have the URL memorized I do okay so now
25:01 - I'm gonna go into issues and I'm gonna
25:06 - look down here this can't save sketch
25:10 - sketch corrupted so this is an error
25:13 - that we could see that I posted so one
25:16 - thing here's the thing about filing good
25:18 - and helpful bug reports I'm not saying
25:20 - that I've done this but he's hard for
25:21 - you to to follow to read some of this
25:23 - text but you can see Kate first posted
25:25 - about this error had the same error I
25:28 - tried to I figure out I noticed that was
25:32 - only happening when auto fresh related
25:34 - and then hey this actually was during
25:37 - class I had a different github account
25:39 - we kind of figured out that this code
25:41 - caused this error but I think what would
25:43 - be really useful anyone wants to take
25:45 - this as a project under themselves for
25:46 - the afternoon would be to try and maybe
25:48 - do a screencast and like leave the
25:50 - JavaScript console open put Auto refresh
25:52 - on see if you can figure out an exact
25:53 - sequence of characters to type in the
25:56 - web editor that causes this error to
25:57 - happen I will tell you that right now if
25:59 - this error happens for you you're this
26:01 - strategy to get around this error is
26:03 - this is very fancy select all copy
26:06 - refresh reload and it'll be at some
26:12 - state before it broke ah look at that
26:14 - the single apostrophe oh yeah I know I'm
26:18 - a little afraid to use my pathetic
26:21 - soundboard effects too much but so I
26:25 - wonder if I've already broken it again
26:26 - but I'm just gonna do a paste and then
26:27 - I'm gonna try doing this
26:29 - now we have the slider so what I wanted
26:32 - to show you which is exciting about you
26:34 - working in the browser is you can get
26:36 - some of these interface elements for
26:39 - free essentially this is just a plain
26:41 - vanilla I guess is what's offered a job
26:44 - as a Mel five input element a range
26:47 - element it's a slider and P five the Dom
26:49 - library has some nice hooks into that so
26:52 - I could say here step size equals slider
26:56 - dot value so now if I do this we can see
27:01 - that I can kind of like work with the
27:03 - resolution of that particular and I and
27:06 - at what you might be wondering what is
27:07 - this range this is the range so the
27:10 - range is between five and fifty and the
27:12 - default value is 25 so if I wanted to
27:15 - kind of and I didn't want to put it at
27:17 - zero if I put it at zero I've got a
27:19 - problem because if this value ever gets
27:21 - to be zero we're gonna have an infinite
27:22 - loop browser crashing thing okay so I
27:25 - made that a little thing we can play
27:27 - with that should be interesting let me
27:29 - give it a bigger range just to and start
27:34 - it something like this okay got to keep
27:36 - moving here it's three o'clock
27:38 - yours I'm like I have to leave and go
27:40 - home for dinner but that's not what's
27:42 - happening now so I'm usually never mind
27:44 - I don't know how many's actually watched
27:45 - one of these live streams that really
27:47 - don't recommend that you watch them you
27:49 - can watch the machiya by the way is here
27:51 - you can raise your hand and the audience
27:53 - he helps with all of the video editing
27:55 - from Enys from originally from Montreal
27:58 - yes but living somewhere else in Canada
28:00 - right now okay so what do I want to do
28:05 - here okay so let's try this sine wave
28:07 - idea now interestingly enough I'm
28:09 - already using like sine and cosine so
28:10 - this is kind of this crazy thing going
28:12 - on whereas the idea of the sine function
28:14 - the trigonometry function sine is that
28:17 - it calculates the value of in a right
28:20 - triangle of the length of the opposite
28:23 - side of the angle divided by the
28:26 - hypotenuse which in this case is y
28:27 - divided by our sine of the angle equals
28:30 - y divided by R and so you can see how
28:34 - this formula is just another way of
28:35 - writing that but it just also so happens
28:38 - that if you take the sine of a value and
28:40 - you just increment that value over time
28:42 - you get a number that oscillates between
28:44 - that's positive 1 and negative 1
28:46 - smoothly and it doesn't you could this
28:48 - is sort of a wave pattern this is this
28:50 - would not be smooth this would be
28:52 - perfectly linear like a like a triangle
28:54 - wave I think it's sometimes called
28:55 - somebody who knows about sound or
28:57 - something will know something about this
28:58 - whereas this is more like a sine wave so
29:01 - what I want to do is apply the sine wave
29:03 - somehow to this X radius and Y radius so
29:07 - I could probably reuse that angle
29:09 - because I already have this value that's
29:11 - incrementing but let's kind of be safe
29:13 - and let's just I'm gonna this might be a
29:15 - bad idea but I might just have a
29:16 - different variable called a and what I
29:19 - want to do is I want to basically say
29:22 - that X radius equals I'm gonna say 200
29:26 - plus some offset and Y radius equals
29:30 - what did I set those values up as
29:32 - originally I mean these should be local
29:34 - variables now clean this all up laters
29:37 - fine
29:39 - so what what I say 100 plus offset so
29:45 - the idea here is that I want I need to
29:47 - have some sort of offset so that's no
29:52 - offset that's an offset of 100 just
29:56 - making every radii bigger but now if I
29:59 - can have the offset oscillate
30:01 - differently so between plus one and
30:03 - negative one so if I were to say sine of
30:05 - a times 20 and now the angle is the same
30:13 - and sine of 0 is what is that one zero
30:17 - somebody knows it's very stressful to do
30:21 - math in front of a live audience
30:23 - try it really it's like some people are
30:24 - good at it's not me okay so so but now I
30:29 - can increase that angle so I think what
30:31 - would be interesting here is to say
30:33 - something like this yeah let's increase
30:36 - it more yeah let's increase it more
30:40 - let's oh this is looking great now there
30:43 - we go that looks totally like a cloud
30:45 - right oh my god it's terrible so it's no
30:52 - I didn't change it to degrees everything
30:54 - is now in degrees so
30:56 - so interestingly enough I have a feeling
30:58 - that the step size is gonna be our
31:00 - friend here oh we want it to be smaller
31:02 - there we go that kind of looks more like
31:04 - the sine wave you know I probably could
31:06 - if I just kind of got rid of that stroke
31:08 - rate of four it's gonna appear so much
31:09 - much smoother now so I'm gonna I'm
31:12 - actually going to just for the moment
31:15 - let's give an initial step size of five
31:19 - and okay so so here's let's at least try
31:26 - the what I like to do with my youtube
31:28 - channel is make really ugly stuff
31:30 - because I don't have any talent in that
31:31 - area but at least kind of hopefully
31:33 - explain it somewhat well and then people
31:35 - with talent make it beautiful so that's
31:37 - sort of what I'm hoping will happen here
31:38 - because I haven't um but let's at least
31:40 - go this one further step a couple
31:42 - further steps one is let's think about
31:44 - the absolute valley let's think about
31:46 - never letting a sine oscillate back down
31:49 - to negative one so what if has its
31:50 - oscillating towards negative one it
31:52 - stops and keeps going right back up I
31:54 - think we could achieve that instantly
31:55 - with the absolute value perfect maybe I
32:05 - should prepare these in advance that
32:06 - could be good let's make the canvas a
32:08 - little bit wider just so we can kind of
32:12 - see this better and we can you know we
32:14 - got some variables we can play with here
32:15 - to do so all sorts of strange things all
32:17 - right
32:17 - so this is the basic idea let's just
32:20 - pretend just there's just because I want
32:22 - to add the sort of Perlin noise thing
32:23 - and think about some ways to make it
32:25 - smoother and we could try curve vertex
32:26 - that's a way to maybe smooth it out but
32:30 - let me at least let me at least show you
32:32 - you were following along and you you
32:34 - arrived at this moment and it still has
32:36 - that weird red rectangle over there
32:37 - which I almost feel like we need to
32:38 - leave in because it's like it must mean
32:40 - something right I'll comment it out so
32:44 - one of the things I can do now is I can
32:48 - go to here let's see so this this this
32:52 - is a this system which generates that
32:55 - website if you have never made a pull
32:57 - request before on github this might be a
33:00 - place for you to give it give it a try I
33:02 - was this is a hopefully fairly friendly
33:04 - so you do you know if you haven't done a
33:06 - pull request before so this is the URL I
33:08 - guess I'll try to like publish all these
33:10 - URLs or
33:10 - beat them or something like that or this
33:12 - will get recorded anyway you can't find
33:14 - it it's
33:15 - github.com slash coding trained
33:17 - community clouds and you would have to
33:19 - you do have to have a github account but
33:21 - once you're signed into your account
33:22 - when I'm logged in as myself somehow
33:24 - that's gonna be a little bit of a
33:25 - problem but that's fine there's this
33:28 - button right here so for only 1995
33:33 - doesn't cost anything I have tutorials
33:35 - on get and github that you could get
33:37 - outside no I don't but if you want to
33:39 - know more about getting it up I also
33:40 - have some other tutorials but so without
33:43 - the full story what I basically can do
33:45 - is this edit says I want to propose a
33:47 - change to this file so if I click Edit
33:50 - and the MIT Media Lab magical internet
33:56 - will then land me in here and I can now
33:58 - I'm in a text editor I'm gonna zoom in
33:59 - so you can see what I'm doing and I'm
34:01 - gonna write function I'm gonna call this
34:04 - PCD
34:05 - cloud and I'm just gonna braid a
34:09 - function with an open curly bracket and
34:11 - a close curly bracket then I'm gonna
34:13 - rather it with terrifying way oh I'm go
34:17 - back to here and I'm gonna think about
34:19 - okay what have I done
34:20 - let's see one thing that we could be
34:22 - sure about yeah the sliders gonna be a
34:25 - problem there's a few things that I've
34:26 - done I don't have this translates gonna
34:28 - be a problem
34:28 - mm-hmm it's okay everything can be fixed
34:30 - later so I'm gonna go grab all this code
34:33 - and I'm gonna just the code that draws
34:37 - this design idea and this is for a fixed
34:41 - design I'm going to now come and paste
34:45 - it in here and there it is so let's look
34:49 - at this a little bit okay step size was
34:52 - try five and probably these variables
34:58 - need to be eyeball in code and just
35:01 - assuming it's gonna work it's generally
35:02 - not a good idea why not
35:05 - you should you just live on the edge
35:07 - okay so here we go so now what I need to
35:11 - do is I also need to register this
35:15 - function so I'm gonna say what did I
35:19 - call it PCD cloud I'm gonna call it
35:24 - processing community day let me just
35:30 - call it pc d pc d cloud and then this is
35:34 - by processing community heard dispel in
35:41 - front of people - okay so now I'm gonna
35:43 - go I'm gonna go down now here's the
35:45 - thing I have this nice fancy button
35:48 - because of all this power that I wield
35:50 - on the internet now I have this button
35:52 - that says commit changes which means
35:54 - it's going to commit directly to the
35:55 - master branch which is Matt that's just
35:57 - a fancy word for that's the actual code
35:59 - that's running on the webpage oh there's
36:01 - a question yeah
36:03 - oh I spelled it wrong I'll live
36:07 - corrections this is awesome usually I
36:09 - usually I I find out about it like two
36:11 - weeks later and I have a sleepless night
36:13 - of some can I totally messed up thank
36:15 - you so now I'm gonna go down this is
36:19 - very hard to do this all with zoom let's
36:21 - see let me zoom out scroll down up
36:23 - scroll over here okay so you won't see
36:27 - this option because you unless you're me
36:29 - which might be an interesting like
36:31 - Freaky Friday thing right but you you
36:36 - could what you'll probably see is some
36:37 - variation of this but basically want to
36:39 - propose this I'm gonna simulate not
36:41 - being myself in proposing this change
36:43 - and actually I don't know me I am so me
36:45 - who has been they've been helping me
36:48 - manage these pull requests might
36:51 - actually be in England somewhere live on
36:53 - the internet not watching this but
36:54 - waiting for me to do this because I
36:56 - mentioned I might try to do this and
36:58 - maybe it'll get maybe it'll get merged
36:59 - so I'm it proposed file change and once
37:03 - I do that you think you're done but it's
37:06 - like reminding me okay this is live from
37:08 - processing day I don't have anything
37:11 - else to say still live from processing
37:15 - day and I spelled live wrong this is an
37:19 - ugly cloud that I made it's not ugly
37:23 - let's not be mean to the cloud this is a
37:24 - cloud that I made as an example it's a
37:29 - view to all clouds are beautiful okay so
37:31 - now I'm gonna create the pull request
37:33 - I'm gonna request
37:36 - me I am so be to review it and then I'm
37:41 - gonna hit create pull request and one of
37:44 - the things that we've created this poll
37:46 - Chris I can actually just go and merge
37:47 - it maybe I will one we could do just as
37:49 - sort of see as I could say file change
37:51 - one thing that's nice here is if I were
37:52 - the one reviewing it and I could say you
37:56 - know maybe you should learn about Const
38:01 - which is definitely a comment I get a
38:03 - lot and add a single comment okay so so
38:07 - yeah you can I forget that you can't
38:09 - exactly see what I'm typing so this is
38:11 - the idea so I have now made a cloud I
38:13 - have registered pull request I don't I'm
38:16 - not going to merge it let's what do we
38:18 - have like ten more minutes here so I
38:20 - think what I do is I would like to
38:22 - either take questions which could be
38:26 - just about anything like I can step out
38:29 - character but if there is no it's just
38:30 - me
38:31 - but I could read some more random
38:33 - numbers but um but I can answer
38:35 - questions that are more meta if people
38:36 - are interested in like about teaching or
38:38 - processing or about how this like what
38:39 - YouTube stuff if you want to ask I could
38:41 - also take a few I didn't get to the
38:42 - Perlin noise suggestion which is like an
38:44 - excellent one so I might leave that as
38:45 - an exercise but if there's some time or
38:47 - you have a suggestion I'm happy to try
38:48 - it but let me see what questions there
38:49 - might be yeah yeah good great question
38:54 - so one of the reasons why the web editor
38:59 - isn't fully out there it's like cafe I
39:01 - think said like open secret or something
39:03 - it's because we a we haven't taken the
39:05 - time to announce it and make sure all
39:06 - the people have put so much time and
39:08 - work into it get our have a nice moment
39:10 - to get credit for all this work and also
39:12 - because we haven't fully documented and
39:15 - information about how to use it but that
39:18 - question easily could come up so this is
39:20 - all we hosted on Amazon Web Services so
39:23 - I don't mean to get so technical here
39:25 - but it's running there's a it's an AWS
39:28 - instant so there's a server and it has
39:30 - your account your name and your password
39:32 - stored encrypted and so your code is
39:35 - saved database associated with your
39:37 - account you can if right now if I wanted
39:40 - to do file download it will download a
39:42 - zip of all of the code and another thing
39:45 - that I'm not showing you here if I go
39:47 - over to the here as you can see this is
39:48 - actually these are the
39:49 - files associated with this particular
39:51 - sketch it's just a CSS file if I wanted
39:54 - to add that which I'm not
39:55 - it's an index.html file which has
39:57 - references the p5 libraries and then
39:59 - this is the actual code that I'm writing
40:01 - and so the reason why you know we make
40:03 - these kind of decisions when we talked
40:05 - about this and gone back and forth but
40:06 - the idea is that that is not open at
40:09 - first and this is meant to be a platform
40:13 - you know I like to think of the audience
40:14 - for this as like it's three hours on a
40:17 - Saturday and people want to learn
40:18 - something about programming and make
40:19 - something and be able to share it really
40:21 - quickly on so I I'm tempted to keep
40:23 - showing you all these other features but
40:24 - eh I want to let others who have
40:26 - actually developed all these features
40:27 - show those when the time comes and also
40:30 - I would just be here for hours if I
40:31 - started like thinking about all that
40:32 - weird right here yes yeah yes so the
40:43 - intention is for that to always be true
40:44 - I mean currently right now I'm sorry
40:45 - there is no distinction between public
40:48 - and private sketches in a way like
40:50 - everything's private because you could
40:52 - never find it if you don't know the URL
40:54 - but on that in the other hand everything
40:56 - is public because there's no nothing's
40:57 - hidden behind anything if you have the
40:58 - URL so the intention is to and actually
41:02 - this has been a really amazing tool for
41:04 - me teaching in that hike work on an
41:07 - example in class I used to jump through
41:08 - all these hoops died for like email it
41:10 - to the students or like posted to github
41:12 - or I've custom it now I just send them
41:14 - an email after class with links to five
41:15 - sketches and of course there's you can
41:17 - imagine so many more possible features
41:19 - in terms of a classroom I've seen soon
41:20 - on here in the audience here who's
41:22 - developed something called open
41:23 - processing which is via has a lot of
41:25 - similar features to the web editor but
41:27 - is much more geared towards the social
41:29 - aspect of being able to collect and
41:32 - share and teach with collections of
41:34 - sketches and this really read the moment
41:36 - is just focusing on kind of editing the
41:39 - code editing experience yeah but so
41:41 - definitely if you're teaching there
41:42 - another web editor that we definitely
41:43 - check out is open processing org yeah
42:03 - I'm gonna long time ago I made if I
42:06 - google video lesson documentation
42:08 - Schiffman I think this Sun comes up with
42:10 - a blog post from this is from 2013 so
42:13 - this is pretty out of date but the
42:16 - system I'm using is mostly the same so I
42:20 - so what I have is this actually used to
42:24 - be my all this is my office at NYU but I
42:25 - found a closet that had some filing
42:27 - cabinets so a page that painted a wall
42:33 - green have a standing desk and a
42:35 - computer and a machine and a camera so
42:38 - everything goes through one mac tower
42:41 - the camera input the input from my
42:43 - laptop the input from the mic and I'm
42:46 - using software I used to use software
42:47 - called Wirecast which is commercial
42:49 - software for live broadcasting and I
42:52 - recently started using something called
42:53 - open broadcasting studio and so this is
43:00 - that so you know I don't know to what
43:02 - you know I kind of have jumped through
43:04 - all these hoops to kind of have an
43:05 - elaborate setup in terms of a green
43:08 - screen and live compositing and like you
43:10 - know iPad was sound and this to try to
43:12 - be escort of goofy and creative with it
43:15 - as possible and the truth of the matter
43:17 - is there's no reason why I couldn't just
43:19 - download this right now turn on my
43:22 - webcam you know put my face in the
43:23 - corner and live stream me doing this I
43:26 - could have just done that from this room
43:27 - right now maybe I should have done that
43:28 - but so I would encourage people if
43:31 - you're interested too don't you just to
43:32 - like try it and I'm happy I can be
43:36 - helpful to it the things that I've
43:37 - really been trying to do and I promised
43:40 - myself I wouldn't open up my YouTube
43:42 - page in this but there's no other way
43:44 - all right revert your eyes for a minute
43:46 - I guess I just have to revert my own
43:48 - eyes
43:49 - all right one of the things that I'm
43:50 - trying to do is have more and more
43:52 - guests so if I go to playlist quickly
43:55 - we're gonna get off of this before this
43:56 - even starts playing playlists
44:00 - yes Oh YouTube by the way YouTube this
44:03 - is very YouTube is great yeah YouTube it
44:06 - has its issues it's been wonderful for
44:07 - me to be able to discover it but I think
44:09 - if I click here it gives me all
44:10 - playlists no save playlists
44:12 - this is nuts I ran to this the other day
44:14 - created playlists it's just showing me
44:17 - featured playlists there we go I would
44:19 - like to look see here's tiga I think was
44:21 - somewhere I saw thought I saw his face
44:23 - no I saw Claire's face who's dying so
44:26 - I've been trying to have more guests
44:28 - here we go guest tutorials and
44:29 - interviews and sorry
44:32 - there's Claire look so this is something
44:35 - that trying to do more of which is -
44:37 - there's two aspects of this one is that
44:40 - studio that I have in New York I'm
44:41 - opening it up at the moment for like
44:43 - students and other people who work at
44:45 - NYU to use it if anybody is interested
44:48 - or know somebody wants to make a video
44:49 - tutorial and I'm opening it up for
44:51 - people to make video tutorials and own
44:52 - and take that content anywhere they want
44:54 - I have discovered that people seem to
44:56 - enjoy publishing a tutorial through my
44:58 - channel just because it has now it has
45:00 - this sort of built-in audience it has
45:02 - you know pros and cons there but so one
45:04 - of the things I'm trying to do is create
45:06 - opportunities and think about ways for
45:09 - more voices and faces and people from
45:12 - different backgrounds and places in the
45:15 - world to be able to make tutorials as
45:19 - well so that's um that's one thing that
45:20 - I'm really interested in and was kind of
45:22 - in a way the original idea for like
45:25 - setting up this more prop this studio
45:28 - thing yes
45:41 - yeah I'm asking him to talk about how
45:50 - yeah how how you think pedagogically
45:54 - about sort of individual horses races
45:57 - versus this kind of years long per grant
46:00 - and right hopefully more years yeah it's
46:03 - it's a really good question and it's one
46:05 - that I really struggle with and don't
46:07 - have like a clear like oh I know I know
46:09 - how it all works this is it but it's
46:11 - definitely I'm trying to find it by I do
46:12 - think of what I'm doing with these video
46:15 - tutorials as something very different
46:17 - than something in a classroom setting or
46:21 - you know protected this is very
46:22 - presentational but what could be more
46:24 - like a workshop setting in person it's
46:28 - my hope that these videos support
46:30 - classroom settings but and they and I
46:33 - and mostly a lot of times what I end up
46:37 - the videos I think of as in a similar
46:40 - way as similar to how a textbook might
46:42 - support a classroom setting but
46:44 - certainly one of the things I aspire to
46:46 - do more is less like it which is which
46:50 - is weird for me to say because it's
46:51 - basically that all I do on the YouTube
46:52 - channel but less like let me just show
46:54 - you how to do stuff and talk and talk
46:55 - and talk and talk and talk and more
46:58 - let's try something together let's let's
47:02 - ask the questions let's try to solve it
47:03 - together so more interactive workshop
47:06 - exercises in class type stuff and part
47:08 - of the reason why I like try to do these
47:10 - videos in theory is to try to allow more
47:11 - time for that in class to have fall back
47:14 - to some more presentational content if
47:16 - that's a useful way to learn it and one
47:18 - thing that I do think is really
47:19 - important to state is that everybody
47:22 - learns in a different way and that while
47:25 - these videos are hopefully useful to met
47:27 - some people they are not useful to other
47:28 - people there's you know questions around
47:30 - accessibility of course as well I'm you
47:32 - know not all these videos are captioned
47:33 - so this is something that I really have
47:35 - to hopefully we'll continue to be more
47:37 - thoughtful about engage more people with
47:38 - to try to figure out better ways to to
47:41 - reach more people and be more inclusive
47:43 - yes hi first thing I want to say your
47:48 - some and I want to be like you when I
47:50 - grow up okay thank you
47:54 - would you have as an educator but you
47:57 - have like some kind of high level advice
48:00 - for other people who are trying to teach
48:02 - these techniques of using programming
48:04 - and being creative and being expressive
48:05 - in other settings
48:07 - oh yeah classrooms or even on other
48:09 - online practices yeah do you recommend
48:12 - other people yeah well to be very broad
48:15 - and kind of open-ended about it I would
48:16 - say to me the things that are important
48:18 - for me to keep in mind or don't make any
48:21 - assumptions about what people know every
48:24 - and like just and so don't make any
48:29 - assumption what people know slow down
48:31 - let things have time to breathe and and
48:34 - then just try to find the stuff that
48:38 - you're excited about and show that
48:40 - excitement through teaching so I think
48:42 - that when you're excited about trying
48:45 - something the people who are part of the
48:47 - learning process will be more apt to be
48:50 - engaged I think about learning that as
48:52 - well but really I just that I think it's
48:55 - really difficult and I fall into this
48:56 - trap all the time I was saying API the
48:58 - other day and in a context like over and
49:01 - over and over again and finally somebody
49:02 - said what's an API and you know I'm you
49:05 - know that person like took a lot of
49:06 - courage to ask that question because
49:08 - that person probably thought no of
49:09 - everybody else in the room knows and I'm
49:11 - the doesn't like you're all wondering
49:12 - what API is maybe my video tutorial on
49:16 - it's like this is like my sales pitch
49:19 - here but I'm so this something I think
49:21 - yep to create an environment where
49:23 - people feel comfortable doing that is
49:25 - really important I'm not saying I know
49:26 - how to do that something I aspire to do
49:28 - or try to do I saw there was another
49:30 - question here yeah it was actually quite
49:35 - similar to that one but it's more like
49:39 - what do you think are qualities of a
49:41 - person who's trying to be an educator
49:44 - that people recognize you as being kind
49:47 - of like successful is at being able to
49:50 - transmit kind of like this high level or
49:52 - or technical stuff in a approachable way
49:55 - and that's what I think that people
49:57 - really appreciate and what if you can
50:00 - what can you extract
50:02 - from your experience that might be that
50:06 - people might be able to kind of like
50:08 - translate and incorporate into their own
50:11 - I don't know yes difficult questions I
50:14 - mean one one thing I would say is that
50:16 - it's always helpful for me when I get
50:17 - feedback from people saying oh the way
50:19 - that this was or something this didn't
50:21 - make sense to me or this did and I'm
50:22 - kind of accumulating that knowledge and
50:24 - iterating so I think that having some
50:26 - kind of dialogue and feedback system is
50:30 - certainly a part of the prop I mean for
50:33 - me I you know I would and it's hard to
50:39 - you know I would learn things the best
50:43 - once I had to teach them so I think it's
50:46 - kind of having that a you have to check
50:49 - I don't know what the right way to
50:50 - phrase this is because but you know I
50:52 - think maybe if I just think about this
50:54 - kind of trigonometry stuff for a setup
50:56 - for a moment like this might have been
50:59 - stuff that when I was first learning to
51:00 - code I was kind of using and sort of
51:02 - understand but until I had to explain it
51:06 - to somebody I didn't feel like I maybe
51:08 - understood it myself I understood it in
51:09 - a new way once I had to explain it to
51:11 - someone and I spent a lot of time just
51:14 - helping people individually and that's
51:16 - actually still my favorite as much as I
51:18 - love doing this YouTube stuff and it's
51:20 - kind of like insane and and interesting
51:21 - and this weird thing that's kind of
51:23 - happened to me for my life but I the
51:24 - thing that I enjoy most is like
51:26 - one-on-one helping people with code
51:28 - stuff it's just so and I think that's
51:30 - where I am as a student I was always
51:32 - helping other students so I think this
51:34 - one thing I would say if you want to get
51:36 - started and think about teaching teach
51:38 - to one person you know that's like a
51:40 - really good comfortable and interesting
51:42 - and rewarding place to start practice
51:46 - like I mean I'd see be like I I I don't
51:49 - know if I taught this course where I
51:51 - machine learning is kind of like this
51:52 - field that I'm trying to figure out if I
51:54 - can teach and I tried to do a course at
51:56 - ITP in the spring that I felt was kind
51:58 - of a total mess and I hadn't experienced
52:01 - that for a while because it's kind of
52:02 - doing the same thing over and over again
52:03 - so it's to remember that you have to do
52:06 - things more than once and get kind of
52:08 - practice and figure works yes
52:12 - and you can shout it out if reliable all
52:26 - right yes so this is a really good
52:29 - question also I'm all sorts of
52:31 - conflicted confused feelings about this
52:33 - so I'd like to try to explain this as
52:35 - transparently as I can so on the one
52:37 - hand I'm lucky to have this full-time
52:40 - job that allows me to experiment in
52:42 - weird directions working at NYU so it
52:44 - allows me to have the time to do stuff
52:46 - like this without it being like a
52:48 - primary source of income at the same
52:50 - time I you will notice that I do have
52:52 - ads turned on on the videos and I Drive
52:54 - a small income from that and I have this
52:56 - patreon which is like a Kickstarter but
52:58 - like a monthly thing so I'm interested
53:00 - in experimenting with these models in
53:02 - number one to learn about them do is its
53:05 - earning the extra money is useful I also
53:08 - use the money I'm rip Matt mentioned
53:10 - matcha here and some other people who I
53:12 - sometimes can get to work on different
53:14 - projects putting it back into the
53:16 - channel I've been trying to figure out a
53:18 - system for paying guests honorariums so
53:21 - in a way I kind of stumbled into this
53:23 - small business and a you know at this
53:27 - point it's really a small small business
53:29 - but it might grow beyond that and I
53:32 - haven't figured how to manage that side
53:36 - it's a side project that I maybe do once
53:39 - a week I'm just I feel like lucky if I
53:41 - made a few new video but that other boob
53:45 - creators they do really do this
53:46 - full-time and it's a whole there's a lot
53:49 - to worry about and figure out and
53:50 - YouTube you know I also feel conflicted
53:53 - about using YouTube as a platform it's
53:55 - been great for me and I've reached a new
53:56 - audience that I never knew was there but
53:59 - it's also a very specific audience of
54:01 - people who want to youtube and that
54:02 - comes with the limitations and so and
54:05 - how to make the videos more accessible
54:08 - more broadly and how to create financial
54:10 - sustainable models that I can continue
54:13 - this that other people could also do
54:14 - this is definitely something I'm
54:15 - interested in
54:16 - I hope that answers the question so far
54:18 - yeah yes
54:20 - so I've heard a lot of different
54:24 - subjects most recently being she
54:26 - learning I was kind of just wondering
54:28 - two things
54:29 - hey have you decided what you're gonna
54:31 - do next
54:32 - be what drives you to choose the
54:34 - subjects is it feedback etc yeah so at
54:39 - the moment mostly I make my decisions
54:41 - based on like things that come up in
54:42 - class that week so I teach on Tuesday
54:44 - and Wednesdays and then I livestream on
54:46 - Friday and I usually like I'm scrolling
54:48 - down notes of like oh I didn't get to
54:49 - this or this injury
54:51 - so I'm trying right now it just sort of
54:53 - works best for my life like alignment as
54:55 - much as possible
54:56 - over the summer I had planned to kind of
54:58 - like branch out into machine learning
55:00 - and kind of got tripped up there I had
55:03 - my school accidents I didn't mean to
55:05 - make a pun there we go but so I kind of
55:08 - fell behind on that I guess I'm what one
55:11 - of the things that I'm really trying to
55:13 - do is make sure that the tutorials and
55:16 - channel are watchable for the beginner
55:19 - kind of always so it doesn't mean every
55:21 - video if you've never learned program
55:23 - before you just walk in and like watch
55:25 - it but there's some sequencing and
55:27 - there's some different levels but to me
55:30 - that's the thing I really try to keep in
55:31 - the back of my hand because some of the
55:32 - loudest voices at least in getting
55:34 - suggestions and comments of what people
55:36 - want me to cover I think are people who
55:39 - have more experience or making a before
55:40 - feel more comfortable requesting or
55:42 - asking so it's hard to find that but I
55:44 - know that there's I know that there's
55:46 - quieter voices out there who are who
55:48 - want and enjoy and learn from the really
55:51 - beginner stuff so I'm really would love
55:55 - any suggestions or ideas on how to
55:56 - better manage kind of like choosing a
55:57 - contact but I think I probably supposed
55:59 - to wrap up I don't see like somebody
56:01 - right because I don't know if anybody
56:02 - has their eye on the schedule but maybe
56:05 - I'll take one more question I me there
56:07 - are no more questions
56:08 - oh yeah
56:13 - your channel in the first place yeah
56:17 - well first first I was recording my
56:20 - actual physical classes and I thought
56:23 - well what if I record those and students
56:25 - could watch them back if they miss class
56:26 - or in the evening or something and that
56:28 - didn't really work it was an interesting
56:30 - document but it wasn't it didn't have
56:33 - didn't work to watch unless you were in
56:35 - the class basically and they were long
56:38 - and they were messy and then there I was
56:39 - worried about privacy and other people
56:41 - in the video so then I started making
56:43 - some videos just for my courses and just
56:48 - trying it out and trying different ways
56:50 - of doing it and at one point I think I
56:54 - had made like I looked this up the other
56:56 - day I don't know some of these are
56:57 - private and unlisted videos but there's
57:00 - over 600 videos on my channel it was
57:02 - kind of insane but I think at one point
57:04 - I had made a hundred videos I was mostly
57:06 - putting them on Vimeo and somebody said
57:09 - emailed me and said I really like to
57:10 - watch this on youtube because they have
57:11 - the 2x teacher by the way if you watch
57:13 - me at half speed
57:13 - my kids were six and nine their favorite
57:16 - things to watch me die laughing I don't
57:19 - think they play rugby night sound really
57:21 - drunk or something it's very bizarre
57:23 - like be on half speed but anyway
57:25 - somebody want to watch them at the
57:27 - faster speed which Vimeo didn't have and
57:29 - so I just dumped the catalog there and
57:30 - you know YouTube has more of a system
57:33 - for people to find videos based on
57:35 - whatever and so at some point I thought
57:38 - I would try live-streaming
57:39 - somewhere in there you can find this
57:40 - like livestream number one test you can
57:44 - watch that where I was trying to figure
57:45 - out I think it's actually a Google
57:46 - hangout is what it is look like I'm
57:48 - gonna screen sharing and stuff like that
57:49 - so it just was a step by step kind of
57:53 - thing yeah I probably made the first
57:55 - video tutorial though after I had been
57:57 - teaching for like seven or eight years
57:59 - it was
58:00 - like I was doing this from the beginning
58:01 - great I think I see people like coming
58:03 - in which by means we're especially the
58:05 - by the way the best part of today I
58:06 - think that's gonna be these lightning
58:08 - talks for people in the community I was
58:09 - looking at the list and seeing all this
58:10 - exciting stuff so I definitely don't to
58:12 - take any time that could be 3:40 yeah
58:15 - but we should probably give 10 minutes
58:16 - for people to get said about stuff so I
58:17 - think our time is good if you didn't get
58:19 - us kur I'm like the merchandise person
58:23 - first all you should there's processing
58:24 - stickers I put some coding train
58:25 - stickers out there I know people like
58:27 - stickers so that's only why I mentioned
58:28 - them not because you need to take a
58:29 - sticker it's okay not bigger but I do
58:31 - have some extra ones in my backpack or
58:33 - something people are looking Sixers and
58:34 - up or to hearing any feedback or and
58:36 - that sort of thing so thanks everybody
