00:00 - in this video I want to look at how you
00:03 - can use JavaScript to create HTML
00:05 - element Dom elements on the fly in code
00:09 - so what happened in the previous video
00:10 - if I if i run this p5.js project you can
00:14 - see here there are some there's a
00:16 - there's an h1 element there's a
00:18 - paragraph element and there's a canvas
00:19 - where did those things come from
00:21 - so the clips in the previous video I
00:24 - looked at how in in the HTML file you
00:29 - can add things inside body like this h1
00:31 - element gets added and appears on the
00:33 - page this paragraph elements gets added
00:35 - and appears on the page but there's a
00:39 - canvas on the page I don't see the
00:40 - canvas here so how did that canvas get
00:43 - added the way that canvas got got added
00:46 - was in JavaScript
00:47 - create canvas 200 200 so if you want to
00:51 - have things already on the page that you
00:54 - want to sort of like manually set their
00:56 - layout and content you can put that
00:58 - stuff in the HTML file if you want your
01:01 - code to generate elements you can
01:03 - generate those elements from your p5
01:05 - file and in this scenario I'm generating
01:08 - just the canvas now incidentally you
01:11 - could certainly manually add a canvas as
01:14 - a tag and access it from JavaScript but
01:20 - this is not something that I'm really
01:21 - doing in these videos I want to sort of
01:24 - focus on the the canvas is kind of where
01:26 - p5 is kind of like a special case in and
01:30 - create canvas using p5 is kind of a nice
01:33 - way of just quickly getting the case off
01:34 - to the page that aside what I want to
01:36 - look at is what if you want your code to
01:39 - make the paragraph or what if you want
01:41 - your code to make that header element
01:43 - and of how does that work so you can see
01:46 - to make the canvas I said create canvas
01:50 - magic erased whiteboard because I had a
01:53 - technical difficulty but now I'm back
01:54 - here so what I'll do here now is make a
01:56 - list of some of these other create
01:58 - functions so you know that there is
02:01 - create canvas this makes a canvas appear
02:08 - on the page and then there are several
02:11 - other create blank func
02:13 - available P 5gs to add other kinds of
02:16 - HTML elements so here are a few create P
02:22 - create div create button create image
02:30 - IMG the list goes on and on and on and
02:33 - on so in the in the description of this
02:37 - video when I upload it I'll add a link
02:39 - to the dom reference where you can see
02:42 - all of these is a list of all these
02:44 - functions so let's now now a couple
02:47 - things about this all of these are going
02:50 - to need some sort of argument that goes
02:53 - in here and it's going to be different
02:55 - so what do you need to create a
02:56 - paragraph versus what do you need to
02:58 - create a button create sliders a really
03:00 - interesting one that I would like to get
03:01 - to at some point but let's start off
03:03 - simply with just create P ah and I
03:07 - forgot sort of a crucial detail but
03:08 - let's start off with create P and I'll
03:11 - come back to that detail so right here
03:13 - and set up after create canvas I'm going
03:15 - to say create P this is you know what's
03:20 - something besides I don't know my
03:22 - favorite color is purple sometimes it's
03:27 - pink every once a while it's like orange
03:29 - but mostly it's purple you guys need to
03:32 - know this about me okay now here we go
03:36 - and look at this look at that there's
03:38 - another paragraph on the page and I may
03:43 - be a little bit too excited about this I
03:44 - don't usually drink coffee nights of
03:46 - coffee today that idea um so here you
03:49 - can see here's the header then I put in
03:51 - the HTML h1 tag here's the paragraph
03:53 - that I put in the HTML here's the canvas
03:57 - that I created with JavaScript and
03:59 - here's the paragraph that I created with
04:00 - JavaScript so there's a big question
04:01 - here which is why would I do one versus
04:04 - the other and I think what we can do
04:06 - what I could do to answer that question
04:07 - right now is just say just breathe
04:08 - right now it doesn't really matter but
04:10 - at one place put it the other place who
04:12 - really cares
04:12 - um you just want to like experiment play
04:15 - around get stuff happening on the page
04:17 - as I show you s'more and more examples
04:19 - as we go through more and more scenarios
04:21 - I think there will the that question the
04:23 - answer to that question will reveal it
04:24 - themselves the answers were real
04:27 - sells but in other words different
04:29 - scenarios there could be advantages to
04:31 - why you might want to generate some Dom
04:33 - elements on the fly you know maybe
04:35 - you're randomly picking different texts
04:38 - maybe you're making a thousand of them
04:40 - right versus whether you want to like
04:42 - set some stuff up in advance so that's
04:43 - sort of like an important topic I want
04:45 - to revisit that question over and over
04:46 - again right now I just want to see that
04:48 - both are possible okay
04:50 - so and and we can do some weird things
04:53 - like I can add function like I don't
04:56 - have to just do that in setup I can add
04:59 - in the mousepressed function right the
05:00 - mousepressed function which fires
05:02 - anytime I click the mouse anywhere on
05:04 - the page right any time I click look I'm
05:09 - getting another paragraph and I can
05:10 - scroll down we can see and I could start
05:12 - to do things like you know my favorite I
05:16 - could say my favorite number is and then
05:20 - give a random number between 0 and 10
05:23 - and we give myself a little more room
05:27 - here right now I'm going to run this and
05:29 - you can see click click click I get a
05:31 - different random number and so this is a
05:34 - reason why I might want to generate
05:37 - those elements in JavaScript because I
05:39 - want the number to be random because I
05:41 - want to do it when the user clicks the
05:42 - mouse so I don't know how many times the
05:44 - Jews are going to click the mouse
05:45 - whereas I'm answering the question now I
05:48 - know that at the top I just wanted to
05:50 - say I am making a video so I can put
05:51 - that in the HTML in advance there's no
05:53 - reason for me to create that in
05:54 - JavaScript so this is this balance that
05:56 - we need to strike so create canvas
05:59 - create P there are other ones create
06:03 - button create image creative I my
06:05 - suggestion to you might be just try like
06:06 - adding them in your code see what
06:08 - happens but I do want to emphasize
06:09 - something in this particular sketch
06:12 - there is an h1 element at the top I'll
06:16 - see getting exercise here there is no
06:19 - create h1 function in p5 now you could
06:25 - say to yourself like what why not isn't
06:27 - that an oversight shouldn't there be a
06:28 - create I really think that should be a
06:29 - create h1 and you could have this
06:31 - discussion but I think the point is p5
06:34 - includes some create X functions for the
06:37 - sort
06:38 - common Dom elements you might want to
06:40 - generate with code there are a lot of
06:43 - kind of HTML tags
06:44 - there's list tags and ordered list tags
06:46 - and under unordered list typing it would
06:49 - be unrealistic and would sort of bloat
06:51 - the reference to have a create plan for
06:53 - every single kind of HTML element for so
06:55 - in all other cases you can always say
06:58 - create element to create element
07:01 - function allows you to make any Dom
07:03 - element any HTML element and the first
07:05 - argument is the tag itself and the
07:08 - second argument is you know the content
07:10 - that goes inside that tag so let's look
07:13 - at adding that right now here if I come
07:15 - back in setup I can say create element
07:22 - h1 and then I can say my favorite
07:28 - numbers below and now when I run this
07:34 - you can see I made this header in a Java
07:40 - Script I made the canvas then this h1
07:43 - element and now every time I click the
07:44 - mouse I get one of the paragraph
07:46 - elements below so this is what's
07:48 - possible for you now you can this this
07:51 - JavaScript code is sitting is loaded
07:54 - into this page it runs as soon as the
07:56 - page loads the page has some content
07:58 - built into it and then JavaScript add
08:00 - some content to it it adds a canvas it
08:03 - adds an h1 element and add some
08:05 - paragraphs so I think I'm going to stop
08:09 - this end so what I would say to you now
08:11 - is in for your next exercise take the
08:14 - sketch you made before with a few dumb
08:16 - few things in the HTML now try adding
08:19 - some HTML elements from p5 itself using
08:22 - these p5 functions and the next video
08:24 - I'm going to show you some tricks for
08:26 - how to manipulate those elements have
08:28 - them change and do some things on the
08:31 - fly ok so I'm going to stop now and stop
