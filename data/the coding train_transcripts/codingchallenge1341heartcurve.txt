00:00 - (train horn tooting)
00:01 - - I love you! (laughs)
00:04 - I'm here to make some mathematical hearts,
00:07 - look at these formulas, if
you plot these formulas,
00:09 - you get a heart, I mean what
could be better than that?
00:11 - This one here might be my favorite,
00:13 - although this one here is kind
of interesting, look at this.
00:16 - So we could try any of these,
00:18 - but I actually want to try something
00:19 - a little bit different here, I mean
00:20 - I'm looking at this, and I
know what formula they are so,
00:24 - what I'm about to do is in
no way magic whatsoever,
00:26 - but I want to try to get a
little bit of an intuition
00:29 - for why that crazy formula
makes a heart shape,
00:33 - and how you might,
basically, design your own
00:37 - parametric equations to
generate different patterns,
00:41 - so there are a variety of
different techniques for this,
00:43 - oh look, rotated cardioid,
oh I love the cardioid.
00:47 - I have a whole video about the cardioid,
00:49 - and we could just graph the cardioid
00:50 - just with like one
minus sine of theta, uh!
00:53 - So many ways we could make the cardioid.
00:55 - But, let's go to
processing, my happy place,
00:58 - my love, my true love, processing.
01:00 - Can I put like emojis in the comments?
01:05 - No, I cannot put emojis in
the comments, it's so sad!
01:10 - What did we do before there were emojis?
01:12 - Like, this right?
01:15 - Okay, now that we've
gotten that out of the way,
01:17 - that was very important, let
me go back to the curve thing.
01:21 - So, first thing that I want to do is,
01:22 - this is going to be a
lot easier if I think of
01:26 - everything as oriented around
the center of the window,
01:30 - so I'm going to translate,
the origin's in the top-left,
01:33 - I'm going to translate to the center.
01:34 - By the way, this channel, I shouldn't
01:36 - call it the Coding Train,
I should just call it,
01:38 - Here's Another Example of Things
01:40 - You Can With Polar Coordinates. (laughs)
01:43 - Like basically every
video I make is the same.
01:44 - But, maybe that's the theme for this week,
01:46 - so now what I want to do
is I want to loop around
01:50 - all of the points of a circle.
01:52 - You'll see why in a second,
I want to basically,
01:55 - I want to say, for float
a, which stands for angle,
02:00 - I'm going to start at zero,
I'm going to go all the way
02:02 - up to two pi and I'm going
to go by some increment,
02:04 - I'm going to pick that arbitrarily,
02:05 - although there might be reasons
02:06 - why I want to pick different
increments at some point.
02:08 - So I'm going to have every
angle from zero to two pi,
02:12 - and I'm also going to make
up a variable called r,
02:15 - which is kind of like radius,
02:16 - let's just set it to 100 right now.
02:18 - And I'm going to say, once again,
02:20 - here we go, sing it with me, it's the
02:23 - ♪ Polar to Cartesian coordinates song ♪
02:27 - Autotune and the internet
will fix that for me.
02:30 - R times cosine of the angle,
02:32 - y equals r time sine of the angle.
02:35 - What I want to do here is
I'm going to say no fill,
02:38 - and stroke 255 and begin shape
02:41 - because what I want to do is
create my own custom shape
02:45 - based on all of these points
02:46 - oriented around the circular path.
02:49 - Hopefully this will all start
to make more sense to you,
02:51 - so then I can call vertex, x,
y, and then I can say endShape
02:56 - and I can run this, and you
have this, a circle, ta-da!
03:00 - I have made a circle, the circle,
03:02 - and by the way, if I would've changed
03:04 - this increment value to
something much higher,
03:08 - you can sort of, well let's
make it much more extreme.
03:14 - You can see here like, I'm
actually just moving around
03:17 - the edges of a circle,
and if I thought more
03:20 - carefully about like two pi divided by six
03:23 - then I might have a hexagon,
03:24 - all sorts of possibilities
like that right?
03:26 - Two pi divided by six, there we go,
03:32 - nice little hexagon there, but
this is not what I'm doing.
03:36 - I am just tracing the
contours of the circle.
03:38 - Now, here's the thing, I can start to
03:42 - futz with these equations for example,
03:45 - what if I wanted IT to pinch a little bit?
03:48 - So interestingly enough,
what if I say like,
03:50 - cosine of a times cosine of
a, let's see what that does.
03:54 - Oh, weird, so you can
see what that's done,
03:56 - squaring the value, so it's kind of
03:59 - squishing it a little
bit along the x-axis,
04:02 - but of course, everything's
on the right side
04:04 - 'cause if I square a
negative I get a positive.
04:06 - But I could go to the third power,
04:08 - so why don't I say power
of cosine of the angle,
04:12 - to the third power, look at this,
04:15 - so you could see that even just doing that
04:17 - gets me this diamond-like quality.
04:21 - So that, could that's really working
04:23 - for the bottom of the
heart, in a way that's
04:26 - the bottom of the heart, but
I need to change the top.
04:27 - So I need to think about
what I'm doing with the y,
04:30 - so again, I'm just kind of,
this is very, in many ways,
04:32 - similar to my Fourier
transform epicycle of videos,
04:38 - they're like conceptually tied here,
04:39 - in that I'm messing with
the oscillating values
04:43 - as I move around this
kind of circular path.
04:46 - Now, let's do something
else like let's say,
04:49 - well what if I take sine,
and for the y value,
04:56 - what if I kind of multiply itself
05:01 - by sine of the angle, but have
like the frequency doubled?
05:08 - So if I do this, right?
05:11 - Well that's interesting, look
05:12 - what kind of shape I get there, hm.
05:15 - What if I multiply it by like
a much more extreme amount,
05:22 - like five, whoa look at that.
05:24 - So things are starting to happen.
05:26 - And probably actually
what would be much smarter
05:29 - for me to try to visually
demonstrate this,
05:31 - I have to think about
this, would be to animate
05:33 - the process of this and actually show
05:35 - the separate Xs and Ys moving,
05:37 - similar to the Fourier transform videos.
05:40 - Alright I think it's time for me probably
05:41 - to just put the formula in.
05:43 - It's sort of interesting to explore
05:44 - the different possibilities here,
05:46 - but ultimately, if I'm
seeing this equation,
05:49 - what I want is, these
interesting numbers right?
05:52 - Well I'll get to that in a second.
05:54 - But let's do cosine of t,
oh minus, minus, minus!
05:57 - I don't want to multiply
this stuff together,
05:59 - losing my mind here, so
I want to subtract out,
06:02 - ah yes, so as I'm getting
to the top, depending,
06:05 - okay so this makes
sense, so let's actually
06:07 - put this stuff in, let's
change this to cosine,
06:11 - let's change this to sine right?
06:13 - No let's change this to sine, sorry,
06:15 - let's change this to cosine,
'cause I've already done that.
06:18 - And then I'm going to say cosine
and this is like I've got,
06:21 - a two, a three and a four.
06:24 - Two, minus a three, minus a four.
06:34 - So we can see what's going on here,
06:35 - but, I need to, you can
see that it's now actually
06:38 - a little bit more squished at
the bottom than at the top,
06:41 - and so what might be interesting here
06:43 - is to think of you know this as,
06:45 - well if this is r then maybe
I want r time two times this.
06:52 - Whoa, look at that, because
now when it comes (mutters)
06:54 - but you can start to see the
heart oh but it's upside down.
06:57 - So I kind of want negative
one times the whole thing
07:01 - because of the way the
processing coordinate system is.
07:05 - We can see look, I'm kind
of getting a heart there
07:07 - but I've gone too extreme, so,
07:09 - I should probably get rid of this r thing,
07:11 - let's just make r one and
use the actual numbers.
07:13 - So, the actual numbers in the
formula are 13, five, two.
07:17 - So I can say, 13, five, whoops,
07:27 - five times, oh, 13, five, two,
07:34 - and then cosine of four a, just has,
07:37 - is not multiplied by any factor.
07:39 - So now if I do this, put too
many parentheses here, this,
07:45 - there we go, now look, there's the heart
07:49 - oh muah, I love you heart! (laughs)
07:53 - And then, now I can
scale it up by a factor.
07:57 - I mean I could just
use the scale function,
07:58 - but I could have you know,
basically scale it by 10,
08:02 - and I could say negative r times that,
08:04 - and there we go, so now
we have made the heart,
08:07 - let's animate it, this one's very silly,
08:08 - my whole like trying to
walk into this formula,
08:10 - really I just want to like look it up,
08:12 - but let's animate it, let's have it
08:13 - trace the path of a heart,
'cause that'll be really nice.
08:16 - So what I'm going to do
now is I'm going to create
08:19 - an array list of P vector objects,
08:27 - so if I were doing this in JavaScript,
08:29 - this would be a much
simpler just plain array.
08:31 - And then, what I'm going
to do is I am going to
08:36 - not have this loop anymore but rather
08:38 - have a global variable called a,
08:42 - and I am going to do the same exact thing.
08:49 - But I'm going to say here,
did the for loop, sorry,
08:54 - the for loop will be for every Pvector,
08:59 - v in the heart, draw
vertex at v dot x, v dot y.
09:06 - And then, what I'm going to
do is each time through draw,
09:12 - I'm going to make a new vector,
09:15 - I'm going to say, heart
dot add new Pvector
09:22 - at some x and y and then I'm going to
09:26 - increase the angle by a little bit.
09:32 - So here we go.
09:37 - Muah, bing!
09:42 - (claps)
Yay!
09:45 - Okay, so I made a heart, with math!
09:48 - I mean this makes me so happy.
09:49 - Ah, my artistic talent is not existent,
09:54 - but let's at least make the
stroke weight a little thicker.
09:57 - Let's add a fill, so I'm going
to give me a nice red color,
10:04 - and I feel like it should
be like a little bit more,
10:06 - a little darker and a little pinkish,
10:08 - so let's try that, and let's make sure
10:12 - I add close here so it closes the shape.
10:16 - Whoa, oh look at that, oh no no no no no.
10:18 - I do not want close, I
specifically do not want close.
10:23 - Yes, that's what I want and
now we are making this heart.
10:32 - Yay, I made a heart! (laughs)
10:36 - (train horn tooting)
10:37 - So I challenge you to go and look at
10:42 - these other formulas and try them.
10:44 - Simon Tiger has shared with me
10:45 - a ton of other formulas, maybe I'll see
10:47 - if any of those I want to try but,
10:49 - you find a formula and
make your own heart,
10:51 - could you do it in 3D?
10:53 - I bet you could make a 3D
heart, all sorts of stuff,
10:55 - and share that with me.
10:58 - Coding hearts, hashtag
coding hearts, coding love
11:02 - for this wonderful, any day of the year,
11:04 - we could be makin', we
should be makin' hearts
11:07 - all day of the year, no reason
11:08 - to just do it in February
when it's cold outside
11:10 - and there's like snow
and sleet and everything,
11:12 - anyway I love you, thanks for watching
11:14 - the Coding Train, and I'll see ya soon.
