00:00 - hello and welcome to part five of my
00:03 - p5js sound tutorial series now in this
00:06 - particular video I'm going to look at
00:07 - adding sound effects to a P5 sketch we
00:10 - looked at playing like a a song in a P5
00:12 - J sketch and starting and stopping it
00:15 - and and manipulating it but what happens
00:17 - if you have something like uh a snake
00:19 - game so this is a uh an example I made
00:22 - in a previous video where you can play a
00:26 - snake game meaning the whoops um you
00:30 - move about the screen as the snake and
00:32 - you try to gather up food and as you
00:34 - gather up food your snake becomes longer
00:37 - um and now so what would it mean to add
00:39 - sound effects to this particular sketch
00:42 - so I have a few ideas I made a list over
00:44 - here um the first thing I want to do is
00:46 - just add two sound effects so a sound
00:49 - effect for each time you eat the food
00:50 - and a sound effect for each time you
00:52 - have to start over when you run into
00:53 - yourself um I also want to add some
00:55 - background music and I want to look at
00:57 - seeing what happens could we manipulate
00:59 - the background music having it speed up
01:00 - or slow down based on like how far
01:02 - you're getting in the game and then also
01:04 - there's an issue that comes up with
01:06 - working with sound effects if you have a
01:07 - sound effect that you're triggering many
01:09 - times over and over again um so I want
01:11 - to look at that and maybe we'll add a
01:12 - sound for changing direction so I'm
01:13 - going to do all of that in this
01:14 - particular video now where am I going to
01:17 - get my sounds from so there's lots of
01:19 - places on the internet which you could
01:20 - find sounds um this is a particular
01:23 - sound effects package um I will link to
01:26 - this particular sound effects package it
01:28 - has a Creative Commons license it's
01:30 - available on GitHub I've already
01:31 - downloaded has wonderful sounds in it
01:33 - that were made um for uh this for the
01:36 - coding rainbow Channel specifically so
01:39 - um you can see here this nice page I can
01:41 - just test out what some of these sounds
01:43 - sound like for example this isting
01:46 - rainbow with
01:50 - me okay so um I already have all these
01:53 - sounds downloaded and so what I'm going
01:55 - to do is go to the Finder right here and
01:56 - this is my this is my p5js sketch I have
01:59 - a library folder and I have two
02:00 - JavaScript files and an index at HTML
02:02 - file what I want to do I think is to is
02:05 - make a folder in here whoops I'm in the
02:07 - wrong place I want to make a folder
02:09 - called
02:10 - sounds and then I'm actually just going
02:12 - to take all the sounds from that sound
02:14 - effects package um and copy them into
02:17 - here I'm not going to use all of them so
02:19 - now you can see it with my project I
02:22 - have my JavaScript
02:24 - files my HTML files and now also this
02:27 - folder of sounds and you can see um like
02:30 - if I'm going to start with one of these
02:31 - alerts you can see how they're named
02:32 - alert d04 MP3 so this is going to be
02:35 - really important because I'm going to
02:36 - need to reference the file name
02:38 - specifically when loading the sound so
02:40 - let's just make sure first I can do that
02:42 - so I'm using the the there's a variety
02:45 - of different sound formats you can use
02:46 - which are supported by different
02:47 - browsers and I'm not going to get into
02:50 - that in this video I'm just going to use
02:51 - MP3 files which will hopefully work in
02:54 - most scenarios so let's say I want to
02:56 - try this uh let's try alert number six
02:59 - so the first thing I want to do is uh go
03:02 - to my code and I want to create um let's
03:05 - make this the sound effect where you eat
03:07 - the food eat sound and I'm going to add
03:10 - the preload function I think what I
03:13 - might like to do in a separate video is
03:15 - show you how if you have a lot of sounds
03:17 - show you how to create a loading
03:18 - animation um right now the the this um
03:22 - it's just going to take a minute for not
03:24 - a minute but take a few seconds for the
03:25 - sketch to load and I'm going to say eat
03:27 - sound equals load sound and then now
03:30 - this is the name of the sound
03:32 - file but but I also need the path right
03:35 - if that was just in the root directory
03:37 - this would be enough but I think it said
03:38 - sounds and then
03:41 - alerts I think that's right let's go
03:43 - back and look uh sounds and then alert
03:46 - and it's with a capital A and with no s
03:49 - so this type of stuff is typically case
03:51 - sensitive and you've got to get the
03:52 - spelling exactly right so just to see if
03:55 - this works I'm going to uh go back to
03:58 - the sketch
04:00 - and I should be able to just say right
04:01 - here eat sound.
04:03 - playay so that that's working so in the
04:06 - console I have it as a global variable I
04:08 - can just play that sound so this is
04:09 - actually really easy stuff here I've
04:11 - loaded the sound all I need to do is now
04:14 - find the place in the code where I eat
04:15 - the food so that actually happens right
04:18 - here in draw there's a function the
04:20 - snake function checks to see if it's
04:22 - eaten the food and then it calls this
04:24 - pick location which picks a new location
04:25 - for the food and so I could just add
04:27 - here and say eat sound playay so now
04:32 - when I run this sketch oops oops I have
04:35 - to click in it
04:37 - to you can see there we
04:42 - go it's
04:45 - working all right so that's the basic
04:47 - idea here so now we need another sound
04:50 - effect let's let's add a second sound
04:52 - effect effect um and let's pick one uh
04:57 - let's uh for when you
05:01 - uh for when you
05:03 - die uh how about this
05:08 - one so I'm going to this is under voice
05:12 - so I'm going to uh uh say start over
05:17 - sound and I'm going to load that one as
05:21 - well and this one is in uh where was it
05:25 - sounds voice and then cartoon laugh
05:31 - and now I should be able to say okay
05:32 - well where in the code this function
05:36 - s.de that's what checks to see if the
05:38 - snake
05:39 - dies uh and here this is where this is
05:43 - where all the reset of the snake happens
05:45 - you can see I'm logging to the console
05:47 - so I can say here uh uh what did I say
05:51 - start over sound. playay so
05:56 - now I should be able to eat food
06:05 - and eventually I'm going to make
06:11 - myself so you can hear one the trick I'm
06:13 - doing to ah this is a very I'm not very
06:16 - good at playing this game
06:21 - uh okay so you can see that work so this
06:23 - is the basic idea all you need to do is
06:25 - load sound and call play at the
06:27 - opportune
06:28 - time um now actually right now what I'm
06:31 - going to do is I'm going to add another
06:32 - sound for change direction so let's go
06:34 - back and pick which sound we want to do
06:37 - let's use I want a shorter
06:39 - [Music]
06:41 - sound
06:43 - uh these are all pretty
06:46 - hello hello let's say we wanted to use
06:49 - this hello sound for every time I change
06:52 - direction so I want to just emphasize a
06:55 - point here so I'm going to um in the
06:59 - sketch I'm going to
07:02 - say hello and I'm going to say uh oops
07:07 - hello equals load
07:11 - sound and I forget this one is in voice
07:16 - hello1 um and I'm going to say there and
07:20 - so uh sound slvo now I should I should
07:24 - say that you know generally speaking I
07:26 - would probably try to avoid spaces in
07:28 - your sound file names it's all working
07:30 - just fine here but sometimes file pads
07:32 - on different machines and different
07:34 - servers spaces can confuse things but
07:36 - it's going to work just fine but I if I
07:38 - were you know I might rename some of
07:40 - these files just to like this to make it
07:42 - easier to work with but for right now
07:43 - it's working so I'm not going to worry
07:45 - about it so let's say what what I'm
07:46 - going to do now is anytime I press a key
07:50 - I'm going to say hello. playay so you
07:53 - know I could have a different sound for
07:54 - each direction there's all sorts of but
07:56 - I just want to like show you something
07:57 - that comes up a lot with sound effects
07:59 - so I'm GNA run
08:07 - this so you can see with the way this is
08:10 - working when I call
08:12 - play it always restarts the sound
08:16 - immediately but does and doesn't let it
08:17 - finish playing which might be what you
08:21 - want but if I wanted to make sure it's
08:24 - not it doesn't play the song The Sound
08:28 - until uh until it finishes playing if it
08:31 - always finishes playing the sound um I
08:33 - can
08:35 - say I could say if hello is is not
08:39 - playing so there's a function in the P5
08:41 - J Library called is playing which
08:44 - returns true or false based on whether
08:47 - the sound is playing so if I say if it
08:49 - isn't already playing then play the
08:52 - sound oops I missed something here
08:56 - oops now what you can see is
09:01 - hello it's actually kind of a long sound
09:05 - Soo so I can hit the keyboard as many
09:07 - times as I want but it won't actually
09:09 - start the sound over again until it
09:11 - completely finishes and there's a lot of
09:12 - Silence there because the sound file
09:13 - itself has a nice long sort of Fade Out
09:15 - in it now I wanted to mention something
09:18 - that I'm pretty sure is the case and I'm
09:20 - going to look in the sound reference for
09:22 - a
09:23 - second
09:25 - um and I think uh what I want to look
09:30 - for
09:34 - is there's something time out back I was
09:38 - looking for what I found what I was
09:40 - looking for which is the play mode
09:41 - function so actually I didn't realize it
09:43 - let's go back to the example I want you
09:44 - to listen very carefully I'm going to
09:47 - press the key multiple
09:50 - times it's a very short sound so it's
09:52 - hard to hear but it's actually always
09:54 - finishing playing hello and layering the
09:57 - sound over itself multiple times this is
09:59 - actually what's known
10:01 - as the play mode uh
10:06 - sustain so sustain is the default play
10:09 - mode meaning if you trigger a sound
10:10 - multiple times it's going to layer over
10:12 - itself many times but if you didn't want
10:14 - that you could actually um you could
10:17 - actually change the play mode to restart
10:19 - and I'll you'll be able to hear the
10:21 - difference now I'm going to refresh this
10:24 - page so you can hear it doesn't every
10:27 - time I press the key it doesn't finish
10:29 - the previous
10:31 - sound which is perhaps not what I want
10:34 - here it's a little bit
10:36 - awkward H um and perhaps that's not the
10:40 - best sound so I'm going to take that out
10:43 - but I wanted to demonstrate that this
10:44 - comes up a lot you know in my flower
10:46 - Invaders code example there's a thing
10:48 - where you hit the space bar and you
10:50 - launch water so if you were hitting the
10:51 - space bar a lot you might want to think
10:52 - about how you layer that sound um okay
10:56 - so I'm going to comment out this hello.
10:58 - playay and let's let's look at what we
10:59 - have right now so we have the game here
11:02 - and a sound is played every time you eat
11:06 - a piece of
11:07 - food and
11:09 - then by the way I think I have a hack in
11:12 - here where I can just make it longer so
11:14 - now also when you go into yourself it
11:16 - laughs at you so I can click the
11:20 - mouse actually I want to make that the
11:22 - spacebar I just have a hack in here so
11:24 - that I for testing which just like
11:27 - increases so I'm going to just say if
11:30 - key equals spacebar I think that'll be
11:32 - easier for me to do the testing so um so
11:36 - I can just really quickly like make a
11:37 - long snake and hear that sound okay so
11:42 - now what I want to do now is add some
11:44 - background music so I have some nice
11:46 - there is a some music here so music
11:49 - music 01 MP3 so let's also load
11:53 - that uh VAR music and I'm going to say
11:57 - uh music equals Lo uh I'm going just
12:00 - copy
12:01 - this music equals load sound sounds
12:05 - music and then
12:09 - music-1 and then what I want to do is
12:11 - say music. playay as soon as the game
12:15 - starts so
12:17 - now we've got our snake game which I'm
12:20 - going to now
12:27 - play
12:30 - I forgot that I was making a tutorial
12:32 - video because I'm just interested in oh
12:33 - I could watch it over here too okay so
12:36 - the point is now you see that I have
12:37 - background music playing and you could I
12:38 - could put a button here to toggle the
12:40 - background music but I want to try
12:42 - something which is just to see could I
12:44 - make the game faster with each piece of
12:46 - food you eat and then also have the
12:48 - music speed
12:49 - up so um so what I'm oh I forgot that
12:53 - the okay so I'm gonna mute this tab for
12:55 - a second I should add a play pause
12:58 - button but I'll I'll do that later okay
13:00 - so now what I want to do is um the now
13:03 - the speed of this game I I've done it in
13:06 - kind of a tricky way which is that I'm
13:08 - just actually control typically this is
13:09 - a bad idea the speed of this game is
13:12 - tied precisely to the frame rate because
13:16 - so nothing could happen faster in the
13:18 - animation because the whole frame rate
13:20 - is so I probably if I needed to have
13:22 - other animations and things would want
13:24 - to not mess with the frame rate but this
13:26 - will work just fine and it'll
13:27 - demonstrate the idea so thing I want to
13:29 - do is make that a variable so I'm going
13:30 - to make that a variable called frame
13:32 - rate I'm going to start it pretty slow
13:33 - I'm going to start it at
13:34 - three and I'm going to I'm GNA also put
13:38 - in draw the frame rate
13:41 - function uh uh and actually you know
13:45 - what I don't need to put it in draw I'll
13:46 - put it in uh I'll do this more properly
13:49 - I'll put it in
13:50 - setup and then I'm going to adjust the
13:53 - frame rate every time the food is eaten
13:57 - so I will call frame rate again in here
13:59 - and I'll also say something like frame
14:01 - rate Plus+ so it's going to go and just
14:03 - to be sure it's working I'm going to
14:05 - change this by like 10 frames per second
14:07 - each for each piece of food right
14:10 - now so it's
14:12 - slow and then you can see it's really
14:14 - fast so I don't want it to change that
14:17 - extreme so I'm just going to change it
14:19 - by two and then now that I need that see
14:22 - that that's working let's also say
14:25 - music. rate or was it what was it I
14:27 - forgot what the I forgot what the
14:29 - function is let's go look in the
14:31 - reference um so I want the uh P5
14:34 - reference page for sound file and you
14:38 - can see that the function
14:40 - is uh rate sets the playback rate of a
14:44 - sound file will change the speed in the
14:46 - pitch values less than zero reverse the
14:48 - audio buffer so I'm assuming for example
14:50 - if I say rate of two it's going to play
14:52 - it twice as fast so what I think what I
14:54 - want to do is I want to say um uh music
14:58 - rate
15:00 - map the frame rate which has a range
15:03 - from three I started at three to like
15:05 - maybe it's going to go up to 20 I don't
15:08 - know uh to between one and three times
15:13 - as fast so and then I'm going to change
15:15 - the music rate to that music rate so
15:17 - let's see how that works right
15:19 - now so I'm going to go back to the
15:22 - game and oh I need to unmute the
15:27 - tab
15:34 - oh and by the
15:35 - way when I start over something I need
15:38 - to correct when I start
15:41 - over going crazy I can't mute it really
15:45 - easily I wish I could I you know what I
15:47 - can do is I can at least refresh the
15:48 - page so it's when I start over somewhere
15:51 - in
15:52 - here um I also need to say music. rate
15:57 - one so that that the music uh goes back
16:01 - to
16:01 - one and the other thing is that rate
16:04 - really picked up fast so I'm going to
16:06 - make the mapping much much more less
16:11 - extreme and probably I don't need to do
16:13 - this as a mapping maybe what I should
16:15 - just do
16:16 - is uh make a variable called music rate
16:21 - this might make more sense and have that
16:23 - equal to
16:25 - one and
16:27 - then forget about doing a mapping just
16:30 - set the music
16:32 - rate and
16:34 - then just increase it by like a little
16:37 - bit like 1%
16:39 - faster for each time a piece of food is
16:42 - eaten so let's play this again
16:52 - ready can you hear it getting
16:57 - faster
17:01 - I'm terrible at this game if anybody's
17:03 - actually just watch watching YouTube
17:05 - Make Me bobbing my head awkwardly in
17:07 - like playing this game I'm really
17:09 - impressed okay you get the idea that's
17:12 - that 01 was like very little so you know
17:14 - I should probably make it at least like
17:16 - 05 for anything should
17:27 - happen
17:31 - this really what my life has
17:34 - become rainbow snake game with music
17:36 - speeding up okay you guys get the idea
17:38 - okay so this is the end of this video I
17:40 - showed you how to load a bunch of sound
17:42 - effects how to put music in the game how
17:45 - to dance with the music how to make it
17:47 - speed up I think I I think I've got to
17:49 - everything on my list I don't uh I'm I
17:52 - feel like I need to like fade this out I
17:54 - don't know how to fade the Audio I need
17:55 - to like build that into the code but I'm
17:56 - just going to mute the tab and Say
17:57 - Goodbye and I we'll be making more sound
18:00 - uh the next set of sound tutorials I'm
18:02 - going to make are actually about sound
18:03 - synthesis so I won't be loading any
18:04 - files at all um and then I also want to
18:07 - make one at some point remind me if I
18:08 - haven't done this if it's not on the
18:09 - channel maybe one that shows if you have
18:11 - a ton of sounds how to have like a
18:12 - loading bar or something like that um as
18:14 - your program uh starts up okay thanks
18:16 - for watching and I'll see you soon
