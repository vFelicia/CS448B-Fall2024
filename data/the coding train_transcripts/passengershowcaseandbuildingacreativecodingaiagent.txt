06:14 - me
06:16 - uh how's everybody doing can you hear me
06:18 - okay I'm about to get started
06:23 - [Music]
06:26 - here had a few little technical hiccups
06:29 - right before I was about to
06:32 - start and I'm just checking one more
06:36 - thing
06:38 - here oh boy okay hold on we're going to
06:40 - turn on this
06:43 - X
06:46 - and three two
06:49 - one ah good morning oh my oh my good
06:53 - morning hello uh happy Sunday on the
06:56 - coding train uh yes you hear me okay I
07:01 - um have a little screen here where I'm
07:03 - looking at the chat I'm I'm I'm
07:06 - strangely uh uh or I think as usual
07:09 - somewhat under uh prepared here but I'm
07:13 - happy to be here live with you I have um
07:15 - this stream will go until approximately
07:17 - 12 noon Eastern which is an hour and 53
07:22 - minutes from now uh the first question
07:26 - that I have for you please let me know
07:28 - in the chat
07:30 - where you are watching from one of my
07:33 - favorite things about hosting the coding
07:36 - train here on YouTube is discovering so
07:39 - many viewers from all over the world um
07:42 - I have this desire maybe uh at some
07:44 - point for a future time maybe if I
07:47 - retire from my uh teaching job at NYU I
07:50 - would like to travel the world and visit
07:53 - every single one of you there's so many
07:55 - places I have never been uh and so so um
08:00 - let me know where you're watching from
08:02 - um Finland is in the house you know my
08:04 - son uh that is oddly enough one of his
08:07 - number one I mean maybe it's not odd
08:10 - that is where he always says like let's
08:12 - go to Finland when we talk about where
08:13 - we going to go on vacation this year
08:16 - Finland um Charlotte North Carolina
08:20 - Germany Nepal Korea India strawberg
08:23 - Hungary Algeria Sweden Morocco Germany
08:27 - Brazil Mexico California it's snowing
08:31 - Meek wuk Village California Jeff that
08:34 - sounds uh where in California is that
08:36 - Algeria Nairobi Kenya this is incredible
08:40 - see this is why I asked the question um
08:42 - this is one of the things that um is
08:45 - just wonderful about the community is
08:48 - how Global it is um so many different
08:51 - experiences and backgrounds and points
08:53 - of view that you all bring and I see L
08:56 - is coming from France Whirlwind says
08:59 - Antarctica I would like to believe that
09:01 - that's true and I don't mean to be
09:04 - skeptical but I wonder uh Lithuania
09:08 - Lithuania is where my well thank you
09:10 - mooner from Syria uh thank you for that
09:13 - support um Lithuania is where my
09:17 - grandfather um was
09:19 - from uh interestingly enough
09:22 - okay um my all of my grandparents are
09:25 - immigrants to the US mostly from Eastern
09:28 - Europe areas I could talk about that if
09:31 - people are interested at some
09:32 - point
09:35 - um uh Whirlwind was joking okay thanks
09:38 - for that clarification but if there's a
09:39 - scientist hold up in a some type of lab
09:43 - in Antarctica with the coding train on
09:46 - well that would be it I would be done
09:49 - end scene coding train is over um close
09:53 - to yosity interesting wonderful so the
09:55 - other important piece of information
09:57 - that I would like to know from all of
09:59 - you is how is my audio um I have been
10:02 - working hard to update drivers fix
10:05 - settings I have a empty room which is
10:09 - very echoey I have a a nice high quality
10:12 - lav mic here which I could get really
10:14 - close to and speak into um but um it's
10:19 - not this room is not sound treated but
10:21 - I'm using Nvidia broadcast which is a
10:23 - piece of software I can run on the
10:24 - streaming PC uses the graphics card and
10:27 - a machine learning model to remove the
10:29 - Reverb so um I'm curious how that sounds
10:33 - in the past uh it has uh there there has
10:37 - been glitching clicking and popping so
10:39 - let me know if you hear
10:43 - that great thanks everyone um so I've
10:46 - I've got a pretty good close uh look on
10:48 - the chat here uh I've got my monitor
10:51 - over here so I can see what I'm doing
10:55 - let's yes uh and some of you I know deom
11:00 - made a a comment here in the Discord uh
11:03 - around that there was not the deafening
11:05 - whistle in the opening animation I muted
11:08 - the audio that is a part of that video
11:11 - I'll have to still some glitching uh let
11:14 - me know if other people hear the
11:15 - glitching oh occasional
11:20 - CLI I don't understand so this is really
11:24 - odd let's think about this let me just
11:27 - explain something to you I spent a
11:31 - couple days ago hours in this
11:34 - room recording the video with exact
11:36 - recording a video um you can see what is
11:40 - coming next on the coding Train by
11:42 - looking at this whiteboard here so I
11:44 - spent hours in this room recording the
11:46 - next coding challenge with the echo
11:48 - reduction on not a single click or pop
11:51 - in the
11:52 - audio and suddenly when I come here to
11:56 - stream live it's all of a sudden back
11:59 - why would that be the one thing that is
12:02 - different which kind of makes no sense
12:04 - to
12:06 - me is I'm
12:09 - running uh when I was recording that
12:11 - coding challenge I wasn't actually live
12:15 - streaming I didn't have I don't have
12:17 - they didn't have the soundboard hooked
12:19 - up why should that matter
12:21 - though I was running a different
12:24 - instance of OBS because I run multiple
12:26 - instances of
12:27 - OBS on my
12:30 - computer uh one has a bunch of settings
12:33 - for recording the dis one one has a
12:35 - bunch of settings for live
12:39 - streaming what could it
12:41 - be very
12:44 - frustrating yeah everyone's tell okay so
12:47 - you don't have to tell me anymore I'm
12:48 - aware so the question is uh I'm going to
12:51 - turn off the echo reduction and you can
12:53 - all tell me which is better very
12:56 - frustrating so I thought I was good
13:01 - hi yeah
13:04 - so let's just turn it off for a second
13:10 - um all right my audio is now
13:14 - without the
13:17 - crackling uh so a bunch of good comments
13:19 - one is 2001 Hearn says GPU is doing more
13:23 - work so some Hardware bug is getting
13:25 - triggered that's possible do you need
13:28 - multiple instances of OBS instead of
13:30 - just multiple profiles probably could be
13:32 - done with multiple profiles but I set it
13:35 - up this way a while ago sometimes I
13:36 - actually run both instances of OBS at
13:39 - the same time because I'm trying to
13:41 - record different things and do different
13:43 - things again probably unnecessary but
13:46 - that's my setup um it's definitely the
13:49 - cosmic rays
13:51 - yeah so I think probably the echo is uh
13:56 - better than the glitching so I'm going
13:58 - to just stick with the um echoing now
14:02 - it's also very cold I'm I'm quite
14:05 - frustrated with the world right now
14:09 - because it's my this week it's over now
14:11 - last week was my uh spring break from
14:13 - NYU where I uh have my teaching job and
14:17 - I I I had intended to use last week well
14:21 - I and in fact I sort of did so let's
14:24 - talk about uh some goals that I have I
14:26 - like to put these out there um
14:30 - and I'm sorry I'm uh I'm looking at the
14:33 - chat and thinking about too many things
14:35 - first of all welcome it seems like
14:38 - looking at the chat most of you are
14:40 - familiar with the coding train but I
14:42 - expect there might be some new viewers
14:44 - there uh out there uh maybe you're a
14:47 - little quieter if you are new if you've
14:49 - never watched the coding drain before
14:50 - but you somehow wandered in here please
14:53 - say hello in the chat I would like to
14:55 - know I would like to know where you came
14:57 - from how did you find this
14:59 - um but the coding train is a YouTube
15:02 - channel uh where I uh upload uh
15:07 - tutorials around learning to code in the
15:09 - so-called creative coding space so a lot
15:13 - of graphics and animation sometimes
15:16 - working with text but creative
15:18 - exploratory projects um a lot of physics
15:23 - simulation um some machine learning
15:27 - topics a lot of beginner friendly
15:29 - tutorials the kind of bread and butter
15:33 - of the coating train if you will are
15:35 - these coating
15:37 - challenges marser says first time in the
15:41 - live stream um so um my goal for
15:47 - 2024 is two new videos per month coding
15:53 - challenges uh and uh as well as at least
15:56 - one live stream per month so I was
15:59 - really all set to catch up I was like
16:02 - spring break I'm going to record a video
16:04 - I'm going to do a live stream um but uh
16:08 - I didn't it last week was it just like
16:10 - became so busy I barely got to anything
16:12 - but I did record the next coding
16:15 - challenge sneak preview of what is left
16:19 - over on the Whiteboard here uh this
16:21 - video will come out I want it to come
16:24 - out in March because then I would have
16:26 - gotten my two videos out in March but
16:29 - more likely it'll be early April not
16:32 - April 1st I don't have an April Fool's
16:34 - Day idea a few bunch of years ago I was
16:36 - like I got this idea for an April Fool's
16:38 - video I'm going to do a kind of parody
16:41 - of an old 1980 s Live
16:44 - sketch and I uploaded it to YouTube and
16:47 - nobody watched it small number of people
16:50 - watched
16:51 - it um so oh and nnn says recently
16:56 - admitted to ITP for fall 202
16:59 - 24 uh very excited to meet you um this
17:04 - fall nnn that's wonderful yes so if
17:06 - those of you aren't aware uh my um my
17:09 - day job if you will is teaching at a
17:12 - program called ITP an IMA in New York
17:15 - New York City in Brooklyn New York
17:17 - actually it's a a part program at Tish
17:18 - School of the Arts uh New York
17:20 - University soft body physics crashing
17:23 - Thunder says I watched it okay good so
17:26 - one person in the chat watched my April
17:28 - Fool's video anyway it's supposed to be
17:31 - spring break it's literally 20° fhe
17:34 - outside freezing in this room I had the
17:37 - heater cranked up but the heater is very
17:39 - loud so I like to turn it off when I'm
17:41 - streaming we'll see I might have to turn
17:43 - it on a little bit because I'm quite
17:45 - cold I do a little jogging here to warm
17:47 - up some jumping
17:49 - jacks uh um but so I'm very disappointed
17:53 - with my spring break uh which is just
17:55 - freezing I have this little cushion that
17:57 - I stand on just wearing socks though I
18:00 - should probably put on shoes my toes are
18:01 - getting cold I don't know all right so I
18:04 - gotta get a hop to it so what's gonna
18:06 - happen today I have a list of things uh
18:09 - look at me so organized for this live
18:11 - stream I uh let me get let me give you
18:13 - the agenda real quick just want to tell
18:15 - people about shift bot in case you
18:16 - aren't aware of it I want to talk about
18:18 - the passenger showcase and the recent
18:21 - coding challenges I've released um and
18:24 - how I am embarking uh um there's another
18:26 - train riding along Instagram so I'm
18:29 - going to talk about that I want to talk
18:31 - about Discord updates that are going on
18:34 - I already talked about my monthly goals
18:35 - and then I have a project to start
18:37 - working on so the project I'll just get
18:39 - to the project uh more recently um I
18:43 - used to more recently I've been using
18:45 - these live streams to try to work
18:48 - through uh different kinds of projects
18:51 - uh a lot focused on working with
18:54 - different kinds of language models and
18:56 - seeing what kind of shenanigans and
18:58 - experiment I can get up to so I have a
19:00 - project and I am soliciting for anyone
19:03 - who's interested this project it needs
19:06 - to be completed by April 14th I'll talk
19:09 - about what's happening on April 14th uh
19:12 - honestly I need to complete it like with
19:14 - a week before so I can practice with it
19:17 - um and uh it's going to be open source
19:19 - on GitHub so anybody who wants to
19:21 - contribute and help me make this thing
19:24 - uh you're you're you're
19:25 - invited
19:27 - okay
19:29 - so um first thing on my agenda I'm just
19:33 - going to briefly mention it uh if you
19:36 - hadn't seen I've been oh you don't see
19:38 - my screen uh if you hadn't seen this
19:41 - I've been working with uh some
19:43 - researchers at Google uh experimenting
19:46 - with their uh Gemini uh language models
19:49 - and I have made uh with them this goofy
19:52 - little uh p5js helper chatbot I don't
19:56 - know why it's not showing up I got maybe
19:58 - I got to turn it on on come on shift bot
20:00 - where are
20:01 - you there you are this little come on
20:04 - wake up you're very blurry and tired
20:06 - there you go there you go okay this is
20:09 - uh shift bot here in the corner uh who's
20:12 - a friendly little chatbot who um you can
20:15 - ask questions to like um what will be
20:21 - the next coating Challenge on the coding
20:24 - train let's see if shift bot can
20:28 - recognize I mean I just realized it I
20:30 - actually wrote what the coding challenge
20:32 - is on the top there so not too much of a
20:35 - mystery here but let's press enter and
20:37 - see what we
20:38 - get ah Peter Ferell fellow not oh oh I
20:42 - should update about the nature of code
20:43 - book uh that's a good thing to add to my
20:47 - list uh nature of code I got I want to
20:50 - mention that plug I am a robot and don't
20:52 - have access to that information but I
20:55 - can tell look shift bot knows what's on
20:58 - my agenda this is perfect because I need
21:01 - this link because I'm going to talk
21:03 - about the Discord thank you shift bot so
21:07 - anyway I did a whole stream where I
21:08 - played around with shift bot there's
21:10 - lots to say about it but I just wanted
21:12 - to uh what I'm really looking
21:14 - for and what my friends at Google are
21:17 - looking for is feedback and testing of
21:20 - it um I have heard from so many people
21:23 - that it's an ex that they're interested
21:26 - and um perhaps even been
21:29 - intrigued uh to see this uh experiment
21:34 - in a kind of custom
21:37 - bespoke chatbot assistant for Creative
21:40 - coding um and people are really
21:42 - interested in asking about how it was
21:43 - made and all sorts of questions but what
21:45 - I haven't really heard in is about
21:47 - people using it so I know that it's not
21:49 - available you have to join the weight
21:50 - list in certain countries you can't get
21:52 - it but if please join the wait list uh
21:55 - if you have access to it you should have
21:57 - got an email with like a there I think
21:58 - you can write
21:59 - to I I have to find the email there's
22:01 - like a a support email like support at
22:04 - shiot with Google I don't know somebody
22:07 - there's an email you can write to with
22:08 - your feedback uh and so please please do
22:11 - that
22:13 - um astop penguin writes did you become
22:16 - the coolest dad now that you are a robot
22:19 - no my kids have zero interest in this so
22:22 - like the like the ey rolling is at like
22:26 - the top height they height of their eye
22:29 - rolling Powers my teenage children are
22:32 - like uhhuh yeah uh cool robot right uh
22:37 - yeah
22:38 - no you might think that I'm cool H
22:41 - nobody in my
22:43 - family that they they know me as just
22:45 - like the loser that I am that that was
22:48 - too harsh I'm just you know okay uh what
22:53 - else do I want to say all right so I
22:55 - talked about that let me just go right
22:57 - to nature of code
22:59 - um uh so uh I'm going to go to natureof
23:02 - code.com okay so this is my uh book um
23:07 - called nature of code um you know the
23:10 - many of you might be familiar with it uh
23:13 - natureof code.com you can read
23:14 - everything about it but uh you can read
23:16 - all you can read the entire thing it's
23:17 - done I mean actually finished the
23:20 - website is not finished so this is
23:22 - mostly a placeholder design for the
23:24 - website uh hopefully in the next few
23:26 - months there'll be a whole new uh
23:28 - website design with some more features
23:30 - and different things um but this this is
23:34 - a a big expensive project that I worked
23:37 - on and um I would if you're interested
23:41 - oh and there you can uh actually buy the
23:44 - the hard cover and use the coupon code
23:46 - pre-order to get 25% off oh download
23:50 - look at this oh cool oh look at these
23:53 - now this is cool I this is new on there
23:57 - look at this some sample
24:00 - Pages this I love this page so this is
24:03 - one of the uh pages from the neural
24:05 - network chapter where I'm talking about
24:08 - a neural network that could be trained
24:11 - to predict the energy use of a home
24:14 - based on different uh properties and you
24:17 - can see this nice little illustration by
24:19 - Zanna Marsh of showing like a single
24:21 - family home a large apartment building
24:23 - so um and I guess we can download
24:26 - chapter
24:27 - 7 um here for free that's cool so please
24:32 - if you're interested of um in physical
24:34 - books uh you can pre-order this um today
24:38 - wherever books are sold as well as on
24:41 - the not I think you'll get the I think
24:43 - this 25% off is only available from the
24:45 - no starch website I have gotten a lot of
24:48 - messages from people saying oh the
24:51 - shipping is like you know too much or
24:55 - whatever so um if
25:00 - um the the book will be sold
25:02 - internationally through all the usual
25:03 - channels so if you're looking at this
25:05 - and you're like I can't get it in my
25:06 - country just wait uh it'll probably be
25:09 - available through a local uh retailer um
25:12 - at some point but maybe it just isn't
25:13 - for pre-order just yet okay so I
25:16 - mentioned that uh what
25:19 - else all right let's talk about
25:22 - something that is going on now uh I am
25:26 - going to take the next few months to to
25:28 - experiment a bit more with uh Instagram
25:31 - platform uh Karen who is a contributor
25:34 - to p5js is helping me with Instagram and
25:37 - we are launching a a um an initiative to
25:42 - feature passenger showcase projects on
25:44 - Instagram so if you go to uh you if you
25:48 - follow uh the coding train on Instagram
25:50 - at thee. coding.com
25:53 - um if you oh yeah yes pet so hold on a
25:59 - second I'm noticing this comment in the
26:01 - chat from Peter saying book frequently
26:04 - books are counterfeit so I haven't
26:06 - investigated this this is a huge issue
26:10 - happening right now I've um been
26:12 - listening some podcasts from different
26:13 - authors who have been lamenting the fact
26:16 - that there are a lot of these AI
26:18 - generated books uh self-published books
26:22 - which which again self the
26:23 - self-publishing there something that is
26:25 - a good thing nature of code was
26:26 - originally self-published I support and
26:29 - encourage people to self-publish but the
26:32 - the ability to publish quickly and
26:35 - easily and the ability to use generative
26:37 - AI has caused this issue with um you
26:41 - know counterfeit plagiarized or fake
26:44 - books and even these things like I've
26:45 - heard that a lot of popular books will
26:47 - then have these workbooks AI generated
26:49 - workbooks which are not made by the
26:51 - author but Amazon's algorithms will
26:53 - bundle them together anyway so if
26:56 - anybody sees
26:58 - um any counterfeit or uh fake versions
27:03 - of the nature of code out there feel
27:05 - free to let me know I'd be happy to I'll
27:07 - try to do something about that if I can
27:10 - the book is licensed under creative co
27:14 - uh creative commment so the book has a
27:16 - very permissive open- Source license um
27:19 - and you can uh read the entire thing for
27:21 - free online there's no reason the only
27:24 - thing you're not allowed to do is resell
27:27 - it I am the only person who can no
27:30 - starch really because I I'm working with
27:33 - them as the publisher who can sell it
27:35 - commercially also a lot of people have
27:38 - contacted me about doing a translation
27:40 - of the nature of code I'm
27:43 - actually uh uh now is the time to ask me
27:48 - about that so maybe write to danielthe
27:52 - [Music]
27:57 - codingtrabla would love the book to be
27:59 - translated into as many languages as
28:01 - possible and conceivably that is
28:04 - something that I could do on the website
28:06 - as well that if it's on the doing that
28:07 - myself but I'm more thinking about
28:09 - translations of the print book but maybe
28:10 - I should be thinking the other way
28:11 - around anyway back to Instagram I want
28:13 - to get to working on this project it's
28:14 - already 10:30 I'm getting very very very
28:17 - cold I had to do some running in place
28:20 - here I need one of those I I should get
28:22 - like go a treadmill here and I could
28:23 - just live stream while walking on the
28:25 - treadmill okay so
28:30 - um um so every two twice a month every
28:34 - two weeks you will find a post on
28:36 - Instagram that is highlighting a coding
28:39 - challenge uh most recently we
28:42 - highlighted the Souther automata coding
28:44 - Challenge number
28:45 - 179 um and it is uh when we highlight it
28:49 - it's a call for people to submit their
28:51 - projects to the passenger showcase so if
28:53 - you go to the coding tr.com and you go
28:56 - under Community under showcase case you
28:58 - can see here these are all the projects
29:01 - that people have submitted and Beyond
29:03 - just submitting them the point of this
29:05 - is for you also to look at and explore
29:07 - them because my videos just show you the
29:09 - nuts and bolts of a particular concept
29:12 - or algorithm without a lot of kind of
29:15 - creative
29:16 - interpretation and it is my hope that
29:19 - you the viewers will learn something
29:21 - from those videos and inspire you to
29:24 - make your own version and then the
29:25 - Showcase is a place for people to share
29:27 - those back and look at them so um under
29:32 - guides under passenger showcase guide
29:35 - there is a form here and I realize I'm
29:36 - kind of standing in front of it uh where
29:39 - you can submit your work um if you go to
29:42 - any particular video I'll go to the wolf
29:45 - one um then you can also see whoops I
29:48 - don't know what's going on there you can
29:50 - see the uh projects that are submitted
29:53 - for the wolf CA here so
29:57 - um so please um when you see the
30:00 - announcement on Instagram if you hadn't
30:02 - already watched the video it's a chance
30:03 - for you to go back and watch it uh and
30:06 - then you can submit then what we do and
30:09 - uh you know obviously unfortunately
30:10 - we're not able to share everyone's
30:12 - project uh but picking a selection of
30:14 - them you can see them here then um uh uh
30:18 - uh the now this is a selection of them
30:21 - that have been shared uh here's a nice
30:23 - collage of them and then um I'll just
30:25 - show you so this is the wolf Elementary
30:27 - CA rings I love this interpretation of
30:30 - taking the wolf from CA but uh rendering
30:32 - it in a radial pattern uh Kathy here
30:35 - made a version of the wolf from CA with
30:37 - these swirly designs that I absolutely
30:39 - love um this is a version of it with a
30:42 - different kind of rule that I think you
30:44 - could find if you that I didn't explore
30:46 - in the video itself but um coal has
30:51 - explored it uh and then this from Greg
30:53 - kaisman I wonder can I get the audio
30:56 - here hold on I have to turn this on
30:58 - on this is wild to me it's basically
31:02 - rendering the wolf from CA and each cell
31:06 - is a note and then so it's the wolf from
31:09 - CA is playing music really really
31:12 - incredible okay uh
31:15 - and uh here's one with uh adjustable
31:18 - parameters from Ruben King and uh a 3D
31:22 - one from con HF NZ so the other thing is
31:26 - when you are you don't have to to have
31:28 - an Instagram account not at all required
31:30 - but it's not if you happen to it's nice
31:32 - for us to be able to tag you so when you
31:35 - go to the Forum I've lost where it is uh
31:38 - guides passenger showcase guide um here
31:43 - um this is where if you enter your
31:46 - Instagram handle in here then we'll be
31:48 - able to uh if we're able to feature it
31:50 - on Instagram be able to tag you for that
31:52 - but that is um not at all um required I
31:56 - also by the way you know you there is
31:58 - this little box here on the offg you're
32:01 - submitting it to the website but you
32:02 - wouldn't want us to feature it somewhere
32:04 - else um you can check that box uh by
32:07 - private by the way I I have a bad habit
32:09 - of trying to put train buns everywhere
32:10 - in my materials if that bothers you then
32:13 - uh my
32:15 - apologies okay so I am probably so the
32:20 - um this literally just got posted
32:21 - yesterday um I think that for the next
32:28 - uh Instagram passenger showcase feature
32:32 - I am going to feature uh showcase
32:35 - projects from um from of the appoloni
32:40 - and Gasket so now is your chance to get
32:43 - your apponi and Gasket uh projects in I
32:46 - wanted to look at this one just live
32:49 - though th I I can't believe I didn't
32:51 - think to do this during my actual coding
32:55 - challenge video itself I don't know why
32:57 - this isn't loading yeah okay so what I
33:00 - love about this particular one is
33:03 - how it
33:05 - is uh the the actual original Orient so
33:09 - first of all what what am I even talking
33:11 - about if you missed it wasn't one of my
33:13 - more um this the appolloni and Gasket
33:17 - video which is this particular fractal
33:19 - pattern uh was one of the lower viewed
33:22 - challenges in recent months the sand
33:24 - falling one has you know exploded
33:27 - probably had 10 times the amount of Ed I
33:28 - don't know why I'm talking about this
33:29 - it's not that important but
33:32 - um uh my most recent coding challenge is
33:36 - the appoloni gasket it is a fractal
33:39 - pattern where circles are placed and
33:42 - then that are mutually tangent to each
33:44 - other and then smaller circles are
33:46 - placed mutually tangent to those and so
33:48 - on and so forth and you can see a
33:49 - beautiful rendering here in Trevor
33:53 - Sergeant's uh passenger showcase
33:55 - submission um there's lots of this on
33:58 - some level and I say this in the video
34:00 - to me this is uh you know if you wanted
34:03 - to learn about how to do recursive
34:05 - fractal patterns uh this is what I cover
34:08 - in chapter eight of the nature of code
34:11 - and in fact if I scroll down you would
34:14 - find uh you know a pattern like this
34:17 - which looks quite similar to the
34:19 - appolloni gasket in the sense that it's
34:21 - circles inside of circles inside of
34:23 - circles this particular
34:26 - pattern right here here is this much
34:29 - code I don't know what's that 15 20
34:31 - lines of code one recursive function
34:34 - very basic idea and oh this is uh anyway
34:37 - there's some bugs in the way the the
34:40 - comments are rendered here on the
34:42 - website but regardless of
34:44 - that I kind of thought oh the appolloni
34:46 - and Gasket will be not so uh will be
34:50 - like this but maybe a bit more
34:52 - sophisticated it turns out that the
34:55 - appoloni gasket fractal involves quite a
34:58 - bit of uh pun intended here complex math
35:01 - specifically around complex numbers
35:03 - that's why the video ended up being an
35:04 - hour long but if you're interested I
35:07 - would suggest please go back and watch
35:08 - that video what I love about this one
35:11 - here is the fact that the interaction As
35:14 - you move the mouse around you are
35:16 - arranging the original uh PL the
35:19 - placement of the original circles and I
35:21 - think this is very clever I love kind of
35:22 - going off to the edge and seeing these
35:25 - uh like this like Crescent Moon uh kind
35:27 - of pattern here just uh really nice I
35:30 - the gray scale looks like is mapped also
35:32 - to the original orientation so anyway
35:34 - this is a really really terrific
35:35 - interpretation thank you for sharing
35:37 - that um I look forward to sharing it on
35:40 - Instagram
35:42 - uh yes Circle inversions oh yeah this is
35:46 - circle inversions it's related to that
35:48 - is there I didn't I actually not have
35:49 - not seen this number file video that
35:51 - prep is referencing in the chat okay so
35:54 - that's what I wanted to talk about
35:56 - around the passenger showcase one thing
35:57 - I'll mention is when you submit the
36:00 - form it creates a poll request here and
36:04 - uh I think the this is a poll request
36:07 - from maybe you're in the chat uh the kid
36:10 - um this is your uh Angry Birds uh uh
36:15 - coding challenge submission which I have
36:16 - yet to look at so this is my fault it
36:19 - takes me sometimes like a week to get to
36:21 - reviewing these poll requests and
36:23 - merging them but I will be I will make
36:25 - sure to do that uh after the stream
36:28 - today but we can see there are a bunch
36:30 - there's one actually appolloni and
36:32 - Gasket one oh this is another ah this is
36:35 - actually the one I was looking for I
36:37 - just didn't merge it yet they're two
36:38 - Trevor and also Omar's so this also uses
36:43 - the mouse and look at it ah this also
36:46 - like the original orientation is
36:48 - animating in this rotating way this is
36:50 - wild so this is also this is what I was
36:53 - actually thinking of when I was looking
36:54 - at Trevor's I just hadn't merged this
36:57 - one yet
36:58 - so this is not on the website yet
37:00 - because if it's in the poll request uh
37:02 - CU then so it does take some time for it
37:05 - to PE appear we do moderate uh to make
37:07 - sure you know there's no inappropriate
37:09 - materials in the coding challenges and
37:11 - also I this you know I like to look at
37:13 - all of them so you know I don't read
37:14 - every comment on YouTube I don't read
37:16 - every chat message in the live stream
37:18 - but I look at every single passenger
37:20 - showcase a submission I should be so
37:23 - lucky to have so many that I can't look
37:24 - at them all anymore but um uh we uh but
37:28 - that's not the current state okay so
37:30 - that is me talking about oh I'm very
37:32 - cold the Showcase uh I might just turn
37:36 - the heater on okay
37:38 - everybody uh won't bother you so much
37:41 - and it but let's see if I can go a
37:43 - little longer without
37:44 - it okay so let me close some windows
37:47 - here let's talk about Discord
37:50 - oh so the the the primary platform for
37:54 - the coding train is YouTube uh as well
37:56 - as nebula should mention nebula don't
37:58 - forget about nebula so uh nebula if you
38:01 - go to uh go.
38:15 - nebula.com I really want um I have the
38:18 - opportunity to pitch a nebula original
38:21 - which could be a different something
38:23 - different than what I usually do on the
38:24 - coding train I'm still looking for an
38:26 - idea
38:28 - uh anyway so uh the nebula and YouTube
38:31 - are the primary platforms uh for the
38:34 - coding train um but the I would say the
38:38 - second most important platform for the
38:40 - coding train right now is the Discord so
38:43 - again if you go to the coding train.com
38:45 - and the other thing nobody responded to
38:47 - me here but I'm trying to decide I
38:50 - recently let me go to the website I
38:52 - posted an issue about this so if anybody
38:54 - has thoughts about this please uh pipe
38:57 - in
38:57 - but I recently was able to get uh when I
39:01 - originally was creating the coding Train
39:04 - website coding train.com was not
39:06 - available it recently came up available
39:08 - I had to spend $300 on it which is maybe
39:11 - maybe I overpaid I don't know but I feel
39:13 - like it's there I got to buy it 300 is
39:15 - not like insane so let me just get it um
39:20 - so uh so I have that domain now and I'm
39:22 - trying to decide right now if you go to
39:24 - Just coding coding tr.com
39:27 - will just redirect you to the coding
39:29 - train.com but I'm wondering if I should
39:30 - actually move the whole site to coding
39:32 - train.com if you have thoughts on that
39:34 - um let me know that's not the important
39:37 - thing here uh but the important thing is
39:40 - here is if you go to the coding tr.com
39:43 - Discord that will take you to this page
39:47 - uh which gives you all the information
39:48 - about the Discord you can see we are
39:50 - 10,000 Plus members strong apparently
39:53 - there's 2,000 members online this is a
39:56 - place where you can get help with your
39:58 - code um you
40:01 - can uh connect with other people in the
40:04 - community you can share what you're
40:05 - making you can get notifications from me
40:09 - which is what I'm going to talk about so
40:11 - you can join the server and I am going
40:14 - to go into the server now and look at
40:17 - some things that are
40:19 - new okay so first of all uh Noob Dev 54
40:23 - who I think is in the chat oh and Nicole
40:26 - is there hi Nicole I have I have the
40:28 - chat here
40:31 - um the cold 314 people live pie people
40:35 - live okay I gotta turn the heat what do
40:37 - you think I should turn the heater on
40:38 - properly right why is it so cold it's
40:42 - supposed to be spring break
40:46 - no I feed my dog Gloria pickle outside
40:51 - because if I feed her inside she often
40:54 - we have cats she tries to eat the cat
40:55 - food so last night it rained overnight I
40:58 - went to get Gloria's Bowl which I had
41:00 - left outside and the bowl was a block of
41:03 - ice it was full of completely frozen
41:07 - water
41:09 - okay um
41:12 - so what am I talking about here ah yeah
41:15 - so Noob Deb thank you so uh uh Kobe that
41:18 - many of you might know uh from the
41:21 - Discord was the manager of the Discord
41:23 - for many years thank you Kobe for your
41:26 - incredible service to the coding train
41:28 - Community uh uh Kobe has moved on from
41:32 - managing the coding train Discord uh
41:34 - onto New Opportunities and Adventures
41:37 - and noobde 54 has now taken it over so
41:41 - one is uh nubd has been doing a lot of
41:43 - work to reorganize the channels rename
41:46 - roles um if you have ideas and things
41:49 - you'd like in the Discord please uh send
41:52 - them to nodev um and also you can always
41:56 - tag at station manager that is the group
41:59 - of moderators volunteer moderators if
42:02 - anybody would like to volunteer to help
42:04 - moderate the coding train community in
42:06 - Discord and on YouTube uh you know that
42:09 - there may be a possibility for us to add
42:10 - more moderators as well um David Smith
42:14 - asked what languages are discussed on
42:16 - the Discord well there's no restriction
42:18 - I assume you're talking about
42:19 - programming languages there's no
42:22 - restriction as to what languages uh you
42:25 - can or cannot discuss I would say
42:27 - because I'm tending to use processing
42:29 - and p5js and nodejs and different
42:32 - creative coding Frameworks that's kind
42:33 - of what you what I see more people
42:36 - talking about but I can go poke around
42:37 - the channels there's different uh you
42:40 - know people are talking about other
42:41 - things and you're you're welcome to okay
42:44 - so um what do I want to say the here is
42:47 - so when you join the coding train
42:50 - Discord there's a new onboarding
42:53 - process um and the I think the thing
42:57 - that I want to mention the most so you
42:59 - can go up here and look at the server
43:01 - guide so the server guide will kind of
43:03 - give you a bunch of links uh talk you
43:06 - know you obviously there's some
43:07 - crowdfunding stuff if you want to join
43:09 - that you can um there's a Code of
43:11 - Conduct um but what I would say the most
43:15 - important thing for me to feature here
43:17 - is here under channels and roles so even
43:20 - if you're already in the Discord if
43:21 - you've been in the Discord for a long
43:23 - time go click on channels and roles
43:26 - because because if you want to get the
43:29 - notifications I might still use I will
43:32 - so I've been using at everyone which
43:34 - pings everybody in the server I am
43:37 - moving towards a model where I will only
43:39 - use that for really critical urgent
43:42 - announcements maybe no more than once a
43:44 - month but for like today's live stream
43:48 - or a new video or just some interesting
43:50 - thing that I want people to test out um
43:53 - if you want to get notifications then
43:57 - if you click on this little button here
44:00 - under the customization question um then
44:05 - that will give you the signal bell roll
44:08 - which um you can get a notification so
44:10 - if I were to go right now under um I
44:14 - don't know where to put this I'll just
44:16 - do go under
44:18 - announcements uh where you can see I
44:20 - posted I did at everyone yesterday to
44:23 - post about this live stream uh if I
44:26 - click at sing Bell hi to everyone whoops
44:30 - hi to everyone oh my my hands are cold I
44:33 - can barely type watching right
44:37 - now I can't type watching right now you
44:40 - can't even see what I'm typing because
44:42 - it's at the bottom there okay um I don't
44:45 - need to publish that okay so you will
44:47 - get those um notifications so I wanted
44:51 - to mention that there's some other
44:53 - things let me just see uh I I I made a
44:56 - list of them them here I think so ah so
45:00 - we removed a bunch of old rolls we
45:03 - renamed renamed some roles so red cap is
45:07 - another role that you could have for
45:09 - yourself if you're interested the Red
45:12 - Cap role um I don't know if this is just
45:13 - a us thing but in Amtrak The Helpful
45:16 - people who helpful help you with your
45:18 - luggage on the train are wear the Red
45:20 - Cap so that's why it's not a MAG hat I
45:24 - just realized hopefully no one gets in
45:27 - confused with that anyway I can't
45:28 - believe I even like said that but it
45:30 - popped into my head okay uh the Red Cap
45:33 - role is for people who are generous
45:36 - helpful members of the community um who
45:39 - have just been around and are are help
45:41 - answering people's questions so um uh
45:44 - track crew uh Community Caboose is for
45:47 - the uh there's some private channels for
45:49 - those of you who are subscribing to the
45:51 - membership on YouTube or patreon but the
45:53 - signal Bell that's the important one um
45:57 - there's a new role for conductor
45:58 - ameritus for uh folks that have worked
46:00 - on the coding train but no longer are
46:02 - removed a bunch of channels and revised
46:04 - the onboarding process
46:08 - okay I
46:11 - think all right all right I'm gonna turn
46:14 - the heater on let's put on a little
46:18 - music give myself a little break here
46:20 - wait what happened to the
46:24 - music weird oh there now it's going
46:27 - [Music]
46:31 - I wonder could the clicking be Rel no
46:34 - it's makes no sense all
46:37 - right turn the heater on
46:48 - woo to be honest the heater it's less an
46:54 - issue it's less an issue and it takes a
46:57 - bit for it to realize it needs to turn
46:59 - on it's less an issue
47:02 - for um you watching like a little noise
47:06 - in the background and I could try
47:07 - putting on the noise
47:09 - reduction
47:12 - um it's very loud and it makes me start
47:15 - to like speak really loud and then I
47:17 - start to wear out my voice but you know
47:20 - signal Bell signal Bell signal Bell
47:23 - Rock that's really good I like that do
47:26 - have a nice warm drink here some little
47:28 - warm coffee here in the morning people
47:30 - always surprised to hear that I drink
47:32 - coffee they're like isn't that dangerous
47:33 - for you you're already such
47:39 - a ah the heater has come on
47:45 - okay uh all right the heater is on I
47:50 - could other I could um I'm just looking
47:53 - over here at
47:55 - my um
47:59 - oh you know what I have the noise
48:00 - suppression on so the OBS noise
48:03 - suppression is on so you probably don't
48:04 - even hear
48:05 - it wait could that be
48:08 - causing wait a
48:11 - second I think I might know what's
48:14 - causing the glitching I have OBS filters
48:17 - audio filters
48:20 - on anyway I'll just investigate that
48:23 - later can everybody hear me now you
48:25 - don't hear the heater
48:28 - okay hi vivec thank you uh and happy
48:32 - holy Festival of Colors
48:35 - okay let's
48:38 - I let's take
48:43 - well I think you know my brain is
48:45 - starting to freeze all right let's get
48:47 - started working on this project that I
48:49 - want to work on um I don't have a lot of
48:52 - Ambitions for today my goal is to um get
48:58 - a very
48:59 - primitive um Visual Studio code
49:02 - extension running so I'm GNA talk about
49:05 - what this project is and all the things
49:07 - I want to build for it but to be clear
49:10 - if you're trying to decide you want to
49:12 - stick around for the next hour of this
49:13 - live stream or go on with your day what
49:16 - I'm going to look at and I've never done
49:17 - this before so I have no idea how to do
49:19 - it you're going to watch me try to
49:21 - figure this out as we go is build a
49:24 - visual studio code extension because
49:26 - because the project that I want to make
49:29 - is a AI agent that codes in visual stud
49:34 - Studio code um automatically without any
49:38 - intervention um and I am doing this not
49:41 - for the purposes of actually making
49:44 - something useful but for entertainment
49:46 - purposes only so um many of you uh if
49:50 - you watch the coding Trend I know this
49:52 - from looking at my YouTube analytics one
49:54 - of the things you can see is like what
49:55 - other videos are viewers of your channel
49:57 - watching so I do know that many of you
50:00 - watch the you YouTube channel uh standup
50:03 - maths from Matt Parker and Matt Parker
50:07 - runs something called an evening of
50:11 - unnecessary uh detail
50:16 - whoops uh which is um he's been doing it
50:19 - and here we go oh that's scheduled twice
50:23 - one in August as well oh uh
50:28 - so
50:30 - um uh Matt Parker has two of these I I
50:33 - didn't know about this one so but I
50:35 - assume it's right if it's on the bellous
50:36 - schedule Matt Parker is hosting two of
50:39 - these in Brooklyn New York uh at the
50:42 - Bell House 1497 street it's actually
50:44 - very very close to
50:46 - well it's not really where I live in
50:48 - Brooklyn but it kind of is where I live
50:49 - in Brooklyn I don't really live in
50:50 - Brooklyn anyway the point is uh I will
50:54 - be uh performing in China quotes um at
50:58 - this uh night uh Sunday April 14 I think
51:02 - it's sold out already maybe there's a
51:04 - way to get tickets uh in the future but
51:06 - if you already have tickets um yes Devon
51:09 - I want to make my own uh Devon AI but
51:13 - silly um and so this is my idea I think
51:16 - I only I think I'm doing like a
51:18 - 10-minute I think all the guests um it's
51:20 - Matt parker host the evening it's um um
51:23 - on the website let's just click on this
51:28 - um it says I don't think my name is
51:31 - listed here but uh how do I uh sold out
51:38 - follow view event details let's see but
51:41 - so but apparently Grant Sanderson from
51:45 - three blue one brown and Emma Haruka
51:49 - ewow now I'm wondering this when I saw
51:53 - this name when I saw Emma heruka ew's
51:56 - name
51:57 - on this page my head exploded with
52:01 - excitement I don't know if you all know
52:04 - who this is but this is the world record
52:09 - holder uh the person who has written an
52:12 - algorithm a piece of software to compute
52:15 - the most digits of pi ever so I'm very
52:19 - excited to see whatever she is
52:20 - presenting about
52:23 - um and uh my idea AA is to do a little
52:29 - competition so imagine I'm going to set
52:31 - the scene for
52:33 - you you know uh imagine um that I'm up
52:38 - on stage and I have Visual Studio code
52:40 - in front of me and I I might probably
52:44 - have to pick something in advance but in
52:45 - a in a sort of dream world to get a
52:48 - prompt from the audience like program a
52:50 - fractal tree and then I set
52:54 - my coding train a agent
52:58 - working and I start to work and we have
53:01 - a little 5 to 10 minute competition with
53:04 - a little banter back and forth to uh
53:08 - create a fractal tree uh with p5js
53:12 - so you know one option that I have been
53:14 - thinking about is to create something
53:17 - like and I don't know why shift bot
53:18 - keeps going away like shift bot uh shift
53:21 - bot is a Chrome extension and um yeah
53:25 - funny Devon AI yes so shift bot is a
53:27 - Chrome extension and shift bot can uh
53:30 - kind of operates within the P5 web
53:33 - editor but I thought as an experiment
53:35 - for this maybe I would actually work
53:37 - with a visual studio code extension um
53:40 - and perhaps I could even create so my
53:45 - thinking is that with Visual Studio code
53:47 - I might be able to have two window panes
53:49 - open one where I'm coding one where it's
53:52 - coding and two like even preview windows
53:55 - with like a local server so you could
53:57 - watch them both so let's talk about um
54:00 - let me just make a list this a little
54:02 - silly just to use well let's create a
54:05 - gith let's create so I want to make a
54:06 - list of the features so that's the idea
54:10 - the idea right now is to make a Devon
54:15 - like AI coding agent but one that
54:19 - is um maybe a little bit I don't know I
54:24 - don't know what its personality should
54:25 - be just yet but I want it to have
54:27 - personality and I don't necessarily need
54:30 - it to be efficient or good at its job it
54:33 - just needs to and I probably will
54:35 - artificially slow it down because I want
54:38 - it to move at the speed of typing
54:40 - otherwise I think it might be unfair but
54:43 - I don't want it to just like spit out
54:44 - the code I want it to be able to you
54:48 - know write some code think about it talk
54:50 - about what it's doing edit the code run
54:53 - it that kind of thing so uh to really
54:56 - ulate the creative coding exploratory
54:58 - full process so what I would like to
55:01 - build today I kind of think that I won't
55:04 - be putting in I don't think it's
55:06 - realistic in the next
55:08 - hour
55:09 - um for me to sort of
55:12 - build you know I might fine-tune train a
55:15 - custom AI model for this I just want to
55:19 - get a basic VSS code extension running
55:23 - that can uh uh type code into a text
55:28 - file and run that code in a preview pane
55:32 - that's my starting point um so I want
55:35 - just the skeleton of this so let's
55:39 - begin uh let me go to uh
55:45 - terminal um and actually I I would like
55:48 - to do this with a local on device model
55:50 - so my goal is to not use any model in
55:53 - the cloud although I we'll see um and
55:57 - for that um some options I'm thinking
55:59 - about are using uh
56:02 - olama um which is a way of running llama
56:04 - locally on a Mac another option is using
56:06 - something called local
56:08 - AI um which is a way of hosting a bunch
56:11 - of models locally on your Mac and then
56:14 - another option is use Transformers JS
56:17 - which is a way of running machine
56:18 - learning models in JavaScript local on
56:21 - device models so those are those are
56:23 - some my options uh so let's go to let's
56:26 - start we're I'm going to start this
56:28 - project I need a name for it too
56:36 - um whoops no no no I'm not uh make
56:40 - directory uh what's a pun what's a good
56:43 - pun with Devin but would be like coding
56:48 - train
56:51 - related coding train
56:54 - related uh pun I don't know
56:57 - I I'll name it later
56:59 - uh Devon Chuchu why was it called Devon
57:04 - in the first
57:12 - place um
57:16 - okay so
57:19 - let's get this going here so the first
57:22 - thing I'm going to
57:24 - add is a read me
57:28 - file I'm so glad I turned the heat on by
57:30 - the way and I'm going to let
57:32 - co-pilot GitHub copilot work with me
57:35 - here conductor Devin
57:42 - yeah conductor yeah oh Dev in that's why
57:47 - it's okay anyway I we I'll get a good
57:49 - name for it
57:50 - later um all right so
57:55 - um
58:00 - okay so here's what I need um
58:03 - autoedit
58:06 - autorite code into uh sketch. JS so I'm
58:11 - just making a list of features that I
58:13 - need um narrate its
58:18 - process of writing the
58:22 - code look at errors and fix bugs
58:28 - which is that's kind of and that's
58:30 - really sort of
58:35 - like
58:37 - uh so
58:42 - incrementally
58:43 - preview uh pane to show uh p5js
58:50 - canvas and with auto refresh Okay so
58:56 - these are uh core
59:01 - behaviors
59:03 - um uh audio I don't know what to call it
59:07 - um
59:10 - intera features so it should uh use
59:14 - whisper to listen to what I am
59:18 - saying
59:21 - uh narrate and talk and an narrate the
59:25 - process
59:26 - answer banter with
59:29 - me uh using a text to speech
59:33 - model oh it should also be able to uh
59:38 - receive canvas as
59:42 - input to look at what I am making okay
59:46 - so these are all the uh so that's more
59:49 - of a AI feature okay and then
59:54 - uh ml model okay so probably a
60:01 - fine-tune a model these are questions uh
60:06 - retrieval rag with nature of code book
60:10 - or other coding train challenge
60:14 - examples um and
60:17 - multi modal so it can look at the uh
60:24 - canvas okay
60:27 - Dev out it's a zealot about commenting
60:30 - every single
60:32 - line uh
60:34 - okay no so D I'm I'm just trying to get
60:38 - started in this project and to be honest
60:40 - like I'm gonna be working on this mostly
60:43 - not while live streaming although this
60:45 - is motivating me like it's this is three
60:48 - weeks away this is very
60:52 - ambitious so um really what this is is
60:57 - is uh Bizarro
61:01 - Devon um so but this is just my list of
61:03 - features so my goal for today honestly
61:06 - if I could just get a Visual Studio code
61:09 - extension that's Auto writing code into
61:11 - sketch. JS I would be happy with that
61:16 - um so um and I'm not too worried
61:21 - um so
61:24 - um models under
61:29 - consideration uh so uh
61:33 - Gemma uh transform these are not models
61:36 - I'm going to say models
61:40 - Frameworks transformers. JS
61:43 - models um
61:45 - llama via o llama and then local AI
61:51 - models these are what I'm thinking of um
61:55 - my my preference is for on device and
61:59 - fine-tuned model okay
62:03 - okay all right so now uh thank you to
62:07 - deom who is a very I think a red cap if
62:11 - not dbom should be uh a wonderful
62:14 - helpful coding train uh
62:17 - member uh who did a little bit of
62:19 - research for me uh around how to get
62:22 - started and sent me these two links your
62:26 - first extension
62:29 - now it looks like Visual Studio code in
62:32 - its
62:35 - documentation
62:36 - recommends using
62:39 - typescript but you can also use
62:41 - JavaScript so I'm really trying to
62:43 - decide this is a good poll where do I
62:45 - put this poll out can I put it here let
62:49 - see can I create I'm going to create a
62:51 - poll
62:53 - uh
62:54 - types TS or
62:59 - JS so I'm GNA start this poll so the and
63:03 - i h f you know I'm quite well known for
63:06 - not for going against whatever the poll
63:08 - is just be aware so I
63:14 - um so the reason for me to use
63:16 - typescript would be a lot of the
63:19 - documentation has in typescript and I it
63:22 - might be good for me to learn
63:24 - typescript the reason for me to use
63:27 - JavaScript
63:29 - is I might move I might be able to
63:31 - develop this more quickly because I know
63:34 - JavaScript and I don't know
63:37 - typescript also if I want people from
63:40 - the community to be able to help develop
63:43 - this project is writing it in JavaScript
63:46 - going to make that friendlier and easier
63:48 - for
63:50 - people
63:52 - uh and so far so far it looks like JS is
63:57 - uh
63:59 - winning I'm seeing use JS let's avoid
64:02 - typescript
64:04 - Madness JS is easier use
64:11 - JS so I'm starting to feel the
64:14 - JS
64:18 - as if you use JS you're actually
64:20 - supporting typescript that's
64:23 - interesting so also like is it I guess
64:26 - maybe it's is it kind of true that like
64:28 - I don't have to feel so locked in right
64:30 - now and if I just start with JavaScript
64:34 - I'll be
64:37 - fine I don't even know how to begin with
64:40 - this js+ JS
64:45 - St all right I'll let this poll go for
64:47 - another minute or
64:50 - two all right well I'm going to read
64:52 - through this
64:54 - page
64:58 - color theme file icon Tree View web view
65:01 - custom editors is custom editors what I
65:10 - want I know there was also a um hold
65:14 - on using JavaScript let's let's go
65:19 - here so this is a Hello World minimal
65:22 - sample commands register command window
65:25 - show information message npm install run
65:29 - extension
65:32 - okay so let's look at here what
65:35 - are types vs
65:38 - code
65:43 - extension
65:50 - um JS to avoid overhead typescript can
65:53 - be an improvement later okay I like this
65:57 - okay I and and JavaScript is winning the
66:00 - poll so that's kind of what I wanted to
66:04 - do anyway all right so but honestly like
66:07 - I don't even know how to get started
66:10 - uh let's
66:13 - see
66:15 - uh first extension
66:18 - okay all right so I think though I don't
66:20 - want to do this because this is
66:23 - gonna this is
66:26 - first use yman and vs code extension
66:30 - generator okay I mean I guess I could
66:34 - try
66:36 - this if you do not want to install yo yo
66:39 - man for later
66:41 - use I'm fine with installing it globally
66:43 - so let's try
66:48 - this uh
66:51 - okay all right let me do this Global oh
66:54 - so I think think I need to I'm GNA get
66:57 - rid of my package.json I got to start
66:59 - over
67:01 - Okay so let's install
67:10 - this
67:11 - [Music]
67:14 - um okay
67:17 - and okay all right so while that's
67:20 - installing I'm going to wait
67:23 - here so it looks like this is is a way
67:26 - to create the
67:31 - project and
67:36 - then I
67:38 - see okay got
67:44 - it got okay so this is how I'm going to
67:46 - run
67:51 - it
67:54 - okay
68:05 - okay installed so now let's try yo
68:13 - code oh welcome to the visual studio
68:16 - code extension generator oh I can make a
68:19 - JavaScript one yes new extension it is
68:27 - Bizarro
68:30 - Devon oh now I need a name I can rename
68:33 - it later right they call it Bizarro
68:38 - Devon P5
68:43 - conductor Bizarro Devon I'll just name
68:46 - it that for right now uh
68:49 - sure
68:51 - uh
68:53 - uh I don't have a description forehead
68:56 - uh creative coding uh let's see
69:02 - unhinged creative coding AI
69:07 - agent enable JavaScript type checking
69:10 - sure oh no I didn't know initialize a
69:13 - git repository
69:14 - yes I'm GNA use
69:17 - npm
69:20 - okay ah I see it made its own folder do
69:24 - you want to open the new folder with
69:27 - Visual Studio code
69:29 - sure okay so now I have it here and I'm
69:33 - going to just grab my brainstorming
69:36 - features
69:40 - and put them in the read
69:51 - me do I need anything
69:54 - here
70:03 - okay I can come back to
70:06 - this
70:08 - later so let me replace that
70:13 - okay okay now to run the hello world
70:16 - command from the command pallet in the
70:18 - new okay
70:20 - wait inside the editor open source
70:23 - extension. TS and press f
70:26 - five
70:35 - okay so if I press
70:42 - F5
70:43 - okay
70:45 - so run the hello world command from the
70:48 - command
70:52 - pallet that must be this
70:57 - hello world from Bizarro Devon hi
71:00 - Bizarro Devon all right that's
71:04 - awesome okay so that's
71:06 - working change the message okay run
71:10 - developer reload window okay this by the
71:13 - way is definitely one of the things that
71:15 - I'll want to have to you know a lot of
71:17 - things that I'm that when you work on
71:20 - codewise you really need more monitor
71:23 - space because clearly I'm going to be
71:25 - writing the code for the extension in
71:28 - one window and then I'm going to need to
71:31 - look at another Visual Studio code
71:33 - window on a separate monitor to see it
71:36 - running and reloading but it'll be a
71:38 - little awkward here
71:41 - um but
71:43 - um I can rename it later famous last
71:47 - words I know uh so but let's see if I
71:50 - can make a
71:51 - change uh
71:53 - congratulations hello work
71:58 - so cho
72:00 - cho so I'm going to say change that to
72:02 - cho cho from Bizarro
72:06 - Devon uh and then reload window in the
72:10 - new
72:11 - window
72:15 - huh how do I reload
72:18 - window hold on let's make a change run
72:23 - developer reload window in the new
72:25 - window ah
72:37 - okay okay and
72:42 - then Choo Cho okay and now if I
72:45 - change the
72:50 - command oh I see we got the terminal
72:52 - here oh let's install the extensions
72:54 - that wants me extension test Runner okay
72:57 - that seems
73:03 - useful uh hold on this is too much
73:05 - terminal window for
73:10 - me and let's can you see my code let's
73:14 - move this over behind me so I have a
73:17 - little more
73:19 - space and where do I create the hello
73:23 - world command
73:28 - where is the command
73:41 - name command R is the shortcut to reload
73:44 - okay but what I'm looking for is where
73:47 - is the name of the command hello
73:51 - world okay the command has been defined
73:53 - in package.json file
73:56 - okay ah so if I want the command to be
74:00 - Cho
74:03 - chw I can change this
74:07 - here and then in the code I would change
74:11 - this
74:13 - here and
74:16 - then command R reloads the
74:20 - window and there's the command Choo Cho
74:24 - from Bizarro Devon okay I'm up and
74:26 - running with an extension
74:29 - awesome um so I code comments are
74:33 - wonderful but sometimes the boilerplate
74:35 - comments are not as
74:37 - helpful
74:38 - um so I'm gonna take this
74:44 - out okay I'm Gonna Leave
74:51 - This so I understand what console log is
74:58 - a shorter message is
75:09 - fine uh the command has been defied in
75:12 - package.json
75:15 - okay I'm G to leave those comments
75:23 - here
75:25 - okay
75:27 - okay great now I prefer here's another
75:31 - sort of like setup question I prefer to
75:35 - use es6
75:36 - Imports so these days so if I were to
75:42 - add
75:47 - type
75:49 - module is that going to work or am I am
75:52 - I losing the plot here by focusing on
76:07 - this
76:20 - um
76:22 - um
76:23 - okay
76:31 - all right let's see and then this would
76:36 - be this and
76:40 - this is this silly for me to
76:53 - do
77:01 - uhoh uhoh I broke something so maybe I
77:04 - shouldn't do
77:08 - that
77:11 - ah read the comments uh hold on register
77:17 - command yeah I think maybe I can't do
77:20 - that all right let's back out of
77:22 - that was a nice idea that that's it's
77:25 - really
77:36 - unnecessary we should be fine
77:41 - now let's
77:51 - see but why is it
77:57 - how do I what did I do wrong now how do
77:59 - I get it okay well I need to know how to
78:01 - debug this so I need to figure out where
78:03 - I get the errors
78:08 - okay so let's let's hit
78:13 - refresh Choo Cho ah okay it's back and
78:16 - working again okay we're good I forgot
78:19 - to reload it thank you for everyone
78:20 - telling me I forgot to reload it okay so
78:23 - now
78:28 - here another
78:31 - command debug oh no
78:35 - look
78:37 - it's in the example here it's showing
78:40 - this
78:41 - import so I don't know why it didn't let
78:43 - me do
78:46 - that I can deal with that later okay
78:53 - debugging vs codes built-in debugging
78:56 - functionality makes it easy to debug
78:58 - extensions set a breakpoint no no I'm
79:00 - not going to use a breakpoint are you
79:02 - kidding
79:03 - me have you w have you ever watched the
79:05 - coding train you think I'm going to use
79:07 - a breakpoint no no I'm just gonna
79:08 - console log here that's how you
79:12 - debug where do I see the console log is
79:15 - it
79:17 - just I guess it's just here okay so this
79:20 - is where I this is my debug console
79:24 - which I realiz it's hard for you to see
79:26 - can move this over a little bit it's
79:27 - very tiny okay there it is okay that's
79:31 - good
79:32 - enough
79:35 - uh that's typescript okay so maybe I can
79:38 - only use the es the import whatever with
79:42 - typescript okay so now what is it that I
79:47 - want to do let's look at
79:51 - this
79:53 - command Tre what do I want to do what is
79:57 - it I want to write some code which one
80:01 - of these
80:03 - things would this be a custom
80:09 - editor custom editors allow extensions
80:11 - to create fully customizable read write
80:14 - editors that are used in place of vs
80:16 - code standard text
80:19 - editor no offering alternative visual
80:23 - renderings
80:32 - this doesn't seem
80:36 - right
80:37 - uh notebook file
80:41 - chat overview let's look at
80:50 - overview uh virtual documents virtual
80:53 - workspace no
80:55 - Source
81:01 - control vs code. window. active text
81:05 - editor is the current text
81:09 - editor you can use co-pilot okay uh so
81:15 - let's
81:16 - see let's try using
81:19 - co-pilot oh first of all what the
81:23 - heck
81:35 - okay uh fine
81:40 - good
81:49 - uh all
81:51 - right okay interesting okay
81:55 - so who needs to read the documentation
81:57 - when I've got co-pilot here so it looks
82:00 - like I can get the active window
82:04 - editor and
82:07 - um I can add code to it using this okay
82:12 - do I just do this in activate like this
82:14 - is when
82:16 - you but no this is I don't want to do it
82:19 - when I activate I want to do it when the
82:21 - command
82:23 - runs so this is when the command runs
82:26 - okay so it should go in
82:30 - here so let's do that here so let's make
82:34 - this its own function like run AI agent
82:39 - I just want to like put this in its own
82:53 - function all right so let's see if this
82:57 - works again I really need a second
83:00 - window here
83:02 - so and actually let's I should have put
83:07 - that
83:09 - um display message that
83:13 - there to create a text file
83:19 - first okay so let's just do that
83:25 - so let's just okay so if I go now this
83:28 - is really a pain is there a is there a
83:30 - key command I can use to switch between
83:33 - Windows really fast because this is a
83:36 - pain okay
83:39 - so create a text file first awesome
83:42 - that's what I want okay
83:50 - whoops let's just put this on the
83:52 - desktop right now
84:02 - okay look at that all right so it's
84:06 - adding
84:08 - something all right this
84:15 - is all right so what
84:20 - if let me just add a
84:27 - let me add a
84:29 - um p5js sketch real
84:39 - quick
84:53 - uh
85:09 - what is going on here to close all
85:14 - this no okay insert here this
85:20 - string uh I need to
85:23 - close
85:24 - this parentheses
85:27 - right what am I got wrong editor okay
85:31 - this is a
85:32 - function
85:34 - this two arguments the string here curly
85:38 - bracket curly
85:41 - bracket close
85:43 - parentheses and then ah close run AI
85:47 - agent there we go
85:50 - okay okay fine um okay so let's see
85:56 - now uh I'm eventually I'm going to need
85:59 - it to like
86:02 - create ultimately what I'm going to need
86:04 - it to do is create the index it should
86:06 - do everything but for right now what I'm
86:10 - going to do
86:12 - is
86:16 - um let's make a
86:22 - um let's make another
86:31 - folder
86:38 - oops and then
86:42 - um let's
86:44 - open
86:49 - folder let's manually
86:52 - add index
86:55 - HTML and let's just
86:59 - grab
87:04 - this and then let's manually create
87:07 - sketch.
87:12 - JS so
87:14 - now and I don't need the sound
87:18 - library or
87:22 - style.css so now what I want it to
87:27 - do
87:28 - is coming back to here oops no coming
87:31 - back to so confusing all these different
87:34 - Windows uh this is good oh so now go
87:38 - back to
87:40 - here and
87:42 - hit uh
87:45 - refresh run my
87:48 - command
87:50 - okay now how do I get it to Auto format
87:55 - I just wanted to do that now this I
87:57 - don't know if this is ultimately what
87:58 - I'm going to want it to do but let's see
88:02 - editor
88:03 - insert run auto
88:08 - format
88:10 - awesome so I'm going to execute the
88:12 - command format
88:14 - document now how can I have it create a
88:18 - preview window let's see if we can do it
88:21 - like uh run live preview
88:32 - extension
88:36 - oops um I don't have enough like space
88:44 - here open developer tools that doesn't
88:48 - seem like that's going to
88:52 - work uh so I'm looking at the chat
89:00 - here uh
89:02 - command if exposed by that extension
89:05 - okay um so let's see do I have let's
89:10 - look at
89:11 - this okay
89:14 - uh live preview start
89:23 - server
89:24 - let's try that
89:27 - okay all right we're going to try
89:40 - this didn't format it and it didn't run
89:44 - the live preview did I get an
89:46 - error okay hold
89:48 - on uh did I I I probably forgot to
89:52 - reload I think I I forgot to
89:55 - reload is there is there no Auto
90:03 - reload ah okay at least I got an error
90:05 - now okay rejected promise live preview
90:09 - start server not
90:11 - found so what is the
90:14 - command for
90:17 - that
90:22 - um
90:25 - so how do I find look can I go
90:32 - here copy command ID
90:42 - title
90:44 - no
90:51 - uh copy command ID
90:58 - ah live preview ah live preview start
91:05 - okay okay let's try
91:12 - this oh wait I have to I have to
91:21 - reload okay it's fine
91:26 - uh all
91:30 - right but why did it not hold on is this
91:34 - a one-time
91:38 - issue oh added it
91:44 - again it's not autof formatting but I'm
91:47 - not too that I I'm sure I could fix that
91:49 - bug oh okay okay so what do I have so
91:54 - far it's let's review what I have so
91:57 - far right
92:00 - now when I run the
92:03 - command
92:05 - it checks to see if there is a text file
92:08 - so things that need it needs to
92:11 - do uh to
92:14 - do uh so first uh to do receive a prompt
92:20 - to get
92:22 - started uh um to do
92:30 - um create
92:32 - index.html and sketch.
92:35 - JS run live
92:39 - server and then also set up the window
92:43 - panes
92:46 - properly so how let's see can I move
92:51 - live
92:52 - preview
92:55 - above the
93:00 - editor I cannot be
93:09 - right how do I get the preview
93:15 - window what is this
93:20 - called like basically I want to do I
93:22 - want to do I I think want it to
93:25 - appear I mean maybe the layout is not
93:27 - the most important thing right now but I
93:30 - think I want it to look like
93:33 - this because ultimately I'm
93:38 - imagining creating a like I'm gonna have
93:42 - one computer and one projector so I'm
93:46 - kind of
93:47 - imagining
93:52 - seeing
93:54 - this on half the screen and then another
93:58 - duplicate on half the other half of the
94:00 - screen I'm typing over here the agent is
94:04 - typing on the other side that's what I'm
94:07 - imagining probably figuring out the
94:09 - layout stuff right now isn't super
94:11 - important and I could do that so I'm
94:14 - trying to what would be what what is
94:16 - something that I should work on
94:22 - next um like maybe I should just try
94:27 - getting an AI model in here to generate
94:30 - the code based on a
94:33 - prompt let me look at my features ideas
94:37 - so I have this okay well I need to okay
94:40 - here's what I need to do I need to have
94:43 - it have some kind of back and
94:45 - forth
94:47 - so
94:50 - um
94:52 - and that seems so
94:54 - uh so maybe I should create some type of
94:59 - time Loop is what I should be working on
95:01 - next and I by the way I only have about
95:03 - 20 minutes left and so
95:07 - um uh actually I should probably just go
95:10 - for about 10 you know what I I'm gonna
95:12 - wrap up soon I'm gonna file some issues
95:15 - and I'm going to talk about how I might
95:18 - like people to contribute to this if
95:20 - you're
95:21 - interested so let's let's do a couple
95:25 - things one
95:28 - is let me let's see if I can I just
95:31 - haven't decided if I'm going to use
95:32 - transformers. JS so I'm I'm a little
95:34 - hesitant to just add that in there but
95:36 - let's think about
95:42 - this so I'm getting the active editor
95:50 - window ah vs code window I see
95:54 - how can I get a list of
96:22 - windows
96:25 - where do I see
96:27 - that oh here it
96:31 - is so this might be hard for you to see
96:33 - I'm G to try to zoom into it so this is
96:35 - the list of
96:38 - Windows document edit hide selection so
96:42 - somehow I'm going to have to like look
96:44 - through the documentation and figure out
96:46 - how to get the preview pane window and
96:49 - arrange them but that I'm not going to
96:51 - work on right now what I would like to
96:54 - do is figure out like should I just use
96:57 - set interval right now let's try using
96:59 - set
97:04 - interval no that's
97:12 - not I mean I guess JavaScript is kind of
97:15 - multi-threaded on its own so I don't
97:17 - have to worry about
97:19 - it oh but this could be an async
97:22 - function
97:25 - yeah so I could await certain
97:28 - things let's just try this
97:43 - uh okay
97:52 - so
97:54 - why is this an error oh okay that's fine
97:58 - um I just want to try
98:12 - this so I'm going to need to have
98:15 - there's going to be like API calls or
98:17 - whatever so I just want to see like a
98:19 - wait pause agent 2 seconds
98:30 - oh okay hold on I see hold
98:34 - on this should
98:38 - be this should have been outside of
98:48 - this just curious and
98:52 - then
99:08 - well let's see how this does so
99:10 - basically I wanted to create this is I'm
99:13 - just testing this out just going to
99:15 - write a little bit of
99:16 - code start the live
99:20 - preview then uh
99:24 - pause for 3 seconds then add the draw
99:29 - function let's see if this
99:31 - works just trying to
99:38 - understand so let turn this off delete
99:43 - this this
99:46 - here
99:48 - refresh run the
99:52 - command 1 1,00 2 1,00 3 1000 oh it added
99:59 - it whoa what just
100:02 - happened whoa who okay hold on oh
100:05 - because I used the position okay hold on
100:08 - let's fix
100:09 - that oh no do I have to make how do I
100:13 - get the current
100:22 - position
100:24 - okay can will that work did it
100:25 - hallucinate that or is that actually
100:27 - correct
100:30 - okay so back to
100:36 - this close
100:38 - this delete
100:42 - this
100:44 - refresh run my command 1 1,00 2 1,000 3
100:49 - 1,000 yes okay now
100:53 - I really wanted to add those characters
100:56 - one character at a time I know this is
100:58 - silly but this is important to me so I'm
101:01 - actually going
101:04 - to
101:07 - uh always use
101:13 - this can I will this actually
101:20 - work
101:22 - uh
101:37 - okay uh
101:52 - insert
101:56 - four like I'm going to try adding it one
101:59 - at a
102:05 - time and then
102:08 - await pause agent yeah okay so let's try
102:11 - this and this needs to be
102:13 - async so I'm just seeing now if I can
102:17 - add the code in like it's typing it okay
102:22 - and
102:23 - just out of curiosity can I put in line
102:26 - breaks I'm just curious okay let's see
102:29 - if this
102:34 - works
102:36 - um okay
102:39 - and Bruno is asking is it safe to write
102:43 - one character at a time while a auto
102:45 - reloading the sketch yeah so I'll
102:46 - definitely have to watch out for that
102:48 - the other thing is I could not I could
102:49 - just use a different local server
102:53 - that's not live preview and refresh the
102:55 - sketch automatically like and have that
102:57 - be a piece of the code but let's just
102:59 - see if this
103:00 - works so let's go here so I need to
103:05 - close
103:09 - this oh insert oh no I forgot to
103:12 - refresh I forgot to
103:18 - refresh
103:22 - refresh
103:25 - wait what just happened it didn't
103:33 - work ah okay because
103:44 - this all right hold on let's take all
103:46 - this
103:47 - out let's take this out for right
103:52 - now
103:55 - so I'm probably going to have to I'm I
103:59 - wonder if edit do I really have to call
104:02 - editor.
104:06 - edit I wonder if you can't call insert
104:09 - multiple times in here but anyway let's
104:10 - just try this one more
104:15 - time just want to understand how this
104:22 - works
104:28 - yeah rejected promise edit is only valid
104:31 - while call back runs got it so I think
104:34 - what I would need to do
104:48 - is this has to happen
104:52 - here
104:56 - ah yeah so this happens out
105:00 - here I can refactor this to like write
105:04 - this in a more thoughtful way but let me
105:07 - just see right now what would
105:10 - happen
105:16 - um okay so this I think this might work
105:21 - right because I'm going to do one
105:23 - character at a time in the loop
105:28 - here so refresh
105:33 - run
105:35 - [Applause]
105:38 - yeah awesome
105:41 - okay now I love
105:43 - that okay so uh
105:49 - now if I put
105:51 - in
105:53 - let's put in live preview
105:57 - here and let's add just for
106:02 - fun uh let's add this in
106:07 - here uh and
106:10 - also
106:16 - um
106:21 - uh
106:26 - just one okay let's do this one more
106:28 - time okay uh so now I go
106:36 - here and I refresh and I run the command
106:49 - [Applause]
106:51 - again oh fill
106:54 - zero I forgot to fill the background
106:57 - with
106:57 - white okay one more time okay this
107:03 - is now how do I get it I really wanted
107:05 - to run that auto
107:07 - format but I don't know
107:12 - why it's let's try having it run that
107:15 - here and then just just to finish this
107:20 - off this is going to be the last thing
107:23 - I'm going to do and then I'll kind of
107:25 - talk
107:32 - about okay here's my coding agent it's
107:37 - coding some hardcoded P5
107:47 - sketch yay okay but it doesn't run I
107:51 - I've done something wrong
107:53 - in terms of executing this format
107:56 - command but I can figure that out later
107:58 - okay so let me put this
108:01 - on uh GitHub
108:09 - now um let's put it in coding train
108:13 - Bizarro
108:16 - Devon it's going to be
108:18 - public uh create
108:21 - Repository
108:25 - um okay so
108:29 - now
108:35 - oh where am I
108:38 - here I don't know where I
108:41 - am oh I'm in bizar
108:49 - okay ah
108:51 - okay
108:55 - okay uh I guess I want all of this stuff
108:59 - let me look at git is there a g
109:01 - ignore let me also add DS
109:06 - store
109:08 - um
109:21 - okay oh
109:24 - uh then I
109:27 - need
109:34 - this oh
109:42 - seriously okay great
109:48 - okay okay so I am uh wrapping up the
109:53 - stream for today uh I have uh
109:57 - successfully created a proof of concept
110:00 - Bizarro Devon uh needs a title needs a
110:05 - name um and I would welcome any of you
110:10 - to contribute to this project so for
110:14 - example
110:16 - um here are some things like uh when um
110:21 - create 5js
110:24 - sketch when the
110:27 - command is first run it should create uh
110:33 - index.html and
110:37 - [Music]
110:50 - [Music]
110:51 - sketch.jpg
110:56 - Windows the
111:00 - extension
111:02 - should uh focus on sketch. JS and the
111:07 - preview Pane and put and place the
111:12 - preview pane above the sketch. JS editor
111:18 - okay um so I'm just filing some issues
111:21 - of things that I'm thinking about that
111:22 - people could contribute to
111:28 - um and uh development window is a very
111:32 - lightweight editor without any
111:33 - extensions
111:34 - installed ah okay got it um so
111:40 - uh run code
111:44 - formatter fix bug where format uh run
111:51 - format document
111:53 - after some code has been
111:57 - added um okay
112:01 - and
112:04 - uh let's
112:06 - see um okay so um all right so basically
112:12 - I'm GNA continue to work on this um I
112:16 - would my kind of thinking is to try to
112:20 - get it up and running and sort of built
112:23 - in a thoughtful scalable way without the
112:27 - AI models first so even if like as a
112:31 - starting point what I might imagine
112:33 - doing is just putting like the answer to
112:36 - what it's going to build in a local text
112:37 - file and have it basically like
112:40 - basically creating a script so I I think
112:43 - actually so this is what I think would
112:44 - make sense like create a
112:48 - script create a script and run that
112:51 - script so basically write into a Json
112:55 - file a script
112:57 - that that
113:00 - includes
113:02 - hardcoded
113:05 - narration p5js sketch fractal tree
113:11 - maybe uh this will show then once this
113:17 - runs and
113:20 - plays plays out the script will be
113:24 - replaced with an AI model
113:28 - TBD so this is kind of how I'm imagining
113:31 - building this so I might create like a
113:33 - Json file that's kind of a script that
113:35 - basically says like first say this then
113:38 - write this code then say this then write
113:40 - this code and if I can just watch that
113:43 - play out in the editor while I'm also
113:46 - coding in the editor then I'm ready to
113:48 - have the AI Model come in and replace
113:51 - the script so I think there's a a lot of
113:53 - work to be done before I even bring in
113:56 - whatever model I might choose to
113:59 - use all
114:01 - right um so I am going
114:07 - to
114:10 - uh finish up for today um thank you for
114:15 - joining this live stream I have about
114:17 - five minutes left oh here's an important
114:19 - thing for me to tell you one of the
114:21 - reasons well there's a lot of reasons
114:23 - why I need to finish at noon personally
114:27 - but um one of the reasons why I wanted
114:29 - to finish at noon is because uh I want
114:32 - to plug two other creative coding video
114:36 - makers and streamers so uh in five
114:39 - minutes I'm going to send you all to
114:41 - Raphael's twitch stream but before I
114:43 - even get there I just want to mention um
114:46 - I've been following uh let's see if I
114:48 - can go to YouTube um uh Pat Vera's
114:51 - channel so if you're looking for more
114:53 - coding tutorials and creative coding
114:56 - examples Pat um I I found on YouTube uh
114:59 - recently I am actually subscribed to Pat
115:02 - it's just not showing that because I'm
115:04 - currently not signed into to YouTube in
115:05 - case people are why are you not
115:07 - subscribed um but um if we go to Pat's
115:10 - Channel you can see that they are
115:13 - releasing a ton of videos Monday
115:16 - Wednesday Friday so if you're looking
115:17 - for somebody who was kind of like I mean
115:20 - I feel like this was me I'm not I me Pat
115:22 - is a completely different person so
115:24 - don't get this twisted or confused but
115:26 - 10 years ago when I was starting to do
115:28 - this I was kind of making three or four
115:29 - videos a week and doing it in a very
115:32 - agile way um and I think that's actually
115:35 - really a wonderful way to create um
115:39 - coding tutorials and videos and engage
115:41 - with the community and Pat is really
115:43 - doing that so if we look at Pat's recent
115:46 - videos there's just like two days ago 4
115:48 - days ago six days ago and you'll
115:49 - actually find like a lot of topics I
115:52 - have also explored so I think like I
115:54 - have a video on the mener sponge but I
115:56 - assume if you watch Pat's video on the
115:58 - mener sponge you'll get a different
115:59 - perspective Pat also released a video on
116:02 - slime molds um this is actually one that
116:05 - I uh I want to do myself so um I think
116:09 - it's sort of interesting to have
116:10 - multiple takes on these different
116:12 - algorithms so I really wanted to just
116:14 - mention Pat's Channel everyone should
116:16 - subscribe watch those videos um thank
116:19 - you Pat for bringing a whole new
116:21 - perspective and energy and way of doing
116:24 - things to this YouTube creative coding
116:26 - space
116:28 - um so uh now oh and uh Raphael is in the
116:33 - chat so that was me plugging Pat's
116:36 - channel the other uh person there's
116:40 - plenty of people you should be following
116:42 - I'm sure I'm missing people but um why
116:45 - am I blanking on oh Tim Roden Becker is
116:47 - terrific and does a lot of videos and
116:49 - courses but if I go to twitch.tv I think
116:52 - Sable Rafe Sable rafh I don't know why I
116:56 - always insist on saying Rafe even though
116:57 - I know it's Raphael I'm sorry Raphael I
117:00 - can't get it right uh Raphael streams on
117:04 - Twitch on a very regular good schedule I
117:06 - don't know what's the topic today Rafael
117:08 - you're in the chat um but if I go to
117:11 - schedule um uh we are in a creative
117:15 - coding challenge
117:17 - review um every Sunday 12:00 noon to
117:20 - 3:00 p.m. Eastern I don't have a way of
117:26 - sending you there there's no uh transfer
117:30 - Auto transfer what do they call that a
117:32 - raid but um as I wrap up now in the next
117:35 - two minutes U meso American design is
117:39 - the theme of um the challenge um
117:44 - creative coding weekly
117:46 - creative my brain is completely melted
117:49 - right now I cannot speak words anymore
117:51 - so if you're not done with your
117:54 - consumption of Internet creative coding
117:57 - streaming and you want to see somebody
117:59 - with much better audio and a
118:04 - professionalism uh that I uh lack uh you
118:08 - should definitely switch over and uh go
118:11 - to uh uh Raphael's twitch channel so
118:15 - twitch.tv Sable
118:17 - WRA all right any last questions in the
118:21 - chat

118:24 - little
118:27 - music uh I would be uh happy to answer
118:32 - any last questions if you would like to
118:34 - so if you would like to contribute to my
118:37 - Bizarro Devon creative coding AI agent
118:40 - that I just published the thing that I
118:42 - would ask that you do is that before you
118:46 - open a poll request or Implement any
118:49 - features please open an issue and
118:52 - propose something you want to work on or
118:55 - you know write a comment to one of these
118:57 - things so you can see here we already
118:59 - have this um that way I just want to
119:03 - reduce somebody working on a feature
119:05 - that's not really going to align with
119:07 - something that I'm thinking about that I
119:08 - want for this project or duplicating
119:11 - work um so but again you can also just I
119:14 - don't mean like this is the thing that
