00:01 - This is an exciting moment,
because in this video,
00:03 - I want to look at
pulling data from an API
00:06 - and answer the question,
what is an API?
00:08 - How do you sign up to use
one, and how do you get data
00:11 - from it, and how do you
visualize something or use
00:13 - that data in your own work?
00:15 - So let's just start in a weird
sort of way from scratch.
00:18 - Obviously, I've kind of planned
this somewhat in advance,
00:21 - but I'm going to open
up my web browser here,
00:26 - and I'm going to go to--
don't look at that page.
00:29 - I'm going to go to Google,
and I'm going to say,
00:31 - I'm looking for--
00:34 - looking for-- I'm looking
forward to hearing from you.
00:36 - I really am.
00:36 - By the way, this is
sort of an interesting--
00:38 - this is totally--
no, no, I'm not
00:39 - going to get into
an aside about how
00:40 - they do this predictive stuff.
00:41 - I'm looking for weather data.
00:45 - Mm, weather.com?
00:46 - No, let's see.
00:47 - I'm looking for
open weather data.
00:52 - Oh, there we go.
00:54 - So in other words,
you're most likely
00:56 - going to have to start
searching on the internet
00:58 - to find the data you
want, or your friends
01:00 - will tell you about some data.
01:01 - This bri-- and this is a
nice API to use to start.
01:05 - Weather data, I
think, is intuitive.
01:07 - It's easy to understand.
01:08 - Like, most of us are
familiar with the weather,
01:10 - and it's like sort
of small chunks,
01:12 - and you can query in different
ways-- weather for this city,
01:14 - weather for this day,
that sort of thing,
01:16 - historical weather data,
current weather data.
01:19 - So there's a lot of
parameters and ideas
01:21 - here just packaged
in this simple idea.
01:22 - At the same time,
it's a little bit
01:24 - of a cliche to say, I'm going
to make a project with weather
01:26 - data, because it's kind of
everybody's first example.
01:29 - That said, that's
what I'm going to use.
01:31 - So let's say you found this
thing called Open Weather Map,
01:35 - and I'm going to click on this,
and I'm going to see that,
01:38 - hm, clearly, there's
weather here, data here.
01:41 - There's stuff being visualized,
and what I'm looking for
01:43 - is something that says API.
01:47 - API stands for Application
Programming Interface,
01:50 - meaning I am writing a program.
01:53 - Open Weather Map is a program.
01:55 - Their programs are
running on their server.
01:57 - My program is ultimately
running on my server,
01:59 - whether that's just my
laptop or some server
02:01 - that I'm going to
upload my project to.
02:03 - And those two servers need
to talk to each other.
02:06 - I could draw a diagram with
two circles and things talking
02:08 - to each other, but
you get the idea.
02:10 - They need an interface by
which to talk to each other.
02:12 - That's what an API is.
02:13 - It's a thing for computers
to talk to each other,
02:15 - rather than the-- really, human
beings, the thing that's me
02:19 - and you-- like, we
should really spend time
02:21 - talking to each other, too.
02:22 - I think that would be--
02:23 - but hopefully, computers
talking to each other
02:24 - can help us talk to each other.
02:26 - I don't know.
02:26 - Think about that.
02:27 - Think about that as
you make projects.
02:31 - That's too much of an aside.
02:32 - OK, so look, and it's fall.
02:34 - You can see the nice
changing colors and leaves.
02:36 - It's quite lovely.
02:37 - So how do you
suddenly use this API?
02:40 - So the first thing you
want to do is click on it,
02:43 - and you could see, OK, well,
there's some information here.
02:47 - For example, what
if I want to get--
02:49 - let's say I want to get
current weather data.
02:51 - Let me slide this
over a little bit.
02:53 - I'm going to click on More,
and looking here, I could see,
02:57 - ah, there's like all this stuff.
03:01 - So here's the thing.
03:03 - Ultimately, the ease of
using a particular API
03:06 - is as good as its--
03:08 - how easy it's going to be is
how well-documented it is.
03:11 - Are there examples?
03:12 - Is there a video of somebody
telling you how to use it?
03:15 - A lot of APIs--
03:16 - I'm going to show you this
when we look at the New York
03:18 - Times or Wordnik--
03:19 - have an online tool, like a form
that you can sort of play with
03:22 - and test out the API, which
almost writes the code for you
03:25 - in a weird sort of way.
03:27 - So these are types of
things that you might use.
03:29 - But for us right now,
I'm just going to kind
03:30 - of say, like, oh, look at this.
03:32 - Examples of API calls
api.openweatherm
03:35 - ap.org/data/2.5/
weather?q=London.
03:40 - That's good enough
for me right now.
03:41 - I'm happy to work with the
weather data in London.
03:44 - So what I can do is
I can copy this URL.
03:47 - I could actually
just click on it,
03:48 - and I'm going to open
a new tab, and I'm
03:51 - going to put it in there,
and I'm going to hit Enter.
03:55 - And I'm going to be excited
about getting my weather data.
03:58 - Oh, shoot.
04:00 - So this is going
to happen to you.
04:01 - Now it used to be Open
Weather Map was actually
04:03 - one of the examples that
are used to demonstrate,
04:05 - because it actually
didn't require an API key.
04:07 - It would give you
the data anyway.
04:09 - But this is typically something
that you're going to find.
04:13 - If a company or an organization
or just some person
04:17 - is opening up their
data, they want
04:19 - you to identify yourself when
you're asking for the data.
04:22 - So you have to sign up for an
account and get a special key.
04:25 - That way, they can
track how often
04:27 - are you accessing the data,
what are you using the data for,
04:29 - and, ultimately, this
is a paid service.
04:32 - So we can use Open Weather Map
for free, but if you built--
04:36 - I don't know what
the thresholds are--
04:37 - but if you built an application
that has millions of users that
04:41 - are querying
whether data, you're
04:43 - going to have to pay a fee
to Open Weather Map to have
04:45 - all of those queries.
04:47 - So we could go to this
URL, which would give us
04:49 - more information about it.
04:50 - But ultimately, what I'm going
to do is go back to here,
04:53 - and I'm going to look
for, ah, Sign Up.
04:55 - So let's go to Sign Up,
and I'm already signed in.
04:58 - Log out.
04:58 - Log out.
04:59 - I'm going to enter
in an email, daniel--
05:03 - I was going to sign up--
05:04 - .shiffman.net, and I'm
going to make up a password.
05:07 - Should I tell you
what my password is?
05:09 - Wouldn't that be exciting?
05:10 - Porcupine.
05:12 - You can all use my--
05:14 - I don't know.
05:14 - Like, what happens
on the internet
05:16 - if I just say what
my password is?
05:17 - Technical hiccup.
05:18 - I'm now going to log into
my Open Weather Map account.
05:21 - You're going to have
to create an account.
05:22 - I already had an
account and was trying
05:24 - to create an account with
the same email address.
05:26 - So it's easier if I
just sign into mine,
05:28 - when I'm going to
hit Submit here.
05:29 - And once you create
an account, you're
05:30 - going to see that
you have an API key.
05:32 - An API key is like this
sort of secret thing
05:35 - that identifies you, that
you can use in your code
05:37 - to make the API query.
05:39 - So now I have to ask myself, if
I copy and paste this API key,
05:43 - where do I put it?
05:45 - Where do I put it?
05:46 - This is the path for
querying Open Weather Map.
05:50 - How do I get the API key to
be associated with that path?
05:53 - And this brings up a topic.
05:54 - I really do actually need
the whiteboard, which
05:56 - relates to URL query strings.
05:59 - So when you're
working with APIs,
06:01 - you typically need to not just
say, give me all your weather.
06:05 - You need to say things like,
give me all your weather
06:07 - in this city on this day.
06:11 - Give me the high temperature.
06:12 - Give me the low temperature.
06:14 - And then you also need to
say, with this API key.
06:16 - How do you do that?
06:18 - So if you have some URL
like openweathermap.org,
06:25 - a query string is a thing that
comes at the end of the URL.
06:29 - Now there's different ways
of formatting query strings,
06:32 - but the most common or one
of the more common ones that
06:35 - at least you're going to
see with Open Weather Map--
06:37 - we'll see some other
scenarios of this--
06:38 - is starting with
a question mark.
06:42 - So the question
mark indicates, now
06:44 - I'm going to give this
URL some parameters.
06:46 - Some parameters might be
things like city=London.
06:52 - So these are now, as almost
everything is in programming,
06:56 - name value pairs.
06:58 - City=London.
06:59 - So this is saying, give me Open
Weather Map at city=London.
07:03 - You can see that's
actually already in there.
07:05 - Now it's not City.
07:06 - It's q=London, because that's
what Open Weather map expects.
07:11 - Q-- that's kind
of like for query.
07:13 - Now we need to
have a second one.
07:16 - In addition to the city, I
need to give it the API key.
07:19 - So multiple queries are strung
together with an ampersand,
07:25 - so you can say, something equals
something, ampersand something
07:29 - else equals something,
ampersand something
07:31 - else equals something.
07:32 - There's a few
little gotchas here,
07:34 - like you can't use spaces
and certain characters that
07:36 - aren't valid in the URL.
07:37 - There's ways around that through
URL encoding and decoding.
07:40 - And hopefully, I'll mention
that or get into more specifics
07:43 - about that later.
07:44 - But this is essentially what
we need to practice forming.
07:47 - And A, just forming it now
to see that the API works,
07:50 - but then, ultimately, putting
these kinds of query strings
07:53 - together dynamically in our
code, because what if the user
07:57 - types in the city?
07:58 - And then you get
that from the user,
08:00 - and then you've got to insert
what the user put into your API
08:03 - query.
08:04 - So over here, I can
now add something.
08:07 - I can say-- and I happen
to know this in advance--
08:10 - APPID=, and a paste.
08:15 - And you can see now, I have
added into the query string,
08:18 - q=London, and APPID
equals my special API key.
08:22 - And I hit Enter,
and look at that.
08:24 - I now have JSON data.
08:26 - Look, it worked.
08:28 - So this is data I can
now load into my sketch
08:31 - and visualize based on this API.
08:35 - I can draw something based on
the current weather in London,
08:37 - and I'll do that in a moment.
08:39 - But first, I want to
mention something.
08:41 - This is kind of-- now
we're getting this thing,
08:43 - like this is JSON data,
and the computer's
08:45 - going to have no
problem reading it.
08:47 - But to me, this is
actually quite hard
08:49 - to dig through looking at it.
08:50 - And I would really
prefer if I had it nicely
08:53 - formatted with some
spaces and some line
08:55 - breaks and some colors.
08:57 - And so one thing
I recommend doing
08:58 - if you're going
to work with data
09:00 - and APIs is installing
a Chrome extension that
09:03 - will automatically format the
JSON data for you, as you're
09:06 - like--
09:07 - notice, I haven't even
written any code yet.
09:09 - I'm like 10 minutes
into this video.
09:11 - Just as I'm starting to
figure out how the API works,
09:14 - I'm just working in the browser.
09:16 - So there is a Chrome extension.
09:18 - I'm going to just Google,
Chrome extension JSON formatter.
09:22 - There's lots of them.
09:23 - This is one that I
particularly like.
09:24 - It's the first one that came up.
09:26 - I'm going to say, Add
to Chrome, and I'm
09:28 - going to say, Add Extension.
09:30 - That's been added, and
I'm going to close that.
09:32 - And I'll get you
the link to that,
09:34 - but now I'm going to hit
Refresh, and you can see now,
09:37 - this has actually
been formatted.
09:38 - And you can see these
buttons raw and parsed.
09:40 - So I can see this
is the raw data,
09:42 - and this is it parsed
to look nicely.
09:44 - And what's really
nice about this is I
09:46 - can sort of fold this up.
09:48 - So for example, I can see
that what's actually here--
09:53 - this is the sort of root object
that has these things in it.
09:56 - It's an object that has a
coordinate, a weather, a base,
09:59 - a main, a wind, a clouds.
10:01 - I don't-- I have to read through
the documentation to see what
10:03 - all these things are.
10:04 - But, for example,
let's look under Main.
10:08 - So by the way,
these are values--
10:10 - I think they're in Kelvin.
10:12 - So one thing I didn't specify
is the unit of measurement.
10:16 - Maybe I want to get these
in Celsius or in Fahrenheit.
10:19 - So let's actually take a minute.
10:21 - That's another thing that I need
to add to this query string.
10:24 - I probably need to say
something like, q=London,
10:27 - and APPID equals
my query string,
10:30 - and units equals imperial or
metric or something like that.
10:35 - So if I go back to the--
10:37 - whoops-- if I go
back to the API--
10:41 - come back.
10:41 - Come back.
10:43 - And we look through
the documentation.
10:45 - I probably-- whoops.
10:46 - We can see here, I could kind
of like poke through this,
10:51 - and it's probably going to
give me some information
10:53 - like, it's by zip code.
10:56 - I'm looking.
10:59 - Pause this video.
11:01 - OK, actually, let's just
be better about this.
11:04 - Parameters, min, max, format--
11:07 - look at this.
11:07 - Format-- Units Format.
11:09 - Let's click on this.
11:11 - Units equal-- there we go.
11:12 - So I can see here, here
are some exam-- like,
11:15 - you know, this is really--
this is your life.
11:17 - Welcome to your life now if
you want to do this stuff.
11:18 - You got to look through this
stuff and figure it out,
11:21 - and I found that
units equals metric.
11:22 - I assume that's going to give
me the information in Celsius.
11:25 - Let's be metric today.
11:27 - I feel like being metric.
11:29 - So I can add to
this particular URL.
11:32 - I can say &units=metric.
11:39 - And I'm going to
refresh the page,
11:41 - and you can see now I've got the
temperature is 13.57 Celsius.
11:45 - So this is get doing-- this
is working better for us.
11:49 - So now I'm just back
in that scenario.
11:52 - Like, let's say I want to draw
something onto the screen based
11:56 - on the current temperature.
11:57 - So all I need to do now--
11:59 - now that I've worked this out
in the browser, I have grabbed--
12:04 - I have this particular URL.
12:05 - I can go into my code.
12:07 - I'm going to open up my P5
sketch now, and I can say,
12:11 - load JSON, that
long URL, got data,
12:20 - and now I'm going to
do that thing where
12:21 - I write the function
got data, give it--
12:26 - and then just say,
print line data,
12:28 - just to see that it
works, or to discover
12:31 - that maybe what I need is
JSONP Let's see if it works.
12:34 - It worked.
12:35 - So this is a case where
I don't need JSONP.
12:37 - If I didn't see anything down
there, I'd probably add JSONP.
12:41 - And now I might say something
like, var weather, and say,
12:47 - like, when I get the
data, weather=data.
12:52 - And then here, I
might say, if weather.
12:55 - Now I can draw some stuff
based on that weather.
12:58 - So let's pick something
that I want to do.
13:00 - Let's say I want to
draw one circle based
13:02 - on the temperature and one
circle based on the humidity.
13:05 - It's my object.main.temp
or my object.main.humidity.
13:12 - So I could say,
ellipse at 50, 100,
13:19 - and then weather.main.temp
as the piece
13:25 - of data that's
going to be the size
13:27 - of this particular ellipse.
13:29 - And then I'll draw another one.
13:30 - That is just humidity,
weather.main.humidity.
13:35 - And we can see how that--
13:37 - oops.
13:38 - And let me--
13:38 - I kind of over-- let
me put that-- let
13:40 - me make that canvas a little
bit bigger and put this at 100.
13:44 - We're going to put this at
300, and we can run this again.
13:47 - And we can see, look at this.
13:49 - This particular circle is being
drawn with the temperature,
13:53 - and that second circle is
being drawn with the humidity.
13:56 - So again, I've done a
completely trivial result.
13:59 - It's not particularly
interesting.
14:00 - I'm only getting this
exact piece of data
14:03 - from the weather
in London, so I'm
14:04 - going to stop this video now,
because in the next video,
14:07 - I want to look at how I might
form a query string, how
14:09 - I might allow the user
to type in a city,
14:12 - and then show the weather
back for that city,
14:14 - or click on a link or
something like that.
14:16 - That's what I'll do
in the next video.
14:17 - But for you, for your
exercise is sign up
14:20 - for Open Weather
Map or another API.
14:22 - Try to load that data.
14:23 - Try to see if you
need an API key.
14:25 - Try to draw something
based on that data.
14:27 - And if you can make it a bit
more flexible, like you could--
14:31 - maybe the API call
happens multiple times
14:33 - for different cities.
14:34 - Try-- eh, that's a little-- that
might be a little bit tricky,
14:37 - but see what else you can
sort of imagine and do
14:39 - with this basic idea.
14:40 - And hopefully, this
was helpful to you
14:42 - with the sort of very
basics of beginning steps
14:44 - of starting to work with APIs.
14:46 - So thanks for watching, and
I've got a lot more data
14:51 - and video data and API videos
that I intend to make with--
14:57 - I've made a bunch today
that you're seeing now.
14:59 - And if you're watching
this in the future,
15:01 - you'll see the next one.
15:02 - But you're actually
watching this right now.
15:04 - The next ones will
be coming soon,
15:05 - probably next week
OK, thanks very much.
15:07 - And I'm going to hit
Stop on record goodbye.
