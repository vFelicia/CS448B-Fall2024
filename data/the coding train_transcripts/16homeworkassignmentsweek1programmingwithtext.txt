00:00 - Hello, in this video, if you're choosing to kind of follow this Programming from A to Z playlist
00:06 - as a course that you're doing over some period of time
00:07 - I'm going to talk you through homework assignment or exercise
00:12 - that I think would be useful to do before you move on to the next set of videos
00:15 - And if you're interested in participating in a slack channel
00:18 - where you could share and discuss these assignments
00:20 - please check this video's description for a link
00:22 - to the patreon crowdfunding system
00:25 - that I'm using for that particular slack channel
00:28 - But of course you could just do it and share it with me
00:29 - on twitter or youtube comments
00:31 - I'd love to see the things you guys are making
00:32 - So, here's what I think you should do
00:35 - Number one is - I think -
00:36 - ok, in the previous coding challenge
00:39 - where I implemented Jackson Mac Low and the Diastic Technique
00:43 - one of the things you could try for this homework assgnment
00:46 - is invent your own constrained writing techniques
00:49 - so, constrained writing
00:51 - is a sort of form of writing base on
00:54 - an algorithm or some set of constraints
00:57 - There's a French collective of writers known as Oulipo
01:01 - who pioneered a bunch of different techniques
01:03 - one of them is known as the "N+7" technique
01:06 - this is a nice website which I'll also include
01:09 - which implements this particular technique
01:12 - in French, it's actually referred to as S+7.
01:14 - And the way that this works
01:16 - the N+7
01:18 - you look at a body of text
01:20 - you look for every single noun in that text
01:22 - you find the noun for every body of text
01:26 - you look up the noun in the dictionary,
01:28 - find the 7th noun after that one
01:31 - and replace it back into the text
01:33 - and now you have a new text
01:35 - sort of with randomly generated new nouns based on
01:37 - the order of appearance in the dictionary
01:40 - So, you might try- one thing you might do
01:41 - is implement one of these algorithms;
01:43 - like make your own N+7 webpage
01:46 - You can see this webpage works very similarly
01:49 - to a lot of the examples that I've demonstrated for you
01:52 - another kind of
01:53 - famous example is, this is one of my
01:55 - examples you can find
01:58 - in the Github repository; this is
02:00 - using William Burrough's Cut Up method
02:01 - which is actually a physical method of cutting up text and folding text and mashing it up
02:05 - you can see that I have a slider which determines
02:07 - how much of the original text to keep
02:10 - you can drag a file in; use a text sample
02:12 - So one thing I'll mention is this
02:14 - frame of reference is a good reference for you to use
02:16 - where it's kind of giving the user
02:17 - a lot options; enter some text, drag a file in, use a preloaded text sample
02:22 - An Erasure machine; Erasure poetry
02:25 - not to be confused with the band Erasure music now
02:27 - it's a technique - I'm going to load a text sample right now
02:32 - which is a spam email that I received at one point
02:35 - and you can see I'm using dom manipulation to click on all these words
02:38 - and actually erase them
02:40 - but I could come up with another system - like erase every 7th word or erase every verb
02:44 - or erase every word that starts with E
02:48 - So, you know, I can also, btw
02:50 - based on how I'm doing this, keep the spacing, remove the spacing
02:54 - and what types of generative poetry could you create out of the Erasure algorithm
02:59 - So, even though I'm showing these digital versions of it,
03:03 - you might want to wait until next time, after you've watched the regular expression videos
03:07 - to actually implement your interactive web based
03:10 - version of it
03:12 - as a constraint on yourself, invent your own algorithm
03:15 - to do by hand
03:16 - Get a newspaper, get a magazine, get a book, invent your algorithm,
03:19 - write the instructions for the algorithm and
03:22 - execute those instructions and get your new text
03:24 - and then present those instructions
03:27 - and present those results on a webpage
03:29 - so think about -one of the things I'm asking people to think about is -
03:32 - how to have a self-documented webpage
03:34 - so instead of just presenting the result
03:36 - and then having a blogpost that explains it
03:39 - could you have a webpage that has the instructions
03:41 - has the results - kind of documents itself
03:43 - and - some of you might consider using Github to host it
03:46 - So get yourself set up
03:48 - Figure out Github pages
03:50 - Get yourself an account
03:52 - Reviewation of  CSS  for yourself
03:55 - Think about creative constraint writing techniques
03:58 - and generate the content and release it online
04:04 - So, give that a try, and share it with me
04:07 - however it is that you may find it useful to share and
04:10 - and I encourage you to, if you want to ask questions or discuss your work
04:13 - with me or a group of peers
04:14 - consider joining the patreon slack channel as well
04:18 - if you are watching so far
04:19 - and I'll be back in the next set of videos
04:22 - they might be there by now if you're
04:24 - watching this much later than I've recorded it
04:26 - but otherwise I'll be back by about a week from now
04:29 - Enjoy, and I'll see you - some time - soon! 
*raises arms in excitement*
04:33 - *continues dancing*
04:35 - thanks for watching!
*still dancing*
