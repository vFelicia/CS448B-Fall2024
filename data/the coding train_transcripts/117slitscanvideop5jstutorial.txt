00:00 - hello and welcome in this video I'm
00:02 - going to do a tutorial about how to
00:04 - create a slitscan effect in javascript
00:07 - in the browser using the p5.js framework
00:09 - so first what is a slitscan
00:11 - so slitscan is a particular kind of
00:14 - effect that plays with the idea of time
00:16 - in video in an interesting way it's been
00:18 - used throughout history and photography
00:20 - film art visual art computational design
00:23 - so it's a bit of a trope so to speak a
00:25 - cliche maybe even and if you're
00:27 - interested in that I would point you
00:28 - towards this online catalog by Golan
00:30 - Levin about slit scanning throughout
00:33 - history I'm gonna set that aside and
00:35 - really just focus on the technique
00:36 - itself and how to program it here in
00:39 - this video you can see it running right
00:41 - now the effect so let's talk about what
00:43 - it's doing so there is an image in the
00:46 - front coming from the camera you can't
00:47 - see the camera but there's a camera here
00:48 - pointing at me and what Flitz scanning
00:52 - does is it takes one column of pixels
00:54 - and copies them over and over again into
00:58 - this image next to each other so you see
01:00 - this strange sort of thing you know what
01:02 - I think might help a diagram let's come
01:05 - over here to the whiteboard so the slit
01:06 - scanning effect takes a video source and
01:11 - this could be from a live camera it
01:14 - could be from a recorded movie file any
01:17 - number of ways an animation something
01:19 - that happens over time frame by frame it
01:22 - requires some sort of canvas right a
01:25 - place where that slitscan
01:26 - effect is going to be rendered and what
01:29 - happens is the slit scanning algorithm
01:32 - goes like this take a single column of
01:34 - pixels so one column of pixels you could
01:39 - do it from anywhere the left side the
01:40 - right side over here over here but let's
01:42 - say from the center take that single
01:44 - column of pixels and copy it to the
01:46 - canvas the next moment of time there's a
01:49 - new frame of video take that same column
01:52 - of pixels and copy it next to that one
01:54 - do it again take that same column of
01:57 - pixels and copy it next to that one over
01:59 - and over and over again so moments in
02:01 - time slices of video are put next to
02:04 - each other in sequence on the canvas
02:06 - let's go back and look at this one more
02:07 - time and you can see how that's
02:09 - happening let's say I stand here
02:11 - and I stand very very very very very
02:13 - still you could see the same column of
02:16 - pixels with some slight variation around
02:17 - where my lips are happening over and
02:20 - over again now if I move to the side at
02:23 - about the speed of the camera you can
02:27 - see a speed of the slit scan so to speak
02:29 - you can see my image starting to resolve
02:31 - if I do strange like breakdancing in
02:35 - front of it you can see alien weird
02:37 - forms happening okay
02:39 - so I'll let you play this on your own
02:41 - after you've programmed it let's
02:43 - actually program and make it happen now
02:44 - so this is actually a version of the
02:47 - slip scanning this is actually a version
02:48 - of scanning algorithm running in
02:50 - processing and I have a video that does
02:52 - exactly this in processing but I'm gonna
02:54 - move to the browser and show you how to
02:55 - actually make this on your hopping on
02:57 - your website novel idea so I'm gonna
03:00 - close this and I'm gonna go to an
03:02 - example that I have already running in
03:04 - the browser this example is doing
03:05 - nothing yet it's just oh the only thing
03:07 - it's doing so far is getting the image
03:08 - from the camera and has an empty canvas
03:10 - with nothing on it so let's go look at
03:12 - the code for that so I'm gonna go over
03:14 - here we could see it oops I'm in the
03:15 - index file by action so here's the code
03:17 - all I'm doing is I'm making a canvas
03:19 - it's extra wide I could make that as
03:22 - wide or as less wide as I want by the
03:23 - way I could just lips can vertically
03:25 - might be something you think about as an
03:26 - exercise after this video I need to
03:28 - create the capture which is creating
03:30 - this live stream connecting to the
03:32 - camera you could also load a recorded
03:34 - video and see what happens with that and
03:36 - I want to shrink it down just for
03:37 - demonstration purposes but you know you
03:39 - can make it as high resolution as you
03:41 - want depending on how you know faster
03:42 - computer and browser isn't that sort of
03:44 - thing so you know ordinarily I might
03:46 - just do something like this I might just
03:48 - draw the video itself in the canvas and
03:50 - you can see if I run that I get the
03:52 - video and I'm drawing the canvas but I
03:54 - don't want to draw it in the canvas what
03:56 - I want is just a single column of pixels
03:58 - so how do I get a single column of
04:00 - pixels AHA there is a function in the
04:03 - p5.js library called copy I'm gonna
04:06 - Google copy and p5.js and we can see
04:09 - this function here you can see some
04:11 - examples of what it's doing and look at
04:12 - this you can see this is like an example
04:14 - of use it's like copy image and then
04:17 - like eight different numbers so this
04:19 - seems like an overly complex weird thing
04:21 - but
04:21 - copy function is actually quite simple
04:23 - and perfect for exactly what we need to
04:25 - do so I'm gonna come over here and let's
04:27 - talk about that copy function right copy
04:29 - and then there were nine arguments one
04:31 - two three four five six seven eight nine
04:34 - I don't know if I got nine but close
04:36 - enough so the first argument is the
04:38 - thing you want to copy from right over
04:40 - here you can see I want to copy from an
04:42 - image for us I want to copy from this
04:45 - video so that's gonna be the first
04:47 - argument the video then even though
04:50 - they're all these numbers there it's
04:51 - actually quite simple the next four
04:53 - numbers are the rectangle that you want
04:55 - to copy from and the next four numbers
04:58 - represent the rectangle that you want to
05:00 - copy to meaning I could potentially from
05:03 - this video say I want to copy this set
05:06 - of pixels some partial set of pixels and
05:09 - I want to copy them to the canvas and I
05:11 - want to stretch them out or make them
05:13 - bigger so you can do all sorts of
05:15 - interesting things with the copy
05:16 - function but we're gonna do something
05:17 - quite simple which is I want this
05:19 - rectangle right a rectangle that starts
05:21 - from the center the top-left corner of
05:24 - that rectangle being the top center of
05:25 - this source image and I want that
05:27 - rectangle to be one pixel wide and as
05:30 - high as the canvas itself so let's go
05:33 - look at that and I'm gonna come back
05:36 - here into where into my code and I'm
05:40 - going to say and I'm gonna comment out
05:42 - drawing the video image and I'm gonna
05:45 - say copy want to copy the video from
05:49 - where the center of the video which is
05:52 - video dot width divided by 2 now I'm
05:55 - going to put that in a separate variable
05:56 - just to make things a little bit more
05:58 - legible to read so I'm gonna say the
06:01 - center of the video and the top and then
06:05 - I want how wide I want one column of
06:08 - pixels so with a width of one and I want
06:10 - it to be video dot height which I will
06:12 - also put in a separate variable so
06:17 - that's what I want to copy now where do
06:20 - I want to copy it to well anywhere I
06:22 - mean there's all sorts of things I could
06:23 - do now I could copy to a random place I
06:25 - could make it I could stretch it out
06:27 - across the entire canvas but really what
06:29 - I want to do is just copy it now to the
06:31 - left of it that that left column of the
06:34 - canvas there
06:34 - edge of the canvas so where is that the
06:37 - destination rectangle is just zero zero
06:40 - it's also a width of one and the same
06:42 - exact height so if I run this now whoops
06:46 - come over here
06:48 - we're see I have an error uncaught type
06:51 - error cannot read property width of
06:53 - undefined Oh a what am I gonna do this
06:55 - horrible red error I have no idea act so
06:57 - actually I have this error earlier today
06:59 - I spent like 20 minutes trying to figure
07:01 - out what it was actually it's coming
07:02 - quite simple and I forgot one thing that
07:04 - I that I'm doing here which is a little
07:06 - bit different of how the code works in
07:07 - processing is when I'm using the copy
07:09 - function I'm accessing the pixels of
07:12 - that video image and the pixels are not
07:14 - available to me by default I've got to
07:16 - explicitly tell p5 that I want those
07:18 - pixels so one thing that I need to add
07:20 - to this particular example is just say
07:22 - video download pixels and that should
07:24 - resolve this issue as long as I have
07:26 - video download pixels there in draw so
07:29 - we can we can zoom on in here and you
07:31 - can see there's that single column of
07:33 - pixels can you see it
07:35 - sort of hard to see it's just one column
07:37 - but as I move you see the colors are
07:39 - changing so I kind of have that slitscan
07:41 - effect right I'm taking the center
07:43 - column of pixels I'm copying it to the
07:45 - top left over here but now do I need to
07:47 - do I need to copy here then here then
07:49 - here then here then here move it across
07:51 - the canvas itself so this is actually a
07:54 - really simple thing to do
07:55 - all I need is to add one additional
07:57 - variable to this program then I need to
08:00 - say instead of always copying it to the
08:02 - top left that's zero x-value just copy
08:05 - it to X that's this particular I'm sorry
08:08 - that's this particular value in the copy
08:10 - function I want to change that to X and
08:13 - then I want to just say hey next frame
08:15 - move X up by one so now always copy the
08:19 - same center column of pixels but move
08:22 - the spot where you're copying it to and
08:24 - now I'm gonna run it again and you can
08:25 - see there it is oh look there is there
08:29 - the picture SATCOM it's moving across
08:30 - now enough I'm not seeing that smearing
08:32 - effect the reason I'm not seeing it is
08:34 - because I'm clearing the background
08:35 - every time so this is a really easy
08:37 - thing to fix I just need to move
08:38 - background back into setup for this
08:41 - particular example I can hit refresh and
08:43 - all of a sudden boom there's the foot
08:45 - scanning happening right now and there
08:47 - it is as I move around
08:48 - to do my breakdancing thing so you
08:51 - there's there's some things that you
08:52 - might ask now number one is why don't
08:54 - you slip scan start over here
08:56 - it should started at zero well the draw
08:58 - loop started before the camera kind of
09:01 - had initialized so we could use a call
09:03 - back and make sure we wait to the first
09:05 - image comments but that's something you
09:06 - can worry about if you have a question
09:08 - about how to do that ask in the comments
09:10 - I'm glad to fix the example to do that
09:11 - that's sort of a minor detail another
09:13 - thing you notice is it's completely
09:14 - stopped because that X value just went
09:17 - off the side of the screen and kept
09:18 - going so I think it would be useful to
09:21 - add something to this program like you
09:25 - know if X is greater than with set X
09:29 - back equal to zero and we'll see now as
09:31 - X gets to the other side of the canvas
09:33 - it will come back so while we're waiting
09:35 - for that to happen I'll mention a few
09:37 - things you might be interested to try a
09:39 - vertical slit scan what does that do
09:42 - another idea this is my other processing
09:44 - video is a radial slit scan what if you
09:46 - thought of like the hands on a clock
09:48 - kind of twisting pixels around a
09:51 - circular path what if you had someone
09:53 - had made the comment what if you had two
09:54 - columns of pixels coming towards each
09:56 - other what if you like move them along a
09:58 - sine wave or you know alternated or put
10:01 - them in random locations there's so many
10:02 - possibilities what if your what if your
10:04 - columns weren't one pixel wide but three
10:05 - pixels wide yeah horizontal and vertical
10:08 - maybe try to create your own variation
10:10 - on this idea share what you made put a
10:12 - link in the comments I would love to
10:14 - take a look at it another thing I would
10:15 - like to show you which I think I'll do
10:17 - in a separate video is how to actually
10:19 - store all of these columns a history of
10:22 - them so that you can kind of like cycle
10:23 - them around get more of a time-shifted
10:25 - feel to it this something more similar
10:28 - to I'll show you something I did in this
10:34 - particular so this is a very similar
10:35 - idea in that there's a kind of history
10:38 - of of images but instead of but I have
10:41 - the full image next to each other what
10:43 - if I put these columns next to each
10:44 - other and have them kind of ripple in a
10:46 - different way so I think maybe I'll try
10:47 - to add that in as I like addendum video
10:49 - so leave me your questions leave me your
10:52 - comments and subscribe and I'll make
10:55 - more videos that's just what's happening
10:58 - okay bye talk to you later
