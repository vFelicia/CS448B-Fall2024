00:01 - Hello!
00:01 - This is not actually
a tutorial video.
00:03 - You could just skip
to the next one
00:04 - if you want the actual
tutorial content.
00:06 - But if you happen to be
watching this as a playlist,
00:08 - because you're learning
to program in JavaScript
00:10 - with p5.js for the
first time, I just
00:12 - want to give you
a little warning.
00:14 - All the videos you've been
watching, before this video,
00:16 - were made as of right this
moment a couple of years ago.
00:22 - I am now programming in
JavaScript with a slightly
00:24 - different style.
00:24 - It's a bit more modern style.
00:26 - It's part of ES6.
00:28 - What's ES6?
00:28 - You could go watch
a different video
00:30 - where I talk about
that that I'll link to
00:31 - in this video description.
00:33 - But where I use something
called classes to make objects.
00:37 - So the videos that
are coming next,
00:40 - the older ones are deprecated.
00:41 - They'll be off in
some other playlist
00:43 - somewhere that you
could go and find.
00:45 - But the videos that
are coming next,
00:46 - I will look like I do now
just like with more gray hair.
00:49 - I have a scar on my elbow
that I didn't have before.
00:55 - But those videos will not
assume any prior knowledge.
00:59 - They will assume that you
are arriving here just
01:02 - at the moment where
you are about--
01:04 - you just learned about
the basics of functions
01:06 - and you were about to learn
object-oriented programming.
01:09 - Also, I should mention
that in these videos,
01:11 - I'm using a slightly
different editor.
01:12 - At this point, I'm kind of
hoping that maybe you already
01:15 - have an editor, maybe I had
a different tutorial that
01:18 - showed you an editor to use.
01:20 - This is the Atom
editor, you can use it.
01:23 - But I'm going to focus on the
code in these videos and not
01:26 - the editor.
01:26 - But if you wondering
why it changed,
01:28 - that's why, I'm using something
different in these videos.
01:31 - So if that is what you would
like to do, please stay with me
01:35 - and just watch as this video--
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
01:38 - doo, doo, doo, doo
transitions to the next one,
01:40 - probably with an ad on it,
sorry about that, sorry.
01:42 - OK, see you in the
next video, maybe.
