00:00 - Hello welcome to a p5.js video
tutorial about how to use Code Pen with
00:05 - p5.js. Now codepen is a web browser based
code editor and it allows you to type some
00:11 - HTML stuff in this a box here
00:14 - it allows you to type some CSS stuff in
this box over there, and then in that box
00:18 - on the end, that I can't reach 'cause
00:19 - my arms will get cut off,
 you could typesome javascript stuff
00:23 - so there's a lot to CodePen am sure
there's a lot of features I'm actually
00:26 - you might be watching this is an
archived video but i'm actually doing
00:28 - this as a live stream and I'm using
something called CodePen professor mode
00:32 - and there are 27 people watching me live
code this right now at this very moment
00:36 - but what I want to do is just make a
quick
00:39 - p5.js sketch and see how it works with
CodePen and some of the features of
00:42 - CodePen that I might discover along the
way because I actually haven't really
00:46 - used CodePen before. This is my...  I'm
discovering this as I make this tutorial
00:50 - ok so first thing we want to do is
let's look under settings here and I want to
00:54 - go under javascript
00:56 - so one thing that I want to do is I want
to make available the p5.js javascript
01:00 - libraries now I could add references
to those in the HTML file but
01:05 - since CodePen has this feature I can
actually just add a URL to my javascript
01:09 - library right here and now
01:11 - how do i find the p5.js javascript
library?
01:14 - It just so happens that if I google CDN,
CDN by the way stands for
01:18 - Content Delivery Network because it's
going to deliver, it's a network that
01:22 - will deliver our content, the content in
this case being the p5.js library
01:25 - and I'm gonna do this CDN p5.js and
we're going to come to this URL which is
01:31 - cdnjs.com/libraries/p5.js/ 
and now I'm going to see
01:36 - a whole bunch of urls. Now
01:39 - one that I want right here for the main
p5.js library is this one so i'm going
01:43 - to grab that, I'm going to copy it and
I'm going to go back to CodePen oops..
01:48 - CodePen and am gonna place it in here and
then I'm going to add another.. amm while
01:53 - I'm here I might as well add, let's add
the DOM library as well so I'm going to
01:56 - get the DOM library and am gonna
01:59 - put that in here and then hopefully I'm
gonna save and close and now if i go
02:05 - back to settings we should see that
these files are referenced and
02:09 - incidentally popular JavaScript
libraries that you might use are
02:13 - available directly right here so if I
wanted to use jQuery for whatever reason
02:16 - I could just kind of go into 
this menu here
02:18 - ok yay ohh oww I have a giant pimple on my
nose and I just whacked it, it hurts. I don't know
02:25 - if you zoom in to the pixels this is
going to be permanently in this video
02:27 - forever now but you can zoom in and try
to find it. It's very umm...
02:31 - it's quite noticeable ok so here I'll close..
maybe I will edit that out, I wont edit that out
02:36 - it's too it's too it's just there. Ok so
now I'll.. let's just see, so one thing I'm gonna
02:40 - do is I don't really care about CSS or
HTML right now, I mean I care about them
02:45 - CSS and HTML I care about you but right
now they're not the primary focus I just
02:49 - want to see if things are working. I'm gonna add
function setup() am gonna say createCanvas
02:54 - (200,200).
02:55 - I'm gonna say background 0 and I'm gonna
hit save and look at that, there. P5.js
03:01 - sketch running in CodePen.
I don't know
03:03 - what else should we do in this tutorial?
I didn't come up with something to make
03:06 - let's just make sure things animate. I'm
gonna add function draw() and I'm going to
03:12 - say ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 16, 16)
03:17 - and am gonna hit save. I hit
Command + S by the way to save and you
03:21 - can see now there is my sketch running
03:24 - I could also add something like createP()
which is part of p5 DOM and I could say
03:29 - "This is a sketch.. this is a painting
sketch" and hit Command + S again and you
03:36 - can see now there I have a paragraph
element there. We could add something
03:40 - like let's see a print line test
03:43 - actually let's let's.. let's add
the mousePressed() function
03:48 - [laughs]
03:49 - somebody in the chat is mentioning that
'createP' sounds like something else
03:54 - I guess that's true. Umm println(mouseX)
so I want to look at the console. There's
04:01 - a console here and I can click and every
time I click you'll see my.. oh this is
04:06 - very hard for you to see
04:07 - so let's zoom in on this, you can see that I
also have access to a console right here
04:11 - in CodePen, this is lovely to use. I lov..
CodePen am enjoying it quite well.
04:15 - Look there's a chat here
04:17 - look people are talking in the chat
because they're watching this live and I
04:22 - am also going to say change view and I
can now do.. Oh look at this
04:28 - so you can see one of the nice things is
there are different views here
04:33 - so if I want to go to presentation or
full page I can actually.. I could click on
04:37 - that or I could also just go up to the
URL and type full here and now you can
04:42 - see there's my sketch.
04:43 - So this is actually how you make a p5
sketch in CodePen. It was really quite easy
04:48 - and I wish I had prepared to do some
other stuff in this video I'm going to
04:54 - just pause and maybe this video will
continue in a second where I do some
04:57 - more stuff
04:58 - I'm back and I've decided that it's okay to
have a very short just like five minute
05:02 - video that showed you very quickly how
to use p5.js in CodePen
05:06 - so if, I'm gonna do this in future videos
if, you have questions about it or
05:09 - features you want me to explore please
let me know in the comments or at the
05:14 - Rainbow Topics GitHub repository that
is also linked to in the description of
05:17 - this video. Thanks for watching.
