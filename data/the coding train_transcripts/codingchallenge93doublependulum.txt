00:01 - hello and welcome to a coding challenge
00:03 - today I'm going to attempt to make a
00:05 - double pendulum simulation now I
00:09 - actually don't have a coding challenge
00:12 - that's a single pendulum so I should
00:13 - double back double back and make the
00:16 - single pendulum challenge I do have some
00:17 - videos about pendulum simulations in my
00:20 - nature of code playlist which I will
00:22 - refer you to but I really always want to
00:26 - make the double pendulum because it's
00:27 - like this crazy
00:28 - it's creates a double pendulum which if
00:30 - you figured out already is the having
00:33 - tube a pendulum attached to another
00:36 - pendulum as you swing the double
00:39 - pendulum and you trace the path of the
00:41 - bottom point it makes these beautiful
00:43 - chaotic kind of insane patterns and you
00:46 - can see an image of it here from some
00:48 - other YouTube video that you could
00:49 - probably go and find and watch so this
00:51 - has been on the coding challenge list
00:53 - since June 24th 2016 and this most
00:59 - recently I looked at it and back in
01:01 - December and I found this wonderful
01:03 - reference and so oh look at this oh this
01:06 - is is this the reference I wanted to
01:08 - look at yeah so we can actually just
01:10 - let's look at this here let's we're
01:12 - basically I want to make this so ok so
01:16 - this is what I want to make right there
01:19 - there's the double pendulum so but
01:20 - really what I need is the formulas on
01:23 - this page so let's first establish let's
01:25 - establish for ourselves this diagram so
01:29 - what I need for a double pendulum is
01:33 - this I'm going to consider to be point
01:35 - zero zero then this I'm going to
01:40 - consider to be point x1y1 and this here
01:45 - and let me let me be more thoughtful
01:47 - about how I draw these lines this here
01:56 - I'm going to consider a point x2y2 so
02:00 - there are important variables here well
02:03 - there's a bunch of things
02:04 - there's the year that in theory there
02:05 - are two what you might call Bob's the
02:08 - Bob being this thing at the end of a
02:09 - pendulum so there's the
02:11 - mass of this one which is mass one
02:13 - there's the mass of this one which is
02:15 - mass - okay I also need to keep track of
02:19 - this length arm length the arm of the
02:22 - pendulum so I'm gonna call this one
02:23 - r1 and r2 I now I just realized that if
02:26 - you look at the web page of looking and
02:28 - they called it l1 and l2 but I'm gonna
02:30 - call it r1 because variable name L and
02:32 - code it looks like a 1 it's very
02:33 - confusing so r1 and r2 then what's
02:37 - really important is I have two angles I
02:39 - have this angle here theta one and then
02:43 - now what's the best way for me I think
02:46 - so let me draw it I have to get let me I
02:49 - I want to be able to see that angle so
02:51 - let me draw it out like this so this
02:55 - being fada to now this is x2 y2 and this
03:02 - is r2 and this is m2 okay
03:06 - I think I've got this pretty much right
03:08 - these are all the variables of my system
03:11 - the only thing that I really need to
03:12 - keep track of is theta 1 and theta 2 R 1
03:18 - and R 2 I'm going to be calculating
03:21 - where these points are based on those
03:24 - angles okay so this is this is the
03:26 - diagram so that means I'm gonna do this
03:28 - in processing that means I can start by
03:32 - having oh yeah I guess yeah I kind of
03:36 - that's this is I wouldn't might have
03:38 - been backwards about the theta 2 angle
03:40 - but I know it's fine it's fine it's fine
03:41 - I'm good I'm good let's see well we'll
03:43 - find out if we made a mistake later so
03:46 - I'm gonna say I need R 1 it's gonna be
03:48 - 100 oh I mean I mean I forgot I was in
03:51 - processing R 1 is 100 R 2 is also 100
03:54 - let's just have a mass 1 be 10 I'm
03:57 - making these up mass to be 10 you know
04:00 - there's also so then I the lengths amass
04:03 - and any this this point 0 0 so I'm gonna
04:08 - need okay so then I need set up then I
04:11 - need draw and I'm going to create a
04:14 - window that is let's make it 600 by 600
04:18 - and we'll say background 0 and then
04:24 - stroke
04:25 - let's make it back around 255 stroke
04:28 - zero let's make everything a little bit
04:30 - thicker so we can see it stroke wait -
04:32 - and now what do I need to do let's first
04:36 - Trant let's run this the first thing I
04:38 - want to do and if you want to move this
04:40 - over a little bit here the first thing
04:43 - that I want to do is I want the zero
04:45 - zero point to be like here in the middle
04:47 - so the way to do that so I'm just gonna
04:49 - use translate so I'm going to say
04:50 - translate to 300 comma 50 and then I'm
04:56 - gonna what I need to do is I've need to
04:58 - calculate X 1 and X 2 so X 1 equals we
05:03 - just need a little trigonometry right so
05:05 - how do I get to this point how do I get
05:08 - to this point well I need to know how
05:12 - what's my y offset and what's my X
05:15 - offset and you might realize now this is
05:18 - a little bit weird it's a little bit of
05:20 - a different scenario because X is
05:21 - actually across from the angle sine of
05:25 - that angle theta 1 equals x divided by R
05:30 - 1
05:30 - so X actually equals R 1 times the sine
05:34 - of theta 1 okay so now I need to I can
05:38 - calculate X 1 equals R 1 times what did
05:41 - I say sine of oh I don't have the angle
05:44 - so let me create two variables a 1 is 0
05:48 - a 2 angle 1 angle 2 sine of a 1 y 1
05:55 - equals R 1 times cosine of a 1 it's a
05:58 - little backwards than what you might see
05:59 - in a lot of other polar to Cartesian
06:01 - videos and then I'm gonna say line from
06:04 - 0 0 x 1 y 1 and then I'll draw a nice
06:07 - little lips there x 1 y 1 16:16 and you
06:13 - know I have this mass so I probably
06:14 - should actually draw of it relative to
06:16 - the mass so let's draw it like just call
06:18 - it m1 and then let's make sure I say
06:23 - fill 0 let's run this there we go so we
06:26 - can see this is the top of the pendulum
06:27 - and let's make the let's make it a
06:31 - little bit longer and a little bit
06:34 - bigger okay so that's good that's the
06:37 - top of the pendulum that
06:39 - looks right now what I need to do is
06:43 - calculate x2 which is our two times sine
06:47 - of a - the same exact math is going to
06:50 - apply our two times cosine of a - but
06:55 - it's offset from x1 right y1 x1 y1 right
07:04 - because this is going to calculate it
07:08 - according to this angle in the same way
07:09 - but the offsets the y offset and the X
07:13 - offset are relative to x1 y1 so I could
07:15 - use translators rotate but I'm just
07:17 - gonna add the offset in there and now to
07:20 - render that I should be able to say line
07:25 - now I want the line to go - let's be
07:28 - let's be I'm gonna be like so it'll
07:30 - retentive about this I want to start
07:32 - with x1 y1 x2 y2 and then draw that next
07:37 - ellipse and we should see there we go so
07:41 - this is looking good now let's just see
07:42 - am I crazy
07:44 - is this right so like for example
07:46 - there's no animation happening yet but
07:48 - if I were to say something like you know
07:50 - pi divided by 2 that's 90 degrees yeah
07:54 - okay so that's right and if I were to
07:56 - say like pi divided by 8 and PI divided
08:00 - by 4 that makes sense right so the angle
08:03 - is the angle and the length is what's
08:06 - controlling where everything is
08:08 - positioned and I could start doing weird
08:10 - stuff like I could just say like for no
08:12 - reason like a1 plus equal zero point one
08:16 - and you can see it's doing that so I in
08:18 - some ways I have but this is not the
08:20 - actual formulas for the mechanics of how
08:22 - a double pendulum now interestingly
08:24 - enough this is an interesting sketch
08:27 - just on its own because now I can have
08:29 - that go the other way and we can see
08:30 - well you know what's going on here so
08:33 - one thing I want to add to this just
08:34 - while we're here let me add the tracing
08:37 - pross prop let me add the tracing of the
08:40 - path and I'm gonna do this in a kind of
08:41 - funny way I'm gonna create a P graphics
08:43 - object and I'm gonna call it I'm gonna
08:46 - call it I'm in about canvas I kind of
08:51 - don't want to call canvas because when I
08:52 - make
08:52 - the p5.js version of this I don't want
08:55 - it to be canvas but I'm gonna do that
08:56 - anyway
08:57 - so I'm gonna say canvas equals create
08:59 - graphics 600 600 and then I'm gonna say
09:05 - inside draw I'm gonna say canvas dot
09:08 - begin I'm gonna do this at the end what
09:11 - I want to do basically and then I'm
09:13 - gonna draw the background no canvas top
09:15 - begin draw so this is an off-screen
09:19 - graphics context the same as the thing
09:21 - that you are seeing in the window but
09:23 - the reason why I want to use it is
09:25 - because I want to draw the background on
09:27 - it only once so I can have nice trails
09:33 - and then what I'm gonna do is at the end
09:37 - here I probably should have waited this
09:39 - to later I don't know why I'm doing this
09:41 - now but it's the order that I'm doing it
09:43 - in I'm gonna draw just a point at what I
09:48 - need to translate canvas translate and
09:52 - you do that same translation 350 so 300
09:57 - comma 50 and draw a point at X x2 y2 so
10:01 - I'll make it a line or something later I
10:04 - just want to see ok and now if at the
10:06 - beginning I actually draw that as the
10:09 - background image canvas 0 0 canvas dot
10:19 - stroke wait for canvas stroke 0 there we
10:28 - go so you can see this pattern that it's
10:30 - doing there's kind of like very similar
10:32 - to like to pull a road stuff because
10:34 - really what we have is just some
10:35 - oscillating going on but I want it to be
10:37 - an actual double pendulum
10:38 - so not just some arbitrary angle
10:40 - changing okay now so what's interesting
10:43 - what's going on here this is actually a
10:45 - 1 is changing by a value remember this I
10:49 - don't know if you remember this but if
10:50 - you've watched any of my other videos
10:51 - I've kind of got these physics engines
10:53 - in a lot of places the position changes
10:56 - by the velocity the velocity changes by
10:58 - the acceleration there's this concept of
11:00 - a derivative the change in
11:03 - overtime is the velocity the change in
11:06 - velocity over time is the acceleration
11:08 - or I can say a 1 so I could say
11:13 - something like a 1 velocity is point 1
11:15 - right let me let me declare some more
11:17 - variables so I want an A 1 velocity to
11:22 - be 0 and I want an A 2 velocity to be 0
11:26 - then I also want to have a 1
11:29 - acceleration to and have those B 0 as
11:32 - well so there we'll see the notation on
11:36 - that on that page for a second so what
11:37 - this is what I want to do I really want
11:39 - to have a 1 change by a 1 velocity a to
11:44 - change by a 2 velocity and then I also
11:48 - want to have a 1 velocity change by a 1
11:51 - acceleration a to velocity change by a 2
11:55 - acceleration now not being very
11:56 - thoughtful about time I'm just thinking
11:59 - of one frame as one unit of time so I'm
12:02 - going to do one adjustment to the angle
12:04 - where as you know if I'm really trying
12:06 - to be more accurate about this I might
12:08 - try to do several iterations of the math
12:09 - per frame that would make more sense
12:11 - later as I get a little further here but
12:13 - this should give me the structure from
12:15 - which to to do this so if I run this now
12:20 - once again it's not moving but let's
12:22 - just give a little let's give it a
12:24 - little bit of acceleration 0.01 let's
12:27 - make this one negative 0.001 because
12:32 - there now it's accelerating out of
12:34 - control really fast because those
12:35 - numbers are accumulating on each other
12:36 - but you can see this is kind of the idea
12:38 - I need to figure out what are those
12:40 - acceleration values of the angles and if
12:43 - you go and watch my simple pendulum
12:46 - video you'll see it's kind of an easy
12:47 - thing to calculate based on gravity
12:49 - really simple formula the thing about
12:51 - the double pendulum is and I'm not going
12:53 - to derive these formulas but as I scroll
12:55 - through this page it's going to actually
12:57 - attempt to derive those formulas of
12:59 - motion I'm just going to scroll down and
13:01 - get to the end here we go this is what
13:03 - I'm looking for these two this is what
13:05 - looks like double quotes is prime prime
13:07 - so theta 1 prime is velocity the angular
13:11 - velocity theta 1 prime prime is the end
13:14 - the acceleration so all I need to do no
13:16 - problem I'm just gonna implement these
13:19 - formulas in my code and we'll be done
13:21 - actually when I just end this video
13:22 - right now you do that I'll be back here
13:25 - okay you're probably still here did you
13:28 - pause the video and do it yourself this
13:29 - is gonna be um so I'm gonna I'm let's
13:31 - see what's the best way for me to do
13:32 - this what I'm gonna do is whoops I'm in
13:35 - the wrong place is I'm gonna move this
13:36 - over here I need a little more space I'm
13:38 - gonna actually just take a screenshot of
13:40 - this absurdly because I want to be able
13:42 - to see it and look at my code at the
13:45 - same time so I should be able to go now
13:48 - to the I don't need this open should be
13:51 - able to go to the desktop where I have
13:53 - that screenshot and I've got that up
13:56 - there now and let's lower my processing
14:01 - window to down here okay
14:05 - so let's find a place where I can
14:06 - actually implement this so I'll just do
14:10 - it at the top of draw theta1 angular 1 a
14:15 - equals now i just need to put all of
14:16 - that stuff in my code so what 10 when I
14:19 - see like a formula like this it's kind
14:22 - of like I don't want to write this all
14:23 - in one line of code it's gonna be crazy
14:24 - I like to break it up into parts so
14:26 - first of all there's definitely two
14:27 - parts there's the numerator which is the
14:29 - top of that in the denominator but
14:31 - there's also kind of parts of the
14:32 - numerator because there's like this
14:33 - whole thing - this whole thing - this
14:35 - whole thing so let me start doing it
14:37 - that way let me say float numerator 1
14:39 - equals negative G tonight do I have a
14:41 - variable called G so G is the universal
14:43 - gravitational constant I assumed that's
14:47 - just going to be 1 but we could play
14:48 - with that to change
14:49 - kind of like the strength of gravity
14:51 - there's a real-world number that that is
14:53 - but I don't care about for the purpose
14:55 - of this video so in a way I would have
14:57 - liked to take it out but I'm gonna leave
14:59 - it in there negative G times 2 what
15:02 - let's put parentheses 2 times m1 plus m2
15:06 - times sine of angle 1 so that's one
15:10 - thing the next one is and please those
15:13 - of you live following along tell me if I
15:16 - make a mistake here the next one is
15:18 - negative m2 times G times sine of angle
15:22 - 1 minus 2 times angle
15:25 - then the third part here is negative 2
15:30 - times sine angle 1 minus angle 2 times M
15:36 - - oh boy oh boy
15:40 - x okay hmm
15:42 - let's make this let's make the next
15:45 - thing M for which is oh and this so
15:49 - theta 2 prime is in my my notation is
15:53 - angle to underscore V I probably could
15:57 - have thought of a different name so it's
15:58 - the velocity times R 2 plus angle one
16:05 - underscore velocity o squared this is
16:09 - squared - oh my goodness
16:11 - so that's squared so angle two velocity
16:13 - times itself squared times R two plus
16:18 - angle one velocity times itself times R
16:23 - one times cosine of angle one minus
16:26 - angle two I think and there's be
16:29 - parentheses around this whole thing but
16:31 - since I made it its own thing I don't
16:32 - have to and then the denominator
16:35 - denominator is R one's gonna be little
16:41 - easier times two times M 1 plus M 2
16:45 - minus M two times cosine of two times
16:48 - angle one minus 2 times angle 2 okay so
16:55 - now assuming I didn't make a mistake
16:58 - which I'm sure I did angle one
17:00 - acceleration equals numerator 1 plus
17:04 - numerator 2 plus numerator 3 times times
17:09 - numerator 4 I think that's correct
17:13 - that's all the divided by denominator
17:15 - and parentheses around all of this oh ok
17:22 - I I almost want to just just do that
17:25 - like let's just run it with this and
17:27 - just say that angle to acceleration is 0
17:32 - and by the way this could be a local
17:34 - variable there's no reason to have this
17:36 - be a global variable because
17:37 - gonna get recalculated every frame so
17:39 - let's take these out here and let's just
17:42 - see like syntax wise does this even run
17:44 - oh boy
17:46 - float angle one oh I forgot to semicolon
17:52 - okay so this is promising why because
17:55 - that looks like a single pendulum now
17:57 - it's kind of spitting a little bit out
17:58 - of control
17:59 - so like probably going to want to add
18:02 - some dampening but this is right it's
18:03 - going in a perfect circle so I'm not
18:05 - totally insane I've got something that's
18:07 - working here that's kind of nice
18:08 - okay now time for formula number two and
18:12 - by the way somebody in the chat asked
18:15 - what crazy person thought up this
18:16 - formula nobody crazy thought it up
18:18 - somebody crazy calculated it probably
18:21 - not so crazy somebody who's really very
18:22 - thoughtful and kind and really likes
18:24 - pendulums and another video I'm sure
18:27 - could go through the math of this but I
18:29 - like sometimes I like it when I'm like
18:31 - oh the coding train is not about
18:32 - deriving the math just implementing it
18:34 - so today is a day for that so now I need
18:37 - to do well it's not going to let me read
18:40 - eclair these variables so let's do let's
18:45 - do let's just use them again whatever
18:47 - let's say two times sine of angle 1
18:51 - minus minus angle 2 times do I dare like
18:56 - keep going here I'm going to Derek keep
18:58 - going no no let's do the numerator 2
19:02 - equals angle 1 velocity squared times R
19:09 - times m1 plus m2
19:13 - okay that's 1 R 1 that's R 1 so easy to
19:19 - make a mistake here numerator 3 equals G
19:23 - times m1 plus m2 times cosine of angle 1
19:28 - ok numerator 4 equals angle 1 where am I
19:36 - looking
19:37 - no angle 2 V squared times R to 2 times
19:44 - m2 times cosine of angle 1 minus angle 2
19:47 - and if I look here at this
19:51 - these are the same right the
19:53 - denominators are the same the only thing
19:54 - that's different is l1 and l2 double
19:56 - check double check double check yes so I
19:58 - could copy paste this code here and
20:03 - bring it down here and just say r2 now
20:09 - this now equals write its numerator 1
20:15 - times numerator 2 plus numerator 3 plus
20:24 - plus numerator 4 divided by denominator
20:30 - oh my god what is the chance that this
20:36 - is actually correct what is the chance
20:42 - that this is correct
20:45 - very very oh oh oh I'm being told that I
20:48 - have some transcription errors make it
20:51 - denominator 2 I did that and a 2 a
20:56 - equals num1 x okay hold on hold on let's
21:02 - look at a 2 a num 1 x num2 now i'm one
21:08 - time zone 2 + num 3 plus number 4 I
21:11 - think that's fine I think I'm good oh
21:15 - there's a squiggly line here yeah num
21:19 - for is num 4 is 8 2 squared times R 2
21:27 - times M 2 times cosine of a 1 I think
21:30 - I'm good I think I'm good
21:36 - 34 I need a parentheses I think I'm good
21:40 - I'm gonna run it does that look right no
21:49 - okay something's wrong
21:51 - something is definitely wrong ok let's
21:54 - look at the let's let's look at the
21:57 - denominator L 2 times 2 times M 1 plus M
22:02 - 2 minus
22:03 - two times cosine of two times angle 1
22:06 - minus 2 times angle - that looks correct
22:08 - ah okay I'm seeing in the chat this I
22:16 - think I need to be more thoughtful oh
22:18 - there's a parenthesis oh this
22:21 - parenthesis goes all the way to there
22:24 - oh that's very wrong very very wrong
22:26 - thank you
22:27 - so this is this times all of that added
22:31 - together so this parenthesis needs to be
22:36 - here there we go I think now no no not
22:40 - in denominator numerator 4 that's why
22:44 - okay okay this numerator 4 no no no no
22:49 - no no not a numerator 4 I was doing so
22:53 - well
22:54 - it's in the end this parenthesis cause
22:59 - here there we go right because when I
23:01 - put this all together I need this thing
23:04 - times these 3 things added together with
23:07 - parenthesis around it and if I want to
23:08 - be really safe about this I'll put
23:10 - another parenthesis around it okay okay
23:13 - now okay okay
23:27 - all right that looks kind of like a
23:30 - double pendulum whoa
23:33 - now it's got quite a bounce to it I
23:37 - don't know I've actually done it right
23:40 - it is kind of spiraling out of control
23:43 - which I think maybe my I might have an
23:45 - issue that so let's think about what
23:49 - could be the problem here I don't think
23:52 - the order matters I've because putting
23:55 - it here is the same as you know just not
24:00 - doing it the first frame oh yeah well
24:04 - yes it would be I should put this is
24:07 - correct that this makes more sense to
24:09 - put here yeah I think I actually have
24:12 - this correct
24:14 - I think the issue is some oh that really
24:19 - just weird did that did I do something
24:22 - that fixed it
24:23 - oh yeah interesting
24:28 - oh that does matter I was thinking that
24:31 - this doesn't really matter but I I mean
24:33 - I definitely the the correct way to do
24:36 - it would be to adjust the velocity first
24:38 - based on the force which is the
24:40 - acceleration and then adjust the
24:41 - position somehow that seemed to have
24:44 - fixed it there's also some yeah so okay
24:47 - so let's actually get it to do so couple
24:50 - things one is I won a half I want to
24:55 - have previous x2 and previous x1 and
25:04 - what I want to do is I want to actually
25:09 - draw a line I want to trace the line
25:10 - from ech previous X to previous Y - is
25:16 - that what I put here previous x2
25:17 - previous Y to you and I'm gonna have
25:23 - these be can I say that no can't have a
25:28 - float so just like set them equal to
25:31 - negative 1 or something and so here what
25:35 - I want to do as soon as I as soon as I
25:38 - calculate this
25:40 - I want to save I would have to do it
25:45 - afterwards I want to say at the end I
25:49 - want to save the previous previous why
25:54 - to and I only want to draw the line if
25:57 - previous X 2 is not equal to negative 1
26:02 - I said a better way to like not draw
26:04 - that first line actually I could just
26:06 - say if frame count is greater than 1
26:12 - okay I just wanted to do that so I could
26:14 - least draw the full pack so let's
26:16 - actually have it start let's let's do a
26:17 - couple things remember one is let's have
26:21 - it start let's have a variable called
26:25 - Center X and Center Y and as soon as I
26:30 - set the size let's say Center x equals
26:33 - with divided by 2 and Center y equals 50
26:36 - that way I can reuse those Center
26:39 - ex-senator why because I need that also
26:42 - here Center X Center why I want to be
26:45 - able to see a bit more of the canvas so
26:47 - I'm gonna say like 900 oops
26:50 - Oh and why why is my background up with
26:57 - this needs to be the same size with
27:01 - height okay it's a little bit better now
27:05 - now let's actually have it start higher
27:07 - up let's have it start pi divided by 2
27:11 - pi divided by 2 let's see what happens
27:15 - here so this should be its and I missed
27:19 - I think this is the right pattern I
27:22 - don't know what initial settings to give
27:24 - it but it kind of looks like looks
27:26 - pretty simple similar to what I started
27:30 - with when I did that google image search
27:31 - right if you remember my Google image
27:34 - search at the beginning of this video
27:35 - this one out looks pretty similar to
27:40 - that so I think I have now done the
27:43 - double pendulum now how I know this
27:46 - thing is playing with the mass playing
27:49 - with the G value playing with the
27:50 - different are values playing with the
27:52 - color there is
27:54 - so much that you could do with this and
27:57 - you know I could also one thing that I
27:59 - think might be worth just noting here
28:01 - and I absolutely would like to also have
28:05 - this I think I want to have a much
28:07 - lighter trace right so I have this one
28:11 - thing a couple things that might be
28:12 - worth noting here is that what was I
28:18 - gonna say oh yeah I could add some
28:22 - dampening so one thing I could do is say
28:24 - like I could simulate this idea of like
28:26 - friction or air resistance by saying a 1
28:28 - that x equals 0.99 9 so it's always
28:32 - losing a little angular velocity every
28:35 - frame so we could do this so this should
28:40 - I mean it might take a very long time
28:42 - but this should eventually dampen those
28:44 - values so that it comes to arrest so
28:47 - that's something they sort of play with
28:48 - I mean certainly if I just to show that
28:50 - effect really strongly if I put like 0.9
28:52 - if it's losing 10% of its you can see
28:56 - that it's it's like it's almost as if
28:58 - it's like swinging through mud so that's
29:00 - one thing that we can kind of play with
29:02 - a kid stuff and when I when you make
29:05 - when this gets poured into p5.js as a
29:07 - JavaScript version could have sliders to
29:09 - play with all this stuff but you can see
29:10 - what that really does the dampening
29:12 - really causes it to not be able to swing
29:13 - so I'm gonna comment this out though and
29:16 - leave this in the code the other thing
29:17 - that I would do is you know what does it
29:19 - mean if the mass of these is 20 you know
29:22 - how does that affect the pattern that
29:24 - I'm gonna get what if I make the art the
29:27 - arm length of the first one like 50
29:30 - right and the second one like 400 you
29:35 - know this is sort of interesting what do
29:36 - I get what kind of pattern do I get here
29:38 - so there's so many possibilities so this
29:41 - come this is the end of this coding
29:43 - challenge the double pendulum coma
29:45 - challenge this I think is one which is
29:46 - really ripe for your variations up for
29:49 - your own take do your own twist on this
29:51 - how are you drawing it how are you
29:52 - visualizing it how you adding user
29:54 - interface controls is that the kind of
29:57 - thing that you make how do you make it
29:58 - interactive there's so many
29:59 - possibilities here
30:00 - how are you drawing the trail oh I got
30:03 - to stop so I hope you enjoyed this
30:05 - coding challenge I would not
30:07 - be super more gravity being told I could
30:10 - also change the force of gravity let me
30:12 - put this back up to something more
30:14 - reasonable right if I make gravity
30:16 - really strong you can see what kind of
30:18 - like craziness happens versus gravity
30:21 - really weak you can see an almost just
30:25 - more likely only kamancheh this double
30:27 - pendulum on the moon so to speak 3d
30:29 - version would be crazy I can't make a 3d
30:31 - version so I would love for you to make
30:34 - your variations of this it says share
30:36 - them with me the coding train comm
30:39 - actually now has a system a way for it's
30:41 - not the most obvious thing but it's tied
30:43 - to a github repository where you can
30:44 - submit a pull request go check that out
30:46 - there'll be a link in this video's
30:47 - description for how to do that and I
30:50 - will also have a JavaScript version of
30:52 - this that runs in the browser which the
30:54 - code will essentially look exactly the
30:55 - same so thanks for watching and I will
30:57 - see you wha in a future coding challenge
31:07 - you
