00:00 - okay here I have back I did a video
00:02 - about a binary search tree I don't know
00:06 - how well I did but I tried my best and
00:08 - now I'm going to definitely not do such
00:09 - a good job but I'm going to try to show
00:11 - you some steps on how you might think
00:13 - about visualizing the tree and I'm kind
00:16 - of good enough to observe this like a
00:17 - bunch of times but but I just do it a
00:18 - very simple way and I'm asking you the
00:20 - community those of you with visual
00:22 - challenge with creative ideas to make a
00:24 - more beautiful animated version of this
00:27 - with some kind of creative possibilities
00:29 - that I can't even think of so here we go
00:31 - let's try to get started here so first
00:35 - of all I have two p5.js library because
00:39 - I use nothing from p5 Jeff other than
00:41 - setup and no canvas but now I'm going to
00:44 - say create canvas 600 comma 400 and I'm
00:51 - going to say background 51 and I'm going
00:56 - to do this oh boy that's a big canvas
00:58 - okay that's better
00:59 - zoomed in a little bit okay I'm kind of
01:02 - running out of space here but let's move
01:04 - this a little bit over give me a little
01:06 - bit more space here okay so this is the
01:08 - canvas so now whenever I create a node
01:12 - let's actually have the node also get an
01:15 - x and a y and say this x equals x and
01:20 - this dot y equals y then perhaps well we
01:26 - could keep the Traverse I might I could
01:28 - also store all the nodes in an array to
01:30 - iterate through them but let's not do
01:31 - that okay so what do I want to do
01:33 - whenever I create a node where do I do
01:35 - that
01:36 - Oh add value okay if if root equals null
01:44 - so the root node should be the X should
01:50 - be width divided by two and so I'm not
01:53 - actually using the constructor here
01:55 - height divided by two so I'm just
01:57 - setting it directly so I have this
01:59 - option of when I create the note I could
02:02 - pass it in x and y or I could just set
02:04 - it but here I want to set it because I
02:05 - want to make the root node there now
02:08 - let's use this Traverse so the Traverse
02:11 - function in the node is
02:13 - right here which is visit so instead of
02:16 - in addition to console logging it let's
02:19 - just do Phil 255 text this value this
02:26 - Dex this not why this is sort of no
02:29 - stroke so let's just actually draw the
02:30 - text so let's run this look at this that
02:34 - root node is right there 68 now it's
02:36 - hard for you to see it but that's fine
02:38 - and I realize that I don't want I want
02:40 - the root to be at the top so let's make
02:42 - y 16 so we can see the root node is up
02:47 - at the top 4 which is all times to be
02:49 - the lowest node that's just a
02:50 - coincidence 76 is the root ok so now
02:53 - whenever I add a node so now when I add
02:59 - a value through otherwise I go to this
03:01 - top root add node so in add notice here
03:07 - where is that add node aha so this is
03:13 - where I actually set it to be this node
03:15 - left or this nodes right so if I want to
03:19 - do that now I could say if it's to the
03:21 - left if X should be this nodes X - I
03:27 - don't know 50 and it's Y should be this
03:33 - knows y plus 20 I'm just making up stuff
03:38 - and then when I create the right node it
03:43 - should be to the right
03:45 - but it's Y is still down so this is like
03:48 - a kind of rudimentary way of doing it
03:50 - right the root node gets the location
03:52 - and then I do the same thing whenever I
03:54 - add a node I look to where I'm adding it
03:56 - and I just grab that other nodes
03:58 - location and move it down to the left
04:00 - there's a lot of problems with this but
04:02 - it'll give us a basic idea look at that
04:04 - so and would be nice now to draw some
04:07 - lines between them and you can see how
04:09 - of this these are on top of each other
04:12 - so here's where I think I put it stop ah
04:17 - here's where I think I want to stop
04:19 - because I'm tired and I want you the
04:23 - community to figure out more interesting
04:24 - solutions so first of all what would be
04:27 - a way
04:27 - let's see if I draw the line even can I
04:29 - at least draw the line let's try to draw
04:31 - the line where do I where do I visit so
04:37 - I visit how do I know which one I
04:39 - previously in my Traverse where am i
04:45 - drawing it I heard he forgot under-under
04:48 - visit so this is where I draw it how do
04:53 - I know where it came from
04:55 - I don't so I would have to pass in here
05:01 - when I visit I would have to pass in a
05:05 - parent like where it came from in order
05:08 - to draw a line from the two different
05:11 - locations so visit from me visit from me
05:17 - and then in the tree visit from this dot
05:21 - route let's see if that works then now I
05:24 - could draw a line which goes from Paris
05:28 - ex parent dot Y to this dot X just out
05:32 - why and I need so this would need a
05:36 - stroke there we go so you can see this
05:41 - isn't so great let's at least draw like
05:43 - oh you know I should do I should say
05:45 - text-align:center and let's also draw a
05:50 - little ellipse and let's give it like a
05:57 - sighs whoops what do i do that's wrong
06:02 - here the lips the lips wait what's the
06:07 - error undefined text-align spelled
06:10 - text-align wrong text the line whoops no
06:15 - fill so we can see here I'm kind of
06:19 - getting started here ah this is good so
06:21 - you can see this is now the tree but I
06:24 - haven't done such a good job because you
06:27 - know these things shouldn't be so maybe
06:29 - they should be far apart and then closer
06:31 - a bit depending on the level
06:33 - you know if this has a lot of numbers in
06:35 - it like if I were to add a hundred
06:38 - numbers to this like this is a mess
06:40 - everything
06:41 - all overlapping everything else because
06:43 - the nodes next to each other have left
06:45 - in the right so here's where I'm going
06:47 - to stop this is giving you an inkling of
06:49 - an idea so what I am asking you the
06:51 - community watching this video this code
06:54 - will be on github will be a readme file
06:56 - there you can add your versions of it
06:58 - how can you do a more creative or
07:02 - effective way of visualizing this tree
07:04 - with proper spacing what might be some
07:05 - algorithm to figure out the proper
07:07 - spacing you know you could use physics
07:08 - even like what if you use spring forces
07:10 - between all these nodes some kind of
07:13 - repulsion forces to like have it figure
07:17 - itself out that's known as a force
07:18 - directed graph by the way I also think
07:20 - it'd be really wonderful to see an
07:21 - animation so what if you created here
07:24 - something you could do you create a
07:25 - sketch where there's nothing and you
07:27 - have every time you press a button it
07:29 - adds something to the tree and you see
07:30 - it animate to its correct spot and then
07:32 - you could hit a button called Traverse
07:34 - and it animates through the tree in the
07:36 - recursive fashion so what type of
07:37 - animated ways could you explain trees so
07:41 - I would love for anybody to do that
07:43 - share those projects would be if you
07:45 - want to this is actually if this is also
07:47 - a video that's with a course that I'm
07:50 - anyway just look in this video's
07:52 - description there'll be links to all the
07:54 - places to look to contribute your stuff
07:56 - ok so an algorithm get n items per level
08:02 - and separate them evenly yes so one
08:04 - thing you could look at is can you look
08:05 - through the tree to figure out how many
08:07 - items are our perks level and that's how
08:09 - you figure out the spacing so that's a
08:10 - great clue there and thank you Alka from
08:12 - the chat alright I will see all of you
08:14 - another time in another video in another
08:16 - place not too far in the future I hope
08:19 - and have a good I would say weekend
08:21 - because right now it's gonna be a
08:22 - weekend for me but you who knows you're
08:23 - watching this like from some bunkered
08:26 - some underground place where it's
08:28 - Tuesday morning or something or maybe
08:29 - you're just on in a field
08:31 - I imagine the fields with flowers around
08:32 - you in the wind blowing if that's the
08:34 - case play some frisbee frolic smell the
08:37 - roses forget about this binary tree
08:38 - stuff see you later
08:40 - [Music]
