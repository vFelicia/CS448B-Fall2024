00:00 - hello this is a video tutorial about
00:03 - custom shapes and I am showing you on
00:06 - this webpage
00:07 - a much better explanation of how custom
00:10 - shapes that I will give you this is
00:11 - actually rune Matson's online book
00:14 - called programming design systems I
00:15 - think I might have referenced this
00:16 - before it's got an excellent chapter on
00:19 - color at rune mats and on twitter rune
00:22 - is amazing there's lots of really
00:24 - interesting stuff with graphic design
00:25 - and code for graphic design and so this
00:28 - this web page really will walk you
00:30 - through the this idea of how you can
00:32 - think about a shape as having different
00:35 - vertices again this is not my work this
00:37 - is room Madison's work but this is what
00:39 - I want to cover what does this kind of
00:41 - code mean and even better like what are
00:44 - some things you can do with that so I
00:46 - will let you I'm gonna link to this page
00:48 - you can just stop watching this video
00:50 - and click on it and read it but if you
00:51 - want to keep watching I'm gonna kind of
00:53 - give you my own take on this sort of
00:54 - stuff what I'm talking about is custom
00:56 - shapes so what do I mean by custom
00:58 - shapes so you might be familiar with a
01:01 - rectangle looks like this or perhaps a
01:04 - circle also known as an ellipse which
01:07 - looks like this
01:08 - there is a line which looks like this
01:11 - and a point which looks like this and a
01:14 - triangle which looks like this and I
01:16 - think this might be everything so there
01:17 - are a list of defined primitive shapes
01:22 - primitive geometry set kinds of polygons
01:24 - set kinds of shapes that you could call
01:26 - with a function and draw on p5 okay
01:29 - let's start with something simpler what
01:30 - if I wanted to do this shape so this
01:35 - shape is we can think of it as a polygon
01:37 - a shape with many sides and a polygon
01:40 - can be defined by its vertices the
01:42 - vertices being each of these points that
01:45 - connects the sides and this is actually
01:47 - one two three four five so actually if
01:49 - you have a polygon with four arbitrary
01:51 - signs like this you can actually do this
01:54 - with the quad function the quad function
01:57 - 2p5 are processing both of all this
02:00 - codes for processing or p5 allows you to
02:02 - specify four points but what I want to
02:05 - do is make a custom shape so the only
02:07 - way for me to do this that I know of at
02:09 - least is to use a function called begin
02:11 - shape
02:13 - and use a function called n shape so if
02:19 - I use these functions begin shape and n
02:21 - shape what I can do is to in between
02:24 - begin and end i can set any number of
02:27 - arbitrary vertices so I can say vertex
02:33 - vertex over and over again now I could
02:36 - do this if fur and processing this will
02:38 - actually also work in 3d and there's a
02:40 - piece shape object and all sorts of
02:42 - fancy stuff you could do but I just want
02:43 - to look at it from the simple 2d lens
02:45 - that we're doing in p5 and so so this is
02:49 - the basic idea
02:50 - begin shape and this indentation is
02:52 - unnecessary I'm putting it there just
02:54 - sort of for visual effect but this is
02:56 - the idea now so let's take a look at
02:58 - that and make sure it works so I'm gonna
03:02 - come over here
03:03 - and whoops sorry everybody that's the
03:05 - wrong window I'm gonna say begin shape
03:08 - and I'm gonna say vertex I'm just gonna
03:10 - make up some points 150 vertex 220
03:16 - vertex 200 100 uh vertex 50 I'm not very
03:22 - good at picking numbers I need my random
03:23 - number book vertex 25 50 I have no idea
03:28 - what I've just done let's say n shape
03:30 - and now I'm gonna hit refresh and look
03:33 - there it is so in theory that's my shape
03:37 - and I wasn't very thoughtful about the
03:38 - vertices and the order the order does
03:40 - really matter and we can see if I did
03:42 - something weird with the order cuz this
03:44 - shape can be filled or stroked in the
03:47 - same way that by that I mean setting the
03:50 - outline color or the fill color so I
03:52 - could say stroke 255 and Phil no Phil
03:57 - just to sort of see no Phil Phil no Phil
04:00 - no Phil no Phil for you we can see I am
04:05 - so that's it so look at that so I maybe
04:07 - I didn't do anything too crazy those are
04:08 - all the points notice how you could with
04:10 - no fill you can actually think of this
04:11 - as a path so it could be a shape that's
04:13 - filled and enclosed or it could be a
04:15 - path and incidentally it if I wanted to
04:18 - close it right I could say oh let me put
04:20 - the first point again now it's closed
04:22 - but that's kind of silly right but
04:24 - actually I can do
04:25 - is just right the argument closed in
04:28 - here and now you can see it closed it
04:32 - automatically I'm gonna take that out
04:33 - now one thing I should mention is there
04:36 - actually is other stuff that can go in
04:38 - here maybe I need to come back in a
04:39 - whole separate video to go through all
04:41 - those possibilities but I can specify
04:43 - the kind of shape like if I there's
04:45 - something called a triangle strip which
04:47 - likes if I give it a whole bunch of
04:48 - points it'll put a whole bunch of
04:49 - triangles in between all those things
04:51 - and I have a feeling that if I go to I'm
04:53 - gonna go to the processing documentation
04:55 - because I know that'll come up begin
04:58 - shaped processing we could see a lot of
05:00 - those possibilities here right lines
05:04 - triangles like now if I use those points
05:06 - it's not one shape but it's through
05:08 - every three vertices we'll make a
05:09 - separate triangle triangle strip we'll
05:11 - connect it with a bunch of triangles
05:12 - triangle fan you could use quads you can
05:15 - use and I think I use this in like the
05:18 - Perlin noise terrain challenge and a
05:19 - bunch of my different coding challenges
05:21 - but I'm gonna be in this video I just
05:23 - want to keep things simple and I just
05:25 - want to use vertex so there we go so
05:30 - that's the idea now there's two things
05:32 - that I want to mention here number one
05:34 - is what would be interesting for me to
05:36 - do is come up with an algorithm that
05:38 - sets all these vertices you know what's
05:40 - the point really of me manually setting
05:42 - these vertices more likely I might want
05:44 - to do something like I'm gonna do this
05:45 - really quickly like what if I were to
05:47 - say for let a equal zero and okay so
05:54 - incidentally I'm using the for loop so
05:56 - for some reason to watch this video
05:57 - before I used for loop you have to go
05:59 - back and watch the Lucas video I should
06:01 - probably just stop saying that I'm gonna
06:02 - say a is less than 360 a plus equals ten
06:06 - and then what I'm going to do and this
06:08 - is I'm going to use something called
06:09 - polar to Cartesian coordinate
06:10 - transformation this is a little bit of
06:12 - an aside but this is worth it I don't
06:14 - know if this is worth doing I'm gonna
06:15 - say let X equal just to demonstrate the
06:18 - idea 100 times sine of a let y equals
06:23 - 100 times cosine of a plus 200 plus 200
06:29 - and then I'm gonna say vertex I have a
06:35 - reason why I'm doing this actually I'm
06:37 - gonna say vertex XY
06:39 - let's just see what happens yeah I got
06:41 - something crazy well I said all these
06:43 - vertices all over the place so what I'm
06:45 - actually doing is something called polar
06:46 - to Cartesian coordinates for information
06:48 - I'll link to a video that goes over in
06:50 - more detail but basically if I have this
06:52 - angle a what I want is to just keep
06:55 - changing that angle a to set a whole
06:57 - bunch of vertices around the circle and
06:59 - I can use cosine and sine trigonometry
07:01 - math to get all those points and I'll
07:03 - link to a video that goes through that
07:04 - in more detail but one of the reasons
07:07 - why this worked really weirdly is I
07:09 - didn't set the angle mode to degrees
07:13 - because I'm thinking about the full way
07:15 - around the circle is 360 degrees and
07:17 - it's using a radians which is a
07:18 - different by default different form of
07:20 - measurement so now we can see there it
07:22 - is and I want to say close so now I want
07:28 - it let me actually say let spacing equal
07:31 - 50 I'm gonna have this be spacing and we
07:35 - can see that's what I get now then
07:36 - what's interesting about this is I'm now
07:38 - gonna put this in to draw and I can have
07:48 - spacing be variable so I'm going to say
07:51 - spacing equals and I just did that's how
07:53 - I did this far Matic motion challenge
07:55 - that was a disaster I could have that
07:56 - value oscillate oh let's do this I'm off
07:59 - the beaten path this is really just a
08:01 - tutorial about custom shapes but I'm
08:03 - gonna use a sine wave in it which might
08:05 - be a bad idea but I'm just gonna do it
08:06 - anyway so I'm gonna say I'm gonna I'm
08:11 - gonna have a variable called T and was
08:14 - set equal to zero
08:15 - Len Len Len Len let me be more simple
08:18 - about this
08:18 - okay let's spacing equal map Mouse X
08:22 - which goes between 0 and width 2 between
08:28 - what I want the spacing view for like at
08:30 - 5 degrees and 100 degrees so let's at
08:34 - least see this work whoa oh I forgot to
08:38 - draw the background in here so let me
08:40 - put the background in draw so you can
08:43 - see right I'm getting I'm changing that
08:48 - angle so I'm slowly increasing the
08:50 - resolution and the sir
08:50 - so the point that I wanted to show this
08:52 - to you is not because this is some
08:54 - beautiful pattern that you should use
08:55 - but the reason why you might use custom
08:58 - shapes and said vertices is actually
09:00 - gonna have an algorithm to find those
09:01 - vertices so what if you wanted to make a
09:03 - bubble a cloud so I actually have a
09:05 - coding trained community project about
09:08 - making a cloud which I'll also link to
09:10 - in here which this could form the basis
09:12 - I think I've done stuff with a curling
09:13 - noise blob coding challenge at one point
09:15 - that this also relates to so there's a
09:17 - lot of possibilities here what I was
09:18 - gonna do was use a sine wave to have
09:21 - this feel like it's breathing SPAC and
09:23 - forth back and forth so that's maybe at
09:25 - something that you should try as an
09:27 - exercise after this video so what I want
09:30 - to do I'm going to leave this here but
09:33 - I'm gonna comment this out again and I
09:34 - want to just talk about one other thing
09:37 - so here we go remember this weird shape
09:40 - that I created this shape is a polygon
09:44 - that has a set of vertices but in
09:47 - addition to vertex there's actually
09:49 - something called curve vertex that I can
09:51 - call now there's also something called
09:53 - bezzie a vertex and bezzie a vertex is a
09:56 - kind of curve vertex for a special kind
09:58 - of curve called a Bezier curve and
09:59 - actually the patrons custom shape page
10:02 - goes through that in detail I'm gonna
10:04 - say Bezier curves for like another video
10:05 - because I don't know if I understand
10:07 - that at this moment so I have to go read
10:09 - runes excellent description and then
10:11 - come back to it but curve vertex what
10:15 - curve vertex does is it says having like
10:17 - a hard edge here let's try to curve
10:19 - around that edge but here's the thing I
10:22 - should probably make this a separate
10:23 - video but I'm in this video so you have
10:25 - to be watching all the way at the end of
10:27 - this video here's the thing that's
10:30 - tricky and I'm gonna there's gonna be
10:32 - some magic erasing in a second that's
10:33 - gonna happen here so one of the
10:35 - trickiest things about working with
10:36 - curves is that you're gonna suddenly
10:38 - discover when you use curve vertex
10:41 - points just disappear why let's say I
10:45 - have these three points now we could
10:49 - look at this and we could say to
10:50 - ourselves like I kind of know what I
10:52 - meant I want to draw this curve but if
10:56 - you think about it more there's actually
10:58 - no way for the computer to know how to
11:00 - draw this curve without more information
11:03 - cuz why couldn't it be like this or
11:09 - something that's that's a little bit
11:11 - weird we try it again why couldn't it be
11:13 - like this this would be a valid curve
11:18 - and the difference is how do I enter the
11:20 - curve I've kind of done a poor job of
11:22 - drawing this but I think the next thing
11:23 - I'm going to do is and make it more
11:24 - clear what if there was like a secret
11:26 - point right over here that said how to
11:28 - enter this curve or the secret point was
11:30 - over here that said how to enter the
11:32 - curve and up here it would be over here
11:33 - right this is gonna look different if
11:36 - there's so curves require additional
11:40 - points that control the entry and exit
11:43 - of the curve Dwight right should
11:46 - identity to curb and like come down here
11:48 - do we need to curve and like end up over
11:49 - here and so it can be really confusing
11:52 - and but you have to be aware of this so
11:55 - let's actually go and look at the code
11:56 - and see if we can make this work
11:58 - and let me simplify things actually let
12:02 - me actually make up some specific
12:03 - vertices so I'm gonna say vertex what
12:08 - what's the size of the window it's 200
12:10 - 200 so I'm going to say vertex 10 200
12:14 - 150 and then and next actually make this
12:19 - 100 200 and then 300 200 oh and I don't
12:24 - know what I'm doing I'm putting it all
12:25 - in one line vertex I don't can you see
12:27 - this bottom down here I want three
12:29 - vertices okay and now let's take a look
12:35 - at this oh do I have clothes I want to
12:38 - take out clothes and I messed up the
12:42 - middle one I want this to be at 200 so
12:45 - this is those are my three vertices so I
12:47 - want to make this a curve so a couple
12:51 - things one is let me just draw these
12:52 - points so we can see them separately
12:59 - also 300 200 I mean this is very
13:04 - redundant what I'm doing
13:06 - strokeweight for and then stroke whoops
13:12 - then let's do stroke wait one okay so I
13:17 - can see points there so I'm gonna change
13:19 - this the curve vertex and you're gonna
13:21 - see what I need
13:22 - curve vertex and I don't see anything
13:30 - anymore now I should have done this with
13:33 - more than I should do this with four
13:35 - points so let's make this one fifty 50
13:39 - and 250 like 60 or something so you're
13:46 - gonna see oh boy let's and that's also
13:49 - my apologies let's also put these as the
13:53 - actual points were drawing and where
13:59 - where does this go whoops what would I
14:03 - say 150 I'm one fifty fifty and two
14:07 - fifty sixty so you can see these points
14:14 - are actually controlling how this curve
14:16 - looks and there could be many more
14:17 - points it's just controlling the entry
14:18 - of the curve so like what if I made this
14:20 - point Mouse X Mouse Y this is what I'm
14:22 - trying to demonstrate Mouse X took me a
14:25 - while to get to this but Mouse X Mouse Y
14:27 - and now I'm gonna make that first point
14:29 - Mouse X Mouse Y so you can see as I move
14:35 - this around it changes of zoom in a
14:38 - little bit more it changes the entry to
14:40 - the curve and actually this is an
14:42 - interesting way to make something
14:43 - interactive like imagine of this
14:45 - oscillated up and down it's almost like
14:47 - this wiggling string or something so
14:49 - again as you're building these custom
14:52 - shapes this shape now is only those two
14:54 - points right if I were to say close you
15:01 - know oh interestingly enough it's like I
15:04 - look it actually connected it all the
15:06 - way around to the first point so the
15:07 - first point is controlling wow this is
15:09 - kind of crazy this is kind of a nice so
15:11 - you can imagine creating some
15:12 - interesting animation by just wow
15:15 - clothes really made the interesting if
15:17 - you do
15:18 - this whole problem kind of goes away I
15:20 - don't the problem but it doesn't enter
15:21 - it comes around to the end so that's
15:23 - kind of interesting I just discovered
15:24 - that now so you can see the difference
15:26 - if I use clothes because it adds the
15:29 - point the another thing that you can do
15:30 - often which is sort of the same thing is
15:33 - I could duplicate the last point twice
15:37 - so that's sort of like I that last point
15:41 - is also the control point for yourself
15:43 - so you can see it's not changing but I
15:45 - am including the first point twice so I
15:47 - could do that also like it could include
15:48 - the first point twice instead of Mouse X
15:51 - Mouse Y and now I kind of have whoops
15:55 - whoops I that's not the first point I
15:58 - could sorry if there was a different
16:01 - first point which was originally one
16:05 - hundred two hundred right so if I'd have
16:10 - that twice and get rid of mouse X mouse
16:13 - Y this can also be a strategy so it's
16:16 - kind of like just duplicate the first
16:18 - point and duplicate the last point but
16:19 - you don't have as much control I would
16:20 - need yet another point right like this
16:24 - point the mouse to control that so you
16:29 - can see now I could control this with
16:30 - the mouse so there's so many
16:32 - possibilities I'm sorry that I kind of
16:33 - went off the deep end then with like
16:35 - messing around with this but the point
16:37 - is and also incidentally I can mix curve
16:41 - vertex and vertex now let's see if we
16:44 - can make this more obvious well maybe
16:46 - that doesn't work so I'm pretty sure you
16:48 - can do that in processing I'm going to
16:49 - investigate if that works in p5 or not
16:51 - but the idea being that I can mix summer
16:55 - curbs summer jagged so to recap custom
16:59 - shapes are shapes that you just are
17:02 - polygons or paths that you define by a
17:06 - set of vertices you can make you can you
17:09 - can have them be tiled by certain kinds
17:10 - of quad strips or triangle strips or
17:12 - that kind of thing you can have curved
17:14 - vertices or regular vertices curved if
17:17 - you have curved you need to have control
17:18 - points for the curve and the reason for
17:22 - doing that is quite possibly more likely
17:25 - because you want to have something more
17:30 - dynamic oh and look I connected the
17:32 - in this weird crazy way so here's the
17:33 - like ending Frankenstein thing of this
17:37 - like weird hard-code tip and circle
17:40 - something wanted mention actually before
17:42 - I wrap up with the computer is that you
17:44 - might be asking yourself like well
17:46 - what's the math that calculates this
17:49 - curve well there are different kinds of
17:51 - mathematical functions to figure out how
17:52 - a curve goes between two different
17:55 - points I mentioned a Bezier curve
17:57 - there's a specific kind of bezzie a
17:58 - function and it works pretty differently
18:00 - than this but it it is something you
18:02 - could look at but this is actually known
18:04 - as a Catmull this this is using p5 and
18:07 - use the Catmull wrong spline spline
18:11 - being kind of another word for curve and
18:13 - these are people's names who came up
18:14 - with this algorithm so I'll try to
18:16 - include a link to the historical
18:18 - information about the Catmull rom spline
18:20 - and I apologize if I spell that or said
18:22 - that wrong so I hope you make what if
18:24 - you're if you don't know what to make
18:25 - from this take a look at the link to the
18:27 - cloud community cloud repository I mean
18:31 - you might be watching this a year in the
18:32 - future hopefully it'll still be there
18:33 - but this is a project that's happening
18:34 - in 2017 for processing day which is
18:38 - October 21st 2017 for the name tags and
18:42 - processing day so if you're interested
18:43 - in consuming to that and I hope you
18:45 - enjoyed this tutorial thanks for
18:46 - watching
