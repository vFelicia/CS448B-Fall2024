04:39 - gimbal stabilizer thing there we go oh
04:45 - whoa
04:48 - so people are asking how do you find out
04:50 - the details about a particular project
04:53 - and what I'll do is once this video is
04:57 - published I will provide links to
05:03 - information about all these projects
05:06 - yeah I should have given a warning I
05:08 - guess although if you're watching a
05:09 - video on YouTube maybe you don't need a
05:11 - warning
05:15 - [Music]
05:26 - this is really something inter inter
05:30 - interactive I'll ask the question when
05:32 - we get out people are asking if this is
05:34 - interactive I think it's a
05:35 - pre-programmed sequence as ended oh it
05:42 - started again okay you see the mic right
05:52 - okay it's a quite warm in here actually
05:55 - I'm going to try to attempt to leave now
05:57 - oh let me show you guys where the exit
05:59 - is the back up here you can see maybe
06:04 - we're going to find out
06:05 - oh this cable keeps going in front of
06:07 - the camera this is the issue I'm going
06:10 - to just take it I'm gonna untape it hold
06:11 - on I'm having a separate technical
06:15 - issues nothing to do with you yeah this
06:16 - is better okay so I'm going to now hand
06:21 - jarred the camera I just hold it from
06:23 - here yeah yeah that's good and then you
06:26 - can take this mic okay
06:34 - [Applause]
06:35 - put my shoes back on this is me but that
06:38 - was really intense I've been in there
06:40 - before them it's getting a swarm in
06:43 - there it's getting very warm yeah it's
06:48 - the lights are people were asking if
06:51 - it's interactive and it is someone it's
06:55 - responsive I think it's better than
06:57 - interactive so if you reach out towards
06:59 - the lights they did more brighten but
07:02 - you have to get sort of close to them
07:03 - phenomenal interaction is just to be
07:08 - thank you and so what I'm going to do
07:10 - afterwards as I mad at this video get
07:12 - archived and I'm going to try to put
07:14 - links to
07:19 - it
07:21 - it's not really working to my liking
07:24 - okay ah there we go I think we're good
07:26 - now okay
07:29 - it's what it's supposed to be yeah okay
07:33 - can we take a look at this project

07:46 - called an Amelia consult oh it's a
07:48 - gesture based performance piece where
07:51 - human beings wearing masks animal masks
07:54 - move their hands frantically to generate
07:56 - music and how does it like gee so do you
08:01 - it's a bit for a performance yes yes
08:03 - it's a performance piece today it's
08:05 - going to happen at 5:00 and 7:30 p.m.
08:07 - and there'll be one before five okay so
08:11 - maybe if we are still if I'm still doing
08:12 - this at five I should come back down yes
08:14 - or if there's enough audience I can do
08:17 - an impromptu I hear the whistling
08:21 - happening okay we're gonna go for gonna
08:22 - go to the whistling all right I hear
08:27 - something crazy
08:28 - I've been happening in the window over
08:30 - here so we're gonna go over here
08:35 - and I'm not sure what's going on but
08:38 - something is happening
09:23 - can you by any chance 6wu can you
09:27 - explain what's going on your name
09:29 - I'm Jason Beck so this is CNC assisted
09:32 - music so we have can control the machine
09:36 - going X Y & Z and I provide the air my
09:39 - accompaniment provides it chooses what
09:42 - notes to play and we just try to get
09:44 - through without me passing out what
09:48 - tells what's the longest performance
09:49 - you've done so far I sure wish I could
09:51 - time it out I went a little black in the
09:53 - middle of it so I can't honestly say but
09:55 - probably around six minutes is probably
09:57 - the longest I could probably last
09:59 - awesome thank you alright CNC assisted
10:07 - music Wow
10:11 - hey how are you this is I'm live
10:14 - streaming right now another bout of
10:16 - insanity
10:25 - a - so will you just move the mouse
10:27 - there you can make it let's say make it
10:29 - to be one if v1 is going to be this one
10:31 - right here alright okay so it's going to
10:33 - go and move there and go down into it
10:35 - okay then you can choose the next one so
10:38 - what you have control over is how long
10:40 - it's going to be in that position okay
10:41 - and how far you want it to travel each
10:43 - of these notes have different size pipe
10:45 - so they create slightly different pitch
10:46 - all of them super annoying okay okay
10:49 - that's how we're going to work alright
10:50 - in my pet my job is just not the pass
10:52 - out I'm going to put on headphones they
10:54 - don't do anything other than make me
10:55 - look cool okay okay we good oh my god
11:03 - [Music]
11:04 - we're gonna watch a little bit more and
11:06 - then I'll move on to another project
11:10 - [Music]
11:33 - okay we're gonna move on now thank you
11:36 - let's see what else I think we're gonna
11:39 - go upstairs oh there's an elevator do I
11:42 - dare go in the elevator I don't think so
11:44 - I'm gonna take the stairs I'm afraid to
11:46 - go in an elevator with a lot of people
11:47 - this I'm going up the stairs oh no I do
11:59 - actually yes but I
12:01 - oh yeah well here to the stairs I'm now
12:03 - walking up the stairs this is riveting I
12:06 - don't I don't know if I should narrate
12:09 - this or just let it be a nice silent
12:11 - walk up the stairs how steady by the way
12:16 - up poor connection so one thing is
12:18 - there's probably not the best Wi-Fi here
12:19 - in the stairwell we're going to we're
12:24 - going to the fourth floor what is this -
12:26 - oh my god - more flights that go okay
12:33 - I'm not so sure this gimbal thing is
12:36 - really worth it because this stuff
12:37 - attached to it which i think is really
12:39 - messing it up I probably need to put the
12:40 - counterweight on
12:47 - to go this way come on let's do this
12:53 - there we go uh here we go that's better
12:54 - okay
12:57 - we're we'll be going inside in just a
13:01 - moment you have your idea you don't have
13:02 - your idea my idea to get in the door
13:08 - [Music]
13:15 - okay
13:16 - now we're inside okay let's find some
13:21 - other stuff to look at is this thing on
13:24 - it is here's the wooden mirror by Danny
13:28 - Rosen this is not a current ITP show
13:32 - project but this is a has been here for
13:34 - almost 20 years now this is the new
13:36 - version of it it's actually what it runs
13:38 - with a Kinect which you can see up at
13:39 - the top you can see my reflection here
13:43 - right I'm that's me I'm going to stand
13:46 - back a poor connection and I can move to
13:48 - the right and to the left to the left
13:52 - and to the right okay now that I've had
13:56 - a chance to catch my breath from walking
13:57 - up the stairs all right here we are
14:02 - I'm live who wants to show we look at
14:04 - some projects so we have our fortune
14:06 - told first okay we're gonna have our
14:08 - fortune told down hold on I'm really
14:10 - having trouble with this thing that's
14:11 - supposed to stabilize the camera but you
14:15 - know I think
14:16 - need to recalibrate it but it does keep
14:20 - it stable alright alright so tell me and
14:23 - tell me about your project my name is
14:24 - Paul SEO juice and this is a project
14:28 - called divine pixels and it's a series
14:30 - of experiments that takes ancient
14:32 - fortune-telling rituals and makes them
14:34 - contemporary by infusing different
14:36 - aspects of our digital culture into them
14:38 - that's my project cool so what can I
14:41 - have my fortune told what do I have to
14:43 - do so we will I'll shuffle the cards for
14:46 - you since you're holding all this stuff
14:50 - and then we're just gonna you're gonna
14:56 - so this is aa reddit tarot cards um that
15:02 - we're gonna be reading on you you made
15:04 - you made these I mean I made yeah not
15:07 - the process but I made the rocks and
15:09 - this and this no but the tarot cards you
15:11 - redditor cards don't exist that's your
15:13 - own adventure yes that's mine
15:15 - and do you want do you want to pour
15:16 - Kartik a pool one couple one I think
15:18 - it's for it to be legitimate I have to
15:20 - be so this is just for today how today's
15:24 - gonna go okay you got for us so
15:31 - basically you're gonna have a great day
15:33 - filled with love and excitement and lots
15:37 - of fluffy puppy kisses perfect that's
15:42 - just what I was hoping for
15:44 - that is your fortune for two days you
15:50 - have emoji runes so these are rocks that
15:53 - have emojis edge attend to them and then
15:55 - there's two different projects here one
16:00 - is you reading your fortune based on the
16:04 - maps of your hand and the other one is
16:07 - reading your fortune based on your
16:09 - Instagram so that's it so I can cool oh
16:17 - the Instagram yeah my Instagram though
16:19 - is private yes sir I can do mine if you
16:22 - want yes sure so you would what you
16:28 - would do is you basically you would type
16:30 - in your handle and then you would just
16:32 - hit submit and then it posts the latest
16:35 - image from your Instagram that uses one
16:38 - of the seven most popular hashtags it
16:41 - extracts the three main dominant colors
16:43 - and based on those colors it chooses
16:45 - words and it generates your fortune
16:46 - awesome and how does it generate the
16:49 - text based on the words and then I'm
16:52 - using a different Cup different corpus
16:54 - and I'm doing a Markov chain and it's
16:56 - and it's kind of generating this
16:58 - fantastic that's the project okay thank
17:02 - you I was looking at the iPad when you
17:05 - wait
17:06 - I really gotten the worst camera
17:08 - operator I'm now develop discovering
17:10 - okay all right Michelle can you tell me
17:14 - about your name even I just said it and
17:15 - your project my name is Michelle and my
17:18 - project is called hidden in plain sight
17:19 - it is an installation that shares the
17:22 - stories of New York Street vendors
17:23 - through interacted 3d printed sculptures
17:26 - all the vendors in their cards I'm going
17:32 - to try now I think to get a look at the
17:35 - at the different sculptures can you tell
17:36 - me about them as I sew so this is a
17:39 - series of three portraits this is Danny
17:42 - this is his card
17:44 - this is Tito also known as the dosa man
17:46 - from Washington Square Park might
17:48 - recognize him and this is Ana she the
17:53 - name of a woman from Ecuador you were
17:56 - too fast my name is Ana
18:00 - she's an Ecuadorian woman from from who
18:03 - sells her family's in Queens and the
18:06 - idea of the project is to share all the
18:09 - stories behind the street food of New
18:12 - York that we don't usually get to know
18:14 - and understand because we these are
18:17 - people who are part of our daily life
18:18 - but at the same time who we don't know
18:20 - much about and it's a community of
18:23 - immigrants of people who come from all
18:25 - over the world and I I believe that one
18:29 - of the reasons that Street food in New
18:31 - York is so great is because it's so
18:32 - diverse and it's made by people who come
18:35 - from all over the place so yeah so I
18:37 - have the 3d printed sculptures and then
18:40 - you can press the button in your okay so
18:46 - in their own voices and see them
18:48 - okay I'm gonna try to press the button
18:50 - here okay thank you
18:54 - oh wow look at that right unfortunately
19:05 - lighting wise doesn't really show up but
19:06 - oh there we go if I get a little closer
19:07 - so it's projection mapped onto the
19:10 - sculpture so the visuals changed as the
19:18 - sari and hold and have your subjects
19:25 - been here to see your projects this is
19:28 - my thesis project here ATP and this guy
19:31 - came to my thesis presentation and he
19:35 - brought food for everyone who was here
19:38 - he brought vegan samosas or the whole
19:42 - crowd awesome wonderful thank you so
19:45 - much okay okay
19:49 - all right let's come over here now I'm
19:53 - gonna get I need just I think by the way
19:55 - I'm gonna need to do something about
19:56 - this camera but here we go okay so tell

20:11 - we're going to go live on facebook and
20:12 - people can join the stream and just by
20:14 - say like we're love they can control the
20:16 - machine i like we move to the left i
20:21 - love we move to the right and when the

20:54 - seven seven okay
20:56 - that plate is either going to be in one

21:21 - [Music]
21:24 - so I'm sort of feeling like this gimbal
21:28 - thing that I'm using is not doing much
21:30 - to stabilize the camera does anybody
21:32 - have any feedback as to if the camera
21:37 - seemed obviously my camera work and
21:38 - looking at the projects is terrible but
21:39 - as I walk around is it somewhat smooth
21:42 - or is it pretty jittery oh it seems
21:44 - stable okay so I'm not doing as badly as
21:46 - I think that I am okay great
21:50 - it looks great okay okay I'm gonna come
21:54 - up hello wait hold on I have poor
21:58 - connection so I'm gonna see if the Wi-Fi
22:00 - will kick in over here and then maybe we
22:03 - can look at your project a very bad
22:05 - connection pointing it down it might be
22:09 - I am pointing it down okay
22:14 - let me see if poor connection oh let me
22:16 - see sometimes if I back up

24:59 - this a try you are a little backlit from
25:01 - the window but that's okay we can see we
25:03 - can see you can you tell me your name
25:05 - and about your project um my name is
25:07 - Lindsay Daniels and my project is called
25:09 - route commute um I started recording a
25:13 - lot of videos of my train commute
25:15 - because my train is above ground so you
25:16 - get lots of nice videos of like the
25:18 - skyline um but then my way of putting it
25:21 - back underground was to project it
25:24 - underneath my plants and then kind of
25:26 - thinking about how what you do above
25:28 - ground affects what goes on underneath
25:30 - all of these plants have sensors in them
25:32 - so when you touch them you will slow
25:35 - down the commute or you can stop it
25:39 - entirely and the only way to bring it
25:42 - back is if you leave them alone and then
25:45 - it will eventually there we go turn all
25:48 - turn back on and then also they have
25:51 - there's a rain sensor in here so that
25:54 - when you water them all the videos
25:55 - actually switch over to times when it
25:57 - was raining on the tree so it's just an
26:00 - interesting way for me to look at the
26:01 - relationship between the two and play
26:03 - with how does one affect the other
26:05 - [Music]
26:06 - awesome and where where'd you get the
26:09 - plants where did I get in the plants
26:11 - well this one is my friends plant from
26:13 - her bathroom window the other three are
26:15 - mine and usually I buy my plants at the
26:17 - hardware store because that's where
26:19 - they're affordable yeah awesome
26:23 - it's we should have more plants at ITP
26:24 - and more plants and projects I we have
26:26 - so many plates wonderful great job thank
26:29 - you okay we're gonna keep going here
26:33 - what's that
26:35 - oh is it how behind is it okay we're
26:40 - going to walk around here apparently I'm
26:41 - actually this we're this is a caught in
26:45 - the plant so we have some sort of like
26:46 - recursion going on here here's the live
26:49 - stream right now so it's at some point
26:53 - there we go we'll have infinite windows
26:55 - etc etc okay thanks alright now we're
27:02 - going to go into the abyss here and see
27:06 - what other projects we can find here we
27:11 - go I've got poor connection hopefully
27:16 - hopefully it'll start took a very bad
27:19 - connection very bad connection I'm gonna
27:21 - I'm gonna say a prayer to the Wi-Fi gods
27:26 - eight oh one one one one one G BBB BBB
27:28 - way to 1 1 1 1 G bbbbb left home with
27:31 - 1gb BBB BBB this doesn't seem to be
27:33 - working
27:34 - is there another sort of thing I can try
27:36 - I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna walk around
27:38 - and hope that it comes back because I do
27:40 - want to look at this wonderful dragon
27:49 - all right let's see what we can find
27:51 - here still have very very bad connection
27:53 - I have to go somewhere where I get it
27:56 - hold on you up I'm trying to get the
28:01 - Wi-Fi to return that right now nobody
28:06 - can see anything because apparently we
28:08 - have a very bad connection
28:10 - well yeah it's good now I'm told it's
28:13 - good now let's come over here okay hold
28:15 - on hold on hold on I'm really bad at
28:17 - camerawork I'm learned and I'm trying
28:19 - okay now I'm gonna ask you some
28:21 - questions like what is your name and
28:23 - tell me about your project hi my name is
28:25 - Angela Peroni and my project is the
28:27 - Museum of funny ladies which is an
28:29 - interactive museum based on a piece of
28:31 - the history of women in comedy focusing
28:32 - on one of the Pioneer comedy writers
28:34 - from the 1970s so you get to take a peek
28:36 - into her world as one of the few women
28:38 - writing for comedy in the 70s so welcome
28:42 - to her office
28:47 - I was five and a half years to this job
28:50 - [Music]
28:53 - I call and I was going to do that the
28:56 - rest of my life it's fun to pursue
28:58 - she'll come
29:00 - people came into the office and we heard
29:04 - one
29:06 - you can hear anything my life
29:11 - [Music]
29:17 - you can see the different shows that she
29:19 - wrote so you're following the story arc
29:21 - of her career as a writer this
29:26 - television is amazing I grew up with the
29:28 - TV just like yes I I remember there was
29:31 - like a moment in time where we got a
29:33 - color TV and that was like a super
29:35 - exciting thing yeah Wow and here you are
29:38 - a couple years later we have so I have
29:40 - color TV on a gimbal lock with a
29:42 - microphone connected to the world I'm
29:45 - using my television phone it's very
29:47 - exciting and now did the Sybil did you
29:54 - talk to her about this project and she
29:56 - participated in then so she was actually
29:57 - here yesterday so Sybil is wonderful she
30:00 - responded to an email the beginning of
30:02 - my thesis process and was there the
30:04 - entire way all of these documents and
30:07 - images are from her all the interviews
30:08 - are from this project so they were only
30:13 - for the strategies for this project so
30:15 - she's been super wonderful and being
30:18 - part of this
30:20 - awesome thank you so much of course
30:23 - thank you yeah yeah this is great I
30:29 - don't have to be actually beat beyond
30:30 - anywhere up I have a good connection but
30:32 - I don't think the dragon is alive we're
30:35 - have to come back looks like there's
30:36 - some some the dragon is being fixed
30:39 - looks like there's some work happening
30:41 - we're gonna come over here to see what's
30:43 - happening here okay where are we gonna
30:48 - go next uh-oh
30:51 - [Music]
30:54 - oh here we go can we look at your
30:57 - project okay so a first I'm going to try
31:00 - to attempt to do some sort of interview
31:01 - of you which won't really be an
31:02 - interview hold on wait hold on I'm
31:05 - having camera work problems there we go
31:07 - okay now okay so tell me your name and
31:10 - tell me about your project okay hi I'm
31:12 - Matt Sarah my project is called cat in a
31:14 - box because there's many cats in this
31:16 - box and it's a it's a educational book
31:18 - box for kids to learn about simple
31:21 - circuits and I'll walk you through it
31:23 - yeah okay so pretend you're not seeing
31:26 - all this and it would feel like this and
31:29 - we would start off with a story of why
31:31 - we need to help cat because cats a party
31:34 - animal and breaks all the lights and so
31:36 - after that we go into like plug the
31:39 - lights and the buttons inside and we fix
31:43 - the circuits and you can live to see
31:45 - what you're actually doing and then we
31:48 - basically continue doing this for the
31:50 - rest of the house which somebody already
31:52 - did this back in and so yeah yeah oops
31:59 - if some lights that apparently cannot be
32:01 - fixed oh you're going so fast go back to
32:03 - this page oh yeah this is another socket
32:06 - with two lights and so it's this one and
32:10 - so here you can you can see what the
32:14 - difference in the circuits is like a
32:16 - little activity you can do inside and
32:19 - the last is is the room with the fan so
32:27 - then and then once you help cadfix all
32:30 - the lights there's a switch in here that
32:33 - basically turns on all the lights in the
32:35 - house wonderful now this is the format
32:38 - of this the structure it's inspired by a
32:40 - particular can you tell me about that
32:41 - yeah it's a it's a Indian form of art
32:44 - called Kivar it's from Rajasthan which
32:47 - which is why this is wrong and what it
32:51 - is it's like this pop-up it says Papa
32:53 - Meets museum sort of book storytelling
32:57 - method and it's beautiful so this whole
32:59 - the physical format of this is inspired
33:01 - by that and what kind of what kind of
33:04 - user testing did you do like along the
33:06 - way of building this ticket to the New
33:08 - York oh there was user testing with
33:09 - people on the floor at IDP but then
33:11 - there was also one at the New York Hall
33:13 - of Science which was so fabulous because
33:16 - kids are amazing and yeah that was great
33:20 - it was like three hours of testing and
33:22 - seeing what they liked and what they
33:23 - didn't and what what like did you is
33:26 - there kind of a targeted age range that
33:28 - you found it kind of works the best way
33:29 - there so I mean I've mostly tested with
33:33 - kids from four to ten and it works great
33:35 - and sort of like six to ten ish and
33:38 - there's also a way they use it the
33:40 - younger kids prefer just doing the top
33:41 - and like making the lights turn on and
33:44 - stuff but the older kids actually go in
33:47 - read and then try to mess around and see
33:49 - how they can make it different I just I
33:51 - really love the storytelling aspect of
33:53 - this and you know sort of a rich
33:55 - tradition of pop-up books and you know a
33:57 - lot of interactive stuff always ends up
33:58 - adding a screen and the fact that you're
34:00 - really still immersed in the story and
34:01 - in the content of the book is really
34:03 - wonderful
34:04 - yep name is creative and talented ah got
34:10 - it
34:11 - my cat is called cat okay got it thank
34:14 - you so much okay let's see where can we
34:16 - go
34:17 - you want to tell me about your project
34:19 - okay we're coming over here tell me your
34:22 - name hi my name is aldo montoya Moraga
34:25 - and this is my project is a set of tools
34:27 - for creating art so this in particular
34:28 - is a web scraper so you give it a
34:31 - concept for example I'm going to give it
34:32 - box and it's going to open google chrome
34:35 - and it's going to download as many
34:36 - pictures as it can from that concept and
34:39 - then on top of each one of them is going
34:41 - to put a message that expresses disgust
34:43 - against it just going to put something
34:45 - like this is bad this is this this this
34:48 - shouldn't be happening and things like
34:49 - that so while this is going on let me
34:51 - show you the other ones this is a
34:53 - processing solution and it's a countdown
34:56 - to my death so according to the United
34:58 - Nations that should be devon at 72 so
35:00 - this is a countdown that updates every
35:02 - day and when I read 72 years so it's
35:05 - gonna say I should be dead by now this
35:08 - one is a generator of random nonsensical
35:12 - jokes so you have the usuals like
35:14 - knock-knock jokes
35:15 - you have bar jobs on light bulb jokes
35:20 - and they're all Python libraries that
35:22 - you can install how many our teachers
35:24 - does it take to change a light bulb 577
35:27 - because of geodesic domes yeah I like to
35:30 - do and that's good because I've tried it
35:32 - I'm very bad at that
35:33 - I don't can't come up with good joke so
35:34 - this will be this will be very useful
35:35 - yeah this is a it's very cool for like
35:37 - being in tandem and just coming around
35:38 - with very short jokes that you can just
35:40 - fire them fire one after each other what
35:42 - what kind of text generation algorithm
35:44 - is is playing a role here and how though
35:46 - it's based so there's an algorithm that
35:49 - knows which are the structures of these
35:50 - Joe cycles and they have blanks on them
35:52 - leather feel by words that come from a
35:56 - repositories of tons of work
35:59 - awesome yeah thank you so much okay
36:03 - alright where are we going now alright
36:08 - yes okay all right we're coming over to
36:11 - this project here so tell me your name
36:14 - and tell me about your project hi my
36:16 - name is Anitha and my project is a
36:18 - wearable piece that detects and reacts
36:21 - verbal microaggressions so can you
36:24 - explain what a microaggression is so
36:26 - microaggressions are way that sometimes
36:27 - are expressed either in gesture or verbs
36:30 - that they might insult someone even
36:32 - though we didn't have the intention of
36:34 - that so as an example if you call a
36:36 - fully grown female as a girl that's a
36:38 - way of diminishing her or if you could
36:40 - say something like girl bear or don't be
36:42 - such a [ __ ] which are things that we
36:44 - end up saying they're just way of saying
36:46 - that being a female speaker when it
36:49 - actually not so the goal of this piece
36:52 - is just trying to make reflections over
36:55 - why we say the things that we say
36:57 - awesome so what happens with I say
36:59 - something [ __ ] okay and then if you say
37:06 - one of you yeah yeah I'm gonna react I
37:08 - will say the one on the bottom don't be
37:10 - bossy
37:20 - yeah Oh so have you actually worn this
37:24 - no not yet the documentation I did
37:27 - outside and people were just like what
37:29 - is happening and then there was some
37:31 - funny comments or just emails just like
37:33 - yeah we should have this and yeah so
37:35 - that's probably the next step it's great
37:37 - I mean I saw this yesterday so I knew
37:39 - what was gonna do but I just like the
37:41 - first reveal of it is so wonderful I
37:42 - love it thank you I think is amazing
37:46 - okay all right we're gonna keep moving
37:49 - on here and see what we can find
37:52 - how's it going
37:55 - [Music]
38:01 - all right what can I find
38:04 - looks like some fun is having had over
38:06 - here
38:07 - [Applause]
38:11 - can I ask you to explain what's going on
38:13 - here so first tell me your double your
38:16 - name middle I'm mitsue and my project
38:19 - here is the screaming Sun it's a noise
38:21 - making machine that is completely
38:23 - powered by light it also gets signal
38:25 - from light so what you see here is if I
38:28 - cover the solar panel there's nothing
38:30 - going on there's no power going into the
38:32 - system but the moment I give it light it
38:35 - kind of starts making some noise and you
38:38 - can you can so what she's doing right
38:40 - now is right now she's changing the
38:42 - color which changes the intensity of
38:44 - light and that also changes the
38:45 - frequency you can also change the
38:47 - intensity of light coming out of the
38:48 - phone and that also changes the
38:50 - intensity and it's fully analog so the
38:51 - phone isn't connected to it in any way I
38:53 - can take out the phone is still gonna
38:54 - work the same way and yeah so the light
39:00 - that we have here is connected this the
39:01 - light of course it can be any light
39:03 - source but I just brought in this really
39:05 - fancy light that changes colors and
39:07 - whatnot oh did you Matt where do you
39:09 - imagine this being used for a
39:10 - performance or more it's for interaction
39:12 - for users to play with it or what kind
39:13 - of where do you imagine this living or
39:15 - habitat play I mean I started this as an
39:18 - experiment but right but right now it
39:20 - kind of feels like it can be used for
39:23 - some sort of musical expression I guess
39:25 - so so yeah it's it's just it started off
39:29 - as an experiment but now we're all just
39:30 - having fun collaboratively having fun so
39:32 - yeah thanks
39:37 - okay can I ask you about your project
39:41 - okay so first tell me your name and
39:44 - about your project so my name is Jesse
39:46 - Horowitz and my project is the radius
39:48 - project and essentially what it is is a
39:51 - device that attempts to count the number
39:53 - of people in an area by detecting smart
39:55 - phones so what I use that for was to
39:58 - create this map you'll see here and the
40:01 - blue is data that I collected and the
40:03 - black and white is US census data and
40:06 - the reason I wanted to do this was I
40:08 - spent a lot of time working with US
40:09 - census data as a geography major in
40:11 - college and one issue is that you'll
40:13 - notice is that it's residentially
40:15 - focused so neighborhoods like Midtown
40:17 - will be considered empty when
40:19 - experientially we know that Midtown is a
40:22 - very dense neighborhood so I was
40:24 - interested in building this device to
40:25 - sort of get it what is the experience of
40:27 - population density where do we find that
40:30 - and how does that change over time in
40:31 - place so this is something that you
40:34 - could
40:35 - we're with you yeah ideally I've tried
40:39 - to design it so that it could fit in a
40:40 - pocket and be pretty portable so that it
40:43 - could be used over like a large study
40:45 - area basically so right now it's telling
40:51 - us that nearby there are what's the
40:54 - units like is that actually 13 people or
40:56 - is it so it would say certain generally
41:00 - there's about 63 people nearby but then
41:03 - it kind of breaks that down into even
41:05 - more specific categories so that the
41:06 - nearby units in the middle there would
41:08 - probably be more like in this room and
41:10 - sort of line of sight and then that
41:12 - faraway category is is anyone who's in
41:14 - like sort of Wi-Fi connection distance
41:17 - which is about like 110 to 100 meters
41:19 - awesome cool thank you a great job
41:21 - whoops oh did I just turn my gimbal
41:23 - thing off hold on it has all these
41:25 - different settings and I really haven't
41:27 - figured out the magical one yet okay
41:29 - well let's let's see if we can go inside
41:31 - this house all right cannot Danielle can
41:37 - I come ask you about your project okay
41:39 - so first you tell me your name and tell
41:41 - me about your project and I'll go inside
41:43 - yeah okay hi I'm Danielle Butler and I
41:46 - made safehouse which is an immersive
41:48 - physical environment and part of it is
41:51 - that you're meant to be surprised by
41:52 - what you find inside and so when you
41:55 - duck in then you can interact with what
41:59 - you find inside and discover more about
42:02 - the space in the story how many people
42:05 - would you say came and went inside
42:06 - yesterday that's a really good question
42:09 - a lot and what I loved is how many
42:11 - people would go in at one time so what's
42:13 - what's the most that's been in there
42:14 - once them I think five and it was great
42:17 - because I built it as an immersive
42:18 - installation for one and so it's really
42:21 - fun to see five pairs of legs sticking
42:24 - out the bottom okay I'm gonna try
42:25 - something very strange which is to go
42:27 - inside with this ridiculous camera thing
42:31 - and microphone okay okay I'm here I go
42:33 - we're going down now we're going up and
42:37 - inside the house okay so I'm gonna kind
42:40 - of spin around here whoops you can see
42:44 - now there are all these little doors and
42:47 - things that I could open up
42:57 - [Music]
42:58 - let's try this one
43:15 - [Music]
43:24 - [Music]
43:31 - okay I just have to try every single one
43:33 - because it's too much fun
43:36 - [Music]
43:39 - this is like a drawer uh oh okay it's
43:41 - fair to do this is the maker phone I'll
43:43 - skip that what so you can see there's
43:45 - all these beautiful like little like
43:47 - tree-like structures it looks like they
43:48 - were like maybe laser-cut little discs
43:51 - and attached together
43:53 - the trees are amazing but you guys I
43:54 - don't know if you can really see this
43:56 - but the ceiling is also quite beautiful
43:58 - I can actually so this is what's above
44:01 - [Music]
44:04 - actually I don't have the FET to it okay
44:09 - Oh what's this there's one more here
44:12 - there's like a little peak like a little
44:14 - people let's see if I and there's like a
44:15 - little tiny light in there look at this
44:17 - it's kind of amazing okay all right I'm
44:21 - going to now exit we're gonna take a
44:23 - look at these trees one last time too
44:26 - much nose sorry about that okay here we
44:29 - go I'm coming neck out now
44:33 - oh yeah thank you I've got it thank you
44:37 - so much this I love it
44:40 - it's amazing I just I love the moments
44:42 - of surprise and being able to look
44:43 - inside and find these little like these
44:46 - little tiny scenes the miniature like
44:49 - and the trees are beautiful two people
44:50 - were commenting that people who love the
44:51 - truth great job I definitely feel like
44:53 - sort of warmth and safety 'no sand
44:56 - comfort being in there so I think
44:57 - successful in that regards for sure okay
45:03 - all right hello hi se ho can you tell me
45:05 - about tell me your name and tell me
45:07 - about your project
45:08 - hi I'm Sarah and this is an artificial
45:11 - anti dancer
45:12 - so they're guys it's a stick figure that
45:15 - is like dancing by itself but it also
45:18 - gets like inspiration from people that
45:21 - is something in front of it so it's like
45:24 - improvising with them and also like
45:28 - learning about the new bottle what
45:30 - people are doing and then like doing
45:32 - that afterwards so it's like well it can
45:36 - generate like some kind of dialogue in
45:38 - which the stick figure follows you but
45:40 - you also follow weeds and that like this
45:43 - improvisation
45:44 - yeah I try it you want to hold this for
45:47 - me
45:49 - a little bit of a mess here the old if
45:51 - you hold that the microphone prod
45:53 - doesn't really matter
45:59 - now you will know that it's always a
46:02 - 13-year
46:08 - [Music]
46:24 - [Music]
46:34 - I think I have to stop
46:38 - how did I do okay thank you awesome okay
46:47 - let's see here can I come can I come
46:50 - squeeze the blob okay
46:56 - all right let's see here so first can
47:01 - you I know this was a collaboration
47:02 - between you two right you want to come
47:04 - stand next to each other to have like
47:06 - your your okay so hold on I'm trying to
47:09 - let's see okay so tell me your names and
47:11 - tell me about the project hi my name is
47:13 - Regina
47:14 - my name is mint and this was a
47:18 - collaboration for two classes it's
47:20 - tangible interactions in live image
47:22 - processing and well you need to squish
47:26 - it yes you know what I get it I get it
47:28 - okay you hold them okay so I've got the
47:35 - blob here's the blob and now what I'm
47:38 - going to do is squeeze the block
47:44 - [Music]
47:46 - it's kind of like one of those uh
47:49 - stress-buster things it's very satisfied
47:53 - it's harder to squeeze than you would
47:55 - think very satisfying what's on this
48:06 - screen over here oh that's some of the
48:09 - 3d scanning you're doing
48:14 - you're missing
48:18 - okay hold on people are asking for to
48:20 - see what I'm talking about somebody go
48:22 - over here this is you can see okay so
48:26 - tell me about the 3d scanning problem so
48:33 - basically the way it works is you have
48:35 - that thing I'm holding it's an iPad with
48:37 - a structure sensor and so main had to
48:41 - sit to stand like super steel and I just
48:45 - go all around her take around I think it
48:48 - was like seventy three shots and then an
48:51 - app just makes a model out of her and
48:54 - then she went and took the models and
48:57 - did those animations of us we're not
49:01 - doing we cannot do that in real life
49:06 - it's awesome when do I get my three skin
49:09 - whatever okay awesome great job you guys
49:14 - I loved I just love the interface it's
49:16 - really so satisfying it it's awesome
49:19 - great okay uh-huh
49:23 - let's listen okay this is supposed to be
49:26 - a thing to stabilize the camera but I
49:28 - think it might might be causing more
49:29 - trouble than it's worth but okay so let
49:32 - me hold on let me first try to get you
49:34 - in this shot here I'm gonna ask you to
49:35 - state your name and your purpose now
49:37 - just a say your name and tell me about
49:39 - your project I'm Erin not Erin although
49:42 - I live here that run really you guys are
49:44 - roommates yeah yeah yeah we live in a
49:46 - giant makerspace um so this is my
49:50 - project it's called thank you lights
49:52 - basically it's made out of I tried to
49:55 - use materials from the trash so a lot of
49:57 - the bags say thank you in New York so I
49:59 - called it thank you lights it's powered
50:01 - off of aluminum um takeout tins and
50:06 - charcoal from a campfire and salt water
50:11 - so basically the way we it the only
50:15 - thing that's powering the light is for
50:17 - these realities yeah we move tunes like
50:20 - takeout mm-hmm charcoal where did you
50:22 - get that from this I just burned some
50:24 - stuff in my my grill okay and that's a
50:27 - subscribe moon and the other is
50:28 - literally just water and salt yep
50:30 - yeah we're like you can use anything
50:32 - Gatorade you could use urine you can
50:36 - anything so yeah this is one of the
50:40 - batteries and basically there's a few
50:43 - cells in here that are sandwiches are
50:44 - those ingredients and then I'm using
50:45 - plastic bags to insulate them from each
50:48 - other and then there's a high powered
50:50 - LED that it's powering
50:52 - you can it'll last about ten hours with
50:55 - this light and then I'm using just a
50:57 - phone charger to recharge it to recharge
51:00 - your charcoal saltwater battery yeah so
51:03 - every 10 minutes or sorry every 10 hours
51:06 - if you plug in over 10 minutes it'll
51:07 - recharge it and are there any like I
51:10 - mean obviously this is sort of just a
51:13 - research and experiment to try this idea
51:15 - but if this if you're actually to use
51:16 - these is there any like safety concern
51:18 - or like what would I guess if you filled
51:20 - a room with a million of them they'd
51:21 - start emitting a hydrogen gas but if you
51:24 - need a lot of them to know they're
51:27 - pretty safe I mean they're not like
51:28 - lithium batteries that uh you know
51:30 - lithium reacts to oxygen very violently
51:33 - if you youtube hoverboard a battery
51:35 - explosion the yeah them using just
51:39 - regular plastic bags that i've learned
51:41 - together with the clothing Kanodia so
51:45 - that's kind of a fun process but one
51:47 - other cool thing about these bags are
51:49 - made out of high density polyethylene so
51:51 - you can actually they're safe to laser
51:52 - cut so I've been laser cutting them
51:54 - instead of buying they fuse together
51:57 - when you layer them on top and I I just
51:59 - have three this is three bags so it kind
52:02 - of makes a stronger material and then
52:04 - you can you can send them through the
52:05 - laser cutter without any fumes or
52:08 - anything as long as you use HDPE bags
52:13 - see if I can find that
52:15 - most most plastic bags are executed so
52:19 - awesome cool thank you so much great
52:21 - thank you
52:22 - okay well that's amazing all right so
52:24 - here we go I'm gonna keep walking around
52:26 - and try to get this camera stable whoa
52:29 - yeah somebody just posted something
52:32 - crazy in the chat okay okay here we go
52:37 - let's see I'm gonna go this way we're
52:41 - gonna go we're going to attempt to enter
52:44 - we're going to enter this darkroom I'm
52:46 - not sure what's going to happen when we
52:47 - go in here hello hello can we sit temp
52:54 - to see if we can make this project work
52:55 - here and then to try okay foot hold on
52:58 - let's see do you guys want to come stand
52:59 - over here where you might be in some
53:00 - light oh you don't have to turn the
53:07 - light on it's pretty it's no you're fine
53:13 - you're absolutely fine okay here so
53:16 - first one can you guys tell me your name
53:17 - and tell me about your project and then
53:19 - hold on I this thing is supposed to
53:21 - stabilize the camera and I'm not doing a
53:23 - good job and then we'll then we'll try
53:24 - it out okay so hold on here we go ready
53:26 - and hello I'm Haley hi I'm yes oh and
53:30 - our project is mirage' slide experiments
53:35 - and it's an interactive lighting
53:36 - installation using EMS stage lighting
53:39 - and people can interact with the light
53:42 - and
53:44 - there's no projection or screen involved
53:47 - to this it's just theater stage light
53:49 - that's true yeah we are using the three
53:51 - spot lights and the one say spotlights
53:55 - and but one is like moving hands so like
53:57 - you can track the people so even move
53:59 - the like people's like the motion and
54:03 - location what how are you track how is
54:06 - interactive how are you tracking what
54:08 - the person does to track people's
54:12 - gallatin and we process data from
54:14 - processing and so we control the DMX
54:18 - light color and the location and the
54:22 - size and we are using DMX light because
54:25 - now instead of slide like presentation
54:28 - like projectors because we try with
54:31 - projectors but they give away right
54:33 - faith and not very clear image like
54:35 - compared to DMX and we really like the
54:37 - quality of the light very crisp and
54:39 - light bright awesome cool okay so I'm
54:42 - going to okay let's do it let's look at
54:44 - first let's see so I'm going to see if I
54:46 - can get some shots here so this is the
54:47 - stage lighting whoa
54:50 - and we can see the setup here you can
54:53 - see that there is a connect up top here
54:56 - and then this is this particular kind of
55:00 - light does this kind of light have a
55:01 - special name or anything this is a
55:04 - moving had a light but the brand names
55:07 - elations
55:08 - if we just call the Elysian light got it
55:13 - okay um you guys want to hold this and
55:15 - I'll try it
55:16 - are you want demonstrate it okay why
55:19 - don't you demonstrate home let me come
55:20 - back over here just give me a second
55:22 - okay hold on let's let me try to get
55:24 - them okay go ahead
55:43 - you
55:51 - that's my favorite part so let's look at
55:56 - the tracking here
55:57 - oh so you actually also have a little
56:02 - simulation of where you think or where
56:05 - the light is supposed to be and as well
56:07 - as what's actually doing that's great
56:08 - and are you you guys are using which I'm
56:12 - using processing yeah and then are you
56:14 - and are using the the Windows SDK the
56:18 - processing library for Windows with the
56:19 - Kinect that's great
56:20 - we are some USB to up there called qlx
56:24 - to control the DMX like brightness and
56:27 - location and 500 people are asking about
56:32 - the delay I don't know if they're asking
56:33 - about the livestream or a delay but I
56:35 - don't think there really is it looks
56:36 - very real time to me I don't see any lag
56:38 - at all using a DMX signal and same SS
56:44 - software but we that's why we are using
56:46 - the CMS you to really stable and it's
56:49 - high faster than other like
56:51 - communication way so you're really like
56:54 - happy to use this and you imagine this
56:58 - baby being used in a performance or yeah
57:01 - so actually we we just went to the
57:04 - density apartment like show last week
57:06 - and then maybe because collaborate with
57:08 - the tensor performance it's really nice
57:11 - and it actually we can add more effect
57:13 - like for the like show
57:16 - cause up you can imagine in a really
57:19 - huge space way you could do is you're
57:20 - limited because just have a small area
57:22 - to demonstrate it lightest can move like
57:25 - uber 360-degree like actually is not the
57:28 - like one more it's actually you can use
57:30 - a whole space of the war and don't like
57:33 - selling and they like flowers so it's
57:36 - really a we want to like working more
57:41 - like public space like building faster
57:44 - than like outdoor space and light like
57:47 - freedom for in the Washington Square
57:49 - Park yeah awesome great job you guys
57:52 - sure
57:57 - can I ask you about your wind chimes
57:59 - okay so hold on let me try to come over
58:01 - here first and see here okay so tell me
58:05 - your name and you tell me about the
58:06 - project and then I'll put the camera on
58:08 - the project hi I'm Roxanne King and my
58:12 - project name is wind chime so basically
58:14 - this is some real-time light fixture and
58:17 - also this is my person doesn't have
58:21 - sounds but it's like visualised wind
58:24 - chime visualised wind so basically I
58:27 - have three times and each every cylinder
58:31 - has different different modules that can
58:35 - connect to Wi-Fi and then they
58:38 - representative of each cities so one is
58:41 - the soul and what what is the New York
58:43 - and the last one is actually the fake
58:46 - data because I want to contrast like
58:48 - desert and very dry and windy city so
58:51 - right now they are I'm using my hotspot
58:54 - right now so I grabbed a weather API
58:58 - from the open wthr.com so they're called
59:02 - and I visualize their temperatures and
59:05 - also the wind speed changes how they
59:09 - will help us there
59:26 - great modern interpretation of the idea
59:28 - of an old wind chime it's great
59:30 - well it's really like nice how they the
59:33 - light sort of fills from the top to
59:36 - bottom the last will be like star
59:39 - deserts or something like very windy and
59:41 - dry and hot City awesome great thank you
59:49 - can I ask you about this I can I sit
59:52 - down
59:53 - this is rope okay so first let's let's
59:59 - have a look here oh my goodness okay so
60:02 - um can you tell me your name and then
60:04 - about the project uh I'm smelly and this
60:07 - is my porous calcium oberfield
60:09 - I was inspired by this Chinese saying of
60:12 - oxygen into the field and few change
60:14 - back to the sea which which means that
60:15 - the great changes in the nature that we
60:18 - as human being our we don't live long
60:20 - enough to see that happening in real
60:21 - life so I want to create this like
60:23 - fictional window you can sit around and
60:26 - have a cup of tea and you can see that
60:29 - um inside a window that is happening
60:31 - what takes a millions of year like in
60:33 - real life so right now it's a
60:38 - here is where we as human would build
60:41 - things and then later on the water is
60:46 - coming over which is the second layers
60:48 - of rotation coming over to wash away our
60:52 - machine systems and they go back to the
60:54 - mountains like a whole loop that keeps
60:56 - happening around like 15 minutes it's a
60:59 - full cycle of that it is I just love the
61:07 - analog quality of it so what's what's
61:11 - actually behind there
61:12 - Polly wanna see sure I want to look at
61:14 - this beautiful setup that you have here
61:16 - so what are the different elements here
61:17 - you have just explanatory stuff about
61:19 - the project uh yeah this is where I got
61:23 - the inspiration from a couple and it was
61:26 - inspired by this time lapse video I made
61:28 - for light interactivity I just see that
61:30 - like human existence in the way there is
61:32 - like we're flickering around and I see
61:34 - the Sun is keep rising far as a law it
61:36 - just makes me think that something that
61:38 - in nature is very like like whatever but
61:41 - we as human with don't live blowing now
61:43 - so I was inspired by this idea then I
61:45 - kind of have this a whole graphic design
61:47 - of it and yeah is there a particular
61:50 - significance to the peach or uh not
61:53 - really I'm gonna eat it either pretty on
61:58 - the table I agree completely I was just
62:01 - wondering if what what the cultural
62:02 - significance is that I don't know about
62:04 - no no agent nation yes I agree
62:06 - okay is it organic all right let's look
62:10 - bond okay so let's come back and see
62:15 - what's back here
62:18 - extra is three layers of paper cousin is
62:21 - attached with a circle and how they are
62:25 - and yeah so that's basically de and
62:30 - Audrina and breadboard in a nice hat
62:39 - thank you so much
62:42 - it's very hard to quote create like
62:44 - quiet contemplative projects at the ITV
62:47 - show but you've done a really nice job
62:48 - of that okay
62:58 - okay
63:00 - [Music]
63:04 - we've got another project here with some
63:06 - bubbles projected I think we're waiting
63:13 - for the Kinect to come alive go back
63:17 - okay
63:18 - I'm gonna slip by you man
63:26 - will you tell me about your project Eric
63:28 - okay they hold on hold I'm not ready yet
63:31 - so first tell me your name in lwith so
63:34 - I'm Eric when she leave I'm doing a
63:36 - project about like a collar and pop-up
63:39 - windows so there are 190 pop-up windows
63:43 - which were assembling the collar from
63:45 - the cat webcam and also it's running a
63:47 - very basic level of machine learning so
63:50 - like this I have some business card mine
63:52 - has different color if I put on the in
63:55 - front of the webcam we will start
63:58 - assembling the color because it's
64:02 - running algorithm so it's only something
64:05 - the color have the most frequently in
64:07 - front of the camera
64:10 - now I change it to another one all of
64:14 - these are separate browser windows yes
64:17 - because I think like the pop-up windows
64:20 - it's like the trash on the Internet
64:23 - people close it once it immediately
64:25 - pop-up so I think I should do some
64:28 - recycling stuff you know using those
64:30 - pop-up windows to you know draw picture
64:32 - play some song make some instruments
64:34 - just like what do we do with those
64:36 - physical trash awesome it's beautiful
64:39 - it's it's kind of it's you know you we
64:41 - could I would see the same sort of grid
64:43 - and what it just has a different quality
64:45 - sort of seeing it on the desktop with
64:46 - all these kind of crazy windows there's
64:48 - this like using a very simple layout but
64:52 - like you know give you a pixel style
64:54 - pictures there
64:56 - as what the camera is actually seeing as
64:59 - well as the sort of pixelated version of
65:01 - it and how does how are you - how does
65:04 - this how do you communicate from the
65:08 - camera to so many different windows
65:10 - actually I have once grapes to raise a
65:13 - collar and try to assembly them and then
65:16 - use a socket to send the collar to each
65:19 - of the windows so in theory this could
65:21 - work each across network so you could
65:24 - have hundreds of computers all over the
65:26 - world each sort of showing the same
65:27 - thing yes actually is playing some music
65:30 - right now and you can play with the
65:32 - windows like change the location of
65:33 - different windows or resize the window
65:36 - and it will change the loads its
65:37 - generative music so like each time you
65:40 - know click it or resize a you will get
65:43 - have like different result it's awesome
65:46 - great job ok
65:49 - you want to tell me can you talk about
65:51 - your projects hey hold on I'm having
65:54 - some issues here with my camera
65:56 - stabilizer ok so tell me your name and
65:58 - about your project so Steven Simon and I
66:00 - made a children's interactive storybook
66:02 - with physics involved from the classes
66:05 - nature of code so oh what a coincidence
66:08 - so I don't know actually requires
66:11 - probably headphones in it so so yeah
66:12 - this is on the web people could look at
66:14 - it right now if they go to the URL right
66:15 - yeah so this is live so anyone can go to
66:18 - this yeah and what's the story about so
66:21 - it's about a bear that learns how to
66:22 - cook and it kind of teaches children how
66:24 - to cook awesome great job cool
66:29 - so that's Steven Simon - portfolio comm
66:32 - /ko di HTML I'm sure somebody will post
66:35 - it up look it's already posted yeah I've
66:39 - got a very good chatroom here going oh
66:41 - yeah oh wow look at that yeah that's
66:45 - wonderful
66:46 - also making pop-up books Oh
66:49 - that's great it's kind of like a
66:51 - audit bonus awesome great job
66:57 - to go this way
67:05 - come back
67:08 - hello I've got a live stream going here
67:12 - if you can believe this so I have to
67:14 - come back and have a more proper
67:15 - conversation I've like point eviction
67:17 - ever awake you're going to be on more
67:21 - projects would be done soon nice to see
67:22 - you okay okay say hello again walking
67:27 - around ah let's oh the dragon is on okay
67:31 - we're gonna come see the dragon now
67:35 - okay
67:49 - can I ask you to tell me about the
67:51 - project okay so tell me your name first
67:53 - and tell me about the my name is
67:55 - Franklin and this is my thesis project
67:56 - colored ritual the last forever and it's
68:00 - a kinetic sculpture of the traditional
68:03 - dragon dance performance yeah so so long
68:07 - it's long story short so just trying to
68:12 - bring back something that is deep
68:16 - transmitted into my culture DNA in a
68:19 - modern form so that yeah it can be
68:24 - remember again absolutely beautiful
68:26 - stunning GM do you have if you were to
68:29 - make this again a second version of this
68:31 - because what would you what would you do
68:33 - differently oh definitely I'm going to
68:35 - shorter that arm and have better motors
68:40 - I would like to have been made with
68:42 - custom parts so that I don't have I
68:45 - don't need those hoes
68:48 - are not necessary
68:49 - and what scale do you think you could
68:51 - actually make this that cuz it'll be
68:53 - amazing if we're above you definitely
68:54 - yeah it will be great if it got fill the
68:57 - entire room you know awesome it's really
69:00 - stunning great job okay I'm gonna try to
69:02 - try to show people it a little bit more
69:07 - so this is it from the front
69:09 - I'm going to come around to look at it
69:11 - from the side
69:35 - okay let's go and look at these
69:37 - sculptures here that are really quite
69:39 - lovely
69:45 - I don't see Shir the designer of these
69:47 - sculptures what I'm going to show them
69:48 - to you anyway these are called light
69:51 - escapes
70:05 - these are 3d press or have a little
70:08 - tired of doing this for an hour in ten
70:09 - minutes these are 3d printed sculptures
70:12 - that have light inside of them
70:17 - I don't see the creator of this project
70:19 - here this one is my favorite because it
70:23 - kind of it has the sort of entrance into
70:25 - the abyss here by the way you guys able
70:28 - to hear people that I'm interviewing and
70:30 - hear me okay because it's so loud in
70:32 - here but I guess the shotgun mic works
70:33 - pretty well okay
70:38 - where else can we go let's go to let's
70:45 - go towards the back we almost hit every
70:49 - single room so now I'm walking towards
70:56 - the back here
70:57 - Oh excellent we've got some crazy
70:59 - balloons here
71:04 - [Applause]
71:10 - [Music]
71:12 - [Applause]
71:15 - [Music]
71:24 - [Applause]
71:33 - here in
71:39 - [Music]
71:57 - so I'm enjoying your guys lovely chat
72:00 - here
72:00 - you li can ask you about this project
72:02 - all right so tell me your name and tell
72:04 - me about this project my name is Sunita
72:07 - so this is the wave washed sand which I
72:11 - made out of like an Asian Chinese poem
72:14 - well can you tell me a little more about
72:17 - the poem who's it by and where you found
72:19 - it
72:20 - so this bowl resonated with me a lot
72:23 - because it's like kind of express those
72:25 - excel feeling Coppola was in prison and
72:28 - they he was in the Exile when he wrote
72:31 - his porn that's why the center balloon
72:33 - is kind of like in cage and then so me
72:36 - as a traveling students kind of feel
72:38 - resonating with him so on a base my
72:40 - thesis project on it so from there I
72:44 - kind of like try to find who is the best
72:46 - performer to perform this cone and then
72:50 - I decide to use balloons and then after
72:52 - that I kind of like put all this
72:54 - mechanism together to choreograph this
72:57 - performance or this show going through
72:58 - different lines and then with balloons
73:00 - movements to express the feelings so the
73:03 - poem is down here and it end you like
73:06 - laser-etched it into this surface yeah
73:09 - laser etched and laser carded
73:14 - there are like English translation
73:16 - and so for each line of the poem there's
73:20 - a different choreography of the balloons
73:22 - yeah it's like an act of the show to the
73:28 - balloon at the balloons ever pop they
73:30 - never pop day like this is the last
73:32 - flying of this through and then they
73:35 - almost pop that but a string bag is kind
73:37 - of like paying the current life it's
73:42 - really fantastic kind of though a great
73:46 - job when I come back here so this is the
73:47 - mechanism behind it so you can see I
73:50 - guess air is going through these tubes
73:52 - it's so loud I don't know if you guys
73:54 - can hear how loud
74:10 - hello can I interview you about your
74:13 - projects okay so tell me your name and
74:15 - about your project so my name is drone
74:16 - right my project is called Iommi and
74:19 - it's based on a character I made like my
74:21 - 2d animation days so what I did is I
74:24 - made a crow a clear dart and did some
74:26 - edge lighting with the LED strip so
74:29 - there it is
74:39 - it's supposed to make it more stable but
74:40 - it's causing the issues so you've
74:42 - mentioned that you that this is a
74:44 - character from your TV animation day so
74:46 - you have a background working in
74:47 - television so I go through the animation
74:48 - reading yeah so actually a basis I based
74:51 - this illustration for one of my digital
74:52 - paintings so I want this for my it was
74:56 - pieces together I made of magic for so
74:58 - wanted to see if I can translate the
75:00 - painting into acrylic physical form so
75:04 - there are the similarities between your
75:06 - layered like peeking in layers and but
75:08 - also like I guess stacking acrylic in
75:11 - layers so there were some similarities
75:12 - there but just the physical medium is
75:15 - not less forgiving so I didn't make a
75:17 - lot of mistakes and have to go through a
75:19 - lot of acrylic unfortunately more
75:20 - expensive but uh
75:22 - I think if the end results came out
75:24 - pretty well I'm kind of happy with it
75:25 - and I think I probably try to pursue
75:27 - this and going forward see our new
75:29 - rhythm it's amazing it it's amazing how
75:32 - much it comes to light life blend it
75:34 - lights up because I was here earlier
75:36 - when it was off in your time looking
75:37 - what is there not only a juicer you know
75:39 - balloons and it's amazing yeah a little
75:43 - really different from upcycle plastic
75:46 - but yeah definitely also providing a
75:48 - child thank you okay
75:54 - [Music]
76:01 - can I get you to tell me about the
76:03 - umbrella okay hold on hold on hold on
76:07 - wait let's just have this is supposed to
76:14 - make my life easier shaky cam okay
76:17 - I think I got it back under control okay
76:18 - so tell me your name and about the
76:20 - problem all right
76:20 - hi I'm Samantha and my project is
76:23 - waiting in the rain or the umbrella rain
76:25 - machine and basically it is supposed to
76:28 - be an outdoor lamp or an umbrella that
76:30 - you take with you and what it's not
76:31 - raining it simulates the rain so I have
76:34 - sound and light going above and then I
76:36 - have actual water sensors on the top and
76:39 - so they change brightness according to
76:41 - how one there so it actually is reading
76:44 - will have these lights above come on
76:46 - and they'll flicker in the rain so you
76:49 - have
76:53 - it's really just nice to be
76:56 - enjoyable
76:58 - the gloomy rain a little bit more
77:00 - exciting
77:01 - I love this pound yes let's do this
77:05 - through your left could you do imagine
77:07 - that's actually being used out in the
77:09 - rain I think that it could be used in
77:11 - the rain I need to make sure how durable
77:14 - and waterproof it is but another idea it
77:17 - could possibly be just like a canopy or
77:19 - a tent and you just have it installed
77:21 - and you know Paul sleep underneath it I
77:23 - guess Google love falling asleep the
77:25 - rain noises so that was another idea but
77:28 - yeah what what class did you do this
77:30 - book on mostly light and interactivity I
77:32 - did a little homemade hardware make my
77:35 - own rain sensors but yeah an
77:37 - installation was for life awesome great
77:39 - job okay
77:47 - let's see hold on I gotta see if I can
77:49 - get this I've lost my here we go okay no
77:53 - no I just think this thing went a little
77:55 - bit crazy okay can I ask can you tell me
77:59 - about this project so tell me first hola
78:02 - okay hold on let me what I'm gonna do it
78:04 - actually is I'm mature what if I turn
78:06 - off the gimbal thing I'm just do that
78:08 - for a second the cameras going to go a
78:10 - little bit nuts
78:12 - okay now I'm going to turn it back on
78:17 - okay ah there we go I'm back okay so
78:20 - tell me your name and tell me about this
78:21 - project
78:22 - hi my name is Carly so this project I
78:26 - called it orbits training
78:31 - creating a big shadow so you stand in
78:34 - front of it you see your shadow always
78:37 - moving and running and it's actually
78:40 - inspired by outer space so yeah no space
78:43 - when a star is flying around another
78:45 - star when you get closer to that star
78:48 - they need to speed up and will be
78:52 - further you need to slow down so that it
78:54 - won't fly away and I feel like it's just
78:56 - like all the human beings that we all
78:58 - have the gravity that we never noticed
79:01 - and we are attracted by each other and
79:05 - we change our speed to to keep our orbit
79:09 - from each other people so that's the
79:11 - idea like you just become something like
79:13 - a tourist and you gotta move there
79:16 - you see a change of speed because of you
79:20 - existing there
79:22 - awesome so if I stand here if I turn
79:25 - around stand here I'm seeing oh my
79:28 - goodness
79:29 - [Music]
79:36 - well can you demonstrate it for me
79:46 - [Music]
80:07 - well I I love how much it really feels
80:10 - like a shadow and I know you're using a
80:13 - projector I can see it down there but
80:15 - it's just like I do have this light back
80:18 - here that gives you and it's so you the
80:20 - way that you've set up this installation
80:22 - with the light and the connecting the
80:23 - projector it just feels so much like an
80:25 - actual shadow it's really amazing
80:26 - yeah thanks a lot of people think they
80:30 - saw something like a Peter Pan you know
80:33 - right right
80:34 - it's very magic thing yeah great job
80:43 - all right let's see here
80:47 - [Music]
80:49 - hello
80:52 - guys what can you guys tell me about the
80:54 - project
80:55 - yeah okay some of your name first my
80:57 - name is Gina oh hi hi I'm Manning bear
81:02 - beauty they are Ruby skating experience
81:06 - based on the story of illegal mental
81:10 - hospital the audience as a patient they
81:13 - need to escape the room with both the
81:16 - physical clothes and the clothes they
81:18 - fund through the
81:19 - through the board
81:28 - so this is like an escape the room
81:30 - experience
81:36 - all the images our target image is going
81:39 - to trigger animations and
81:42 - videos clues to help you unlock the
81:46 - planter box
81:49 - [Music]
81:53 - and how do you know when you've
81:55 - completed it we are going to put a
81:59 - wristband on each players raised so
82:02 - because we are limited by the space we
82:06 - can't create a door so the goal is to
82:10 - find the right tools to how the
82:11 - wristband that you are free yeah yeah
82:14 - wonderful it's such a beautiful little
82:17 - like sanctuary you've created an invest
82:19 - of all this chaos I love the idea of
82:21 - Yusuf combining VR with clues to escape
82:24 - and so is our one of these actually like
82:27 - a lock that you have to open right there
82:29 - are three locks one is using a key one
82:34 - is using a four-digit four-digit
82:37 - combination numbers and the last one is
82:40 - going to use a word to unlock
82:43 - awesome boy have people been successful
82:47 - or they've had a lot of trouble has
82:51 - anybody gotten it no actually because we
82:54 - only give each person five minutes to do
82:57 - this second we got a very tired of
83:03 - eating bees yesterday so everybody only
83:07 - got five minutes
83:09 - maybe somebody will get it today all
83:12 - right thanks okay
83:14 - I'm gonna I'm gonna go out this way
83:28 - all right everybody whoops oh my
83:30 - goodness
83:31 - [Music]
83:33 - by the way in case you're wondering this
83:36 - is the room where all the furniture of
83:37 - ITP is and I got to reset this gimbal
83:41 - lock thing up look now it's pointing at
83:42 - me hello
83:46 - turned around backwards okay let me
83:48 - reset it how do I do that I'm going to
83:51 - turn it off
83:56 - I'm gonna turn it back on
84:00 - [Music]
84:06 - now I'm going to do this okay so I think
84:10 - I might be wrapping up soon I think I've
84:12 - got most all the project nice definitely
84:15 - haven't gotten all the projects but I've
84:17 - gotten a bunch let's come look at this
84:18 - over here but oh we've got a poor
84:22 - connection can I can I ask you about
84:25 - your project okay hold on let's see I'm
84:27 - having trouble with this camera let me
84:29 - try to get it to stabilize okay okay so
84:34 - tell me your name and tell me about your
84:36 - project
84:36 - oh my name Xia and my project then thank
84:41 - you
84:43 - each box have a live stream camera layer
84:45 - and I added some difference for the
84:48 - first one I turning it's a little bit
84:52 - labs so when they're seen falling down
84:54 - you can feel like a tiny person is the
84:56 - flying and the second one like zooming
84:59 - and make people feel like but by
85:02 - actually said nitch let's stir why so
85:05 - like a brand to live stream radio
85:07 - together I hope to make people thinking
85:10 - about that well we love from the public
85:14 - media maybe not that shoes I mean people
85:17 - can choose to a certain wheel to
85:19 - shooting at shoes and then public to the
85:22 - Internet
85:23 - they make us thinking about another
85:25 - thing so actually it's a it's the two
85:28 - season mallocing yeah that's my idea
85:43 - so what we're seeing projected is
85:46 - actually cameras that are part of the
85:48 - insulation yeah so this is a snake
85:51 - camera it's like the camera people
85:55 - insert to a pipe to see water instead of
86:01 - it has a line in self so it's perfect to
86:04 - my inspirations when there's the camera
86:06 - there
86:11 - just kidding of the way that you're
86:13 - playing with scale here is super
86:14 - interesting thank you I love this little
86:17 - tiny tiny tiny person here will span the
86:21 - hair your girlfriend you're a tiny
86:24 - person watching a few mice
86:31 - yeah that's me those are mine I'm
86:33 - stepping up and down so there's a camera
86:34 - also all the way down here
86:39 - [Music]
86:41 - cool Wow
86:46 - wonderful thank you so much
86:49 - [Music]
86:55 - can I ask you guys about your projects
86:56 - okay so tell me your name and tell me
86:59 - about the project all right this project
87:01 - is themed on dreamers and then we are
87:04 - using the physical paintings that's like
87:06 - going immersive to the paintings so I'm
87:11 - just going to show the demo how it's
87:12 - going to work and then yeah yeah
87:15 - and then first I'm just gonna show how
87:17 - it's going to work so a quick demo you
87:19 - just pick whatever the painting in life
87:21 - here and then just put it up here
87:25 - underneath the
87:29 - and it's gonna be text and then show
87:32 - what you know the paintings on - this is
87:35 - the canvas so just adding more to
87:42 - you
87:46 - so everything has a different particle
87:47 - system so it's going to create something
87:49 - very interesting you know paintings on
87:52 - top of this
87:54 - yeah
88:04 - [Music]
88:08 - love the tabletop interface that's just
88:10 - sort of floating it's really quite
88:12 - lovely yeah
88:15 - and where is this all the content of
88:18 - stuff that you guys painted or is this
88:20 - inspired by producer you know she's my
88:22 - own partner and she painted everything
88:23 - though okay so coming I'll come over to
88:26 - you for a second so tell me your name oh
88:28 - my name is Gina and I'm actually part of
88:32 - the this project and I wanted to create
88:35 - some kind of an interactive painting
88:36 - because my background is fine art so I
88:38 - want to like interact with other users
88:40 - and I want to see them what they are
88:43 - creating by using my pieces awesome
88:47 - great job okay
88:52 - can I ask you sheer to talk about your
88:55 - project I actually came over here and
88:56 - shot a lot of footage of it already and
88:59 - I'm having some trouble here though so
89:00 - I'm now with this camera outside you
89:02 - okay so tell me your name and tell me
89:03 - about this guy my name is shir David and
89:07 - I made nightlight which is a series of
89:11 - 3d sculptures inspired by low-light
89:13 - photography which means that basically I
89:16 - was really missing that moment when you
89:18 - hold photos we're not doing it anymore
89:21 - so I wanted to create a physical object
89:24 - that will represent this moment that we
89:26 - have when you have light falls on our
89:29 - bodies and we capture that in a photo
89:31 - but it's a 3d photo and I have three
89:36 - scenes one of them is a girl standing in
89:39 - front of a bar and the light in this
89:41 - scene is from aniele wire that I had to
89:43 - saw inside the sign and it's inside the
89:47 - pedestal so you actually go into the
89:50 - pedestal to see the whole sculpture the
89:53 - other one I shot my roommate and our
89:56 - fridge and you can actually turn it on
90:01 - and off it's a simple circuit
90:07 - I found at each basement and they were
90:16 - playing Super Mario so they have a tiny
90:20 - television that also shows Super Mario
90:23 - and you can see it here and so what's it
90:29 - was the process of photographing the
90:32 - scenes from from from finding the scene
90:35 - to generating the actual 3d sculpture
90:37 - like I had a few like 10 ideas of like
90:42 - what will be the best scenes to
90:44 - represent this idea of light photos and
90:48 - let's say I thought about the kids
90:50 - around the television like people
90:53 - telling a story around a bonfire like
90:55 - they have something in common something
90:57 - around them the robot is just like
90:59 - something that I see like every day I
91:01 - opened my fridge and I just wanted to
91:03 - have this like sort of moment captured
91:05 - it's some sort of like a weird short
91:08 - moment but it's worth capturing and and
91:12 - the bar I just walked around the city
91:15 - tried to find like a like a really nice
91:18 - bodega that I can fake the lights and I
91:20 - just saw this bar it was washing the
91:23 - street in this pink light and I thought
91:25 - it would be great to like mimic that and
91:27 - and then the scanning was made with a
91:30 - structure sensor on an iPad and you just
91:33 - go around
91:34 - and just hoping that you catch every
91:38 - centimeter of that model of the people
91:42 - and then I had to go to ZBrush and and
91:46 - fill all the holes and create like the
91:51 - best way to put all the electronics
91:53 - inside I'm trying to see it's like what
91:57 - you got there we go there was a moment
91:58 - it's very hard to see the Super Mario
92:00 - like on ball but there we go
92:02 - it's kind it's like so delightful to
92:05 - have it at that scale and to sort of see
92:07 - it there it's beautiful
92:08 - great job thanks to hey okay okay all
92:14 - right everyone I think I might be
92:16 - running out of steam here a little bit
92:17 - and starting to get quite crowded I am
92:21 - going to go and take a moment to sit
92:25 - down in a quieter spot I'll be back
92:32 - and maybe I will take a see if I can
92:34 - answer a few questions so I'm coming
92:40 - into this room here
92:46 - okay all right
92:49 - oh look sunlight amazing alright I'm
92:52 - going to sit down here and turn the
93:00 - camera around a poor Wi-Fi poor
93:04 - connection okay I think I'm bug wrapping
93:08 - up here I've been doing this for an hour
93:09 - and a half and so I can see if I can
93:12 - answer a few of these questions I can
93:13 - see it chat it's all there was a
93:14 - question what languages are they mainly
93:16 - using for the projects there's no a
93:18 - specific answer to that question you
93:22 - know our intro courses are taught with
93:24 - p5.js and Arduino students use a lot of
93:28 - different software tools like After
93:30 - Effects and unity for projects but many
93:35 - of the projects are made with various
93:37 - creative coding type systems okay thank
93:45 - you it's nice to see all these nice and
93:47 - friendly messages I hope you guys
93:48 - enjoyed that this was a quite an
93:50 - experiment for me to try to do this live
93:51 - roaming stream I definitely need to
93:53 - figure out a better way to mount and
93:57 - stabilize the camera the this rig that
94:02 - I'm using worked really well but as soon
94:04 - as I attached the microphone to it I
94:05 - think the waiting of it is off so I hope
94:10 - and play yeah there's a lot of VR so I
94:13 - didn't go into two rooms that are full
94:15 - of VR projects because I didn't think
94:19 - there was an easy way for me to really
94:20 - feature those but there are lots of VR
94:22 - projects at the show yeah I yeah yeah it
94:30 - also would make sense for somebody else
94:31 - to hold the camera I just kind of liked
94:33 - the idea of doing the whole thing and I
94:34 - feel like making someone like follow me
94:36 - around just holding a camera seemed kind
94:38 - of like a I don't want to like torture
94:40 - somebody to have to do that but that
94:41 - would make sense do I know anything
94:46 - about C C++ yeah a little bit use the
94:51 - camera on a helmet that's an interesting
94:52 - idea
94:53 - this particular device that I'm using
94:55 - here hold on I'm going to put the
94:57 - microphone down is this
95:01 - Skylab and it has instructions that I
95:05 - clearly should have read better I'm I'm
95:08 - hoping this worked well enough that
95:11 - machiya and I can work to create a
95:14 - edited version of this like kind of
95:16 - summary of all the projects maybe that
95:18 - would be something that would be in like
95:19 - just about 15 or 20 minutes so we'll see
95:22 - if that can be done I forgot to tweet
95:26 - that I was doing this because I started
95:28 - it then I'm holding the camera so oops
95:34 - how do you get started with connect
95:36 - programming I do have a set of tutorials
95:38 - about working with the Kinect that you
95:41 - could take a look at you know most of
95:44 - the stuff that of the students are using
95:46 - with skeleton tracking is using the
95:49 - windows API the Microsoft official API
95:52 - and to use that you need to download the
95:57 - Microsoft software there is a tool here
95:59 - called connect Tron which I try to find
96:03 - the link to that and post it which
96:04 - allows you to what connect Ron does is
96:09 - it it reads from the Kinect and sends
96:13 - all of the data that the Kinect is
96:15 - reading the skeleton data over
96:17 - WebSockets and then so you can have any
96:20 - application even in the browser or
96:22 - JavaScript application listen to and
96:24 - talk to the Kinect yeah so that's how
96:28 - you can use the Kinect in p5
96:32 - so by the way for those of you who are
96:34 - here right now I got an idea why not
96:37 - pick five suits from the ITP show and
96:39 - have them do a coding challenge the
96:40 - winner gets a teacher I really want to
96:42 - have more guests so I'm hoping to do
96:44 - more of that and what happens to these
96:46 - projects after the show some of them I
96:50 - can show I can show people what books
96:51 - are on my bookshelf yeah I'll do that in
96:52 - a second before I leave
96:55 - some of them everything gets taken down
96:59 - tonight and hopefully they get other
97:01 - opportunities to show them they document
97:03 - them they live on the web they get set
97:04 - up again some of them are websites and
97:06 - mobile apps but they're just here just
97:09 - for today okay I already forgot some of
97:11 - the questions were I was going to show
97:13 - the books as a guest the clean battery
97:17 - yes okay I can definitely try to make
97:21 - that up an oh I don't know if I'm going
97:23 - to unfortunately have a live stream this
97:24 - might be my live stream for this week
97:26 - because tomorrow and Friday there are a
97:28 - lot of graduation and other activities
97:30 - so we'll see what my camera's turn off
97:34 - sometimes because there if you have to
97:37 - do with European tax regulations and
97:39 - they go to sleep after 30 minutes I need
97:41 - to hack the firmware with this thing
97:43 - called magic lantern or some ITP
97:46 - students actually programmer that learn
97:48 - to create yes some we do get students
97:50 - that that do come to ITP with a lot of
97:55 - technical experience already before they
97:56 - arrive here yes you know I think in some
97:59 - ways maybe we do a better job for people
98:01 - who don't have any technical experience
98:03 - before they come to ITP but I'd really
98:05 - ask the students that they might have a
98:06 - differing opinion about that but you
98:09 - know ITP really did start as a place and
98:11 - and still you know one of the sort of
98:13 - core principles and philosophies of to
98:15 - be a place for people from a wide
98:16 - variety of backgrounds and an interest
98:19 - with a broad variety of skills to come
98:21 - together and collaborate yeah them I
98:23 - would say probably the majority of the
98:26 - oops hold on I'm he's gonna try to you
98:29 - know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna I'm
98:31 - gonna I'm done with the gimbal thing
98:32 - hold on everybody
98:34 - turning the gimbal thing off
98:38 - and I'm gonna take the phone I don't
98:40 - know
98:41 - sorry I'm gonna take the phone out of it
98:42 - oh no no don't power off hopefully the
98:44 - streams not gonna die
98:46 - so time is good let's have a look and
98:51 - see always don't throw it up hold on
98:53 - everybody sorry that this is this is
98:56 - torture
98:57 - everybody okay so okay let's look at me
99:01 - I want to look at the front camera okay
99:04 - so what do I have here
99:06 - here's some books fractal geometry of
99:08 - nature mastering regular expressions
99:12 - emergence foundations of statistical a
99:14 - girdle Escher Bach that's great book
99:16 - racing the beam a brick great book
99:17 - spacesuit by Nicolas de Monto local code
99:20 - by Nicolas de Mancha old college
99:21 - roommate of mine a super fandom by Zoe
99:26 - Nair and that's a book that I would
99:27 - highly recommend making things talk I've

99:34 - been using that Turtles termites and
99:36 - profit jams some other stuff back here
99:39 - what else is up here I've got ten print

99:51 - Steven Pinker complexification
99:53 - interactive data visualization by the
99:55 - for the web by Scott Murray getting
99:58 - started with processing vehicles by
99:59 - Brayton burg Foreman code look I even
100:01 - have two copies of that this is a nice
100:04 - HTML and CSS book fooled by randomness
100:07 - here comes everybody by Clay Shirky
100:09 - Black Swan hackers and painters not a ok
100:17 - oops hold on I've got a whole lot of
100:18 - books in in the lower area folks Oh
100:23 - actually there's a the unfortunate thing
100:25 - is the books that I'm actively reading
100:26 - are kind of out here so I don't know
100:28 - what's out here oh do I have two copies
100:30 - of programming collective intelligence
100:31 - all right let me see that let me see I'm
100:34 - going to move this artwork this is
100:35 - jerath or
100:37 - prints I've got a big fry here this
100:42 - office - there's my finger in front of
100:43 - the camera there's a lot of others these
100:47 - are I think so let's see what's down
100:50 - here sorry my fingers in front of the
100:53 - camera I got it okay so we've got
100:57 - assembly language Muybridge algorithmic
101:00 - beauty of plants visual complexity see
101:03 - I've got the C programming language book
101:05 - this is a very old version of learning
101:07 - processing that was like basically
101:09 - printed through Lulu introduction
101:11 - computational media head first physics
101:15 - computational beauty of nature as well
101:20 - so got down here
101:24 - artificial intelligence processing new
101:26 - media reader Universal Street numbers
101:28 - Vincent Scully's architecture book
101:31 - that's from college programming
101:32 - artificial intelligence minor Pro get
101:35 - and some other stuff eight a 95 Wow look
101:39 - at that that's still in here so some of
101:41 - these books I could probably get rid of
101:43 - up here I've got some more deer up deer
101:46 - data processing creative code rules of
101:50 - play generative design guts eat look
101:52 - some detox tea nobody believes me when I
101:54 - say all I do is drink tea I got a lot of
101:56 - stickers here anybody and I even got my
102:00 - coding train mug okay let's see all
102:07 - right so I think I may be UPS my hand is
102:10 - down from the camera again hopefully you
102:13 - guys enjoyed Oh people have been asking
102:15 - for this hold on sorry that I'm so
102:18 - awkward now disaster with the camera
102:20 - here uh there we go people have been
102:25 - asking to see this this is my lovely
102:27 - silver play button ups hold on ah there
102:31 - it is okay that's about it okay here
102:36 - I've been working out some neural
102:37 - network stuff that will be coming soon I
102:38 - got some lovely uh children's drawings
102:41 - and then some neural network bath
102:44 - and let me swap the camera again and
102:47 - move my hand okay I got to turn it this
102:50 - way there we go okay everybody this is
102:53 - the Ben far I'm standing in front of
102:54 - this is also Darwin's Origin of Species
102:58 - color-coded by different editions and
103:01 - used to record the videos in this room
103:04 - which is why you saw a green wall there
103:05 - and why there's a whiteboard there but
