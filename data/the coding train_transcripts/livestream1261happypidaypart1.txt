00:00 - oh hello and happy pi day today is
00:08 - actually nope the date it is March 14th
00:13 - 2018 which is otherwise known as pi day
00:17 - my name is Dan Shipman and you the
00:21 - person behind this circular lens thing
00:24 - are watching the coding train I almost
00:26 - sound like fun fun function for some
00:28 - reason okay so it's I'm doing my
00:31 - livestream today Wednesday I would also
00:34 - like to dedicate this live stream to the
00:37 - late great Stephen Hawking you know
00:41 - gonna pick a day gonna be pi day is a
00:43 - pretty good day and so Stephen Hawking
00:47 - is certainly I could say a lot about the
00:50 - inspirational figure that Stephen
00:51 - Hawking isn't was but I'm gonna go on
00:54 - and just say that we're gonna make some
00:58 - fun stuff we're gonna learn up but I
00:59 - don't know if we're gonna learn anyone's
01:01 - gonna learn anything I'm gonna learn
01:02 - something and I'm gonna do some stuff
01:04 - with PI okay so people are mentioning so
01:09 - I have a new hoodie I don't think I'm
01:10 - gonna I don't gonna wear this too often
01:12 - this is a little bit strange hoodie in
01:13 - fact it is a unicorn hoodie my wife
01:18 - purchased this for me and said please
01:20 - wear this like six months ago and I've
01:24 - gotten around to it but I'm wearing it
01:26 - today special for pi day hopefully that
01:30 - didn't mess up the micro but does have
01:31 - some green on it which is a bit of a
01:33 - problem or feature I guess alright so
01:37 - what's going to happen today
01:39 - I don't exactly entirely know frankly I
01:42 - would like to do a series of in an ideal
01:45 - world I would like to do a series of
01:46 - coding challenges themed around pi the
01:50 - number pi otherwise known as half towel
01:53 - but so that's one thing it's gonna
01:56 - happen I will be using processing I'm
01:59 - gonna do everything in processing today
02:00 - to have a standalone editor that you can
02:02 - download and type the code in and run if
02:05 - you're following along at home or
02:07 - wherever you may be there's actually a
02:08 - new version of processing that came out
02:10 - so I'm going to download that I all
02:13 - wanting for a really long time to do a
02:15 - tutorial about how to build a processing
02:18 - library which involves going into the
02:22 - darkness of Java Docs and eclipse so I'm
02:25 - certainly not gonna start with that but
02:27 - if there is time or if I can even come
02:29 - back for a part two of today I actually
02:31 - worked on it implementing an algorithm
02:33 - to generate the digits of pi in sequence
02:35 - and it takes a very long time so it's
02:37 - kind of a nice it could be a good
02:39 - example for processing library that
02:42 - could be running in the background in a
02:44 - separate thread that gives you an event
02:46 - like just like you have in mousepressed
02:50 - or I don't remember what anything was
02:53 - calls processing it works after event we
02:56 - could have PI event PI digit event and
02:58 - you get a new digit of pi every so often
03:01 - so that might be I would love to do that
03:03 - if not today at some point in the future
03:06 - I also want to say that I am also going
03:12 - to him who's like folding everything
03:15 - into one special livestream so I
03:17 - mentioned pi day I mentioned Stephen
03:19 - Hawking I would like to mention
03:21 - International Women's Day which I know
03:22 - was last Thursday but I am in fact I am
03:27 - running in a half marathon the New York
03:28 - City half marathon this Sunday and so I
03:33 - would like to take a minute to plug my
03:34 - fundraiser for a wonderful organization
03:37 - the Lower East Side Girls Club my goal
03:41 - is to raise fifteen hundred dollars for
03:42 - them thank you to the 14 people who have
03:45 - donated if someone could post a link to
03:48 - this in the chat and certainly if you're
03:49 - watching this an archive the link to
03:51 - this will be in the description of this
03:53 - video
03:53 - the Laurie said Girls Club is a
03:55 - wonderful organization I encourage you
03:57 - to read about them they have many
03:58 - amazing programs they're just a hop skip
04:00 - and a jump away from where I am right
04:02 - now I've participated in some of their
04:05 - educational programs they have an actual
04:06 - planetarium at the lower Eastside Girls
04:09 - Club which is totally amazing and I will
04:12 - be running
04:13 - 13.1 miles which is some amount of Pi
04:17 - this Sunday starting at 7:30 a.m. I
04:21 - don't know maybe you can track me online
04:22 - somehow my goal is to finish in under
04:24 - two hours
04:26 - that's not gonna happen but you know
04:29 - probably two to two hours in ten minutes
04:33 - under well certainly I think habits oh
04:35 - okay so today's pie de pie theme coding
04:39 - challenges Stephen Hawking
04:42 - rest in peace Stephen Hawking Laurie
04:45 - said girls club wonderful organization
04:47 - these PI themed cutting challenges are
04:50 - also in honor of the Lower East Side
04:52 - Girls Club in this fundraiser okay that
04:53 - is all that I will say about that I
04:55 - suppose if you donate during this live
04:58 - stream and your name shows up under
05:02 - recent donations I will thank you live
05:05 - on air I will also take any super chat
05:09 - donations made for the super chat and i
05:11 - will donate those to the lower east side
05:13 - girls club so this is the one day thank
05:17 - you anonymous fifteen days ago this is
05:19 - the one day that I would normally have
05:22 - the super Chad anyway super cat
05:25 - donations I will take okay now
05:30 - Thank You Simon I'm a for your calculate
05:33 - pi in three ways github issue let's now
05:36 - go look and see a few things so first of
05:38 - all let me plug some stuff this is a
05:41 - wonderful program made by a design firm
05:45 - in Boston fathom information design and
05:49 - which is a company led by Ben fry who is
05:53 - the creator of one of the creators of
05:54 - processing along with Casey Reis and
05:56 - what I love about this is it searches
05:58 - through ten million digits of pi and I
06:00 - could look for I don't know one two
06:05 - three four five six so somewhere in PI
06:09 - oh one two three four five six is not in
06:11 - the first 1 million digits of pi one two
06:17 - three does not hold on and go go back
06:19 - but one two three four five is and it is
06:22 - there it's the 49 thousand seven hundred
06:24 - second digit of pi so this would be an
06:26 - interesting kind of coding challenge to
06:27 - make something like this and I have in
06:29 - advance I bookmarked a link to a file
06:34 - that has 10 million digits of pi that is
06:37 - from thank you
06:39 - robbed and Pogo launcher that's really
06:41 - nice of you for your donations that will
06:43 - go towards the lower Eastside girls club
06:47 - and I also bookmarked a file that has
06:50 - from MIT that has 1 billion digits of pi
06:53 - in it so we can potentially use these I
06:56 - thought I'd downloaded these as well I'm
06:59 - curious how big they are let's take a
07:00 - look
07:01 - whoops but what I want to start with I
07:05 - think what I'm gonna I want to open up
07:06 - the github issues in a second here which
07:09 - have suggestions so this is the 1
07:11 - billion let's see let me download this I
07:16 - thought I'd do this already but let me
07:18 - let me download this to the desktop ooh
07:22 - it is about a gigabyte which is you know
07:26 - we're getting 1 billion digits of pi in
07:29 - one file that's pretty good we can work
07:31 - with that we can definitely work with
07:33 - that so we could do something with 1
07:35 - billion digits of pi I don't know what
07:37 - the interesting to compute the average
07:39 - value of all the digits all right
07:46 - oh yes and in the in the chat Chicken
07:48 - McNugget hello chicken mcnuggets
07:53 - suggests calculating pi using the
07:55 - chudnofsky formula and I was thinking
07:58 - about doing this and actually one of my
08:00 - favorite YouTube channel stand-up maths
08:02 - I have to show this to you stand up
08:06 - maths is a YouTube channel from Matt
08:09 - Parker and I'm gonna go a Matt Parker
08:13 - has a video that came out today
08:18 - calculating PI with the trig Nevsky
08:21 - method which you can see is this formula
08:22 - so what's interesting what's amazing
08:24 - about his video that came out today
08:26 - doing this all by hand every year I
08:29 - think this process was possibly the
08:30 - third time he does a video about he does
08:34 - a video about calculating PI from hand
08:36 - by hand and so what I love about this
08:39 - this video speak spoke to me so much
08:42 - because if I if I go along and you
08:45 - should watch this whole thing on your
08:46 - own but I'm gonna skip to a certain part
08:47 - watch this this morning over breakfast
08:52 - okay so right here I'm gonna just
08:55 - narrate what's happening no no a little
08:58 - further okay here so right here he just
09:06 - so this is like this is an edited
09:08 - version of him doing this crazy crazy
09:10 - like long-division
09:11 - thing and it's probably spent hours and
09:14 - hours doing it and at this moment right
09:17 - here he discovers a mistake let me plug
09:20 - the audio in for you so you can hear I
09:23 - just have to change the system
09:24 - preferences I think if I change this
09:27 - you're gonna hear the audio
09:36 - [Music]
09:45 - [Music]
09:54 - so I feel like misspoke so much to me
09:57 - because that goes on and on and on and
10:00 - on and on and on completing the whole
10:03 - entire sequence with this mistake and
10:05 - this I feel like it's what happens to me
10:07 - in every single programming coding
10:10 - challenge I have ever done as you all
10:12 - have witnessed so I encourage you to
10:13 - check out this video it's wonderful I on
10:15 - the other hand would if I'm going to if
10:18 - try to implement this algorithm I would
10:20 - just use the computer to do it which is
10:22 - interesting and actually there's a
10:23 - really amazing um history of calculating
10:26 - PI it's a Wikipedia page I think
10:30 - chronology of computation of PI this is
10:34 - amazing to go through to think about you
10:37 - know how the ancient Egyptians and the
10:39 - ancient Babylonians you know this is
10:40 - pretty good three plus one-eighth I
10:41 - don't know pi PI day complete thank you
10:46 - everybody
10:47 - we have approximated PI here on the
10:49 - coding train I will see you next week
10:51 - but and you could see now where are we
10:54 - we are at this is the most recent world
10:58 - record it took a hundred of five days to
11:00 - calculate million billion 22 trillion or
11:04 - so digits there's a program actually
11:06 - that you can find called Y cruncher
11:08 - there's a Windows and Linux version of
11:10 - this program that you can run to
11:12 - calculate all the digits of pi and I
11:15 - have a processing sketch that I will
11:16 - demonstrate to you I ran overnight I
11:18 - mean it last night I ran over night and
11:20 - it calculated about 8,000 digits of pi
11:22 - it was on a very it was on this like
11:24 - very small computer here so this is
11:28 - super interesting but I am I am going to
11:30 - I'm gonna do two things today the first
11:32 - thing is I'm going to use a method to
11:34 - approximate PI that's kind of an
11:36 - interesting one
11:37 - this method is inspired by a video that
11:39 - came out yesterday over the last couple
11:41 - days from stem coding which is also a
11:44 - wonderful YouTube channel let me go to
11:47 - the github issues so this this was
11:50 - suggested here with approximate PI with
11:53 - physics thank you a Krauss oh and thank
11:56 - you by the way to Matthew in the patron
12:01 - group who made this little happy pi day
12:03 - thing to put in my wallpaper thank you
12:05 - for that so I'm going to go to
12:08 - this issue approximate PI with physics
12:10 - and then I'm also going to reference so
12:13 - the shed Nazi algorithm is referenced
12:15 - right here as well boy wouldn't be nice
12:16 - to do all of these PI approximation
12:18 - where is it pi day where's the one from
12:22 - stem coding did I not label it if I
12:27 - forgot to label it Chris orbit here it
12:31 - is stem coding so one thing I want to do
12:35 - is encourage you to check out the stem
12:40 - coding YouTube channel let me just click
12:42 - to this link I guess which will get me
12:44 - there
12:46 - the stem coding YouTube channel has is
12:49 - has a video doing exactly basically what
12:52 - I'm going to do and also has an
12:54 - incredible amount of other types of cool
12:57 - coding tutorials in other STEM related
13:02 - topics I highly recommend you check it
13:04 - out oh look and they even have me here
13:06 - and stuff from other people we think is
13:08 - great I should make a playlist and I
13:10 - would put stem coding in that playlist
13:12 - for stuff I think is great
13:13 - so I encourage you they have an outtakes
13:15 - and bloopers which is basically that's
13:17 - my entire channel so I encourage you to
13:21 - check that out so let's look though so
13:23 - you can you can find out some more
13:25 - information in this github issue but
13:27 - let's this set as kind of a nice
13:28 - description of the of the first way of
13:33 - the first way that I want to do it okay
13:36 - now so unfortunately I just cameras off
13:40 - I have to erase this whiteboard who
13:45 - really meant to erase it I'm a little
13:47 - bit sad about erasing this whiteboard
13:48 - because I'm in the middle of a series of
13:51 - working on a neuro evolution tutorial
13:54 - where I'm going to create a bot you know
13:58 - or an algorithm to automatically play a
14:01 - simple game like flappy bird and this
14:03 - was where I left off
14:04 - and so when I continue that series I
14:06 - kind of want this to be here but I will
14:08 - just and one is maybe I don't need it
14:11 - and to to I can always rewrite it so
14:26 - 3.1415926 I think that's as far as I
14:28 - know off the top of my head
14:30 - oh we're definitely gonna do a dramatic
14:31 - reading of all the digits of pi today no
14:35 - need for the random number book when I
14:37 - could just oh I forgot to actually
14:39 - that's one thing I would love to make
14:40 - and I could do it in processing by
14:43 - generating a PDF is create the book of
14:45 - Pi and so actually maybe we can take
14:49 - that 1 billion digit files at 10 billion
14:56 - I can't even remember and generate a
15:00 - giant poster with every digit or maybe a
15:05 - book that has multiple pages so one
15:07 - thing you can do in processing pretty
15:08 - easily is render out a PDF
15:28 - hey it's pi day are you excited I'm
15:34 - excited on there's a bunch of stuff in
15:51 - the chat here I like that okay hold on
15:55 - hold on I don't know what's going on
16:01 - okay okay
16:10 - where am I here okay let's see all right
16:15 - just check-in my phone because that's
16:18 - the kind of thing I that's exactly how I
16:21 - roll
16:22 - okay officially turning this to airplane
16:26 - mode putting this away okay now so we're
16:32 - going to begin with this first first way
16:36 - of approximating the digital before I do
16:38 - this let's go to processing org now did
16:43 - it make it on to the website yet three
16:45 - point three point seven yes
16:47 - in honor of pi day three point three
16:52 - point seven which of all these things I
16:59 - want to three heat processing version
17:04 - 3.3.4 tie is a new release of processing
17:13 - we could I believe this this will take
17:17 - me to the release notes a roll up of
17:21 - several fixes Windows Defender blocks
17:24 - three point proof point six fixes to the
17:26 - net library new lines at the end of
17:29 - files rename refactor dialog so this by
17:32 - the way if you're curious this is where
17:34 - you can see all the things that have
17:35 - been change
17:36 - changed inversions of processing this is
17:38 - actually even though the this is called
17:40 - like semantic versioning our semver
17:43 - three point three point seven the point
17:46 - seven being minor changes the point
17:50 - three being media size changes and the
17:54 - three being major changes but the idea
17:56 - here is that in these like minor bug
17:58 - fixes that the API doesn't change the
18:00 - major things aren't broken so okay so
18:02 - but it's actually revision number 264 of
18:04 - processing that's there so let's
18:07 - download that processing if you're not
18:10 - familiar with it is a Java based
18:12 - environment I probably the majority of
18:16 - my videos and tutorials are using p5.js
18:18 - which is a JavaScript JavaScript Java
18:22 - Script where the emphasis is not on the
18:24 - script nobody says it that way
18:26 - JavaScript a JavaScript library for and
18:32 - I like to use that because it's easy to
18:36 - share stuff on the web but sometimes I
18:38 - just have a moment where I would like to
18:41 - use processing and today is one of those
18:44 - movements I also feel like with some of
18:47 - the things I want to do oh if I do a
18:48 - music challenge I might want to use
18:50 - JavaScript just because I have a bunch
18:53 - of p5.js
18:54 - sound examples already that would fit
18:56 - into that okay so let's open up
18:58 - processing let's minimize Ono and I can
19:02 - leave the browser I think I want I'm
19:03 - gonna need some browser windows let's
19:07 - put the code like this by the way
19:14 - there's a different date there's a I
19:16 - shouldn't be doing this today because
19:17 - there's a PI approximation day I forgot
19:20 - what day is pi approximation day
19:22 - major/minor patch yes thank you so some
19:25 - verse technically is your flashlight on
19:29 - on your phone it is it totally is thank
19:35 - you that's going to drain the battery
19:36 - like crazy I must have pressed that by
19:38 - accident major dot minor catch so a
19:44 - patch being a small fix a minor being a
19:46 - minor change or major being a major
19:48 - change
19:48 - okay semver semantic versioning okay
19:51 - how's this font size for you pi day one
20:04 - freaking adding fixing got it that's
20:07 - another way to think about it okay I'm
20:10 - being told that PI approximation day is
20:12 - July 22nd I hope to be like on vacation
20:16 - not making ice true but we'll see III
20:20 - probably what day of the week is that
20:22 - I'll probably be around okay so I need a
20:27 - good marker and I need to be able to
20:32 - draw a circle so what I'm going to do is
20:35 - talk about this approximation method can
20:39 - you hear the squeaking of the unicorn
20:41 - horn I'm going to talk about this
20:43 - approximation method which involves
20:45 - looking at the area of a square and the
20:49 - area of a circle and the ratio of those
20:51 - two is a way to approximate the value of
20:56 - well that's the way to actually
20:58 - calculate the exact value of pi but I
21:02 - can use a Monte Carlo like simulation
21:09 - you have people in the hallway don't
21:11 - really have a soundproof room here what
21:14 - you should do is just pick random
21:16 - numbers out of this random number book
21:17 - see what I want is this is a million
21:20 - random digits I want a book that's just
21:22 - like I'm gonna make this book I'm gonna
21:24 - make this book today I'm gonna print it
21:26 - and sell it
21:26 - I don't know if I'm just selling but
21:29 - I'll open source it I'm gonna make a
21:31 - book that is just ten million digits of
21:33 - pi or 1 billion digits of pi don't know
21:36 - how long it will need to be let's make
21:37 - that book today but first let me do my
21:40 - PI approximation Monte Carlo simulation
21:42 - thing ok here we go
22:04 - oops
22:07 - alright let me open up let me go to the
22:14 - hold on let me get though that's the ten
22:16 - million I really just want the 1 million
22:21 - digits
22:23 - hold on pi pi day let's go to the pi day
22:27 - org ok shop it's just like another is
22:36 - this just like Valentine's Day where
22:37 - this is basically just all made up to
22:39 - sell us hi phoebs merchandise no I used
22:42 - to have a t-shirt I think it was a
22:44 - heaviest in high school that was
22:46 - something something is as easy as pie I
22:48 - think it was math this is gives me pie
22:49 - or something like that but instead of
22:51 - pie the symbol pi it was like this very
22:53 - complicated crazy formula that turned
22:56 - out to be PI all right uh-huh no I don't
22:59 - know why I buzz marketing the pi day
23:01 - shop but i would i wanted to do is go to
23:03 - pi day slash i would just want to have a
23:05 - nice yeah alright this will work
23:13 - actually hold on I got a better idea
23:17 - if you will bear with me for a second
23:20 - slash Schiffman / pi day
23:24 - alright let me very quickly clone this
23:27 - repo this will be a nice okay then let
23:43 - me just open up this code so this is
23:50 - actually implementing I'll talk about
23:51 - this later if I come back to it this
23:53 - isn'ta Banting a an algorithm created by
23:56 - plows Simon plows plows I'm gonna
24:00 - pre-empting it correctly this is
24:02 - actually this is some C code that came
24:04 - from
24:05 - Fabrice Ballard that I poured it to Java
24:07 - and then whoops why do I have oh my
24:11 - goodness this is not the hold your
24:15 - horses everybody
24:16 - why why why why why why am i holding
24:20 - this is the incorrect code you've
24:25 - already make everybody wait I have to
24:28 - push my changes I know why this is the
24:30 - wrong code what was it under Schiffman
24:34 - slash pi day
24:35 - what kind of do a coding challenge in a
24:38 - second I promise
24:39 - PI calc PI Kalki
24:43 - attit this file paste in the more recent
24:47 - file actually thing about it is I kind
24:52 - of am happy with this file this version
24:55 - let me just do this let me just run this
24:56 - let me just I don't need this okay this
25:02 - is actually not the version I want to
25:03 - run but that's fine let's see what this
25:09 - does
25:10 - okay so this is now this I'm going to
25:13 - come back to later let's just make a
25:15 - nice little window okay so you can see
25:21 - this here this is currently calculating
25:24 - all the digits of pi will go on forever
25:26 - this will in theory go on forever but it
25:28 - will start to get very very very very
25:30 - very very slow it's poor little laptop
25:33 - all right happy pi day everybody I don't
25:40 - know when you're watching this but today
25:41 - is March II T it's not March 14th or the
25:46 - 18th it would be pi day it's known as pi
25:49 - day because the first two digits of pi
25:51 - are three while the first digit is 3
25:54 - then I'm gonna adopt endpoint then what
25:56 - let me just start over let's not have a
25:59 - video that has me say the wrong date as
26:01 - amusing as that might be to some of you
26:05 - hello happy pi day today is March 14
26:09 - 2018 I hope I am starting a new
26:11 - tradition to every pi day if I am still
26:14 - doing this next year to make some Pi Day
26:16 - themed coding challenges this is
26:18 - actually a processing program which I
26:20 - will come back and demonstrate in a
26:21 - different video that is calculating all
26:23 - the digits of pi one at a time and over
26:27 - time it's good
26:28 - slower and slower and slower anybody
26:30 - wants to double-check
26:31 - then it's the correct digits you could
26:33 - pause this right now go to PI day.org
26:36 - slash million and you'll be able to
26:38 - compare the numbers I Pro Phillipe i.org
26:40 - is the correct numbers but anyway March
26:42 - 14 3.14 but what I'm going to do in this
26:44 - particular video I don't know why I
26:46 - stopped it um what I'm gonna do in this
26:48 - particular video is show you a method
26:50 - for approximating the value of pi even
26:54 - though I probably should be doing this
26:55 - on July 22nd which is pi approximation
26:57 - day walk or walk out that's not a joke
27:02 - that's for real but I'm gonna do it
27:03 - today anyway so let me show you where
27:05 - this came from this thank you to a crowd
27:09 - 53 on github who suggested this
27:11 - particular idea also to the stem coding
27:15 - YouTube channel which I will link to in
27:17 - this video's description which has a
27:19 - video doing exactly the same methodology
27:21 - in JavaScript and okay so but let me
27:25 - just get right down to it so I'm gonna
27:28 - come back here and I'm gonna create this
27:30 - coding challenge in processing but let's
27:31 - talk about how it works
27:33 - oh hello okay so what is pi
27:36 - well this is first of all otherwise
27:40 - known as half tau for all of you who are
27:42 - already writing lots of things in the
27:45 - comments about how you prefer tau over
27:46 - pi if you're not familiar tau is really
27:48 - two pi hard are tau is talent pi
27:52 - is half mine anyway we have this idea of
27:54 - a circle I'm going to attempt to draw a
27:57 - circle a beautiful beautiful circle now
28:00 - you might have learned at one point in
28:03 - your life if you've taken a geometry
28:05 - class that there is a way a formula to
28:08 - calculate the circumference of a circle
28:10 - and it does a pretty poorly drawn circle
28:12 - but I did my best okay so what what is
28:16 - the length of this line all the way
28:18 - around the circle you know and one way
28:20 - that I could do that is I could get
28:21 - something you know I could get some tip
28:22 - like you know tape measure or string or
28:25 - something
28:25 - wrap it here that unwrap it and measure
28:28 - it precisely and what I would get if
28:32 - this is our whoops if this is our the
28:34 - radius of a circle is I would get the
28:37 - number 2 pi R so I can essentially
28:42 - calculate pi as equal to sorry I'm
28:57 - breaking when somewhere else I could
29:00 - calculate pi as equal to that length if
29:03 - I were to unfurl it that length divided
29:07 - by 2r so if I actually were to measure
29:10 - it and divide it by two R that would be
29:13 - the value of pi now if it so happened
29:15 - that this was 0.5 right we can see that
29:20 - the actual circumference is just pi and
29:23 - that's why we often refer there's this
29:26 - idea of tau I'm not gonna be able to
29:29 - write that up something like this which
29:31 - is just the full circumference it's kind
29:35 - of maybe a cleaner way you don't have to
29:37 - have that too but anyway I don't want to
29:39 - please don't let me down this rabbit
29:41 - hole of discussing five verses down I
29:43 - don't know why I'm doing this let's stop
29:45 - that for right now let's think about
29:46 - something interesting here all right
29:51 - here is a square let's say this Square
29:56 - has this same value R which is that
29:59 - right you can think of this square as
30:01 - the bounding box for this circle okay so
30:07 - the question is so this square is the
30:12 - bounding box for this circle what is the
30:14 - area of this square well we could say
30:17 - the area is this side the sort of height
30:21 - times the width and in this square the
30:23 - height and the width are both two times
30:26 - R so I could say two times R times two
30:29 - times R which would be four R squared
30:33 - okay so that is the area of this square
30:36 - what is the area of this circle well
30:40 - this is also a formula that we can pull
30:42 - from a geometry class it's interesting
30:45 - that it has a relationship to this
30:47 - formula which we which I would love to
30:49 - get into but it is PI R squared
30:55 - so we could calculate pi as a ratio of
30:59 - this square the area of this square to
31:02 - the area of this circle the ratio of the
31:04 - area of this square to this circle is 4r
31:08 - squared PI R squared in other words the
31:14 - R Squared's cancel each other out
31:16 - and the ratio of the area of a square
31:19 - that's the bounding box for a circle to
31:21 - the area of that circle itself is 4 over
31:25 - pi so if I say that ratio is 4 over pi
31:30 - then I can also say pi equals 4 divided
31:34 - by that ratio and if it's the ratio I'm
31:37 - saying I guess I should just done it the
31:39 - other way of saying the ratio of the
31:43 - area of the square of the area of the
31:45 - circle I could have said the ratio of
31:46 - the area of the circle to the area of
31:47 - the square and then I could say 4 times
31:49 - the ratio because I could flip it but
31:50 - that's neither here or there but what
31:52 - I'm going to do boy I'm not so if that
31:55 - is comfortable for you now imagine we
31:57 - have this idea I've talked about it
31:58 - before in other videos this idea of a
31:59 - Monte Carlo simulation and what do I
32:01 - need for a Monte Carlo simulation I need
32:04 - a book of random numbers imagine if I
32:07 - had you know I don't know little I guess
32:10 - darts is the the general thing if I if I
32:12 - could just throw little darts or little
32:14 - sticky things or something randomly at
32:17 - the wall what is the probability that
32:20 - one will land within the circle versus
32:24 - what is the probability that one will
32:26 - land within the square that is in fact
32:31 - going to imagine if we did that
32:32 - infinitely right the total number that
32:35 - would land within the square versus the
32:38 - total number that would land within the
32:39 - circle is in fact the ratio of the area
32:43 - of the square to the area of the circle
32:44 - so in that sense we can't do this
32:47 - infinitely we can't fill every instant
32:49 - decimal point we could of course with
32:51 - something known as calculus or some type
32:53 - of math and then actually calculate the
32:55 - the reveal value of pi and we've there's
33:00 - other ways to do that but I could get an
33:01 - approximation like if I just did 10
33:02 - numbers you know ma'am you know just
33:04 - think about this for a second what if
33:06 - what if
33:08 - [Music]
33:09 - - sorry what if I got to in the circle
33:16 - and one in the square so and and by the
33:19 - way the two that are in this the two
33:22 - that are in the circle are also in the
33:24 - square I'm terrible at explaining this I
33:27 - should have practiced this timeout I
33:29 - just need a break for a second
33:32 - have I done any of this camera went off
33:34 - have I done anything horribly wrong
33:39 - am i making sense
33:51 - call length see eta is the real circle
33:56 - constant Sunday July 22nd good font okay
34:02 - no I I don't see anything in this chat
34:03 - chat that's telling me I'm doing
34:05 - anything horribly wrong I do see someone
34:09 - saying why does he act so weird I wish I
34:15 - had an answer for that question I almost
34:18 - want to just like start over again
34:19 - because I feel like I explanation took
34:21 - so long because I wasn't really I didn't
34:24 - really have a plan for this did I get
34:30 - the right symbols for tau are you guys
34:35 - going hope said you're gonna be if I
34:38 - just start that whole explanation over
34:40 - because I kind of want to redo it with
34:43 - the ratio of the area of the circle to
34:47 - the area of the square I guess for it
34:50 - it would be I mean I guess it doesn't
34:52 - really matter I got the area of the
35:03 - square wrong
35:10 - circumference whole length see
35:12 - circumference that makes sense
35:15 - Taotao is correct okay
35:17 - yeah but I didn't really I didn't really
35:22 - wait to gosh what day is today my flash
35:28 - you guys are cows correct all right all
35:32 - right all right everybody square equals
35:39 - 4r squared which is what I got the
35:41 - area's correct all right so but all
35:42 - right I think I'm gonna um just for
35:46 - insanity sake if you don't mind I know
35:49 - this is kind of torture for you I want
35:51 - to give myself another shot at this
35:53 - because I feel the issue that I have
35:55 - with what I just did is that I think
36:03 - that I was a little just went on too
36:06 - long about various things and I would
36:09 - like to have as a record of this day a
36:12 - cleaner and more concise tutorial
36:21 - all right generalize it to an oval and
36:25 - make it fullscreen
36:26 - great suggestion everybody oh no but I
36:28 - now I have to do this and this I'm like
36:32 - lost my marbles here all right that's
36:33 - fine sorry everybody but I promise I
36:39 - don't know what I promise you know go
36:43 - take a break go outside have a cup a cup
36:46 - of tea breathe do some meditation up in
36:49 - about 10 minutes I'll be back to where I
36:51 - was or five minutes cuz it should be
36:53 - much shorter hello happy pi day I admit
37:03 - this is take number two I kind of messed
37:05 - up the first time I am going to do a
37:07 - coding challenge where I am going to
37:10 - approximate the value of pi now what's
37:12 - running here right now is the actual
37:16 - number pi I mean so what you fact check
37:19 - that this is correct you compare it to
37:22 - pi day org slash billion which I think
37:24 - had
37:24 - the first million digits of pi but this
37:26 - is a processing sketch using a
37:27 - particular algorithm to calculate all
37:29 - the digits of pi one at a time it will
37:31 - go on forever it will get very very very
37:34 - slow pretty quickly I will come back to
37:36 - this in a future video but what I'm
37:38 - gonna do in this video is is look at a
37:41 - way to approximate the value of pi now
37:43 - this came in as a suggestion from
37:46 - originally from a Kraus fifty-three on
37:48 - github for how to look at random
37:51 - particles that end up in a circle or
37:53 - outside of a circle interesting that's
37:55 - something to do with the area of the
37:57 - circle so I'm gonna diagram this out I
37:59 - should also mention thank you to the
38:02 - stem coding youtube channel and a stem
38:05 - coding project which has a ton of videos
38:08 - in various topics using programming and
38:11 - coding to teach different types of STEM
38:13 - related topics it's wonderful they have
38:15 - a video you can find a link to it in
38:17 - this in this video's description
38:18 - basically doing exactly the same thing
38:20 - that I'm about to try to do probably
38:22 - better but you know I'm gonna do my best
38:25 - if you'd give it my all and I'm gonna do
38:27 - this in processing which is a Java based
38:29 - programming environment if you're not
38:31 - familiar with it I'm sure I'll link to
38:33 - some video where I talk about what
38:34 - processing is okay we're gonna let this
38:35 - run and I'm gonna come over here to talk
38:37 - about a method that I'm going to use to
38:40 - approximate the digits of pi now there
38:45 - is something in our world known as a
38:48 - circle it is a beautiful round shape it
38:52 - is a shape that I'm not going to be able
38:54 - to draw but I'm going to attempt to I'm
38:57 - gonna move over here just give myself
38:58 - more room here is a circle now if you
39:02 - were to look up formula for
39:05 - circumference of a circle or you would
39:08 - find that it's equal to something called
39:10 - 2 pi R this is the formula for the
39:15 - circumference of a circle now what are
39:16 - these things well two is the number two
39:19 - R refers to the radius Center to the
39:23 - edge R this is the same length anywhere
39:27 - from the center of circle to any edge
39:28 - point and pi well this is this sort of
39:31 - magic number 3.1415926
39:37 - that's all I can remember I might not
39:39 - even gotten to in the six right good
39:42 - we're gonna approximate it well here to
39:43 - see if we can get better than my memory
39:45 - tells me so how can I use this fact to
39:49 - calculate the number pi well one thing I
39:51 - could do is I could get a piece of
39:52 - string and I could wrap it around here
39:54 - in my perfect circle that he could undo
39:56 - the string I could get a tape measure I
39:58 - could measure it and then whatever that
40:00 - is if I knew the value of R I could
40:02 - solve for the value of pi that would
40:05 - work I should mention by the way just
40:07 - because I know someone's gonna say
40:08 - something in the comments and it's not
40:10 - today today is not towel day I'll come
40:12 - back and do this with tau but tau is a
40:14 - number the Greek letter tau or tau PI
40:19 - being spelled with English letters or
40:22 - Roman letters P I is essentially well pi
40:28 - is half tower tau is 2 pi I don't know I
40:31 - don't want to get into which one is
40:32 - which but this is often used because
40:34 - then we could say the circumference is
40:36 - just tau R but there anyway this opens
40:39 - up a big can of worms that I don't want
40:41 - to go down so I'm not gonna do this
40:43 - string method let's look at another two
40:46 - formulas from geometry so so one thing
40:48 - is what's the formula for the area of
40:50 - this circle
40:51 - well how's it it looks quite similar and
40:53 - there's a special relationship there
40:54 - that's a topic for another time but PI R
40:57 - squared so PI R squared is the area of
41:00 - this circle now let's think of thing
41:03 - what if I put a square as a bounding box
41:08 - in that circle a perfect square I can
41:09 - draw that over here with this idea of
41:12 - our being here
41:13 - so the sides of this square are twice
41:16 - the length of our the area of the square
41:19 - is the width of a rectangle as the width
41:21 - times the height a square just being the
41:22 - side squared so the area so this is the
41:26 - area of the circle the area of the
41:28 - square is 4 4 2 times 2 is 4 R squared
41:34 - so look at that 4 R squared PI R squared
41:39 - now imagine something there's a
41:42 - relationship here right there's a
41:43 - relationship between the area of a let's
41:47 - say the area of the circle to the area
41:49 - of the square that relationship can
41:51 - be expressed as a ratio I could say the
41:54 - area of the circle PI R squared
41:56 - - the area of the square for R squared
42:00 - the RS cancel out the ratio is pi
42:03 - divided by 4 or I could say that pi
42:08 - equals 4 times that ratio in a way but
42:15 - what do I mean by this exactly what I
42:17 - mean well who I say here why are we even
42:19 - here how am I going to use this to
42:21 - approximate so in the in the original
42:23 - github post it said well simulate it
42:25 - with physics so we could imagine one
42:27 - physic scenario is throwing darts what
42:30 - if I were to just throw random darts on
42:32 - the wall at the wall well that would go
42:34 - all over the place some darts would land
42:38 - within the square but not in the circle
42:41 - and some darts would land within the
42:44 - circle but not within the square so in a
42:48 - way I can kind of imagine the ratio of
42:52 - the area of the circle to the area of
42:55 - the square as the number of darts that
42:58 - land within the circle divided by the
43:01 - number of darts that have landed in the
43:02 - square now three have landed in the
43:04 - circle and four have landed in the
43:06 - square so I could say pi in this case pi
43:09 - is approximately four times the circle
43:14 - count divided by the square count which
43:21 - is equal to 3 divided by 4 4 times 3
43:25 - divided by 4 is what 3 so there is my
43:29 - approximation of pi 3.0
43:34 - so that's right I mean it's not very
43:37 - good but only through four darts the
43:38 - more darts that I throw the more and if
43:41 - I did this infinitely if I filled this
43:46 - the more darts that I throw the more
43:49 - darts that I throw if I did this
43:51 - infinitely and fill the entire space I
43:53 - would get closer and closer and closer
43:55 - to a better approximation of the number
43:58 - pi so this is what I'm going to
43:59 - implement in code now I really really
44:01 - want to just use for my dart throwing
44:04 - the
44:05 - numbers from this million random digits
44:06 - book I'm tempted to use the random org
44:10 - API which gives but I think I probably
44:12 - just use the processing random function
44:13 - which is a pseudo-random generator
44:15 - that's another topic but that I will
44:18 - come back to okay so let's go over the
44:19 - code did I say Roman oh did I fix the
44:33 - equation oops
44:39 - what's wrong with the equation no this
44:44 - this is supposed to this is okay sorry
44:48 - yes so actually before I go to the code
44:51 - I wrote this in such a weird way what I
44:53 - mean is four times the circle count over
44:56 - the square count is equal sign was sort
44:58 - of a problem there I'm replacing the
45:00 - circle count with three the square count
45:02 - with four so it's four times three over
45:03 - four and that's how I get three
45:05 - apologies for that
45:09 - did I say Roman letters Roman letters I
45:18 - think I meant Latin Latin alphabet or
45:22 - the Roman alphabet that's kind of the
45:24 - same thing I guess some missing the
45:30 - letters J and U and W were added at a
45:33 - later stage I don't know is that okay I
45:37 - was just trying to look look where we
45:39 - are here we're still getting some digits
45:46 - all right we'll have to leave in the B
45:49 - things
45:50 - okay so lemme let me come back to the
45:52 - code I just want to see here sketch okay
45:58 - great
45:59 - all right do that again
46:01 - that's you will edit this later I'm glad
46:04 - I did that over I think that was better
46:05 - alright so I'm back in the code look at
46:07 - this we're still getting digits of pi
46:09 - here bro slowly over time I'm fortunate
46:10 - I'm gonna stop this program and I'll be
46:12 - running again later and I'm gonna go to
46:14 - a blank sketch whoops
46:17 - I'm just
46:18 - to close this and I'm gonna go to a
46:21 - blank sketch okay so what are the first
46:22 - things that I need to do let's create a
46:25 - window that's 400 by 400
46:27 - let's give it a background of zero yeah
46:30 - zero that's fine stroke 255 then let's
46:34 - call the ellipse function at and let's I
46:38 - think life our life might be easier if I
46:40 - just do translate to the center to put
46:45 - the zero zero at the center yeah why not
46:54 - and so the ellipse is going to be at 0 0
46:56 - with a radius a radius of 200 the
46:59 - ellipse function expects a diameter so
47:03 - the radius is 200 the diameter is 400
47:06 - and then we're gonna do we're gonna say
47:07 - I'm gonna say no fill and I'm going to
47:12 - say rectangle also 0 0 400 400 and let's
47:16 - say stroke wait for whoa Oh Rex mode and
47:25 - I wanna say rekt mode Center okay and
47:30 - let's make the size actually a little
47:33 - bit bigger so I can sort of see the
47:36 - outline now here's the thing I kind of
47:38 - have a I kind of have a crazy idea so
47:42 - here's the thing
47:43 - I am I for me to calculate whether it's
47:46 - inside the circle or not use PI and I
47:51 - kind of for some weird reason I want
47:53 - this code to not use Pi at all I mean
47:56 - there's a distance function and
47:58 - processing that I could use which
47:59 - ultimately which behind the scenes uses
48:03 - actually no no it doesn't use I don't
48:07 - have to use pi hmm no I don't have to
48:10 - use a pot oh yes I do the distance oh no
48:11 - no that doesn't function use it the
48:12 - Pythagorean theorem scratch that
48:15 - so I'm gonna be fine ok nevermind so
48:20 - what I do is I want to fill this I want
48:24 - to fill this window we maybe we could
48:28 - add that could possibly edited out my
48:30 - tía that
48:32 - random people don't want me to edit
48:34 - these videos too much so whatever anyway
48:36 - I get what I want to do now is I want to
48:38 - start throwing the darts so I'm gonna
48:41 - use the Processing's random number
48:43 - function which is random and I'm gonna
48:46 - say right here I'm gonna do this at the
48:48 - end let's do this at the end of draw
48:50 - draw is a loop that happens over and
48:52 - over again if you haven't used
48:53 - processing before and this is the java
48:55 - programming language with extra set of
48:58 - functionality for drawing x equals
49:00 - random i'm just saying and let's let's
49:02 - actually let's make a variable a global
49:05 - variable called R which is equal to 200
49:08 - so I'm gonna say R times 2r times 2r
49:11 - times 2r times 2 I'm gonna make a random
49:17 - number between negative R and R and a Y
49:22 - which is a random number between
49:24 - negative R and R then I'm going to draw
49:29 - a point at that X Y so let's do our dart
49:33 - throwing okay look at that so one thing
49:35 - is I'm getting something starry
49:37 - flickering thing so I really want to
49:39 - just draw this in setup as kind of the
49:43 - initial background and then I don't want
49:45 - to redraw the background again but I
49:47 - think I probably will need the translate
49:51 - in both places there we go so now you
49:56 - can see I am filling the space with dots
50:01 - so now what I need to figure out as I
50:04 - need to count the dots that are well I
50:07 - know the total dot and actually all of
50:09 - the dots I don't have to test if dots
50:12 - are within the square because I've set
50:14 - this up in such a way that it basically
50:16 - can only create dots that are within the
50:18 - square so what I need to do is determine
50:20 - how many dots are within the circle so
50:23 - let me do this I'm gonna say if R if so
50:26 - first I need to get the distance what is
50:29 - the distance between 0 0 and X Y so this
50:32 - is how far from the center is that point
50:35 - to be honest i weirdly in all every case
50:40 - of life I would use the distance
50:43 - function but
50:44 - some reason right now I feel like it's
50:46 - worth noting that pi is not being used
50:49 - here that the distance function is
50:52 - actually using the Pythagorean theorem
50:56 - because if I know the x offset from the
50:59 - center and the y offset from the center
51:01 - then this hypotenuse of this right
51:04 - triangle x squared plus y squared equals
51:07 - H squared eighth best Pythagorean
51:09 - theorem H is the square root of x
51:11 - squared plus y squared so I I kind of
51:13 - want just for the some weird arbitrary
51:16 - sense of purity to say square root of x
51:20 - times X plus y times y and if that
51:25 - distance is less than less than or
51:27 - equals or just less than let's say less
51:30 - than mmm this is just an approximation
51:31 - anyway less than R I'm going to say
51:35 - stroke stroke let's make it a greenish
51:40 - color okay here we go
51:43 - otherwise stroke 255 here we go oops and
51:49 - I need another curly bracket here we go
51:51 - so we can see now and let's let's make
51:55 - it a I don't know I'm gonna pick some
51:58 - arbitrary colors that are gonna not look
52:00 - very nice I'm gonna do my best and here
52:05 - we go so we have two different colors we
52:07 - have this kind of Greek ooh I pick
52:09 - colors that are quite similar so I write
52:14 - I could by the way I could do this
52:15 - without randomness I could just check
52:17 - all of the pixels but I like I like the
52:19 - random method and let me let me make
52:23 - these colors quite a bit more different
52:25 - there we go so we can see I've got some
52:27 - blue ones and you can see if they're on
52:29 - the line you know depending on where
52:31 - they are because I have a stroke width
52:32 - of two they're either blue or green so
52:34 - that could use some finesse in the chat
52:36 - the live chat that's going on I see
52:37 - someone's asking what is float float is
52:40 - the datatype so unlike in JavaScript
52:42 - which a lot of my other tutorials in I
52:43 - would just say let X or var X or context
52:47 - depending on how I feel London begins a
52:49 - float is a floating point decimal number
52:51 - okay now so now we need to do is we need
52:56 - to count so what I'm gonna do
52:58 - I'm gonna say I'm gonna say I'm gonna
53:01 - say I'm gonna use an integer total
53:04 - equals zero and int circle equals zero
53:07 - so this is going to be total it's going
53:09 - to mean the total number of dots circle
53:12 - is going to be the number of dots that
53:13 - are in the circle and what I'm going to
53:16 - do is I am going to say now I'm going to
53:21 - look back at my formula write pi equals
53:25 - four times the total number of circle
53:28 - divided by the total number of total so
53:33 - pi and I'm going to say P ie just not to
53:36 - be confused with the actual there is a
53:39 - constant called pi that's available in
53:42 - processing I guess I could do lowercase
53:43 - PI processing wouldn't but I'll just say
53:45 - PI because pi is delicious pi equal
53:48 - that's really like gonna be upset people
53:51 - float pi equals 4 times circle divided
53:56 - by total and let's put those in
53:58 - parentheses just for fun now here's the
54:00 - thing there's a couple problems with
54:01 - this number one total I don't want total
54:06 - to be zero it will never be zero because
54:09 - I'm going to immediately say total plus
54:10 - plus like as soon as I pick a point I'm
54:14 - increasing so at least the first time it
54:16 - runs through this total will be one and
54:18 - then of course if it's within the radius
54:20 - circle is plus plus and so let me say
54:24 - print line pi so let's just look it
54:27 - let's run this and see what we get I
54:29 - keep getting a zero why do I get zero I
54:33 - don't get anything so this has to do
54:35 - with integer arithmetic so integer math
54:38 - these are both integers circle and total
54:41 - so even if I say 10 divided by 20 that's
54:45 - 0 remainder remainder 10 or 20 divided
54:48 - by 19 divided by 20 is 0 remainder 19 so
54:54 - it's always going to give me the 0 so I
54:56 - need to explicitly convert one of these
54:58 - to a float I think I might change this
55:00 - to double to for more precision but this
55:03 - should now give me you can see here I am
55:06 - slowly and slowly getting closer and
55:09 - closer
55:10 - perhaps to the value of pi' let's let
55:13 - this run for a little bit so so I'm
55:30 - reading oh I lost the chat yeah Roman
55:39 - alphabet okay good that's so the
55:44 - question is am i getting though this
55:48 - will be added out am I getting numbers
55:50 - that are a little bit too high
55:51 - through randomness or is my or dual its
56:03 - float just gonna send me in the wrong
56:05 - like what's the reason why as though
56:07 - let's come back here all right
56:17 - okay I'm back I've let this run for just
56:20 - a couple minutes you can see that I'm
56:22 - not really I had some kind of getting
56:24 - something that looks kind of like pie
56:26 - I'm a little bit higher than pie so I'm
56:28 - to ask myself the question what's going
56:30 - wrong here well my one guess that I have
56:33 - is that I haven't been so exactly
56:34 - thoughtful about my distance check that
56:38 - maybe that that like sort of border of
56:40 - what's on the line versus not on the
56:41 - line is something that I need to think
56:43 - about more deeply the resolution is it's
56:48 - kind of an issue there but the other
56:52 - issue might be just the way that
56:53 - floating point math works in the Java
56:56 - programming language I might need a
56:57 - different data structure data type that
57:00 - allows me for sort more precision so
57:02 - hold on I'll be right back I'm going to
57:04 - make some adjustments in the code okay
57:13 - let's take a look let's see if we can
57:14 - think about this well look at this
57:17 - beautiful drawing by the way so the
57:20 - question is is let's let's just change
57:23 - this to this for a second because it
57:26 - should be okay if it is I would think
57:29 - it's okay if it's equal yeah a hundred
57:35 - loop okay yeah yeah ditch the drawing
57:38 - randomness it's closer okay
57:44 - should it here's my question is it
57:47 - technically correct for it to be equals
57:49 - or not equals I don't think it's not
57:53 - it's technically I mean here's the thing
57:56 - we're not gonna we're not gonna pick a
57:58 - point that's exactly point zero zero
58:00 - zero zero so I think it's actually not
58:01 - gonna make a difference but I don't
58:04 - think I think equals it's not within the
58:06 - area right yeah infinitely small amount
58:11 - so I'm gonna leave that alright
58:23 - so okay
58:26 - well one issue is so look at this nice
58:29 - drawing first of all one issue is
58:31 - certainly that I'm spending all this
58:33 - time drawing just to get like one point
58:36 - at a time 30 frames or 60 frames per
58:38 - second so one thing I can absolutely do
58:40 - is there's no reason why I couldn't just
58:42 - put a little for loop in here and say
58:44 - hey let's do a hundred points per frame
58:48 - and what I'm going to do I don't want
58:54 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say let's
58:58 - make a PI a variable outside of that
59:02 - loop just so when the loop finishes I
59:04 - can take a look at what the value of pi
59:05 - is so now I can do a hundred points at a
59:07 - time and you can see how much faster
59:09 - this is sort of filling up the drawing
59:12 - and we can now go look and see what have
59:15 - I got here
59:16 - yeah so I think I think we just have a
59:18 - lot of randomness here and now I'm
59:21 - getting 3.14 when it's you know we're
59:24 - converging it as best we can so I think
59:27 - we've done a pretty good job at
59:28 - approximating pi think maybe I could
59:30 - actually be done a couple things that
59:33 - people noted one is I could actually get
59:36 - rid of the square root from this program
59:38 - and just look at r-squared that could be
59:42 - my comparison that's gonna square root
59:44 - is very slow expensive calculation I
59:47 - could fix some white space here another
59:51 - thing that I could do is let's just try
59:52 - this with like ten thousand and see what
59:58 - we get
60:00 - pretty good birthday birthday birthday
60:03 - pie all right thank you everybody
60:07 - this is meat oh no no no no let's let's
60:13 - go a little step further let's use
60:16 - doubles so what is a double a double so
60:21 - as you know any numbers that we have in
60:23 - a program yeah and and and and the of
60:32 - stroke weight stroke weight yes
60:34 - okay okay I'm getting good getting good
60:37 - good good points here all right let's
60:44 - see if using double actually does
60:47 - anything so what is a double so
60:48 - processing natively actually doesn't
60:50 - really support the double data type any
60:54 - number that you have in a variable is
60:57 - stored in memory and so floating point
60:59 - numbers there's an infinite amount of
61:02 - decimal numbers between any two integers
61:04 - but we don't have an infinite amount of
61:06 - memory on our computer so we allow
61:08 - locate a certain number of bits so
61:09 - floating points allocate a certain
61:11 - number of bits doubles allocate more so
61:14 - if we really need to do precise
61:16 - mathematics and then there's other Java
61:18 - classes and implications for really big
61:20 - numbers but let's at least change this
61:22 - to double let's change this to double
61:27 - and I'm gonna I'm gonna have to use
61:29 - casting because double is not and I'm
61:34 - gonna change this you're just going to
61:36 - change this to double as well I'm gonna
61:38 - be really I'm gonna overdo it I don't
61:40 - need to I think I need to change all of
61:41 - these but now I should see that this and
61:44 - by the way I don't need to calculate it
61:47 - I don't know why I did that I can just
61:49 - calculate it once there and I wrote
61:51 - float and let's make this double okay so
61:54 - now let's take a look at this and one
61:56 - thing we can see is already there are
61:58 - more digits appearing in the print line
62:01 - statement and maybe maybe I think that
62:04 - just so much randomness that's part of
62:06 - this that ultimately ultimately I'm not
62:12 - so sure that we're gonna get much
62:14 - anything that's really that accurate out
62:17 - of this method but it is nice to see
62:18 - we've consistently got one point for one
62:21 - now which is right if only we could get
62:26 - a five here one point four one five
62:28 - let's see we get a five here come on get
62:31 - a five five five consistently so maybe
62:34 - over time as we do this over and over
62:36 - again now one thing might be it may be
62:37 - look at make could we make this drawing
62:38 - any prettier I mean one thing that I
62:40 - might choose to do is make a stroke wait
62:44 - that's actually more like it's actually
62:47 - at
62:48 - that's more like point one so a very
62:50 - light stroke maybe you can't see that it
62:54 - also makes a stroke weight of one but
62:55 - maybe give some alpha so some
63:01 - transparency there we go this I don't
63:03 - know it's kind of interesting looks kind
63:05 - of like I'm looking under a microscope
63:06 - I'm gonna let this run for a while and
63:08 - I'll just be back in a couple minutes to
63:10 - check where it got to okay so one thing
63:22 - my back my back so I could try to be
63:24 - more precise about this oh I don't think
63:34 - that's gonna matter though because these
63:36 - are all going to be oh no wait hi sorry
63:38 - oh the camera enough anyway boy that
63:43 - made a mess of this I actually I'm back
63:55 - because I got a good comment from the
63:56 - chat which is that I could choose to try
63:58 - to make this test a bit more precise so
64:01 - I could make this a double I could cast
64:04 - the X as a double and again I'm gonna
64:07 - just overdo it and cast everything so
64:16 - let let's take a look at let's let's
64:20 - cast all those as doubles and let's run
64:23 - this one more time we can see it filling
64:26 - up here and it seems to be running at a
64:29 - perfectly reasonable frame rate so I'm
64:31 - actually gonna try to do this ten
64:32 - thousand times per frame well now it's a
64:36 - little bit slow so I cut I want my
64:39 - animation to be fast oh that was that
64:42 - was a hundred thousand let's just go
64:45 - with ten thousand okay so let's take a
64:47 - look okay I'll be back in a minute let's
64:49 - see how many digits we can kind of get
64:50 - and see how close we're doing
64:57 - all right let's let's let this run for a
64:59 - while to see if it converges at all
65:01 - because those numbers over time should
65:04 - get very very big yeah of course I
65:07 - should store R times R as a variable so
65:13 - unfortunately the processing random
65:15 - function won't give me a double won't
65:20 - give me a double natively yeah could
65:30 - also save the best one yeah yes okay
65:37 - that's a great suggestion all right I
65:41 - got an idea
65:42 - all right hey then back again so you can
65:47 - see this kind of algorithm it's not
65:49 - gonna converge very quickly there's a
65:50 - lot of noise in it from the randomness
65:52 - but one thing I could do to add to this
65:55 - program is try to keep track of which
65:56 - one is the best so there is in Java
66:01 - natively let's let me take out this
66:04 - print line for a second and what I'm
66:07 - gonna do so I'm gonna say print line so
66:11 - processing natively has the constant pi
66:14 - but Java also has the constant pi that
66:18 - is in the math package so let me look at
66:21 - both of those and you can see that that
66:22 - one is a double so this is the actus is
66:25 - actually what's stored is not that many
66:27 - digits in math dot Pi in Java so what
66:31 - I'm going to do is I am going to create
66:36 - I'm gonna create a variable called
66:39 - record pi and I am going to set record
66:45 - PI equal to zero just as its initial
66:50 - value I don't need to set it down there
66:51 - I'm sorry I can just set it up here then
66:53 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
66:55 - look at double the difference between
66:58 - math dot pi minus record pi and let's
67:04 - take the absolute value of that and I
67:09 - also need to oh can I guess I have to do
67:13 - math dot absolute for because I have
67:15 - doubles so I'm gonna take the difference
67:17 - between matha pi and the record pi then
67:21 - so this is actually really the record
67:23 - difference then I'm going to look at the
67:27 - difference between the PI I just
67:31 - calculated my Oh
67:33 - math dot pi minus the PI I just
67:36 - calculated so if if the difference is
67:40 - less than the record difference if we've
67:42 - gotten one that's closer then the
67:47 - difference is now the record difference
67:51 - is now the difference and the record PI
67:58 - why did I use an underscore did I use an
68:00 - underscore that's sort of unnecessary
68:02 - record pi equals zero and then record PI
68:09 - then record PI is that new pi and what I
68:14 - could do is whenever I have a new record
68:16 - I could print out record PI so let's
68:21 - take a look and see what I get in the
68:23 - console there and in a way I kind of
68:26 - want to do that every time because I
68:30 - feel like I should give it a chance this
68:34 - is not a big calculation to do I might
68:36 - as well do this every single time even
68:38 - though I'm only drawing every so often
68:40 - so let's put all this inside of this
68:42 - loop and let's run it and we can see the
68:47 - this is now currently the record one
68:50 - point four one five nine two six hey I
68:55 - know I don't know like how many digits
68:57 - have I gotten correct
69:10 - pausing for a second see if we get
69:12 - anything better
69:14 - so what's alright so let's go look at
69:19 - the actual digits of pi so I'm gonna go
69:22 - to PI day.org / million and I don't need
69:28 - that many of them this is gonna be
69:32 - plenty just the first line here
69:34 - let's open up TextEdit let's put this in
69:38 - here and let's make this a little bit
69:43 - bigger let's go back to the processing
69:46 - sketch oops let's bring this down here
69:51 - how many did it so I have and let's take
70:00 - a look and compare so so far we have
70:09 - gotten one is correct 4 is correct one
70:13 - is correct five is correct nine is
70:14 - correct two is correct
70:15 - six is correct five is correct my font
70:18 - size is not the same ah have I gotten as
70:25 - close as I can get no no this is wrong 6
70:30 - is correct 5 is correct 3 is correct ah
70:33 - okay so I'm just gonna give myself a
70:36 - couple minutes to take a short break and
70:37 - I'll come back and see if anything got a
70:39 - little closer
70:47 - why not just rip the difference I could
70:51 - do that I should plot it converging
70:59 - definitely should plot it as a new
71:03 - number popped up I don't think it has
71:15 - yeah I could use math dot random know
71:21 - the so tone in the chat is asking the
71:24 - size is 400 to our is 200 is that
71:27 - messing things up it's not messing
71:29 - things up because I still have drawn the
71:34 - I'm I am picking the random numbers
71:37 - using just are so I'm not using the
71:41 - width and height of the screen that's
71:42 - just a little extra space to draw which
71:45 - is silly and unnecessary now we still
71:52 - have this four here
71:54 - we're not able to get a five yeah
72:16 - alright so I'm gonna wrap this up
72:21 - alright thanks for watching this coding
72:23 - challenge there are so many ways this
72:25 - could be improved you could sort of plot
72:27 - the difference you could visualize these
72:29 - numbers and kind of like highlight which
72:31 - digits are correct which are incorrect
72:33 - there's so many you could think about
72:34 - how you're drawing this you could get
72:37 - your you could make the random numbers
72:39 - double that you're picking I don't know
72:40 - if that would really help you could use
72:42 - my favorite website random orbit as an
72:44 - API for random numbers is really not
72:46 - gonna make your program run faster but
72:48 - there is so much that you could try to
72:51 - do so if you make something with this
72:57 - coding challenge please share it with me
72:59 - in the comments below you can also go to
73:01 - the coding train com website there's a
73:03 - place where you could link to your
73:04 - shared version I will also release a
73:06 - JavaScript version of this that you can
73:08 - run in the browser and maybe actually
73:10 - that's a might be an easier way to also
73:12 - display the results so thanks for
73:14 - watching I hope you enjoyed this pi day
73:16 - coding challenge so lots of there's lots
73:27 - of questions in the chat have I made any
73:29 - horrible errors I don't think so if
73:32 - difference is greater than the record
73:34 - this difference so only thing that I'm
73:37 - keeping globally is the record PI and
73:41 - yeah is the record PI so I calculate the
73:43 - record difference yeah ok yeah I'm gonna
73:49 - don't worry I'm gonna do more it's only
73:51 - 12:20 right now I'm gonna do something
73:54 - that this can't be it for today so
74:00 - somehow I spent an hour and 20 minutes
74:02 - doing this and my intention was for this
74:04 - to be like a 20 minute video hopefully
74:06 - it will get edited down up so I need to
74:08 - remember
74:09 - yeah PI from processing is a float but
74:11 - I'm didn't use PI from processing I'm
74:13 - using math PI yeah
74:18 - Oh a new number printed
74:28 - I got better we got cool a new number
74:36 - printed that's exciting now we just need
74:39 - to get a nine there I mean actually it's
74:44 - not that we need to get a nine here it's
74:46 - not necessarily gonna make it closer
74:47 - like if this were like an eight or a
74:49 - nine that would be getting a closer
74:50 - right it's just that like I want the
74:51 - number to match but you have to remember
74:53 - these are the you're not more correct
74:56 - based on which digits are equal here's
74:58 - more correct based on the actual
74:59 - difference between the two yes so there
75:04 - are all these interesting sequences and
75:06 - things let me save this okay so a couple
75:08 - things one I'm going to do is so in
75:10 - order to try to relief the edited
75:12 - version of this today I'm gonna hit stop
75:15 - recording so I'm no longer recording to
75:17 - disc
75:18 - and I'm gonna go open up my Google Drive
75:20 - here and I'm gonna upload that video
75:23 - file that I just recorded because I
75:24 - think not just gonna try to add this so
75:26 - even in like very soon I might release
75:28 - the edited version of I mean very soon
75:31 - being at some point today so it comes
75:33 - out on pi day let me go to preferences
75:36 - sorry I have to do this for a second you
75:39 - can listen to this dots off so just give
75:46 - me a moment here March 14th is today and
76:02 - I am now uploading the recorded version
76:05 - of this
76:12 - hopefully this is not going to mess with
76:14 - my streaming bandwidth and then I'm also
76:18 - going to clear some space on this hard
76:21 - drive all right so now I am uploading
76:54 - whoa I did something weird whoa
77:03 - something weird is happening I'm
77:04 - downloading all these files why am i
77:06 - downloading all these files sorry
77:10 - everybody if they're still in echo it's
77:20 - just an echo and I'm playing the music
77:22 - the echo is because I can is I can oh I
77:29 - know I D echos there I forgot about this
77:32 - issue because I changed the sound before
77:36 - this should help a little bit
77:42 - now there should be no echo I can't hear
77:47 - the music though okay no I think I'm
78:00 - okay now I just need to clear some
78:05 - harddrive space there an echo now is
78:16 - there an echo now Rasmus Toland in the
78:28 - chat rightz the PI you calculated has a
78:30 - precision of one point zero zero zero
78:32 - zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
78:34 - zero zero three to seven which is pretty
78:36 - good I think so too I forgot oh I've got
78:39 - a new number no we still owe we gotten a
78:41 - baby I think we got a new number but
78:42 - it's we've still got this digit these
78:46 - digits this needs to go to an 8 mega
78:48 - needs to go to a 9 so pretty good okay
78:57 - so let me think now what am I gonna do
79:00 - next I would like to do something visual
79:03 - so first of all
79:11 - I should have printed this out
79:18 - I would like to read to you some digits
79:24 - of pi normally I would read from my book
79:32 - of a million random digits instead I
79:35 - would like to read to you from a book of
79:37 - Pi if somebody would like to songify
79:43 - this for me it would bring me great joy
79:50 - 3.14159265 three five eight nine seven
79:53 - nine three two three eight four six two
79:57 - six four three three eight three two
80:00 - seven nine five zero two eight eight
80:03 - four one nine seven one six nine three
80:06 - nine nine three seven five one zero five
80:10 - eight two zero nine seven four nine all
80:14 - right and then you can use some kind of
80:16 - magic computer program thing right
80:18 - because I could just say zero one zero
80:20 - one two three four five six seven eight
80:25 - nine you can chop all those up and then
80:28 - I could say all the digits of pi forever
80:31 - and ever think I have a couple different
80:32 - versions like zero one two three four
80:36 - five six seven eight nine zero one two
80:42 - three four five six seven eight nine all
80:50 - right all right I definitely could not
80:55 - do it with a blindfold all right so
80:56 - those you know I forgot to hit record I
80:59 - actually I wasn't recording this to disk
81:00 - that's fine though it will be in the
81:02 - YouTube Pantheon forever and ever
81:05 - okay now I'm recording to disk again now
81:08 - what I would like to do is make some
81:10 - visualizations based on pi and let me
81:14 - look at the ten million digits that's a
81:20 - billion I don't I don't think I'm that's
81:21 - a gigabyte file I don't thing I'm gonna
81:23 - do anything with the O first I since I
81:28 - was saying today is a fundraiser for the
81:30 - lower Eastside girls
81:33 - donated anything half-marathon this
81:36 - Sunday I did get a donation thank you
81:38 - thank you to Peter Carrero from $25 I
81:44 - will read Peter Carrero some more digits
81:47 - of pi no one's gonna want to donate cuz
81:48 - it will just be here read more digits of
81:50 - pi these digits of pi are dedicated oh I
81:54 - know I am at 675 so let's go and find
82:03 - 675 appears at the 576 digit of pi thank
82:09 - you to fathom information design and so
82:11 - I will now read these digits of pi
82:13 - dedicated to peter carrera who gave a
82:15 - nice donation to the ilaria site girls
82:17 - club thank you six seven two five two
82:20 - three eight four six seven four eight
82:22 - one eight four six seven six oh yeah
82:25 - numberphile has a video called pi is
82:27 - beautiful which goes through a bunch of
82:29 - different visualizations so let's make
82:31 - something so I want to get let's get the
82:34 - ten million digits of pi and let's save
82:39 - this to the desktop and how big is that
82:47 - that file is just ten megabytes that's
82:49 - no problem I'm gonna hit save I'm gonna
82:52 - do save as pi day to let us get that 10
83:00 - million digits file and what I'm gonna
83:06 - do is oh wait I'm gonna do a coding
83:09 - challenge okay so oh yeah six seven five
83:18 - appears it's a five seven six whoa well
83:26 - let's go back and look at that again
83:28 - [Music]
83:33 - 675 these sound effects are Piggly Lane
83:51 - yeah that's crazy I did not know that I
83:54 - did not check that on purpose we have
83:56 - found more beauty in the number pi than
84:00 - we could ever imagine
84:01 - Wow alright what's going on here in this
84:04 - mug of tea alright so now we're going to
84:15 - do another Pi Day themed coating
84:18 - challenge I will mention again if you
84:22 - feel so inclined this pie de pie day is
84:25 - dedicated I you know I didn't intend for
84:27 - this to happen obviously but this live
84:31 - stream is dedicated to the great late
84:33 - Stephen Hawking who died today on pi day
84:36 - but what my intention was was this also
84:38 - to be a fundraiser for a wonderful
84:39 - organization that I like to support
84:41 - which is just a small number of blocks
84:44 - from here
84:45 - Laurie side Girls Club I'm running a
84:48 - half marathon on Sunday raising money
84:50 - for them if you feel so inclined please
84:52 - donate I'll match any donations that
84:55 - come in through super chat give them to
85:00 - the lower Eastside Girls Club okay thank
85:04 - you now alright so I have this alright
85:12 - so let me at least type in set up and
85:14 - draw the one that I kind of liked
85:19 - visually which I think might be
85:21 - interesting to try I mean I hate to I
85:23 - don't really love the idea of copying
85:25 - somebody else's design up certainly
85:28 - would want to credit them and I wouldn't
85:30 - make it as beautiful as them let's see
85:33 - if any new issues have come in that
85:35 - aren't labeled it doesn't look like it
85:40 - okay so I can go to the pi day label
85:42 - oops not completed pied a label and what
85:52 - I'm looking for is this one I really
85:59 - like this this the one that I like whoa
86:01 - okay how look scary City skyline search
86:08 - or search for words is a really
86:10 - interesting one let's visualize aspects
86:13 - that make up pie oh I just look at that
86:15 - one what's wrong with me turtle graphics
86:18 - and just this will not work
86:20 - unfortunately at least the way that I'm
86:22 - that I'm thinking about it we'd like to
86:24 - come back to that to see if there's a
86:25 - way draw a circle with pie numbers this
86:27 - is the one yeah
86:28 - so this is a this image is created by an
86:36 - artist is this the Kootenay I thought
86:39 - the name of the artist started with an M
86:41 - oh it is also Albert Einstein's birthday
86:47 - today hi dais an interesting day
86:49 - certainly for for sure
86:51 - we're let's look at pi is beautiful on a
86:55 - number file which I think has links to
86:57 - this artist and I yes Christian Leo's
87:06 - vos heels so let's let's go to there
87:12 - should be a link to I thought there was
87:17 - a link to I guess this this will do the
87:24 - art of Pi yes science art okay and so
87:28 - the one that I'm thinking of is circular
87:32 - art yes here we go
87:38 - I just want to make sure I so anyway
87:45 - this is an interesting one distribution
87:47 - of the first so I what I'm trying to
87:49 - think of progression and transition so
87:51 - I'm trying to think of what is a way
87:53 - that I can you know one way would just
87:56 - be to like visualize them on a grid and
87:57 - just like with a color for each digit oh
88:05 - look at that so so that one that you
88:16 - sent Alka that's also from Christian
88:19 - vassal I know if I'm pronouncing the
88:21 - name correctly Christian Vasile how is
88:25 - that one done because it looks like
88:26 - there's a difference there's a different
88:35 - there's it's not just like nine the
88:37 - other you know the other thing I like is
88:38 - making a polygon with a certain number
88:40 - of sides based on the digit which is
88:42 - kind of fun
88:44 - visualized on a pie find pie in pie made
88:49 - with circo's I don't know what that
88:51 - means so I'm trying to think of what's a
88:54 - simple way of visualizing it well we
89:00 - could do frequency so I like the idea of
89:02 - something simple so let's do something
89:04 - simple and let's just do frequency I
89:06 - think that'll be interesting to try so I
89:10 - want it like let's find Christian
89:12 - vassula let's is this that's a Romanian
89:17 - singer a visual art okay ten studying
89:25 - images show that beauty hidden in pie
89:27 - yeah whoo I love this one this is from
89:31 - Martin Krasinski artist by accident yeah
89:35 - so this one yeah well look at all these
89:40 - alright so this is good set of
89:42 - inspiration I won't make anything that's
89:44 - nice so I think we can
89:50 - I'll calculate pi on a Raspberry Pi
89:52 - alright so we're gonna do something to
89:54 - visualize pi and we have a data file
90:01 - that has 10 million digits which is way
90:04 - more than we need oh I don't want to
90:05 - open that data file up I kind of want to
90:11 - just quickly make that into a data file
90:12 - that has 1 million digits so let me
90:17 - quickly do that so I'm going to go to
90:23 - I'm gonna say up high equals load
90:26 - strings was it pi what was it called PI
90:36 - - 10 million I just think it'll be a
90:37 - little easier to work with a 1 million
90:39 - we just test this out oh I don't know
90:44 - what I'm doing here string so I just
90:51 - want to say print line pi dot length did
90:54 - it load it into just one yep so there's
90:56 - just one thing so pi is the first
90:59 - element there so this is giving to me pi
91:07 - and then what I want to do is say pi
91:09 - equals PI dot substring 0 1 2 3 1 2 3
91:13 - and then I want to say output is a
91:20 - string array with one thing in it output
91:24 - index 0 equals now PI then I want to say
91:26 - save strings PI 1 million dot txt so
91:31 - this should if I'm right this is a quick
91:40 - little program Oh output okay
91:47 - so this is a quick little program what
91:49 - I'm doing here is I'm loading all 10
91:52 - million digits into a string and load
91:56 - strings in processing loads everything
91:57 - into an array but there's just one
91:58 - element to the array so I just want the
92:00 - first element array
92:01 - then I want to get just the first
92:03 - million digits
92:04 - hopefully that's million and then put
92:07 - that in an output array and save that to
92:09 - another text file okay so I think this
92:13 - will be exclusive so I want zero through
92:16 - nine hundred and ninety nine thousand
92:17 - nine hundred ninety nine which i think
92:19 - is correct so let's let's run this and I
92:24 - probably should have and we should say I
92:26 - now have a file called PI 1 million
92:30 - which is just one megabyte and TextEdit
92:34 - will have a much easier time opening
92:36 - that up great so I can take a look at
92:40 - that where these numbers correct earlier
92:45 - yeah they look right ok
92:53 - all right yeah I'm going to ignore three
93:01 - in the dot though three in the dot
93:02 - aren't in that file and I'm gonna ignore
93:04 - them okay
93:09 - all right so so if I wanted to I could
93:16 - say this that would give me the full
93:18 - string but so let's do something visual
93:23 - with them I have an idea okay
93:38 - and okay
93:44 - all right ready everybody oh good that
93:46 - went out hello and happy pi day part 2
93:57 - I'm gonna do another coding challenge
93:59 - and this coding challenge will be about
94:01 - visualizing the digits of pi so I'm
94:03 - gonna use a file that I've prepared of 1
94:06 - million digits of pi I also will include
94:09 - links in this video's description to a
94:10 - file with 10 million digits and a file I
94:13 - think that has a billion digits I can't
94:14 - remember which one I found but various
94:15 - people have posted files with a lot more
94:17 - digits that I'm gonna use so you might
94:18 - be interested in trying it out with even
94:20 - more digits cuz boy let's just make as
94:23 - many digits as we can now this is
94:24 - inspired by two artists I'm sure I'm
94:29 - gonna polish for mispronouncing the
94:31 - names but Martin Chris Nowinski and
94:32 - Christian ba ba SIL who have made
94:37 - Christian Ile Elise Vasile who have made
94:40 - a whole lot of beautiful images
94:42 - visualizing the digits of pi so I
94:45 - encourage you to check out this
94:47 - Washington Post article I'll link to
94:49 - that there's also a wonderful
94:50 - numberphile video called the beauty of
94:53 - Pi or something like that that I will
94:54 - link to that goes through some of their
94:56 - visualizations I'm gonna try to do
94:57 - something really simple so let's get
95:00 - started by loading those digits so first
95:03 - what I want is I actually want to have a
95:05 - string because I want to take all the
95:07 - digits of pi and put them in a string
95:09 - although ultimately maybe I'll break
95:10 - that into an array of integers but
95:12 - that's how they're gonna come in they're
95:14 - coming in from a text file so I'm gonna
95:15 - call it pi just P I lowercase I don't
95:18 - want to say P I uppercase because that's
95:20 - a built-in constant in processing let's
95:22 - just arbitrarily have a window that's
95:24 - 400 by 400 then I'm gonna say pi equals
95:27 - load strings so load strings is a
95:30 - function that's part of processing this
95:32 - is processing by the way Java based
95:34 - programming environment that what it
95:36 - actually does is it loads and I have a
95:40 - file it's right here PI - 1 million dot
95:43 - txt you can see those are a lot of
95:45 - digits in that file so I just need to
95:48 - reference the file name here we go file
95:51 - name now what this actually I'm getting
95:54 - an error here and what is that error
95:56 - that error is
95:58 - mismatched Java dot lang dot string
96:00 - bracket bracket does not match with Java
96:01 - dot laying dot string the reason why
96:03 - this doesn't match is the processing
96:04 - load strings function takes in your data
96:07 - into an array and this is actually often
96:09 - quite useful especially if you have data
96:10 - in multiple lines because it takes every
96:13 - line from the text file and breaks it
96:14 - into an array but this text file just
96:16 - has one line so I can actually just take
96:19 - zero just the first element to that
96:21 - array and I'm gonna say print line pi
96:24 - just to see if this appears in the
96:26 - console oh boy
96:27 - I'm gonna freak it out because it should
96:30 - be a million digits there let's say PI
96:32 - dot length to make sure I have a million
96:34 - digits oh oh I forgot in the Java length
96:42 - for a string is a function I was like
96:45 - whoa I'm so used to programming in
96:46 - JavaScript in Java length for the string
96:48 - as a function so I'm gonna say dot
96:49 - length and there we go I've got one
96:51 - million digits of pi we're cooking here
96:54 - now we're cooking okay so let's actually
96:56 - break that into an array so let me make
96:59 - an array called digits which has 1
97:02 - million spots in it and I wonder if
97:06 - actually actually I don't need to
97:07 - initialize it because I think I can say
97:11 - string I'll call it f digits equals PI
97:17 - dot split and if I give it know if I say
97:23 - split with no delimiter so this is like
97:27 - splitting the string but splitting it
97:28 - based on no delimiter this should give
97:30 - me an array with a million strings in it
97:32 - so I should be able say let's just see s
97:35 - digits not lengths this is an array so
97:37 - with an array I don't need the
97:38 - parentheses because it's not a function
97:41 - it's actually just the property of the
97:43 - array let's look at that 1 million 1
97:48 - million yeah so I've got a million and
97:50 - now I can and then again this is not
97:52 - necessary the most efficient way I can
97:53 - actually just I think processing has a
97:55 - function called int which will just
97:57 - convert that array entirely into
98:00 - integers so now if I say print array and
98:04 - I probably am going to overload the
98:06 - console here but I'm gonna do it anyway
98:08 - I'm gonna hit save and I'm gonna run it
98:11 - I now have a look at this I am now
98:13 - printing the entire million digits of pi
98:17 - into the console just try loading the
98:21 - billion digits and pretty to the console
98:23 - see how long it takes what am i up to
98:24 - I'm gonna get to I'm gonna get to a
98:25 - million before I finish talking there we
98:28 - go you can see on that last digit there
98:30 - is one okay so now I have all these
98:32 - digits what can I do so many things
98:35 - right I could just fill the screen with
98:37 - all the digits and I could be surrounded
98:40 - by the digits of pi now I mean either
98:41 - way I almost want to stop this now and
98:43 - say hey be creative make something I
98:46 - think what I'm going to try to do is
98:47 - visualize the frequency of the digits so
98:50 - let's just actually make a simple line
98:52 - right let's say there are 10 digits so
98:57 - I'm gonna go I equals 0 so I'm gonna
98:59 - make I'm gonna make an array called
99:01 - counts and as 10 spots in it okay and so
99:08 - and then I'm going to also have an
99:09 - integer which is like current digit
99:12 - which will equal 0 so the first thing
99:14 - that I actually current index I'll just
99:17 - call that index because what I want to
99:19 - say is current digit equals PI digits
99:26 - index and then I'll go to the next index
99:30 - I got to worry about when I get to a
99:31 - million I'll deal with that later right
99:33 - so I could look at the current digit
99:35 - then I could I have made something
99:37 - called counts already and I could say
99:39 - counts current digit plus plus so I'm
99:42 - going to increase the count for each
99:44 - current digit and then what I will do is
99:47 - let's just draw a little let's go let's
99:52 - start with x equals zero I say let's use
99:55 - I I equals 0 I is less than counts dot
99:59 - length I plus plus and I could do a
100:02 - little math here I can say the width is
100:04 - the width of the window divided by count
100:07 - length and so that's X is going to equal
100:13 - I times width and Y is going to equal
100:17 - just a height divided by two so I'm just
100:19 - going to draw something in the middle
100:20 - how about an ellipse and I probably
100:23 - should offset it by
100:25 - half the width so X comma Y and I'm just
100:28 - gonna draw some circles oh boy let's get
100:33 - rid of that console that print line
100:34 - that's gonna be a problem
100:36 - apologies everybody and I probably
100:40 - should make a smaller file data file to
100:42 - work with while I'm developing this but
100:44 - you can see now I just got a whole bunch
100:46 - of circles now what I want to do is
100:50 - actually let me make the size of the
100:54 - circle the size of the circle relative
101:00 - to the the number of digits there are so
101:04 - counts index I why is that giving me an
101:08 - error float does not match with int
101:10 - that's fine let's can let's make this an
101:14 - int so the more times oh this is this
101:19 - should be an int that's that's my
101:20 - problem the index into the array as to
101:22 - be an int I don't know why I put a float
101:23 - there this can be a float because it can
101:25 - convert it so now if I do this what
101:29 - we're seeing is every time it finds one
101:33 - of those digits it's growing that circle
101:35 - now they're just gonna go bigger and
101:36 - bigger and you can see well the
101:38 - distribution is somewhat even have I
101:41 - really discovered anything interesting
101:42 - here I'm not so sure let's put these in
101:47 - the path of a circle that'll be more
101:49 - interesting so first of all let me give
101:51 - this a background here and let's think
101:55 - about this so okay so let's actually
101:57 - make let's think about polar coordinates
102:00 - for a second so I'm going to say angle
102:06 - equals map I which goes from zero to
102:09 - count's length to between zero and two
102:12 - pi pi is appearing now right I want to
102:15 - get an angle all the way around a circle
102:17 - and then I want my X to be some radius
102:22 - so like let's say let's say 200 in this
102:27 - case 200 times cosine of that angle and
102:30 - this is me converting from polar
102:32 - coordinates an angle and a radius to
102:35 - Cartesian coordinates I have a video
102:36 - about that that I will link to if
102:38 - is unfamiliar territory to you y equals
102:40 - 200 times sine of that angle so and then
102:45 - let's also translate to the middle of
102:54 - the window because I want to I want to
102:55 - offset everything from the center of the
102:57 - window and let's take a look and see
102:59 - what this gives us so now you can see I
103:02 - am now put them all around them this is
103:04 - this is this is digit 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
103:11 - so I've I have I have normalized in the
103:15 - past zero so I don't know if this size
103:17 - is really that interesting one of the
103:20 - one of these artworks if I scroll down
103:22 - here actually what it does and this it
103:25 - doesn't in a more sophisticated way is
103:26 - it's connecting digits to the next digit
103:28 - that would be super interesting to try
103:31 - let's try that so I actually need to
103:34 - look at the next digit in this case
103:36 - right so I don't need to worry about
103:38 - this counts stuff I actually don't even
103:42 - need to worry about this loop thing okay
103:44 - hold on let's let's figure this out
103:46 - let's so let me save this I'm gonna say
103:49 - this as pi day 3 because I'm gonna I'm
103:51 - gonna rip this apart now for a second so
103:53 - let me let me take this out let me get
104:00 - rid of all this count stuff and let me
104:05 - say digit equals digits index and then
104:08 - let me say next digit equals digits
104:11 - index plus 1 so I'm going to look at
104:13 - each digit and the next digit now what
104:17 - I'm going to do is I'm going to say
104:22 - angle 1 equals and I might as well use
104:26 - the math function digit which goes
104:27 - between 0 and 10 between 0 and 2pi I
104:33 - could pre-compute all these locations
104:36 - angle 2 is next digit so now I just need
104:41 - to do that polar to Cartesian
104:43 - transformation again again I'm going to
104:45 - say 200 times cosine of angle 1 y1
104:51 - equals
104:52 - 200 times sine of angle 1 I'll do the
104:55 - same thing for X 2 and y 2 sine of angle
105:01 - 2 cosine of angle 2 and now what if I
105:04 - draw a line from X 1 X 2 to y 1 y 2 so
105:09 - this is me looking at every digit the
105:11 - next digit mapping those points taking
105:14 - those points around a circle and
105:15 - connecting them let's see what this does
105:19 - beautiful
105:21 - guess what the default stroke for a line
105:24 - in processing is black so let's make the
105:26 - stroke 255 okay so this is working I
105:31 - think let's uh let's make the window a
105:34 - little bit bigger so that there is let's
105:37 - draw a nice let's put move background to
105:41 - setup and let's draw a little circle
105:44 - also so let's say stroke 255 let's grab
105:50 - the translate here also and let's say no
105:55 - fill I just want to draw a little circle
105:56 - so we can see that path and I'm going to
105:58 - say 0 0 200 200 that 200 should
106:02 - definitely be a variable and let's try
106:04 - this again oops so the size of the
106:08 - circle is 400 400 right because it's the
106:11 - width so what have I done wrong here
106:17 - why are these points around a square
106:20 - pattern
106:28 - and hold on pause for a second what do
106:32 - they do wrong here these should be Oh
106:40 - with divine no that's fine
106:43 - am I using width and height somewhere
106:45 - else everything's from the center why
106:52 - are these points not on the edges of the
106:54 - circle something is wrong here that I'm
106:56 - not seeing the line function oh my
107:03 - goodness
107:07 - look at this
107:08 - probably everybody has been yelling at
107:10 - me when you watch this whole video the
107:11 - lines aren't totally the wrong place
107:13 - x1y1 to x2y2 the line function takes the
107:17 - first point and the second point and
107:20 - this is all messed up okay
107:23 - so now let's run this again there we go
107:26 - so now you can see that I am filling up
107:29 - the space now honestly all it kinda
107:31 - looks like is everything is connected to
107:33 - everything which of course is the case
107:35 - so maybe what I need to do is think
107:37 - about color think about blending think
107:41 - about those positions there so but
107:44 - you're seeing here some interesting
107:45 - possibilities here so I haven't really
107:48 - made anything so beautiful that wasn't
107:50 - the point of me making this video the
107:52 - point of me making this video was to
107:54 - show you how to load all the digits of
107:57 - pi how to iterate over them and how to
107:59 - start thinking about drawing based on
108:01 - them and if you look through and read
108:04 - this Washington Post article or think
108:06 - creatively on your own I am sure you
108:08 - will come up with your own pie drawing
108:11 - so please share pie train uno hashtag
108:19 - pie train on twitter go to the coding
108:22 - train comm and submit your there's a
108:24 - there'll be information there at the
108:26 - page for this coding challenge of how to
108:28 - submit your version of it share it with
108:30 - me on Twitter share it with me in the
108:31 - comments I would love to see your
108:33 - visualization of all of the digits of pi
108:37 - yeah so in the chat I'm being told oh
108:40 - add some randomness Oh
108:41 - randomness to those locations that would
108:44 - certainly help I guess I could do that
108:45 - before I leave I mean I'm not going
108:48 - anywhere but like I could and Gaussian
108:49 - random this might be nice but like what
108:51 - if I just say oh today it's a sorry
108:55 - let's add a little bit of randomness
108:57 - each time actually the randomness should
109:00 - be in between whatever the the
109:05 - difference between each angle is so hold
109:08 - on the difference between two angles is
109:12 - 2pi divided by 10 so I want to pick
109:16 - something random in between there let's
109:21 - try that let's try that just to get a
109:23 - little something and then let's make
109:24 - this stroke wait stroke let's give it
109:27 - like some alpha and now we can see I
109:32 - don't know whether I've made anything
109:34 - better necessarily but but you can see
109:40 - this is like a variation on this theme
109:42 - so you you the viewer of this video are
109:45 - a more creative visually talented person
109:47 - than I am that I am sure of so I don't
109:50 - want to go too far of this I'm not
109:51 - adding any color I'm not being
109:53 - thoughtful about those positions the
109:54 - circular idea is just one idea a grid is
109:56 - another idea somebody suggested making a
109:59 - skyline based on the digits of pi
110:01 - there's so many designs that you can
110:02 - think about making based on the digits
110:04 - of pi and another thing that I'm gonna
110:06 - do in the next video is look at how to
110:09 - think about scale so this is me just
110:11 - making it in a processing sketch but
110:12 - what if I want to it does kind of look
110:14 - like the moon which is pretty
110:15 - interesting what if I want to render out
110:19 - the digits of pi to a giant high
110:21 - resolution poster so I'm gonna look at
110:23 - that in the next coding challenge thank
110:27 - you
110:30 - oh yeah this is incorrect
110:33 - this should really be like alright no no
110:37 - I got it right okay the original one is
110:42 - remembering the count of the digit N and
110:44 - then moving down the amount of the arc
110:47 - allocated to that digit oh that's
110:50 - interesting
110:53 - did you watch the three
110:55 - one Braun videos that a new video from
110:57 - today I did not if I you did let's take
111:00 - a look at this again goodness
111:02 - hi moon this is the here this is hereby
111:05 - referred to as the pie moon the question
111:08 - I have is just to be clear about this I
111:12 - think why this isn't so interesting I
111:15 - mean is that like if I just say this
111:27 - actually what would be interesting I
111:29 - said I have to blow my nose
111:30 - hey would be the count immediately the
111:37 - count how many times the digit appears
111:39 - the same digit in sequence thank you oh
111:43 - sorry for your ears there digit like in
111:52 - other words if I just do this right if I
111:59 - just pick random digits you know I
112:02 - really am I gonna have anything that
112:04 - really is the set is that different let
112:07 - this run for a minute so one thing I
112:09 - want to do now and it's a little bit
112:10 - silly for me to do this in processing
112:12 - perhaps is I want to make the book of Pi
112:16 - so that question is like can you really
112:18 - tell the difference between this where
112:20 - I'm just picking random digits or not
112:23 - but I do feel like that was enough to
112:26 - instigate some creativity add the index
112:29 - map down from zero to a million to zero
112:32 - to two pi divided by 1000 that's
112:38 - interesting so okay I don't know why I'm
112:43 - all sniffily all of a sudden alright so
112:45 - what I want to do now I'm gonna leave
112:49 - that as is the point of what I'm doing
112:53 - again is not to is not to make something
112:58 - beautiful but to kind of give people the
113:00 - beginning steps okay so let's do pi day
113:04 - for
113:08 - um so what I want to do now mmm at one
113:20 - point I'm just looking here eleven okay
113:25 - so let's make something that's 11:50 I'm
113:28 - by 800 pixels will not show up
113:31 - oh that's landscape I mean I'm an 800 by
113:37 - 1150 that will not show up so what I
113:46 - want to do now is make the book of Pi
113:58 - and I can leave it as a string okay and
114:10 - I'm gonna get rid of draw and what I'm
114:13 - gonna do is I'm gonna go to processing
114:17 - dot-org library's reference but a PDF
114:30 - export the only thing about this single
114:33 - frame multiple pages this is what I want
114:38 - next page yeah this is what I want but
114:47 - let me do a single page first which this
114:51 - is the easiest way to do it I the way
114:53 - that I usually do it is with this begin
114:55 - record and record because I want this
114:58 - screen display no screen display I want
115:01 - the screen display can I do multiple
115:02 - pages with begin record and record
115:12 - [Music]
115:16 - what's the next page PDF next page can I
115:20 - still get this and do next page so I
115:23 - just want to test something what I want
115:27 - to do let me just test something forget
115:29 - about this for a second
115:31 - I want to do is I want to say I just
115:36 - want to understand how this works before
115:38 - I do the challenge begin record book of
115:47 - Pi then I want to say and I also want to
115:54 - get the renderer and render it doesn't
116:04 - need the import the library this is a
116:07 - renderer not exist if I'm using begin
116:09 - record let's see this might work I
116:14 - wonder if I need to say it afterwards
116:15 - let's do this let's say it's just say
116:18 - line 0 0 with
116:21 - height then what I want to say is PDF
116:25 - next page I'm gonna say line with comma
116:32 - zero so let's say background zero now
116:43 - let's say background 0 with 0 0 height
116:50 - stroke let's see if I can do multiple
116:53 - pages and screen display and then I want
116:57 - to say then I think I say end record so
117:01 - sniffily ok let's see if this works
117:10 - no so I think I can only do the next
117:15 - page thing if I use this let's see if
117:17 - this will do it require a path so I
117:23 - could make the poster of Pi I'm not
117:27 - gonna see I guess I could just so now I
117:30 - don't need I don't need to begin record
117:33 - and I don't eat and record let's just
117:34 - even see if this works
117:37 - well I think I need to say exit ok so
117:43 - now I should have a PDF book of Pi one
117:48 - to two pages view thumbnails yep one two
117:54 - now there's a little things are a little
117:57 - off here v 11 5800 we run this again
118:09 - and I want the background to be white
118:11 - stroke to be black on this again now if
118:19 - I go here into preview oh great great
118:22 - there we go but I want a little bit more
118:25 - space let's try this okay great yep this
118:36 - is working and I just want to see
118:39 - something I just want to see P font F
118:45 - equals create font courier let me just I
118:51 - just want to use I want to use a I just
118:55 - want to use a fixed-width font because
118:59 - it'll make all of our lives much easier
119:01 - let me just say text so let me say fill
119:05 - 0 text hello I don't know 400 400 or on
119:21 - this again yep oh it didn't do it oh I
119:27 - have to say text font F I'm just
119:31 - remembering how PDF works in processing
119:40 - there we go
119:43 - and if I were to say now let me just now
119:47 - I'm I'm going crazy here let's string pi
119:55 - if I were to say text PI zero zero with
120:06 - height see what happens here
120:12 - uh-oh this is gonna take a little bit
120:15 - longer people oh wait hold on
120:26 - substring let's be more thoughtful about
120:29 - this okay yep M pi equals I kind of just
120:41 - doing this in advance I'm gonna I'm
120:43 - gonna start the Cody I've actually
120:45 - figured I should really stop this is
120:47 - enough okay I got I got it because I had
120:50 - to do this as a coding challenge first I
120:52 - have to really really blow my nose like
120:54 - all these nose blowing moments have been
120:56 - very inadequate so I'm now going to mute
120:59 - myself I'm going to mute the microphone
121:16 - [Music]
121:30 - okay I hear that there are okay I hear
121:37 - that maybe there are close to 314 likes
121:39 - on this video which is exciting
121:41 - all right
121:58 - [Music]
122:02 - let's get rid of this okay
122:16 - no why just do this now at the beginning
122:18 - of every video welcome to another Pi Day
122:22 - theme Konak challenge
122:23 - this coding challenge I'm going to make
122:26 - the book of Pi so one of my favorite
122:29 - things that I have is a book called a
122:31 - million random digits and it has like it
122:34 - says million random digits it has
122:37 - 100,000 normal deviants and I think I've
122:39 - talked in other videos about the origins
122:40 - of this book super interesting story
122:41 - link to purchase your own copy I guess
122:44 - in this video's description not for me
122:47 - but I will who I would love to have a
122:49 - book just like this that is a million a
122:52 - billion a lot of digits of pi because
122:54 - then I could read it quietly to my
122:56 - children at nighttime when it's bedtime
122:58 - because they're all tired of the random
123:00 - numbers so I would like to make this
123:02 - book and then hopefully I'm gonna make a
123:05 - really poorly design not very thoughtful
123:07 - version of it you're gonna watch this
123:09 - video and you're gonna make your own
123:10 - view more beautiful version of it maybe
123:12 - it will print them well there'll be a
123:14 - limited edition coding training book of
123:16 - Pi I have no idea I don't know what's
123:18 - gonna come of this but I'm gonna do this
123:19 - in processing now processing is a Java
123:23 - based programming environment for it
123:26 - works with graphics as animation to do
123:28 - and it's from the processing foundation
123:30 - link all sorts of links about more of
123:32 - that in this video's description but one
123:35 - of the reasons why I want to use it is
123:36 - it has a wonderful PDF export library so
123:40 - it allows me to draw and arbitrarily
123:42 - draw anything and export it out as a PDF
123:45 - so it can be brought into Adobe
123:47 - Illustrator or it can be I'm so glad
123:51 - that the camera went off right then
123:54 - because I really don't want to buzz
123:55 - market Adobe Illustrator by accident
123:57 - code rate not sponsored by Adobe
124:00 - I mean you vote Adobe I'm right here any
124:03 - time for a sponsor sponsor the coding
124:05 - trade go for it okay a PDF file which is
124:17 - ok I don't know what I'll say I'll just
124:18 - sort me go back to you can export a PDF
124:21 - file which is a vector file that you
124:22 - could you could turn into a and print as
124:25 - a giant poster or make it to a book
124:26 - look enlarge it bring it to another
124:29 - program that accepts SVG's or PDF files
124:33 - and manipulate it so let's get started
124:36 - with this and that's actually what I'm
124:37 - going to do so what I want to do just to
124:39 - start is I want to get this example so
124:44 - there are two ways to render PDFs in
124:46 - processing one is a way where you don't
124:47 - actually see any preview of it just
124:49 - renders the PDF directly and another is
124:51 - a way to see a preview and I kind of
124:53 - want to see the preview so the first
124:56 - thing I'm gonna do is say import
124:57 - processing PDF and by the way this
125:00 - program already has the code to load 1
125:04 - million digits of pi into a variable
125:06 - excuse me and I will include with this
125:09 - video and this code links to a file that
125:11 - has 10 million digits and a file that
125:14 - has let me just go look this up
125:18 - 1 billion ok and a file that has 1
125:24 - billion digits so if you want to go even
125:28 - crazier than I'm gonna go in this video
125:30 - you can check out those files as well ok
125:31 - so now I have those just to make sure
125:34 - it's working let me say print line PI
125:35 - dot length length being a function of
125:38 - the string class in Java and I can see
125:40 - there's 1 million digits here and if I
125:42 - go look just look in the data oops
125:45 - we can see I was already testing this we
125:48 - can see there's the 1 million digits
125:49 - okay so it's there okay so let me grow
125:53 - and grep so I imported the PDF library
125:55 - now I want to get begin record I'm just
125:59 - gonna then I'm gonna say background 255
126:02 - I'm gonna draw a line I'm gonna say
126:04 - stroke actually let's put some text in
126:06 - here because we're gonna need to do text
126:07 - I'm gonna say fill 0 text hello and then
126:14 - I'll put this it's some arbitrary
126:16 - location oh I guess I before 200 200 and
126:21 - then also just so you can see I could
126:22 - say like ellipse you know 40 40 20 30 so
126:27 - let's run this then I'm gonna say end
126:28 - record and there we go so we can see my
126:34 - preview here I've got some text I've got
126:36 - a nice little circle and then if I
126:40 - look in the sketch folder there's a file
126:42 - called filename not PDF I can open that
126:44 - up and you can see here's my PDF and we
126:47 - can be sure that this is not bitmapped
126:49 - pixel images because I can zoom way into
126:52 - it I can blow it up to any size and so
126:54 - this is something that I could now
126:55 - choose to go in print and there this is
126:57 - what I would print so let's make a PDF
126:59 - would it be exciting if I could make one
127:02 - poster that has every digit of pie or my
127:04 - previous visualization example maybe you
127:07 - want to render a poster with some
127:09 - visualization you could also do that in
127:11 - in processing okay so let me try to
127:15 - figure out how can I fit a bunch of
127:16 - digits on to the page so one thing I
127:20 - want to do is let's create let's add a
127:23 - font P font F I know it doesn't actually
127:27 - need to be a global variable because I'm
127:28 - doing everything and setup I'm just say
127:30 - create font I'm gonna use courier which
127:32 - is a fixed-width font meaning every
127:35 - letter and every digit is the same width
127:36 - it's gonna make my math easier I think
127:39 - as I go let's make it 16 point then I'm
127:42 - gonna say a text font F to set that font
127:49 - and let's say text now let me just do
127:53 - the first ten digits of pi pi and I so
127:56 - the way I can do that is with substring
127:58 - substring 0 comma 10 this is a function
128:01 - that's gonna say hey that string of 1
128:03 - million digits give me the first 10 and
128:06 - let me render those at pixel location
128:09 - 200 200 okay and by the way what it
128:13 - doesn't this text file doesn't have the
128:14 - three dot in it so let me also add three
128:17 - point because it starts with one four
128:18 - one five nine okay let me get rid of
128:20 - this look ellipse and one thing that I
128:24 - can do just to kind of as I'm working on
128:25 - this and so let's call this also let's
128:28 - call this file book of Pi and let's run
128:34 - this program and now let's open up that
128:38 - file and we can see there it is I have
128:44 - the digits of pi in a PDF oh boy and
128:47 - this is like well it should be
128:49 - selectable text but oh
128:53 - now let's think about this further what
128:56 - do I want to do next let's put it at
128:59 - zero zero and see what happens I should
129:03 - be able to go here and have it update
129:05 - okay whoops
129:07 - isn't it update do I really have to open
129:12 - it again in preview okay I don't see
129:17 - that anymore so one of the reasons why I
129:19 - don't see it anymore is zero zero for
129:21 - text is right off the top there so how
129:24 - big is that courier font maybe the line
129:26 - height is also 16 points so let me say
129:30 - let me put it at zero comma 16 and there
129:38 - we go I got to update and I can see
129:40 - there it is there is the text it's
129:44 - appearing there now let me make this
129:45 - kind of landscape size of an eight and a
129:49 - half by 11 so this would be the
129:51 - equivalent of an eight and a half by 11
129:52 - piece of paper because it's 1150 pixels
129:54 - wide 850 pixels high this is one way to
129:57 - do it I think and let me run this again
130:07 - come on show it to me
130:09 - there it is view zoom zoom to fit Oh
130:14 - command 9 there we go so there we go
130:17 - there's my book now as a PDF so now
130:21 - let's get some more digits now we should
130:23 - be able to calculate what is the width
130:26 - of each one of these what is the width
130:28 - of each one of these characters so one
130:31 - thing I can actually do for chuckle II
130:33 - for me is I can use a processing as a
130:37 - text width function and I'll just ask
130:40 - for what is the width in pixels of a
130:44 - space and this is why using a fixed
130:45 - width font because everything will be
130:47 - the same so let me look at that so it is
130:52 - exactly nine point six zero one five six
130:55 - two five you know approximately pixels
130:57 - so I should be able to fit on the page
131:01 - so I should be able to calculate this
131:04 - right so the width of each
131:07 - pixal is text with space the height I'm
131:10 - just arbitrarily saying the line height
131:12 - is 16 so the area is width times height
131:21 - so how many of and the area that's and
131:26 - so the area of the area of the area of
131:29 - the of a single character is width times
131:33 - height the area of the entire page is
131:36 - width times height in pixels so I should
131:41 - be able the total number of characters I
131:43 - should be able fight on that page is the
131:45 - area of the entire page divided by the
131:48 - area of each character and I'm gonna
131:52 - convert that to an integer and not worry
131:55 - about rounding issues and then I should
131:58 - be able to say give me all those
132:00 - characters on one page hey it finished
132:06 - and look but here's the thing there are
132:08 - no line breaks right so one of the nice
132:10 - things about processing it will actually
132:11 - fit all the text into a box so what I
132:14 - can add here I want to add is and and
132:18 - the point of this by the way is for me
132:19 - not to have to look at the PDF because I
132:21 - have this preview here so I can actually
132:22 - just add into my text function two more
132:29 - arguments with comma height and let's
132:31 - see what we get okay that's pretty good
132:36 - now why did it looks like it's yay all
132:40 - right why is it it's a little bit down
132:43 - the line height I sort of feel like I
132:45 - kind of want to squeeze stuff in yeah
132:51 - there's a really good question being
132:53 - asked in the chat stn asked I don't
132:56 - really get why using processing for this
132:58 - open the 1 million digits file in a text
133:00 - editor and export to PDF done this is an
133:05 - excellent point the reason why I'm doing
133:08 - this is because my point of this is you
133:12 - could now think of a more creative way
133:14 - what if you wanted to give each one of
133:16 - these characters a different color a
133:18 - different size we wanted to make a
133:19 - spiral pattern
133:20 - you wanted to draw a rectangle based on
133:23 - color think of the visualization stuff
133:24 - that I did so I just want this to be a
133:26 - foundation for building something I also
133:28 - just want to explore PDF rendering and
133:30 - processing to render a book is that even
133:32 - possible I actually never tried to do
133:34 - this before so so I'm gonna try using a
133:40 - line height of 12 let's see how that
133:42 - looks and that's better and I'm down
133:47 - aligned by accident which is probably
133:51 - has to do why did that happen
133:52 - and so Oh 16 let's try this so I wonder
133:59 - if now for whatever reason the way that
134:01 - I'm doing this is I can actually now
134:04 - because I want to fit it in the box
134:05 - aha there we go because I want to fit it
134:08 - in the box now the question is did I
134:10 - actually fit all of those characters
134:12 - into this box perfectly now you can see
134:15 - that there's a little bit of spacing
134:17 - there relative to the spacing there I'm
134:19 - not gonna get too hung up about that
134:20 - probably text-align:center left-center
134:24 - maybe I could if I was doing each
134:26 - character individually there might be a
134:28 - way that I could align the text let's
134:29 - try this work if I just do the I think
134:34 - this is only gonna work if I'm cuz I can
134:37 - do a horizontal and vertical alignment
134:46 - yeah that that fixed this top and bottom
134:50 - spacing but the left and right spacing
134:52 - is a little bit off so anyway I could
134:53 - fledge this a little bit like oh let me
134:55 - just like move it over a couple pixels
134:56 - like six pixels maybe or I could do it
135:01 - relative to the center the that's too
135:03 - many pixels but I'm not gonna get too
135:06 - hung up on that the point of the design
135:08 - aspect of this oh now now actually I'm
135:10 - feeling better about this so the design
135:12 - aspect so here's the question let's look
135:15 - at the PDF there we go
135:16 - did I really get all 1000 all the pixels
135:22 - that sorry is is this really did I get
135:25 - the full substring in on that page so
135:28 - let me say let me let me check some
135:31 - stuff print line total and then
135:34 - print line pie dots up let me look at
135:38 - this substring so if we look in the
135:44 - console at that substring we can sort of
135:47 - this is like the worst way to look at it
135:49 - we can see this is where it ends it ends
135:52 - with nine zero six six one mmm oh boy so
136:00 - something went wrong here let me let me
136:08 - copy paste this into a text file just to
136:13 - be sure so something about my math is
136:20 - off nine eight six six
136:24 - so let's sorry what I'm seeing in the
136:28 - window here let's let's check the PDF to
136:30 - be sure oh look at this the PDF is
136:32 - slightly different five four seven seven
136:36 - nine one five four seven seven nine one
136:42 - who only got about half of it so am i
136:46 - off by a factor of two I assumed the
136:50 - height so where did I get this wrong
137:01 - oh I this is wrong height 12
137:08 - I forgot that I assumed I need to oh I'm
137:11 - so silly
137:11 - so I assumed the height I calculated the
137:14 - width of the character but I just
137:15 - figured let me make up some height so
137:17 - actually the way to get the height is
137:19 - text ascent which is the highest point
137:22 - of a character there's no text height
137:25 - function - text descent I think let me
137:29 - print that out and see what we get
137:31 - of course that's wrong okay let me print
137:35 - that out and I don't want to I don't
137:38 - want to see this anymore
137:42 - 9 oh yeah 9 so now we can see 9 8 6 6 -
137:48 - it's the same amount that's on the page
137:50 - so let me print line this I do have to
137:56 - print that out and see where does this
137:59 - end it's many fewer digits ah my math is
138:06 - off wait no no oh boy
138:14 - Center center 301 ah this book I thought
138:18 - that insect was crawling in me 16 pixel
138:21 - plus space isn't there one digit missing
138:25 - the dot doesn't count the dot counts as
138:27 - a digit so hold on let me clear the
138:38 - printing to the console sort off all
138:40 - right let me try this again printing to
138:42 - the console and let me grab this
138:48 - maybe I'm let me look here whoa 6 3 1 2
138:56 - 7 and that doesn't look like what's
139:00 - there could actually fit more it thinks
139:08 - it can fit more stuff not less hold on
139:12 - let me think about this what have I
139:13 - gotten wrong
139:23 - I'm not actually fitting it into the
139:25 - entire the line is line spacing no line
139:30 - spacing I assume okay so I also need the
139:33 - line spacing how can I get that how do I
139:37 - get the line spacing what is the default
139:49 - so what would the default line spacing
139:52 - be I mean I could have just done this
139:54 - now manually like I could do the line
139:56 - spacing manually without using the box
139:58 - the default mean I could just do trial
140:01 - and error here so this doesn't work
140:02 - because this is not the this is actually
140:05 - like the height of the character but
140:06 - there's line spacing in there is there a
140:10 - function in processing
140:21 - on for under text typography but whoops
140:32 - text letting maybe text letting oh it
140:40 - sets it okay
140:46 - text letting 10 that's 10 20 that's 20
140:51 - ha okay okay we've set for the default
140:57 - if text size 48 is run low okay okay so
141:02 - I wonder if I could get the current text
141:04 - letting letting not letting yeah okay
141:15 - text letting alright okay so that
141:21 - clearly did text ascent - text descent
141:24 - doesn't work either because that's just
141:26 - the raw height of the letter itself
141:29 - there's also line spacing in here and
141:31 - another way to refer to the line spacing
141:33 - is letting so I think actually what I
141:35 - might like to do is manually I mean one
141:37 - thing I could do is just manually set
141:39 - all the lines myself but I think I can
141:41 - make this work like for example if I say
141:43 - text letting 10 right before I draw the
141:50 - text if I set the text letting let's
141:52 - actually make it 24 and run this you can
141:57 - see you can see that these are farther
141:59 - apart from each other so if I set it to
142:02 - 12 they're like right on top of each
142:08 - other which is kind of interesting but
142:10 - doesn't really look right so I think
142:12 - probably it probably was like 14 or 16
142:15 - is what I'm guessing the default was for
142:18 - twelve point fourteen doesn't look
142:23 - exactly right either
142:24 - let's try 16 there's probably a formula
142:29 - for what the default letting is this
142:30 - looks pretty reasonable so let's go with
142:33 - 16 so now I think this is gonna work if
142:36 - I make a very of I say H equals 16 and
142:41 - then I set the text letting to H now
142:46 - what I'm going to do let me run this one
142:49 - more try here okay so it looks like it
142:55 - really really they've squeezed all the
142:57 - way in there to the bottom the last
142:58 - digit is 6:01 let's look down in the
143:01 - console here let me try to copy/paste
143:04 - what it what it thinks that should fit
143:06 - on that page and let's hope we're right
143:11 - 6:01 oh there's a lot of six zero ones
143:14 - I'm getting closer I feel like let's see
143:17 - was it at least seven four five one nine
143:19 - six zero one I think I might have to do
143:22 - the lines myself seven four five one
143:26 - nine six zero one so what did I get
143:29 - well I got so much closer what did I get
143:32 - wrong
143:45 - what did I get wrong so the question is
143:51 - alright let's just okay so one thing I
143:53 - want to figure out is look right
143:58 - alright this is turned into a bit more
144:01 - ridiculous than I had thought it was
144:03 - gonna be I probably should have tried
144:04 - this in advance which is maybe a blanket
144:06 - statement for everything I do but let's
144:09 - try to just fit everything in one line
144:11 - and let's see if we can get that let's
144:13 - actually forget about the whole box
144:14 - thing for a second let's just think
144:17 - about one line the text width of a space
144:20 - and so I'm gonna make things simpler
144:24 - here and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say the
144:27 - total is and I guess there's a rounding
144:29 - error here but now that shouldn't matter
144:31 - so much width divided by W so I'm gonna
144:34 - not worry about height and total then
144:39 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
144:40 - these out take out the bounding box and
144:44 - I'm gonna forget about letting I'm gonna
144:48 - still I'm gonna put 0 here and I do need
144:51 - I gotta shift it down like 16 points
144:54 - okay total equals why is this unexpected
144:58 - token int I don't see anything wrong
145:03 - with what I've written here o equals I
145:05 - need an equal sign there okay let's try
145:06 - this let's see if we can fit it on one
145:08 - line okay so one line it fit all the way
145:13 - to three zero six and what it should
145:17 - have fit okay so I did that correctly my
145:19 - width calculation is correct so I could
145:23 - just do this in a loop so let's make
145:24 - this happen in a loop so what I'm gonna
145:30 - do and let's get rid of a it's something
145:33 - to be more to do this character by
145:34 - character because then I could do
145:35 - interesting things with colors really
145:36 - what I wanted to do but this video is
145:38 - already taking way too long because we
145:40 - could make a book of just every digit
145:42 - map to a color I think that would be
145:43 - exciting let me get rid of this
145:45 - text-align:left Center thing for a
145:46 - second just to see what's going on okay
145:49 - so that's good it fit perfect so now
145:53 - what I want to do you know what
145:58 - let's just go character by character by
146:00 - golly if we're gonna do it line by line
146:02 - let's go character by character because
146:04 - we want to have that ability to make the
146:06 - sort of magic that we want to make so
146:08 - what I'm going to actually do is I'm
146:11 - going to say I'm gonna start with I'm
146:16 - gonna start with an X I'm gonna start
146:21 - with a why I'm going to say for I'm
146:29 - actually use a while loop while X is
146:31 - less than with X plus equals W if X if X
146:41 - is greater than or equal to with minus W
146:47 - just greater than if it doesn't fit the
146:49 - full letter doesn't fit on let's let's
146:55 - set we're going to go Y plus equal
146:57 - height and X is going to get set back to
147:00 - zero
147:00 - so I'm gonna do this is totally insane
147:04 - what I'm doing now and then I'm gonna
147:08 - say text X comma Y and let me just say H
147:12 - now one thing I'm gonna do to speed
147:13 - things up for a little bit is I'm going
147:14 - to take out the begin record and end
147:17 - record I don't want to deal with the PDF
147:18 - right now I just want to see what this
147:19 - looks like do I not have an H so I need
147:22 - an H which I'm going to make up as 16 oh
147:26 - boy I don't have any oh I don't know if
147:32 - this is never going to stop while X oh
147:36 - and this should be whoa if what if X is
147:40 - then Y goes back to 0 and then I need to
147:43 - break out of this if Y is greater than
147:46 - height minus H break or continue mmm am
147:56 - i stuck in an infinite loop here whoops
148:00 - what happened there we went across this
148:04 - should be X
148:09 - why goes up X goes back to zero just
148:16 - think about this what am I seeing here
148:28 - I'm still seeing oh boy I have all this
148:31 - nonsense
148:40 - oh hi pause for a second the wild
148:44 - condition yep what yeah yeah I've gone
148:53 - totally insane
148:55 - scratch all this Matt yeah rewind rewind
149:01 - why am i doing it this way this is like
149:04 - this is the like I'm at two hours here
149:06 - and I'm like panicking
149:11 - alright I'm actually gonna start with
149:13 - just a loop a nested loop right isn't
149:16 - that insane let's just have let's have Y
149:19 - be the outer loop Y is all closed all
149:22 - the way up to height Y plus equals H so
149:25 - I'm gonna have an H of H of 16 and a
149:28 - width of whatever sort of text width is
149:29 - then I'm gonna have an X X is less than
149:34 - height and X goes up by this then what
149:39 - I'm going to do is just for the sake of
149:40 - argument let me just draw a rectangle
149:42 - and XY with the width and a height so
149:46 - this should wrist represents the box of
149:48 - the letter and I'm gonna say I should
149:53 - start this whole challenge over I really
149:56 - really should I really should just
149:58 - please start this whole challenge over I
150:02 - think I better start it over because I
150:05 - don't even want to like deal with the
150:06 - PDF until I've worked this out it makes
150:09 - so much more sense to not do the PDF
150:11 - thing and to do it this way all right
150:15 - [Music]
150:17 - hold on coding training stopping at the
150:21 - station it's going backing up we're
150:23 - gonna take a momentary break here to
150:25 - Center ourselves we're gonna read some
150:28 - digits of pi oh the digits of pi aren't
150:30 - there anymore
150:35 - nine one nine two seven eight one nine
150:41 - one one nine seven nine three nine nine
150:45 - five two zero six one four one etc etc
150:52 - no I'm going to use X in the loop and
150:55 - then keep a separate index for counting
150:59 - through the digits of pi get PI at X Y I
151:06 - thought I would just use a separate
151:08 - index value no I get some interesting
151:14 - discussion between what if I should use
151:16 - an int in the loop but the way I was
151:18 - thinking about is I just want my loop to
151:19 - keep track of the grid and then I'll
151:25 - have a separate index counter that's
151:27 - just walking through and giving me the
151:29 - next digit of pi don't you think that
151:31 - sounds like a perfectly sound idea two
151:38 - mistakes in the code second loop well
151:39 - I'm starting totally over anyway
151:49 - yeah
151:53 - I could do the grid because all right
151:55 - the grid positions could be the reason
151:58 - why their floats is because this text
152:01 - width is not going to actually come out
152:02 - to a an integer but certainly it would
152:08 - make more sense but I'm very I'm very uh
152:15 - okay okay I'm gonna do it my way you are
152:24 - all gonna make a much better version of
152:25 - this just calculate the count for X and
152:28 - the count for y yes yes yes yes yes no I
152:32 - know I could do that but then I have to
152:33 - multiply it out I don't want to do it
152:36 - that way you don't want to do it that
152:37 - way all right we're starting over this
152:42 - is why I make these videos so I can do
152:44 - it in a silly way that you watch and say
152:46 - that's ridiculous
152:47 - I'm gonna learn something I'm gonna I'm
152:49 - gonna do it my own way and you will
152:50 - learn something in that process all
152:58 - right I need a break
153:01 - no I could write it so here's the thing
153:03 - the reason why I want to do them one at
153:05 - a time is I want this to be an example
153:07 - that people could render each character
153:11 - individually with its own fill stroke
153:13 - they could draw you know actually what
153:15 - kayak I want to do is draw a polygon
153:17 - there well I like this idea instead of
153:19 - rendering the numbers I could draw a
153:21 - polygon so if the digit is 0
153:24 - I draw nothing if it's 1 I draw a line
153:27 - no a point if it's 2 I draw a line 3 I
153:31 - draw a triangle for I draw a square I'm
153:41 - like for a gone what's 4 Greek for for a
153:44 - square 5 a five-sided things 6 a hexagon
153:49 - I need anything I need a break I need to
153:52 - get some water all right please bear
153:58 - with me
154:02 - so also in the chats I was telling me
154:04 - the letting should be a hundred twenty
154:06 - percent of the point size of the font so
154:09 - that makes sense
154:11 - Pentagon right Pentagon Pentagon right
154:17 - this is why I need a short break I'm
154:18 - going to take a pause I'm gonna get some
154:20 - I'm gonna fill this up with some water
154:21 - this is a your waiting music will now be
154:25 - on use my microphone the music is
154:54 - glitchy again you know this happens all
154:58 - right you forget about the whole music I
155:00 - dunno how to fix this it's it's like a
155:03 - it's like a wires crossed thing I
155:06 - figured out it's like interference from
155:10 - some of these different cables
155:18 - I think I fixed it right somebody tell
155:33 - me it's fixed up all right you will
155:45 - have to sit in silence I'm not going to
155:47 - worry about fixing the music right now I
155:48 - will be back I forgot that I muted my
156:13 - microphone actually I think I'm gonna go
156:15 - make myself a coffee I had tea earlier
156:18 - and I think if I'm gonna do this
156:19 - actually you know what I'm gonna do this
156:22 - is gonna be very annoying to all of you
156:24 - I you can hear me now I think what I'm
156:26 - gonna do is 140 I'm gonna take a break
156:29 - for an hour and come back because I
156:32 - would like to do this coding challenge I
156:34 - think it'll be interesting and so then I
156:38 - can grab a quick we may be able to only
156:40 - be a half an hour like I'm gonna go
156:41 - downstairs I'm gonna make a coffee I
156:43 - have a sandwich that I made and actually
156:44 - make it I bought left downstairs for
156:47 - myself so let me go and just take a half
156:50 - an hour break or so and then I will make
156:53 - myself a coffee have a little sandwich
156:55 - my mind will clear so that I remember
156:56 - what a square is and I will come back
157:01 - I'm sorry everybody I know some of you
157:03 - are in but it doesn't you know half an
157:05 - hour doesn't help so and then and I will
157:11 - be back so I will be back in
157:12 - approximately certainly within an hour
157:14 - by 240 but hopefully sooner than that
157:20 - all right okay everybody if you want to
157:25 - I can try to upload the code I made from
157:28 - this morning I'm not going to worry
157:29 - about that I will see you all very soon
157:31 - I will be back thank you for watching
