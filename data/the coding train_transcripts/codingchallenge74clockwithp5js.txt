00:00 - tick tock tick tock goes the clock
00:03 - anyway this is a coding challenge where
00:05 - I am going to make a very simple very
00:07 - basic clock in p5 GS why am i doing this
00:10 - well if you are beginning to learn about
00:12 - programming and learn about graphics and
00:14 - animation a great exercise that you can
00:16 - do that can really even really express
00:18 - your creativity with is invent a new way
00:21 - of showing time make make a clock and
00:25 - whatever imaginative crazy way has never
00:28 - been done before and it's really easy to
00:30 - get the time information with p5.js and
00:33 - then it's just up to you to figure out
00:35 - what to draw based on that time
00:36 - information now the inspiration for this
00:38 - idea comes from also very loud squeak
00:41 - John Midas twelve o'clock so John Maeda
00:45 - this is a project from 1996 to 97 made
00:50 - in classic Mac for classic Mac you could
00:54 - see here are examples of John my de 12
00:59 - clocks and these were this this
01:02 - documentation page was created by Golan
01:05 - Levin who as for his course at Carnegie
01:08 - Mellon University oh that's from last
01:11 - year maybe has an assignment which is to
01:17 - create your own clock and so here's an
01:19 - example clock made in p5.js a template
01:22 - and you can see this is what I'm talking
01:23 - I would like to do something like this
01:25 - which just shows you the mechanics of
01:27 - how you get the hour the minute the
01:29 - second and draw something based on those
01:31 - and temp template that you could use and
01:34 - I hope that making this video will
01:36 - inspire a world of so many clocks that I
01:39 - could never possibly imagine and I can't
01:41 - wait to see all the clocks that people
01:42 - are going to make after watching this
01:43 - video and I will try to come back and
01:45 - make more ah I want to if you're looking
01:46 - for more inspiration I gotta get to
01:48 - making the clock this is a collection of
01:50 - clocks made by alka loyal viewer of the
01:54 - coding train and there's some wonderful
01:55 - ones this is one of my this is a really
01:56 - nice one the particle clock will just
01:58 - look at this where we can see like a
02:00 - look at this these are the particles so
02:01 - this is actually having particles fly
02:03 - around and end up and use it with the
02:06 - actual numbers of the time I'm gonna try
02:08 - to draw something based on time
02:10 - okay I now have some empty code and I am
02:13 - ready to start programming the clock so
02:15 - there's two things I want to talk about
02:16 - before I start writing some code number
02:18 - one is how do I get the time information
02:20 - so this is actually one of the things
02:21 - that p5 does for you I mean it's just
02:23 - wrapping native javascript file
02:25 - functions that are part of the browser
02:27 - for getting the current time based on
02:29 - your computer's clock and if I go to the
02:33 - p5 reference we can see those under time
02:35 - and date so I can get the day the hour
02:38 - the minute the month the second and the
02:40 - year I'm just gonna use our minute I'm
02:44 - just going to use and second okay no
02:46 - three hour minute and second Millie's is
02:49 - a function that gives you the number of
02:51 - milliseconds that have passed since the
02:53 - sketch started and this could be used
02:55 - for timers and keeping track of things
02:57 - and thinking in animation to a clock and
02:59 - it's interesting and useful but I'm
03:00 - gonna actually just pull and I'm not
03:02 - gonna do like you know fractions of a
03:04 - second I'm just gonna pull hour minute
03:07 - and second from from p5 so let's
03:09 - actually really quickly just like spin
03:12 - up a digital clock so I'm gonna say let
03:15 - our equal hours let minute equal minutes
03:21 - I think this is right
03:23 - let second equal seconds for those the
03:27 - name of the functions hour minute second
03:30 - boy this is so this is a terrible idea
03:32 - that I just did hour minute second I'm
03:36 - gonna call this HR for owl MN for a
03:39 - minute and SC for second I really should
03:41 - come up with better variable names than
03:43 - that that's what I'm gonna do right now
03:44 - and what I'm going to do next is I'm
03:47 - just gonna say fill 255 no stroke and
03:50 - then I'm gonna say text hour
03:54 - + : + minute + : + second and I'm gonna
04:05 - put that at 10 comma 200 so let's see if
04:08 - this works we have a really quickly
04:10 - there we go we have our clock right it
04:14 - is now six oh eight and 28 29 30 seconds
04:22 - is that the right time oh my god
04:24 - I'm so late that's why I'm gonna keep
04:26 - going with this cutting jobs and I'll
04:27 - leave when I'm done this is good
04:30 - actually to do it when I'm supposed to
04:31 - be somewhere that I have the coding
04:32 - challenge to be the time so there's no
04:35 - zero there so I need to think about
04:36 - number formatting and you know there's
04:39 - all sorts of interesting things I could
04:40 - do for designing making a digital clock
04:42 - I believe in all the creative ideas to
04:44 - you but what I want to do is visualize
04:45 - the time so I think my idea to do
04:48 - something rather simple but it's a
04:49 - little bit more interesting than just
04:51 - bars is I'm gonna use arcs so this is
04:55 - what the ellipse function does in p5 the
04:58 - ellipse function draws an ellipse or a
05:00 - circle at a given X Y according to some
05:03 - width and according to some height and
05:05 - the width and height could be the same
05:07 - because you get to get that just as a
05:08 - diameter if it's a perfect circle so I'm
05:10 - actually just going to have an ellipse
05:11 - and an XY with a particular diameter
05:14 - okay what the arc function does is
05:19 - exactly the same thing it draws an
05:22 - ellipse at a given X Y with a given
05:25 - diameter however in addition to the X Y
05:30 - the diameter width and height I can give
05:34 - a start angle and an end angle meaning I
05:38 - can say draw this arc from 0 to 180
05:42 - degrees so I'll only see this part of
05:46 - the of the circle so let's see how that
05:48 - works and let's try to draw just to see
05:53 - this in action I'm gonna get rid of the
05:55 - text now I don't need that anymore I can
05:57 - use that for debugging I'm gonna draw an
05:59 - ellipse at 200 200 I'm gonna say stroke
06:03 - wait for no fill and I'm going to give
06:08 - it a diameter of let's just say 200
06:12 - right now let's yeah no let's say 300
06:15 - and let's take a look at that oh and I
06:20 - need to say stroke 255 so there's my
06:24 - ellipse right that's the full lips now
06:27 - what I want to do is I want to draw an
06:29 - arc so I'm gonna say stroke and I'm
06:33 - gonna give it some arbitrary color
06:37 - and I'm gonna say Ark and I'm gonna give
06:40 - it exactly these same values and I'm
06:43 - going to say zero to 360 zero to 360
06:49 - which means draw the whole thing the
06:51 - full circle from zero all the way three
06:53 - or six degrees the problem is I want to
06:55 - think of degrees here I've talked in
06:57 - other videos about degrees versus
06:59 - radians a different unit of measurements
07:01 - it's an interesting topic but it's
07:02 - easier for me right now I think to just
07:04 - say angle mode degrees so that the unit
07:06 - of measurement that I'm using in the arc
07:08 - function is degrees and if I run this we
07:10 - see the circle turn pink but it didn't
07:12 - actually turn pink right if I make the
07:15 - stroke weight of this eight whoops oh
07:21 - and the stroke weight of this 1/4 we can
07:27 - see the pink arc inside of the white one
07:30 - and I could say with the arc like let me
07:33 - only have 180 degrees half of that and
07:35 - you can see that it's drawing that
07:37 - inside though it's drawing that inside
07:40 - only 180 degrees and what I could do is
07:42 - I could say let end equal to map the
07:46 - mouse X location which goes between 0
07:48 - and width between 0 and 360 degrees and
07:51 - I could say end here so you can see as I
07:55 - move the mouse and this is a little I'm
07:58 - gonna I want to do this the and kind of
08:01 - like the other way around actually I
08:03 - don't this is a little bit weird this
08:08 - makes it so what I'm doing I'm gonna get
08:10 - rid of that one right you can see this
08:14 - is me drawing that full arc so going
08:18 - from 0 all the way to 360 degrees and by
08:21 - the way there are varying ways I can
08:23 - fill in the arc like I'm at this point I
08:25 - probably just want to say no fill and
08:29 - it's just gonna do this but if I wanted
08:31 - to keep that fill there I could say pi
08:36 - which is like filling it like a pie
08:38 - chart right you can see that I can say
08:41 - open which is filling it like this not
08:45 - as a pipe it straight across without
08:47 - connecting this
08:48 - or I can actually say cord which is
08:51 - filling it like open but by connecting
08:54 - the stroke so that's a small detail but
08:55 - it's interesting to see how that works
08:56 - with arc kind of useful I don't care
08:59 - about any of that because I want to say
09:00 - no Phil so what I want to do now is
09:05 - instead of instead of just mapping this
09:09 - arcs location to the mouse I want to say
09:13 - map the number of seconds which goes
09:17 - between 0 and 60 to between 0 and 360
09:20 - and look at that there's my clock with
09:23 - the number of seconds now I want to let
09:28 - me do the same thing again and 1 and 2
09:34 - and I could be more thoughtful about
09:36 - this let me map the number of minutes
09:38 - that also goes between 0 and 360 but I'm
09:42 - gonna have it be you know 280 so a
09:47 - little smaller and n2 so there's the
09:52 - number of minutes right and as soon as
09:55 - seconds gets all the way to 60 this
09:58 - should go one more come on get to 60
10:01 - here we go there we go minutes went up
10:03 - by one and now I'm gonna do the very
10:05 - last one and three between four hour an
10:13 - hour goes from zero to 24 and I could
10:20 - give some different colors here too also
10:21 - you know again I'm not being very
10:23 - thoughtful about the design that's what
10:28 - I'm hoping you who are watching this
10:30 - video for much more creative than me but
10:33 - I can now see and I actually want this
10:35 - one to be instead of 280 let's say 260
10:39 - and now we can see I have the number of
10:44 - seconds the number of minutes and then
10:48 - the hour but this isn't right right
10:50 - because what if what if I want these to
10:52 - actually point to where the the you know
10:56 - what's right what's wrong the point is
10:58 - to make a kind of creative clock that
10:59 - you wouldn't normally imagine see
11:01 - but what I what I would like to do here
11:07 - however is actually have these position
11:09 - in the correct place in the sense of
11:12 - like if it were three o'clock the ark
11:14 - would go from the top all the way to
11:15 - there so let's think about the time the
11:17 - time that I'm recording this right now
11:18 - is approximately 6:15 p.m. so the hours
11:22 - should go all the way to the bottom and
11:27 - so the hours six o'clock oh no but it's
11:31 - 24-hour clock oh it's a 24-hour clock
11:34 - let me just do that it's in the seconds
11:36 - and I'll think about no I can do it I
11:38 - could do it let's do it let's do it so
11:40 - what thing I could do is say actually
11:41 - the hours don't go between 0 and 24 they
11:44 - go between 0 and 12 and I just say
11:46 - modulus 12th so it'll restart once it
11:52 - gets to 12 and 13 will become one
11:54 - o'clock again so that we can see now
11:57 - this is being the hours but it's off
11:58 - what I really want to do is have that
12:01 - range not go from 0 to 360 but I want to
12:04 - start at negative 90 degrees right so
12:07 - this is confusing because rotation
12:10 - happens counterclockwise so if this is
12:12 - zero degrees I want to start up here at
12:15 - negative 90 or I could also think of
12:18 - that as 270 right and I want to go from
12:22 - that all the way to itself so me I am so
12:29 - me in the chat just said well why don't
12:30 - instead I could just rotate everything
12:32 - something interesting actually about in
12:34 - p5 is zero degrees when you when you put
12:37 - the end at zero it actually will draw
12:39 - you the entire thing and it's sort of
12:40 - debatable whether that's a good or bad
12:41 - idea
12:42 - but mostly it confuses people if it
12:44 - doesn't do that so that's why it does
12:45 - that in p5 but let's come back here so
12:47 - there's a couple things I can do number
12:48 - one is I could just translate to the
12:52 - center so I could use I have a whole
12:54 - video now about transformations that you
12:56 - could watch so I could just translate to
12:58 - 200 200 and I could draw all these at
13:01 - 0-0 so this I think will be a nice or
13:05 - easier way to deal with this and I can
13:08 - then just say rotate I think negative 90
13:16 - so there we go
13:17 - so now we can see I'm coming up on
13:20 - finishing 60 seconds and here we go and
13:25 - it starts over again now but I and you
13:28 - can see so now it is sit fought that's
13:31 - not six the green should be at six oh
13:34 - you know why so somebody else Maxwell in
13:38 - the chat is telling me 0 to 59 so this
13:40 - is a problem I did which the mapping
13:43 - should actually be right from 0 to 59
13:46 - minutes seconds 0 to 59 minutes and then
13:51 - 0 to right because we don't get 12 we
13:57 - get 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and then
14:01 - 12 again so 0 to 11 and this shouldn't
14:04 - say oh I also messed this up this
14:05 - shouldn't say right so let me know no 12
14:12 - was right there there we go did I did I
14:15 - get it right with the minutes should be
14:17 - it should be zero 259 12 is fine with
14:21 - the modulus because it's going back to
14:22 - it right let's see duh 0 1
14:25 - oh no so it's kind of hard to think
14:29 - about but it actually should be 0 to 60
14:32 - because 59 seconds does not end at the
14:36 - top it ends a little bit before that's
14:39 - why this should be 0 to 12 and modulus
14:41 - 12 so I did this a few different ways
14:43 - but it is interesting to think about it
14:44 - but these are subtle little points but
14:46 - these should actually be 60 and now
14:49 - we've got the clock so I mean again I'm
14:51 - not suggesting this is a beautiful or
14:54 - interesting or wonderful clock in any
14:56 - way whatsoever what I'm doing is showing
14:58 - you that you can get the time
14:59 - information and you can map it to some
15:01 - kind of design system this is a
15:04 - tried-and-true kind of interesting
15:06 - exercise you can actually do this
15:08 - without knowing a lot about programming
15:10 - if you know just how to draw shapes and
15:12 - how to manipulate numbers that's really
15:13 - all you need for this the second hour
15:15 - and the minute function so this this
15:17 - coding challenge was about to end and I
15:19 - actually just wrapped up but I'm gonna
15:21 - keep going actually cuz there's a lively
15:22 - discussion in the chat let's just sort
15:24 - of I don't know why what I probably
15:26 - should have done is just made
15:27 - a literal clock with minute second and
15:29 - our hands let's do that for a second
15:32 - let's actually put those lines there and
15:34 - see if this kind of maps with what we
15:36 - think it should be so I am going to in
15:39 - addition to drawing these arcs I'm going
15:43 - to draw a line I'm just going to do the
15:47 - second hand for a second from 0 0 to 100
15:52 - comma 0 and I'm gonna give it a stroke
15:55 - of 255 so I'm drawing this line straight
16:01 - up now I want that line to rotate
16:05 - according to that end angle and I'm
16:09 - gonna need to put push and pop around it
16:12 - because that rotation should only affect
16:14 - that line not the arcs so now we can see
16:19 - that is the actual second hand and while
16:22 - I'm letting that run for a little bit
16:24 - I'm going to and I'm just gonna put
16:27 - these at the end I should put this like
16:28 - I should this should be called I'm
16:30 - really second angle oh shoot
16:34 - I just lost my copy paste so I'm gonna
16:39 - do this here so this should be called
16:42 - this should be called second angle if
16:45 - I'm being worrier about this this should
16:47 - be called minute angle and this should
16:52 - be called hour angle if I want to be a
16:57 - bit more thoughtful second angle minute
17:02 - angle and now what I'm going to do is
17:06 - make these lines and I'm gonna do a
17:11 - second angle and I'm going to do a
17:20 - minute angle and hour angle and I'll
17:26 - make the minute 75 and the hour 50 and
17:29 - here we go so again I could be this is
17:32 - right now right it is now well okay I
17:38 - need these to be different colors
17:39 - is that that doesn't look right all
17:43 - right it's the minute angle number of
17:47 - minutes let's make this let's use the
17:50 - same colors I don't know why I put it
17:54 - down there now this is silly of me to
17:56 - separate these things that's the minute
17:59 - angle this is the hour whoops this is
18:07 - the hour color and this is the second
18:11 - color I should draw a point in the
18:14 - middle that would be helpful and then
18:17 - let's also at the end just say stroke
18:20 - 255 point zero zero so there should be a
18:25 - nice little dot in the middle there we
18:27 - go so yeah this is the minute looks
18:33 - wrong zero what did I miss here
18:37 - oh I forgot ah look at this horrible
18:41 - typo I'm staring at it I should never do
18:44 - coding challenges after hours and hours
18:45 - of live streaming this I'm like I'd like
18:47 - three and a half hours of live streaming
18:48 - I just lost the word map there by
18:50 - accident there we go this is our clock
18:54 - oh it makes me happy that is actually
18:57 - kind of a nice looking clock and I don't
18:59 - know why I got distracted by this arc
19:00 - thing if I were to just comment out the
19:02 - arcs just for a second here this is the
19:05 - basic items this is the basic idea of
19:10 - making a clock so I have now made a
19:13 - clock in p5 in JavaScript but the point
19:17 - of me showing you the arc and again it
19:18 - was not very creative is not very
19:19 - exciting that you can now take this
19:21 - basic idea of the code are in reading
19:25 - seconds minutes and hours from the p5
19:29 - functions and drawing to your heart's
19:31 - content the most creative strange way
19:33 - look at the jaw my two clocks look at
19:35 - there's an the lecture by goal on eleven
19:37 - that I will include as a link in this
19:38 - video's description and look at the sum
19:41 - of the clock examples from alka and
19:43 - other users that I'll also link from
19:45 - code pen and hold on so I want to check
19:49 - I don't know if one thing that could be
19:51 - an interesting project is porting all of
19:53 - John might
19:53 - original clocks from the 12 o'clock
19:55 - series if this is a loud thing to do to
19:58 - a p5 GS to like allow those projects to
20:01 - live on and for people to see them in
20:03 - the browser either beautiful and
20:04 - interesting experiments so thanks for
20:07 - everyone for tuning in to this coding
20:08 - challenge I can't wait to see all the
20:10 - clocks that people make I will create a
20:12 - github page where you can submit them
20:14 - and there'll be a link to that in the
20:17 - video's description but you can also
20:19 - tweet me at Schiffman with your clocks
20:22 - or just write them in the comments and
20:24 - I'll see them that way thanks for
20:25 - watching
20:30 - [Music]
