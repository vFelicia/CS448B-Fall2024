00:01 - hi so what I want to look at in this
00:02 - video is two other elements that you can
00:05 - add to a page for additional
00:06 - interactivity so uh the previous video I
00:09 - started talking about this idea of a
00:10 - call back you have a button and you
00:13 - attach a function to that
00:16 - button and the code is executed only
00:19 - when you click on the button via uh the
00:22 - mous Pressed event call back so let's
00:24 - look at two other pieces of of two other
00:26 - interactive elements you can add to the
00:28 - page and how what other events might be
00:30 - associated with those elements and some
00:32 - other things you might be able to do
00:33 - that'll just make things more
00:34 - interesting for you
00:36 - so hopefully I'm not going to like knock
00:39 - this light over and start a fire and
00:41 - there was a siren earlier and you know
00:43 - the fire department will come but
00:45 - everything's okay still for right now
00:46 - okay so the two elements are let's start
00:48 - with a
00:49 - slider so a slider is something that
00:51 - looks like this my beautiful drawing of
00:53 - a slider you can slide this value slide
00:56 - this little dot back and forth and
00:58 - hopefully control something on the page
01:00 - making something larger making something
01:02 - smaller making something more blue less
01:03 - blue how does that work so the P5
01:06 - function for adding a slider to a page
01:09 - this is create
01:12 - slider
01:14 - now there's a few things to mention
01:16 - about this number one this is the
01:20 - default HTML slider element so it's what
01:24 - you get for free in the browser a
01:25 - slider's just there if you want to have
01:28 - your own kind of slider that looks
01:29 - custom if you want to make your slider
01:31 - along a sine wave there's all sorts of
01:33 - crazy things you can do in canvas and
01:34 - drawing and we've sort of seen that but
01:36 - right now we just going to work with the
01:37 - default slider you get for free the
01:39 - other thing I want to mention is you can
01:41 - of course add the slider by writing the
01:44 - HTML tags into the htl source itself and
01:47 - there might be good reasons for doing
01:48 - that but for Simplicity right now I'm
01:50 - kind of focusing on JavaScript and I
01:51 - want to just add the slider using Create
01:53 - slider just like I said create button
01:56 - now what does a slider need a slider
01:59 - needs three three values to start it
02:01 - needs a minimum what is the value that
02:04 - the slider should output when it SL when
02:07 - you slide all the way to the left what
02:10 - is the maximum when you slide all the
02:12 - way to the right and what is what I
02:14 - would say the starting
02:16 - value so let's say that I want to use
02:19 - the slider to control the size of a
02:22 - circle and I want the circle size to be
02:24 - between 10 and 100 and I want it to
02:27 - start at 47 so create slider with a
02:31 - minimum with a maximum and with a
02:35 - starting value so let's add that to the
02:39 - page I'm going to come over here and um
02:42 - we can see I already have a button and
02:44 - now I'm going to add a slider create
02:46 - slider with a minimum a maximum and a
02:51 - starting value so we should see now that
02:54 - there is also a slider on the Page by
02:56 - the way one thing I did which is kind of
02:58 - silly is was bothered me that the button
03:00 - was showing up to the right of the
03:02 - canvas later I will show you all sorts
03:05 - of other ways through CSS and styling to
03:07 - control the layout of the page but right
03:11 - now uh as a quick sort of trick is I
03:14 - just added a parag an empty paragraph
03:16 - between the canvas and the button and
03:18 - you can see how I did that in the code
03:19 - right here so I made the canvas I made
03:22 - an empty paragraph and then I put the
03:24 - button you can see the slider is showing
03:25 - up to the right of the button if I added
03:27 - another empty paragraph it would show up
03:28 - below you know whether it was that's a
03:30 - good idea or a bad idea I'm sure lots of
03:32 - people will tell me that that was a
03:33 - terrible idea but you know what it works
03:35 - it's fine okay so now the slider is
03:38 - there I can move it around nothing is
03:40 - happening but you notice also I could
03:42 - change this like if I say the starting
03:44 - value is five you can see look the
03:46 - slider position started over here if I
03:49 - say the starting value is
03:51 - 86 the
03:53 - slider position starts over here so you
03:56 - can control that starting value by uh
03:59 - changing the number hard-coded in the
04:01 - code so how do you get the value out of
04:04 - the slider and the way that you get the
04:06 - value out of the slider is a function
04:08 - called value so this is another function
04:12 - that we're adding that I'm that that I'm
04:14 - this is another function that I'm
04:15 - telling you about that is part of HTML
04:17 - elements so far we've only seen
04:20 - position which absolute position is an
04:23 - element on the page I've shown you HTML
04:26 - the HTML function which changes the
04:28 - content of the element what's the text
04:29 - in the element and now you're seeing
04:31 - another one value which pulls out the
04:33 - value now value is not necessarily
04:35 - relevant for a lot of other uh for for
04:38 - all elements but s value is relevant for
04:41 - a slider because you need to know the
04:42 - current value of the
04:44 - slider so let's say where where might I
04:47 - use this ah so first of all what did I
04:50 - forget I just made the slider but if I
04:53 - want to pull the value if I want to
04:54 - position it change its content pull out
04:56 - the value I need a variable to call that
04:58 - function on so I need to add a variable
05:01 - slider here then I can say slider equals
05:04 - create slider and now anywhere in the
05:06 - code I could access its value so I want
05:09 - to change this to a
05:11 - circle and you can see there's a circle
05:13 - and I'm going to say slider.
05:17 - value in here in slider. val now you
05:21 - might ask the question is don't I want
05:24 - an event like I want to have an event
05:27 - fire I want to handle the event anytime
05:30 - the user moves the slider and this is
05:32 - something you actually can do and I I'll
05:34 - show that to you hopefully in this video
05:36 - in a little bit later but I've done a
05:37 - little bit of a trick here remember draw
05:39 - this animation Loop is just cycling over
05:42 - and over again draw draw draw loop loop
05:44 - loop so what I can do instead of
05:45 - handling the event I could just say
05:47 - while I'm drawing that Circle every time
05:49 - I draw the circle access the value of
05:52 - the slider for the size of the circle
05:53 - and you can see here now that I move the
05:55 - slider you can see the the size of that
05:58 - circle is changing so this is yet
06:00 - another thing you can add to your code
06:02 - you can have a button here now I have a
06:05 - button that handles an event I have a
06:08 - slider where I'm pulling the value
06:10 - continuously and draw and so I'm
06:12 - essentially building a little interface
06:13 - to control the canvas so this is kind of
06:16 - what I think you can start doing now if
06:18 - you've learned a bit about programming
06:20 - and you're making these little pictures
06:21 - the animations what might you get out of
06:23 - building a simple interface controlling
06:25 - things in the code with a button
06:26 - controlling things in the code with a
06:28 - slider and even more so let's look at
06:30 - one more
06:32 - element a text input
06:36 - field and this is where I'm going to get
06:38 - to some other
06:40 - events which I think are useful to see
06:43 - uh I'm erasing all
06:46 - this so a text input field is a box
06:50 - where a user can type in text like their
06:53 - name so you might say like
06:55 - Name
06:57 - colon an empty Fields so how would you
07:01 - how do you get this on the page create
07:06 - input the create input function creates
07:09 - a text input field on the page so let's
07:12 - add
07:14 - that over here I'm going to add that
07:16 - under slider and you know what I'm going
07:18 - to just be smarter about this and just
07:21 - add a variable input equals create input
07:25 - now let's put something in here in the
07:27 - quotes here name type your name let's
07:31 - run that and see what
07:32 - happens now notice interestingly enough
07:36 - I can populate that text input field in
07:39 - advance by passing an argument to the
07:42 - create input function so whatever right
07:44 - and this is this is sort of a a key
07:46 - piece of information here I'm having
07:48 - trouble with my layout of my window here
07:50 - but you can see that creating different
07:52 - elements requires different arguments a
07:55 - button the text goes inside the button a
07:58 - slider needs a minimum maximum starting
08:00 - value a text input field needs text to
08:03 - start in that input field if I wanted it
08:04 - to be blank I could just take this out
08:08 - and start it with an empty string and
08:10 - you can see that text input field is
08:11 - blank but I'll give it like you know I'm
08:13 - going to write test name you know I'll
08:15 - put that type your name back in here and
08:17 - you can see there it is so
08:19 - now how do I get what the current text
08:23 - is in that box um how do I get that into
08:28 - um How do I access that well guess
08:32 - what I erased it but I wrote down here
08:35 - before the value function the value
08:37 - function pulls out the current value of
08:40 - the slider the numeric value of where
08:42 - the slider is the value function pulls
08:45 - out the current value also of a text
08:47 - input box so this is a sort of important
08:50 - function if I have a an element a text
08:53 - input field a slider and I want to know
08:55 - its current value this P5 Dom Library
08:58 - function value will give me access to
09:00 - that so I can do something like uh here
09:04 - in canvas there is a text function I'm
09:07 - going to say text uh uh let's just test
09:11 - that this works hello uh 10 comma 20 and
09:16 - I'm going to run this and you can see
09:18 - there it is the word hello is on the
09:20 - canvas but now what if I were to say
09:24 - instead input. value so just like I'm
09:28 - using the slide 's value to draw a to
09:31 - set the size of a circle I'm going use
09:33 - the text inputs value to set text that
09:35 - I'm drawing on the
09:38 - canvas so look at this oh look at this
09:40 - it says type your name and now here
09:43 - Daniel schiffman wow this is amazing
09:48 - whatever I type so this is pretty great
09:51 - so you can dynamically access what's in
09:54 - the box through the value function and
09:56 - control to the canvas now I think we
09:58 - better I think we should do something
09:59 - different here so this is great you can
10:01 - see how the all three of these elements
10:03 - work a button click on the button make
10:05 - an event happen click on the slider use
10:08 - the variable use the value of the slider
10:10 - in a variable to control something in
10:12 - the code Type some stuff here change
10:14 - what appears on this in the canvas but I
10:17 - want to do something different what I
10:19 - want to do now is I'm going to go back
10:22 - to this paragraph element and I'm going
10:24 - to say D um your
10:27 - name now look at this this what I want
10:30 - to see is when I'm typing here when I
10:33 - hit
10:34 - enter I want to
10:36 - see that the sorry this paragraph
10:39 - changed to my name okay so what I want
10:42 - to do is not just control something in
10:44 - the canvas I want to control another
10:46 - HTML element from and I'm I'm kind of
10:48 - gone to M my 10-minute Mark here but
10:50 - maybe you're still watching I want to
10:52 - control another element uh uh from from
10:56 - that text input field so let's think
10:58 - about how that works
11:00 - so a quick way that I could do it um
11:03 - sorry we've we've already sort of seen
11:06 - this so let me just come back here and
11:08 - say uh name p and I'm going to say this
11:11 - is name p and in draw I could say
11:16 - name p. HTML input. Val so this is right
11:23 - here right this text function draws text
11:26 - to the canvas this HTML function changes
11:28 - the text of an HTML element to that
11:30 - value so now if I run this you can see
11:34 - here that you know whatever I type here
11:37 - changes in this element but I'm actually
11:40 - only
11:41 - using the uh the fact that draw is
11:44 - looping so actually I think I'm going to
11:46 - stop this and do a I'm going to just
11:48 - continue this discussion in the next
11:50 - video because I think we could look at
11:51 - the difference between um how some of
11:53 - these other events are handled uh we
11:56 - look at a selection of other events um
11:59 - and so I'm going to do that in the next
12:00 - video um but uh uh if so if you're if
12:03 - you're watching this video and stopping
12:04 - here right now what I might suggest that
12:06 - you do is try adding a slider a bunch of
12:09 - Sliders try adding a text field see can
12:12 - you make the can you make the the this
12:14 - text update in the canvas only when you
12:16 - click like a submit button so how what
12:18 - kind of interplay can you have between
12:20 - buttons sliders text fields and Dom
12:23 - elements and in the next video I want to
12:25 - look at other events besides just Mouse
12:27 - press that might be associated with
12:29 - these uh elements okay I'm going to hit
12:32 - uh stop
