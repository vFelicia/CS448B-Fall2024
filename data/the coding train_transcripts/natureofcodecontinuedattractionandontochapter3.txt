06:26 - good morning happy coding train day it
06:31 - is me Dan I was like taken aback by the
06:33 - fact that I had to start I thought I had
06:35 - another 30 seconds there there's a lot
06:39 - to say probably as there often is and
06:42 - I'm you know while you are watching the
06:44 - coding train perhaps at this point it
06:46 - should just be called the nature of
06:47 - coding because I am just still slogging
06:52 - through making the examples in the
06:55 - nature of code book and that's what I'll
06:56 - be continuing today do have some ideas
06:58 - for things in the next few weeks month
07:02 - or two where I will hopefully take a
07:03 - break from nature of code but I would
07:05 - like to by June and kind of get through
07:08 - the entire book we'll see if that
07:09 - happens but before I do any of that at
07:13 - all I have to test something yeah you
07:15 - might I don't know if you noticed
07:17 - something slightly different about me
07:18 - and no no not the haircut there can I
07:20 - had last week same haircut nope not this
07:23 - sweater that I don't think I've ever
07:24 - worn before although I have worn this
07:26 - shirt it's something else
07:29 - I will I will wait for a few minutes to
07:31 - see if anybody can notice something else
07:33 - that's maybe a little different and
07:35 - while I'm waiting I will take a brief
07:37 - moment to thank the sponsor of today's
07:40 - coding train - Lang comm - late is a
07:44 - password manager if you don't have a
07:47 - password manager you should have a
07:49 - password manager and I would - Lane is
07:51 - one that you could try and if you go to
07:53 - - Lang comm slash coding train you can
07:55 - get a 30-day free trial of their premium
07:57 - service and then also if you choose to
07:59 - purchase the p m-- service a 10%
08:01 - discount everybody's got it the jet
08:04 - already everything yes yes
08:06 - new glasses but not just new frames
08:08 - which hopefully you ohhblue reflect okay
08:13 - so that's interesting let me address
08:15 - that so the lenses are really what I'm
08:17 - here to discuss because something quite
08:20 - big has changed I which is these are
08:24 - progressives I've been having a lot of
08:25 - trouble reading really for the last year
08:28 - or two and I would have to take my
08:30 - glasses off to read and so the options
08:34 - as I understand them well besides all
08:36 - sorts of like laser eyes
08:37 - options were to just get a second pair
08:43 - of glasses so I would switch if I'm
08:44 - gonna read but that's sort of silly
08:46 - because I could just take them off to
08:47 - read which I was fine doing I was that
08:51 - well the other option was just do
08:53 - nothing but the third option was get
08:55 - progressives which I now have and I have
08:56 - to say yeah I mean I've only had them
08:58 - for I think I got them on Tuesday so I
09:01 - mean like for about 48 hours in and I'm
09:04 - having quite a difficult time with them
09:05 - if I'm being perfectly honest although
09:06 - I'm much more used to them today than I
09:08 - was yesterday or the day before but I
09:10 - don't know if anybody watching we're all
09:12 - so young and youthful with your
09:15 - excellent eyesight oh just wait just
09:18 - wait until you get to be me and you need
09:20 - these but I didn't really rise is your
09:23 - but because of the way the lenses
09:24 - progress for distance and reading
09:29 - there's some distortion on the sides and
09:32 - we're going to create that progression
09:34 - and so it's my peripheral vision is less
09:38 - it's has a smaller cone a focal poke
09:44 - what's the thing Fache frustum my
09:46 - frustum vision is smaller but the good
09:50 - news is I mean all for you the viewing
09:54 - audience because I know your favorite
09:55 - part is me reading random numbers I'm
09:59 - looking at the chat here and this I
10:02 - could just do so easily now the reading
10:05 - is quite phenomenal and I I wasn't
10:08 - really able to before so we're gonna do
10:09 - a reading of the ceremonial reading of
10:13 - the random numbers with my new
10:16 - progressive lenses and people had
10:18 - mentioned there's a blue and so I did
10:22 - get I did I don't know maybe this is
10:24 - silly but I did get the blue light
10:26 - filter in them which hopefully is not
10:28 - going to be too distracting or cause
10:30 - like weird reflection in me making these
10:32 - videos but we'll find out field of view
10:35 - thank you I have a problem I can't
10:38 - remember words anymore I think it's
10:42 - related to the fact that I need lenses
10:45 - it's good stuffs all going downhill they
10:47 - go watch my I always say like all those
10:48 - videos are so old or out-of-date
10:50 - I think I had was like I was what were
10:52 - with it then so let me go back and watch
10:54 - the old nature of code videos 931 fifty
11:03 - two thousand one hundred and seven
11:05 - ninety two thousand eight hundred and
11:08 - twenty three thirty nine thousand nine
11:10 - hundred and ninety four seventy four
11:13 - thousand six hundred seventy seven
11:15 - ninety nine thousand four hundred and
11:18 - seventy one fifty four thousand and
11:21 - sixty five fifty four thousand nine
11:28 - ninety six thousand two hundred and
11:31 - fifty six 80 thousand eight hundred
11:33 - twenty three twenty five thousand four
11:36 - hundred and seventy nine seventy
11:39 - thousand eight hundred and twenty three
11:42 - thirty nine thousand six seventy nine
11:46 - thousand two hundred and ninety four
11:48 - ninety three thousand one hundred and
11:51 - seventy thirty four thousand four
11:54 - hundred and sixty nine the music is a
11:59 - bit loud
12:00 - okay thank you that's useful to know
12:03 - that's a oh my goodness it certainly is
12:06 - sorry about that no wonder everything
12:09 - seemed off sorry about that
12:11 - I'm fixing why is blue filter useless no
12:14 - I I think it is useful I'm just
12:16 - sometimes I wonder like what's this
12:18 - what's the real science behind blue
12:19 - light filtering and what studies have
12:22 - been done and how effective is it how
12:24 - bad is blue light how effective it's the
12:26 - filtering but you know and you know one
12:29 - thing that I try to do is you know I
12:31 - really give myself like I should give
12:33 - myself like at 8:00 p.m. limit but 9:00
12:35 - p.m. I try after 9:00 p.m. I try to look
12:37 - at no phone no screens nothing I'm
12:40 - watching a movie or whatever but and I
12:44 - don't want the fact that I have a blue
12:46 - light filter to give me an excuse if you
12:48 - like oh now at night I can play pokemons
12:51 - go on my phone not that that's what I
12:52 - play I don't play that no that's like
12:54 - that's like so two years ago and you
12:58 - know people in their 40s don't play that
12:59 - anyway so why why would I be playing
13:01 - that no definitely not I do not
13:03 - like trying to get to level 40 or
13:05 - anything and I don't have like extra
13:06 - yeah no no no no no that's somebody else
13:14 - [Music]
13:17 - it's 8 p.m. a year coincidently yes Sri
13:20 - young turn this off you've got to get to
13:25 - sleep soon
13:26 - too blue light for emanating it's not
13:29 - worth it
13:29 - the coding train is not worth it'll be
13:31 - here tomorrow morning when you wake up
13:32 - and our fresh I do use nightshift yes I
13:37 - do
13:38 - I do use night shift Luke is asking to
13:40 - use the night shift I also use that
13:42 - which I quite enjoy all right I would
13:45 - like to get into it pretty quickly I'm
13:48 - there's a little less of the high jinks
13:51 - these days on the coding train because
13:54 - I'm trying to I'm trying to be a serious
13:56 - teacher of content I'll be here till
14:01 - around noon and that's that let's see
14:08 - what other kind of OC like my screen is
14:14 - like distorted especially I'll look from
14:15 - left to right it's like a waving bubbly
14:17 - thing whoo okay but I'm gonna I'm gonna
14:20 - I'm gonna be fine all right let's open
14:23 - up the Chrome browser and let me just
14:33 - mention one thing and I'm really not
14:37 - mentioning this to ask anyone to buy
14:39 - anything or spend any money I just want
14:41 - to let you know what's going on because
14:43 - some people have asked the coding train
14:47 - hoodies have hit the minimum number of
14:49 - orders to get made so they will be on
14:51 - the way nobody needs to buy anymore but
14:53 - I just wanted to mention that if you
14:55 - were interested I think maybe tomorrow
14:58 - I'm gonna say hey go ahead
14:59 - that's enough orders send them to the
15:02 - hoodie maker and so I don't know that
15:07 - you'll be able to order them anymore
15:08 - after tomorrow so if you were interested
15:10 - in getting a hooked coding trade hoodie
15:12 - I know I mean hopefully we can put them
15:14 - up for sale again or make them or make
15:15 - t-shirts
15:16 - something new next time but I'm they do
15:18 - these are being done in limited runs in
15:20 - in terms of how they're being made and
15:21 - the quality so if you were interested in
15:24 - one of those
15:26 - now's your lucky your last chance okay
15:34 - I also by the way I put one of these
15:37 - mugs in the dishwasher here at work and
15:39 - it got a little faded so if you have one
15:40 - of the mugs you can wash it and wash it
15:43 - does anybody have one of these I don't
15:45 - have one of these if you have one of
15:47 - these could you send me a like picture
15:51 - of it or something sends me on Twitter
15:53 - social media whatever disk or join the
15:56 - discord that's the other thing that I
15:57 - was like to mention the discord has been
15:59 - as far as I'm concerned a big success I
16:01 - don't success is the right word but has
16:03 - been really productive in that it's III
16:06 - don't know where to tell people to go to
16:08 - get help specifically related to the
16:10 - content of my videos there's lots of
16:13 - places on the Internet to get code help
16:15 - some are you know they all have their
16:18 - pros and cons and they're sort of vibes
16:20 - and different strokes for different
16:22 - folks the processing forum discourse
16:26 - discourse it's confusing is not discord
16:31 - but discourse dot processing dot org is
16:34 - a really excellent place to ask
16:36 - questions about processing and p5.js
16:39 - specifically and I would say there's a
16:41 - lot of crossover between the coding
16:43 - train community and the processing
16:45 - discourse but if you want to engage with
16:48 - getting help from the you know laser
16:51 - focused coding train passengers then the
16:55 - discord is the place for you to do that
16:56 - and if somebody I know that I saw Kobe's
17:00 - name pop up in the chat is can post a
17:03 - link to joining the discourse the
17:05 - discord in in the YouTube chat that
17:10 - would be helpful
17:12 - now I also wanted to mention a couple
17:15 - other things Google Summer of Code
17:24 - I think this will get me to the site I
17:26 - can't remember if I mentioned this or
17:27 - not but the organization's have been
17:29 - announced yeah because this was
17:30 - announced before I probably mentioned
17:31 - this last week but google Summer of Code
17:33 - is a program that I participate in as
17:36 - part of the processing foundation but
17:38 - there are over 200 I think whoa
17:41 - oh no 686 over how ever many years but
17:46 - there are a large number of other
17:49 - open-source organizations that
17:51 - participate as mentoring organizations
17:54 - for google Summer of Code and you if you
17:56 - are a student I mean do have to be a
17:57 - student unfortunately or fortunately you
17:59 - can apply to work with collaborate with
18:03 - make an open-source contribution to one
18:06 - of those projects over the summer and
18:07 - get paid a stipend so again I'm not an
18:09 - official representative of Google or
18:11 - Google Summer of Code all of the
18:13 - administration and application process
18:14 - and eligibility is handled through them
18:16 - I'm just here because it's a program
18:18 - that I participate in as a mentor and
18:21 - would love to encourage you to apply if
18:24 - it's something that interests you and to
18:27 - the extent that I can help with that or
18:28 - we can maybe we can open a discord
18:29 - channel for people who are questions
18:31 - about that that's something that I would
18:33 - be open to Thank You Koby for posting
18:36 - the discord invite I should probably
18:37 - just get a button like I have one button
18:39 - on my stream deck when I press it it
18:42 - both choo-choo into the chat you know I
18:45 - should maybe make one I need to get the
18:46 - dist that stream deck with the with more
18:49 - buttons I need more buttons oh my god I
18:51 - just want I just like a giant panel of
18:54 - buttons that's my dream all right so
18:58 - that's the nature of code is what I'm
19:00 - gonna be doing what other things I
19:02 - shouldn't make a list of it'll be so
19:04 - helpful if I've just made a list of
19:06 - things that I wanted to mention as
19:07 - opposed to just try to remember them
19:09 - while I'm live-streaming just think
19:10 - about this for a moment
19:12 - [Music]
19:21 - I thought of it alright so there's two
19:24 - things up and coming on this channel
19:26 - that are unrelated to the nature of code
19:30 - Oh everything's kind of related nature
19:32 - of code one is March 14th is Pi Day
19:36 - and traditionally I've tried to do
19:38 - something special to mark the occasion I
19:41 - will be not available to livestream on
19:45 - pi day so I'm probably going to prepare
19:48 - something in advance to really be
19:49 - released on pi day but I don't have any
19:52 - idea what to do so if if you know
19:59 - certainly I'll take suggestions in the
20:00 - discord but right now for better or
20:03 - worse the system is a github repo where
20:06 - you can if you have a suggestion for a
20:08 - topic oh whoa whoa hold the presses do
20:21 - welcome for your membership to the
20:24 - coding train you have one random number
20:28 - [Music]
20:38 - and that number is 90 4544 you are the
20:42 - sole owner I mean I don't think we're
20:45 - ever gonna get to a million members that
20:46 - would be kind of nuts I will just ride
20:49 - off into the sunset if that happens and
20:52 - thank you by the way if you don't know
20:57 - there let me see if I can find how am I
21:00 - gonna do this
21:14 - I'm looking for there we go perfect this
21:16 - is what I'm looking for if you are not
21:17 - aware and I'm sorry if you don't want me
21:19 - to be plugging this it's too late for
21:20 - you you put this on the internet I get
21:22 - to plug it without your permission
21:27 - Jose teaches a course called
21:30 - introduction to computational design and
21:32 - it seems like it's at Harvard and all of
21:36 - the lectures are all online in this
21:40 - playlist is this a learning playlist or
21:43 - is it just a regular playlist you should
21:45 - get access to the learning playlist if
21:47 - it's not it looks like a learning
21:48 - playlist so check check this out welcome
21:54 - well thank you I uh I was talking about
21:56 - something high day so back to this so if
22:01 - I go to label you won't be able to add
22:03 - your own label but I encourage you to
22:04 - file your issue with your suggestion and
22:06 - then I will or somebody else will add it
22:08 - but I'm just gonna see what's there
22:10 - right now so Pi Day 2020 let's see
22:15 - there's every year so you look at this
22:17 - every year damn does a couple cool yes
22:19 - thank you I am as my kids tell me very
22:22 - cool I'm the cool dad definitely every
22:27 - year dance has a couple cool coding
22:29 - challenges related to calculating
22:31 - visualizing or using pi this year would
22:34 - be a good time to start a pythons no no
22:42 - no you make last year's pi day
22:44 - challenges in Python and also explain
22:46 - Python today it is a really nice idea
22:49 - ddddd ttttt but i'm not sure that that's
23:01 - gonna fit with my schedule and something
23:05 - there you know actually at my son's
23:08 - school not to keep talking about my kids
23:09 - today but they're always on my mind they
23:12 - have a PI digit memorization contest so
23:15 - I one thing I was thinking is there a
23:16 - tool I could build it helps people
23:18 - memorize the digits of pi if you have
23:20 - any ideas about that but it really
23:21 - anything that is
23:24 - eh especially if it's like a beautiful
23:26 - geometric pattern algorithmic pattern
23:29 - that's what I really like to do for
23:30 - these kind of challenges that relates to
23:33 - PI and the mathematics associated with
23:38 - PI then please suggest that here as a
23:45 - github issue or talk about it in in the
23:52 - discord otherwise I will be just baking
23:54 - a pie oh that's what I should do clearly
23:57 - I mean because have you all seen the
23:59 - bone Appetit YouTube channel I know I'm
24:01 - like really late on this but it is just
24:04 - Oh chefs kiss I just wish that I could
24:08 - be like one of their cooking people
24:11 - which I definitely cannot be there's no
24:13 - way but I aspire I can a spike in dream
24:16 - D t6o which i assume is the same ddddd
24:20 - tttt tttt has memorized 80 digits of pi
24:24 - i was like how did you do that maybe I
24:26 - should just try to memorize them but I
24:28 - think is I don't think I can do a live
24:29 - stream so I don't think I'll be like a
24:30 - live PI day live stream this year but I
24:34 - do want to do just like a video maybe
24:35 - I'll do it as a Cabana one or something
24:37 - like that will I be here on towel day
24:43 - yeah maybe I'll just wait till tala day
24:44 - so that's number one number two is
24:46 - insanely and I really don't understand
24:50 - how this is possible but it seems as if
24:52 - this channel will soon have 1 million
24:56 - subscribers I'm assuming that then the
24:58 - next day they'll just like everybody
24:59 - will unsubscribe but you know probably
25:02 - at least for a day and me I kind of want
25:05 - to do nothing like just like keep going
25:07 - is I'm usually doing but people are
25:08 - asking and maybe it is a nice thing to
25:10 - think of doing something special to
25:12 - celebrate that so I could use ideas I
25:15 - really want to do something with the
25:17 - original unoriginal I I know I got I'm
25:20 - gonna keep mentioning this till somebody
25:21 - if you live near a like a rare bookstore
25:25 - or have some way of finding a copy of an
25:31 - original print I will pay I will pay for
25:33 - shipping I will purchase all these
25:35 - things I would very much like to
25:36 - purchase
25:37 - a original print of this million random
25:40 - number book I have found some listed
25:42 - online but there's no way for me to
25:44 - authenticate them and I've emailed and
25:47 - asked and I mostly I'm seeing them three
25:49 - amazon listings and no one will give me
25:51 - any real information and I don't feel
25:53 - like it's a good idea to spend a large
25:55 - amount of money to purchase something
25:56 - that I have no idea what it really is
25:57 - okay
26:00 - [Music]
26:04 - oh Lord
26:08 - the cutting tree hit with your
26:11 - membership of the coding train you have
26:13 - won stickers in the name eventually
26:27 - eleven thousand eight hundred and twenty
26:29 - seven new member that I already now
26:32 - can't see in the chat anymore I think
26:34 - was Adrienne that is your random number
26:36 - you're the sole owner of the random
26:39 - number eleven thousand or twenty seven
26:40 - please write that down because I won't
26:43 - remember I suppose a lot of the numbers
26:45 - appear more than once in this book
26:47 - though so you might have an issue there
26:49 - this this is the million random digits
26:51 - doesn't mean B million unique random
26:54 - digits okay now so that was that ideas
27:04 - for any kind of special video for
27:06 - million subscribers I would the other
27:11 - thing that's on my mind related to that
27:15 - was it oh yes I'll bring this up in the
27:18 - discord and maybe um I am working on
27:20 - training a machine learning model to
27:22 - generate text based on all of the
27:26 - captions of all of my videos ever and I
27:29 - could use some help with that so but
27:32 - that all that I'll bring up in the
27:33 - discord row that's a separate thing
27:34 - alright numberphile showed that 39
27:37 - digits of pi would calculate the
27:38 - circumference of the known universe to
27:41 - the width of a hydrogen atom whoa
27:48 - whoa okay
27:52 - that's intense oh my goodness
27:57 - Simon Says Simon Says that is
28:02 - calculating the rate that I'm getting
28:04 - subscribers and estimating that this
28:06 - might actually happen on pi day ah
28:09 - well can you slow down please I'm not
28:13 - ready
28:14 - April first I think is a much more
28:16 - appropriate day for me than pi day said
28:18 - that last week okay so I think I better
28:23 - get started it's 10 o'clock half an hour
28:25 - should really be my limit of shenanigans
28:28 - let me go to the web editor of p5 oh
28:36 - wait hey where's my what's going on here
28:40 - here we go
28:51 - look at this huh isn't Ashley wonderful
28:54 - it got me logged into the coding drain
28:56 - editor and I have no idea what my
28:57 - password is it doesn't matter cuz I'm
29:00 - using
29:02 - okay hmm 36 I think is the number I tend
29:06 - to use let me go to where I left off
29:09 - last mmm whoa what is going on here oh
29:17 - by the way this is a little this is kind
29:19 - of an aside and maybe I shouldn't be
29:21 - showing this but let's see if this works
29:24 - I was helping a colleague who's teaching
29:29 - a class about animation and this is like
29:32 - an animation I think made does it made
29:36 - an illustrator knowing After Effects but
29:38 - using a library called using a library
29:43 - called la tjs and these are some like
29:46 - Lodi and p5 examples actually don't know
29:48 - what I'm talking about but I helped de
29:50 - minimus but it's cool because like the
29:53 - whole animation is all just in this big
29:55 - like JSON file and then I have p5 like
29:59 - playing it back which is kind of cool
30:00 - alright but that's I someday I would
30:02 - like to make some videos about this with
30:05 - alone who I worked on this example with
30:07 - ok coming back to opening my sketches
30:10 - the one that I want to get is this here
30:13 - we go so this is where I left off this
30:15 - is the last we last left off all our
30:23 - rights we miss Adam or vias code we
30:26 - don't like the browser-based editor too
30:29 - bad no no I get it I get it
30:32 - thank you for your feedback in your
30:33 - comment it's important for me to use
30:36 - this editor because it is a tool that
30:39 - I'm feel very invested in in helping it
30:42 - grow and for it being something that is
30:45 - a really friendly easy place for people
30:47 - to start to learn coding so when I do
30:50 - certain projects that really don't fit
30:52 - well with the web editor I certainly
30:53 - will do things outside of it but I do
30:56 - feel like it is a useful tool for me to
30:59 - demonstrate the basic nature of code
31:01 - examples
31:03 - okay hello Argentina people of Argentina
31:12 - [Music]
31:17 - okay all right I think I'm trying I just
31:25 - trying to figure out where I want to
31:26 - kind of begin with this
31:37 - all right I am going to actually go for
31:44 - it whoops no I don't want to download
31:45 - this I'm gonna go further back
31:54 - friction forces 1 I think this is yeah
31:59 - yeah this is where I'm gonna this is the
32:01 - example I'm gonna build on it okay
32:04 - I really am having trouble because I
32:06 - don't have peripheral vision so to see
32:08 - the screen over here to turn all the way
32:11 - to the side okay I'm gonna need to start
32:18 - all my recording things so let me do
32:20 - that actually now start recording let me
32:24 - go here and set the multi quarter to go
32:27 - um one thing I also want to mention is
32:30 - I've had a little bit of audio
32:33 - interference
32:34 - I'm noticed it must not be significant
32:36 - because nobody is ever says anything to
32:38 - bring the live stream or at least I
32:39 - don't catch it if you are if you're
32:42 - noticing like a little almost like and
32:45 - you know the the sits just like a sort
32:48 - of like a high-pitched hum that sort of
32:51 - like slowly fades in and fades out if
32:53 - you're hearing that could you let me
32:54 - know at any point and I'm just trying to
32:58 - get the various chat things back up here
33:01 - is there we go the YouTube chat back up
33:10 - you can see that Oh Simon is giving me
33:14 - some excellent suggestions about
33:16 - additional things I could do you know
33:18 - I've got to move on to chapter 3 but I I
33:20 - hear you read the entire book online for
33:30 - free how nice okay and then I want to go
33:34 - to where am I
33:37 - forces holding chapter 2 boy this is
33:40 - going very slowly and
33:50 - here we go okay so this is what I'm
33:57 - going to be doing today I am going to go
34:00 - through this particular scenario and
34:05 - example I need a minute to pull myself
34:06 - together here and by the way oh I don't
34:12 - want to show this diagram because this
34:14 - diagram is absolutely incorrect there's
34:16 - a major flaw in this diagram I think I
34:20 - can't remember if I fixed it or not and
34:22 - just not on the website but this are
34:25 - needs to be the distance between the
34:27 - Centers of the bodies not the edges of
34:29 - the bodies so I hate to show this I mean
34:34 - one option is could replace it later
34:36 - so maybe much yeah what we're gonna do
34:40 - today is I'm gonna leave this flawed
34:43 - diagram up and then I will I fix it in
34:48 - Illustrator and we'll just like replace
34:51 - that in post even if the recording
34:54 - system isn't working we don't have the
34:55 - separate green stuff we can I'm pretty
34:58 - sure like overlaying a diagram should be
35:01 - possible although I'm gonna like point
35:02 - to it and stuff like that so that's
35:04 - gonna really mess us up but whatever
35:06 - we're gonna try our best we're gonna
35:07 - hope for the best everybody that is an
35:12 - absolute mistake alright so if I'm
35:18 - making a brief list I'm gonna does this
35:23 - overhead thing working know what
35:25 - happened my overhead camera so sad
35:28 - that's weird
35:29 - oh well I am going to let me make a list
35:35 - so the first thing I'm gonna do is just
35:38 - do attraction and then I'm gonna I think
35:42 - in the same video I can make an array
35:45 - making notes to myself here you know
35:48 - what usually I type these out let me do
35:49 - that so you can see it right because
35:54 - actually I have it here
35:57 - right uh okay here we go oh right so
35:59 - I've done all these I already have these
36:01 - nodes all right so this is done so
36:11 - gravitational attraction plus array I
36:16 - think I could do that in one will file
36:18 - might change that I think that can be in
36:20 - one then I'm going to do repulsion plus
36:29 - like a kind of group behavior so instead
36:33 - of there being separate attractors a
36:35 - separate attractor and movers or bodies
36:40 - whatever I want to call them particles
36:41 - I'm gonna have them interact with each
36:43 - other and then I'll add and I think this
36:48 - could I think this could all be in one
36:49 - so I think hopefully this will be two
36:51 - videos right do the implement the basic
36:56 - gravitational attraction then I just
36:58 - switch it to repulsion and show I could
37:00 - make it a group behavior and a wall
37:02 - force and then I also have I should look
37:04 - like some of this is a little bit
37:05 - redundant content because last year I
37:07 - did a traction coding challenge couldn't
37:12 - challenge fifty-six I guess that's more
37:13 - than though that's what we go oh
37:16 - are you insane have I really been doing
37:19 - this for this long that it felt like oh
37:21 - that was just last year that was three
37:22 - years ago that I did the attraction and
37:25 - repulsion coding challenge just look at
37:29 - the code did I I'm hoping that I was
37:32 - using es6 classes at the time I was or I
37:35 - changed it whoa all right okay so then
37:42 - there's also this so I'm gonna refer to
37:45 - this coding challenge and also include
37:47 - it in the playlist and are noting the
37:50 - chat is and my minds are exactly aligned
37:53 - here Arn don't forget to mention your
37:59 - coding challenge on attraction repulsion
38:01 - okay so yeah so you know a few years ago
38:04 - I didn't feel like I had time to redo
38:07 - the full nature of code tutorial series
38:09 - and so I
38:10 - picked and choose little things and did
38:12 - them as coding challenges gym anyway
38:13 - makes more sense because I kind of make
38:15 - one video that has a whole lot of
38:17 - concepts all in it but this year I'm
38:19 - doing it differently and as soon as I do
38:21 - this I can no longer see because this is
38:24 - the reading part distance reading
38:27 - distance whoa I'm dizzy dizzy okay so
38:46 - that's there
38:51 - this is Jose's playlist and I'd
39:00 - mentioned pi day anybody anybody file
39:01 - any issues money to pi day ideas okay
39:07 - and then Here I am and then Here I am
39:10 - alright okay let me just
39:44 - actually you know what I'm gonna do this
39:49 - get rid of this interest thing oh boy
39:52 - boy duplicate duplicate duplicate oh did
39:55 - I mess it up hold on everybody let me
40:04 - just I might have messed up that other
40:06 - example and if I did I just want to
40:07 - check real quick I think I did oh no I
40:16 - left I might have like changed something
40:17 - but oh yeah okay so this doesn't need to
40:20 - be in there and mover is fine okay great
40:28 - that's fine I'm here get rid of the
40:31 - edges function and oh I'd if I also want
40:40 - mass hold on I don't need edges I don't
40:49 - need this you'll see but I also want to
40:54 - get the idea of mass back in here which
40:57 - I implemented in the previous one this
41:01 - stuff would be nice if I did this in
41:02 - advance so apologies a drag so what I
41:09 - did in the previous one is added mass
41:16 - hold on and then I calculated the radius
41:19 - based on the mass so that's gonna go in
41:23 - here and it's gonna take a third
41:27 - argument and
41:31 - also / mass and then add that and then
41:56 - what else what else what else I think
41:59 - and then I just need to give it a mass
42:01 - here like five okay great all right
42:08 - I love the Wesley Crusher reference in
42:15 - the chat right now by the way all right
42:20 - Adrian thank you for your new membership
42:22 - I winced identity I happened to see your
42:25 - message to the YouTube chat but pi day
42:27 - suggestions if you want me to see them
42:28 - the discord or the github repo is the
42:32 - best place all right but please talk
42:35 - amongst yourself about all sorts of pi
42:37 - day ideas in the chat
42:46 - I don't need this anymore all right here
42:48 - we go is there are you serious oh this
42:58 - is the worst okay the worst this is the
43:01 - terrible thing that I have discovered on
43:03 - the internet today that when I mean it's
43:06 - mic no I'm not signed in hmm
43:09 - when you search gravitational attraction
43:17 - this image comes up just from my book
43:20 - would you read it would be great bonanza
43:21 - mistake in it oh look at this what a
43:32 - coincidence
43:33 - so by the way my the book is Creative
43:35 - Commons non-commercial and Khan Academy
43:37 - hugely correct diagram also has a
43:44 - basically AB duplicated version with a
43:47 - bunch of changes of the nature of code
43:49 - book hopefully that I'm credited on here
43:52 - but I think that I am Shh
43:56 - but I'm looking for yeah this is what I
43:58 - want to look for yeah here we go
44:15 - all right I have such trouble getting
44:22 - started but it is time for me to get
44:25 - started
44:25 - got to get some stuff done today not
44:27 - looking at my email if I wanted to I
44:29 - could just pull pick up my phone I have
44:31 - progressive lenses so I can see it
44:33 - really well and I could see if I have
44:35 - any important messages but what could be
44:36 - more important than what happens we know
44:38 - nothing but the phone is going further
44:41 - away I see it out of the corner of my
44:43 - eye it's going over here I'm taking this
44:46 - coding training notebook I'm taking the
44:48 - phone
44:49 - putting the notebook on top of the phone
44:51 - and it's going over there
45:11 - all right
45:18 - and we're gonna start having trouble
45:21 - where does some encouragement please
45:23 - little by the time started by the time
45:25 - you hear me say that's never mind
45:32 - stretch everybody stretch if you're
45:35 - watching and you can whatever works best
45:38 - for you to like move any parts of your
45:41 - body that you can move stretch oh so
45:48 - Raul says just heard the noise hearing
45:50 - the chirp what can I do about that
45:53 - all right let me I have a suspicion that
45:56 - maybe where this receiver is placed so I
45:59 - have an idea so thank you for telling me
46:05 - that you heard the chirp and now I'm
46:11 - hoping I moved some wires around hold on
46:21 - there's one other wire that I should
46:22 - maybe move that could be having like
46:23 - some interference okay so hopefully
46:31 - that's going to do the trick I think you
46:35 - you need the CJ timer I definitely do
46:41 - happens when I do certain poses Oh
46:45 - could it be I don't have any like I
46:48 - don't have any other electronic devices
46:49 - in my pocket and could it be the zipper
46:55 - or something this is the mic
47:00 - well alright alright everybody listen
47:03 - listen standing still talking talking
47:08 - talking talking does it happen
47:15 - I'll do anything to not have to do like
47:18 - coding tutorial
47:19 - can you tell okay oh it's ten third all
47:24 - right this is this is bad start all
47:27 - right
47:37 - hello and welcome to another I mean now
47:44 - what he wants to look if they're
47:46 - watching the secrets and I just keep
47:47 - thinking welcome to but I don't know
47:48 - what else to say
47:52 - all right no I don't like starting with
47:55 - that way either it is time for Newton's
48:04 - law of universal gravitation so this is
48:08 - the final example that I will be
48:10 - demonstrating as part of chapter two
48:12 - although the concept of forces and how
48:14 - they are applied permeate throughout the
48:16 - rest of the video that I intend to make
48:18 - but I'm gonna wrap up this chapter by
48:20 - looking at the equation for universal
48:23 - gravitation that looks exactly like this
48:25 - and trying to see can I take this
48:27 - equation and implement it in a p5.js
48:30 - sketch okay so that's good that's the
48:35 - only one I wanted to say at the
48:36 - beginning so much but I'm we're gonna
48:44 - sort of like hope we can fix this we'll
48:48 - see well I can always come back and
48:50 - rerecord or something okay
48:59 - let me just see here
49:20 - here's the same formula with a diagram
49:23 - in the nature of codebook itself so the
49:25 - idea of this law is that every body
49:27 - every particle every thing in the
49:30 - universe attracts every other thing with
49:33 - the force that's proportional to the
49:35 - masses of those bodies and inversely
49:38 - proportional to how far apart they are
49:39 - so the farther apart they are the weaker
49:42 - the force the closer they are the
49:44 - stronger the force I did something very
49:52 - much like this in the first example as
49:54 - part of this series where I had done
49:56 - actually look let me actually put this
50:00 - here
50:08 - all right
50:12 - oh it's my watch
50:19 - is my watch doing it okay that's easy I
50:22 - don't need to wear this silly overpriced
50:26 - Pisa unka exercise tracking surveillance
50:34 - couch or okay look I do some free iPhone
50:41 - and watch your God all right
51:02 - so I know I don't think it's worth me
51:05 - was it really bad and is it really bad
51:12 - that I need to go back and redo the
51:14 - intro or was it fine
51:18 - like the glitchyness audio it's going to
51:21 - end up in the edited version of this but
51:23 - if it's just like a little minor hum big
51:25 - deal did it happen again all right I'm
51:39 - gonna just keep going
51:42 - turn it again oh well what could it be I
51:52 - wonder I guess I could change the it is
51:55 - it just the Bell fine good all right all
52:00 - right I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna keep
52:03 - going
52:16 - in the first in the first example in
52:19 - this chapter I did something very
52:21 - similar to this idea of the law of
52:22 - attraction
52:23 - I created a vector that points from the
52:26 - mover object to the mouse and then made
52:28 - that vector the acceleration of the
52:31 - mover object itself and it appears if if
52:33 - this body like orbiting the mouse itself
52:36 - I got it so there is sort of a problem
52:43 - with me keeping my eye on the chat is
52:44 - it's very distracting and I lose my
52:46 - momentum so I'm gonna just take a break
52:47 - from looking at the chat and I'm gonna
52:49 - I'm gonna move I'm gonna plow forward
52:51 - this cuz I shouldn't keep stopping and
52:53 - starting hey what's going on here
53:05 - I did something in the first example on
53:10 - this in the series very similar where I
53:12 - took a mover object and created a vector
53:15 - that pointed from that mover object to
53:17 - the mouse itself and set that vector as
53:19 - the acceleration of the object so this
53:22 - was like attraction but I wasn't
53:23 - thinking about mass and I wasn't
53:25 - thinking about distance let me try to
53:32 - diagram what it is that I want to do I
53:34 - want to have a new object that's called
53:37 - an attractor so I'm not actually going
53:39 - to at this moment in I just I realized
53:47 - something
53:59 - let me diagram what I want to do in this
54:02 - video so I'm gonna simplify things and
54:04 - have this concept of an attractor object
54:07 - so the attractor object isn't a real
54:09 - body in the universe it's a fixed entity
54:11 - that does it that that attracts things
54:14 - to it but it cannot move and it cannot
54:16 - experience forces itself then I'm going
54:18 - to have the mover object with some given
54:21 - velocity and the mover object the
54:23 - attractor is basically the mouse from
54:25 - the previously but the mover object is
54:27 - going to experience a force a
54:30 - gravitational force that pulls it to the
54:33 - attractor and that force which is a
54:36 - vector is going to be equal to the mass
54:38 - of one object times the mass of the
54:41 - other object divided by the distance
54:43 - squared and I put this in the wrong
54:46 - order but also times G which is the
54:49 - universal gravitational constant
55:02 - now there's a very real number that is
55:06 - this value in the universe as we know it
55:10 - but for us in our fake p5 or I don't
55:15 - want to say fake I'm say pretend but for
55:23 - us in our in our pretend p5 canvas over
55:27 - this word ok I understand what I'm doing
55:31 - now but for us in our pretend p5 canvas
55:38 - if I draw like a box around this G is
55:42 - just a way for us to kind of like tune
55:44 - the the world to have stronger
55:45 - gravitational attraction or weaker
55:48 - attraction forces and in a way I could
55:52 - think of this G as a property of the
55:55 - attractor itself may be different
55:57 - attractors have different constants
55:59 - although to some extent that is taken
56:01 - care of by the mass but I have
56:03 - everything that I want I can make up
56:22 - so I need everything that's in this
56:25 - formula I need to figure out where is it
56:27 - here so the mass of one object well
56:30 - would be the mass of this mover object
56:32 - the mass of the other object would be
56:33 - the mass of the attractor so to some
56:36 - extent the mass and gee I could conflate
56:38 - these into one constant but I'll keep an
56:39 - exception for now distance is the
56:42 - distance between the Centers of both
56:45 - objects so remember when I'm calculating
56:48 - a force I need two things I need
56:51 - direction and I need magnitude so this
56:55 - is really all of these numbers are
56:56 - talking about the magnitude how strong
56:58 - is that force how long is this arrow
57:01 - that I'm drawing here the direction is
57:04 - just a vector that points from the
57:06 - object being attracted to the attractor
57:09 - and so that I can get there's a bunch of
57:13 - times now with subtraction so the sum
57:16 - function for subtraction I can take the
57:18 - position of the attractor minus the
57:20 - position of the mover and that gives me
57:22 - a vector that points this way set its
57:24 - magnitude to the result of this formula
57:26 - and voila
57:27 - I have gravitational attraction okay
57:50 - so coming back to this example I am
57:52 - going to now get rid of this
57:55 - acceleration calculation and when I run
57:58 - the sketch I should just see this mover
58:00 - not moving at all
58:06 - and in the main tap sorry and in the
58:12 - main JavaScript file where I have set up
58:14 - a draw I want to add an attractor so
58:24 - I'll create an attractor that also gets
58:27 - in X Y position and a mass
58:37 - I'll say a tractor
58:40 - attracts mover and a tractor dot show
58:58 - now I might have just confused to you
59:00 - for a second there because you might be
59:02 - thinking wait did I miss something did
59:03 - you write in a tractor class and is this
59:06 - just gonna work right now definitely not
59:08 - like when I run this is gonna be like I
59:09 - have no idea what that is so this is the
59:11 - way that I work sometimes it's a little
59:13 - bit of flawed me making this tutorial
59:14 - video because this is probably an
59:15 - example that I've written many many
59:16 - times so I had it just sort of right in
59:18 - my mind at the ready but sometimes it
59:20 - can be helpful to sort of sketch out
59:23 - what did how it is you imagine writing
59:26 - the code to operate an object before
59:28 - writing the class because now I have the
59:30 - instructions for what it is I need to
59:32 - write I need to make a class called
59:34 - attractor the constructor takes three
59:36 - arguments it needs to have a show
59:38 - function and it also needs to have an
59:39 - attraction that receives a mover object
59:42 - so all of these things are now at things
59:45 - that I can write into the attractor
59:47 - class I've already created another
59:49 - JavaScript file attractor j/s which is
59:51 - empty so I'll put class attractor in
59:58 - there then write the constructor which
60:05 - if you remember required three arguments
60:08 - an X Y and amass the X while used for
60:10 - position the ammo use for math let me
60:21 - write a show function just to draw it as
60:22 - a circle
60:34 - I'm now realizing I should calculate a
60:37 - radius based on mass the same way that I
60:40 - did in the previous examples with the
60:42 - mover so I'm just gonna grab this code
60:47 - which takes the mass takes the square
60:49 - root multiplies by 10 I'll use the same
60:51 - convention and then so let's leave out
61:04 - the attract function for a moment
61:09 - comment that out move the mover to like
61:14 - a little higher up in the canvas run it
61:17 - and what do I have now tractors not fine
61:20 - oh I can never seem to remember to add
61:26 - the script tag when I have a new
61:27 - javascript file and here we go alright
61:34 - now I see the attractor and the mover so
61:37 - the net would have been chat
61:48 - now I see the attractor guess I'm
61:52 - looking at the chest now I'm seeing both
61:59 - the mover object and the attractor
62:00 - object the next step is just to actually
62:03 - write a function in the attractor object
62:06 - that we're that loud noise
62:22 - you have a vector on the left side the
62:27 - feedback was bad when you were at the
62:29 - white hold on time after second
62:31 - the feedback was bad when you're at the
62:32 - white board might be from the mic cable
62:34 - moving so what might Cable moving do you
62:38 - mean just like this
62:50 - and then you have a vector on the left
62:52 - side and a scaler on the right side oh
62:55 - yes yes
63:06 - okay people are telling me that the
63:07 - noise is annoying I really I don't think
63:12 - it's an OBS problem because I think it's
63:17 - also in the audio track of the I have
63:22 - another system that records a backup of
63:24 - everything zipper gets close to the mic
63:27 - I mean that doesn't really make sense
63:31 - right I mean that's gonna make have
63:36 - noise but I mean I've done streams
63:44 - without zippers before oh you don't see
63:46 - me right now
63:55 - bum-bum-bum-bum-bum what do I do about
63:57 - this
64:02 - I don't think it's a it's mostly when my
64:07 - hand is near the mic my ring is hand
64:26 - so I'm just I'm taking a pause for a
64:29 - second to figure out if I can sort this
64:34 - out at all I'm trying to think
64:37 - charger what charger though
64:49 - it's interference it's a mugging well
64:52 - yeah it's fine you know I guess just let
64:56 - me know if it was particularly bad the
65:02 - game being too high yeah I have that
65:07 - down I don't think it's feedback though
65:11 - but one thing I can do is just turn off
65:15 - I do let me just let me just check one
65:18 - thing for a second okay
65:20 - it was really bad just now huh people
65:29 - are telling my phone but it's my phone
65:30 - so far away I'm just wondering if I turn
65:34 - the audio monitoring off
65:41 - what's weird I it's interesting because
65:48 - I'm not hearing it the way I think I
65:54 - just heard it yeah I hear it oh yeah I
65:58 - hear it okay
66:10 - playing with the receiver
66:20 - oh yeah okay that is really weird I was
66:31 - able to get it to move such as the
66:32 - coincidence
66:51 - yes you were watching a person and move
66:55 - around trying to figure out if it was a
66:57 - way to trigger the audio interference
67:16 - all right I have an idea I have a I have
67:24 - another laughs Mike let me just try the
67:25 - other laugh Mike which I should done a
67:28 - million years ago so I'm muting myself
67:30 - for a minute
67:34 - [Music]
68:00 - [Music]
68:07 - [Music]
68:37 - [Music]
68:44 - [Music]
68:57 - they test one two three all right I
69:00 - think this mic is working and it doesn't
69:02 - look like it's crazy left so the
69:10 - question is is there interference this
69:13 - is better or worse the same test one two
69:33 - huh I don't hear it too loud
69:37 - okay well that's easy to fix
69:45 - okay that should have turned it down a
69:47 - tiny bit and hopefully the interference
69:53 - will be gone
69:54 - we'll find out okay so if if you hear
70:06 - any audio issues let me know but I'm
70:09 - gonna assume that hopefully fixed it
70:11 - Wow it's 10:40 already I'm gonna be
70:13 - taking a break shortly
70:23 - great I I actually have a third idea of
70:27 - something I could do if it's really bad
70:28 - because I have new wireless headphones
70:32 - and I could wear them and the mic wall
70:36 - it's actually pretty good
70:37 - so but anyway well everybody saying the
70:40 - mic is better I there's exactly the same
70:44 - mics it's just two of them all right
70:50 - okay that was a burp did you pick that
70:55 - up clearly easy to forget you're live
70:59 - streaming and the body just does what
71:01 - the body wants to do
71:08 - [Music]
71:22 - alright I'm gonna move on
71:28 - okay so okay all right all right all
71:42 - right now you're catching up to me in
71:44 - real time I'm gonna move on you know
71:49 - while I took this break just give me a
71:54 - second to check
71:54 - I'm just curious now to see how that
71:56 - recording is going okay now if I could
72:40 - only remember where I left off but here
72:42 - we go
72:49 - now I can see both the mover which isn't
72:51 - moving at all which is what it should be
72:53 - doing and the attractor just as a circle
72:57 - there's a better pic suggestion in the
73:00 - share channel could you repost it here
73:03 - because I not easy for me to check other
73:06 - channels cuz I'm gonna repost it in the
73:09 - live chat supporter group
73:24 - I the problem is you're gonna it's gonna
73:26 - be a while so you hear me say that okay
73:30 - get a move on
73:44 - how's everybody doing today okay we're
73:47 - really feeling okay as things in the
73:49 - world are spiraling everybody take a
73:52 - deep breath relax hug your neighbor a
73:54 - friend all right I'm gonna move on
74:06 - I'm waiting for it to appear but I don't
74:08 - think it's going to
74:09 - oh there it is oh thank you perfect yes
74:13 - that's exactly what I intend to do yes
74:20 - that's a great diagram whoever made that
74:25 - thank you how do I pull that up here
74:31 - hold on a sec
74:50 - hey can someone make money all right I'm
74:58 - moving on thank you for that diagram but
74:59 - I it's I need a better system for all
75:02 - sorts of things move on okay the account
75:06 - that I hopes there's an account that I
75:09 - log into discord on this laptop that's
75:12 - not in the supporter Channel I could
75:14 - have checked share Dirk Harrell six
75:16 - eight seven okay all right
75:26 - everybody I'm moving on
75:41 - okay now I have the mover not yet moving
75:47 - because no force has been activated and
75:49 - the attractor just in the canvas so the
75:52 - next step is for me to write this
75:54 - attract function and implement the
75:56 - formula but before I do so let me
75:58 - address something why did I choose to
76:00 - say a tractor dot attract mover I could
76:03 - have said a number of other things I
76:06 - could have said
76:17 - I could have choked I could have caught
76:21 - up I can't get the momentum back I could
76:27 - have called a function it's gotta be
76:36 - okay everybody here we go I could have
76:39 - called a function on mover instead of a
76:40 - tractor or I could have written a new
76:42 - function that takes the two arguments
76:43 - the mover and a tractor or I could just
76:45 - work out the code in here so I'm making
76:46 - a somewhat arbitrary choice but to me it
76:49 - feels conceptually consistent to have
76:52 - the attractor object itself have the
76:55 - functionality to create a force that
76:57 - attracts the mover object but you know
76:59 - if you want to try to redo it and
77:01 - reorganize your code in another way I
77:03 - would really encourage you to do that
77:04 - and share it with me
77:17 - returning to the diagram for a second
77:19 - you know I did make a sort of slight
77:21 - mistake here which I am calculating a
77:23 - force and I talked about wanting to
77:24 - calculate a direction and a magnitude
77:26 - but this whole why whoa what just
77:31 - happened
77:35 - all right everyone don't worry I have a
77:38 - solution for this
77:51 - apply force to get momentum yeah now I
77:58 - didn't make a sort of small error here
78:00 - or inconsistency where is that I'm
78:01 - saying I'm calculating a vector but all
78:03 - of the variables and aspects of the
78:06 - formula that I'm working with here or
78:07 - just calculating a scalar value the
78:09 - magnitude of that vector so let me be a
78:11 - little bit more clear about this diagram
78:30 - if I have two objects each with a mass
78:34 - and I'm calling this vector or this
78:47 - if I have these two bodies each with a
78:49 - mass Matt this one being the attractor
78:51 - but that doesn't really matter so much
78:52 - and I think of this vector pointing from
78:54 - object 1 to object - as a vector R then
78:59 - the the distance is really the magnitude
79:05 - of that vector squared and then the
79:09 - direction is the unit vector R which I
79:13 - don't really have a lot of room here but
79:15 - I could say
79:27 - which I could write as our with the hat
79:30 - on it so now this formula is more
79:31 - accurate and all I need to do is
79:34 - calculate both in my code is calculate
79:36 - both this unit vector and this equation
79:39 - put them together and apply that force
79:57 - and I'm going to do all of this in a new
80:00 - function called attract that's part of
80:02 - the attractor
80:14 - so let me first get this vector R I'll
80:20 - call it direction and it is the mover
80:25 - sorry it is this position - the movers
80:34 - position we need to say subtract the
80:46 - distance is the magnitude of that vector
80:50 - and actually I'm going to want distance
80:52 - squared so let's make this distance
80:54 - square it is magnitude squared
81:11 - I'm gonna make up just for right now a
81:13 - universal gravitational constant of one
81:15 - so I could really just ignore it but
81:17 - let's keep the variable in there and
81:19 - just set it equal to one and I'll and
81:27 - I'm gonna use the word strength to
81:30 - calculate the magnitude of that force
81:31 - which is this dot mass times mover mass
81:43 - I'm gonna give myself more room here
81:46 - divided by distance squared and also G
81:50 - times that so this right here is exactly
81:54 - the same formula that I have right over
81:58 - here and I just want to take this vector
82:01 - R and set its magnitude to the result of
82:04 - this
82:14 - so and just to be consistent I'm
82:16 - actually going to rename this from
82:18 - direction to force because ultimately
82:20 - I'm going to use this very lips I'm
82:22 - going to use this variable to be the
82:24 - force and then I'll say force set
82:26 - magnitude to that strength and then
82:30 - mover dot apply force force clean this
82:36 - up for a minute and we can see I have
82:44 - all the steps here get a vector that
82:46 - points from the mover to the position
82:51 - remover to the attractor
82:59 - get a vector that points from the mover
83:02 - to the attractor calculate all of the
83:05 - elements to get the magnitude of that
83:07 - vector put it in this variable strength
83:08 - and then set the magnitude of that
83:10 - vector to strength and apply the force I
83:12 - don't know let's run this this what kind
83:14 - of work I think so I'm not seeing
83:22 - anything okay well one thing would be to
83:25 - actually call the function attract hmm
83:36 - stength is not defined alright that must
83:40 - be a mistake that you've all noticed
83:41 - strength with an R
83:46 - [Music]
83:55 - oh oh wait is moving just ever so
84:00 - slightly and snowy this is where having
84:06 - G can really come in handy let's make G
84:10 - 5 and let's make G 50 there we go so I
84:19 - can scale the force relative to that
84:25 - universal gravitational constant but
84:28 - there's actually something else going on
84:30 - here that I think that I would like to
84:31 - fudge
84:48 - while I really would love to stay so
84:52 - true to this formula you are a wonderful
84:55 - formula and I want to stay true to that
84:56 - formula a little bit of wiggle room here
84:59 - because this is this made-up p5 world
85:02 - it's pixels and there's a lot of aspects
85:05 - to what I feeling that I want to create
85:07 - and how it's actually going to behave
85:09 - with this literal formula and one of the
85:11 - like a big element here that's playing a
85:13 - role here is this distance squared do
85:16 - you think about it the amount of pixels
85:18 - apart that these could be could very
85:20 - easily be you know 200 pixels and if
85:23 - they're 200 pixels apart that's going to
85:25 - be um you know dividing by 40,000 which
85:28 - is going to make the strength of the
85:30 - force very very very small so I could
85:32 - increase the mass of everything I could
85:33 - increase G but ultimately something that
85:37 - I might just do is kind of constrain the
85:40 - distance that I'm using in the
85:41 - calculation to a limit so I'm always
85:44 - going to even if there it's farther than
85:46 - 50 pixels away maybe just cat that at 50
85:49 - on the other hand when they're really
85:53 - really close they could actually be in
85:55 - the same spot in which case the distance
85:57 - would be zero which doesn't make any
85:59 - sense in actual reality but could happen
86:02 - here or even if their distance is
86:04 - something like 0.001 pixels apart if I
86:08 - were to square this to have Justin
86:09 - squared and then divide by it I'm gonna
86:11 - make that strength so strong that things
86:13 - could kind of spiral out of control so
86:15 - this isn't it you could really play with
86:16 - and sort of like try a lot of different
86:18 - scenarios but for me right now I'm going
86:20 - to say that whatever that distance is I
86:22 - want to constrain its range when I go
86:25 - and calculate the forces magnitude
86:39 - to do that I'm just going to use the p5
86:41 - constrain function and now I am getting
86:44 - the magnitude squared which I don't love
86:46 - so I'm going to constrain it's between
86:48 - 25 which is 5 squared and 50 squared
86:57 - which is 25 hundred twenty-five hundred
87:00 - people and 50 squared which is 25
87:03 - hundred let's see what happens now
87:34 - I'm just like sitting here all right you
87:38 - know this is like this range is you want
87:40 - to play with it something you know you
87:47 - there's no science to what I'm doing
87:49 - here if it's pitch lately because I've
87:50 - like violating sexual rules of science
87:52 - but this is something that you might
87:53 - these are parameters that you may want
87:55 - to play with based on what it is you're
87:56 - you really want your system to do in
87:58 - this case what I want to see is it
88:00 - actually have it in this case I think I
88:04 - this would be a better demonstration if
88:06 - I give that mover an initial velocity so
88:09 - I am going to do that I'll give it a
88:12 - random one just so we can see different
88:14 - things
88:24 - and it has a bit more of the quality now
88:27 - of a body a body orbiting this attractor
88:32 - it's moving so slow did I have a limit
88:35 - in here No
88:51 - one thing that might actually make sense
88:52 - here is to get rid of this multiplier of
88:54 - mass and actually just give the objects
88:57 - bigger mass so I'm gonna give the
89:01 - objects a mass of 50 each
89:08 - yikes
89:19 - well I guess I let's give them
89:27 - and then let me just multiply it by two
89:34 - oops
89:43 - where did I mess up
89:53 - all right this is what I was kind of
89:55 - looking to see and actually it would be
89:56 - interesting to trace this one thing
89:58 - visually that I think might be
89:59 - interesting to do is trace the pattern
90:01 - over that I can give the background
90:06 - quite a bit of Alpha
90:14 - and we can kind of see the path that
90:17 - it's going in
90:36 - and then even better let me make this an
90:39 - array
91:15 - so now I'm making hope and I'm gonna add
91:18 - this in here now I'm making 10 mover
91:23 - objects oh and I want to give them each
91:25 - at a random location with a random mass
91:28 - so I'm gonna just put 10 out into the
91:30 - canvas
91:31 - I'll make the attractor a little bit
91:33 - bigger with mass and then I have to loop
91:35 - through them all in draw
91:50 - let me give a bit more pixel space to
91:53 - work with here and let's see what this
91:57 - looks like whoa what happened to the
91:59 - mover oh no it's okay let me put the
92:01 - mover in the middle and I think I want
92:09 - to draw the mover a different color to
92:11 - make it more obvious
92:30 - and
92:31 - [Music]
92:41 - I'm gonna make this constraint of the
92:44 - distance even smaller so it's still
92:48 - weighted according to distance but it
92:51 - won't be as extreme and let's see what
92:54 - this takes a look look like so now again
92:55 - have what have I made here I don't
92:57 - really know but what I'm showing you and
93:00 - actually I want there sorry I want the
93:01 - initial velocities to be a bit stronger
93:04 - I think we'll also make this
93:06 - demonstration a little bit nicer
93:16 - there we go so this is what I was more
93:18 - hoping to see so what I'm looking to do
93:22 - here is create a bunch of mover objects
93:24 - that are orbiting and swirling around
93:27 - this one attractor and you could imagine
93:29 - oh what's something interesting that I
93:31 - could do here is that I could actually
93:33 - just right now in just a very quick
93:35 - moment I could say hey you know what the
93:38 - attractors position now if mouse is
93:44 - pressed
94:00 - if the mouse is pressed move the
94:03 - attractor to where the mouse is
94:12 - I'm not sure what that really added but
94:16 - I'm getting somewhere I'm getting a sort
94:18 - of swirling set of bodies all
94:20 - experiencing gravitational attraction to
94:23 - this one attractor in the center the
94:29 - upper limit is too low I think
94:43 - yeah that's all coming next what Armour
94:45 - and Simon are both asking about will
94:48 - shouldn't these objects be attracting
94:49 - each other and also attracting the
94:50 - attractor that's coming next I think you
94:58 - might have confused the naming of mover
95:00 - and attractor where
95:11 - what did I say I was going to do next
95:15 - repulsion group behavior in a wall force
95:17 - okay
95:37 - reduce the trails yeah
95:49 - let me just take out the trails
95:51 - completely
95:57 - and removing the trail this is what I
96:00 - have
96:00 - oh I confused a tractor and mover in my
96:07 - verbal explanation a few times while
96:10 - setting the color and mouse position oh
96:14 - I should put the mover in the center all
96:17 - right let me we'll dub it's over later I
96:19 - should put the attractor in the center I
96:21 - should put the attractor in the center
96:23 - is that how I said it I should put the
96:28 - attractor in the center and I should put
96:34 - the attractor in the center right give
96:36 - it some extra audio
96:50 - this example might actually look a
96:52 - little familiar to you I've got three
96:54 - years ago I did a coding challenge
96:55 - called attraction repulsion where I
96:57 - essentially built exactly this but I had
97:00 - multiple attractor objects and I also
97:02 - was took that attraction formula and
97:06 - multiplied it by negative one to reverse
97:09 - the direction to make it a repulsion
97:11 - force so those are things that I would
97:13 - suggest trying like what would it mean
97:15 - for you to add multiple attractors maybe
97:17 - every time I click the mouse a new
97:19 - attractor is placed in here how could
97:21 - you adjust this with repulsion but what
97:24 - I want to do in the next video is make a
97:26 - couple changes to this one is I want to
97:28 - show you repulsion so I'll do that but I
97:30 - really there's a big flaw here in terms
97:32 - of how the universe works I mean there's
97:35 - there's no flaw in yeah right you need
97:43 - to see that but I just read it to the
97:44 - wall over there because I'm frustrating
97:46 - myself so this is what it looks like
97:56 - without the trails and you can see I
97:57 - kind of like wrapped up this example
97:59 - that I wanted to make and there's a lot
98:00 - that you could play with here
98:01 - incidentally this might look very
98:02 - familiar to you about three years ago I
98:05 - did a coding challenge called attraction
98:06 - and repulsion where I made exactly this
98:09 - the difference was I took it a bit
98:11 - further and this is something you might
98:12 - think about trying on your own now with
98:14 - this as a basis for your example is what
98:16 - if I were to click the mouse and add
98:18 - multiple attractors what if some of
98:20 - those weren't actually attractors at all
98:22 - but repellers how would I make a
98:24 - repulsion force just multiply by
98:26 - negative 1 to reverse the direction so
98:28 - I'm gonna actually do some of that in a
98:30 - follow-up which will be the next video
98:32 - in your playlist here but what I want to
98:35 - look at more closely though that neither
98:37 - of not neither this example or that
98:39 - previous coding challenge addressed is
98:41 - what if I want every mover object to
98:44 - exert a force on every other mover
98:46 - object what if going back to this
98:48 - original diagram right
98:50 - where I'm
98:57 - what if going back to Newton's law of
98:59 - universal attraction every particle
99:02 - attracts every other particle so really
99:05 - there should be a force all of these
99:07 - should be attracting every other one and
99:09 - what does the system look like if I have
99:11 - a lot of bodies floating around all
99:12 - mutually attracting each other so that's
99:15 - what I'm going to focus on in the next
99:17 - video it's a bit of an introduction to a
99:19 - group behavior I might need like a
99:21 - nested loop we'll see
99:22 - and that'll bettle really wrap up this
99:25 - chapter - okay all right I'm gonna take
99:32 - a short break right now and I will come
99:37 - back and finish this off I'm glad we
99:40 - have the audio thing worked out how are
99:41 - there's a lot of people watching this
99:43 - right now which is always mind-blowing
99:44 - to me I need to get some like water but
99:48 - before I take my short break
99:50 - let me a really thank the sponsor of
99:53 - today's livestream - Layne dot - Layne
99:58 - which you can go to at - link calm so
100:02 - what do I say I have a little story to
100:04 - tell go back so I was talking to back to
100:11 - my son again who's now a programming in
100:13 - scratch my daughter is also program at
100:15 - scratch but she's a lot younger so a
100:17 - little bit a little bit harder but she's
100:19 - just doing a great job
100:20 - but I was he has an account that's part
100:25 - of his school and I was asking him oh
100:26 - what's you know like I wanted to see
100:28 - what he was doing I was like oh maybe
100:29 - I'll just log into your account later
100:30 - like do you know your password and he
100:33 - was like yeah I know my past was like
100:34 - well how did you get a password he's
100:36 - like it assigned to you did you make one
100:37 - up there's like oh well I just keep my
100:39 - password in a file on my computer on the
100:42 - computer that he uses for school at
100:44 - school and as well and I thought to
100:46 - myself oh my goodness I am NOT teaching
100:48 - my children proper password management
100:52 - and if you're doing things like all of
100:56 - your passwords are on just like a plain
100:57 - text file sitting on your computer or
101:00 - you have the same password across
101:01 - everything you're using this is not good
101:05 - you know there's lots of things you I
101:08 - that I like to attempt to do
101:10 - my best to sort of like protect accounts
101:12 - and not use and and and so one of the
101:14 - things that I can't live without really
101:15 - is a password manager and what a
101:16 - password manager does dashlane being a
101:19 - great a service password management
101:21 - service is that it allows you to store
101:23 - to have different passwords everywhere
101:25 - everywhere
101:27 - don't don't hurt yourself and and have
101:29 - them all stored in a single place in a
101:32 - secure fashion so and then you know
101:35 - frankly it just makes life like super
101:37 - convenient when I'm trying to order a
101:39 - very expensive copy of a million random
101:42 - number book a regional print on eBay
101:43 - which is what you're seeing me do right
101:44 - now only I can't because I can't find it
101:46 - can I please find it on eBay somebody
101:49 - help me so I could use my dashlane to
101:52 - quickly enter in all my information to
101:53 - buy that expensive random numbers book
101:58 - what else do I want to tell you about
101:59 - dashlane so there's a few things that
102:02 - are important so one thing is - lean is
102:05 - different than other options that you
102:06 - might have already for automatic logins
102:08 - solutions like keychain and krob they
102:10 - lock you into a single system so your
102:12 - passwords and info are trapped in one
102:14 - place sign-on solutions like login with
102:16 - Facebook and misuse your data because
102:18 - they make money from collecting it
102:19 - selling it and using it to annoy you
102:21 - with ads so dashlane ever has access to
102:26 - your personal data and won't trick you
102:28 - into subscribing there's no credit card
102:29 - required at signup not even - Lane can
102:32 - see your data and it's always an ad-free
102:34 - product so really I mean for me this
102:36 - ability like fill in forms fast with
102:38 - one-click logins and autofill you saw me
102:40 - do that with the people I've web editor
102:42 - is just so incredibly convenient it's so
102:44 - nice to have something that I can use
102:46 - across a Mac Mac Windows a mobile device
102:49 - whether it's Android or iPhone and
102:51 - really sort of like respond easily to
102:53 - breaches and hacks with personalized
102:54 - security alerts so if you're interested
102:57 - in giving dashlane a try you can go to -
103:03 - Lane comm slash coding train if you sign
103:05 - up through that link it lets them know
103:07 - you found it from the coding train thank
103:08 - you very much and you'll get 30 days of
103:11 - free premium subscription to all of the
103:13 - features I mean and then if you also if
103:15 - you choose to purchase it after those 30
103:18 - days you'll get a 10% off the premium
103:20 - so I thank you again thank you - Josh
103:24 - lien for being a sponsor it really helps
103:26 - make all the stuff that I'm doing
103:27 - possible and I am going to take a break
103:31 - and come back to this coding example so
103:32 - I think it'll probably be about five
103:34 - minutes I'm just kind of like getting
103:36 - all my various windows back up here and
103:41 - um a few I've benefited I'm gonna do the
103:46 - next part of this I think I'm hope I
103:48 - wanted to get to chapter 3 today we'll
103:50 - see if that happens I've got until about
103:51 - noon so I'll have when I come back in
103:54 - five minutes all about 40 minutes left
103:55 - till like plow through some more
103:56 - examples and stuff thank you for
103:58 - watching and I will see you in about
103:59 - five minutes
104:02 - [Music]
104:28 - [Music]
104:35 - [Music]
105:05 - [Music]
105:12 - [Music]
105:54 - [Music]
107:29 - [Music]
107:39 - [Music]
108:07 - [Music]
108:59 - everyone eat about one more minute so
109:03 - I'm going to set the music back a little
109:04 - bit
109:05 - [Music]
110:25 - [Music]
110:34 - [Music]
111:02 - [Music]
111:25 - okay sorry for the delay of praying
111:32 - alright I've got some water thank you -
111:35 - - Lane as the Kotick train sponsor and
111:39 - also water which keeps me hydrated
111:53 - all right what is next what is next
111:56 - spill the water on the computer
111:59 - everything's gonna be fine like that up
112:03 - and who okay so now I can move this here
112:16 - and this is the last video tutorial I am
112:23 - going to make as part of chapter 2 and I
112:27 - guess chapter three will probably have
112:29 - to wait until another day I mean I could
112:32 - there might be enough time after I'm
112:35 - done with this next demonstration for me
112:38 - to continue into chapter 3 but I sort of
112:42 - feel like I mean if I'm gonna do it
112:45 - would be so much nicer I think in terms
112:49 - of keeping everything together and
112:55 - having a nice flow to the videos for me
112:59 - to do a session that's dedicated to
113:01 - chapter 3 as opposed to like starting it
113:03 - at the tail end of one and then coming
113:05 - back a week later so you know if I have
113:07 - a little extra time I'll answer some
113:08 - questions or talk about something else
113:09 - but I will be here until noon
113:11 - either way hmm okay now we're talking
113:18 - yeah I could just sort of dance around
113:20 - and act ridiculous at a minimum for like
113:22 - the last ten minutes all right
113:37 - I'm gonna save this and duplicate it
113:49 - all right and
113:57 - ready to go okay I don't know why not
114:01 - let's let's let's keep going with this
114:15 - I actually really like this example I am
114:21 - back with one more demonstration and
114:24 - really I this finished
114:30 - wha-wha-wha wha-wha-wha wha-wha-wha
114:34 - wha-wha-wha wha-wha-wha wha-wha-wha-wha
114:44 - one more one more video here in chapter
114:47 - 2 I want to just do a few more things
114:48 - with this example so the previous
114:49 - example I built this sketch where
114:52 - there's a single attractor at the center
114:55 - of the canvas and all these other mover
114:57 - draw objects are experiencing a
114:58 - gravitational force pulling them towards
115:01 - that attractor and all of that happens
115:04 - in this function called attract where I
115:07 - am writing code to realize this
115:11 - particular formula formula for the
115:14 - universal law of attraction but this is
115:21 - not really how the universe works in the
115:23 - sense that there aren't separate
115:25 - attractor entities and separate mover
115:27 - entities so let me take this a step
115:29 - further and have every one of these
115:31 - mover objects I really want to just call
115:33 - them particles but I'm gonna wait until
115:35 - chapter 4 to call things particles but
115:38 - every one of these mover objects
115:39 - attracts every other mover object and
115:42 - I'm gonna get rid of the attractor
115:43 - no more attractor concept whatsoever
116:02 - yeah
116:04 - before I get rid of the attractor but
116:07 - before I do that I let me save this code
116:10 - because I'm gonna want to use this code
116:12 - so I'm gonna take this code and put it
116:15 - actually just in the mover object itself
116:20 - then I'm going to delete this file
116:33 - get rid of the reference in index.html
116:38 - get rid of the attractor here comment
116:44 - this out and get rid of all this nope
116:48 - let's run this sketch and see what
116:50 - happens
116:50 - great all of the mover objects are
116:53 - moving with their initial velocity but
116:55 - there's no other forces
117:10 - now I have a loop here that says for
117:14 - every mover inside of the movers array
117:17 - update and show but what do I also want
117:20 - to do for every mover in the movers
117:22 - array each one of those movers is in a
117:24 - tractor to attract all the other movers
117:27 - so inside of this array while I'm
117:29 - looping through all the movers I want to
117:30 - check every other mover so I can write
117:34 - another loop inside here for let I'm
117:36 - gonna call it other of movers
117:49 - other dot attract mover or mover dot
117:56 - attract other I don't know both would
117:59 - really be the same I think mover dot
118:02 - attract other makes a little more sense
118:04 - update the move or show the mover and
118:07 - that mover then should attract all the
118:09 - other movers there's a big problem with
118:11 - what I've done here but I'm just curious
118:12 - what happens if I run it whoa oh cool it
118:17 - kind of worked what a nice coincidence
118:19 - I'm surprised didn't get any error but
118:22 - there is a there's an issue Emma it
118:24 - nicely just sort of like bypassed this
118:27 - issue and I got no errors or nothing
118:29 - really crazy happened but this
118:32 - particular loop is going through all of
118:34 - the elements of the array oh no so is
118:37 - this one so for every element of the
118:38 - array go through every element of the
118:40 - array I'm saying the same thing a lot I
118:41 - know
118:42 - and so it's technically possible that
118:45 - the mover at some point is going to
118:46 - attempt to attract itself because this
118:49 - given mover will then appear during this
118:52 - loop as well so I want to avoid that and
118:54 - something that I can do is actually
118:56 - check to see if the two objects are
118:58 - equal which is sort of a weird thing am
119:00 - i checking to see what am i checking
119:02 - exactly so
119:15 - this is a little bit of an aside but
119:20 - what's actually stored in a particular
119:23 - variable and we're talking about an
119:24 - object is so if I'm talking about a
119:28 - specific move or object what's stored in
119:31 - that variable is the memory address
119:33 - where all the data for that object is
119:36 - stored so it's kind of like a pointer
119:46 - so we can think of this variable as
119:48 - storing a reference a pointer to some
119:51 - place in the computer's memory where all
119:54 - of the data for that object is stored so
119:59 - if it's stored in an array this mover of
120:02 - the movers array that pointer is moving
120:04 - around and pointing to all the different
120:06 - objects and maybe they're stored
120:07 - continuously etc etc so at some point
120:11 - other will actually be pointing to the
120:15 - same data the same memory address will
120:17 - be in both of these variables so if I
120:19 - check if they're equal it's actually
120:21 - checking if they're both pointing to the
120:23 - same area of memory which is different
120:26 - than if I had something like Val equals
120:29 - 5 you know Val 2 equals 6 and I'm trying
120:33 - to say is Val equal to Val - with a
120:37 - primitive value like a number it's
120:40 - actually checking to see if the actual
120:43 - things stored in memory is equal the
120:45 - data is equal here we're just checking
120:47 - to see am I looking at the same object
120:49 - that was kind of a long-winded
120:54 - explanation don't know if we need it in
120:56 - the video but and maybe that didn't make
120:58 - any sense so I can check right here now
121:05 - as long as other is not equal to mover
121:09 - then the mover can attract the other and
121:14 - the result visually doesn't really look
121:16 - any different but it is but the result
121:23 - visually I don't not really seeing
121:24 - anything majorly different here but I've
121:26 - now protected the system from having
121:31 - that from from a given object attracting
121:34 - itself which I don't want to happen
121:39 - Alvar says I can't believe you explained
121:42 - pointers faster than you explain static
121:43 - functions well that's sort of true but I
121:48 - don't know if I really explained
121:49 - pointers they're just kind of like
121:51 - glossed over it all right
122:10 - I'm going to take this variable G
122:12 - outside of the attract function it's a
122:14 - nice to have this global variable that I
122:17 - can use to just kind of scale the
122:20 - strength of the attraction force across
122:22 - the board we just lower this down to two
122:27 - little little little less frantic
122:50 - one thing you might notice is the system
122:52 - is not very stable as all of these
122:54 - objects are pulling towards each other
122:56 - they're kind of as a group just moving
122:59 - off and out of the canvas and it kind of
123:01 - makes sense that that would happen but
123:02 - what if what I want is to experience
123:04 - this but have everything really stay
123:07 - within the canvas but what if what I
123:15 - want is to sort of experience this same
123:17 - animation the same feeling that I've got
123:19 - with this sketch but not have the stuff
123:21 - just fly off and eventually disappear so
123:23 - there's a few things you might be
123:25 - thinking of that you could try I mean
123:26 - one is I could have a lot mover or
123:28 - tractor in the center that's always
123:30 - attracting everything so that at a
123:33 - certain point maybe a little bit
123:34 - stronger I don't know if it needs to be
123:35 - stronger or not that everything is kept
123:36 - within the canvas I just realized I
123:44 - might have a no-no I have that's fine
123:55 - another option could be to go back and
123:57 - get that edges function that I wrote so
123:59 - every time one of these objects hits the
124:02 - edge it's a hard edge and it reverses
124:03 - its velocity bouncing back on that would
124:07 - be interesting I'd be curious to see
124:08 - what that looks like but I think this is
124:09 - a nice opportunity for us to look at I
124:12 - mean this is quite artificial what I'm
124:13 - gonna introduce here but what if I just
124:15 - created a force that is activated from
124:18 - the edges of the canvas pointing inward
124:22 - and the strength of that force is mapped
124:24 - to how close a given mover object is to
124:27 - that edge
124:40 - so
124:46 - to do that I'm going to reintroduce the
124:48 - edges function
124:59 - I'm trying to have not done this before
125:01 - so I'm like thinking about I mean I've
125:02 - done this with the steering behavior
125:04 - stuff and let me just start with the
125:11 - left edge so I'm gonna say the the
125:14 - difference between of the exposition of
125:18 - which is zero I'm actually just going to
125:21 - look at the exposition of the object and
125:32 - I'm gonna say the strength of this force
125:35 - that I'm being introduced is a map
125:38 - mapping that exposition which goes
125:40 - anywhere from zero to with and of course
125:44 - it could be a negative number but the
125:46 - way I'm gonna do this is going to
125:47 - account for that and when and and when
125:55 - the distance is zero
125:56 - I want that force to be really strong so
125:58 - let's make the magnitude just five
126:00 - arbitrarily and when it's when it's far
126:04 - away I want it to be really weak I think
126:07 - I should only activate this force if
126:09 - it's within a certain distance let's not
126:13 - worry about that right now let's see how
126:14 - it goes and I'm gonna have it zero if
126:16 - it's all the way on the other side and
126:20 - the force itself is a vector that just
126:24 - points to the right so I'm just gonna
126:26 - make a force that points to the right
126:27 - I'm going to do force set magnitude to
126:30 - that strength and then I'm going to
126:32 - apply the force so this is left edge
126:44 - let's call the edges function and let's
126:50 - see what happens when I run this well
126:56 - you can see the whole system is kind of
126:58 - fading off to the right because there's
127:02 - that left edge force that's always in
127:05 - action now let me do this again
127:09 - whoa I don't know what just happened
127:13 - there
127:17 - and
127:23 - so I'm gonna reuse all the same variable
127:26 - names and there's probably a more
127:27 - elegant way of doing this but I'm gonna
127:30 - say right edge and DX equals the width
127:36 - minus that position that's the
127:38 - difference and that also can be the same
127:41 - mapping would apply but the vector
127:43 - should point the other way let's see
127:46 - what happens now okay let's do the top
127:52 - and the bottom
128:47 - okay so I've built this out with all of
128:50 - the edges and there's a lot of redundant
128:52 - code here that could be reduced but
128:53 - let's just see what happens
129:02 - better right not perfect but the system
129:08 - is staying kind of within the bounds of
129:10 - the window now that the strength of
129:12 - those gravitational forces are getting
129:14 - bigger and bigger the accelerations are
129:16 - building up I might want to put a cap on
129:18 - the velocity of the movers also
129:20 - something quite artificial that I'm
129:22 - introducing here but I think this could
129:24 - help
129:25 - so let me limit the velocities to like
129:28 - I'm just gonna I'm gonna give it a
129:29 - pretty large number like ten whoa come
129:36 - back that's weird
129:47 - [Laughter]
129:52 - so what's interesting is that
129:54 - gravitational attraction force is so
129:56 - strong when they get close that they get
129:58 - kind of locked onto each other and you
130:01 - know maybe this limit was sort of like
130:03 - too strong or too harsh or maybe I want
130:06 - to kind of tune in a different way and
130:08 - go back to this attract function to
130:10 - change the way that I'm doing this
130:12 - constraint but I have another idea I
130:19 - think would actually be interesting to
130:20 - see a repulsion force
130:22 - so let's actually just change this to a
130:24 - repulsion force so I could rename this
130:28 - function to repel which maybe would make
130:31 - sense but ultimately really what I just
130:33 - want to do is say force multiply
130:35 - negative one and let's see what happens
130:37 - oh my wall force is terrible I think
130:45 - it's not really working hold on let's
130:49 - take off the attraction from each other
130:54 - yeah okay the wall force is working do I
131:02 - have any typos in there it's not very
131:05 - strong
131:12 - you know lowering the gravitational
131:14 - constant is something I could try also
131:27 - one thing that I could really do to
131:30 - improve this is this five in there is
131:32 - really construe is really controlling
131:34 - the strength of that wall force as it
131:37 - approaches the edge so it would make
131:39 - sense for me to store that like sort of
131:42 - like max strength in a variable then I'm
131:44 - gonna make that 20 just to make it much
131:46 - much stronger right now
131:58 - let's run this again
132:03 - you know this feels tuned properly with
132:06 - the way that I want that edge force
132:07 - there's no attraction or repulsion
132:09 - between them but the walls are keeping
132:13 - them within the window itself let me
132:17 - lower the gravitational constant down to
132:19 - one and turn back on repulsion the
132:23 - repulsion is just still much too strong
132:30 - let me lower that even more but now I
132:38 - don't really see them repelling each
132:40 - other
132:56 - honestly I think one of the issues here
132:58 - is that
133:08 - I think one of the issues here is that
133:10 - force keeping them on that force keeping
133:14 - them within the edges is so strong it's
133:16 - overwhelming the attraction or repulsion
133:18 - force and it's always on like I'm
133:21 - mapping that force the X I'm mapping the
133:23 - force from the edges in any direction
133:25 - wherever it is so what might make more
133:28 - sense is for me to check to see if it's
133:30 - within right only if it's within like 25
133:35 - pixels so maybe we can have like a
133:37 - buffer which is 25 if it's within that
133:40 - buffer then map the force according to
133:48 - that buffer and then only apply it if
133:56 - it's within if it's close to the edge
133:58 - now let me do that for all the other
133:59 - ones
134:25 - whoops
134:31 - so I have that check now in for left
134:34 - right bottom and top I'm going to turn
134:42 - off the attraction or repulsion in this
134:45 - case and run the sketch again so nothing
134:51 - is moving because no object was close
134:56 - enough to the edge to experience the
134:57 - force oh no actually no they're not
134:59 - moving because I have an error strength
135:01 - is not defined mover line 46 oh look at
135:07 - this so actually this is kind of better
135:10 - because I I had these now these
135:12 - variables or local variables to the if
135:14 - statements
135:27 - run this again
135:33 - so they're staying within the canvas and
135:36 - that force is only activated if it's
135:38 - within 25 pixels let's make that 50 then
135:43 - let's make that force much stronger
135:46 - because you know this is much more like
135:48 - a bouncing ball sketch in a way because
135:50 - that force only activates when they get
135:52 - close to the edge and it's very very
135:54 - very strong now I think that I could
135:59 - have the repulsion back in and increase
136:03 - its strength the repulsion is so strong
136:12 - they're all trying to stay very far like
136:14 - from the corners but not what I wanted
136:16 - at all let's let's weaken the repulsion
136:28 - let's go back and make this attraction
136:40 - Oh
136:42 - it's a mover train look at what an
136:45 - interesting little weird thing that I
136:47 - created what if the distance is within a
136:50 - certain threshold they repel each other
136:52 - otherwise they attract each other oh
136:54 - that's an interesting thing I could try
136:56 - I want to go back to just using the raw
137:02 - distance not the distance squared which
137:04 - i think is easier for me to kind of
137:06 - think about so we'll make this between
137:08 - 10 and 50 and then we'll actually say
137:11 - here distance times distance and then
137:18 - I'm gonna say if distance is less than
137:25 - what being constrained is equal is less
137:29 - than 20 make it a repulsion force let's
137:38 - see what happens now
137:43 - so they're all attracted to each other
137:45 - but then when they get close they kind
137:47 - of repel interesting there you can see I
137:57 - could play with this forever and ever
137:59 - and I assume while you're watching this
138:01 - you're like oh whatever you're doing is
138:03 - so silly I have a much more creative and
138:04 - interesting way to make this a dynamic
138:06 - compelling beautiful artistic
138:09 - visualization please go ahead and do
138:12 - that and share it with me I would love
138:14 - to see it there is something that I
138:16 - should point out here which is that I am
138:19 - NOT the warder of the movers is kind of
138:22 - playing a role here in the sense that I
138:29 - am updating their location and then
138:32 - applying a bunch of forces and then
138:34 - update in the next ones location then
138:35 - applying all the forces if I want it to
138:37 - be really much more exact about this I
138:40 - would want all of the movers to
138:42 - accumulate all their forces based on
138:44 - their current position and then all
138:46 - update together so it could actually
138:48 - make sense for me to do that to have two
138:57 - separate loops
139:12 - one where I update and draw them all
139:15 - then I apply a whole bunch of forces
139:17 - based on those fixed positions and then
139:19 - update them all together all at once
139:20 - we'll see if this actually has any
139:22 - different quality to it
139:32 - another aspect of this is I'm not
139:34 - considering anything I'm not considering
139:42 - another aspect of this is I'm another
139:50 - aspect of this what was I gonna say Oh
139:53 - another aspect of this is I'm not
139:55 - treating these as rigid bodies notice
139:57 - how they can easily move over each other
139:58 - I'm not worrying about actual collisions
140:01 - here that would be a whole other complex
140:03 - thing for me to work through and
140:05 - implement and in many cases when I'm
140:07 - doing collisions I end up using a
140:09 - physics library and I have some videos
140:10 - that are will appear in this playlist
140:12 - about that using the library called
140:13 - matter Jas but ultimately I think this
140:16 - really wraps this up this wraps up
140:18 - chapter 2 of the basic idea of looking
140:21 - at the universal laws of motion Newton's
140:24 - laws how those laws of motion can be
140:27 - applied in code not in an accurate
140:30 - perfect way but in a way that reflects
140:33 - the sort of core ideas of them but is
140:35 - easy to implement and runs kind of fast
140:37 - and then what kinds of things do I need
140:39 - to adjust your tweak or sort of fudge to
140:42 - kind of keep to create the simulation or
140:45 - visualization that goes with whatever
140:47 - story or that I'm trying to tell with my
140:50 - sketch and I don't really have a story
140:52 - that I'm trying to tell other than I'm
140:53 - trying to teach how this stuff works and
140:55 - how you could apply it but I hope that
140:57 - you have an idea or a story or a project
140:59 - you're working on where this applies so
141:01 - if you do share it with me
141:03 - final link to the coding train comm page
141:06 - where you can share your work in this
141:08 - video's description you could also join
141:09 - the coding train discord and share your
141:11 - work that way and I look forward to
141:13 - seeing you in chapter 3 where I will get
141:16 - into
141:19 - I hope you're excited I'm really excited
141:23 - and I shouldn't have played that sound
141:25 - effect I should play like a beautiful
141:26 - sound effect like birds singing because
141:30 - trigonometry it's our friend we'll be
141:32 - there together enjoying trigonometry
141:34 - together in the next video this one
141:36 - really has to end now I'm just talking
141:37 - way too much goodbye and see you soon on
141:40 - the coding train oh that was like the
141:49 - worst ending ever yes Lucas writing is
141:57 - this an implementation of G equals m1
141:59 - times m2 bubbeleh
142:01 - so the divided by zero thing is
142:02 - something I really should protect
142:04 - against I should have a check here that
142:07 - says if distance is as long as distance
142:10 - is greater than zero go go forward and
142:12 - multiply but I'm choosing to not bother
142:16 - with that extra error check mostly
142:20 - because it's just not gonna happen with
142:23 - floating point math that these pixel
142:26 - values are going to be exactly the same
142:27 - and then I'm also constraining it Oh
142:30 - actually it's never gonna happen because
142:33 - I'm constraining it to between these two
142:37 - values
142:38 - so I'm actually protecting against that
142:42 - here with this extra constraint that I'm
142:44 - adding all right actually I thought I
142:48 - was gonna have all this extra time which
142:50 - I clearly do not because I only have
142:51 - about ten minutes but ten minutes is
142:53 - actually quite a bit of extra time and
142:54 - maybe people have questions there's are
142:57 - some other things I wanted to mention
142:58 - maybe I should rerecord an aspect of
143:00 - this feel like I was really fumbling
143:02 - towards the end there but it is what it
143:04 - is
143:05 - questions oh there was a super chat from
143:08 - Vito list thank you
143:17 - I'll press my to chew button let's see
143:21 - there's probably people who join now who
143:23 - didn't who weren't here at the beginning
143:25 - of the stream so let's think up let's
143:27 - look at the pi day let's see if anybody
143:28 - added any pi day issues no there's no
143:37 - new ideas for pi day where are you my
143:40 - people let's see what there is
143:43 - previously whoops no no I want to look
143:48 - at pi day ideas generating PI from
143:57 - random numbers I think I did basically
143:59 - that already o co-prime
144:02 - oh yeah the stand-up Mass video okay
144:06 - that's interesting so I haven't done
144:09 - this one the co-prime thing I did the
144:11 - thing the dart throwing one idea I like
144:15 - this that's certainly a possible pilot
144:20 - generator what if I trained a machine
144:25 - learning model with the digits by the
144:27 - generate PI that seems kind of silly a
144:36 - good opportunity to talk about Co
144:38 - Prime's literary nerds invented a
144:41 - dialect known as pylus in which the
144:44 - numbers of letters and successive words
144:46 - match the digits of pi for example my
144:49 - Keith wrote the book not awake entirely
144:52 - in pilus now I fall a tired suburbian
144:56 - and liquid under the trees okay this is
144:58 - kind of Awesome ok pilot this is a this
145:07 - I like I like this idea
145:09 - thumbs up I'm gonna assign myself so
145:13 - that is not at all in the wheelhouse of
145:16 - things I was thinking about but it could
145:18 - absolutely work pi day challenge
145:20 - calculate million digits of pi yeah I
145:23 - don't know how to do that I wrote some
145:26 - code based on somebody else's code based
145:28 - on an algorithm that was doing that
145:31 - pi day challenge 3d monte-carlo
145:36 - approximation of pi by dropping
145:39 - raindrops into or outside a puddle
145:41 - that's very similar to what I did
145:44 - already I didn't do it in 3d a lot of
145:47 - visual flair to it but that's that's an
145:49 - interesting idea
145:52 - oh wait I'm already at that one
145:56 - visualize an infinite series I think I
146:02 - need something more specific
146:03 - I like the suggestion
146:06 - [Music]
146:15 - pi day challenge
146:21 - Audio visualizer okay this I did with
146:26 - Gaussian rather than a circle
146:38 - this is interesting it's a little bit
146:40 - similar to what I did previously I guess
146:50 - I'm a little less interested in pie
146:52 - approximation since I've done that
146:54 - before although this is really an
146:57 - interesting one to see thank you this is
146:59 - a great example del squared this is
147:02 - awesome um
147:08 - a list of pi day challenges pi art
147:13 - countdown to the next pi day oh I like
147:16 - that
147:16 - use pi any object you make use the line
147:21 - function to manually draw the numbers of
147:23 - pi some nice ideas this I did oh I
147:29 - didn't use matter digest this is what I
147:30 - did last year pi music PI rock concert
147:34 - make a sheet of pi music this I really
147:39 - do like the idea but here's the thing
147:42 - when I when when I've done things where
147:44 - I visualize the number the digits of pi
147:46 - there's so much mystery and meaning in
147:49 - those digits but ultimately they're the
147:51 - distribution of them is really just like
147:53 - a bit of a pseudo-random number
147:55 - generator and I know there's more to it
147:57 - than that but I'm I don't know would I
147:59 - get anything melodic are meaningful by
148:02 - assigning the digits of pi to note
148:05 - values so that I think is a really
148:07 - terrific idea that I would like to do it
148:09 - maybe some of you who are musicians or
148:11 - sound artists might have some specific
148:14 - ideas of how I might implement this but
148:18 - I'm going to keep this on my list who
148:23 - ASCII art I know that violet has done
148:27 - work with ASCII art yeah
148:35 - this one especially whoa
148:40 - so I a ski art with the digits of pi
148:43 - that's an interesting idea
148:45 - I'm not I feel like I need a little bit
148:48 - more focus to this you could use PI's
148:51 - decimal development consecutive digit to
148:53 - represent the PI yeah I think I need
148:57 - something that's sort of connecting to
149:02 - connecting to the the sort of like
149:06 - mathematical aspects of Pi themselves I
149:08 - mean I'm making just like a PI is fun
149:13 - all right pipe rot approximation day
149:16 - which is uh 722 right July 22nd which is
149:22 - 22 so now I'll come back so if somebody
149:24 - remind me to do this in July stem coding
149:28 - project p5 just I have done so many PI
149:34 - approximating staying this is this is
149:37 - similar to what I did already
149:39 - um spiral okay you had me at spiral ooh
149:46 - no that's cool this is kind of fun
149:57 - is there something about this that's
149:59 - tied to the math of Pi probably in the
150:02 - sense that you're I'm doing polar to
150:05 - Cartesian coordinates old-school PI
150:10 - demonstrations
150:11 - I like old-school Oh
150:21 - this is super interesting
150:27 - this is actually highly relevant to
150:29 - chapter three of nature of code so I'm
150:33 - gonna consider this one rolling wheel
150:35 - full of paint I like this idea a lot pie
150:42 - is made of pie
150:49 - yeah make a visual image of the
150:51 - character pie made of lots of little pie
150:54 - for you to make the larger character yet
150:56 - so this I could sort of imagine this and
151:03 - that's kind of in the ASCII art
151:05 - territory draw a circle with pine
151:07 - numbers this is a suggestion from Simon
151:13 - Willie oh boy oh boy why are you so
151:23 - these are these are definitely I could
151:24 - consider I think I was looking to do
151:26 - something more visual and less pie
151:28 - approximation II calculate the I don't
151:33 - think this is possible
151:34 - I mean I could I you know I could train
151:37 - gbt to on or like a recurrent neural
151:41 - network on the digits of pi couldn't
151:47 - learn like what I mean that's sort of an
151:50 - interesting idea I I mean I don't think
151:52 - this is gonna work but like I'm gonna
151:54 - like keep this in mind is something that
151:57 - I could do where am I
152:03 - they also need to do a song so I got my
152:07 - ukulele song ideas oh it's noon noon
152:10 - o'clock I got to go search for words in
152:13 - PI this I like oh this I like this I
152:20 - really like okay I'm gonna add that so
152:23 - there's a lot about nice ideas here oh
152:25 - boy there's so many pi city skyline
152:34 - pie-in-the-sky Oh interesting so these
152:38 - are like the digits of pi in a skylight
152:40 - it wants so much nice a nice idea I see
152:43 - there's like it looks like there's a
152:44 - three blue one Brown video being posted
152:50 - okay I think I got to go
152:53 - there's actually quite a bit of all okay
152:56 - yeah yeah these are the original
153:00 - suggestions yeah so I've done stuff like
153:04 - this which I really like but I don't
153:10 - want to just copy somebody else's
153:12 - beautiful art so I would need kind of a
153:15 - a new creative idea but that I have done
153:18 - oh here we go
153:20 - so that's the proof okay so I'm gonna
153:23 - look through these some more thank you
153:26 - for those suggestions someone added a
153:29 - new suggestion
153:35 - I don't know why I'm not seeing oh
153:37 - because it's not doesn't have the label
153:39 - yet so let's label this pi day
153:56 - bake up high I mean I kind of really
154:03 - want to do that I pie day comes at a
154:05 - very difficult time because it's written
154:08 - sort of like the prime like March 14th
154:11 - is like Spring Break for NYU is the week
154:13 - after they were like a week later I have
154:16 - a lot more time to like maybe do
154:18 - something kind of special or have like a
154:20 - hold a stream and it's really busy right
154:22 - now for me so I might have to just do
154:24 - something quick but I might record it in
154:27 - the Cabana although those take a look
154:29 - longer and harder to produce so anyway
154:31 - thank you for all these ideas I'm gonna
154:34 - get going
154:36 - thank you again to dashlane as the
154:39 - sponsor of today's live stream
154:41 - - link comm / coding train will get you
154:44 - a free 30-day trial or in 10% off if you
154:47 - purchase the premium subscription -
154:50 - Elaine is a password manager and cookie
154:52 - hit the cabana and I'll see I'll be back
154:56 - next Thursday so I'm pretty locked in to
154:58 - this Thursday thing I can tell you
155:00 - though that just look at calendar for a
155:05 - second
155:06 - [Music]
155:13 - what month is it
155:15 - [Music]

157:46 - some online classes for NYU using some
157:48 - of these videos learning to code and
157:52 - currently I'm actually teaching the
157:54 - nature of code course which is why I'm
157:56 - focusing on making the videos during
157:58 - these live streams that get edited into
158:00 - a playlist and I've just been really
158:02 - behind but I do do the the playlist is

160:26 - have never coded before alright thank
160:30 - you everyone I am going to say goodbye I
160:33 - will play you out with a bunch of the
