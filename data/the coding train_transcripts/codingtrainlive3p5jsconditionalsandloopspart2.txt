00:03 - okay I'm think I am
00:07 - live hello
00:10 - hello uh volume is working
00:14 - [Music]
00:16 - unfortunately yeah software update hello
00:18 - everybody
00:21 - oh okay um so I want to first uh mention
00:25 - something off the bat I have to like
00:27 - minimize this for a second so I'm having
00:29 - an audio problem
00:31 - uh which is that uh you're hearing this
00:34 - in mono the videos that I'm actually
00:36 - going to record and upload later will
00:38 - come in both the left and right ears but
00:40 - for whatever reason the stream settings
00:42 - I've changed it in a whole bunch of
00:43 - different places I can't get
00:45 - wirecast to take the input I I don't
00:47 - know in Mac OS if I can change the mono
00:49 - input to stereo so I haven't been able
00:50 - to figure it out yet so uh unfortunately
00:53 - if you're watching this live um you will
00:55 - only hear the um mono signal um so I'm
00:59 - going to try to like I already did an
01:01 - hour of videos so I'm like losing a
01:03 - little bit of steam but I'm going to try
01:06 - to uh finish
01:10 - off these videos I want to do one more
01:12 - video about uh conditional
01:16 - logic um in JavaScript P5 I'm going to
01:20 - look at what it means to set a variable
01:23 - to true or
01:24 - false um and um I'm going to look at the
01:29 - mouse is pressed variable uh as well as
01:32 - making up your own variable uh set to
01:35 - true or false and then I'm going to move
01:37 - on and look at loops and drawing things
01:40 - a whole bunch of times that's my plan so
01:44 - I don't know if let me just check if any
01:45 - of you are there uh the latency is still
01:49 - not so great uh hello seven people who
01:52 - are watching now uh hey I caught that uh
01:55 - I caught
01:56 - that let's see um so so I'm going to get
02:00 - started in a second I'm I'm just trying
02:03 - to think
02:05 - of where where I'm going to do this
02:09 - okay thanks antonus okay you guys are
02:12 - beh I I hate that the chat is lagging
02:15 - behind me but it's not that bad okay uh
02:18 - I need a little
02:23 - water little bit of this
02:26 - coffee okay so I'm just about to get
02:29 - going here I'm losing my
02:31 - voice um okay so I think I just got to
02:35 - get this started so let me prepare the
02:37 - first example I want to prepare I'm
02:40 - going to use both of
02:42 - these
02:44 - uh conditionals
02:47 - one conditionals
02:49 - two oh you know what we need uh oh I'm
02:53 - thinking of so many things I got to make
02:55 - some notes uh so I'm thinking of things
02:58 - that the editor needs it needs needs a
03:00 - um the editor need editor
03:03 - needs uh like Windows so you can flip
03:08 - from sketch to sketch and then the
03:12 - editor also needs would be nice to the
03:14 - editor
03:16 - rememberers uh size and location of the
03:23 - code window
03:25 - also okay uh maybe I'll get a fresh
03:28 - marker okay so
03:31 - um if you guys have uh other thoughts
03:34 - about the p5js editor and things that it
03:36 - might need let me know put it in the
03:38 - comments you can file GitHub issues
03:40 - yourself you should thank Sam LaVine and
03:42 - many others too but Sam LaVine has been
03:44 - leading the charge at the editor there's
03:45 - also a web uh P5 editor that's coming
03:48 - down the pipeline that Jason seagull
03:49 - worked on a lot over the summer uh with
03:52 - a lot of help from others as well uh
03:54 - okay but I got to make this video so I'm
03:56 - gon to make one video where I make a
03:58 - Boolean variable that's stops and starts
04:00 - this circle from moving and I'm going to
04:03 - make another one that uh uh that only
04:09 - highlights it if you're clicking on it I
04:13 - think that's what I'm going to do oh
04:18 - boy H this is dangerous okay I'm just
04:21 - GNA do it it's GNA be fine um let me
04:22 - make this uh no no I'm also going to
04:25 - change this to let me just fix a couple
04:27 - things I'm going to make this wck mode
04:31 - Center and I'm going to change this
04:36 - to uh then this has to be where is this
04:40 - if Rec mode is Center and it's at 300200
04:42 - it's at 250 and less than
04:46 - 350 and mouse Y is greater than 150 and
04:52 - mouse Y is less than
04:55 - 250 so
04:57 - now I have a perfect roller over which I
05:00 - will use to start
05:02 - demonstrating okay uh okay I got to
05:04 - start this
05:05 - video and I'm going to start
05:08 - it I'm G to check the chat one more time
05:13 - uh the fact that you can watch is
05:14 - totally amazing seven people are
05:17 - watching this right now but possibly
05:19 - less fewer than that are actually paying
05:23 - attention I don't know what's happening
05:27 - okay okay I just got to start making
05:29 - these vide videos I'm I'm stalling like
05:33 - crazy look at this weird invisible look
05:37 - at my invisible
05:42 - mug this is the strangest thing I have a
05:44 - mug it's in completely
05:47 - invisible it's also just glass and clear
05:49 - but it like when I put it in front of an
05:51 - actual human being you can see it but in
05:53 - front of the green screen just
05:55 - disappears
05:57 - magic okay uh uh here we
06:06 - go
06:08 - um uh I don't know how I'm going to do
06:10 - this okay I'm GNA figure it
06:16 - out wrong one okay here we go
06:20 - again hi so uh I I've I made a couple a
06:24 - bunch of videos about conditional
06:25 - statements and I recall or I thought of
06:28 - during one of them that there sort of a
06:29 - key element here that I think would be
06:31 - worth noting and spending a little bit
06:33 - of time on in its own short little video
06:36 - which I am attempting to make right now
06:37 - I'm trying to be perky because I'm
06:39 - really inside I feel like lying down and
06:41 - taking a nap okay so what is the topic
06:44 - of this video and what I want to talk
06:46 - about is what if you had a variable and
06:49 - instead of assigning the value of that
06:51 - variable to say a number or perhaps a
06:54 - string or perhaps an image these are
06:56 - some things that you may or may not have
06:58 - seen so far what if the value of that
07:01 - variable I'm going to call it like
07:05 - going were equal to True itself or false
07:10 - so in fact this is a data type now as
07:13 - you know anytime you declare a variable
07:15 - you just say VAR and the name of the
07:17 - variable and then it's up to you to
07:19 - assign it a value most of the examples
07:21 - we've seen so far we give those
07:23 - variables numbers numbers are useful
07:25 - they can be used to specify coordinates
07:27 - on the screen sizes of shapes colors red
07:30 - components of a color the transparency
07:31 - of a color numbers generally are being
07:33 - used over and over again everywhere in
07:35 - the code however it can be useful to
07:37 - have your own variable that is either
07:39 - set to true or false now before I get to
07:42 - that one of the reasons why I'm
07:44 - mentioning this to you is there also
07:46 - happens to be a variable built into P5
07:49 - right there are the variables built into
07:51 - P5 that you likely know about Mouse X
07:54 - and mouse y these variables are numbers
07:58 - they hold the coord ordinate as to where
08:00 - the mouse is on the screen but there is
08:02 - also a variable
08:03 - called Mouse is
08:07 - pressed and this particular variable is
08:12 - uh uh its data type is Boolean meaning
08:15 - it's either true or
08:18 - false so this is relevant because why is
08:22 - this relevant this is relevant because
08:24 - sometimes you want to know is the mouse
08:25 - being pressed or is it not now earlier
08:28 - in a previous video at some point in
08:30 - some life where I made this this other
08:32 - video there happened to be a function a
08:34 - function called mous
08:38 - pressed and I stated at the
08:42 - time that this
08:45 - function is an
08:47 - event meaning the code that you write
08:51 - inside this function gets executed
08:53 - instantly the moment the mouse is
08:55 - pressed so why is there a mous pressed
08:58 - event but also a Boolean variable to
09:01 - check whether the mouse is pressed or
09:03 - not and the distinction comes down to
09:06 - the following and this is a really key
09:07 - distinction which is totally built into
09:09 - the way that you live your life and use
09:10 - a computer but you may not have thought
09:12 - about it at such detail because it's
09:14 - kind of like just sort of like inherent
09:16 - way of being but there's a difference
09:18 - between clicking the mouse I want to
09:20 - click the mouse to instigate something
09:22 - versus I want to hold down the mouse to
09:24 - have something happen continuously while
09:26 - I'm holding down the mouse and in
09:28 - essence the Boolean variable is
09:30 - something you want to use when you want
09:32 - to test if the mouse is being held down
09:35 - and the function Mouse pressed is the
09:36 - function you want to use when the mouse
09:38 - for the event the moment is the mouse is
09:40 - being clicked all the stuff that happens
09:42 - after that is it being held down there's
09:44 - also a mouse released function for
09:46 - knowing when it's released but I but I
09:47 - digress so let's look at the distinction
09:49 - between these two and I'm not sure
09:52 - exactly how I'm going to do this but I'm
09:54 - going to go back to the example the
09:55 - rollover example and see if we can kind
09:57 - of play around with this idea of it as a
09:58 - button versus a
10:00 - rollover okay so let's look let's review
10:03 - this example I since the last time you
10:06 - saw this example because in my fantasy
10:07 - world people are just watching these
10:09 - videos one after another in sequence
10:11 - which I don't know if it's true I don't
10:12 - know if anybody's watching I'm doing
10:14 - this anyway you don't have to watch it's
10:16 - just something I do to entertain myself
10:17 - during my day um and so I'm going to hit
10:20 - run this and you can see I did a couple
10:22 - things one is I used this uh function
10:25 - rect mode so now the rectangle is being
10:27 - drawn according to its Center
10:29 - and then I adjusted the coordinates and
10:31 - I added the y-coordinates so this if
10:33 - statement has become very long I'm
10:35 - checking if Mouse X is between the left
10:37 - and right hand side of the rectangle
10:39 - between the top and bottom so you can
10:40 - see this works perfectly Now it only uh
10:43 - it only changes color if the mouse is
10:45 - anywhere within that rectangle so we've
10:47 - got a rollover now what if I wanted to
10:51 - when uh uh when you're inside the
10:55 - circle um uh do something when when the
10:59 - mouse is pressed sorry okay I know what
11:01 - I'm doing here so let's look at that if
11:03 - Mouse is
11:04 - pressed uh variable so I'm going to
11:06 - actually add just a completely separate
11:09 - if
11:10 - statement and I'm going to say if Mouse
11:12 - is pressed background and I actually I
11:15 - think I want to put this yeah put I want
11:18 - to put this um above that one just uh
11:21 - actually it doesn't really matter but
11:22 - I'm going to put it up here just to kind
11:24 - of for a second just to kind of keep it
11:27 - all uh together so look I've added
11:30 - another uh I've added another if
11:32 - statement sorry I lost my train of
11:33 - thought here but everything will come
11:34 - back so if the mouse is pressed change
11:37 - the background so remember this is
11:39 - different than I click the mouse and one
11:41 - thing happens at the event now I'm
11:43 - checking this is the mouse pressed in
11:45 - draw so what I'm trying to do here is
11:47 - check is the user holding down the mouse
11:49 - this is how this is used okay so now if
11:54 - I click the mouse I'm holding it down
11:56 - you can't see here watch this this is
11:57 - going to be a really crazy moment moment
11:59 - for
12:00 - you this is my computer rising in this
12:04 - like mechanical desk thing we this
12:05 - doesn't really help but just show you
12:07 - there's a computer here I'm going to now
12:08 - hold down the mouse it is green I am now
12:12 - letting go it is not
12:14 - green so I have this interaction which
12:17 - is different than uh I click the mouse
12:20 - and it's green forever we're going to
12:22 - have to sort of see how to do that the
12:23 - other thing what I want to do is only
12:25 - actually have this happen when I'm on if
12:28 - I'm on this this uh on this rollover so
12:32 - let's do let's figure that out so it's
12:35 - kind of silly but the way I'm going to
12:36 - do it right now is take this if
12:37 - statement whoa and put it inside this if
12:40 - statement now I probably could figure
12:43 - out a way of joining this with another
12:45 - and but what I'm saying here is look at
12:47 - this look at this this is kind of
12:49 - exciting and different if the mouse let
12:53 - me put this back
12:56 - down uh if the mouse is within in that
12:59 - rectangle and it's pressed change the
13:02 - background but it doesn't matter where
13:03 - it's pressed or not if it's within that
13:04 - rectangle always change the Highlight so
13:07 - we can see the logic
13:09 - here that I now have it's always GNA I
13:11 - always have this roll over it's going to
13:13 - get highlighted as soon as the mouse is
13:15 - over there I could click anywhere around
13:17 - it doesn't change color but now when I
13:18 - click here but only when I'm holding it
13:22 - down okay so now that's using the if
13:27 - Mouse is press
13:29 - what if I wanted this this is kind this
13:31 - is like a button that you hold down it's
13:33 - like if you had a light at home and in
13:35 - order to have the light on you just
13:36 - always had to hold down the button the
13:37 - switch as soon as you left it like
13:39 - turned off so with your light at home
13:41 - you want to press it it goes on you
13:43 - leave you come back later you could
13:44 - press it again now for this to happen we
13:48 - need an entire other kind of we need
13:52 - another variable okay and we need to use
13:54 - the mouse pressed event so we're going
13:55 - to piece these things together so now we
13:57 - have a rollover where you hold down how
13:59 - am I in seven minutes you hold down the
14:01 - mouse it turns the light on what I want
14:03 - to do is press the button turn the light
14:05 - on press the button turn the light off
14:07 - this is kind of like strangely such a
14:09 - simple thing it's a bit of a tricky um a
14:12 - tricky uh interaction problem inter uh
14:15 - tricky programming logic something like
14:16 - that problem let's figure it out okay
14:19 - so
14:22 - ultimately what I want
14:26 - now is to have my own the way to do this
14:29 - is uh is not to use the mouse is pressed
14:32 - variable that has a value that's just
14:34 - built into the operating system into P5
14:37 - into JavaScript into the browser it
14:39 - knows whether the mouse is pressed or
14:40 - not I want to have my own
14:42 - variable I want to have a variable and
14:44 - call it on might be some there might be
14:46 - an issue with using this term on but for
14:49 - now I think it's going to be okay and
14:50 - I'm going to start with on equal to
14:52 - false so when the program first runs the
14:55 - light is off when on is false the light
14:57 - is off and in
15:02 - draw what I essentially want to do is I
15:05 - want to say if
15:08 - on then set the background to some other
15:11 - color
15:13 - otherwise set the background to some
15:15 - other color so this is the idea here if
15:18 - I have my own Boolean variable that's
15:20 - either false or true I can just change
15:23 - the value of that variable somewhere
15:24 - else in the code when I click the mouse
15:27 - turn this to true and the light will
15:28 - always be on then I have to figure out
15:30 - when do I set it back equal to false so
15:32 - let's take a look at uh at doing this
15:35 - with this now in theory I should upload
15:37 - all these code examples somewhere and I
15:38 - got to figure out a way to do that but
15:39 - at the very least what I'm going to do
15:41 - is save project as uh conditionals
15:45 - button and hopefully um that previous
15:48 - one will be saved so I'm gonna um I'm
15:50 - going to take some of this code for a
15:52 - second and just stick it at the bottom
15:56 - and put it in comments because I might
15:57 - might need to refer to it later later so
15:59 - down here we might need to get back this
16:01 - rollover code and maybe we need to look
16:02 - at the if Mouse's press thing again but
16:05 - right now instead what I want to do is
16:07 - just add at the top VAR on equals false
16:12 - and here I want to say if on background
16:17 - a green background otherwise a black
16:20 - background so let's look at that this is
16:23 - just a simple if statement if on
16:26 - otherwise background now I there's
16:28 - actually like I can't believe I didn't
16:29 - even mention this really because we
16:31 - looked at this with Mouse's pressed and
16:32 - we looked at this with um look at on
16:35 - it's just sort of intuitive to me but
16:37 - always before when you had a Boolean
16:40 - expression you needed to have some sort
16:42 - of like relational operator like if
16:45 - Mouse X is greater than 100 here I just
16:48 - said that the whole point of this is
16:50 - this evaluates to true or false is that
16:53 - sort of off the edge or there a bit of
16:54 - glare there but um this evaluates the
16:56 - true or false a variable with type
16:58 - Boolean you don't need to check anything
17:01 - about it it inherent it itself just has
17:03 - the value true or false it evaluates the
17:06 - true or false that's what it that's its
17:07 - whole purpose in life you could
17:10 - technically say this you could say if
17:13 - on equals true and this would be the
17:18 - same thing like if on has the value true
17:21 - but this is redundant so this might
17:23 - actually help you to sort of think about
17:24 - it because this is really what's going
17:25 - on but codewise it's a little bit
17:27 - shorter to just write if on and then
17:30 - open curly bracket okay so now I'm
17:33 - coming back over here and we see that
17:35 - now if on green otherwise black so I'm
17:38 - going to run this you can see there's no
17:42 - green because on is set to false and I'm
17:43 - not setting it to True anywhere now if
17:46 - on is set to true I'm going to hardcode
17:48 - that now the background is green because
17:51 - on is true so this code is being
17:53 - executed so now the difference between
17:56 - wanting to do something when the Mouse
17:58 - is held down versus instigated event the
18:01 - moment the mouse is clicked is I need to
18:05 - add function Mouse pressed so instead of
18:10 - before remember with the holding down
18:12 - the mouse I had this if Mouse pressed
18:13 - and draw now I want to have this event
18:16 - and what I can't do I don't want to put
18:18 - draw the green background here right
18:20 - remember draw is always looping so
18:22 - drawing code here in this case doesn't
18:24 - really make sense because it we just get
18:25 - overwritten by what happens in draw what
18:27 - I want to do is change the state of the
18:30 - program how do I change the state of the
18:32 - program well on starts as false that's
18:35 - its initial value and when I run the
18:37 - program it's false it's black what I
18:39 - want to do is say when I click the mouse
18:42 - set on equal to true or on equals
18:48 - true so
18:50 - now on equals true let's click the mouse
18:54 - Tada it's on click the mouse again it
18:56 - didn't turn off also
19:00 - when I run this again I can click out
19:01 - here it turns to on so how do I get it
19:04 - only to turn to on if I'm within the
19:07 - bounds of that rectangle well that's an
19:09 - easy thing that's why I saved this code
19:11 - we can now inside Mouse
19:15 - press
19:16 - test for uh oops we can test for the
19:23 - location so the thing that I've added
19:25 - right here is now when the mouse is
19:27 - pressed first check to see where the
19:29 - mouse is and only if it's within that
19:31 - rectangle set it equal to on so let's
19:33 - run this again okay I'm clicking all
19:36 - around the outside nothing's happening
19:38 - now I'm going to click in the center
19:39 - here it comes it turns on now I want it
19:42 - to turn off so this is a tricky
19:45 - one if it's on if it's true it should go
19:49 - off otherwise if it's off it should
19:52 - become I already confused myself we want
19:54 - it to toggle it State true becomes false
19:57 - false becomes true true becomes false
19:58 - false becomes true and I could actually
20:01 - type this out I could diagram this for
20:03 - you but I'm just going to kind of type
20:04 - it out I'm going to
20:06 - say if on is true on should be false
20:12 - otherwise on should be true now this is
20:15 - kind of like oh the camera shut off here
20:17 - I'm turning it back on uh so this is
20:20 - definitely is like a point of confusion
20:22 - now the camera turn off I don't need to
20:23 - go over there anymore this is definitely
20:25 - a point of confusion It's Tricky like uh
20:28 - of like very circular weird logic but
20:29 - think about it if it's on turn it off
20:32 - otherwise it must have been off so turn
20:34 - it on so let's see if that
20:38 - works yay so now I have this button
20:41 - every time I press it I change the state
20:43 - of the program pretty exciting now this
20:46 - however can be condensed all into one
20:48 - line of code and it involves an operator
20:51 - that I this is perfect because I was
20:53 - like what operator did I forget the not
20:55 - operator is something that I forgot so
20:57 - let me I do need to come over here so I
20:59 - need to turn this camera back on uh so I
21:02 - want to look here at the not
21:08 - operator so we know that I could say
21:12 - something like if Mouse X is greater
21:16 - than 100 do something and I could invert
21:19 - this like the opposite of it's greater
21:21 - than 100 would be kind of like less than
21:23 - or equal to 100 but I can also say if
21:27 - it's not not true that it's greater than
21:29 - 100 do something and the not
21:33 - operator is an exclamation
21:36 - point so for
21:40 - example
21:42 - if not on what does this mean do
21:47 - something so I have a variable on it's
21:50 - equal to
21:52 - false does this code get executed yes or
21:56 - no not false is true so this expression
22:01 - together evaluates to True therefore
22:03 - this code does get U does get
22:06 - evaluated
22:07 - so let me make another statement to you
22:10 - and this is like we really this is like
22:13 - very uncomfortable here we're going to
22:15 - do it on equals not
22:19 - on what does that mean I want to set the
22:22 - value of this variable to not itself so
22:26 - if its value is false not not false is
22:28 - true if its value is true not true is
22:31 - false so this much like we had that
22:35 - expression speed equals speed * -1 this
22:41 - reversed the polarity of a number 3
22:43 - becomes neg3 neg3 becomes three take a
22:46 - number multiply by negative 1 makes a
22:47 - negative positive a positive negative
22:50 - this expression takes a Boolean value
22:52 - makes false true or true false so if I
22:55 - come back over here and look at this I
22:58 - could take all of this right here which
23:01 - has this effect of toggling the Boolean
23:02 - variable and I could just change it to
23:05 - one line of code uh equals not on and
23:09 - I'm going to run
23:11 - this the light goes on and off I've got
23:13 - a button I can click outside and nothing
23:15 - happens I click inside now we lost our
23:17 - little rollover so I'm going to also add
23:20 - that back in which is just about
23:23 - highlighting the
23:26 - color
23:29 - and uh so uh we don't need the mouse's
23:33 - pressed part anymore sorry and so all
23:35 - we're doing here
23:37 - sorry is I wanted to add in also so
23:40 - notice if I want to check is the mouse
23:43 - over it continuously that's something I
23:45 - need to do in draw but at the moment the
23:48 - mouse is pressed I also need to check is
23:50 - the mouse over it for the button so this
23:53 - is now has the functionality of if I'm
23:56 - over it it's highlighted but only if I
23:58 - click does that button engage so I have
24:01 - a couple things to say about this number
24:03 - one is anytime you notice two pieces of
24:07 - code in your program that are basically
24:09 - identical you should ask yourself the
24:11 - question is there a better way to do
24:13 - this now we haven't we need to get
24:14 - further down the road here but maybe
24:16 - there's a way we could create our own
24:18 - function that tested if a if the mouse
24:21 - is over a given point and we kind of can
24:23 - do that in two places without have copy
24:25 - and pasting the same code that's
24:26 - something we're going to see later that
24:28 - I'm going to show you later the other
24:29 - thing to think about here that's super
24:31 - interesting again I think it's a point
24:32 - that I started with is we just I just
24:34 - spent uh oh my God this is 20 minutes
24:37 - this video crazy 20 minutes just looking
24:39 - at how to like make a button to have you
24:43 - know roll over versus a button and
24:45 - what's interesting about working in P5
24:46 - and in the browser is later and as I get
24:49 - to further topics I would like to show
24:51 - you how you can add buttons and
24:53 - interface elements that you get
24:54 - essentially for free that are part of
24:56 - the Native browser environment ments
24:58 - they're HTML elements they're elements
25:00 - that you can add to a web page with a
25:02 - little bit of actually code in P5 will
25:05 - let you just create one and you can kind
25:06 - of hook different events and the the P5
25:09 - is going to take care of a lot of this
25:10 - is the mouse over it or did the mouse
25:12 - press it that type of thing but I think
25:14 - there's a moment here as you're just
25:15 - starting out programming working in the
25:17 - raw canvas that it's worthwhile to try
25:19 - to program some of these button and
25:20 - rollover uh kind of elements and it's
25:23 - just good practice and kind of gets you
25:25 - working with all this logic stuff and
25:27 - it'll be interesting to compare to it
25:28 - later so I would say if you're trying to
25:29 - think of an exercise of piggyback off of
25:31 - this is you might have some stuff try
25:34 - have ADD putting this kind of button on
25:35 - a sketch where there's something moving
25:36 - around the screen and when you press the
25:38 - button can you make the like thing move
25:40 - in a different direction or change its
25:41 - size or what kind of other types of
25:43 - things can you hook into like a button
25:45 - like this besides just changing the
25:47 - background color okay hopefully that was
25:49 - useful to you I am now going to stop
25:51 - this video and I'm going to move on to
25:53 - making some videos about
25:56 - loops stop recording here we go okay now
26:01 - uh live
26:02 - stream I'm just talking to you now uh
26:05 - going to
26:05 - [Music]
26:07 - see uh yes
26:12 - uh
26:15 - shoot oh
26:19 - great oh
26:22 - interesting the audio is in Stereo but
26:24 - it's
26:26 - bad oh well so this video probably needs
26:29 - to be
26:30 - re-recorded I can't I don't look at the
26:32 - chat during it which is too bad is the
26:34 - so wait a second I just want to debug
26:36 - this for a little bit unfortunately you
26:37 - guys are behind me
26:40 - um the audio is bad now oh yeah look at
26:44 - that uh it's going back and forth what
26:47 - did I do
26:48 - G
26:53 - shoot
26:55 - ah never change the
26:59 - settings uh
27:03 - okay uh
27:05 - shoot I don't know what I
27:08 - changed uh show Source settings darn it
27:13 - h did I switch this I don't think
27:21 - so silly wirecast I'm using
27:24 - o hey you guys can't see me sorry
27:28 - um I'm G to try to let me hold
27:31 - on uh oh green screen oh no I've really
27:36 - messed things
27:38 - up ah what's going on oh no no no this
27:42 - is the Whiteboard okay um
27:45 - and audio audio audio
27:48 - audio I didn't change anything test test
27:55 - test this is like
27:59 - this is changing the
28:00 - sensitivity test test
28:03 - test where did I change the like did I
28:07 - click on something
28:11 - [Music]
28:17 - here uh oh
28:25 - boy uh
29:11 - test
29:13 - test okay
29:21 - uh hi everyone uh the audio is just all
29:25 - screwed up so I'm going to unfortunately
29:27 - stop this
29:28 - broadcast um and I might restart another
29:30 - one if I can figure it out okay because
29:33 - I I don't want to sit here and debug
29:35 - this live sorry um thank you guys for
29:39 - tolerating this unfortunately I'm going
29:40 - to have to uh re-record that video it
29:42 - seems like just too
29:44 - bad how do I stop this uh stop streaming
29:49 - okay
