00:04 - hi we're going to talk about fractals
00:06 - today fractals what is a fractal okay
00:09 - let's for a moment um think about the
00:13 - think about back in time sometime in
00:15 - your life where you were sitting at a
00:17 - chair with a little desk in front of it
00:19 - and you were studying geometry middle
00:21 - school high school last week who knows
00:24 - you were learning about circles and
00:26 - polygons and rectangles and lines and
00:28 - the relationships between angles and
00:30 - triangles and sides of shapes all this
00:32 - stuff very important very interesting
00:35 - but now let's think about and so let's
00:37 - think about those shapes that you
00:38 - learned in geometry and how they might
00:40 - describe things we find in our world
00:42 - okay so over here I have the top of a
00:45 - cup of tea and maybe you're would say to
00:47 - yourself that looks I mean you can't
00:48 - really see look it disappears with the
00:49 - white but I can put it right here it
00:51 - looks just like a circle and over here I
00:54 - have this eraser and if I look at this
00:56 - eraser it's rectangular so to some
00:58 - extent these idealized forms these ukian
01:02 - GE geometrical shapes can describe the
01:05 - world we live in I'm staring at this
01:07 - camera it's also very circular and
01:08 - rectangular but think about nature and I
01:11 - have this I don't know if this is going
01:13 - to work but think about nature look at
01:14 - these clouds and I don't know look at
01:17 - these crazy coastlines and these U this
01:19 - sea shell thing and the waves of the
01:21 - water and look at these trees and look
01:22 - at all the lightning and all this stuff
01:24 - and this man is talking about fractals
01:27 - this is by the way is from PBS hunting
01:29 - the hidden dimension I highly recommend
01:30 - you watch that if you want to kind of
01:31 - dive deeper into fractal stuff think
01:33 - about all that stuff that worked
01:36 - perfectly just the way I imagine these
01:39 - are not shapes that we can describe with
01:41 - UK idealized ukan forms we can't
01:44 - describe a lightning bolt I mean maybe
01:45 - it's a series of connected lines but the
01:47 - overall quality of the shape mountains
01:50 - coastlines lightning bolts these are
01:52 - things we need a new type of geometry to
01:56 - describe and it's not so new but it was
01:57 - new in 1975 not actually it wasn't n
02:00 - really new in 1975 the fractals have
02:02 - been around for a very very long time
02:04 - but the term fractal came about in
02:07 - 1975 with the publication of this book I
02:10 - mean you know condensing history there
02:13 - I'm sure there the term came before the
02:14 - book but um the fractal geometry of
02:16 - nature by Ben benoa Mandel BR who coined
02:20 - the term fractal and I'm sure many of
02:22 - you have seen the mandal BR set which is
02:24 - a very very famous fractal um shape I
02:27 - don't have a prepared image to show you
02:29 - but um so what I'm talking in circles
02:33 - here what we want to do today is look at
02:37 - what is this thing called a fractal that
02:39 - describes somehow the these shapes that
02:42 - appear in nature and if we could
02:44 - understand what a fractal is then could
02:45 - we write code to implement algorithms
02:48 - behind that would generate fractal
02:50 - patterns that's what we're going to do
02:52 - today it's very exciting so um let's
02:55 - think so let's I want to define the term
02:57 - fractal a little bit more formally
02:59 - perhaps so a fractal is a shape that
03:03 - when broken into parts right fractal
03:06 - from the Latin fractus meaning broken a
03:08 - shape that when broken into Parts the
03:11 - parts look like a copy of the whole
03:13 - shape now what does that mean exactly so
03:16 - a very common scenario which we'll
03:17 - actually make a processing example that
03:18 - implements in a later video is a tree so
03:21 - let's say I draw a line here and then I
03:23 - connect that line with two other lines
03:25 - and each of those two lines I connect
03:26 - with two other lines and each of those
03:27 - two lines I connect with other two other
03:29 - lines I'm like all these lines a little
03:30 - bit shorter every time I do it and I
03:33 - could sit here all day and I would be a
03:35 - very happy person actually just but I
03:36 - think I'll takeing up too much time in
03:38 - this video so I'll stop but you can see
03:40 - here even though I barely scratched the
03:42 - surface of how many times I can keep
03:43 - connecting these lines if I grab this
03:47 - particular branch and bring it down here
03:50 - and kind of rotate it so it faces up
03:53 - what do I have here I have this shape
03:56 - which is essentially the same as the
03:57 - bigger shape we started with this is is
03:59 - the concept of self-
04:02 - similarity very the sort of key quality
04:05 - of fractals fractals are self-similar
04:08 - meaning the parts of the shape look like
04:10 - the whole shape and here we have an
04:12 - exact copy of the whole shape inside the
04:14 - part which is an important distinction
04:16 - this is a sort of exact
04:19 - fractal um one thing I should point out
04:21 - though that self similarity isn't just
04:23 - enough to make a
04:25 - fractal there is a self-similar shape if
04:28 - I take a part of that shape this little
04:30 - line segment and zoom in on it it looks
04:32 - like the original line but this shape
04:34 - doesn't have I would say which is a sort
04:36 - of important thing a kind of fine
04:39 - structure at small scales so this is an
04:41 - important principle of fractals that
04:43 - self- similarity isn't just enough but I
04:46 - want to return back to this idea that
04:47 - this was an exact fractal let's take
04:49 - another
04:52 - scenario now this isn't a shape in
04:55 - nature exactly but let me let me let me
04:57 - um pose this scenario okay I'm going to
05:00 - draw for you because I have this I I I
05:02 - was I've been checking the stock market
05:03 - a lot recently not at all but um let's
05:05 - say we pick a company Apple and we're
05:07 - going to draw the price of Apple stock
05:10 - this is what's been happening to Apple
05:11 - stock maybe it's been going down
05:12 - recently there we go this is a graph of
05:16 - Apple stock now let me ask the question
05:19 - over what time over what time period
05:21 - have I graphed here is this a week a
05:24 - month 10 years a day a minute a second
05:27 - you know trades happen very quickly we
05:28 - don't know the answer to that because
05:31 - let's just say for a second I said this
05:33 - was one year what if I were to go and
05:35 - grab this section which is maybe let's
05:38 - say one month and zoom in on
05:41 - it maybe we might have something that
05:44 - looks like this the parts at at any
05:47 - level of Zoom the shape has the same
05:50 - quality to it now this though is not
05:52 - exact right the pattern that's zoomed in
05:55 - on this part of this time period of the
05:57 - Apple stock is not the exact the one one
05:59 - month shape is not exactly one year but
06:01 - it has the same quality and this is
06:03 - often referred to as a
06:05 - stochastic fractal and the the quality
06:08 - of the shape is kind of has a a random
06:11 - or probab probability component to it so
06:13 - this is an important distinction as we
06:15 - look at different algorithms for
06:16 - generating fractals and making things
06:18 - look natural to what extent do we want
06:20 - kind of exact copies or copies that
06:23 - approximate the whole with some kind of
06:25 - range of probability so um okay so these
06:29 - are the these are uh two important um
06:33 - aspects of a fractal but the key thing
06:38 - the key element that I have not
06:39 - mentioned which will lead us to this
06:42 - path of making all these processing
06:43 - examples that are going to be wonderful
06:45 - is the concept of recursion fractals
06:49 - have are generated from a
06:53 - recursive
06:56 - definition now the idea of of recursion
07:00 - is a beautiful and
07:02 - elegant thing when we implement it it
07:05 - makes our code so short and it's so
07:07 - elegant looking and it creates this
07:08 - beautiful pattern but it's a weird thing
07:10 - and it's a thing that doesn't
07:11 - immediately make sense to us and I want
07:14 - to look uh first at a kind of just pure
07:17 - mathematical scenario where a
07:19 - mathematical concept is defined through
07:21 - recursion recursion means a a function a
07:25 - recursive function is a function that
07:27 - uses itself in its own definition it's
07:30 - it's like saying hi it's like very warm
07:33 - under these lights and people ask well
07:34 - what does it mean for it to be warm and
07:36 - I say oh the definition of warm is the
07:38 - feeling you have when you feel warm
07:40 - that's probably a terrible example for
07:42 - all sorts of linguistic reasons but I'm
07:44 - using the term warm in my definition of
07:46 - the of the term worm worm which seems
07:49 - like a crazy thing that you shouldn't be
07:50 - able to do but in math and in
07:52 - programming this is actually something
07:54 - you you should be doing it's wonderful
07:57 - okay so what let's look at the classic
08:00 - scenario is factorial and I think we're
08:02 - going to look at this we're going to end
08:04 - this video and start to look at
08:05 - recursion in code next okay so let's
08:08 - look at um factorial so uh if you don't
08:11 - remember what factorial is let's just
08:13 - say for a moment right five factorial 5
08:16 - factorial equal 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 we
08:22 - multiply the number five times every
08:25 - number that come that is that that is
08:27 - less than five all the way down to one
08:29 - right okay so now let's look at what
08:31 - four factorial is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 oh
08:36 - interesting look this is the same as
08:39 - this right those match so I could
08:42 - actually say 5 factorial equals 5 * 4
08:47 - factorial interesting which actually
08:50 - means I could say the factorial of any
08:53 - number n equals n * the number n -1
08:58 - factorial faal look at this this is it's
09:02 - crazy this is the definition of
09:04 - factorial the definition of factorial is
09:06 - n factorial equals the number n * nus
09:09 - one factorial have we really said what
09:10 - factorial is here I mean it looks kind
09:12 - of like we have it but we have actually
09:15 - because if we play this out more then
09:17 - we're saying ah well you know what this
09:18 - really means 5 factorial = 5 * 4 * 3
09:22 - factorial which means 5 factorial is 5 *
09:24 - 4 * 3 * 2 factorial which is 5 * 4 * 3 *
09:28 - 2 * 1 1 factorial and actually we need
09:31 - to add something to this definition 1
09:34 - factorial equal 1 and in a way this is
09:38 - our exit
09:40 - condition now I mean exit condition I'm
09:43 - using the term exit condition because
09:45 - we're about to program this stuff and
09:47 - one of the things we're going to see
09:48 - with a recursive definition is it's
09:50 - something like a loop right you could
09:52 - imagine write the code this is your
09:54 - exercise write the code to define the
09:58 - function factorial
09:59 - int
10:02 - factorial int n oh I'm kind of ran out
10:06 - of space there you need to return the
10:09 - answer well you could probably do this
10:12 - fairly easily with a loop a for Loop
10:14 - right what I mean 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 and
10:19 - you know I equals 5 I is greater than um
10:22 - Z iusus the result equals uh the result
10:27 - time I right you could imagine some
10:29 - where you say 5 * 5 - 1 * 5 - 2 * 5 - 3
10:33 - right you have this Loop that's doing
10:34 - that try to do it with recursion a loop
10:37 - has an exit condition when I gets down
10:39 - to one stop looping the recursive
10:42 - definition where factorial is defined
10:44 - according to itself you call itself
10:46 - which calls itself which calls itself
10:48 - which calls itself that has to stop at
10:50 - some point not in theoretical fantasy
10:52 - land where we make fractal that go on
10:53 - for Infinity which is an important
10:55 - question but in real life programming
10:58 - world where we we have discret finite
11:00 - things we have to have an exit condition
11:03 - so this is what this is the principle by
11:06 - which we are going to generate fractal
11:08 - patterns instead of thinking in terms of
11:10 - numbers which is probably you know
11:12 - somebody would probably tell me I can't
11:14 - believe you started without visual
11:15 - imagery people need to learn visually so
11:17 - I don't know but um this is a nice
11:20 - scenario with numbers we're going to
11:21 - look what does it mean when we have a
11:23 - function which draws something which is
11:25 - defined according to drawing something
11:27 - so that's what we're going to do in the
11:29 - next video I had to open the window very
11:31 - hot I don't know if you hear the sounds
11:33 - of the street but um um but before we
11:35 - get to that video Try um doing this try
11:37 - writing the code for factorial and see
11:39 - how far you get and obviously there's an
11:40 - answer in the repository and I'll link
11:42 - to that below as well
11:47 - okay
