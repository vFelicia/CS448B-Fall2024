00:01 - hello there's a siren don't worry it's I
00:05 - don't think it's coming for me although
00:06 - sometime I feel a little bit hot maybe I
00:09 - need some medical attention anyway but
00:12 - I'm here too and making a video this is
00:16 - a really this is like a really good
00:17 - topic and I totally like started talking
00:19 - about a siren but here's the here's the
00:21 - here's a scenario this scenario will
00:23 - come up for you in your life if you
00:25 - choose to make things that happen in a
00:27 - web-browser let's say you have this page
00:31 - that you have designed and it has a
00:34 - whole lot of content on it harab pages
00:40 - and pages of paragraphs paragraphs
00:41 - paragraphs and everything I'm saying we
00:43 - do with any kind of Dom element and
00:45 - maybe we'll add some other kinds of Dom
00:47 - elements to an example that we make but
00:48 - the point of what I'm saying is you have
00:50 - a lot of things on the page and let's
00:53 - say what you want to do is whenever you
00:55 - take your mouse and you hover over one
00:58 - of those elements it is highlighted in
01:01 - some way so in the previous videos we
01:06 - looked at how you could use this
01:08 - function called select all to somehow
01:12 - gain access to all of those elements by
01:15 - a particular tag or a sub selection of
01:18 - those elements by a particular class now
01:20 - one thing I think I should clarify which
01:22 - someone asked to me in the time between
01:24 - I was making these videos is where does
01:26 - this function come from is that part of
01:28 - JavaScript or what so as with just about
01:30 - everything I'm showing you I'm using the
01:33 - p5.js Dom library but all the p5.js Dom
01:38 - library is doing for you is calling a
01:40 - bunch of native JavaScript functions for
01:42 - you behind the scenes so this is the
01:44 - kind of thing you could do with p5.js
01:46 - you could do it without p5.js you would
01:49 - just need a different function it would
01:50 - be like document get elements by tag or
01:55 - query selector all sort of the more
01:57 - longer winded syntax and you might need
02:00 - that someday when you are looking to do
02:03 - something that's not part of p5 and I'll
02:05 - get to that in a video at some point too
02:06 - because that seems like an important
02:08 - topic there's also other JavaScript
02:10 - frameworks like jQuery that have all
02:12 - sorts of silly
02:13 - big functionality built into it but I
02:14 - like this thing called p5 that's what
02:16 - I'm using and so that's that so that's
02:20 - where this comes from now back to the
02:22 - problem at hand so what I want to do is
02:25 - be able to say let me select all those
02:27 - elements maybe by paragraph tag then I
02:31 - have this array of all of those elements
02:34 - and I want to assign those elements and
02:37 - event I'll call that event highlight now
02:44 - if there are three paragraphs I might be
02:47 - able to create a highlight one function
02:49 - and a highlight to function and
02:51 - highlight three function and I could
02:52 - just assign this paragraph this function
02:55 - and the other paragraph highlight two
02:56 - and the other paragraph highlight three
02:57 - but that's really inconvenient I mean if
03:00 - all of them should just highlight that
03:02 - particular paragraph why can't I just
03:04 - give this one function as an event to
03:07 - all of those paragraphs so what I want
03:09 - to do is start building this in code and
03:12 - look at the problem that arise and look
03:14 - at the solution to that problem oh this
03:17 - is good I'm excited okay so here is the
03:24 - example of that I left with in a
03:26 - previous video and you can see in this
03:29 - particular example there are a whole
03:31 - bunch of paragraphs now those paragraphs
03:33 - they're all paragraphs some of them are
03:35 - members of a certain class and one of
03:37 - them happens to have a particular ID so
03:39 - let's start with the one with the
03:41 - particular ID so the first thing I want
03:46 - to do is I'm gonna say I'm gonna have
03:48 - this paragraph variable and I'm gonna
03:53 - comment out this select all part for a
03:55 - second and I'm selecting the paragraph
03:57 - that has the ID unicorn and I'm saying
03:59 - paragraph dot mouse over I'll say
04:02 - highlight and I'll call this function
04:05 - highlight and let's and let's also add
04:09 - in that function let's add a little
04:12 - padding to it this like kind of obsessed
04:15 - with padding and I have this like song
04:17 - about padding that I'm working on you
04:20 - might know about you might have heard it
04:21 - it was in a previous video
04:24 - and then I'm gonna make a function
04:26 - called I don't know unhighlight which
04:29 - gets rid of the padding and sets the
04:32 - background back to white so right I have
04:35 - a function that takes that paragraph
04:36 - gives it padding enough nice color and
04:38 - another function that gets rid of the
04:40 - padding and gives it a background of
04:43 - white so mouse-over highlight Mouse out
04:50 - unhighlight so let's run this and see
04:53 - where is that oh this is the paragraph
04:56 - that I'm working with a unicorn and
04:58 - rainbows what happened undefined is not
05:03 - a function hmm
05:05 - line 20 paris oh look at this what is
05:08 - what nonsense am i typing I'm just like
05:10 - making up code wouldn't that be nice so
05:13 - this would be an interesting feature 55
05:15 - library but it doesn't exist what am I
05:17 - doing here those of you are probably
05:18 - yelling at me or watching this video
05:19 - what I want to do is call the style
05:21 - function and a prop a property of style
05:28 - in CSS that you can add is padding with
05:31 - a certain amount of padding there's no
05:33 - padding function have to call the style
05:34 - function apply padding with a given
05:36 - value okay so now that I fixed that
05:38 - weird error that I made we could run
05:40 - this and we could see here my mouse over
05:43 - none of these other paragraphs but look
05:44 - at this it highlights it's highlighting
05:46 - so this is like highlighting a paragraph
05:48 - as I move the mouse over it
05:49 - so that works only for this one
05:52 - particular paragraph now what if I were
05:57 - to say AHA I can use paragraphs right I
06:02 - can say I want an array of paragraphs by
06:05 - selecting all of the paragraphs and now
06:08 - I want to have a loop of all the
06:11 - paragraphs and I want to do the same
06:12 - thing mouse over highlight mouse out
06:23 - unhighlight and you know what I don't
06:25 - even need to select this one anymore so
06:28 - what I've done is I've said okay I just
06:29 - select one element and I want when you
06:32 - mouse over that one element for it to
06:33 - turn color a color and then when I mouse
06:36 - out of that element for that color to
06:37 - disappear and that worked so this is the
06:40 - code for doing that these are the two
06:41 - events now I know I can select all of
06:44 - the paragraphs with select all so in a
06:46 - loop I could assign all of them to have
06:48 - this mouse over event and all of them
06:50 - have this mouse out event is this going
06:52 - to work
06:53 - no no but clearly but the I wouldn't but
06:58 - I'm really we're gonna make it work
06:59 - that's the whole point of this video so
07:01 - here we go oh whoa
07:03 - cannot o cannot read stylepro so ah so I
07:06 - meant to leave something else in there
07:08 - so first of all nothing's working
07:09 - because like Hello in you know if you
07:13 - look at this what is this the highlight
07:16 - function always refers to that paragraph
07:17 - what is that paragraph it's the one that
07:19 - I forgot to select by unicorn let's run
07:21 - this again mmm
07:23 - right no matter what I highlight over
07:25 - it's always highlighting just that one
07:27 - will whatever I mouse over it's only
07:29 - ever highlighting that one particular
07:32 - paragraph mouse over this one that
07:34 - paragraph is highlighted mouse over this
07:36 - one that paragraph is highlighted why
07:38 - because in here the highlight function
07:42 - only ever refers to the paragraph
07:43 - selected with select unicorn I want this
07:46 - mouse over for this particular paragraph
07:48 - to refer back to itself oh this is gonna
07:51 - be a very hard problem right we're gonna
07:53 - solve this here's here's the lovely
07:56 - answer to this question p5 at the p5
07:59 - library knows that this problem comes up
08:01 - again and again and again and so p5 is
08:05 - actually going to do something special
08:07 - for you
08:07 - what p5 is going to do is when you try
08:13 - to assign a function to when you assign
08:17 - a function as an event for a particular
08:19 - Dom element if you write the keyword
08:23 - this into that function it refers to the
08:29 - Dom element that the event is attached
08:31 - to this particular element so this same
08:33 - event can be attached to
08:35 - all of these elements and Matt drew like
08:38 - magic it's basically magic through magic
08:42 - the this keyword just knows which
08:44 - element is being referred to which
08:46 - element the event is actually happening
08:48 - to so again this is it's not actually
08:50 - magic it's code that's written into the
08:52 - p5 library that assigns the this keyword
08:55 - dynamically to the correct element and
08:57 - later in another video I will show you
09:00 - how you might implement that yourself if
09:02 - like something like p5 isn't doing it
09:04 - for you so let's come back to this and
09:06 - look at this what I'm saying is I can
09:10 - put the keyword this year so the
09:16 - highlight event is assigned to every
09:19 - single paragraph it this is a function
09:23 - that's called when you mouse over one
09:25 - paragraph or the other paragraph or the
09:26 - other paragraph or the other paragraph
09:28 - when the code is executed it's executed
09:31 - because the event was triggered on a
09:32 - particular Dom element and this keyword
09:35 - will just refer to that particular Dom
09:37 - element so let's look at this again and
09:40 - you can see now whichever one I hover
09:43 - over is the one that is highlighted so
09:47 - this is kind of a magic way of assigning
09:50 - a whole bunch of Dom elements the same
09:54 - event something that gets applied to
09:56 - itself by selecting all those elements
10:01 - with select all function by iterating
10:04 - over those elements with a for loop by
10:06 - assigning a particular function to an
10:08 - event like mouse over Mouse out
10:10 - mousepressed changed input all those
10:13 - other events we saw before and by using
10:14 - the this keyword so that the same
10:17 - function becomes reusable for multiple
10:19 - Dom elements I should note by the way
10:22 - that this would also work here like if I
10:26 - were to do something like what sort of
10:28 - nice about this is if I were to do
10:30 - something like var I equals you know
10:33 - zero I is less than a hundred I plus
10:38 - plus I'm gonna make I'm gonna make a
10:43 - whole lot of elements rainbow
10:48 - and I'm gonna give them like a random
10:50 - position on that menu is absolutely I'm
10:51 - just doing something weird here I'm
10:53 - gonna give them like an absolute
10:55 - position on the page like 500 random 500
11:03 - look at this so what I'm showing you is
11:05 - not just for the elements that you make
11:08 - in HTML but oops I have an extra
11:11 - parenthesis here I guess so you can see
11:14 - look at this page now this page now I
11:16 - made all of these Dom elements called
11:18 - rainbow and they all have that event
11:20 - also so this is I'm not making like this
11:22 - like crazy nonsensical thing with like
11:24 - all these paragraphs some of which made
11:26 - in the HTML some which remain to
11:27 - JavaScript some which some of which are
11:30 - absolute position some one which are not
11:32 - absolute position the point is you can
11:34 - do all sorts of stuff now you know this
11:36 - is the power of programming sure if you
11:38 - just want to have like three paragraphs
11:40 - because it's these paragraphs from an
11:41 - essay you wrote you might just put that
11:43 - directly in the HTML page but if you
11:45 - want to fill the window with all sorts
11:47 - of randomly generated Dom elements and
11:49 - you want to assign an event to all of
11:51 - them you can do it this way so I've gone
11:52 - on for much too long about this but what
11:55 - I would say what I might give you as an
11:56 - exercise now is do exactly this and
11:59 - maybe do something that I didn't do
12:01 - which is that make a bunch of Dom
12:03 - elements assign them a given class
12:06 - select all of those and give them all
12:09 - the same event which apply some style to
12:11 - itself and see how this this keyword
12:14 - inside of your event callbacks will
12:16 - handle this for you okay good stuff I'm
12:18 - in the next video I want to look at the
12:20 - parent and child functions which allow
12:22 - you to while you're making a Dom element
12:24 - insert it into a particular part of a
12:26 - page which is very very useful and there
12:31 - we go
12:33 - sometimes this mouse doesn't work which
12:36 - is the thing I need to press to stop the
12:37 - video and I leak awkwardly still
12:38 - standing here
