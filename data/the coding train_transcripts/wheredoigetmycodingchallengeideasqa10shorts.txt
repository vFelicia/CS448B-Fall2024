00:00 - hello I'm trying a new format where I
00:02 - answer your questions you know the ones
00:04 - that you're writing right here the first
00:05 - question I'm going to answer is from
00:08 - weissman1310 I'm interested in taking a
00:10 - concept Theory or algorithm to practice
00:12 - coding however I don't really know how
00:14 - to exactly search for them you just go
00:16 - to Wikipedia and type computer science
00:18 - theory or something like that or is
00:21 - there a better place to look for them
00:22 - online this is such a good question
00:24 - there isn't a magic formula and to be
00:26 - honest most of the ideas that I've been
00:28 - doing recently have come from viewers
00:30 - who have mentioned ideas on Discord or
00:32 - social media or in YouTube comments and
00:34 - I have a GitHub repo called suggestion
00:37 - box where you can file an issue with an
00:38 - idea and I try to pull them from there a
00:40 - lot of the coding challenges actually
00:42 - come from a book called The
00:43 - computational Beauty of nature which I
00:45 - used as an incredible source for my book
00:48 - the nature of code which also is a
00:50 - source for my coding challenges if I
00:52 - could be my own source for coding
00:53 - challenges in the next part I'm going to
00:55 - show you my favorite pocket Handbook of
00:57 - algorithms minute it's not a lot of time
