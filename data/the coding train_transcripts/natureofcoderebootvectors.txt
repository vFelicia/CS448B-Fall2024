05:49 - morning this is a quick sound check
05:51 - how's my audio let me know we'll be
05:54 - starting in just a minute or two
06:06 - [Music]
06:50 - [Music]
07:24 - [Music]
07:42 - hello good morning and welcome to the
07:47 - coding trade with me your host Dan
07:49 - that's my name
07:51 - and we as we do usually on the coding
07:54 - train we begin with the numbers I
08:01 - actually only noticed that about a
08:03 - minute and a half ago I was using it as
08:05 - a prop in one of the courses that I
08:07 - teach physically in person here at New
08:09 - York University where I am live
08:10 - broadcasting to you from so I forgot to
08:14 - bring it into this room where I recorded
08:16 - so I don't have random numbers 3 maybe
08:18 - you could help me and actually this has
08:20 - to do with a little idea that I have
08:21 - that I might pursue in the future which
08:25 - is that maybe let's just as a quick
08:26 - experiment you're about 30 seconds
08:28 - behind me in real time because there's a
08:30 - bit of a lag in the live stream but if
08:33 - you could start putting random numbers
08:36 - into the chat this is how I will read
08:38 - random numbers you will experiment with
08:40 - can we create a pseudo-random number
08:44 - generator just from the viewers of the
08:47 - coding drain and while you are waiting
08:49 - those 30 seconds I will quickly while
08:51 - I'm waiting this 30 seconds let me
08:53 - quickly thank Oh wrong button but you
08:55 - can see that let me quickly thank
08:57 - dashlane the sponsor of today's coding
09:00 - train dash line which is a password
09:03 - manager that you will probably see me
09:06 - use as I log in and out of various
09:08 - things during this live stream you can
09:10 - get try a 30 day free trial of dashlane
09:13 - premium if you go to - link comm slash
09:14 - coding train and if you do like the
09:17 - service and want to get it then you'll
09:18 - get 10% off as well if you choose to
09:20 - purchase - lien premium all right I'll
09:22 - talk about - Lane again a little bit
09:24 - later let me take this off and aha whoa
09:28 - whoa whoa I cannot read these 126
09:32 - 8650 for 1150 about five thousand five
09:34 - and forty six six thousand 4.99 twenty
09:41 - thirty thousand nine to thirty one oh
09:42 - this is very friend usually the point of
09:44 - the random number readings you could
09:45 - stop now that's good we're good we're
09:48 - good
09:48 - is for it to be relaxing and soothing
09:53 - I don't remember what music I was
09:56 - recently playing with the random numbers
09:58 - there was the lullaby music like you
10:01 - know who knows um alright so let's begin
10:04 - let's let's not let's skip all of this
10:07 - mumbo jumbo where I talk about 5 million
10:09 - things about different websites that you
10:11 - could find out more and buy things and
10:13 - look at things and download code and
10:14 - contribute code and all that stuff let's
10:16 - just you the viewer and me right now
10:20 - let's get into it but before that please
10:25 - please with the random members oh
10:27 - they're in the discord this is this is
10:30 - much more effective I can actually
10:31 - manage to read these this is a really
10:34 - good one we've got 65 million seven
10:36 - hundred twenty seven thousand three
10:38 - hundred eighty two a little bit afraid
10:40 - that there are some encoded secret
10:44 - messages all right before I get into
10:51 - today's topic which will be the topic
10:53 - for the next several months probably if
10:56 - I'm being perfectly honest let me
10:57 - briefly mention to you that I will be
11:03 - appearing again on Monday if you cannot
11:06 - possibly get enough of me on the
11:08 - youtubes you can get some more of me on
11:10 - the Twitch's with mpj and fun fun
11:15 - function which is a wonderful streaming
11:18 - show thingamabob on the internet with
11:20 - mpj and who i've met in person exactly i
11:23 - think i don't know a couple times and
11:28 - and and formally talked to him on the
11:30 - internet and it's really perfect timing
11:32 - because the topic today i am going to
11:34 - launch my live streams will be filled
11:37 - with me recording short video tutorials
11:41 - to redo all the nature of code materials
11:44 - for 2020 we could get the numbers I have
11:50 - to look away and but it's good timing
11:54 - because I'm going to begin that process
11:56 - today and talk to you about vectors in
11:59 - p5.js and Creed the create vector
12:01 - function and then on Monday I'm going to
12:04 - attempt to teach essentially the same
12:05 - thing to MP
12:06 - J with through the lens of an example
12:10 - about gravitational attraction so that's
12:12 - what's happening a couple things I can
12:15 - sort of like update you on and maybe
12:17 - tease out tease a little bit well
12:21 - David's asking a really good question
12:22 - hold on hold that thought
12:25 - is that what's he gonna say I have yes
12:33 - so you as you might recall the topic
12:38 - that I was kind of going through bit by
12:40 - bit by bit over the fallen into January
12:44 - was this playlist beginner's guide to
12:47 - machine learning in JavaScript so I hope
12:48 - after today starting next week there
12:50 - will be one of these that says the
12:51 - nature of code and there will be you
12:53 - know nine or ten chapters and I'll start
12:55 - filling them all in over the next
12:57 - several weeks but is not finished in
13:01 - fact this is where I left off in the
13:03 - last session I started doing some
13:05 - tutorials about convolutional neural
13:06 - networks and there are two more in the I
13:09 - mean there you can find all that content
13:11 - in the previous live stream but the
13:12 - edited versions of them are waiting to
13:14 - be finished and will they're two that
13:16 - will appear here in the next week
13:18 - probably but I'm just gonna leave that
13:20 - to the side because I really need to do
13:25 - this nature of like a variety of reasons
13:27 - that I'm happy to answer questions about
13:31 - but that's that's what's happening and I
13:34 - will return to this david also asks will
13:37 - you have other coding challenges while
13:39 - you are doing the nature of code series
13:40 - and Cabana videos so I'd well I have
13:46 - something that I am excited to tease for
13:49 - you let's see if I can manage to just do
13:55 - a little something just to hold this
13:57 - hold your hope well hold the train stop
14:02 - the train
14:05 - why why am I not logged in if only I had
14:10 - something like a password manager like
14:13 - dashlane on my device here where I could
14:19 - look up and you might be wondering why
14:21 - am I not using the - laying on this
14:22 - laptop it's because I have a sort of
14:25 - dummy - lay an account because I don't
14:27 - want it to show all my personal stuff so
14:30 - I am looking it up now on my phone
14:34 - Google coding training oh boy this is
14:38 - taking way too long for this little
14:40 - thing
14:41 - [Music]
15:02 - don't worry I'm getting somewhere
15:04 - wrong wrong wrong this is gonna be good
15:27 - just this is gonna be good okay ready
15:45 - I'm going to bring my computer back in
15:53 - just a moment so the next coating in the
16:06 - Cabana video on the hilbert curve will
16:09 - premiere hopefully tomorrow Saturday so
16:13 - I feel like the coding of Cabana is a
16:15 - kind of video to release over a weekend
16:17 - it's like you're just there and it's
16:19 - snowing outside and all of that stuff
16:22 - and so there's this so this is the Jason
16:26 - headland who does a lot of all of the
16:27 - illustrations for the coding train
16:30 - created this lovely scene and also if I
16:33 - open up the browser I think I had it
16:35 - open too this is the springtime scene so
16:38 - this is the more standard coding in the
16:40 - Cabana scene but now this is the winter
16:43 - time theme so so that's coming tomorrow
16:47 - so bad I'm gonna leave this up here just
16:49 - cuz it's sort of like nice to have but
16:51 - let me get back to David's question so
16:56 - my focus my primary focus will be nature
16:59 - of code
17:00 - and to be honest if I was really if I
17:05 - was my I really want to update the book
17:08 - text so what I probably should do which
17:10 - I'm not gonna do is just say like hey no
17:12 - YouTube videos for the next three months
17:14 - sorry I have to work on the book text so
17:17 - I'm gonna try to do them simultaneously
17:17 - that's what my real primary focus is
17:20 - updating the book and I actually looking
17:22 - for contributions for that and
17:24 - potentially to hire a few people two
17:26 - additional people to help me with that
17:28 - which maybe I have to do some more
17:31 - thinking about that but I will I will
17:32 - post you could pro you could join the
17:34 - discord leave like a button to like
17:36 - bring up the discord but someone please
17:38 - post the discord invite link to the chat
17:40 - if you can but the discord is where I
17:43 - will is where we're kind of like
17:45 - organizing and talking about things
17:46 - coding challenges we'll see I mean those
17:50 - are the the lifeblood of the channel in
17:53 - a way those are by far and away all the
17:56 - most watched videos they're what
17:58 - bringing people in there what people
17:59 - seem to enjoy the most so I shouldn't I
18:01 - don't want to stop doing them but I just
18:03 - have this mission to just get this
18:05 - through all this nature of code stuff
18:06 - and get out there again in a way that's
18:09 - more digestible and accessible so that's
18:15 - what my focus will be but you know I
18:17 - kind of hope that I can figure out a way
18:19 - to like livestream a couple times a week
18:21 - easier said than done because there's
18:23 - also a lot of weeks where I'm traveling
18:25 - and I'll actually be taking those weeks
18:26 - off so we'll see Juan Flores in the chat
18:32 - asks I haven't seen most of the nature
18:35 - of code playlist should I wait for the
18:37 - new videos to come out up to you there's
18:42 - nothing wrong with the old nature of
18:44 - code playlist the main the main issues
18:47 - with them is that the the video quality
18:49 - is quite poor as I made them many years
18:52 - ago some of them actually in 2012 I look
18:54 - much younger but the video quality is
18:59 - not so great and so so that means that I
19:04 - would like to improve and then they're
19:07 - using processing which I still use and
19:09 - plan to keep all of the examples in and
19:11 - use in projects and have
19:13 - part of the nature of code materials but
19:15 - since a lot of my teaching now is in on
19:17 - the web in JavaScript I want to create
19:19 - videos that use JavaScript okay all
19:28 - right I think I'm gonna be have to be
19:31 - the one to link the discord link so let
19:33 - me do that real quick I don't want to
19:38 - plug the coding trade memberships even
19:40 - though that's what I'm doing right now
19:41 - but I do have this new bit but somebody
19:43 - joy and said I don't be am so he really
19:45 - loves so anybody joints could do my do
19:47 - bit I think you know what it is well
19:49 - agent last night
19:50 - useful links discord invite a copy link
19:55 - paste and enter okay oh and now let me
20:05 - just mention I know I said I wasn't
20:07 - gonna be like plugging all this stuff
20:09 - but let me just briefly mention the new
20:11 - coding terrain store I'm really uh in
20:15 - the a one thing you'll like about the
20:16 - new coding in the Cabana video is I
20:18 - don't use that chalkboard so the new
20:20 - coding the Cabana video will not have
20:21 - two chalkboard instead I actually am
20:23 - drawing in one of these coding training
20:24 - notebooks and I have this one of these
20:26 - like overhead cameras that you can see
20:28 - just like over over the notebook so
20:30 - there's actually a really interesting
20:32 - fun fact about the drawing in the
20:34 - notebook that I will see if anybody
20:36 - notices and then I'll come back well I
20:41 - will talk about it next week on the live
20:42 - stream so but I really think that I'm
20:45 - plugging is the hoodies because I
20:47 - ordered a bunch of gifts for people and
20:49 - I ordered one for myself and because
20:52 - they're they have to be made in batches
20:54 - they'll only get made if enough people
20:56 - buy sound is on the low side if it's
21:05 - manageable
21:06 - then I would prefer to keep it as is
21:09 - because I'm noticing it get all the way
21:14 - into the yellow right up to the red in
21:16 - open broadcast studio and I prefer uh to
21:19 - be able to turn it up on their own
21:22 - and use headphones okay okay okay okay
21:29 - okay oh okay all right
21:33 - I mentioned Monday stay tuned
21:37 - well now
21:52 - what oh it's just I don't have the
21:54 - nature of code like I won't bought that
21:56 - domain but it's here okay all right all
22:06 - right so here's how this worked here's
22:08 - how this is gonna work
22:12 - um so I don't know if you've all seen
22:14 - this but YouTube has a new feature
22:15 - called YouTube learning playlist so I'm
22:18 - gonna be filling that out with content
22:20 - and I have actually you know by accident
22:22 - in a way made a lot of the videos
22:25 - already so what I need to do today is
22:28 - just do like a quick intro then and then
22:34 - I think just sort of like talk about the
22:36 - introduction and is there like let me
22:39 - try to get the table of contents hold on
22:46 - a sec I'm just going to do this for a
22:49 - second hold on
22:56 - oh whoops I'm not logged into the nature
23:14 - of code they log into my - light here we
23:26 - go oh-ho - factor excellent oh no no no
23:40 - - factor authenticator
23:50 - [Music]
23:57 - [Music]
24:06 - [Music]
24:19 - [Music]
24:26 - I wanted to pull up the table of
24:51 - contents everybody always wants this
24:59 - background music I don't know that it
25:01 - exists anywhere on the Internet the song
25:03 - is called Tori the dog that's what the
25:06 - song is called and it's by a composer
25:08 - named Adam Blau ad am b Lau I think
25:13 - Adams on Twitter at Adam Blau if he
25:15 - wants to release this in somewhat
25:17 - sublicense more widely welcome to but he
25:19 - was something he happened to have his
25:21 - archive library of stuff that never got
25:23 - used and I I love that and I started
25:26 - using it now everybody asks Metro writes
25:33 - nothing happened for the last 50 minutes
25:36 - welcome to the coding train where
25:39 - nothing happens for a way longer than 15
25:42 - minutes you have won by watching the
25:45 - coding train ah lucky la Lama with the
25:49 - super chat has won 15 to 20 more minutes
25:54 - of person on the internet with a messy
25:57 - beard dancing and doing nothing
26:00 - [Music]
26:08 - shoot I lost track of what I was doing I
26:11 - yes
26:18 - okay here we go so I have with me what
26:30 - time is it
26:31 - ten o'clock just so everybody knows so
26:34 - in about a half an hour 45 minutes I
26:37 - will take a short break
26:38 - there's look like to take a break in the
26:41 - middle of my long session and then at
26:45 - noon I will be you believe it so I have
26:48 - a lot to stuff this afternoon planned so
26:50 - I've got to get out of here at noon
26:54 - Arnab asks is CNN on a hold by CNN we're
26:59 - talking about convolutional neural
27:00 - networks somewhat yes yes they answer
27:03 - this yes I talked a bit more about that
27:05 - earlier so you can scroll back in time
27:07 - if you want to find me talking about
27:09 - that okay so I think I have this I have
27:17 - the table of contents here which I'm
27:19 - gonna need and I have this all right and
27:29 - Oh hold on
27:41 - so how do I find I don't think I have it
27:46 - here we go and I have this okay so some
27:52 - of this stuff will just like make its
27:54 - way back into the playlist cuz I I have
27:56 - done updated physics library videos and
27:59 - updated genetic algorithms live videos
28:00 - and that sort of thing oh I'm not in the
28:03 - shoot I am NOT in this chat anymore okay
28:17 - I was not in the discord live supporter
28:21 - chat but now I am oh okay everybody
28:29 - let's just take a minute to relax
28:40 - Oh match you're probably not watching
28:44 - but I got to get the coating in the
28:46 - Cabana music that we use to have here
28:49 - this is what I always imagined it is
28:51 - it's not
29:02 - well I I wonder if it's that I have a
29:04 - larger viewership this morning than
29:06 - usual and I wonder if it's the topic or
29:10 - the time that's interesting to note okay
29:13 - all right I got everything I want to
29:18 - talk about so this first thing so okay
29:23 - so if you haven't watched me before it's
29:25 - a little bit of a strange thing that I
29:27 - do which is that these live sessions in
29:30 - many cases are what I what are recording
29:34 - sessions for things that will get edited
29:36 - and chunked into playlists and various
29:39 - other formats on the coding train so I
29:42 - do have a lot of redundant content and
29:44 - in some sense you might say to yourself
29:45 - I don't want to watch this person goof
29:48 - off and waste a lot of time and try
29:50 - things multiple times you could just
29:52 - wait for the edited content that would
29:54 - be my suggestion but this this is gonna
29:57 - be a bit maybe a bit more of even of an
29:59 - extreme version of that in the sense
30:01 - that I'm gonna try it like for example
30:02 - this first thing that I want to do is
30:04 - just record a video that's really no
30:06 - more than one minute long and I don't
30:08 - have a script or anything so I might try
30:10 - it a couple times which will be just
30:12 - sort of like a quick introduction to how
30:14 - I'm rebooting the nature of code
30:17 - playlist then I'm gonna look at the
30:20 - table of contents and figure out do I
30:22 - want to just go straight to making
30:23 - tutorials actually for chapter one but I
30:25 - just want to like take a quick peek at
30:27 - the table of contents to see if there's
30:29 - some stuff that I actually already have
30:30 - from the introduction that I can also do
30:35 - something with
30:39 - all right good morning all here we go
30:46 - let me go I want to get one more thing
30:50 - up cadenzas a code okay I will also call
30:56 - this up because I should acknowledge
30:58 - this but to some extent what I am doing
31:01 - is partially also available here you
31:05 - can't have too much nature of code in
31:07 - your life shouldn't be called the code
31:09 - of nature I think there's something
31:11 - already called that oh look at my Google
31:19 - power and actually even almost comes up
31:23 - I mean it comes up first this is an ad
31:25 - right or no this is some kind of like
31:27 - what it thinks we want to feature it
31:29 - snippet okay published Daniel I think
31:38 - it's spelled incorrectly I'm pretty sure
31:39 - it's sh ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii
31:47 - f and ay ay ay ay HH HH HH HH HH guess
31:56 - and proper spelling of my name just
31:58 - write write that down to get the number
32:01 - of e's right it's very important
32:09 - I can do this I think this is a nice I
32:16 - think I like the idea of like starting
32:19 - this with but you don't match yeah you
32:21 - we can replace the background so I'm
32:22 - actually not even gonna worry about that
32:24 - okay happy 2020 it is I me the person
32:41 - [Music]
32:57 - hello and happy 2020 it is me Dan from
33:01 - coding train here to launch a new
33:04 - learning playlist on YouTube called the
33:08 - nature of code that's what it says right
33:10 - here so this is not new content at all
33:12 - in fact this playlist that I'm about to
33:15 - embark upon is based on material that I
33:18 - started working on probably in 2008 and
33:21 - then published a book about which you
33:22 - can find online at nature of code calm
33:25 - in 2012 the book here that you're seeing
33:27 - is all is was written then and has
33:29 - largely not been updated uses processing
33:32 - which is a Java based creative coding
33:34 - environment and I am going to redo REI
33:37 - Mari in the process of rewriting the
33:39 - book to update things for 2020 as well
33:42 - as port a lot of detects all of the text
33:44 - and examples to JavaScript with p5.js so
33:50 - that's part of what I want to say
33:59 - so it's my dream that by the time you're
34:01 - watching this this will look totally
34:03 - different but this is where it is right
34:05 - now as I'm recording this in terms of
34:07 - what's already on the YouTube channel
34:09 - these are all of the videos most of
34:12 - these were actually recorded between 5 &
34:14 - 8 years ago the quality is is a little
34:16 - bit lower not good oh it's the best ever
34:19 - now but it's it's improved and so you
34:22 - can go back and watch these but largely
34:24 - what I'm going to do is go through a lot
34:25 - of these topics and redo these videos
34:27 - with new ways of thinking and new ideas
34:29 - and also JavaScript I should mention
34:33 - that some of the stuff I did update more
34:35 - recently like genetic algorithms and
34:36 - neural networks and physics libraries
34:38 - and little bits and pieces in here so
34:40 - there will be if you're following
34:41 - through this playlist there will be
34:42 - something like forward and backward in
34:44 - time of how things that when things have
34:45 - been recorded but hopefully it will all
34:47 - piece together with a nice narrative
35:00 - if you want to follow if you want to
35:04 - follow the work in progress as it's
35:06 - happening on if you want to follow the
35:12 - work if you want to follow the book
35:16 - being updated and the examples being
35:18 - updated as it's happening I'll refer you
35:20 - to the nature of code on github so here
35:23 - are all of the open source repositories
35:25 - for all of the raw material of the book
35:27 - so the book itself is an NOC book -
35:29 - there's a whole section there about the
35:31 - build process of the book which I'm
35:33 - really looking for help with if you're
35:34 - watching this please jump on in and help
35:36 - me out um there's the syllabus which is
35:39 - for course that I'm teaching at ITP New
35:42 - York University to school the arts
35:43 - there's the code for the website
35:45 - there's the processing examples there's
35:47 - the p5 just examples and there's even
35:48 - some Python examples as well and so all
35:51 - of this is stuff that I'm going to be
35:52 - working on and my goal is that sometime
35:55 - by the end of 2020 all of this will be
35:57 - complete this video series that is there
35:59 - in front of you will have be all filled
36:01 - out and we can all just have a little
36:04 - dance and be merry go merrily on our way
36:06 - let me also give a mention of cadenza
36:09 - which produced which I participated in
36:12 - producing an online course called the
36:14 - nature of code years ago a bunch of
36:16 - years ago as well that has a lot of
36:18 - video tutorials a lot of similar content
36:20 - this is also a nice resource a
36:21 - compliment to what I'm doing here as
36:23 - well so I probably should have mentioned
36:27 - what this is about hmm
36:34 - that's fine
36:41 - I'm trying to think look I didn't really
36:44 - bleed off of what this is about but
36:46 - that's fine
36:48 - well could I could redo this or we could
36:50 - edit it in a different order or or I
36:56 - could just do it right now
37:18 - introduction
37:29 - I probably should have mentioned what
37:32 - this is all about so this book is about
37:35 - looking at the world around us the
37:38 - natural world being inspired by it and
37:41 - trying to create software experiences
37:43 - interactive experiences inspired and
37:45 - based on those things so the table of
37:47 - contents has physics simulation so the
38:00 - first bit of advice that I might give
38:02 - you here in the words of George
38:03 - Washington Carver is go take a walk
38:06 - outside experience the world around you
38:08 - draw on that for how for when you build
38:11 - software and write code and they you
38:12 - know think about your humanity in our
38:17 - I'm trying to be profound not really
38:20 - working so the first bit of advice that
38:28 - I might give you like drawing on my cell
38:30 - face what's funny is like all my old
38:34 - videos just had all this stuff in them
38:36 - and I guess it's here on the live stream
38:37 - we really did enjoy that and edit all
38:39 - this stuff out but what can you do the
38:52 - first bit of advice I might have for you
38:54 - is I'm gonna get through this sentence
38:57 - the first bit of advice I might have for
38:59 - you and you know thinking of the words
39:00 - of George Washington Carver go take a
39:02 - walk outside experience the world around
39:04 - you be with people be with human beings
39:07 - enjoy nature and that might help really
39:10 - give you ideas an inspiration for what
39:12 - you might want to create when you sit
39:13 - down to code and that's really what this
39:15 - book is about for me you know fractal
39:17 - cellar automata autonomous agents of
39:19 - physics simulation genetic algorithms
39:21 - neural networks this happens to be a
39:23 - list of things that I'm going to go
39:26 - through step by step by step throughout
39:28 - this series but really there's so much
39:30 - more to the world that we live in than
39:32 - just that into outer space and beyond
39:35 - it's universe so I hope that as you
39:37 - watch this series you think beyond just
39:39 - what I have here create stuff and also
39:41 - share it with
39:42 - so stay tuned look in this video's
39:44 - description there's lots of ways if
39:45 - you're watching these videos that you
39:46 - can share projects you've made mostly on
39:49 - the coding train comm where I think
39:51 - that's where I'm gonna put stuff but
39:53 - there's just check the video description
39:54 - all that will be ironed out
39:56 - I gotta end this because this is really
39:57 - just a rambling introduction I want to
39:59 - get into the content I'm gonna come back
40:00 - and redo this anyway once all the videos
40:02 - are so hopefully this is like now you're
40:06 - watching this sometime in the future is
40:07 - like an interesting like historical
40:08 - footnote but thanks I've come with me on
40:12 - this journey nature of code and I can't
40:14 - I hope you enjoy it I'm gonna enjoy
40:16 - making it I know because I do enjoy this
40:18 - kind of stuff and I can't wait to see
40:21 - what you do
40:21 - good bye alright okay um so that's gonna
40:35 - be what I got for that okay so next
40:51 - so I think what I'm going to do since I
40:55 - have a lot of videos already is let me
41:00 - do a quick a quick hopefully not even 30
41:05 - seconds a quick 30 seconds just about
41:15 - the introduction and then the playlist
41:22 - is just going to have in it Perlin noise
41:23 - video and random walk videos and then
41:27 - I'll move on to vectors okay
41:32 - did you stick with me so now you're in
41:35 - the first section of the nature of code
41:37 - learning playlist and that section is
41:40 - the introduction so what's actually
41:41 - going to happen now if you keep watching
41:43 - is the next videos that pop up into your
41:45 - feed our videos that I made in the last
41:47 - several years about Perlin noise the
41:50 - history of perla noise and something
41:52 - called open simplex noise as well as
41:54 - random walks so this is really just
41:56 - meant to be a warm-up a way to get your
41:58 - like sort of like dip your toe into the
41:59 - water maybe I haven't programmed in
42:01 - p5.js with JavaScript or object-oriented
42:04 - programming in a while and so this will
42:06 - get you give you a bit of a sense of a
42:07 - little bit of a warm-up before I move on
42:09 - to the next chapter vectors so that's
42:13 - where I will be where inventors I'll be
42:14 - wearing these clothes because at this
42:16 - moment right now I have recordings going
42:18 - to next go talk about vectors but before
42:20 - I before you see me then oh this is so
42:23 - the space cut nature of code is really
42:26 - disrupting the space-time continuum
42:28 - before you see those you'll see a bunch
42:30 - of videos about perla noise and random
42:34 - walks which you can draw upon I think as
42:36 - a starting point for how you might want
42:38 - to start working with vectors
42:47 - this is working right oh boy hmm I don't
42:54 - know I'll come free do all this next
42:55 - week now okay I want to go back and look
43:15 - in my channel to see what all the videos
43:17 - I already have they can go in that
43:18 - playlist but I guess I'll do that on my
43:20 - own time not with you right here and so
43:23 - I can actually get into some real stuff
43:25 - here so the very first video
43:39 - and as my whiteboard operational is this
43:47 - camera crooked how crooked is it you're
43:50 - a crooked camera I have a have a level
44:01 - yeah it's pretty off so I needs to you
44:05 - think I would check these things before
44:06 - I start recording that's a little better
44:09 - I think I made it I don't know if I made
44:13 - it better or worse worse worse but worse
44:20 - the other way yeah oh this is good this
44:26 - is good
44:26 - that looks level okay
44:37 - okay
44:40 - where are we timewise 10:15 the nice
44:43 - thing about this stuff is I think
44:45 - something will I mean I shouldn't say
44:46 - this now because famous last words but
44:50 - unlike with a lot of machine learning
44:51 - stuff and some of the coding challenges
44:53 - where I can get you stuck for hours I
44:55 - know this material fairly well so I
44:58 - think I'm actually gonna be able to move
44:59 - through it fairly quickly but we'll see
45:02 - we'll see if that really holds true
45:11 - okay being told to brush my teeth brush
45:15 - my eye bruh shhhhht my teeth I brush my
45:18 - teeth mmm just maybe I had a little
45:23 - spinach in my breakfast which is healthy
45:26 - and maybe that a little piece but you
45:29 - really should be telling me to do is
45:30 - trim my beard and go get a haircut
45:31 - that's what my mother would say uh-huh
45:35 - all right what am i doing all right
45:43 - oh thank you this is actually David
45:48 - wrote I liked how these intros came out
45:50 - really pleases me because I feel very
45:53 - confused how to do this all right let me
46:03 - I want to open up an example
46:17 - actually I want to get the random Walker
46:19 - example okay let's go I have an idea I'm
46:25 - going to go to the random walk web
46:39 - editor so this is the code from and let
46:45 - me I'm gonna this is the code from the
46:46 - random walk challenge and if you will
46:49 - oblige I'm gonna just make this object
46:53 - oriented person object oriented you know
46:56 - what maybe I'm not gonna make it object
47:01 - oriented maybe I will leave it as such
47:05 - okay that's fine because this is where
47:07 - it left off
47:21 - ah I saved over it hold on I think it
47:27 - should be okay now duplicate
47:37 - know how to name these
47:49 - okay
47:54 - I'll leave this up anymore
48:00 - actually just out of curiosity how did I
48:03 - do this before vectors P vector class
48:05 - vector math vector math to acceleration
48:07 - yeah all right
48:08 - I mean that's probably what I'm going to
48:10 - do again okay
48:23 - welcome to nature of code chapter 1
48:26 - vectors so the poor purpose the
48:29 - pointless
48:37 - welcome to nature of code chapter 1
48:40 - vectors so the purpose of this first
48:43 - video is just to explain what a vector
48:46 - is what is a vector as well as look at
48:52 - what it means to use the concept of a
48:55 - vector with p5.js hold on a sec
49:14 - now if you watched now if you watch some
49:18 - of the videos in the introduction
49:19 - section one of the examples I went
49:22 - through is a random walk this is a
49:25 - single point x and y in this example I
49:30 - have two variables x and y together they
49:34 - make up a position in the canvas and
49:36 - then every cycle through draw every
49:39 - frame of animation I pick a random
49:40 - number 0 1 2 & 3 and move it either to
49:43 - the right the left up or down this is
49:46 - using vectors so the concept of a vector
49:55 - is something you're probably using all
49:57 - the time in your programming without
49:59 - realizing it but maybe you're not
50:01 - actually getting full power out of
50:04 - vectors because you're not yet using p5
50:06 - dot vector so that's really where I'm
50:11 - leading here but let's zoom back out and
50:14 - talk about what a vector is so first let
50:17 - me use another term for you
50:20 - scalar so scalar might sound like some
50:25 - scary math terminology that you seems
50:27 - unfamiliar to you but this is actually
50:29 - saying you have definitely been using
50:30 - all along
50:31 - for example here is an example of a
50:34 - scalar value 6 oh I've got another one
50:38 - for you 14 zero point three one nine two
50:43 - two two two that's my favorite scalar so
50:46 - a scalar is a numeric value a single
50:50 - value it is a magnitude so the concept
50:53 - here is something is a is something that
50:55 - has a magnitude
51:01 - for example the my height is a scalar
51:05 - value my weight is a scalar value you
51:09 - know I want to use height and weight as
51:10 - an example so for example the really
51:26 - stuck here
51:28 - so for example the length of this marker
51:32 - is a scalar value the weight of this
51:35 - marker is a scalar value anything that
51:38 - you can measure in a magnitude in a
51:39 - single number is a scalar
51:46 - a vector is something that has is a
51:52 - vector is an entity that has not just
51:56 - magnitude but also direction this is the
52:05 - idea of a vector now I should preface
52:08 - all of this by saying that vectors are
52:10 - things oh this I should prep I should
52:14 - preface this by saying that the concept
52:16 - of a vector extends into many many many
52:19 - dimensionality yeah oh I shouldn't say
52:24 - wait oh I should have said wait I have
52:27 - to go all the way back I have to go all
52:30 - the way back I should have said wait
52:31 - thank you thank you thank you I'm so
52:33 - glad I'm doing this live that was like
52:35 - the worst thing I could have possibly
52:37 - done thank you thank you thank you chat
52:39 - Thank You chat Thank You chat I owe you
52:44 - my life I owe you the fact that I will
52:48 - not eventually have to see ten thousand
52:50 - comments and remake all these videos
52:52 - forever and ever and ever
52:54 - don't say wait don't say wait don't say
52:55 - wait don't say wait don't say wait don't
52:58 - say wait don't say wait wait don't say
53:02 - wait
53:11 - what are some other good examples the
53:15 - length of something the volume of
53:18 - something oh the number of you know the
53:23 - like I could I could like count like the
53:25 - number of things I have in a pile what
53:29 - are some other good examples
53:47 - the chat is too far behind me size area
53:50 - volume okay
53:51 - yeah area is good distance oh thank you
53:54 - distance distance it's such a good thing
53:55 - all right I thank you Oh time that's
53:59 - good okay
54:11 - examples of a scalar value are things
54:14 - that you can I lost my home momentum
54:17 - here but that's my temperature that's
54:19 - good thank you thank you chat
54:32 - examples of things that are scaler are
54:34 - things that you can measure like the the
54:37 - length of this marker the distance
54:39 - between me and you wherever you are all
54:41 - are in the world is a that's a scaler
54:45 - but like I you could also make it a
54:46 - vector it's not distance isn't about
54:49 - your distance is a scaler I've got to
54:51 - get back I've gotta get going back into
54:53 - this examples of scalar quantities are
54:58 - things like the length of this marker
55:00 - the volume of the area area is good Oh
55:07 - use my coding train oh examples
55:12 - examples of things that are scalar
55:13 - quantities are like oh the length of
55:15 - this marker maybe the surface area of
55:18 - this beautiful coding training notebook
55:21 - [Music]
55:22 - temperature how many what is it what how
55:25 - hot it is how hot is it outside whether
55:27 - it's Fahrenheit or Celsius or Kelvin
55:28 - that's a scalar quantity the distance
55:31 - between two points how far away in the
55:33 - world are you from me right now
55:35 - that's a scalar quantity anything that
55:37 - you can measure as a single magnitude
55:39 - that is a scalar a vector is something
55:43 - that is both magnitude not both not both
55:49 - a distances yeah displacement distances
55:57 - of distances a scalar
55:59 - now we can think of how I will get I'll
56:03 - kind of clarify that a vector however
56:09 - has not just magnitude
56:17 - nann dude but also directions this is
56:24 - the idea of a vector it's a quantity an
56:29 - entity that has both a magnitude and a
56:32 - direction one thing that's important for
56:35 - me to say is vectors can exist in many
56:38 - kinds of dimensional spaces two
56:40 - dimensional space three dimensional
56:42 - space four dimensional dimensional we
56:46 - can keep going but this it and and you
56:50 - might have heard me say the term vector
56:51 - in other videos that I made maybe about
56:53 - machine learning and data but what I'm
56:56 - going to do in this series is constrain
57:00 - myself restrict myself to talking about
57:03 - vectors in a two dimensional space this
57:08 - is because I am working with them in a
57:11 - p5.js canvas and that happens to be a
57:14 - two dimensional space you might want to
57:17 - use the concept of vector in three
57:19 - dimensions because you might choose and
57:23 - I might do some examples that look at
57:24 - vectors in three dimensions and in fact
57:26 - p5 vectors do support three dimensions
57:29 - 3d graphics or a thing but my focus and
57:32 - trying to explain all of this and look
57:33 - at the math will be sticking in two
57:35 - dimensions yeah
57:55 - the typical way a vector is tip the
58:01 - typical way a vector is what am I trying
58:04 - to say
58:05 - visualized or 10:30 15 minutes I'm
58:08 - taking a break I'm trying to stick to my
58:09 - schedule represented that's the word I'm
58:21 - looking for
58:22 - the typical way a vector is represented
58:25 - is by an arrow so let me return back to
58:30 - this random walk example and look at
58:33 - this I had an X and a Y and then X and Y
58:35 - is moving randomly drawing its trail how
58:39 - could I think of that x and y as a
58:41 - vector I had two variables x and y they
58:50 - represent a point in space two
58:53 - dimensional space x and y I could think
58:57 - of these this x and y together as a
59:01 - vector that provides instructions for
59:03 - how to get from the origin point zero
59:06 - zero all the way to that x and y so this
59:10 - is the idea of thinking in terms of
59:13 - vectors this entity this this entity
59:18 - this entity this vector has both a
59:21 - magnitude that is its length how long is
59:26 - the vector this entity this vector has
59:42 - both a magnitude what is the magnitude
59:45 - it is the length of this arrow and a
59:49 - direction what is the direction it's the
59:51 - way the arrow is pointing and I could
59:54 - think of that in different ways but one
59:56 - way of thinking about that is as an
59:57 - angle often represented with the Greek
59:59 - letter theta so I could think of a
60:01 - vector as the length of an arrow as well
60:05 - as what direction is it's pointing as an
60:08 - angle relative to you know the origin
60:11 - point
60:20 - I know some people in that chatter
60:22 - saying a coordinate is a vector well so
60:27 - there's a couple things I want to say
60:28 - about this
60:37 - now probably this were now probably the
60:41 - canonical example of a vector is the
60:46 - concept of velocity the velocity of an
60:54 - object
61:05 - yeah
61:12 - so maybe I don't want to address that
61:13 - right now because I want to get I'm
61:17 - gonna get into this in a little bit I
61:20 - will mention this thing about is a
61:22 - coordinate really a vector I will give
61:24 - you my take on that I don't want to give
61:33 - so conceptually so conceptually I'm
61:40 - talking about this vector as this arrow
61:42 - and the arrow has both the length
61:46 - magnitude and the direction let me take
61:59 - a minute to redo this diagram in a more
62:00 - traditional math way because canvases
62:04 - are a little strange in that the origin
62:06 - is in the top-left and that Y points
62:08 - down but a more typical Cartesian plane
62:12 - a 2-dimensional plane cartesian named
62:14 - for a guy named a the mathematician
62:17 - might have an XY coordinate right here
62:20 - and i could represent and the origin
62:22 - right here and i could draw an arrow
62:24 - between these two so conceptually the
62:30 - vector has the magnitude which is this
62:33 - particular length and the direction
62:35 - which represented by this angle relative
62:38 - to the horizontal axis
62:51 - however I am conflating a little bit two
62:55 - concepts which is this idea of a
62:57 - coordinate or a position and a vector
62:59 - this idea of this vector itself the
63:02 - concept of this vector is just this
63:04 - arrow it doesn't represent any specific
63:08 - location in two-dimensional space it
63:11 - just represents instructions for how to
63:13 - get from one position to another
63:15 - position and in the case that I'm
63:18 - talking about those instructions are
63:20 - from the origin to the position X Y so
63:23 - in a moment I'm gonna start talking
63:25 - about velocity which is going to be used
63:28 - in our code to describe well if this is
63:30 - my thing at this X Y it's gonna go here
63:33 - then it's gonna go here then it's gonna
63:34 - go here then it's gonna go here I might
63:36 - have a bunch of velocity vectors giving
63:38 - it a path this idea of the vector itself
63:41 - is really a concept of the arrow not the
63:45 - specific location but a position in a p5
63:49 - sketch can be thought of as a vector
63:51 - with instructions from how to get to the
63:53 - origin to that XY location itself and in
64:01 - that sense it really is relative because
64:03 - if I use the translate function to move
64:05 - the origin around that vector is going
64:06 - to kind of move around with that so
64:12 - hopefully that addresses it
64:26 - Simon is saying is that actually a quote
64:35 - from an actual three blue one brown
64:36 - video or are you Simon just reminisce is
64:39 - is giving me is writing in the discord
64:42 - chat about different ways to describe a
64:45 - vector with physics computer science and
64:46 - machine learning and with just sort of
64:48 - like more theoretical math now
64:57 - interestingly enough even though I am
64:59 - talking about vectors as part with this
65:02 - core idea of magnitude in fluently
65:06 - oddly enough even though I am starting
65:09 - this discussion off about vectors
65:11 - focusing on these core concepts
65:13 - magnitude and direction the actual
65:16 - values stored in the p5 vector object
65:20 - which I really haven't shown you yet but
65:22 - I'm going to get to are not the
65:24 - magnitude and direction but rather the
65:26 - components of a vector what do I mean by
65:28 - components well that I actually mean
65:31 - these this.x and this.y because in fact
65:35 - look at this arrow here I can make this
65:39 - into a little bit of a triangle and
65:43 - imagine the y equals three right the Y
65:47 - value is three go up by three the x
65:49 - value is four go across by four x equals
65:55 - four y equals 3 the vector the vector is
66:01 - actually 4 comma 3
66:08 - the data stored with the vector are
66:11 - actually these numbers 4:3 and I could
66:13 - choose to write them in different ways I
66:20 - could say 4 comma 3 or I could write
66:25 - these sort of brackets and write 4 3
66:27 - like that so in many cases more
66:29 - generically a vector is actually just a
66:31 - list of numbers it's a list of
66:33 - components and if I were in two
66:38 - dimensions I would have two numbers
66:40 - three dimensions three numbers four
66:41 - dimensions four numbers etc etc and this
66:43 - again comes up more in machine learning
66:46 - and data science but in the concept of
66:51 - physics I'm really thinking about this
66:54 - two-dimensional space with just an X and
66:56 - a Y and incidentally I will ask you the
66:58 - question what is the magnitude of this
67:01 - vector think about that for a second
67:04 - maybe you've heard of a 3 4 5 triangle
67:07 - right if one side of a right triangle
67:10 - with a 90 degree angle is 3 the other
67:13 - side is 4 the hypotenuse of that
67:15 - triangle is 5 so one of the things
67:17 - you'll discover as I do more videos
67:18 - about different vector math is a lot of
67:21 - the math with vectors particularly in
67:23 - two-dimensional space that is relates to
67:25 - trigonometry and trigonometry and all
67:34 - the same math associated with right
67:36 - triangles
67:43 - Oh so three blue one brown has a video
67:46 - called vectors what even are they
67:48 - essence of linear algebra chapter one
67:50 - got it okay so we are moving along here
68:08 - I'm almost done with this video
68:10 - oh I don't have it there's nothing in
68:17 - here I take it that means it's time for
68:18 - me to take a break I lost had all these
68:22 - viewers all left once I started talking
68:24 - about vectors what's going on or do
68:26 - people just have to go to work or
68:28 - something or go to sleep
68:29 - I feel like nobody-nobody in my time
68:31 - zone watch just these videos it's either
68:33 - people are watching them because it's
68:34 - early in the morning for them or the
68:36 - late at night for them
68:39 - okay Oh Alicia ray writes I'm in linear
68:45 - algebra this semester I might go check
68:47 - that out you definitely should if you're
68:50 - looking for if you are if you are
68:54 - looking for helpful videos about
68:58 - mathematics
68:59 - I find the three blue one Brown Channel
69:01 - I mean okay I didn't weigh like I feel
69:03 - like oh my God all I ever do on the
69:05 - coding train is talk about three so and
69:08 - in fact my hilbert curve video comes out
69:10 - I'm talking about three blue one brown
69:11 - but it's really hard to find a better
69:14 - resource for understanding really calm
69:18 - sophisticated topics in mathematics in a
69:21 - delightful visual way it might not be
69:24 - the way that everybody learns but for me
69:25 - and I think a lot of people those kinds
69:28 - of explanations are just amazing okay
69:32 - thank you for assignment for clarifying
69:35 - on that all right and and David writes
69:36 - n-dimensional vector math is mostly trig
69:39 - expanded into the n dimension which is
69:40 - true Kevin from Baltimore go o's next
69:45 - years the year yes Baltimore in the
69:50 - house okay
69:53 - any video Farhan I do have a video on a
69:57 - star okay I got it got off track
70:02 - I'm gonna finish this off and then take
70:04 - a short break
70:14 - reference
70:21 - I'm just gonna hit a create vector
70:25 - whoa this is not oh it is that is so
70:29 - weird
70:31 - I think this okay so this is fine but I
70:34 - would suggest I've never noticed this
70:36 - maybe there's a good reason that I'm not
70:38 - thinking of this seems like a really
70:39 - weird example to have as the thing that
70:43 - pops up on the create vector reference
70:45 - page like it's the second argument of
70:47 - the point light function that's creating
70:49 - a victor based off of sign of Millie's
70:51 - hoof I don't know if anybody wants to
70:56 - file an issue about this or to probably
71:01 - be five website repo I guess but I kind
71:04 - of actually I'm gonna I'm not gonna I'm
71:05 - gonna move to a different page let's
71:07 - just try let's try this one
71:11 - yes so frankly I would suggest this just
71:16 - go on the create vector page Euclidian
71:21 - ah that's good okay
71:27 - my a star was buggy
71:32 - welcome to the coding train where you
71:37 - have one an example code with lots of
71:40 - bugs in it have fun when you apply it to
71:44 - your project the bugs will still be
71:46 - there and as part of your learning
71:48 - experience you can fix those bugs
71:53 - [Music]
72:04 - alright here we go
72:17 - [Applause]
72:20 - [Music]
72:35 - so first
72:40 - returning back to the random walker
72:42 - example we can look at this once again
72:44 - no not once again returning back to the
72:51 - random walker example we can look at
72:53 - this again the God again again for the
72:58 - first time now for the first time return
73:05 - returning back to the random walker
73:07 - example we can look at this with a new
73:08 - lens with a new view on outlook on life
73:11 - well like that outlook on life returning
73:16 - back to this random walker example we
73:18 - can look at with a new outlook on life
73:19 - and that is vectors instead of having
73:22 - and this is really the first thing when
73:24 - you're starting to program with p5
73:26 - vector you're already this is already
73:28 - using the concept of vectors in the way
73:30 - that I described it to you but I want to
73:32 - rewrite this now with p5 vector so
73:40 - here's the reference page for p5 vector
73:43 - I encourage you to click over and check
73:45 - it out and read through it p f-- o
73:50 - actually yeah
73:57 - so many things I want to do so many
73:59 - things I want to do in this video so I'm
74:05 - thinking about the order of this but so
74:11 - here I need to go ate some water I got
74:14 - like a frog in my throat but I don't I
74:17 - want to finish this before I take a
74:18 - break there's nothing left in this okay
74:33 - [Music]
74:41 - okay
74:46 - here is the reference page on the p5
74:48 - website for p5 dot vector now it's a
74:50 - little strange that there's this thing
74:52 - called p5 dot vector maybe I can return
74:54 - back to that in a moment a little bit
74:56 - but what I want to highlight for you is
74:58 - this right here create vector the
75:01 - function create vector is what makes an
75:03 - object in p5 that is a vector object a
75:07 - p5 dr. and when you create a vector you
75:10 - give it two values an x and a y it also
75:13 - can optionally take a third for an XYZ
75:16 - but again I'm not making use of the
75:18 - third dimension right now so the first
75:20 - thing beyond all the fun interesting new
75:24 - vector math that I will explore is just
75:26 - replacing my old XY variables with one
75:29 - variable that is a p5 vector going into
75:34 - the code I'll comment this out and I
75:37 - will say I'm gonna say pause for
75:39 - position and then here and set up I'm
75:44 - going to say position equals create
75:47 - vector and the X is with divided by 2
75:50 - the Y is height divided by 2 I want to
75:56 - draw that point at pause dot X and pause
76:01 - da and while this random walker and
76:06 - while this code this random Walker code
76:09 - is is based on the sort of core idea of
76:11 - a random walker that can only go in four
76:13 - different directions up down left and
76:16 - right
76:22 - I want to instead simplify this and just
76:27 - let X&Y change by any random
76:29 - floating-point number between negative 1
76:31 - and 1 as well
76:34 - so to do that I'll say Paz dot x equals
76:37 - positive x plus random negative 1 1 same
76:46 - for y wait sorry
76:49 - same for y and I'm gonna run the sketch
77:02 - weird where does that error come from oh
77:04 - whoops
77:09 - and I'm gonna run this sketch
77:21 - so step one of working with vectors in
77:24 - p5 is go and find something you once
77:27 - made that had separate X and y variables
77:29 - and see if you could use create vector
77:31 - instead for them yeah go ahead do that
77:35 - now I'll wait
77:42 - step two I would say is that I want to
77:46 - start building a foundation for a
77:48 - physics engine ultimately through all of
77:51 - these chapter 1 videos and chapter 2
77:53 - videos by the end of all of them I'm
77:55 - going to have a very rudimentary physics
77:58 - engine that I can build a lot more
78:00 - projects on top of it will also serve as
78:03 - a kind of foundation of knowledge and
78:06 - understanding to use more sophisticated
78:08 - and robust physics engines from other
78:10 - libraries that's kind of the point of
78:11 - where this all is going but in order to
78:13 - do that I want to make heavy use of
78:15 - object-oriented programming so if you've
78:17 - never done object-oriented programming
78:19 - before or worked with classes in
78:21 - JavaScript a class being a template for
78:23 - creating an object then I might refer
78:25 - you to go back to my beginner coding
78:27 - videos where there's a whole section on
78:29 - object-oriented programming but for
78:31 - right now just to kind of recap that I'm
78:33 - going to very quickly create a walker
78:35 - object so instead of having a position
78:39 - variable that's just in the global space
78:41 - I'm going to make a walker class and
78:43 - create a walker object that is in the
78:45 - global space
78:52 - so
78:54 - also to keep things organized and this
78:56 - is just sort of my style I'm gonna make
78:57 - a separate JavaScript file for Walker
79:07 - then I'll write it as a class with a
79:15 - constructor function that will receive
79:17 - an x and a y it will have one variable a
79:22 - position
79:35 - so this is where I'm starting the Walker
79:37 - is essentially a rapper a rapper so this
79:45 - is where I'm beginning the Walker is
79:47 - essentially an object that stores that
79:49 - one vector position and I've got to use
79:51 - that this dot syntax because the
79:53 - position is the
80:09 - the Walker class has one piece of data
80:12 - associated with it the position vector
80:15 - and I use the this dot sequence so that
80:17 - the position is an instance variable
80:19 - that's part of the Walker object itself
80:23 - what does the Walker do it walks so I
80:26 - could call that step or walk or update
80:28 - I'm gonna use the the name update I'm
80:30 - gonna write a function and I'm gonna
80:31 - grab the code that I have here bring it
80:36 - in to Walker J s and what am I missing
80:49 - [Music]
80:51 - now that I have the position vector as
80:53 - part of the Walker class I need to refer
80:55 - to the position as this dot position
80:57 - which at some point is going to create
80:59 - some messy looking not missing which at
81:01 - some point is going to create some
81:02 - awkward looking longer winded code but
81:04 - we're gonna live with that and then I
81:06 - think I'm gonna have a show function for
81:08 - drawing the Walker I will grab this code
81:13 - that draws the point this dot
81:21 - and now I have my Walker class complete
81:24 - it the constructor creates a position
81:26 - vector the update function updates the
81:28 - X&Y position and the show function draws
81:31 - the position back into sketch I'm going
81:37 - to make the variable now called Walker
81:41 - in setup call the constructor with with
81:50 - / - with with an initial position with
81:53 - an initial position of 200 200
81:57 - and then in draw update and I think I
82:06 - forgot the stroke and all of that as
82:08 - part of its show function put that back
82:13 - in and now oops what do I have wrong oh
82:16 - I forgot to reference Walker J s in
82:20 - index.html and there we go
82:26 - I have exactly the same random Walker
82:37 - so this brings me to the end of this
82:40 - first video about what is a vector and
82:42 - using p5 vector in your code in your
82:45 - JavaScript code in p5.js but I have
82:48 - really barely scratched the surface I'm
82:50 - not doing anything other than thinking
82:52 - of this p5 vector as a place to hold the
82:56 - X&Y variable I really want to start
82:58 - thinking about this concept of a vector
83:00 - more I really want to start thinking
83:04 - about this concept of a vector more
83:06 - formally and start to think well if I
83:08 - have a position to erase all this
83:18 - I really want to start thinking about
83:22 - this concept of a vector more formally
83:24 - and if I have a position represented as
83:29 - a vector pointing from the origin to the
83:32 - XY location where I'm drawing something
83:34 - then couldn't that object that has that
83:37 - position also have a velocity
83:42 - representing as an arrow that's moving
83:45 - its current position to its next
83:47 - position in my animation and maybe I
83:50 - could have also something called an
83:51 - acceleration which is a vector that
83:56 - which in the same which in the same way
84:03 - that velocity is changing the position
84:05 - over time the acceleration is changing
84:08 - the velocity over time and I've heard
84:11 - about this thing called a force
84:13 - maybe there's something like Newton's
84:15 - laws and physics and motion and things
84:18 - that are at rest and they stay at rest
84:19 - and all that stuff could I somehow take
84:21 - this concept of a force maybe you've
84:24 - heard of this equation force equals mass
84:27 - times acceleration could that play a
84:29 - role in how acceleration is calculated
84:33 - which changes velocity which changes
84:35 - position and so these are the
84:36 - foundational elements of a physics
84:38 - engine and I am going to build all of
84:42 - those slowly bit by pit while talking
84:44 - about different mathematical operations
84:47 - with vectors and that's what you'll see
84:48 - in the next few videos in the next few
84:50 - videos all throughout chapter one and
84:51 - chapter two so if you're interested just
84:54 - keep on I don't know if they're there
84:56 - right now but when they're there they'll
84:58 - be there and you can watch them I'm
85:00 - making them in these clothes or a
85:02 - different clothes depending which day
85:03 - and recording them goodbye
85:12 - alright alright everyone
85:15 - so that is who I've kicked this off oh
85:17 - I'm so happy I'm getting I'm getting
85:19 - some momentum here because I feel like
85:21 - if I can get some momentum I might go
85:23 - just like pop into the studio and just
85:26 - like oh I have an hour free let me just
85:27 - do the next one and the next one some of
85:29 - those by the way I will probably do as
85:31 - member-only livestreams just cuz but as
85:35 - a as a benefit for members all the
85:38 - edited content will of course make its
85:41 - way out to the channel but but yeah so
85:50 - I'm not done for today I have another
85:51 - hour left but I'm gonna take a short
85:54 - break and talk to you about briefly also
85:59 - thank my friends over at dashlane who
86:03 - are the sponsor of today's coding train
86:05 - Kony train would not really be possible
86:06 - all of the people who work on editing
86:08 - and everything and all the stuff that
86:10 - I'm putting out there it cost money and
86:11 - having sponsors is a really wonderful
86:13 - thing that I can't have the opportunity
86:15 - for to help me keep this project going
86:17 - and dashlane is a password manager and
86:22 - so if you'll I have something to show
86:25 - you which is this so if you have you
86:29 - know if your life feels very
86:30 - inconvenient and you can't manage all
86:32 - these passwords I mean how many things
86:34 - have I had to log into just on this
86:36 - livestream alone the web editor github I
86:38 - had to log in to a whole lot of stuff
86:39 - that I had to turn my screen off because
86:40 - I didn't want all this other private
86:42 - stuff showing up and so I I'm I having a
86:44 - password manager I can actually have
86:46 - different passwords for absolutely
86:47 - everything you can also store credit
86:50 - card information and so Biggs checking
86:52 - out and paying stuff online so much so
86:55 - much easier and so you know there are
87:02 - solutions like keychain and chrome have
87:04 - this but you get locked into a single
87:05 - system and all of your passwords are
87:07 - trapped in one place you know you have
87:09 - to watch out for other solutions like
87:11 - log in with Facebook with that that you
87:12 - know you might be at risk of your data
87:14 - being misused and sold so - Lee never
87:17 - has access to your personal data and
87:18 - won't trick you into subscribing there's
87:20 - no credit card
87:21 - to sign up - Layne cannot see your data
87:23 - and it is an ad-free product so if you
87:27 - can fill out forms fast with one-click
87:29 - logins and auto fills and here's the
87:31 - other thing that I really love about
87:32 - using a password manager is that it
87:35 - works across all devices so I'm always
87:39 - logging the stuff on my phone or a
87:40 - tablet or the laptop or then I'm on this
87:42 - treatmen computer and this computer so I
87:45 - can have basically everything stored in
87:47 - a way that I can log in and then when
87:49 - I'm you know when I'm somewhere at a
87:52 - public computer and I need my password I
87:53 - can just pull out my phone and grab it
87:55 - so that particular is really useful it
87:58 - is used by 11 million users in 180
88:02 - countries endorsed by The Wall Street
88:03 - Journal New York Times Fast Company
88:04 - Forbes Wired and more top rated on the
88:06 - iOS App Store and a recommended app by
88:09 - both Apple and Google so if you are
88:13 - interested in giving it a try you can go
88:15 - to - late comm slash coding training
88:17 - that lets them know that you found out
88:18 - about it from here you can sign up for
88:20 - free this will give you a 30 day free
88:22 - trial of the premium features and then
88:24 - you can also 'if you were to choose to
88:26 - purchase that get 10% off so I'm gonna
88:28 - take a short break
88:29 - a little intermission and if you feel so
88:32 - inclined you can use that time to sign
88:33 - up for - Lane otherwise we'll be back in
88:35 - about five minutes with more I'm gonna
88:39 - do just like probably one or two more
88:41 - quick tutorials about p5 vectors okay
88:45 - how do I do this I go to my intromission
88:48 - button I put on this music and I mute my
88:52 - microphone and go get some water and
88:55 - breathe in some oxygen see you soon
89:01 - [Music]
89:32 - sorry I just had the mic muted I'm all
89:34 - messed up now it says intermission
89:36 - excellent okay see you soon

96:02 - this star this star the star this starts
96:04 - I'll never forget the Vista but somebody
96:07 - composed that song for me okay here I am
96:10 - back thank you again to - lean and I'm
96:15 - ready to continue this vector stuff come
96:18 - back in full energy oh no no no no for
96:21 - very low energy
96:24 - I actually do feel quite a bit tired in
96:27 - a way like I do feel like maybe what
96:29 - might make sense I'm not really prepared
96:33 - to do this right now and I and I and
96:34 - since I have a kind of I have to be
96:36 - finished at noon I don't think I'm gonna
96:37 - do this but I could imagine a world
96:41 - where I if I do a two and A two to
96:43 - two-and-a-half hour live stream where
96:45 - the first hour is the nature of code
96:47 - tutorials and then the second hour is a
96:49 - coding challenge so maybe that's
96:50 - something that I can consider I know a
96:52 - lot of people especially David have
96:54 - helped with this wheel spinning thing
96:56 - I've been working on I just haven't been
96:58 - able to get rid spin the wheel though
97:00 - for the next coding in the Cabana video
97:02 - since that's coming out tomorrow maybe I
97:04 - can do that is the noise suppression
97:06 - gone the noise suppression was never on
97:12 - so I don't know why that's something it
97:15 - would have changed it might just be
97:16 - louder in here there's like the air is
97:18 - kind of come on stronger
97:26 - okay go have a walk all right but I'm I
97:33 - do have so I lost my momentum by taking
97:35 - a break I feel kind of tired but I can
97:37 - get it back I regularly teach three hour
97:39 - classes so I don't know why and
97:42 - regularly and not regularly but I have
97:44 - done longer live streams but here we go
97:46 - okay so I think what I want to cover
97:54 - next is
97:56 - [Music]
98:05 - I don't know if I really want to do a
98:08 - general video about just vector math I
98:13 - feel like I'd rather have it come up as
98:16 - I build the examples so I think that's
98:21 - what I'm gonna keep going
98:33 - yeah
98:38 - oh all right
98:54 - all right
98:57 - I just see the last comment of the chat
99:00 - so let's get to it already
99:02 - it doesn't really motivate me to get
99:03 - started okay Adrian asks have you ever
99:10 - drank energy drinks I don't think that I
99:12 - should be having energy drinks I think
99:14 - my regular level of energy you know a
99:17 - little caffeine never hurts I like I
99:20 - enjoy caffeine just as much as the next
99:22 - person but any other amount of anything
99:26 - that's going to boost energy is just
99:28 - gonna cause me to there's like a little
99:31 - like teetering teetering teetering and I
99:33 - don't want to take another step oh maybe
99:37 - I could do a quick example the dot
99:38 - product projection
99:39 - Oh Joseph Clayton I am not that far
99:42 - along yet that is definitely part of
99:45 - this whole discussion but that that that
99:51 - I think is above and beyond where I am
99:53 - currently in terms of this material
99:54 - there
100:02 - okay I need to what I do need to do on
100:06 - if I'm live starting the morning is eat
100:08 - a bigger breakfast exactly marchello
100:13 - says dangerous
100:15 - just call me don't call me thank you to
100:25 - random hamster with your donation you
100:32 - have won me talking about vector
100:36 - addition all right we're how to begin
100:52 - this
100:58 - all right I know what to do I got it
101:12 - welcome back to the second video in
101:15 - Chapter 1 about vectors in p5.js hi so I
101:20 - could go in a number of different
101:21 - directions here and I'm still sort of
101:23 - figuring out what direction was good
101:24 - right now but ostensibly if you're
101:26 - looking following the nature of codebook
101:28 - along with these videos the next topic
101:30 - is really looking at vector math what
101:32 - are the kinds of operations that you
101:35 - might be used to doing with scalar
101:37 - quantities five plus two equals seven
101:40 - five minus two equals three x square
101:44 - root power of three all of these kinds
101:47 - of mathematical operations those
101:49 - mathematical operations exist for
101:51 - vectors as well
101:52 - and a lot of times it's as simple as
101:54 - vector addition is the same as scalar
101:57 - addition but you just add the X's and
101:58 - you add the Y's and that's really where
102:00 - I'm gonna start but what I think I
102:02 - prefer to do is rather than go through a
102:04 - laundry list which is how the book does
102:08 - this to a bit more extent of of vector
102:11 - math one at a time I'm going to take the
102:14 - next step in the random Locker example
102:17 - and discover what kinds of vector math I
102:20 - need as I'm going and start to talk
102:23 - about the different functions vector
102:24 - math functions I need as I get to them
102:26 - so but you might want to look and sort
102:29 - of wonder like what are all the things
102:31 - that I can do with vectors and one of
102:33 - the reasons to use the p5 vector class
102:36 - beyond just your own x and y variables
102:38 - is that all of these common operations
102:40 - exist as functions in the p5 vector
102:43 - class itself like add subtract multiply
102:46 - divide magnitude magnitude squared dot
102:49 - product cross product distance
102:51 - normalized limit heading rotate so many
102:53 - so many things so I expect that over the
102:56 - course of many many videos throughout
102:58 - this whole series I will get to a lot of
103:00 - these but you also might just take a
103:02 - moment to pause and click through and
103:03 - look at some of these yourself okay
103:17 - all right
103:42 - I'm sorry I'm just enjoying the chat I'm
103:43 - reading it but not reading it loud I'm
103:45 - just enjoying it to myself I want to
103:50 - show you my hilbert Dilbert curb thing
103:52 - that I made before I leave I'll show you
103:56 - a little a little teaser little teaser
103:57 - of the hilbert curve video that's coming
103:59 - out tomorrow one thing I like about
104:02 - doing these coding in the Cabana videos
104:04 - is I love all the stuff that I do and
104:07 - but sometimes it feels a little bit like
104:08 - okay Here I am releasing a new video
104:10 - that's the same thing that I did two
104:11 - weeks ago livestream so I do like the
104:14 - fact that it's like it hasn't no one's
104:15 - seen it yet and if you're thinking about
104:17 - joining as a member I will share it
104:20 - hopefully you know we're kind of like
104:21 - getting into the it's gonna be like up
104:23 - it's gonna be ready like a bit
104:25 - last-minute but I try to I would
104:26 - actually I definitely want to share it
104:28 - with the members first in case there's
104:30 - like a glaring error in it which none of
104:31 - us Swift's or working on and have caught
104:37 - okay do I like corn cakes no but I do
104:44 - Stan the king cake baby and if you
104:48 - happen to know what I'm talking about
104:49 - the fact that I stand the king cake baby
104:52 - as you know that reference you know you
104:57 - can at me
105:00 - Gen X here I'm really really really
105:05 - doing a good job okay
105:20 - so in the random Walker example there
105:22 - happens to be some vector math going on
105:25 - I am taking the X component of the
105:27 - position vector the Y component of the
105:29 - position vector and adding a random
105:30 - number to it
105:40 - so let's start by discussing vector
105:44 - addition
106:00 - let's say I have two vectors and often
106:02 - in a let's say have two vectors and in
106:08 - math textbook scenario often vectors are
106:11 - written as y-a let's say that I have two
106:16 - vectors we'll call them U and V actually
106:18 - you know that's a very the U and V the
106:20 - way I write U and V it always looks too
106:22 - similar let's just call them a and b
106:24 - vector a and vector B and vector
106:27 - notation that you might see in a your
106:28 - math textbook often uses the arrow on
106:32 - top of the letter to say this this
106:34 - represents the vector a this represents
106:37 - the vector B and let's say the vector a
106:39 - is 3 comma 4 and let's say the vector B
106:44 - is I don't know 2 comma negative 1 I
106:51 - want to examine what do I mean when I
106:54 - say vector A plus vector B so this is
106:58 - actually a really simple operation to do
107:00 - because the answer if this was C
107:02 - actually just involves adding the
107:05 - components together so this would be 5
107:07 - comma 3 because 3 plus 2 is 5 and 4 plus
107:10 - negative 100 4 minus 1 is 3 incidentally
107:13 - while we're here I'll just say that a
107:16 - minus B vector subtraction is also what
107:20 - you probably imagined it would be the X
107:22 - component minus the X component the Y
107:23 - component minus the Y component and this
107:25 - would extend into any dimensional space
107:27 - if my vector had 10 numbers in it it
107:29 - would be the same thing so this would be
107:31 - 1 comma 4 minus negative 1 is 4 plus 1
107:35 - which is 5 so these are how these
107:37 - operations actually work
107:44 - however while this is so incredibly
107:47 - simple I think it's worth taking a
107:49 - moment to actually look at how this
107:52 - appears in a diagram because this really
107:55 - relates to how we're using vectors in a
107:57 - 2d p5 canvas so let's stick with our
108:07 - upside-down p5 space there's no demi
108:11 - Gorgons here we'll be fine
108:14 - that reference is totally not gonna
108:16 - matter um so at some point in the future
108:20 - this is zero zero and I'm suggesting
108:23 - that a a we're oh wait how do I want to
108:28 - do this no no no no no never mind
108:31 - I don't want to get into position and
108:37 - velocity just yet the Debbie Gorgon
108:42 - reference will not make it into the
108:43 - edited video go back well maybe it will
108:46 - maybe I'll add it back in uh-huh
108:51 - let's think about our Cartesian space
108:54 - the one where Y points up not the
108:56 - upside-down one with that Demi Gorgon in
108:58 - it and we have the vector a which I can
109:05 - think of as I'm not gonna draw let's
109:21 - think about our carts two dimensional
109:22 - Cartesian space the one where Y points
109:24 - up and X points to the right so not the
109:28 - upside-down one what would be Gorgon in
109:30 - it no Demi gordon's here and so the
109:34 - vector three comma four would be one two
109:37 - three whoops
109:38 - one two three four so this is vector a
109:43 - and vector B is 1 2 and negative 1 so
109:49 - this is vector B so a and B adding
109:54 - vectors the resulting vector C
109:57 - which is a plus B is the vector that
110:00 - point that that results from putting
110:02 - these two end to end so it doesn't
110:04 - matter which one I do first but I'll
110:09 - start with any and then I'm going to put
110:12 - B on the end and B was 2 negative 1 so
110:16 - like this that's B that means this
110:19 - vector here is C this is the resulting
110:23 - vector that you get from a plus B
110:28 - incidentally the vector you get from a
110:31 - minus B would be just take be the same B
110:35 - and put it in the negative direction
110:37 - because this is like representing minus
110:40 - B and then the result of a minus B would
110:44 - be this vector so in that case which
110:46 - vector goes on the end of which is quite
110:47 - important because a minus B is quite
110:49 - different than B minus a or is a plus B
110:51 - and P plus a are the same the reason why
110:57 - I mention this is because now if we go
111:00 - to our upside-down world the world of P
111:02 - 5 and I have this idea of a position the
111:08 - position vector which gives us
111:10 - instructions of how to get from the
111:12 - origin to some location in the canvas
111:15 - and what I want to do is have this thing
111:18 - move animate live in a physics world and
111:22 - respond to forces that's where I'm going
111:23 - with this I want to add to the concept
111:28 - of position I want to add the concept of
111:30 - velocity and if this happened to be
111:32 - velocity then the neck if I take
111:35 - velocity and add it to position then and
111:37 - restore that back into position then I
111:40 - have a new position and then I do it
111:41 - again I take that velocity and add it
111:44 - again and then I have a new position so
111:47 - the object the Walker so to speak is
111:50 - moving from position to position
111:51 - position while adding the velocity over
111:54 - and over again now if that velocity
111:56 - should ever change that's gonna make
111:58 - things much more interesting but let's
112:00 - just start with this concept
112:09 - okay
112:11 - [Applause]
112:24 - so I am going to add to my walker a
112:30 - variable called ve L for velocity I'm
112:34 - going to say create vector and I'm just
112:36 - gonna hard code something in it just to
112:38 - see that right now I'm gonna say 1 comma
112:40 - 0 then now what I'm essentially saying
112:45 - is that these numbers these random
112:48 - numbers that I was picking in the random
112:49 - Walker example that I was adding to
112:51 - position out x position not Y those are
112:53 - the equivalent of the components of the
112:55 - velocity vector so if I add put replace
113:06 - those with the x and y components of
113:08 - this dive velocity now I have what do I
113:10 - have I have a dot that's moving to the
113:14 - right I should probably change it from a
113:17 - dot so it's a little easier to see to an
113:20 - ellipse
113:34 - and let's run this sketch oh and let me
113:40 - know how also erase the background
113:42 - because ultimately the random the idea
113:44 - of the trail of the Ren Walker was where
113:47 - I was before that example but now I'm
113:49 - moving into a body that's going to
113:50 - hopefully eventually respond to physics
113:52 - and I think this visually makes more
113:59 - sense with background and draw there we
114:04 - go
114:04 - this object is moving this circle is
114:11 - moving by its velocity this circles this
114:15 - circles position is changing according
114:17 - to its velocity every cycle through draw
114:26 - I'm gonna change this now to 1 comma
114:28 - negative 1 and can you imagine which
114:32 - direction it's gonna go when I hit play
114:33 - think about it did you say up and to the
114:38 - right if you did you're right I could
114:42 - make it random and so I could put like
114:44 - some random numbers in here but ah this
114:47 - is a nice boat oh wait no no this is not
114:49 - where I want to go next it's not where I
114:54 - want to go next what time is it 11:26
114:59 - okay oh how I am missing something so
115:06 - important here though the whole point of
115:09 - where I started all this discussion was
115:11 - looking at the reference and talking
115:13 - about vector math and how they're all
115:15 - these functions for common vector math
115:17 - operations like the ad function but I'm
115:19 - not using the add function why aren't I
115:21 - using the add function well here is the
115:24 - most confusing aspect of this looking at
115:27 - this you see this dot paws dot x equals
115:30 - itself plus this dot velocity X it's
115:33 - just like x equals x plus speed maybe as
115:40 - a next step comment these out and just
115:43 - say this dot paws equals this dot paws
115:46 - plus this dot velocity ultimately this
115:49 - is what I'm doing right to add the
115:52 - velocity to the position
115:53 - yeah the components together but I don't
115:55 - care about the components I just want to
115:57 - add this vector to this vector so just
115:58 - add those vectors together let's run the
116:00 - code why not let's see what happens
116:05 - isn't it nice how JavaScript just like
116:07 - does it give you any errors like I don't
116:10 - know you try to do something whatever I
116:12 - couldn't do it
116:13 - I just won't draw anything I wish I had
116:18 - an error here because the error I would
116:20 - want it to give me would say I don't
116:22 - know how to use the plus operator with
116:25 - p5 dot vector I wish that I did and I
116:28 - personally need to hand wishes that
116:30 - JavaScript there was a way for me to
116:32 - tell it how to use the plot plus
116:34 - operator with p5 dot vector and some
116:36 - programming languages do allow you to
116:39 - overload what the operators do I think
116:42 - C++ is one maybe but javascript is not
116:44 - one it knows no more how to add these
116:47 - two vectors together that it would two
116:49 - fonts or two p v dot images and so in
116:53 - order to add them together we need to
116:55 - instead of using the plus operator I
116:58 - don't know why I'm coming over here but
116:59 - we need to use the add function and all
117:04 - of the vector math operations that I use
117:07 - over and over again probably throughout
117:08 - these videos I need to find a function
117:11 - in there that does that operation
117:20 - breaking news I'm being told that Python
117:22 - also allows you to overload the operator
117:27 - so instead of this so instead of this so
117:36 - instead of this I will say this dot
117:40 - pause dot add this dot velocity it's a
117:44 - bit of a mouthful it's kind of a lot of
117:46 - dots here but let's just take a moment
117:48 - to breathe this in ultimately if you
117:51 - forget about the this dots for a little
117:54 - bit I'm saying a dot add be right back
117:57 - to this example of two vectors a and B
118:00 - I've got a not add B add B to a add B to
118:06 - a add this object's velocity to this
118:09 - object's position
118:16 - and now when I run it we've got what we
118:20 - had before I can delete all this extra
118:25 - code and here we are
118:48 - [Laughter]
118:51 - Zachary McArthur writes forget about the
118:53 - dis dot there's a whole song about never
118:54 - forgetting that this dots indeed indeed
118:56 - there is okay what else do I want to say
119:03 - here I know what I want to do
119:22 - I mean I really could be done like this
119:24 - is the end here and the next I mean the
119:28 - things that I need let's make a list of
119:29 - the things I need to talk about if I go
119:34 - to the chapter it could be a good
119:36 - reference did subtraction I mean I
119:39 - should ah yes
119:40 - okay I mean I definitely want to talk
119:45 - about magnitude and normalize
119:56 - and then addict celebration in this is
120:05 - the thing that I'm trying to figure out
120:06 - when I want to talk about so I think I
120:12 - want to do a whole separate video about
120:15 - the static and non-static things so
120:23 - that's not gonna come up now I guess
120:25 - guess what I'll do is do a little bit of
120:28 - an aside about getting a random vector I
120:31 - mean where that could be yeah I think
120:40 - there's this really nice thing that I
120:42 - want to show which is how it's different
120:44 - to pick a rant a vector that has the X
120:47 - and y between negative 1 1 and actually
120:50 - picking a random vector of length 1 so
120:55 - that I can show that I can do with like
120:57 - bolt that I can use like multiply and
120:59 - talk about normalize with so does that
121:01 - like a separate video I'm so confused
121:05 - because this is okay I think this is
121:07 - gonna I think I should wrap this one up
121:09 - go and sleep when will you talk about
121:13 - cross and dot product 2021 that's
121:16 - probably about how much time it'll take
121:18 - me to get to it unless I quit all the
121:22 - other things I'm doing in my life and
121:24 - just make these videos every day then
121:25 - I'll be then I'll be talking about it
121:26 - next Wednesday
121:35 - all right
121:39 - okay okay no no I'm gonna just like
121:48 - yeah I'm gonna just blip this in here
121:51 - all right
121:56 - okay one thing you might be asking
122:02 - yourself right now before I'm anyway I'm
122:05 - pretty much finished with this but one
122:06 - thing you might be asking yourself right
122:07 - now anything it's worth sort of like
122:08 - tacking this on here no no no I'm gonna
122:11 - do this in a separate video I think
122:14 - should be short they should have the
122:15 - thing in and they want
122:17 - I'm not putting ads on them so it
122:19 - doesn't matter if there's like five
122:20 - videos in a row that's opposed to just
122:21 - one so that's what I'm gonna do
122:37 - so this ends so this is the end of this
122:40 - piece in the sense that I've talked
122:41 - about what vector math is it's taking a
122:43 - mathematical operation and applying it
122:45 - to vectors ad being a primary example or
122:48 - at least our first example of that and
122:49 - the concept of velocity as being a
122:52 - vector that changes the position over
122:55 - time one question you might be asking
122:58 - yourself is well what if I wanted to go
123:00 - back to that random walk and have the
123:01 - velocity be random every frame like how
123:03 - would I go about doing that and I think
123:05 - I want it like that's what and I think I
123:08 - want to cover that in a separate video
123:09 - because there's actually a really
123:10 - interesting thing that happens when you
123:12 - pick random vectors as opposed to
123:15 - picking random an x and y values
123:16 - separately and I want to show that in a
123:19 - video on its own so I'm gonna do that
123:21 - next and then once I finish with that I
123:24 - will come back and start looking at and
123:29 - once I finish with that I will come back
123:31 - and start looking at other vector math
123:33 - operations magnitude normalize multiply
123:37 - in the context of setting and
123:40 - acceleration for our random Walker so it
123:43 - doesn't just have a position and a
123:45 - velocity but it also has an acceleration
123:47 - so I'll see you there okay
123:55 - Raphael Alfaro says my cousin is a
123:58 - student at ITP trying to think of who
124:02 - your cousin could be alright do I have
124:06 - time yes I'm gonna do the next one this
124:10 - is gonna be a separate sketch for a
124:12 - second
124:22 - come on Internet don't fail me now
124:33 - Oh No Oh No
124:39 - did this save mm-hmm I mean this was
124:45 - pretty easy to recreate it's a temporary
124:47 - glitch oh boy this is like um snow day
124:58 - it's equivalent of snow day p-5 web
125:00 - editor down somewhere in the depths of
125:03 - my computer I have the keys to reboot
125:05 - the server but I think it's really down
125:10 - you know what happened did I break it
125:12 - did we break it somebody watching it
125:16 - strolling this channel crashing the
125:18 - server and purpose that would be very
125:21 - sad for everybody all around do I get to
125:24 - go home early today if if it doesn't
125:28 - come back I'm gonna show you the hilbert
125:30 - curve and get going I mean I could do
125:33 - this obviously without the p5 web editor
125:35 - but I don't want to
125:46 - the definition of insanity is doing the
125:50 - same thing over and over again and
125:51 - expecting a different result is that to
125:53 - whose quote is that can I show you guys
126:00 - I should show you guys mice my son is
126:02 - learning scratch and him and my daughter
126:04 - is also learning scratch she's a little
126:05 - bit younger so she hasn't really
126:07 - she just started where he's been doing
126:09 - it for quite a while
126:10 - he made this game which was really cool
126:13 - but I don't have the link to it all
126:15 - right
126:22 - first of all did you know that there's
126:24 - an alpha version of processing for and
126:34 - Albert Hilbert render let's see what is
126:39 - in these so this is the example that
126:46 - decoding in the Cabana video goes
126:49 - through I just want to change something
126:56 - I'm gonna zoom way in here you can see
126:59 - what it's drawing here this continuous
127:02 - path this is called a space-filling
127:08 - curve this is one single continuous line
127:18 - I can see it going and going and going
127:19 - we can just watch it Mizzou back out and
127:24 - actually what I'm sorry one thing I was
127:25 - working on that we're trying to decide
127:27 - whether it should actually go in the
127:29 - video because it's very hard to see this
127:31 - at the end when I finish it shoot how do
127:35 - I just give me a second here because
127:40 - this is gonna oh this is actually
127:44 - another thing I was trying to do
127:52 - who has an error
128:10 - well shoot I wanted to show you this
128:12 - thing
128:24 - p5 editors back ok oops p5 editors back
128:30 - I wanted to show you this other thing
128:32 - but oh so I'm really excited for the
128:36 - hilbert curve because i think it's a
128:37 - really good project for people to make
128:40 - their own oh yeah that's back to make
128:42 - their own I'm just gonna copy paste this
128:53 - yeah I'm gonna have to leave the site
128:55 - it's a really good project for people to
128:58 - make their own variations of
129:08 - let's try
129:11 - so one thing is if you haven't joined
129:13 - the discord please join the discord
129:18 - because we're planning to kind of
129:22 - organize around the hilbert curve there
129:24 - and have people make lots of art
129:26 - projects and creative variations of it
129:28 - so join for that I don't know why I
129:33 - can't get the editor back I'm gonna
129:35 - restart my browser
129:53 - oh and gone again yeah oh that was
129:58 - interesting let's log in - Lane oops
130:04 - wrong button get it the right button
130:12 - well
130:21 - well well well not not good
130:32 - you know what's going on
130:40 - processing foundation does has very very
130:42 - limited resources to main maintain these
130:44 - free and open source tools and so I
130:48 - would encourage you to support the
130:51 - processing foundation which you can do
130:53 - to do on the support website I believe
130:57 - also this is still active if I go to the
131:02 - coding train and go here I think I you
131:06 - at at I created a YouTube fundraiser for
131:09 - the processing foundation I should just
131:11 - put it on all high videos frankly but at
131:14 - least on this one if I click on it oh
131:18 - where is the fundraiser how come it
131:24 - doesn't show usually the fundraiser
131:26 - shows up here did it end maybe am i
131:30 - zoomed in
131:35 - I don't know why I don't see the front
131:37 - click no joy no subscribed I don't know
131:42 - why the fundraiser isn't there I wonder
131:44 - if it speak like by accident this like
131:46 - member thing is overlaying it but anyway
131:49 - but hopefully you could find that
131:51 - YouTube fundraiser processing foundation
131:53 - wait ah look you came back right okay
132:01 - alright I got ten minutes before I gotta
132:03 - go oh I just want to see is this where
132:15 - it was yeah that's where it was okay
132:16 - great so I want to make a new sketch and
132:22 - we call this random vectors and let's
132:28 - just say
132:51 - sorry I'm thinking about how I want to
132:53 - do this actually this could be the video
133:03 - both about static functions and not
133:09 - static functions but give me a second
133:12 - here oh there's a lot that I could do by
133:17 - doing this example so just give me a
133:21 - second here line
134:02 - okay alright that kind of threw me for a
134:10 - little bit of a loop there cuz I don't
134:11 - have a ton of time but let me see what I
134:16 - can do here
134:22 - okay
134:29 - don't want to call this I'm doing the
134:32 - random thing and the static thing it's
134:33 - kind of like two topics should I do them
134:41 - separately I'm making them separately
134:53 - okay
134:55 - all right
134:57 - okay
135:00 - hi so this is another video about
135:03 - working with p5 dot vector and create
135:06 - vector and p5 Jess hi so this is another
135:10 - video about working with p5 dot vector
135:12 - and creep it let's say you think why do
135:15 - I want to change this thing hi so this
135:21 - is another video about working with
135:22 - vectors in p5.js
135:24 - so I want to demonstrate something in
135:26 - this video which is about picking random
135:29 - vectors no no
135:43 - hello welcome to another video about
135:46 - working with vectors in p5 GS so the
135:49 - topic of this one is I want to just look
135:51 - at what it means to create a random
135:53 - vector and some things that come up with
135:55 - that I in the way I'm opening up a bit a
135:57 - bit of a can of vector e workers but I
136:00 - think this is gonna veer off into a
136:01 - bunch of different math functions I
136:02 - might need it also is gonna veer into
136:05 - the territory of talking about something
136:06 - called a static function but I'm gonna
136:09 - try to just shoot but I'm gonna try to
136:14 - take this slow and just look at creating
136:16 - a random vector for a moment so looking
136:20 - at this this
136:40 - deep breath I'm gonna start this
136:46 - discussion by looking at this example
136:48 - that has two vectors a vector called
136:51 - I need Simon is telling me that I didn't
137:00 - do vector multiplication exactly that's
137:02 - exactly what I'm going to end up needing
137:04 - to do and magnitude all this is gonna
137:06 - come up this is how I'm doing it okay
137:12 - it's not cold in here it's warm the
137:18 - example that I'm going to work with
137:20 - starts with just two variables v1 and v2
137:24 - and they're two vectors one with X&Y of
137:26 - 200 200 one with X&Y of 100 zero so what
137:29 - I'm doing in this is I'm drawing a line
137:31 - between the location opposite I'm
137:34 - drawing the line between the position v1
137:37 - x v1 dot y and the result of adding v1
137:42 - and v2 together well well let me just
137:47 - start this whole thing over
138:31 - Oh
138:43 - I can't do this without this the static
138:46 - thing is making me crazy I really just
138:48 - need to I think I need to do the I you
138:50 - know anything through the static one
138:52 - first or I should just be less crazy
138:55 - about this you know what I got it I got
138:58 - it everybody oh I'm such a doodoo doodoo
139:01 - face I know what I'm gonna do I have a
139:07 - much simpler way of doing this
139:32 - I got it I want to do the other thing
139:36 - but I need to talk about static
139:37 - functions that's why it was okay there
139:44 - we go okay
140:03 - hello so this is another video on
140:06 - working with vectors and p5.js and in
140:08 - this video I really just want to talk
140:09 - about what it means to make a random
140:11 - vector which seems like why is there
140:13 - even a whole video about that but I have
140:14 - a point to this which I will get to um
140:17 - it also was I think useful because it's
140:19 - kind of opening up this can of worms
140:20 - vector e worms which I want to open up
140:22 - because I'm gonna end up looking at some
140:24 - other math functions that I need it's
140:25 - gonna lead me to something about static
140:28 - functions but that'll be in the next
140:29 - video right now I just want to look at
140:31 - this example that I have and what I have
140:33 - here is first of all notice I'm
140:34 - translating the coordinate space to the
140:37 - center of the canvas this is very
140:38 - important because I want to treat just
140:40 - for this visual demonstration I want to
140:41 - treat zero zero as the center of this
140:43 - canvas then I'm making a vector with an
140:45 - X component of 100 and a Y component of
140:48 - zero and I'm representing the vector as
140:51 - a line from zero zero to the x and y so
140:53 - it would be nice if I could draw a
140:54 - little hat on the end so it looks like
140:56 - an arrow but that's gonna be too much
140:59 - work I could change these numbers you
141:01 - know negative 150 and you can see
141:03 - there's my line so let's just think
141:06 - about first what would it mean to pick a
141:09 - random vector
141:10 - well the first instinct might be this
141:12 - which is a very reasonable instinct
141:14 - let's make a vector that has between
141:16 - negative 100 and 100 as it's X and this
141:19 - is gonna start getting very long I'm
141:21 - gonna have to drag this way over
141:23 - negative 100 as it's y that's like the
141:27 - range of stuff that I'm picking and if I
141:29 - run the sketch you know every single
141:32 - frame it is picking a new value for x
141:35 - and y and I'm seeing that line point
141:36 - often in directions so this is a random
141:39 - vector generator in a way and but I want
141:44 - to show you something a little bit odd
141:45 - which is that if I take background 0 and
141:48 - put it into setup what do you expect to
141:51 - see I'm going to see collect over time
141:55 - every single vector that points from
141:58 - anywhere from 0 0 to what something with
142:02 - an x and y minimum maximum between
142:04 - negative 100 100 let's run this I'm
142:08 - gonna let this play out for a little bit
142:31 - look at that result I am seeing all of
142:36 - the vectors fill up a square it's the
142:40 - worst drawn square ever write any vector
142:42 - this vector this vector this vector this
142:45 - vector right because minimum maximum
142:50 - this is you know this is zero zero
143:08 - in many cases when working with vectors
143:11 - however it's quite common that you want
143:14 - to pick a vector with a random direction
143:18 - but a fixed magnitude what do I mean by
143:21 - that here the direction and the
143:23 - magnitude it's all random and the
143:24 - magnitude even has kind of this
143:26 - arbitrary range because this is the
143:28 - longest vector possible but if I go to
143:30 - extend to here this one is actually
143:32 - shorter what would it mean for me to
143:35 - pick vectors that fill out a circle well
143:40 - there is something in that there is
143:44 - something called a unit vector and a
143:49 - unit vector is a kind of vector which
143:52 - really just a unit vector is a vector
143:56 - that talks about that the unit vector is
144:01 - a vector of length one that's the unit
144:03 - with any with with any direction so it's
144:07 - a kind of vector that you use when you
144:08 - only really want to talk about the
144:09 - direction then the magnet doesn't matter
144:11 - let's just pick one as a standard and
144:13 - let's now pick a direction so what if I
144:16 - wanted to pick any unit vector any
144:18 - vector of length one but in any
144:20 - direction
144:21 - whoops so I could start to look into
144:24 - some trigonometry math to do this and I
144:26 - will come to that soon enough but
144:30 - instead of instead of had you know but
144:35 - one of the benefits of working with
144:36 - vectors in p5.js is there's a function
144:39 - that'll pick a random unit vector for
144:40 - you and that function is just called
144:47 - random 2d because I want a random 2d
144:50 - vector V equals P v dot vector dot
144:56 - random 2d now there's something really
145:00 - odd about this which is I'm calling this
145:02 - function random 2d p v dot vector dot
145:06 - random 2d la what is all that so this is
145:09 - veering off into this other topic about
145:11 - static functions and I'm gonna talk
145:14 - about that and cover that in the next
145:15 - video but for right now let's just
145:17 - understand this as a function that
145:19 - returns a
145:20 - random unit vector so now if I were to
145:23 - run this Oh what's going on here oh look
145:31 - at all those random unit vectors they're
145:32 - all of length one well I can't really
145:34 - visually see what's going on because one
145:36 - pixel isn't very much I could use a
145:38 - scale I could try using the scale
145:39 - function to kind of blow things up but
145:41 - this is a really nice opportunity for me
145:44 - to talk about another vector math
145:46 - function multiply where we timewise all
145:53 - the good is they gotta go I'm gonna
145:55 - finish this out
146:13 - I think I had this by the way something
146:16 - like this remember when I had vectors a
146:18 - and B and I said a plus B is add the X's
146:23 - together add the Y's together and I'll
146:25 - get eight comma three that's dessert the
146:28 - numbers I used before but I think this
146:29 - math is correct now and and and the
146:32 - function in p5 to do this was added now
146:38 - what if I wanted to use the idea of
146:40 - multiplication with vectors oh my
146:42 - goodness could I say a times B I kind of
146:46 - can but vector multiplication the vector
146:50 - product is a whole other topic that I'll
146:54 - cover eventually but you might have
146:56 - heard of things like the dot product or
146:58 - the cross product or the hard meru how
147:01 - what's that called the hat miroux
147:04 - the heart no that's Hadamard product or
147:14 - even something called the Hadamard
147:16 - product but I'm not covering those now
147:20 - when I say vector multiplication I'm
147:23 - talking about scaling a vector well when
147:26 - I say multiplication when I'm referring
147:29 - to this function in p5 called mult for
147:32 - multiply I'm talking about scaling the
147:35 - vector multiplying the vector by a
147:37 - scalar quantity so in other words I'm
147:39 - talking about saying a times not another
147:43 - vector but like the number 2 and what do
147:46 - I mean when I say that if I have a
147:47 - vector that's pointing in a given
147:49 - direction with a given magnitude like 3
147:53 - so let's actually make it 5 because I'm
147:56 - gonna use the 3 4 5 triangle if I
147:59 - multiply it by 2 now I have that same
148:01 - vector so it's sorry no I have a
148:03 - different vector but it's the same
148:05 - direction with lengths twice as much so
148:08 - the length of this vector is 10 and the
148:10 - way that this works is if it's a three
148:12 - four five if the components are three
148:17 - and four because it's a 3 4 5 triangle
148:20 - then all I have to do is multiply each
148:22 - component so if I want to take a and
148:24 - multiply it by 2
148:26 - the vector I would get is 6 comma 8 3
148:30 - times 2 4.com times 2 so in this case
148:37 - after I picked this random unit vector
148:39 - which has length 1 I can scale it to any
148:42 - quantity by saying V multiplied 100 and
148:45 - think about what's gonna happen now I'm
148:47 - gonna run this sketch and I get any
148:50 - vector always of length 100 pointing in
148:53 - any direction this opens up incidentally
148:56 - a lot of possible just like visual
148:57 - possibilities just from this alone and
148:59 - certainly I could change this and say Oh
149:02 - any vector between 50 and 100 and I
149:05 - should probably give this some alpha to
149:06 - sort of see and we can see now I have
149:10 - any vector it's a minimum length 50
149:13 - maximum length 100 and just from that
149:15 - I'm getting this sort of like nice
149:16 - visualization that would be harder to do
149:19 - without these built-in functions in
149:21 - vectors but so this though there's a lot
149:33 - more to this I might return back it
149:36 - might be useful now to return back to
149:37 - this random Walker example and I can see
149:40 - now I'm sorry before I move on let's
149:47 - just quickly move back to this Walker
149:49 - example and see that I could now say
149:51 - this top velocity equals P 5 vector
149:55 - random 2d and this would now be a way of
150:00 - taking a Walker and every time I run the
150:02 - sketch it's going to go in a random
150:04 - direction the speed the magnitude of the
150:07 - velocity is always going to be one so I
150:09 - could also randomize that to some value
150:14 - between like zero and three whoops this
150:19 - dot velocity dot multiplied whoops
150:24 - and now you're seeing just another way
150:27 - of thinking about how you might
150:29 - initialize something with randomness and
150:31 - maybe Perlin noise could play a role
150:33 - here is there some way you can create an
150:35 - array of all these walkers with initial
150:38 - velocities according to Perlin noise if
150:40 - you go back and look at my Perlin noise
150:41 - videos that might create some
150:42 - interesting trails you could consider
150:44 - but i'm but but i'm going to stop here
150:46 - and let you do some variations on this
150:49 - now that you see about how random 2d
150:52 - works and multiply works there is
150:55 - another aspect to this though that I
150:56 - want to unpack which is what does it
150:58 - mean to call a function like dot
151:00 - multiply which is on a vector V versus a
151:03 - function like random 2d which is not on
151:05 - a specific vector but on the type of
151:08 - thing itself P v dot vector so I'm gonna
151:10 - come back and that's what that's called
151:11 - a static function I'm gonna cover that
151:13 - in a separate video and then after that
151:15 - we'll be ready to start looking at
151:16 - acceleration and all the other good
151:17 - stuff magnitude and normalize and all
151:19 - that sort of stuff ok so thanks for
151:21 - watching this one and I'll see you in
151:23 - the next one bye
151:24 - [Music]
151:26 - okay alright everyone I've got to go
151:33 - thank you for tuning in I don't know why
151:39 - I don't hear that
151:40 - [Music]
151:42 - oh I hear it now um Oh Valentine's Day
151:47 - coding challenge oh no I know I'm gonna
151:52 - get give me an idea huh shoot all right
151:59 - I've got to go thank you for watching I
152:02 - can try to answer a question or two time
152:05 - assign me to spin the wheel for the
152:06 - command I'm not prepared to do that
152:08 - today so I'll have to do that another
152:10 - time I don't think I have the I don't
152:12 - remember what's on the list I don't have
152:14 - a link to the wheel we need but someday
152:17 - we'll have all sorts of systems like
152:18 - this so these will come out as edited
152:20 - videos okay you know it might take out
152:22 - some time
152:23 - stay tuned you know but I don't I I know
152:27 - I said the videos the hilbert curve
152:30 - Cabana video will be released tomorrow
152:31 - that's the plan but you know let me just
152:34 - say by Monday at the latest sometime
152:37 - this weekend heart curve I did the heart
152:39 - curve last year Marcos you have a good
152:42 - nice weekend also I've got a lot of
152:45 - things going on today what else what
152:47 - sweaters like reminders you can check
152:51 - out the new coding train store as
152:54 - standard TV slash coding train you can
152:58 - add your contributions to your projects
153:03 - you make on the coding train website
153:04 - please join the discord the stay tuned
153:09 - by the way one thing I'll show you is
153:11 - working on some new thumbnails these are
153:13 - sort of in progress when I say I on this
153:15 - were designed by Simon who designs
153:18 - thumbnails for standard although I'm
153:20 - making some tweaks with Jason who did
153:22 - these illustrations but this is the
153:24 - these are the two that I did so far and
153:26 - the hilbert curve should be here very
153:28 - soon what else I think that's it
153:34 - can you do oh I'll be a processing
153:36 - community day tomorrow if any of you are
153:38 - going to prosecute a in New York there's
153:42 - also just sort of like more generally
153:44 - there's community to a worldwide which
153:48 - I'm in the wrong place
153:50 - yes so if you're interested in attending
153:56 - an event where you can meet people in
153:58 - real life take a look at all these
154:01 - community days happen all over the world
154:03 - projectile motion coding challenge
154:05 - that's a great idea so that could be
154:07 - interesting to do some once I get
154:11 - through a lot of these basics to pick
154:12 - sort of a topic that could be a coding
154:15 - challenge that's based on those I like
154:16 - that idea
154:17 - somebody to remind you that have you
154:18 - seen in Twitter I mentioned doing a nice
154:20 - tweet where a I cannot recognize optical
154:23 - illusion between a hare and a duck Alexi
154:26 - I did not see that I'll have to try to
154:28 - take a look for that all right thanks
154:29 - everybody goodbye have a wonderful
154:31 - weekend and I will see you next week
154:35 - hopefully is next week the week that I'm
154:38 - away yes but I'm not leaving till Friday
154:42 - so next week Thursday or Friday there'll
154:44 - be a live stream okay hopefully this is
154:47 - the ending animation
155:13 - [Music]
155:35 - auto-tuned and the internet will fix
155:37 - that
155:51 - [Music]
156:04 - [Music]
156:07 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
156:10 - else is there
156:12 - yes kittens thank you very much
156:15 - kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice
156:17 - that look what I get
156:19 - [Music]
156:37 - [Music]
156:48 - [Music]
157:03 - [Music]
157:30 - [Music]
157:37 - I feel just sort of like a nice feeling
157:41 - of relaxation everything's gonna be okay
157:43 - today dream is not broken it does not
157:46 - frozen this isn't this is a wonderful
157:48 - thing okay we're gonna do I'm really
157:51 - getting something I need my sound
157:56 - [Music]
158:10 - [Music]
158:12 - that was invalid syntax I forgot
158:18 - [Music]
158:23 - generation analysis things
158:26 - [Music]
158:56 - so this is random this is noise Perley
159:00 - noise that is in the core random
159:02 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
159:04 - itself those numbers aren't related at
159:07 - all you pick like I'm picking random
159:09 - numbers between zero and ten nine two
159:11 - seven six one
159:20 - this two three four three four five six
159:24 - five four five six seven five six seven
159:27 - five six seven eight nine eight seven
159:31 - this is like Perlin noise performance
159:33 - part like birthing noise performance
159:48 - apart with curling noise I might pick
159:56 - numbers like this
160:03 - by purling noise that is early noise so
160:06 - this is hurling noise that is Hurley
160:08 - noise this is Hurley noise that it's
160:09 - Hurley no so this is Hurley noise this
160:17 - is but with curly noise I might pick
160:37 - numbers like this
160:38 - [Music]
160:53 - like I always forget to do this this
162:02 - star this star this star this star song
162:04 - never forget the Vista somebody composed
162:07 - that song for me
