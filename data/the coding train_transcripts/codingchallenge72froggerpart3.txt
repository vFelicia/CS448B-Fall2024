00:00 - okay welcome to part three of making
00:02 - Frogger in a way that's terrible and I'm
00:06 - doing a terrible job
00:07 - I'm just trying my best here but
00:09 - hopefully you're learning something or
00:10 - you will make a much better version of
00:11 - this what I have so far in parts wanted
00:14 - to I made the Frog that moves around in
00:16 - parts in part two I added the cars and I
00:20 - also may implemented that if you if you
00:22 - hit one of the logs hit one of the cars
00:25 - I can't get anything straight you it
00:27 - resets the game now there's a lot of
00:29 - nuance to this and you know in terms of
00:31 - visual design and there's a lot of ways
00:34 - this could be improved but I'm just kind
00:35 - of keeping it simple and I look forward
00:36 - to everyone's creative improvements of
00:39 - this but I do need to add something to
00:41 - this all the cars are moving in the same
00:43 - direction and that's not actually how
00:45 - Frogger works on some rows the cars move
00:48 - in the opposite direction so let's
00:49 - before I get into the logs let's at
00:51 - least add that so let's just say what
00:54 - happens if I in Row 2 gives the cars a
00:59 - negative speed so negative 3.5 instead
01:02 - of positive you can see that's working
01:05 - but I don't have the code for them to
01:07 - come back so what I need to do in the
01:09 - car in update is if speed is greater
01:13 - than zero so if they're moving to the
01:17 - right check if they get off that edge
01:20 - else by definition they're moving to the
01:23 - left else if X is less than negative
01:29 - grid then X then x equals a with plus
01:37 - grid right so this is just the opposite
01:40 - of checking instead of checking if
01:42 - they're off that edge if they're moving
01:44 - to the left and you can check if they're
01:45 - off that edge and now we should have
01:47 - yeah there we go so this is much better
01:50 - already
01:52 - just sort of in terms of what's going on
01:54 - okay so then there should be a sort of
01:56 - safety so I'm going to I'll draw these
01:58 - there's like a safety row at the bottom
02:01 - again and really this this project
02:03 - really needs a lane object and the lane
02:06 - keeps track of what's in it and I think
02:08 - that actually I'm going to leave maybe
02:09 - I'll do it like a part four or something
02:11 - that I make
02:11 - that but I just want to visually draw
02:13 - something in for those lanes so I'm
02:15 - going to say a rectangle from zero
02:20 - height minus grid with a full width two
02:27 - with a height of grid and let's give
02:30 - that a sort of I don't know what what
02:34 - color to draw this let's try let's try
02:37 - this okay so we can see that's the
02:40 - safety Lane and maybe maybe I should
02:43 - give it some transparency actually would
02:45 - make more sense so you can see that's
02:49 - the safety laying down here I'm going to
02:53 - add another safety Lane which would be
02:56 - height minus grid times 100 we get you
02:59 - so far
03:00 - we had grid times to grid times 3 grid
03:03 - times 4 so now I'm going to add a safety
03:07 - Lane at grid times 5 there we go
03:09 - so we can see that's a safety Lane okay
03:14 - so now what I need to do is start
03:16 - putting some logs above okay are you
03:20 - ready for logs I'm ready for logs ready
03:24 - for Luke okay so what do I want to do I
03:28 - already have this whole car object could
03:32 - I possibly I think I could get away with
03:35 - having a log extend car right because a
03:39 - log is going to have a speed a log is
03:42 - going to have the same update function a
03:44 - log behaves exactly like a car there
03:46 - will be some difference so let's try
03:49 - saying and it could be a log or a turtle
03:51 - but I'm just going to keep everything
03:52 - along right now I'm going to make a
03:55 - class called log and have it extend car
04:01 - let's see how this goes then what I want
04:04 - to do is what's the car constructor look
04:06 - like this
04:09 - so what I'm going to do is just say
04:11 - super right because log log is created
04:19 - just like a car
04:23 - then okay so there's actually pretty
04:27 - good
04:28 - wait we don't have any different
04:30 - functionality just yet so what I'm going
04:33 - to do is I'm going to create yet another
04:34 - row which will actually be like row it's
04:40 - actually row five technically row I
04:44 - guess if the roads have numbering the
04:46 - rows of the rows are numbered by I let
04:55 - me let me look at what's what's here
04:57 - actually
04:57 - whoops what just happened comment this
05:00 - out my row numbering is horrible zero
05:04 - one two three four and I'm drawing them
05:10 - at but the problem is I'm drawing it
05:13 - from the top so it's really getting
05:15 - drawn at row plus one okay so again I do
05:21 - I can really keep to refactor this whole
05:23 - row Lane saying I'm kind of probably
05:25 - should do it now but I'm just going to
05:27 - keep going so the next one is not at
05:30 - times five that's the safety lane it's
05:33 - at times six but it is row five and I'm
05:38 - going to put two logs in it and I'm
05:41 - gonna say logs I'm going to restart
05:43 - index over at zero and I'm going to put
05:46 - two logs and this should be x not five
05:52 - but times six and we need to have an
05:56 - array called logs and right now I'm
06:00 - going to say I'm just going to say I'm
06:03 - going to just start with two logs and
06:09 - then a lot of people's a new what did I
06:14 - what did I get wrong here logs the log
06:16 - not logs how am i doing that I'm adding
06:20 - the logs now what I'm going to do is I
06:25 - am going to have the same exact loop
06:27 - here but I'm going to do it for all of
06:31 - the logs
06:35 - Blagh so I just want to see do I now
06:39 - have there we go
06:40 - so you can see that those logs are
06:43 - identical now let's change them up let's
06:46 - make those logs have a of that row have
06:51 - a whiff that three-wide let's have them
06:56 - go a bit faster and let's space them out
06:59 - by quite a bit more okay so now we can
07:05 - see and to something else is moving
07:08 - exactly at two let's um so let's move
07:11 - them a little bit faster than that okay
07:13 - so those are the logs now I can't
07:16 - visually how come they're not coming
07:19 - back
07:20 - Oh cars are missing what happened so
07:27 - there was a pretty major bug that most
07:29 - of you probably for at least like five
07:31 - or ten minutes there were probably
07:32 - yelling at your TV television machine I
07:35 - don't know how you watch this stuff if
07:37 - you're even watching it which is that
07:40 - anything moving to the right
07:42 - actually never came back on because of
07:45 - the way that I have this see if speed is
07:48 - greater than zero and otherwise it could
07:52 - still be a thing with speed greater than
07:54 - zero if it's no longer over that so it
07:57 - gets like set back and then it's less so
07:59 - it gets set back over there so it's
08:01 - getting set back and forth so I really
08:03 - need to check it only only want to do I
08:05 - only want to move things back to the
08:08 - other side if there actually are things
08:10 - that are moving to the right so this
08:12 - should really fix that problem and there
08:14 - we go thank you now we have cars and now
08:22 - I'm ready to jump on a log so here's the
08:26 - thing oh my goodness I really need that
08:30 - Lane object right because now I need to
08:32 - know I really want if I mean if I am NOT
08:36 - intersecting a log and I'm up here we've
08:41 - got a problem okay so I'm going to do
08:44 - things very manually where
08:47 - I can really just check the frogs
08:49 - location right I only want to start
08:52 - thinking about the logs if the Frog is
08:55 - where above this safety line what value
08:59 - is that so let's just see if I could get
09:02 - this right I'm going to say if frog
09:08 - if frog dot Y is greater then oh no is
09:16 - less than what was that safety Lane it
09:19 - was grid height minus grid times five
09:25 - height - great I really could have done
09:27 - this from the top sort of a site might
09:29 - think that's right hike - grid times
09:32 - five background let's just test this out
09:36 - ooh I have to get through the cars to
09:40 - test it there we go okay so that's good
09:44 - this is the correct test - now know the
09:48 - gain is over if I'm not intersecting a
09:51 - log so let's figure that out how do I
09:55 - check that boolean so what I need to do
09:58 - is check all logs and if I'm not
10:01 - intersecting any of them so let's do
10:04 - that inside this loop if frog if the
10:09 - Frog is up in that region I'm I'm going
10:14 - to assume that I'm not okay I'm going to
10:17 - assume that I'm not okay I'm not I'm not
10:20 - okay
10:21 - but if log intersects frog or if frog
10:29 - intersects log then okay is true right
10:35 - so now if all of that is done if I say
10:40 - if not okay reset game so one thing I
10:46 - want to do right now is I want to start
10:47 - the Frog in the middle so let me start
10:50 - the Frog in the middle which is
10:52 - is the frog starts at height - grid
10:56 - times 5 right I will just start the Frog
10:59 - there and so if I jump just into the
11:03 - books if I jump into the river but
11:08 - should be able to jump on camera why
11:11 - can't I jump on a log what did I miss
11:13 - here my okay should be out of the loop
11:17 - oh yeah of course
11:20 - so the okay has to be out of the loop of
11:24 - course because I have to start I'm just
11:26 - doing this one time through draw with my
11:28 - frog I mean assume the Frog is okay and
11:31 - this also should be out of the loop
11:35 - right so after all is said and done so
11:39 - this now should allow me to hold on oh
11:46 - wait I'm trying to jump I got it oh I
11:48 - have a problem yeah I'm on a log and now
11:52 - I'm not I'm on a log you can't get so
11:54 - first of all I want to draw the Frog
11:55 - last so I can see what's going on here
11:59 - let me draw the Frog last so you can see
12:03 - I can jump on to the log now why can't I
12:07 - move do I have this wrong should this be
12:10 - times six why can't I move in the safety
12:16 - link Oh No
12:19 - so also of course oh my god crazy a
12:24 - silly obvious problem here now which is
12:26 - that I wonder if I should do this in a
12:30 - separate loop you know what I think I
12:31 - want to do this in a separate loop just
12:33 - for clean just for sort of clarity sake
12:37 - because I always want to here's here's
12:44 - the reason why I always want to show and
12:46 - update all the logs but only want to
12:48 - deal with this frog log intersection
12:50 - thing if the frogs within a certain zone
12:53 - so I'm just going to do this you know
12:55 - big deal let's loop through all the logs
12:57 - twice so I'm going to assume that I'm
13:01 - not okay because clearly I'm not okay
13:05 - okay but assume that I'm not okay I'm
13:08 - gonna go through all the log if I
13:09 - understand the logs I'm going to be okay
13:11 - and only in this instance if I'm not
13:14 - okay I'm going to reset the game so this
13:19 - only happens all of this only happens if
13:22 - I'm within this region over here so now
13:26 - I can move freely I can even move back
13:28 - down but now I I'm no good if I jump
13:33 - into the river but I'm good if I jump on
13:35 - a lot but guess what what's got to
13:37 - happen now if I jump on a log I should
13:41 - move with the log I should move with the
13:43 - log so I need to be attached to a log
13:46 - well this is great so let's have the
13:49 - Frog have a variable part of it which is
13:53 - an attached vlog then I'm going to write
13:57 - a function I'm going to call it attached
14:00 - and I'm going to say attached equals
14:04 - that log so this variable is going to be
14:10 - by definition no at first okay now what
14:16 - I'm going to do is if I intersect that
14:20 - log then I want to say frog attach blog
14:24 - so I want to attach the log to frog to
14:28 - that log I'm also going to need an
14:31 - update function so the Frog needs an
14:34 - update function and the Frog it's funny
14:38 - I thought this would be functionality of
14:40 - the log so far the log doesn't need any
14:42 - additional functionality
14:44 - I'm putting it in the Frog which i think
14:46 - is okay what I need is an update
14:48 - function and if attach is not equal to
14:53 - no so if this frog is attached to some
14:56 - log frog dot X plus equals that log
15:01 - speed it should move according to that
15:04 - log speed of attached speed okay I might
15:10 - need it I don't know that I need a
15:11 - detach function because when I can only
15:13 - be attached to one log at a time
15:15 - and when I jump I'm either going to end
15:17 - up in the river and so I'm going to be
15:19 - the games going to be reset or I'm going
15:21 - to attach to a new log so let's look at
15:24 - this now let me try to jump onto this
15:27 - there we go
15:28 - look at this I'm attached to it jump
15:30 - onto this attack but you can see if I
15:32 - try to jump off I'm reset there's a
15:36 - little bit of an animation issue I
15:37 - really should see myself jump off and
15:39 - see that I'm in the wrong part maybe
15:41 - animate and then and get reset with but
15:43 - let's add let's add some more lanes with
15:46 - some more logs okay so this was row five
15:51 - now I want to add row let's add one more
15:56 - row row six let's put three logs and
16:02 - those logs are less wide and they move
16:06 - in the opposite direction
16:09 - more slowly and they're spaced out by a
16:14 - different amount just like making up
16:18 - random numbers here oops and then if I
16:22 - add three logs I need to make the array
16:24 - have five in it look and those should be
16:27 - at up one more why location okay so now
16:31 - we see what's going on here the those
16:36 - are disappearing too early ah I have
16:40 - another error I wonder if somebody cut
16:45 - up I'm going to when I jumped back the
16:49 - Frog was still moving I definitely need
16:50 - to detach okay good point good point
16:52 - so reset game in reset game this is
16:56 - pretty easy I should just say frog
17:01 - detach also so let's add that function
17:06 - or you know what I can do I don't
17:11 - actually need a new function I could
17:13 - just say attach null so that's kind of
17:16 - essentially detaching it just set the
17:18 - attach thing to know that will fix that
17:20 - problem but I have a different problem I
17:21 - lost track of where I was the in car
17:25 - right if X is less than its
17:29 - speed is less than zero it's moving this
17:31 - way and X is less than negative grid no
17:33 - no no no no no not grid this should not
17:38 - be grid this should be this should be
17:42 - width plus that should be with plus plus
17:45 - grid because that's the X but I need to
17:48 - find when the left side right the left
17:50 - side is X plus width so W if it's less
17:54 - than negative W minus grid right it
17:58 - should get all the way off there we go
18:02 - okay so I just fix that so now I should
18:06 - be able to jump here and jump there and
18:08 - jump back down and jump back up look at
18:11 - that jump back down and jump back up
18:14 - I just computer solved a jump and then I
18:16 - get reset now the question is can I jump
18:21 - on to the edge of it let's try that can
18:23 - I jump on to the edge ooh come back oh
18:24 - it's still moving why am I still moving
18:26 - oh because when I jump down I didn't
18:28 - detach okay I got you everybody so if I
18:34 - jump back to the safety zone which is if
18:38 - I'm out of this zone I should also make
18:42 - sure to detach attach null Oh convoluted
18:47 - code we could refactor this there'll be
18:49 - a whole video on refactoring someday
18:51 - okay so now I can jump up and jump back
18:53 - down and I'm not still moving what I
18:56 - wanted to show you was that oh and I
18:58 - left I can hang off the edge which I
19:00 - think is okay let's make the Frog a
19:02 - little bit transparent let's give the
19:06 - Frog a little bit of transparency just
19:09 - so we can see that better you know
19:12 - visually I encourage you to think of a
19:14 - better way to visually do this but we
19:18 - can see kind of where the Frog is okay
19:20 - so I think we're kind of done I should
19:25 - add another row I should add the buckets
19:27 - at the top what am I missing
19:28 - okay so there's one thing we need to
19:30 - deal with this problem here goes to frog
19:34 - frog my frog is gone so the Frog can
19:40 - can't ever actually leave the window if
19:43 - the log starts to leave it needs to get
19:46 - pushed off and I think there's a way
19:48 - we're going to be able to do this I'm
19:49 - going to do this just in the update
19:51 - function I'm going to say frog dot x
19:56 - equals constrain the X can never go
20:02 - farther than zero on the left side and
20:06 - it can never go farther than with minus
20:10 - the frogs width on the right side so
20:14 - let's look at this what's going to
20:16 - happen now and it gets resetting I was
20:18 - so remarkably easy there we go and the
20:23 - Frog is now going to slide and then get
20:25 - n reset so if I don't jump off in time
20:28 - so if I let's see if I can jump off in
20:30 - time now there we go it jumped off in
20:33 - time can jump up so that fixes it oh my
20:36 - goodness I think I said one more row and
20:38 - then we can kind of be done if I just
20:39 - make my Frogger thing right a little
20:42 - shorter I mean I should do the buckets
20:43 - at the top but you could probably do
20:44 - that let's add one more row row seven
20:50 - row seven is going to have two more logs
20:53 - so seven logs it's going to have two
20:58 - more logs those logs will go in the
21:00 - other direction positive direction
21:02 - really fast or really slow let's just
21:04 - make them really slow let's make them
21:07 - super wide and spread out by a lot and
21:12 - let's look and they need to be one row
21:15 - up so much hard coding here there we go
21:18 - I made this kind of easy so now yeah so
21:24 - let's let's let's reset that frog back
21:27 - to the bottom and now let's play Frogger
21:30 - to do this to distribute to do hey doop
21:34 - doop do to reduce it
21:37 - what's the Frogger music okay I got to
21:40 - get past ah shoot
21:42 - it did it okay now go in this log on
21:45 - this log on this log and then
21:50 - Oh what the river is about I should be
21:54 - allowed to get to the top so the whole
21:56 - top should be another safety zone which
21:59 - is like I'm going to add another
22:03 - rectangle at the top there
22:05 - zero zero I'm just going to have the top
22:09 - be double height that's my safety zone
22:11 - and so now I should be able to say if
22:14 - frog dot Y is less than this and and
22:22 - frog dot y so the frogs really just keep
22:24 - track of which row it is in oh boy the
22:27 - grid system the time to refactor the
22:29 - whole tile based system of this frog dot
22:32 - y is or and it's greater than a grid
22:37 - times two so this should allow me to get
22:40 - to the top now okay yay that is Roger in
22:52 - three parts in what's probably like
22:54 - about 72 hours of programming time with
22:58 - just a simple result there is a lot of
23:00 - spaghetti as a in this code I think I
23:04 - would definitely like to come back this
23:06 - won't be released as quickly as you
23:08 - might I would like to come back and do a
23:09 - refactoring of this to make it better I
23:11 - look forward to hearing all of your
23:12 - comments about refactoring so what can
23:14 - you do to up so if you're looking for
23:17 - the code for this and you're at the end
23:18 - of this video you can find a link to it
23:22 - in this video's description there will
23:23 - be both this version this processing
23:25 - Java version there will be a JavaScript
23:28 - version using the p5 GS library and I
23:31 - encourage you to add your versions to
23:33 - the readme make levels make lives make a
23:37 - timer add visual design add sound make
23:40 - the frog green I will make the frog
23:43 - green at least I will make the frog
23:45 - green I will make the frog green right
23:49 - now we really have for hunger and I
23:51 - could very easily with inheritance that
