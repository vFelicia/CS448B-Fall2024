00:00 - all right welcome to part 2 of my snakes
00:02 - and ladders challenge in this part where
00:05 - I really struggle I try to add snakes
00:08 - and ladders but strangely yeah I try to
00:10 - add snakes and ladders to the board and
00:12 - figure out a good way to organize that
00:14 - and there'll be one more third part
00:16 - after this second part too
00:17 - now what I need to do is start adding
00:20 - some snakes and ladders so let's just
00:24 - add now how should be the other I guess
00:28 - there's a how should I configure I could
00:29 - make them random let me make some manual
00:31 - ones so what I'm gonna do is manually
00:33 - override the board to make some snakes
00:36 - and ladders so what I'm going to do and
00:39 - I will put it back to ten by ten in a
00:43 - second but this is a little simpler for
00:44 - me so if I go into here in the sketch
00:47 - where I'm making the board after I'm
00:51 - done making the board what I could do is
00:54 - I could just say something like tiles
00:56 - index six dot next equals one so this
01:05 - would be in a four by four board zero
01:10 - one two three four five six
01:12 - this would be a snake that would go down
01:17 - - OH - I have one whatever but let's
01:19 - make it aa this is confusing because the
01:22 - numbers I put here are not starting with
01:24 - zero so but the array index will counted
01:28 - zero so but you get the idea
01:29 - it's in whatever the index is is going
01:31 - to point to the other one so a couple
01:33 - things one is what I think that I would
01:35 - like to do so let's do this index six
01:37 - the next is one which is actually the
01:39 - second tile what I would like to do is a
01:40 - little bit goofy as I could just I could
01:43 - also just say tiles index six dots snake
01:47 - equals true so I could give it a
01:49 - property like snake equals true but I
01:52 - could also just kind of figure this out
01:54 - right because in the tile itself when
01:56 - I'm about to draw it I could say if this
02:01 - dot next does not is does not equal to
02:06 - this dot index plus one right if it's
02:09 - not if the next tile is not the one
02:11 - right after it then it has to be a
02:13 - so what I want to do is draw I want to
02:16 - do a good thing I have that um my Center
02:20 - my C equals get this dot get Center and
02:28 - next see these are very awkward variable
02:32 - names equals oh I I don't have access to
02:37 - the global variable tiles here but I
02:40 - could pass it in so when I say show when
02:45 - I draw them all this is very weird what
02:48 - I'm doing here I probably would want to
02:50 - refactor this later do it some different
02:52 - way I'm gonna pass tiles of the global
02:53 - variable so I could get access to it
02:55 - that way but I like the idea of passing
02:56 - it in just to sort of for sanity's sake
02:59 - I could say tiles this next dot get
03:04 - Center and then I could draw a line
03:07 - let's say stroke wait for stroke 255
03:15 - line from where my C 0 my C 1 next C why
03:24 - am i making these weird blames my Center
03:28 - next Center my Center 0 my Center 1 next
03:35 - Center 0 next Center 1 okay there look
03:44 - there's my snake now here's the thing is
03:48 - it actually working is it actually
03:50 - causing it to go down there if it ever
03:52 - lands on there I think it is because
03:54 - it's always going to where the next
03:55 - thing is and I don't really like I want
03:57 - to make a more interesting looking snake
03:59 - so let's pick a different tile like 9
04:05 - how about 10
04:06 - so it's a loose diagonal there we go
04:08 - okay so now let's slow this down a
04:11 - little bit frame rate 10 boy very hard
04:20 - for me to see if this is working right
04:21 - is it actually going to the next spot oh
04:25 - I don't think I actually
04:27 - holder's go to the next pot I would just
04:28 - tell two plus plus so let's take a look
04:31 - at that when the player moves
04:35 - oh it just moves the spot up but it
04:37 - can't do that anymore it can't do that
04:39 - anymore it has to examine its spot Oh
04:43 - weird so what it really should do is so
04:47 - we've to have the tiles here oh this is
04:49 - getting very awkward this is a very
04:52 - awkward game I'm making it's gonna have
04:54 - the tiles here and what it's going to do
04:57 - is in the player object it's going to
05:02 - take its spot and move up by this number
05:07 - and then it's going to say oh yeah this
05:13 - is why it would be nice for it to
05:14 - actually have a boolean variable as to
05:16 - whether because it's it's the act of
05:18 - landing on it so I need to check
05:20 - something when I land on it whether it
05:21 - should move to the next thing so you
05:23 - know what here's what I'm gonna do this
05:25 - in a different way I got an idea I've
05:28 - got an idea what I'm gonna do is I'm
05:31 - gonna make each tile next is kind of
05:36 - unnecessary I don't know I'm not sure
05:37 - exactly why I have that in there anymore
05:39 - but I'm gonna say this dots snake equals
05:43 - zero and this dot ladder equals zero so
05:47 - they all have a snake and ladder of zero
05:50 - zero means well no it could be this in
05:54 - this case there can never be a snake
05:56 - that takes you all the way back to the
05:57 - first spot so I'll have a snake and
05:59 - ladder of negative one all right
06:01 - negative one means no snake no ladder I
06:03 - could say false or something but anyway
06:05 - I'm gonna do that then in the sketch I'm
06:10 - not gonna override the next I'm just
06:12 - gonna say it's snake is one so now when
06:16 - I am when I am rendering the tile
06:23 - instead of checking the next thing which
06:26 - is kind of nuts I'm going to say if this
06:28 - dot snake is greater than zero I'm gonna
06:31 - draw that like ah but the next oh yeah
06:34 - and then I just go to the I draw the
06:36 - line from it to this dot snake it's
06:39 - greater than negative one
06:40 - or and maybe the well I'm gonna do these
06:45 - total is this silly I'm gonna do these
06:46 - as two separate if statements if this
06:49 - dot latter is greater than one and I
06:53 - could obviously condense these into one
06:55 - statement which I will eventually at
06:56 - some point in my life if this that
06:58 - latter is greater than one boo-yeah I'm
07:03 - still doing this project what I was it's
07:04 - like five o'clock ass this dot Ladder is
07:07 - greater than one then
07:11 - the ladders will be black alright so now
07:16 - let's take a look at this so I've still
07:19 - got the snake in there now what happens
07:21 - when the player rolls if the tile is
07:28 - tiles index this dot spot if this dot
07:34 - spot snake oh you know what I could do I
07:38 - could have this snake be a negative
07:40 - number and the zero means there's
07:43 - nothing this would be better let's do it
07:47 - a different way I got a better idea
07:48 - so by definition what should we call it
07:51 - snake ladder it's a snake either a snake
07:52 - or a ladder the tile spot the spot is
07:55 - right is it a snake snake or ladder
07:58 - they're all equal to zero
08:00 - it's a snake or ladder if it's equal to
08:02 - zero and when I create it I'm gonna say
08:10 - the snake or ladder is like negative
08:14 - five meaning go back five spots this is
08:17 - so much better so much better even
08:19 - though my variable names snicker it's
08:20 - got a terrible so now what I can do is
08:23 - in the tile hmm when I'm drawing it if
08:28 - snake or ladder is not equal to zero
08:34 - right then I've got to draw a line from
08:38 - this index plus okay so thus this snake
08:46 - for ladder that's it's the difference
08:49 - between where I am where I'm currently
08:50 - going to go back to and then I draw that
08:52 - line
08:54 - and then I don't need this whole second
08:56 - nonsense thing and then of course in the
08:59 - player if it lands if this snake or
09:02 - ladder does not equal is not zero then
09:07 - this dot spot plus equals that goes back
09:11 - to wherever it goes
09:12 - dare I say I have this now all right
09:16 - cannot read property get center of
09:18 - undefined player dodged ass line twenty
09:21 - three current get center tiles this dot
09:25 - spot yet you know I'm getting a great
09:28 - comment in the chat from Dennis who
09:31 - writes I don't need this I don't need
09:37 - this if statement because if it's zero
09:40 - it's just not gonna change oh this is
09:43 - probably the problem I must have messed
09:47 - this up somehow so this plus equals
09:51 - snake or letter let's look at console
09:53 - dot log this dot spot this seems like
09:56 - it's the problem console dot log this
09:58 - snake or ladder it's probably my
10:00 - variable name it's the problem undefined
10:03 - so why is this undefined oh because it's
10:06 - not this it is the tile it is the tiles
10:10 - maker ladder of course the player is at
10:12 - a spot the tile is telling it where to
10:14 - go and by the way people were telling me
10:16 - this in the chat so I think I'm gonna
10:19 - try to feel confident that that's gonna
10:21 - fix it now and now get Center player
10:26 - twenty undefined no problem no problem o
10:29 - tile I didn't actually fix it weirdly
10:31 - enough okay let's try this again alright
10:36 - so oh you I see because the reason why I
10:39 - need a move is because I want to draw it
10:42 - there and then I want to draw it the
10:44 - next like I want to see it land there
10:46 - and see it go down like animation wise I
10:48 - kind of want to see it land there and go
10:49 - down okay
10:50 - first of all why did this happen player
10:51 - das line ten so if I got if I'm off the
10:56 - board here so what I what I do need to
10:59 - say is I do need this though if tile
11:02 - exists so as long as there is a tile
11:04 - there that'll fix that
11:07 - I could I kind of would like to at some
11:11 - point do something where it lands there
11:12 - and then animates going to the next step
11:14 - but I'm gonna like skip worrying about
11:17 - that right now I'm just going to this is
11:21 - working right you can see that it's
11:23 - taking me an average of about 12 now
11:25 - with this one little blip now what I can
11:27 - do so first of all I want those ladders
11:29 - to be a different color so what I'm
11:32 - gonna do here in the tile is if that
11:39 - this is going to be stroke or if this
11:42 - would actually work
11:43 - 255 I well I can do one of those what
11:46 - are those things call those fancy little
11:47 - if statements you do in one space here
11:50 - what is called again somebody tell me
11:52 - what's that what could I never remember
11:55 - that I don't use them I'm just gonna say
11:57 - I'm gonna do my own nice little way of
11:59 - doing this in a really ridiculous way if
12:02 - this maker ladder is less than zero then
12:05 - it's going to be that is a snake
12:07 - otherwise it is a ladder okay so let's
12:11 - look at this now what I'm going to do is
12:13 - I'm going to configure in this main
12:16 - sketch a couple more of these oh let's
12:20 - make it let's make it let's make it 10
12:23 - by 10 where do I do that again I change
12:27 - the resolution to 40 and now I've got a
12:31 - lot of stuff to work with I've got a
12:32 - hundred tiles so what I'm gonna do
12:35 - actually I'm gonna just pick make some
12:36 - randomly because I kind of wanna I don't
12:38 - want to figure it out so I'm gonna just
12:39 - may say let a equal 0 is less than 5 I'm
12:43 - gonna have five snakes and five ladders
12:49 - and I could so I'm gonna pick I'm gonna
12:56 - pick a random tile and I'm gonna say
12:59 - tile dot snakes or letter equals a
13:04 - random negative number between negative
13:07 - 10 and negative negative 1 this is tear
13:11 - down I could have a serious problem here
13:13 - but I'm not gonna worry about it just
13:14 - yet then
13:16 - I'm gonna do this between 1 and tendon
13:22 - actually it doesn't make sense for his
13:23 - ladder to go horizontally it's got to go
13:25 - on to a different row if I'm picking
13:28 - them randomly it doesn't make sense for
13:30 - any of the snakes to be in the first row
13:33 - and any of the ladders to be in the last
13:34 - row all right so I should probably
13:36 - account for that so I can't just pick a
13:40 - random tile like I want to do this well
13:43 - but I also want to do it quickly and not
13:45 - worry about it
13:46 - but let's let's be thoughtful about this
13:48 - so random I guess I have to pick an
13:51 - index so I want to pick there's a
13:54 - certain number of qov there's a certain
13:57 - number of columns so I can say I want to
14:01 - pick a random where am i doing that I
14:03 - want to pick a random index between for
14:09 - a snake it can't be in the bottom so it
14:12 - has to be the first one would be columns
14:15 - two tiles dot length so that's a random
14:19 - index and then that in debt that would
14:24 - get a random amount whoops what is that
14:27 - that would get a random negative number
14:30 - and it should be them by minimum it has
14:34 - to be the number right it's got to go be
14:36 - at least the number of kala good you
14:42 - know if it's kind of earlier in the
14:43 - thing it could point down I don't know I
14:46 - just make it in between columns and oh
14:51 - and then all the way back to oh the
14:54 - difference between what's the Mac okay
14:55 - let's figure this out this is worth
14:57 - doing nuts okay let's say I pick this
15:03 - here the only valid places that I would
15:07 - have a snake going to this would be the
15:09 - first one and this would be the last one
15:13 - so the range is between its index - well
15:24 - it depends on which torretta its index -
15:27 - oh there's got to be some nice man
15:29 - for this this is four by four the number
15:33 - of columns modulus - yeah yeah that's
15:36 - always going to be the case
15:37 - the number of columns not the number
15:41 - column that it's indexed module sorry
15:43 - sorry it's Index - its index modulus the
15:49 - number of columns so that's gonna get me
15:51 - at a minimum here and then the bottom is
15:55 - just you know I don't want anything to
15:57 - be able to go past so so that's where it
16:02 - can be oh oh so they I don't know I I
16:04 - don't need so I could just pick the
16:08 - range between index modulus columns
16:12 - that's - - that's the smallest amount
16:16 - and but not the smallest it's a bit
16:19 - largest amount in the case of negative
16:20 - numbers and then - all the way to the
16:23 - bottom would be itself
16:29 - itself - one itself - one index minus
16:32 - one so this should work but this is that
16:35 - okay I think there's a word for taking
16:38 - random ones so this is going to be a
16:41 - random number between what did I say it
16:45 - was between it's negative its index plus
16:52 - one I'm actually gonna just you know
16:54 - what I'm going to do this is so silly
16:56 - I'll just make this negative one this is
16:59 - gonna allow me to understand the range
17:00 - much more easily index modulus columns
17:04 - and then index minus one so that is that
17:10 - is for a snake and I don't feel like
17:14 - doing two of these so I'm just going to
17:16 - say I'm gonna I'm gonna do 10 and if I
17:23 - modulus 2 equals 0 then D I owe this is
17:29 - a I'm gonna I'm gonna say I'm gonna say
17:32 - let Direction equal 1 otherwise
17:34 - Direction equals negative 1 because the
17:36 - numbers should work out the same way in
17:37 - terms of going to the top no they don't
17:41 - work they don't
17:42 - work the same way in terms of going to
17:43 - the top because if I need to go to the
17:46 - top I've got to subtract the length not
17:48 - zero so there's a lot more options to go
17:50 - to the top designed the board I should
17:55 - just say I was gonna hard-code the
17:57 - numbers all right let's do this let's do
17:59 - this so this is going to be the rate
18:03 - let's just do some snakes let's just see
18:06 - if we get some snakes
18:07 - okay index is not defined sketch J s
18:09 - line forty oh what am I doing here I
18:13 - have to pick a random index whoa
18:19 - I lost completely lost where I was first
18:22 - I'm picking a random tile so first I
18:26 - want to pick a tile index which is a I
18:31 - had that in here already which is from
18:34 - the second row columns all the way to
18:37 - the end a random number or it's good
18:48 - okay it's gonna be okay everybody that's
18:50 - the index and then where I've got oh boy
18:56 - and that oh wait there are two lines of
18:58 - code there that's what's going on here
19:00 - and then oh my goodness this that
19:07 - particular tile is this random thing why
19:13 - why why is it Auto formatting this up
19:16 - here what have I done wrong random there
19:21 - we go okay so this is the index right
19:24 - I'm picking some random tile by the way
19:26 - I could pick the same tile twice which
19:29 - is a real problem I've got it I've got
19:30 - to deal with that this was a terrible
19:32 - idea
19:32 - oh my goodness a terrible idea then it's
19:35 - snakes or ladder number is some random
19:38 - amount a little bit back all the way to
19:40 - the bottom okay let's see this
19:42 - unexpected token line 43 because I have
19:46 - extra extra brackets okay all right I
19:50 - don't see doesn't look like it picked
19:53 - Danny
19:55 - okay well but it is or am I just not
19:59 - seeing them
20:00 - oh it's is it going down and wait so
20:02 - hold on so let's take a look at console
20:07 - dot log tiles index snakes or a ladder I
20:15 - should have thought about this okay so
20:20 - we got this one oh there's like I put in
20:23 - multiple variables sometimes I say snake
20:25 - or ladder is sometimes I say snakes or
20:27 - letters that is really bad okay so a
20:33 - snake or ladder I think that's what I
20:35 - meant to do I think that's the brothels
20:39 - there we go look look we've got two
20:42 - there there are three snakes one goes
20:45 - from here to there one goes from here to
20:47 - there and one goes from there to here
20:48 - right so we're having trouble getting to
20:51 - the top does it keeps wow it's really
20:54 - good at landing on that one oh it made
20:56 - it past it oh boy
20:58 - well this is exciting though it's
21:00 - actually kind of working all right so my
21:03 - design is horrific first of all one
21:06 - thing I really need to do is when I draw
21:08 - the tiles I need to say when I draw the
21:12 - rectangle I need to say no stroke those
21:16 - I don't make this is much more clear
21:18 - okay so a couple things I should do I'm
21:19 - not gonna
21:20 - I really should make it so I can't pick
21:21 - the same one twice but since I only made
21:23 - three that's not that big of a deal this
21:25 - is actually working
21:26 - Frank amazingly now I'm gonna go back to
21:29 - the sketch and let me pick three ladders
21:33 - so the ladders would be anywhere from
21:37 - right the ladders would be anywhere from
21:40 - the very top oh oh interesting no
21:47 - there's no ladder on the top anywhere
21:49 - from the second row all the way to the
21:51 - bottom so I need to pick an index that
21:54 - goes all the way from 0 to the length
21:57 - minus columns and then I'm going to go
22:01 - up a certain amount so if I were here
22:06 - I'm going to take
22:09 - this you know it's actually columns -
22:16 - index modulus columns oh no that's fine
22:21 - that's fine
22:22 - because yeah because I I want to know
22:24 - how many up to there so to always go to
22:26 - another row I'll take that instead I'll
22:29 - go up by this much and then the limit is
22:32 - I can only go up by you know - laughs
22:34 - maybe they the second-to-last spot okay
22:37 - so now I'm going to make some random
22:40 - ones where I'm going to pick a random
22:42 - index so I've got to go from the zero I
22:47 - did that already
22:48 - and then I could go up by columns
22:52 - - index mod columns and then all the way
22:57 - up to tiles lengths - where I am - one I
23:05 - think that makes sense all right so
23:07 - let's see now if I can get a bunch of
23:09 - ladders there there's a bunch of layers
23:10 - now interestingly enough because of the
23:12 - order I've drawing stuff the ladders get
23:14 - covered over so I should definitely fix
23:17 - that let's see here
23:20 - I've got it I should probably do a pass
23:23 - the tile let me do let me do let me do a
23:31 - this show function it will be by itself
23:34 - and then I'll do show snakes ladders and
23:38 - I'll do all this stuff in there so that
23:41 - I can do that afterwards oh okay
23:44 - so in the so I can do that as a separate
23:46 - loop and so here when I'm when I where
23:50 - am i showing all the tiles here can do
23:53 - this and then I can do tiles that show
23:56 - snakes ladders there we go now here's
24:03 - the thing the question is is this
24:06 - actually I don't can't tell if the
24:08 - ladders are working can anyone see if
24:10 - the ladders are working
24:15 - is it skipping stuff if it lands on a
24:17 - ladder yeah it did it just went up
24:20 - didn't it just go up there I'm pretty
24:22 - sure it did I'm pretty sure it did yeah
24:25 - and this is pretty bad where I'm you can
24:28 - get flee get some very unlucky things so
24:30 - interestingly enough right let's just
24:32 - for the sake of argument very quickly
24:34 - I'm gonna I'm gonna run fast again so
24:36 - I'm gonna go back to the sketch if you
24:38 - were really done here I'm gonna take out
24:39 - this slower framerate I'm gonna take out
24:42 - adding any snakes and ladders and I'm
24:45 - gonna run this really fast so the
24:49 - average should be and I by the way I
24:51 - should be allowed to roll us let's let's
24:52 - make it a six-sided die I don't know
24:54 - what what it actually is but let's look
24:56 - in the role let's say you can roll a 1
24:59 - through 6 which actually would be a 1
25:02 - through 7 if I'm flooring it I guess I
25:05 - could round it I could do 0 through 6
25:07 - and round it with a X to work no no
25:09 - because then I could get a 0 anyway so
25:11 - let's do this so that it can roll a bit
25:13 - more so we could see the average amount
25:16 - is around 30 does that make sense
25:20 - it's a hundred yeah I I'm gonna have to
25:23 - just assume that makes sense that an
25:25 - average it's gonna take about 30 rolls
25:28 - and it seemed to be doing a little bit
25:29 - better right now so now let's add in
25:31 - those snakes and ladders oh I look
25:36 - forward to all the much better versions
25:37 - you all make of this and there we go
25:40 - this looks terrible
25:42 - well those ladders are really helping
25:44 - out alright so that wraps up the second
25:46 - part there there's one more part you can
25:48 - check this video's description for a
25:49 - link to this last part so you might have
25:51 - noticed it's really hard to tell is this
25:52 - thing even working like what's going on
25:54 - so in the next part I try to think about
25:56 - the state of the game what's happening
25:58 - and what do I want to draw to indicate
26:00 - what's happened to give me a little bit
26:01 - of more of a debug view ultimately in
26:03 - the end you want to really animate for
26:05 - the user to understand and enjoy the
26:06 - game but I'm really just right now
26:08 - trying to get it to make sense for me so
26:10 - that's good what's gonna happen in the
26:11 - third part
26:15 - [Music]
26:20 - you
