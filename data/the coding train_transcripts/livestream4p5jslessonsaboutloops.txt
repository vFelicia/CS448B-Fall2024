00:07 - okay test volume let's see
00:12 - test test test volume test volume I
00:17 - think it's working okay I think I just
00:20 - read me and oops I got to turn the sound
00:25 - off here so I doubt there's anybody here
00:29 - but this will get recorded I'm gonna
00:32 - make some video lessons about loops and
00:34 - to start that off I'm opening up p5 I am
00:42 - creating a new
00:49 - your project and I'm saying okay sorry I
01:02 - gotta set up something that will need a
01:06 - loop for
01:20 - let's do this
01:23 - and maybe 50 100 150 200 250
01:38 - oops 200 250 250 so what I'm doing here
01:44 - is I save this as under Luke's Luke's
01:52 - one what I'm doing here is setting up
01:57 - example ah you can't see me this whole
02:00 - time I should just start this over shoot
02:05 - anybody there to watching now sorry
02:09 - everybody
02:13 - okay
02:19 - okay so okay now back to the video I'm
02:25 - making
02:33 - okay
02:35 - so here is the scenario so this is a
02:38 - scenario I'm going to start with in the
02:40 - video which is the many many many many
02:42 - many many shapes how do you have this
02:44 - same line of code but repeat it multiple
02:48 - times with a loop that's the video I'm
02:51 - going to make I gotta turn the air
02:52 - conditioning down
02:54 - I have oops not very much time it's
02:57 - 10:30
02:58 - I'm gonna try to do a couple videos
03:00 - about loops in the next 30 to 40 minutes
03:03 - before I have to go and then I have
03:05 - class and I have my invisible cup again
03:07 - which I'm gonna drink my invisible water
03:08 - I doubt anyone's ever gonna watch this
03:16 - which is fine just fine by me
03:18 - and I'm gonna get started this video I'm
03:20 - gonna check the chat see if anybody's
03:21 - there has any questions or comments hi
03:23 - is that is the audio okay can you hear
03:26 - okay and then I'm also gonna do another
03:27 - test is that audio okay can you hear
03:30 - okay from this camera can you hear okay
03:33 - from this camera so I have to wait for
03:37 - any response now that I'm in my infinite
03:41 - thing
03:46 - all right I'm just gonna assume that the
03:49 - audio is working fine it always has been
03:51 - okay okay so now I need to get ready I'm
03:56 - gonna start over here and I'm gonna this
04:01 - video is gonna be about I'm going to
04:03 - make a video about the while loop and
04:05 - the for loop all in one it's gonna be a
04:07 - little more condensed than the videos I
04:09 - made last year about processing that are
04:11 - so more long-winded with lots more stuff
04:12 - okay here we go I don't know what the
04:20 - first thing to say is okay and also like
04:24 - my nose is running and you define happen
04:27 - tissue I'll be fine okay so this video
04:31 - that I'm making right now I'm going to
04:34 - look at something in programming a
04:36 - control structure a way to control the
04:38 - flow of how program runs what it does is
04:40 - called a repeat loop and this if you've
04:42 - just started programming if you've
04:44 - watched some of the other videos or
04:45 - played around with some code this is
04:46 - clearly something that you've
04:48 - encountered a need for and I have a
04:50 - prime example of that right here so you
04:53 - can see this sketch and it has 1 2 3 4 5
04:57 - 6 lines of code each line of code draws
04:59 - a line so there's six lines on the
05:02 - screen it's not too unreasonable I have
05:03 - six lines of code six lines in the
05:05 - canvas it works but I wanted to add some
05:09 - more lines or I I want to you know what
05:12 - mmm I think I want to do this with the
05:14 - circles stop I think I'm gonna do this
05:19 - with ellipses
05:25 - because I'm saying lines of code and
05:27 - lines is the shape and it's proving to
05:30 - be a bit awkward so this should work now
05:33 - I just need to have them be like 25 by
05:38 - 25 and maybe I'll put them all at 200
05:49 - sorry but so I just copy 20 this also
05:53 - looks a bit more neat I can even do that
05:57 - oops I'm just being crazy now and I keep
06:04 - I'll keep the zero on there I think
06:06 - that's worth it okay um great I'm just
06:10 - gonna check the chat to see if anyone
06:12 - said anything hi Joan or maybe I pretty
06:17 - this pronounce the name okay I'm back
06:22 - okay so let me start this video over
06:24 - again a little water okay pen here we go
06:38 - hello so this I think I'm stop saying
06:42 - hello this video I would like to talk
06:46 - about something called a repeat loop
06:47 - this is a essential control structure in
06:50 - programming that you need to do all
06:52 - sorts of things if you've been working
06:53 - with code and drawing it's probably
06:56 - become a recently immediately clear what
06:58 - you might need a repeat loop for and I
07:00 - have a demonstration of that right here
07:02 - so if you see this canvas here there are
07:05 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 circles there each circle is
07:08 - drawn with a single call to the ellipse
07:10 - function and this works fine you want 6
07:13 - circles on the screen call the ellipse
07:15 - function 6 times but if you want to have
07:18 - 60 circles on the screen or 600 circles
07:21 - on the screen or spaced them closer or
07:23 - do more stuff with them having an
07:26 - individual line of code for the same
07:28 - thing that's repeated over and over
07:30 - again is certainly not the route that
07:33 - you want to go so this is exactly what a
07:35 - repeat loop is for and I said that a
07:37 - repeat loop is a control structure and
07:39 - in a previous video I looked at another
07:41 - control structure known as a conditional
07:44 - statement so that control structure
07:46 - looked like this if boolean expression
07:51 - open curly bracket close curly bracket
07:55 - and if this is true this code is
07:58 - executed I'm going to add something once
08:00 - and then we go to the next line of code
08:02 - this is how this particular control
08:05 - structure worked the if the conditional
08:07 - statement control structure so the
08:10 - control structure of a loop is written
08:14 - just like the if statement but with a
08:16 - different keyword besides if and now
08:18 - there's actually two ways of doing it
08:19 - the first way that I'm going to show you
08:21 - looks very much like the if statement
08:24 - its while boolean expression while this
08:30 - is true continue to do this code over
08:33 - and over and over and over
08:35 - over again so I want to think about this
08:38 - control structure and I'm gonna add some
08:40 - things to the code and we're gonna add
08:42 - this control structure then into the
08:44 - code so these are really identical in
08:47 - their syntax and form the differences
08:49 - are if here while here if this is true
08:53 - do this while this is true continue to
08:56 - execute this code over and over again
08:57 - which opens up a little bit of a
08:59 - dangerous fact it's possible your
09:02 - program could get stuck inside this loop
09:04 - and this is something we're going to
09:05 - have to deal with immediately right now
09:07 - as we start to work on this problem
09:08 - so come on over here so let's look at
09:11 - this code again so one thing you'll
09:13 - notice about this code is I didn't use
09:14 - any variables so I think it would be
09:16 - advantageous to use a variable and what
09:19 - I'm going to do is I'm going to start a
09:20 - variable and I'm gonna call it X x
09:24 - equals 0 now I declared it up on the top
09:27 - am I in the previous videos that I made
09:30 - in all the examples the variables have
09:31 - always been declared at the top this is
09:33 - because there it's it's the I've been
09:36 - using these variables as so-called
09:38 - global variables meaning I could just
09:40 - use them anywhere in my code and the
09:42 - program remembers them over and over
09:44 - again forever and ever here is a case
09:46 - right now where actually what I want to
09:48 - do is just use a variable just for this
09:51 - section of the code and I don't need to
09:53 - remember it any other time when mouse is
09:55 - pressed or back and set up or anything
09:57 - like that so actually I'm going to take
09:58 - this opportunity to show you something
10:01 - called a local variable and if you
10:03 - declare a variable inside of a function
10:06 - I'm inside this draw function this
10:09 - variable right now is a local variable
10:11 - it's only available for the purposes of
10:15 - this draw function okay so now what do I
10:19 - want to do I want to put X here and I
10:22 - could say X plus 50 X plus 100 I could
10:25 - keep doing that and we'd have the same
10:26 - program I just used X instead of 0 but
10:29 - what I actually want to do is show you
10:31 - what if I just have X everywhere if I
10:36 - have X X in all of these lines of code
10:39 - now what do I have I have one circle at
10:43 - 0 because I drew the asain ellipse at 0
10:45 - 0 0 0
10:46 - so what if I were to now add after each
10:50 - one x equals x plus 50 so let's move X
10:53 - by 50 after each ellipse and I'm also
10:57 - gonna do something I'm gonna add some
10:58 - line breaks whoops wrong place I'm gonna
11:02 - add some line breaks if I can manage
11:04 - this just to sort of look at it to see
11:08 - what is repeated okay so and let's add a
11:12 - line break here okay okay so let's look
11:15 - at this now I have these chunks ellipse
11:18 - then add 50 ellipse then add 50 ellipse
11:21 - then add 50 ellipse venality all of
11:23 - these blocks of code are actually
11:25 - identical right like let me let me
11:29 - delete them and just show you what I
11:30 - mean right so now we run this program
11:34 - one ellipse now let me take these two
11:37 - lines of code and just do paste paste
11:39 - paste paste paste paste paste paste
11:42 - paste auto format now I have all these
11:46 - ellipse there so this now now now we
11:49 - really have the same exact lines of code
11:52 - X like just over and over and over again
11:55 - there's gotta be a way to perform those
12:00 - lines of code over and over again I just
12:02 - want to say ellipse at X etc and then I
12:06 - want to say x equals x plus 50 this is
12:09 - exactly what I want to do I just want to
12:10 - do this over and over again while
12:12 - something is true okay so let's think
12:15 - about that we need to figure out when do
12:18 - I stop doing this over and over again if
12:20 - I just wrote true inside here this would
12:22 - loop would execute forever and the
12:24 - program would never would never stop and
12:27 - get stuck there we'd never see anything
12:29 - on the screen what is my exit condition
12:31 - well there is no answer to this question
12:33 - it's kind of up to you and what am i why
12:35 - am I even here drawing circles on the
12:37 - screen I'll never know but presumably
12:40 - you have a reason for learning
12:41 - programming and you have an idea for
12:42 - something you want to make in this case
12:44 - no I can make up something I want to
12:45 - let's say on that I just want to keep
12:47 - drawing circles till I get to the edge
12:48 - of the window so what is my exit
12:51 - condition hi my exit condition is this
12:54 - is the canvas the exit condition I want
12:58 - to stop looping
12:59 - when X is greater than with right this
13:03 - is what I want to stop looping but
13:07 - remember the thing that in here is when
13:09 - it's true that's not when I stop looping
13:12 - that's when I continue looping so I want
13:14 - to continue looping as long as X is less
13:18 - than width so as long as X is less than
13:21 - width
13:22 - I want to draw this ellipse over and
13:25 - over and over again okay so let's come
13:28 - over here and see that so now I can take
13:32 - all this nonsense and just leave this
13:35 - important part these are the two lines
13:38 - of code do that I want to repeat over
13:40 - and over and over again while X is still
13:43 - on the screen do this draw a circle move
13:45 - over draw a circle move over draw a
13:46 - circle move over so now I can add while
13:49 - X is less than width and then I need a
13:54 - close curly bracket and again this is a
13:57 - new block of code this while loop is a
13:59 - new block of code it opens with a curly
14:01 - bracket it ends with a curly bracket and
14:03 - the convention is to indent the inside
14:05 - just visually for a human being to be
14:06 - able to see it so now I'm going to run
14:09 - this we can see there all the ellipses
14:12 - now if you look at this you can see it
14:14 - kind of the first one starts a deer on
14:16 - the last one doesn't start it with
14:17 - that's simply because I have X is less
14:19 - than width we could I don't know if
14:20 - width is divisible by 50 I think it is I
14:22 - could try less than equals and then I
14:24 - kind of get that last one so the math
14:26 - here matters like where's your exactly
14:28 - your exit condition and that sort of
14:30 - thing but now you can see I've drawn all
14:32 - these circles so this is a good nice
14:36 - start however somebody watching this
14:42 - video somebody out there in the world
14:44 - who may be watching this video is gonna
14:45 - say why are you bothering with this
14:46 - while loop thing nobody ever uses a
14:48 - while loop well I personally felt like
14:51 - it was worth five minutes of our time
14:52 - your time my time to look at the while
14:55 - loop because it translates so nicely
14:58 - from this if statement to why so what
15:01 - happened here if this is true do this
15:03 - once whilst you do this over and over
15:05 - again but if you'll notice this
15:08 - particular while loop has
15:10 - three elements to it that I want to note
15:12 - to you the first one is we start with
15:15 - initializing a variable bar X equals 0
15:17 - the second thing is we test for an exit
15:20 - condition X is less than or equal to
15:23 - width and the third thing I want to note
15:25 - is that we have this incrementation
15:26 - operation X goes up by 50 so those three
15:31 - elements are so common in loops that
15:35 - there's an entire other looping
15:37 - structure control structure called a for
15:39 - loop that puts all those things together
15:41 - as just 1 2 3 so I want to redo this
15:45 - exact same program with a for loop and
15:47 - show you what what I mean so we had so
15:51 - let me erase all this so take me a
15:54 - second think to yourself about something
15:57 - so I had 3 things I had an
16:00 - initialization bar x equals 0 I have a
16:03 - boolean test is X less than with and
16:08 - then at the end of the loop I had an
16:11 - increment ation option operation x
16:13 - equals x plus 50 so what I'm suggesting
16:16 - to you is this is such a common kind of
16:19 - loop that the loop you will most likely
16:21 - use in almost all of your programs and I
16:23 - would suggest you doing an exercise with
16:24 - is a for loop for VAR x equals 0 X is
16:33 - less than with X I'm going to go off of
16:37 - the screen equals x plus 50 can you
16:40 - still see that print these curly
16:42 - brackets okay so this is taking
16:47 - everything from this while loop and
16:49 - condensing it so the loop starts by
16:51 - initializing X every time through the
16:54 - loop X goes up by 50 and every time the
16:56 - loop finishes it checks if the exit
17:00 - condition has been met in which case it
17:02 - then exits the loop so we can now go
17:06 - back to this program and I'm going to
17:09 - what I'm actually going to do is I'm
17:10 - going to leave this I'm going to put
17:11 - this at all the circles at x equals 100
17:15 - and I'm gonna rewrite this same loop
17:19 - down here with a for loop so I don't
17:22 - need to
17:22 - actually I'm gonna say for VAR x equals
17:25 - 0 X is less than with x equals x plus 50
17:32 - curly bracket and let me widen the
17:36 - editor here so you can see the whole
17:37 - thing and then all I need is the one
17:40 - line of code the thing that I want to
17:42 - happen during this counting increment is
17:44 - counting looping operation which is that
17:46 - I want to draw the ellipses and I'm
17:48 - gonna draw them at 300 so let's make
17:50 - these some color and let's make these
17:56 - some other color and let's run it so we
18:03 - can see oh and I I guess I'll do the X
18:05 - less than or equals for both of them and
18:07 - you can see now so you can see both
18:09 - loops perform exactly the same task this
18:12 - is a bit more explicit because you can
18:14 - kind of read the order more obviously
18:15 - start with x equals 0
18:17 - while it's less than with draw this
18:19 - circle and go up by 50 but the exact
18:21 - same thing is happening here and it's so
18:22 - common that being able to condense this
18:24 - into one line of code is something that
18:26 - you might do now inevitably you're going
18:28 - to see other examples around the
18:30 - internet and one thing that I think I
18:32 - should point out is this kind of
18:33 - copyright operation x equals x plus 50
18:36 - is also so common that programmers have
18:39 - developed a shorthand for it which i
18:41 - think is worth noting right now okay so
18:45 - there is it's often you might see a line
18:48 - of code like this x equals x plus 50
18:51 - this line of code can be written as
18:54 - shorthand as X plus equals 50 okay so
19:00 - that's one thing to notice you might see
19:02 - this in examples that you look at this
19:04 - is certainly more explicit and more
19:05 - long-winded but this is just as accurate
19:07 - as the exact same operation the other
19:09 - thing you might see is when you have the
19:11 - number 1 x equals x plus 1 this is
19:14 - written shorthand as X plus plus if you
19:18 - ever thought about it there's a
19:19 - programming language called C and
19:21 - there's a programming language called
19:22 - C++ which is like the next version of C
19:25 - but close enough but so this is also
19:28 - such a convention that it sort of made
19:29 - our way into kind of vernacular speak
19:32 - whose vernacular
19:33 - I don't know what vernacular means I
19:35 - really should've stopped this video a
19:36 - while ago so this is just a little
19:38 - tidbit you might see that if I were to
19:40 - add that to this example I would say I
19:43 - would change this to x plus equals 50
19:46 - and then I would run it again and we
19:48 - have still the same exact result so what
19:51 - I would say to you is try to think try
19:54 - lines try rectangles try to control your
19:57 - loops what if you have things moving
19:58 - down or diagonally or what if you could
20:00 - you change the color like how would you
20:02 - have each one of these shapes be a
20:04 - different color from Bright to dark from
20:06 - dark to bright the map function that I
20:08 - looked at in a previous video could be
20:10 - relevant so try using a repeat loop to
20:12 - create some pattern of repeating shapes
20:14 - and the two other videos I would like to
20:17 - make one is I would like to look at a
20:18 - nested loop to a loop within a loop to
20:20 - draw a grid pattern and also I think I
20:23 - want to talk about an array which is a
20:24 - list of variables which goes
20:26 - hand-in-hand with a loop so I need to
20:28 - make that video at some point - thanks
20:30 - and this is the end of this one okay so
20:36 - I'm still live streaming that seemed to
20:38 - be okay you can use command click for
20:43 - multiple cursor huh I don't know what
20:48 - that means
20:49 - but thank you for the comment and hello
20:52 - to the few of you who are out here
20:55 - watching I am going I think what I will
21:00 - do is I think what I will do is let's
21:06 - see if I can do that nested loop one
21:07 - right why not right no big deal let's do
21:10 - the nested loop example video oh the
21:17 - other yeah okay so the other thing I
21:19 - want to mention the other thing I need
21:21 - to mention in a video is to talk about
21:24 - how the loop is within this draw loop I
21:32 - should have mentioned that in the
21:34 - previous video but I think I'll just do
21:37 - it both in the next one I'll do talk
21:40 - about the looping within the draw loop
21:42 - and also look at a nested
21:43 - okay so I'm gonna do that I'm gonna turn
21:45 - the air conditioning up for a minute to
21:48 - make it a little bit cooler in here
21:50 - while I'm getting ready
21:54 - so let me I'm gonna close this hello to
21:58 - some new people who have joined I'm
22:00 - recording oops I'm over here I'm
22:02 - recording videos I haven't so I'm also
22:05 - just like talking in between the
22:06 - recording a video so there'll be these
22:07 - finished videos that will get uploaded
22:09 - and then there's this long raw footage
22:11 - of me acting like a lunatic in here so
22:16 - what I want to do is remove this
22:18 - let me save as loops - I'm gonna remove
22:25 - this while loop I have like 10 more
22:27 - minutes before I should move on and I
22:29 - have to get ready for actual class so so
22:35 - here's what I want to talk about in the
22:36 - next video I want to change this to be a
22:39 - grid of circles across the across the
22:43 - whole window and then I want to talk
22:46 - about the loop within a loop which I can
22:49 - maybe do by changing the color randomly
22:51 - and it'll like flicker or something yeah
22:54 - this could be better but it's just gonna
22:56 - be what it is it's fine okay okay so I'm
23:05 - gonna check the chat one more time to
23:07 - see if anybody had any feedback some
23:09 - other people are saying hi I say hi back
23:11 - to you and now here we go okay okay so I
23:20 - got certain the air conditioning back
23:21 - down I'm going to hit record I'll start
23:25 - over here let me erase this first start
23:30 - the video out
23:35 - and going to get started
23:53 - previous video I just made looked at
23:56 - some the basics of a while loop in a for
23:58 - loop and all we really did was like a
23:59 - tiny little thing all I did was a I said
24:03 - we I like to say I there's no we here
24:07 - okay so the previous video that I just
24:12 - made I looked at the basics of the
24:15 - control structure of the loop
24:16 - so I looked at a while loop and a for
24:18 - loop and for loop is the primary loop
24:21 - that I'm going to use for the
24:22 - demonstrations in this particular video
24:24 - so there's a couple little items that I
24:25 - want to add on tack on to this
24:27 - discussion you know all we really did we
24:32 - it doesn't matter I can say we it's fine
24:34 - I'm gonna start this recording this one
24:36 - one more time and it's gonna be finished
24:39 - okay here we go okay I forgot what I was
24:45 - gonna say I'd like to make one more
24:49 - video about loops I mean I could
24:50 - probably make 10 more videos about
24:52 - Luke's but I think there was a couple
24:53 - key things that are missing from the
24:55 - previous video where all I did was
24:56 - something very basic showed you how the
24:58 - structure of the loop works and used it
25:01 - to draw a repeating shape so it's up to
25:03 - you to kind of try to do some creative
25:05 - things with that but I think there are
25:07 - two pieces of this puzzle that I would
25:09 - like to discuss that I think will help
25:10 - your knowledge a little bit so the first
25:13 - thing is that there's something a little
25:16 - bit strange going on oh shoot it's fine
25:20 - that camera went off but guess what it's
25:23 - back on the open update fine I'll start
25:25 - over every time we hit the button then
25:28 - the camera goes to the wrong location
25:31 - okay I'm gonna stop this am I here back
25:36 - nope this cameras off
25:42 - okay nope come back to me camera this
25:46 - camera is causing me all sorts of
25:48 - problems
25:48 - oh it's back okay this one is good this
25:57 - one is good except it's kind of I got I
26:01 - like turn it a little bit there we go
26:03 - that's better okay sorry everybody if
26:07 - anybody is actually watching this on the
26:09 - live stream you have to deal with my
26:11 - technical difficulties but I am now
26:14 - ready to try this again I forgot what I
26:21 - was saying okay so think about two more
26:25 - things loop within a loop yeah okay I
26:32 - got it I got it I got it walk did you
26:40 - know I'm gonna leave this in the video
26:41 - because this really happened and it's
26:43 - there so uh the previous video I made we
26:46 - looked at I just looked at really really
26:48 - the basics of the control structure of
26:49 - the loop a while loop a for loop for
26:52 - looping this for primary looping
26:53 - structure that I'm used for the rest of
26:55 - the examples and all I did was something
26:56 - very basic use it to draw a repeating
26:58 - shape and now it's up to you to figure
27:00 - out what kinds of creative things you
27:02 - can try to experiment with to create
27:04 - different new kinds of patterns that you
27:05 - haven't explored before but I think
27:07 - there are two key elements that I would
27:09 - like to discuss that I think will fill
27:12 - in a couple gaps in your in in your
27:14 - knowledge here that will help you do
27:16 - more stuff with loops so the first thing
27:18 - that I want to mention is you know we I
27:20 - started talking about loops as if this
27:22 - is this new thing but there actually is
27:25 - this draw function and the one of the
27:28 - very first things I looked at in an
27:29 - earlier video is this draw function is
27:31 - looping and every time you get to the
27:34 - end of the draw function the screen is
27:36 - updated then the draw function repeats
27:37 - stuff is drawn again screen is updated
27:40 - so sometimes it gets a little bit
27:41 - confusing here if you have this loop
27:43 - like there's this for loop that that I
27:46 - just created in the previous example
27:48 - which is inside the draw loop this is
27:51 - all that comes back together because
27:53 - this
27:53 - this video is all about nested loops
27:55 - because this is really a nested loop
27:57 - draws looping the for loop is looping
27:59 - but right the goal of this loop was to
28:03 - do what it was to draw multiple shapes
28:07 - repeat the same ellipse function over
28:09 - and over and over again however if you
28:12 - were if you're thinking about this kind
28:13 - of in most to much detail you might have
28:16 - noticed it's wow this loop is going it's
28:18 - not like you see like the first ellipse
28:20 - then you see the second one then you see
28:21 - the third one then you see that the
28:22 - fourth one you just see that all you
28:25 - might also think yourself okay well it's
28:26 - drawing them one at a time but it
28:28 - happened so fast it looks like it's just
28:29 - all of them so I would like to remind
28:31 - you that neither of those things is the
28:33 - case in fact the window the canvas is
28:36 - not updated until the end of draw is
28:39 - reached so the purpose of a four loop
28:43 - inside the draw loop is not to animate
28:46 - something but rather to draw a whole
28:49 - bunch of things for each cycle of the
28:52 - draw loop if you want to animate things
28:54 - you would have to do something slightly
28:55 - different so let's take a look in this
28:58 - particular example so I'm going to draw
29:00 - these back in the middle these circles
29:02 - so the circles are just there I'm seeing
29:05 - all of them nothing is changing I could
29:07 - do a couple things one I could add
29:09 - random for the blue value of the color
29:12 - and now we can see that can you see that
29:16 - whoa
29:17 - yeah that's really like the worst let me
29:20 - make this random too because you can
29:22 - barely see that now you can see that
29:24 - more right so you can see that draw is
29:26 - looping over and over again and the only
29:28 - thing that's changing is that the color
29:30 - is changing the location of these
29:32 - ellipses from that loop are staying the
29:34 - same I could do something kind of
29:35 - strange and I could say let me add a
29:38 - variable like offset and I could say
29:41 - draw every ellipse at the X X as part of
29:44 - this loop oh my goodness I'm flickering
29:46 - like crazy this camera is having
29:48 - problems but hopefully you're gonna be
29:49 - able to get through this video anyway
29:51 - the X X is the same every time through X
29:56 - is the same every time through draw
29:59 - because X is what's this is making me
30:02 - crazy governing the location of those
30:04 - goals but if I were to say offset equals
30:08 - offset plus one now you can see I'm
30:12 - offsetting the location of all of those
30:15 - by some amount so this dismay this is
30:18 - these are kind of like a few sort of
30:19 - strange quick things that I've added
30:21 - here but the point of what I wanted to
30:23 - make is you just need to keep that in
30:25 - mind write this draw loop is for the
30:27 - purpose of refreshing that flipbook
30:30 - metaphor I think works well or analogy
30:32 - so I'm going to correct me the the flip
30:36 - book idea right you've got a page and
30:38 - then a next page in the next page in the
30:39 - next page
30:40 - there's no flip book here this is in
30:42 - order to perform a repeating tasks on a
30:44 - single page in the flip book so
30:46 - animation so that's the first thing that
30:49 - I wanted to know the other thing that
30:51 - comes up very often is kind of related
30:54 - to this because what happens if now
30:57 - inside this loop I put another loop for
31:04 - every X do something to every Y and
31:07 - let's think about how that might be
31:09 - useful and this is a kind of algorithm
31:11 - or process that comes up over and over
31:15 - again and again in any sort of computer
31:17 - graphics programming and other kinds of
31:19 - programming as well why because the
31:22 - canvas the thing that we're drawing to
31:24 - is a 2-dimensional grid
31:26 - it has pixels along an x axis and it has
31:30 - pixels along the y axis so if I would
31:33 - like to draw something for every X fill
31:37 - in all the Y's so for the first X do all
31:41 - the Y's for the next X do all the Y's
31:43 - now for the next X do all the Y's the
31:47 - way that that works is to say for VAR x
31:52 - equals 0 the rest of the for loop and
31:55 - then for every X assuming this X is
31:58 - going up every time you do an X also do
32:03 - a Y so this is a little tricky to get
32:05 - used to but it's incredibly powerful it
32:08 - will open up a lot of possibilities you
32:09 - know you want to program a game that
32:12 - involves a 2-dimensional board of cells
32:14 - like
32:15 - sir checkers you're gonna need some sort
32:17 - of structure like this if you want to
32:18 - learn about image processing how do you
32:20 - read every pixel of an image and make
32:22 - that pixel a little brighter a little
32:23 - darker or apply some other kind of
32:25 - effect you're gonna need this kind of
32:26 - loop so it comes up over and over again
32:28 - in so many things so let's look at that
32:30 - applying the code and I'm still here
32:32 - okay I won't flicker and disappear too
32:34 - much so what I'm going to do I'm gonna
32:37 - get rid of this I'm gonna save this
32:40 - project as I'm saving these because
32:43 - someday I will upload them somewhere I
32:45 - suppose I am going to remove this weird
32:48 - offset thing I'll keep the random fill
32:53 - why not we don't need this offset and
32:56 - what I want to do is add right here
32:59 - another loop for y equals zero Y is less
33:06 - than or equal to height Y goes up by 50
33:09 - and draw the ellipse at X comma Y so all
33:12 - I did is now this is the exactly we're
33:15 - talking about for every X do every Y so
33:18 - my first X do all the Y's the next X do
33:20 - all the Y's and let's see if this works
33:22 - whew it did so now we have this perfect
33:27 - grid of circles flashing random colors
33:30 - all over the window you know how could
33:32 - you make those colors not random how
33:34 - might you have likes apply some sort of
33:36 - pattern to it how might you do all sorts
33:37 - of interesting things like have those
33:39 - circles start to shake a little bit
33:40 - that's a little bit more complicated
33:41 - that you're gonna need some other tools
33:43 - and objects and rays for a bit more but
33:45 - you can start to think about all these
33:48 - possibilities and I just want to point
33:50 - out that again if I were to take this
33:54 - loop and I did this sort of backwards I
33:57 - don't know why I'm showing you this
33:58 - because it works so nicely but if I were
34:01 - to not do it this way right if I were to
34:05 - do this two loops right this is what
34:12 - I've got with two separate loops I'm
34:14 - doing all the X's along the Y column 200
34:17 - and now I'm doing all the Y's along the
34:20 - X sorry along the Y row 200 I'm doing
34:23 - all the Y's in the X column 200 so I
34:26 - don't know I had this
34:27 - my nose can show you this first and so
34:28 - now I'm like showing this after which
34:29 - really doesn't make a lot of sense but
34:31 - I'm just like leg this video fly with
34:33 - all of its weirdness and errors so let
34:35 - me go back to what it was correctly that
34:37 - was sort of like pointless to take that
34:41 - out and we could I think this is a nicer
34:42 - place to end looking at this again so
34:45 - what I've talked now about really very
34:47 - little but kind of giving you a running
34:49 - start here into thinking about loops a
34:51 - loop is something to repeat a certain
34:53 - task during one cycle of drama you can
34:56 - use a loop anywhere but right now I'm
34:57 - using it to draw multiple copies of a
35:00 - shape inside of draw you can also use a
35:05 - nested loop to see a grid if draw
35:07 - remember is the flip book so each time
35:10 - through draw if you change some aspect
35:12 - of the loop you know I just thought of
35:14 - something really interesting that we
35:15 - could try like for example everything
35:17 - can be a variable right here the X loop
35:20 - stops at width
35:21 - what if I were to put mouse X here so I
35:25 - just want to dynamically loop up to
35:28 - where the mouse is so now this loop
35:30 - remember is executing every single time
35:32 - but the exit condition is changing every
35:34 - time through Drive you're still watching
35:36 - this was a little nugget here that's
35:38 - that's hopefully useful okay so that
35:40 - gives you the basics about Luke's how
35:42 - loop works within draw how you have a
35:45 - nested loop and I need to make one more
35:47 - video which won't happen today because I
35:49 - now have to go do something else but I
35:50 - want to look at an array and how a loop
35:52 - relates to that okay thank you and
35:55 - goodbye this is where I need to click ok
36:01 - live stream I don't know if anybody
36:05 - enjoyed that there's a few people
36:06 - watching I'm gonna go now I'm gonna turn
36:08 - off this live stream so this video is
36:09 - there now on YouTube of just the kind of
36:12 - rambling live stream thing but I'm gonna
36:15 - upload the actual they're not edited but
36:17 - the the sections that are like of just
36:20 - the continuous lesson material upload
36:22 - those as well okay goodbye I don't know
36:24 - I have to go click on live control room
36:27 - and you can see this button here I am
36:30 - now going to push this button it says
36:32 - stop streaming and if this was 36
36:34 - minutes and stop
36:35 - Oh something else came up yes I'm sure
