00:00 - hello and welcome to another computer
00:05 - vision video this is a follow-up video
00:07 - on my previous one where I'm going to
00:09 - talk about something called I don't know
00:12 - it's called
00:12 - I'm gonna fix a problem with this
00:14 - particular video look what happens if I
00:15 - like shake this blob around a lot
00:17 - notice how the ID numbers going up and
00:19 - up and up and up and up because even
00:21 - though it's the same blob it's the
00:22 - computer vision algorithm and it doesn't
00:24 - detect it for a brief moment so it
00:26 - deletes it and then it comes back and it
00:27 - gives it a new ID but I want to build
00:29 - something into the algorithm so that
00:31 - even if the blob leaves for a very short
00:33 - period of time
00:34 - it doesn't actually get a new ID unless
00:36 - it's really gone for a significant
00:38 - period of time and that's the difficulty
00:39 - of time could just be like a few
00:41 - milliseconds but I'll getting used to us
00:43 - a minute I'm not a minute
00:44 - a second or five seconds or 10 seconds
00:46 - so the first thing that I need to do is
00:48 - I just need to add to the blob I'm gonna
00:51 - add this idea do you have an idea idea
00:53 - of a timer I'm gonna set the timer equal
00:56 - to 100 and then what I want to do is the
01:00 - other thing I want to do just for
01:01 - debugging purposes is I want to take a
01:04 - look I want to be able to see the timer
01:05 - and I'm gonna put it above the blob I
01:08 - mean why minus 10 and I'm gonna just
01:10 - make it half the size Oh what I'm going
01:13 - to do and let's just see if this works
01:15 - now we should see that every blob now
01:20 - has a timer associated with it
01:21 - now nothing's happening with that timer
01:23 - but maybe what I'll do is write a
01:26 - function in the blob I don't know what
01:29 - to call it uh fade-out huh I don't fade
01:33 - well I'll just call it update update
01:36 - sort of weird that's not the right
01:37 - whatever somebody somebody will come up
01:39 - with a good a good name for that
01:41 - function and suggest it I'll think of it
01:43 - later in the chat maybe somebody will
01:45 - notice and tell me okay so what I'm
01:46 - gonna do just for the sake of argument
01:47 - right now I'm gonna call update always
01:51 - and you'll see what's going on
01:54 - so now when a blob comes up you could
01:58 - see that the timer is going down and
02:01 - every time I get a new blob the timer
02:04 - starts back at 100 so here's the thing I
02:07 - don't want to actually delete the blob
02:10 - unless it's
02:11 - Oh 2-0 and I don't actually want its
02:13 - timer to always go down I only want its
02:15 - timer to go down if it can't find
02:17 - something to match to so this actually
02:21 - should just be here right in this last
02:24 - scenario right the last scenario is if
02:29 - option through yet I could delete this
02:31 - right if there are more blobs than the
02:34 - computer vision algorithm is currently
02:36 - detecting then whatever whatever blobs
02:39 - did not get matched get deleted in this
02:41 - case don't actually delete them just
02:44 - update the timer so I'm gonna call
02:50 - update and then I'm gonna say if I do
02:55 - you know I'm gonna do I'm just gonna
02:56 - write a function called check check
02:59 - timer that's what I'll call it and then
03:04 - because I'm also gonna have a return
03:06 - true or false and then only if it
03:08 - returns true then actually remove it so
03:14 - in this case and there's gonna be some
03:16 - issues with this so I'm gonna call this
03:19 - boolean check timer and then timer - -
03:24 - if timer is less than 0 then return true
03:29 - otherwise return false and I know I know
03:32 - I could just say return timers less than
03:35 - zero because it evaluates to true or
03:37 - false but I'd like to be just sort of
03:39 - long-winded about this just so people
03:40 - can really see what's going on yeah
03:44 - timer isn't really something that Chad
03:45 - is saying that timer isn't really
03:47 - related to time and that's actually true
03:49 - so actually why don't I call it like
03:50 - lifespan and that way
03:57 - check life that way I'm just sort of if
04:01 - I could have said counter but I don't
04:02 - know why I didn't so and I'm gonna just
04:04 - do this okay so so check life always up
04:07 - so no so let's take a look at this
04:09 - unless eoqs and now I just need to
04:11 - update this with lifespan as well so
04:14 - let's see now what happens here let's
04:18 - see what this gets us so look you can
04:20 - see that that blob exists and it's got a
04:22 - lifespan currently of
04:23 - now if I take it away it's timers going
04:26 - down hope it went to one but if I come
04:29 - back but look at that its lifespan is
04:31 - now at forty five so up up it's two so
04:35 - one of the thing is when it gets matched
04:37 - I need its lifespan needs to go back to
04:40 - one hundred so wait how do I know when
04:44 - it gets matched here is when it gets
04:47 - matched so if and this should really go
04:49 - into a function probably but I'm gonna
04:51 - just gonna be a little hacky about this
04:53 - right now I'm just gonna say lifespan
04:54 - equals 100 so that'll reset its lifespan
04:57 - back to 100 another thing I'm gonna do
04:58 - is I'm actually just gonna make the
05:00 - lifespan to 55 because I think what
05:03 - would be nice is to look at this to
05:06 - debug this actually when I'm drawing it
05:08 - where do I draw the blob I can't even
05:10 - find it anymore I'm gonna actually use
05:12 - its lifespan as its alpha actually going
05:15 - to leave it at 200 and then maybe I
05:17 - won't bother to draw the I won't bother
05:21 - to draw the lifespan right now so let's
05:23 - take a look at this and let's see how
05:26 - this works so I now have two blobs 0 & 1
05:31 - they're gonna leave the screen and I'm
05:34 - gonna come back and there's still 0 in
05:35 - one they're gonna leave and they're
05:37 - gonna come back and there's still 0 1 I
05:39 - could do this and it's probably not
05:42 - being detected but they're still there
05:44 - they're still 0 & 1 now what if I really
05:46 - what if they really leave I don't think
05:50 - the lifespan got reset properly right
05:53 - let's come back right it still looks
05:57 - like it's alpha II ah so there's a bug
05:59 - there the idea is right but I have a
06:01 - still have a bug in the code my lifespan
06:03 - didn't get set correctly what did I what
06:05 - what happened mmm matched lifespan hmm
06:13 - Oh 100 that's why because I'm starting
06:15 - to the 200 okay so that should be a
06:18 - variable and I should have that as a
06:19 - function so I don't make that mistake
06:24 - okay so so let me try this again
06:31 - 0 & 1 leave they're fading out whoops
06:35 - does they come back I love this
06:37 - so this is nice these are my blobs 0 & 1
06:39 - where's my other cup wait I had a third
06:41 - no it's on the floor let's see does it
06:43 - do 0 & 1 still exist I was fast enough
06:46 - so you can see how I've got 2 3 there we
06:50 - go
06:50 - 0 1 2 & 3 I don't know why that one
06:53 - disappeared for a while so you can see
06:55 - how the the IDs are actually
06:56 - interestingly enough they even they even
06:59 - keep themselves as they kind of overlap
07:01 - a little bit so I don't know you get the
07:02 - idea so this I think is a pretty robust
07:05 - solution for ID numbers here's the thing
07:07 - by the way all of this effort in will
07:09 - hurt guess what if I just had a red cup
07:12 - and a blue Cup I could use the color to
07:14 - keep track of which one is which but you
07:16 - know you might have the case where
07:17 - you're using like multi-touch with
07:19 - figures and you're using infrared light
07:20 - you're just seeing these bright white
07:22 - blobby things and you want to which
07:23 - finger it's which and again my system
07:26 - the other thing I should mention here is
07:27 - my system for determining which is which
07:29 - is just based on distance so in other
07:31 - words like this is 7 & 8 right now but
07:34 - let me cross them over that I don't
07:37 - think that worked right yeah oh no it
07:40 - kind of somehow did but you could see
07:42 - like I might a better you know I hit add
07:44 - more sophisticated things like I could
07:46 - use the blob size to kind of try to help
07:49 - match like oh well Bob should have a
07:50 - similar size to what it had previously
07:51 - or I could actually try to predict where
07:53 - it's going to be next because I could
07:54 - keep track of that blobs velocity over
07:56 - time so if anyone makes these
07:58 - improvements or adds to these examples
07:59 - of sort of refinements of this code
08:01 - please let me know and otherwise this is
08:04 - now lobbed I think this ends my blob
08:07 - detection with persistence video oh
08:09 - maybe we need a good thumbnail for this
08:11 - I don't need to be doing this during the
08:16 - video wait Bob 15 go away there we go I
08:21 - should mention by the way that a
08:23 - variable that really makes a big
08:25 - difference here and I'm gonna actually
08:28 - add this I'm gonna say max life I had it
08:32 - at 200 right so let me look for 200 I'm
08:36 - gonna say max life and then also here
08:40 - max life you know playing with this
08:45 - variable is going to make a really big
08:46 - difference because maybe you actually do
08:49 - want it to be a new blog
08:51 - if it leaves the screen like and comes
08:54 - back rather quickly but you don't want
08:56 - really really quick losses to result in
08:58 - a new blob so how you how long you let a
09:01 - blob survive is really kind of a crucial
09:04 - variable in this kind of system okay and
09:07 - so thanks for watching this computer
09:09 - vision tutorial and there will be more
09:10 - in the future there you might have been
09:12 - watching this like at some point where
09:13 - there already are a lot more goodbye
