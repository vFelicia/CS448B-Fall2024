00:00 - - Working with node, oh we're almost done.
00:02 - So the other thing that I do
is I work a lot with node.
00:05 - And I especially use
different node packages
00:08 - as utilities to run on the computer.
00:10 - I also write node code,
00:12 - but that's a separate
topic for another tutorial,
00:14 - but I write node code with the,
00:16 - with a text editor and run commands
00:20 - via the terminal and
all that sort of stuff.
00:22 - So let's come back,
00:24 - here, and see.
00:26 - Now, do I have node installed?
00:29 - I'm going to just type node.
00:30 - I know I have node installed
because it gave me that prompt.
00:33 - So this is how I can actually
just type java script
00:36 - in an interactive way.
00:37 - Like I can say, let x equal five.
00:40 - And then I can say x and it shows me five.
00:42 - This is like an interactive console here.
00:44 - And then I can just say, I think,
00:45 - control c?
00:48 - And I can get out of that.
00:49 - Now.
00:50 - I'm going to just go back to the desktop.
00:54 - So I have node installed.
00:56 - If you don't have node installed,
00:57 - there are many different ways
00:59 - you can install it but I
think if you go to nodejs.org,
01:02 - you can get it.
01:03 - Now let's see what version I have,
01:04 - this is probably going
to be very embarrassing.
01:06 - Oh, not so embarrassing!
01:07 - 10.8.
01:08 - So you can see, I'm a little bit behind
01:10 - but then this is recommended.
01:12 - But you know, live on the edge.
01:14 - There obviously are key
things in certain versions
01:16 - most of the stuff that I'm
doing, it doesn't matter so much.
01:19 - So I have a fairly recent version,
01:21 - now do I have something called npm?
01:24 - Npm should come with node
when you've installed it,
01:27 - but just to be sure I'm going to type npm
01:30 - and it looks like I have
it 'cause it's not saying
01:31 - it doesn't know what it is.
01:32 - So npm is node pkg manager.
01:35 - It's how I am going to
install node packages.
01:38 - And I'm going to show you
something really important
01:40 - right now.
01:40 - So what I want to do first,
01:42 - is let's use http server.
01:45 - Http server is a way, actually,
01:48 - yeah, let's use http server.
01:50 - Http server is a node package
for running a web server
01:54 - from the console on your computer.
01:56 - And you can use it for other things too.
01:57 - So I want, normally a
node package is something
02:00 - a module that you install
for a particular project
02:02 - and it lives with that project.
02:04 - I'm going to solve this globally
because I want to use it
02:05 - as a global utility on my computer.
02:07 - But there's two, multiple kinds of global
02:10 - that you might not be aware of.
02:11 - So I'm going to now say,
02:13 - npm install
02:15 - what was it called?
02:16 - Http server -g,
02:18 - the -g for global.
02:20 - And I know there's something called Yarn,
02:21 - which is another way to install
your package, but you know,
02:24 - oh, I can't do everything
new all the time!
02:27 - So I'm going to hit enter,
02:27 - and it's going to give me an error.
02:29 - This error is so common.
02:31 - And it's a permissions error, it's like,
02:33 - I don't have authority to
install something global
02:36 - on your computer.
02:37 - And you're going to be tempted to do this.
02:39 - Sudo npm install http-server -g
02:44 - what this means, sudo means super user do,
02:48 - and it's saying, you know
what, I do have permission,
02:50 - I'm the administrator of this computer,
02:52 - I want this to be global, across
all users of the computer.
02:56 - But that actually is
probably not what you want.
02:59 - What you more likely want is
global packages but for you,
03:03 - in your home user account.
03:05 - It's a fine line but you're computer
03:08 - has stuff installed in
a like, really further,
03:12 - further down the chain of
file directories that are,
03:15 - any user can use.
03:16 - Like the applications, or it
has configurations and things
03:19 - for just the user that's logged in.
03:21 - So there is a way to deal with this.
03:24 - And the way to do that is,
03:26 - I'm going to just look
for fix permissions npm.
03:29 - There's a guide for it on the npm website.
03:33 - And it's, the way that I
like to do this, is this.
03:36 - So I want to make a hidden
directory called npm global.
03:41 - So I'm just going to copy
this right from here.
03:44 - And I'm going to put it in here.
03:46 - Then I want to tell npm that
03:49 - that's where I want my
global packages to be.
03:54 - Now here's the thing,
03:56 - it's going to want me
to add that to the path.
04:00 - Because I'm adding something
new that the computer needs
04:02 - to know to look there to find things,
04:04 - it needs to be part of the path.
04:05 - But guess what?
04:06 - Uh, maybe not .profile
04:09 - this is the default bash profile.
04:12 - Actually what I want to do is take this,
04:14 - since I'm using zsh, but again,
04:16 - and I want to say,
04:19 - code .zshrc
04:24 - so I want to edit this file,
04:25 - and I'm going to add another thing,
04:27 - I'm going to add it, the path here.
04:30 - So it should be available.
04:32 - And then I'm going to say
source to reactivate it,
04:35 - I only have to do this once.
04:36 - Or I could restart terminal.
04:39 - And then now I should be, that's
a little variation of this.
04:43 - That's what, that's
the equivalent of this.
04:44 - And now, I should be able to say
04:49 - without sudo, no sudo,
04:52 - do this
04:53 - install and look it did it and guess what?
04:55 - I'm going to go to the finder,
04:57 - I'm going to look here,
there's a new hidden directory
05:00 - called npm global, bin, http server, lib,
05:05 - this is where it lives.
05:05 - So a lot of times this
stuff seems like magic,
05:08 - it's just putting more
files on your computer
05:10 - and then telling you about where they are
05:12 - and then you have,
05:13 - and staving where that stuff
is in the path variable.
05:16 - Okay.
05:17 - So now we've got http server,
05:18 - this means that I can
just run http server,
05:21 - there you go,
05:22 - I'm running a server, I'll
show you why I want to do that
05:24 - in a second.
05:24 - But instead, I'm going to,
05:26 - the next thing I'm going to
do is going to do npm install
05:28 - p5 manager -g.
05:31 - So this is installing p5 manager.
05:34 - Take a little second there.
05:42 - Okay, installed,
05:43 - and now
05:45 - now I can do things like, p5 generate
05:50 - - -bundle mysketch
05:54 - or something so I can create a p5 sketch.
05:56 - And it actually just
created all of these files.
06:00 - I can go cd mysketch.
06:02 - Now the truth of the matter
is p5, the p5 manager
06:05 - comes with it's own server.
06:06 - But, for whatever weird
reason, I'm just used to using
06:11 - http server.
06:12 - If I hit command and I click on this,
06:15 - it will open it in the browser
and there's the sketch.
06:18 - Now there's nothing appearing
so maybe I want to edit it.
06:21 - Now how's another thing
I want to show you.
06:22 - (laughs)
06:23 - I got the server running here,
06:25 - so ah, I don't want to stop the server
06:28 - but I want to do more stuff
06:29 - in the console.
06:30 - I can hit command T and
that opens a new tab.
06:33 - But I'm not in the same directory,
06:35 - so if I want to be in the same directory,
06:39 - I'm going to go to preferences again,
06:42 - and I'm going to go to
profiles under default
06:45 - and I could create different profiles
06:46 - with different settings,
06:47 - but this is what I want.
06:49 - I want to reuse previous
session's directory.
06:52 - So if I click that,
06:53 - and then I close it, and I hit,
06:55 - now I hit command t for a new tab,
06:57 - there we go, I'm still in mysketch.
07:00 - I can do code dot.
07:03 - I've now, I'm now looking at
mysketch in visual studio code.
07:07 - I will add background 255, 0, 100
07:11 - it will auto format it when I hit save,
07:14 - and then I'm going to come
back here and hit refresh.
07:17 - Oh no!
07:18 - Where's the new code?
07:19 - So this is really a key thing.
07:21 - Browsers want to cache, all the time.
07:24 - So there's many ways around this, but,
07:27 - and by the way, didn't even show you,
07:29 - you might look like this for you,
07:30 - I did something without
even thinking about it.
07:32 - I always while I'm working,
07:34 - like too have the developer tools open,
07:36 - View, developer, JavaScript console.
07:38 - I usually open it by
doing option command J
07:41 - and there it is.
07:43 - And then I want to make that
font bigger so you can see it.
07:46 - But there's a really important setting
07:48 - that is really going to help you out.
07:51 - Settings, and I can go down under network,
07:55 - I like this one.
07:56 - Disable cache while DevTools are open.
07:58 - So this'll mean it'll
always reload any changes
08:01 - in your code, while you
have those DevTools open,
08:03 - the browser won't cache it by accident.
08:05 - So now if I select that,
08:07 - and I hit, if I hit refresh here,
08:10 - there we go, we've got the P5 sketch.
08:13 - Now here's the thing.
08:14 - What if you want to just,
now so if I change it,
08:18 - 100, 255.
08:21 - I've got to go back into
the browser and hit refresh.
08:23 - Which is fine, I don't mind doing that.
08:25 - But!
08:27 - I could also
08:30 - control c out of http server,
08:32 - I could say npm install live-server -g,
08:37 - this is a different server package,
08:39 - and again I'm sure visual
studio code has plug in,
08:41 - has extensions for running
servers so you don't have,
08:44 - there are so many different
ways of doing this,
08:46 - no one way is correct.
08:47 - But now if I do live server,
08:50 - 'cause it launched it
automatically, and then
08:53 - if I change the code 255, 0, 100 hit save,
08:59 - hmm, let's see.
09:00 - It detected it,
09:01 - I wonder why it didn't change.
09:05 - Did I not hit save?
09:07 - I've seen this happen before.
09:08 - If I hit refresh, oh live,
maybe live reload enabled
09:13 - didn't get enabled.
09:14 - Let me see.
09:15 - But let me try this again.
09:17 - I don't know why that didn't work.
09:18 - And I'm going to say 100, 0, 255.
09:22 - Hit save.
09:24 - And it changed.
09:25 - Yes, so we can actually if I
were more thoughtful about this
09:29 - and put this over here,
09:31 - and put this here,
09:32 - so you can kind of see it,
09:34 - you can see it's just changing
every time I hit save.
09:37 - I know I'm standing in front of the code,
09:40 - but that's it's going
to update dynamically.
09:44 - So that's something that can be useful
09:46 - if you want it to live reload.
09:48 - All the time.
09:50 - Alright,
09:51 - so this is pretty much my entire workflow,
09:54 - I think this, I would
like to make a video about
09:57 - setting up virtual environment for Python,
09:59 - I'll come back to that,
10:02 - I'm going to use that for
some projects in the future.
10:04 - But this is pretty much everything I use.
10:06 - So many things are missing,
so many people in the chat
10:09 - are like posting their
suggestions or like,
10:10 - this text editor, or this
thing called tmx maybe
10:14 - is really good for zsh.
10:16 - So I encourage you to put all
that stuff in the comments
10:18 - of these videos
10:19 - and maybe we can make a read me file
10:20 - that people can contribute to,
10:22 - but this is basically it.
10:24 - Most of the time I try
to use these all in one
10:26 - kind of packages for coding.
10:27 - I would also mention Glitch
10:29 - which allows you to do node stuff as well
10:31 - Glitch.com is a great one,
OpenProcessing is a great one.
10:34 - But when I'm working
locally on the computer,
10:37 - I use a text editor, I'm trying
to use visual studio code,
10:41 - I need console access
to run shell commands,
10:44 - I'm using iTerm with a zsh,
configure with the oh-my-zsh
10:48 - I do all my git commands there,
10:52 - I do all my node commands there,
10:53 - I use these node global packages,
10:56 - and there's one other thing I thought of,
11:00 - so the one other thing
I thought of is actually
11:02 - this p5 manager
11:04 - I often, what you'll notice
when it created this sketch,
11:09 - it made, it had like setup and draw in it,
11:12 - it had some stuff in
index in html already,
11:15 - this is a template that you can modify.
11:17 - So you can actually go in by the way,
11:20 - you can find it now,
11:22 - p5 manager, probably somewhere in here
11:25 - is the, no this is the source code for it,
11:29 - generator, libraries, templates,
11:31 - ah there we go!
11:32 - Look, so this is the template,
11:34 - so I could actually modify this
11:36 - and I could probably
make different templates,
11:37 - you'd have to look in the documentation,
11:38 - where do you find out about node packages?
11:40 - You know, google them
you'll find the Github repo,
11:43 - or there's a, every node package is at
11:47 - npmjs.org,
11:50 - so if I were to search for a p5 manager,
11:53 - I have some videos on p5 manager itself,
11:56 - we could find out here that
there is more documentation
11:59 - for all the different
things you can do with it.
12:01 - So everything to infinity,
12:03 - I could keep going about all these things,
12:05 - one of the question, sorry,
one other question in the chat
12:08 - how is opening server url different
12:12 - from opening an html file?
12:13 - This is a great question,
I'm glad you asked that.
12:16 - Those of you actually somehow
managing to watch til the end
12:18 - of this video are going to
get a little bonus here.
12:20 - Right this mysketch, I can
just click this index on html
12:25 - and there it is in the browser also.
12:28 - And I can open up here,
12:29 - but there it is running,
but this is dangerous.
12:33 - Living dangerously is not the worst idea.
12:34 - File users temporary train.
12:37 - I'm opening it through the file system.
12:39 - A lot of things don't work.
12:42 - I would expect that webcam access,
12:44 - access to to the microphone,
loading image files won't work,
12:47 - there'll be all these errors
12:49 - because it's not hosted properly
12:51 - through a server.
12:52 - And so you'll notice here,
12:54 - the sketch is hosted through a server,
12:56 - and so this is going to,
12:58 - it's just safer and it sort of
emulates that real experience
13:01 - of publishing your project
to the web somewhere.
13:03 - So generally I try to stick to that habit,
13:05 - but you're right, for quick
working, just opening it as a,
13:08 - as through the file system will work.
13:11 - Okay,
13:12 - thank you everybody for
watching this series of videos
13:15 - about my current workflow,
13:17 - it's a little weird to make
this before I actually start
13:20 - using the workflow more
13:21 - but so things will change,
and if you can watch
13:23 - my videos, ask your questions, thank you,
13:25 - (kisses the air)
13:26 - I kiss my fingers like a chef,
13:28 - good by from The Coding Train.
13:29 - (whistle toot)
13:30 - (upbeat music)
