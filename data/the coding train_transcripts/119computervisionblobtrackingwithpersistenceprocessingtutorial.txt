00:00 - hello and welcome to another computer
00:02 - vision tutorial video so in this video
00:05 - I'm going to talk about persistence with
00:07 - blobs ID numbers with blobs so what do I
00:09 - mean by that so you can see this is a
00:11 - cup that's in my right hand and this is
00:13 - a cup that's in my left hand and I
00:15 - previously made two other videos about
00:17 - how to do this kind of blob tracking
00:18 - thing from scratch although in truth you
00:20 - might just want to use a library for it
00:22 - which I'll show you in a future video
00:23 - but even so most libraries won't even do
00:26 - the next step I mean some do I'm sure
00:28 - but a lot of libraries won't do the next
00:29 - step which I'm going to show you is how
00:31 - do I know that this is the same cup over
00:33 - time and that this is the same cup over
00:35 - time what if I always wanted to replace
00:37 - this cup with an image of a of a
00:39 - hedgehog and replace this cup with an
00:41 - image of a tortoise so uh you know I
00:44 - won't get into weird animal pictures in
00:46 - this video I'm just going to use numbers
00:47 - so let's look and see first what happens
00:50 - if I just try to number these cups so
00:53 - where am i drawing them I am drawing
00:56 - them right here in this uh in this loop
01:01 - right here I'm saying Oh first of all
01:02 - I'm only bothering to look at any blobs
01:05 - that have a sigh I don't I don't want to
01:07 - look at little blobs I forgot that I had
01:09 - that in there but I'm only showing blobs
01:11 - that have a particular size so one thing
01:14 - one thing that I could do is I could
01:16 - just say int I equals 0 and here I could
01:21 - say I plus plus I could just number them
01:24 - according to the order that they are in
01:25 - the array and I'm going to put I in here
01:29 - and then in the blob function it's going
01:32 - to get a number and right afterwards I
01:35 - could say a text-align:center and I'm
01:42 - going to say text size 6 I'm trying to
01:45 - make it big fill 0 and text that number
01:49 - and where should it be it should be at
01:51 - min X plus max X times this is like a
01:56 - little bit silly but I'm trying to find
01:57 - the middle of the blob you know I think
02:01 - I have a function called get X and no a
02:04 - different different different program I
02:06 - did that in max X minus min X times 0.5
02:11 - this is a little bit silly here but I'm
02:13 - just going to
02:14 - do this really quickly so you can see
02:16 - what I mean min why max why - min why
02:20 - you this is just me finding the center
02:22 - of that rectangle and now what I'm going
02:25 - to do is run this again and we should
02:29 - see some numbers come on blobs you can
02:34 - see I have a 0 and a 1 now first of all
02:36 - I forgot some things let's clean up some
02:39 - other stuff text size 64 I am drawing
02:41 - some others text text size 12 let's just
02:44 - leave that smaller and also you notice
02:47 - how it wasn't really in the center let's
02:50 - let's actually draw it just at the you
02:53 - know max Y - a little bit above the
02:56 - bottom the text so I should have added
03:01 - this before I started recording this
03:02 - video but now you can see the problem
03:04 - here's blob 0 Oh No here's Bob zero
03:07 - here's blob 1 watch this oh that's 0
03:11 - that's 1 that's 0 that's 1 that's 0
03:13 - that's 1 right because the order that
03:15 - I'm finding them just has to do with
03:17 - where they are like this I get this one
03:20 - is always going to be 0
03:21 - anything that's up at the top left right
03:23 - this is like way too much 1 so the order
03:26 - of the Iranian is nothing they're in a
03:28 - particular order in the rate just
03:29 - because the order that I found it and
03:31 - then you know what happens if I try to
03:33 - add a third one you can see that I can't
03:38 - reliably look I don't know what I'm
03:42 - doing anymore so I need a better system
03:44 - for this the blob detects the point of
03:47 - this is that the blob detection
03:49 - algorithm doesn't take into account time
03:52 - or history of a scene that it's looking
03:55 - at the only thing it takes into account
03:57 - is this instantaneous moment and it says
03:59 - here are the blobs that I see right now
04:01 - in some arbitrary order so in order to
04:05 - be able to track the which blob is which
04:07 - over time we need some methodology for
04:10 - doing that and in that sense we need
04:11 - another object so the particular program
04:15 - that I wrote in the previous videos has
04:17 - this a blob class which keeps track of a
04:21 - blob object but what the program does is
04:24 - it says it takes a scene which might
04:26 - have two
04:27 - it just says let me find the blobs in
04:29 - that scene and then let me erase them
04:31 - and let me look again and find the blobs
04:33 - in the scene let me erase them let me
04:35 - look again so I'm not keeping track of a
04:37 - history so what I want to do is add a
04:39 - new ArrayList which is essentially going
04:42 - to persist over time
04:44 - so this ArrayList in the first frame the
04:47 - first frame of the program if it sees
04:49 - two blobs it takes those two blobs and
04:51 - you can think of this as the the
04:53 - ArrayList that's persisting over time it
04:56 - then puts two blobs in that ArrayList
04:58 - and then it goes and looks at the you
05:00 - know the next frame it looks at for the
05:02 - blobs again and maybe it finds two blobs
05:04 - it tries to match them with what's in
05:06 - that in that history so and then
05:08 - suddenly if there were three blobs well
05:10 - we have to match which one is aid which
05:12 - one is B and then create a new one and
05:14 - then what if it suddenly only sees one
05:16 - blob well then it needs to find which
05:19 - one of these matches and then delete the
05:21 - other two so we're essentially always
05:22 - looking at what are the current blobs
05:24 - what were the previous blobs and can we
05:26 - match which one is which and which opens
05:29 - a very interesting question like how do
05:30 - we match which one is which which I will
05:32 - get to in a moment okay
05:33 - so let's come back here and what let's
05:37 - look at the code and sort of see where
05:39 - are we going to add this stuff so you
05:42 - can see there already is this array list
05:45 - called blobs but I'm going to change
05:48 - this I'm going to add another ArrayList
05:50 - and I'm going to say current blobs so
05:55 - current blobs are the current blobs for
05:58 - this particular frame and the ArrayList
06:00 - blobs will actually store the blobs over
06:03 - time that persistence that history of
06:05 - blobs so one thing I want to change
06:07 - right now is just change all of this so
06:11 - I need to look at current blobs instead
06:14 - right here and I need to also add this
06:17 - to current blobs and then here I want to
06:20 - look at all the current blobs so this
06:22 - should be
06:23 - whoops sorry this is wrong I want to add
06:26 - the blob to current blobs so this should
06:29 - be and this should be current blob so
06:31 - this is still the same exact program
06:33 - same exact program but I'm just calling
06:35 - the thing current blobs and you can see
06:38 - whoa
06:39 - something crazy has happened what
06:41 - happened I forgot something really
06:43 - important which is that I need to say
06:46 - current blobs dot clear now I want to
06:49 - back out of some things that I did
06:50 - previously I don't want to use this
06:52 - arbitrary index into the array as a way
06:55 - of giving the blobs an ID obviously
06:57 - we're doing to do something more
06:57 - sophisticated that's the whole point of
07:00 - doing this program but I'm going to
07:02 - leave this code in here that draws the
07:05 - number what I'm going to do is I'm going
07:06 - to give the blobs an ID number okay and
07:12 - that way every time we make a new blob
07:15 - it gets its particular ID so that's
07:17 - going to be right now all the blobs have
07:18 - an ID of zero and the other thing I want
07:21 - to change here is before when I was just
07:23 - showing the current blobs I was
07:24 - eliminating blah small blobs by just not
07:26 - showing them but what would make more
07:28 - sense honestly would be for me here
07:31 - right after I found all the blobs to
07:33 - just delete any small ones I'm going to
07:39 - go through the array backwards is
07:43 - greater than or equal to zero I - - and
07:48 - if and if blobs get index I dot size is
07:54 - greater than 500 then actually is remove
07:58 - the right function remove that
08:00 - particular bomb so what I want to do is
08:02 - is at the end of all of this right first
08:04 - I want to analyze the image and find the
08:06 - blobs that are in it then I want to
08:08 - delete any small blobs and by the way
08:13 - this is current blobs very important
08:15 - that I say current blobs current blobs
08:17 - current Bluffs and actually just to be
08:19 - totally clear about what's going on is I
08:21 - don't even want to have this as a global
08:24 - variable I want to just take this and
08:26 - instead of saying current blobs are
08:28 - clear every frame I'm going to make a
08:30 - new ArrayList called current blobs
08:31 - because I'm just going to look at what
08:34 - the current blobs are and then down here
08:36 - once I've analyzed or move all the blobs
08:39 - now this is the part writing to match
08:42 - current globs with blobs so now I want
08:49 - to go back to the whiteboard because we
08:51 - have a very important
08:53 - question to ask what are the three
09:00 - possible ways that current blobs and
09:05 - blobs could relate to each other that
09:07 - was a very awkward way of phrasing that
09:08 - question but basically there are there
09:11 - could be more current blobs than blobs
09:19 - right this is the case where I might see
09:22 - three current blobs
09:23 - but in my history there's only one so
09:26 - previously there was only one there
09:27 - could be fewer current then blobs so I
09:34 - could have just say only seeing two
09:36 - blobs but I had four previously or there
09:40 - could be equal equal blobs
09:42 - so there could previously have been two
09:45 - and there could now currently be two so
09:47 - I need to account for all three of these
09:49 - possible scenarios and you can see what
09:51 - I might do like Oh in this case I need
09:53 - to add two more blocks or in this case I
09:55 - need to delete two blobs or in this case
09:57 - I just need to match these two with
09:59 - these two so let's first look at the
10:02 - first scenario which is what if a
10:07 - current a current loves dot size is
10:13 - greater then curve blobs dot size is
10:20 - greater than blobs dot size okay so
10:24 - that's let's let's consider that as the
10:26 - first error and actually you know what
10:27 - I'm going to be a little bit I've been
10:29 - have to make things easier on myself I
10:31 - might be able to combine this stuff
10:32 - later but really I could just say what
10:34 - if blobs is empty if my history of blobs
10:39 - is empty that any blobs that are in
10:42 - current blobs need to be part of that
10:43 - history so I could just say for all
10:46 - blobs that are all blobs that are in
10:49 - current blobs blobs dot at B so this is
10:55 - this is possibility one there are no
10:58 - Bluffs possibility number one there are
11:01 - no blobs so I don't have to do any
11:03 - matching just add them all
11:04 - now I'm going to do something else else
11:06 - if blobs dot size equals current blobs
11:13 - dot size okay so what I'm going to do
11:20 - now is I'm going to now look at just the
11:23 - second scenario what if I previously had
11:26 - two blobs and now oh and here's the
11:30 - other thing by the way I should give
11:31 - them an ID number and let's actually
11:33 - keep track of a counter blob counter set
11:41 - it equal to zero so I'm going to just
11:43 - keep counting up and give them ideas
11:45 - over time so here's where I want to set
11:51 - this is where if I'm ever adding a blob
11:54 - I want to give it a particular ID and
11:58 - then who did it I'm losing my mind and
12:05 - then I want to say a blob counter plus
12:10 - plus okay so now we need now we need a
12:13 - method for saying I have these current
12:15 - blobs I have these previous blobs which
12:18 - one is which and so the method I'm going
12:20 - to use right now is a really simple one
12:22 - I'm just going to say if I'm a blob
12:24 - that's detected let me find a blob in
12:27 - the previous flame that praying frame a
12:28 - previous frame that I'm closest to we
12:31 - could do more sophisticated things by
12:33 - looking at the velocity of a blob over
12:35 - time in which way it's moving and try to
12:37 - predict its location and look at its
12:38 - size and also do matching with that but
12:41 - you know all that stuff is kind of
12:42 - dressing that we could add on later to
12:44 - make it more accurate
12:45 - I want something basic that's going to
12:46 - sort of be good enough so I just want to
12:49 - look for the closest so the first thing
12:52 - I'm gonna do is say for all blobs in uh
12:58 - my current blobs I then want to look at
13:04 - all and sorry bye wait that's my history
13:06 - of blobs my naming is a little confusing
13:08 - here I want to look at all for all
13:12 - current blobs in current blobs
13:16 - and here I want to have record distance
13:20 - is I'm going to make up some really big
13:23 - number right I'm just going to say and
13:26 - you know I'm just going to use the the
13:27 - processing distance function I'm not
13:29 - going to worry about square roots so I'm
13:30 - going to say record distance is like a
13:32 - thousand pixels away and I'm going to
13:34 - say first give me the distance between
13:38 - ah now I really need I really want to
13:42 - have a variable that keeps track of the
13:44 - center of the blob because the way my
13:47 - variables are they're keeping track of
13:48 - the top left in the bottom right of the
13:50 - blob so I think what I should do is make
13:54 - a variable called I'm just going to call
13:56 - it actually X you know what I think I'll
14:01 - just calculate it on the fly I'm going
14:03 - to write a function this is a little bit
14:04 - goofy I'm going to write a function
14:06 - called X which I don't like that I'm
14:09 - gonna say get X which returns max X
14:12 - minus min X times 0.5 plus min X right
14:18 - that's the that's the left side of the
14:21 - blob plus the width of the blob which is
14:23 - the maximum minus the minimum divided by
14:24 - two so and actually I'm going to just
14:28 - call this get center and I'm going to
14:30 - return a new P vector that has and I'm
14:35 - going to be long-winded about this this
14:38 - is the X and this is the Y this is
14:45 - turning into a rather long video and I'm
14:48 - going to return a P vector X Y so I
14:51 - think I'm going to need this quite a bit
14:54 - so this is just a function and it should
14:57 - return a P vector not be void that just
14:59 - gives me the center of the blob whenever
15:01 - I want it because what I want is Center
15:07 - B is this particular blobs get centered
15:12 - and then I want Center C be nothing
15:17 - better I'd see much better naming that
15:19 - other blob Center and then I want to
15:21 - look at the distance between those two
15:27 - and if
15:33 - if that distance is less than the record
15:35 - distance then the record distance is
15:38 - that distance and guess what that blob
15:42 - is the current reigning one that I've
15:43 - matched so what I'm going to do here is
15:47 - I also need to say make a variable
15:49 - called matched so and now I'm going to
15:52 - say matched is that particular current
15:54 - blob and at the end what I'm going to do
15:58 - is say the blob dot ID equals and
16:07 - interestingly enough so the blob has
16:09 - changed its size so I also want to like
16:12 - copy all of its stuff over but rather
16:15 - than doing that I wonder if would it
16:20 - work for me to just say this blob is
16:24 - equal to that blob and then it's okay
16:28 - that blobs ID is equal to that blobs ID
16:31 - and then then set let's see this
16:35 - particular app match right right the
16:39 - matched ID is the blobs ID that I just
16:42 - checked and then the and then the blob
16:49 - itself is then equal to matched now I'm
16:52 - a little worried that this is going to
16:53 - be an issue let's see why and I can say
16:57 - no just giving me a little error here so
17:01 - let's think about this so let's think
17:03 - about this algorithm I'm really thinking
17:05 - this through here so let's say okay so I
17:09 - I start with no matched blob then I go
17:13 - through all of my current blobs and oh
17:15 - I'm looping through okay I'm going
17:18 - through all of the existing the
17:20 - pre-existing blobs and I'm finding the
17:23 - one that's closest in the current blobs
17:25 - when I find it I give that matched one
17:28 - that blobs ID and then I set that blob
17:31 - back evil to it so let's just run this
17:36 - for a second
17:37 - and and see what happens now I'm not
17:40 - going to be able to add or delete blobs
17:42 - in this case because I'm only ever doing
17:44 - something when I have
17:46 - no when I have no blobs or the equal
17:49 - number of blobs so I should get let's
17:55 - see what we run nothing yeah that's
17:56 - always a good sign so let's see if blobs
17:59 - is empty go through all the current
18:04 - blobs add them okay
18:07 - so let's let's add some debugging here
18:11 - adding globs
18:13 - let's see if we ever get this oh you
18:15 - know this would be fun to sew blobs
18:22 - should be empty right now
18:23 - oh oh if it's empty and guess what I
18:27 - only want to do this but that should and
18:33 - current blobs dot size is greater than
18:37 - zero like I don't want to do anything if
18:38 - there aren't any current blobs okay
18:41 - let's see here
18:46 - why did I added some blobs ah so you
18:50 - know what I so I think it got some a
18:54 - small blob must have appeared
18:57 - I might have to edit this part out
19:02 - guess what if you would like to see the
19:04 - results of your code in the window it
19:06 - helps to draw the stuff in the window
19:09 - okay so now I'm going to come back here
19:12 - and say for all the blobs for all the
19:16 - blobs in blobs bicho let's add that back
19:24 - in and now so you can see it got my nose
19:31 - as a blob and I can I update it if I
19:36 - just have one blob kind of near it now
19:38 - you would think that this which at least
19:40 - be able to match it with this so let's
19:42 - see if let's see if I can get that to
19:43 - work so one thing that I want to I want
19:45 - to give myself some debugging
19:47 - information on the screen I don't really
19:49 - care about the distance and color
19:51 - threshold right now so what I want to
19:53 - draw is text and I'm going to hold on
20:00 - I'm going to draw some debugging
20:01 - information on the screen hold on ah and
20:12 - I want to draw just say blobs dot size
20:18 - and I want to draw current blobs dot
20:24 - size and make this one a little further
20:26 - down and actually it's F let's have this
20:28 - be below
20:33 - so hopefully that's going to be big
20:35 - enough for me to see it you can't really
20:38 - see it that well let me zoom in whoops
20:39 - ah hold on we make this much bigger
20:50 - sorry everybody
20:52 - here we go let's see what's happening
20:55 - here okay so there's no blobs in either
20:59 - one blob now my matching is not updating
21:03 - okay so you can see that even when it's
21:06 - actually even when it detects one more
21:08 - blob it should match that first blob was
21:11 - detected it should match and follow it
21:13 - because it's the closest flaw so now we
21:14 - need to debug and figure out why that's
21:16 - not working so I knew I didn't really
21:19 - like I didn't really like the way of
21:21 - doing this I think I like I've got a
21:23 - like variable reference issue like I've
21:25 - got this variable that's sitting in the
21:27 - ArrayList but if I assign it I think
21:29 - I've kind of lost it still so I don't
21:31 - think this is going to work what I want
21:33 - to do is write a function I think it's
21:34 - gonna be a much better strategy is to
21:36 - say a blob dot copy matched it's copy
21:44 - the right thing or maybe a follow or
21:47 - become that's right let's call it become
21:49 - so what I want is this particular blob
21:52 - to become the matched blob it keeps its
21:55 - ID but it won't the cameras about to
21:58 - shut off it keeps its ID but it but it
22:04 - then takes on all the characteristics of
22:06 - the blob that its matched so I'm going
22:08 - to do that so I need to write a function
22:09 - called become and it receives another
22:13 - blob so really all I need to do is just
22:15 - say min X I just want to copy and I'm
22:17 - sure we could come up with a more
22:19 - efficient way of doing this but I just
22:22 - want to copy all the properties of one
22:24 - blob to another and since the ID is here
22:31 - in this blob that already exists I don't
22:34 - have to worry about copying the ID so
22:36 - that should work and now let's do this
22:39 - let's see if this fixes that particular
22:41 - problem
22:45 - there we go so you can see whenever it
22:48 - detects it it kind of follows it why is
22:53 - it being so why is the detection
22:55 - suddenly so poor I wonder if like my
22:59 - color calibration is off guess what
23:05 - everybody
23:06 - no wonder my code was performing so
23:07 - strangely I instead of removing the
23:13 - small blobs notice I'm removing them if
23:15 - the size is greater than 500 because
23:17 - before I was only drawing them for the
23:19 - size of greater than 500 so I actually
23:21 - want to delete all the small blobs not
23:23 - the big ones and that's why it was
23:25 - working very very poorly and this should
23:28 - fix that and we can see now I'm matching
23:34 - this blob perfectly but I've but uh I'm
23:38 - actually getting the boat as zero so
23:40 - hold on because I at when I was
23:42 - debugging this I started drawing the
23:44 - current blobs and actually this is
23:45 - useful to do but I'm not going to worry
23:48 - about that right now okay so now let's
23:50 - see what we've got so far
23:52 - now have one blob that is always ID zero
23:58 - but this one is never going to be picked
23:59 - up because I don't have any code for
24:03 - when there are when there are more blobs
24:06 - than when there when there were more
24:10 - blobs than was previously detected so
24:13 - let's go now into the algorithm and
24:15 - let's figure that out so I now have code
24:20 - for if the oh I have to fix some things
24:24 - but that's okay if the blobs are empty
24:27 - and there are current blobs just add
24:29 - them all and now I actually want to
24:31 - change this now I want to do something
24:33 - if there are if the amount of blobs are
24:36 - less than or equal to the current blobs
24:40 - so in this case even if they're less
24:42 - than or equal to I would still oh this
24:44 - is great because I kind of already have
24:46 - the code for this I would match all of
24:48 - the blobs that I can match and then
24:51 - what's ever left over I'm just going to
24:53 - add
24:53 - new blocks but here's the thing
24:55 - something I didn't add to this code is I
24:57 - can't match a blob twice so what if this
25:00 - one is if this current blob gets matched
25:03 - I can't say it's two different blobs at
25:05 - the same time so one thing that I want
25:07 - to do is in my blob I want to create a
25:12 - boolean variable called matched which by
25:15 - definition is set to false and then here
25:20 - if the matched oh I don't like that I
25:28 - call this matched and now I made my
25:29 - boolean variable named match because now
25:31 - I'm in the business of saying match
25:32 - matched equal true so let's think of I'm
25:36 - going to call this taken like it's it's
25:38 - taken it's not taken it's still
25:41 - available to be matched so I'm going to
25:44 - say once it's found its state is taken
25:47 - and if its distance is less than the
25:50 - record distance and that particular blob
25:53 - is not taken then it began it can be
25:59 - matched so in this case only blobs that
26:03 - haven't been matched before can be um
26:07 - can then be matched with a new blob in a
26:09 - new frame so once that's happened right
26:12 - all I need to do is say after all that
26:15 - matching is done so this is like match
26:19 - whatever blobs you can match and now
26:24 - after that whatever is left over make
26:29 - make new blobs so how do I do that I
26:32 - look at all the blobs in current blobs
26:37 - and I say if that blob is not taken if
26:41 - it was not matched then what I do
26:43 - exactly what I did when I was adding new
26:45 - blobs
26:46 - so it's blob whoops ah picture I give it
26:50 - its ID being the counter I add it and
26:52 - then I increase the counter so now if I
26:57 - run this code I'm pretty sure we now
27:00 - have the ability to say here's blob zero
27:05 - here's blob 1
27:08 - mmm I wonder why now the problem is I
27:12 - can never remove them hmm come back why
27:15 - is it one together so this is in fact
27:21 - working the issue is it's going to break
27:24 - you can see how the ideas are staying
27:26 - it's going to completely break once one
27:29 - of the blobs goes away yeah actually it
27:32 - didn't completely break it's doing weird
27:35 - things because I can't ever delete blobs
27:37 - so the blobs can get stuck very easily
27:40 - because I don't have a way oh this is
27:41 - sort of a nice effect right I can always
27:44 - pick them back up again so because I
27:46 - don't have now what you see what's
27:47 - missing is I need a method for saying oh
27:49 - those blobs no longer exist so how do I
27:51 - add that in so I have in my code I'm
27:55 - testing what if it's empty what if there
28:00 - are no hit blobs historically but I
28:02 - found some blobs or what if I have had
28:04 - blobs historically but I either have the
28:07 - same amount of blobs I detected or more
28:09 - and now I need that last scenario else
28:12 - and this is really I could just say else
28:13 - - a else if blobs dot size is greater
28:18 - than current blobs dot size so now
28:24 - here's the thing I'm I really should I'm
28:27 - going to need to refactor this later but
28:29 - just for the sake of argument right now
28:31 - I'm going to copy and paste this exact
28:34 - code okay what I'm going to do is copy
28:38 - and paste this exact code uh because
28:45 - I've got to think about this for a
28:47 - second my brain is working - tick tick
28:49 - tick but basically what I want to do is
28:51 - I want to say let me um let me look at
28:55 - the blobs that I do have and see if I
29:00 - can match them but actually I think what
29:08 - might be an interesting way of doing
29:09 - this I could do it this way but let's
29:11 - keep let's do it this way I'm going to
29:12 - leave it the same I was going to say
29:13 - should maybe do it the other way around
29:14 - like let's look at all the current blobs
29:16 - and find the closest one and then see
29:18 - what blobs are left over
29:20 - hmm could do it that way I can't decide
29:23 - let me see I might have to I want to I
29:25 - want to loop to stay the same so let's
29:27 - do this let's think about this
29:28 - so the first blob I'm going to try to
29:31 - match it with something okay so now the
29:37 - thing is if there are no blobs left to
29:41 - be matched right then match will be no
29:44 - aha as long as matched is not equal to
29:49 - null then that one's matched and that
29:52 - blob should become it
29:54 - however otherwise if matched is no then
30:01 - this is a blob that I need to delete so
30:04 - I'm going to say this particular blob I
30:07 - should remove a mark for deletion I'm
30:14 - going to write some function right I
30:15 - want to delete it and I actually could
30:17 - just remove it right there but um you
30:22 - know this is a little bit of a problem
30:23 - actually I don't want to do this because
30:25 - I'm giving a big advantage to the first
30:29 - blob right I do need to do it the other
30:33 - way around right because what I'm saying
30:34 - is like there let's think about this for
30:36 - a second let's talk this through okay so
30:40 - the scenario is what what I'm currently
30:46 - seeing is one blob this is what the
30:50 - computer vision sees currently but
30:54 - previously historically there were three
30:58 - blobs previous so I can't loop through
31:04 - these blobs I don't want to loop through
31:07 - these blobs and find the closest one
31:11 - because it whichever blob I start with
31:14 - first is always going to find that one
31:15 - is the closest one so what I actually
31:17 - need to do is loop through these blobs
31:20 - and find which one they're closest to
31:21 - and then delete whatever is left over so
31:24 - I really do need to invert the way that
31:25 - that loop works so coming back over here
31:29 - what I want to do is in my outer loop I
31:32 - want to
31:33 - look at current blobs and then I want to
31:37 - again have a matched one and then I want
31:42 - to look through the blobs historically
31:44 - and then do the same sort of thing here
31:49 - I want to match now this is confusing
31:54 - I'm matching it sort of the other way
31:56 - around
31:57 - I'm looking at all the current blobs and
32:00 - matching up this kind of blob and right
32:11 - so I'm trying to find the one that's
32:14 - matched and then if match does not know
32:18 - that's taken and matched becomes the
32:28 - current blob right because that is the
32:30 - outer loop okay so I'm inverting what
32:32 - I'm doing I'm doing exactly we did
32:34 - before but just the other way around
32:37 - now at some point then oh yeah and so
32:41 - this is actually quite quite nice
32:43 - because then what I can do I don't have
32:47 - to do this mark for deletion thing I'm
32:49 - going to do exactly the same thing where
32:52 - whatever is left over right after I do
32:56 - this whatever blobs are not matched and
33:01 - in this case I'm actually going to blobs
33:05 - dot size minus one I'm going to loop
33:09 - through the loop backwards again is
33:11 - greater than equals 0 I - - I'm going to
33:16 - say into I equals I'm going to I want to
33:21 - delete these blobs so I want to say if
33:25 - if blobs dot get I okay so hold on blob
33:32 - B equals blobs dot get high ha I don't
33:38 - know I understand we're really going to
33:39 - watch this video then I want to say
33:41 - blobs dot remove I only if
33:46 - if B is if B was not taken now there's a
33:51 - little bit of an issue here in this case
33:54 - earlier when I was saying if a blob
33:57 - wasn't taken make a new blob out of it I
34:00 - could guarantee that blobs that worth
34:04 - taken will have the value taken as false
34:06 - the problem here is I'm not a hundred
34:09 - percent sure that's going to be the case
34:11 - because remember these are blob these
34:14 - blobs and this particular rate persist
34:16 - over time so I think something I need to
34:18 - make sure I do here which is a little
34:20 - bit awkward is I need to was I'm going
34:25 - through this I want to just quickly make
34:27 - sure taken is set to false so that when
34:30 - I get to the end of this loop and a set
34:32 - taken to true only the one that really
34:34 - was taken get set to true though that's
34:36 - a problem I don't want to do it here I
34:38 - need to do it once I can't do it there I
34:40 - want to do it once just really quickly
34:42 - at the very very beginning I'm sure
34:44 - somebody watching this video
34:48 - I just before we do anything so I think
34:52 - I'm just as a safety measure if I have
34:55 - more blobs historically than what I'm
34:58 - currently seeing then none of them are
35:01 - taken any of them could get matched and
35:03 - then whatever's left over gets deleted
35:05 - okay now let's see what happens I can't
35:12 - imagine that I've gotten everything
35:14 - right here but we can see if I did okay
35:22 - so there are no blobs currently and
35:24 - there are no blobs historically I'm
35:26 - going to move this up like this
35:27 - now there is one blob currently and
35:31 - there is one blob historically there are
35:33 - two blobs currently and there are two
35:35 - blob store now here comes the magic
35:36 - thing take it away
35:38 - look at that three four five
35:48 - okay I'm gonna put blob number five on
35:50 - my head oh this is now blob number six
35:53 - this is blob number nine cuz we had some
35:56 - small ones whoops combined that's now
35:58 - blob number ten and you can see they are
36:00 - keeping their ids you know obviously
36:02 - little things are going to go wrong if
36:04 - the blob disappears this is a balancing
36:07 - act but you can see this is actually
36:09 - working so we did actually so now this
36:12 - works I can't believe it I need a I need
36:14 - the whatever the opposite sound effect
36:17 - of this is is what I need right now for
36:21 - that having worked like shockingly now
36:23 - interesting enough why is there still
36:25 - seeing a blob there that's weird
36:28 - it's not seeing any blobs currently but
36:30 - there is one blob historically so if I
36:33 - bring this in that's going to be blob
36:34 - number 15 it's always leaving one blob
36:37 - leftover so that's a bug I need to fix
36:39 - that shouldn't be the case let's see if
36:41 - we can fix that and there's some other
36:43 - stuff I want to add to this but I think
36:45 - I might do that in a separate video um
36:48 - okay so why if oh you know what it is
36:57 - I have I know what the problem is let's
37:02 - look at what I missed
37:02 - okay if there's empty and there are
37:05 - actually blobs this is right if the if
37:07 - they're equal or there's more do this
37:09 - but guess what what if both of these are
37:12 - 0 yeah yeah no that should okay what's
37:16 - happened what the issue is when there's
37:17 - one one in the ArrayList but zero in
37:22 - this shouldn't that happen here there
37:26 - are more blob let so hold on I'm going
37:29 - to print a option three all right let's
37:33 - just make sure that's happening in this
37:36 - case that I'm worrying about
37:41 - what are we timewise 12 2001 0 0 0 leave
37:49 - so we should be seeing and right now
37:52 - option 3 option 3 option 3 so
37:54 - something's not working in option 3 if
37:56 - for some reason I'm not detecting any
37:59 - current blobs this one I need better Sun
38:06 - this loop is in the wrong place and it
38:10 - wasn't being checked because it was
38:11 - inside of the loop of looking through
38:13 - the curve blobs and there are none so
38:15 - that was just my problem there so now we
38:17 - should have this fixed and we should
38:21 - have blobs over time oh so I already
38:26 - found a bunch of blobs you can see here
38:29 - that these blobs are keeping their ID no
38:31 - matter the real test is like kind of
38:33 - going around in a circle because I know
38:36 - that they're changing the order that
38:37 - they're being found I it's finding
38:39 - multiple blobs so you could see they you
38:41 - know 26 27 28 29 so here's the thing do
38:49 - you notice how those numbers are getting
38:50 - pretty high very very quickly I'm not
38:52 - going to do this in this video I but I
38:54 - am going to do I'm going to make a
38:55 - separate video to do an improvement on
38:57 - this which one thing that I might say
39:00 - I'm going to leave this and type I'm not
39:01 - know if I'm going to get to this today
39:02 - it might be a while before this video
39:04 - comes out so I'm gonna leave this as an
39:05 - exercise here's what I would do next I
39:08 - should just do this today I'm gonna do
39:09 - this today but not in this video I
39:11 - believe this is an exercise anyway if
39:12 - you're watching this what I would make
39:15 - sense to do is to add some sort of timer
39:18 - in here so what if each blob had a timer
39:21 - and I don't actually delete it like I
39:24 - leave it on the screen for a little
39:26 - while so for another what if just the
39:28 - computer vision algorithm like flicks
39:30 - off for a second it would really like
39:31 - delete that blob and make a new one but
39:33 - if jitter is like a flash of light or
39:35 - something changed really slightly I turn
39:36 - the blob I want it to only be deleted if
39:39 - it really really times out like if it's
39:41 - if it's not been detected for at least
39:43 - one second or two seconds or half a
39:46 - second so this is an improvement that I
39:47 - would suggest you giving a try yourself
39:49 - but I'm going to do it in a video for
39:51 - you so if you can't figure out how to do
39:53 - it you'll be able to watch the next
39:55 - yo in which I will do okay thanks for
39:57 - watching I don't know if this came
39:59 - together or not
40:00 - but this is a video that shows you how
40:02 - to do persistence I don't know why I'm
40:04 - recapping what was in the video because
40:05 - I'm just done right now you should stop
40:06 - go outside and enjoy yourself and get
40:10 - away for the computer for a little while
40:12 - that's what I suggest okay thanks for
40:13 - watching I look for the code it'll be in
40:15 - it'll be in the description of this
40:16 - video you can find it and play with it
40:18 - yourself okay bye bye thank you
