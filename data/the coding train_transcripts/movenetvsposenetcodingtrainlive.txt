05:01 - but it's not working just yet hold on
05:05 - ah i don't have enough time please give
05:08 - me some time

08:06 - hello good morning happy friday
08:10 - on the coding train it is me dan your
08:12 - host
08:13 - coming to you live from an attic in
08:16 - brooklyn
08:18 - um i'm a little bit discombobulated i
08:20 - suppose that's what i say
08:21 - every time i live stream um but i was
08:24 - attempting
08:25 - to get this um live poll
08:28 - thing working um
08:31 - and i must be missing
08:35 - something um because
08:40 - it didn't work the way i expected it to
08:43 - i don't know if this is how i should
08:45 - open
08:48 - but everything is all all awry
08:51 - here let me start over
09:10 - hello happy friday welcome to the coding
09:14 - train
09:15 - it is me dan your host coming to you
09:17 - live from an attic in brooklyn maybe
09:18 - this is the first time you're watching
09:20 - the coding train live
09:21 - if you are if it is welcome thank you
09:25 - for joining
09:26 - um i am a very disorganized person who
09:30 - just like throws this stuff together at
09:31 - the last minute so
09:33 - please be kind be generous
09:37 - talk amongst yourselves in the chat
09:38 - thank you to marek for a very kind
09:41 - super chat that just came in much
09:44 - appreciated
09:45 - um i have a list of topics to get to
09:48 - today
09:49 - i also would like to just sort of give
09:51 - you the latest in coding train news
09:53 - update you on my schedule tell you a
09:55 - little bit about what videos are coming
09:57 - out
09:57 - in the future um and just sort of hang
10:00 - out here for
10:01 - uh i am not wearing a watch but um hang
10:04 - out for like one two three four
10:05 - five hairs and a freckle about that no
10:08 - time i expect i'll be done
10:10 - at around 12 30 p.m eastern let me say
10:13 - hello to a few folks in the chat
10:15 - hello to fox the bomb and coder prith
10:18 - and marek
10:19 - and victor um and
10:22 - all that this is kind of amazing marek
10:24 - said he said my name
10:26 - but somehow i don't understand how you
10:28 - possibly there's usually like at least
10:30 - a 30 second to one minute delay but
10:35 - in any case oh let me also uh before i
10:37 - forget
10:38 - um um thank uh one of today's or the
10:42 - today's the sponsor there's only one
10:44 - sponsor folks
10:45 - and that is brilliant um i personally
10:49 - like to learn my maths from my geometry
10:53 - mug over here uh which everybody should
10:55 - have their own geometry mug this by the
10:57 - way was purchased in bletchley park
11:00 - if you've ever been to bletchley park
11:01 - one of my favorite trips i ever had the
11:02 - chance to go on
11:03 - uh i was in the uk for a little while
11:05 - and i actually went to blessing park
11:06 - twice
11:07 - or three times i loved it so much but um
11:10 - another way that you can learn
11:12 - um is um by watching me on youtube
11:16 - [Music]
11:18 - you know your mileage may vary with that
11:20 - strategy but
11:21 - i can tell you that a very productive
11:23 - and positive way to learn
11:25 - is through interactive lessons where you
11:26 - get to try stuff out on your own
11:29 - supported by a community of other folks
11:31 - who are interested and brilliant is a
11:32 - place where you can do that
11:34 - i've been following the geometry
11:36 - fundamentals course that's on brilliant
11:37 - i'll come back and
11:38 - halfway through and try to do the next
11:40 - exercise that i have not looked at yet
11:42 - since last time i live streamed
11:44 - so i'm excited to try to do that you can
11:45 - sign up for free at brilliant.org
11:47 - codingtrain um and you could if you know
11:50 - if you want to unlock
11:51 - all of their premium content all their
11:53 - courses the first 200 people to do so
11:55 - through that link will get 20
11:56 - off all right
11:59 - so what's happening today uh oh will
12:03 - says in the chat i am sitting here right
12:05 - now only
12:06 - three miles away from bletchley park oh
12:09 - i
12:09 - am jealous i am many many
12:12 - many miles away from fletchley park
12:15 - right now
12:18 - i would love to be able to visit there
12:20 - again i haven't really done any
12:21 - traveling beyond
12:23 - uh places that you can reach by motor
12:25 - vehicle within a few hours from new york
12:27 - city
12:28 - um in over a year so i don't know when
12:30 - my next actual like airplane trip or
12:32 - trip to
12:34 - uh you know across water a giant body of
12:37 - water by a boat might be actually one
12:39 - thing that i did this is
12:40 - a little little little uh tidbit stories
12:43 - from the coding train
12:44 - um i have lived in new york city um
12:47 - since 1995 so about 26 years if i'm
12:50 - doing the math correctly there
12:54 - for the first time ever really i think
12:57 - i mean that i can remember recall at
13:00 - least
13:01 - earlier this week i took a ferry from
13:05 - manhattan to brooklyn because i was
13:07 - running an errand and i was doing some
13:09 - jogging and i was like oh there's a
13:10 - ferry
13:11 - goes here from this pier to this pier
13:14 - and it was
13:14 - absolutely amazing just public
13:17 - transportation not a tourist ferry or
13:19 - anything but i felt like i was on some
13:20 - magical journey
13:22 - so highly recommend that um
13:25 - all right so um let's see are there
13:27 - people here watching
13:29 - you know it was a little bit street what
13:31 - huh i don't know what's going on ah
13:33 - concurrent viewers there we go
13:35 - there are there are there are a fair
13:37 - amount of you here um
13:39 - um anyone hanging out in the discord for
13:41 - the live chat
13:42 - yes me me i'm in the discord
13:45 - i'm in the youtube chat got them all up
13:47 - here on my
13:48 - console so
13:51 - here's the main thing that i want to
13:53 - look at today if
13:54 - all else if i get to nothing else at
13:58 - all the main thing that i want to look
14:00 - at today is something called move net
14:05 - which is here this is
14:09 - a ultra fast and accurate model that
14:12 - detects 17 key points of a body oh hi
14:14 - celeste
14:16 - come over here so i'm fostering an
14:19 - elderly
14:20 - lady cat oh my god she just
14:23 - gave me a very weird little meow can you
14:25 - hear her meow
14:29 - i'm afraid to pick her up she's a little
14:31 - bit sensitive
14:32 - um but we've got we've got a lot of
14:35 - animals going on in this house
14:36 - she's a 13 year old cat whose owners
14:40 - sadly um passed away and she was left
14:43 - all alone in a shelter and quite
14:44 - terrified and so we've taken her in
14:47 - with our other two younger cats and
14:49 - gloria pickle who you may recognize from
14:51 - some of my videos but
14:52 - she seems to like to be up here in the
14:53 - attic she's giant she's a really big
14:56 - cat hi
15:00 - is this not what you signed up for me
15:02 - talking to a cat that you cannot even
15:04 - see
15:05 - you know hold on a second let's make
15:07 - this a little bit more interesting for
15:09 - you all
15:09 - so you know what i'm talking about here
15:11 - can i get this
15:12 - to work um i'm adding
15:16 - a video capture device
15:19 - epocam oh boy
15:23 - that's a bit extreme all right let's see
15:26 - if i can get my
15:27 - phone oh no celeste she's going away
15:30 - don't go
15:31 - celeste don't go i'm just about to try
15:35 - to get you on camera
15:37 - uh connecting to your computer oh
15:41 - there we are there's me all right let's
15:43 - see if we can find you
15:45 - oh why is it it's
15:49 - there we go celeste there's celeste okay
15:52 - everybody
15:53 - come here
15:57 - okay okay
16:01 - celeste a tual is her name
16:05 - a little peek into my attic and my green
16:07 - screen
16:08 - i think i can shut this off now
16:12 - and close that down where were we
16:15 - move net
16:19 - so you might you might remember me from
16:22 - my videos
16:23 - like
16:28 - uh ml5 pose estimation with pose net
16:32 - so posnet is hey
16:36 - posenet is a machine learning model
16:40 - that estimates key points on a body um
16:43 - and it was developed by researchers i
16:46 - believe
16:47 - at google it's one of the models from
16:49 - tensorflow.js
16:50 - and it's always worked quite well i
16:53 - assume
16:54 - if i go to this page here and
16:57 - just click on the web editor version of
17:00 - the code
17:01 - if my website works as it's supposed to
17:07 - um there we go we can see here this is
17:10 - my exam
17:11 - postnet example that i developed for
17:14 - this particular
17:15 - video tutorial now the question is
17:22 - uh is movenet in theory is
17:25 - perhaps a
17:26 - [Music]
17:29 - improvement in theory so from what i
17:32 - hear on posenet
17:34 - and i'm wondering if um it is something
17:38 - that should be added to
17:41 - ml5 as an option so load a pose
17:45 - detection model
17:46 - choose pose net or move net or just
17:48 - simply replace it
17:49 - so i wanted to do a little exploring
17:52 - of this model today so that's kind of my
17:55 - main agenda item
17:58 - i should also mention that if you go to
18:01 - thecodingtrain.com
18:02 - you might notice that a new coding
18:05 - challenge video was released
18:06 - yesterday so for all of you who have
18:09 - been saying
18:11 - over and over again on many of my recent
18:14 - video releases that have been some
18:16 - beginner p5 and some nature of code
18:17 - videos like where are the coding
18:18 - challenges
18:19 - where are the coding challenges i missed
18:21 - the coding challenges
18:22 - here is one so um the question is
18:26 - and i actually haven't looked what's the
18:28 - chance
18:29 - that there are any community
18:30 - contributions to this coding challenge
18:33 - no no you could be the first
18:36 - there have not been made there haven't
18:38 - been made it seems like there haven't
18:40 - been made i think i need to work on
18:42 - some of the copy are you a writer if you
18:45 - are a writer
18:46 - um and would like to contribute i kind
18:49 - of feel like i want to
18:50 - go take a pass over all of my materials
18:53 - and rewrite everything and create kind
18:54 - of a style guide for
18:56 - descriptions and the language that's on
18:57 - the website so reach out to me
18:59 - if you uh have any ideas for how to
19:02 - um create sort of friendly fun welcoming
19:06 - um language little quirky
19:09 - to describe all that i do here on the
19:12 - coding train
19:12 - because not my skill set um but you
19:15 - could add your own community
19:17 - contribution i was hoping i might have
19:18 - some to show
19:19 - let's look at all the the various
19:21 - examples from this um just so you know
19:23 - what you're getting yourself into
19:24 - if you choose to watch this video so
19:27 - this
19:28 - is the core basic example every time i
19:32 - run it
19:32 - it runs a self-avoiding walk
19:35 - which is a random walk which will take a
19:38 - step
19:40 - um to a new spot in this grid but it
19:43 - can't go to a spot it's already been to
19:45 - so um
19:46 - so we can see the results of that here
19:49 - this
19:49 - actually this example is completed
19:51 - within the first
19:52 - 12 minutes of the video it's a 40
19:56 - approximately 40 minute video but this
19:57 - example is completed in the first 12
19:59 - minutes
20:00 - because the next thing that i attempt to
20:02 - do which takes me quite a bit longer
20:05 - is add something known as backtracking
20:07 - so what you'll notice the difference
20:08 - here
20:10 - is
20:14 - what you'll notice the difference here
20:16 - is whenever it gets to a point where it
20:19 - has no
20:20 - other option it backs up and tries to go
20:22 - in different directions
20:23 - one of the things i discovered while
20:25 - recording this video is the
20:27 - you know the possibility space of all of
20:29 - the self-avoiding
20:30 - random walks is so massive
20:34 - that i don't think we could none of us
20:35 - could live long enough
20:37 - who knows if the universe could even
20:38 - last long enough for one of these
20:41 - uh examples to complete um
20:44 - unless it's a very sort of like low
20:46 - resolution space
20:49 - but so i think there's a lot of creative
20:51 - possibilities
20:52 - here um i've explored um in a
20:56 - in a live stream recently taking this
20:58 - idea and putting it into
21:00 - 3d and if you tweak this a little bit
21:02 - you can really start to look like the
21:04 - windows pipes
21:05 - screensaver this is a version i did
21:09 - uh by just changing um
21:13 - what i'm drawing to bezier vertices so
21:16 - it has this sort of like strange
21:18 - almost like alien like uh curve
21:22 - path um instead of just the perfect uh
21:26 - square grid this is actually thanks to
21:30 - uh dusk who does a lot of work uh
21:32 - managing
21:33 - the coding train uh github repos and the
21:37 - different
21:37 - um metadata associated with each video
21:40 - this
21:41 - particular um
21:45 - uh version which uses recursion dust
21:47 - created i i
21:48 - mentioned in the video like oh i should
21:50 - make one with recursion
21:51 - so that's not an example that i've
21:52 - covered or explained but
21:54 - uh you should certainly take a look and
21:56 - join the discord and ask questions if
21:58 - you have it
21:58 - and then this random walk with alpha oh
22:00 - this is just from the very beginning of
22:02 - the video
22:02 - where i was just trying to show how you
22:04 - could create a
22:06 - random walk that visualizes the amount
22:08 - of time
22:09 - amount of times a certain space has been
22:11 - landed on so that's if it
22:13 - weren't self-avoiding um so i i don't
22:16 - know i kind of want to anecdotally
22:17 - get a sense of how many people who watch
22:20 - the live streams
22:22 - who like are watching right now so
22:23 - according to
22:25 - my youtube console here there are 211
22:28 - people that have this
22:29 - page open in their browser that's all it
22:31 - tells it doesn't actually tell me how
22:33 - many people are actually watching
22:36 - but how many of you noticed
22:40 - that a new coding challenge was um was
22:43 - released
22:44 - noticed it and watched some of it versus
22:47 - noticed and watched
22:48 - all of it let's make that a live coding
22:51 - train
22:52 - poll okay create a poll
22:56 - so this system by the way that i'm not
22:58 - sure i don't know if um
23:00 - foxy is watching right now but i i you
23:03 - know i really need to look at this stuff
23:04 - in between live streams and not just
23:07 - like expect it to magically work
23:09 - but foxy who is a viewer has been doing
23:10 - a ton of work
23:12 - and people are now in the chat are
23:13 - telling me i did me i watched but let's
23:15 - see
23:16 - um let's say self avoiding
23:19 - walk no idea
23:23 - it was released saw it was released
23:28 - didn't watch
23:32 - watched part watched
23:35 - all okay so these are the options
23:38 - i'm gonna create this poll so the idea
23:42 - here ah this is what i'm looking for
23:44 - the qr code so you should be able to
23:46 - scan this qr code
23:47 - um and go right to voting um and then
23:51 - this is what will give me the results
23:56 - um and the question is
23:59 - how there should be a view which is
24:02 - called
24:03 - overlay oops no over
24:06 - lay equals true
24:11 - so overlay and look at i love how it's
24:14 - live updating
24:15 - overlay mode
24:19 - yeah monotone simply are font
24:23 - um but i don't there's a view that shows
24:26 - the results
24:27 - and the qr code and i don't remember how
24:30 - to get it
24:32 - let's look in
24:35 - the merged pull request which presumably
24:44 - more green
24:49 - integrates compact compact
24:52 - oh compact view is what i want
24:56 - newest is redirected
25:00 - uh obs redirecting kills the url
25:02 - parameters i see
25:04 - the europarole compact is removed
25:06 - completely also the
25:07 - this is the view i'm looking for oh
25:10 - qr code ah that's the one i need to use
25:14 - okay i have discovered it so let me go
25:17 - back here to camera
25:19 - and go to um
25:23 - the poll and go to
25:26 - properties and go this is the one that i
25:30 - want here
25:30 - qr code so i just forgot what we did
25:34 - and when i say we
25:37 - there's no we about it um
25:41 - so uh transform
25:44 - reset transform there we go oh but it
25:47 - doesn't show the results
25:49 - so i want a page that shows the results
25:52 - and the qr code
25:54 - i want
25:58 - where did i close that out
26:03 - i want this where how do i get
26:07 - this view obs oh incredible fox is there
26:10 - use
26:10 - newest
26:13 - it wasn't did i not bring in the most
26:16 - recent code
26:21 - because okay so if i go here slash
26:24 - newest
26:35 - this is
26:42 - maybe i didn't import the most recent
26:50 - code
26:52 - the idea was to make two obs instances
26:56 - uh sorry incredible fox you're doing an
26:59 - amazing job
27:00 - it's me that has no ability
27:03 - to uh follow and like get this right
27:07 - um it can't show
27:11 - both at the moment ah
27:14 - oh make two got it got it got it got it
27:18 - got it got it got it got it got it
27:20 - okay okay so let's try that now
27:25 - i've got it so this is
27:32 - should be the qr code to the poll
27:41 - so there we go now this is i'm going to
27:44 - rename this to
27:48 - to um
27:54 - rename how do i rename rename qr
27:58 - code okay now
28:03 - i'm going to duplicate this or no i'll
28:05 - just make a new one
28:09 - new browser um
28:13 - call this one pull
28:17 - and now we're going to give this the
28:26 - live pole
28:27 - [Music]
28:29 - newest
28:42 - and
28:46 - uh
28:46 - [Music]
28:50 - my poll slash newest
28:57 - there we go
29:05 - i've done it everybody
29:13 - the qr code should be in front of me oh
29:16 - the pole should
29:17 - both should be in front of me i see it's
29:18 - an overlay that's the idea
29:21 - okay i think
29:26 - and then let's move the qr code up
29:30 - i think we've got it people
29:37 - okay it's done i now have
29:41 - this has been my this is my dream uh
29:44 - apparently don't tell me i should just
29:46 - use streamlabs no i want a custom
29:48 - special coding train only live poll
29:52 - application so
29:55 - 46 percent of you watched the entire
29:58 - coding challenge
30:00 - uh is the scanning not working for
30:02 - people
30:04 - let me try it
30:15 - uh it worked for me i'm gonna say i
30:19 - why i watched all of it because i had to
30:21 - check to make sure there were no like
30:22 - huge mistakes
30:23 - so i'll click watched all and i should
30:26 - get 36 votes as soon as i oh no 37
30:29 - i'm going to press the button 38. i
30:31 - haven't pressed the button i want to see
30:32 - my vote
30:33 - be tabulated 39 there we go
30:36 - okay it worked for me um this is amazing
30:39 - um i don't know why oh i see
30:41 - if you don't have your phone you can't
30:43 - scan it so
30:45 - i don't know what the best solution
30:46 - there is um
30:49 - we could we could probably if um if you
30:52 - just go
30:52 - to um this
30:56 - url live poll live dash poll dash coding
30:58 - train
30:59 - dot glitch dot me um
31:05 - i think you won't see this you have to
31:06 - go to uh newest
31:10 - that's gonna give you the results i
31:12 - don't know
31:14 - how do people get there i guess i could
31:16 - post the link
31:18 - i will post the link to this poll
31:21 - uh for anybody who can't get there so
31:24 - uh go to vote is this url
31:28 - and then if i go to um
31:32 - my actual live stream oh it's already 11
31:34 - o'clock i'm doing great
31:36 - uh and i'm going to the live stream now
31:39 - and i'm going to paste
31:40 - it into the chat there you go that
31:43 - should be the voting link which is now
31:45 - in the chat for you
31:50 - now the question is
31:53 - as soon as i do a new poll
31:56 - will this refresh automatically i'm
31:59 - imagining i have to
32:00 - click away i don't think i have the
32:03 - button checked where it refreshes the
32:05 - page
32:06 - that's an interesting question like do i
32:08 - want it to refresh the page
32:10 - um control audio
32:14 - refresh browser when scene becomes
32:16 - active okay
32:18 - so yes it is doing that what about this
32:20 - page
32:22 - and then now this is the poll properties
32:26 - refresh ah refresh browser okay so now
32:29 - uh if i do whoop
32:33 - it disappeared
32:37 - um okay came back
32:42 - great so the thing that i'm trying to
32:44 - test
32:46 - is if i now do a new poll
32:53 - and i'm gonna go back to here
32:57 - and i'm going to create a poll
33:03 - and next up
33:06 - so now we're going to everyone's going
33:07 - to vote on what i'm going to do next
33:11 - community contributions
33:15 - read random numbers just
33:18 - get to coding with movenet okay
33:21 - so these are the three options and by
33:23 - the way i'm
33:24 - famously i never follow what people vote
33:27 - for so don't get your hopes up
33:29 - but it's this is a useful experiment so
33:31 - now if i create this poll
33:34 - uh and then a celeste is back and then i
33:36 - go back to here
33:39 - it should refresh
33:44 - no
33:49 - why is it not refreshing
33:53 - newest is like the cat is it
33:57 - cashing something
34:00 - refresh cash
34:05 - um let's go to here
34:09 - newest
34:18 - hmm it's showing up as newest when i
34:21 - look here
34:29 - oh this is sad no reading the random
34:32 - numbers and community contributions
34:33 - that's
34:34 - what brings us all together
34:39 - i'm not sure why why won't it why won't
34:42 - it refresh here
34:46 - the qr code refreshed but the poll
34:49 - didn't
34:58 - i can't get it to refresh oh obs
35:01 - your cruel cruel cruel
35:05 - um shut down
35:09 - source when not visible
35:16 - community contributions where we all
35:18 - send you pictures of our cats is a great
35:21 - idea
35:23 - well here's the results of the poll
35:29 - i know but i have a link uh you know
35:32 - what though oh
35:34 - i think obs it's a redirect i think we
35:38 - need to not make it a redirect
35:40 - so i think it just can't be a redirect
35:42 - it has to be its own
35:43 - view uh that pulls
35:47 - um i think that's probably the issue obs
35:50 - probably can't deal with the fact that
35:52 - it's a redirect and it's sort of caching
35:54 - its redirect
35:55 - even though i've cleared the cache and
35:56 - all of that because the qr code
35:59 - obviously is not doing that and that's
36:01 - why it is has updated
36:03 - so i think we'll have to change it to
36:05 - not be a redirect
36:10 - so for now what i'm going to do is
36:18 - um one of these days
36:24 - gonna be a very old man when this
36:27 - live pole thing actually works the way
36:30 - uh
36:30 - intended okay overlay mode okay so i can
36:34 - do
36:34 - this uh
36:40 - overlay equals true
36:43 - there we go so i can force it
36:48 - by putting it here
36:51 - there we go so
36:54 - by the way though if you add up
36:56 - community contributions and read random
36:59 - numbers
37:01 - if you add those up
37:05 - there's more votes than just get to
37:08 - coding
37:10 - with movement so really
37:13 - those two should be in a runoff
37:16 - although i suppose community
37:19 - contributions is getting up there
37:23 - it's not too far
37:30 - not too far am i reading the chat asks
37:33 - rainbow skeppy i don't need overlay
37:36 - equals true
37:37 - according to incredible fox does it
37:38 - detect that it's like an obs
37:40 - browser maybe that's a new feature that
37:43 - was also added
37:45 - so by the way so the history of this
37:47 - project was um
37:48 - that i started actually making it during
37:50 - a live stream in a very sort of
37:52 - simplistic and basic way
37:54 - um and a bunch of different people have
37:56 - made various contributions but
37:58 - incredible fox who is in the youtube
38:01 - chat right now
38:02 - um came in just swooped in and added
38:05 - like a ton
38:07 - of really critical features as well as
38:09 - of this particular design
38:11 - that it currently is i really love um
38:13 - and so
38:14 - um yeah right so everything
38:18 - everyone's just here waiting i'm just
38:19 - here waiting for community contributions
38:22 - to
38:22 - overtake uh movement the thing is i
38:25 - would
38:26 - my plan was to show community
38:28 - contributions from
38:30 - uh the self-avoiding walk
38:34 - but there are none i
38:37 - am sad like a
38:40 - sad trombone oh you can't see what i'm
38:42 - looking at
38:43 - uh this was my plan all along community
38:46 - contributions from the latest coding
38:48 - challenge because of course
38:49 - i release a coding challenge video and
38:52 - millions of viewers around the world
38:53 - watch it
38:54 - immediately make their own artistic
38:56 - creative version of it nope
38:58 - someday that might happen but it takes a
39:00 - little longer and um
39:04 - this is a pretty tricky one um let's
39:07 - look by the way and see um what
39:12 - if i go to the coding train website
39:15 - github repo
39:17 - let's look at pull requests and let's
39:20 - see
39:20 - what is the most recent i'm going to go
39:22 - to closed
39:24 - community contribution looks like the
39:26 - most recent one
39:28 - uh was a contribution by
39:31 - rosa marco on menger sponge
39:35 - so today we will choose to look at
39:39 - the community contributions based on
39:43 - oh and this was by the way coding
39:45 - challenge number two in 2016.
39:49 - the mentor sponge let's go to the
39:52 - challenge
39:53 - uh and marco rosa
39:56 - menger sponge in opengl let's take a
39:59 - look at this
40:01 - it is a github repo
40:04 - uh and it's done in c
40:07 - plus plus with some like raw magic
40:11 - opengl code amazing
40:14 - beautiful looking uh thank you for the
40:18 - shout out in the github repo and this is
40:21 - how to build
40:22 - and run the project let's see if this
40:24 - works what's the chance i could get this
40:26 - to work
40:27 - i haven't tried to build like a c plus
40:29 - project does it just work
40:30 - out of the box on my mac
40:34 - uh presumably i would need to have the
40:37 - sort of xcode developer tools installed
40:41 - but let's see let's see if we can get
40:42 - this to run
40:44 - this will be fun
40:49 - so i'm going to clone this repo first by
40:51 - saying git
40:52 - clone and then just paste in the
40:56 - path to the repository oops i actually i
40:59 - really should have thought about where i
41:01 - was doing this
41:02 - because i always make this mistake i'm
41:04 - just in
41:05 - users coding train the sort of like root
41:08 - user directory of my computer
41:10 - and uh i generally oh look at this
41:13 - community contributions overcame
41:16 - i have i have influence still um
41:19 - so i'm gonna delete this actually
41:22 - by the way this is so funny i'm looking
41:24 - at my
41:25 - um computer and i have this folder
41:28 - called
41:28 - just in case underscore get
41:32 - what do you imagine i have in that
41:34 - directory
41:36 - i'm pretty sure it's some project that i
41:40 - was just completely having some kind of
41:42 - get
41:42 - slash github disaster and decided i
41:45 - needed to start over and i just like
41:47 - threw my directory
41:49 - in here and just called it just in case
41:51 - get like if i needed to go back to it
41:53 - but i couldn't get anything to work oh
41:55 - that happens a lot
41:57 - that happens a lot people oh i wanted to
41:59 - show one other thing um before i get to
42:03 - okay i'm thinking of things now that i
42:04 - wanted to look at so let me go to the
42:06 - desktop
42:08 - let me clone the repo again
42:13 - here it comes let's go into the repo
42:18 - and let's see here c make
42:21 - dash s period dash b
42:24 - build okay so i don't remember any i've
42:27 - done this
42:28 - c make stuff before i don't remember any
42:31 - of it
42:31 - i'm the dot presumably uh means you're
42:34 - going to
42:36 - maybe dash s is like the directory you
42:38 - want to look for your
42:40 - things you want to build and then dash b
42:42 - is where you want to put the stuff that
42:44 - you're going to build
42:44 - so i want to look in my immediate
42:46 - directory dot and then
42:48 - look in and then build it to the build
42:50 - directory
42:56 - okay uh so let's see yes let's let's uh
43:00 - do what we all do which is take this
43:02 - error message
43:03 - you know i'm gonna leave the specific uh
43:06 - shell that i'm using in it
43:07 - uh zsh just in case there's some
43:11 - uh let's see um let's let's look uh mac
43:16 - uh how do i uh install
43:20 - cmake on my mac i guess i could brew
43:24 - install it probably uh mac
43:27 - install cmake
43:30 - okay unix linux
43:35 - mac os there are pre-compiled binaries
43:38 - available on the download page
43:42 - for matt as the after copying cmake.app
43:45 - into applications
43:46 - run it and follow how to install for
43:48 - command line use menu for instructions
43:50 - to make the command line
43:52 - tools available in the path
43:58 - it's not just part of xcode developer
44:00 - tools all right fine let's
44:02 - let's go down this rabbit hole this is
44:04 - definitely what i plan to do during
44:06 - today's live stream
44:07 - you can either download binaries or
44:09 - source code archives
44:13 - okay latest release
44:18 - [Music]
44:19 - mac 10.13 or later that sounds right
44:24 - let's try this
44:27 - ladies and gentlemen we are installing
44:30 - brew install cmake all right
44:32 - good idea let's try that
44:37 - i just take suggestions from the chat
44:39 - what could possibly go wrong oh no
44:42 - oh no oh no
44:47 - oh no
44:51 - okay i don't follow these directions
44:59 - all right why not
45:03 - looks good to me what could possibly go
45:05 - wrong
45:14 - [Laughter]
45:17 - no i'm not going to put in sudo
45:19 - permission denied
45:23 - oh wait no something's working
45:30 - this looks promising by the way should i
45:32 - be updating my mac os
45:36 - the profimesh is very upset with me
45:42 - uh i think that worked i thought you're
45:44 - never supposed to run brew with sudo
45:47 - maybe that was something else somebody
45:48 - once told me that
45:55 - don't be like me kids i have a bad
45:58 - example
46:01 - uh all right
46:04 - here we go let's try this now oh this is
46:07 - promising oh look at this
46:11 - build files have been written oh my god
46:13 - okay
46:14 - what's next oh where's this project okay
46:19 - cd build
46:22 - now i have to type in make okay
46:28 - oh this is exciting i'm building a c
46:31 - project
46:32 - i'm like a real computer person now
46:40 - i'm being told prophet mesh who i trust
46:42 - dearly
46:43 - uh is telling me to and simon of course
46:46 - who is uh
46:48 - um always giving me excellent advice
46:50 - both of them are telling me to update
46:52 - um so i think i will probably not during
46:54 - this live stream
46:56 - mergers by the way i believe it's menger
46:58 - sponge is that correct
47:00 - am i confused men just at least that's
47:03 - what i called it
47:06 - there's a couple different merger sponge
47:08 - menger sponge here's a merger sponge i
47:10 - guess it's an easy typo to make
47:12 - all right let's try to run this wow
47:16 - oh my goodness this is amazing
47:21 - can i make it full screen whoa
47:27 - okay uh oh i've now crashed my computer
47:30 - for sure
47:30 - oh wow so look by the way let's let's
47:33 - compare
47:34 - the performance of
47:38 - opengl native opengl on this particular
47:42 - mac
47:42 - versus p5.js webgl so
47:46 - presumably um i think i click the mouse
47:50 - so let's count one we're good we're good
47:52 - with one
47:53 - two we're good with two
47:57 - three oh see three
48:00 - we are already like lost our frame rate
48:07 - exiting potential infinite loop
48:10 - so we couldn't even get to three with uh
48:13 - webgl with p5.js now let's try running
48:18 - this
48:20 - uh one two
48:23 - three no problem at three
48:26 - four ah even going well at four
48:31 - five i think is where we hit crashing
48:36 - yeah it's actually pretty impressive
48:38 - that it's able to render something
48:41 - i don't recall i think i originally did
48:42 - this in processing
48:44 - so we can actually download the original
48:47 - processing code
48:50 - oh i have something exciting to report
48:54 - i'm just like everything is just a
48:57 - random
48:58 - tangent or digression on the coding
48:59 - train live stream um i guess you
49:03 - all of you are having trouble seeing
49:04 - this with um
49:08 - um the um
49:13 - what you may call it the youtube
49:14 - compression okay here is my processing
49:17 - uh p3d version of it so this is using i
49:20 - believe joggle or java's implementation
49:22 - of opengl
49:23 - okay let's try this uh one
49:27 - two three
49:31 - now can we get to four we got to four
49:33 - with
49:34 - yeah so look at this it's really
49:37 - interesting to see
49:38 - the major difference uh so
49:42 - javascript being the slowest at uh in
49:45 - terms of being able to render the
49:46 - recursion
49:48 - processing java being the
49:52 - let me do it a different way
49:55 - javascript was great it was great
49:58 - the way it rendered that measure sponge
50:01 - processing is like oh
50:03 - awesome the way it rendered that sponge
50:05 - and then
50:07 - c plus plus transcends the medium just
50:10 - like
50:11 - incredible so they're all wonderful but
50:14 - just uh and
50:15 - and speed isn't the only value here in
50:17 - our programming journey
50:19 - but hardware um so the browser is making
50:22 - use
50:22 - of the computer's hardware in the sense
50:25 - that it is using the graphics card if
50:26 - it's rendering with
50:28 - webgl but still lots of other things
50:30 - that are slow let's take a look at our
50:33 - poll
50:36 - and as requested oh my goodness
50:39 - the random number so we looked at that
50:41 - was looking at a community contribution
50:43 - uh the random numbers are
50:47 - um
50:52 - i'm sorry i'm looking at reading some of
50:54 - the random numbers if one more person
50:55 - would just vote for the random numbers i
50:57 - could read random numbers
51:07 - i guess it could be me i could push this
51:09 - over the edge
51:20 - vote yeah
51:22 - [Laughter]
51:24 - it is time everyone for um
51:27 - the i need a random number song i guess
51:30 - the closest i have is this
51:32 - so this is random this is noise pearly
51:34 - noise that is
51:35 - in the core random algorithm the actual
51:38 - random algorithm itself
51:39 - those numbers aren't related at all you
51:42 - pick like
51:43 - i'm picking random numbers between 0 and
51:44 - 10. 9 2
51:46 - 7 6 1 9 four
51:49 - eight nine two one three i picked nine a
51:52 - lot apparently
51:53 - but with pearl and noise i might pick
51:54 - numbers like this
51:56 - two three four three four five six five
51:59 - all right folks
52:02 - here we are um now if you recall
52:06 - i have a new system couple things let me
52:08 - let me tell you a little bit about the
52:09 - discord
52:10 - because uh a goal of mine for this
52:13 - summer is to
52:14 - use the coding train discord more um to
52:17 - have a
52:18 - coding train discord that's uh accepted
52:20 - into the
52:21 - partner program with discord and one of
52:23 - the things the reasons why
52:25 - i can't apply to the partnership
52:28 - with discord is the my audience
52:31 - retention
52:32 - rate is below the 20 meaning
52:36 - uh let's say in the last month there
52:37 - were 500 people who just
52:39 - joined less than 50 of those are
52:42 - 100 of those people sorry 20 um
52:46 - come back fewer than 100 of the people
52:48 - who join
52:49 - come back like a week later to post or
52:51 - check something
52:52 - so i want to do more activities um
52:55 - try to do some q a stuff and different
52:57 - things in the discord to sort of
52:59 - liven up that community one thing you
53:01 - should be aware of is if you
53:02 - join the discord uh first um
53:06 - you'll need to read uh the code of
53:08 - conduct and emoji react to that
53:10 - um maybe we'll switch that over i know
53:12 - there's some new onboarding stuff that
53:13 - discord has
53:15 - i don't know where we are actually but
53:17 - if you i don't use the at
53:19 - everyone uh notification on discord
53:22 - unless absolutely uh necessary
53:26 - those first like really important
53:28 - announcements are sort of
53:29 - emergencies related to spam or some type
53:32 - of other issue
53:33 - um so instead i will notify everyone
53:37 - by um tagging at notifications
53:42 - but you do not if you enter the discord
53:44 - you do not have that
53:45 - role automatically so to subscribe to
53:48 - that role
53:49 - exclamation point subscribe
53:52 - exclamation point subscribe will it's
53:55 - going to remove
53:56 - it for me you can see um that's the bot
53:58 - command is
53:59 - that will also remove that role if you
54:01 - don't want to get the notifications
54:02 - which is very reasonable as well um but
54:05 - that's what i use
54:06 - if i go here under um
54:09 - like schedule um if you know i'm gonna
54:12 - do a new live stream you can see i will
54:14 - tag it with at notifications
54:16 - if there's gonna be a new video coming
54:17 - out or a new thumbnail
54:19 - um also under um
54:22 - i don't know where there's other places
54:24 - you know where i will use that
54:26 - um um yeah and so you'll want to go to
54:29 - the cafe under bot talk
54:33 - so um you can do that do that command in
54:36 - the cafe
54:36 - under the bot talk um so that's
54:40 - my main discord announcement for today
54:44 - there were some other things i thought
54:46 - about um ah
54:48 - so this couple other pieces of coding
54:50 - trade news
54:51 - one is
54:55 - uh i do finally have uh in the channel
54:59 - if i go here under videos and go to this
55:02 - self-avoiding walk
55:04 - there's a little spot in here where like
55:06 - i google
55:07 - um how to how to clone an array in
55:10 - javascript
55:12 - how to copy an array
55:18 - um so one of the things that um i have
55:21 - is now this is in beta or whatever is
55:23 - this clip functionality
55:25 - so if i wanted to i could click clip and
55:27 - then i could say
55:29 - googling searching
55:32 - how to copy an array and then
55:36 - let's just see here uh
55:40 - and then i don't know how do i get the
55:44 - i guess i have to then clip it out like
55:46 - where i want it to
55:53 - oh i want longer than that
56:07 - and then i just want the beginning of
56:08 - how do i copy an array
56:11 - so now if i share this clip
56:17 - how to copy an array in javascript
56:22 - share clip it gives me this
56:26 - link i guess to just that particular
56:28 - clip
56:30 - so i'm just mentioning this because
56:32 - especially with these long live streams
56:34 - and other videos that are very long if
56:36 - you wanted to find a little clip that
56:38 - you love and share it with me or share
56:39 - it with somebody else
56:40 - you could do that i should be able to
56:43 - now
56:44 - just go and paste this into the
56:47 - chat right here
56:50 - uh right here uh so now you should be
56:53 - able to get that
56:54 - clip so i wanted to mention that because
56:56 - i want to encourage people to use it
56:59 - in case it provides any value or fun or
57:01 - a usefulness in terms of
57:03 - sharing stuff um there we go okay i
57:05 - wanted to mention that the other thing i
57:07 - wanted to mention
57:08 - i was looking at a particular youtube
57:11 - channel called
57:12 - free code camp so let's take a look
57:17 - they are a non-profit and they have many
57:20 - uh technical courses and one thing i was
57:23 - noticing was this
57:26 - eight hours three minutes and 17 seconds
57:32 - data structures in eight hours python in
57:35 - four hours four hours 26 minutes and 52
57:40 - seconds i on the coding train
57:43 - the aforementioned coding train youtube
57:45 - channel
57:47 - have been creating content in a
57:49 - different way
57:51 - here is my you know learn to program
57:53 - with p5.js
57:55 - one two three four you know if i go here
57:58 - to
57:58 - this is hopefully the playlist right
58:01 - here's all of the videos
58:03 - you know this is probably four hours
58:06 - five hours six hours but they're all
58:08 - separate videos and i do think that does
58:10 - have some value
58:11 - um having this be sequenced i use it in
58:14 - curriculum to
58:15 - you know as kind of like chapters watch
58:17 - these than this but
58:18 - i'm i'm kind of amazed by how
58:22 - uh hearing about how these are used
58:24 - first of all this python one is
58:26 - 24 million views which is quite
58:27 - incredible
58:29 - so um
58:30 - [Music]
58:32 - i was thinking this august is the 20th
58:36 - anniversary
58:37 - of processing the processing project
58:40 - created by casey reese and ben frye the
58:42 - first version zero zero zero zero zero
58:44 - zero one was released
58:46 - in august 2001 and if you go to
58:50 - um i guess actually let's go to here
58:53 - this is my website is how i
58:55 - try to keep the videos organized if i go
58:57 - here to processing
58:59 - this particular video which is my this
59:02 - is my
59:02 - series of learn uh
59:06 - to code in processing uh separate videos
59:09 - these were
59:09 - these were recorded in 2015 quite low
59:12 - production
59:13 - quality compared to what i'm doing these
59:15 - days i have
59:17 - much less gray hair oh and it looks like
59:19 - my muscles are maybe a little bit bigger
59:20 - but i working out then yes that's uh
59:22 - obviously the picture this is like
59:26 - a picture of working out is right there
59:28 - yeah sure
59:29 - um but um
59:32 - um i was thinking of rebooting these but
59:34 - instead of like
59:35 - recording them as and editing them
59:37 - together as like a whole sequence what
59:39 - if i just took a day
59:41 - and just recorded like everything from
59:43 - start to finish of like
59:45 - everything you need to know about coding
59:46 - and processing and release it as one
59:48 - video
59:49 - i don't think i'll do it as a live
59:50 - stream i think i would still
59:52 - do it as um
59:56 - i'll record it and it'll have some light
59:58 - editing into it because i want to take
59:59 - breaks and things like that
60:01 - but have the video be so that's what i'm
60:03 - thinking about doing sometime this
60:05 - summer will take up a lot of time and
60:06 - energy
60:07 - curious to if you have any feedback or
60:09 - thoughts on that i'm curious to try
60:11 - a course that's just instead of sequence
60:14 - videos one
60:15 - long video and ideally youtube would
60:18 - have some a nice interface for
60:19 - you know you can time code it for being
60:21 - able to move throughout it please do
60:23 - python
60:23 - says rainbow skippy unlikely look you
60:26 - can uh
60:28 - you can go to free code camp you don't
60:30 - need me for python
60:33 - all right oh i wasted enough time that
60:36 - i've gotten to the break yet
60:37 - i think i have so i come back from after
60:40 - the break i'm going to look at movenet
60:44 - it took me an hour to get here um can we
60:47 - have all the courses in a playlist
60:49 - format so this is by the way
60:50 - you know this is the bane of my
60:52 - existence
60:55 - i don't youtube works really
60:58 - has uh really powerful discoverability
61:01 - tools
61:02 - their discoverability tools are mostly
61:05 - search
61:06 - like presumably i would assume if i
61:10 - look for self-avoiding random walk
61:14 - i'm number three here so we can see
61:17 - there are two
61:17 - other uh videos and here's mine
61:21 - on the homepage so it works really well
61:23 - and a lot of people find my videos
61:24 - through search
61:26 - um i think it's more likely people are
61:28 - finding them through search with
61:29 - looking for things like you know
61:31 - javascript promises
61:35 - and there we go number two here um
61:39 - so you can see that's how most people
61:41 - find my videos otherwise it's also
61:43 - recommendations and you could see if i
61:45 - go to the home this is
61:46 - a very dangerous thing for me to do but
61:49 - this is for whatever reason
61:51 - what um what youtube is recommending to
61:53 - me
61:54 - it kind of makes sense some netflix and
61:56 - some linear algebra
61:57 - and coder coder which is a really really
62:00 - awesome
62:00 - uh youtube channel that i've been
62:02 - checking out recently so
62:04 - mostly um that's how uh youtube works it
62:08 - does not um work well
62:11 - for somebody who wants to consume
62:13 - something like
62:14 - a course or a linear sequence of many
62:17 - videos
62:17 - i'm gonna be kind of guided through them
62:20 - uh ayub is saying i can use
62:22 - shorts to increase the visibility of
62:23 - your already existing videos youtube is
62:25 - pushing them now
62:27 - make another channel with 30 second
62:29 - videos for your topics and link them to
62:30 - the videos well i don't know why i would
62:32 - make another channel
62:33 - just put shorts on this channel but one
62:34 - of the things that i definitely do wrong
62:37 - is i do everything in one channel live
62:39 - streams sequence tutorials project
62:41 - videos
62:42 - and it's really amazing to see like when
62:44 - i released
62:45 - a little inside baseball here on youtube
62:48 - when i if i go to uploads just under
62:51 - videos here
62:52 - when i was releasing these videos
62:56 - like 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4
62:59 - youtube was all about like boy if your
63:01 - viewers are watching your videos these
63:03 - days maybe you should consider
63:05 - like looking at the videos that were
63:07 - more popular i'm like no
63:08 - no no no i'm doing what i'm doing it's
63:10 - right i'm doing the right thing
63:12 - these aren't meant for people to watch
63:13 - right now i'm gonna have to release them
63:15 - they're not meant for people to watch
63:16 - right now youtube
63:18 - they're meant for people to watch later
63:20 - when they're coming to do a course on
63:21 - p5.js
63:22 - so please don't count this in your like
63:24 - magic algorithm thing that's deciding
63:26 - whether you should be recommending
63:27 - videos for my channel but i can't
63:29 - there's nothing i can do about that
63:31 - whereas
63:31 - this particular video youtube's like oh
63:34 - hey
63:35 - hey uh your viewers are watching this
63:37 - more than usual they really seem to like
63:39 - you today and by the way it's like
63:41 - this really has an effect on
63:44 - sense of self-worth all these sort of
63:46 - messages and stuff
63:48 - you know um so i think probably if i
63:50 - wanted to
63:52 - build a much larger viewership um
63:55 - having the sort of more popular content
63:57 - on a separate channel that's like
63:58 - dropping on a regular schedule
64:02 - would probably be but i just i can't
64:03 - manage to do that but all of this is to
64:05 - say
64:06 - the canonical resource for finding
64:09 - coding trained videos
64:10 - is the coding trade website i've given
64:12 - up um i'm thrilled
64:14 - to have this youtube platform it's
64:16 - allowed me to
64:17 - earn some income to build this thing up
64:19 - and be able to like
64:20 - have lots of other people who
64:22 - collaborate and work with me on the
64:23 - coding train
64:24 - it's found me an audience that i never
64:26 - could have imagined i would have found
64:30 - but it is not helping me keep my content
64:33 - sort of organized as well as you know
64:34 - there's so much
64:35 - metadata that goes along with any given
64:37 - video of mine
64:38 - such as the code examples the
64:41 - other other challenges and papers and
64:44 - things that i'm referring to
64:45 - so the website is for that now here's
64:47 - the thing there is a
64:49 - somewhat semi-secret project going on
64:52 - right now
64:53 - to completely redo the website by the
64:56 - fall
64:56 - so uh you know it will oh who's to say
65:00 - what it's going to be
65:01 - but it will be hopefully an even better
65:04 - way
65:04 - to browse and find the videos you're
65:06 - looking for understand
65:08 - the sequence of the videos as well as
65:10 - find the code associated with those
65:11 - videos
65:12 - um so anyway i'm sorry
65:16 - i am just going on and on um
65:19 - about all of this and this is this is
65:23 - the way of the coding train these days
65:25 - the live streams are just me rambling
65:27 - talking to the audience hanging out
65:28 - responding to the chat
65:30 - maybe eventually getting to some code
65:32 - which i really will do because i only
65:33 - have
65:34 - less than an hour left and the
65:37 - um the real coding content is coming
65:39 - through uh released videos now
65:41 - uh and just to let you know the next
65:44 - video coming out
65:45 - is uh 5.2 uh i also recorded that bezier
65:49 - curve coding challenge oh
65:51 - just a little so i recorded it yesterday
65:53 - i'll just show you
65:54 - this is like a really really cool
65:56 - example
65:58 - this is the code example from the end
66:01 - of my there's four examples but this is
66:04 - the last example oh this
66:07 - does not let's that was like a bad big
66:09 - like
66:11 - hold on um yeah this is a little bit
66:14 - better
66:15 - this is um this is the example
66:18 - of doing all of the math for bezier
66:20 - curves and drawing these like sort of
66:22 - rainbow string art things so the next
66:25 - coding challenge video
66:27 - uh this is the final result of it
66:28 - recorded it yesterday
66:31 - okay um
66:35 - parmier is asking can we have a complete
66:37 - js course from beginner to advanced with
66:39 - projects
66:40 - so i mean maybe i'm wrong about this
66:43 - but to me that is uh exactly what
66:46 - um this is uh this code
66:50 - program with p5.js course is your start
66:53 - to finish
66:54 - beginner learn to code in javascript
66:57 - with p5.js it's got a very particular
66:59 - point of view
67:00 - in terms of drawing and animation
67:03 - uh you know towards interactive systems
67:06 - generative art data visualization which
67:09 - is different than
67:10 - maybe building full stack web
67:12 - applications or proper
67:14 - web development although if you're
67:15 - interested in that
67:17 - i would suggest this working with data
67:20 - and apis in javascript
67:21 - so if you're looking for more of a start
67:24 - to finish
67:25 - now this you have to have some basic
67:27 - javascript knowledge already
67:28 - to start this particular course but this
67:31 - will give you
67:32 - sort of full stack and i'm not using
67:34 - there is a little bit of p5
67:36 - sprinkled in but it's much more node and
67:40 - uh working with some database stuff and
67:42 - geolocation web api
67:44 - so these um um these i would say are
67:47 - are often the course that people are
67:49 - looking for
67:50 - um yeah so you can see i actually redid
67:53 - my youtube homepage recently
67:55 - so just like there's the coding
67:56 - challenge you know there's the beginner
67:58 - p5
67:58 - the coding challenge videos ml5 machine
68:01 - learning videos
68:02 - which is what i want to cover today
68:04 - nature of code which is what i'm
68:06 - working on still data and apis this i
68:09 - would love to redo this get github one
68:11 - um and then i haven't been able to
68:12 - continue this code in cabana series
68:14 - and then just the uploads down here okay
68:18 - ah now i need to take a break
68:22 - but before i take a break i would like
68:26 - to
68:26 - thank today's sponsor
68:30 - brilliant and i'm just gonna regurgitate
68:33 - a little bit of what i said earlier
68:34 - because it's so true
68:36 - i'm gonna give you three ways that you
68:37 - can learn stuff in order
68:40 - of least productive to most productive
68:45 - i don't know it's really true i have my
68:47 - geometry mug
68:48 - so if ever i'm drinking a little coffee
68:50 - or tea i could always be reminded
68:52 - what is the area of a circle pi r
68:54 - squared
68:55 - but i can't interact with this i can't
68:57 - draw my own circle can't twist a slider
69:00 - i can't do much more other than read the
69:02 - formula be inspired
69:03 - have a nice little sip of coffee
69:07 - i could also watch somebody on youtube
69:10 - that i enjoy
69:13 - three blue one brown is a wonderful
69:14 - youtube channel that i enjoy
69:16 - and i get inspired i fit filled with
69:19 - knowledge
69:20 - um but often i have trouble retaining
69:23 - and maybe i'm that
69:24 - channel for you obviously not today
69:26 - because all i'm doing
69:27 - is just rambling on and on about topics
69:29 - that pop into my mind just in a minute
69:31 - but
69:33 - for me the the most productive and
69:34 - valuable way that i learn is through
69:36 - interactive lessons where i can uh
69:39 - read and watch and see a concept
69:43 - and then try out that concept myself
69:46 - through
69:46 - some kind of interactive mechanism um
69:50 - i can also and also be a part of a
69:51 - community where other people are
69:54 - trying as well and helping each other to
69:55 - learn and that's really what brilliant
69:57 - is for me
69:58 - so they have uh um a wide variety of
70:02 - courses um
70:03 - this you know speaking of which it was
70:04 - just requested like can you do a course
70:06 - on python
70:07 - if you look at the brilliant python
70:09 - course there are
70:11 - uh step-by-step lessons to learn
70:13 - programming with python
70:14 - and a code editor right there in the
70:16 - browser that you can try
70:18 - all of the kind of stuff that i love so
70:21 - much
70:21 - about math and physics and computer
70:24 - science
70:25 - this is the course that i have been
70:26 - going through called geometry
70:29 - fundamentals you can see here is
70:31 - a concept about the pythagorean theorem
70:33 - which is explained and you can also
70:35 - explore in real time through an
70:38 - interactive diagram
70:39 - so um if you want to try out this style
70:42 - of learning and i'm just going to go to
70:44 - the brilliant website myself
70:46 - there's also an app you can sign up for
70:48 - free at brilliant.org
70:50 - codingtrain and
70:53 - you can just get started right now
70:55 - looking through the courses and trying
70:56 - different lessons
70:57 - and if you want to unlock everything
70:59 - that brilliant has to offer
71:00 - through a premium subscription you will
71:02 - get the first 200 people to go through
71:04 - that link will get 20
71:05 - off now another thing that i'll say here
71:07 - because i already have
71:08 - brilliant and one of the things that you
71:10 - can see up here in the top right
71:11 - is a gift premium so this is something
71:14 - you know
71:15 - it's not traditional gift giving season
71:17 - right now but for me
71:18 - summer birthday is everybody in my
71:20 - family summer birthdays
71:21 - don't know what to get somebody a
71:23 - premium subscription to brilliant um
71:26 - for the the kid the adult the
71:29 - anybody of all ages who loves math
71:31 - science and and sort of con
71:33 - lifelong learning would like that so um
71:35 - let me go
71:36 - uh continue beautiful geometry so i'm
71:39 - five
71:40 - i've got five problems to go into this
71:41 - chapter um this is the one i did on the
71:43 - most recent live stream which i like
71:45 - shocked myself by getting this correct
71:47 - um if i
71:49 - remember um the explanation here
71:52 - is can be thought of as a series of
71:55 - progressively smaller upside down
71:57 - l shapes each one with dimensions half
71:59 - that of the previous
72:01 - so the red makes up one third of each
72:03 - shape
72:05 - since all the l shapes are similar
72:06 - they're the same fraction of red
72:08 - so the entire figure is one-third red
72:11 - okay so that's where i was last time
72:14 - let's look at the next one
72:16 - all right um so in answer to the prior
72:19 - problem
72:19 - okay another approach take each red
72:21 - square and make two copies
72:23 - one to the right and one below done in
72:26 - purple
72:28 - we can see that it's one third right red
72:31 - one red two purple one red two purple
72:34 - one red two purple
72:35 - one third okay all right so
72:40 - oh did i do this one already i guess i
72:43 - got this one i did this one too
72:45 - all right i haven't done this one okay
72:49 - um
72:52 - okay so let's look at this one to make
72:54 - this figure oh you know what's awesome
72:55 - about this
72:56 - is very quickly before i solve this i
72:59 - have a really interesting idea
73:02 - one of the things i love about brilliant
73:03 - by the way is it just gives me ideas for
73:05 - things to code so this is a great this
73:08 - would be a great demonstration of
73:09 - recursion
73:10 - so i'm gonna i'm gonna write um a
73:12 - function called
73:14 - uh my my square
73:18 - and it's going to take an x a y
73:22 - and a width and i'm going to draw a
73:25 - square
73:26 - at that x y and width let's fill it with
73:30 - blue
73:32 - you'll see why i'm calling it my square
73:33 - in a second i'm going to say my square
73:36 - 0 0 200.
73:40 - there we go and let's set the
73:43 - background to zero so we can see it
73:46 - there we go
73:47 - so now what's going on
73:50 - here if we go to this particular
73:54 - brilliant problem
73:57 - oh it's one quarter so that's not
74:01 - did i do did i just do one quarter i'm
74:03 - like lost my yeah that's one quarter
74:05 - okay so now this should be the next one
74:08 - should be one quarter
74:10 - so i should call then my square of x
74:14 - plus w
74:17 - y and i'm going to need let me set stop
74:20 - and then
74:21 - w divided by 2 or let's say times 0.5
74:25 - and i'm going to say if w
74:28 - is greater than one pixel i'll let it go
74:32 - to one pixel
74:33 - actually let's just let's go to 20
74:34 - pixels
74:37 - so this is recursion right to draw a
74:40 - square
74:41 - is to draw another square to the right
74:43 - of it that's half the size
74:46 - there we go does that look like
74:49 - um this it certainly does right
74:53 - and i think we can just go like keep
74:55 - going
74:57 - right there we go uh you know
75:00 - as long as it's greater than one and
75:03 - let's just say a stroke
75:05 - zero zero 255
75:08 - now what's interesting about this right
75:11 - is i could have a global variable called
75:13 - sum and
75:17 - just say sum plus equal w
75:20 - times w that would be the area
75:23 - and now i could say console log
75:27 - sum divided by what's the area of
75:30 - the whole thing width times width
75:34 - one third so i'm solving the
75:38 - problem through without thinking it
75:40 - through
75:41 - one-third so if i did another square
75:45 - um in the bot and below actually
75:48 - what happens if i would do this
75:52 - x plus h no no x
75:56 - y plus h
76:02 - well there is no h y plus w
76:05 - oh look at that that's one half clearly
76:09 - but hold on let's go to uh
76:13 - oh this is interesting uh stroke
76:18 - oh look at this lovely pattern
76:21 - look at this lovely pattern of course
76:23 - that's one half but that's not the point
76:25 - the point is
76:27 - with this and if i did two of these two
76:30 - thirds so the answer should be
76:32 - two-thirds
76:36 - where's my sound effect
76:38 - [Music]
76:40 - now oops oh i'm oh go back go back go
76:42 - back
76:44 - so now
76:48 - i did that in a sort of like weird way
76:50 - but
76:51 - um if looking at this
76:54 - i can see like the way that the
76:56 - brilliant website
76:58 - explained the brilliant website
76:59 - explained how to do it is i have one
77:01 - quarter
77:02 - one quarter and then i could take that
77:05 - square and put it here right fit it here
77:08 - and then i'm doing the same thing here
77:12 - uh with these two so so 1 two three
77:15 - two thirds it would be two-thirds i
77:17 - don't know i don't think i
77:19 - it was like it made sense in my head but
77:20 - i without being able to diagram it i'm
77:22 - sure if i show the explanation
77:25 - right we can see that's two-thirds
77:27 - because look it's always
77:29 - two out of three two at two out of three
77:32 - two out of three
77:33 - and keep going two out of three
77:37 - um so um by covering with blue and red
77:40 - successfully you can see that it is
77:42 - two-thirds
77:42 - this is interesting because i often
77:44 - think recursion will lead to
77:46 - an infinite area like if we look at the
77:48 - koch curve
77:53 - um or the the fractal snowflake this is
77:58 - one of my coding challenges here
78:00 - where if i this successively will create
78:04 - a path of infinite length
78:07 - and i've worked out this math before
78:10 - based on the rules of the recursive
78:12 - rules
78:13 - the um the measurements
78:16 - go go to infinity whereas in this case
78:20 - even though
78:21 - it is a recursive process
78:26 - as you can see the area uh
78:29 - converges to one half so the more you
78:32 - know
78:32 - the more times the closer
78:37 - i get to actually 0.5 now how
78:40 - how close could i get to 0.5 before i
78:42 - crash p5
78:45 - you know let me hit save here
78:48 - uh recursive
78:53 - and i can just um
78:56 - uh this is um for
78:59 - [Music]
79:01 - this so and let me by the way put this
79:04 - into the discord
79:06 - um under uh links
79:09 - look i did some coding today um so if
79:12 - you want to look at that code i just
79:13 - posted it in the discord
79:15 - geometric series an infinite sum so uh
79:18 - this converges to
79:19 - a constant
79:23 - um this length of the square
79:25 - circumference is also
79:26 - infinite yeah so i would assume that if
79:29 - we looked at the length
79:31 - of these uh
79:34 - you know if i added up w times
79:38 - four right if i um that's going to go to
79:43 - um well i don't wanna it's the sum
79:49 - 9 600 so let's let's look like if we
79:52 - stop at 10
79:54 - we get 4 800 stop at five
79:58 - fifty six hundred stop at one
80:01 - seventy two hundred 0.1 i'm just
80:06 - 9600.01
80:10 - i don't know if we're ever going to 12
80:12 - 800. so you can see that this probably
80:14 - tends to infinity
80:15 - um which is super interesting um
80:20 - the area is finite the circumference is
80:23 - infinite that's actually the same thing
80:25 - as within the koch curve okay
80:28 - um let me hit save on this this can be
80:32 - done
80:32 - uh let me let me actually uh put this
80:35 - back to like five
80:38 - i like how it actually looks with this
80:40 - little
80:41 - i'm not getting all the way there okay
80:44 - thank you
80:45 - to uh brilliant for um
80:49 - sponsoring the coding train i am going
80:51 - to take a very short break just for two
80:53 - or three minutes and when i come back
80:55 - i will actually look at and see if i can
80:57 - get the movenet machine learning model
80:59 - running
81:00 - and compare it to pose net so if you
81:02 - came here waiting for that
81:03 - you only had to wait uh of seven hairs
81:06 - and two freckles or one hour and 20
81:09 - minutes
81:10 - so apologies for that let's look at my
81:13 - viewership here how many people have i
81:14 - lost yeah
81:15 - i gained some people amazing all right
81:18 - uh it's not pronounced coke
81:20 - i thought it was i say koch i thought it
81:23 - was coke
81:25 - somebody somebody who can help me with
81:27 - the german please let me know i always
81:29 - get it wrong
81:30 - i will be back in less than five minutes
81:33 - thank you for sticking with me see you
81:35 - in a moment
81:42 - [Music]
82:02 - [Music]
82:08 - it's
82:09 - [Music]
82:22 - do
82:25 - [Music]
82:50 - do
82:56 - [Music]
83:18 - do
83:20 - [Music]
83:32 - do
83:38 - [Music]
83:45 - recording training breaking breaking
83:48 - news
83:49 - i should never look at my phone when i
83:51 - take a break
83:52 - i just got this notification from
83:54 - twitter and it says
83:57 - i'm going to read it to you live on air
83:58 - right now
84:00 - unfortunately the request to verify your
84:03 - account
84:04 - has been denied
84:06 - [Music]
84:11 - i don't know if you can see this can you
84:14 - see this
84:16 - it won't it won't uh it won't focus on
84:20 - it
84:21 - very sad oh well i don't need to be
84:24 - twitter verified
84:25 - i never wanted that blue check anyway
84:27 - twitter
84:29 - all right that was a short break i've
84:30 - got about a half an hour
84:32 - and let's take a look at movenet all
84:34 - right everybody uh so i'm gonna just
84:36 - close all these windows
84:38 - um we're gonna go look for move net
84:42 - tensorflow.js
84:46 - um okay so how do i get it
84:51 - tf.js models all right so
84:54 - looks like so let's just do this in the
84:57 - p5 web editor i was thinking i
84:59 - wasn't going to but now i think this
85:01 - actually makes sense
85:04 - um and
85:08 - i'm going to uh move net
85:11 - test let's grab
85:14 - the um
85:18 - i guess all we need we need all of these
85:21 - script tags
85:24 - okay
85:26 - put them all in index.html
85:30 - up here so i've got
85:33 - p5 and then all the tensorflow ones that
85:36 - i need
85:40 - um
85:44 - and then oh i don't i don't can't do
85:46 - that
85:48 - okay single pose
85:52 - create detector
85:55 - estimate poses all right
85:59 - so this looks like ah i don't wanna okay
86:03 - create a detector pass in pose net pose
86:08 - detection supported models move net
86:11 - okay
86:17 - single pose lightning model that let's
86:19 - start with that
86:29 - so hold on i need more space to code
86:34 - people
86:40 - yes yes comment this out
86:44 - there we go okay so
86:47 - um i'm going to write an
86:50 - async function
86:53 - init and
87:00 - let's create these
87:03 - two i'm just going to make them i'm
87:04 - going to make the detector a global
87:06 - variable
87:09 - and uh initialize it here
87:14 - and we can say um
87:18 - init
87:21 - and i guess
87:24 - does it work to make setup asynchronous
87:29 - i think it does okay like will draw not
87:32 - happen
87:33 - until um
87:37 - this is complete we'll find out so now
87:41 - uh what do i need to do next i can
87:44 - estimate poses from an image
87:49 - okay estimate poses from an image now
87:54 - what kind of image
87:56 - tensor 3d image data video element image
87:59 - element canvas element well that's great
88:02 - do i dare just start with video
88:09 - so now
88:12 - async function get poses
88:21 - and let's make that a global variable
88:25 - let's go to my pose net
88:28 - coding train example
88:31 - and let's just kind of grab some of the
88:34 - stuff that i was doing there
88:35 - so i have like a video element
88:40 - and i made the canvas
88:46 - uh let's make the canvas let's actually
88:48 - make it uh
88:50 - 320 by 240
88:53 - then i need to create the video
89:01 - does this work
89:06 - [Music]
89:09 - create capture video am i getting how
89:11 - come i don't see oh
89:15 - why don't i see the video oh cause i
89:18 - could hide
89:20 - i forgot that i had hide okay great
89:23 - there it is
89:24 - let's do uh video size 320 240.
89:29 - oh i think my kids are arguing with each
89:30 - other you might hear some shouting
89:35 - i have i have a emergency mute button if
89:37 - i
89:39 - okay all right so now
89:44 - let's just see if i can do video.elt
89:52 - uh console log opposes
89:56 - and let's just say let's make a button
90:01 - create button pose
90:06 - uh mouse pressed
90:10 - uh and just call get poses oh no
90:15 - mouse pressed get poses
90:20 - alright so now in theory when i press
90:23 - this button
90:24 - i should see and he poses it to text
90:27 - here in the console
90:37 - oh nothing happened did i press the
90:40 - button
90:41 - oh no stuff happened
90:45 - oh look at that
90:49 - so it looks to me like this is actually
90:52 - a hundred percent the same
90:56 - exact data and technique as
90:59 - posenet it's just a different model so
91:02 - to put this into ml5
91:03 - would just be swapping out loading a
91:05 - different model
91:08 - interesting um
91:12 - so uh let me so
91:15 - here's the thing so okay now the
91:18 - question is
91:22 - let's get rid of this can i
91:25 - call how do i um
91:29 - await init uh so create capture
91:33 - i think i get a call back here video
91:34 - ready
91:36 - so i can say video ready get poses
91:41 - let's see if this works
91:49 - no i didn't see okay hold on
91:57 - does that call back work just trying to
91:59 - figure out the sequence here
92:02 - of what it is i want to do
92:06 - yeah okay great get poses
92:11 - await detector estimate poses
92:14 - can i just call get poses again then
92:30 - um
92:34 - it is the same number of key points i
92:35 - believe 17 key points
92:43 - by the way now i'm reading there's a
92:44 - nice chat in the discord
92:46 - uh uh okay uh exit page
92:51 - how much did i lose there
92:55 - not too much
92:58 - um
93:04 - huh we do this in
93:09 - let's give it like a little set timeout
93:14 - oh wait a second oh wait a second wait a
93:16 - second wait a second i know the issue
93:20 - awaits
93:22 - i i'm do i forget that i've got
93:24 - everything like with the crazy
93:25 - asynchronous stuff going on here okay
93:28 - let's see
93:35 - video ready
93:43 - oh i didn't console log the poses
93:49 - console log poses we're gonna get this
93:52 - people
94:02 - there we go okay it's console logging
94:03 - the poses
94:08 - now um let's look at one of these
94:13 - uh here let's just try to draw something
94:18 - score key points so unfortunately
94:23 - um i can't remember which one is the no
94:25 - let's see okay like pose
94:27 - so ml5 we put all this stuff in to make
94:29 - it nicer
94:31 - but here pose api
94:36 - all right so these are
94:40 - got it move move net
94:44 - blaze pose pose nut so these are all
94:47 - doing the same thing
94:49 - um so the key points are
94:55 - is there a name and i didn't see a name
94:58 - nose is the first one though it looks
94:59 - like
95:02 - oh it is the first one is no it does
95:03 - have a name okay great so if i say
95:06 - um
95:12 - if i say um background
95:17 - uh ellipse
95:22 - this was the poses
95:27 - index zero
95:31 - dot key points
95:36 - index zero
95:40 - dot dot x
95:42 - can i do something like this uh let x
95:47 - x y equal
95:50 - pose a zero dot key point zero
95:54 - and then i should be able to just say
95:55 - ellipse x y
95:57 - 20 20 and like make it red
96:03 - so this is my new trick that i love
96:05 - which is if i have an object
96:07 - that has different properties like this
96:09 - object has an x and a y
96:11 - as well as a score and a name i can
96:13 - destructure the object and pull out
96:16 - the x and y properties into separate
96:17 - variables and i this is probably a case
96:20 - where you know
96:20 - technologies use const because those
96:22 - aren't going to change
96:25 - um let's see if this works
96:29 - um see what i get here
96:32 - and let me just take out the console log
96:34 - which is already out okay
96:36 - uh cannot read property ah so one thing
96:38 - i will need to say because it's going
96:39 - right to draw
96:43 - is if poses and
96:46 - poses dot length is greater than zero
96:49 - so as long as there are some poses and
96:52 - the length is greater than zero
96:55 - then time to find my nose
96:59 - i'm not taking so long to start up
97:04 - so it's definitely working um it doesn't
97:07 - seem to be in the right place
97:10 - is it um by default kind of giving me
97:14 - the information on the sort of 640
97:18 - by 480 video
97:29 - see what happens here
97:35 - okay so that looks right now let me
97:38 - go back to hiding the video and
97:42 - drawing it this auto i got to kill this
97:45 - auto refresh
97:47 - auto refresh is killing me image
97:50 - video zero zero
98:02 - oh i'm missing a that's why it's not red
98:13 - oh and i don't have auto refresh on
98:18 - um let's sit here
98:23 - okay now it's really really slow but
98:25 - i've artificially made it slow
98:27 - by putting that set timeout in there so
98:30 - what happens now
98:32 - if i just call this over and over again
98:37 - oh no no no no no oh wait
98:42 - get poses yeah
98:46 - okay
98:49 - right let's see
99:00 - come on let's go
99:06 - what happened have i crashed oh and i
99:09 - didn't hit save
99:10 - stop
99:13 - what am i doing wrong here
99:22 - i guess i'm not supposed to use the
99:24 - single
99:33 - estimate poses
99:44 - let's try the demo
99:58 - well this is look i made it work
100:02 - yay me
100:05 - so what did i do wrong here
100:11 - i guess do i need like a little set
100:12 - timeout oh i'm gonna have to
100:19 - well this is sad that i crashed the
100:21 - browser
100:25 - okay let's see
100:34 - line 31.
100:47 - all right so
100:58 - all right i guess
101:04 - but i want it to continue to call itself
101:06 - after it gets new poses
101:08 - i want it to call itself again
101:12 - i need to do a set timeout with a delay
101:14 - of zero
101:16 - interesting like how far can i push that
101:17 - delay
101:21 - why do i need that
101:28 - yeah interesting all right let's go
101:29 - through everything so now
101:32 - let's go through
101:37 - key point of
101:47 - let's go through all the key points
101:51 - and then
102:00 - um and let's
102:15 - let's see here how it goes let's see how
102:18 - fast
102:19 - is this
102:28 - okay what not iterable sketch dot
102:32 - length line 40.
102:40 - oh i used i forgot that i used
102:44 - a for of loop yes somebody in the chat
102:48 - wrote damn has
102:48 - had a long day and it's in fact
102:50 - definitely true
102:52 - yeah so if i were building my own system
102:54 - i would use like get um
102:58 - whoa what is going on here it's
103:00 - definitely pretty fast
103:01 - the question is and i think i'm going to
103:03 - need to step away from the
103:05 - camera here to get a better um
103:09 - view of it so let me give you all
103:13 - you you're all going to see that i'm
103:15 - wearing shorts today
103:17 - my pants are falling down that's not a
103:19 - good sign
103:24 - yeah so one thing i probably should do
103:26 - is only draw the points if they have a
103:28 - certain confidence
103:29 - above a certain level
103:33 - so it's hard
103:36 - um if um
103:39 - so what was it it was um score
103:44 - so if score is greater than 0.5
103:49 - let's draw those circles
103:53 - so i think there's you're seeing a lot
103:54 - of noise because there's a lot of points
103:56 - like my feet and various things that
103:57 - can't see
103:58 - and so it's drawing them even when it
104:00 - has no confidence
104:02 - but now we can see and
104:06 - it's it's definitely very accurate now
104:09 - it can't find me it doesn't really know
104:12 - how much of my body needs to be visible
104:14 - it really needs to see a head to be able
104:16 - to see the arm
104:20 - but full body it's working quite well
104:25 - so the question is like how different is
104:27 - this
104:28 - from posner
104:32 - like can i very quickly just load a
104:35 - different model
104:38 - this is single pose lightning
104:41 - um what were
104:51 - um
104:54 - i wanted to see
104:59 - this is a blog post about it which is
105:01 - not what i'm interested in
105:05 - here's what i'm looking for
105:07 - [Music]
105:08 - i wanted to see here
105:13 - supported models
105:19 - so what are the supported models
105:28 - um
105:31 - where did i do that
105:36 - oh this is my posnet example
105:42 - like
105:49 - like if i change this to pose net
105:58 - what would happen
106:04 - by the way did the interact did an
106:07 - interactive console while just appear in
106:09 - the web editor why it wasn't looking
106:11 - like hold on i have to show you all this
106:27 - uh oh something crashed no it crashed
106:30 - again
106:31 - uh pose net has blue and move net has
106:35 - red overlay them with different colors
106:37 - ooh that's an interesting idea
106:40 - um okay hold on i don't know what's
106:43 - going on here
106:52 - but
106:55 - is this the working version look at this
106:57 - as soon as i run the sketch
107:00 - this interactive thing appears this is
107:02 - this is new like this was recently been
107:06 - added
107:12 - oh but i it crashes the crash soon as i
107:15 - try to log something
107:17 - it crashes it that's what was crashing
107:19 - it so maybe it needs
107:20 - that needs a little like the interactive
107:23 - console must needs a little bit of work
107:25 - maybe i'm not using it in the proper way
107:29 - um okay so this is great
107:32 - um um alpha equals confidence that's a
107:36 - pretty cool idea actually
107:38 - um um use the use hue for the confidence
107:43 - yeah
107:43 - these are these are some great ideas um
107:46 - so of course there's all sorts of
107:47 - possible things we could do
107:48 - with this let me just make sure this
107:50 - example is still working
107:54 - and will it actually work with set
107:57 - timeout zero
107:59 - i find that hard to believe but let's
108:00 - try it
108:05 - yeah this should crack oh no so set
108:08 - timeout zero
108:09 - it actually works amazing and this does
108:12 - i mean i don't know if the one
108:13 - millisecond makes a difference
108:15 - but it feels very responsive very fast i
108:18 - don't know
108:19 - can we um all right let's try
108:22 - as was suggested
108:28 - but we're going to have an issue though
108:32 - well let's just see if we can
108:35 - anecdotally
108:38 - kind of see so this is pose net in ml5
108:46 - i don't know why it's not
108:50 - nothing is coming up
108:55 - that's weird is it like not want to have
108:59 - both running at the same time
109:09 - so can you get a sense of lag
109:14 - and accuracy so look at me moving back
109:17 - and forth
109:19 - what's the lag what's the accuracy
109:23 - let's look at this model which in theory
109:25 - should be an improvement
109:33 - can't necessarily tell much difference
109:39 - can you um does this have to be on a
109:43 - person or could it be for objects too
109:45 - so this and simon fletcher writes set
109:48 - timeout zero just adds it to the end of
109:50 - the execution queue so that's super
109:52 - helpful thank you
109:54 - um
110:01 - yeah so my my next question here is if i
110:04 - go
110:04 - to um the ml5 library
110:17 - and let me bring this back down to some
110:20 - more space here
110:22 - and i go to source and i know you can't
110:25 - entirely see this
110:27 - and go to posenet
110:31 - and look at index.js so
110:34 - what this is doing is it is loading
110:38 - um a particular
110:41 - model with a particular set of
110:44 - settings mobilenet v1
110:49 - a weight pose net load
110:54 - what is pose net
110:58 - so like how how hard would it be
111:01 - to change this to um
111:04 - movenet this is a project that i would
111:07 - like to work on
111:09 - and you can see here this would all stay
111:11 - the same
111:14 - it's more about
111:17 - it's interesting it's called confidence
111:19 - rather than score
111:21 - so this is something that i would
111:23 - definitely need to up
111:25 - pose net here um
111:34 - okay well
111:38 - this was a live stream
111:42 - it would be great if you draw an eye
111:44 - texture instead of eyes
111:46 - try the cat
111:50 - it's a great idea uh will it detect the
111:53 - cat
111:55 - can you have them running side by side
111:58 - in
111:58 - theory yes but i'm not sure the best way
112:03 - for me to do that right now or if that's
112:05 - worth
112:06 - doing um
112:12 - i'm kind of lost as to what i what
112:15 - today's live stream is about
112:17 - [Music]
112:21 - it's been a long week
112:24 - this week was my kids last week of
112:26 - school everything is all
112:28 - turned upside down i need i need uh
112:31 - i need us to like something to do to
112:33 - finish off
112:34 - this stream oh read random numbers i
112:37 - forgot about reading the random numbers
112:39 - i should just do that
112:43 - i'm looking for suggestions i like the
112:46 - eye texture idea
112:51 - um i thank you uh thank you cp
112:56 - can you make a data set um
113:03 - well i'm reading the chat here
113:13 - um rigging this to a 3d character
113:15 - actually so one of the things i wanted
113:16 - to explore was
113:17 - v tubing um it's not really my
113:20 - wheelhouse
113:21 - but i thought it would be fun to try to
113:22 - do like a live stream as an animated
113:24 - character
113:25 - and um that's definitely something that
113:27 - i could do here
113:29 - with um pose net
113:32 - or move net in this case probably what
113:35 - would make more sense would be in case
113:37 - you're not familiar with this
113:42 - would be also to look at the face
113:46 - face mesh so um
113:51 - this is not one that i spent a lot of
113:52 - time uh
113:54 - exploring
113:57 - but this could be good for my
114:01 - v-tubing idea let's see how well this
114:03 - works
114:06 - this is the uh a new this this was a new
114:08 - model that was added to ml5
114:10 - fairly recently holy smokes
114:14 - okay that is insane
114:19 - that is an insane number of points
114:23 - what the oh my goodness i have never
114:27 - this is not what i expected to see i
114:28 - knew it was like a mesh with a lot of
114:30 - points
114:31 - but that is wildly accurate in fact i
114:34 - mean it definitely has trouble when i
114:35 - turn my head
114:36 - but you know that's to be expected um
114:40 - that is crazy what could i do with this
114:45 - look at these points here
114:53 - so if the predictions just gives me a
114:56 - lot of key points
114:58 - and each one has an xy i guess i could i
115:01 - could definitely feed this into a
115:02 - classifier
115:07 - can i break it
115:13 - the triangles are not there yeah
115:16 - um this would be interesting to actually
115:19 - create
115:20 - uh to actually make it a proper mesh and
115:23 - then texture it
115:25 - so i don't really have time in the next
115:27 - five minutes to do that
115:29 - oh look my ear is a face look at my ear
115:33 - it's a face my hand is a face
115:37 - beard detection algorithm that would be
115:39 - an interesting one
115:41 - um but this is this is cool to see
115:44 - um i feel like this um
115:48 - this live stream today is
115:52 - is uh just like falling i'm like falling
115:55 - over the finish line
115:56 - ending with a a little
116:00 - splat supposed to a grand finale of
116:03 - something exciting that
116:04 - anybody could use can i make something
116:06 - out of this
116:08 - um let's try i have an idea let's make
116:11 - something out of this
116:12 - okay i got four minutes and i'm gonna
116:16 - make something out of this so first
116:17 - thing i'm gonna do
116:19 - is i'm not gonna draw
116:22 - the video image background
116:26 - zero
116:30 - then i'm going to go to my go to
116:39 - you know particle i need just any old
116:42 - particle system example shader webgl
116:46 - that would be an interesting one to try
116:48 - but i'm a little bit afraid particles
116:50 - following the mouse
116:52 - um particle emitters color
116:56 - sure this will this will work okay this
116:59 - is great perfect
117:01 - so oh the emitter that's fine
117:05 - so i just need an emitter class
117:11 - i gotta make something today i gotta
117:14 - make a project
117:14 - a four minutes left this is the coding
117:16 - train is me rambling
117:18 - for an hour and a half two hours
117:20 - realizing i have five minutes left and i
117:22 - need to make a project
117:24 - just coming up with something i guess i
117:26 - should really have these particles
117:27 - coming out of my eyes which i only need
117:28 - the um
117:31 - uh um movement for it's gonna make them
117:33 - coming out of my mouth as i talk
117:35 - but i don't know which key points i'll
117:36 - just have them come out of all the key
117:37 - points that'll be fine
117:38 - what could possibly go wrong particle.js
117:44 - okay um so now
117:47 - uh i need to link to both of these
117:53 - um in here
117:59 - okay and now let's also grab my so this
118:02 - is an example from
118:07 - this is an example from
118:11 - oh i'm in posenet here no i want to be
118:13 - in face mesh
118:18 - from nature of code particle systems
118:20 - chapter
118:21 - in case you're trying to follow along
118:23 - good luck to you
118:26 - sketch.js let's just grab this
118:30 - [Music]
118:32 - uh
118:36 - and let's just create an emitter
118:40 - in the middle
118:45 - all right let's see what happens here do
118:48 - i dare
118:49 - so right now i should have my face mesh
118:59 - what's happening
119:09 - stop close close
119:17 - too much open
119:25 - uh
119:29 - what just happened what did i break
119:46 - is there's some other error i don't see
119:48 - ah emitter is not defined
119:58 - i lost i didn't notice i lost the body
120:01 - tag
120:03 - that'll do it oh wait a second
120:06 - it happened it happened
120:12 - welcome kay you have joined
120:16 - the passengers of the coating train here
120:20 - in the building still the pole is still
120:22 - there
120:23 - in the very last negative
120:26 - one minute of the coding strain you have
120:28 - boosted my energy you have brought me
120:30 - you filled me with joy and happiness
120:32 - and you are going to get your very own
120:36 - random number
120:39 - um which is on page 283
120:43 - uh row 14 130 column
120:46 - zero the sequence is four one five three
120:49 - seven and i have so much to say
120:51 - about the random numbers and the
120:53 - whistles and the discord bot but no no
120:55 - no no no back to what i was doing
121:00 - oh so k uh since you actually are in the
121:02 - chat um
121:03 - make sure you see the google form fill
121:05 - out that google form that when you join
121:06 - as a member and
121:07 - uh join the discord everybody should
121:09 - join the discord but if you
121:11 - are um signed up as a supporter of the
121:13 - coding train and join the discord and
121:15 - link to your youtube account you'll have
121:17 - access to our member-only channels
121:18 - where we have um where we talk about uh
121:21 - random numbers and train whistles
121:23 - that's literally what you get okay um
121:26 - now back to this
121:30 - get this to work before i go
121:34 - all right i really messed something up
121:35 - here
121:38 - how did i mess up
121:43 - this html so badly i have to make the
121:45 - font smaller i cannot
121:48 - i just do not have enough space
121:52 - something is oh slash body oh no no no
121:54 - this goes here oh my goodness
121:56 - no i put it all in the wrong place
122:02 - there we go
122:05 - emitter is not defined oh my goodness
122:08 - what is going on
122:10 - the order here shouldn't matter right
122:19 - somebody tell me what i did wrong oh
122:20 - this is the worst
122:22 - uh sketch line 10
122:25 - emitter equals new emitter oh i didn't
122:28 - copy paste the code that's what you've
122:30 - been telling me for so
122:32 - long
122:34 - [Music]
122:37 - [Laughter]
122:41 - [Music]
122:44 - oh hilarity and hilarity ensues
122:48 - oh gosh i'm i'm fired it's not given
122:51 - this is my last live stream ever
122:52 - sorry everybody i can't do it anymore oh
122:55 - no this is the particles okay we're
122:57 - gonna get there people
123:00 - okay
123:04 - come on come on computer
123:09 - you can do it bring this over so i can
123:12 - see all right so now
123:16 - where are my particles
123:22 - oh i commented it out
123:32 - okay great now the face mesh is about to
123:36 - load
123:37 - i should really just be doing this with
123:38 - the move net example this is very silly
123:41 - that i'm trying to do it with the face
123:43 - with the face mesh but here we go
123:46 - now i know what to do uh now instead of
123:49 - we're not going to draw this image
123:52 - um we can do emitter show emitter update
123:56 - but here i want to say
124:00 - i'm not going to draw i just want to
124:04 - release
124:05 - some particles so update the emitter's
124:08 - position to that x y
124:10 - and just emit one particle also let's
124:13 - only do this
124:15 - like one percent of the time
124:19 - and so one out of a hundred key points
124:23 - let's see what happens caution to the
124:27 - wind everybody
124:34 - okay so uh you can't i've completely
124:36 - lost any sense of my face
124:40 - um but i think i have an idea for how to
124:43 - get it back
124:44 - so the particle can really just
124:47 - fade out super fast so much faster
124:52 - then i think i might be able to manage
124:59 - to do it for a much higher percentage of
125:02 - the points
125:05 - i want to make my face is like the end
125:07 - of um
125:08 - raiders of the lost ark my face is going
125:10 - to melt
125:15 - oh interesting i could have them move up
125:18 - and be kind of red and they would be
125:20 - it would be much more like fiery so
125:22 - where's is there a gravity force
125:24 - somewhere
125:26 - um i can't remember how i'm doing apply
125:30 - force is there a gravity force somewhere
125:32 - yes so
125:34 - the gravity should point up and be let's
125:36 - make it much stronger
125:39 - let's also do um
125:45 - a little bit risky but blend mode add
125:50 - and then particle where's
125:53 - let's not use any alpha it'll make it
126:01 - uh just give it like a red color based
126:04 - on its lifetime
126:05 - and let's see no i can't
126:09 - maybe it'll work better if i remove my
126:10 - hat no then you will see my hat hair
126:14 - can't have that oh oh right i need the
126:17 - clear
126:19 - um i don't know why i'm trying to make
126:22 - my
126:23 - face somehow be like fiery
126:27 - but um not really what i was thinking i
126:29 - was doing but
126:30 - let's see what happens oh and i need um
126:33 - of course for the additive blending to
126:36 - work
126:37 - we need some
126:41 - amount of
126:50 - green and blue
126:57 - and also the background
127:02 - should be zero why am i
127:06 - okay there we go
127:11 - i think this is going to be what i meant
127:13 - to do
127:14 - come on
127:25 - uh why why why okay couple things
127:29 - let's let's get rid of
127:36 - the stroke very unnecessary
127:45 - i really gotta go but i may want to make
127:47 - a project here
127:48 - uh very unnecessary um
127:52 - let's
127:57 - uh let's pump this up
128:04 - i don't know what i'm doing i'm just
128:05 - playing with numbers
128:08 - if i make lines between the particles
128:10 - yeah this is what i was trying to get
128:15 - um i now i understand what i need to do
128:22 - [Music]
128:26 - i think this is what i am meaning to do
128:40 - okay not exactly what i meant
128:46 - too much
128:49 - it's amazing how fast it is i should
128:52 - probably put the video back
128:54 - which would be interesting oh i forgot
128:56 - that i have to keep having to reset it
128:59 - particles are too fast says k yeah i
129:02 - think you might be right about that
129:10 - i think the additive blending isn't
129:11 - really doing the job that i wanted it to
129:13 - do
129:15 - let's try making that uh force
129:19 - a little bit less and
129:22 - i also i really would love to be able to
129:23 - get more particles out
129:27 - actually so
129:30 - where where where did i do that
129:34 - um let's double the amount of particles
129:39 - texture mapping on the mesh would be
129:41 - nice too yes
129:44 - i probably should make them smaller
129:49 - well now they're just kind of uh
129:53 - sparkly um that's not really what i
129:56 - meant
129:57 - either let's
130:03 - let's
130:09 - i'm gonna get the effect that i'm
130:11 - looking for
130:12 - radial forces centered around the eye
130:14 - positions yeah
130:20 - there this is kind of this is more like
130:21 - what i was imagining
130:24 - it's a little bit
130:30 - too so this is definitely more like what
130:31 - i was imagining
130:34 - there we go now the real exciting moment
130:38 - here that i'm going to finish with
130:44 - um is adding
130:50 - um the video back
131:02 - and these are just
131:06 - cpu particles um luneo music
131:10 - is asking
131:15 - i mean we've completely lost the face
131:17 - mesh
131:19 - so that's a little bit unfortunate
131:24 - um i could try
131:36 - um
131:41 - i could put the face mesh on
131:48 - i actually like it better without seeing
131:52 - the video image
132:08 - something i had earlier i feel like was
132:10 - better let me go back to
132:17 - this i've got to stop i'm gonna just
132:20 - play with a few more parameters
132:24 - and then be done
132:38 - looks like diving in a bottle set up yes
132:40 - sliders would really help
132:44 - sliders would really help
133:00 - um
133:08 - bubbly face
133:15 - i gotta end with something here
133:18 - yeah there we go
133:30 - now now we're talking
133:38 - don't worry i'm gonna get this exactly
133:39 - what i'm going for you'll see
133:50 - [Laughter]
133:52 - low cash says i left for three minutes
133:54 - and dan has a burning face
134:01 - bubbly face
134:06 - well i'm sure somebody can make a better
134:08 - version of this
134:12 - but i'm i'm happy with what i've got so
134:14 - far
134:15 - i think i like it uh with a slightly
134:17 - larger
134:19 - circle and what's the chance
134:22 - i just want to just try one last thing
134:27 - what if i were to do every single point
134:30 - and have the particles
134:34 - fade out quite a bit faster
134:40 - okay this is probably going to run way
134:43 - way way too slow
134:46 - but i'm going to leave this code with
134:47 - all of you to experiment and make a
134:49 - better version of this
134:52 - yeah okay so this is what i was
134:54 - imagining
134:56 - um and now i'm realizing that
134:59 - it kind of works but
135:07 - and i really just get rid of the red
135:09 - color
135:12 - i just need to
135:22 - yeah what i really just need to do is
135:23 - not use all of the face mesh points
135:26 - and then i'll be able to have this run
135:27 - fast enough where i can have the
135:29 - particles
135:29 - trail off more but this i do kind of
135:32 - like
135:32 - now in the sense that uh i can see
135:37 - the pattern and it would make sense for
135:39 - me to
135:41 - get rid of the video and maybe maybe
135:44 - maybe just
135:45 - let a little bit of like 20 fewer spots
135:51 - and this is going to be the last time i
135:53 - run this
135:55 - i promise
136:03 - well thank you for watching today's
136:06 - episode of i should just do this
136:08 - yeah here we go thank you for watching
136:12 - today's episode of
136:14 - the coding train uh brought to you by
136:20 - uh oh wait hold on i have to do this
136:23 - brilliant
136:25 - if you would like to learn all about
136:29 - how to do physics programming and have
136:32 - your
136:32 - face turn into a fiery set of particles
136:36 - you can both watch the coding train and
136:38 - check out brilliant
136:40 - at brilliant the coding train i will see
136:43 - you all
136:45 - next friday i'll be back for another
136:46 - live stream two live streams in june
136:48 - plenty of new videos hopefully we'll
136:50 - come out soon this is me as now a v
136:52 - tuber i have now become a v tuber all i
136:55 - need is like some music
137:02 - thanks for tuning in to today's episode
137:04 - of the coding frame with me
137:05 - your host fiery face
137:08 - [Music]
137:09 - i am an ai generated
137:12 - particle system with a nose oh you can't
137:16 - see me scratching my nose or i might
137:17 - have to sneeze at any moment
137:19 - but this is the coding train this is
137:22 - what you tuned in for this code example
137:24 - will be available for you in the discord
137:26 - please join at thecodingtrain.com
137:29 - discord talk to the bot to subscribe to
137:32 - the notifications
137:34 - you can also subscribe to the coding
137:35 - training
137:37 - and watch the nature of code series all
137:38 - about particle systems or
137:40 - a beginner's guide to machine learning
137:42 - with ml5.js all of those things
137:45 - i will see you all next friday on the
137:46 - coding train stay tuned for some new
137:49 - videos being released
137:50 - i really appreciate all of you i feel
137:53 - happy that this live stream ended
137:56 - i assume that any moment now kevin feige
137:59 - from marvel will give me a call because
138:01 - i just won't believe this effect we need
138:03 - it
138:04 - for some new exciting marvel project
138:08 - that's never gonna happen i might get it
138:11 - uh all right i'm just gonna show people
138:15 - um where you can get this code right now
138:18 - before i leave um let's go to
138:21 - i'm taking this uh the
138:24 - thecodingtrain.com
138:25 - discord um if you join the discord
138:30 - uh respond to all the stuff you need to
138:32 - respond to
138:33 - um go to the lynx channel

138:41 - streaming next one will be next friday
138:43 - and i will see you all next time
138:47 - on the coding train as always i always
138:50 - forget that this
138:51 - this stock it stop this stop i'm gonna
138:52 - do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this
138:55 - this stop this stop this stop
