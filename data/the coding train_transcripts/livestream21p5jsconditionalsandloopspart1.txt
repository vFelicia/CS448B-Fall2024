00:04 - okay I think I am live could anybody
00:09 - hear me or see me one for mark the one
00:12 - person is out there let me just check
00:15 - the cameras here this is another camera
00:20 - I should have checked the focus actually
00:22 - before I started I think it's good let's
00:27 - see how well can you read that
00:35 - okay I'm doing now I can see we can see
00:39 - what's how long the delay is now okay
00:49 - low audio okay I can raise the I can
00:56 - raise the volume level great okay audio
01:04 - is good okay okay okay I gotta turn
01:09 - myself but the view of myself watching
01:11 - myself off because I think you
01:12 - definitely crazy so now the stream is
01:15 - working I'm gonna turn the volume off
01:17 - I'm gonna hide this for a minute
01:20 - and I will come and check that actually
01:23 - I wonder if there I need a chat only
01:25 - view because I'm like looking at myself
01:27 - okay I got to turn the cameras back on I
01:30 - know camera turned off okay so which let
01:40 - me start over here uh let me fix this a
01:43 - little bit there we go okay so welcome
01:48 - if you are actually watching this live
01:51 - I'm here live thirty seconds ahead of
01:56 - you my time is different
01:59 - I'm my intention right now is to record
02:02 - some video lessons so the video lessons
02:05 - I'm hoping will be about ten minutes
02:07 - each and this however what you are
02:10 - watching is kind of
02:11 - raw uncut footage so to speak where I
02:14 - will do some like warm-up exercises
02:17 - vocal exercises make trip and make sort
02:20 - of mistakes and configure things and
02:22 - that sort of thing I have a list of
02:23 - videos that I would like to make that
02:25 - I'm going to talk through and what I
02:26 - will do is periodically in between
02:28 - recording videos check the chat because
02:32 - I welcome feedback or questions and that
02:35 - sort of thing I mean ultimately I'm not
02:36 - sure maybe all this should just be the
02:38 - live stuff but right now the system that
02:40 - I'm using can broadcast live and then I
02:42 - hit another button that's kind of like
02:43 - record so these moments we're all going
02:45 - to like record mode trying to do a 10
02:47 - minute video the topics for today are I
02:51 - need like a big screen that just has the
02:53 - chat going on it not that there's like a
02:55 - lot of activity and so on in the chat
02:56 - but it's nice to have to feel that
02:58 - there's somebody there my list that you
03:01 - can't see over here on this wall is oh
03:03 - the overall thing is I want to talk
03:05 - about conditional statements and loops
03:08 - and actually if I looked at my old
03:10 - videos that I made last year with
03:13 - processing and were like almost 10
03:15 - videos and they're divided up in
03:17 - sequence ttan I'm gonna try to condense
03:19 - this a little bit so I just want to
03:20 - perhaps have a video that's just
03:22 - basically about boolean expression in an
03:25 - if statement I need to look at I want to
03:28 - look at how you get a thing that's
03:30 - moving to turnaround which is sort of a
03:32 - classic first conditional statement
03:34 - problem I want to look a cover else and
03:37 - else if as well as and at or at some
03:39 - point and then want to look at loops and
03:41 - drawing shapes in a loop and talk about
03:43 - the distinction between a loop like a
03:46 - for loop or a while loop and the draw
03:48 - loop the draw loop that's looping
03:50 - forever for the purpose of animation
03:52 - which there's always a kind of key point
03:54 - of confusion for students as well as
03:57 - maybe if I have time I don't know how
03:59 - much time I'm gonna try to do this all
04:00 - the way up till lunch for about two
04:01 - hours so I have to take a break at 11:30
04:04 - to go I'm quick quick quick task I've to
04:06 - do it 11:30 and then I want to also talk
04:10 - about see if I can have a chance to make
04:11 - a video about a loop within a loop so a
04:13 - nested loop and drawing things on a grid
04:15 - which i think is a nice kind of thing to
04:17 - play with when you're first starting
04:18 - okay so I'm gonna like ease on over here
04:21 - I have this button
04:22 - which switches to this view and now I
04:24 - see myself like 30 seconds ago I'm gonna
04:26 - check the chat left only left ear hmm oh
04:33 - yeah shoot I would like to fix this I
04:37 - don't know how shoot
04:40 - so unfortunately yeah so I think I got
04:46 - it I'm gonna make a note of this
04:48 - somewhere ah the audio thing I think
04:49 - when it records the okay I have an idea
04:51 - unfortunately I'll put I'm over here
04:57 - Audio shoot view details audio audio ah
05:04 - mono this waiting to do uh save shoot
05:12 - okay I wonder if that fixed it for all
05:14 - of you with the one ear problem I just
05:16 - changed the stream setting to mono I
05:18 - have to wait unfortunately like about a
05:21 - few seconds for you to like catch up to
05:24 - me in real time but did I fix it for
05:27 - anybody I could stop and start the whole
05:28 - thing but I'm a little disinclined to do
05:31 - so it's I hate this lag I've got to get
05:35 - this more real time has a change for
05:40 - anyone nope so it's still one year huh
05:46 - okay I have a feeling if I stop and
05:49 - start actually maybe I could just I have
05:51 - an idea I think if you all stay on this
05:53 - page and I go to live control room which
05:58 - you can see now what I'm going to do is
06:01 - press this button that says stop
06:04 - streaming so I think you'll see a break
06:05 - and then I'm gonna hit restart and
06:07 - hopefully the audio will fix okay so I'm
06:11 - gonna stop I will not be able to restart
06:15 - no I don't want to do that okay shoot
06:21 - can you guys tolerate this hope you can
06:23 - view and watch page so I think
06:27 - unfortunately the whoops
06:30 - yeah sorry everybody
06:32 - so unfortunately this it's just going to
06:35 - be
06:36 - in one year right now I apologize for
06:39 - that the videos that are getting
06:41 - recorded it's get recorded as a mono
06:43 - signal into both ears into stereo so
06:46 - when you watch the videos later so I
06:49 - wish I wish I had a good I wish I could
06:53 - just fix this right now but didn't seem
06:55 - to work okay keep going thank you guys
06:57 - okay all right so I'm I'm getting ready
07:01 - now so I'm gonna put this away I've got
07:06 - my p5 Sketch open this is the p5 sketch
07:09 - I'm going to start with when I start to
07:12 - look at conditional statements and then
07:17 - over here is where I'm going to start
07:19 - talking about conditional statements and
07:21 - I'm ready okay so I'm gonna check back I
07:24 - just hit the record button in a second
07:26 - and I'm gonna check back after I record
07:28 - this first video which I hope will be 5
07:30 - to 10 minutes I'll check back if you
07:31 - guys have feedback or questions and you
07:34 - know if anybody has any significant
07:35 - feedback I might I might do it again
07:39 - actually I forgot to put this sign which
07:43 - says recording you can't see it on my
07:45 - door so there's a door here look at the
07:49 - outside world over here okay uh here we
07:55 - go that was a little bit of coffee which
08:02 - I'm drinking and boy I've been going for
08:05 - 20 minutes so far not having a serve
08:06 - recording this is terrible ok 1038 here
08:08 - we go and one two okay I gotta start
08:16 - over
08:22 - hello again so this video I am now
08:25 - starting a new little section of videos
08:26 - about working with code and programming
08:28 - and all that fun stuff in p5.js and the
08:31 - topic here is conditional statements
08:33 - conditional statements boolean
08:35 - expressions true or false if this than
08:38 - that if this than that otherwise this
08:40 - how does a program make decisions while
08:43 - it's running so in the previous videos
08:45 - when we started working with variables
08:46 - my topic was kind of okay how do we
08:49 - store information and that information
08:50 - changes over time
08:51 - now we start to think about this new
08:53 - question how can a program take
08:55 - different paths right the only path we
08:58 - really have right now is starting and
09:01 - setup that's the first thing that
09:02 - happens
09:05 - moving on to draw and looping over and
09:09 - over again draw repeats over and over
09:10 - again we saw that you have these event
09:13 - functions like there was also the event
09:16 - function mousepressed
09:18 - so if you click the mouse the code would
09:20 - take a break from draw go execute
09:22 - something down here and continue and
09:23 - draw again but now I want to ask the
09:25 - question how can the code executes
09:28 - differently each time through draw so
09:31 - one time through draw it might draw a
09:32 - purple circle and the next time through
09:34 - draw it might draw a pink circle and in
09:36 - fact this I would like to be the first
09:39 - example that I make in this particular
09:41 - video I don't know if I if I can get
09:43 - purple and pink just right but I want to
09:45 - have a circle that's drawn with two
09:47 - different colors based on something that
09:49 - the user is doing perhaps where the user
09:51 - is positioning the mouse would be a good
09:53 - place to start
09:55 - so in order to do this we need to learn
09:57 - about conditional logic another sort of
10:04 - term we can think of in this case is
10:06 - boolean expression boolean logic from
10:10 - the mathematician logician George Poulos
10:14 - which I'm probably not getting right
10:17 - internet will correct meaning I assume
10:19 - dub dub this over or put some sort of
10:22 - like pop-up thing I don't know whatever
10:23 - fancy thing that works here so boolean
10:25 - boolean the word boolean indicates that
10:28 - something is true or false this is often
10:32 - also thought of as
10:33 - one or zero zero being false one being
10:36 - true and what what I'm going to show you
10:39 - how to write is an expression that says
10:41 - if something is true do this code if
10:44 - something is not true don't do this code
10:47 - so let's think about how the kinds of
10:51 - things the kinds of boolean expressions
10:53 - that might evaluate to true or false so
10:58 - I'm going to give you a boolean
11:00 - expression right now and in your mind
11:01 - you will think about whether it's true
11:03 - or false and hopefully this will be a
11:04 - rather easy one five is greater than six
11:11 - this is not true
11:13 - this evaluates to false there's another
11:18 - one seven is less than 210 this is true
11:25 - so you can see I'm starting by creating
11:28 - these boolean expressions using
11:30 - something called a relational operator a
11:34 - relational operator it's an operator
11:38 - that is going that in this case is going
11:39 - to compare two numbers there's lots of
11:42 - ways eventually in code that you'll see
11:44 - that you can have something that's true
11:46 - or false but a good way to start is just
11:49 - comparing numbers are these numbers
11:50 - equal is one number bigger than the
11:52 - other one or is one number less than the
11:54 - other one so now that we have this idea
11:57 - of how we can create a boolean
11:59 - expression a mathematical operation that
12:01 - evaluates to either only two answers
12:04 - true or false we can learn the syntax
12:07 - for writing that statement into our code
12:09 - and this is how the syntax works if
12:11 - we've got a word in the English language
12:13 - if that means exactly what it says if
12:17 - some boolean expression that is inside
12:21 - parentheses this is our boolean
12:23 - expression if boolean expression open
12:28 - curly braket close curly bracket so
12:31 - we've created another block of code this
12:34 - is a block of code with the beginning or
12:35 - at end just like setup and draw our
12:37 - blocks of code with beginning and ends
12:39 - and the key thing here is if if this
12:43 - boolean expression evaluates to true
12:46 - then the code here should be executed if
12:49 - this boolean expression evaluates to
12:51 - false then the code here should not be
12:53 - executed so let's say I write something
12:57 - like if five is greater than six fill to
13:03 - 5500 so only ever if five is greater
13:08 - than six should you set a red color now
13:10 - if you're thinking about this piece of
13:12 - code here you're realizing this is what
13:14 - I would have created in this scenario is
13:15 - kind of ridiculous and and useless in a
13:18 - way like five no matter how much we try
13:20 - over and over and over again five is
13:23 - never going to be greater than six ever
13:24 - I can't I mean maybe there'll be another
13:26 - universe or a parallel universe or some
13:28 - other kind of wormhole thing we go
13:30 - through and five will be in the six but
13:32 - right now in this room where I am under
13:33 - these very hot lights that make me feel
13:36 - a little faint for a second and five is
13:38 - not greater than six so you can see this
13:40 - is while this is the correct syntax this
13:41 - is showing us the idea here this doesn't
13:43 - really make any sense the point of what
13:46 - I'm trying to show you is that if a
13:48 - variable is part of this boolean
13:50 - expression a variable has different
13:51 - values at different times of the day and
13:53 - different moments depending on what
13:55 - other things are happening in the code
13:56 - then that variable might sometimes be
13:59 - greater than six or might sometimes not
14:01 - be greater than six and so we can change
14:03 - this expression to say something like if
14:08 - Mouse X is greater than 100 so now as
14:13 - the user is moving the mouse it's not
14:15 - greater than 100 it's not greater it is
14:17 - greater than one so this code even
14:19 - though it's sitting there in the draw
14:21 - loop I haven't put it there yet but
14:22 - that's where it will live this code will
14:24 - not necessarily be executed in fact you
14:26 - could run the program if the mouse never
14:28 - goes past 100 my code will never happen
14:30 - it will just sit there never get
14:32 - executed this is the power of a
14:34 - conditional statement so let's go and
14:37 - look and put this into our example and I
14:39 - think that will actually wrap up this
14:40 - video just sort of the very very basics
14:42 - and there's more to it than this but
14:45 - I'll get to that okay okay so here we
14:48 - are I have a nice simple example that I
14:50 - prepared in advance this is me actually
14:52 - preparing to make one of these videos in
14:54 - advance
14:55 - I've got create canvas up here
14:58 - I'm drawing a circle so no fill so what
15:01 - I would like to do now is add something
15:03 - down here
15:04 - if Mouse X is greater than and let's say
15:08 - 300 which is the middle of the window
15:11 - fill i 255 0 let's try to give ourselves
15:16 - some purplish color and we can see this
15:19 - is what I've added here this is the
15:21 - syntax so you can see what you can see a
15:25 - couple things here so the boolean
15:27 - expression is in between parentheses the
15:29 - if statement opens with the curly
15:30 - bracket ends with a curly bracket and
15:32 - notice how Phil gets indented so the
15:34 - indentation is not changed the way the
15:36 - code runs but it helps you visually see
15:39 - you could have a lot of lines of code
15:40 - you could have a lot of things happen
15:41 - within that if statement so those curly
15:43 - brackets say this is the code that
15:45 - should be executed and remember if this
15:46 - evaluates to false this doesn't happen
15:48 - draws looping over and over again it
15:50 - might be true it might not be true so
15:52 - let's run this and see what we get this
15:55 - is very exciting
15:56 - ok where's my mouse I don't know I think
15:59 - it sounded like 50 so we're not there
16:01 - yet
16:01 - okay leaves like 100 150 done 200 ok
16:06 - we're getting they were close it's
16:07 - almost there there oh yes we got it all
16:09 - right so you can see that as the mouse
16:11 - gets beyond 300 that circle turns this
16:14 - purplish-pinkish color when I move the
16:16 - mouse back it's off so this is pretty
16:18 - exciting and you could think like almost
16:20 - have this sense of like making a roll
16:22 - over here I mean we don't at all but you
16:24 - can start to imagine like what's that if
16:26 - statement that says if the mouse is
16:28 - inside the circle highlight it so these
16:32 - are the kinds of things you all these
16:33 - interface elements that you might be
16:35 - used to using on your computer this is
16:37 - how they work and I don't know if I will
16:39 - actually solve this particular problem
16:41 - in a video it involves looking up the
16:43 - distance function because you've got to
16:44 - test the distance of the mouse from the
16:46 - center of that circle but that could be
16:48 - something if you want to have a tricky
16:49 - problem to look at you might sort of see
16:53 - later I'm gonna definitely get to an
16:56 - example that that uses a rectangle try
16:59 - to see if if the mouse is within the
17:00 - bounds of the rectangle I think that's
17:02 - in my mind of future videos so there's
17:06 - one other thing I want to mention just
17:07 - to kind of like make sure this video
17:09 - kind of like wraps itself up and
17:11 - doesn't leave off any details V I showed
17:13 - you these relational operators there are
17:15 - other ones there is greater than n
17:18 - equals
17:19 - there is less than or equals so in other
17:22 - words v is greater than or equals 6 this
17:26 - is actually true
17:27 - no it's not
17:30 - I bet to stay like that's not true v is
17:33 - greater than or equal v right because it
17:35 - is equal it's like I'm like I was doing
17:39 - so well with this video now I'm kind of
17:40 - losing my mind here a little bit so but
17:42 - there are other relational operators
17:43 - that you could use these are probably
17:44 - the most common ones you're gonna get
17:45 - pretty far and then there's also double
17:51 - equals there's a funny distinction
17:54 - between the double equals and a triple
17:55 - equals in JavaScript I'm gonna leave out
17:57 - of this video and just use double equals
17:59 - because the distinction and maybe this
18:03 - is a bad idea I'll have to rerecord this
18:05 - or write something in the video's
18:07 - description but there's a key sort of
18:10 - thing here if I want to check this if
18:13 - Mouse X is equal to 200 I cannot say
18:21 - Mouse X eat I cannot use this as my
18:25 - expression the reason I cannot use this
18:27 - but as my expression is that single
18:28 - equals means an assignment operation
18:31 - meaning I want to assign the value 200
18:33 - to Mouse X which is not something I want
18:35 - to do Mouse X doesn't even get the sign
18:37 - it just picks up the value of where the
18:38 - mouse is so if you want to test
18:40 - different if a variable is equal to
18:42 - something you need to use the double
18:44 - equals and I know maybe 1 when I get two
18:45 - strings that's when I look at the
18:47 - distinction between double equals and
18:49 - triple equals and some might say that
18:51 - you should actually use the triple
18:52 - equals instead of a double equals I
18:54 - really gone off the deep end I really
18:56 - thought about this I wouldn't have
18:57 - mentioned this in the first place
18:58 - so these are some things you look at but
19:00 - honestly this is generally not such a
19:03 - good idea because you know when are you
19:05 - really trying to test if the mouse is on
19:07 - an exact pixel generally you're looking
19:10 - for ranges so and I think what you could
19:13 - get started with is take something you
19:15 - made earlier where something is growing
19:17 - or something is moving according to the
19:19 - mouse and see if you can have a color
19:21 - change or a shape change or something
19:22 - you could do that
19:23 - kind of interesting here's an exercise
19:24 - for you is have this shape change have
19:28 - it be a circle or a square or possibly
19:30 - even is it could you have three
19:31 - possibilities or a triangle depending on
19:33 - where the mouth X is or the mouth Y is
19:35 - that's something you could try doing as
19:37 - a quick little exercise after this video
19:38 - okay
19:39 - this was 11 minutes and 20 seconds which
19:42 - is I've tried to keep these to ten
19:44 - minutes I almost sort of got that and
19:45 - I'm gonna hit stop now and record the
19:47 - next one just stop buttons over here
19:50 - okay okay
19:54 - now hi ever you guys if you're watching
19:56 - this on the livestream anybody is
19:57 - actually still there and pull this up
19:59 - now okay how is that for anybody should
20:08 - if like said that instantly so if
20:10 - anybody has any feedback comments
20:13 - thoughts I'm gonna go straight on to do
20:15 - a quick bouncing ball demonstration will
20:18 - be next so I'm going to start preparing
20:22 - that and if you guys have comments
20:30 - conditionals too and I'm gonna go back
20:36 - to this but I'm gonna have an X I'm
20:41 - gonna say var x equals zero and then x
20:46 - equals x plus three and there we go
20:52 - so this is my next demonstration the
20:54 - circle turning around with an if
20:57 - statement yeah the the yeah I would love
21:03 - to have all of these subtitled I'm
21:05 - thinking of yes some people have
21:09 - volunteered to subtitle and also I'm
21:11 - thinking of using like canonical Turk or
21:13 - five or something just to like pay a
21:15 - little bit of money to help get things
21:16 - up titled but yeah okay anybody have any
21:21 - last feedback I'm gonna give myself a
21:23 - minute to get situated I think it's
21:25 - 10:50 I've still got to take a short
21:27 - break at 11:30 and then I'll start up a
21:29 - new broadcast I'm hoping maybe I can do
21:30 - all these conditionals by 11:30 that I
21:33 - can do the loop ones
21:36 - bouncing ball yeah okay okay I'm going
21:44 - to erase this and I'll get Rick one last
21:56 - time to see if anybody has any feedback
21:59 - excellent thank you it's nice to have
22:02 - nice feedback okay losing my mind in
22:05 - here and okay I'm gonna get started into
22:08 - the next video so I'm gonna close this
22:11 - I really have to remember to turn the
22:13 - air conditioning on when I stop cuz it
22:15 - gets so hot in here
22:18 - okay now we're gonna run this okay I got
22:24 - to clean up this coat a little bit to
22:25 - make it more visible
22:29 - and I also need a good system for
22:32 - figuring out where to put all this code
22:34 - you know I really ultimately my whole
22:36 - plan is to actually record videos in
22:39 - front of this green screen here but have
22:42 - the background not be a video but
22:43 - actually like a live code editor and a
22:45 - canvas but I just didn't have time to
22:49 - get that ready and want to like make all
22:50 - this content and I'll spend a month
22:52 - getting that system right they won't
22:53 - have made any content so that'll be in
22:54 - the future someday who encouraged me to
22:56 - do that or help with that let me know
22:58 - okay so I'm gonna record the next video
23:01 - start over here actually I'm gonna start
23:03 - over here it's gonna start over here
23:05 - okay and here we go
23:09 - hi okay so this is the next video about
23:12 - conditional statements looking at them
23:14 - in JavaScript and with the p5.js library
23:17 - and editor just burps of the start over
23:20 - again and I'm actually gonna have a
23:23 - little sip of some of this
23:32 - exactly I'm like even weirder if there's
23:34 - like not the live stream here fig
23:36 - because I'm like trying a little bit
23:37 - self-conscious to not be so crazy okay
23:41 - this video is a high so I wanna I start
23:48 - too quickly it's okay everything's gonna
23:49 - be fine I'm gonna get this one we get
23:50 - this one what am I gonna say first hi
23:58 - hello okay
24:03 - hi again so in this video I would like
24:06 - to look at a kind of classic problem
24:08 - that comes up in programming graphics
24:10 - when you're first getting started that
24:12 - requires a conditional statement you
24:13 - really need an if statement for this
24:15 - problem and the problem is this so here
24:18 - I have a little bit of an example here
24:19 - we can see there's one variable x equals
24:22 - zero there's a canvas I'm drawing that a
24:24 - circle at that X and X every time
24:26 - through draw is increasing incrementing
24:28 - by three what will the result of that be
24:30 - this circle that moves across the screen
24:32 - and it leaves and it never comes back so
24:36 - the problem that we need to look at here
24:38 - in this particular video is how do we
24:39 - get that circle to turn around and come
24:42 - back okay so I'm gonna come over here
24:44 - for a second and the topic if you just
24:47 - watch the previous video we are looking
24:48 - at conditional statements conditional
24:51 - statements an if statement has this
24:53 - format if open parentheses close
24:55 - parentheses open curly braket close
24:58 - curly bracket and some sort of boolean
25:01 - expression true or false goes in here so
25:07 - let's think about what is the condition
25:09 - that has to be met in order for that
25:12 - circle the ball so to speak to turn
25:14 - around so this is the canvas here is the
25:20 - circle it's moving along if the location
25:24 - of this circle is at the edge that's the
25:28 - condition so if that's the condition for
25:30 - which it should turn around so you might
25:32 - think what's the name of the variable X
25:33 - so if X is equal to width
25:40 - you might think that this is where you
25:43 - want to get started in and this is not
25:44 - completely illegitimate I mean this
25:46 - could work and it's sort of the right
25:48 - idea if the circle location equals the
25:51 - width of the window that's when you want
25:53 - to turn it or turn around why I feel
25:56 - like I want to start this one over again
25:58 - I'm gonna take your gun look it going
25:59 - that's starting over okay so but this
26:02 - this isn't really good think about it
26:04 - first of all I am in in the program that
26:06 - I just showed you X is going up by three
26:08 - each time x equals x plus three goes up
26:11 - by three goes up by three because of by
26:12 - three so if the width of the window is
26:14 - like 200 it might not ever actually X
26:18 - might not ever actually equal 200 it
26:20 - might be at like you know 197 well
26:22 - that'll be at 200 but whatever is
26:23 - divisible by 3 up there near 200 so this
26:27 - isn't really good we need a condition
26:29 - that will no matter what catch that
26:31 - circle before before it goes too far off
26:34 - the screen and if you can think about
26:35 - that a nice condition for that might be
26:37 - if X is greater than you could use
26:39 - greater than or equals but I'm just
26:41 - gonna use greater than if X is greater
26:43 - than with what do something so first
26:48 - let's just make sure this is the right
26:49 - idea
26:50 - so let's come back over here and now we
26:51 - can add high back over here we can add
26:54 - this to this particular program and I'm
26:55 - standing in front of it too much you
26:57 - scooch this over scooch this over that's
26:59 - a little bit better so I'm gonna add if
27:02 - X is greater than width and remember
27:05 - with width is a built-in variable in p5
27:09 - that knows inherently the width of the
27:12 - canvas and where does it get that value
27:14 - it gets it from here it's news I could
27:16 - have put 600 I could put 600 oh no where
27:18 - I'm looking I could have put 600 down
27:20 - there but if I ever change the canvas
27:23 - size its you know then I don't have to
27:24 - change the number elsewhere in the
27:26 - program so using these built-in
27:27 - variables is a useful thing so I'm gonna
27:29 - you know you may not have seen this but
27:31 - I'm gonna add a print statement so
27:35 - something you can always do in p5 is say
27:38 - println which means print line I'm going
27:40 - to print a line down here in the console
27:42 - that's going to say off the screen so we
27:45 - should only see that message print if X
27:48 - is greater than width so let's run this
27:51 - and we can see I don't see the message
27:54 - see the message item see the message I
27:55 - see the message so you can see our if
27:57 - statement works it only triggered
27:59 - printing that as soon as it left the
28:01 - screen so now you have to ask yourself
28:03 - what what's the what's the thing we put
28:06 - there what what do you put there in
28:07 - order to have it to go backwards okay so
28:11 - here's what here's what you might be
28:13 - thinking it's not right here's what you
28:15 - might be thinking if going forwards is x
28:18 - equals x plus 3 then going backwards is
28:21 - maybe x equals x minus 3 right so if X
28:24 - is greater than with then go backwards
28:28 - ok it's going forwards it's going oh
28:31 - hello uh-oh something has happened
28:35 - a camera froze what's being streamed
28:39 - right now hold on sorry this video broke
28:45 - down ah
28:47 - let's try turning this on or huh
28:52 - okay that fixed it uh you know what I
28:55 - didn't really I kind of was like losing
28:56 - my train of thought I could do this
28:58 - whole thing over again uh stop okay I
29:03 - guess that that threw me off too much
29:05 - okay
29:06 - oh that was tragic just don't pick your
29:10 - nose was I picking my nose I don't think
29:13 - that I was okay uh how long was that so
29:19 - far no it was only five minutes well you
29:23 - know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna guess
29:29 - maybe I'll just splice the to I can
29:31 - record again from here and splice the
29:34 - two things together uh maybe I'll try
29:38 - that okay
29:44 - I just okay I like seeing when you guys
29:52 - are gonna see the actual live thing
29:54 - which is like terrible okay I lost my
29:57 - train I thought okay let me minimize
29:58 - this well okay I really want to do this
30:10 - whole no no I'm gonna I'm gonna do it
30:12 - from here
30:12 - I'm gonna have to just put two videos
30:14 - together which I think I can do I can
30:16 - put two videos together okay and here we
30:22 - go record like sorry there was a quick
30:25 - technical mishap of the camera so I'm
30:27 - just kind of picking up where I was
30:28 - before hopefully this will work
30:30 - so running this program you could see
30:33 - what we try to do is I lost mmm yeah no
30:41 - I'm sorry I gotta start over
30:43 - it's so hot in here okay okay stop start
30:53 - again
30:58 - sorry there was a technical mishap but
31:00 - I'm starting from where I was before we
31:02 - were looking at this example where we
31:05 - that and we were evaluating this as a
31:07 - solution if the circle goes past the
31:09 - screen we wanted to go backwards so
31:11 - shouldn't it go instead of by plus three
31:14 - we should decrease X by negative 3
31:17 - subtract 3 from X so if we run this
31:18 - let's see what the result is it's going
31:20 - it's going it's getting to the edge now
31:23 - interestingly enough it doesn't go past
31:24 - the edge anymore
31:25 - but it also doesn't come around and go
31:28 - back so this is where you really have to
31:30 - think about what's going on
31:33 - logically sorry everybody
31:44 - when technical things happen ok try this
31:55 - again okay we're almost where I was
32:01 - basically at the end of this video and I
32:02 - got stuck here ok I can just pick it up
32:05 - from where it was before
32:08 - ok technical mishap but the camera is
32:10 - working again now where were we
32:12 - we were looking at this particular
32:14 - scenario we need to get that circle to
32:18 - turn around we know it's moving to the
32:19 - right because it's increasing by 3 every
32:21 - time through draw so when it gets to the
32:24 - edge it should decrease by 3 X equals X
32:26 - minus 3
32:27 - now this is flawed logic but it sort of
32:29 - has this almost intuitive idea that it
32:31 - might be right but we need to figure out
32:33 - why is it wrong and what's the correct
32:34 - way to do it which will hopefully help
32:36 - you understand about how conditional
32:38 - statements work even more so let me run
32:40 - it and let's see what the problem is so
32:42 - it's moving to the edge now that if
32:45 - statement is true and it moves back by 3
32:47 - but what does it do the next line it
32:49 - moves up by 3 again then it comes around
32:50 - to this draw again is it over the edge
32:52 - yeah move back by 3 and then move up by
32:54 - 3 so this didn't really solve our
32:55 - problem I just moved it back once and
32:58 - then this line of code is still
33:00 - executing what we need to do is figure
33:02 - out a way to permanently have the the
33:06 - circle stop increasing by 3 permanently
33:09 - stop increase this decrease by three we
33:11 - need the certain number three to turn
33:13 - into a negative three for the next many
33:16 - cycles through draw and how do we do
33:18 - that how do you need to do that the way
33:21 - to do that is with a variable so let's
33:22 - look at this again let's say I say if I
33:24 - have a variable speed equals three and
33:27 - then I say x equals x plus speed I'm
33:32 - going to take this out so X is always
33:35 - changing by whatever the value of that
33:37 - variable speed is and when the program
33:39 - starts that speed variable is three it's
33:42 - three it's three it's three is three Oh
33:44 - what do we want it to be willing to turn
33:45 - around what if we made that speed
33:46 - variable negative three now x equals x
33:49 - plus negative three is the equivalent of
33:51 - x equals x minus three so all I need to
33:53 - do here is say speed equals negative
33:57 - three so at a certain moment speed
34:00 - equals negative three and when we get to
34:05 - the edge people differ and it's moving
34:08 - around and knots coming back and goodbye
34:10 - so for you with this exercise you might
34:13 - think about okay what if it's also
34:15 - moving up and down how do you deal with
34:17 - the top and bottom edges how do you deal
34:19 - just with the right and left edge how
34:21 - might you have a change color or change
34:23 - size how could you have other things
34:25 - about the circle change every time it
34:27 - hits boundary maybe it's speeding and
34:30 - changing so each time it hits it starts
34:31 - going faster and faster there are lots
34:33 - of little variations on this that you
34:35 - could try that I might recommend doing
34:37 - to kind of keep playing with this idea
34:39 - of a conditional statement and in the
34:41 - next video what I want to look at is
34:42 - something that is kind of missing here
34:45 - is what if I want to say if it's greater
34:47 - than with do this otherwise do something
34:50 - else so this idea of an else or an else
34:53 - if it's something we need to look at we
34:54 - could also join boolean logic with a and
34:56 - and an or you know if I'm feeling
34:59 - nervous and scared then I don't know
35:03 - don't make videos about programming or
35:06 - if I'm to get the idea and or so those
35:09 - are the things I need to look at in the
35:10 - next video which I will do so I'm gonna
35:13 - hit stop here and
35:16 - you're good enough you're watching it
35:17 - anyway okay
35:18 - okay that was three minutes so I think
35:21 - that was about ten minutes in total I'm
35:24 - gonna open up the chat again if you have
35:26 - any questions video and sound out of
35:29 - sync okay thanks for the comments and
35:38 - feedback everybody I'm gonna start
35:42 - getting ready for the next video
35:44 - erasing the board and thinking about
35:45 - what I'm going to do if you have any
35:46 - questions you ask or any comments like
35:49 - something was missing or something was
35:50 - wrong or let me know hi oh shoot result
36:13 - this is now the part of the livestream
36:15 - where I'm quietly erasing the contents
36:18 - of the whiteboard so I have till 11:30
36:21 - before I'm going to take a short break
36:23 - but I'm actually doing quite well in the
36:25 - next video what I want to look at is
36:28 - else if and else as well as and and or I
36:35 - think I could do that in one sort of
36:38 - silly though maybe I should just make
36:39 - those two shorter videos it's hard to
36:41 - say but I'm trying to keep the
36:43 - conditional logic down to three videos
36:46 - and then I'm going to try to do loops in
36:48 - two videos cuz I'm making less than I
36:51 - used to make okay so what do I need now
36:55 - I want to go back to I want to go back
37:02 - to the first example I had open recent
37:05 - conditionals one
37:12 - okay now I have a editor bug that I want
37:18 - to file the editor should remember the
37:20 - kind of Windows oops I'm not over here
37:23 - sorry the editor should remember the
37:25 - window size and then okay and location
37:29 - let's see move this over so this is what
37:34 - I'm gonna start with this simple example
37:40 - which was doing this and what I might do
37:44 - is yeah I want to do it else and else if
37:50 - so I think the way that could work would
37:54 - be to maybe I'll do the thing with the
37:57 - different shape so depending on where
37:59 - the mouse is like half way or a third of
38:02 - the way I'll do a different shape
38:03 - that'll work
38:04 - so something like yeah I'll just do it
38:11 - in the video I don't need to do it right
38:13 - now okay so I think I'm ready I'm just
38:18 - gonna check see if anybody had anything
38:21 - they wanted to say maybe combine them in
38:25 - case people aren't sure which to use a
38:26 - situation yeah yes I think that's a good
38:29 - idea
38:30 - I'm gonna I'm gonna do it okay thank you
38:32 - okay I'm gonna start recording it now
38:37 - okay so go over here and my stream I'm
38:50 - about to start my topics are else first
38:53 - then else if and then and and or so kind
39:01 - of cover all those can try to make this
39:02 - about 10-ish minutes that's my goal
39:06 - okay first I need to tie my shoe
39:11 - so livestream you're looking at a blank
39:14 - board while I am tying my shoe this is
39:18 - my life I'm talking to myself
39:24 - okay here we go
39:33 - so we've looked now at conditional
39:36 - statements in a couple scenarios one we
39:38 - just looked at making something happen
39:40 - in the code based on where the mouse is
39:42 - and we've also looked at making
39:46 - something happen in the code based on
39:48 - where something that's moving around the
39:49 - screen start over now that's the right
39:54 - idea but I lost my train of thought for
39:56 - a second okay hi so this is the third
40:02 - video in a minute and a quick three
40:04 - video sequence about conditional
40:05 - statements JavaScript using p5.js the
40:09 - library and the editor so what I've
40:11 - looked at so far is what is a okay one
40:17 - more time last time I swear hi so this
40:23 - this is a third video I'm gonna wrap up
40:25 - this discussion about conditional
40:26 - statements in java script and p5.js here
40:29 - so we've looked so far at a conditional
40:31 - statement and what's allowed us to do
40:32 - it's allowed us to have something have
40:36 - the draw loop executes differently
40:38 - depending on something that's happening
40:39 - in the code whether it's where the users
40:41 - mouse is or where a given shape is on
40:44 - the screen it changes direction or
40:46 - changes color this is this has allowed
40:48 - us to create different paths and have
40:49 - the program do different things based on
40:51 - certain conditions that evaluate to
40:52 - either true or false and this is the
40:54 - essential topic here but there are a few
40:57 - additional features to the way that you
41:00 - can work with conditional logic that
41:02 - allow for other possibilities and the
41:04 - first one that I want to show you is
41:05 - just the keyword else so if you think
41:08 - about it you could say if it's very hot
41:11 - you know turn on the air-conditioning
41:13 - and I might add to that statement if
41:16 - it's very hot turn on the
41:17 - air-conditioning otherwise take a nap I
41:21 - don't know why this doesn't make any
41:22 - sense but you get the idea this idea of
41:24 - otherwise else is essentially that
41:26 - otherwise so if I were to say something
41:28 - like if this is what we're familiar with
41:31 - if now sex is greater than 200 if this
41:35 - evaluates to true execute this code and
41:38 - we know that if it's false we don't
41:39 - execute the code that's in here but what
41:41 - about in this other case of otherwise
41:43 - else
41:45 - and otherwise else do this other code so
41:48 - we now created this sort of like
41:51 - sequence nested block we have an open
41:54 - curly bracket and a close curly bracket
41:56 - and then a nut then an else and then
41:58 - another open curly braket in a closed
42:00 - curly bracket
42:01 - so what I want to do is go find that
42:02 - previous example we made where that I
42:04 - made where if the mouse gets over to the
42:07 - right hand side of the screen the the
42:08 - circle turns purple so now I don't want
42:11 - to do is say like if it's on the right
42:12 - hand side of the screen have it draw a
42:14 - circle or change the shape so I'm gonna
42:16 - based on if it's using else that if it's
42:21 - on the right hand side of the screen do
42:22 - this otherwise do this other thing okay
42:24 - so this is where the else comes in so
42:27 - let's look at that syntax now okay over
42:30 - here so we can see this bit of code
42:32 - right here this is where our this is
42:34 - where our if statement is and now I can
42:37 - I want to add an else right here so all
42:39 - I need to do that is type else and add
42:41 - another open curly bracket and actually
42:43 - notice the editor itself just filled in
42:45 - that second curly bracket for me so you
42:47 - can see if this is true do this code and
42:50 - basically what we're saying is if that's
42:51 - not true do this other code and so I
42:54 - could have kept with color but what I'm
42:56 - going to do is I'm going to take this
42:57 - ellipse and put that here and then I'm
43:00 - gonna here I'm going to say draw a
43:02 - rectangle so now we can see and I'm
43:06 - going to zoom back out we can see do
43:10 - this otherwise do that so let's run this
43:12 - code and we can see okay well right now
43:15 - the mouse is not greater than 300 so
43:17 - when it starts were actually X I'm at
43:19 - the program is executing that otherwise
43:21 - statement and ask the mouse moves over
43:23 - we've got the circle so you can see that
43:25 - circle is turning into a square based on
43:28 - where the mouse is we've got this
43:29 - conditional logic okay now there there's
43:32 - more to this than that so in addition to
43:35 - having an else so one thing I should
43:37 - know here is a conditional statement you
43:39 - could only ever have one if and one else
43:43 - but there's something you can put in
43:45 - between there
43:52 - if mouse X is greater than 200 execute
44:01 - this code now I could say otherwise
44:04 - execute some other piece of code but I'm
44:07 - gonna say something different I'm gonna
44:09 - say otherwise if such-and-such else if
44:15 - Mouse X is greater than 100 execute this
44:22 - bit of code else if Mouse X is greater
44:27 - than 50 execute this bit of code in all
44:31 - other cases else execute this bit of
44:35 - code so these if statements can actually
44:38 - become this much longer piece of logic
44:41 - where you're testing a whole bunch of
44:43 - different conditions a kind of classic
44:45 - example of this it doesn't really apply
44:46 - to drawing in p5 but to sort of think of
44:49 - these logic is a program that grades
44:50 - somebody so you could say if the grade
44:53 - is greater than an if the grade is
44:55 - greater than 90 assign the letter grade
44:58 - a otherwise if it's greater than 80
45:00 - assign the letter grade B otherwise if
45:03 - it's greater than 70 C etc so you can
45:06 - imagine there's a bunch of different
45:07 - conditions that were testing and you
45:10 - have to start with it if you don't have
45:12 - to start with an else but you can only
45:13 - have one other otherwise in all other
45:16 - cases and you can have as many else ifs
45:18 - as you want in between so again the this
45:21 - this idea of seeing makes a lot more
45:23 - sense in the context of a practical
45:25 - example and we could look at testing
45:27 - like where the mouse is on the screen is
45:28 - that here or is it here or is it here or
45:30 - is it here which one of these conditions
45:32 - is it met so I want to actually put this
45:35 - in the code but I'm gonna do it in a
45:37 - slightly different way this is actually
45:39 - correct but I'm gonna put I'm gonna
45:41 - start with Mouse X greater than 50 then
45:43 - 100 then 200 and reverse this order and
45:45 - it's not gonna work and I want to also
45:47 - discuss Y which is that's one key aspect
45:49 - about how else--if works so this is a
45:51 - really tricky interesting problem if you
45:53 - haven't seen this before okay so now I'm
45:56 - over here and I'm going to add so I'm
45:58 - gonna start with sorry Mouse I really
46:03 - should have done color here because now
46:04 - I
46:04 - to like think of four shapes but it's
46:06 - fine so if mouse X is greater than fifty
46:09 - a circle else if Mouse X is greater than
46:12 - 150 do a rectangle else if Mouse X is
46:17 - greater than 250 let's do a line and you
46:24 - know what I'm gonna do
46:25 - just because I'm and then in all other
46:27 - cases do a point 300 to 200 okay so now
46:34 - we can see I've strung together this
46:36 - conditional logic and I'm gonna kind of
46:38 - try to zoom into it a little bit to make
46:40 - it a little bigger here you can see okay
46:41 - if the mouse is greater than 50
46:44 - otherwise if it's greater than 150
46:45 - otherwise if it's greater than 250
46:47 - otherwise draw a point so I should see
46:48 - either an ellipse a rectangle a line or
46:51 - a point now this isn't going to work so
46:53 - let's keep your mind churning about why
46:55 - it's not okay so there we go we've got a
46:58 - point which makes sense in all other
47:00 - cases right which is it's not greater
47:02 - than fifty hundred fifty two hundred
47:03 - fifty it's not greater than any of these
47:04 - we should see a point so now when I get
47:07 - to greater than fifty what do we get a
47:09 - circle now I should get to greater than
47:11 - 150 ash of a rectangle or greater than
47:13 - 250 a line so why are these not why are
47:19 - why am I not seeing a rectangular line
47:22 - why why why this is sort of a key key
47:24 - distinction here so one thing that's
47:28 - true about this is that as soon as any
47:32 - one of these evaluates to true the
47:35 - program kicks out of the if statement
47:36 - and goes to the next lines of code that
47:38 - are below that if statement as soon as
47:41 - any one about these evaluates to true it
47:43 - doesn't check the next one so the order
47:46 - of these is very very important only one
47:48 - of these sections of code can be
47:50 - executed not more than one if you want
47:53 - more than one to be executed there's a
47:54 - different way of doing it which I'll
47:56 - mention the afterwards but for a
47:58 - conditional saying this is one whole
48:00 - statement where if is joined with else
48:02 - if else if and else only one of these
48:04 - can be evaluated so let's go back to
48:06 - here and look at this again let's think
48:09 - about if mouse X has the value of 275
48:12 - well in our minds what we want to
48:14 - it is 275 is greater than 250 so we
48:17 - should see that line but let's now let's
48:20 - be the computer for a second and go
48:21 - through this logic mouse X is 275 is 275
48:25 - greater than 50 yes it's true it is
48:29 - greater than 250 so an ellipse is drawn
48:31 - and I'll remember as soon as the first
48:33 - thing evaluates to true we kick out of
48:35 - that and go to the end so none of these
48:37 - others are checked so the order of this
48:39 - really matters if I have just checked if
48:41 - it was greater than 250 first then I
48:43 - would have found that one right the
48:44 - order here really really is really
48:46 - important so in this just in this
48:48 - particular scenario the way that I've
48:50 - written this code I need to check 250
48:52 - then 150 then 50 and we can run this
48:55 - program and we should see first we're
48:57 - starting with a point then we get a line
48:59 - then we get a square and put these kind
49:01 - of close together than a circle so based
49:03 - on where the mouse is a different shape
49:05 - is drawn so this is a really sort of
49:07 - crucial piece of information as to how
49:09 - these if statements work oh okay so now
49:16 - it is true however that I could also I
49:19 - hesitate to do this but I could write
49:22 - this with it not being without these
49:25 - else so if I take out these else but
49:29 - leave maybe and I'm gonna the else ifs
49:31 - I'm going to take out this one just
49:33 - three separate if statements let's look
49:35 - at what happens now you try to think to
49:38 - yourself like what's gonna happen here
49:40 - so I'm gonna run this I've got a line
49:42 - I've got a I now I see all three of
49:44 - those so these now are not related to
49:47 - each other
49:47 - they're just three distinct if
49:48 - statements on their own so when the
49:50 - mouse is 275 it's greater than 250 and
49:52 - greater than 150 and greater than 50 so
49:55 - all of these occur however if I string
49:57 - them together with that else right then
50:00 - as soon as the first one is executed the
50:03 - next one is not checked so these are
50:05 - essentially the tools you have to work
50:06 - with and it really depends what it is
50:08 - you want to implement okay so there's
50:11 - one other tool thank you my watch almost
50:16 - a 10 minutes here which is about the
50:17 - length I'm trying to keep these videos
50:18 - there's one other tool that I want to
50:20 - add to this video which is and and/or so
50:26 - let's look at this here
50:29 - another thing that you can add into a
50:36 - conditional statement is an and or an or
50:38 - so imagine if you said something like
50:41 - this if mouse X is greater than 50 and
50:46 - now this is incorrect syntax so I'm just
50:49 - going to write the word
50:50 - and here for a second and mouse X is
50:54 - less than 100 I kind of write what does
50:58 - this mean if this is the canvas and this
51:02 - is pixel 50 and this is pixel 100 what
51:10 - is + Mouse X so when does this evaluate
51:14 - to true well this evaluates to true
51:16 - anytime the mouse is greater than 50
51:19 - this evaluates to true anytime the mouse
51:23 - is less than 100 both of these together
51:26 - the whole statement only evaluates to
51:28 - true if both of those are true which is
51:30 - all the area in here you can think of it
51:32 - as the intersection so with an and if
51:35 - you join two boolean expressions with an
51:37 - and they both have to evaluate to true
51:39 - in order for in order for the the code
51:46 - here for the full statement to evaluate
51:48 - to true now you could also have an or
51:51 - here if you put an or here only one of
51:56 - these needs to evaluate to true in order
51:59 - for this whole in order for the this
52:03 - code to evaluate this this this code to
52:05 - be executed for this to evaluate to true
52:06 - so let's think about this if Mouse X is
52:10 - greater than 50 or it's less than 100
52:12 - well guess what that's every number
52:14 - that's ever been invented or talked
52:16 - about ever in the history of the
52:17 - universe of numbers right because try to
52:20 - come up with a number that either
52:22 - greater than 50 or less than 100 every
52:24 - number 2 is less than 150 7 is greater
52:27 - than 50 171 is greater than 50 so so
52:31 - this is kind of like not so into the
52:32 - logical statement but it makes a lot of
52:34 - sense with an ant now the one thing that
52:37 - I'll mention here is even though I'm
52:39 - using the word
52:40 - and an or this is not actually the
52:42 - syntax so the syntax for writing an and
52:45 - into your code is two ampersands and the
52:49 - syntax for writing an or into your code
52:51 - is two pipes pipe pipe ampersand
52:56 - ampersand so I want to go now and I'm
53:00 - gonna go down and make two quick
53:02 - examples I'm going to add an end to our
53:04 - mouth X example and I'm going to add an
53:06 - or to our bouncing ball example you'll
53:08 - see how both of those work okay so over
53:12 - here what I would like to do now is I'm
53:15 - gonna go back and I'm just gonna make a
53:18 - rectangle which is that 300 200 100 100
53:22 - and I'm going to say if Mouse X is
53:25 - greater than 200 and mouse X is less
53:28 - than 300 so look at this
53:31 - if Mouse X is greater than 200 and less
53:34 - than 300 let's see what that results in
53:38 - whoops I would sorry I'm gonna draw the
53:41 - rectangle always and I'm going to change
53:45 - the fill color if this evaluates to true
53:49 - okay so look at this the mouth it's no
53:53 - it's not greater than 200 right now or
53:54 - okay whoops how come
53:57 - oh sorry I did that wrong I want it to
54:00 - be greater than 300 and a little less
54:03 - than 400 sorry about that my math was
54:06 - off see look if the mouse is over the
54:09 - rectangle it's turning purple otherwise
54:11 - it's not of course if I'm up here also
54:14 - you can see as long as it's in between
54:16 - this side of the rectangle and the other
54:18 - side of the rectangle that fill is
54:20 - executed so what I might say to you as
54:22 - an exercise is can you add some more
54:24 - hands to check if mouse Y is greater
54:27 - than the top and less than the bottom
54:29 - and this would be the code for a roll
54:31 - over here so one of the things you're
54:33 - going to see as we work with p5.js more
54:36 - and more and more is that a lot of the
54:40 - is that we're going to eventually be
54:42 - able to get a lot of this stuff for free
54:44 - like we're in the browser I'm working in
54:46 - the browser there's rollovers there's
54:47 - buttons there's all sorts of things but
54:49 - as you started to learn to pro
54:51 - and just drawing shapes kind of raw
54:53 - shapes working with the pixels getting
54:54 - your hands dirty with the pixels in the
54:56 - canvas you might take some time like try
54:58 - to program a rollover try to program a
55:00 - button that's actually something I need
55:03 - a video about something about checking
55:04 - if the mouse is pressed anyway this is
55:07 - because there's much other content here
55:09 - that I realized I need to make so but
55:13 - this is can get you started so try to
55:15 - make some rollovers can you put more
55:16 - than one on the screen can you get them
55:17 - to change different colors try things
55:20 - like that I want to look very quickly at
55:22 - an or and so I'm going to go back also
55:27 - to my other example and remember this
55:31 - example where the ball gets to the right
55:38 - and turns around and goes back when am i
55:40 - doing that I'm doing that if X is
55:42 - greater than width so what I want to say
55:44 - now is if X gets to the right side turn
55:47 - around or if it gets to the left side
55:49 - turn around so what's the left side if
55:51 - the right side is greater than with the
55:54 - Lexx left side is or if X is greater
55:56 - than zero and by the way what's another
55:59 - way I can take right one when it gets to
56:02 - the right I want speed to become
56:03 - negative three when it gets to the left
56:06 - I want speed to become positive three so
56:08 - negative 3 positive 3 negative 3
56:10 - positive 3 what's a way you can change a
56:13 - number from positive to negative to
56:14 - positive to negative to positive is
56:16 - negative always just multiply it by
56:18 - negative 1 so if I take speed and said
56:21 - equal to itself times negative 1 what
56:24 - you will see here is speed is 3 and now
56:29 - speed is negative 3 and now when it gets
56:32 - to the left side up speed is positive 3
56:34 - name so now you have this circle that's
56:36 - just bouncing back and forth so this is
56:38 - again something you might start to play
56:39 - with with this example further
56:41 - top and bottom changing size changing
56:43 - color can you have more than one circle
56:45 - on the screen which is a little bit
56:47 - tricky right now because we haven't used
56:48 - we haven't looked at an array yet which
56:50 - is a list of things but but that so this
56:52 - kind of fills in some gaps and in my
56:54 - mind I've thought of a lot of other gaps
56:56 - with conditional logic that hopefully is
56:59 - helping you here okay I'm going to stop
57:02 - this video and I'm I might make one more
57:04 - thought of a couple other things that I
57:05 - wanted to mention about conditional
57:07 - logic and then I also need to make some
57:10 - videos about loops okay oops
57:15 - stop okay okay I'm coming back to the
57:18 - live stream and missed it yes and yes
57:29 - thank you for these okay I have a
57:30 - spammer here I wonder if I can flag the
57:33 - spammer remove okay okay so thank you
57:47 - guys for whoops oh no that was just me
57:50 - frozen in his face
57:53 - thank you guys for listening to this
57:55 - live broadcast I'm actually going to
57:57 - like stop and start in again in about 15
58:00 - minutes I'm gonna do more videos I'll
58:01 - just make this a new broadcast and
58:03 - hopefully I'll have fixed that mono ear
58:05 - thing so if you want to tune back in
58:08 - again you're welcome to although I would
58:10 - understand if you didn't want to high
58:13 - antonius so I had 20 asleep just arrived
58:16 - but I just have to go and I feel like a
58:18 - quick thing I have to do it 11:30 and
58:21 - then I'm gonna be back but I think
58:23 - there's no way to continue the same live
58:25 - broadcast so I'm going to start up a new
58:26 - one which is fine because this one's
58:27 - been going on for an hour already I'm
58:29 - gonna turn the air conditioning up and
58:32 - then I turned the lights off to get a
58:34 - little cooler in here and I will I'm
58:36 - like mmm it's like whole inception thing
58:38 - is to making me crazy and I will see you
58:40 - again in a little bit so I'm shutting
58:41 - off the stream which I need to do by
58:44 - going to live control room and stop
58:47 - streaming thank you guys I'll be back
58:49 - I'll post something on Twitter I guess
58:51 - if that's where you want to follow or I
58:53 - probably just go to my YouTube page will
58:55 - show up again it's like another live
58:56 - event and I will see you guys soon okay
58:59 - stop streaming
