00:00 - *train whistle* hello welcome to a Q&A video I'm
00:03 - going to talk in this video about what
00:05 - is the difference between p5.js and
00:06 - processing, i'm probably in a moment going to say
00:08 - exactly that same thing, because I'm actually
00:10 - just after the fact recording an intro
00:12 - because I went on for so long i decided
00:14 - to drop to divide this particular
00:16 - discussion into three parts. so the first
00:19 - part i'm just going to kind of talk
00:21 - about those real bigger picture of these
00:23 - two different environments and what
00:24 - programming languages they're built on
00:25 - and kind of how that plays a role in
00:28 - their features and ways that you work
00:31 - with them and I'll diagram that on the
00:33 - whiteboard the second part i'll actually
00:34 - show the two different environments and
00:36 - type some code side-by-side and look at
00:38 - the editors and see some pieces of that
00:40 - and in the third part i will make a list
00:43 - of pros and cons of why you might want
00:45 - to use one versus the other or where
00:47 - one environment excel over the other
00:49 - environment and as well as take some
00:52 - questions from the live chat about
00:54 - things that I missed
00:55 - so that's going to be three videos if
00:57 - you find them interesting please watch
00:59 - them if you kind of don't please don't
01:01 - watch them and offer you maybe in the
01:03 - second part *train whistle*
01:04 - hello welcome to a coding train Q&A
01:06 - video in this video I'm going to answer
01:08 - a question that I get a lot about the
01:11 - project the software projects that are
01:13 - maintained by something called the
01:14 - processing foundation the processing
01:16 - foundation was founded in 2012
01:18 - its mission is to promote software
01:20 - literacy within the visual arts and
01:21 - beneficial literacy within technology
01:23 - related fields and I would say
01:25 - primarily also to make these fields
01:28 - make this more accessible to diverse
01:29 - communities and i encourage you to read
01:31 - more about the processing foundation's
01:32 - initiatives and projects and mission, all
01:35 - on the process foundation website but
01:37 - I'm not here to talk about the processing
01:38 - foundation in this video because i have
01:40 - this habit of doing that all the time
01:42 - the question that i get a lot and this
01:44 - question comes from someone named
01:47 - shiffman ok so i posted this question
01:48 - but it's only because people tweet and email it to me all the time
01:51 - but you can actually ask your own
01:53 - questions here other github repository
01:55 - in the issues which I'll link to in this
01:56 - video's description but the question
01:58 - here is what is the difference between
02:00 - p5.js and processing and the last time I
02:03 - tried to make a video you'll see it in
02:04 - this playlist answering the question I
02:07 - really went into the history
02:08 - of these projects and why they
02:09 - exist and the philosphy and
02:11 - principles behind them in and some
02:13 - differences in that extent
02:15 - but i didn't really get to what I think is
02:16 - important and on a lot of people's minds
02:18 - which is the technical differences
02:20 - what are the
02:22 - underlying programming languages behind
02:24 - these environments
02:25 - what kind of editors can i use with
02:27 - these environments what kind of projects
02:29 - what kind of features do they have
02:30 - whats the difference between
02:31 - the syntax and features of both
02:34 - of these frameworks and that's what I
02:36 - want to discuss in this particular video
02:39 - ok so I'm gonna come over here to the
02:41 - whiteboard for a second, hi! I'm over
02:43 - here at the whiteboard now
02:47 - so here's the thing, processing and p5.js
02:50 - are I would say open source
02:53 - frameworks software projects that are
02:58 - kind of broad projects that involve
03:00 - different aspects and so each one let's
03:03 - think about each one as sort of
03:06 - three categories so each one of these
03:09 - projects is all three of these things
03:12 - if some ways, a library
03:14 - they're built on top of a programming
03:17 - language and then for each one of these
03:21 - that you might use you need someplace
03:23 - where you would sort of type your code
03:24 - and figure out how to use it an editor
03:26 - so let's think about these three
03:29 - categories for a second so p5 and
03:34 - processing let's start with processing
03:37 - so processing is built is written is a
03:41 - library for so these are really kind of
03:44 - one thing
03:47 - it's really not three, it's really two.
03:51 - processing is a library
03:53 - for the java programming language
03:58 - the library, the things that processing
03:59 - is adding or building on top of, or
04:01 - giving you features for are things
04:04 - like drawing data hardware
04:10 - sound
04:17 - so maybe this is a good way of thinking about it
04:18 - and maybe I could add more things here
04:20 - so it's a library
04:21 - meaning it's really ultimately what it
04:24 - is one of the aspects of it if the
04:25 - library of code that you can call
04:27 - functions from, it's built on top of the
04:30 - java programming language, there is an
04:33 - editor for processing which I'll
04:39 - say is like a desktop editor
04:41 - so processing has a desktop editor
04:44 - that you can download and use.
04:48 - the language that p5 is written in and that
04:51 - it is a library for is JavaScript and it
04:58 - has libraries also for drawing and data
05:02 - and sound
05:06 - and hardware but I could keep
05:09 - going with this list, but the primary
05:11 - thing that i might add here HTML CSS or
05:16 - maybe more importantly Dom.
05:19 - because it's javascript,
05:21 - and i'll get to this in a bit more
05:23 - there's a big component of p5
05:26 - involving the web, so now where do you
05:30 - create projects using p5? Here is the thing:
05:33 - processing which is a project that
05:36 - started in 2001, in 2001 if
05:42 - you wanted to write and compile and this
05:44 - is a sort of an aspect to this as well and
05:46 - create software sketches you would need
05:50 - a code editor most code editors were
05:53 - difficult to download install maybe you
05:55 - need to use command line if you're just
05:57 - using a text editor you have this big
05:58 - giant complex environment like eclipse
06:01 - so processing really the idea of
06:05 - processing being an editor is really
06:08 - fundamental to the project you download
06:10 - this editor you open it up and you type
06:13 - code in it you hit 'play' or a run button
06:15 - you see the result of your code,
06:18 - 'E-Z peasy' so to speak so just as much at
06:22 - processing is both a library with all
06:24 - this functionality a place to call
06:26 - those functions
06:27 - in an editor in very fundamental to the
06:29 - project. p5 in many ways that's a little
06:33 - bit less the case because of the world
06:36 - that we live in now and where you can
06:38 - program for the web you know name your
06:41 - favorite editor everybody has their you
06:43 - can use added more supply more brackets
06:46 - are codependent some of these are
06:47 - web-based better just knowing their
06:48 - desktop editors you can just have a you
06:51 - can just use any text editor you can run
06:52 - a server so there's all the fishes left
06:55 - a little bit less of a fundamental piece
06:58 - of the project out there was and I'm
07:00 - gonna make a separate video about this i
07:01 - think there was a p5 jas desktop editor
07:05 - that we modeled after the processing one
07:09 - of many similarities many differences as
07:12 - well because ideas that simple thing you
07:13 - downloaded tiger code you press the play
07:15 - button you see the result
07:17 - this has now been deprecated hopefully a
07:20 - desktop editor will come back at some
07:21 - point in lieu of developing an entire
07:25 - web page editor so their website editor
07:27 - is currently in development there's no
07:29 - public release of it yet but certainly
07:30 - when its release
07:31 - I hope to have people who are working on
07:34 - it comes and presented on the youtube
07:35 - channel
07:36 - Kathy target charts are occasions is
07:39 - that is the lead developer of the People
07:42 - vs web editor and the work that she is
07:43 - doing is just but not else i'm very
07:46 - excited to the point that will be able
07:47 - to have that a public relief if there's
07:49 - no this is not a new idea there are many
07:52 - web-based editors symbol code pen
07:54 - jsfiddle these are places where you just
07:56 - go to your web browser you see a place
07:59 - where you can type in code and you can
08:00 - see the result of the code you could say
08:01 - that you could share it
08:02 - this is very powerful so while there are
08:05 - a lot of options for web editors that
08:06 - you can use we have decided to try to
08:09 - make one that's kind of geared towards
08:11 - people GS specifically and highly
08:13 - tailored to a beginner so if you are a
08:16 - teacher and you've got the group of you
08:18 - know ninth graders on Saturday afternoon
08:20 - for a couple hours you want to teach
08:21 - them the beginning of learning to code
08:23 - what would be the easiest way to do it
08:25 - open up the browser everybody sign up
08:26 - for an account type in your code hit
08:28 - play save share that's kind of mp5 yes
08:30 - to all the libraries are configured and
08:31 - set up for you
08:32 - that's kind of a goal of this this
08:34 - particular web editor
08:35 - project so this is the landscape between
08:38 - these two things so now here i think it
08:44 - is worth exploring for a second and then
08:46 - i'm going to them kind of 102 things
08:48 - going to do is just show you these two
08:49 - environments and like make the same
08:51 - program in both of them to see
08:52 - highlights of differences and then I
08:54 - also want to make a list of pros and
08:55 - cons of why you like you want to use one
08:57 - versus the other but let's let's spend a
09:00 - minute here on Java and JavaScript and I
09:04 - don't like to say versus just put a
09:06 - little heart because i love you by the
09:08 - way people think java is like not a
09:10 - thing anymore but it's used so widely
09:13 - and people don't like job but i like all
09:16 - programming languages it's the place
09:18 - that you can write some code and express
09:20 - yourself and make something interesting
09:21 - it's a good place to be might not be
09:22 - your favorite but let's not be so mean
09:25 - about java so Java is a programming
09:29 - language i think it was started in 1991
09:32 - but really more formally launched
09:33 - probably 1995 everyone in the comments
09:35 - can correct me here if you walk up and
09:38 - the idea of java the big exciting thing
09:42 - about java was write once run anywhere i
09:47 - think with the acronym write once run
09:50 - anywhere anywhere
09:51 - whoa Rob war up at the Royce didn't have
09:55 - like a good ring to it but um the idea
09:57 - is if you were writing your code and C
10:00 - or C++ you would have to rewrite your
10:03 - code entirely if you move from a apple
10:06 - computer to a windows computer to a
10:08 - linux machine to a mobile phone to a
10:10 - toaster and the idea of java the magic
10:13 - was you didn't actually write code that
10:16 - native to that computer you wrote code
10:18 - is very generic way and then there you
10:21 - would have something on that computer
10:23 - called a java virtual machine so as long
10:27 - as the Java Virtual Machine was part of
10:29 - this device then your java code could
10:32 - run on it the Java Virtual Machines
10:34 - essentially job is to translate your
10:35 - java code which turns into java bytecode
10:39 - to that machine specific machine code so
10:43 - this is what it was exciting and
10:46 - powerful innovation and java really
10:49 - adopt most of the same syntax as c++ and
10:54 - it was also highly object-oriented
10:56 - language for better or worse it can be
10:59 - very very wordy and tedious and kind of
11:03 - ugly in many ways are beautiful and
11:05 - elegant depending on how you look at it
11:07 - but what processing a lot of what
11:08 - processing did with java is when you're
11:11 - working in its desktop environment a lot
11:13 - of the rapper code to sort of extra code
11:16 - you need to put the beginning and end of
11:17 - every program in java probably can add
11:20 - for you behind the scenes so that makes
11:22 - it a little bit simpler and some people
11:24 - think of it wasn't really java it's it's
11:26 - because it or is it but it really is
11:29 - java however you are allowed to a not
11:33 - have to live by this like very formal
11:35 - object-oriented way of thinking although
11:36 - you can of course two objects and you
11:38 - don't need all of this extra java stuff
11:40 - that looks very intimidating and
11:42 - upsetting in a way on your like first
11:44 - day looking to program to have that
11:45 - handle this computer stuff that you know
11:47 - what it means
11:48 - so that's really what's going up what
11:49 - happened profit now processing was also
11:52 - in this is what I spent a lot of time in
11:53 - my previous video check i'll try not to
11:55 - harp on too much here
11:56 - java made sense because they could
11:59 - connect to a lot of hardware and
12:00 - librarian for data and networking but it
12:02 - also at the time there was something
12:04 - called applet which were part of early
12:07 - browser's javascript in many ways with
12:10 - need to to complement the fact that
12:13 - JavaScript might be a programming
12:14 - language of the browser that would
12:15 - complement applets but a way of running
12:17 - your profit pitches in 2001 when process
12:21 - of creating that export to Annapolis and
12:22 - share it on the web can't do that so
12:24 - much anymore so the JavaScript of
12:26 - actually what kind of struck started
12:29 - being developed around the same time a
12:31 - little bit after it had other names like
12:33 - mocha and maybe like live script because
12:38 - and netscape and various companies that
12:42 - were developed organizations that were
12:43 - developing early browsers realized you
12:46 - needed something to that you could write
12:48 - code right in the
12:50 - browser in your HTML in your file to
12:52 - like control the behavior and logical
12:54 - things that are happening on a webpage
12:55 - and that's where javascript came from
12:57 - now javaScript obviously is very
12:59 - different now
13:01 - in what year is that 2017 of that it was
13:06 - back then that there's been many
13:09 - different specifications for the
13:10 - language there's there's an organization
13:12 - called ICI ma is that when they were on
13:18 - version like there's like es6 and early
13:21 - term i haven't adopted the new syntax of
13:24 - my video tutorials of JavaScript just
13:26 - yet i can pick your very life doctor to
13:29 - get to show you the environment but but
13:31 - but but still it's quite different but
13:36 - it still is fundamentally the language
13:39 - of the browser a key difference however
13:41 - is that while this is compiled code you
13:44 - have to write your code and then run it
13:47 - through a process that converts it into
13:48 - you know zeros and ones that can be
13:50 - executed an application javascript
13:53 - doesn't work that way
13:54 - javascript is what's known as an
13:56 - interpreted language meaning the browser
13:59 - just read your code and executed at the
14:01 - same time which allows for a lot of
14:03 - flexibility and exciting things like
14:05 - live coding or changing code apply
14:07 - running it typing your code in the
14:08 - browser getting rest there's all sorts
14:10 - of possibilities that you can explore
14:12 - because it's interpreter on the fly and
14:14 - can change as it's running over time as
14:17 - opposed to send it to be compiled and
14:19 - finished but and so invested these are
14:21 - very different programming languages the
14:23 - name is just there because of this thing
14:25 - that applicants were there and
14:27 - JavaScript supposed to complement that
14:29 - and so but added some of the syntax for
14:32 - a while is the same but the actual
14:35 - quality of the language of JavaScript
14:37 - ism do more functions are a job
14:40 - everything about object
14:42 - javascript is that can be object is
14:43 - underrated but functions that sort of
14:45 - this primary thing and this left of can
14:47 - do want to that of course but that sort
14:49 - of the primary think so p 5ks is just a
14:53 - library for JavaScript so if you are
14:55 - quoting full learning p5 yes what you're
14:58 - learning to program in java script
15:00 - and the library of functions that you're
15:02 - calling to maybe draw or do things come
15:04 - from p5 yes if you are learning
15:06 - processing your learning the syntax of
15:09 - the java programming language and how it
15:10 - works and getting access to all these
15:12 - libraries from profits to draw and do
15:14 - that type of thing so and in truth at
15:17 - least in my experience people say well I
15:20 - don't want to use the framework because
15:21 - i really want to learn the with a real
15:22 - big
15:23 - well guess what the real thing is
15:25 - learning how to use different framework
15:27 - so if you learn how to use P by jet
15:29 - maybe you'll learn how to use 3jf RP
15:31 - production or a no matter chance or fill
15:36 - in the blanks doctor is different
15:37 - libraries in different framework for the
15:39 - languages
15:40 - ok so that's kind of a rather
15:41 - long-winded summary of all this and what
15:44 - I want to do now is just show you the
15:46 - two different environments and house
15:48 - intact looks between them and then make
15:50 - a lift of pros and cons between the two
