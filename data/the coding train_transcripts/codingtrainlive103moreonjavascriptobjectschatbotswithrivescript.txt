00:01 - coating train Friday afternoon take two
00:06 - okay so let's see here um you guys hear
00:11 - me am I here am I not frozen is this
00:14 - actually the coding train how's my
00:19 - volume what better way to test my volume
00:22 - then reading some random numbers
00:39 - fifty-one thousand and seven eighty
00:43 - thousand seven hundred and thirty-four
00:47 - 7258 74 thousand seven hundred
00:51 - twenty-eight the volume sounds great now
00:54 - wonderful how's the balance between me
00:57 - and the music because it's Friday off
01:02 - the coding train and I'm talking into a
01:04 - microphone with music playing alright
01:21 - let us begin what are you watching just
01:25 - a strange corner of the internet it is
01:26 - true is what you are watching but my
01:29 - name is Dan Schiffman I am here every
01:30 - Friday and I have this like plan where
01:33 - maybe possibly I might also be here on
01:35 - other days of the week sometimes working
01:37 - on that
01:37 - stay tuned for 2018 which is another
01:40 - year after this year I also know from
01:43 - many of you that I've heard that the
01:45 - time that it is now which is
01:46 - approximately 3:45 Eastern Daylight Time
01:48 - it's the middle of a night for you or at
01:51 - least of the time that you're going to
01:52 - bed and I apologize for that I know that
01:54 - last week I did livestream in the
01:55 - morning my time which a lot of you
01:57 - enjoyed and some of you wasn't as
01:59 - convenient for so I will try to as much
02:01 - as I should probably actually set a
02:03 - specific time I will also try to vary
02:04 - the time using my handy random numbers
02:09 - all right I'm looking the balances fine
02:12 - the music could be louder I turned it
02:14 - down
02:15 - that's exciting to know all right so I
02:21 - am so this is the thing you would think
02:24 - that if only I had the time to like
02:28 - arrive here in this room in the morning
02:30 - and look through some stuff and makes
02:31 - them to-do lists and think about things
02:34 - and answer questions and make a plan
02:36 - that this would be an organized helpful
02:39 - useful livestream about learning to code
02:43 - unfortunately what happens to me is I'm
02:45 - like around doing this and this turning
02:48 - out to this email got on this thing on
02:49 - the table and then I just become this
02:51 - room then none of the equipment works
02:52 - and I'm trying to remember which button
02:54 - to press and I'm live streaming I
02:55 - realized like I have no idea no idea
02:57 - what my plan is but I have to keep
02:59 - talking because of that I said we'll be
03:00 - dead air but actually this is video so
03:07 - if I'm silent and I just move perhaps
03:11 - it's fine low music so I'm looking at
03:16 - the chat don't turn the music louder do
03:18 - you Dan do you like Lady gaga you know
03:22 - Lady Gaga I believe let me we shouldn't
03:23 - graduate particularly she was a student
03:25 - here at Tisch at one point maybe she's
03:26 - in the hallway
03:33 - this is a hallway fresh air comes in
03:38 - from the hallway there is sunlight
03:40 - through the windows in the hallway but
03:42 - instead I'll just close this door and be
03:46 - in this strange this is by the way a
03:48 - storage closet I am in a storage closet
03:50 - with some file cabinets where some
03:52 - cameras and desks and computer equipment
03:54 - have haphazardly been set up
03:56 - oh and I've got the glare thing again so
03:58 - let's see if I can just set this light
03:59 - let me move this light okay all right so
04:04 - here I obtained you guys is the light
04:05 - okay this looks it looks I look very
04:07 - dark I will start doing something at
04:09 - some point let me try to fix this light
04:12 - I feel like kind of like extra dark I
04:15 - should you know I should probably do
04:17 - this before I start live streaming right
04:20 - this is not going very well
04:22 - there we go it's a little bit better
04:25 - okay oh oh that's me over here okay now
04:28 - I'm coming back alright so I actually
04:31 - have some stuff that I want to cover
04:32 - today what do I want to do so last week
04:36 - I should do some like introductory like
04:38 - stuff about what this is but I mean I'll
04:40 - get to that in a second last week I
04:42 - started introducing the topic of
04:45 - object-oriented programming with classes
04:47 - in es6 javascript everybody was just
04:52 - waiting to hear about that's what they
04:55 - wanted to spend their day hearing about
04:56 - so I want to continue that I'm slowly
05:00 - making my way through many videos from
05:02 - my introduction to JavaScript
05:04 - programming course that used a previous
05:08 - style of creating objects using a
05:10 - constructor function and I'd like to
05:12 - redo all those videos so I'm gonna at
05:13 - least try to do two or three do two or
05:15 - three of those videos today so I'll try
05:16 - to get a little further with that and
05:18 - introduce arrays with objects I also
05:21 - have been teaching recently about chat
05:25 - BOTS so I have a little presentation
05:29 - that I meant to look at before I got
05:32 - here I want to talk about chat BOTS and
05:34 - program a simple chat bot using p5.js in
05:38 - the browser browser by chat bot I mean
05:40 - just like a computer program that talks
05:42 - to you with text
05:43 - and so that can mean so many different
05:46 - things there's so many different
05:47 - frameworks and I will get to that sort
05:49 - of stuff at some point I eventually whoa
05:55 - there's a little bit hold on a sec don't
05:58 - want to get water as you know on the
06:03 - Kotick train it's always important to
06:06 - stay hydrated
06:07 - however this water bottle which is
06:10 - producing a lot of condensation right
06:12 - now this is very near the electronic
06:14 - equipment so let me deal with that
06:22 - you're watching a person drinking water
06:24 - on the Internet that's what you're doing
06:25 - right now you realize that right there
06:36 - was a point oh yes this was gonna be a
06:38 - prop Alexa what's the weather today
06:46 - oh okay what hey Google is this thing on
06:58 - [Music]
07:00 - computer make me a vegan turkey sandwich
07:05 - it's not working so I think I have to
07:07 - get an actual Alexa or something like
07:09 - that up here I will try to do that
07:11 - there's a sort of a weird problem where
07:12 - the flexible connect to the NYU Wi-Fi so
07:16 - to figure that out I want to work on
07:17 - doing a coding challenge building an
07:19 - Alexa skill but before I get to that I
07:21 - want to try to use some just free and
07:22 - open source tools to make a chatbot and
07:25 - have computer talk to you with speech to
07:28 - text or text to speech wherever that
07:29 - thing is okay so that's on my list for
07:37 - today let's see what else this has been
07:45 - a rough week what are some things I went
07:48 - about oh whoa I'm so excited I got to
07:50 - talk about a couple things so first of
07:51 - all you are watching the coding train
07:53 - for more information about the coding
07:55 - drain you can
07:56 - to the coding train calm look at that
07:59 - look the coding trains currently live
08:04 - there I am I don't think he can hear
08:09 - that though so so things that you can do
08:15 - if you want to support the work that I'm
08:17 - doing is you can subscribe
08:19 - apparently YouTube likes it or they give
08:21 - you something they give you stuff when
08:22 - people subscribe to your channel like
08:26 - silver things to hang on your wall you
08:29 - can become a patron which is a way of a
08:32 - crowdfunding system to support the work
08:34 - that I'm doing and I am using those
08:35 - funds to hopefully make more videos and
08:38 - do more things in the future that's
08:40 - something you can do you could also help
08:44 - me figure out how to make this website
08:45 - nicer look at this this is kind of great
08:48 - I've done this stick before with the
08:50 - thing and live and the same time it's
08:52 - going back and forth please more volume
08:55 - so that's one thing I wanted to say now
08:59 - one of the things that I've discovered
09:01 - recently on the coding train is the Hat
09:05 - there's this whole community of people
09:07 - out there make watching and making stuff
09:09 - and me I am so me has come on board to
09:13 - help me manage some community projects
09:15 - where people could contribute code and
09:17 - apparently it's like hack tober fest I
09:20 - actually don't know what that is I
09:21 - should know what that is
09:22 - I guess that's run by a digital ocean
09:24 - and I think that if you do something
09:28 - where it's like at least four pull
09:30 - requests or something you can get a
09:32 - t-shirt so anyway I don't know if you're
09:34 - interested in participating in this hack
09:36 - Tober fest you could consider
09:38 - contributing to one of these community
09:39 - projects now community projects what are
09:41 - these I'm very excited to report that
09:43 - the coding train twelve O'Clock project
09:47 - which is a project inspired by hold on a
09:56 - sec I just google to find things because
09:58 - I'm so unprepared by John Maeda
10:01 - world-renowned artist extraordinaire
10:03 - John Midas 1990s work making these
10:08 - twelve
10:10 - clock designs this is an art piece
10:12 - that's in the permanent collection of
10:13 - MoMA and it only works on an OS 9
10:16 - machine so Golan Levin who teaches a
10:19 - class at carnegie mellon it would spy
10:21 - helped inspire this clock challenge put
10:24 - up this documentation of these animated
10:25 - gifts he got the the clocks to run on an
10:27 - old emulator and we here we roll we hear
10:34 - me or maybe somebody outside this idea
10:36 - who knows I thought let's see if we can
10:38 - recreate all these clocks in p5.js and I
10:41 - am pleased to report that if I go here
10:43 - and click on this URL I have all of
10:52 - these clocks ported to p5.js now me I am
10:55 - so me and many of the contributors have
10:58 - painstakingly looked at all sorts of
11:00 - details to really see if they're
11:01 - accurate but we could always do more of
11:03 - this this is an ongoing continuing
11:05 - project it's great that all these ports
11:06 - are here and I believe if I click on
11:08 - this we can see here a list of many of
11:12 - the contributors there all sorts of like
11:14 - interesting features that I don't know
11:17 - Oh Topher J and the chat is asking if
11:20 - the stream froze is it just Topher or a
11:25 - Topher's back but what now it's frozen
11:30 - for everybody although the game of life
11:31 - thing is still animating so I think I
11:33 - can click oh look at this
11:34 - I can click on it I get a big I don't
11:36 - even know I could do this I mean I am so
11:38 - music genius and probably somebody else
11:40 - who actually added this feature I could
11:43 - see this clock closer up and we can see
11:45 - a link a referent a link to the github
11:50 - user who helped to port this clock and
11:52 - many of these clocks were ported by
11:53 - multiple users and you can see there
11:55 - even here in the list wow this is
11:57 - incredible this is like the greatest
11:58 - thing ever so this is the clock now
12:01 - community project number two clouds
12:08 - coding trained community clouds so I'm
12:11 - gonna go to this year now now this is
12:14 - actually a project for day processing
12:18 - org so processing Day is a community day
12:21 - to celebrate the community of processing
12:23 - that's happening on October 21st that's
12:28 - the two weeks from today Yanks
12:30 - well it's weeks from tomorrow in
12:32 - Cambridge Massachusetts I will be there
12:34 - I'm apparently gonna do some sort of
12:35 - like live coding Train episode I mean
12:37 - this is live but live in person where my
12:40 - legs will be seen for the very first
12:42 - time let's see if I can make that happen
12:44 - now oh this is gonna if I get injured so
12:49 - then it was nice it was nice getting
12:52 - this like month of live streams there we
12:55 - go okay so I will be there with my legs
12:59 - and on October 21st and so one of the
13:06 - ideas for this conference and the thing
13:08 - that I'm going to do for the live code
13:09 - and train up sewed is making a cloud
13:10 - design but the idea for the name tags
13:13 - and I think this came from Tim choy and
13:15 - other organizers of the event is to have
13:19 - each nametag have the name inside of an
13:21 - algorithmic cloud so this website shows
13:25 - all of these clouds and I think maybe
13:27 - there's a way I can just with the arrow
13:29 - keys I don't know if that feature has
13:30 - been added yet is it like every once in
13:34 - a while changing the cloud oh if I click
13:43 - it just goes to a new cloud so we can
13:45 - see all these different cloud designs oh
13:47 - look at that beautiful and so you still
13:50 - have some time to submit a cloud and
13:52 - your design will be on a nametag at the
13:55 - processing Community Day event so if you
13:59 - want to learn more about how to submit a
14:01 - cloud go to the github repository there
14:03 - are some instructions there just file an
14:04 - issue I will say however that the
14:06 - deadline I mean this is an ongoing
14:08 - project I hope these clouds will live on
14:11 - forever and maybe be reused again
14:13 - another time for a different purpose but
14:15 - were probably going to print the actual
14:16 - name tags early next week you know
14:18 - Monday or Tuesday so let's just
14:19 - arbitrarily say that Monday morning
14:21 - October 9th is the deadline Monday
14:26 - morning Eastern Time like 9:00 a.m. is
14:28 - the deadline to submit your cloud if you
14:30 - want to make sure that it's has a chance
14:32 - to be printed and maybe will be a little
14:34 - late looks up
14:34 - relate but that's what I'll guarantee
14:36 - for right now okay so now loyal viewer
14:42 - of the coding train
14:44 - Simon Tiger who lives in Europe who is
14:48 - seven years old mind you has created a
14:53 - community project as well called
14:55 - procedural designs now I'm trying to
14:57 - figure out where am I gonna find this
15:00 - we're I'm gonna find Simon's URL hold on
15:04 - let's go let's try github.com slash
15:07 - Simon Tiger what's the chance that
15:09 - that's right no I'm gonna have to look
15:13 - this up somebody in the looking old
15:23 - music Simon Tiger interesting so am I in
15:50 - the right place
15:51 - github calm slash Simon Tiger /
15:55 - procedural - designs dunt dunt uh is it
16:00 - like Simon - Tiger there we go
16:04 - Simon - Tiger so um you can come here to
16:08 - see and let's look at the site and the
16:09 - idea this is inspired I think if by
16:12 - community clouds and but it allows you
16:15 - to submit something that's animated so
16:18 - well as the clouds or static designs and
16:21 - I Simon writes here there will be a new
16:24 - theme every month the theme this month
16:26 - the four elements water air fire earth
16:28 - so this is not an official community
16:32 - project but it is a community project
16:34 - that is created by Simon there's a loyal
16:38 - viewer and if people can provide some
16:40 - nice feedback or try test it out for him
16:43 - that would be wonderful and I would be
16:45 - glad to help with that
16:46 - okay what else I've got ah okay now the
16:51 - other thing is I have done some coding
16:52 - challenges recently and I am just amazed
16:56 - by if I go to whoops
16:58 - hashtag twitter.com hashtag ten print
17:06 - can you guys hear that music I just
17:10 - played in the classroom next to me so
17:12 - I've mentioned this book many times ten
17:14 - print I just have like books turn about
17:16 - the floor apparently here and there have
17:19 - been so many wonderful variations of the
17:22 - ten print design I encourage you to
17:23 - check out the Twitter hashtag ten print
17:26 - and my 10 print coding challenge if you
17:29 - want to keep that going on Twitter and
17:32 - also the new hashtag Ike which I think I
17:36 - need to workshop this a little more for
17:38 - the most recent coding challenge about
17:40 - recursion if I go to hashtag recursive
17:42 - train you can see that we're starting to
17:45 - get some submissions here so here's some
17:47 - nice variations by fire fluid on Twitter
17:51 - of the recursive design stuff that I
17:54 - showed in a previous coding challenge
17:55 - these are some kind of interesting ones
17:57 - it looks like this is combining
17:58 - recursion and ten print which exactly
18:02 - what chaos once on Twitter says this is
18:04 - quite beautiful oh and look so this let
18:08 - me actually click on the open processing
18:09 - link and there goes the camera which
18:11 - means I've been doing this for a half an
18:12 - hour this is called fractal oyd I think
18:21 - I'm not gonna oh this must respond to my
18:22 - microphone hello whoa this responds to
18:25 - sound oh oh here we go
18:30 - as always I always forget to this stop
18:33 - it stop it stop this dock
18:39 - awesome work and though this is a nice
18:43 - one I hadn't seen before by valu thick
18:48 - on Twitter and look at these I see some
18:50 - colorful ones coming up this is exciting
18:53 - look at these whoo I love this is
18:54 - beautiful
18:56 - love the choice of color and the
18:58 - variation of the circles so and nothing
19:01 - like a rainbow sierpinski triangle to
19:03 - bring joy to wednesday wonder if oh this
19:06 - is kind of crazy look at this so there's
19:08 - so many wonderful recursive designs that
19:10 - you can find on Twitter you can also I
19:12 - don't know if people have been doing
19:13 - this actually I haven't been keeping
19:14 - good track but if I go to coding train
19:19 - the code repository for the coding
19:22 - challenges and go all the way to the
19:23 - bottom and look at recursive design
19:27 - recursion there are none yet here so you
19:30 - can also pull requests and add links to
19:32 - your variations of the recursive design
19:35 - coding challenge I think this ends the
19:40 - introductory portion of today's Friday's
19:43 - coding train and so with that I am ready
19:46 - to actually start doing some coding but
19:48 - I will take a minute there's a little
19:50 - black mark on okay hold on there's a
19:53 - little black mark on the green screen if
19:56 - you go to a white page on your computer
19:58 - you will see it around the top right
20:00 - might be nice to fix it okay let's see
20:02 - so let me investigate this hold music
20:05 - please
20:07 - [Music]
20:09 - oh yeah look it's right there I see it
20:17 - wait over here
20:20 - what is that this it's not a black mark
20:25 - it is a cable a cable connecting a
20:30 - camera so let's see how do I get this
20:37 - out of the way is it this cable it's
20:38 - this cable it's actually this cable so I
20:45 - [Music]
20:57 - have my tricep muscles have fairly rich
21:00 - Burton
21:01 - hopefully my physical excellently there
21:06 - we go this is a good physical therapy
21:14 - live on the floating train a physical
21:17 - therapist I like erasing the whiteboard
21:19 - just good physical therapy cable tape
21:27 - problem resolved all right I feel like I
21:35 - look dark but maybe it's just if I come
21:36 - over here I'm out of the light over here
21:38 - so that's because I turned this light
21:40 - because of the glare issue lemme just
21:42 - see here how how much can I turn it more
21:46 - this way that's not so bad let's do that
21:48 - that's not such bad glare okay all right
21:51 - so I I am how what is it this is like
21:56 - don't tell me it's for oh my god it's
21:58 - four o'clock already it's okay
22:00 - what's the score of Red Sox versus
22:02 - Astros anybody no I'm not gonna watch
22:04 - that game later so I'm happy to be told
22:06 - in the chat baseball fans anybody okay
22:12 - five o'clock Yankees play Cleveland okay
22:22 - now I will take a minute to answer a few
22:27 - questions one of which I already know
22:29 - what it is is hey hey you coding train
22:36 - you had this video series about machine
22:39 - learning what happened to it so let me
22:43 - talk about that for a little bit and
22:44 - actually I think I might edit take this
22:48 - portion and edit it out to make a quick
22:52 - video because every time I produce a
22:54 - video now at least five of the comments
22:57 - are why aren't you making your machine
22:59 - learning videos that's what I'm here for
23:01 - and probably actually I'm projecting
23:03 - more likely the comment is like this you
23:14 - know just wondering I'm kind of
23:16 - interested in that machine learning
23:17 - stuff are you gonna get back to that so
23:20 - let me talk about that so where's my
23:25 - playlist do I have a playlist about
23:26 - machine learning by the way somebody
23:30 - asks why I was not subscribed to Suraj's
23:32 - channel when he was a guest here and it
23:35 - is because I am logged in on some like
23:38 - dummy
23:39 - count which is coding rainbow live at
23:41 - gmail.com don't email that address I'll
23:43 - never check it but why not have why not
23:49 - subscribe to YouTube channels also
23:51 - what's the one three blue brown what's
23:54 - that math channel that's awesome
23:57 - three blue brown Houston is winning four
24:02 - to one fifth inning three blue one brown
24:04 - okay so let me subscribe to that channel
24:08 - to 90,000 subscribers good work three
24:12 - blue brown uploads here we go
24:18 - would you guys mind if we just watch
24:20 - this video together would that be an
24:22 - appropriate use of this light stroking
24:24 - time probably not okay let me go to
24:27 - Suraj's channel and what's the
24:35 - interplanetary file system I have no
24:36 - idea what that is because I have to
24:37 - watch that later let me go to the coding
24:40 - training look how I just procrastinate
24:45 - for max doing any actual coding because
24:48 - I thought I was gonna answer their
24:49 - questions oh I see I'm not logged in as
24:51 - myself that's what's ultimately really
24:53 - confusing me
24:53 - here we go well have you thought I have
25:03 - you thought about exploring machine
25:04 - learning this is the class on udemy
25:08 - taught by an expert instructor you can
25:12 - make bro Busta models you should
25:15 - definitely consider that none of this
25:16 - nonsense here
25:17 - alright so okay so let me talk about
25:22 - this watching hello I'm here I am here
25:36 - mostly to apologize please stop don't
25:38 - throw the tomatoes the green wall will
25:41 - have Tomatoes flats on them but I'm here
25:43 - just to give a quick update about the my
25:45 - machine learning videos that I have a
25:46 - playlist called ten neuro networks - the
25:50 - nature of code I was making these videos
25:52 - over the summer
25:52 - then I had this moment where I was like
25:55 - riding along on a bicycle and I was
25:56 - thinking way too much about machine
25:58 - learning
25:58 - I had a bump fell over I broke my elbow
26:01 - I had surgery on it twice I lost a
26:04 - couple months of like being able to make
26:06 - content and then the fall started so
26:09 - unfortunately I was in the middle of
26:11 - this series I was at ten point seven I
26:14 - had made seven videos that's crazy
26:15 - and every time I upload a video now
26:18 - comments asking could I please continue
26:20 - that series and I am planning to
26:22 - continue it what I do here on the coding
26:25 - train is I make videos about stuff that
26:31 - I'm currently teaching at my full-time
26:34 - job here at New York University and
26:36 - currently what I'm teaching is an
26:37 - introduction to programming course and
26:39 - of course about text analysis so I am
26:42 - going to be making some videos about
26:44 - chatbots which is kind of adjacent to
26:46 - machine learning can be a tool to drive
26:49 - a chatbot I'm also gonna make some
26:51 - videos about hopefully long term short
26:54 - long short term I can't remember I don't
26:56 - have long or short term memory but some
26:58 - of these recurrent neural networks for
27:00 - text generation and then I my hope is
27:02 - that I will be coming back to this
27:04 - playlist again after this semester is
27:06 - over or towards the end of the semester
27:08 - if I finished up some of the content so
27:10 - in the meantime I hope to continue to
27:14 - have some github repositories where I'm
27:16 - gonna be making some new examples so
27:18 - stay in touch with me on Twitter and I
27:20 - would recommend to you well as you've
27:23 - seen as a guest on my channel Suraj has
27:25 - a channel about deep learning and also
27:27 - this is a new video that just came out
27:29 - from one of my favorite channels three
27:32 - blue one Brown but what is a neural
27:34 - network deep learning part one so now we
27:36 - have an internet competition will deep
27:39 - learning part to come out before ten
27:46 - point eight the answer is almost a
27:49 - definite yes so please write all of your
27:51 - complaints in the comments here I'm
27:52 - going to read them I'm going to sit with
27:55 - some sort of like meditative cucumber
27:58 - eye mask thing on and I'm going to
28:00 - listen to all of your feedback about why
28:02 - I should do this right now and
28:03 - the other stuff that I'm doing now and
28:04 - then I will feel guilty for a while and
28:07 - then eventually these videos will come
28:08 - out okay so thanks for watching this
28:10 - short little video explanation and I'll
28:14 - see you soon all right the sound is off
28:19 - everybody is telling me all sorts of
28:21 - technical stuff so that ad was super
28:26 - targeted right right it was like look
28:28 - you're gonna watch some crazy lunatics
28:30 - video about neural networks would you
28:33 - like to watch this absolutely sane
28:35 - you'd-you'd how do you say that you Demi
28:37 - you to me you to me I'm never gonna get
28:40 - them as a sponsor now and their ads
28:42 - gonna be removed from all my videos
28:43 - shortly I'm sure they're wonderful
28:45 - people over it you to me it's like
28:47 - Academy but you to me so it must be you
28:50 - to me so instead of it instead of
28:52 - Academy for the icons
28:54 - it's the udemy for the use you got it
28:56 - now alright um three blue brown you make
29:00 - some wonderful videos support three boob
29:02 - on support Siraj support oh look at this
29:05 - oh my goodness okay
29:12 - oh is the sound sticking off let's try
29:16 - so he's talking to me it sounds like the
29:19 - teachers in Charlie Brown won't long cuz
29:21 - just coming through the you know
29:23 - soundproof room
29:24 - I'm definitely to get to some coding
29:26 - soon swear swear I affirm I affirm I
29:29 - will get to some coding soon I
29:30 - remembered one other thing I wanted to
29:31 - mention I'm changing something here to
29:39 - do multi output device okay so now I
29:42 - think you can hear the audio and I'm
29:44 - going to go to SoundCloud so Christian
29:50 - Petersen or Christian Peterson I'm not
29:51 - sure if I'm pronouncing this correctly
29:53 - is keeping a playlist on soundcloud of
29:59 - coding train remixes best is where the
30:02 - biscuit song originally came from and
30:04 - there is another this song made by f
30:06 - looper the creator of the Perlin noise
30:08 - song which I play a lot and there's some
30:10 - other ones the loading song by Ike
30:12 - Bishop this is I haven't been able to
30:15 - add these to my
30:16 - on board yet so this is a new one called
30:23 - mini-me me so while I get ready to
30:33 - figure out what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
30:36 - play this song for you guys
30:43 - now a little contest here who can figure
30:46 - out which video this came from
30:47 - the fastest I don't know I don't have a
30:51 - prize for this contest but a shout-out
30:54 - will give a prize all right can you
31:01 - actually can you guys actually hear this
31:02 - oh that was the end of the song okay so
31:08 - let's put on the loading song I like
31:11 - that I'm just reading Twitter okay
31:18 - ah I'm getting ready to do some coding
31:37 - [Music]
31:41 - music okay thank you much
32:21 - maybe s can hear the people okay I got I
32:24 - got to turn this off I got a I got a
32:27 - start I've lost my the temperature in
32:31 - here is very wor okay all right so now
32:39 - what I want to do is talk about chatbots
32:44 - so this is this is I'm gonna do the
32:52 - object stuff but I sort of felt like if
32:55 - I did the object stuff that I would
32:58 - never get to the chatbot stuff that I
33:00 - want to do today so my goal is to so let
33:08 - me see here
33:10 - sorry I have to like plan this while I'm
33:12 - here with you guys so if I go to is
33:17 - there a programming with text one here
33:21 - no 15 so let's see here playlists I'm
33:29 - looking for my a-to-z playlists I really
33:38 - have to be logged into my own account
33:40 - all right I'll figure this out so this
33:42 - is gonna be a new this is going to be a
33:44 - new series of videos for the A to Z
33:48 - course it used to be called the A to Z
33:49 - it's called the A to Z course but I'm
33:51 - from YouTube I'm calling a program in
33:53 - with text because it's kind of an
33:54 - advanced course why don't you use a fan
33:56 - fan working here
33:58 - you think the client I think it's
34:00 - because I'm in a storage closet that
34:02 - there isn't really good climate control
34:03 - in this room so I have a little
34:05 - presentation that
34:07 - NACHA helped me with and so I mean this
34:12 - is a new experiment for me which is to
34:14 - actually like walk through some slides
34:15 - as if I like had a plan for what I was
34:18 - doing and talked a little bit about
34:20 - chatbots
34:20 - then I'm gonna do a tutorial about a
34:23 - chatbot framework called rive script and
34:27 - then I want to do a coding challenge or
34:29 - show you how to use this chat bot
34:31 - framework rive script which is open
34:33 - source with p5 GS and the brown
34:35 - this will lead me to eventually show you
34:38 - how to do speech to text in the browser
34:41 - so your chat bot could actually listen
34:43 - to what you're saying and talk back to
34:44 - you as if you were programming your own
34:46 - Alexa kind of our Google home type to a
34:49 - conversational interface from scratch
34:50 - we've only open-source tools and then I
34:54 - also want to explore using some not
34:57 - necessarily open-source tools like what
34:58 - does it does it need to make a skill for
35:00 - something like a product like the Amazon
35:02 - Alexa so I have materials for all of
35:04 - this already with my A to Z course I'll
35:07 - include links to that in whatever video
35:08 - descriptions I make and yes so this will
35:13 - this probably happen over the next
35:15 - couple weeks a little bit today a little
35:17 - bit next week so let's begin with that
35:19 - now I'm looking at the chat all right so
35:28 - hello welcome to the first video in a
35:31 - new section of my programming with text
35:34 - series so this kind of follows on the
35:36 - Twitter bot series because what I want
35:39 - to look at in this section is how to
35:41 - make a chat bot so now we can just think
35:43 - of that - this term bot in a much more
35:44 - general way I mean Twitter bot could be
35:46 - a chat bot chat bot could be a Twitter
35:48 - bot I don't know what's the difference
35:49 - so when I think about BOTS I am this is
35:53 - straight from Wikipedia but a chat bot
35:55 - this is what I'm talking about I want to
35:57 - think about ways that I can make a
35:59 - computer program which conducts a
36:02 - conversation via auditory or textual
36:03 - methods so this could be a one-sided
36:06 - conversation I could just be a Twitter
36:07 - bot that just says things every once in
36:09 - a while to nobody or to myself I could
36:11 - be two computers talking to each other I
36:13 - could be a computer and a human I could
36:16 - talk to my ok Expo what's the weather
36:21 - today oh shoot this thing does not
36:23 - actually how many electronics or
36:24 - speeches well but if I add like some
36:27 - sort of product from some company that
36:30 - I'm not gonna buzz market right now for
36:31 - free because he just sponsored me no not
36:33 - really I would show you that so I'm
36:35 - gonna get to all that sort of stuff in
36:36 - these videos series there's gonna be a
36:38 - lot of them this is just the first one
36:39 - so I want to think about where this
36:43 - topic comes from so of course many of
36:48 - you are probably
36:49 - familiar with Alan Turing and Alan
36:52 - Turing's question oh wait a second I'm
36:57 - sorry get the chat but you were looking
37:02 - at the chat I this is the thing I gotta
37:04 - stop I you know there's you shouldn't be
37:05 - stuff it's edited out ever but anyway
37:08 - okay oops
37:12 - I don't know it slides are coming next
37:14 - as I'm not prepared let's keep going
37:19 - Turing test is probably something that
37:21 - you you may be familiar with if not I'll
37:23 - include some links for further reading
37:25 - in this alright hold on
37:31 - pause I just ran what's the seminal
37:33 - paper called the Alan Turing paper it's
37:37 - called can machines think right where
37:41 - where the imitation game is proposed
37:49 - don't look at this machines think
37:57 - nobody's answered my question I do have
38:00 - a reddit AMA but I'm never gonna get
38:02 - through this if I'm gonna like try to
38:03 - like do some research like remember what
38:06 - the names of things are what's the paper
38:08 - called somebody's gonna tell me nobody's
38:19 - nobody's telling me this I'm just gonna
38:21 - keep going okay this is me reading
38:25 - Wikipedia backwards really fat is like
38:28 - it's entering my brain
38:39 - Papa thought yes I'm really looking at
38:42 - this in the wrong order the wrong order
38:54 - Computing Machinery and intelligence
38:56 - that's what I have here no wonder I just
38:58 - couldn't remember that thank you
39:10 - we're gonna get through this everybody
39:12 - you and me together so this idea of a
39:16 - chatbot of a computer that's having a
39:18 - conversation is nothing new we can we
39:20 - can date this research back to Alan
39:22 - Turing the seminal paper Computing
39:24 - Machinery and intelligence inspiration
39:26 - for the movie the the the imitation game
39:28 - can a computer think can a computer have
39:31 - a conversation much like a human being
39:32 - might have a conversation are their
39:35 - imaginable digital computers which would
39:37 - do well in the imitation game eliza is
39:40 - an example of a chatbot created about
39:42 - the MIT artificial intelligence library
39:44 - in 1966 it simulated a conversation
39:48 - using pattern matching and substitution
39:49 - so this is really a key key points here
39:52 - so what does it mean to program a
39:55 - chatbot what are some techniques and
39:57 - styles for doing that and you might be
39:58 - thinking I know deep learning neural
40:01 - networks super artificial intelligent
40:03 - magic computer machine thing but one way
40:05 - to develop a chatbot that's actually
40:07 - quite powerful and is the way that I'm
40:08 - gonna start with some simple examples is
40:10 - by doing simple pattern matching and
40:12 - substitution by that I mean I'm trying
40:14 - to match a pattern in something that the
40:16 - person the human being or the other side
40:18 - of the conversation is saying and I have
40:20 - a database of replies for different
40:22 - patterns that I might match so Eliza's a
40:26 - well-known a chatbot example perry is
40:30 - another one from 1972 created by Kenneth
40:32 - Colby at Stanford which attempted to
40:34 - simulate a person with paranoid
40:36 - schizophrenia so informally known as
40:38 - Eliza with attitude there is the lobe no
40:41 - prize which is an annual competition
40:43 - artificial intelligence that Awards a
40:45 - prize to the Chatterbox considered by
40:47 - the judges to be the most human-like you
40:49 - know I think it's
40:51 - you know one could be critical about
40:53 - this you know a little worried I'm gonna
41:02 - I'm gonna it's alright everything's
41:04 - gonna be fine but I keep going through
41:05 - this I'm standing in front of the slides
41:09 - is like I'm not really like meant for
41:11 - this but so I think one question about
41:15 - the Loebner prize is is this is is this
41:18 - really is this is evaluating a
41:20 - computer's abilities to trick a human
41:22 - being into thinking it's a human
41:23 - actually a appropriate metric or measure
41:27 - of some form of intelligence or ability
41:29 - to carry out a conversation or is it
41:30 - just a metric of being able to
41:32 - foolishness way of like you know the
41:35 - best trickery and is there what's the
41:38 - what's the substance behind that
41:39 - trickery so I think which is something a
41:41 - question to ask beyond just is it
41:42 - fooling me or not so Alice is a project
41:47 - from 1995 as inspired by Eliza part of
41:52 - out the Alice project is something
41:54 - called AI ml which is an artificial
41:56 - intelligence markup language similar to
41:59 - something like XML or JSON it's a format
42:01 - for creating a script in essence for
42:04 - chatbot alice is the inspiration for the
42:06 - Spike Jonze movie her and this is
42:11 - interesting because the reason why I
42:13 - bring this up is so this is what AI ml
42:17 - looks like and this is directly from the
42:19 - Alice bot org website so this is great
42:22 - but it can be a little bit unwieldy to
42:23 - work with so what I want to do is look
42:25 - at systems that work in this way with
42:28 - something called a retrieval model so
42:30 - this I want to say that most of this
42:32 - information is from this wonderful
42:34 - article which is from Wild ml calm deep
42:37 - learning for chat BOTS and part one so a
42:41 - retrieval model is a way of creating a
42:44 - chat bot where there are a set of
42:46 - predefined responses and you're doing
42:49 - this pattern matching so you're trying
42:51 - to figure out some kind of heuristic of
42:52 - heuristic as a fancy word for educated
42:54 - guess basically I'm trying to figure out
42:56 - like aha the user said something which
42:59 - slot does that fit in
43:01 - did the is the user saying like what's
43:02 - the weather or
43:04 - order a pizza or what is it does it
43:06 - match some type of pattern and I have
43:08 - some predefined responses for different
43:09 - patterns so now that's heuristic that
43:12 - way of making an educated guess could be
43:14 - a really advanced machine learning
43:17 - system with some kind of like neural
43:18 - network thing or it could just be like
43:20 - regular expressions and pattern matching
43:21 - or looking for exact phrases and so you
43:24 - there's a lot that you can do even with
43:25 - these basic ideas generative model is
43:29 - something I also want to look at which
43:30 - is a way we'll we'll use some type of
43:32 - algorithm a context-free grammar or a
43:34 - Markov chain a recurrent neural network
43:36 - some type of algorithm to generate the
43:38 - response as opposed to having these
43:39 - predefined set of responses this is very
43:42 - similar to how machine translation
43:44 - systems work something else to consider
43:46 - really is are you building a chatbot
43:50 - that's going to have a short
43:52 - conversation or a long conversation and
43:54 - my and certainly you could think of it's
43:56 - going to be much easier so an example of
43:58 - a short conversation is knock knock
44:01 - who's there
44:03 - chat bot chat bot who I'm making a video
44:10 - about chat BOTS that wasn't very funny
44:15 - so that's a short conversation and you
44:18 - could imagine that that's going to be a
44:20 - much easier thing to program in some
44:21 - long conversation that's going to I
44:23 - don't know talk about some you know
44:26 - Ionesco ZnO exit the play and what it
44:28 - means to you in your life or something
44:29 - like that so and by the way no exit was
44:33 - written by Sartre not ionesco this is
44:38 - really not going well I don't like this
44:40 - whole use a presentation thing
44:42 - I'm just trying it as an experiment I
44:43 - might not use this okay another thing to
44:46 - consider is open domain versus closed
44:48 - domain conversations you know are you
44:51 - creating a chat bot that the only thing
44:53 - the person will ever do with this chat
44:54 - bot is order a pizza and then you have
44:56 - kind of a framework to say well they
44:58 - might say large or small or medium they
45:00 - might say you know broccoli is broccoli
45:03 - appropriate topping for pizza I don't
45:04 - really eat pizza whatever they you know
45:06 - there's a closed domain of possible
45:08 - things that could be discussed as
45:09 - opposed to open-ended conversation that
45:11 - could be just about anything so this is
45:14 - certainly a much easier thing I think
45:16 - for you to work with in programs
45:17 - what I want to kind of focus on right
45:19 - now in these tutorials are short closed
45:22 - domain conversations that I think is a
45:24 - good place to start with building a
45:25 - chatbot oh yeah deep learning has
45:28 - something to do with this there's some
45:30 - interesting things that we could play
45:31 - with if you're looking at training data
45:33 - to sort of look at if you're going to
45:35 - use a generative model or a machine
45:36 - learning based model there's the
45:38 - internet movie script database which has
45:39 - like tons of movie scripts which are
45:41 - essentially big scripts of dialogue many
45:44 - of them and there's the boo to dialogue
45:47 - corpus which is a large data set from
45:49 - chat rooms that's open source that you
45:52 - can look at with these links and there's
45:54 - some wonderful and interesting projects
45:56 - and papers that I will include trained
45:59 - on friends episodes and all sorts of
46:03 - interesting things so there are some
46:05 - frameworks that you can look at that I
46:06 - would recommend that people tell me are
46:09 - interesting here's a list of some of
46:10 - them but what I want to use in my
46:12 - starting tutorials it's something called
46:14 - Drive scripts so rie script is fertile
46:16 - it's open source I'm pretty sure it's
46:17 - MIT license I will check that I'll have
46:19 - to correct this if it's not it's a
46:21 - simple scripting language for chat BOTS
46:22 - with a friendly easy to learn syntax
46:24 - this is all from write script comm and
46:26 - it's you you can it has just really a
46:28 - handful of simple rules that you can
46:30 - combine and recombine it with some
46:32 - powerful results to create a personality
46:35 - so this is where I'm gonna start I'm
46:36 - gonna look at a variety of techniques
46:39 - for creating chat BOTS I'm maybe even do
46:41 - some coding challenges to try to make
46:43 - some specific chat BOTS and I hope that
46:45 - you will make some interesting chat bots
46:46 - with me now you might be asking oh I
46:47 - want to make something for Facebook or
46:50 - discord or I don't know snapchat can you
46:53 - make a bot for snapchat probably not you
46:56 - might be wondering about this so I'm
46:57 - gonna stay pretty platform agnostic for
47:00 - at least the beginning and just look at
47:01 - systems and principles and you could
47:03 - plug in to other systems but at some
47:05 - point I will try to take a look just
47:06 - like I did with the Twitter bot series
47:07 - of some specific services that you might
47:10 - want to plug into where your thing that
47:12 - you're making has a conversation okay so
47:14 - I don't know if this video was useful or
47:15 - not but you just hear on the internet
47:17 - now and you have watched it and I will
47:20 - see you where I'll actually do some
47:21 - coding soon in the next video where I
47:23 - introduce Rhys script
47:27 - okay yeah pizza really is good I do like
47:31 - to eat pizza it's just you know I tried
47:36 - very I try to be very healthy eater not
47:38 - that pizza is unhealthy nothing
47:39 - unhealthy about pizza but you know if
47:41 - that's all anyway I don't know I'm
47:43 - talking about now okay
47:51 - right lactose intolerance that's really
47:55 - my problem cheese though is that really
47:57 - lactose I don't know it's one of your
48:02 - five a day oh yes it is
48:05 - okay the reason why I got a little
48:09 - paranoid there is that I'm very I like
48:13 - to be incredibly conscientious about
48:16 - crediting sources and this is some
48:22 - slides I made for a my class and I think
48:27 - a bit differently about things that I
48:28 - might show in a class if I'm quoting
48:30 - from something whereas I do versus
48:35 - things that I might show on this live
48:37 - stream so I got a little worried that
48:38 - like is you know did I not properly
48:41 - credit these so anyway so I'm gonna I'm
48:44 - gonna just sort of double check that but
48:47 - okay
48:49 - alright I'm having a little trouble
48:53 - today it's 4:30 what's the score of the
48:54 - Red Sox game now he's still waiting go
48:56 - Astros alright so let's see here
49:05 - it's so warm in here today I'm going to
49:09 - open this door for some fresh air for a
49:11 - second okay so here's rife script I
49:17 - should just start with the object stuff
49:18 - I feel unprepared for this tutorial is a
49:22 - really important this is a really
49:24 - excellent page and I had some notes I
49:28 - wrote down weird I
49:29 - them so what I'm gonna do is I am going
49:35 - to yeah I'm just scanning through this
49:43 - to remind myself about rice scripts okay
49:49 - all right okay
50:02 - so are you guys ready for this we are
50:04 - going to actually we are actually going
50:09 - to thank you Chris virgin four to one in
50:11 - the six inning
50:11 - okay we are actually going to do some
50:17 - stuff with rice crib now let me go to
50:18 - try it and I think rice script
50:24 - playground might work better yeah okay
50:31 - and all right okay and then what I need
50:37 - to do I think is probably dude this
50:40 - great and this okay here we go ready
50:45 - we're gonna make our first bot so this
50:50 - is going to be a quick tutorial of what
50:54 - is rice script and some of its features
50:57 - and it's bear with me for a second
51:06 - remember what these things are called
51:12 - write command symbol okay
51:19 - command symbol okay here we go everybody
51:26 - hello welcome to my first video beyond
51:29 - my introductory video about making chat
51:32 - BOTS and again I am using something
51:34 - called rive script and open source an
51:39 - open source library for chat BOTS a link
51:41 - to the github repository thank you to
51:44 - the creators and maintainer zuv rive
51:45 - scripts it's a wonderful project I've
51:47 - used it and a lot of things before I
51:49 - really enjoy using it so I'm gonna try
51:51 - to show you a bit about how it works I
51:53 - am not some sort of official
51:54 - representative of the rive script
51:56 - project I'm just a user and fan of write
51:58 - script so the idea oh boy
52:07 - the idea of Rive script is to is pattern
52:12 - matching is a is it it's basically a
52:14 - chatbot system that uses a technique
52:16 - called pattern matching and retrieval oh
52:18 - those are the right terms let me
52:20 - describe to you what I the user says
52:24 - something hello that goes into the chat
52:31 - box brain the brain does something so
52:37 - this is input and then gives a reply hi
52:45 - we could actually make a chat I know
52:48 - it's shocking I know we could program a
52:50 - chat bot that does this any time the
52:51 - user says ha hello and then that could
52:54 - be typed in or spoken in depending on
52:55 - what sort of what our interactive what
52:58 - our what medium we're we're kind of
52:59 - deploying this chat bot says hello and
53:03 - the reply which the word reply has an L
53:05 - in it guess we're wondering it says hi
53:08 - so rive script is the thing that i want
53:12 - to use here I want it to be the brain of
53:15 - the chat bot it's not the only option in
53:17 - the world for programming or creating a
53:19 - chat bot brain but it is one option I am
53:22 - going to start at least by using
53:24 - javascript and p5.js to take my input
53:27 - and display my reply so I'm gonna build
53:29 - a simple chat bot that just runs in the
53:30 - browser programmed with JavaScript in
53:32 - the p5 just library but I'm gonna have
53:34 - its brain driven by RIE script and this
53:36 - brain uses a technique called pattern
53:40 - matching so ultimately there are so many
53:44 - different kinds of things we could put
53:45 - into this brain that are super
53:46 - sophisticated but one thing I could
53:48 - actually do is just say did the users
53:50 - say exactly this word hello or did it
53:53 - say the word hello or hi or howdy can I
53:56 - match one of these possible phrases that
53:59 - the user said and if it said one of
54:01 - these possible phrases that I'm gonna
54:02 - say this exact reply this is the idea of
54:06 - Rive script and so every rive script is
54:10 - really just a markup syntax for
54:12 - configuring different sorts of expected
54:15 - patterns much like a regular expression
54:17 - if you look at my regular
54:18 - tutorials that you might expect the user
54:20 - to say and the replies that should come
54:23 - with those patterns so every so the way
54:26 - arrives and Rui script is modeled off of
54:28 - something called a I M L artificial
54:35 - intelligence markup language which is an
54:36 - XML like tag based markup thing that is
54:40 - interesting you could also use but rive
54:42 - script has a bit of a simpler syntax so
54:44 - in ryf script every single was just a
54:47 - text file every single line in the text
54:50 - file begins with a command symbol so
54:53 - some possible command symbols are an
54:56 - exclamation point plus minus and pound
55:00 - or hash tag so this is just wait timeout
55:03 - how am i doing with the whiteboard today
55:06 - it's the white boy look you can see it
55:08 - everything seems fine there's like a gif
55:12 - of okay sorry okay that looks good what
55:25 - I was saying so for example this chat
55:29 - bot that I want to program would look
55:30 - like this hello hi which means the plus
55:40 - means this is the pattern I want to
55:42 - match as the input and the reply that I
55:46 - want to give to that input is the - this
55:48 - is the reply now one thing I could do is
55:51 - I could have two possible replies so the
55:55 - first thing i can do in rai script is
55:56 - configure an input that i'm looking for
55:59 - and then give a set of possible replies
56:02 - and rive script will pick one of those
56:04 - randomly there actually isn't even a
56:06 - syntax for waiting these so I could say
56:08 - 90% of the time I want to say hi and 10%
56:12 - of the time I want to say howdy so you
56:14 - know that's a level of detail that I
56:15 - don't think I need right now for what
56:17 - I'm gonna try to demonstrate but that is
56:19 - possible so you might be asking the
56:20 - question okay if that's the basic idea
56:22 - well how do I learn what all the
56:25 - possible things I could put
56:27 - here are and and hopefully I'm going to
56:29 - show you some of them I don't actually
56:30 - really I don't have them memorized so
56:32 - I'm gonna have to like learn them and
56:33 - figure them out as I go a bit and and
56:37 - and and and how where do I learn that
56:40 - stuff so and and where can I test out so
56:43 - could I test out a brain configuration
56:46 - without having to write my own
56:47 - JavaScript code so yes yes yes all of
56:50 - the above just come over here with me oh
56:53 - look we're over here so this is the rive
56:57 - script website I find if you go to just
56:59 - rise script comm you'll come to the main
57:01 - web page but under here a slash Doc's
57:04 - tutorial this is a wonderful walkthrough
57:06 - of all the possible features and you can
57:09 - see here I'm going to skip some stuff
57:10 - here about you can say here here is the
57:13 - your first chat bot same thing that I've
57:15 - said exclamation point is a kind of
57:18 - command simple for like a configuration
57:21 - thing you can actually store variables
57:22 - and different things like that in the
57:23 - chat pod which I will get to so we want
57:25 - to be compatible with version 2.0 of
57:27 - Rive script and i want a plus to say
57:30 - hello bot and a minus to say i want to I
57:32 - want to look for the user saying hello
57:34 - bot and I want the bot say hello human
57:36 - so let's go and actually test this now
57:38 - there's something called the rice script
57:39 - playground and I'm gonna get rid of this
57:42 - part of it so here is that chat bot in
57:45 - the right script playground and I can
57:47 - say well I'm gonna say run so I can down
57:51 - here say hello bot and it says hello
57:56 - human and I'm going to say hi hi bot and
58:01 - it says error no match reply no no reply
58:04 - match so here's the first thing I want
58:06 - to do I would like to have something
58:08 - that's a catch-all of response for
58:10 - anything I don't know about let's add
58:12 - that pause point to the video we're
58:15 - gonna look up how to do that ah catch oh
58:23 - I think it's just a wild card catch all
58:25 - triggers just start yeah that's what I
58:26 - thought okay I was right I didn't have
58:27 - to look that up okay so just like in
58:31 - regular expressions where you have meta
58:33 - characters and literal characters and
58:36 - this is what I'm saying here is like I
58:38 - want to match exactly hello
58:40 - notice there's no capitalization here so
58:42 - capitalization and punctuation don't
58:44 - really play a role in the patterns that
58:46 - you're matching you're just looking for
58:47 - the raw text but I can have wildcards so
58:51 - I couldn't say something like Apple I
58:55 - love apples - or apples are delicious so
59:02 - now I'm using a wild card so Apple
59:04 - anything after Apple will give you one
59:07 - of these responses so now if I run it
59:10 - Apple you eats question mark apples are
59:14 - delicious Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple
59:17 - I love apples to see we even got one the
59:20 - different one the second time but if I
59:22 - say hello Apple error no reply matched
59:26 - so this is one way you can use a chat
59:28 - bot to kind of just realize that the
59:30 - users kind of brought up a certain topic
59:32 - so for example if you want to say
59:34 - anywhere the word Apple appears if the
59:37 - user says anything with Apple say like
59:40 - oh let's talk about apples and then I
59:44 - can also use a complete and total just
59:47 - one star as a wildcard to say like I
59:50 - prefer to discuss fruit so now I'm gonna
59:55 - run my chat bot and I'm going to say
59:58 - hello bot hello human and I'm gonna say
60:01 - I'm gonna say let's discuss pokemons and
60:06 - then rock group says I prefer to discuss
60:08 - fruit oh I love apples and oh no oh no
60:15 - what happened here so look at this oh I
60:18 - love apples ROG script is saying I
60:20 - prefer to discuss fruit am i still
60:22 - making a video about chat BOTS in this
60:24 - is actually like what I'm talking about
60:26 - oh boy hopefully this is okay here so I
60:29 - think what's going on here is I have
60:30 - Apple space star and maybe if I did
60:34 - Apple star like that then now I could
60:38 - say oh I love apples oh let's talk about
60:43 - apples so that space was actually
60:45 - matching their the Apple space star I
60:47 - needed to have I couldn't you I couldn't
60:49 - match apples okay anyway so you get
60:54 - the basic idea here this we could see
60:56 - here so this is very little like this is
60:58 - just like all I we've learned so far is
61:00 - I can match something exactly or I can
61:02 - match something with a wild card there
61:05 - are many more things that you can do I
61:08 - will not be able to show you all of them
61:10 - but I'm going to show you a couple more
61:11 - things pause for a second I need to
61:13 - drink some water and think about what
61:14 - I'm going to do next
61:15 - this is what happens right so my
61:16 - intention by the way for those of you
61:18 - watching this live stream the pizza
61:21 - actually so ordering pizza is actually a
61:23 - pretty good as an example that I see a
61:24 - lot on the internet for yes it's gonna
61:32 - make that pineapples or apples it's a
61:34 - very good point so I think it's my
61:39 - intention actually really was this
61:40 - morning to go through all this rice
61:42 - group stuff to prepare and I didn't do
61:45 - it so this is kind of a mess I think I
61:47 - think it's better if I usually I try to
61:49 - make videos after I've taught something
61:51 - in class and I usually didn't get to
61:52 - this in class so one thing I want to
61:54 - look at is variables open-ended tree
61:59 - these are all these are called triggers
62:00 - I forgot about that so I'll mention that
62:04 - I'm saying input but they're really
62:05 - called triggers oh yeah and that all
62:10 - right remember right okay okay
62:17 - so let's add a few more things to this
62:20 - chat bot now one thing that I would like
62:23 - to mention is that the the the these are
62:27 - the the plus elements without I've been
62:29 - calling inputs are actually called
62:30 - triggers so the term for that is trigger
62:31 - and you'll actually see in some modern
62:34 - chat bot systems this word called intent
62:37 - so we're trying to match the intention
62:39 - of the user
62:41 - what if which in what is their intention
62:42 - and what would i if what is it that they
62:45 - want to do and i need to reply
62:46 - accordingly so one thing that you we can
62:49 - do that's nice about these wildcards is
62:54 - we can also use what the person said in
62:56 - the wild-card in the reply so I can say
62:59 - what if the user says my name is star
63:02 - and I could say nice to meet you and
63:05 - then star so I can refer back to what
63:10 - they said by putting star in the these
63:12 - greater than Alessa so I can say my name
63:18 - is coding train now interestingly enough
63:21 - nice to meet you coding train and it
63:24 - didn't keep my capitalization and
63:26 - there's probably some way that I could
63:27 - configure that we could look through the
63:29 - documentation and that's a little bit
63:31 - weird that my name is coding train but
63:33 - so that's one thing you can do we can
63:34 - also have multiple stars so I could do
63:37 - something like my name is star star and
63:41 - then I could change that nice to meet
63:44 - you star I could be like really weird
63:48 - about this star 2 comma star 1 so like
63:51 - for example my name is Daniel she Mon
63:59 - nice to meet you Schiffman comma Daniel
64:02 - because this is a thought who likes to
64:04 - speak very formally so you can see here
64:06 - that you can match the different
64:08 - different stars in a particular order so
64:10 - again there is nothing going there's
64:13 - this is there's no type of learning or
64:15 - training I am configuring precise
64:19 - patterns for the bots to look for with
64:22 - certain replies
64:28 - okay I'm just looking at the chat and
64:33 - can we make the chap out return dynamit
64:36 - responses like if the user sends Bitcoin
64:38 - price them oh yeah okay so a question is
64:45 - coming up in the chat which is great
64:47 - which is like well what if you what if
64:48 - the user asks something about the
64:50 - weather and you wanted to say well the
64:52 - web the temperature today is blank so
64:54 - this would be some this is why I want to
64:56 - combine Drive script with JavaScript and
64:58 - I'm gonna do this in the next video but
65:00 - this is just essentially the script for
65:02 - the brain but there's no reason if I'm
65:04 - not if I'm using this brain in my own
65:05 - code that I couldn't also inject
65:07 - something like an API call so I will
65:10 - have you know there's not I could write
65:11 - my own program to do a lot if elseis if
65:14 - conditional statements and regular
65:15 - expressions that I don't need rive
65:17 - script before but riah script is a nice
65:19 - syntax for me able to configure a really
65:21 - elaborate set of possible possibilities
65:24 - and then I can combine that with coding
65:26 - to do something much more dynamic so
65:28 - that's really where I'm trying to go
65:29 - with this here so I want to look at a
65:31 - few more features in Rive script so
65:35 - substitutions is an important one let me
65:37 - look for that substitutions this is this
65:43 - can be edited out match yeah yeah I
65:46 - can't spell substitution yeah okay
65:55 - an important feature of Rive script is
65:58 - substitutions because you know you might
66:01 - have something where the the chat bot
66:05 - might say who is there not the chat bot
66:08 - do you the trigger you're looking for is
66:10 - who is there but the user might say
66:11 - who's there or who is there and so
66:13 - something you can do in Rive script is
66:15 - configure all these different
66:17 - substitutions meaning these are
66:19 - equivalent substitute I'm for I am
66:22 - substitute I'd for I would so you can
66:24 - put I m in your chat bot let's do this
66:28 - right here let's put this here I'm gonna
66:33 - add this as a substitution at the top
66:35 - and now I'm going to say I'm going to
66:41 - say I'm oh I'm just gonna change this to
66:46 - I'm oh I am sorry and now I'm gonna run
66:52 - this and I can say I am Dan Schiffman
66:56 - nice to meet you shift in comma Dan or
66:58 - I'm ship I'm Dan Schiffman same thing so
67:03 - now I have a substitution so this is a
67:05 - way that I can have this particular
67:07 - phrase and so one thing that you can
67:09 - actually do that will see is that you
67:11 - can have separate files that make up the
67:14 - brain so this thing that I'm talking
67:16 - about all these files can be a can have
67:21 - the dot rive extension and you could
67:23 - have many many many of these so you
67:25 - could have one file that just has a
67:27 - thousand substitutions in it and you
67:29 - could use that as part of the brain you
67:30 - could use that for multiple projects and
67:32 - and you could just carry that file along
67:33 - with you so once you've made one chatbot
67:36 - or you're using somebody else's chat bar
67:37 - you got an example chat bot you can
67:39 - divide things in different files to kind
67:40 - of keep organized and reuse stuff
67:44 - another key feature is variables so I
67:48 - think there's two more things that I
67:49 - want to talk about one is variables and
67:50 - one is sequencing so how do you do
67:52 - variables so I'm pretty sure that you
67:54 - can just do stuff like var var name
67:58 - equals computer and then I think
68:03 - nice to meet you star and and then so if
68:06 - the if the user says who are
68:08 - you you could say I am named I think
68:12 - this is how this works I'm actually kind
68:13 - of speculating I think you can set up a
68:15 - name and then you can say I am that name
68:19 - so let's see if that works
68:21 - who are you I am blank so that's not
68:25 - right so much for me just making up what
68:27 - rice group does let's look for it in the
68:29 - tutorial variables variables
68:34 - my name is hold on let's hold on
68:37 - Matthew I'm sorry to make you add at
68:39 - this let me so so that didn't work let
68:44 - me find it in the tutorial so hold on
68:46 - let me actually try to find it how do
68:49 - you set how do you said yeah var name
68:56 - equals tutorial and then and then where
69:04 - is it oh yeah this is good these are
69:10 - good all right you can do an or I'm
69:12 - gonna show this you can do optional you
69:18 - can do arrays all these things you can
69:20 - do but what I'm trying to do is how do
69:23 - you put a variable into the thing that's
69:35 - right knock knock is a great one it's an
69:39 - example here my name is set name set age
69:42 - get 8 you say get ah okay
69:52 - oops ah let me find that spot
70:04 - oops there's so many things sorry sorry
70:07 - everybody
70:07 - this is what happens when you don't
70:09 - prepare for class okay okay so I found
70:15 - this spot in the tutorial I apologize
70:17 - you have to if you want to display the
70:19 - value of variable you have to use get as
70:21 - well so what I missed here is I am get
70:25 - name so I'm gonna run this now and I'm
70:27 - gonna say who are you
70:29 - I am undefined how what did I get wrong
70:35 - okay Dwight what did I get wrong here
70:40 - set Nate I know you could say set me
70:44 - variables I just keep looking at the
70:49 - chat like someone's gonna like you I
70:52 - need I don't think I need it in quotes
70:53 - do I but I'm like scrolling like a crazy
70:58 - person here it's like scrolling up and
71:06 - down in this variables okay name yeah
71:14 - look at this huh why can't I just use
71:18 - okay oh by the way pound is not a
71:24 - comment it's slash slash I don't know I
71:26 - said pound how do I use the variable
71:32 - nice to meet you my name is Noah I know
71:37 - how to use set to set the variable know
71:43 - I can't believe someone just used the
71:46 - super chat keep it donation that's the
71:48 - most ridiculous thing ever that just
71:49 - happened thank you green person who
71:54 - currency is euros yeah come on come on
72:02 - come on come on what did I miss
72:07 - var name is it var name equals computer
72:11 - get name so I know I could well let's
72:21 - try putting I don't think putting this
72:22 - in quotes does anything who are yeah I
72:28 - have some examples why don't I go look
72:31 - at my examples so I have a chatbot
72:33 - workshop that I did boy this is really
72:45 - so let's look at this I should have
72:53 - looked at this first far name equals bot
72:57 - this means define that's what I put in
73:00 - my example and then I'm not using it
73:07 - here window
73:16 - botany really
73:27 - oh if it's not something I set it's
73:32 - actually this oh yeah
73:39 - all right thank you me I am so me
73:54 - so it appears that for the variables
73:57 - that you set up at the top you can
73:59 - actually retrieve their values not with
74:01 - get but with the keyword bot get is
74:04 - something that I'm going to show you in
74:05 - a minute that's four variables that
74:06 - you've set in a different way using set
74:08 - so maybe I'm missing a few important
74:10 - details here that I will try to get to
74:12 - but so what I need to do is if I want to
74:14 - retrieve that variable I use bot name so
74:16 - these are like kind of almost like fixed
74:19 - constants or settings for the particular
74:20 - bots so I can say now I can say who are
74:24 - are you and it can say I am computer the
74:28 - reason why this is useful is I could use
74:29 - bot name in all sorts of places in my
74:31 - chat bot and then I if I wanted to
74:33 - change its name later I could just
74:35 - change it at the top so it's a way of
74:36 - setting just like the reason why you
74:37 - might use variables and coding the same
74:40 - reason why you might use variables here
74:41 - now here's the interesting thing
74:42 - sometimes you might want to remember
74:44 - something the user says so for example
74:48 - let's say let's say what you what you
74:56 - though the user says my favorite
75:00 - favorite color is star now one thing I
75:04 - should mention is there ways of setting
75:06 - up specific options only that they're a
75:09 - valid like it has to be a number or it
75:11 - has to be a word or has to be one of
75:12 - these three words then you can have a
75:14 - different reply if it doesn't fit that
75:15 - that but but for right now I'm just
75:17 - gonna say my favorite color is anything
75:18 - and what I want to do is say oh I love
75:23 - and I can do set color equals star
75:26 - something like this too
75:29 - so this is this idea of in addition to
75:34 - displaying back what the user said I
75:37 - could store that in another variable now
75:39 - I might not have gotten this syntax
75:40 - exactly right let's go look at the
75:42 - tutorial so I'm gonna search for the
75:44 - part of the tutorial that's using set so
75:46 - yeah so set Nate
75:48 - set name equal star so actually what I
75:50 - should do is put this at the beginning
75:51 - and then I can say get if I want to
75:53 - actually use that and I could use that
75:54 - later too
75:55 - so for I did that wrong so let's do this
75:58 - was right set color equals star and then
76:02 - I could say oh I love get color
76:06 - - and let me give myself a bit more room
76:08 - here so that fits in one line I know I'm
76:11 - gonna be standing in front of it but we
76:14 - can see here okay so now what I could do
76:16 - is if the user says my favorite color is
76:21 - blue oh I love blue - but I haven't only
76:26 - spent sent something back to the user
76:28 - what I can actually say I am but who are
76:33 - you I am bought name and my favorite
76:36 - color is get color so this is a way now
76:40 - that the bot will always say back the
76:45 - same favorite color that the user has
76:47 - set so now we can say my favorite color
76:52 - is purple which is actually my favorite
76:54 - color and then I can say who are you I
76:56 - am a computer and my favorite color is
76:58 - purple so we can actually use stuff that
77:01 - the user is saying store that
77:02 - information and save it later so you
77:04 - could imagine if you're creating a pot
77:07 - to have a conversation over a period of
77:08 - time that's gonna remember stuff about
77:09 - the user this could be incredibly useful
77:13 - oh I'm sorry I need because it's a bot
77:18 - variable Thank You Simon tiger
77:21 - so the important thing here is the
77:24 - difference between bot variables which
77:26 - are the ones you set up at the top and
77:27 - other variables that you're setting
77:29 - during the conversation with set okay so
77:34 - there's a few other things I want to
77:35 - cover here let me look at my examples
77:37 - they're random multiple replies this is
77:41 - not so important so wild cards multiple
77:52 - things all right yeah oh yeah optionals
77:56 - is important so here oops
78:07 - so I have a set of examples that will
78:10 - include front links from this video that
78:12 - mostly pull from that tutorial I'm just
78:15 - gonna kind of show you those right now
78:16 - because we could spend forever like
78:17 - showing you each possible configuration
78:19 - but I think once you get the basic idea
78:21 - of how it works you can read through the
78:23 - documentation yourself and the key thing
78:25 - here that the key thing here that I want
78:36 - to demonstrate to you is the next step
78:38 - which is actually using this in your own
78:39 - program in JavaScript which is pretty
78:41 - exciting and interesting so this is some
78:43 - of an example that I have so I already
78:45 - talked to you about star which means
78:48 - match anything and you can you can say
78:51 - you could have different stars star one
78:52 - star two you can have a catch-all you
78:55 - can match only a number so if if the if
79:00 - it's not a number
79:01 - you could you could match you could you
79:03 - could say back like oh please give me a
79:05 - number
79:05 - you can match only A to Z characters you
79:08 - can have something optional like if the
79:10 - user says what is your phone number or
79:11 - what is your number optional anything is
79:15 - a nice way to match a topic so if so if
79:18 - the this is sort of us doing this
79:20 - earlier you can see if the user uses the
79:23 - word JavaScript anywhere can you teach
79:24 - me to program in JavaScript you can use
79:26 - in other so if the user says I love
79:29 - purple or I love pink you could say what
79:31 - about red so this is a lot of this
79:32 - you'll notice the syntax is very similar
79:34 - to regular expressions and you can also
79:36 - use an array so I was kind of mentioning
79:38 - this before right you can set up an
79:40 - array of different options and then you
79:43 - could say what if the user says to
79:45 - anything that matches anything from that
79:47 - array so there are so many Possible's
79:50 - possible configurations that's just a
79:53 - little bit I'm trying to think if I
79:55 - missed anything else that I wanted to
79:57 - show you in here learning I mentioned in
80:00 - terms of like saving information oh and
80:04 - you can also have conditionals so so
80:07 - this is really great so one thing let's
80:08 - try this actually so let's try to use I
80:11 - think the age is a good example
80:16 - where the bots think
80:18 - of a number and the user has to like
80:20 - guess the number so maybe actually
80:22 - that's what we'll do when I get to the
80:24 - JavaScript example so let's not worry
80:25 - too much about this right now you can
80:27 - see that if if the if the bot says and
80:31 - if the user sorry if the trigger is it's
80:33 - always very confusing I keep saying the
80:34 - wrong thing if the user says and my
80:36 - older than you if the users age that was
80:40 - set up here is greater than 10 say you
80:42 - are I am 10 if the users age is less
80:45 - than or equal to 10
80:47 - nope I am 10 so this is like saying that
80:48 - the bots age is 10 and incidentally I
80:51 - could make that a bot variable as well
80:54 - or a user set variable because maybe the
80:57 - user says how old the bot is I don't
80:59 - know so there's so many possibilities
81:00 - here I hope this gives you boy this is a
81:02 - really terribly disorganized
81:04 - introduction to Rive script I you know
81:06 - admittedly I was really figuring it out
81:08 - as I went I don't know write script that
81:09 - well but I kind of did this for myself
81:12 - to remind me how it is and what it does
81:13 - and now I want to take that next step
81:15 - and use rive script in a JavaScript
81:17 - program you could and you can use one of
81:20 - the things I love about writing scripts
81:21 - is it's open source it's MIT license and
81:23 - you can use it in a variety of
81:24 - programming languages I'm the user in
81:26 - JavaScript so I'll see you in the next
81:27 - video where I'm going to do that I saw
81:37 - somebody in the chat say something about
81:38 - this big boring yeah I feel a little
81:43 - like like I'm a little off my game today
81:45 - which I do I say every week but today
81:50 - [Music]
81:51 - okay yes rye script does support random
81:55 - numbers I think sort of
82:03 - boring boring boring okay so what I'm
82:06 - going to do now is hopefully gonna do
82:08 - something a little more interesting
82:11 - which is do I don't know whether this
82:15 - should be a coding challenge let's make
82:20 - this a coding challenge and have it be I
82:22 - mean the thing that I made already was a
82:23 - knock-knock joke thing oh it was
82:27 - sequencing I forgot to mention
82:28 - sequencing I'm not worried okay good
82:31 - thank you positive feedback cuz
82:35 - otherwise
82:35 - oh this cameras off it was gonna change
82:40 - to that otherwise I'm gonna be reduced
82:47 - to saying talking to you this way to
82:48 - make an s boring okay so she sees all
82:53 - right so let's I think I'm gonna do this
82:57 - as a coding challenge I'm going to
83:01 - generate it's five o'clock and then I'm
83:06 - going to so I'm not going to do the P 5
83:08 - speed stuff I'm going to try to do some
83:10 - more object videos today eight to one
83:18 - Astros Wow okay where am i I'm a desktop
83:27 - CD desktop p5 generate chat bot oh no no
83:32 - clear make directory chat bot o CD chat
83:39 - bot p5 generate - B how about a chat bot
83:48 - one okay so now Python I'm sorry Austin
83:54 - gives me tells me to learn to check out
83:56 - I I term - is that what it's called a
83:59 - really really really should do that but
84:01 - I'm just still just using simple HTTP
84:05 - server and localhost 8001
84:15 - minimize this open up atom and close
84:27 - this and go to I will get there
84:32 - eventually everybody chatbot I think
84:37 - this is lower than it usually is maybe
84:39 - it's not feel so much lower I mean
84:43 - that's too much table for you guys to
84:44 - see in the video
84:46 - okay chatbot one sketch a yes/no canvas
84:53 - and so one thing I want to do is that
85:01 - I'm going to just download the rive
85:03 - script JavaScript library in advance so
85:05 - that's not part of the actual video
85:07 - tutorial that I'll publish as part of
85:08 - this live stream so when I go to write
85:10 - script j/s and what I want is Oh No look
85:17 - I can just do it this way so I can
85:20 - always just link to it this way so I'm
85:21 - gonna do that
85:29 - so that will be there and there we go
85:41 - and okay alright how's the font size
85:47 - everybody font size okay I think feel
85:53 - like it needs to be a little bigger so
85:59 - the thing that I forgot to mention is
86:01 - sequencing oh you know it should be
86:05 - don't you think it should be that the
86:07 - bot has to guess the random number so
86:11 - we're thinking of the random number and
86:12 - the bot has to guess it hmm that's this
86:17 - is gonna be a hard one I should just do
86:20 - the knock-knock joke thing I mean that's
86:22 - an example from rive script I actually
86:26 - have no idea how to do this with the
86:27 - guessing the random number thing because
86:29 - oh no it's easy I just check whether
86:33 - it's equal less than or greater than and
86:35 - I have some other stuff about picking
86:37 - the random number and your name and
86:38 - whatever let's do it so who should who
86:40 - should pick the random number I should
86:42 - pick the random number cuz I know I'm
86:44 - saying their number and I have to figure
86:46 - out whether it's bigger or the bots know
86:49 - the bots picking the number is gonna be
86:51 - oh I could have an automatic thing who's
86:57 - the user pick it okay the bots gonna
86:59 - pick the number okay bot thinks of a
87:03 - number okay thank you everybody that's
87:05 - gonna do that all right oh you know what
87:09 - I want to do packages so there's a rive
87:14 - script syntax highlighter I'm so I'm
87:16 - gonna go to packages oh I already have
87:20 - it installed okay so this is I already
87:22 - have this rive script syntax highlighter
87:24 - installed okay and here I'm sketch that
87:29 - yes
87:29 - all right everybody you ready here we go
87:41 - pick them from the book of course so how
87:47 - do I feed it how do I feed it the random
87:51 - number
87:54 - but I could do I have a clever idea I
87:57 - think I know I have I have a crazy idea
87:59 - I've got an idea
88:01 - oh this is gonna be good this is gonna
88:02 - be good this is gonna be good okay I'm
88:04 - excited
88:10 - welcome to a coding challenge where I
88:13 - will make a cheese bot that thinks that
88:15 - a random number and then the user has to
88:18 - guess that ringing them that random
88:20 - number will be
88:21 - [Music]
88:28 - [Music]
88:34 - thank you very much okay
88:37 - so I already forgot what I said three
88:40 - 7155
88:41 - so I'm gonna do this in JavaScript I'm
88:44 - gonna say let let dot let dot no there's
88:47 - no that dot let number equal 37 Oh 555
88:53 - okay I guess the bots gonna think of a
88:55 - number between 0 and 999 thousand and
89:00 - the chat bot framework that I'm gonna
89:02 - use to create this bot is something
89:05 - called rive script and I made a really
89:07 - terrible video about rive script that
89:10 - you could go and watch if you haven't
89:12 - but I would probably recommend just go
89:13 - and look at the right script tutorial
89:15 - which will be linked on the right script
89:16 - website which would be linked in this
89:17 - video's description and so what I need
89:20 - to I need to do two things I need to
89:22 - program in JavaScript I need to
89:23 - configure my chat bot the brain of the
89:25 - chat bot right this is a diagram
89:30 - technical fail this is a diagram from my
89:32 - previous video where I have something a
89:35 - JavaScript program is going to feed
89:36 - input into the brain and the brain is
89:39 - going to give me a reply so I'm gonna do
89:40 - all this input and output in JavaScript
89:42 - but the brain is actually gonna be
89:44 - controlled by rive scripts so in order
89:46 - for that to happen I need to create a
89:48 - rive script file so I'm gonna say a new
89:50 - file and I'm gonna call it a brain drive
89:54 - there's I don't have to call it that I'm
89:57 - actually I have an atom package the atom
89:59 - drive script package which is doing
90:02 - syntax highlighting so I can do things
90:04 - like and I said in my previous video
90:05 - that a pound was a comment it's not so
90:08 - this is the chatbots brain so the first
90:11 - thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give the
90:13 - chat bot a specific number I have an
90:15 - idea for the number to be picked
90:16 - randomly each time but let's just start
90:19 - with specific random number in the chat
90:21 - bot so this is rive script syntax it
90:24 - looks like JavaScript but it's write
90:26 - script syntax and I'm gonna do something
90:29 - that just says so I'm gonna do a
90:34 - catch-all so I'm this is a trigger so
90:37 - this is so rife script if you didn't
90:39 - watch the previous video or don't know
90:40 - anything about it is a pattern matching
90:41 - system for chatbots so this is match any
90:44 - the user says that I don't match
90:46 - otherwise I'm gonna say the reply is
90:48 - going to be guess a number between zero
90:54 - and nine nine nine nine nine right so
90:57 - that's what the chat bot is going to say
90:58 - so actually let's leave this let's try
91:01 - to get the whole system working and then
91:03 - we'll come back and finish configuring
91:05 - the chat bot so how do I want to make
91:07 - this work well I want to have let's
91:10 - start putting some stuff in the HTML
91:11 - like chat bot and then I'm going to
91:14 - create a input user gonna call this user
91:19 - input and I'm gonna say say I'm gonna
91:24 - and then I'm going to create I'm going
91:31 - to create so this I'm just trying to put
91:32 - some stuff on the HTML page and I'm
91:35 - going to say reply I mean I'm not being
91:40 - thoughtful about the design here output
91:44 - and then I probably need like some sort
91:48 - of button that's like submit I mean like
91:50 - button ID equals submit button so again
91:56 - I'm being absolutely not very thoughtful
91:58 - about this interface but I'm just
92:00 - putting it let's see if what I wrote
92:01 - here in HTML will appear on the page
92:05 - there we go
92:08 - and the button should say submit great
92:12 - so this is the idea is that I'm gonna be
92:15 - able to say things like hello and hit
92:17 - submit and the chat BOTS gonna say
92:19 - something to me here in the reply
92:20 - obviously it's my hope that those of you
92:22 - watching this video will make something
92:24 - more creative and thoughtful about the
92:26 - design and eventually what I want to do
92:28 - is use a library called p5 speech to
92:32 - actually have all this happen with voice
92:33 - so but let's first make it work with
92:35 - text and I'll do another video to make
92:37 - it work with voice okay so how do I then
92:40 - so now I have my framework and well
92:44 - let's actually look we need to write
92:46 - some JavaScript I forgot about that part
92:48 - so let's go back to JavaScript and I
92:50 - don't need to draw a function and I'm
92:53 - gonna say let button equals select I
92:56 - called it some
92:58 - an idea submit I'm gonna say let user
93:03 - input equals select user input is the ID
93:08 - I gave it and what else do I need
93:11 - I need let output equals select output
93:15 - so now I have access to all of those Dom
93:17 - elements like I need the bunny to know
93:19 - when the user hits the button I need to
93:21 - know in the user what the user is said
93:22 - when they hit the button I need to build
93:24 - to put the reply somewhere so now I need
93:26 - a callback an event for whenever I click
93:28 - the button button Mouse pressed and I'm
93:32 - gonna call function called chat so I'm
93:34 - now going to write a function called
93:35 - chat and all I'm gonna do here I'm going
93:41 - to say input equals user input value so
93:45 - this is me getting the value what the
93:47 - user said and I'm gonna say output dot
93:50 - HTML input so I now have a parrot chat
93:54 - bot I have made a parrot chat bot all it
93:56 - ever will do is put back what the user
93:58 - says I haven't put the ride script brain
94:00 - into this program yet so now let's see
94:02 - if this is correct if I run this hello
94:05 - hello goodbye goodbye what's up
94:10 - question mark what's up so we can see
94:12 - here this is my very basic parrot chat
94:14 - bot I can read what the user says and I
94:16 - can give it a reply now what I want to
94:18 - do is have rive script act as the brain
94:20 - to tell me what the reply should
94:23 - actually be well time out I think
94:28 - somebody's at the door
94:28 - oh hello I'm yes I'm actually live right
94:34 - now
94:35 - you can't nobody can see you but they
94:37 - could hear you oh I got it for Jeff
94:41 - already I uploaded it oh I just haven't
94:44 - emailed it to you guys but I will okay
94:46 - perfect no problem
94:50 - that was a very famous guest star that
94:53 - just appeared on the coding train let's
94:55 - see if anybody could guess who that was
94:56 - if anybody heard that conversation okay
95:00 - so where was I in this video I oh this
95:09 - hasn't happened for you guys in real
95:10 - time yet
95:11 - now I'm seeing that okay I'll say who
95:19 - that was later another time let's see if
95:20 - anybody can guess okay uh was not Lady
95:26 - gaga that was a good lady we was Elijah
95:28 - the prophet no anyway as you open the
95:31 - door whatever okay so where was I
95:36 - okay now it's time for us to add that
95:39 - brain so I'm gonna go to the right
95:42 - script github page and this is actually
95:44 - in this particular repository called
95:47 - rive script J s so write scripts is a
95:49 - generic syntax for configuring a chat
95:52 - bot that you can then use in a variety
95:54 - of different programming languages
95:55 - environments I want to use it in
95:57 - JavaScript so all I need to do and one
95:59 - thing I've done already that I should
96:01 - have mentioned is I've imported the rive
96:04 - script library so here i've imported the
96:07 - rice script library just from a URL i
96:09 - could download it but i must have a
96:10 - reference to that rice script javascript
96:12 - library so i've done that is and it's
96:14 - covered in that github page and then I'm
96:16 - really just gonna say load file so no
96:19 - first I'm going to create a bot so I'm
96:21 - gonna go here and I'm gonna say let bot
96:26 - equal new rye script then I'm gonna say
96:29 - load file and my file is just called
96:33 - brain drive and I'm gonna I need to
96:38 - callbacks ready brain ready and brain
96:46 - error being very inconsistent of my
96:48 - naming of stuff so I'm now gonna write
96:50 - those callbacks brain ready console dot
96:54 - log chat bot ready and then I'm going to
96:59 - say brain error console dot log chat bot
97:07 - error and I'm sure I could there's
97:10 - probably an argument I could get some
97:11 - information about the error but let's
97:13 - just add this right now and let's just
97:15 - see if I now run this uncaught dollar
97:20 - sign is not defined
97:22 - so I have an error somehow
97:25 - let's take a look maybe I need to say at
97:29 - the top of version right I was doing
97:33 - this before let's say version 2 probably
97:35 - I might need this the top of the brain
97:39 - and let's go back no ok
97:42 - debugging time debugging debugging
97:46 - debugging time debugging time hmm what's
97:51 - wrong here dollar sign is not defined
97:58 - let me look at my actual example
98:11 - oh did I type the name wrong name of the
98:13 - file oh my god brain drive Oh brah
98:18 - look everybody in the chat sorry
98:23 - apparently I named my chat bot Brian
98:26 - without realizing it the name is brain
98:29 - not Brian the life of brain okay here we
98:33 - go let's try this now ah oh I know what
98:40 - the problem is I know what the problem
98:43 - is what could possibly dollar sign is
98:45 - not defined mean what javascript library
98:50 - uses dollar sign as a key term jQuery I
98:55 - think that rive script depent the rive
98:57 - script JavaScript library depends on
98:59 - jQuery and I have it imported jQuery
99:01 - that must be the problem right so it's
99:04 - not even loading the file it hasn't even
99:05 - gotten to the air and error in the file
99:06 - yet so if I want to load jQuery let's
99:10 - find a way to do that and I should be
99:14 - able to I don't know jQuery minified
99:17 - copy this copy I need to blow jQuery in
99:22 - my index.html file so and I can do that
99:25 - via URL so oops ah let's grab this come
99:32 - on people help me out here with some
99:34 - copy pasting this should copy it copy to
99:36 - clipboard copied it's not copying it to
99:39 - clipboard
99:40 - I hope this part gets edited out okay so
99:50 - okay so now I've imported jQuery as well
99:53 - here's the thing so JavaScript files
99:56 - that a web page uses can be loaded just
99:59 - like this is the code that I'm writing
100:00 - it's it's get Dutch yes these are some
100:02 - p5 libraries that I'm using but they're
100:04 - actually locally stored on the computer
100:06 - there are some other libraries but I'm
100:07 - getting them from a URL all these things
100:09 - are possible I don't know there's
100:10 - probably some nice good best practices
100:12 - here that somebody who knows something
100:13 - about programming will tell you but I'm
100:15 - just gonna make it work okay so now
100:17 - let's go back hit refresh chatbot ready
100:20 - okay so the chat bot is ready so now
100:24 - what do I do next
100:25 - what I want all I need to do is here in
100:28 - this chat and I probably should make you
100:31 - know if I were being really careful
100:33 - about this I would write some code to
100:35 - make sure the brain had been loaded
100:37 - before the bot tries to reply but I
100:40 - think it's very unlikely that a user is
100:42 - gonna be able to submit something before
100:44 - the bots actually loaded so but I'm
100:46 - gonna show you there's something I'm
100:47 - gonna have to add to this later that I
100:48 - think it's gonna be a little bit of an
100:49 - issue okay so what I'm going to do is I
100:53 - am going to I have code you alright so I
101:00 - need to ask the bot for a reply I'm
101:01 - pretty sure this is gonna this is gonna
101:03 - be here just in this page and oh
101:05 - interesting so I think that I might
101:10 - actually need this the replies have to
101:12 - be sorted to be honest I have no idea
101:14 - what that does but I imagine this is
101:17 - some sort of like processing element so
101:22 - let's add this in and so let's add this
101:28 - in under brain ready I'm gonna sort the
101:32 - replies and then what I want to do is I
101:35 - want to say let reply equal bot reply
101:39 - input now I think this actually isn't
101:41 - going to work I think I need to say I
101:44 - think if I look at the code example here
101:47 - local user I forget what this does but I
101:52 - need to give the first argument as local
101:55 - user so I want to say let input equals
101:58 - user input value and bot reply love it
102:00 - so let's see what happens now I think I
102:01 - did everything
102:04 - hello guess the number between so no
102:07 - matter what I do it's just gonna say
102:09 - guess the number between 0 and 99 99 so
102:12 - now aha so what do i what what else do I
102:16 - need in this chat bot so for example
102:18 - what if the user says any number great
102:25 - guess I like the number star-1 so this
102:30 - isn't a star but this is a wild card
102:32 - just like this is a wild card but this
102:35 - is a wild card that only will match
102:37 - number so now if I reload this again if
102:41 - I say anything I'm gonna say guessing
102:43 - number but if I say 100 great guess I
102:46 - like the number 100 let me make this a
102:47 - little bit bigger so we can see I'm
102:49 - starting he could figure the bot to do
102:51 - certain things now what I really want to
102:53 - do is use a conditional so I want to say
102:57 - something like if star 1 is greater than
103:06 - is greater than bot num then I'm going
103:12 - to I need an equals here I don't even
103:13 - remember then I'm going to say pick a
103:16 - higher a lower number and if it's less
103:23 - than I don't know if I've got the syntax
103:26 - right here pick a higher number and
103:28 - again you can go and read the raj script
103:30 - tutorial heart watch my previous video
103:32 - that wasn't very good nothing this one's
103:34 - any good and then I could say oh I'm
103:38 - sorry what am I doing here I'm in the
103:40 - wrong I'm totally in the wrong place
103:42 - oh no no I'm in the right place I just
103:44 - don't know if I have the syntax right
103:45 - and then if it's equal you got it you
103:52 - got it
103:52 - so let's go to the Rice script tutorial
103:55 - which is here and let's look for
103:59 - conditional condition condition
104:02 - additional so this is a way I can have
104:07 - the bot set something and what I'm
104:10 - looking for is like this here we go ah
104:15 - what I get age is greater than 25 this
104:20 - is what you can do so this is what I
104:21 - want I have I want this conditional and
104:23 - I need the equals like almost like the
104:25 - arrow syntax the equals greater than so
104:28 - I want to say equals like this so I
104:33 - think this should work let's see if this
104:37 - is right and let's let's take a look
104:42 - here oh these are stars so I guess I
104:45 - need stars if I'm going to do a
104:46 - conditional
104:51 - and syntax highlighting is doing
104:53 - something weird which and the equal
104:55 - should be double equals I guess there we
104:57 - go so I think maybe this is right now
104:59 - okay let's see
105:02 - and I don't don't need to say star one
105:04 - cuz there's only star so let's see
105:06 - what's the chance I've gotten this right
105:11 - so things are still working is telling
105:15 - me to guess the number I'm gonna guess
105:16 - the number 10 pick a higher number I'm
105:19 - gonna guess the number 9 9 9 9 9 9
105:21 - pick a lower number I'm gonna guess the
105:23 - number 37 5 5 5 you got it okay
105:31 - we should probably do more with this bot
105:33 - like it should have a name and it should
105:34 - be able to respond to other things but
105:36 - one thing I want to do is so why am I
105:38 - doing this I don't know I've really lost
105:40 - track of that but one reason why I'm
105:43 - doing this is if I combine rye Script
105:47 - and JavaScript I can make use of the
105:49 - powerful pieces of Drive script and
105:53 - JavaScript together so what I could do
105:56 - is I could actually have JavaScript I
105:59 - don't think there's a way for write
106:00 - script easily to pick a random number it
106:01 - probably is but just for the sake of
106:04 - argument what if I oh it's funny how I
106:08 - had this here so what if I actually say
106:11 - let num equal floor random nine nine
106:16 - nine nine nine so and then I'm going to
106:19 - and actually what I'm saying is 100,000
106:23 - oh and I need to know the parentheses
106:26 - now I'm going to just console.log that
106:28 - number let's just what I want is for
106:31 - JavaScript to pick the random number
106:35 - there so it's picking a random number
106:37 - each time and maybe I need to make this
106:39 - a little bigger so you can see it right
106:42 - so how can I pass something that
106:44 - javascript picked to the bot well I'm
106:48 - asking
106:49 - I'm sending things to the bot from the
106:52 - user but I don't actually have to I
106:54 - could send stuff from the bot from my
106:56 - program as well so there's no reason why
106:58 - I couldn't actually just do this when
107:00 - the chat bot is ready
107:05 - and then what if what I send to the bot
107:12 - is let reply equal bot dot wouldn't it
107:18 - what is what is the function bot reply
107:20 - user lok local is it something like that
107:23 - i don't know i can't remember the local
107:24 - user set plus the number so what I'm
107:33 - doing is I'm sending to the bot I'm
107:35 - telling the bot like a secret message
107:37 - the code is sending a message to the bot
107:39 - not me the actual user typing saying set
107:42 - number so what I now want to do is if
107:45 - and of course this is very easily
107:47 - hackable don't get me wrong
107:49 - set number is a message where now I the
107:55 - bot will set and we don't need this a
107:59 - hard-coded variable anymore set num
108:03 - equal star so this will actually and I
108:09 - don't did I get this syntax right looks
108:12 - like something might be weird but I
108:13 - think I got it right so set Nam equals
108:15 - star and then now I can change this from
108:17 - bot num to get numb so let's see and I
108:20 - don't know let's make this pick a number
108:21 - between but between 1 and 10 just to
108:26 - like make things a little simpler here
108:28 - so this is gonna be a guess a number
108:29 - between 1 and 10
108:43 - between one and ten and now the number
108:47 - will be here plus one because this is
108:49 - gonna give you a number between zero and
108:50 - nine and so and let's actually let's
108:56 - look at that number so we can cheat so
108:59 - to speak to make sure this is working
109:00 - and let's run this now okay so we'd pick
109:04 - the number four I can see that in the in
109:06 - the in the console so if I say one no
109:10 - reply found so what happened here brain
109:16 - so this is wrong this is clearly the
109:19 - wrong syntax let's go back to the rive
109:23 - script tutorial and we can see here a
109:29 - set name oh you know what it is you
109:32 - probably doesn't want any white space
109:33 - their set name equal formal formal by
109:38 - the way this is a way to keep that the
109:40 - case sensitivity of what the users typed
109:42 - there's all sorts of things and and so I
109:46 - can say set num let's see where was that
109:53 - set name equals formal let's just paste
109:57 - this in here to make sure I'm using the
109:58 - right syntax set num equal star so let's
110:04 - try this pick a higher number nine pick
110:11 - a lower number eight pick a lower number
110:14 - seven
110:16 - you got it too so you know I'm hacking
110:25 - it basically but pick a higher number
110:27 - pick a lower number so probably I don't
110:30 - know if this is the best solution there
110:31 - might be a different way to pass that
110:32 - value to the brain but certainly if I
110:35 - wanted to do it this way I could come up
110:37 - with like a really strange thing that
110:39 - the user would probably never type
110:41 - that's almost like a secret code to set
110:43 - a particular value that I'm getting from
110:45 - JavaScript so so anyway um there's more
110:49 - that could be done with this I've missed
110:50 - so many pieces
110:51 - thing that I actually missed that's
110:53 - important about chat bots are sequencing
110:55 - so one thing you can do is what if I
110:59 - have an example that's a knock-knock
111:01 - joke
111:01 - bot and so and that's actually from rive
111:04 - script I encourage you to check that out
111:06 - on the tutorial let's actually look for
111:08 - it but you can see something that's
111:11 - important here is about is the previous
111:14 - command so in other words the wild-card
111:20 - you want to you basically the user in a
111:23 - knock-knock joke the user can say
111:25 - anything I could just paste this in the
111:27 - user can say anything but there'd be the
111:30 - chat BOTS gonna say something different
111:32 - based on where you are in the sequence
111:34 - of the knock-knock joke so this is
111:35 - saying this is what the user this is
111:38 - what the chat bot should reply with
111:40 - after who is there has already happened
111:44 - and this is what should the chatbox
111:46 - reply after who so that's important okay
111:48 - I went off track there so here is my
111:51 - number guessing chat bot with rice
111:54 - script and p5 I would love to see what
111:57 - kind of different chat BOTS you make
111:59 - with this same framework you know what
112:01 - happens if you like start querying api's
112:03 - and get there like the weather and have
112:04 - the bot talk about stuff and different
112:06 - topics or it's a programming questions
112:07 - or I don't know what you can make this
112:08 - bot do but I look forward to seeing what
112:10 - you guys create from this video to say
112:13 - that again I feel like I look forward to
112:16 - seeing what you create from this video
112:21 - losing my mind I look I look forward to
112:24 - seeing what you create from this video
112:26 - and in the next video I'm going to take
112:30 - exactly this I don't know if I'm gonna
112:31 - do this in the next video but in the
112:32 - next video or two I'm gonna do exactly
112:34 - this but with speech recognition so this
112:37 - conversation this guessing game could
112:38 - happen just purely in an auditory if
112:42 - that's the right word audio way okay
112:44 - things are clicking all over the place
112:45 - see you soon good bye
112:50 - okay oh there's some interesting thing
112:57 - happening in the chat alright so
113:00 - hopefully this was useful for people
113:01 - look at this you can make a chat bot so
113:03 - easy a game
113:05 - guessing thing look how easy that was
113:07 - and I didn't even use any neural network
113:09 - involved with any of this stuff I don't
113:13 - know what are you talking about rounded
113:14 - up to the nearest ten million me I am so
113:16 - me okay
113:24 - so what time is it 5:35 I how long have
113:31 - I been live streaming am i at two hours
113:34 - already I two hours is generally my
113:36 - limit let me see what I'm gonna do in
113:39 - terms of this object stuff that I want
113:43 - to keep going with because oh you okay
113:48 - topic discussion in the patron live
113:51 - channel I really like it's you totally
113:54 - can you don't listen to me that should
113:55 - be your channel to enjoy yourself to
113:56 - talk about anything you want but those I
113:58 - got confused okay I feel like there
114:01 - should be like a live channel that I
114:04 - should see in a live channel that I
114:05 - shouldn't see close the span what did I
114:10 - miss
114:14 - whoops open recent chat BOTS oh sorry
114:23 - thank you there we go alright 3:05 a.m.
114:31 - in India and by the way the audio has
114:34 - the audio the audio is good alright
114:36 - let's see here
114:38 - so now you've made a chat but let's I'm
114:43 - right I'm going back to object stuff
114:44 - please hold
114:51 - [Music]
115:15 - you know when your hands are covered in
115:17 - flour or ooh chicken gizzard this is
115:31 - these are the new video I'm going
115:33 - through and slowly replacing and leaving
115:35 - online my older videos object-oriented
115:39 - program in es6 so this definitely needs
115:44 - to be redone arrays of objects but
115:47 - before I get to that I also was gonna do
115:50 - this like more on objects video which is
115:58 - remember I had this list let's see if I
116:01 - have it it's whoops go back let me come
116:09 - over here oh sorry this camera went off
116:19 - very hard to erase to use pressure on
116:23 - the board this eraser is also terrible
116:28 - but not so bad grey wizard and the chat
116:33 - will be reminding me to get a better
116:34 - eraser right about now so the things
116:40 - that I wanted to I mean the things that
116:42 - I want to eventually get to are so in
116:46 - this is a video that I imagine that's
116:48 - more on objects what are the things that
116:53 - I want to include
116:55 - [Music]
116:58 - let me go to once again here and looking
117:07 - for learning processing and I'm looking
117:12 - for object-oriented programming okay
117:16 - okay and more on objects particle class
117:21 - objects as data for other objects
117:24 - overloading and objects communicating
117:26 - with other objects make a robot already
117:33 - overloading hmm actually what I want to
117:37 - do is clickable so I think the objects
117:39 - communicating with other objects is
117:40 - almost more interesting once I have an
117:42 - array because if I go I'm trying to
117:45 - figure out what videos I'm gonna make
117:46 - here and that's I know I have clicking
117:48 - on objects adding and removing objects
117:52 - deleting objects checking I have all
117:54 - about here so actually maybe I should do
118:00 - all those that's what I did with you
118:05 - could do all those things once I already
118:07 - have an array so maybe that makes sense
118:10 - so is there actually doesn't make sense
118:12 - for anything else to come after these
118:16 - three because the next thing I want to
118:20 - do is a raise of objects okay I think
118:26 - it's still off topic and the chat is
118:27 - about Internet Explorer okay all right
118:32 - so I think what I'm gonna do who who
118:36 - wants to humor me and this is the video
118:41 - I'm replacing so I need to watch this
118:42 - for a sec okay so now I've made two
118:45 - videos one just about what is an array
118:47 - in the syntax of an array and the other
118:49 - video looking at how to use a loop to
118:52 - iterate over every element in that array
118:54 - and in this video I want to unlock this
118:57 - great power to you which is how to take
119:00 - an object and duplicate that object many
119:03 - times into an array so first this is
119:05 - viscera again that's all I need to know
119:07 - okay so that's what I do
119:09 - oh geez that I'm kind of redoing old
119:11 - content but I got to get to this
119:12 - sometime because look at this look at
119:15 - this horrible thing that I've done can
119:18 - you believe this nonsense that I'm
119:19 - making this like literal object and I'm
119:21 - like copy oh nobody should ever watch
119:22 - this video and try to learn programming
119:23 - from it Oh horrible okay
119:31 - so but I did get it just to revisit this
119:33 - is what I'm talking about how would you
119:34 - make so what I need to do now is close
119:44 - this close this close this and I need to
119:51 - please hold
119:52 - [Music]
121:04 - okay I am now ready oh is the music very
121:09 - loud sorry sorry sorry sorry I can't
121:18 - like get it right cuz all right
121:23 - [Music]
121:27 - sorry about that
121:29 - I just Boston saying advice as well take
121:32 - 10 minutes to install I term actor
121:34 - there's I term I'm gonna do I turn right
121:37 - before I do Chrome extensions no I'm
121:39 - gonna do it it's just it's so hard to
121:41 - like oh no bad me okay um
121:49 - ready here we go hello it's me again
121:54 - your friendly neighborhood coding person
121:57 - who made some bubbles so if you were
121:59 - watching some previous videos a while
122:01 - back I made these bubble objects and
122:04 - there they are they're moving around the
122:06 - street and then there were some videos
122:07 - where I look kind of different which
122:10 - were about arrays just like a raise of
122:12 - numbers and raise of strings and like
122:14 - it's a list of things and things have
122:16 - indices so why am I here now I'm here in
122:18 - this video because I have this goal I
122:21 - have this goal in life which is to say I
122:23 - have defined what it means to be a
122:25 - bubble
122:26 - I made a bubble class I made a bubble
122:29 - object and I made two bubble objects
122:32 - bubble one and bubble two and I would
122:36 - like to be able to make five bubble
122:37 - objects and I would like to not have to
122:40 - do this because I would also like to
122:43 - make five hundred or a thousand or ten
122:45 - thousand I want to be able to
122:48 - make as many duplicate as many objects
122:50 - as I want create as many objects as I
122:51 - want from that template from that class
122:54 - without having to have all these
122:55 - separate variables and wouldn't you just
122:58 - isn't it just so convenient that I'm
123:01 - right here
123:02 - having just talked about objects and
123:03 - arrays if I just put those two things
123:04 - together we'll be in good shape so let's
123:06 - do that I don't think I need to yeah
123:10 - okay so let's just do that oh no don't
123:12 - go over there okay so so I'm gonna
123:14 - change this from one variable to Beryl's
123:16 - to a single variable called bubbles now
123:19 - remember when I want a variable to hold
123:22 - an array a list of information instead
123:25 - of making it equal to something like an
123:27 - object or a number
123:29 - I set it equal to open closed brackets
123:33 - there's other ways you can create an
123:35 - array also but this is a pretty
123:36 - conventional way now what I might do is
123:39 - I might say okay I have this array in
123:45 - theory I have this array that I could
123:47 - fill why don't I put a bubble in index
123:51 - zero and a bubble in index one so I'm
123:55 - going to put my bubble here and put my
123:56 - bubble here make two bubble objects
123:58 - instead of having separate variables
124:01 - bubble one bubble - I am going to have a
124:06 - variable bubbles index 0 because
124:10 - remember the first spot in the array is
124:12 - 0 not 1 so it was kind of bad that when
124:15 - I was doing this idea in the bubble 1
124:16 - and bubble - I should really name the
124:18 - double 0 and bubble 1 so the first thing
124:20 - I could do is just change this program
124:22 - to say like hey bubbles zero bubbles
124:27 - 1 bubbles 0 this is bubbles 0 you get
124:36 - the idea right one oh this is all why am
124:40 - I even bothering with this bubbles one
124:42 - oh no look at this
124:44 - this is bubbles zero and one and this is
124:46 - bubbles zero in one ah oh my goodness oh
124:49 - my gosh no wait a second stop the
124:53 - presses I'm so confused
124:55 - I think what I would prefer to do is
124:56 - move 0 and 1 and then
124:59 - chosen one so of course I could do this
125:01 - in any order but I want to move the
125:03 - first one and and by the way this is not
125:06 - going to be the solution because even
125:08 - though this now works and I have the
125:10 - same exact result the only thing that
125:12 - I've done differently is that instead of
125:15 - having two separate variables I have one
125:17 - array but I'm still referencing the two
125:19 - separate bubble objects individually so
125:21 - if I want to have ten of them I still
125:23 - have to keep adding more and more lines
125:25 - of code so what I want to do is I want
125:28 - to use that for loop if I say for let I
125:34 - equals zero I is less than some number I
125:40 - plus plus then inside here I can refer
125:46 - to that array called bubbles instead of
125:49 - saying hard-coding in zero hard-coding
125:52 - in one if I just say bubbles index I
125:55 - this is going to repeat many times with
125:58 - a different value for I I is zero then
126:00 - it's 1 then it's two then it's three so
126:03 - this is a way of me iterating accessing
126:05 - every single element of that array so I
126:07 - can use that too and by the way I know I
126:10 - know there's like a for each sort of
126:12 - thing and maybe I'll make a video about
126:14 - that but I'm gonna just use a nice for
126:16 - loop with a counter variable so I'm
126:18 - gonna today for let I equals 0 eyes less
126:22 - than 2 I plus plus and now instead of
126:28 - referencing the bubbles individually I'm
126:31 - going to just say bubbles index high
126:35 - which means I can now do this
126:39 - bubbles index I that same loop later and
126:44 - draw this is to use a loop to create the
126:46 - bubble objects and set up I can say
126:48 - bubbles index I'd move bubbles index I
126:52 - dot I don't even remember anymore a show
126:55 - is that what it was show we can look in
126:58 - the bubble class if I forgotten where's
127:01 - the bubbles class oh here it is
127:03 - move and show oh boy what happened here
127:06 - wait hold on hold on that shouldn't be
127:10 - there that was like me too
127:13 - guessing something sold on move and show
127:18 - what was that we would show what was
127:22 - what this show is the show mightier
127:24 - please edit this somehow move show was
127:27 - it show we could scroll down and look at
127:29 - the bubble claw MC move and show okay so
127:31 - those were the names of the functions
127:32 - that I used in that bubble class so now
127:35 - let's run this again oops
127:38 - and here we go so look at that ah now I
127:42 - still have two bubbles but one was big
127:45 - one was small before and then one was
127:47 - they were both there were different
127:49 - spots I lost that so one of the things
127:51 - that I had in my previous example if I
127:53 - just go back to here is I had specified
127:56 - exact locations for each bubble object
127:59 - and exact sizes and now that I have a
128:03 - loop I'm in a much happier place in that
128:06 - I can easily make 20 of these but it's
128:08 - what do I do about initializing all that
128:11 - stuff so this thing is here hello
128:13 - welcome to programming the reason why
128:16 - I'm coding here is not because I want to
128:19 - specifically set some exact locations
128:21 - for bubbles more likely I want to come
128:23 - up with some kind of algorithm like I
128:25 - want all the bubbles to appear in a
128:27 - perfect grid or I want them all to
128:29 - appear randomly or I want them to be in
128:30 - a grid that's slightly offset randomly
128:32 - or I want them to appear in a spiral
128:34 - pattern I want them all to start in the
128:35 - same place so what is that algorithm so
128:38 - let me just say so one thing I could do
128:39 - is I could use the fact that I have this
128:40 - counter I and I could say let X equal
128:43 - like well what if I start the bubbles
128:46 - starting on at like pixel ten and then
128:50 - add space them out by like 30 pixels you
128:54 - know so this kind of came to me and
128:55 - immediately because I've done this so
128:57 - many times but this is now a formula
128:59 - that when I is 0 X will equal 10 when I
129:02 - is 1 X will equal 10 plus 30 times 140
129:05 - and if I ever got to to which one in
129:07 - this case it would be 10 plus 1670 right
129:11 - so this idea of spacing the bubbles out
129:13 - so I could made 3 of them and by the way
129:18 - and then of course instead of
129:19 - hard-coding this value here I could say
129:21 - X I could use this variable to pass in
129:24 - which is calculated everything and then
129:25 - by the way this is really
129:27 - so one thing that's bad about this is
129:29 - now if I if I'm creating three bubbles
129:32 - all of a sudden right then I left this
129:35 - number two here so what I want to do is
129:38 - say bubbles dot length so this way
129:40 - however now I can't use bubbles dot
129:42 - length here because the array when I
129:44 - first started was empty so I'm adding
129:46 - things to the array a certain number of
129:48 - them then I can retrieve that length
129:49 - later and again there are different ways
129:51 - you can approach how many spots there
129:53 - are and how you store the length but
129:55 - this is just a way that i'ma do it for
129:56 - this example
129:57 - so now let's look at this you can see
130:00 - look at them they started now let's not
130:02 - move them just so we can see you can see
130:05 - there they are spaced out and I could
130:06 - easily just say well actually I want to
130:08 - space them out by a hundred pixels and I
130:10 - want them just to be 20 pixels in and
130:12 - you can see there we go and I want them
130:14 - to actually start at least 20 pixels in
130:17 - and you can see there they are and then
130:19 - I want to have ten of them there we go
130:22 - but I can't really have ten of them you
130:24 - get the idea and now I could put back in
130:26 - move and there they go
130:30 - so this is a way and I but what hello do
130:34 - you do something kind of exciting about
130:35 - this video which is that I haven't once
130:38 - changed any of the code down here this
130:41 - idea of a single bubble has remained
130:43 - exactly the same the thing that's
130:45 - different now is that I can create them
130:47 - and put them in an array and however
130:49 - many there are I could just move it show
130:51 - over so I'm gonna show you a few more
130:55 - things here now here's another thing I
130:57 - could do let's actually just make them
130:59 - let's let's just sort of prove this
131:00 - point let's give them all random spots
131:02 - and again I could set them randomly in
131:05 - the constructor but I'm just going to do
131:08 - it here so I'm gonna give them all a
131:13 - random I'm going to just create a whole
131:14 - bunch of bubbles with random locations
131:16 - and we can see in random sizes and you
131:19 - can see there they are but this is what
131:20 - I'm talking about now I have this one
131:22 - program here
131:24 - it makes ten bubbles I want this program
131:27 - to now make 100 how how many keys on the
131:32 - keyboard do I need to hit in order to
131:33 - make this change one if I programmed
131:37 - everything correctly all I need to do
131:40 - is at a zero here and suddenly I have a
131:44 - hundred of them and if I add another
131:46 - zero suddenly I have a thousand of them
131:49 - now my program is slowing down because
131:51 - it has to render and draw a lot of stuff
131:56 - hold on did I mess something up oh no
131:59 - people you guys are just distract me in
132:01 - the chat like I have a mistake in my
132:03 - code but it's just the autofill that
132:05 - Adam is doing that for you're talking
132:06 - about yeah why is it doing that
132:09 - okay sorry now my program might be
132:14 - slowing down because it's drawing a lot
132:17 - of bubbles and it's a lot to draw and
132:20 - you know I could sort of start thinking
132:21 - about what I really want to do here
132:23 - maybe actually what I want is for these
132:25 - bubbles not to have a stroke but I want
132:29 - them to have a fill with quite a bit of
132:32 - alpha and I could take this out of here
132:35 - and now I've got this sort of like
132:38 - cloudy thing going on so again I can use
132:41 - this idea what I'm really doing here is
132:43 - I'm kind of on the way to building
132:44 - something called a particle system I'm
132:46 - building a system of many individual
132:48 - elements that together make some sort of
132:50 - effect like a smoky cloudy thing but I
132:53 - could just with a with one variable now
132:55 - with one value change how many things
132:57 - are in there now here's the thing what
132:58 - if I'm gonna do one more thing in this
133:00 - video and I'm gonna I'm gonna actually
133:03 - put the bubble back to have that so
133:08 - let's just go back to where I was with
133:11 - just start with ten bubbles ten bubbles
133:15 - now what if what if I take this out of
133:18 - setup entirely it's gone what's gonna
133:22 - happen what's my program going to do
133:26 - nothing emptiest no but no emptiness no
133:29 - bubbles what if what I want to do is add
133:31 - bubbles when I click the mouse okay
133:33 - let's think about this the first thing
133:36 - that I might want to do is figure out
133:39 - where I can wear code executes when I
133:41 - click the mouse so that is that I want
133:43 - to add function mousepressed now whoops
133:48 - sorry
133:49 - now what do I want to do I want to make
133:51 - a bubble let be equal
133:53 - new bubble and I want that bubble to be
133:56 - where the mouse is and maybe it has a
133:59 - random size between 10 and 50 pixels so
134:04 - I've Nate I've and I don't love these 1
134:05 - character variables I should do better
134:07 - than that but I've picked a random
134:08 - number and I've made a new bubble what
134:10 - if I want to put that bubble in the
134:12 - array well I could say something like
134:14 - bubbles index 0 equals B right I could
134:17 - say I the first spot in the array put
134:19 - that bubble when I click the mouse look
134:22 - I only have one though because what I'm
134:24 - doing here is every single time I'm
134:27 - making a new bubble and putting it in
134:28 - the first spot but if this were a
134:30 - counter and it went up every single time
134:32 - I could put the first bubble in the
134:34 - first spot the next bubble in the second
134:36 - spot the next bubble in the third spot
134:38 - but I could do even better than that
134:40 - there's actually a function there's a
134:41 - lot of functions associated with arrays
134:43 - arrays are actually objects too that
134:45 - allow you to do certain things I'm gonna
134:46 - get to them I can delete stuff I can
134:48 - move stuff around I can shuffle I can
134:49 - sort but what I'm going to do is I'm
134:51 - gonna use this function called push push
134:55 - is a function that means add something
134:57 - to the array push it to the array and
135:00 - actually by default it's going to push
135:02 - it to the end of the array so now that I
135:04 - have that every time I click I add a new
135:11 - bubble and what's interesting about this
135:13 - is there's no there's a there's no limit
135:18 - to the number of bubbles I can have
135:19 - other than the computer speed and memory
135:20 - and interestingly enough I might just as
135:22 - a little effect change this to Mouse
135:24 - dragged and you can see now and I drag
135:27 - the mouse I'm kind of drawing this this
135:31 - kind of array of bubble objects okay so
135:34 - this is all about making an array of
135:36 - objects so if you're following along
135:38 - maybe you had an object you made some
135:39 - variation of the bubble you made a
135:41 - bouncing ball you made some kind of
135:42 - flying pig I don't know what it is you
135:45 - made a rainbow heart take that don't
135:49 - don't make any changes in your class at
135:51 - all try to write a program where you
135:53 - duplicate it in an array and you can
135:55 - just change one number and you can have
135:56 - 500 versus a thousand versus 10 see if
135:59 - you can add them with clicking the mouse
136:00 - or hitting the keyboard or some type of
136:02 - maybe what happened what if you try to
136:04 - like add
136:05 - every 10 seconds how would you do that
136:07 - what kind of event can trigger the
136:09 - adding of an object and then what I want
136:12 - to do in a future video which maybe will
136:14 - be the next one is how could I delete
136:16 - these when I click on them or how do I
136:19 - even know how do I communicate for all
136:21 - just a couple things how do I know if
136:23 - these bubbles are intersecting with each
136:24 - other so I want objects to talk to other
136:26 - objects and I also want to be able to
136:27 - talk to the objects bubbles you bubble
136:31 - hello bubble that's me talking to the
136:33 - objects I guess but I don't miss a alexa
136:36 - that's not a bubbles name's not alexa
136:38 - anyway what was I talking about
136:42 - oh so I want to be able to figure out
136:45 - how do I interact with the bubbles 10
136:47 - each bubble have its own mouth pressed
136:49 - kind of like event how does that work so
136:51 - I got to get to that sort of stuff and
136:52 - that'll come in a future video thanks
136:54 - for watching
136:58 - ok
137:03 - so here's the reason why I don't like
137:05 - using for each it's confusing it's
137:11 - confusing to beginners it's it uses a
137:16 - callback which is not even a concept in
137:19 - these videos that I've covered yet so if
137:21 - you're in this sequence oh I should do a
137:23 - video about for each and when you learn
137:25 - to use it but also the asynchronous
137:26 - aspect of the callback I think can be
137:29 - problematic and there's so many times
137:30 - we're having the counter is also just
137:32 - the index is incredibly useful so that's
137:35 - one of my reasons why I don't like using
137:36 - a for each alright so that was pretty
137:40 - good where was it 6 o'clock I think I'm
137:43 - gonna have to go this like desire to
137:45 - like but I'm not gonna say it I'll be
137:47 - it'll be if alright so we're so how did
137:51 - I how did I do there what did I get done
137:53 - I lost my playlist and if I go to my
138:01 - playlist here I told my dad yeah so
138:08 - weird whatever am I so I basically did
138:13 - this 7.3 this goes away so this year did
138:18 - gone
138:19 - there's no reason for this video to
138:22 - exist anymore in this playlist and then
138:24 - these can stay adding and removing
138:26 - objects and clicking on objects deleting
138:30 - objects using splice what's the
138:31 - difference between oh I made those two
138:33 - separate videos I think I've done this
138:35 - one oh I haven't done the I don't think
138:37 - do I do i I have to investigate this
138:39 - whether this actually I remove objects
138:41 - in this one but whatever's I'm in a
138:43 - slightly different sequence now because
138:45 - I did both push in this so what I need
138:50 - these can stay right now this should go
138:52 - away these can stay and the next things
138:55 - I need to do are clicking on an object
138:56 - and there's all of these deleting
139:02 - objects that sort of thing all right oh
139:06 - hi Sean Vann every Oh Sean man every so
139:09 - I forgot I opened I opened this live
139:13 - coding train episode with a sketch that
139:17 - Sean ban ever he made and this had
139:19 - crashed so let's try that again
139:24 - history oh how come it's not in this
139:32 - history show full history because it's I
139:35 - restarted the computer where wherever
139:42 - here we go here we go there we go all
139:47 - right Sean this is for you
139:58 - okay this is what the sponsored for not
140:02 - actually any money but this is this
140:04 - sponsored portion of my live video yes I
140:08 - that here's the thing I have no fear
140:10 - about showing my browser history because
140:13 - I'm logged in to a separate account that
140:17 - I only use for live streaming although I
140:19 - don't know who knows what I was doing
140:21 - earlier today in that account while I
140:22 - was setting up no that was not Sean Vann
140:25 - every at the door somebody else was at
140:27 - the door and I don't think anyone's
140:30 - guessed it yet
140:32 - okay so hello I'm here to tell you about
140:39 - something called
140:41 - interactive media arts which is a new
140:43 - BFA program at Tisch School of the Arts
140:45 - New York University right here in New
140:47 - York my name is Dan Shipman I am from
140:50 - the coding terrain YouTube channel but I
140:51 - also teach at a program called ITP
140:53 - which is a two-year graduate two-year
140:55 - graduate program master's program which
140:56 - still is here and it's still deep there
140:58 - and it's been around since 1979 so ver
141:01 - do the math I can't do that math but you
141:05 - can do it a long time and so next year
141:08 - we are starting a new undergraduate
141:10 - program and we're looking for students
141:12 - to apply if you are a high school senior
141:13 - junior I guess we can apply it whatever
141:15 - whatever you if you are the appropriate
141:17 - age to apply to college and are
141:20 - interested come and study here with us
141:22 - you can learn more at ITP NYU edu slash
141:26 - ima and you can there's all sorts of
141:31 - more information there and get your app
141:32 - there's stuff about how to apply and you
141:33 - can watch them Cody train videos to get
141:35 - a sense of what happens at ITP
141:37 - at ima and what will happen in ima it's
141:39 - gonna be great so please join us and
141:43 - tweet me at Schiffman if you if you need
141:45 - any if you have questions about or
141:46 - you're thinking about applying and we're
141:49 - seeing who will come here and and make
141:51 - the world a better place with code and
141:53 - other stuff to thank you
141:58 - how'd I do Sean Sean in the chat by the
142:01 - way is the director of undergraduate
142:03 - studies for the new I am a
142:05 - that's starting next year we have no
142:07 - idea if anyone will apply so I'm trying
142:12 - to do a little outreach we'd love for
142:14 - anybody from anywhere with any
142:16 - background who's interested in being
142:18 - creative maybe you are a maker or artist
142:21 - or you're a thinker engineer but this is
142:23 - really this is the button you should be
142:25 - because you should be defining yourself
142:27 - that sort of thing
142:30 - Gerald hunt says no one will acknowledge
142:32 - this comment but is there an upper age
142:39 - limit well I don't know that's a good
142:41 - question
142:42 - maybe Shawn in that chat can answer that
142:43 - question okay yeah me too Joseph okay
142:52 - you know by the way it's very bad
142:54 - practice when you're doing like a live
142:56 - stream to answer quote things that are
142:58 - in the chat without actually saying out
143:00 - repeating what they are but I just did
143:01 - it anyway and yeah you know so Austin
143:06 - writes and other people have writing the
143:08 - same things oh I wish I could go you
143:10 - know I can't afford it and this is a
143:11 - that is a really important and valid
143:16 - response and I hope that stuff that I'm
143:19 - doing here in this YouTube channel and
143:21 - other another innovative ways that
143:23 - people are thinking about to reduce the
143:25 - cost of Education I would love to be a
143:28 - part of that discussion and you know it
143:31 - is true that New York University being
143:33 - here this is a very expensive place and
143:35 - anything I could do to help make
143:37 - education accessible and more affordable
143:39 - for people I would love to do alright so
143:44 - I can't talk about the thing that I
143:48 - can't talk about because I was talking
143:50 - about it and then the whole thing
143:51 - crashed so right if you have a
143:57 - bachelor's degree already you should
143:58 - apply to ITP by the way if you're
144:00 - interested in hold on I did make some
144:06 - some videos that you might like if
144:08 - spring show ITP Schiffman coding train
144:12 - let's try this so that's the archive so
144:16 - this is a video that I made
144:18 - oh my god that's that music in it like
144:25 - [Music]
144:30 - I'm Dan this is a special coding
144:33 - training episode this what playing
144:36 - behind me spring show that's weird
144:42 - that's really weird so I won't play all
144:47 - this but you this is a video compilation
144:49 - that I made I don't know if you can hear
144:50 - me over this video show about a hundred
144:54 - I should do those like commentary like
144:57 - things where I like watch somebody
144:59 - else's video and I just like comment on
145:00 - it
145:00 - this video is terrible who's this idiot
145:06 - so this here like there's a bunch of
145:08 - projects that I show on different
145:09 - students and this is a graduate program
145:11 - and so and this is Michelle is amazing
145:14 - and so oh so you get you guys can you
145:19 - guys can watch this video it's online
145:20 - separate I'll link to it that you can
145:22 - learn a bit more about the kind of
145:23 - projects that people make it ITP by
145:25 - watching that video look there's also
145:28 - look at all these videos you could watch
145:29 - that are being recommended oh look at
145:33 - this what is ITP all right here we go
145:47 - dude I don't know
146:00 - this is so fancy what's he gonna stand
146:04 - for Oh program program program the video
146:10 - is too quiet still have no idea what
146:14 - they did here
146:15 - it's like humans plus technology or plus
146:18 - humans plus technology plus humans plus
146:23 - technology probably a lot of people
146:26 - still have that notion I have no idea
146:28 - what they do in there but it's something
146:29 - very quite a while ago I have a figure
146:31 - it's a problem it was a problem in that
146:33 - was a know something you know what he
146:35 - does oh so would you believe like things
146:37 - around the floor that I triple repeat oh
146:40 - it's that potage beans well I'm going to
146:44 - med school you know it's just it's hard
146:49 - to describe rob has 2006 gainfully tried
146:53 - to turn condensed to give us a I guess a
146:56 - mission statement all right at least a
146:58 - working description of the place which
147:01 - he thought I'm really enjoying them this
147:02 - has got to be at least ten years old
147:04 - we should insert that now
147:06 - [Music]
147:17 - we're trying to teach students that how
147:20 - to describe the program when they can
147:22 - describe the program to their parents
147:24 - they graduate ITP has definitely changed
147:28 - his personality over the years you guys
147:30 - recognize that voice dude Redbirds who
147:32 - I've talked about and I have Reds
147:33 - developing no this is a great video
147:46 - actually this is the origin actually I
147:55 - was fortunate with a colleague to get
147:58 - some money from the market foundation to
148:00 - start said about the college and the
148:01 - media center in 1971 and so when I was
148:06 - doing that that I realized there was no
148:07 - graduate department anywhere that
148:10 - provided this kind of opportunity for
148:12 - people to play with its tools and so in
148:16 - 1979 IP was started with 20 students it
148:22 - became apparent that the whole structure
148:24 - of communicating was radical
148:28 - there was again the spirit of pioneering
148:31 - and trying and you know they ran with it
148:34 - when I to be started in the nineteen the
148:37 - late 70s there were no computers and
148:39 - they were using closed caption video to
148:41 - do a lot of conferencing and stuff like
148:42 - that Twitty interesting stuff right
148:48 - video okay watching this I can watch
148:54 - this on my own time yeah
149:04 - okay
149:05 - and it became alright that's pretty
149:07 - interesting okay now where was I so I
149:12 - think I'm kind of wrapping up here I
149:14 - don't know if anybody has any I think
149:22 - I'm kind of done for today it is 610 to
149:24 - the Yankees game start what's the score
149:26 - the Yankees game and but but maybe I can
149:31 - answer a few questions or I don't think
149:37 - that I think I guess I could do one more
149:39 - of these they're short and I could get
149:40 - another one out of the way I could do
149:42 - the clicking maybe I should do the
149:46 - clicking so so Lubin's asked it so
149:55 - everyone's asking about the machine
149:56 - learning stuff again how to solve this
149:58 - problem but I'm gonna get to it I'm just
150:01 - I'm trying to doing some other stuff now
150:03 - I mean III talked about this earlier in
150:06 - the livestream so I'll come back to that
150:10 - yes sorry I'm not questions
150:20 - Annie's entertainment says where do I
150:22 - send you money send all of your checks
150:25 - to actually you should really donate to
150:27 - maybe a good cause like I saw that
150:30 - lin-manuel Miranda did is doing a
150:32 - fundraiser for Puerto Rico hurricane
150:34 - relief so that's where I would put my
150:36 - words right now today if I were you okay
150:43 - all right let me do one more because
150:46 - let's see what if I what have I actually
150:49 - gotten that will get published in the
150:50 - next week out today I did this tear I
150:53 - did this video where I tried to make a
150:54 - presentation about chatbots that I think
150:56 - maybe isn't any good I kind of did an
150:58 - introduction to rise script it was okay
151:00 - but not so great then I did a chatbot
151:02 - coding challenge which I thought turned
151:03 - out pretty well and then I I did this
151:08 - one so I've done four four things that
151:10 - it can get edited out of this and
151:12 - possibly a three or four depending on
151:14 - how many I choose to publish separately
151:17 - so so oh and I should really stop so
151:24 - Simon and I would like to do some kind
151:29 - of like marathon livestream at some
151:31 - point you know health was a concern of
151:33 - course I don't know that I could do
151:34 - something for 24 hours which Austin
151:36 - suggests plus the ima promo yeah yeah
151:40 - that's very sharp I just did it during
151:41 - the livestream I hope that was okay but
151:46 - and yes I do have a patreon that is
151:49 - correct so let's see let's no no
151:54 - clicking I should just go maybe I'll
151:57 - just go I'm gonna do the clicking I wish
151:59 - I had an idea for like you know how did
152:01 - the room well let's stop timeout
152:03 - I'm taking suggestions right now for
152:06 - anything similar to hi so I'm a harmonic
152:12 - motion again and I could really really
152:14 - make it super simple and just have
152:17 - something oscillating and I could make
152:19 - it color or size so what I'm looking for
152:22 - I'll take other suggestions but what I'm
152:24 - looking for I've been enjoying doing
152:27 - these so far these the 10 print and
152:30 - recursion this is nine minutes and this
152:33 - was twelve minutes they barely anything
152:35 - in the content of the video but the
152:37 - amount of creative things that people
152:39 - have created out of it has been really
152:41 - exciting to see so what's clicking the
152:44 - clicking the clicking was yeah so
152:47 - physics engine is no good that's too
152:49 - complicated
152:50 - Austin's telling me to set up I term
152:53 - make the ITP scrolling effect from the
152:56 - last video I don't know what that is
152:58 - harmonic motion is one recursion I
153:02 - already did
153:03 - game engine to complicated Hanoi towers
153:06 - to complicated anything the matter
153:08 - that's too complicated so so far I've
153:13 - got simple harmonic motion that's the
153:15 - only one that I've did I think and I
153:17 - term but point point box baking a pizza
153:24 - WebSockets to complicated
153:28 - if you click on the p5 homepage it makes
153:30 - a purple dot similar to the circle
153:32 - recursion do recursion and body
153:34 - simulation to calm the pac-man to
153:35 - complicated sine wave that I could do it
153:40 - could be a sine wave yeah let's do the
153:43 - sine wave Armand let's do the full I sis
153:48 - now that I have these array two toriel's
153:49 - kind of done let's do that okay here we
153:52 - go everybody Chrome extensions good one
153:55 - okay we're gonna do one more coding
153:58 - challenge then I'm gonna go home for the
154:00 - weekend cuz I can't bear to do another
154:02 - object-oriented programming video
154:05 - particle system I could do aa
154:07 - simple particle system look at that
154:10 - alright everybody
154:14 - last coding challenge we're gonna do a
154:17 - nice little poll simple particle system
154:21 - and when I say simple particle system I
154:24 - really mean Oh smoke like smoke effect
154:28 - okay and or us sine wave / simple
154:35 - harmonic motion and I should really just
154:37 - do both of these I'm just gonna do one
154:39 - okay
154:40 - here we go rb8 1d kak and now while I'm
154:52 - waiting for you to enter the straw poll
155:00 - [Music]
155:03 - 6240 to 3244 16,700
155:11 - oh that sound is so loud see this is the
155:38 - problem I don't have the laptop sorry
155:41 - everybody
155:41 - sorry 25 ok I've lost my energy okay
155:55 - that was your one minute to vote so I
155:59 - should really give you a little more
156:00 - time though because you guys are a
156:02 - little bit behind me so if I had three
156:11 - of these I could juggle them I bet
156:26 - nevermind ok poll is dead let's see here
156:30 - we go
156:50 - okay this is pretty clear oh I'm
156:53 - surprised nobody's watching is anybody
156:56 - watching these two loud again that's too
157:02 - loud I don't hold on I don't know what's
157:06 - going I should love to listen to I don't
157:07 - know I'm sorry the sound is all out of
157:08 - whack
157:13 - alright this even though only three my
157:17 - popularity is waning but it's pretty
157:25 - clear it's not too hot okay they're
157:29 - messing with you oh thank you
157:32 - it's fine I control you all so I could
157:41 - just do this for the next hour and never
157:44 - do the Cody challenge alright this is
158:03 - the last thing I'm going to do and okay
158:11 - so let's do this
158:16 - [Music]
158:31 - okay
158:46 - okay all right let's see here now
159:07 - and I'll get rid of this okay we're
159:16 - ready everybody I don't know how long
159:18 - I've been streaming for it's got to be
159:19 - like two and a half hours now I would
159:21 - guess so this is gonna be it for today
159:24 - I'm just gonna do I don't know why I'm
159:25 - doing one more thing it's really no
159:28 - reason for me to but I am I feel like
159:30 - guilty like I don't I'm not doing enough
159:32 - okay here we go oh wait this views hello
159:42 - welcome to another coding challenge in
159:45 - this coding challenge I'm gonna try to
159:46 - vary in a very simple way in a quick way
159:48 - program a simple particle system that
159:51 - resembles something like smoke so I'm
159:55 - gonna do this probably in a way that has
159:56 - very little visual interesting quality
159:58 - to it whatsoever it's my hope much like
160:00 - with my recent temperent and recursion
160:02 - coding challenges that I see a wide
160:05 - variety of clever beautiful remixes of
160:07 - this simple idea and what kind of
160:10 - beautiful particle system ideas can you
160:12 - make out of what I make so let me just
160:14 - start by making it so what I'm going to
160:15 - do the idea of the particle system by
160:17 - the way is creating something out of
160:20 - many particle things that's like the
160:23 - worst ever definition of a particle
160:27 - system but incidentally the term
160:29 - particle system was coined for
160:32 - originally for the movie the Wrath of
160:34 - Khan the effect the Genesis effect
160:37 - there's a effect where like this thing
160:39 - gets shot at a planet that doesn't have
160:40 - anything on it and kind of planet kind
160:42 - of catches fire and then all of a sudden
160:43 - it's all green and life is there and so
160:45 - anyway I think it's William T Reeves
160:47 - there's a paper I'll link to all that
160:49 - the history of particle systems in this
160:51 - video's description but but the idea is
160:54 - I want to make and I'm gonna do this as
160:56 - a class so I just recently started using
160:59 - es6 and I made a bunch of tutorials
161:01 - about classes and objects and I'm going
161:03 - to use that technique in this video so
161:06 - I'm gonna make a class anytime I make a
161:08 - class I need to make a constructor and
161:10 - this particle now I could use if you
161:12 - look at my nature of code videos I use
161:14 - this thing called a P vector that's in
161:16 - processing in p5 there's something
161:18 - called a p5 fector but
161:20 - stay simple here and I'm just going to
161:22 - make this X just an X a separate X which
161:27 - will be 300 and this dot Y which will be
161:29 - 3 380 so the reason why I'm doing this
161:34 - is I want my particles to in this idea
161:37 - you know I could do anything but I want
161:39 - them all to start at the bottom and kind
161:41 - of come up word and fade out which will
161:43 - hopefully give me a somewhat smoke or
161:46 - fire like effect it probably will not
161:48 - look like that at all but that you're
161:49 - gonna then you're gonna modify it make
161:51 - something much better okay so I want a
161:53 - function called show for each object and
161:56 - in it show I'm just gonna you know like
161:58 - loading images and using textures to
162:00 - draw the particles would be a nice
162:01 - technique to create more interesting
162:03 - visual effects but I'm just gonna draw
162:05 - them as circles this dot X this dot Y
162:08 - and I'm gonna give this I'm gonna have
162:09 - it be a diameter of 16 and I don't if
162:13 - the width and height are equal I can
162:14 - just use one I'm gonna say fill and I'm
162:16 - gonna give it some alpha and I'm gonna
162:18 - I'm gonna say stroke 255 just so I can
162:20 - see it really well now and so the Alpha
162:22 - will be like 10 so now let's just try
162:26 - making a single particle I'll just call
162:28 - it P P equals new particle and P dot
162:34 - show so let's run this there we go
162:40 - there's that particle now I does it a
162:42 - little bit so there's this is it I have
162:44 - one particle there it is at the bottom
162:46 - good so now what I want to do it's
162:49 - obvious I'm going to need many of them
162:50 - so I'm going to change this to be an
162:51 - array and what I'm actually going to do
162:54 - is I'm going to say in draw let P is
162:59 - equal a new particle and then I'm gonna
163:02 - say particles dot push P so what I'm
163:05 - going to do is I'm gonna use the push
163:07 - function which adds an object to the
163:09 - array and let me put this in setup now
163:11 - just for the sake of argument so I'm
163:12 - going to put one particle in the array
163:15 - so that now if I write a for loop that's
163:18 - in you know q2 complaining about not a
163:22 - for each loop where I iterate over the
163:25 - array using a counter variable like eye
163:27 - and say particles index where how do I
163:30 - get up there particles index I
163:33 - now I kind of have the same program this
163:36 - should be the same I should see just
163:37 - that one particle I created it and setup
163:40 - I added to the array and I'm showing it
163:42 - same exact program but now let's make
163:46 - that particle move
163:47 - so let's write a function called update
163:50 - let's give this particle variables like
163:54 - VX and V Y and I'm gonna give it an
163:58 - initial random like I'm gonna give it's
164:00 - random VX for velocity so I need a speed
164:03 - or way that it changes along the x-axis
164:05 - and a y-axis so using p5 vector could be
164:07 - helpful here and if anyone wants to do a
164:09 - port of this with p5 vector you're
164:11 - welcome to and then I'm gonna give it a
164:13 - random velocity going upward so what
164:16 - would that be upward is negative so
164:18 - something like between like negative 5
164:20 - and negative 1 so an update I'm now
164:24 - going to say this dot X plus equals this
164:27 - dot V X this dot y plus equals this dot
164:29 - dy so the idea here is that I'm going to
164:33 - change the location by some random
164:36 - amount and so I can now for all those
164:38 - particles I can say update you can think
164:44 - there it goes it goes up so I actually
164:47 - now I'm realizing a couple things here
164:48 - but what I want to do right is instead
164:51 - of just having one particle I mean when
164:53 - do I want to add particles do I want to
164:55 - start with a burst of them so I add 100
164:57 - and set up so I want to have them once
164:58 - every 5 seconds so I add some sort of
165:00 - timer there's so many different ways but
165:02 - let's try for the sake of argument just
165:05 - adding one new particle every time
165:07 - through draw so I'm getting somewhere
165:11 - this is kind of you know perhaps
165:13 - somewhat like the idea smoke doesn't
165:16 - really look like smoke but I've got a
165:17 - particle system here so things that I
165:19 - would want to do yeah and then way I
165:22 - could stop here and I could say hey you
165:23 - make this more creative and interesting
165:25 - but I'm missing some key features that I
165:28 - really need to have here so first of all
165:30 - one thing that I want to try doing is I
165:32 - want to give these particles a
165:34 - transparency so let's actually give them
165:37 - a variable called alpha and we'll start
165:38 - it at 255 and I'm going to use this
165:41 - variable here in its fill this alpha and
165:46 - an update I'm gonna say this dot alpha -
165:51 - equal one or - - or something so each
165:54 - one will fade out I don't know
165:56 - - equal five let's have them fade out
165:58 - pretty fast so it's gonna lose some
166:01 - alpha with each frame so you can see
166:04 - there this is gonna hopefully help me
166:06 - have something a bit more like smoke and
166:07 - the stroke is is there so I'm still
166:10 - seeing them all so what I want to do is
166:13 - let's actually take out the outline
166:16 - color we can see okay how did I do
166:22 - oh let's roast a marshmallow by the
166:26 - white circular fire delicious okay
166:31 - so actually in a way I'm kind of done
166:32 - but there's there's some more things I
166:35 - should really think about here number
166:36 - one is hmm after I run this for a while
166:40 - it's gonna start really being really
166:42 - really slow
166:43 - for example particles I could look in
166:46 - the console here particles dot length
166:47 - there's eight hundred thirty particles
166:49 - right now but I don't need eight hundred
166:52 - thirty particles right and if I look at
166:55 - it now there's a thousand fifty
166:56 - particles I'm adding new particles every
166:58 - frame but I'm never getting rid of them
167:00 - so I want to make sure that I remove
167:03 - particles so there's a different ways I
167:06 - could do this I think one way that I'm
167:08 - going to try to do this is I'm going to
167:09 - remove the particles when their alpha
167:12 - becomes less than zero so one way to do
167:16 - that is with the splice function and so
167:21 - if I come back to this main loop I could
167:24 - say if so one thing I might add I'm
167:26 - gonna say if particles index I is to
167:30 - delete iterative function that's kind of
167:32 - a weird name I want this function to
167:35 - delete - tell me true or false whether I
167:36 - should delete it it's like a question -
167:38 - delete delete finish maybe I'll just
167:41 - call it like finished then I want to
167:44 - remove this particle so let's write that
167:47 - function first so I'm gonna call this
167:50 - function finished and basically I'm just
167:54 - gonna return this dot alpha less than
167:58 - zero so it's a little bit weird
168:00 - I'm just writing return the results of
168:03 - this alpha less than zero so this not
168:05 - alpha is less than when it's less than
168:07 - zero this will evaluate to true or it
168:09 - will evaluate to false so this function
168:11 - is either going to return true or false
168:13 - and it's true when alpha when it's faded
168:15 - out I don't want to display it anymore
168:16 - so let's actually put that stroke back
168:19 - just so we can see it and then let me
168:24 - how do I remove a particle why could
168:27 - actually say particles dot splice I
168:29 - comma one so I happen to know this
168:31 - already but the splice function is a
168:33 - function that removes an element from
168:34 - the array at position I and just that
168:37 - one element so I could put it two there
168:40 - and remove that one and the one after it
168:41 - that's not what I want to do
168:57 - so now look at this you can see them
169:00 - getting removed now something weird is
169:02 - happening you see this like weird like
169:04 - flickery like thing so there's a little
169:06 - bit of an issue I've I've covered this
169:08 - in so many different videos I'm not sure
169:11 - if I should cover it here and just point
169:12 - to it but I'm gonna I think I will cover
169:14 - it here really briefly so I just
169:18 - realized you need to erase this
169:36 - so there's other ways around this and in
169:39 - many ways if I took out the stroke I
169:41 - wouldn't have this problem visually but
169:43 - what's happening here is if I have an
169:46 - array that has a bunch of spots in it
169:48 - and I call these like people a particle
169:50 - a particle B particle C particle D
169:54 - particle E and these are in spots 0 1 2
169:59 - 3 4 well what happens is if I'm
170:04 - iterating over this if I'm saying
170:06 - check spot zero should I delete it nope
170:09 - check spot 1 should I delete it nope
170:12 - check spot two should I delete it let's
170:16 - say yes I should delete it so I delete
170:18 - this one and now I have the array looks
170:20 - like this it has instead of having 1 2 3
170:23 - 4 5 it has 1 2 3 4 things in it PA PB P
170:29 - D and PE 0 1 2 3 so the next one I
170:36 - should check is number 3 right which is
170:38 - the last one notice what happened I was
170:40 - here
170:41 - so these shifted over and then I went to
170:43 - the next one which actually I ended up
170:45 - skipping PD so so this could be a
170:48 - problem and a way that I could deal this
170:50 - is just go backwards because I'm going
170:52 - backwards I check this when I check this
170:53 - one then I check this one if I remove it
170:55 - these shift over it doesn't matter I'm
170:56 - not affecting the beginning of the array
170:57 - and in some ways this is less of an of
171:01 - an important issue right here but it is
171:03 - this is the thing you need to be
171:04 - thinking about if you're using a counter
171:06 - and iterating over the right like if
171:07 - ideally we're on adding stuff to the
171:09 - array that's also really good be a
171:10 - problem never get to the end and I'll be
171:12 - stuck in an infinite loop so here's a
171:14 - way around that I'm gonna start at the
171:16 - end of the array particles length minus
171:18 - 1 then I'm going to say greater than I'm
171:22 - gonna go down to 0 and say I minus minus
171:24 - just gonna go in the array backwards and
171:27 - now you can see was the stuff fades out
171:30 - it disappears there's no more weird
171:31 - flickering there's a little weird that
171:33 - they just disappear suddenly but this is
171:35 - mostly just because of the fact that
171:38 - they have this stroke on them now I'm
171:41 - only removing them when I can't see them
171:43 - so now if I look at
171:45 - particles dot length is only 51
171:50 - particles and I run this for another a
171:51 - few seconds while I'm talking and
171:52 - there's still only 51 and there's still
171:54 - only 51 so the timing is working out
171:56 - such that there's only ever going to be
171:57 - 51 so how could I make this look more
172:00 - like smoke well one thing that might be
172:03 - important to play with is how many
172:05 - particles do I want to add each frame so
172:12 - this is now five particles per frame
172:14 - whoops and oh sorry this needs to be
172:19 - inside the loop so you can see here you
172:23 - know does this look more like smoke left
172:25 - like smoke but so that's one parameter
172:28 - here that's important to work on but
172:30 - here is really what I think is important
172:32 - number one is oh I didn't even add any
172:34 - acceleration so like adding some type of
172:37 - acceleration so I'm not going to do this
172:39 - in this video but this is what you want
172:41 - to think about what's a different way
172:43 - that you could pick initial velocities
172:44 - should those velocities change over time
172:47 - what are you actually are using color
172:48 - what shape are you drawing do the size
172:51 - of those circles vary are you can you
172:54 - make it feel like something that's not
172:56 - smoke or fire but more like a confetti
172:58 - bursts or something fireworks I have
173:00 - another coding challenge where I do
173:01 - fireworks which is pretty similar to so
173:03 - there's a lot of possible things you
173:05 - could do and so I'm gonna end this here
173:07 - with this code and I look forward to a
173:10 - thousand particle flower systems
173:12 - blooming please share them with me
173:16 - hashtag on Twitter particle train
173:19 - particle trade particle train particle
173:22 - train no what's that song particle it's
173:25 - particle man's that they might be done
173:26 - the particle train is good
173:27 - so hashtag particle train on Twitter I
173:31 - would love to see love gifts and
173:32 - animations of all your particle systems
173:33 - that you make share your code and I look
173:36 - forward to seeing you in my next coding
173:38 - challenge alright everybody I think this
173:48 - is the end so I don't know how did I do
173:52 - I did an extra thing it is now 6:35
173:57 - and it's time for me to go I will
174:00 - happily answer a few last questions I'm
174:08 - looking at my phone I'm getting updates
174:11 - about the Yankees game I need to show
174:19 - the eye - what - equals one in the
174:21 - for-loop oh oh yeah I could also so this
174:24 - is a good point another strategy thank
174:27 - you for this another strategy I could do
174:29 - is just like as I'm going through the
174:31 - loop and things shift over I could just
174:33 - set I back and like no and say I minus
174:36 - one so I could have done that that's a
174:38 - very good thing did the sound oh you
174:43 - guys are okay alright everybody thank
174:49 - you to everyone I appreciate all of your
174:52 - comments even when you're asking when
174:53 - I'm gonna do the Agha Rio part 3 or a
174:55 - machine-learning school the Chrome
174:57 - extensions is the one I really could get
174:59 - to and I term those are all those things
175:00 - I'm coming they're coming
175:02 - there's only I if I could do this every
175:03 - day think about how many things they
175:05 - could get through except I have to there
175:07 - are certain things as you know as with
175:09 - the chat BOTS that I have to kind of
175:10 - research and practice a little bit I
175:12 - think it makes the tutorials a little
175:14 - bit better to be honest and certain
175:15 - things I could kind of do off-the-cuff
175:16 - like like this particular one so goodbye
175:21 - song people like this alright alright so
175:24 - this is going to go for two and a half
175:26 - minutes and I'm gonna just sort of read
175:27 - the chat and see if I can answer any
175:30 - questions
175:31 - plans for the next livestream so next
175:34 - Friday I'm hoping to continue the chat
175:36 - bots stuff to do the p5 speech thing and
175:39 - maybe an Alexa skill as well as more
175:41 - object and Ray videos get those done
175:44 - Yeah right it could pop removes the
175:51 - object from the array but can we push at
175:53 - the end yes
175:55 - Lorenz and is asking which is the
175:57 - firework one if somebody could help out
175:59 - and post a link to the fireworks coding
176:01 - challenge in the chat that would be
176:03 - great it's the couldn't challenge number
176:04 - something to just go to the coding
176:06 - challenge playlist there's 70 some of
176:08 - them now you'll find it yeah before I do
176:12 - the Alexis skill I want to have the
176:14 - Alexa in here working and it doesn't
176:17 - work on the NYU wireless unless I
176:19 - authenticate it in some way so when are
176:22 - these videos going to be released so
176:24 - what happens is you have more gaming
176:26 - challenges I know people are interested
176:28 - in that working on these videos so what
176:32 - happens is after today Matt at math
176:36 - blank on Twitter helps edit them and
176:39 - release them as separate videos this
176:41 - live stream will stay archived forever
176:43 - you know it's available immediately
176:44 - after this end it goes to unlisted so
176:47 - you might have to be clever to find the
176:49 - link or ask me for it but it'll be
176:51 - probably made public tomorrow or the
176:52 - next day and the videos will come out I
176:54 - can't try to release one new video per
176:56 - day I don't know in theory like
176:57 - spreading them out is better than
176:59 - replacing them all at once API is
177:03 - definitely something I would love to
177:04 - look at papa bane I would love to keep
177:08 - track look at your particle system yes
177:11 - can you allow links to your own videos I
177:14 - have to add dot because of the spam
177:16 - filter oh yeah I don't know if someone
177:20 - tells me how to do that I'm happy to do
177:21 - that right now it has to be someone who
177:23 - has moderator privileges
177:27 - great so Topher I mean I cover it not
177:30 - you know there's a lot to making Alexis
177:32 - kill button if we need to go over the
177:33 - basics is p5 shader support on the way
177:38 - there was a lot of work I really need to
177:41 - do a video exploring WebGL again
177:42 - somebody helped me remember that but
177:44 - there's been a lot of work over the
177:45 - summer that I mentioned by Stahl Jia and
177:48 - Kate and
177:49 - apologize for missing their full names
177:50 - or the Twitter handles but did google
177:52 - Summer of Code about WebGL mp5 and I
177:55 - think probably someone needs to
177:56 - volunteer to really help work on that
177:58 - shader support there is some of the
177:59 - progress worked I don't know where this
178:02 - [Music]
178:03 - Alexa skill Alexa is the Amazon echo
178:06 - product where you can create a your own
178:09 - chat bot you can release on Alexa for
178:11 - people to interact with okay thank you
178:16 - anybody uh one last question I wonder if
178:19 - your pupil students watch your streams I
178:21 - really hope not I mean I have fun doing
178:25 - this and I'm glad that people appreciate
178:26 - it but sometimes I worry about it okay
178:30 - anyway so thank you everybody I will see
178:32 - you next Friday for another coding train
178:36 - episode and enjoy your weekend and your
178:41 - week and take some time away from your
178:43 - code do something nice for somebody and
178:46 - all that stuff okay thank you dolly for
178:49 - posting Kate Holland back as her last
178:50 - name installed gia also has a last name
178:53 - two students who did google Summer of
178:55 - Code you can check out in processing org
178:56 - medium ok pac-man pac-man probably needs
179:00 - multiple parts it's a longer project I'm
179:02 - gonna have to dedicate a whole session
179:04 - for that probably alright goodbye
179:06 - everybody it's a different time rembu
179:09 - sighs it's a different time every week
179:10 - you check Friday morning Easter time I
179:12 - usually set the time it's usually
179:14 - mid-afternoon but I like doing in the
179:15 - morning if I can alright good bye
179:18 - everybody
179:19 - have a good rest of your time okay stop
179:24 - straight
