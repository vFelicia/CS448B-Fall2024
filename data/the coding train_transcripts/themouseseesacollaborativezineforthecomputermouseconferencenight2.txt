00:54 - hello everyone just doing a quick mic
00:56 - check although i'm only going to be
00:58 - speaking for the first few minutes so my
01:00 - mic really doesn't matter but let me
01:02 - know in the chat if you hear me okay
01:35 - do
02:06 - all right welcome everyone i sorry that
02:08 - music is going to stop very abruptly
02:11 - there because i don't have a nice fade
02:13 - transition but welcome to night two of
02:16 - the
02:16 - uh
02:17 - mouse sees the collaborative zine for
02:19 - the computer mouse conference simulcast
02:22 - along with the computer mouse conference
02:23 - i've got over here in my monitor the
02:27 - mouse conference stream and i don't
02:28 - believe it started yet which is good
02:30 - because as soon as it does start i'm
02:32 - going to switch over and you'll if
02:33 - you're watching this collaborative scene
02:35 - you will get to hear all the audio from
02:37 - the actual conference
02:39 - maybe you're wondering what is the
02:40 - computer mouse conference and what is
02:42 - going on here
02:44 - so um i
02:46 - um
02:48 - i am going to tell you about all of that
02:50 - sorry i'm like pulling up the page that
02:51 - i have information about it okay so the
02:54 - conference the music computer mouse
02:55 - conference is organized by um emma um
02:58 - and ashley this is the second night of
03:00 - it there are a wonderful set of panels
03:03 - and talks and all sorts of things
03:04 - happening i posted the link in the ch in
03:07 - the chat um which is at uh
03:12 - complicatingthecomputermouse.net let me
03:13 - post that again
03:16 - sorry i'm a little bit it's been a long
03:18 - day how's everybody doing
03:20 - what this stream is is it is one of the
03:23 - most incredible things i've ever had the
03:25 - chance to witness which i got to see the
03:27 - first night of it um this is a
03:29 - essentially like a live performance in a
03:30 - way but of the mouse sees so this is
03:33 - live documentation in the form of a
03:35 - collaborative zine for the conference
03:38 - and it's organized by neto bomani so as
03:41 - the conference is happening in real time
03:43 - neda is listening and printing and
03:45 - cutting and just beautifully curating
03:48 - this physical paper zine um i it's it's
03:51 - really inadequate for me to try to
03:53 - describe it in words you really just
03:54 - have to experience it
03:56 - people are sharing lots of images from
03:57 - it on twitter that you can find and you
04:00 - can also check the stream from last
04:01 - night to see images of it um let me tell
04:03 - you a little bit so um by the way you
04:06 - are welcome to participate in the making
04:08 - of this scene if you go to the twitter
04:10 - account the mouse sees i'm gonna i'll
04:12 - put this in the chat at the mouse seas
04:16 - um you can tweet at the mouse c's with
04:19 - um the answer to the question what does
04:21 - the now see or any other thoughts or
04:23 - reactions you have images you have both
04:25 - neda and i are tracking our mouse
04:27 - movements and those and
04:29 - little visualizations of those mouse
04:30 - movements will be tweeted automatically
04:32 - from that account
04:34 - um neda is an abolitionist who is
04:36 - interested in parsing information in
04:37 - histories while making things by hand
04:39 - together with human and non-human
04:41 - computers
04:43 - you can find neda on her website on
04:45 - twitter arena and instagram all of those
04:47 - links are in this video's description
04:49 - i'm just gonna sit here and copy paste
04:51 - them right into the chat so you have
04:53 - them as well so i please encourage you
04:55 - to learn more about neda and her work um
04:58 - i also want to mention that you should
04:59 - join neta the computer mouse conference
05:01 - and the coding train in supporting
05:03 - survived and punished new york's spring
05:06 - mutual 8 group mutual aid group
05:08 - fundraiser so i'm going to paste a link
05:10 - to that it's in the pinned comment i'm
05:12 - going to paste a link to that in the um
05:15 - chat here so survived and punished is a
05:17 - grassroots prison abolitionist
05:19 - organization an allied media project
05:22 - that um that exists to end the
05:24 - criminalization of survivors of domestic
05:26 - and sexual violence so we are raising
05:28 - money to provide commissary packages and
05:30 - other material support for criminalized
05:32 - survivors please donate as we continue
05:35 - and we being survived and punished
05:36 - continue to expand our giving to more
05:38 - survivors and provide care to our
05:40 - communities all donations are tax
05:42 - deductible that's for us to the fullest
05:44 - extent of the law so i want to just say
05:46 - a huge wonderful thank you and and
05:49 - excited
05:50 - happy moment to say that uh survived and
05:52 - punished reached um their goal of a
05:54 - hundred thousand dollars i think to the
05:56 - generosity hopefully of some of the from
05:58 - some of the viewers from last night um
06:00 - and everyone from i see that mass
06:01 - conference started so i gotta wrap this
06:03 - up um um uh from um from the uh people
06:07 - who donated last night the links on the
06:09 - uh com from the conference website um
06:11 - but i just want to encourage you to
06:12 - continue to donate so any extra money
06:14 - raised beyond the goal will go to
06:16 - support the same work so if you were
06:17 - just about to make a donation and you
06:19 - were sad that the goal was already
06:21 - reached um please still do um and um
06:24 - coding train is um making a donation um
06:27 - as part of this um live stream as well
06:29 - and as soon as i stop talking i'm gonna
06:30 - go and do that right now and i hope that
06:32 - you will consider matching that donation
06:34 - okay i gotta switch to the conference
06:35 - audio and to neta's desktop that's what
06:38 - you'll be hearing i'll be in the chat um
06:40 - all night you have questions ask in the
06:42 - live chat um you can go back and forth
06:43 - between the two feeds or keep them both
06:45 - on and um thank you so much to everyone
06:54 - in lots of talks yesterday this theme of
06:57 - trying to unpack
06:58 - the
06:59 - really problematic past of technology in
07:01 - this way shows up time and time again
07:03 - and is as i would say even more
07:05 - referenced today um in talks like
07:07 - dorothy's and all and ryan's as well
07:09 - definitely
07:11 - we have a couple of reminders for you so
07:14 - yesterday we had the
07:17 - i just want to say like the joy of
07:19 - watching neta bomani create the
07:22 - live scene in the stream and the live
07:24 - scene is linked in the website that
07:26 - you're watching this on so just below
07:28 - our video you can find the link to neto
07:30 - bomani's
07:31 - live scene and dan schiffman made an
07:34 - incredible bot that lets you contribute
07:36 - to the zine so if you tweet at the mouse
07:39 - sees then you can send neta screenshots
07:43 - or texts or
07:45 - images or links to videos you know the
07:47 - list goes on and on and neto will fold
07:50 - that into the creative practice of
07:52 - creating the zine which will be really
07:53 - really cool yes and um additionally i
07:57 - think if you're watching right now you
07:58 - should see a chat room on the right yeah
08:02 - some people i know yesterday had issues
08:04 - with this so
08:05 - i think one of the tricks is to refresh
08:08 - your browser
08:10 - and it might take just a second for the
08:11 - chat to show up but it should if it
08:13 - doesn't i'm so sorry it's technical
08:14 - error it's something we have to just
08:16 - deal with
08:17 - um but it looks like a lot of you are in
08:18 - there already there's a lot of ascii art
08:20 - uh we're thankful for that um and before
08:24 - you join the chat
08:25 - please
08:27 - click on the link for the code of
08:28 - conduct
08:30 - before participating so that we can make
08:32 - sure that we are participating in a way
08:35 - that is meaningful and engaging with
08:37 - each other
08:39 - that is linked right below the stream
08:41 - yeah
08:43 - and we've got some thank yous right
08:45 - yesterday was so spectacular and it
08:47 - really would not even be one percent
08:50 - possible without all of the tech support
08:52 - that culturehub has given us sangmin who
08:55 - is just over here
08:56 - again like just doing doing the hard
08:59 - work today of switching between
09:01 - streams and just such an incredible
09:03 - human being
09:04 - sangmin is a culture hub creative
09:06 - technologist
09:07 - and we really just like cannot thank you
09:09 - enough
09:10 - deandra as well deandra anthony
09:13 - another wonderful
09:15 - staff member at culture hub and deandra
09:18 - is the lead technician and we've worked
09:20 - so closely with d'andra getting
09:22 - everything set up and
09:23 - she's with us remotely
09:25 - but like in our hearts as well
09:28 - making sure that everything runs
09:29 - smoothly so we're just really grateful
09:30 - for culture hub as well as the media
09:33 - archaeology lab and the processing
09:35 - foundation and the coding train for all
09:37 - of their incredible support and helping
09:39 - us stream the live scene and be able to
09:41 - pay speakers as well
09:42 - yes
09:44 - um and that they're all linked below as
09:46 - well so take time to check out um their
09:49 - websites when you can
09:51 - um so we just got out of ed's
09:54 - workshop yeah um
09:56 - and
09:57 - ed bear is
09:59 - uh an amazing
10:01 - teacher an amazing
10:04 - artist and
10:06 - technologist and musician
10:08 - and there's something he said during the
10:09 - workshop
10:11 - that
10:13 - i'm still holding on to he said that
10:15 - there is a global infrastructure inside
10:18 - the body of the mouse
10:20 - and
10:21 - this is true
10:24 - yeah
10:25 - and it's something that i
10:27 - i wish that in my own in our own um
10:31 - you know tech educational experience
10:33 - that that was something that was kind of
10:35 - given to us when we were learning about
10:37 - um
10:38 - physical computing and technical objects
10:40 - to kind of engage
10:42 - with this kind of
10:44 - terrible fact that there's a whole
10:46 - global infrastructure baked into a
10:49 - microchip right
10:51 - yeah and emma and i were just chatting
10:53 - before the stream and just talking about
10:55 - how
10:56 - when it's framed that way
10:58 - how just frankly unacceptable it is that
11:01 - we don't have the perception of just how
11:04 - incredibly enormous the
11:07 - impact is of creating these pieces of
11:08 - technology like i'm holding my hand out
11:10 - like this because i'm imagining a mouse
11:12 - and uh
11:14 - and i think that like right exactly put
11:16 - our mice together and i think that the
11:18 - uh the
11:20 - the idea that we don't have that
11:22 - perception even though it's underneath
11:25 - the shell of what
11:27 - forms the exterior of lots of our
11:29 - technology is is just really when it's
11:31 - framed like ed bear has framed it it's
11:33 - really appalling um because when you
11:35 - open up the technology if we had learned
11:37 - about physical computing through the act
11:39 - of a tear down that framed it in that
11:41 - context you would see circuit boards
11:43 - that were stamped like printed in india
11:45 - you would see like elements of our of
11:47 - our components that you would have to
11:48 - unscrew and peel the glue back of right
11:51 - pieces that were toxic that you wouldn't
11:52 - be able to touch it's really
11:55 - as it's very unglamorous it's very
11:57 - unglamorous and it's a very visceral
11:59 - experience yeah to kind of get into a
12:01 - chip um and to kind of be met with
12:05 - the complexity of that chip and like the
12:07 - impossibility of
12:09 - hacking that chip and using it for your
12:11 - own means
12:12 - and
12:13 - another thing we were talking about
12:14 - earlier is like uh just also the ease
12:17 - with which uh which with which we
12:20 - learned physical computing and the ease
12:21 - with which you could just buy new
12:22 - components yeah um and not reuse
12:26 - components there's like a
12:28 - yeah
12:29 - yeah
12:30 - because you
12:32 - so we've emma and i have both done like
12:34 - a bunch of school
12:35 - several degrees in technology
12:38 - when you learn about physical computing
12:39 - or even upgrade your skills there is a
12:41 - glamour to it you do unbox really shiny
12:43 - parts that have like
12:45 - very famous names you know uh like i'm
12:47 - thinking of a very particular blue
12:49 - circuit board right now and that those
12:51 - boxed they have great branding they come
12:53 - with stickers like there's a glamour
12:54 - that feels like you're joining a club
12:56 - you know and i think that the
12:58 - it really
12:59 - it really continues to divorce you from
13:01 - the
13:02 - like possible just the possible and and
13:05 - in fact like actual destruction of a lot
13:07 - of this technology because you start to
13:09 - feel that kind of energy that cesar was
13:11 - talking about in his talk yesterday when
13:13 - you open up your computer and you're met
13:15 - with that like windows 95 sound and that
13:17 - beautiful glamorous desktop background
13:19 - and you start to feel energized and sort
13:21 - of like empowered by all of that which
13:23 - continues to divorce you from the
13:25 - from the uh
13:26 - from the way in which you might feel
13:27 - connected to the destruction
13:30 - totally and uh this is a very very good
13:33 - segue into our first screening tonight
13:36 - um did we covered everything yeah yeah
13:38 - yeah so our next screening um
13:41 - is a video by ryan clark
13:46 - it's titled nature's notifications
13:50 - uh and after the screening we will be
13:52 - doing a q a with ryan we're very excited
13:54 - live live yes this is live this is the
13:57 - first
13:58 - non-host live conversation we've had so
14:01 - brian's gonna just so save your
14:02 - questions yes he'll be here yeah
14:05 - okay so we'll go to that video now and
14:07 - we'll see you uh in a little bit
14:09 - awesome
14:17 - [Applause]
14:21 - [Laughter]
14:31 - foreign

15:02 - [Laughter]
15:13 - now
15:21 - [Music]
15:34 - [Music]
15:38 - somebody
15:47 - [Music]
16:01 - [Music]
16:11 - [Music]
16:16 - uh
16:24 - [Music]
16:42 - to persuade females to come close and
16:44 - admire his plumes he sings the most
16:46 - complex song he can manage and he does
16:48 - that by copying the songs of all the
16:51 - other birds he has around him such as
16:53 - the kookaburra
16:59 - he also in his attempt to out sing his
17:02 - rivals incorporates other sounds that he
17:04 - hears in the forest
17:08 - that was a camera shutter
17:10 - and again
17:15 - and now a camera with a motor drive
17:35 - and now the sounds of foresters and
17:37 - their chainsaws working nearby
17:40 - [Applause]
17:48 - [ __ ]
18:10 - uh
18:14 - jesus
18:31 - [Music]
18:33 - so

19:46 - [Music]
20:04 - oh
20:18 - [Music]

21:28 - oh oh
21:44 - [Music]
22:16 - [Music]
22:19 - so
22:22 - [Music]
22:56 - [Music]
23:06 - [Music]
23:42 - all right we're back uh and we're back
23:45 - with ryan and it i really
23:49 - i really feel like this deserves an
23:50 - incredible round of applause and you'll
23:52 - find out a little bit more why even
23:53 - further so
23:55 - um but we're here with ryan uh uh we're
23:58 - so excited to be live having this
24:00 - conversation because emma and i spent
24:02 - all day yesterday just talking to each
24:03 - other so now we get to talk to you as
24:05 - well
24:06 - um so i'm gonna read ryan's bio and
24:09 - uh emma and i already decided that this
24:11 - is perhaps the coolest bio we've ever
24:13 - come across
24:14 - so it reads a selective chronologist r.c
24:18 - clarke notices the passage of time
24:20 - through both an
24:21 - ethnomusicological lens as a co-editor
24:24 - at dweller electronics and
24:26 - oceanographically as a phd student in
24:30 - coastal geological
24:32 - sciences in new orleans louisiana
24:35 - um so welcome ryan thank you so much uh
24:38 - should we reveal what
24:40 - what we learned while we were watching
24:42 - this together yes but before we do that
24:44 - i just want to say that someone said in
24:45 - the chat oh wow did not expect to cry at
24:48 - the computer mouse conference day too
24:50 - and i just want to say that i also cried
24:52 - when i watched this video so did i um
24:54 - but i cried without
24:57 - there being captions we just found out
24:59 - that there were supposed to be captions
25:01 - so
25:02 - ryan's gonna send us another video with
25:05 - captions that we can watch again yeah
25:07 - we'll post the um the non-ambient
25:10 - version
25:11 - of nature's notifications but i'm glad
25:13 - it worked um and evoked something uh for
25:17 - everyone watching so thank you and it
25:18 - wasn't just emma and i and this
25:20 - commenter in the chat we have been
25:21 - talking about this video for days and it
25:24 - made people at culture hub as we were
25:26 - recording it recording sessions and
25:27 - talking about sessions cry we have like
25:29 - friends and family who we've like you
25:31 - know let take a peek who have also been
25:33 - really moved by it so
25:35 - i can only imagine how wrecked we'll be
25:37 - in the
25:41 - oh captions
25:43 - i want to so i just wanted to i i after
25:45 - reading your bio after watching uh the
25:47 - video many times i'm wondering like
25:50 - given that your practice and your um
25:54 - [Music]
25:55 - research through geology through
25:57 - ethnomusicology
26:00 - given that you practice both of these
26:01 - things i'm wondering like how you define
26:05 - the word chronology or how you define
26:07 - chronology and because i was thinking
26:09 - that um and because your video is like i
26:12 - don't know so much about time i think um
26:15 - uh like my definition of chronology like
26:18 - i've been taught that order is like
26:20 - beginning to end like on a linear
26:22 - timeline or something
26:23 - so i just wonder how you think about
26:25 - chronology in your practice or in this
26:27 - video um
26:29 - yeah um
26:31 - i guess
26:32 - i think of it
26:33 - through the lens of the observer so it
26:35 - has a lot to do with the observer effect
26:38 - where how time can go
26:40 - or how time moves
26:43 - whether someone's actually watching or
26:45 - noting that passage of time
26:47 - can alter so it can like speed up or
26:49 - slow down
26:51 - and considering humans i guess in
26:53 - relation to like deep time so again like
26:56 - as a geologist you know like 4.3 billion
26:58 - years on the earth and then
27:00 - 13.4 billion
27:02 - for the universe you know we're here for
27:04 - such a small portion of that
27:07 - and in doing so
27:09 - um
27:10 - i don't know i guess i guess you start
27:12 - to
27:13 - whether subconsciously or not start to
27:15 - view things a little bit differently
27:17 - and
27:19 - when when you see sort of a a loss
27:22 - of of a time or a climate um
27:28 - it it's you can see that this moment has
27:30 - shown itself up
27:31 - uh before
27:33 - so to speak more literally like the
27:35 - pleistocene like three million years ago
27:37 - uh the sea level was like you know uh
27:40 - pretty much the same levels but
27:42 - uh
27:43 - the difference is like carbon dioxide in
27:45 - the atmosphere was like much different
27:47 - so that's us right that's anther that's
27:50 - uh that's anthropogenic change and so
27:53 - understanding time you start to see like
27:55 - the small little differences and i guess
27:57 - i'm interested in what can cause those
27:59 - differences and
28:02 - bringing attention to them because
28:04 - i do think that we have the
28:06 - capability to change
28:08 - change that
28:10 - right and i guess that also
28:13 - it's a it's a really interesting
28:14 - definition of time as well because it
28:16 - also references scale in a way that's
28:19 - different than the way that i imagine
28:21 - time in a very conventional sense right
28:23 - that doesn't like my reference of time
28:25 - the scale is like hour to millisecond
28:28 - that's as far as scale gets but this
28:29 - definition requires so much more
28:31 - observation of of of scale in in a in a
28:34 - way that's really exciting to learn
28:36 - about
28:38 - for sure for sure there's some
28:41 - there's this writer called gabrielle
28:43 - hecht
28:44 - where she talks about uh
28:46 - inter intrascalar vehicles
28:49 - and it's like okay well what sort of um
28:52 - examples or mindsets or concepts can we
28:55 - start to implement to like think larger
28:58 - right in terms of scale and
29:01 - i think going into geology if there's
29:03 - one thing that has been benefited me is
29:05 - it that topic alone is an inter-scalar
29:08 - vehicle
29:09 - and in watching or making and editing
29:12 - these videos uh
29:14 - yeah i was just trying to produce
29:15 - another kind of interscalar vehicle so
29:18 - we can kind of not remove ourselves but
29:20 - you know
29:21 - see what kind of agency that we either
29:23 - have or don't have
29:24 - and
29:25 - maybe the the text for the the caption
29:28 - version might you know poke a bit more
29:31 - at that um right but you know i think
29:34 - the emotion gets across
29:36 - uh without the captions yeah oh my gosh
29:38 - the motion really gets across definitely
29:40 - i mean i think it it i
29:42 - the inter-scalar vehicle um i remember
29:45 - reading maybe it's an essay i don't know
29:47 - if it's an essay or yeah yeah i remember
29:50 - reading that and yeah it did really do
29:51 - that it did carry me through like i i
29:55 - really felt i think that's why it's so
29:57 - um
29:59 - emotional because it goes in and out and
30:01 - there's like you can really feel a
30:02 - dissonance you can really
30:04 - feel that kind of uncomfortable
30:06 - dissonance and then that last animation
30:08 - i feel kind of just like draws it all
30:10 - out like draws all the kind of tension
30:12 - out that is held
30:14 - in going in between
30:16 - um
30:17 - yeah we were talking about that
30:18 - dissonance a lot yeah we've been talking
30:20 - about the like
30:22 - video and how it
30:25 - holds this really uncomfortable
30:26 - dissonance because it's peppered with
30:29 - sounds that we have
30:31 - just burned into our memory uh
30:34 - that are really tied to nostalgia
30:36 - and then also shows us images and videos
30:39 - of things we don't see that often unless
30:41 - we seek it out but we subconsciously
30:44 - know are happening and i think we're not
30:46 - often brought to the confrontational
30:49 - moment where we have to see those two
30:50 - things the like tech we have like
30:52 - heartfelt feelings for and the
30:56 - questionable heartfelt feelings for and
30:57 - the destruction that is
31:00 - you know manifesting as a result of that
31:01 - tech we don't we don't have many
31:03 - instances of being like brought to the
31:04 - confrontation of the interlinking of
31:06 - those two things um so there's a lot of
31:09 - dissonance in the video because of that
31:10 - it's uncomfortable
31:12 - absol absolutely and yeah i mean i i'm i
31:16 - will say i definitely have nostalgia
31:17 - like that windows 95 theme i i run back
31:20 - to my mom's you know uh media room
31:23 - with you know fairy wooden you know lots
31:25 - of little diskette shelves and all of
31:27 - that
31:28 - and also like he's like you know being a
31:30 - sucker for micro composition like um in
31:34 - the beginning of that it talks about how
31:35 - brian you know was prompted by microsoft
31:38 - in
31:38 - in i think 94 um to produce
31:41 - a
31:42 - a
31:44 - a very like small amount of sound but
31:47 - evokes
31:48 - optimism
31:49 - uh connection
31:51 - you know all these different things they
31:52 - threw these words at him and one i think
31:54 - he landed on it perfectly but it what it
31:57 - also did is that it sort of um
32:00 - it encapsulates this idea of like this
32:02 - uh
32:02 - blind optimism of the 90s of like that
32:04 - kind of tech boom
32:06 - and uh there's a lag of that feeling
32:08 - that optimism which you still hear in
32:10 - like these ios sounds that i had pepper
32:12 - in um but obviously
32:15 - the world no longer reflects this sort
32:17 - of optimism so it it starts with like
32:19 - again co2 like talking about how co2 uh
32:22 - atmospheric levels are like rising and
32:24 - tipping points for a climate um
32:27 - but are these sounds reflecting
32:29 - uh you know nature uh kind of
32:32 - getting larger and more frequent uh such
32:35 - as like hurricanes and things like that
32:37 - um
32:38 - i would say no uh that's the dissonance
32:41 - that uh is there but um i think it
32:45 - it was definitely a meditation to
32:46 - investigate that for my own sake because
32:48 - yeah i love all these sounds um
32:50 - especially those windows 95 ones there's
32:52 - a special place in my heart for
32:54 - for all those guys
32:56 - yeah
32:57 - wow
32:58 - i mean
33:00 - it's it's both like so
33:02 - manipulative
33:03 - as like a design for sound and it's so
33:05 - manipulative but it's not unlike so many
33:08 - other kinds of like methods of
33:10 - of sensory
33:11 - experiences that are like forcing us to
33:13 - feel a particular kind of way it's just
33:15 - unfortunate that like we're being forced
33:16 - to feel a particular kind of way about
33:18 - such a
33:19 - sure yeah like a particular kind of
33:22 - destructive property
33:24 - yeah what was it
33:26 - like we were wondering about what it's
33:27 - like to make the video right yeah we
33:29 - were wondering a little bit just about
33:30 - the process i mean it was cool to hear
33:32 - that you were thinking about gabriel
33:34 - heck's intrascalar vehicle but maybe if
33:36 - there's any uh
33:38 - i don't know other other ways of making
33:40 - this video um in terms of
33:43 - i don't know how you approach your
33:45 - research maybe or how you even just like
33:47 - sound like
33:49 - music and sound like how that played
33:52 - into the process of putting this video
33:53 - together and also
33:56 - how much footage of devastating natural
33:59 - environments did you have to sift
34:00 - through to get to where you landed like
34:02 - we were we were destroyed watching the
34:06 - like a couple handfuls of clips that you
34:08 - showed us but you know video art as it
34:10 - is you got to look at us so much more
34:12 - just to whittle down to what you want to
34:13 - use right like what was that experience
34:15 - like too
34:16 - yeah oh my gosh um well it's always been
34:19 - tough so i'm i'm in new orleans and i'm
34:22 - from baton rouge so i've lived in the
34:24 - south
34:24 - uh my whole life and so even as a kid
34:27 - you know the idea of kind of hurricanes
34:28 - and hurricane season um has kind of
34:31 - always been around me and so maybe i'm
34:33 - desensitized to it but on top of that
34:35 - being a coastal geologist you know my
34:37 - work is rooted in the sustainability the
34:40 - physical sustainability of uh of
34:43 - southern louisiana and to do that you
34:45 - have to watch so much
34:47 - destruction and that's another sense of
34:49 - scale that um louisiana and other
34:52 - coastal cities definitely face more than
34:54 - you know like more inland cities
34:57 - you know we're kind of faced with
34:58 - tragedy and just
35:00 - complete destruction and into the worlds
35:02 - um multiple times and like almost in a
35:04 - singular generation hurricane camille
35:07 - hurricane betsy katrina
35:09 - um you know right next houston harvey so
35:12 - um
35:13 - a lot of my
35:15 - actual not actually a lot of my research
35:16 - um
35:17 - is you know being very intimate with um
35:20 - a lot of these numbers and
35:22 - understandings of like what happened how
35:24 - it happened at a very almost at a
35:26 - person-to-person level so like
35:28 - understanding natural hazards and
35:30 - mitigation
35:31 - um what's intertwined in that is just
35:35 - unfortunately like incredible sadness so
35:37 - what i
35:39 - have is this whole array a lot of these
35:41 - videos are from classes that i've had
35:44 - since 2011
35:45 - um like the japanese landslide we're
35:47 - looking at um land stability um due to
35:51 - like saturation of rain water and we're
35:53 - just looking at rock slides and so you
35:55 - know a lot of these videos i've just
35:56 - kind of always been thinking about and
35:59 - um
36:00 - what
36:00 - what better time to show it off than the
36:03 - computer mouse conference
36:05 - that's i guess that's where my brain
36:06 - went i don't know i'm kind of always
36:08 - with these things if anybody knows me
36:10 - and there are some that do in the chat
36:12 - hey um you know i'm always watching
36:15 - youtube i'm always like hey check this
36:17 - article out or the radio is always on in
36:19 - my house so it's always just kind of
36:21 - picking from these trees that are kind
36:22 - of growing around me right
36:24 - well i mean
36:26 - i don't i i can't imagine like a better
36:29 - place than the computer mouse conference
36:30 - we're so grateful uh that you had thank
36:33 - you yeah that you that you sent this
36:35 - video our way and that we get to even
36:38 - further un like dive into it because we
36:41 - get to see like a
36:42 - a more detailed version with the
36:44 - captions that we'll post as well we get
36:46 - like part two of this which is actually
36:47 - really novel in a strange way you know
36:50 - yeah
36:52 - um and i think that we we probably have
36:54 - to close even though
36:56 - i we have so many more questions and we
36:59 - can find you on twitter right to
37:00 - continue the conversation if people have
37:02 - more questions for you
37:04 - yeah i'm uh what is it care forgotten
37:08 - uh care forgotten which is again a new
37:10 - orleans reference i'm just stuck here so
37:14 - um but also be in the chat which is
37:16 - amazing if there's anything i can say is
37:18 - like i love
37:20 - the this chat i was just staying in here
37:22 - after it was over yesterday i'm like i'm
37:23 - gonna miss this when it's over so shout
37:25 - out to the chat i'll be in there and
37:27 - answering questions
37:29 - shout out to emma i'm gonna build the
37:31 - site
37:32 - i see you in there ryan so yeah i'm so
37:34 - glad you're there are definitely also
37:35 - already questions there and we will be
37:38 - posting the video with captions
37:41 - as soon as we figure that out so yeah
37:43 - we're sorry about that but thank you so
37:45 - much for your work
37:47 - um yeah thank you for letting me be
37:48 - included in this i appreciate it amazing
37:50 - okay we'll see you soon we'll see you
37:52 - later all righty thanks
37:54 - bye
37:58 - so our next video is dorothy's
38:01 - and after dorothy r santos uh
38:05 - has her video screened which is just so
38:08 - beautiful it's called beyond the life
38:10 - cycle of the object that video is going
38:12 - to be followed by a conversation that
38:14 - was pre-recorded between emma myself and
38:17 - lauren lee mccarthy in reflection
38:20 - uh on that video on dorothy's video yep
38:24 - and then we'll come back after that as a
38:25 - prelude to the panel yes yeah so we'll
38:28 - see you afterwards
38:30 - [Laughter]
38:37 - hi everyone my name is dorothy santos i
38:40 - am the executive director for processing
38:41 - foundation
38:43 - and
38:44 - thank you so much for being here i
38:47 - am going to be presenting today on
38:49 - beyond the life cycle of the object a
38:52 - little bit more about myself i love
38:54 - reading writing
38:56 - researching looking at everything asking
38:58 - questions and making connections
39:01 - i'm really honored again to be
39:02 - presenting my work
39:04 - that i feel and i hope will enable a
39:07 - different type of thinking
39:09 - that goes beyond the life cycle
39:11 - of digital and mobile devices and
39:13 - objects in our lives
39:15 - i also wanted to take the time to thank
39:17 - emma ashley
39:18 - and culture hub and the entire team for
39:20 - putting mouse conference together and
39:22 - allowing me the opportunity to speak
39:24 - with you all today
39:26 - so i have something embarrassing to
39:28 - share
39:30 - uh i've been working on
39:32 - knitting a scarf for my sister for
39:35 - the past decade that's right i said the
39:37 - past decade her favorite color is pink
39:40 - i'm not even sure if that's her favorite
39:41 - color anymore to be honest but the knit
39:44 - and purl stitches
39:46 - and all the imperfections
39:48 - represent these moments of patience in
39:50 - my life
39:52 - that i had the time to sit and take a
39:54 - break and
39:56 - work with my hands in such a way that
39:57 - continues to feel very familiar
40:00 - when i was young my mother
40:02 - taught me how to knit and crochet
40:05 - and you know she wasn't the most patient
40:07 - uh teacher
40:09 - brilliant but not patient
40:11 - but one of the things that i realized in
40:12 - her teaching was
40:14 - how she would tell me stories and how
40:16 - she would
40:17 - uh she would have to actually learn all
40:19 - of these skills so knitting crocheting
40:22 - embroidery
40:23 - uh cooking etc
40:25 - within school it was actually compulsory
40:28 - and it was really difficult to actually
40:30 - mesh
40:31 - a lot more of the filipino traditions
40:34 - within that learning but
40:36 - it also reminded me of how in the
40:38 - philippines there's this really long
40:39 - tradition of weaving and craft within
40:41 - the culture itself
40:43 - but there's something embodied in the
40:45 - practice that becomes ritual and
40:46 - ceremony as well as spiritual
40:50 - so lately in thinking about how i wanted
40:53 - to prepare for this talk
40:55 - i leaned in heavily to lisa nakamura's
40:58 - writing and research about indigenous
41:00 - navajo women and the racialization
41:02 - engendering within the electronic
41:04 - manufacturing industry specifically
41:07 - with the company fairchild semiconductor
41:11 - and the best way that i understood the
41:13 - world or the way the best way that i
41:14 - understand the world i'm sorry is
41:16 - is through artists and poets and
41:20 - more specifically for today i wanted to
41:22 - focus on janice lobo sapigao's work and
41:24 - how she along with nakamura deeply
41:26 - influenced the way
41:28 - that i think about objects in our lives
41:30 - and what it means to hold something in
41:31 - our hands
41:33 - that has probably been held and touched
41:36 - and created by dozens
41:39 - if not hundreds of people
41:41 - and while we may not know for certain
41:44 - thinking about science fiction writer
41:46 - ted chang's work the life cycle of
41:49 - software objects
41:51 - um
41:52 - and even though this story is about
41:54 - raising a digital pet and it that
41:56 - evolves into some sentient mind that's
41:58 - akin to a human mind
41:59 - you know it also makes me wonder
42:01 - well i'm always wondering about
42:03 - what our objects would say to us if they
42:06 - could tell us about where they came from
42:10 - but today i i want to go beyond the life
42:12 - cycle of the object itself whether it is
42:14 - a mouse a microchip a speaker a laptop a
42:17 - smartphone
42:19 - i want for us to remember the human
42:20 - beings responsible for what you hold in
42:22 - your hand
42:23 - and present a type of call to action
42:25 - through the lens of docupoetics the way
42:28 - that zapagawa leaves us these types of
42:30 - instructions in her writing
42:31 - and how we might think beyond these
42:33 - objects
42:35 - and so one of the guiding questions for
42:38 - this conference is this idea of what
42:39 - does the mouse see
42:41 - and while i'm not talking overtly about
42:44 - mice in terms of the computer mouse
42:48 - i'm talking more broadly about how we
42:49 - might want to think about the historical
42:52 - cultural and societal ramifications and
42:55 - impacts of what it means when the
42:57 - technology industry has imprinted
43:00 - and mapped already how a body is seen
43:03 - within its larger infrastructure
43:05 - which nakamura talks about in her
43:07 - title in her essay titled indigenous
43:10 - circuits navajo women
43:12 - and the racialization of early
43:14 - electronic manufacture
43:16 - so i wanted to take a few minutes
43:18 - with some insights um my insights of
43:21 - nakamura's writing
43:23 - before i share janice's work with you
43:25 - all so within this writing nakamura
43:28 - looked at different types of print media
43:31 - from the fairchild semiconductor
43:34 - a company from the late 1960s and early
43:37 - 70s
43:38 - and what it meant to be a woman of color
43:40 - in particular a navajo woman
43:43 - working for the company but most
43:45 - importantly uh writing this as a way to
43:47 - reveal the profound ways in which navajo
43:49 - women played integral and vital roles in
43:52 - the digital revolution
43:55 - she starts off her essay with donna
43:57 - harroway's idea of the integrated
43:59 - circuit from well-known work the cyborg
44:02 - manifesto and my understanding of how
44:05 - well this is my understanding of how the
44:08 - human body becomes a part of this
44:10 - integrated circuit
44:12 - the navajo women in many ways
44:14 - have become part of the integrated
44:16 - circuits through a mythology
44:18 - and through their nimble fingers
44:20 - delicate hands and precision focused as
44:23 - their eyes looked through microscopes
44:25 - and built the silicon valley we know
44:27 - today
44:29 - i couldn't help but think of the
44:31 - materiality of these objects and from
44:33 - where and how they were sourced this is
44:36 - the ebb and flow of understanding i feel
44:39 - often times gets forgotten when we
44:40 - finally have the object in our hands
44:44 - or how the land
44:46 - for which the navajo woman or how they
44:49 - became known as the creative class of
44:51 - technology workers
44:53 - fairchild semiconductors strategically
44:57 - bought land at shiprock new mexico to
44:59 - create a manufacturing plant on the
45:01 - reservation to provide jobs with navajo
45:03 - people
45:05 - and while nakamura doesn't overtly use
45:07 - the term gentrification she does use the
45:09 - term cultural imperialism that happens
45:12 - at spring rock and there's a type of
45:14 - mapping of the navajo body
45:16 - that i mentioned
45:18 - their cultural traditions and practices
45:20 - of weaving and making situate themselves
45:23 - in the eyes of fairchild
45:26 - as the best type of individuals in
45:27 - particular women to be the makers of
45:29 - microchips and semiconductors due to
45:31 - their dexterity speed and precision
45:33 - nakamura states this notion of navajo as
45:36 - quote unquote industrial
45:38 - produced a complicated identity whose
45:41 - formation relied on the idea that the
45:43 - tribe could be modern even hyper modern
45:46 - precisely as a result of being
45:48 - distinctly
45:49 - indian distinctively indian
45:52 - indian identified traits
45:54 - and practices such as painstaking
45:56 - attention to craft an affinity for metal
45:58 - work and textiles were deployed to
46:00 - position the navajo on the cutting edge
46:02 - of the technological moment precisely
46:04 - because of their possession of a
46:06 - racialized set of creative cultural
46:07 - skills and traditional pre-modern
46:10 - artisanal handwork
46:11 - end quote
46:14 - we see what nakamura
46:16 - is talking about very much present in
46:18 - genesis or genocide's work
46:22 - fairchild led people to believe in a
46:25 - method in the mythology
46:26 - that mapped onto the navajo woman's body
46:29 - again as i mentioned and now being very
46:31 - redundant and repetitive about this to
46:33 - emphasize
46:34 - and i think that this is something i
46:36 - feel very powerful about nakamura
46:38 - readings
46:42 - and also reminds me of how we might
46:44 - think of cydia hartman's idea of
46:46 - critical fabulation
46:48 - so i'll stop here to just note that what
46:49 - you're looking at was in the um
46:51 - semiconductor
46:53 - you know decorative uh you know um
46:57 - uh brochure it was a commemorative
46:59 - brochure of uh you know fairchild
47:01 - semiconductor company
47:03 - so this is this was included the images
47:05 - you see here were included in that
47:07 - commemorative brochure or print media
47:10 - so returning back
47:11 - what can we surmise from the things that
47:14 - we see in media and archives
47:16 - now someone uh within media studies
47:20 - this type of media archaeology is so
47:22 - very important to me
47:24 - but i want to move on to janice lobo
47:27 - sapigao's work microchips for millions
47:32 - and although i don't like labels
47:35 - janice's work is absolute uh
47:38 - it's absolutely poetry
47:40 - but there's this embedded practice and
47:42 - practice of docupoetics that is in line
47:45 - with many other writers i so deeply
47:47 - admire such as kathy parkhang vanessa
47:49 - angelica villarreal and vanu kapil
47:53 - and docupoetics is a type of writing
47:55 - practice that requires a listening
47:57 - deeply
47:59 - or
48:00 - pardon me a deep listening and
48:02 - intentionality
48:05 - to your subject matter
48:08 - so i wanted to take some time to go
48:10 - through some of the
48:12 - many pages i'm only showing a few here
48:15 - of uh janice's work so to the left you
48:17 - see microchips for millions of the book
48:20 - cover this is actually this this is her
48:22 - mother
48:24 - and to the right you see a page with uh
48:26 - binary code and at the top of the page
48:29 - it reads let the poetry
48:31 - of this page serve as a moment of
48:33 - recognition for the native peoples
48:36 - the muekma olani tribe whose lands we
48:39 - inhabit
48:41 - uh
48:42 - contemporary contemporaneously known as
48:44 - san jose
48:45 - and at the bottom
48:47 - let these pages allow empathy for the
48:48 - immigrant women and their families whose
48:50 - livelihoods are always always at stake
48:55 - and so i wanted to also show some of the
48:57 - poetry which throughout the book it's
48:59 - really reminiscent of
49:01 - a type of concrete poetry as well as
49:03 - docupoetics
49:05 - and so
49:06 - i can't help it i wish this was i wish
49:08 - janice was reading this herself
49:11 - but um hopefully i can do it some
49:12 - justice i do feel it's important uh to
49:14 - to read through some of the poetry she's
49:16 - written that really
49:18 - reifies a lot of what nakamura was
49:20 - talking about in her essay
49:23 - so the assembly line is what we're
49:25 - looking at now and it has some binary
49:27 - code on it and a lot of the poems
49:30 - that janice writes appear in in columns
49:33 - um as if like running texts very similar
49:36 - to what we might see in code
49:39 - and so it reads my mother is a fab
49:41 - operator four days a week ma gets up at
49:43 - 4am
49:44 - boyle's hot water in a kettle showers
49:46 - before it screams ready for coffee
49:48 - watches the news as she pulls on her
49:50 - clothes
49:51 - jeans and simple tea enough to soak up
49:53 - 12 hour sweat resting in orthopedic
49:55 - shoes that amplify the need for health
49:57 - benefits and overtime
49:59 - ma is always on the front line of
50:00 - silicon valley's shadow
50:02 - one of thousands of women whose nimble
50:04 - fingers and silence grumbling spin
50:06 - microchips for millions powering laptops
50:09 - and cell phones that she herself does
50:10 - not find intuitive enough to use
50:13 - at the end of every day she watches the
50:14 - filipino channel
50:16 - her swollen feet elevated on the living
50:18 - room couch a luxury she buys herself and
50:21 - her family
50:24 - and in terms of docupoetics as i
50:26 - mentioned earlier
50:29 - uh
50:30 - some of the things that are included in
50:32 - in janus's book uh are snippets found in
50:36 - uh print media
50:38 - of what has been said of the women who
50:39 - work within
50:40 - these industries
50:42 - so to the left you'll see a quoted text
50:45 - that reads by the early 1980s filipinos
50:48 - were one of the largest ethnic groups
50:49 - among asian workers at national
50:51 - semiconductor corporation nsc in san
50:53 - jose california
50:56 - you see binary code and then you see at
50:57 - the bottom
50:58 - in text again um
51:00 - ma says she's a fab operator
51:02 - and so just to quickly note
51:04 - uh fairchild semiconductor
51:06 - was
51:08 - in in shiprock was
51:10 - uh operational in the late 60s and 70s
51:13 - but
51:14 - a lot of this work um was going overseas
51:16 - to asia as well as mexico
51:19 - and then to the right of the screen
51:21 - you see another quote
51:24 - this mostly female labor force was
51:26 - appealing to management for a number of
51:28 - reasons one many were fluent in english
51:30 - two many had experience working in
51:32 - philippine electronics plants and three
51:34 - they had a reputation for hard work and
51:36 - for
51:37 - they were considered obedient
51:40 - to
51:41 - authority
51:43 - again you see the code
51:45 - and at the bottom it says i know she's
51:47 - an assembly line worker
51:51 - and so i want to show a couple more
51:52 - pieces that i feel really
51:55 - are um
51:56 - indicative of what nakamura was talking
51:58 - about in her research of the fairchild
52:00 - semiconductor archives
52:02 - but you see it almost come to life in uh
52:04 - janice's poetry
52:06 - so
52:07 - again before i end i just want to share
52:09 - a couple more pieces this one is called
52:11 - the clean room
52:13 - in order to come in you must first put
52:15 - on one hair net two shoe covers three
52:17 - gloves four mask five hood
52:19 - six coverall seven boot covers eight
52:22 - goggles nine gloves
52:24 - when you exit you must discard one
52:26 - gloves two goggles three hood four mask
52:28 - five boot covers
52:30 - and to the right you see text that we
52:33 - can assume
52:34 - it is safe to assume again through the
52:36 - docupoedic style
52:38 - that this might be
52:42 - janus's mother
52:45 - uh so i'll read that text to the right
52:46 - column
52:48 - no you cannot bring anything inside the
52:50 - room no cell phones no watch no nothing
52:52 - you have to go to the changing room
52:54 - before you go into work i always wear my
52:56 - headband they don't like you to wear
52:59 - sneakers they like you where the shoes
53:01 - they give you my feet is hurt
53:03 - it's hard to breathe sometimes oh my god
53:06 - you can only call me on my break okay 8
53:08 - 30 or 12 30.
53:10 - i can only wear t-shirts to lose kind
53:11 - for work it's better because you sweat a
53:13 - lot
53:14 - i can't balasang i can't
53:16 - you have to wear a suit goggles
53:19 - everything is covered everything you
53:20 - can't touch anything
53:22 - you have gloves they will get mad on you
53:26 - and finally something that i wanted and
53:29 - i'm barely scratching the surface here
53:30 - uh in my presentation for you all but
53:34 - this goes back to
53:35 - what i mentioned with nakamura may not
53:37 - have overtly said that this is
53:39 - gentrification
53:41 - but
53:42 - this is a way of how capitalism works
53:45 - through the environment
53:47 - through um profiting off the land of
53:49 - peoples
53:51 - and the after effects and ramifications
53:54 - of the environment and you know
53:56 - the people that um
53:58 - you know steward the land but then for
54:00 - generations to come we see that in the
54:02 - valley of toxic fright um which is the
54:04 - last uh poem that i'll share from
54:06 - janice's book
54:08 - so to the left there's a screenshot of a
54:09 - map of san jose or
54:12 - um that county and the center of it you
54:14 - see
54:15 - uh you know sunnyvale santa clara san
54:18 - jose
54:19 - and there is a box that is uh
54:23 - you know uh bolded with the text to the
54:26 - immediate right
54:28 - in white that says a plume is a long
54:31 - cloud of smoke a vapor spreading from
54:33 - its point of origin
54:36 - and to the right of that this is on the
54:38 - opposite page of the map is
54:42 - janice's poem the class
54:45 - in college i took an environmental
54:47 - racism class my professor showed a map
54:49 - of my neighborhood in san jose with
54:52 - curious red dots next to the mcdonald's
54:54 - grandma worked at
54:55 - near my elementary school one north of
54:58 - ma's workplace he said the dots
55:00 - indicated toxic waste sites said
55:02 - immigrant women were on the front line
55:03 - of exploitation half of the professor's
55:05 - lecture was about the bunny suit he said
55:08 - employees are told to protect them
55:10 - are told it's to protect them from
55:12 - chemical harm
55:14 - bunny suits protect microchips from
55:16 - human germs
55:19 - and so
55:20 - thank you
55:21 - for listening to all of that i really do
55:23 - highly recommend
55:24 - um looking into janice's work
55:28 - and beyond so as you see here going
55:30 - beyond the life cycle of the object and
55:32 - what does that mean so now that i've
55:33 - shared janice's work i wanted to express
55:35 - how i feel um and how it serves as a
55:38 - conduit to understanding the kind of
55:40 - conditions indigenous women and women of
55:42 - color are subjected to within the
55:44 - electronic manufacturing
55:46 - and technology industries and still to
55:48 - this day
55:49 - and in sharing my thoughts
55:51 - which again barely scratch the surface
55:53 - of what nakamura and zafigo's work or
55:56 - janus's work is doing um with media
55:58 - science and technology studies and
56:00 - within the arts i wanted to share one
56:02 - last important quote from nakamura's
56:04 - work when she reflects on the depiction
56:06 - of women of color within tech through
56:08 - media she writes quote
56:11 - instead we see asian women latinas and
56:13 - navajo women and other women of color
56:16 - looking inside digital culture means
56:18 - looking
56:20 - back in time to the roots of the
56:22 - computing industry and the specific
56:24 - material production practices that
56:26 - positioned
56:27 - race and gender as commodities and
56:29 - electronic factories this labor is
56:31 - temporarily hidden
56:32 - within a very early period of digital
56:35 - computing history and hidden spatially
56:38 - we must look to locales and bodies not
56:41 - commonly associated within these or with
56:43 - these industries
56:45 - in out of the way places to see how race
56:48 - operates as a key aspect of digital
56:51 - platform production and quote
56:54 - so with that i wanted to encourage you
56:56 - all to think about these different ways
56:59 - and
57:00 - that media affects the way we understand
57:02 - narratives being told to us
57:04 - especially queer trans black indigenous
57:07 - people of color and people with
57:09 - disabilities
57:10 - i also want to encourage you to all read
57:12 - and examine the works of artists a lot
57:15 - like janice logos
57:17 - to understand technology in a way that
57:19 - is outside of the reach of the object
57:21 - and outside of capitalism
57:24 - i think that's one of the things i
57:25 - really wanted to focus on within this
57:27 - talk
57:28 - but also to remind everyone of the
57:30 - immense amount of work there is for us
57:31 - to do
57:33 - and learning and being accountable
57:34 - within those ecologies
57:37 - um thank you so much i really appreciate
57:39 - you all and
57:41 - i am i'm done with my talk
57:51 - i think i mean
57:53 - so yeah dorothy doesn't directly talk
57:56 - about the mouse um
57:58 - i don't think at any point but
58:00 - there's so much um
58:03 - like indirect connection and i think
58:04 - like the strongest connection for me was
58:06 - just talking about
58:09 - um like hands and the hands that go into
58:12 - the making of electronic objects and i
58:14 - think
58:15 - the mouse at least in the research that
58:17 - i've done has is so much about the fact
58:19 - that we hold it and it's this very
58:21 - personal object and yet it's very
58:25 - not personal because it doesn't really
58:27 - hold information like you simply hold it
58:29 - all day
58:30 - um and so it's this reminder of the body
58:32 - but it's also a reminder that you know
58:34 - like the violence of the
58:36 - uh the tech that goes into making the
58:38 - mouse or the industry that goes into
58:40 - making the mouse
58:41 - so so for me it is like directly it sits
58:44 - directly within this conference really
58:46 - well um
58:48 - yeah
58:50 - yeah i mean for me it the first thing it
58:52 - made me
58:54 - think about was
58:55 - i guess the thought that dorothy's talk
58:57 - brought up for me was just the way that
58:59 - um
59:00 - when you think about the mouse or any
59:02 - kind of physical artifact of technology
59:06 - um
59:06 - it it feels like there is this direct
59:10 - connection to
59:12 - you know the history of that making of
59:14 - that object like even a mouse that is
59:15 - something personal that you
59:17 - really are the only one that touches
59:18 - maybe was something that was made by
59:20 - someone else and transferred several
59:22 - times and i think a lot of times when we
59:23 - think about
59:25 - you know the way we've been
59:26 - communicating for the past year
59:27 - primarily which is like through
59:29 - screens and networks there's sometimes a
59:31 - tendency to feel like
59:33 - um
59:34 - that history is is separated from it
59:36 - right that there it's more feminine
59:38 - maybe um
59:40 - although it's not and i think that was
59:42 - the the other nice part of dorothy's
59:44 - talk was that
59:45 - you know she's talking about microchips
59:48 - so even when we have that feeling that
59:50 - the internet is something intangible in
59:52 - in contrast to something physical
59:54 - you know there is that whole physical
59:56 - infrastructure um that makes me think of
59:58 - like you know ingrid burnington's work
60:00 - also like just surfacing that that
60:02 - architecture and infrastructure and the
60:04 - physicality of it
60:07 - i think it's intentionally severed from
60:09 - the physicality of it right um
60:11 - and i think what's really interesting
60:13 - about dorothy's is not only does she
60:14 - paint that picture for us in
60:17 - poetry and in storytelling but also in
60:21 - the
60:22 - presumed
60:23 - uh
60:24 - prioritization of technology over people
60:27 - um we were just talking about the as it
60:31 - was airing we were just talking about
60:32 - the
60:33 - bunny suit comment
60:34 - as well that was such a
60:37 - a very intense way to end this talk to
60:40 - really hammer home
60:42 - what is important over who is important
60:44 - in the construction of all of this and
60:46 - that's
60:48 - even more uh extended
60:51 - when we realize that these are not
60:53 - stories that we hear in tandem like we
60:55 - don't hear stories about the technology
60:56 - and the people in tandem maybe you hear
60:58 - about certainly you hear about inventors
61:00 - or
61:01 - you know figureheads like steve jobs and
61:04 - doug engelbert but you don't hear about
61:06 - the
61:07 - fabricators and the technology in tandem
61:10 - um
61:11 - and there's a reason for it and that
61:12 - reason is um articulated inadvertently
61:15 - through that bunny suit comment right um
61:18 - because it's not it's it's not who
61:19 - matters it's not what matters right
61:23 - yeah the bunny suit comment really um or
61:26 - just that idea that it protects the
61:28 - microchip
61:29 - more than it protects the worker or
61:31 - that's for the microchip and not the
61:33 - worker
61:34 - uh really kind of blew my mind at least
61:37 - how it was presented in the poem also
61:39 - like it really hit harder
61:41 - in a way that it hadn't before
61:43 - um and and i think just like complicates
61:46 - the mouse like again it's this personal
61:47 - object but but really
61:50 - is prioritizing your computer over you
61:52 - in many many ways i think over and over
61:55 - again like it's prioritizing the
61:56 - graphical user interface over how you
61:59 - might want to interact with a computer
62:01 - at all i think
62:03 - yeah
62:05 - yeah i mean it's um
62:07 - it's funny to think about you know user
62:09 - interface or user interaction design or
62:12 - any of these things that um or even like
62:14 - user centered design
62:16 - um
62:17 - i think what what the talk pointed to is
62:20 - you know and what we're talking about is
62:21 - how the the whole notion of that is
62:23 - really
62:24 - opposite right that that it is not about
62:27 - the people in the system the people in
62:29 - the system are really there to
62:32 - serve the underlying structure which is
62:34 - you know capitalism and technical
62:36 - solutionism and
62:38 - you know white supremacy at
62:40 - the bottom of it um
62:42 - i was really another phrase that stuck
62:44 - out to me
62:45 - from the talk and i don't remember if
62:46 - dorothy said it or if she's quoting lisa
62:48 - nakamura but just this idea that
62:50 - capitalism works the environment
62:54 - and i was thinking also about like
62:57 - environment the relationship between
62:59 - environment and people and how when
63:02 - you're talking about
63:03 - you know indigenous
63:05 - people like that connection is so strong
63:08 - and i think that's something that we
63:09 - have a much
63:11 - weaker understanding of a lot of time
63:13 - when we're sitting behind our computer
63:15 - so that that's an unresolved thought but
63:17 - those are some of the um
63:19 - like entities that were floating around
63:21 - in my mind when she was talking about
63:22 - that
63:24 - uh uh that really resonate resonated
63:26 - with me too i couldn't imagine and i and
63:29 - by that i mean i very well could
63:31 - because there have been
63:33 - similar kinds of interactions that i've
63:34 - experienced myself but i couldn't
63:36 - imagine
63:36 - the
63:38 - experience of um
63:40 - the writer in that story
63:43 - they were taking a a
63:46 - a technologies class and the professor
63:48 - showed a map of their own home
63:51 - region their own home city with dots
63:53 - articulating that these are the places
63:55 - that have the highest regions of
63:57 - toxicity and the highest regions of
63:59 - exploitation as well and and to be
64:01 - sitting like i i just know
64:04 - firsthand in lots of context but for so
64:06 - many people of color
64:07 - inside of technology classes listening
64:09 - to stories that are not about you
64:13 - but they are about a a group of people
64:16 - that you are also defined with and and
64:18 - and how those stories are so
64:21 - um
64:22 - they really articulate the power and the
64:24 - like economic uh economic and
64:26 - environmental like violence that takes
64:28 - place in those areas and you're
64:30 - listening to that and you have to
64:34 - decide whether you attach yourself to
64:35 - that moment or if you divorce yourself
64:37 - from that moment in order to be able to
64:39 - like participate in the room and i think
64:41 - that dorothy's talk didn't talk about
64:43 - that overtly but it did weave in and out
64:45 - the personal connection to these asian
64:47 - heritages and the personal connection to
64:50 - the like identities that she's talking
64:51 - about and
64:52 - um i just feel like really akin to that
64:55 - kind of relationship understanding um
64:57 - those moments like where it becomes
64:59 - really close and personal and when it
65:01 - becomes really distant and
65:02 - informationally driven
65:04 - uh that was like a
65:06 - intense moment for me in her talk
65:12 - yeah i'm pausing so i'm thinking about
65:15 - that i mean one of the things that
65:17 - um
65:19 - i really appreciated was the closing
65:22 - where you know she's telling the story
65:24 - that
65:25 - like you said some is informational
65:27 - some is very personal to the writer some
65:30 - you know is personal to dorothy too
65:33 - and um
65:34 - but she directs redirects it back at the
65:37 - listener at the end um
65:39 - you know and she started open by talking
65:42 - about this idea of deep listening to
65:44 - subject matter and then she kind of ends
65:46 - it saying okay so you've been listening
65:48 - so
65:49 - how how do we learn from this how do we
65:51 - be accountable
65:52 - um so i really liked that that call to
65:55 - action but i'm also
65:57 - um thinking about what you just said
65:59 - ashley and like how
66:00 - how do you
66:02 - how do you find that accountability
66:04 - um
66:05 - when
66:05 - [Music]
66:07 - it
66:08 - um
66:09 - how to say like how to find that
66:10 - accountability when when
66:12 - you how do you balance that with like
66:14 - just self-protection sometimes right
66:19 - yeah
66:20 - and it's not
66:21 - none of these systems of
66:23 - um
66:24 - of learning about the history of
66:26 - computing
66:28 - protect the person of color that might
66:29 - be associated to that
66:31 - because the way that we learn about
66:33 - these systems is also from the
66:34 - perspective of the most powerful
66:36 - demographics as well so there's no like
66:39 - training that that a facilitator would
66:41 - go through to say oh this is the part
66:43 - where we talk about how this
66:44 - technological company
66:46 - ravaged like an entire black and brown
66:48 - neighborhood i wonder if there are black
66:50 - and brown people who maybe have family
66:52 - who live in that neighborhood or even
66:53 - live there themselves like there is no
66:55 - framework for that so it becomes
66:58 - like
66:58 - listeners choice to engage or listeners
67:02 - responsibility to engage or or more so
67:04 - like listeners like
67:06 - additive trauma so i think that that's
67:09 - the accountability part is still sort of
67:10 - murky because we have no we don't have
67:13 - we haven't built a conversational
67:15 - framework for addressing that head-on or
67:17 - in any kind of confrontational way right
67:19 - and that's why it talks like dorothy's
67:20 - are so important because they like peel
67:22 - back all of that um
67:25 - all of that like covering that we have
67:27 - to talk about these things abstractly
67:28 - and really talk about it from the humans
67:30 - perspective like the true
67:32 - lived experience of of like marginalized
67:35 - folks who have made this technology
67:37 - possible it becomes uncomfortable
67:39 - because we're not used to it but from
67:40 - that positionality you know
67:45 - it's definitely i i'm just thinking
67:48 - about um
67:49 - [Music]
67:51 - all of the problematic ways in which
67:53 - technology like the pedagogy of
67:55 - technology like how
67:58 - the speed kind of like
68:00 - the the way in which it's taught and the
68:02 - way in which things are glossed over
68:03 - like the violence of of what goes into
68:06 - making a microchip is glossed over
68:08 - when you're
68:09 - trying to learn what a microchip is
68:16 - hi we're back
68:18 - um we're back live because you just saw
68:21 - our faces technically in a pre-recorded
68:24 - video it's the magic of
68:25 - the internet
68:27 - the end
68:28 - and so we are
68:30 - so excited because
68:32 - we're closing on
68:34 - such a dynamic note we've got three
68:37 - spectacular panelists and this is really
68:39 - cool for us too because the computer
68:41 - mouse conference in 2019 also closed on
68:43 - a panel and it was so much fun and uh
68:47 - there were so many jumpsuits on that
68:49 - panel
68:50 - there were three
68:52 - three out of four people sitting on that
68:54 - panel or a jumpsuit which is pretty
68:56 - surreal we'll find out in a second if io
68:59 - is still wearing a jumpsuit but we've
69:02 - got one returning uh panelist from last
69:05 - year io and you'll hear a bit more about
69:07 - him in a moment we've also got some
69:09 - incredible incredible people that we
69:10 - really look up to allison and mimi um
69:13 - before we get to reading their bios and
69:15 - telling you more about them um i just
69:17 - want to shout out a couple of things
69:19 - the first thing is that we're in the
69:21 - last chunk of the conference this is
69:23 - really the last opportunity to
69:25 - contribute to the computer mouse zine so
69:28 - neda bomani with help from the coding
69:30 - train
69:32 - and dan schiffman's twitter bot is still
69:34 - they're still collecting assets and
69:37 - people have been really freaking out
69:39 - about how incredible the zine has been
69:41 - today and so this would be a great time
69:43 - to tweet uh a contribution and get your
69:46 - um contribution embedded into the zine
69:49 - because people have been really in love
69:50 - with what they've been seeing and it
69:52 - would be cool to be a part of that
69:53 - artifact
69:54 - um and
69:56 - i think that with that said we're ready
69:59 - to jump into some of the panels
70:03 - yeah so um i'm going to introduce

75:58 - computer mouse conference
76:00 - uh io and lane nune and tiga brain all
76:04 - joined us for a closing panel and we
76:05 - opened with a question that we wanted to
76:07 - open with today as well
76:09 - which is really simple
76:11 - it's just
76:12 - wondering if you could tell us a little
76:14 - bit about your first time using the
76:16 - computer mouse
76:18 - and because io is our returner maybe you
76:20 - could retell your story and then we'll
76:22 - go
76:23 - alison mimi
76:27 - yeah i don't i don't remember my story
76:29 - that's um that's the thing i hope i
76:31 - don't retell the same story
76:34 - um
76:35 - i
76:36 - i know that
76:38 - when i was really young i tried to build
76:40 - a computer mouse or i tried to build
76:42 - something to interact with the computer
76:45 - um and i was not successful um
76:49 - but
76:50 - yeah i think that's that's one of my
76:52 - stories um
76:53 - yeah i remember i remember some of that
76:55 - story yeah um it was like a story about
76:58 - your
76:59 - mom or dad
77:01 - working on a computer building a
77:02 - computer together
77:04 - yes yes yes it was a story about my dad
77:07 - um
77:09 - we got a computer
77:11 - um no
77:13 - i was i was crocheting yeah and my dad
77:16 - saw me
77:17 - and he he got me a light bulb and a
77:20 - battery and connected it and then ever
77:22 - since then i was like oh wow computers
77:24 - but then i also love
77:26 - crocheting as well so i've continued to
77:28 - crochet and do computer stuff wearable
77:31 - technology
77:33 - yeah
77:34 - right right that's the story which is
77:36 - which is really cool because it connects
77:38 - to so much of what psy presented
77:40 - yesterday and what dorothy just
77:41 - presented before this but maybe we'll
77:44 - put a pin in that and go
77:46 - to allison um
77:47 - and ask the same question what was your
77:49 - first experience with the computer mouse
77:53 - yeah i was i was thinking about this
77:56 - actually um which is weird because i
77:58 - didn't know this was going to be your
77:59 - question
78:00 - um i think i was thinking about it in
78:02 - terms of the fact that i feel like
78:06 - maybe
78:08 - most of the people who are presenting at
78:09 - the conference
78:11 - their first interaction with the
78:13 - computer included a mouse
78:15 - just based on the ages of everyone as
78:18 - far as i can as far as i can guess and
78:20 - mine didn't i i
78:22 - don't remember
78:22 - [Music]
78:24 - i definitely like was using computers
78:26 - before
78:27 - there were mice
78:28 - um like our first uh home computer was a
78:32 - tandy color computer too that did not
78:34 - have a mouse
78:35 - um
78:36 - so i was trying to think through like
78:38 - where what what is the most likely
78:39 - scenario
78:40 - where i would have encountered a mouse
78:41 - for the first time because it wouldn't
78:42 - have been in school we would have had
78:43 - like apple twos in the apple in in the
78:46 - lab it wouldn't have been
78:47 - at home like my my dad had like a ibm pc
78:51 - that he used for work stuff um
78:54 - so it was definitely a mac so it was
78:56 - either it was either like a classic mac
78:59 - that was at my friend's house across the
79:01 - street
79:02 - because they always had the newest
79:03 - computer stuff
79:05 - um or maybe it was like at my dad's work
79:07 - or something like that um
79:10 - i i do have a very distinct memory of
79:12 - like with my friends
79:14 - um going through
79:16 - their family computer and we found this
79:18 - folder labeled
79:20 - misc m-i-s-c
79:22 - and we didn't know that it stood for
79:23 - miscellaneous we thought it meant music
79:26 - so we we clicked into the folder and
79:28 - just started messing around i have no
79:29 - idea we probably messed it up really bad
79:31 - um so i'm afraid
79:34 - george fisher if you're if you're
79:35 - watching i'm sorry i messed up your
79:37 - miscellaneous folder
79:39 - 34 years ago or whatever but yeah i
79:42 - don't i don't really remember but it
79:43 - must have been it must have been a
79:44 - scenario like that
79:46 - that's a great yeah story and makes me i
79:49 - i am like a post mouse my i don't
79:51 - remember either but i'm definitely a
79:53 - post mouse um computer user like i
79:56 - didn't have a pre mouse computer
79:57 - experience the great the great
79:59 - generational divide yes
80:01 - the well-known generational divide
80:05 - cool uh mimi what about you
80:08 - um
80:09 - yeah i don't know i don't i don't think
80:11 - i can remember you all had nice little
80:13 - neat stories that was very convenient of
80:15 - the two of you um
80:17 - i don't think i remember the first time
80:19 - i used a mouse
80:20 - i do remember
80:22 - i'll say my most vivid earliest memories
80:24 - probably when i was about
80:26 - eight or nine
80:27 - and we had an old we had some mac in our
80:30 - house and i remember there was a summer
80:32 - when one of my good friends who lived
80:34 - close enough that i could walk or bike
80:36 - to her house we were obsessed with just
80:38 - emailing each other back and forth and
80:40 - it was like weeks where we didn't see
80:41 - each other in person because we were
80:43 - like oh my god have you heard email
80:45 - let's do this and it's so funny thinking
80:47 - about now
80:48 - like that is
80:50 - that is not how i would feel today i can
80:52 - tell you that
80:53 - um that's probably my most like vivid
80:55 - earliest memory since i don't remember
80:57 - the first time
80:58 - that's still a good story that's a great
81:00 - yeah i like the stories that just kind
81:02 - of bring you back to like uh when you
81:04 - would just walk down the street or i
81:06 - don't know to somewhere like close by to
81:09 - your friend's house to use their
81:11 - computer yeah
81:13 - i don't know
81:14 - it feels really far away from my
81:17 - experience these days well yeah i'm
81:18 - never walking to your house to use your
81:20 - computer not these days
81:23 - um
81:24 - i mean now you could just um vnc into it
81:28 - right right as we do we we've been doing
81:31 - a lot of yeah uh we have been using this
81:34 - tool called teamviewer with culturehub
81:37 - um yeah where we
81:38 - they take over our computer to do stuff
81:40 - so so yeah it's and they take over the
81:42 - cursor and it's a very weird experience
81:45 - um
81:46 - okay so i want to just i
81:49 - um
81:52 - have a
81:54 - question
81:55 - like th so this year our theme um
81:59 - is
82:00 - a little more specific
82:02 - uh it's what does the mouse see
82:05 - um and so a bunch of people
82:08 - uh throughout the conference as you may
82:10 - have seen have stretched this question
82:11 - in different ways
82:13 - um so like charlton asks does the mouse
82:15 - see race and he actually he answers the
82:18 - question he says yes it does because
82:20 - computing technology
82:22 - is predicated on race and racism and
82:24 - racialization um
82:26 - david kind of asks says that the mouse
82:28 - sees and clicks and that clicks have a
82:30 - kind of currency and that there's all
82:31 - this like meaning that's multiplied on
82:33 - top of the click
82:36 - um yeah and so we wanted to basically
82:40 - ask you the unfair question as if you
82:43 - were presenting like right now like what
82:45 - what does the mouse see
82:48 - and i think that this is like you know
82:50 - our speakers had
82:52 - weeks months to think about what the
82:54 - mouse sees um but i would be curious to
82:56 - know like
82:58 - you know measured in clicks seeing
83:00 - racing pixelizations on a on a track pad
83:03 - like what is the mouse what would you
83:04 - say that the mouse sees or if you just
83:06 - push back on this question because i
83:08 - also like i feel like i still i just
83:10 - can't even answer begin to answer this
83:12 - question even though so many people have
83:14 - answered it throughout
83:15 - today and yesterday yeah
83:17 - yeah
83:20 - i could take a stab at it you know and
83:24 - maybe this is coming from you know from
83:26 - the research that i've been doing lately
83:28 - i i'm thinking about time and i think
83:30 - ryan touched on this a little bit
83:32 - um and really thinking about the scale
83:36 - um of time so i i in a sense for me the
83:40 - mouse is sort of complicit in this um
83:44 - idea of the proliferation of violent
83:47 - images right and thinking about the time
83:50 - it takes so less if we if one takes time
83:53 - as
83:54 - um
83:55 - just even think about the com the mouse
83:57 - itself and the clock in the computer and
84:00 - needing to have that time signature
84:02 - correct to communicate but then also
84:04 - scale back and think about the anxiety
84:06 - of you know
84:08 - clicking on something and the immediacy
84:11 - of okay that it appears and what happens
84:13 - when that breaks down right but then now
84:16 - thinking adding violence and and race to
84:19 - that and thinking about over the over
84:20 - the summer all these videos and images
84:23 - that have been coming out and it is a
84:25 - mouse that enables you to to view that
84:27 - right and by clicking on it you see
84:30 - those images and then even beyond that
84:32 - like then being able to scroll those
84:34 - images right move them faster or slower
84:37 - pause it at the particular place so for
84:40 - me i'm thinking about and then
84:43 - further further more right than the
84:45 - multiplication of that um over
84:49 - you know thousands or hundreds of
84:51 - thousands of people and what that means
84:53 - in terms of the the way the mouse
84:56 - manages
84:57 - the dissemination of these uh of these
85:00 - images
85:01 - um and i i'm going to bring this
85:04 - back to um
85:05 - to
85:06 - ela couti's um
85:09 - water get no enemy um and because he
85:12 - talks about water in this sort of um
85:15 - cosmic way right he starts out this
85:17 - really external about water being used
85:19 - to wash and then water being used to
85:21 - drink and then in the center the core of
85:24 - it is he says when your child dies you
85:27 - use water um and in terms of crime and i
85:30 - think about trauma and
85:33 - and and time
85:35 - we're related to the that ability to
85:38 - sort of
85:39 - instantaneously
85:41 - click
85:42 - you know and to scroll to pause
85:45 - right
85:47 - i mean you're bringing up a lot of parts
85:48 - of charlton's talk as well right um
85:52 - yeah and all of the ways in which like
85:55 - the mouse
85:57 - creates
85:58 - more access as you're describing more
86:01 - opportunity to be connected to some of
86:02 - the movements you saw in the summer but
86:03 - also the the violence of being able to
86:06 - replay and
86:07 - and the like breakdown just destruction
86:10 - of being able to use the mouse in that
86:11 - way yeah it's also i mean i think
86:13 - sometimes i feel like
86:16 - um
86:17 - i put too much weight on the mouse or
86:19 - something like like to give the mouse
86:21 - get to give it over to too much
86:23 - responsibility to the mouse but then i
86:25 - think yeah like charlton says like the
86:27 - mouse is the thing
86:28 - that made personal computer like
86:31 - that made this infrastructure
86:33 - possible like so the mouse is
86:35 - responsible you know given its kind of
86:37 - relational um position and computing
86:41 - for
86:41 - yeah yeah kind of sustaining
86:44 - um
86:46 - yeah all the violence which which it
86:48 - sustains i don't know yeah right but
86:50 - it's but it's also cool to think about
86:51 - the mouse
86:53 - in that violence in the in the timeline
86:54 - of history that the mouse has like
86:56 - witnessed and then thinking about it in
86:57 - like time in relation to ryan's talk as
87:00 - well is really is really interesting
87:02 - and
87:03 - you know no pressure if you don't feel
87:06 - engaged to this question but i'd be
87:08 - curious mimi or allison if you had like
87:10 - a an interpretation of what the mouse
87:12 - sees as well
87:18 - you just you just
87:19 - you took a breath in mimi as though you
87:21 - were about to you know
87:23 - i definitely gestured to you
87:25 - um but no
87:28 - i mean i'm happy i can also talk i don't
87:29 - have anything um really really
87:32 - i don't know if i have too much
87:33 - significance to add i i don't know
87:37 - i have actually thought about this
87:38 - question because it's just come up it's
87:40 - the same in the conference and because i
87:42 - think loads of people all of the people
87:43 - who have spoken or contributed things
87:46 - over the past two days have had such
87:48 - such lovely little takes around this
87:51 - whereas i just keep thinking about my
87:52 - own mouse i'm like what does my mouth
87:55 - seem
87:56 - too much
87:57 - um or and then i actually end up back at
88:00 - this place
88:01 - this thing that you were coming coming
88:03 - to as well io this mouse is witness as
88:05 - mediator as tool
88:07 - as complicit and then also as not
88:10 - as relational necessarily definitely
88:16 - also as something you know the sea i
88:18 - think i also come back i've been
88:20 - circling around this question so i don't
88:21 - have any good good answers just the
88:23 - little things i'm thinking about the
88:24 - things it brings up i think about how i
88:27 - the c what is the mouse c
88:29 - is prop that c is probably the the thing
88:31 - i struggle with the most and i think why
88:33 - does it have to be c and i think i'm not
88:35 - the only person i other people over the
88:36 - past two days i'm sure have brought this
88:38 - up too because when i think of the mouse
88:39 - i think so much more of touching and
88:42 - sensing rather than seeing and
88:45 - i don't have a good answer but that's
88:48 - that's sort of where i end up
88:49 - yeah i mean if it helps i don't have a
88:51 - good answer either
88:52 - yeah
88:53 - yeah but touch is something we want to
88:55 - talk about yeah yeah
88:57 - yeah and the way in which it's
88:58 - relational we're coming back to that too
89:02 - allison what say you
89:06 - um so i was
89:08 - i'm i'm i'm
89:10 - i'm trying to think about this i don't
89:12 - for some reason i didn't imagine that i
89:14 - could help
89:15 - to
89:16 - to answer this question even though it's
89:18 - right there in the name of the of the
89:21 - conference and i'm on this panel that
89:23 - doesn't have any other uh
89:25 - any other mission other than to talk
89:27 - about the conference
89:28 - um
89:29 - i i think i think the talk that that
89:31 - that really connected with me the most
89:33 - was um david bearing porter's talk um
89:36 - about the the semiotics of the click
89:39 - um something that i i feel like
89:44 - happened in that
89:46 - well didn't didn't really happen in that
89:48 - talk but
89:49 - but um
89:50 - thinking about
89:52 - the click as this like um
89:55 - as this like very rudimentary biometric
89:58 - device
90:00 - that is like constantly recording
90:02 - real-time information about what i'm
90:04 - doing in remote parts of the world um
90:07 - which of course is is very true
90:10 - um that was really disturbing to think
90:11 - about
90:12 - it made me think the the next thing that
90:15 - i jumped to in my mind was like um
90:18 - where like uh heat maps of where people
90:21 - click on a web page and it's just
90:23 - something you can bring up in like
90:25 - analytics tools if you do web
90:26 - development like
90:28 - it will actually show you like a picture
90:30 - of your web page with like you know a
90:32 - heat map of where people are most likely
90:34 - to click
90:35 - that's also what um you can get heat
90:37 - maps of that for where people look when
90:39 - they look at your web page right
90:42 - or at a book or something like that
90:43 - they're actual
90:44 - studies where they show like this is
90:46 - this is where people's eyes are drawn
90:48 - and like the order in which their eyes
90:49 - are drawn to things so i think something
90:52 - that that maybe didn't come out in these
90:54 - talks or maybe that i didn't that i
90:56 - didn't notice is the fact that
90:58 - where you move your mouse also isn't
91:00 - entirely intentional right like the
91:03 - the content the thing that's on your
91:05 - screen is conditioning where your mouse
91:07 - moves the same way that a written text
91:09 - conditions where your eye moves from
91:11 - from one point
91:13 - um or like over time while you're while
91:15 - you're looking at the page like the
91:16 - mouse is
91:17 - um
91:18 - i guess here's here's here's the clever
91:21 - phrasing that i came up with it's like
91:22 - maybe the important question isn't what
91:24 - the mouse sees but where does the mouse
91:25 - look
91:29 - and and where is the gaze of the mouse
91:31 - drawn maybe against our intention
91:35 - right
91:36 - right sorry i feel proud of that
91:38 - i feel like i mean now i just wonder
91:42 - it was nice
91:45 - i'm wondering like um i i'm just now
91:48 - curious to know like in my own uh use of
91:52 - a mouse and my own eyes on the screen
91:55 - where they don't where they match up and
91:57 - where they don't yeah like where my
91:58 - mouse is kind of making its own or my
92:00 - hand is making its own decisions and my
92:02 - eyes are trying to do something else you
92:03 - know like where there's uh tension
92:05 - between those two that would be right it
92:07 - would be interesting to see a heat map
92:09 - of the mouse of mouse movement and mouse
92:11 - clicks over a heat map of
92:13 - eye movements right yeah i feel like
92:15 - very
92:17 - very intense choreography that that
92:19 - definitely people
92:21 - are getting paid a lot of money to
92:23 - to choreograph to make us click on the
92:25 - things they want us to perform right
92:27 - yeah
92:28 - really overlap overlaid across some
92:31 - different kinds of like
92:32 - web styles and seeing what prescribes
92:35 - like what kinds of interactions and
92:38 - things like that's really interesting
92:40 - yeah i think yeah this go ahead mimi
92:44 - i was just gonna say to this to this
92:45 - point it reminds me i have this work
92:47 - which is a video piece but it's sort of
92:49 - a scrolling thing and there's one part
92:52 - of the piece which is that there's a
92:53 - cursor on the screen you can't tell i'm
92:55 - moving my cursor while i'm saying this
92:57 - but there's this cursor on the screen
92:59 - and the cursor is sort of a stand in
93:01 - this mouse which is going to stand in
93:02 - for a person who is moving the mouse and
93:05 - it is meant to really do this exact
93:08 - sort of choreography and like this this
93:10 - moving back and forth that you're
93:11 - talking about alison of directing people
93:14 - in this work
93:16 - not just where to look but also sort of
93:18 - reminding them that it's a piece and
93:19 - there's meant to be somebody else
93:21 - looking at it and so it's something i
93:23 - hadn't thought about until you brought
93:24 - this up but this use of the mouse where
93:26 - the mouse in the
93:28 - i'm not getting paid a lot of money to
93:29 - do this for websites
93:31 - small amounts to make a little work
93:34 - about this but really there is this like
93:36 - implication that this cursor stands in
93:38 - for that leads into this whole network
93:40 - that ties to this mouse who's touching
93:42 - it what you're seeing and then where it
93:43 - directs you
93:44 - and then of course that like takes you
93:46 - back to what the uh the work is about
93:48 - and it just it did just make me think
93:49 - about it in a different way so so thank
93:52 - you
93:53 - i mean there's a there's a question of
93:54 - you know is
93:56 - the input that you're getting from the
93:58 - mouse that does that say something about
94:00 - the individual right um and if it does
94:03 - how deep does that say
94:05 - does that what does that say
94:07 - how deeply does that go um if one thinks
94:10 - about let's say anxiety right um i think
94:13 - there i read a paper in um behavioral
94:16 - and information
94:17 - behavioral informational technology that
94:19 - said
94:20 - uh this study where they tried to see if
94:23 - the um the clicks could
94:26 - if one could
94:27 - measure
94:28 - the anxiety of the individual via the
94:31 - clicks and they found that there was no
94:32 - correlation right but
94:36 - at what point does the mouse and the
94:38 - behavior of the mouse
94:40 - leave the body
94:42 - and move into let's say the screen right
94:47 - or into what
94:49 - mouse sees as opposed to what the
94:51 - individual
94:52 - um
94:54 - as opposed to the
94:56 - as opposed to
94:57 - it coming from the individual right
95:00 - right well this was this is the theme
95:02 - that came up over and over again in the
95:03 - conference was um the movement of the
95:05 - mouse is a kind of um divination
95:08 - and divination and biometrics are like
95:10 - two sides of the same coin
95:12 - um that's interesting it's definitely
95:15 - interesting to think about
95:17 - yeah camila and psy both mentioned
95:20 - divination as part of their talk and
95:23 - camilla kind of as like a
95:25 - surprise at the very end um talking
95:28 - about the mouse is a kind of like
95:29 - planchette something that will allow you
95:31 - to
95:32 - point to things to select things to have
95:35 - like power like to have agency in a
95:37 - particular kind of way like a divinish
95:39 - divination tool which
95:41 - was a was a surprise to us because we
95:43 - didn't we never prompted camilla to go
95:45 - in that direction and i don't think
95:46 - camila knew that psy's talk was entirely
95:48 - about the mouse and detonation but uh it
95:51 - was
95:52 - it was really interesting and i think
95:53 - has really shifted the way that i've
95:55 - thought about the mouse as well
95:57 - same i mean i think just just just
96:00 - thinking about it
96:01 - i like i really like this question at
96:03 - what point does the mouse leave the body
96:08 - i am speechless about it in fact
96:11 - i'm sorry go ahead
96:14 - i just wanted to bring something up from
96:16 - um last computer mouse conference on the
96:19 - panel we talked about
96:21 - uh the singularity right and i think
96:23 - this idea of this question of when the
96:25 - mouse leaves the body has been answered
96:28 - between then and now with um elon musk's
96:31 - um neuro neuro link right and what
96:34 - like is
96:36 - the
96:37 - the the mouse
96:39 - now not being a part of the not being
96:41 - digital
96:43 - fingerwise but now being cerebral
96:46 - um
96:48 - i don't know i think it just raises so
96:50 - many questions uh specifically about
96:53 - at what point does it leave the body or
96:56 - if it does leave the body in the new
96:58 - iterations of the mouth mouse of the
97:01 - mices that we're going to be seeing
97:03 - mouses is
97:06 - yeah
97:09 - yeah wait can you say more about like
97:11 - this cerebral um scary elon musk thing
97:14 - because i don't i feel like i shut down
97:16 - every time
97:19 - neurolink elon musk neuralink just um a
97:22 - few weeks ago demonstrated the
97:26 - they had a a monkey using a joystick to
97:29 - control
97:31 - something to get food
97:32 - they disconnected the joystick and the
97:35 - mouse and the the monkey was still
97:37 - moving the joystick but the signal was
97:39 - coming from the brain and then they
97:41 - finally just moved the joystick and now
97:43 - the
97:44 - the monkey is controlling the cursor on
97:47 - the screen with
97:49 - uh neural activity so it's sort of
97:51 - moving the
97:53 - the control of the mouse away from the
97:56 - digital
97:57 - right
97:58 - before it was connected to the computer
98:01 - physically then it was wireless and now
98:03 - it is
98:05 - brain
98:07 - control well that's really well first of
98:10 - all accurate in the reference to scary
98:13 - um but it's also really interesting
98:15 - because
98:16 - we have spent a ton of time this year
98:18 - talking about the necessity of touch and
98:21 - how
98:22 - it creates new
98:24 - layers of engagement because you have to
98:27 - engage because you have to touch this
98:29 - object and so thinking about some of the
98:32 - things that
98:33 - nabeel has discussed over the conference
98:35 - and and dorothy has discussed over this
98:38 - conference
98:39 - in comparison or in you know in
98:41 - juxtaposition to the story that you're
98:43 - telling i mean like it's it's a little
98:44 - bit it's a little bit spooky to see what
98:47 - could be lost in removing the sense of
98:49 - touch from uh that interaction
98:54 - i think maybe that's an argument for why
98:56 - people won't actually use those
98:58 - neural interfaces
99:00 - is because of the
99:02 - because of the tactileness of it
99:05 - um
99:06 - and also like the the
99:09 - the way that using a mouse is socially
99:11 - embedded
99:12 - um for better or for worse like another
99:14 - thing that i was thinking of with that
99:16 - discussion about gays is the fact that
99:18 - i am extremely attuned right now having
99:20 - been doing like
99:22 - teaching for many many
99:24 - dozens perhaps hundreds of hours over
99:27 - zoom over the course of the past year i
99:29 - know what you're doing based on what
99:30 - your face is doing on the screen right
99:32 - like i can tell if you're scrolling a
99:35 - web page i can tell if you're like
99:36 - typing something on your phone oh my
99:38 - gosh i
99:44 - and that's all based on like and part of
99:46 - the reason that i can do that is because
99:47 - if i'm moving my mouse around the screen
99:49 - like you can see what i'm doing with my
99:50 - gaze right
99:52 - and i can also you know you i can you
99:54 - can hear my mouse click when i'm
99:55 - clicking the mouse even even though
99:57 - we're not in the same place right so
100:00 - there's something
100:01 - it's it's a socially embedded thing as
100:03 - well
100:05 - that i think is desirable
100:07 - um
100:09 - and it would be
100:10 - i don't know
100:11 - it seems
100:12 - to me it seems uh for those reasons
100:15 - because it it gives us presence and it
100:17 - gives us this tactile feedback it seems
100:19 - unlikely that like it purely like like a
100:21 - brain interface pointing device would
100:23 - become popular it also seems kind of
100:26 - i don't know inconvenience messy
100:29 - potentially
100:33 - that sounds but i'm interested to hear
100:35 - what other people think on that on that
100:36 - issue i feel like we've had this promise
100:39 - of like neural interfaces for the past
100:40 - 30 years and they've never actually come
100:42 - to pass right that's that's i think um
100:44 - allison you're you're right except if
100:47 - you get a feedback
100:49 - from from right so what what does it
100:52 - mean to have a neural click
100:54 - how do you satisfy that that you know is
100:57 - it that and it this is all connected to
100:59 - like the more the motor um
101:02 - the motor cortex right so does
101:05 - does the click that comes back does that
101:08 - make you feel as if you have a click on
101:10 - your finger
101:11 - right right
101:12 - um or does it give you some sort of oh i
101:15 - don't even want to think this is
101:16 - horrible um give you like some sort of
101:19 - uh
101:20 - oxytocin release when you click
101:23 - nearly click a like
101:24 - in facebook
101:27 - i mean it already does right yeah
101:31 - yeah
101:32 - i um
101:34 - i just it's making me think of like you
101:37 - know the mouse's genesis and douglas
101:39 - engelbart and his whole the mouse
101:41 - inventors whole
101:42 - kind of thing was to have uh computers
101:47 - and humans in symbiosis it was kind of
101:49 - this like anti
101:51 - uh like autonomous ai move
101:53 - but
101:54 - now
101:55 - like this kind of neural click i think
101:57 - it's like the mouse the mouse is like
101:59 - the thing that's allowed us to even get
102:00 - there but now i'm wondering like
102:03 - you know
102:04 - uh i don't know like what if we had what
102:07 - if like the
102:09 - uh
102:10 - we were able to have like a neural
102:12 - interface a neural computing interface
102:15 - uh before personal like what if this was
102:17 - a possibility before personal personal
102:19 - computers were a possibility and would
102:22 - it even be a click like would it be this
102:24 - kind of way of pointing and clicking
102:26 - would it be something else more sensory
102:28 - i don't know it's it's strange to hold
102:30 - on to like the pointing and clicking in
102:32 - in
102:34 - without having to use
102:36 - like a screen or any kind of interface
102:38 - between you i think uh
102:40 - strange but i feel like this maybe is
102:41 - like doug engelberg's dream where like
102:43 - we're just in symbiosis with like
102:45 - you know
102:46 - in this like intellectual symbiosis with
102:48 - the world around us
102:51 - i don't know
102:52 - yeah
102:53 - well what you say does
102:55 - does remind me of the pattern that we
102:57 - just see over and over again which is
102:59 - the new thing that comes is defined in
103:01 - terms of what was there before
103:03 - and so this that click
103:05 - when you're like what well if this were
103:07 - reversed which is of course hard to even
103:09 - imagine and would mean playing this sort
103:11 - of mental tetris game so many things
103:13 - like at the highest level
103:15 - but
103:16 - the idea of the click not resonating in
103:17 - the way that it does
103:19 - that it does now is so just
103:24 - it's just hard it's hard to to even yeah
103:26 - to fathom you know
103:28 - i agree
103:31 - yeah and i think the the click
103:33 - uh and the way that the click resonates
103:36 - showed up in cesar's talk as like also
103:38 - tied to our nostalgia and i think the
103:40 - reason why we like care about it is
103:41 - because it originated at the time that
103:43 - it did so it's really it's hard to
103:45 - untangle ourselves from all of that to
103:47 - feel something different about it but
103:49 - it's definitely an
103:50 - interesting speculative activity
103:54 - i think that tied to all of this
103:56 - as well beyond the click is the the
103:59 - touch that initiates that click as well
104:01 - that feels like such a necessity
104:04 - as part of the sensory you know
104:06 - i think that uh
104:08 - there's you can see it in all of the
104:09 - designs
104:11 - of the mouses or mice over the last
104:14 - however many years that like they're
104:15 - designed in different ways we were
104:17 - holding a mouse just yesterday that was
104:18 - like this feels like a different kind of
104:20 - personal object
104:22 - and so i think that like there's there's
104:26 - so much about the touch that is also
104:27 - connected to why the click like those
104:30 - two things are really in tandem for a
104:31 - lot of computer users um
104:34 - in shannon madden's talk there was a
104:37 - rapid
104:38 - array of visuals of different computer
104:41 - mice and
104:42 - some of our culture hub collaborators
104:44 - were like that's the mouse i loved in
104:46 - like the early 2000s
104:48 - you know we only love the the love comes
104:50 - from also the experience of the touch
104:52 - that's also connected to the experience
104:53 - of the click because as david said the
104:55 - click is also a switch and different
104:58 - kinds of designs also emit a different
105:01 - kind of sound so it's it's so it's so
105:03 - tight to touch and so
105:05 - one of the things that
105:06 - uh emma and i were talking about was
105:09 - we've just we've just been so
105:11 - um
105:12 - excited about what nabeel was discussing
105:16 - when they were talking about touch
105:18 - nabil
105:19 - was referencing a an instagram bio that
105:22 - they have never been able to resurface
105:24 - but that they wholeheartedly agree with
105:26 - which is that all
105:27 - sensors are touch
105:29 - all senses are touch
105:31 - and nabil encouraged us in the talk
105:34 - to think through touch in a particular
105:36 - kind of way mainly
105:37 - that with every time we hear the click
105:39 - of the mouse we think about all the
105:41 - hands that the mouse was in before it
105:44 - got to our hands
105:45 - um which was really convenient because
105:48 - it tied into
105:49 - mindy
105:50 - sue and ali nas
105:52 - interview article i don't know if you
105:54 - wanted to read that yeah i read this
105:56 - quote yesterday but
105:58 - this is ali's
105:59 - quote
106:00 - they say using the computer mouse
106:02 - actually enhances your capacity to have
106:05 - touch
106:06 - and to touch space
106:07 - there were these ergonomic studies that
106:09 - show that the more you use the computer
106:11 - mouse the more your body is capable of
106:14 - sensing touch around it
106:16 - for me for ali this was this radical
106:19 - shift
106:22 - it's really connected to dorothy's work
106:24 - as well we're taking you on a journey
106:27 - through the conference and realizing
106:29 - we've been talking for like six minutes
106:30 - about everybody we like at the
106:32 - conference i think we i mean i think we
106:34 - are
106:36 - it there's something i think because we
106:38 - started with this question what does the
106:39 - mouse see
106:40 - which is so much in this like
106:42 - visual field this like non-touch
106:46 - kind of realm
106:47 - i think when people just kind of brought
106:49 - touch up into that question um it's
106:52 - something that we both really responded
106:54 - to and we think we were i mean our
106:57 - question is um
106:59 - and we're thinking about how we were
107:01 - taught
107:02 - technology like how we were taught to
107:03 - work with technical objects and how we
107:05 - were taught to make them and break them
107:07 - et cetera at itp
107:09 - other places
107:11 - and so we're wondering like how
107:14 - how would one create pedagogy
107:18 - that creates like more space to
107:20 - acknowledge like the importance of touch
107:23 - or like the the kind of ways in which
107:25 - touch is like very much embedded in
107:27 - these things which seemingly have not
107:29 - very much to do with touch yeah um even
107:32 - the object history dorothy talks about
107:34 - all the
107:35 - women particularly women who've been
107:38 - weavers in their black and brown
107:40 - indigenous communities who have touched
107:42 - circuits that have been embedded touched
107:44 - to design and build the circuits that
107:46 - have been embedded inside of our tech
107:48 - like how do we create space to
107:49 - acknowledge them how do we create space
107:51 - to like revere and appreciate that skill
107:53 - instead of like the or maybe just
107:56 - instead of is my is my bias but maybe
107:58 - alongside the doug engelbartz or
108:00 - alongside some of these other people who
108:02 - have been integral to technology
108:07 - out of our tech like how do we create
108:09 - space to acknowledge them how do we
108:10 - create space to like revere and
108:12 - appreciate that skill instead of like
108:14 - the or maybe just instead of is my is my
108:17 - bias but maybe alongside the doug
108:19 - engelbart's or alongside some of these
108:21 - other people who have been integral to
108:23 - technology
108:28 - secondary question is that a question
108:30 - well there's another there's another
108:31 - just like i think we wanted to like
108:33 - just
108:34 - touch on those things but also um
108:37 - i think uh we're wondering how much
108:40 - weight that each of you give in your
108:42 - practices to touch in the things that
108:45 - you make like it's touch something that
108:47 - is important to the things that you're
108:49 - that you're making and that you're
108:50 - putting out into the world
108:52 - but also because you all teach so also
108:54 - just from a pedagogical standpoint also
108:56 - if touch
108:57 - uh is important in specifically in
109:00 - teaching in like a tech in a tech space
109:03 - i think where like it's not i mean yeah
109:06 - i think it depends on what kinds of tech
109:07 - spaces you're in but
109:10 - [Music]
109:14 - you know
109:15 - as an opening to maybe a response
109:17 - because we have taken you on a journey
109:20 - you know io
109:21 - for instance you spend so much time
109:24 - connecting with
109:25 - communities that have both in a real
109:29 - time historical sense and in a
109:32 - fictitious
109:34 - speculative sense thinking about how
109:36 - people
109:37 - have designed usually people of color
109:39 - have designed technology and i wonder if
109:41 - you're could you imagine how we might
109:44 - create more pedagogical space to hold
109:46 - them at the center of our tech education
109:49 - like how could we hold them in the in
109:51 - the center of that
109:53 - yeah
109:54 - absolutely i mean i
109:56 - i think back to a student that i had at
109:59 - parsons that talked about
110:02 - the fact that his grandmother would say
110:05 - that she was
110:12 - native um
110:15 - indigenous
110:16 - native american right and he said
110:19 - in his thesis talk that that was not
110:21 - true
110:22 - and i countered and i said wait what do
110:24 - you mean that was not true
110:27 - it was true for her she needed to
110:30 - construct that story right and to to to
110:32 - be able to survive and you know this is
110:35 - also about this about um hardness um
110:39 - critical tabulation right and the the
110:41 - construction of these
110:43 - these identities these speculative
110:45 - spaces um that allow for
110:48 - that allow for survive survival so
110:50 - thinking on that
110:52 - in relation to the mouse you know if we
110:54 - say that
110:56 - there is this history of oppression
110:59 - that's attached to it
111:01 - um how do we
111:04 - create new spaces
111:06 - um how do we how how can we create new
111:09 - spaces to rethink that and then i think
111:11 - what's really key there is then how do
111:14 - we make those real spaces real so how do
111:16 - we make
111:17 - mice
111:18 - mouses is
111:19 - that let's say
111:21 - when they scroll against a video of um
111:25 - of a black body actually being extra
111:27 - judicially killed will not
111:29 - uh
111:31 - excuse me i'm on on the call here
111:33 - um that will not um allow you to
111:37 - you know play the video
111:39 - or that will
111:40 - twist
111:41 - that twist
111:43 - or re or
111:44 - supposed reality into that fabulation
111:49 - and i think for for that you know it's
111:52 - touch is absolutely important i'm
111:54 - thinking about teaching over the
111:56 - pandemic and actually not being able to
111:58 - demonstrate to students you know this is
112:00 - how you connect wires together here take
112:03 - the battery stick it on your tongue this
112:05 - is you know what it feels like
112:07 - i think
112:08 - physicality being in proximity um and
112:11 - touching is absolutely critical
112:14 - yeah
112:17 - yeah well i wasn't expecting
112:20 - this
112:21 - hypothetical mouse that you're
112:22 - describing i wasn't expecting uh
112:24 - the idea that like a mouse could avoid
112:27 - certain actions or could
112:29 - um
112:30 - change our reality as you're describing
112:32 - i think it's really really interesting
112:34 - and i guess also just like helps me sort
112:36 - of sort of think about how we how when
112:38 - we say how do we create space in
112:40 - pedagogy it can it can be in lots of
112:43 - different ways and outside of the
112:44 - classroom and in terms of technological
112:46 - design as well
112:50 - alison how much weight do you give touch
112:54 - in your practice
112:56 - i think it would we were really curious
112:57 - as a person who works in like tech and
112:59 - poetics
113:02 - um
113:04 - i don't know it's a super interesting
113:05 - question
113:06 - i
113:12 - let me think about it for a second
113:16 - i think i think that
113:18 - there
113:20 - there's like a really easy way to turn
113:23 - that question into because when you
113:25 - think about
113:27 - um language and touch primarily what i
113:29 - do is i work with language you start
113:31 - thinking about physical materials right
113:34 - like the
113:35 - the paper and the ink on the paper and
113:37 - things like that
113:39 - um and i think
113:41 - that's something that i've been trying
113:42 - to emphasize in my own work recently is
113:44 - thinking about thinking about physical
113:46 - material and thinking about how how the
113:48 - material substrate of of writing is
113:51 - something that you know can be a part of
113:54 - the piece even if you are working with
113:56 - computation which otherwise tries to
113:58 - abstract language in various ways but i
114:02 - i want to i i'm
114:04 - i don't want to limit that idea of touch
114:07 - just to like that physical dimension of
114:09 - it even though that i feel like that's
114:10 - where we're going to be drawn
114:11 - automatically
114:12 - even though i don't know what else i'm
114:13 - going to say counts as touch in that
114:16 - in that area
114:17 - i think um what i try to do in my own
114:20 - practice in my teaching is trying to
114:21 - bring out embodiedness
114:24 - um
114:24 - and that's not the same thing as touch
114:27 - but um
114:29 - always making sure to emphasize with
114:31 - linguistic artifacts and especially
114:33 - digital linguistic artifacts that they
114:35 - they come from the body they come from
114:37 - speech acts that have been recorded
114:39 - turned into data um whether those are
114:41 - speech acts from like somebody talking
114:42 - or speech from somebody typing or speech
114:45 - from somebody like using their phone or
114:47 - maybe using their mouse to type i don't
114:49 - know of anybody that does that but it's
114:50 - certainly possible
114:52 - um
114:53 - and that we make it physical when it
114:56 - comes out of the computer so emphasizing
114:58 - like both parts of that and how the
115:00 - output depends on the physical output
115:02 - depends on the physical input um
115:05 - and that's sort of like i feel like
115:06 - that's like sort of a super set of of
115:08 - touch
115:10 - um
115:12 - but i think that's the best that's the
115:14 - best answer that i have for that from a
115:16 - pedagogical standpoint i think um
115:19 - the
115:21 - it's really an uphill battle to make
115:23 - students care about that issue because i
115:26 - don't think we're we're not just talking
115:28 - about like tactileness here if we can if
115:30 - we can usefully separate these two
115:32 - categories like something that involves
115:34 - feeling and something that involves
115:36 - touch which i think we're talking about
115:37 - in like a more specific way isn't like
115:40 - uh uh an encounter with the actual
115:43 - material the material of the world and
115:45 - not just like
115:47 - the thing that's predetermined by the
115:48 - abstraction of the system that we're
115:50 - talking about
115:51 - i think that um where the glitz is and
115:55 - where the money is in technology right
115:57 - now is in those systems that abstract
115:59 - away
116:00 - the material history of the
116:03 - of of the artifacts that we're using
116:06 - right um
116:08 - to make them replaceable so that we have
116:10 - an infrastructure where you know you
116:12 - upgrade to the next thing and everything
116:13 - works seamlessly and and things like
116:15 - that
116:16 - um
116:17 - so that's that i think is like really
116:19 - the difficult thing to do in pedagogy is
116:20 - to say like i know you're super into
116:23 - this
116:25 - new machine learning model that came out
116:27 - um but we need to think about
116:30 - how that actually came into existence
116:32 - like we can't just use it as it is
116:35 - yeah um
116:37 - so getting students to sort of like
116:39 - understand that
116:41 - the thing that has all of this like
116:43 - shininess to it
116:45 - um
116:45 - [Music]
116:47 - uh may need to be further uh
116:50 - investigated and not even to like a
116:52 - critical like i'm not saying that every
116:53 - single uh interactive art piece needs to
116:56 - be a critical interactive art piece
116:58 - um
116:59 - but just getting students to consider
117:00 - that extra step is is kind of a struggle
117:03 - fortunately i've had students like you
117:05 - who didn't need to be controlled to
117:07 - cajole to you to do that
117:09 - um
117:11 - yeah
117:12 - yeah mimi what do you what do you think
117:14 - about that
117:16 - actually i have so many thoughts i'm
117:18 - trying to put them in order i've been
117:19 - trying to put them in order this whole
117:20 - time and then they get more jumbled as i
117:21 - listen listen to the other two talk um
117:25 - maybe i'll start first with the first
117:27 - that original question
117:29 - that y'all you would ask when the two of
117:30 - you were going back and forth in this
117:32 - lovely way when you said how you the two
117:35 - of you said you're thinking about touch
117:36 - and thinking about the way you've been
117:37 - taught technology and how do we create
117:39 - space for that yeah and i think
117:42 - that the answer to that is kind of
117:44 - simple and very complicated and the
117:46 - simple part is we just do
117:48 - and the complicated part is to do that
117:51 - in a way that doesn't
117:53 - rely upon
117:56 - the tools that we already have or the
117:57 - particular ways in which we know to
117:59 - create space for things
118:02 - um i'm gonna try to make that make sense
118:04 - i think that in some like i think you
118:07 - know so much of what we've inherited
118:10 - in a lot of the spaces that we are in
118:12 - and especially the university as
118:14 - an institutions machine as
118:17 - complicit and involved and so in the
118:19 - maintenance of so much
118:21 - is of course site is foregrounded and
118:23 - sight is very much about legibility
118:26 - and
118:27 - i i guess the thing i'm trying to
118:30 - or to figure out how to articulate is
118:32 - that in
118:33 - making room for other senses and also
118:36 - putting them
118:37 - not just senses other ways of knowing
118:40 - because i think that's really what we're
118:41 - talking about yeah that might also
118:43 - demand
118:45 - not having them be
118:47 - it doesn't it's not like touch but make
118:48 - it visible
118:49 - show me how we're doing touch in the
118:51 - same way i don't think i think it means
118:53 - coming at this from a completely
118:55 - different point
118:56 - and
118:57 - really thinking well what are other ways
118:59 - of knowing and maybe it's not in the
119:01 - same tradition
119:03 - that we've inherited in the classroom
119:05 - maybe this is something else and maybe
119:07 - it means
119:09 - thinking like also push pulling away
119:11 - from some of the
119:13 - the hierarchies for what we think of as
119:15 - something being uh foregrounded or
119:17 - centered which is like it's on a
119:18 - syllabus and you know we talk about it
119:20 - in a class maybe that means a different
119:22 - way of approaching things entirely which
119:24 - i realize is a kind of is a i know it's
119:27 - a slippery thing
119:28 - um a slippery thing to hold
119:31 - but i think i also feel this way because
119:34 - i i also really enjoyed uh nibile's a
119:36 - talk i loved what they were as oft as as
119:39 - always i loved what they were saying
119:41 - and
119:42 - i
119:43 - and i but then i also was like oh i'm
119:44 - not really ready to i still you know
119:46 - we're jumping to touch i'm still here
119:47 - thinking about sound too i think there's
119:49 - something so immediate about sound and
119:51 - this click and
119:53 - what
119:54 - you know with sound it's sound is about
119:56 - this temporality something you often it
119:59 - suggests the kind of like
120:01 - embeddedness and
120:03 - connectedness
120:04 - as well and so that's not to say oh this
120:06 - is more important but maybe part of what
120:09 - we're talking about is a kind of
120:10 - fluidity of being able to switch between
120:12 - different ways of knowing and be okay
120:14 - with that
120:16 - depending on what it is that we are
120:17 - trying to know and how and who with
120:19 - because i do think also a lot of this is
120:21 - connected to
120:22 - when i think of touch i think of all of
120:23 - these i'm we're thinking of a kind of
120:25 - relationality and relationships and
120:27 - connectedness um or at least that's what
120:29 - i am thinking
120:30 - yeah
120:31 - i think like one one very
120:35 - very simple and i'm not sure if it's
120:36 - effective uh way to to do this is
120:41 - when i'm teaching to try to break as
120:42 - much as possible the the myth that the
120:45 - computational abstraction is
120:48 - actually encompasses the the phenomena
120:50 - that it claims to encompass
120:53 - um and that's like the whole history of
120:55 - computation has that idea that
120:56 - eventually like everything will come
120:58 - underneath computational control
121:00 - everything will be part of a
121:02 - computational
121:03 - ontology that we will eventually be able
121:05 - to understand the entire world as a
121:06 - sequence of zeros and ones and
121:09 - like at a very basic level like just
121:10 - saying to students like no that isn't
121:12 - the case every computer program every
121:14 - computational interface is is a take on
121:16 - that it's somebody's opinion about it
121:18 - that they've turned into a system in
121:20 - order to express that opinion or you
121:24 - know turn that opinion into something
121:26 - that controls other people
121:27 - um
121:28 - so just just trying to point that out
121:30 - like
121:31 - every single time
121:33 - very insistently that like even though
121:35 - the person who made this maybe claims
121:37 - that this tells us everything about
121:40 - motion movement language in my case or
121:42 - whatever it's actually just like one
121:44 - potential take on that that has its own
121:47 - thank
121:48 - you
121:50 - do you
121:51 - are we allowed to ask questions too
121:53 - [Laughter]
121:55 - how does that how does does that work do
121:57 - you find
121:58 - i say i don't know what that means for
121:59 - that to work but well yeah exactly like
122:02 - i mean have i done like a user study in
122:05 - a survey and like use cases and
122:08 - have i subjected it to design
122:09 - methodology
122:11 - so yeah i don't know if it works i mean
122:13 - it feels good so
122:22 - um i say that because i think what
122:24 - you're saying is for me just one of i
122:26 - think the best strategies is this taking
122:29 - something and saying actually this is
122:30 - not the one way this is a way
122:33 - which means that there are other ways
122:36 - and that you know usually that it's like
122:38 - a practice i think for me i think now
122:40 - i'm thinking in the classroom and
122:41 - thinking about it uh pedagogically that
122:43 - that is a practice of undoing for me and
122:46 - for like the students that we're often
122:48 - doing together
122:50 - right
122:50 - but i think also it's the that there are
122:53 - other ways but those other ways are also
122:55 - intertwined with the way
122:58 - right with this with any particular way
123:01 - i i'm thinking also about this you know
123:03 - we've been talking a lot about click
123:05 - about touch about sound as if they're as
123:08 - if they're different right um when it's
123:11 - a click right it's not just a click
123:14 - right it's also the sound it's also
123:16 - where you are at that time there's all
123:18 - of the all these senses are or
123:21 - are wrapped into um into one so
123:24 - it might be
123:26 - a sort of
123:27 - understanding of
123:29 - the totality of the senses
123:31 - at
123:32 - i'm going to say at those particular
123:35 - times or at those particular moments and
123:37 - maybe
123:39 - i don't know maybe trying to suss
123:40 - something out through that
123:42 - right
123:43 - right
123:44 - yeah i think that i mean
123:46 - i
123:47 - i think i agree like when we're talking
123:49 - about touch that it is we're also just
123:51 - talking about different ways of knowing
123:53 - um
123:54 - and it makes me think like yeah can we
123:57 - i also had this thought like do we just
123:59 - need to like yeah suss out
124:02 - more
124:03 - this idea that like maybe the mouse is
124:06 - like what we're doing in our hand is
124:08 - different from what we're doing with our
124:09 - eyes and that like that whatever's
124:12 - happening there in like the touch
124:14 - phenomena space
124:16 - um
124:17 - you know like that we
124:19 - could just privilege that or privileged
124:21 - sound like just privilege these things
124:24 - more than we do and that that might tell
124:27 - us something new about like
124:29 - how we think or how we come to know that
124:32 - like how we where intelligence actually
124:34 - is like it's not necessarily just in
124:36 - like your like it's in your body you
124:39 - know it's it's it's it's outside your
124:41 - body also too
124:43 - so right yeah
124:45 - yeah we've been thinking about how
124:46 - different
124:48 - computational devices
124:50 - also satisfy different kinds of senses
124:52 - like the same way that maybe like a
124:54 - joystick might satisfy a different kind
124:57 - of like arm and hand
124:59 - sensory experience than like a mouse
125:01 - would
125:02 - um and a keyboard as well in different
125:04 - ways
125:06 - we have a con we have like a risky
125:07 - question
125:09 - um not risking a nefarious way risky in
125:12 - terms of like what we have built
125:15 - but could this conference be about any
125:17 - other object like do you think that this
125:20 - could be about a different thing than
125:21 - the computer mouse
125:23 - like all of what we were talking about
125:24 - could we be just scooping it and talking
125:27 - about it on top of a completely
125:28 - different object keyboard
125:31 - like the keyboard that's a bad example
125:33 - but like i feel like you know yeah any
125:35 - other kind of technical object yeah are
125:37 - y'all trying to pivot are you trying to
125:38 - get ideas from us
125:41 - we're trying to crowdsource ideas we're
125:42 - like
125:44 - when we were talking about this earlier
125:45 - we're like oh gosh like should we ask
125:47 - this question i hope people aren't going
125:48 - to be like when's the joystick
125:49 - conference when's the
125:52 - yeah i'm putting together the joystick
125:55 - conference next year i'll have it on the
125:57 - same day as a mouse conference
126:06 - no i'm not going to do that um
126:08 - i like that question because i i think
126:11 - about it in terms of what i would tell
126:13 - my students
126:15 - right um
126:18 - there's so much in the in the computer
126:20 - mouse and i almost feel like say
126:23 - it should just go deeper and deeper and
126:24 - deeper right um
126:26 - [Music]
126:28 - there's something so wonderful about
126:31 - everybody that that um
126:33 - that spoke um what presented
126:35 - just new information
126:37 - um
126:39 - and i wonder how how
126:40 - how how much information is in is in
126:44 - this
126:44 - um
126:47 - i'm eager to find out i don't know
126:54 - i think i'll go because i keep stealing
126:56 - the coveted last spot um i think i think
127:00 - for me the answer is yeah it could be
127:04 - but that doesn't make this any less
127:06 - it doesn't make this any less important
127:08 - and useful though i think it could be in
127:10 - that way of just the beauty of focusing
127:14 - on something and then doing that allows
127:16 - you to see so much more and then it
127:17 - shows you all these different
127:18 - relationships and connections and that
127:20 - in itself is a really
127:22 - wonderful act and practice that i think
127:24 - the two of you
127:25 - along with this community that you've
127:26 - assembled have been demonstrating over
127:28 - the years
127:29 - so i yeah yes and that's not a bad thing
127:34 - yeah i think i mean
127:36 - it's i think that's sort of like asking
127:38 - like could this reading be about a
127:39 - different tarot card right
127:42 - um
127:43 - and so like like maybe said yes like you
127:45 - know if we if we drew the
127:47 - the seven of pentacles instead of the
127:49 - ace of swords or whatever the reading
127:51 - would be different but the methodology
127:53 - that you would bring to that reading
127:54 - would be would be substantively the same
127:57 - right
127:58 - um i think i think the facts um that
128:01 - that you're enthusiastic about the
128:02 - conference or about the topic about the
128:04 - mouse as an object like he gives an
128:07 - engine to this this conference that it's
128:10 - actually really difficult to find an
128:12 - engine that can drive
128:14 - organizing and events and getting people
128:16 - to to come together around it so that's
128:18 - that's pretty remarkable
128:20 - um and just being able to like you know
128:22 - talk to shannon matcher and say like you
128:24 - know just pull a random card out of the
128:27 - deck and say like here's the topic of
128:28 - your talk and then have shout out to
128:30 - matcher and do it that's like that's
128:32 - kind of a superpower right um
128:35 - so i i think i agree with mimi like yeah
128:37 - you could do it on a different topic but
128:39 - but there's something about the
128:40 - confluence of interest and and personnel
128:44 - and
128:44 - also this object that you're talking
128:46 - about computer mouse which has so many
128:48 - interesting affordances when we're
128:49 - talking about
128:51 - researching it um and thinking about it
128:54 - and and using it and clicking with it
128:58 - that i think kind of makes it a unique
129:00 - confluence it's such a great constraint
129:04 - it's it's a beautiful constraint and you
129:07 - know like that is what drives really
129:11 - really good design it's like you have a
129:13 - constraint you just have to work within
129:15 - it i think sort of thinking about what
129:18 - sort of iterations right um so for
129:20 - example if one year the conference is
129:23 - about
129:24 - making
129:25 - um computer
129:27 - mice mouses mouse mouse yeah um that
129:32 - could be
129:34 - i'm going to continue that that could be
129:35 - like
129:36 - right
129:38 - yeah it reminds me of the um
129:41 - the
129:42 - like 10 years ago
129:44 - uh rhizome did a conference about
129:46 - e-cigarettes
129:48 - was anybody there for that
129:50 - i would just like sound like
129:52 - sound off in the chat if you were there
129:55 - and i i for a very long time just
129:57 - thought that was completely ridiculous
129:59 - that was just like
130:01 - just like the height of like um
130:03 - doing something super like trendy in
130:06 - order to gain interest around it um now
130:08 - i'm like bad knocking people i don't
130:10 - even know who i'm about
130:12 - but now i can
130:20 - like that it's okay to sit one out right
130:23 - like even though this was like an
130:25 - important event at rhizome it was like
130:27 - it was fine for me not to care about
130:28 - e-cigarettes and incorporate them into
130:30 - my practice
130:32 - um
130:33 - but i think what this conference is
130:34 - showing me is that like actually you can
130:36 - gather people together around a topic
130:38 - that maybe doesn't have this you know
130:41 - this immediate
130:42 - like um
130:44 - isn't isn't obviously urgent right
130:47 - um but then like actually show how it is
130:49 - urgent and how people how paying
130:51 - attention to that thing can can actually
130:54 - give
130:54 - can be valuable and and fun and
130:56 - interesting
130:57 - and what do you what do you two think
131:00 - yeah and he's out here really asking all
131:03 - the questions
131:05 - we shouldn't have we shouldn't have let
131:07 - her ask ask that question about asking
131:09 - questions it's really making me miss
131:11 - being um in class with both you allison
131:14 - and mimi um because it's just a familiar
131:18 - dynamic uh um
131:21 - but yeah i think
131:23 - i mean
131:24 - like the computer mouse now through
131:27 - doing this conference
131:29 - i think it's become this like
131:31 - like now it's like this this this like
131:33 - meta subject for me which which yeah has
131:36 - to do with like what it means to study
131:38 - something through through a limit
131:40 - through such a limited
131:43 - object
131:44 - and so i'm curious i mean i am curious
131:46 - like what
131:48 - um
131:49 - what are like the meta things that can
131:51 - be pulled out from this conference that
131:52 - might not be true in a conference about
131:54 - a joystick like what are the things that
131:57 - are unique to the mouse in its limits
132:00 - like it's not just that it's a limited
132:02 - small object i think that there is
132:04 - there are some like um
132:07 - unique limits that i can't name right
132:10 - now but i think if i were to like study
132:12 - back on this conference and all the
132:14 - content and the conversation that's come
132:15 - out of it
132:17 - um that
132:18 - that
132:20 - i don't know it would say something new
132:22 - about the mouse that i haven't been able
132:23 - to say yet
132:24 - um
132:26 - yeah and also i mean we've talked about
132:28 - like
132:30 - you know we we did this conference for
132:31 - the first time last year while we were
132:33 - in grad school
132:35 - and we've talked about running a class
132:38 - like that there's just like confidence
132:40 - as class like hey you have an idea like
132:42 - you can do a conference and it's
132:44 - actually a really kind of like amazing
132:46 - way to stretch your research like it's a
132:47 - really
132:48 - amazing way to like think differently
132:51 - about what you think about all the time
132:52 - and to get other people
132:55 - uh to think with you and it's kind of
132:57 - like a vulnerable act um yeah
132:59 - it's definitely vulnerable because i
133:01 - mean
133:02 - shout out to the poor person who created
133:05 - the e-cigarettes conference i mean
133:06 - people could really just pull you into
133:08 - pieces right and say like this is the
133:10 - conference is amazing
133:12 - it might be like the most important
133:14 - intellectual events of the century for
133:18 - all i know
133:20 - definitely not i mean there's probably
133:21 - there's probably probably shouldn't have
133:22 - even said that thing about i mean
133:24 - there's definitely allison's out there
133:25 - thinking that about this conference
133:26 - there have to be sure
133:28 - like 10
133:37 - what a joystick conference
133:40 - or a trackpad conference
133:42 - would mean might that elucidate
133:46 - um the distinction with the mouse
133:51 - right
133:52 - what what what uh what sort of regimes
133:56 - um
133:57 - uh are there within a trackpad or joist
134:01 - i mean the joystick definitely right
134:03 - like militaristic blah blah blah right
134:05 - but how does that distinguish itself
134:07 - from the mouse right that might be a
134:09 - good way to start thinking about yeah
134:11 - that's super cool
134:13 - and and also i don't know
134:15 - where
134:16 - if you all have done sort of looking at
134:19 - the production of mice right and sort of
134:22 - looking at the
134:24 - manu like going into the into the
134:27 - manufacturing um bring in people that
134:29 - actually make
134:31 - um the companies that make it um
134:34 - mice
134:35 - um come to the conference and maybe
134:38 - maybe there's something there as well
134:39 - right totally yeah well for me in terms
134:42 - of this question
134:44 - you know i i think about this question a
134:46 - lot because emma and i we kind of it's
134:48 - like almost like a long-standing joke in
134:50 - a way and a long-standing like serious
134:52 - question in a way but
134:54 - you know yesterday we talked about the
134:56 - origin of this conference and a
134:58 - conversation that happened
134:59 - um in our grad program where um you know
135:02 - emma had just presented some research
135:03 - and i like went over to her in an
135:05 - attempt to make friends as well and to
135:07 - say like you know this could be a whole
135:08 - conference this could be a whole
135:09 - conference on the mass and the initial
135:11 - idea was that we had
135:14 - version one was that everybody at this
135:16 - conference would make their own mouse
135:18 - just as you said io that the initial
135:20 - idea was that cool we'll bring everybody
135:22 - together you make your mouse from the
135:23 - positionality of like what it means to
135:25 - you to hold this object and what holding
135:27 - an object
135:28 - signifies for your own
135:30 - for your own discipline or your own
135:32 - creative practice or your own life and i
135:34 - think you know thinking about that in
135:35 - relationship to like psy's
135:37 - physical object for
135:40 - uh divination is really exciting because
135:42 - that's
135:43 - i imagine what we what what could have
135:45 - manifested if the converse if the
135:47 - conference was all about like creating
135:49 - one mouse
135:50 - per person i think that uh
135:54 - for me
135:55 - it's been really exciting
135:57 - to
135:58 - have the
136:00 - things that i care about outside of this
136:03 - show up inside of this so all of the
136:06 - things that i care about in my in my
136:09 - practice broadly around like racism and
136:12 - like dismantling systems of oppression
136:13 - through technology in terms of like
136:15 - acknowledging like black and brown and
136:17 - indigenous women who are like unsung
136:20 - heroes and unsung like the unsung
136:23 - oppressed demographics of some of this
136:25 - technology i've been really shocked and
136:27 - excited to see that content show up in
136:30 - this conference because when i when we
136:32 - started this
136:33 - i wasn't imagining that it would be so
136:36 - so often that that talks would emerge
136:39 - both last year and this year that talk
136:40 - about like the politics of labor that
136:43 - talk about like the politics of like
136:44 - gender and race
136:46 - um
136:47 - and
136:48 - uh the politics of the body so
136:52 - i wonder what that would look like in
136:53 - another object but i am also just like
136:56 - so convinced now that those things that
136:58 - everything is interconnected and
136:59 - everything is embedded inside of
137:00 - everything and that the mouse
137:03 - has been like an incredible conduit to
137:05 - just doubling down on all of that
137:07 - research that exists mouseless in the
137:09 - rest of my practice you know
137:16 - yeah
137:17 - i mean so charlton charlton i think like
137:20 - he says uh the mouse is fundamentally
137:22 - relational and i don't know just the way
137:24 - that he said it with such uh
137:29 - i don't know eviction yeah i i i think
137:32 - that is the thing that allows for this
137:34 - conference to happen in the way that it
137:36 - does i mean i i don't think that a
137:38 - joystick conference would be quite like
137:40 - this
137:41 - um it wouldn't be quite as generative i
137:43 - don't know maybe i have no idea
137:47 - one maybe one limitation on the mouse
137:50 - conference is that there is
137:51 - and this came up in the in the chat box
137:53 - chat there's the the frison of
137:56 - nostalgia
137:58 - like
137:58 - shooting through it yeah so i don't know
138:00 - if like 10 years or 20 years from now
138:03 - when
138:04 - when the people who would be organizing
138:05 - a conference like this may never have
138:07 - actually held and that was right right
138:10 - um they wouldn't have that same
138:12 - connection to it
138:13 - right
138:14 - right also by my suggestion for next
138:17 - year would be like
138:18 - mouse mouse conference but you can't
138:22 - mention douglas engelbart i love that
138:25 - just completely forbidden you can't
138:27 - share the image of like the first mouse
138:28 - with like the two little gear heads that
138:30 - move perpendicular to each other yes
138:32 - like off off limits i've been i've been
138:34 - um trying to i like i've been joking
138:37 - that i'm kind of like a doug engelbert
138:39 - look like she's dressed she's dressed as
138:41 - him today
138:46 - just yeah just just repeat replace every
138:49 - mention of duggan will part with emma
138:52 - and it's all good um
138:54 - yeah i think you know we're we're like
138:56 - 10 minutes from the end the the stream
138:59 - is five minutes behind us so this
139:02 - request might come in five minutes from
139:04 - now
139:04 - but
139:05 - if you have questions for our panelists
139:08 - the chat is chaotic it is very exciting
139:11 - but it's also hard to sift questions
139:14 - from it because everyone is responding
139:16 - to each other's questions so maybe if
139:17 - you could write question at the header
139:20 - of your of your line and then write that
139:22 - question afterwards we can ask that
139:23 - question to the panelists
139:25 - um
139:26 - but uh yeah so if you have a question
139:28 - please drop it in the chat and we'll
139:29 - we'll uh make sure that we get we'll try
139:32 - our best to get to it um and i think you
139:34 - know in in the meantime
139:37 - uh we wanted to just sort of kind of
139:39 - land in our portion of this
139:42 - on the topic of fundamental fundamental
139:44 - relationality
139:46 - um and really you know going back to
139:48 - charlton we've quoted this so many times
139:49 - over the course of the conference but um
139:52 - charlton talks about how
139:54 - the mouse also forces us to take stock
139:56 - of what we see and how we see it
139:58 - um david uh bearing porter's call to
140:01 - action
140:02 - is to become more aware of the kind of
140:04 - multiplied meaning of clicking
140:06 - and the kind of currency that it has
140:08 - within surveillance capitalism for
140:10 - instance and so we were hoping that
140:12 - maybe
140:13 - you could comment a little bit on how we
140:16 - might create a new practice of
140:17 - intentionality knowing all of this how
140:19 - do we create a new practice of
140:20 - intentionality with with the operation
140:22 - of the mouse and clicks or is that even
140:24 - possible
140:25 - so we'll sort of like send that question
140:27 - over to the panelists now and then again
140:30 - like if you have questions drop them
140:31 - into the chat clearly and we will try to
140:34 - also pose this to the panelists too
140:42 - i'm searching for questions in the
140:44 - meantime yeah
140:46 - so
140:48 - what how could we create a practice of
140:50 - intentionality around how we click or is
140:52 - it possible
140:54 - alison you're smirking a lot i don't
140:56 - know if you've got an incredible answer
140:58 - you like really look like you've got
141:00 - something smart
141:01 - i think i think i've got the the 90
141:04 - minutes into the panel uh whoopsie
141:06 - doozies
141:08 - uh
141:11 - and i'm trying to think of an answer to
141:12 - that and i can't i can't come up with
141:15 - with anything i think i mean
141:18 - so one thing that i do is i don't do any
141:21 - kind of metrics tracking on my websites
141:24 - at all i don't include google analytics
141:26 - um i have no idea who's visiting my
141:28 - websites
141:30 - i'm not interested in your mouse
141:31 - movements i don't know how far down you
141:33 - scrolled anything like that um
141:36 - i could probably benefit from having
141:38 - that information um
141:41 - but i don't i don't capture it because i
141:42 - don't think that that's any of my
141:44 - business
141:45 - um and that's something that's really
141:47 - small but maybe it counts i don't know
141:52 - i like this question um
141:56 - i mean it's kind of related to what we
141:57 - were saying like how long
141:59 - until the mouse
142:00 - is a pointing icon like the floppy disk
142:03 - has been forgotten and renamed
142:06 - like how long it wait maybe i'm reading
142:08 - this wrong
142:10 - um
142:13 - i think i mean i'm reading the question
142:15 - as like how long until like the pointing
142:17 - icon i think how long until like
142:18 - obsolesces like when is the mouse going
142:20 - to
142:21 - become obsolete like it seems to like
142:25 - i think for a while i thought it was
142:26 - like this forgotten device and it was
142:28 - already on its way out but it seems to
142:30 - really still be here
142:31 - it's really like a main kind of tool for
142:34 - a lot of people who do like heavy work
142:35 - on their computer
142:37 - um
142:41 - i have one that i use i've been using it
142:43 - this whole time
142:48 - it's wired and everything it's wired wow
142:51 - that's great yeah
142:53 - uh i have go ahead i know three
142:56 - three three
142:58 - three three three of them right here wow
143:02 - i don't know why
143:03 - [Laughter]
143:06 - um i guess since we're doing this
143:08 - one
143:09 - one really old school i'm like
143:11 - embarrassed to even
143:13 - even
143:14 - have a ball
143:16 - yeah
143:21 - listen i didn't expect to be asked to
143:23 - show this i was like no one has to know
143:26 - actually my um my track pad broke and
143:29 - then i went back to my my old school
143:31 - mouse and i serving me well
143:33 - um
143:34 - i can i take a stab yeah
143:37 - at the question that you had asked
143:39 - which was about intentionality in
143:41 - relation to the mouse
143:43 - and
143:44 - i think that there are some there are
143:46 - some really clear questions clear
143:48 - answers
143:50 - like allison actually gave one that was
143:51 - really nice and really direct and
143:53 - there's we can talk about e-waste and
143:55 - talk about um
143:57 - oh that is trippy to see myself
144:00 - with double meanings wow i'm seeing
144:03 - myself playing
144:04 - ah
144:05 - this is awful
144:07 - wow okay
144:09 - i'm going to try it out
144:11 - it's very it's very mysterious because
144:13 - we just see one mimi so you're seeing
144:15 - into some other digital world than we're
144:17 - seeing
144:18 - [Laughter]
144:20 - wow yeah there we go now it's better no
144:22 - it's better um
144:24 - well i was gonna say there are some
144:25 - answers to that question around this
144:27 - this how do we have a more intentional
144:29 - um
144:30 - kind of i don't know
144:31 - whatever with the mouse along the lines
144:33 - of um
144:36 - what
144:37 - who david and charlton were both saying
144:39 - and in their talks yesterday i think or
144:42 - to i can't remember i don't know um
144:44 - and yeah i feel like there's a part of
144:45 - this that is about the mouse
144:46 - specifically where it's like oh what
144:48 - allison had said already around clicks
144:50 - and surveillance and tracking and
144:52 - there's also thing i think of e-waste
144:54 - and just this kind of question of oh my
144:56 - gosh just the turning over of equipment
144:59 - and that lifeline and what that looks
145:00 - like and where they come from so on
145:02 - there's so many questions there but i
145:03 - also think that the question you're
145:05 - asking is great because it
145:07 - is as much about the mouse as it is
145:09 - about everything else that has to do
145:11 - with the mouse and so
145:13 - that question of intentionality
145:16 - to me you know we're talking about
145:17 - relationality but relation up
145:19 - the mouse is a relational object but
145:22 - even within relationship it's
145:24 - how do i say this oh my gosh y'all i j
145:26 - i'm telling you the shot i'm like
145:28 - affected i just got this second vaccine
145:30 - shot today everyone knows um that's what
145:32 - i'm talking about not like uh not like
145:34 - not like a shot that i took
145:36 - oh okay relationality within
145:38 - relationality
145:40 - i think also that you need to speak
145:43 - about hierarchy because
145:45 - hierarchy is a form of relation of of
145:47 - relationships and
145:50 - part of
145:50 - the cause of being intentional i think
145:53 - means being aware not just of how things
145:55 - are connected to each other but the ways
145:56 - in which they are and how that
145:58 - differently impacts different folks and
146:00 - of course we've already talked about how
146:01 - black and brown people are like when we
146:03 - these systems often
146:05 - supposedly at the margins but really at
146:06 - the center um
146:09 - but like told we're not at the center
146:11 - and so i that's what i come to oh
146:13 - i'm hitting the 90 minute mark too i
146:15 - don't know if that made sense i hope so
146:17 - oh lord good luck to y'all i think it
146:20 - makes sense i tried
146:22 - i mean i just think um acknowledging
146:24 - that uh in relationality we have to also
146:27 - acknowledge hierarchy uh is that
146:30 - that hit pretty hard over here at the
146:33 - 90-minute mark
146:34 - yeah
146:35 - some some rephrasings of that question
146:38 - somebody wrote oh sorry io uh one one
146:41 - quick thing
146:43 - yeah i just wanted to say like a
146:45 - reframing of that question that i
146:46 - enjoyed was like this question posed uh
146:49 - line 844 what would a low click diet
146:53 - look like and i think that's like a
146:54 - different adaptation of what we asked
146:56 - which i think is like very i love that
146:59 - phrasing um
147:01 - uh
147:02 - sorry io go right ahead
147:05 - i i think i'm going to try to tackle the
147:07 - obsolescence
147:09 - question i don't i um
147:12 - from what i've learned from this
147:13 - conference
147:15 - um the mouse is not going to go extinct
147:17 - because the mouse is not what this is
147:20 - not the mouse
147:22 - right
147:23 - the mouse existed before this
147:26 - this you know
147:28 - is just a stand-in for something
147:31 - and i think that that's something is
147:33 - that ability to
147:35 - that and it comes from maybe from the
147:37 - digit right the ability to sort of point
147:40 - the ability to manipulate
147:42 - um
147:43 - so i i don't think that the mouse would
147:45 - ever
147:47 - um
147:48 - disappear
147:50 - it would transform
147:52 - right but i think the question should
147:54 - really be
147:56 - in the ability to manipulate
147:59 - right would it always with the mouse in
148:02 - whatever form it it's in
148:05 - would it always
148:08 - have that same type of power to oppress
148:12 - or is there a way to change that the way
148:15 - the way of the finger that points or the
148:19 - the the and even you know
148:21 - projectiles missiles guns right um is
148:25 - there those always existed
148:27 - it's just gonna change form is there a
148:29 - way to change the way that
148:32 - they interact
148:35 - and i think that's really the question
148:36 - is there a way to change the way the
148:38 - mouse interacts um whether it's a finger
148:42 - whether it's a a stick
148:44 - or whether it's a mouse right
148:48 - yeah
148:49 - yeah right
148:50 - i think i think that phrasing of like
148:52 - what would a low click diet actually
148:55 - be like i think
148:56 - that phrasing is revealing because you
148:59 - know the idea of a diet is also somebody
149:02 - gets sold right
149:04 - um
149:05 - like when you go on a when you go on a
149:07 - diet with food you just buy different
149:09 - food products that are specifically
149:10 - marketed to people who are going on a
149:12 - diet right
149:13 - so even even trying to envision like
149:16 - even trying to envision an
149:17 - intentionality around it um the metaphor
149:20 - that comes to mind for that immediately
149:22 - to people is like you know doing
149:24 - something else that's already
149:25 - preconditioned by by
149:27 - by capitalism
149:29 - right right right right
149:32 - yeah i oh you're um um
149:35 - so we're we're at like the
149:37 - like one minute okay
149:39 - does i owe your your comment about um
149:42 - i don't know the possibility of changing
149:44 - the power of the pointing act i think
149:47 - that's how i understood it like it right
149:49 - like is there
149:50 - is there a possibility for like shifting
149:52 - um the like oppressive
149:55 - power of the of the point pointer
149:59 - and it just reminded me of jonathan
150:01 - zong's
150:03 - essay that he wrote for the conference
150:05 - and um he's he's kind of he's talking
150:07 - about in hci this idea of like you know
150:11 - like we think we are we are in in this
150:13 - power position we are clicking we are
150:15 - like moving data around et cetera but
150:18 - the computer is also like acting back on
150:20 - us
150:21 - um and so
150:23 - i don't know i just wondered if in your
150:25 - question that has something to do like
150:28 - whatever's on the other side of like the
150:29 - pointing i guess like i don't know in
150:31 - terms of computers like what needs to be
150:35 - there in order for it to act back on us
150:37 - and is that something that like we need
150:39 - to pay more attention to right
150:41 - yeah i mean i i think um
150:44 - allison um alluded to this a little bit
150:47 - it's this this onion of capitalism right
150:50 - that you know it's not it's not the
150:52 - mouse clicking and you know that it's
150:55 - the system that we're that's embedded in
150:57 - that enables
151:01 - or you know that because we don't have
151:04 - if we don't have a mouse to click i'm
151:06 - sure capitalism will create a space for
151:09 - something else to do that same thing
151:12 - right that's what capitalism does so i
151:14 - think
151:15 - thinking about this within these systems
151:18 - um these onion systems i call them
151:21 - and this also goes um to a point on
151:24 - pedagogy um and educational institutions
151:27 - as well like
151:29 - it's all embedded within these systems
151:32 - that
151:33 - enable and create space for
151:35 - these objects that then do the
151:37 - extraction
151:40 - yeah
151:41 - and yet i completely agree with you i
151:43 - just want to make sure we don't end on
151:45 - the the note that i feel like everything
151:47 - i participate in ends on because it's
151:49 - right where it's like capitalism eats
151:50 - everything it just takes it
151:52 - you know it co-ops it and that's true
151:54 - and yet at the same time we do see so or
151:56 - at least i feel like i've seen so many
151:58 - different moments where despite that
152:00 - there are these little like you know
152:02 - these wonderful glimpses of okay this is
152:04 - a different way we can use this we can
152:06 - think of this little this device in a
152:08 - different way and it can allow us to
152:09 - open up some different ways of being
152:11 - that push against
152:13 - capitalism and push against racial
152:15 - capitalism
152:16 - and i think in many ways that is some of
152:18 - the space that y'all have created in
152:20 - this conference
152:21 - thank you yes
152:23 - it's amazing we'll join us next year for
152:25 - the mouse conference number three why
152:27 - not e-cigarettes
152:29 - as the theme
152:33 - joystick like mashup yeah
152:36 - exactly i want i want to thank you all

156:37 - incredible because what uh what a what
156:39 - an what a different piece of content for

157:00 - um
157:01 - thanks to dan schiffman who was
157:03 - championing this
157:05 - in in many ways including uh the
157:08 - design of the bot that allowed for
157:10 - people to contribute to the zine
157:12 - because that has been instrumental in
157:15 - designing something that people could
157:17 - feel connected to even though we're all
157:18 - like separated and we're not able to
157:20 - like hand meta
