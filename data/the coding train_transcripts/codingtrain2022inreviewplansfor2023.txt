03:26 - how does it work here in 2023 oh I'm so
03:30 - excited to be here live streaming I can
03:32 - I'm just gonna like burst out of my own
03:34 - skin uh let me know in the chat if the
03:37 - sound is coming through okay and then I
03:39 - will be getting started in just a minute
03:41 - with a brand new opening uh animation

06:07 - [Laughter]
06:11 - no here
06:14 - professional operation here everybody
06:17 - happy New Year and welcome to the coding
06:19 - train all that banging around the things
06:22 - was me trying to like make sure I was
06:23 - set up and ready to press the camera
06:25 - button all the while uh this new ready
06:29 - animation uh which has a little robot
06:32 - coming in and then the train arrives
06:38 - to go
06:42 - comes in and then I switched to me and
06:45 - he
06:48 - trained for the first time in probably
06:51 - well it's definitely well over a month I
06:53 - think I did actually did I do a live
06:55 - stream
06:55 - ER no no it was November it was November
06:59 - my last live stream it was November my
07:02 - last video upload proper video upload
07:04 - I've been doing some experiments with
07:06 - shorts as I will talk about in a moment
07:08 - why did this computer go off okay it's
07:10 - back
07:11 - um but I've been gone for a little while
07:13 - this happens to me
07:15 - but uh and usually I'm I'm I'm uh so
07:19 - first of all hi welcome maybe this is
07:20 - the first time you're tuning into the
07:22 - coding train well my name is Dan I am
07:25 - your host
07:26 - uh I do a variety of different things uh
07:29 - tutorial videos coding Challenge videos
07:31 - live streams all about coding and
07:35 - creativity and it's all meant to be
07:36 - friendly and welcoming for the total
07:38 - beginner so if you've never programmed
07:40 - before I welcome you I encourage you to
07:43 - stick around if you've programmed a lot
07:45 - and want to point out all my mistakes
07:47 - actually that's useful too stick around
07:49 - I enjoy that all of the things I enjoy
07:51 - I'm just taking a peek at the chat
07:55 - um just to see all right so I've got
07:57 - chat here Discord here computer here my
08:03 - confidence monitor because I am quite
08:05 - The Confident guy over here so
08:09 - things got really got in the way for me
08:11 - life got in the way families and
08:12 - personal stuff a lot of things going on
08:14 - I just was not able to do much in
08:17 - December
08:19 - um and so I I about usually do like a
08:22 - holiday Telethon and I I've had sort of
08:25 - like a holiday season sort of tradition
08:27 - it just didn't happen this year so
08:30 - let's kick off 2023
08:34 - um today I uh it's it's ironic because
08:38 - this is the end of my one-year
08:41 - sabbatical from teaching some of you may
08:43 - know that I happen to have a full-time
08:46 - day job teaching at NYU uh I broadcast
08:50 - live in my own sort of Home garage
08:52 - Studio here doing all of my coding train
08:54 - work a lot of the stuff that I do I is
08:57 - either
08:58 - um you know if I'm teaching a class then
09:00 - I want to make some videos for the class
09:02 - uh et cetera Etc you know the whole you
09:06 - don't necessarily know the whole deal
09:07 - but I don't want to go through it all
09:08 - right now the point of what I'm saying
09:09 - is I really thought that 2022 was going
09:13 - to be the the year of the coding train
09:16 - because I had a one-year sabbatical
09:19 - um and I think to some extent I'm
09:21 - probably being much too hard on myself
09:23 - because I really feel like it fizzled
09:25 - and I didn't get what I wanted to get
09:27 - done and I like nobody likes my videos
09:30 - just me really if you're like down the
09:32 - last few weeks this is not a call for
09:34 - sympathy please chat
09:37 - just be yeah just just to settle down I
09:40 - didn't even know what you're saying yet
09:40 - because you're like a minute behind in
09:42 - the past and I'm in the future and I
09:44 - don't know if you're in Australia it was
09:45 - like
09:46 - 20 23 3 days ago but anyway
09:49 - I sort of feel like maybe
09:54 - teaching
09:56 - is one things that keeps me grounded and
10:00 - moving forward with the coding train
10:02 - because I am talking about things in
10:05 - class on a regular schedule I have to I
10:08 - have to be accountable I have to be
10:09 - prepared for it
10:11 - students in those classes have amazing
10:13 - ideas and questions that lead me to
10:17 - topics that I want to do a video to help
10:19 - answer those questions so I think maybe
10:22 - just maybe you heard it here first
10:24 - everybody
10:26 - bring out the Bell
10:29 - 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
10:33 - not the best year if I'm being perfectly
10:36 - honest 2023 maybe this will be
10:39 - the year of the coding train so um this
10:43 - is my plan for today uh I I wanted to
10:46 - like I
10:47 - trust me I thought of like a million
10:49 - reasons and excuses why I couldn't do
10:52 - this live stream today
10:54 - but by golly I'm here I'm I'm here uh
10:59 - um
11:01 - Kitty tasks is asking can you start I
11:03 - don't know if that means like why are
11:05 - you just talking instead of coding
11:07 - because uh I hate to break it to you I
11:09 - got some news for you a lot of talking
11:11 - in the live stream not so much to the
11:13 - coding
11:15 - um but uh but maybe Kitty is stuck on
11:18 - like the opening animation oh my hair my
11:20 - hair my hair all right uh Bruno says for
11:23 - for me every year is the year of the
11:25 - codec drain that is lovely thank you for
11:28 - that
11:29 - um Bruno
11:31 - um
11:32 - so what I would like to do today this is
11:35 - my plan ah Navid a great question can I
11:37 - ask so today's just going to be a kind
11:39 - of hanging out stream I don't have a
11:41 - plan
11:42 - although not that I ever really had
11:44 - anything that different
11:46 - um does this button work yes it does so
11:48 - I'll come back to that in a second uh
11:50 - Navid asks can I ask what started the
11:52 - coding train
11:54 - interesting question
11:57 - I don't know how to answer this
12:00 - should I talk about how my parents met
12:03 - no that's weird
12:07 - um what started the code again how far
12:09 - back should I go
12:11 - here's what I think started the coding
12:13 - train
12:15 - um
12:16 - my teaching just just to bring it all
12:19 - back together to that I wanted to make
12:22 - videos for my classes and this we're
12:25 - talking about over 10 years ago now so I
12:27 - think probably one of the First videos I
12:29 - recorded for students in a class that I
12:32 - was taking was in 2012. so that's
12:33 - probably what started it uh I could make
12:36 - this a longer story I think I've told
12:38 - versions of this story with more more
12:40 - fewer or more details I think there's a
12:42 - podcast called create canvas from the
12:44 - processing foundation with saubercon you
12:46 - could look that up where I talked about
12:47 - this more but basically at one point I
12:51 - uh in 2015 I started uploading some of
12:54 - these videos I had made to YouTube and
12:57 - the rest if you uh um the old prostate
13:02 - videos that were in Vimeo that is
13:04 - correct denisovich uh and yes how your
13:07 - parents met is a bit too far back okay
13:09 - agreed
13:11 - uh I did have a dream of I didn't ever
13:13 - dream of making my own TV show but can
13:15 - we just talk about wait can we be can I
13:18 - be completely self-indulgent for a
13:20 - second
13:22 - I was always a theater geek
13:26 - um so I was any any kind of geek I was I
13:29 - was like into math I was into computers
13:31 - I was into science I was into like
13:33 - science fiction all that stuff but I
13:36 - really loved the theater
13:38 - specifically musical theater I have very
13:41 - little musical Talent uh I had enough of
13:44 - a goofball that I could go up on stage
13:45 - and kind of like act silly and people
13:47 - would enjoy it but I I also never really
13:49 - like
13:50 - you know sort of
13:53 - um really
13:55 - um meaningfully
13:57 - um thoughtful and well
14:00 - I'm not have a talent for the acting if
14:03 - you will
14:05 - so but I I I think I just always had
14:09 - this like itch to do more performing and
14:12 - to be involved and sort of in
14:13 - entertainment in some way and I think
14:17 - YouTube
14:18 - you know is allowing me to sort of try
14:21 - that in my own bizarre Fashion For
14:24 - Better or Worse and um
14:26 - you know I've kind of been uh in the
14:28 - last month just questioning a lot and I
14:32 - don't know but I think I think I'm I'm
14:33 - ready to like double down on what it is
14:36 - that I feel I do well
14:39 - which is to communicate ideas around
14:42 - programming
14:43 - for people who are new to programming
14:46 - and I would I don't know that I do it
14:49 - well for like a total perfect like sort
14:52 - of global diverse audience because I
14:55 - recognize that I have a certain you know
14:57 - cultural background and identity that
15:00 - sort of uh and references that maybe
15:02 - some people really can identify with
15:04 - it's my goal for the coding train and my
15:07 - work to be as welcoming and inclusive as
15:09 - possible but anyway
15:11 - um but I don't know if I do that but I
15:14 - do think that I have over 20 years of
15:17 - practicing this uh found my way to an
15:20 - ability to kind of like talk through the
15:22 - steps of a programming problem or
15:24 - explain basic programming Concepts to
15:27 - all to a wide beginner audience
15:30 - um Advanced sophisticated deep level
15:35 - software engineering and computer
15:36 - science topics maybe not as much my
15:38 - thing but yeah I think I'm reflecting a
15:40 - lot let me say I know this will shock
15:43 - you many of you this will come as a
15:44 - total shock because of my you know
15:47 - youthful Timothy chalamet good looks
15:53 - but uh and thank you thank you Layla I
15:56 - don't know Bizarro what time of day is
15:57 - it for you that it's time for your
15:58 - whiskey
16:00 - um
16:01 - chat chat GPT people are asking about
16:03 - chat GPT yet so anyway this year
16:06 - this is the year 2023 is the year that I
16:09 - turn 5-0
16:13 - I do sort of it's like a weird sort of
16:16 - feeling it's like you know I I I've
16:18 - never felt older
16:20 - until like probably like two or three
16:22 - years ago
16:24 - but I also think like by golly
16:29 - I could be on YouTube
16:32 - I can do the YouTube thing with the
16:34 - youths
16:37 - I'm gonna I'm gonna focus on the Cody
16:39 - train making entertainment stuff making
16:40 - educational stuff and just seeing what I
16:42 - can do in 2023. um so so let's get that
16:46 - started this is my hope this is my plan
16:47 - for today I don't want to be here past
16:50 - like two o'clock because
16:52 - um I want to spend some time with my
16:55 - kids my wife has been out of town mostly
16:58 - for the LA uh dealing with some family
17:00 - stuff for the last two months basically
17:02 - which is
17:04 - um why I haven't been able to do as much
17:06 - work or stream as much but we're kind of
17:09 - hitting the reset button uh she's back
17:11 - and I want to do some nice family stuff
17:12 - nobody has school tomorrow either so but
17:15 - I wanted to get this stream in to feel
17:16 - like I'm starting off 2023 and
17:20 - um more to come but so what I thought I
17:22 - would do is I wanted to I've got my
17:24 - whiteboard oh which I didn't even figure
17:26 - out
17:28 - um
17:29 - I uh
17:32 - Martin says I am 52 and 50 was a nice
17:35 - one thank you I am so pleased yeah cut
17:38 - your beard and you'll be three I do you
17:40 - know yeah we don't need to talk about uh
17:45 - it's okay I guess for me to talk about
17:46 - me because you're watching you could
17:48 - turn it off if you don't want to hear me
17:50 - talk about me this is helpful I mean
17:53 - therapy is uh very useful I encourage
17:55 - everybody if you are able to and uh um
17:58 - to be therapized I think that's the
18:01 - proper technical way of explaining that
18:03 - but also
18:06 - talking about myself here on the live
18:09 - stream to be a somewhat of helpful
18:10 - therapy as well
18:12 - um
18:14 - so uh but thank you Martin your chat
18:18 - scrolled by but I appreciate I I I'm
18:21 - constantly amazed you know who knows how
18:23 - accurate it is but if I look at my
18:24 - YouTube channel
18:25 - my audience is you know my children are
18:28 - approaching the age of my audience let
18:30 - me just put it that way
18:32 - um so uh uh you are a YouTube you need
18:36 - to talk about yourself that's good are
18:38 - you bad at CSS
18:40 - because P5 turns JavaScript to CSS I
18:43 - don't understand that question I am bad
18:45 - at CSS
18:46 - uh uh all right can we expect machine
18:50 - learning tutorials can we talk about
18:52 - Timothy
18:55 - what is your favorite framework
18:57 - processing processing is always will
19:01 - always be my favorite framework
19:03 - just it's it's where I where everything
19:06 - began for me
19:09 - um all right
19:11 - so this is my plan for today it's
19:13 - already 12 20.
19:15 - um
19:16 - I oh the Whiteboard so let's see what
19:18 - happens if I press this button I did not
19:20 - check this I have no idea what camera
19:22 - it's going to turn on when I press this
19:25 - oh well luckily for me that worked
19:29 - let's see if I have a
19:33 - working marker
19:36 - boy this the lighting is weird
19:39 - so I moved a lot of like you know I had
19:41 - completely reconfigured I'm looking at
19:43 - my monitor over there I completely
19:44 - reconfigured this room
19:46 - for
19:48 - um
19:49 - working on my Apple II plus computer and
19:52 - I have now this morning before I started
19:54 - streaming I put everything back and I'm
19:56 - assuming you can still hear and see me
19:57 - okay I see the chat I can actually
19:59 - almost see the chat from here because I
20:01 - can read the latest message is
20:02 - Javascript the future
20:04 - my vision is terrible something that
20:07 - happens to you when you get older
20:09 - also oh no never mind
20:14 - sometimes like random thoughts pop in my
20:16 - head and I'm about to say that I'm like
20:18 - don't talk about that on the live stream
20:19 - all right let me see if I can brighten
20:21 - this view up a little bit I think that
20:23 - might help
20:25 - uh oh it says it's kind of what is going
20:28 - on here
20:30 - something's weird with this camera I
20:32 - probably did some weird settings to this
20:34 - camera
20:35 - [Music]
20:36 - um
20:37 - based on
20:41 - um
20:42 - when I had it with the Apple II plus I
20:45 - will worry about that later as long as
20:46 - it is mostly legible for you let's find
20:49 - out so I want to make two columns
20:54 - 20 22
20:57 - and 20 23.
21:01 - I want to look back
21:06 - time to sweep up
21:09 - I want to look back where am I standing
21:12 - here how does this work move this over
21:13 - maybe okay I want to look back and make
21:16 - a list of the things that I did in 2022
21:18 - and talk about you know what went well
21:21 - what didn't go well what's unresolved
21:23 - which will probably lead me to a list of
21:26 - things I would like to accomplish in
21:27 - 2023 now I don't I haven't seen Simon
21:30 - yet in the chat
21:32 - it's good I mean maybe it's good the
21:34 - time it's not here because Simon is
21:36 - always the voice in the back of my head
21:37 - is like which is damn
21:40 - whenever you make one of these lists
21:43 - actually get to anything on the list
21:45 - because you get distracted by other
21:47 - things that's true that might be true
21:49 - but can I can let me just start let me
21:51 - try start fresh wipe the Slate clean
21:54 - I hope to like make this list and then
21:56 - feel good about 2022 and then kind of
22:00 - chart out some things that I would like
22:02 - to do in 2023. I actually had on this
22:04 - whiteboard a whole other list that I
22:06 - made like some other time and it was
22:07 - like oh I didn't do most of that stuff
22:08 - but it'll come back up again all right
22:10 - so moving back
22:13 - um
22:15 - yeah so let me know if the Whiteboard
22:17 - view needs any adjustment because and
22:21 - I'm going to come back to here actually
22:22 - so now I'm on the what's over here oh
22:25 - okay
22:26 - um that's gonna drive me crazy the fact
22:28 - that my green screen is key is off there
22:33 - um
22:34 - oh Simon is here uh
22:38 - uh and I don't uh
22:42 - uh
22:42 - uh okay okay so I'm reading the the
22:46 - Discord chat enjoying that
22:48 - um okay let me see let me just turn this
22:51 - slightly okay I'm gonna loosen
22:54 - this you know this is how I do it on the
22:57 - coding train live you know there's just
22:59 - me here did that fix the key that
23:02 - definitely did where's it back it's back
23:04 - and it is gone okay so that should do it
23:10 - Okay so
23:13 - there's a few ways
23:16 - it still looks dark it's the like the
23:19 - question is is this good enough for
23:21 - today I think it is
23:23 - um that's good excuse the laugh is there
23:25 - an update on the poll app all right hold
23:27 - on everybody too many questions I can't
23:29 - follow them all I should do actually
23:31 - what was that thing let's do that thing
23:34 - um just so um if there are some
23:36 - questions people want me to address
23:38 - um I like this online questions thing
23:42 - um that I use that one time
23:44 - uh audience or speaker okay admin
23:48 - well I'm definitely not going to have to
23:52 - do this because I think if
23:54 - oh secret password no no the this is
23:57 - okay so let's do uh three one four one
24:01 - five nine that's gonna be our event
24:05 - and my secret password is going to be
24:10 - rainbow puppy unicorn
24:14 - chocolate lava delightfulness
24:18 - okay and now I'm gonna hit create
24:22 - and never
24:26 - um okay so this is now if I how do I how
24:30 - do I get this I should have done this on
24:32 - my other computer
24:33 - online questions where do I where do I
24:36 - find
24:38 - the page that I send out to people
24:41 - oh yeah ah audience members so you go to
24:43 - onlinequestions.org and you enter
24:45 - 3.14159
24:49 - and at some point this is going to
24:52 - populate with questions
24:54 - I am going to move those over here
24:58 - I should make that maybe a pinned
25:02 - comment
25:06 - so
25:08 - um how are you is the first question
25:10 - there we go so uh let's
25:15 - let's
25:16 - um just hold on a sec
25:20 - um
25:22 - put in this code 3.14159
25:30 - and
25:32 - I will pin it
25:36 - oops that's the wrong I've been the
25:38 - wrong message
25:41 - okay come on everybody
25:43 - message on pin yeah yeah go away okay
25:47 - pin message
25:49 - all right so now
25:52 - we see that uh if you want to ask a
25:55 - question of me you can post it here
25:59 - um
26:01 - random guy it's kind of funny you should
26:03 - say that ah happy New Year Christian
26:05 - vikbon all right uh have you tried the
26:08 - new chat AI for coding yes and uh more
26:10 - about that uh later today hopefully
26:13 - because that should definitely go on the
26:14 - 2023 list
26:16 - um all right so I'm gonna move these off
26:18 - okay
26:19 - so now
26:20 - there are a few different ways I can
26:22 - look at what did I do in 2022
26:27 - so I think probably
26:29 - the is the best place for me to start is
26:33 - the sort of core work of the coding
26:35 - train which is the YouTube channel
26:37 - itself
26:39 - and I think if I go here under videos
26:43 - I can go to recently uploaded
26:47 - and
26:48 - let's just see
26:52 - um I think this was a 2021 video
26:59 - one year ago why does it November 2021
27:02 - yes so
27:05 - if we're talking about
27:08 - no um this is actually not look at this
27:10 - I made okay so let's talk about this
27:13 - coding challenges so let me add to the
27:16 - Whiteboard I wonder if I should do like
27:17 - a split screen thing but
27:19 - um I'll just press the buttons so
27:22 - um 2022 we did coding challenges
27:27 - uh challenges
27:32 - uh ASCII video
27:37 - I already can't remember
27:40 - uh
27:45 - right slide puzzle ASCII and Prime
27:48 - spiral
27:50 - ASCII
27:53 - slide puzzle
27:57 - Prime spiral
27:59 - so that's three coding challenges that I
28:02 - did
28:04 - then we had the mandelbub
28:08 - mandelbulb and Pie in the Sky
28:15 - mandelbulb
28:19 - Pi Day
28:22 - um I also did what else what else what
28:25 - else what else what else
28:27 - uh Monty Hall wave function collapse
28:39 - wave function collapse see look I did
28:41 - stuff in 2022. it's not so bad wave
28:45 - function collapse
28:47 - uh which uh and then a horizontal
28:51 - Directional Drilling
28:54 - um
28:55 - so those were the coding challenges
29:00 - now
29:01 - let's look up uh tutorials
29:07 - and I forgot to talk about
29:09 - the sponsor of the coding train but
29:11 - that's I'll address that in a minute
29:14 - um
29:16 - uh okay so I did local storage and I did
29:20 - nature of code 2.6
29:25 - we did a P5 local storage
29:31 - and nature of code 2.6
29:35 - okay
29:40 - um what else do we got
29:43 - um then I let's
29:45 - let's do ah okay then Apple two
29:49 - so the Apple II series was a totally
29:51 - brand new thing I mean they're kind of
29:53 - under the coding challenge umbrella but
29:56 - I really think of them as separate
30:00 - um I did snake
30:03 - tree
30:04 - and uh what was the last one that I did
30:07 - snake tree oh and 3D render
30:12 - okay
30:13 - so this is and then I'm gonna put here
30:16 - other
30:18 - the anal retentive coder which you know
30:22 - I thought was going to be my big hit in
30:25 - 2022 that's probably the least viewed
30:28 - video on the channel so let's look at
30:30 - this for a second so this is actually
30:32 - like this is making me feel a little
30:34 - better uh in that there were one two
30:39 - three four five six seven eight coding
30:41 - challenges you know by goal would be if
30:44 - I had a goal would be to have 12 coding
30:47 - challenges I mean I think if you count
30:49 - these I could kind of get up to 11. it
30:53 - goes to 11. like the idea that there'd
30:55 - be one coding challenge per month those
30:58 - videos at you know they used to be the
31:00 - kind of thing that
31:01 - would take approximately 24 hours to do
31:05 - because I think of an idea I'd sort of
31:08 - just go and code it while recording and
31:11 - then
31:12 - chop it up the video without really any
31:14 - editing or post-production and then
31:15 - upload it
31:17 - now the videos have the coding
31:19 - challenges videos have expanded where I
31:20 - do a little bit more research and try to
31:22 - bring in some more examples and
31:23 - references but um I'd be curious to know
31:27 - from the chat uh
31:30 - which one of these were your favorites
31:33 - or which one of these would you like to
31:36 - see a follow-up on I can say I you know
31:38 - I follow the numbers on the coding train
31:40 - pretty closely the a Visa like not
31:43 - talking about the Apple II for a second
31:44 - this the ASCII video one was Pro I
31:49 - pretty sure it was the most watched
31:52 - um followed somewhat closely by the
31:56 - prime spiral
31:58 - we can kind of fact check this why is it
32:00 - so dark
32:02 - there's something weird about this
32:06 - settings on the camera that's so dark
32:10 - um
32:11 - let's take a look so I'm just coming
32:13 - back over here for a second so wave
32:15 - function collab and you know I'm not in
32:18 - this for the views
32:21 - I'm not in this for the future I mean I
32:23 - I do I do look at the views but um
32:27 - you can see the ASCII text one is it's
32:31 - really um the ASCII text one we're at uh
32:36 - you know it's the oldest one so it had
32:37 - the most time but it's sort of well and
32:39 - far above Prime spiral is also pretty
32:41 - far um and the rest are in the more
32:43 - usual range but I agree wave function
32:46 - collapse in many ways is the most
32:48 - memorable in the sense that I did that
32:51 - over nine hours of live streaming and
32:54 - condensed it all down into a one hour
32:57 - and 18 minute Astro penguin relax coding
33:00 - Cabana I uh the Cabana is not something
33:02 - I have access to anymore but I could I I
33:06 - could sort of recreate that feeling in
33:08 - new and different ways
33:10 - um thank you random guy for saying
33:13 - um 3D renderers the tippy top that's
33:15 - great yeah so um
33:17 - so let's think about for a moment what
33:21 - really requires
33:23 - um
33:25 - and I it's driving me crazy while the
33:27 - why the camera is so dark but I'm just
33:29 - not going to worry about it
33:31 - um what so one thing that really
33:34 - absolutely requires a follow-up and I've
33:37 - been kind of afraid to tackle it because
33:39 - it's I don't know how to do it but it
33:41 - would be wave function collapse uh
33:45 - overlapping
33:49 - so if we're thinking about what are
33:52 - ideas for challenges
33:55 - wave function collapse overlapping model
33:59 - is absolutely one
34:02 - you know I always like to do something
34:04 - for Pi Day so let's put down Pi Day as
34:07 - something we'll do in 2023 I have no
34:10 - ideas for it so something that we could
34:13 - start thinking of now if anybody has
34:14 - anything clever uh I'd be game for that
34:18 - uh
34:20 - um
34:21 - mandelbobe led me to be interested in
34:26 - um what are they called sine distance
34:28 - functions
34:29 - so that's something I'm absolutely
34:31 - interested in tackling put that on the
34:34 - list here
34:36 - um
34:38 - I don't see any other follow-ups
34:41 - that are obvious to me uh in terms of
34:46 - coding challenges that are directly
34:48 - coming from here I could come up I could
34:50 - go back and look at the GitHub repo that
34:52 - has a bunch of lists of ideas and find
34:54 - some of them
34:56 - um but that's sort of this is sort of
34:58 - where I am so you know could I get
35:01 - what's a goal what's a good goal
35:04 - I mean I just want to like what if we
35:06 - said 10
35:08 - challenges and I don't not retro
35:10 - Computing so 10 not retro Computing
35:14 - challenges for 2023. let's set that as a
35:18 - goal and some of them could be simple
35:20 - ones just a 10 minute video why not
35:22 - right
35:24 - okay so we got three ideas oh three
35:26 - already here
35:29 - um okay
35:32 - um
35:34 - so let me I want to I want to do uh
35:39 - I'm gonna make some other categories
35:41 - here
35:42 - nebula
35:47 - um
35:48 - there's a category I thought of two
35:51 - things which is why I want to make two
35:53 - other categories and the other one just
35:55 - completely went out of my brain ah yes
35:59 - books writing so we'll call it nebula
36:01 - and we'll call it uh NOC
36:06 - so um
36:08 - this is why so the other thing that I
36:11 - accomplished this year is which led me
36:15 - to doing these videos is the nebula
36:19 - class
36:20 - what is code so I'm going to take a
36:22 - minute nebula is a sponsor of the coding
36:24 - train and in many ways saying it's a
36:26 - sponsor is I mean it's accurate in the
36:28 - sense that I am paid to talk about
36:30 - nebula but nebula is also a project that
36:33 - I am
36:34 - um uh more deeply involved with a sort
36:37 - of co-creator and owner of uh the
36:40 - platform I I don't I I I I hesitate to
36:43 - say that because it sounds like I don't
36:45 - want to take credit for anything because
36:46 - it's like all other people doing amazing
36:48 - work but um I can tell you now that if
36:51 - you go to go Dot uh nebula let's see if
36:55 - I can get this to work dot TV slash what
36:58 - is code
36:59 - so um so this is uh just to be clear
37:02 - even though I'm talking about my work uh
37:05 - for you know whatever FCC and every
37:08 - guidelines this is also I'm talking
37:10 - about a sponsorship a paid this is a
37:12 - paid product endorsement here but you
37:16 - know not just a random thing it's
37:17 - something that I care about and involved
37:19 - with so I worked on this year with a
37:22 - nebula is if you so if you're not
37:24 - familiar with nebula it's a streaming
37:25 - platform for uh educational creators on
37:30 - YouTube and that's not the best way to
37:31 - describe it probably I've probably
37:33 - botched that
37:34 - um there's tons of original content
37:37 - documentaries you know I don't know what
37:39 - you watch on YouTube but I think about
37:41 - channels that I watch like uh you know
37:43 - Wendover Productions uh practical
37:46 - engineering real engineering uh Jordan
37:49 - Herod
37:52 - um Patrick Williams all of these
37:54 - creators uh are on uh nebula and they
37:57 - have original content Patrick Williams
37:58 - has a movie he made I'm obsessed with
38:00 - this thing called jet lag the game
38:03 - um but anyway let's see if I can play
38:04 - this trailer right now one of the things
38:06 - that I did for nebula is create this
38:07 - class about what is programming what is
38:10 - code for uh you know this could be for
38:13 - someone who's never watched the coding
38:14 - train before it never programmed before
38:15 - let's see if the sound goes through here
38:18 - my name is Dan and I have spent almost
38:20 - the last 20 years teaching coding
38:26 - be under the false impression that to
38:28 - code your favorite thing must be
38:30 - computers
38:32 - I'm here to tell you that learning to
38:33 - code is something that may just expand
38:36 - the way you approach the passions in
38:38 - your life
38:40 - if you have never written a line of code
38:42 - in your life you're in the right place
38:45 - [Music]
38:48 - okay you know I think it's really
38:50 - important as somebody who makes stuff on
38:53 - the internet to not only do stuff on one
38:57 - platform I don't actually have this
38:59 - problem for the most part but a lot of
39:01 - the if I go to nebula.tv a lot of
39:05 - creators on YouTube let's see if I go to
39:07 - videos
39:09 - um there are a lot of issues with I'm
39:12 - trying to see especially like certain
39:14 - kind of content if I go to history I
39:17 - think is a good example of this a lot of
39:19 - real
39:21 - real life lore and real-time history a
39:24 - lot of these videos have issues on
39:27 - YouTube in terms of some of the the
39:29 - content not able to be uh I'm sorry I'm
39:33 - like like oh what do I want to watch
39:34 - here so uh uh demonetized or age
39:38 - restricted and so this is kind of a nice
39:41 - platform uh where these videos can
39:43 - educational videos with really important
39:45 - topics can be seen
39:48 - um I'm just curious uh uh if you go to
39:52 - classes which is the thing that I'm kind
39:54 - of plugging here I this this I really
39:57 - should watch video editing Basics Adam
39:59 - Neely is awesome so all this stuff is
40:01 - here so
40:02 - um you can go to this link
40:05 - um
40:05 - and uh click sign up and you'll get like
40:08 - a discount for as a fan of the coding
40:10 - train but I have a hack for you
40:13 - which is available
40:18 - um only today and tomorrow which is that
40:22 - if you go to it's this link here
40:27 - uh whoops
40:28 - there we go if you go to
40:32 - curiositystream.com choo choo
40:36 - let's make sure that works
40:38 - you can actually sign up for the Curious
40:41 - curiosity streams bundle
40:44 - so this is signing up for curiosity
40:46 - stream which is a great service where
40:47 - you get like you know thousands of all
40:49 - these documentaries and you get it for
40:51 - just like nebula is five dollars a month
40:53 - I think with my code it's four dollars a
40:55 - month
40:56 - but this is less than one dollar a month
40:58 - for the entire year so you can get
41:01 - curiosity stream and this bundle
41:04 - includes complementary access to nebula
41:07 - um you have to be clever about this
41:09 - because yeah you want to make sure you
41:10 - click on this one because there's lots
41:12 - of other it's confusing like it says
41:15 - that this one includes nebula and then
41:18 - it doesn't say that here but I I have it
41:21 - on good authority that this absolutely
41:23 - includes nebula the only thing is which
41:25 - a little bit unfortunate is if you sign
41:28 - up for nebula through the front door the
41:30 - four dollars a month yeah from my
41:32 - classes page that's great you should do
41:34 - that
41:35 - um you get everything nebula nebula
41:37 - classes this you get nebula it is really
41:40 - really cheap but you don't get nebula
41:42 - classes so you have to add on a one
41:44 - dollar per month extra for nebula
41:46 - classes it's kind of confusing but don't
41:49 - worry all you need to do is just email
41:51 - Daniel thecodingtrain.com if you're
41:54 - confused by this and I will make sure to
41:55 - help you because I want want people to
41:57 - be able to watch the class if they're
41:58 - interested in it so the cheapest way if
42:01 - you're interested in getting the class
42:03 - is to get kind of a hack it's only this
42:06 - this discount is uh I mean it's still
42:08 - going to be heavily discounted after
42:09 - January 2nd but it's like a New Year's
42:11 - promotion so today January 1st tomorrow
42:15 - January 2nd for
42:17 - 97 cents a month you know you get uh all
42:22 - uh
42:23 - curiosity stream and nebula then one
42:26 - dollar per month extra nebula classes I
42:28 - I've gone on for too long about this uh
42:30 - really I just I love the nebula platform
42:32 - I've started watching
42:34 - um you know all the videos there are ad
42:35 - free it's a good I frankly find it like
42:38 - a really good place for Discovery
42:39 - because YouTube algorithm uh search and
42:41 - Discovery works great for me but I find
42:43 - a lot of stuff that I'm really
42:44 - interested in here uh this this is what
42:47 - I'm obsessed with jet lag the game uh if
42:50 - you haven't watched maybe maybe this is
42:52 - not your thing but I love this jet lag
42:54 - the game uh a game show I would love to
42:57 - go on it frankly although I'd probably
42:58 - be terrible okay sorry so that's my plug
43:01 - sponsor stuff I'm gonna put that aside I
43:04 - should put it as like a it's it's all
43:06 - Linked In the video description I didn't
43:08 - make it a pin comment let's check out
43:09 - we're gonna get back to the topic at
43:11 - hand which is reviewing 2022 but that
43:14 - was that was part of my 2020 review
43:16 - because this was a lot of work and a lot
43:19 - of time and effort went into producing
43:21 - this class
43:22 - um and I want to uh
43:24 - I'm hoping I don't know if this is true
43:26 - but if you're somebody out there why is
43:29 - it so dark
43:31 - what's crazy is it's telling me on the
43:33 - back of the you know I'm just gonna I
43:36 - don't care you're lying to me
43:38 - we're gonna brighten you up
43:40 - you're lying to me
43:42 - let's do that there we go
43:45 - um
43:47 - uh if you are somebody out there I don't
43:49 - know if anybody out there this exists
43:51 - who happen to find the what is code
43:54 - class on nebula watched it got
43:56 - interested in code and you're now
43:58 - watching this live stream or later or
44:00 - some other video I mean I don't let me
44:01 - know that would be so thrilling and
44:03 - exciting to me okay so nebula
44:06 - we got through that let's briefly check
44:08 - in on the online questions guest
44:10 - tutorials
44:11 - all right
44:13 - um let's add that so oh yeah did I let's
44:17 - I care I don't think I did any guests in
44:20 - 2022.
44:23 - Maybe
44:25 - so let's put this on the list
44:29 - I don't want to like necessarily make a
44:31 - list of guests here that might be kind
44:33 - of awkward but um but definitely guests
44:37 - for 2022. uh oh but the reason why I was
44:39 - talking about nebula is so what do I
44:42 - want to do in 2023 on the nebula
44:46 - platform so I'll tell you one thing I
44:48 - definitely want to do and if anybody has
44:51 - any thoughts so I want to make a video
44:55 - um
44:55 - one of the things on nebula
44:59 - I should just sign into my account
45:01 - because oh as Originals
45:03 - so nebula has a lot of original content
45:07 - um the things that you can't find on
45:11 - um
45:11 - that aren't on YouTube and one of the
45:14 - things is the series called working
45:17 - titles how do I find that
45:20 - modern conflicts is what I was talking
45:22 - about real life lore yeah those are
45:24 - um this is great too that time when is a
45:27 - really fun series
45:29 - um
45:30 - uh where is a working titles
45:35 - yeah so um oh there's one 19 days ago so
45:39 - working titles is a series about uh
45:43 - title sequences of different
45:45 - um TV shows movies games
45:48 - um
45:50 - whole ghost AI for Pac-Man oh I like
45:53 - this
45:54 - um so I
45:57 - so if we look at this
45:59 - um
45:59 - oh we can't wait I'm not signed in so
46:02 - I'm just going to put this on my list
46:04 - what I would like to do is make a
46:08 - working titles video about the show
46:11 - severance
46:16 - this is a goal of mine
46:18 - if you're not familiar Severance is an
46:20 - Apple TV Plus show that I became
46:23 - somewhat obsessed with I have a few
46:25 - different project ongoing projects I
46:27 - could put them in here so like
46:30 - um under under other could well they're
46:33 - not videos but like uh
46:36 - so if I put them under here we would put
46:38 - the
46:39 - macro data refinement and you you are
46:45 - bot so these are like some projects that
46:49 - I have kind of worked on just as like
46:50 - sort of goofing around projects and I
46:53 - would like to do a video so Severance is
46:56 - a television Apple TV plus television
46:58 - show I'm not going to spoil it for
46:59 - anyone I highly recommend if you're able
47:01 - to watch it it's really excellent uh you
47:04 - know it's still dark a little disturbing
47:05 - so you know your mileage may vary
47:07 - depending on whether that's your jam but
47:09 - um
47:10 - I um one of the the title sequence is
47:15 - this incredible 3D animated Avatar kind
47:20 - of computer Graphics
47:21 - uh generated sequence that I find
47:24 - beautiful amazing and wonderful and I
47:26 - would love to do a kind of explainer
47:29 - video about that title sequence now this
47:33 - is not something that I've ever done
47:34 - before I don't do explainer videos or
47:36 - video essays I do
47:39 - clear took it Kentucky videos that's how
47:42 - I describe them
47:43 - but that I would like to do I also was
47:47 - thinking about doing a history
47:53 - of computing series
47:57 - that would be more documentary like my
48:00 - idea for it is that I would sort of
48:03 - dress you know maybe I'd start with the
48:05 - 1950s
48:06 - uh and I would uh oh sort of like dress
48:10 - and try to shoot it in the sort of style
48:12 - of the decade so there'd be a 1950s
48:14 - episode it's like one division for
48:17 - computer graph computer Computing
48:20 - documentary so these are two ideas I
48:23 - have for nebula but it um you know
48:26 - obviously these are things that wouldn't
48:27 - be on YouTube they would be sort of more
48:30 - produced I would you know the one thing
48:32 - nice thing about doing something with
48:33 - nebula is it's a collaboration for me
48:35 - they have a whole production team I can
48:37 - you know pitch an idea if I can get it
48:39 - approved it's not necessarily like it's
48:42 - not a a a necessarily like a revenue
48:44 - generating thing for me although the
48:46 - sponsorship stuff all works out
48:47 - terrifically but it's something for me
48:50 - to be able to be more creative and try
48:51 - new things so curious about you know
48:55 - people's thoughts or interest in that
48:56 - but that's kind of where I'm thinking so
48:58 - that's nebula but if people have ideas
49:01 - for ambitious
49:04 - projects I can do
49:07 - um that are uh kind of out there that
49:11 - you wouldn't think would be normally
49:12 - coding train thing but you think I might
49:14 - be good at or might be able to make
49:16 - happen uh nebula is a way for making
49:18 - making those things happen you know for
49:21 - things that I couldn't just make happen
49:22 - on my own on YouTube so I would love
49:25 - your suggestions and thoughts about that
49:26 - all right we've got our 2022 board our
49:30 - 2023 board uh we are
49:34 - we're not even one hour in are we yeah
49:36 - we're not even one hour in so
49:39 - uh yeah that would be cool explain how
49:41 - basic went from Dartmouth to Microsoft
49:43 - exactly exactly and I lost the Discord
49:46 - chat
49:48 - okay exposure come for the one oh
49:50 - opening sequence of severance yeah
49:53 - um all right
49:54 - so let me take a look at the uh
49:57 - questions
50:01 - oh sorry
50:03 - all right let's answer some of these
50:05 - questions and I think if I go to the
50:07 - admin page maybe I should just go to the
50:10 - admin page hold on
50:12 - online questions
50:14 - uh for speaker admin
50:24 - let's see uh open there we go Okay so
50:30 - is chat GPU we'll chat GPT let's answer
50:33 - will chat gbt make our programming
50:36 - experience useless so I think what this
50:39 - is asking if I could rephrase the
50:41 - question a bit is and let me take a sip
50:43 - of my coffee here my throat
50:48 - is um
50:52 - getting a little dry here okay
50:55 - is chat we'll chat so I think the
50:58 - question is asking
51:01 - will chat GPT make programmers obsolete
51:04 - will I know no longer need to learn how
51:07 - to code because I can just write up an
51:10 - idea and chat GPT will translate that
51:12 - into code for me
51:15 - I don't think we're there yet not based
51:18 - on my experience working with chat chat
51:20 - gbt
51:21 - I also think there is a certain Joy
51:25 - to programming to solving the puzzle I
51:28 - think that I think there's a lot of
51:30 - questionable aspects about kind of
51:34 - copyright and ownership and exploitation
51:37 - of Labor that's all wrapped up in the
51:39 - chat GPT I don't feel
51:41 - Adept or knowledgeable enough to really
51:44 - tackle that side of it but if we put
51:46 - that aside which you really can but if I
51:49 - allow myself very briefly to put that
51:51 - aside
51:53 - I think that there is a tremendous
51:55 - amount of potential for systems like
51:59 - chat GPT to be a tool in the
52:02 - programmer's toolbox to give you some
52:04 - starter code you know in the same way
52:07 - that stack Overflow is the coding train
52:10 - is the nature of code book is you know I
52:13 - often will start working on something
52:14 - from an example if maybe I could get to
52:17 - that example more quickly maybe I can
52:19 - ask chatgpt to optimize something that
52:21 - I've written
52:23 - um you know there might be some things
52:24 - in that direction that I think I could
52:27 - even imagine using right now
52:30 - um
52:33 - um so uh you know I think there's a lot
52:35 - more to say on it I do have a brief
52:37 - short that I have already recorded where
52:40 - I try to recreate one of my coding
52:42 - challenges with chat GPT
52:45 - um so that may or may not uh come out
52:47 - sometime soon okay
52:50 - um one of the things I found interesting
52:52 - about chat gbt there was somebody on
52:56 - Twitter who posted I'm already
52:58 - forgetting what the example is oh Pro
53:01 - you know ask chat gbt to make a star
53:03 - field simulation in p5.js and it spit
53:07 - out verbatim
53:09 - the code from one of my coding
53:11 - challenges so I
53:14 - um you know
53:15 - um so all right so let me uh how do I do
53:17 - this now I can say answered
53:19 - I mean you know the the thank you this
53:22 - is not really a question so I'm going to
53:23 - mark it as answered oh this was well
53:26 - addressed
53:27 - well addressed in this video I don't
53:29 - know if this is trolling me or just
53:31 - missed earlier in the video but this is
53:33 - a big year for me I will be turning 50.
53:36 - my brain by the way
53:38 - I don't there's I know there's a couple
53:40 - of you in the audience who are around my
53:41 - age I'm I'm really discovering
53:45 - that
53:47 - I my memory and my ability to recall
53:51 - certain words that I'm thinking of my my
53:55 - sort of quick-wittedness that nothing
53:58 - ever had it quick witness or declining
54:00 - so hopefully my streaming and videos
54:03 - will still be of of good quality can we
54:05 - get a C plus plus series probably not
54:08 - open Frameworks tutorials I mean I'd be
54:11 - happy to add that to the list
54:14 - but you know realistically with
54:16 - everything that I want to do
54:18 - that seems like it it's unlikely to
54:20 - happen and but
54:22 - you know I want to encourage people to
54:25 - use the way that I make videos to
54:27 - inspire them to make their own and maybe
54:29 - somebody will make some great
54:31 - um C plus plus videos
54:33 - uh welcome simic we're glad to see you
54:36 - here again
54:37 - um
54:38 - all right hello world is not a question
54:41 - answer this
54:43 - collab so first of all are does our
54:46 - fundraiser still going so let's plug
54:48 - something else here you know usually I'm
54:51 - always fundraising for the processing
54:53 - Foundation
54:55 - so somebody I don't know somebody
54:57 - mentioned school for poetic computation
54:59 - which Thrills me that somebody in the
55:00 - audience of the coding train would be
55:02 - familiar with them
55:03 - uh there's probably some good crossover
55:05 - there is a so sfbc is like to me a dream
55:10 - school you know I work at NYU I teach at
55:13 - NYU I am paid a salary I have health
55:16 - benefits
55:17 - I went to NYU I owe a lot I don't know
55:21 - if I owe a lot to NYU I mean I did pay
55:24 - off my student loans recently so I don't
55:27 - anymore well I never owed it to them
55:28 - anyway the point is I don't wanna I
55:31 - don't want to just I mean certainly
55:32 - don't want to disparage NYU but
55:35 - to me we have a huge problem especially
55:38 - in the U.S I know this isn't as much the
55:40 - case in other countries in higher
55:42 - education in terms of the expense
55:44 - in terms of the stress level for both
55:48 - the workers
55:49 - you know faculty are overworked
55:51 - administrators are overworked
55:54 - I mean some administrators may be
55:56 - overpaid some faculty are probably
55:58 - overpaid anyway I know that I can't get
56:00 - into all the ins and outs of this higher
56:03 - education in the U.S has many many many
56:05 - many many significant problems I would
56:08 - say the largest of which being it's
56:09 - inaccessibility to many people and this
56:12 - sort of like tiered system of elite
56:14 - universities and all that nonsense
56:16 - school for product computation is uh um
56:19 - a well I should uh just I shouldn't try
56:23 - to paraphrase I should read about it but
56:25 - it's independent uh
56:27 - experimental School interdisciplinary
56:30 - study and art code hardware and critical
56:32 - theory
56:33 - challenges the capitalistic
56:34 - heteronormative and patriarchal Canon of
56:37 - Social and Computer Sciences
56:39 - and uh you you I encourage you to read
56:43 - the mission statement the school has
56:45 - been around for quite a while but went
56:47 - through a lot of recent Transformations
56:50 - um so you know it is I I took a class I
56:54 - was able to take a class while in
56:55 - sabbatical from school for I took a
56:57 - class called learning to love
56:58 - mathematics which was absolutely
57:00 - fantastic totally would recommend it to
57:02 - everyone they do a lot of they they
57:04 - provide a lot of scholarship they're you
57:06 - know supported through their own tuition
57:08 - it's you know very Cooperative in its
57:10 - nature
57:11 - um so uh they're doing a fundraiser
57:15 - I'm just curious I think unfortunately
57:18 - the um
57:21 - train whistles that I donated are sold
57:23 - out
57:24 - but I'm just curious they're all these
57:26 - wonderful things in the I bought a lot
57:28 - of them a lot of the things in this
57:31 - um but if if you want to support sfbc
57:34 - you definitely should
57:36 - um
57:37 - let's just see ah here we go
57:40 - sadly the Cody train whistle and sticker
57:43 - pack are out of stock but you know you
57:45 - could get your whistle all in sticker
57:46 - pack by joining the coding train as a
57:48 - member they're really happening
57:51 - okay 2023 goal they're made we're just
57:55 - dealing with one a couple last things
57:56 - before we ship them let's let's go over
57:58 - I know I'm sorry that I'm jumping around
57:59 - all over the place but uh let's add here
58:05 - whistles
58:08 - two members
58:12 - so in 2023 the coding train I don't want
58:15 - to use the word canceled because it's
58:17 - such a loaded work I will cancel you're
58:19 - different if I don't get the whistles to
58:22 - the members who are at the membership
58:24 - level for the whistles in the year 2023
58:29 - I will cancel the coding train
58:32 - you're already here first so that's an
58:34 - absolute uh must
58:37 - hmm
58:39 - so anyway so back to the questions the
58:41 - reason why this game up is
58:44 - collab with school for oh uh collab with
58:48 - school for a poetic computation I mean I
58:50 - would love that I don't know what form
58:52 - that would be I'd like to support them
58:53 - so I don't know that they need me for
58:55 - anything but I um this is our
58:57 - collaboration I'm going to plug them uh
58:59 - take a look at what classes they're
59:00 - offering consider signing up considering
59:02 - joining them as a member making a
59:04 - donation uh all of that okay I think
59:10 - um I'm gonna answer that
59:13 - um okay so let's refresh oops
59:16 - I can't refresh the page
59:25 - um all right
59:28 - oh open this is
59:30 - Oh I thought I thought maybe it would
59:33 - make it go away if it's answered anyway
59:35 - all right
59:37 - um all right I'm gonna come back to more
59:38 - questions later
59:41 - um
59:43 - where are we
59:48 - where am I
59:53 - all right so uh let's go back over here
59:58 - so I'm going through what did I do in
60:01 - 2022
60:03 - what are my goals in 2023
60:07 - so we've got a few ideas for some coding
60:09 - challenges goal of 10 coding challenges
60:12 - let's talk about the Apple II Plus for a
60:14 - second
60:15 - so people really uh enjoyed the Apple 2
60:19 - plus videos uh they uh it just anecdote
60:22 - you know just sort of anecdotally I got
60:24 - a lot of positive feedback from them I'm
60:26 - looking over at the Apple II plus right
60:28 - here
60:29 - uh I don't know to what extent it makes
60:31 - sense to kind of like do the same thing
60:34 - over and over again but I'm running out
60:37 - of space here
60:39 - but um I'll just do my best let's
60:44 - so let's think of a couple things I
60:46 - might be able to do that would make
60:48 - sense to do as another Apple 2 plus
60:51 - video what I said in the last one that I
60:53 - was in two things on my mind are one is
60:56 - music
60:57 - sound so I think that's kind of
60:59 - interesting how that works and the other
61:02 - is
61:03 - 6502
61:05 - assembly so those are two things now
61:08 - this is not an apple II video
61:12 - but I happen to have gotten my hands a
61:15 - little holiday present for myself
61:17 - off of eBay and by the way I keep moving
61:20 - to the side because I have this monitor
61:22 - here it's really funny I have this
61:25 - monitor uh which is showing me what the
61:28 - camera is seeing but it doesn't really
61:30 - work and it's like the whole section of
61:32 - the pixels are just blacked out and if I
61:34 - stand right here I don't see my face at
61:36 - all so I keep moving to the side so they
61:38 - can see my face and then like it's
61:40 - making it very awkward anyway I should
61:42 - just look at it's also this camera is in
61:43 - the weirdest place it looks to me like
61:45 - the camera is pointing here
61:48 - anyway
61:49 - um I got myself off of eBay
61:52 - a computer called a
61:55 - commodore 64.
61:58 - so uh we are going to look at at some
62:01 - point in 2023 I'll put a star next to
62:05 - that like I might do that before these
62:07 - how about a video programming on the
62:09 - Commodore 64. does that interest you
62:12 - does that excite you how much of a
62:15 - priority should that be what what kinds
62:17 - of things here do you really want to see
62:20 - um okay so that's sort of retro so so
62:22 - retro computing
62:26 - um all right what are some other things
62:31 - uh
62:33 - what are some other things that I did in
62:37 - 20
62:38 - um
62:40 - 2022 let's go look at the live tab so
62:43 - let's just count how many live streams I
62:45 - did have a guest I had Dr Green uh I
62:47 - forgot that I guessed on them so this
62:49 - was last year's right I did a New Year's
62:52 - tell so I did a New Year's Telethon
62:54 - extravaganza
62:56 - um
62:57 - yeah I did have this look at that I
63:00 - don't remember this wallpaper okay
63:02 - um
63:03 - so let's look at this so let's just
63:05 - count the live streams one two
63:08 - three
63:09 - four five six
63:12 - oh this doesn't really count I mean it
63:14 - does sure does seven eight nine
63:16 - 10 11 12. so there were 12 oh no there
63:20 - were only 11 live streams now this isn't
63:23 - exactly true because
63:26 - um if I let me I don't know
63:29 - kind of lost track of how I was
63:31 - organizing this list
63:33 - but
63:36 - live
63:38 - there were what did I just say there
63:41 - were 11
63:43 - YouTube lives
63:45 - and then I also did a lot of
63:47 - experimenting with uh twitch and then
63:51 - also member
63:54 - only
63:56 - so let's see if I can I'm just curious I
63:59 - think that I have done a pretty good job
64:04 - uh sting I see your comment yes
64:08 - how many years have we been talking
64:10 - about this now
64:14 - um I forgot twitch exactly Simon
64:18 - um so if I do coding train twitch
64:20 - archive
64:23 - there is a YouTube channel little known
64:25 - YouTube channel
64:27 - that where I just well oh there's a lot
64:30 - of them whoa
64:33 - two years ago okay
64:35 - one two three four five six seven eight
64:40 - nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
64:44 - fifteen sixteen Seventeen so I did 17
64:47 - twitch streams
64:49 - that's a shocker now most of them are
64:52 - all January which is something I'm going
64:54 - to come to next
64:56 - because uh there is today is January 1st
64:58 - so January must be going on
65:02 - um so somehow
65:06 - not feeling better about this now
65:09 - I did 17 twitch streams
65:14 - that's a big question
65:16 - you know a lot of people did support me
65:18 - on Twitch whether they've signed up as a
65:20 - twitch subscriber I mean I think that's
65:22 - the main thing so uh you know I I in the
65:26 - same way that I'm exploring nebula as an
65:29 - alternative platform you know twitch to
65:32 - me feels like an interesting platform to
65:34 - explore Tick Tock is one your shorts is
65:38 - something I got to talk about at some
65:39 - point in this list
65:40 - but let's just just to do the accounting
65:43 - though I'm going to cure let me see if I
65:45 - can look at the members only
65:47 - um I'm just gonna go here because I
65:50 - gotta um look here under my I think if I
65:54 - go to
65:56 - I think if I go to
65:58 - um the coding train
66:00 - and if I go to
66:02 - playlists
66:05 - uh is there a how do I find the members
66:08 - only playlist
66:10 - I think it's like
66:12 - it's a thing that automatically is
66:16 - oh yeah here it is
66:19 - members only content did I make this or
66:23 - is this
66:25 - happening automatically anyway I don't
66:27 - think I'm going to be able to count
66:28 - these right now I'll just show you what
66:30 - I'm looking at
66:31 - so because there's
66:33 - um basically often for those of you who
66:35 - might be interested in signing up as a
66:37 - YouTube member uh where which supports
66:40 - the coding train you can get access to
66:42 - some channels in Discord I will often
66:45 - stream uh a recording session so if I'm
66:49 - recording something oh somebody just
66:51 - gifted a whole bunch of memberships
66:53 - five who oh Leonardo Joe Joe PS
66:59 - gifted five coding train memberships wow
67:03 - that's very generous of you so all of
67:05 - you are about who just got those gifted
67:08 - are about to have unlocked these old I
67:12 - don't know how interesting these would
67:13 - be to go back and watch but for a lot of
67:15 - the tutorial videos that I release I
67:17 - record them I you know it's a three hour
67:19 - session of maybe why I recorded a 20
67:21 - minute video but I I live stream those
67:23 - and let people tune in it's helpful to
67:25 - have a little bit of feedback but
67:27 - um I don't they're not public live
67:28 - streams because
67:30 - having it not be a public live stream
67:32 - allows me to sort of not worry about a
67:34 - whole lot of details uh and just kind of
67:37 - focus on what I'm trying to do which is
67:39 - make the content but it's helpful to
67:40 - have a bit of an audience so if that's
67:41 - something that interests you
67:43 - um there's there's a way on YouTube for
67:47 - me to find I think this uh
67:50 - all of the members only videos I'm
67:52 - pretty sure though this playlist
67:54 - is one that I made so it doesn't really
67:58 - count
68:01 - I don't I don't know how to find it but
68:03 - I'm not going to worry about that
68:04 - there's a bunch of them I could try to
68:06 - count them I'll figure it figure them
68:08 - out there were a ton of January streams
68:11 - yeah that's because that was a big thing
68:12 - I was doing last year okay
68:15 - um okay so members only that's a thing
68:17 - we'll just put a big
68:19 - uh
68:21 - uh question mark here
68:24 - so
68:26 - you know I'm tempted to put a poll up
68:29 - in the YouTube chat here to ask people
68:31 - if I should continue streaming on Twitch
68:33 - but I feel like asking that question to
68:36 - a YouTube live stream audience is not
68:39 - it's not the way to do it so
68:43 - uh come back I'll come back to that but
68:46 - that is
68:47 - that is a question let's just put over
68:49 - here
68:51 - a lot let's put this here live
68:58 - twitch
69:01 - member
69:03 - so what do I I know this is completely
69:07 - illegible
69:09 - looks like I'm about to say do like
69:11 - flutter tutorials or something but this
69:13 - is kind of where I am
69:16 - that's a question for for 2022. I mean I
69:20 - always have this question part of me
69:22 - and I don't think I want to do this but
69:24 - part of me always thinks maybe I should
69:27 - just only live stream I just got a
69:30 - notification on Discord so maybe I
69:32 - should only live stream my life would be
69:34 - so much simpler
69:35 - I could just live stream once a week at
69:38 - a certain time pick a topic go over it
69:40 - move on
69:42 - but I really do like having these videos
69:45 - the live streams don't really
69:48 - they don't stand the test of time and I
69:51 - my goal for the coding train is to be a
69:54 - channel you know I know I'm saying
69:56 - Evergreen content is ever going to be
69:58 - accurate but I want people if they're
70:00 - looking for wave function collapse they
70:02 - can just find the video on that if it's
70:04 - buried inside of like a live stream
70:06 - where I'm doing 15 different things so
70:08 - anyway so I'm not there yet but
70:09 - sometimes and also like now I've been
70:12 - now I've got a whole bunch of people
70:13 - working on you know editing and
70:15 - animations and things for the video so I
70:17 - don't want to suddenly you know not give
70:19 - them anything to do so um so uh I I do
70:23 - really like having the videos
70:25 - uh uh I I like doing all the things so I
70:29 - like live streaming I like having the
70:30 - videos edited and produced
70:32 - all that stuff okay
70:35 - uh
70:36 - um let's take a look at January
70:40 - let me come back to January all right
70:42 - let's take a peek at the chat here
70:45 - um
70:48 - okay so we are going over
70:56 - things done in 2022
71:00 - uh chat suggestion
71:03 - oh Chris Manning for 2020 is there a way
71:06 - for Outsiders to throw their hat in the
71:08 - ring maybe a quick email with
71:10 - qualifications and an idea for a guest
71:12 - video
71:13 - yeah this is a great question
71:16 - um oh and I see it there
71:19 - um
71:21 - yeah I mean
71:23 - I had sort of thought sometimes
71:27 - in a long term kind of way like is there
71:31 - a path
71:33 - could the coding train be a network
71:37 - of people
71:39 - and have multiple you know is it
71:41 - multiple channels uh is it multiple
71:45 - hosts is it different people and I've
71:48 - kind of wanted that and I've done a lot
71:50 - of stuff with guests um mostly my the
71:54 - two sort of
71:56 - paths that I've had for guests are one
72:00 - finding interesting artists
72:04 - and people who aren't on YouTube to come
72:07 - and talk about their work uh I also did
72:12 - a series uh which was curated by PSY X
72:17 - when they were the coding trained
72:18 - Community manager that was featuring
72:21 - black voices in Tech
72:24 - um so you know certainly for me thinking
72:26 - about using the coding train platform to
72:30 - shine a light on creators from diverse
72:35 - communities I think is important and
72:38 - something that I would like to do more
72:40 - of
72:41 - um so I don't know
72:46 - a having guessed is a true is much more
72:49 - work than I think it is so I don't know
72:52 - what to do about guests
72:55 - um but my in my Ideal World
73:00 - I think I would love to be able to have
73:02 - a system to feature the work of others
73:06 - on the coding train and have people
73:08 - happy guests maybe one of the maybe a
73:11 - way to do that is to have
73:15 - more guests for less time so like what
73:19 - would it mean for a guest to appear on
73:21 - the coding train for 10 minutes and be
73:24 - able to be remote
73:26 - um so uh this is something that I think
73:29 - that for me to be able to execute
73:31 - effectively it needs to be something
73:33 - that I hire somebody to produce
73:35 - basically to do the work of wrangling
73:39 - the guests curating the guests
73:41 - scheduling the things all of that stuff
73:44 - um so something I can talk with Katie
73:47 - about who's running the coding train
73:48 - social media to see if if she's
73:50 - interested or maybe this is something
73:52 - that um somebody already is working on
73:54 - something recording train or somebody in
73:56 - the audience right now might be
73:57 - interested in helping so I think if I'm
74:00 - going to do more with guests I need uh I
74:04 - need someone to sort of be have that be
74:07 - their project and kind of keep me in
74:09 - line here I found myself to be more
74:12 - disorganized in 22 than any other year
74:14 - of my life and I don't know I'm a little
74:17 - I always thought I was like a very
74:19 - organized on top of my to-do list kind
74:21 - of person and I'm not anymore I have had
74:24 - more emails that I failed to mention
74:27 - people I forgot to call back things that
74:29 - I didn't follow up on in 2022 that any
74:31 - other year and I don't know if that's
74:32 - just how it's going to be for me for the
74:34 - rest of my life or if 2022 was sort of
74:36 - an anomaly well she'll see
74:38 - okay
74:42 - um
74:46 - I'm staring right here at a huge
74:49 - accomplishment in 2022 which is the new
74:52 - coding Train website
74:54 - so
74:56 - I'm going to put that here under oh
74:58 - sorry I didn't press the button
75:00 - I mean that should get its own category
75:02 - for
75:04 - um so I'm kind of at the bottom here
75:08 - uh coding train
75:14 - website
75:16 - so
75:18 - launch but one thing that I didn't do is
75:23 - make a video about it that's been on my
75:25 - list forever so
75:31 - um
75:32 - where to put that
75:35 - I'll put that here
75:37 - other under other
75:42 - coding Train website
75:45 - video like this I imagine being
75:48 - a 10 minute video that just says in 2022
75:53 - the new coding Train website launched
75:55 - these are the different parts of the
75:57 - website this is how you this is the
76:00 - passenger showcase this is how you
76:01 - contribute to it thank you to all of
76:04 - these people who have done all this work
76:05 - on the website that kind of stuff so
76:08 - this is a big star
76:10 - because this is a must I feel like
76:12 - things that are a must are
76:14 - so far
76:16 - whistles to members
76:19 - I guess I should use like a different
76:21 - color what if I do like red
76:27 - coding Train website video
76:30 - uh whistles to members these are things
76:32 - that are a must I mean
76:34 - is wave function collapse an overlapping
76:36 - model bottle a must I think so but I'm
76:39 - not I hesitate to to use this red star
76:42 - just yet
76:43 - okay so that was a big accomplishment in
76:47 - 2022
76:49 - looking at the list to think of other
76:51 - types of things
76:53 - uh that I want to do we've got to talk
76:55 - about nature of code
76:58 - I want to talk about these
77:00 - uh which leads me to the Oregon Trail
77:03 - project
77:04 - okay
77:05 - so let's come back let's go to I
77:10 - I can't believe that I'm about to do
77:12 - this but I am going to open up the
77:14 - Twitter application
77:17 - so we are not done with the questions
77:19 - we'll come back to the questions
77:22 - if you need to sign off of this live
77:24 - stream and go away and come back in
77:26 - about 10 minutes I fully understand
77:28 - warning
77:31 - trigger warning content warning I am
77:34 - opening up the healthscape that is
77:36 - twitter.com right now I am going to
77:39 - immediately go to slash schiffman
77:43 - and I also am going to make it oh let's
77:46 - close this okay my
77:49 - direct messages came up briefly that's
77:51 - fine
77:52 - sorry dragon's lore I understand the
77:55 - mess that is that board and how diagonal
77:57 - it is anything I could do to improve
77:59 - your viewing of it I would be glad
78:02 - redoing old videos is definitely on the
78:05 - list there Anusha to come back to talk
78:07 - about Okay so
78:09 - I want to scroll back through my Twitter
78:13 - timeline let's see if we can get to
78:15 - January
78:17 - first 2021 honestly like Twitter is the
78:22 - basically the only social media platform
78:24 - besides YouTube which is also social
78:26 - media platform that I actually use so I
78:29 - think we can discover
78:30 - oh my God I'm only at October
78:33 - we can discover a lot of things that
78:36 - I've done and things that I should
78:37 - follow up on
78:39 - by scrolling through the Twitter
78:41 - timeline
78:43 - if you don't mind
78:45 - just waiting for me to get
78:49 - through
78:50 - all the way to I'm in July
78:53 - halfway there
78:58 - um because I think there are many a
79:01 - thing here
79:03 - that
79:06 - um
79:11 - where are we may
79:16 - that I will discover that I accomplished
79:19 - and or that I want to do more um do more
79:23 - on in 2023.
79:27 - okay a lot of these are retweets of
79:30 - other people's wonderful work so that is
79:32 - less relevant to what I'm talking about
79:34 - today okay keep going
79:40 - all right a lot of severance content
79:42 - here on my Twitter no surprise
79:46 - all right so let's
79:49 - go back year in the life
79:52 - we're in February we're almost there
79:54 - everybody
79:56 - oh 2022.
79:59 - what are you what are we at 120 okay
80:02 - all right because I wanted to do the
80:03 - January challenge today whatever the
80:06 - January topic is before I go so I I this
80:08 - could go on forever I'm gonna try to
80:10 - wrap up in the next 10 to 20 minutes so
80:12 - I can do some coding today okay January
80:15 - 27th
80:18 - I did all these projects with January
80:20 - which was kind of fun
80:23 - and I think my idea was I was going to
80:25 - turn them into coding challenges and I
80:27 - never actually did
80:29 - uh January 11th Twitter is my Twitter
80:32 - was most active last January so if
80:34 - you're not from let's let's look up
80:35 - January
80:37 - let's get to January 1st
80:40 - um
80:42 - yeah Donna this I wanted to make a
80:44 - coding challenge
80:45 - I really wanted to do this as a coding
80:47 - challenge video okay let's see
80:50 - uh January 1st okay
80:53 - right so December 30th I did my
80:58 - Cody train processing Telethon you
81:01 - should donate to the processing there's
81:02 - no official Telethon this year all right
81:05 - and now we're at January 1st 2022. so
81:09 - what is January
81:13 - January is a artificially generated
81:16 - month of time where we at a community of
81:19 - people build code that makes beautiful
81:21 - things
81:24 - um It's Made of hashtags January you can
81:26 - do January 1 you can do January 2023
81:29 - there are prompts
81:30 - uh we could probably just get chat GPT
81:33 - to do it for today and the first prompt
81:36 - is perfect perfect Loop envelope now I
81:40 - don't know that I'm going to do January
81:42 - this year last year I was like I'm on
81:45 - the start of my sabbatical I'm going to
81:47 - code a creative project every day I
81:50 - could do it it was a different time this
81:52 - year I gotta prepare my syllabi do a lot
81:55 - of other things but I think we can get
81:57 - started
81:58 - um but let's at least last year kind of
82:01 - scroll through last year's January just
82:03 - just pick out some things so this was my
82:06 - first one
82:08 - um a thousand squares I forgot what the
82:10 - prompt was ten thousand squares uh
82:14 - dithering maybe was one oh yes so this
82:19 - what is this called
82:22 - um
82:24 - there's a name for this and and uh
82:28 - I guess this
82:32 - dithering is the name but I
82:35 - Lloyd's algorithm
82:38 - the right was Accords algorithms the
82:41 - court so all right so let's put on the
82:43 - coding challenge list
82:45 - this is a really interesting algorithm
82:47 - and I would like to do it as a video
82:49 - there's a lot of potential to it for
82:52 - Creative twists so I'm just going to
82:54 - write down secord's algorithm
82:57 - and hopefully that will remind me
83:01 - so these are currently our sort of
83:04 - running list of coding challenge ideas
83:09 - for 2023
83:13 - um
83:16 - right I was streaming on Twitch uh this
83:19 - was my first space nature of code I've
83:21 - got to talk about this was my variation
83:23 - on fidenze
83:26 - um which is a wonderful work by Tyler
83:29 - Hobbs
83:30 - uh retweeting some other cool stuff
83:33 - Square again this actually was really
83:35 - kind of fun I trained degenerative
83:37 - adversarial Network just on images of
83:39 - squares
83:42 - um
83:42 - other people's amazing work that I'm
83:45 - retweeting
83:48 - uh this is my variation on a Casey Reese
83:52 - style work
83:54 - [Music]
83:55 - um
83:57 - okay there's more challenge suggestions
84:00 - Tetris
84:01 - yes yes yes Tetris I should definitely
84:04 - do
84:05 - some other stuff that I did saw the wit
84:07 - I'm gonna scroll through this stuff
84:08 - quickly now just seeing uh this I loved
84:11 - I don't remember what kind of weirdness
84:13 - oh yeah I was going to do this as a
84:15 - coding challenge like generative
84:17 - cityscape
84:20 - I forgot that I did all these oh no
84:22 - somebody else did the that I did all
84:24 - these live streaming
84:26 - um no computer I did some kind of weird
84:28 - song thing
84:30 - polar coordinates
84:35 - uh
84:37 - this would be good for a short by the
84:39 - way to do a YouTube short on just
84:43 - uh
84:45 - Universal distribution of
84:49 - random
84:52 - more about prime this sand Falling Sand
84:58 - is a cool idea for a coding challenge
85:03 - I'm I'm writing it over here without
85:05 - switching back to the Whiteboard
85:08 - Falling Sand
85:12 - that's a kind of interesting idea for a
85:14 - coding challenge
85:17 - um
85:20 - more weird things oh yeah aikida map
85:24 - this is like a cool one I mean I was
85:30 - uh needs more cheese Ikea I mean does it
85:33 - make sense it is a coding challenge is
85:35 - does that just become like a YouTube
85:37 - short but these are good I mean these
85:39 - were meant to be last year and I never
85:41 - did them because I mean I did them
85:44 - that never followed through on it but
85:48 - actually having a year off from it
85:49 - probably makes the most sense VHS
85:54 - um
85:56 - uh
85:57 - uh text typography
86:00 - um
86:01 - this was kind of fun
86:03 - uh or just where are we where are we in
86:07 - day 23 most of this stuff is just stuff
86:09 - that I've done before Mandel bulb okay I
86:12 - did that that actually became a video
86:15 - or uh
86:17 - twitch Tuesday remember that everyone
86:19 - that was a funny idea uh oh I loved this
86:23 - this is what led me to like the Apple II
86:25 - stuff in some way like this apple II
86:28 - racer game that was fun to make
86:32 - um
86:33 - okay
86:35 - uh
86:37 - more with some star patterns
86:41 - oh yeah this this this I enjoyed which
86:43 - was like running my slide puzzle thing
86:46 - backwards
86:48 - so that
86:50 - I think when it's done it makes a
86:52 - pattern right yeah just organizes it
86:55 - okay
86:56 - um
86:58 - self-portrait day 28
87:02 - uh okay
87:05 - organic looking output this is a like
87:07 - flocking simulation this is weird that
87:10 - one was a weird
87:12 - uh okay
87:14 - okay all right so now
87:17 - another new thing is uh welcoming Bernie
87:20 - who has been working on the YouTube
87:22 - shorts and has made some interesting uh
87:25 - trailers and different things for the
87:27 - coding train
87:29 - um there's a lot of Runway retweets I
87:32 - made a Wordle box
87:34 - let's try to play zillions of games of
87:36 - Wordle in different algorithms three
87:38 - blue one Brown beat me to making an
87:42 - amazing video on that way further along
87:44 - than anything I could have done
87:46 - um okay here's something we got to
87:48 - address
87:52 - where's my uh
87:54 - there's a very specific sound effect
87:56 - that I need for this
87:57 - [Music]
88:01 - I'd like to put something out into the
88:03 - universe the second edition of the
88:05 - nature of code will be available for
88:07 - free download at the natureofgo.com and
88:10 - for purchase and print by the 10th
88:11 - anniversary of its original publication
88:16 - this did not happen
88:18 - and I also just safely remember saying
88:20 - if I don't get it done by this date
88:22 - forget about it I'm giving up on the
88:25 - project
88:26 - so if you will all have a little Grace
88:29 - with me give me a little bit of
88:32 - um
88:34 - Give Me Your Grace
88:36 - be kind allow me to go back on my word
88:41 - and what I would like to say is while I
88:44 - didn't make this deadline
88:48 - I made progress
88:51 - and I have a lot of momentum
88:54 - and in fact
88:57 - if you go to right now
88:59 - github.com
89:01 - nature of code
89:05 - and go to book website second edition
89:10 - and if I go to insights
89:17 - um
89:25 - commits is what I'm looking for and I
89:27 - guess it's got to Crunch the numbers
89:29 - here hang tight but
89:32 - um 23 I obviously meant 2032 yeah uh I
89:36 - was going to just show there's like been
89:37 - a lot of commits in work and activity
89:39 - but the that's less important than
89:42 - actually showing you
89:45 - um
89:46 - so you can read the documentation about
89:48 - the new system for building the book
89:50 - there are even new illustrations I don't
89:54 - know why I don't have the link to the
89:56 - preview of it there's a whole preview
89:59 - which could go which is on netlify which
90:02 - I guess if I go to
90:10 - now just bear with me for a second let
90:12 - me find this link
90:13 - by logging into netlify
90:18 - ah sorry I have to two Factor
90:25 - fractal Flame
90:31 - hold on hold on everybody
90:36 - do you hear that fly buzzing around
90:40 - all right so
90:42 - netlify has been a big accomplishment
90:44 - for me in 2022 which is now I deploy
90:48 - sites through netlify now the five if
90:51 - you want to sponsor the coding train hit
90:53 - me up
90:54 - um
90:56 - but
90:57 - um so the Oregon Trail project is
90:59 - something I have to talk about Cody
91:00 - train new website but let's go to here
91:04 - oh how do I there we go and go to here
91:08 - and you can actually see
91:10 - this you this does not this does not go
91:13 - anywhere yet you cannot buy the book yet
91:14 - there's no donate button or anything but
91:17 - for example if I go to the vectors
91:19 - chapter you can see there is a rewrite
91:22 - of this chapter
91:24 - there are the actual code examples
91:27 - running on the page and if I click open
91:30 - in the web editor I get to the code
91:33 - example running in the web editor
91:37 - there's a new design
91:39 - there are new illustrations
91:43 - in a new style
91:45 - uh you can see that the book is here
91:47 - it's been updated to p5.js most of these
91:51 - chapters uh some of the late that's a
91:53 - layout mistake
91:55 - um the math formulas work there let me
91:57 - just see even at the end if there's like
92:00 - there's a whole new uh there's a whole
92:03 - new illustration style for this sort of
92:05 - like ecosystem project
92:07 - um you can see this like cool table of
92:09 - contents here on the right that I can
92:11 - get around I can go to the particle
92:13 - systems chapter and I can start reading
92:15 - the particles of the chapter so it's
92:16 - here
92:18 - work has been happening
92:21 - um
92:21 - so uh I'm thrilled to say that there is
92:25 - immense progress and momentum so I don't
92:27 - want to kill the project even though I
92:29 - didn't make my deadline I also I mean I
92:32 - don't think I'm ready to announce this
92:33 - yet but I am um and you can see some of
92:35 - these haven't been updated yet I think I
92:38 - will be working with a publisher to get
92:40 - the print version out
92:42 - um in higher quality uh and distributed
92:45 - through more channels uh it's all the
92:48 - while keeping the book for free online
92:51 - the entirety of the book for free online
92:52 - so there is a lot of to come this goes
92:56 - here top priority
92:59 - I'm going to put it
93:01 - just directly over here
93:04 - NOC book The other reason why I cannot
93:08 - kill this project
93:09 - and it's definitely going to get the red
93:11 - star
93:16 - guess what's going to really help this
93:18 - project
93:20 - I am teaching at New York University
93:23 - again this spring
93:25 - an undergraduate class a graduate class
93:29 - each with some number of students
93:31 - already enrolled in it it runs for 14
93:34 - weeks it meets every week for hours at a
93:37 - time guess what the topic of both
93:39 - classes is the topic is the nature of
93:44 - code so I will be required to teach the
93:47 - nature of code every week to a classroom
93:49 - full of students not once but twice so
93:51 - what will I be working on every week
93:53 - preparing material for the nature of
93:54 - code which will get me to work on the
93:56 - nature of code book so my new deadline
93:58 - just let me finish it by the end of the
94:00 - semester
94:02 - it's gonna happen folks
94:05 - 2032 I mean it's a joke running joke at
94:07 - this point I don't care
94:09 - 2023 that is a huge goal there was gold
94:14 - star did not meet my deadline but
94:17 - accomplishments were made
94:19 - um again a lot of people offered to help
94:21 - with the book right now there's not much
94:25 - that I can say that is obvious of like
94:29 - how I how you could help
94:32 - but
94:34 - um certainly just cheering me on joining
94:37 - the coding train as a member actually I
94:39 - turned on GitHub sponsor this you really
94:41 - want to like as a like place for
94:44 - supporting the nature of code book I
94:46 - think I put it on those repos so that's
94:48 - one way you could support but just
94:49 - honestly just telling me that the book
94:51 - means something to you and you're
94:53 - excited to the second edition and you
94:55 - know you'll buy it if you can like
94:57 - that'll keep me going so stay in touch
94:59 - about it uh data of code book okay we've
95:02 - covered that
95:09 - um all right so we're back going back to
95:11 - Twitter I I want to get through
95:12 - scrolling through Twitter and then I
95:14 - think I mean this this could go on
95:16 - forever I I want to talk about a couple
95:18 - of things
95:21 - um I'm just looking through Prime spiral
95:25 - oh I was really using the wheel last
95:27 - year
95:29 - the cutting train the history of the
95:32 - cutting train is me starting with a plan
95:35 - and not following up on that plan sorry
95:38 - everybody uh ASCII challenge
95:42 - uh
95:46 - this shouldn't take too long I'm in
95:47 - February already
95:49 - just looking for anything
95:51 - that I want to make sure
95:55 - that I address
96:02 - oh yeah this is pretty funny
96:06 - I love this tweet okay
96:09 - um just to say what this is this is
96:13 - me
96:14 - watching me watching me again and you
96:17 - can just see like and look now like oh
96:20 - now we've got it like here
96:22 - you can all
96:26 - you can all screenshot this now
96:32 - or we can screenshot this and share this
96:35 - all over it look look at the gray I mean
96:38 - look at how much gray there is now
96:41 - people that's why I used to I used to
96:43 - get like you know
96:45 - I was getting older folks but my energy
96:49 - is still here right my smile won't go
96:52 - away
96:53 - um all right that was kind of amazing
96:55 - all right keep going Prime spiral
96:57 - uh
96:59 - um
97:00 - uh
97:01 - um we did uh we feature for Black
97:04 - History Month we featured a lot of uh uh
97:06 - people uh black creators and
97:08 - technologists processing four that was
97:11 - nice that was great
97:13 - um
97:15 - uh let's see what else is going on Pi
97:18 - Day happened
97:20 - Mandel bulbs happened
97:23 - uh um
97:28 - um
97:31 - um
97:34 - what quad tree stuff happened
97:38 - ah yes
97:40 - MDR Lumen so Severance I mean
97:46 - but really I'm running I'm I'm quickly
97:48 - running out of energy here and my brain
97:51 - is uh melting
97:55 - I would like to work on this Severance
97:57 - Pro so
97:59 - let's
98:01 - not not to be specifically about
98:03 - Severance but if I go back to the
98:04 - Whiteboard for a second
98:07 - uh sorry I have to sneeze do I have any
98:10 - tissues
98:11 - in this room
98:13 - I don't think I do
98:17 - that's you
98:22 - I'll have to find the kleenex let's see
98:26 - let's see how far this wireless mic oh
98:27 - here's some oh it's cold in here
98:31 - okay
98:36 - I should probably mute myself
98:41 - everybody
98:42 - I'm going to blow my nose I have not
98:45 - muted my microphone please enjoy
98:52 - amazing wow I feel like a new man okay
98:58 - I like to work on
99:00 - useless weird software projects for
99:03 - entertainment purposes only
99:07 - and
99:10 - one of them is oh and you can't see that
99:13 - probably
99:15 - oh yes if I turn there we go okay this
99:18 - is only going to make things worse but
99:20 - um so I would like to work on
99:25 - MDR
99:27 - uh in conjunction with my working titles
99:33 - video
99:34 - maybe I would make a video on that so
99:36 - that I would like to do more of in 2023
99:38 - uh if you don't know what I'm talking
99:40 - about that's fine we're getting it's
99:43 - I've been I'm an hour and 40 minutes
99:45 - into this live stream
99:47 - uh you people want to know more about
99:50 - that add it to the online questions
99:52 - thing but the reason why I'm remembering
99:54 - this is
99:57 - I am working on a version of the Oregon
100:01 - Trail
100:03 - this
100:05 - may come as somewhat of something of a
100:07 - shock to you
100:10 - what did I just do to uh but um that's
100:15 - going to get a red star because it's
100:16 - something I've committed to
100:19 - um
100:22 - basically I to make a long story short
100:27 - Oregon Trail is a game from the 80s
100:30 - possibly maybe it was actually made
100:32 - earlier in the 70s there was a version
100:34 - for it for the Apple II I played through
100:37 - it during the live stream I started
100:40 - trying to make a p5.js sort of like
100:43 - authentic uh uh replica Port of it
100:47 - it's not an emulator but just trying to
100:51 - make something that has the same exact
100:52 - look and feel of the game in p5.js
100:56 - uh just because I'm interested in trying
100:57 - to do that but the reason is there's a
101:00 - podcast I listened to called run app
101:03 - r-a-a-n-a-p
101:06 - you have no idea what I'm talking about
101:08 - that's fine you probably shouldn't where
101:12 - they played through the Oregon Trail as
101:14 - part of the podcast and uh I have
101:18 - committed to making a version of the
101:20 - game that is telling the story of the
101:23 - podcast instead of the Oregon Trail that
101:25 - they'll play through on an episode so I
101:28 - gotta make the I gotta work on that
101:31 - this is very important to me
101:33 - so that's on my list for 2023 and maybe
101:36 - I can make a video about it I mean
101:38 - that's also kind of an ongoing question
101:39 - in my head is to what extent should like
101:43 - for this project would people be
101:45 - interested in a kind of like scripted
101:48 - explainer video I don't I typically
101:51 - haven't done this on YouTube but like a
101:53 - project like this it took a very long
101:55 - time to build
101:56 - it's not really going to fit into like a
101:58 - coding challenge video first of all I'm
102:00 - going to rebuild the whole thing step by
102:01 - step no I already made it but I could
102:03 - make a video that describes what this
102:06 - project is how it works uh you know
102:09 - interesting sort of like coding tidbits
102:11 - about little techniques that are inside
102:13 - there tell the story of it you know
102:15 - something more along the lines of what
102:17 - Sebastian lag does I'm not saying I
102:18 - could do it nearly as well but that's a
102:21 - question so that that is kind of like
102:24 - um if I go back to the Whiteboard like
102:27 - for projects like this
102:29 - you know explainer video
102:36 - is that something that I want to
102:38 - consider doing it could even be like
102:40 - total voiceover
102:41 - not really my style but that is kind of
102:44 - a style of YouTube
102:46 - um thinking about it
102:47 - okay
102:51 - scrolling through
102:52 - we are in March
102:57 - um this was
102:59 - this is what I would I would
103:01 - characterize this to one of my fail
103:02 - failures I really always wanted to do I
103:06 - Love Phil Hartman's anal retentive Chef
103:08 - old-time Live sketch tried to make my
103:10 - own version of it called the anal
103:11 - retentive coder I think a few people
103:13 - found this really funny and fun but most
103:15 - people just either didn't like it it
103:17 - didn't want didn't definitely did not
103:18 - catch the YouTube algorithm
103:21 - um but um
103:24 - uh there you go uh
103:28 - okay uh maybe I'll maybe I'll think of
103:31 - something for April fools this year
103:32 - maybe not I was on a billboard
103:36 - [Music]
103:37 - um
103:39 - a lot of stuff about this project a lot
103:42 - of severance stuff oh the Apple II
103:44 - arrived
103:45 - so that happened in April last year uh
103:48 - this this is pretty funny
103:58 - this was
104:00 - me for the first day I turned it on
104:12 - did you all hear that
104:15 - and there's smoke
104:22 - oh
104:23 - so that led me to
104:27 - oh this is a nice time lapse of me
104:30 - unboxing the Apple II
104:33 - uh um
104:37 - but that led me to working on fixing up
104:40 - the Apple II computer
104:42 - uh
104:44 - uh all right that you know whole new
104:46 - studio
104:48 - uh uur bot was a new bot that I released
104:52 - also related to Severance I would like
104:54 - to do more about with that
104:58 - um wave function collapse
105:01 - uh
105:07 - scrolling through what am I a lot of
105:10 - interesting Runway stuff or wave
105:13 - function collapse
105:17 - um
105:18 - some other things I'm promoting other
105:20 - people's great work
105:23 - all right that's the question I really
105:25 - want to do Twitter bot
105:27 - um oh I got to make a list of tutorials
105:29 - oh dear the Discord bot
105:31 - um I really wanted to do so let's
105:34 - as I come up with things let me go back
105:36 - so I also want to make a list now of
105:42 - tutorials
105:46 - so I think it would make sense to that
105:49 - the things that are on my mind are more
105:52 - NOC
105:54 - that I imagine making more nature of
105:56 - code videos as I am
106:00 - um
106:02 - um as I am teaching the class
106:06 - um processing
106:08 - for intro series
106:13 - Discord bot tutorial
106:17 - and
106:19 - um
106:22 - uh redo p5.js
106:28 - and then there's a question of whether I
106:31 - should you know there's sort of this
106:32 - like ml5 and like um
106:37 - like do like um do I want to do text
106:40 - generative AI
106:43 - with generative AI tutorials these are
106:46 - that's kind of like a list of things I
106:47 - might like to do uh like General like
106:50 - basically generative AI tutorials I
106:52 - imagine being more things like oh how do
106:55 - you take a model that's hosted on
106:57 - something like hugging face and access
106:59 - it in your p5.js sketch that's kind of
107:01 - what I'm thinking of for those
107:04 - um
107:06 - okay
107:07 - uh to Twitter okay so back to here
107:11 - uh
107:13 - we caught weak COC was there for the
107:15 - computer live burning okay so I I was on
107:21 - um
107:23 - uh Raphael's stream
107:25 - I don't think there's a lot of wave
107:27 - function collapse
107:30 - um
107:31 - right we can see
107:33 - here
107:36 - more stuff
107:40 - um
107:44 - maybe a class is launched
107:47 - a local storage video
107:51 - um
107:53 - I'm almost done I think with everything
107:56 - I wanted to go over today there was an
107:57 - ITP show
107:59 - summer happened
108:03 - um
108:04 - if I see is there something important I
108:06 - should under Monty Hall problem I did
108:08 - that video
108:10 - uh
108:11 - [Music]
108:15 - uh so I tried to fix the Apple II Plus
108:20 - uh oh I went to Copenhagen yay
108:24 - Copenhagen
108:27 - uh that was awesome where where will I
108:31 - go this year
108:33 - I like to go somewhere and to some
108:36 - processing Community Day Japan any
108:39 - viewers in Japan invite me to Japan
108:40 - that's where I'm going that's a that's
108:42 - on my my next list of a place I really
108:44 - want to go to that maybe I can make
108:46 - happen this year
108:48 - um
108:51 - uh okay
108:54 - uh
108:56 - So speaking which this is me with Cheryl
108:59 - the coconut if anybody knows what Charo
109:02 - the coconut is then to you you probably
109:06 - already subscribed to nebula
109:10 - new website
109:12 - there was a train was like the weekly
109:16 - challenge
109:18 - uh
109:20 - Bernie I met Bernie in person in
109:22 - Copenhagen
109:25 - Copenhagen is tomorrow
109:29 - people
109:31 - they were so great I had such a good
109:33 - time
109:35 - I want to go back to Copenhagen and
109:37 - there's me and Copenhagen
109:40 - and Stig we're wearing flower shirts
109:45 - um then I took a pilgrimage to the super
109:47 - Ellis it's circled stork I went to
109:50 - Sweden
109:51 - that was awesome I got covered that was
109:54 - no fun
109:56 - uh um okay where what else what else is
109:59 - happening here
110:01 - uh uh yes uh did the collaboration with
110:04 - Grady from practical engineering if you
110:06 - don't know practical engineering the
110:07 - channel is awesome I also got to meet
110:09 - Grady in person at educon that was great
110:12 - thank you for indulging me I'm just kind
110:14 - of going through my year we're just
110:17 - getting close to being done
110:22 - um
110:23 - there was Google summer of code
110:26 - uh all these wonderful stickers
110:29 - Christian Dr Christian hubicki we did
110:32 - robot controller so this could be a nice
110:37 - the PID controller could be a really
110:40 - nice
110:41 - um
110:42 - coding Challenge video
110:47 - p i d controller
110:51 - and that would fit really well with
110:54 - nature of code because I'm rewriting the
110:56 - nature of code chapter the physics
110:59 - Library chapter to use matter.js and I
111:02 - used matter.js in this example I could
111:04 - bring those together in a coding
111:05 - challenge video that would be great
111:07 - so let's put that on the list
111:12 - and you can see the result of it here
111:16 - this was like a really fun project to
111:18 - work on
111:20 - where basically the controller
111:23 - balances of balances this uh uh upside
111:27 - down pendulum and I can change the two
111:29 - different parameters here the P gain or
111:32 - the D gain uh to look at how that's done
111:37 - um
111:38 - so I will I would love to revisit that I
111:41 - got obsessed with corgis I mean I'm
111:44 - already obsessed with corgis but
111:45 - generative corgis
111:47 - there was mini dolly for a while
111:50 - uh that was a thing look at all
111:55 - Corgi images
111:58 - uh phase
112:01 - um there's schifferpal which is a color
112:03 - that's just dedicated to me I guess
112:04 - which is pretty cool
112:06 - okay again this
112:08 - just reminding me about how this did not
112:11 - happen but I already covered this
112:13 - um
112:15 - ah by the way so uh foreign is a great
112:18 - Creator
112:19 - um on nebula and this is
112:23 - um
112:25 - uh one of the reasons why you know maybe
112:28 - the anal retentive coder would have done
112:30 - well in nebula
112:31 - um but you know sometimes disgusting
112:33 - race
112:34 - um
112:36 - can videos can be demonetized for
112:39 - different kinds of reasons and
112:43 - um
112:44 - so he he's able to have those videos be
112:47 - placed on nebula
112:49 - I'm not explaining that well but I'm
112:51 - very tired it's been a long live stream
112:55 - I'm scrolling through to see if there's
112:57 - anything else
112:58 - boy look at this
113:00 - this is processing from 12 1002.
113:06 - I was a young I was young then I was I
113:10 - started working with processing like
113:12 - right around
113:14 - I don't know somewhere in here
113:18 - okay more processing fellows
113:25 - my nebula class which I've talked about
113:29 - um came out
113:32 - um
113:33 - Lots about Apple II this this is I think
113:36 - my favorite thing that I made if you
113:38 - haven't seen it let's just watch this
113:42 - [Music]
113:46 - I'll be there
113:48 - [Music]
113:54 - [Music]
114:15 - oh baby we're going together
114:22 - [Music]
114:34 - okay
114:36 - [Music]
114:46 - okay that was my favorite thing
114:49 - foreign
114:51 - that I did I don't know what that refers
114:54 - to Leonardo oh it's okay
114:57 - um
114:58 - so
114:59 - more oh Sebastian lag that was a thrill
115:02 - seeing Sebastian lag make a snake game
115:04 - based on my video
115:08 - um
115:10 - John Mida tweeted a photo of maybe his
115:13 - Apple too that was really cool
115:17 - um
115:18 - Tetris look at this well other one made
115:22 - a Tetris clone for the Apple too
115:25 - uh okay keep going there's a lot of
115:27 - Apple II content here
115:29 - uh
115:31 - um
115:33 - I was featured in The Creator economy
115:35 - series on YouTube the new website
115:38 - launched
115:41 - um
115:42 - Andreas refgaard always makes really
115:44 - cool stuff
115:46 - uh um
115:48 - Runway did more amazing things we're
115:52 - getting there in September and I sort of
115:54 - stopped using Twitter a lot this fall so
115:56 - this should go pretty fast
116:00 - um
116:01 - ah yes this was also a huge thrill this
116:05 - is like by the way this was recorded I
116:07 - need to follow up I know people would
116:08 - actually want to watch the recording I
116:11 - might have to make this like a members
116:13 - only thing but I was able to participate
116:17 - at an evening of none it's their detail
116:19 - in New York City on Saturday the 8th of
116:21 - October three blue one brown Moira Dylan
116:25 - Jeremy Fielding Beck Hill if you're not
116:28 - a you know if you're not a Beck Hill fan
116:30 - I don't know that anyone could reach the
116:33 - Beck Hill fandom Heights that I have
116:35 - reached you should absolutely I mean you
116:38 - probably the reason why I'm you probably
116:40 - already know if you if you watch the
116:42 - coding drain you might be familiar with
116:44 - Matt Parker three blue one brown Jeremy
116:46 - Fielding bogra Dylan is a professor at
116:48 - NYU but you probably are not familiar
116:51 - with Beck Hill the comedian and
116:53 - television host and author and podcaster
116:56 - all of her stuff is just so so good so
117:00 - good ah I want to be back hill when I
117:02 - grow up
117:05 - um okay that was I I kind of was
117:07 - wondering so let me talk about that for
117:09 - a second
117:11 - so I don't know if any of you was
117:13 - anybody there anybody in the chat happen
117:16 - to be at an evening of unnecessary
117:18 - detail
117:19 - uh let's see if I can find I think there
117:20 - was a picture of it we'll get to it
117:22 - because I think there's a photo of me
117:25 - which will remind me more more Apple II
117:27 - stuff
117:29 - um I uh here we go
117:30 - so here is me thank you Mariko for
117:33 - tweeting this photo of me on stage uh
117:36 - Matt Parker typing into the Apple II
117:39 - so
117:40 - I feel like so I had 10 minutes
117:43 - and I had planned to Live code the
117:47 - bouncing ball in apple basic which I did
117:50 - but I wasted so much time that I only
117:53 - had about two minutes to do that and I
117:55 - think those two minutes
117:58 - were
118:01 - um those two minutes were the best part
118:04 - of my life my life I set so to speak you
118:08 - know we're talking about this as like a
118:10 - kind of comedy show or 10 minute sets
118:13 - and I think I did too much like trying
118:17 - to tell jokes to do explanatory
118:20 - introduction I feel like the first five
118:22 - to six minutes were not good I tried to
118:24 - also be in character like I just time
118:27 - traveled from you know I was like you
118:29 - know like a time capsule and I just
118:31 - exploded out of it onto the stage anyway
118:36 - um
118:36 - there was a recording of it
118:39 - um anyway I didn't feel I really would
118:41 - like to do more live stuff
118:43 - I did it I feel like I would give myself
118:44 - a B minus
118:46 - I uh everybody else I'd give it a plus
118:49 - with a phenomenal like seeing
118:52 - um Matt Parker perform live I mean this
118:55 - is really this is a skill it is a talent
118:59 - but it is also a rehearsed and practiced
119:03 - skill and I was thinking about doing
119:07 - like a live show if and when the nature
119:09 - of code book is done it's sort of like a
119:11 - book party
119:13 - but I don't know if I could pull off a
119:15 - full hour
119:16 - I could have guests I also just don't
119:18 - know like I think I need a like a
119:20 - director or a writer consultant to help
119:23 - me with this anyway that was a really
119:24 - that was a great thing I should put that
119:26 - under my accomplishments that was I
119:28 - don't like the expression like bucket
119:30 - list so much but that was like a bucket
119:31 - list experience for me uh
119:34 - so it it's going on the very bottom a e
119:39 - o u d
119:42 - so nature of code book
119:44 - live book party
119:48 - question mark I mean I could definitely
119:50 - do that venue caveat in New York was
119:53 - great do you want to invite me to like
119:55 - London I'll do one I don't know why I
119:58 - think one did because maybe maybe I
120:00 - could get you know some of the London oh
120:02 - Seb Seb who has uh was my inspiration
120:05 - for doing this because Seb Lee DeLisle
120:07 - if you're not familiar with Seb has done
120:09 - all these wonderful evening of an essay
120:10 - detail spots live coding
120:13 - um in London and Seb gave me some advice
120:15 - which I think I don't know if I took or
120:17 - not but what his advice was good and
120:19 - anything I did well was because of seb's
120:22 - excellent advice anything I did poorly
120:23 - was my own problem but um
120:27 - thinking about that for 2023 that would
120:29 - be fun to do just live coding for an
120:32 - hour or something a live coding train
120:35 - sort of thing
120:36 - uh creative coding comedy yeah I like
120:40 - your I like your
120:44 - ideas
120:47 - um Stig yes so I need to follow up and
120:49 - get the video of this because it was
120:51 - sent to me via a Dropbox link I clicked
120:53 - in the Dropbox link and it didn't work
120:54 - and I took that I was like a sign from
120:57 - God up above said nobody should ever
120:59 - watch this recording delete it from the
121:02 - world it happened it was there it was
121:04 - live
121:05 - I did it
121:07 - uh maths B was there oh and Max B is in
121:11 - the chat oh look hello to you uh that
121:14 - was I was so happy you were there it
121:16 - gave me a sort of a boost of energy uh
121:18 - to know that there was fans of the
121:20 - coding trade in the audience and thank
121:22 - you for saying that was great I really
121:24 - that's that's nice of you
121:26 - um okay moving along oh my God it's it's
121:30 - time it's two this is the end oh I got a
121:33 - dot matrix printer
121:36 - um
121:37 - uh what is this oh there's a new
121:40 - processing Library more Runway
121:44 - um
121:45 - uh Brian McManus also a nebula
121:49 - um
121:52 - et cetera et cetera et cetera blah blah
121:53 - blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
121:55 - blah
121:56 - uh uh more coding Train website
122:01 - um
122:04 - um
122:05 - some more other stuff some cool stuff
122:09 - uh Apple II uh set that I built
122:13 - erase and replace from Runway gave me
122:16 - that uh
122:18 - um
122:19 - uh Blair is an amazing artist some weird
122:22 - stuff about the Apple II Graphics we're
122:24 - so close we're in October
122:27 - uh this was my favorite Halloween
122:28 - costume that somebody dressed how fast I
122:31 - thought this is totally brilliant
122:33 - uh
122:34 - uh
122:35 - fun little uh trailer whoops this is the
122:39 - whoops for 2022.
122:44 - oops
122:47 - [Music]
122:52 - oh it's a little internet stutter there
122:55 - sorry it froze you can watch that on
122:57 - your own
122:58 - uh this was amazing hypercube running on
123:01 - the Arduino
123:02 - uh other people's great work on this I
123:05 - also used runways in painting so this is
123:08 - like just a still for my video that I
123:11 - used oh out painting I'm sorry to uh uh
123:17 - um to oh that's not what it looked I'm
123:19 - looking at it right over here not what
123:20 - the room looks like but Gotta Love what
123:23 - AI generated images can do these days
123:27 - we're almost done uh Mastodon I am on
123:30 - Mastodon I have not been using it
123:34 - um
123:35 - okay we've got my 3D video I'm gonna
123:38 - disappear from the internet soon because
123:40 - we're in November
123:43 - um more about nebula classes
123:47 - um
123:49 - uh uh and just some other stuff I think
123:52 - I've just started retweeting things uh
123:55 - talking about chat gbw this is the chat
123:58 - GPT uh
124:00 - um Starfield that I was referencing and
124:03 - uh
124:04 - the code from my challenge versus chat
124:06 - GPT
124:08 - that is such a cursed image
124:11 - I like these portraits from Runway
124:14 - uh I made a Survivor analogy bot
124:17 - uh
124:19 - uh uh whistle that's a cool project
124:24 - uh ITP show happened
124:27 - you can apply to ITP still
124:29 - and that's it we made it through 2022 we
124:33 - recapped
124:35 - whoops wow that camera went off wait was
124:39 - it not is it not plugged in
124:44 - oh no
124:47 - I moved the camera around and I didn't
124:49 - plug it back in well that's
124:52 - fortuitous
124:55 - here
124:56 - um
124:57 - we will take a picture of this
124:59 - whiteboard this is good I'm done anyway
125:03 - let me let me plug it back in
125:06 - where where did the plug go for that
125:08 - camera
125:09 - oh
125:11 - never ends I never never can get
125:14 - anything right here on the coding train
125:17 - it's so weird that's that one's plugged
125:19 - in
125:20 - it's funny I bought a second back of
125:21 - battery and everything oh here it is oh
125:24 - I forgot to plug it in I'm so silly
125:28 - it's on the floor
125:31 - all right we're we're gonna um this is
125:34 - I'm wrapping up folks but I'm gonna do
125:36 - some coding so don't go anywhere
125:39 - I'm gonna end by doing something for
125:40 - January
125:43 - and I'm gonna
125:45 - I'll come back to show the Whiteboard at
125:47 - the end let's go to the questions
125:49 - that should be charging up now
125:53 - uh
125:57 - um okay uh bias
125:59 - bias is in the chat
126:04 - um let's see uh
126:08 - um Okay so
126:10 - what's left for today buy us in the chat
126:13 - ah shorts why talk about the shorts
126:15 - coding guard and ask about the shorts
126:17 - perfect perfect timing because
126:20 - bias is in the bias is in the chat
126:23 - Bernie is in the chat let me go to let's
126:25 - talk about the shorts
126:28 - so
126:30 - I don't know about this shorts thing but
126:34 - I like to try all the ways of
126:38 - communicating with the audience that the
126:40 - internet has to offer I've been hearing
126:42 - about this
126:44 - social media platform that the youths
126:47 - have been using called tick tock
126:53 - that's right
126:55 - tick tock
126:57 - I have a tick tock
126:59 - so I'm experimenting with a variety of
127:02 - Joyful log sound effects a variety of
127:04 - YouTube has its Tick Tock like clone
127:09 - uh called shorts and thanks to the bias
127:13 - agency Bernie who I met in uh Copenhagen
127:17 - we've been exploring the idea of making
127:20 - coding trained shorts and the nice thing
127:22 - about this is they're actually really
127:24 - easy to make
127:26 - only one minute long
127:29 - if I record for like 15 minutes like
127:33 - you when I record like a coding
127:34 - challenge I I could be recording for
127:36 - eight or nine hours but like I can make
127:38 - a one minute short so we're I'm trying
127:40 - to figure out like what is a useful
127:43 - meaningful way
127:45 - to use this format to expand the
127:51 - audience of people watching the coding
127:53 - train that's not really the goal but
127:55 - what is the goal here why do I want to
127:57 - make shorts
127:58 - one is I'm just curious to try them
128:01 - because I like trying new stuff
128:03 - um I think
128:05 - the other goal would be to sort of build
128:08 - community and inspire people to code and
128:13 - try things out
128:15 - so there are a few different things
128:17 - um so one way of doing that is that we
128:20 - thought of is to answer your questions
128:22 - so so people we we sort of what we did
128:26 - is we went through and looked through
128:27 - YouTube comments and tweets picked out
128:29 - some questions did all this work with
128:32 - Bernie and um so you know I could play
128:34 - one of these I could answer questions so
128:36 - like
128:38 - um
128:39 - promise is a promise no coding train
128:41 - yeah so I uh yeah so this came from a
128:44 - question let's look at the Save gift one
128:45 - question from jewelry I want to include
128:48 - not a single PNG but a gift but I have
128:51 - problems with the correct implementation
128:52 - Julian your question couldn't have come
128:54 - at a better time and the newest release
128:56 - of P5 there is a save gift function
128:59 - arguments you need to add are file name
129:02 - for the gift you want to save and how
129:03 - long you want to record the candidates
129:05 - and then there's an additional trick
129:06 - that I'll show you in a minute whoa no
129:09 - idea what's gonna happen overlay now
129:11 - this is incredible oh look at that it
129:14 - worked it doesn't Loop perfectly that's
129:15 - because I just said do it for five
129:17 - seconds but what if I said do it for a
129:20 - specific number of frames a full loop is
129:23 - from zero to two Pi so the angle changes
129:26 - by two pi divided by the number of
129:28 - frames now I can replace the number five
129:30 - with the number of frames and then an
129:33 - options object to tell it the unit I
129:35 - wanted to consider is not seconds I
129:37 - think that's to perfectly looping GIF in
129:41 - P5 with one line of code
129:44 - question I want to include so I've seen
129:48 - the chat um people are are are
129:50 - rightfully critical of shorts I there's
129:52 - some shorts are click bait uh drown out
129:55 - the good videos uh shorts are a
129:58 - distraction I mean I have a problem like
130:01 - I
130:02 - when I first downloaded tick tock I kind
130:06 - of got like sucked in and I had deleted
130:08 - it off my phone like two days later then
130:10 - like a few weeks ago I downloaded again
130:12 - and now I set the thing where like if I
130:14 - look at Tick Tock for more than 10
130:16 - minutes it like beeps at me and says
130:18 - like hey you've been looking at this for
130:19 - 10 minutes maybe you want to take a
130:20 - break and I take a break so I do I do
130:23 - the shorts format I you know I enjoy
130:27 - watching them like there's like the
130:29 - talent of people like
130:31 - first of all the Tic Tac algorithm
130:32 - looked into my soul and found out who I
130:35 - am so after like watching i i before
130:38 - it's a little funny story here I I
130:41 - decided as an experiment brand new tick
130:43 - tock account let me just scroll and
130:45 - watch stuff I'm gonna give it one hour
130:48 - and I gave it one hour scroll past stuff
130:51 - watch stuff after an hour
130:53 - all the tick tock started showing me was
130:55 - a musical I was just in musical theater
130:57 - Tick Tock it was showing me behind the
130:59 - scenes music like people explaining uh
131:03 - there's this great I think the Mt was
131:05 - like all of the tic-tocker explains all
131:08 - sorts of stuff about
131:09 - um music theory about musicals and I was
131:12 - like seeing like you know just like
131:14 - tremendous talent to people like
131:16 - duetting stuff from musical theater like
131:18 - it was amazing so either was kind of
131:21 - like this is a little bit creepy but
131:22 - like you know I'm you'd think like I'd
131:24 - be into like Tech Tick Tock no I was
131:27 - just watching what I enjoyed skipping
131:29 - through things finding things all music
131:30 - computer content which totally said
131:32 - something about me
131:34 - um
131:35 - the audio plays twice when you're
131:37 - playing a video on the screen apologies
131:39 - it's because it's playing out of my
131:40 - speakers and in through my mic so
131:44 - I'm pressing the wrong buttons so anyway
131:47 - so these are the formats we're
131:48 - experimenting with
131:50 - um but let me just check my messages
131:52 - here
131:54 - um I can actually possibly Premiere a
131:58 - new short right here
132:01 - um which is that I think something that
132:03 - I'm excited about is can I
132:08 - also use shorts to give you like a
132:11 - really quick one minute overview of a
132:14 - coding challenge topic and then if
132:16 - you're interested in it you could
132:18 - obviously watch the longer one and so
132:20 - the very first one I'm going to go over
132:22 - here because I uh it's
132:25 - um I'm going to
132:27 - um
132:30 - I probably shouldn't do this because I
132:32 - should have you all
132:34 - make sure to watch this why am I in the
132:37 - processing Foundation YouTube account
132:40 - um
132:42 - I should uh have you all watch it
132:46 - okay this is the one
132:48 - you know what I'm gonna do let me show
132:50 - you I I some of you might have seen it
132:53 - because I briefly released it yesterday
132:55 - and then we found a mistake in it so
132:58 - here's what I'm gonna do
133:01 - uh coding coding guarding we're writing
133:04 - a really interesting comment here which
133:05 - is a new generation people that consume
133:07 - all their media through shorts Tick Tock
133:09 - reels you kind of have to publish there
133:11 - to get in them interested in the long
133:12 - form content
133:14 - yeah and it's not click bait if it
133:16 - introduces new users to other valuable
133:18 - coding trained content
133:20 - um yeah this is kind of like my thinking
133:23 - I mean I'm you know I'm going in with
133:26 - some caution I want to be careful I want
133:29 - to bring positive
133:31 - meaningful
133:33 - communication to the internet not uh
133:37 - which which can just be people doing
133:39 - silly dances like again this is not a
133:41 - good like I enjoy watching people doing
133:43 - silly dances it brings me like lights up
133:47 - certain things in my brain makes me feel
133:48 - a little bit of happiness go on video I
133:50 - do think there is a danger to the sort
133:53 - of addictive quality of the rabbit holes
133:55 - that we can get sucked into but you know
133:59 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
134:01 - show you
134:02 - the
134:04 - version
134:06 - that is currently understanding
134:07 - experience
134:10 - stop stop stop pause okay
134:13 - I am going to uh play
134:16 - right Z Dax it makes a good point you
134:19 - can't learn coding by shorts so I
134:21 - wouldn't expect to be making shorts that
134:24 - are really like long form tutorials but
134:27 - they might have a little bit of an idea
134:29 - that gets you thinking to try something
134:31 - or that might get you excited about
134:34 - something to go and learn coding
134:36 - um
134:37 - so
134:39 - um
134:40 - yeah yeah
134:41 - um okay so here is
134:44 - this is so this is what I'm going to ask
134:46 - of you
134:48 - the short that I'm going to play for you
134:50 - I've spent longer explaining this short
134:52 - than sure is one minute long there's a
134:55 - mistake in it in the end so this is the
134:58 - unlisted it won't matter for your
134:59 - experience of it right now at all
135:00 - because the mistake is like you'd have
135:02 - to like pause zoom in to find the
135:04 - mistake but I still wouldn't like it to
135:06 - be there
135:07 - so I would like to play this for you get
135:10 - get your thoughts on it Bernie is in the
135:11 - chat
135:13 - um later today uh I'm going to release
135:17 - the fixed version of it it would be
135:20 - wonderful if you would watch it it only
135:22 - takes one minute I would also love to
135:25 - hear from you if it pops up in your
135:27 - short speed randomly
135:30 - um anyway so this one actually already
135:32 - has like a few hundred views 40 likes on
135:34 - it I don't know I'm a little worried
135:36 - that releasing it and then taking it off
135:38 - and then uploading a new one is going to
135:40 - mess this one up but
135:42 - um
135:45 - um I I want to read maths these are
135:47 - there's a really great discussion going
135:48 - on in the chat right now about the
135:51 - shorts I know I lost the Discord chat
135:53 - because I went to my direct messages
135:56 - so apologies to coding trained members
135:59 - if you're uh okay yeah
136:02 - um
136:02 - okay great so so a math here it's the
136:05 - gift one encapsulates the idea of
136:06 - inspiration really well getting excited
136:08 - to figure out how to create the same
136:09 - thing yeah that's the idea
136:11 - um okay so let's without further Ado uh
136:15 - let's Premiere this short and it's
136:18 - unfortunately going to start in the
136:19 - middle two to one minute I'm gonna take
136:21 - it easy on myself start with the
136:23 - recursive tree which was only about a 15
136:25 - minute video in the first place I'll
136:27 - play it through twice start with a blank
136:28 - canvas set a line color and a stroke
136:30 - weight translate to the bottom middle of
136:32 - the canvas which is where the tree will
136:34 - grow from then write a function draw a
136:36 - branch which is just a single vertical
136:38 - line with the magic of recursion the
136:40 - branch function can call itself
136:42 - shrinking the length of the next time
136:44 - but this would end up in an infinite
136:45 - Loop so we better have an exit condition
136:47 - to stop drawing when the branch gets too
136:49 - short then we can add an angle translate
136:51 - to the end of the branch to draw the
136:53 - next one then we can rotate off to the
136:55 - right by some angle we can also
136:57 - recursively rotate off to the left throw
136:59 - a little push and pop in there so that
137:00 - each time we draw a branch we're
137:02 - starting from the right position there
137:03 - we go a fractal Tree in p5.js you can
137:05 - watch the full video for a much longer
137:07 - explanation the coded train passenger
137:09 - showcase is full of your beautiful
137:11 - recursive trees you're watching this
137:13 - right now at your own
137:14 - I want to try and experiment can I boil
137:16 - down one of my full coating Challenge
137:18 - videos into one minute I'm gonna take it
137:20 - easy on myself and start with the
137:22 - recursive tree which was only about a 15
137:24 - minute video in the first place step
137:25 - number one start with a blank canvas set
137:27 - a line color and a stroke weight
137:29 - translate to the bottom middle of the
137:31 - canvas which is where the tree will grow
137:32 - from then write a function draw a branch
137:35 - which is just a single vertical line
137:36 - with the magic of recursion the branch
137:39 - function can call itself shrinking the
137:41 - length of the next time but this would
137:43 - end up in an infinite Loop so we better
137:44 - have an exit condition to stop drawing
137:46 - when the branch gets too short then we
137:48 - can add an angle translate to the end of
137:51 - the branch to draw the next one then we
137:52 - can rotate off to the right by some
137:54 - angle we can also recursively rotate off
137:56 - to the left throw a little push and pop
137:58 - in there so that each time we draw a
138:00 - branch we're starting from the right
138:01 - position there we go a fractal Tree in
138:03 - p5.js you can watch the full video for a
138:05 - much longer explanation the coded train
138:07 - passenger showcase is full of your
138:09 - beautiful recursive trees you're
138:11 - watching this right now at your that
138:16 - all right so uh so so that's the new
138:19 - short I'm pretty excited about this one
138:21 - I also recorded one where I try to make
138:25 - the recursive tree with chat GPT that
138:27 - hasn't been uh finished yet but that
138:29 - will come out at some point too
138:31 - um
138:33 - so
138:34 - um
138:35 - so I'm sorry I'm reading the chat so a
138:38 - if you have any thoughts I mean I don't
138:41 - think realistically we're not going to
138:42 - like redo this whole short right now in
138:45 - the next but because Bernie fixed the
138:47 - error
138:48 - um
138:51 - um but thank you Cody garden and me I am
138:53 - so B for your positive feedback
138:55 - um but I um so this short actually I
138:57 - just got a message from Bernie I see
138:59 - that the new version is uploaded Bernie
139:01 - if you're listening if you're watching
139:03 - you can actually go ahead and uh if you
139:06 - want to like upload this into the
139:08 - channel and duplicate all the metadata
139:11 - um then I could potentially release it
139:13 - at the very end of this live stream but
139:17 - um
139:19 - uh
139:20 - Adam Savage has the slogan about his
139:22 - videos that they are not how-to videos
139:24 - as much as they are what happened videos
139:26 - interesting interesting that's
139:28 - interesting to think about it because I
139:30 - really do think about a lot of my videos
139:32 - as how-to videos the coding Challenge
139:34 - videos are kind of what happened but
139:37 - they are sort of like watch it while
139:40 - it's happening you know because I don't
139:43 - that's what I'm I'm thinking about if I
139:45 - if I I don't know if the the Whiteboard
139:47 - camera came back on but I'm thinking
139:49 - about doing some like let me go back and
139:51 - write a script to explain the process of
139:54 - building something
139:56 - um that that could that's something that
139:58 - I'm interested in doing anyway ah
140:01 - I am
140:04 - I am
140:06 - um
140:07 - really really tired it's been two hours
140:11 - and 20 minutes I didn't take a break I
140:14 - think I need to wrap things up
140:17 - um I want us to continue this
140:19 - conversation about what's going to
140:21 - happen with the coding train in 2023 I
140:24 - want to see if this camera comes back on
140:27 - uh which it did it is not in Focus
140:30 - anymore so let me focus it
140:33 - so excuse me my whiteboard is back
140:38 - uh
140:42 - and uh all right so let's take a look
140:46 - let's let's take a look at the
140:50 - Whiteboard here this is the map
140:54 - I'm sure I missed things
140:55 - I didn't touch on anything I don't have
140:57 - every new possible idea written here but
141:00 - this is everything that I accomplished
141:02 - for the coding train in 2022
141:05 - yay me did this get really dark again
141:08 - yeah I think it didn't save whatever
141:11 - camera settings
141:14 - so strange I don't understand this this
141:17 - camera
141:18 - but um
141:21 - I should get maybe I should get new
141:22 - cameras for 2023 cameras are very
141:24 - expensive but I that's something that uh
141:28 - did I say that this uh sponsored by
141:32 - curiosity stream bundle I'll put the
141:33 - link on screen in a second it's in the
141:35 - description
141:36 - um
141:37 - this is uh sorry yay to celebrate 2022.
141:41 - here's
141:42 - a hope for 2023 of many things I would
141:45 - like to work on
141:47 - um I don't know how to prioritize this
141:49 - somebody wants to I I maybe I should
141:52 - like reformat this into some kind of
141:54 - document or GitHub markdown or something
141:59 - um but I'm excited about if if I do
142:02 - if I get a quarter of what's on this
142:05 - list done in 2023 I will be happy uh I
142:09 - think priorities are I've got to get the
142:10 - nature of code book done I've got to
142:12 - send out these whistles
142:14 - to people who have supported the coding
142:16 - train for a long time I really should
142:17 - make a video to announce the coding
142:19 - Train website and I hope to work on this
142:21 - Oregon Trail project
142:23 - uh and I would love to get 10 coding
142:27 - Challenge videos done
142:30 - I kind of want to put a red star there
142:34 - 10 coding challenge videos
142:37 - topics whatever
142:39 - and then I'm not sure about under here
142:42 - like what
142:43 - if I had to pick one tutorial series to
142:46 - absolutely do
142:48 - honestly I think it might be the
142:50 - processing for intro series
142:52 - which is my oldest set of tutorials to
142:55 - redo those and I think that's the thing
142:57 - I could just like sit down for a day and
143:00 - do it'll obviously take more time to
143:02 - edit and put it all together but in
143:03 - terms of recording
143:05 - um that's might be the easiest
143:08 - um
143:09 - okay I also really want to do this
143:10 - Severance working titles thing but I
143:12 - don't know if that gets a red star okay
143:15 - before I go
143:18 - thank you wolf Rose
143:21 - um
143:22 - before I go
143:26 - I'm already 25 minutes over what I want
143:29 - it to be
143:30 - but let's look at January
143:35 - and let's go to
143:39 - um the prompts oh I am tired
143:43 - I need coding Garden you have this I
143:45 - don't know if Cody Gardner is still
143:46 - watching you have this thing that like
143:47 - pops up to remind you to take a break or
143:49 - stretch good thing about me and my
143:51 - situation is I always stream standing
143:54 - whoa
143:56 - sorry the green screen curtain is like a
144:00 - skew and I just slipped on it because I
144:02 - was gonna feel like I'm always moving
144:04 - around but I really should take uh
144:07 - breaks
144:09 - um okay I my nose is running I hope I'm
144:11 - not getting sick I don't think I am
144:13 - um Okay so
144:16 - perfect Loop infinite Loop endless gifts
144:20 - well that's funny that's the prompt for
144:22 - today
144:23 - huh
144:27 - so let's use Save GIF in P5
144:30 - time out for Mac
144:32 - I should get that uh
144:35 - David Curry hello there I hope I get to
144:37 - see you uh this spring when I'm back
144:43 - lovely to see names that I recognize in
144:45 - the chat and new names I almost meant to
144:47 - oh let's fix it all right so
144:50 - what is your in the chat everybody let
144:53 - me know
144:54 - what is something you did in 2012 all
144:59 - right I'm so tired I was like I like to
145:02 - hear from people in the chat
145:04 - what is something you coded in 2022 that
145:08 - you're proud of
145:11 - put that into the chat
145:13 - all right let's go to
145:16 - look at
145:19 - let's log in here
145:21 - oh I forgot about the online questions I
145:23 - will come back to those
145:34 - um
145:40 - okay open
145:43 - all right
145:48 - so
145:51 - I'm gonna come back this this is still
145:54 - here pinned comment
145:57 - but let's make a perfect looping gif
146:01 - for the new year let's make a happy New
146:04 - Year looping gif
146:07 - Tomer Schwartz says I coded a complete
146:09 - neural network from scratch Martin
146:11 - bellanger a simple inventory system for
146:14 - work in Python Melissa Rodriguez a
146:16 - squiggly line algorithm I feel like I
146:18 - remember seeing you post about this
146:21 - ah your live coding language runs on a
146:23 - Nintendo DS David Curry wow uh Game of
146:28 - Life and flocking simulation senior
146:30 - thesis oh hey Maverick did a PID control
146:33 - system well all this stuff you guys are
146:35 - coding is amazing
146:37 - did anybody learn to code say hi in the
146:40 - chat if you learned to code in 2022 like
146:42 - you had never coded before Kathy says
146:45 - the mandelbulb thank you Kathy uh ASCII
146:49 - art from DJ Mangus all this is great
146:52 - great I love hearing these I love
146:54 - hearing all these from you all okay so
146:57 - what should my
147:00 - can we make a perfect looping firework
147:03 - gif
147:05 - let's try this I don't I don't have a
147:07 - lot of energy right now to code
147:08 - something new
147:09 - so I'm pretty sure I have
147:13 - let's go to codingtrain.com
147:17 - challenges
147:19 - filter by topic let's look up fireworks
147:26 - let's go to
147:29 - 2D fireworks
147:31 - here's the example
147:35 - okay so how could I turn this into
147:41 - a um Joe says I learned P5 just from you
147:46 - in 2022 no exposure before
147:50 - it gets the train whistle all right so
147:53 - here is let me just also make sure my
147:55 - family isn't like texting me like where
147:57 - where where are you
147:59 - uh okay
148:01 - um
148:03 - uh okay uh
148:05 - okay okay okay
148:07 - uh we're gonna release okay see we got
148:09 - we got a bunch of things going here got
148:10 - a like a lot of things okay impossible
148:13 - okay uh
148:15 - hi from Brazil I know there's a lot of
148:18 - folks who watch in Brazil this is
148:20 - another question by the way I'm sorry
148:23 - that I cannot keep a thought going here
148:26 - but I'm reminded by how International
148:28 - the audience is
148:30 - um
148:31 - I have the opportunity to dub a lot of
148:34 - my videos using AI technology
148:38 - and it's quite good
148:40 - I would say it's not the same but I'm
148:43 - hesitant to do that part of me feels
148:46 - like
148:48 - I shouldn't be take I shouldn't okay so
148:51 - I would love to make the videos more
148:53 - accessible and have them be in more
148:55 - languages
148:56 - but I would rather somebody watch a
148:59 - native speaker of their own language
149:01 - teach them the concepts then my voice
149:05 - somehow AI dubbed into that other
149:07 - language I definitely will experiment
149:10 - with it but I'm I'm confused about that
149:12 - and thank you
149:14 - um
149:15 - yes and congratulations to you Brazil on
149:18 - your new president and happy 2023. okay
149:22 - let me move let's we got to make this
149:24 - happen so I'm going to make this first
149:26 - thing I got to do here is first
149:27 - duplicate it
149:30 - then
149:32 - I need to let's make it uh 640 by 360.
149:40 - so how could this be a perfect Loop well
149:43 - I guess it could be a perfect Loop
149:45 - if
149:47 - I let this window clear
149:58 - could it
149:59 - huh
150:01 - I'm trying to think I mean I certainly
150:04 - could use random seed right
150:06 - so that it runs there's no purling noise
150:09 - or anything here
150:12 - um
150:15 - I'm struggling
150:19 - um
150:27 - people are talking about in the chat
150:29 - about the language translation switch
150:32 - between two ran make five or six
150:34 - spawners that only create a new
150:36 - fireworks once each
150:39 - Ken Haley says
150:41 - reseeding
150:43 - so say more Ken Haley
150:50 - this
150:53 - right like it should be able to oh what
150:56 - if I reseed it in the middle right
151:00 - uh
151:05 - I don't know I know why I'm not able to
151:07 - Think Through how I think it's because
151:09 - I've been live streaming for two and a
151:10 - half hours without a break I'm not able
151:12 - to Think Through effectively how to do
151:14 - this as a loop
151:18 - I see what if I okay let me let's think
151:21 - about it this way
151:24 - what if
151:28 - I need a cycle right
151:33 - right every n frames reset the random
151:35 - seed after the first n frames the loop
151:38 - should be perfect
151:41 - right so what if okay so I I get I got
151:44 - the I I understand now I think which is
151:46 - that if
151:49 - but there's a lot of how much Randomness
151:52 - I guess there's not a lot of Randomness
151:53 - once they burst
151:56 - so okay
151:57 - so let me do it this way for a second
152:04 - um like what if I do this okay
152:07 - random seed 99.
152:11 - and then I'm gonna have a counter
152:16 - so every time there's a new firework
152:21 - counter plus plus
152:23 - if counter
152:26 - I need this to happen after everything
152:29 - else
152:31 - actually it shouldn't really matter but
152:36 - yeah and then
152:39 - if counter
152:41 - is greater than or equal to 5.
152:46 - random seed 99.
152:50 - so let's do three
152:55 - this is what I'm trying to do basically
152:57 - I start with a random seed which will
153:01 - push in
153:02 - three zero one two
153:08 - once we get four
153:10 - zero one two three once we get
153:13 - zero goes to one one goes to two two
153:15 - goes through now once we get three
153:21 - one two three random seed should start
153:24 - over
153:28 - oh and the counter has to go back to
153:30 - zero
153:34 - okay
153:35 - one two three
153:38 - one two three
153:40 - uh
153:42 - what did I miss here
153:45 - uh
153:50 - so I got close
153:53 - but the third one doesn't match up
153:57 - third one is always different
154:00 - because
154:06 - the third one
154:08 - do I need okay hold on
154:12 - let me do it with just one
154:17 - yeah okay so this is working why do I
154:20 - suddenly get another one
154:22 - over there
154:26 - like I'm getting the same one over and
154:27 - over again
154:31 - because
154:35 - yeah this is a really
154:44 - tricky coding problem that I have
154:47 - created for myself
154:50 - but I would kind of like to be able to
154:52 - solve it now
154:57 - just curiosity
155:03 - just try
155:15 - yeah what
155:17 - what causes the slightly different one
155:20 - to happen
155:28 - there's a lot of random stuff going on
155:33 - what if
155:41 - what if I didn't use random at all
155:53 - what if I didn't use random at all here
155:55 - just out of curiosity
156:09 - just taking out all the randomness from
156:15 - yeah okay so now this works
156:22 - so I think the issue was
156:24 - I wonder if using
156:28 - P5 Vector random 2D is messing up the
156:32 - random seed because okay okay hold on
156:34 - hold on I got an idea
156:40 - okay
156:42 - okay so now let me get rid of this
156:46 - okay hold on hold on oh let me get rid
156:48 - of the auto refresh for a second
156:51 - um
157:03 - hold on let me do it this way
157:07 - I'm sorry my um so what if I use
157:13 - I'm so tired and I haven't had any lunge
157:18 - this is like the worst time for me to be
157:21 - doing this
157:22 - but I'm determined
157:24 - with stubborn
157:28 - from angle so what I'm doing is
157:31 - my suspicion is that what if
157:36 - uh
157:41 - what did I mess up now okay
157:46 - no okay so no
157:52 - so okay
157:54 - so let's just
158:02 - oh yeah so that yeah so no
158:18 - oh this doesn't matter because that's
158:19 - just the firework the the original
158:22 - particle I see
158:23 - so it's here
158:25 - so what if I have an idea
158:34 - just bear with me for a second here I'm
158:37 - gonna do something weird
158:54 - interesting
158:57 - I I could make an array
159:02 - random 2D uses that's why I thought
159:05 - that's why I thought me I am so me
159:07 - might be the problem
159:17 - oh
159:18 - how if you have more fireworks in the
159:20 - air than the number of calls you're all
159:22 - like telling me really good things in
159:24 - the chat
159:29 - so I think what I need to do
159:32 - I have a very weird idea
159:36 - which is
159:39 - I mean what I need is multiple
159:43 - I need a different idea
159:47 - making a perfectly looping
159:50 - firework system I think maybe I should
159:52 - go for a different a different idea is
159:56 - this is this am I going down a path that
159:58 - I I just want to be done
160:01 - so let's do a different Happy New Year
160:04 - let's use the text 2023 I have an idea I
160:07 - have an idea I have a better idea okay I
160:11 - have a better idea
160:16 - here here
160:18 - I think you need to pre-compute the
160:19 - exploded particles random data from when
160:21 - the firework is launched that's what I
160:23 - was thinking but I'm gonna I'm pivoting
160:26 - I'm pivoting
160:30 - um okay
160:32 - uh we're gonna do uh steering
160:41 - uh
160:44 - okay we're going to do this
160:47 - okay
160:51 - oops
160:55 - well not new oh my God I I duplicate
160:58 - duplicate
161:09 - okay
161:10 - this is what I'm going to do
161:13 - um
161:14 - so let's first
161:16 - boy this is old code
161:20 - um
161:23 - font text to points
161:26 - why is it not Center that's going to
161:28 - bother me and let's forget about the
161:31 - mouse
161:33 - okay
161:34 - I need to get rid of the mouse
161:46 - whoops
161:53 - okay
161:54 - so I can make this you just run it
161:58 - backwards
161:59 - like every okay
162:01 - okay make every particle a random color
162:04 - I like that so I'm just going to do a
162:07 - very basic version of this High roadock
162:09 - by the way thanks for all your help with
162:11 - the various repos you've been
162:12 - contributing to
162:14 - um so this obviously I could I
162:18 - I could run it backwards but I want uh
162:23 - let's actually code running it backwards
162:25 - I'm sure there's a very creative clever
162:27 - thing that I could do with this
162:29 - but right now
162:33 - I'm going to say this dot home I'm going
162:36 - to give it a new variable called home
162:39 - and then its actual position is
162:42 - this.home dot copy
162:47 - and then
162:50 - um when
162:52 - um
162:54 - so I just out of curiosity let's just
162:56 - say in behaviors let's calculate the
162:59 - distance
163:01 - okay I got to turn off auto refresh
163:04 - um one thing that drives me crazy about
163:06 - the web editor I don't know if this is a
163:08 - known bug that's been uh posted is if
163:10 - you have Auto Refresh on and an error
163:13 - happens it like takes you out of the tab
163:15 - you're typing in which kind of makes
163:16 - sense but I don't know if there's a way
163:18 - around that okay distance is
163:21 - um uh P5 vector
163:24 - distance
163:27 - between this dot position and this dot
163:29 - Target
163:32 - if this if distance is less than one
163:42 - then
163:43 - um
163:44 - this dot Target
163:47 - equals this dot home so let me just try
163:50 - this for a second
163:58 - so this is them all going back
164:02 - I kind of want to add separation in
164:05 - yeah so the problem here also is I need
164:10 - to wait until they're all done
164:16 - add
164:21 - let's do this
164:25 - so this is a little bit silly but
164:27 - um
164:34 - let's assume
164:36 - let's assume that they all are done
164:44 - and if
164:47 - its position
164:52 - is
164:54 - greater than one pixel
164:57 - than all done is not is not true
165:04 - so basically I'm going to look at every
165:06 - single vehicle and compare its position
165:08 - to its Target and if any single one of
165:11 - them
165:12 - is further than one pixel they're not
165:15 - all done then
165:18 - if all done
165:22 - four let V of vehicles
165:26 - V Dot Target equals V Dot home
165:29 - then I'm going to set all of our targets
165:32 - back to the home
165:40 - what what is this extra Square there did
165:43 - I type something in by accident oh
165:46 - whoops that's weird
165:54 - oh this is
165:57 - and this is okay look I gotta put Auto
166:00 - refresh back on
166:05 - what did I miss
166:13 - I feel like
166:16 - uh oh
166:19 - that shouldn't matter right
166:27 - oh oh my goodness
166:38 - so this is
166:40 - not the greatest
166:43 - clever this thing I've ever done but
166:47 - hold on let's I can also I think this
166:49 - must be what's centering it yeah
166:51 - I see so I guess I'm just gonna eyeball
166:54 - centering it
166:55 - I'm so tired I have to finish this live
166:57 - stream
167:09 - okay excellent
167:12 - so I would like to add separation into
167:15 - it although that's not really going to
167:17 - work because they can't be separated as
167:19 - they all right so
167:22 - so this works the question is now
167:27 - how do I Define like if I use Save gif
167:31 - let's go back to P5
167:35 - the save GIF function
167:41 - what I want to do
167:45 - is call
167:48 - save gif
167:50 - certain number of seconds
167:52 - and we could try just with seconds
167:54 - because it's going to end back where it
167:55 - started
168:00 - let's just try
168:02 - oh you know what
168:05 - we are not using a recent version of P5
168:21 - I don't know what's going on
168:28 - let me I definitely need to take off
168:29 - auto refresh now because that's going to
168:31 - mess things up
168:34 - okay nothing's in there
168:45 - let's see why does it do it twice when
168:47 - you put it in setup
168:49 - so weird
168:51 - there's some bug
168:55 - I had this issue before
168:58 - so this makes no sense to me but I'm
169:01 - gonna try something
169:03 - so I'm going to take
169:05 - save gif
169:19 - by the way it's also uh I haven't been
169:22 - running the heat for noise in here now
169:23 - it's getting very cold so my fingers
169:25 - can't type
169:26 - uh
169:28 - and I'm going to say
169:34 - I'm going to create a Boolean called
169:35 - Ready Set it to false
169:39 - and then
169:42 - set ready equal to true
169:46 - and then only if ready
169:50 - do all this stuff
169:53 - all right ready let's see how this does
169:56 - so now
169:58 - as soon as I hit the space bar
170:03 - why is it doing it twice
170:06 - do you notice that am I losing my mind
170:08 - here
170:13 - thank you
170:22 - watch this
170:27 - watch this
170:32 - we're gonna hit the space bar
170:36 - it acts like it's doing it and then it
170:37 - like stops and does it again
170:40 - and then it downloads the GIF and it's
170:42 - empty now I had this issue before
170:47 - I don't remember why
170:52 - I'm very sad
170:55 - this is welcome to the 2023 on the
170:59 - coding train where nothing I do works
171:02 - and I don't understand why and I'm very
171:04 - tired and I need to eat lunch
171:09 - what
171:11 - like what am I missing here
171:13 - I mean I think it's just a bug in save
171:15 - gif
171:18 - because it should start doing it at that
171:21 - time I had this issue before when I was
171:23 - recording that short
171:25 - save gift first saves each frame then
171:28 - renders them
171:30 - I don't
171:31 - it says saved then rendered
171:35 - save then renders
171:38 - okay wait wait wait I'm not
171:40 - understanding this
171:41 - saves each frame then renders them what
171:46 - does that mean
171:47 - I'm looking at the chat I don't
171:49 - understand what that means
172:05 - okay
172:08 - oh how much time we should wait before
172:10 - recording
172:15 - it is not recommended to write this
172:16 - function inside setup since it won't
172:18 - work properly okay
172:29 - the first time it says save the second
172:32 - it says rendered
172:41 - okay so I does specifically say don't
172:44 - put it in setup which makes sense
172:52 - let me run this again and see if I can
172:54 - catch what you guys are all saying
173:00 - saved frame rendered frame
173:06 - oh oh that makes sense so it's actually
173:09 - not doing it twice
173:13 - but why is my so now the question
173:16 - becomes why is my GIF empty
173:18 - or is it not empty
173:23 - why is it empty
173:29 - so now something else is going on so
173:31 - okay it is doing it
173:34 - let's just give it 10 seconds
173:43 - right saving all these frames so that
173:45 - makes sense
173:47 - and now it's rent it's just telling me
173:48 - what's going on I got it's not doing it
173:50 - twice it's saving then it's rendering it
173:53 - saving it into memory and then rendering
173:55 - it the question I have
173:57 - is why is it empty
174:10 - I totally understand now
174:21 - um what is the most
174:40 - key pressed save gif 10.
174:45 - what if I were to say let's try this
174:49 - this should be the same thing oh no
174:53 - what if I put in draw and setup
174:56 - no Loop
174:59 - and then say Loop
175:01 - here
175:13 - oh I shouldn't make it that long
175:22 - well this is weird oh red I forgot about
175:25 - the oh it's because of this
175:29 - ah
175:43 - try this oh let's not okay yeah
175:48 - there we go this should work now
175:53 - let's see if this works
175:57 - could it be a quick look thing it could
175:59 - be do you think it's like actually
176:01 - working but I'm just there we go
176:04 - I don't know what I did
176:10 - but now it works
176:17 - this is like the least interesting thing
176:20 - I could have done but let's um I think I
176:23 - only need about three seconds
176:35 - foreign
176:37 - let's see
176:42 - there we go
176:49 - wait I actually what I want
176:53 - is for it to be a hold on the 2023
176:56 - longer
176:58 - but it's fine
177:00 - you get the idea
177:07 - oh yeah yeah happy 2023 everybody all
177:11 - right let me save this code
177:15 - uh let me put it in the chat
177:18 - is anybody even still watching this
177:20 - stream some people are
177:25 - uh
177:27 - okay
177:28 - there you go you can I'm sure you can
177:31 - improve this in 700 million different
177:34 - ways
177:36 - I'm going to call this a win
177:40 - uh that I have now made
177:45 - a happy New Year looping 2023. happy
177:48 - 2023 everybody
177:50 - yes happy 2023.
177:54 - oh my God it's so loud
177:59 - thank you thank you uh this is my oh
178:03 - that camera went off but I don't care
178:04 - all right let's do something exciting so
178:08 - here are my calls to action
178:10 - one is thank you uh to curiosity stream
178:15 - for offering this highly discounted
178:17 - bundle if you go to curiositystream.com
178:20 - choo choo you can get curiositystream
178:23 - thousands of documentaries and nebula
178:26 - um but really
178:28 - um for free so thank you to curiosity
178:30 - stream for sponsoring
178:32 - um this coding train uh live stream and
178:35 - for sponsoring coding train really for
178:37 - all of 2022 and
178:39 - you know for the foreseeable future so
178:41 - go check out that link
178:43 - um if you're interested in my uh in the
178:47 - nebulous streaming service or in
178:49 - particular
178:51 - um
178:52 - I'm just going to bring up this um
178:55 - you know if you have a friend uh uh who
178:58 - wants to learn to code maybe this uh you
179:01 - know hello there's the Cody drain
179:02 - YouTube channel but I also made this uh
179:04 - class on the nebula streaming service
179:06 - that I hope you would enjoy that you
179:08 - could get uh you could get directly
179:10 - through this link uh right uh
179:13 - go.nebula.tv Slash what is code but the
179:16 - curiosk stream bundle will give it to
179:18 - you for about two dollars per month
179:20 - whereas if you go through this link uh
179:23 - it's about four dollars per month so
179:25 - both support the coding train so you
179:27 - just want to put that out there Link in
179:29 - the description
179:30 - uh
179:32 - uh oh right uh whiteboard is there you
179:35 - can just go back and that's the plan now
179:38 - let's do something exciting here
179:41 - we are going to go
179:45 - and launch a new short on the coding
179:48 - trade
179:50 - so uh I am going to go to the studio
179:54 - YouTube Studio
179:57 - um
179:58 - and I'm going to go look at
180:02 - uh
180:04 - uh
180:06 - coating a fractal Tree in 60 seconds
180:09 - zero views I'm going to change this one
180:12 - to private
180:15 - you know I can I can I can give you a
180:17 - little peek into YouTube Studio here
180:19 - so I'm going to go here and I'm going to
180:21 - change this one to private
180:26 - save
180:27 - and this one I feel like I should check
180:30 - it all right I'm going to check it on
180:32 - this laptop
180:34 - I want to try and experiment can I boil
180:36 - down one of my full coding Challenge
180:38 - videos into one minute take it easy on
180:40 - myself and start with the recursive tree
180:42 - which was only about a 15 minute video
180:44 - in the first place sorry that you're not
180:46 - able to see this is that a line color
180:48 - and a stroke translate to the bottom
180:50 - middle of the canvas which is where the
180:52 - tree will grow from then write a
180:53 - function draw a branch don't worry I'm
180:56 - still here I'm paying attention to you
180:57 - just hold on a second
180:59 - call itself shrinking shrinking the
181:02 - length I think
181:05 - it's only a minute it's only a minute I
181:07 - just double checking it
181:09 - translate to the end of the branch
181:11 - rotate
181:21 - there we go a fractal tree and p5gs you
181:23 - can watch the full video for a month
181:25 - we're starting from the right position
181:26 - there we go a fractal tree and p5gs
181:29 - that looks like the right code line
181:31 - translate Push rotate Branch push rotate
181:34 - area all right I think we're good
181:36 - all right so we're going to do something
181:38 - really exciting here
181:42 - uh this has been a three-hour stream how
181:45 - did that happen
181:46 - okay I'm definitely gonna I guess I'm
181:50 - eating dinner at this point by the time
181:51 - the stream's over okay thank you all for
181:54 - being here
181:55 - um what I'm going to do is I am going to
181:59 - set this video to public
182:02 - I'm not going to set it as an instant
182:04 - Premiere because that's silly and then
182:07 - uh I'm gonna say goodbye uh which is
182:11 - this is me saying goodbye I'm gonna set
182:13 - this to public I am asking all
182:16 - uh 200-ish of you to go and watch this
182:21 - short and maybe you could like leave a
182:24 - like and a comment you know just if you
182:28 - want just for engagement just to see
182:31 - like I think this is this short it's
182:33 - gonna be it's gonna launch the coding
182:36 - chain into 2023 in a way you could never
182:39 - possibly imagine thank you for being
182:42 - here during this stream
182:44 - um I'm setting it to public there we go
182:46 - publish it uh it's there you could go to
182:50 - the coding train watch it uh thanks
182:52 - coding Garden for answering the question
182:54 - about the arraylist thank you all I I
182:56 - have to say I've been kind of feeling a
182:58 - little bit like I just have like
183:00 - what like it's really struggling with
183:03 - this stuff that I've been doing

186:24 - importance
186:27 - [Music]
186:29 - my mic is still on let's forget that my
186:31 - mic's on okay one more song Everybody uh
