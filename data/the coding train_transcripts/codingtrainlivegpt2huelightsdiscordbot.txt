03:49 - hello I am live good evening good night
03:53 - good spooky night time it's Thursday
03:56 - it's a lovely clock at night and my name
03:59 - is Dan shippin and you're watching the
04:00 - coding trade late-night oh I have to
04:04 - tell you something I did not get to have
04:07 - a nap today you might be saying what's
04:11 - wrong with you what are you taking naps
04:13 - well I wake up very early in the morning
04:15 - and I stream very late at night and
04:17 - sometimes around 3:00 or 4:00 in the
04:19 - afternoon
04:19 - I let myself doze off for about 20 or 25
04:21 - minutes but it was an especially busy
04:23 - day and there was no nap so here I am
04:26 - I'm very excited this is the last
04:28 - late-night livestream of the week I have
04:30 - a lot of things planned for tonight I
04:32 - will be here for you know an hour and
04:35 - when I say an hour you know what I mean
04:38 - by that but next week if all goes well I
04:42 - will be premiering the coding train
04:44 - morning show so this is my new plan at
04:47 - least probably for the month of June
04:49 - it's not June yet but I'm gonna try to
04:51 - get this going for a month too
04:52 - a week of late night 11 p.m. shows and a
04:55 - week of early morning 70 shows because
04:58 - those are the times of day when my
05:00 - children are not awake and I'm not sped
05:04 - I'm not with them we're here doing quite
05:09 - well in Brooklyn New York but my family
05:12 - we spend every waking living moment with
05:16 - each other
05:17 - it's a lovely wonderful gift to be okay
05:21 - so so we'll see how that goes so I want
05:24 - to get going pretty quickly our our in
05:30 - quotes says William Hillary thank you
05:32 - for that yes quotes hmm I have a
05:37 - delicious cup of ginger tea keeps me in
05:43 - check because without that ginger tea I
05:47 - don't know what I would be doing or
05:48 - saying at this time well we have to
05:52 - begin as I always do with every coating
05:54 - tape I think that I typically just mess
05:59 - up the words that come out of my mouth
06:01 - and they generally don't form correctly
06:05 - in regular time I think I have a new
06:08 - member but especially late at night when
06:11 - I haven't had my nap no nap today I
06:13 - remember when my children were young and
06:15 - they actually had to take a nap that was
06:17 - a glorious time when they when they
06:19 - actually did take their now so I want to
06:21 - thank our new member unknown admin
06:24 - unknown admin
06:28 - I appreciate the fact that you've just
06:30 - joined the coding train as a member for
06:33 - your membership you don't really get
06:36 - anything I mean eventually someday I
06:40 - will mail you some stickers and as the
06:42 - message I got from a member today said
06:45 - are you planning to smell those stickers
06:47 - soon it's been about six months it was a
06:49 - very kind and nice message and if you're
06:52 - that person or have that thought in your
06:54 - mind please join the discord I will post
06:58 - a link to it and send me a note there
07:04 - because just just in case you don't
07:08 - believe that I am going to get around it
07:10 - hold on pause pause pause and eat
07:15 - another sound effect hold on a second
07:17 - this is a terrible idea what I'm doing
07:20 - coming over here and I am attempting to
07:25 - move can you see me you can't see me you
07:27 - can hear me I'm over in the side mmmm
07:29 - over here I got there's some plates and
07:31 - bowls anybody want some soup nope okay
07:35 - by the way I have this really expensive
07:37 - microphone that I can't figure out how
07:39 - to get to work maybe somebody wants to
07:40 - help me with that okay here is my box I
07:47 - am going to open this and inside of it
07:53 - is this stack of envelopes with decoding
07:57 - train return address on them which is
07:59 - just a UPS store that I use that I have
08:04 - not been to in two months I hope you can
08:06 - send me an email there and even each
08:09 - envelope is a sheet of stickers and I
08:12 - have made new stickers which are on
08:14 - their way and I will mail these to you
08:19 - who who in the chat somebody in the chat
08:21 - has gotten the stickers from me right
08:22 - because I see CJ's they're pretty sure I
08:24 - sent the stickers to CJ say forgotten
08:27 - secrets I got to get those out I got to
08:30 - get those got to get those mailed this
08:31 - shirt Yas curved kurta is a thing they
08:35 - like over they I should read what
08:37 - they've actually said in the chat the
08:38 - pineapples are cool thank you
08:40 - I picked this shirt up in keyway
08:42 - I had a lovely vacation in Key West
08:44 - sometime last year I think I don't know
08:47 - time has no meaning anymore
08:49 - hmm hmm where were we right
08:53 - unknown admin the new member and so one
09:05 - thing that I can promise you one thing
09:07 - that I can provide for you
09:09 - a small solace in this unprecedented and
09:13 - challenging times is your very own
09:16 - random number and here it is for you I
09:19 - hope I haven't read it to somebody else
09:20 - because I promised that their unique I
09:22 - do not have 1 million members so yours
09:27 - on page 331 is one of my favorite random
09:31 - numbers it begins with a 7 it's followed
09:35 - by a 1 and then another one
09:38 - and six and into 370 1163
09:45 - thank you
09:47 - [Music]
09:50 - and now I am not able to hire a writing
09:55 - staff to help me with my opening
09:57 - monologue that would be a wonderful
10:01 - thing but I was lucky enough to discover
10:04 - that I could create my own opening
10:07 - monologue with some artificial
10:09 - intelligence so I'm going to go to my
10:11 - web browser that you can't see right now
10:14 - and I have closed all of my tabs no I
10:17 - haven't I still have this one and I am
10:20 - going to open up my robot I need so I
10:25 - need a good I need some like robot music
10:27 - a robot theme for when the robot is
10:29 - going to speak to us maybe I can use
10:32 - something I have right now that would
10:34 - work robot robot robot this one okay the
10:45 - robot is here the robot joke writer what
10:50 - did the for-loop say to the while loop
10:54 - oh wait
10:58 - the robot is broken come on robot run
11:04 - run run
11:05 - [Music]
11:08 - let's see
11:13 - we're waiting for the robot ah okay it's
11:17 - running okay the robot is running and I
11:21 - will now hmm hello and welcome to the
11:26 - coding train everybody do boy are my
11:30 - arms tired
11:32 - oh wait I'm so late I just flew it no I
11:33 - didn't fly and what did the for-loop say
11:38 - to the while nothing it just said stop
11:41 - working
11:43 - [Applause]
11:51 - why is my code not working
11:54 - it just keeps changing what does a sync
12:07 - do it reads its lines and prints all the
12:11 - time I guess I should probably this
12:16 - might be more effective if I showed you
12:18 - what's actually on my screen why why is
12:28 - Java the best programming language of
12:32 - all time it has the capability to
12:38 - program in a number of working s eyes
12:48 - so what's the good this is really good
12:54 - what's wrong with me
13:00 - tell me oh great
13:03 - joke bot generator dad blocks out my
13:09 - sleep okay I've wasted your time for
13:16 - about ten minutes I'm going to continue
13:19 - to waste your time if you keep watching
13:21 - this it's too bad that CJ's in the chat
13:23 - and not actually live streaming so I
13:25 - can't tell people to just leave and go
13:26 - watch
13:27 - CJ's Channel I did make some notes to
13:30 - myself here of a couple things that I
13:33 - wanted to share with you so one thing I
13:35 - should mention is at the moment
13:37 - everything that has to do with this new
13:40 - series which might it's probably gonna
13:43 - be canceled as of tomorrow if we're
13:45 - being totally honest here is in this
13:47 - particular github repo coding train
13:51 - slash late night on github and so I've
13:55 - been filing some issues of things that I
13:57 - want to get to I'm this is one thing I
13:59 - have to do there's a major audio glitch
14:01 - how many where's my so my lav mic has
14:09 - two bars I'm using the same battery I've
14:13 - rechargeable batteries from last night I
14:15 - figured I should let it like drain out
14:16 - the problem is when it drains out it
14:19 - causes an enormous amount of horrifying
14:21 - horrible static that's very loud in your
14:23 - ears maybe keep your volume a little
14:25 - down so that's one thing I want to fix
14:30 - something that I really want to do that
14:32 - I would gladly take help on is I want to
14:35 - create a readme file for each for each
14:38 - episode because I'm doing a lot of stuff
14:40 - in them
14:41 - YouTube apparently has this new feature
14:43 - that if you put time codes in the
14:45 - video's description it'll create
14:47 - chapters so people coming back later
14:48 - could actually find specific moments I
14:51 - haven't done any of them and thank you
14:53 - so much to Tiki head on github who
14:55 - started creating one for me
14:59 - and let me just move over here so you
15:00 - can see it so here it is and one thing
15:03 - that I would say these are super useful
15:05 - and actually that's probably that's what
15:07 - it should be in the time code but what
15:09 - it really should be if it's okay with
15:12 - you is if I go to edit the time codes
15:16 - need to work like free to be YouTube
15:18 - compatible like this start you know like
15:22 - animation you know start like you know
15:27 - start of stream so something like that
15:31 - this is the for you can't see cuz I'm
15:33 - really not I need an AI to like put me
15:35 - in the right location and now I go back
15:39 - over here so this is what YouTube wants
15:41 - for the formatting although actually
15:42 - what I think would probably work best is
15:45 - to do something like this because then
15:49 - it'll work in markdown
15:51 - but then when I cop when I go it started
15:53 - than when I go in copy paste so I don't
15:54 - want to belabor this that's misspelled
15:57 - I'm gonna do actually just cancel this
15:58 - thank you so much
16:00 - Tiki head I would encourage you to to
16:04 - learn to make your first pull request if
16:06 - you want to try that it would be an
16:08 - exciting thing to try you could create a
16:10 - new file in the repo put this stuff in
16:12 - it and add as a pull request and I do
16:15 - have a video series about doing your
16:18 - first pull requests on github alright so
16:21 - that's one thing that I wanted to
16:23 - mention so you can you can start to look
16:25 - in these issues for things that you can
16:27 - help with I also want to take a look at
16:31 - a couple links that I wanted to share
16:37 - number one
16:38 - I'm planning to do a collaboration video
16:39 - with an old friend Seb Lee de Lisle who
16:45 - just created this video has our YouTube
16:47 - channel just created this video about
16:49 - making this interesting hardware project
16:54 - that is a DEFCON indicator and if you
16:59 - watch all the way till the end you can
17:01 - answer a question to get it as a
17:03 - giveaway but apparently it's not gonna
17:05 - give it away
17:05 - unless there are two thousand I mean I
17:08 - he might give it away anyway I don't
17:10 - know what he's planning to do but
17:12 - two thousand likes so let's see if we
17:14 - can get the coding train energy over two
17:16 - subs channel and see if we can get that
17:18 - I know and there's you know at the
17:20 - moment just 270 of you watching and
17:22 - probably 267 of you are bear but you
17:28 - know go over and check that out I also
17:31 - wanted to mention I work with the
17:34 - processing Foundation which is a
17:36 - nonprofit organization a lot of
17:37 - community and open source initiatives
17:40 - that we do one of one of the things we
17:43 - do is run a fellowship program and I am
17:45 - the mentor for the fellowship program
17:46 - and this this season fellowship season
17:50 - I'm mentoring Erin Devi who started a
17:52 - new twitch channel called cozy coding so
17:55 - I mentioned a lot of switch channels i I
17:57 - have like lots of twitch fomo I feel
18:01 - like it should be on Twitch but I just
18:03 - get you know maybe I'm too old for
18:05 - twitch which is obviously not the case
18:06 - but that's my like pretend excuse and I
18:11 - just wanted to mention Erin's new
18:13 - channel cozy coding I've been watching
18:16 - the streams trying to participate really
18:18 - wonderful beautiful cool like
18:21 - visualizations that she is making this
18:24 - was in the most recent stream I mean
18:25 - that you'd all the way on this very low
18:27 - resolution image but I really encourage
18:30 - you to check out I don't know when she's
18:32 - streaming next but check out cozy coding
18:35 - alright it is late at night and we have
18:39 - got to get
18:41 - some of our work
18:55 - all right so one of the reasons why I
18:57 - haven't green-screen myself yet because
19:00 - I do have a green screen I could pull up
19:01 - here is because I really want to work
19:03 - with these hue lights and I want to
19:05 - allow you the audience to control and
19:08 - set the color of my you light so that's
19:12 - something I am working on if you want to
19:13 - know what I'm this music is very
19:15 - distracting to me right now I'm gonna go
19:17 - back to the readme here and these are
19:22 - various things that I am working on so
19:25 - the midnight pump guy should uncheck
19:27 - this is the midnight pumpkin alarm it
19:31 - needs what it needs actually let's let's
19:33 - fix this let's edit this it now in
19:38 - progress but it needs style Gann
19:42 - pumpkins so that's something I need to
19:44 - work on but the thing that I started
19:51 - last night that I used which clearly I
19:54 - need to work on some more because it's
19:56 - the greatest thing ever is my random doc
20:00 - death I should get like a jar and every
20:05 - time I misspeak and say a word
20:07 - incorrectly I have to I don't know put a
20:09 - coin in the jar and I could donate the
20:11 - money to charity I want to work on my
20:15 - dad joke generator so this is really
20:19 - actually practice because ultimately one
20:22 - of the projects that I want to do is
20:23 - train a GPT to model on all of my
20:27 - YouTube transcripts so I'm gonna have to
20:29 - do some scraping or use the probably
20:31 - just actually the YouTube dia the
20:32 - YouTube DL which is a command line not a
20:37 - scripting module thingy that I can
20:39 - download videos and audio and subtitles
20:41 - from YouTube videos so that actually
20:43 - probably pretty easy for me to get those
20:45 - transcripts but so what is GPT - that's
20:54 - a great question and maybe somebody out
20:57 - there in the universe could be a guest
20:58 - on this channel to try to explain it let
21:00 - me actually give you a nice resource
21:02 - that I did I recently see GPT - Runway
21:05 - ml
21:07 - YouTube pretty sure the runway actually
21:09 - has a video called generative text
21:13 - training with GPT - so I'm gene Cogan I
21:16 - believe appears in this video and
21:17 - explains a bit about how it works in
21:19 - Runway and what the gp2 t22 model is I
21:22 - might refer you to just briefly
21:24 - something on my channel that I have
21:27 - discussed called
21:28 - Markov chains a Markov chain is a
21:33 - probabilistic well I said I think I said
21:36 - probabilistic correctly a Markov chain
21:42 - is a way of looking at a sequence of
21:47 - information for example what's the
21:50 - weather like today and then tomorrow and
21:51 - the next day and the next day after that
21:52 - or how do you spell the word hello or
21:55 - what are the notes of this melody all of
21:57 - those are sequential pieces of data and
21:59 - looking at how elements of the sequence
22:03 - appear next to other elements the free
22:07 - that in the frequency of how they may
22:09 - bring elements appear in that sequence
22:11 - so you could look at text as saying like
22:13 - well every time I write a T in in all of
22:17 - the text that I've ever written there's
22:19 - a 50% chance the next letters an H a 20%
22:22 - chance the next letter is an A and we
22:24 - could do a statistical analysis of a
22:25 - large body of text and then generate
22:27 - text based on those probabilities that's
22:29 - what a Markov chain is my program but
22:31 - from A to Z or it's actually called
22:32 - programming with text on YouTube course
22:36 - goes over that in quite a bit of detail
22:38 - and follow-up to that is something
22:41 - called a car RNN so car RNN is probably
22:45 - was made famous from by Andrey Carpathia
22:49 - I mean I might be incorrect about this I
22:50 - don't know where the original paper was
22:52 - but a recurrent neural network is a
22:54 - neural network that deals with
22:55 - sequential data so it uses the
22:58 - mechanisms of a neural network to look
23:01 - at to predict what element should appear
23:04 - in sequence after another element and so
23:07 - ml 5 which is a JavaScript library that
23:09 - I've been working on and I've done a
23:11 - videos about and the channel has a car
23:13 - RNN module and you can train your own
23:15 - model and you can do examples and I've
23:17 - done stuff with that and Nabeel Husein
23:19 - who is
23:22 - car RNN I think we'll came on as a guest
23:25 - on and by the way L STM stands for a
23:29 - long short-term memory it's a variation
23:31 - of a of an RNN that does some additional
23:39 - stuff inside the little neural network
23:40 - modules little brain pieces little
23:42 - neurons they have some little extra good
23:44 - degrees deliciousness in them do keep I
23:49 - don't go into it right now
23:50 - also cuz I don't really understand it
23:52 - I'm in the wrong place I really like to
23:54 - point at exactly what I'm looking at so
23:56 - up there above me is a preview of Nabil
23:59 - going over lsdm so jeep GPT to the t is
24:05 - for transformer I forget what the G and
24:07 - the P is Oh Bert FB projection the chat
24:11 - is also talking about Bert which is a
24:14 - Google's natural language problem of
24:17 - this stuff there's a I'm actually one of
24:20 - the things I'm going to be working on
24:21 - eventually on this channel as with
24:23 - everything is looking at magenta models
24:25 - a melody RNN for generating a melody
24:27 - anyway all this it says GP t2 is the
24:30 - latest all the rage sequential data
24:33 - generator machine learning model and I
24:36 - kind of done a cursory glance over the
24:39 - GPT two papers I've watched some videos
24:41 - on them by no means I'm an expert in how
24:44 - it works but the thing that I think is
24:47 - most important to emphasize is unlike
24:50 - with the Markov chain and unlike I'm
24:54 - just going to move to this this view
24:56 - unlike with the Markov chain example and
24:58 - the actual car RNN example or LCM
25:02 - example those models or text generators
25:07 - were trained on data of my own only and
25:11 - that was the only thing they knew about
25:13 - to generate the new text GPT 2 is an art
25:19 - is a neural network architecture but
25:21 - it's it's most famous because I mean I'm
25:24 - sure there's a variety of companies and
25:26 - entities and organizations that have
25:28 - done this training but I think open a I
25:30 - might have been one of the first or if
25:31 - not the first trained
25:34 - own GPT too model off of a massive
25:38 - amount of text you know essentially like
25:40 - for all intents and purposes like the
25:41 - entire Internet and so it's a text
25:44 - generator that just knows what's you
25:47 - know has learned from a tremendous
25:48 - amount of text now all of that text is
25:50 - sort of just filled with all sorts of
25:53 - like biases and particular style that
25:56 - you know has to do with how people write
25:58 - in English in certain parts of the world
26:00 - from certain cultures so I think there's
26:02 - a lot to be sort of questioned about
26:03 - that but what I'm doing with this dad
26:06 - joke generator what I want to do is my
26:08 - scripts is not training a new GPT to
26:11 - model I'm taking the existing GPT to
26:13 - model trained off of the entire internet
26:15 - I'm not actually taking that one I'm
26:17 - taking a much much much much much
26:18 - smaller one it's so quite a large model
26:20 - but is much much much much smaller and
26:22 - fine-tuning it so what does that mean
26:25 - I'm giving it some extra text and saying
26:28 - hey just keep yourself going and like
26:29 - look at this is kind of like sort of
26:31 - some primary important information and
26:33 - so it's able to kind of learn from your
26:36 - text but keep but keep its understanding
26:40 - of how language works how the sequence
26:43 - of characters flow in the English
26:45 - language okay there was a lot of
26:46 - explanation but what's kind of amazing
26:49 - is this software that you can get from a
26:54 - company called runway runway ml I assume
26:57 - that's the URL runway ml machine
26:59 - learning for creators this was actually
27:02 - featured on I think the quarter cruise
27:04 - YouTube channel they did something with
27:06 - runway which is just like kind of blew
27:07 - my mind this is not a free thing this is
27:11 - downloading the software and tinkering
27:13 - with it is a fairly free ish and I keep
27:19 - meaning to I had a coupon code for
27:22 - awhile and I have to like ping a runway
27:25 - and get that coupon code again I might
27:27 - have some breaking news in the middle of
27:29 - this stream if I get I did ask but I'm
27:33 - so the founders of runway were graduates
27:36 - from ITP at NYU where I teach that's my
27:38 - day job and
27:41 - I worked with some of them closely and
27:44 - I've stayed in touch and helped advise
27:46 - the company kind of informally so I'm a
27:49 - little bit involved with runway but
27:50 - mostly it's just something that I love
27:52 - because what it's allowed me to do I
27:54 - actually before a runway had built into
27:58 - it let me go to just browse models and
27:59 - go to GPT
28:00 - - so these are oh look at this oh no
28:06 - this is me I'm like wait somebody
28:09 - already made one and then I rose it's me
28:11 - I was just wanted to look for the I
28:15 - don't know who's this film script
28:17 - generator I was looking for hosted
28:23 - models no that's this other thing I want
28:25 - to look at I'm lost anyway Oh remove
28:29 - backgrounds from people new we should
28:31 - try this let's try this choose input no
28:35 - I want choose input no I want video how
28:38 - do I get an input oh do I have to give
28:39 - it an image video mmm all right I'll
28:44 - look at this later it's just too much
28:46 - exciting stuff to play with that's to
28:47 - make depth from images remove background
28:49 - - oh man it's so much stuff to do this
28:51 - one is actually quite a cool model
28:54 - anyway so it's really just this
28:57 - wonderful library of all of these models
29:02 - that you could explore and most of these
29:04 - before runway came along if you wanted
29:07 - to run then you had to engage in a very
29:09 - long process of trying to clone a github
29:12 - repo and get all your settings correctly
29:14 - and maybe push it to the cloud because
29:16 - your GPU on your computer didn't work so
29:18 - this is a allows you to just run these
29:21 - models most some of them vary some with
29:23 - some exceptions you can run them locally
29:25 - on your computer run way is running on
29:27 - the computer but in most of them like I
29:30 - go here to this model that I trained
29:33 - most of them you have to run them on a
29:36 - cloud server and that's what you're
29:38 - paying for so you're paying for the time
29:39 - the cloud server runs okay now what did
29:47 - I want to say I was a long explanation
29:49 - that's 11:26 I better get to sleep at
29:52 - some point tonight
29:54 - this joke generator didn't work so well
30:00 - why because I trained it off a very very
30:03 - small data set so even though I'm just
30:05 - doing the fine-tuning I don't need to
30:07 - have a massive data set of the entire
30:10 - internet that I've done it and I'm you
30:13 - think that's somewhat facetiously just
30:14 - as a kind of just generic like big text
30:18 - data set uh you know be I think it's
30:21 - worthwhile to do the research of your
30:22 - religion stuff is what actually was used
30:25 - in the training process for these models
30:26 - but I want to get some more jokes all
30:30 - that is to say is that I filed an issue
30:32 - last night that was called knee more
30:35 - jokes and I'm gonna go over to that
30:38 - issue right now and people uh people
30:40 - gave me some jokes which is nice like I
30:43 - just paste those in manually which I
30:45 - think I will do but this is another
30:48 - official joke API but this is a so you
30:52 - know unfortunately I didn't actually
30:54 - look at any of this in advance so let me
30:58 - just before I click on anything let me
31:02 - just click over and see this looks very
31:04 - reasonable so I'm gonna come back to it
31:07 - so look at this this is reddit jokes
31:10 - that does not sound like something I
31:12 - want I mean yeah I mean stupid stuff
31:19 - sounds like something I want no I don't
31:21 - want blonde jokes that doesn't seem good
31:23 - Waka scrape from Wacha calm no come on I
31:30 - want dad jokes a little bit afraid to
31:32 - use these but I do like the fact that
31:36 - this is a hundred and ninety five
31:40 - thousand jokes that's definitely what we
31:44 - need where where where where if there's
31:53 - like is that waka sounds see available
31:55 - categories here let's look at this daily
31:59 - joke animal artwork blonde grows knock
32:03 - knock knock knock I could do not
32:05 - one-liners puns
32:07 - all right I'm good with puns children I
32:11 - could do is get hope that's not jokes
32:13 - about children comedy rating Gio can I
32:20 - just only get the g-rated ones that
32:23 - could be good and misunderstood music
32:25 - student we played the beatles last night
32:27 - jim student who won so could i possibly
32:34 - download okay I like this waka waka so I
32:38 - think this is good this is promising
32:39 - let's look at the waka JSON this is a
32:45 - seven megabyte file that's very
32:47 - promising let's download this file let's
32:54 - see doesn't have the rating in it that's
32:56 - sad
32:58 - I want the rating let's see what if I do
33:04 - how many jokes was in there what if I
33:06 - just pick kaggle short jokes I've got a
33:11 - new one from CJ let's take a look at
33:13 - that short jokes collection of 200,000
33:19 - short jokes for humor research all right
33:21 - let's throw caution to the wind these
33:25 - look like they might be long and it's a
33:26 - CSV which is very promising I don't know
33:33 - what should you do before criticizing
33:34 - pac-man
33:36 - Wacka Wacka Wacka Milan
33:40 - No so this there I see the thing about
33:43 - this is I I really really really really
33:46 - I you know jokes can be a wonderful
33:48 - things and it's a really really fine
33:51 - line between a joke that is funny and a
33:53 - joke that hurt somebody's feelings but I
33:55 - absolutely very strictly do not want a
34:00 - joke that the AI generates and is gonna
34:03 - be very hard to do this just bull
34:04 - blanketly without any issues so I could
34:07 - I could I should have spent the time
34:09 - cleaning out a set of jokes and I could
34:11 - have just deleted ones I didn't want but
34:13 - I'm not happy with these okay we might
34:16 - get that much farther with this let's
34:18 - look at this rapid API Dada Dada
34:20 - jokes is usually pretty good okay
34:23 - unlimited supply of dad jokes for our
34:25 - dad jokes application alright so let's
34:31 - see version random jokes removed is this
34:35 - this is like a different API how do you
34:39 - make holy what see this is good
34:41 - how do you check if a web page
34:47 - try it out on Internet Explorer I'm
34:53 - being told oh for a couple things I've
34:58 - got some breaking news
35:01 - no not that one
35:04 - breaking news from the coding train
35:07 - member check
35:09 - violet tells me that computer file has a
35:12 - good series on GPT - I did not know that
35:14 - I'm going to have to watch that because
35:15 - maybe I can understand how GPT you two
35:17 - works a little more and so are you
35:22 - hearing the weird mic interference music
35:28 - is a little loud okay hold on this is
35:30 - all stuff I can fix sorry I didn't look
35:31 - at the chat I don't know what that
35:34 - interference is so my phone is sort of
35:38 - here but we'll just hope it doesn't
35:40 - become too distracting okay thank you
35:45 - I've now lost the YouTube chat let me
35:47 - try to get that back alright let's try
35:49 - to get a better so I'm I'm enjoying this
35:52 - random one this I'm sorry rapid API one
35:58 - so could I possibly get all these I can
36:01 - I just like download all the jokes
36:02 - unlimited supply like the idea of
36:04 - unlimited supply of jokes that's very
36:06 - good
36:08 - API calls getting started Joe random
36:16 - jokes count so jokes ID if they're
36:20 - actually numbered jokes create remove
36:24 - knock-knock type count alright so how do
36:27 - i how to test end points
36:31 - oh I have to sign up for a key okay that
36:35 - I can do subscribe to test
36:38 - oh there's some stuff I'm gonna have to
36:39 - do all right everybody let's make this
36:42 - happen I am going to sign up for this
36:49 - website I'm gonna get myself an API key
36:51 - and I'm gonna download all the jokes if
36:54 - somebody in the disc Court can do this
36:58 - faster than me and like pull request a
37:00 - file to my github repo that would be
37:03 - awesome
37:03 - alright internet watch Jake who's going
37:06 - to be faster at this you most definitely
37:10 - subscribe login sign up I'm gonna sign
37:15 - up with github that's probably a bad
37:16 - idea
37:17 - I'm gonna do it anyway I don't got a lot
37:19 - of time here yes definitely take my
37:21 - personal data yeah personal data it's
37:24 - good you can have it
37:26 - alright my full name is Daniel Shipman
37:29 - and my organization is the coding tree
37:33 - okay I'm in uh oh here's my API key
37:38 - everybody you can't see it I covered
37:41 - some of it up there's gotta be a way for
37:43 - me to regenerate that how do i
37:47 - regenerate it come on I didn't know we
37:54 - just show up so quickly database oh no
38:01 - that's its category I was hoping I'd
38:02 - just download it how do i regenerate my
38:06 - API key I guess I could just I guess I
38:13 - could just use it right now how do I
38:16 - copy it
38:19 - no to copy code oh this is like node
38:25 - code that's weird
38:27 - require uni rest I'm gonna use uni rest
38:38 - it's waiting for the Internet to do
38:41 - better than me I don't you can't see
38:42 - what I'm doing because I'm like I'm like
38:44 - panic by like not showing you my API key
38:47 - copy code don't worry I'm gonna show you
38:58 - some actual code in a moment so at the
39:03 - right now this is the code that I wrote
39:07 - yesterday that got all the dad jokes
39:10 - from I Can Has dad joke
39:14 - so that wrote all the jokes out to a txt
39:18 - file and I want to do the same exact
39:21 - thing right now so I'm gonna just
39:23 - comment all that code out I know you
39:25 - can't see it because I've got a obstacle
39:29 - you in a second what's the thing I
39:33 - should use just the thing I should use
39:39 - right the node module is called dot env
39:43 - it's not what it's called so now that I
39:46 - have dot E and V I'm pretty sure this is
39:49 - a thing that there's my API key again I
39:55 - guess I'm not on the screen here now you
39:57 - can see me let me go to we're gonna need
40:00 - to look up at the discord bot that I
40:03 - made with code and garden eventually
40:07 - once I turn this all into a discord bot
40:09 - so and I'm pretty sure this uses I'm
40:16 - pretty sure that this uses dot E and V
40:18 - excellent so I use dot E and source
40:24 - index require dot E and V config okay
40:29 - awesome awesome up there's my API key
40:31 - again don't worry I'm gonna get it
40:34 - private soon enough you don't have the
40:35 - end characters doesn't fit all f4 to
40:39 - generate read is that really true alt f4
40:42 - I hope people aren't trolling me here in
40:44 - the chat let's try to regenerate it oh I
40:51 - was ok where is that ok alt f4 I don't
40:54 - even have an alt I'm on a Mac keyboard
40:56 - is that option f4 I got a touch bar you
41:00 - think there's an f4 on this touch bar
41:02 - are you insane do you understand what
41:05 - Apple has done
41:05 - there's nothing but USB see can i
41:08 - regenerate my API key by plugging
41:10 - something into the USBC port do you know
41:13 - how many dongles I have around here the
41:15 - cables it's insane what have you done to
41:18 - me was not alt f4 definitely not there's
41:28 - gotta be a way to command for no whew
41:30 - that just changed me to a new tab
41:32 - alright let me go back to my code it has
41:34 - the API key in it you know if I get
41:36 - banned
41:37 - alt f4 it's like it does something else
41:39 - probably closes the window of current
41:41 - application okay that was so sad how I
41:44 - fell for that
41:45 - I'm a very gullible friendly human okay
41:48 - I like to believe in people because you
41:50 - the viewers of the coding train are
41:52 - actually some of the nicest most
41:54 - thoughtful genuine heart inducing people
41:57 - of the world so try to stay that way
42:03 - all right now
42:06 - yeah what am I doing here dotty Envy
42:16 - where's my so now if I go back to the
42:24 - music still too loud by the way turn it
42:26 - down a little bit let me go to env
42:33 - sample okay so basically I just need to
42:39 - make a dot env file put something like
42:44 - this in it then I put my API key oh you
42:49 - don't see it so I made a dot env file
42:53 - this is my not real API key then I can
42:58 - go over to the code where I have my
43:01 - actual API key that you can't see you
43:05 - can't see it no just okay I think let's
43:10 - use the honor system everybody'd when I
43:12 - just say close your eyes close your eyes
43:14 - yeah that'll work
43:15 - I'll be fine so now I am going to paste
43:21 - well my lights are blinking ooh Jake has
43:25 - an excellent idea Jake Jake suggests can
43:30 - you do a tutorial on simulating magnetic
43:32 - field lines that interact with other
43:34 - magnet field lines north/south
43:35 - relationship huh the bread button at the
43:38 - top top left regenerates it okay okay
43:41 - this is a great idea right now I don't
43:44 - have a great system for suggesting
43:45 - topics the rainbow topics github repo
43:48 - maybe somebody can post a link to it
43:50 - there's a red button
43:51 - people are still oh so I'm being told
43:58 - this API has only has a get random joke
44:00 - endpoint and there's a 50 call limit on
44:03 - the free account plan all right
44:14 - timeout we're gonna have to start over
44:21 - and find our own dad jokes on the
44:24 - internet I mean getting 50 more would be
44:31 - good actually
44:31 - I had 650 so 50 more is 50 more I mean I
44:37 - should still get it but maybe somebody
44:41 - could just grab it's for me maybe I
44:46 - should go to the hue lights the troops
44:50 - were actually pretty good with my crappy
44:51 - dataset I just sort of thought you know
44:54 - while it's you know the first ten
44:56 - minutes of the livestream no problem
44:59 - I'll just download one of these
45:00 - suggestions and I'll have a new dataset
45:01 - no problem no it's just not how it works
45:06 - this kind of stuff takes hours it takes
45:08 - all day it takes weeks why would you
45:10 - ever think you could just like do it
45:12 - like I'm gonna do a one-hour coding show
45:15 - nightly and I'm gonna train a new
45:18 - machine learning model I'd scrape a
45:19 - dataset and clean the dataset in just
45:21 - like the first ten minutes let alone the
45:24 - first hour it's just not possible why
45:29 - does everybody say I look like this
45:31 - money heist professor because I have not
45:34 - watched that show is it good should I
45:36 - watch it I get that all the time all
45:40 - right
45:40 - I made a pull request for episode 1
45:43 - thank you me jail run done thank you
45:45 - well that is wonderful I really
45:47 - appreciate that let's see if there's any
45:49 - activity happening here data set we
45:56 - looked at this one I mean I I think I'm
46:00 - gonna I think I'm gonna have to offline
46:03 - or in the morning show or like dedicate
46:05 - or do some research and get some more
46:10 - dad jokes and I think maybe what I
46:14 - should do is go back to what I was
46:16 - trying to do last night which is turn
46:20 - the debt the joke generator into a
46:22 - discord bot but even before that
46:25 - make it a glitch app so that I could
46:29 - create it as an overlay on my street all
46:36 - right anybody who wants to help and try
46:40 - to just collect a few more jokes let's
46:44 - go back let's go back to my code here
46:49 - where I'm gonna comment out this rapid
46:52 - AI which by the way have at it with my
46:54 - API key which will only let you do 50
46:56 - requests oh I really should I think I
47:03 - have to just say oh I Jake that's so
47:05 - kind of you to do the super chance to
47:08 - highlight your question so I would I
47:14 - would actually do and I I really I think
47:16 - maybe that super chats as a way of
47:19 - answering coding questions during a live
47:22 - stream isn't perhaps the best way to
47:25 - sort of organize what it is that I'm
47:26 - doing but for a lack of a of a policy
47:31 - about that let me actually answer your
47:33 - questions and see you since you did do
47:36 - the super chat thing so I just posted a
47:39 - link to the discord and if you join the
47:41 - discord you can ask that question there
47:44 - and it's a wonderful community of people
47:46 - and I try to engage and answer questions
47:47 - there as well but the nature of code
47:49 - series especially the gravitational
47:52 - attraction one would probably be that
47:53 - can be modified to work with a magnetic
47:55 - attraction okay now let me get back to
48:00 - my laptop here we're gonna do some
48:04 - manual curation of jokes I hated
48:08 - absolutely hated that I all I did was
48:12 - just take the jokes and duplicate them a
48:15 - hundred times so I'm going to try to
48:18 - create a dataset that just has the jokes
48:20 - in there once let's run this one more
48:26 - time I kind of like just shutting my
48:30 - camera off by the way I find it like
48:32 - totally freeing but I guess suppose I
48:35 - should add myself back in here so let's
48:37 - take a look
48:38 - at this it's already open and we're
48:42 - going to go to jokes txt okay so here we
48:45 - got 693 jokes guess what let's add some
48:52 - jokes here's a way to create a dataset
48:55 - oh so everybody's saying that if you can
49:02 - only get 50 random jokes but there's
49:04 - more than 50 random jokes in the
49:06 - database a bunch of you could do this so
49:08 - any of you who can't maybe somebody can
49:10 - spin up a really quick script or just
49:14 - like and so a bunch of you could so if
49:17 - you can submit jokes now I'll take them
49:18 - so let's do that we're gonna we're gonna
49:20 - Crouch this is it I've got it I've got
49:22 - it I've got it we you and me right here
49:28 - right now we are going to crowdsource
49:30 - some jokes
49:31 - give me your jokes just don't post them
49:35 - in the YouTube chat or the discord post
49:37 - them here I think this one's good it's
49:41 - got a rainbow in it here's another joke
49:45 - okay oh don't use that okay oh well I'm
49:49 - gonna
49:59 - why does Norway have barcodes on their
50:02 - ships because they scan the Navy and oh
50:07 - I forgot that that shuts my music off
50:12 - okay that's a good one
50:15 - what's red and smells like blue paint
50:17 - red boy free API dad jokes random jokes
50:31 - West boss dad jokes ooh Thank You violet
50:35 - that's an excellent one West boss is
50:37 - reliable Oh hmm I'm gonna have to do
50:45 - some data cleaning on this whoo this is
50:52 - awesome
50:53 - oh my god these are coding dad jokes all
50:57 - right we can do some regular expression
50:59 - magic here I think all right so these
51:07 - are all bunch of jokes
51:15 - unfortunately these jokes only work if
51:17 - you get them so the Q & A ones I need to
51:23 - reformat them like this and I don't want
51:27 - the Q & A in there oh how can I do this
51:30 - with a regular expression okay so what
51:34 - I'm looking for fine and replace is I'm
51:38 - looking for it I want it to be a regular
51:39 - expression a line break
51:41 - followed by a line break followed by a
51:44 - colon and space and I want to get rid of
51:50 - all those boom oh I want the space so I
51:56 - don't want to get rid of the space okay
51:59 - so that did that now I don't want the Q
52:01 - I don't need the Q :
52:03 - I mean it's it's it actually will be
52:05 - awesome to have that in the data set
52:06 - because then I would have these like
52:08 - tokens that I can remove and I can know
52:11 - what's the Q and what's the a but right
52:13 - now I think for simplicity let's just
52:16 - get rid of that space place all okay so
52:21 - that's good so now I've got these jokes
52:27 - wait I don't get it
52:33 - password is - oh I get it now password
52:37 - is - a fortnight is two weeks okay
52:40 - now these are all oh yeah these are all
52:45 - G good so I just need to remove the line
52:47 - breaks now right yep all right oh this
52:53 - is good
52:55 - I just want a line that only has oh you
52:58 - can't see my regular expressions sorry I
53:02 - just want I think it's carrot is the
53:04 - beginning of line then like I just want
53:06 - lie and then that's end of line I just
53:07 - want blank lines which is this one how
53:11 - come it's only giving me this one no
53:13 - results oh can I just do this ah yes
53:15 - blank lines replace them all with
53:18 - nothing hmm that's not gonna work
53:25 - how do I replace them all all the blank
53:29 - lines is there a space there actually no
53:32 - is there a line break maybe it's this no
53:35 - that doesn't make any sense
53:36 - oh I can do this if the line breaks at
53:39 - the beginning replace them all perfect
53:42 - all right we've got 154 more jokes so
53:49 - let's go put that in jokes txt we're up
53:56 - to 850 jokes okay what else we got here
54:10 - github let's just you know before I
54:14 - click on these links here I'm looking at
54:21 - this these look on first glance on first
54:25 - glance these look fine like my name is
54:28 - bond James Bond so I didn't mean to have
54:35 - so many like computer jokes computer
54:39 - jokes okay oh we're up to a thousand
54:42 - jokes this is good this is the way to do
54:44 - it
54:46 - computer puns a giant list of puns have
54:51 - you heard of the band oh sorry
54:53 - have you heard of the band 1020 three
54:55 - megabytes they haven't got a gig yet oh
54:57 - I love that that is awesome a giant list
55:02 - of puns master puns JSON block this oh
55:09 - yeah a lot of these I already have so
55:11 - there might be some duplicates
55:12 - duplicates but this looks good you know
55:17 - you can't go wrong with a giant list of
55:18 - puns oh I'm gonna have to remove the
55:23 - blank lines again which was just
55:27 - beginning of line line break let's
55:30 - remove all those okay and let's go back
55:35 - to here pun punch line hmm okay I want
55:43 - to turn this into plain text I wonder if
55:52 - that's worth just doing here with a
55:54 - regular expression so for example what I
55:58 - want to get rid of is code to get the
56:08 - jokes so CJ has posted a gist that would
56:16 - be more helpful as a reply to that
56:18 - thread just because I don't have the
56:20 - disk or
56:21 - up on this computer although that's
56:22 - something I certainly could do Bob the
56:25 - Builder sat on a log Bob the Builder got
56:26 - off of the log to go home because he was
56:29 - tired I don't know that I'd get that Oh
56:32 - what do you call a bead that lives in
56:33 - America USB
56:34 - could somebody reformat me these jokes
56:37 - for me
56:39 - thank you I I don't I don't really want
56:44 - to right now what do you get when you
56:48 - cross a snowman with a vampire
56:50 - frostbite actually I was walking by a
56:54 - coffee shop that was where's my phone
56:57 - that was only doing a delivery obviously
56:59 - and take out today in Brooklyn but I
57:03 - took a photo of the joke that was on
57:06 - it's a sign and it was why is green ice
57:09 - cream so serendipitous it was meant to
57:13 - be I don't why is green ice cream so
57:22 - serendipitous it was meant meant to be
57:28 - okay I ignored a taped egg got is saying
57:33 - I ignored your link let's see which one
57:37 - is it this one good oh here we go my 50
57:43 - jokes generated perfect thank you but
57:47 - that's very helpful but we need the
57:50 - script CJ if you wouldn't my I know I'm
57:54 - asking a lot but if you could make the
57:56 - script out put them as just plain text
57:58 - all in one line that would be
58:00 - particularly useful which I mean I
58:05 - should be doing this stuff it is I but
58:07 - you know I like this sort of crowdsource
58:08 - would you rather $400 or a matter baby
58:12 - nothing what's the matter with you I
58:15 - don't know that I guessed that I had a
58:18 - dream last night that I was a muffler I
58:20 - woke up exhausted
58:21 - that's pretty awesome let's see more
58:25 - puns pun this one I can definitely
58:30 - [Music]
58:32 - but okay no no no raw raw this one I can
58:36 - definitely clean with a regular
58:39 - expression so all I want to do is find
58:43 - [Music]
58:44 - the beginning of a line followed by a
58:49 - actually it's I don't even need a
58:51 - regular expression for this curly braket
58:55 - pun : quote so replace all with and
59:01 - nothing no wait why is that not gonna
59:04 - replace all oh because it's only the
59:08 - bracket on the first line sorry replace
59:10 - all and then I want to get rid of quote
59:16 - curly bracket comma replace all okay I'm
59:26 - getting rid of that one I'm just if I
59:28 - see some sort of like obnoxious
59:30 - offensive ones I'm gonna just delete
59:35 - them I don't know what this is this one
59:45 - [Music]
59:47 - okay so I'm trying to get rid of I'm
59:49 - gonna I'm gonna try to clean out these
59:52 - later more methodically but right now
59:57 - we've got thirteen thirty-one jokes it
60:03 - was an emotional wedding even the cake
60:05 - was in tears that's pretty good
60:10 - alright joke one no no no oh just one
60:14 - line yeah I see CJ's just one line
60:17 - alright we're gonna wait for CJ's fifty
60:19 - jokes I think we're actually in pretty
60:21 - good shape what what is the size of this
60:24 - text file right now desktop the text
60:31 - file is ninety kilobytes so we're
60:34 - cooking with gas now I think I got to
60:39 - get up to a hundred a hundred kilobytes
60:41 - to have anything reasonable
60:46 - let's see let's check our what did the
60:50 - duck say when he bought lipstick put it
60:53 - on my bill what you call cheese that
61:06 - isn't yours that's definitely in there
61:07 - because it was the punchline nacho
61:09 - cheese was coming up quite a bit you
61:13 - were supposed to say what is a matter
61:15 - baby don't get it how do you stop a dog
61:23 - barking in the back of the car you put
61:25 - it in the front okay that's good
61:27 - a dhp a DHCP packet walks into a bar and
61:31 - asks for a beer the bartender says here
61:33 - but I'll need that back in an hour
61:34 - I totally get it but I love it
61:43 - what do you call it nervous okay oh this
61:45 - is super helpful but I need these I need
61:48 - a script that just converts these to all
61:49 - one line up to correct format all right
61:54 - here we go
61:54 - a pun is not completely matured until
61:57 - it's full grown this is better than I
62:00 - could have ever imagined all right here
62:03 - we go here's 50 more jokes wonderful now
62:10 - so what you can do anybody watching this
62:13 - can if you want to try you can run this
62:17 - code that CJ wrote which just calls you
62:21 - need an API keys you have to sign up for
62:23 - that an API key like I did and then you
62:25 - just run this node code really quickly
62:27 - and you'll get your 50 jokes you know
62:29 - what what the what the hey ho I'm gonna
62:31 - run it with my API key that was somebody
62:37 - probably used already but let's see what
62:39 - happens so let's go this is weird so
62:43 - ridiculous what I'm doing I'm commenting
62:45 - out my code that went to the other API
62:49 - and putting this one in and I am getting
62:56 - my API key the one that you can't
62:59 - possibly get for me good luck getting
63:03 - that haha and I am putting my API key in
63:11 - here good luck getting that API key
63:17 - everybody and now I am going to run it
63:26 - jokes has already been declared what did
63:28 - I forget to comment out
63:31 - [Music]
63:40 - what's going on here what did I mess up
63:52 - constructs can't joke if joke jokes oh
63:55 - look yeah why that's weird that's
63:59 - actually a bug in the code for reals
64:02 - right Aaron my scripts like jokes too
64:10 - all right can I just do this oh I can't
64:14 - reassign it CJ's updating all okay might
64:25 - just change it to all that's a good way
64:26 - of doing it right just change it to all
64:29 - and then I'd say all ID right no oh no
64:37 - this still stays jokes but I'm writing
64:39 - out all okay great
64:42 - now let me run it see what happens you
64:48 - are not subscribed to this okay Melvin I
64:55 - had sent 66 more jokes boy this is
64:59 - amazing two men walk into a bar the
65:03 - third one ducks I got this one already

65:26 - okay I get it now I got it now what
65:30 - happens when a frog's car breaks down it
65:33 - gets towed away
65:34 - where are my jokes wait what happened to
65:37 - them did I delete them all oh because I
65:39 - ran the script overwrite the file good
65:43 - thing undo works oh my god I'm the worst
65:47 - programmer who ever livestreams late at
65:51 - night don't code and late at night go to
65:55 - sleep go to bed stay in school go to bed
65:58 - sleep a long time I think we're in
66:03 - pretty good shape here let's keep going
66:04 - sixty-six more Joe
66:08 - these are ok let's well let's do this
66:11 - all right let's grab these jokes
66:15 - trusting all you people where do young
66:18 - cows eat lunch in the cafeteria if if
66:24 - you walk in a forest and cut down a tree
66:25 - but the tree doesn't understand why you
66:27 - cut it down do you think it's stumped
66:31 - but we were still have to train the
66:33 - model
66:33 - why do Java programmers wear glasses
66:35 - because they don't see sharp I'm pretty
66:37 - sure that one's in there already but I
66:39 - love it I like telling job dad jokes
66:41 - sometimes he laughs gypsy dangerous got
66:49 - us some jokes all right save we are now
66:54 - almost up to 1,500 jokes hmm let's see
67:01 - what's our file looking like now 101
67:03 - kilobytes that is all we need so now all
67:08 - we need to do is uh train our model time
67:17 - to train the model so I'm gonna go into
67:19 - runway move myself over here I'm gonna
67:24 - go to training I'm gonna train a new
67:26 - text model I'm gonna call this dad
67:33 - coding train dad joke jokes create I'm
67:40 - going to upload a new data set let's
67:45 - rename this file I'm gonna call it just
67:50 - for right now I'm just gonna call it
67:52 - jokes - oh I can't rename it right here
67:55 - whatever fine I don't care
67:58 - open jokes - is uploaded great and it
68:05 - didn't complain that I didn't have
68:06 - enough data thank you very much I'm
68:08 - gonna go to next I'm gonna say why did
68:13 - the chicken so this is an interesting
68:16 - thing to point out here which is that
68:18 - what
68:19 - I was talking before about how I'm doing
68:22 - I'm fine-tuning an existing model and
68:24 - ultimately it might be interesting for
68:26 - me to try using a medium sized model but
68:29 - it's gonna take much longer to train and
68:31 - I've got to go to bed and I do want to
68:33 - train what's modeled so I'm definitely
68:35 - to use the extra small model and you can
68:37 - see here that sort of grayed out is
68:39 - large and extra large so maybe those
68:41 - will become available in runway at some
68:42 - point I could actually start also
68:45 - training from another model that I've
68:48 - previously trained but let's just let's
68:50 - leave it at a thousand steps let's use
68:54 - the line as the data separator why is
68:58 - this overlay up there I gotta just get
69:00 - rid of that there we go
69:02 - and I'm gonna start training so great so
69:08 - this now is gonna take a while
69:12 - we are you if you watch the late-night
69:14 - show on Monday night you're very
69:17 - familiar with this calculating ETA so
69:22 - I'm gonna one of the nice things about
69:25 - runway so so this training process is
69:27 - actually not happening locally it's
69:30 - happening in the cloud and it's only
69:32 - available actually if you have a
69:33 - subscription to runway but so I'm gonna
69:37 - move off of that and I'm going to go and
69:41 - look at my list I'm gonna come back to
69:44 - it actually let's stick with this and
69:47 - while it's training let's look up work
69:50 - on some other I really want to do the
69:51 - hulex but I'm never gonna get to that
69:53 - let's let me close this stuff let's go
69:58 - back to glitch where last night I was
70:04 - attempting to create the dad like a
70:08 - little node app that would query the
70:11 - model I trained in runway and display it
70:13 - on a web page so that I could then have
70:15 - that web page permanently as an overlay
70:17 - and I could just be running new dad
70:20 - jokes or something so let's edit this
70:23 - project and let's see if last night a
70:26 - glitch was down so I actually wasn't
70:28 - able to even try to get it to work so
70:31 - let's go to show
70:32 - in a new window let's see if this comes
70:35 - up is glitched let's look at glitch
70:37 - status just to make sure it's up um well
70:44 - it's not a good sign
70:47 - degraded performance so excited to
70:55 - finally use glitch I had this perfect
70:56 - reason to use it and now it says
71:01 - degraded performance well degraded
71:03 - performance is better last night it was
71:04 - completely red this seems kind of like a
71:10 - degraded performance and Here I am
71:15 - thinking that maybe someday I could
71:16 - convince glitch to be a sponsor of the
71:18 - coding train oh well so that's not gonna
71:27 - work alright so I'm gonna leave that be
71:29 - I'm gonna come back to this another time
71:31 - I'm gonna move to trying to control the
71:34 - hue light that's really what I wanted to
71:36 - do and it's a reason for me to have my
71:37 - video on and not have a green screen so
71:40 - let's go back to that so I'm gonna go
71:42 - over here to terminal I am going to go
71:45 - to my other project which was called
71:48 - just lights and open that up and take a
71:54 - look at this code so one of the things I
71:56 - actually did do a little bit of research
71:58 - and here I go again with my secret
72:00 - username to control all the lights in my
72:02 - house I don't know that I've got some I
72:05 - don't think you can get in here with
72:06 - that and that I can reset probably but
72:11 - what I realized actually is this code
72:14 - from Tom I goes examples is actually the
72:16 - version two of the node hue API module
72:21 - and that's why it wasn't running it's
72:23 - not compatible with the version of the
72:26 - no to you API that I installed which is
72:27 - version 3 and now maybe version 4 even
72:29 - so there's like a shim type thing that I
72:31 - could get it make it backwards
72:32 - compatible but I think I'm going to
72:33 - start a bit but new again and I'm gonna
72:36 - go to
72:38 - this the the node so this is the module
72:44 - I'm using it's called node hue API
72:46 - yesterday if you tuned in last night it
72:48 - actually I'm able to control the lights
72:49 - just through simple HTTP requests but I
72:53 - think it's probably worth learning how
72:54 - to use this this node module which will
72:58 - just be a lot more powerful so let me
72:59 - look at this discover and connect to the
73:01 - hue bridge for the first time and let me
73:03 - see if I can you'll get this to work
73:05 - that's a lot of code and then I want
73:10 - somebody to research how do I set my how
73:13 - do I reset my hue and hue certain a
73:17 - secret username and a cub man cub man
73:24 - rights you should let viewers control
73:26 - your lights exactly so the plan is to
73:29 - have some sort of thing where I'm
73:31 - probably to start certainly just a
73:33 - discord bot so you could control them
73:35 - from discord but I might see if I can
73:39 - interface with the YouTube chat API as
73:41 - well or just create a website that
73:43 - people glitch app but people could log
73:46 - into and control the lights alright so I
73:48 - don't really want it I'm just gonna copy
73:50 - paste all this code into here and let's
73:53 - just see what happens I mean I'm node
74:01 - index such as the link button on the
74:04 - bridge was not pressed please press the
74:07 - link button and try again all right so
74:10 - now is the time where I'm going to walk
74:12 - over to the link button and press it and
74:17 - I should check let's check on the runway
74:20 - model by the way oh
74:24 - just 10 minutes remaining this is
74:26 - amazing it's training it so fast so
74:29 - we're gonna be done with this very soon
74:30 - that's awesome I'm uh I think you could
74:36 - still hear me I should check the battery
74:40 - yet it's still have two bars on my
74:41 - battery and now pressing the button
74:44 - doesn't seem to do anything when I press
74:46 - the button but
74:47 - says that's what I'm supposed to do I'm
74:50 - back over in my seat and why did the
74:56 - chicken it was tender I'm gonna go back
74:59 - here and run this code again all right
75:06 - user has been good now if I do this over
75:08 - and over again
75:09 - I'll will give me a new user like all
75:12 - this secret stuff will it do it every
75:14 - single time like different all right
75:19 - this is like this is the coding train in
75:25 - a nutshell you should treat this like a
75:28 - password there it is for you right there
75:35 - all right so I'm gonna see I'm gonna
75:38 - let's open up the let's open up runway
75:41 - I'm gonna go press the button again I'm
75:43 - assuming every time I press the button
75:45 - it generates a new user name and client
75:48 - key I'm gonna just hope for that so I'm
75:51 - going over to press the button again
75:55 - I dropped the microphone I'm so sorry
75:59 - I hope this sound is still okay looks
76:02 - like it's okay go press the button again
76:16 - and I'm coming back
76:21 - all right here I am back and I am
76:24 - switching to the camera now you can only
76:31 - see me you can't see my screen and I am
76:37 - now about to run that code again and I'm
76:41 - really hoping the bridge user and the
76:42 - user client key will look different
76:45 - oh the link button was not pressed so
76:53 - everything okay all right all right
76:55 - you're gonna I'm gonna leave this on and
76:57 - I'm gonna go try to press it again
77:12 - you know I just it occurred to me that I
77:14 - could actually just I happen to have a
77:16 - lot of computer equipment and
77:19 - electricity and networking cables right
77:24 - here where I'm sitting that I probably
77:26 - could just put the bridge right here and
77:28 - I could press the button as many times
77:30 - as I want we could see it through your
77:32 - glasses that if you can do that then
77:34 - please have at it
77:35 - all right I have a new bridge user and a
77:38 - new client key that you cannot see so
77:42 - I'm going over to the code and I am
77:46 - going to wait oh you can see okay I'm
77:51 - gonna I'm going to create a dot env file
77:57 - dot env and I'm pasting them in the dot
78:00 - env file equals client key equals client
78:11 - key equals so I have a dot env file that
78:14 - I'm now closing I am now clearing my
78:19 - terminal and now I can bring you back
78:22 - whoops to the code all right so in
78:26 - theory if I look at the code as long as
78:30 - I don't click on this dot env file as
78:37 - long as I don't click on the dot env
78:38 - file I should be okay so now what I can
78:42 - do is I can go to back to this website
78:46 - and the example that I want to look at
78:48 - is actually set a light state so so let
78:53 - me grab all this and whoops go back to
79:00 - here and this is sort of terrible what
79:03 - I'm doing but I'm gonna paste this in
79:05 - and so I'm requiring getting light
79:07 - States the user name is now do I say
79:11 - process env dot user name I don't know
79:17 - if that's what I called it so sorry hold
79:20 - on a second
79:22 - to go here I called it I called it just
79:25 - user so I'm gonna actually change it to
79:27 - username in the dot env file and so
79:31 - that's correct and I think I can show it
79:34 - to you but I think what I need to do is
79:36 - make sure dot env is installed so I'm
79:42 - installing the dot env module if only I
79:44 - could remember how to do it good thing I
79:48 - have that discord bot code somewhere I
79:50 - can close all these all these extra
79:54 - jokes and you keep this open for sure
80:00 - is this where I can find its just
80:07 - required dot e NV dot config so that's
80:11 - what I'm looking for so then I should
80:15 - just be able to have this so I think I'm
80:18 - good right because to get yes process
80:21 - env that's what it looks like I just say
80:23 - process T and V and I can get that other
80:25 - okay so that's secret you can't see it
80:28 - can't see it then the light idea pretty
80:32 - sure I remember from yesterday that the
80:34 - light behind me the ID number is five
80:37 - because that's something I searched for
80:39 - search get the IP address connect
80:42 - username light on blue new light state
80:46 - on I don't know what CT is the
80:52 - brightness is obviously the brightness
80:54 - is this like the hue or something
80:55 - satellite state state light state was
80:58 - successful okay let's try this all right
81:05 - unexpected token at where line seven
81:17 - okay
81:18 - oh that changed
81:22 - oh yeah that worked so what I need to
81:30 - look at the documentation alright let's
81:34 - look at the documentation light state
81:42 - API where's the API Doc's light state
81:47 - object so light state is on white it's a
81:53 - color brightness saturation on/off
81:58 - brightness hue so I can do a hue value
82:02 - CT what is CT mired color temperature ah
82:07 - so that's if it wasn't if it was one of
82:11 - these I guess I know what to call them
82:14 - they're just white lights but they have
82:16 - adjustable color temperature so I want
82:21 - to change this to hue and can I make an
82:24 - animation so first of all I don't want
82:27 - to do all this searching that seems
82:28 - crazy like why can't I just know in
82:35 - advance the IP address and can I also
82:39 - want to change this to a sink and a
82:40 - weight cuz all this let me see if I can
82:43 - rewrite this a little bit to make this
82:45 - understand a little more so I'm gonna do
82:46 - turn light on I'm just gonna write a
82:49 - function I'm gonna make it an async
82:51 - function called turn light on and in
82:56 - this function let's see if I can get
83:01 - this to work in a way that I can kind of
83:03 - understand it better so I'm gonna say
83:08 - search results equals a weight this so
83:16 - this is I guess this is like searching
83:18 - for the the hub or whatever the hue hub
83:22 - I don't know what any of this stuff is
83:23 - then I should be able to after this is
83:26 - done just say the host hears
83:29 - IP address so this is something I could
83:32 - do at the beginning and then this is a
83:33 - new function call where I want to say I
83:37 - guess API equals await this so I'm just
83:41 - again I have a whole set of videos about
83:44 - promises and how they work and then how
83:47 - you can use async and await with them so
83:52 - then what I want to do is I I can create
83:55 - this light state and then I can say oh
83:58 - wait I should be able to just say result
84:07 - equals a weight set the light state and
84:13 - then console.log light state was
84:19 - successful result so I'm hoping that
84:22 - this code that I've written that you can
84:26 - mostly see here is a little bit
84:30 - friendlier to look at and this is
84:34 - definitely something that I could just
84:35 - do once like basically all I need is to
84:39 - get the IP address which I actually know
84:42 - so like I know what the IP address is it
84:44 - I had it in the code I wrote yesterday
84:46 - and I've but I'll just it's finite it's
84:52 - a might as well search for it so now
84:54 - let's see if I say turn light on so let
84:56 - me first just actually turn the light
84:59 - off I'm going to use just the hue app so
85:03 - I'm now UPS I now just turn the light
85:06 - off so it's off behind me so now I'm
85:09 - hoping that when I run this code there
85:15 - we go okay I have to have to have to
85:18 - create a p5 sketch where I could just
85:20 - drag my mouse around and set the color
85:23 - of the light so but I kind of want to
85:26 - just try an animation first so what if I
85:29 - did for let I equals 0
85:34 - like I'm gonna say H equals 0 h4 q H is
85:37 - less than 360
85:40 - H+ plus I'm like afraid I keep like
85:46 - thinking the lights changing in some
85:48 - attacked okay and I'm going to do this
85:52 - and I'm gonna set the hue what I'm gonna
85:56 - set the hue to this H value now this is
85:59 - probably a horrific Allah bad idea
86:02 - because I think it's going to cycle
86:04 - through all the hues way too fast I'm
86:06 - gonna need to build in some kind of
86:07 - delay probably but let's just see what
86:09 - what happens did it run through all the
86:15 - different hues I don't think so well and
86:21 - I got an error
86:23 - maybe the hues aren't between 0 and 360
86:26 - oh wait it's that's terrible to look for
86:32 - hue oh it's a wrapping value between 0 &
86:39 - 6 5 5 3 5
86:42 - holy moly okay well that's interesting
86:47 - let's try commenting out this
86:49 - console.log actually let's leave it in
86:51 - there let's I don't see I don't even see
87:01 - it changing like to read it should be
87:06 - read right if I do this the light should
87:14 - be red
87:20 - oops no no semicolon there so how come
87:28 - it didn't change it to red what did I do
87:31 - wrong
87:37 - brightness values scale from 1 to 254 0
87:43 - to 100 hue and let's just try this value
87:51 - anybody know why this is not oh it's
87:58 - green that worked so zero just wasn't
88:03 - red let's try let's try this should be
88:06 - blue
88:12 - that's not very blue
88:23 - Oh Thank You CJ is giving me my delay
88:26 - which is super helpful but I don't
88:31 - understand why the hue is not working
88:33 - well let's just do this
88:48 - Oh H is not defined whoops let's put
88:51 - this back in and see what happens now
88:54 - I'll see if I need a delay it seems like
88:56 - it has kind of a little bit of a delay
88:58 - anyway all right
89:01 - wow that's low I should actually oh and
89:04 - why did it crash - maybe I'm doing it
89:12 - too fast so first of all let me move
89:15 - this up by like 250 I want to see it
89:22 - cycle 2 different colors
89:24 - Oh saturation maybe I needs more
89:27 - saturation a dazzle a so I definitely
89:29 - want to add the delay which I can write
89:32 - a function delay by some milliseconds
89:39 - like Millie's I want to say a wait new
89:45 - promise by the way I'm not doing this
89:50 - code I'm looking at the code that was
89:53 - posted by CJ in the discord set timeout
89:56 - resolved Millie's think this is right
90:02 - this is a quick promise to do a bit of a
90:06 - delay and then I can say a wait delay
90:10 - 100 mil easy think I need these
90:16 - parentheses here it's one little let's
90:20 - see if this works
90:20 - Oh a so we need to say async function
90:26 - and also let's let's add in saturation
90:29 - so saturation zero white 254 is most
90:34 - colored I can also do it as a percentage
90:36 - which I much prefer to do so let's also
90:39 - do dot saturation 100 all right we're
90:46 - gonna give this a try everybody and I'm
90:48 - sure the machine learning model is
90:49 - totally done by now and I still have
90:53 - because I can't stop putting semicolons
90:56 - where they aren't supposed to be
91:00 - oh there we go okay there we go oh that
91:09 - is just wonderful oh I love this my node
91:17 - code is controlling it's like so so
91:20 - here's the question like what do I do
91:21 - right now
91:22 - I really should just go to bed it's
91:23 - 12:30 a.m. I have to wake up very early
91:26 - these children do not sleep in actually
91:29 - kind of do but I got to get up I have to
91:31 - walk the dog where's the dog Gloria come
91:34 - here she's sleeping over there yeah I
91:39 - have a little bed for her right here and
91:40 - I have a dog cam so what I want to do is
91:45 - create a discord bot I think I could do
91:49 - this pretty quickly and that's the thing
91:51 - let's check on the dad bot let's check
91:53 - on the the dead dad bot let's check on
91:58 - the the joke model it took 15 minutes
92:03 - the perplexity is at forty six point oh
92:06 - seven I talked a little bit about
92:08 - perplexity last night but basically I
92:10 - want a low perplexity and since I had
92:13 - such little data I'm actually probably
92:15 - ironically going to have a much better
92:17 - perplexity at this checkpoint of only
92:19 - 250 iterations through the training so
92:23 - I'm gonna actually keep that I'm gonna
92:25 - change the default check point to the
92:32 - 250th step so let's set as default and
92:40 - then I want to add this to my workspace
92:45 - I'll try later on let's try running this
92:50 - model so we're back to the jokes by the
92:52 - way which definitely means I need my
92:54 - time my laugh track ready
92:56 - why does my code not work
93:05 - let's see because it's not compiled and
93:14 - if you remember I can change the seed
93:17 - and get a different now I don't know now
93:24 - I'm just starting from scratch trace
93:30 - back github.com slash jacuzzi was my
93:39 - code not work one word inheritance too
93:51 - much good ok this is much this is way
94:00 - too good let's go to let's go to my p5
94:07 - sketch I'd rather get it in p5 here
94:14 - because I can kind of do more what what
94:16 - did the for-loop say to the while loop
94:18 - I'll just leave you an explanation
94:22 - look I'm get some glue on the ends tie
94:38 - tie and call take a second to support
94:53 - [Music]
94:56 - this is like too good to be true I can't
95:00 - even tell you how amazing this is ok so
95:04 - this is good so we've got a couple
95:06 - things I can try here number one is I
95:11 - could you know very quickly I could make
95:13 - a discord bot that's not very quickly it
95:16 - would not be quick I mean
95:18 - maybe this waits till next week but the
95:21 - idea is to make or are you not hearing
95:25 - the laugh track it's just too quiet it's
95:28 - so much funnier when you have the laugh
95:29 - track let's just okay wait wait what did
95:34 - the for-loop say to the wild let's just
95:36 - say there's a second loop and we get a
95:38 - constant what's another good question I
95:45 - can ask what does a sync
95:51 - what did a sync say to a wait insert the
95:59 - line between a and a not look to a wait
96:05 - let's do it what is the fact that it had
96:22 - the parentheses there is pretty amazing
96:23 - what an a6 they don't wait call it a
96:25 - sync
96:26 - I don't know about that they sing yes do
96:35 - I see a second async/await do I want to
96:38 - hear a second AC put pieces feel like
96:45 - I'm glad you understand
96:47 - [Laughter]
96:50 - all right
96:52 - how do ID bug cuz my server is down why
97:02 - do you get checkout get checkout
97:08 - how do I think I've even thought about
97:12 - okay so this clearly works okay okay
97:24 - this is amazing and this is also amazing
97:29 - both of these things are amazing
97:32 - together now it's 1234 a.m. and I
97:36 - definitely should go to sleep and I feel
97:38 - very satisfied with both of these
97:40 - results I'm like well on my way to
97:42 - making these projects work the way I
97:43 - want them to but I sort of feel like
97:46 - maybe really against my better judgment
97:49 - I should just really quickly try to make
97:54 - it a a discord bot because then I could
98:02 - because I'm not gonna be back until
98:04 - Monday
98:05 - and I feel like it might be fun to play
98:07 - around with that a little bit in play
98:13 - around with this a little bit with the
98:14 - community and the discord over the
98:16 - weekend so first of all join the discord
98:20 - there's the link if you are you if
98:23 - you're a coding trade member there's
98:24 - some private channels so I'm let me see
98:27 - let me figure this out so thankfully
98:29 - thanks again to see the coding trade has
98:33 - now become to CJ have information on how
98:36 - I can do this
98:37 - great then I'm going to go ahead and do
98:39 - it so let me go to because this is just
98:44 - wait I'm having way too much fun to stop
98:46 - now
98:47 - glitch is still unfortunate I can't use
98:50 - glitch I will come back to that later
98:52 - let's go back to seed or the example
98:55 - discord bot which I don't know what
98:58 - happened to it and let's clone this reap
99:04 - so yes oh this is the problem with doing
99:17 - my live streaming from a fresh login
99:20 - that I've never used before so I'm just
99:22 - going to unfortunately I hate that I'm
99:24 - doing this but I'm not gonna
99:26 - authenticate this computer to github
99:29 - later and I'm just gonna clone it
99:33 - without being like authenticated and
99:36 - here and I'm gonna go into here now one
99:40 - thing that I need to do in order to make
99:43 - this work is I need to open and I would
99:47 - love I don't know if there's any admins
99:48 - right now in who are in the discord I
99:51 - want to set up a channel that the
99:54 - permissions are only I can post to it
99:58 - maybe I'll maybe let anybody with the
99:59 - supporter I guess I could do right now
100:01 - just anybody with the support or role
100:02 - can post to it but I want everyone to be
100:06 - able to see it is there anybody who's
100:08 - like watching right and I think David if
100:10 - you're still watching I know you have
100:12 - permissions but if you could set up a
100:15 - channel in the discord called bot
100:17 - testing thanks - so yeah the coding
100:20 - trade is that's a good one sponsored by
100:24 - CJ set up a channel and I'm gonna just
100:31 - go to just the camera here and I'm gonna
100:33 - see if I can if I'm not even logged into
100:35 - discord on this computer I just don't
100:37 - want to pull up anybody's private
100:39 - information by accident I can definitely
100:41 - set that there's that mode on discord
100:43 - which is like the stream safe mode or
100:47 - whatever what's it called what's it
100:49 - called if I go to my settings I can go
100:54 - to streamer mode enable streamer mode so
100:58 - I've now got streamer mode enabled so
101:02 - that hopefully the what I hate about
101:03 - this is right here on my screen or all
101:06 - my direct messages not the messages but
101:09 - the icons of the people and how many
101:10 - unread messages
101:11 - have I mean do and all the other
101:13 - channels I'm a part of like I don't want
101:15 - to show that is there where to hide that
101:16 - column and maybe I shouldn't care about
101:18 - this so much but okay David is on it so
101:23 - I'm going to wait for that to get
101:27 - resolved and I'm gonna start looking at
101:30 - the steps in that CJ outlines here so
101:35 - NPM i discord dot E and V so I since
101:39 - this is the since this project is
101:42 - already set up I'm pretty sure I can
101:45 - just do just do NPM install okay so
101:53 - that's good that should be done setup
101:56 - yes lint I mean you know it's not really
101:59 - my thing but I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm a
102:01 - completionist I'm gonna follow these
102:03 - instructions as written and I do want to
102:06 - learn more about this yes lint stuff and
102:08 - how to make it work properly I'm just
102:12 - gonna do check syntax and find problems
102:14 - right now
102:16 - I don't know what I'm doing I don't use
102:19 - react no help help where's my code run
102:24 - it runs a node right now
102:26 - it's JavaScript okay
102:29 - add the bots to the server I'll create a
102:32 - disk or application so what I need to do
102:36 - is open up the discord website and log
102:39 - in I think so far I'm good until I just
102:43 - don't want to just click to reveal thing
102:45 - so I think I can continue to I can log
102:51 - in and don't please do not okay do not
102:57 - scan that QR code I'm gonna do it myself
103:00 - I mean if you scan it it's gonna log
103:04 - into your account you don't want to do
103:05 - that I'll be logged in as you let me go
103:10 - and log in this is good that I'm do this
103:14 - that I want to make a sort of proper set
103:15 - of tutorials about making a discord bot
103:17 - but a scan QR code so I am logged in I
103:22 - think I need a little relaxing music
103:25 - yes log me in and now logged in
103:29 - [Music]
103:31 - and then I want to go to general go to
103:38 - the development okay
103:43 - so I can think I could show this to you
103:45 - so this is the developer portal and
103:48 - we'll turn the music down so this is the
103:53 - developer portal I actually have a bot
103:55 - that I made for the ITP program here so
103:58 - I can create a new application we're
104:00 - gonna call this dad bot I mean the
104:03 - question is am I gonna do the hue light
104:06 - I can do the dad jokes let's just do the
104:08 - dad jokes right now call it dad bot and
104:13 - so this is precisely what I don't want
104:17 - to do I could reveal it then I would
104:18 - have to regenerate so what I'm going to
104:20 - do is take you away from here I'm gonna
104:23 - click to reveal and copy it I'm going to
104:27 - go to the dot env sample file so now
104:31 - what you're seeing here is I'm in the
104:35 - sample file that CJ set up and I'm going
104:38 - to rename it to just dot env and then
104:44 - I'm going to paste in my token but I'm
104:46 - gonna pull the screen away from you
104:48 - paste it in and actually I I'm gonna
104:52 - need to do that the I just want the bot
104:54 - only to be in a specific Channel so I'll
104:58 - get that in a second all right so now
105:05 - what am I doing here I kind of have a
105:12 - renewed energy
105:12 - strangely enough but I just need to
105:14 - close that file and then make sure it's
105:18 - no longer on the I want to hide it
105:22 - please hide it
105:26 - okay it's hiding it so oh I can go back
105:31 - here okay so then I want to go back to
105:34 - the steps and add the bots to the server
105:39 - [Music]
105:40 - so let's add the bots to the server so
105:44 - oh right I do this but instead of
105:50 - whatever nonsense is here I go and get
105:53 - the actual client ID which is this and I
105:58 - paste it in here so I should be able to
106:05 - hit enter
106:06 - Oh auth application does not have a bot
106:11 - oh I think I did something wrong
106:17 - I might have done something wrong
106:21 - oh I need to actually create a bot silly
106:26 - me
106:27 - oh this is where is this the toque I'm
106:32 - so confused
106:33 - what's the difference between this
106:34 - general information client secret that's
106:37 - different than this token so so I also
106:43 - want that so let me just copy this which
106:46 - you can't see I forgot what the
106:48 - difference between these things are I'm
106:51 - going back to my env file debt that's
106:53 - not the bot token that was like the
106:55 - client secret which I'm going to not
106:58 - bother with right now I can get that
107:00 - again
107:01 - let me try once again going back whoops
107:05 - ah there we go so now now that I created
107:12 - that it's saying add this to a server
107:16 - and I'm gonna add this to the coding
107:18 - train server and I'm gonna hit authorize
107:24 - not a robot I think supporters is fine
107:31 - David I don't really I'm not I think
107:34 - it's it's fine whatever we're just
107:37 - testing it right now we'll figure it out
107:38 - later
107:39 - the other tab is for OAuth 2 yeah okay
107:42 - so now the bot should be in the discord
107:46 - and you know what I could maybe do is
107:49 - actually just go back to discord app.com
107:55 - and go to
108:07 - all right so now I need to go to coding
108:11 - train and is the channel available for
108:16 - me to go into and is the bot somewhere
108:21 - so I'm looking for the bot dad bot I
108:29 - know you can't see I really yeah there I
108:32 - see dad bot okay so everyone welcome dad
108:36 - bought who was waiting to board so I
108:38 - think I should probably alright let me
108:42 - show you what I've got here I think so
108:44 - this is the dad but now I remember when
108:46 - we did this before CJ there was a thing
108:49 - where it like somewhere during the steps
108:50 - it like asked me if I wanted the bot to
108:52 - be an admin I think I should just make
108:55 - it a conductor which is like the admin
108:57 - and I can get rid of this waiting to
108:59 - board so I think I just made the bot
109:02 - have permissions for everything so I
109:06 - think that makes sense to do right now
109:08 - so there's the bot and what channel am I
109:12 - supposed to be using David is it by any
109:15 - chance available in bot testing can I
109:19 - just use bot testing welcome to bots
109:24 - testing so let's just see if I can if I
109:31 - mention at dad bot there we go okay so I
109:35 - am now in the bot testing Channel and
109:40 - this is where I want to experiment with
109:43 - the dad bot right so let's look at the
109:50 - code and oh if the bots there
109:57 - oh I'm not running it let me try running
109:59 - it what do I just do a NPM start maybe
110:05 - okay the bots running so if I go back to
110:09 - discord thank you for this channel ID
110:15 - and if i zoom in on this a bit more and
110:18 - we say
110:19 - oh I don't have to mention how's this
110:23 - work
110:23 - I forgot what I do how's the example
110:27 - work I typed like this exclamation point
110:31 - something and it like both like 8-ball
110:36 - maybe oh oh the kit robes yeah different
110:41 - bot came to talk to me oh I probably I
110:45 - have to do the channel ID all right I've
110:47 - got to enable it to listen to this
110:48 - particular channel okay a server ID and
110:52 - the channel ID thank you I forgot about
110:53 - those steps okay so I'm going to update
110:57 - the in the env file the channel ID what
111:04 - is the server ID where do I grab that
111:07 - that must be a copy ID I think I've got
111:12 - it so I'm gonna show you this very
111:17 - briefly I'm zoomed in on it
111:19 - so this is this is what my env file
111:21 - looks like guild ID I guess for whatever
111:24 - reason discord the original term it's
111:26 - called a guild
111:27 - because we're all just living in a D&D
111:30 - campaign but the channel ID is for that
111:34 - particular about testing channel and the
111:36 - guild ID is the and then the bots token
111:39 - is on line one of this file that you
111:41 - can't see okay so now if I close this
111:50 - and come back to the file I should be
111:53 - able to let's try running it again and
111:58 - what are the commands oh I mean live
112:05 - chat here whoops bot testing see okay so
112:13 - I forgot what the commands are does
112:15 - anybody remember
112:16 - 8ball outlook good wasn't that one of
112:22 - the commands I guess I can look at the
112:27 - code command 8-ball
112:32 - oh it needs arguments ping let's try
112:36 - ping is a good test yay
112:41 - ping okay the bot is working perfect so
112:46 - now all I need to do is have the bot so
112:50 - I'm gonna create a new command let's go
112:53 - back to here I'm gonna create a new
112:55 - command I guess let's just use I guess
113:00 - the eight ball eight ball is probably
113:02 - the best one in terms of to start with
113:05 - so let's duplicate this file now let's
113:09 - create a new file we're gonna call it
113:12 - joke dot J s and let's paste this in and
113:18 - basically I want to prompt I think I I
113:25 - want to prompt right now so basically
113:30 - what I want to do is if there's no
113:32 - arguments I'll just do return and then
113:36 - the argument I want is well let's just
113:42 - test it out by saying prompt equals args
113:51 - index zero oh is it gonna be do I get
113:56 - can I get the whole sentence I forget
113:59 - and then message author and just a send
114:05 - back the prompt let's see if this works
114:08 - and then in index J s require commands
114:16 - so I need to add a command which would
114:20 - be a joke right just add this doesn't
114:29 - like it's very unhappy with all of my oh
114:32 - yeah and I say Const joke equals
114:37 - required joke there's a lot of Visual
114:41 - Studio code does not like my code at all
114:44 - [Music]
114:47 - and now let's go to ACTU bot testing and
114:56 - we rerun this and I'm going to say joke
115:08 - hi
115:10 - great joke what does the code do ah so
115:17 - so I need to join all of the arguments
115:20 - back so the each of those words are
115:22 - separate arguments I want the whole
115:23 - thing as a prompt so that's that's no
115:26 - big deal I'll change the code to say in
115:35 - joke KS prompt is args join I guess
115:42 - we're the space yeah because that's
115:45 - what's separating them so join with a
115:47 - space and then I think I can move on
115:50 - from here and I can go back to runway
115:54 - and I can go to network and JavaScript
115:59 - and I want to fetch I want to use
116:11 - tonight I think I used HTTP I want to
116:14 - use this so let's go into here so I'm
116:20 - gonna paste all this code from runway
116:21 - here this is an async function so I can
116:26 - say let's do I'm gonna rewrite this a
116:29 - little bit the options of what I want to
116:32 - post to runway are all of these things I
116:39 - want to get the response from fetching
116:45 - this URL with the options then I want to
116:55 - say
116:57 - the JSON I guess outputs equals a weight
117:05 - response JSON
117:08 - we're gonna do I'm gonna do though I'm
117:10 - gonna have to wait I'm not gonna be able
117:13 - to do the lights tonight that'll come
117:14 - next week
117:16 - oh wait fetch a weight response JSON
117:22 - output then I can say this this is just
117:34 - that object D structuring stuff and
117:36 - actually I really I only need the
117:41 - generated text I don't need this
117:43 - encountered end thing so I think I can
117:46 - do this
117:47 - oh really
117:57 - oh I'm just gonna say this now I'm going
118:00 - to say outputs dot generated text so I
118:05 - mean what's the chance that I wrote this
118:08 - code correctly oh so this prompt now is
118:11 - now this the max number of characters is
118:16 - what did I have it in the in the model
118:18 - itself when I was doing it here I guess
118:23 - it didn't say but I'll just make that
118:28 - you know whatever I'll make it 1024
118:31 - let's use 0.9 as the top P and the seed
118:35 - I want this to be random so I need a
118:39 - random number I'm just gonna say R
118:41 - equals math dot random times 1000 and
118:46 - then I will say math dot floor so I
118:49 - think it needs to be an integer and that
118:52 - will be the seed and that should be good
118:58 - so if I get some if I get some arguments
119:01 - I will join all those arguments create
119:05 - the input to run way post this to run
119:07 - way get the response turn it into JSON
119:10 - and send the generated text its
119:14 - generated text back let me just make
119:17 - sure that's what it's called the output
119:19 - specification is generated text yep I
119:24 - don't I'm not worried about this
119:25 - encountered end property okay so now let
119:32 - me run the bot what's the chance this is
119:35 - gonna work is everybody still there
119:40 - David if you could make sure out what
119:42 - the permission should be that all
119:44 - supporters can post in bot testing and
119:47 - all members can view bot testing and
119:50 - then eventually will deploy this to the
119:53 - broader discord community okay so now
119:57 - I'm going back to discord and uh NPM
120:04 - thank you I've got a nice message here
120:06 - from CJ saying I forgot NPM install node
120:10 - fetch
120:11 - so thank you about that weirdly so let
120:17 - me install NPM node fetch and then where
120:24 - am I going here and then also I'm gonna
120:26 - need that where do I need the in where
120:29 - does the import go does it go here like
120:38 - is this right like if I put this here no
120:41 - I this needs to be on the actual this
120:44 - javascript file right let's hope this
120:48 - works
120:54 - whoops okay
121:10 - well that didn't seem to work
121:13 - oh I'm not running the model
121:16 - I'm not running the model so what error
121:19 - message did it give me interestingly it
121:22 - didn't give me a math and error message
121:23 - I mean the effect the request didn't go
121:28 - through that's fine
121:29 - no worries the model is now running and
121:37 - here we go we now have the discord bot
121:55 - all right I'm just gonna let you all
122:02 - read these to you
122:05 - let's see where can i what can I put
122:08 - myself maybe I could just unlock myself
122:11 - here very briefly oops and just move
122:16 - myself up here ok so please what does
122:21 - the rainbow do what does the rainbow do
122:23 - it relishes the light what is 1 plus 1
122:29 - what is 1 plus 1 2 equals 1 2 equals 1
122:34 - [Applause]
122:41 - why did the chicken cross the road why
122:44 - did the chicken cross the road
122:45 - made from hole okay hold on I've got to
122:50 - shut this down because I realize there's
122:52 - something really important that I need
122:53 - to do so I'm gonna shut this down I'm
122:59 - gonna I'm gonna stop the model from
123:00 - running because I want to host this
123:03 - model um this is a really important step
123:05 - here which is that I don't I don't want
123:11 - to have to refer this while this BOTS
123:13 - running I want to be able to deploy this
123:15 - but I don't want to have to like model
123:16 - runway application running here on my
123:19 - local laptop so I'm gonna host the model
123:23 - and the what I'm this is the model name
123:28 - generate batch I'm gonna press host
123:31 - model I am going to activate it is
123:37 - active and then now once again I have
123:40 - got to I want to I'm going to look at
123:43 - the code is I need to get I need to
123:45 - basically change everything that I'm
123:48 - doing stays the same the only difference
123:51 - is here instead of local host I'm going
124:01 - to put the deployed model what is going
124:12 - on here oh yeah model URL so I'm going
124:16 - to here we go I've got the model URL and
124:21 - then this would work except I need to
124:25 - authenticate and once again I'm going to
124:28 - manage to do we're gonna have to not
124:29 - show you my key so the only thing that
124:32 - changes here is I need an authorization
124:34 - token so I'm gonna grab that
124:37 - authorization token looks very quickly
124:43 - and so there's the token
124:49 - so let me just grab the what I need now
124:53 - which is the authorization token I think
124:55 - that's the only thing I need to add
125:07 - so basically coming back to what I'm
125:11 - showing you all I did was add an
125:13 - authorization line an authorization line
125:22 - which now will get the runway token from
125:25 - the dot env file but I have not put the
125:29 - runway token in the dot env file so let
125:31 - me do that dot env I want to call that
125:36 - what did I call it runway token and I've
125:42 - got to get that token putting that in
125:50 - the dot int so it's in the dot env file
125:53 - ooh weird okay actually I need to change
125:57 - it's gonna be all right oh I'm just
126:00 - gonna change something here so the
126:01 - runway token is in there but I also need
126:05 - to change something very quickly about
126:07 - the code which is this so I need to
126:14 - actually and before the token comes it
126:17 - needs to say bearer and then this is a
126:22 - variable and then end the string so this
126:27 - should work now with the deployed model
126:31 - let me make sure I can close this so
126:34 - this model is deployed at that URL I can
126:37 - confirm that if I go back to my if I go
126:44 - back to runway this model is currently
126:46 - not running in fact let me just throw
126:49 - caution to the wind and I'm gonna quit
126:51 - the runway app completely so I've quit
126:53 - the runway app completely and I should
126:56 - be now going to this hosted model
127:01 - and I believe by the way I misquote I
127:02 - think the price is actually one cent per
127:06 - query so it will be costing me a dollar
127:10 - for every hundred dad jokes so I don't
127:12 - know how long I'll actually run this but
127:15 - and I do have a lot of credits with
127:18 - runway that they've given me for free
127:19 - which I'm very thankful for but let me
127:22 - run this so now I'm running this again
127:24 - and I'm going to go back to I'm gonna go
127:34 - back to here so let's just see is it
127:36 - working or are you guys ahead of me test
127:39 - one two three oh oh I don't like that
127:44 - okay let me go back in valid JSON
127:53 - unexpected token or okay hold on I must
127:59 - have missed something let me go back and
128:01 - look I the problem is when I go look at
128:03 - the reference for what what code I need
128:06 - I've got to run run away again so what
128:09 - did I miss
128:10 - on that token is sitting there so I
128:12 - don't want you to see it so let me go to
128:18 - where the model is hosted hosted models
128:22 - it's active requests errors code so I
128:30 - can't show you the JavaScript because
128:32 - it's got the token in it but I'm looking
128:37 - at it oh no hmm I might have I think I
128:43 - see a possible thing that I messed up no
128:45 - oh yes I found it
128:47 - awesome so this is what I messed up I
128:50 - need to go to the query route so that
128:53 - should be query there that's the thing
128:55 - that I missed so you just double check
128:58 - that yeah okay so the quit runway again
129:02 - so that should hopefully have fixed it
129:06 - and I'm gonna rerun the bot ooh
129:11 - what yikes
129:13 - what did I mess up I D of not wait what
129:19 - what the did nobody test the bots for a
129:23 - minute okay ready and let's see oh
129:38 - that's so sad
129:39 - you can't see that it's still not
129:41 - working uh did I get an error whoops I
129:50 - think I want to take out all this
129:52 - console logging because it's do it I got
129:56 - to take out the console logging because
129:58 - I can't follow what's going on
130:00 - so we're because it's where is that
130:04 - console log here it is let's take that
130:06 - out let's go into joke KS and see make
130:17 - sure I'm getting the prompt it's console
130:21 - log the prompt just to make sure that's
130:24 - coming in and then para runway token
130:32 - this looks right oh no no no no no wait
130:36 - what's going on here no that's fine
130:39 - yeah this is fine I mean I'm just using
130:42 - single quotes and double quotes like a
130:44 - total crazy person oops
130:51 - but let me run the bot again and let's
131:00 - see what we got here let's see what
131:06 - error message we get joke what why is my
131:11 - code broken oh it gave me something back
131:20 - that's promising
131:23 - is it working and I just didn't get like
131:27 - a good result here joke why did the
131:34 - chicken cross the road oh it works okay
131:41 - everybody have at it
131:43 - and let's see let's see what kind of
131:47 - jokes we get
132:01 - then nobody post anymore what did the
132:06 - kitten say - what did the kitten say to
132:09 - the other kitten yeah I don't know how
132:14 - many programmers does it take to Khoda
132:16 - by yes but what if they change their
132:18 - minds we're getting a bunch of jokes
132:27 - coming in what do you call a dog that
132:38 - could do magic Harry I'm not talking
132:40 - magic because it knows about Harry
132:43 - Potter somehow I actually have a huge
132:46 - Harry Potter fan on why I press the boo
132:48 - is it oh it's 1:10 a.m. I'm gonna this
132:52 - is definitely the end we'll come back to
132:54 - the hue lights next week which is not a
132:55 - good thing for the morning show because
132:57 - it's gonna be so bright in here because
132:58 - the Sun will be in here but three people
133:01 - walk into a bar the bartender says two
133:04 - beers please one from one for the road
133:08 - [Applause]
133:11 - what can Internet Explorer do short URL
133:26 - I love waiting for these why is
133:39 - processing the best yes but don't change
133:42 - the color of the light bulb two
133:44 - programmers walk into a coding cafe they
133:47 - ask the waiter for a small donation
133:48 - towards their high school diploma
133:50 - the waiter says thank you sir an
133:52 - infinite number of mathematicians walk
133:55 - into a bar why couldn't the bike stand
134:01 - up by itself a tyre jamming the pavement
134:18 - alright everybody I'm gonna let this I'm
134:22 - gonna let this run for a little bit
134:24 - let's see can I I want to like get the
134:29 - full thing on screen here oh wait hold
134:35 - on
134:37 - whoops no okay okay
135:00 - okay think now alright everybody thank
135:09 - you so much for tuning in this is this
135:12 - the reach the end of this episode three
135:15 - of late night coding train where we're
135:17 - making weird AI fun projects I'm gonna
135:20 - let this bot run overnight against my
135:22 - better judgment I'm gonna hang out in
135:25 - this channel for a little bit after I
135:28 - shut all this stuff down but and I'm
135:31 - gonna leave this up so people can watch
135:33 - the discord and the different jokes come
135:36 - up for a little bit while I say goodbye
135:39 - so thanks again for watching and being
135:44 - here and I will see you next week I mean
135:47 - my tentative plan is Monday Tuesday
135:50 - Wednesday 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time
135:52 - unfortunately the morning show really
135:54 - will be limited to an hour because at 8
135:56 - o'clock I have to go and wake up the
135:59 - children oh boy unfortunately I this is
136:02 - why we can't have nice things but thank
136:04 - you I'm gonna have to go and look
136:07 - through I might retrain the model and
136:10 - make sure that the language in there is
136:12 - all family-friendly okay
136:15 - so right now I think I'm gonna leave
136:21 - well I guess we could open up the
136:23 - permissions to after the stream shuts
136:27 - down we could change the permissions for
136:29 - everybody in the discord I don't want to
136:31 - broadcast and have the open permissions
136:34 - because you know I sort of I trust the
136:38 - supporter group and I all of you are
136:39 - wonderful people I'm sure who but you
136:41 - know every once in a while somebody
136:43 - likes to if they've got access to typing
136:46 - words onto a live stream try some
136:49 - shenanigans so thanks so much for
136:52 - watching and I will be letting this run
136:55 - for a little bit then I'll shut this off
136:57 - but I'll be in the discord for a little
136:59 - bit I mean I really should just need to
137:00 - go to sleep but I really retake you
137:03 - going with me of this experiment I hope
137:05 - this was fun for you feedback and
137:06 - thoughts is what are welcome
137:10 - and I'll see you I guess stay tuned the
137:13 - discord I'll announce there if I'm gonna
137:15 - be doing this late-night thing again
137:17 - next week or the morning thing next week
137:18 - or none of it at all next week so we'll
137:23 - see I love this new joke how did the AI
137:25 - cross the road yeah it was a good angle
137:27 - for me I don't have my laughs up all
137:34 - right so see you all soon
137:41 - [Music]
