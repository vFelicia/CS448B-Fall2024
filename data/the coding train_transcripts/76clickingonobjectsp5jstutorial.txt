00:01 - hi so uh I've been working with this
00:03 - same exact example in a bunch of videos
00:05 - now the previous one all I did was take
00:07 - the code for the bubble Constructor
00:09 - function and move it to a separate tab
00:11 - so we can now look at it on its own and
00:13 - so what I want to do in this video is
00:16 - figure out how do I like essentially uh
00:21 - uh uh uh uh handle what to do if I click
00:24 - on each one of those circles now you
00:26 - have this concept right of events in
00:30 - programming and in particular in
00:31 - JavaScript programming event is this
00:33 - like fundamental idea and boy am I going
00:36 - to make a several more videos about
00:38 - events in particular when I start
00:40 - looking at uh other elements to the page
00:43 - that you might add besides the canvas a
00:45 - button a piece of text uh so this is
00:47 - kind of like foreshadowing stuff but
00:49 - right now all you really have on your
00:52 - page is a
00:55 - canvas like your can I'm you're drawing
00:58 - circles in the canvas but the only thing
01:01 - registering an event is that canvas and
01:04 - really the entire page the event that
01:06 - it's registering is a mous pressed event
01:10 - so if you write the function mous
01:13 - pressed whatever code you put in here
01:16 - will automatically be
01:18 - executed when you click the mouse and
01:21 - what you want so this event is something
01:23 - that fires for the whole page what you
01:25 - would like to do I think or what I would
01:26 - like to do in this particular video is
01:28 - attach this event essentially to each
01:31 - one of these circles so this circle does
01:33 - something only to itself when you click
01:35 - on it this circle does something only to
01:37 - itself when you click on it how do you
01:39 - do that so uh so first of all I should
01:41 - say this isn't just like magic or some
01:43 - automatic thing like in JavaScript
01:45 - whenever you say mouse press things just
01:47 - happen when you click the mouse no this
01:49 - is a part of P5 so in the same way that
01:51 - P5 looks for setup and looks for draw
01:54 - knowing where to start the code and
01:55 - knowing where to Loop the code P5 is
01:57 - always looking for Mouse pressed behind
01:59 - the scenes to know what code to execute
02:01 - when you click the mouse so you might
02:03 - have this instinct which is like oh in
02:05 - your object right I have this object
02:07 - over here I know I'll add another
02:10 - function to the object called this.
02:12 - Mouse pressed equals function and this
02:15 - is like a lovely idea I love that
02:17 - thinking of yours that I'm sure you had
02:19 - in your head uh it makes sort of sense
02:21 - like this is the function that gets
02:22 - triggered when you click the mouse on
02:24 - this object the issue is there's nobody
02:26 - knows what this object is or how big it
02:29 - is or what you want to do when you click
02:31 - on it or how you check if you click on
02:32 - it that's on you you made this object so
02:35 - this nothing inside the object can
02:37 - happen automatically it's up to you to
02:40 - trigger this function in the object
02:42 - yourself when you want to do so and the
02:44 - only way to do that is by triggering a
02:48 - function in the object in Mouse pressed
02:51 - itself so I'm going to write some code
02:53 - in here to kind of illustrate this a bit
02:55 - more so down here in draw you can see
02:58 - this is the code for doing something to
03:00 - every object I want to move every object
03:03 - and display every object for every
03:05 - bubble move and display it so in Mouse
03:08 - pressed what I want to do is something
03:10 - similar I also want to say do
03:15 - something to every single bubble when I
03:18 - click the mouse in the canvas do
03:20 - something to every single bubble what is
03:21 - it that I want to do check to see if the
03:23 - mouse is inside the bubble if the mouse
03:25 - is inside the bubble do something to the
03:27 - bubble that type of thing so the
03:29 - question is what do I type there well in
03:32 - this case I started with this idea of oh
03:36 - I'll call the function Mouse pressed in
03:38 - the object and while that does make a
03:41 - certain amount of sense I think it's a
03:42 - little bit tricky and dangerous to do
03:45 - that because Mouse pressed is this
03:47 - special P5 word right P5 setup is
03:50 - special draw is special Mouse pressed is
03:52 - special so while of course you could
03:54 - name it Mouse press inside the object I
03:56 - want to emphasize that this is now no
03:58 - longer part of P5 this is something that
04:00 - I'm adding to the object itself so I'm
04:02 - going to call this function uh clicked
04:06 - you know whatever you come up with a
04:07 - better name but so I'm writing a new
04:09 - again this is my name that I made up I
04:11 - could call that function porcupine if I
04:13 - like it just doesn't matter that doesn't
04:15 - really make any sense although I do you
04:16 - know porcupines are I think they're a
04:18 - nice animal they're very spiky and you
04:19 - might get hurt but you why should we be
04:22 - against porcupines I am for porcupines
04:25 - let that statement be known the point is
04:26 - though uh clicked sounds like oh I'm
04:28 - supposed to call it clicked it you're
04:30 - not supposed to but it makes sense for
04:31 - right now so this do clicked is a
04:33 - function so that function is a new
04:35 - function in the object so in the sketch
04:38 - code what do I want to do when I click
04:40 - the mouse on the page when I click the
04:42 - mouse on the page I want to call the
04:45 - click function for every bubble so I'm
04:47 - passing that event to the bubbles Mouse
04:49 - press is the event that the that P5 gets
04:51 - automatically that happens for you so
04:53 - this is now what I'm going to do is take
04:55 - that event and Trigger something in all
04:57 - the objects so here I go bubbles indexi
05:00 - doclick
05:03 - now let's think about what should I do
05:06 - in that object so one thing that I could
05:08 - do kind of quickly like I need to add
05:10 - some code here one thing I could do kind
05:12 - of quickly is just change the color of
05:13 - the object so uh so here's a question
05:16 - for you if the color changes what do I
05:19 - need to change the color well as you see
05:21 - here in Phil um the the the color is
05:24 - hardcoded it's always white with a
05:26 - little bit of alpha so if that color
05:28 - should change I need a variable and that
05:30 - color has to be variable it has to
05:31 - change so I'm going to add to the object
05:33 - another variable I'm going to call it C
05:35 - for color and it can start as that white
05:40 - color and I'll say fill color call
05:44 - instead of color color is again another
05:45 - key word part of P5 oh oh oh I made the
05:49 - classic error right I cannot help but
05:51 - make this error constantly over and over
05:53 - again this do color this. call is the
05:57 - variable part of this object this bubble
05:59 - object so what do I need to say there
06:02 - this. so if you get that error a
06:04 - variable is not defined inside an object
06:07 - it's probably because you forgot the
06:08 - this dot so I'm going to say this Dot
06:11 - and now I can see look there we go I
06:14 - have my white circles when they're
06:16 - clicked then the color should change
06:19 - what should it change to I don't know I
06:21 - like purple purple's my favorite color I
06:25 - think this is going to be
06:27 - purple uh so I'm going to make them
06:29 - purple so now right what happens what
06:32 - happened the sketch is running all the
06:34 - circles are being drawn with this
06:35 - particular white color when I click the
06:38 - mouse this code is triggered call that
06:41 - click function on all of the bubbles and
06:43 - all the bubbles their color will now be
06:45 - set to
06:46 - purple there we go ah it's more pink
06:49 - whatever it looks kind of purple on this
06:50 - screen I got lots of screens all over
06:51 - the place and like surrounded by screens
06:55 - it's a little weird but okay so uh I'm
06:57 - get I'm getting off the topic here so uh
07:00 - I kind of got somewhere right I did pass
07:02 - an event like anywhere I you know I
07:04 - could run this again and again anywhere
07:06 - I click you know all of those all of
07:09 - them are going to turn purple that's not
07:11 - what I want I want only the one that I
07:14 - click on to change color how do I do
07:16 - that well first of all why is this
07:17 - happening I've done no checking to see
07:20 - where the mouse is relative to those
07:22 - objects right all I did was call the
07:24 - function clicked on all of them and
07:26 - immediately set all of them to that
07:27 - color so what I need to do is do some
07:30 - sort of checking so how do I know if
07:31 - you've clicked on something so let's
07:33 - come I think we need a diagram for
07:35 - this I think I've probably drawn this
07:38 - diagram in another video uh but might as
07:40 - well do it again since it's relevant
07:42 - right here this is a
07:45 - circle this is the center of the circle
07:47 - you can consider its location XY this is
07:50 - the radius of a circle that's the half
07:53 - of the
07:54 - diameter and let's say this is where I
07:57 - clicked the mouse right here so one the
08:00 - piece of information that I need is I
08:02 - need to know how far away from the
08:05 - center of the circle did I click the
08:07 - mouse this is mouse X Mouse
08:12 - Y how far from XY to Mouse X Mouse y
08:15 - what's that value what's that distance
08:17 - for D and um I really need a new marker
08:20 - which I'll get for the next video but um
08:22 - how do I compute that well I'll tell you
08:25 - you could use this thing called the
08:26 - Pythagorean theorem and you could
08:28 - subtract the X's from the Y and square
08:30 - some things and do the square root love
08:31 - to talk about that I love Pagan theorem
08:34 - is it's one of my my my
08:36 - top 10 I don't know five I'm not sure
08:39 - where it is in the top but um the uh I
08:41 - forgot what I was saying so the point of
08:43 - this here is that you could do all that
08:45 - but P5 has a nice function for you built
08:47 - in I just got to get that new pen now I
08:50 - I
08:51 - have never leave home without an entire
08:53 - box of whiteboard
08:55 - markers if you're me and you like to WR
08:58 - write on white okay oh so much better
09:00 - okay VAR D equals the distance between X
09:04 - comma y Mouse X Mouse y so you can use
09:10 - this function built into five P5 called
09:13 - distance which will give you the
09:14 - distance between those two points and
09:15 - guess what if that distance is greater
09:17 - than the radius you're outside the
09:19 - circle if that distance is less than the
09:21 - radius you're inside the circle so
09:23 - you've clicked on the circle if D is
09:26 - less than R so only if that distance is
09:28 - less than the radius is do I want to
09:30 - change the color so we can come back
09:31 - here and add that to this program right
09:34 - first I want to get that distance
09:37 - between Mouse X Mouse Y and what am I
09:40 - about to forget I'm about to say this.x
09:44 - thisy uh this dox this doy and I will
09:47 - give myself a little more space here uh
09:50 - and I want to say if the distance is
09:52 - less than the radius so what's the
09:53 - radius for these circles well you can
09:55 - see that I've drawing them at 48 48
09:59 - being its diameter its width its height
10:01 - so half of that would be
10:03 - 24 if distance is less than 24 then
10:07 - change the color so here we go and now I
10:11 - can click here look I'm clicking around
10:13 - here nothing's changing come over here
10:15 - click on this circle pink purple pink
10:18 - purple right there we go I'm moving the
10:20 - mouse very slowly and clicking I could
10:22 - do all these so each one of these is
10:24 - changing color now there's a couple
10:26 - improvements that I would suggest making
10:28 - to this but I will leave that for you if
10:29 - you're kind of following along and
10:31 - trying to do some exercises with this um
10:33 - one is that I would not leave this as 24
10:37 - and 48 I mean it makes sense at this
10:39 - point that you have a variable to
10:40 - describe the size of your circles so
10:43 - this do diameter this. radius whatever
10:45 - you want to call it or think about it I
10:47 - would add that to your code and use use
10:49 - the variable here and use the variable
10:51 - here other thing you might think about
10:52 - as a little bit of a tricky problem is
10:54 - right now they're all the exactly the
10:56 - same color so every time you click on it
10:58 - you could get a random color or each one
11:00 - could be a specific color or how about
11:03 - it changes its shape from a circle to a
11:05 - square you know what else it grows it
11:07 - shrinks what else could you do for when
11:09 - you click on it they don't move they
11:10 - stop moving when you click on it try to
11:12 - think of some other feature besides just
11:14 - changing the color and and try to add
11:16 - that so hopefully this gives you a sense
11:18 - of if you know all that P5 is giving you
11:21 - is the moment you click on the canvas
11:23 - and all that you know is that you
11:25 - clicked on the canvas and you know where
11:26 - you clicked on the canvas but those
11:28 - objects are your own so if you want to
11:30 - figure out if the objects were clicked
11:31 - on it's up to you to write your own code
11:34 - inside the object to make that
11:36 - determination now later when we use some
11:38 - other elements on the page like buttons
11:40 - or sliders or other kind of Dom elements
11:42 - what's Dom I don't know you know Dom is
11:43 - that a person my friend named Dom we're
11:46 - really not friends I mean I don't want
11:48 - to be mean or anything but the Dom no no
11:51 - Dom is he he she I don't know it
11:53 - whatever okay I'm I'm I'm losing my mind
11:55 - here so the point is there's going to be
11:57 - other ways you're going to see that we
11:58 - can attach events to specific items on
12:00 - the page which is a little bit different
12:02 - to how we're kind of in our code
12:04 - attaching events to these things in the
12:05 - canvas okay I was really forcing the
12:07 - jokes in this video I got to just let
12:09 - them flow more
12:10 - naturally not that these videos are
12:12 - supposed to have jokes that's
12:15 - like okay um goodbye I'm going to see
12:18 - you in the next this was 12 minutes long
12:19 - which is two minutes too long because I
12:20 - rambled about somebody named Dom which
12:22 - really doesn't make any sense okay talk
12:24 - to you later
