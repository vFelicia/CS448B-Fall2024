00:00 - It's a coding train express stop! And i'm 
going to show you how to do a pull request.  
00:04 - This is a repository on GitHub it is at 
CodingTrain/Express-Stops. If you want to propose  
00:11 - a change, make a pull request to the README file, 
I could click on this README file. (You've got to  
00:17 - be logged into GitHub with an account.) Click on 
this edit button (looks like a pencil) then add  
00:21 - your "I am making a short because I am young and 
hip" And then I'm going to type in the change that  
00:29 - i want to be in the world. I'm going to look 
at this "propose change" button right there.  
00:34 - Click "propose change" then that proposal of the 
change to that file will become a pull request!I  
00:41 - can write a little note like "be the change you 
want to be this is a YouTube short will anyone  
00:48 - watch it?" I'm going to now create this 
pull request by pressing this button  
00:52 - and someday my friend dan will eventually merge 
this and it will be in this repository forever!
