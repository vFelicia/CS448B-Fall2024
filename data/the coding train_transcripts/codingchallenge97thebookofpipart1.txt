00:00 - hello welcome to another Pi Day 2018
00:04 - themed coding challenge and in this
00:07 - coding challenge I'm gonna try to make
00:09 - something which I am calling the book of
00:11 - Pi now I really like kind of a strange
00:14 - person that you you've already well
00:16 - aware of this I really like books that
00:18 - are just full of numbers I'd like to
00:20 - read them quietly to my children at
00:22 - night time for bedtime 69 thousand one
00:26 - hundred and three fifty six thousand
00:27 - five hundred sixty these are some random
00:29 - numbers from the book of a million
00:31 - random digits now I would love to say
00:33 - more about this book I'll include a link
00:34 - to more information about this book in
00:36 - this video's description but what I
00:38 - would love to have in my hands is a book
00:40 - with a million digits of pi maybe ten
00:43 - million digits maybe a hundred million
00:45 - I don't know and many digits I could fit
00:47 - into a book so then from there perhaps
00:50 - even it would be you might think about
00:52 - making a giant poster that has every
00:54 - digit and then visualizing each digit as
00:56 - something like a color or a shape or
00:58 - creating your own piece of art from the
01:00 - digits of pi so I want this video to be
01:02 - a place a video that you could watch to
01:04 - get you started on this so what I'm
01:07 - gonna do to figure this out is I'm gonna
01:09 - first of all I'm in use processing which
01:11 - is a Java based programming environment
01:12 - from the processing foundation much more
01:14 - information about that below in the
01:15 - video description as well and I already
01:18 - have in the in this the data folder a
01:21 - text file with 1 million digits of pi I
01:24 - will include when I publish the code for
01:27 - this I will also include a link to ten
01:30 - million digits and 1 billion digits and
01:32 - you can find more as well so but I'm
01:35 - actually going to comment this out
01:37 - because what I want to do first is I
01:40 - just want to have a system by which I
01:43 - can render a grid because ultimately I'm
01:46 - going to have a grid of all the digits
01:47 - on each page and I want to render each
01:50 - digit individually right one thing I
01:52 - could do is just take that text file and
01:54 - do print so depite export to PDF but I
01:57 - want to be able to render all this stuff
01:58 - in an artistic way so I mean I'm not
02:01 - going to in an artistic way I want to
02:03 - show you how to do an artistic way so
02:05 - you the person watching with artistic
02:06 - talent can make something or just if you
02:09 - had some creative experimental idea
02:10 - don't feel any pressure to
02:11 - make anything quote unquote artistic
02:13 - artistic with a lowercase a alright so
02:15 - let's start by I'm gonna create a nested
02:19 - loop with Y on the outside and this is
02:23 - I'm gonna do this in a sort of weird way
02:25 - I'm gonna say W equals I'm gonna just
02:28 - arbitrarily pick some numbers and I'm
02:31 - gonna have a width and a height and have
02:33 - it both be 12 through the matter as I
02:37 - tried to do this earlier today and I
02:38 - kind of mucked it up so I'm sort of
02:42 - thought about it a bit more which
02:44 - doesn't mean that I'll anything will be
02:45 - close to correct but I now have a nested
02:48 - loop and what I want to do in this
02:50 - nested loop is I want to draw a
02:51 - rectangle at every x and y that is the
02:55 - size of width and height and I want to
02:57 - give it a random color so let's just
03:01 - start like this the reason why I want to
03:03 - do this I want to see okay I can draw a
03:05 - grid of random colors now what I want to
03:07 - do just to get started is let me
03:10 - represent each digit of pi with a
03:13 - grayscale value so zero only black be
03:15 - black nine will be white and every other
03:17 - digit will be some color in between so
03:20 - how can I do that now what I can do is I
03:22 - can load my digits of pi file I this
03:26 - this is actually in there because the
03:27 - the file doesn't have it just starts
03:29 - with one four one five nine actually
03:31 - don't want to include the three point
03:33 - but maybe if I make it a text version of
03:35 - it I will want that later so let me take
03:37 - that out so what I'm gonna do is I'm
03:39 - gonna create a variable called index and
03:41 - all the way through the loop I'm gonna
03:44 - separately increment that index and I am
03:47 - going to get a string digit equals PI
03:54 - car at index and maybe I want to turn
03:57 - that into a number right now so why is
04:02 - this oh it would want to be a character
04:04 - mm-hmm let's will that know oh boy oh
04:07 - boy
04:08 - ah let's convert that to a string this
04:11 - is the awkward
04:12 - who's awkward I don't know what I'm
04:13 - doing then there's somebody in the chat
04:15 - that still could tell me a better way
04:16 - but let's call this s and then I say int
04:19 - digit equals and I'll just convert that
04:20 - quickly from a string to a digit so I
04:23 - could have made it
04:24 - anyway so let's let's start with that
04:26 - and then what I'm going to do is I'm
04:27 - going to create a color I'll call it
04:30 - bright for brightness which I'm going to
04:32 - map that digit which goes from 0 to 10
04:35 - to between 0 and 255
04:39 - um so 9 should really be so I think what
04:43 - I'm gonna do just I'm gonna make this
04:46 - 256 and make this 9 no no 255 sorry 0
04:52 - through 9 will that work
04:53 - I'm so confused already and this should
04:56 - be a float and actually yeah alright so
05:04 - let's let's do this ok here we go let's
05:06 - see what happens these are I think the
05:10 - digits of pi mapped to a grayscale value
05:13 - so the 9 are we seeing 9s are we seeing
05:15 - white the color white this could be a 9
05:17 - so what I would actually like to do now
05:19 - is write the digit in there so I could
05:22 - kind of debug this and see if it's
05:23 - working correctly so what I also then
05:26 - want to do is say text the digit oh I
05:31 - have a random in there oh the random
05:33 - thank you thank you to the chat this
05:36 - random should not be in there I thought
05:39 - that looked a little weird there we go
05:41 - so this looks better now 3.1415926
05:51 - this seems right so so maybe I won't
05:54 - write the numbers right let's write the
05:55 - numbers in there just to be sure because
05:57 - I want to be able to write the numbers
05:59 - eventually so I'm also gonna say text
06:02 - the digit I mean I could use the digit
06:06 - at that X&Y and I'm gonna say fill 255
06:10 - minus bright I'm just gonna invert the
06:12 - color and let's just see what happens
06:14 - there you can sort of see there are some
06:16 - numbers but they don't match up right so
06:18 - one issue is that when I draw a digit at
06:22 - this location right that top left it's
06:24 - actually appearing above so this is the
06:27 - wrong digit I want the digit to appear
06:29 - at the bottom so it should be y + H and
06:32 - I also want to say text-align:center
06:38 - which should give me okay that didn't
06:40 - work right
06:41 - because o because so I'm going to say
06:45 - this I could probably I'm gonna say X
06:46 - plus W divided by two
06:49 - let's do that let's run this again does
06:54 - that I missed it
06:55 - okay see you again now now this looks
06:57 - right right one four one five nine two
07:01 - six five so we can see that it is
07:03 - mapping to the correct colors wonderful
07:06 - okay we're getting somewhere now these
07:09 - don't really look like squares to me
07:11 - weirdly did I say width and height width
07:13 - height height width 12 twelve I don't
07:18 - know maybe that's an optical illusion
07:21 - and I'm being told in the chat that I
07:24 - should try Center Center can ivory
07:28 - a-line Center as well
07:30 - yep and then I could say height y plus
07:34 - height divided by two and now the digits
07:38 - are perfectly in theory perfectly
07:40 - aligned in the center of these what I
07:42 - believe to be squares you know what it
07:44 - is it's an optical illusion the fact
07:46 - that the characters are kind of
07:48 - elongated I think is tricking me into
07:50 - thinking those are taller than they are
07:52 - Y okay so now we see that so here's the
07:55 - thing I want to turn this into a book or
08:01 - I at the very least want to render a
08:03 - huge version of it so the way that I
08:07 - want to do this is with the PDF renderer
08:10 - in processing so I'm gonna go to the web
08:12 - and I'm gonna go to processing website
08:15 - reference actually libraries PDF export
08:20 - so one of the things processing has this
08:23 - size function where you typically will
08:25 - set the width and height of the window
08:27 - you can also set the renderer a renderer
08:30 - might be P 3d for 3d graphics but a
08:32 - renderer can also be PDF and when it
08:34 - renders to PDF it's not rendering the
08:37 - pixels of what you seeing it's actually
08:39 - drawing the vector based lines and
08:41 - shapes of what you're drawing so that
08:43 - this is now something you could blow up
08:45 - to be super high resolution or important
08:47 - to some other kind of program that works
08:49 - natively with vector
08:50 - so so but actually instead I want to be
08:54 - able to still see what I'm doing on the
08:55 - screen so I'm going to go and get the
08:59 - look at this example with a screen
09:02 - display and I can actually just use size
09:03 - as normal but call begin record so I'm
09:07 - gonna say oops ah actually I don't
09:09 - okay I don't need to copy/paste this I'm
09:10 - gonna say right here begin record book
09:15 - of Pi dot PDF I think that's all I have
09:19 - to say no oh PDF write PDF yes because
09:26 - begin record could also I think render
09:28 - out like a 3d model
09:29 - I'm thinking it's another version of and
09:31 - then I at the end I want to say and
09:33 - record so let's run this again oops oh I
09:40 - forgot I have to import the library
09:42 - so for to do it I have to import
09:44 - processing dot PDF dot star this is Java
09:46 - syntax for importing a separate Java
09:49 - library so we see this here and now if I
09:52 - go to the sketch folder there's a PDF
09:54 - called book of Pi and I can blow that up
09:58 - and run around look at that so you can
10:00 - see here so even though it's zooming in
10:02 - I want to zoom in this way so you can
10:03 - really see right no matter how far i
10:06 - zoom in I don't lose any quality because
10:09 - this is actually drawing the vector path
10:11 - to this PDF now one thing we should look
10:13 - at is the size of the PDF this isn't so
10:15 - bad 163 kilobytes we're in good shape
10:18 - here one thing that I think that I want
10:20 - to do is let's change the well actually
10:24 - let me take out drawing the text I'm
10:26 - gonna cook I'll come back to that now I
10:30 - just want to see how big can I make this
10:33 - so if I make this so what would be now
10:37 - let's say I want to fit all million
10:39 - digits into one page so let me keep it
10:42 - at 400 400 mmm let me think about this
10:44 - let me actually make this 800 by 800
10:46 - just to start with something larger a
10:48 - million the square root of 1 million is
10:51 - what 1 thousands so if I want to have a
10:55 - thousand columns and a thousand rows
10:58 - let's start with something smaller let's
11:01 - start with a hundred columns and a
11:02 - hundred
11:03 - rose then the width should be the width
11:09 - divided by the number of columns the
11:11 - height should be the height divided by
11:14 - the number of rows right so this should
11:19 - be a thought and then if I do print line
11:21 - I'm just curious index this should have
11:24 - gotten to 10,000 right this should show
11:26 - 10,000 rectangles there you go so that's
11:29 - 10,000 rectangles and that is now also
11:33 - in this PDF which is still right there
11:38 - so I can zoom all the way in and we can
11:39 - see I can zoom all the way out can I do
11:42 - view
11:44 - I just wanted to zoom to fit I guess
11:47 - it's already done that okay so we can
11:49 - see there it is all right now let's see
11:50 - if we can get all 1 million digits of pi
11:57 - so let's change this to one thousand one
12:02 - thousand in theory I shouldn't worry
12:03 - about the size of the window it's sort
12:05 - of irrelevant at this point although
12:06 - there's an issue with the numbers
12:07 - getting so so small that that might make
12:10 - the PDF rendering kind of wonky let's
12:13 - see what happens so this is gonna take a
12:15 - long time hold on take a break go get a
12:18 - cup of tea I'll be back I'm back I
12:22 - didn't work actually got an error
12:24 - straight index out of range 1 million so
12:27 - the index should never have gone to 1
12:29 - million but I think I probably have a
12:32 - little bit of a rounding error so I'm
12:35 - just gonna write now I'm just gonna like
12:37 - not worry too much about that and say if
12:39 - index index is greater than s dot length
12:45 - then greater than or equal to X dot
12:51 - length index should equal s dot length
12:55 - minus 1 so this will at least get rid of
12:57 - that error but I just realized something
12:58 - if this is 800 by 800 and I'm playing to
13:01 - have a thousand by a thousand that's
13:03 - definitely not going to work I don't
13:05 - even have that many pixels so I possibly
13:07 - draw that many rectangles this is why I
13:09 - might not want to bother to render the
13:11 - preview the preview is going to be
13:13 - irrelevant but I'm sort of wondering
13:15 - if it kind of will make do once it goes
13:16 - to the PDF because this the actual pixel
13:19 - dimensions are irrelevant so I'm just
13:21 - curious I'm gonna let it go again and
13:23 - see what it does it shouldn't look like
13:26 - anything in the window but maybe we'll
13:28 - see something so so this is the PDF I
13:33 - got that didn't seem to work
13:34 - it's all in there though because it is
13:36 - 13 megabytes oh well maybe it's just
13:39 - really slow to appear let's try let's
13:42 - try creating a larger window size even
13:45 - if it's larger than what I can see on
13:46 - the screen so what I want to do is
13:48 - actually I'm gonna say no stroke ooh
13:53 - this was for the text I'm gonna say no
13:56 - stroke to get rid of the outline of the
13:58 - rectangle and then also I am going to
14:02 - make this the size of 4,000 by 4,000
14:06 - which should at least give me a 4 by 4
14:08 - or 2 by 2 rectangle let's see if that
14:11 - what that does so it's much bigger than
14:16 - what I can display on my screen hmm that
14:21 - doesn't look right
14:22 - either this is the penis something in
14:23 - that PDF for sure let me go back and
14:26 - look here did I make some weird mistake
14:30 - oh yeah I have a new idea one is I'm
14:34 - gonna get rid of the PDF rendering and
14:37 - what I'm actually going to do is I am
14:42 - going to use create graphics so I'm
14:44 - going to create an off-screen graphics
14:46 - context that's much bigger than the
14:48 - window and I'm gonna say P graphics and
14:53 - I'm gonna call this a canvas and I'm
14:56 - gonna say canvas equals create graphics
15:02 - that's I'm gonna make this quite big
15:05 - 16,000 by 16,000 gonna make a huge
15:09 - graphics window
15:10 - I think processing should be able to do
15:13 - that and then I'm just gonna have the
15:15 - actual size of the window be 800 by 800
15:17 - and I still wanna have columns and rows
15:19 - and now I want to say everything should
15:21 - be done as part of the canvas so instead
15:25 - of rendering to the window
15:29 - and though so now I want to say canvas
15:32 - taught Phil Camus taught stroke lamda
15:33 - stat rectangle and then I am going to oh
15:40 - oh I just noticed something I just
15:44 - noticed something that I forgot about
15:46 - this is integer arithmetic so that's
15:49 - gonna really mess stuff up especially
15:52 - when I had only 800 pixels that's why I
15:55 - didn't see anything so let me make these
15:57 - just to let me make these floats because
16:01 - an integer divided by an integer will
16:03 - always be an integer oh no these were
16:05 - floats though nevermind
16:07 - since column and rows were floats I'm
16:09 - wrong about that that actually doesn't
16:10 - matter here okay but there's weird that
16:13 - it's printing out the index still a zero
16:15 - oh because because when it gets to the
16:17 - end it shouldn't be zero but let's keep
16:19 - going with this canvas fill no stroke
16:22 - rectangle so now I need to say instead
16:24 - of begin record I must say canvas
16:27 - stopped again draw and at the end
16:32 - so this off-screen canvas I could say
16:35 - end draw you can draw to it just like
16:37 - the window and then I can actually just
16:40 - draw the window right there draw the
16:42 - canvas right into the window so let's
16:44 - not go crazy let's make the off-screen
16:46 - canvas 800 by 800 and let's just have 40
16:50 - rows and 40 columns okay there's some
16:53 - other weird mistake in my code s dot
16:56 - length two pi dot length oh look at this
17:02 - what a disaster I wasn't looking at pi
17:06 - anymore
17:09 - this whole time this whole time this
17:13 - whole time well there we go
17:21 - it's working now so let me just keep
17:24 - going with this method and I'll come
17:26 - back to the PDF this was good to look at
17:28 - anyway so now let me make the size
17:30 - actually 8000 by 8000 let me just do 200
17:37 - by 200 what whoops no the size should be
17:39 - 800 and let me have this be 8,000 by
17:43 - 8,000 and let's see what happens here
17:45 - whoa something went wrong
17:48 - canvas dot with canvas dot height rows
17:53 - columns canvas dot oh I need to say I
17:58 - need to shrink it down now if they're
18:00 - not the same size so this is the giant
18:03 - thing now but if I were to say canvas
18:07 - dot save you know PI Post this is the
18:10 - poster of Pi and I say PNG poster of Pi
18:17 - dot PNG that's not right oh semicolon
18:20 - I'm gonna run this come on you can do it
18:26 - you can save it there we go all right so
18:31 - now rendered it I see my preview here
18:34 - and if I go here we have PI poster which
18:37 - is a two megabyte file I can take a look
18:40 - at that and we can see this is what it
18:42 - actually is zoomed in so now can I fit
18:47 - all 1 million digits let's make that
18:51 - happen
18:52 - so now I'm gonna have a thousand by a
18:55 - thousand I'm gonna make it
18:57 - sixteen thousand by sixteen thousand so
19:00 - each each rectangle will be sixteen
19:03 - pixels by 16 pixels I think that's about
19:05 - right who knows who knows my math is off
19:07 - this is gonna take a while to render
19:09 - let's hit save
19:11 - go go make yourself a cup of tea and
19:13 - I'll be back when it renders or what it
19:17 - says right here out of memory okay wait
19:24 - and we've already got the out of memory
19:26 - error so one thing is I could go back to
19:28 - my nice PDF world which I wouldn't have
19:30 - this issue necessarily and but I can
19:34 - actually do better than that let's take
19:35 - a look at the processing preferences and
19:37 - go to here oh I've already given it four
19:45 - gigabytes of memory so I've already done
19:47 - this all right let's try making this
19:50 - smaller let's do let's do let's try 4000
19:56 - by 4000 that should be fine alright see
20:02 - you in a bit oh there it is
20:09 - so 4,000 by 4,000 you can see here this
20:11 - is all that it's all one million digits
20:14 - of pi all in one window and if I go now
20:20 - to here post or PI a 1.2 megabyte file I
20:24 - open it up and look at this this is it
20:28 - this is it everybody this is now a a
20:36 - 4,000 by 4,000 RGB image with all the
20:39 - digits of pi okay we're getting
20:40 - somewhere
20:41 - we definitely should use HSB mode
20:44 - that'll be much more fun let's push it
20:46 - let's push it a little let's make it
20:51 - 8,000 by 8,000 to see if we can make
20:52 - that happen and let's change this to
20:55 - let's say I think I have to say canvas
20:58 - color mode canvas color mode HSB and
21:06 - let's just say 1.0 let's have everything
21:09 - beef between 0 and 1 and so now I should
21:13 - be able to say map
21:17 - this would be now be the hue and I
21:21 - should be able say hue 1 1 and this
21:23 - should go between 0 and 1 and actually
21:24 - be much easier just to say digit divided
21:27 - by 10
21:28 - by 9:00 right because I want to get to
21:30 - one point oh I think yeah all right so
21:33 - let's see what happens here that's what
21:40 - I got that doesn't look right
21:42 - okay this was the problem spent a lot of
21:45 - time debugging that you could check the
21:47 - live stream if you want to see it a
21:49 - little 10 minutes of me searching for
21:50 - this but I called color mode before I
21:53 - said big begin draw which is really a
21:56 - problem that's a very bad thing that's
21:58 - not gonna work so I need color mode to
22:00 - happen after and in this case now I can
22:03 - I can set the hue I could set the hue I
22:08 - could I could I mean I should be able to
22:10 - now put it back to 1:1 if I want to use
22:13 - color mode HSV with a range of 1 from 0
22:16 - to 1 and I should see there we go so now
22:18 - I see these are some digits of pi with a
22:21 - different hue saturation and brightness
22:23 - and maybe just for our eyes let's make
22:30 - the this seems kind of maybe do I want
22:35 - the brightness higher but they give the
22:37 - saturation I don't know what I'm doing
22:40 - oh I think I just want it not as bright
22:41 - but I want it like I want it fully
22:43 - saturated yeah whatever you can this is
22:47 - the problem I'm this is the problem I
22:50 - have a problem what my kids you just say
22:56 - so the problem is I'm terrible at design
22:59 - so but we're good it's where it's
23:01 - functional and you are better at making
23:03 - something beautiful than I am okay so
23:05 - let me go back now and say 1000 columns
23:11 - 1000 rows eight thousand pixels eight
23:15 - thousand pixels and here we go
23:24 - I'm going I'm running it again with full
23:26 - brightness and saturation just to like
23:29 - leave it in this or a default state here
23:31 - we go oh and I want this to be nine all
23:33 - right here we go ready
23:34 - oh you back in a minute once it renders
23:38 - tada
23:40 - there it is 1 million digits of pi all
23:43 - mapped to a to a different hue and let's
23:46 - actually open up the let's take a look
23:48 - at the PDF I'm it's not a PDF sorry the
23:50 - PNG which is just a 2.6 megabyte file
23:52 - and I can zoom in on it and we can sort
23:58 - of scroll around and see these are all
23:59 - the digits of pi mapped to a given hue
24:04 - so now we're getting somewhere now
24:05 - here's the thing I wouldn't go back to
24:08 - PDF land let me see if I could render
24:11 - this to a PDF okay because I think the
24:14 - issues I was having before didn't have
24:16 - to do with the PDF rendering they had to
24:18 - do with my own other kinds of mistakes
24:20 - so what do I need to do I'm gonna change
24:23 - this from I'm gonna say let me think
24:30 - about let me think okay everybody stay
24:35 - calm I think what I would like to do is
24:38 - do the PDF rendering without seeing a
24:42 - preview because I think I could sort of
24:45 - double up the code and draw everything
24:47 - to canvas and the PDF but I think what I
24:50 - want to do is actually if I go back to
24:52 - the processing reference I want to do
24:54 - this single frame no no display okay
24:59 - because I'm just gonna trust in my code
25:03 - so I'm gonna get rid of I'm gonna what
25:06 - I'm actually gonna do is I'm going I'm
25:07 - gonna save a new version of this so
25:09 - that's like a version that renders a PNG
25:11 - file I'm going to say PI day five I got
25:13 - to rename all these and so I I can muck
25:16 - around with this a little bit more I'm
25:17 - gonna take out the canvas I'm gonna take
25:19 - out the canvas I am going to again I'm
25:24 - gonna put this back to a hundred and a
25:25 - hundred I'm gonna say I'm gonna say a
25:28 - PDF book of Pi up dot PDF
25:36 - I am going to say columns and rows
25:39 - that's good load the you load the data
25:41 - up here then I don't need to begin
25:44 - record anymore if I'm so this is gone
25:47 - and now all of my canvas dots should be
25:51 - gone again because I should be saying
25:53 - just color mode with height height with
25:56 - all this bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
25:58 - bla bla bla bla bla this is some
26:00 - ridiculousness there that I don't need I
26:02 - don't need to draw it anymore I don't
26:04 - need to save it anymore what I just need
26:06 - to do is say exit so when I use the PDF
26:10 - renderer here it will automatically
26:12 - render everything to this PDF and then
26:16 - exit the program so this shouldn't take
26:18 - very long to run let me just run it and
26:22 - I don't see anything because now I have
26:24 - to go and look at this PDF which nicely
26:26 - there's only 114 kilobytes I can open it
26:29 - up and there it is
26:31 - why is it not a square it is a square I
26:34 - just I just don't know how to use the
26:37 - computer I wanted to zoom to fit I don't
26:40 - know why it's not doing that let me just
26:42 - do this yeah okay so there you go there
26:43 - it is it's a PDF then we just can see
26:45 - that this is a vector drawing because no
26:47 - matter how far i zoom in as much as
26:49 - it'll let me I still have sort of a nice
26:51 - quality there alright now let's get a
26:54 - little more ambitious let's have it be
26:56 - 500 by 500 and let's make the size a
27:00 - thousand by a thousand and really the
27:02 - size is sort of irrelevant at this point
27:04 - so we'd finished there it is this is now
27:11 - a poster PDF and I can zoom all the way
27:16 - into with all the digits of pi and now
27:22 - is it gonna be okay I think it'll be
27:25 - okay why not why not 9 and 0 or both red
27:29 - that is a good point because I'm using
27:32 - hue saturation brightness hue is an ant
27:35 - is think of it as an angle on the color
27:37 - wheel
27:37 - 0 to 360 and 1.0 and zero would be the
27:42 - same so this should be divided by 10
27:44 - thank you for that excellent point me I
27:46 - am swimming in the chat let's run this
27:48 - again
27:50 - it hasn't stopped yet I should put
27:52 - something like print line finished it
27:58 - finished though because I can see that
27:59 - the play button became disabled so let's
28:02 - look at this one more time
28:04 - it's an 11.5 megabyte file now and I'm
28:08 - going to open it up and there it is
28:16 - 1 million digits of pi all with a
28:20 - different hue arbitrarily on a grid do
28:24 - you see the secret encoded magical
28:26 - messages there these are such small no
28:29 - it's it's just it's just having a lot of
28:31 - trouble rendering it but you can see
28:33 - it's slowly coming into focus all right
28:34 - now I want to do something really
28:37 - exciting because guess what I want to do
28:42 - this oh I already did all 1 million so
28:47 - what I want to do now I could do 10
28:48 - million I'm gonna open up no no no
28:51 - let me not be so ambitious let me make
28:54 - it a hundred by a hundred so if it is
28:56 - one oh that's a thousand pages so let's
29:00 - say I want to have it one thousand a
29:03 - hundred thousand per page to have it
29:06 - what's the square root of a hundred
29:07 - thousand I can get ten thousand per page
29:09 - that's what I'm doing here ten thousand
29:11 - per page that won't be that many pages
29:14 - let's do it yeah let me just easy math I
29:18 - don't care if it's a lot of pages 100 by
29:21 - 100 let's see what this looks like so we
29:25 - can see this is now 100 by 100 so that's
29:31 - one thousand ten thousand ten thousand
29:39 - that's ten thousand digits of pi
29:41 - represented as a hue okay now who okay
29:46 - this is very exciting what I'm gonna do
29:48 - now is I'm gonna say for int I equals
29:51 - zero I is less than ten so this is total
29:54 - pages I'm gonna say page equals zero no
29:58 - no let's just use I I is less than total
30:00 - pages I plus plus so
30:03 - pages equals PI dot length divided by
30:13 - columns times rows print line total
30:18 - pages right this is if I only have it
30:21 - 100 by 100 but I have 1 million digits
30:25 - than I need and 110 thousand this is how
30:28 - many pages I need now I can say this
30:31 - many total pages in debt and then I can
30:37 - I'm gonna say print line page I complete
30:47 - has one page I complete and put another
30:51 - bracket here and then I'm going to say
30:53 - ah so now if I go back to here what I
30:56 - for multiple pages I need access to the
30:59 - PDF renderer itself which I can grab
31:03 - right here after setup and then I can
31:08 - say PDF dot next page so I'm now going
31:15 - to make a multi-page PDF with ten
31:19 - thousand digits on each page ready for
31:21 - this
31:23 - I'll be back when when it finishes or
31:26 - has an error I'm not sure which one oh
31:31 - that was kind of anticlimactic
31:34 - I could actually already see that I have
31:36 - an error here the variable total pages
31:38 - does not exist so I forgot to say int I
31:41 - want this to be an int okay let's try
31:44 - this again should never use the drum
31:49 - float does not match with int because
31:52 - these are columns and rows are floats
31:55 - that's insane what's wrong with you and
31:57 - then this needs to be a float
32:03 - okay this is a flood I'm gonna just just
32:06 - just take your time
32:08 - these could probably be into boy Java
32:11 - you are fun okay wait
32:13 - all right I'll be back it's gonna render
32:14 - oh wait it finished 98 99 according to
32:21 - this it finished I now have a it's still
32:23 - a 10 megabyte PDF if I go to view
32:27 - thumbnails look at this page 1 page 2
32:32 - page 3 page 4 page 5 page 6 page 7 all
32:37 - the digits of pi
32:41 - alright let's just see if processing can
32:45 - do ten million digits okay so I'm
32:48 - basically done what I would love to see
32:50 - is like I'm gonna obviously this code
32:52 - will be on github I want to make a
32:53 - version that just like actually has the
32:55 - raw digits in it what's the most kind of
32:57 - interesting or strange way we can
32:59 - represent it can you fit it all into a
33:00 - big poster can you make a book let's
33:02 - make a coding train book of Pi together
33:05 - as a community won't that would be fun
33:07 - but before I go let's just push let's
33:10 - push it a little
33:11 - thank you Andres Calibri creator of the
33:13 - OpenGL processing library we always like
33:16 - to say that ok so now what I want to do
33:20 - is I'm gonna change this I have a 10 but
33:23 - I don't have the 10 million file so let
33:24 - me go get that 10 million file here it
33:28 - is thank you to this CS course or
33:31 - something at Princeton that I mean Pi
33:34 - Day whoops where am i processing pi day
33:39 - 5 PI 10 million save this file there I
33:43 - also by the way I have a link to a file
33:46 - with 1 billion digits so what I'm gonna
33:50 - do now let's see so I want to load the
33:54 - 10 million should we make it a 10 page
33:57 - book with 1 million in each page now
34:00 - let's keep it with 10,000 on each page
34:02 - it's not too many pages 10 million oh
34:06 - let me just say book of Pi 10 million so
34:10 - I don't overwrite my other file when
34:12 - this inevitably dies alright let's put
34:15 - let's put like some more ease
34:16 - gonna be a round number ten million
34:17 - divided by four forty thousand probably
34:22 - not anyway let's just keep it to 10,000
34:24 - per page that's just gonna be a thousand
34:27 - pages right yeah or something like that
34:30 - who cares it'll compute it for me ready
34:33 - let's watch the console here we go we
34:38 - just need to get to a thousand pages
34:40 - I'll be back when that happens page 999
34:48 - complete completed so in theory okay
34:51 - okay fell down train whistle in theory
34:55 - this file here
34:57 - woo whoops this is kind of a large file
35:03 - it is 104 megabytes it is a PDF that has
35:08 - a thousand pages in it with a rectangle
35:12 - with a hue map to the digit of pi it has
35:15 - ten digits what has gone on so I have no
35:20 - I've sort of suspect that my computer
35:22 - might have a little trouble opening this
35:24 - file but let's take a deep breath and
35:27 - open it anyway let's close this one and
35:30 - let's open this Oh actually amazingly it
35:35 - did it instantly and there we go all ten
35:40 - all thousand pages all ten thousand
35:43 - digits now I wonder if you might just
35:45 - double check this for me I'm on page 80
35:49 - and if you could just check if this
35:51 - sequence is correct I didn't make any
35:53 - mistakes with my code that would be
35:54 - really nice thank you very much I really
35:56 - want to see it with the digits ah okay
36:00 - but I gotta end this video um I hope
36:02 - that you make something with this make a
36:04 - poster that vid and by the way one I'm
36:07 - limited in my thinking here right
36:09 - because I am thinking only in terms of
36:12 - this works like linear order of columns
36:15 - and rows but it's so arbitrary right the
36:17 - digits of pi are one dimension or
36:19 - perhaps they're in some
36:21 - multi-dimensional space that we can't
36:23 - even understand but the fact that I'm
36:24 - arranging them in this sequence you
36:26 - should remember is completely arbitrary
36:28 - so mutt might be another way that you
36:31 - sequence these or visualize these in a
36:34 - giant PDF whether it's a poster or a
36:36 - book or something else share with me I'm
36:39 - gonna work on my own on making maybe
36:42 - I'll make maybe I know maybe I'll just
36:44 - make another video real quick all right
36:46 - make the text version of this so I'll
36:48 - see you at perhaps if I make that video
36:49 - in that video otherwise have a wonderful
36:51 - pi day I'll see you in 2019
36:54 - [Music]
37:02 - you
