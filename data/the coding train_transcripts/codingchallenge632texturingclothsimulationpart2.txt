00:00 - Alright, Welcome to a coding challenge!
00:03 - erm
00:03 - You might remember me from a previous coding challenge,
00:07 - already in the other video that was the
00:09 - code against our code exists to get into
00:11 - parts it's a code challenging parts this
00:13 - is the second part so what I'm going to
00:15 - do in the second part is take the
00:17 - knowledge from the first part where I'm
00:19 - look at how to texture geometry with an
00:23 - image and apply that to this idea of a
00:25 - cloth simulation to try to make a waving
00:28 - flag with an image on it with our new
00:30 - friends the unikitty so you can see this
00:32 - is kind of happening here there's this
00:34 - crazy images being textures of this of
00:37 - to this geometry and if you didn't watch
00:40 - that video don't know about how the
00:41 - texture function works encourage you to
00:42 - go back to look at first but we're just
00:44 - gonna get started right here so this I
00:46 - I'm for this is kind of a rare thing
00:48 - that I'm doing here where I'm not
00:49 - starting from scratch but i'm actually
00:51 - also building off Cody built from
00:53 - scratch in a previous code Josh you can
00:55 - also go back to lock that one with code
00:57 - challenge number 23 d cloth but here's
01:01 - what I'm going to do so let's say that
01:03 - enough time ready
01:05 - ok so let's look at this the first thing
01:07 - that I want to do is I want to make this
01:09 - more like looking like a flag even
01:12 - before I add a texture
01:14 - let's make it look like a flag so a
01:16 - couple things are going to do number one
01:18 - is this is where i lock the particles so
01:21 - I locked the particle two on the top so
01:23 - if i remember right i could say lock one
01:26 - of the top and one on the bottom and you
01:32 - can see
01:33 - oh that is weird that is weird
01:38 - so another thing i want to do is get rid
01:42 - of this rotating right now it's making
01:45 - it confusing for me to see what's going
01:47 - on let's run it again and see oh ok we
01:56 - will wait
01:57 - oh but there's all this ok let's do
01:59 - something else
02:00 - let's get rid of the gravity for a
02:03 - second let's take out this gravity
02:05 - behavior because that's kind of
02:06 - confusing me what's going on
02:08 - ok so that ought to the orientation is
02:12 - also completely different I forgot about
02:14 - that I oriented the cloth as this thing
02:17 - up so what I actually do what I probably
02:20 - could do it just changed the way the
02:22 - scene is rotated let's see how did i do
02:25 - that so if i if i rotate the whole scene
02:31 - it up here on the x-axis it will be
02:35 - rotate around the x-axis right by 90
02:39 - degrees that work there we go okay
02:43 - the Heritage I i could have to change
02:45 - the way it created but let's just keep
02:46 - it under rotate the whole scene that way
02:48 - and then what I want to do is I let's
02:52 - not confuse myself so where is the
02:55 - gravity pointing is the grabbing what
02:58 - which accesses pointing down and maybe I
03:00 - should reorient the way i do the part
03:02 - that's reorient the way to the particles
03:03 - because it's gonna be way too hard to
03:04 - figure out if i rotate the scene right
03:06 - so this is a better idea
03:08 - look at it I set all the particles with
03:10 - a fixed y & x and v are changing which
03:15 - is YX moves across this way or actually
03:17 - across this way and he moves across this
03:19 - way now I want me to be fixed and x and
03:22 - y to move to all i need to do I think
03:24 - it's just change this to Y and set all
03:29 - the particle locations to Y and have vb
03:32 - some i don't know let's make it 02 I
03:34 - have a feeling that there's going to be
03:36 - a bit of a problem here was going to be
03:37 - in the wrong place
03:38 - it's at the bottom that's no big deal i
03:41 - could say why should start at rose- road
03:44 - times w / 2 so that it starts higher up
03:48 - and you can see there we go now and I
03:51 - want to I want to give myself the more
03:52 - space here because I'm gonna have the
03:54 - nice flag-waving simulation so i think
03:57 - i'm gonna just give myself 800 and I
04:00 - think X should actually start at a
04:03 - i know i'm just gonna sort of hard coat
04:05 - and stuff in here to like shifted over a
04:06 - little bit and that's too much shifted
04:09 - over like this
04:10 - ok so now there we go
04:13 - the other thing I'm gonna do this is
04:14 - kind of silly but i might as well as i'm
04:17 - going to at the end i'm just going to
04:18 - draw a line stroke 255 stroke wait for
04:25 - and i'm going to draw a line from
04:27 - where's the first particle the first
04:29 - particle starts at this location come to
04:31 - this location no boy line from here is
04:35 - you know I should do a better job of
04:36 - thinking about how to organize these
04:38 - variable but i just want to quickly put
04:40 - something to make it look like the flags
04:41 - attached and i'm going to go from that
04:44 - point all the way to the same X and then
04:48 - down to the bottom of the screen there
04:52 - we go
04:53 - so this is the flag but it's not waving
04:55 - or doing anything I'd like to set it
04:57 - back on the z axis or something
04:58 - depending on how things go but now i
05:00 - could put that gravity back into gravity
05:02 - points down let's look at it again
05:06 - oh I need to add the gravity behavior
05:08 - not just look at it and run it again
05:11 - there we go all my goodness look at that
05:13 - flag it's just falling down there's
05:15 - nothing going on to one thing that I
05:16 - want to do is push active with so i want
05:21 - to add the wind and you could try to
05:23 - take out the gravity just in terms of
05:24 - like nothing in here but I want to push
05:27 - it in that other direction so the
05:29 - particle the particle all in an array
05:33 - the particles are in a 2d array and I'm
05:36 - doing all this stuff with them here and
05:39 - then the Sun there's a lot of things i
05:40 - gotta change but one thing that I can do
05:43 - this is all just setting it up sorry
05:44 - perfect this is this is where I want
05:47 - this is a loop that draws all the
05:48 - particles probably as dots or something
05:50 - so let's take out s dot display so what
05:54 - I want to see it's just the particle oh
05:56 - you can't see them
05:57 - so what is the particle display
05:58 - functional to take it out so let's don't
06:02 - know why that was counted out
06:03 - so let's put that back in so these are
06:06 - just the particle and boy they're like
06:09 - they felt quite far away why
06:12 - you should be a 200 right if I
06:16 - transcendental had that coded for before
06:18 - was in the state so if I translated xyb
06:21 - the particle should be drawn at 200 ok
06:24 - there we go there we go
06:26 - ok so this looks like what I expected it
06:28 - to now I can see and I was going to do I
06:30 - think it'll be easier to look at what's
06:31 - going on also if I really really
06:34 - increase the resolution of this so I'm
06:38 - going to make the number of columns and
06:40 - rows that should have to calculate based
06:41 - on each other but i'm just going to make
06:45 - it much so you can see now this message
06:46 - is a left left high-resolution so we can
06:48 - sort of see there too so now what I want
06:50 - to do what I wanted to do here and I
06:52 - don't need to display them if i want to
06:54 - apply force to them so i'm using the
06:57 - toxic with physics engine and it has a
06:59 - function called apply look o it's sad
07:04 - for ya there to add force so this is a
07:07 - function that allows me to arbitrarily
07:09 - add a force to it and I'm going to add a
07:11 - force like and that for should be a
07:14 - vector so I'm cold wind and i'm going to
07:18 - say back to d win equals a new back 2d
07:22 - and at point five comma 0 and we need to
07:29 - be 3d I forget that I've been 3d world
07:31 - so 5 comma 0 comma 0 so now we can see
07:37 - the wind is sort of keeping it up more
07:40 - like a fly here's the thing
07:42 - it's working it kinda looks like a flag
07:45 - it would be much nicer if that wind
07:47 - we're kind of inconsistent and also
07:49 - maybe there is the wind along the z-axis
07:51 - as well and no I always did Perlin noise
07:55 - in these types of situations so whatever
07:58 - bye i'm not even close to the texturing
07:59 - yet apply enclose the texture so let's
08:02 - try to make the wind a bit more
08:03 - interesting one thing that I can do
08:06 - I've got this two-dimensional space
08:07 - which is really perfect here so i can
08:09 - consider an ex offset for Perlin noise
08:11 - and a why off set for Perlin noise and i
08:16 - can say the noise value is annoying x
08:19 - off that y offset
08:20 - and for every column x off should
08:24 - increment by something and for every row
08:27 - y off should increment by something and
08:34 - then actually this should probably be at
08:37 - the bottom that really matter
08:39 - and then what I could do is I could say
08:42 - this is n times 5 and this is n minus
08:47 - 0.5 so I manager should probably be
08:51 - different introduce different values for
08:54 - ok let's let's be let's be let's be
08:58 - better about this let's say because I
09:00 - want to make this look night
09:02 - let's say Windex is noise of X off why
09:06 - off and wind i'm just gonna win z is
09:13 - noise of X off why off and what I'm
09:16 - going to do is I'm just going to like
09:17 - offset these by then it just like look
09:20 - at a different part of the noise space
09:22 - that's like arbitrarily some other
09:24 - number so that i get different values
09:26 - for Windex and wind index for wind X and
09:32 - wind Z and then what I need to do it
09:35 - masks those you know this is a little
09:37 - silly to use a map because the range of
09:40 - going between 0 and 1 and maybe I want
09:42 - to always have some window between one
09:43 - and five always pointing in that
09:45 - direction and then I want to map the
09:48 - though which has a range between 0 and
09:49 - 12 between like negative 11 because II
09:52 - the wind could push in and out and so
09:55 - now if i do that let's see what we get
09:59 - we're getting kind of more like the wind
10:02 - is kind of changing over time
10:04 - here's the thing its kind of settling in
10:06 - i can do even better because it's even
10:10 - though the wind is different in a sort
10:11 - of smooth way through across all the
10:13 - point it's not every frame so i can add
10:17 - a third boy this is like a lot of Perlin
10:19 - noise up for all the texture stuff but
10:21 - it wasn't that i can add a third
10:22 - dimension which is really the frames of
10:24 - animation the time
10:26 - Perlin noise movie is really the x and y
10:29 - is the noise in the 2d space of the flag
10:31 - and
10:32 - these every cycle of animation so what
10:35 - I'm going to do now is I'm actually
10:37 - going to look at the office i can just
10:39 - use the same the offer each alkyl matter
10:42 - and then globally every frame the off
10:45 - will change by some amount so now i
10:48 - believe that i'm going to have something
10:50 - that feels a bit more like wind is
10:53 - changing over time it's not really going
10:55 - to settle in as much i'm sure i could
10:56 - play with the parameters in the amount
10:58 - but you can see we've got our flag and I
11:01 - think I kind of want i think the gravity
11:04 - should maybe not so strong so I'm gonna
11:06 - just make the gravity a little bit
11:08 - weaker and i'm going to go back now to
11:10 - having it the many many more points to
11:14 - also think will be more interesting to
11:15 - look at whoa ok so i hadn't i think i
11:18 - think the wind a bit too strongly really
11:21 - stretching it out
11:22 - this is the kind of thing that really
11:24 - sucks finesse and some playing around
11:28 - i'm not gonna I'm gonna let you if you
11:29 - download this code like play with the
11:31 - parameters a bit more but I could make
11:34 - you cringe a little bit less strong
11:38 - I you know also the strength of the
11:41 - spring is probably a big factor here so
11:45 - if i go into the springs they all get
11:47 - made
11:48 - where do I make the springs they all get
11:51 - made with a strength of point eight so
11:54 - if I made it like a point one I think
11:56 - it's going to make it really crazy
11:57 - flimsy look at that not look at that
11:59 - insanity and I could probably strengthen
12:01 - up a bit by making the strength one
12:03 - which might give it a little bit more so
12:05 - whatever this is better or worse but now
12:07 - we're ready right now we're ready to do
12:10 - the texturing this was the point of this
12:12 - video in the first place
12:13 - so how what's with the geometry that I
12:15 - can texture so what's actually being
12:17 - drawn here if I look inside draw you can
12:20 - see this is actually where the flag is
12:22 - being drawn every spring is a connection
12:25 - between two points and desktop display
12:28 - what does that do it draws a line
12:30 - between those two point so now what I
12:33 - need to do is I don't want to do this
12:34 - anymore
12:35 - that's not going to work for me what I
12:38 - need to do and I think I i think i want
12:40 - to do this in another loop because this
12:43 - is rich
12:43 - because crazy but I need a loop of
12:45 - columns and rows I need to render this
12:48 - with the particle so i need to go back
12:52 - to a particle dot display particle index
13:00 - I index J dot display so let's just make
13:03 - sure this works
13:04 - so now I'm rendering it a lot of points
13:06 - and I just want to make that easier to
13:09 - see that they can just point smaller and
13:13 - you can see that out so this is really
13:14 - what it is it's a whole lot of point
13:16 - remember that triangle strip thing all i
13:18 - need to do is fill it with tribal trips
13:20 - now from top to bottom
13:22 - ok could you add one or two more locked
13:27 - point I definitely could so I maybe
13:29 - that's a good suggestion be able to do
13:30 - that I'm kind of event of us will add
13:32 - that little bit later but that's not a
13:34 - bad idea to lock a few more points to
13:36 - the to the to the pole and it would be
13:39 - too hard to do that would just be a
13:40 - matter of picking some other points to
13:42 - add right here
13:43 - ok so what I need to do now though is I
13:46 - need the ex and I need the white and
13:58 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
14:01 - turn off the physics just for a second
14:03 - so how do with the easiest way for me to
14:04 - do that just comment about physics dot
14:06 - updates so if I comment on physics that
14:08 - update when I don't like it there should
14:12 - be no physics but i forgot to say
14:13 - anything so we want to make sure that
14:15 - still work so there it is but no physics
14:18 - there's the flag
14:19 - ok so now i wonder if I rest length is
14:22 - off to that something to think about but
14:24 - um so now what I'm going to do is I'm
14:27 - going to say begin shape and end shape
14:33 - and once they begin shake point and i'm
14:37 - going to say vertex and oh my goodness I
14:41 - cannot believe that after i really need
14:44 - to be here is a vertex X Y Z let's see
14:51 - what we get
14:52 - so now we should get there's my geometry
14:55 - it's just a set of point
14:56 - okay we're good shape ok so now I don't
15:01 - want I don't want a point when I want
15:04 - our triangle strips so triangle strip so
15:11 - this is going to be wildly off but let's
15:12 - let's run this week what happened oh my
15:14 - goodness I can't even make any sense of
15:16 - this whatsoever
15:17 - let's make sure there's no Phil let's
15:20 - make sure the stroke weight is just one
15:24 - and let's lower the resolution get boy I
15:27 - I just drives me crazy i want to have a
15:29 - variable something called variable
15:31 - resolution and i'm going to call it a
15:34 - day if one and then i'm going to say
15:37 - 4240 / resolution 40 / resolution can
15:42 - make us afloat i guess and then I'm
15:44 - gonna stay with is w x resolution so
15:47 - this way so no this just needs to be in
15:51 - it
15:52 - ok I'm this way that should be exactly
15:54 - what I had before and then it's hard to
15:57 - see and then if i change this 22 I
16:01 - should go see the better if i change
16:02 - this to for you could be okay so this is
16:07 - not right
16:07 - obviously it's drawing some crazy mutant
16:10 - triangle stripping that's not right
16:12 - so what's the issue here the main thing
16:14 - if it that I that I think will make this
16:16 - a lot easier to deal with is that I
16:19 - right now that loop that the columns is
16:22 - on the outer loop so it actually
16:25 - actually think for every column go
16:27 - through all the road could have the
16:29 - triangle service code count could be for
16:32 - everyone mentally think you've been
16:33 - going across so I actually want to have
16:35 - the columns in the interviews but I
16:37 - think for every row go do all the
16:40 - columns but do the column and it's
16:43 - really for every why do all the exits
16:45 - and do the x 22 x and y & x and y plus
16:50 - the next one
16:51 - so in other words what I'm saying is
16:53 - I don't know if that was clear but I
16:55 - want this to be in here just the way I'm
16:57 - thinking about it and then what i want
16:59 - to say is give me two different wide
17:02 - like give me why one actually need all
17:07 - of them the x11 why I need x1 y1 and z1
17:11 - and then I need the one that's right
17:16 - below it right because the triangle
17:18 - strip is going to connect to the chiro
17:19 - that's below so i need to say then x2 y2
17:25 - z2 and what is the one below
17:27 - k plus 1 j plus 1 j plus 12 joke then I
17:31 - can have another vertex 2 22 ok so i
17:38 - have two vertices and now let's take a
17:41 - look at what this does books already
17:46 - indexed out about of course
17:48 - so what's the problem i can't do the
17:49 - last grow anymore because I ever every
17:52 - Rod looking at two so i have to say Jay
17:54 - listen Rose minus 1 i'll get rid of that
17:57 - error and you'll be okay so this kind of
18:00 - looks right but there's all this stuff
18:02 - like connecting back to the beginning so
18:04 - the thing is the triangles trips each
18:06 - row has to be a distinct unit so even
18:09 - though i begin shakin and shit for the
18:11 - whole thing and when i get to the end
18:13 - when i get to the edge over here and
18:14 - have to connect all the way back to the
18:15 - beginning I could try to do something
18:16 - clever words kind of wraps around what's
18:18 - going to make it much simpler if I could
18:20 - just say let's actually begin the
18:22 - triangle strip for every row and end the
18:26 - triangle strip for every row and now you
18:28 - can see that i now have this whole flag
18:31 - is trying trip but we're really close
18:34 - now and I can go back and i can change
18:36 - the resolution 22 and we can see still
18:39 - the same thing this whole flag as
18:41 - triangle strips so now what do I do
18:43 - here's the good part now what I do is I
18:47 - need to load the image so it's time to
18:49 - say pms unikitty then i'm going to say
18:54 - no one looking at the bottom
19:00 - unikitty equals loadimage unikitty
19:04 - jpg in that file detective in the data
19:07 - folder for the processing sketch which
19:09 - you can see that it is right there and
19:12 - now I can say right here texture
19:16 - unikitty and all I need now are the UV
19:21 - coordinates so what are the UV
19:23 - coordinate well you is a value X what
19:31 - did I jay i goes between 0 and columns
19:35 - and the image pixels go between 0 &
19:38 - unikitty dot with I could use normalized
19:41 - texture coordinates so that they just
19:43 - goes between 0 and 1 probably makes
19:45 - things easier to kind nice to do that we
19:47 - actually do that but if you think I'll
19:50 - do that and that's a texture mode is it
19:55 - normal this way i can just do this i
20:00 - don't really need map even I could just
20:02 - take I and / so this actually makes
20:04 - things simpler because I can take I and
20:06 - / column whatever i'm gonna keep map
20:09 - which I which has a range between 0 and
20:12 - column now can have that between 0 and 1
20:14 - and V which has j your range between 0
20:20 - and rose to have a also between 0 & 1
20:24 - so now you v and then the next vertex
20:31 - all i need to do is redo j and ask for j
20:36 - plus 1 right
20:37 - they need the meat you can be the same
20:39 - right
20:40 - it's the same X values but I'm looking
20:42 - for the pixel in the row below so if he
20:45 - has to be run up j plus 1 and and be
20:49 - here all my goodness i'm in front of my
20:50 - code so uh so so I think this should
20:55 - work
20:55 - Rose minus 1 this is a good point it
20:58 - really should be called minus 1 and
21:00 - rose- 1i think that's right Rose minus 1
21:04 - because the range is actually there's
21:06 - ten columns the range 30
21:07 - tonight I think that's right so I'm
21:10 - going to say v1 the v2 v1 and v2 so now
21:15 - if we run this we should see you
21:19 - indicating the flag there we go
21:22 - this is so exciting so a unikitty is on
21:26 - the flag now we can do is put the
21:29 - physics backline I need a unit kitty
21:32 - song to play and now we have the
21:36 - University flag there is the unity
21:38 - flagyl all of a sudden it's not
21:39 - stretching out so much what I do that I
21:42 - think things left crazier than it was
21:44 - before up and by the way now i really
21:46 - want to just take off this is this would
21:48 - be a little bit nicer if I had a
21:49 - non-square image that could make a
21:52 - little bit wider also invented the
21:54 - College of Rosewood after the equal to
21:55 - the square flag is a little bit strange
21:57 - but i'm going to say no stroke I would
22:01 - really like to maybe increase its wind
22:05 - or whatever but I've got done so here we
22:08 - go you can make your own creative
22:10 - version of this if the unikitty flag i
22:12 - took a beautiful drawing oven unikitty i
22:15 - have textured it all just geometry in
22:17 - processing i have added specifics with
22:19 - the tacticals library and it is the
22:22 - unity flag
22:23 - thank you very much and I was meeting
22:25 - tonight at my last college after I feel
22:27 - like what else could you possibly ever
22:28 - want to make after this i'm sure i'll be
22:30 - back very tired right now you're
22:32 - watching this in the future words it's
22:33 - like one video but i think the time
22:35 - under live streaming today I mean my our
22:37 - number five so later in the next video
22:41 - sometimes have a good day evening
22:42 - morning whatever time it is for you go
22:44 - get somebody a hug drawn unikitty
22:46 - calculator
