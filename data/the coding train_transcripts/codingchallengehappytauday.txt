00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - happy holiday everybody take point 2.80
00:07 - there's no point there six point two
00:10 - eight three one eight five three oh
00:15 - seven one seven nine five okay welcome
00:25 - to a special just me wasting time on the
00:33 - internet but you know it's worth noting
00:36 - the day we i noted pi day and I made a
00:40 - coding challenge which was an
00:42 - approximating PI by using a kind of dart
00:46 - throwing technique let me close all this
00:48 - stuff up we can run the example right
00:51 - here the idea is I'm throwing darts into
00:53 - my processing canvas and the ratio of
00:57 - the number of darts that land outside of
01:00 - the circle versus inside the circle give
01:02 - me the value of pi now one of the
01:03 - comments I got so much on this video was
01:07 - but you're using PI to calculate pi well
01:12 - no I'm not and I want to be clear about
01:14 - this I'm going to comment out all of
01:19 - these lines of code right here and I'm
01:21 - gonna say print line pi so there we go
01:27 - we can see my approximation of pi right
01:30 - here now I am sort of using PI in the
01:34 - sense that probably the value of pi is
01:38 - used where is that ellipse function
01:41 - somewhere in here no wait I thought
01:44 - maybe I use the ellipse function oh I do
01:46 - in where this ellipse function is drama
01:49 - let me comment this out so now I am not
01:54 - using the ellipse function which
01:55 - probably behind the scenes is using PI
01:57 - and I am I am only using the reason why
02:01 - I'm seeing a circle is because I am
02:03 - calculating the distance of each point
02:06 - to the center and checking if it's below
02:08 - a certain amount and if it's below a
02:10 - certain amount it means it's inside a
02:11 - circle
02:12 - let's just look here the only place
02:15 - where I might be calling math.pi is now
02:18 - commented out I was just using that to
02:20 - compare okay so we can see here that
02:24 - this is in fact not using Chi but giving
02:27 - me this meant now why does this work now
02:29 - I already covered this in the previous
02:30 - video so you totally could just go away
02:32 - and do something else right now
02:34 - but if you don't want to go watch the
02:36 - previous video the reason why this works
02:38 - just to talk about it again is if this
02:41 - is a square and this is a circle right
02:47 - the area and this is a value called R
02:52 - the value of the sorry the area of the
02:58 - square is each side of this square is to
03:03 - R so the area of that square is 2 R
03:05 - squared 2 R squared or 4 R the area of
03:12 - the circle as we know maybe from some
03:16 - math class is PI R squared so here I am
03:20 - using the idea of pi but only only
03:23 - because I know that that's the
03:25 - definition of the area of a circle now
03:28 - what if I were to just throw darts at
03:30 - the wall and I would count how many
03:31 - darts landed in the circle versus how
03:35 - many darts landed overall that would be
03:38 - the same so the total darts divided by
03:42 - the circle only should be equal to well
03:46 - this before our squared for R squared
03:49 - divided by PI R squared so now what I
03:52 - want to do is solve for pi well first of
03:57 - all the R squared can be is gone so then
04:01 - I could say 4 times total divided by
04:06 - circle total equals 1 divided by PI ok I
04:11 - just flipped those right so pi equals
04:17 - the circle total divided by 4 times the
04:23 - total total
04:25 - that seems kind of right oops I always
04:29 - get my math wrong okay guess what
04:34 - everybody all right let's do this again
04:39 - okay so now if I reverse these I could
04:43 - say pi divided by four equals the circle
04:47 - and it should say Circle T like the
04:48 - circle total divided by the total now I
04:52 - can just multiply each side by four and
04:54 - I could say four times circle T divided
04:57 - by total equals PI or PI equals this and
04:59 - we go back to my code we have four times
05:04 - the total number that landed in the
05:06 - circle x divided by the total overall so
05:10 - that's there so now what if I want to
05:14 - approximate oh well what is tau tau by
05:21 - the way is okay so what's the
05:24 - circumference of this circle meaning
05:28 - what's the length of the arc all the way
05:31 - around to PI R well that seems like an
05:38 - awkward way of writing it why do I have
05:41 - to have this to here what if I just had
05:43 - a value that instead of being PI was
05:47 - twice the value of pi then I could say
05:49 - the circumference is just that value
05:51 - times R and that's what tau is Oh
05:53 - something it's a Greek letter that I've
05:56 - totally botched let me go look up how to
05:58 - draw that better so here's the Greek
06:01 - letter write uppercase to lowercase
06:02 - towel so I can go back and son so I do
06:05 - the worst job here I guess it yeah that
06:09 - kind of that'll be so I could say it's a
06:10 - tau R and guess what if R is one the
06:13 - circumference of the unit circle is tau
06:17 - the circumference of the unit circle is
06:21 - tau naught 2 pi I don't know people now
06:27 - enjoy the comment section of this video
06:29 - everybody so here's the thing what if I
06:32 - want to approximate tau
06:35 - okay oh boy oh boy okay
06:40 - well the area of the circle is still 4r
06:43 - squared and the area of the fittest -
06:49 - I'm sorry the area of the square is
06:51 - still 4 R squared but the area of the
06:53 - circle pie
06:54 - well no no pi divided a Tau what is it
06:57 - with town Town town divided by 2 pi
07:00 - divided by 2 R squared okay so yeah I
07:03 - love this is super nice I gotta say it's
07:07 - tau divided by 2 5 to 2 where do I want
07:10 - the - welcome to here to there but let's
07:19 - say I do this then the total weight for
07:25 - R squared or tau divided by 2 R squared
07:33 - so the R's get cancelled out that this
07:37 - becomes an 8 and so now the value of tau
07:41 - guess what you just double it it's just
07:43 - double its how it's just double pi PI is
07:46 - just half towel whatever you want just
07:49 - live your life tau and PI just ate and
07:55 - then this is tau so we now can go and
07:58 - revise my coding job that's really
08:02 - you're still watching this video
08:04 - apparently I'm gonna stop this and we're
08:07 - going to we're gonna make one of these
08:08 - for all of you tau lovers out there this
08:11 - one goes out to all you tau lovers out
08:13 - there from me to you we're gonna change
08:16 - this to record towel we're gonna draw
08:22 - that we don't need to draw that this is
08:24 - unnecessary code just save this before I
08:28 - forget it's approximating towel and I'm
08:30 - just put this on the desktop of my
08:31 - computer
08:32 - this is processing it's Java processing
08:35 - org everybody always asks then I'm going
08:38 - to come down here well I don't need to
08:39 - do so many each frame my formula here is
08:44 - now 8 tau is a
08:48 - and I can now what I want to do is I
08:52 - need to check the record Tao if I get
08:56 - one closest cuz redo the record and then
09:01 - now and this is now Tao and then ah this
09:04 - is just math Tao and math dot tau all
09:07 - right oh and this is record Tao
09:11 - okay we're good I did it I redid my
09:13 - coding on what what Java dot math hmm
09:34 - where are the constants where are the
09:36 - constants hold on
09:39 - math doc hi Java hmm yep
09:45 - pi oh there we go here are the constants
09:48 - e
09:49 - we get e we get PI I don't see tau I
09:54 - don't see towel this video is over
09:56 - forget it done
09:58 - all right fine I'll devote to it anyway
10:01 - anyway but this is so sad this is what I
10:05 - have to do look away everybody look away
10:08 - don't look don't look
10:12 - and now we are now approximating tau
10:20 - happy tile day everybody see ya
10:27 - [Music]
10:32 - you
