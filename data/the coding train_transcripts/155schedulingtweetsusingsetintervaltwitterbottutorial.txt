00:00 - in this video I'm going to look at how
00:02 - you can use the set interval function to
00:05 - schedule tweets from the bots in node so
00:09 - we already have working from the
00:11 - previous video an example that makes the
00:13 - status post to the Twitter API and has a
00:16 - callback to tell us whether it didn't
00:17 - work or work so now what I need to do is
00:19 - what if I want this particular program
00:22 - to do this every five minutes or once an
00:25 - hour how would I add that to the program
00:27 - the other thing I'll show you in this
00:28 - video is how you can have the bot tweet
00:30 - based on a particular event so the
00:32 - example that I'll use in this video is
00:34 - anytime someone follows me I'll also
00:36 - tweet back saying like you know thank
00:38 - you for following me or something
00:39 - there's a lot of other kind of events
00:40 - and eventually at some point I want to
00:42 - look at if someone tweets at mentions me
00:44 - with an image going to process that
00:46 - image and send the image back but we'll
00:49 - get to I'll get to that in future videos
00:50 - but and this one is going to look at
00:51 - scheduling the tweets and using the
00:53 - Twitter API stream to have tweets happen
00:56 - based on a given event okay so the good
00:59 - news is we already have this this is all
01:02 - the code that I need for posting a tweet
01:05 - tweeting a tweet twittering twittering
01:07 - twittering okay
01:09 - so what I want the first thing I might
01:11 - do is just wrap this in a function and
01:13 - I'm going to call this function tweet it
01:15 - because apparently everything has to
01:18 - start with TW in this example in this so
01:20 - I'm going to take all of this code and
01:23 - I'm going to indent this a little bit I
01:26 - don't have like sublime settings them in
01:29 - a different user account this force for
01:31 - space indent I can't I have to tolerate
01:34 - it for the purpose of this video I'm
01:35 - definitely gonna fix that for a future
01:36 - video two spaces two spaces I much
01:38 - prefer but you shouldn't be like that
01:39 - you should welcome any kind of spaces
01:41 - for your indentation you that should be
01:43 - the kind of person you are but the point
01:44 - is look I have this now in a function so
01:47 - anytime I were to call this function if
01:52 - I call that function boom its kind of
01:54 - post a tweet now one thing that I might
01:56 - have an issue of like so I could run
01:58 - this right now and I'm gonna say node
02:00 - bot I have a feeling I might get an
02:02 - error something went wrong so why does
02:05 - something go wrong the reason why I sent
02:06 - something went wrong is I just run this
02:08 - example and I made the same exact tweet
02:11 - two times in a row
02:13 - so Twitter doesn't like that Twitter's
02:15 - like you that's a duplicate status and
02:17 - it's not I could have gotten a better
02:18 - error message down here to look at what
02:20 - that error actually is but I just don't
02:22 - have done this before I know that was an
02:23 - error so something that you know it
02:25 - doesn't really make sense to have a
02:26 - Twitter bot anyway that posts the same
02:27 - tweet every so often there is actually a
02:30 - page on Twitter's website I'll try to
02:32 - link to it that you do kind of like the
02:33 - rules that you should follow for because
02:36 - bots are allowed but there's certain
02:37 - kinds of do's and don'ts in terms of
02:40 - what Twitter allows for a bot but one
02:42 - thing that I could do really quickly is
02:43 - I could just say let's make this a
02:45 - random number bot so I could say in my
02:48 - tweet it function I could say R is a
02:51 - random number between 0 and 100 and
02:56 - maybe I'm going to use the floor
02:59 - function so it's not it doesn't have a
03:02 - decimal point so I'm getting 0 5 integer
03:04 - a whole number and then in my tweet I
03:06 - could say the status is here is a random
03:12 - number plus R plus coding rainbow from
03:19 - nodejs hopefully that's not more than
03:21 - 140 characters I think that's fine so
03:24 - now at least each tweet will be
03:25 - different because I'm getting a random
03:27 - number so let's run this again and see
03:30 - it worked and now if I go to the browser
03:33 - and look at my account page refresh you
03:37 - could say here is a random number 3000
03:39 - and I forgot to put a space between the
03:41 - number and the hash symbol so my super
03:44 - important hashtag is gone so let me add
03:47 - that space back in and you can see there
03:49 - we go I this is a bot a bot that tweets
03:51 - a random number I mean the point of me
03:53 - making these videos is that just trying
03:55 - to show you how to do it and so it's up
03:57 - to you now to come up with a much more
03:58 - creative or interesting idea and I'll
04:00 - try to include some links to interesting
04:02 - BOTS and examples and ideas that might
04:04 - help you get started in this video's
04:06 - description but the real key here now is
04:08 - this is happening just once what if I
04:11 - want this to happen every so often the
04:14 - way that I can do that is by using a
04:16 - function in JavaScript called set
04:17 - interval and the set interval function
04:20 - is a function that says trigger this
04:23 - particular fun
04:24 - tweet it every how some number of
04:27 - milliseconds so what I could say is a
04:30 - thousand milliseconds would be one
04:32 - second
04:33 - a thousand times ten would be ten
04:35 - seconds so a thousand times sixty would
04:37 - be sixty seconds or a minute times five
04:39 - would be every five minutes times 60
04:42 - would be once an hour so it's up to you
04:44 - how often you want your bot to run again
04:47 - you want to read that Twitter page that
04:49 - explains like you know if you're posting
04:51 - tweets like every 10 milliseconds
04:53 - they're probably going to shut down your
04:54 - account I imagine I don't know what
04:56 - those parameters are off the top of my
04:57 - head but for our purposes right now
04:59 - let's see if we can get away with like
05:01 - tweeting every 20 seconds just briefly
05:04 - so we could at least see this run and
05:06 - the one thing I might also do is
05:08 - actually when my bot starts exquisite
05:11 - explicitly call tweet it once because
05:15 - the first time this is going to run is
05:17 - only 20 seconds in so I don't have to
05:19 - think of something to do for 20 seconds
05:21 - while we're waiting but let's run the
05:24 - bot and say node bot J s so it worked it
05:28 - did tweet something and probably would
05:30 - make sense for me to do something better
05:32 - in the console like print out the tweet
05:33 - that it actually tweeted I'm rambling
05:35 - out for this probably take me 20 seconds
05:37 - to go back over here refresh this page
05:39 - and you can see I got the number 18 from
05:43 - nodejs
05:44 - and now I'm go back to node and uh wait
05:48 - here oh it works it did another one that
05:50 - was 20 seconds and I'm gonna come back
05:52 - here and sit hit refresh and look I got
05:54 - the number 72
05:55 - now I'm quickly going to go here and hit
05:57 - ctrl C which is going to stop the thing
05:59 - from running because I don't want to
06:00 - tweet too often from this account right
06:02 - now but you can see this is it all of
06:05 - these videos of all this like setting up
06:07 - and getting your account and working
06:08 - with node it boils down to actually
06:10 - something really quite easy which is
06:12 - just a matter of having a single
06:13 - function that posts the tweet and a
06:16 - single function set interval that
06:17 - schedules it now of course the real work
06:20 - for you is what goes here
06:22 - like why you making a bot is it to be
06:24 - you know to just try a playful
06:26 - experiment is it to do something
06:28 - practical to help deliver information is
06:30 - it to make a political statement or to
06:33 - provoke some thought you know there's
06:35 - lots of different kinds
06:37 - creative reasons why you might want to
06:39 - make a bot and I think it's kind of a
06:41 - unique form of expression that is really
06:48 - something that I think that I'm like so
06:51 - tired for making these videos for hours
06:52 - this way but I think it's I'm excited to
06:53 - see that those of you who are maybe just
06:55 - coming to this for the first time what
06:56 - kinds of things you might make so please
06:58 - share those if you end up making stuff
07:00 - in the comments that would be helpful
07:01 - and interesting to me so now let's look
07:04 - at one more aspect of this so if you
07:07 - remember that these are the three kinds
07:12 - of things that you can do with the
07:13 - Twitter API you could search the Twitter
07:15 - API so one of the things you might do is
07:17 - I could search for all the tweets with a
07:18 - given term and then I could make up a
07:20 - tweet from those tweets and send it back
07:22 - on with posts but the thing that we
07:24 - haven't seen is this stream so how do
07:28 - you set up a stream so first of all
07:30 - there's a couple things there are
07:31 - different kinds of streams and the
07:34 - stream that I'm going to demonstrate to
07:35 - you is a stream called a user stream the
07:38 - reason why I want to set up the user
07:39 - stream is I want to get an event for
07:41 - certain kinds of actions if someone
07:44 - favorites one of my tweets if someone
07:45 - follows me if someone retweets me if
07:47 - someone at replies me so you can get did
07:50 - an event and let's start with just the
07:52 - follow event which i think is one of the
07:53 - easier ones to work with now I don't
07:57 - actually have the code for this off the
07:58 - top of my head I'm going to just kind of
08:00 - grab it from over here for a second
08:03 - which I prefer to like type it out but
08:06 - I'm just going to do this from a
08:08 - previous example so I'm going to leave
08:10 - this down here so this particular this
08:14 - particular interval is going to keep
08:16 - going to go as well but I'm going to add
08:17 - something to this particular bot so I'm
08:20 - going to add these two lines of code set
08:23 - up a stream a user stream remember T is
08:25 - a reference to the API connection to the
08:28 - API the twit package so I'm going to set
08:31 - up a user stream and then I'm going to
08:33 - assign use the on function so I have a
08:35 - reference to that stream the on function
08:37 - assigns a callback followed to a
08:41 - particular event follow so different
08:43 - things can go there follow favorite re
08:46 - tweet tweet there's lots of other kinds
08:48 - of things that you could
08:49 - at the Twitter API doc streaming
08:51 - documentation I could pull that up for
08:54 - you but I'll include a link in the video
08:56 - description somebody remind me if I
08:58 - didn't but now what it's up to me is to
09:01 - write this followed function so as long
09:06 - as I write a function called followed
09:08 - this code will access a callback an
09:10 - event callback just like when I press
09:12 - the mouse this happens when I press when
09:14 - I move a slider you know with the Dom
09:16 - element this event happens this is a
09:18 - function to handle a follow event for
09:20 - this stream so any time anybody ever
09:22 - follows me this code will be executed
09:24 - what could I do in here
09:26 - well one is I could just call tweet it
09:28 - so anytime somebody follows me that's
09:30 - when I tweet a random number but maybe
09:32 - what you want to do is actually what you
09:36 - might want to do is send a reply so how
09:38 - do you know who followed you well if you
09:41 - add an argument to your callback like
09:44 - data or like event or I think I used in
09:47 - my example that I pre made it called an
09:49 - event message I probably got that from
09:50 - somebody else is an example the reason I
09:52 - call it event message is what is the
09:55 - message what is the data associated with
09:56 - this particular event so there are
09:59 - various pieces of data and again I'm
10:01 - just going to grab them from here
10:02 - because I have them already whoops I'm
10:08 - and I'm going to paste those in here now
10:11 - I'm gonna have like my indentation is
10:14 - all off so you can see here now on I
10:17 - called it just event so if I'm calling
10:19 - an event message I need to be consistent
10:22 - here so that is just JSON data it's data
10:25 - it's an object that has all the metadata
10:28 - all the things associated with that
10:29 - particular follow event and again you
10:31 - could go to the Twitter API to look at
10:32 - how that JSON structure and what type of
10:34 - things you might get but here I can get
10:36 - the user's name and their screening so
10:38 - screen name is our actual twitter
10:39 - twitter account name so perhaps what I
10:42 - want to do now is say something like at
10:46 - plus screen name plus thank you for
10:52 - following me that's so lame do you like
10:56 - rainbows I don't ask a question so of
11:00 - course you can absolutely be different
11:01 - but this is how now I could
11:03 - now that I haven't actually made the
11:05 - tweeted function to handle like
11:07 - receiving a parameter but I could
11:09 - actually receiving an argument with the
11:11 - tweet but I could add that now so this
11:13 - is the idea this event occurs I get some
11:15 - metadata and I then post a tweet back so
11:18 - in a minute if any of you who are
11:19 - watching live I'm going to ask you to
11:21 - follow the account a-to-z ITP but but
11:26 - let's let's let's get a little further
11:27 - here so if you notice here this
11:30 - particular tweeted function it already
11:32 - has this status set with it so what I'm
11:37 - going to do now i think is i'm gonna i'm
11:41 - gonna i'm going to just comment there's
11:43 - a way that i could do I'm just going to
11:44 - comment the interval out actually
11:45 - because we don't need that for this and
11:47 - I'm going to put the I'm going to put a
11:50 - argument here just called txt for text
11:52 - like so that whenever I call this
11:54 - tweeted function the text that gets
11:57 - passed in that's the thing that's that's
11:59 - tweeted and then I could instead of
12:02 - having the random number stuff that I
12:03 - did in the previous video I'm just going
12:06 - to put that variable right here in there
12:07 - and I can get rid of this random number
12:09 - stuff so I really should have made this
12:11 - two separate examples I'm going to have
12:12 - to backtrack to to save it but you can
12:15 - see now in this particular followed
12:17 - function I call the tweeted function I
12:19 - pass this tweet that I made and I send
12:22 - it through and I post it so let's hope
12:26 - this works and the only way you know
12:27 - this is the thing I don't know how to
12:29 - test this other than have somebody
12:30 - follow me but I can kind of like hope
12:32 - that this really works so here we go
12:34 - let's run this bot and let's make sure
12:37 - just to make sure we're in the right
12:38 - place I'm going to say I'm going to call
12:39 - this the follow bot so I'm going to
12:41 - change that to the follow bot is
12:43 - starting so that I know and I'm going to
12:45 - say clear I'm going to say node and you
12:48 - know I just still like watch how things
12:49 - are going I probably should add
12:51 - something here like console dot log
12:54 - follow event just to see that this
12:59 - happens and yeah so let's let's go with
13:03 - this it could add more to that and run
13:06 - this the follow bot is starting okay
13:07 - somebody follow me
13:08 - it's a the account name is A to Z ITP
13:12 - okay so follow it out account name I'm
13:14 - going to go do it from over here because
13:15 - I'm
13:16 - already on Twitter on another laptop I
13:19 - already follow this accountant unfollow
13:21 - and follow come on everything this is
13:26 - like the it worked okay people are
13:28 - following nevermind so we can go back
13:30 - now so people watching this live we're
13:32 - following and so I can refresh this page
13:34 - and uh you know so it's not showing up
13:38 - here the reason why it's not showing up
13:40 - here is because it's an ACK reply which
13:42 - only shows up on the website under this
13:43 - tweet so you can say does robot do you
13:45 - like rainbows J Brian frost or do you
13:47 - like rainbows so it's working if I
13:49 - wanted to show up on the main page one
13:51 - thing I might add is just to this I
13:53 - might add a dot here so that the @ @
13:56 - symbol is not the first part of the
13:58 - tweet and I could go back and run it
14:01 - again and maybe somebody else can
14:03 - unfollow and follow me again unfollowing
14:05 - follow me again or somebody else has
14:06 - done it yet could could follow and will
14:08 - see this happen so hopefully this gives
14:11 - you like a nice picture of what's
14:12 - possible right I previously showed you
14:15 - just how you know you just have a
14:17 - function that sends a tweet you could
14:19 - use the set interval to schedule that
14:21 - function at a particular point in time
14:22 - or you could put a post a tweet based on
14:26 - a particular event a follow event now I
14:28 - do have an excel I will in a future
14:29 - video go over what might be the most
14:31 - useful is if somebody @ mentions you
14:33 - right because you want to bot that just
14:34 - participate I think this is really that
14:36 - an interesting question here are you
14:38 - making a bot that's just sort of like a
14:40 - thing that doesn't know about the world
14:41 - and is just automatically posting are
14:44 - you making a bot that somehow
14:45 - participating in the conversation on
14:46 - Twitter is it reading tweets and
14:49 - responding to treats and and and what
14:51 - does that mean to have something that's
14:52 - a human or not a human but made by a
14:53 - human there's lots of wonderful
14:55 - questions that this opens up that I hope
14:57 - you will explore from watching these
14:58 - videos and making creative projects
15:00 - let's just see oh look all these follows
15:02 - happen if I go back here we can see now
15:05 - bot wiki org is watching hi bot wiki org
15:09 - all of you wonderful people so there we
15:12 - go
15:12 - this gives you cut like the tools you
15:14 - can stop now go for the rest of your day
15:16 - make BOTS let me know tweet at me I Pat
15:18 - Schiffman anything you make I would love
15:20 - to hear about it but I even though it's
15:22 - 12:30 in the doing this for two hours I
15:24 - am firmly committed to pushing through
15:27 - it doing one more video where I show you
15:29 - how to
15:30 - generate an image from processing and
15:32 - have that image have that image get
15:35 - posted along with your tweet which i
15:37 - think is a really opens up a lot of
15:39 - doors and then I'll just have to
15:39 - hopefully later today or tomorrow or
15:41 - next week come back and look at a few
15:43 - more scenarios of like getting
15:45 - downloading images and processing them
15:47 - I'm not gonna get to all that today for
15:48 - sure okay
15:50 - so here we go 15 minutes in I'm going to
15:52 - move this
