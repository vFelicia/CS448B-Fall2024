00:00 - hello welcome to a coding challenge in
00:02 - this coding challenge I'm going to take
00:03 - something I made in a previous coding
00:06 - challenge a flappy bird clone and add
00:08 - two features to it one is something I've
00:10 - just been wanting to do because I think
00:11 - I've sort of really poor job of
00:13 - developing an algorithm to pick the pipe
00:16 - locations and so I want to improve that
00:19 - algorithms talk about that in a second
00:20 - the other thing that I want to do is
00:22 - instead of I want to change the
00:23 - interaction instead of pressing the
00:25 - mouse I want to be able to clap and when
00:29 - I clap I want to be able to control the
00:32 - little flappy bird by clapping so let me
00:34 - first talk about the pipe thing so the
00:36 - way that I picked when I did this coding
00:40 - challenge first time what I did is I
00:42 - thought of the center of the window and
00:46 - then I picked I made up pipes randomly
00:49 - from zero to the middle with some random
00:53 - height and then one from the bottom from
00:55 - zero some random height from from the
00:57 - bottom to the middle in that sense it is
01:02 - impossible for me to have ever picked
01:05 - this as a set of pipes because the pipe
01:08 - can never go below the middle with the
01:10 - random algorithm that I'm using I think
01:13 - what would be better is to pick a random
01:15 - distance right what is the distance
01:18 - between that is going to be the empty
01:20 - space that you have to fly through and
01:21 - then I could also pick a random maybe
01:25 - center point for that distance or I
01:27 - could just kind of pick a random height
01:29 - I don't have to figure that out but well
01:32 - I'll figure that out as we do it but
01:33 - that would certainly that's the sort of
01:34 - core building block like how much space
01:36 - do you have and then following that
01:38 - where is that space so let's try to add
01:40 - this improvement and I'm watching the
01:42 - chat before you have anybody has any
01:44 - better suggestions Here I am back so
01:46 - let's look at this code oops I'm in the
01:48 - wrong place pipe so notice how top is
01:53 - random height divided by two bottom is
01:56 - random height divided by two so this is
01:57 - fine that can still ultimately be the
02:00 - two values that matter right what is
02:03 - this value top and what is this value
02:05 - bottom it's just more how do I arrive at
02:08 - those points so let's do it let's look
02:11 - at where I create the oh I this is where
02:13 - I
02:13 - in it so let me instead save our spacing
02:17 - equals random night so what's a good
02:19 - amount of spacing like if it's really
02:21 - easy like the lowest amount you should
02:24 - have is maybe 20 pixels let's just say
02:26 - then the most you should have is like
02:28 - half the actual window so this is the
02:32 - amount of spacing and I could say now
02:35 - just to like see if this works I could
02:36 - say it is height divided by top is
02:40 - height divided by two minus spacing
02:42 - divided by two and bottom is height
02:45 - divided by two plus spacing divided by
02:48 - two so let's just see if that works so
02:49 - to speak so I'm picking it about oh this
02:53 - is not working
02:54 - haha what did I get wrong here oh I
03:01 - forgot this is not the location of the
03:06 - bar like which would be the height plus
03:08 - the spacing it's the it's the actual
03:14 - length of it so that is also should be
03:16 - minus spacing there we go and this can
03:20 - be divided by two divided by two and so
03:24 - now you can see and I can put these back
03:27 - so now we're picking that random spacing
03:29 - and but that amount of spacing is always
03:32 - around the center so what I want now to
03:36 - be possible is that that that you know
03:41 - kind of like where the center of it is
03:43 - also random so on the one hand I could
03:46 - say I could say like var Center Y is any
03:50 - random point between zero and height and
03:52 - in which case I'm saying the top is
03:55 - Center Y minus spacing divided by two
03:58 - and the bottom is Center Y minus spacing
04:02 - by two but that's not going to work so
04:04 - I'm picking now an amount of space now I
04:08 - want to pick where that amount of space
04:10 - is so let's say I pick 30 pixels and
04:14 - then I pick it should be centered around
04:16 - you know pixel forty so what I want is
04:21 - to go from pixel forty 15 pixels up and
04:24 - my first rectangle as a height
04:27 - of what it has a height of 40 - you know
04:33 - 30 divided by 2 right and then the
04:36 - bottom rectangle has what it has a
04:40 - height of the the difference between 40
04:46 - right 40 plus the the actual sorry
04:54 - height of the whole window - the center
05:00 - plus whatever that spacing is so if we
05:04 - have sort of figuring that if I come
05:06 - back here I should be saying something
05:08 - like the height is height minus center -
05:16 - plus spacing / - right so how does that
05:22 - that should give me now the the height
05:25 - of the top is from zero to wherever that
05:29 - Center is - the spacing and then the
05:31 - bottom starts at the bottom going all
05:34 - the way up wherever that Center is but
05:35 - then shifting by that spacing so now
05:38 - what I'm going to do is actually make
05:39 - the spacing always 20 pixels and just
05:42 - have a random height we should see this
05:44 - work so we should see now that the
05:47 - amount of space should always be 20
05:48 - pixels now it didn't work when the
05:51 - center point was actually picked too
05:54 - high so I don't know if I can force that
05:57 - to happen again but let's say I pick the
05:59 - center point at 15 pixels we have to fix
06:03 - this if I pick the center point at 15
06:06 - pixels actually it is working so what if
06:08 - I pick the center point at 5 pixels yeah
06:12 - you can see or 1 pixel now it's sort of
06:16 - broken so one thing I have to do is I
06:18 - have to limit where I pick that center
06:21 - point based on how much spacing there is
06:24 - so maybe the center should be picked
06:28 - between spacing and height minus spacing
06:33 - so now we should see I should you know
06:36 - uh you know I could add a lot more pipes
06:38 - like where am I how often am i adding
06:40 - the pipes
06:40 - just a sort of test I add pipes if one
06:45 - goes off the screen and then the pipe
06:48 - moves at a certain speed I guess that's
06:50 - what's controlling it so let me just
06:51 - make the pipes move faster oh that
06:54 - doesn't help maybe if they move slower
06:55 - whatever I tell just how I make that -
06:58 - ah I you know I could I should add pipes
07:01 - in a different way I could just add them
07:02 - every so often but um so but now I
07:05 - should be able to add a random spacing
07:07 - I'm pretty confident that it's working
07:09 - and we could we could make the game kind
07:11 - of hard oops and I'm gonna have a random
07:18 - amount of space okay so now we've
07:20 - improved this game by changing the way
07:22 - the pipes are built and they look design
07:25 - wise they don't look very good so it
07:28 - might make sense for me by the way just
07:30 - somebody in the chat had asked for me to
07:32 - make them a little wider why not right
07:34 - okay so now we could see they're a
07:36 - little bit wider and this is much too
07:38 - hard for me to play but obviously this
07:40 - is stuff that I can do make various
07:43 - design decisions about by just changing
07:45 - I'll make the spacing a little bit
07:47 - easier so let's make the game a little
07:48 - bit easier to play let me make sure it's
07:50 - like vaguely playable for me I not I
07:54 - should add a score and some sound
07:56 - effects and all that sort of stuff but
07:57 - right now let's what I really want to do
08:00 - in this video boy if we wait too long to
08:01 - get to this is what I want to do is what
08:07 - I want to do is change the interaction
08:08 - so I'm reading the chat would have
08:09 - changed the interaction so that when I
08:12 - clap
08:13 - this little flappy circle jumps okay so
08:16 - what do I need to do first I need to
08:18 - make sure that I've got a reference to
08:20 - p5 sound which I do now what I want to
08:23 - do is I want to create I'm going to
08:25 - create an object called mic and I want
08:28 - to say mic equals new p5 audio in so I
08:33 - want an audio in object now what I want
08:38 - to do is say var volume equals mic get
08:43 - level now I think what would be useful
08:47 - is to be able to visually also see what
08:50 - the current level is so one thing I'm
08:52 - going to do is
08:53 - I'm gonna at the end of draw here I'm
08:55 - going to draw a little bar so let me say
08:59 - fill green let me draw a rectangle let
09:03 - me first say why is map the volume which
09:09 - goes between zero and one to some value
09:12 - between height and sorry about between
09:16 - height and zero and then I'm going to
09:19 - draw a rectangle at the edge of the
09:21 - screen which is like with minus 50 we're
09:25 - at Y with the height with a width of 50
09:28 - and a height of height minus y so I just
09:32 - want to add something really quickly and
09:34 - I have a syntax error line 63 somehow I
09:39 - got an extra bracket in there
09:41 - oh oh oh p5 audio in I'm importing I'm
09:48 - not importing sound so one thing you've
09:50 - got to make sure is that I'm using the
09:51 - p5 sound library which is hopefully
09:54 - there in the libraries folder it is okay
09:57 - so why am I not seeing my nice little
10:02 - rectangle let me make sure the volume is
10:06 - working oh I'm just getting 0 so how
10:11 - come I've oh I didn't say start ah
10:13 - always cannot forget cannot forget Mike
10:17 - dot start I've got to start listening
10:19 - and now I'm listening okay so we can see
10:23 - here I just wanted to have that there
10:25 - because I want to be able to visually
10:27 - see what happens when I clap so now what
10:34 - I need to do is make the bird jump when
10:37 - I clap and there's a lot of console
10:39 - logging going on so let me look at this
10:41 - that's fine have that there let me take
10:44 - out the console logging the volume and
10:50 - whoops
10:54 - okay so and I can there's some console
10:57 - logging in this pipe that I can take
10:59 - back out now okay so here we go let's
11:01 - make this really work everybody
11:03 - so the first step that I might do is for
11:05 - they got a look this is all I need when
11:07 - the key and I hit the spacebar bird goes
11:10 - up so on the one hand I could just say
11:12 - like hey if volume is greater than 0.2
11:15 - bird up so let's run that and see what
11:22 - happens
11:26 - so already it's working the thing is
11:29 - first of all if I talk already it's
11:32 - working the thing is it's responding
11:33 - almost a little bit too well so hey
11:36 - there's a lot of sort of threshold
11:39 - appropriate threshold so I should make a
11:41 - slide let's make a slider here to
11:43 - calibrate this so I'm going to say a
11:47 - slider equals create slider between zero
11:51 - the range is between zero and one
11:53 - starting at point two and with a sink
11:57 - remount of 0.01 and so let's just make
12:01 - sure there's a slider here where's this
12:04 - create slider oh there it is so I can
12:07 - use this slider to adjust what will
12:10 - hopefully be a threshold then I want to
12:12 - draw that threshold so I want to take I
12:15 - want to save our threshold equals what
12:19 - do I want to say here I want to get the
12:21 - value of the slider and then I also want
12:26 - another Y value price I'm going to say
12:29 - ty4 threshold Y which is map that
12:32 - threshold between which goes between
12:36 - zero and one from height to zero and
12:38 - then what I want to do is I want to say
12:41 - a stroke let's make it red and I want to
12:45 - us a stroke weight just so we can really
12:47 - see it for then I want to draw a line at
12:50 - from with minus 50 at that threshold to
12:55 - the width at that threshold so I want to
12:59 - be able to see there's a line right and
13:00 - I want to be able to see that the Thresh
13:03 - I want to be able to like move that
13:04 - threshold so I have a sense of where
13:06 - that threshold is
13:07 - and let's in pipe where I'm drawing the
13:11 - pipe let's say no stroke and in bird
13:16 - where I'm drawing the bird also let's
13:20 - say no stroke so that stroke is only for
13:24 - the rectangle and I can also say here no
13:31 - stroke okay so we should see now that
13:34 - I'm able I want to like calibrate this
13:37 - threshold so that's one thing that I
13:39 - want to do so now what I'm saying is
13:40 - when bird when volume is not greater
13:43 - than 0.2 I'm saying when volume is
13:45 - greater than threshold so now let's run
13:53 - this again so now you can see whenever
13:55 - the volume goes above that threshold it
13:58 - actually it moves it up so I can make
14:00 - the threshold higher so now I have to be
14:03 - much louder
14:05 - those were some loud claps I hope I
14:08 - haven't hurt anybody's ears so but
14:14 - here's the thing I actually this is even
14:16 - though the having controlling this
14:17 - threshold is really useful this is not
14:19 - exactly what I want to do to determine
14:23 - if I'm clapping right whenever I talk or
14:26 - make a sound the volume gets louder a
14:28 - clap though is an instantaneous sound
14:31 - but even as slowly as on my clap it's
14:34 - actually loud louder than the threshold
14:37 - for quite a bit of time several frames
14:40 - of animation so that up force is applied
14:42 - many many many times what I actually
14:45 - want to do is have a double threshold
14:46 - I want a threshold for how loud a clap
14:50 - is but I'd only want to trigger the up
14:52 - force once and I don't want to trigger
14:55 - it again until it's become quiet and
14:57 - then loud again so what I actually need
14:59 - are two thresholds so I'm going to make
15:02 - slider top and slider hit bottom so I'm
15:09 - going to say slider top and I'm going to
15:11 - make another one
15:12 - slider bottom these are both sort of and
15:18 - I'm going to have the top threshold
15:19 - start at point three in the bottom four
15:21 - shoulde start at point one and this is a
15:25 - sorry this is slider top threshold top
15:30 - and I need threshold bottom bottom
15:34 - bottom slider bottom so if the volume is
15:39 - greater than the top threshold bird goes
15:41 - up and not clapping so what I want to
15:47 - also do is introduce a new variable
15:49 - clapping and clapping starts at false so
15:52 - I assume I'm not clapping so I only want
15:54 - to trigger the force if I'm not clapping
15:56 - and the sound has gotten above a certain
15:59 - threshold so if the volume gets above a
16:03 - certain threshold and I'm not clapping
16:05 - trigger that force and set clapping
16:08 - equal to true now if the volume ever
16:12 - gets below the bottom threshold now I
16:16 - can set clapping equal to false right so
16:19 - I can only trigger that force when I'm
16:23 - above the threshold so let's also let's
16:26 - also this is top Y and I want to do a
16:32 - bottom Y it this is threshold top a
16:37 - threshold bottom and let's make this one
16:39 - blue and bottom Y bottom Y so I should
16:45 - see now two thresholds so the Thresh the
16:48 - top threshold and the bottom threshold
16:51 - and I pick some arbitrary numbers let's
16:52 - see how they work so I think I need to
16:56 - move the top threshold down a little bit
16:59 - and let's move the bottom threshold down
17:01 - a little bit too so you can see there's
17:13 - like a lot of calibration involved here
17:15 - but but the ID idea is working and so
17:19 - I'm even going to make the top threshold
17:21 - lower and now we're going to see how
17:32 - I'm pretty terrible at this game I could
17:35 - also just do it with talking right so
17:37 - talk talk talk talk jump jump jump jump
17:40 - jump jump jump jump jump jump jump okay
17:42 - by the way I could just use the space
17:44 - but so also you know the strength of the
17:46 - force is quite important various other
17:48 - things are important so anyway I would
17:50 - love for people to take this code and
17:52 - you know hey you know come up with your
17:54 - own game
17:55 - think of a slightly different
17:56 - interaction besides clap play with the
17:58 - threshold values and and sort of see
18:01 - what you get I'm sure that you can
18:03 - improve on and improve of the design of
18:05 - the page where these sliders add labels
18:07 - to the sliders let's think people know
18:09 - what's going on I would love for you if
18:10 - you've watched this video and you take a
18:12 - look at the code that I'm going to
18:12 - publish with it if you make a version of
18:14 - this that's an improvement on what I've
18:15 - done I would love to hear about it so
18:17 - share it in the comments or share it on
18:19 - Twitter at Schiffman and I'll see you in
18:21 - a future video thanks for watching
18:22 - clapping bird
