01:59 - me now
02:01 - and i am just about to begin um there's
02:04 - probably a loud hum
02:05 - because it's very hot to have a fan
02:07 - going

04:03 - hello happy coding train
04:07 - live stream day
04:11 - it is me your host daniel shiffman
04:14 - with very very dirty glasses let me see
04:17 - if i can clean these it's very unlikely
04:19 - that
04:20 - this is going to do any good
04:23 - it's a miracle that i am here
04:26 - broadcasting to you live at this very
04:28 - moment
04:29 - it's a miracle if this is actually
04:30 - working and you are hearing and seeing
04:32 - me
04:34 - um i'm checking out the discord chat
04:38 - uh simon says i don't even hear the fan
04:41 - that's
04:42 - good news um and in the youtube chat
04:46 - i see frank says hello and dara zee
04:49 - says hello and radesh says hello and
04:52 - alex
04:53 - says hello okay
04:57 - um i i was in a panic for like the last
04:59 - uh 20 minutes trying to get this uh
05:01 - stream together i've upgraded my laptop
05:04 - which is right here
05:05 - uh my monitor is over here which is why
05:07 - i keep looking over here unfortunately
05:08 - my arm is cut off because my layout is
05:10 - all wonky
05:15 - i'm in a transition phase for the coding
05:17 - train and i have some
05:18 - announcements and information to impart
05:22 - um and um
05:26 - i also have some work to do on today's
05:29 - live stream
05:30 - which is very important and involves
05:33 - coding
05:34 - let me briefly before i forget
05:37 - um come over here and say
05:40 - a thank you too and i totally messed
05:42 - this up
05:44 - today's sponsor brilliant brilliant is a
05:47 - website and
05:48 - app um one of the things i'm gonna come
05:50 - and look at some of their new lessons
05:52 - there's a new
05:52 - there's a redesign of their course
05:54 - algorithm fundamentals which is really
05:55 - exciting and i want to try some of it
05:57 - but what they're really emphasizing and
05:59 - have done a lot of redesign of their
06:00 - courses is interactivity
06:02 - and interactive lessons it's really fun
06:04 - you know i don't have my um
06:06 - uh mug that i usually like to use my
06:08 - geometry mug that you like to use to
06:10 - demonstrate
06:10 - static learning versus interactive
06:12 - learning this is a brooklyn
06:14 - cyclones mug the minor league team here
06:17 - in the coney
06:18 - plays out of coney island um
06:21 - but you can sign up for free check out
06:23 - brilliant brilliant.org
06:25 - codingtrain um you can sign up for free
06:27 - if you want to unlock all of the courses
06:29 - i'm going to show you some of them later
06:31 - the first 200 people to sign up through
06:33 - that link will get
06:34 - 20 off all right so
06:37 - what are my announcements i really meant
06:39 - to make a list so i'm just going to have
06:41 - to rely
06:42 - on my own memory and widths which
06:46 - has not been very reliable if i'm being
06:48 - perfectly frank
06:49 - these days um but i have some things to
06:52 - discuss
06:53 - number one
06:56 - i think if i come back here um
07:00 - i have to press this button manually
07:02 - because i've messed up my stream deck
07:05 - where all my buttons work number one
07:09 - are you familiar with the coding train
07:11 - website
07:13 - it's where i collect all of the content
07:15 - that i have created over the years
07:18 - on the coding train youtube channel it
07:20 - is categorized into various
07:22 - uh a navigation bar one of the things
07:25 - that's super important to me
07:27 - is to have this beginners tab where you
07:29 - can see like these are three
07:31 - uh tutorial sequences that you can start
07:34 - with with
07:35 - no experience whatsoever for total
07:37 - beginners there's a bunch of things
07:39 - organized here under learning there are
07:40 - the coding challenges which tend to be
07:43 - the more sort of popular videos of mine
07:45 - where i work on an individual project
07:47 - this website is undergoing a complete
07:50 - and total redesign
07:52 - and i am looking for you the viewer of
07:56 - the coding train to help with this
07:57 - redesign
07:58 - in fact we're looking for a few
08:00 - volunteers to do some alpha
08:02 - or beta testing and month on says it's
08:05 - the best website ever
08:07 - oh boy it's gonna get so much better
08:11 - um but i'm looking for um some
08:13 - volunteers in particular
08:14 - with a range like somebody who's totally
08:16 - new to coding maybe new to the coding
08:18 - train somebody who's maybe been
08:20 - watching the videos for years and maybe
08:22 - has a um
08:23 - a lot of experience coding anyway i'll
08:26 - be doing this recruiting if you want to
08:28 - participate
08:29 - in the sort of testing and feedback for
08:31 - the new website design
08:33 - in discord um
08:36 - so what's discord you ask um
08:40 - let me just switch over to this camera
08:43 - um and
08:48 - um i'm over here and i'm switching now
08:51 - to
08:52 - here um and
08:55 - aha okay so let me make this a little
08:58 - bit bigger before i show it to you
09:02 - and close this okay
09:05 - now this is discord it is a chat
09:09 - um system that you you're likely
09:11 - familiar with if you spend any time
09:14 - in participating in online communities
09:16 - started discord started i believe
09:18 - my understanding for gaming communities
09:21 - but
09:22 - um you know i'm a member of different
09:23 - discords for some podcasts i listen to
09:25 - and there's a coding train discord
09:27 - there's a uh ml5.js discord
09:30 - anyway uh this us join the discord
09:33 - uh follow the instructions in the readme
09:36 - um
09:37 - sign up for getting the notifications
09:40 - role and soon um kobe who is our discord
09:43 - manager the coding trained discord
09:45 - manager i haven't actually let kobe know
09:47 - about this
09:48 - email is forthcoming later today we'll
09:50 - be making some announcements for how you
09:52 - can get involved
09:52 - in helping with the new website design
09:57 - okay so i wanted to make that
09:58 - announcement the goal is to have the new
09:59 - website by
10:00 - the end of the summer i've the other
10:03 - thing i want to talk about and this you
10:05 - might not realize this i don't even know
10:06 - if i realized this
10:07 - this is something of a bit of a
10:09 - momentous occasion
10:11 - joseph asked me here in the chat are you
10:13 - in new york city now
10:15 - i saw some pretty scary videos of the
10:16 - hurricane hope everything's okay
10:18 - so thank you joseph i am fine i am in
10:20 - new york city i'm in brooklyn
10:22 - um the hurricane which was by the time
10:24 - it sort of
10:25 - uh uh wafted over the city was
10:28 - i think downgraded to a tropical storm
10:31 - um it
10:32 - um it hit around like 5 a.m this morning
10:34 - i was sleeping i sort of woke up it was
10:36 - actually quite nice to have the sound of
10:37 - the rain because it wasn't that
10:39 - extreme of a storm at least from what i
10:40 - could tell um
10:42 - and everything seems fine here there was
10:44 - quite a bit of flooding but i didn't
10:46 - i didn't really experience that where i
10:47 - am and i i hadn't really been going
10:49 - anywhere other than in my immediate
10:50 - neighborhood
10:51 - so but i uh brought i have been i think
10:53 - for about the last
10:55 - year i can't remember when i moved into
10:57 - the attic
10:59 - in an attic if i if i um
11:03 - let's see let's see if i can get this to
11:04 - work hold on a second i'm going to show
11:06 - you
11:07 - what's going on and why i'm a little sad
11:10 - to report that there might be
11:12 - some light um let's see if this works
11:17 - elgato camera what's it called the epoc
11:20 - cam
11:21 - uh let me see if i can add that add
11:24 - a video capture device add existing epoc
11:29 - cam there we go okay
11:32 - hi so now i'm just live streaming from
11:34 - my phone
11:35 - and i'm going to give you a little
11:36 - behind the scenes look here
11:39 - let's see if i can flip this over and in
11:42 - fact
11:42 - um uh okay let me put this down for a
11:45 - second this is my stream deck that i was
11:47 - fighting with uh there's no reason for
11:49 - you to have to uh okay hold on ah
11:52 - what could what do i do here this is
11:54 - impossible okay
11:55 - there here's a little scene for you this
11:58 - is
11:58 - live producing the show as i am
12:01 - recording the show
12:03 - uh here we go let me move this over to
12:04 - the side this is
12:06 - me here where am i um i am
12:10 - uh this should go down i guess
12:13 - so it's behind me at some point it'll
12:15 - get behind me there we go
12:17 - so now i'm in front of it i don't know i
12:19 - don't know how i feel about this let's
12:20 - move this over here better better much
12:22 - better okay
12:23 - so oh but now i can't point to it i'm
12:26 - really obsessed with it all right it's
12:27 - fine
12:28 - uh all right so what you're seeing here
12:30 - is my uh console which has discord open
12:33 - uh the youtube chat uh open broadcast
12:35 - studio there's my random number book
12:38 - um i sort of keep track of uh like some
12:40 - stats on youtube like you see there's
12:42 - 174 people watching my numbers have been
12:44 - way down by the way
12:45 - which i i you know i think is mostly the
12:47 - fact that i'm completely inconsistent in
12:49 - my
12:50 - schedule and content here's my laptop
12:53 - over here but i was going to show you
12:55 - very quickly you can see this giant pile
12:56 - of boxes
12:57 - also some lego that i need to get
12:59 - working on
13:00 - over here i am moving and
13:03 - um it is not necessarily a permanent
13:06 - move
13:08 - uh but it is um it involves
13:12 - not being in this attic anymore for the
13:14 - time being
13:15 - i think this is my last stream from this
13:17 - attic so i'm
13:19 - attempting to move uh and broadcast
13:22 - from uh a different location which i
13:24 - will talk about in the future once
13:26 - it's sort of set up but i am um going to
13:29 - try to broadcast from a garage
13:31 - up in upstate uh further upstate in new
13:33 - york it's probably gonna take me several
13:35 - weeks to get that set up
13:37 - so i have a lot of content still that
13:39 - i'm working on in terms of video
13:40 - tutorials and things that will come out
13:41 - i don't know why i still got this camera
13:43 - here
13:44 - um and i will be back to brooklyn also
13:48 - at some point uh in the in the nearest
13:51 - future i think
13:52 - it's all very complicated if you wanna i
13:54 - i maybe this could be like a member
13:56 - bonus i can
13:57 - i can do a member q a in the discord
14:00 - about my complicated life planning for
14:03 - the next year
14:04 - but it's just all very unsettled and
14:06 - it's a puzzle and the schedule is off so
14:07 - i i have to apologize in advance for
14:12 - what will probably be a period of no
14:14 - live streams
14:16 - however if all goes according to plan
14:18 - and i've said this before and with
14:20 - various moves and changes i've been
14:22 - shuffling around over the last few years
14:24 - but
14:25 - if all goes according to plan i'm gonna
14:27 - have a very large space
14:30 - with new equipment i mean a lot of the
14:32 - existing equipment but i'm also going to
14:33 - get some new equipment
14:35 - um and hopefully be able to
14:38 - have a more a better experience for you
14:42 - of both video tutorials that are
14:44 - published on the coding train as well as
14:47 - regular live stream events my holy grail
14:50 - what i am trying to achieve
14:53 - and gareth asks is that a millennium
14:55 - falcon
14:56 - wait um was that the lego you're asking
14:58 - about
15:00 - oh no it is the death star
15:03 - it's lego 75159 the death star
15:07 - um
15:10 - uh and um i have other questions to
15:13 - answer here these are good questions
15:14 - from abe
15:15 - and david i will get to those questions
15:17 - um
15:20 - my my goal my holy grail is to have
15:23 - a regular weekly time
15:27 - with an organized structured schedule
15:30 - for my live streams and we're gonna see
15:33 - if i can make that happen i have a
15:35 - feeling there's a good chance i'm gonna
15:36 - be able to make that happen starting
15:38 - january 2022 but if i can make that
15:40 - happen starting in september 2021 i will
15:42 - be very happy
15:44 - uh abe asks why do i always wear the
15:46 - same hat well first of all i really need
15:47 - to get a new
15:48 - orioles hat this is a baltimore orioles
15:50 - i grew up in baltimore
15:52 - as a kid going to see the orioles play
15:54 - at memorial stadium
15:56 - i like to call that i like to call
15:57 - camden yards in baltimore the new
15:59 - stadium
16:00 - and recently even a few years ago
16:03 - someone pointed out it's not really the
16:04 - new stadium because it's been there for
16:06 - over 20 years but when i was a kid i was
16:08 - a big baseball fan
16:09 - multiple orioles were my team they're
16:11 - still my team i wear their hat i like
16:12 - the color
16:13 - i like the cartoon character i like
16:15 - everything about it
16:16 - um so that's why i wear this hat
16:21 - oh i did pronounce ah by uh i
16:24 - i'm not good i'm so i i apologize it's
16:27 - very important to me to learn to
16:29 - pronounce people's names correctly
16:30 - i feel like it's uh um it's it's
16:34 - i don't know rude or i was disrespectful
16:37 - it's it's not very nice to like
16:38 - mispronounce people's names especially
16:40 - if you've been corrected and
16:41 - i try to really like learn my students
16:43 - names and my nyu courses and pronounce
16:44 - their names correctly
16:46 - and i really struggle with it and i got
16:48 - it wrong again so if i could get a
16:49 - reminder
16:51 - in the chat with the phonetic spelling
16:53 - uh
16:54 - mark boots says we'll see which is right
16:56 - um
16:57 - ah so david says so i know you're having
16:59 - external people upgrade the site but
17:01 - will it be open source
17:02 - eventually so david i let's be
17:06 - so the idea is for the site to remain
17:08 - open source
17:09 - and for it to continue to be a community
17:12 - maintained uh website um
17:16 - and actually um david we can talk about
17:19 - this um ah bye
17:20 - thank you ah bye bye thank you
17:23 - abbay abbay is who asked about the hat
17:27 - um but david let's uh chat let's have a
17:29 - chat about it because i would love to
17:30 - loop you into more of the stuff because
17:32 - i know you've been such a
17:34 - kind and generous contributor to the
17:35 - coding train um adriel
17:37 - oliveira is in the chat uh adriel is a
17:40 - member of the coding train i see mark
17:42 - boots
17:43 - um if anybody who uh is a member who
17:46 - hasn't gotten their
17:48 - stickers uh the train whistles are
17:50 - there's gonna be lots more to come about
17:52 - that boy am i just a broken record about
17:54 - the things that are to come
17:55 - they really are they really it's really
17:57 - happening and the progress is happening
17:59 - every
18:00 - week make sure that you're in touch that
18:03 - you filled out the google form and that
18:05 - you're in the discord
18:06 - member's channel if you haven't
18:09 - okay um peter says thank you for
18:12 - everything you share since all these
18:14 - years
18:15 - amazingly um thank you peter i'm
18:18 - wondering it's very unlikely but i met a
18:20 - viewer in
18:21 - uh i was getting my car serviced
18:24 - actually the air conditioning wasn't
18:25 - working i had to get it repaired
18:27 - and i met somebody in the waiting area
18:29 - at the uh at the car
18:31 - repair place who said oh i watch your
18:34 - videos and that was kind of amazing
18:36 - um all right so
18:40 - core asks would you want to go into p5
18:42 - plus bluetooth
18:44 - like the arduino um there is a um a
18:47 - bluetooth library for p5 i would
18:48 - recommend that you check it out maybe i
18:50 - can pull that up and take a look at it
18:51 - alright so what
18:52 - i'm trying to think if there's any other
18:54 - um
18:57 - um news um mark uh why don't you uh
19:00 - hopefully somebody can help you with
19:01 - that but just um
19:02 - tag me in a message after the stream is
19:04 - over and i will help onboard you with
19:06 - the google form
19:07 - craig asks any coding in this video yes
19:11 - so um i have been
19:14 - slowly but surely working on and i'm
19:17 - going to pull it up right here whoops
19:21 - if you've been watching any of my
19:25 - videos as of late if i go to
19:29 - the coding train on youtube and i go
19:33 - here to
19:34 - videos you'll probably see that what's
19:37 - been
19:38 - released most recently are 5.1
19:42 - autonomous steering agents in
19:44 - introduction
19:46 - 5.2 seeking a target
19:49 - and 5.3 flee pursue and evade
19:53 - the next video to come out is arrive
19:56 - then i have a video that was recorded on
19:59 - the wander steering behavior
20:01 - and a video that uh was recorded on path
20:05 - following
20:06 - so i i i make reference to this
20:09 - incessantly
20:10 - but this quest that i'm on uh to
20:13 - complete
20:14 - a p5.js version of every single one of
20:17 - these steering behaviors and
20:18 - to stay as faithful as i can
20:21 - to the original implementation of these
20:24 - steering behaviors now
20:26 - what i want to show you that's very
20:27 - exciting and it's going to take me a
20:28 - minute to get this
20:29 - up and running here uh great i'm already
20:33 - here
20:33 - is that i have
20:40 - yeah um i was able to get
20:43 - an older version of java working and
20:45 - running on my computer so
20:48 - that i can run the original craig
20:50 - reynolds applets now i wonder what year
20:52 - these were
20:53 - created the paper was published i
20:55 - believe in 99
20:57 - 1999 um
21:00 - i hadn't even really like no i
21:03 - i didn't know anything about coding then
21:05 - really at all i mean maybe i'd done a
21:06 - little bit here and there
21:07 - uh i was an adult i'm
21:11 - apparently quite old to be on youtube
21:14 - live streaming
21:15 - although i i hope to be doing this for
21:17 - the long haul i'm not going anywhere
21:18 - people this is this is my life's work i
21:20 - don't you know i keep thinking like
21:22 - what do i what what do i want to do with
21:24 - my life as
21:25 - a 47 year old human who's 48 year old
21:28 - 48th birthday is coming up by the way in
21:30 - 20 days
21:30 - not that i'm asking anybody to get me
21:32 - anything or wish me a happy birthday
21:34 - just noting that
21:35 - you know in case anybody wants to keep
21:36 - track
21:38 - um so what was i talking about ah so um
21:41 - i'm really you know one of my passions
21:44 - um
21:44 - is uh kind of computer graphics history
21:48 - um it's why i like to focus on kind of
21:50 - topics like perlin noise
21:52 - uh particle systems and looking at the
21:54 - origins and early implementations of
21:56 - some of these uh
21:58 - algorithms and techniques that we take
22:00 - for granted and steering behaviors to me
22:02 - is probably
22:04 - um you know where i you know learning to
22:06 - to program steering behaviors is
22:08 - probably where i really like fell in
22:09 - love with creative coding um anyway so
22:13 - um so you know i have a whole chapter on
22:16 - this in the nature of code book i
22:17 - implemented a bunch in processing i'm
22:19 - redoing them i'm updating what i have
22:20 - learned what i have really learned
22:24 - is that a lot of the assumptions that i
22:27 - made
22:28 - even by even reading the paper and
22:31 - trying to follow it and make
22:33 - um and make um
22:37 - what was i saying i lost my train of
22:39 - thought haha because i'm also reading
22:41 - the chat while i'm speaking which no one
22:43 - should ever do
22:46 - um completely forgot what i'm saying but
22:49 - i'm talking about steering behaviors
22:51 - oh um you know i i i
22:54 - um i diverged
22:57 - from quite a few of the uh techniques
23:02 - i diverged and altered my
23:05 - implementations
23:06 - away from some of the the way it's
23:08 - described in craig reynolds original
23:10 - paper
23:11 - so um and some things i did that you
23:14 - could you know perhaps make an argument
23:16 - as an improvement
23:17 - or a kind of way to simplify the
23:20 - algorithm
23:21 - to make it more approachable but some
23:23 - you could also argue are like
23:25 - kind of egregious mistakes and
23:28 - this last video that i published flee
23:32 - pursue and evade uh pursue is fine but
23:36 - the way that i implemented flee
23:37 - and evade was quite off base and one of
23:40 - the things that i really
23:41 - am trying to do more on the live stream
23:44 - is address
23:45 - feedback and comments who's whose
23:47 - birthday is it today
23:49 - fox the bomb oh your birthday was
23:50 - yesterday
23:52 - um um
23:55 - ronald writes i've been working on craig
23:57 - reynolds boyd simulation vanilla js oh
23:59 - that's cool i would love to
24:01 - uh follow your work there um
24:05 - so and i meant to a practice that i want
24:08 - to get into
24:09 - is compiling a list of comments that i
24:12 - want to address and respond to
24:14 - uh from recent videos and i did a good
24:16 - job of doing that last live stream
24:18 - and i couldn't get it together for today
24:19 - but i know
24:21 - in fact that there are some excellent
24:23 - comments here and mostly i replied to
24:25 - them i think if i wanted to address them
24:28 - so let's take a look at some of these
24:31 - um how do i find the comments if i zoom
24:34 - in here
24:35 - is it below all this yes okay
24:38 - first of all uh oh mark boots upgraded
24:42 - the membership to conductors
24:46 - mark thank you for upgrading your
24:49 - membership to the coding train to
24:52 - conductors i forget which level that is
24:55 - i think that's the highest level
24:57 - oh my goodness well this means
25:01 - that you will be receiving your very own
25:05 - custom laser etched train whistle with a
25:08 - random walk pattern on it
25:10 - stay tuned we'll chat about in the
25:11 - discord okay
25:13 - uh getting back to these comments um
25:18 - all right getting in early
25:20 - congratulations on finally finishing
25:22 - every steering behavior and happy new
25:24 - year's
25:24 - 2033. okay let's see 2033 how many years
25:28 - from now is that not too far away if i'm
25:30 - being perfectly honest
25:31 - uh will i have completed place your bets
25:34 - now i don't know if you know you can
25:36 - if they're taking what the line is in
25:37 - las vegas at the moment engineer is the
25:39 - highest conductors is great though in
25:40 - the middle
25:41 - i can never remember thank you bye
25:44 - bye um
25:54 - um
25:56 - i'm reading the chat is fascinating and
25:58 - i really shouldn't read it while i'm
25:59 - talking i want to address and
26:01 - participate in the conversation
26:03 - um and brennan says you should check out
26:05 - david fulmer's comment uh
26:07 - hopefully i will we'll see what i get to
26:09 - but um
26:10 - anyway we'll see i don't know what the
26:11 - line is in las vegas while i get to all
26:13 - the behaviors by
26:14 - 2033 place your bets all right that was
26:16 - my uh joke that i was in the middle of
26:18 - that i
26:19 - completely uh botched because i started
26:21 - reading the chat
26:22 - all right so let's look at this first
26:23 - comment from nick combs
26:26 - pursuit should probably check further
26:28 - ahead of the target's velocity based on
26:30 - the distance
26:31 - the longer it takes you to catch up to
26:33 - something the further it will have
26:34 - traveled all right so let's go look at
26:36 - the code
26:37 - and let's um let's see if we can
26:39 - actually make this improvement
26:41 - um so by the way the main topic for
26:44 - today
26:45 - um you know i'll be here for until about
26:47 - 2 p.m eastern hopefully i'll finish a
26:49 - little bit early
26:50 - i have tickets to see black widow later
26:52 - i'm very excited about that hopefully
26:53 - taking the kids
26:54 - we're big marvel fans um in this
26:56 - household
26:58 - um so
27:01 - um i have my issues with marvel i don't
27:04 - we don't need to get into that this is
27:05 - not a
27:06 - this is not uh your uh
27:09 - cinema essay uh youtube channel it never
27:12 - will be but
27:12 - um um but um i'm going here nature of
27:16 - code
27:19 - sleep pursue evade so every uh
27:22 - video on the coding train has a webpage
27:24 - that goes along with it where you can
27:25 - find the video
27:26 - and you can find all the various code
27:28 - examples
27:29 - uh the ones that i code in the video as
27:32 - well as additional
27:33 - exercises that i often refer to or
27:35 - demonstrate
27:36 - and so um let's just look here at the
27:40 - pursue
27:41 - i think i actually want to look at the
27:44 - pursue bouncing ball one
27:46 - to make this point so what this
27:50 - is is it is oops
27:55 - this vehicle is pursuing
27:58 - that uh pink dot and when it reaches the
28:02 - pink
28:02 - dot the pink dot disappears and
28:04 - reappears in another location and the
28:06 - cycle repeats
28:08 - so the target that it is pursuing
28:11 - um let's make a duplicate version of
28:13 - this
28:14 - excuse me um let's call this
28:17 - live i'm just gonna um
28:21 - i don't know what to call this i should
28:23 - whatever
28:24 - uh um live stream variation
28:28 - i'll think of something better later um
28:32 - if i look at the vehicle and i think i
28:33 - would like to see the debug information
28:36 - so let's put that in so
28:39 - and that's uh very hard to see
28:44 - i don't know why i did it that way
28:48 - okay so we can see that what the vehicle
28:51 - is actually pursuing
28:53 - is the target the green dot because the
28:56 - idea of pursuit
28:58 - is what it's seeking it's pursuing the
29:00 - um
29:02 - the pink dot and why does it get stuck
29:04 - on the edge sometime
29:05 - that's another thing i need to fix it's
29:07 - pursuing the pink dot which means it's
29:09 - seeking
29:10 - seeking the green dot which is a
29:12 - predicted future location and the
29:13 - comment
29:16 - is check further ahead
29:19 - based of the target's velocity based on
29:22 - the distance
29:24 - wait this is actually not what i thought
29:26 - this comment was
29:28 - i i i my understanding of this comment i
29:31 - think
29:32 - some other people wrote this as well
29:35 - um and i'm just
29:39 - peeking through the comments to see
29:42 - afraid of the target yes this is what
29:45 - i'm looking for
29:46 - uh tmc posted this pursuit should derive
29:50 - its estimated target position
29:52 - based on the distance the pursuer is
29:54 - from the target oh
29:56 - oh this is even different than what i
29:58 - was saying
29:59 - wow this is so interesting so in my
30:01 - brain what these comments that i was
30:03 - imagining i was going to find were
30:07 - that the uh this the distance
30:12 - the distance of the green dot from the
30:14 - pink dot
30:15 - should be mapped to the speed
30:19 - of the uh the pink dot right
30:22 - if it's moving faster we might want to
30:25 - try to look further ahead to head it off
30:28 - if it's moving slower um we could seek i
30:32 - don't know what i'm saying we is the
30:33 - vehicle could seek
30:34 - more the actual location of the dot
30:38 - so but now also oh boy is
30:41 - coding garden streaming so i uh um
30:44 - i didn't you know i wish that i i had
30:47 - known that and planned better because i
30:49 - definitely don't like to
30:50 - uh conflict with coding garden but let
30:52 - me just give a plug to go to garden on
30:54 - twitch
30:54 - everybody feel free to go watch the
30:56 - coding garden stream
30:57 - uh you really want to that's that's
31:00 - going to be much more productive and
31:01 - useful than this one
31:02 - so i don't know if both comments are the
31:04 - same but there are two things that
31:05 - there's there are several things at play
31:07 - here um
31:09 - one is um the vlog so let's just look at
31:13 - what i was thinking which is
31:15 - what if well first i want to fix this
31:17 - issue where it's getting stuck
31:21 - so the target
31:24 - ah okay this is why the target
31:28 - is reversing its position when it gets
31:31 - to the edge
31:32 - but sometimes with you know a rounding
31:34 - error or whatever
31:35 - it might not make its way all the way
31:36 - back on
31:38 - and um it should
31:41 - um we might have to slide it back to
31:43 - make sure it is
31:47 - exactly at the position it should be so
31:49 - let's make this correction
31:52 - [Music]
31:56 - and then we can do exactly the same
31:59 - but with a y and height
32:03 - and exactly the same but with
32:06 - y
32:10 - and to be consistent i will put the
32:11 - position so
32:13 - this is very long-winded i'm sure this
32:16 - could be
32:16 - consolidated or written in a more
32:18 - elegant way
32:19 - i always am saying that the prediction
32:21 - could also take the bounces into account
32:23 - yeah now
32:24 - that that is far too
32:28 - sophisticated for my little brain to
32:31 - handle right now
32:32 - so one step at a time but fw that is an
32:35 - excellent
32:35 - comment i love that that i would love
32:38 - for somebody to go off
32:39 - and implement and tweet at me at jiffman
32:41 - or like share your own
32:43 - share your own community contribution to
32:45 - this um
32:47 - um if you implement that where it can
32:48 - actually like predict the bounces oh i
32:50 - would love to see that that's really a
32:51 - cool idea
32:53 - um so uh every time it hits the edge in
32:57 - addition to reversing its velocity
32:59 - it also um
33:03 - it also makes sure that it doesn't move
33:06 - past the edge
33:07 - so that should fix that issue um all
33:10 - right so
33:11 - now what i wanted to do was map
33:14 - a couple things one let's see how crazy
33:17 - we can get about this
33:19 - so in where is the pursue
33:24 - function here it is so right now
33:27 - this is this number 12
33:30 - is just hard coded so that is the look
33:33 - ahead value
33:35 - like for example if i say let look ahead
33:39 - equal
33:39 - 12 let's make it equal to 50 and then i
33:42 - put it in here
33:44 - we can see it's looking ahead 50 pixels
33:46 - now wait that seems
33:48 - way more than 50 pixels
33:52 - oh it is taking in so it's already so
33:55 - first of all
33:57 - way to read your code shiffman uh it is
34:00 - already taking into account
34:02 - the vehicle's velocity
34:06 - because it is not the fixed look ahead
34:09 - it's not a fixed look ahead distance
34:12 - it's a look ahead factor really
34:15 - based on the velocity how how many
34:18 - frames should look ahead so now i'm
34:20 - realizing and maybe i addressed that in
34:22 - the video
34:23 - and i just didn't realize that i did
34:24 - that right so let's put that back to 10.
34:27 - so i'm fine with that i'm keeping that
34:30 - now i think there's another
34:32 - interesting aspect that was um
34:35 - was pointed out and chris is writing
34:37 - this in the chat right now
34:39 - uh green dot location should change
34:42 - based on both the pink velocity and the
34:44 - distance between your vessel and pink
34:48 - thank you chris for putting that so
34:50 - eloquently
34:52 - so let's look at another value here
34:56 - now in the pursuit
35:00 - it's too bad i'm gonna i i wanna what i
35:02 - wanted to say was somewhere in here i'm
35:05 - probably getting that distance
35:07 - but let's just look at it again it's not
35:09 - that much math
35:10 - it's not something for me to really
35:11 - worry about in this case if i had a
35:13 - hundred thousand vehicles and a hundred
35:15 - 000 targets i might start to really need
35:17 - to think about optimizing
35:18 - but i think i'm okay in the clear here
35:22 - so
35:26 - distance is a p5
35:29 - vector.distance between the target
35:35 - and
35:38 - uh i'm so confused oh i'm pursuing the
35:41 - vehicle and this
35:42 - dot position
35:46 - so that is that particular distance
35:51 - so what if i just um
35:55 - actually added that
35:58 - to um oh what if i
36:02 - i have an idea what if i said
36:06 - let so if i said prediction set mag
36:13 - that distance and let's make the look
36:17 - ahead factor one
36:21 - so right now
36:24 - you can see that it's actually kind of
36:25 - cool to watch
36:30 - uh the the chat is saying target.pause
36:33 - but it's actually just the target
36:35 - because the target is already a copy of
36:37 - the vehicle's position
36:39 - but you can see now this is kind of cool
36:41 - i really like this as
36:43 - as it gets closer something's wrong here
36:46 - though
36:50 - i mean it really it really should also
36:52 - have to do with a comparison
36:54 - of i guess that's gym or maybe that's
36:58 - just too much
37:01 - um so what if i
37:06 - then said
37:08 - this was zero point
37:11 - like just 20 percent of that
37:17 - okay that's 50 of that
37:24 - and the problem is when it's behind i
37:26 - guess it's fine when it's behind it
37:28 - because it's going yeah this actually
37:29 - makes sense
37:30 - and then what if i then had a look ahead
37:32 - factor
37:34 - also
37:36 - um or do i want it based on the speed
37:47 - so maybe what i don't want is do i want
37:50 - to multiply it by the
37:51 - i don't know
37:55 - yeah ah a buy was
38:00 - um a buy has a um
38:05 - a great comment which is why did you
38:06 - make the target bounce off the edges why
38:08 - don't you add wrap around
38:09 - yeah this is totally arbitrary i just
38:11 - picked like i was just
38:13 - in the video i'm showing like a bunch of
38:14 - different things you could try
38:16 - and so the bouncing here is definitely
38:18 - creating a bit of an odd behavior
38:21 - um mark writes the green dot represents
38:24 - how far the pink dot can look ahead
38:26 - the pursuer can see much farther that
38:28 - doesn't seem fair
38:31 - interesting yeah so again i i what i'm
38:34 - trying to emphasize here and i think i
38:35 - can i can stop
38:37 - is that there's no right or wrong answer
38:39 - to this question
38:40 - um the idea of these steering behaviors
38:43 - is to creatively design
38:45 - the system according to what you
38:49 - feel makes sense for whatever it is
38:51 - you're building or
38:52 - to just explore a bunch of different
38:54 - ways of trying it so i could try
38:56 - multiplying these things together i
38:57 - could add them together i could take
38:59 - into account a velocity velocity of
39:01 - the of the vehicle of the target you
39:04 - know all sorts of things
39:06 - um all of those things could be great
39:09 - things to add to the look ahead factor
39:11 - but it's interesting to see i just i
39:12 - like this behavior of seeing it
39:14 - kind of like shrink down as the vehicle
39:16 - gets closer
39:17 - okay um let's see i do want to um take a
39:21 - look
39:22 - uh ah oh look at this
39:25 - and right here uh julio
39:30 - [Music]
39:33 - made a community contribution and this
39:35 - is the time on the coding train
39:37 - where i share the versions
39:40 - you made which improve upon and
39:43 - creatively
39:44 - twist the examples in various video
39:46 - tutorials and things that i'm doing here
39:48 - on the channel so
39:49 - i'm so glad that this was submitted
39:52 - let's take a look at it better pursue
39:54 - algorithm prediction
39:56 - based on distance and speed of both
39:58 - target
39:59 - and pursuer it's everything that i was
40:01 - just talking about
40:02 - i hope this link works
40:06 - ah oh my goodness this is wild
40:11 - oh this is so fantastic
40:15 - so we can see here it's really like this
40:19 - very intelligent understanding of when
40:22 - exactly to meet it oh my goodness
40:25 - this is so good oh
40:29 - i thank you internet world of people
40:32 - watching the coding train that i can
40:34 - just plant the seeds and this can flower
40:37 - oh amazing let's take a look at the code
40:40 - um so first of all we can see there's a
40:43 - nice little draw arrow function
40:45 - which is cool to be able to see these
40:46 - things as arrows not just as lines
40:49 - this looks like it's the same uh
40:52 - pretty similar technique to what i'm
40:55 - doing
40:56 - um yep this is all based on the code
40:58 - that i've written so we should be able
41:00 - to
41:01 - just pop down here and look at this okay
41:03 - here we go this is the brilliance
41:05 - right here there's a lot of stuff here
41:07 - i'm going to try to make this
41:09 - wider so we can see the full code okay
41:14 - speed ratio let's try to unpack and
41:16 - understand this
41:18 - ah and and this is a great comment from
41:20 - chris who's talking about we could use
41:21 - an evolutionary technique
41:23 - to optimize uh which is a really really
41:26 - wonderful idea
41:27 - okay speed ratio i'm gonna try to
41:29 - understand this
41:30 - vehicle's uh speed divided by max
41:34 - speed ah okay so how fast is it moving
41:36 - from zero to one according to its
41:38 - maximum speed
41:39 - that's great to always normalize your
41:41 - values so that you it's going to help
41:43 - you tune the parameters
41:45 - such a smart thing oh thank you uh
41:48 - the coding by the way i have now i have
41:51 - resigned from my position as host of the
41:53 - coding train
41:53 - uh julio if i'm pronouncing your name
41:56 - correctly
41:57 - uh um wherever you are uh you're welcome
41:59 - to take over i'm done this is so good
42:02 - uh yeah target angle right this is
42:04 - taking this is what i'm saying is taking
42:06 - into account the angle of the approach
42:08 - the angle between uh
42:11 - the vehicle's position
42:16 - and the target's position wow the
42:18 - pursuers
42:19 - and the targets position then
42:23 - uh take the sine of that
42:27 - angle times the speed ratio and then
42:30 - i'm lost now so i'm going to need help
42:32 - with this one i'm going to need i need a
42:34 - white board which i don't have and i
42:35 - also
42:36 - don't want to get two i'm going to have
42:37 - to i'm going to look at this a little
42:38 - more later
42:39 - maybe somebody um can uh ex
42:43 - uh david please give my regards to uh
42:45 - coding garden
42:46 - um so um
42:51 - what's going on here take the sign of
42:54 - the angle
42:56 - which would be the um
42:59 - value of the adjacent um
43:05 - the length of the adjacent side so
43:08 - that's like the d
43:08 - that's the distance okay that's actually
43:10 - not so bad the distance
43:13 - then um
43:17 - shrink it by the speed ratio and then
43:19 - get the angle back
43:22 - so basically it's oh it's the amount
43:25 - it's like the arc
43:26 - length i actually i i read it i think i
43:28 - understand it
43:29 - um what's a good i i don't i really need
43:31 - a whiteboarding
43:33 - solution for when i'm live streaming my
43:35 - the place where i'm um
43:36 - where i'm moving my studio to i'm gonna
43:38 - have i hope a very good
43:40 - uh diagramming system and i just don't
43:42 - have that right now
43:43 - um i don't know if anybody followed my
43:46 - sort of like talking through me reading
43:48 - this code understanding but i have a
43:49 - picture of
43:50 - what it's like in my head i guess i
43:51 - could
43:53 - hook up a tablet or something and draw
43:54 - with my finger but i'm going to move on
43:56 - then i'm then we get the distance and
43:59 - the prediction is
44:01 - oh now i'm lost again the distance times
44:04 - sine of that angle uh divided by
44:09 - uh sine of my pi minus my angle okay
44:15 - um yeah okay so i now i uh
44:18 - uh i definitely i need my white board i
44:20 - need my diagram but you can see
44:22 - here that what this is doing is it's
44:24 - taking into account
44:26 - multiple factors let's just look at it
44:28 - again
44:30 - because it's really quite beautiful to
44:31 - watch like
44:33 - that distance is not just related to
44:36 - like where it's supposed to seek is not
44:39 - it you know is
44:40 - really relevant like if it is if it is
44:43 - moving
44:43 - uh in parallel to it from behind or in
44:47 - front versus at a perpendicular
44:48 - angle like where it's going to meet it
44:52 - is based on their relative locations
44:55 - uh as well as the speed that they're
44:57 - traveling so and chris sears like
45:00 - uh sine is opposite over hypotenuse yeah
45:02 - why did i say adjacent
45:04 - i don't know why i said to jason because
45:06 - i'm panicking
45:08 - and trying to do math in my head without
45:10 - drawing it while live streaming
45:12 - sorry to get that wrong we'll edit this
45:15 - out of the live stream later
45:16 - dub uh we'll dub this over um yeah chris
45:19 - saying this looks like the law of signs
45:22 - so let's see if we can find a nice
45:23 - diagram of this
45:25 - speaking of why you should subscribe to
45:27 - um
45:29 - oh shoot my button's not working
45:31 - brilliant
45:32 - i have a feeling there's an interactive
45:33 - lesson to help understand this
45:35 - but um the law of sines
45:40 - uh is a sine rule relating the length of
45:42 - sides of triangles to the sines of its
45:44 - angles
45:45 - yeah so uh we can see we i can imagine
45:48 - here that we've got
45:49 - kind of this big triangle where we have
45:51 - the vehicle's location
45:53 - the pursuer's location and we're trying
45:55 - to find
45:56 - and then their velocity vectors right uh
45:59 - we're trying to find
46:00 - what it's where where where the two
46:02 - shall meet
46:04 - the seeking target so that that totally
46:06 - makes this totally makes sense that you
46:07 - would use the law of signs right
46:09 - what if this is where the vehicle is
46:13 - this is where the the target is
46:16 - and the target is moving in this
46:18 - direction well based on its speed
46:20 - uh you know we want to figure out what's
46:22 - the triangle
46:24 - uh that's going to where they would meet
46:26 - and based on its velocity and its
46:28 - velocity and
46:29 - so if it was moving at a certain speed
46:31 - um and the vehicle was moving at a
46:33 - certain speed with a certain steering
46:34 - force
46:34 - we could imagine that this could be the
46:36 - part it would want to steer towards here
46:38 - to meet this vehicle at the moment where
46:40 - it gets down here so it makes a lot of
46:42 - sense that the law of signs
46:44 - would be um happening here and i would
46:46 - love
46:49 - to implement this in a video i kind of
46:51 - almost want to like try to code it
46:52 - myself
46:53 - but i have other things to cover today
46:55 - i'm almost at the halfway point
46:56 - and we have this beautiful wonderful
46:59 - example what a surprise to find this
47:00 - today
47:01 - um a train whistle for giulio
47:05 - a bell for giulio i mean julio should
47:08 - get a random number here
47:10 - for sure for this wonderful uh this
47:13 - random number is in honor
47:16 - this extra special random number is
47:19 - in honor of julio in this amazing
47:22 - contribution
47:23 - to the pursuit uh steering behavior and
47:26 - the random number is
47:28 - on page 211 row 10515
47:33 - column zero one two three and it is
47:39 - thirty four thousand or sorry it's not a
47:42 - number it's a sequence it's a random
47:43 - sequence of five digits
47:44 - three four seven six four there you go
47:47 - wonderful work thank you ah beautiful
47:51 - all right we're moving along now back to
47:54 - uh the comments um
47:58 - all right fixed multiplier we're looking
48:00 - at this now i want to see
48:02 - i want to find the correction that simon
48:04 - pointed out to me
48:07 - and so let's see i'm just going to
48:08 - scroll through these comments here
48:11 - uh so it's about flea
48:15 - i'm pretty sure somebody pointed it out
48:18 - i thought i kai replied to it oh yeah
48:22 - why doesn't he have the target evade the
48:24 - pursuer ah
48:26 - yes why didn't i do that so i'm
48:28 - definitely gonna i'm gonna
48:29 - fix evade and then i'm gonna do that
48:31 - that'll be great
48:32 - let's do that uh
48:36 - okay um
48:39 - i'm looking for the
48:42 - i'm looking for the comment that i'm
48:44 - looking forward i made a really big
48:45 - mistake in
48:46 - flea and evade interesting i don't see
48:50 - the comment
48:52 - uh
48:56 - i'm looking for it
49:00 - by the way this is amazing to me i found
49:02 - your channel through nebula
49:05 - um not not a sponsor for today's uh
49:09 - um uh video um
49:13 - but a sponsor of the coding train
49:18 - wow where does anybody see a comment
49:20 - that has the correction
49:25 - i really don't think anybody would want
49:26 - to listen to a coding train podcast
49:27 - although i appreciate the comment julian
49:30 - uh i don't see it looking at the chat i
49:31 - pointed out i know simon you pointed out
49:33 - in discord
49:34 - but it was brought up i i saw um some
49:39 - youtube comments about it for sure uh ah
49:44 - yes here it is
49:44 - from trevor
49:48 - long time listener first time caller
49:50 - love that
49:51 - love this and you thank you always nice
49:53 - to have an
49:54 - i have a nitpick question i would say
49:56 - not a nitpick this is a pretty
49:57 - significant error
49:59 - and you could see that my reply is even
50:00 - incorrect which i will
50:02 - unfold and show you how i got it wrong
50:04 - in the move
50:05 - from seek to flee and pursue to evade
50:08 - does it matter that it's the steering
50:10 - force that's being negated
50:12 - rather than the desired velocity
50:15 - i don't have the paper in front of me
50:17 - but i feel like the order of operations
50:18 - is not quite correct
50:20 - you're absolutely right
50:24 - so i want to correct this let's fir
50:26 - let's go look at the paper
50:29 - let's see if we can find and confirm
50:33 - and and again i'm sorry that i don't
50:35 - have a diagram maybe i could share
50:36 - simon's diagram which is i will
50:38 - just super helpful i will pull that up
50:41 - in a moment
50:42 - um let's look for flea
50:48 - yeah so look at this
50:52 - actually simon's diagram is like this
50:54 - type so first of all i can even just see
50:55 - right now
50:56 - from the diagram i did it incorrectly
51:01 - and i it it's so uh it upsets me so
51:04 - deeply
51:05 - because it also goes against the sort of
51:08 - core principle that i was emphasizing in
51:10 - these videos
51:11 - where everything is derived from the
51:13 - desired velocity
51:14 - and if you think about it the desired
51:16 - velocity you can't just
51:18 - the desired velocity for fleeing is to
51:20 - move in the opposite direction and what
51:22 - i
51:22 - did is i just took right if this is the
51:26 - desired velocity right
51:28 - this is the current velocity so the
51:31 - seek steering behavior is desired the
51:34 - desired vector
51:35 - minus the velocity vector and you can
51:37 - see that here and that makes sense
51:39 - it's a vector that's going to push this
51:41 - triangle cause it to steer
51:43 - and seek along the path to the target so
51:46 - what i did
51:48 - for flee in a very lazy way is i just
51:51 - said
51:52 - negate that so the steering behavior is
51:54 - this way and
51:55 - in truth it's not so horrible it's
51:58 - definitely going to move
51:59 - away from the target because instead of
52:02 - turning
52:02 - this way it's going to turn this way
52:06 - but in truth um
52:09 - it's it's the actual flee uh steering
52:12 - vapor should be this one
52:14 - because i should be looking at its
52:16 - desired velocity
52:17 - first and then taking desired
52:21 - minus the current velocity which gives
52:22 - this red vector so
52:24 - the steering the flea steering path you
52:26 - can see is this red line
52:27 - my guess if i could if i could draw on
52:30 - it
52:31 - like maybe i could do it with my finger
52:32 - slightly um
52:34 - would be like no i can't because i'm
52:35 - tiny in the chord i have to make myself
52:37 - really big
52:38 - and i don't have an easy way of doing
52:39 - that but i'll just do it with the mouse
52:41 - arrow
52:42 - my guess is that if i do it my way the
52:44 - path would be something
52:46 - like this a mirror image of this path
52:50 - which this is not a mirror image it's a
52:52 - more extreme
52:54 - term
52:58 - and then um brennan is saying this
53:00 - multiple
53:01 - times that um
53:04 - there's a comment from and i uh david
53:07 - fulmer and so i
53:08 - i'm going to go on
53:13 - yes so uh here it is
53:16 - uh let me just heart this um
53:19 - so let's read this comment it's a long
53:21 - one i don't know if i'm
53:22 - i usually don't but let's i believe the
53:24 - argument by trevor sargent is correct
53:26 - the desired velocity not the force
53:28 - should be flipped thank you and it does
53:30 - make a big difference
53:33 - um so uh let's i assume
53:41 - uh upon further investigation
53:45 - during my live stream it is most
53:48 - definitely
53:49 - not the same and this is such an
53:52 - error that i plan to record a separate
53:57 - video about this correction
54:00 - i'll do it on my tick tock i don't have
54:02 - a tick tock there's no tick tock
54:04 - by the way if anybody wants to be hired
54:06 - by the coding train
54:08 - to just make shorts out of my videos you
54:11 - can figure out a way to do that i'm
54:13 - i'm i would be open to that i i keep
54:16 - youtube just sends me a message after
54:17 - message like try our shorts try our
54:18 - shorts try our shorts we're pushing
54:20 - shorts shorts are great you should make
54:21 - shorts make shorts shorts short shorts
54:23 - i don't know i can't do it i can't do it
54:24 - i can't do it um
54:26 - so where where do i have my live stream
54:29 - open let's just put a link to it for
54:31 - future
54:31 - reference um
54:34 - i will get this video url
54:38 - uh if someone
54:41 - can reply with the time code after
54:44 - it's published that would be great
54:50 - okay so i'm replying here and then david
54:54 - uh thank you for this excellent i i i'm
54:58 - i haven't read over the whole thing i'm
55:00 - kind of going on faith here but i
55:01 - conceive
55:02 - uh and actually right now i just jump to
55:06 - the middle it's why i don't like
55:08 - steering behaviors because of how
55:09 - it should be done is so ambiguous that
55:11 - mistakes like this can be made easily so
55:13 - it's interesting i'm gonna flip what you
55:14 - say maybe i'm just like the glasses
55:16 - half full eternal optimist but to me
55:20 - your reasoning is exactly why i love
55:22 - steering behaviors
55:23 - because i you know i am saying this is a
55:26 - mistake and it's a mistaken that i
55:27 - didn't follow reynolds instructions
55:29 - so to speak but i think there's no right
55:31 - or wrong answers here it's about
55:32 - creatively exploring the possibility
55:34 - space
55:35 - uh
55:38 - all right so i'm just replying there
55:40 - that's really terrific
55:41 - um so let's take a look at correcting
55:44 - that right now
55:45 - and let me see if i can pull up simon's
55:46 - diagram which will also
55:50 - be super helpful so i'm just going to go
55:52 - into the discord
55:54 - the reason why i'm just going to my
55:55 - camera here is i don't like to
55:58 - show people's messages without their
56:01 - sort of permission
56:02 - so um i'm just going to open the image
56:08 - and then come back here so this is a
56:10 - diagram that simon
56:11 - made for me which we can see
56:15 - basically if this is the current
56:17 - velocity um
56:18 - and this is the and this should say that
56:21 - these this is the seek
56:22 - desired and this is the flee desire so
56:25 - this is not the seek force
56:26 - this is not the flee force this is the
56:28 - seek desired velocity
56:30 - this is the flee desired velocity then
56:33 - this would this is the seek steering
56:36 - behavior
56:37 - and mine did this red thing which is
56:39 - obviously different
56:41 - than this particular now it looks like
56:43 - it's
56:44 - so extremely different because of the
56:46 - length of this vector
56:47 - but you have to remember that the length
56:50 - is capped at maximum force
56:52 - so most likely it's not going to be as
56:56 - extreme of a difference but it is
56:58 - significant
57:00 - um okay so this is and
57:04 - and k is writing i just wanna it's so
57:06 - lovely that dan replies to comments on
57:07 - his videos i don't know maybe you're
57:08 - referring to me typing the comments
57:10 - but to me this is the greatest discovery
57:12 - ever
57:13 - of being able to use the live streams as
57:16 - reading through and going over and
57:18 - issuing corrections and seeing the the
57:20 - creative um i mean the whole point of
57:22 - what i'm doing
57:23 - is to build a community of people uh
57:25 - making this stuff
57:26 - uh and as you can see i'm not
57:28 - particularly you know
57:30 - i am not the expert or i'm not the
57:33 - the i i i'm trying to even use the the
57:35 - words that i'm trying to say
57:37 - but um i'm not i was just like i i
57:39 - always say i'm not so good at this
57:41 - but i don't want to say that because i
57:42 - don't want you to say that about
57:43 - yourself
57:44 - so so i don't want to model that paper
57:46 - we're all learning and figuring this out
57:48 - um and
57:48 - can't do it on your own it's what i'm
57:50 - trying to emphasize
57:52 - um all right so um let me just go back
57:54 - to here
57:56 - so let's um let me fix this and then
57:58 - i'll take a break
57:59 - i'm just closing um back the discord
58:02 - um
58:06 - if anybody i will post some links here
58:08 - if anybody wants a link to this
58:09 - um diagram i will put that in the i'm
58:13 - in the um so if you're in the discord
58:15 - under live
58:16 - schedule is where i try to keep people
58:18 - updated on the schedule links is where i
58:20 - post links to things
58:21 - because the youtube chat is too
58:22 - ephemeral
58:24 - so simon's
58:28 - simon's diagram
58:32 - and then code uh
58:36 - um playing uh let me just actually put
58:38 - yeah code
58:39 - playing around with pursue prediction
58:43 - uh distance so that was
58:46 - [Music]
58:48 - um
58:50 - oh no this is this is uh julia julio's
58:54 - sorry my watch is calling me
58:59 - uh where is this here we go uh so i'll
59:02 - post this here
59:03 - so people can find it and
59:06 - um this is
59:11 - uh let me go back here this is um
59:14 - [Music]
59:16 - amazing law of sines
59:19 - version okay so those are all there for
59:22 - you in the discord in the live
59:24 - uh in the links channel under the live
59:26 - category uh please come
59:29 - and say hi there all right now
59:32 - what's next so i want to do
59:36 - um i want to
59:39 - eva where was that one evade
59:43 - wait no well i don't remember where the
59:46 - comment is
59:51 - stop calling me um turn on my do not
59:54 - disturb
59:55 - do not disturb on okay um
60:01 - where was the comment
60:04 - about the target
60:14 - uh ah there here we go
60:17 - okay so i'm gonna come back to this why
60:19 - doesn't he have the target
60:21 - evade the pursuer ah that's my reaction
60:23 - upon reading this comment why why didn't
60:25 - i do that why didn't i do that such a
60:27 - good idea
60:28 - let's do that okay so
60:31 - is this the oh this is uh the amazing
60:34 - version
60:36 - well do i dare
60:40 - no this is my verb this is not the
60:41 - amazing version i'll use my crappy
60:43 - version
60:44 - and then i should do it with and i gotta
60:46 - um i'm blocking the code here
60:49 - um i'll do it with my version i should
60:51 - really do it with julia
60:52 - julio's because that would be cool to
60:55 - see
60:57 - um but let's let's just leave it
61:01 - at at this so
61:05 - um all right so i've got a pursuer and
61:07 - i've got a target
61:09 - and just for
61:15 - where is the target class
61:18 - vehicle oh no they're both i didn't use
61:22 - i thought this was where i used um
61:25 - okay i need to go to a vape oh i gotta
61:27 - fix it
61:28 - i'm i'm all turned around uh let's go to
61:32 - uh this page pursue and let's look at
61:36 - evade evade so this is true for both
61:40 - flea
61:41 - and evade oh boy so evade
61:45 - its desired velocity is to move away
61:47 - from the
61:50 - it's future location yeah i don't know
61:54 - oh boy oh this is freaking me out here
61:59 - um i think mine is more realistic
62:03 - yeah uh evading evasion
62:10 - um hi dracula dracula is here
62:15 - i'm a little bit terrified to be honest
62:16 - dracula has a check mark which i read as
62:19 - this is the verified
62:20 - real life dracula in the chat right now
62:33 - [Music]
62:43 - uh let's start with flea
62:46 - i'll be working on wander when i come
62:48 - back for my break
63:02 - flea corrected
63:03 - [Music]
63:08 - so this is flea but
63:19 - [Music]
63:20 - okay so where's fleet i you know i'm
63:23 - realizing why i did this
63:25 - because it was so nice and easy and why
63:28 - is there like a big
63:29 - what's this qr code oh that's like
63:33 - because i had i forgot about my
63:35 - life by polls oh no i'm so disorganized
63:38 - i really do a terrible job at this it's
63:41 - the worst
63:42 - um all right please please please please
63:46 - please please please
63:47 - go away okay uh what's the font size
63:50 - here it looks a little small i guess
63:51 - it'll be fine
63:52 - so you can see here my motivation for
63:55 - doing it this way
63:57 - because i was able to just call seek and
64:00 - multiply it by negative one
64:02 - and now i think what i want to do
64:06 - is the following i'm going to do it the
64:08 - same way i it
64:09 - you haven't seen this yet because i
64:11 - haven't published it but i'm going to
64:13 - use a technique
64:14 - that i implemented with the arrive
64:17 - behavior so i'm going to add
64:21 - a particular
64:25 - a second optional argument with a
64:27 - default
64:28 - value of false
64:32 - so this is the desired velocity the
64:35 - the vector that points between the
64:39 - target and the position
64:40 - at maximum speed
64:44 - if flee
64:47 - force multiply negative one
64:51 - so and and if i'm calling it force the
64:54 - whole way through because that's
64:55 - ultimately what it is
64:56 - but at this moment it's the desired
64:58 - velocity and then
65:00 - i subtract the velocity because i'm
65:02 - trying to use fewer vectors
65:04 - um i think i cover this in the videos
65:06 - and then flee
65:07 - is just return seek the target
65:12 - true so this is now very simple
65:15 - correction
65:16 - but because i want to reuse the seek
65:21 - the seek function and i'm i reuse the
65:23 - seek function for when i do arrive
65:28 - what if i were to do
65:41 - what if i were to do this
65:47 - oh no whoops
65:53 - because i'm realizing when i do arrive i
65:55 - have a second modification
66:02 - hmm
66:05 - right and harry points out which is
66:07 - exactly what i'm trying to emphasize
66:08 - here
66:08 - it depends on what you're going for but
66:10 - i i'm right now i'm trying to think of
66:12 - what's the clearest
66:14 - and least prone to error way i probably
66:17 - should have some kind of like
66:18 - constant and innumerable or something
66:20 - like that
66:22 - that's a coding thing right but we can
66:24 - see here
66:25 - you know it's just obviously moving
66:29 - away from the target in a more extreme
66:31 - way okay great so that fixed that that's
66:33 - flixing
66:34 - fixing flea
66:37 - i don't think julio would mind
66:41 - let's go to i want to see it with
66:45 - this creative version i already
66:48 - um sorry i already have a copy of it
66:51 - so let me open that up this is the
66:58 - pursue
67:02 - um oh maybe i didn't maybe i didn't
67:07 - actually save a copy of it oh
67:10 - and right there in the title it says
67:13 - rule of signs
67:14 - so i know why i couldn't uh see that
67:22 - um
67:26 - oh simon has a really interesting idea
67:29 - why what if you make modification of
67:31 - function itself
67:32 - so i could pass in a function to
67:34 - calculate the desired velocity
67:38 - i do like that so i'm going to um
67:42 - i'm gonna maybe revisit that later
67:43 - because i want to just finish this off
67:46 - okay so now what i'm looking at doing
67:53 - is the target
67:59 - um is there an evade here
68:06 - this is pursue
68:12 - so in theory evade and i'm just going to
68:15 - totally copy paste it
68:18 - evade would be
68:36 - hmm
68:39 - maybe i've bit off more than i can chew
68:41 - here
68:45 - um
68:48 - where is the
68:52 - oh because it's seeking the target
69:03 - all right i gotta look at i gotta look
69:04 - at reynolds paper here
69:09 - please evasion
69:15 - pursuit is a moving character requires a
69:17 - prediction of the target's future
69:18 - position
69:19 - the approach here let me make it so you
69:21 - can see everything i'm reading
69:27 - a linear velocity-based predictor
69:29 - corresponds to the assumption that the
69:30 - quarry will not turn during the
69:32 - prediction interval
69:33 - t units of time in the future scaling
69:36 - velocity by t
69:37 - and adding that offset
69:41 - ideally t would be time until
69:43 - interception but that value is
69:44 - unknowable because the quarry can make
69:46 - arbitrary
69:47 - maneuvers to t should be assumed to be a
69:49 - constant which while naive would
69:51 - produce better pursuit than simple seek
69:54 - for reason whereas t should be larger
69:55 - when the pursuit is far from the choir
69:57 - all this is written in here by the way
69:59 - problem is like i didn't re-read the
70:02 - paper when re-recording these videos
70:04 - which is clearly a mistake here
70:06 - a more sophisticated estimator can be
70:08 - obtained by taking into account the
70:09 - relative headings
70:10 - so this is what julio did um
70:16 - and now evasion is analogous to pursuit
70:20 - except that flea is used to steer away
70:22 - from the predicted future position of
70:24 - the target character
70:26 - optimal techniques for pursuit and
70:28 - invasion exists in the field of control
70:30 - theory
70:31 - it's a reference to another paper
70:33 - versions here are intended to be
70:34 - lightweight and none
70:38 - excuse me non-optimal
70:42 - awesome that's those are my
70:46 - that's my love language lightweight and
70:48 - non-optimal
70:57 - in natural systems evasion is often
71:00 - intentionally non-optimal in order to be
71:02 - unpredictable allowing it to foil
71:03 - predictive pursuit strategies
71:07 - wow there is so much more to this um
71:12 - so
71:19 - i think
71:22 - what i'm going to do oh this actually is
71:24 - no big no biggie
71:27 - because
71:33 - um evade is return
71:37 - seek the target
71:47 - evade
71:51 - and in seek
72:05 - and this should really be a flea i don't
72:08 - like the way i'm doing this at all
72:13 - so let's see here so in theory
72:16 - i now have a a pursue algorithm
72:26 - and a evade algorithm and the only thing
72:30 - difference
72:30 - different is i am reversing the desired
72:33 - velocity
72:34 - not reversing not reversing the final
72:38 - steering behavior itself and so now
72:43 - what have i done here where is canvas
72:51 - then i should be able to go to here
72:54 - and i should be able to see
73:03 - target edges
73:06 - pursuer steering okay then i should be
73:09 - able to say
73:11 - target no target
73:15 - let steering equal target
73:18 - dot evade pursuer
73:23 - target apply force
73:35 - it's called evade force let's call it
73:39 - pursue
73:40 - force
73:45 - i spelled target wrong
73:52 - uh-oh
73:57 - do they immediately like
74:00 - whoa what did i do
74:09 - what happened
74:23 - oh i messed something up
74:28 - what did i do i totally messed up
74:35 - this algorithm
74:42 - wow this is crazy what i did it's kind
74:44 - of interesting
74:45 - i think i'm just going to go back to my
74:46 - own version of it
74:50 - let's go back to my own version um
74:53 - which is
74:57 - evade
75:02 - let me uh correct evade
75:11 - so the correction to flee was
75:17 - uh duplicate
75:22 - evade correction
75:28 - if modification
75:33 - equals flea then
75:36 - force multiply negative one okay
75:39 - so flee is c return this dot seek
75:43 - flee then pursue
75:47 - is pursue the vehicle and
75:50 - evade
76:01 - [Music]
76:04 - um
76:08 - return pursue
76:12 - the vehicle with the
76:16 - with flea
76:29 - so in other words oh and this is this
76:33 - dot pursuit
76:34 - so evade is pursue the vehicle
76:37 - but passing in flea so that when it
76:40 - returns
76:41 - seek it does
76:44 - the the the flea modification
76:47 - and flea is just doing seek with the
76:49 - flea modification
76:52 - so then um yeah so then i should be able
76:56 - to
76:57 - say why is there an error here or a
77:00 - warning duplicate method evade
77:03 - because where did i put evade oh right
77:05 - so instead of doing this
77:09 - this is my corrected evade
77:14 - and let's see what happens here if i run
77:18 - the sketch
77:21 - it's evading it
77:27 - so that's right
77:32 - so pursuer evade
77:35 - but i want pursuer to pursue
77:42 - okay so this is now my unsophisticated
77:45 - pursuer pursuing the target
77:51 - and what i want now is for my target
77:57 - to evade the pursuer
78:05 - why isn't the target
78:09 - moving around oh you know what no
78:20 - oh oh oh of course let
78:24 - evasion
78:27 - target dot apply force i forgot that it
78:29 - doesn't apply the force
78:32 - there we go
78:35 - there we go now it's actually trying to
78:37 - evade it there i love this
78:41 - [Laughter]
78:46 - weird okay wait a sec that was very
78:48 - strange
78:51 - that was very strange
79:00 - oh because of the wrap around
79:04 - because of the wrap around that's why i
79:06 - get into this weird oscillation thing
79:11 - maybe what to make this look better and
79:14 - apologies for my sort of like screen
79:16 - layout here which is all
79:18 - wonky maybe to make this look better
79:22 - i should have the oh the vehicle has a
79:25 - maximum speed of 10.
79:27 - and let's make it a max let's make the
79:29 - vehicle
79:30 - the
79:33 - let's set the maximum speed to 5 for the
79:36 - target
79:38 - yeah so the target is much slower
79:44 - the wrap around is really a problem
79:47 - what if i have them both do the edges
79:49 - thing
79:52 - maybe that'll make it less weird
80:06 - yeah this is kind of this is kind of
80:08 - cool so
80:09 - i i wanted to get rid of the um
80:14 - the debugging because it's kind of
80:17 - distracting
80:18 - it looks interesting but it is
80:20 - distracting
80:25 - and then i also would like
80:32 - them both to be triangles
80:38 - where'd they go so let's see if i can
80:43 - make this full screen
80:50 - oh is it not the um hold on
80:53 - this is i i'm not this is this is where
80:55 - i'm going to stop
80:57 - uh window with window height i would
81:01 - really like to see them as different
81:02 - colors though
81:04 - so um
81:11 - can i do this
81:24 - no this is not going to work because
81:30 - it says the fill there
81:34 - oh yeah i don't know why it did this but
81:37 - it
81:38 - works somehow one's green one's pink
81:42 - i don't fully understand why but i won't
81:45 - question it
81:49 - okay now
81:57 - almost ready to go to a break here
82:01 - uh file share
82:05 - full screen
82:18 - it's still doing that wonky edges thing
82:28 - that there we go finally seeing
82:29 - something kind of interesting
82:38 - so what's a better way of doing this
82:42 - without the
82:42 - um without the edges i guess what i
82:46 - should do is put an edge
82:48 - force so they have to turn around
82:50 - instead of rapping
82:54 - drunk paper airplanes um
82:59 - so i i i really
83:03 - kind of running out of time here i'm way
83:04 - over where i meant to be
83:06 - so i but i would love you let me post a
83:09 - link to this
83:10 - uh particular example
83:13 - um we exit full screen
83:17 - um and um
83:20 - let me paste this into the discord
83:24 - links so what i think would really
83:27 - really
83:27 - improve this um which i would suggest as
83:30 - an exercise to the viewer would be
83:32 - to have a force from the walls that
83:34 - keeps them within the space
83:36 - so instead of being able to like leave
83:38 - and disappear on the other side
83:40 - it has to figure out how to like turn
83:42 - around and go back on and then
83:44 - that might um actually like feel like we
83:47 - have a much more
83:48 - yeah the uh and then simon points out
83:52 - that the answer to this would be
83:54 - containment
83:55 - so uh let's take a look at containment
83:59 - uh this is
84:02 - um we can take a look at reynolds
84:07 - this was where is it
84:13 - why oh there we go um
84:17 - is it called containment here yeah
84:20 - containment.html
84:30 - containment.html let's see what happens
84:32 - here
84:33 - right so this is a really cool steering
84:37 - behaviors
84:38 - that keeps um vehicles contained
84:42 - uh within a space so this is one that i
84:45 - definitely need to do
84:47 - and then if i made the borders uh walls
84:50 - that they were contained in
84:52 - uh adding that to this would be the
84:54 - ultimate
84:55 - uh make a mental note somebody write
84:57 - that down remind me
84:59 - future live stream uh sunny
85:02 - uh go back to work appreciate the nice
85:04 - comment in the chat
85:05 - um i am going to take a minute now
85:08 - to thank today's
85:13 - uh sponsor which is brilliant
85:17 - all right i have some exciting uh
85:19 - information to report about brilliant
85:21 - which is brand new
85:23 - and um you know i have talked a lot
85:27 - many a time about brilliant and about
85:30 - how it helps you to learn
85:32 - uh stem so and the thing that i really
85:34 - try to emphasize which is different
85:36 - about brilliant from what i do
85:37 - on the coding train is the fact that it
85:40 - is try it yourself
85:41 - interactive lessons and uh brilliance is
85:44 - always sending me updates about what
85:45 - they're doing with their platform things
85:46 - that they've expanded new courses that
85:48 - they've updated
85:49 - and their update right over here talks
85:51 - about how
85:52 - interact interactivity is taken to a
85:55 - whole
85:55 - new level so i'm going to show you a
85:57 - clip right now of one of their
85:59 - interactive lessons
86:00 - that is about the pythagorean theorem so
86:03 - you might remember
86:04 - um from any of my videos what the
86:07 - formula for the pythagorean theorem is
86:09 - but the idea of this lesson is that by
86:11 - moving around triangles
86:13 - and actually proving that a squared plus
86:16 - b squared is equal to c
86:17 - squared um just through the
86:19 - interactivity of the lessons and your
86:21 - own manipulation
86:22 - stuff so um brilliant it's a website an
86:25 - app it's active problem solving
86:27 - real time um
86:30 - jump right into solving problems coach
86:32 - bit by bit and
86:33 - you know before you know it you're going
86:34 - to have learned something totally new so
86:35 - the other course
86:37 - that i really want to emphasize and show
86:39 - you
86:40 - is their algorithmic fundamentals course
86:43 - so look at that does that not look like
86:45 - code to you
86:46 - right so you don't need any coding
86:49 - experience
86:50 - but if you want to learn about
86:52 - algorithms the fundamentals of different
86:53 - algorithms all the types of things that
86:55 - i talk about in various
86:56 - coding challenges and videos with being
86:58 - able to sort of think through pseudocode
87:00 - and puzzle through it with interactive
87:02 - lessons
87:02 - um this is absolutely the course for you
87:06 - so um you can if i come back to myself
87:09 - here
87:10 - you can let's actually just go look at
87:12 - um
87:13 - i think if i go to brilliant hopefully
87:15 - i'll be signed in
87:17 - and i can go to courses and i want to go
87:20 - to
87:21 - algorithmic fundamentals
87:24 - um is that the one that it's called let
87:27 - me just look at my notes here
87:30 - about their course new courses
87:33 - pre-algebra course is another one
87:35 - algorithm oh computer science algorithms
87:37 - um is the link to it
87:39 - so i think it is this one that's
87:42 - computer science
87:43 - essentials i'm gonna go to computer
87:44 - science algorithms
87:46 - here it is this is not one that i've
87:48 - gone through yet
87:50 - but i'm going to hit start course and
87:51 - let's look i just want to see a little
87:53 - bit of this so
87:54 - about learning algo so let me move this
87:56 - over a little bit
87:58 - uh minimize uh this let's let's kind of
88:02 - go through the first lesson
88:03 - uh pseudocode um
88:07 - you're thinking about algorithms uh
88:09 - prepare some food traveling out of town
88:11 - instructions for your hamster sitter i
88:13 - could relate to this i actually had to
88:15 - leave
88:15 - instructions for our cat sitter recently
88:18 - no hamster
88:19 - um check the hamster's food bowl um look
88:22 - at this
88:23 - um all right there are four pellets in
88:25 - the bowl i didn't even look at the
88:26 - instructions check the hamster's food
88:28 - bowl
88:29 - if the food bowl is empty put five
88:31 - pellets in the bowl
88:33 - otherwise if the bowl does have some
88:36 - leftover food in it put
88:37 - three belt pellets in the pool okay
88:39 - there are four pellets in the pool
88:41 - after your cinder falls instructions you
88:42 - gave them and before the hamsters have a
88:44 - chance to nibble on anything
88:47 - uh they saw an empty bowl right
88:51 - no we can't conclude anything
88:55 - because they could have had an empty
88:56 - bowl put five in in the hamster eight
88:58 - one
88:59 - or there was some leftover food i can't
89:01 - conclude
89:03 - incorrect when the pet sitter is done
89:07 - the number of pellets in the bowl can be
89:08 - expressed as the number of pellets in
89:10 - the bowl and the sitter arrived
89:11 - and the number of pellets added to the
89:13 - bowl due to the instructions
89:17 - you can use the letter n by the way this
89:19 - is like the kind of problem i'm trying
89:20 - to help my kids with that are mad
89:22 - i'm working panicking doing this live i
89:24 - got it wrong which
89:25 - i i want to say i did on purpose even
89:27 - though i didn't but the idea is to get
89:28 - the stuff wrong and puzzle through it
89:30 - and that's the best way to learn you can
89:31 - use the letter n to represent the number
89:33 - of pellets in the bowl
89:34 - if n is zero there will be exactly five
89:37 - if n is positive there will be three
89:39 - plus
89:39 - n pellets so if there were four n is one
89:44 - four pellets of n is one that means the
89:46 - hamsters left one pellet in the ball
89:47 - from the night before
89:48 - so three more ever added that makes
89:50 - total sense
89:53 - uh okay so you can get the idea
89:56 - of what it is like to do these lessons
89:59 - um and
90:00 - uh you know again um just to see how
90:04 - they're interactive and you can start to
90:05 - manipulate
90:06 - the different elements and move them
90:07 - around it's really wonderful
90:09 - you can sign up for free at
90:11 - brilliant.org codingtrain i'm going to
90:13 - take just like a literal two-minute
90:14 - break because i only have 15 minutes
90:16 - left
90:17 - and i want to talk about wander so i'm
90:19 - going to come back and i'm going to show
90:20 - you the wander example and talk through
90:22 - it a little bit
90:23 - but i'm going to take a two-minute break
90:24 - if you have nothing else to do in the
90:25 - two minutes go to brilliant.org and
90:27 - slash coding train it's a way of
90:28 - supporting the coding train channel by
90:30 - signing up for free
90:31 - and then of course if you're interested
90:32 - in unlocking all the premium content
90:35 - uh the first 200 people do so will get a
90:36 - 20 discount
90:38 - i'm gonna take a two minute break to
90:40 - grab some water i'll be back to
90:42 - demonstrate the wander steering behavior
90:44 - in about two minutes
90:45 - and finish off for today see you in a
90:52 - [Music]
91:00 - moment
91:02 - [Music]
91:18 - [Music]
91:28 - so
91:32 - [Music]
91:42 - do
91:51 - [Music]

93:20 - do
93:29 - [Music]
93:48 - do
93:50 - [Music]
94:16 - all right everybody i took a very short
94:18 - break
94:19 - uh it is 1 42 i have to be done
94:22 - at 2 p.m which is about 20 minutes from
94:25 - now i am
94:26 - off to take the kids to see black widow
94:28 - this afternoon it is not raining outside
94:31 - if we can even get to the park uh the
94:33 - weather has broken for the day
94:36 - and the weekend is coming so
94:39 - um what is uh next
94:42 - in terms of like what i have time for
94:44 - today so what i did
94:46 - yesterday um and thank you again to
94:49 - brilliant for being the sponsor of
94:51 - today's coding trade
94:53 - what i did um yesterday so one of the
94:56 - benefits of signing up for
94:58 - a um the join button on youtube for a
95:01 - coding train
95:02 - is when i record the tutorial videos i
95:05 - will
95:05 - um kind of simulcast them to members who
95:08 - want to sort of like
95:09 - put it on in the background because it
95:11 - takes me a long time to repeat stuff and
95:12 - figure stuff out so if you want to uh
95:15 - get a peek into that um you can
95:18 - and what i did i did one of those
95:20 - sessions yesterday and i recorded a
95:22 - video tutorial about
95:23 - the wander steering behavior and so i'm
95:25 - showing to you
95:26 - up here in the right again this is the
95:28 - original java applet
95:30 - of craig reynolds um wander behavior
95:32 - it's quite a strange one
95:34 - i talk about this in the video but one
95:36 - of the things that i love about it is it
95:38 - really does emphasize
95:39 - the sort of creative thinking of these
95:42 - kinds of steering behaviors like this is
95:44 - such a made up weird
95:46 - system but it works quite well right the
95:48 - idea of wandering is to have random
95:50 - motion
95:51 - but to not have twitchy motion where
95:53 - you're just changing directions all the
95:54 - time
95:54 - but to sort of stay moving in one
95:56 - direction for a while and then move in
95:58 - the other direction
95:59 - and the way that reynolds accomplishes
96:01 - this by is by fixing
96:03 - um essentially the steering force
96:06 - to the um
96:09 - a perimeter of a circle projected out in
96:11 - front of the vehicle
96:12 - so you can see here in the diagram um
96:16 - this is the steering force in red and
96:19 - the steering force
96:20 - changes here and there but tends to if
96:22 - it's
96:23 - if it's fixed to this circular path
96:26 - it'll move to the left for a while and
96:27 - you get these kind of nice
96:29 - wandering um paths and
96:32 - you can see here in my implementation
96:35 - which i will start it over
96:37 - and let me actually give it a slightly i
96:39 - just want to be able to be able to see
96:40 - all the code and everything
96:41 - so let's just make this 600 by 600
96:45 - and i think yeah there we go so you can
96:48 - see here
96:49 - this is my wandering vehicle
96:52 - so the nice thing about this algorithm
96:53 - is this is good for
96:55 - um scenarios and i'll go back to
96:58 - reynold's paper here
96:59 - oops if you think of something like
97:04 - forage so imagine you want to have
97:07 - a creature wandering a space but if it
97:09 - gets near and sort of
97:11 - smells a bit of food it will then seek
97:13 - that food and eat it and then go back to
97:14 - wandering
97:15 - so you can use kind of wandering i think
97:17 - in different
97:19 - simulations as kind of like a default
97:21 - behavior that a particular agent will
97:24 - always go back to
97:25 - so you can see this is the
97:26 - implementation i go through this whole
97:28 - thing
97:28 - in the video which will hopefully be
97:30 - published
97:31 - uh eventually in the next week or two um
97:35 - you might also be thinking um that
97:37 - another way to implement water
97:39 - would be to use perlin noise so again
97:41 - these are
97:42 - made-up uh techniques uh i'm encouraging
97:45 - people to invent their own
97:46 - algorithm for wandering and submit it
97:48 - which you'll be able to do once i
97:49 - publish the video
97:50 - but i did do something in my wander
97:54 - which is slightly different from
97:56 - reynolds
97:57 - technique and i'm going to point that
98:00 - out here
98:01 - it's uh this so this is this
98:04 - if this here if this here is the
98:07 - point this i'll call it the sort of
98:10 - wander point the steering point
98:12 - the point to which the steering force is
98:14 - calculated
98:15 - what i do is i look at this angle
98:19 - call this angle theta i move this point
98:22 - by
98:23 - a random angular displacement to the
98:26 - counterclockwise or clockwise and we can
98:29 - see this in the code
98:33 - and boy there's no way i'm going to be
98:34 - able to get this done in 15 minutes
98:37 - but we can see this code we can see this
98:39 - in the code right here
98:41 - whoops thank you very much for showing
98:43 - me my notifications that i don't want to
98:45 - see
98:46 - um right
98:49 - displace range is 0.3 i change that
98:52 - wander angle by some random amount so
98:55 - and let's put all the debugging
98:56 - information back in
99:02 - and oh wait hold on i'm going to
99:04 - duplicate this
99:06 - wander variation i'll just call it for
99:09 - right now
99:12 - i want to put the debugging information
99:13 - back in so you can see that
99:18 - and obviously there would be a nice a
99:19 - more elegant way to have a separate
99:21 - debug draw function or something
99:23 - instead of just commenting it in and out
99:29 - and we can see there that's all the
99:32 - debug information you can see how that
99:33 - point
99:34 - to which it's steering is moving through
99:36 - random displacement
99:38 - so i personally feel
99:41 - that um this is pretty much the same
99:45 - like like my admittedly my mistake
99:49 - in not following flee precisely was
99:51 - quite a significant error this are
99:54 - significant difference i shouldn't say
99:55 - error because there's different ways to
99:57 - approach it
99:58 - this to me and i think i should also
100:00 - just to um
100:02 - work this out um let's not draw the path
100:07 - um that
100:12 - by implementing it closer to how
100:14 - reynolds describes it will make
100:16 - a less significant difference but let's
100:19 - do that nonetheless
100:21 - so what's different about it so reynolds
100:24 - writes that the random
100:26 - displacement is not
100:29 - is a vector displacement uh constrained
100:35 - um steering force the sum is constrained
100:38 - to the surface's
100:40 - sphere yeah so this here
100:43 - i if i'm going to move this point
100:45 - instead of by a fixed angle
100:47 - i'm going to move it by any displace it
100:51 - to any point away at a fixed
100:53 - radial distance and then if i move it to
100:56 - here
100:57 - i will constrain it back to the surface
101:00 - he says sphere
101:01 - because you could do this in 3d that's
101:02 - actually one of the things i wanted to
101:03 - accomplish today
101:04 - was to try to make a 3d version of this
101:06 - clearly i do not have time for that
101:08 - next live stream or whenever i have some
101:10 - time um
101:12 - so i think what i want to do maybe this
101:14 - is not that interesting to look at
101:16 - in today's live stream but we've got 10
101:18 - minutes left let's see how far i get
101:22 - i think what i want to do is instead of
101:24 - keeping track
101:25 - of this wander theta
101:28 - i want to keep track of the wander point
101:32 - and the wander point is going to be a
101:36 - vector
101:37 - and i'm just going to initialize it at
101:39 - zero
101:44 - and
101:48 - you know i call something wanderpoint
101:50 - here
101:52 - so i'm a little bit i feel like i need
101:56 - i mean it's actually fine because this
101:57 - is the lo but that'll be so confusing
102:00 - let's call this
102:04 - well let's call this force this is
102:07 - actually going to be the force
102:08 - all along so i'm going to
102:12 - change all of this
102:15 - this is a little bit awkward what i'm
102:17 - doing but i think it's going to make
102:19 - sense
102:21 - um
102:26 - force force
102:29 - force right and now actually
102:35 - force force okay
102:40 - what am i missing now
102:44 - v wander point is not defined where did
102:48 - i
102:48 - forget to replace it ah here
102:52 - force force
102:57 - where else
103:06 - uh vehicle wander ah there we go
103:11 - force there we go okay so i'm back to
103:14 - what i had before
103:16 - however i don't want to have this idea
103:19 - of an angle
103:26 - um i just wanna well i'm just gonna make
103:29 - this
103:29 - zero for right now
103:34 - okay so if it's zero it's always moving
103:36 - forward
103:42 - so the wander point i guess i need an
103:45 - initial wander point
103:47 - this is weird
103:57 - this dot wander point equals all right
103:59 - so i need uh
104:02 - this is
104:05 - yeah there's some hard-coded stuff in
104:07 - here like this 150
104:10 - so i think i need these to be this is
104:14 - uh wander distance
104:17 - is 100 and this wander
104:20 - a radius is 50.
104:24 - so this should be this wonder distance
104:28 - and this should be
104:33 - this wonder radius uh
104:36 - this wonder radius this wonder radius
104:40 - okay i just want to get what i had
104:42 - before
104:46 - um so now
104:49 - this is a little bit weird what i'm
104:50 - doing especially because i haven't
104:51 - explained the full water algorithm
104:53 - so apologies for those of you that the
104:55 - video is not out yet so thank you for
104:57 - tuning in and kind of following this
104:59 - part along
105:00 - uh probably just trying to do it in 3d
105:02 - would have been the more interesting
105:04 - choice
105:04 - for my last eight minutes here but let's
105:06 - see i'm gonna plow forward here
105:08 - so the wander point should actually be
105:16 - uh a vector
105:20 - that's um
105:25 - uh equal to p5
105:29 - vector this dot position i'm just its
105:32 - initial wander point
105:33 - is i'm adding
105:36 - its position
105:43 - oh no okay sorry the wander point
105:47 - let's make a copy of the velocity
105:52 - right it has an initial velocity
105:54 - normalize it
105:57 - and set its magnitude okay or no and set
106:00 - its magnitude
106:01 - to
106:06 - the wander distance and the wander
106:10 - radius
106:14 - right so the initial wander point and
106:17 - then
106:18 - this dot wonder point
106:21 - add its position so i just want to start
106:24 - the initial wander point at that green
106:26 - dot okay
106:29 - so and in that sense
106:33 - i don't need to
106:38 - figure out where it is
106:45 - like what if i just said for a moment
106:47 - force
106:50 - equals wander point
106:57 - copy
107:01 - this dot wander point copy because i'm
107:04 - starting
107:06 - no oh it's not um
107:11 - because it has to be relative it's
107:13 - relative to the
107:16 - oh this is harder than i thought
107:20 - but i like where i'm starting here
107:23 - which is that the wander point the first
107:26 - time
107:27 - is
107:30 - like if i just do
107:34 - no loop and
107:43 - if i take
107:59 - why why why is there an
108:02 - error here force was used before oh oh
108:05 - oh
108:08 - let me draw the debug stuff okay that's
108:11 - right
108:14 - but i'm missing the one more circle
108:18 - which is fine which is this one
108:23 - [Music]
108:30 - um
108:39 - okay there we go
108:43 - oh no no no
108:49 - the wander point is
108:58 - oh this is by the way i should just warn
109:00 - everybody this is a failure
109:02 - i'm not gonna be able to finish this
109:03 - right now and i don't even know if the
109:05 - way that i started this
109:06 - the thing is i'm trying to start with
109:09 - the point rather than an angle
109:15 - and i'm realizing that the
109:19 - um i missed an interim
109:23 - step here which is fine
109:32 - i really like the way that i did it it's
109:34 - so much easier to deal with the angle
109:37 - this is like a crazy thing that i'm
109:38 - doing here because i'm going to have to
109:41 - think through
109:45 - i don't i don't think starting with i i
109:47 - guess i could go with the angle then
109:49 - offset the point
109:52 - i could probably use like a gaussian
109:54 - distribution of changing an angular
109:56 - offset i think the way that i did it is
109:58 - just a
109:59 - frankly a better way of doing it
110:01 - somebody should prove me wrong here
110:03 - let's try this in 3d
110:05 - [Laughter]
110:07 - i have two minutes left let me answer
110:10 - your questions
110:12 - uh okay i'm gonna have to so i would
110:14 - love
110:15 - i would love for somebody to help
110:16 - contribute to this uh this is the end of
110:19 - the stream i
110:19 - obviously didn't get very far with this
110:22 - um trying to think of
110:24 - what else is coming i could use rotate
110:26 - to rotate it
110:28 - oh that's a really smart point
110:35 - but i don't really need to
110:39 - i need i need a pencil and paper here
110:42 - because what i need to do and um
110:44 - i should read some random numbers
110:47 - but is maybe i can
110:56 - i don't have my diagram i gotta go set
110:58 - up my new studio
110:59 - okay i'm gonna i'm gonna work it i'm
111:02 - gonna uh
111:03 - uh uh uh uh
111:07 - uh okay great i've got a great question
111:09 - so i'm gonna investigate this some more
111:12 - um the video will come out you will
111:14 - think about it i'll paste this
111:17 - into the discord because i clearly
111:21 - went off the rails here but if you want
111:24 - to
111:25 - start to wander variation i'll put this
111:28 - here
111:30 - into the discord maria asked a wonderful
111:33 - question which is
111:34 - hey what is a gaussian distribution i've
111:36 - heard it on sound design but not
111:38 - in animation so um good news for you
111:42 - um a gaussian are often referred to as
111:45 - normal distribution
111:46 - i do have a video about this
111:50 - let's see what happens if i search for
111:52 - it um it's a pretty old one
111:55 - from 2015 where i do go through
111:59 - interesting how it has like time codes i
112:01 - don't believe i've gone back and
112:02 - time-coded these so these are like
112:03 - automated
112:04 - you could look at this video but better
112:06 - yet
112:08 - i think if i go to natureofcode.com
112:14 - and go to the introduction
112:19 - um we can see here the idea
112:22 - of a gaussian distribution of random
112:24 - numbers
112:25 - is is not a um so
112:30 - boy it's been a long two hours i don't
112:32 - know about you but i'm exhausted
112:34 - and my brain is melting but i'm going to
112:37 - demonstrate it this way
112:39 - uh good news for myself is that i'm
112:42 - pretty sure
112:44 - i have oh yeah a nice so
112:47 - if i were this is a great visual
112:48 - demonstration if i
112:50 - were to pick a random x position
112:54 - every frame just using random the random
112:57 - function between
112:58 - zero and the width of a canvas i would
113:01 - see an
113:02 - even distribution i would be just as
113:04 - likely to pick zero
113:05 - as i would be likely to pick with as
113:07 - width divided by two as 25 as 50.
113:11 - this is not how numbers usually appear
113:14 - distributed and things you find in
113:16 - nature for you know
113:18 - human being heights are a good you know
113:20 - sort of like classic example of this
113:23 - you know there's a average height of all
113:25 - humans and most
113:26 - mo if you pick a random human from a
113:29 - room of humans
113:30 - most people will their height will be
113:32 - near that average or near that mean and
113:34 - there will be
113:35 - fewer outliers that's a normal or
113:38 - gaussian distribution
113:41 - it's often graphed as a bell curve so
113:44 - if there is um if almost
113:47 - everybody is the same height you can see
113:49 - there's a very big peak
113:51 - graphing that distribution you could
113:53 - have a wider distribution as with
113:55 - more outliers and um in p5
113:59 - i believe um if i were to just
114:02 - do exactly what i just said um
114:06 - like if i were to say let x equals
114:08 - random with
114:11 - uh circle x 200
114:14 - 100 or uh
114:17 - 20 fill
114:20 - 255 10.
114:26 - um
114:30 - we would see here and let's make this
114:33 - 50. we would see here that i'm
114:36 - filling up evenly picking random numbers
114:39 - um it would be great for me to actually
114:41 - like pile them and we'd see these piles
114:43 - piling up evenly
114:44 - because if i then did it with a gaussian
114:46 - distribution we would see
114:48 - the pile up happening in the middle but
114:50 - i can change that by saying
114:53 - let x equal random i believe this is
114:55 - built into p5
114:57 - i can give it a a mean which is width
115:01 - divided by two so that is now the
115:05 - average
115:05 - you could see like all of the numbers
115:07 - are basically right around the average
115:09 - like in theory
115:10 - any number could be picked and
115:12 - eventually given infinite time
115:13 - we would fill up some of the outliers
115:15 - but what we're looking for is what is
115:17 - the standard deviation
115:19 - what is on average how far things
115:22 - deviate from the mean
115:24 - and if i do a standard deviation of like
115:26 - 50
115:27 - now we're going to start to see that
115:29 - there is a bit more of a spread
115:30 - but still that cluster is mostly around
115:32 - the mean so here's like a standard
115:34 - deviation of 10.
115:35 - and again this isn't the best visual i
115:37 - would encourage you
115:38 - to um think about how you might visually
115:42 - demonstrate this drawing a bell curve
115:44 - would be the sort of classic way of
115:45 - doing
115:46 - it uh paint splatter is a kind of
115:48 - example that i often give could you use
115:49 - this
115:50 - to create a plate scatter and carlavan
115:52 - is saying don't forget the kids
115:53 - i definitely have to go i'm going to put
115:56 - on my goodbye song
115:58 - turn the volume down a little bit see if
116:00 - there's any more questions this is the
116:01 - end
116:04 - of today's live stream and profit says
116:07 - why did i think you're moving to the
116:08 - east coast for your sabbatical so first
116:10 - of all i already live
116:11 - on the east coast i talked about this
116:13 - more during the beginning of the live
116:14 - stream maybe that's where you are
