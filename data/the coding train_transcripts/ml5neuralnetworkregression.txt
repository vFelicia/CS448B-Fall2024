00:00 - I don't know where
you arrived from,
00:01 - but if you didn't arrive
from the previous videos
00:05 - about training your
own neural network,
00:06 - you might feel a little bit lost
because what I'm going to do
00:09 - here entirely depends on
the previous few videos
00:12 - where I trained model to
classify musical notes based
00:17 - on mouse clicks in a P5 canvas.
00:20 - So what I'm going
to do in this video
00:21 - is change this word
from classification--
00:24 - I'm going to do it right
now-- to regression,
00:27 - and this is going to
drastically change
00:29 - what the neural network outputs
and how I use that output.
00:34 - But before I start changing
anything else in the code,
00:37 - let me talk about what I mean
by regression in the context
00:42 - of machine learning.
00:43 - First, let's recap
classification.
00:48 - The idea of classification
is that the neural network
00:50 - is going to receive
some input and end up
00:53 - with a discrete,
categorical output,
00:56 - meaning it's going to
assign a label C, D, or E.
01:01 - We can think of that as
there's three light bulbs.
01:07 - Are those like little
drawings of light bulbs?
01:10 - Each light bulb is associated
with one of the possible labels
01:14 - or categories, classifications.
01:16 - And if the neural
network decides
01:18 - that this particular input
corresponds to the label E,
01:21 - then maybe this light
bulb would light up.
01:24 - And you could do this.
01:25 - You could build an
Arduino with some LEDs
01:27 - and have the results of the
machine learning classification
01:30 - light up a particular LED.
01:33 - A regression, you could
think of the output
01:35 - being a slider or maybe a dial.
01:39 - As the data comes into
the neural network,
01:42 - the dial ends up at some
value between some minimum
01:46 - and maximum.
01:47 - The output is numerical
continuous output.
01:51 - So classification is one of a
discrete set of possibilities,
01:57 - and regression is any value
between a given range.
02:02 - Now you can still have multiple
outputs in a regression
02:04 - because you can have
multiple continuous values,
02:08 - but in this case, I want
to redo this example
02:11 - by having a single
output and that output
02:14 - be the frequency value.
02:16 - So if I change the
task to regression,
02:19 - now I want my output to
be tied to a frequency.
02:23 - No longer do I want during
the training process
02:25 - to give target labels.
02:26 - I want to give target
numbers so that it
02:28 - will get the number as part
of the regression output.
02:32 - So this is my code
for data collection.
02:34 - When I click the mouse,
the inputs are in x and y,
02:37 - and the target is
a target label.
02:40 - But I don't want it to be
a target label anymore.
02:43 - I want it to be a frequency.
02:49 - And I can figure out what
that target frequency
02:51 - is by looking it up in this
particular JavaScript object.
02:55 - So I can say let target
frequency equal notes
02:58 - target label, and
in fact, that's
03:01 - something that I'm
already doing down here.
03:03 - So let's replace this
with target frequency.
03:07 - Now, ordinarily, I might
remove target label
03:09 - completely as a
variable in the system
03:11 - because I don't need
the label anymore
03:12 - for the machine learning
model, not using CDE and not
03:15 - using the note name
for training the model.
03:19 - But while I'm
collecting the data,
03:22 - I still would like to
see the note C or A or G
03:26 - because I think that's
less awkward than drawing
03:29 - the frequency number
in the window.
03:32 - So crazily, I
think I've actually
03:34 - done with all that I need
for the first two steps--
03:41 - the first two steps
being collect the data
03:43 - and train the model.
03:44 - I've changed the
task to regression,
03:46 - and now I obtained the output
to a single output node that
03:54 - just has a frequency value.
03:56 - So I should be able to run
all of the bits of code
03:59 - that I did before and
have a train the model.
04:01 - Let's see if that works.
04:03 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
04:08 - All right, collected some
data-- let's train the model.
04:13 - And it worked.
04:14 - I mean, it worked
in the sense that I
04:15 - didn't don't see any
errors in the console,
04:17 - and I see a nice graph with the
loss going all the way down.
04:20 - Incidentally, the lost went
way down very, very quickly.
04:23 - / I probably don't
need 200 epochs.
04:25 - Maybe this regression problem
is a little bit easier for it
04:27 - to learn more accurately.
04:29 - Who knows?
04:29 - But it optimized very quickly.
04:31 - So now that collecting data
and training the model is done,
04:35 - I need to just do that last
stage of basically deploying
04:38 - the model and making
predictions with new data.
04:42 - And I don't think
this is going to work.
04:44 - I haven't adjusted
the code at all.
04:45 - It's still looking for
a label and all that.
04:47 - So who knows what will happen.
04:52 - First of all, it's writing the
word frequency here and just
04:55 - playing one particular note.
04:56 - So let's go look at
the prediction code
04:58 - and see what need to
adjust for a regression.
05:00 - First thing is because we're
no longer doing classification,
05:04 - we shouldn't call model.classify
with the given inputs.
05:07 - We want to change this
to model.classify.
05:10 - So predict is the function
name for a regression.
05:12 - Classify is the function
name for a classification.
05:15 - Let's collect it again
and retrain the model.
05:22 - It's trained.
05:22 - Let me click into the canvas,
and let's look and see
05:26 - what came out here.
05:29 - So this is what I get back.
05:30 - I get back an array.
05:31 - I only have one output
in this particular model,
05:34 - and so I look at the 0
element of that array.
05:37 - This is the value it predicted.
05:39 - And I have a label that in
case I had multiple things,
05:41 - I could sort of know
which goes with which.
05:43 - So based on what's here, I want
to change this to results index
05:47 - 0 .value.
05:50 - That's the frequency
that I want to play.
05:52 - Now what do I want to draw?
05:54 - Maybe I'll actually
look at the number.
05:56 - So let's actually
also draw that,
05:59 - but maybe we'll take
away the decimal place
06:02 - by using floor just
so it's less busy,
06:05 - takes up less room
in the canvas itself.
06:07 - OK, all right, let me add
that save data feature.
06:11 - Before I collect the
data, let me just change
06:13 - that for epochs to 50 because
I don't need 200 epochs.
06:17 - Now I'm going to
collect a bunch of data,
06:18 - so let me make a bunch of Cs.
06:25 - I clicked around
somewhat arbitrarily,
06:27 - but let me now
actually save this,
06:28 - so I don't have to always
collect the data again
06:30 - every single time.
06:32 - So I'm saying that
to a JSON file.
06:34 - I am now going to
train the model.
06:39 - What do I expect to happen?
06:41 - Before when I was
doing classification,
06:43 - I would expect to hear a C
when I click near the Cs and F
06:47 - when I click near the Fs.
06:48 - And I would hopefully get
something similar to that.
06:50 - Like does this sound
like a C to you?
06:54 - You can hear it's
changing, though, f.
06:58 - But look, I'm getting a
different note every time
07:10 - because the regression, once
again, remember is like a dial.
07:14 - So if I have the
notes C over here
07:17 - and I have the note
E over here, ideally,
07:21 - when I click here, I'm
going to get a note that's
07:23 - in between like D.
07:25 - But the notes are
completely irrelevant here.
07:27 - It's really all about
the numbers, the idea
07:30 - being that if I have
the number 200 here
07:32 - and I have the number 300
here, clicking in between
07:35 - is like having a
slider or a dial
07:37 - going between 200 all
the way up to 300.
07:41 - And while this works in
a somewhat obvious way
07:44 - in this two-dimensional
space with me putting
07:46 - a lot of Cs over here and
a lot of Gs over there,
07:48 - you could imagine how this
could become a much more
07:51 - sophisticated
musical instrument,
07:53 - or the output doesn't even
have to be a musical frequency,
07:57 - a sound frequency.
07:58 - There's so many possibilities.
08:00 - But now we've seen
that in addition
08:04 - to using the ML5 neural
network for classification.
08:08 - You can also use
it for regression.
08:10 - So what's next?
08:12 - Let's think of some
exercises for you to do.
08:14 - So first of all,
I right now I have
08:15 - to click around
to hear the note,
08:17 - but there's no reason why,
in this particular example,
08:19 - I couldn't move the mouse around
and have that frequency adjust.
08:24 - I don't need an
envelope anymore maybe
08:25 - on this continuously
playing a note.
08:27 - So that may be
something that you try.
08:29 - You can play around
with saving the model,
08:31 - saving the data, all that
stuff that I showed you
08:33 - in the previous two videos
with this regression example
08:36 - as well.
08:36 - But ultimately, I think what
I want to look at here--
08:39 - and I will come back and do
another video-- is what are
08:43 - some ideas for inputs that allow
for more creative or surprising
08:48 - results than just mouse clicks?
08:50 - And I think the one that I want
to show you is using Poe's net.
08:53 - So Poe's net is also a
machine learning model
08:56 - that takes an image as
the input and guesses
09:01 - where you parts
of your body are,
09:03 - so it can find your
nose and your eyes
09:05 - and your hands and your elbows--
09:06 - a whole set of key
points on a human body.
09:09 - Why not train a
model to recognize
09:12 - as the inputs certain
poses and then
09:14 - have a particular output
associated with that.
09:17 - So I'm going to
build a project using
09:19 - all of this stuff
in the next video.
09:22 - I think I'll make it
a coding challenge,
09:24 - build a project that
does pose classification
09:28 - with the ML5 neural
network library,
09:31 - or maybe it'll be
posed regression.
09:32 - I don't know.
09:33 - We'll see.
09:34 - It'll be in the next video.
09:35 - Thanks for watching,
and I look forward
09:37 - to all of your
questions and comments
09:38 - and all that sort of stuff.
09:39 - Goodbye.
