00:00 - now is the moment finally after all this
00:03 - time installing node setting up node
00:06 - running NPM getting an API key signing
00:09 - up for Twitter all that nonsense it's
00:11 - time to playfully write some code that
00:14 - connects to the Twitter API search for
00:16 - tweets get an event every time somebody
00:19 - @ mentions you download images from
00:22 - Twitter all sorts of things post tweets
00:24 - to Twitter
00:26 - we're finally I'm finally going to I
00:27 - think in this video get to show you all
00:29 - that stuff so this is where we are so
00:32 - far we just have a simple node program
00:34 - says that it's starting Ascenta kate's
00:36 - using a separate config dot yes file
00:38 - that I showed you the previous video
00:40 - uses the twit package and now the before
00:42 - I start to get writing code let's talk
00:44 - about what the kinds of commands you can
00:47 - issue to the Twitter API so there I
00:50 - would put these in under three
00:52 - categories you can call with with twit
00:57 - and with the API you can make a get
01:00 - request so with a get request some
01:03 - things you might do is search and you
01:05 - could search you know by like hash tag
01:07 - you could search by location you could
01:11 - search by user there's lots of ways you
01:14 - could search and just say give me all
01:15 - the tweets that's have JavaScript give
01:17 - me all the tweets about rainbows I don't
01:19 - have any guy I feel like I need some
01:20 - hashtags associated with this rainbow
01:22 - with this ring with this this videos
01:25 - I'll think of something big assigning
01:26 - yourself and then another the other kind
01:30 - of command you might issue to the API is
01:32 - a post and this is where you're actually
01:35 - tweeting twittering tor Twix twitting
01:40 - tape stirring tweeting okay I'm post
01:45 - post is where you're actually like
01:47 - posting to these so you have some
01:49 - generative poetry machine you made it
01:51 - has a beat pit of text and boom it
01:54 - automatically posted Twitter through
01:55 - making a post so we need to look at
01:57 - those two and the third one which is
01:59 - going to be I might not do in this
02:00 - particular video but is super important
02:03 - is this idea of a stream so the
02:07 - difference between these first two ways
02:09 - of creating the API get is just like
02:11 - give me 100 tweets
02:12 - we're done we're never talking to each
02:14 - other again unless I ask her 100 more
02:16 - tweets I don't know if you can actually
02:17 - get a hundred of time but a post is like
02:20 - please post this for me okay we're done
02:23 - I might ask you to post again later but
02:25 - right now we're done stream is like
02:27 - let's fit bconnected
02:29 - twitter api like let's just be one we
02:32 - are one and whenever something happens I
02:34 - want you to tell me about it we've got
02:36 - like this continuous connection like a
02:37 - socket connection which is the kind of
02:39 - network connection so you can assign
02:41 - certain kinds of events to the stream so
02:44 - if you want to have and we're I'm using
02:47 - this in one of my examples is anytime
02:49 - somebody act mentions me on Twitter this
02:53 - stream triggers an event and I could
02:55 - have some code that replies back one of
02:58 - my favorite current BOTS I think is
03:00 - called apology Trump which I believe is
03:03 - a Twitter bot that just like anytime
03:04 - Trump tweets boy sometimes when you're
03:06 - watching this video and like thank you
03:08 - okay nobody should be watching this
03:09 - video 100 cheers but likely somebody's
03:11 - watching this video in a hundred years
03:12 - which are clearly not going to be or
03:14 - buddy in just like two years from now is
03:16 - anybody gonna care about Trump no but
03:18 - the apology Trump bought hopefully will
03:20 - live on into the future
03:21 - and what it does is anytime Trump tweets
03:24 - it tweets an apology
03:26 - for Trump which is very thoughtful and
03:29 - nice of it I wish somebody would just
03:30 - apologize for me all the time as I walk
03:32 - around bumping into things but you can
03:35 - imagine how that's a streaming event so
03:37 - there's an event anytime Trump tweets
03:38 - the program that's running that's
03:40 - connected to the stream it gets an event
03:42 - it says I read that tweet make up some
03:44 - apology and post that apology so you
03:47 - know your your wheels are hopefully
03:48 - spinning with a ton of ideas of what you
03:50 - could do so these are the three
03:53 - methodologies so let's look let's look
03:56 - first at you know in a way this is all
03:59 - you need
03:59 - I'm tempted to just like only show you
04:02 - post because that's all you need but
04:03 - let's just look at let's actually look
04:05 - at each one of these kind of in a vacuum
04:07 - in this particular video and the next
04:10 - video will set up the structure for how
04:12 - a bot might work whether it's tweeting
04:14 - every five minutes or one hour or
04:16 - tweeting based on the stream so let's
04:18 - look at each one of these first okay so
04:20 - coming back over here hello
04:23 - I'm gonna go what I think the most
04:25 - useful place for us to look
04:26 - would be back to the github the twit API
04:28 - that started the twit package github
04:30 - page which I'll try to include a link to
04:33 - it but you can see is up here and so now
04:36 - you can see okay there's some stuff here
04:37 - like post and search so you can see a
04:40 - post is making a status update but so
04:45 - each one of these kinds of I think
04:47 - there's like this term like end point or
04:49 - whatever but let's not worry about the
04:51 - terminology the action the verb I'm
04:54 - doing is a post or a get and I'm
04:56 - modifying that get or post with some
04:59 - text like I might want to post a status
05:02 - update or I might want to post some
05:04 - media you'll see when uploading an image
05:05 - but let's look at this get one first so
05:07 - I'm just going to grab this code and I'm
05:09 - going to paste it into my program now
05:12 - I'm going to you close your overt your
05:13 - eyes for a second and I'm actually going
05:15 - to change something about it I'm going
05:18 - to grab this well I don't have a lot of
05:23 - but this big font I don't have a lot of
05:24 - space here
05:25 - and I'm going to I'm going to rewrite
05:28 - this for a second just to give you some
05:32 - more room so this is a little bit tricky
05:39 - here because I made this kind of awkward
05:40 - actually
05:41 - okay I'm gonna I got I got an idea sorry
05:42 - I was daydreaming again I'm gonna do
05:46 - this I'm rewriting this code in a way
05:50 - that I feel like might be a little bit
05:51 - more digestible for us to look at and ah
06:00 - I should done this in advance it's okay
06:04 - just just check it you meditate for a
06:06 - minute or something while I'm like anal
06:08 - anally retentive li-like aligning all of
06:12 - the I'm gonna stop I it's okay I can I
06:14 - can live with this okay so what I did
06:17 - just just if you were wondering is in
06:20 - the in the sorry I just have to fix my I
06:24 - really like I've been thinking about
06:25 - making this video called the anal
06:28 - retentive coder which is like based on
06:30 - the satellite guys silent live sketch
06:32 - the anal retentive chef but I'm going to
06:35 - get into that now but if you're if
06:36 - you're into that just remind me I'll
06:38 - make that video for you
06:39 - I kind of have a problem but what I the
06:41 - reason why I did all that it just took
06:43 - me a minute or two to like reformat this
06:44 - is often a JavaScript code is written in
06:48 - this very like I'm going to write this
06:50 - all this code in this like one line of
06:52 - code and it's going to have a function
06:54 - call with a couple objects in it and
06:56 - then an anonymous function to another
06:57 - function with a callback and I think for
06:59 - teaching and for learning and for
07:00 - practicing it's often easier to like
07:02 - break the stuff out into pieces so I
07:05 - don't have any problem this this is
07:06 - actually you know not that much intro
07:08 - simple but what I did is I took this
07:10 - example which had a function call an
07:13 - object as an argument to that and then
07:16 - another function isn't as an argument to
07:18 - that function call and I broke it into
07:20 - three pieces so this here is the get
07:23 - request I am asking Twitter to search
07:25 - for tweets and then I need to give it
07:27 - some more information about what to
07:29 - search for and so I could give it a
07:31 - query term like rainbow I was good and
07:35 - then a coding rainbow that's it hashtag
07:38 - coding raivo that's the hashtag for this
07:39 - for this video whatever uh count 100 so
07:45 - I want and let's just let's just ask for
07:46 - like two tweets back to be like a little
07:48 - bit simpler about this so I can modify
07:51 - the search with a bunch of things and if
07:53 - you go look in the Twitter API
07:54 - documentation you'll see there's lots of
07:56 - other kind of parameters for the search
07:58 - that you might put there and then I need
08:00 - a callback function
08:01 - I need a function that will be triggered
08:03 - when the I need a function that will be
08:07 - triggered when the data has been
08:09 - returned from the API this is just like
08:11 - you know jQuery AJAX call or a p5.js lo
08:15 - json call so you set up this API query
08:18 - you give it a callback you play with the
08:20 - data when the callback comes back so you
08:22 - make an object that has some parameters
08:23 - in it you trigger the get I want to
08:26 - search Twitter and you give it the
08:27 - parameters you have the callback and so
08:29 - let's see what happens here now if we
08:32 - run this particular thing I'm like
08:35 - afraid if this is going to work or not
08:37 - please work heylook so we got all this
08:39 - stuff how am I supposed to make sense of
08:41 - this so this is this is like a little
08:43 - bit of a problem now which is that like
08:44 - okay I there's all this JSON like I
08:47 - could like paces into the another file
08:50 - and I could look at it so in the end
08:52 - think maybe it might be one of the
08:54 - things that I often do is actually have
08:55 - no write out the results to a text file
08:57 - and then I can like look at it later and
08:59 - I could show you a technique for doing
09:00 - that at some point but here we can
09:02 - actually you know I could even probably
09:04 - pretty easily kind of like figure out
09:06 - that I'm I think what what I'm looking
09:09 - for scrolling scrolling scrolling this
09:11 - is actually really hard to find is I'm
09:14 - looking for status text source there it
09:20 - is text so this is what I'm looking for
09:22 - like the text of the tweet you can see
09:23 - has some like emojis in it and you can
09:25 - see this statuses right so the beginning
09:28 - of the object is statuses then there is
09:30 - a then there is an array and the thing
09:33 - that I want in the array is text so for
09:35 - example something I could do here is I
09:37 - could say alright far tweets equals data
09:43 - statuses and I could say for VAR I
09:47 - equals 0 I is less than tweets length I
09:50 - plus plus and I could say now console
09:54 - dot log console dot log tweets index I
09:59 - dot txt now I'm pretty sure I got that
10:01 - right just because I've used the Twitter
10:03 - API before and I have a sense of how the
10:04 - JSON is structured there's a lot more
10:06 - information like who is the tweet from
10:08 - was it retweet you know it doesn't have
10:11 - any hashtags there's all sorts of things
10:12 - you can find out in there but at least
10:15 - now we could try running it again and
10:17 - you can see I got program your own
10:19 - rainbow dash vote its man you Ella Alex
10:22 - cuz a double rainbow is hard to find so
10:24 - you can see I got the raw text from
10:26 - those tweets there so again this is it
10:29 - there's not a lot of code here like this
10:31 - that's what all we said all this time
10:33 - like figure out how to install that
10:33 - package because the package does it all
10:35 - for you so we now are able to search
10:37 - Twitter and go through it now you know
10:39 - it might be worth actually let's go look
10:41 - at the Twitter API documentation because
10:43 - I kind of did that because I kind of
10:45 - half already know how to do that that
10:46 - was ok it was a little bit like cheating
10:48 - you a little bit so let's go and see
10:50 - like what if you really wanted to figure
10:51 - this out you could go to the to dev
10:55 - twitter.com and you know I'm just going
10:59 - to I'm actually just going to do a
11:00 - Google search for like Twitter API get
11:04 - and then one thing I might do is
11:06 - paste this search - search / tweets if I
11:10 - do that you can see look at this I found
11:12 - a reference page dabbed at Twitter come
11:14 - rest reference get search tweets so you
11:17 - can see this would hopefully now be the
11:19 - page that's the most useful to you
11:21 - because you can see here like a bunch of
11:24 - things like the query that is looking
11:25 - for a rainbow I can add a geo code a
11:27 - language all sorts of things that count
11:30 - you think these are the other types of
11:32 - parameters that could go inside this
11:34 - object right here to modify that search
11:36 - and then down here you can see an
11:39 - example result so this is where I want
11:41 - to look and see like okay what I need is
11:44 - the object statuses and then looking for
11:49 - and kind of go through and see that text
11:53 - is here excuse me I just burped on a
11:55 - live stream that's Barry and a recorded
11:57 - this is going to be recorded okay so we
11:59 - gonna like edit that sound flip out and
12:01 - make some song out of it maybe you
12:03 - couldn't hear that at all so aggressive
12:05 - Pony - anyway I don't want to get you
12:08 - far into this if you're interested in
12:09 - how you like search through JSON or how
12:11 - JSON is formatted I have some other
12:12 - videos that I'll try to remember to link
12:14 - to that you could look at that'll get
12:15 - you up to speed there so that's how you
12:17 - can see how you can kind of like figure
12:19 - out exactly like what goes in here and
12:21 - what goes in here but the structure is
12:23 - here now for you require the TWiT
12:26 - package make a authenticate set up some
12:29 - parameters make a get request handle
12:31 - that grant request okay
12:32 - so now that we've done that that twelve
12:35 - minutes um in the let's let me do the
12:38 - post because the post is kind of easy
12:40 - we're going to get to that into in
12:41 - really fast so I'm gonna let's go for
12:43 - I'm able do streaming in the next video
12:45 - or a little bit later so post is the
12:47 - next thing that you might want to do so
12:50 - yet which is searching on Twitter post
12:52 - is tweeting so what I should be able to
12:55 - do now is add a I'm going to leave this
12:59 - stuff up I'm going to leave this stuff
13:01 - at the bottom actually let me just do
13:03 - I'm going to do save as bot to Jas I
13:07 - probably should make a whole new node
13:08 - thing but just so I can get rid of this
13:11 - code for a second and what I'm going to
13:14 - do is now go back to the github page for
13:17 - the twit
13:19 - I never thought at any point in my life
13:21 - I'd be saying things like I'm gonna go
13:23 - back to the github page for the twit
13:24 - like what does that even mean
13:27 - and I'm going to look under post here
13:29 - and I'm going to grab this example T dot
13:32 - post and I'm going to do the same thing
13:34 - to it so what do I need for t dot post I
13:37 - need I need to post I need the path I
13:39 - want a status update I need an object
13:41 - that's going to have the information for
13:44 - that status update
13:45 - like the I'll call it the tweet and then
13:48 - I'll call the callback tweeted how many
13:51 - variations of the word twit tweet tweet
13:54 - ur Twitter can come and possibly have a
13:56 - lot apparently so what I need to do here
13:59 - is first make that tweet object and
14:03 - actually the only thing that needs to go
14:05 - in that tweet object is a hashtag coding
14:14 - rainbow and so that's my tweet hashtag
14:19 - coding rainbow from nodejs and then I
14:24 - need to have again a callback function
14:28 - tweeted with it with these arguments now
14:32 - I didn't really talk about this there's
14:34 - like a whole bunch of arguments so I'm
14:39 - just kind of fixing this up and you can
14:41 - see I'm doing the same exact thing here
14:43 - I have my tweet object which is one
14:45 - parameter obviously there could be more
14:47 - things as you can see if I'm going to
14:48 - like tweet with an image I might have
14:50 - like a property of this tweet object
14:53 - that has a media element to it I'm going
14:56 - to post to the Twitter API status update
14:58 - I'm going to post this status update and
15:00 - this is the callback when it's finished
15:01 - so a couple things number one is you
15:04 - don't really need the callback here
15:06 - because there's no information you need
15:08 - back you're just sending to Twitter but
15:10 - it's often useful have a callback
15:11 - because what if it doesn't work what if
15:13 - you have the wrong API key or what if
15:15 - there's like you have more than 140
15:17 - characters or there's an invalid
15:18 - character or something else goes wrong
15:19 - so you can see here there's like three
15:22 - different arguments error data response
15:24 - and so I that was probably in the other
15:26 - one as well
15:27 - error you can imagine if you're going to
15:30 - that error argue
15:31 - our parameter is filled with information
15:33 - should there be an error so something
15:35 - you can often do is say something like
15:37 - if error console dot log you know
15:41 - something went wrong otherwise I could
15:46 - say console dot log data and somewhere
15:49 - in here I could pull out you know
15:51 - something from there but what I might
15:53 - just do is just say like it works right
15:56 - now so here I just want my bot that I'm
15:59 - making to when when after it posts a
16:02 - tweet to either say something went wrong
16:03 - or it worked
16:04 - now this isn't great practice because
16:06 - ultimately if something goes wrong I
16:07 - need to figure out what that error is
16:08 - and really log it so you you know that's
16:11 - something you could certainly do but I'm
16:12 - not going to worry about it too much
16:13 - right now so this is it right all that
16:15 - you need to do to post to Twitter from
16:17 - node is this set up the tweet T dot post
16:20 - have a call back now of course we make
16:23 - the bot we have to figure out how do you
16:24 - schedule that and all of that but for
16:26 - now let's just see if this works so I'm
16:28 - excited to see what happens I'm going to
16:30 - go back here and I made this by the way
16:32 - a file called bot 2 so I'm going to run
16:34 - bot - right now I'm gonna run it the bot
16:37 - is starting I say that it worked I'm
16:39 - gonna go to Twitter oh my god this is
16:42 - like uh where am I going
16:44 - I don't know I'm like way too excited
16:45 - here I'm gonna go to my a to Z account
16:48 - and I'm gonna see that there it is
16:51 - there's my tweet that I tweeted from
16:53 - node hashtag oh it looks like it says
16:57 - code in grain bow but it's a little bit
16:59 - weight with a Maconie horn boat from
17:01 - nodejs so this is great so now you've
17:03 - really got a lot of stuff to work with
17:05 - because you know first of all I could
17:07 - have searched Twitter for the term
17:08 - rainbow and then I could have like put
17:10 - all those things into like an array and
17:12 - then I could have taken one word from
17:14 - each tweet and I could have mash them up
17:15 - you know the possibilities are endless
17:16 - of what you can do in terms of querying
17:19 - and reposting or you know you could make
17:21 - a Twitter bio just picks a random number
17:24 - and tweets the random number every time
17:25 - you run it so what I would do is come up
17:27 - with some really sort of drop dead
17:28 - simple idea of how you might generate a
17:31 - tweet just from a little bit of code a
17:33 - random number or something or pick
17:35 - something from an array or even just
17:37 - like hard code the tweet in there get
17:39 - your node program tweeting to the
17:41 - account once you have that you're
17:42 - absolutely ready for the next step the
17:44 - next step is
17:45 - scheduling it like a bot and then and
17:48 - then ultimately I want also want to
17:50 - touch on how to use this stream thing
17:52 - and Oh as if I forgotten we I need to
17:54 - show you how to use processing to make
17:55 - images that you could tweet oh it's
17:57 - already 12:10
