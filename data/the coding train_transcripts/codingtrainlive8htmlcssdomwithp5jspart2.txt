01:22 - great thank you all right so you hear me
01:25 - look so actually I'm using a new version
01:27 - of
01:28 - wirecast which I have here and that's
01:30 - why I have this like infinite Zoom
01:33 - thing uh but I'm trying to see how far
01:36 - behind um how far behind the stream is
01:41 - so I'm going to make a funny expression
01:43 - in face and then count and see how long
01:45 - till I see it in the actual uh see all
01:48 - in the delay so here we
01:50 - go 1 1,00 2 1000 3 1,000 4 1,000 5 1,000
01:56 - 6 1,000 7 1,000 8 1,000 9 1,000 10 1,00
02:00 - 11 1,00 12 1,00 30 1,00 401 so about 14
02:05 - or 15 seconds is the lag between when I
02:07 - do something and you see
02:09 - it uh okay um I have only 35 minutes um
02:15 - I swear I'm hearing myself back audio
02:17 - somewhere hello but I don't know where
02:20 - that's coming from I got like three
02:21 - different machines in here all doing

04:19 - it's
04:20 - the uh okay I need
04:23 - to log back into

06:16 - good about this though is I know not
06:18 - very many people are going to tune into
06:19 - this but I often take these like short
06:21 - little breaks I could just click the
06:23 - play ad button um sorry I'm trying to
06:26 - what I'm trying to do right now is fix
06:29 - an ISS issue I had with the previous
06:30 - videos I was making um I don't know
06:33 - where why I've Got Sublime Text open I
06:36 - need to go and
06:37 - get the newest p5js and I actually just
06:42 - want this single
06:44 - file and I want to close the editor and
06:49 - I want to find the example I'm making
06:52 - which was under Dom under
06:56 - slider other events and I want want this
06:59 - p5js file in there and I want this one
07:02 - to go away and then I want to launch the
07:07 - editor again I don't know uh quick
07:10 - Chrome close all these
07:12 - things
07:15 - and uh launch the editor
07:19 - again and there we go I have a feeling
07:22 - this is going to work
07:24 - now no
07:27 - error oh what did I do oh
07:30 - oh editor crash editor
07:35 - crash
07:37 - technology okay
07:42 - um
07:44 - uh I thought Lauren McCarthy are you
07:49 - there maybe she's in the
07:53 - hallway oh no she's teaching in class so
07:56 - there's a there's a trying to make a
07:58 - certain Feature work in p5js that was
08:00 - recently added but there was also a bug
08:01 - in a recent version of p5js which caused
08:04 - the editor to break I don't even know if
08:06 - I have the most recent version of the
08:08 - editor this is great to do this Live
08:11 - Well I could definitely use another
08:12 - editor I'm just uh trying to use
08:18 - um uh let me
08:21 - uh let me see here if I have the most
08:24 - recent version of the
08:26 - editor oh you know what I know what it
08:28 - is that I can fix
08:29 - manually aha so editor crashing with
08:33 - this
08:33 - version uh the line of code where it's
08:39 - crashing was comment this line
08:42 - out uh this doevents device motion
08:46 - equals
08:47 - null
08:48 - so um let me get the editor again
08:55 - open uh and let me go into here
09:00 - [Music]
09:05 - find let's just comment that out oops no
09:08 - no no no no I need to open the
09:11 - actual thing that I want to open other
09:14 - events and go to libraries p5js and I
09:19 - move this over here if anyone wants to
09:21 - watch what I'm doing def find this there
09:22 - we
09:25 - go and that should do the trick
09:31 - doesn't crash and this was it there we
09:37 - go success nobody has any nobody cares
09:40 - but I I I recorded a video earlier today
09:43 - which was like 20 minutes long 10
09:45 - minutes of it was trying to debug this
09:48 - problem uh and oh three people somebody
09:50 - else joined I can see exactly the number
09:53 - I love this new YouTube live streaming
09:54 - thing who are you third person who's not
09:57 - Sharon Dela Cruz or Jay David I ber oh
10:00 - you left cuz there's only two people
10:01 - watching or one of you left when when
10:03 - you have such a small audience like me I
10:05 - can pinpoint exactly who's there and
10:06 - who's not there um all right it is 2:30
10:10 - p.m. I am going to see I'm going to see
10:13 - if I can make uh another
10:16 - video
10:18 - um and uh hide
10:21 - sidebar uh actually show sidebar I'm
10:24 - going to close the browser here uh so
10:27 - this is where I am these are this is my
10:28 - list videos I'm going to see if I can do
10:31 - a CSS video so this video number six
10:35 - here is the one that was a total sort of
10:37 - failure and I I should go back and
10:38 - re-record it or do it in a different way
10:40 - or leave it as it is and record an extra
10:43 - little section that fixes it um but in
10:47 - the
10:48 - uh uh but in the
10:52 - um uh in the brief amount of time that I
10:55 - have I think I'm going to do the uh uh
10:57 - CSS and style
11:00 - uh video so couple things I need to do
11:02 - one is I just need to test that my
11:03 - recording system is actually working so
11:06 - I'm going to do that for a second and
11:07 - I'm going to hit
11:08 - record and then I'm going to dance
11:11 - around and
11:13 - sing
11:15 - um what's the song that I've uh there's
11:19 - usually a song that I sing I don't know
11:21 - what it is never mind no singing no
11:23 - singing aloud I'm going to go over here
11:26 - fraka F I'm not over here there we go uh
11:31 - you can see that the camera is in
11:32 - slightly the wrong position there we go
11:35 - that maybe helps uh to focus okay can
11:37 - you read this uh I'm going to come back
11:39 - over here and test this and I'm going to
11:42 - hit stop recording and then I should see
11:45 - on the
11:46 - desktop a file that I just recently
11:51 - recorded
11:53 - uh and it says today 2:34 p.m. ICM _ 0
11:59 - 41 megabytes I'm going to open up this
12:02 - video file and play
12:05 - it I turn the volume on to see if
12:07 - there's
12:12 - sound I'm
12:15 - check uh I want to check
12:21 - um my God I'm losing my
12:25 - mind I shouldn't live stream when I'm
12:27 - just like doing testing
12:29 - but I have to test that this new way
12:31 - works show movie
12:33 - inspector uh 30 frames per second 1280
12:36 - by
12:37 - 720 data size data rate all right I'm
12:41 - happy with this close
12:44 - this turn the volume back
12:47 - off close close so who would like who is
12:53 - there interested in the topic of more
12:56 - comments below only one everybody left
13:00 - one person who are you one person who
13:02 - Happ to left their left their browser
13:04 - open by accident
13:06 - um uh okay um let's see
13:11 - here
13:15 - uh uh okay
13:20 - um let's see maybe I should work on the
13:24 - green screening you guys want to this is
13:26 - going to I wonder if I can do this live
13:28 - while while I'm streaming so if I hit
13:31 - edit
13:32 - shot and I go to the green
13:35 - screen and I go to the chroma key and I
13:38 - check you can see are you seeing I
13:41 - should uh go back to the live dashboard
13:44 - you should see me right now in front of
13:46 - a green wall oh you can see the like
13:48 - Shadow here which is really
13:51 - because of the lighting let's see if I
13:53 - can fix that a little
13:57 - bit better worse oh you know what it is
14:01 - it's this table here I don't really care
14:04 - so much but I really should probably
14:06 - make that
14:07 - better
14:11 - um uh I have a
14:14 - light that I think just needs to point
14:16 - up more so if I put something under it
14:20 - like a
14:22 - book I I'll do anything to not have to
14:25 - record a video about CSS
14:27 - apparently this is an empty
14:32 - box let's do
14:35 - that o that created a strange new
14:40 - Shadow probably just need to put it over
14:43 - here and now I'm going to trip on
14:47 - myself I also oh look at this like weird
14:49 - extra Shadows I I'll work on this
14:52 - later good enough for
14:55 - now that's a little bit little bit
14:58 - better a little bit better little bit
15:01 - worse who
15:03 - knows
15:05 - um let's uh go back to use chroma key
15:10 - and
15:12 - uh I see and now I I do this okay
15:17 - no
15:18 - defaults uh pick color key with the
15:27 - mouse
15:32 - uh oh well I think that'll just be good
15:41 - enough
15:44 - uh yeah seeing in front of the text not
15:47 - pure
15:54 - green uh okay let's see do I have time
16:01 - 239 um I have 20
16:06 - minutes shall I make this
16:10 - happen yeah okay I'm going to do
16:13 - something about
16:15 - CSS CSS style so I'm I just want to make
16:20 - an example a little bit from
16:23 - scratch I'll leave the
16:26 - button get rid of the slider and the
16:28 - input field I'll leave the background
16:30 - color variable I will get rid of this
16:33 - canvas event
16:35 - stuff
16:41 - um
16:44 - and oh I definitely need a create P I
16:48 - need
16:55 - a and I'm going to get rid of all these
16:58 - these
16:59 - events
17:01 - and
17:09 - uh
17:10 - [Music]
17:11 - and let me make
17:19 - this like
17:22 - this and
17:25 - uh oh yes it doesn't look so great the
17:27 - green screen
17:29 - okay
17:34 - um
17:36 - and uh let me run this and
17:39 - see change color is not
17:42 - defined a
17:47 - problem see kind far can I get away with
17:49 - this okay change color is not to
17:53 - find that's all right I don't need an
17:55 - event right
17:57 - now
18:03 - all right
18:09 - uh and there we go okay uh I have this
18:13 - web page I have the
18:17 - editor

18:37 - correctly
18:46 - and okay now getting ready here to make
18:52 - this
18:53 - video ah the green screen got a little
18:56 - better I think it has to do with um

24:56 - time I have uh office hours appointments
24:58 - at 3M so I meant to do this from 2: to 3
25:02 - but I I set up an entirely new streaming
25:05 - system I'm very small here um uh um and
25:10 - it took me 45 minutes to do that so I
25:12 - sort of lost all my time but I'm going
25:13 - to try to at least get one more video
25:15 - out I did a whole bunch this morning um
25:18 - and uh Mark Abby is in the chat Mark
25:20 - Abby is in the chat uh he has done a ton
25:23 - of work on the uh Dom Library over the
25:26 - summer and and uh as part of Google sum
25:30 - of code a lot of the new features are
25:31 - thanks to him and uh if you have actual
25:34 - questions about how it works or what it
25:35 - does you can ask in the chat he knows
25:37 - more about it than I do and I am I
25:39 - shrinking I feel so tiny uh okay I'm
25:42 - just gonna leave it um okay
25:46 - um here we go oh look at this I swear
25:50 - every time I look over I'm getting
25:52 - smaller I'm going to just set check
25:55 - these settings One Time One More Time
25:57 - time on this
25:59 - shot um there we
26:07 - go ah I see I have to click in and out
26:09 - okay I should be I got a lot of Shadow
26:11 - and a lot of issues going on but it's
26:14 - such as life I need to the lighting
26:17 - somehow in here just totally changed but
26:19 - um here we go I only have 10 minutes now
26:21 - if I keep talking I'm going to lose all
26:23 - my
26:25 - time uh
26:34 - all right so this video is about a giant
26:36 - topic one again that I know very little
26:39 - about uh and that topic is CSS and so uh
26:42 - you know there's been a bunch of videos
26:43 - here that I've made about the Dom the
26:45 - document object model web pages HTML
26:49 - Pages JavaScript how they control HTML
26:51 - Pages let's just take a step back for a
26:53 - moment and and and look at the pieces we
26:55 - know about and what's this third piece
26:57 - that I'm adding so this web page this
27:00 - thing that you're seeing in the browser
27:02 - or in the sort of browser window of the
27:04 - p5js editor where I'm writing all the
27:06 - code there the the thing that this page
27:09 - loads is a file called
27:12 - index.html okay so and this is not a
27:15 - good pen I'm switching pens in this file
27:18 - there is some content written into that
27:20 - file for example uh there is a header
27:24 - that's at the top of the page there's a
27:25 - paragraph this file is also referring to
27:29 - some JavaScript code uh it's referring
27:32 - to a bunch of different things like the
27:34 - p5js library file uh our own code which
27:38 - is in a file called sketch. and in those
27:40 - files we're doing some JavaScript stuff
27:43 - like making a canvas drawing a circle to
27:46 - that canvas and perhaps even as we've
27:48 - seen in previous videos making other Dom
27:51 - elements like more paragraphs and
27:54 - affecting those and changing those
27:57 - elements so you can think of uh these
28:00 - pieces as
28:01 - HTML this is really the
28:04 - structure and you could also say like
28:07 - initial content in a way like what's on
28:09 - the page when it first loads of that web
28:12 - page JavaScript is logic code things
28:16 - that can handle events store information
28:19 - make all sorts of magic happen this is
28:21 - what you can think of as the behavior of
28:23 - the page so this is where you and I and
28:27 - every body else who's doing this stuff
28:29 - is writing code to control what's
28:31 - happening on that page over time based
28:33 - on us your interaction based on some
28:35 - mathematical algorithm based on whatever
28:37 - you might fancy you like to draw
28:39 - rainbows in a canvas unicorns do that
28:42 - with JavaScript I'm adding unicorns to
28:45 - my repertoire here only was at rainbrow
28:47 - okay so um then the last piece here that
28:50 - I want to talk about is this idea of CSS
28:53 - and CSS stands for cascading style
28:56 - sheets I don't know why they're
28:58 - cascading probably has to do with some
29:00 - sort of like nesting and whatever and
29:02 - somebody on the internet who really
29:03 - knows this stuff will hopefully write in
29:05 - the comments why it's cascading but the
29:08 - keyword there is
29:10 - style so if you want to affect various
29:13 - aspects of the layout of this page you
29:16 - want the canvas to actually float on the
29:18 - right side of the page rather than the
29:19 - left side of the page you want to change
29:21 - the font that's in the paragraphs you
29:22 - want to change the background color of a
29:25 - paragraph you want to any just about
29:27 - anything that you can imagine that has
29:29 - to do with the visual look and feel of
29:31 - that page can be controlled with this
29:34 - idea of
29:35 - CSS now once again we're in the same
29:38 - place as we were with
29:40 - HTML you could write HTML into that
29:44 - index.html file or you could dynamically
29:48 - sort of insert HTML elements into the
29:51 - page using JavaScript you can write you
29:54 - can sort of in give some initial content
29:56 - you can also control those elements
29:58 - using JavaScript the same thing is true
30:00 - with CSS there is a kind of file camera
30:04 - went off there is a kind another kind of
30:06 - file you could write uh I've disappeared
30:09 - from the world but I am still here you
30:12 - cannot see me but I am still here I will
30:15 - never leave until every one last person
30:17 - on Earth actually most people on Earth
30:20 - don't really need to know about CSS or
30:21 - maybe they should I don't really know I
30:23 - I that was a terrible idea but you're
30:27 - here watching this video maybe CSS is
30:29 - useful to you I'm gonna keep going
30:32 - um the HTML file the Javascript file now
30:37 - you can also add information about
30:40 - styles to another kind of file named
30:42 - maybe style named whatever you want css.
30:45 - JS for javascript. HTML for html.
30:49 - CSS now we're in what I meant by saying
30:53 - we're in the same situation is I want to
30:54 - talk about how do you add that style
30:56 - stuff to
30:58 - style.css and then or and or how much
31:00 - you add style dynamically on the Fly
31:03 - based on user interaction based on some
31:05 - set of behaviors in JavaScript this is
31:07 - the bigger picture here and then there's
31:09 - lots of details to fill in boy am I
31:11 - rambling about this but hopefully it's
31:12 - making some sense okay so how does CSS
31:15 - work CSS works on a sing a couple
31:18 - different principles one is this idea of
31:20 - a selector so you need to have a
31:24 - selector meaning what are are the things
31:27 - that you want to select to style do you
31:30 - want to select all the paragraphs on the
31:31 - page do you want to select just this one
31:33 - particular paragraph do you want to
31:35 - select the canvas do what what Dom
31:38 - elements do you want to select in order
31:40 - to style after you say after you specify
31:43 - that selector so for example let's say
31:45 - you want to style all the paragraph
31:47 - elements on the page your selector would
31:49 - be P then you need some open and close
31:52 - curly brackets much like you always do
31:55 - when you're doing these kinds of things
31:56 - to to denote the beginning and end of
31:59 - the stuff that will the style
32:00 - information that will be applied to that
32:02 - paragraph once you have that all you
32:05 - need are a series of name value pairs
32:10 - this looks kind of like a JavaScript
32:12 - object but the syntax is a little bit
32:14 - different these name value pairs are
32:16 - like what's the property you want to
32:18 - style and what's the value for that
32:21 - style for example I want to style the
32:24 - background color and I want the
32:27 - background color to be black or white
32:31 - that's white oh I want it to be like
32:34 - pinkish F ZF so you can be asking your
32:37 - question like oh my God
32:39 - what what is that that looks terrifying
32:41 - to me there's like a pound symol and
32:43 - then a letter and then a number so
32:45 - there's a lot of things to learn this is
32:47 - a certain kind of special way of writing
32:49 - a color information you know I think
32:51 - maybe this would have been a little bit
32:53 - simpler if I just wrote the word pink
32:55 - here or purple here that would also work
32:58 - there are a variety of different ways so
33:00 - now the question is what are the kinds
33:01 - of things that can go here you know font
33:03 - size is one of them I think so if I want
33:05 - to like change the font size there's so
33:07 - much that could go here how do you know
33:09 - what the possibilities are how do you
33:11 - add that to your CSS and then how do you
33:14 - do that with JavaScript how much time do
33:17 - we have uh I'm gonna I'm gonna let's go
33:20 - to the code and look at how that some of
33:21 - this works okay I I've disappeared but
33:24 - I'm going to come back to life Sun shine
33:27 - rain down upon me and give me some light
33:29 - and have I shall appear now in front of
33:31 - the camera okay I have to turn this down
33:34 - uh okay so here I am with a p5js project
33:38 - in the p5js editor I'm going to run this
33:41 - and you can see there again we're back
33:44 - here I have this H1 element this
33:47 - paragraph element this canvas another
33:49 - paragraph element a button some of these
33:53 - elements are written here into the HTML
33:56 - body
33:57 - right in advance these are HTML elements
33:59 - that appear on the page as soon as it
34:01 - loads some of these elements are created
34:05 - with JavaScript made dynamically when
34:07 - the program runs create a paragraph
34:09 - create a button okay this is where we
34:11 - are how do I start to style let's style
34:13 - that
34:15 - paragraph Okay so actually um what I'm
34:18 - going to do even though I said over
34:21 - here uh come back even though I said
34:23 - over here you can create I'm was going
34:24 - to create a separate CSS file I'll do
34:27 - that in a later video what actually this
34:30 - buttons a little hyperactive what
34:32 - actually I think I would like to do is
34:33 - show you how you can actually add CSS
34:36 - style information directly into the HTML
34:39 - page so inside of this head tag where
34:43 - I'm referring to JavaScript files I
34:46 - could also potentially refer
34:49 - to some style information so what's that
34:53 - syntax paragraph I want to select all of
34:57 - the paragraphs on the page and assign
34:59 - them a background color which is uh
35:02 - purple I wish I could type rainbow there
35:04 - do you think it works if I type rainbow
35:06 - there I doubt it okay so now if I save
35:10 - and I run this again we can see look
35:12 - this paragraph element has a purple
35:14 - background this paragraph element has a
35:17 - purple background you know what it's
35:18 - very hard for me to see the text so I
35:20 - think if I say this color it refers to
35:24 - the color of the text inside the
35:25 - paragraph I think
35:28 - and now you can see I have white text
35:31 - with a purple background it looks a
35:33 - little crowded in there so something
35:35 - that I might add to this is some padding
35:37 - and how much padding how about eight
35:39 - pixels PX for
35:42 - Pixel so I'm going to do this and look
35:44 - ah look at this I've got some nice
35:46 - padding now so this is the basic idea of
35:49 - CSS I need to select something on the
35:52 - page and then give it some properties
35:55 - what's the property what's the value
35:56 - what's the the property what's the value
35:58 - how do you know what all these possible
35:59 - properties are well you need to look
36:01 - this stuff up you could get books you
36:03 - watch other videos that where someone
36:04 - really knows about CSS is talking about
36:06 - this but um but uh and this is where so
36:09 - so let's look for this briefly in a
36:11 - moment and I have a couple more minutes
36:14 - left uh I am going to
36:17 - um uh ah so I am on here developer.
36:22 - Mozilla um so this is one place I'll put
36:24 - some links in the description for this
36:26 - video but here is a URL of where I could
36:28 - find some information about CSS I'm
36:31 - going to remove this part
36:33 - here this is a CSS reference there's a
36:36 - tutorial there's demos uh I want to look
36:39 - at the ref an exhaustive I'm exhausted
36:42 - already an exhaustive reference I'm
36:44 - going to look at the exhaustive
36:45 - reference and I'm going to see like look
36:47 - these are all of the possible things I
36:49 - could add there's so much I just keep
36:51 - scrolling and scrolling and scrolling
36:53 - and scrolling but we can look under I
36:55 - can look for like background color and
36:57 - you can see background color is right
37:00 - over here I can click on it and what do
37:02 - I see now I see here are some examples
37:06 - of of different ways that I can call
37:08 - background color I could say red I could
37:10 - say RGB I could say current all sorts of
37:12 - ways so this is a topic for another time
37:15 - another video for you to look on your
37:17 - own there's another CSS reference that I
37:20 - like to use if I could find it in my
37:22 - history here um I think it's this one
37:25 - right so I'll include a link to this
37:27 - this is a nice reference of all sorts of
37:29 - possible uh parameters in CSS the things
37:33 - that I want to focus on in in my videos
37:36 - is less about the full encompassing of
37:39 - all of the CSS reference and more about
37:41 - two things one
37:44 - is this how how do these selectors work
37:47 - what are other ways that I could
37:48 - specifically address a single paragraph
37:50 - or only some paragraph there's a lot of
37:52 - ways you can use these selectors so I
37:53 - want to get to that and the other thing
37:55 - I want to get to is how do you do style
37:58 - dynamically in
38:00 - JavaScript so um with p5js specifically
38:04 - so let's take at least another video um
38:06 - um I'm one of my future videos I'm going
38:08 - to talk more about selectors but in this
38:10 - particular video I want to look at the
38:12 - style
38:13 - function so here if I come back if I
38:17 - quit Chrome for a second and I come back
38:18 - to this we can see that these particular
38:23 - elements now these paragraph elements
38:25 - are all styled
38:27 - based on the hardcoded style information
38:29 - that's in the HTML file inside of the
38:31 - style tags but another thing I can do is
38:36 - right over here I can for any HTM any
38:40 - element that I create with P5 and later
38:43 - I'm going to show you any element that I
38:44 - access in P5 whether it was created or
38:46 - not I can call a function called
38:50 - style which then requires just two
38:55 - arguments what are those arguments the
38:58 - name of the style property the value of
39:00 - the style property so if I were to put
39:02 - right here in quotes background- color
39:07 - and then I were to say in here in quotes
39:12 - pink you can see look at this this
39:15 - particular element is still getting the
39:17 - style from the HTML page this particular
39:20 - element whop I'm not
39:23 - there uh this particular element that
39:26 - down here is getting the style from my
39:28 - code so the when I apply a piece of
39:31 - styling dynamically in code uh it's
39:34 - going to overwrite the style that was
39:36 - originally set up in the HTML page so
39:38 - there's a lot of pieces here and for you
39:40 - essentially if you're following these
39:42 - videos along what I would suggest you do
39:44 - is try adding some style to the HTML
39:46 - file in the same
39:49 - way that I did here try adding some
39:52 - Styles this way what other tags might
39:55 - you reference try adding some Styles
39:58 - this way what happens if you add styles
40:00 - to other kinds of elements that aren't
40:02 - just paragraph elements and lastly and
40:04 - I'll do this for you really quickly set
40:07 - something style with an event okay let's
40:10 - think about this for example what if I
40:12 - say uh what if I were to say button.
40:16 - mous
40:18 - pressed change style right so now I am
40:24 - attaching the change style event to the
40:27 - Press of this button and what is that
40:29 - change style event it's a function that
40:32 - I need to write right the code inside
40:35 - this function right here will execute
40:37 - when I click the mouse on that button
40:39 - and maybe I'll change the text style to
40:43 - Pink and maybe I'll give it a lot more
40:47 - padding because who doesn't love padding
40:51 - jazz hands I don't know feel like that's
40:53 - going to be that's JavaScript the
40:55 - musical that's my first song who doesn't
40:56 - love
40:59 - padding you with me on that okay uh so
41:02 - now if we look at this everything's got
41:04 - its default style I'm going to trigger
41:06 - that event I got some more padding and
41:09 - uh a pink background so and you know
41:11 - maybe what I want to do I just I got to
41:13 - do a little bit more say text Mouse over
41:16 - change style oops and then uh I'll say
41:22 - button I'll say text Mouse out revert
41:28 - Style and what I can do here and I'm
41:31 - going to I'm just showing you some other
41:33 - things
41:34 - uh revert
41:37 - style and background purple
41:41 - padding eight pixels so let's take out
41:44 - the button event for a second I'm using
41:45 - Mouse out and mouse over I Mouse over I
41:48 - Mouse out I Mouse over I Mouse out I
41:50 - Mouse over that's a very rhythmic um so
41:53 - you can see here that you can start to
41:55 - highlight things make things happen
41:57 - based on button presses based on Mouse
41:59 - over bouse out based on the movement of
42:00 - a slider as we saw in the previous video
42:03 - so many possibilities so now you have
42:05 - something to work with try adding some
42:07 - style to the HTML page try adding some
42:10 - style using the style function see what
42:13 - types of elements what types of designs
42:14 - you can make and I'm going to come back
42:16 - and look at this again and again and
42:17 - again in several videos looking at other
42:19 - different types of scenarios with more
42:21 - events and more ways of selecting
42:23 - Elements which uh classes and IDs is the
42:26 - topic for that and just as a reminder uh
42:29 - go and look in those references that'll
42:30 - be linked below as to where you can find
42:32 - all this stuff so I'm 5 minutes over
42:34 - time not that that is relevant to you
42:35 - especially if you're watching this
42:37 - sometime in the future like in the year
42:39 - 2000 that was a while ago I guess but in
42:42 - my my childhood the year 2000 seemed
42:44 - like very far away uh the year 3000 is
42:47 - anybody watching this if you're watching
42:48 - this the year 3000 please go and get my
42:50 - brain out of that cryogenic thing that
42:52 - it's
42:53 - in and I don't know yeah
42:57 - do something with it talk to me about
42:59 - rainbows okay goodbye and I'll see you
43:01 - in a future
43:03 - video I have toit stop now okay live
43:06 - stream I don't know if that came across
43:07 - and worked uh anybody there's some
43:11 - discussion here uh so thanks for I I've
43:14 - got to go unfortunately I'm going to try
43:16 - to do some more live streams as soon as
43:17 - I have some more time I've got a whole
43:19 - long list of Dom manipulation videos to
43:22 - make and also I um
43:27 - I have a whole bunch from this morning
43:28 - that I need to upload and correct
43:30 - because there were some problems in them
43:31 - so goodbye for now please be in touch
43:34 - and uh I hope to see you all again in
43:37 - this weird strange context that is this
43:39 - live streaming
43:41 - thing uh okay how do I stop
43:44 - this
43:46 - um I wonder if I just hit settings here
43:51 - no oh wait look I'll play an ad who
43:53 - wants to watch an ad while I wait to
43:55 - figure out how to stop
43:56 - I won't do the ad right now the stream
43:58 - is public advanced settings maybe I'm
44:01 - just supposed to stop it from clicking a
44:03 - button in wirecast so I'm going to do
44:05 - that okay I'm going to click this button
44:06 - it's definitely going to shut off
44:07 - goodbye
