00:00 - hello and welcome back to another video
00:02 - in Chapter two the nature of code about
00:05 - forces so the last video I look at it
00:07 - friction and modeling friction and in
00:08 - this video I want to look at a drag
00:10 - force which is quite similar to friction
00:12 - but also different isn't that that's why
00:14 - I'm looking at it but what I'm really
00:16 - doing here in these in these four
00:18 - wrap-up videos to chapter two is it's
00:20 - taking doing some case studies what are
00:22 - formulas that you might find in a
00:24 - textbook or Wikipedia that you just sort
00:26 - of like feel like I'll order those mean
00:27 - how do I even use that try to unpack
00:29 - those formulas and apply them even code
00:31 - so the case study that this video will
00:34 - examine is drag drag force sometimes
00:37 - called air resistance it's a kind of
00:39 - friction and it's part of the field of
00:42 - study of fluid dynamics and there's all
00:43 - sorts of interesting fluid simulation
00:46 - crazy stuff you could do and there's
00:47 - lift and all sorts of a lot you could
00:52 - get into but I'm gonna spoil things down
00:55 - and try to look at this particular
00:59 - formula for calculating a drag force I
01:03 - brought that formula right here into the
01:05 - nature of code book and this is what I'm
01:08 - going to use so let's come over to the
01:09 - white board and replace the friction
01:11 - formula
01:12 - [Music]
01:17 - this is the formula we want to implement
01:20 - and the context of what implemented in
01:22 - is a two dimensional p5 canvas where we
01:27 - have a body that's moving with a current
01:30 - velocity point it down once again we're
01:32 - calculating a force so we need to both
01:35 - determine the direction of the force and
01:37 - the magnitude let's start with direction
01:41 - identical to friction is the direction
01:43 - of drag we have the velocity unit vector
01:46 - and negative 1/2 so the drag force
01:50 - points in the opposite direction of
01:53 - velocity so that's something we already
01:55 - know how to do it's scaled with this
01:57 - negative 1/2 because you know science
01:59 - but to us in our p5 world whether this
02:02 - is negative 1/2 or 5 it's gonna be less
02:04 - important because this is made-up units
02:05 - of measurement anyway then we have to
02:07 - start looking at other aspects of this
02:10 - let's go through these one at a time so
02:13 - this Greek letter Rho is stands for
02:17 - density so what is this moving through
02:20 - well if I were to take this marker and
02:22 - drop it there would be air resistance
02:23 - it's moving through a gas the air so
02:25 - what is the density of the air versus if
02:27 - it landed in water what's the density of
02:28 - the water versus mud or jello or
02:30 - whatever kind of thing it's moving
02:31 - through in our p5 world assuming this
02:33 - circle his body is moving through a kind
02:35 - of homogeneous uniform space it's all
02:37 - the same stuff the density of this air
02:40 - or fluid or whatever it is is a constant
02:43 - so Rho the density is a constant
02:46 - skipping V squared for a second let's go
02:50 - to a so a this is surface area so if I
02:52 - come back to the diagram in the nature
02:54 - of code book we can see here the idea is
02:56 - what is the surface area of the object
02:58 - coming into contact with the fluid and
03:01 - you can think of it like is it
03:02 - aerodynamic or not does it come with
03:04 - like a to a sharp point where there's a
03:06 - very little surface area or is it kind
03:07 - of like a wide load and there's a lot of
03:10 - surface area moving through this fluid
03:12 - oh wow this is something I absolutely
03:14 - could try to model based on thinking
03:17 - about different shapes and different
03:19 - sizes of those shapes I could also just
03:21 - consider that a constant and maybe I'll
03:23 - just say all of the objects in my world
03:25 - come in with a surface area of one but
03:26 - I'm really just going to consider this
03:28 - to be a constant so if I were to mana it
03:31 - might make the ultimate simulation more
03:33 - dynamic and more realistic but it's one
03:35 - thing that I think it's a detail that I
03:37 - can mostly ignore especially if I have a
03:38 - lot of circular bodies of relative
03:40 - similar-sized then we have the
03:43 - coefficient of drag itself what's that
03:45 - that's a constant it's a constant it's a
03:49 - constant that maps to the relative
03:51 - strength of the drag force itself what
03:53 - I'm saying is all of these these three
03:55 - elements with this negative 1/2 which is
03:58 - literally a constant I could consider to
04:00 - be a constant in my simulation so I can
04:04 - actually take this formula and simplify
04:06 - it greatly drag force is equal to
04:11 - negative 1 times some constant I'll call
04:14 - that the coefficient of drag it's in a
04:16 - queue it's a constant that takes into
04:18 - account the negative 1/2 the surface
04:21 - area the density and the coefficient of
04:23 - drag times V squared times the unit
04:28 - vector V so once again the direction is
04:31 - in the opposite direction of velocity
04:33 - and it's scaled according to some
04:35 - constant times and this one is really
04:37 - important this is the speed squared it's
04:40 - the magnitude of the velocity vector and
04:42 - this is key those faster the object this
04:45 - was not the case with friction not the
04:47 - case with kinetic friction doesn't
04:49 - matter how fast the object was moving
04:50 - the friction force is proportional
04:52 - proportional to that speed but in the
04:54 - case of drag it's absolutely
04:56 - proportional if I were to hold this
04:59 - marker absolutely still it's not moving
05:02 - at all there is no drag force on it but
05:06 - if it's moving very very fast that drag
05:08 - force will be stronger it's moving
05:10 - slowly it'll be weaker and that's
05:12 - absolutely wanna model so we want the
05:13 - magnitude of this vector squared in our
05:16 - formula I should also note that another
05:17 - way that you might see another notation
05:19 - for writing the magnitude of the vector
05:21 - is the name of the vector with two bars
05:23 - along each side so you could also could
05:25 - also rewrite this formula like this to
05:27 - demonstrate how to implement this I'm
05:29 - taking a exact duplicate of the code I
05:31 - wrote in the previous video
05:32 - demonstrating friction and all I've done
05:34 - here is I've renamed the friction
05:36 - function and I'm calling it
05:38 - so what are elements is there anything
05:40 - here that I want to keep well actually
05:42 - there is one thing that I want to keep
05:43 - which is that I want to when I'm getting
05:46 - the direction of the vector
05:48 - I want negative one times the velocity
05:50 - unit vector so this is what I want to
05:56 - keep I want the direction now of the
05:57 - drag force and I've got it here in this
06:02 - variable called drag what's next
06:05 - I need the magnitude of the drag force
06:07 - speed squared times the coefficient of
06:10 - drag well let's make up a coefficient
06:12 - let's call it zero point one the speed
06:16 - is this dot velocity dot mag and then
06:19 - set the drags magnitude to C times speed
06:22 - and apply the force this is actually
06:26 - quite incorrect
06:27 - remember it's not proportional to the
06:30 - speed it's proportional to the speed
06:32 - squared V times speed guess what though
06:35 - there's actually a function in p5 called
06:38 - mag squared for magnitude squared so
06:40 - it'll be a little bit more efficient if
06:42 - I just call this like speed squared and
06:44 - use the magnitude squared function we
06:47 - can see that these objects that have
06:48 - less mass have a more difficult time
06:50 - accelerating let's see what happens if I
06:52 - take C and make it like a really high
06:54 - number like 5 you can see this all of
06:57 - these are like really having trouble
06:59 - moving they're just like slower if I
07:02 - make it like 500 can I get them just
07:04 - like the force to be so strong that they
07:06 - don't move whoa so one thing I really
07:08 - have to watch out for that force could
07:10 - become so strong it will actually push
07:12 - them back up in the opposite direction
07:13 - and which wouldn't actually happen but
07:16 - you know again with all the various
07:18 - inaccuracies of things that I'm doing I
07:19 - probably need to put some constraints on
07:20 - this but with something like a
07:22 - coefficient of drag of like 0.1 in this
07:24 - context with that I'm getting kind of
07:27 - realistic behavior but I really want to
07:28 - emphasize this in in a sort of more
07:30 - meaningful way so I think what I'm going
07:32 - to do is consider half of the canvas to
07:35 - have like a liquid and a thick liquid
07:38 - that has a strong drag to its rack
07:41 - coefficient and the other half to be
07:42 - Bisley a vacuum with no drag so let's
07:45 - draw it go to the canvas and draw a
07:47 - rectangle let's say fill 255 with an
07:50 - alpha of 50
07:51 - a rectangle and we can make it even a
07:56 - little bit brighter okay so I want to
08:01 - draw on half of the canvas this
08:03 - rectangle that shows sort of like as if
08:05 - these objects are falling and land in
08:07 - water or land in some liquid so in this
08:10 - case I'll just say if mover dot position
08:15 - dot y is greater than height divided by
08:18 - 2 mover drag so we should now see them
08:24 - all fall at the exact same rate but once
08:28 - they hit the water the fluid resistance
08:30 - will affect them differently
08:33 - pause dot y let's make that drag force
08:39 - even a little bit stronger oh look at
08:47 - that see that's the issue if it's too
08:49 - strong you can see it's kind of like
08:51 - that's not very realistic
08:53 - it's like bouncing it's like bouncing
08:55 - off of it which is kind of like a weird
08:56 - this is sort of fun a little like bug
08:59 - it's a feature not a bug but obviously
09:01 - it doesn't feel very at realistic maybe
09:04 - it might make sense for me to have this
09:05 - like drag coefficient be a global
09:09 - variable and actually perhaps even it's
09:11 - something that gets passed in to the
09:13 - function itself let's make it point to
09:21 - so this wraps up this particular example
09:24 - to demonstrating a drag force here's
09:27 - some exercises of things you could try
09:28 - one is I'm not being very thoughtful
09:30 - about how I'm considering the
09:32 - two-dimensional space that is the canvas
09:34 - I just kind of used height divided by
09:36 - two as this arbitrary marker between
09:38 - vacuum and liquid maybe I would actually
09:41 - want to create a liquid class an object
09:44 - that describes a density a coefficient
09:48 - and a area of the canvas where that
09:50 - liquid or gas is present and then I
09:52 - could build a map right of having
09:54 - different liquids with different
09:55 - coefficients and different parts and
09:57 - have a much more dynamic system of
09:59 - things experiencing different amounts of
10:00 - drag depending on where they are and
10:02 - maybe it's all color coded there's lots
10:04 - of possibilities there
10:05 - another thing that I might consider
10:06 - what's is thinking about surface area
10:09 - here I'm assuming that all of the
10:11 - objects have the same surface area which
10:12 - isn't true and I can visually see that
10:14 - they don't and there's probably at least
10:16 - a very basic way that I can consider the
10:19 - size and have that be a factor in how I
10:21 - calculate the magnitude of a drag force
10:23 - so that's definitely you would something
10:24 - I would suggest trying as well so let me
10:26 - know if you have questions about this
10:28 - particularly implementation
10:29 - try to make your own version of it think
10:31 - about just even the sort of like visual
10:32 - design interaction of the system but
10:34 - also what kinds of adjustments could you
10:36 - make to how the drag force behaves and
10:38 - what types of results might you get from
10:40 - that and go to the coding training com
10:42 - where you can share your versions of
10:43 - this particular example and I've got one
10:45 - more chapter to video to make where I'm
10:48 - gonna look at the formula for
10:49 - gravitational attraction and look at
10:51 - orbiting orbiting bodies see you there
10:54 - [Music]
11:02 - you
