00:00 - (ding)
- Hello.
00:01 - So, previously, I made a bot
00:03 - that picked a random
number between zero and 90,
00:07 - generated this fractal
tree using that angle,
00:10 - using processing, made the image,
00:12 - and then posted that image to Mastodon
00:14 - using this coding train
bot at bots in space,
00:17 - bots in dot space, whatever,
botsinspace.instance.
00:21 - So, you can see a bunch of these here.
00:23 - And so, now what I want to do...
00:26 - And the bot, if we look at the code,
00:28 - is just executing all of this stuff
00:32 - to generate the image
and post it once a day.
00:35 - So, what I would like to do now
00:37 - in this video is change it.
00:40 - Well, I'm not going to use setInterval.
00:42 - In fact, I'm not ever
going to post an image.
00:47 - I am only going to post an image
00:49 - as a reply to somebody else.
00:51 - And I'm going to look in their reply,
00:53 - find the angle that they have specified,
00:55 - and send them back a tree with that angle.
00:58 - And you can just imagine
00:59 - the possibilities of things you can do.
01:01 - I mean, one of my favorites,
this is a Twitter bot,
01:03 - but one of my favorite
bots is Lowpoly Bot.
01:06 - And what Lowpoly Bot does is,
01:08 - is it still running, is the question.
01:09 - 'Cause most of these bots you can't...
01:11 - One of the reasons why I'm using Mastodon
01:14 - is that you can't really run
these anymore on Twitter.
01:17 - They've changed the API
specifications too much.
01:20 - So, the idea is that,
you send in an image,
01:23 - and an image processes for
you and sends it back, okay.
01:25 - So, I want to connect
to the streaming API,
01:28 - and I want to connect to the user stream,
01:31 - meaning any time I get
any sort of notification,
01:33 - somebody favorites something,
somebody mentions me,
01:35 - re blogs me, if I post something,
I think I get an event,
01:39 - so the way that I do that
is by saying M.stream.
01:43 - Right, I have to go look
it up here in this API.
01:49 - M.stream path and parameters.
01:52 - Returns a stream listener instance.
01:53 - See examples how how to use it.
01:55 - Okay, why not?
01:56 - I've done this already
in a previous video.
01:58 - So, I could look at my previous code.
02:00 - But let's actually...
02:01 - Sorry, let's just go to
examples, streaming.js.
02:05 - Oh, and we can see that here.
02:06 - So, this is what I want to do,
I want to connect to the stream.
02:10 - Create a stream instance.
02:13 - All right, connecting to streaming/user.
02:15 - And then, on a particular event,
02:18 - like a notification, is that what it was?
02:21 - Oh no, just a message.
02:23 - So the event here is called message.
02:25 - And then, on a message...
02:28 - And this by the way, I've just been told
02:31 - from the chat, thank
you to Alca in the chat,
02:33 - that the streaming API
doesn't support promises.
02:37 - So in this case, I do
have to use a call back
02:39 - and I can say response, I
like to use the word response,
02:44 - like this.
02:46 - Now I do want to look up my previous code
02:48 - 'cause I need to figure out what,
02:49 - I need to determine what I'm
looking for in that response.
02:52 - So I have that open here
02:53 - and you can see that what I'm doing here
02:55 - is if the event is a notification
02:58 - and if it's a mention,
that's what I'm looking for.
03:01 - I'm looking for a mention.
03:02 - So I'm going to say if
response.event equals a notification.
03:11 - I'm just only going to do mentions.
03:13 - And response.data.type
I think equals mention.
03:19 - Is that right?
03:20 - I should be just looking
at my previous code.
03:22 - Message .data.type.
03:25 - Message .event.
03:26 - So where is the mention
in this one that I did?
03:31 - Do do do do do.
03:34 - Ah, message .data, it's right there.
03:36 - Message .data.type so I'm
using different variable names,
03:38 - which is fine, but if the
event is a notification
03:41 - and the type of the event is a mention,
03:44 - then, now, I am ready
to basically do this.
03:48 - The idea is if I'm mentioned,
go ahead and do this.
03:51 - But, and I don't need a
separate function for this.
03:56 - So I'm just going to take this here.
03:58 - But, what I want to do
04:01 - is I need to add some stuff to this.
04:03 - So for example, I probably want to mention
04:07 - a user account and I
want to have a reply id
04:13 - and also that angle.
04:14 - So I need to, if I'm going to reply,
04:17 - I want to at mention them,
so I need their account
04:20 - to reference.
04:22 - Also, if I want it to be threaded,
04:23 - I need the id of that post
04:26 - so I can include that,
and then the angle I want.
04:29 - So now the angle shouldn't come,
04:31 - oh I've got to send the
angle in to processing.
04:33 - Alright, that's going to be
something we have to figure out.
04:36 - Okay, I'm going to get
to that in a second.
04:38 - So let's try to get the
whole flow of this working.
04:41 - This is an interesting problem
04:42 - that I completely forgot
that I had to figure out.
04:44 - So first, let me get the id is,
04:49 - and I did this before,
so I'm just going to,
04:52 - we can see the id is this.
04:55 - This is pulling the id out of,
04:57 - and I said response instead
of message, which is fine.
05:01 - And then the account name is right here.
05:04 - So I want to also get the account,
05:06 - which is also response.
05:07 - So I can then pass on the account,
05:09 - pass on the id, now the
angle is a tricky one.
05:12 - So what am I expecting the person to say?
05:15 - I guess I'm expecting
somewhere in their post
05:18 - that there's a number.
05:19 - And they could put multiple numbers,
05:24 - I'm just going to pick the first number.
05:25 - So what I'm going to do, whoops.
05:26 - This is by the way my
inspiration, the tree bot.
05:29 - But where am I?
05:30 - I'm looking at my code.
05:31 - I need to get the content
of what they've sent me.
05:33 - This is their message content.
05:35 - So what I want to do is
use a regular expression.
05:39 - So my regular expression is going to be
05:42 - I need to find a number.
05:44 - The number that I want is
between two and three digits.
05:48 - So I guess I'm going to allow...
05:49 - I mean, do I allow an
angle greater than 90?
05:52 - I mean, sure.
05:53 - I could actually, it could be any number.
05:56 - I could really just say any number.
05:58 - It doesn't matter how big.
06:00 - So I want to match this.
06:01 - And so if I say regular...
06:04 - Oh, if I say content.match
regular expression.
06:08 - Is this--
06:09 - Now I've forgotten how
regular expressions work.
06:12 - So let's just go to the
browser for a second
06:15 - and let's noodle around here.
06:17 - So let's say if I make
a regular expression
06:20 - and I make it equal to this,
06:23 - and then I have a string
06:24 - like hello 42 goodbye.
06:31 - If I saw s.match that regular expression,
06:35 - what do I get?
06:36 - Ah, perfect.
06:38 - I get what it matched, the
index, and some more information.
06:41 - All I care about is what it matched.
06:43 - And I don't need it to be global.
06:44 - I don't need it to get all the numbers.
06:45 - I could get all the numbers
and average them or something.
06:48 - But I'm just going to get the first one.
06:49 - So this is fine.
06:50 - So then I'm going to...
06:52 - And I do have to deal with the fact,
06:54 - what if it doesn't match anything?
06:55 - So let's see what it gives
me if it doesn't match.
06:57 - So let's say s equals this.
07:00 - And I'm going to say s
match regular expression.
07:02 - Null, so that's fine.
07:03 - So now I'm going to say
results equals content
07:09 - match regular expression and the angle,
07:13 - so I'm going to say if results,
07:15 - or I could,
07:16 - if results, I could probably
use that ternary thing.
07:18 - Then the angle equals results index zero,
07:27 - otherwise angle equals,
07:32 - oh otherwise I'm going
to say there's no angle.
07:33 - I could reply and say you need
to mention me with a number.
07:37 - So I'll...
07:40 - So I'm actually going to just say,
07:42 - yeah, angle equals negative one.
07:46 - So I'm going to use
negative one as like a...
07:50 - And I can actually just do this
07:55 - and then do this, okay.
07:57 - Great great great great great.
07:58 - So now in theory, now I
can pass that angle here.
08:03 - So alright, now one thing I can do.
08:05 - Let's just do this.
08:07 - So if, the first thing I want to do
08:09 - is just say if angle equals negative one,
08:13 - right, if I've gotten
a negative one angle,
08:16 - I want to actually
08:20 - just be done.
08:22 - Like I want to say...
08:24 - Oh but I have to mention the person.
08:26 - Okay, so I have to say
08:29 - if in a status post,
08:31 - can I find that here?
08:33 - Right, so the text of the status
08:35 - is this text of the status in reply to id,
08:38 - so this is important.
08:39 - So I'm going to say...
08:46 - Please specify an angle
in degrees using digits.
08:53 - 'Cause it won't work if
you say the word ninety.
08:56 - Then I need to say
08:58 - in reply, what is it?
09:01 - In reply to id, in reply
to id is that reply id.
09:07 - And then also
09:10 - I want to use the account.
09:12 - So I'm going to, I want
to start with the account.
09:16 - Account, and do I say at?
09:18 - I think I have to say at the account.
09:21 - Please specify an angle in digits.
09:24 - Then in reply to id.
09:25 - Okay, so this is good and I'll call this,
09:29 - and then I'm going to say
09:32 - response,
09:34 - I'm going to say params and response
09:36 - and success, angle, negative one.
09:39 - Okay, so this now should...
09:43 - If I run this...
09:46 - And then I'm going to put an else here.
09:50 - This function has gotten quite long.
09:54 - But basically what I'm doing
09:57 - is first I'm checking if
there was a legitimate angle.
09:59 - And if there wasn't,
I'm replying back to say
10:02 - please specify an angle in degrees
10:04 - and then let's see how that goes.
10:06 - So right now if I run this bot,
10:10 - oh I forgot to make a new one.
10:11 - That's fine.
10:12 - If I run this bot,
somebody should feel free
10:15 - to at mention me
10:17 - without a digit.
10:19 - Can somebody do that please?
10:20 - Alright, somebody at messaged me,
10:22 - thank you for helping me debug this.
10:25 - And I got an error in bot.js line 25.
10:28 - Bot.js line 25, ah,
response, response, response.
10:34 - Sorry!
10:36 - Response, response, alright
let's try this again.
10:38 - Be prepared.
10:41 - Alright, at mention me
with no number please.
10:43 - You can put a number in
it, but it won't work
10:45 - if you put a number in it.
10:46 - Alright, oo!
10:49 - Interesting.
10:50 - Can someone please?
10:51 - There we go, okay.
10:52 - So let's take a look,
10:53 - so someone mentioned me with a number.
10:55 - That's great that we had
both of those tested.
10:57 - And we can see this one
11:00 - said please specify an angle
in degrees using digits.
11:03 - That's right.
11:04 - And then this one
11:06 - just said behold my beautiful tree.
11:07 - So I haven't done the thing
where I actually get the angle.
11:09 - So let's first, let's just first
11:14 - if I really do get an angle,
11:16 - let's do all the same steps
11:20 - but right now, I'm going to also add
11:25 - at account, so I'm going
to mention that account
11:30 - with angle, and then I'm going to use
11:34 - the angle that they asked for
11:39 - and then, and I need in reply id.
11:43 - What was it?
11:44 - Same thing.
11:45 - In reply to id.
11:48 - Where is that, where
is that, where is that?
11:50 - There we go.
11:51 - In reply to id.
11:53 - Okay.
11:54 - So now, if I run this one more time,
11:58 - you can now at mention me with an angle
12:02 - and you'll get a tree back.
12:03 - Or you can at mention me with no angle
12:06 - and you will get a message
back saying you need an angle.
12:08 - But, I won't be using the
angle you asked for just yet.
12:12 - But let's just see if this works.
12:14 - Okay great, so we can see that we got
12:16 - one two three four five mentions,
12:18 - one of which had a negative one.
12:20 - So let's see, let's just check our bot now
12:24 - and we can see 60, 38,
56, now here's the thing.
12:28 - I'm not actually using the angle,
12:29 - it's still just a random angle.
12:32 - (laughing)
12:32 - So, what I need to do is...
12:37 - Oh and I forgot that I
was pulling it out of here
12:39 - so it's actually not, hold on.
12:40 - Let's...
12:42 - So we see Alca asked for 56
and I made a tree with 52.
12:47 - So now let's take this out
12:50 - and actually try to use that angle.
12:52 - Now here's the thing.
12:53 - I can't just...
12:54 - How do I do this?
12:56 - So what I'm actually going to do,
12:58 - this is interesting,
12:59 - is I need to go back to that exec command.
13:02 - Where did I have that?
13:04 - Where is that?
13:04 - Oh, command.
13:06 - So that's, whoa, it's
all the way way up here.
13:09 - So what I actually need to do
13:10 - is I need to add another argument to this.
13:13 - And so what I'm going to do,
13:16 - and I think,
13:17 - I haven't done this in a while.
13:19 - Let's, alright, let's
do it this way, sorry.
13:21 - Let me grab this command.
13:24 - We're going to figure this out together.
13:28 - And we go back to here.
13:30 - And I'm going to run that command.
13:32 - So this runs and that spits out the angle.
13:35 - Now there should be a way in processing
13:39 - for me to get the arguments.
13:43 - How do you get the arguments in Java?
13:46 - Okay, I looked it up,
13:47 - I can't believe I forgot this.
13:49 - But processing actually just has
13:54 - a build in variable called args
13:55 - which has those command line arguments.
13:57 - So I'm going to put printArray args
14:00 - and now I'm going to do this.
14:02 - And we should see
14:04 - whoa!
14:05 - Oh, it's null 'cause there were none.
14:08 - That's weird.
14:09 - Because where do those go?
14:14 - They're not here.
14:15 - How do I pass arguments?
14:16 - If I just add something else like here?
14:20 - Oh yeah, there we go, okay.
14:21 - So if I just add, the
args come at the end.
14:24 - I thought some of these might be args,
14:25 - but of course there's none.
14:26 - So we can see here if I just
execute it with an argument
14:30 - like with the angle 40,
14:32 - then, bleh 40 'cause I have some...
14:38 - I had a bl in there.
14:38 - Bleh 40 comes out.
14:40 - Okay, perfect, this is
much easier than I thought.
14:42 - All I need to do is now say command.
14:46 - Where do I execute that command?
14:48 - Right here.
14:50 - Execute command plus
14:54 - space angle, right?
14:58 - I guess I could use a
template literal there.
14:59 - But just need to add that angle there
15:02 - and I probably want to
double check to make sure
15:05 - there are any args, but if
args is not equal to null,
15:11 - then...
15:13 - And then I'm going to make
this a global variable.
15:15 - A equals zero.
15:18 - And then I'm going to say
a equals args index zero.
15:21 - I guess that's going
to be a string, right?
15:23 - So I need to convert that to an integer
15:26 - or a float maybe.
15:28 - And then I don't need it here.
15:31 - And now here we go.
15:32 - So now, if...
15:35 - Let's take out the exit just so we see.
15:40 - Let's do this.
15:42 - Processing java.
15:43 - Run with the angle 10.
15:47 - That looks like the angle 10 right?
15:49 - Now, let's run with an angle of 90.
15:54 - And that looks like the angle 90!
15:56 - (clap)
Perfect!
15:56 - I passed in the angle.
15:58 - And so now I should be able to...
16:00 - I mean right, is there
anything left to do?
16:02 - I think this works.
16:04 - 'Cause I got the angle, I got the angle,
16:06 - I'm going to give it the angle,
16:09 - yeah, alright.
16:11 - What the hey ho?
16:13 - Let's run this.
16:16 - Ha!
16:19 - Node bot.js, Mastodon Bot starting.
16:22 - And now, I'll just wait for a little bit.
16:24 - (jazzy music)
16:27 - Try test anything you can imagine.
16:29 - Oh woops!
16:30 - Sorry stop, stop!
16:34 - It's funny.
16:34 - Actually, this is fine
I forgot the exit thing.
16:42 - So amusingly I forgot the exit thing
16:44 - so it's opening up processing
16:45 - but it's never finishing.
16:46 - So actually that exit
thing is very important
16:50 - because I forgot that I had that in there.
16:53 - I've got to put that back in there.
16:56 - And let's try this one more time.
16:58 - And here we go.
17:00 - (jazzy music)
17:05 - Alright, thank you everybody,
17:06 - this looks like some
good amount of testing.
17:08 - Let's go now to bots in space
17:10 - and take a look.
17:11 - Here is, behold my tree
with an angle of 90,
17:15 - please specify an angle,
so we can see here,
17:18 - nope, right that worked.
17:20 - Here, a right triangle has
an angle of 90 degrees.
17:22 - I love right triangles.
17:23 - There we go, perfect.
17:24 - So, 89, and there we go.
17:28 - 128 degrees.
17:30 - 128, this is working!
17:32 - Yay!
17:33 - (trumpet fanfare)
17:33 - This is done!
17:34 - So I hope now you have enjoyed,
17:36 - you can imagine sort of...
17:37 - I mean there is another piece
to this that I could do,
17:39 - which is what if the
person sends me an image
17:43 - and I do something to the
image and send it back.
17:45 - I guess I'll have to come back another day
17:46 - and do that one.
17:47 - But now you can see the full process
17:50 - that you can have another
user at mention you
17:53 - with some data, text data,
17:56 - use that text data to generate an image,
17:58 - and send it back.
17:58 - So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial,
18:00 - I hope you make some wonderful
bots at bots in space
18:03 - and I will see you in a future video.
