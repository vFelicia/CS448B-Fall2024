00:00 - hello this is another video in my series
00:03 - about Chrome extensions which you know
00:06 - right now I just want to say at the
00:08 - beginning of this video I hope to
00:09 - actually turn this playlist into
00:12 - something that's instead of saying
00:13 - Chrome extensions just say browser
00:14 - extensions because that is something
00:17 - that is quite possible beyond simply the
00:18 - browser Chrome but I'm gonna stick with
00:20 - Chrome right now as I work through all
00:22 - the details so what am I going to add in
00:25 - this particular video well as you can
00:28 - see here in my diagram I can't see over
00:32 - there anymore my monitor is now blocked
00:34 - by something else as you can see in my
00:35 - diagram here I have talked about content
00:37 - scripts and background scripts and what
00:39 - I'm going to add today is something
00:41 - called a pop-up so a pop-up is a page
00:46 - that you can launch that's essentially
00:48 - like an overlay of what's what's in the
00:51 - browser at the certain and a certain
00:52 - moment and I can launch it via a browser
00:55 - action for example clicking a button
00:58 - that I have in the top over here I can
01:00 - press that button and I can have some
01:02 - sort of pop-up come up so I could do
01:04 - things like I could have an interface
01:06 - where I could change colors or make
01:08 - selections or type in a word that I want
01:10 - to look up I could augment the browsing
01:13 - experience through a separate pop-up
01:15 - page that is that as part of my Chrome
01:17 - extension so that's what we're gonna
01:19 - make
01:19 - in this tutorial okay so what I'm gonna
01:22 - do is I'm gonna start with the code that
01:24 - I had at the end of my background script
01:26 - tutorial which if we look at already
01:29 - made a copy of it into a new folder
01:31 - which I'm calling pop-ups which you can
01:33 - find a link to this code for this
01:35 - tutorial in the description as usual and
01:38 - what I'm what i have is that
01:40 - manifest.json file so i've already
01:42 - changed it to coding train extension 3
01:44 - maybe I'll say you know all changes the
01:46 - coding train pop-up it is like the
01:50 - content script is available for all URLs
01:53 - in the background strip now
01:55 - interestingly enough I actually don't
01:56 - need a background script just have a
01:59 - pop-up like I might need a background
02:00 - script for something else that's going
02:01 - on in my extension but I don't need it
02:03 - just for the pop-up so I think just for
02:04 - simplicity in this particular tutorial
02:06 - I'm gonna take out the background script
02:08 - and I'm actually going to just delete
02:11 - the file that is the background
02:12 - actually you know what I'm gonna leave
02:13 - it there because eventually one thing
02:16 - that I'm gonna want to do is if you
02:18 - recall a way that I sent a message the
02:22 - way that I controlled the content script
02:24 - or made an event happen the contract
02:26 - script from the background script was
02:28 - sending a message and actually what I
02:30 - probably going to want to do now is send
02:31 - a message from the pop-up to the content
02:33 - script so the code that's in the
02:34 - background script is going to become
02:36 - useful for me because I can use that
02:37 - same code in the pop-up alright so but
02:42 - when there's a browser action I want
02:45 - there to be something more I want there
02:47 - to be a default pop-up no it's not
02:53 - written over there what I'm supposed to
02:54 - type right here I just looked over there
02:56 - because there was something interesting
02:57 - happening I'm putting notes over there
03:00 - and I want this to be now can I make
03:03 - that in another folder let's try this
03:06 - and I want to try to do is make the
03:07 - pop-up of entire Pete let's actually
03:09 - first just make it an HTML page so I'm
03:12 - gonna just call it pop-up HTML and I
03:16 - think I need to say oh I don't need to
03:18 - but I can say default I know and this
03:23 - will appear in like the tooltips like a
03:25 - pop-up will come here alright so I think
03:30 - that is now some stuff that I can add to
03:34 - now have a pop-up now what this means is
03:37 - there needs to be an HTML page called
03:38 - pop-up that HTML so I'm gonna make that
03:40 - file pop-up dot HTML and I'm just gonna
03:44 - I mean I should I don't really know you
03:47 - need all this stuff in the HTML page but
03:49 - let's just put basically like something
03:51 - really basic there right now just to say
03:54 - like hello I know uh choo choo okay so
04:02 - this is this page I want to see pop-up
04:04 - when I press that button in the browser
04:06 - okay here we go
04:08 - so now what do I need to do remember I
04:11 - need to load the code and to load that
04:13 - extension Oh five pop-ups this is the
04:15 - one I'm gonna select a whole folder I'm
04:17 - gonna hit select no errors occurred in
04:21 - the loading of this extension so it
04:23 - should be fine now I can go to any page
04:25 - I just
04:26 - happen to be going to my coding train I
04:29 - mean my chrome extension tutorial page
04:31 - I'll go there now look I should be able
04:34 - to see this button right here this is my
04:35 - button the reason why it has that image
04:37 - is because I included the default icon
04:39 - to be this PNG file and if I click there
04:42 - look at that there's my pop-up it can't
04:51 - have a giant to chew right there and not
04:53 - use the train whistle all right so we
04:56 - see that the pop-ups work now let's try
04:58 - to do something a little bit more
04:59 - interesting with the pop-up let me see
05:01 - if I can put an animation there
05:03 - something let's see if I can put a whole
05:04 - p5 sketch there so let's try that so
05:08 - what I want to do I mean I'll just work
05:09 - with the file system for a second like
05:12 - let me see if I can do I'm gonna make a
05:13 - folder called sketch and then what I'm
05:16 - gonna do is I'm going to I'm gonna
05:18 - actually delete pop-up dot HTML we saw
05:22 - that that worked I'm going to pause for
05:25 - a second and come back in a second and
05:27 - I'm back now
05:29 - what I have done in that very long
05:31 - amount of time wait longer than should
05:33 - taken me is I have grabbed one of my
05:35 - previous examples from a coding
05:37 - challenge that generates a maze and I've
05:39 - put all of the code for that coding
05:41 - challenge in a folder called sketch so
05:43 - now what I want is for the pop-up to
05:47 - display that example let's just look at
05:50 - that example what that example does I've
05:51 - got that example also just running here
05:53 - in the browser let me just quickly go to
05:57 - that so this is the example it it
06:00 - generates a maze using a particular
06:02 - algorithm that I used a long time to go
06:04 - into challenge so what I want is when I
06:06 - click this the files not there anymore I
06:09 - want to see that means ok here we go
06:11 - we're gonna make this happen
06:12 - so what do I do what I have to do is
06:15 - this file doesn't exist anymore I
06:17 - deleted it what I need to do is here the
06:21 - default pop-up should be sketch slash
06:27 - index at HTML so the question is is that
06:30 - enough if I just point to that page
06:34 - that's in the sketch folder will it work
06:38 - or
06:39 - do I need to do something more to
06:41 - reference the different JavaScript files
06:43 - and libraries and things that I'm using
06:45 - let's find out and then I'm going to
06:49 - change oh let me just show you that here
06:51 - we should see we should say generate a
06:54 - maze that's going to be the message the
06:59 - little tooltip message when you hover
07:00 - over the button so I need to go and
07:02 - reload the Chrome extension and it
07:05 - doesn't actually really matter what page
07:06 - I'm on but I'm a stick on this page if I
07:09 - hover over here you should see right I'm
07:12 - getting that generate amazed message and
07:15 - then I worked so that was actually quite
07:19 - easy so you can see here I have the mais
07:24 - generating in the pop-up and
07:26 - interestingly enough let me press that
07:28 - but goes away
07:29 - is it gonna pause and continue from
07:32 - where it was before
07:33 - is it gonna start over had it already
07:36 - been running for a while when I first
07:37 - clicked it I'd even notice let's look
07:39 - again let's see this is interesting it
07:41 - started over so notice this is very
07:44 - important this is a page that's being
07:47 - loaded fresh each time every time you
07:50 - click it's not a page that's running and
07:52 - being hidden and then revealed it's
07:54 - actually a new page that's being loaded
07:56 - which brings up another question how do
07:59 - I debug something that's happening on
08:01 - the pop-up is there something here nope
08:07 - whoops so let's add a console dot log
08:10 - into the pop-up this is actually all of
08:14 - that code and I'm just going to say
08:17 - console dot log frame count so this is
08:22 - what I would log typically in a p5
08:24 - sketch if I wanted to just see that it
08:26 - was running it should say 0 1 2 3 4 5
08:28 - Counting every single frame so now I'm
08:32 - gonna reload the extension I'm going to
08:34 - refresh over here and I'm going to click
08:38 - the button so where is it logging that
08:40 - well let's look in the JavaScript
08:41 - console let's try clicking the button
08:44 - again it's
08:47 - / my console let me try again no so
08:50 - notice how this is not where the only
08:55 - the content script is playing a role in
08:58 - the actual content page this pop-up is
09:01 - just information so this video is about
09:03 - the end because I'm kind of at the end
09:05 - of it but I need to do something what I
09:07 - want to show is how you can have the
09:09 - content script send a message I'm sorry
09:11 - the pop-up send a message because
09:13 - ultimately maybe I want to build an
09:14 - interface there where I you know I made
09:16 - a Chrome extension where I do it along
09:18 - the page so maybe I can like pick a
09:20 - color or change the line thickness that
09:22 - type of thing so I'm gonna get to that
09:23 - in the next video but I at least want to
09:25 - figure out where I can debug this stuff
09:26 - if I look here this is where I would
09:29 - have a console log for a background
09:31 - script but I don't have a background
09:32 - script this is a pop-up I don't see it
09:34 - there where is it so actually thank you
09:36 - to the chat who clued me in on this I'm
09:39 - going to press this button here and I'm
09:41 - going to right click and if I right
09:43 - click I now see I have this option
09:45 - called inspect and I can select that and
09:48 - it's going to bring up another window I
09:50 - can go over to console so this is the
09:52 - JavaScript console for the pop-up
09:55 - there's a JavaScript console for the
09:57 - page content page there's a JavaScript
09:59 - console for the background script and
10:01 - now there's a JavaScript console for
10:03 - this particular pop-up okay so I've
10:06 - shown you how to add a pop-up you can do
10:08 - this
10:08 - anything that you can put on a web page
10:10 - can be in a pop-up you could start
10:13 - querying api's and drawing maps and
10:15 - doing anything in that pop-up so what I
10:17 - want to do in the next video is show you
10:19 - how to send a message from the pop-up to
10:23 - the content script and change something
10:26 - in the interface by what you're doing in
10:28 - the pop-up and I kind of have I have an
10:30 - idea for that
