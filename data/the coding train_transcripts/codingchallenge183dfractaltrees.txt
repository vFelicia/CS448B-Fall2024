00:01 - hello this video is a followup on my
00:04 - previous space colonization video now I
00:07 - wish I was talking about outer space
00:08 - colonization I am not I'm talking about
00:10 - an algorithm called space colonization
00:12 - which is outlined in this uh PDF paper
00:15 - here that you can find a link to in this
00:17 - video's description and it is possible
00:19 - with this algorithm to generate trees
00:21 - like this so last week time doesn't
00:25 - matter here but in my previous video I
00:28 - made a version of this algorithm
00:30 - I actually did it in JavaScript um using
00:33 - a JavaScript library called p5js but I
00:36 - have this same uh code running now in
00:39 - processing and I switched over to
00:40 - processing because the point of this
00:42 - video is to extend this algorithm into
00:44 - 3D so I want to take and let me run it
00:46 - here for you I want to take this idea
00:48 - which is using this branching algorithm
00:50 - come on and run please code using this
00:53 - branching algorithm uh to take this from
00:56 - a 2d world to 3D so let's let's talk
00:59 - about how this has to happen so first
01:02 - what's the what's the basic idea for
01:05 - this um what's the basic idea behind
01:08 - this algorithm so the idea of this
01:09 - algorithm is that you have a canvas and
01:12 - you fill this canvas with points and
01:15 - these points are known as
01:18 - leaves so maybe you fill this canvas
01:20 - with a bunch of points and then maybe
01:22 - you start at the bottom and you create a
01:24 - branch segment and you keep growing
01:26 - Branch segments all the way up until you
01:29 - get close enough to a particular to some
01:31 - of these leaves then what the algorithm
01:34 - does is it says okay any Leaf that's
01:37 - close to this particular Branch segment
01:40 - pull a force have it become an
01:43 - attraction Force so maybe this one and
01:45 - this one are close so a new segment is
01:47 - made and then this one and this one and
01:49 - this one are close to this one so a new
01:51 - segment is made here but this one is
01:52 - also close to this one um so another new
01:55 - segment is made so all of these Leaf
01:57 - points become these points of attraction
01:59 - that start just pulling out these
02:01 - branches and you can see that happen I'm
02:03 - going to come back to the code and I'm G
02:06 - to show I'm gonna I'm going to change
02:08 - here I'm gon to I'm going to in setup
02:09 - I'm going to say frame rate uh I'm going
02:12 - to just say five so frame five frames
02:14 - per second and we can watch this happen
02:16 - a bit more
02:19 - closely so you can see here these
02:21 - branches are getting pulled and pulled
02:24 - towards all of these points and as they
02:26 - get pulled towards these points those
02:28 - leaves disappear now now there's a
02:30 - couple things I want to mention about
02:32 - this I'm kind of recapping my previous
02:33 - video but I think it's worth it before
02:35 - we move to 3D to make sure we understand
02:37 - all the pieces here so number one I just
02:39 - want to kind of recap this particular
02:42 - program uh has a set of objects it has a
02:46 - leaf object that are these seed points
02:49 - here it has a branch
02:51 - object uh the branch object being these
02:55 - particular segments all of these
02:57 - segments and then it also has a tree
03:00 - object and the tree object keeps track
03:03 - of an array of Branch objects and an
03:06 - array of leaf objects so the algorithm
03:09 - goes something like for every leaf see
03:13 - what branches are within a minimum and
03:15 - maximum distance and add a force to
03:18 - those branches and then all and then
03:19 - have all those branches grow a new
03:21 - Branch off of them with a direction of
03:24 - that Force so the tree itself is
03:26 - iterating through all the leaves then uh
03:29 - applying forces to all the branches than
03:30 - making new Branch segments and as leaves
03:33 - are close enough to a given Branch they
03:35 - get deleted so this leads me to a to an
03:38 - issue though that I feel like is worth
03:39 - resolving in this example before we move
03:41 - on look at this there are some leaves
03:45 - that just won't go away they're there
03:48 - they're stuck there I can find another
03:49 - one uh over here is another one the
03:52 - reason why it's stuck there is that
03:54 - they're magically somehow exactly
03:57 - equidistant from a particular Branch set
04:00 - so the force can never go towards one to
04:03 - get a little bit closer um and then be
04:05 - removed from the system so I don't know
04:08 - I'm looking at you internet watching
04:09 - this video to come up with a a a
04:12 - solutions for this problem I had a
04:14 - wonderful solution uh suggested by
04:16 - Oliver in the chat recently um which is
04:19 - just to give each branch a little bit of
04:21 - extra random Force to it so that every
04:24 - once in a while as it's going there
04:25 - it'll randomly turn and in that case uh
04:28 - it'll eventually find these branches
04:30 - these leaves and get removed so let's
04:31 - add that
04:33 - here and I'm going to go uh to the part
04:36 - of the
04:38 - algorithm uh
04:40 - where uh we add those particular
04:45 - forces and
04:48 - actually what I want to do I want to do
04:51 - that I'm GNA do that in a different
04:52 - place than I did it before I was
04:53 - practicing this so this is where those
04:56 - new branches get added and this is where
04:59 - the Branch's Direction gets averaged
05:02 - based on how many forces were applied to
05:04 - it so what I want to do right here I'm
05:06 - just going to try making
05:09 - another
05:12 - random
05:14 - vector and I'm going to say I'm going to
05:17 - add that so right before the vector is
05:21 - about to be um right before the new
05:23 - branch is about to be born I'm just
05:25 - going to give it a little bit of random
05:27 - motion to it to see if it can like if it
05:30 - when it's getting stuck if it can skew
05:31 - towards one of those leaves so let's run
05:32 - this
05:36 - again oh and I have the frame rate at
05:38 - five so let me cancel that
05:42 - out let's run this again come on I don't
05:44 - know why my command R isn't work oh I'm
05:46 - in debug mode no wonder a so oh that's
05:49 - way too much look at that that kind of
05:50 - ruined
05:52 - it it did something but it's kind of
05:54 - like a crazy now so I probably shouldn't
05:56 - have added it
05:58 - here um okay okay so let me uh let me go
06:02 - back here let's so let's try to make
06:04 - that not so
06:06 - strong let's make it really really weak
06:09 - so I'm going to set its magnitude to uh
06:12 - something much much
06:13 - weaker and you can see maybe that wasn't
06:16 - strong enough so it's still like I've
06:18 - got these equidistance spots there so
06:20 - let's make it
06:22 - 0.1 that seem to do the trick ah there's
06:25 - a couple spots that are still stuck
06:27 - there let's try 0 five
06:31 - it's a little less kind of like curvy
06:33 - and fractally but it did work so I'm
06:35 - going to just like try
06:37 - three that looks pretty good so I think
06:40 - I settled on three as kind of my number
06:42 - that I want to do so you can see I at
06:44 - least have now resolved that problem the
06:46 - reason why I wanted to resolve that
06:47 - problem is I'm going to add something I
06:50 - don't want to be adding branches
06:52 - infinitely um and the other thing I want
06:54 - to do quickly to this before I move into
06:55 - 3D is uh is show you let's do something
06:58 - let's change the thickness of these
06:59 - branches so every Branch right now has a
07:02 - stroke weight of one but what if
07:03 - branches that are made earlier at the
07:05 - center are thicker than ones that are at
07:08 - the edge so a way that I can do that is
07:10 - right here this is where I'm actually
07:12 - drawing a line for every single Branch
07:15 - so every single Branch here is just a
07:17 - line between the um the Branch's
07:21 - position and its parents position
07:23 - connecting the one that's connected to
07:24 - it to itself so one thing I'm going to
07:26 - do here is just change this Loop to a
07:29 - regular
07:30 - Loop using index I uh to
07:35 - branches.
07:37 - size the reason what I the reason why I
07:40 - want to do that
07:43 - is what I want to do now is I want to
07:46 - say each branch is going to have a
07:48 - stroke weight so for example if I say
07:50 - stroke weight
07:51 - 10 you can see all the branches are
07:54 - really thick they have a thickness now
07:56 - of 10 pixels but what if I were to
07:58 - create a variable
08:00 - and map its index so the the the older
08:04 - branches are added at the beginning of
08:06 - the array so its index goes between zero
08:08 - and branches.
08:11 - size and have that go so the earlier
08:14 - ones have a thickness of 10 and the
08:16 - later ones at the end have a thickness
08:18 - of one and what if that is its Branch
08:20 - thickness you can now see we've got
08:22 - something here where the earlier they
08:25 - are at the beginning the thicker they
08:26 - are the more at the outside the less
08:28 - thick they are and I could like mess
08:29 - around with this mapping um I could you
08:32 - know just start with five or six I could
08:34 - actually go down to zero to get them
08:36 - like much skinnier even at the end which
08:37 - is kind of nice so I think this looks
08:39 - kind of nice and you can imagine what
08:41 - how this might have what kind of effect
08:44 - this might have depending on how you're
08:46 - seeding the points and where you're
08:47 - starting the root of the tree okay so I
08:52 - somehow said I this was a video All
08:54 - About 3D and I probably spent 10 minutes
08:57 - here just getting ready for that but
08:59 - we've recapped the algorithm and we've
09:01 - also made it a little bit better by
09:03 - adding thickness here and solved a
09:06 - particular problem and now we can
09:07 - actually do something that I believe
09:09 - will be quite simple uh in turning this
09:12 - into 3D so let's think about this so
09:15 - this is what's happening in a
09:16 - two-dimensional plane I created in the
09:21 - canvas I just created random Leaf points
09:24 - anywhere so what I want to do instead in
09:28 - 3D is I I want to think of the canvas
09:31 - not as um not as a flat plane but as a
09:36 - sphere so I'm going to create random
09:38 - points all inside a sphere and then I'm
09:41 - going to have my first Branch the root
09:43 - of the tree in the center of the sphere
09:45 - again if you really want to create a
09:47 - tree what you might do is create some
09:49 - kind of like ellipsoid in 3D seed all
09:52 - the points start the root at the bottom
09:54 - but I'm just going to do something
09:55 - simple just to get this algorithm
09:56 - working and then that's up to you to be
09:58 - creative to try to create a different
09:59 - set of seed points with a different
10:01 - starting Branch okay so let's come back
10:03 - over here and see if we can do this okay
10:05 - so the first thing I need to do if I'm
10:06 - going to move into
10:08 - 3D is just add p3d oh I'm not here is
10:12 - just add ins size p3d so what did I just
10:15 - do I just added p3d so I want to so now
10:18 - it's rendering in 3D I can actually just
10:20 - run this and see like hey same thing but
10:23 - it's actually in 3D now just so we can
10:26 - like get a sense of the camera a little
10:28 - bit better I'm going to add a library
10:30 - called peyam so I've already installed
10:33 - this Library um if you haven't installed
10:35 - this Library go to add Library under
10:38 - sketch import library but I've already
10:40 - installed pyam so I'm just going to
10:42 - click
10:43 - import and uh all I need is this import
10:46 - statement at the top then I need to
10:48 - create
10:49 - a
10:51 - peyam object I'm going to say cam equals
10:54 - new peyam and I have to say this so
10:57 - peyam is this Library just automatically
11:00 - like makes this mouse interactive camera
11:02 - so you can spin around and zoom in and
11:04 - out of your scene um in a very default
11:06 - way and what I need to do it I so I need
11:08 - to say this referring to this sketch is
11:10 - where I want this camera to take over
11:12 - and then I also need to give it a um a z
11:16 - value like how far away do I want to be
11:18 - looking at it so I'm just going to say
11:19 - 100 for right now um and then I'm going
11:22 - to run this and sort of see what happens
11:25 - so I can't seem to find like oh there it
11:27 - is so I'm off one of things that pey cam
11:30 - does for you is it makes z00 the center
11:33 - of the window as opposed to the top left
11:35 - so here in my tree where I'm creating
11:37 - the
11:39 - leaves um I actually want to create them
11:42 - I want to create well first of all I
11:44 - want to create the
11:45 - root at 0
11:47 - 0 and then uh where I'm creating the
11:50 - leaves uh sorry I want to
11:54 - make the leaves not offset by the center
11:57 - of the window anymore so let me just do
11:59 - that and we should see now there we go
12:02 - now one thing is I'm kind of zoomed in
12:04 - so I can zoom out and I can spin you can
12:06 - see now this is totally flat this is
12:08 - kind of a nice effect just in of itself
12:10 - so I still have my two-dimensional space
12:12 - colonizer but it's in 3D and I want to
12:15 - look at it from further away so let's
12:17 - make that
12:19 - 500 so you can see here so this looks
12:21 - exactly like what we had before but
12:23 - secretly it's in 3D now so this is
12:27 - actually I believe going to be in
12:29 - incredibly simple all I need to do is
12:32 - instead of making a two-dimensional
12:34 - plane of leaf points right I'm not
12:36 - actually let's not call
12:40 - grow so what do I have here this system
12:43 - is just a whole lot of a whole lot of
12:46 - points in a two-dimensional plane why
12:48 - are they that because all I did was make
12:51 - random 2D vectors so watch how simple
12:53 - this is going to be Random 3D I want to
12:56 - make I'm sorry Random 3D vectors and I'm
12:58 - going to run
12:59 - it and now you can see whoa okay so
13:02 - what's going on I made 3D vectors but I
13:06 - only see two dimensional points well
13:08 - there's a bit of a problem here which is
13:10 - that my points are ellipses so what I
13:13 - want to draw I need to draw those at
13:15 - their three-dimensional location so I'm
13:17 - going to change this to translate pause.
13:19 - x pause. y pause.
13:23 - z and now the ellipse can be at 0 0 and
13:28 - I'm going to say put push
13:30 - Matrix pop Matrix to make each ellipse
13:34 - its own thing so I'm going to run this
13:36 - now whoops let me Zoom back out and you
13:39 - can see now I have this let me Zoom back
13:43 - in I have this 3D sphere of points now
13:46 - they're ellipses so as I turn to the
13:48 - side they're not long they're no longer
13:50 - facing forward and I can make them
13:51 - spheres you know there's any number of
13:53 - things I could do let's just make them
13:54 - spheres for a second just for
13:56 - fun what's more fun than making them
13:59 - spheres I'm just curious to see how slow
14:00 - this runs now notice look how slow this
14:02 - runs so I don't want to make them
14:04 - spheres because I don't even need to see
14:06 - them for this algorithm to happen but
14:09 - spheres require a ton of rendering
14:11 - because each sphere has like a zillion
14:12 - polygons and I could reduce the detail
14:14 - in the Spheres and there's all sorts of
14:15 - things I could do but I'm just going to
14:17 - leave them as ellipses so I'm going to
14:18 - run this again and you can see here now
14:21 - I have this so now all I should be able
14:24 - I I should just be able to grow the tree
14:26 - I mean all the math is going to be the
14:27 - same whether it's 3D vectors or 2D
14:29 - vectors so let's grow the tree again I'm
14:32 - going to turn grow
14:34 - on and we're going to run it let's see
14:36 - what happens it's something is working I
14:39 - can see all those branches happening and
14:42 - something didn't but look it's still
14:45 - flat it's so sad it's still flat so why
14:48 - is it flat well am I drawing the
14:51 - branches in 3D I probably have a line
14:53 - function that's just doing 2D so let me
14:55 - go back to the tree all the way at the
14:57 - bottom this is where I'm drawing each
14:59 - branch as a line between the Branch's
15:01 - position and its parents position so I
15:04 - just need to add the z-coordinate for
15:07 - these this
15:09 - line and I got to go all scroll all the
15:12 - way to the right here to get also b.
15:14 - parent. doz so now I should have a
15:17 - three-dimensional
15:20 - line and let's see what happens it's
15:22 - growing it's growing it seems to be
15:25 - getting everywhere and now look at this
15:27 - there we go look at this crazy
15:29 - three-dimensional wacky strange shape
15:31 - that I have and I can zoom on into it
15:33 - and look inside and scroll around and we
15:35 - can see there's different thicknesses
15:37 - it's thinner on the outside now some
15:39 - branches just didn't some leaves just
15:41 - didn't get reached and it's hard for me
15:44 - to uh I'm gonna I I can't tell if I have
15:47 - this equidistant problem anymore I don't
15:50 - think so I think some branches are just
15:51 - some leaves are just kind of too far
15:53 - away so uh you know there's some ways
15:55 - around that I could F fuss with the um
15:59 - uh this this sort of minimum and maximum
16:01 - distance like let me make the maximum
16:03 - distance 200 and I think that's going to
16:05 - help things so that uh I think that's
16:08 - probably going to yeah you can see now I
16:09 - got to everything um so that just by
16:12 - increasing that maximum distance leaves
16:14 - that are kind of too far away will get
16:16 - found now here's the thing there's a
16:18 - bunch of things that I've done here yeah
16:20 - it doesn't look someone in the chat
16:21 - writes it doesn't look like a tree it
16:23 - doesn't look at all like a tree so maybe
16:25 - before I go I'll make this look a little
16:27 - bit more like a tree but here's really
16:29 - your job so your job is to be a
16:33 - designer come over here please um so
16:37 - what have I
16:38 - done all that I have done is create sort
16:42 - of a default view of the algorithm
16:45 - working so and think about it in two
16:47 - Dimensions I made a sphere I filled the
16:50 - sphere with points and I started with in
16:53 - the middle and stuff is growing out so
16:55 - really I almost made this like veiny
16:56 - blood vessely like system um so if you
17:01 - want to make a tree you've got to be
17:02 - more thoughtful so on the one hand I I
17:05 - made a suggestion of what if you kind of
17:08 - create uh and actually something like
17:09 - this might work well what if you this is
17:11 - all your seed points look like this and
17:14 - then you actually start the root from
17:15 - the bottom so you need to come up what's
17:17 - your Vol and if you read the space
17:19 - colonization paper it will give you
17:20 - suggestions what's the volume where you
17:23 - create all of your seed points and then
17:25 - where do you start the rout so that's on
17:28 - the one hand going to make make it look
17:29 - more like a tree the other thing you
17:31 - need to think about is just you know I
17:33 - just use three-dimensional lines which
17:35 - aren't really there's not a lot to them
17:38 - so you might think about well actually
17:40 - what you want to put are cylinders for
17:42 - each branch segment and maybe you want
17:44 - to texture those cylinders with some
17:45 - kind of like wood looking texture and
17:47 - then you want to add some lighting to
17:48 - the scene and then maybe you actually
17:50 - want to put at the points that are at
17:52 - the end you want to actually put actual
17:54 - leaves on like various parts of the
17:56 - brain so I think there's a lot of kind
17:57 - of visual dressing that you can add so
18:00 - there is two there's your seed points
18:03 - how those seed points are organized
18:04 - there's where you start the root those
18:07 - things will um get you sort of closer to
18:09 - the tree as well as your sort of visual
18:11 - dressing what's your lighting what's
18:13 - your texturing how are you drawing the
18:14 - branches are you adding like leaves
18:16 - attached to the branches that sort of
18:17 - thing so I would like all of you to
18:19 - explore those types of things
18:23 - um okay yeah the other people are saying
18:25 - it looks like Connections in a brain or
18:27 - a plasma ball thingy those are all
18:28 - excellent points so let me at least get
18:31 - you started to show you where you can
18:33 - make these kinds of changes so I'm going
18:35 - to uh save this as space colonizer 3D
18:38 - all the code will be uploaded on GitHub
18:40 - with a link and I also uh um and I'm
18:44 - let's just add a few more things to this
18:45 - before we go so what I'm going to do is
18:48 - say
18:49 - um uh let me
18:52 - make the scene that we're looking at a
18:56 - bit taller so I'm going to make it 900
18:58 - by 600
18:59 - we can see um uh sorry I want to make it
19:03 - uh 600 by 900 so I want to make it kind
19:07 - of oops oh my goodness I I hit something
19:11 - by accident here um I want to so you can
19:13 - see I just want to have my window be a
19:14 - little bit taller and then what I want
19:16 - to do is have the leaves start uh I want
19:20 - the leaves to just go out by
19:23 - like uh um still be a sphere but I want
19:27 - to offset that
19:29 - um so I want to say Yus equal like
19:32 - height / 2 so that should offset
19:35 - everything up yeah there we go so um so
19:39 - this is what I wanted to do but then I
19:40 - also want so that's way too much and
19:42 - then I also want the tree's root so in
19:46 - the tree object the root gets a point I
19:49 - want it to actually start at the bottom
19:51 - of the window which is 0 comma height
19:53 - divided two so I want to start the root
19:56 - at the bottom so this is bit more tree
19:59 - like so uh you know how successful this
20:03 - is I'll let you be the judge of that but
20:05 - you can see just by having kind of a
20:06 - tree at the starting just by having like
20:09 - a sphere of points up top and the root
20:12 - of the and starting the root at the
20:13 - bottom you get this kind of stock root
20:16 - like thing and then it starts to Branch
20:17 - out at the top but again maybe the
20:20 - there's a uniform distribution of random
20:22 - points now all in that sphere maybe
20:24 - there should be even more along the top
20:26 - and less on the bottom or some type of
20:27 - like cone shape I encourage you to
20:29 - experiment with it but this I think will
20:31 - get you a little bit further into seeing
20:33 - it's kind of treel likee and I'm just
20:35 - sorry I'm addicted to spinning around
20:37 - this um okay so I think this
20:40 - concludes um uh this video I'm just GNA
20:44 - some people in the chat are asking like
20:46 - what did I do to change so let me just
20:48 - mention again since I did that kind of
20:49 - quickly in the leaf object the leaf
20:53 - object this beginning function right
20:55 - here this is where the initial Leaf
20:58 - position positions are set every
21:00 - position is a random 3D Vector scaled
21:03 - according to the width of the window
21:05 - which is about 300 pixels and then I'm
21:07 - offsetting it by height divided by four
21:09 - so moving all the Y positions up that's
21:12 - where all the leaves are set now where
21:14 - does the tree begin growing the tree
21:16 - begins growing in the tree object and
21:19 - the variable is this root Branch so the
21:22 - root Branch incidentally has two
21:25 - arguments the root Branch gets where
21:27 - it's positioned so zero height divided
21:30 - by two so down at the bottom and also
21:32 - that Vector is the direction where it
21:34 - starts growing so incidentally if I were
21:36 - to change this to
21:38 - this we'd have a problem
21:41 - because nothing would happen the
21:43 - branches grow the tree is growing off to
21:45 - the right to Infinity so it needs to
21:48 - grow up so to speak there we go okay so
21:52 - I The PRP at growing is really quite
21:55 - lovely and nice and i''d also be
21:56 - interesting like you know all those
21:58 - branches objects what if you start
21:59 - moving the points after the fact add
22:01 - some Physics to it have it Blow In The
22:02 - Wind so many possibilities okay so um
22:06 - this was much longer than I had intended
22:09 - but this is hopefully a nice followup to
22:11 - the previous space colonization in 2D
22:14 - video and what I did here was fix a few
22:16 - things about it add thickness move it
22:18 - into 3D I hope that you make something
22:20 - with this and that you share it with me
22:22 - in particular add your own kind of
22:23 - visual design spin to it um and I look
22:26 - forward to seeing what you make thanks
22:27 - for watching
