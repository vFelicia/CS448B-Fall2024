00:00 - okay I'm back by the way in between the
00:02 - last video in this one suggestion came
00:05 - in in the chat to say like oh you know
00:07 - be easier if you just had a bunch of
00:08 - buttons so like I could just click
00:09 - whichever button yeah I think the color
00:12 - is so if this is like ah its greenish to
00:14 - me I'm gonna refresh oh that's also
00:17 - greenish that's purplish that's blueish
00:21 - right so I just click the button and it
00:23 - submits and actually probably when I hit
00:25 - but I do that I can have it then pick a
00:27 - new color so what I need to do is now is
00:29 - send the send the color to firebase
00:34 - alright so I'm now logged in to some
00:36 - arbitrary Google accounts called coding
00:38 - rainbow live and I'm going to add a
00:40 - project and I'm going to call this color
00:42 - classification and I'm gonna accept all
00:47 - sorts of and agree to all sorts of
00:48 - things I'm gonna hit create project I'm
00:52 - gonna wait for it to do its thing okay
01:09 - continue a new Frederick's is ready
01:12 - alright really get started ah yes add
01:17 - firebase to your web app perfect okay so
01:19 - what I need is this stuff so let me grab
01:23 - this and go to index of HTML and and by
01:26 - the way there are so many things that
01:29 - could be done to improve the interface
01:30 - here and I should probably work on an
01:32 - HTML and add CSS and all that stuff
01:33 - that's not the focus of this video so I
01:37 - don't at me is what I'm supposed to say
01:39 - but you should at me though I'm okay
01:42 - with being acted at at act act at will
01:45 - just be nice be nice alright so I'm
01:49 - gonna add this stuff so I'm gonna add
01:53 - this script tag for firebase and I'm
01:56 - actually just going to take this and I'm
01:58 - gonna put this in in my peace with my p5
02:03 - code I'm just gonna actually just do
02:05 - this at the beginning of setup okay so
02:10 - now I'm connected to firebase I don't
02:12 - know
02:13 - let's let's see what happens hit refresh
02:15 - yeah it's not telling me anything but
02:23 - should be good yeah it's something's
02:25 - happening here okay great now I need to
02:28 - by the way I need this send data to go
02:30 - with all these buttons so I should be
02:32 - able to say buttons dot length and I
02:40 - should just be able to say buttons dot
02:42 - mouse press a buttons index i dot mouse
02:45 - pressed send data so this is the
02:48 - assigning this send data event to every
02:51 - single one of those buttons and guess
02:53 - what right here I'm gonna just say
02:55 - console.log this dot HTML so by the way
03:01 - so when you use the p5 mousepressed
03:03 - function and give it an event that event
03:06 - is bound to the Dom element upon which
03:09 - it was called and referenced in the
03:11 - keyword this so and then HTML is the
03:14 - text of the button so this should if I
03:16 - do this we can see whatever button I
03:19 - click I get the label in the console
03:24 - that's good so now I need to send the
03:27 - data to firebase so gonna tell me how to
03:29 - do that here okay so I could start to
03:32 - look at the firebase documentation but
03:34 - I'm gonna and you know I could go back
03:36 - and watch my firebase tutorials because
03:38 - I completely forgotten how to use it but
03:39 - I do have one of my examples and this
03:42 - example here has some code in it which
03:45 - send to firebase so and it's actually
03:48 - quite easy for me to do this I just want
03:51 - to need to create a reference database
03:54 - I'm gonna call it like colors or
03:56 - something I need to put some data in it
03:58 - so let me grab all this code here and
04:02 - I'm gonna grab this code and I'm going
04:05 - to put it I'll link to that particular
04:07 - example as well I'm gonna just put it in
04:10 - here I'm gonna use let and I'm not my
04:13 - example that I made before the firebase
04:15 - tutorial is about fruits but I'm gonna
04:18 - do a color I'm gonna say color label of
04:23 - the databases color database and I'm
04:26 - going to call it
04:27 - colors the data that I want to send is
04:30 - has an R and that is and I need these
04:35 - then to be global variables if I want to
04:38 - be able to access them so so I'm gonna
04:41 - make these global variables and give
04:45 - them an initial value I'm actually going
04:48 - to put this though in a function called
04:51 - pick color
04:52 - I think that'll make everything nicer
04:54 - I'm gonna say function a pick color and
05:00 - then I'm going to create an object with
05:04 - oh I could use that what's that thing
05:07 - called and es6 now where I could just
05:09 - make the object if I want the R value to
05:11 - be are the G value to be G there's a way
05:14 - to do that the B value to be B and then
05:16 - I want the label to be this dot html' so
05:22 - this is the object this is what I want
05:23 - to send to firebase the red green and
05:25 - blue value and the label so then I'm
05:28 - just going to say let the particular
05:33 - color be the color database
05:36 - push push that data and when it's
05:43 - finished oh it's going to give me this
05:44 - like key which is interesting to see
05:46 - because everything has this unique every
05:48 - record in a database has a unique ID so
05:50 - I could look at that just to see if it's
05:52 - right and I can have this callback
05:53 - finished something went wrong I could
05:57 - you use console dot error or data save
06:00 - successfully and let's see so let's
06:04 - let's do console dot log saving saving
06:13 - data and then also log the data and
06:17 - let's see what happens okay so now I'm
06:21 - going to go back to here and that that
06:24 - to me is pinkish and oppressed pinkish
06:27 - database is not defined oh yeah line 49
06:31 - Oh
06:34 - firebase initialized so what did I not
06:37 - do that I did in this particular example
06:41 - when I initialized it oh did I create I
06:44 - have to create a database object so I
06:46 - have to create a database object from
06:49 - after I initialize firebase so let's go
06:52 - and do that that's a step that I missed
06:54 - and I mean that's going to be a global
06:56 - variable called database now I'm gonna
07:01 - run this again
07:02 - that looks very greenish to me and
07:05 - saving this data 5220 665 with this
07:09 - label it generated a key but permission
07:11 - denied so now what I need to do is do
07:14 - something to allow myself to write to
07:17 - the database I'm gonna do something not
07:19 - so great but I'm gonna do it anyway so I
07:23 - need to change the permissions that are
07:25 - in my firebase project so how come I've
07:29 - lost where that is probably understeer
07:31 - project settings color classification
07:37 - where is it users and permissions now I
07:41 - have to be thoughtful and think about
07:43 - like the privacy and security of the
07:45 - data which is a really important point
07:47 - but again in this sort of like thing
07:49 - that I'm just working on and try to just
07:51 - get to the finish line here and with a
07:53 - trivial data set I'm going to at least
07:55 - just sort of open up and make make the
07:56 - data base easily writable without a lot
07:58 - of security rules so let's see so I need
08:00 - to go to firebase and I need to go to
08:02 - your two database and actually I don't
08:05 - even have a real time database available
08:08 - yet so I need to do gets to heart hid
08:09 - and then look at this so make your
08:12 - database private by denying all reads
08:14 - and writes which is something that you
08:16 - really that that in many cases you're
08:17 - gonna want to do start in test mode
08:20 - anyone with your database reference will
08:22 - be able to read and write to your
08:23 - database I'm gonna hit an able I am
08:26 - gonna add one more thing to the I am
08:30 - gonna add one more thing to the rules so
08:33 - and thank you to me I am so me from the
08:35 - chat I can add in a rule for color data
08:43 - I'm gonna add another rule and let me
08:45 - zoom in here so you can see what I'm
08:47 - doing I what I want to do is I don't
08:48 - want to let somebody overwrite somebody
08:50 - else's entry that they already put in
08:52 - and so if I say
08:54 - dollar sign entry and then I set the
09:00 - write the dot write property to not data
09:06 - exists and again you can look through
09:09 - the documentation to see all the
09:11 - different things let's see does this is
09:14 - this right here I think I've got this
09:15 - right color data open bracket close
09:19 - bracket dollar sign entry open bracket
09:22 - close bracket dot write not data exists
09:26 - this should hopefully give me a little
09:28 - bit more protection I'm gonna hit
09:30 - publish and now click back to database
09:35 - Oh get started where is it well maybe I
09:39 - have a good I haven't written any data
09:40 - yet let's now run this again what is
09:44 - that that's kind of brownish I guess
09:46 - there we go looks like it's saved the
09:49 - data successfully and let's go now back
09:52 - to here and see what we got there we go
09:57 - colors and here it is there's my first
10:00 - data point I could go and add a bunch
10:02 - more reddish Oh what I wanted to do is
10:10 - then also have it pick a new color so as
10:13 - soon as it finishes data saved
10:15 - successfully let's say pick color and
10:18 - we'll get a new one right because it's
10:21 - going to pick color pick color should
10:24 - also draw the color so that's greenish
10:29 - greenish bluish bluish greenish purplish
10:36 - greenish oops oh I messed up but that's
10:39 - okay
10:40 - reddish greenish okay so I think we're
10:43 - done this is finished I'm going to put
10:45 - this somewhere on the internet maybe
10:47 - clean it up and add some interface stuff
10:49 - to it just here we can quickly see we
10:52 - can quickly see my data set these are
10:55 - all the things that are ventured so far
10:57 - with the RGB values and a label okay so
11:00 - now what I'm going to do between now and
11:02 - the next video is I'm gonna let this
11:04 - live for a bit try to
11:05 - collect the data I might have to clean
11:07 - the data a bit which I'll talk about put
11:09 - it into a spreadsheet figure out what I
11:10 - want to do with it but but and then I'll
11:14 - see you in the next video and I'll start
11:15 - to work on building the machine learning
11:16 - model to actually train the model based
11:19 - on this data okay thanks for watching
11:20 - and I'll see you soon
11:26 - [Music]
11:29 - you
