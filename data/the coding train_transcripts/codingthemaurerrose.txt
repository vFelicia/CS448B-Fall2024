00:00 - Hello and welcome to the
pilot episode of a new series
00:03 - on The Coding Train--
00:04 - Choo Choo, don't have
my train whistle,
00:05 - called Coding in the Cabana.
00:19 - Here I am, seated in the cabana.
00:21 - I've got a camera here.
00:22 - I've got a camera here.
00:23 - And what I'm going to attempt
to tackle for you today
00:25 - is something known
as the Maurrer Rose.
00:32 - I don't know if
that really worked.
00:34 - I've made a lot of
scratching sounds.
00:36 - All right, so I have,
before, on this channel
00:39 - made a coding challenge.
00:41 - In fact, I believe I
have it right over here.
00:43 - Coding challenge number 55--
00:45 - mathematical rose patterns.
00:47 - And this is something
I do quite often,
00:49 - I take this idea of
a Cartesian plane--
00:53 - let's try the pink
marker, why don't we?
00:56 - And if we have a point that's
at, like, an x location,
01:01 - and we have a point
that's at a y location,
01:04 - and I think of this
as x, y, I can also
01:08 - think of this
point as a distance
01:10 - from the center, or
radius, and an angle.
01:15 - That's known as a
polar coordinate.
01:17 - And of course, I have all these
videos about polar coordinates.
01:20 - I have a song about
polar coordinates.
01:22 - I didn't make it, but somebody
made it using my voice.
01:25 - And it is a huge topic,
many mathematical patterns
01:28 - and algorithmic art
emanates from thinking
01:31 - in terms of polar
coordinates rather than
01:32 - Cartesian coordinates.
01:34 - So what is a
[? burrough ?] rose?
01:36 - So this idea was
actually first suggested
01:39 - in July of 2016, which is over
three years ago, amazingly
01:44 - enough, by Ruby Childs, linking
to both star rose pattern
01:48 - and Maurrer Rose pattern.
01:50 - Oh, look at this.
01:51 - We're going to have to do this.
01:53 - I've been doing the
the Maurrer Rose,
01:55 - but look at this one, wow.
01:56 - We're going to have to
come back to the star rose.
01:58 - And look at these
Maurrer rose patterns.
01:59 - So here we are.
02:00 - This is the code from
coding challenge number 55,
02:03 - mathematical roses.
02:04 - And this is demonstrating
creating a rose pattern
02:07 - with two parameters--
two variables, really, D
02:09 - and N. These sliders are
tied to those variables.
02:13 - And as I change the values,
we see different polar roses.
02:17 - And here's a very,
very simple one.
02:18 - So this is an example of a
rose, or rhodonea curve--
02:24 - a sinusoid plotted
in polar coordinates.
02:27 - And we can see,
look at, these are
02:28 - a variety of different
patterns you can
02:30 - get with this very simple idea.
02:32 - The idea being that we want
to move an angle, right?
02:37 - Right here.
02:37 - An angle again along a
path, a circular path,
02:41 - all the way around.
02:42 - And as we're doing that, the
radius is going to change.
02:45 - So if the radius is
going in, you know,
02:47 - I can get sort of
patterns like that.
02:49 - That was the worst drawing ever.
02:51 - I'm so sorry.
02:51 - I'm not using this chalkboard--
not that I draw well anyway.
02:54 - A Maurrer rose does a bit more.
02:57 - It consists of 360 lines
successively connecting
03:02 - the above 360 points.
03:04 - So we've got a little
bit more going on.
03:06 - We've got this polar
coordinate, sin of n times k--
03:09 - it's kind of like
we had before--
03:11 - comma, k.
03:12 - So this being the radius,
this being the angle.
03:15 - And the angle is 0D, 2D, 3D, and
D is a variable in the system.
03:21 - So I think I kind
of understand it.
03:23 - So n, the two
values are N and D.
03:26 - And K is just indicating this
iteration that's happening.
03:29 - So let's see if I can recreate
this pattern right here.
03:33 - So I could start with this code.
03:35 - I'm going to kind
of start over, just
03:37 - to kind of do the whole thing
from a blank p 5 sketch.
03:41 - So let's just get that polar
circular path to start.
03:47 - So I'm going to say stroke 255.
03:49 - I'm going to translate
to the middle.
03:53 - I'm going to-- by the way,
I had some beautiful roses
03:56 - in the garden up there.
03:57 - I'll show you some footage
that I took a week ago.
03:59 - They're not there anymore,
but that's kind of
04:01 - inspired me to do this idea.
04:02 - Stroke 255, for let a equal 0.
04:11 - a is less than 2--
04:14 - whoops, am I using a 0?
04:16 - 2pi, a++.
04:19 - And then x equals r times
cosine of the angle.
04:22 - y equals r times
sine of the angle.
04:26 - If I have an r, let's just
say r is, for right now, 150.
04:32 - And let's use
angle mode degrees.
04:35 - Let's just be simple and set
the angle mode to degrees.
04:39 - Most computer graphics systems
treat angles, by default,
04:43 - in the measurement
of radians, the unit
04:45 - measurement of radians.
04:46 - And a lot of my videos do that.
04:47 - But P5 allows you
to say degrees.
04:49 - And since the Wikipedia
page has different patterns
04:51 - with the angle in degrees, this
might be more helpful to us.
04:55 - So now, if I say
beginShape, endShape,
05:03 - this allows me to
create a closed path.
05:05 - I could even put
close down here.
05:06 - I don't know if I need that.
05:08 - I want to say no--
05:10 - I don't want to
fill up the path.
05:12 - And then, what do I want to say?
05:14 - Oh, vertex.
05:15 - So this is the start.
05:17 - It was probably similar to
that previous coding challenge.
05:20 - And we run this.
05:21 - I don't see anything,
because [INAUDIBLE]
05:23 - to change the background.
05:24 - Let's put on auto
refresh right now.
05:30 - a++.
05:32 - Well, if I'm thinking in
terms of radians, right?
05:35 - Radians all the way around
the circle once is 2pi.
05:38 - But in degrees, it
should be 360 degrees.
05:44 - Now, there we go.
05:45 - There's our circle.
05:46 - So this is a good start.
05:48 - Now, I think, if I just go
back to the Wikipedia page
05:52 - and look at the
formula, I basically
05:53 - want to replace how
this loop is working,
05:56 - and how I'm calculating
the radius and the angle.
06:00 - So let's see if I
can understand this.
06:02 - So if I come back here, k--
06:04 - so it looks like I can
do k going from 0 to 360.
06:09 - And maybe technically, I
actually want to go to 361.
06:12 - So let's make this loop k.
06:16 - I think this is going to be--
06:17 - I think this is going
to work pretty quickly.
06:19 - So that's k.
06:21 - Then the angle is n times k.
06:24 - What's n?
06:25 - Oh n is-- and k is this.
06:28 - Oh, I need a d.
06:29 - Sorry.
06:30 - OK.
06:32 - I've got this.
06:33 - So this is not actually k.
06:34 - Let's just call this i.
06:38 - There is no indication-- i is
standing in for 0, 1, 2, 3.
06:43 - So I need a parameter n.
06:46 - Where-- what are the things?
06:48 - All right. n is 2, d is 29.
06:50 - All right.
06:51 - Let's go back to the code.
06:53 - Let's actually put
those on the top.
06:55 - Let n equal 2.
06:57 - Let d equal 29.
06:58 - There we go.
06:59 - This is going to make
my life a lot easier.
07:01 - And so now, what I
want to say is k.
07:03 - k equals i times d.
07:07 - k equals i times d.
07:09 - And then r, sorry, r
is sine of n times k.
07:20 - r is sine of n times k.
07:23 - OK.
07:24 - And then the angle,
the angle is just k.
07:29 - So I can just change this to k.
07:32 - And I believe, if I
zoom in right over here,
07:36 - there's the Maurrer
rose pattern.
07:37 - But it's so tiny.
07:38 - I need to expand it out.
07:40 - So one thing I'm just
sort of curious to do
07:41 - is I could try saying
something like scale.
07:46 - And we can start to see it's--
07:47 - I'm sort of like using
scale to grow it.
07:50 - But the line is so thick,
the line thickness.
07:53 - There you are.
07:54 - The line thickness grows
with the scale function.
07:57 - So more likely, I could think
about the stroke weight.
07:59 - But really, what
I want to do here
08:01 - I think is just expand out
[INAUDIBLE] by like 150.
08:05 - And there we go.
08:06 - This looks like exactly
like this more rows pattern.
08:09 - And in theory, if I were to
just say things like n equals 6,
08:13 - d equals 71.
08:17 - n equals 6, d equals 71.
08:21 - Boom.
08:21 - I've got this pattern,
which looks precisely
08:23 - like the pattern in
the Wikipedia page.
08:25 - Look we did the Maurrer rose.
08:26 - Ding, train whistle,
all that stuff.
08:30 - Let's add a few more
things to this sketch.
08:33 - One is I like the way
these visualizations
08:36 - show the plane
sinusoidal pattern--
08:38 - if I'm saying that correctly--
along with the Maurrer
08:42 - rose in different colors.
08:43 - So I think the way that I would
do that is by just saying,
08:48 - let me add a second pass.
08:51 - And I think the difference
here is, if k is just i.
08:56 - Well, I can't see because
I need a different color.
08:59 - Now let's make it blue.
09:03 - Yeah, and stroke weight 2.
09:07 - Get a little brighter
with some alpha, maybe.
09:12 - Make the stroke weight 4.
09:14 - And then this should just
have a stroke weight of 1.
09:18 - So now we're kind of seeing--
and I guess I don't, maybe
09:21 - I don't want the alpha there.
09:22 - We're sort of seeing--
09:23 - we can see the original, though.
09:24 - So this is the pattern
that I did, I believe,
09:26 - in the first
mathematical roses video.
09:30 - And it's just, the k is
just the actual angle.
09:35 - So I'm going around the polar
path one time, from i to 360.
09:39 - And I think I don't need this
closed here, because that's
09:41 - what I have, 361.
09:43 - But the difference
is the Maurrer
09:45 - rose has a multiplier for--
09:51 - for that angle itself, k.
09:53 - And so it kind of, there's this
extra, like, layering thing
09:56 - that's happening as
the lines connect
09:58 - across a further distance.
10:00 - I don't know if that
explanation made a lot of sense.
10:02 - But you know you
could imagine, right,
10:04 - if I were to make d, I
know how we could do it.
10:06 - Ah, I know how we could
demonstrate this really well.
10:09 - D slider-- not d Snyder--
10:14 - d slider equals a slider
that has a range between,
10:20 - let's say, like 1 and 180.
10:22 - I'm just sort of making that up.
10:23 - And let's start at 1.
10:26 - And then, actually, the value
of d should be d slider.value.
10:33 - So now, we don't see it.
10:35 - And if I start to
increase it, you
10:37 - can see the pattern
starting to emerge there.
10:43 - And based on-- if I get
all the way up to 100.
10:46 - So I guess there was sort of
a sweet spot in there, which
10:49 - was 71.
10:52 - All right, so that's
pretty interesting.
10:54 - And now you could imagine,
I could also add--
10:56 - make a slider for n.
10:58 - I kind of like doing things,
however, maybe a little
11:01 - bit more automatically.
11:03 - So I think you could
use [INAUDIBLE]
11:05 - to adjust n and d, open
simplex noise, you could use.
11:09 - You could try using
a sine wave itself
11:13 - to oscillate those values.
11:14 - I might try doing something
like just setting them at zero.
11:19 - And then what I would
do here, in draw,
11:23 - is do something like
n plus equals 0.01,
11:27 - and d plus equals 0.01.
11:28 - Let's just see
what happens there.
11:29 - Whoa.
11:31 - And we start to see
something happen there,
11:34 - which is pretty interesting.
11:37 - And maybe, what I
want to do is have
11:42 - d go up a little bit faster.
11:44 - I don't know why.
11:46 - I'm thinking that's meaningful.
11:47 - But you can imagine-- so I'm
not doing this with any thought.
11:50 - But this, you could
imagine creating
11:52 - some type of interactive
installation,
11:54 - creating patterns.
11:55 - I mean, the numbers are just
going to grow really high,
11:56 - and it's going to probably
go a little bit crazy.
11:58 - But this is fun,
and interesting,
12:00 - and I think, quite pretty.
12:01 - And we made something.
12:03 - We're sitting here in a cabana
with no electricity-- we.
12:05 - I am.
12:06 - I've got multiple cameras.
12:07 - I've got a chalkboard.
12:09 - There's a garden out there.
12:10 - It's really time for
me to water the plants.
12:12 - And that's what I'm
going to do next.
12:23 - All right thanks so
much for watching
12:25 - this new experiment of mine--
12:26 - Coding in the Cabana.
12:29 - I don't know how
this went and if this
12:32 - is going to be as useful,
more useful, better
12:34 - or worse than the standard
live streaming videos I do.
12:37 - But please, let me
know in the comments.
12:39 - Gardening tips are
welcome, very welcome.
12:41 - I don't know what to do
once it becomes winter.
12:43 - All right, goodbye, thank you.
12:45 - I don't have a saying.
12:46 - I need a sign off saying.
12:47 - Choo-choo, I suppose,
is my sign off saying.
12:50 - All right, I'll finish
watering these plants.
12:51 - Enjoy.
