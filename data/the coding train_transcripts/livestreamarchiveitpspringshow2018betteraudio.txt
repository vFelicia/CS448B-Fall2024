00:00 - oh okay hello I think we're live maybe
00:02 - if your watch seeing this type something
00:04 - into the chat so that it'll scroll by my
00:07 - name is Dan welcome to a special where's
00:10 - that sound coming from episode of the
00:14 - coding train at the ITP show woohoo this
00:16 - is something of a tradition now so it's
00:18 - it's right now it is about 2:50 p.m.
00:21 - Eastern Time
00:22 - the ITP show doesn't officially start
00:24 - until 4:00 which is an hour from now but
00:26 - we're gonna walk around and look at
00:28 - projects and guess what
00:29 - I'm not holding the camera all of you
00:33 - who have there you saw you got an image
00:34 - of dahveed there real quick who has
00:36 - graciously volunteered to hold the
00:38 - camera so that most of these live
00:40 - streams it's just been a total disaster
00:42 - of me like dropping the camera having it
00:45 - spin around so I bit the bullet I wanted
00:47 - to just do this all by myself and thank
00:49 - you - dahveed for volunteering to hold
00:51 - the camera I should also note that this
00:53 - microphone is nothing that you're
00:54 - recording secondary audio because later
00:58 - I will make an edited version of this
01:01 - with like a highlight reel of projects
01:04 - and also use this particular audio from
01:06 - this mic and zoom recorder so you don't
01:12 - hear anything Mike it's just quiet yeah
01:17 - so well I think it's gonna can you mi
01:22 - can you reasonably hear me somewhat they
01:25 - can hear but it's low there it's low I
01:27 - don't know if there's too much that can
01:29 - be done about that is there okay we're
01:35 - gonna so the audio might be problematic
01:36 - but it's just gonna be the best it is
01:39 - but I will oh so let me mention a couple
01:41 - other things one is if you happen to be
01:43 - watching this not live you can look in
01:45 - this video's description and there'll be
01:46 - time codes and links to all the projects
01:48 - that hopefully we're gonna walk around
01:50 - and see and then if you're watching this
01:52 - as an archive and you're like I don't
01:53 - want to watch this two-hour or however
01:54 - long it turns out to be thing State
01:56 - there should also be at some point soon
01:58 - an edited version with nicer audio
02:01 - because I'm separately recording audio
02:02 - into this mic and I just want to make
02:04 - sure I'm really recording I'm really
02:06 - recording I'm really recording okay so
02:08 - let's uh come on let's go this way well
02:11 - you don't need to run
02:12 - terrifying all right so the show is
02:16 - barely just begun
02:18 - oh let's come over here and play this
02:21 - Lucas can we look at your project so
02:24 - first first can you say your name and
02:27 - just tell us a few sentences about what
02:28 - you made and you could take a minute to
02:30 - finish we're getting everybody early my
02:34 - name is Lucas Cheung I made a
02:37 - interactive video game called rocket
02:39 - slinger
02:40 - it was meant to teach people about
02:42 - orbital dynamics and yeah take a look
02:46 - okay can I try to play it please do okay
02:49 - I'm gonna put this microphone how can I
02:50 - hand you this microphone you can talk
02:52 - into it if you want okay so we built a
02:55 - physical controller
02:55 - it measures angle and velocity and the
03:01 - input device is a hinge that is attached
03:06 - to this box and as well as a pinball
03:10 - plunger it's plywood and there's a
03:20 - there's a pipe there at the software oh
03:22 - so the graphics are all rendered using
03:25 - p5.js and with some of the physics and
03:29 - collisions being
03:32 - made using Madara Jas I love the little
03:42 - particle versus
03:48 - yeah it's just as satisfying to crash
03:51 - the Rockets as it is to uh I'm really
03:54 - trying to do it I'm just terrible at it
03:56 - alright awesome Thank You Lucas okay all
04:02 - right all right eat I can we take a look
04:09 - at your project here yes so first come
04:11 - close to this camera so people can hear
04:13 - you
04:13 - no it's not that the audio for the live
04:17 - stream the audio for the live stream
04:19 - isn't so great
04:20 - but this is recording better audio so
04:23 - tell us your name and about your project
04:25 - okay my name is ty my project is Paulie
04:30 - note which is a sequencer a web-based
04:34 - multiplayer sequencer it is playing now
04:39 - and it's clean do you want to start
04:41 - making something yeah sure let's do it
04:43 - okay so it's it's now on the touchscreen
04:46 - so you can like do something like this
04:48 - and these are different instruments that
04:51 - you kind of pick and then you can put
04:57 - them on the world here
05:03 - so the color and the shape to find the
05:05 - instrument yes the color and the shape
05:08 - is the instrument and the velocity
05:12 - determine the height determines the
05:14 - amplitude so the volume of each tone so
05:18 - let's say I want this now this this
05:21 - shape is my favorite so I will just tap
05:25 - on the screen here and now I've added
05:29 - this that's at another
05:34 - another one yeah and it's completely a
05:49 - multiplayer so what happens here is
05:53 - going to be here the same pattern and we
05:56 - can play together anything like that
05:57 - yeah amazing fun a lot of fun what tools
06:01 - did you use to build them this is in
06:04 - JavaScript two libraries specifically
06:06 - three Jas and tone Jas for the music
06:10 - wonderful great job
06:12 - what's it has anybody done anything that
06:14 - really surprised you yeah with it yes
06:16 - it's it's it's it was fun because I was
06:18 - kind of playing like doing crazy stuff
06:21 - like putting stuff like without even
06:24 - thinking what's gonna be and then
06:26 - someone came earlier yesterday and he
06:29 - was like okay I'm gonna use this as a
06:31 - base and he just layered the baseline
06:33 - and then created the melody and it was
06:35 - like wow you totally got it it was
06:39 - amazing great thank you so much thank
06:41 - you let's see where we can what's what's
06:45 - going on over here can we can we check
06:51 - out both of your projects we'll come
06:53 - back to you in a minute Eric okay you're
06:55 - setting up we'll come back okay five
06:58 - minutes that's all right let's let's go
07:02 - around this way let's go over here well
07:10 - don't pick I think we got a
07:11 - sound-related project here are you are
07:13 - you are you are you operational okay
07:17 - you're operational excellent all right
07:19 - we found an operational project okay
07:23 - oh boys we're gonna have an issue with
07:26 - the headphone project no I just the live
07:31 - viewers won't be able to hear but I will
07:33 - I can maybe narrate what's happening
07:36 - I'll talk to ya
08:01 - what's that right oh go inside here
08:30 - [Music]
08:40 - all right I got to know what just
08:42 - happened what just happened
08:44 - so hopefully you just have to tell me
08:47 - your name hi my name is Brandon
08:49 - hopefully you just had a moment we're
08:51 - trying to sort of show that partying is
08:53 - not just a silly way to escape but
08:55 - actually something serious a way to find
08:57 - community a way to find identity and
09:00 - create a set of norms that sort of stand
09:02 - in opposition to the ones that we are
09:04 - told we have to live by in everyday life
09:07 - so the piece is called
09:08 - 5:00 to 9:00 so yeah and hopefully you
09:12 - can realize that with just what we've
09:13 - made here that you know partying is just
09:16 - a state of mind and you can even bring
09:18 - it with you to your 9:00 to 5:00 I want
09:20 - to come back and see when this room is
09:21 - totally full of people to see to see
09:24 - what it's like yeah yeah but if you do
09:26 - have you had multiple people in the
09:28 - dancing so on so people people get in
09:31 - there sometimes with strangers sometimes
09:33 - with friends or parents and you know
09:36 - they they put on a good show what and
09:39 - what are you writing here I'm writing
09:41 - about partying I'm where I'm doing
09:43 - recent serious research here we have
09:45 - like a variety of books that went into
09:48 - the making of the piece and yeah I'm
09:52 - just sort of part of the performance
09:54 - here showing the contrast inside and out
09:57 - all right cool great job thanks for
09:59 - hanging okay I hope everybody enjoyed
10:03 - that my little time embarrassing myself
10:05 - as much as possible okay let's see where
10:09 - no no nope nope
10:12 - oh all right Eric is ready okay
10:15 - wonderful so it's a little dark over
10:17 - here but I think we could see you so can
10:20 - you tell me your name even though I know
10:21 - it but for the viewing audience and tell
10:23 - give us a few sentences about your
10:25 - project okay so my name is Terry
10:27 - Gutierrez and I just completed my first
10:29 - year at ITP my piece is entitled
10:32 - misunderstood it's an interactive
10:33 - installation where you can place on this
10:36 - hoodie and when you flip up the hood you
10:38 - hear this audio narrative of a young
10:40 - black
10:40 - encounter with the police officer so
10:43 - it's a two-part narrative the first part
10:45 - is me telling my actual story so when I
10:48 - was 13 years old I was stopped by a
10:50 - white police officer
10:51 - so I'm recounting that in the first
10:52 - aspect of the narrative the second
10:54 - aspect is more speculative aspect of
10:56 - like what could have happened so I'm
10:58 - tired with the piece misunderstood
11:00 - because I think it's oftentimes at that
11:02 - point of misunderstanding where these
11:05 - incidents of police brutality become
11:07 - deadly so if you would like to you can
11:10 - actually try it on and experience it
11:12 - okay
11:12 - I definitely would like to
11:44 - you can stand in America and when I qu
11:46 - you can flip the hood up and that would
11:48 - activate one second
11:59 - what's he hearing on earth so right now
12:03 - what he's hearing is me talking about
12:06 - this particular experience so again when
12:09 - I was 13 I got stopped by a police
12:10 - officer so I was riding down the street
12:12 - on my bike coming from the store and
12:15 - this police officer pulled up to me and
12:17 - essentially told me several times to get
12:19 - off my bike after refusing the first
12:21 - time because I didn't do anything she
12:23 - became more and more aggressive in her
12:25 - approach so essentially after that she I
12:28 - got off my bike and she pushed me about
12:30 - the second aspect is told from a
12:34 - mother's perspective and again this is a
12:36 - more speculative story so you hear from
12:39 - that particular person's point of view
12:41 - of what happened or what transpired post
12:44 - what happened to me
12:48 - so
12:55 - I guess I can you know I don't know
13:01 - ya know I hear the whole thing okay so
13:04 - so yes so the reason I incorporated the
13:08 - mirror is because I wanted users to
13:11 - really be alone with their own thoughts
13:15 - and see where they're at just in
13:19 - relation to this project whether they do
13:21 - identify with someone who's black or
13:23 - brown or if they don't and if they do
13:27 - you know they had that internal
13:29 - conversation with their particular
13:32 - experience and if they don't they have
13:33 - it with them without those experiences
13:43 - he's always halfway through experience
14:10 - [Music]
14:23 - what's in the hoodie you can walk you
14:29 - can walk around and out and come back
14:58 - oh there's the ceiling look at this
15:03 - amazing gimbal
15:11 - that needs mirror and not yet nothing
15:15 - shows that
15:18 - this
15:42 - how's it going over here
16:13 - Oh
16:58 - Caleb alike
17:11 - so wow that's very intense yeah I first
17:17 - thing I want to say is that I think
17:18 - you're an excellent storyteller like
17:20 - your voice the quality of the recording
17:22 - and the way that you use sound I'm doing
17:25 - probably what the opposite of what I
17:26 - should do in a live stream which is
17:27 - experiencing so they go through
17:28 - headphones so I'm sorry that those of
17:30 - you watching couldn't experience that
17:31 - yourself I think that was really
17:34 - impactful the way that you told the
17:36 - story and especially used sound and so
17:39 - what did you make the decision to have
17:40 - the sort of speculative narrative turn
17:43 - into a different person's voice the
17:44 - voice of your mother I'm assuming yes
17:46 - yes so one of my friends actually did
17:49 - that voice over and I just thought I
17:52 - wanted to be true to my narrative and
17:54 - and make that distinction clear so you
17:58 - can also like feel that the second
18:00 - aspect of the narrative is a little more
18:01 - poetic in some sense but I really wanted
18:04 - to just capture you know close reality
18:07 - that could have happened you know so in
18:08 - my case I was fortunate enough to walk
18:10 - away but in many other cases these young
18:12 - black and brown men aren't but yeah I
18:15 - just want to give a different
18:16 - perspective just to bring in different
18:19 - audience and a different feel for the
18:21 - piece as well
18:22 - well it's really great that you're using
18:23 - interactive media to explore these
18:25 - issues and problems that are in our
18:27 - society today as well as created
18:30 - experience for other people who I didn't
18:32 - grow up with a similar experience to
18:33 - have some empathy and to sort of like
18:35 - you know obviously it's different being
18:38 - standing here at ITP with headphones on
18:39 - yeah but to be able to have some level
18:42 - of being in touch with that experience
18:43 - that you had it's really great I also
18:46 - just wanted I thought that I didn't
18:47 - realize there was gonna be like tactile
18:48 - feedback and that really surprised me
18:50 - and I think that's there was very loud
18:53 - gunshots and I would feel vibrating in
18:56 - the in parts of the hoodie which really
18:58 - you know I I do I like I probably
18:59 - shouldn't be listening to this anymore
19:00 - because I'm doing this like live stream
19:02 - but it was I just didn't want to didn't
19:04 - want to take it off so there's really in
19:05 - fact that's great thank you great work
19:07 - Derek okay great okay so let's keep
19:12 - moving are your sculptures moving
19:17 - oh hi do you know nothing okay just see
19:24 - the sound let's come over and look at
19:25 - these this oppa this is another sound
19:27 - project no I got to go away from
19:29 - something the sound project all right
19:31 - tell us your name and tell us about your
19:34 - project and when you see here they are
19:41 - five podiums and they are invisible
19:44 - sculpture on top of each of the podium
19:47 - so when you say invisible can you unpack
19:50 - what that means exactly we only see a
19:55 - really small amount of electromagnetic
19:59 - spectrum and I wanted to explore with
20:02 - the individual materials and so I chose
20:05 - to use sounds smell and temperature so
20:09 - people can think their different senses
20:11 - to interact with the sculpture and
20:14 - perceive some boundaries and form of the
20:17 - sculpture so unlike traditional
20:18 - sculpture that I would look at with my
20:20 - eyes this is sculpture that I could
20:23 - experience through sound through feeling
20:25 - through touch through just sort of
20:27 - smelling depending on as I move around
20:29 - I'm getting the smell of the sculpture
20:31 - association that's well I think it's
20:33 - gonna be pretty hard to demonstrate over
20:35 - the live but maybe we could try you want
20:37 - to pick one that we could try that might
20:39 - work for us to fear here and people when
20:52 - they touch the surface of the sphere
20:54 - they hear the sound like
20:58 - and they can finally perceive the form
21:02 - although there is nothing feasible like
21:09 - three layers of discs on top of each
21:12 - other and it's also the same idea but
21:15 - people can feel I can simulate and the
21:24 - third one is made of heat and I
21:26 - positioned infrared heating elements
21:29 - inside so it seems like there's nothing
21:32 - here but there is actually his sculpture
21:34 - which might look like this and people
21:36 - can feel their head I'm getting warm and
21:39 - when you see the heat camera that shows
21:41 - a thermal thermal image of this sphere
21:45 - and when I'm touching this invisible his
21:50 - sculpture my hand becomes brighter which
21:53 - means that I'm touching this warmth of
21:56 - this sculpture and this is may the cool
22:00 - air and people can so this is like a
22:03 - hollow cylinder shape that I designed
22:05 - and you can feel the cool air on top of
22:08 - the screen and they can try to feel the
22:12 - shape and the fifth one is made of smell
22:16 - there is some stinky stuff inside and
22:20 - imagine the air is from I can like smell
22:23 - it I have a bad cold so I'm not able to
22:28 - totally smell it but I definitely can't
22:30 - smell it top of here made of smell after
22:37 - the experience they make they make
22:41 - invisible sculpture visible by making
22:43 - these sculptures and people can have
22:46 - this like little amount of clay and they
22:49 - shape whatever they saw so this is uh I
22:53 - got some from yesterday and I only left
22:55 - some that I
22:56 - and these are collective perception of
22:59 - the invisible sculpture that people may
23:01 - see the sculpture one sound and on are
23:03 - some sheets cool air and smell and you
23:06 - can see all people saw sort of similar
23:09 - about different things great Thank You
23:11 - yourself okay let's come back over this
23:16 - way
23:17 - ready oh that's our actually so let's
23:19 - look over here loud yeah so you have to
23:25 - speak up because the phone microphone is
23:27 - very poor at getting the audio so can
23:30 - you tell me your name and a little bit
23:32 - about your project and then afterwards
23:34 - we'll shoot some video of the project my
23:35 - name is sebastian rallies and my project
23:37 - is in biases that live it's a website
23:39 - it's very website by physical ecosystem
23:43 - it's an ecosystem that combines
23:44 - single-celled organisms with internet
23:47 - bots and together they combine they
23:51 - start creating a symbiotic relationship
23:53 - where they both start defending or
23:56 - benefit benefiting from each other here
23:59 - you can see some of the physical
24:00 - components it has a bioreactor that has
24:03 - living cells inside of it and there is
24:06 - also microscope live streaming the
24:10 - sample of the cells in the system and
24:13 - these are connected to internet bots as
24:16 - the bots arrived to the honeypot server
24:19 - they start really seeing food in the
24:20 - tanks of the cells and the cells also
24:22 - control the gates of a honeypot making
24:24 - it more attractive or less attractive to
24:25 - sales is there a URL that people can go
24:28 - to right now to see it running yeah yeah
24:30 - your ass is symbiosis dot live and once
24:34 - you get there you can control the
24:35 - microscope yourself and play around
24:36 - explore the two worlds colliding and
24:39 - interact me wonderful thank you let's
24:42 - try to get some nice footage of the
24:45 - different a speices
24:52 - somebody somebody put in there
25:14 - okay let's keep moving all right come
25:17 - this way okay hello can we check this
25:31 - out now okay so why don't you you guys
25:34 - want to stand together and so what we're
25:38 - gonna do is first we're just gonna have
25:40 - you tell us about the project and then
25:43 - we'll shoot some video of the of the
25:44 - project itself afterwards so if you if
25:47 - you want to there's four of you I'm
25:48 - gonna try to use this microphone first
25:50 - tell me all of your names and I'm Asha
25:54 - and this is our project search divides
25:57 - us so search of Isis is a project made
26:00 - for playful communications of serious
26:01 - research so what we tried to do was take
26:03 - a serious research topic which was bias
26:06 - and search engine optimization and then
26:08 - communicate that playfully and so for
26:11 - this class we were tasked to collaborate
26:13 - with an NYU professor and use their
26:15 - research so we were working with dr.
26:18 - Charlton McIlwain and he's concerned
26:20 - with how the way that the Internet's
26:22 - architecture currently works today limit
26:24 - and constrains what we actually see and
26:26 - this can create eventually segregation a
26:28 - problematic way so we've created a kind
26:30 - of a fun game to express that let's
26:35 - strip yeah let's play it okay should I
26:37 - try to play it oh my goodness all right
26:40 - what do i do first
26:47 - Oh should I oak boy the idea behind this
26:57 - setup was we're taking something that's
26:59 - normally a very private experience of
27:00 - black box and making it this large
27:02 - public experience you don't want to put
27:04 - your real information that's fine
27:11 - I'm going so far with my real
27:14 - information I'm actually moving right
27:19 - now so this is very useful no this is
27:29 - what the search engine thinks you should
27:31 - live based on your profile has found one
27:33 - recommendation for you well this is
27:37 - exciting I really like I'm kind of a I
27:38 - like to gamble so this is good
27:54 - and what would the search engine
27:56 - recommend you instead so now I'm back at
28:01 - the beginning that's great Wow I love
28:03 - this it's so much like a the way that
28:05 - you physically constructed this it
28:07 - really feels like a genuine game show
28:09 - mechanic in this like wonderful sort of
28:12 - playful way but it's such a serious in
28:15 - topic as well so yeah so I think you've
28:18 - really definitely succeeded at the
28:19 - playful communication aspect great work
28:23 - I mean love all the pieces of the design
28:25 - and the way that physical construction
28:27 - works amazing great job all right let's
28:32 - see here all right can we check out this
28:35 - project here we'll come down the line
28:37 - all right tell us your name and tell us
28:40 - about your project hi my name is
28:41 - Chauncey Chan and my project is called
28:44 - face blurred and judging by the name and
28:48 - the logo you probably can tell is about
28:50 - face book so if you stand on this sweet
28:53 - pole and look at my camera yes it will
28:59 - see your face has been blurred and a
29:02 - screen shot has been stable there and
29:04 - they will be downloaded on my laptop and
29:06 - then later I will sorry
29:10 - put them on a Facebook page called
29:14 - face blurred and all these photos are
29:17 - from yesterday
29:22 - yes aspect to this page so yeah this is
29:29 - my
29:30 - pixel-by-pixel homework and it's a image
29:33 - processing project and the reason why
29:37 - I'm doing it is because I feel like we
29:39 - are using Facebook for connect with
29:42 - people to share our stories and emotions
29:47 - just like data in their database for
29:51 - their business so I feel we have the
29:53 - personalized about Facebook so I've made
29:56 - this thing to tell my point and you can
29:59 - tell from this picture you can what can
30:01 - you tell you can't just can tell it's a
30:03 - maybe oh man and living in New York City
30:06 - you don't know what happened about him
30:09 - you don't know his story you don't know
30:11 - his emotions and that's just like a
30:14 - wonderful great job I really love the
30:16 - way that you put the logitech webcam
30:18 - inside of this guy at first I was like
30:20 - wow did you hack one of these outdoor
30:21 - surveillance cameras and runs no you
30:23 - just actually put the webcam inside it
30:24 - which is a really nice touch wonderful
30:27 - job great job
30:29 - okay okay can you tell us your name and
30:32 - a few sentences about your project first
30:37 - year student timeline of the far future
30:41 - so it's an interactive website that
30:45 - visualizes the future events so all the
30:50 - data here is pulled from Wikipedia using
30:53 - API and if users scroll they can see the
30:59 - how many years from now
31:01 - and they click the label below they can
31:06 - see the detailed events that happens
31:09 - like sixty thousand years from now and
31:14 - this is pretty horizontally long website
31:19 - so if user Scrolls more the background
31:24 - changes to the dark darker color and
31:29 - there's a lot of information here and
31:33 - there's an visuals like interaction
31:37 - which is relevant to the events for
31:42 - example this event is about the black
31:44 - hole so I made the black hole visuals
31:47 - and pretty same here and there's a
31:52 - simple interaction here and this is
31:56 - about Hawking radiation process so I
31:59 - made visuals like that and if they go
32:03 - more they'll see that is like this very
32:09 - far
32:09 - news from now and this is the last
32:14 - events for us it's free long is this
32:20 - online
32:20 - is this a website that people can go to
32:22 - online right yeah so this is the the URL
32:24 - so if you type www.blender.org and see
32:30 - these great wonderful great job thank
32:32 - you okay let's go to this front room up
32:35 - here
32:36 - we don't by the way this is let's just
32:39 - stop and look at this gym is not here oh
32:42 - she was here okay
32:43 - alright alright tell us your name and
32:46 - tell us about you a few sentences about
32:47 - your project okay so my name is Jim
32:49 - Schmitz and this is my Google Streetview
32:52 - style of transfer project the idea is to
32:55 - take pictures from Google Street View
32:57 - and then apply a style transfer
32:59 - algorithm to all the frames to make an
33:02 - animation so it looks like you're flying
33:03 - through
33:04 - animated painting as opposed to the
33:07 - boring street view Google Street View
33:09 - pictures well not boring but there if
33:13 - it's a cloudy day and bad lighting then
33:15 - the pictures don't look so nice so I
33:16 - wanted to make them look a lot more
33:18 - interesting by and artistic in this case
33:21 - the highway in Idaho is being
33:24 - transformed a combination of the seated
33:28 - nude by Picasso and this other
33:30 - photograph by cat Conor photographer
33:33 - amazing so do you this is we're just
33:35 - seeing like the rendered results here
33:38 - yeah but inconceivably this could
33:40 - eventually at some point happen in real
33:41 - time with what if you've trained the
33:43 - model in advance yes
33:45 - what I'm doing is different from what
33:46 - Coach is doing where he has a pre
33:47 - trained model over here it's doing an
33:50 - optimization for every single frame and
33:52 - it takes about five or ten minutes to do
33:54 - it your single frame so this video is
33:56 - actually maybe 20 seconds longer today
33:58 - than it was yesterday because it was
34:00 - running up until 10:00 a.m. one of the
34:02 - things that I won't point out to you
34:03 - that's really interesting is it uses a
34:06 - optical flow model to make sure that the
34:09 - way that things are stylized in one
34:11 - frame is consistent with how its
34:13 - stylized in the next frame so you'll
34:14 - notice that some of these trees and that
34:17 - are zipping by and the sign for example
34:20 - in the car it stays the same color from
34:22 - one frame to the next and that's
34:24 - important to avoid any kind of you want
34:26 - to avoid any kind of flickering and I
34:27 - think it makes the the result wonderful
34:31 - job great job thank you okay
34:34 - let's come around into here and let's
34:38 - see what we can look at in here oh we've
34:40 - got to come look at the robots over here
34:42 - you ready for us or no need a few
34:48 - minutes
34:49 - okay let's come look over here first all
34:53 - right can you tell us your are you are
34:56 - you available to show us your project
34:58 - okay tell us your name and a couple
35:00 - sentences about your project sure
35:01 - rapidfire my name is Nate this is my
35:04 - thesis project it's called open kinetics
35:06 - it's an attempt to make a low cost kit
35:07 - for teaching electronics and code yeah
35:09 - and so it's like moving bass so it's
35:11 - like your do you make a motion
35:13 - controller and used to play games
35:15 - and and I think I could you know it was
35:17 - to sell this pricing for like under 30
35:18 - bucks which would be really affordable
35:19 - so fantastic now do you I know in your
35:21 - thesis presentation you showed some
35:23 - demos of different projects people can
35:25 - make like this pong here can yeah
35:26 - can you play one of them for us or okay
35:28 - or can I play it yeah - you can use this
35:34 - controller to move this panel on the on
35:36 - the left hand side just move up and down
35:38 - so it's gesture based so point it yes
35:41 - you hold like this okay I'm terrible at
35:59 - this
36:13 - are you playing player too
36:26 - I'm gonna lose on purpose there we go
36:28 - all right great job so so just to be
36:31 - clear the idea for this is that this is
36:33 - like a kit not I mean that someone would
36:36 - I put it together and then it would
36:38 - there it would come with some of these
36:39 - pre-made games you put it together and
36:41 - maybe a little online like in the
36:42 - browser so so you build the kit and you
36:45 - play games and you'd make your own games
36:47 - and that's right
36:47 - yeah fantastic great work okay all right
36:52 - can we see your lights all right tell us
36:57 - your name and a bit about your project
36:59 - hi my name is you know and this is my
37:01 - thesis project called Adamic Eve light I
37:03 - created a two series of augmented
37:05 - literary so this is creating argument to
37:08 - the light that can control the real
37:10 - light so let me show you some demo so
37:13 - after a few seconds is scan the object
37:16 - and walls and then I'm gonna blow into
37:24 - once again all right so my application
37:33 - generates argument to the lighting that
37:35 - can connect us and our light birth more
37:38 - seamlessly and more meaningfully and let
37:40 - me show you some second maybe this will
37:47 - be easier to capture with the iPad this
37:49 - is like multiplayer experience so I need
37:52 - a participant yeah
37:57 - so can you open this application and
38:04 - then okay yeah okay can you use
38:12 - vertically yeah so we need to scan the
38:20 - surface first until the ring is really
38:24 - strange so it means the application
38:32 - recognize the surface so once we touch
38:36 - the surface once anywhere so it's
38:39 - connecting you and me and this object so
38:41 - now we can play with this light by
38:43 - touching anywhere on the screen so you
38:46 - can see my creation and I can see your
38:48 - creation so this is basically started
38:52 - from
38:52 - how can recent lighting technology mimic
38:54 - the ancient Allah heat technology so I
38:56 - was inspired by campfire which
38:59 - emotionally connect us and have a sense
39:01 - of community so we designed this missile
39:07 - lighting technology to feel more
39:08 - emotional and thank you it's beautiful
39:12 - it's really magical I don't know how
39:14 - much this is can easily be transmitted
39:16 - via my phone's camera that experience of
39:19 - it and so just to be clear as you're
39:21 - adding light via the AR display
39:23 - you're also affecting the actual
39:25 - lighting fixture itself exactly that's
39:28 - why I'm going to make some combination
39:31 - between the physical lighting and
39:32 - augmented lighting and our mobile device
39:34 - great job thank you you thank you okay
39:39 - can we talk to you about your project
39:41 - now okay so tell us your name and a
39:44 - little bout your project and then after
39:45 - you say a few sentences we'll get some
39:47 - video of the actual
39:51 - you can tell this is my project perfect
39:55 - housewife it's a true kid desire for
39:58 - myself I imagine if I become housewives
40:02 - what I got a face I gonna pick out my
40:05 - baby and do a lot of housework so I
40:08 - trying to like make two key to help me
40:12 - to solve most of the problem and in the
40:15 - end I have a live performance it's like
40:18 - I I display a low like a housewife and
40:22 - make every every machines help me to do
40:26 - the housework and I play that I'm
40:29 - perfect but actually they the Machine
40:32 - keep broker and I have to fix them you
40:36 - know so it's hard to be perfect growing
40:39 - your life I trying to like through my
40:42 - project to discuss of other people's
40:45 - respect of the household labor because I
40:48 - feel like people ignore their household
40:52 - labor when comparing to other types of
40:54 - labor so I hope you can get some idea of
40:58 - how we yeah wonderful let's try to look
41:05 - let's try to look at some of these you
41:10 - can help me to like call my naughty baby
41:14 - to sleep and also allow me to play on my
41:17 - phone
41:22 - single video you will cook on me like
41:26 - that
41:26 - yeah yeah I used to like live all
41:32 - principle to indicate that the balance
41:36 - of the life and the work since like me
41:40 - this last one is my favorite by the way
41:43 - good machine so this one is like it will
41:47 - type good to encourage me to doing the
41:51 - housework like why my Hospital at work I
41:55 - think I need someone to like encourage
41:58 - me I'm finishing the work and there's a
42:01 - satire aspect of this is that correct
42:03 - yeah I love this one so much I need one
42:07 - that just types this dot this period
42:10 - this period because that's what I always
42:11 - forget when in programming wonderful
42:14 - these are really delightful and kind of
42:16 - crazy in the most beautiful wonderful
42:18 - black thank you thank you okay great
42:21 - all right let's let's go around I don't
42:27 - know where what else can we see here
42:30 - well okay let's this programmable air
42:33 - over here okay oh yes this is neat we
42:36 - can talk to Nietzsche okay
42:39 - oh we should look at this Oh top can we
42:45 - talk to Ken so just give us a your name
42:47 - and a quick summary your project make
42:49 - sure this is still recording all right
42:56 - okay yeah look into the camera say your
42:58 - name and a couple cents about your price
42:59 - okay I what's up Tara and this is my
43:01 - project
43:02 - I'm with Chuck Taylor and this is my
43:04 - project philosophy Megan you could just
43:06 - tell us about it then we'll get you
43:07 - operating it okay so basically what's
43:09 - happening here is you can I'm trying to
43:12 - simulate conversations between a user
43:14 - and that philosopher technically what's
43:17 - it what it's doing is its
43:19 - trying to look for responses in a
43:23 - certain corpus of effects based on the
43:26 - context of the question that is being
43:27 - asked and my reason for doing this is so
43:30 - that philosophy as a subject can be more
43:32 - approachable like it can be intimidating
43:34 - for an individual to start reading
43:36 - lengthy books of philosophy sound this I
43:39 - made this interface so that perhaps it
43:42 - can be more approachable or just final
43:44 - and so I can actually speak into the
43:46 - microphone yeah and it's gonna speak
43:48 - back to me but we're also gonna see the
43:49 - results here yes yes okay but like right
43:55 - let's try it let's let's let's try with
43:58 - the microphone okay all right no should
44:00 - i type it what do you think let's try it
44:01 - with a microphone good morning I'm gonna
44:09 - I'm gonna read the reply how I thank my
44:11 - morning dream that I thus at today's
44:13 - dawn Wade the world
44:14 - yesterday towards evening there spoke to
44:16 - me my stillest our I'll let everybody
44:18 - read the rest huh that's beautiful but
44:21 - what does it mean Oh Wheatsville oh I
44:27 - see what you mean so actually what you
44:29 - can hear is that but I'm gonna put this
44:34 - Microsoft ooh the microphone so this
44:39 - will get recorded
44:41 - [Music]
44:43 - wonderful I I kind of I need to come
44:45 - back and have a much longer conversation
44:46 - with Nietzsche cuz I got a lot of
44:48 - questions great job all right
44:54 - Ellen can you tell us about your project
44:56 - okay so just say your name and a couple
44:59 - sentences about your project and then
45:01 - we'll get some footage of people
45:02 - interacting with antastic
45:03 - so my name is Ellen Nichols and I
45:05 - created an interactive cubist mirror I'm
45:07 - calling it the painting mirror because
45:09 - if you stand close enough to it you'll
45:11 - see fragmented reflections of yourself
45:13 - and you can move those pieces around and
45:15 - create your own portrait fantastic okay
45:18 - let's get some live footage of people
45:21 - interacting with it jump in front
45:33 - look at this those studied with the
45:35 - camera does it like so this is just its
45:44 - left over in the position from where
45:46 - people were before it's live video
45:50 - moving into the shapes if you find
45:52 - something that you like you can double
45:54 - tap the screen and preserve it on
45:55 - Instagram and pick it up later
46:08 - so that saves it fantastic great job
46:14 - okay hi can you tell us about your
46:20 - projects yes so say your names gives a
46:25 - couple senses about the project we have
46:26 - to put each other okay I'm not even on
46:29 - this and I'm cher Chaudhary and we're
46:31 - gonna divide this time so this is living
46:34 - canvas and this is like data
46:35 - visualization with living organisms and
46:38 - we want to focus our attention on
46:40 - microbes and microbiome and we believe
46:43 - there's no love without your microbiome
46:45 - and we wanted to see that love United be
46:47 - because we are such a huge community so
46:49 - what we need is like we trace people's
46:51 - paths on the board and we cross that
46:53 - information with some samples that we
46:55 - took from different parts of the bill
46:57 - for the floor with bacteria we can study
47:00 - information to see how it looked like so
47:03 - this is 10 I to be students in just one
47:05 - day and what we're doing is like with
47:07 - reading consonants so places where we
47:10 - know bacteria live we put some also to
47:13 - protect the plants we're using plans
47:14 - instead of microbes because we don't
47:16 - want people to feel like a little bit
47:18 - though appeal by it and we wanted to
47:20 - have like a new to start a conversation
47:21 - about microbes and eventually what we
47:24 - want is to have a complete automatic
47:26 - system where we could trace people
47:28 - whereabouts and printed in real life and
47:30 - the reason we're doing this is because
47:32 - eventually we're moving to Berkeley and
47:34 - we want to have like a live in memory of
47:36 - how it looks like to be on the floor and
47:38 - like this huge monster that all our
47:41 - microbes are and reducing like robotics
47:45 - further which is so no this is what the
47:50 - is where we're having the interaction in
47:52 - today's project which is that whenever
47:54 - people are walking over the paths if
47:56 - there are people who will belong to ITP
47:57 - then they can they can trace their paths
48:00 - on the software over here and if you
48:04 - don't belong to ITP you can walk around
48:06 - come back
48:07 - and then have your parts drawn as to
48:08 - where you walked and where you moved
48:10 - around and after you've done all of that
48:13 - then from making the robot print the
48:17 - seats for you also the best part is that
48:19 - the robot moves on an XY also that but
48:21 - then you work with the robot and when
48:24 - it's moving on your part you are
48:26 - planting your own seeds and I know that
48:29 - it ends up looking like goop right now
48:30 - but what's happening is that these are
48:33 - multiple paths that are overlapping so
48:35 - when they do start growing which will
48:37 - take like a few days we're going to have
48:40 - living memories of the second-last maybe
48:42 - spring show I love the way that you used
48:47 - this robotic arm basically to like drop
48:52 - these seeds amazing great job okay
49:00 - oh hello okay let's look at this one as
49:02 - we go programmable air yes let's all
49:04 - yeah you got to explain what this is hi
49:05 - hi I'm a table and this is programmable
49:09 - air it's an open-source
49:11 - pneumatics control kit for makers to
49:14 - play around with pneumatics an
49:15 - inflatable soft robotics fire can you
49:19 - demonstrate it for us all right let's
49:20 - see over here so let's meet Kim Kim
49:24 - wanted to make this sculpture which is
49:27 - which is an art piece which as you
49:30 - approach it it blows a bubble and then
49:32 - it sucks it back in when you move away
49:35 - from it and right now what it's doing is
49:38 - if you look closely the balloon is sort
49:41 - of breathing and that's because there's
49:43 - a small hole in the balloon and it's
49:46 - trying to maintain a constant pressure
49:47 - inside the balloon but I can blow it up
49:50 - and let it shrink back as well there's
49:54 - another example over here we have a nice
49:56 - vacuum gripper which is nice and soft
49:58 - but then I pull a vacuum and it becomes
50:01 - very tough so I can use it to pick up so
50:05 - I can use it to pick up irregularly
50:08 - shaped objects
50:12 - I think it's overheated yeah so this is
50:17 - a completely open source project all the
50:18 - details are on the github and have been
50:20 - for the past few months working on us
50:22 - some examples so if you want to see
50:25 - that's the vacuum dripper just working
50:29 - like picking up irregularly shaped
50:31 - objects or the same vacuum thing can be
50:34 - used for pick and placing electronics or
50:39 - for the Rube Goldberg machine here at
50:41 - ITP I blew up a balloon to drop a hammer
50:45 - on top of a sculpture because why not or
50:48 - you can use just the pressure sensor
50:50 - which is there for feedback to detect
50:52 - impacts for example if you take this
50:54 - tube and wrap it around a bumper car
50:56 - then when it hits something you can
50:59 - detect that impact with a pressure spike
51:01 - very easily and that's a irregularly
51:04 - shaped large impact sensor or you know
51:06 - you can get more artsy and make a
51:08 - airbrush because you have a high
51:10 - pressure air source so yeah all the
51:13 - details are on the github and I hope to
51:16 - make this kit available to makers over
51:18 - the next few months wonderful thank you
51:20 - so much ok let's go around this way
51:24 - we're gonna see some projects in here
51:27 - we're gonna maybe get in touch with the
51:29 - universe can we get in touch with the
51:31 - universe okay would you labor we'll look
51:36 - at this map first from Anita okay will
51:40 - you tell us your name and give us a
51:41 - couple sentences about your project my
51:49 - name is Anita Bob Ozzie and my project
51:51 - is about energy was actually for my
51:54 - energy class it's an artistic
51:56 - representation of the different energy
51:59 - sources around the world
52:01 - so from this screen you can see what the
52:05 - different colors represent so the yellow
52:07 - LEDs represent a solar
52:10 - the blue represent hydro red represents
52:13 - oil and then greenest biofuels white is
52:17 - wind energy so it's um it's just on an
52:22 - artistic piece and so from here you can
52:26 - see what different countries you is what
52:28 - different form of energy as yes as a
52:32 - source of energy fantastic I think we
52:34 - should can we take a look at behind it
52:36 - as well it all came together so much
52:48 - happens in the back just to show this
52:51 - beauty at the front wonderful
53:11 - okay Thank You Anita okay we're ready
53:14 - for the talking stone all right
53:16 - so first just tell us your name and a
53:18 - few centons about your project and then
53:19 - we'll demonstrate great my name is
53:21 - Roland Arnold and I am interested in
53:24 - true randomness because computational
53:27 - randomness is kind of fake I don't want
53:30 - this so I was interested how can I
53:32 - create true renders and how can I make
53:34 - true Rendon is somehow a spiritual
53:35 - experience to people so I created a
53:38 - stone that when you knock at it and you
53:43 - align with true randomness of the
53:45 - radioactive particles inside that stone
53:48 - when the patterns match it knocks back
53:51 - at you so basically the universe talks
53:54 - back to you because the true randomness
53:56 - is kind of a force in the universe okay
53:58 - I want to talk to the universe the
54:00 - universe the universe is talking to me
54:25 - I'm very very in tune with the universe
54:37 - [Laughter]
54:40 - wonderful I this I love the whole setup
54:44 - here I was saying earlier I just love
54:45 - the details of this little hammer and
54:47 - the nice little spot for it the stone
54:49 - rising out I love how you put this
54:51 - behind it it's amazing because there is
54:55 - a Geiger counter a Geiger counter inside
54:57 - which basically tracks about 20% of the
55:01 - decaying particles inside the stone and
55:03 - the rest is universal background
55:05 - radiation my solar flare whatever so
55:08 - yeah this is this is the talking
55:11 - great fantastic all right I wonder if we
55:14 - should take this moment to sneak
55:15 - downstairs what do you think how you
55:17 - doing are you feeling
55:19 - you can do more no it's okay Bobo will
55:22 - be so glad to be able to hear somebody
55:24 - you can go you think you've got the
55:26 - energy to do some more all right okay so
55:30 - we are now in the hallway stairwell of
55:34 - 721 Broadway I hope that this experience
55:39 - for those of you viewing it is somewhat
55:41 - worthwhile I know the audio is an ideal
55:44 - hopefully this is actually we probably
55:49 - just lost it in the stairway okay let's
55:54 - come around this way hello there how are
55:58 - you having a nice sit okay
56:02 - let's see what can we I don't even know
56:03 - what's down here to look at oh my
56:09 - goodness
56:11 - revenge of the left shark okay oh my
56:15 - goodness I'm so excessive all you have a
56:18 - green screen which is a beautiful thing
56:21 - second of all you're wearing a shark
56:23 - suit which is just absolutely fantastic
56:25 - could you tell us your name and a couple
56:28 - second and if you want to remain
56:29 - incognito as the shark that's allowed
56:31 - but and then tell us a bit about your
56:33 - project sure my real name is Caleb
56:36 - Ferguson and my stage name is left shark
56:39 - you may know me from 2015 when I may
56:44 - have messed things up during the Super
56:45 - Bowl a little bit with Katy Perry but I
56:48 - made this project you know thinking
56:51 - about it for three years after the
56:53 - internet was making fun of me for my
56:55 - dance moves I wanted to show them it's
56:57 - not so simple
56:58 - and so I made this game where you can
57:01 - dance with your own fins and see if
57:03 - you're good or not okay so I play it are
57:06 - you playing you play it you're just in
57:08 - you're just the shark I'm just here to
57:10 - program the stuff okay
57:11 - can I give you this microphone to hold
57:13 - if you want to say anything about what's
57:14 - going on you're welcome to sure you need
57:17 - to put on those blue gloves right there
57:21 - those are your fins so if I were a
57:26 - naturally occurring shark no because
57:29 - your fins would already people this was
57:36 - the music that I used to listen to
57:37 - reflecting on the past
57:38 - are you ready there's going to be a
57:40 - short tutorial and then you're in this
57:51 - game uses computer vision and pixel
57:54 - manipulation in order to achieve its
57:57 - goals including some code from Dan
57:59 - shipment himself here we go use your
58:05 - palms
58:10 - [Music]
58:35 - [Music]
58:51 - [Music]
59:30 - I approve fantastic not surprisingly fun
59:36 - I don't think I should be surprised
59:42 - here you go thank you this was a good
59:46 - workout - oh yeah that's your folks all
59:49 - right great job thank you I feel like
59:51 - I've got so much to say about this baby
59:52 - I'm too just in the moment of being a
59:56 - shark and I appreciate the green screen
59:58 - I actually worked surprisingly well the
60:00 - computer vision and I loved the story
60:05 - that the this project has with it as
60:07 - well in terms of a dancey game so great
60:09 - job thank you
60:12 - okay hello there how are you nice to see
60:14 - you alright let's go let's uh let's take
60:17 - a look over here what is this Carly can
60:22 - you show us your projects okay so tell
60:28 - us your name and a few sentences about
60:30 - your project Carly so cool which is
60:39 - expressing myself in two fishes and I'm
60:44 - inviting the audience's go into the fish
60:46 - body and be a part of me and perform to
60:52 - make one fish kind of win so I can go up
60:57 - in there hello I am fish don't look at
61:12 - the other side I am better I need to be
61:18 - in control of my pool
61:19 - I own this body get out of here
61:26 - get out get out get a help language
61:34 - needs to be better language needs to be
61:38 - better get out get out
61:46 - get out I think it wants me to get out I
61:53 - actually designed the last part to be
61:57 - like nothing happening so people get
61:59 - kind of frustrated and a little angry
62:01 - and they kind of keep saying get out it
62:08 - definitely worked on me although I have
62:09 - to admit like part of it was me
62:11 - wondering oh it did stop working is it
62:12 - not detective so I think that's
62:14 - successful but it's always it's
62:15 - interesting about the context of an ITP
62:16 - show where you're always like is the
62:18 - thing broken is it working so that it
62:20 - kind of definitely infiltrates my mind
62:26 - when the audience is doing the speaking
62:30 - inside they're like very focused on just
62:32 - reading the scripts but they never see
62:34 - what is happening outside and they're
62:36 - becoming the performer being watched by
62:38 - others you can only see the collective
62:40 - body and it is like I have this sense
62:43 - being in there performing of that I'm
62:46 - really hidden and then I'm not like the
62:49 - stage fright or the sort of fear or like
62:50 - I just feel very free in there to do
62:53 - whatever I want in my face like and just
62:54 - and the fact that if the lines are
62:56 - prompting me it's a very like
62:57 - comfortable experience weirdly too
62:58 - because using my face exactly okay great
63:04 - let's go see if Artie has returned I
63:07 - don't think are there more projects down
63:10 - here so one two oh there's not that over
63:13 - there come back this way oh yes she's
63:19 - back
63:21 - hello can we talk to you about your
63:23 - project this is live streaming sorry too
63:27 - sorry to just jump in here but this is
63:29 - good because this is like a nice quiet
63:30 - spot it's so like so festive over here
63:33 - now this is from the photography
63:34 - department yes okay which is nicely
63:37 - linked okay so let's try doing this
63:40 - first
63:40 - tell us your name and a few sentences
63:42 - about your project and then we'll try to
63:44 - get some footage of the different
63:45 - cameras the pieces okay neo retro
63:53 - experimental cameras so basically
63:55 - emerges the digital and analog photo
63:58 - experience so you take photos with a
64:00 - digital camera but it immediately
64:02 - applies filters that mimic the quality
64:04 - of a film camera and it mimics the whole
64:06 - experience and there's no screen and all
64:09 - of that
64:10 - fantastic so can you show us some of the
64:12 - cameras or maybe and so we can see what
64:16 - they look like what I'm trying to do is
64:22 - create a business and so this would be
64:23 - like one part of the experience of these
64:27 - are different prototypes and how the
64:29 - cameras would be shelved in or like
64:32 - cased in this is all out of acrylic and
64:35 - so it shows like the colors and the
64:36 - styles that I would want to use and
64:38 - create in the camera one of them
64:39 - actually works it's functional but you
64:43 - know just mostly the prototypes and how
64:44 - it would look and what kind so the
64:48 - cameras mimic a film camera but they
64:51 - aren't actually a film camera so that
64:53 - what's the technology that's inside
64:54 - that's actually taking the image process
64:57 - again it's the Raspberry Pi 0 for the
65:00 - size make it easier to put in a case and
65:04 - then it's me just like exploring with
65:06 - different ways of using Python so it
65:09 - immediately apply filters that mimic it
65:11 - so I'd like studied film filters and
65:13 - then recreated them and then applied
65:15 - them onto the camera the photos that it
65:16 - takes so it's all digital but just like
65:19 - that experience and it's spontaneous you
65:21 - never know what kind of fields you're
65:22 - gonna get you don't know if you're gonna
65:23 - get a lot of light burn or
65:25 - Green and if people want to find out
65:27 - more or you do you have a website about
65:28 - it yet or what can you tell us what the
65:30 - URL is which is OJ oro calm and where
65:35 - does the name come from it's Spanish a
65:37 - ho is Spanish for gold and I translate
65:39 - it to English so it means really that
65:40 - these are essentially tools for you to
65:42 - explore your own artistry Oracle tonight
65:44 - wonderful they're beautiful I'm excited
65:46 - to have one someday
65:48 - great job congratulation sorry okay
65:51 - I wonder if we should we'll probably
65:52 - lose the Wi-Fi but I almost feel like we
65:54 - should go outside and got a cup it's
65:55 - raining but it's waterproof that's an
65:57 - iPhone X yeah let's try it let's be bold
66:02 - what we're gonna attempt to go outside
66:05 - if they're livestream cuts out you'll
66:08 - know why it'll come back it's also
66:09 - raining so if everything if everything
66:12 - falls apart oh my god I shouldn't take
66:14 - this outside
66:15 - alright I'm gonna put this down I'm just
66:17 - gonna put this right here
66:24 - it's okay
66:49 - perfect yeah all right
67:01 - what else
67:03 - oh let's um there's a couple other
67:05 - projects back here yeah hi can we ask
67:14 - you about your project you tell us about
67:15 - it so just tell us were you having a
67:18 - moment yeah tell us your name and a few
67:23 - sentences about your project that will
67:24 - try to get some footage of it clothes
67:26 - for people this is a live stream going
67:27 - on right now it's being an only child
67:38 - under the one-child policy in China and
67:40 - then it got bigger and I started
67:42 - thinking about how power structures and
67:44 - policy affect individuals and identities
67:48 - and their individuality so I decided to
67:50 - create this kinetic sculpture as a
67:52 - response to that and basically it's an
67:56 - artificial erosion of stones wonderful
68:04 - we should go look at the same I'm just
68:06 - curious have you had people come through
68:07 - who have had similar experiences to you
68:09 - and and have they had any interesting
68:11 - reactions or feedback in that sense and
68:22 - it really made them realize like oh wow
68:26 - this affects every person every family
68:29 - and it's not just about population it
68:33 - really affects people on how they grow
68:36 - up and how how their personality or
68:39 - identity are being shaped and also it
68:41 - yes some people really said that wow
68:44 - it's so shocking to make them feel or
68:46 - start thinking about what are things
68:49 - that kind of like shaping them right now
68:51 - yeah I'm here watching your thesis
68:53 - presentation that sort of mirrors my
68:54 - son's a bit like oh there's a lot more
68:56 - to it than just a number I mean I add a
68:59 - sense of course that that's gonna have a
69:01 - social impact but I don't think I had
69:03 - thought through it as deeply or really
69:04 - and you know as in a way that your
69:08 - presentation got me thinking which is
69:09 - great all right so let's try to get some
69:11 - footage of the actual sculpture
69:20 - you get some sound
69:54 - okay let's should we go back upstairs we
69:59 - can probably wrap up soon there's a
70:01 - couple rooms we miss should we try this
70:02 - some more okay we'll keep going I should
70:05 - probably check on my my son is here
70:09 - would stayed home from school sick and I
70:11 - brought him to work with me a where's
70:12 - Ealy's project I need to see that oh I
70:17 - do yes okay we're going back up the
70:19 - stairs again
70:20 - I almost want to check it's just my own
70:48 - neuroses this is why I like live
70:51 - streaming and not separately recording
70:53 - anything as if it's not working people
70:55 - will tell you but this no one can hear
71:02 - okay okay so we're oh yes let's try it
71:14 - ahead there
71:16 - Haley wait one sec oh yeah who she
71:31 - bought it and it's a really playful
71:33 - research about the pushy bottom with
71:35 - different emotions today with the bottle
71:39 - has a different emotion and different
71:40 - tactile feedback
71:54 - and this is the excitement when you
71:57 - present and this is the impatient butter
72:14 - melody to the press so we might say to
72:18 - the patient
72:48 - hi did you say your name at the
72:51 - beginning yeah okay yeah this is I love
72:57 - this project so much can can I actually
72:59 - try playing with some of the buttons
73:13 - timid excited impatient and then you
73:21 - don't have these labels
73:24 - precise but then there is a different
73:26 - tactile feedback so you can try it
73:32 - this one is stubborn happy and this one
73:51 - is stubborn also we can see the
73:54 - underneath that's great let's just try
74:02 - that again just because that's useful
74:03 - explanation so it's really easy to press
74:08 - when I change the value here sorry okay
74:13 - oh my goodness yeah this is good I you
74:19 - know this is good this could be good for
74:21 - like physical therapy I feel wonderful
74:25 - great job okay I'm trying to avoid and
74:30 - fortunately the sound projects let's
74:33 - come over C and C D through okay it tell
74:36 - us your name and a little bit about your
74:37 - project hi my name is Metro and I'm here
74:40 - to show you
74:40 - Kenna Graham skinny grams is a slit
74:42 - based animation technique it's also a
74:44 - photobooth so people have taken pictures
74:46 - over here if you can
74:47 - probably so if you notice actually let
74:50 - me bring this down so this is Mathura
74:52 - one of our residents and you can see her
74:54 - I'm not sure how you see that actually
74:57 - looks nicer on camera interesting but
74:59 - yeah so this is what it is people have
75:01 - been coming in
75:04 - here I'm gonna give you the microphone
75:06 - you keep talking alright so we've got
75:08 - like a mini photo booth set up so Dan's
75:11 - gonna Dan's gonna take a one picture
75:13 - over four seconds so it basically takes
75:14 - four pictures over four seconds just do
75:16 - one motion slowly I'm going to say go
75:19 - ready and go perhaps but but this is
75:26 - what that looks like and I'm gonna so
75:30 - this is what that looks like
75:31 - I'm gonna print that out we can try it
75:33 - again I know you're faster in time but
75:34 - I'm just gonna print that out and you
75:35 - hand this to you you want to try it
75:37 - again we can try it again later yeah I'm
75:39 - going to print out right now let's one
75:49 - week why don't we come look at this or
75:51 - this and then it will come here and then
75:53 - we'll come right back okay
75:54 - tell us your name and a few sentences
75:56 - about your project can I try to play and
76:18 - tap on the screen
76:24 - who can have more score see one minute
76:26 - okay the winner
76:28 - okay sure oh I have to pick it up okay
76:37 - yeah I'm gonna put the microphone down
76:39 - just play
77:09 - [Music]
77:15 - there come over here and see this coin
77:18 - oh no it's gone okay okay
77:51 - I lost yeah
77:54 - excellent work that's really fine your
77:57 - head of course okay let's come can we
77:59 - come look at your guys project okay so
78:02 - tell me your names and a few sentences
78:04 - about what you make and Vidya is nearby
78:11 - there were four of us we're team evil or
78:16 - team primates so we were in a class
78:20 - where you pick an NYU researcher and
78:22 - then you make a public interactive
78:24 - exhibit about their research so ours is
78:26 - based on
78:27 - the NYU primatology labs research saying
78:29 - that primate brain size is linked to
78:32 - diet and not social factors so we came
78:36 - up with a few Interactive's maybe Dan
78:37 - wants to try this one here so which
78:44 - brain requires
78:48 - which brain requires the most energy to
78:51 - power so we built this with the alpha
78:54 - editor the p5 editor and JavaScript nice
79:02 - and then we came up with all this wall
79:06 - text just one question and well is
79:13 - almost done with this game so Dan you
79:15 - should also play this game we don't
79:27 - really need this out
80:01 - finding out which primate you are based
80:03 - on which diet you're best at so
80:06 - currently he's in the running for being
80:07 - a howler monkey
80:15 - [Music]
80:28 - [Music]
80:31 - yeah
80:37 - so I swipe your hands and see if you can
80:39 - get this the hardest level 3-0
81:13 - not the rock
81:24 - let's see which monkey you are
81:35 - [Music]
81:36 - [Laughter]
81:38 - the level of detail you guys had to the
81:40 - interaction design and I like that
81:41 - there's full tutorial off there was
81:43 - really impressive I would say the second
81:45 - one was like confusing to me I didn't
81:47 - follow exactly what was gonna happen
81:48 - what I was supposed to do as much as it
81:50 - was still good but as much as the first
81:52 - in the third were like really clear so
81:54 - wonderful great work yeah okay oh yeah
82:01 - let's see if we have the photo will come
82:02 - to see use our own second okay
82:04 - so we're coming back to see the photo
82:07 - the same photo that you took a while ago
82:09 - I need to line it properly but you kind
82:11 - of see it red yeah so that's what you
82:14 - get fantastic
82:16 - okay yeah I'll come back again thank you
82:19 - okay let's do you want to tell us a bit
82:31 - about your project so tell us your name
82:33 - in just a few sentences about your
82:34 - friends
82:44 - you can give it your interest interior
82:48 - design decisions underneath learn to
82:50 - interest them critics wonderful can you
82:54 - operate it for us and so people who are
83:09 - familiar with the channel and some of
83:11 - the examples might recognize this is
83:12 - based on the color predictor that job
83:15 - reels created when he came to this in
83:17 - ITP
83:19 - and what did what's new about it what's
83:21 - different from obviously besides the
83:23 - visual design is that what what what
83:25 - elements are a bit different from that
83:26 - original example
83:39 - wonderful great job thank you okay
83:44 - oh all right Effie can you tell us about
83:47 - your oh this people also if you're a
83:49 - frequent viewer or a rare viewer of the
83:52 - coding train you might recognize one of
83:54 - the examples in here as well so um tell
83:56 - us your name and a few sentences about
83:57 - your project hi my name is Effie let's
84:03 - call it because I utilized the classic
84:07 - Traveling Salesman problem and a genetic
84:10 - algorithm to solve this finding the
84:12 - shortest route issue and also this is
84:15 - like a practical adaptation of it
84:18 - because I'm actually using it in a
84:20 - real-world problem which is planning a
84:23 - travel route so here you can see I have
84:25 - selected many places and I can actually
84:28 - cancel and move where do you want to go
84:33 - you pick you pick flush so these are all
84:41 - the gardens and parks in New York City
84:43 - we can go to Jamaica Bay and then I go
84:47 - to confirm and you can see the computer
84:50 - kind of just do it instantly oh wow that
84:52 - was very fast how many points with that
84:54 - just now ten points
85:00 - a little bit of animation to take you
85:03 - through all the rounds it's really nice
85:06 - to see like an actual application of a
85:09 - kind of standard classic computer
85:11 - science algorithm problems so it's
85:13 - really great so I assume at some point
85:14 - once you have too many points that sort
85:17 - of it breaks down did you figure out
85:18 - what that sweet spot is during the show
85:27 - with many selections people make I feel
85:31 - like some people will make like 20
85:33 - selections and then it's gonna take
85:36 - longer but eventually it'll still solve
85:38 - it yeah it's doing pretty good
85:45 - so yeah this is great thank you so much
85:49 - great job okay let's come on in here
85:53 - whoa oh my goodness we got a lot of
85:56 - stuff to look at here whoa all right oh
85:59 - my goodness this looks it that looks
86:01 - very intense I want to try that looks
86:06 - like let's see all right
86:10 - Barak and Tom you want to say your name
86:12 - and tell us about your project tell me
86:16 - your name and first just so we have it
86:18 - when it gets edited so I'm Barack and we
86:26 - got inspiration from the prisoner system
86:29 - panopticon and try to create this
86:31 - project that expressed our concern about
86:34 - mass surveillance so do you want to
86:36 - explore it before I explain it I'm sure
86:38 - here I'll give you the microphone and
86:40 - you're gonna you guys can explain it
86:41 - while I've explored
86:46 - please step back just move it let's see
86:50 - but they captured yes and it also
86:56 - mistakes you for Alden yes so Jim loved
87:01 - its bearded people and if the bees come
87:05 - stand with you probably you will see
87:07 - boats every day we have a lot of the
87:10 - beach
87:15 - some of the yes now wearing the same
87:16 - shirt so basically we put a cup of
87:20 - civilian camera outside alone the
87:22 - hallway and when you are checking out
87:25 - someone else project you're actually
87:27 - being captured so this is surveillance
87:30 - footage it live from the floor right now
87:33 - I think so say that again just we get
87:35 - that so I was saying that this is
87:37 - surveillance footage from cameras that
87:38 - we set up all over the floor and it
87:39 - captures faces and when you come in
87:41 - front of the installation it captures
87:43 - your face from the camera on top and
87:44 - indexes you against all of the photos
87:46 - that we found so you only realize you're
87:48 - being surveilled on once you come in
87:49 - face your surveilled image and so this
87:52 - camera at the top that's never showing
87:54 - the image from that camera here no that
87:56 - one is capturing your face and indexing
87:58 - them across all of the images from the
88:00 - floor wow that's really something that
88:04 - it's a great way of really unmasking
88:07 - this idea of surveillance in a way
88:09 - that's unexpected yeah yeah wonderful
88:14 - great job okay yes okay great ivy all
88:20 - right tell us their name and about your
88:22 - project hi my name is ivy and this is
88:24 - actually a group project but my two
88:26 - partners they have their own project
88:28 - here so this project is based on a
88:31 - research paper from neuroscience
88:34 - Department of Hawaii
88:36 - researches about the imbalance of the
88:39 - human brain and so human brain there's
88:41 - two neurons which one the one is
88:43 - excitation and another one is inhibition
88:46 - so when they're not when they're not
88:48 - balanced they're gonna have seizures or
88:51 - depression or 6/8 other sickness so
88:53 - people can clash it play and standing on
88:55 - the spots to find the balance of the
88:57 - brain so the white color is balanced so
89:00 - you can step on one
89:02 - thank you you see what's going on
89:12 - it's kind of like a game of Twister
89:15 - sorry
89:28 - yeah how to balance your ring wonderful
89:32 - this is also from playful communication
89:34 - of series exactly all of our project
89:37 - wonderful great job okay we got a try we
89:41 - got to try this I'm ready so tell us
89:45 - your name even though I know your names
89:47 - and pretend like we don't know each
89:49 - other no I'm just kidding tell us your
89:51 - name and a little bit about your project
89:52 - and we'll get some footage of okay great
89:55 - my name is Sam and this project is
89:58 - called harmony from chaos and basically
90:00 - I have some simple instructions here you
90:02 - just stand at the white line and move
90:03 - your hands around slowly and you control
90:05 - the forces in a particle field some are
90:09 - attracted to your hand and summer
90:10 - Springs connected to your hand and you
90:12 - can just using slow or emotions create
90:14 - some fun visuals cool can I hand you
90:16 - this microphone why and try it you can
90:17 - say anything you want I know I lucked
90:22 - out having some whiteboard area but yeah
90:25 - so basically as Dan moves his hands
90:28 - slowly around I've put origin points on
90:30 - his hands and so he's basically
90:33 - controlling where all of these purple
90:37 - and blue particles want to be and in the
90:38 - light blue and / white ones are
90:41 - connected via Springs to his hands so
90:43 - they move a little bit differently as
90:45 - you can tell
90:57 - yeah perfect dancin natural I can
91:00 - actually really feel like the connection
91:02 - between my hands and the particles it's
91:04 - great it's very intuitive I also like
91:06 - that there's kind of like a slowness to
91:07 - it as opposed to like just this flashy
91:09 - like it's gonna like explode Sparkle
91:11 - explode Sparkle as you move it kind of
91:13 - follows you on this like slow way so it
91:14 - encourages almost like a meditative like
91:16 - yeah almost like Tai Chi might be the
91:26 - shop but basically like it rewards
91:28 - moving slow and sometimes I've had
91:30 - people have been telling me that like
91:31 - they might even do more yoga and Tai Chi
91:32 - they had something to like visually
91:34 - reward them for doing that so yeah it's
91:37 - going to make fun things awesome great
91:38 - job Sam thank you okay let's come around
91:43 - oops all right let's get a shot of this
91:47 - beautiful signage here now y'all and
91:50 - Isabella so maybe I can I can I can I
91:52 - get you guys to tell us about the
91:53 - project and we'll just get some footage
91:55 - of somebody using it after okay so tell
91:58 - me your names and a few sentences about
91:59 - the project
92:02 - and I'm I own the project was made for a
92:07 - class called nothing creating illusions
92:09 - and it's a three minute video
92:12 - installation that uses projection
92:15 - mapping and
92:18 - basically we don't like to reveal too
92:20 - much of what the narrative sort of
92:22 - treats but is three minutes and it's the
92:25 - first person narrative alone astronauts
92:28 - and his last thoughts yeah the the
92:34 - installation itself is quite beautiful
92:36 - and striking it's a great job thank you
92:38 - thank you yeah
92:40 - projection mapping based everything you
92:44 - see is screens yeah all right let's take
92:49 - a closer look
93:11 - and did you write all of the text that's
93:14 - scrolling by yes yes and is there an
93:18 - overall story that has like a beginning
93:20 - middle end or is it kind of more it just
93:22 - loops or goes on forever
93:30 - time lapse let's say the person on the
93:34 - spaceship and nothing we confronted a
93:42 - lot of what an illusion means physically
93:45 - speaking but then also sort of obviously
93:47 - went into that
93:49 - in terms of assessing when an illusion
93:51 - means in the social cultural and
93:52 - political spectrum and so I think that's
93:55 - what our story is trying to get up is on
93:57 - deconstructing a few of the illusions
93:59 - that we have about the environment
94:00 - basically it's very cinematic with the
94:03 - sort of like low home and the immersive
94:05 - quality I feel like I'm looking at
94:06 - almost a movie set or something with
94:08 - really that that that aspect of illusion
94:12 - really really works well with the piece
94:16 - okay yes okay thank you
94:26 - oops yeah yes we care a lot of teachers
94:32 - we do get more alive we're gonna do this
94:33 - live
94:37 - [Music]
94:40 - Oh
94:47 - this must be some ancient phone
94:49 - technology with no camera amazed what is
94:53 - your name okay
95:13 - nice to meet you okay I think we're
95:17 - we're kind of close to we're kind of
95:21 - close to wrapping up I think I'm losing
95:23 - starting to lose steam I don't know
95:24 - about you dahveed let's come see when
95:27 - she oh we got some more over here all
95:29 - right all right we're gonna get a few
95:30 - more then we'll go back to this job we
95:32 - can do this okay can you tell us about
95:35 - your telephone some of your name and
95:37 - about your project hi i'm winching me
95:40 - this is my project maximum Bhaskar it's
95:43 - a to Kate about using creative
95:46 - technology to do street performance and
95:48 - also this is a performance that did two
95:51 - weeks ago at Washington Square Park so
95:54 - generally what I'm at is I'm using
95:56 - programming which is like a web
95:59 - technology and the cred like this socket
96:02 - among all the users like audience in a
96:05 - park and they can connect it to my
96:08 - backpack which in which I can use my
96:11 - MIDI controller to send away shows and
96:14 - sound to their phone to create is like
96:16 - very large soundscape so it's kind of
96:19 - like everybody in this space like start
96:21 - to jam together and that's in this
96:24 - project also I'm making like a jet pack
96:27 - so it's kind of like creating this like
96:29 - a very like a cyberpunk feeling so like
96:33 - a brings some new ideas to the public
96:35 - they'll be amazing wonderful I love
96:37 - street performance I love that you did
96:39 - this in Washington Square Park I can
96:41 - only imagine that strange and crazy
96:43 - reactions you got from people oh yeah
96:44 - there's a moment you can say like a to
96:47 - skate hair borders just I could pass me
96:49 - totally burn me that's like a typical
96:52 - New Yorker I love
96:53 - and also somebody even yelling at me it
96:55 - got you cancer that's like very
96:57 - interesting moments like as a stripper
96:59 - boomer you got a chance to explore the
97:02 - city in a different angle which is like
97:05 - a very very interesting way and I'm
97:07 - happy to pray all this emerging
97:09 - technology and the creative technology
97:11 - to the straight so introduce it to like
97:13 - a massive power that's exciting
97:16 - great work great job okay
97:23 - can you tell us a your name and a couple
97:24 - sentences about your project my name is
97:26 - Hussey and this is actually not my
97:28 - approach filling it with a for a friend
97:30 - his name is Rick one he'll be back
97:32 - but I can tell you all about it so this
97:34 - is Paul mimosa and this is a jewelry
97:36 - that is controlled by so the idea is as
97:41 - the wearer you can choose to show off
97:43 - your chest or not to show off your chest
97:45 - at all so if it's stand out it creates a
97:47 - destruction from the bus and then if you
97:49 - feel conscious you press a button and
97:51 - ideally because I broke it
97:56 - so it's about giving them and the choice
97:57 - to show off for another shows everybody
98:00 - wonderful we got some footage of the
98:02 - controller here can you operate it for
98:06 - us just to show us the controller oh
98:08 - just pret just just yeah just it's just
98:11 - for like later if we added something
98:13 - together I have some footage great thank
98:20 - you
98:21 - okay let's come over can we ask you
98:24 - about oh this is twister uh-oh oh no all
98:27 - right tell us your name and a few
98:29 - sentences about your project we make
98:34 - this for a class called plan for
98:36 - communication for serious research we
98:38 - are working with a researcher
98:39 - specializing on the ecology and climate
98:41 - so the whole idea is human-made climate
98:43 - change it will eventually change our
98:46 - lifestyle so we make this twister to do
98:50 - physical adoptions to our future okay
98:56 - try it yes sir okay
99:01 - [Music]
99:14 - [Music]
99:24 - [Music]
99:34 - [Music]
100:04 - sea level rise itself
100:07 - how do you compute a choose agrees
100:36 - [Music]
100:44 - although future like sorry those are
100:46 - based on the officers who game and so
100:50 - it's like generating the future before
100:52 - you know based on the lifestyle shoes
100:54 - great great job thank you okay I guess
100:59 - we could check out this room here novio
101:02 - can't do VR sorry project let's see oh
101:08 - this seems like I see there's like a
101:11 - Rothko like looking thing here hey
101:26 - so can you tell us your name and a few
101:29 - sentences about your project my name is
101:31 - Jason Young first year I could be
101:33 - student this is the digital Rothko so
101:36 - essentially what I'm trying to do is
101:37 - take painting into the digital age so I
101:40 - see this as a light painting which is
101:42 - using LED on paper to depict the form an
101:44 - image the same way a painter uses oil or
101:47 - acrylic to paints and I try to take all
101:49 - the this was inspired by Mark Rothko one
101:52 - of my favorite aspect painters and I you
101:54 - know I took his inspiration and I'm
101:56 - creating like an image which is the idea
101:59 - is if you can see the changes of the
102:02 - painting that are happening or very like
102:04 - slow because the Rothko's work the kind
102:06 - of an homage to Russell's work which is
102:07 - very meditative and the idea is kind of
102:10 - like like chaos founded by some degree
102:13 - of order and stability you know I wanted
102:15 - to make these paintings so that when you
102:16 - look at it you can look at it for a long
102:17 - time just like you can look into a fire
102:19 - for a long time or you can look at the
102:21 - ocean for a long time which is that it's
102:22 - always changing it's never the same yet
102:24 - you know it's always kind of the same
102:26 - it's kind of like the mix between the
102:27 - two which is I think what Rothko was
102:29 - getting out and is and its work and what
102:30 - I'm trying to do in my my work also
102:32 - wonderful it's beautiful now does it is
102:34 - it for at the moment is it just showing
102:36 - us one pattern of color or does it
102:38 - actually change over time or it's
102:41 - changing it's it's I mean you're not the
102:43 - Stan here for a little while to see it's
102:44 - changing but you if you can look at it
102:45 - if you look at it inside the two squares
102:47 - Lotus subtle changes it's generated by
102:51 - just random function or Arduino and so
102:54 - it's it's going forward it's never the
102:56 - same but this is I'm showing like four
102:59 - different patterns so I think this one's
103:00 - about to end and then you'll see the
103:01 - next pattern but you know the first ones
103:03 - take a very warm one the second one's
103:05 - the cool one and this one see I did this
103:06 - one to illustrate some of the visual
103:09 - laws of abstract expressionism which is
103:11 - like that if you put a blue down there
103:12 - oh there's a now it's gonna be a new one
103:14 - it really pushes back now this is this
103:16 - is a it's a different pattern this one
103:19 - is more about how red and blue interact
103:23 - on the eye especially when you're using
103:25 - because the difference between painting
103:26 - and this is like paintings using
103:28 - reflected light this is using project
103:30 - light and there are certain aspects or
103:31 - projected light
103:32 - it's are very trippy to like the visual
103:36 - system I don't know how to say evidence
103:38 - so it kind of looks like it's floating
103:41 - in air I don't know if you can perceive
103:44 - that great thank you so much John okay
103:50 - yes okay well here you are
103:54 - here you are oh boy but I think I might
103:56 - know what this project is yeah okay so
103:59 - first tell us your name and just a few
104:01 - sentences about the project
104:02 - hi I'm Mohammed I'm this project is
104:06 - called by the way hi mom and dad in Iran
104:08 - what I'm gonna show this to you later
104:09 - but this project is called reactive
104:11 - display which is the idea is like you
104:14 - always look leaning closer to look
104:16 - closer at things so why doesn't that
104:18 - thing help you out so for example when
104:21 - you look at look at this painting from
104:23 - up close and I can see all the better a
104:30 - better example would be like the map
104:31 - chart you know you're in the subway you
104:33 - want to look closer at the map to where
104:35 - you're going you always look close and
104:37 - it's very small but that can't be like
104:39 - okay that's a good union and I can look
104:41 - at Union or like my stuff there's useful
104:44 - I can look at that Wow can I try it
104:48 - or is it calibrated for you yeah there's
104:51 - a lot of people here that still I
104:53 - understand try together okay okay when I
104:57 - bring the other painting that's really
104:58 - cool
105:01 - all right this is you can see much more
105:04 - when you look in so let's go in Lexi you
105:07 - can see everything uh yeah Wow that is
105:10 - immensely satisfying yeah and it's
105:13 - pretty useful it can be used for any
105:15 - life it could be a business charge could
105:17 - be so I'm gonna really develop this put
105:19 - it behind a glass somewhere around to
105:21 - see how people react to it fantastic
105:23 - great job thank you this was my teacher
105:25 - I developed this in his class wonderful
105:30 - okay let's let's keep moving because I
105:35 - think we're going to let's I know let's
105:38 - see this sometimes the room let's go in
105:40 - here and maybe I always think this is
105:41 - the VR room but it's not alright let's
105:44 - come over can we talk to you about your
105:45 - project okay Kenny yes tell us you tell
105:51 - us your name and a few sentences about
105:54 - your project hi I'm Kenny sejuani and
105:57 - this is the Handy it's a soft robotic to
106:00 - help people with neuromuscular disorders
106:02 - regain finger strength to rehabilitation
106:04 - exercises would you like to see how it
106:08 - how it works absolutely like I said this
106:12 - is a glove and so really what happens is
106:17 - that when a person's fingers are Sonique
106:19 - it sort of flops down and once it
106:22 - reaches this stage the muscles don't
106:25 - allow the person to open and close their
106:27 - fingers so this helps with open and
106:31 - close enough fingers and also to teach a
106:33 - person how to do functional things like
106:36 - pick up a sword or get dressed or
106:38 - something like that so usually like the
106:41 - first stage of this would be in the
106:43 - occupational therapists office when the
106:45 - person gets fitted they now put on the
106:47 - glove and so now the finger is in the
106:49 - glove and this helps them move it so it
106:52 - helps them bend and straighten and then
106:55 - pick objects
107:00 - different different things and so I can
107:04 - I see how this could be used in the
107:05 - physical therapy or occupational therapy
107:07 - context is it also something that one
107:09 - would wear in daily life to help with
107:12 - tasker it's more about training and
107:14 - improving the muscular function so I
107:16 - first before rehabilitation because the
107:18 - person has to learn how to use it and in
107:20 - addition while the person is learning
107:22 - how to use it I want to introduce
107:23 - machine learning and I want to introduce
107:26 - gesture control
107:27 - so while the person is training how to
107:29 - use it the glove is also learning more
107:32 - data about what the person needs to do
107:34 - so in like I guess version 2 or 3 the
107:37 - glove will now also know what the person
107:40 - needs and will have the person actuate
107:42 - their fingers in several different ways
107:44 - fantastic I'd love to talk to you about
107:45 - the machine learning aspect of this
107:47 - because it's a really wonderful project
107:48 - could be I'd be interesting to think
107:49 - about what could actually be add to it
107:51 - be useful and what might detract from it
107:53 - and not work some well so and now did
107:55 - you collaborate with occupational
107:57 - therapists while working on this or she
108:02 - was actually the one that guided me to
108:03 - focus on functionality I think of what
108:06 - somebody would need to use this for
108:08 - exercise is great and all but they also
108:10 - need to do things activities of daily
108:12 - living so that's why I some other
108:14 - functions of this right now would be to
108:16 - help a person pick something or like a
108:18 - core course you need to eat or swipe
108:21 - your face question here wonderful great
108:25 - job congratulations it's wonderful work
108:28 - okay let's see what else we can look at
108:32 - in here we got some exciting looking
108:34 - crystals over there do you want to tell
108:37 - us about your project real quick sandy
108:39 - okay tell us your name and a few
108:40 - sentences about
108:42 - [Music]
108:44 - crystallized textile Hannah croft who
108:48 - had been growing textile with
108:51 - embellished crystals
108:53 - she used salt crystals and so I decided
108:55 - to grow them using electrolysis and
108:57 - copper so how it works is that I have a
109:01 - positive and negative terminal and then
109:03 - I'm submerging it an electrolyte
109:05 - solution and then over time so if you
109:14 - look over there you can see the crystals
109:16 - forming their conductive so you can also
109:34 - see over there it's powering a working
109:36 - circuit so it has really interesting
109:41 - applications I think imagine doing this
109:45 - in large scale and having a lot of LEDs
109:49 - sort of lighting up crystal is powered
109:52 - by crystals is this just a slide
109:54 - presentation could you send it to me
109:56 - because if we're I'm I'm in theory
109:58 - attempting to edit together some footage
110:00 - from this and that might be useful for
110:02 - this project and so let's get some
110:05 - footage of the individual pieces too
110:09 - [Music]
110:11 - we could also just have you tab through
110:13 - them as you put the camera on it which
110:14 - might work just as well yeah why don't
110:19 - we do that too you could send them to me
110:20 - but just but just not that quickly just
110:25 - like you know ten seconds on each people
110:27 - are watching this live they'll be Auto
110:42 - what is going on in the chat it's very
110:44 - strange I'm sorry about the mic
110:53 - situation everybody in theory that I
110:55 - thought this was a good solution which
110:57 - is which is sorry that you're now just
111:00 - being here while I'm talking to the chat
111:01 - which is that I'm just recording the
111:03 - audio separately and I'm gonna dump it
111:06 - over later but it's too hard to try to
111:08 - like plug this microphone into the phone
111:09 - live so there will be a video of this
111:11 - afterwards yes
111:12 - sorry Thank You sandy okay all right
111:19 - Lauren you want to tell us about your
111:21 - project real quick I'm losing steam I'm
111:24 - starting about you at the ends of a
111:26 - rushing people through stuff okay okay
111:29 - already and so say your name and just a
111:31 - couple sentence about the project then
111:32 - we'll get some footage of you maybe
111:33 - operating this is an auditory social
111:38 - media platform built for low vision
111:39 - users so just think like auditory
111:41 - Twitter so my professor Gus he kind of
111:44 - complains rightfully so about how
111:45 - Instagram Facebook or really visual
111:47 - platforms and they're not really built
111:48 - for him so I saw that as an opportunity
111:50 - to build something from the ground up
111:51 - just for him it's also optimized for a
111:53 - screen reader as well I Tessa can you
111:55 - kind of show us some of the features as
112:00 - a sighted views user or as a low vision
112:02 - user I'll do it as a sighted user for
112:04 - now it's easier so I am going to record
112:07 - a bite and I want to let my friends and
112:08 - family know about my niece who just won
112:11 - a race yesterday at age six take my name
112:17 - in and then I record a bite
112:21 - Abbey won her first race yesterday
112:23 - because she's very athletic something
112:25 - that I will never have
112:27 - and so that posts to my feed right down
112:31 - here
112:32 - and I can also listen to my friends and
112:34 - family are doing - that's amazing that's
112:37 - wonderful
112:38 - do you imagine that this is something
112:40 - that could be integrated with to make
112:44 - current social media feeds more
112:45 - accessible like if I were tweeting or
112:48 - Instagram any image I could also provide
112:49 - an audio description or is this really
112:51 - meant to be used as a completely
112:52 - separate platform I imagined it as a
112:54 - completely separate platform because I
112:55 - really wanted to have the experience of
112:57 - designing UX from the from the beginning
112:59 - from the get-go
113:00 - but I think that's a really good idea I
113:01 - never thought about it integrating it to
113:02 - other platforms I think that could
113:03 - really be helpful wonderful great job

115:08 - basically building was an outdoor people
115:10 - and a children to make it fun wonderful
115:13 - it's really such a unique and wonderful
115:16 - use of AR technology and I just love how
115:19 - playful it is it's sort of to make the
115:22 - experience of dealing with the sort of
115:23 - medical stuff more pleasurable and
115:27 - friendlier great job okay all right so
115:33 - let's there's one more room we didn't go

120:16 - terms of the environment in the
120:17 - multiplayer aspect it's really wonderful
120:26 - and we're seeing on the screen there
120:28 - what she's seen yeah they're saying
120:30 - we're just seeing and you can see that
120:32 - she's holding a drink because the whole
120:34 - story starts in a bar there she gets a
120:37 - virtual and the physical drink at the
120:39 - same time he plays the HTC vive tracker
120:42 - on the bottom of the glass so in this
120:44 - way they get a real drink as well with

121:33 - tricky it's just a processing sketch
121:35 - which is like repeating the pixels and
