00:01 - hello this might actually end up being a
00:04 - new playlist I'm not entirely sure but
00:07 - this is the first video in what
00:09 - hopefully at some point will be many
00:11 - videos about WebGL in p5 yes so first of
00:16 - all this video this first video I just
00:18 - want to talk about what WebGL is how
00:21 - that relates to p5.js how that relates
00:25 - to maybe other JavaScript libraries like
00:27 - you might have heard of like 3j s and
00:31 - kind of like how do you just get your
00:32 - sketch basic sketch set up to use WebGL
00:35 - okay so first of all where do I go for
00:37 - this I guess I'm just talking what is
00:41 - let me let me go to the whiteboard
00:42 - that's gonna help me organize my
00:43 - thoughts there is something called WebGL
00:48 - WebGL web obviously like the world wide
00:53 - web GL stands for graphics library now
00:57 - this term comes from another term you
00:59 - might have heard called OpenGL and
01:02 - OpenGL is an open graphics library this
01:06 - is a standard this is the library for
01:08 - doing computer graphics that exists
01:10 - across many different languages and
01:14 - environments and contexts one of the key
01:17 - things about OpenGL is the fact that it
01:20 - is hard where accelerated meaning it
01:27 - uses the graphics card the GPU the CPU
01:32 - is the central processing unit I think
01:34 - so the GPU is the graphics processing
01:36 - unit now someday I'm going to come back
01:38 - and talk about the GPU in a totally
01:40 - different context related to like
01:42 - machine learning that's not what I'm
01:44 - talking about right now the GPU is your
01:46 - graphics card that's been heavily
01:48 - engineered and optimized to deal with
01:51 - grids of numbers matrices of numbers
01:54 - pixels images any image is simply just a
02:00 - grid of pixels and OpenGL graphics
02:03 - library is a standard to work with
02:06 - rendering images to your computer screen
02:09 - via the graphics card so
02:13 - you might have used us you might have
02:15 - used p3d mode in processing that is
02:20 - using open jail that's actually a java
02:22 - environment so it uses joggle which is
02:25 - like java OpenGL you might have worked
02:28 - with open frameworks which is a c++ a
02:32 - creative coding library which you can
02:35 - write OpenGL calls directly in open
02:38 - frameworks in C++ etc etc I'm not gonna
02:43 - go down the road of all the different 3d
02:44 - environments and how they make use of
02:46 - OpenGL not WebGL is a standard for doing
02:50 - OpenGL in the browser and there's you
02:54 - can you can write raw WebGL code you
02:57 - could learn WebGL and you can make 3d
03:02 - hardware accelerated graphics things
03:04 - happen in the browser it's very exciting
03:07 - I am NOT going to teach you WebGL in the
03:10 - lower level WebGL on its own
03:13 - oh what a lot of people do if they want
03:15 - to do 3d in the browser well you can do
03:17 - WebGL directly or you could use a
03:19 - library that kind of sits on top of
03:21 - WebGL and wraps things in a friendlier
03:24 - way with a lot of features to like make
03:26 - all the WebGL stuff happen for you
03:27 - probably the most well-known library for
03:29 - doing that is 3j s maybe I could pull up
03:34 - the 3j s website and show you some demos
03:36 - 3j s is amazing it has it's been around
03:40 - for a long time it's at many versions as
03:42 - tons of features in is really robust so
03:44 - if what you watching this video really
03:46 - care about just like I want to make the
03:49 - most 3d stuff ever in the browser you
03:53 - probably want to investigate this
03:54 - library p5 as you know as I maybe you
03:58 - know maybe you don't p5 is a beginner
04:01 - friendly creative coding library for
04:03 - JavaScript mostly focused around 2d
04:07 - drawing but it also has a lot of other
04:09 - features like there's a Dom library for
04:11 - manipulating HTML elements on the page
04:13 - you can get the webcam view there's a
04:15 - sound library for generating music or
04:17 - listening to the microphone um one of
04:20 - the other somewhat newish capabilities
04:22 - of p5.js
04:24 - is a WebGL renderer and kind of coming
04:28 - back from the history of processing one
04:30 - of the ideas the central ideas of
04:32 - processing in the beginning was the what
04:35 - you you could sort of flip a switch you
04:37 - could write all this code it renders in
04:38 - 2d you flip a switch to 3d and that same
04:41 - code works in 3d and you could start to
04:42 - add more stuff whereas working with
04:45 - something like three J s it's really a
04:46 - whole different way of thinking about
04:48 - things because 3d in the end kind of
04:50 - works in quite a different way so p5.js
04:53 - in the same way as processing the sort
04:55 - of goal here is can you write a p5 GS
04:59 - sketch and sort of just convert it into
05:02 - 3d and add some new functionality and
05:04 - that's what I want to look at in this
05:06 - set of videos so how do you enable WebGL
05:10 - in p5 it's actually very simple create
05:15 - canvas is the function where you specify
05:19 - a width and a height for a graphics
05:23 - context that you intend to draw in and
05:26 - by default that graphics context is a 2d
05:30 - html5 canvas if you give this create
05:35 - canvas function a third argument web GL
05:41 - suddenly this context becomes a 3d
05:45 - context and there are new functions that
05:48 - you can call I should make a list of
05:50 - these things things that I want to go
05:51 - over are 3d geometry camera stuff what's
05:58 - the camera ooh
06:00 - texture oh my goodness textures what
06:03 - else a material lights they're all these
06:08 - new in some ways your relinquish a lot
06:10 - of that control when you draw in 2d your
06:13 - you really say like this pixel this
06:15 - exact pixel set that exact pixel this
06:17 - color working in 3d often becomes boring
06:20 - exercise of setting up a scene and
06:22 - placing the camera and adding some
06:24 - lights you're kind of relinquishing some
06:25 - of that pixel by pixel control by
06:28 - getting an engine that can create this
06:30 - illusion of 3d perspective for you so
06:32 - this is what I want to in this video
06:34 - series I want to look at all of these
06:36 - pieces the
06:38 - is the overall picture so let me go back
06:40 - to the computer and I'm gonna see and
06:44 - I've got a chat going to see if there
06:45 - any questions come up but first I want
06:47 - to give credit to where credit's due so
06:49 - lots of people have contributed to p5.js
06:52 - so the Creator p5.js is Lauren McCarthy
06:54 - and many other people have contributed
06:56 - to p5.js the the WebGL library was
07:01 - started by Kevin see you off I believe
07:04 - Karen Peng did a lot of contribute
07:06 - contributions to it as well and most
07:09 - recently this summer to students whoops
07:11 - and went the wrong way
07:13 - Cate Hollenback and stal Jia Grigg both
07:17 - worked on overhauling the 3d rendering
07:19 - mode WebGL my shoe is untied
07:21 - so why you're reading that text right
07:23 - there about the amazing work that Kate
07:25 - and algae that I've tied my shoe so did
07:28 - a ton of work and so I'm just going to
07:30 - quickly click on these links read more
07:35 - from Kate here
07:36 - Staal jia here this is some
07:40 - documentation and whoops and about all
07:44 - the work that they did over the summer
07:46 - and the different features what's still
07:48 - missing from WebGL it is pretty new I'm
07:51 - sure there are bugs but I want to make
07:53 - sure I sort of credit this work and then
07:55 - the other thing I would mention here is
07:57 - this tutorial getting started with WebGL
07:59 - and p5 which is a wiki page is pretty
08:02 - much what I'm going to go through during
08:04 - this tutorial we may find some bugs I
08:06 - did a video on WebGL like probably a
08:08 - year ago which was just kind of like
08:11 - looking at what works what doesn't work
08:12 - so but but the work that Kate installed
08:15 - you did over the summer was tremendous
08:16 - and getting so many features back up and
08:18 - running and working so I'm excited to be
08:20 - a look at that with you ok let's do
08:21 - something really exciting just before
08:23 - this video ends I'm going to go to my
08:26 - code and I'm gonna say create kit wait
08:28 - oops create canvas 400 300 and I'm going
08:32 - to say background 51 and I'm going to
08:36 - say a rectangle 0 0 50 50 and then I'm
08:44 - going to say fill 255 0 150 and now
08:51 - I'm going to go look at this sketch in
08:53 - the browser whoa
08:57 - first ah I want to do let me let me let
08:59 - me remove the reference of the sound
09:01 - library so I'm not using it okay there's
09:03 - the sketch okay all right now now
09:07 - everybody stay with me stick with me I
09:10 - am going to add to my code I'm gonna
09:13 - make this sketch 3d okay not take a deep
09:17 - breath it's all gonna be 3d now it's
09:19 - gonna blow your mind making this 3d now
09:21 - here we go
09:22 - I hit refresh
09:36 - so one thing that's really important to
09:38 - mention I'm being ridiculous here is
09:39 - that so what I'm trying to point out to
09:43 - you here is that the rendering context
09:45 - has changed and suddenly the
09:47 - functionality of p5 has changed as well
09:50 - why do I not see the fill color here
09:53 - well if I haven't thought about some
09:56 - questions around things like materials
09:58 - and lights maybe I can't actually see
10:01 - that color without light being present
10:03 - to sort of illuminate the color why is
10:05 - this at zero zero suddenly in the center
10:08 - well p5 to WebGL mode considers the
10:11 - origin point in the center of the canvas
10:15 - not in the top-left so as I go through
10:17 - this tutorial we look at all these basic
10:19 - pieces and I go through geometry camera
10:23 - texture material lights we're gonna see
10:25 - how things work in 2d versus 3d what
10:28 - works to mix between those two modes
10:30 - what kind of remains exclusive to 2d or
10:32 - 3d ok wonderful see you in the next
10:35 - video maybe maybe it's ok
