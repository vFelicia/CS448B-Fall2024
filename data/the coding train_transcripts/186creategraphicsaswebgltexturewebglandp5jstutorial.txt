00:00 - hello welcome to another WebGL p5.js
00:03 - tutorial in this one I am going to
00:06 - actually don't even have this on my list
00:07 - of stuff but I'm gonna look again at the
00:10 - texture function and previously I looked
00:12 - at how to use an image or a video as a
00:14 - texture in this video I want to look at
00:17 - how to make an off-screen graphics
00:20 - buffer essentially like a 2d canvas that
00:22 - I'm drawing somewhere else how to make
00:24 - that a texture in the 3d world and the
00:26 - way to do that is where the function
00:27 - called create graphics now I should
00:28 - mention I have an another video entirely
00:30 - just about create graphics that'll be
00:32 - linked to in this video's description if
00:33 - you want to go look at that but I'll
00:35 - also explain it in this video so you can
00:36 - just keep watching ok so I'm starting
00:39 - with a very simple WebGL example the
00:40 - only thing for this example is a sort of
00:42 - empty space with a spinning cube and the
00:46 - cube at oops the code is here there is a
00:49 - single directional light there's an
00:51 - ambient light and I'm kind of rotating
00:53 - this box using the box function to make
00:54 - this cube now we know that the texture
00:58 - function works in a previous video as
01:01 - well so I also have here unloading like
01:03 - an image of a kitten so just just to see
01:06 - that texture works let's add texture and
01:08 - then that kitten is that what I called
01:10 - it kitten yes so if I add that we now
01:13 - see the kitten on the side that same
01:16 - kitten on the side of every of h9 the
01:19 - box now one thing will be an interesting
01:20 - exercise is how would you make a
01:22 - different image on each side you're
01:23 - gonna have to make this a custom shape
01:25 - maybe you make it a bunch of planes
01:26 - maybe use begin shape and shape I'll
01:28 - come back to that in another video but
01:30 - right now and we should make the light
01:32 - come from the front actually so I'm
01:34 - gonna have the light come from the front
01:35 - just directly from the front this
01:38 - directional light because I want to be
01:40 - able to see the beautiful bright kittens
01:41 - as they face forward ok so but what I
01:45 - want to do is not have to be an image so
01:48 - a way that I can create create canvas is
01:51 - a function that makes a canvas and I've
01:52 - made a canvas a WebGL 3d rendering
01:55 - canvas but I can also use another
01:57 - function and I'm gonna call it I'm gonna
02:02 - create a very bob it's gonna call it
02:04 - graphics and I'm gonna say graphics
02:07 - equals create graphics and now I'm gonna
02:10 - make a square image to
02:13 - 200 so I'm now making a graphics object
02:17 - that's 200 by 200 and this is something
02:20 - that can be textured to the box so this
02:23 - graphics object it's like a canvas I can
02:26 - texture to the box so let's look now
02:28 - let's refresh now I don't see anything
02:30 - why do I not see anything because when I
02:32 - make a graphics context the first thing
02:36 - it is is just the transparent pixels but
02:39 - I can call any of p5 2d drawing
02:41 - functions on that graphics object so I
02:44 - could say graphics dot background and
02:46 - say background 255 and now we see that
02:52 - is there and you know what I could do I
02:54 - could even say graphics dot background
02:59 - and now this is gonna flicker so a
03:02 - little flickering warning here in
03:03 - advance random color you can see this is
03:06 - now just giving it a random background
03:07 - every frame so whatever I would draw on
03:10 - it so for example I could also do
03:12 - something like graphics the ellipse
03:15 - Mouse X Mouse Y Mouse Y 20 and I could
03:22 - say fill oh no graphics dot fill 255 0
03:28 - 255 now watch what this will do look as
03:31 - I move the mouse around I'm kind of
03:34 - drawing on that graphics object and it's
03:36 - still texture to the each side of the
03:38 - cube now what when would you want to do
03:41 - this number one is just what do you want
03:42 - to do something kind of goofy or
03:43 - interesting uh yeah I'm sure you can
03:45 - think of creative uses of this more than
03:47 - I can but here's a reason why you might
03:49 - actually have to use it at present I
03:52 - don't know that this will always be true
03:53 - but at present the only way to render
03:55 - text in 3d is to actually use that with
03:59 - the text function is to take that place
04:02 - the text on a 2d 2d graphics context and
04:06 - then move down a texture so for example
04:09 - if I wanted to have a message like let
04:14 - love equal I'm gonna make another
04:19 - graphics context graphics equals create
04:23 - I don't love equals create graphics
04:31 - [Music]
04:33 - graphics so my kids used to say instead
04:37 - of breakfast breakfast or breakfast I
04:41 - feel like every time I say graphics I'm
04:42 - saying it wrong we should believe
04:44 - graphic anyway create graphics I don't
04:48 - know I've lost my train of thought
04:49 - haha 300 comma 100 and then I'm going to
04:52 - say love dot fill 255 and I'm going to
05:02 - say loved text-align:center and then I'm
05:08 - gonna say love dot text 100 the word
05:11 - love 150 comma 50 so this now should be
05:17 - an a two-dimensional graphics context
05:21 - that's 300 by 100 that has the word love
05:24 - in it so first just to like see that
05:28 - this is working let me texture it whoops
05:31 - all right what happened what did I do
05:32 - wrong here create oh you know what hold
05:36 - on a sec interesting whoa ok so one
05:42 - thing that just happened there which I
05:43 - wasn't aware of would happen and let's
05:46 - say love dot text size 64 to make it
05:52 - bigger
05:53 - is that so here we go now one thing
05:59 - you'll notice is again the image a
06:03 - texture a graphics thing is transparent
06:05 - by default so I'm actually just seeing
06:06 - those letters on the side but the rest
06:09 - of that cube is transparent if I had
06:12 - said love duck background and I said
06:15 - zero for example this now I don't see
06:19 - that cube as transparent anymore so
06:22 - that's an important thing to notice and
06:25 - I could make it semi-transparent like I
06:26 - could say 255 255 255 comma 100 so now
06:32 - it's like semi-transparent so there's a
06:34 - lot of possible things I can do here ok
06:36 - but there was an important thing I
06:37 - wanted to mention
06:38 - which is that when I made when I made
06:44 - and I wanted this to be more in the
06:46 - center there we go that's more in the
06:49 - center when I made the graphics context
06:53 - not a square like 300 comma 200 it broke
06:57 - so I'm not sure whether this is a bug in
07:01 - the p5 WebGL at present or whether this
07:03 - is just something that you actually
07:05 - really have to be conscientious of but
07:07 - because what I would have expected it to
07:09 - do was take that image and kind of like
07:12 - squish it onto the onto the side of the
07:15 - cube but it's not doing that at present
07:17 - so something I might have to investigate
07:18 - in the future but what I wanted just
07:21 - like what I was actually thinking is
07:23 - what if I let's just take this out for a
07:25 - second what if I just wanted the text to
07:27 - appear and almost look flat the way that
07:29 - I would probably do that would be to say
07:31 - texture love plain 300 comma 200 so a
07:38 - plane is a flat surface with a given
07:41 - width and a height so if the text itself
07:44 - is exactly if the if the off-screen
07:49 - canvas is exactly 300 by 200 if I make
07:51 - the plane 300 by 200 it should map
07:53 - directly so let's take a look at that
07:55 - and that also did not work so what's the
07:59 - issue look at this so it looks like the
08:05 - issue is at present p5 WebGL can only
08:10 - take square textures this is a bit of a
08:14 - problem so to me I feel like this is a
08:17 - bug because I know for a fact that this
08:18 - kitten image was not a perfect square
08:20 - image so there's no reason why p5 can't
08:23 - figure out how to take a non square
08:25 - image and kind of squish it or stretch
08:28 - it onto a non square or a square piece
08:33 - of geometry so but I'm gonna leave that
08:35 - aside maybe sometime by the time you're
08:37 - watching this will be some information
08:38 - in the comments or the video's
08:39 - description about how that's fixed but
08:41 - no matter if all I wanted to do was
08:43 - display text there's no reason why I
08:46 - couldn't just make you know I could for
08:51 - now what I can do
08:52 - is I can make my graphics object and
08:55 - plane and plane object match size I can
08:59 - position the this in the center the way
09:03 - that I want to I can make it have a
09:04 - transparent background and I can say use
09:08 - that as a plane and here we go whoops
09:10 - what have I done so I need to say text
09:13 - align whoa okay hold on I'm missing a
09:16 - couple things text-align:center the
09:19 - creek graphics I wanted it to be 300 by
09:21 - 300 I messed up some stuff
09:24 - oh whoa cuz I changed that this was
09:26 - something I was using previously sorry
09:28 - everybody
09:28 - and now there we go so and by the way if
09:32 - I take this out now I have just text in
09:37 - 3d that appears 2d the reason why I'm
09:39 - showing this to you is because now if I
09:42 - put the rotation back in if I put the
09:45 - lighting back in we can see this is now
09:50 - just appearing like text in 3d which is
09:53 - what I wanted to show you in the first
09:54 - place so here's an exercise for you find
09:58 - some interesting 2d animation generative
10:02 - designs for example you could take this
10:04 - fractal tree design that I do a video
10:07 - about where to witch cook the code is
10:09 - over here I'll link to both of these in
10:10 - the video's description can you make
10:13 - this tree a texture in on a 3d piece of
10:17 - 3d geometry what happens if you texture
10:19 - to a sphere a torus a cube that's a good
10:22 - thing so give that a try and see how
10:24 - that goes
10:24 - thanks for watching
