00:00 - [BELL RINGING]
00:00 - Here we are.
00:01 - I think this really is the last
video in chapter 1 on vectors.
00:06 - I'm going to add one more
detail to this example
00:09 - of the random walker, which
is no longer called a walker.
00:12 - I'm now calling it a mover.
00:15 - And where I last left
off with this example is
00:17 - every time I click
the mouse, the mover
00:20 - picks a new random
velocity that can
00:23 - be seen here in the
constructor p5.vector.random2d.
00:26 - Now, you know that's a
static function because I
00:28 - made a whole video about that.
00:30 - And then that velocity-- every
frame is added to the position.
00:33 - And the mover is drawn as
an ellipse at that position.
00:37 - So I want to add one more
concept to this video.
00:41 - And that is the concept
of acceleration.
00:46 - Acceleration will act as
the building block for all
00:50 - of the examples I'm going
to show you in chapter 2
00:53 - because of Newton's
second law, force
00:56 - equals mass times acceleration.
00:59 - So acceleration plays a key role
in any kind of physics engine
01:04 - or physics simulation.
01:05 - But right now, we're
not going to worry
01:07 - about the physics aspect
of this and just add
01:10 - the idea of acceleration.
01:12 - Our mover object currently
has a position and a velocity.
01:16 - And we've established that
the position is a vector that
01:19 - describes relative to the
origin where that object is
01:23 - in two-dimensional space.
01:26 - The velocity describes how the
position changes over time.
01:29 - So on a frame-by-frame
animation,
01:32 - the position is here.
01:34 - Then the velocity is
added to the position.
01:36 - And its new position is here.
01:38 - And if its velocity
remains constant,
01:40 - it would keep just
moving like this.
01:42 - This velocity would be
applied, applied, applied.
01:45 - However, acceleration can
be described as the change
01:49 - in velocity over time.
01:50 - So if this object, this
mover, were to accelerate,
01:54 - maybe you-- and
the typical way you
01:56 - might think about
that acceleration
01:58 - is it's getting faster.
01:59 - So we could imagine it that way.
02:01 - First, its velocity is this.
02:04 - Then it's like this.
02:05 - Then it's like this.
02:06 - So it's accelerating and
moving larger steps each frame.
02:11 - But acceleration just means
the change in velocity.
02:14 - And remember,
velocity is a vector.
02:17 - So that could mean it's
changing its direction
02:19 - or its magnitude
could be slowing down.
02:21 - That's an acceleration
speeding up, turning.
02:23 - All of those combined together--
that's an acceleration.
02:26 - It's just another vector.
02:28 - And it goes into our--
02:30 - what I'm calling the
motion 101 algorithm.
02:35 - And that motion 101 algorithm
can be found right here
02:37 - in the update function.
02:39 - Add the velocity
to the position--
02:41 - this.position.addvelocity--
and right
02:43 - before that, this.velocity
add this.acceleration.
02:47 - So now there we go.
02:52 - Why isn't it accelerating?
02:55 - It's not accelerating.
02:56 - It's not changing its
magnitude or direction
02:58 - because the acceleration is 0.
03:00 - So let's give it something.
03:02 - Let's also give it
a random vector.
03:07 - Ooh.
03:08 - So now you can see
that it's speeding up.
03:11 - Now, the acceleration
here is constant.
03:13 - And it's almost as if
there's this big fan
03:15 - right in the center
that's just pointing
03:17 - in a direction and blows the
mover off in a direction.
03:20 - You could see that it's--
turns ever so slightly.
03:22 - This is most likely because
whatever velocity it picks
03:25 - is not the same direction
as its acceleration.
03:27 - To demonstrate what's happening
here a bit more clearly,
03:30 - I might do something
like set the magnitude
03:34 - of the acceleration to
something much smaller.
03:37 - So I'm still picking a random
unit vector in some direction,
03:40 - but then setting the
magnitude to 0.01.
03:45 - And you can see now
it's turning around.
03:47 - And I could also go back
to putting the background
03:52 - and setup.
03:53 - That might help us see
the path that it's taking.
03:59 - And we got-- here we
got an acceleration
04:01 - in a different direction
from the initial velocity.
04:04 - I could also reset
the acceleration
04:06 - to something random
every time an update--
04:09 - let me take this
and put it here,
04:11 - take this off, run it again.
04:14 - So this is something resembling
that original random walk.
04:17 - But the acceleration
is cumulative.
04:19 - It's accumulating
into the velocity.
04:21 - So if it's picking it
in the same direction
04:23 - randomly a few
times in a row, it's
04:25 - going to build up enough speed
and fly off in that direction.
04:29 - Now, there is another
useful vector function
04:31 - that I haven't
mentioned to you that's
04:33 - similar to the normalize
function that I could use here.
04:36 - And it's the limit function.
04:38 - What limit does
is take any vector
04:43 - and cap its magnitude
at a certain amount.
04:47 - So if I say limit 5 and this
vector has a magnitude of 15,
04:53 - it will take that vector
and shrink it down,
04:55 - set its magnitude to 5.
04:57 - The difference between
limit and, say,
04:59 - set magnitude or normalize
is if it's less than 5,
05:02 - it's not going to
raise it up to 5.
05:04 - It's going to leave
it at, say, 2.
05:07 - So back in the
code, what I can say
05:09 - is any-- after I apply
the acceleration,
05:12 - let's make sure the velocity
doesn't get too large.
05:15 - And I can say limit.
05:16 - I don't know.
05:16 - I'm just going to
say limit it to 2.
05:18 - So it's a pretty
strict limit there.
05:20 - And then if I run the
sketch, what this-- this
05:23 - is now really looking much more
like that random walk before.
05:26 - But I am using the concepts
of acceleration and velocity.
05:31 - And so now this would allow
me to do a lot more stuff
05:35 - with a random walk.
05:37 - And that's going
to come as I get
05:38 - to more stuff and more and more
of these examples in chapter 2.
05:43 - But ultimately,
what I want to show
05:45 - you here is what
happens when I calculate
05:48 - a very specific acceleration,
like one that points
05:51 - towards the mouse location.
05:53 - Still I might say you could
pause the video here and try
05:56 - all sorts of other algorithms
for calculating acceleration.
05:59 - What if you used Perlin
noise for the acceleration
06:02 - or what if you had
the acceleration based
06:04 - on some vector that's based on
some other type of data that's
06:08 - coming into your system?
06:10 - But for this
particular example, I
06:12 - can return to everything that
I did in the previous video,
06:17 - which is I have the position.
06:19 - I have the mouse.
06:23 - And now I just want to do that
same exact math operation,
06:26 - mouse minus position.
06:28 - Set the magnitude
to something fixed.
06:31 - And apply that as
the acceleration.
06:34 - Let's see what happens.
06:35 - Start by creating a vector
at the mouse location.
06:38 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
06:41 - Then I'm going to
set the acceleration
06:43 - to the result of subtracting
the mouse minus this object's
06:48 - position.
06:50 - Then I'm going to set the
magnitude of that to 0.1.
06:55 - And I'm picking
that arbitrarily.
06:57 - Now, I have a
three-step process.
06:59 - Calculate the acceleration.
07:01 - Apply the acceleration
to the velocity.
07:02 - Limit the velocity.
07:04 - Then apply the
velocity and position.
07:05 - Let's take out the limit
just for right now.
07:08 - Maybe we don't need it.
07:10 - Amazingly, we get
this result that's
07:13 - something like an
elliptical orbit.
07:14 - You would think the object
would just be going straight
07:17 - towards the mouse.
07:18 - So if this is the mouse right
here and this is the object
07:22 - and it's going in
this direction,
07:24 - basically, I'm taking
this and applying it
07:26 - as the acceleration.
07:28 - So if I take this
acceleration vector
07:31 - and apply it to the velocity,
velocity plus acceleration
07:35 - equals the new
velocity, which is this.
07:38 - And then add.
07:39 - So then it's over here.
07:41 - Then this is the
vector I add to it.
07:44 - So we take this velocity
at acceleration.
07:49 - And now this is
the new velocity.
07:51 - See how I'm ending
up in this path?
07:52 - Now, depending on the relative
strength of the acceleration,
07:58 - then I might be sucked
into where I'm--
08:03 - these-- what I'm being attracted
to much more quickly or I
08:06 - might spiral around it.
08:07 - And we can experiment
with that as a variable.
08:11 - So for example, what if
I said instead of 0.1,
08:14 - set magnitude to 5?
08:17 - Well, you can see now it's
really going out of control.
08:19 - So maybe this is where I
want to limit the velocity.
08:25 - And you can see
now I've done that.
08:26 - It can't move very fast.
08:28 - But it's going to--
remember, that acceleration
08:31 - is super strong.
08:32 - It's going to move right to it.
08:34 - And in fact, it's actually
going to stop at it because it--
08:37 - if it gets past it, it's going
to tell it to slow down and go
08:39 - back in the other direction.
08:41 - And maybe I want to limit
this and set this here.
08:44 - There's so many different ways.
08:45 - I don't know what I'm
trying to do here.
08:47 - But you can see I can get very
different kinds of qualities
08:50 - of how this object follows
the mouse based on this model
08:54 - by playing with what
the velocity's limit is
08:56 - and what the strength of
the acceleration is as well.
09:00 - Now, how I actually
calculate the acceleration
09:03 - and how I think about
this particular mover
09:06 - object in a world that a
lot of different things
09:10 - could affect its acceleration--
that's really where I'm going.
09:12 - And that's really
the model of forces.
09:15 - So there's really
this idea of a force.
09:17 - There's this force
that's pulling
09:20 - the object towards the mouse.
09:22 - But what if there
were other forces?
09:23 - What if there's
forces that are coming
09:25 - from the walls of the canvas,
so to speak, the edges?
09:29 - What if there was just this wind
force or gravity or other types
09:33 - of things, friction force?
09:35 - So this is where I'm
going in chapter 2.
09:38 - I am going to calculate a
variety of different force
09:41 - vectors and put them all into
the object's acceleration.
09:45 - Now you have something
you can really
09:46 - play with as an exercise.
09:48 - Can you create a
simulation with an object
09:51 - moving around the canvas
that all of its motion
09:55 - emanates from its acceleration?
09:57 - What are other ways you could
calculate the acceleration
10:00 - to create some type
of dynamic motion?
10:03 - And so this wraps up
this section on vectors.
10:06 - I'm sure I missed so many
things about vectors.
10:08 - And there's many
more math operations
10:11 - with vectors and other things
to think about and consider.
10:13 - And hopefully, I'll
continue to touch
10:15 - on those as I go on and on
to more and more examples.
10:19 - If you make something,
share it with me
10:21 - at thecodingtrain.com
in the comments here.
10:23 - If you have questions,
you can also ask them.
10:25 - You could join the Discord
to ask your questions there.
10:28 - And I will be back in section
2 to talk about Newton's laws
10:31 - of motion and forces.
