00:00 - all the board wah hello and welcome to
00:05 - another Friday afternoon coding train I
00:08 - hope that I am streaming live by freeing
00:12 - that foul it will make me believe that
00:14 - I'm streaming live thanks everyone for
00:16 - tuning in
00:18 - first I just want to say just want to
00:21 - say the last week I had a lot of
00:24 - technical difficulties and I'm really
00:28 - hoping that those technical difficulties
00:29 - will not happen today I just spent about
00:31 - the last 15 minutes why I'm 15 minutes
00:33 - late although 50 minutes late it's not
00:34 - so bad for me to be perfectly honest
00:36 - fiddling with some settings clear enough
00:38 - some hard drive space reconfiguring my
00:41 - streaming settings and right now I am
00:45 - not crashing if it does crash be warned
00:49 - the stream will just stop with no
00:50 - warning and I'll then right into the
00:52 - lack of chat that's going on and this is
00:55 - a great way to start boy and you know
00:58 - what this is even better way to start
01:00 - what is today's apparently I have
01:11 - actually live streamed a hundred times
01:13 - this is the 100 session now there was a
01:16 - point quite a while ago where I had
01:18 - intended to I'm just looking at the chat
01:23 - here I'm looking at the wrong window
01:24 - there was a point where I intended to
01:29 - plan this very elaborate exciting
01:32 - livestream number 100 I also keep
01:41 - meaning to get some new music and sound
01:43 - effects but nonetheless it is still live
01:45 - stream on 100 and we can be happy for
01:47 - that and I did bring something special
01:48 - back for a live stream number 100 I
01:50 - brought the mug back you could get your
01:53 - very own yellow mug at I don't know
01:56 - where Pottery Barn the local farmers
01:59 - mugs ceramic market I don't know where
02:01 - did you find if anybody can find a
02:03 - beautiful yellow mug like this actually
02:05 - it's a slight little chip in the bottom
02:06 - and wouldn't mind getting another one
02:08 - anyway I do actually have coding trade
02:11 - mugs for sale but that's another story
02:13 - so
02:14 - my name is Dan Shipman I appear every
02:16 - Friday with sub exceptions on YouTube I
02:20 - live stream I code stuff I make a lot of
02:24 - mistakes I embarrass myself and then I
02:28 - leave that's basically what happens and
02:31 - you know how I said I code stuff most of
02:34 - the time i procrastinate and then I
02:36 - takes me a long time to get to the
02:38 - coding because I'm afraid but I'm going
02:40 - to summon my courage and all my positive
02:46 - energy and I'm gonna try to get to the
02:48 - coding quickly today so so anyway I did
02:52 - actually I was being silly but I really
02:54 - do would like to do a special kind of
02:55 - like coding train celebration event
02:57 - livestream something at some point I
02:59 - some of you have been following my
03:01 - channel I am fully with aid available to
03:05 - be viewed a set of elbows here I still
03:08 - have a lot of I had a bicycle accident
03:09 - and broke this elbow and I still have a
03:11 - lot of issues with range of motion and
03:13 - weakness and stuff but in terms of
03:15 - coding and speaking to this camera I
03:19 - think I'm in a good good place so I am
03:22 - back there was a point of why I was
03:25 - saying that but that's mostly why I was
03:26 - off for two months trying to kind of
03:28 - have some surgeries and recover and I
03:30 - just so the 100 stream kind of planning
03:34 - got away from me but I'm trying to think
03:36 - there's got to be like a really good
03:37 - number that's like special in some
03:40 - interesting mathematical way like you
03:42 - know 3.14159 or something so maybe for
03:45 - my three thousandth one hundred and
03:47 - forty ninth stream but so some other
03:49 - number that I could do something special
03:51 - for or maybe have some suggestions that
03:54 - sort of thing I'm looking at the chat
03:56 - and that's but I did I I have a couple
04:00 - special things I'm gonna open my I
04:02 - showed this at the end of last week's
04:03 - livestream but very few people can
04:05 - tolerate watching a full two or three
04:07 - hours of be live or in an archive so I
04:10 - am excited last year you might remember
04:12 - when this YouTube channel was called
04:16 - coding Bo I had this wonderful music
04:20 - video trailer for the channel spent a
04:23 - lot of time energy working on with
04:25 - wonderful collaborators well I got the
04:27 - back together again with some different
04:29 - folks and very soon I will be premiering
04:32 - a new coding train theme song and video
04:35 - I'm going to show you a short short four
04:40 - second clip from it right now let me see
04:42 - my little teaser that's a special treat
04:44 - for the live stream some of you are
04:47 - asking in the chat what are you going to
04:50 - do today
04:53 - well besides read random numbers and
04:56 - play lullaby music I intend to do some
04:59 - coding and today's episode is really
05:01 - meant for beginners so one of the things
05:03 - that I do with this channel is I teach
05:05 - out a program here at nothing changed
05:10 - behind me New York University called ITP
05:13 - and I do have some things to plug about
05:15 - some new programs that we're starting
05:17 - here which I'll do in a moment and this
05:19 - semester I teach a course called
05:21 - introduction to computational media last
05:23 - week I talked about a course that I
05:24 - teach about programming with text text
05:25 - analysis and text generation but that is
05:27 - a beginner course for people have never
05:29 - programmed before and this week was the
05:31 - second week of that course and so a
05:32 - bunch of things came up they do not have
05:35 - a video tutorial on transformations
05:38 - meaning the functions in processing in
05:39 - p5 translate rotate push pop scale I use
05:43 - them all the time to Kody challenges and
05:45 - I sometimes sort of explain them but
05:47 - they don't have a standalone video that
05:48 - only explains to those things that's
05:49 - item number one I do not have a video
05:52 - that talks about how to make custom
05:53 - shapes built from your own set of
05:55 - vertices custom polygons vertex curved
05:58 - vertex I think there's this thing called
06:01 - bezzie a and I'd really really I'd say I
06:06 - feel a little like woozy whenever I
06:08 - start to think about Bezier curves and
06:09 - how they actually work but there is also
06:11 - something called busy vertex which maybe
06:12 - I will summon the strength of fortitude
06:15 - to talk about as well so transformations
06:19 - custom shapes a classic computational
06:25 - creative coding assignment is to build a
06:27 - clock this comes from originally from
06:30 - John Maeda who gave this assignment I to
06:34 - his students
06:35 - which whom is notably Golan Levin was it
06:38 - Golan Levin who now teaches at CMU and
06:40 - as a whole webpage about clocks time to
06:43 - show you so I was thinking also doing a
06:44 - clock coding challenge not because I
06:46 - intend to make a creative or beautiful
06:48 - or interesting clock but if I can show
06:49 - you the pieces of making a basic clock
06:51 - then everybody on the internet who feels
06:54 - like it would even could make their own
06:59 - clocks and share them with me and that'd
07:00 - be exciting
07:00 - okay so that's kind of a bit of a plan
07:03 - for today I'm amazed that people from
07:07 - all over the world are watching hello to
07:08 - my anmar that is really wonderful and
07:11 - exciting and thrilling to me in my
07:13 - little room with no windows fluorescent
07:17 - light these cabinets in this room I'm
07:20 - gonna room with no idea what's in them
07:23 - this actually used to be a closet so I
07:25 - said to livestream so this is actually a
07:30 - but there's still some file cabinets of
07:32 - other things in here so I don't know
07:33 - okay um what else do I have to say ah I
07:39 - wanted to talk about something called p5
07:40 - Manager which is a no npm module Oh a
07:44 - 10:00 p.m. but that's what I've been
07:46 - trying to use a little bit because i
07:47 - have this other way of starting a p5
07:48 - project which involves downloading the
07:52 - like thing from the website and then
07:55 - like renaming it and copy pasting it
07:57 - every time they start a new p5 project
07:58 - which is a completely ridiculous should
08:01 - not be doing that alko reminded me that
08:04 - es6 the green paper is visible Simon is
08:08 - telling at the green paper oh yeah you
08:11 - can see look at this this is actually a
08:14 - probably make it more visible like this
08:16 - this is how you know this is weird but I
08:18 - have this extra laptop this is the
08:20 - secret laptop where it's my script is
08:22 - and all the code I want to type is
08:25 - hilarious
08:26 - right it's correct if anybody wants to
08:29 - write a script for me I would gladly
08:30 - read us and I don't know but but I I'm
08:34 - joking but I have gotten me quite I have
08:36 - gotten too I always see you looking at
08:37 - the side that's I know that's where all
08:40 - your code is in advance and you know
08:41 - what so what the zealot I'm doing if I
08:45 - was at it all tried to appear confident
08:47 - or was competent would you do something
08:50 - like that and plan things and script
08:51 - things but that's not me um but in the
08:53 - chat folks are asking about es6 classes
08:56 - well that is on my list so I wasn't
08:58 - going to do that today because I'm kind
09:02 - of those videos are coming because that
09:04 - is a topic for the course this fall it's
09:07 - around week five of the course of word
09:08 - week next week is week three so it's
09:10 - coming up pretty soon
09:11 - pull this up but you guys might be
09:13 - interested in this ICM 2017 Moses
09:18 - github.com slash ITP NYU ICM 2017
09:23 - seventeen so this is the syllabus for
09:25 - the course that I teach in person and
09:29 - [Music]
09:32 - I'm looking at this oh yeah this is
09:34 - actually where I want to look so this is
09:35 - kind of this is kind of the outline and
09:39 - so we've done the first two weeks and I
09:42 - have videos already I I do intend to
09:44 - kind I do need to like refresh some of
09:46 - those videos like introducing because
09:47 - we're quite old and you know I could be
09:49 - talk about new projects and new things
09:51 - and eventually some new hopefully some
09:53 - new editing tools for p5 will be
09:55 - available soon that I can talk about but
09:57 - week five so I've got to really do the
10:00 - es6 classes stuff honestly I really need
10:03 - to do it next week because by the time
10:06 - we're talking about functions people
10:07 - might start looking ahead and looking at
10:09 - things so so that's kind of the plan
10:13 - kept going don't do poly someone asked
10:16 - in the chat
10:17 - the only other language I sort of kind
10:19 - of speak which is French because you
10:23 - know I wish I knew so many more
10:24 - languages here's a skull oh I've got a
10:28 - script now in the chat oh good
10:30 - here's my script four thousand nine
10:34 - hundred eighty-four nine thousand two
10:37 - hundred seventy three
10:38 - [Music]
10:40 - 186 thousand two hundred and nineteen
10:44 - 2057
10:45 - I actually have another script which I
10:49 - wanted to mention has to be the code
10:55 - you know everybody whenever you see the
10:57 - coding train is coming on in like 3:30
10:59 - or three 45 or overtime is your time
11:01 - zone just just allocate like at least a
11:04 - half an hour hour of doing something
11:06 - else and it's pretty good on goodbye
11:08 - that I might be coding JSONP whoo that's
11:11 - it
11:12 - okay so I am if I am looking into and so
11:17 - you guys might be familiar with
11:18 - something called Oh F course Oh F for
11:22 - openFrameworks which is a wonderful C++
11:24 - library and framework for doing creative
11:26 - coding I I was in touch with Zack
11:29 - Lieberman to come and be a guest in
11:31 - August and we were scheduling it but I
11:32 - had so many complications but I still
11:35 - hope to make that happen
11:36 - of course this is great Oh F course for
11:41 - openFrameworks of course but really what
11:43 - do we want to know this is great like
11:45 - the found poetry of Google searches is
11:48 - really quite wonderful I'm sure it
11:49 - things that I type in there could get
11:50 - quite embarrassing but I like that of
11:52 - course I still love you of course but oh
11:54 - of course
11:55 - let me Google with Shanghai maybe we'll
11:57 - go to some website I think this is it so
12:01 - I am collaborating with Oh F course to
12:05 - print transcribe translate with
12:09 - subtitles some of my videos to release
12:11 - them in China and because YouTube is not
12:14 - available in China easily and so I have
12:16 - a script I did I recorded an
12:18 - introduction to those videos I'm tempted
12:20 - to try to do it have you guys evaluate
12:22 - my Mandarin but now I'm too embarrassed
12:25 - so if anybody's really interested in
12:27 - helping with that I don't know if that
12:29 - there's a need for help with that but
12:30 - our has ideas or thoughts Zac Marie is
12:33 - requesting it was playing
12:37 - at the beginning of my life hi you know
12:43 - so bunny bull was moved I don't have
12:49 - full range of motion I think all this
12:51 - like lame jokes and dancing is getting
12:55 - much worse I think I can do about that
12:57 - sorry everybody okay let me talk about
13:04 - two things that I want to mention which
13:08 - I think are important one is date
13:11 - processing gorg processing Community Day
13:13 - processing Community Day for the first
13:15 - time really this is the first time that
13:18 - we are organizing an event for everyone
13:21 - who works with processing to come
13:23 - together and spend a day to celebrate
13:24 - the community and so there will be
13:27 - workshops and discussions about online
13:31 - communities and all sorts of wonderful
13:33 - things it's for all ages I will be doing
13:40 - but it says there the coding trade live
13:45 - on stage I'm gonna like learn to play
13:52 - the guitar you know I don't know um so
13:55 - School of Rock recently which is like
13:57 - you know I love that show great show
13:58 - salty revin Hanson also fantastic this
14:02 - is by the way coding train the show at
14:05 - the programmer person does musical
14:07 - theater reviews cuz really it's very sad
14:09 - that's not that sad actually but if I
14:12 - could sing and dance for real there
14:15 - would be no coding train or just be my
14:17 - must be I don't know what I read but I'd
14:19 - be tempted to do that ok oh I start my
14:26 - processing day
14:26 - okay so processing day one day I was
14:29 - thinking though like code the musical
14:32 - kind of like musical version of Tron
14:34 - where all the code is like singing and
14:36 - dancing there could be something there
14:38 - right think about it think about it just
14:40 - you know think about it there's a
14:42 - musical theater writing program here to
14:43 - School of the Arts I could quit I could
14:45 - go to the program I could learn to write
14:47 - musicals you could happen I could do it
14:49 - don't don't don't
14:51 - don't test me I might do it okay
14:55 - processing day so I really encourage you
14:57 - guys one thing I want to mention that a
14:58 - couple things if you're interested in
15:00 - coming and you have a lightning talk or
15:03 - a demo or something you'd like to
15:04 - present whether you're a beginner an
15:06 - advanced programmer an artist an
15:08 - engineer a dancer this is for everybody
15:12 - from anywhere to apply and present
15:14 - something and that's well and there's
15:19 - more information here so I encourage you
15:20 - to follow processing or tweet me at
15:24 - shipment a you enjoy the founder of the
15:26 - school for part of computation is the
15:28 - main organizer of this event he's
15:30 - wonderful does amazing stuff so you can
15:32 - also be in touch with him okay alright
15:35 - the other thing I want to mention is
15:37 - that we are I forgot to look at this
15:40 - advanced ITP anyway LED you ima so we
15:45 - are starting here at New York University
15:48 - at Tisch School of the Arts a new BFA
15:52 - which stands for something something for
15:59 - something I don't know I don't know
16:01 - about this academic stuff there's
16:02 - degrees and things like that but it's a
16:04 - fun place I'm looking over here because
16:06 - that's where my screen is where I see
16:07 - myself and I just have this like van
16:09 - anything right just stare at myself but
16:10 - I want to talk to you you the little
16:12 - circle in the middle of this Canon
16:13 - camera so interactive media arts is a
16:16 - new undergraduate program which will
16:18 - start for the very first time next year
16:19 - you can find out a lot more about the
16:22 - program on this website we're having
16:24 - open houses that you could come and
16:26 - actually meet people here and ask
16:27 - questions I'll be around and actually
16:31 - some of these are through like the NYU
16:32 - tour stuff so please check it out and if
16:35 - you're interested in learning more about
16:36 - the new undergraduate ima program
16:40 - there's still the Graduate ITP program
16:41 - but this is new and especially if you're
16:43 - in high school or you know a high school
16:45 - or who's thinking about college and
16:46 - wants to kind of get into this kind of
16:48 - stuff this is something to think about
16:51 - okay so there we go I will include links
16:54 - to all this stuff in the whatever I
16:58 - don't know the video description is that
17:00 - what is that what is that what you do I
17:01 - don't even know anymore
17:06 - all right thank you very much for tuning
17:10 - in to the coding train this was great
17:12 - I had a really nice time and I will see
17:14 - you on I don't know let's do some coding
17:16 - oh okay let me just check first let me
17:19 - see if there's any important questions
17:21 - what is by the way I'm senpai bean I see
17:24 - this a lot is this a Korean phrase and
17:27 - excuse me if I'm totally wrong there I
17:28 - somehow I had a sense that maybe it is I
17:30 - see a lot of people refer to me as
17:34 - senpai Sen Pai and I'm wondering what
17:36 - the hell I guess I could look it up
17:39 - alright oh do you guys hear about the
17:43 - Alka one of a dedicated viewer Alka was
17:46 - reminding me today and let me see if I
17:48 - can like that the cassini there's a
17:51 - great data set that I wanted to look at
17:53 - where is this in our slack Channel
17:55 - what channel is that in oh right flat
17:58 - channel so if you're interested you know
18:00 - only if you really feel so inclined
18:02 - you're welcome to support the work that
18:04 - I'm doing at patreon.com slash coding
18:06 - train if you would like to join me it's
18:08 - a crowdfunding site you can join our
18:09 - little slack community to discuss stuff
18:12 - about the channel and into programming
18:13 - questions and that sort of thing you can
18:16 - get your coding trained t-shirts and
18:18 - bugs at coding trades or envy compost
18:21 - those things in in the chat it's a meme
18:25 - so we're so japanese for master teacher
18:27 - okay i apologizes japanese okay I will
18:30 - look into that that's a bowl that it's
18:31 - very nice of you to say if that's indeed
18:35 - where I wanted to find this link I'm
18:38 - looking in the chat here for the the
18:46 - Cassini spaceship dataset okay so I need
18:51 - to go to Saturn JPL nasa.gov galleries
19:00 - galleries raw - images alright so let's
19:04 - take a look at this let's also take a
19:08 - look at Twitter /
19:11 - 13 PT I think yes so this
19:20 - oh so this is so this is what I'm
19:22 - talking about there the Cassini Saturn
19:24 - there's a bunch of interesting data sets
19:26 - let's see if there's it's it's a four
19:28 - o'clock now and I'm gonna be here for a
19:29 - couple hours more let's see if there's
19:31 - time later someone can remind me I would
19:33 - love to like look into this data set see
19:35 - we could download it and do anything
19:36 - with it but I would encourage you those
19:38 - of you were interested it's it's pretty
19:39 - it's a special event today and and kind
19:43 - of like I've been just like looking at
19:45 - these tweets and seeing about the
19:47 - history okay so in jonatha quorum
19:51 - science graphics editor the New York
19:53 - Times appearing here as a Twitter avatar
19:56 - on the coding train somebody could
20:00 - snapshot this and tweeted back okay all
20:09 - right all right now me back to my live
20:13 - chat see I just procrastinate oh no alka
20:17 - don't worry I was not requesting
20:18 - anything of you I was just mentioning
20:19 - how you remind me of the Cassini thing
20:21 - all right so let's put let's let's go
20:24 - let's move forward let's start so what I
20:32 - want to do is I'm going to now last week
20:35 - I was having trouble with the atom
20:37 - editor and oh let's let's do a little
20:40 - warm-up let's do a little warmup
20:43 - and because I want to make a new p5
20:46 - project and this by the way I said today
20:49 - was for beginners which it is but this
20:53 - p5 manager thing is a little bit of an
20:55 - aside that's that's for how to like
20:59 - generate a p5 project if you're not
21:01 - using but actually it's good for
21:04 - beginners too
21:05 - let's let's uh if you I'm Mike sometimes
21:10 - I think I'm just so easy to forget that
21:13 - there's like you're broadcasting good
21:14 - people are watching cuz you're just in a
21:15 - room by yourself but you're just talking
21:16 - anything because I also used to record
21:19 - video tutorials a lot without
21:20 - live-streaming them and so these moments
21:22 - what happened
21:23 - just get tired or like my wit spaced out
21:24 - do something else and I would just like
21:25 - to turn it off and start okay doing life
21:28 - you can't do that okay p5 manager NPM
21:32 - really oughta do something about the
21:34 - climate control in here it's very warm
21:38 - email somebody this close the closet
21:41 - with file cabinets you think I've got
21:43 - something like a very fancy studio here
21:45 - I'm in a closet with filing cabinets
21:48 - okay no windows but some lights and some
21:52 - computers right so I would prefer to go
21:55 - to the github page for this great I can
21:59 - dismiss this alright so what I'm gonna
22:04 - do is I'm gonna start by doing a quick
22:07 - little video tutorial about p5 manager
22:10 - now I want to make sure one thing that
22:11 - I've always feel really concerned about
22:13 - and never know what to do about is when
22:15 - I do a video about something else that
22:17 - somebody has made I suppose it's a nice
22:18 - thing because I'm featuring it and
22:20 - bringing bringing other people I'm
22:23 - showing it to people and people can use
22:25 - it and contribute to it but I also want
22:26 - to make sure it's very clear that I
22:27 - always properly credit and don't sort of
22:30 - by accident take credit for other
22:32 - people's work so what I want to do is
22:34 - just spend a minute here looking into
22:36 - who created okay so this is chinhae oops
22:44 - camera went off in case you were
22:46 - wondering June how you can anybody help
22:53 - me if Bailey Anderson is asking how much
22:56 - does p5 cost p5 is free it's an
22:58 - open-source JavaScript library no cut no
23:01 - cost whatsoever
23:02 - hide your time and sanity that's just
23:04 - about it
23:09 - okay so someone help me if it shouldn't
23:13 - ha how you June how you how did I do
23:16 - about that pronunciation let me know the
23:21 - camera goes off from time to time
23:22 - because it's like I'm it's like anybody
23:25 - watch the TV show loss it's like it's
23:27 - just a thing I have to press the button
23:28 - every 30 minutes or else something bad
23:31 - will happen in the world okay that's why
23:33 - I does it I could
23:34 - probably if I ever took the time to
23:37 - really try but I'm just used to it now
23:40 - you want to press the button every 30
23:42 - minutes it makes me feel good makes me
23:45 - feel okay
23:45 - like I know it's going on I'm pressing
23:47 - the button everything's gonna be fine
23:49 - that's why I press the button Jun how
23:52 - you okay
23:56 - okay the funny thing is I'm seeing in
24:04 - the chat how this is a little cringy so
24:05 - it definitely is cringy Fotolia a little
24:08 - cringy I think I'm doing pretty well
24:09 - today to be perfectly honest cuz he
24:11 - leaves a lot Grinchy but I like that
24:13 - that the comment went said it's a little
24:14 - crazy maybe his first live stream today
24:20 - is life super 100 by the way okay let's
24:23 - go
24:24 - so I'm gonna open up terminal and I'm
24:29 - gonna just make sure I have node
24:30 - installed great what's the thing that I
24:35 - do till I clear it option command option
24:38 - command shift option there's a thing we
24:40 - like it like automatically does clear
24:41 - for you I can't remember what it is
24:44 - alright then I need to find your window
24:46 - that's not a finder window then I can
24:50 - quit this Cisco Connect thing I can just
24:58 - loop this over and over again
25:03 - simply hurts slightly in the elbow okay
25:07 - and I should read a hundred what I'll do
25:15 - today is I'll read 100 random numbers
25:18 - towards the end I will read 100 random
25:20 - numbers from the coding train is brought
25:23 - to you by a million random digits with
25:26 - 100,000 normal deviates from the RAND
25:29 - Corporation
25:30 - it'll be storybook time later I will
25:32 - read you I will read you from there okay
25:37 - so I have this I have people I'm manager
25:42 - and here we go and I have note all right
25:54 - are the birds creepy I love this is my
25:57 - new favorite sure it was $10 this shirt
25:59 - I feel like I need to have more colorful
26:02 - lively shirts okay hello welcome to a
26:10 - video tutorial about something related
26:12 - to p5 called p5 manager now p5 manager
26:16 - is by chin how you thank you for making
26:20 - this wonderful tool I hope that it's
26:21 - okay that I'm making a video about it I
26:23 - am NOT an expert I did not I can take no
26:25 - credit whatsoever for this wonderful
26:27 - thing called p5 manager but I knew about
26:29 - it and I can use it in class the other
26:30 - day and it really helped me out so I
26:32 - wanted to make a video so other people
26:33 - would learn about it so okay so what is
26:37 - P 5 minute or you guys might be aware
26:39 - that what the things that I do it's a
26:41 - really bad habit sometimes I don't want
26:43 - to make a new sketch I go to p5.js or
26:46 - get some great technique here then I go
26:47 - to download' then I'm like oh which like
26:50 - download oh ok I'm gonna download p5 yes
26:53 - complete and I click on that download
26:55 - something and then I find it you can see
26:57 - look at me this is how ridiculously
26:59 - horrible I am you could see that I have
27:01 - done this is like big 9 times but I've
27:03 - done that the same thing I just download
27:05 - it and then I like open it up and then I
27:08 - find somewhere in here like oh there's
27:10 - like empty example and I rename it or
27:12 - copy it somewhere and that's like my new
27:13 - sketches i'ma do this is not a great
27:15 - workflow p5 manager is a command-line
27:19 - tool that you can execute from the
27:21 - command line what's the command line you
27:22 - know have you since some videos you
27:24 - might it uses it's built on top of
27:26 - something called node and I have another
27:27 - video that I'll link to about what is
27:29 - know but you don't really need to know
27:30 - what node is you do need to install node
27:33 - to use this so you can go to node.js org
27:36 - install node and then you can use this
27:39 - node comes with something called
27:41 - NPM which is stands for node package
27:44 - manager which is a way to manage the
27:46 - packages you want to use with node and
27:48 - but why is this relevant because p5
27:51 - manager is a node package now node is a
27:56 - server-side programming framework in
27:57 - JavaScript and there's a lot that we
27:59 - could say about things that you could do
28:00 - with it but we're not really doing
28:01 - anything with node whatsoever we're just
28:03 - lucky to bask in the glory and somebody
28:05 - else bothered to make something with
28:07 - node called p5 manager so if I've
28:08 - installed node the next thing I can do
28:11 - is go here and I can run this command so
28:14 - what I want to say is NPM node package
28:17 - manager install I wouldn't install
28:19 - something - G - G is in a kind of an
28:22 - important detail but not so important
28:23 - for us right now it means I want to
28:25 - install this globally meaning it's not
28:27 - part of an individual project it's this
28:29 - thing that I just want to use always on
28:30 - my computer from now on p5 manager is my
28:34 - thing now so I can take this and I can
28:39 - say copy it and I can then go to here
28:42 - and I'm gonna just paste it in I could
28:44 - have just typed it might give me an
28:46 - error it might give me an error this
28:48 - might happened to you we're in a hope
28:50 - this error doesn't happen but it might
28:51 - happen in fact it'd be good if it
28:52 - happens because if it happens then
28:53 - you'll see it happen and you're know how
28:54 - to fix it
29:01 - oh yeah let me got the air alright so
29:11 - what is the air now the air is
29:13 - permission denied and this is actually
29:15 - has to do with the fact that we we want
29:17 - to install it globally the if we just
29:20 - all go believe means it has to go in the
29:22 - like depths of your computer where only
29:24 - the administrator whoever that is maybe
29:27 - you can like you've got to like get into
29:31 - the guts of the system files and all
29:32 - sorts of fancy places that you have to
29:34 - have permission for so there's a way to
29:38 - get permission to do that and the way to
29:41 - do that with terminal is by saying a
29:43 - sudo which stands for Super User do
29:46 - Super User do NPM - G no no I don't know
29:51 - I know I'm at the order this really
29:52 - matters install - G was soon back out p5
29:56 - - manager and now oh it asks for my
29:59 - password and good thing I think I know
30:02 - think I know the password rainbow
30:07 - unicorn something like that okay nope
30:16 - nope oh my god really the thing is that
30:23 - you oh this is bad this is very bad I
30:32 - don't know what to do anymore we're
30:38 - gonna miss places poor Matt he was gonna
30:41 - edit this it's gonna here's the thing my
30:45 - keyboard doesn't really work so I never
30:47 - know whether I forgot the password or
30:49 - just didn't like type in the right
30:50 - letters because like the e there's an e
30:52 - in my password this password it's not
30:53 - actually my password its password for
30:55 - this computer the e key only works about
30:58 - 50 percent so what is
31:07 - yeah I just okay yeah let's just pretend
31:13 - I mean it's good to have the like goofy
31:18 - weird I make the mistake stuff but maybe
31:21 - we should just edit this later when I
31:23 - actually posted as a separate video just
31:25 - pretend that addressing this for the
31:27 - first time oh whoa no I'd already shoot
31:37 - how do I get back to it ask you for my
31:40 - password let's quit terminal me if I
31:42 - start a new session oh now that windows
31:46 - gonna be a different size and in a
31:47 - different place it's not gonna match
31:49 - where's my continuity manager oh my god
31:55 - alright ah this is fine we're gonna
31:57 - there's gonna be an edit point where I'm
32:00 - gonna come back and say I figured out
32:03 - what my password it is I'm doing it
32:04 - again wait what is good it's only
32:15 - getting warmer and warmer in here as the
32:17 - sweat drips from down from the side of
32:19 - my face sorry about that
32:26 - hopefully you're watching this and I'm
32:27 - now just reappeared and I figured out
32:29 - the password and entered it so I'm gonna
32:31 - run the sudo command for he would Ken
32:33 - with the correct password so you could
32:34 - watch
32:54 - okay hey that seemed to have worked so
32:58 - now I have installed forevermore the p5
33:03 - manager with note so there are a bunch
33:06 - of things you can do with the p5 manager
33:09 - and I encourage you maybe I'll come back
33:12 - to these if it's interesting hard but I
33:14 - want to show you like these kind of like
33:15 - the simplest way ever use it so the p5
33:17 - manager will actually allow you to
33:18 - create the collection of sketches and
33:20 - you can you can serve them up and run us
33:23 - and like makes it like to like web page
33:26 - with a like a table of contents of all
33:28 - the things you've made but and you
33:30 - should you could follow these
33:31 - instructions for that but I'm actually
33:33 - going to scroll down and what I want to
33:36 - do is just generate a standalone project
33:39 - so I for me in making examples and I put
33:42 - them in all different places it's less
33:44 - about a collection right now and then
33:45 - individual like standalone projects so I
33:47 - want to do this anytime I write now that
33:50 - I've installed that package I can just
33:52 - write p5 anytime in my terminal window
33:55 - now and it's gonna say look hey you've
33:58 - installed the p5 manager zero point
33:59 - three point two so but whenever I want
34:02 - to run up a specific p5 command like p5
34:06 - generate that's going to generate a
34:08 - project and then I have to give it some
34:10 - specific parameters arguments of what
34:12 - kind of project I want to generate so
34:14 - what I want to do is I want to generate
34:16 - a bundle with a particular name and for
34:18 - short you can also just type p5 G - B
34:21 - but I'm going to be long-winded about it
34:23 - for the purpose of this video tutorial -
34:25 - - bundle and the coding train will be
34:31 - the name of my project and I'm going to
34:33 - hit enter it created a whole bunch of
34:37 - stuff I am now going I don't know where
34:39 - I was I'm gonna I'm gonna open it up and
34:43 - Here I am
34:45 - so one thing by
34:56 - this is a boots there is a boot in this
34:59 - room why is there a boot in this room so
35:11 - I want to kind of go back fake some
35:14 - stuff so hold on p5 we're gonna make
35:24 - this look exactly like what it was
35:26 - before oh it already exists oh sure okay
35:33 - hold on we're gonna CD I forgot to like
35:35 - go somewhere like into the documents
35:38 - which I should have done at the
35:39 - beginning how am I gonna fix this how am
35:44 - I gonna fix this I guess I could just I
35:50 - guess I could just talk to it I'm gonna
35:57 - get through the coding is for its funny
35:58 - this is taking way too much time okay
36:05 - it's fine I'm gonna live with what I did
36:09 - I just I didn't want to put it just in
36:15 - you know so I'm gonna the root directory
36:20 - of the computer but let me just get back
36:21 - to where I was and then I'll keep going
36:24 - except I can never get back to where I
36:26 - was
36:30 - and we erase it coding training Oh I
36:34 - mean documents now Oh Mac computers are
36:40 - so ridiculous sometimes okay so now that
36:57 - that's worked I realized I kind of did
36:59 - something pretty terrible which is when
37:00 - you first open at least on the Mac your
37:02 - terminal window it just plops you right
37:05 - into the root directory of your computer
37:07 - and that's probably not where I want to
37:09 - put my coding train project so you know
37:12 - this is a bit of an aside but I can you
37:15 - can change directories I could say like
37:16 - seedy documents because really what I
37:18 - want to do is be in the Documents folder
37:20 - perhaps and then I can kind of go to the
37:24 - Documents folder and I can say make a
37:26 - folder and I can call it p5 projects and
37:30 - then I can
37:33 - oops and I can make a folder and I can
37:50 - make a folder called something like p5
37:52 - projects which already exists there and
37:54 - I could say CVP 5 projects and then now
37:57 - what I want to do is go back and run
37:59 - this one more time to get it right I'm
38:03 - gonna run that one more time you can see
38:04 - it created those projects I can go back
38:06 - to the finder I can go into p5 projects
38:09 - and I can see look at what I've got I
38:10 - have now have a folder called coding
38:13 - train which really is just one project
38:15 - it's got the HTML file it's got the
38:17 - sketch J's file it's got that whoops
38:18 - which I just opened up by accident and
38:21 - it's got the the libraries folder with
38:23 - the p5 libraries so this is the way to
38:25 - create an individual single p5 project I
38:29 - can do this all the time now I'm gonna
38:30 - do it in one of my future videos I can
38:33 - edit and work on it that way and it will
38:36 - always get the most current version to
38:38 - the p5 library and I encourage you to
38:40 - explore also the collection
38:43 - the collection functionality of this as
38:48 - well which you can make a nice little
38:50 - like what page it does it's
38:52 - automatically with all your project okay
38:53 - so thank you for watching video cut the
38:55 - p5 manager hopefully it's useful to you
38:57 - I will see you in a future video
38:59 - more you might see me using the p5
39:01 - manager thank you very much all right
39:05 - [Music]
39:06 - all right everybody sorry about that
39:09 - that can get edited into something I
39:11 - think all right so now what we're gonna
39:17 - do we're gonna start doing some actual
39:19 - coding here now what I want to see is
39:22 - like Adam I like to use the Adam editor
39:24 - it's what I'm kind of used to I have a
39:26 - bunch of configuration settings set up
39:29 - let's go and get let's let's actually
39:33 - get that project folder I just made with
39:38 - the p5 manager which was in p5 projects
39:42 - coding train I'm gonna put that onto the
39:44 - desktop that's where I like to keep
39:46 - everything no I'm gonna rename it to
39:50 - transformations and I'm gonna put it on
39:54 - the desktop and then I'm going to open
39:57 - this with the atom editor looking down
40:03 - at the screen instead of at you hello
40:04 - and I'm gonna open up the sketch I am
40:12 - going to I'm going to get myself to the
40:16 - desktop wants to update something and
40:25 - then I'm going to run a server oh this
40:31 - Mac is not plugged in can you guys see
40:33 - that we've got a problem here I need a
40:36 - power need some power
40:47 - okay that should hopefully do the trick
40:53 - all right there we go that should
40:59 - hopefully fix the problem here at 4%
41:01 - hopefully this is gonna go okay so
41:04 - that's there now then I just need to get
41:07 - back into the browser go to localhost
41:11 - open up the console let's add just to
41:17 - make sure things are work oh yeah why
41:18 - what do you guys think this is about
41:20 - this happened to me last week my atom
41:24 - completely flips out on this computer I
41:26 - just was thought like God happened last
41:29 - week let's take a ride it's only if I
41:31 - log in in this account that I use you're
41:34 - right that this is quite visible more so
41:36 - than usual do you have an idea of how to
41:41 - fix that you're gonna have to bear with
41:46 - me here for a second
41:58 - that's better just change the threshold
42:02 - okay okay I don't know if you can see
42:04 - that all right okay now I guess I will I
42:12 - will go back to using I just spend so
42:16 - much time let's try updating some stuff
42:25 - we try updating Adam beautify and oh and
42:31 - you know what I don't obviously do and
42:34 - let me try oh no I don't you know what
42:35 - I'm realizing also is I don't have the
42:41 - things tend to work much better here if
42:44 - I'm actually not connected to the
42:45 - wireless internet but rather the the
42:49 - actual wired internet so I'm connecting
42:51 - to that now I'm gonna turn off the Wi-Fi
42:58 - yeah I can just use Visual Studio I
43:00 - don't know why I'm stuck on this I
43:09 - [Music]
43:12 - advise you to reinstall Adam all right
43:15 - let's do that let's try that I just
43:22 - didn't want to do that and lose all my
43:23 - settings and everything but let's try
43:34 - let's quit Adam
43:41 - we're waiting for Adam to install to
43:44 - download vim I wish I aspire to be a VIN
43:55 - user oh look at this I mean the
44:05 - threshold - let's split the difference
44:11 - here Euler telling me that atoms
44:40 - beautify was probably the issue and I
44:41 - should have waited
44:43 - I kind of do some tutorials about making
45:26 - electron apps at some point - what's
45:30 - going on everyone s getting questions
45:32 - [Music]
45:36 - yes I want to open it this computer is
45:40 - like dying did I lose all my settings
45:54 - you got lost on my settings right now
46:03 - [Music]
46:08 - no I didn't okay great I think we're
46:10 - back
46:16 - all right
46:17 - [Music]
46:30 - [Music]
46:43 - primary people protective about the
46:45 - setting okay stop the music please
46:49 - your wish is my command
46:53 - alright yeah so by the way people are
46:57 - asking like my computer is at 4% and I
47:00 - plug the plug back in and now it's at
47:01 - like 40% now it's at like 33% the
47:04 - battery of my computer is completely
47:05 - does not work so I'm surprised that it
47:08 - didn't actually just like shut off
47:09 - automatically I need that new laptop
47:11 - okay we are now going to make use of the
47:19 - whiteboard we'll definitely need to make
47:23 - use of the whiteboard for so I guess one
47:31 - thing I'm curious about is how is this
47:33 - picture seem okay brightness level can
47:35 - you see me can you hear me fine in this
47:37 - shot and what's the focus
47:52 - okay stop drawing the little thing how
47:54 - does the focus look I'm gonna walk over
47:55 - here looks like that looks okay you can
47:57 - see that read that okay good okay let's
47:59 - check this eraser okay and oh right
48:14 - there's this great explanation I need to
48:17 - you need focus not the cam I don't know
48:20 - what that means
48:21 - so actually Simon in the chat loyal
48:26 - viewer makes a good point which is that
48:28 - I need graph paper which isn't exactly
48:30 - what I need now I have seen a
48:33 - demonstration of explaining rotation
48:36 - done that makes use of paper I'm gonna
48:41 - put over here and a pen or pencil so I'm
48:44 - gonna attempt to do that but I'm not
48:48 - gonna do it right now so I'm gonna leave
48:52 - this here and I'm gonna go to the p5.js
48:56 - reference page and I'm gonna look at
49:04 - where is the where are the
49:05 - transformations that's a good translate
49:08 - transform okay and that off
49:15 - okay I don't love the only functions
49:21 - that I want to talk about a rotate oh
49:23 - boy translate and scale and push and pop
49:26 - aren't even on this list so I'm not
49:27 - gonna this is not a great reference for
49:30 - me right now because they're part of
49:33 - structure which makes sense
49:34 - so I'm actually not gonna it's fine to
49:36 - have the reference here but let's just
49:40 - keep the whole page here alright here we
49:44 - go everybody 50 minutes hit hey you know
49:49 - Phoenix makes a good point that it is 50
49:51 - minutes in and I haven't really done any
49:52 - coding yet but at least you know I
49:54 - talked about p5 manager with something
49:57 - it's better than nothing all right
50:08 - let's begin hello everybody in this
50:17 - video tutorial I'm starting here by this
50:19 - whiteboard my friend the whiteboard ID
50:22 - to get my district people of the room XD
50:23 - ok it's fine it's fine hopefully no
50:25 - one's gonna come to complain I want to
50:27 - talk about transformations so this is
50:30 - actually a video tutorial that I've been
50:31 - missing for a long time it fits right
50:33 - into the first or second week of
50:34 - programming really because it really it
50:37 - can become a very sophisticated complex
50:39 - topic as we move into 3d graphics and
50:41 - all sorts of stuff but ultimately this
50:44 - is a way of controlling your views so to
50:48 - speak of the canvas you're drawing to
50:51 - the orientation the scale the rotation
50:55 - to alter the way that you draw things so
50:57 - that's a terrible way to explain it so
50:59 - let me make a list first this is gonna
51:02 - help the functions that I want to
51:05 - explore in this video are translate
51:09 - rotate there's another one scale and
51:17 - then also push and pop now there are
51:23 - more functions related to
51:24 - transformations than just these three
51:26 - and they push these five really but
51:29 - these are the ones I don't want to focus
51:30 - on in this video and I want to talk
51:31 - about what's the goal what is the goal
51:32 - here so there's a lot of reasons why you
51:34 - might want to use transformations and
51:36 - I'll try to talk about those grouping
51:37 - shapes together can be useful nesting
51:40 - various shapes within each other is a
51:42 - way that it could be useful but
51:43 - ultimately for you who are if you're
51:46 - just starting working with code and p5
51:48 - and graphics the main reason you want to
51:50 - use transformations it's really just for
51:52 - this rotate function because you have a
51:55 - canvas you might have a rectangle here
52:00 - and what you want is for that rectangle
52:01 - to spin around and rotate like rotate to
52:05 - spin around and you would think that's
52:07 - like the simplest thing because there's
52:09 - a rotate function in turn I just say
52:10 - rotate another thing rotates and we're
52:11 - done we can leave it's not and it
52:13 - ultimately it's it's it's um it's not so
52:16 - hard but
52:17 - a little tricky at first and a little
52:18 - confusing what these things do so the
52:20 - goal that I want to have in this video
52:22 - and there's more to it than this but at
52:23 - least for this first video about
52:24 - transformations is I want to have two
52:26 - rectangles and I want them each to
52:30 - rotate maybe this one rotates around its
52:32 - center now maybe this one rotates around
52:35 - its corner and they both rotate in
52:37 - opposite directions independently of
52:39 - each other and then you might think to
52:41 - yourself also like an exercise you can
52:43 - do and maybe I'll I think I did this
52:45 - actually in some solar system simulation
52:47 - video that from remembering that right
52:49 - now is you could think about well what
52:51 - if you have some type of solar system
52:53 - like simulation where you have some type
52:55 - of star or Sun in the middle a planet
52:57 - that rotates around that and while that
52:59 - planet rotates around that there's
53:01 - another one you know kind of rotating
53:03 - around that so think about these sort of
53:04 - nested systems and I'm sure you'll come
53:06 - up with all sorts of other creative
53:07 - ideas so where to begin I first want to
53:13 - begin with the translate function so I'm
53:15 - going to come over here and I'm gonna go
53:18 - to some code which has very little in it
53:19 - and I'm gonna just do I'm gonna write a
53:22 - draw function ultimately I'm gonna start
53:24 - with something static but ultimately I
53:28 - might have an animator so so I'm gonna
53:32 - draw a rectangle and I'm gonna draw that
53:33 - rectangle at you know 50 comma 50 and
53:37 - I'm going to be 100 pixels wide and 50
53:39 - pixels high and I'm gonna say fill 255
53:41 - and I'm gonna go back to the browser and
53:43 - I'm gonna look at this rectangle so I
53:45 - see this rectangle there there it is so
53:48 - what have I done I have drawn let's come
53:57 - back to this here
54:02 - Matt maybe you can edit out that erasing
54:05 - there and just have a little jump cut
54:12 - could we just because I forgot how like
54:14 - to Harbor racing is for me right now so
54:15 - I do with my left hand and so like can't
54:21 - really do it quickly like I usually late
54:23 - in the video okay I'm gonna draw the
54:30 - canvas again and what I've done right I
54:34 - have this rectangle and I gave it an XY
54:37 - position and it's oriented according to
54:39 - its corner its position is 50 comma 50
54:43 - 50 pixels alone on the x-axis 50 pixels
54:46 - on the y-axis and it's we see it here
54:48 - because it's 50 comma 50 relative to 0-0
54:53 - which is in the top left
54:54 - so we're saying rectangle 50 comma 50
54:59 - you know 100 comma 50 now I could do
55:03 - exactly the same code exactly the same
55:07 - code in a slightly different way I could
55:12 - say instead translate 50 comma 50 and
55:20 - then I could say rectangle zero comma
55:24 - zero 100 comma 50 and what I've done is
55:29 - I this is these two pieces of code are
55:32 - identical because what does translate do
55:34 - it moves the point of origin
55:37 - it moves 0 0 and says 0 0 now lives here
55:45 - so if I draw the rectangle at 0 0 I see
55:48 - it in exactly the same place but I'm
55:50 - just thinking about the orientation of
55:53 - the canvas in a different way and the
55:55 - reason why you might do this is to say
55:56 - oh translate this 0 0 to the center
55:59 - because you just feel you like to like
56:00 - think about your screen and it's like 0
56:03 - 0 being in the center there's all sorts
56:04 - of reasons why you might do this let's
56:07 - prove that this is the case though I'm
56:12 - back here so I'm now going to say right
56:15 - here
56:16 - translate 50/50 rectangle 0 0 100 comma
56:22 - 50 and I'm gonna say fill well actually
56:27 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
56:28 - comment this out and I'm gonna hit
56:30 - refresh we should see exactly the same
56:32 - code the second the same result exactly
56:36 - the same result
56:40 - timeout for a second yeah sorry I saw
56:45 - something in the chat order Ford of
56:46 - transformations matter yeah all this
56:48 - stuff is going to be relevant okay I
56:50 - feel like I might be taking too long to
56:53 - get to the important parts here but here
56:55 - we go
57:02 - so this is exactly the same why why
57:07 - would I do it one way for the other why
57:09 - would I write it this way Arai why would
57:11 - I write it this way and to be honest
57:12 - there's no real answer to that question
57:13 - it's sort of personal style personal
57:15 - preference but there are scenarios where
57:18 - translating the origin as you and we
57:26 - started for X again I'm having this
57:28 - problem again mostly because I feel like
57:29 - this marker is no good
57:31 - and I and I can't tolerate it Australia
57:33 - for market so why would you do one or
57:38 - the other why would you say translate
57:40 - 5050 and then draw the rectangle at zero
57:43 - zero versus just drawing the rectangle
57:44 - directly at 5050 well one of the things
57:47 - that's important here is that these
57:48 - translations accumulate so just like
57:53 - when you say fill a certain color every
57:55 - shape afterwards is colored according
57:58 - that fill unless you say fill again with
57:59 - a different color the same sort of thing
58:01 - applies to translate so now if I were to
58:05 - say rectangle you know 100 150 comma 10
58:15 - you can see there's that other rectangle
58:18 - it's drawn relative to where that origin
58:20 - was so now what's interesting about this
58:23 - is I can actually instead of saying
58:25 - translate 50 50 I could take translate
58:27 - Mouse X Mouse
58:30 - so now these move relative to that one
58:34 - position so this is one reason why this
58:36 - can be useful because you might want to
58:38 - think about this complex pattern that's
58:40 - all centered around or relative to one
58:42 - given point and you could move it all
58:45 - together just by altering the
58:46 - translation so this is one reason why
58:48 - it's useful oops wrong keyboard another
58:52 - reason why it's reusable is really the
58:54 - main purpose for this video
58:56 - rotate you cannot control the rotation
59:00 - of a shape you're drawing without the
59:03 - use of translate and why is that well
59:05 - rotation is not as simple as just saying
59:07 - rotate something so let me grab this
59:09 - eraser here if if you said to me you
59:12 - know rotate that eraser at 90 degrees I
59:14 - would say well okay I rotate it at 90
59:16 - degrees but we have this like bond you
59:18 - and me we can speak the language of
59:23 - angles and rotation without specifying
59:26 - but the computer does not have this bond
59:28 - with you it needs to know okay in
59:30 - addition to rotating just rotating by
59:32 - some angle I need to know like around
59:35 - what point should I rotate what's the
59:38 - origin
59:38 - what's the axis of rotation and so and
59:41 - what axis there's all sorts of questions
59:43 - so so this is what this is how this is
59:47 - why translate is so important because
59:48 - always always always rotation happens
59:52 - around the point of origin
59:55 - so if I translate to the and draw a
59:59 - rectangle at the corner it will 0 0 will
60:02 - rotate around its corner so and I have
60:05 - another way of describing this that I'm
60:06 - going to come back to in a second so let
60:08 - me explain what I mean by this let's
60:10 - come back let's put this rectangle at
60:13 - 5050 let's get rid of translate and I'm
60:16 - gonna say okay and here's the other
60:18 - thing
60:18 - hello angles time for a little review I
60:22 - think I have this a video for sure but
60:24 - since we're here let's talk about angles
60:26 - for a second so I have some room over
60:27 - here so if you're me you probably
60:30 - typically think of angles in terms of
60:32 - degrees this is like a 90-degree angle
60:35 - and this is a 45-degree angle and you
60:39 - know a full rotation is 360
60:42 - and we can actually use the unit of
60:44 - measurement degrees in p5 and I'm going
60:48 - to because there's a function where I
60:51 - can say angle mode and then I can say
60:53 - degrees to tell p5 I like to think in
60:59 - terms of degrees and you should think in
61:01 - terms of degrees also
61:02 - but natively and if you use other
61:04 - programming and graphics environments
61:05 - you might not be able to do this the
61:07 - native kind of unit of measurement for
61:11 - both computer graphics systems is
61:13 - something called I need more space maybe
61:21 - the problem was this eraser is bad and
61:23 - that's why grey wizard and the chat I
61:26 - think that the name rank was mentioning
61:28 - to me that I did I get a new eraser
61:30 - which apparently not so my erasing it's
61:33 - going to get edited out when these get
61:35 - published in standalone videos just ok a
61:43 - unit of measurement known as radians
61:51 - radians refers to arc length oh my
61:55 - goodness what's that well maybe I'll
61:57 - make a video about arcs someday but
61:59 - let's just think about a circle and
62:01 - pretend a circle is a unit circle what
62:05 - is a unit circle it means the radius is
62:07 - of length 1 1 pixel 1 centimeter 1 meter
62:13 - whatever it is let's say I want to know
62:16 - what is this angle right here in radians
62:19 - well it turns out that if I take this
62:22 - arc flatten it out and measure it that
62:27 - length is that angle in radians so
62:31 - radius is a way of describing and and
62:32 - and if you remember from some math class
62:34 - or you haven't taken this math class yet
62:36 - the circumference of a circle meaning
62:38 - the whole length of the entire outline
62:42 - of a circle the formula for calculating
62:44 - that is 2 pi R so if R is 1 it's just 2
62:50 - pi and guess what what is 360 degrees in
62:53 - radians it's 2 pi
62:55 - so I kind of got a little off track the
62:56 - point of what I'm talking about which is
62:57 - translating rotate but if I want to
63:00 - rotate something according to an angle I
63:01 - need to at least decide what unit of
63:03 - measurement I'm using by default we'll
63:05 - use radians let's make things a little
63:07 - simpler and let's switch it to degrees
63:08 - so I'm back over here now and I'm going
63:12 - to say right under create canvas angle
63:15 - mode angel mode
63:17 - let's let's activate angel mode degrees
63:20 - and now before this rectangle I am going
63:26 - to say rotate 45
63:28 - oh so that's good so let's let's add a
63:35 - variable
63:35 - have you tried variables yeah I don't
63:37 - know where this video fits into the
63:38 - playlist but variables and incidentally
63:42 - I'm gonna use this word let to create a
63:44 - variable which sometimes a future go is
63:47 - be silly that I'm saying it because all
63:48 - my videos will have left but this is
63:50 - kind of new say let a for all that angle
63:52 - equals 0 and I'm gonna put angle in here
63:55 - and then every time through draw I'm
63:58 - going to say angle equals angle plus 1
64:01 - so I'm gonna increase by 1 degrees
64:04 - what's going on here look at that oh
64:09 - it's gonna come back in a second can we
64:11 - wait do you mind waiting oh look
64:14 - there it is ok so what's it doing ah
64:16 - okay so what it's doing is this
64:20 - rectangle is at fifty fifty is rotating
64:25 - around the origin 0 0 by default if you
64:28 - just say rotate everything's gonna
64:29 - rotate around the origin so that's why
64:31 - we're seeing this happen you know it
64:35 - goes to here and then it goes to here
64:37 - and then it goes to here this is not a
64:39 - bad thing that might be what you want in
64:41 - fact maybe you want it to kind of like
64:44 - rotate around the center of the window
64:46 - so I could come back over here and I
64:49 - could say let's move the origin let me
64:52 - move the origin to 200 200 and now I
64:58 - have this rectangle that's rotating kind
65:00 - of around the center it's a little
65:02 - confusing I think it might help if I
65:03 - drew a line we could see what's going on
65:05 - here if I drew a line from 0 0 to fit
65:08 - t-50 well what what happened there so
65:15 - why didn't the line ah look what I did
65:18 - so this is really important and I make
65:20 - me keep this a little more complicated
65:21 - than I mean to but this is Sookie look
65:23 - at this I translated drew the line and
65:25 - then I rotate it and drew the rectangle
65:27 - so only the rectangle is rotating not
65:30 - the line the order of operations is so
65:32 - so important so let me put rotate up
65:35 - here then let me draw both a line and a
65:37 - rectangle after I translate to the
65:39 - center and rotate by that angle so I hit
65:42 - save I don't think so
65:44 - so now we can really see what's going on
65:46 - you can see here how it's rotating the
65:49 - or the point of origin the point of
65:51 - reference for that rotation is the
65:52 - center of the window wherever I've
65:54 - defined zero zero to be by translation
65:56 - and then this is there now why does this
65:58 - work this way I'm going to tell
66:00 - something and I'm pretty sure it was
66:03 - gold on Levin who I saw do a
66:05 - demonstration of this but I have a piece
66:08 - of paper this piece of paper I wanted to
66:12 - now be indicating I want it to be the
66:15 - canvas I'm gonna put it up here okay so
66:18 - what's actually happening let's say that
66:22 - I translate it to the center here right
66:26 - and now I'm going to say rotate 45
66:30 - degrees I'm gonna rotate this 45 degrees
66:34 - now what am I gonna do I want to draw a
66:36 - rectangle so I'm gonna draw it right
66:40 - down you even see this I draw a
66:43 - rectangle there we go
66:46 - look what I got can you see that so
66:51 - what's actually happening like in the
66:52 - computer's mind is this like turns the
66:55 - thing it transforms the view in essence
66:58 - of the actual Windows canvas itself that
67:01 - draws it as if it hadn't moved it at all
67:04 - but then what you actually see of course
67:06 - is not like the canvas doesn't move just
67:09 - your the view of it moves so what you're
67:10 - actually seeing is the rotated thing try
67:13 - this on your own
67:14 - somebody make a video that's much better
67:16 - than that Oh spike this is why I'll
67:18 - never do live physics demonstrations
67:20 - raising that because
67:21 - terrible about it okay nobody could see
67:22 - the drawing well like maybe we'll edit
67:24 - it I'll take a picture of it I'll edit
67:25 - it back in you can see it right now um
67:27 - yeah that was weird that I put it over
67:30 - here too right that's so strange
67:33 - okay anyway so you see what's going on
67:35 - here so what do I want to do what if I
67:38 - now want this rectangle to rotate around
67:41 - its center how am I going to handle that
67:43 - okay so let's go back to the code and
67:46 - I'm going to say okay well let's forget
67:49 - about this line for a second
67:50 - and let's put this rectangle back here
67:52 - let me run it again oh but where that's
67:55 - weird what's oh it's still doing what it
67:58 - did before what I want is to draw the
68:01 - rectangle at 0-0 if I draw the rectangle
68:06 - at the point of origin you can't then it
68:10 - will rotate around that kick myself like
68:12 - a weird fingernails on a chalkboard
68:14 - feeling there save refresh so you could
68:19 - see now it's rotating around that
68:21 - rectangles point of reference because
68:23 - that is zero zero and that's where the
68:25 - rectangle is if I wanted to rotate
68:27 - around its center let me say let me say
68:31 - look easy thing I can do is just say
68:33 - rect mode Center so I can tell the
68:36 - rectangle to reference its center and
68:38 - now I have a rectangle rotating around
68:40 - its center that's what I wanted and let
68:45 - me position it a little bit up in the
68:47 - corner more of the screen we could see
68:50 - it spinning over there let me have it
68:52 - go rotate by five degrees every frame
68:55 - and we can see there we go we have this
68:57 - rotating rectangle and it's sort of
69:00 - important to realize that if I was going
69:02 - to have something move around like if I
69:04 - was gonna have this thing move around
69:05 - I would probably then I would I'd have
69:07 - like an exposition and I might have a Y
69:10 - position and now what I would want to do
69:13 - is position the rectangles position is
69:15 - defined by translate x and y so now you
69:21 - can see this it's the same sketch as
69:22 - before but now if X changes so in
69:25 - addition to the angle changing if I were
69:27 - to say x equals x plus 2 or something
69:30 - now it's rotating and move
69:32 - so this is kind of interesting by the
69:33 - way and I have some future videos
69:35 - somewhere from the nature of code
69:37 - playlist that deal with like angular
69:38 - velocity if you're like throwing
69:40 - something and having it spin that's
69:41 - something you could sort of think about
69:42 - simulating but let me back up for a
69:44 - second I'm gonna get rid of the whole
69:45 - X&Y concept that's useful for you to
69:49 - think about and I I'm going to now make
69:55 - the graph the question what happens if I
69:58 - put a rectangle over here and I want it
70:00 - to rotate at a different speed in the
70:02 - opposite direction so let's give these
70:03 - some colors so we can distinguish them
70:05 - let's make this some reddish
70:09 - something-or-other and then I'm going to
70:10 - add another rectangle I'm gonna just put
70:14 - rect mode and set up just sort of as
70:16 - like kind of like a global setting for
70:18 - the program then I'm going to draw
70:20 - another rectangle and I'm gonna give it
70:26 - a different color and where do I want it
70:28 - to be I want it to be kind of at like
70:32 - this is 400 by 400 so let me put it at
70:34 - 300 300 so I'm gonna put it at 300 300
70:41 - oh where you go yeah so what's going on
70:49 - so one of the things you have to
70:50 - remember is that this translate and
70:53 - rotate affects everything after it so
70:55 - here's a way I could fix that I could
70:57 - just let me just take that translate and
70:58 - rotate and put it afterwards I just put
71:00 - an afterwards just put it after so I
71:01 - just went after it don't worry about it
71:02 - now I've got that rotating with this not
71:05 - rotating because I drew the blue
71:07 - rectangle first then I translated rotate
71:09 - it and got the other thing and this
71:10 - doesn't affect because every time
71:12 - through draw every time through draw
71:16 - transformations reset back to nothing
71:18 - back to zero zero being the top left
71:19 - with no rotation but this is not really
71:23 - a viable solution because I mean I'd
71:25 - like you to draw it in a different order
71:26 - and I might want this thing to rotate so
71:28 - if I were to like translate rotate this
71:30 - is going to affect the other thing
71:31 - so how do I deal with this now don't get
71:33 - me wrong sometimes once again we want
71:35 - this right remember what if I just
71:37 - wanted a little tiny rectangle offset by
71:42 - a little bit rotating around so you can
71:45 - I might actually want this to be the
71:47 - project I want things to be relative and
71:49 - then this is good that they follow each
71:51 - other but in the case of me wanting it
71:55 - to be in the corner separate how do i
71:59 - how do I stop it so one thing you might
72:01 - think to yourself is ah undo well let's
72:04 - see if I translate into 50/50 then I
72:06 - wrote Tintin I drew the thing I know I
72:08 - know I can rotate back by negative the
72:11 - angle okay that undoes the rotation and
72:14 - then I can rotate back by negative fifty
72:17 - negative 50 so I'm gonna undo I'm gonna
72:19 - go backwards and like um reassemble we
72:22 - put this canvas back in the right spot
72:24 - let me hit save and we hit refresh look
72:27 - that worked so that works but this also
72:30 - this is a really not a viable solution
72:33 - because someday I'm gonna create a
72:34 - program with so many transformations for
72:37 - so many different things and want some
72:38 - things to be related some things some
72:39 - things to be independent this mean
72:41 - having to keep track of it myself and
72:42 - undo everything is kind of a nightmare
72:44 - there is actually a function called
72:47 - reset matrix which will actually and why
72:49 - are we calling it Matrix will reset
72:50 - everything but really the function that
72:52 - I'm looking for the one that I haven't
72:54 - bothered to mention yet are these push
72:56 - and pop so you can think about push
72:59 - another word for push in this case being
73:04 - safe and pop another word for pop being
73:09 - restore so I can save the current
73:14 - transformation state where is the origin
73:17 - what's the rotation by the way there's
73:18 - also scale so I haven't mentioned or
73:21 - showing you scale but that's another
73:22 - transformation I can save the state and
73:24 - then I can do a whole bunch of stuff and
73:27 - then I can restore it so kind of like in
73:28 - an undo kind of way so let's look at how
73:30 - that works so I can say right here
73:34 - before I do my first translation let me
73:37 - say save save whatever things were
73:40 - before I do this now I could do some
73:42 - stuff that I could undo it by saying pop
73:46 - so this ultimately has the same effect
73:49 - as it back backing out of what I did
73:52 - before so you can kind of this is a way
73:54 - putting push at the top and pop at the
73:56 - bottom around some code
73:57 - is the way of thinking that code
73:59 - self-contained in its own transformation
74:01 - world and now if i refresh we can see
74:07 - there we go it's this this rectangle is
74:11 - completely independent of that rectangle
74:12 - and now I could do something like
74:16 - instead of instead of drawing the
74:18 - rectangle at 300 300 I could translate
74:20 - to 300 300 I could draw the rectangle at
74:24 - 0-0 and I could say something like a
74:26 - rotate by a negative angle times 3 so
74:29 - I'm just going to reuse the same
74:30 - variable but have it be faster or
74:33 - something and we can see this so we can
74:35 - see now I have my one rectangle rotating
74:38 - this way independently of this one
74:40 - rotating the other way so I have a
74:44 - feeling that I've missed a whole bunch
74:45 - of things I've missed talking about
74:47 - scale I miss like that why it's push and
74:50 - pop one of those terms mean so I think
74:52 - I'm gonna pause here for a second
74:55 - timeout and oh yeah me I am so me as
75:03 - making a good point to the chat that
75:04 - there's a width thing and I'm just
75:10 - wondering if I've missed anything okay
75:17 - no I'm just looking at the chat okay I'm
75:20 - going to I'm gonna so cuz I think I
75:27 - should have paused but so I'm gonna come
75:30 - back and in the next video if you're
75:32 - interested I'm gonna do a cup one thing
75:34 - I'm going to talk a little bit about
75:35 - what's actually going on a bit more
75:37 - behind the scenes why is it called push
75:39 - and pop what is this function reset
75:41 - matrix do why is there a matrix I'm
75:43 - gonna talk about that a little bit I
75:44 - also need to show you scale a little bit
75:46 - more which I think could be useful okay
75:48 - thanks for watching and stay tuned for
75:49 - another video I guess okay
75:53 - well Sam I get it - okay bye
75:56 - okay all right everyone I forgot to get
75:59 - my spill my water so okay well how did
76:03 - we do apply matrix K week Mon is asking
76:06 - about apply matrix yeah I never really
76:09 - used these functions but I will I will
76:11 - mention it I was trying to do this with
76:13 - avoiding my whole plan was to do this
76:15 - video avoiding talking about matrices
76:17 - because that's an interesting piece of
76:19 - this of course but to just when you're
76:21 - first learning and figuring this out you
76:23 - don't really need to do any the matrix
76:25 - stuff yourself but someone in the chat
76:30 - is asking what do you think about
76:31 - learning Java is my first language you
76:33 - know don't be like me I loved mostly
76:39 - because I I really the first programming
76:42 - environment that I started to use deeply
76:45 - with process processing and processing
76:46 - is built on top of Java ok p5 is a
76:51 - library yes alright so let me think here
76:57 - I'm gonna have to take a break to fill
76:59 - up my water delivery device in a second
77:05 - how are we on time 502 that's not so bad
77:11 - so what I'm gonna do is let's so let me
77:16 - erase this as much as I want to keep it
77:22 - and then the camera went off of course
77:32 - all right so the camera went off where
77:35 - is my I used to have this whole thing of
77:37 - paper towels because I could use this
77:41 - water thing to like erase this but I'm
77:44 - just gonna aggressively use my left arm
77:48 - this should've practiced like explaining
77:58 - this in class or something had this
77:59 - erasers terrible and then this will gone
78:04 - more smoothly this is fine that's what
78:09 - you were saying a new eraser I must have
78:12 - had this before and it looks like it's a
78:13 - bad eraser but I do have a hold on stay
78:20 - with me everybody I'm actually not gonna
78:23 - it's gonna be a hot mic moment I'm gonna
78:25 - go out play this music paper towel and
78:30 - I'm going to erase the hallway
78:59 - [Music]
79:04 - all right you know interestingly enough
79:10 - I realized that when I switch to the
79:11 - whiteboard to music all right all right
79:20 - now this should do the trick
79:26 - there we go look at that beautiful
79:29 - erasing glorious I can't want to think I
79:41 - can't do yet is push so I have like no
79:44 - strength up here so I can't push I can
79:46 - do with my left with that that will come
79:51 - back all right so maybe what I should do
80:01 - actually is first talk about scale
80:06 - because there's some crazy stuff there's
80:10 - some crazy stuff you can do with scale
80:18 - there's some kind of crazy stuff you can
80:20 - do a scale the thing that I would like
80:21 - to do is create a world that you can
80:26 - zoom in and out of with scale but it's
80:29 - like two DS oom so all right so let me
80:36 - try to do that I need to get someone at
80:40 - some point but so I don't know that I
80:41 - really need to erase that but okay so
80:43 - let me what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
80:46 - make just
80:53 - I'm gonna make separate boy I really
80:56 - should've I did this like a long time
80:58 - ago let me look for this so a long time
81:02 - let me see if I can find this this is
81:06 - gonna be a really random google search
81:07 - but it didn't work so there uh spell
81:18 - Hanukkah wrong you might be wondering
81:22 - why am i googling Hanukkah
81:24 - Schiffman blog zoom to the scale I don't
81:29 - yeah there we go look at this I found it
81:32 - zoom and pan into D so a long long time
81:34 - ago this was 2011 I made up this example
81:39 - let's see if I can download it it still
81:44 - exists it still seems to exist this is
81:48 - gonna be processing code this is from
81:50 - six years ago now this comes up all the
81:53 - time how to do this so I want to take a
81:58 - look at it this could be actually a
81:59 - coding challenge to be perfectly honest
82:02 - rather than a tutorial video yes so the
82:09 - idea here is that this I can like kind
82:13 - of move this thing around boy this is
82:17 - like the worst demo ever kind of like a
82:20 - tile map sort of thing that you can zoom
82:22 - in and pan around so that's kind of
82:25 - something interesting to think about and
82:28 - that example I'll put a link to that
82:30 - okay all right let me that was a bit of
82:35 - an aside so do I want to do scale so
82:40 - hold on Desktop transformations oh yeah
82:45 - now what I need to do I messed up here
82:47 - is go back to terminal
82:53 - Oh actually I don't need to do anything
82:56 - there and I need to close this and there
83:01 - we go
83:02 - so let's
83:12 - so host our apologies I'm just kind of
83:19 - putting this back into some sort of
83:21 - state that we can use oops so that's the
83:27 - example I just made and now here is the
83:30 - next whoa what did I do here oh I forgot
83:32 - angle mode degrees and somewhere I lost
83:43 - rectum mode Center okay and let me make
83:48 - this
83:57 - okay so what I want to do now is look at
84:02 - scale so I want to look at the scale
84:05 - function okay so simple why I I didn't
84:11 - do a good job of thinking through how to
84:13 - make this multiple parts but let's find
84:16 - short videos are good hey hello okay so
84:23 - this is kind of like a little bit of a
84:24 - part two tutorial about transformations
84:26 - and what I want to do is show you what
84:28 - the scale function does and I don't know
84:30 - that this merits its own video but I
84:32 - didn't fit in it to last one so that's
84:34 - why I'm doing it so what does the scale
84:36 - function do so first of all we see I
84:39 - know there's some other important
84:40 - details that would fill in about pushing
84:41 - top perhaps in this video so we
84:44 - established that translate moves the
84:49 - point of origin if you translate to some
84:52 - point you're translating where the
84:54 - origin is and you're drawing everything
84:56 - relative to that new location rotate
84:59 - rotates the view of the canvas so that
85:02 - as you draw things it appears as if the
85:04 - shapes are rotating itself so so if we
85:07 - were to rotate by an angle and then draw
85:08 - something at zero zero relative to its
85:10 - corner we might see a rectangle
85:11 - something like this rotated by some
85:13 - angle scale stretches everything out or
85:17 - shrinks everything relative also to zero
85:20 - zero and there's some really goofy stuff
85:23 - you can do a scale so scale can actually
85:27 - take one argument or scale can take two
85:30 - arguments so I could scale the same
85:33 - amount along the X and the y axis or I
85:36 - could scale I could stretch something
85:37 - along the x axis and shrink something
85:39 - along the y axis plus I can also put
85:42 - negative numbers in here and what
85:45 - negative numbers do is they not so so
85:47 - what is the number what is it if I put
85:49 - one everywhere this just means 100% the
85:52 - default scale that's just what it is if
85:56 - I were to put two in here suddenly the
85:59 - rectangle will be twice to size I've
86:01 - scaled it by 200% point five I've shrunk
86:05 - it 50% if so I could do it if things are
86:09 - the different axes
86:10 - the x-axis the y-axis but I can also
86:11 - like flip the axis so if I were to flip
86:14 - the axis that means this rectangle would
86:16 - now appear over here we should draw in
86:19 - the other direction so I can actually
86:21 - use scale to say Y doesn't point down
86:23 - but Y points up which sometimes you want
86:26 - to do if you want to you know create
86:27 - some type of simulation where you're
86:28 - thinking about the coordinate system
86:30 - differently so let's go take a look at
86:32 - this now in action so if I have this
86:35 - sketch here where now all I'm doing is
86:36 - them have a simple transformation where
86:38 - I'm translating to the center and I'm
86:40 - rotating the view so that this rectangle
86:42 - rotates around on its own I can do
86:44 - things like say scale for let's just say
86:50 - scale for and now I have this much
86:53 - larger wreck down oh this is something
86:54 - very important something very important
86:56 - about this look at this what's the
86:58 - difference between saints scale for and
87:00 - just saying draw the rectangle instead
87:03 - of 100 comma 50 let's multiply that by 4
87:06 - 400 comma 200
87:08 - so let's actually I'm going to comment
87:09 - out now scale 4 and I'm going to say
87:13 - rectangle 0 0 400 comma 200 the math is
87:17 - kind of the same here I'm not drawing it
87:18 - 4 times the width 4 times the height now
87:22 - I'm going to refresh and watch closely
87:24 - what is the what's different just going
87:27 - to look the same as look different think
87:29 - about it think about it think about it
87:30 - well it's the same size but look at the
87:33 - outline now the outline is only one
87:35 - pixel wide because the stroke weight is
87:38 - 1 so scale is not just making things
87:41 - bigger in the sense that shapes now have
87:44 - a larger width and height but it's
87:46 - actually zooming in on that
87:47 - two-dimensional shape giving your view
87:50 - of the window scaled up so even the
87:52 - width of the stroke gets bigger and so
87:55 - if I go back to here we can do things
87:57 - like you know I could scale according to
88:01 - you know Mouse X divided by 100 so if I
88:05 - do that we can see it's kind of like a
88:08 - 3d effect it's creating a 3d effect in
88:13 - 2d but similarly to how you might work
88:15 - with something like a map API where
88:18 - zooming in and out of a map for more
88:20 - detail or less detail and this is
88:21 - something I would like to do in a future
88:22 - coding challenge which is to create a
88:24 - kind of 2d zoom and pan of a scene and
88:27 - you could do that now of everything I'm
88:28 - giving you because if I just add
88:29 - translate to this right if I'm able to
88:31 - like move the mouse around to translate
88:34 - then I also have pan essentially you
88:37 - know how do I click and drag and is
88:39 - there an offset and that they the
88:40 - interactivity there's a little tricky
88:42 - but it's certainly possible so that's
88:43 - the main thing to say about scale let's
88:46 - look at let's look at what it what it
88:49 - means to do this with different values
88:51 - so I could say scale for in the
88:53 - x-direction and 0.5 in the y-direction
88:57 - as you can see this weirdness I've like
88:59 - stretched it out along the X but shrug
89:01 - it's very weird to look at this let's
89:03 - let's actually say mouse X divided by
89:06 - 100 mouse Y divided by 100 so let's see
89:11 - what that looks like so you can see here
89:13 - and it's a little container also just to
89:16 - make this a little bit more clear so you
89:18 - can see this is me now kind of
89:20 - stretching it and scaling it in in other
89:23 - directions now one thing I want to do
89:26 - here hold hold on is I'm gonna say I'm
89:29 - gonna just put scale 1 comma 1 and I'm
89:35 - going to take out rect mode Center so
89:38 - look the rectangle is now drawn route
89:41 - with the corner at 0 0 off to the right
89:44 - what if I were to say scale negative 1
89:48 - scale negative 1 so just negative in the
89:51 - X direction now the everything goes the
89:54 - other way so this is quite interesting
89:57 - and I could back up for a second and put
89:58 - the rotation back and actually say let's
90:01 - leave let's put the scale is so now I
90:03 - have this notice how it's rotating
90:05 - clockwise clockwise if I say scale 1 and
90:10 - then negative 1 here oh whoa it's still
90:16 - rotating clockwise of course it's still
90:18 - rotating clockwise freaking myself out
90:23 - here how many make it rotate the other
90:25 - way timeout we have to think about this
90:30 - if
90:31 - still rotating clockwise alone let's go
90:33 - back to this let's take the rotation out
90:39 - so it flips it up the way it's drawn but
90:42 - rotation still goes that way is there a
90:44 - way to use scale to change the rotation
90:47 - I know I could change angle equals angle
90:49 - minus two yes yes I'm aware of that fact
90:51 - I was just thinking to scale actually
90:54 - alter the direction of rotation I don't
90:59 - think I guess it doesn't just alters the
91:01 - direction that you're drawing stuff but
91:03 - it would rotate the other way weirdly I
91:05 - guess maybe it does if maybe if you're
91:07 - in 3d in your eyes explicitly saying
91:09 - like rotate Z or something or rotate Y
91:14 - does not affect the rotation and people
91:16 - are gonna rotate after this oh oh where
91:25 - is well hold on wait a sec yeah oh of
91:28 - course of course this has to come
91:32 - afterwards there we go I expected it to
91:35 - do that and yet it didn't thank you
91:39 - everybody in the chat this is why
91:40 - programming graphics is hard okay
91:44 - so I don't know where to like come back
91:47 - to I'm gonna come back to where it
91:49 - didn't change the rotation I'm gonna
91:52 - come back to here I took a little break
91:55 - there to figure this out because I kind
91:57 - of like my mind stopped working I
91:59 - thought when I can't let let me let me
92:01 - step you through this so I'm going to
92:03 - turn the rotation off and let me put
92:05 - scale back to 1 comma 1 so this is the
92:09 - rectangle drawn pointing down Y points
92:12 - down if I were to change the Y scale to
92:17 - negative 1 now Y points up so that
92:20 - rectangle is drawn up in the upwards
92:22 - direction and then I added rotate back
92:24 - in and shouldn't if Y now points up
92:27 - shouldn't it also rotate backwards well
92:30 - it's not rotating backwards it's still
92:32 - rotating the same way but once again I
92:34 - forgot about order of operations rotate
92:39 - happens before scale so I rotate the
92:42 - view and then I flip the Y so it's
92:44 - drawing
92:45 - the other direction but it's rotating
92:46 - still before I scale so this is now
92:50 - before rotate look what happens now now
92:54 - let's rotate now of course I could if I
92:55 - just wanted to rotate the other way I
92:57 - could just rotate by a negative angle I
92:58 - don't need to use scale for that the
93:00 - speed of rotation the animal rotation
93:02 - that could all be controlled through
93:03 - math that wasn't the point but this
93:05 - actually comes up because a great
93:08 - scenario for this is what if you want to
93:10 - take an image and mirror it so you want
93:12 - to draw the image mirrored well you
93:13 - might think I'll rewrite all the pixels
93:15 - in the opposite direction you can
93:16 - actually use scale to flip the image and
93:19 - draw it in the reverse direction and
93:20 - this can be something that you could try
93:22 - if you're working with edge isn't that
93:23 - sort of thing all right so that's what I
93:26 - want to say about scale if you're
93:27 - looking for a challenge to do try to
93:29 - make a scene that you can sign it zoom
93:31 - it almost as if like a map that you can
93:33 - zoom and pan around in a 2d way using
93:36 - scale push/pop translate rotate if you
93:38 - do that share it with me I would love to
93:41 - check it out and hopefully I'll interest
93:43 - I'll come back and do that in a coding
93:44 - Jon's video I'm gonna do one more video
93:46 - just in case I forgot anything I want to
93:48 - talk a little bit about why it's called
93:50 - push and pop and why there are some
93:52 - other functions that have this like
93:53 - matrix word in it you should probably
93:55 - just skip that video watch I haven't
93:57 - made it yet
93:57 - I mean maybe when you're watching this
93:59 - it'll be there or won't be there he'll
94:00 - come out but I'm gonna try so who knows
94:02 - maybe it'll be fine see you thank you
94:04 - goodbye alright okay so hopefully that
94:11 - helped people there's a nice chat going
94:16 - on here in the patron group in slack
94:20 - where's my paper towel so let me let me
94:26 - erase again you can't see me now so of
94:31 - course what happens to me is I think
94:33 - this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do
94:35 - this that I'm gonna do transformations
94:37 - then I'm gonna do custom shapes then I'm
94:40 - gonna do a coding challenge and you know
94:42 - everything takes so much longer which is
94:45 - probably my fault I think I I don't I
94:48 - like the videos not to be
94:50 - left arm so what I'm gonna talk about in
94:59 - this next video in very and I want to
95:07 - see something because been processing I
95:09 - used to know how to do this you could
95:10 - say print matrix no print matrix not
95:14 - implemented how do I get access to it so
95:23 - pick matrix is a function used to use in
95:25 - processing to show people the underlying
95:27 - data let's go back to reference
95:33 - transform apply matrix reset matrix so
95:40 - there's no but there's got to be the
95:41 - matrix has to be there in a data in a in
95:45 - a variable somewhere what would it be
95:47 - like let me see if I can look this up so
95:54 - let's let's let's have a little
95:55 - digression here if somebody knows how I
95:58 - can easily show the matrix oh I'm in the
96:02 - white board sorry everybody you guys
96:04 - couldn't see what I'm doing there's a
96:06 - new used to be a phone there is a
96:07 - function in processing called print
96:09 - matrix which I Lee have used just for
96:11 - educational purposes to show like when
96:13 - you call rotate like the numbers change
96:29 - you
96:31 - you
