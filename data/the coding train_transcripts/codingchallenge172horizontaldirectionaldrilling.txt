00:00 - hello welcome to a coding challenge i am
00:02 - just thrilled to be here i have had a
00:04 - wonderful invitation from my friend
00:06 - grady over at practical engineering to
00:09 - work on a simulation of horizontal
00:12 - directional drilling now if you had
00:13 - asked me a year ago hey are you ever
00:16 - going to do a coding challenge about
00:17 - horizontal directional drilling would
00:19 - say like what's that and probably not
00:21 - that doesn't sound like a thing i would
00:22 - do but after some research after being
00:25 - taught about this from grady i am just
00:28 - fascinated and i think there is
00:30 - potential to create a fun playable 2d
00:34 - casual game where you are
00:36 - the horizontal directional driller so
00:38 - what is horizontal directional drilling
00:40 - well you don't need to listen to me
00:41 - explain to it i've linked to practical
00:43 - engineering's video on the topic it's
00:45 - very well researched gives you lots of
00:47 - context and backstory as well as many
00:50 - amazing demonstrations of doing it on
00:52 - big and small scales
00:54 - grady was also kind enough to send me
00:55 - this diagram which sort of shows a
00:57 - scenario of how it might play out with a
00:59 - whole lot of suggestions for how this
01:01 - could be turned into a game from
01:02 - practice mode hard mode and other ideas
01:05 - i'm going to try to take all of that
01:08 - and synthesize it down into the simplest
01:10 - case scenario diagram it here on the
01:12 - whiteboard and then code it up
01:18 - all right my artistic skills aside here
01:20 - is the scenario we're dealing with in an
01:22 - overly simplified manner especially
01:24 - given the fact that this is completely
01:26 - two-dimensional we need to run some pipe
01:28 - from point a
01:30 - to point b
01:32 - if there were no river we could just
01:33 - excavate drop the pipe in and back fill
01:36 - it in but this river is here and also
01:39 - maybe there's some other restrictions
01:40 - that we can't dig up all the land so
01:42 - could we sort of thread the needle so to
01:45 - speak how could we just thread a pipe in
01:46 - and curve it around and steer it that's
01:48 - what horizontal directional drilling
01:50 - does now it involves all sorts of real
01:52 - world considerations drilling fluid and
01:55 - materials i'm not going to concern
01:56 - myself with any of that i'm just going
01:58 - to look at the mechanic of how the
02:00 - controller steers the drill and create a
02:03 - simulation mini game out of that now
02:06 - again i have very little real world
02:07 - experience with this but a regular drill
02:10 - you know the drill bit might just look
02:11 - like this
02:13 - obviously with some ridges and edges and
02:15 - markings and stuff to make it you know
02:17 - cut into things for horizontal
02:19 - directional drilling also sometimes
02:20 - called directional boring the drill bit
02:22 - itself will usually have something askew
02:24 - at the end we can think of it as like oh
02:26 - it comes off and it kind of points down
02:29 - this is what gives it a bias
02:31 - so as it's going into the ground and
02:34 - drilling this bias will cause it to
02:37 - curve down
02:39 - so that the drill as it's inserted
02:42 - it could start curving down in a 3d
02:44 - world this bias might be something that
02:46 - we fully rotate but here in our 2d
02:48 - scenario i'm just going to think of it
02:49 - as either pointing down or pointing up
02:51 - so pointing down for negative one and we
02:53 - could flip it to pointing up
02:56 - if i flip it pointing up it's going to
02:58 - start to curve the other way
03:00 - the drill is always turning there's no
03:03 - way for it to go straight so the
03:05 - challenge is if i have a drill that's
03:07 - always turning either up or down left or
03:09 - right on or off plus one minus one how
03:12 - can i effectively steer it through a
03:14 - complex path there could be all sorts of
03:16 - other stuff in the way here there could
03:17 - be other lines we don't want to
03:18 - interrupt strange rock formations i
03:20 - don't know what's underneath the earth
03:21 - and what engineers really deal with but
03:23 - we've got to be able to get some kind of
03:25 - control over steering this i think we've
03:27 - got what we need though for me to be
03:28 - able to get started coding here's the
03:31 - base code i'm going to start with now if
03:32 - for some reason this is the first time
03:34 - you're watching the coding train hello
03:35 - welcome
03:38 - this is p5.js a javascript framework for
03:41 - creative coding i use it in almost all
03:43 - of my videos if you've never coded
03:45 - before i do happen to have a complete
03:47 - intro beginner series there will be
03:49 - things in this video that you don't
03:50 - understand if you haven't coded before
03:52 - but i'll try my best to walk you through
03:54 - it and then you can always refer back to
03:55 - some of my intro videos to fill in the
03:57 - gaps when i'm starting with the same
03:59 - scene here a canvas with some ground and
04:02 - a river and my drill is going to start
04:05 - somewhere around here on the left i'm
04:09 - going to use p5 vectors as the main data
04:12 - structure to keep track of where is the
04:14 - drill and what direction is it moving
04:17 - so first thing first a position variable
04:20 - for the drill
04:25 - and i've put a little dot in the canvas
04:26 - for where the drill is going to begin i
04:29 - have the drill position what else do i
04:31 - need well i need a variable to keep
04:33 - track of the drill direction like what
04:36 - direction is it currently drilling in as
04:39 - well as the bias is the bias of the
04:41 - drill bit pointing up or pointing down
04:44 - this is again a physical thing that's
04:46 - either flipped up or flipped down plus
04:48 - one or negative one
04:52 - dir for direction
04:54 - bias for bias and i'm going to
04:55 - initialize the bias as negative one
04:58 - and the direction as a vector
05:00 - pointing horizontally
05:02 - straight i mean i guess we could start
05:04 - maybe the drill should start pointing
05:05 - down i don't know what would be typical
05:08 - you have to go you can't go in the earth
05:10 - this way so yeah let's have it pointing
05:11 - down
05:13 - so the simplest thing i could do right
05:15 - now would be to write a function call it
05:16 - drill
05:18 - and then in that function i could add
05:20 - the direction to the position
05:23 - and if i were to then call drill here in
05:26 - draw which happens over and over again
05:28 - you can see the drill is moving down so
05:30 - obviously i need to add this idea of the
05:32 - bias and being able to steer it around
05:34 - but before i even do that i'd like to
05:37 - draw the full path i think that will
05:39 - really help us in terms of visualizing
05:41 - the process here
05:44 - i'm going to use an array and every time
05:46 - i move the position right before i move
05:49 - it let's make a copy of where it was
05:51 - that's essentially the previous position
05:54 - it's very important that i make a copy
05:56 - because these are objects if i just add
05:59 - the object directly without making a
06:00 - copy i'm adding a reference to it and
06:02 - then i just have many many many many
06:04 - references to the same point so when
06:06 - that point moves they all move then in
06:08 - draw i can use begin shape and end shape
06:10 - to connect all the previous points with
06:12 - a line
06:16 - loop through everything in the path
06:20 - and you can now see this black line
06:22 - trailing behind the red dot now instead
06:24 - of drawing that red dot i'd like to
06:26 - visualize the drill bit so we can see
06:28 - what's going on in which direction the
06:30 - bias is pointing so let me first just
06:32 - draw it as a line pointing down
06:36 - and now i want to rotate it a skew up or
06:38 - down
06:40 - up i don't know which way is what but to
06:42 - rotate this line i need to make use of
06:44 - transformation another topic that you
06:46 - may or may not be familiar with but
06:48 - luckily for you i have a whole set of
06:49 - videos about transformations in p5
06:51 - transformations come up any time you
06:53 - need to rotate something so i want to
06:54 - rotate by let's say pi divided by six
06:58 - it's like 30 degrees times the bias so
07:01 - positive or negative direction of course
07:02 - you can see now that's way in the wrong
07:04 - place this is where i need to translate
07:07 - to the point of origin to have the
07:08 - rotation work correctly
07:14 - and there you go so let's start it
07:15 - actually at entering in around 30
07:17 - degrees
07:19 - i could create a vector from an angle
07:22 - interesting hmm
07:24 - let's try flipping the bias oh let's add
07:27 - a button for that
07:31 - so what this bit of code does is it
07:33 - creates a button attaches a mouse
07:35 - pressed event to it and whenever the
07:37 - mouse is pressed that bias is multiplied
07:39 - by negative one making it positive or
07:41 - negative or vice versa but look at that
07:44 - the drill bit is not pointing in the
07:46 - direction that the drill is actually
07:47 - going it's always just flipping left or
07:49 - right from pointing down so we need to
07:51 - also incorporate the heading of the
07:53 - drill bit itself into where the bias is
07:55 - pointing
07:57 - i've made an error here where i
07:59 - originally drew the drill bit pointing
08:01 - down but all of the rotation and angles
08:03 - are relative to the horizontal axis so
08:05 - for all this to work nicely i should be
08:07 - drawing the drill bit pointing to the
08:09 - right
08:10 - i also made another error which is that
08:12 - the heading is the heading
08:14 - the bias is affecting whether i'm
08:16 - rotating to up or down based on that
08:18 - heading so i want to multiply the bias
08:20 - only by that offset which is pi divided
08:23 - by 6. there we go now we can see the
08:26 - drill bit
08:28 - toggling between pointing up down up
08:30 - down up down up now no matter what angle
08:34 - we start with for example 90 degrees
08:37 - it's still going to work
08:39 - i can even start from zero degrees
08:42 - and you can see i'm still able to toggle
08:44 - and visually everything's looking right
08:46 - i'm actually doing this live on twitch
08:47 - and the chat is asking a great question
08:49 - should we be using push and pop here and
08:52 - i don't need to because i'm not drawing
08:54 - anything else after drawing the drill
08:56 - bit but it would be really good to
08:57 - protect myself by using it this
09:00 - translate and rotate will affect
09:02 - anything that comes afterwards that
09:03 - drill function don't let that mislead
09:05 - you that's not drawing anything but one
09:07 - i might say logically it might make more
09:09 - sense to put drill at the beginning
09:11 - and then put a push and pop around here
09:16 - all right i kind of went about this in a
09:17 - strange order because i really was
09:19 - working on just visualizing all these
09:20 - elements the key here is actually taking
09:22 - the bias and having it affect the
09:24 - direction to which the drill turns
09:26 - remember it's always turning it's like a
09:28 - shark it's always got to turn it can't
09:30 - go straight that's not what a shark does
09:31 - the shark always keeps moving you get
09:32 - the idea though this begs the question
09:34 - how much does the drill actually turn
09:36 - now i'm sure again there are real world
09:37 - values for all of these things i'm going
09:39 - to make up a value
09:41 - i'm going to call it angle .01 a small
09:44 - incremental change and i'm going to say
09:46 - direction rotate by that angle times the
09:50 - bias oop
09:52 - my drill it's taking off to space i have
09:55 - defied all the laws of physics it's
09:57 - amazing let's have the bias pointing
09:59 - down to start and now here we go
10:02 - i'm gonna try to toggle that bias
10:05 - curve back
10:07 - i gotta get to the other side
10:09 - [Music]
10:12 - oh no oh no don't hit the water
10:15 - now you can see if i just keep toggling
10:16 - it over and over again i'm that's
10:18 - essentially how i'm getting to go in a
10:19 - straight line and can i make it to the
10:21 - other side
10:23 - come on keep going
10:25 - [Music]
10:27 - we did it horizontal directional
10:30 - drilling coding challenge complete so
10:33 - what's next here certainly i shouldn't
10:34 - be allowing the drill to sort of orbit
10:36 - in this strange way i need to add
10:38 - collision detection to see if it hits
10:40 - water maybe the scene should be
10:42 - procedurally generated in a different
10:44 - every time i could have an easy mode and
10:46 - a hard mode if you're actually doing
10:48 - this in real life you don't see
10:50 - everything underground and have a
10:52 - complete view of the entire world of
10:53 - what you're doing so i would encourage
10:55 - you to take this as a code base and see
10:58 - how you can expand it share it with me
11:00 - on the coding train website there's a
11:01 - form you can submit links to your
11:03 - versions of horizontal directional
11:04 - drilling but i also have made hopefully
11:07 - not right now but by the time you're
11:08 - watching this a fully playable version
11:10 - of this game
11:11 - that code will be on github i've made a
11:14 - list of all sorts of new features and
11:16 - ideas that could be added to this by the
11:18 - time you're watching this a lot of those
11:19 - will be implemented maybe there'll be
11:20 - some new ones so come check out play the
11:23 - demo enjoy it contribute to this make
11:25 - your own version share it with me and
11:28 - see you next time on the coding train
