00:00 - [TRAIN WHISTLE]
00:00 - Hello, and welcome to a
supplemental p5.js tutorial.
00:04 - In this tutorial,
I'm going to show you
00:06 - how to use localStorage.
00:08 - Have you ever wanted
your p5 sketch
00:11 - to start up where
it last left off?
00:13 - Do you not feel like
trying to figure out
00:16 - some kind of complex cloud
database storage solution?
00:19 - Then you're in exactly
the right place.
00:21 - LocalStorage is for you.
00:23 - If you're like me and you have
a 90-day Wordle streak going,
00:27 - [BUZZ] how does your
phone or your computer
00:30 - know that you've been
playing it every day?
00:31 - You didn't log in.
00:33 - You didn't sign up for anything.
00:34 - It just remembers you
were there yesterday.
00:36 - If you go to a
different computer,
00:37 - it doesn't know who you are.
00:39 - This is all due
to local storage.
00:41 - Local storage means saving data
locally in the browser itself--
00:48 - your browser on your
computer and there only.
00:52 - It's not a robust database
solution for user accounts
00:56 - or high scores and
multiplayer games,
00:58 - or anything that really needs
proper network communication
01:01 - and data storage in the cloud.
01:03 - But for just having a p5
sketch that runs and picks
01:07 - some colors, and then
the next time you run it,
01:09 - those colors come back just
for you working locally
01:12 - on your own computer,
it is just perfect.
01:15 - So here I am in this tutorial
with a very basic p5.js sketch.
01:19 - It creates three sliders, each
with a range between 0 and 255,
01:24 - starting with the value of 0.
01:25 - Then, in the draw loop, I pull
the values from each slider
01:29 - and use them to set the color
values of the background.
01:32 - Some red, a little bit of green.
01:35 - Let's add a lot of blue.
01:36 - Let's take out
some of the green.
01:37 - Let's add some more red.
01:38 - And then we have-- mwah--
01:40 - a beautiful pink.
01:41 - What if I want, the next
time I run this sketch,
01:45 - to see that pink color again?
01:47 - It's not going to happen
just by rerunning the sketch.
01:50 - Anytime you run a p5.js
sketch, whether you're
01:53 - loading it for the first time
or rerunning it in the p5 Web
01:56 - Editor, it starts fresh.
01:58 - LocalStorage is something that
comes as part of JavaScript
02:01 - and the browser API.
02:03 - It's part of the
browser Window object.
02:05 - And we could go through how to
access, save, and retrieve data
02:10 - from local storage
in plain JavaScript.
02:12 - But I'm here using p5.
02:14 - And wouldn't you
know it-- ah, mwah--
02:16 - if you needed another
reason to love p5,
02:18 - it's got a set of
helper wrapper functions
02:20 - that allow you to put
things in local storage
02:22 - and retrieve them whenever
it's convenient for you.
02:25 - There are only two
functions you need to know
02:27 - in p5 to use local storage.
02:29 - They're both found
in the P5 Reference--
02:31 - storeItem and getItem.
02:33 - They do exactly like what
they sound like they do.
02:37 - StoreItem stores something
in local storage, getItem
02:40 - retrieves it from local storage.
02:42 - First thing first,
I need to figure out
02:44 - when do I want to store the
red, green, and blue values
02:47 - in local storage.
02:48 - I could put that in the draw
loop, like, oh, I'm animating,
02:50 - I'm animating, just store,
store, store, store, store.
02:53 - And that might be OK
to do in some contexts.
02:55 - But I think here I
can basically choose
02:58 - to save the values
in local storage
03:00 - anytime I've used the slider
and the value has changed.
03:07 - So here I've added
the changed event,
03:09 - which executes
whenever I've completed
03:12 - a change for the slider.
03:13 - There is a different
event called
03:14 - input, which will
continuously fire as I'm
03:16 - moving the slider around.
03:17 - But I think I can wait
until I have completed
03:19 - my motion of the slider.
03:20 - Then, in the function, I'll
call the p5 storeItem function.
03:27 - StoreItem takes two arguments.
03:29 - I need a key-- a unique string
that names the piece of data
03:33 - I want to save.
03:34 - In this case, I'll
call it "red."
03:37 - So the key to unlock
the data is "red."
03:40 - And the data is just the
value of the rSlider.
03:44 - And let me just
add a console.log
03:47 - to make sure I see when
this event is happening.
03:52 - I'm going to move the
red slider, let go,
03:55 - and I see the 168 value.
03:57 - And it should be stored
in local storage now.
03:59 - Then the question is, when
do I want to load the data?
04:02 - And I've kind of
done this in a weird,
04:03 - backwards way because I want
to save the data while I'm
04:07 - operating the
sketch, but then I'm
04:08 - thinking about the future, when
I'm running it again, that I
04:11 - want to retrieve the data.
04:12 - So right there in setup, the
moment I create the slider,
04:15 - I should see if there is data
available already stored.
04:19 - Then I can set the
slider to the color value
04:21 - that I'm retrieving.
04:23 - GetItem is the p5 local storage
function to retrieve data.
04:29 - I'm very sorry to
overcomplicate this video,
04:32 - but there's this
new thing that's
04:33 - happening in the p5 Web Editor.
04:35 - When I type the word
"red" as a string,
04:37 - it'll actually create this
automatic color picker,
04:40 - which is kind of amazing.
04:41 - And it would allow me to do
so many wonderful things.
04:43 - But it's getting in
my way right now.
04:45 - So I'm going to change the
name of my key to "redValue."
04:51 - So now I'm retrieving
the red value.
04:53 - If it doesn't
exist, it will just
04:55 - give me the value null back.
04:58 - So as long as r is not
equal to null, then
05:02 - I can set the value of
that slider to whatever I
05:05 - retrieved from local storage.
05:07 - I'm going to click
Auto-refresh, which
05:09 - could add some wonkiness if
it's running and rerunning here.
05:11 - I'm going to run the sketch.
05:13 - I'm going to give myself
a little bit of red.
05:17 - I'm going to hit Stop.
05:19 - And I'm going to run it again.
05:20 - [TA-DA SOUND PLAYING]
05:21 - Oh, local storage, where
have you been all my life?
05:24 - All the data is locally stored
so it's not going anywhere.
05:28 - It's just right there in
your browser, and it works.
05:30 - Oh, I love it.
05:31 - Let's add the same thing
for green and blue.
05:44 - Let's see what we've got here.
05:45 - First, we create three sliders.
05:46 - Then we attempt
to retrieve three
05:49 - values from local storage--
05:50 - a redValue, a greenValue,
and a blueValue.
05:53 - If there's a red value,
set the red slider.
05:55 - If there's a green value,
set the green slider.
05:58 - OK, this one I forgot to update.
06:00 - If there's a blue value,
set the blue slider.
06:05 - And then make sure
that any time I
06:08 - change any of those
slider values,
06:11 - I store those three items.
06:14 - Now, technically, if I'm
only changing the red slider,
06:16 - do I need to store
the new green or blue?
06:18 - But it's easier just for
me to not worry about it
06:21 - and always store all
three anytime there's
06:23 - a change to any of them.
06:24 - Whoops.
06:25 - I have a little typo here.
06:27 - That needs to be a lowercase.
06:29 - Everything is case-sensitive.
06:31 - And now let's run this again.
06:33 - Well, we start with
that red value.
06:36 - Now let me add a little
green, add a little blue,
06:39 - take the green down, get rid
of all the red, more green,
06:43 - and stop.
06:46 - OK, everybody.
06:48 - It's the moment of truth.
06:49 - Let's run the sketch again.
06:51 - [DING]
06:52 - I love it!
06:53 - One of the things
that's really quite
06:55 - wonderful about local
storage is it saves the data
06:58 - beyond any given
session, meaning
07:01 - if I were to quit the browser--
07:03 - I'm going to do that right now--
07:05 - then relaunch the browser,
go to the p5 Web Editor,
07:09 - log in, go back to my sketch and
run it, I still have my data!
07:16 - Oh, it's amazing!
07:18 - Now if I were to open
up a different browser,
07:21 - go to an incognito window, maybe
open up this page on my phone,
07:25 - I wouldn't get these colors.
07:26 - It doesn't even matter if I'm
logged into the p5 Web Editor.
07:30 - I'm going to log out,
go to that sketch.
07:35 - And it's still pulling that.
07:36 - It has nothing to do with any
account or anything anywhere.
07:40 - It's just data that's being
stored in the browser itself
07:43 - that's running on this laptop.
07:44 - Now, it's really
up to the browser
07:46 - to choose how it
implements local storage.
07:48 - So it depends what browser
you're actually using.
07:50 - But in almost all cases, I would
imagine if you clear the cache
07:53 - or clear your browsing history
that local storage will also
07:56 - be cleared.
07:57 - If you want to dive a little
deeper and look at the data
07:59 - itself, you can look at your
browser's developer tools.
08:03 - Here in Chrome, I want to go to
Application and then right here
08:08 - under Storage, Local Storage.
08:10 - Now I can see the key and
value for all the data
08:13 - that I'm storing.
08:14 - Now, there's lots of
extra stuff there.
08:16 - One, the p5 Web Editor
makes use of local storage.
08:20 - Two, I've been playing
around with this earlier
08:22 - today so there's extra
stuff in local storage.
08:24 - It is unique to the domain.
08:26 - So I can only have one
redValue, greenValue,
08:31 - or blueValue for this
p5.js preview window, which
08:34 - is what I'm actually seeing in
the pane when the sketch runs.
08:37 - So, amazingly, if I were to
create a new sketch and call
08:41 - getItem redValue, I'd
still have that value.
08:44 - So if I'm using local storage
across multiple sketches
08:46 - and always staying
in the p5 Web Editor,
08:48 - I've got to be careful
about my naming.
08:50 - Now, to keep things simple, I
stored redValue, greenValue,
08:53 - and blueValue all
as separate items.
08:56 - But one of the nice
things about what p5 does
08:58 - is it allows you to pass
a JavaScript object.
09:01 - And it will turn that
into a string that
09:04 - can be saved in local storage
and then unpack it back
09:06 - for you as a JavaScript object.
09:08 - So I don't know how
you found this video,
09:10 - and JavaScript objects
might be new to you.
09:12 - I'll refer you to my tutorials
about classes and objects
09:15 - and those types of things.
09:16 - But if that's
familiar to you, let
09:18 - me show you how that
works with this example.
09:20 - So, for me, what I'd want to
do is create a new object.
09:23 - I'm going to call it "colors"
and give it three properties.
09:32 - And then, instead of
storing individual numbers,
09:34 - I can store that full object
associated with a single key.
09:38 - I'll just name the key
"colors" and save the colors.
09:43 - This will also allow me to
simplify these if statements
09:46 - because I don't need to check
each of them individually.
09:55 - So now I'm asking
for a JavaScript
09:57 - object called colors.
09:58 - If it is not null, I can pull
out the r, g, and b properties
10:02 - and assign it to
the correct slider.
10:04 - Let's run the sketch again.
10:05 - [BUZZ]
10:06 - Uh-oh.
10:07 - Unexpected end of input.
10:08 - Oh, I just forgot an
extra curly bracket here.
10:12 - So I don't have my
data from before
10:14 - because I renamed everything.
10:19 - But I can make this nice purple
color, hit Stop, run it again.
10:25 - And there we go.
10:26 - Thank you to atomfighter and
others in the Twitch chat
10:29 - that are following along
as I record this tutorial.
10:31 - There's this excellent post
on web.dev/storage-for-the-web
10:35 - about different kinds of storage
mechanisms-- session storage,
10:39 - cookies, the file system API.
10:41 - And I would encourage
you to investigate those.
10:44 - This is also where you will find
some of the downsides of using
10:47 - local storage.
10:48 - And in fact, it
even says it should
10:49 - be avoided because
it is synchronous,
10:51 - blocks the main
thread, is limited
10:53 - to only 5 megabytes of data.
10:55 - But these are
actually the reasons
10:57 - why I love local
storage, because it's
10:58 - a really quick and really easy
solution for having persistence
11:02 - without worrying about all
sorts of asynchronous extra code
11:05 - and data.
11:06 - So if you just want
proof of concept ability
11:08 - to store some simple numbers,
some simple data, some settings
11:12 - for your creative
coding application,
11:14 - then I can't
recommend it enough.
11:16 - I could keep going
with this example.
11:17 - What if I used that color
and drew in the canvas?
11:20 - And then, every time
you reloaded the page,
11:23 - you got elements of
your drawing back?
11:25 - What if it were to tell you how
many days in a row you drew?
11:29 - All of these things
are possible.
11:31 - I would love to hear from
you in the comments what
11:33 - is your scenario that you might
like to use local storage with.
11:36 - I'll include extra
examples linked
11:39 - from the video description that
will go along with this video.
11:41 - And if there's anything
that I really missed,
11:43 - I could do a follow-up video and
address it or come back to it
11:46 - on a future live stream.
11:47 - So thanks for watching.
11:48 - I hope this little extra p5
video helped you with your day
11:51 - and whatever you are coding.
11:52 - And I'll see you next
time on the Coding Train.
