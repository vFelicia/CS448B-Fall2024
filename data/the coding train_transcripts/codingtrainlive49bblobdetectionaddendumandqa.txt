00:00 - there's like this
00:14 - hello surprise like roaring noise I'm
00:18 - back I don't know if anybody's watching
00:19 - but I missed such as obvious and
00:23 - important bug from this morning this
00:33 - that I've come back to fix that bug so
00:37 - by the way this morning was coding
00:38 - rainbow episode number 49 which means
00:41 - this Thursday it's going to be episode
00:43 - 50 which means I've got to do something
00:45 - special for episode 50 so this is really
00:47 - like episode 49 point A I hope that I
00:53 - hope that this is working point 149 a 49
00:58 - and a half maybe this will just be I
01:00 - don't know if we'll edit this together
01:01 - this will just suddenly appear at the
01:03 - end of 49 Overbeck should be two
01:05 - different youtube videos who knows but
01:07 - I'm back I hope to actually have more
01:10 - time to do more stuff but I am only here
01:14 - just to do one thing I have to leave in
01:15 - about 15 or 20 minutes this is the nice
01:17 - thing go about having a video studio
01:19 - with the camera set up it just turn on
01:21 - in live stream whatever I want does
01:23 - everybody could see me I'm not seeing
01:24 - myself in my own preview so I'm just
01:28 - going to do a quick refresh of the page
01:30 - to see if I see myself but let me know
01:33 - in the chat if this is working for you
01:35 - and I see that Oliver writes all seems
01:39 - good so anyway I've got to go find the
01:44 - example from this morning try now
01:47 - opening up processing
01:53 - this dog this doc okay frosting is open
01:58 - I processing is open come back
02:01 - processing and go to open recent blog
02:05 - tracking too okay so if you recall I had
02:10 - made an improvement here it works I
02:18 - don't know why I can't see myself in the
02:21 - preview but I'm just gonna have to trust
02:23 - that you guys are seeing me if it ever
02:26 - stopped working please tell me that it
02:30 - stopped okay so what do I want to do
02:33 - here this is my blog tracking we have
02:36 - this threshold where they become one
02:38 - blob or separate blobs it's working very
02:40 - nicely okay so what I want to do is ok
02:48 - so i made the blob tracking tutorial
02:51 - video this will not be a new tutorial
02:53 - video this will just be alike hey I'm
02:56 - back let me show you one more thing so
02:59 - and what I'm going to do is go back and
03:02 - make the actual section uh where I add
03:12 - all the points of the blob and then find
03:14 - the shortest distance again even though
03:17 - that's not entirely necessary I've got
03:19 - to do that anyway okay so because I when
03:22 - I had done wrong was I never added the
03:25 - first point otherwise of course it would
03:26 - work okay here we go I'm ready
03:34 - this stop this dock is done if you get
03:37 - this this stop this stop this done and
03:40 - there's eating this stuff is stuck
03:41 - underneath this dis stop not loading it
03:45 - all for me well some people are saying
03:48 - it's working some people are saying it's
03:49 - not I don't know what you do about that
03:58 - okay uh here we go let me minimize this
04:03 - bring this over here and time to do my
04:07 - addenda addendum okay people were saying
04:11 - it works all right well this is being
04:13 - recorded two discs anyway so even if
04:15 - this live stream stopped working i will
04:17 - have this video saved ok back for a
04:21 - quick addendum i had tried to remember
04:23 - to make it work where you find the
04:25 - shortest distance to any pixel it's part
04:27 - of the blob and that didn't work well i
04:29 - had made a silly error of course the
04:31 - internets saved me from my own failings
04:35 - and so i'm going to quickly add this
04:36 - back in and so what I'm going to do is
04:38 - I'm going to make an ArrayList of P
04:40 - vectors called points boy I didn't I
04:42 - already have this i'm going to say
04:44 - points is a new arraylist of P vector
04:50 - objects uh okay and then and then what
05:00 - did i do every time there's a new point
05:01 - i would say points dot add new P vector
05:06 - X comma Y whoops don't don't don't and
05:11 - then in a show what I also want to do is
05:16 - say for int I equals 0 I is less than oh
05:19 - no no no no no no no no I can use my P
05:22 - vector look at all of the peeve actors
05:24 - and just say make it blue and then type
05:30 - in a point to do did the VX meet out why
05:41 - there it is and
05:46 - I don't know what is going on whether
05:49 - things are working or not working so we
05:53 - can see here now that I'm seeing all the
05:57 - points that are part of the blob in
05:58 - addition to that bounding rectangle okay
06:00 - so one way that I could do to find
06:03 - multiple blobs right instead of and I
06:08 - could instead of simply finding that
06:11 - bounding rectangle I can now find the
06:13 - shortest point to any point ah but what
06:15 - was the mistake that I made here was the
06:17 - mistake that I made look in the add
06:20 - function every time there's a new point
06:22 - i added to that list but guess what i
06:24 - forgot when I first make the blob I make
06:27 - it I make it with an XY so what I forgot
06:31 - was to say points add new P vector X
06:35 - comma Y so now I should be able to go
06:39 - back and add that code so I'm going to
06:42 - comment this out which is an excellent
06:44 - method and I'm going to do another
06:45 - method which says that a d is I'm going
06:51 - to start it with like a really high
06:52 - distance and then I'm going to look
06:54 - through all of the vectors and I'm going
07:02 - to do the temporary distance is the
07:06 - distance between that X distance square
07:09 - between that x and y and the vac that
07:13 - particular point and then if that
07:18 - temporary distance is less than the
07:20 - distance then distance equals that
07:24 - temporary distance so this distance this
07:26 - D is like a record I want to find the
07:29 - shortest distance between the new point
07:31 - and any point that's inside the blob and
07:34 - if it's less than the threshold go right
07:38 - ahead so now I'm going to run this and
07:44 - this should actually work if it does so
07:48 - it works and it's perfectly fast I so
07:51 - the only reason it wasn't working before
07:52 - and you can see how this threshold that
07:55 - distance threshold works beautifully as
07:57 - well write it
07:59 - is the blobs when they're in within a
08:01 - certain threshold and I can change that
08:03 - right by making it higher so what's high
08:09 - are gonna do I should make it lower
08:13 - right oh I I really should change this
08:19 - so that it okay so it changed us make
08:22 - this lower I should just have it change
08:24 - by five or something okay and so now we
08:29 - can see here there's their separate
08:31 - blobs until they get quite quite close
08:34 - let me just change that right now
08:36 - because this is driving me crazy I want
08:39 - to change here I whenever I press the
08:41 - key to change those threshold values I
08:43 - want to change it by like five so that I
08:50 - don't have to so that I don't have to be
08:58 - pressing it so many times so here they
09:02 - are right here are two blobs and you can
09:06 - see them whoops till the color threshold
09:09 - now distance threshold they're separate
09:12 - blobs right when that distance threshold
09:14 - is five we get lots of extra little
09:17 - blobs they really don't become the same
09:19 - blob until they're literally touching
09:20 - each other but if that distance
09:23 - threshold is more like 60 then when
09:27 - they're within 60 pixels they become so
09:29 - this is another way of doing it that's
09:30 - perhaps a little bit more accurate than
09:33 - the other way but it works okay so I
09:35 - fixed that problem thank you very much I
09:37 - did both now this video now contains
09:40 - both solutions one solution being the
09:43 - clamping to a rectangle right finding
09:45 - the distance of the new point to the
09:47 - edges of the blob versus another just
09:50 - finding the shortest the shortest
09:51 - distance of the point to the rectangle
09:53 - itself the shorts to disappoint to any
09:55 - points within the rectangle okay that's
09:57 - the end of this video now for sure until
09:59 - I record another addendum goodbye okay
10:04 - so interestingly enough Thomas is saying
10:09 - it's not working it's also not working
10:11 - for me I cannot watch
10:13 - own stream let's see if I do it over
10:15 - here let's go to Schiffman live chip
10:26 - inception this is what's happening to me
10:33 - is this so i don't know why the stream
10:36 - isn't working for some people but it is
10:37 - working for other people you can see
10:39 - that it's not working for me i relieved
10:40 - i want the moment where I appear behind
10:42 - myself uh okay um so let me see if I
10:49 - have any actual questions in the chat I
10:51 - see some not actual questions through
10:53 - the chat anybody have any so that was
10:59 - just really what I came home to record
11:01 - if I have a little bit more time does
11:06 - anyone have any other questions they
11:08 - would like to ask
11:20 - let's play some music we can do let's do
11:24 - a um let's do some green screen footage
11:44 - you put a coating challenge you don't
11:47 - want me to just be doing my dancing in
11:48 - front of a green screen
12:17 - I'm waiting for questions to appear but
12:19 - they're not coming
12:27 - when are the rainbows going to appear
12:29 - that's what I want to know yeah creepy
12:33 - is right sorry I'm sorry ah I think I'm
12:42 - overdoing it but no no way well nobody's
12:47 - watching this there's 40 people watching
12:50 - this yeah I'm also losing it do I know
12:57 - c++ I do know c++ but I haven't used it
13:00 - for a while let's see here if I think
13:04 - that's really all I came I guess this
13:05 - idea of wait look hold on a sec there's
13:12 - me now it's working for me because
13:16 - there's me with the previously not
13:19 - working video but it is not working
13:22 - again put your co2 calculator in 10
13:27 - minutes could I make a quick thumbnail
13:30 - with the new correction yes yes thank
13:32 - you so hold on I have to do something
13:40 - very important this will be a thumbnail
13:43 - for the video
13:48 - oh wait this is a good one to accept uh
13:54 - except i think i want my distance
13:56 - threshold to be less i'll give me this
14:04 - is better
14:12 - move my mouse okay good point the color
14:20 - threshold isn't really working very well
14:22 - when we hold on it does run kind of slow
14:26 - when there's a lot of points
14:39 - oh wait oh yeah okay okay sorry okay
14:47 - everyone i I don't know this is it for
14:50 - today I will be back on Thursday let's
14:53 - check actually let me just take five
15:00 - minutes to answer let's do another Q&A
15:02 - because this is actually a question
15:04 - that's not in this is a question that's
15:08 - in this in my slack channel I feel like
15:13 - I can't underwear is it we find it under
15:17 - share work no okay okay i'm going to do
15:27 - a quick
15:45 - ok
15:46 - I'm going to do a quick oh and I want to
15:49 - bring up something inside p 5 videos
15:56 - looking inside p 5 okay okay okay
16:12 - okay here we go here we go uh I lost my
16:20 - chat okay hello and welcome to another
16:24 - QA the question for today's Q&A comes
16:29 - from Michelle and Michelle rights on
16:31 - helping with p5 development i'm still
16:33 - beginner but is there a way i can
16:36 - contribute to it i was thinking about
16:38 - contributing to the inline examples that
16:40 - might be away are there certain examples
16:41 - which are good wants to keep in mind as
16:44 - a reference so this is I have important
16:49 - text messages but I don't need to look
16:52 - at in the real this video ah somebody
16:54 - edit that out so um you want to do some
16:57 - uh I'm start over cuz i really should
17:01 - not have looked at the text message I
17:03 - underserved from the back beginning okay
17:10 - hello and what hello and welcome to
17:14 - another Q&A video today's question comes
17:17 - from Michelle Michelle right um help I'm
17:20 - helping with p5 development I'm still a
17:22 - beginner but I I want to know about
17:24 - rephrasing her question I'm just going
17:26 - to read it last try hello and welcome to
17:34 - another Q and a creative coding video in
17:38 - this video I'm going to answer a
17:39 - question from Michelle Michelle rights
17:41 - on helping with p5 development i'm still
17:44 - beginner e but is there a way i can
17:46 - contribute to it i was thinking about
17:48 - contributing to the inline examples
17:49 - might be away a via this page and
17:51 - there's a link to a particular page that
17:53 - i'll show you in a minute are there
17:54 - certain examples which might be a good
17:55 - one to keep in mind as a reference okay
17:57 - so you're asking the question let's say
18:00 - the michelle has asked the question I'm
18:02 - going to generalize question a bit more
18:03 - i like p 5 i'm interested in it how can
18:06 - i contribute so the first thing i want
18:08 - to say is that there is a wonderful set
18:11 - of video tutorials that are being
18:13 - created by louisa Pereira and they are
18:16 - called looking inside p5 and you can see
18:19 - there's part 1 and there's also a part 2
18:20 - she also has both of these tutorials in
18:23 - Spanish so they're both in English and
18:25 - now I would play for you right now but
18:27 - you can go the links will be in this
18:28 - video's description and you can go and
18:30 - watch them on your own but what's
18:31 - wonderful about these video tutorials is
18:33 - they kind of explain to you this is
18:35 - let's say you want to contribute to p5
18:36 - guess this is where you will land this
18:39 - is the github repository page 4 p-5 Jess
18:42 - github.com / processing / p5 Jess
18:45 - there's all this stuff there's a source
18:48 - folder and a Lib folder in a docs folder
18:50 - in this bill task and test how is this
18:52 - organized how does it all work louisa
18:54 - does a wonderful job of going through
18:56 - all of these things in her tutorial
18:58 - videos so rather than do that here i'm
19:01 - going to refer you to those particular
19:02 - video so what I'm going to do here is
19:03 - show you a bit about how you might other
19:06 - places and how you might sort of get
19:08 - involved so one thing is is on the first
19:12 - thing that you can do is just kind of go
19:14 - and look at some of the wiki pages so
19:16 - here um they might look through there's
19:19 - some tutorials and different things but
19:21 - they're one thing that I would look at
19:22 - here first is this development wiki so
19:25 - this development wiki gives you a nice
19:28 - kind of set on ideas and things about
19:31 - what you can do in order to get started
19:33 - getting contributing so you can look
19:35 - through the github issues there's links
19:37 - to that here you could think about
19:39 - implementing a new feature there's lots
19:41 - of stuff here there's instructions of
19:44 - what you need to do to set up and
19:45 - download it some of this stuff might
19:47 - look a little bit intimidating or a
19:48 - little bit scary but p5 jess is a
19:51 - friendly and open place it doesn't
19:53 - matter what your skill level is we want
19:54 - you to contribute we want you to help so
19:56 - come and give it a try and see where you
19:58 - get stuck send me a tweet post on the
20:01 - processing forums there's various place
20:03 - where you can where you can get help i
20:05 - also have a bunch of video tutorials
20:06 - about github that you could take a look
20:08 - at now michelle had asked michelle i
20:11 - pointed out this particular this
20:13 - particular wiki page which was called
20:15 - the development checklist and the
20:17 - development checklist is kind of a
20:19 - checklist oh I wish I had looked at this
20:20 - for my WebGL video earlier but you can
20:23 - sort of see here a bunch of things that
20:25 - are kind of in progress or being
20:27 - developed that you can think about
20:28 - contributing to and one of the things
20:30 - that you can look at that she had
20:34 - noticed here that the
20:37 - okay I'm going to find it more quickly
20:39 - is the inline in line exam okay we hold
20:46 - on what am I looking at here sorry
20:48 - reference sketches sorry so these are
20:51 - sketches and things that are for the
20:53 - reference now you can see that some of
20:55 - them are not crossed out meaning they
20:58 - haven't been done yet id class so let's
21:01 - look at how that works and i'll show you
21:03 - a little bit about how you might do this
21:04 - so oh these aren't links so let's say
21:08 - you want to create something for the the
21:14 - ID function in p5 Dom how would you do
21:17 - that so let's go and i'm going to show
21:21 - you actually i'm going to go to p5 jas
21:24 - i'm going to go here to source and
21:27 - actually i just realized this is all the
21:29 - source for all the stuff that's in the
21:31 - p5 just library itself and all gets
21:34 - compiled together into that big p5 jess
21:36 - library but the p5 dom function the p5
21:40 - Don library is actually different and
21:42 - it's right here in lib Adams add-ons p5
21:45 - Dom gas so you can see here is actually
21:48 - all of the source code 4 p-5 Dom j/s now
21:53 - I what I want to do is go back to that
21:55 - development checklist it's not showing
21:58 - up if I there we go that's what I wanted
22:02 - to show up and let's look back under DOM
22:06 - and we can see that for example a
22:09 - position is implemented so right here we
22:12 - can see that position is implemented so
22:13 - I'm going to look for the position
22:14 - function so I can see actually this is
22:21 - the source code for the position
22:24 - function in p5 dot so what position does
22:27 - is it takes a Dom element and gives it
22:29 - an absolute position on the page I don't
22:32 - have my not looking at my chat and I'm
22:34 - worried that something's not working ok
22:36 - so um now here's the source code for it
22:40 - but up here is a quick little example
22:43 - create a canvas and call canvassed
22:45 - opposition and look how this is
22:47 - formatted it's formatted at example
22:50 - with a div with code class equals no
22:53 - render because the code isnt rendered or
22:55 - maybe it should be rendered I don't know
22:57 - and then a closed code tag close div tag
23:01 - so I'm going to go here and I'm just
23:03 - going to copy paste this pause point to
23:09 - editing the video so now what I'm going
23:20 - to do oh we're sorry I'm going to come
23:24 - back so now what I'm going to do is I'm
23:28 - let's look for the ID function so I'm
23:31 - going to look for ID equals equals
23:35 - function I got to find it oh you know
23:45 - why it's not here tricky tricky tricky
23:51 - hold on pause oh no p 5 element
24:01 - why are some here and some aren't here
24:05 - that's interesting oh no it's here it's
24:09 - got to be here that's weird okay hold on
24:17 - I'm having trouble finding this function
24:21 - so that this is going to have to get
24:23 - edited me searching edited out
24:36 - well done
24:42 - there it is oh it's in p5 so that's
24:44 - interesting some of the functions in p5
24:51 - Dom I went off on a tangent here I don't
24:55 - know if this is going to be useful well
24:58 - I'll just keep my tangent i don't know
25:00 - if i should make this a QA answer yeah
25:03 - I'm gonna okay I'm gonna go back to
25:06 - where of us and now I know where it is
25:10 - back I couldn't find the function that I
25:13 - want to edit here in p5 Dom bjs and
25:16 - actually what I didn't realize is the
25:19 - function ID is a function that assigns a
25:22 - specific ID to a Dom element and it's
25:24 - not actually in the p5 DOM is function
25:28 - I'm sorry add on it because it comes
25:31 - with core p5 it's actually part of Corps
25:34 - p5 and for that I need to go to source
25:37 - and then I'm looking for p5 a core p 5
25:43 - element jes and here it is so I want to
25:47 - look for ID equals whoops ID equals and
25:51 - now here's that function and you'll
25:53 - notice that function does not have an
25:55 - example so let's just do this right now
25:57 - we're going to live on youtube on the
26:00 - air make an example in submit a pull
26:02 - request am i logged into i'm logged in
26:06 - as Schiffman that's going to be a bit of
26:07 - a problem that's fine so I'm going to
26:10 - hit edit because I have privileges to
26:15 - make changes so I have to make sure so
26:16 - now I want to look for ID equals and I'm
26:21 - going to go right here and I'm going to
26:22 - paste that in oh I lost it so hold on I
26:27 - got a I got to get back to lib addons p5
26:33 - dumb and I'm going to search for what
26:38 - was one that we liked position position
26:44 - here it is I got to get this example
26:47 - stuff right here I'm going to go back
26:49 - here and now i'm going to zoom in here
26:51 - so you can see what i'm doing i'm going
26:53 - to paste this in here ooh so i need to
26:55 - fix this
26:56 - that the spacing is right you know I
26:58 - could be more thoughtful about this
27:09 - and then I need to make sure this is
27:11 - closed so now you can see I've added the
27:15 - code for an example but this is the code
27:16 - for the position so what I want to do is
27:19 - do make given an ID I'll make that ID my
27:25 - canvas and then what this does is
27:28 - already come assigns a CSS selector ID
27:34 - to the canvas element so I don't know if
27:40 - anybody so this is now adding a quick
27:43 - little example that shows you how you
27:44 - can use the ID function and then oh this
27:49 - German going on in the chat now and then
27:53 - I'm going to go down to the bottom and I
27:55 - want to create a new branch and start a
27:58 - pull request so adding in line example
28:03 - for ID function I'm gonna write I'm live
28:06 - on YouTube demonstrating how to make a
28:11 - pull request and add an inline in line
28:17 - example so once i do that i'm going to
28:22 - click proposed file change and there's
28:28 - some guidelines for contributing that i
28:29 - could click at and i want to see and i'm
28:33 - going to create this this you can see my
28:36 - change is just in this one p 5 element
28:39 - it adds just this code and i'm going to
28:41 - say create pull request and it's going
28:45 - to do some checks to make sure things
28:47 - are okay and we'll see and on Thursday
28:49 - this Thursday is coding rainbow the
28:52 - there will be a mystery will discover
28:55 - was this pull request merged or was it
28:58 - not merged stay tuned to be continued oh
29:01 - I need a sound effect for dun dun dun is
29:07 - that uh okay I won't look for that right
29:09 - now ok so again I kind of went off in a
29:12 - little bit of tangent of showing you a
29:13 - very specific thing but basically what
29:16 - you the p5 as an environment is designed
29:21 - to be both something they could
29:22 - beginners can use to learn to program
29:23 - and also can learn to contribute to an
29:25 - open source environment and the place to
29:28 - do that first is github the problem with
