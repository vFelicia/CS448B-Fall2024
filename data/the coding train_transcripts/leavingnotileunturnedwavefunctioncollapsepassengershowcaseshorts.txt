00:00 - let's get to the good stuff all aboard
00:02 - the coding train passenger showcase a
00:04 - great place for you to start is Kathy
00:06 - mcginnis's submission Kathy's included a
00:08 - set of Sliders which allows you to
00:09 - adjust the color palette of the tile as
00:12 - well as a whole range of other designs
00:13 - she's made with wave function collapse
00:15 - check out this version from Jin kuk cha
00:18 - which treats each tile as a single Pixel
00:21 - when a cell collapses to a particular
00:23 - color it propagates out to the
00:25 - neighboring cells to recalculate a new
00:28 - color range with a similar color grid
00:30 - kit designed their own tile system to
00:32 - create an abstract ornamental pattern I
00:34 - really love to see project documentation
00:36 - like this with an explanation of the
00:38 - optimizations performed to strike native
00:40 - version in Python my favorite perhaps is
00:42 - the version that generates a mondrion
00:44 - style painting if you're looking for an
00:46 - example in 3D check out gabra's pretty
00:49 - bad North it's a pretty good north thank
00:53 - you for sharing these beautiful
00:54 - generative artworks next time I'm going
00:56 - to look at the prime spiral challenge
00:58 - it's only one minute
