00:00 - - Hello and welcome to a special episode
00:02 - of The Coding Train.
00:04 - What are you are about to
watch is an edited version
00:06 - of a livestream that
happened a couple weeks ago
00:07 - with a guest, wonderful
guest, Stefania Druga.
00:09 - If you want to watch the
full livestream archive,
00:11 - you can find that link
in the video description.
00:14 - Stefania came and presented
on her work on Cognimates.
00:18 - Stefania is a recent
graduate of the MIT media lab
00:20 - and she is the creator
of Cognimates which is
00:23 - an open source educational
platform for AI.
00:26 - So while her project is
something that's well suited
00:29 - for kids, this video is
really more an explanation
00:31 - about the project that I would
imagine that maybe parents
00:35 - or teachers, educators,
caregivers that work
00:38 - with children ages 7 to
10 might be interested in.
00:41 - So, Stefania's work is wonderful,
00:44 - I hope that you learn something new
00:45 - and find it interesting and
if you want to learn more
00:48 - about the project, all of the things
00:49 - that she talks about are linked
in this video's description.
00:51 - So thank you, Stefania, for being here
00:53 - and thank you for watching.
00:56 - (ding)
00:57 - - Thank you so much for
the kind introduction.
00:58 - I'm actually amazed because Dan pronounced
01:01 - my name correctly, never happens.
01:03 - I'm Stefania, nice to meet you all.
01:06 - I am just graduated from MIT Media Lab
01:09 - and during two years
there, I've been working
01:12 - on this project called
Cognimates which is like
01:15 - a playmate and a learning mate
01:18 - and the goal of this platform
which is open source,
01:20 - by the way, is to teach AI to kids
01:24 - and allow kids to customize
train their own AI models
01:29 - and teach program smart
devices they have in the home
01:33 - and learn more about this technology.
01:35 - So the overall mission
and goal of this project
01:38 - is really to democratize
who gets to create with AI
01:40 - and if you're going to ask
me why are you doing this
01:44 - and it's kind of crazy to
teach, AI is complicated,
01:48 - machine learning is complicated,
01:49 - why should we teach it to kids?
01:51 - And I'm going to say that
it is necessary because for
01:55 - the first time, we have a
generation that is growing up
01:57 - with this technology, just like I grew up
01:59 - with internet in my small
town in Transylvania
02:02 - and we have more than
47 million smart devices
02:06 - in homes right now that
kids are talking to
02:08 - and when I started my
work at my media lab,
02:12 - we did a lot of research
to actually understand
02:15 - how do kids perceive these devices?
02:17 - Do they trust them?
02:18 - Do they want to learn from them?
02:21 - Do they want to program them?
02:23 - And we published a lot of this research
02:25 - and then we figured out that
actually a lot of the kids
02:28 - thought these devices, like Alexa,
02:31 - or I don't know, Google
Home, are more intelligent
02:35 - than they are so we were like
what if we give them tools
02:38 - to actually show them how they work
02:41 - and in that process, they
would learn how to demystify
02:46 - a little bit what artificial
intelligence means
02:48 - and how smart are really these smart toys.
02:51 - So we built this platform Cognimates,
02:54 - which is available online,
that's the link, cognimates.me.
02:58 - It's research projects, some
of the things I discovered
03:02 - while preparing the demo today don't work
03:04 - but some of the things do
work and it's open source
03:06 - so you can help me fix it.
03:08 - It has, it's building on
scratch which was developed
03:12 - at MIT Media Lab as well
and it's open source
03:16 - but we created an entire
series of extensions
03:19 - specifically for AI education.
03:21 - So when you load, when
you go to Cognimates,
03:25 - the cognimates.me, you're
going to see this website,
03:28 - let me make it a little bit bigger
03:31 - and then if you actually
want to start programming
03:34 - straight away and trying it,
03:35 - you can click on this launch Cognimates
03:37 - which will take you to the code lab.
03:39 - And in the code lab, on this plus button,
03:43 - you can kind of see what are some of
03:44 - the extensions we created.
03:45 - So anything from programming your Alexa,
03:49 - if you have one at home,
to actually play with
03:53 - the camera your computer or tablet has
03:56 - to do color detection or just
program a robot like Cosmo,
04:00 - if you have one, we wanted
to provide extensions
04:04 - that are a lot of fun for kids
and usually kids love Lego
04:07 - and we can do, Lego we do
as well, but we also wanted
04:11 - to allow kids that don't
have access to an Alexa
04:16 - or a Cosmo or a JIBO to be able
04:19 - to learn these skills as well.
04:20 - So some of these extensions
are just web based
04:24 - and others are also for
IoT and robotic platforms.
04:28 - So before talking too much about this,
04:31 - I can show you what are some of the things
04:33 - that we can do and on our website, we have
04:38 - collection of projects.
04:40 - I'm going to start with the first one
04:42 - which is called Make Me
Happy and in this project,
04:47 - if you click on it, you can download it,
04:51 - download the starter
project and then go to
04:55 - the code lab and upload it, file, upload,
05:00 - and then let's see where did I put it,
05:05 - and in here,
05:07 - you will see what are all
the elements of this platform
05:10 - which as I mentioned
is building on Scratch.
05:13 - So on the left side, you see what are all
05:17 - the blocks that we can use, oh yeah,
05:19 - I forgot to say that (laughs),
05:23 - the way we do coding and
the way this platform works
05:26 - is by using this blocks which
is like visual programming
05:32 - language, it's called, and
it all builds on Blockly,
05:36 - open source grammar from Google,
05:39 - and it's very similar to
Lego so just the way we plug
05:41 - and play with Lego, we can
plug and play with this blocks.
05:45 - So the idea for the blocks is that
05:47 - you don't necessarily
need to know the syntax
05:51 - of a programming language
like JavaScript or Python
05:54 - but you can just read what's
on the text of the block
05:58 - and start to create your program in here.
06:00 - This is called the stage
06:04 - in the middle and then you can start
06:07 - to put them together and when they,
06:09 - it's actually very satisfying,
06:11 - when you put two blocks
together, you get a sound,
06:15 - I don't know if you can hear
it, yeah, you get that beep.
06:19 - So on my left side, I have
all these different blocks,
06:24 - I have a library of different
blocks that allow me
06:27 - to control my program.
06:29 - In the movie, I'm like the movie director,
06:31 - I put these blocks
together and I can start
06:35 - to create a story or
a game or an animation
06:37 - and on the right side, I have this output
06:43 - where right now, you can
see me and a character.
06:46 - I don't know why that's the
case but we'll figure it out.
06:49 - I think we added too many extensions.
06:52 - So right now, what we are going to do
06:54 - is basically go through
the steps of this project
06:58 - and I'm going to show it to you
just the way I do with kids.
07:02 - So we have this character which is Nary
07:06 - and Nary is going to react
to messages we're telling it.
07:12 - So if we're telling Nary,
we're going to start
07:15 - with something very, very simple.
07:18 - So, Dan, what should we
tell Nary to make her happy?
07:22 - Give me a phrase.
07:25 - - [Dan] Would you like something to eat?
07:27 - - Okay.
07:28 - Would you like something to eat?
07:33 - So, right now, we're going to
07:38 - go when we click
07:39 - the green flag, we're going
to have Nary be thinking
07:43 - because she doesn't really know
what we're going to say first
07:46 - and then we have a block
where she's asking us
07:48 - to tell her something and
my answer, I'm typing here,
07:53 - is going to be, would you
07:57 - like something to eat?
08:02 - It's very thoughtful.
08:04 - - [Dan] I guess I
answered with a question.
08:06 - - Yeah, no, it's very
thoughtful, we could do it like
08:08 - an entire chat bot and
then let's see what happens
08:09 - when I click enter.
08:12 - She should be happy and she is happy.
08:15 - Also if you want to have just interaction,
08:18 - we can make this bigger and do it again
08:22 - but, you know, this kind
of program only works
08:24 - if we say that specific phrase, right,
08:26 - would you like something to eat.
08:29 - - [Dan] The chat's pointing out a typo.
08:30 - It says something to it instead of eat.
08:33 - - Oh yes, thank you.
08:34 - Eat.
08:35 - I ate the letters because (laughs).
08:39 - I would like some letters to eat.
08:40 - Yeah, so this is very
limited in terms of how much
08:45 - we can interact with Nary.
08:47 - What if we want to tell her all sorts
08:49 - of different things and make
her react happy based on that?
08:53 - So for that we actually made
08:54 - this other extension called feelings.
08:58 - We used to call it sentiment
and then we realized
09:00 - that kids don't know what sentiment is
09:03 - but they know what feelings
are so that was interesting.
09:05 - So we have this feeling
extension and in here,
09:10 - there is a block that it's
saying what is the feeling
09:13 - of the text so in here,
I could just try it out,
09:18 - let's see how this block works.
09:20 - So if I would copy paste the
example we just had in here.
09:25 - What do we think, do we think
this is going to be positive
09:28 - or negative or neutral, what
do people in the chat think?
09:32 - Most people are saying positive now.
09:34 - - Positive.
09:35 - - [Dan] Couple neutrals, only
one negative am I seeing.
09:38 - And it looks like this
is not a scientific poll
09:40 - but it looks like the most
comments I'm seeing is positive.
09:42 - - Okay so let's try it,
do you have a guess?
09:47 - Do you think it's positive,
negative or neutral?
09:50 - - [Dan] I'm going to guess neutral.
09:51 - - Neutral, I'm going to guess
neutral true but let's see.
09:54 - It's positive, oh my god, that means
09:57 - our library doesn't work very well.
10:00 - No but it is, this is
what we do with kids,
10:03 - is like what do you
think made it positive?
10:05 - What word and how can
we probe that, right?
10:08 - So, we see now that this
block can actually pick up
10:13 - sentiment of phrases
we're typing or saying
10:15 - so in my program, going
back, if I want Nary to react
10:20 - all sorts of things, all sorts of messages
10:22 - I'm going to give her,
we can just go in here
10:26 - and instead of saying I
want to see if the answer
10:29 - is a specific phrase, I'm
just going to always check
10:34 - what's the feeling of the
different answers we're getting
10:37 - and if that feeling is positive,
10:42 - then I'm going to make Nary
happy and if it's negative,
10:44 - I'm going to make her sad.
10:46 - And you know, this kind of conditional,
10:48 - all of this blocks we're using here,
10:50 - it's already a bit complicated
so sometimes when I start
10:54 - with kids, I don't even
start with this, I just,
10:57 - we have this block that is called a hat.
10:59 - Oh yeah I forgot to tell
you that all of these blocks
11:02 - have names based on their functionality
11:05 - so this conditional I just
used, this is called pants
11:10 - because it has, it looks like pants
11:12 - and then this other block
here is called a hat
11:15 - because that can trigger an entire action.
11:17 - So I could do this in many different ways,
11:20 - everything with code, we can
do it in many different ways.
11:22 - So I could be when text is
positive, just make Nary happy
11:26 - and when text is negative, make Nary sad
11:30 - or I could do it with a conditional
and the other cool thing
11:33 - with these blocks is
that it's very, very fast
11:37 - to remake so I can just
duplicate that entire collection
11:42 - of blocks, let me just
make it a bit smaller
11:46 - so you can see, so like this,
11:50 - I can make Nary react when it's positive.
11:54 - Oh I already have an else but
I could also like right now,
11:58 - we're only dealing with
positive and negative,
12:00 - we don't have anything with neutral.
12:02 - So in that case, we can say
if the answer is neutral,
12:09 - then Nary should say something
like, oh I'm still thinking
12:13 - or we would make her still be thinking
12:15 - and I don't need an else here,
I can just do a simple if.
12:20 - We'll start from the beginning,
click the green flag,
12:23 - and we can say to Nary anything.
12:27 - So, do you want to give me a positive
12:31 - or negative or neutral?
12:33 - - [Dan] Um, all aboard.
12:35 - - All aboard.
12:36 - - [Dan] I didn't actually unmute
my microphone to say that.
12:38 - Well they probably can hear
me through your microphone
12:39 - but all aboard was what I said.
12:41 - - Okay, so let's see how she reacts.
12:43 - All aboard.
12:47 - And that should, yeah,
12:49 - so that was neutral and now,
12:51 - I want to try something positive.
12:56 - The Coding Train
12:59 - is fun.
13:02 - Let's see.
13:07 - Yay and she's happy.
13:08 - So we don't have these
things, I just want to show
13:12 - a very quick, simple
example but as you can see,
13:16 - it's much more fun if we do it together.
13:18 - So because I want you
guys to give messages
13:22 - to Nary, what we're going to
do now, and this is like where
13:25 - the modularity of extensions
and doing this inter-platform
13:30 - connecting everything makes a lot of sense
13:34 - and it allows us to play
with many different parts
13:36 - of the web and the physical world.
13:38 - So what we're going to do
now is we're going to add
13:40 - another extension so instead
of me giving Nary examples,
13:45 - I'm going to ask you guys to do that.
13:47 - So for that, we're going
to use another extensions
13:49 - we built which is the Twitter extension.
13:51 - So instead of me typing
here and doing typos,
13:55 - I'm going to let you do typos, no,
13:58 - if you tweet to The Coding Train,
14:03 - train, we are going to analyze
the feelings of your tweet
14:07 - and based on that, make Nary react.
14:10 - So I'm just going to add that in here
14:13 - so instead of asking a question,
14:18 - we're just going to
14:21 - put the tweets you guys are sending
14:25 - and actually because we want
to see what the tweets are,
14:28 - I'm also going to make her say the tweets
14:31 - so we see them on the screen.
14:34 - So I hope people are
going to start tweeting
14:36 - with The Coding Train
14:39 - and yeah, let's give it a try.
14:42 - - [Dan] So to be clear, they
should tweet @thecodingtrain
14:45 - or just the hashtag #codingtrain.
14:46 - - We could do both.
- Both, okay.
14:49 - - But for now, I did it with the...
14:51 - - [Dan] 'Cause I'll do one for at least.
14:53 - - Yeah.
(laughing)
14:54 - I did one with @thecodingtrain.
14:56 - - [Dan] Okay, okay.
14:57 - - We can also do a hashtag
Cognimates afterwards
15:01 - or The Coding Train.
15:03 - - [Dan] Okay, I sent one.
15:04 - People, again, people, they're
about 30 seconds behind
15:08 - so stuff...
- Okay.
15:09 - So let's try it.
15:11 - Let me make her say
that's, so we can give her
15:15 - a personality so if it's
neutral, she can say okay,
15:21 - I like that (giggles).
15:26 - And then if she's happy,
she can say that's
15:31 - awesome.
15:35 - And...
15:38 - If it's sad, it's like oh no.
15:44 - Tell me something else,
15:48 - all right,
15:49 - I think it's only getting the
ones from The Coding Train
15:52 - so let's do the hashtag, that's my bad.
15:56 - Sorry, guys.
(laughing)
15:59 - If you can use the same tweet you had
16:02 - but use a hashtag instead of @
16:06 - so we're going to try
that instead and oh yeah,
16:10 - this works, so actually if I just change
16:14 - the @ with the hashtag,
16:20 - it should be seeing the tweets
16:21 - that you guys have sent
so let's give it a try.
16:27 - Tell me something.
16:29 - Ooh, do you guys see what happened?
16:32 - It was so fast that we
couldn't see it so we need
16:34 - to add a wait time so we can actually read
16:37 - what you guys have tweeted.
16:41 - Tell me seomthing.
16:45 - TGIF, thank, oh she
likes that, she's happy.
16:48 - Okay.
16:51 - We, are we getting a new one, let's see.
16:54 - Choo, choo, choo, Cognimates rocks.
16:56 - (laughs) I like that.
16:58 - People are too nice, we
only have positive examples.
17:00 - Thank you playing along.
17:02 - So this is kind of like how it works.
17:05 - You saw we started with five blocks
17:08 - and then initially just
kind of give an example
17:13 - and make the character
react with specific phrase
17:16 - we said, like what would you like to eat
17:19 - and then we wanted to create
a more natural interaction,
17:22 - like talk to Nary the way
you would talk with a friend.
17:25 - So for that, we used
the feelings extension
17:28 - so we can analyze the
feelings of different messages
17:31 - that we would send and then we added
17:34 - the extension which makes it social
17:35 - like the tweet extension
allowing all of us
17:38 - to play this game together
and you can imagine
17:41 - doing this with kids is much more fun
17:43 - than trying to deal with the lag
17:45 - and all the other
complications of live coding
17:48 - but the idea is that it opens up a world
17:51 - of possibilities and
you saw right now only
17:55 - a character on the screen reacting
17:56 - but when we have also
a Lego robot reacting
17:59 - to what we're saying or a Cosmo robot
18:03 - or things that are in the
physical like a micro bit
18:06 - showing a heart, you can
imagine that the world
18:09 - becomes a playground
and all of these things
18:12 - can be combined in many different ways.
18:14 - Now from an AI perspective or
a customization perspective,
18:19 - if we play with this a little bit longer,
18:21 - you're quickly going to see
what are the limitations
18:23 - of this feelings extension
and then we're going to start
18:26 - to think okay who trained this extension,
18:29 - what kind of examples did they use?
18:32 - Why does it pickup, why
doesn't it pickup sarcasm
18:35 - or why doesn't it pickup more
like backhanded compliments
18:40 - and things like that so that
comes like a natural transition
18:44 - and question for kids
as they're playing along
18:47 - and poking with these
things so we build also
18:50 - on the Cognimates website,
you're going to see this link
18:52 - for teach AI, basically once
they tried existing AI models,
18:58 - it could be for vision or for
text or for many other things,
19:03 - then they can start to teach their own.
19:06 - And maybe a child would want
Nary to laugh at his jokes
19:11 - or get a very specific insider joke,
19:15 - message that he's sending so he can go
19:17 - to the teach AI page over
here and this is building
19:21 - on top of idea watson and it allows kids
19:24 - to create their custom classifiers
19:27 - so if they don't want to use
already pre-trained model
19:30 - that exists online,
they can make their own
19:33 - with their own examples.
19:34 - So in here, we could
do this make me happy,
19:37 - project, and start write examples.
19:39 - It's like what kind of
text I would like Nary
19:43 - to recognize as happy
and what kind of text
19:45 - I would like Nary to recognize as sad
19:47 - or maybe I want to add another category
19:50 - where it's not neither
happy or sad or neutral,
19:53 - it's more like,
19:56 - I don't know, weird messages, right.
19:59 - I like weird stuff so (laughs).
20:02 - So we can kind of give
much more nuance to,
20:05 - instead of black and
white and cats and dogs,
20:08 - we can start to add our own examples
20:11 - and then once we have five examples
20:13 - for each of these categories,
click on the teach me button,
20:17 - this will create a classifier
that we can use afterwards
20:22 - in our Cognimates game by
adding this text extension.
20:26 - - All right, thank you so much, Stefania,
20:28 - for being here and presenting
your work on Cognimates.
20:30 - If you're still watching this
and you want to learn more,
20:33 - check this video's description for links
20:35 - to Stefania's website,
the Cognimates website
20:37 - and other resources to
learn about Cognimates
20:40 - and AI education.
20:42 - Thanks, goodbye.
20:44 - (upbeat music)
