00:03 - Okay, so let's ask the question:
00:04 - Why should you learn to program the computer?
00:08 - and really, but, you know, 
we would first have to admit that
00:12 - the answer to that question might be.
"Hello, no,
00:15 - I don't need to do this I'm interested in lots of stuff
00:18 - and this does not interest me", 
and that's pretty reasonable, I mean first of all
00:23 - you should make sure you go outside, run around,
00:26 - physical exercise is very important,
00:28 - food is delicious, talking to people is wonderful
00:31 - I don't know, hobbies, I like playing cards, 
I like musical theatre, I don't necessarily need
00:37 - programming for those things
00:38 - so you, you can go and have a very full life
00:41 - and just stop these videos and really be
a happy person. At the same time,
00:45 - let's just make, let's just, let's just 
admit something: you probably use the
00:50 - computer a lot.
00:51 - you probably, it's probably a tool for work, family,
00:55 - social, you use it, right, and 
how do you use it,
01:00 - let's say you've never written a line of code
01:02 - before in your life. You probably do 
things like you use
01:05 - Chrome, or you use Photoshop,
01:08 - or you use Word, we could keep
01:13 - making a long list of stuff there. 
What are all these things?
01:17 - Software! Who made these things?
01:20 - Not you, right? So, you know, they're great!
01:24 - Photoshop is really good and an 
amazing piece of software
01:27 - made by very large company and 
lots of people and you need Photoshop,
01:31 - you have an image, you wanna get rid 
of the red eye
01:34 - you wanna make it brighter you wanna 
do some kind of, I don't know, filter on it to make
01:38 - it look like it was
01:39 - taken thirty years ago, 
I don't know if Photoshop does that,
01:41 - you use Photoshop, but there are limits 
to what Photoshop can do
01:48 - it is a tool with a set of features that are provided
01:51 - to you via an interface and you
01:53 - can't make it do more that it does and
in fact
01:56 - if you want to be creative if you 
wanna develop your own
02:00 - ideas whether they're art or
02:03 - a commercial product or some just 
weird strange exploration
02:07 - you don't wanna, you don't wanna be 
limited by the tools that are provided
02:11 - for you
02:11 - you want to start with a blank slate, you know,
if you want to create a new image
02:16 - processing filter that doesn't exist
02:18 - you could do that. In this video series
02:21 - you will learn to do that, and it's not very hard!
02:25 - I mean, there are aspects of programming 
that are incredibly hard this won't be easy
02:30 - don't get me wrong
02:31 - but this is really what we're talking about 
here everything that you do
02:36 - whether it's working with images, 
working with animation,
02:40 - writing, checking your email,
02:43 - interfacing with hardware, robotics,
02:47 - everything that you do digitally starts 
from somewhere, somebody wrote the
02:52 - software to make this stuff
02:54 - work why couldn't that person be you? 
what types of things could you invent?
02:58 - what types of ideas could you come up with
if you weren't limited
03:01 - to the list of tools that you can download, purchase,
03:05 - and get from, you know, other individuals 
might have released as open source
03:09 - or big companies,
03:11 - let's break all those bonds, 
let's write your own software,
03:14 - and that sounds very grand
03:15 - and ridiculous and then we're gonna be like 
and now what you're gonna learn is
03:19 - there's a red circle on the screen and it moves 
back and forth so don't me wrong,
03:23 - this is going to be a slow process this is 
really just the beginning
03:26 - I'm gonna show you some basic stuff 
you're gonna have to take it much farther
03:29 - but this will get you started in that direction if you
03:32 - and hopefully will be great. now there's also
the question, if this is maybe
03:37 - why you should learn, how you should learn
03:39 - that's a more complicated one
03:42 - I'm not prepared to answer it, I'm just 
gonna try as best I can
03:46 - to communicate to you and provide
resources but again this just brings up the
03:50 - question there are so many resources online
03:52 - that are terrific there are online courses 
you could take there's Code Academy,
03:56 - there's the Khan Academy, there's Udacity
03:58 - there's schools you can go to, there's a new
04:02 - experimental school called the School
for Poetic Computation that's opening
04:07 - there's lots of stuff out there so this
is just a little resource
04:10 - through video, I'll try to supplement it with
code examples online
04:14 - with links below the video I might
hopefully create a site with some other
04:19 - tools at some point but right now
04:20 - me talking, examples you can download, 
diagrams,
04:24 - but there is something I think
is important to mention here which is
04:28 - a lot of the tools that you might - first of all,
04:31 - you know what's a nice way to learn? 
Find a friend,
04:34 - find someone you don't even know, 
sit in a room with other people
04:37 - try to program with them, ask them
questions, look at what they're doing, try
04:41 - to explain your program to a friend,
04:42 - be with people, right, we can all try to
design the most fancy, best whatever
04:48 - online
04:48 - tool that will like show you the steps
and give you immediate feedback and step
04:52 - you through give you this exercise and
04:54 - give you all this, right, but being
with people
04:57 - and talking to people talking through
your ideas, that is probably the best way
05:01 - to learn, now that's not what's happening
here
05:03 - I'm by myself which is a little bit
weird but I'm getting used to it
05:07 - a lot more used to it than I 
was before
05:10 - but one thing I will say also that's a
little bit different here is a lot of
05:15 - the tools
05:16 - and courses, you know, that you might take
whether it's a high school class a
05:19 - college class an online class
05:21 - firstof all they might have the word "Computer Science" in them -
05:25 - Computer Science is a really great
05:29 - field of research and study of the
science of computing,
05:32 - this is not that, we're just learning
about computation
05:35 - how to write programming, how to write code, 
how to program and applying it
05:39 - to whatever you might be interested in.
are you interested in biology and could
05:43 - the tools of computation help you there? 
Are you interested in music
05:45 - and could the tools of computation be
something you could use
05:48 - with music and
05:49 - this is the other thing, that I don't have a test
for you to take
05:52 - don't have something to say like
05:55 - "and you will make this" when you're
finished with these videos the point
05:57 - of these videos
05:58 - is for you to have a creative idea and
you don't have to have that now
06:03 - you might get inspired or try experiment
s and it doesn't have to have any
06:06 - practical value, now
06:07 - you might want to get a job which 
I think is important in a lot of ways,
06:12 - but you might also just
06:13 - feel like "I like sorbet,
06:17 - and I like bugs,
06:20 - particularly spiders, and I'm going to create 
a simulation of spiders eating sorbet,"
06:25 - which actually makes no sense
whatsoever but that's the point
06:28 - you might have some idea that apparently
doesn't have any practical value that
06:32 - makes any sense but you just want to
explore it could be a visual idea
06:34 - a it could be a musical idea could be a
website, an app,
06:38 - you know, this isn't really going to
be about making products and apps
06:42 - and stuff for the web, as you're gonna see, as 
much
06:44 - but the point is you will develop 
your own ideas and make
06:50 - them and
06:50 - hopefully share them with others in some way, so
06:53 - I will try to give little exercises and little
06:58 - questions
06:58 - and push in particular directions but
how you will learn in this particular
07:04 - context
07:04 - will be about coming up with your own
creative project ideas and using the
07:09 - tools of computation
07:10 - to realize those ideas and hopefully that
will be a nice thing.
07:15 - If anybody has success with that and finds it
07:19 - useful I'd be thrilled to know. 
Okay, so that's the end of
07:21 - this particular introductory video 
and I think the
07:26 - next one is, I'm going to talk about
07:29 - actually "What is programming, what does 
it mean to write, what is programming,
07:33 - what is an algorithm, what does it mean
to program the computer?"
