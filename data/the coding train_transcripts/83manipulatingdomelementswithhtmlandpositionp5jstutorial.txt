00:00 - so in the previous video I looked at how
00:03 - you can use the p5.js create blank
00:07 - functions to create HTML elements on the
00:09 - page create an h1 element create a
00:11 - paragraph created paragraph create a
00:13 - paragraph each one using dynamic content
00:15 - like a random number so what I want to
00:17 - look at now is how you can start to
00:20 - manipulate these elements on the fly and
00:22 - a big topic of that is how to manipulate
00:25 - the style of those elements change their
00:27 - font change their color a highlight then
00:29 - when the mouse is over them those pieces
00:31 - I'm going to sort of like dip a toe into
00:33 - this I'm going to leave all the style
00:34 - stuff for an entire separate video I'm
00:36 - going to look at two pieces of
00:38 - functionality one is moving their
00:40 - position on the page and two is changing
00:43 - the content of the element itself so
00:45 - first let's just think about positioning
00:47 - on the page for a second
00:48 - so I've no idea what I'm about to draw
00:51 - whose it's going to start at this is not
00:53 - a good pen it's going to start as a
00:56 - rectangle so if this is the page you can
01:00 - see there was this h1 element then there
01:03 - was a paragraph element then there was a
01:06 - canvas was there is a canvas element
01:08 - another h1 and another paragraph so one
01:12 - thing you'll notice about hTML is it you
01:15 - know flows in this very intuitive way
01:17 - like a document each thing added to the
01:19 - page sits below the other thing there's
01:21 - some padding some margin you know what
01:24 - we're looking at is a sort of default
01:25 - styling of the page so there's really
01:27 - two things there's like you can think of
01:29 - layout and styling ink I know there's a
01:33 - blurry line between those two things but
01:35 - this is one of the things that you can
01:37 - do with Dom elements with HTML elements
01:40 - is something known as absolute
01:41 - positioning now often so the positioning
01:45 - sits like a terrible idea so you want to
01:47 - be careful here I'm going to look at
01:48 - lots of different ways of thinking about
01:50 - the flow of the page later but more what
01:52 - I want to just what I want to show you
01:53 - is this a little bit of functionality of
01:55 - how you might act on one of these
01:57 - elements and the piece of functionality
01:58 - to piece of functionality to show you is
02:00 - the position function and the HTML
02:05 - function the HTML the position function
02:08 - applies absolute positioning to an
02:10 - element so I could like just stick this
02:11 - element over on top of the canvas
02:13 - or over here the HTML function deals
02:17 - with the content that's appearing so I
02:18 - could change the header from saying I am
02:20 - making it my favorite numbers to my
02:22 - favorite colors so these are the two
02:24 - pieces of functionality that I want to
02:25 - look at but we're missing kind of a
02:27 - crucial detail here when I say there's a
02:30 - position function in an HTML function
02:32 - what do I call it on well I want to call
02:34 - it on the object associated with that h1
02:37 - element or the object associated with
02:39 - that paragraph element or the object
02:40 - associated with that canvas where is
02:42 - that object in the code I don't see it
02:44 - well here's a little secret for you it's
02:47 - not such a secret but something that I
02:48 - just didn't bother to mention before the
02:50 - create functions make an object an
02:53 - object that holds all the information
02:55 - about that element and allows you to
02:57 - execute functions on that element
02:59 - I'm just not using that object but I
03:01 - could make a variable called canvas I
03:06 - could make a variable called h1 and I
03:09 - could say canvas equals create canvas h1
03:13 - equals the create element so what I'm
03:17 - doing here is I'm saying make that
03:19 - canvas and store all the information
03:21 - associated with that canvas in this
03:23 - particular variable make that h1 element
03:26 - and store all the information about that
03:27 - element in that h1 variable and where do
03:30 - you call position where do you call HTML
03:33 - you call it on that object so these
03:35 - aren't functions just like lying around
03:37 - for you to just say you've got to say
03:39 - something dot position something dot
03:43 - HTML now honestly I don't know if I'm
03:46 - doing such a good job with this probably
03:48 - this something dot style is a function
03:50 - that you ultimately will want to use
03:52 - them most but against style.css a little
03:54 - bit of a bigger topic we'll get to that
03:56 - later so let's look at these as two
03:58 - demonstrations and there's a lot of
04:00 - functions and a lot that we're going to
04:03 - have to look at in videos there's a lot
04:04 - more that we'll see as I get to future
04:06 - and future things so let's start with
04:08 - position so here I am I'm going to say
04:12 - canvas dot position and let's just say 0
04:15 - 0 and see what happens like where is 0 0
04:18 - on the page look at that now this is
04:22 - sort of this is why absolute positioning
04:24 - can be kind of a bad idea
04:26 - like things are now like the other stuff
04:29 - is not I've got natural flow I don't
04:32 - know what that means but I've got like
04:33 - not match this a terrible war Jane's
04:34 - natural here but I've got the default
04:36 - flow of the page right of the things
04:38 - just sitting next to each other and then
04:40 - I have that I'm overriding that with
04:42 - absolute positioning by using the p5
04:44 - position function to set the canvas
04:46 - exactly there now if the canvas one
04:51 - thing I could do here which I think it
04:52 - would be interesting is I could change
04:54 - from background to clear clear is a
04:56 - function that instead of drawing a color
04:59 - across the background clears that leaves
05:01 - it transparent hope this works and you
05:02 - can see now the canvas is actually
05:05 - sitting there but all of it is
05:07 - transparent except for the rectangle I
05:08 - drew so that's sort of interesting to
05:09 - see what kinds of strange experiments
05:11 - you might have if you have an HTML page
05:13 - with a big canvas as like an overlay on
05:15 - top of it
05:16 - so that's something you can see here the
05:18 - other thing I might do is I set the
05:22 - background to white and then I might set
05:26 - the and let's put it somewhere else
05:28 - let's put it off to the side at like
05:31 - whoops sorry let's put it at like 400
05:34 - zero and then let's put this h1 element
05:38 - at 400 comma 100 and you can see here
05:44 - I'm going to take out the clear and I'm
05:46 - going to run this again and we can see
05:48 - here and now this is sort of hard to see
05:52 - what's going on so let me actually not
05:54 - make the background white but just like
05:55 - a kind of nice gray boy I don't really
05:58 - plan this very well and you can see like
06:00 - what's going on now I mean there's all
06:01 - sorts of craziness like this is the
06:02 - stuff that was in the HTML originally
06:04 - then I put the canvas over there let's
06:06 - move it down on the page that'll like be
06:08 - a little bit nicer like 500 pixels down
06:12 - and we'll put this at 600 to be in the
06:14 - middle so you can see like ah now I've
06:16 - got now I'm getting somewhere like this
06:18 - is the default flow of the HTML elements
06:21 - and then the absolute position this
06:22 - canvas and this other header down there
06:23 - what happens when I start clicking those
06:25 - other paragraphs are getting added
06:27 - without absolute positioning so they're
06:28 - up there so you can see there's a lot of
06:30 - possibilities here and how you can start
06:33 - like strangely arranging things on the
06:34 - page by letting things flow in the sort
06:37 - of document way versus absolutely
06:39 - positioning
06:40 - now there's two things that I want to
06:42 - mention here wait more than two but two
06:44 - that us around number one is this is
06:48 - interesting because the canvas is now
06:50 - positioned where the canvas is
06:52 - positioned at the coordinate 400-500
06:55 - that pixel coordinate is the pixel
06:57 - coordinate of the entire page but
06:59 - remember the rectangle is that 100/100
07:02 - that location is relative to the canvas
07:04 - itself so as you're moving the canvas
07:07 - around it still retains its own
07:10 - coordinate system so now there's two
07:12 - coordinate systems to think about if you
07:14 - using absolute positioning the
07:16 - coordinate system of the full-page and
07:17 - the coordinate system of the canvas only
07:20 - now let's do some things here - I'm
07:25 - going to leave this off for a second and
07:27 - I'm going to just reload the page like
07:30 - this you can see I've put the canvas
07:31 - down there on the bottom right let's
07:35 - look at one other piece of functionality
07:36 - which is the kind of lost - steam here a
07:42 - little bit but look at this HTML
07:43 - function so what do you do with that
07:45 - function that function changes the
07:47 - content of an element so let me come
07:49 - back over here and I'm going to add here
07:51 - in mouse press so what I'm going to do
07:53 - is I'm going to say I'm going to start
07:58 - this h1 element with just the text
08:01 - weighting and now I run it you can see
08:05 - I've got the HTML element the the one
08:08 - that I created the canvas down there now
08:10 - when I click mousepressed I'm going to
08:13 - say h1 HTML now I will show you my
08:18 - favorite number so when I create the
08:23 - element I give it default content or the
08:25 - starting content waiting when I click
08:28 - the mouse I change its content to this
08:30 - other text this is another thing that
08:32 - you can do to manipulate the elements on
08:34 - the fly so let me run this you can see
08:36 - it says waiting as soon as I click the
08:38 - mouse it changes to now I'll show you my
08:41 - favorite numbers and those other
08:43 - elements are added as well so these are
08:46 - two pieces of functionality that you can
08:48 - use you can use
08:51 - the position function - absolute
08:55 - position elements along the page kind of
08:57 - regardless of what the sort of what the
09:00 - default flow document flow of the page
09:02 - is and you can also use the HTML
09:04 - function to change a piece of content at
09:06 - a given time now there's a two more
09:09 - things I always say - that I'm thinking
09:11 - of here one is what if you wanted to
09:14 - change the content of up there I am
09:16 - making a video right well that's not an
09:19 - element that I made in my JavaScript so
09:22 - I don't have a reference to it right
09:23 - that element if you recall is just
09:25 - written in to the HTML file itself so
09:28 - there is a way to do that I'm leaving
09:30 - that for a later video right now in what
09:33 - you're able to do if you're just
09:34 - following these along exactly is you're
09:36 - you're going to want it the elements
09:38 - that you want to manipulate make those
09:40 - elements in JavaScript the elements that
09:41 - you don't need to manipulate leave those
09:43 - in the HTML and you're going to see that
09:44 - that line between those two things is
09:47 - going to get absolutely erased but sort
09:49 - of worth looking at for that's sort of a
09:51 - restriction in terms of what I've shown
09:52 - you so far the other thing that I think
09:54 - is worth noting is that remember there's
09:56 - an animation loop going on here for the
09:58 - canvas for example if I add var X equals
10:04 - 100 VAR y equals 100 and then I draw the
10:09 - rectangle at those locations and I say
10:11 - you know x equals x plus random negative
10:14 - 5 5 so now here in the draw loop you can
10:18 - see look there's an animation going on
10:20 - here where that canvas is animating but
10:22 - it's not just that the canvas is
10:24 - animation animating this draw loop is
10:26 - happening over and over and over and
10:28 - over and over again so let's look at
10:29 - something like kind of strange that I
10:31 - can do what if I said in here h1
10:35 - position X comma Y now is that h1 going
10:40 - to appear where's that h1 going to
10:42 - appear is it going to appear on top of
10:44 - the rectangle right the rectangle is
10:46 - drawn at an X Y and the header h1 the
10:49 - thing is now drawn at the X Y they
10:51 - should be on top of each other no the
10:53 - answer is not true because remember Dom
10:55 - elements their position is relative to
10:57 - the entire page things you're drawing on
10:59 - the canvas are relative to just the
11:01 - canvas itself so that
11:03 - one element will be at 100 100 relative
11:05 - the top-left corner of the page the
11:07 - rectangle Braille to the top left corner
11:09 - of the canvas so let me run this again
11:11 - and you can see look at that
11:13 - waiting is now jiggling that text is now
11:16 - jiggling up there as well so in the same
11:18 - way that you apply variables to things
11:21 - that you draw on animate in the canvas
11:23 - you can apply those variables to things
11:25 - that you might want to move or animate
11:27 - or change on the page and so with that
11:32 - I'm going to stop this video now and
11:34 - then in the next video I want to look at
11:36 - events so binding events tying events to
11:41 - those Dom elements I think that's all
11:42 - the next thing on my list let me look
11:43 - here
11:44 - whatever I'll I'll figure it out what I
11:46 - get that I think that's what it is um
11:48 - but for you if you're looking for an
11:50 - exercise to do right now right first you
11:52 - add it stuff to the HTML page then you
11:55 - get made HTML elements in JavaScript now
11:58 - see if you can animate those Dom
11:59 - elements animate your canvas by using
12:01 - position or change the content what if
12:04 - you made Dom elements content a random
12:08 - number every frame or what if you
12:09 - displayed the XY location of something
12:12 - in your canvas as a text element on the
12:14 - page or paragraph element so those are
12:16 - some things you can try ok and stop
