00:03 - [Music]
00:13 - hello there morning welcome to coding
00:16 - trained hour of code special today's
00:20 - gonna be a little bit different I have a
00:21 - feeling that I just livestream myself
00:23 - saying test test by the way if that's
00:25 - the case please let me know but I'm
00:28 - gonna do things a little differently
00:29 - today in the sense that I don't expect
00:31 - that this is a kind of free this is less
00:35 - of a free-form session where that will
00:37 - get edited at chunks later this is going
00:39 - to be a one-hour standalone session so
00:41 - I'm going to jump right into the topic
00:43 - but hello I am Dan I'm a weird person on
00:47 - the internet with a coding channel that
00:50 - has train themed my life is very strange
00:53 - but what can I say I can't complain
00:55 - alright so starting off here sound level
01:00 - is low that's interesting I have a new
01:02 - mic and people told me that the sound
01:05 - level was low before as well um
01:08 - [Music]
01:09 - interesting I I did say test okay I'm
01:15 - going to do this real quick
01:17 - okay I think this should help the sound
01:19 - level and then I'm gonna check one more
01:21 - thing and I apologize to anybody who is
01:24 - now watching this as a recorded archive
01:27 - because if you're watching this as a
01:30 - recorded r-ky you're now watching me
01:33 - debug the sound and the sound is out of
01:38 - sync
01:38 - Oh people are saying sounds good I
01:40 - should never look at the chat I'm gonna
01:44 - I am going to I'm now looking at the
01:47 - coding train the slack channel I am
01:49 - going to snap my fingers and tell me how
01:51 - the sound is right after I snap my
01:53 - fingers so snaps use the word snap
01:57 - finger sound or something like that
01:59 - because everything sounds good alright
02:01 - oh uh hundred mill you know okay maybe
02:06 - I'll change this so people are saying
02:08 - this sound is out of sync by a hundred
02:10 - milliseconds I actually have a setting
02:12 - in here
02:13 - that puts it out of sync on purpose by
02:16 - 100 milliseconds because it was out of
02:18 - sync by a hundred milliseconds in maybe
02:20 - hopefully what was the opposite
02:21 - direction so uh since a bunch of people
02:24 - are saying this I am now going to go to
02:26 - just really kidding I am NOT I start
02:34 - over I'm going to go to the advanced
02:38 - audio properties here and I'm going to
02:41 - turn off the out the 100 milliseconds
02:45 - offset whoever said it was 100
02:48 - milliseconds okay so I don't know if
02:51 - that changed it or fixed it but I am now
02:53 - going to proceed welcome this is the
02:58 - coding tray an hour of code special I
03:00 - don't know if there's anyone you know I
03:01 - always have this dream that I'll be able
03:03 - to do like these one out on one hour
03:05 - session like this and actually have a
03:06 - classroom of students perhaps in middle
03:09 - school or high school or some other
03:11 - community context tuning in live to code
03:15 - along with me I don't think that's the
03:17 - case right now
03:18 - but if you are a classroom tuning in
03:21 - life and seeing me with my magic mug
03:24 - please let me know say hi in the chat I
03:26 - will try to catch it alright so first
03:31 - what is the hour of code so the hour of
03:33 - code is an initiative put on by
03:36 - organization called code.org you can
03:38 - find a lot of different tutorials here
03:40 - at hour of code comm slash learn I think
03:42 - we've got a very interesting discussion
03:43 - about the pros and cons of Computer
03:46 - Science Education Week an hour of code
03:48 - but I am going to bypass that and just
03:51 - embrace the idea in my own way but I
03:54 - want to say that what I'm going to do
03:55 - today in this hour is I was a
03:57 - intermediate level so if you are someone
04:00 - who has never programmed before I might
04:03 - suggest starting out with a different
04:05 - tutorial you can find many again at that
04:07 - link a tower of code but a couple that I
04:08 - would suggest I mean I'm suggesting one
04:10 - that I'm involved with so I'm not
04:12 - suggesting that somehow my tutorials are
04:15 - any better but I know about them and I
04:17 - know that what that what's in them so I
04:18 - can suggest them ok so one is first I
04:21 - worked with a new education website
04:24 - called Publio on
04:26 - Twitter at pebbly o1 and if you go to
04:28 - our of code comm slash Publio art you
04:31 - will find the tutorial there which has
04:34 - me in the videos but the tutorial
04:36 - actually let me click over to it so here
04:40 - I'm just gonna skip this video you could
04:41 - watch it'll introduce you to the
04:43 - tutorial but if you click here and get
04:44 - started and just let's go hold on
04:53 - that's weird
04:55 - oh there we go okay I think was just
04:59 - taking a minute to load so here I'm at
05:01 - the pebbly Oh hour of code code inspired
05:03 - by artists you can see a bunch of videos
05:04 - here but also there is an inline editor
05:08 - that you can try the code you can follow
05:10 - each video one at a time read these
05:12 - instructions and by the end you can make
05:15 - your own composition and share it so
05:17 - this is this I would recommend for total
05:20 - beginners if you've never programmed
05:22 - before you can check out this Publio
05:24 - hour of code using p5.js alright next up
05:29 - there is also this is several years old
05:32 - now but a tutorial that I worked on in
05:36 - collaboration with other people from the
05:38 - processing foundation is also at oh my
05:41 - goodness I never put a little Miss tweet
05:43 - I didn't put a link to it but if that
05:45 - hello dot processing org so this is an
05:47 - interactive tutorial that will is very
05:50 - similar to the pebbly oh one with just a
05:52 - completely different interface but also
05:53 - this syntax is processing Java syntax
05:56 - it's running in the browser through this
05:58 - sort of the magic of kind of how
06:01 - processing Java code can be translated
06:03 - the JavaScript but that's another story
06:04 - for another time
06:06 - you can check that one out there's also
06:07 - a wonderful youtube channel called stem
06:10 - coding that is from like oh s you is
06:16 - that ohio state university oh my
06:17 - goodness osu stem coding let's take a
06:23 - look at this and christopher obon Oh
06:26 - Ohio State University I was right sure
06:29 - okay so you can check out a stem coding
06:31 - and they have also some nice
06:34 - intermediate level tutorials and
06:36 - probably some beginner ones with
06:38 - accompanying YouTube videos and
06:40 - is terrific okay so that's my quick just
06:44 - like send you off in a different
06:45 - direction if you don't feel like being
06:47 - here right now or maybe that's
06:49 - intermediate level isn't appropriate for
06:51 - you so I'm hoping this will take about
06:54 - an hour
06:54 - so we'll be done by 11 a.m. I might
06:57 - stick around after and do some other
06:58 - usual coding train shinanigans but what
07:01 - I'm going to attempt to build I'm gonna
07:03 - show you how to make this how come this
07:05 - won't play because I hit play so what
07:07 - this is you're seeing here is in the p5
07:09 - editor I am accessing the webcam I am
07:13 - painting that webcam onto an html5
07:15 - canvas in the browser and then I am
07:19 - drawing on top of the webcam feed with
07:22 - shapes and I am setting the location of
07:25 - those shapes tracking certain elements
07:27 - of my face so this is what I am going to
07:30 - show you how to do now what do you need
07:32 - in order to follow along and again I'm
07:34 - gonna try to do this a little
07:35 - differently in the sense that I might
07:37 - like type a little bit pause I'm
07:39 - assuming that you're coding with me and
07:42 - you're gonna try something maybe you'll
07:43 - ask a question in the chat we'll see
07:46 - we'll see how this goes all right so the
07:49 - only thing that you need is the online
07:52 - p5.js web editor you can find that at
07:56 - editor dot p5.js org and then I would
07:59 - suggest signing up for an account so I'm
08:02 - not gonna go through signing up for an
08:03 - account right now but you'll just you
08:05 - need an email address um you can I think
08:07 - you can also if you have a Google
08:09 - account already you can sign in through
08:10 - your Google account or if you have
08:11 - something called a github account you
08:13 - can sign through that but go ahead sign
08:15 - up for an account I'll wait
08:18 - and show you more of my magic bug
08:21 - because the coding trade is brought to
08:23 - you by invisibility I bet you you don't
08:30 - need captain disillusion to figure out
08:32 - how I did this trick with my mud you
08:37 - think that I'm a little bit too obsessed
08:38 - with cap dissolute you might be
08:40 - right alright so I'm gonna assume now
08:45 - that you've signed up for the p5.js web
08:48 - editor an account and you'll see now you
08:50 - might not look exactly like this to you
08:52 - in under in this little icon over here
08:55 - there's a Settings button and you can
08:57 - actually click here under under theme
08:59 - there are different themes light dark
09:01 - high contrast I have it on high contrast
09:03 - right now I think that looks tend to
09:05 - look best on on YouTube so so the first
09:13 - thing that I want to do is now if you've
09:15 - never I'm assuming that you come to this
09:17 - having learned a little bit of p5 or
09:19 - JavaScript already but just in case what
09:22 - we have are two functions function set
09:24 - up function draw function set up is
09:26 - calling this function called create
09:28 - canvas and that is making this square
09:31 - that you now see over here on your right
09:33 - or my right or my left right it is 400
09:38 - by 400 pixels so I'm actually just
09:40 - changed that to 640 480 if I want to be
09:45 - like if I want to like just really live
09:47 - on the edge
09:48 - I couldn't click this Auto refresh
09:50 - button and then as I change things it
09:54 - will actually live update so now the
09:56 - canvas is 640 pixels by 480 and what I
10:02 - want to do also now is I want to hit say
10:03 - I did save I want to just change the
10:05 - name of this so I'm gonna call this
10:06 - coding train clown nose that's well
10:14 - that's basically the whole gist of what
10:17 - I want to do is just get put a clown
10:18 - nose on my nose on the coding train I'm
10:22 - looking for my bell here it is
10:28 - all right here we go
10:31 - now the first thing I want to do is gain
10:33 - access to the camera so the way that I'm
10:35 - going to do that is I'm going to declare
10:37 - a variable I'm gonna use the keyword let
10:42 - I have a whole video about why you
10:44 - sometimes say var why you might say let
10:47 - and why you might say Const in doubt
10:50 - just use let's so I'm gonna say let
10:52 - video so I'm gonna create a variable
10:55 - called video and that video is going to
10:57 - that variable is going to hold on to all
10:59 - of the information about my webcam
11:02 - that's on this computer and then in
11:04 - setup in setup I want to connect to that
11:06 - webcam so I'm gonna say video equals
11:08 - create capture to create capture
11:12 - function conductor yes I guess it should
11:16 - be
11:16 - Rost all in the in the live chat that's
11:18 - going on right now suggest that I should
11:20 - be putting on a conductors hat like a
11:22 - train person okay create capture is the
11:26 - function that will create a capture
11:27 - object that is in video form and now all
11:32 - of a sudden as soon as I add that here
11:34 - you could see suddenly it's asking for
11:35 - my permission so on a website this p5
11:39 - sketch that I'm programming in the web
11:40 - editor
11:41 - he lives on a web server and I'm looking
11:43 - at it through my web browser a website a
11:48 - web page is not allowed to just connect
11:50 - to your web cam without permission
11:52 - imagine if it was able to you could on
11:55 - your web so you could publish a website
11:57 - that anybody that goes to it you
11:59 - suddenly connect to their camera and
12:01 - grab images and like save them on your
12:03 - server so you're going to want to opt-in
12:06 - here let down what I'm programming here
12:08 - your camera images actually never get
12:10 - sent anywhere I'm just giving permission
12:12 - to the browser to use them on your
12:15 - computer as it runs this sketch so I'm
12:18 - gonna click allow and then we should see
12:20 - down here look it's a green screen this
12:23 - whole thing operates with way too much
12:27 - shadow and the sound is bad in here and
12:29 - someday it's all gonna get better
12:30 - alright so now you can see there it is
12:32 - now the video is below the canvas right
12:36 - there's the canvas there's the video so
12:39 - this create
12:40 - sure actually creates a separate element
12:44 - on the page this over here is like the
12:47 - thing that I'm making this is the code
12:49 - let me zoom back out this is the code
12:51 - that's making the thing so create canvas
12:54 - makes this canvas create capture makes
12:57 - this video capture but what I actually
12:58 - want to do is I want to draw this video
13:01 - in the canvas because the canvas the
13:04 - place that I can put my own creative
13:06 - spin on stuff and change colors and draw
13:08 - shapes and do animation and that sort of
13:10 - thing so there's a little bit of a delay
13:12 - do you see that so I am now going to I'm
13:17 - gonna put my semicolon here I use
13:19 - semicolons I'm a proud semicolon user so
13:24 - why am I making this joke you don't
13:25 - technically you don't need to have put
13:27 - semicolons at the end of your lines of
13:28 - code and I don't know some people you
13:32 - know maybe I this is the thing this this
13:34 - will make me completely insane no
13:36 - semicolon here but a semicolon here I
13:37 - like consistency but you know you
13:39 - shouldn't be like me you should just use
13:41 - semicolons and not use semicolons and
13:43 - enjoy your life enjoy your life not
13:45 - worrying about semicolons okay now I am
13:48 - going to down here use a function called
13:51 - image image is a function that will draw
13:54 - an image to your canvas guess what image
13:56 - I want to draw I want to draw the image
13:58 - from that video so I will say video then
14:01 - I need to say where I want to draw it
14:03 - and where I want to draw it is the top
14:06 - left corner of the canvas which is the
14:08 - location pixel 0 comma 0 and if you're
14:11 - not familiar with coordinate systems
14:13 - again some of those other oh boy there I
14:15 - am a double vision here if you're not
14:16 - familiar with coordinate systems there's
14:21 - other hour of code tutorials that I
14:23 - referred you to will go through that in
14:24 - detail but basically that the top left
14:28 - is coordinates 0 0 there is a horizontal
14:30 - axis called the x-axis which has pixels
14:33 - going from now from 0 to 639 technically
14:37 - there is no 640 a--the pixel if you
14:40 - think about that right if you have 10 if
14:43 - the width is 10 but the first pixel is 0
14:46 - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 wait oh no but I
14:52 - didn't end right I counted
14:53 - that's so confusing right zero one two
14:56 - three four five six seven eight nine I
14:58 - counted ten things but I ended at nine
15:01 - because I started at zero and actually
15:03 - counting from zero is a thing that
15:04 - happens it's just about all the time in
15:06 - programming so pixel zero two pixels
15:09 - 6:39 on the lung the horizontal axis
15:12 - pixels zero - what is it 479 along the
15:17 - y-axis now I don't need to have double
15:19 - vision of myself so I'm going to say
15:20 - video dot hide here so now I just have
15:24 - I'm creating that video element then I
15:28 - am then I'm hiding it and then in this
15:33 - draw loop this is the thing that's
15:34 - happening over and over again I'm
15:35 - drawing the image to the canvas and I
15:38 - guess at this point I don't need this
15:40 - background function because ultimately
15:42 - the video is sitting there as the
15:44 - background all right so I'm gonna pause
15:46 - and see if you everybody has this
15:50 - working if you're falling along is this
15:52 - working for you are you running into an
15:53 - issue please ask a question in the chat
15:56 - okay might give you like a few minutes
15:58 - here to catch up so mr. awesome size in
16:08 - the chat put intermediate level in
16:10 - quotes I don't I I assume that's some
16:12 - kind of like air quotes
16:14 - sarcasm type of thing and may be that
16:17 - this is like so beginner a yes this is
16:19 - beginner I should have said this is like
16:21 - beginner intermediate like the point of
16:24 - this is to be very beginner friendly and
16:26 - you really don't have to have done
16:27 - anything before but I am NOT starting
16:30 - you know I haven't explained everything
16:32 - every what every parenthesis means how
16:35 - is this what is an a JavaScript object
16:37 - all that sort of stuff alright in
16:42 - working for me I see it's working yes I
16:46 - can count to ten yes I should put my
16:49 - waiting music arm
16:51 - I see that Simon is typing Simon loyal
16:56 - viewer of the coding train you should
16:58 - all check out Simon's YouTube channel
17:00 - but Simon saying I think that is
17:02 - advanced ok great
17:04 - it may be intermediate level the sarcasm
17:07 - there was like this is so advanced like
17:09 - it's not intermediate I don't know all
17:13 - right now ah rayon ass I want to make
17:19 - Instagram filters using this can i yes
17:22 - oh this could have been a great hour of
17:25 - code activity to think about how to make
17:28 - an Instagram filter and in fact at a
17:31 - recent creative coding fest event
17:34 - creative coding fest is an event that's
17:36 - happened in several different cities
17:38 - organized by oh it's really been a half
17:40 - an hour already and hold on I'm just
17:47 - gonna click something here there was a
17:52 - workshop about making Instagram style
17:54 - filters in p5 and in fact I think I
17:57 - could do something like this right now
17:59 - filter gray look at that suddenly I have
18:05 - added another function called filter
18:07 - gray and it has after I've drawn the
18:11 - video it's filtered it and one thing
18:13 - that I want to show you here is if you
18:15 - want to go and you want to just stop
18:16 - watching this video and go off in your
18:17 - own direction which I encourage you to
18:19 - do where you're gonna find out how this
18:22 - stuff works is at the p5.js website now
18:25 - a real point of confusion and I see this
18:29 - constantly over and over and over and
18:31 - over again is what's the difference
18:34 - between p5 and JavaScript am i learning
18:37 - JavaScript am i learning p5 i heard i
18:40 - want to I want to be a web developer I
18:41 - want to be a programmer I want to make
18:43 - art I want to like make data
18:45 - visualization all these types of things
18:47 - what am i learning what should i 'la
18:48 - this is very hard there are no easy
18:51 - answers to this question and the more
18:53 - you try stuff and and andreen
18:57 - and experiment the more these concepts I
19:00 - think will become more comfortable for
19:02 - you but let me try to put it let me try
19:04 - to say to my own words right now what
19:09 - you are seeing right here is JavaScript
19:11 - the programming language here is
19:13 - JavaScript if you're writing this code
19:15 - you are learning JavaScript the keyword
19:17 - function the fact that there's a
19:19 - semicolon the fact that there's a
19:20 - parenthesis here these are all elements
19:23 - of JavaScript and this code is being
19:25 - interpreted in real time by the browser
19:28 - too because it understands JavaScript to
19:31 - show this result over here now
19:34 - JavaScript itself as a language does it
19:37 - just have some magic function in it that
19:40 - draws a video image no once you're in a
19:46 - programming language you need to use
19:48 - some library of functions that are made
19:51 - available to you the web browser
19:54 - provides a library of lots of functions
19:58 - in JavaScript that could do things like
19:59 - video and and and handle buttons and
20:02 - interaction and do behaviors and set
20:04 - Styles all that kind of stuff that's
20:06 - often referred to as vanilla JavaScript
20:07 - or native JavaScript it's it's really
20:10 - native to the browser those functions
20:12 - exist because you're programming
20:14 - javascript in the browser you can also
20:16 - use libraries that other people have
20:20 - written with additional functionality
20:21 - and that's what p5 is the goal of p5 is
20:25 - a JavaScript library to make getting
20:27 - started with learning to program in
20:29 - JavaScript to sketch and make art and be
20:32 - creative and experiment and leave you on
20:34 - a variety of different kinds of paths
20:37 - that's what p5 is ok so here I'm looking
20:40 - at what are the functions available in a
20:43 - p5 I'm gonna go under reference I'm just
20:45 - gonna do a find on the page for filter
20:47 - because if we look at filter now we can
20:49 - see threshold gray opaque invert so
20:54 - let's try some of these well I'm not
20:57 - sure what is opaque who wants to use my
21:01 - microphone now that's interesting okay
21:03 - hold on I don't know what okay but
21:06 - huh opaque actually I don't know what
21:09 - just happened there that was crazy let's
21:11 - listen let's go back to threshold I
21:12 - don't know why suddenly that turned my
21:14 - microphone on and then all this feedback
21:15 - happened oh no no no oh I'm like typing
21:18 - this in totally the wrong place
21:20 - oh what a what up what a world we live
21:25 - in where you can make these kinds of
21:26 - mistakes so by the way what is this this
21:29 - is like a keyword constant that p5 knows
21:32 - about and I'm making a particular kind
21:34 - of capture that is a video and I think
21:36 - by accident like just through some set
21:38 - of coincidences but key word opaque
21:41 - inside of Korea capture made it connect
21:42 - to the microphone which is not at all
21:43 - what I want to do I want to filter
21:46 - opaque huh interesting
21:49 - let's try threshold there we go
21:54 - threshold is a kind of an interesting
21:55 - one right do you notice what's happening
21:57 - with this image every single pixel is
22:00 - now being rendered as either purely
22:02 - white or purely black based on its
22:04 - original brightness and actually
22:06 - standing in front of a green screen you
22:07 - get kind of a nice effect here
22:08 - my shiny sweater maybe this is all my
22:11 - gray hair you're seeing here okay so we
22:13 - could keep going with these but I'm
22:15 - going to stop and I'm going to move on
22:17 - to do something different so in this
22:20 - activity what I want to do is send this
22:26 - video image to something else now I'm
22:28 - kind of like this is why this is
22:30 - intermediate level I'm going to jump
22:31 - leaps and bounds off away from p5 and
22:35 - I'm going to incorporate a library
22:38 - called ml5 I've used ml5 quite a bit on
22:42 - my channel ml5 is another JavaScript
22:45 - library to add additional functionality
22:47 - for you it's built with based on on top
22:50 - of its using the foundation of it is
22:53 - this other library called tensor flow
22:55 - chance so tensor flow j/s is a library
22:59 - an open source library for machine
23:01 - learning machine learning being a field
23:03 - that's kind of you if you haven't heard
23:05 - that term before you've probably heard
23:06 - the term artificial intelligence and
23:08 - these terms are linked but what machine
23:10 - learning can do is
23:11 - you can teach your computer she could
23:14 - teach an algorithm to learn based on
23:16 - some set of data so I can say to the
23:18 - computer here's a lot of cat images now
23:21 - you know about cats here's a lot of dog
23:23 - images now you know about dogs now I'm
23:25 - going to show you a new image can you
23:27 - guess whether it's a cat or a dog that
23:29 - is what machine learning algorithm is a
23:31 - classic example of what a machine
23:33 - learning algorithm can do ml5 comes with
23:37 - a bunch of sort of pre-prepared machine
23:41 - learning results for you to play with
23:43 - and I talked more detail about what I
23:46 - mean by machine learning results it's
23:48 - actually called a machine learning and
23:49 - model in other videos so I'm not gonna
23:52 - go too far into detail but I'm gonna
23:54 - make use of a particular feature that's
23:56 - in in ml5 called
23:59 - pose net so pose net is a machine
24:02 - learning model which allows for
24:04 - real-time human pose estimation in the
24:07 - browser
24:07 - what is human pose estimation it is
24:11 - basically the computer has been trained
24:14 - on a lot of images of people with the
24:17 - corresponding pose information means
24:20 - where's the shoulder where's the elbows
24:21 - where's the feet where are the eyes and
24:23 - you can see some folks here from Google
24:25 - Creative Lab so we just happened over
24:28 - here like I thought but it just I think
24:30 - it was a thing that's lit or whatever so
24:33 - you can see all these these nice folks
24:35 - from Google Creative Lab hello
24:37 - demonstrating that the pose net model is
24:40 - able to look at their image and kind of
24:42 - make guesses as to where their knees are
24:44 - where their feet are that type of thing
24:46 - so if you want to learn more about pose
24:49 - net this article by dan-o vet who is
24:52 - actually a current student here at ITP
24:54 - NYU where I teach
24:55 - and you can see also these folks from
24:57 - the Google Creative Lab who helped put
24:59 - this article together this will give you
25:01 - a lot of background but I'm just gonna
25:03 - go ahead and use it and how am I gonna
25:06 - use it I'm gonna go here to reference
25:08 - I'm gonna go here to actually know it I
25:11 - got a step we got to do one step first
25:12 - hold on we're going to go to let me go
25:16 - back to the ml5 web site and I'm gonna
25:18 - click here under get started so in order
25:20 - to use ml5 we first got to import the
25:24 - library so
25:25 - in the p5 web editor the p5 library is
25:29 - there automatically and available to you
25:31 - you can say create capture you can say
25:33 - image all those functions are there
25:35 - because p5 is available the p5 web
25:37 - editor is not going to know about ml5
25:40 - that library so in order to tell it I'm
25:44 - going to go and copy this I want to go
25:46 - to that getting started page on ml5 JS
25:48 - org I'm going to do command C to copy
25:51 - this line this script tag this is a
25:54 - reference to the current version
25:56 - actually I'm going to change this
25:58 - actually should be at the time of this
25:59 - recording zero point one point three is
26:02 - the current version of ml five guess we
26:04 - have to update the website so I'm gonna
26:06 - grab this I am going to go back to my
26:09 - sketch now I am going to go up here to
26:12 - this top left where you see this little
26:14 - arrow this arrow shape indicates where I
26:17 - can edit other files beyond just my
26:20 - JavaScript code so my JavaScript code is
26:23 - in this file called sketch j/s but I
26:25 - want to click this and I want to go to
26:28 - index.html so I'm going to go to
26:31 - index.html click on that and you can see
26:34 - this is my index.html now just for a
26:36 - second I'm going to move myself away
26:37 - here and you can see look at all these
26:39 - links these are actually the references
26:43 - to the p5 library this is how the the
26:47 - thing you're coding in the browser knows
26:50 - about the p5 library these are put there
26:52 - automatically for you by the by the
26:54 - online editor itself now I just want to
26:57 - add one more paste it in here and you
27:00 - can see now I'm adding a script tag that
27:06 - refers to the ml5 library and I'm just
27:08 - gonna also change this to 0.3 because I
27:11 - want to use a more recent version
27:12 - libraries code libraries tend to have
27:16 - versions so you can see p5 is currently
27:19 - on version zero point seven point two
27:21 - and ml five is on version zero point one
27:24 - point three incidentally what these
27:26 - numbers mean this is something called
27:27 - semantic versioning these numbers go up
27:31 - as little changes little bugs little
27:34 - things are fixed in the library so if
27:35 - something tiny changed in ml five
27:38 - this new version might be released at
27:40 - 0.1 point for if something more
27:43 - substantial a new a new feature is added
27:47 - or something more substantial changes
27:50 - then this number might change and this
27:52 - number whoa hey something's really going
27:55 - on if that number changes and you'll
27:57 - notice that both ml 5 and P 5 their new
28:00 - libraries experimental in progress open
28:03 - source projects they're both on version
28:06 - 0 essentially but someday you'll see a
28:09 - 1.0 version and that bloom that will
28:11 - mean something will be an exciting
28:12 - moment alright so now I am going to go
28:16 - back up here and close this I hit save
28:18 - I'm gonna close this oh no actually I
28:20 - want to open it cuz I want to get back
28:22 - to sketch J s and then I'm gonna close
28:24 - it and then I'm just gonna everything's
28:26 - still running and I'm gonna bring this
28:27 - back over here so I can see it again so
28:30 - now the ml 5 library should be imported
28:34 - so now that the ml 5 library is imported
28:37 - I want to go here and I'm going to look
28:41 - at the pose net reference page so one
28:44 - thing I think actually I mean maybe by
28:46 - the time you're watching this in the
28:47 - future this will have changed
28:48 - I noticed recently that on the ml 5
28:50 - website we have these documentation
28:53 - links as well as these example links and
28:55 - there's kind of a lot of redundant
28:57 - information on both and it might make
28:59 - sense for just each feature to have a
29:01 - documentation page with an example
29:03 - rather than be so separate example so I
29:05 - honestly I might like if I click on this
29:07 - example page by the way it's gonna ask
29:09 - to use my camera and we can see there is
29:11 - pose net running so I want to build
29:13 - basically exactly this so you can see
29:15 - here pose net the pose net machine
29:19 - learning model is guessing where my eyes
29:21 - are where my nose is where my ears are
29:23 - where my shoulders are you know in
29:25 - theory it's guess man now it's really
29:27 - designed if I can if I can demonstrate
29:29 - this
29:30 - it's really meant let me turn the camera
29:34 - this way and see if I can go further
29:35 - back it's really meant to work with a
29:37 - full body and you can see it's even
29:40 - having trouble making like a good
29:41 - guesses because it's only seeing me from
29:43 - the waist up has ever seen me from the
29:46 - waist down of the internet apparently
29:49 - but and so if I could reach so if you
29:53 - are using clothes that you probably want
29:55 - to get yourself in a scenario where you
29:56 - can back up and get a sort of full body
29:59 - view to get the sort of full power of
30:01 - what pose net can do but incidentally
30:02 - it's actually pretty accurate of
30:04 - tracking the face there are other
30:05 - libraries JavaScript libraries that can
30:07 - do more sophisticated face tracking with
30:10 - many more points on the face and there's
30:12 - something called I think it's called
30:13 - face api AAS but if i just want to put
30:16 - my clown nose or put on a little hat or
30:18 - something the what pose net is super
30:21 - fast it's gonna find eyes nose ears you
30:23 - can you can do a lot with just that
30:25 - alright so i think what i want to try to
30:28 - do now is go back to the documentation
30:31 - page which has a sort of some very basic
30:34 - code now this is going to be a little
30:36 - bit confusing here actually as this code
30:38 - on the documentation page is not
30:40 - necessarily written oh sorry i'm seeing
30:45 - some stuff in the chat which is a good
30:46 - which is some great questions i want to
30:49 - get to these questions one question was
30:50 - shouldn't i check to make sure ml v
30:52 - loaded properly yes and people are
30:55 - asking questions about Poe's net can you
30:57 - train your own model does it detect
30:59 - multiple faces so these are all really
31:01 - good questions let's actually make sure
31:04 - I'm going to answer those in a second
31:06 - let's let's go with I think was Alvaro
31:08 - suggested I should probably say console
31:10 - dot log ml five just to make sure ml
31:13 - five is loaded so yes so console dot log
31:17 - is a function you can call to log
31:20 - something to the console and this in the
31:22 - p5 web editor is the console down here I
31:24 - kind of want to make this bigger just
31:27 - for a second and you can see here look
31:28 - it logged something if you're seeing all
31:31 - of this that means ml five loaded
31:33 - properly right if I if I were to change
31:39 - this to like ml four it's gonna say this
31:42 - is what you're gonna see if ml five is
31:44 - not loaded properly so let me pause for
31:46 - a second it's ten thirty
31:47 - I have another thirty five to forty
31:50 - minutes of this particular tutorial let
31:53 - me pause that make sure everyone has ml
31:54 - five loaded and then I'll answer some of
31:56 - those other questions I think I'm
31:58 - hearing like some feedback okay
32:00 - turn that off okay now what were the
32:09 - questions so going back to here so first
32:13 - of all can you train your own pose net
32:15 - model now this is actually a really
32:17 - important big question so you can tune
32:20 - out for me for a second if you're trying
32:21 - to get ml5 installed or skip ahead a
32:23 - minute
32:23 - if yours net here is I'm you know I'm
32:26 - not really at the moment in what I'm
32:29 - doing like I'm not really practicing or
32:32 - learning or participating in the full
32:35 - story of the machine learning process
32:37 - I'm just using kind of affection of I'm
32:40 - using the most powerful bit in a way but
32:42 - it's the very last thing that happens in
32:44 - the machine learning process because
32:45 - what I want to do is make some
32:46 - interactive project that tracks my nose
32:49 - if you read this article and you'll find
32:52 - out more about what was the data set
32:55 - that the people who did train the model
32:58 - who participated in that full story use
33:00 - and so there was a data set I I think we
33:06 - can find it loan just give me a second
33:08 - here because I think it's mentioned here
33:10 - in the article yeah you might have to
33:16 - dig into these links to find out more
33:17 - about the actual data set I'm happy to
33:19 - kind of like go down that rabbit hole
33:22 - and provide some resources in this
33:23 - video's description later for that but
33:25 - what you have to realize is that there
33:28 - is a data set of that was used that has
33:31 - people mapped to their poses now what
33:35 - would happen if that data set just for
33:37 - example only had men in it and there
33:40 - were no women in that data set maybe
33:44 - when you again went to use the model
33:46 - that that pre that model that was
33:48 - trained on that data set it wouldn't
33:49 - work very well with women now I don't
33:52 - know if that's the case we'd have to
33:54 - like actually scientifically analyze
33:56 - whether that actually matters so much in
33:58 - terms of this particular model but this
34:00 - is something that you've probably heard
34:01 - about in the news or thought about or
34:03 - read about the fact that why do some
34:06 - machine learning models
34:07 - work with people of different races or
34:09 - ethnicities or genders this is really
34:13 - something that is important to be
34:15 - thoughtful and conscientious about as
34:17 - you're using as algorithms start to make
34:20 - more and more decisions for us in our
34:22 - daily lives now in this case for making
34:24 - an interactive project I find that the I
34:26 - haven't found a really significant
34:29 - limitation or problem with PostNet but
34:34 - you could imagine that if you if you
34:37 - really wanted the most accurate thing
34:38 - ever to train to recognize your
34:41 - particular poses if you trained a model
34:43 - on only you it might work really more
34:47 - accurately than pose net which is
34:48 - trained more generically I'm really
34:50 - going off on a tangent here now so why
34:55 - am I talking about this here's the thing
34:56 - though that process you need a ton of
34:59 - data so maybe it's not in my case it
35:01 - wouldn't be realistic like what if I
35:03 - wanted to train my own pose net model I
35:05 - guess I would have to what would I do I
35:07 - might take thousands hundreds of
35:09 - thousands of pictures of myself or I
35:12 - might go into like a motion capture
35:13 - studio and like put all sorts of like
35:16 - infrared markers on myself I'd have to
35:18 - create this data set of images with all
35:21 - the corresponding pose estimation points
35:24 - pose point there wouldn't be estimations
35:25 - maybe I would just do this manually with
35:28 - a spreadsheet or click on all the points
35:29 - in these images so this is what is sort
35:32 - of valuable and nice about being able to
35:34 - use something like the pre train pose
35:37 - that model in ml5 is I kind of get the
35:39 - results of that but understanding that
35:41 - full story is super important all right
35:43 - now so hopefully everybody has ml5
35:46 - installed and working anybody have
35:50 - trouble with that please ask in the chat
35:53 - and Halle brine in the chat is making a
35:56 - good point which is you could
35:57 - crowdsource it so crowdsourcing is
35:59 - certainly an excellent way to compile a
36:02 - large data set but you've also got to
36:04 - think about you know how are you crowd
36:07 - sourcing you know are you are you just
36:09 - getting everybody's free labor whatever
36:12 - what is the copyright issues with all of
36:13 - the you know are you allowed to use
36:15 - these images that people are submitting
36:17 - you know are you only getting data from
36:20 - a certain segment
36:20 - people who live in a certain part of the
36:22 - world and you know there's lots of
36:23 - questions or and and I think things to
36:26 - think about in terms of thoughtful and
36:28 - ethical crowdsourcing there okay all
36:37 - right Andre as in the chat says I tried
36:40 - it but it doesn't work so I don't know
36:42 - if that means that your console dot log
36:43 - ml5 gave you an error if that's the case
36:46 - please ask and maybe there are also some
36:48 - moderators in the chat that can help out
36:49 - but I'll try to keep an eye on it okay
36:53 - we got to get moving here I have it even
36:55 - so now here I am oh right why is this
36:58 - confusing so this by the way is written
37:00 - with some slightly different syntax this
37:01 - is written without the p5 library in
37:04 - mind but it also has a video variable so
37:06 - I can actually do excuse me exactly this
37:09 - I'm gonna grab this and I'm gonna I'm
37:14 - going to say let pose net and I'm gonna
37:18 - say now I'm gonna say pose net equals ml
37:23 - v dot i think it's pose net video model
37:27 - ready and let me give myself a little
37:29 - bit more code here model ready is not
37:33 - defined right so this is the line of
37:35 - code now which will basically say I want
37:38 - to create I want to load the pose net
37:41 - model and connect it to this video
37:43 - that's a thing that takes time
37:45 - it actually has to go to a cloud server
37:47 - and retrieve all of the information in
37:51 - that pose net model so this would only
37:53 - work if you're connected to the Internet
37:54 - and also it's giving me an error because
37:56 - what model ready is I mean I could
37:58 - actually like skip that and it's working
38:00 - now working but the reason why I want to
38:04 - add this keyword this this this name
38:07 - model ready here is I want to have a
38:08 - function that tells me this is an event
38:12 - this is a callback it tells me when it's
38:15 - finished loading that model so I can say
38:18 - I could just say console dot log model
38:20 - ready
38:21 - so now as it runs you can see when it
38:24 - loads model dot model ready prints out
38:27 - down here okay
38:28 - so now I have video I have model ready
38:33 - oh no sorry I have video imposed in it
38:36 - both loaded video and post net are both
38:38 - loaded I'm gonna give this a pause to
38:42 - see I'm gonna see if there's any
38:49 - questions I don't see any questions
38:51 - alright so hopefully you have you're
38:52 - following along you have this working
38:53 - the next step is to actually create an
38:57 - event for when pose that has detected a
39:00 - pose wasn't mean so there's a moment
39:02 - it's sitting there pose that is
39:03 - connected to the video they're connected
39:05 - pose was always looking looking at the
39:06 - video and looking at the video right
39:07 - right now there's no pose no pose no
39:09 - pose no pose and a pose pose so I can
39:13 - write a function I'm gonna call it like
39:15 - got poses poses and this is an answer to
39:21 - another question which is can it detect
39:24 - multiple poses and if we go back to this
39:26 - article you can see actually yes pose
39:28 - net can see more than one person at a
39:30 - time now this is a like an added
39:32 - complication that I don't want to have
39:33 - to deal with right now so I'm gonna
39:35 - actually simplify it down to assuming
39:36 - there's only ever one person but you
39:38 - could certainly you'll you'll see some
39:40 - bits and pieces here that would allow
39:41 - you to do that as I continue to code
39:43 - this okay so I'm assuming there's this
39:45 - function called got poses I'm going to
39:47 - say console.log poses and then what I'm
39:52 - gonna say is now I'm gonna let me
39:54 - actually turn off this Auto refresh
39:55 - because it's kind of like reloading it
39:58 - every time I type is a little bit messy
39:59 - for this what I'm doing right now I'm
40:01 - gonna say pose net dot on pose I think
40:04 - this is what I say got poses let's just
40:07 - see if that works okay yes so you can
40:13 - see here what I'm doing this is pretty
40:15 - typical of JavaScript and i'ma hit stop
40:17 - that I create the pose net I load the
40:21 - pose net model by saying ml v dot pose
40:23 - net connected to the video then what I'm
40:25 - saying is hey there's going to be an
40:27 - event this event is a pose event and
40:31 - when a pose is detected the pose that
40:36 - this function got poses will be executed
40:38 - that's the callback and inside this
40:40 - variable called poses will be an array
40:42 - of all of the pose information you can
40:44 - see it's detected
40:45 - three poses two poses two poses right
40:49 - because I'm console logging every time
40:51 - it detects something so in theory maybe
40:54 - there's other kind of events maybe pose
40:56 - net can detect a pose or a something
40:59 - else I think right now probably if we
41:01 - look at the documentation the only
41:03 - current kind of eventually is the pose
41:05 - event but you can see that that this is
41:10 - like a model by which there could be
41:12 - other events as well okay so let's take
41:15 - a look at this now I'm gonna I'm gonna
41:16 - move this back up look this is
41:18 - everything it's detecting amazingly like
41:20 - I am just I am many oh you know I'm many
41:23 - people I don't know why but we can look
41:25 - at this and we could say look two
41:26 - objects right it's detected two objects
41:29 - the first object is a pose with a
41:32 - skeleton let's look in the pose score
41:35 - now this is super important this is
41:36 - super important machine learning models
41:38 - in addition to making some sort of
41:41 - prediction like where's the pose is it a
41:43 - cat or a dog they often also produce all
41:46 - this is done numerically so it can
41:48 - produce a confidence score up
41:49 - probability of it really being the thing
41:51 - it thinks it is so this is actually kind
41:53 - of low right it's only 38% sure that
41:58 - it's a that that it actually detected a
42:00 - pose and then in here inside here key
42:04 - points this is what we really care about
42:06 - so this is the pose that detected this
42:09 - is how confident it was and then look at
42:11 - this these are all these key points what
42:14 - are those key points well guess what
42:17 - here is a nice this this needs to be on
42:20 - the ml5 website but it's not at present
42:22 - but this is a mapping right there the
42:25 - pose net model is trained to find how
42:28 - many are here look that's number 16 how
42:30 - many are here say it with me because
42:33 - start counting from 0 right
42:35 - there are 17 key points let's go back
42:37 - and look here zero through 16 17 key
42:42 - points for example zero is the nose so
42:45 - if I go back here and I look here this
42:48 - is actually the confidence that have
42:49 - found the nose right super confident it
42:52 - found my nose let's see how confident it
42:54 - is it found my leg right it couldn't see
42:55 - my leg like left knee which is
42:58 - 13 so if I go down to 13 right left knee
43:01 - look it's 1% confident - found the knee
43:04 - right because I can't even see the knee
43:05 - so that's kind of interesting so we can
43:07 - see here that's its score for the nose
43:10 - it's part is the nose and then its
43:12 - position this is the pixel location as
43:15 - to where it guessed that nose is so
43:18 - guess what what I'm gonna do now is I'm
43:21 - gonna do something very simple I'm gonna
43:25 - put this down here I am going to make a
43:27 - variable called nose X I'm gonna set it
43:31 - to zero and I make another row called
43:32 - knows why and I set it to zero I am
43:35 - going to draw fill 250 this is a setting
43:40 - a red color then I'm gonna draw a circle
43:42 - at nose X knows why I'm gonna make the
43:46 - circle 100 pixels wide no diet you can
43:50 - see there it is there's my nose and what
43:54 - I'm gonna do now is I'm going to say
43:56 - nose x equals and this is going to be
43:59 - really crazy
44:00 - let's hit stop for a second and let's
44:04 - look at one of these poses okay so poses
44:07 - is an array I want the first pose zero
44:13 - then in here I need to actually go and
44:16 - look I mean let me give myself a little
44:18 - bit more room here I need to go and look
44:23 - at the pose so I'm in zero value to look
44:27 - at the pose so I need to say dot pose
44:30 - then inside of pose I want to look at
44:33 - the key points dot key points and then
44:38 - inside of key points I want zero because
44:41 - I'm looking for the nose and inside zero
44:45 - I know why it's I want the position and
44:52 - inside position looks sorry I don't know
44:58 - why this is keep scrolling I want the X
45:00 - okay dot X and now I want to do the same
45:07 - thing for the Y
45:12 - now let's see what happens let's now run
45:15 - this look at that it is tracking my nose
45:24 - nose I can come back and pick up my nose
45:27 - what Oh hold on oh why do I get an error
45:30 - why do I get an error what just happened
45:32 - I was working that it stopped it's no
45:35 - longer detecting poses I don't know
45:37 - what's going on that was interesting so
45:40 - I think there's an issue here I don't
45:43 - know why I didn't get an error but
45:45 - there's there's definitely a problem
45:46 - this could actually you could see it
45:48 - stopped right here technically this
45:51 - callback could be called when it detects
45:54 - zero poses right it can actually be
45:58 - running and it validates is greater than
46:08 - zero like I want to make sure there's at
46:10 - least one pose so I'm gonna put a little
46:13 - if statement there and do I not have my
46:18 - semicolons I'm gonna put a little if
46:22 - statement there to make sure and I also
46:23 - just gonna comment out this console.log
46:25 - poses because I don't really it's not
46:27 - really that meaningful me any more
46:28 - all right here we go my clown nose is
46:33 - way too big there we go hi it's me clown
46:44 - nose so now you can see I can leave and
46:47 - it I can pick it back up again yeah so
46:50 - this is interesting if I did this way if
46:52 - I was tracking my right hand for example
46:54 - I might be able to like have this idea
46:56 - of like sort of tossing and aside and
46:58 - picking it back up but I can go down
47:00 - here I can enter here really let me come
47:04 - come come to me little nose there we go
47:07 - and actually incidentally notice how
47:09 - it's kind of jiggly so the pose the
47:12 - estimation has had a lot of noise in it
47:14 - it's not gonna be you know and I I move
47:16 - around there's noise in the camera so
47:18 - one thing that I would like to add to
47:19 - this and there's there's a bunch of
47:21 - things I want to add to this but really
47:23 - quickly I am going to now
47:24 - change something and I'm gonna use a
47:26 - function called lurk lurk uh-oh as an
47:38 - hour past know I've got a little bit of
47:40 - time I'm going to write this function
47:46 - here lurk lerp is a function that takes
47:53 - three arguments 1 2 3 this is value 1
48:00 - this is value 2 and this is a percentage
48:05 - really a number that ranges between 0
48:09 - and 1 I'm sure you could actually use a
48:11 - number that's less than 0 greater than 1
48:12 - to get interesting results but
48:14 - conceptually it's important that this
48:16 - number is between 0 & 1 so in other
48:18 - words if I put the number 6 and the
48:24 - number 10 and the number point 5 what
48:28 - this does is it says ok let's think
48:30 - about a number line with 6 here and 10
48:35 - here and let's find the number that's
48:37 - 50% of the way that's halfway this would
48:40 - actually give us back the value 8 so
48:45 - lerp which stands for linear
48:47 - interpolation is just finding the point
48:50 - in between two other points along the
48:53 - line it's linear interpolation the this
48:56 - has a fancy name but that's all it's
48:57 - doing it's saying I have a number line I
48:58 - have the first number and the second
49:00 - number and I want to be somewhere in
49:01 - between so the reason why I can use this
49:03 - effectively is right now I'm saying
49:05 - knows X equals the actual like pose net
49:10 - knows X value but what I actually could
49:15 - do is I could say you know what
49:16 - don't set this directly equal to it
49:18 - actually lerp it maybe 90% of the way 10
49:25 - percent of the way 50 percent of the way
49:26 - I'm actually plugged into using a number
49:28 - like point two twenty percent of the way
49:30 - so this will smooth the value instead of
49:33 - having it jump immediately to the new
49:34 - location
49:35 - it just has slides a little bit there so
49:37 - if there's a lot of noise it's going to
49:38 - to stay around the same spot so let's
49:40 - actually now go ahead and use the lerp
49:42 - function and the way that I'm going to
49:45 - do that is I'm going to actually create
49:47 - a separate variable here called X and a
49:50 - separate variable here called Y maybe
49:51 - I'll call it like new new X and new Y
49:56 - and then I can say knows x equals lerp
50:02 - its previous value with the new value
50:06 - 20% of the way there and knows y lerp
50:11 - its previous value with the new value
50:13 - 20% of the way there and now let's run
50:16 - this and see what happens
50:18 - look how it's like it's like blagging
50:21 - but it's smooth and what's fun about
50:24 - this if I move over here and then I can
50:26 - go underneath and then I'm gonna come
50:31 - back over here come to me nose there we
50:34 - go so I don't know what the appropriate
50:35 - value might be like I might actually say
50:38 - like I really just want I want to do it
50:40 - like 50% cuz I just want to like I don't
50:42 - want it to be so laggy but I want to
50:44 - smooth it a little bit so you can see
50:46 - here now maybe it's a little less
50:47 - jittery but the same idea okay so I
50:51 - should pause right and I meant to pause
50:52 - after I just got the nose to see people
50:54 - would get this working so let's see let
50:56 - me pause for a minute and let's see if
50:58 - you can get this working let's see if
51:04 - you have questions hold on I'm have a
51:06 - chat going over here
51:09 - right happy antlers for a holiday-themed
51:12 - coding challenge I think I might do this
51:14 - as like a coding challenge this is meant
51:17 - to be more like a one-hour tutorial
51:19 - activity so I'm mostly gonna stop I'm
51:21 - gonna show you one more thing that I
51:22 - think is kind of important
51:24 - I'm mostly gonna stop here but what but
51:30 - I think I would like to do a coding
51:32 - challenge where I actually like just go
51:33 - through this really quickly and like
51:34 - draw some we're designing thingies
51:36 - design you a technical term for taking
51:39 - this further as draw designing thingies
51:41 - okay
51:46 - so the idea is now you know that you
51:51 - would take this and and you have
51:53 - creative ideas you thought of drawing
51:55 - antlers or a top hat or earrings or you
51:59 - know a mask all sorts of possibilities
52:06 - right Austin writes it would be fun to
52:08 - use this to make a puppet like make a
52:11 - vector character and use Poe's net to
52:13 - control the facial features with your
52:14 - face yes absolutely
52:16 - so you could puppeteer something right
52:18 - there's no reason that you need to even
52:20 - see the video at all you could create a
52:22 - like a physics-based system that's a
52:23 - puppet and actually just almost like a
52:25 - marionette move it around with your body
52:29 - okay so okay seeing lots of great
52:40 - suggestions people are very marveling at
52:42 - my magic cup my amazing magic cup we
52:48 - will show you why it is amazingly magic
52:51 - in this is green here it is somehow
52:53 - purple over here this is very confusing
52:56 - all right all right so here's the thing
52:58 - my
52:59 - one thing about my clown nose is if I'm
53:01 - all the way back let me to move this
53:02 - computer away I'm gonna do one more
53:03 - thing
53:04 - one thing about my clown nose is if I'm
53:06 - all the way back here it's really big on
53:08 - my face and if I'm all the way up here
53:10 - it's really small that's not what a real
53:12 - clown nose would do it would be the same
53:14 - size how could I estimate distance from
53:18 - the camera think about this let's come
53:24 - back to the whiteboard the pose net is
53:27 - us has 17 key points there's eyes nose I
53:33 - believe on the face there's these two
53:35 - eyes nose to ears maybe there's more
53:39 - think about it if this is what it's
53:42 - detecting when it's at a certain
53:44 - distance that might see it this way when
53:46 - it's at another distance it might see it
53:48 - this way everything's going to be closer
53:49 - together so the distance between like
53:52 - the nose and your ear is going to be
53:54 - bigger when you're closer to the camera
53:56 - and smaller when you're further away so
53:58 - why not
54:00 - you have to calculate that too let's go
54:02 - back to here and that's let's use
54:05 - throughout the eyes since it's the next
54:06 - one and so I'm gonna say I guess I need
54:12 - to like lerp all of these things
54:13 - Wow all right let's add let I and I X
54:18 - let I Y and this is technically the like
54:22 - the right the left eye is it the left I
54:27 - remember well where was I left eye is
54:30 - number one so left eye ILX ily
54:35 - set all these values to zero as well so
54:42 - I'm going to add two points for that
54:44 - then I am going to say new of I'm gonna
54:56 - call this NX for nose ex4 eye I don't
55:01 - like what I'm doing here at variable
55:03 - naming is a thing so we've got the nose
55:07 - is key point 0 the eye the left eye is
55:10 - key point 1 and then I can also just
55:13 - lurk the now I have eye LX ILX
55:21 - ily to lerp IL x2 ily with this is NX
55:28 - and x and y hi e x ey so I made this
55:34 - sort of a little overly complex because
55:35 - of this extra lerp step but basically
55:37 - I'm getting now the left eye and the
55:39 - nose and just to be sure about this
55:44 - let's just draw the left eye as well and
55:50 - now you can imagine how I might do
55:52 - glasses right this would be breezy ting
55:54 - I could do a circles with no fill or
55:56 - squares with a line in between so many
55:58 - possibilities that would be a nice
55:59 - exercise for you to try let's just make
56:01 - that blue really quickly so now we
56:04 - should see that I have whoa that's an
56:10 - interesting eye what is going on I must
56:12 - have written
56:13 - I must have something wrong there must
56:14 - be a mistake in my code right
56:16 - il X ily ah look at this
56:21 - I have position X twice line 22 line 22
56:26 - I see it so let me fix that and let me
56:30 - run it again we should say yes there we
56:34 - go so we can see I have both it's
56:36 - tracking my eye as best it can and my
56:39 - nose if I go really close to the camera
56:41 - you'll see how those are two different
56:43 - distinct distance between nose x knows y
56:46 - IL x and IL y and why don't we just try
56:52 - making the clown nose the diameter of
56:55 - the cloud nose exactly that distance it
56:57 - kind of makes sense right because if you
57:00 - think about it
57:00 - I mean I could use some math to it or a
57:03 - mapping to it but this is my nose and
57:05 - this is my eye and this is the distance
57:08 - this value right being the diameter
57:11 - would be you know something like this
57:13 - covering the nose but not covering the
57:15 - eye so what I could actually BLET so
57:17 - let's actually try that and run it and
57:20 - we will see small nose the nose the
57:26 - clown nose size is proportioned to the
57:32 - distance between my nose and the eye
57:38 - all right so this is this ends this one
57:42 - hour one hour hour of code tutorial we
57:47 - now have what have we done we've we're
57:51 - using the p5 web editor we've used p5 to
57:54 - get the web cam we've loaded the post
57:56 - net model with pose net with ml 5 sorry
58:00 - we've connected the video with pose net
58:04 - we have an event for whenever it detects
58:07 - suppose we find the noses position the
58:11 - eyes position we use lerp to dual add a
58:14 - little bit of smoothing and then in the
58:17 - draw loop we're drawing a circle where
58:19 - the nose is and the circle size is tied
58:22 - is tied to the distance between the nose
58:25 - and the eye so what could you do now so
58:27 - many possibilities right could you put
58:28 - glasses could you put a beard one thing
58:30 - I should say is you should remember that
58:32 - you don't actually have to draw stuff
58:35 - exactly at the position right what if
58:38 - you wanted in my example that I think I
58:40 - showed here at the beginning you know if
58:42 - I were to take this a little further
58:43 - whoops ah I'm in the wrong place if I
58:48 - were to oh come back to me oh this is
58:53 - the actual video of this is so difficult
58:56 - wow those are my socks turn you lose
58:59 - sight you just wanted to get that visual
59:00 - reference I will find it look at all
59:05 - these things on my Twitter there it is
59:08 - so for example there's no key point a
59:11 - forehead or a top of head or left
59:15 - forehead or right forehead but if I know
59:17 - where the eyes are and I know where the
59:18 - nose is I can figure out how to move
59:20 - something up based on those two
59:22 - positions to sit on top of the head so
59:24 - that's something you could think about
59:25 - what is a way that you could create a
59:28 - fun playful mask clown nose hat whatever
59:32 - on top of somebody's face using p5 and
59:36 - ml5 and I'm sure you'll have other
59:38 - creative ideas okay so I just want to a
59:46 - check check the chat for any last
59:51 - djinns oh where can you get this code
59:53 - right now so if I hit save I'm gonna
59:56 - this link this URL you can actually just
59:59 - start from my code itself let me just do
60:03 - this real quick
60:04 - someone could paste this into the chat
60:06 - actually I probably could but you have
60:09 - to be a moderator to paste a link in the
60:11 - chat but this is now the URL when once
60:14 - this gets archived this link will just
60:16 - be in the video's description
60:17 - but this is the put this down here this
60:20 - is the the URL to the code right now
60:23 - cover your nose and see what happens
60:27 - so interestingly enough right this isn't
60:31 - actually doing you know the way machine
60:33 - learning works is a topic for a long
60:36 - discussion but unlike some type of
60:39 - algorithm that is actually maybe looking
60:41 - for like color or some contrast ratio or
60:46 - some type of like edge detection to find
60:48 - where the nose is me putting my hands
60:51 - here it still could kind of estimate the
60:53 - pose it's not the nose it's not getting
60:55 - it super accurate obviously it's jumping
60:57 - around or if I put this
60:59 - train whistle on my nose but it still
61:02 - pretty much got it because it's making a
61:04 - best guess based on all of the training
61:07 - data and the training data is noisy
61:09 - messy weird data with probably like
61:11 - people with covering their nose and yet
61:13 - it still had a nose position perhaps in
61:14 - that training data so it actually still
61:16 - does a pretty reasonable job making a
61:17 - guess okay I thank you for people to me
61:24 - actually I think I can click over here
61:25 - and a woven coast I'm just gonna show
61:27 - one of them woven coasts has now posted
61:31 - that URL all right
61:33 - so Oh Bruno I don't know if you don't
61:40 - mind this Bruno has made crazy eyes well
61:42 - I would love try to make googly eyes
61:44 - right where the eyes like jiggle around
61:45 - as we move your head but let's look at
61:47 - Bruno's if I go to editor I this is
61:51 - going to take me a minute to type it in
61:52 - because I don't have the chat but this
61:58 - shouldn't be too bad capital B why RQL
62:02 - six
62:03 - you je let's see what we get here oh oh
62:08 - so sad what did I get wrong here
62:10 - Bruno ru CH IG ABY r q oh that's a seven
62:21 - let's look at this yes googly eyes oh
62:26 - that is awesome
62:26 - so already I really would love to see
62:30 - lots of examples of this if you don't
62:32 - know what a good what's a good hashtag
62:33 - for this if that you could share on
62:35 - Twitter or maybe or little animations
62:39 - really surprisingly fun is it scaled so
62:43 - you're gonna have to I would say oh no
62:44 - it is scaled oh my no no it's not scaled
62:46 - it's the same size right so that might
62:47 - be something you want to add is scaling
62:49 - that's really fun so please share these
62:54 - well I'm so excited to see things that
62:55 - people make so I I would I'm going to do
62:59 - something a little bit strange I'm gonna
63:01 - continue live-streaming but I want this
63:04 - video to live on its own as this like
63:07 - one hour video so I'm gonna actually
63:09 - turn off the livestream and create a new
63:12 - event on YouTube and then I'm gonna
63:14 - stream to that so I don't know if this
63:16 - is like a bad idea in terms of like
63:17 - losing the audience but I don't that's
63:20 - fine with me go please go about your day
63:21 - but I'm gonna come back and maybe do
63:23 - like one or two other things p5 mask
63:26 - coating faces alright let's do Co
63:29 - decoding faces is good I don't want to
63:32 - say masks because we could do coating
63:37 - pose net but that's when we should do
63:39 - coating pose net well the reason we
63:43 - don't say mask is I don't want to imply
63:45 - that what you make has to be a mask is
63:47 - it I'm sabores asked is it possible to
63:49 - add a 3d mask so the pose net model is
63:52 - making no three guesses about depth this
63:56 - is why I had to extrapolate depth based
63:58 - on the distance between the eye and the
64:00 - nose there I think if you probably look
64:04 - into current there's something called
64:06 - dense pose which is another machine
64:07 - learning model I'm sure there are people
64:10 - actively working on extrapolating the
64:13 - from a to now remember this is a 2d
64:14 - image extrapolating depth from
64:17 - but certainly if I had some type of
64:18 - depth sensor like a Kinect camera or the
64:22 - Intel I think it's called realsense or
64:24 - something camera there are cameras that
64:26 - using infrared can actually measure
64:27 - depth but could you extrapolate that
64:30 - this is hard that you have to have a
64:31 - training set for this right so how do
64:32 - you have a training set that has flat 2d
64:34 - images with all the depth information
64:38 - okay clarify let's try a coding pose net
64:43 - is boring
64:45 - snappy five chat that's kind of
64:48 - something I'm not good at these hash tag
64:55 - things now this videos gonna be like 20
64:56 - minutes longer as I try to figure out a
64:57 - hash tag code your face I like coding
65:03 - faces actually I mean I don't know if
65:06 - that's accurate but it's sort of fun um
65:08 - you could also just tag at coding train
65:11 - or I think it's I think it's at the
65:13 - coding train or at Schiffman is what I
65:16 - actually see but like coding train faces
65:21 - why don't we could also just do we could
65:28 - do coding train faces is that googly
65:32 - eyes coding face Austin is typing maybe
65:37 - Austin's gonna have a great suggestion
65:38 - here whose videos like way longer just
65:40 - discussing the hash tag
65:49 - [Music]
65:54 - coding phases is cool there already is a
66:12 - little bit of use from May 2015 of
66:15 - coding phases all right we're gonna go
66:17 - with coding phases and I'm gonna shut
66:20 - off this live stream I'm gonna show off
66:27 - this live stream but I am coming right
66:29 - back it's just gonna be I'm gonna have
66:30 - to spin up a new event with a different
66:33 - title I just want this to like stand
66:35 - alone to the next and so we can change
66:38 - our mind later but for now I'm going
66:39 - with coding phases all right so hold on
66:45 - I'm hitting stop streaming goodbye
66:46 - everybody but I'll be right back but
66:47 - this is the end of my hour of code
66:49 - tutorial i hope and i hope to see things
66:52 - that people have made and i hope you
66:55 - found this interesting and useful thank
66:57 - you for watching and good bye
66:58 - [Music]
