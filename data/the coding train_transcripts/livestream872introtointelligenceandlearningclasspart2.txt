00:00 - oh ho I'm back I wearing a microphone
00:04 - yes okay I think you know I think's
00:08 - going on here
00:11 - someone is some mystical force of the
00:14 - universe is looking at me and saying oh
00:18 - machine learning like to me this is what
00:22 - felt like happening I was about to say
00:24 - I'm going to unlock all of the mysteries
00:26 - and wonder of machine learning and so I
00:32 - think someone is I think it was like
00:33 - literally saved by the bell there so
00:38 - today is really I have to apologize to
00:41 - all of you viewers now things are really
00:43 - quite messed up for me in terms of my
00:45 - schedule I
00:46 - I was streaming for about seven minutes
00:48 - oops this camera's not on and I think it
00:54 - was over here talking about kind of
00:57 - machine learning in the broad sense and
00:59 - the thing that I was about to do was
01:01 - transition over to my syllabus and start
01:04 - to talk about why I have some of these
01:07 - topics here in the first week and then I
01:09 - was going to show you some examples of
01:11 - those and just kind of give you a
01:12 - landscape of stuff that I plan to start
01:16 - next week and then the fire alarm went
01:18 - off there was no fire as far as I know
01:20 - in fact I really don't even want to
01:26 - admit this but I have to be I have to be
01:29 - true I have to be honest the fire alarm
01:31 - was actually in the building next door
01:33 - so technically speaking the floor that
01:36 - I'm on it's two buildings that are a
01:38 - joint you can walk between the buildings
01:39 - or say hallway but technically the fire
01:42 - alarm was the building next door now
01:44 - it's quite loud and I could hear it you
01:46 - could probably hear it too
01:47 - and so I thought I should leave and you
01:50 - know on my way out I was just stopping
01:52 - by the fourth floor to just sort of
01:55 - check and see if people were leaving
01:57 - there too maybe I'd go out and grab some
01:58 - lunch with some folks and then ones just
02:00 - sitting around with their desks cuz
02:02 - there's no fire going off because I'm on
02:05 - that floor can't there is no walkway
02:07 - between the two buildings so I got
02:09 - confused so maybe the fire alarm is over
02:11 - and I came back upstairs
02:13 - I'm still going off some people said oh
02:16 - you don't have to leave because it's the
02:18 - building next door I don't know then I
02:19 - it was a really loud fire alarm so I'm
02:21 - not gonna just sit around and do this
02:22 - live stream when this fire alarm is
02:24 - going off you know if a fire is in the
02:25 - building next door I think it's still
02:27 - kind of a problem so then I went out for
02:32 - a little bit and and then I got caught
02:34 - in a couple conversations I was maybe to
02:36 - get something to eat which I didn't do
02:37 - so I don't know some time passed and I
02:40 - came back and the fire alarm is not
02:42 - going off anymore and everybody's in
02:44 - this building so it seems like things
02:46 - are okay unfortunately what that has
02:50 - done to my schedule is that you know I
02:52 - was I was hoping to leave about now or a
02:55 - half an hour from now and you know and I
03:00 - don't really have the flexibility right
03:02 - now to first of all so I eaten something
03:06 - but I have a lunch appointment to go to
03:08 - and so I like my energy and my brain is
03:14 - a little bit melted so I'm trying to
03:16 - think
03:16 - I've let's say I'm gonna be here for 15
03:18 - or 30 minutes let's look let's let me
03:21 - finish up what I was saying about
03:22 - machine learning and which is that and
03:27 - and I probably shouldn't do this because
03:28 - if I'm gonna do any look let me finish
03:31 - up my that thought from before because
03:32 - it's in my head so one of the I know
03:35 - what I was doing when the fire alarm
03:37 - went off oh I think I made the fire
03:40 - alarm go off by doing this let's see if
03:42 - I can do it again
03:44 - cuz here's the thing this is I don't
03:47 - understand these things really but but
03:52 - I'm gonna try to teach them and there's
03:54 - all this new research and I go in I read
03:56 - these web pages of my eyes glaze over
03:58 - and they were all into the back of my
03:59 - head and then I you know I start to get
04:01 - this like pain in my side and the feels
04:03 - like this like this like uncomfortable
04:07 - feeling in my chest you know reading all
04:09 - these papers and stuff about neural
04:11 - networks but oh I said it did the fire
04:14 - is there something going on I feel like
04:16 - when I said neural network had caused
04:17 - the fire to come off it was saving me
04:19 - but this is one of the core this is
04:21 - certainly one of the things that I get
04:23 - asked about the most oh can you do a
04:24 - neural network
04:25 - coding challenge can you explain how a
04:26 - neural network works and I do actually
04:28 - I'm joking around to some extent because
04:30 - I do have some examples already about
04:32 - this idea of this thing called a
04:34 - perceptron which I will build and
04:35 - program from scratch when we get to this
04:37 - week but one of the things about a
04:39 - neural network is and I'm looking for my
04:44 - I'm kind of a little out of whack here
04:46 - where is my eraser here it is so one way
04:55 - of thinking about a neural network is
05:01 - inputs and outputs maybe there are some
05:05 - inputs like maybe there are four inputs
05:07 - like maybe we are going to send in some
05:10 - information about a flower what color is
05:14 - it
05:14 - how many petals how tall does it grow no
05:18 - kind of thing these are sort of values
05:20 - that we're going to send into the neural
05:22 - network and then there might be some
05:24 - output which is or multiple outputs
05:27 - which you know the probability of it
05:30 - being a certain kind of flower whether
05:31 - it's the sunflower or a daisy or a lily
05:33 - whatever kind of flower you might think
05:35 - about and then in between there are all
05:38 - these things that are you know these
05:40 - inputs and then there's neurons and
05:42 - there's information goes here then it
05:43 - goes here then maybe it goes here and it
05:45 - goes here it goes here there's this
05:46 - interconnected web of neurons the
05:50 - information flows this is called a
05:52 - feed-forward Network because the
05:53 - information is flowing through it
05:55 - feed-forward and all this math happens
05:57 - in here so at some point I'm going to
06:00 - come back and look at this more closely
06:03 - and look at the different pieces of some
06:05 - of the calculations that happen in here
06:07 - and what kinds of things you can feed in
06:09 - what kinds of things you can pull out
06:11 - but the thing that I thought would be
06:13 - useful is kind of like a warm-up to the
06:15 - course is looking at graph graph systems
06:20 - so for example a kind of classic
06:23 - computer science algorithm is something
06:25 - called a binary search tree which I
06:28 - could draw like this
06:34 - and the arrows are entirely necessary
06:38 - because it's not anyway so you get the
06:41 - idea of this idea of a tree with a root
06:43 - node that has two children that each
06:45 - have two children a left and right
06:47 - binary because it only has a left and a
06:48 - right you could you know I did some
06:51 - videos on the traveling salesperson
06:52 - problem a while back where maybe you
06:55 - have a bunch of cities and you have to
06:58 - figure out what is the most efficient
07:00 - path to you know make it through all the
07:02 - cities that's the shortest this is also
07:05 - a graph system what if you had a subway
07:08 - map and you want to get from this
07:09 - station to this station and there are
07:11 - all these different possible lines and
07:13 - all these other possible stations and
07:15 - they're all interconnected in strange
07:17 - ways how would you find the shortest or
07:19 - the route that takes the least amount of
07:21 - time I looked at something called a star
07:24 - which is an algorithm for looking at a
07:26 - graph and sort of solving your way
07:27 - through the graph there's Dijkstra's
07:29 - algorithm I hope I'm pronouncing that
07:30 - correctly
07:31 - there's breadth-first search and
07:32 - depth-first search so this is where and
07:35 - I wanted to start as a warm-up because
07:37 - these are network based there's two
07:39 - reasons one is these are network based
07:42 - systems and if we can program these
07:45 - systems it's going to give us some clues
07:46 - to what kind of concepts we'll need to
07:50 - program a neural network you know
07:51 - replace the subway map with input and
07:54 - output neurons and neurons and
07:56 - connections all in between that's item
07:59 - number one the item number two the
08:01 - reason number two is that I had wrote
08:04 - this word called illusion I think this
08:11 - might be it for me everybody no longer
08:14 - is thinking about things in a way that
08:17 - makes sense that I can explain
08:19 - it's about illusion correctly I guess
08:22 - spelling isn't the worst thing to get
08:24 - wrong I ll us IO n pretty sure that's
08:27 - right
08:28 - this kind of illusion of intelligence so
08:30 - what if you think about some of my
08:33 - examples about autonomous agents you
08:36 - have this vehicle that's moving around
08:37 - the screen maybe it's seeking a target
08:39 - what if it learns to traverse a binary
08:43 - tree or what if it learns the try
08:45 - the almost efficient solution to the
08:47 - traveling salesperson problem so can we
08:49 - create this appearance of software
08:53 - simulated creatures that move about a
08:55 - two or three dimensional space and that
08:58 - are in any other neural network might be
08:59 - a good way to train it to like not hit
09:01 - obstacles and this is something called
09:03 - there's a technique called reinforcement
09:05 - learning and cue acute learning
09:07 - algorithm that I hope to look at later
09:08 - but even just in a sort of basic way
09:11 - what if we had a lot of nodes and the
09:12 - agency to steer around those nodes so
09:14 - this is kind of where I'm starting the
09:17 - chat and see if anybody is listening to
09:21 - me okay so I so I think I'm just going
09:25 - to talk about this briefly so I'm gonna
09:27 - clone this repo and I've started doing
09:30 - some work on some simple examples let me
09:34 - go to terminal here and we go to the
09:38 - desktop and git clone so for those of
09:41 - you who might not be familiar with
09:43 - github github is a website where you can
09:46 - store repositories of information most
09:49 - people use it to store repositories of
09:51 - source code and cloning is the act of
09:53 - downloading the information from github
09:55 - and I could have just I could have just
09:57 - gone here to do download zip or there's
09:59 - also like a desktop application but I'm
10:01 - gonna use the command line to paste the
10:03 - URL for this repo and then I'm going to
10:05 - go into the repo and I am going to open
10:11 - the repo in Adam so I can look at some
10:14 - of the code and I'm also going to run
10:17 - oops I'm going to what's that command
10:20 - okay maybe that's it command K clears
10:22 - the terminal my whole life has now
10:25 - changed I'm going to run a local server
10:28 - and let's take a look at some of the
10:31 - examples so this is the stuff I'm going
10:33 - to do some of these as coding challenges
10:35 - and been working on these examples this
10:37 - week I haven't gotten very far but for
10:39 - example let me just a lot of these are
10:42 - wrong there's mistakes in them but let
10:45 - me look at this for a second oh so this
10:47 - is this is actually Oh where's my crop
10:50 - so this is actually a JavaScript version
10:53 - of an example from this book called
10:58 - rocking algorithms an illustrated guide
11:00 - for programmers and other curious people
11:02 - by Aditya our Bhargava and so my slack
11:10 - chat is disconnected I don't know why it
11:15 - is sorry everybody in slack I that
11:19 - computer's disconnected so if you're
11:22 - listening so this this particular
11:24 - scenario is a doing a search to find let
11:29 - me let me actually there is a look at
11:32 - this this computer lost its internet
11:33 - connection I'm gonna have to deal with
11:34 - that in a little bit a second okay so if
11:36 - I go to the code for a second and I go
11:39 - to this one what I've done in this
11:44 - particular example I'm going to come
11:45 - back and actually program some of these
11:46 - next week as coding challenges or sooner
11:49 - the next week if I can and these names
11:51 - are I'm using these names because I want
11:53 - to emphasize that this particular the
11:56 - code doesn't come from this book but I
11:57 - wrote the code while reading the chapter
12:00 - of this book even though I have some
12:01 - mistakes in the code that I've since
12:03 - realized so ok so I'm only looking at
12:09 - the YouTube chat right now just for
12:11 - everybody's reference so okay so what
12:14 - you can see here is that I'm creating a
12:16 - bunch of notes you Bob Alice Claire uh
12:19 - nourish so these are nodes like this you
12:30 - Bob Claire right and then these nodes
12:36 - have various connections for example I
12:39 - can connect myself to Alice Bob and
12:42 - Claire so if I come back you know what I
12:47 - really need is I need a data set of
12:49 - Kevin Bacon movies that's what I need
12:52 - for this so U is B is connected to
12:55 - Claire it's connected to Alice I can't
12:57 - remember if I was connected to Bob but
12:59 - you get the idea here maybe Bob is
13:00 - connected to a new
13:02 - and I'm connected to Bob and inertia is
13:04 - connected to so named Tom and Claire is
13:07 - connected to Tom so the idea here is
13:09 - let's say this was a social network and
13:11 - these connections were whether your
13:13 - friends on Facebook or you follow each
13:15 - other on Twitter how could you find the
13:17 - degrees of separation how could you find
13:19 - the shortest path if each step is one
13:22 - step and we could plainly see if I want
13:24 - to get from myself to Tom here that the
13:27 - shortest path is you me I should just
13:31 - write me me declare to time I could get
13:34 - there by going from me to Bob to an urge
13:37 - to Tom but the shortest path this only
13:40 - requires two steps so the this is that
13:43 - business you know in my mind in the
13:46 - broadest sense artificial intelligence a
13:48 - computer algorithm is solving a problem
13:51 - in an intelligent manner to come up with
13:53 - some optimal solution and so this is
13:55 - where the class is going to start this
13:56 - also has the has the advantage of a
13:58 - couple things one is there some
13:59 - interesting visual outcomes nap spaces
14:02 - maze spaces that steering ages can move
14:05 - around and the example that I'm using is
14:08 - using breadth-first search although I
14:10 - think I might have had an error in the
14:12 - code and might have made it more depth
14:13 - first search by accident so I'm gonna
14:15 - look at all this stuff and this is what
14:16 - I'm coming back next week to don't get
14:18 - more closely okay let's see all right so
14:22 - that's one example here's another let's
14:25 - look at some of these other examples and
14:27 - this by the way that one thing that's
14:29 - okay
14:29 - so anybody wants to come by the way
14:32 - first of all I would be thrilled for the
14:35 - world that's out there watching to
14:37 - contribute to this repository so these
14:39 - examples are in progress here's a major
14:41 - issue with this example I picked them
14:43 - I'm doing a visualization of all these
14:45 - connections I just put them all at
14:47 - random locations which is kind of
14:48 - terrible like they really should maybe
14:50 - be in some sort of order that would be
14:52 - make it easy to look at and see and I
14:54 - could do a force directed graph that's
14:56 - kind of a big complicated thing but even
14:58 - just kind of having rows so that's
15:00 - that's a little challenge or visualize
15:01 - in a different way if anyone wants to
15:02 - kind of help out with some of these
15:04 - examples let's go this is incorrect I
15:10 - should fix this right now thank you to
15:12 - me I am so me let me try to get this
15:14 - other computer's internet
15:15 - working again maybe it's the NYU turn
15:20 - Wi-Fi off turn Wi-Fi on let's see if
15:23 - that does anything
15:24 - Oh what is the repository called
15:27 - I don't know if anyone can post this
15:28 - into the it came back if anyone could
15:32 - know attorney ins okay so this is the
15:39 - repository
15:40 - Schiffman slash all this nonsense up
15:42 - here screenshot that or someone can post
15:45 - it who can post links in the chat okay
15:48 - so here's something this is called this
15:53 - isn't a demonstration of what's supposed
15:56 - to be breath breadth-first search trying
15:59 - to get from this Green Dot
16:01 - to this Green Dot and every time i
16:03 - refresh ah there we go it got there it
16:05 - finds in the shortest path the fewest
16:08 - number of steps and which things are
16:10 - connected in this grid or random so we
16:13 - can see it try to solve and it solved
16:15 - that one and we can see this now here's
16:17 - the thing one of the key fundamental
16:20 - pieces of a breadth-first search is this
16:23 - idea of a queue I've got this queue a
16:26 - line the queue is if I were to
16:27 - demonstrate it with just myself I'm
16:30 - going to queue up to ring the bell
16:33 - yay my turns over so now the next person
16:40 - comes up rings the bell so who the first
16:45 - person in line is the first person who
16:46 - rings the bell and then the last person
16:48 - in line has to wait until they become
16:50 - the first person to line so what what is
16:53 - what it's just like lining up to buy
16:55 - tickets for something which is the
16:56 - opposite of a stack which is this thing
16:58 - that you pile things on and then you
17:00 - pull things off so the last thing in so
17:02 - in a queue the first thing in I could
17:04 - diagram this but anyway the whole point
17:06 - of this
17:06 - it needs a cute let's go look at the
17:07 - source code and I'm gonna go to this one
17:10 - that's BFS grid animate and the
17:13 - algorithm is here in this draw function
17:17 - and look at this it's saying Q dot
17:19 - length is greater than zero node equals
17:22 - Q dot pop now here's the thing I just I
17:24 - I made up a variable called Q because I
17:27 - want it to be a data
17:28 - structure of a cube but what is it
17:30 - actually it's just an array so I didn't
17:32 - actually implement kind of queue data
17:35 - structure and an array I should an array
17:45 - so here's the data structure we want
17:51 - this is the queue right so if I add
17:55 - something to the queue it goes here at
18:00 - the end and if I take something out of
18:02 - the queue then it goes there it's taken
18:08 - from the beginning so pop pull something
18:11 - out push put something at the end but an
18:13 - array in JavaScript if I just use the
18:16 - default if I use push push the push
18:18 - function adds an element to the end and
18:21 - the pop function takes an element off
18:24 - that end but what I want to do is add to
18:26 - the end and put you out here and I
18:27 - believe the correct JavaScript array
18:29 - function wladis shift
18:30 - so let's actually fix that in the
18:32 - algorithm Q dot shift and now let's take
18:39 - a look at what it looks like again there
18:43 - we go this looks much more correct and
18:46 - breadth-first search so it's trying and
18:49 - see how it's going sort of down and down
18:50 - and checking every possibility
18:51 - eventually it gets there haha so much
18:54 - better okay okay so these are the kinds
19:00 - of things I want to dive into these a
19:01 - bit more deeply next week I'll just show
19:04 - you a couple more examples here's one
19:06 - that I was attempting to while it's
19:09 - running through and let's actually fix
19:11 - the let me go fix it in here also change
19:15 - a pop to shift so this is what I'm
19:22 - talking about let me try to make this
19:23 - bigger with this idea of creating an
19:26 - agent that appears intelligent like it's
19:29 - trying to figure out the path but really
19:32 - it just looks like a cursor going to the
19:34 - like current node so I'm looking for
19:36 - creative possibilities of how do we use
19:39 - some of these algorithms that solve
19:41 - certain problems
19:42 - intelligent way and then visualize them
19:44 - in a creative fashion where the elements
19:46 - on the screen appear to be solving these
19:48 - prop figuring these out on their own
19:50 - it's just asking okay so and then these
19:55 - are from though this is not nothing to
19:59 - see here yet this is something that I
20:01 - did a coding challenge of quite a while
20:03 - ago this is using depth-first search to
20:04 - create a maze pattern and this is an
20:07 - a-star algorithm to solve a path through
20:10 - a maze but this is just not a mazes
20:12 - where the wrong word for this this is
20:13 - just a random grid with some some things
20:17 - being walls if something's not being
20:20 - walls so that's what I want to do is
20:23 - also one of my goals for an example for
20:25 - next week is to have a steering agent
20:28 - move throughout a maze solving it with a
20:31 - star so anybody who wants to help me I
20:35 - am subby is pointing out that I didn't
20:37 - make the the the connections
20:39 - bi-directional which is an issue so
20:44 - anybody who wants to you a couple things
20:47 - you can you could just file a pull
20:49 - request you can do a github issue this
20:52 - is what I hope to have finished and want
20:54 - to say by next week I really mean by
20:55 - Tuesdays when the class meets here at
20:57 - NYU and the next Friday is when I'm
20:58 - coming to do my live session okay so
21:01 - that's kind of other things I'm gonna do
21:03 - is talk about genetic algorithms
21:05 - although I mostly have a lot of videos
21:06 - on that already I have a couple new
21:07 - scenarios in mind that I'm gonna do look
21:09 - at some classification and prediction
21:11 - algorithms neural networks and then some
21:14 - applications of neural networks that are
21:16 - kind of new research in the last few
21:18 - years so if you're not aware neural
21:20 - networks are a concept that was
21:23 - developed in the mid twentieth century I
21:27 - don't know the exact date 40s and 50s
21:29 - and there was a lot of excitement and
21:32 - wonder and amazement at the
21:34 - possibilities what neural networks could
21:35 - do and then Marvin Minsky and other
21:39 - researchers kind of looked at basic
21:41 - simple neural networks in rise there's
21:43 - so many problems they just can't solve
21:45 - for example a simple perceptron cannot
21:47 - solve something called XOR and then that
21:50 - some other research came along to do
21:51 - this other kind of multi-layer network
21:53 - blah blah blah but there was
21:55 - a lot of excitement around neural
21:58 - networks but the I guess it's often
22:01 - informally referred to us like the AI
22:03 - winter there wasn't a lot of research
22:05 - that got very far for a long time until
22:08 - quite recently with some of these new
22:10 - advents in deep learning what is deep
22:14 - learning so this is stuff that I want to
22:15 - get into and that's going to come
22:16 - towards more towards the end of the
22:18 - course so I'm getting questions in the
22:23 - chat do you think you'll be back later
22:25 - today for a streaming session or is your
22:27 - schedule pretty much shot until next
22:28 - week so I am going to commit to coming
22:32 - back for at least one hour at some point
22:37 - this afternoon I lost about an hour for
22:40 - that because I lost about an hour with
22:42 - the fire issue and two things that I
22:44 - haven't done right now is I guess I kind
22:47 - of talked about the machine learning
22:48 - syllabus I didn't get to show these
22:51 - examples of work from the community so I
22:54 - want to be able to show those and I
22:57 - wanted to do who I felt like after this
23:00 - sort of crazy week that I've had I
23:03 - wanted to do do some sort of simple and
23:05 - fun coding challenges binary tree I put
23:07 - on there because it's kind of a nice
23:10 - entry point to some of the graph system
23:12 - stuff that I want to do next week but
23:14 - I've always asked for pong and I feel
23:16 - like pong can I bring back bunch of
23:18 - people from the last week have asked me
23:19 - to bring back the timer I think that
23:21 - probably not the core audience of my
23:23 - channel but there's some the casuals who
23:25 - just kind of watched snake video the
23:27 - Purple Rain video I have these two
23:28 - videos that had a timer going and a
23:31 - coding challenge it actually could be
23:32 - done and somewhere between 15 and 30
23:35 - minutes so I might where is this what's
23:38 - this March 10 thing alka that you keep
23:39 - posting about oh it says March 10th here
23:41 - thank you
23:42 - today is March 17th so I was thinking
23:45 - about doing that so fire day yeah so I'm
23:54 - sorry everybody this has been a bit of a
23:56 - fail for this morning I hope that
23:59 - discussion of neural networks I mean
24:03 - sorry
24:05 - that discussion of machine machine
24:08 - learning that discussion of and I'm very
24:12 - specifically my syllabus it does not say
24:14 - machine learning it does not say AI it
24:17 - just says intelligence and learning so
24:21 - that's my core topic and there's some
24:24 - pieces of it which I hope that we'll be
24:26 - able to program from scratch and
24:28 - understand how it works and some of it
24:30 - will actually be like can we just get
24:31 - the thing to compile and that's kind of
24:33 - Mona be my point of view and I'm this is
24:35 - all new to me I'm slightly terrified but
24:39 - I do enjoy this kind of learning with
24:41 - you as I try stuff on the channel so so
24:46 - that's that
24:47 - so I don't know what time this will be
24:49 - let me look at it now my I would like to
24:52 - say that I'm gonna come back at around
24:54 - two o'clock for one hour that's what I'm
24:57 - sort of hoping to do I guess stay tuned
24:59 - to the livestream page that's a place
25:02 - where I can update the time and I'll
25:04 - also tweet and post a note in the chat
25:09 - all right let me see if I can take five
25:12 - minutes of any just random questions
25:15 - from the chat okay
25:31 - and reading the YouTube chat which we're
25:34 - looking at the slack shot look at these
25:48 - interesting camera went off don't show
26:03 - processing work or is mine just not good
26:05 - enough I don't um so though I take the
26:07 - work from people who are in the patron
26:10 - group which is a slack channel for
26:14 - viewers who have chosen to help fund
26:17 - some of the efforts that I'm doing
26:18 - through patreon calm but I'm happy to
26:20 - show work what kind of hair products I
26:22 - use what kind of I'm happy to show work
26:24 - from other people best way would be to
26:25 - tweet me and I can I can I love to show
26:29 - stuff from processing what time is it
26:31 - where you are it is a 12:25 p.m. East
26:34 - Coast time do you ever do stuff other
26:38 - than Jay s such as Python or other web
26:40 - stuff like HTML and CSS I definitely do
26:43 - use HTML and CSS and a lot of my
26:45 - tutorials and but I have not done any
26:49 - tutorials in Python I do have a plan one
26:53 - thing I am thinking about is looking at
26:57 - tensorflow
26:58 - as as a framework to do something to
27:02 - implement some of these machine learning
27:03 - algorithms and tensorflow
27:06 - one way to use tend to flows through
27:08 - Python and I'm thinking about creating a
27:11 - simple Python server that runs the
27:14 - tensorflow stuff and then I can query it
27:17 - from a processing sketch or a p5.js web
27:20 - page to visualize so you know the one
27:23 - hand you don't need that other aspect of
27:25 - it if p5 are processing but that's
27:27 - something anybody wants to help with
27:28 - that I have a couple links I need to
27:32 - find where did I put those out
27:33 - let me find those because I'm gonna open
27:37 - that as an issue so one place that you
27:38 - might also look at is machine learning
27:41 - coding trade let's just see what comes
27:43 - up if I google that
27:45 - look at this fourth link so this is a
27:49 - repository from the community of just a
27:52 - ton a ton of links that are relevant to
27:54 - machine learning and Ida link that I'm
27:56 - looking for right now is oh no it's not
27:58 - here it was the reason why I thought it
28:03 - might be here is because it was a couple
28:05 - links that Patrick Hebron sent to me and
28:07 - Patrick Hebron is actually a researcher
28:09 - here at NYU and has written a book
28:10 - called machine learning for designers
28:12 - which I highly recommend and also has an
28:13 - accompanying webcast so if you want to
28:15 - go watch something about somebody who
28:17 - knows about this stuff go check out
28:20 - Patrick stuff but I'll have to find
28:22 - those I'm gonna add those I'm just gonna
28:23 - make it an issue right now issues oh
28:26 - look at this all these issues already oh
28:28 - I need just sign-in oh dear
28:31 - pick a username no no I sign in no idea
28:39 - what my password I just did a whole like
28:42 - redo of all my passwords it's all coming
28:44 - from one password I have all done 2-step
28:47 - verified on everything now so can
28:51 - somebody for me I'm gonna log in can
28:53 - somebody for me go to Schiffman slash
28:56 - NOC - as this repository issues and file
28:59 - an issue that says prepare simple flask
29:03 - server that serves tensorflow data to
29:07 - processing and/or p5 thank you very much
29:15 - I'm looking for any other questions what
29:18 - path did you learn to take what path did
29:21 - you take to learn to code this is from
29:22 - Cody fuller oh and ADA asks book
29:26 - recommendations these are good questions
29:28 - so I've actually I kind of would throw
29:32 - this okay so for a path that I took to
29:37 - learn to code well I'll tell you my
29:40 - first experience with coding was
29:43 - probably I'm trying to guess the year
29:45 - let's see I think it was about somewhere
29:49 - between third and fourth grade this
29:51 - would be like 1981 1982
29:55 - someone asked a fact chest FAQ fact
29:58 - check I was born in 1973 for those of
30:01 - you who are asking what my age is and so
30:04 - the first computer that I programmed on
30:05 - was an Apple 2 plus and I programmed it
30:08 - basic and I actually did a science fair
30:10 - project on perception where I wrote a
30:12 - basic program to flash things on the
30:15 - screen and like flash a word and leave
30:18 - it on only for a certain amount of time
30:19 - and to test whether people could see it
30:21 - and then type the word back in hey that
30:23 - would be a great coding challenge so
30:25 - it's a redo AHA straight let's do my old
30:28 - third fourth grade science fair project
30:30 - in JavaScript
30:31 - somebody add that to the rainbow topic
30:33 - suggestions they'll come to that this
30:34 - afternoon so but then I don't think I
30:38 - did any programming again until I
30:40 - believe in middle or high school I did
30:45 - some more basic and perhaps some logo
30:48 - and even a little assembly language in
30:50 - like a computer class then I never did
30:54 - any programming again until after I
30:58 - graduated from college at some point I
31:02 - took an evening class on C++ like oh
31:05 - maybe I should try some of that I did
31:06 - not like it at all
31:08 - terrible class I couldn't figure
31:10 - anything out gave that up
31:12 - then in 2001 I came as a student to ITP
31:17 - which is the program where I teach right
31:19 - now and I took a class called
31:22 - introduction to computational media and
31:24 - it was taught using the lingo
31:26 - programming language from Macromedia
31:27 - director and just the sort of
31:29 - interactive animation quality of that
31:31 - kind of hook to be and I rediscovered a
31:34 - lot of my interest in math and science
31:36 - and logic and numbers through
31:38 - programming and the kind of then I found
31:40 - processing sort of range towards
31:42 - prosthetics there so I mostly learn I
31:45 - learned I would say mostly as being an
31:47 - ITP student and I would say the primary
31:48 - way that I learned to program was trying
31:51 - to figure out processing which was a new
31:53 - thing at the time and trying to like
31:57 - write tutorials and stuff and JT Nimoy
32:01 - did a workshop on processing at ITP
32:03 - which was the first time that it came to
32:05 - ITP and where I heard about it
32:08 - and also I mean guitar ooh taught a
32:10 - class at ITP that used processing both
32:12 - before I started using processing at ITP
32:14 - okay okay
32:20 - all right everybody I'm sorry about this
32:24 - botched livestream for today I hope you
32:26 - got something out of it or at least it
32:27 - was nice to see each other it is 12:30 I
32:30 - am going to attempt to come back stay
32:36 - tuned at some point for one hour I'm
32:39 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do I'm
32:41 - gonna put up a Twitter poll I don't know
32:44 - which to I don't know I don't know if
32:48 - there maybe I'll just run my spinning
32:50 - this is I gotta figure what am I gonna
32:51 - do in that one hour people maybe I don't
32:57 - know it's not gonna be Chrome extensions
32:59 - look could be actually it could be any
33:00 - of these things so I'm gonna come back
33:02 - and do one or two of these things in an
33:06 - hour later show work from the community
33:08 - and that's that all so uh stay tuned I
33:12 - will release you might have small you
33:16 - guys seeing this live last week but the
33:18 - edited versions are now ready if I go to
33:20 - my youtube channel
33:22 - look I'm live now this I published 19
33:27 - hours ago the coding challenge 60 4.1
33:30 - forward kinematics all of the other
33:33 - follow-ups are actually available if you
33:35 - just go to the coding show they're
33:36 - unlisted because I kind of released them
33:38 - one a day but if you go to the coding
33:40 - challenges playlist and go to the bottom
33:42 - you'll see they're all here so if you're
33:44 - looking for something to watch and of
33:46 - interest forward kinematics inverse
33:48 - kinematics inverse kinematics with a
33:49 - fixed point and then multiple tentacle
33:52 - thingamabob errs okay thank you everyone
33:55 - 10-minute pong challenge I really like
33:57 - to do that too you know why it would be
33:58 - good because what we can do later is we
34:01 - can make an AI system that plays pong so
34:05 - that I think maybe I'll do that pong
34:06 - challenge can I really do it in ten
34:08 - minutes
34:08 - maybe what I'll even do I was talking
34:10 - about this earlier is I'll do it in
34:11 - processing but then I'll do I'll do it
34:13 - twice I'll do it in processing but
34:15 - they're not doing it in JavaScript but
34:16 - instead of doing it in a canvas I'll use
34:18 - like Dom elements like
34:20 - divs and text boxes and things to like
34:22 - be the be the palm alright thank you
34:27 - everybody ten minutes is probably
34:29 - unrealistic she probably saved twenty
34:31 - minutes that more real especially cuz I
34:33 - talk too much but maybe that's what I'll
34:35 - do this afternoon okay
34:36 - so if you're interested in that
34:37 - apologies for a little bit of the
34:39 - confusion around the machine learning
34:40 - stuff as you see next week I'm gonna
34:43 - look at graph systems I'm looking
34:45 - anybody wants to help me with that just
34:47 - chime in on github open github issues I
34:49 - let's help make those examples great oh
34:51 - boy did I really just say that I in a
34:55 - way that may be very uncomfortable and
34:58 - see you guys okay I'm gonna hit stop now
35:06 - hey I'm back did I actually work
35:11 - somebody said you forgot about the book
35:13 - recommendations does this actually work
35:15 - am i back let's see here
35:18 - book recommendations I don't actually
35:19 - have book recommendations but I just
35:21 - started reading a book called it's by
35:24 - hold on let me go to Amazon this is a
35:38 - book that I'm looking at make your own
35:40 - neural network there is my logged in
35:43 - under my account no I'm not so this is a
35:46 - book that I just got it's I think it's
35:48 - it's if you have Kindle limited it's
35:49 - free it's four dollars for the online
35:53 - version so I'm necessary recommending
35:55 - I'm recommending this in the sense that
35:56 - I've just started reading it maybe I'm
35:58 - like three or four pages in and it
36:00 - looked like what I was looking for
36:02 - something that I could follow that
36:03 - didn't have code and in processing or
36:06 - JavaScript and I could sort of follow it
36:08 - and try to reimplemented sin the book so
36:10 - this I think I'm going to use as a basis
36:13 - so that was one recommendation and the
36:15 - other recommendation I have is under
36:19 - books here ah Patrick Hebron what's this
36:22 - reinforcement learning book you know
36:24 - what I'm going to do is go to the
36:25 - library today did you know that you can
36:26 - go there's this place it's called the
36:29 - library and it's
36:31 - books and you can go find any book you
36:33 - want and take it with you you just have
36:36 - to bring it back later after you've
36:37 - finished it's amazing so maybe I'll go
36:39 - to the library so I would love anybody
36:41 - who has any book recommendations in
36:44 - particular on that are accessible
36:45 - friendly and for machine learning
36:48 - artificial intelligence topics please
36:52 - feel free to add to this repository
36:54 - Cody train / machine learning and then
36:56 - of course there's the classic the other
36:58 - book that I always used as a reference I
37:00 - mean it's got to come up why am i
37:03 - blanking on the authors if I just search
37:06 - for artificial intelligence book it's
37:09 - the seminal book at least how I think of
37:14 - it there's oh yeah there's the end this
37:17 - one artificial intelligence a modern
37:21 - approach
37:22 - Norvig and Russell so this is a book
37:25 - that I often use also as a kind of
37:27 - reference is this someone is saying is
37:33 - this link down this one look it's there
37:40 - maybe there's a different one this one
37:42 - oh yeah this is a book I have looked at
37:45 - this I haven't actually read it yet oh
37:47 - yeah I guess it's just an error I think
37:50 - there's some extra stray characters in
37:51 - that link because this is the book
37:53 - that's also been recommended
37:56 - I should probably you know what the
37:58 - thing is oh this is have a print version
38:00 - yet my issue is I'm a little bit weird I
38:03 - I don't I don't do very well reading
38:06 - books I've on a computer
38:08 - Kindle great print book great but I have
38:12 - trouble reading so this one I think is
38:13 - only available as an e-book in PDF
38:16 - format so I think that's I kind of that
38:18 - was that's why I didn't bother to get
38:20 - out though I guess I could print it out
38:22 - okay
38:23 - sorry now I'm going again and I will see
38:29 - you guys later this afternoon accompany
38:32 - pong let's just celebrate happy Friday
38:34 - and a spring break it's freezing there
38:36 - was like a foot of snow this week thank
38:39 - you Spring Break let's come back with
38:41 - the do palm later today and just have a
38:42 - good time okay and then next we
38:45 - we'll do some harder stuff I don't feel
38:47 - like doing anything hard today maybe god
38:48 - I got to go to lunch okay goodbye now
