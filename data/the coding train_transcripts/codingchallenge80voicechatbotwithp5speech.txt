00:00 - hi I'm gonna do one more a chatbot I'm
00:02 - kind of gonna do the exact same chatbot
00:04 - I just did maybe I'll change it from a
00:06 - number guessing thing to a knock-knock
00:07 - joke thing just to change it but instead
00:10 - of me typing guess the number between 1
00:14 - and 10 ok let's try 7 pick a higher
00:17 - number let's try 9 look a lower number
00:19 - let's try hate I got it instead of
00:21 - typing I want to interact with this chat
00:23 - bot through voice so it just recorded 2
00:26 - tutorials about the p5 speech library 1
00:30 - tutorial looks at text-to-speech so
00:34 - having the browser speak with a voice
00:37 - and another tutorial looks at speech to
00:40 - text listening to what I'm saying and
00:43 - and turning that into text
00:46 - so let's first so let me first cup two
00:49 - things let me deal with this chat bond a
00:51 - little bit let me first say one thing
00:54 - that I got wrong in the previous coding
00:55 - challenge video that I that I should as
00:57 - I as I created this like elaborate
01:00 - system if you recall to say to the chat
01:06 - bot set a number and then set the
01:08 - variable to whatever so I had to like
01:11 - secretly talk to the chat bot there's
01:12 - actually a set var method that's part of
01:14 - the rive script JavaScript library so I
01:16 - didn't have to use that convoluted
01:17 - methodology if you don't know I'm
01:18 - talking about you didn't watch the
01:20 - previous coding challenge you can go
01:21 - back and watch it this will make sense
01:22 - but this was an unnecessary step thank
01:25 - you for internet for correcting me and
01:27 - helping me with that but I'm actually
01:29 - going to just kind of get rid of this
01:33 - brain and I'm gonna start over I'm gonna
01:36 - do a sub I'm gonna I want to make sure
01:42 - cuz uh with a knock-knock joke you might
01:46 - say who is there or who's there
01:48 - knock-knock no but that's the bot saying
01:51 - that anyway so I don't need this sub
01:53 - what I'm gonna do is definite to have a
01:55 - catch-all which is anything the user
01:59 - says I'm going to say try saying
02:03 - knock-knock and then optionally if the
02:07 - user says anything with the phrase
02:11 - knock-knock in it so this is like a
02:13 - a wild card I wonder if I need that
02:15 - optional around there then I'm gonna
02:18 - then the bot is going to say who who's
02:22 - there
02:24 - okay so let's just try this and this is
02:28 - one of the examples from the rive script
02:29 - website so I can say anything I want and
02:31 - it's gonna say try saying knock knock
02:33 - and then I could just add knock knock
02:35 - and it's gonna say who's there I could
02:38 - say knock knock and it could say who's
02:42 - there now here's the thing now what I
02:45 - want to do is say well whatever they say
02:47 - in response to who's there the bot
02:56 - should say star one who and then at the
03:01 - end the bot should say haha so this is
03:08 - the sequence knock knock who's there
03:11 - Frank Frank who Frank Lance ha ha ha
03:18 - Franklin's making a weird nonsensical
03:22 - appearance in this video tutorial for no
03:24 - good reason but that's besides the point
03:27 - so here's the thing though VI can't have
03:30 - all these stars what I need is something
03:32 - to help me sequence and I'm kind of
03:34 - forgetting what the what the command is
03:37 - for sequencing but I'm gonna remember in
03:40 - a second because there's gonna be about
03:41 - to be an edit point we're gonna look it
03:43 - up now I'll just look it up with with
03:45 - you and watching me do this so I have an
03:47 - example that already does this I was
03:48 - trying to do it from scratch and here it
03:50 - is so ah the percent the percent means
03:55 - if the last thing was who is there then
03:59 - I say whatever who if the previous thing
04:03 - was whatever who then I can say haha
04:06 - that is so funny so I need to add this
04:09 - in to here right think about this this
04:14 - is saying this is a catch-all but only
04:17 - if the previous thing that the bot said
04:19 - was who is there ah but the bot says
04:22 - who's there this is why I want to have
04:26 - this substitution I knew there was a
04:27 - reason this substitution who's and who
04:32 - is our equivalent so whatever kind of
04:35 - mechanics is working have them be
04:36 - equivalent and then I also won by the
04:38 - way I don't usually do this in a coding
04:40 - challenge just like a copy-paste from an
04:42 - example but that's what I'm doing the
04:44 - point of this was to add the speech
04:45 - thing so I guess I could cut me some
04:48 - slack here so then at the end if the
04:52 - last thing was star who now let's see
04:56 - the order might matter let's see if the
04:58 - or let's see if this works I put these
05:00 - in a different order than in the example
05:01 - but let's see if this works
05:02 - so let's go back to the bot and I'm
05:05 - gonna just type in some nonsense to say
05:07 - try saying knock-knock
05:08 - so I'm gonna say knock knock say who's
05:10 - there coding coding who coding train
05:17 - [Music]
05:18 - okay so we have a working knock-knock
05:21 - joke chat bot thing because by the way
05:23 - if I were to say now coding train it's
05:26 - good as they try saying knock-knock
05:27 - right because it only laughed because it
05:29 - was part of the sequence but the whole
05:32 - point of this video however long I am in
05:34 - is now to 10,000 steps I walk back and
05:41 - forth lot it's really good to do a like
05:43 - live YouTube channel with a Fitbit on
05:45 - okay I wanted to speak so how do we do
05:49 - that so I need the p5.js speech library
05:53 - the v5 speech library how do I get that
05:54 - so I have that open here this github
05:56 - repository if I just go into here Lib
05:58 - and I see this particular file p5 speech
06:03 - Jas this is the file I need to download
06:05 - and include it as part of my project so
06:07 - I'm not gonna go through the steps to
06:08 - download it right now it's already there
06:10 - it's not already there but I'm gonna
06:11 - have an edit point I'm back and you can
06:14 - see that I've now added P five dots BJ
06:17 - yes to my folder with libraries in it
06:19 - and actually with the thing that I
06:19 - didn't do is I need to go into o index
06:22 - dot HTML and also add a reference to
06:26 - that p v dot speech jeaious library ok
06:29 - now I have this beef v speech library
06:30 - now what I want to do is I'm going to
06:35 - say let speech equals new p v dot speech
06:40 - and do I need an argument there I can't
06:43 - remember but I think no if I wanted to
06:45 - set a voice you know I'm just gonna use
06:46 - the default voice voice speech dot speak
06:50 - hello
06:51 - so let's just see if this works so
06:57 - unfortunately my sound system isn't
06:59 - working so great so you're hearing it
07:01 - out of the computer speakers and in
07:02 - through my mic hopefully you can hear it
07:03 - okay but you can see this is as simple
07:07 - as just creating a speech object and
07:08 - saying it's speak hello my other video I
07:10 - go through how to pick a different voice
07:11 - how to change the rate and pitch but I
07:14 - just want to use the default voice and
07:16 - now instead of wherever it says sticks
07:20 - the output in an HTML thing I'm gonna
07:23 - say speech dot speak reply okay here we
07:29 - go so I'm gonna type in some nonsense
07:32 - all right now I'm gonna say knock-knock
07:36 - coding coding rainbow okay so we get the
07:51 - idea we get the idea this works now I
07:54 - kind of want to remove the text there
07:55 - the point was this but now what I need I
07:57 - need four instead of me typing in the
08:00 - stuff I want to now be able to say it so
08:02 - okay so at the top what I can do is add
08:05 - a speech recognition object which is
08:10 - going to new P v dot speech recognition
08:13 - this is going to listen to me and I'm
08:17 - going to just give it a default language
08:19 - of us English you can change that and
08:20 - I'm gonna give it a call back got speech
08:24 - you could set it to a different language
08:26 - there's other ways to set this stuff you
08:27 - could see my full speech recognition
08:30 - tutorial for it but I'm Matt Goss but
08:32 - what I need to add now is a callback I'm
08:35 - gonna add it down here near the chat
08:36 - callback because ultimately whoop
08:39 - Scott's speech ultimately what I want to
08:43 - do is instead of when I press the button
08:45 - to submit something I want to submit
08:48 - something for when I heard from the user
08:51 - me so the first thing that
08:53 - to do is here I just want to check if
08:56 - speech recognition object result value
09:00 - that's the thing where it'll give you
09:01 - true or false whether it worked so long
09:03 - as it worked then let the input equal
09:08 - speech recognition result strength this
09:13 - gives me this is the value of what it
09:16 - actually heard so when it's got speech I
09:18 - check to see if it got it and then I if
09:21 - it worked
09:21 - I get the string the actual text now
09:23 - here's the thing this won't do anything
09:24 - I could say console dot log input right
09:29 - now but this won't do anything because I
09:31 - forgot something really important which
09:33 - is I need to say speech recognition
09:36 - start okay
09:39 - speech recognition to start now here's
09:41 - the thing if you watched my previous
09:43 - video about the speech recognition API
09:45 - by default it's only to listen to you
09:47 - once and in this case I want to listen
09:50 - continuously because I want the
09:51 - knock-knock joke to go all the way
09:52 - through so I'm going to say speech
09:55 - recognition start true for continuous
09:58 - mode and false and let me write this in
10:00 - a more clear way I'm going to say let
10:02 - continuous which is impossible to spell
10:04 - equal to true let interim equal false
10:08 - and that and so an interim is also
10:11 - apparently very hard for me to spell so
10:14 - interim would be if I wanted to listen
10:15 - continuously but I'm ok a what not that
10:17 - sorry not continuously I wanted to start
10:19 - giving me results as I'm speaking but
10:22 - here I'm okay with just getting the
10:23 - result after I've kind of paused so now
10:26 - that it's going to start I should start
10:28 - getting some stuff in this callback
10:30 - let's just see if that works
10:32 - hello are you listening to me great so
10:38 - I'm getting that text here so I'm
10:40 - basically done all I need to do this is
10:43 - very exciting all I need to do oh look
10:45 - there's some extra stuff in here that I
10:46 - don't need I don't need all this number
10:48 - stuff that I had from the previous
10:50 - number guessing chat bot all I need to
10:53 - do is everything I did in this chat
10:55 - where I got the input from the text
10:57 - input box now I have been put from the
11:00 - speech thing so all I need to do is say
11:03 - grab this stuff and put it right here
11:06 - and I'd like to
11:07 - something a little bit silly which is
11:09 - just just so we can sort of debug and
11:11 - see what's going on I'm going to sorry
11:14 - I'm going to add into the text box what
11:17 - I said so it's as if I'm like
11:18 - automatically speaking to type into the
11:20 - text box okay let's try this now
11:22 - oops num is not defined sketch I'd
11:26 - removed something which now apparently
11:27 - it needs somewhere else oh oh I don't
11:32 - need this reply or anything either there
11:34 - was some extra code for what was a
11:35 - number guessing chat bot hello
11:40 - try saying knock knock who's there
11:44 - oh it's just kept going I actually
11:47 - realized so I did write something wrong
11:49 - here where this text input box what's in
11:51 - the box is not it's HTML but actually
11:54 - its value so let me change that
11:57 - hello bot try saying knock knock knock
12:02 - knock who's there Dan
12:08 - dad who dad joke thank you very much
12:15 - thank you thank you where's my sound
12:17 - board with the applause I do have that I
12:19 - don't have it right now wait so this
12:20 - works I could come up with lots of goofy
12:22 - really bad knock-knock jokes to try to
12:24 - tell it I will spare you from that I
12:26 - don't think you need to watch that but I
12:28 - hope that you get the idea here try
12:32 - saying knock-knock
12:33 - right it was listening to everything I
12:35 - was saying and think about how you might
12:36 - make your own conversational interface
12:38 - let me actually let's just demonstrate
12:39 - the fact that I don't actually the point
12:41 - of this oh one more thing
12:42 - let me come here and I'm gonna go to
12:45 - index.html I'm gonna be saying
12:48 - knock-knock listening to me tell another
12:49 - knock-knock joke I'm gonna comment out
12:51 - all the HTML I'm gonna go into the code
12:53 - I don't need any of the interface get
12:55 - rid of all the interface get rid of the
12:57 - interface I'm going to this is interface
13:00 - this is interface and that's it oh and
13:05 - this is no longer necessary so now try
13:08 - saying knock knock good morning
13:14 - try saying knock knock knock knock
13:18 - whose hair the interrupting cow the
13:24 - interview so unfortunately I think I
13:28 - couldn't deal with the fact that I
13:29 - interrupted it but I do have another one
13:31 - knock knock who's there the interrupting
13:36 - coefficient of friction the interrupting
13:39 - coefficient of friction mu mu without
13:46 - the without the interrupting part that
13:49 - which is what supposedly makes a joke
13:50 - funny anyway so I hope you enjoyed this
13:52 - I'm in Korea I'm excited to see what you
13:54 - might make with this rive script p5.js
13:57 - p5 speech library a bunch of different
14:00 - pieces together basically how can you
14:02 - build your own voice interface without
14:05 - having to purchase a very expensive
14:08 - thing that lights up when you talk to it
14:10 - Expo this this doesn't work actually
14:13 - it's just a marker but you get the idea
14:14 - so please share with me what you make
14:16 - make your own chatbot your own
14:17 - conversational interface and I look
14:19 - forward to seeing you in a future coding
14:21 - challenge video thanks again to the
14:23 - ability project and Luke to BA and NYU
14:25 - for the p5 speech library
14:32 - [Music]
