00:00 - [DING]
00:01 - Hello, it's me again, your
friendly neighborhood coding
00:04 - person who made some bubbles.
00:06 - So if you were watching some
previous videos a while back,
00:09 - I made these bubble objects.
00:12 - And there they are.
00:13 - They're moving
around the screen.
00:14 - And then there were
some videos where
00:15 - I looked kind of different
which were about arrays,
00:19 - just like arrays of numbers,
and arrays of strings,
00:21 - and it's a list of things
and things have indices.
00:24 - So why am I here?
00:25 - Now, I'm here in this video
because I have this goal.
00:29 - I have this goal in
life which is to say,
00:31 - I have defined what it
means to be a bubble.
00:34 - I made a bubble class.
00:36 - I made a bubble object.
00:37 - And I made two bubble objects,
bubble 1 and bubble 2.
00:43 - And I would like to be able
to make 5 bubble objects.
00:46 - And I would like to
not have to do this
00:49 - because I would also like to
make 500 or 1,000 or 10,000.
00:53 - I want to be able to
duplicate as many objects
00:57 - as I want, create
as many objects
00:59 - as I want from that template,
from that class without having
01:02 - to have all these
separate variables.
01:04 - And isn't it just so
convenient that I'm right here,
01:09 - and we just talked about
objects and arrays.
01:11 - If I just put those
two things together,
01:12 - we'll be in good shape.
01:13 - So let's do that.
01:17 - OK, so let's just do that.
01:19 - No, don't go over there, OK.
01:21 - So I'm going to change this
from one variable, two variables
01:24 - to a single variable
called bubbles.
01:26 - Now, remember, when I
want a variable to hold
01:30 - an array, a list of
information, instead
01:32 - of making it equal to something
like an object or a number,
01:37 - I set it equal to
open, close brackets.
01:41 - There's other ways you
can create an array also,
01:43 - but this is a pretty
conventional way.
01:46 - Now what I might do is I might
say, OK, I have this array.
01:53 - In theory I have this
array that I could fill.
01:56 - Why don't I put a
bubble in index 0
02:00 - and a bubble in index 1?
02:02 - So I'm going to put my
bubble here and then
02:04 - put my bubble here.
02:05 - I'll make two bubble objects.
02:06 - Instead of having separate
variables, bubble 1, bubble 2,
02:12 - I am going to have a
variable bubbles index 0.
02:17 - Because remember, the first
spot in the array is 0, not 1.
02:21 - So it was kind of bad
that when I was doing this
02:23 - I named them bubble
1 and bubble 2.
02:25 - I should really name them
bubble 0 and bubble 1.
02:27 - So the first thing
I could do is just
02:28 - change this program to
say, like hey, bubbles 0,
02:34 - bubbles 1, bubbles 0, bubbles
0, you get the idea, right?
02:45 - Bubbles 1, oh, this is awful.
02:47 - Why am I even
bothering with this?
02:49 - Bubbles 1.
02:51 - Oh no, look at this.
02:52 - This is bubble 0 and 1.
02:54 - And this is bubble 0 and 1.
02:55 - Oh, oh, my goodness.
02:57 - Oh, my goodness.
02:58 - No, wait a second.
03:00 - Stop the presses.
03:01 - I'm so confused.
03:03 - I think what I would prefer
to do is move 0 and 1
03:06 - and then show 0 and 1.
03:07 - So of course, I could
do this in any order.
03:09 - But I want to move
the first one.
03:11 - And by the way,
this is not going
03:14 - to be the solution because even
though this now works, and I
03:17 - have the same exact
results, the only thing that
03:20 - have done differently
is that instead
03:23 - of having two separate
variables, I have one array.
03:25 - But I'm still referencing the
two separate bubble objects
03:28 - individually.
03:29 - So if I want to have
10 of them, I still
03:31 - have to keep adding more
and more lines of code.
03:33 - So what I want to do is I
want to use that for loop.
03:38 - If I say, for, let i equal 0,
i is less than some number, i
03:48 - plus plus, then inside
here, I can refer
03:53 - to that array called bubbles.
03:56 - Instead of saying hard coding
in 0, hard coding in 1,
04:01 - if I just say
bubbles index i, this
04:03 - is going to repeat many times
with a different value for i. i
04:07 - is 0, then it's 1, then
it's 2, then it's 3.
04:10 - So this is a way of me
iterating, accessing
04:13 - every single element
of that array.
04:15 - So I can use that too.
04:17 - And by the way, I
know, I know, there's
04:18 - like a for each sort of thing.
04:20 - And maybe I'll make
a video about that.
04:22 - But I'm going to just use a
nice for loop with a counter
04:25 - variable.
04:25 - So I'm going to say for let i
equal 0. i is less than two,
04:31 - i plus plus.
04:35 - And now instead of referencing
the bubbles individually,
04:39 - I'm going to just say
bubbles index high, which
04:43 - means I can now do this.
04:48 - Bubbles index i, that
same loop later in draw,
04:52 - this is to use a loop to create
the bubble objects in setup.
04:55 - I can say bubbles
index i dot move.
04:58 - Bubbles index i dot--
05:01 - I don't even remember
anymore-- show.
05:03 - Is that what it was?
05:04 - We can scroll down
and look at the bubble
05:06 - and see move and show, OK.
05:07 - So those were the
names of the functions
05:09 - that I used in
that bubble class.
05:11 - So now, let's run this again.
05:15 - And here we go.
05:17 - So look at that, ah.
05:18 - Now, I still have two
bubbles, but one was big
05:21 - and one was small before.
05:23 - And then they were
different spots.
05:26 - I lost that.
05:27 - So one of the things that I
had in my previous example
05:29 - if I just go back to here is I
had specified exact locations
05:35 - for each bubble object
and exact sizes.
05:38 - And now that I have a loop,
I'm in a much happier place
05:42 - in that I can easily
make 20 of these,
05:44 - but what do I do about
initializing all that stuff.
05:48 - So the thing is here-- hello,
welcome to programming--
05:52 - the reason why I'm
coding here is not
05:54 - because I want to specifically
set some exact locations
05:58 - for bubbles.
05:59 - More likely, I want to come up
with some kind of algorithm.
06:01 - Like, I want all the bubbles
to appear in a perfect grid.
06:04 - Or, I want them all
to appear randomly.
06:06 - Or, I want them to
be in a grid that's
06:08 - slightly offset randomly.
06:09 - Or, I want them to appear
in a spiral pattern.
06:11 - I want them all to
start in the same place.
06:12 - So what is that algorithm?
06:14 - So let me just say, so
one thing I could do
06:16 - is I could use the fact
that I have this counter i.
06:18 - And I could say, let x equal--
06:21 - well, what if I start the
bubbles starting at pixel 10,
06:26 - and then space them
out by 30 pixels.
06:31 - So this kind of came
to me immediately
06:32 - because I've done
this so many times.
06:34 - But this is now a formula that
when i is 0, x will equal 10.
06:38 - When i is 1, x will equal--
06:41 - 10 plus 30 times 1--
06:41 - 40.
06:42 - And if I ever got to 2,
which it won't in this case,
06:44 - so it would be 10 plus 30--
06:46 - 70, right?
06:47 - So this idea of spacing
the bubbles out so I if
06:51 - made three of them.
06:55 - And then of course, instead
of hardcoding this value here,
06:57 - I could say x.
06:59 - I could use this
variable to pass
07:00 - in which is calculated anyway.
07:02 - And then by the way, this
is really pretty bad.
07:04 - So one thing that's
bad about this
07:06 - is, now if I'm creating three
bubbles all of a sudden,
07:11 - then I left this
number two here.
07:13 - So what I want to do is
say, bubbles dot length.
07:17 - However, now, I can't use
bubbles dot length here
07:19 - because the array when I
first started was empty.
07:22 - So I'm adding
things to the array,
07:24 - a certain number of them.
07:25 - Then I can retrieve
that length later.
07:26 - And again, there
are different ways
07:28 - you can approach how
many spots there are
07:30 - and how you store the length.
07:31 - But this is just a way that I
would do it for this example.
07:34 - So now let's look at this.
07:36 - You can see, look at them.
07:37 - They are started now.
07:38 - Let's not move them
just so we can see.
07:41 - You can see, there
they are spaced out.
07:42 - And I could easily
just say, well,
07:44 - actually I want to space
them out by 100 pixels.
07:47 - And I want them just
to be 20 pixels.
07:49 - And there we go.
07:50 - And I want them to actually
start at least 20 pixels in.
07:54 - And you can see, there they are.
07:55 - And then I want to
have 10 of them.
07:58 - And there we go.
07:59 - But I can't really
have 10 of them.
08:00 - You get the idea.
08:01 - And now I could
put back in move.
08:06 - And there they go.
08:07 - So this is a way.
08:09 - Hello, do you see
something kind of exciting
08:12 - about this video, which is
that I haven't once changed
08:15 - any of the code down here.
08:18 - The idea of a single bubble
has remained exactly the same.
08:21 - The thing that's
different now is
08:23 - that I can create them
and put them in an array.
08:25 - And however many there are,
I could just move and show
08:28 - all of them.
08:30 - So I'm going to show you
a few more things here.
08:32 - Now, here's another
thing I could do.
08:36 - Let's just prove this point.
08:37 - Let's give them
all random spots.
08:39 - And again, I could set them
randomly in the constructor.
08:43 - But I'm just going
to do it here.
08:48 - So I'm going to just create
a whole bunch of bubbles
08:51 - with random locations.
08:54 - And we can say random sizes.
08:55 - And you can see, there they are.
08:56 - But this is what I'm
talking about now.
08:58 - I have this one program here.
09:01 - It makes 10 bubbles.
09:02 - I want this program
to now make 100.
09:06 - How many keys on
the keyboard do I
09:09 - need to hit in order
to make this change?
09:12 - One.
09:12 - [DING]
09:13 - If I've programmed everything
correctly, all I need to do
09:16 - is add a 0 here, and suddenly
I have a hundred of them.
09:22 - And if I add another 0,
suddenly I have 1,000 of them.
09:26 - Now, my program
might be slowing down
09:28 - because it's drawing
a lot of bubbles.
09:31 - And it's a lot to draw.
09:32 - And you know, I could start
to think about what I really
09:35 - want to do here.
09:35 - Maybe actually what
I want is for these
09:37 - bubbles not to have a stroke.
09:41 - But I want them to have a fill
with quite a bit of alpha.
09:46 - And I could take
this out of here.
09:48 - And now I've got this sort of
like cloudy thing going on.
09:53 - So again, I can use this idea.
09:54 - And what I'm really
doing here is
09:55 - I'm kind of on the way
to building something
09:57 - called a particle system.
09:59 - I am building a system of
many individual elements
10:01 - that together make
some sort of effect
10:03 - like a smoky-cloudy thing.
10:05 - But I could with
one variable now,
10:07 - with one value, change how
many things are in there.
10:09 - Now I'm going to do one
more thing in this video.
10:14 - And I'm going to actually
put the bubble back.
10:21 - So let's just go back to
where I was, just start
10:25 - with 10 bubbles, 10 bubbles.
10:28 - Now what if I take this
out of setup entirely?
10:33 - It's gone.
10:34 - What's going to happen?
10:35 - What's my program going to do?
10:39 - Nothing, emptiness, no bubbles.
10:42 - What if what I want to do is add
bubbles when I click the mouse?
10:46 - OK, let's think about this.
10:47 - The first thing that
I might want to do
10:51 - is figure out
where code executes
10:53 - when I click the mouse.
10:55 - So that is that I want to
add function mouse pressed.
11:02 - Now, what do I want to do?
11:03 - I want to make a bubble.
11:05 - Let B equals new bubble.
11:07 - I want that bubble to
be where the mouse is.
11:11 - And maybe it has a random
size between 10 and 50 pixels.
11:17 - Hey, I don't love these
1 character variables.
11:19 - I should do better than that.
11:20 - But I've picked a random number,
and I've made a new bubble.
11:22 - What if I want to put
that bubble in the array?
11:25 - Well, I could say something
like bubbles index 0 equals
11:29 - B, right?
11:30 - I could say, ah, the first spot
in the array put that bubble.
11:33 - And when I click
the mouse, look,
11:35 - I only have one though
because what I'm doing here
11:38 - is every single time
I'm making a new bubble
11:40 - and putting it in
the first spot.
11:42 - But if this were a counter, and
it went up every single time,
11:45 - I could put the first bubble in
the first spot, the next bubble
11:48 - in the second spot, the next
bubble in the third spot.
11:51 - But I could do even
better than that.
11:53 - There's actually a function.
11:54 - There are a lot of functions
associated with arrays.
11:56 - Arrays are actually
objects too that
11:57 - allow you to do certain things.
11:59 - And I'm going to get to them.
11:59 - I can delete stuff.
12:00 - I can move stuff around.
12:01 - I can shuffle, I can sort.
12:02 - But what I'm going to
do is I'm going to use
12:04 - this function called Push.
12:07 - Push is a function that means
add something to the array,
12:11 - push it to the array.
12:12 - And actually by default,
it's going to push it
12:14 - to the end of the array.
12:16 - So now that I have
that, every time I
12:21 - click I add a new bubble.
12:25 - And what's
interesting about this
12:26 - is there's no limit to
the number of bubbles
12:31 - I can have other than the
computer speed and memory.
12:33 - And interestingly enough, I
might just as a little effect
12:36 - change this to mouse dragged.
12:39 - And you can see now
when I drag the mouse,
12:41 - I'm kind of drawing this kind
of array of bubble objects, OK.
12:46 - So this is all about
making an array of objects.
12:49 - So if you're following
along, maybe you
12:51 - had an object you made, some
variation of the bubble.
12:53 - You made a bouncing ball.
12:54 - You made some kind
of flying pig.
12:56 - I don't know what it is you
made, a rainbow, a heart.
13:01 - Take that.
13:02 - Don't make any changes
in your class at all.
13:04 - Try to write a program where
you duplicated an array
13:07 - and you can just
change one number
13:08 - and you can have 500
versus 1,000 versus 10.
13:11 - See if you can add them
with clicking the mouse
13:13 - or hitting the
keyboard or some type.
13:15 - Maybe, what if you try to add
one every 10 seconds, how would
13:19 - you do that?
13:20 - What kind of event can trigger
the adding of an object?
13:24 - And then, what I want to do in
a future video, which maybe will
13:27 - be the next one is,
how could I delete
13:29 - these when I click on them?
13:33 - Well, first of all,
there's a couple of things.
13:35 - How do I know if
these bubbles are
13:36 - intersecting with each other?
13:37 - So I want objects to
talk to other objects.
13:39 - And I also want to be able
to talk to the objects.
13:42 - Bubbles, you bubble,
hello bubble.
13:45 - That's me talking to
the objects I guess.
13:46 - But I don't have
anything to say.
13:49 - Alexa, the bubble's name
is not Alexa, anyway.
13:54 - What was I talking about?
13:55 - Oh, so I want to be able
to figure out how do I
13:58 - interact with the bubbles?
14:00 - Can each bubble
have its own mouse
14:01 - pressed kind of like event?
14:03 - How does that work?
14:03 - So I gotta get to
that sort of stuff.
14:05 - And that'll come
in a future video.
14:07 - Thanks for watching.
14:08 - [DING]
