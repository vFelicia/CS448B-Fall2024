00:00 - In this video I want to look at the node
package manager.
00:04 - What is the node package manager what is a Node package? Why would you want to
00:07 - manage packages?
00:09 - who is managing them for you what all that
sort of stuff, so what is this thing?
00:13 - why do you need it? And why is it
relevant in particular for this context
00:16 - of building a Twitter bot with node?
00:20 - Ok so up I'm gonna come over here to the
whiteboard not really sure why just yet.
00:25 - So node  package manager is typically
referred to online as NPM. If yougoogle npm
00:31 - you'll probably find a node package
manager website. This is not a separate
00:34 - thing you need to install.When you
install node NPM came with it and npm
00:40 - is another command that you can run from the 
terminal from a console on and execute
00:46 - various things associated with the
project.
00:49 - So the the first thing that we ...ok so
let's think about so why this thing
00:53 - exists anyway. So you're writing code,
00:57 - you're a person who's working on
something with code and you have this
01:00 - idea because you want to work with an
API or you want to generate SVG, PDF
01:06 - images for some other thing right.
01:09 - And you're working javascript in node and
you're.. Well how do you do that
01:13 - So it's very rare that you're just going
to build everything from nothing. You're
01:17 - just going to start from a total clean
slate. All you have is javascript in
01:20 - front of you and you're going to somehow
build an entire engine that renders
01:24 - PDFs or talks to York Times API.
01:27 - Most likely you want to use somebody
else's library of code that they made
01:30 - available open source to you that you
can kind of piggyback off.And
01:34 - hopefully you might contribute back to
it or make your own package of some day
01:37 - but this is what a package is.So the
particular package ... then I feel weird
01:44 - saying because I don't know..
01:46 - twit is like a weird thing to say. But the particular package that I'm going
01:50 - to use in these particular videos about
making a twitter bot is a package called
01:55 - twit.
01:56 - Because i am a twit
01:59 - let's just all get that out there.
02:01 - That's why am I am a twit I am NOT ah I
always forget to reset these cameras.So
02:07 - okay so I'm a twit for not resetting the
cameras ok
02:13 - I don't even know what that is what is
a twit it's a it's what I want anyway.
02:16 - Ok so a package and NPM. So how do you
install a package : You say
02:22 - npm install  "the name of the package"
02:30 - So where do you say that,  why you, when do you say that how do you do that.So one
02:34 - of the things that happens when you work
on a node project is that you want to
02:39 - have this thing that this file called
"package"... as you saw you can just write
02:47 - Javascript in the previous video you can just write so,e Javascript Code just script code
02:50 - executes JavaScript code it works. But
when you start to like think of a
02:54 - project you're making that has a bunch
of different components and imports
02:57 - various packages and might depend on
other modules can keep using all these
03:00 - different kinds of words.This file
called package.json is like ...you can
03:05 - think of it as your "settings" file for
your whole project or your "config" file
03:10 - for your whole project.One of the
things that you might put in a
03:16 - package.json file is other types of
other...
03:20 - what's known as other dependencies
dep- end and "deep n Dead Sea's" (nice one auto caption). Never got
03:28 - close enough so.
03:30 - Notice here before the file
extension that JSON
03:35 - this is a file that's of the JSON format.
Magic link to video that i made about
03:41 - JSON and what that is!
03:42 - Make that appear in an annotation or a
card or something I don't know.
03:46 - So uh so that's so so you could start to
write this file yourself . But one of the
03:52 - things you can do with node package
manager is say npm
03:56 - in it so that's the very first thing
that I think i'll demonstrate to you as
04:01 - I come over here. So i'm going to
minimize chrome and I'm going to come
04:06 - over  her. Now remember i'm gonna say ...By the way something I like to type is
04:10 - "clear" which clears the terminal on a
mac i'm going to say  PWD
04:14 - SoI'm in you know processing desktop
youtube code this is the folder that I'm in.
04:19 - And actually something i could do is
say "open." .  What that's going to do is
04:24 - open that folder in the finder
04:26 - so I want to kind of go back here and
I'm going to make another folder called
04:31 - node2And what I want to do is now cd .. it will move me up one directory so you
04:40 - can see I'm just in the YouTube code
directory. And now i'm going to go to cd
04:44 - node2
04:45 - - so now i'm in this folder right you
can see it there there's nothing in
04:50 - there and now is the time where we're
going to say something exciting.I'm
04:54 - going to say and npm init.
04:58 - So with that what this does is it's
telling you "this utility will walk you
05:01 - through creating a package.json file it
only covers the most common items and
05:05 - tries to guess sensible defaults". so this
is useful to you you don't have to do it
05:09 - this way you could make the package.json file yourself but npm.initt will
05:14 - kind of prompt you to cite to ask you
some questions like what's the name of
05:17 - your project
05:18 - You know what let's call it npm
demo ...by the way no spaces can go in
05:25 - this name which will often trip me up
because it won't tell you till the end
05:29 - so npm demo the version like if I'm
keeping track of versions of projects
05:33 - whatever 1.0 sounds good , description I
am demo demos them on demonstrating npm
05:40 - entry . entry . this is a key question
what's the name of the file that node
05:48 - should trigger to run your program I
called it hello.js before.You can
05:52 - call it index.jsyou can call it
server.js
05:55 - you could call it BOTS.js let's call
it BOTS .js because that's ultimately
05:59 - what we're going to make eventually.
06:01 - Although this isn't really a bot yet.
06:02 - Test command ... whatever i don't know what that is
06:06 - let's skip that git repository that's
another topic for another time.I'm not
06:09 - going to worry about a git repository
right now.
06:11 - Keywords : "rainbow"
06:14 - "awesome" whatever "awkward" maybe it's more
appropriate for me and the author is a
06:22 - myself.
06:24 - Ahatever not that none of this matters I..
you know this matters if you're old and
06:27 - license you know eventually  it's
like saying "does this look right to you"
06:31 - and I'm just going to say yes.
06:32 - so what you're seeing here is it's
creating that package.json file a lot of
06:37 - that doesn't really matter to you right
now it's kind of good practice to get
06:39 - started with it because ultimately you
might want to release this as a kind of
06:44 - published project or open source it.
Upload it to this thing called github
06:47 - make it official, a node package that other
people can use
06:50 - there's lots of possibilities here so
you're kind of getting off on the right
06:52 - foot
06:53 - by starting with this package.json file
so now if i go into SUblime here and i'm
06:59 - going to say file.open and i'm gonna
i'm just going to open..One of the things
07:03 - you can do, is you can
open Sublime, Sublime by the way that's a text
07:06 - editor that i'm using its not free
although you can download kind of a free
07:09 - version but you can use any text editor
for the stuff that I'm doing...
07:12 - um you know text edit will work for you.
07:17 - So one thing you can do with Sublime is open a full directory and you can see
07:21 - now here on the side here
07:24 - I have kind of a directory structure and
what I want to do is look under node2 and
07:28 - you can see look at that that file
didn't exist I didn't make that file
07:31 - this file arrived  because I ran npn
in it so i can click on this file and
07:36 - you can see there's there's the JSON
file it's got the name, the versions
07:42 - it's got this thing called scripts, got
some keywords as an author but I get
07:46 - acting out edit this file just, change it
manually like "oh I wanted to have a period
07:51 - here" that sort of thing.
07:52 - So you now have a package.json file
07:57 - ok so now I said that I wanted to use
the twit package
08:04 - So how do you find out what packages you
want what you might want to use and how
08:08 - do you install them? so i can go back to
Chrome here.
08:11 - Go back to a browser and i can i'm just
going to google npm. and i'm going to
08:16 - end up on the npm , npmjs.com
website
08:21 - so this is a website which has a
collection of all of many comments of
08:26 - all packages that you could possibly
think of installing. For example one
08:30 - the ones that I i hope to make some
videos about at some point is this
08:33 - package called express and this is what
you really want to use if you want to
08:37 - like make a quick web server. If you want
to host some files if you want to kind
08:42 - of spin up your own API, would like
to get to
08:45 - I would like to make up set of videos
about using Expres.But we're here and
08:49 - we're like okay well let's say I want to
use something that's going to help me
08:52 - talk to twitter so i could type twitter
in the search and you can see
08:56 - wow there's a lot... easy easy twitter
twitter.js asked Twitter tokens
09:00 - Twitter 1.1 Twitter and so this now
becomes this is your life
09:04 - Welcome to your life! You know i
don't know maybe you should go do
09:09 - something else like how do you pick
which one what do you do?
09:12 - So a lot of this is you know ask a
friend maybe already made something with
09:16 - twitter i could be your friend.I might tell you that I use that twit one
09:20 - who seems to be working for me why don't you try it
09:23 - but another thing you can do is kind of
look at it.You can see if it has good
09:26 - documentation when was the last time was updated like it added if the last time a
09:30 - code update like if I look at this one
09:32 - like soff twitter we can see here... there
not really like a huge amount of
09:39 - documentation was published a year ago 0. 0.1 is the latest release like i might
09:44 - say I don't like this. Wait maybe it is a
wonderful package I don't even know who
09:48 - made it or why it's there but this is
the kind of things you might want to
09:50 - look for. And certainly clicking over to
the github repository which is where
09:54 - that source code you can find the source
code for it and you can see here that
10:01 - you know september 5th 2014
10:04 - it's only had like four commits so maybe
this isn't sort of actively maintained
10:08 - project.
10:09 - Um I'm going to look for the twit1 i'm
just going to put in a twit here and I
10:15 - think you can see here this is a twitter
api for node.
10:19 - It says REST - if you want to take a rest
10:24 - but you might want to after watching
this video and streaming so this is good
10:27 - We're going to use this streaming
feature of the API . What streaming with
10:30 - the API? it's kind of exciting and you
can see here is giving you up a little
10:33 - message of how oh I'm standing in front
of it i have this bad habit of how to
10:37 - install it npm install twit
10:40 - it's giving you some like example code
of how to use it.
10:43 - This so this looks like it's got pretty
good documentation and information
10:46 - so this is a good one to use and I'm
gonna use it for my examples
10:49 - so now how do you install it now?
10:53 - We saw that on the page it said you
could say npm install twit and this will
10:57 - in fact install the twit package.
11:00 - However what I might suggest to you that
you do is also type in
11:04 - - - save. what - - save as an argument to
NPM install means is save a reference to
11:13 - this particular package to your
package.json file and so now if i hit
11:19 - enter
11:19 - some stuff is happening it's
warning me because I didn't really fill
11:23 - out everything in that NPM package its
installed a whole bunch of thing time
11:26 - like twit actually depends on all these
other packages that it's using one's
11:30 - called tough-cookie which I'm not tough
cookie.
11:33 - I thought ... I'll melt very easily you know
give me a package that's not well
11:36 - doesn't have good documentation and I'm
you know weeping instantly but i don't
11:41 - know i'm talking about that um so
11:44 - so you can see and install that and now
couple things one is you can see look at
11:48 - this
11:49 - dependencies right now right now in my
in my package that JSON finally added
11:55 - this so as this project moves
around or gets uploaded and shared.
11:59 - It will always remember that this
package this project working on requires
12:04 - this twit dependency.. Which will help it
 if you like
12:08 - deploying to a server and the server is
going to automatically install the
12:11 - dependency for you.
12:12 - All sorts of possibilities there why
this might be useful and also another
12:16 - thing you'll notice is that there is 
suddenly now ...remember I'm in node2
12:21 - if I go into this folder there's
suddenly in addition to the package.json
12:24 - file
12:25 - There's a node modules folder and that
node modules folder you'll notice has
12:29 - the twit module and that has examples
library other modules it depends on test
12:34 - the readme file. So all the stuff for
that particular node module is now in
12:38 - the local directory for your project.
12:41 - So now we are ready now we're actually
ready to write some code.
12:45 - It's kind of been a long journey here
of like first got installed node and you
12:48 - got to learn with this npm thing is that
you got it like do npm init and then
12:52 - you gotta do npm install but all of this
12:55 - it has a purpose. It has a greater
purpose because we're gonna get to the
12:58 - fun part of actually talking to Twitter
posting to Twitter coming up with weird
13:02 - strange things that you might do
automatically with Twitter bot.So so if
13:09 - you're following along
13:10 - what I would make sure you can do now is make a package.json file run npm in it
13:16 - run npm install twit -- save then you'll
be ready for the next video we're going
13:20 - to start actually adding the code for
talking to Twitter
13:24 - and then it stopped.
