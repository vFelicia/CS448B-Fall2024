01:09 - hello and happy holidays from the
01:12 - Gooding train I actually forgot to check
01:23 - my audio I've been rushing to get here
01:26 - in time to start live streaming on this
01:29 - special end of year last coding train
01:32 - broadcast and but maybe somebody in the
01:37 - chat can tell me if everything seems to
01:38 - be going okay I am but hello first of
01:44 - all hello to my children who are
01:45 - watching from an off from school and
01:48 - watching from another city I will be
01:50 - seeing you tomorrow
01:51 - hello people are talking that the
01:54 - framerate is a little bit weird but I'm
01:57 - just gonna keep going I don't know what
01:59 - to do about that I'm streaming as I
02:01 - always do alright so first of all
02:06 - [Music]
02:13 - do you hear that I have a keyboard here
02:16 - it's gonna be music because it's the
02:18 - holiday special so what am I going to do
02:21 - today first of all I want to say that
02:23 - this special holiday coding train is not
02:28 - brought to you by but is a fundraiser
02:30 - for folks I'm in the wrong place in the
02:32 - wrong place don't look at that I don't
02:33 - know what that was
02:34 - processing Foundation org so one of the
02:44 - tools that I use in most of my coding
02:48 - challenges in coding tutorials two
02:51 - different tools that I use our
02:52 - processing a programming environment
02:54 - built on Java and p5.js they library for
02:57 - JavaScript and a bunch of related other
02:59 - sort of like things and so the
03:03 - processing foundation is a
03:04 - non-for-profit u.s. corporation very
03:09 - small we have a very small budget and a
03:10 - small group of volunteers who
03:11 - essentially manage the foundation one of
03:15 - the things we do right now which I have
03:16 - mentioned many times is we run a
03:19 - fellowship program you can see some of
03:21 - our lovely fellows here Cassie and
03:23 - Andrew DIY girls Gottfried Nicolas
03:26 - Saskia Susan Alison Claire we keep going
03:31 - digital systems lab Jessica Atul tiga
03:33 - and Luisa I don't want to leave anyone
03:35 - out film and Lauren originally the p5.js
03:38 - project was started as a fellowship from
03:41 - Lauren McCarthy with the processing
03:42 - foundation now Lauren is the lead
03:44 - developer of p5.js and a director of the
03:47 - foundation so that's the end of the year
03:50 - if you if you have the oops and I just
03:54 - want to go to the homepage no wrong page
03:58 - if you have the means and are interested
04:02 - in making a donation I will ring this
04:06 - bell for every donation that comes in
04:09 - this live updates I you know I'd love to
04:11 - say let's get it to twenty thousand
04:13 - dollars by the end of this livestream a
04:15 - couple hours from now I don't know if
04:16 - that's realistic but I'm gonna oh no my
04:19 - camera with the camera went off
04:23 - children you could probably text me if
04:27 - you have an important message to send to
04:29 - me and I will see it here but you can
04:32 - also type into the YouTube chat although
04:33 - you know I don't know
04:34 - privacy whatever but okay oh this
04:38 - computer went off so let's I will read
04:42 - your name live on air and thank you I
04:44 - would sing a song if you donate by the
04:49 - way I'm just mentioning if you're here
04:52 - to see coding I want to just wait for
04:56 - the next live stream which I'll be back
04:57 - in 2018
04:59 - with my usual coding tutorials I will
05:01 - attempt to do some coding today but it's
05:02 - probably gonna go very poorly and won't
05:04 - really interest you so you might want to
05:05 - just go do something else
05:07 - alright oh wait wait wait I'm getting
05:11 - message no it's a Twitter notification
05:14 - fine okay
05:16 - I forgot to tweet that I started but I
05:18 - guess I started okay alright let's see
05:22 - did anyone donate yet
05:43 - not yet
05:49 - but I assume that some people at some
05:52 - point donate something we're asking
05:55 - people to become a member you also will
05:57 - have your name listed here on the
06:00 - membership page we use this of these
06:02 - funds to support the fellowship program
06:04 - I'm going to talk to you more about that
06:05 - and show you some videos from different
06:08 - fellows and from from the processing day
06:12 - no no okay
06:14 - so it's very nice of you to donate
06:16 - through the YouTube super chat oh so
06:20 - people are timing the audio and the
06:22 - frame rate okay
06:24 - okay time out everyone I'm being told
06:27 - that I'm having some technical problems
06:29 - so what I'm going to do in this case is
06:32 - I'm simply going to I wonder if this is
06:36 - causing some weird interference but I am
06:40 - going to restart the computer that tends
06:45 - to offer so I'm going to turn on the
06:46 - monitor so let me hear what's going on
06:51 - hello
06:55 - [Music]
07:01 - so I'm hearing myself normally I'm not
07:05 - hearing any audio glitching okay yes
07:10 - so people are telling people are
07:12 - donating through some people are
07:14 - donating through this super chat and I
07:17 - am happy to say for today's livestream
07:20 - any donations that come in through the
07:23 - super chat I will I will reap donate to
07:28 - the processing foundation if you're a US
07:30 - citizen you won't feel to get the tax
07:31 - deduction I look at the tax deduction
07:33 - but but I will do that I will look at
07:38 - what this but I I would prefer my
07:39 - preference is for you to donate to the
07:45 - look at this we've got some donations I
07:50 - figure what that number was that I think
07:52 - was at 72 nobody can hear me I think I
07:55 - better just restart the computer people
07:58 - are telling me there's problems I'm
07:59 - gonna come back okay I'm gonna just
08:03 - restart the computer and hope that does
08:05 - the trick so this live stream is going
08:06 - to temporarily shutdown and it will
08:08 - appear same link you youtube.com slash
08:12 - user slash shipment slash live okay
08:15 - let's see what I can do here alright I'm
08:23 - back I actually didn't check anything
08:24 - I'm just sort of hoping that that fixed
08:26 - it and so now what I'm going to do is
08:30 - I'm going to go and check the donations
08:32 - so oh I see two donations have come in
08:38 - 203 donations have come in I'm going to
08:42 - thank and now what I want to do is I'm
08:44 - gonna check if you put your name to have
08:47 - a public name I'm gonna read that name
08:49 - so hopefully that's okay thank you to
08:51 - Steve Clement thank you to a leaky Cal
09:01 - Harris who is thank you Oh a key my
09:05 - wacky sidekick Aliki and thank you too
09:09 - hard to read people are telling me that
09:12 - the frames per second is not
09:14 - better I don't know if that's just the
09:17 - internet today
09:19 - what's this message telling me no show
09:22 - sorry
09:22 - I'm gonna check a few things so people
09:25 - are telling me it works fine so I don't
09:29 - know why some people are having
09:31 - frames-per-second issues and some people
09:33 - are not so I'm hoping that's just maybe
09:34 - maybe net neutrality was cancelled
09:38 - I know click here it says net neutrality
09:40 - issue buffering I'm buffering I'm
09:43 - buffering I'm buffering
09:44 - I'm buffering
09:46 - [Music]
09:52 - is that so working okay and i am
09:57 - recording two discs so at the very least
10:00 - there will be a archived backup of this
10:03 - or if I have to like delete the archive
10:05 - live scream stream and upload a new
10:07 - version of it that's what I'm gonna have
10:08 - to do so and some people are saying it
10:10 - isn't bad so maybe it's a bottleneck
10:12 - somewhere okay so okay so our first
10:18 - three donations let's see if there's any
10:20 - more we wait I'm getting a message here
10:26 - in the chat still a popping sound now
10:31 - that could be something else I don't
10:33 - know why some people are saying it mmm
10:37 - still a popping sound well I don't hear
10:41 - the popping sound in my monitor so it
10:43 - could be I do have this new I could
10:46 - debug this but but I'm first can you
10:51 - play the keyboard and turn off your mic
10:52 - input okay alright hold on my mic input
10:59 - is muting
11:02 - [Music]
11:13 - did that do anything this is really sad
11:18 - it was all planning might what still
11:20 - there
11:21 - okay now what if I just completely
11:23 - unplug the keyboard is the popping sound
11:28 - gone is the popping sound gone with the
11:34 - keyboard is now in plug well
11:36 - oh I unplugged the wrong thing big now
11:42 - I'm unplugging the keyboard so it's
11:46 - unplugged but now it's off drink a
12:01 - little this ginger tea hmm so the
12:07 - keyboard is the source of the popping I
12:10 - have an idea okay that's good to know
12:14 - that's very sad but at least I could
12:16 - hold on I'm just gonna try I think
12:18 - though it could be some wires are
12:20 - crossed in a weird way just give me a
12:23 - second here okay keyboard is still
12:29 - unplugged now people are hearing the
12:32 - Buffs I it's popping right now
12:35 - interesting I think I I kind of have us
12:39 - I kind of have a suspicion and I'm gonna
12:41 - work on doing something so just
12:43 - everybody bear with me for a second
12:48 - it's a weird how I don't hear it okay
12:54 - hold on
13:02 - all right I have moved the mic thing far
13:07 - away still pops okay use the popping now
13:11 - as I'm clapping my hands still poppy
13:21 - alright somebody just gave a very large
13:23 - donation and which is going to go to the
13:26 - processing Foundation which was Dinesh
13:30 - thank you it's actually in a currency I
13:33 - don't know what it is or maybe it wasn't
13:34 - a very large donation this is a big
13:38 - number I don't recognize that currency
13:40 - symbol because I am a silly American
13:43 - alright so it's possible I'm going to it
13:51 - seems to be that it's this mic so I do
13:54 - have one other option which is to let me
13:59 - just swap out the batteries here
16:26 - okay I have swapped out a bunch of I
16:31 - have swapped out a bunch of whoa where
16:34 - am I
16:38 - whoa can you hear me I swapped out a
16:44 - bunch of cables I also unplugged
16:48 - something by accident that shouldn't
16:49 - have been unplugged
17:05 - I'm trying to plug this back in and plug
17:09 - something by accident okay whoa okay
17:20 - anything better now this hasn't happened
17:33 - for a long time it's very sad I want it
17:35 - like thank everybody for their donations
17:36 - oh look at all these donations that have
17:38 - come in this is amazing
17:39 - it pops only when I talk No yeah though
17:49 - if the thing is let me okay let me just
17:51 - listen to the monitor real quick test so
17:59 - there's absolutely no popping I think
18:06 - it's I think it's the low bit rate
18:12 - that's causing the popping and that's
18:14 - like something some people aren't having
18:15 - it and some people are having it my
18:20 - monitor is coming directly out of OBS
18:22 - I'm listening to the monitors coming
18:25 - directly out of OBS that's what I'm
18:27 - monitoring with no popping all right
18:30 - we're gonna go back kids are you still
18:34 - watching but this is what usually
18:36 - happens I swear I mean I would love to I
18:46 - could check the streaming settings
18:50 - settings stream you know there's nothing
18:55 - has changed yes I see some sunglasses
19:04 - there thank you all right let's thank
19:08 - some more donations so I'm just gonna
19:12 - have to you know one thing I can do
19:15 - actually if you guys don't mind humoring
19:16 - me for a second is Ike
19:19 - watch the video that I recorded from
19:24 - earlier and wait hold on desktop this is
19:32 - the worst this is the worst there is one
19:39 - a short from 11:23 a.m. this morning I'm
19:43 - going to open this video file up and I'm
19:45 - going to listen to it so this is the
19:46 - recorded to disk and I'm going to see if
19:51 - I can hear
20:10 - okay I can confirm that in the recorder
20:13 - to disk version there is no sound
20:15 - problems whatsoever so something is
20:17 - happening simply after wire cat up mount
20:21 - wire cast OBS takes the feed and sends
20:24 - it out to YouTube I could try stop and
20:27 - starting the stream again I could go one
20:29 - thing I could do is I could look I could
20:35 - look on my livestream dashboard so the
20:40 - stream health is good and under stream
20:43 - options so okay so I am going to stop
20:53 - I'm gonna hey we're back pretend none of
20:58 - that happened before happy holidays but
21:03 - the coding trade a youtube show thing
21:07 - tutorial coding thing which sometimes I
21:10 - code but today very little code is
21:12 - happening because I'm mostly talking
21:14 - about this is a live telethon for the
21:16 - processing foundation and now that we
21:18 - have up to 82 donors I wouldn't it start
21:21 - with someone tell me was it at 72 I can
21:25 - see the bad bit rate on my preview
21:26 - though
21:27 - and so I'm gonna thank some more donors
21:31 - I'm gonna thank public name this person
21:38 - does not have a public name so I'm not
21:39 - going to read their name but thank you
21:41 - for the donation from Denmark I'm going
21:44 - to this person also does not have a
21:46 - public name so thank you to another
21:48 - donor and then thank you to a Mart
21:53 - Marcin Shweta I don't know if I probably
21:56 - pronounced that incorrectly somebody can
21:57 - help me in the chat so maybe some of you
22:02 - can only donate through the through the
22:05 - this super chat I do I you know I don't
22:08 - usually have that enabled I will read Oh
22:10 - Nate any donations through the super
22:11 - chat but it's much more fun if I can
22:15 - watch this live thermometer go up and so
22:18 - now for our first holiday tune to thank
22:22 - all of the donors
22:26 - this is song is called mystic health I
22:32 - have a little issue by the way I can't
22:39 - sing
22:40 - I'm terrible singing and you should
22:43 - probably go watch something else today
22:44 - that's all I've got to say okay hold on
22:45 - let me go out of the support page back
22:47 - to the slack Channel does used to tube
22:50 - maybe YouTube still thinks I'm on a
22:51 - phone interesting okay
22:58 - [Music]
23:07 - whereas debug
23:09 - completely then full request I will and
23:23 - when it's debug completely request I
23:31 - will thank you happy holidays everyone
23:37 - thank you thank you oh whoops my sound
23:43 - effects are no longer playing wait hold
23:46 - on
23:47 - it just happened there ah nothing not
23:53 - everything can work all at once
23:56 - okay keyboard volume is a little bit too
23:58 - loud thank you for letting me know I
24:00 - have no idea how to fix that okay so
24:05 - first of all if you would like to write
24:08 - your own holiday spot coding train
24:10 - themed holiday song lyrics to a popular
24:12 - holiday tune that I can easily find the
24:14 - chords for or just play by ear like
24:17 - jingle bells probably very easy
24:20 - [Music]
24:26 - um I will think it live on air today
24:31 - okay
24:32 - yeah that's finished okay let's see how
24:36 - many donations came in based off of that
24:38 - performance eighty-two okay okay now why
24:42 - this uh this I'm not gonna worry about
24:45 - too much but all of a sudden here my
24:51 - method for playing my sound effects
25:00 - seems to have failed and oh it got
25:10 - unplugged so what I need to do is add
25:18 - this again and we're back in business
25:27 - okay now I'm gonna take a short asking
25:35 - why are you taking a break you haven't
25:38 - done anything yet my life is probably my
25:40 - lowest rated live stream ever first of
25:43 - all I'm not doing it I'm done in
25:44 - encoding I'm wearing a ridiculous hat
25:46 - I just sang some silly songs and I had
25:51 - all these technical difficulties and
25:54 - it's already 40 minutes in you know this
25:57 - is a freak I gotta get going this
25:59 - afternoon I've gotta do a lot of stuff
26:02 - today
26:03 - I didn't eat luck I ate a very like
26:05 - breakfast that was very there was a
26:06 - subway was terrible this morning but
26:08 - barely made it down here that's why I'm
26:09 - like a half an hour late and I'm gonna
26:11 - have to eat lunch at some point
26:12 - everybody knows I get woozy after a
26:13 - little while I do have to stay hydrated
26:15 - because as we all know coding train is
26:21 - brought to you by water if you boil it
26:28 - it gets hot and then you could put a
26:30 - teabag in it or actually you could even
26:32 - don't even need a teabag you could
26:33 - actually just use tea leaves and you can
26:34 - have some delicious
26:36 - soothing relaxing chefs drink whoa
26:39 - there's a whole class watching Cooper
26:41 - where is your class from and hello to
26:46 - Cooper
26:47 - to Cooper's class all right so let's
26:51 - check our donations
26:57 - I will do some coding next if it says 83
27:02 - donors refresh fail Oh 84 all right good
27:16 - work everybody
27:17 - good work everybody all right everybody
27:23 - good work so let's thank those donors
27:27 - and then let's do a coding challenge
27:31 - because I I know that's what people are
27:33 - probably interested in hold on I've got
27:35 - to get to the donors page and thank you
27:41 - to Alejandro G Hevea thank you for
27:45 - donating to the processing foundation
27:46 - and thank you to mark Leonard thank you
27:51 - mark Leonard I will read some random
27:56 - numbers in honor of these last two
27:58 - deletions children I know you just woke
28:02 - up but this will be your new bedtime
28:04 - storybook when I see you next it is
28:07 - called a million random digits with
28:10 - 100,000 oral deviants and I will read a
28:13 - few like this 4282
28:18 - twenty five thousand one hundred eighty
28:22 - nine thousand one hundred seventy six
28:24 - eighty eight thousand one hundred
28:26 - eighty-five fifty two thousand three
28:28 - hundred and sixty one 665 785 seven
28:35 - thousand six hundred and twenty six five
28:40 - thousand four hundred
28:42 - 990 1144 14,000 738 good night sleep
28:53 - tight don't let the random numbers be
28:57 - have a pattern never let those random
28:59 - numbers have it just a pattern that you
29:01 - can find all right so but what else do I
29:06 - want to do I do I'm I did want to take a
29:08 - break to show you I'm just checking it
29:15 - ah Garron in the in the slack channel
29:19 - it's telling me that their name did not
29:22 - show up but I don't know maybe that
29:25 - takes some time to update maybe it runs
29:27 - a process Oh actually goron when I saw
29:30 - your donation it didn't have a public
29:33 - you missed filling out public names send
29:35 - me an email or later a DM and the flack
29:37 - channel I'll get that fixed for you ok
29:39 - ok I know everybody's telling me this
29:45 - sound is crack delaying I can't seem to
29:48 - do anything about it I could try
29:49 - stopping starting the stream or
29:51 - restarting computer one more time but I
29:53 - can I can assure you that the crackling
29:55 - sound is something that's happening
30:00 - after the video and audio goes out so I
30:04 - don't know what to do about that I'm
30:05 - gonna keep going
30:05 - ok so here's the thing I'm gonna go to
30:07 - rainbow topics and I am going to so I I
30:21 - found some coding challenges that I
30:23 - thought would be reasonable to do today
30:26 - that I felt I could handle some of them
30:28 - much harder than others so here's my
30:30 - list I'm not actually not gonna do all
30:32 - of these and I probably lucky if I get
30:33 - to one I have some more songs to sing
30:35 - and also by the way I wonder I'm just
30:43 - curious
30:43 - I wonder if people in certain regions
30:45 - are having the framerate and sound
30:48 - crackling issues or with certain service
30:50 - providers and telling you something's
30:52 - going on here net neutrality
30:55 - there's lots of buffering going on it's
30:58 - buffering it's buffering okay so so um
31:09 - anyway you guys can discuss that amongst
31:10 - yourselves in the chat now there's a
31:14 - couple things I could do I could just
31:16 - pick something I don't I don't know if
31:19 - falling snow is really a Christmas
31:21 - challenge that could just be like a
31:23 - wintry season challenge right but so I
31:28 - sort of feel like I should probably just
31:29 - do that one I could also put it up for a
31:32 - straw poll let people vote on which
31:34 - challenge they want to see I could also
31:36 - pick one randomly with my spinning wheel
31:38 - of random picking let's vote people are
31:43 - people are interested in voting all
31:51 - right
31:52 - I'm looking at the reading the chat I'm
31:55 - looking here what should we do vote vote
32:00 - pick randomly let's make a straw don't
32:04 - you think we should do the snow what if
32:06 - we left today and we didn't have a nice
32:08 - snowy wintry scene let's do the snow in
32:12 - fact dare I Christmas tree that responds
32:20 - to physics all right let's do the snow
32:25 - let's do this no but I there's a thing I
32:28 - would like this to be unlike most of my
32:31 - usual coding challenges I would like
32:34 - this to be I would love to have lots of
32:36 - suggestions so I want you to help me
32:38 - figure this out
32:39 - okay and then I'm gonna do something
32:42 - basic and not so wonderful and it will
32:45 - be the starting point for everybody's
32:47 - beautiful snowy wintery holiday scenes
32:50 - okay so I am going to put on some music
32:57 - for you as always I always forget to dis
33:00 - stop it stop it stop this done
33:11 - [Music]
33:19 - [Music]
33:40 - [Music]
33:52 - [Music]
33:59 - this star this star this star this start
34:02 - song never forget to this star somebody
34:05 - composed that song for me okay so we are
34:11 - going to make a nice snowy scene oh yeah
34:16 - so Alka loyal or I often like to say
34:20 - royal
34:23 - royal coding training viewer Alka has
34:28 - made a snow coding challenge it's called
34:31 - let's see if I can find it on this
34:33 - computer here code member 26 let's take
34:37 - a look at it snow mountains Alka which
34:41 - is going it's way better let's just see
34:44 - the code pen Alka let's try to find it
34:51 - oh you know what we've really got to
34:52 - plug this computer in battery is getting
34:55 - low and we all know I really need a new
34:57 - computer look at all these search snow
35:07 - there we go look at this so this is
35:13 - Alcon snow look what does this do but
35:18 - I'm going to do so what I would like to
35:19 - do is I want to do something that maybe
35:23 - I'll use like a texture maybe somebody
35:24 - wants to make a nice little some nice
35:26 - little PNG textures that look like snow
35:28 - and I'm gonna I want to have some larger
35:32 - ones and some smaller ones and have some
35:35 - kind of like parallax effect we're
35:36 - depending on how big or far they move
35:38 - faster or slower and maybe have a snow
35:40 - pile up a little bit on the ground that
35:43 - kind of thing so that's going to be the
35:45 - rest that's gonna be look at this ooh
35:47 - that's so lovely so this is this is
35:49 - pretty cool so we're gonna make our own
35:51 - version of this and so let's get started
35:55 - I was supposed to click to paint sorry
36:02 - everybody
36:04 - yeah this is basically the purple rain
36:06 - challenge I should probably just start
36:08 - from that but let's start over
36:19 - okay let's see
36:34 - hello welcome to a winter themed coating
36:37 - challenge you know something that I that
36:41 - I thought I should say is this coating
36:42 - challenge is probably very similar to my
36:45 - previous Purple Reign coating challenge
36:47 - but instead of Purple Reign we're going
36:50 - to have wintery white snow so I've got a
36:53 - blank p5.js sketch here I am going to
36:57 - try to make little snow particles that
36:59 - fall I'm getting some suggestions from
37:02 - the chat about like wind and that type
37:04 - of thing so let's just get started oh I
37:07 - got a nice PNG snowflake there okay so
37:10 - I'm getting lots of so this I don't know
37:12 - how this is gonna go you might be
37:13 - watching this as a recorded video
37:14 - sometime in the future from your
37:15 - spaceship that's flying around but but I
37:20 - at the time of this recording there's a
37:23 - live chat going on and I'm gonna try to
37:24 - get some good suggestions so the very
37:26 - first thing that I need to do this is my
37:28 - code that's all it is I'm gonna start
37:30 - with an object-oriented approach and I'm
37:32 - actually going to make a new JavaScript
37:34 - file and I'm gonna call that file
37:37 - snowflake dot Jas and I am going to make
37:43 - a class called snowflake and that class
37:50 - is going to have a constructor and it's
37:53 - going to have a position and all of
37:58 - these are going to be vector objects if
38:00 - you haven't seen a vector object yet a
38:01 - vector is an object that holds an X or Y
38:04 - and a Z because we could do this later
38:06 - maybe a part two in 3d and WebGL it
38:09 - could swirl around the snow and go
38:12 - through it in 3d oh boy wouldn't that be
38:13 - exciting but we need a velocity and we
38:17 - need an acceleration all right now also
38:23 - we want a function just to render the
38:27 - snowflake and for now I'm just gonna say
38:29 - it's white
38:33 - it's about four pixels wide and it is
38:36 - just a point and so the point will be at
38:39 - the position the X&Y position oh look at
38:44 - this I'm getting a wonderful sprite
38:47 - sheet of snow textures we're gonna grab
38:50 - that so thank you I'm seeing that being
38:52 - submitted Alka if you could make me a
38:54 - nice like URL that I can download it
38:57 - here as we're going alright so what do I
39:01 - want to do now okay
39:02 - so I definitely want to have an array so
39:07 - I'm gonna make an array empty array I'm
39:09 - to call it snow and what I'm gonna do is
39:12 - I'm gonna say snow dot push a new
39:17 - snowflake so I'm gonna have at least one
39:20 - new snowflake I'm gonna have one new
39:25 - snowflake and then I'm going to say for
39:29 - every flake in of snow right this is my
39:33 - new favorite kind of JavaScript loop
39:35 - where I have an array of many things and
39:37 - I could say for every element in that
39:40 - array but it's up in does something
39:42 - different oh I got to do a video about
39:43 - that cuz I really botched my previous
39:45 - one I'm gonna say snow oh no flake dot
39:49 - render and let's probably pass in never
39:56 - mind let's let's let's set the location
39:59 - of the snow in the constructor itself
40:01 - let's just hard coat it right now and
40:03 - let's see we get Oh snowflake is not too
40:07 - fine why is snowflake not defined
40:09 - because I forgot in my HTML file to
40:12 - reference that javascript file and I'm
40:20 - being told by Simon that maybe I have a
40:23 - syntax error somewhere I'm not sure
40:26 - where I'll let's just see what happens
40:30 - oh there it is there is a beautiful
40:34 - snowflake
40:37 - I have a keyboard now I don't know how
40:39 - to use it yet but very excited about
40:41 - this edition okay there is the beautiful
40:44 - snowflake now what I could do is I could
40:49 - actually say in draw let's keep adding
40:52 - snowflakes now I think I'm adding many
40:55 - many many snowflakes but they're all
40:57 - being added right in the same spot so
40:59 - let's add all of our snowflakes at a
41:02 - random location let's pick a random with
41:06 - a random exposition and a random Y
41:10 - position why is this associated with
41:23 - snow in my head or the winter or
41:24 - something anyway you don't need the
41:27 - paren if you are using es6 i still know
41:30 - you're referring to do simon give me a
41:31 - line number okay
41:33 - now here's the thing I think I want to
41:36 - create all my snowflakes above off the
41:39 - screen and have them fall down so let's
41:42 - do that
41:43 - so let's actually in the snowflake
41:45 - object let's create the Y location
41:48 - something like between negative 100 and
41:51 - negative 10 so somewhere above the
41:54 - window so now if I were to rerun this
41:55 - sketch I won't see any event but I can
41:58 - add a function I'm gonna call it update
42:01 - and what I'm going to do an update is
42:03 - I'm going to add the velocity to the
42:06 - position and breaking news - drew -
42:11 - breaking news somebody will think that
42:12 - sound effect eventually I now have our
42:16 - sprite sheet okay is that the right term
42:20 - I've actually never used one of these
42:21 - things before
42:22 - I always make separate files alko TV
42:25 - slash static slash f16 dot PNG oops
42:31 - alka TV static what did I get wrong
42:36 - there somebody tell me what I got wrong
42:37 - there all right I'll come back to it oh
42:41 - I spelled al-quran a LCA there we go
42:47 - so let me download this
42:51 - Desktop snow and call it flakes 16 okay
43:00 - so we've got some images we'll be able
43:01 - to use later great okay now though I
43:03 - would say is the position of each
43:05 - snowflake needs to change over time how
43:08 - about based on the object's velocity so
43:12 - I can use vector math to say add the
43:15 - velocity to the position every frame and
43:17 - so I can now say flake update I want
43:23 - them all to update now I still see them
43:26 - moving down because they none of them
43:27 - have a velocity so I could do something
43:28 - just to test and I could say hey give
43:31 - all of them a velocity vector that's
43:33 - kind of fast pointing down like zero
43:35 - comma five and we would see there's all
43:37 - the snow but this this this is not
43:40 - really snow yet right what we want I
43:43 - mean it's never going to be actual snow
43:45 - wouldn't it be wonderful like it's magic
43:47 - indeed or props have snow falling in but
43:50 - what I want is I want to see it feel a
43:54 - little bit more like gravity so what I'm
43:56 - going to do is I'm actually gonna create
43:59 - a global variable called gravity because
44:02 - gravity isn't part of a snowflake it's
44:04 - part of the world so to speak and I'm
44:07 - gonna say gravity equals create vector
44:09 - and I'm gonna make up something a little
44:12 - small gravity pointing down and then
44:15 - actually what I want to do is again I
44:18 - want the velocity to start at zero but I
44:22 - want the acceleration equal to gravity
44:27 - and I want to add the object's
44:30 - acceleration to its velocity so I'm
44:32 - gonna do more with this in a little bit
44:34 - but the idea is gravity is a force a
44:36 - force is a vector that moves an object
44:39 - with mass that accelerates an object
44:42 - with mass F equals n times n right so so
44:46 - what I want to do is take the gravity
44:48 - force and put it in the object
44:49 - acceleration which changes the velocity
44:51 - over time and what we would see now is
44:56 - snow starting to fall faster as it gets
44:59 - further down right so this is starting
45:01 - to look a little bit more like snow
45:03 - a lot more for us to do here we wanted
45:05 - we want to add some wind you know we
45:06 - probably want the gravity in the case of
45:09 - snow
45:10 - gravity's probably the wrong word I
45:12 - should just to be very light so it feels
45:16 - like it's moving very very slowly
45:18 - however hmm I wanted to create this
45:23 - parallax effect so how do I do that okay
45:34 - so so how do I do that let's think about
45:38 - this well one thing I would like to do
45:40 - is give the the give this the snowflakes
45:45 - themselves some kind of size so let's
45:48 - try this let's give them a property
45:51 - called R that's a random number between
45:53 - four and eight and use that as the
45:55 - stroke weight and we can see now this is
45:59 - kind of nice right so this is nice now
46:02 - somebody in the chat oh I don't know
46:04 - want some help here so what do I want
46:07 - I want the bigger ones falling slower
46:11 - and the smaller ones falling faster no
46:13 - the other way around if something's
46:15 - further away it's smaller and it will
46:17 - look like it's falling slower if it's
46:19 - bigger it's closer or look like it's
46:20 - falling faster is that right and so
46:22 - should I actually just alter the gravity
46:27 - like let's make a copy of the gravity
46:30 - vector so one thing I should do okay so
46:33 - first of all I should write a function
46:35 - called apply force and that takes a
46:38 - force and what it does is it just adds
46:40 - that force to the object's acceleration
46:43 - big and then I clear out the
46:47 - acceleration every frame so this is
46:50 - known as force accumulation I have lots
46:51 - of videos that go through this in more
46:52 - detail but the idea if there's different
46:55 - techniques for doing this that what I
46:56 - want to do is say there's a bunch of
46:57 - forces in the world I want to accumulate
47:00 - all of those forces so so like I might
47:04 - have some wind I might have some gravity
47:06 - so and we megawatts I'm like Perlin
47:08 - noise flow field kind of thing yes I
47:11 - need to have a mass and although people
47:14 - are giving me great suggestion to the
47:15 - job
47:16 - to get to those not ready yet so what I
47:19 - really want to do is I just want to say
47:21 - flake apply force gravity because
47:25 - gravity is a force that's coming from
47:26 - outside that I want to send into each
47:28 - snowflake so this should really be the
47:30 - same exact the same exact sketch now
47:34 - we've really got to fix something before
47:35 - we get too far so number one is IV
47:38 - either want to like recycle the
47:40 - snowflakes when they get to the bottom
47:41 - or remove them because as you know this
47:43 - is already running really slow after a
47:45 - little while let's deal with that so
47:47 - what I want to do is I want to loop and
47:55 - actually I'm going to do this thing that
47:57 - I do in lots of coding challenges where
48:00 - I'm gonna loop through an array
48:02 - backwards and I'm gonna say if flake
48:08 - off-screen snow dot splice I can't type
48:19 - today I comma one so what am i doing so
48:22 - what I'm doing here is I want to go
48:24 - through every miss flake if snow index I
48:27 - is off-screen so I need to use an
48:30 - iterator a counter to go through all the
48:33 - elements of the array because I want to
48:35 - eventually use the splice function which
48:37 - removes something from the array and the
48:40 - thing that it removes i specify the
48:41 - index I want to remove the snowflake at
48:44 - that index and just just the one I don't
48:46 - want to remove the one the one after and
48:48 - I'm going through the array backwards so
48:50 - as I remove them the array slides down
48:53 - and is shorter and I don't end up
48:54 - missing any elements definitely done
48:56 - this in other videos before ok time out
49:00 - for a second I have to blow my nose we
49:03 - all know how I always get the sniffles
49:08 - ok so this isn't going to work because
49:11 - this idea of sewing off-screen isn't
49:14 - magic so I need to go back to the
49:16 - snowflake object and I need to write a
49:19 - function called off-screen and yeah I'm
49:25 - being told breaking news I'm being told
49:28 - that I have I plus plus somewhere
49:30 - where I need I - - I will fix that it
49:33 - definitely would result in a problematic
49:35 - infinite loop I now want to say return
49:41 - of the boolean value of if it's
49:43 - off-screen and I can determine that by
49:45 - saying this dot pause dot Y is greater
49:48 - than is it greater than height plus this
49:52 - dot R so in other words if it's off the
49:57 - screen based on its size then then
50:00 - return this will evaluate to true or
50:02 - false if it's true it's off the screen
50:03 - all right all right back to sketch now
50:06 - this definitely needs to be I - - thank
50:09 - you for that correction and now let's
50:12 - rerun this sketch all right now
50:18 - the question is let's look at the length
50:21 - of the array 194 193 so that's
50:24 - definitely working it's kind of hovering
50:27 - around 200 particles which is reasonable
50:29 - to render that's good okay so now I
50:32 - think what I want is let's try to get
50:36 - that parallax effect let's see if we can
50:38 - make that happen so what what would
50:42 - happen if I before I send in the force
50:47 - oh so interestingly enough I'm ignoring
50:54 - an aspect of Newton's law so typically I
50:57 - might do something like this
51:07 - right what did I just do here what I
51:09 - said is before I take that incoming
51:12 - force and add it to the acceleration
51:13 - divided it by mass and that's because
51:17 - whoops timeout for a second everybody
51:30 - hold on why is this camera view not
51:36 - working hmm interesting
51:44 - so I seem to have lost the whiteboard
51:47 - camera I guess I don't need it right now
51:53 - hmm boy so many technical difficulties
51:56 - today force equals mass times
52:04 - acceleration or acceleration equals
52:06 - force divided by mass so this is me
52:08 - dividing it by mass now of course with
52:11 - gravity ha the force of gravity is
52:15 - scaled by mass because force of gravity
52:19 - equals the mass of one of your times it
52:20 - matters another object divided by just
52:22 - the squared so this is kind of actually
52:23 - irrelevant here this is problematic so
52:27 - I'm going to not include this right now
52:29 - but what I'm actually going to do is I
52:34 - am going to I'm gonna like have a little
52:37 - like parallax is that how you spell it
52:42 - parallax effect hack let's see if this
52:45 - works
52:47 - somebody will hopefully help me with
52:51 - this I really need up with this so what
52:54 - I want to do is I want to make a copy of
52:56 - that incoming force then I just want to
52:59 - I'm just gonna multiply it by the object
53:03 - size because if it's bigger
53:05 - I want that force to appear let it and
53:07 - that it's stronger and then I'm gonna do
53:10 - that so let's this let's see if let's
53:11 - see what this does
53:17 - mm I think it's not strong enough and
53:20 - also there's kind of an issue where yeah
53:26 - let's let's make this size differential
53:28 - much more extreme
53:37 - that's sort of like kind of I forgot to
53:43 - set the terminal velocity that's a good
53:44 - point
53:45 - so I should have the snow have a
53:47 - terminal velocity and that terminal
53:50 - velocity so let's let's try that let's
53:53 - see if we can make this this dot
53:55 - terminal V equals this dot R we're gonna
54:01 - make it related to its size I don't need
54:04 - another variable let's try that okay so
54:10 - let's see I'm sorry I'm very thrown off
54:12 - by the so I want to say this dot
54:15 - velocity dot limit this dot R so the
54:23 - limit is a vector function that takes a
54:25 - given vector and limits the length of it
54:27 - so let's see how this what this does
54:34 - what do we think does this sort of seem
54:38 - like
54:38 - parallax II snow
54:49 - I'm pausing for no given reason oh I'm
54:52 - being told to maybe try lowering the mic
54:53 - maybe that will help people let me see
54:56 - if I can do that okay lowered the mic a
55:04 - little bit too much speed yes way too
55:09 - much speed right so let's say it's
55:14 - limited by its size times point like 20
55:17 - percent of its size that's better right
55:25 - that seems more like snow very nice all
55:31 - right let's see if we can use a sprite
55:33 - sheet now really as an exercise to
55:35 - yourself if you're watching this and
55:37 - you're falling along you should stop
55:40 - right now and limit the velocity to the
55:46 - same value for every snowflake then
55:48 - multiply to do the parallel but is it
55:49 - limiting it to the to a different value
55:52 - for every snowflake the same as doing
55:53 - the parallax anyway I'm happy with this
55:55 - more small ones and fewer big ones okay
55:58 - great suggestion so how do we do that
56:01 - oh I love this suggestion how do we have
56:03 - pick a random number that's more likely
56:06 - to be small than big
56:11 - [Music]
56:25 - okay oh so I have stopped it I Paul I'm
56:28 - pausing again how do we make pick a
56:31 - random number that's more likely to be
56:33 - small than big so there's a variety of
56:36 - ways of doing this I feel like I've made
56:39 - many videos on this in the past so so
56:51 - I'm sorry I'm looking at the chat
56:57 - logarithmic scale is good people getting
56:59 - good suggestions logarithmic scale
57:01 - random Gaussian I could do random
57:03 - Gaussian I could use the exponential
57:06 - function or I could kind of do the two
57:11 - random numbers of so many possibilities
57:14 - mm-hmm how about let's just say let's
57:24 - write a function called get random size
57:28 - and I'm gonna just put that separately
57:31 - up here function get random size and
57:35 - what I'm going to do now is let's do the
57:39 - pick two random numbers approach this
57:41 - whole this will kind of be easy so I
57:49 - want to pick two random numbers and I'm
57:52 - going to say if random 2 is less than
57:57 - random 1 or its greater than weight
58:00 - weight weight is greater than random 1
58:06 - so smaller numbers will be more often
58:09 - then return random 1 while true so this
58:22 - isn't very efficient I feel like there's
58:23 - so many other more efficient techniques
58:25 - but basically basically what I'm doing
58:27 - is I am trying to pick two random
58:31 - numbers 1 which qualifies the other one
58:34 - so
58:37 - so in other words let's say I pick a
58:40 - point one well now I need pick a second
58:44 - random number point one is going to make
58:46 - it past this level 90% of the time
58:48 - point two is going to make it past
58:49 - eighty percent of the time point eight
58:51 - is only gonna make it past twenty
58:52 - percent of the time so this is linear
58:54 - but I think it'll do pretty well for now
58:56 - and then I want to map that value which
58:59 - has a value between zero and one and so
59:01 - I don't really need to map it I'm just a
59:03 - random one times 36
59:05 - so now we should have more smaller ones
59:11 - and you can kind of see this is true
59:14 - right there's a lot more smaller ones
59:16 - than big ones now maybe that
59:21 - distribution still is too strong and I
59:24 - could say random one squared right
59:32 - wouldn't this make it even less likely
59:34 - to do big ones I can't tell visually if
59:36 - that's the case it's hard to see because
59:38 - the big ones move so fast so I'm like
59:47 - reading the chat so but what do you guys
59:51 - think of this all right I'm gonna leave
60:00 - this I'm just curious
60:08 - - let's do to the tenth power see I
60:14 - think this isn't doing what I wanted to
60:15 - do because I can't use the whiteboard
60:20 - it's my problem right now why is the
60:22 - whiteboard camera failing sorry my - I'm
60:26 - making an editing challenge for you
60:35 - they should flutter from side to side
60:37 - yeah I will do that
60:38 - why is this sorry I just want to like
60:45 - investigate the whiteboard we're not
60:47 - going to make it through today without
60:57 - the whiteboard camera what time is it oh
61:06 - my god thirty twelve twenty not so much
61:09 - for my telethon of coding challenges
61:14 - let's see here let me just if you don't
61:17 - mind bearing with me for a second
61:30 - that works what sorry
61:33 - ooh what happened to me whoa I'm missing
61:46 - something why am I having so many
61:48 - technical difficulties today whoa do you
62:01 - guys see me that's moving oh wait for it
62:10 - the smaller ones come into the screen a
62:11 - lot later because of the parallax effect
62:13 - ah interesting so you know what I should
62:16 - do yeah you don't see me right yeah
62:19 - weird right I'm gonna have to restart
62:22 - OBS again which I'm happy to do just
62:25 - because of all of this stuff yeah that's
62:31 - so weird I'm restarting OBS this stream
62:33 - is about to go down we'll come right
62:35 - back I'm not gonna restart the computer
62:47 - I think I'm back sorry everybody
62:51 - I don't have the live check I did
62:53 - actually have to restart the computer
62:54 - I'm hoping maybe all that popping stuff
62:57 - got fixed I can't get the whiteboard
62:59 - camera which is probably fine stream
63:01 - health it says it's good
63:03 - I do see a weird framerate yeah I see
63:08 - the frame rate issue in my preview and
63:15 - the topping is still happening so weird
63:18 - I've never had some few people watching
63:21 - oh and I think I just froze no I'm just
63:24 - behind this is like a this live stream
63:27 - that's good it's actually quite good
63:28 - that nobody's watching let me pop the
63:33 - chat out I mean I know there are there's
63:35 - a hundred of you watching but um and
63:37 - which is like used to be like breaking
63:40 - all my records but now I'm used to
63:42 - having a few hundred people watching all
63:47 - right I I don't know what to do
63:52 - buffering green whoops sorry okay
64:04 - all right I am 423 people are watching
64:09 - oh ok nevermind
64:13 - everybody turn this off this is really
64:15 - big
64:16 - this is my big like I was actually
64:18 - trying to do like a whole curated
64:20 - scripted holiday show ok I should power
64:23 - are to not r1 all right well I'm just
64:27 - gonna have to hope that this is somehow
64:32 - the recording is going to be fine all
64:34 - right no need for the one I just I want
64:37 - to use the whiteboard but it's fine this
64:39 - is probably be the only coded challenge
64:40 - today anyway holiday special coding snow
64:43 - ok so a nice suggestion from the chat is
64:47 - maybe is to try powering our - right
64:50 - because I want that oh that makes sense
64:52 - no I say if I could use a whiteboard
64:55 - this is how I think these think these
64:58 - things trip through but let's um
65:01 - let's square r2 and take a look at what
65:05 - we see now one thing that's interesting
65:10 - here is I think that actually just to
65:11 - see what's going on it would be much
65:14 - more helpful if I just started them all
65:16 - on the screen so we can see the
65:17 - distribution more clearly so I now I
65:21 - don't want them to start on the screen
65:24 - though but what I could do I have an
65:28 - idea is that I can give it some optional
65:33 - arguments and that so I could just start
65:41 - the first I could start with what I'm
65:45 - gonna do is start with a so this is one
65:49 - way to say like oh well if I give an X
65:51 - into the constructor then use that if I
65:54 - don't then pick something randomly it's
65:57 - a little bit of a problem because if I
65:58 - give a 0 it's still gonna pick something
66:00 - randomly but I'm not gonna worry about
66:01 - that right now what I'm going to do here
66:05 - is I'm gonna start with just a whole
66:08 - bunch of them let's start with 200 and
66:12 - I'm going to give them start with 200 on
66:17 - the screen just I want to see that
66:18 - distribution to really get a good sense
66:24 - for it
66:31 - oops okay where where did I get that
66:37 - error this X has already been declared
66:39 - in setup where once again sketch line
66:49 - number one well what what
66:59 - remove the let in the constructor oh of
67:05 - course
67:06 - this won't work
67:10 - snow X snow y okay that doesn't work
67:19 - because I can't have the same variable
67:22 - with the time off my game here okay all
67:25 - right
67:26 - how does this look as a distribution
67:27 - let's see if we can make this I actually
67:29 - kind of liked it but let's see if we can
67:31 - make this a bit more extreme let's go to
67:34 - this and say that's power our two to the
67:40 - tenth so this is fewer so I thought that
67:44 - doesn't seem like it works for me
67:46 - I really think it should be this oh no
67:52 - so that that actually was the opposite
67:54 - all right I'm reading the chat I kind of
68:08 - like this no actually I feel like this
68:11 - is good enough it's gonna be much better
68:13 - once I do that so okay
68:16 - not you you you can do some editing
68:19 - magic with this because I've I kind of I
68:23 - lost my with all the technical
68:24 - difficulties I've been kind of losing my
68:26 - steam in momentum which means it's time
68:29 - for
68:30 - I should take a break and sing another
68:31 - Christmas song holiday song as any yeah
68:44 - you know this is actually a really good
68:46 - point it's sort of a little silly that
68:48 - I'm deleting the elements from the array
68:50 - where I could just recycle them back to
68:52 - the top but I do feel like at least and
68:55 - I can also give them a new random size
68:57 - but I'm gonna I'm gonna keep it this way
68:58 - just in terms of being a little bit more
69:00 - flexible all right so yeah there should
69:07 - be less large snowflakes so what are
69:11 - some of my other technique
69:13 - for picking a non-uniform distribution
69:16 - of random numbers I need the whiteboard
69:21 - I said I could just draw this and I
69:25 - would know exactly what it is that I
69:26 - want to do I want them to actually I
69:29 - want that distribution to be yeah I'm
69:42 - thinking
69:46 - Payne Perlin noise absolute value of
69:49 - Gaussian oh that's excellent okay Lucas
69:54 - in the chat is giving me an excellent
69:56 - suggestion which is to use the absolute
69:59 - value of a Gaussian distribution let's
70:01 - try that so what I'm going to do is I'm
70:05 - gonna comment this solution out and I'm
70:11 - going to give myself a random Gaussian
70:15 - number so they're in p5 there is a
70:18 - function that will give you a Gaussian
70:20 - distribution which is a normalized
70:21 - distribution or the bell curve and I can
70:23 - change I can alter the mean or the
70:25 - standard deviation so I could say the
70:28 - mean I want the mean to be zero but but
70:34 - I want to the standard deviation to be
70:36 - let's call it 36 so I'm going to say R
70:41 - equals random Gaussian times 36 I'm
70:46 - going to scale it up and then I'm going
70:48 - to return the absolute value because
70:50 - random Gaussian will give me negative
70:52 - numbers all centered around 0 and will
70:55 - give me a lot more smaller ones than
70:57 - larger ones let's take a look at this
70:59 - whoa that's a lot more so I don't want
71:02 - that standard deviation that big
71:04 - I suppose I could also square it you
71:16 - know I don't want the and then yeah this
71:22 - is kind of now I'm kind of getting
71:24 - somewhere in that those are really quite
71:32 - large
71:42 - okay so this is another technique I'm
71:44 - kind of I'm kind of liking this now so
71:47 - we can see that I have many smaller ones
71:49 - and fewer large ones so you can see
71:51 - there's a variety of ways to do emergent
71:59 - is also telling me oh my goodness why
72:00 - didn't I think of this I can just pick a
72:03 - random number and then square or power
72:06 - that number to make it exponential and
72:09 - then take one minus R of that number
72:12 - would actually probably work because
72:14 - it'll distribute more towards zero so I
72:16 - could try that but I am kind of liking
72:19 - how this looks it is running very slow
72:21 - over time so why is it running so slow
72:23 - over time because I have many many
72:28 - snowflakes and in fact I'm adding so
72:30 - many but they these small ones never
72:32 - really get to the bottom so one thing I
72:34 - need to do is I need to in addition to
72:38 - having a a maximum velocity I also want
72:47 - to say if this dot velocity magnitude
72:55 - magnitude is greater than is less than
73:01 - one this dot velocity normalize okay so
73:12 - and is it I don't think it's possible
73:14 - because there's some and I also think
73:17 - that I want to say so actually do you
73:24 - know what I can do I don't actually need
73:26 - to do this limiting here I think I don't
73:29 - want to ever create a snowflake that's
73:31 - less than like two pixels so another
73:34 - thing that I could do is I can constrain
73:36 - that absolute value squared between two
73:41 - pixels and 36 pixels so now because you
73:46 - can see there were just so so many small
73:47 - ones and so this now if we look at the
73:50 - size you know I'm staying
73:52 - it's getting bigger over time but I'm
73:57 - hopefully staying a bit more within the
73:59 - realm of reason okay yeah look how many
74:07 - small so I think though that I do need
74:09 - the minimum velocity to be more than so
74:18 - they get limited by their size times
74:22 - point two and so I do think that I want
74:30 - them to move at least let's try let's
74:32 - try something
74:42 - this velocity dot that dot normalize
74:48 - okay so this should be better
75:03 - but I can also really fix the number by
75:07 - as everybody is suggesting by just
75:09 - recycling them so let's try that
75:13 - let's try instead of deleting them let's
75:20 - just create a function in the snowflake
75:24 - called randomize and what that function
75:30 - is going to do is actually all of this
75:34 - stuff
75:44 - and so when when this dot pause dot Y is
75:56 - greater than C merging if I had just had
76:00 - the whiteboard I was drawn that breath
76:02 - and it would have made more sense if
76:04 - this dot pause I Y is greater than
76:06 - height plus this dot R then this dot
76:11 - randomized so I'm just going to recycle
76:14 - these once I get to the bottom I'm gonna
76:16 - recycle them back up to the top this way
76:18 - I can really control the number of
76:21 - snowflakes I kind of want to just start
76:24 - this whole challenge over so let's let's
76:26 - have 300 and let's see what happens so
76:32 - this is going to consistently only ever
76:34 - have 300 what's a little bit interesting
76:36 - about this is that the smaller ones
76:39 - takes so long to get to the bottom well
76:43 - I'm still adding them so one thing that
76:45 - I need to do is stop adding them if I'm
76:47 - gonna do this approach and this we
76:50 - should see over time we're gonna have
76:53 - very few large ones so that distribution
76:56 - is actually going to be even smaller
76:58 - because this the small ones takes so
77:02 - long to go anyway so so they like stay
77:05 - on the screen so actually I'm going to
77:07 - alter the distribution a little bit and
77:14 - let's look at what we're doing here with
77:16 - random size and do this with so many so
77:26 - many no no that's no good
77:27 - so let's let's keep squaring it let's do
77:30 - one more let's do one more way of
77:37 - changing the size I'm just going to pick
77:42 - a random number between 0 and 1 and I'm
77:46 - going to square that number and I'm
77:51 - going to return 1 minus R so this is now
77:55 - if I had a whiteboard I could diagram
77:57 - this
78:00 - okay hmm
78:03 - oh but I need to scale that up by 36 so
78:07 - you can see what this looks like it's
78:09 - hard to tell but there should be many
78:11 - fewer now let me put that to the tenth
78:14 - power I did something wrong
78:25 - not one minus R why did I think was one
78:27 - minus R oh yeah there we go this is what
78:32 - I mention - and what I actually want to
78:35 - do is have at least a minimum size of
78:39 - 0.1 there this is pretty good let's have
78:44 - a minimum size of 0.2
78:49 - besides 0.5 I'm just curious here all
78:52 - right okay so I think this now is
78:59 - working pretty well and actually what I
79:02 - want to do is constrain that result to
79:05 - between two pixels and 36 and want
79:08 - anything less than two pixels there we
79:11 - go okay this is starting to look pretty
79:15 - good
79:15 - boy have I spent power ten is a bit
79:18 - large I didn't realize I did that I had
79:21 - that in there okay but I kind of liked
79:23 - it with that distribution
79:33 - so if I'm going to constrain it then I
79:35 - can do this okay let's see how this
79:39 - looks so anyway we've seen so many
79:41 - different ways of creating more values
79:46 - that are smaller than larger and I'm
79:49 - gonna leave this one in here as this
79:51 - kind of simplest solution which is just
79:53 - to take a random value between 0 & 1 and
79:55 - make that exponential so I'm much more
79:59 - likely to pick a smaller one than a
80:02 - large one because it is squaring and
80:04 - value less than 1 is making that value
80:06 - smaller but I'm actually doing it to the
80:08 - 5th power that sort of thing okay so
80:12 - this is by the way I think I'm gonna
80:14 - come back in the new year and just do
80:16 - this do this challenge over again and
80:18 - just this will just be for the live
80:21 - stream maybe because I've lost now ok so
80:24 - now what I want to do is finally go and
80:26 - let's try to use this sprite sheet so
80:30 - Alka I think generously I think there's
80:36 - a 30 to 1 so this is going to be good
80:41 - it's going to be I'm gonna do this
80:42 - flakes 32 dot PNG so if I understand
80:48 - what this image is correctly it is a
80:54 - whole bunch of snowflake designs that
80:57 - are 32 by 32 pixels now again I would
81:00 - like to suggest that you as a viewer
81:02 - generate these algorithmically but I'm
81:05 - just gonna copy them from this image so
81:07 - I've actually never done this before
81:09 - this is a way of you know it's I what I
81:11 - would always do is just load these those
81:13 - all separate images it's obviously much
81:14 - better to low just a single image file
81:16 - and see if I can copy the pieces of it
81:18 - so let's see if this works
81:20 - ooh boy this is exciting okay so so
81:23 - let's go to here let's add preload I'm
81:30 - gonna call this I'm gonna call this
81:33 - textures and I'm gonna say textures
81:40 - equals load image F 30 flakes 30 2 p.m.
81:47 - gee okay
81:50 - so let's first just make sure that that
81:51 - image is there let's see that it's there
82:00 - oh oh
82:03 - zero zero let's draw it at zero zero
82:06 - okay so we can see that that image is
82:08 - there so I'm getting all of these
82:12 - snowflake images which is absolutely
82:15 - lovely and what I want to do now is copy
82:20 - them into separate images so I'm gonna
82:25 - call this files and I'm gonna call and
82:28 - make another array called textures of
82:30 - file to call this file and what I want
82:35 - to do is I want to say for every X all
82:40 - the way up to I guess we could call this
82:44 - sprite sheet is that the it's not an
82:48 - array why did I set it as an array I'm
82:50 - losing my mind it's an image it's an
82:55 - image the textures will be an array I
82:57 - want to load that one image and then
83:00 - chop it up and I'm sure there's a way to
83:03 - do this autumn autumn attica lee with
83:04 - some library or something but i'm gonna
83:05 - do it manually here so i'm going to load
83:07 - that image and then i'm gonna want to go
83:10 - through the width of that image x plus
83:16 - equal 32 so i'm going to assume that
83:18 - each one of those is 32 by 32 and then i
83:21 - want to go through the y
83:30 - and then what I want to do is I want to
83:33 - get a new image I want to say an image
83:36 - is spritesheet get now what's the chance
83:40 - that this works spritesheet get X comma
83:44 - Y 3232
83:46 - this should pull out a slice the get
83:49 - function in p5 should pull out a slice
83:51 - of that image a little square just from
83:54 - that position and then I can say
83:57 - textures dot push that image all right
84:04 - now here's the thing I want to debug to
84:07 - see that this is really working so I'm
84:09 - gonna just get rid of I'm gonna get rid
84:11 - of the draw function completely and what
84:14 - I also want to do is I am going to draw
84:17 - these images at their X&Y location so
84:20 - let's see if this actually works if the
84:22 - get function does what I wanted to do
84:24 - hmm
84:25 - now I probably need a can't tell if it
84:28 - work because there's no background ah it
84:31 - worked so the get function you can
84:33 - notice it took a little while there
84:35 - because it had to like chop everything
84:36 - up that was kind of a slow process but
84:38 - this actually worked so now I have an
84:40 - array of all those images I can put the
84:47 - draw function back I now what I want to
84:51 - do actually I need to do this beforehand
84:56 - and then what I want to do is give each
84:59 - one a design which is a random texture
85:02 - and I'm going to pass that design in and
85:06 - each snowflake is going to get that
85:12 - design as an image and I that probably
85:18 - should put it in the randomize but let's
85:20 - just get this to work and I'm now going
85:22 - to say instead of drawing it let's say
85:27 - image mode center and then whoops image
85:34 - mode center then I want to draw that
85:36 - image it's current image at with its
85:41 - size
85:42 - okay dare this work oh boy what just
85:47 - happened oh I didn't draw it at the
85:48 - right position I also got to include its
85:54 - position and there we go look at all the
86:00 - snowflakes now I almost feel like I need
86:02 - because they're so lightweight I kind of
86:05 - feel like I need more big bigger ones so
86:10 - I could go back to one of my ridiculous
86:17 - other techniques or I could just lower
86:20 - this let's just square that random
86:23 - number so I have more big ones but
86:26 - that's too many big ones and I should
86:29 - probably constrain it to 32 cuz that's
86:36 - the maximum size there look it's our
86:40 - snow
86:49 - [Music]
86:55 - okay so there we've made a nice book
87:02 - what did it take me like an hour it's
87:03 - like 12:45 I was gonna wrap this up
87:05 - around one o'clock this has been kind of
87:08 - a disaster of a live stream but I do
87:10 - appreciate that so many people donate it
87:12 - and I'm gonna come back to the but I
87:14 - think that it would I was gonna try to
87:16 - add a little Perlin noise wind so I'm
87:23 - seeing in the chat that quality seems to
87:25 - be a little bit of an issue here so I
87:27 - don't know maybe there's a way that I
87:29 - can improve that I don't know if that
87:30 - has to do well we could wrote rotate the
87:35 - snowflakes rotate
87:37 - so when you say rotate do you mean do
87:44 - you mean have them spin as they're
87:46 - follow it falling or all have a random
87:48 - rotation also has rotation and floating
87:53 - but sine waves make them go side to side
87:59 - a little okay well let's try them
88:04 - spinning so I don't understand how this
88:06 - is gonna make it look more like snow but
88:08 - let's try it I meant to take breaks and
88:11 - talk about the processing foundation I'm
88:13 - doing a terrible job at this fundraiser
88:16 - both rotation and spinning okay so let's
88:18 - do that so let's let's go here and add a
88:22 - variable called angle which can be a
88:26 - random angle between zero and 2pi and
88:30 - I'm going to in when I draw the
88:34 - snowflake I want to say a push translate
88:40 - this dot pause dot X this dot pause dot
88:46 - Y and then draw the image instead at
88:48 - zero zero and then have pop and then
88:53 - after I translate I want to rotate by
88:55 - some angle okay so let's just take a
88:58 - look at this first whoops what did I
89:01 - miss
89:02 - angle is not defined surprise this
89:13 - doesn't happen to me yet okay so I don't
89:19 - know if you can tell are they rotated at
89:21 - random angles it looks like they are
89:24 - yeah I'm definitely gonna do the noise
89:26 - function don't worry everybody it's
89:28 - coming
89:29 - so let's now let's have them rotate
89:35 - based on their velocities magnitude I
89:38 - don't know and that's way too much
89:43 - because we're in if I went to angle mode
89:46 - degrees but I could just divide that by
89:48 - a hundred they're all rotating in the
89:53 - same direction that doesn't seem right
89:56 - so let's have them oops
90:10 - let's have them let's have them some of
90:19 - them go a randomly to the other
90:21 - direction so let's also have a direction
90:30 - and then oh let me I should write one of
90:33 - those fancy things right were you how do
90:36 - you do that where I have the little
90:37 - boolean thing if random one is is
90:40 - greater than 0.5 I give it a value of 1
90:43 - or like negative 1 what's this thing
90:45 - called then everybody always uses in
90:46 - complains that I don't that I don't use
90:51 - yeah I'm getting some mess so one thing
90:54 - that you guys could help me out when
90:55 - you're posting pigs in the patron group
90:57 - is unless the image is really important
91:00 - to like remove the remove the previews
91:04 - because I can't involve a chat with
91:07 - these big freebies in their ternary
91:10 - operator yeah so someone who some I
91:12 - never use these because I
91:15 - just an old-fashioned and pride probably
91:17 - so turnery operation encode turnery
91:21 - let's look at the ternary operation
91:23 - syntax JavaScript I mean it's the same
91:27 - and most okay to look at it like this ah
91:31 - this is the condition and if it's true
91:34 - it's this one if it's false it's this
91:35 - one so what I want to say is this right
91:42 - if random is greater than 0.5 give it a
91:46 - value of 1 otherwise negative 1 alright
91:48 - so I think this should work because now
91:50 - I want to change the angle and this
91:54 - should be an update by the way I want to
91:58 - change the angle by this times this dot
92:02 - Direction times this so some of them
92:04 - will go randomly to the other side okay
92:09 - so this is nice with them spinning now
92:20 - you
92:21 - yeah okay so now I want to do some
92:28 - side-to-side motion so some options are
92:31 - sine wave pearl and noise wind actual
92:35 - like a wind force what does everybody
92:39 - think Perlin noise wind they spin too
92:42 - fast
92:43 - it is kind of fast right so let's make
92:49 - them spin slower sine Alka is suggesting
92:57 - a sine wave so a sine wave just to have
93:01 - them sway left and right like not as a
93:04 - force but as just an oscillating motion
93:08 - interesting I have not tried this so I
93:13 - then would need to have some sort of
93:17 - offset which is the result of sine of
93:21 - maybe that angle I don't know I said
93:26 - random when I map
93:28 - oh I don't actually need to map because
93:30 - sine goes between negative 1 and 1 times
93:33 - maybe I could use their size and then I
93:37 - can just so I need they need to have an
93:41 - off South X offset which is 0 I'm gonna
93:45 - make this a property of the object and
93:51 - then I'm going to just use that
94:02 - and let's see what happens here whoops
94:06 - what did I miss what do I get wrong here
94:10 - angle is not defined this dot angle okay
94:21 - let's try this
94:24 - whoo what do we think of this so I could
94:38 - also have them do this with a little
94:39 - wind this is pretty nice this is turning
94:42 - out quite lovely
94:43 - let me get rid of the console
94:55 - [Music]
95:02 - this is actually quite nice alright now
95:05 - we really I really want to put some wind
95:07 - in here
95:10 - goodbye bitrate this is so sad this is
95:13 - like the worst idea for a coding
95:15 - challenge on YouTube because it's just
95:17 - going to make everything is by the way
95:18 - it's the popping and the framerate is
95:20 - all still bad I assume right alright so
95:26 - what I want to do now is add a little
95:32 - wind let's add a force if it falls
95:37 - slower it'll be less noticeable so let's
95:42 - have where am I
95:46 - where's them where is the speed at which
95:48 - it falls is here so I can actually make
95:52 - the fastest ones fall even slower but I
95:59 - kind of liked it now there's not enough
96:01 - differential I think between I'm gonna
96:06 - leave it as it was okay so here we go I
96:10 - want to have a little console here now
96:13 - what can I add I want to create some
96:17 - Perlin noise wind so the first thing I
96:20 - just want to see is let me just create
96:22 - some global wind so in draw let me
96:29 - create a vector variable called wind
96:32 - create vector and I am going to have
96:38 - that be the wind X is going to be just
96:44 - going to control a font from the mouse
96:47 - and I'm going to create a vector with
96:51 - that I'm going to create a vector and
96:53 - then I'm going to also apply that force
96:59 - so I create a vector so I just want to
97:02 - see how this looks so you can see this
97:07 - wind is much too strong and it's also
97:11 - very uniform so that's not good but it
97:15 - is kind of it's the right idea so let's
97:18 - just I just want to sort of see what the
97:20 - range of magnitude that makes sense is
97:25 - oh one issue is because I'm constraining
97:33 - them with like a top speed if the X
97:38 - force takes over they are not falling
97:40 - anymore hmm
97:41 - so I really should oh this is so
97:44 - problematic my all my weird constraints
97:48 - in here but let's make the wind much
97:49 - weaker so with a weaker wind so okay so
97:56 - this is kind of it there's a little
97:57 - there's some issues here because as they
98:00 - start to accelerate more and more the
98:02 - but I think as long as I keep the wind
98:04 - fairly weak we're gonna be fine here but
98:08 - I could probably do a better job with
98:10 - the constraining now what if I now have
98:15 - the wind be purlins noisy so instead I'm
98:23 - gonna have and I'm gonna do this in a
98:27 - weird sort of way because what I want
98:30 - also is I want I kind of want to have
98:33 - more of a flow field kind of wind so
98:36 - it's different all over and I could also
98:41 - have the wind pushing it down a little
98:43 - bit with the wind I could have the wind
98:47 - be a vector Oh an angle whew okay this
98:50 - is really good
98:51 - so actually hold on this so let me
98:57 - change this let me have a X offset equal
99:02 - to zero and now what I'm going to do is
99:05 - I am going to say let wind wind angle
99:10 - equal noise of X offset times 2pi
99:21 - then I'm going to make a vector from
99:26 - that angle and then I'm just gonna I'm
99:33 - gonna do that right now and then I'm
99:34 - gonna let X offset and I should control
99:38 - it by the mouse just to see if this is
99:40 - working but let's let that X offset go
99:42 - up in time so you can see this is kind
99:46 - of like nuts because it's changing so
99:50 - often and it's quite strong so if some
99:52 - things that I need to do are number one
99:54 - is shrink that shrink that wind down by
100:00 - quite a bit and also have it change less
100:05 - often so and now you can see it's
100:12 - totally uniform so I really don't want
100:16 - to have the same wind for each snowflake
100:18 - oh and of course now I have to have the
100:21 - snowflakes wrap so and and if I'd wrap I
100:24 - don't mean rap music wise I need them if
100:26 - they go off the left to come back on the
100:28 - other side as well or to randomize and
100:31 - go back from the top so so first of all
100:35 - I want to make this wind much smaller
100:36 - and I'm going to need different wind for
100:41 - each flake so I am now going to have the
100:47 - noise x offset is going to be the Z I
100:54 - want to say this is going to be down
100:57 - called Z offset this is kind of like
100:59 - crazy what I'm doing
101:02 - without like diagramming this or really
101:05 - explaining it I'm what I'm going to
101:07 - attempt to do is I'm going to have an X
101:09 - offset which is going to equal the snow
101:12 - the flakes exposition divided by the
101:20 - width of the window and the Y offset is
101:23 - going to be the snow's Y position
101:25 - divided by height and so I'm going to
101:28 - get the wind is going to be different
101:31 - depending on where you are
101:36 - with changings very very slowly over
101:39 - time and this should not be here any
101:42 - more
101:43 - this has to be here so now what we
101:47 - should get is there we go we have a nice
101:52 - flow field a distribution of wind so
101:55 - that was kind of like overly complicated
101:57 - well I think what I'm going to do is
101:59 - when they leave the screen I've just set
102:01 - them back up to the top so I think in
102:04 - the snowflake if they where do I where
102:10 - do I set them so I can say if this pause
102:15 - X so I kind of want this off-screen
102:18 - function because what I want to do is
102:23 - return this or this stop pause dot X is
102:29 - less than negative this dot R or this
102:35 - pause dot X is greater than negative
102:39 - that is greater than with plus this dot
102:44 - R so if any of these are true if any of
102:47 - these are true its off-screen and then
102:50 - here it's much simpler for me to just
102:52 - say if this dot off-screen randomize
102:59 - okay ah and I was making a good point or
103:04 - signs make a good point that I could
103:05 - start that I that I could keep I could
103:08 - constrain that angle so the wind really
103:10 - kind of so I think but let's let's take
103:19 - a look at this I think this is better
103:24 - not now can you really see that there's
103:26 - wind let's try to make that wind much
103:29 - bigger so what I want to do and I really
103:32 - should put this in the snowflake as a
103:34 - function I should really I should let
103:41 - them enter the opposite side okay that's
103:44 - a really good point
103:46 - because it's weird that they're not
103:48 - entering from the side so what I'll do
103:51 - that's actually a really good point let
103:53 - me change that oh that's so smart so I
103:56 - think I'm gonna go back to what it was
103:59 - before whoops
104:15 - what am I doing here there okay so if so
104:22 - I could still use the randomize I don't
104:26 - actually just have them wrap wrap around
104:28 - so this is their only randomize when
104:30 - they get to the bottom if this dot pause
104:32 - dot X is less than this dot R is less
104:39 - than just this dot R that negative this
104:41 - dot R the only thing is I can't really
104:46 - guarantee that they're gonna re-enter on
104:48 - the other side but let's try it let's
104:50 - say this dot pause x equals this dot
104:54 - with plus this dot R and let's just try
104:59 - if it is greater than width plus this
105:04 - dot R let's set that to negative let's
105:06 - just try this this is wrapping left and
105:10 - right let's see if this kind of has a
105:13 - nicer effect yeah I think this is better
105:18 - they're not gonna always enter they
105:21 - might get stuck kind of back and forth
105:24 - but if they enter okay with not this dot
105:32 - with thank you that was a mistake so
105:39 - this should help so hopefully that helps
105:41 - a little bit I kind of want to have more
105:43 - snow it feels like it's too few
105:45 - particles so I'm gonna go back to the
105:47 - sketch and see if I can get away with
105:49 - 400 okay now I want to see the wind be a
105:55 - little bit stronger just to have a sense
105:57 - that that's actually doing something and
105:59 - so I'm going to do that here I'm gonna
106:06 - make the wind ten times as strong just
106:09 - to sort of see yeah so if you can see
106:12 - that whoa there's a lot more swirling
106:14 - going on here so that's kind of
106:16 - interesting I mean finding the right
106:17 - balance there you can see how there's a
106:19 - flow field that they're following the
106:21 - gravity probably needs to be a lot
106:23 - stronger if I'm going to make that win
106:24 - that much stronger so let's go and make
106:27 - the graph
106:30 - also stronger so I don't know what's
106:35 - gonna cancel what out but you can see
106:36 - balancing those two forces of the wind
106:39 - and gravity on the sine wave I kind of
106:42 - want to see the sine wave also maybe be
106:44 - a little bit more prominent so where do
106:47 - I calculate that that X offset um let's
106:50 - let's just expand that by five just out
106:53 - of curiosity yeah so that's too much but
106:57 - let's expand it by two and maybe that
107:01 - angle is kind of Oh cuz it's tied to the
107:06 - spinning so I could actually also have
107:10 - it oscillate twice as fast so I don't
107:15 - know there's Pearlie noise wind there's
107:18 - oscillating sine waves I think maybe
107:20 - wind should change over time it is
107:22 - changing over time if I programmed it
107:24 - correctly the wind is changing over time
107:26 - because the Z offset is changing over
107:30 - time I could make that happen
107:31 - much faster I don't know how noticeable
107:34 - this will be so now there are so many
107:36 - parameters here so this I don't know
107:39 - that this was a coding challenge this
107:42 - was more just like I think this live
107:43 - stream might just stand alone as a live
107:45 - stream and all of its mess maybe I'll
107:47 - edit this not maybe I'll come back and
107:48 - redo this coding challenge but what I
107:52 - would like is to see people do creative
107:55 - variations on this so what are some
107:57 - things you could do number one is you
107:58 - could be more thoughtful about the
107:59 - design you could add other elements to
108:01 - the scene you can have the snow pile up
108:03 - you could generate algorithmic snowflake
108:07 - designs you could be more you could
108:09 - create a lot of sliders to control all
108:11 - the different possibilities here am i
108:14 - but this I could do a background I
108:16 - should do a background I could add some
108:18 - text make some of them translucent oh my
108:20 - god so many different possibilities so
108:22 - I'm gonna leave that maybe I'll come
108:24 - back and add some of those features but
108:25 - we're gonna save this and I am now going
108:29 - to go back I mean how could I go back to
108:36 - my fundraiser is anybody still watching
108:40 - this
108:40 - let's see so this started out I meant to
108:46 - take Brit this was practice next year
108:49 - I'm gonna do a much better telethon be
108:52 - much longer I'll have guests a plan for
108:55 - it but I do I do have some more songs to
108:57 - do I have to prepare I don't know if
108:59 - anyone sent me any songs
109:02 - let's go out a full screen
109:08 - let's close this alright let's take a
109:11 - look
109:11 - we were at 84 donors we're I think 72
109:15 - could anybody confirm the number of
109:17 - donors there was trained image in the
109:20 - background yes I'm gonna let everybody
109:21 - create their creative versions of this
109:23 - with different backgrounds
109:24 - I believe we started around 72 donors
109:25 - and around 2000 or so dollars we're now
109:29 - up to 91 donors 3000 and $20 for to the
109:34 - December 20 the December 2017 fundraiser
109:37 - for the processing foundation let me
109:39 - thank some more donors ah shoot I have
109:43 - to login it logged me out then I'm going
109:49 - to play so hold on donors so where did
109:55 - we last left job I think I thanked mark
109:58 - Leonard and now I'm going gone gone gone
110:00 - gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone
110:03 - gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone
110:05 - gone gone gone gone gone
112:42 - all right I think I am back okay
113:00 - 71 donors thank you okay sounds good
113:06 - okay is the hub popping and everything
113:09 - all gone now should I just start over
113:12 - popping is gone huh who knows what
113:18 - happened so who did I read all the
113:20 - donors or did I miss reading some of the
113:22 - donors well I'm glad that this problem
113:27 - seemed to have gone away I could just
113:30 - start the whole thing over now if I if I
113:33 - didn't I just I need an afternoon I've
113:34 - to I I got it
113:36 - I unfortunately I mean I haven't eaten
113:38 - any I'm gonna have to leave in the next
113:40 - like half an hour or so okay so I would
113:46 - like to thank the donors we started let
113:50 - me just mention again we started this
113:52 - fundraiser with 71 donors and we are now
113:58 - up to 93 we have hit the three thousand
114:01 - dollar mark is there any way we could
114:02 - hit the four thousand dollar mark by the
114:04 - end of this by the end by the end of
114:10 - this live stream I don't know let's see
114:12 - okay so but first let me thank all of
114:14 - the recent donors
114:18 - I want to thank mano el Thank You Manuel
114:24 - I want to thank greedy I want to thank
114:34 - donor from the Netherlands thank you a
114:37 - wonderful game in p5.js thank you for
114:39 - that I want to thank Simon Tiger Thank
114:47 - You Simon Simon amazing coding trained
114:51 - viewer writes I learned a program thanks
114:53 - to processing Thank You Simon
114:55 - and Sebastian Pacheco Thank You
115:01 - Sebastian for your donation okay and
115:10 - shoot this computer is dying I got
115:14 - these days I'll bring to power two
115:18 - powers to this room
115:19 - you should just bring the other one up
115:21 - for my cuz now this computer has stopped
115:23 - operating because it's like the
115:24 - battery's about to die I think and then
115:27 - here is another donor Thank You Sergey
115:30 - thank you for your donation you know
115:36 - what there's too much stuff open what
115:40 - it's this computer has frozen the
115:42 - computer that's showing me all of the
115:45 - donations has frozen what a mess
115:50 - there we go okay and thank you to Matt
115:55 - and thank you - thank you - anonymous
116:02 - donor thank you anonymous donor yeah
116:06 - thank you anonymous donor come back how
116:11 - do I get out of this oh let me refresh
116:17 - the page close some of this stuff it
116:23 - doesn't need to be open that would help
116:29 - alright
116:33 - I have killed the processing foundation
116:36 - admin panel now we're up to 96 thank you
116:40 - everybody for your donations to the
116:42 - processing foundation so I am going to
116:45 - thank everyone for their donations with
116:47 - a song I'm gonna get back to reading it
116:49 - this computer is being finicky with me I
116:51 - might just try to login in a different
116:52 - browser or something oh I see a whole
116:55 - bunch of new donations came in ah a
116:57 - whole bunch of new donations came in
116:59 - let's see thank you to Daniel O'Sullivan
117:02 - thank you to Greg King thank you to
117:07 - David Keck thank you to fret and thank
117:13 - you to anonymous donor and I think I got
117:19 - everybody now this is working for me
117:21 - again alright so what I'm going to do
117:24 - now I'm gonna take a short break to
117:25 - drink some water because as everybody
117:28 - knows the coding train is brought to you
117:30 - by delicious water I'm going to sing
117:42 - another holiday song for you the problem
117:45 - is I have there's gonna be a lot more
117:49 - difficult than my dreidel song so in the
117:53 - meantime I am going to play for you
117:57 - highlights from processing day so one
117:59 - thing I want to mention is that the
118:00 - processing foundation has a new YouTube
118:06 - channel right here I encourage you all
118:10 - to subscribe to the processing
118:12 - foundation's YouTube channel we recently
118:13 - had a processing day community event in
118:18 - came in Boston and all of the talks and
118:21 - presentations are here in this
118:24 - particular playlist so you can see
118:27 - Cassie Gottfried mature and Claire Jakub
118:30 - Sharon dela Cruz Andres roan and
118:32 - Guillermo Ava Diaz oh the coding train I
118:34 - did a live session there you can watch
118:36 - that Chris Coleman Rosa Weinberg Maxine
118:38 - Bama cor Brad Tober jose luis garcia del
118:40 - castillo Ahriman and chapman cha know
118:43 - Luisa Pereira and our Luke Dubois and
118:46 - Cristobal
118:47 - so I apologize to any of the processing
118:49 - fellows or lightning talks where I
118:51 - mispronounced your name I encourage you
118:53 - to watch all these talks I am going to I
118:54 - would like to show you some highlights
118:55 - from some of them and and so Matthew I
119:02 - put together some edited versions well
119:04 - that's why I meant to put my whole plan
119:05 - for today was to make the snow and that
119:09 - every so often take a break and show you
119:11 - one of these or just one or two minutes
119:12 - long but you can I definitely encourage
119:14 - you ever to watch all the videos let's
119:16 - watch Lauren's since I meant to also
119:18 - have Lauren skyping I just did a bad job
119:21 - of planning this and just too much to do
119:23 - but um let's try to watch Lauren's
119:25 - discussion of the origins of p5.js which
119:28 - I think would be useful and nice to see
119:30 - so I'm gonna play this for you while I
119:32 - take a short break to get my lyrics
119:34 - ready for the next song I guess they
119:42 - could download this file try one more
119:44 - time
119:46 - [Applause]
119:54 - and so the idea was that he and Dan and
119:56 - Ben invited me to do a processing
120:00 - fellowship and my charge was to imagine
120:04 - what processing might look like today or
120:06 - might look like for the web maybe and it
120:08 - was supposed to be just sort of like a
120:10 - three-month research project and so I
120:13 - thought okay cool this is my big chance
120:15 - like my big in I'm going I'm gonna do
120:17 - this I'm gonna be an open source like oh
120:19 - my gosh this is so awesome and so I said
120:21 - about and I did nothing nothing until I
120:25 - think one day Casey email means it's so
120:28 - about that fellowship but you gonna do
120:31 - anything and so I was like okay and he
120:35 - said well why don't you just you know it
120:37 - just try something just just try a
120:39 - little experiment you know that same
120:42 - idea to try something you don't need a
120:43 - whole plan and do my next week if you
120:46 - could so the deadline was also helpful
120:49 - at some point I felt really excited
120:51 - because I could also draw a circle and a
120:53 - rectangle just like you couldn't
120:55 - processing and figure it like I was like
120:56 - halfway there
121:00 - little did I know and so but while I was
121:04 - doing this this the question right was
121:06 - like what would process what might
121:07 - processing look like if it were kind of
121:09 - invented today and so the first ideas
121:11 - were well we would use html5 and
121:14 - JavaScript instead of Java but there was
121:17 - this other idea which was why not take
121:21 - you know diversity inclusivity as a core
121:24 - value what if we make this explicit
121:26 - rather than just something implicit
121:28 - maybe or hopeful and this idea that like
121:31 - no tools neutral tools are embedded with
121:33 - the beliefs the desires and the biases
121:35 - of its creators and we're talking about
121:37 - a tool for creative expression it
121:39 - becomes really critical that we have a
121:40 - lot of voices in the process of making
121:42 - that tool it can't just be a few
121:45 - developers that make all the decisions
121:47 - this is a little bit hard to read but
121:49 - this is Stephanie pie talking about we
121:51 - think maybe it's about hard work but
121:53 - what about mentorship and be Fiat before
121:55 - that even what about access
121:58 - Emily Chen went and talked with many of
122:01 - the women in the Python community and
122:04 - brought back some of her observations
122:05 - and this is one that we took really
122:07 - seriously
122:07 - just don't assume that anyone has to
122:09 - know anything
122:24 - Thank You Lauren I'm not finished
122:27 - rewriting the lyrics let's watch another
122:29 - one let's take a look at let's just go
122:34 - through these in order so let's those of
122:36 - you who might be Spanish language
122:38 - speakers this is a fellowship project
122:41 - this is what we use the funds that I'm
122:42 - asking people to donate forward to
122:43 - sponsor we have the fellowship call just
122:45 - ended we're gonna have new fellowships
122:47 - this you might be excited to learn about
122:49 - if for those of you who are Spanish
122:50 - speakers yeah cool so this talk is
122:58 - called beef IDs and espanol
123:00 - that stands for pitch ideas in Spanish
123:03 - my name is sarah moulton Moraga I'm
123:06 - Chilean we speech we speak Spanish there
123:08 - that's super south my work with proteins
123:11 - started when I applied for that pressing
123:13 - internship that they offered ITP and I
123:15 - said hey I love this but my friends in
123:18 - Chile they don't know about it and most
123:20 - people don't know about it I just know
123:21 - like the very tiny community of Minyard
123:23 - stir so I said is it cool if I can
123:26 - translate like the reference of the
123:27 - website so there is like seeing this was
123:30 - for me super gratifying like seeing like
123:32 - this welcoming thing that is in Spanish
123:34 - and as a part of that I we we we founded
123:40 - this with some friends this called coded
123:41 - and it's an Essene code and education
123:43 - which are also the same or since planet
123:45 - and it's a squirrel a dirty Cioffi
123:47 - electron egos coded started a year ago
123:51 - we co-founded this school in April so
123:56 - it's it's brand new but it started last
124:00 - year when I came to New York and I
124:01 - didn't know about processing or p5 he
124:04 - told me right there's that frameworks to
124:07 - to make art and I wanted to meet
124:10 - electronical engineers or coding with
124:13 - arts or music well so we flew out that
124:18 - in Chile and in South America coding is
124:20 - not taught us it's out adhering in
124:23 - United States or in Europe so we wanted
124:26 - to make something to to fix it and we
124:29 - started to we say well let's start to
124:31 - teach p5 so we started to make
124:36 - curses and resources for that and the
124:40 - first curse we made these must be five
124:41 - days in espanol so it was the first
124:44 - curse with with high school guys they
124:47 - were they started four guys and finally
124:49 - they were two graduated it was in a
124:51 - public library in Chile and thanks so
124:54 - much for everything that pressing that

126:48 - I love just making new things on p5.js
126:53 - okay I'm just reading the names that are
126:55 - that people put in this that want to
126:57 - have publicly listed on the membership
126:59 - page okay so now where do I go next back
127:01 - to the slack chat back to the live
127:04 - channel all right yes so I I'm getting
127:12 - some good suggestions now this is gonna
127:14 - be quite a shock to all of you so the
127:17 - problem was I I got this via pretty this
127:20 - music out this morning and then I read
127:21 - was rewriting the lyrics on it and I got
127:23 - them all off because I didn't realize I
127:25 - printed out on double-sided pages so I
127:27 - don't have my page turner here with me
127:29 - but I'm gonna attempt to play this song
127:33 - for you this song goes out by the way
127:37 - everybody I half of you or at least are
127:40 - like three-quarters or 90% of you are
127:41 - gonna hate this
127:42 - you just wanted to come watch do some
127:44 - coding tutorials you go do something
127:45 - else maybe a small percentage you are
127:48 - gonna enjoy this insanity of mine
127:49 - because I'm just trying to figure out
127:51 - what are ways that I could embarrass
127:52 - myself even more and so I did a song
127:56 - earlier and this is going to be my
127:57 - second song mm-hm
128:00 - this is my back away this is my keyboard
128:02 - so edit running if they're able to in
128:05 - live and I have like a church organ
128:07 - sound so I don't know even know I
128:09 - haven't practiced this at all by the way
128:12 - [Music]
128:16 - all right I just needs to be up in
128:18 - octave that's probably blowing out all
128:21 - your ears
128:35 - this dark for Christmas there is just
128:40 - one
128:43 - about the syntax or the light wasted
128:49 - memory too loud okay everybody hold on -
128:55 - loud - oh is this better
129:10 - better better better better I'll start
129:14 - over
129:14 - let me get a little softer okay much
129:23 - better okay we're gonna start this over
129:25 - because somebody might want to cut this
129:27 - out as its own thing how do I get reverb
129:32 - here anybody know Ableton Live I feel
129:37 - like this is a bad this is a bad
129:39 - instrument for this song
129:41 - oops um in the wrong mouse let's see I
129:44 - need a different instrument I think that
129:56 - could work
129:58 - [Music]
130:01 - synth keys and flea voices many violin
130:07 - like a string strings I should just do a
130:14 - regular piano accordion what could be
130:35 - what could what could be wrong with
130:36 - accordion I have no idea what I'm doing
130:42 - did I pronounce marriage in marriage in
130:45 - Marc Maron merit I totally pronounced it
130:47 - wrong em in the chat type grand piano
130:54 - how do I find grand piano piano and keys
130:58 - you would think that would be under here
130:59 - right search okay
131:02 - grand piano all right let's try that
131:11 - Marin Marin alright now we have an
131:18 - actual piano
131:18 - [Music]
131:24 - all right oh and of course what am I
131:28 - thinking we have to have now how do I
131:38 - get reverb or anything on this or who
131:41 - knows how's the volume okay here we go
131:53 - wait I have my music
132:05 - mooo mud mud Miren Miren Marin Marin I
132:11 - think I'm getting better sorry I'm gonna
132:13 - practice that later
132:20 - [Music]
132:23 - hey hit the wrong note that sounds a
132:26 - little quiet is it a little quiet now no
132:34 - I'm gonna put it down an octave as soon
132:36 - as I get past this but what's the
132:37 - equivalent of hitting the floor pedal
132:39 - with this keyboard I guess oh now we're
132:50 - gonna telling me they can't hear the
132:51 - piano here we go octave down I don't
133:12 - want I don't want this stop for
133:15 - Christmas there is just one thing I need
133:19 - I don't care about the syntax
133:24 - all the wasted memory I just want you
133:33 - for my own more than whoops don't do the
133:39 - reflex okay
133:42 - I just want my sketch to play more than
133:48 - you could ever say let's try Java mode
133:56 - oh all I want for Christmas Christmas is
134:13 - [Music]
134:27 - [Music]
134:34 - [Music]
134:47 - there is just one I'm just gonna keep on
134:55 - I won't make a linked list and send it
135:11 - without the use of when Zach gets
135:17 - [Music]
135:21 - maybe it'll work with oh I want for
135:38 - Christmas
135:40 - [Music]
135:54 - see all right I think I could have used
136:12 - a little more rehearsal and but I didn't
136:17 - really work very hard on this and now
136:21 - there is another song that was sent to
136:25 - me by me I am so me the house take
136:29 - number one you want me to do it again
136:32 - all right so by the way the chat is
136:36 - seemed that encouraged me to do bored of
136:38 - this don't encourage me cuz I'll be back
136:41 - this is all holiday thing there's New
136:43 - Year's songs there's pop music you know
136:46 - send me I'm just the problems of my
136:48 - writing skills are very poor my all my
136:49 - skills are bad poor I I really can
136:52 - barely play the piano like definitely
136:54 - cannot sing at all and my writing that's
136:57 - so clever with the writing and the
136:58 - lyrics I I did my best there but I think
137:00 - other people are more clever or maybe
137:01 - people want to record their own okay oh
137:07 - can you change the background of the
137:10 - snow sketch to green so we can edit this
137:12 - hmm hmm dare I do this again okay it
137:21 - could be as a rehearsal there okay green
137:23 - only up so I can what I need to add is
137:28 - color source and create a new color
137:33 - source and I want it to just be green
137:44 - okay and like this is this what you want
137:53 - is this what you want is this what
137:55 - everybody wants
137:56 - oh just with this snow with this snow
137:59 - but I was worried about the compression
138:01 - right right I was worried about the
138:04 - problem is although I guess the recorded
138:07 - version all right pre keyed footage okay
138:17 - she like shut are we good I'm looking at
138:19 - the patron group and the slack you want
138:21 - the snow or is this good give me some
138:22 - thumbs up or some thumbs down I'm gonna
138:24 - get my I didn't think I was ever gonna
138:26 - have to use this music again do I have
138:32 - it all hmm one two what I don't like

139:59 - you think that this makes me look more
140:01 - like that I should have the headphones

141:26 - want this dot for Christmas there is
141:29 - just one thing I need I don't care about
141:34 - the syntax all the wasted memory I just

142:54 - won't make a linked list and send it
142:59 - without the use of WebSockets
143:03 - I won't even stay awake to try debugging
143:09 - try debugging with the IDE
143:13 - I just want my code to sing more than
143:25 - you want machine learning maybe it'll
143:33 - work
143:37 - oh I want Forks oh I want for Christmas
143:50 - is cold
143:59 - [Music]

146:41 - actually enable it it's funny how I have
146:43 - no idea how to use Ableton I'm just like
146:46 - making stuff up that's still the piano
146:52 - [Music]
146:55 - how do I change that oh I say it can
146:59 - change it look at this reverb
147:04 - [Music]
147:12 - how did I get the organ back it's very
147:18 - loud right why I should really like
147:29 - learn how to do this stuff before okay
147:35 - hold on I have an idea
147:38 - don't save let's just start over
147:45 - uh-oh I lost oh wait I have an idea
147:49 - oh uh hold on everyone
148:10 - watch your head earphones everybody yeah
148:23 - she's just the web via the API to
148:25 - control is that too loud
148:29 - I took the headphones off all right I
148:48 - found a little issue and filed it on
148:55 - github and when its debug completely
149:01 - then poor request I will love Oh issue
149:05 - issue issue I filed it on get a website
149:12 - titled it on get and when it's debug
149:18 - completely then pull request I will
149:27 - [Music]
149:33 - don't hold long notes I don't know okay
149:39 - I think I hurt my neck there so these
149:41 - are the two songs I had prepared but I
149:43 - am looking bright one more song that was
149:46 - very excited to try suggested by me I am
149:50 - so Mimi I am Samia are you watching this
149:51 - right now I don't think you are
149:55 - can somebody me I am so me can somebody
149:58 - DM me or repost the song that me I am so
150:02 - me suggested I think I should go back to
150:07 - the piano
150:12 - Oh coding train coat yeah I know the
150:19 - jingle bells' like I've gotten that that
150:22 - suggestion it's funny like I did at one
150:27 - point know how to change to a different
150:30 - instrument but I don't seem to anymore I
150:41 - can show you guys anybody know how to
150:45 - use Ableton how do I change this I was
150:49 - just sort of like dragging it in here
150:51 - and it kind of like suddenly enabled
150:53 - itself yeah I could put stowed in the
150:59 - background
151:00 - yeah the way I'm I gave it away yes
151:03 - those lyrics Alka but first I had to
151:05 - figure out how to get the piano back
151:06 - although I guess the church organ kind
151:07 - of works for this by two instruments
151:17 - yeah how do I must be a thing that I
151:23 - like select something I'm just clicking
151:25 - on like random stuff
151:27 - [Music]
151:31 - okay okay okay all right
151:37 - so now I'm gonna have the lyrics over
151:39 - here let's see if I can find the chords
151:49 - to this song I should really ask for
151:51 - some more time coding all the way up
151:54 - funds coding challenge live that's
151:55 - pretty good okay okay let's see if
152:08 - Ultimate Guitar calm wait wait oh I'm on
152:22 - dirty Saul you need to grab and drop the
152:25 - piano on the right column drag and drop
152:27 - the piano on the right column okay let
152:29 - me try to get this yeah this is where I
152:34 - am right thank you got it thank you oh I
152:50 - see this this might work I see how I can
152:59 - select instrument now thank you
153:01 - everybody
153:01 - oh this is very hard if the lyrics over
153:10 - here in the music here which is just the
153:12 - chords but oh it's quite loud again ok
153:16 - quite loud again
153:24 - yeah I should put the snow back in the
153:27 - background better okay okay Oh
153:45 - Oh last wait hmm I think I might need
153:58 - the extra actual sheet music because I
154:06 - don't know even though the tunes
154:16 - let's see
154:43 - [Music]
154:58 - this is not this is this is not gonna
155:01 - work for me okay this I shoot this is a
155:04 - bad idea to like just try to find music
155:06 - a statement
155:13 - I gave you my pointer but the very next
155:16 - line I think I need to go back to the
155:19 - piano I can't hear the music is too
155:23 - crazy I don't know okay all right let's
155:39 - try to find
155:54 - here we go okay okay I've got it now
156:05 - [Music]
156:17 - I gave you my pointer but the very next
156:25 - line you gave it away this time
156:42 - there's pull this time there's plenty of
156:49 - fears Oh give it to some last last
157:22 - statement I gave you my pointer but very
157:27 - next time you gave it away so you get a
157:35 - bite here okay that was good enough
157:38 - that's about as much as I mean again
157:40 - [Music]
157:53 - alright there was one other suggestion
157:55 - that came in
158:06 - Oh
158:27 - all right let's go back to the snow oh
158:29 - no I can't go back the problem I can't
158:30 - go back to the snow cuz they'll have the
158:32 - music on the computer okay now I should
158:39 - I should mention by the way that the
158:42 - reason why I'm doing this partially
158:43 - other than just being completely insane
158:45 - is that I'm doing this as a fund raiser
158:47 - for the processing foundation we are now
158:48 - up to 101 donors I mean it started at 71
158:51 - so they've been 30 people have donated
158:53 - since I started this livestream and
158:55 - we're up to three thousand dollars let's
158:57 - take a look
158:59 - 105 donors I will do jingle bells for
159:02 - the new donors thank you very much and I
159:07 - should get a snow background but okay
159:10 - and I can always do that okay
159:14 - [Music]
159:22 - declare declare oh this is so high Clary
159:26 - [Music]
159:27 - global variables above the function set
159:34 - up throwing the array with bubbles and
159:41 - then going and doing draw and looping
159:44 - and then drawing all that using a for of
159:45 - loop or maybe a for each loop and
159:47 - drawing all the bubbles coding coding
159:57 - coding train coding train coding
160:01 - iteration oh what fun is to type a
160:10 -  simulation hey coding tree
160:15 - coding train coding train coding p5.js
160:21 - it's not the right Court that's just the
160:24 - same court OD'ing train is my music is
160:26 - wrong this internet is very unreliable
160:30 - oh it is to type and see 60fps
160:44 - Hey
160:46 - [Music]
160:49 - so here's the thing I really need to
160:51 - transpose that down for my baritone
160:53 - voice it was too high for me
160:55 - OD so I guess I could transpose it but
160:59 - if it's that was gee if I go down by a
161:01 - fifth dashing through this dashing
161:06 - one horse open dashing through the snow
161:09 - Cyrene global variables
161:13 - [Music]
161:15 - buh-buh-buh-buh-buh very balls above the
161:18 - function Senna filling the array with
161:22 - bubbles and then going to draw on doing
161:26 - it iterator through all the bubbles so
161:27 - that they could see and maybe turning
161:29 - into a snow simulation code coding
161:41 - coding train coding train coding
161:44 - iteration what's covered in train coding
161:48 - train coding iteration no company cuz
161:52 - this musics wrong again big trains
161:53 - coasting straight coding iteration oh
161:57 - what fun is to type it is to type a
162:09 - flocking simulation hey coding train
162:14 - coding train code inky coding coding
162:19 - train coding it's wrong Cody Cody Cody
162:25 - Cody p5.js Cody b5 j s oh what fun
162:37 - oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse
162:48 - sixty of 60 frame FPS open
162:56 - hey curly bracket parentheses semi-colon
163:02 - [Music]
163:11 - how many I'll we just want to see I'm
163:13 - really like can i really drive everybody
163:15 - away well I don't have my live dashboard
163:18 - up anymore
163:19 - alright oh boy I'm getting emails
163:23 - nobody's telling me to quit the Internet
163:26 - alright so I had to like look at the
163:29 - lyrics look at the music which was
163:30 - incorrect trying to transpose it in my
163:32 - head this really not I need to to
163:34 - practice and plan for these better
163:35 - meanwhile we did do this nice coding
163:41 - challenge
163:42 - there's our snow we did this as a coding
163:44 - challenge let's take a look I think I'm
163:47 - gonna go now it's 2 o'clock I know there
163:50 - was a lot of technical difficulties and
163:55 - there's gotta be a good like Oh
163:57 - Tenenbaum one you know Chanukah okay
164:11 - this is good though this is gonna be
164:13 - useful in the future wait hold on okay
164:16 - so oh look this is what it was at the
164:20 - beginning this is a page that I didn't
164:21 - refresh so we're at 71 donors when we
164:24 - started this live stream we do have a 25
164:26 - dollar goal which I recognize especially
164:27 - when you leave the next 5 or 10 minutes
164:29 - are probably not gonna hit we are now up
164:33 - to 107 donors three thousand five
164:35 - hundred fifty dollars for the processer
164:36 - foundation that will fund one full
164:38 - fellowship so three fellowship stipend
164:41 - is three thousand dollars and mentor
164:46 - stipend although sometimes the mentors
164:47 - do volunteer is five hundred dollars for
164:49 - someone to mentor okay so I am going to
164:52 - tell you more about what this funds by
164:55 - showing you another fellowship this is
164:58 - Sharon dela Cruz this is a short two
165:03 - minute video
165:08 - my name is Sharron lagoons I'm an artist
165:12 - and I do a whole bunch of things and I
165:14 - think Lauren said it nicely I'd go into
165:17 - spaces and I fill it a little bit but
165:21 - what I'm gonna focus on now is or today
165:24 - for this presentation is how I'm filling
165:26 - this space at Princeton University so
165:28 - I'm currently the director of the studio
165:30 - lab which is a creative tech lab at
165:32 - Princeton and so this summer I read this
165:35 - wonderful book called Mindstorms which
165:38 - you should read if you haven't you might
165:40 - see more Peppard and i just really love
165:42 - this quote which talks to true computer
165:46 - literacy is not just knowing how to make
165:48 - use of computers and computational ideas
165:49 - it's knowing when it's appropriate to do
165:51 - so and I think that idea funnels into
165:54 - the pedagogy of the space in the studio
165:57 - lab and what I hope to do and and when
166:01 - you understand that technology can mean
166:05 - a lot of things like a sewing machine or
166:07 - paint things get really exciting so then
166:11 - you can paint on a circuit and teach
166:13 - folks about resistance without ever
166:15 - holding a resistor and it's been really
166:18 - fun to look at stem accessibility
166:21 - especially particularly I'm interested
166:23 - in tech deserts and how do you bring
166:25 - that how do you bring STEM education to
166:27 - tech deserts which include jails which
166:29 - include marginalized communities which
166:31 - include folks who unfortunately been
166:34 - funneled code as a means of a job
166:36 - instead of expression
166:38 - I'm usually that's what I look like most
166:40 - of the time I don't know why I'm here
166:42 - who's here what am i doing all of the
166:44 - time but that's what I run with and
166:47 - that's what I love to do and so that's
166:49 - what I bring to Princeton University
166:50 - thank you
166:53 - [Applause]
166:54 - Thank You Sharon so you can watch the
166:59 - full the full all of the videos from
167:05 - processing day or most of these talks
167:08 - are about 10 minutes long these are just
167:09 - short one to two-minute versions of them
167:11 - and you can watch all of them here on
167:15 - the new processing YouTube channel okay
167:18 - let me thank some more donors I feel
167:21 - like I should have like a phone that I
167:23 - can answer calls with okay so there is
167:31 - all right there are some more donors
167:33 - that have come in here just during this
167:35 - live stream where did I last leave off I
167:38 - don't think I think I read this one okay
167:41 - so thank you too Radovan Dras Kovac for
167:44 - your donation thank you too oh wait I
167:52 - already read these but I'm gonna say it
167:53 - again
167:54 - Marian Miren Miren Maron for your
167:57 - donation from the Netherlands I think I
168:00 - read some of these already thank you to
168:02 - James burns for your donation I don't
168:05 - know why I'm forgetting to do the Bell
168:06 - here's another donation and thank you
168:08 - too
168:10 - - these yollie's these alley thank you
168:14 - thank you
168:15 - close enough thank you Maron and here we
168:21 - go we've got another one from
168:22 - Christopher Coleman and Layla Marin
168:24 - thank you so much for your studio
168:26 - membership so thank you so much and now
168:30 - we have one more Thomas Blackburn thank
168:33 - you for your donation and we are now up
168:35 - to that's where we are 107 donors $3,550
168:42 - we are funding in December all donations
168:44 - for December a full fellowship the
168:47 - fellowships will be announced probably
168:48 - in 2018 that's the next year the the
168:53 - open call for the fellowships has closed
168:55 - but you can always apply next year
168:57 - assuming the processing foundation still
168:59 - like this which I hope and think that it
169:01 - will all right so what else what else
169:05 - can we do today
169:08 - oh what a joy don't look at my music oh
169:11 - there's snow so I should probably go
169:18 - it's after 2:00 I've been here now for
169:20 - like three hours I had a lot of a lot of
169:24 - technical difficulties we did make this
169:26 - beautiful wintry snow I do feel like the
169:29 - actual programming of it was kind of
169:31 - convoluted and I don't know that it can
169:33 - actually be edited into a challenge but
169:34 - that's fine this will just stand alone
169:36 - as a special live episode usually most
169:39 - of my sessions get edited into smaller
169:41 - tutorial videos today I'm just goofing
169:42 - around so let me see if I can get any
169:45 - more requests close the Downloads bar at
169:51 - the bottom thank you so what could we
169:55 - try could we try which should I try one
169:57 - or two more things for the snow yeah I
170:00 - don't think I'm gonna post the code for
170:01 - this do we do it anybody have any song
170:05 - lyrics they want me to try what else I
170:08 - would like to play more of these
170:09 - processing Day videos for you but I
170:11 - guess people are saying that they'd
170:13 - rather just wash them on their own time
170:15 - which is totally understandable and
170:18 - let's see do a background to the snow
170:23 - but with the background be let's see i
170:29 - as a lot of those donations are
170:30 - complicated so every time a new donation
170:32 - comes in I'm gonna stay here for 10
170:35 - extra minutes so let's see we're gonna
170:40 - put a timer on now I got to get the
170:42 - power here
170:51 - okay so let's see here we're gonna do a
170:53 - timer let's first see still at 107
170:57 - donors 10 minutes timer just it keeps
171:09 - going if I go to another tab right so
171:12 - it's at 9 minutes and 50 seconds now
171:18 - 10900 yeah okay me I am so he is
171:22 - pointing out that people could do $1
171:24 - dieticians so I'm gonna stay for an
171:27 - extra 10 1 minute per 10 dollars in
171:31 - donations how about that no no yes good
171:36 - point let's see it's okay because
171:40 - nobody's actually donated yet so so now
171:43 - I can scratch that for if um I'll just
171:51 - stay up let's see what's a nice formula
171:55 - $10 for one minute so $100 is 10 minutes
172:00 - we're at 3/5 but I'm going to go for 10
172:02 - minutes right now and we'll see we'll
172:04 - see what I just tear off the tab make
172:10 - this fullscreen open up I can make this
172:14 - like a tiny little window if I ever
172:18 - could use a computer by the way I used
172:20 - to do this in my coding challenges
172:21 - remember when I had those ah no I want
172:23 - not fullscreen I just want full browser
172:26 - so annoying
172:37 - there we go that'll do it okay
172:40 - I will check the donations I'm gonna be
172:43 - here for eight more minutes I will I
172:50 - will happily take song requests
172:53 - I do need fun I will take song requests
172:55 - I will happily do my performance of all
173:01 - I want for Christmas is code again I can
173:07 - also try to add things to this snowflake
173:09 - simulation I'm just looking for requests
173:11 - now but I'll also answer questions in
173:16 - the chat background to the snow so what
173:20 - would be a good background for the snow
173:34 - please sing one more time reindeer
173:38 - better background well I need help with
173:41 - the background idea better background I
173:43 - agree Purple Rain Purple Rain yep that
173:54 - sounds that's that's gonna be too hard
173:55 - I'll do that later another time gradient
173:59 - sky-blue
174:00 - quaint village gradient blue sky
174:06 - gradient blue sky kind of like that
174:08 - number we're at three five five zero
174:10 - okay gradient blue sky oh thank you I'm
174:20 - once again I'm getting some background

181:42 - which means though I closed that window
181:46 - I will stay here for another two minutes
181:54 - and forty seconds let's just round it up
181:59 - to three all right I'm here to answer
182:15 - your creative coding questions or try
182:21 - more singing or possibly make a change
182:23 - to the snow simulation I really just
182:24 - plain exhausted I can't do any more
182:26 - coding so I don't know if this is really
182:28 - there's much point here I would be happy
182:30 - to to play another processing day video
182:35 - what else can I do
182:40 - mmm okay I'm getting some song lyrics
182:46 - suggested from the chat we'll try this
182:49 - one now
183:01 - I'm gonna try this now
183:10 - okay this lyrics were submitted by David
183:15 - okay correct syntactically round well
183:46 - I'm doing this in this is a very weird
183:48 - key for me compiler all this bug free
184:12 - [Music]
184:14 - round function subclass and superclass
184:29 - yeah yes okay good we got we got 30
184:36 - seconds left
184:36 - come on I got I'm like JavaScript or
184:44 - Java Script come code it 300 different
184:47 - kind of ways and the name of the week
184:52 - put your desktop image but the one
184:55 - without snow okay I'm getting lots of
184:58 - requests I saw my PC oh my god
185:07 - [Music]
185:13 - okay let's stop this timer and we are
185:18 - now going to go back three five seven
185:26 - six we were at three five seven six
185:28 - let's see what we get two
185:43 - thank you everyone good night
185:45 - thank you everyone good night thank you
185:47 - thank you it's been nice being here with
185:50 - you
185:52 - did I I've been nice being here with
185:54 - everybody today on this special coding
185:55 - train and I hope to see you all on the
186:07 - next coding train which will be in 2018
186:09 - and then
186:13 - [Music]
186:17 - coding trainer say goodnight you know
186:23 - it's just the afternoon coding trade had
186:28 - many technical hiccups but and it will
186:31 - be back and all the streaming will work
186:35 - bye-bye coding train train you all have
186:42 - Mary get miss as I'm being told to say
186:45 - in the chat
186:46 - thank you everybody it's about 2:30 I'm
186:48 - gonna go do the rest of my day thank you
186:50 - for everyone for making a donation I
186:51 - can't remember if I read the names of
186:53 - the they don't recall if I read the
186:58 - donations of the last donations there is
187:03 - one here from anonymous donation for one
187:07 - dollar thank you and another anonymous
187:09 - donation for $25 thank you very much
187:11 - that's where we got those $26 I'm gonna
187:13 - go I'll be back in 2018 I will probably
187:18 - be take the coding stuff a little more
187:21 - seriously I'm planning to do a bunch of
187:23 - tutorials around machine learning it's a
187:25 - little bit sad that I didn't get to all
187:28 - these coding challenges that I hope to
187:30 - get to but I did make this snow and so
187:33 - what I would love we could have a
187:34 - hashtag I'm kind of a hashtag for people
187:39 - to share their snow creations little
187:42 - gifts on Twitter or make a little code
187:43 - pens send them to me at Schiffman I will
187:46 - post the code and all that sort of stuff
187:50 - I will be back sometime after the
187:55 - January 2nd probably the end of that
187:57 - week what day is that something like
188:00 - that all right
188:02 - oh my goodness terrible hat hair III I
188:09 - cannot bear to say goodbye oh I really
188:10 - want to make a 3d version of this I
188:12 - wanted to do it in 3d with planes
188:17 - somebody wants to make somebody wants to
188:20 - just make a quick donation if we could
188:25 - get 25 more dollars
188:28 - I like see if I could just get to this
188:31 - work with WebGL just 25 more dollars to
188:34 - the processing foundation let's see this
188:37 - 110 111 112 let's see if we can make
188:45 - that happen for Olli another donation of
188:51 - $25 to the processing foundation I will
188:56 - attempt to turn this snow into a WebGL
189:01 - system alright let's see if it happens
189:35 - [Music]
189:45 - up-up-up
189:47 - oh my goodness we're way up there okay
190:01 - we did it okay okay let's see if we can
190:07 - do it just a little bit just a little
190:10 - bit that works right that's good for
190:32 - getting a donation okay let's close this
190:34 - so we're gonna go to our code and we're
190:38 - gonna change this to web GL hold on hold
190:45 - on hold on everybody let's make a copy
190:49 - we're gonna have a 3d version desktop
190:53 - snow snow 3d snow 3d and then I'm gonna
191:08 - close this go to terminal it should have
191:12 - left while I had the chance I had had to
191:16 - get one more 20 what am i doing
191:23 - desktop snow my stomach is growling
191:27 - let's run a server here well let's first
191:31 - open it up and Adam and then let's run a
191:36 - server and we should see the same exact
191:40 - thing
191:41 - excellent and Adam I should be in snow
191:44 - 3d great okay by the way I don't even
191:50 - celebrate the holiday associated with
191:52 - this hat just because you're wondering
191:54 - what I'm just I've got the spirit I
191:57 - don't know I have a YouTube channel
191:58 - don't I do the holidays okay so I am now
192:05 - going to just first change this to WebGL
192:09 - just out of curiosity let's just change
192:11 - this to WebGL and see what breaks right
192:15 - why not a lot of stuff broke well here's
192:20 - the thing I don't can't use the image
192:22 - function anymore now the image function
192:23 - probably should be done in such a way
192:26 - that if you call it in WebGL it behind
192:28 - the scenes makes a textured plain but
192:30 - we'll do that ourselves manually so
192:32 - let's go to here and let's say I believe
192:38 - what I want to do is get rid of this get
192:42 - rid of this and I want to say texture
192:46 - this dot image and plane this dot R this
192:50 - dot R let's try that see what happens
192:56 - let's set up where am I looking at the
193:01 - right code let me just make sure I'm
193:06 - like running the correct code oh no I
193:10 - forgot that I had this silly thing here
193:12 - that I'm not doing anymore okay
193:16 - okay oh oh it doesn't like these as
193:21 - textures why what's wrong with the 32 by
193:25 - 32 image texture mm oh boy oh boy are we
193:44 - gonna be ah
193:45 - is are we running into a problem where
193:49 - this actual a 32 by 32 okay I'm gonna
193:53 - have to do a test here we're going
193:55 - have to do we'd have to comment
193:56 - everything out and do some tests it's
194:06 - common to everything I do want to store
194:07 - all these images so one thing I want to
194:09 - do is let's just do texture sprite sheet
194:18 - plane with comma height let's see what
194:22 - happens here okay so this works as a
194:27 - texture that image worked as a texture
194:30 - what if I were to say textures index is
194:34 - zero Oh interesting
194:38 - okay so I'm doing something wrong
194:39 - somewhere else what if I were to say
194:42 - playing 32 but though I think I know
194:44 - what the problem is I think I know what
194:46 - the problem is thirty-two point one
194:48 - thirty two point seven no I was I was
194:53 - sort of thinking that maybe maybe it's
194:55 - maybe some of them are so small hmm what
195:00 - if it's like less than one huh all this
195:06 - is working so what do we think that I
195:08 - did as an error right
195:21 - let's go back and put this in up I'm
195:31 - being asked what I'm being asked oh the
195:38 - errors complaining about the Translate
195:40 - interesting let's let me look at the air
195:44 - again I didn't look at it very carefully
195:50 - cannot read so where did this happen
195:53 - snowflake render snowflake J ass line 95
195:58 - so let me just try something here let me
196:03 - just force the size no that worked what
196:11 - let me just force wonderful oh I know
196:15 - what the problem is
196:20 - rotate doesn't work in peace in in the
196:23 - WebGL render is pacifically say rotate Z
196:26 - wonder if that was actually the problem
196:29 - yeah that was the problem
196:31 - nice ok so now you can go back to this
196:37 - dot R this dot R
196:46 - now this is working but something has
196:48 - gone wrong right because everything is
196:50 - offset so it's untended to like rethink
196:54 - everything but I'm actually just gonna
196:55 - do something rather lazy which is just
196:57 - oh but I really want that everything to
197:00 - be centered around the center if I'm
197:03 - gonna do some camera movement so let's
197:05 - let's rethink at all so when we create
197:08 - these I'm gonna make a random location
197:12 - right centered around the center no
197:18 - actually no it's not between it's
197:21 - between negative width / 2 + width / -
197:25 - that's a random location around the
197:28 - center I should really just make a
197:29 - global variable that's like half width
197:31 - or something and then this is where we
197:35 - set locations we also God we do it in
197:39 - too many places - height / - I really
197:45 - really should make a global variable
197:47 - that's half width half height but I'm
197:50 - too stubborn and so this should at least
197:55 - fix their starting locations sort of I
197:59 - must have made a mistake somewhere extra
198:01 - comment on line 2028 in sketch KS yep
198:06 - thank you still didn't fix it wait
198:12 - negative with okay so that's thanks well
198:16 - maybe the randomize is happening ah I
198:18 - know what a big problem is now in
198:21 - snowflake
198:23 - everything has to check if it is less
198:28 - greater than height / - less than
198:35 - negative width / 2 - the star greater
198:40 - than width / 2 + the star and randomize
198:43 - where's randomize all right fix that
198:46 - already okay great yeah shoot I don't
198:50 - know if I'm using this anymore but I'm
198:51 - gonna have to fix it
198:55 - and this should be - height / - - height
198:59 - / to redo the whole coordinate system
199:06 - yeah okay this is now the snowflakes in
199:11 - 3d and if you don't believe me watch
199:14 - this I'm gonna do something insane I'm
199:20 - going to say right here at the beginning
199:22 - right after draw I don't need this
199:27 - anymore
199:28 - rotate let's rotate X but I'm going to
199:31 - show you something cool that I've
199:32 - learned rotate X which no let's rotate Y
199:41 - rotate Y by Z off
199:51 - okay now look at this so it's this flat
199:55 - plane of snowflakes oh guess what I
199:57 - don't have to do the parallax thing
199:58 - anymore I don't have to do the parallax
200:02 - thing anymore
200:03 - that's the whole point of doing this in
200:04 - 3d okay so let's boy this is gonna make
200:10 - things really nice and simple random
200:14 - sighs we don't need random size anymore
200:18 - we don't need all that I'm just gonna
200:23 - make them 32 pixels all of them I don't
200:28 - need to multiply I don't need to do this
200:30 - parallax thing anymore
200:32 - let's just see what did I miss
200:36 - f is not defined whoops so let's go back
200:39 - to I kind of like the idea of copying
200:42 - the force vector just in case okay
200:45 - whoops get random size is not defined
200:51 - probably in randomized I can just say I
200:58 - don't need to randomize the size anymore
201:03 - okay there we go
201:05 - right there's all of my snow in 2d it's
201:10 - doing something particularly weird
201:11 - though hold on let's well I'm because I
201:16 - use that this dot are in so many
201:18 - different places let's turn off this
201:19 - rotation oh just the sine wave is now
201:26 - the same for all of them which is not
201:28 - good it shouldn't be though because
201:35 - angle is random let's let's find that
201:37 - offset let me get rid of that offset for
201:40 - a second where do I set the offset I'm
201:49 - just going to get rid of that offset for
201:50 - a second okay now they're all moving at
201:55 - exactly the same speed which is fine
201:58 - they're also reappearing in the wrong
202:01 - place
202:03 - top
202:04 - update no no that you're just behind me
202:07 - okay hold on hold on I want to add the Z
202:15 - but I want this to look as expected
202:24 - oh no that's right
202:34 - I mean I realize they're all going at
202:35 - the same speed now oh and there's just
202:39 - like it is doing it there's just a weird
202:41 - little break here because of how they're
202:43 - all going at the same but why are they
202:44 - appearing on the screen I didn't fix the
202:48 - wrapping I thought I did oh oh I didn't
202:53 - fix this so this I didn't fix this
203:00 - wrapping okay this you great there's a
203:06 - weird little break because of how
203:09 - they're all falling at the same speed
203:10 - but I think once I add to Z that's going
203:12 - to go away so let's put this let's add
203:15 - to Z now so what I'm going to do is I'm
203:19 - going to let Z equal some random amount
203:23 - let's try between negative 100 and 100
203:26 - I'm going to create the vector at Z and
203:30 - in randomize I'm gonna do the same exact
203:34 - thing again I should reuse this
203:35 - randomize function in the constructor
203:37 - it's really awful everything that I'm
203:39 - doing here and let's just see what
203:42 - happens
203:50 - maybe okay let's add the so hold on let
203:57 - me rotate Y by map Mouse X 0 with 0 & 2
204:03 - pi
204:04 - just I just want to be able to look at
204:07 - the scene here and see oh I'm not
204:11 - translating by the Z so I can add the Z
204:14 - all I want but if I don't actually when
204:18 - I draw them translate by the Z it won't
204:25 - show up oh no oh no I've run into a
204:33 - really horrible thing I need to sort
204:36 - them notice how they're not transparent
204:39 - anymore because of the Z sorting check
204:45 - the Twitter SoundCloud for the Christmas
204:48 - song somebody already remix my Christmas
204:50 - song that's crazy if that happened oh oh
204:55 - the humanity I can sort them I can sort
204:57 - them we're gonna sort them we're gonna
204:59 - get we're gonna do this but first I
205:02 - wanted to just let's just so let's do
205:06 - that
205:06 - so one of the things I need to do before
205:08 - I draw them and so I honestly I should
205:13 - really render them in a totally separate
205:15 - loop I'm gonna render them what I'm
205:20 - gonna do is I'm gonna say snow dot sort
205:24 - and I'm gonna use honey use the arrow
205:26 - function I'm gonna use arrow function a
205:28 - B right return what can I just say do I
205:34 - have to say return like if I do this a
205:38 - dot Z minus B dot Z Oh pause right
205:41 - somebody in the chat you might be
205:43 - wondering what I'm doing I probably
205:45 - should write this more beginner-friendly
205:46 - I'm gonna write this more
205:47 - beginner-friendly in a second so let's
205:49 - look at this one a more long-winded way
205:54 - compare
206:03 - returned a dot posi z- b dot pause Z oh
206:11 - my god there seriously is a remix
206:14 - already
206:18 - [Music]
206:27 - [Music]
206:45 - okay listen to that later okay okay so
206:50 - this is what I'm trying to do whenever
206:52 - you sort an array in JavaScript boy one
206:55 - I could just sort it by its default if
206:56 - it we're numbers are strings they would
206:58 - sort in alphabetical or numeric order
207:00 - but I can write a function that I got to
207:02 - turn the sound off I can write a
207:04 - function that tells you tells tells the
207:08 - array how to sort it and I want to sort
207:10 - it based on the Z value so I can't
207:12 - remember I just always start the
207:13 - negative value means put a in front of
207:15 - be a positive value means put beep in
207:17 - front of a if they're equal if they're
207:18 - equal so this should sort it one of the
207:21 - ways and this is just like a fancy es6
207:24 - way of writing this with the arrow
207:25 - syntax I think so
207:28 - boy I'm really not I'm just like okay so
207:30 - now okay we have a syntax error what I
207:35 - get wrong here one last parenthesis
207:39 - right well I did it so as long as I sort
207:46 - them so that I'm drawing either back to
207:48 - front or front to back we should be okay
207:50 - and now we can go put our rotation back
207:53 - in I'm missing all these messages oh my
207:58 - god there's a whole Frosty song now if I
208:05 - turn it around backwards you can see
208:07 - it's drawn in the wrong order but I'm
208:09 - not going to worry about that so I
208:10 - definitely want to make this Z quite
208:13 - more extreme so I'm going to I got to
208:18 - correct this like I'm not gonna correct
208:25 - this now I'm too lazy too lazy hope the
208:30 - camera went off
208:46 - sorry I forgot what I was doing
208:48 - I'm going to what was I doing
208:51 - oh yeah I'm just gonna make a I mean I'm
209:00 - gonna try this so let's try min Z max Z
209:06 - because I'm so lazy I don't want to read
209:09 - I'm too lazy to refactor the code just
209:12 - could have a global variable to go to
209:14 - your place okay I have it backwards okay
209:20 - so that's better so this is actually in
209:22 - 3d I mean it's not it's two-dimensional
209:26 - I think oh yeah so oh but I need to uh I
209:31 - want to have them more of them further
209:34 - away right no I don't this actually this
209:37 - will work this will that could seem more
209:39 - further away so this is fine
209:40 - suddenly Seymour okay so now here's the
209:43 - thing here's what's crazy about this if
209:46 - I were to put the rotation in and just
209:50 - say rotate I'm going to use that Z off
209:51 - variable but slow it down look at this
209:56 - as it spins the snow flakes are flat so
210:02 - they point to the side how can I make a
210:05 - snowflake continue to appear 3d and this
210:08 - is a technique known as billboarding so
210:11 - even though the camera view is changing
210:13 - if I always have the snowflake facing
210:15 - forward in other words if I go into the
210:19 - snowflake code wherever I'm rendering it
210:22 - and I all just undo that rotation and
210:29 - maybe I want to undo that rotation
210:31 - before I do the rotate Z then they
210:33 - should always be facing forward even as
210:35 - the camera swirls around right so
210:41 - there's some issues here with my
210:43 - clipping and the Z buffer does the
210:46 - sorting and the oh boy I really didn't
210:52 - just sort it the other way or no because
210:54 - it's spinning around I thought maybe if
210:56 - they were always yeah there
210:58 - be another way to fix this transparency
210:59 - but what I'm trying to show you is that
211:01 - I can have a three I could just remove
211:03 - through this no I'm pretty sure that the
211:07 - z-buffering I've done correctly but once
211:09 - I start rotating around yeah right cuz
211:14 - you're whoops oh no I don't I did it in
211:19 - two places
211:23 - yeah so if I just left it like this I'm
211:27 - not seeing that black brick thing I also
211:29 - need to as the things are set further
211:31 - away they need to start much higher up
211:33 - my view is all off so I'm gonna leave
211:35 - this this is a 3d version of it you
211:37 - could probably do a lot better by
211:40 - thinking about how you're gonna where
211:42 - you gonna see them how your know the
211:43 - particles are gonna color that there's
211:44 - so much more you could do but now you
211:45 - can see that you can actually also do
211:47 - this in WebGL and I think in theory
211:49 - what's nice about this is is that I
211:54 - probably could get away with let's try
211:57 - like 1400 of these you could see like
212:02 - it's you know there's some framerate
212:04 - issues but this performance in Fury is
212:07 - going to be much much faster than the 2d
212:10 - version okay so we did this in 3d if
212:15 - this ever gets edited into something
212:16 - this is now the end of this coding
212:18 - challenge that was a snowflake system in
212:21 - 2d and then in 3d and maybe you'll enjoy
212:24 - it
212:24 - and I'll see you in another coding
212:26 - challenge okay now me I am subbies sent
212:32 - me an excellent set of lyrics the real
212:35 - technique has just rotated all the
212:36 - snowflakes and then do the Z
212:37 - calculations okay now if the donations
212:43 - have risen above if that just round it
212:50 - to 3650 I will read I will sing me I am
212:56 - so bees last song
213:15 - Oh three six what we need four more
213:22 - dollars okay so while we're waiting for
213:24 - four more dollars let's take a look at
213:27 - Casey Reese explaining the origins of
213:30 - processing started from when we first
213:32 - start started processing I've been
213:34 - frying myself back in the olden times
213:39 - the primary aspiration was really to
213:42 - bring coding to a new audience of people
213:44 - and at that time in 2002 one the
213:48 - audience of new people we were
213:49 - interested in reaching was a community
213:52 - of artists and designers the community
213:54 - that yet previously hadn't really
213:55 - embraced coding as a way of making work
213:57 - as a way of expressing themselves and
213:59 - and communicating so the primary idea
214:02 - here is that we start sketching and we
214:05 - move from sketching which for me is
214:07 - thinking into sketching and code which
214:11 - the code then produces visual works and
214:13 - so the idea of sketching in code is a
214:16 - fundamental idea to the origins of the
214:18 - processing project you can have an idea
214:20 - write code quickly and see results
214:22 - quickly so when we started processing
214:25 - this was really the vision the vision
214:28 - was to be able to write these short
214:30 - programs that would then have a visual
214:32 - counterpart so this is a movie that I'll
214:34 - just let run for a moment it gives you a
214:36 - sense of the first kinds of things that
214:38 - we made with processing in the origin
214:40 - but what happened after was really
214:42 - unexpected and really exciting and it
214:45 - really cuts to the core of this idea of
214:47 - community Ben and I had some assumptions
214:49 - about what we wanted to do with
214:50 - processing but a lot of other people had
214:52 - other ideas about what they wanted to do
214:54 - um things that we had never imagined and
214:56 - so one of the early pieces of soft code
215:00 - that was written for processing with a
215:02 - library system that allowed other people
215:04 - to write code contributed back to the
215:06 - community to document that code and then
215:07 - people could do other things that for
215:10 - example these things on the list
215:11 - interfacing with different Hardware
215:13 - working with video working with audio
215:15 - etc things beyond that original scope
215:18 - really driven by the community and
215:20 - hopefully curated and encouraged through
215:22 - through the through the original work
215:25 - here's a few bullet points to sum up
215:28 - things that didn't
215:29 - we fit into that short discussion but
215:30 - these this idea of getting out of the
215:32 - lab and into the world you know taking
215:34 - things from this rare environment and
215:37 - and trying to open it up to a much
215:38 - larger group that processing from the
215:42 - very beginning was a language and
215:44 - environment that were intertwined so
215:46 - they were kind of no friction between
215:47 - the two that's that was the aim and then
215:50 - community was always an early focus but
215:52 - that community wasn't as an online
215:54 - community was an international community
215:56 - and I think the radical notion of today
215:58 - which were so excited about is that we
216:01 - can also hopefully foster local
216:04 - community too
216:06 - and meet in real life meet face to face
216:08 - which is something we haven't done until
216:10 - today sixteen years later so I think
216:12 - that's one reason why we're nervous and
216:13 - excited about today okay so I need to
216:24 - thank the donors and I think this is
216:27 - probably gonna be the last bit but I'm
216:31 - still trying to get set up here to see
216:35 - if I can get the music here that I need
216:37 - oh here we go this is good this will be
216:41 - good this is gonna be really tough let
216:45 - me just put this here okay so hold on
216:49 - this will be good for Thank You Casey
216:51 - for telling us about processing let's I
216:59 - took the oscillation out I kind of like
217:01 - the 2d one better but let's go make a
217:06 - nice background here enter full screen
217:10 - fresh okay so here's our snow system and
217:17 - now I am going to where's the where's my
217:26 - panel okay here it is so I'm going to
217:31 - thank the donors that have donated since
217:34 - we have thank you to Shawn from Bristol
217:38 - UK and
217:42 - thank you - thank you - anonymous donor
217:48 - processing p5.js is just fantastic keep
217:51 - up the great work thanks for the nice
217:52 - message and keep Dan singing another
217:57 - donation from some of you donated
217:59 - earlier I do not want to enable
218:01 - dictation not now and Gemma and then one
218:08 - more donation to read Thank You
218:11 - anonymous donation we have now made it
218:14 - all the way up to three thousand six
218:21 - hundred sixty dollars donated by 115
218:23 - donors in the month of December okay so
218:28 - now what I need to do is try to get the
218:31 - music oh my goodness this is gonna be
218:32 - pretty much impossible
218:35 - it's might I might want to do this on
218:38 - the green screen because then I can have
218:43 - then I can have the music I'm by the way
218:47 - I said four more dollars whatever that's
218:48 - the only donated but I was going to do
218:50 - it anyway but the music's kind of
218:55 - complicated for this one it might help
218:57 - me to have two different screens let's
218:59 - see let's see if you guys can tolerate
219:00 - this so let me get the lyrics going here
219:04 - they really do need to be near each
219:06 - other okay now let me go to here I'm
219:15 - gonna switch to this apologies for
219:18 - everybody's eyes how's the volume level
219:21 - of the piano and I'm gonna quit this
219:25 - with this quit this and I'm gonna get to
219:30 - hold on okay
219:39 - if I had a printer in this room so make
219:43 - things a lot easier okay all right thank
219:49 - you me I am so me for these lyrics for
219:52 - another holiday song and I have not ever
219:56 - played before in my life or son nor yeah
220:01 - so heroes here he goes I'm gonna be
220:02 - sight reading this and by the way I'm
220:04 - really terrible at the piano so my
220:06 - sacred you won't recognize it cuz I'm
220:15 - totally not playing the rhythm I'm just
220:20 - making up my own stylish version of this
220:21 - [Music]
220:32 - that was that's the intro Frosty the
220:43 - repo was a react based web site with a
220:54 - input field input field and uh but
221:04 - didn't note and two eyes made and two
221:10 - eyes made out of radio buttons quickly
221:15 - Oh
221:18 - page to page to page frosty the repo is
221:25 - a fairy tale they say oh no no I got off
221:29 - there the rebo is a fairy tale they say
221:36 - [Music]
221:38 - he was made of snow but the children
221:47 - know
221:49 - [Music]
221:52 - how his backgrounds the default there
222:01 - must have been some not magic magic in
222:10 - that library they found for I don't know
222:20 - his son before when they placed it began
222:35 - to dance around Oh frosty the hey the
223:01 - actual words doesn't count he could
223:10 - laugh all day play just the same as you
223:17 - and me
223:17 - hey this is these are the actual is the
223:20 - actual it's just frosty the repo

224:11 - here for five hours about five hours so
224:15 - I think this has to be the end of the
224:17 - processing foundation telethon
224:19 - fundraiser Thanks to everyone who
224:20 - donated thank you for all thank you
224:26 - everybody for being here on this
224:28 - livestream please the donations are open
224:30 - forever we do have this goal to try to
224:34 - get to twenty thousand dollars in
224:35 - December be great to see if this number
224:36 - can get up maybe we can get at least
224:37 - into five figures and I look forward to
224:43 - everyone's crazy music video remixes of
224:46 - all of my coding holiday music and I
224:48 - will be back I'm very happy to come back
224:50 - and redo any songs that I need to at any
224:54 - point did I mute myself I don't know
224:57 - what's going on I'm exhausted
224:59 - I gotta go I do actually have to record
225:01 - a couple intros to some other videos
225:04 - that I need to post I got a lot of
225:05 - content that's coming out and
225:09 - that's that mmm all right happy holidays
225:12 - everybody enjoy your vacation break

225:19 - somewhere cold or warm or dark or light
225:22 - give a hug to your friends and neighbors
225:24 - take a break from code do something nice
225:27 - for somebody be out in the actual nature
225:30 - recycle I don't know do lots of things
225:32 - that are good for the world and that
225:35 - sort of thing okay and things like that
225:40 - I don't anyone got that reference so
225:43 - this will be apparently archived forever
225:47 - oh I do reserve the right not to archive
225:51 - this forever but it will be it will be
225:53 - it will be I'm gonna hit the stop
225:54 - streaming on the stop recording button
225:56 - and I am going to that's it so I'll see
226:04 - you later bye see you in the new year
226:06 - see in 2018 goodbye everybody thanks for
226:08 - watching thanks for being here
226:10 - and I'm just gonna check the slack chat
226:12 - to make sure there wasn't like an
226:13 - important question there's some remixes
226:16 - here alright thanks everybody and good
226:21 - night
