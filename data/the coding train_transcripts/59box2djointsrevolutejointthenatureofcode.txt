00:01 - now that we've looked at a distance
00:03 - joint let's look at another example of a
00:05 - joint a revolute joint okay I'm excited
00:08 - about this are you excited I'm excited
00:09 - okay here we go so a distance joint now
00:12 - here's the thing a distance joint
00:14 - remember we had two bodies let's say we
00:16 - had a square and a triangle we combined
00:20 - those with the distance joint which
00:22 - connects each body together with a given
00:24 - length one of the things about a
00:26 - revolute joint that is incredibly
00:29 - different is that a revolute joint binds
00:33 - those two bodies at a singular anchor
00:37 - point
00:40 - what is that anchor point that anchor
00:43 - point is the point around which those
00:45 - bodies revolve so you can think of it
00:47 - essentially as you know if we have this
00:49 - if we if we have this fixed plate and we
00:52 - attach this triangle to it and we put a
00:54 - little screw in it's kind of loose we
00:55 - could spin that triangle around that
00:57 - plate that makes any sense and you can
00:58 - see in the example what we're gonna use
01:00 - this for is to create something that it
01:02 - resembles like a windmill so something
01:04 - spinning around spinning around a
01:06 - singular point okay so how do we do that
01:08 - well we do the same exact thing we did
01:10 - with the distance joint we have two
01:12 - bodies ready to go we define a joint
01:15 - definition a revolute joint definition
01:17 - and then we set all the parameters what
01:19 - are the parameters for a revolute joint
01:21 - now there are a bunch but one of the
01:26 - things that's really key is when we
01:28 - initialize it is what in addition to
01:31 - setting the two bodies we've got to set
01:32 - where that anchor point is so we've got
01:34 - a we've got to make sure we set where
01:36 - the anchor point is and so that's one of
01:38 - the parameters the anchor point other
01:42 - parameters we're gonna set R is the
01:45 - motor on now motors you ask yourself
01:48 - what there's a motor so this is one of
01:51 - the cool things about box2d
01:52 - is it has these concepts built into it
01:54 - that you can suddenly kind of like
01:56 - there's like electricity in the world
01:58 - and systems are gas burning something
02:01 - whatever but we can actually turn this
02:03 - motor on so then this autonomously will
02:05 - spin and will spin with a certain force
02:07 - with a given torque which is you know if
02:10 - you wanted to have itself a driving car
02:12 - or some type of spinning windmill this
02:15 - is where you can use revolute joints and
02:17 - motors which is pretty great to see so
02:19 - we can turn the motor on there is a
02:22 - motor speed parameter there is a motor
02:26 - torque parameter and the other thing we
02:28 - can do is we can limit the angle so this
02:34 - is the thing there's so many possible
02:36 - ways you could kind of configure and set
02:38 - a revolute joint the key thing for us to
02:40 - really be comfortable with is the
02:42 - beginning we have two bodies we make the
02:44 - joint definition we set the anchor point
02:46 - and we let it go now we could also
02:49 - constrain the angle we could turn a
02:51 - motor on and off and we'll look at that
02:52 - stuff when we look at the actual code
02:54 - and once we've set all that we can
02:55 - create the joint okay so let's see if I
02:58 - forgot anything crucial let's go over
03:00 - here and take a look at it so here's the
03:01 - example running and we can see we have
03:03 - one fixed body and one body that's not
03:06 - fixed both of those are attached with a
03:08 - revolute joint now the motor is not on
03:10 - so as the particles just hit the thing
03:12 - you kind of just seesaws back and forth
03:15 - based on the force of where these are
03:17 - the particles are randomly hitting it
03:18 - but if I click the mouse the motor is
03:22 - going to be on and you can see it's like
03:23 - forcing itself to spin now in a
03:25 - clockwise direction and we can affect
03:27 - them the motor speed so what's going on
03:29 - here in this example one thing I should
03:31 - point out is we have a particle class
03:32 - and let me move this off to the side
03:35 - here we have a particle class which is
03:37 - all those circles right so though that's
03:39 - the object that controls the box of
03:41 - these circular body that's falling from
03:43 - the sky we have this box class which
03:45 - describes a box a sink which is used for
03:48 - both of these bodies that are connected
03:51 - with that revolute joint so then we're
03:53 - doing the same thing we did in the
03:54 - distance joint example where we have a
03:56 - class this class has a reference to two
03:59 - box objects and a joint so we're using a
04:02 - class to kind of describe a multitude of
04:04 - box2d bodies we could say every time we
04:06 - want a windmill we need this box and
04:08 - this box and a joint that connects them
04:10 - so if we look here we've got these steps
04:12 - again define the joint revolute joint
04:15 - has a nice function called initialize
04:16 - where we say hey here's the joint this
04:19 - body and the it's going to connect box
04:21 - one body box to body and then here's the
04:23 - anchor point the anchor point is that
04:25 - box
04:26 - one center so that's really key to see
04:28 - in the initialized function the third
04:30 - argument is the anchor point which is
04:32 - the point that where the two are
04:33 - connected to each other then we can see
04:36 - here are some properties we can give it
04:39 - a motor speed a motor torque is the
04:41 - motor on its off at first so you can see
04:44 - and you can look up in the manual there
04:45 - are great that a longer list of
04:47 - properties and when I have this system
04:49 - that I imagined that it'll be this
04:51 - magical thing we're below you will see
04:52 - the list of properties just appear that
04:54 - I'm talking about but anyway that's so
04:56 - that's gonna happen in the future when
04:57 - these videos are better anyway so one
05:00 - thing that you can see that's a little
05:01 - bit different about this than the
05:02 - distance joint example is we are keeping
05:04 - a reference to that joint object why
05:06 - because we want to be able to turn the
05:08 - motor on and off we might want to affect
05:10 - its speed its torque all that kind of
05:11 - stuff later and we can see that's what
05:13 - we're doing in the main program when we
05:15 - click the mouse we say hey toggle the
05:17 - motor and in that function we we can
05:20 - call we can set the motors a status to
05:23 - false or true which means it's off or on
05:25 - okay so hopefully this gives you kind of
05:27 - an overview again there's a lot of
05:28 - details here that I'm just kind of kind
05:30 - of glossing over and we'll see what's
05:32 - missed and what's confusing but the
05:34 - point is here it's the same thing we
05:36 - need two bodies we need to create a
05:38 - joint object between those two bodies
05:40 - and set a few parameters and then letter
05:42 - up and see how it goes so I would say as
05:45 - an exercise I can't think of one that
05:48 - one prepared but you could for example
05:51 - try to create the wheels of a vehicle
05:53 - with a motor joint see if you can get it
05:55 - to drive itself there's actually
05:56 - something called a wheel joint in box2d
05:58 - but try using a revolute joint first see
06:00 - how that works and yeah I remembered I
06:05 - forgot something in the previous video
06:06 - but maybe I'll go add that back in real
06:07 - quick okay so yeah thank you
