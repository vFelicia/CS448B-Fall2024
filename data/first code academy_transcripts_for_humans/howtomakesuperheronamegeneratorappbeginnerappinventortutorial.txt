00:00 - hello everyone welcome to first code
00:01 - academy today we're going to do a
00:03 - project on app inventor
00:05 - called name generator in this project
00:07 - you'll be creating a simple mobile app
00:09 - in which the user will answer a few
00:11 - questions and a superhero name will be
00:13 - generated according to the user's answer
00:16 - so let's have a look at um a demo here
00:19 - of the app
00:20 - so the first question is what is your
00:22 - favorite color we can click here to
00:24 - choose one
00:25 - and as you can see we have quite a few
00:27 - options i'm gonna go with
00:29 - um pink all right and what is your um
00:32 - potato chip flavor i'm gonna go with
00:36 - flaming hot and then what do you like to
00:39 - do in your free time
00:41 - i'm gonna go ahead with watch youtube
00:45 - and then i'm going to click generate now
00:47 - to see what my superhero name is
00:50 - and i get incredible invisible theory
00:52 - all right so to begin
00:54 - let's start with creating the appearance
00:56 - of the app so now i'm in my app inventor
01:00 - project i'm going to go ahead with
01:02 - adding a label
01:04 - all right and then i'm going to go to
01:06 - text and type in the question
01:08 - so my first question is what is your
01:11 - favorite
01:12 - color okay so as you can see now our
01:15 - label is
01:16 - displaying that now the next step would
01:20 - be to add in the
01:21 - options for the user to choose so we're
01:23 - going to use the list picker to do that
01:25 - and we're going to drag it
01:27 - to below our label all right now we
01:31 - don't want it to say text for list
01:32 - picker one so we're gonna go to
01:35 - text delete that and type in
01:38 - choose one all right
01:42 - now what we're going to do next is we're
01:44 - going to go ahead and add in the options
01:46 - we're
01:46 - going to do that in elements from string
01:49 - now since i'm going to add in 12 options
01:51 - i have
01:52 - typed my options somewhere else i'm
01:54 - going to go ahead from
01:55 - that place and paste it onto
01:59 - my elements from string all right
02:03 - so these are my options i added in 12.
02:06 - so as you can see
02:07 - okay i'm going to zoom in you need to
02:09 - make sure that you separate
02:11 - your options with a comma okay so i have
02:14 - red orange yellow green turquoise all
02:16 - the way to white
02:18 - all right so that's my first question
02:20 - and options done
02:22 - i'm going to go ahead and add in my
02:23 - second question
02:25 - okay and go to text
02:28 - my second question will be what is your
02:30 - favorite potato chip flavor
02:33 - favorite potato chip
02:36 - flavor
02:40 - okay and then grab a list picker just
02:43 - like we did
02:45 - go to text make it choose one again
02:51 - all right and then it's time to go to
02:54 - elements from string and add in your
02:56 - options
02:58 - so i have them typed somewhere else as
03:00 - well
03:01 - these are my options i have classic
03:04 - bbq salt and vinegar sour cream all of
03:08 - that
03:08 - in here okay and i separate them with a
03:11 - comma
03:12 - so you can drag the corner of the text
03:16 - box right here so that
03:18 - you can see your options
03:21 - okay now i'm gonna go with my third
03:23 - question
03:25 - and i'm gonna type in what do you like
03:28 - to do in your free time
03:30 - like to do in your free time
03:38 - all right what do you like to do in your
03:39 - free time okay and then grab a list
03:41 - picker
03:43 - change the text to choose one
03:48 - and then add in the options all right
03:51 - i'm gonna have a look
03:55 - okay so these are my options right here
03:58 - now the last thing is we need to go
04:01 - ahead and add in
04:02 - a button so this button is going to be
04:04 - the thing you click
04:05 - which will generate the superhero name
04:08 - for you
04:09 - so we get the button we change the text
04:13 - to
04:15 - generate super hero
04:18 - name
04:23 - all right generate superhero name and
04:25 - then
04:26 - we need a label again to show the users
04:29 - what their superhero name is so this one
04:33 - i'm going to go to text and change it to
04:35 - your super
04:36 - hero name is okay
04:40 - and the label that's actually going to
04:42 - show
04:43 - you the super hearing aid another one
04:46 - right there
04:47 - below the um label okay and for this one
04:51 - we won't know what it is until they have
04:53 - um chose
04:55 - chosen their options so we're gonna make
04:56 - it blank we can go to text
04:58 - delete text for label five all right
05:02 - and what we wanna do is we wanna rename
05:05 - this label because we have quite a bit
05:07 - of labels
05:08 - okay so when we code it's going to be
05:09 - easier if you rename them
05:11 - so that you know which ones you actually
05:13 - want to put the text in
05:16 - so you rename it to result
05:21 - okay all right so we have our three
05:23 - questions
05:24 - we have the um button to generate the
05:27 - superhero name
05:28 - we have the label that shows your
05:30 - superhero name is
05:32 - and then the actual label okay called
05:35 - result
05:35 - that's going to display it and that's it
05:38 - for
05:39 - the app design we're going to go ahead
05:41 - and start coding next
05:42 - all right so now i'm in the blocks mode
05:44 - where we're going to do the coding for
05:46 - the app
05:47 - now to start with we have to prepare
05:49 - list of names that match with the user's
05:52 - selection so i have i'm going to do
05:54 - color list flavorless and hobby list
05:57 - all right so we go to variables we're
06:00 - going to initialize
06:01 - three okay
06:06 - and then the first one since i'm asking
06:08 - about color i'm gonna change it to
06:10 - color list like so
06:14 - right and i'm gonna make a list of all
06:16 - of the
06:17 - choices okay so i'm going to go ahead
06:21 - and add 12 because i gave the users 12
06:23 - choices in the beginning to choose from
06:34 - all right so now i have 12 choices right
06:37 - here
06:38 - i'm gonna go ahead and type in my first
06:40 - one
06:41 - so my first one right here let's say in
06:43 - the beginning for
06:44 - the color the user chose red then i'm
06:48 - going to go ahead
06:49 - and say what their
06:52 - first part of their superhero name is
06:54 - going to be if they chose red
06:56 - so for me i'm going to go with captain
07:01 - all right now the second bit
07:05 - okay if they choose another color i'm
07:07 - going to make the first part
07:08 - doctor okay
07:12 - duplicate it put it here
07:15 - then the other one will be the great
07:23 - all right and then i do turbo
07:33 - okay so you can keep duplicating for
07:36 - each of the
07:37 - options that you provided
07:52 - okay so this is the first part of this
07:54 - super hearing aid
07:56 - which is generated from when the user
07:58 - chooses a color
08:12 - and then my last one will be invincible
08:19 - so the first part of the name is done
08:21 - all right which is generated from the
08:23 - color
08:23 - color list so i'm going to shrink it and
08:27 - keep it here
08:28 - now the second part is going to be from
08:30 - the flavor
08:31 - of the potato chip right so we can name
08:33 - this
08:34 - flavor okay
08:42 - chip flavor maybe
08:46 - okay and we're gonna go ahead and add in
08:48 - the options again
08:49 - so i'm actually gonna copy this one
08:52 - right here okay
08:54 - duplicate and close this
08:57 - put it here and of course i'm going to
08:59 - change in the options in here
09:03 - so for the flavor list the first one i'm
09:07 - going to add is
09:08 - evil and of course you can choose your
09:12 - own
09:12 - um name so i'm going to go with speedy
09:26 - so these are all um superhero powers
09:29 - evil speedy funny flying mind reading
09:58 - so that's from the chip flavor these are
10:01 - the words the second part of the
10:02 - superhero name
10:04 - now for the third part it's going to be
10:06 - from hobby
10:09 - okay and then again i'm going to make a
10:11 - list of
10:12 - words i'm going to put this right here
10:18 - all right now the first word i'm going
10:20 - to do is
10:22 - ninja and maybe agent
10:56 - all right so these are all the words
10:59 - that i'm going to
11:01 - use to generate the superhero name now
11:03 - the next thing that i'm going to do
11:05 - is i'm going to go ahead and update the
11:07 - selection
11:08 - after an answer has been picked all
11:11 - right so we need to update the
11:12 - listpicker.txt
11:14 - in all three list picker components now
11:17 - we're going to do that
11:18 - by going to list picker okay list picker
11:22 - one
11:24 - and we're going to say when
11:26 - listpicker1.afterpicking picking
11:27 - we're gonna do that for all three list
11:28 - pickers okay
11:30 - change this to list picker two and then
11:33 - lastly we have
11:34 - list picker three all right let's pick
11:38 - your one list picker two and list picker
11:40 - three
11:41 - and then after we have that we're gonna
11:43 - say okay we wanna change
11:46 - the text of the list picker to whatever
11:48 - the user has chosen
11:50 - so to do that we're gonna say we wanna
11:53 - set
11:55 - okay list picker dot text
11:58 - to whatever the user has chosen so that
12:02 - would be list picker
12:03 - dot selection
12:07 - okay right here
12:12 - all right so the first one is done we
12:16 - can just
12:17 - duplicate it and then put it into the
12:20 - second one
12:20 - but don't forget make sure you change it
12:22 - to list picker two
12:25 - and then the last one would be list
12:26 - picker three
12:29 - all right okay i'm also going to
12:32 - shrink these blocks so i'm gonna
12:35 - collapse
12:37 - collapse then collapse
12:41 - all right now after i'm done with that
12:44 - the next thing i'm going to do
12:46 - is i want the name to be generated
12:48 - according to the user's choice
12:50 - so if the user's choice is the first
12:52 - selection in the list picker one
12:54 - then the name generated um will be the
12:56 - first name
12:57 - in the first list so it would be
13:01 - this list right here right okay
13:07 - and then i also want to check the
13:09 - selection
13:10 - and we'll create a procedure to select
13:13 - the selection list
13:14 - and obtain the index from the user's
13:16 - choice
13:17 - which we will name check selection right
13:20 - and we want to call
13:21 - check selection when the user presses
13:23 - the generate button
13:24 - and pressing the generate button also
13:27 - resets the list picker text to choose
13:29 - one okay so we're gonna initialize
13:36 - three things some variables
13:42 - okay and the first one like i said we're
13:45 - gonna make it selection one
13:48 - selection one selection
13:52 - two and selection
13:55 - three all right now after we do that
13:59 - we need to go ahead and
14:02 - put in empty text boxes like so
14:07 - okay because we're not sure yet what
14:09 - they will choose
14:10 - i put that here like a placeholder
14:16 - okay and then next we would need to set
14:19 - the three variable to store the selected
14:21 - items from
14:22 - the list okay so to do that we're gonna
14:26 - need to open
14:27 - these three codes right here
14:31 - and then we say all right
14:36 - set okay so we see selection one
14:40 - so it's that selection one
14:45 - to whatever we have chosen
14:50 - so that would be list picker one
14:55 - dot selection index right because we
14:59 - want to match
14:59 - what we chose to what the
15:03 - name will be selection index
15:07 - okay so we can copy this put it right
15:11 - here
15:12 - now make sure it's list thicker too and
15:18 - uh selection two oops this one should
15:20 - have been this figure two
15:22 - okay and then lastly
15:26 - for our list picker 3 change it to
15:29 - selection 3 and
15:31 - let's pick for 3. make sure to change
15:33 - this one right here as well
15:38 - all right so now whenever the user
15:42 - chooses something we're going to match
15:44 - it to one of the
15:46 - options here okay for each of the
15:48 - questions they're going to be matched to
15:50 - one of these words
15:52 - okay now i'm going to shrink them again
16:00 - now that we have the selection index we
16:02 - need to create the procedure block to
16:04 - select the
16:05 - selection list and obtain the index from
16:08 - the user's choice which we will name
16:10 - as check selection
16:13 - so we're going to go to procedure all
16:16 - right it's the
16:17 - purple color block and then we are
16:20 - going to say to procedure
16:23 - result and like i said we're going to
16:27 - name this
16:28 - check selection so check selection
16:34 - all right and then we are going to have
16:37 - two parameters so we can have
16:43 - inputs right two inputs
16:48 - now the first input we are going to call
16:51 - it list
16:53 - okay so list the second input we're
16:55 - going to call it
16:56 - selection index
17:00 - like so so list and selection index
17:03 - and then we're going to go ahead and say
17:07 - it's a list and we're going to say
17:09 - select list item
17:11 - list and index
17:14 - okay for the list it will depend on
17:18 - which list you've got so get list
17:23 - and then index it will be just the
17:26 - parameter we
17:27 - did the input we did which is get
17:30 - selection index
17:32 - all right now that we're done with this
17:34 - part okay we're gonna go ahead and code
17:36 - the generate button
17:39 - so we can go ahead that's button one
17:43 - okay so when button1.click something
17:45 - should happen
17:46 - okay i'm gonna shrink these ones again
17:53 - all of those okay one button one dot
17:56 - click
17:58 - so when button1.click we need to set the
18:00 - name label now so the label that's going
18:02 - to
18:03 - um show the your superhero name
18:07 - so that's results right here
18:11 - and then set dot result.text
18:15 - to something okay we put that right here
18:20 - and we have three components in the
18:23 - super heroes name so we need to use
18:27 - something called join it's right here in
18:29 - text
18:30 - okay bring that and connect it here
18:36 - all right now that we have join we're
18:39 - going to
18:40 - call the procedure that we have created
18:43 - okay so we're going to call check
18:45 - selection
18:51 - then in the call check selection we're
18:53 - going to get
18:55 - first of all the color list okay so we
18:58 - go to
18:58 - variables we get this method
19:03 - okay now selection index so which one
19:06 - they have selected
19:08 - we're gonna go ahead and get selection
19:11 - one
19:12 - okay which is a variable we generate uh
19:14 - we initialized here
19:16 - get selection one
19:20 - all right now the next thing we need to
19:22 - do is we need to add
19:24 - a little bit of space in between each
19:26 - word right we don't want them
19:27 - all stuck together so we're going to add
19:29 - in an empty text box
19:32 - like so all right and then we need more
19:36 - two more words so we need to add some
19:38 - more spaces
19:40 - okay and we also need to think about the
19:43 - space in between the words so i'm going
19:45 - to add in
19:47 - let's say this much right so four more
19:52 - then i'm going to duplicate this call
19:54 - again
19:55 - but this time it's not colorless it's
19:59 - your chip flavor list and global
20:02 - selection
20:02 - too put in the spacer
20:06 - again all right and then
20:09 - lastly we call the selection
20:12 - right here change it to get global
20:16 - hobby and it would be your third
20:19 - selection
20:21 - all right and for this one since it's
20:24 - the last word we don't really need the
20:25 - space i'm going to remove it
20:29 - okay you can just drag it out like that
20:31 - all right
20:33 - then that's it for the coding part of
20:36 - this
20:37 - app okay so you can go ahead and try it
20:39 - using your
20:40 - android phone by clicking on connect
20:44 - and ai companion or you can use
20:47 - bluestacks
20:48 - an app where you can look at android
20:50 - apps so that's all for today i hope you
20:52 - enjoyed this project

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we're going to do a project on app inventor called name generator in this project you'll be creating a simple mobile app in which the user will answer a few questions and a superhero name will be generated according to the user's answer so let's have a look at um a demo here of the app so the first question is what is your favorite color we can click here to choose one and as you can see we have quite a few options i'm gonna go with um pink all right and what is your um potato chip flavor i'm gonna go with flaming hot and then what do you like to do in your free time i'm gonna go ahead with watch youtube and then i'm going to click generate now to see what my superhero name is and i get incredible invisible theory all right so to begin let's start with creating the appearance of the app so now i'm in my app inventor project i'm going to go ahead with adding a label all right and then i'm going to go to text and type in the question so my first question is what is your favorite color okay so as you can see now our label is displaying that now the next step would be to add in the options for the user to choose so we're going to use the list picker to do that and we're going to drag it to below our label all right now we don't want it to say text for list picker one so we're gonna go to text delete that and type in choose one all right now what we're going to do next is we're going to go ahead and add in the options we're going to do that in elements from string now since i'm going to add in 12 options i have typed my options somewhere else i'm going to go ahead from that place and paste it onto my elements from string all right so these are my options i added in 12. so as you can see okay i'm going to zoom in you need to make sure that you separate your options with a comma okay so i have red orange yellow green turquoise all the way to white all right so that's my first question and options done i'm going to go ahead and add in my second question okay and go to text my second question will be what is your favorite potato chip flavor favorite potato chip flavor okay and then grab a list picker just like we did go to text make it choose one again all right and then it's time to go to elements from string and add in your options so i have them typed somewhere else as well these are my options i have classic bbq salt and vinegar sour cream all of that in here okay and i separate them with a comma so you can drag the corner of the text box right here so that you can see your options okay now i'm gonna go with my third question and i'm gonna type in what do you like to do in your free time like to do in your free time all right what do you like to do in your free time okay and then grab a list picker change the text to choose one and then add in the options all right i'm gonna have a look okay so these are my options right here now the last thing is we need to go ahead and add in a button so this button is going to be the thing you click which will generate the superhero name for you so we get the button we change the text to generate super hero name all right generate superhero name and then we need a label again to show the users what their superhero name is so this one i'm going to go to text and change it to your super hero name is okay and the label that's actually going to show you the super hearing aid another one right there below the um label okay and for this one we won't know what it is until they have um chose chosen their options so we're gonna make it blank we can go to text delete text for label five all right and what we wanna do is we wanna rename this label because we have quite a bit of labels okay so when we code it's going to be easier if you rename them so that you know which ones you actually want to put the text in so you rename it to result okay all right so we have our three questions we have the um button to generate the superhero name we have the label that shows your superhero name is and then the actual label okay called result that's going to display it and that's it for the app design we're going to go ahead and start coding next all right so now i'm in the blocks mode where we're going to do the coding for the app now to start with we have to prepare list of names that match with the user's selection so i have i'm going to do color list flavorless and hobby list all right so we go to variables we're going to initialize three okay and then the first one since i'm asking about color i'm gonna change it to color list like so right and i'm gonna make a list of all of the choices okay so i'm going to go ahead and add 12 because i gave the users 12 choices in the beginning to choose from all right so now i have 12 choices right here i'm gonna go ahead and type in my first one so my first one right here let's say in the beginning for the color the user chose red then i'm going to go ahead and say what their first part of their superhero name is going to be if they chose red so for me i'm going to go with captain all right now the second bit okay if they choose another color i'm going to make the first part doctor okay duplicate it put it here then the other one will be the great all right and then i do turbo okay so you can keep duplicating for each of the options that you provided okay so this is the first part of this super hearing aid which is generated from when the user chooses a color and then my last one will be invincible so the first part of the name is done all right which is generated from the color color list so i'm going to shrink it and keep it here now the second part is going to be from the flavor of the potato chip right so we can name this flavor okay chip flavor maybe okay and we're gonna go ahead and add in the options again so i'm actually gonna copy this one right here okay duplicate and close this put it here and of course i'm going to change in the options in here so for the flavor list the first one i'm going to add is evil and of course you can choose your own um name so i'm going to go with speedy so these are all um superhero powers evil speedy funny flying mind reading so that's from the chip flavor these are the words the second part of the superhero name now for the third part it's going to be from hobby okay and then again i'm going to make a list of words i'm going to put this right here all right now the first word i'm going to do is ninja and maybe agent all right so these are all the words that i'm going to use to generate the superhero name now the next thing that i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and update the selection after an answer has been picked all right so we need to update the listpicker.txt in all three list picker components now we're going to do that by going to list picker okay list picker one and we're going to say when listpicker1.afterpicking picking we're gonna do that for all three list pickers okay change this to list picker two and then lastly we have list picker three all right let's pick your one list picker two and list picker three and then after we have that we're gonna say okay we wanna change the text of the list picker to whatever the user has chosen so to do that we're gonna say we wanna set okay list picker dot text to whatever the user has chosen so that would be list picker dot selection okay right here all right so the first one is done we can just duplicate it and then put it into the second one but don't forget make sure you change it to list picker two and then the last one would be list picker three all right okay i'm also going to shrink these blocks so i'm gonna collapse collapse then collapse all right now after i'm done with that the next thing i'm going to do is i want the name to be generated according to the user's choice so if the user's choice is the first selection in the list picker one then the name generated um will be the first name in the first list so it would be this list right here right okay and then i also want to check the selection and we'll create a procedure to select the selection list and obtain the index from the user's choice which we will name check selection right and we want to call check selection when the user presses the generate button and pressing the generate button also resets the list picker text to choose one okay so we're gonna initialize three things some variables okay and the first one like i said we're gonna make it selection one selection one selection two and selection three all right now after we do that we need to go ahead and put in empty text boxes like so okay because we're not sure yet what they will choose i put that here like a placeholder okay and then next we would need to set the three variable to store the selected items from the list okay so to do that we're gonna need to open these three codes right here and then we say all right set okay so we see selection one so it's that selection one to whatever we have chosen so that would be list picker one dot selection index right because we want to match what we chose to what the name will be selection index okay so we can copy this put it right here now make sure it's list thicker too and uh selection two oops this one should have been this figure two okay and then lastly for our list picker 3 change it to selection 3 and let's pick for 3. make sure to change this one right here as well all right so now whenever the user chooses something we're going to match it to one of the options here okay for each of the questions they're going to be matched to one of these words okay now i'm going to shrink them again now that we have the selection index we need to create the procedure block to select the selection list and obtain the index from the user's choice which we will name as check selection so we're going to go to procedure all right it's the purple color block and then we are going to say to procedure result and like i said we're going to name this check selection so check selection all right and then we are going to have two parameters so we can have inputs right two inputs now the first input we are going to call it list okay so list the second input we're going to call it selection index like so so list and selection index and then we're going to go ahead and say it's a list and we're going to say select list item list and index okay for the list it will depend on which list you've got so get list and then index it will be just the parameter we did the input we did which is get selection index all right now that we're done with this part okay we're gonna go ahead and code the generate button so we can go ahead that's button one okay so when button1.click something should happen okay i'm gonna shrink these ones again all of those okay one button one dot click so when button1.click we need to set the name label now so the label that's going to um show the your superhero name so that's results right here and then set dot result.text to something okay we put that right here and we have three components in the super heroes name so we need to use something called join it's right here in text okay bring that and connect it here all right now that we have join we're going to call the procedure that we have created okay so we're going to call check selection then in the call check selection we're going to get first of all the color list okay so we go to variables we get this method okay now selection index so which one they have selected we're gonna go ahead and get selection one okay which is a variable we generate uh we initialized here get selection one all right now the next thing we need to do is we need to add a little bit of space in between each word right we don't want them all stuck together so we're going to add in an empty text box like so all right and then we need more two more words so we need to add some more spaces okay and we also need to think about the space in between the words so i'm going to add in let's say this much right so four more then i'm going to duplicate this call again but this time it's not colorless it's your chip flavor list and global selection too put in the spacer again all right and then lastly we call the selection right here change it to get global hobby and it would be your third selection all right and for this one since it's the last word we don't really need the space i'm going to remove it okay you can just drag it out like that all right then that's it for the coding part of this app okay so you can go ahead and try it using your android phone by clicking on connect and ai companion or you can use bluestacks an app where you can look at android apps so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed this project and remember to give us a thumbs up if you like it and don't forget to hit subscribe um button to get new tutorials and thank you bye
