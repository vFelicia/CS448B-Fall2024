00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share beginner friendly
00:04 - tutorials on roblox
00:06 - minecraft scratch and many more
00:09 - today we'll be doing a special project
00:11 - with mother's day coming up
00:13 - we'll be creating a mother's day card on
00:15 - scratch so let's go ahead and take a
00:17 - look at the project
00:19 - alright so in this project we'll be
00:20 - creating a mother's day card which
00:22 - displays a custom message to your mother
00:25 - when the card is open in this project
00:27 - we'll be using
00:28 - costumes of sprites to make it more
00:30 - lively we'll be using custom costumes
00:32 - and we will also be using concept of
00:34 - clones
00:35 - and broadcast messages to pop up
00:37 - particular sprites at a given time
00:40 - let's take a look at the project first
00:42 - so when i click on the card
00:44 - it will open and it will display happy
00:47 - mother's day
00:48 - and there will be another spike that
00:49 - pops up which i can click on
00:52 - which says press letter to read and then
00:54 - it will display
00:55 - your custom message that you want to
00:57 - write for your mother
00:59 - so let's get started with this project
01:01 - alright so next
01:02 - we're going to create a new project on
01:04 - scratch now you can go to scratch by
01:06 - going to
01:08 - scratch.mit.edu the link will also be in
01:10 - the description down below
01:12 - then you will go to create and we'll be
01:14 - creating a new
01:16 - project
01:19 - now once we start a new project we're
01:21 - going to straight away delete this cap
01:23 - because we're not going to be using this
01:24 - in our project and we're going to be
01:26 - uploading
01:27 - our custom sprites now you can go ahead
01:30 - and download custom sprites
01:31 - um yourself as well but make sure they
01:33 - are transparent background so it'll be
01:35 - easier for you
01:36 - for this project i'm going to be using
01:38 - these
01:40 - an envelope a message a letter and some
01:42 - flowers
01:43 - all of those sprites will be available
01:45 - to you as well in the description down
01:46 - below
01:47 - so you can go ahead and download those
01:50 - and once you download those
01:51 - you want to go and click on upload
01:53 - sprite
01:54 - and you want to start just uploading
01:56 - them on your scratch
01:59 - so as soon as i upload the flower it
02:01 - will now appear
02:02 - over here so i have already gone and
02:05 - uploaded all four of my strikes down
02:08 - here
02:08 - so i have my flower my letter my
02:11 - envelope and my greeting card
02:13 - now the first thing you want to straight
02:14 - away do is start resizing them
02:16 - in the beginning so our greeting card
02:18 - we're going to change it the size to
02:20 - 70 75 maybe
02:24 - the envelope let's make it um 40 let's
02:27 - make it 40.
02:28 - the letter will be the same size we're
02:30 - just going to center it out for now
02:32 - and the flower we can't really see it
02:34 - but let's change the size of the flower
02:36 - to 20. and then
02:40 - with uploading all of these all of these
02:43 - sprites in this
02:44 - into your scratch you will also notice
02:46 - that in the files that you have
02:47 - downloaded
02:48 - if you're making an animation of course
02:50 - that the greeting card
02:51 - is has includes a bunch of costumes so
02:54 - you want to also go ahead and upload
02:56 - those costumes by going into the costume
02:58 - section
02:59 - of the greeting card and click on upload
03:02 - and
03:02 - upload all the costumes in the order of
03:05 - the animation
03:06 - and once you do so you'll notice that
03:08 - you have all these costumes
03:10 - frame by frame which is ready for
03:12 - animating
03:14 - so go ahead and do that and we will
03:15 - start coding
03:17 - this section also if you like this video
03:20 - so far
03:20 - don't forget to subscribe to our channel
03:22 - and like this video
03:24 - because there's more stuff to be coming
03:26 - in the future as well
03:27 - alright so now that we have all four of
03:29 - our sprites you have your costumes all
03:32 - in we have them all sized up and ready
03:35 - to be coded
03:36 - let's start coding with our greeting
03:38 - card sprite
03:39 - so in our greeting card sprites we want
03:41 - it to first
03:42 - be on clicked we want it to show up
03:45 - now let's just remove this letter out of
03:47 - the way for now
03:48 - so that we can see our greeting card in
03:51 - the front
03:52 - okay that's better now we're going to
03:54 - add an event called when flag clicked
03:57 - and we want the starting costume to be
03:59 - the costume number one
04:01 - so you remember how we have different
04:03 - costumes for our
04:05 - greeting card so we wanted to start with
04:07 - costume number one when we first click
04:09 - on the flag
04:10 - so we're gonna go into the looks section
04:13 - and we're going to click on drag the
04:15 - switch costume to
04:17 - our first costume and we're also going
04:20 - to center it
04:22 - down so to make any object in the center
04:25 - you need
04:25 - remember the xy coordinates is always 0
04:28 - 0
04:29 - so we can just make this 0 0 and when i
04:31 - click the flag it will now be
04:34 - in the center we also want it to show
04:38 - in the beginning because we at some
04:40 - point we're gonna hide it down
04:42 - so we want it to show when we click on
04:43 - the flag next what we're gonna do
04:46 - so you see where it says press to open
04:47 - that means we're asking
04:49 - whoever is using it to press on the
04:52 - sprite
04:52 - so that means we're gonna click on our
04:54 - events and search for
04:56 - when sprite clicked right over here
05:00 - and what we want actually to happen when
05:02 - the sprite is clicked we want our
05:03 - animation to run through
05:05 - so in our costumes depending on how many
05:07 - costumes you have
05:09 - you want to see what's your ending
05:10 - number so my costumes over here
05:13 - ends at 11. that means we want it to
05:16 - change costumes
05:17 - 10 times until it reaches that 11 frame
05:20 - so we're gonna get a repeat 10
05:24 - exactly the number i need you don't need
05:27 - to change it if you
05:28 - if you have more than 11 costumes or
05:31 - more than you know
05:32 - 12 or 13 you want to change it to
05:35 - the whatever number is before the final
05:37 - number so for example
05:39 - if your costumes is at 14 you want to
05:42 - make sure the repeat is 13.
05:44 - so my costumes at 11 so i'm going to
05:47 - leave it at 10 over here
05:49 - okay then i'm gonna go to my looks tab
05:53 - and grab my next costume which is gonna
05:56 - switch that
05:57 - into the next costume and before we
06:00 - switch into the next costume let's also
06:02 - add a weight
06:03 - so that we can see that transition
06:05 - happening
06:08 - let's make that wait 0.5 seconds you
06:10 - know
06:11 - nice and small not too slow not too fast
06:14 - just good enough to
06:15 - show that transition so far so good
06:18 - let's look at the flag and
06:22 - click on it to see what happens
06:25 - so now it's in the center now i can
06:27 - click on the sprite
06:29 - and you'll see that we have a nice
06:31 - animation playing not too slow
06:34 - and then it goes towards the end and
06:35 - when i click on the flag
06:37 - it will go back to its starting place
06:40 - great so don't worry about all these
06:41 - rest of these sprites around right now
06:43 - we're gonna make sure they're also not
06:45 - messing around um
06:46 - and tidy up the entire space when we
06:47 - start going into those codes
06:49 - now to finish up our greeting card what
06:52 - we want to also do
06:53 - is when the greeting card is fully open
06:55 - we want to send a broadcast message to
06:57 - our
06:58 - envelope to our message that is fully
07:01 - open and we want it to pop up
07:03 - so what we're going to do is we're going
07:05 - to go in our control
07:07 - um events actually we're going to go in
07:09 - our events
07:10 - and we're going to do a broad when i
07:13 - receive
07:14 - over here and we're gonna make it
07:17 - new message and say it read
07:22 - letter let's just have no space over
07:23 - there or
07:25 - actually this is gonna be letter open
07:27 - not read letter sorry my bad
07:30 - but this is gonna when i receive
07:34 - letter open okay
07:38 - wrong button my back um so we're
07:40 - actually gonna just broadcast it down
07:43 - um after it's done looping that repeat
07:45 - over there
07:46 - so just gonna create this letter open
07:48 - that we just accidentally made in the
07:50 - broadcast
07:51 - when i received you just want to put it
07:53 - down over here
07:54 - and so whenever that loop is finished
07:56 - it's gonna send broadcast that letter
07:58 - open message over there
08:00 - to your envelope all right
08:04 - keeping up so far that's good now let's
08:07 - go move along to our
08:08 - envelope and we will now code inside
08:11 - to the start of animation we want it to
08:14 - first appear
08:15 - somewhere so we want to have a when
08:17 - clicked
08:20 - and you want to make the mo it go to a
08:23 - certain position
08:24 - so let's say we want it to go somewhere
08:28 - over here i think it's a little bit too
08:30 - big still so i'm going to just reduce
08:32 - the size to maybe
08:33 - 20. that's a good size all right again
08:37 - if it's too big or too small you can
08:38 - always just modify the size according to
08:40 - how you want it to be
08:42 - now um so that's the position i re i
08:45 - want it
08:45 - to pop up so now i'm going to put my go
08:48 - to
08:48 - x and y over here so that when when it's
08:51 - clicked it's going to show up in that
08:52 - position
08:53 - but first of all we want it to be hidden
08:56 - when the flag is clicked because we
08:57 - don't want it to be
08:58 - appear visible when the first
09:01 - when we first start the project we want
09:03 - it to be only popped up
09:05 - when we have the broadcast message from
09:07 - our
09:09 - greeting card which is that letter open
09:11 - so we're gonna get uh when i receive
09:13 - so this is where we're actually gonna do
09:15 - a when i receive over here
09:17 - we're gonna put that when i receive
09:18 - letter open that means whenever you get
09:20 - that message
09:21 - from the greeting card we want to first
09:23 - of all
09:24 - make sure that is in the front of the
09:26 - layer so we're going to put in
09:28 - our in our looks tab go to front layer
09:31 - and we're going to make it show
09:34 - so now it's going to make sure it pops
09:36 - up whenever it receives that message
09:38 - lastly what we want to do is we also
09:40 - want to trigger it so that when we click
09:42 - on it
09:42 - it opens and broadcasts the message for
09:45 - our letter
09:46 - we're setting it up for our letter code
09:48 - to there so we're gonna again
09:50 - do a when sprite clicked
09:54 - when this right clicked and we're gonna
09:57 - broadcast
09:58 - message and change it to a new message
10:02 - and this time it's gonna be read letter
10:07 - all right now we after we have clicked
10:11 - the sprite we don't want this envelope
10:12 - to be still there
10:14 - so what we're going to do is we're going
10:16 - to go in our looks
10:17 - and hide it now there's another feature
10:20 - in scratch where you can do is we can
10:22 - set the ghosting effect
10:24 - if you look over here there is a block
10:26 - called set color effect
10:28 - what will this do basically it will
10:29 - slowly hide it if we change it to
10:32 - ghost and make it to 100 so it will
10:35 - slowly fade away
10:37 - that envelope making it like a slow
10:39 - transition
10:40 - and it will just make it more natural in
10:43 - the transition
10:45 - all right now we want to just go back in
10:47 - our greeting card because we also want
10:49 - to
10:50 - hide our greeting card when the read
10:52 - letter is there
10:53 - received so we're going to go in our
10:55 - events
10:57 - when i receive read letter
11:01 - and we're gonna hide it as well
11:06 - great so we're done with our greeting
11:08 - card and we're done with our
11:10 - envelope so you can now move on to our
11:13 - letter and flowers
11:14 - so now that we're done with both of
11:15 - those we can now move this towards the
11:17 - center
11:18 - because we're going to be working in the
11:19 - letter now click on the letter and the
11:22 - costumes
11:22 - because right now we don't have any text
11:24 - inside and we want to make it
11:26 - personalize and you know
11:27 - start making some messages um what you
11:30 - want to actually tell your mother so you
11:31 - know you can write down
11:33 - a whole list of lines or whatever you
11:35 - want to write so use your
11:36 - use your text tool down here and start
11:39 - typing like you want to thank your
11:40 - mother thank you for
11:42 - everything write some words for your
11:44 - mother it's like
11:45 - you're thanking your mother for mother's
11:46 - day and you can write thank you for
11:48 - everything thank you for
11:49 - your hugs and love and then you know you
11:53 - can keep on writing you can use
11:54 - different colors so i'm done with this
11:56 - text over here maybe i can write
11:59 - a little view over here and then
12:03 - you can just change the color something
12:05 - else you know you can you can
12:07 - be creative with it just you know it's a
12:09 - message that you want to tell your
12:10 - mother so
12:12 - just use your own kind of what you want
12:14 - to tell her
12:15 - and you can even draw stuff so if you
12:16 - use your paintbrush and you know maybe
12:18 - you can draw like a heart
12:20 - you know you can fill that heart make it
12:22 - more you know
12:24 - more personal you know you can draw it's
12:26 - like a letter you know imagine you're
12:27 - writing a letter
12:28 - so that's how you can actually once
12:31 - you're done and you're happy with it
12:32 - you can put it down and we can actually
12:35 - start
12:35 - coding inside this letter
12:42 - okay so let's click on the code
12:45 - and we will start beginning our letter
12:47 - sprite now obviously
12:48 - the first thing we want it to be is
12:50 - hidden when we actually
12:52 - start the project so you want to go to
12:54 - events
12:55 - when flag clicked and you want to hide
12:58 - it in the beginning because we don't
13:00 - want it to be shown in the beginning
13:01 - right
13:01 - we want it to have like a slow process
13:04 - or you click the button and then it
13:05 - shows
13:06 - so we want it to be triggered from our
13:09 - envelope remember where we had a
13:10 - broadcast
13:11 - read letter so we want it to be whenever
13:14 - that read letter is
13:15 - sent we want it then to be shown so we
13:18 - will have go to our events
13:20 - when i receive read letter
13:24 - we will you know show it
13:30 - show right there and just to be safe we
13:33 - can also put a go to so that it goes to
13:35 - this position that we have it positioned
13:37 - right now
13:39 - all right so now that we have our
13:42 - letter envelope and greeting card the
13:44 - last thing we have remaining is just to
13:46 - add some
13:46 - you know sparkles some confetti some
13:49 - flowers just make it a little bit more
13:51 - you know some some decoration just to
13:53 - make it more
13:54 - interesting or you can say beautiful um
13:57 - so you know
13:58 - you can take um flowers you can take
14:01 - some confetti however you want you can
14:03 - choose your sprites
14:04 - for for this project i'm going to use
14:06 - the flowers that we had
14:07 - before and i'm going to first make sure
14:10 - that the flower sprite is hidden on the
14:12 - top screen so you can't really see the
14:14 - flower right now um
14:17 - let's just bring it up so that we can
14:19 - see it
14:21 - properly for our code
14:26 - yeah actually it's fine you don't really
14:27 - need to see it anyway um
14:30 - let's bring it here okay so you can see
14:33 - it's slightly there
14:34 - so you'll notice when i make changes to
14:36 - the code
14:38 - so i will put a when flag clicked
14:41 - and then i'll make it go to
14:46 - a random position because we want it to
14:48 - be coming up from running position
14:50 - i'm just going to change the values to
14:51 - make it 160 over here
14:54 - and we're going to use the pick random
14:57 - and just put in some values where we
15:00 - want it
15:01 - to be randomly showing up from
15:04 - and we want it in the beginning to be
15:06 - hidden
15:07 - because we don't want the flowers to be
15:08 - shown in the beginning then we will have
15:12 - a when i receive
15:16 - so when i receive read letter and we
15:19 - will create
15:20 - a forever loop over here because we want
15:23 - it to be
15:24 - forever and this is where we will start
15:27 - using
15:27 - clones of the flower so we will create a
15:29 - clone of the flowers that it's like a
15:31 - raining
15:32 - effect so let's go into our
15:35 - control and we will select create clone
15:37 - of myself
15:39 - and before we you know create a clone
15:41 - and multiply we want it to wait
15:43 - so we're going to put a wait one second
15:45 - over here
15:46 - and we're going to randomize the time
15:48 - the reason why we give it a random time
15:50 - is just to
15:50 - adjust the timing you know how they fall
15:53 - around
15:54 - so you can change it according to your
15:56 - liking doesn't have to be the values
15:57 - that i input
15:58 - down to
16:01 - all right so far
16:05 - so good now finally what we want to do
16:08 - is we need to instruct each clone to be
16:10 - falling down from the top of the screen
16:12 - in order to have a cluster of flower
16:13 - sprites at the bottom of the screen
16:15 - so what we'll do is we will add a
16:17 - conditional statement which will check
16:19 - if the position of the flowers is equal
16:22 - to minus 180 which is the lowest
16:24 - coordinate on the screen
16:25 - and as soon as it is in the lowest
16:27 - coordinate we want the clone to be
16:28 - deleted so that it can come back from
16:30 - the top
16:31 - so let's go ahead and do that part we
16:33 - will go ahead first
16:35 - and put in a when i start as clone from
16:37 - our control section
16:40 - then we will do a go to x and y again
16:43 - we're going to be randomizing
16:45 - the position of it so pick random
16:50 - randomize the values
16:58 - and finally we actually want it to show
17:01 - up as well because we haven't
17:03 - really showed the flowers yet we're just
17:04 - it's all working hidden right now
17:06 - and we want it to show when it starts to
17:09 - start as a clone
17:10 - then we want to put a forever loop
17:14 - and we want to just change the y
17:19 - start to change the y position
17:22 - because it's the up and down position
17:24 - then we put a weight
17:26 - before it clones so we put it 0.5
17:30 - seconds
17:31 - and this is where we will check the
17:32 - condition that if the position
17:34 - is you know below -180
17:37 - so we go to operator equals
17:41 - and we want to check the y position so
17:42 - we go to motion
17:44 - y position down here and make it
17:49 - minus 180
17:52 - and we want to delete this clone if it
17:55 - gets to that point
18:01 - all right so that is the code for this
18:04 - portion
18:05 - now you can take a look at this code
18:06 - over here now also one by one
18:08 - make sure that you you can look at all
18:11 - the codes that we have
18:13 - for all of the sprites but let's look at
18:15 - the project
18:16 - and see what we have so far let's click
18:18 - on the flag
18:19 - you know we have our greeting card
18:23 - press to open it's going to transition
18:25 - into that animation
18:29 - and then we have our letter that's
18:30 - popped up again you can modify the
18:32 - position to another place
18:34 - and then your letter will pop up and
18:38 - your flowers should start to clone
18:42 - all right so let's look at our code one
18:44 - by one just to make sure
18:46 - that you have the code correctly done
18:49 - so i can zoom in to all of them
18:52 - so you have in our greeting card we have
18:56 - these codes right here
19:03 - in our envelope
19:06 - we have these codes right here
19:10 - so at any point you can pause the video
19:12 - just so you can see that you have
19:13 - everything correct
19:15 - sounds good that's good all right
19:18 - and then next we have in our letter we
19:21 - have
19:21 - these codes right here
19:29 - and in the flower we have
19:32 - zoom out we have these codes
19:36 - right here
19:42 - okay so one thing we want to just change
19:46 - this to
19:49 - change y not set y
19:52 - because that that's why it's not really
19:55 - working because
19:56 - you want to want to set it
19:59 - right that was the only thing that was
20:00 - wrong but first of all
20:02 - it's all correct and you can now create
20:05 - your own special mother's day card and
20:07 - send it to your mother
20:09 - and you know you can design it custom
20:10 - made however you want it

20:15 - demonstration again of
20:16 - this project so i click open
20:24 - the letter and then we have the flowers
20:26 - following and your
20:27 - special message so that's all for today

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly tutorials on roblox minecraft scratch and many more today we'll be doing a special project with mother's day coming up we'll be creating a mother's day card on scratch so let's go ahead and take a look at the project alright so in this project we'll be creating a mother's day card which displays a custom message to your mother when the card is open in this project we'll be using costumes of sprites to make it more lively we'll be using custom costumes and we will also be using concept of clones and broadcast messages to pop up particular sprites at a given time let's take a look at the project first so when i click on the card it will open and it will display happy mother's day and there will be another spike that pops up which i can click on which says press letter to read and then it will display your custom message that you want to write for your mother so let's get started with this project alright so next we're going to create a new project on scratch now you can go to scratch by going to scratch.mit.edu the link will also be in the description down below then you will go to create and we'll be creating a new project now once we start a new project we're going to straight away delete this cap because we're not going to be using this in our project and we're going to be uploading our custom sprites now you can go ahead and download custom sprites um yourself as well but make sure they are transparent background so it'll be easier for you for this project i'm going to be using these an envelope a message a letter and some flowers all of those sprites will be available to you as well in the description down below so you can go ahead and download those and once you download those you want to go and click on upload sprite and you want to start just uploading them on your scratch so as soon as i upload the flower it will now appear over here so i have already gone and uploaded all four of my strikes down here so i have my flower my letter my envelope and my greeting card now the first thing you want to straight away do is start resizing them in the beginning so our greeting card we're going to change it the size to 70 75 maybe the envelope let's make it um 40 let's make it 40. the letter will be the same size we're just going to center it out for now and the flower we can't really see it but let's change the size of the flower to 20. and then with uploading all of these all of these sprites in this into your scratch you will also notice that in the files that you have downloaded if you're making an animation of course that the greeting card is has includes a bunch of costumes so you want to also go ahead and upload those costumes by going into the costume section of the greeting card and click on upload and upload all the costumes in the order of the animation and once you do so you'll notice that you have all these costumes frame by frame which is ready for animating so go ahead and do that and we will start coding this section also if you like this video so far don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like this video because there's more stuff to be coming in the future as well alright so now that we have all four of our sprites you have your costumes all in we have them all sized up and ready to be coded let's start coding with our greeting card sprite so in our greeting card sprites we want it to first be on clicked we want it to show up now let's just remove this letter out of the way for now so that we can see our greeting card in the front okay that's better now we're going to add an event called when flag clicked and we want the starting costume to be the costume number one so you remember how we have different costumes for our greeting card so we wanted to start with costume number one when we first click on the flag so we're gonna go into the looks section and we're going to click on drag the switch costume to our first costume and we're also going to center it down so to make any object in the center you need remember the xy coordinates is always 0 0 so we can just make this 0 0 and when i click the flag it will now be in the center we also want it to show in the beginning because we at some point we're gonna hide it down so we want it to show when we click on the flag next what we're gonna do so you see where it says press to open that means we're asking whoever is using it to press on the sprite so that means we're gonna click on our events and search for when sprite clicked right over here and what we want actually to happen when the sprite is clicked we want our animation to run through so in our costumes depending on how many costumes you have you want to see what's your ending number so my costumes over here ends at 11. that means we want it to change costumes 10 times until it reaches that 11 frame so we're gonna get a repeat 10 exactly the number i need you don't need to change it if you if you have more than 11 costumes or more than you know 12 or 13 you want to change it to the whatever number is before the final number so for example if your costumes is at 14 you want to make sure the repeat is 13. so my costumes at 11 so i'm going to leave it at 10 over here okay then i'm gonna go to my looks tab and grab my next costume which is gonna switch that into the next costume and before we switch into the next costume let's also add a weight so that we can see that transition happening let's make that wait 0.5 seconds you know nice and small not too slow not too fast just good enough to show that transition so far so good let's look at the flag and click on it to see what happens so now it's in the center now i can click on the sprite and you'll see that we have a nice animation playing not too slow and then it goes towards the end and when i click on the flag it will go back to its starting place great so don't worry about all these rest of these sprites around right now we're gonna make sure they're also not messing around um and tidy up the entire space when we start going into those codes now to finish up our greeting card what we want to also do is when the greeting card is fully open we want to send a broadcast message to our envelope to our message that is fully open and we want it to pop up so what we're going to do is we're going to go in our control um events actually we're going to go in our events and we're going to do a broad when i receive over here and we're gonna make it new message and say it read letter let's just have no space over there or actually this is gonna be letter open not read letter sorry my bad but this is gonna when i receive letter open okay wrong button my back um so we're actually gonna just broadcast it down um after it's done looping that repeat over there so just gonna create this letter open that we just accidentally made in the broadcast when i received you just want to put it down over here and so whenever that loop is finished it's gonna send broadcast that letter open message over there to your envelope all right keeping up so far that's good now let's go move along to our envelope and we will now code inside to the start of animation we want it to first appear somewhere so we want to have a when clicked and you want to make the mo it go to a certain position so let's say we want it to go somewhere over here i think it's a little bit too big still so i'm going to just reduce the size to maybe 20. that's a good size all right again if it's too big or too small you can always just modify the size according to how you want it to be now um so that's the position i re i want it to pop up so now i'm going to put my go to x and y over here so that when when it's clicked it's going to show up in that position but first of all we want it to be hidden when the flag is clicked because we don't want it to be appear visible when the first when we first start the project we want it to be only popped up when we have the broadcast message from our greeting card which is that letter open so we're gonna get uh when i receive so this is where we're actually gonna do a when i receive over here we're gonna put that when i receive letter open that means whenever you get that message from the greeting card we want to first of all make sure that is in the front of the layer so we're going to put in our in our looks tab go to front layer and we're going to make it show so now it's going to make sure it pops up whenever it receives that message lastly what we want to do is we also want to trigger it so that when we click on it it opens and broadcasts the message for our letter we're setting it up for our letter code to there so we're gonna again do a when sprite clicked when this right clicked and we're gonna broadcast message and change it to a new message and this time it's gonna be read letter all right now we after we have clicked the sprite we don't want this envelope to be still there so what we're going to do is we're going to go in our looks and hide it now there's another feature in scratch where you can do is we can set the ghosting effect if you look over here there is a block called set color effect what will this do basically it will slowly hide it if we change it to ghost and make it to 100 so it will slowly fade away that envelope making it like a slow transition and it will just make it more natural in the transition all right now we want to just go back in our greeting card because we also want to hide our greeting card when the read letter is there received so we're going to go in our events when i receive read letter and we're gonna hide it as well great so we're done with our greeting card and we're done with our envelope so you can now move on to our letter and flowers so now that we're done with both of those we can now move this towards the center because we're going to be working in the letter now click on the letter and the costumes because right now we don't have any text inside and we want to make it personalize and you know start making some messages um what you want to actually tell your mother so you know you can write down a whole list of lines or whatever you want to write so use your use your text tool down here and start typing like you want to thank your mother thank you for everything write some words for your mother it's like you're thanking your mother for mother's day and you can write thank you for everything thank you for your hugs and love and then you know you can keep on writing you can use different colors so i'm done with this text over here maybe i can write a little view over here and then you can just change the color something else you know you can you can be creative with it just you know it's a message that you want to tell your mother so just use your own kind of what you want to tell her and you can even draw stuff so if you use your paintbrush and you know maybe you can draw like a heart you know you can fill that heart make it more you know more personal you know you can draw it's like a letter you know imagine you're writing a letter so that's how you can actually once you're done and you're happy with it you can put it down and we can actually start coding inside this letter okay so let's click on the code and we will start beginning our letter sprite now obviously the first thing we want it to be is hidden when we actually start the project so you want to go to events when flag clicked and you want to hide it in the beginning because we don't want it to be shown in the beginning right we want it to have like a slow process or you click the button and then it shows so we want it to be triggered from our envelope remember where we had a broadcast read letter so we want it to be whenever that read letter is sent we want it then to be shown so we will have go to our events when i receive read letter we will you know show it show right there and just to be safe we can also put a go to so that it goes to this position that we have it positioned right now all right so now that we have our letter envelope and greeting card the last thing we have remaining is just to add some you know sparkles some confetti some flowers just make it a little bit more you know some some decoration just to make it more interesting or you can say beautiful um so you know you can take um flowers you can take some confetti however you want you can choose your sprites for for this project i'm going to use the flowers that we had before and i'm going to first make sure that the flower sprite is hidden on the top screen so you can't really see the flower right now um let's just bring it up so that we can see it properly for our code yeah actually it's fine you don't really need to see it anyway um let's bring it here okay so you can see it's slightly there so you'll notice when i make changes to the code so i will put a when flag clicked and then i'll make it go to a random position because we want it to be coming up from running position i'm just going to change the values to make it 160 over here and we're going to use the pick random and just put in some values where we want it to be randomly showing up from and we want it in the beginning to be hidden because we don't want the flowers to be shown in the beginning then we will have a when i receive so when i receive read letter and we will create a forever loop over here because we want it to be forever and this is where we will start using clones of the flower so we will create a clone of the flowers that it's like a raining effect so let's go into our control and we will select create clone of myself and before we you know create a clone and multiply we want it to wait so we're going to put a wait one second over here and we're going to randomize the time the reason why we give it a random time is just to adjust the timing you know how they fall around so you can change it according to your liking doesn't have to be the values that i input down to all right so far so good now finally what we want to do is we need to instruct each clone to be falling down from the top of the screen in order to have a cluster of flower sprites at the bottom of the screen so what we'll do is we will add a conditional statement which will check if the position of the flowers is equal to minus 180 which is the lowest coordinate on the screen and as soon as it is in the lowest coordinate we want the clone to be deleted so that it can come back from the top so let's go ahead and do that part we will go ahead first and put in a when i start as clone from our control section then we will do a go to x and y again we're going to be randomizing the position of it so pick random randomize the values and finally we actually want it to show up as well because we haven't really showed the flowers yet we're just it's all working hidden right now and we want it to show when it starts to start as a clone then we want to put a forever loop and we want to just change the y start to change the y position because it's the up and down position then we put a weight before it clones so we put it 0.5 seconds and this is where we will check the condition that if the position is you know below 180 so we go to operator equals and we want to check the y position so we go to motion y position down here and make it minus 180 and we want to delete this clone if it gets to that point all right so that is the code for this portion now you can take a look at this code over here now also one by one make sure that you you can look at all the codes that we have for all of the sprites but let's look at the project and see what we have so far let's click on the flag you know we have our greeting card press to open it's going to transition into that animation and then we have our letter that's popped up again you can modify the position to another place and then your letter will pop up and your flowers should start to clone all right so let's look at our code one by one just to make sure that you have the code correctly done so i can zoom in to all of them so you have in our greeting card we have these codes right here in our envelope we have these codes right here so at any point you can pause the video just so you can see that you have everything correct sounds good that's good all right and then next we have in our letter we have these codes right here and in the flower we have zoom out we have these codes right here okay so one thing we want to just change this to change y not set y because that that's why it's not really working because you want to want to set it right that was the only thing that was wrong but first of all it's all correct and you can now create your own special mother's day card and send it to your mother and you know you can design it custom made however you want it all right so let's just look at the demonstration again of this project so i click open the letter and then we have the flowers following and your special message so that's all for today hope you liked the video don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out these two other videos here while you're waiting for the next video thank you have a nice day bye
