00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share
00:03 - beginner-friendly tutorials on minecraft
00:05 - roblox
00:06 - scratch web programming and many more
00:09 - today we're going to be learning how to
00:11 - create a drum kit
00:12 - in scratch so let's get started let's
00:15 - take a look at this project first before
00:17 - we get started
00:18 - and we will see how it works
00:22 - so as you can see any of the drum parts
00:24 - is like
00:25 - you're a certain town of close to that
00:32 - [Music]
00:33 - all right great let's get started on how
00:35 - to make this project
00:37 - okay so first of all we will start by
00:38 - creating an empty
00:40 - scratch project and then we will delete
00:43 - our cat sprite
00:45 - first mode
00:51 - okay next what we're going to do is
00:53 - we're going to search for a drum kit
00:55 - image online
00:56 - now i've already found one and
00:57 - downloaded it on my computer
01:00 - what you want to do is also find one for
01:01 - yourself and you can go to
01:05 - backdrops and then upload that drum kit
01:08 - image
01:09 - onto your project
01:18 - so a good example of finding a drum kit
01:20 - on while you're searching for it could
01:22 - be
01:23 - searching drum kit game view and you can
01:25 - get something which is like this
01:27 - as well now this is pretty decent we
01:28 - have a proper drum set
01:30 - you can you know then we can map out all
01:32 - of this sounds in over here
01:35 - great next what we're going to do is
01:37 - we're going to start creating
01:39 - hit boxes now hit boxes in games are
01:42 - basically invisible spaces
01:44 - that are used to detect something when
01:46 - something gets hit
01:48 - now when we're using these kind of
01:49 - hitboxes it allows you to create a sound
01:52 - in the game
01:53 - so what we're going to do uh we're going
01:55 - to create a sprite with the paint tool
01:58 - and we're going to start creating these
02:01 - hit boxes by creating
02:03 - an oval i'm just going to change this
02:05 - color to black
02:08 - okay and i want to move this hit box
02:14 - as close and make it as
02:18 - distinct to the drum parts as possible
02:22 - so for example if i have this tom over
02:24 - here
02:26 - nice so this looks pretty decent and
02:30 - good enough for it to be the hitbox of
02:32 - this part next you want to do this for
02:34 - all of the parts um the remaining parts
02:37 - of the drum
02:37 - but before that what we can also do to
02:39 - make it an easier process
02:41 - is we can add sounds in it and we can
02:43 - just
02:44 - duplicate the parts and adjust it
02:46 - according to
02:47 - the part so let's say for example for
02:50 - over here
02:50 - i'm going to delete this pop sound and
02:53 - i'm going to look for
02:54 - the percussion sounds
02:58 - now since we're working with a tom over
03:00 - here let's say oh i want to get this
03:04 - sound over here
03:08 - and we can just make it a little bit
03:10 - softer
03:16 - sounds a little bit like
03:19 - a tom next what we can do
03:22 - is we can right click over here and
03:25 - duplicate this
03:27 - now you can just readjust the position
03:29 - of it
03:31 - according to where you want the hitbox
03:34 - to be
03:40 - again i'm gonna just resize it a little
03:43 - bit just because it looks a little bit
03:44 - different
03:46 - and now since this is a different
03:49 - hitbox i'm going to make this sound a
03:51 - little bit different
03:53 - as well i'm going to name this tom 2 and
03:55 - maybe make this
03:57 - a little bit more soft
04:01 - lower okay so now this sounds a little
04:05 - bit
04:05 - deeper as well so we have two sounds
04:09 - one and this one is a little bit higher
04:13 - now i'm going to continue with
04:14 - duplicating for the rest of the parts as
04:16 - well
04:17 - so just duplicate and then go back to
04:20 - costumes
04:23 - and i'm going to move this down here
04:28 - now you want to adjust it according to
04:31 - the part
04:31 - size so just keep on doing that
04:35 - until you have
04:38 - the right size adjustments
04:42 - it can be a little bit tricky for some
04:44 - some parts but
04:47 - you want to make it as
04:51 - accurate as possible doesn't have to be
04:54 - super accurate but as long as you can
04:56 - create like a hitbox that the player
04:59 - can touch
05:04 - all right i think i'm happy with this
05:08 - one
05:10 - um and then i'm just going to change the
05:11 - sound over here
05:13 - let's say i'm going to add a snary sound
05:15 - over there
05:16 - go back to my percussion let's look for
05:19 - snares
05:21 - snare drum and i'm just gonna add that
05:26 - that's gonna be the sound for this one
05:29 - and i'm just gonna continue onwards by
05:32 - duplicating
05:35 - and moving it to the next place
05:40 - so our kick drum over here needs to be
05:43 - adjusted as well
05:51 - again take your time with this it can be
05:54 - a time consuming process but it is
05:58 - um pretty simple to do once you get the
06:00 - hold of it
06:02 - right so now i'm going to put the sound
06:04 - of the kick over here
06:06 - kick drum
06:10 - all right
06:15 - okay that's good
06:18 - back to duplicating this
06:26 - okay um and then
06:30 - this one would also be
06:34 - let's just call let's just have this a
06:36 - snare drum sound
06:38 - okay now we only have the hats remaining
06:40 - so let's just finish up with those
06:42 - as well
06:53 - all right let me just find the sound for
07:00 - it
07:09 - okay let's have this symbol crash
07:13 - over here and then let me just duplicate
07:17 - this
07:29 - it's a little bit different sound so
07:31 - that looks different
07:33 - i'm just going to adjust this one again
07:36 - just a little bit okay
07:40 - now finally we just have the
07:44 - head just duplicate that last one
07:59 - and just make this sound
08:03 - different as well
08:07 - yeah make it like a symbol another crash
08:15 - okay so now that we have all of our
08:18 - hitboxes done
08:19 - we will now move on to the coding of
08:21 - this
08:22 - now the coding process of this will be
08:24 - we will code in one hitbox
08:26 - and then the same code will be
08:28 - duplicated in all of the hit boxes so it
08:30 - should be pretty simple
08:32 - let's first start with one of the hit
08:34 - boxes let's say i'm starting with this
08:37 - sprite one over here i'm going to start
08:40 - with a when
08:40 - flag clicked now first of all we want it
08:44 - to be going
08:45 - in the front of the layer so you will
08:47 - get to get a
08:48 - go to front layer and we want it to
08:52 - show now there's another thing that we
08:55 - want it's to be
08:56 - happening is we don't want the hitboxes
08:58 - to be seen while we're playing the game
09:00 - so we're going to be using an effect
09:01 - called the ghosting effect
09:03 - set ghost effect and we're going to set
09:05 - it to a hundred percent
09:08 - what this will do is basically it will
09:10 - make it transparent
09:12 - so that when we're actually running the
09:15 - project the hitboxes
09:16 - are not seen then what we want to do
09:20 - is basically get a forever loop since we
09:23 - want this to be running
09:24 - forever throughout the game we will
09:28 - put it in
09:31 - and we need to check whether if
09:34 - the mouse is touching the hitbox or not
09:37 - and the way that we do that
09:38 - is we get a if condition so we're going
09:40 - to get a if
09:41 - blank then there's a couple of blocks
09:44 - that we also need is a blank
09:46 - and blank which is checking two
09:47 - conditions together so we're to go in
09:49 - our operator
09:50 - get our blank and blank
09:54 - and we want to check our mouse down
09:59 - and touching mouse pointer so these are
10:02 - the three blocks that we need
10:04 - to actually test if we are actually
10:07 - hitting that hitbox so after assembling
10:09 - these um
10:11 - blocked together we want to put them
10:12 - inside the forever
10:14 - loop so let's start with putting this
10:19 - inside the if condition and we're
10:21 - checking that if the mouse is down
10:23 - and if it's touching the mouse pointer
10:27 - the hitbox
10:29 - then we want something to happen so
10:30 - before we want it to play any sound
10:33 - we want it to wait so we're gonna get a
10:36 - weight
10:37 - from the control section first
10:42 - right here and we're gonna get a not
10:48 - blank and put it over here the reason
10:51 - we're doing is we're just gonna check
10:52 - if it's not actually a mouse but that's
10:55 - it's not
10:56 - down so that it's gonna then play the
10:58 - sound
10:59 - after the mouse is not down
11:02 - so we're gonna go get that mouse down
11:05 - again
11:09 - and then finally play that sound that we
11:12 - have
11:13 - assigned for this hitbox so we go to
11:16 - sound
11:17 - and start sound
11:21 - tom drum so let's try
11:25 - for specifically this if this works
11:29 - and it does so that's great so now all
11:32 - we have to do
11:33 - is pretty simple we're just going to
11:34 - copy
11:38 - and paste it into all of these
11:42 - hit boxes
11:51 - so i'm just command c and command v
11:54 - or control c or control v and copying
11:57 - and pasting all this code
11:59 - into the rest of the hitboxes now you
12:01 - want to make sure
12:03 - that when you're duplicating or
12:06 - pasting them into all these hitboxes you
12:09 - change the sound
12:10 - according to what did you have
12:13 - assigned for that particular hitbox
12:17 - so i had tom two over here for this one
12:21 - we had a snare drum
12:24 - this one had a kick
12:28 - that was also a snare we had
12:32 - symbol crash
12:36 - and another symbol crash
12:40 - and a symbol so now let's take a look at
12:42 - the final
12:44 - project you can see
12:52 - you have all the hitboxes working and
12:56 - always go back and turn this down
12:57 - according to how you want it to be
13:03 - that's good so now you can play around
13:05 - with different sounds it just doesn't
13:06 - have to be like a drum kit you can
13:08 - use your own custom sound as well and
13:10 - play around with it as much as you want
13:13 - well so that's our finished project
13:17 - you can also use different images
13:20 - it doesn't have to be this image um
13:24 - you can use a bongo you can use a
13:26 - keyboard
13:27 - using these hit boxes you can create a
13:29 - lot of different kind of you know
13:31 - projects now
13:32 - you can create like a keyboard and have
13:34 - different keys
13:35 - of those hitboxes playing different
13:37 - instrument sounds
13:38 - as well so the ideas you can come up
13:41 - with are limitless
13:42 - using these hit boxes so that's all for
13:45 - today hope you liked the video don't

13:49 - also check out these two other videos
13:51 - here while you're waiting for the next

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly tutorials on minecraft roblox scratch web programming and many more today we're going to be learning how to create a drum kit in scratch so let's get started let's take a look at this project first before we get started and we will see how it works so as you can see any of the drum parts is like you're a certain town of close to that all right great let's get started on how to make this project okay so first of all we will start by creating an empty scratch project and then we will delete our cat sprite first mode okay next what we're going to do is we're going to search for a drum kit image online now i've already found one and downloaded it on my computer what you want to do is also find one for yourself and you can go to backdrops and then upload that drum kit image onto your project so a good example of finding a drum kit on while you're searching for it could be searching drum kit game view and you can get something which is like this as well now this is pretty decent we have a proper drum set you can you know then we can map out all of this sounds in over here great next what we're going to do is we're going to start creating hit boxes now hit boxes in games are basically invisible spaces that are used to detect something when something gets hit now when we're using these kind of hitboxes it allows you to create a sound in the game so what we're going to do uh we're going to create a sprite with the paint tool and we're going to start creating these hit boxes by creating an oval i'm just going to change this color to black okay and i want to move this hit box as close and make it as distinct to the drum parts as possible so for example if i have this tom over here nice so this looks pretty decent and good enough for it to be the hitbox of this part next you want to do this for all of the parts um the remaining parts of the drum but before that what we can also do to make it an easier process is we can add sounds in it and we can just duplicate the parts and adjust it according to the part so let's say for example for over here i'm going to delete this pop sound and i'm going to look for the percussion sounds now since we're working with a tom over here let's say oh i want to get this sound over here and we can just make it a little bit softer sounds a little bit like a tom next what we can do is we can right click over here and duplicate this now you can just readjust the position of it according to where you want the hitbox to be again i'm gonna just resize it a little bit just because it looks a little bit different and now since this is a different hitbox i'm going to make this sound a little bit different as well i'm going to name this tom 2 and maybe make this a little bit more soft lower okay so now this sounds a little bit deeper as well so we have two sounds one and this one is a little bit higher now i'm going to continue with duplicating for the rest of the parts as well so just duplicate and then go back to costumes and i'm going to move this down here now you want to adjust it according to the part size so just keep on doing that until you have the right size adjustments it can be a little bit tricky for some some parts but you want to make it as accurate as possible doesn't have to be super accurate but as long as you can create like a hitbox that the player can touch all right i think i'm happy with this one um and then i'm just going to change the sound over here let's say i'm going to add a snary sound over there go back to my percussion let's look for snares snare drum and i'm just gonna add that that's gonna be the sound for this one and i'm just gonna continue onwards by duplicating and moving it to the next place so our kick drum over here needs to be adjusted as well again take your time with this it can be a time consuming process but it is um pretty simple to do once you get the hold of it right so now i'm going to put the sound of the kick over here kick drum all right okay that's good back to duplicating this okay um and then this one would also be let's just call let's just have this a snare drum sound okay now we only have the hats remaining so let's just finish up with those as well all right let me just find the sound for it okay let's have this symbol crash over here and then let me just duplicate this it's a little bit different sound so that looks different i'm just going to adjust this one again just a little bit okay now finally we just have the head just duplicate that last one and just make this sound different as well yeah make it like a symbol another crash okay so now that we have all of our hitboxes done we will now move on to the coding of this now the coding process of this will be we will code in one hitbox and then the same code will be duplicated in all of the hit boxes so it should be pretty simple let's first start with one of the hit boxes let's say i'm starting with this sprite one over here i'm going to start with a when flag clicked now first of all we want it to be going in the front of the layer so you will get to get a go to front layer and we

it's not down so that it's gonna then play the sound after the mouse is not down so we're gonna go get that mouse down again and then finally play that sound that we have assigned for this hitbox so we go to sound and start sound tom drum so let's try for specifically this if this works and it does so that's great so now all we have to do is pretty simple we're just going to copy and paste it into all of these hit boxes so i'm just command c and command v or control c or control v and copying and pasting all this code into the rest of the hitboxes now you want to make sure that when you're duplicating or pasting them into all these hitboxes you change the sound according to what did you have assigned for that particular hitbox so i had tom two over here for this one we had a snare drum this one had a kick that was also a snare we had symbol crash and another symbol crash and a symbol so now let's take a look at the final project you can see you have all the hitboxes working and always go back and turn this down according to how you want it to be that's good so now you can play around with different sounds it just doesn't have to be like a drum kit you can use your own custom sound as well and play around with it as much as you want well so that's our finished project you can also use different images it doesn't have to be this image um you can use a bongo you can use a keyboard using these hit boxes you can create a lot of different kind of you know projects now you can create like a keyboard and have different keys of those hitboxes playing different instrument sounds as well so the ideas you can come up with are limitless using these hit boxes so that's all for today hope you liked the video don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out these two other videos here while you're waiting for the next video thank you have a nice day bye
