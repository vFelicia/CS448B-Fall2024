00:00 - hi everyone welcome back to first code
00:02 - academy channel
00:03 - and in today's project we'll continue in
00:05 - our series of how to make a roblox city
00:08 - i hope you enjoy it
00:09 - on this fourth part of our project we'll
00:11 - be learning how to
00:13 - implement vehicles and i'll be giving
00:15 - you some suggestions of what type of
00:16 - vehicles
00:17 - to add in your project to make the city
00:19 - look more lively
00:21 - and let's get going with the project so
00:22 - after last week
00:24 - i added a couple roads so we can test
00:27 - our vehicles
00:28 - and see which are the best options for
00:30 - our city
00:31 - beside the bridge i added some roads
00:33 - that loop around
00:35 - and parking lots that's we're gonna put
00:38 - all the vehicles and i'm gonna test it
00:39 - one by one to see how they work
00:41 - i i still have this part over here since
00:43 - i added the
00:45 - other elements i can push it to a little
00:47 - bit behind so it doesn't interfere
00:49 - with our main city so
00:52 - as you can see i moved this pawn over
00:54 - here since i don't really need it over
00:55 - there
00:56 - since i'm putting all the vehicles in
00:57 - the parking lot
00:59 - and what type of cars can i add on let's
01:02 - start with a couple of cars
01:03 - you can just type a car let's see i like
01:07 - the cool fast one so i'm gonna put a
01:09 - tesla
01:11 - well just because it's a noble one right
01:16 - and i'm gonna leave them usually at the
01:18 - normal size and
01:19 - unless they're like too big or too small
01:21 - but usually it's not the case
01:24 - all right i'm gonna add a lamborghini
01:30 - they take a little bit to load because
01:32 - they have a lot of scripts inside
01:54 - this looks so tiny in comparison to the
01:57 - normal
01:58 - like monster truck it's scary
02:01 - imagine you crashed with this one you
02:04 - crush these two together
02:06 - then we we kind of know which one won't
02:09 - survive
02:11 - uh i'm curious about this future car i'm
02:13 - gonna put this as well
02:15 - it's also quite big i think barely fits
02:18 - parking space
02:19 - okay let's start with these five i'm
02:22 - gonna try out each one of them and then
02:24 - we're gonna put more suggestions of
02:25 - other types of vehicles you can put
02:28 - besides normal cars you can see like for
02:30 - example this car
02:32 - this in spare
02:36 - uh they have a dry seed body
02:39 - for example master and it's just like
02:41 - the body part the wheels also have like
02:44 - front left parts
02:47 - and the scripts you'll have to like dig
02:49 - super inside i'm not really sure where
02:51 - they put all the scripts
02:58 - now for example the seat has a script
03:00 - which is pretty big
03:03 - i believe it's just to move uh to adjust
03:07 - the character
03:08 - inside of the of the seat so these
03:10 - scripts
03:11 - are not really for moving the car more
03:13 - like for the character to actually look
03:15 - as if it's sitting down inside of the
03:17 - car now this one is the actual big
03:20 - script
03:20 - right it even has a rhythmic explaining
03:23 - what the car
03:24 - does it's pretty huge
03:28 - and initialize and then you have all of
03:31 - the codes inside of this board
03:32 - right so we're not going to touch them
03:35 - it's just to
03:36 - let you know that cars don't move just
03:38 - because like you can draw a car
03:40 - or build a car with parts and everything
03:43 - but you still need the coating
03:44 - otherwise the car is never going to move
03:49 - and especially these are these are
03:50 - drivable cars there's a difference
03:52 - between cars like you can make a car
03:54 - that moves itself
03:56 - and a car you can actually drive so
03:58 - let's see
04:00 - no i want the driver's seat
04:20 - okay i assume this was for breaking but
04:24 - i pressed the space in accent normally
04:26 - in racing games
04:27 - i don't want to walk all the way back
04:29 - normally in racing games the break is to
04:31 - do like heartbreak but apparently i just
04:36 - sent it flying away which is kind of
04:39 - fortunate for the car
04:41 - i'm going to move it a little bit off
04:43 - maybe that's the problem
04:55 - oh it's not the monster truck
04:58 - if it doesn't kill me first
05:01 - all right even this one works okay
05:04 - uh if you see this one is massive and
05:06 - pretty hard to control
05:09 - i believe it should have the same
05:10 - controls right
05:13 - my handbrake with pin okay now i know
05:14 - how to do it
05:16 - right barely fits the streets but i
05:22 - think
05:31 - so goodbye all right i guess that one is
05:34 - a governor
05:36 - let's start with the police one maybe
05:37 - those are easier to control
05:44 - oh no it's just a police car okay i
05:47 - don't want the police car anymore
05:48 - all right so it's part of the or the
05:51 - process as well maybe
05:53 - something is happening with police car
05:55 - and i cannot try the other ones either
05:58 - and what all type of vehicles do we have
06:00 - uh
06:01 - or should we include in the city well if
06:04 - you put a school you should create
06:06 - school bus right
06:07 - or any method of transportation actually
06:09 - uh
06:10 - like for the city boost proper maybe
06:15 - let's try with this this one had a lot
06:18 - of uploads
06:19 - probably work put it here
06:23 - in the parking lot
06:26 - i'm not sure how it works but
06:29 - i mean if you can park it in then
06:31 - probably can work it out
06:33 - let's put it yeah all the way here
06:38 - let's see if i can i'm good enough of a
06:39 - driver to take it out of this parking
06:41 - lot i'm gonna double
06:42 - the future car uh what are type of
06:45 - vehicles if you have a construction site
06:46 - you might want some
06:48 - construction vehicles
06:53 - crane now crane is not really a vehicle
06:58 - this one for example
07:09 - and you can even include some
07:14 - motorcycles
07:18 - maybe people didn't really like it you
07:20 - you should also look at the boats if you
07:22 - want to decide on the vehicle
07:23 - maybe that's something i didn't do
07:24 - before
07:27 - maybe the ones i just deleted are the
07:29 - ones below both
07:31 - who knows um i'll check the footage
07:34 - again to see
07:36 - if that was the case or not oh yeah try
07:39 - to populate your city
07:41 - i'm putting them right now in the
07:43 - parking lot for next class i'm gonna put
07:45 - them in different places
07:57 - whoa this is super fun
08:14 - you're very hard to control or i'm very
08:16 - bad at controlling it
08:17 - i'm not really sure we'll try the r2
08:21 - and that's how we're going to wrap it up
08:32 - i'm gonna just try the crane see if this
08:34 - one is actually any better
08:41 - it doesn't actually have any instruction
08:42 - like the box
08:44 - let me just decoration in any case
08:48 - i still have to i've got my two cars at
08:50 - work
08:52 - my monster truck and my lamborghini then
08:54 - i never knew i was gonna stick
08:57 - like in the motor stop better than the
08:58 - other one
09:02 - but yeah
09:05 - just make sure to be careful when you
09:06 - drive this thing
09:09 - otherwise you'll get the wheel to stop
09:11 - like i did in the first one
09:19 - how did it turn around i'm not really
09:21 - sure
09:27 - very resilient okay i'm gonna find more
09:29 - vehicles and then we're gonna
09:31 - wrap it up for the next video and that's
09:34 - gonna be it for today
09:35 - i hope you enjoyed this project don't
09:37 - forget to like and subscribe
09:38 - and we'll see you on the final part
09:41 - goodbye
