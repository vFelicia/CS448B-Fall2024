00:00 - everyone so welcome to this tutorial in
00:02 - today's tutorial what we're going to
00:04 - make
00:04 - is a sword in minecraft and we're going
00:07 - to be using
00:08 - a program called m creator so in this
00:10 - tutorial
00:11 - you learn how to design sword you learn
00:14 - how to
00:15 - mod it with the software and then you'll
00:18 - learn how to use this sword
00:19 - in minecraft so let's begin what i have
00:23 - open
00:23 - is m creator and the first thing that
00:26 - we're going to make
00:27 - is a weapon so how do we design this
00:30 - we first click on the plus over here and
00:33 - once you click over here
00:35 - you can go all the way to tool
00:38 - click on that and then here you can
00:41 - write in the
00:42 - name of the tool so you can just call it
00:45 - say my custom weapon
00:48 - and click create youtube so
00:52 - over here we have tool texture and then
00:54 - we have make item globe
00:56 - so this part here is if you want to
01:00 - add in a picture of your design or
01:03 - if you would like to draw your design so
01:05 - what we're going to do is we can use the
01:07 - inbuilt texture creator and make one
01:10 - ourselves
01:10 - so we can go here and then we can just
01:14 - leave it at transparency
01:16 - leave the size at 16 and 16 for height
01:18 - and width
01:19 - and we can click on create so once we're
01:22 - here
01:23 - we can draw our two so what we can do
01:27 - first
01:27 - is we can change the shape if we like
01:29 - you can use a circle a ring or square
01:32 - so generally when drawing a square is
01:34 - better
01:35 - as it's easier to place and then here we
01:38 - can use the
01:39 - drawing tool and here you have the
01:42 - option of
01:43 - colors so you can pick any color you
01:45 - like so i'm just going to pick
01:47 - this color click ok and to draw the
01:50 - sword
01:51 - i'm just going to draw it from this way
01:54 - so i'll just start from here
01:55 - like this
02:00 - here i'm drawing the sword and i'm
02:02 - trying to make a design
02:03 - so i'm drawing it from bottom to top and
02:06 - then i'm adding the handles
02:08 - you can click save this texture and then
02:11 - here it will ask us what type of texture
02:13 - it is block item or other so
02:15 - we're just going to click on item
02:18 - and i'll just call this again my custom
02:24 - okay all right so invalid text
02:27 - so when that happens it means you click
02:29 - back on save
02:30 - click on item and then make it lower
02:32 - case right my
02:34 - custom so make sure your
02:37 - name is all in lowercase not uppercasing
02:40 - or not one is uppercase and one is
02:42 - lowercase
02:43 - okay so once or click that you've saved
02:46 - it
02:47 - then we can go back here click on this
02:50 - click on this and click select
02:52 - so this is the sword that i made
02:55 - so now the next thing i have to do is i
02:58 - can click on
02:59 - save mod element right so
03:03 - this is my weapon over here and then i
03:05 - can click it back on it and see if
03:07 - anything
03:08 - i want to change i don't want to put
03:09 - anything special and then here we leave
03:11 - it
03:12 - normal make item glow if you want to
03:15 - enable your item to glow you can do that
03:18 - then next we can click on properties so
03:21 - here we can check
03:24 - what do we want it to be used for since
03:26 - we're making it a weapon
03:28 - and click on combat and then the type we
03:31 - can pick on sword
03:33 - so over here we can change the attack
03:37 - speed to make it a bit higher
03:39 - if we put it 1.5 and then the
03:42 - damage we can change this to a bit
03:45 - higher
03:47 - maybe and then here
03:51 - blocks affected repair items we can
03:54 - leave that alone
03:56 - and then here does it stay in the
03:57 - crafting part we can leave this
04:00 - and then here it says damage item make
04:02 - sure to enable
04:04 - we can click on this and then next we
04:06 - can click on triggers
04:08 - so here if you wanted to do something
04:10 - you can start our
04:12 - mod that we've made so over here we can
04:15 - click on this
04:16 - play icon so once we click on this
04:20 - make sure it's green and then it'll
04:22 - start loading and then what will happen
04:24 - is minecraft will open
04:25 - so once this happens minecraft should
04:27 - start loading on your computer
04:31 - so this is a built-in minecraft with m
04:33 - creator
04:37 - here we click on multiplayer create a
04:40 - new
04:42 - and then you can make this creative
04:46 - then here you can just name this m
04:48 - creator
04:50 - world create new world
04:54 - once that happens your world will start
04:56 - loading
05:00 - so once our minecraft world is loaded

05:07 - we can type in the
05:08 - item so left in my and we have here the
05:11 - custom weapon that we made
05:18 - so if you're unable to break a block you
05:21 - can just put slash

05:40 - mod and you can click save
05:43 - and then quit it and then it's saved
