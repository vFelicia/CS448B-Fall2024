00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to the
00:01 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner-friendly
00:05 - tutorials on minecraft
00:07 - roblox scratch web programming and many
00:10 - more
00:10 - for today's project i'll be designing a
00:12 - game using minecraft redstone
00:15 - using minecraft redstone will allow us
00:17 - to design circuits
00:18 - and many different contractions that
00:20 - activate automatically
00:23 - this video is the second part of the
00:25 - obstacle course
00:26 - so let's get started in this second half
00:29 - of the project
00:30 - we'll design two more traps the first
00:32 - trap consists
00:34 - of a parkour map with a flying arrow
00:37 - obstacle here this rain of arrows
00:41 - uh when the liver is turned on we'll
00:44 - start firing arrows
00:46 - and the objective of the game is to have
00:48 - the user jump across without getting hit
00:50 - by the arrows
00:50 - the second obstacle uh we provide a
00:53 - ladder for the use to climb up
00:57 - and once the user has climbed up um
01:00 - you can see that there's a slime block
01:01 - six blocks away
01:03 - and the objective is to jump and hit the
01:05 - slab block and
01:06 - land on the uh target square
01:10 - and if you miss you get you know thrown
01:12 - to lava or you just
01:13 - die from fall damage so um let's begin
01:17 - so we're gonna open up the same
01:19 - minecraft world that we made for our
01:20 - first part of the obstacle course
01:23 - so that we can continue to add on our
01:25 - other two obstacles
01:26 - so let's continue
01:32 - let's start by making the reign of
01:34 - arrows obstacle
01:37 - to begin we want to have a concrete
01:39 - blocks
01:40 - for me i'm using stone and what we want
01:43 - to do is place down 12 blocks
01:46 - side by side so 1 2 3
01:50 - 4 5 6 7
01:53 - eight nine ten eleven
01:56 - twelve so we start by placing twelve
01:59 - blocks like this
02:01 - each side we want to place down three
02:04 - blocks um alternating
02:05 - so i'm going to place that one block
02:08 - leave an air
02:09 - another block and another block and um
02:13 - sorry for actually mining this we don't
02:14 - have to do that
02:16 - and we'll do the same thing on the left
02:18 - side
02:20 - so here we're gonna put one block leave
02:22 - for space
02:23 - put down a block leave the space and put
02:25 - down another block like this
02:27 - so now we should have one block one
02:30 - space one block one space one block
02:32 - two spaces one block one space one block
02:34 - one space and one block
02:36 - just like that now we should
02:40 - grab dispensers so here i'm gonna take
02:42 - out my this
02:44 - my pistons type in dispensers
02:51 - and i'm gonna put the dispensers now
02:53 - where the blocks
02:54 - have two blocks long so every one of
02:56 - these six spots i'll put down the
02:58 - dispensers like this
03:04 - this is going to be the wall that we're
03:05 - going to have shooting arrows
03:08 - if you like this video so far don't
03:10 - forget to subscribe and like our videos
03:13 - continuing from what we have started
03:16 - let's have three blocks and the glass
03:18 - are just for
03:18 - reference so i'm gonna put down four
03:20 - blocks like this
03:22 - so that i have four block of space and
03:25 - here i'm gonna put down
03:27 - our obstacle course where our opponent
03:30 - or our
03:32 - and here i'll put down our path where
03:34 - our player will actually trying to
03:35 - parkour
03:37 - here we can have blocks like this
03:40 - and i'm just gonna make them jump
03:41 - through blocks randomly like so
03:48 - and the goal of the game is to have the
03:50 - user jump across without getting hit by
03:51 - the arrow and knocked off
03:53 - now i want to build another five box
03:56 - away so i'm gonna build
03:57 - five glass blocks for reference
04:00 - and here i'm going to start putting down
04:02 - the wall
04:07 - the wall be a 4x2
04:10 - and on top of it i'll put them three
04:12 - more blocks like this
04:15 - now i need to grab a lever so i'm going
04:17 - to grab
04:18 - sorry liver
04:21 - now put it right here
04:26 - and behind this block where the liver
04:28 - lies i want to put down the redstone
04:30 - torch
04:32 - and if i turn off the lever
04:35 - you can see the torch would turn off and
04:37 - i turn it on the torch turn back on
04:40 - next i actually want to build a little
04:42 - platform here
04:44 - so we can actually do our um
04:47 - redstone circuits so similar to what we
04:50 - did here i'm gonna put
04:52 - three blocks like this
04:56 - and here we will be doing the same
04:58 - restaurant contractions so here i'll put
05:00 - down the restroom repeater
05:02 - press some dust across and
05:06 - first stone repeater back
05:09 - and you see this circuit has started
05:12 - and if you turn the liver off the
05:14 - circuits turn off
05:15 - turn it back on and it will turn back on
05:18 - the final step to this project is to
05:20 - connect the circuit to the back
05:22 - of the dispensers so
05:25 - i would do that by digging a hole
05:28 - underneath so the user cannot see
05:30 - um where the restrooms are going so here
05:33 - i'm gonna put down the block bring the
05:36 - restaurant down
05:38 - now start mining
05:46 - and for reference i'm gonna go over here
05:49 - to the
05:51 - other side where i want the rest to come
05:52 - out of and now i take a hole
05:54 - three blocks down and i start digging
05:57 - across until i reach the hole i've made
06:04 - and it is important to note that
06:05 - redstone dust does not carry the
06:07 - signal forever so we should put down a
06:09 - restroom repeater
06:11 - every now and then to refresh the power
06:19 - like so
06:22 - and now we can bring this redstone dust
06:24 - up
06:26 - back here and another
06:29 - redstone repeater and now on the last
06:32 - part is to connect
06:34 - it with our dispensers
06:37 - and we can just do that by placing
06:39 - restaurant dust on top
06:44 - of the blocks that's connected to the
06:46 - dispensaries
06:50 - and now if i just grab arrows from
06:54 - any places and i put some of them here
07:00 - you can see that there arrows are
07:01 - shooting
07:03 - automatically and it will shoot for
07:05 - every one of these
07:07 - and if i turn off the deliver
07:10 - they will stop so we can continue
07:13 - actually putting the arrows in our
07:14 - inventory
07:15 - and i'm just gonna throw the arrows down
07:18 - on the floor
07:19 - so that i can pick them up later and
07:20 - then fill it up
07:22 - so here let me put 60
07:26 - i'm gonna try and put 64 arrows in every
07:28 - one of these
07:36 - okay and to end
07:40 - this obstacle course let's add some lava
07:43 - on the floor so
07:44 - when the users are knocked off they will
07:46 - actually get burned
07:49 - here we can add some spots where
07:53 - every now and then we can have lava
07:56 - blocks
07:58 - like so so now let's start the game
08:02 - by pressing deliver and we can see the
08:05 - arrows are flying up
08:06 - like this and the goal of the game to
08:09 - jump across without getting hit by the
08:10 - arrows
08:13 - next we're going to make our final
08:14 - obstacle called a
08:16 - leap of faith for this project we will
08:19 - need
08:20 - to build up and um the heights
08:24 - can theories but we recommend between 12
08:26 - blocks to 16 so here i have 1
08:29 - 2 3 4 5 6
08:33 - 7 8 9 10
08:36 - 11 12 and you can go higher if you want
08:40 - but 12 bucks is
08:41 - i'm going for now we should use that
08:44 - ladder
08:45 - and make sure we put a ladder on every
08:46 - block so the user can successfully climb
08:52 - up
08:55 - next i'm gonna grab another glass block
08:58 - for reference
08:59 - and i'm also gonna grab a slime ball
09:03 - here we want to have the slime ball
09:07 - uh slime blocks around six to five six
09:10 - to
09:11 - seven blocks away so here we can put six
09:14 - glass blocks
09:17 - for this line and slime blocks if you
09:20 - land on it does not take um
09:22 - any fall damage from the user so the
09:24 - goal of the game is for the user to
09:26 - climb up through the ladder
09:29 - jump on top of the slime blocks and
09:32 - bounce to the destinations
09:34 - so here we can see that if i miss i
09:37 - won't hit anything but if i balance it
09:40 - if i hit it i'll drop bounce back up
09:44 - and we can make the final platform like
09:48 - this
09:54 - and i'm gonna put a red one here
09:57 - signaling that this is the final target
10:03 - like so and again
10:07 - i'm gonna make this game a little bit
10:09 - more interesting by putting lava
10:11 - around our optical targets
10:15 - so here i'm gonna take holes around
10:19 - this landing pad and
10:25 - i'll fill it up with lava
10:41 - and yeah and this is the game of our
10:44 - final obstacle
10:46 - so user can jump and climb up
10:55 - and they can try to jump land on the
10:58 - platform and
11:01 - win our game so that is all for today i
11:04 - hope you guys enjoyed

the user has climbed up um you can see that there's a slime block six blocks away and the objective is to jump and hit the slab block and land on the uh target square and if you miss you get you know thrown to lava or you just die from fall damage so um let's begin so we're gonna open up the same minecraft world that we made for our first part of the obstacle course so that we can continue to add on our other two obstacles so let's continue let's start by making the reign of arrows obstacle to begin we want to have a concrete blocks for me i'm using stone and what we want to do is place down 12 blocks side by side so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight nine ten eleven twelve so we start by placing twelve blocks like this each side we want to place down three blocks um alternating so i'm going to place that one block leave an air another block and another block and um sorry for actually mining this we don't have to do that and we'll do the same thing on the left side so here we're gonna put one block leave for space put down a block leave the space and put down another block like this so now we should have one block one space one block one space one block two spaces one block one space one block one space and one block just like that now we should grab dispensers so here i'm gonna take out my this my pistons type in dispensers and i'm gonna put the dispensers now where the blocks have two blocks long so every one of these six spots i'll put down the dispensers like this this is going to be the wall that we're going to have shooting arrows if you like this video so far don't forget to subscribe and like our videos continuing from what we have started let's have three blocks and the glass are just for reference so i'm gonna put down four blocks like this so that i have four block of space and here i'm gonna put down our obstacle course where our opponent or our and here i'll put down our path where our player will actually trying to parkour here we can have blocks like this and i'm just gonna make them jump through blocks randomly like so and the goal of the game is to have the user jump across without getting hit by the arrow and knocked off now i want to build another

this circuit has started and if you turn the liver off the circuits turn off turn it back on and it will turn back on the final step to this project is to connect the circuit to the back of the dispensers so i would do that by digging a hole underneath so the user cannot see um where the restrooms are going so here i'm gonna put down the block bring the restaurant down now start mining and for reference i'm gonna go over here to the other side where i want the rest to come out of and now i take a hole three blocks down and i start digging across until i reach the hole i've made and it is important to note that redstone dust does not carry the signal forever so we should put down a restroom repeater every now and then to refresh the power like so and now we can bring this redstone dust up back here and another redstone repeater and now on the last part is to connect it with our dispensers and we can just do that by placing restaurant dust on top of the blocks that's connected to the dispensaries and now if i just grab arrows from any places and i put some of them here you can see that there arrows are shooting automatically and it will shoot for every one of these and if i
