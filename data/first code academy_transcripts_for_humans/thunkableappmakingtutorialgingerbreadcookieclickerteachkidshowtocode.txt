00:00 - hello everybody welcome to first code
00:02 - academy and today we're going to do a
00:04 - tutorial on thunkable
00:06 - called gingerbread cookie clicker so in
00:09 - this project i will be using thunkable
00:11 - to create an app that will allow me to
00:14 - play
00:15 - a christmas version of the game cookie
00:18 - clicker
00:18 - in the game cookie clicker the objective
00:20 - is to bake as many cookies as you can
00:22 - by tapping the little cookie men
00:27 - so i'm tapping here and i'm getting
00:28 - every one cookie every time i tap it
00:31 - you'll see that there's two extra
00:32 - buttons the upgrade button which allows
00:35 - me
00:36 - to purchase and upgrade to get more
00:38 - cookies per click
00:40 - and the save button which allows me to
00:44 - save my progress so if i close the app
00:46 - and i open it again
00:48 - i will retrieve the same values you can
00:51 - find the link to the thunkable page
00:53 - in the description down below now let's
00:55 - go into coding it
00:56 - so today we're gonna divide the process
01:00 - of making the app into two steps
01:02 - the first step we're gonna design how
01:04 - the app looks and in the second step
01:06 - we're gonna
01:07 - build the blocks for the app to work
01:10 - so let's go straight into the first step
01:12 - we open a new thunkable project
01:15 - i already named it cookie clicker i'm
01:18 - gonna
01:18 - [Music]
01:20 - do is make it resemble what i just
01:22 - showed you before
01:23 - so the first thing is we want it to be
01:25 - christmas themed
01:27 - so i'm gonna change the colors to some
01:29 - red and some green
01:31 - so i'm gonna use red for the background
01:34 - and i'm gonna use green for the letters
01:37 - and the buttons
01:39 - now the most important part well besides
01:41 - the christmas message i'm gonna put a
01:43 - label over here
01:45 - i'm also gonna need an image to
01:48 - put the cookie inside so i scroll down
01:52 - here
01:53 - all the way to image and i can add it
01:55 - down here
01:57 - you'll see that in this case the image
02:00 - shows
02:00 - above the label you can actually change
02:04 - the order here
02:05 - by dragging them and whichever is at the
02:08 - bottom is the one that's going to show
02:09 - at the bottom of the screen
02:12 - i'm going to proceed by adding another
02:14 - label down here which is the one that is
02:16 - going to tell me how many cookies i have
02:18 - all the same i want it down here so i'm
02:21 - gonna put it here
02:23 - and two buttons one next to the other
02:28 - now if i try to put the buttons just
02:31 - like this
02:32 - bottom one and bottom two for example
02:35 - and
02:36 - i'm gonna drag it down for example
02:39 - well i have a button here i have a label
02:42 - that i don't need so
02:44 - i'm just gonna delete this one but
02:47 - yes i want to delete that one i want
02:50 - another button
02:52 - here you see that the buttons are one on
02:55 - top of the other
02:56 - and there's a really a simple way to
02:58 - just tell
03:00 - thunkable hey i want you to be one next
03:02 - to the other one because
03:04 - they try to keep things simple and just
03:06 - put objects
03:08 - in a straight line down there but they
03:12 - to fix this in layouts they have
03:15 - something called rows and columns
03:17 - just like a table so if you put objects
03:19 - in a row it will put them
03:21 - one next to your horizontally if you put
03:24 - objects in a column it will group them
03:26 - vertically so i want just to group them
03:29 - horizontally i'll just
03:31 - just add a rover here i'm gonna put it
03:33 - down here
03:35 - and to make them belong to the row
03:38 - i can just drag them in a way that is
03:40 - inside you'll see that there's a red
03:42 - little border next to where it says row
03:45 - here
03:46 - that means that i'm putting the button
03:47 - inside the row i'm going to do the same
03:49 - but i put it below here so you put it
03:52 - one next to the other
03:53 - now you see that my row is way too big
03:56 - it occupies almost
03:58 - all of the screen i'm going to change
04:00 - the height
04:01 - here and put an absolute size of
04:05 - 150 of course you can change that
04:08 - depending on what you want you can put
04:10 - 100 and you will
04:12 - adjust it differently now for the labels
04:16 - well i'm going to change the texts of
04:18 - course
04:19 - here merry christmas
04:22 - and here remember we sent the message
04:26 - you have baked
04:29 - zero cookies because of course you
04:32 - haven't played yet
04:33 - so there's no cookies baked
04:36 - for the image down here i looked for a
04:39 - gingerbread
04:40 - man image png download the one you like
04:44 - the most i use png because they have
04:46 - no background so when i put it down here
04:49 - let's see i already have it in my
04:51 - computer
04:53 - so when i put the cookie here see
04:57 - what usually would look white it still
05:01 - looks red
05:01 - because i have no background so it just
05:04 - copies the same color as my background
05:06 - now for the merry christmas message i
05:09 - can go to advanced
05:11 - and change the text style i can change
05:14 - here the color
05:14 - i'm gonna put a dark green i'm gonna
05:17 - make sure to remember
05:18 - this color maybe here it's gonna copy
05:22 - this code
05:25 - and use that code to change the color of
05:28 - this one as well
05:29 - so i can put here and paste that color
05:31 - in the hex file
05:34 - the same as with the button i can go
05:36 - back to simple i think this one is
05:38 - easier here
05:40 - oh wait sorry not the test color the
05:44 - background color
05:48 - i can put here and this one as well
05:53 - and i want let's say a different
05:57 - style for the merry christmas message i
05:58 - want to make it more
06:00 - more good looking i can
06:03 - put in the fun family here in advanced i
06:06 - can choose different fonts
06:08 - which fonts can i choose well you can go
06:10 - to the documentation for
06:13 - thunkable and you'll see a list of all
06:15 - the fonts available
06:16 - unfortunate unfortunately for android
06:18 - there's not many fonts
06:20 - for ios there's a huge list of phones
06:22 - and since i'm testing my app in ios i
06:25 - thought that i
06:25 - could use this font over here the last
06:28 - one
06:29 - sapphino i like how it looks it gives
06:31 - like a very
06:32 - holiday by and i can
06:35 - make it bigger with font size and
06:38 - i'm gonna put it bold
06:41 - i can even put something more old like
06:43 - 300
06:45 - or maybe 500 okay
06:48 - and yeah that's it i'm gonna put this
06:51 - one as well
06:52 - bold i can just do it in simple
06:55 - here font weight bold
06:59 - all right oh of course i i still need to
07:02 - change the text of my buttons
07:04 - so here i'll put upgrade
07:07 - and then the cost of my first upgrade
07:11 - 25 and in here i'm gonna make a bottom
07:14 - to save the game so if i close the app
07:16 - and i open it again
07:18 - well i can keep making the cookies i
07:20 - already had before
07:22 - and that's pretty much it for the design
07:26 - so right now we're gonna move into the
07:29 - blocks
07:31 - so right now i already set up some
07:34 - initial
07:35 - values to work with blocks and to
07:39 - add these values right i grab the blocks
07:42 - from the variables blocks
07:44 - okay i initialize three variables
07:48 - of type app these variables when i close
07:51 - the program they will disappear forever
07:54 - and they will when i open the app again
07:57 - they will set up to these initial values
07:58 - i have over here
08:00 - cookies well it's how many cookies i
08:02 - have i think i better just set it up to
08:04 - zero
08:06 - cookies per click sorry i think i i put
08:09 - it backwards
08:10 - sorry for cookies per click is how many
08:12 - cookies i get
08:13 - for each click for each top of the
08:15 - bottom i do
08:16 - into the cookie and the upgrade cost is
08:19 - how much is it gonna cost for me
08:21 - to get more cookies per click i do i
08:26 - also have the same
08:27 - variables but of the store type
08:31 - so stored to for me to recognize that
08:34 - they're different i put them stored
08:36 - under dash cookies
08:37 - start under dash cpz and stored under
08:40 - the upgrade cost so
08:43 - stored variables are the variables that
08:46 - are saved in the memory of the
08:47 - cell phone so when you close the app
08:51 - and you open it again you can find these
08:54 - values
08:55 - all right the reason i did two of them
08:58 - is because usually
09:00 - for a phone it's slower to get the
09:02 - values
09:03 - from the sort space than it is from the
09:06 - app space
09:08 - however you can uh
09:11 - change these values accordingly if you
09:13 - don't really like one or the other or if
09:14 - you
09:15 - think you made an upgrade that you
09:17 - didn't want like if the game gets too
09:19 - complicated
09:20 - and somebody wants to save or
09:22 - [Music]
09:23 - not save it's good for us to learn
09:26 - that there's two different types of
09:28 - variables that can be used for different
09:29 - situations so for example the app
09:31 - variable
09:32 - can be used if you want the value to be
09:36 - used rapidly and disappear maybe some
09:39 - time
09:40 - whereas the stored variable is a
09:42 - variable that you may want to use
09:44 - repeatedly later okay
09:47 - so the first thing and the most basic
09:50 - thing we need to do in this app
09:52 - is when i click the image of the
09:53 - gingerbread man
09:55 - i'm gonna get a new cookie so
09:58 - let's go here into image and grab this
10:00 - block when image one click
10:02 - so whenever i click the gingerbread man
10:04 - i will get a new cookie
10:07 - and how do i get well
10:11 - if i have cpc value of one means how
10:14 - many cookies i get per click to one
10:16 - i'll get one more cookie but if i bought
10:18 - an upgrade
10:20 - and now i get two cookies every time i
10:22 - click i should
10:24 - still get the two cookies not just one
10:26 - every time i click this button
10:28 - to do that well we're gonna change the
10:30 - value of this variable
10:32 - of the cookies i have by how many
10:34 - cookies i get
10:35 - every time i click the image
10:38 - so in variables we have the initialize
10:42 - variable which means the initial value
10:45 - of the variable
10:46 - which i already put down there set
10:49 - the value to something specific or
10:52 - change it by a certain number
10:54 - i'm gonna grab this one and put it down
10:58 - here
10:59 - so i'm gonna change the app variable
11:00 - cookies by how much
11:03 - well is this block over here cpc
11:06 - so i can go to variables and grab this
11:09 - app variable cpc block and put it down
11:11 - here
11:13 - that i have a new cookie i want to
11:15 - update
11:17 - the label the remember the label down
11:19 - here that says
11:20 - you have baked zero cookies
11:23 - this one in this case is label two
11:26 - so i can go back here in blocks
11:29 - click on label two from label to set
11:33 - text to now the text will read
11:36 - you have number baked
11:40 - and cookies baked so far okay
11:43 - so you have or you have baked number
11:46 - cookies
11:47 - the message is of course up to you you
11:50 - can make it a little bit different
11:52 - that's still fine what we're gonna do is
11:54 - we're gonna join
11:55 - three messages right you have baked
11:58 - the number and cookies
12:02 - so i'm gonna use this block join in the
12:04 - text category
12:08 - if i click on the gear i can join more
12:10 - than one two texts
12:12 - so i'm gonna make it so i joined three
12:14 - so remember the first one
12:15 - is gonna be you have baked
12:20 - the second one i'm gonna leave it empty
12:21 - for the number and the third one i'm
12:23 - gonna put cookies
12:26 - now in the middle one how many cookies
12:27 - have i baked
12:29 - that one is the variable i get from here
12:32 - cookies
12:32 - so you have baked up variable cookies
12:36 - quiz and that's how we display the value
12:42 - next thing we need we're gonna do is
12:45 - we're gonna set the upgrade button
12:48 - this button over here when i click it
12:50 - will allow me to
12:52 - if i have the enough cookies get more
12:55 - cookies for every click i make
12:58 - so let's start this one is button one
13:02 - so when i click button one something
13:03 - else is bound to happen
13:06 - what's it well what needs to happen well
13:09 - first i need to ask
13:10 - do i have enough cookies to get the
13:13 - better
13:13 - cooking machine so i can get two cookies
13:16 - every time i click it
13:18 - or are my cookies not enough
13:21 - to ask questions like this in
13:22 - programming remember
13:24 - we use if statements we're going to grab
13:28 - this if statement over here
13:29 - and indeed in that if statement in this
13:31 - section
13:33 - ways where the question will be do i
13:35 - have enough cookies
13:36 - or i don't have enough cookies so the
13:39 - answer for this one is for example
13:41 - if my cost is 25 for me to have enough
13:45 - cookies would be if i have 25 cookies 26
13:47 - cookies 27 cookies
13:50 - or more so you have if i have more
13:52 - cookies than what the opera
13:54 - costs i can make the upgrade
13:57 - to do this you'll notice that thunkable
14:00 - has this
14:02 - greater than less than equal then
14:05 - but it doesn't have any credit equal
14:09 - unless you click on it so you have to
14:12 - grab
14:13 - any of those and search for it directly
14:16 - you don't just get it from here
14:17 - okay so we're gonna have if a value
14:20 - is greater equal than another value if
14:23 - my cookies i have
14:24 - are bigger than what the cost of the
14:27 - upgrade is
14:29 - then i will do the upgrade
14:33 - here i have how many cookies i have and
14:35 - if that value is bigger than
14:38 - a variable upgrade cost how much an
14:40 - upgrade costs
14:42 - then okay first of all
14:46 - if i have 30 cookies and the upgrade is
14:49 - 25
14:51 - if i purchase the upgrade i should have
14:53 - only five cookies
14:55 - after that the purchase is done so i
14:58 - will first
14:59 - set this new variable cookies and take
15:03 - away
15:04 - from the number of cookies the cost of
15:06 - the upgrade
15:07 - so to do any type of these operations we
15:12 - go to math here
15:13 - and we're subtracting right we're
15:16 - subtracting
15:18 - the number of cookies we have
15:22 - and taking away from that the cost of
15:25 - the upgrade
15:26 - if you see that because we have this
15:28 - check in place
15:30 - the cookies will never go negative you
15:32 - will always have enough cookies
15:34 - if you want to do this operation after
15:37 - that
15:38 - well we have an upgrade right so what
15:40 - are what are we upgrading
15:43 - well sorry not this one we're upgrading
15:46 - the value
15:47 - of the cookies per click so we're
15:50 - changing the value of the cookies per
15:52 - click
15:53 - on the app by one so if i did
15:56 - two cookies per click now i'll do three
15:58 - coopies per click
16:00 - and so on now
16:03 - the upgrades will make it so that they
16:05 - become more expensive the more of them i
16:08 - buy
16:09 - so i'm gonna change the variable
16:13 - of this upgrade cost by
16:16 - if i do change by some number
16:20 - then in a way i'm i'm basing it
16:24 - off a certain like solid number what i
16:26 - can do is if i want to make it
16:28 - harder and harder to get more upgrades
16:30 - so people get more interested in keeping
16:32 - in playing more and more i can change it
16:35 - by my own number
16:36 - so if i cost 25 i'm the upgrade i cost
16:40 - 25
16:41 - for the next upgrade i'm going to cost
16:42 - 50. so add 25 to myself
16:45 - 25 plus 25 50. for the next upgrade
16:48 - cycle
16:49 - i cost 50 then i myself 50 now i cost a
16:52 - hundred
16:53 - and then i keep going like this until it
16:55 - gets very expensive and people are more
16:57 - invested into playing
16:59 - so this is just one example of course
17:02 - you can
17:03 - do it in a different way but i think in
17:06 - this way
17:06 - you will get double double double the
17:08 - upgrade cost so it's becoming harder and
17:10 - harder more of a challenge to get the
17:12 - number higher and higher
17:15 - the last thing we're gonna do is
17:18 - i'm going to change the text of the
17:20 - button right
17:22 - and change the text of the label
17:26 - so first that label over here remember
17:28 - is label 2.
17:31 - it's the same value we have here so i
17:32 - can just duplicate this
17:34 - block right click duplicate
17:37 - and put it down here so i do the same
17:41 - thing
17:42 - where i show the message of how many
17:43 - cookies i have left
17:45 - and i will change the text of the bottom
17:48 - one
17:49 - too remember the text of this one is
17:53 - upgrade and how many cookies
17:56 - it costs to do the upgrade so i'll keep
17:59 - it that way
18:00 - i have two values upgrade and how much
18:02 - it costs
18:03 - so i'll use a join block i'll put it
18:06 - down here
18:08 - i'll replace this hello with upgrade
18:12 - and the second one i'll just throw it
18:14 - here because i need the cost
18:15 - of the cookies upgrade so
18:19 - the cost perfect so this one will
18:23 - resolve the upgrade button now we have
18:25 - one more button left
18:26 - to code the bottom we have left is
18:30 - to store the variable right to store
18:32 - these variables
18:34 - these app variables into the stored part
18:37 - of the program
18:38 - so that when we open the program again
18:40 - we can access those values
18:42 - so when i click that button which is
18:46 - button number two
18:49 - i'm gonna save these variables these
18:51 - local app variables
18:53 - into the stored variables so we'll
18:57 - set the value of the stored variable
19:00 - for example stored cookies to
19:03 - the variable cookies
19:07 - i can duplicate this so i can save more
19:09 - work
19:12 - and change store variable cookies start
19:14 - cpc
19:15 - will get the value of cpc and stored
19:19 - upgrade cost will get the very
19:20 - the value of app of recast
19:24 - this way i saved it into the storage of
19:26 - the cell phone
19:28 - and i can access it later
19:31 - so to finish the program of course we
19:33 - want to access it
19:34 - if i close the app and i open it again i
19:37 - want to read those values again
19:40 - i'll go over here to screen
19:44 - one and when the screen opens
19:47 - or when the screen starts until when the
19:50 - screen starts
19:52 - if the values of the star variables are
19:54 - not
19:56 - zero right or are not empty if i have
19:59 - something inside of them
20:01 - then i want to actually use those values
20:04 - because what will happen if those values
20:07 - are not
20:08 - like uh are not the initial ones then
20:12 - there's a problem you know if you have
20:15 - zero cookies per click and you start
20:17 - clicking
20:18 - on the cookie you'll just see zero zero
20:20 - zero zero zero like if you're not doing
20:22 - anything
20:23 - you need to make sure that when you load
20:24 - those values there's actually a value
20:26 - that makes sense there
20:29 - to do that well the value we curve
20:32 - the most about would be how many cookies
20:35 - you get per click
20:38 - so if
20:41 - and we'll do a comparison
20:44 - if the cookies i do per click is bigger
20:46 - than zero
20:47 - so if store variable
20:51 - cookies per click is bigger than zero
20:56 - [Music]
20:59 - or bigger than zero bigger than one
21:02 - basically it's up to you i think bigger
21:06 - than zero
21:06 - makes it so that there's at least
21:09 - something maybe they did like three
21:11 - cookies and they want to save
21:13 - so so it doesn't make much sense that
21:15 - you punish them for not cooking enough
21:17 - baking enough cookies or maybe they
21:19 - upgraded all the way to 11
21:21 - the level 10 then they did them last
21:23 - purchase and now they have zero cookies
21:25 - if you try to compare with the cookies
21:27 - and they will lose all their progress
21:29 - so i think cpc is a better measurement
21:32 - because when you first create these
21:35 - stored variables they have no value so
21:37 - if at least if their value is bigger
21:38 - than zero you know they have played and
21:40 - saved once
21:42 - so if that value is okay then we'll do
21:44 - the reverse of this operation
21:46 - so instead of getting from the app
21:48 - variable to the start variable
21:49 - we'll get the value from the start
21:51 - variable and save it into the app
21:53 - variable so i can just duplicate this
21:58 - i'll just put this down here i don't
22:00 - need this button too anymore
22:02 - and change the order so app variable
22:05 - cookies will get the value from store
22:07 - cookies
22:08 - app variable cpc will get the value from
22:11 - stored cpc
22:12 - and app variable upgrade cost will get
22:15 - the
22:15 - value from start upgrade cost
22:19 - and that's pretty much it for this app
22:26 - okay so i have the project open up down
22:28 - here
22:29 - and this is the finished product
22:33 - so you see i can get more cookies
22:36 - here the cookies and i'm getting one per
22:38 - click i'm going to upgrade
22:42 - and i will get super click
22:47 - keep operating
22:50 - i have 40 then i have 80.
22:54 - next is 160 but now i'm getting
22:57 - more cookies per click
23:02 - hmm keep going keep going keep going and
23:04 - now i get 5x5
23:07 - okay i really hope you enjoyed this
23:09 - project like this little
23:11 - christmas project you can show to your
23:12 - family and friends
23:14 - that's gonna be all for today thanks for
23:16 - watching i hope you enjoyed the tutorial
23:18 - see you on the next one

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody welcome to first code academy and today we're going to do a tutorial on thunkable called gingerbread cookie clicker so in this project i will be using thunkable to create an app that will allow me to play a christmas version of the game cookie clicker in the game cookie clicker the objective is to bake as many cookies as you can by tapping the little cookie men so i'm tapping here and i'm getting every one cookie every time i tap it you'll see that there's two extra buttons the upgrade button which allows me to purchase and upgrade to get more cookies per click and the save button which allows me to save my progress so if i close the app and i open it again i will retrieve the same values you can find the link to the thunkable page in the description down below now let's go into coding it so today we're gonna divide the process of making the app into two steps the first step we're gonna design how the app looks and in the second step we're gonna build the blocks for the app to work so let's go straight into the first step we open a new thunkable project i already named it cookie clicker i'm gonna do is make it resemble what i just showed you before so the first thing is we want it to be christmas themed so i'm gonna change the colors to some red and some green so i'm gonna use red for the background and i'm gonna use green for the letters and the buttons now the most important part well besides the christmas message i'm gonna put a label over here i'm also gonna need an image to put the cookie inside so i scroll down here all the way to image and i can add it down here you'll see that in this case the image shows above the label you can actually change the order here by dragging them and whichever is at the bottom is the one that's going to show at the bottom of the screen i'm going to proceed by adding another label down here which is the one that is going to tell me how many cookies i have all the same i want it down here so i'm gonna put it here and two buttons one next to the other now if i try to put the buttons just like this bottom one and bottom two for example and i'm gonna drag it down for example well i have a button here i have a label that i don't need so i'm just gonna delete this one but yes i want to delete that one i want another button here you see that the buttons are one on top of the other and there's a really a simple way to just tell thunkable hey i want you to be one next to the other one because they try to keep things simple and just put objects in a straight line down there but they to fix this in layouts they have something called rows and columns just like a table so if you put objects in a row it will put them one next to your horizontally if you put objects in a column it will group them vertically so i want just to group them horizontally i'll just just add a rover here i'm gonna put it down here and to make them belong to the row i can just drag them in a way that is inside you'll see that there's a red little border next to where it says row here that means that i'm putting the button inside the row i'm going to do the same but i put it below here so you put it one next to the other now you see that my row is way too big it occupies almost all of the screen i'm going to change the height here and put an absolute size of 150 of course you can change that depending on what you want you can put 100 and you will adjust it differently now for the labels well i'm going to change the texts of course here merry christmas and here remember we sent the message you have baked zero cookies because of course you haven't played yet so there's no cookies baked for the image down here i looked for a gingerbread man image png download the one you like the most i use png because they have no background so when i put it down here let's see i already have it in my computer so when i put the cookie here see what usually would look white it still looks red because i have no background so it just copies the same color as my background now for the merry christmas message i can go to advanced and change the text style i can change here the color i'm gonna put a dark green i'm gonna make sure to remember this color maybe here it's gonna copy this code and use that code to change the color of this one as well so i can put here and paste that color in the hex file the same as with the button i can go back to simple i think this one is easier here oh wait sorry not the test color the background color i can put here and this one as well and i want let's say a different style for the merry christmas message i want to make it more more good looking i can put in the fun family here in advanced i can choose different fonts which fonts can i choose well you can go to the documentation for thunkable and you'll see a list of all the fonts available unfortunate unfortunately for android there's not many fonts for ios there's a huge list of phones and since i'm testing my app in ios i thought that i could use this font over here the last one sapphino i like how it looks it gives like a very holiday by and i can make it bigger with font size and i'm gonna put it bold i can even put something more old like 300 or maybe 500 okay and yeah that's it i'm gonna put this one as well bold i can just do it in simple here font weight bold all right oh of course i i still need to change the text of my buttons so here i'll put upgrade and then the cost of my first upgrade 25 and in here i'm gonna make a bottom to save the game so if i close the app and i open it again well i can keep making the cookies i already had before and that's pretty much it for the design so right now we're gonna move into the blocks so right now i already set up some initial values to work with blocks and to add these values right i grab the blocks from the variables blocks okay i initialize three variables of type app these variables when i close the program they will disappear forever and they will when i open the app again they will set up to these initial values i have over here cookies well it's how many cookies i have i think i better just set it up to zero cookies per click sorry i think i i put it backwards sorry for cookies per click is how many cookies i get for each click for each top of the bottom i do into the cookie and the upgrade cost is how much is it gonna cost for me to get more cookies per click i do i also have the same variables but of the store type so stored to for me to recognize that they're different i put them stored under dash cookies start under dash cpz and stored under the upgrade cost so stored variables are the variables that are saved in the memory of the cell phone so when you close the app and you open it again you can find these values all right the reason i did two of them is because usually for a phone it's slower to get the values from the sort space than it is from the app space however you can uh change these values accordingly if you don't really like one or the other or if you think you made an upgrade that you didn't want like if the game gets too complicated and somebody wants to save or not save it's good for us to learn that there's two different types of variables that can be used for different situations so for example the app variable can be used if you want the value to be used rapidly and disappear maybe some time whereas the stored variable is a variable that you may want to use repeatedly later okay so the first thing and the most basic thing we need to do in this app is when i click the image of the gingerbread man i'm gonna get a new cookie so let's go here into image and grab this block when image one click so whenever i click the gingerbread man i will get a new cookie and how do i get well if i have cpc value of one means how many cookies i get per click to one i'll get one more cookie but if i bought an upgrade and now i get two cookies every time i click i should still get the two cookies not just one every time i click this button to do that well we're gonna change the value of this variable of the cookies i have by how many cookies i get every time i click the image so in variables we have the initialize variable which means the initial value of the variable which i already put down there set the value to something specific or change it by a certain number i'm gonna grab this one and put it down here so i'm gonna change the app variable cookies by how much well is this block over here cpc so i can go to variables and grab this app variable cpc block and put it down here that i have a new cookie i want to update the label the remember the label down here that says you have baked zero cookies this one in this case is label two so i can go back here in blocks click on label two from label to set text to now the text will read you have number baked and cookies baked so far okay so you have or you have baked number cookies the message is of course up to you you can make it a little bit different that's still fine what we're gonna do is we're gonna join three messages right you have baked the number and cookies so i'm gonna use this block join in the text category if i click on the gear i can join more than one two texts so i'm gonna make it so i joined three so remember the first one is gonna be you have baked the second one i'm gonna leave it empty for the number and the third one i'm gonna put cookies now in the middle one how many cookies have i baked that one is the variable i get from here cookies so you have baked up variable cookies quiz and that's how we display the value next thing we need we're gonna do is we're gonna set the upgrade button this button over here when i click it will allow me to if i have the enough cookies get more cookies for every click i make so let's start this one is button one so when i click button one something else is bound to happen what's it well what needs to happen well first i need to ask do i have enough cookies to get the better cooking machine so i can get two cookies every time i click it or are my cookies not enough to ask questions like this in programming remember we use if statements we're going to grab this if statement over here and indeed in that if statement in this section ways where the question will be do i have enough cookies or i don't have enough cookies so the answer for this one is for example if my cost is 25 for me to have enough cookies would be if i have 25 cookies 26 cookies 27 cookies or more so you have if i have more cookies than what the opera costs i can make the upgrade to do this you'll notice that thunkable has this greater than less than equal then but it doesn't have any credit equal unless you click on it so you have to grab any of those and search for it directly you don't just get it from here okay so we're gonna have if a value is greater equal than another value if my cookies i have are bigger than what the cost of the upgrade is then i will do the upgrade here i have how many cookies i have and if that value is bigger than a variable upgrade cost how much an upgrade costs then okay first of all if i have 30 cookies and the upgrade is 25 if i purchase the upgrade i should have only five cookies after that the purchase is done so i will first set this new variable cookies and take away from the number of cookies the cost of the upgrade so to do any type of these operations we go to math here and we're subtracting right we're subtracting the number of cookies we have and taking away from that the cost of the upgrade if you see that because we have this check in place the cookies will never go negative you will always have enough cookies if you want to do this operation after that well we have an upgrade right so what are what are we upgrading well sorry not this one we're upgrading the value of the cookies per click so we're changing the value of the cookies per click on the app by one so if i did two cookies per click now i'll do three coopies per click and so on now the upgrades will make it so that they become more expensive the more of them i buy so i'm gonna change the variable of this upgrade cost by if i do change by some number then in a way i'm i'm basing it off a certain like solid number what i can do is if i want to make it harder and harder to get more upgrades so people get more interested in keeping in playing more and more i can change it by my own number so if i cost 25 i'm the upgrade i cost 25 for the next upgrade i'm going to cost 50. so add 25 to myself 25 plus 25 50. for the next upgrade cycle i cost 50 then i myself 50 now i cost a hundred and then i keep going like this until it gets very expensive and people are more invested into playing so this is just one example of course you can do it in a different way but i think in this way you will get double double double the upgrade cost so it's becoming harder and harder more of a challenge to get the number higher and higher the last thing we're gonna do is i'm going to change the text of the button right and change the text of the label so first that label over here remember is label 2. it's the same value we have here so i can just duplicate this block right click duplicate and put it down here so i do the same thing where i show the message of how many cookies i have left and i will change the text of the bottom one too remember the text of this one is upgrade and how many cookies it costs to do the upgrade so i'll keep it that way i have two values upgrade and how much it costs so i'll use a join block i'll put it down here i'll replace this hello with upgrade and the second one i'll just throw it here because i need the cost of the cookies upgrade so the cost perfect so this one will resolve the upgrade button now we have one more button left to code the bottom we have left is to store the variable right to store these variables these app variables into the stored part of the program so that when we open the program again we can access those values so when i click that button which is button number two i'm gonna save these variables these local app variables into the stored variables so we'll set the value of the stored variable for example stored cookies to the variable cookies i can duplicate this so i can save more work and change store variable cookies start cpc will get the value of cpc and stored upgrade cost will get the very the value of app of recast this way i saved it into the storage of the cell phone and i can access it later so to finish the program of course we want to access it if i close the app and i open it again i want to read those values again i'll go over here to screen one and when the screen opens or when the screen starts until when the screen starts if the values of the star variables are not zero right or are not empty if i have something inside of them then i want to actually use those values because what will happen if those values are not like uh are not the initial ones then there's a problem you know if you have zero cookies per click and you start clicking on the cookie you'll just see zero zero zero zero zero like if you're not doing anything you need to make sure that when you load those values there's actually a value that makes sense there to do that well the value we curve the most about would be how many cookies you get per click so if and we'll do a comparison if the cookies i do per click is bigger than zero so if store variable cookies per click is bigger than zero or bigger than zero bigger than one basically it's up to you i think bigger than zero makes it so that there's at least something maybe they did like three cookies and they want to save so so it doesn't make much sense that you punish them for not cooking enough baking enough cookies or maybe they upgraded all the way to 11 the level 10 then they did them last purchase and now they have zero cookies if you try to compare with the cookies and they will lose all their progress so i think cpc is a better measurement because when you first create these stored variables they have no value so if at least if their value is bigger than zero you know they have played and saved once so if that value is okay then we'll do the reverse of this operation so instead of getting from the app variable to the start variable we'll get the value from the start variable and save it into the app variable so i can just duplicate this i'll just put this down here i don't need this button too anymore and change the order so app variable cookies will get the value from store cookies app variable cpc will get the value from stored cpc and app variable upgrade cost will get the value from start upgrade cost and that's pretty much it for this app okay so i have the project open up down here and this is the finished product so you see i can get more cookies here the cookies and i'm getting one per click i'm going to upgrade and i will get super click keep operating i have 40 then i have 80. next is 160 but now i'm getting more cookies per click hmm keep going keep going keep going and now i get 5x5 okay i really hope you enjoyed this project like this little christmas project you can show to your family and friends that's gonna be all for today thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed the tutorial see you on the next one
