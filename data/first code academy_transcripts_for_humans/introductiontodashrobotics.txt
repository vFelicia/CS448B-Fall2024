00:00 - hello everyone so today we're getting to
00:02 - know - we're gonna learn about what -
00:05 - didn't do and where - was made and
00:08 - through learning what - and
00:11 - understanding - we're gonna be
00:12 - introduced to the amazing world of
00:14 - robotics and coding so let's begin we
00:18 - are going to look at where - was created
00:22 - - was created in the United States by a
00:26 - robotics and educational start-up called
00:28 - the Wonder workshop in the year 2014 the
00:32 - Wonder workshop is not only home to -
00:34 - but it's also the home to the dot robot
00:37 - and another robot called Q in a bit
00:41 - you're gonna hear - say hello he's gonna
00:44 - say hey what is the robot a robot is a
00:49 - machine which is able to do things that
00:51 - are dangerous or repetitive for humans
00:54 - it is able to understand instructions
00:56 - that's given by humans through a
00:58 - computer or a tablet using something
01:00 - called code - can also be given
01:03 - instruction through an iPad by dragging
01:05 - code that looks like puzzle pieces which
01:07 - can be actually attached to each other
01:09 - here's a little fun fact do you know
01:11 - that 40% of robots in the world are
01:13 - actually in Japan depend has the most
01:16 - amount of bots on earth
01:20 - in our life there are actually a lot of
01:22 - robots around us and robots help us to
01:25 - do a lot of things they're used in
01:27 - helping save lives helping build cars
01:30 - delivering goods and even helping us
01:33 - find out more about what's happening in
01:34 - space the first image there is a robot
01:37 - helping build a Tesla car the second
01:40 - image is of a robot on Mars and so the
01:42 - third one what is coding coding is
01:46 - writing a bunch of instructions to a
01:48 - computer or robot when you want it to do
01:50 - something for example if you want to
01:52 - tell - to move around and make a sound
01:54 - all you would need is your trusty finger
01:57 - and an iPad isn't that amazing so let's
02:00 - look at what - can do - is also able to
02:03 - give greetings such as and now he's
02:07 - gonna turn around here you're gonna see
02:10 - - spin and light up in different colors
02:13 - lights flash from - is front which is
02:15 - right under his eyes and there's also
02:18 - light flashing from the left and right
02:20 - ear of - we're gonna look at how - can
02:26 - move just like us it can go forward
02:29 - backwards
02:43 - - has four buttons on the top of him
02:47 - so there is button one which has one dot
02:50 - there is button 2 which has two dots and
02:52 - then there's button three which has
02:54 - three dots
02:55 - the big button that's right in the
02:57 - middle a big white circle is called the
03:01 - top button so these buttons can trigger
03:03 - some events when they are pressed one
03:06 - cool thing is - can make sounds you're
03:08 - going to hear different animal sounds in
03:10 - the way what you're hearing is -
03:12 - mimicking a cat a dog a crocodile each
03:18 - button triggers an event when I press
03:20 - the talk button the sound of an engine
03:24 - revving when I press button - - will
03:27 - make a sound
03:35 - I press the button three on - - is gonna
03:39 - make this what our sensors humans we
03:45 - have the ability to sense such as sight
03:48 - smell taste touch and field
03:50 - robots like - also have sensors - has
03:54 - sensors which have the ability to do
03:56 - some interesting things for example -
03:58 - can detect when something is in front of
04:00 - it and also when something is behind it
04:03 - and you can program - to tell it what to
04:07 - do when it sees an obstacle so let's
04:09 - look at what happens next
04:12 - these are the infrared sensors of - has
04:16 - one placed on the top left and one
04:19 - placed on the top right these infrared
04:21 - sensors are very useful when detecting
04:24 - objects and with these sensors we can
04:26 - program - to do things when it sees
04:28 - objects just like the infrared sensor
04:31 - that we had in the front we also have a
04:34 - infrared sensor and - at the back so
04:37 - this is also able to detect obstacles so
04:40 - not only - can see obstacles in the
04:42 - front but it also can see obstacles at
04:46 - the back obstacle detection in this clip
04:49 - we're going to look at - move four and
04:51 - say we and when - detects an obstacle
04:54 - using the infrared sensors in the front
04:56 - it will then stop and say so this is
05:01 - going to work when I press the top
05:03 - button of - and then it's going to
05:05 - trigger the action of moving four so
05:07 - let's look at that
05:13 - [Music]
05:19 - - is gonna go backwards and when the
05:21 - backward sensor of - detects an obstacle
05:23 - is gonna play a sound I hope you guys
05:28 - had fun getting to know - we got to see
05:31 - what - could do and using - would be a
05:34 - really great way to get started with
05:35 - robotics and coding you get to learn
05:38 - about computational thinking and learn
05:40 - how to solve problems through coding and
05:43 - robotics thank you very much for
05:46 - watching this video
05:47 - we hope you liked it please hit the like
05:49 - button please share it and also please
