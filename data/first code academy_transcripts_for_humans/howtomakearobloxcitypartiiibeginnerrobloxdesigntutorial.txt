00:00 - hi guys welcome back to first code
00:01 - academy and today we'll continue
00:04 - on our series on how to build a city in
00:06 - roblox
00:08 - in today's video we'll take a look at
00:10 - how to build roads
00:12 - how to set them up in the city and how
00:14 - to design
00:15 - strategically how to build our roads
00:18 - first
00:19 - to place our buildings in a later stage
00:23 - i hope you like this video remember to
00:25 - like and subscribe
00:29 - so for today's chapter i made a couple
00:32 - of changes
00:33 - uh not very major well the first
00:36 - the only change substantial i have made
00:38 - since live chapter
00:40 - was i extended the base plate because i
00:42 - want to play around with some of the
00:43 - road elements we can include
00:46 - into a roblox project the reason i did
00:49 - this
00:49 - is because i don't want to interfere in
00:51 - the main city so what i did was
00:53 - just go into the base plate over here
00:57 - and change the size i kept the height
00:59 - the same 20
01:00 - but i changed the dimensions to 2 000
01:02 - and 2 000 this is not permanent of
01:04 - course
01:05 - and remember in the end i will get rid
01:07 - of the base plate
01:09 - but for now i'm just going to leave it
01:12 - like that
01:12 - because i want to place the temporary
01:14 - elements there and play around with the
01:16 - road
01:17 - placements first to then show you
01:20 - what it's going to look like in the end
01:23 - now before i
01:24 - do anything else i will
01:27 - do to do something so i don't get
01:30 - confused in the future
01:31 - it's good practice that if you are going
01:34 - to make a new project and you want
01:35 - certain
01:36 - parts of the world to be unique or to
01:39 - differentiate them from the other parts
01:42 - to rename them so you can click again on
01:45 - the name here
01:46 - and i'm going to change this one to the
01:48 - not really a base plate again but i'm
01:50 - going to rename it as
01:52 - just base right uh
01:56 - this is so in the future when i get rid
01:58 - of the base plate i can extend this
02:00 - make it thicker so it looks more like an
02:04 - actual base element of the floor you
02:06 - know
02:07 - uh another good reason to do this to
02:09 - make it thicker
02:10 - it's something called clipping and in
02:12 - video games clipping
02:14 - means when your character moves at a
02:17 - certain speed or in certain angles so
02:19 - that the
02:19 - program fails to calculate in its next
02:22 - position
02:23 - and imagine here is a wall and here's
02:25 - your character
02:26 - and sometimes you gain certain speed at
02:28 - a certain angle
02:30 - and then the game calculates as if it
02:32 - passed through the wall without like
02:34 - hitting the wall exactly in the matter
02:37 - of fraction of a second
02:38 - it is this is pretty rare but it might
02:40 - happen and it will lead to some like
02:42 - weird behaviors in your game so usually
02:45 - you want them to be
02:46 - thick enough so that no matter if it
02:48 - goes like really fast the next position
02:50 - will
02:50 - be inside the wall and the game will
02:52 - know to push it back
02:54 - and not let it go through now with that
02:57 - out of the way
02:59 - i'm going to start by going to the pack
03:02 - texture packs right and you see if you
03:06 - type in road
03:07 - there's many individual elements
03:10 - and those are fine these are great but i
03:13 - prefer
03:14 - packs okay there's two i will recommend
03:17 - and i'll play around and see the
03:18 - difference between
03:19 - both of them first one is a road pack so
03:22 - i'll go
03:22 - straight up here and this road pack
03:26 - is probably one of the most popular ones
03:29 - uh it's
03:30 - main characteristics are that it
03:33 - includes
03:35 - multiple sections of straight roads
03:37 - right
03:38 - some of these roads include like a
03:40 - middle part with the park
03:42 - some other just like a straight line and
03:45 - you can see that it divides it into a
03:46 - grid of four by four
03:48 - so if you hover your mouse like in the
03:50 - select option
03:51 - over many of these you will see that
03:54 - it's four
03:54 - across and four above when you paste
03:57 - them into the world
03:58 - each one will have its own individual
04:00 - name and so you can
04:02 - see that they all priority priority of
04:04 - three-way four-way intersections
04:06 - these are intersections that are these
04:09 - are these four
04:10 - intersections these four straight rows
04:12 - these are straight rows with park
04:14 - and these are curves and other type of
04:17 - intersection
04:19 - now what's the mean difference well
04:22 - these two i consider them are pretty
04:25 - much the same just road road
04:27 - oh yeah the main difference between
04:29 - these two
04:30 - this one is has a driveway so if you
04:32 - want to put a house in here this is a
04:34 - good spot to park the car
04:36 - and the intersections are basically just
04:40 - very well described this is four ways of
04:43 - four cars
04:44 - like cars can go from front four
04:46 - directions and here they can go
04:48 - from three directions in case you want
04:50 - to intersect
04:52 - the road only at one spot these two
04:56 - their main difference is just uh
04:58 - four-way stop and three-way stops
04:59 - instead of using headlights
05:01 - it uses the stop signs same as here
05:04 - so four-way three-way priority
05:07 - the priority one means that the road
05:10 - that has the yellow stripes
05:11 - it's tends to be bigger than the road
05:14 - that comes
05:15 - from the other intersections so one of
05:17 - the roads has priority of
05:19 - way so grow cars that come from the
05:22 - yellow lines
05:23 - will usually well in the real world
05:25 - drive first and the other ones will stop
05:27 - to see if nobody else is coming
05:29 - right the advantage of road packs is for
05:32 - example you can leave it outside of your
05:34 - main world and to
05:38 - manipulate it and you can always use the
05:40 - duplicate function so i can duplicate
05:42 - here
05:45 - and it will create a new copy which i
05:47 - can select and move
05:49 - and the advantage of using road packs is
05:51 - that i can leave them all here
05:53 - and go ahead and put them in my real
05:55 - world without any problems
05:57 - so i can choose and match which ones i
06:00 - want to use maybe i want to use this one
06:02 - so i put it up here and i
06:05 - make it fitting over the other one
06:08 - now a couple of observations is you
06:10 - might want to
06:11 - make them fit in exactly but there is
06:14 - not much of a tr
06:15 - problem as long as you keep it
06:16 - consistent that's why i told you to
06:19 - leave some space
06:20 - between the park and the buildings
06:23 - if i take a look here
06:27 - i calculated around how much space i
06:30 - needed to
06:30 - leave and it's pretty much the same of
06:33 - course you can always rotate it
06:35 - you don't have to make it stay in the
06:38 - same fixed
06:38 - line and you can even make it in the
06:40 - diagonal so that's the problem
06:42 - if you want a more specific angle like
06:44 - than this eight
06:46 - uh it's a gets a little bit more complex
06:49 - it still can be done
06:51 - if you notice each one of these elements
06:53 - it's
06:54 - something we call a modal right
06:58 - a modal is basically a collection of
07:01 - parts
07:02 - that move all together and behave as one
07:04 - single object
07:06 - now if you click on the little arrow
07:08 - next to the modal you can still see that
07:10 - the model is made of different parts
07:12 - and each one of these parts can be
07:13 - modified individually right
07:16 - so for example if i want the lines in
07:17 - the middle to not be yellow anymore
07:19 - you see that this one of these road
07:21 - markings says bright yellow i can change
07:23 - it to white for example
07:24 - i can go with the other one and change
07:26 - it to white again
07:28 - so you say fundamentally change the
07:30 - middle of the line to be
07:31 - yellow this is one of the packages
07:34 - the advantages of this one that i found
07:37 - is that
07:38 - it is pretty simple makes you a very
07:40 - great and unique city
07:42 - however it doesn't have many structures
07:44 - you can pull out
07:46 - roads from that's why even the same road
07:49 - category
07:50 - i found another one which i prefer
07:53 - crafts road pack but i prefer to use
07:56 - road pack
07:57 - two which is
08:01 - version two you see that's significantly
08:05 - bigger
08:06 - but it includes more features and has a
08:08 - different aesthetic
08:09 - so this one it makes my history go a
08:12 - little bit slower because it's a lot of
08:13 - process at the beginning
08:16 - it has the same rules the same like
08:18 - yellow lines in the middle
08:20 - it's it adds some different elements
08:22 - like a little
08:23 - round ending of the road block endings
08:28 - this one which is usually used for
08:29 - several areas of the city parking lots
08:32 - this type of parking lot this type of
08:34 - parking lot over here with a little wall
08:36 - in the
08:37 - edges two bridges
08:40 - and more green sections
08:44 - you can definitely use this one as a
08:45 - base for the city or you can go ahead if
08:47 - you open the
08:48 - road pack you'll find the same division
08:53 - and since it has more of these divisions
08:56 - it's significantly bigger than the
08:58 - traditional road pack
09:00 - that i found over there um
09:03 - you'll have to rotate through all of
09:05 - this to find the one you like
09:07 - but the idea is the same once you found
09:09 - one once you find one
09:12 - that you like oh it's cool the side
09:14 - sorry the name of this one is cool
09:15 - design
09:18 - long straight road medium band bridge
09:20 - bridge two
09:22 - anyone you like you can still duplicate
09:24 - it and
09:25 - i'll grab this bridge too i'll use move
09:28 - tool
09:31 - move tool sorry i click the wrong one
09:34 - and i can bring it down here
09:36 - now this one is actually a little bit
09:38 - bigger
09:40 - now there's one thing you'll notice is
09:42 - that because this one is
09:43 - still inside of the root pack you won't
09:46 - be able to move it freely
09:48 - but you can fix it by dragging it from
09:51 - here
09:52 - in this section of the explorer
09:55 - and drag it just below any of this
09:59 - we'll try not to make it inside another
10:01 - one try to make it
10:03 - inside workspace okay and it will sort
10:06 - it alphabetically again
10:08 - and now since it's no longer part of the
10:11 - package
10:11 - because you duplicate it and you put it
10:13 - outside you can even move it with the
10:14 - select tool and it doesn't change a lot
10:18 - i believe the rows of this one are
10:22 - a little bit bigger than the other one
10:23 - so it's basically up to
10:25 - up to you try not to scale it a lot
10:29 - uh one recommendation i have personally
10:32 - because
10:32 - when you scale it roads stop fitting in
10:36 - with each other as good as you would
10:38 - like them to be
10:39 - and that's just because scaling is not
10:42 - really a precise operation to do
10:44 - so when you scale a road you might find
10:47 - that they don't no longer fit with the
10:48 - other ones you've previously scaled
10:50 - it takes some trial and error to see
10:52 - what's the correct scaling for
10:54 - your roads so you got to be careful with
10:56 - that part as well
10:57 - you see here i can make the bridge fit
10:59 - in here or i can put it down here
11:02 - i can rotate it as well just put this
11:06 - here
11:07 - i only need the green rotator because
11:12 - my city is going to be like in square
11:15 - fashion
11:16 - so i'm going to put this one here
11:20 - i'm going to put some roads
11:23 - like then again i can go here to the
11:26 - crops road pack and drive a straight
11:29 - road
11:30 - over here i can pull it out of the
11:34 - of the crab pack
11:38 - take some time put it in as a part of
11:40 - bridge too but then i'll put it as a
11:42 - part of the workspace
11:44 - now that i have it as part of the
11:45 - workspace
11:48 - i can select it here straight road and
11:50 - just move it outside
11:52 - and there you go that's how you pull the
11:55 - road and
11:55 - once you have it outside you can just
11:58 - keep duplicating this one and keep
11:59 - duplicating the other ones
12:01 - once you're done with the rows you want
12:02 - to place it's pretty easy
12:04 - crop road pack you just delete it
12:07 - and i'm gonna delete the other ones as
12:09 - well because i don't really
12:11 - need them so you can grab they're very
12:14 - recognizable because they're the ones
12:16 - with
12:16 - the specific names of roads now two
12:19 - advantages i found with
12:21 - the crab road pack is that it comes
12:23 - already
12:24 - the models come inside of another model
12:26 - so it's easier to recognize which one
12:29 - belongs to your program which ones
12:30 - doesn't
12:31 - so at the end it's easier to delete and
12:35 - leave them out of your main program you
12:37 - don't need it after you place the
12:38 - entirety of the roads of your
12:40 - city another advantage is that it has
12:43 - more variety
12:45 - and even has a little bit of grass on
12:46 - the on the edges so it looks more
12:49 - nature like of course you can pick from
12:52 - many different road packs but i
12:53 - recommend using road packs for your
12:55 - cities as they already fit in with each
12:57 - other perfectly
12:59 - you can pick them based on the size and
13:01 - you can pick them based on
13:03 - what style of roads you like for the
13:05 - next part
13:06 - i'm going to finish the roads okay i'm
13:09 - going to have the roads finished and
13:10 - we're going to test some vehicles
13:12 - out inside and some recommendations of
13:14 - which vehicles are
13:16 - good to have in a city i hope you
13:18 - enjoyed this project
13:20 - and that's it for today thanks for
13:21 - watching don't remember to hit like and
13:23 - subscribe and i will see you on the next
13:25 - chapter
13:26 - goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys welcome back to first code academy and today we'll continue on our series on how to build a city in roblox in today's video we'll take a look at how to build roads how to set them up in the city and how to design strategically how to build our roads first to place our buildings in a later stage i hope you like this video remember to like and subscribe so for today's chapter i made a couple of changes uh not very major well the first the only change substantial i have made since live chapter was i extended the base plate because i want to play around with some of the road elements we can include into a roblox project the reason i did this is because i don't want to interfere in the main city so what i did was just go into the base plate over here and change the size i kept the height the same 20 but i changed the dimensions to 2 000 and 2 000 this is not permanent of course and remember in the end i will get rid of the base plate but for now i'm just going to leave it like that because i want to place the temporary elements there and play around with the road placements first to then show you what it's going to look like in the end now before i do anything else i will do to do something so i don't get confused in the future it's good practice that if you are going to make a new project and you want certain parts of the world to be unique or to differentiate them from the other parts to rename them so you can click again on the name here and i'm going to change this one to the not really a base plate again but i'm going to rename it as just base right uh this is so in the future when i get rid of the base plate i can extend this make it thicker so it looks more like an actual base element of the floor you know uh another good reason to do this to make it thicker it's something called clipping and in video games clipping means when your character moves at a certain speed or in certain angles so that the program fails to calculate in its next position and imagine here is a wall and here's your character and sometimes you gain certain speed at a certain angle and then the game calculates as if it passed through the wall without like hitting the wall exactly in the matter of fraction of a second it is this is pretty rare but it might happen and it will lead to some like weird behaviors in your game so usually you want them to be thick enough so that no matter if it goes like really fast the next position will be inside the wall and the game will know to push it back and not let it go through now with that out of the way i'm going to start by going to the pack texture packs right and you see if you type in road there's many individual elements and those are fine these are great but i prefer packs okay there's two i will recommend and i'll play around and see the difference between both of them first one is a road pack so i'll go straight up here and this road pack is probably one of the most popular ones uh it's main characteristics are that it includes multiple sections of straight roads right some of these roads include like a middle part with the park some other just like a straight line and you can see that it divides it into a grid of four by four so if you hover your mouse like in the select option over many of these you will see that it's four across and four above when you paste them into the world each one will have its own individual name and so you can see that they all priority priority of threeway fourway intersections these are intersections that are these are these four intersections these four straight rows these are straight rows with park and these are curves and other type of intersection now what's the mean difference well these two i consider them are pretty much the same just road road oh yeah the main difference between these two this one is has a driveway so if you want to put a house in here this is a good spot to park the car and the intersections are basically just very well described this is four ways of four cars like cars can go from front four directions and here they can go from three directions in case you want to intersect the road only at one spot these two their main difference is just uh fourway stop and threeway stops instead of using headlights it uses the stop signs same as here so fourway threeway priority the priority one means that the road that has the yellow stripes it's tends to be bigger than the road that comes from the other intersections so one of the roads has priority of way so grow cars that come from the yellow lines will usually well in the real world drive first and the other ones will stop to see if nobody else is coming right the advantage of road packs is for example you can leave it outside of your main world and to manipulate it and you can always use the duplicate function so i can duplicate here and it will create a new copy which i can select and move and the advantage of using road packs is that i can leave them all here and go ahead and put them in my real world without any problems so i can choose and match which ones i want to use maybe i want to use this one so i put it up here and i make it fitting over the other one now a couple of observations is you might want to make them fit in exactly but there is not much of a tr problem as long as you keep it consistent that's why i told you to leave some space between the park and the buildings if i take a look here i calculated around how much space i needed to leave and it's pretty much the same of course you can always rotate it you don't have to make it stay in the same fixed line and you can even make it in the diagonal so that's the problem if you want a more specific angle like than this eight uh it's a gets a little bit more complex it still can be done if you notice each one of these elements it's something we call a modal right a modal is basically a collection of parts that move all together and behave as one single object now if you click on the little arrow next to the modal you can still see that the model is made of different parts and each one of these parts can be modified individually right so for example if i want the lines in the middle to not be yellow anymore you see that this one of these road markings says bright yellow i can change it to white for example i can go with the other one and change it to white again so you say fundamentally change the middle of the line to be yellow this is one of the packages the advantages of this one that i found is that it is pretty simple makes you a very great and unique city however it doesn't have many structures you can pull out roads from that's why even the same road category i found another one which i prefer crafts road pack but i prefer to use road pack two which is version two you see that's significantly bigger but it includes more features and has a different aesthetic so this one it makes my history go a little bit slower because it's a lot of process at

for several areas of the city parking lots this type of parking lot this type of parking lot over here with a little wall in the edges two bridges and more green sections you can definitely use this one as a base for the city or you can go ahead if you open the road pack you'll find the same division and since it has more of these divisions it's significantly bigger than the traditional road pack that i found over there um you'll have to rotate through all of this to find the one you like but the idea is the same once you found one once you find one that you like oh it's cool the side sorry the name of this one is cool design long straight road medium band bridge bridge two anyone you like you can still duplicate it and i'll grab this bridge too i'll use move tool move tool sorry i click the wrong one and i can bring it down here now this one is actually a little bit bigger now there's one thing you'll notice is that because this one is still inside of the root pack you won't be able

you might find that they don't no longer fit with the other ones you've previously scaled it takes some trial and error to see what's the correct scaling for your roads so you got to be careful with that part as well you see here i can make the bridge fit in here or i can put it down here i can rotate it as well just put this here i only need the green rotator because my city is going to be like in square fashion so i'm going to put this one here i'm going to put some roads like then again i can go here to the crops road pack and drive a straight road over here i can pull it out of the of the crab pack take some time put it in as a part of bridge too but then i'll put it as a part of the workspace now that i have it as part of the workspace i can select it here straight road and just move

to your program which ones doesn't so at the end it's easier to delete and leave them out of your main program you don't need it after you place the entirety of the roads of your city another advantage is that it has more variety and even has a little bit of grass on the on the edges so it looks more nature like of course you can pick from many different road packs but i recommend using road packs for your cities as they already fit in with each other perfectly you can pick them based on the size and you can pick them based on what style of roads you like for the next part i'm going to finish the roads okay i'm going to have the roads finished and we're going to test some vehicles out inside and some recommendations of which vehicles are good to have in a city i hope you enjoyed this project and that's it for today thanks for watching don't remember to hit like and subscribe and i will see you on the next chapter goodbye
