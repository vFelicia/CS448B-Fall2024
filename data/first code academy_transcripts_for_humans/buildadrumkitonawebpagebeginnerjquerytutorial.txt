00:02 - hello everyone
00:03 - welcome back to our channel here is your
00:05 - big dinner friendly coding tutorials in
00:07 - scratch
00:08 - roblox minecraft programming and many
00:10 - more
00:11 - so today we are going to create a
00:12 - keyboard drum set with jquery
00:15 - well in this project you can see that
00:17 - we're using
00:19 - the drum set and then there's like a
00:21 - several instructions for how
00:23 - we produce sounds for this drum for
00:26 - example q is for crash
00:27 - so when i press q
00:31 - the sound will produce so before we
00:34 - start i just want to let you know that
00:36 - jquery is the library
00:38 - that's part of the javascript that does
00:40 - everything is reading and drop
00:42 - short form so let's get started
00:45 - so we'll begin by opening up the
00:47 - template of the project
00:48 - as you may notice html and the css
00:53 - so these and these
00:56 - has already been completed for us and
00:58 - some part of the jquery
01:00 - so we don't have to worry about the
01:02 - variables for a different
01:04 - uh sound produce well in this for time
01:08 - we're just going to look at a keyboard
01:09 - event
01:10 - and this will inform us in pressing a
01:12 - button and playing it sound
01:15 - so the first thing we have to do
01:18 - i'm just going to hide my html and css
01:22 - and go back to js so we have the
01:25 - variable
01:26 - and we're going to create some of the
01:29 - constants
01:30 - well we'll be using the contents since
01:32 - the values
01:33 - which is the sound of different keys we
01:35 - remain constant
01:37 - so it would it won't change uh for the
01:40 - sound
01:40 - whenever we press the key button so
01:43 - that's constant
01:44 - so let's do seven of those keys so
01:47 - constant constant
01:52 - q equals to 81 and
01:55 - constant a equals to 65
01:58 - constant s equals 83
02:02 - constant d equals to
02:06 - 68
02:09 - and constant f
02:12 - equals 270
02:16 - and constant t equals to
02:19 - 84 and constant x
02:23 - equals to 88 awesome so now
02:26 - we created all of these constant
02:28 - variables
02:30 - so the way to type it is in javascript
02:32 - where jquery is
02:33 - called constant c-o-n-s-t so this is a
02:37 - way of declaring a constant variable
02:39 - type
02:40 - well type in these seven constants
02:44 - while each constant to have should have
02:46 - a letter corresponding to the front page
02:48 - of the instructions
02:50 - so this number inside of values is the
02:53 - key code we have to add
02:54 - check if you want to find out more of
02:56 - that
02:57 - you can check out on keycode.info to
02:59 - check the corresponding keycode
03:01 - to each letter so all right so moving on
03:05 - we finish our first step and we are
03:08 - going to our second step
03:10 - as you can see that there is like
03:13 - the document.keydown function event so
03:16 - this is the
03:17 - down effect function which will perform
03:20 - some of the
03:21 - functions uh which is produce the sound
03:24 - and some animated effects for our
03:27 - keys so whenever we press the key button
03:29 - it will reduce
03:31 - the sound for the corresponding key and
03:33 - then
03:34 - well there are some other things that we
03:36 - do which is like
03:37 - we will change our title to
03:41 - h3 and we will going to animate
03:44 - the image to reduce the dramatic effect
03:46 - so whenever we press the key button
03:48 - it will pop it will kind of move up and
03:51 - down
03:52 - a little bit or enlarge a little bit
03:55 - so it kind of tells us that this is
03:57 - working
03:58 - like that so we have seven keys
04:01 - um we're going to start by
04:05 - creating the first key which is q
04:08 - so first of all we will
04:13 - start by giving it a condition
04:16 - so if defend which
04:19 - equals to q which means
04:22 - if the key we pressed is actually the
04:26 - key
04:26 - q so the thing we want to do
04:31 - uh we have three things i want to do so
04:33 - the first thing
04:35 - of course playing the sound so crash dot
04:38 - play
04:40 - which is the first function second one
04:43 - is
04:44 - we were going to use jquery so the
04:46 - dollar sign
04:48 - and then we're going to get the element
04:50 - img
04:51 - and dot anyway
04:57 - and we're going to set the width
05:00 - to 3
05:04 - 40 for this one so it kind of changed
05:08 - the width for this
05:15 - all right so we're just going to set the
05:18 - speed of this or the duration of this
05:21 - we're just going to set it to 20 so it's
05:23 - just going to move very quickly
05:25 - and i we are going to animate
05:30 - another width
05:33 - 350
05:43 - [Music]
05:48 - 20 as well so this is the animation for
05:51 - the size
05:52 - of our image the next one we're going to
05:54 - do
05:55 - uh we're just going to set our title to
05:58 - h3
05:59 - as we said before so let's just
06:02 - get the element h3 and then dot html
06:09 - and then crash
06:15 - button pressed
06:19 - so you kind of indicate that oh we
06:22 - press the crush button
06:25 - oh yep
06:28 - all right so this is the keep eq
06:31 - now we can move on to finish the six of
06:35 - them
06:36 - yeah so for
06:41 - the other one
06:46 - which is a
06:51 - we did the condition right now and then
06:53 - we're going to change it to low tom
06:55 - delay and
07:02 - making the elements of the image again
07:04 - we're going to animate it again
07:12 - and then working to 35.
07:16 - oh and then we're going to
07:20 - take it to 20 as well and then animate
07:25 - and factory
07:36 - and 20 again and then the third thing
07:39 - we're going to do is change it to
07:41 - h3 again
07:46 - and then share now
07:54 - low tom
08:03 - as you can see now we finished two of
08:06 - the keys one of
08:07 - them is q and then the second one is
08:09 - eight so as you can see that actually
08:12 - both of them have really really similar
08:14 - codes right
08:15 - so after i will press
08:19 - each of these keys uh it will play some
08:22 - sound
08:23 - and then it will change our image
08:25 - animation
08:26 - and then we're going to change our title
08:30 - h3 title to something pressed
08:33 - so the like which part of the drum
08:37 - is being pressed or being played so
08:41 - okay so the one thing we can actually do
08:44 - uh in this project we can actually
08:47 - copy and paste for
08:54 - three four five six we're going to
08:58 - copy for five more times so
09:01 - so the only thing that is changing
09:02 - actually in this part
09:04 - well i'm just going to underline it with
09:07 - the color
09:08 - pink so the first thing we is
09:11 - different is the queue and then
09:15 - the second thing is play
09:18 - something to something of the elements
09:21 - play
09:22 - and then we're just going to stick with
09:24 - the
09:25 - uh width uh for each of the animation
09:29 - and then the third thing is changing is
09:33 - the low tom and then the crash button
09:36 - which is the
09:37 - h3 of the start of the h2
09:40 - so three of these things only have like
09:43 - only difference from each other so the
09:45 - rest of our
09:46 - key buttons we will just change all of
09:49 - them
09:50 - with their corresponding sound and their
09:53 - corresponding
09:53 - letter so for the third one is actually
09:56 - s
09:57 - so s represents the time
10:00 - so and then i'm just going to change it
10:04 - to mid
10:06 - top okay
10:09 - and then the fourth one is actually d
10:13 - so d represents
10:16 - hi tom
10:19 - and we're going to change the high tom
10:24 - for the next one the f
10:28 - which is
10:31 - snare and then
10:40 - and then the last second last one
10:43 - is t and then which is
10:47 - high hat so changes
10:50 - hi hats
10:56 - and then the last one is x which has
10:59 - the kick
11:07 - and then your shoulders kick drum button
11:09 - first
11:11 - and basically that's it so
11:15 - well after we finish all of these you
11:17 - can actually try it out
11:18 - so we're just going to separate all of
11:21 - this again
11:21 - and then all right
11:24 - so here we go you can see our drum
11:27 - stretch that
11:28 - we're going to try it out again right
11:29 - now
11:31 - okay okay when i press a
11:35 - the low time is pressed and then when i
11:37 - press s
11:39 - the top and then for d high top and then
11:43 - for f
11:44 - snare and then for t i hat
11:48 - and then for x kick drum so that's it
11:51 - so basically that's all the things that
11:53 - we have to do
11:55 - well so that's it for today in this
11:57 - tutorial we created a drum kit with the
11:59 - use of jquery
12:00 - while jquery is a mini library for
12:02 - javascript which allows you to write
12:04 - code but in a more quicker and
12:06 - simplified way
12:07 - so hope you like this video don't forget

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to our channel here is your big dinner friendly coding tutorials in scratch roblox minecraft programming and many more so today we are going to create a keyboard drum set with jquery well in this project you can see that we're using the drum set and then there's like a several instructions for how we produce sounds for this drum for example q is for crash so when i press q the sound will produce so before we start i just want to let you know that jquery is the library that's part of the javascript that does everything is reading and drop short form so let's get started so we'll begin by opening up the template of the project as you may notice html and the css so these and these has already been completed for us and some part of the jquery so we don't have to worry about the variables for a different uh sound produce well in this for time we're just going to look at a keyboard event and this will inform us in pressing a button and playing it sound so the first thing we have to do i'm just going to hide my html and css and go back to js so we have the variable and we're going to create some of the constants well we'll be using the contents since the values which is the sound of different keys we remain constant so it would it won't change uh for the sound whenever we press the key button so that's constant so let's do seven of those keys so constant constant q equals to 81 and constant a equals to 65 constant s equals 83 constant d equals to 68 and constant f equals 270 and constant t equals to 84 and constant x equals to 88 awesome so now we created all of these constant variables so the way to type it is in javascript where jquery is called constant const so this is a way of declaring a constant variable type well type in these seven constants while each constant to have should have a letter corresponding to the front page of the instructions so this number inside of values is the key code we have to add check if you want to find out more of that you can check out on keycode.info to check the corresponding keycode to each letter so all right so moving on we finish our first step and we are going to our second step as you can see that there is like the document.keydown function event so this is the down effect function which will perform some of the functions uh which is produce the sound and some animated effects for our keys so whenever we press the key button it will reduce the sound for the corresponding key and then well there are some other things that we do which is like we will change our title to h3 and we will going to animate the image to reduce the dramatic effect so whenever we press the key button it will pop it will kind of move up and down a little bit or enlarge a little bit so it kind of tells us that this is working like that so we have seven keys um we're going to start by creating the first key which is q so first of all we will start by giving it a condition so if defend which equals to q which means if the key we pressed is actually the key q so the thing we want to do uh we have three things i want to do so the first thing of course playing the sound so crash dot play which is the first function second one is we were going to use jquery so the dollar sign and then we're going to get the element img and dot anyway and we're going to set the width to 3 40 for this one so it kind of changed the width for this all right so we're just going to set the speed of this or the duration of this we're just going to set it to 20 so it's just going to move very quickly and i we are going to animate another width 350 20 as well so this is the animation for the size of our image the next one we're going to do uh we're just going to set our title to h3 as we said before so let's just get the element h3 and then dot html and then crash button pressed so you kind of indicate that oh we press the crush button oh yep all right so this is the keep eq now we can move on to finish the six of them yeah so for the other one which is a we did the condition right now and then we're going to change it to low tom delay and making the elements of the image again we're going to animate it again and then working to 35. oh and then we're going to take it to 20 as well and then animate and factory and 20 again and then the third thing we're going to do is change it to h3 again and then share now low tom as you can see now we finished two of the keys one of them is q and then the second one is eight so as you can see that actually both of them have really really similar codes right so after i will press each of these keys uh it will play some sound and then it will change our image animation and then we're going to change our title h3 title to something pressed so the like which part of the drum is being pressed or being played so okay so the one thing we can actually do uh in this project we can actually copy and paste for three four five six we're going to copy for five more times so so the only thing that is changing actually in this part well i'm just going to underline it with the color pink so the first thing we is different is the queue and then the second thing is play something to something of the elements play and then we're just going to stick with the uh width uh for each of the animation and then the third thing is changing is the low tom and then the crash button which is the h3 of the start of the h2 so three of these things only have like only difference from each other so the rest of our key buttons we will just change all of them with their corresponding sound and their corresponding letter so for the third one is actually s so s represents the time so and then i'm just going to change it to mid top okay and then the fourth one is actually d so d represents hi tom and we're going to change the high tom for the next one the f which is snare and then and then the last second last one is t and then which is high hat so changes hi hats and then the last one is x which has the kick and then your shoulders kick drum button first and basically that's it so well after we finish all of these you can actually try it out so we're just going to separate all of this again and then all right so here we go you can see our drum stretch that we're going to try it out again right now okay okay when i press a the low time is pressed and then when i press s the top and then for d high top and then for f snare and then for t i hat and then for x kick drum so that's it so basically that's all the things that we have to do well so that's it for today in this tutorial we created a drum kit with the use of jquery while jquery is a mini library for javascript which allows you to write code but in a more quicker and simplified way so hope
