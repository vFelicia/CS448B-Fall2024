00:00 - hello everyone welcome to first code
00:03 - academy
00:04 - today we are going to make a simple
00:05 - project on apple vertical
00:08 - pumpkin and turkey smash
00:11 - ok and turkey bash is a simple thing in
00:14 - which
00:15 - a party and a turkey pop-ups randomly on
00:18 - the screen
00:19 - and when you try to touch it you'll gain
00:21 - points
00:29 - one point for a pumpkin and five points
00:31 - for the turkey
00:32 - if you miss touching the pumpkin or the
00:35 - turkey
00:36 - it will be counted as a mess
00:41 - by pressing on the mixer button the
00:43 - count of the hits
00:44 - and misses would be visit back to see
00:49 - by building this game you will learn how
00:51 - to add timing
00:52 - random randomness and use procedures
00:55 - into your apps
00:58 - so let's start by giving a name to our
01:00 - project
01:01 - so the name of this project would be
01:03 - called pumpkin and techie smash
01:16 - so let's start with designing our
01:18 - project
01:19 - i have already added the pictures and
01:22 - the sounds that i'll be using for the
01:24 - project
01:25 - you can find the links to these pictures
01:27 - and the sound
01:29 - by clicking on the description below
01:33 - so first let's add our very first
01:35 - component that is a canvas
01:37 - so i'm going to go ahead and drag a
01:40 - canvas onto the screen
01:42 - so we are going to use a canvas to hold
01:44 - our turkey
01:45 - and our pumpkins price so i'm going to
01:49 - make the canvas
01:51 - and i'm going to change the height we
01:53 - fill paren
01:55 - and the width is going to be fill parent
01:58 - 2.
02:00 - next i'm going to add 2 image press
02:11 - i'm going to rename each image price
02:14 - in order to help me to identify the
02:17 - pictures
02:17 - when i'm coding i'm going to rename the
02:21 - first image spread as
02:23 - turkey
02:28 - and the second image right i'll be
02:30 - renaming it as
02:34 - okay
02:36 - all right so next i'm going to add two
02:39 - horizontal arrangements that will be
02:41 - showing
02:41 - us of his code and our mrs score
02:45 - so now i'm going to go to layout and i'm
02:49 - going to add
02:50 - one horizontal orange one
02:54 - next i'm going to add a label
02:59 - i'm going to rename this label as
03:02 - heat label
03:08 - next i'm going to add another label onto
03:10 - the
03:11 - horizontal measurement which i'm going
03:15 - to rename
03:16 - as hit come
03:23 - good next i'm going to change the
03:26 - properties
03:26 - of these two labels so i'm going to go
03:29 - ahead
03:30 - click on the hit label and i'm going to
03:32 - change the text of this hit label to be
03:35 - hit
03:40 - and i'm going to change the property or
03:43 - the text
03:44 - of the hit count to be zero
03:51 - next i'm going to repeat the same
03:53 - procedure
03:54 - to add a label to hold my mrs cap
03:58 - i'm going to go ahead and click on a
04:01 - horizontal arrangement
04:08 - next i'm going to add two
04:12 - labels
04:18 - i'm going to rename this label as
04:21 - mislabel
04:26 - the second label i would be meaning in
04:28 - it as
04:31 - miss
04:36 - so the text for the miss label would be
04:40 - called this is
04:43 - and the x for the miscount would be
04:47 - zero so next i'm going to add
04:51 - a reset button into a screen so
04:54 - in order to do that i'm going to bring a
04:57 - button
04:58 - that will be at the very bottom of my
05:00 - screen
05:02 - which i will be renaming it as
05:06 - reset button
05:10 - i'm going to change the text of this
05:12 - button to be
05:14 - called reset
05:20 - next i'm going to add a sub component
05:22 - that will be holding my
05:24 - sun
05:28 - so i'm going to go ahead and click on
05:30 - media
05:32 - and then i'm going to drag this sound
05:33 - component
05:37 - here i'm going to change the source of
05:39 - the sound component to be
05:41 - to be more sub
05:48 - so next i'm going to add two clock
05:50 - sensors
05:51 - into my app screen which will be
05:54 - representing the timing components
05:56 - for the turkey and the pumpkin
06:00 - so let's click on the sensors
06:04 - and let's bring two clock sensors onto
06:07 - the screen
06:09 - clock one and clock two so i'm going to
06:12 - re
06:13 - rename one clock as
06:18 - turkey
06:24 - and the second clock would be meaning as
06:33 - now once we have radiant clocks and all
06:36 - other components we need to add the
06:38 - pictures
06:39 - onto our image price so let's go ahead
06:42 - and click on the turkey image prime
06:45 - and click on the picture properties
06:49 - and click on the turkey picture
06:56 - now it's really big so in order to
06:58 - resize it i will be
07:00 - changing the height of the turkey image
07:03 - prime to be
07:05 - 50 pixels
07:09 - and width is also going to be 50 pixels
07:15 - so next i'm going to add the image of
07:17 - the pumpkin sprite
07:25 - which i'll be changing the height to be
07:27 - 50 pixels
07:32 - and with also going to be 50 pixels
07:38 - all right so now once we have done with
07:42 - designing our app next we are going on
07:44 - to the
07:45 - codes so let's go ahead and click on the
07:48 - blocks
07:49 - now that we have created our mobile app
07:52 - screen
07:53 - next we are going to create the code
07:55 - blocks
07:57 - first we need to create two procedures
07:59 - that would make our image
08:01 - price to move randomly on our screen
08:05 - so i'm going to click on procedures and
08:08 - i'm going to drag
08:09 - do procedure duplo
08:13 - the first procedure would move our
08:15 - pumpkin
08:17 - so i'm going to rename the procedure
08:19 - need to be
08:27 - next i'm going to click on the pumpkin
08:29 - image sprite
08:30 - and i'm going to bring the inbuilt
08:33 - procedure that is called
08:36 - pumpkin dot move to xn1
08:39 - and then i'm going to snap them together
08:43 - the value x and y belongs to a system
08:46 - called coordinate system which help us
08:49 - to determine the position of an
08:51 - object on the script x stands for the
08:55 - left and right
08:56 - and y stands for the up and down
08:58 - position
09:01 - so in order to give the random x and y
09:03 - coordinates i'm going to click on
09:05 - the math block and i'm going to drag
09:09 - in the block called random integer 1 to
09:12 - 100
09:16 - i'm going to make this to be 0
09:20 - and i'm going to remove the 100 block
09:23 - and put it on the trash bin
09:26 - so next in order to keep our image right
09:30 - appear within the screen i'm going to
09:32 - consider the canvas width
09:34 - together with the size of my image
09:36 - spread
09:37 - so i'm going to go ahead and click on
09:39 - the math block
09:41 - and i'm going to drag in the subtraction
09:43 - block
09:44 - onto the empty gap
09:48 - next i'm going to click on the canvas
09:50 - one
09:52 - and i'm going to bring the property
09:56 - block
09:57 - that is canvas one dot web
10:04 - which is going to be subtracted by
10:10 - the pumpkin wood
10:16 - i'm going to repeat the same procedure
10:18 - for the y
10:20 - but instead of the width i'm going to
10:22 - consider the height of the canvas
10:24 - subtracted by the height of my pumpkin
10:30 - spray
10:32 - i'm going to go ahead and drag in the
10:33 - random integer block
10:36 - and snap them together and y
10:39 - make this zero and i'm going to drag the
10:43 - 100 block
10:49 - next i'm going to drag in the
10:50 - subtraction block
10:53 - inside it
10:56 - and this time i'm going to drag
10:59 - canvas dot height property block
11:03 - that is going to be subtracted with
11:06 - the pumpkin height
11:15 - so that's the first procedure so next
11:18 - i'm going to repeat the same
11:20 - steps to make the procedure that would
11:23 - move your
11:24 - turkey spray i'm going to create
11:27 - another procedure so i'm going to drag
11:30 - in two procedure
11:32 - and i'm going to rename it as move
11:36 - turkey next i'm going to click on the
11:40 - turkey image sprite and i'm going to
11:42 - bring the
11:43 - in build procedure block called
11:46 - call turkey dot move to xny
11:51 - so next i'm going to click on the map
11:53 - blocks and i'm going to drag it random
11:56 - integer 1 to
11:57 - 100 i'm going to change this to the 0
12:01 - and i'm going to drag the 100 block into
12:03 - the trash bin
12:06 - next i'm going to drag in the
12:07 - subtraction block
12:12 - and i'm going to consider the canvas
12:14 - width
12:22 - which is going to be subtracted by the
12:25 - width of the
12:26 - turkey image prime
12:34 - so same goes for the coordinates so i'm
12:37 - going to bring
12:39 - random integer make it zero
12:52 - and then i'm going to consider the
12:55 - height of my cameras
13:00 - and together the
13:04 - height of the turkey
13:11 - so now once we have created the two
13:14 - procedures that would make our pumpkin
13:16 - and the turkey to
13:17 - appear at random places on the screen we
13:20 - need to
13:21 - call them when we open up the screen and
13:24 - when the time is running
13:26 - i'm going to go ahead and click on the
13:28 - turkey cup
13:30 - and bring the event block called
13:32 - winterguitar
13:34 - timer and i'm going to call the
13:37 - procedure
13:39 - paul moog turkey
13:43 - same goes for the pumpkin cloth so when
13:45 - i i'm going to click on the pumpkin
13:48 - crop dot timer so i'm going to call the
13:53 - new pumpkin procedure
13:58 - next we need to make sure that just two
14:01 - procedures would be
14:02 - running or would be functioning when we
14:04 - open up the screen
14:06 - so i'm going to go ahead and click on
14:08 - the screen one component
14:10 - and i'm going to add the even block that
14:13 - is called
14:14 - one screen one dot initialize to
14:17 - and then i'm going to add the two
14:19 - procedures called
14:22 - pumpkin and moon turkey
14:28 - so next i'm going to program the miss
14:31 - and the hit instructions so i'm going to
14:35 - click on
14:37 - the canvas and i'm going to bring the
14:40 - event block on when canvas dot
14:46 - so in this step i'm going to program
14:49 - that
14:50 - if you don't hit any of the image price
14:53 - you would get your
14:55 - mrs go increase so i'm going to add a
14:58 - conditional
15:00 - if that
15:03 - and i'm going to add a logic not
15:07 - and which would be adding the variable
15:13 - touched any sprite so if
15:16 - i don't touch any of the image price
15:19 - i'm going to make my miscount
15:23 - text to be increasing one by one
15:26 - so i'm going to click on the miss count
15:28 - block and i'm going to bring
15:31 - the property block called set
15:33 - miscount.text
15:37 - which is going to add
15:41 - one count
15:49 - let's count
15:55 - one so now i'm going to make the chord
15:58 - knot
15:58 - that would give me the instruction to
16:01 - increase my hit score by one
16:03 - when i click on a pumpkin sprite
16:06 - so i'm going to click on pumpkin and
16:10 - i'm going to pray the event.com
16:14 - onepumpkin.touch
16:17 - next i'm going to click on the hitscope
16:22 - i'm going to bring the property set hit
16:24 - count.text
16:27 - and then i'm going to add one
16:36 - so hit count.text would be changing by
16:40 - a score of one every time when i hit a
16:44 - pumpkin spread
16:47 - next to make it more interesting i'm
16:50 - going to add a little sound
16:53 - that would be plain every time when i
16:55 - click on
16:56 - a pumpkin spray so i'm going to click on
17:00 - the sound block
17:02 - and i'm going to bring the input
17:04 - procedure call
17:06 - cause one dot play
17:09 - so i'm going to repeat the same step
17:12 - such that
17:12 - when you touch a turkish sprite
17:16 - you would get a score of five
17:20 - i'm going to click contact image sprite
17:22 - and i'm going to bring the event block
17:24 - on
17:25 - when turkey dot touch
17:28 - and i'm going to change the hit count
17:36 - by
17:41 - five so hit tell
17:46 - so the cats of the headcount label would
17:49 - be changed by
17:51 - five whenever you hit or whenever you
17:54 - touch
17:54 - a turkey image right i'm going to make
17:58 - it
18:00 - and i'm going to add the sound component
18:03 - so i'm going to bring the inbuilt block
18:06 - on
18:07 - call sound 1.2
18:12 - so now we are going on to the last step
18:14 - of our project
18:16 - so when you click on the reset button
18:18 - the hit count
18:19 - and the discount will be reset back to
18:23 - zero so i'm going to go ahead and click
18:27 - on
18:27 - reset button and i'm going to bring the
18:29 - event call
18:31 - when reset button dot click
18:34 - next i'm going to give the instructions
18:38 - that the hit count text will be
18:42 - reset back to zero so i'm going to add
18:46 - the math block zero
18:50 - and same goes for the miscount so i'm
18:52 - going to add the
18:54 - miscount.text block
18:58 - and it will be changed back to zero
19:02 - whenever you click on the reset button
19:06 - awesome so now we have completed our
19:09 - project
19:10 - for the turkey and pumpkin smashbox
19:15 - go ahead and click on connect and if you
19:19 - have an
19:19 - android phone you may click on the ai

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we are going to make a simple project on apple vertical pumpkin and turkey smash ok and turkey bash is a simple thing in which a party and a turkey popups randomly on the screen and when you try to touch it you'll gain points one point for a pumpkin and five points for the turkey if you miss touching the pumpkin or the turkey it will be counted as a mess by pressing on the mixer button the count of the hits and misses would be visit back to see by building this game you will learn how to add timing random randomness and use procedures into your apps so let's start by giving a name to our project so the name of this project would be called pumpkin and techie smash so let's start with designing our project i have already added the pictures and the sounds that i'll be using for the project you can find the links to these pictures and the sound by clicking on the description below so first let's add our very first component that is a canvas so i'm going to go ahead and drag a canvas onto the screen so we are going to use a canvas to hold our turkey and our pumpkins price so i'm going to make the canvas and i'm going to change the height we fill paren and the width is going to be fill parent 2. next i'm going to add 2 image press i'm going to rename each image price in order to help me to identify the pictures when i'm coding i'm going to rename the first image spread as turkey and the second image right i'll be renaming it as okay all right so next i'm going to add two horizontal arrangements that will be showing us of his code and our mrs score so now i'm going to go to layout and i'm going to add one horizontal orange one next i'm going to add a label i'm going to rename this label as heat label next i'm going to add another label onto the horizontal measurement which i'm going to rename as hit come good next i'm going to change the properties of these two labels so i'm going to go ahead click on the hit label and i'm going to change the text of this hit label to be hit and i'm going to change the property or the text of the hit count to be zero next i'm going to repeat the same procedure to add a label to hold my mrs cap i'm going to go ahead and click on a horizontal arrangement next i'm going to add two labels i'm going to rename this label as mislabel the second label i would be meaning in it as miss so the text for the miss label would be called this is and the x for the miscount would be zero so next i'm going to add a reset button into a screen so in order to do that i'm going to bring a button that will be at the very bottom of my screen which i will be renaming it as reset button i'm going to change the text of this button to be called reset next i'm going to add a sub component that will be holding my sun so i'm going to go ahead and click on media and then i'm going to drag this sound component here i'm going to change the source of the sound component to be to be more sub so next i'm going to add two clock sensors into my app screen which will be representing the timing components for the turkey and the pumpkin so let's click on the sensors and let's bring two clock sensors onto the screen clock one and clock two so i'm going to re rename one clock as turkey and the second clock would be meaning as now once we have radiant clocks and all other components we need to add the pictures onto our image price so let's go ahead and click on the turkey image prime and click on the picture properties and click on the turkey picture now it's really big so in order to resize it i will be changing the height of the turkey image prime to be 50 pixels and width is also going to be 50 pixels so next i'm going to add the image of the pumpkin sprite which i'll be changing the height to be 50 pixels and with also going to be 50 pixels all right so now once we have done with designing our app next we are going on to the codes so let's go ahead and click on the blocks now that we have created our mobile app screen next we are going to create the code blocks first we need to create two procedures that would make our image price to move randomly on our screen so i'm going to click on procedures and i'm going to drag do procedure duplo the first procedure would move our pumpkin so i'm going to rename the procedure need to be next i'm going to click on the pumpkin image sprite and i'm going to bring the inbuilt procedure that is called pumpkin dot move to xn1 and then i'm going to snap them together the value x and y belongs to a system called coordinate system which help us to determine the position of an object on the script x stands for the left and right and y stands for the up and down position so in order to give the random x and y coordinates i'm going to click on the math block and i'm going to drag in the block called random integer 1 to 100 i'm going to make this to be 0 and i'm going to remove the 100 block and put it on the trash bin so next in order to keep our image right appear within the screen i'm going to consider the canvas width together with the size of my image spread so i'm going to go ahead and click on the math block and i'm going to drag in the subtraction block onto the empty gap next i'm going to click on the canvas one and i'm going to bring the property block that is canvas one dot web which is going to be subtracted by the pumpkin wood i'm going to repeat the same procedure for the y but instead of the width i'm going to consider the height of the canvas subtracted by the height of my pumpkin spray i'm going to go ahead and drag in the random integer block and snap them together and y make this zero and i'm going to drag the 100 block next i'm going to drag in the subtraction block inside it and this time i'm going to drag canvas dot height property block that is going to be subtracted with the pumpkin height so that's the first procedure so next i'm going to repeat the same steps to make the procedure that would move your turkey spray i'm going to create another procedure so i'm going to drag in two procedure and i'm going to rename it as move turkey next i'm going to click on the turkey image sprite and i'm going to bring the in build procedure block called call turkey dot move to xny so next i'm going to click on the map blocks and i'm going to drag it random integer 1 to 100 i'm going to change this to the 0 and i'm going to drag the 100 block into the trash bin next i'm going to drag in the subtraction block and i'm going to consider the canvas width which is going to be subtracted by the width of the turkey image prime so same goes for the coordinates so i'm going to bring random integer make it zero and then i'm going to consider the height of my cameras and together the height of the turkey so now once we have created the two procedures that would make our pumpkin and the turkey to appear at random places on the screen we need to call them when we open up the screen and when the time is running i'm going to go ahead and click on the turkey cup and bring the event block called winterguitar timer and i'm going to call the procedure paul moog turkey same goes for the pumpkin cloth so when i i'm going to click on the pumpkin crop dot timer so i'm going to call the new pumpkin procedure next we need to make sure that just two procedures would be running or would be functioning when we open up the screen so i'm going to go ahead and click on the screen one component and i'm going to add the even block that is called one screen one dot initialize to and then i'm going to add the two procedures called pumpkin and moon turkey so next i'm going to program the miss and the hit instructions so i'm going to click on the canvas and i'm going to bring the event block on when canvas dot so in this step i'm going to program that if you don't hit any of the image price you would get your mrs go increase so i'm going to add a conditional if that and i'm going to add a logic not and which would be adding the variable touched any sprite so if i don't touch any of the image price i'm going to make my miscount text to be increasing one by one so i'm going to click on the miss count block and i'm going to bring the property block called set miscount.text which is going to add one count let's count one so now i'm going to make the chord knot that would give me the instruction to increase my hit score by one when i click on a pumpkin sprite so i'm going to click on pumpkin and i'm going to pray the event.com onepumpkin.touch next i'm going to click on the hitscope i'm going to bring the property set hit count.text and then i'm going to add one so hit count.text would be changing by a score of one every time when i hit a pumpkin
