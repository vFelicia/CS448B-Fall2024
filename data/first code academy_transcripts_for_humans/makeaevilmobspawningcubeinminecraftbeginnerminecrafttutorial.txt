00:06 - app inventory thunkable minecraft roblox
00:09 - and much more
00:10 - so in today's video we're going to look
00:12 - at how we can make an evil mob
00:14 - in minecraft with the use of m creator
00:17 - so let's begin this project utilizes
00:20 - artificial intelligence
00:22 - to have our mob i think for itself
00:25 - we're also going to design a block for
00:27 - it to spawn
00:29 - we're also going to learn about how we
00:30 - can make use of ticks to have them
00:32 - spawn on top of our blocks and with the
00:36 - use of ai we're going to have these mobs
00:38 - look at us and then attack us so let's
00:40 - look at how this project is going to
00:42 - look like
00:44 - so now we're going to begin our project
00:46 - first of all please open m creator
00:48 - as we'll be designing and coding our
00:50 - project here
00:52 - to begin with we click with the plus
00:54 - sign over here
00:55 - and then click on living entity as i've
00:58 - used the name evil mog
01:00 - here i can use evil mob
01:04 - or i can use evil zombie
01:10 - then we click on create new living
01:12 - entity
01:13 - once we're here we have an entity model
01:16 - we're going to leave it at bypad
01:19 - here we have a name of an entity
01:22 - the next part it asks is the texture of
01:24 - the entity
01:25 - this means say what will our character
01:27 - look like
01:29 - right now i have three over here but as
01:32 - we're making a new one
01:34 - i'd like you all to head to open your
01:37 - browser
01:38 - on google chrome and we'll have a page
01:41 - here called pixel art
01:43 - and what happens with this is we want to
01:46 - create an image which is 16 by 16.
01:49 - so you can click on create new drawing
01:51 - and click ok
01:53 - once we're here i have an image
01:56 - of a character which i've downloaded
02:00 - i will click on file click on open image
02:04 - and then i will select this image here
02:08 - so click on ok so
02:11 - once that's done over here i've added
02:13 - this image but if you notice
02:14 - it's a bit too complex
02:18 - and put on side so what we're going to
02:21 - do is we're going to click on resize
02:23 - and we're going to change this to 16 by
02:26 - 16
02:26 - and then it's going to resize this
02:28 - drawing now this is what comes up
02:31 - you can take in any image and just
02:32 - resize it to 16 by 16
02:35 - and then you can color it inside so i'm
02:38 - going to use
02:39 - a different bunch of colors
02:48 - select any colors you like in this color
02:50 - in
02:56 - once that's done you can click on file
02:58 - and then download
03:01 - here make sure the width and height is
03:02 - 16 by 16 and then click on download png
03:07 - and then here you can just place this
03:11 - back here and then change the name so
03:14 - you can put
03:14 - zombie make sure it's dot png
03:19 - once we're done we can just minimize
03:20 - this window here and then we can click
03:23 - on plus
03:24 - find our image from the desktop
03:29 - and then click on zombie once that's
03:33 - done you'll see
03:34 - your image over here
03:39 - next we can click on behavior make sure
03:42 - it's set to mod
03:44 - and then we need to give it an item so
03:47 - here we click on this
03:48 - type in x i'll given hey diamond
03:52 - x next we click on particles
03:55 - we don't have to add anything over here
03:57 - and we click on inventory we don't have
03:59 - to add anything over here
04:02 - then click on triggers we'll be looking
04:04 - at this section a bit later on
04:07 - and then we click on ai and goals so
04:09 - make sure you enable the ai
04:11 - for the ability for our entity to think
04:16 - here for entity base we're going to
04:18 - change this to zombie
04:20 - next over here as we see the tasks
04:22 - higher on the list have a higher
04:24 - priority
04:25 - this is first second third fourth and
04:27 - fifth
04:29 - what we can do is change things over
04:31 - here
04:32 - by bringing this up clicking on combat
04:35 - tasks
04:36 - and then taking out attack placing this
04:39 - here
04:39 - and we can check only inside and nearby
04:43 - then we can click again to see if
04:46 - anything extra we want to add
04:50 - if we're done adding we can click and
04:53 - move this back over here
04:56 - and click on spawning to see if
04:59 - anything's missing
05:01 - so after we're done we can click on save
05:03 - mod
05:04 - element so evil zombie is done over here
05:08 - next we want to make in a block so we're
05:10 - going to click on this
05:12 - and click on block and we're going to
05:14 - call this the
05:16 - evil zombie
05:19 - block click on create new block
05:24 - so for this we need also a texture
05:27 - what i would suggest is heading back to
05:29 - pixel art
05:30 - over here and creating a new image
05:34 - file new click reload
05:38 - just make sure that the picture is 16 by
05:40 - 16.

05:54 - the height
05:55 - once that's done click on new drawing
05:58 - click on ok
06:00 - so now we just have to make the pattern
06:03 - of the block

06:58 - is single texture and then we leave
07:01 - these items
07:02 - here so we leave this we
07:06 - change the properties so the material
07:08 - we're going to use
07:09 - is iron and the block sound here we're
