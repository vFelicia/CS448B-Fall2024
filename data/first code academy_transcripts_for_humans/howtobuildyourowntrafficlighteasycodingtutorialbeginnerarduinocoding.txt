00:00 - hello everyone welcome to first code
00:03 - academy
00:04 - today we are going to make a traffic
00:06 - light circuit
00:07 - using arduino in this project i'll be
00:11 - using
00:11 - arduino uno and some hardware components
00:14 - to build up the traffic light circuit
00:17 - and to code the program i'll be using
00:20 - the software m
00:22 - you may find the link to download the
00:24 - software mbot
00:25 - in the description box below all right
00:28 - the components that we would need to
00:30 - build up the traffic light circuit
00:32 - would be an arduino uno with the
00:34 - connector cable
00:36 - three 220 ohm resistors
00:40 - one breadboard three colored
00:43 - ladies with red yellow
00:46 - green colors each representing a traffic
00:49 - light
00:49 - color and finally we would need some
00:53 - jumper os
00:56 - so let's go ahead and see how we can
00:58 - build the circuit
00:59 - and program it
01:02 - all right once we have getted all our
01:04 - hardware components
01:06 - let's go ahead and build our traffic
01:08 - light circuit
01:10 - first i'll be using a breadboard
01:13 - which i'm going to use as my base plate
01:16 - to build up my circuit
01:19 - next i'm going to set up my three
01:21 - colored led lights on my breadboard
01:25 - first i'll be using a breadboard which
01:27 - is going to be my
01:28 - baseplate to build up my circuit
01:32 - next i'm going to set up my leds
01:36 - led stands for light emitting
01:39 - they are light up just like mini bombs
01:41 - when electricity is powered
01:44 - and led have two legs one leg
01:47 - is longer than the other the longer leg
01:50 - is known as the anode
01:52 - which is also our positive leg the
01:55 - shorter leg is known as
01:56 - cathode which is the negative leg
02:00 - so i'm going to spread my legs a little
02:03 - bit further apart
02:05 - and i'm going to place my longer lid on
02:08 - my right hand side and the shorter leg
02:10 - on my
02:11 - left hand side
02:24 - so next i'm going to use my yellow led
02:31 - i'm going to spread them out like that
02:36 - and i'm going to place my shorter leg on
02:38 - my left hand side
02:39 - and the longer leg on my right hand side
02:53 - same goes for my green led
03:10 - so once i have set up my leds on my
03:13 - breadboard
03:14 - next i'm going to use resistors to
03:16 - control the amount of electricity
03:19 - that is passing along each route
03:22 - so i'm going to connect one end of the
03:25 - resistor
03:26 - to the negative side of the led
03:33 - like that and the other end of the
03:35 - resistor
03:36 - i'm going to connect to the negative
03:38 - rail of the breadboard
03:41 - so i can connect to any negative
03:45 - on the breadboard
03:51 - like that so i'm going to repeat
03:55 - the same steps for all other two leds
04:00 - i'm going to connect one end of the
04:02 - resistor to the negative
04:05 - leg of my led
04:09 - and the other end of the resistor to the
04:11 - negative
04:12 - of y
04:26 - same goes for my green and led i'm going
04:28 - to connect
04:29 - to the same hole that has the negative
04:32 - like and then
04:36 - i'm going to connect to any rail of the
04:40 - negative when you're building the
04:42 - circuit
04:43 - make sure that the shorter length of the
04:45 - led and one end
04:46 - of the resistor should be connected
04:49 - in the same column of the breadboard
04:56 - all right so once i have connected my
04:58 - leds
04:59 - next i'm going to connect the leds with
05:02 - the arduino board
05:04 - all right now i'm going to connect my
05:06 - red led to pin 10 in my arduino board
05:10 - so i'm going to connect the longer leg
05:12 - of the
05:13 - red led
05:18 - to pin 10 in my arduino board
05:25 - awesome so i'm going to repeat the same
05:28 - step for my real
05:29 - led and my green led
05:32 - i'm going to connect the longer leg of
05:35 - my yellow led
05:41 - to pin 9
05:44 - and the positive leg of the green led
05:49 - to pin 8.
06:02 - so once i have connected my leds with
06:05 - the resistors
06:06 - and the arduino pins next i need to
06:09 - complete my circuit
06:11 - so i'm going to connect the negative and
06:13 - the positive rails of the breadboard
06:16 - to the ground pin and the five volt pin
06:18 - respectively
06:19 - on the arduino owner
07:00 - arduino uno is a mini computer that is
07:02 - used to make
07:03 - simple robots and machines we can use an
07:07 - arduino uno to connect a hardware
07:09 - circuit
07:10 - with a software all right
07:13 - now once we have built our circuit let's
07:16 - look
07:17 - how we can program our traffic lights
07:22 - so how does a traffic light actually
07:24 - work
07:25 - first it will light up the red light
07:28 - that is followed by the yellow light
07:30 - and finally the green line
07:34 - so when we are coding the actual flow of
07:37 - the traffic light would be
07:39 - first we are going to on our red led
07:43 - next we are going to switch off the red
07:45 - led and
07:47 - then on the yellow led and the third
07:50 - step would be
07:52 - we are going to switch off the yellow
07:53 - led and then on
07:55 - the green led and finally the green
07:59 - led would light off and then it will
08:01 - switch on the
08:02 - red led to give the actual flow of
08:06 - traffic lights
08:19 - so let's go ahead and see how we can
08:22 - program this circuit
08:23 - on m block in order to connect my
08:26 - employee platform with my arduino uno
08:30 - i need to add my device into the
08:32 - platform
08:33 - so i'm going to click on the add device
08:38 - option
08:41 - next i'm going to find my arden uno
08:45 - and i'm going to click ok
08:50 - now once i have added my arduino owner
08:53 - component
08:54 - onto the m block platform i'm going to
08:56 - switch the mode
08:57 - to live
08:59 - [Music]
09:04 - next i'm going to the yellow color
09:05 - blocks that is called events
09:08 - and i'm going to drag the event block
09:11 - when the green flag is clear
09:14 - next in order to light up my leds
09:17 - repeatedly
09:18 - i'm going to drag a forever loop which
09:20 - you can find in the
09:22 - control blocks
09:30 - next i'm going to configure my arduino
09:34 - pins
09:36 - first i need to light up my red led
09:40 - so i'm going to bring the block set
09:41 - digital pin
09:44 - and i'm going to change the pin to be
09:51 - 10.
09:54 - next i'm going to give a weight block
09:56 - such that
09:57 - the red led lights up for 2 seconds
10:12 - next in my traffic light flow my yellow
10:15 - led should be light up
10:16 - while my red led should be sharp
10:20 - next i'm going to configure the pins for
10:22 - my red led
10:24 - to be low and for the yellow led it
10:27 - should be
10:28 - high so i'm going to drag and set
10:30 - digital pin block
10:33 - and i'm going to make it 10
10:37 - i'm going to set the output as low
10:42 - next i'm going to drag in the same block
10:44 - again
10:48 - and i'm going to change the pin to b9
10:53 - and i'm going to leave it as high
10:57 - next i'm going to bring a rate block
10:59 - again
11:00 - and i'm going to change it to be two
11:03 - seconds
11:06 - in my third step of the traffic light
11:08 - flow
11:09 - the green led should be light up while
11:11 - the yellow leds should be
11:13 - so sharp so i'm going to configure the
11:16 - pins of the green led and the yellow led
11:20 - so i'm going to switch on
11:27 - the yellow led wow
11:31 - i'm going to switch on my
11:35 - green led
11:40 - all right so in the last step the green
11:43 - leds should be switched off
11:46 - so i'm going to put another way block
11:51 - change it to be two seconds
11:59 - next i'm going to drag in the
12:03 - set digital pin block and i'm going to
12:05 - change it to begin a
12:08 - and i'm going to set it as lock to
12:11 - switch off my green lady
12:14 - all right now once we have finished our
12:17 - project
12:18 - let's go ahead and connect with our
12:20 - arduino uno
12:23 - so i'm going to click on connect this
12:26 - will show me the code where my arduino
12:28 - board is connected
12:31 - next i'm going to click on connect
12:35 - in order to make sure that your code is
12:37 - directly uploaded
12:39 - onto your arduino board i'm going to
12:42 - click on
12:42 - settings and i'm going to click on
12:45 - update
12:50 - firmware
13:02 - i'm going to go ahead and click on
13:03 - connect once again
13:08 - so in order to try out our circuit i'm
13:10 - going to click on
13:12 - green flag again
13:29 - you

bombs when electricity is powered and led have two legs one leg is longer than the other the longer leg is known as the anode which is also our positive leg the shorter leg is known as cathode which is the negative leg so i'm going to spread my legs a little bit further apart and i'm going to place my longer lid on my right hand side and the shorter leg on my left hand side so next i'm going to use my yellow led i'm going to spread them out like that and i'm going to place my shorter leg on my left hand side and the longer leg on my right hand side same goes for my green led so once i have set up my leds on my breadboard next i'm going to use resistors to control the amount of electricity that is passing along each route so i'm going to connect one end of the resistor to the negative

the led and one end of the resistor should be connected in the same column of the breadboard all right so once i have connected my leds next i'm going to connect the leds with the arduino board all right now i'm going to connect my red led to pin 10 in my arduino board so i'm going to connect the longer leg of the red led to pin 10 in my arduino board awesome so i'm going to repeat the same step for my real led and my green led i'm going to connect the longer leg of my yellow led to pin 9 and the positive leg of the green led to pin 8. so once i have connected my leds with the resistors and the arduino pins next i need to complete my circuit so i'm going to connect the negative and the positive rails of the breadboard to the ground pin and the five volt pin respectively on the arduino owner arduino uno is a mini computer that is used to make simple robots and machines we can use an arduino uno to connect a hardware circuit with a software all right now once we have built our

be we are going to switch off the yellow led and then on the green led and finally the green led would light off and then it will switch on the red led to give the actual flow of traffic lights so let's go ahead and see how we can program this circuit on m block in order to connect my employee platform with my arduino uno i need to add my device into the platform so i'm going to click on the add device option next i'm going to find my arden uno and i'm going to click ok now once i have added my arduino owner component onto the m block platform i'm going to switch the mode to live next i'm going to the yellow color blocks that is called events and i'm going to drag the event block when the green flag is clear next in order to light up my leds repeatedly i'm going to drag a forever loop

low next i'm going to drag in the same block again and i'm going to change the pin to b9 and i'm going to leave it as high next i'm going to bring a rate block again and i'm going to change it to be two seconds in my third step of the traffic light flow the green led should be light up while the yellow leds should be so sharp so i'm going to configure the pins of the green led and the yellow led so i'm going to switch on the yellow led wow i'm going to switch on my green led all right so in the last step the green leds should be switched off so i'm going to put another way block change it to be two seconds next i'm going to drag in the set digital pin block and i'm going to change it to begin a and i'm going to set it as lock to switch off my green lady all right now once we have finished our project let's go ahead and connect with our arduino uno so i'm going to click on connect this will show me the code where my arduino board is connected next i'm going to click on connect in order to make sure that your code is directly uploaded onto your arduino board i'm going to click on settings and i'm going to click on update firmware i'm going to go ahead and click on connect once again
