01:01 - i'll have to buy
01:04 - uh snacks
01:06 - for another ten dollars
01:10 - okay and you'll see here that uh the app
01:13 - gives us how much money how much budget
01:15 - we have left
01:17 - so this video is the first part of the
01:18 - project
01:19 - i'm in this video we're going to go over
01:21 - the designing part only
01:25 - okay we'll start by adding a new project
01:28 - in app inventor and we'll name our
01:30 - project
01:32 - my
01:33 - wallet
01:37 - all right and then click on
01:39 - my wallet the one that we just created
01:44 - okay so we're going to design the first
01:45 - screen so drag in two
01:48 - items from user interface
01:50 - drag in a label
01:52 - and
01:54 - drag in a button from the same section
01:59 - so a button and a label all right
02:01 - okay now we want to change the size the
02:04 - font size for both of
02:06 - them i'm going to put 30
02:09 - for
02:11 - and 20 for the other one
02:13 - okay
02:16 - this one and we are going to rename it
02:17 - so that
02:19 - to be the app the name of the app so
02:23 - my
02:24 - wallet
02:26 - okay
02:28 - and also change the width to
02:31 - fill parent
02:34 - okay and sex alignment
02:36 - we can also change the color by clicking
02:39 - on background color
02:41 - i want mine to be yellow
02:43 - and
02:44 - i want to change the text color too just
02:47 - here and then click on white
02:49 - wait that's not good
02:50 - okay orange instead okay this is much
02:52 - better and for the bottom one
02:56 - uh this button is going to
02:59 - allow us access to the wallet so
03:02 - for this button we'll change it to
03:06 - go
03:06 - to
03:07 - wallet
03:09 - and change the width to fill parent also
03:13 - okay
03:15 - and you can change the design as you
03:17 - want
03:18 - i'm going to make my font fold
03:21 - and i'm going to change the background
03:23 - color to
03:24 - be blue
03:25 - and change the text color i want it to
03:28 - be white
03:30 - so this is what it looks like
03:32 - okay next we're going to add in an
03:35 - option where user can add in their
03:37 - budget
03:38 - so go to layout
03:40 - and then find horizontal arrangement
03:42 - drag it
03:44 - and then we're going to change
03:46 - the width to be filled parent
03:49 - and the height let's make it 50 pixels
03:54 - okay
03:56 - uh now we want to go to
03:59 - user interface again and then drag in
04:03 - a label
04:06 - and
04:07 - drag in another
04:10 - text block a text box okay
04:14 - now for the label we wanted to say
04:19 - for the label we wanted to say add a
04:21 - budget
04:26 - and let's make it big so we can see it
04:29 - clearly
04:30 - 20
04:32 - this one also
04:35 - all right
04:36 - now let's make it
04:38 - center so go to horizontal arrangement
04:41 - and this one will
04:43 - change the components inside this
04:45 - horizontal arrangement to be the center
04:48 - so vertical and
04:51 - center like this
04:53 - okay
04:54 - now we want to change the name of the
04:56 - components in our screen
04:59 - so for this label one i'll just say
05:02 - label
05:07 - we have to change it so that when we
05:09 - code it's easy to know
05:13 - it's more organized
05:16 - and for the button button
05:18 - wallet
05:20 - for this label
05:22 - label
05:25 - budget
05:26 - and for this one i'm gonna name it
05:30 - textbox budget
05:34 - now we want to make our app more uh
05:37 - user friendly so we're going to add in a
05:39 - background
05:40 - but we want the background to just
05:42 - appear over
05:44 - in this space
05:46 - over here
05:48 - okay so we're going to do that by
05:52 - going to layout and dragging the
05:54 - horizontal arrangement block
05:56 - and then click on horizontal arrangement
05:59 - we're going to change the height and the
06:01 - width to fill parent

06:04 - so
06:06 - okay now go to user interface and then
06:09 - drag in an image component
06:11 - here
06:13 - and then we'll change it to as for the
06:15 - image we also want it to be in the
