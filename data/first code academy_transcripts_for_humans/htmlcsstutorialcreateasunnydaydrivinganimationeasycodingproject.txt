02:28 - alt and then i'm going to close the
02:32 - image tab
02:35 - next i'm going to close this section so
02:37 - i'm going to close with
02:38 - a closing test tag
02:42 - my next section would be my ground so
02:44 - i'm going to create
02:47 - tip id
02:56 - which i'm going to close
03:01 - awesome now we have done with our html
03:04 - section
03:05 - let's head on to the css all right so
03:07 - now we are going to use css to make our
03:10 - webpage
03:11 - more beautify and then give the
03:13 - animation methods
03:15 - so i'm going to create the skype
03:22 - i'm going to give a height of
03:26 - 200 pixels
03:30 - and i'm going to give color the
03:31 - background
03:36 - in cyan color
03:40 - next i'm going to give my position to be
03:44 - relative
03:48 - all right so next i'm going to give the
03:50 - appearance for my graph
03:51 - where my car drives along
03:58 - here i'm going to give the height for my
04:00 - brow
04:08 - and then i'm going to color the ground
04:10 - in green color
04:20 - all right so now once we have made the
04:21 - sky underground
04:23 - we are going to change the appearance of
04:25 - our sun and the cup
04:27 - first i'm going to change the appearance
04:29 - of the sun where i'm going to
04:31 - move the sun to the right corner of the
04:34 - web page
04:35 - and then i'm going to transform it to be
04:38 - a little bit smaller
04:43 - so i'm going to write sun
04:46 - and i'm going to give the position of
04:49 - it to be absolute
04:59 - next i'm going to change the position of
05:02 - it to
05:03 - be at the right side
05:10 - next i'm going to make the sun element
05:12 - to be 0.5 times the size it was before
05:16 - so i'm going to use transform
05:23 - and then scale
05:31 - same goes for the cup so i'm going to
05:34 - change the position of
05:35 - it to be absolute and then change
05:38 - size of it to be 0.7 times
05:41 - the size it was before and then i'm
05:44 - going to place my car at the very
05:47 - left corner of my webpage so i'm going
05:49 - to
05:50 - do a little modification to the car
05:52 - element
05:53 - i'm going to write the element
05:57 - i'm going to write positions which is
06:00 - going to be absolute
06:05 - so next i'm going to place it in between
06:07 - the sky
06:08 - and the crown right top
06:18 - pixels
06:27 - all right to create the moving effect of
06:29 - my car i'm going to add the animation
06:31 - property
06:32 - into my car element so i'm going to
06:35 - write
06:36 - animation name
06:44 - right next i'm going to give how long
06:48 - my animation should be running
06:54 - animation duration i'm going to make it
06:57 - five seconds next i'm going to give
07:01 - the loop count for my animation so
07:04 - animation
07:11 - so i'm going to make my card to drag
07:13 - towards the right hand side
07:15 - wherever while i'm seeing my webpage so
07:18 - i'm going to give the property value to
07:20 - be
07:20 - in finale
07:24 - to run my animation i'm going to use the
07:27 - act
07:28 - keypad rule
07:31 - so down below i'm going to write add
07:33 - keyframes
07:37 - next i'm going to call the name of my
07:39 - animation which is
07:42 - drive
07:45 - so next i'm going to state how my
07:47 - animation should be running
07:50 - that is by decline to and from
07:56 - i'm going to write from
08:00 - left
08:05 - close to
08:10 - right you should move 65
08:15 - so from
08:20 - zero pixels to
08:24 - the final frame so my final frame should
08:27 - be
08:27 - sixty-five percent from the current left
08:30 - position
08:32 - so last i'm gonna do at 65
08:39 - now we have completed the css code for
08:41 - our car element
08:43 - next we are going to see how we can
08:45 - expand our sun element
08:47 - whenever we move our mouse on top of it
08:49 - so we are going to add a server code
08:52 - selected to the sun element
08:54 - called hover which will trigger your
08:57 - element
08:57 - to be expanded whenever you move your
09:00 - mouse
09:01 - so i'm going to write sun element
09:05 - and i'm going to add the server code
09:08 - selected call
09:09 - hub next to expand your sun i'm going to
09:13 - use the property called
09:14 - transpo
09:20 - transform
09:22 - and scale
09:25 - one
09:28 - all right now we have completed the css
09:32 - code for the car element
09:34 - and the sun element
09:41 - now you can see that the car is moving
09:43 - towards the right side of the webpage
09:46 - and when we hover the sun with our
09:48 - cursor
09:49 - it would expand
09:52 - now it's a sunny day driving so that's
09:56 - all for today i hope you like this
