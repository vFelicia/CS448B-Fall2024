00:00 - everyone so today we're going to be
00:01 - making a red envelope in minecraft
00:04 - using learn to mod and we're going to be
00:06 - first making a texture pack
00:08 - and then we'll be making a mod which
00:10 - will be blocks of code
00:12 - which will be added into minecraft and
00:14 - then run to give
00:16 - us our red envelope so let's begin so
00:19 - once we had to
00:20 - learn to mod i'd like you to click on
00:22 - the green button here
00:24 - after you log in this will take you to
00:26 - your server
00:27 - once you land at this my server page
00:30 - make sure that you are the admin
00:33 - of your server over here and here you
00:36 - have the start server button so you can
00:37 - click on this
00:39 - and give it a few seconds and it starts
00:41 - loading your
00:42 - server and the reason we're doing this
00:45 - first is because this takes a few
00:46 - minutes after this is done
00:49 - we will then move on to designing our
00:51 - texture pack
00:52 - and creating our mod
00:56 - so while this loads what you can do you
00:58 - can open a new tab
00:59 - and head to learn to mod and then
01:02 - go here then you can click on the
01:06 - login option over here
01:09 - and then you can click at this play and
01:12 - then you can click
01:13 - on the texture packs so what i'm going
01:16 - to type in here is
01:17 - red underscore
01:20 - nv low and then underscore two
01:27 - once that's done you'll see that it's
01:29 - added over here in texture pack and you
01:31 - can click on see inside
01:34 - so once you're here you're created with
01:36 - this page
01:37 - and this block shows you what is needed
01:40 - when you want to call in your design
01:42 - so this we need to keep it handy for now
01:46 - and we're going to click on change here
01:48 - so
01:49 - when you click on change you're going to
01:50 - start adding your design
01:53 - here we have search so we would like to
01:56 - first
01:56 - find a diamond or click on this
02:00 - so what we'd like to do first is we'll
02:02 - click on this red color here
02:05 - click on that and then what you can do
02:07 - is just
02:08 - zoom in like this with your mouse and
02:11 - just
02:12 - color it inside here and then after
02:15 - you're done
02:16 - what you can do next is click on this
02:19 - commit change
02:20 - so it saves your mod so once your mod is
02:22 - saved
02:23 - what you can do next is you can close
02:25 - this here
02:28 - the next thing we'd like to do is we'd
02:30 - like to find paper
02:31 - so we search for paper
02:34 - and then we click on this so once you
02:37 - have this you can design this
02:39 - and i'm just going to color it red
02:43 - so once again i can zoom in here with my
02:46 - mouse
02:47 - like this just color it everywhere
02:55 - all right so once you're done coloring
02:57 - that you can add in more color
02:58 - so i'm just gonna click on this golden
03:01 - color
03:02 - and make a design here
03:05 - like this
03:12 - once that's done you can click on commit
03:14 - change once again
03:17 - and then it's saved so now that we have
03:20 - these two things
03:21 - over here what we'd like to do is we
03:24 - have to make sure we deploy
03:26 - our design so we click on deploy and we
03:29 - wait
03:29 - for it to be deployed so we give it a
03:31 - bit of time and then
03:33 - it will say deploying wait a moment
03:35 - please refresh the page
03:36 - so what you can do next is you can just
03:39 - refresh the page here
03:40 - reload
03:44 - then it says deployed so you can head
03:47 - back to play
03:48 - and then go back to our texture pack so
03:50 - we can look back inside here
03:52 - click on view as remember this part is
03:55 - important
03:56 - this is needed so
04:00 - our server is already running the next
04:02 - part we want to add
04:03 - is our mod so click on play
04:07 - and then click on mod
04:10 - so here what we're going to type in this
04:13 - is red
04:15 - underscore envelope underscore
04:19 - so we're going to click here
04:22 - on blockly multiplayer
04:26 - then once you click on that it will
04:27 - create this mod over here
04:30 - so let's keep this page for now i would
04:33 - like to open another tab
04:35 - and paste this address back
04:40 - as i'd like to check out my texture pack
04:43 - as this is something we'll be needing
04:46 - so that texture back is over here and as
04:49 - i mentioned earlier we'll need this
04:51 - as this will help us refer to our
04:53 - texture pack over here
04:56 - so once we go inside our mod
05:01 - we are created with this and then we can
05:03 - click on code
05:05 - so once we're landed on the red envelope
05:07 - page we're created with this
05:09 - yeah so what we're going to do first
05:12 - is we're going to click on functions and
05:14 - take out function do something
05:16 - i'm going to change this to me and the
05:19 - next thing
05:20 - inside is we're going to click on the
05:22 - layer block and here
05:25 - it says change texture pack for
05:28 - player now that player is us so
05:31 - how do we do that we click on player
05:33 - take out
05:34 - me now it asks us pac right the url
05:38 - so this url is placed here so we'll copy
05:42 - and then paste it in here
05:46 - next thing we'd like to do is we'd like
05:48 - to create a variable so a variable
05:50 - is a data type which stores an
05:52 - information
05:53 - and you can name it to anything you like
05:55 - so click on variables
05:57 - take out set item put that here click on
06:00 - item we rename this we're going to call
06:02 - this n
06:03 - v loop so envelope
06:07 - so we call this envelope next we want to
06:10 - add in a new item we want to add in the
06:13 - material that we have
06:14 - which is paper and to do that we click
06:17 - on the item block so over here you'll
06:21 - see
06:21 - new item material
06:25 - and then here and then there's a amount
06:28 - so
06:29 - what we're going to do first is click on
06:32 - the
06:33 - math block here and then drag this out
06:36 - put this over here
06:38 - and put in the number one and then
06:41 - for materials we will scroll down to p
06:44 - for paper and then the next thing we'd
06:49 - like to do
06:50 - is we now want to change the item
06:53 - and to do that we're again going to go
06:56 - back to
06:56 - the item block and then here we're going
06:59 - to take out
07:01 - change item here
07:04 - so in here we have this variable of
07:07 - envelope so we're going to click on
07:08 - variable
07:09 - take that out and put that here and
07:11 - we're going to change its name
07:13 - of this paper so here if you want to
07:16 - change the name we can click on text
07:18 - and then take this out drag this inside
07:20 - here
07:21 - and change this to nv
07:24 - loop next we want it to give us this
07:29 - item so we click on item
07:31 - and we take out give item to
07:34 - so the player it's going to give to is
07:37 - us
07:37 - so we're going to click on the player
07:40 - over here and take out me and we can
07:44 - just duplicate this
07:46 - and paste this here i'm going to give in
07:50 - the
07:51 - so the next thing we need to add is
07:54 - we want to also add in our diamond ore
07:57 - as when we break that block
07:58 - it will give us the envelope
08:02 - so you click on this copy paste and then
08:05 - you can bring this down
08:06 - here but we're gonna add in a new
08:09 - variable so we click on this and we
08:12 - click on new variable and type in block
08:16 - we can remove this paper as we won't be
08:18 - using it and then we can click on
08:20 - material d
08:22 - and as you scroll down you will see a
08:24 - diamond hole
08:25 - you can drag that and put that in here
08:29 - next once again we want to change the
08:31 - name so we're going to take this out
08:34 - and we're going to change this from the
08:37 - block and we want to give this a
08:39 - name here we're going to call this
08:41 - envelope
08:45 - and then the next thing we want to do we
08:47 - want to give this item
08:49 - to us so we won't be giving envelope and
08:52 - be giving the
08:54 - so what we've done here we've created a
08:56 - function
08:57 - and in this function we are changing the
08:59 - texture pack
09:00 - first by getting what we've made then
09:03 - we've created a variable called
09:05 - envelope and it's taking the item of
09:07 - paper and it's given us one
09:09 - and we've changed that from the paper to
09:12 - envelope as in the name and we want it
09:15 - to be given to us
09:17 - next we've created a variable called
09:18 - block and it's given us one diamond ore
09:22 - but through the texture pack let's
09:23 - change this to the diamond ore that we
09:25 - created
09:26 - with red color and then it has changed
09:29 - that name to
09:30 - envelope block and that also has been
09:32 - given to us
09:33 - so once we click mod what this does is
09:36 - it sends this
09:37 - to minecraft so it says here that it's
09:40 - going to be in our mod
09:43 - and here is our ip address so
09:47 - for this we need to actually use
09:49 - minecraft 1.9
09:50 - we won't be using the latest version so
09:54 - we can go ahead by copying and pasting
09:57 - this
09:58 - and then you can launch your minecraft
10:00 - over here
10:03 - so you can click on play
10:07 - click this make sure it's 1.9
10:11 - and then here you can click on
10:13 - multiplayer because we can click
10:15 - add server and then click here add in
10:18 - the ip address we have then double click
10:22 - this and then we'll join our server so
10:25 - once we're in our world
10:27 - we can click on number nine you can
10:30 - place this mod block here and then
10:31 - you'll see this
10:32 - mr sids red envelope too so that's the
10:35 - mod that we just made which has been
10:37 - pushed into minecraft
10:39 - put that here and then
10:42 - once we're done with this we can deploy
10:45 - it by pressing one
10:47 - then it will say it wants to connect to
10:49 - a custom resource pack would you like to
10:51 - download and install it you click yes
10:55 - so what it's doing it's downloading and
10:57 - installing our texture pack
10:59 - and then after that's done you'll notice
11:01 - that we got our red envelope
11:03 - and we got this envelope blocked
11:08 - so congrats you've made your mod you
11:10 - have a red envelope
11:12 - and you got your envelope so this is the
11:15 - end of the tutorial
