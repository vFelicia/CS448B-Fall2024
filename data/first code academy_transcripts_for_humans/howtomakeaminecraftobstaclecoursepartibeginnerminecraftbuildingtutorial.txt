00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - minecraft roblox web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we're going to create an obstacle
00:13 - course in minecraft
00:14 - using redstone
00:17 - this is a two-part video in this first
00:21 - part of the obstacle course
00:22 - we'll be looking at the unwelcoming wall
00:26 - and the wall running obstacles and in
00:28 - this process
00:29 - we'll learn how to do a redstone circuit
00:32 - so let's get started so we're going to
00:35 - start by creating a creative world
00:37 - in minecraft so to start with we click
00:40 - on single player
00:42 - and since i don't have a world created
00:44 - um he has
00:45 - told me to make a new world here i'm
00:48 - going to change the game mode
00:50 - into creative change of difficulty to
00:53 - peaceful
00:54 - so there's no mobs that can attack us
00:56 - and lastly i'm gonna go into more
00:58 - world options change the world type into
01:01 - super flat
01:03 - and then i'm gonna create my world
01:08 - and once the word has generated we can
01:10 - start doing
01:21 - so as you can see our world is just flat
01:23 - and we're also in creative world so if i
01:25 - press e or
01:26 - my inventory i have access to all blocks
01:28 - and i can also double click
01:30 - on spacebar to fly
01:34 - so for the first obstacle we want to
01:37 - build
01:37 - a red stone circuit in order to
01:41 - act as an internal clock that activates
01:43 - the pistons
01:45 - so i'm gonna pick up a block and uh
01:48 - it doesn't matter what block you pick so
01:50 - i'm just gonna pick stone
01:52 - and i'm gonna go to redstone we'll pick
01:55 - piston
01:57 - a redstone torch
02:01 - the redstone repeater redstone dust
02:07 - and i'm also going to grab the ladder
02:08 - while i'm here so ladder
02:11 - all right so for our obstacle
02:15 - we want to build it three blocks high so
02:17 - we're gonna have
02:19 - one two three and then
02:22 - build two more blocks above that like
02:24 - this and then i can remove the three
02:26 - blocks underneath like so
02:28 - so i have two blocks that are three
02:30 - blocks above and i'm gonna
02:32 - build two block across and one block
02:34 - down so you look like
02:36 - this and in the middle
02:39 - i'm gonna put a sticky piston or just a
02:42 - normal piston it's up to you
02:44 - right here and now for me
02:47 - after that i'm gonna build a platform uh
02:50 - beneath
02:51 - and behind the piston so i'm gonna build
02:54 - three blocks here
02:56 - platform like this and i'm gonna build a
02:57 - three by two
03:00 - platform like so
03:04 - and to do the red stone circuit um i'll
03:07 - just show it on the floor here and see
03:09 - how it works
03:11 - so we start by placing a block and the
03:15 - block is going to hold the rest on torch
03:17 - the redstone torch is going to supply
03:19 - power
03:20 - to whatever redstone tools is connected
03:23 - to it
03:24 - so the first thing we're connecting is a
03:26 - restroom repeater
03:28 - and as you can see is lit up that means
03:29 - it is powered by the restroom torch
03:32 - then i'm going to have redstone dust run
03:34 - across like this
03:36 - and i'm going to use another repeater
03:38 - and i'm going to aim it at the block
03:42 - so now you see we have an internal clock
03:43 - going and
03:46 - this is going to be what we build over
03:48 - here to make the piston
03:50 - extend itself periodically
03:53 - and pretty much how this works is that
03:55 - the wrestling torch is powering this
03:56 - repeater
03:57 - this repeater is powering this repeater
03:59 - which is powering on this block
04:01 - and whenever a block is powered it
04:03 - actually turns off
04:04 - the redstone torch so the restaurant
04:07 - torch turns off
04:08 - which turns off this repeater which
04:10 - turns off this repeater
04:11 - which turn off the power in this block
04:13 - turning this clock
04:14 - or turning this torch back on and i just
04:17 - keeps repeating
04:19 - so over here we'll fly over here
04:23 - and we're going to put the same thing as
04:24 - what we have over here so let's start
04:27 - at this platform at the very edge to the
04:29 - right i'm gonna put down a block
04:32 - then i'm gonna put a restaurant torch
04:35 - just like how we have it there
04:37 - a repeater going out
04:40 - restaurant dust going across and finally
04:44 - a repeater going back into the block
04:46 - so here we can see we have the redstone
04:48 - circuits going
04:50 - and the final step is to put a
04:52 - restaurant dust
04:54 - connecting it to the pistons so now you
04:56 - can see the power to the pistons on and
04:57 - off
04:59 - and on this side you can see the piston
05:00 - going on you know pushing it
05:03 - off and on extending itself periodically
05:08 - and the final step for our obstacle
05:10 - course is to build a platform
05:12 - that the user has to walk across so here
05:14 - i'm gonna build a platform
05:16 - and to get up to this platform i'm gonna
05:19 - build
05:20 - here a three block high
05:25 - ladder like so so we can go up
05:31 - and uh yep if you see that i wasn't
05:33 - careful and i was pushed off
05:35 - by the pistons
05:40 - if you have enjoyed this video be sure
05:42 - to subscribe to our channel
05:44 - and also like our video so far
05:48 - so moving on to the second uh
05:52 - second obstacle we can actually put it
05:54 - to the left of here
05:55 - as the second level kind of and what
05:58 - we're going to do
05:59 - is pick up the glass blocks and these
06:01 - will be
06:02 - placeholders for us and what i'm going
06:04 - to do
06:06 - is i'm going to build
06:10 - what i'm going to do is build the glass
06:12 - blocks um
06:14 - six blocks high so here we have one two
06:18 - three four five
06:19 - six and then here's gonna be my actual
06:22 - wall that i'm gonna have the user climb
06:25 - so here you can make any shape you want
06:27 - with the actual blocks
06:29 - and here i'm gonna make
06:36 - some kind of weird
06:39 - not even shape maybe like so
06:43 - and what we're going to do is put the
06:45 - ladders on the very bottom layer
06:49 - of each one so i'm going to go like this
06:53 - and you can also add a layer on this
06:55 - side like this
06:57 - and you can layer
07:01 - your ladders however way you want to
07:03 - make it easier or harder for the user to
07:05 - climb
07:07 - but um this will conclude our second
07:09 - obstacle
07:10 - and so we can just build a platform
07:13 - like maybe because we start over here we
07:16 - can build a platform like so
07:21 - so that the user can start from here and
07:24 - they have to make their way across
07:26 - and here i'm going to add a platform in
07:29 - which the user has successfully won the
07:31 - game
07:33 - so here i'm up there with the platform
07:35 - right
07:36 - next to the endpoints like this
07:44 - and yeah these are two obstacles for our
07:48 - first half of the video
07:50 - so that's all for today i hope you guys
07:52 - enjoyed don't forget to subscribe and
07:53 - like our videos
07:54 - also check out our other two videos
07:56 - while you're here
07:58 - thank you bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch minecraft roblox web programming and many more today we're going to create an obstacle course in minecraft using redstone this is a twopart video in this first part of the obstacle course we'll be looking at the unwelcoming wall and the wall running obstacles and in this process we'll learn how to do a redstone circuit so let's get started so we're going to start by creating a creative world in minecraft so to start with we click on single player and since i don't have a world created um he has told me to make a new world here i'm going to change the game mode into creative change of difficulty to peaceful so there's no mobs that can attack us and lastly i'm gonna go into more world options change the world type into super flat and then i'm gonna create my world and once the word has generated we can start doing so as you can see our world is just flat and we're also in creative world so if i press e or my inventory i have access to all blocks and i can also double click on spacebar to fly so for the first obstacle we want to build a red stone circuit in order to act as an internal clock that activates the pistons so i'm gonna pick up a block and uh it doesn't matter what block you pick so i'm just gonna pick stone and i'm gonna go to redstone we'll pick piston a redstone torch the redstone repeater redstone dust and i'm also going to grab the ladder while i'm here so ladder all right so for our obstacle we want to build it three blocks high so we're gonna have one two three and then build two more blocks above that like this and then i can remove the three blocks underneath like so so i have two blocks that are three blocks above and i'm gonna build two block across and one block down so you look like this and in the middle i'm gonna put a sticky piston or just a normal piston it's up to you right here and now for me after that i'm gonna build a platform uh beneath and behind the piston so i'm gonna build three blocks here platform like this and i'm gonna build a three by two platform like so and to do the red stone circuit um i'll just show it on the floor here and see how it works so we start by placing a block and the block is going to hold the rest on torch the redstone torch is going to supply power to whatever redstone

this platform at the very edge to the right i'm gonna put down a block then i'm gonna put a restaurant torch just like how we have it there a repeater going out restaurant dust going across and

platform that the user has to walk across so here i'm gonna build a platform and to get up to this platform i'm gonna build here a three block high ladder like so so we can go up and uh yep if you see that i wasn't careful and i was pushed off by the pistons if you have enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe to our channel and also like our video so far so moving on to the second uh second obstacle we can actually put it to the left of here as the second level kind of and what we're going to do is pick up the glass blocks and these will be placeholders for us and what i'm going to do is i'm going to build what i'm going to do is build the glass blocks um six blocks high so here we have one two three four five six and then here's gonna be my actual wall that i'm gonna have the user
