00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - youtube channel
00:03 - here we should begin friendly coding
00:04 - tutorials in scratch roblox minecraft
00:07 - web programming and many more
00:09 - in today's scenario we will learn how to
00:11 - create our own music player using python
00:15 - in this project i will teach you how to
00:17 - use thinker and other library to make a
00:20 - music player so you can have your
00:22 - personalized design
00:24 - to play your
00:25 - favorite music so when i click
00:27 - on in this file i have this
00:30 - play when i click the play button
00:34 - it will just go into playroom so you
00:36 - know when i stopped it i'm just going to
00:38 - stop when i click play again click and
00:40 - then pause and then
00:43 - so pause
00:43 - hope you're interested so let's get
00:45 - started
00:47 - we are going to start
00:49 - by opening our terminal first
00:52 - uh
00:53 - well if it's like windows uh you can
00:55 - open prompt but um it's macbook pro for
00:59 - me so i'm going to use terminal so
01:01 - inside the terminal there's only one
01:03 - commander you have to type which is like
01:06 - installing this like
01:08 - python game library into our system so
01:12 - what i'm going to type is pip
01:15 - install
01:17 - py
01:18 - game and basically that's it
01:21 - so since i've already previously
01:23 - installed this
01:25 - into my library so that's why i don't
01:27 - have to like uh wait for it so
01:30 - yeah afterwards we can start moving on
01:33 - to our python idol
01:36 - so we're going to use the following
01:38 - libraries to work with our project
01:41 - so
01:42 - your
01:43 - import python game
01:45 - this one is for media
01:47 - is to create video games
01:49 - and the next one the tinker stkr
01:53 - this is for developing the
01:56 - gui which is the user interface
01:59 - and then the third one
02:01 - tinker
02:03 - dot file dialog
02:05 - ask
02:05 - directory
02:07 - this is to permit to select our
02:09 - different directory
02:11 - and then the next one is input os
02:14 - it permits us to interact with the
02:16 - operating system so basically that's it
02:19 - okay
02:20 - well again if you like this video so far
02:23 - don't forget to subscribe and like our
02:25 - videos
02:26 - so next we're going to close the windows
02:29 - uh of our program uh we're going to add
02:32 - any title
02:34 - that we want and we're going to set up
02:36 - the size of the window as well
02:37 - so in this case um we'll say
02:41 - player
02:44 - tkr
02:47 - tk
02:49 - and then
02:52 - player
02:56 - oh
02:58 - sorry
03:00 - title
03:01 - to music
03:03 - player
03:05 - using
03:07 - player
03:09 - geometry
03:13 - close to 500
03:16 - 500
03:18 - okay
03:20 - perfect
03:21 - so we're going to set up music file
03:23 - i will start by using asking like the
03:26 - ask directory function
03:28 - so
03:36 - this function
03:38 - well after this inserting this directory
03:40 - we can actually use the
03:43 - uh chdir
03:45 - which is just child directory directory
03:47 - to allow your os to switch
03:50 - directory to the one where the music
03:52 - file is
03:54 - so
04:01 - nope
04:04 - like that
04:06 - so
04:07 - now we're going to create a variable
04:09 - sound list soundlist is a variable which
04:11 - will store all of our files inside the
04:14 - news directory we are in
04:15 - so make sure you put all your favorite
04:17 - songs in the same directory
04:19 - so some
04:20 - less
04:23 - os
04:28 - okay
04:29 - now we're going to display all the
04:30 - tracks in the photo by using before
04:32 - after creating a list box
04:34 - select any setting you want for the list
04:37 - box and then use the form glue to insert
04:39 - all of these elements into playlist
04:41 - so play
04:43 - this
04:45 - equals to tkl
04:48 - list box
04:50 - so music
04:54 - player
04:57 - font
04:59 - i'm going to set my phone to
05:02 - for dana
05:08 - 12.
05:11 - and then
05:13 - f g
05:15 - fold
05:17 - navy
05:20 - and background
05:36 - done okay
05:38 - and then for the for loop
05:41 - we're going to create a new variable
05:42 - called x equals 0 x equals x equals 0
05:47 - and then 4 i in
05:49 - so
05:51 - let's
05:53 - we're going to
05:54 - playlist
05:57 - insert
05:59 - x and then i
06:03 - and then x
06:06 - one
06:08 - so like that
06:10 - perfect okay now we can write these two
06:12 - instructions to allow the python game to
06:15 - play some music
06:16 - so
06:20 - neat
06:21 - and then py game
06:24 - mixer
06:26 - dot
06:28 - like that these two
06:32 - okay
06:33 - well afterwards we're going to set up
06:35 - some functions so that we can use the
06:37 - buttons to play
06:39 - so there's like four buttons play stop
06:42 - pause and pause
06:43 - so
06:44 - i'm going to create all these rows deaf
06:48 - play
06:50 - and then
06:52 - inside the play button well obviously
06:54 - we're just going to play the selected uh
06:57 - music uh inside our file so that's why
07:00 - py pyking
07:02 - mixer music
07:06 - load
07:09 - get
07:11 - reactive
07:14 - like that and then
07:16 - far
07:17 - set
07:19 - play this
07:22 - get
07:23 - to hero active
07:27 - and then py key
07:28 - mix mixer
07:31 - music
07:32 - play
07:35 - okay finish up
07:36 - play button
07:38 - now for the
07:39 - wow it's really very easy for you to
07:42 - stop and then pause so we just like stop
07:45 - pausing plus functions like that
07:49 - stop
07:52 - like
07:53 - mixer
07:56 - see
08:08 - mixer
08:12 - music oops
08:14 - music
08:16 - pause
08:21 - yeah
08:23 - and pause
08:28 - so then pause
08:42 - that so we finish
08:45 - all the buttons we're going to define
08:47 - the buttons our own preferred
08:49 - settings make sure to add the text to
08:51 - what the user know what the button is
08:53 - supposed to do
08:54 - and use the command to link the buttons
08:56 - to the desired actions
08:59 - so
09:00 - in this case
09:03 - one
09:08 - that's it
09:10 - music
09:12 - player
09:18 - equals five
10:08 - okay
10:09 - i'm going to change
10:11 - copy and paste this three more times
10:13 - since we have four buttons
10:16 - so and then change this to two
10:21 - with height
10:22 - stop
10:28 - three
10:31 - [Music]
10:38 - [Music]
10:43 - now we're going to use a variable to
10:45 - display the title of the song i usually
10:48 - think like so far again
10:54 - bar
10:58 - and then
10:59 - title
11:02 - tkr
11:05 - label
11:08 - music
11:27 - we are
11:29 - okay
11:31 - finally we are going to display the
11:33 - buttons we need to pack the instructions
11:35 - for the buttons
11:37 - so song
11:40 - title
11:42 - pack
11:46 - and then
11:55 - then same for the other buttons
12:02 - okay so here
12:05 - after we created all these buttons
12:07 - fill this we're just going to pack our
12:09 - fingers as well
12:23 - so
12:25 - and that means like player loop
12:34 - okay
12:35 - now we are actually done we can do this
12:39 - um well this is just a template you can
12:43 - change the size and then you can change
12:45 - the buttons or design whatever you like
12:49 - uh in your own style
12:51 - um so let's try it out right now
12:54 - so
12:56 - i'm going to
12:58 - share another screen
13:01 - so when i click f5
13:03 - let's see what's happening
13:06 - so you can see that it just pops up this
13:08 - directory so when i click desktop music
13:11 - choose
13:12 - then when i click one of them
13:16 - and then stop
13:18 - and then when i play again
13:21 - and pause
13:22 - and pause pause and pause

close the windows uh of our program uh we're going to add any title that we want and we're going to set up the size of the window as well so in this case um we'll say player tkr tk and then player oh sorry title to music player using player geometry close to 500 500 okay perfect so we're going to set up music file i will start by using asking like the ask directory function so this function well

glue to insert all of these elements into playlist so play this equals to tkl list box so music player font i'm going to set my phone to for dana 12. and then f g fold navy and background done okay and then for the for loop we're going to create a new variable called x equals 0 x equals x equals 0 and then 4 i in so let's we're going to playlist insert x and then i and then x one so like that perfect okay now we can write these two instructions to allow the python game to play some music so neat and then py game mixer dot like that these two okay well afterwards we're going to set up some functions so that we can use the buttons to play so there's like four buttons play stop pause and pause so i'm going to create all these rows deaf play and then inside the play button well obviously
