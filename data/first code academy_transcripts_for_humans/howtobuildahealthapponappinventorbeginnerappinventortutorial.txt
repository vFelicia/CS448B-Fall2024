00:02 - so yeah for today what I thought would
00:06 - be cool to do is to because of the past
00:09 - couple of weeks of the virus and we are
00:13 - you know we're stuck at home and a lot
00:16 - of times we you know I spend a lot of
00:19 - time playing video games or watching TV
00:21 - and I thought maybe we were just you
00:24 - know spend some time to create an app
00:26 - together and so while we're waiting for
00:29 - more people to join go ahead and if you
00:35 - want to follow along with this studio
00:38 - this tutorial if you want to join a long
00:44 - code along with me
00:45 - go ahead to this link here App Inventor
00:48 - where you need your laptop to access and
00:53 - I will be guiding you all to create an
00:56 - app together and it will be a short app
01:00 - that I designed for specifically for
01:05 - this stressful time for everyone and let
01:08 - me show you guys how it looks okay so
01:23 - here is how the app look and I designed
01:27 - this app because I thought that it would
01:29 - it might be nice to have an app on our
01:32 - phone that we could open up and remind
01:37 - us to take a deep breath and sometimes
01:41 - we might be very anxious in looking at
01:46 - the screen and looking at all the news
01:48 - that is happening and so how it works is
01:51 - that there is a button at the bottom
01:53 - which is hidden here but whenever you
01:56 - click on them give me a tip you actually
02:01 - are able to show it again the app would
02:07 - show you different tips to to take a
02:12 - deep breath and real
02:14 - so with that I am going to start with
02:23 - our project so yep so let's go ahead and
02:29 - start a new project and let's call it a
02:34 - brief app okay so I'm on the MIT App
02:40 - Inventor web interface and the link is
02:44 - commented down below and if you want to
02:47 - follow along definitely welcome to do
02:49 - that and how it works is that we will be
02:52 - using this app designer to create the
02:57 - interface the design of our app and then
03:00 - we will go inside to our blocks to
03:04 - create our logic and our code so yeah
03:13 - the next thing that we're gonna do is to
03:15 - remember our app we have our title first
03:19 - so we can call it take and remember so
03:32 - you can actually change this text to any
03:35 - colors and I'll change that to yellow
03:38 - because we'll have a background later on
03:41 - I will also change it to the width as
03:46 - wide as the screen and also put the text
03:54 - in the center so I know that this is a
03:57 - little bit difficult to read right now
04:00 - so what I'll do now is to upload a
04:03 - background image that I found just now
04:18 - so it'll just take a minute to upload it
04:21 - on the on a pin sensor there you go so
04:27 - we actually have our background image
04:29 - nicely put in the middle in the screen
04:32 - and what we need to do next is to add a
04:36 - an image so we're at an image here and
04:45 - we will also add a text which is if you
04:50 - remember earlier there's a quote that we
04:54 - show to our users that hey you know look
04:57 - no matter how like this is a quote that
05:00 - you can read and it will come will give
05:04 - us some give us some inspiration and
05:08 - lastly is a button for us to choose you
05:13 - know to ask the the app to prompt us
05:16 - another nice relaxation so I will write
05:29 - down here give me a relaxing tip and
05:34 - really we can use whatever we want to
05:38 - like to just prompt the user to click on
05:41 - the the app and what we will do is to go
05:50 - ahead and put in so I'll make it as wide
05:53 - as the screen and so here the width as
05:56 - fill parents I will also make our font
06:05 - size bigger just to make it easier to
06:09 - see so what I want to do is that when
06:14 - when the user open up the app I actually
06:17 - don't want these two image and the text
06:20 - to show up yet so what I'll do is to
06:24 - choose to select the image here and
06:27 - click physical like uncheck the visible
06:38 - next we will do the same for label 2
06:42 - which is the cult label for us and what
06:45 - I'll do here as well is actually to
06:47 - change it to the quote label clicking
06:51 - rename here so this will help us
06:54 - remember what these quotes what the
06:57 - label is for because we have two labels
07:00 - on our screen and then afterwards we
07:05 - will change it to we will actually
07:09 - change the fonts as well to yellow and
07:13 - change it to invisible for now so
07:18 - comment down below if you oh the screen
07:21 - is not showing the coding interesting oh
07:23 - yeah that's right okay so thanks for
07:26 - pointing it out so I forgot to a Switzer
07:29 - screen here so can you guys see it now
07:37 - okay thanks Winnie okay
07:49 - all right um I think I'll move my face
07:55 - down a little okay thank you so much for
08:00 - your patience everyone I am still
08:02 - learning how to do that this is very fun
08:05 - and okay I will change where my screen
08:08 - is and so okay let me start from the
08:11 - beginning yeah
08:13 - so I'll start from the beginning what I
08:17 - did here is yeah
08:24 - what I did here in the beginning is to
08:26 - drag a label so here is the App Inventor
08:31 - here is the App Inventor interface if
08:35 - you guys want to log in together and
08:37 - follow together the first step that we
08:40 - need to do is to drag a label onto the
08:44 - screen so this is the label and okay and
08:59 - then I have changed the text to take a
09:03 - deep breath and what I did here is also
09:08 - to change the text color to yellow and
09:13 - the font size of 30 and mix I want to
09:23 - change the background and so for the
09:28 - background image what I did is to choose
09:30 - the screen and change the background and
09:34 - by uploading a file it could be anything
09:37 - it could be a cat or a dog that you like
09:39 - for me I change it to a nice peaceful
09:43 - screen of clouds and ocean and next now
09:50 - we can see the nice background with the
09:53 - text and next we have also included an
09:59 - image here so the image is
10:02 - in turn is under the user interface and
10:05 - we can actually drag the image onto the
10:09 - screen and click physical as uncheck the
10:18 - visible the same thing we want to do for
10:24 - Holt label changing a text to yellow up
10:29 - first and then uncheck the visible
10:33 - function as well now with the last bit
10:41 - is the button 1 so button 1 is the first
10:46 - item on the interface and what I did
10:49 - just now is to change the text to give
10:52 - me a relaxing tip and thanks we have our
10:57 - background color I change it to blue
10:59 - because it matches with the ocean and
11:02 - [Music]
11:04 - also I created I made the font size
11:08 - bigger and so that is easier for
11:11 - everyone to read awesome so well after
11:20 - that we have all the components as
11:23 - needed on our screen so what we need to
11:26 - do next is to actually upload a file
11:29 - upload a couple of files so I would
11:32 - about the yoga file that I downloaded
11:37 - earlier I would upload the bathtub file
11:43 - and then I will also upload a meditate
11:52 - photo so here is where you upload the
11:58 - files such that you can use it in the
12:01 - code area so after you've uploaded three
12:05 - different images it could be other
12:07 - things than these three ones as well it
12:10 - doesn't have to be the same as mine and
12:12 - we will go ahead and switch into our
12:16 - blocks and then we are going to also
12:21 - make the quotes visible as well because
12:24 - when we first start the app we had made
12:26 - the main code the two components
12:31 - invisible all right so there we go we
12:37 - have finished our app tutorial here and
12:40 - this is a quick app that we can do for
12:44 - this time of coronavirus and we're
12:47 - constantly tens and basically feel like
12:52 - there's a lot happening and I would
12:54 - really highly encourage us to try making
12:57 - this app and what you can do to test
13:00 - this app out is to click the build
13:03 - function and choose if you have an
13:07 - Android device you can use the QR code
13:10 - to scan it and test it on your phone if
13:14 - you don't no worries you can also save
13:17 - it on your computer and there are
13:19 - android simulators that are you can test
13:22 - out on your computer test your app out
13:25 - on your computer right away so I use
13:28 - BlueStacks and right now I cannot I
13:33 - cannot seem to to show this on the
13:36 - screen but basically how it works is
13:39 - that you can download BlueStacks and you
13:43 - can then use it to test out your apps
13:46 - right on your computer and so all you
13:48 - need to do is to save apk file to your
13:52 - computer and you will be able to play
13:55 - around with your app so yeah that's it
14:02 - from me and I want to cost here a little
14:05 - bit I
14:06 - thank you so much for joining everyone
14:08 - so you guys have any mark Marvin thanks
14:11 - for joining thanks for joining
14:13 - also Donna as well so do you guys have
14:17 - any questions or anything or or any
14:19 - ideas of apps you would want to see
14:22 - tutorials or I plan to do the Facebook
14:26 - live once a week at least and yeah
14:29 - comment down below if you have any ideas
14:32 - of apps or games that you think that
14:35 - might be fun to do together and I love
14:39 - to hear from you guys thank you I'll see
14:43 - you in the next life
14:45 - [Music]
