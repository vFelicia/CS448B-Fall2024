00:00 - everyone so welcome to this tutorial in
00:02 - this tutorial we're going to be making a
00:04 - lightning arrow
00:05 - in minecraft with the use of javascript
00:08 - so i'm going to show you what this
00:09 - project looks like
00:11 - let's begin so right over here
00:14 - i am in my minecraft world and i have
00:17 - a bunch of arrows i have 64 arrows and i
00:20 - have a bow
00:21 - so this is in creative mode
00:24 - so once i loaded the mod i can just
00:28 - point the arrow
00:31 - lightning has been fired
00:34 - so this is what the mod is going to look
00:36 - like let's start by coding this mode
00:38 - first we open sublime text next we'd
00:40 - like to click on file
00:42 - and save as and then remember we're
00:45 - going to put this
00:46 - in our speak.mc folder so you can click
00:48 - on speak.mc
00:50 - as you scroll down you'll see
00:51 - scriptcraft as you scroll into
00:54 - scriptcraft you'll see plugins
00:56 - so we are going to save our file over
00:58 - here
00:59 - call i'm going to call this lightning
01:01 - arrow so l-i-g-h-t
01:04 - n-i-n-g and then capital a
01:07 - r-r-o-w dot js
01:10 - and then click on save so this is now
01:13 - saved as
01:14 - a javascript file and to see that
01:17 - we can just head over here
01:20 - to our speaker mc folder and then you
01:24 - can
01:25 - head on to our scriptcraft folder
01:28 - plugins and then you'll see it right
01:31 - over here
01:32 - lightning arrow
01:39 - so now let's begin coding first we'll
01:41 - start by writing exports
01:43 - e x p o r t s dot
01:46 - light ning
01:53 - and then we'll put equal and then a
01:55 - function
01:58 - so there we've created a function and
02:01 - we've written
02:02 - lightning arrow next we want to create a
02:05 - function called
02:06 - strike so we'll write function
02:10 - strike and here we're going to add like
02:12 - a parameter called event
02:14 - as something's going to happen so we put
02:17 - event and then we add in our curly
02:19 - brackets
02:20 - here okay
02:23 - hit enter to make a space the next thing
02:27 - we'd like to do is we want to make a
02:28 - variable called projectile
02:30 - and what this is used for is going to
02:33 - get the
02:34 - item that we're going to use to shoot as
02:37 - a projectile
02:38 - so we're going to type in var to declare
02:41 - a variable
02:42 - and type in project tile
02:45 - so we have this here projectile and then
02:48 - we'll
02:48 - give it a value put event dot
02:52 - get ntt and then
02:55 - this and a semicolon so make sure you
02:59 - periodically save your work
03:01 - if you're on windows you can press ctrl
03:03 - s if you're on mac you can press command
03:05 - s next we'd like to create another
03:07 - variable
03:09 - so this is called shooter
03:12 - and this is referring to us so we're
03:15 - going to type in projectile
03:18 - dot get shooter
03:24 - the next part we'd like to do is we want
03:27 - to make a variable for our world
03:29 - basically the environment around us so
03:31 - we're going to call this var
03:33 - world equals projectile
03:37 - dot get world
03:41 - let me say this so what we've done so
03:44 - far we've
03:45 - created three variables one is
03:47 - projectile one is for the shooter and
03:48 - one is for the world
03:50 - projectile is what we're gonna use to
03:52 - shoot shooter
03:54 - is referring to us the player and then
03:56 - world is
03:57 - sort of referring to that environment
04:01 - next we're going to add in a conditional
04:04 - so you can make a space and put in a if
04:08 - as a if statement so we're now going to
04:13 - give these
04:15 - values to so we'll type in projectile
04:18 - here and then we'll use equal equal
04:21 - and now we want to specify what is the
04:23 - projectile that projectile that we're
04:25 - going to use
04:26 - is a craft arrow so we type in
04:29 - craft arrow
04:33 - and then we'll put a and and
04:36 - so here we want to give the shooter
04:40 - a name right we wanted to know who
04:43 - is the person shooting this bow and uh
04:46 - arrow
04:47 - so what we're doing now is we're going
04:48 - to give the shooter a name
04:51 - and we're going to give this shooter a
04:53 - name which is our minecraft name
04:55 - so we'll type in shooter dot name
04:58 - and then equal equal self dot name
05:03 - so sub dot name is referring to our
05:05 - minecraft name
05:07 - then we can put in this bracket and then
05:10 - make sure we have
05:11 - this here then
05:14 - under this we're gonna write in
05:16 - projectile
05:21 - the reason we're writing this is after
05:23 - we have shot it we want this ad to
05:25 - disappear
05:26 - after it's hit a target and then under
05:29 - this
05:30 - we want to say that we want a lightning
05:32 - to be striked
05:33 - so to add that we put in world dot
05:36 - strike
05:38 - ning and then put a bracket here
05:42 - so in here what we're going to add is
05:46 - projectile.location and that is where
05:48 - the arrow lands
05:49 - so we'll type in projectile dot
05:53 - location then we'll add it with this
05:56 - semicolon so so far we have added these
06:00 - parts
06:01 - so the last remaining part that we have
06:03 - to add is
06:05 - over here so here the next thing we're
06:07 - going to write is
06:08 - events dot projectile
06:13 - hit bracket strike
06:17 - let's just save it so so far this is our
06:21 - code
06:22 - and we've completed it so
06:24 - congratulations you have made your
06:26 - strike lightning mod with javascript
06:31 - so what we have done here we've said
06:33 - that if the
06:34 - craft arrow is being used as a
06:36 - projectile
06:37 - and the shooter is us when it lands
06:40 - on a specific area where we shoot it we
06:43 - want this air to be removed and then
06:45 - cause
06:45 - lightning and then when it's hit
06:49 - we want it to run a strike parameter
06:51 - which is this lightning
06:53 - over here and this function
06:57 - is referring to this so that's our mod
07:00 - so now we're going to test it out the
07:02 - first thing we need to do is we need to
07:04 - launch our minecraft and head into
07:06 - the server so first we type in cd
07:09 - desktop slash speak.mc
07:14 - so this in the terminal allows us to
07:16 - head into the spigot mc folder
07:19 - and to access the terminal you can just
07:22 - press command space and type in the
07:23 - terminal
07:25 - and then you can access this
07:29 - so now we're going to look at how we can
07:31 - open our mod
07:32 - and test it out in minecraft using the
07:35 - custom server that we have
07:36 - so first we're going to head to the
07:38 - terminal command space on your computer
07:40 - you type in terminal and you press enter
07:44 - next when this window opens we can type
07:46 - in cd
07:48 - and then desktop so cd is the short form
07:52 - of change directory we'd like to go
07:54 - inside the desktop and you could put a
07:55 - slash
07:56 - and type in spot mc
07:59 - so once you're there it says here
08:01 - speak.mc and then your username
08:04 - so the next part is we now want to run
08:06 - our server
08:08 - so we put in this command java space
08:11 - jar space spigot dash 1.10.2.jar
08:17 - this will help us start our server so
08:19 - you can press enter
08:20 - and it will start loading the libraries
08:22 - and the rest of the items
08:25 - as it runs so you have to give it a bit
08:27 - of time
08:29 - and once it starts loading you can test
08:31 - it out after it's done
08:34 - as it's done loading we now can open our
08:37 - minecraft
08:38 - over here
08:42 - so when you open minecraft
08:46 - please do remember that we'll be using
08:48 - the version
08:50 - 1.10.2 if you want to change your
08:52 - version you can click on installations
08:54 - here
08:55 - click on new give it any name you like
08:57 - and then just change the version from
08:59 - here
09:00 - and then click on create and that's how
09:02 - you can get to the older version
09:05 - if you have everything set up you can
09:07 - click on play
09:09 - and then click on play once again and
09:11 - minecraft should boot up
09:14 - so as the server is open what we need to
09:17 - do next
09:17 - is add in our ip address
09:21 - so once this opens up you can click on
09:23 - multiplayer
09:24 - and i'll remove this and i'll show you
09:26 - how to add in your own server so
09:28 - once you're here you click on add server
09:31 - you can give this a name
09:33 - mc3 server and then here
09:36 - for server address generally we'd
09:39 - recommend you to put in your ip address
09:41 - but
09:41 - here you can just type in localhost
09:45 - press done and then double click this
09:50 - so now we're going into our server and
09:52 - then you can see this
09:54 - over here it's loading
09:58 - once you're here you'll see that
10:02 - your world is loaded and for example if
10:06 - you don't have any items
10:07 - so i'll show you if it's blank you can
10:10 - actually give yourself items so first
10:13 - i would suggest slash game mode
10:16 - c to be in creative then once again you
10:19 - press
10:20 - slash you can use give at p
10:23 - p is referring to you as a player then
10:26 - you can press tab and it shows minecraft
10:28 - then you
10:28 - want arrows you type a r then it will
10:31 - show
10:32 - press tab again it'll complete the
10:34 - wording
10:35 - press space and you put in a number so
10:37 - you can put 64.
10:39 - it gives us 64 hours next
10:42 - we can put slash give at p
10:57 - so now that this is there we want to run
11:00 - so first we want to refresh the server
11:03 - slash js refresh
11:08 - slash js light
11:11 - new arrow
11:18 - [Music]
11:26 - this
11:29 - [Music]
11:35 - so i hope you guys had fun making that

Cleaned transcript:

everyone so welcome to this tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be making a lightning arrow in minecraft with the use of javascript so i'm going to show you what this project looks like let's begin so right over here i am in my minecraft world and i have a bunch of arrows i have 64 arrows and i have a bow so this is in creative mode so once i loaded the mod i can just point the arrow lightning has been fired so this is what the mod is going to look like let's start by coding this mode first we open sublime text next we'd like to click on file and save as and then remember we're going to put this in our speak.mc folder so you can click on speak.mc as you scroll down you'll see scriptcraft as you scroll into scriptcraft you'll see plugins so we are going to save our file over here call i'm going to call this lightning arrow so light ning and then capital a rrow dot js and then click on save so this is now saved as a javascript file and to see that we can just head over here to our speaker mc folder and then you can head on to our scriptcraft folder plugins and then you'll see it right over here lightning arrow so now let's begin coding first we'll start by writing exports e x p o r t s dot light ning and then we'll put equal and then a function so there we've created a function and we've written lightning arrow next we want to create a function called strike so we'll write function strike and here we're going to add like a parameter called event as something's going to happen so we put event and then we add in our curly brackets here okay hit enter to make a space the next thing we'd like to do is we want to make a variable called projectile and what this is used for is going to get the item that we're going to use to shoot as a projectile so we're going to type in var to declare a variable and type in project tile so we have this here projectile and then we'll give it a value put event dot get ntt and then this and a semicolon so make sure you periodically save your work if you're on windows you can press ctrl s if you're on mac you can press command s next we'd like to create another variable so this is called shooter and this is referring

you can use give at p p is referring to you as a player then you can press tab and it shows minecraft then you want arrows you type a r then it will show press tab again it'll complete the wording press space and you put in a number so you can put 64. it gives us 64 hours next we can put slash give at p so now that this is there we want to run so first we want to refresh the server slash js refresh slash js light new arrow this so i hope you guys had fun making that lightning arrow mod with javascript and testing it out in minecraft for more fun tutorials like this please make sure to
