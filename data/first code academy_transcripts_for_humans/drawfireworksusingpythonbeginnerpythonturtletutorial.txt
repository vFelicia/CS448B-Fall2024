00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share between the friendly
00:04 - coding tutorials on scratch roblox
00:07 - minecraft
00:07 - web programming and many more today we
00:10 - are going to make a fireworks animation
00:12 - using python turtle
00:15 - so in this project we will use
00:17 - randomness and drawing patterns
00:18 - to do some of how works and a message
00:21 - for the fourth of july
00:23 - so it just going to pops up some of the
00:26 - fireworks
00:27 - from random places and then after
00:30 - generating a certain fireworks out it
00:33 - would
00:34 - perform it would like shows up happy 4th
00:37 - of july
00:39 - so yeah just like that so let's get
00:42 - started
00:44 - so first of all we will start by
00:46 - creating a new project
00:47 - and importing the turtle and random
00:49 - libraries
00:50 - okay so we will use these two libraries
00:52 - for drawing and putting the fireworks in
00:54 - the random position
00:56 - so first of all we can do import
01:00 - turntable and import
01:04 - random okay after writing these two
01:07 - codes
01:08 - uh we can begin with the general setup
01:10 - of our program in this case
01:12 - we'll set up our screen to any size that
01:14 - we prefer
01:15 - and we'll make one turtle called my
01:17 - turtle head and then with speed zero
01:19 - so uh it's actually up to you with the
01:22 - setup of the size and
01:23 - the width of nsis in this case we're
01:26 - just going to use
01:27 - wn as a variable equals to turtle
01:32 - screen
01:38 - and set up
01:44 - 500 by 500 in this case
01:47 - and then background color
01:50 - to black
01:55 - all right and then my trello
02:23 - all right so to select a random
02:27 - color for the fireworks we can actually
02:30 - make a list of colors so we can
02:32 - we can then take a random element from
02:34 - blenders and i use that for the color of
02:36 - the fireworks
02:37 - well we're going to start by while
02:40 - making a list called colors and then
02:43 - writing down as many colors as you want
02:46 - well if you want to detail detailed
02:48 - lists of colors so you can use
02:50 - uh we can actually go to the website uh
02:52 - it's called
02:54 - trinket.io there's a bunch of colors
02:58 - that you can actually use and then you
02:59 - can take
03:00 - you can see the name of that and in this
03:02 - case we're just going to
03:04 - add a couple of like uh colors
03:07 - so i'm just going to copy and paste
03:24 - so i have blue red yellow orange purple
03:27 - magna
03:28 - pink lime green gold silver and violet
03:30 - so you can add as many more as you like
03:32 - if you want to
03:33 - okay so now we can actually make some
03:37 - functions
03:38 - so actually draw the fireworks we have
03:39 - to create a function that will be called
03:42 - for each firework that we want to draw
03:44 - the parameter of this function would be
03:46 - the turtle we are going to use to draw
03:48 - the firework
03:49 - we can actually call that t so
04:12 - so we're going to use two random numbers
04:14 - x and y to move the
04:15 - turtle to that position so uh what i'm
04:19 - typing
04:20 - just now is actually creating two random
04:22 - position which is the x
04:24 - and then the y
04:33 - afterwards we're going to generate
04:35 - random numbers using the random integers
04:38 - and while we're going to specify the
04:40 - lower in the files
04:42 - while we already done that so we are
04:44 - going to move the turtle without
04:46 - leaving a trace using pen up before
04:48 - moving the turtle
04:49 - or using go to xy so um we have to
04:52 - pen up first before all or else we're
04:56 - just going to make the
04:57 - whole mess and then we're going to
05:01 - type t go to
05:04 - x and y like that
05:08 - so next we're going to put the pen down
05:10 - and select a
05:11 - random color from the list we already
05:14 - have
05:15 - so t go to
05:19 - x well actually we've done that turn
05:22 - down
05:27 - and then after we did the pen down
05:30 - function
05:31 - we're going to use the well the
05:33 - instruction random dot choice
05:35 - so select the random element from the
05:37 - list colors
05:39 - so
05:47 - like that perfect finally we will create
05:50 - a variable to store the size of the
05:52 - prime work by selecting a random value
05:54 - between
05:55 - well um let's say about 20-100
05:58 - so that it doesn't interfere with the
06:00 - text where we're going to put it on top
06:02 - of the screen
06:04 - so
06:15 - okay so now we can actually create a
06:18 - fireworks
06:19 - the fireworks consist of 36 equal lines
06:22 - that rotate around the same point
06:24 - to create this firework tutorial has to
06:26 - draw a line
06:27 - then rotate we can move the turtle
06:30 - forward backward and then
06:32 - use a for loop to do this for
06:36 - i in range
06:40 - 36 we're going to
06:44 - first forward our pen
06:48 - and then backward
06:57 - then right
07:01 - like that so we finish our base so we're
07:05 - done with the function
07:06 - uh we can now proceed to call the
07:08 - function
07:09 - so cut as many times as you want and
07:13 - i'm going to use well 10 formatted
07:15 - firework number
07:16 - so we're going to use a for loop to call
07:18 - this function repeatedly
07:20 - for the parameter we're going to use the
07:23 - terminal we defined at the beginning of
07:25 - the program
07:28 - so
07:30 - in range
07:34 - 10.
07:42 - and then my turtle like that
07:47 - okay so finally let's code our message
07:50 - at the top of the screen
07:52 - so we're going to use the pen knob and
07:54 - go to so you can move to the top and the
07:56 - center of the screen
07:57 - adjust the numbers depending on the size
07:59 - of the screen
08:00 - change the color to white since the
08:02 - background color is black
08:04 - all right so i will write the messages
08:06 - and write
08:07 - and then the message happy 4th of july
08:10 - type the pen up first
08:41 - and then now while you can specify other
08:43 - options
08:44 - such as the font and then the position
08:46 - of text and then what
08:48 - was the text as as what you want to type
08:52 - change those using align and center in
08:55 - front of equals the type size
08:57 - and wait so after i type happy
09:02 - 4th of july
09:06 - and then
09:37 - this is the final code and well we
09:40 - actually finished everything
09:42 - uh we have the function for drawing
09:45 - and also the pen up and the pen down and
09:47 - then we
09:48 - um create 10 fireworks
09:52 - and then afterwards we're going to
09:54 - generate happy 4th of july
09:56 - after all the fireworks so let's run it
10:15 - so all the artworks are actually showing
10:17 - up
10:18 - and it's in a different position each
10:21 - one has 36
10:22 - strokes and then at the end there's like
10:25 - the happy fourth of july
10:27 - text so that's it for the project
10:31 - so that's for today well hope you liked

10:37 - other videos well

hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share between the friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we are going to make a fireworks animation using python turtle so in this project we will use randomness and drawing patterns to do some of how works and a message for the fourth of july so it just going to pops up some of the fireworks from random places and then after generating a certain fireworks out it would perform it would like shows up happy 4th of july so yeah just like that so let's get started so first of all we will start by creating a new project and importing the turtle and random libraries okay so we will use these two libraries for drawing and putting the fireworks in the random position so first of all we can do import turntable and import random okay after writing these two codes uh we can begin with the general setup of our program in this case we'll set up our screen to any size that we prefer and we'll make one turtle called my turtle head and then with speed zero so uh it's actually up to you with the setup of the size and the width of nsis in this case we're just going to use wn as a variable equals to turtle screen and set up 500 by 500 in this case and then background color to black all right and then my trello all right so to select a random color for the fireworks we can actually make a list of colors so we can we can then take a random element from blenders and i use that for the color of the fireworks well we're going to start by while making a list called colors and then writing down as many colors as you want well if you want to detail detailed lists of colors so you can use uh we can actually go to the website uh it's called trinket.io there's a bunch of colors that you can actually use and then you can take you can see the name of that and in this case we're just going to add a couple of like uh colors so i'm just going to copy and paste so i have blue red yellow orange purple magna pink lime green gold silver and violet so you can add as many more as you like if you want to okay so now we can actually make some functions so actually draw the fireworks we have to create a function that will be called for each firework that we want to draw the parameter of this function would be the turtle we are going to use to draw the firework we can actually call that t so so we're going to use two random numbers x and y to move the turtle to that position so uh what i'm typing just now is actually creating two random position which is the x and then the y afterwards we're going to generate random numbers using the random integers and while we're going to specify the lower in the files while we already done that so we are going to move the turtle without leaving a trace using pen up before moving the turtle or using go to xy so um we have to pen up first before all or else we're just going to make the whole mess and then we're going to type t go to x and y like that so next we're going to put the pen down and select a random color from the list we already have so t go to x well actually we've done that turn down and then after we did the pen down function we're going to use the well the instruction random dot choice so select the random element from the list colors so like that perfect finally we will create a variable to store the size of the prime work by selecting a random value between well um let's say about 20100 so that it doesn't interfere with the text where we're going to put it on top of the screen so okay so now we can actually create a fireworks the fireworks consist of 36 equal lines that rotate around the same point to create this firework tutorial has to draw a line then rotate we can move the turtle forward backward and then use a for loop to do this for i in range 36 we're going to first forward our pen and then backward then right like that so we finish our base so we're done with the function uh we can now proceed to call the function so cut as many times as you want and i'm going to use well 10 formatted firework number so we're going to use a for loop to call this function repeatedly for the parameter we're going to use the terminal we defined at the beginning of the program so in range 10. and then my turtle like that okay so finally let's code our message at the top of the screen so we're going to use the pen knob and go to so you can move to the top and the center of the screen adjust the numbers depending on the size of the screen change the color to white since the background color is black all right so i will write the messages and write and then the message happy 4th of july type the pen up first and then now while you can specify other options such as the font and then the position of text and then what was the text as as what you want to type change those using align and center in front of equals the type size and wait so after i type happy 4th of july and then this is the final code and well we actually finished everything uh we have the function for drawing and also the pen up and the pen down and then we um create 10 fireworks and then afterwards we're going to generate happy 4th of july after all the fireworks so let's run it so all the artworks are actually showing up and it's in a different position each one has 36 strokes and then at the end there's like the happy fourth of july text so that's it for the project so that's for today well hope you liked this video don't forget to subscribe and like our other videos well also check out the other two while you're waiting for other videos okay so see you next time bye
