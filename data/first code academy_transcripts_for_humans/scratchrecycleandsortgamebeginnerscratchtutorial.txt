00:00 - everyone so today we're going to be
00:01 - making a scratch project
00:03 - and in the scratch project it's related
00:05 - to recycling
00:06 - let's have a look at what this project
00:08 - will look like so in this game
00:10 - there will be floating crash and we have
00:12 - to collect it
00:13 - so we have this trash can here
00:17 - so let's click it to start so we can use
00:19 - the left and right arrow
00:21 - to control and collect our card which
00:24 - every time we collect a garbage
00:26 - it gives us a score and in this game we
00:29 - also have a
00:30 - high score so let's see if you can guess
00:33 - what is the high score
00:34 - and when you reach a certain amount then
00:38 - something will happen so i'm using the
00:41 - left and right keys to
00:43 - control the garbage bin and our food is
00:46 - just
00:46 - randomly falling from the sky so once i
00:49 - reached the score of 30 you just now saw
00:51 - that the garbage can said thank you for
00:52 - not littering
00:54 - we can click on create and we are here
00:56 - we're going to call this
00:58 - don't later okay
01:02 - next we're going to remove this cap and
01:03 - then we're going to actually add a
01:05 - background i'm going to click on this
01:07 - and then this is our starting background
01:09 - so you can call this starter
01:13 - okay and then you can click on paint and
01:16 - paint any color
01:20 - then i'm gonna color this here
01:24 - so click on this and cover it
01:27 - now if you want to add some text we
01:29 - click on t
01:31 - change this to black in color and
01:34 - here we can just type in don't litter
01:42 - and this is our backdrop so this is like
01:45 - the starting screen
01:46 - and then we want to add some more
01:48 - information over here so you can
01:50 - click again here and the information
01:52 - we're gonna write
01:53 - is
02:02 - then we can write
02:11 - and then here we can click on this arrow
02:13 - and
02:14 - sort of move this text here same thing
02:17 - for this
02:18 - you can move it here and you can change
02:20 - the color of this you can say oh
02:22 - say i don't want this color make it red
02:25 - and then
02:26 - this you can leave it alone and then
02:28 - what we're going to add down is our
02:30 - garbage can
02:30 - inside in a second so we need to now
02:34 - export our
02:35 - sprites over here so let's see how we're
02:37 - going to do that
02:39 - i'm going to click on this i'm going to
02:41 - click upload sprite
02:43 - so here in upload sprite we click on the
02:45 - folder
02:46 - and we have four of them here so you can
02:48 - press shift and press the down arrow
02:50 - on your keyboard and then click open
02:54 - and once you do that it will start
02:55 - uploading all of them so you can see all
02:57 - of them are here
02:59 - but we have to do a few things so to
03:02 - click on each one of these spreads so
03:03 - you click on costume
03:05 - and we can use the eraser tool that is
03:07 - here
03:08 - and erase all of this so you can see
03:11 - this
03:11 - part is the access part that is not
03:16 - needed
03:19 - then you can move on to the next one so
03:21 - we have the garbage bin and here too
03:23 - clean out any excess stuff
03:30 - and if you make a mistake like this you
03:32 - can actually click back here
03:37 - and then if you think this is too big
03:39 - you can change the sizing
03:46 - then we can click on the apple
03:58 - then you can click on this
04:15 - and then what we want to do is want to
04:16 - change the size i can change these to 30
04:19 - this also can be changed to 30.
04:23 - this can be changed to
04:26 - 60 this can be changed to
04:30 - 30 and then
04:33 - what we need to do is we're going to
04:34 - place this here and if you notice
04:36 - there's still more
04:37 - you can clean it
04:52 - you can just try looking at the image
04:54 - and seeing where
04:55 - you think it may be
05:00 - i think that's okay for now so what we
05:03 - want to do
05:04 - is we want to start coding so first we
05:07 - will have
05:07 - our garbage bin show click on events
05:11 - click on when green flag click and then
05:15 - click on looks and then click on show
05:19 - so what happens when we start our game
05:21 - our garbage can shown and then
05:24 - since we wanted to go to another
05:26 - backdrop we click on
05:28 - events and take out when i click so when
05:31 - this sprite is clicked we want to change
05:33 - to the next spectrum
05:35 - so how we do that is
05:38 - we first add another backdrop so here
05:41 - let me change this to you choose a
05:43 - backdrop
05:45 - say i'll use colorful cd go back to here
05:49 - click back on my code so when spread
05:52 - click i
05:53 - want it to switch backdrop to colorful
05:56 - city
05:57 - and also when i start the game i not
06:00 - only want to show my character
06:02 - i also want to switch the backdrop to
06:06 - start and then when i click it it will
06:10 - say this so then once we started
06:14 - i also wanted to say something right
06:16 - they got save
06:18 - click here say click here
06:21 - to start
06:27 - so click here to start the game and if
06:30 - you
06:30 - want him to constantly say that you can
06:33 - take out a
06:35 - repeat 10 you can just have him repeat
06:37 - saying this
06:38 - 10 times
06:42 - and since these other food items are
06:46 - there
06:47 - what we want to do is when we start the
06:49 - game we want them to be hidden so
06:51 - each one of them take out the green flag
06:55 - put that here click on looks and then
06:58 - take out the
06:59 - height block here we're gonna do the
07:02 - same for the apple
07:04 - so green flag looks and then
07:11 - same thing for the orange green flag and
07:16 - then
07:16 - looks then
07:22 - start all of them are hidden
07:25 - so the next thing is when we
07:29 - now switch back right so we click on
07:33 - events
07:34 - take out when backdrop switch to
07:36 - colorful city
07:38 - and then i would like it to stop
07:42 - show itself and then also go to the
07:46 - position over here so you can drag this
07:48 - here
07:50 - and then you can take out motion
07:54 - go to
07:58 - and on top of that we can have our
08:02 - garbage controlled our garbage bin
08:04 - controlled when we want to move it
08:07 - take out an event take out green flag
08:10 - put that here click on a forever block
08:14 - and we can take out two if statements
08:17 - here
08:18 - and and why we're using the if
08:20 - statements we only want
08:22 - our garbage can to move when we trigger
08:24 - a certain
08:26 - click on sensing take out
08:30 - the key press put that here and put
08:33 - this here so left
08:36 - and right and what we want to do
08:40 - we take out the
08:43 - change x click on motion change
08:46 - x by 10 and put this
08:49 - here but remember when you're going to
08:51 - the left side it's a
08:53 - minus 10. so so far we have this
08:58 - and when we start we can have it here
09:02 - and then click on it it starts here
09:09 - so let me keep on saying this and then
09:12 - we can move our character
09:14 - left and right
09:19 - now we have our food items
09:24 - so what we can do we can say when
09:27 - backdrop switches to
09:29 - colorful cd so say i want to position my
09:34 - character
09:34 - somewhere here right i want to place the
09:37 - button
09:38 - so what i need to do is i click on
09:42 - control
09:43 - take out a forever then i take out a
09:46 - show block here
09:50 - and then a high block
09:53 - so what i'd like to do is i'd like to go
09:56 - to a
09:57 - certain position so right now as you see
10:00 - when i click that the banana is there
10:03 - so if you want to see it first you can
10:05 - click on looks
10:06 - take uh this show block here just click
10:09 - on it
10:10 - once you click on it you can see your
10:12 - banana so i want to place it over
10:15 - here so what i'm gonna do
10:19 - is i'm gonna have it hide i'm gonna have
10:22 - it
10:22 - go to
10:27 - okay and then what i wanted to do
10:30 - is i wanted to show itself
10:34 - and then glide so we'll take out the
10:36 - glide
10:37 - and then we will take out the
10:41 - glide one second but then here since i
10:43 - wanted to go from
10:45 - top to down so we can see here the
10:47 - position is 147
10:49 - and same thing goes here so we're going
10:51 - to change this to
10:52 - minus 147 but the difference is
10:56 - i wanted to randomly like so click on
10:59 - operators
11:00 - take out a pick random put that here and
11:02 - change this to
11:03 - 0.82 one second
11:09 - so let's see how that goes
11:12 - so see here whenever it goes down it
11:15 - goes back
11:15 - up here so it's randomly
11:19 - moving from the top to the bottom
11:23 - and if you want it to be faster you can
11:25 - change this to
11:26 - 3.5
11:31 - here click
11:35 - so now this part is done
11:40 - here then we can click on this apple
11:43 - so as i said we can click on looks and
11:46 - take out a
11:46 - show block click on it and then you see
11:49 - it's here
11:51 - so the same thing i want to be done with
11:53 - is i want to
11:55 - drag it over here
11:58 - then i click on the when backdrop is
12:01 - switched to
12:02 - colorful city then what do i do
12:05 - i click on operators take out a forever
12:08 - block
12:08 - so once again inside whatever we put
12:10 - inside this block will be repeated
12:12 - forever constantly
12:14 - so then i click on looks i take out my
12:17 - hide block
12:18 - and then my shoulder
12:21 - then what i want to do here is i want to
12:24 - click on
12:27 - motion take out the go to xy position
12:31 - here
12:32 - and then show we're going to use a glide
12:34 - block once again
12:36 - but this time again it's going from
12:40 - top to bottom so the x position stays
12:42 - the same
12:43 - this number changes to minus 1
12:47 - 9 and then we have a
12:50 - operator click random put that here
12:54 - change 0.5 to 0.6
12:59 - see this both of them
13:03 - are randomly falling at different
13:05 - timings
13:06 - but they're both coming down so
13:11 - that's what we're going to do for this
13:13 - block same thing for the orange
13:16 - bigger so you take out the
13:22 - when backdrop switch to colorful city
13:25 - click on control take out the forever
13:28 - block
13:29 - and then we want to click on looks and
13:32 - take out
13:33 - hide and then
13:34 - [Music]
13:37 - so then we find the position of the
13:40 - orange which is already here but
13:44 - since we want to see it first and click
13:46 - on looks
13:47 - and then sure once you just click this
13:49 - you can see where your orange is
13:51 - say i bring the orange over here
13:55 - right so it has updated the x and y
13:57 - position
13:58 - and we go to motion take out the x and y
14:01 - put that
14:02 - here and then we want it to glide let me
14:04 - take out this
14:06 - then we're going to change this here
14:10 - to 0.5
14:13 - to zero and then this number
14:18 - is changed to
14:22 - and then what we can do here
14:26 - is once it glides and then it will
14:30 - so let's see how this runs so now you
14:33 - can see
14:34 - that our
14:37 - truths are falling right but
14:40 - you notice they're not falling at
14:43 - different
14:44 - rates we could actually make it more
14:47 - interesting by
14:48 - having them change randomly in different
14:51 - times
14:52 - so here we can put 0.5 to 0.8 we could
14:55 - change this to
14:57 - zero point eight to one second
15:00 - you can change this so this we won't
15:03 - change
15:03 - this will stay the same this we can
15:06 - change it to
15:07 - zero point two two zero point
15:10 - five now it'll look a bit different
15:16 - here you can see they are moving at
15:19 - different intervals
15:21 - try and catch it
15:25 - so the next thing i mentioned is we want
15:27 - to have a score
15:28 - so how do we set up this score it's
15:30 - quite simple it's not
15:32 - that hard we need to make a variable
15:34 - called score actually
15:36 - begin with this so we click on variables
15:40 - click on make a variable and we're going
15:42 - to call it school
15:44 - so now that we have this we want to
15:48 - click on the garbage can you can take
15:50 - out a
15:51 - green flag
15:55 - and then we can say when we
15:59 - start we set the score to zero
16:03 - okay then we click on a forever block
16:07 - and control
16:09 - and then we take on a if block
16:13 - so we're going to use the operators
16:15 - because we're going to check if our
16:17 - garbage can is touching the banana
16:21 - the apple or the orange so let's look at
16:23 - that we
16:24 - take out an operator called four and
16:27 - we're going to put one
16:28 - more so this way we can select three
16:32 - click on sensing click on touching i'm
16:36 - gonna change this to touching banana
16:39 - i'm gonna take out another one change
16:41 - this to
16:42 - touching eaten apple and then take
16:45 - another one here
16:47 - change it to touching on okay
16:50 - and what's gonna happen is whenever it
16:53 - touches it
16:54 - it'll change the score by one click on
16:57 - variable
16:58 - and then we take out chain scored by
17:01 - click on this
17:04 - let's see what happens if we try that
17:06 - out
17:07 - oh you notice there's a problem my high
17:10 - score is too high
17:11 - how can i be touching one thing and the
17:13 - high score is too high
17:14 - so there's a bit of an issue right so
17:16 - how do i solve this
17:18 - there's a pretty simple way of solving
17:20 - this i give it the timer some time to
17:23 - wait before it changes
17:24 - my score again so we can click on
17:27 - control
17:28 - we can take out a weight block and put
17:29 - that here and we're going to change this
17:32 - to a
17:32 - magical number of zero dot five seconds
17:35 - so let's see what happens okay green
17:39 - flag
17:39 - starting zero let's try so now whenever
17:42 - it touches it
17:43 - it changes it only after i touch it it
17:46 - doesn't change it by
17:48 - so much continuously
17:51 - so one thing about the garbage can is
17:53 - repeatedly it says click to start the
17:54 - game
17:56 - so what i can say is when i
18:00 - click the sprite instead of using this
18:02 - repeat
18:03 - it would be a bit annoying you could
18:05 - maybe remove that and just have it say
18:08 - click to start the game for one second
18:10 - so click this
18:14 - there so now we have a
18:18 - fully functioning game and whenever we
18:20 - move
18:22 - we collect a point
18:27 - but we also want to add a high school
18:30 - point
18:30 - so go back here and then we put a
18:34 - another control block here
18:38 - and then we're going to change this to
18:40 - if the score is equal to 30
18:41 - so only under this condition would we
18:45 - have our character say something so our
18:48 - character will say we win
18:49 - so we click on operators take out the
18:52 - equal
18:53 - block and change this to 30 and then
18:56 - click on variables and take on score
18:59 - and put that too so what do we want our
19:01 - character to say
19:02 - we're going to say thank you for not
19:04 - measuring so click on looks
19:06 - and then take out the save block here
19:09 - and put this
19:10 - and say thank you not
19:13 - littering and then change this to one
19:16 - second and then click
19:17 - on control wait one second
19:22 - so that would mean that when we get a
19:23 - score of 30 we say thank you for not
19:25 - littering
19:26 - you wait one second and then we can
19:28 - click on
19:30 - control and take out a stop all block
19:33 - this would mean our whole game stops
19:35 - so let's check it out green flag let me
19:38 - make the screen big
19:39 - in this game we'll have certain garbage
19:41 - we have to collect it and try and catch
19:43 - all the garbage before it gets
19:50 - here
19:59 - [Music]
20:01 - thank you for not literally and then the
20:03 - game
20:05 - and stops a second and then stop and
20:07 - then when we click back again
20:09 - the game will restart so congratulations
20:12 - we've made our don't litter game
20:15 - for more fun tutorials like this please
20:16 - make sure to like
20:18 - share and subscribe to firstcoat academy
20:20 - on youtube for more fun filler tutorials
20:23 - thank you bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

everyone so today we're going to be making a scratch project and in the scratch project it's related to recycling let's have a look at what this project will look like so in this game there will be floating crash and we have to collect it so we have this trash can here so let's click it to start so we can use the left and right arrow to control and collect our card which every time we collect a garbage it gives us a score and in this game we also have a high score so let's see if you can guess what is the high score and when you reach a certain amount then something will happen so i'm using the left and right keys to control the garbage bin and our food is just randomly falling from the sky so once i reached the score of 30 you just now saw that the garbage can said thank you for not littering we can click on create and we are here we're going to call this don't later okay next we're going to remove this cap and then we're going to actually add a background i'm going to click on this and then this is our starting background so you can call this starter okay and then you can click on paint and paint any color then i'm gonna color this here so click on this and cover it now if you want to add some text we click on t change this to black in color and here we can just type in don't litter and this is our backdrop so this is like the starting screen and then we want to add some more information over here so you can click again here and the information we're gonna write is then we can write and then here we can click on this arrow and sort of move this text here same thing for this you can move it here and you can change the color of this you can say oh say i don't want this color make it red and then this you can leave it alone and then what we're going to add down is our garbage can inside in a second so we need to now export our sprites over here so let's see how we're going to do that i'm going to click on this i'm going to click upload sprite so here in upload sprite we click on the folder and we have four of them here so you can press shift and press the down arrow on your keyboard and then click open and once you do that it will start uploading all of them so you can see all of them are here but we have to do a few things so to click on each one of these spreads so you click on costume and we can use the eraser tool that is here and erase all of this so you can see this part is the access part that is not needed then you can move on to the next one so we have the garbage bin and here too clean out any excess stuff and if you make a mistake like this you can actually click back here and then if you think this is too big you can change the sizing then we can click on the apple then you can click on this and then what we want to do is want to change the size i can change these to 30 this also can be changed to 30. this can be changed to 60 this can be changed to 30 and then what we need to do is we're going to place this here and if you notice there's still more you can clean it you can just try looking at the image and seeing where you think it may be i think that's okay for now so what we want to do is we want to start coding so first we will have our garbage bin show click on events click on when green flag click and then click on looks and then click on show so what happens when we start our game our garbage can shown and then since we wanted to go to another backdrop we click on events and take out when i click so when this sprite is clicked we want to change to the next spectrum so how we do that is we first add another backdrop so here let me change this to you choose a backdrop say i'll use colorful cd go back to here click back on my code so when spread click i want it to switch backdrop to colorful city and also when i start the game i not only want to show my character i also want to switch the backdrop to start and then when i click it it will say this so then once we started i also wanted to say something right they got save click here say click here to start so click here to start the game and if you want him to constantly say that you can take out a repeat 10 you can just have him repeat saying this 10 times and since these other food items are there what we want to do is when we start the game we want them to be hidden so each one of them take out the green flag put that here click on looks and then take out the height block here we're gonna do the same for the apple so green flag looks and then same thing for the orange green flag and then looks then start all of them are hidden so the next thing is when we now switch back right so we click on events take out when backdrop switch to colorful city and then i would like it to stop show itself and then also go to the position over here so you can drag this here and then you can take out motion go to and on top of that we can have our garbage controlled our garbage bin controlled when we want to move it take out an event take out green flag put that here click on a forever block and we can take out two if statements here and and why we're using the if statements we only want our garbage can to move when we trigger a certain click on sensing take out the key press put that here and put this here so left and right and what we want to do we take out the change x click on motion change x by 10 and put this here but remember when you're going to the left side it's a minus 10. so so far we have this and when we start we can have it here and then click on it it starts here so let me keep on saying this and then we can move our character left and right now we have our food items so what we can do we can say when backdrop switches to colorful cd so say i want to position my character somewhere here right i want to place the button so what i need to do is i click on control take out a forever then i take out a show block here and then a high block so what i'd like to do is i'd like to go to a certain position so right now as you see when i click that the banana is there so if you want to see it first you can click on looks take uh this show block here just click on it once you click on it you can see your banana so i want to place it over here so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna have it hide i'm gonna have it go to okay and then what i wanted to do is i wanted to show itself and then glide so we'll take out the glide and then we will take out the glide one second but then here since i wanted to go from top to down so we can see here the position is 147 and same thing goes here so we're going to change this to minus 147 but the difference is i wanted to randomly like so click on operators take out a pick random put that here and change this to 0.82 one second so let's see how that goes so see here whenever it goes down it goes back up here so it's randomly moving from the top to the bottom and if you want it to be faster you can change this to 3.5 here click so now this part is done here then we can click on this apple so as i said we can click on looks and take out a show block click on it and then you see it's here so the same thing i want to be done with is i want to drag it over here then i click on the when backdrop is switched to colorful city then what do i do i click on operators take out a forever block so once again inside whatever we put inside this block will be repeated forever constantly so then i click on looks i take out my hide block and then my shoulder then what i want to do here is i want to click on motion take out the go to xy position here and then show we're going to use a glide block once again but this time again it's going from top to bottom so the x position stays the same this number changes to minus 1 9 and then we have a operator click random put that here change 0.5 to 0.6 see this both of them are randomly falling at different timings but they're both coming down so that's what we're going to do for this block same thing for the orange bigger so you take out the when backdrop switch to colorful city click on control take out the forever block and then we want to click on looks and take out hide and then so then we find the position of the orange which is already here but since we want to see it first and click on looks and then sure once you just click this you can see where your orange is say i bring the orange over here right so it has updated the x and y position and we go to motion take out the x and y put that here and then we want it to glide let me take out this then we're going to change this here to 0.5 to zero and then this number is changed to and then what we can do here is once it glides and then it will so let's see how this runs so now you can see that our truths are falling right but you notice they're not falling at different rates we could actually make it more interesting by having them change randomly in different times so here we can put 0.5 to 0.8 we could change this to zero point eight to one second you can change this so this we won't change this will stay the same this we can change it to zero point two two zero point five now it'll look a bit different here you can see they are moving at different intervals try and catch it so the next thing i mentioned is we want to have a score so how do we set up this score it's quite simple it's not that hard we need to make a variable called score actually begin with this so we click on variables click on make a variable and we're going to call it school so now that we have this we want to click on the garbage can you can take out a green flag and then we can say when we start we set the score to zero okay then we click on a forever block and control and then we take on a if block so we're going to use the operators because we're going to check if our garbage can is touching the banana the apple or the orange so let's look at that we take out an operator called four and we're going to put one more so this way we can select three click on sensing click on touching i'm gonna change this to touching banana i'm gonna take out another one change this to touching eaten apple and then take another one here change it to touching on okay and what's gonna happen is whenever it touches it it'll change the score by one click on variable and then we take out chain scored by click on this let's see what happens if we try that out oh you notice there's a problem my high score is too high how can i be touching one thing and the high score is too high so there's a bit of an issue right so how do i solve this there's a pretty simple way of solving this i give it the timer some time to wait before it changes my score again so we can click on control we can take out a weight block and put that here and we're going to change this to a magical number of zero dot five seconds so let's see what happens okay green flag starting zero let's try so now whenever it touches it it changes it only after i touch it it doesn't change it by so much continuously so one thing about the garbage can is repeatedly it says click to start the game so what i can say is when i click the sprite instead of using this repeat it would be a bit annoying you could maybe remove that and just have it say click to start the game for one second so click this there so now we have a fully functioning game and whenever we move we collect a point but we also want to add a high school point so go back here and then we put a another control block here and then we're going to change this to if the score is equal to 30 so only under this condition would we have our character say something so our character will say we win so we click on operators take out the equal block and change this to 30 and then click on variables and take on score and put that too so what do we want our character to say we're going to say thank you for not measuring so click on looks and then take out the save block here and put this and say thank you not littering and then change this to one second and then click on control wait one second so that would mean that when we get a score of 30 we say thank you for not littering you wait one second and then we can click on control and take out a stop all block this would mean our whole game stops so let's check it out green flag let me make the screen big in this game we'll have certain garbage we have to collect it and try and catch all the garbage before it gets here thank you for not literally and then the game and stops a second and then stop and then when we click back again the game will restart so congratulations we've made our don't litter game for more fun tutorials like this please make sure to like share and subscribe to firstcoat academy on youtube for more fun filler
