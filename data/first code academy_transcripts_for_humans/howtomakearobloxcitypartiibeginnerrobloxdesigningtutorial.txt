00:00 - hi everyone welcome back to first code
00:02 - academy
00:03 - and today we're going to take a look at
00:04 - part two of our five part
00:06 - video series on how to build a city in
00:08 - roblox studio
00:09 - i hope you enjoy it in today's video
00:11 - we're going to take a look on how to use
00:13 - the terrain editor
00:14 - to build a simple park how to use the
00:17 - different brushes
00:18 - how to edit the type of terrain that we
00:20 - want and
00:21 - what are the different parts of the
00:23 - terrain editor for
00:25 - by building this park and adding some
00:27 - simple
00:28 - accessories to it will be giving our
00:31 - city a more
00:32 - lively environment so last week
00:35 - we left on the couple of buildings that
00:37 - we built
00:39 - as a sample of how to implement
00:42 - buildings into
00:42 - our city for this week
00:46 - across the street i'm going to build a
00:48 - sample park
00:50 - to show you how to edit the terrain in
00:52 - roblox studio
00:54 - first of all i'll define the area of my
00:56 - park or the size of my park
00:58 - a lot of new block on top of the block
01:00 - that i already have
01:02 - and i'm going to to choose the grass
01:04 - material because i want
01:06 - the block to be the park area
01:10 - i'll do a dark green one perhaps
01:13 - and i'll click here to insert a square
01:16 - block
01:17 - i'll use the scale tool as here
01:22 - to define the size of the park i'll
01:24 - probably
01:25 - have it around here remember i'm going
01:27 - to leave some space to add the streets
01:29 - in a later video
01:32 - we're going to do it like this
01:35 - and maybe here
01:40 - maybe for the straight size i'll leave
01:43 - some extra space better if to have
01:45 - more space and to lack space and then
01:47 - have to change everything after
01:49 - now the reason i put this uh i put this
01:52 - block
01:53 - first is because we want to have some
01:56 - set
01:56 - some sort of starting point for the rest
02:00 - of the terrain to build upon from
02:02 - and it doesn't matter if the color
02:04 - doesn't match what the grass will be we
02:06 - can always change the color over here
02:08 - but the important thing is that it
02:10 - doesn't look awkward if terrain if like
02:12 - mountains or water
02:13 - is just coming out of the concrete area
02:15 - it just doesn't look natural enough
02:17 - and because it's a city we don't want
02:19 - the entire thing to be made out of grass
02:21 - we just want a little section that's why
02:23 - i put the grass over here
02:25 - now i'm just going to make sure it
02:28 - doesn't pop
02:29 - out of the map maybe like here
02:34 - later on you might want to delete the
02:36 - base plate but
02:37 - if it doesn't affect you then you can
02:38 - just leave it there
02:41 - here i can see that there's a little bit
02:42 - of concrete i'm going to make it like as
02:44 - the edge of the map
02:45 - on this part of the of the area
02:50 - and since remember if you want something
02:53 - not to move you have to anchor it so i'm
02:55 - gonna anchor it here
02:57 - let me see if i anchored this one as
02:59 - well before
03:00 - i think i even locked it in
03:03 - yeah this one oh it's anchored already
03:05 - okay
03:06 - oh i was selecting this part while i was
03:09 - editing the
03:11 - properties for this block over here so i
03:13 - mistakenly
03:15 - changed the material of the roof of this
03:16 - one
03:21 - so now that we are
03:24 - in this area over here in your home area
03:28 - of roblox studio you see that we have
03:30 - the
03:31 - toolbox opened and the terrain editor
03:34 - you can toggle them off and on by
03:37 - clicking these two icons over here
03:39 - on the top area i use the toolbox
03:42 - to insert accessories for the park and
03:45 - i'll use the terrain editor to add
03:48 - different types of terrain first of all
03:52 - i'm going to use the add and subtract
03:55 - brushes
03:56 - okay these brushes will raise
03:59 - the level off or map
04:02 - to a given like a given standard it
04:06 - would give to it
04:07 - um how big it really depends on your
04:10 - settings over here so i'm gonna
04:12 - make the toolboxes smaller for now
04:14 - because i don't really need it
04:16 - okay the pivot position just changes how
04:21 - it grows from the base i find that it's
04:24 - not really
04:25 - necessary to change it from the bot
04:27 - which is the
04:28 - uh basic setting the base size
04:31 - is how big you want the terrain to start
04:34 - growing so if you see here i click it
04:36 - and it starts growing from the bottom
04:39 - uh i believe i was using center before
04:41 - yes
04:42 - you can use center and the bigger the
04:44 - brush size
04:45 - the bigger it's going to be the
04:49 - the mountain you're building uh you can
04:52 - use the square
04:53 - shape to raise it uniformly like this
04:57 - remember you click it once and it will
04:59 - it'll keep growing for what you already
05:01 - have
05:01 - sometimes it glitches out a little bit
05:03 - depending on on your computer
05:05 - we can you always make some small
05:07 - adjustments if you make a mistake
05:09 - you can hit command z or com or control
05:12 - z in windows
05:13 - to change it again for example here
05:16 - i can join during this little hill
05:19 - um what i'm going to do now
05:23 - well i'm going to use top now top means
05:26 - that
05:27 - whenever the top of the shape will be
05:30 - attached to wherever you put it here
05:33 - so it's going to give you a more stuck
05:36 - to the base of the
05:38 - of the plate field you know uh it's not
05:40 - going to grow as dramatically as the
05:42 - other two
05:43 - with bot your terrain is going to grow
05:45 - in
05:46 - like very fast
05:50 - you can change the view so you can see
05:52 - it from above make sure you cover all
05:54 - the area
05:56 - uh as you see here i definitely selected
05:58 - the green that is too dark so
06:00 - i can also change it back to a little
06:03 - bit lighter
06:04 - maybe around here maybe it's a bit
06:07 - darker
06:10 - so how do i change this terrain over
06:12 - here for example
06:14 - well i can change it i here have grass
06:16 - selected
06:17 - and i can change it to different
06:19 - materials
06:21 - i'm going to change back to
06:24 - this and i'm going to make it a little
06:26 - bit bigger
06:28 - as you see here this one gives a more
06:30 - natural effect
06:32 - to the area i'm using the
06:36 - second grasp base more as a not really
06:40 - that i'm leaving this as a grass but i'm
06:42 - using it to
06:44 - know what's the shape going to be
06:47 - approximately so i can just delete it
06:50 - later if i don't need it anymore
06:52 - so this is like the ground of the park
06:55 - i'm going to use the
06:57 - round tool maybe i can make it a little
07:00 - bit bigger over here
07:01 - to make a little bit of a hill
07:07 - now once i fill it up i can use center
07:11 - maybe reduce the size of this
07:14 - and i can build a hill in the middle
07:21 - if you try to put it using center bottom
07:24 - again on top of it it will build it
07:27 - over what you already have is a terrain
07:29 - so if you want to make it more
07:31 - even level try to click and drag it so
07:34 - it drags the entire terrain
07:36 - in the same fashion as what you were
07:38 - doing before
07:40 - now the other two controls snap to grid
07:44 - basically means is that if you see
07:46 - there's a white grid over here
07:48 - it sometimes changes angle depending on
07:50 - the size of the
07:52 - of the brush you're using if the brush
07:54 - is too big then maybe it won't but
07:56 - i noticed that if you put a little a
07:59 - very
07:59 - small one it sometimes changes the angle
08:04 - it also depends on your camera like here
08:07 - it's already inclined
08:09 - so if you put it here it will try to
08:11 - build it in a diagonal fashion
08:13 - like this now i don't really want to
08:16 - stick like that of
08:17 - randomness so i'll just delete it but if
08:20 - you want to implement it like that
08:21 - that's that's what this one means
08:24 - now and what i'm going to do now is
08:28 - going to
08:29 - fix this heel so it looks a little bit
08:30 - more natural you you can use the smooth
08:33 - tools
08:35 - as here to
08:40 - as the main name says like smoothing out
08:42 - the surface so it doesn't make the drop
08:44 - that big
08:45 - you can just like shift around here
08:50 - i think we need there here
08:55 - sometimes your terrain might be a little
08:57 - bit rough
08:59 - so you can use this tool to even it even
09:02 - it out
09:04 - okay you can also use the erodes tool
09:08 - make it sink a little bit that's what a
09:11 - road means a road means taking
09:13 - like like rocks a road
09:17 - they get smaller in size as time goes by
09:21 - because of water and other tools so in
09:23 - the terrain context it means making the
09:25 - terrain smaller
09:27 - from what you already have it's
09:28 - different from subtract because subtract
09:30 - will take away the entire
09:31 - chunk we wouldn't want that we just
09:34 - wanted to
09:35 - erode the opposite of growth so
09:42 - for some reason i'm doing it too heavily
09:45 - so i'll just try to moderate my clicks
09:48 - so the heel doesn't like look too ugly
09:53 - the important thing is that the level is
09:55 - correct because later on i can just use
09:57 - the
09:58 - smooth tool to make it look a little bit
10:00 - more natural
10:04 - if you want to as well you can just
10:06 - paint with a
10:07 - different terrain if instead of just
10:10 - using that
10:10 - if you already have some terrain you can
10:12 - just paint it here
10:15 - well i can use the water tool to turn
10:18 - everything into water that is in that
10:21 - part of the map
10:23 - now water is a little bit more tricky
10:24 - i'm gonna use it with top
10:27 - because it will delete basically delete
10:29 - whatever you already have
10:30 - so you might want to grow the terrain
10:33 - first
10:34 - for example here
10:40 - if i want like a lake there and then i'm
10:43 - going to paint it
10:45 - with water
10:50 - so you see this way i make a look like a
10:53 - little container for my lake
10:55 - now of course this one looks kind of
10:58 - weird if you take a look
11:01 - very close to it it might look a little
11:04 - bit weird
11:05 - but i know what i'm going to do i'm just
11:09 - going to
11:10 - put it here and all this like green will
11:14 - disappear
11:15 - once i delete the part that i was using
11:18 - to
11:20 - build this one uh this park so i believe
11:22 - it was the last one
11:24 - if i just delete this part you see that
11:26 - it looks a little bit more natural
11:28 - however because the water is
11:32 - actually not too deep
11:36 - maybe if i increase the size of this and
11:39 - i change it to top
11:42 - there it is okay now i turn everything
11:44 - below it into water
11:46 - and even if i scroll down a little bit
11:49 - you'll see that
11:50 - the container for it also grew just the
11:53 - part where his water
11:55 - it became a lot bigger well because i
11:57 - turn
11:58 - all of this into water so it looks from
12:00 - the top as if you can go inside and swim
12:02 - so i have my little lake i have my
12:04 - little hill
12:06 - and now i can just finish it up by
12:09 - adding some trees
12:10 - for example here i i'll add a couple of
12:13 - pine trees
12:21 - and i just duplicate the same one so i
12:24 - can
12:24 - use it in multiple of them every time i
12:27 - create ctrl d
12:28 - to duplicate that's what i'm doing
12:30 - command d or ctrl d to duplicate it
12:33 - it's going to appear in the same place
12:35 - because i'm using collisions off
12:37 - now i'm going to anchor all of these so
12:39 - they don't fall down
12:41 - once i anchor one like this one if i
12:44 - duplicate it
12:45 - the one i move the clone is also going
12:48 - to be anchored
12:49 - and another good thing is that they
12:51 - adjust to the terrain so they'll if the
12:53 - train is flipped they'll flip as well
12:55 - and what is a park without a bench so
12:58 - i'll just add a bench now
13:03 - usually the parts that have like uh
13:06 - orange
13:07 - is there a little bit more complex than
13:08 - normal ones
13:10 - oh and even if you want you can also
13:14 - with the same terrain editor add a
13:15 - little like a road
13:18 - so i'm going to do that i'm going to use
13:20 - the paint tool
13:22 - i'm going to use a replace tool maybe
13:26 - as a brush i'm going to replace whatever
13:28 - i'm touching
13:30 - uh source material grass replace with
13:35 - asphalt so whatever touches the brush
13:38 - you see is going to become asphalt
13:41 - i'm going to make a smaller brush maybe
13:43 - like three
13:54 - you can always optimize and make this a
13:57 - little bit prettier this is a quick
13:59 - tutorial so
14:00 - i'm just going to do the basics part
14:05 - and this is pretty much how it will look
14:07 - like
14:08 - by using the flatten tool you'll make uh
14:11 - the surfaces less
14:13 - basically like when you have a bunch of
14:15 - dough and you push it down it's just
14:17 - going to
14:17 - grow into the sides that's what the flat
14:20 - tool will do and that's pretty much for
14:23 - all the tools that are
14:25 - mostly useful sea level just indicates
14:29 - where the water
14:30 - will naturally be now this one i don't
14:33 - really
14:34 - have much use unless you want to build
14:36 - like a huge sea
14:38 - for the entire map but since this is a
14:41 - city
14:42 - we don't need to see exactly right now
14:45 - we're just gonna put a little lake over
14:46 - there and that's it now
14:49 - i'm gonna play it to test it out
14:58 - and we can see we can have we have the
15:00 - park i made the pine trees maybe a
15:02 - little bit too short
15:04 - but that's okay maybe they're like baby
15:06 - pine trees
15:08 - and the water now this water the only
15:10 - problem is that it's just the
15:12 - effect of being water uh it's not really
15:14 - like a swimming property
15:17 - it's it's like if grass was made out of
15:19 - water you know
15:20 - but it's mostly for the visual effect
15:25 - and we have the park over here park
15:27 - range
15:30 - and that's it for today i hope you
15:32 - enjoyed this video don't forget to like
15:34 - and subscribe
15:35 - and come back next week for more videos
15:37 - on many different topics
15:39 - goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome back to first code academy and today we're going to take a look at part two of our five part video series on how to build a city in roblox studio i hope you enjoy it in today's video we're going to take a look on how to use the terrain editor to build a simple park how to use the different brushes how to edit the type of terrain that we want and what are the different parts of the terrain editor for by building this park and adding some simple accessories to it will be giving our city a more lively environment so last week we left on the couple of buildings that we built as a sample of how to implement buildings into our city for this week across the street i'm going to build a sample park to show you how to edit the terrain in roblox studio first of all i'll define the area of my park or the size of my park a lot of new block on top of the block that i already have and i'm going to to choose the grass material because i want the block to be the park area i'll do a dark green one perhaps and i'll click here to insert a square block i'll use the scale tool as here to define the size of the park i'll probably have it around here remember i'm going to leave some space to add the streets in a later video we're going to do it like this and maybe here maybe for the straight size i'll leave some extra space better if to have more space and to lack space and then have to change everything after now the reason i put this uh i put this block first is because we want to have some set some sort of starting point for the rest of the terrain to build upon from and it doesn't matter if the color doesn't match what the grass will be we can always change the color over here but the important thing is that it doesn't look awkward if terrain if like mountains or water is just coming out of the concrete area it just doesn't look natural enough and because it's a city we don't want the entire thing to be made out of grass we just want a little section that's why i put the grass over here now i'm just going to make sure it doesn't pop out of the map maybe like here later on you might want to delete the base plate but if it doesn't affect you then you can just leave it there here i can see that there's a little bit of concrete i'm going to make it like as the edge of the map on this part of the of the area and since remember if you want something not to move you have to anchor it so i'm gonna anchor it here let me see if i anchored this one as well before i think i even locked it in yeah this one oh it's anchored already okay oh i was selecting this part while i was editing the properties for this block over here so i mistakenly changed the material of the roof of this one so now that we are in this area over here in your home area of roblox studio you see that we have the toolbox opened and the terrain editor you can toggle them off and on by clicking these two icons over here on the top area i use the toolbox to insert accessories for the park and i'll use the terrain editor to add different types of terrain first of all i'm going to use the add and subtract brushes okay these brushes will raise the level off or map to a given like a given standard it would give to it um how big it really depends on your settings over here so i'm gonna make the toolboxes smaller for now because i don't really need it okay the pivot position just changes how it grows from the base i find that it's not really necessary to change it from the bot which is the uh basic setting the base size is how big you want the terrain to start growing so if you see here i click it and it starts growing from the bottom uh i believe i was using center before yes you can use center and the bigger the brush size the bigger it's going to be the the mountain you're building uh you can use the square shape to raise it uniformly like this remember you click it once and it will it'll keep growing for what you already have sometimes it glitches out a little bit depending on on your computer we can you always make some small adjustments if you make a mistake you can hit command z or com or control z in windows to change it again for example here i can join during this little hill um what i'm going to do now well i'm going to use top now top means that whenever the top of the shape will be attached to wherever you put it here so it's going to give you a more stuck to the base of the of the plate field you know uh it's not going to grow as dramatically as the other two with bot your terrain is going to grow in like very fast you can change the view so you can see it from above make sure you cover all the area uh as you see here i definitely selected the green that is too dark so i can also change it back to a little bit lighter maybe around here maybe it's a bit darker so how do i change this terrain over here for example well i can change it i here have grass selected and i can change it to different materials i'm going to change back to this and i'm going to make it a little bit bigger as you see here this one gives a more natural effect to the area i'm using the second grasp base more as a not really that i'm leaving this as a grass but i'm using it to know what's the shape going to be approximately so i can just delete it later if i don't need it anymore so this is like the ground of the park i'm going to use the round tool maybe i can make it a little bit bigger over here to make a little bit of a hill now once i fill it up i can use center maybe reduce the size of this and i can build a hill in the middle if you try to put it using center bottom again on top of it it will build it over what you already have is a terrain so if you want to make it more even level try to click and drag it so it drags the entire terrain in the same fashion as what you were doing before now the other two controls snap to grid basically means is that if you see there's a white grid over here it sometimes changes angle depending on the size of the of the brush you're using if the brush is too big then maybe it won't but i noticed that if you put a little a very small one it sometimes changes the angle it also depends on your camera like here it's already inclined so if you put it here it will try to build it in a diagonal fashion like this now i don't really want to stick like that of randomness so i'll just delete it but if you want to implement it like that that's that's what this one means now and what i'm going to do now is going to fix this heel so it looks a little bit more natural you you can use the smooth

you can just paint with a different terrain if instead of just using that if you already have some terrain you can just paint it here well i can use the water tool to turn everything into water that

for example here if i want like a lake there and then i'm going to paint it with water so you see this way i make a look like a little container for my lake now of course this one looks kind of weird if you take a look very close to it it might look a little bit weird but i know what i'm going to do i'm just going to put it here and all this like green will disappear once i delete the part that i was using to build this one uh this park so i believe it was the last one if i just delete this part you see that it looks a little bit more natural however because the water is actually not too deep maybe if i increase the size of this and i change it to top there it is okay now i turn everything below it into water and even if i scroll down a little bit you'll see that the container for it also grew just the part where his water it became a lot bigger well because i turn all of this into water so it looks from the top as if you can go inside and swim so i have my little lake i have my little hill and now i can just finish it up by adding some trees for example here i i'll add a couple of pine trees and i just duplicate the same one so i can use it in multiple of them every time i create ctrl d to duplicate that's what i'm doing command d or ctrl d to duplicate it it's going to appear in the same place because i'm using collisions off now i'm going to anchor all of these so they don't fall down once i anchor one like this one if i duplicate it the one i move the clone is also going to be anchored and another good thing is that they adjust to the terrain so they'll if the train is flipped they'll flip as well and what is a park without a bench so i'll just add a bench now usually the parts that have like uh orange is there a little bit more complex than normal ones oh and even if you want you can also with the same terrain editor add a little like a road so i'm going to do that i'm going to use the paint tool i'm going to use a replace tool maybe as a brush i'm going to replace whatever i'm touching uh source material grass replace with asphalt so whatever touches the brush you see is going to become asphalt i'm going to make a smaller brush maybe like three you can always optimize and make this a little bit prettier this is a quick tutorial so i'm just going to do the basics part and this is pretty much how it will look like by using the flatten tool you'll make uh the surfaces less basically like when you have a bunch of dough and you push it down it's just going to grow into the sides that's what the flat tool will do and that's pretty much for all the tools that are mostly useful sea level just indicates where the water will naturally be now this one i don't really have much use unless you want to build like a huge sea for the entire map but since this is a city we don't need to see exactly right now we're just gonna put a little lake over there and that's it now i'm gonna play it to test it out and we can see we can have we have the park i made the pine trees maybe a little bit too short but that's okay maybe they're like baby pine trees and the water now this water the only problem is that it's just the effect of being water uh it's not really like a swimming property it's it's like if grass was made out of water you know but it's mostly for the visual effect and we have the park over here park range and that's it for today i
