00:00 - hello everyone welcome to first code
00:02 - academy today we'll be making a project
00:04 - called talk to me with the use of
00:06 - app inventor in this project you will be
00:08 - learning how to create an application
00:10 - that speaks out a message that you type
00:12 - in using the text box component in app
00:14 - inventor
00:15 - and additionally we will also learn how
00:17 - to make our program
00:19 - say a message that is stop shaking me
00:21 - when we start shaking our phone
00:23 - and once we're at the home page we can
00:26 - begin on clicking
00:27 - create apps so once we're at this page
00:30 - what we can do
00:31 - is we can click on start new project
00:34 - then
00:34 - we can type in our project name so our
00:36 - project name is called talk
00:38 - to me then we press
00:41 - enter it will start building up the
00:43 - screen and the other components
00:45 - so as that is done this is what our
00:49 - mobile screen will look like
00:50 - here are the palette items that we can
00:53 - use
00:54 - and these is where the component shall
00:57 - be
00:58 - we can begin by adding a background
01:00 - color for our application
01:03 - so we click on our screen one and we
01:06 - scroll down
01:07 - and you will see a item that says
01:09 - background color under it it says
01:11 - default
01:12 - so we can click on this and you can
01:13 - change it to any color that you like
01:15 - i'm going to pick the yellow color so
01:18 - i'm going to scroll
01:19 - my mouse down click on yellow and then
01:21 - the background color changes to yellow
01:23 - here
01:24 - the next thing we'd like to add is we'd
01:26 - like to add a button
01:28 - so we can scroll to this take out button
01:31 - and just drag it here and we want to
01:33 - remove the text that is inside
01:35 - so we scroll down and as you see we can
01:39 - click on the button
01:40 - and here we remove this text of text for
01:43 - button one
01:44 - can press on backspace and press enter
01:48 - the next thing we want to add in is a
01:50 - label now a label is known as an area
01:52 - where you can add some text
01:54 - so we can take out the label and put
01:56 - that here
01:59 - so the text for label one has some text
02:02 - inside but we don't want it to keep
02:04 - that same text we want to change it so
02:06 - we want to highlight this
02:09 - backspace enter and we want to change
02:12 - this to
02:13 - click me to
02:17 - talk that exclamation marks you can add
02:20 - that there
02:22 - you can change this text to anything you
02:23 - like you can change it to click button
02:25 - to talk
02:26 - i just changed the click meter and me is
02:28 - referring to this button
02:30 - you can also change the color of this
02:32 - text you can even change the font size
02:34 - of this text so i can change this font
02:36 - size here to maybe
02:37 - 25 and then if i like i can make it bold
02:41 - it
02:42 - i can even make it italic and you can
02:45 - give the text a background color
02:49 - or you can change the text color here so
02:52 - say i want red i can change it to red
02:55 - and then we have these two things and if
02:57 - we want to bring them to the middle
02:59 - and click on screen and then here the
03:03 - align horizontal you can make it
03:04 - centered and this brings the
03:06 - two items in the middle next we want to
03:10 - add an
03:10 - image so we actually have a link with an
03:12 - image over here that says talk to me
03:15 - and to download this image we can click
03:17 - on this download button here and then it
03:20 - shall
03:20 - download the image to our computer
03:23 - the next thing we can do is head back to
03:25 - our mit app inventor
03:28 - and we click back on our button and we
03:31 - scroll down to
03:32 - our image over here so this is where you
03:35 - can pick an image either from
03:37 - your computer or you take one from the
03:39 - internet save it to your computer and
03:41 - then upload it
03:42 - so you can click upload file click on
03:44 - choose file
03:47 - and then here we click on all
03:50 - and then here we click on the app
03:52 - inventor
03:54 - and click open and then we click ok
03:59 - so here we have a button with an image
04:02 - inside
04:03 - so the next thing that we want to add is
04:06 - we want to add something that will allow
04:08 - our program to speak and use our phone
04:11 - to speak we're going to be taking out
04:13 - the text to speech component so when you
04:17 - scroll here you will see media and then
04:19 - you will scroll to this and you take out
04:21 - text to speech
04:22 - and what this does is it will convert
04:25 - anything you put in text
04:26 - to speech and then we can add in
04:30 - a text box so we click on user interface
04:33 - as we scroll down here
04:36 - you should find a text box and you can
04:38 - put that
04:40 - over here so you can add this here
04:44 - so you can type in any text you like
04:46 - here and then when you press the button
04:48 - it'll
04:48 - say it and we have a text to speech
04:52 - component so the next part is we scroll
04:54 - down to
04:55 - sensors and take out accelerometer
04:58 - sensor and we put that here this is
05:00 - going to help us
05:02 - to send feedback from our phone
05:05 - and let it know to the program that our
05:08 - phone is being shook
05:11 - so to do this now we have done with the
05:13 - design part we're now going to start
05:15 - with the coding section
05:17 - so we click on blocks here and what we
05:20 - can do
05:21 - is when we click on button one you can
05:23 - take this out
05:25 - and then we can have your text box right
05:28 - so what we want to do next is
05:32 - you can see here that we have something
05:34 - called text box one dot
05:36 - text so we can take this out and then
05:40 - when we click on the button we want it
05:42 - to say
05:43 - something from our text box so we can
05:45 - scroll here
05:46 - and you'll see a call text to text
05:50 - speech one grab this put that
05:53 - here and then take in the text box one
05:56 - dot text
05:57 - and put this here so what that is going
05:59 - to do is then when we click our button
06:01 - it's going to speak out whatever we put
06:03 - inside the text box and then the next
06:06 - thing we can add
06:07 - is that when we shake our phone so we
06:09 - click on accelerometer one
06:11 - and then we take out accelerometer
06:13 - sensor one dot shaky
06:16 - once we take this out this would mean
06:18 - that we're shaking our phone
06:20 - according to that event we want our app
06:22 - to say stop shaking
06:25 - so we once again click on the text
06:27 - speech and we take this
06:28 - out let me put it inside here and the
06:31 - message is going to be
06:32 - stop shaking me so we click on text
06:36 - we take this out and we put this here
06:39 - and we're going to change this to stop
06:42 - shaking me
06:47 - and once we're done with that we have
06:48 - our two code blocks
06:50 - so button one when we click it our
06:53 - app will send a message telling the
06:56 - phone that oh you need to speak inside
06:58 - what is inside the text box one
07:01 - and the text box one is whatever text
07:03 - we've put inside
07:05 - then we have another piece of code here
07:07 - that says
07:08 - one accelerometer one shaking so this is
07:10 - a sensor which can detect that our phone
07:12 - is shaking
07:13 - and it will send feedback to our app and
07:16 - then our app will understand that okay
07:17 - someone is shaking the phone
07:19 - then the text speech will say say this
07:22 - message of stop
07:23 - shaking me so this is our app
07:29 - we're not going to look at how does it
07:30 - look on the phone and how does it
07:32 - function
07:33 - so first you'd need an android phone and
07:36 - look like this and you would need the
07:38 - mi2
07:38 - app on your phone as well
07:42 - there are two ways to get our
07:43 - application we can click on build
07:45 - and select the app provided qr code to
07:48 - download the application on our phone
07:50 - if we do not want to do that we can use
07:52 - the different way of connecting it to
07:54 - our phone by clicking connect
07:56 - and then ai companion once you click on
07:58 - that you'll see a qr code pop
08:00 - up on your phone you'll have an option
08:03 - that says scan qr code
08:05 - so you can click on it like this and
08:08 - then it will show you
08:09 - this so you can scan your app
08:12 - here and then it will slowly load it on
08:14 - your phone as you see there's a loading
08:16 - bar here
08:17 - and then it should pop up on your phone
08:19 - over here so here
08:20 - is my app so i'm gonna type in something
08:23 - i'm gonna write
08:24 - in first
08:27 - code academy
08:32 - okay then click on done then i'm going
08:35 - to press
08:36 - first code academy so once i click on
08:38 - the button here
08:41 - it will say whatever i put inside the
08:44 - text box
08:45 - so instead if i want to say my name so
08:48 - i'll add in my name so my name is
08:51 - siddharth
08:52 - then i can click there so you can hear
08:55 - it once i click it
08:56 - it says my name and then once you shake
08:59 - the phone
08:59 - stop stop stop stop shaking me stop stop
09:02 - shaking me
09:03 - stop stop so every time you shake it it
09:06 - says stop shaking me
09:07 - so this is how our application works so
09:10 - i hope you had fun making the app thank
09:12 - you very much for joining us and
09:13 - watching this video
09:14 - please like please share this video with
09:17 - your family and friends
09:18 - and also subscribe to our channel as
09:20 - we'll have more videos coming out very

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we'll be making a project called talk to me with the use of app inventor in this project you will be learning how to create an application that speaks out a message that you type in using the text box component in app inventor and additionally we will also learn how to make our program say a message that is stop shaking me when we start shaking our phone and once we're at the home page we can begin on clicking create apps so once we're at this page what we can do is we can click on start new project then we can type in our project name so our project name is called talk to me then we press enter it will start building up the screen and the other components so as that is done this is what our mobile screen will look like here are the palette items that we can use and these is where the component shall be we can begin by adding a background color for our application so we click on our screen one and we scroll down and you

that there you can change this text to anything you like you can change it to click button to talk i just changed the click meter and me is referring to this button you can also change the color of this text you can even change the font size of this text so i can change this font size here to maybe 25 and then if i like i can make it bold it i can even make it italic and you can give the text a background color or you can change the text color here so say i want red i can change it to red and then we have these two things and if we want to bring them to the middle and click on screen and then here the align horizontal you can make it centered and this brings the two items in the middle next we want to add an image so we actually have a link with an image over here that says talk to me and to download this image we can click on this download button here and then it shall download the image to our computer the next thing we can do is head back to our mit app inventor and we click back on our button and we scroll down to our image over here so this is where you can pick an image either from your computer or you take one from the internet save it to your computer and then upload it so you can click upload file click on choose file and then here we click on all and then here we click on the app inventor and click open and then we click ok so here we have a button with an image inside so the next thing that we want to add is we want to add something that will allow our program to speak and use our phone to speak we're going to be taking out the text to speech component so

and the message is going to be stop shaking me so we click on text we take this out and we put this here and we're going to change this to stop shaking me and once we're done with that we have our two code blocks so button one when we click it our app will send a message telling the phone that oh you need to speak inside what is inside the text box one and the text box one is whatever text we've put inside then we have another piece of code here that says one accelerometer one shaking so this is a sensor which can detect that our phone is shaking and it will send feedback to our app and then our app will understand that okay someone is shaking the phone then the text speech will say say this message of stop shaking me so this is our app we're not going to look at how does it look on the phone and how does it function so first you'd need an android phone and look like this and you would need the mi2 app on your phone as well there are two ways to get our application we can click on build and select the app provided qr code to download the application on our phone if we do not want to do that we can use the different way of connecting it to our phone by clicking connect and then

scan your app here and then it will slowly load it on your phone as you see there's a loading bar here and then it should pop up on your phone over here so here is my app so i'm gonna type in something i'm gonna write in first code academy okay then click on done then i'm going to press first code academy so once i click on the button here it will say whatever i put inside the text box so instead if i want to say my name so i'll add in my name so my name is siddharth then i can click there so you can hear it once i click it it says my name and then once you shake the phone stop stop stop stop shaking me stop stop shaking me stop stop so every time you shake it it says stop shaking me so this is how our application works so i hope you had fun making the app thank you very much for joining us and watching this video please like please share this video with your family and friends and also subscribe to our channel as we'll have more videos coming out very soon
