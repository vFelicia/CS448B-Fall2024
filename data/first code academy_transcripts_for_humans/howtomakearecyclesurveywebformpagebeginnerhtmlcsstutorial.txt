00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:04 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:06 - tutorials on scratch
00:08 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we're going to create a web survey
00:14 - form
00:16 - in this project i'll teach you how to
00:18 - make a web online survey form
00:20 - that asks the user about the recycle
00:22 - habits
00:23 - this project will use html and css
00:26 - we also teach you input types such as
00:29 - submit
00:30 - buttons radio buttons check boxes
00:33 - and text boxes there's also a template
00:35 - below in the description to follow along
00:37 - so let's get started so i've opened up
00:41 - the templates
00:42 - from the description below in my
00:44 - codependent io
00:46 - and here we can see the basic structure
00:47 - of our website
00:49 - we have two field sets the first field
00:51 - set
00:52 - as for the personal information like
00:54 - first name last name
00:56 - email and phone number while the second
00:58 - field sets
00:59 - ask the recycling habits that the user
01:02 - has
01:02 - and here are the different types of
01:04 - inputs and different types of questions
01:07 - that are provided for us so we begin by
01:10 - looking at the first
01:11 - field set for the personal information
01:13 - and adding text boxes so that user can
01:15 - put in their own information here
01:18 - so below first name for our label
01:21 - let's add a text box and here we can
01:24 - write
01:24 - inputs type and input
01:28 - specified um that this whole div
01:31 - is going to be a a text box and so we
01:34 - can use
01:34 - input tag for a text box so here we can
01:37 - have input
01:38 - and the type of the inputs will be text
01:40 - because we're expecting
01:41 - text coming in as first name we're given
01:44 - an id
01:45 - of first name so i will write f and then
01:47 - name
01:48 - indicating first name and i also give
01:51 - this
01:52 - uh inputs an id and a name
01:55 - called uh first name as well so fname
01:59 - and then i'll add a small break uh so
02:02 - that
02:02 - the next field will be pushed um to the
02:05 - next line so here i'll add
02:06 - break
02:10 - that so here as you can see in our
02:12 - templates that we have added a text box
02:14 - right next to
02:15 - first name so let's do the same for the
02:18 - other ones
02:19 - um here for the last name i'm going to
02:23 - add once again another text box
02:26 - and the tag for text box is again inputs
02:29 - here we're expecting text again for last
02:31 - name similar to first name so here we're
02:33 - going to say
02:34 - types equals text for id
02:37 - i'm going to give it the id of last name
02:39 - so here i'm going to write l
02:41 - name transfer last name and i'm also
02:44 - going to give it the same name
02:46 - of l name
02:50 - and again i'm going to add two breaks
02:52 - give us some room in our survey
02:56 - and here for emails again we're going to
02:58 - use
02:59 - uh a text box so here we write inputs
03:02 - um for the type however email actually
03:04 - have their own type so we can write type
03:06 - as
03:07 - email and now we do id
03:10 - which we can just write email and set a
03:12 - name for this
03:13 - check uh text box which is also the
03:16 - email
03:17 - again we add two uh breaks
03:21 - to separate the fields so here we have
03:24 - first name
03:25 - a check uh text box last name text box
03:28 - email text box and then lastly phone
03:30 - number um
03:32 - so again we have a text box for a phone
03:34 - number so here we write inputs
03:36 - indicating it's a text box uh type again
03:39 - we just want text for this
03:41 - so we write text the id
03:44 - let's give it an idea phone number with
03:47 - a capital n
03:48 - and no spaces in between and the name
03:51 - will use the same name as the id again
03:53 - so it will be phone number
03:58 - and again we're just going to add two
03:59 - breaks so that
04:02 - it'll be easier for the user to identify
04:04 - between the text boxes
04:06 - and now if you look at our demo in the
04:09 - bottom you see that we have text boxes
04:11 - next to all the personal information
04:14 - now let's take a look at the second
04:16 - field set of our website
04:18 - which asks our user their recycling
04:21 - habits
04:22 - so the first question that we have under
04:24 - here as you can see for label for
04:26 - recycle habits is how often do you
04:28 - recycle
04:30 - and here we want to give the user a
04:32 - couple of options
04:33 - so the first option we will give is
04:35 - daily second is going to be monthly
04:38 - we can also give them weekly and then
04:40 - maybe not sure
04:42 - so there will be four choices for the
04:44 - user and they can only pick
04:45 - one in this case we want to use the type
04:49 - radio buttons which will only allow
04:51 - users to select one of the options
04:53 - that are given so here underneath our
04:56 - line
04:57 - 19 here uh how often do you recycle
05:00 - let's go down and start writing our code
05:03 - so here we are again asking for an input
05:05 - so let's type in inputs
05:07 - and for the type instead of text or
05:09 - email like before where it will provide
05:11 - us a text box
05:12 - let's write type to be radio
05:17 - and let's set the id uh to
05:20 - the corresponding value for each option
05:23 - so
05:24 - the first option i'm going to give is
05:25 - daily so the id for the first one should
05:28 - be called daily
05:30 - and i'm going to assign a name and the
05:32 - name here should be
05:33 - related to the question that's being
05:35 - answered so here we're asking about how
05:37 - often you recycle
05:38 - so i'm just going to write recycle and
05:40 - the value again should be the same as
05:42 - id which in our case for the first one
05:45 - will be
05:46 - daily so after we gave them the option
05:49 - to select
05:50 - this uh button uh daily
05:53 - uh we don't actually know that this
05:55 - button is daily as you can see there's
05:56 - nothing that states that it is daily
05:59 - so let's go underneath and give it a
06:01 - label
06:02 - so here we can just type label and we
06:05 - can type it for
06:06 - uh daily and here
06:10 - we can set the word inside to be daily
06:15 - and we can close the label and
06:20 - add a break so now
06:23 - let's go back and see now we have a
06:27 - checkbox with the daily option right
06:29 - next to it
06:32 - now let's give it a second option here
06:34 - again i'm gonna write input
06:36 - and type of radio and here the id is
06:40 - gonna be
06:41 - weekly this is the second option that we
06:43 - will give the user
06:45 - and the name again is gonna be recycle
06:47 - since this is still part of the same
06:49 - question
06:50 - and the value will be equal to weekly
06:55 - and here again we're going to have label
06:58 - for
06:58 - weekly and here we can just write weekly
07:02 - so that the user can see close the label
07:06 - and again add a break
07:09 - as you can see now we have daily and
07:11 - weekly
07:13 - um let's add the other two options we
07:15 - have real quick so the third option we
07:17 - have
07:17 - again all of these are going to be radio
07:20 - uh
07:21 - or type of radio and then the third
07:23 - option we have is
07:24 - monthly so here we can set id equals to
07:28 - monthly and the name again should be
07:32 - recycled since we're answering the
07:34 - question for recycle
07:36 - and the value should be set equal to the
07:38 - id which in our case
07:39 - is monthly and again let's add a label
07:43 - so the user knows what that
07:44 - button is for so we set a label for
07:47 - monthly
07:49 - and whoops and in there we'll write
07:52 - monthly close the label
07:56 - and add a break so you see now we have
08:00 - monthly as a third option
08:02 - and last option is not sure so here
08:04 - again i'm gonna write um
08:06 - inputs type of radio
08:09 - id um just gonna write not sure
08:13 - name is gonna be recycle and um made a
08:16 - typo up here
08:18 - uh the name field should always be in
08:20 - string so you
08:21 - always need the double parameters to uh
08:24 - quote around the words
08:25 - so here name should be
08:29 - inside the quote um recycle and the
08:32 - value should be equal to not
08:34 - sure same as the id
08:37 - and like we have done before
08:40 - and i've just realized again i've made
08:43 - more typos uh here it should be label
08:45 - not label so yep
08:49 - can't spell so label here label
08:52 - for i'm not sure
08:55 - here we can just write not sure close
08:58 - the label
09:00 - and uh break so as you can see
09:04 - most of these are actually behind the
09:05 - camera so we actually can't see the id
09:07 - the name or the valley of this
09:10 - of these uh buttons but we can see the
09:12 - label
09:13 - um so whatever you put in here should
09:16 - corresponds to the answer
09:17 - um that if they click on this
09:22 - so yeah um that is our first question
09:25 - how often do you recycle and we have
09:27 - given them four options
09:31 - all right so now that we have uh looked
09:34 - at
09:35 - text and email for text boxes
09:38 - as well as radio buttons which only
09:40 - allows us to select one
09:42 - let's take a look at the third fields
09:44 - which is the second
09:45 - question in our recycling habits
09:48 - here the question is what materials do
09:51 - you recycle
09:52 - take all applicable so all of these
09:56 - that are um applicable
09:59 - by the user should be selected um so
10:03 - here um we want to have multiple
10:05 - selection if possible
10:07 - and as you can see in the um
10:11 - the templates here the code for all the
10:14 - options and questions
10:15 - are included however the
10:18 - type of the input is missing so here um
10:21 - since we know that's more than one
10:23 - option
10:23 - is possible we want to use the checkbox
10:25 - option so here in the input type
10:28 - we're gonna write check box like this
10:31 - and we're going to write it for all of
10:32 - these input types so here for input
10:35 - types i'm going to write checkbox
10:38 - and if you really want you can copy and
10:39 - paste them into the checkbox as
10:42 - every one of these will be have
10:45 - type of checkbox for the inputs so here
10:48 - is you see
10:49 - inputs type um just put in checkbox in
10:52 - here
10:53 - okay awesome so i've put checkbox
10:57 - for the types for all of these inputs
10:58 - and now if i just
11:00 - go down you can see that i can select um
11:04 - any one of these and just unselect it by
11:06 - clicking it again
11:08 - cool
11:11 - okay so now i'm looking at um
11:15 - the third question that we have we have
11:18 - under here
11:18 - and obstacles um what obstacles if any
11:22 - keep you from recycling circle off from
11:25 - circle order applies in this case we
11:28 - know that we should use checkbox because
11:29 - more than one
11:31 - of the field could be selected um here
11:34 - however
11:34 - in the templates we are not providing
11:36 - any solutions
11:38 - so um we can simply copy
11:42 - this format with the input type checkbox
11:45 - given
11:45 - id a name and a value and then the label
11:48 - for this
11:50 - and so i'll go over a couple of examples
11:53 - for
11:54 - any reasonable answer but here you guys
11:57 - can put in your own answer if you want
11:58 - um
11:59 - if you have any um kind of ideas on
12:02 - what people might say then um or might
12:05 - pick then you can put that as an option
12:07 - here um i'm gonna put my first option
12:10 - and here i'm gonna set the input type to
12:13 - checkbox
12:15 - i'm just gonna have id called no bins
12:18 - in this case my reasoning this is gonna
12:21 - be i don't have a bin
12:23 - so here the id is going to correspond to
12:25 - the answer once again so id is going to
12:27 - be no bins
12:28 - and i can say obstacle um the name will
12:31 - be obstacle because that is the answer
12:33 - i'm trying to
12:34 - um well that is the question i'm trying
12:36 - to answer
12:37 - i mean and here uh the value will be
12:40 - again the same as the id which is no
12:42 - bins
12:45 - after this i should create a label uh
12:48 - the label should be for
12:49 - no bin so here the label 4 should be
12:52 - including the id
12:55 - here and then inside of the label i'll
12:57 - just write i
12:58 - know bins are available
13:03 - close off the label and add a break
13:09 - as you can see i've added no bins are
13:11 - available
13:13 - let's add one more or a couple more
13:16 - just so you guys can see what kind of
13:21 - things we're doing and then you guys can
13:22 - replicate and just kind of
13:24 - write your own id and your own reasoning
13:26 - below so it's
13:28 - fine if you have more than two or three
13:30 - options
13:31 - um you can have as many options as you
13:33 - want as long as they're all valid
13:35 - here i'm going to say bins full this is
13:38 - another reason
13:40 - name again is going to be obstacle and
13:42 - the value is going to be again
13:44 - fins full same as the id
13:48 - let's create the label for uh bin is
13:50 - full
13:51 - so things full and inside the
13:55 - um label we'll just say bins are full
13:59 - and close the label and add a break
14:04 - so as you can see we have our second
14:06 - checkbox
14:09 - ready to go
14:13 - so i actually have gone ahead and added
14:15 - four more options so the first option
14:17 - i have added without behind the scene is
14:20 - unsure
14:21 - um so i said unsure if products are
14:23 - recyclable
14:24 - um here again we have check box being
14:27 - our type
14:28 - id being insured name being obstacles
14:30 - and value being id
14:32 - um the second one i've added is too much
14:34 - um time consuming or too much time is
14:36 - needed
14:37 - so too much time consuming
14:40 - or too time consuming the third option
14:43 - is we don't know where to recycle
14:46 - and the fourth option is that we don't
14:47 - care about recycling so
14:49 - in total we have six options now so
14:52 - including the two that we did on camera
14:55 - uh now we have six options and uh yeah
14:59 - so they have the same uh parameters in
15:01 - terms of
15:02 - type and name but the id and value which
15:06 - is the same
15:06 - should corresponds to the individual
15:08 - answers that we have
15:10 - so here are the uh some of the ideas for
15:12 - you to pick
15:13 - um that's an answer so now let's look
15:16 - down that's our
15:17 - at our next question here we have do you
15:21 - have any
15:22 - uh recycling collection points where you
15:24 - live and here we are actually given a
15:26 - selection of
15:27 - four options and here we don't
15:31 - actually have all four options yet as
15:33 - you can see and in the drop bar you can
15:35 - just see that there are four options
15:36 - available
15:37 - but none of them actually are filled in
15:40 - because we haven't filled in the option
15:43 - values here
15:44 - um so you want to keep the first option
15:47 - as error
15:48 - just you know in case the user don't
15:50 - have an answer for us
15:52 - here we can start writing our other
15:55 - options that the user can't pick
15:56 - on the first option i'm going to write
15:58 - is not sure um
16:00 - second option is probably yes and then
16:02 - followed by now
16:03 - so i'll give the user three different
16:06 - choices
16:07 - it's going to be not sure yes and no
16:11 - or they can just pick nothing in this
16:12 - case it will be the error
16:14 - so let's do not sure first so value of
16:17 - not sure
16:18 - and inside here we can just write not
16:20 - short so the user knows that this option
16:22 - for not sure
16:24 - now let's do yes so i'll just write the
16:26 - value as yes
16:28 - and um in the text i'll write yes so the
16:30 - user knows this
16:31 - corresponds to the answer yes and lastly
16:34 - we have no
16:36 - and again we'll put no here
16:39 - and now you see that we have filled up
16:41 - the four options and if you go down
16:43 - to this question and we go to selection
16:45 - we can see that yes
16:47 - no and not sure is a part of our
16:49 - selection
16:50 - so now we have three more questions uh
16:53 - which is what types of bag does your
16:55 - family use for shopping and do you
16:56 - believe recycling is
16:58 - important and any general comments about
17:00 - the recycling program
17:02 - um so for the first two fields we see
17:04 - that uh we should
17:05 - be able to select one options because
17:07 - here is asking for what type of bag so
17:09 - we should only be able to select one
17:12 - and here do you believe recycling is
17:14 - important again we should only be able
17:15 - to select one option because
17:18 - you cannot have two opinions on the same
17:20 - thing
17:21 - um so here in um our first question that
17:24 - we looked at
17:25 - what type of bag does your family use
17:27 - for shopping
17:28 - um we know that since we can only select
17:31 - one option
17:32 - we should use the radio type again so
17:35 - here for the type
17:36 - i'm gonna write radio all right
17:40 - and um here for input type i'm gonna
17:43 - write radio again
17:46 - radio
17:50 - and here this is a second question do
17:53 - you believe recycling is important
17:55 - again we want to use the radio type for
17:58 - the input
17:59 - so radio radio and now if we look down
18:04 - we can select one of the options but not
18:06 - all of them
18:08 - just like we wanted
18:12 - and a quick spot at some typo actually
18:16 - from the templates we see that here it
18:17 - says input type
18:19 - um id is plastic however we put the
18:21 - label for
18:22 - paper and here we have a layer of paper
18:25 - and
18:26 - they actually both plastic so let's just
18:28 - switch that real quick um
18:30 - it's not a big deal so here instead of
18:33 - paper
18:33 - um we should have a label for plastic
18:36 - and instead of the label saying paper
18:38 - we'll say plastic
18:40 - and here the label should be for paper
18:44 - and the label should also say paper and
18:47 - let's just add the
18:49 - label type here reusable bag
18:54 - again this label 4 should match the id
18:57 - above and again we'll just do um
19:00 - label for here real quick
19:08 - awesome
19:10 - and uh quickly um here are actually our
19:13 - second question does not contain the
19:15 - label for so here
19:17 - we're just gonna write the label and
19:19 - here remember that the name
19:21 - corresponds to the label that we use for
19:23 - the question so here
19:24 - recycle important uh is the name so here
19:28 - we're going to say
19:28 - label 4 recycle importance i just copy
19:32 - and paste this name over here
19:35 - and so for the last question uh again
19:38 - we're gonna
19:39 - need to pull in the label for the actual
19:41 - question
19:42 - which will be the same as the name
19:43 - here's general comments so we can just
19:45 - write general
19:47 - comments and make sure it's spelt the
19:49 - same way as the name
19:51 - and lastly for the input type um we just
19:53 - want the user to be able to type
19:54 - something so here we want them to have
19:56 - some kind of text box so we can just
19:58 - write text
20:00 - indicating text box and yeah
20:03 - so now we have our questions and the
20:09 - options or answers formatted correctly
20:12 - and we can move on to the css part of
20:14 - this project
20:17 - and actually before we move to css we're
20:19 - missing one key components which is the
20:21 - submit button as you see we're
20:24 - um almost complete with our html
20:28 - we have all the fields and all the
20:30 - selection for the user
20:31 - however we do not have a submit button
20:34 - so there's no way for the user after
20:35 - filling out the forms to submit it
20:37 - so at the bottom here let's add a button
20:40 - for submit
20:41 - and so here we have input and for the
20:44 - type
20:44 - it's gonna equal to submit this is the
20:46 - submit button
20:48 - and the value we're going to set it to
20:50 - submit as well
20:54 - and on the bottom uh we'll just add
20:58 - bricks and then we can write
21:02 - a link here the link will just
21:05 - um be empty for now and
21:09 - we can write show survey results
21:13 - after submitting
21:18 - form slash a and we can put the link
21:21 - so that the user can see their
21:23 - submission or the result
21:25 - um in here inside of this a
21:29 - now when we save it we see that we have
21:32 - a submit button as well as a link
21:34 - that will point our user to the results
21:36 - of the server
21:41 - all right let's move to the css part um
21:44 - so in the css part the first thing i'm
21:45 - going to do is import some fonts from
21:47 - the google api
21:49 - um so to import something we can do at
21:51 - import
21:52 - um here we're going to include the url
21:54 - where the api is called and
21:56 - inside of it we're going to put the link
21:57 - of the api
21:59 - here we're gonna have um this url that
22:02 - will call
22:03 - and get the uh monster at uh font for us
22:06 - which is what we wanted now let's
22:10 - style our websites
22:14 - here let's just style our overall body
22:17 - to be
22:17 - uh to begin with first i want my body to
22:20 - have a background color so that it's not
22:22 - plain white
22:24 - and let's set a light green color um
22:26 - similar to the
22:28 - environment and following the recycling
22:30 - theme here
22:31 - [Music]
22:33 - next let's turn the color for text to
22:36 - black
22:38 - and let's add margin to automatic so
22:40 - that um
22:42 - we can have more space and more um
22:45 - or it seems more spacious next
22:48 - let's make the text aligned um to be
22:51 - justified
22:53 - and let's set the font weight
22:56 - to be fuller
23:00 - bolder like that and let's set the fonts
23:03 - family to the
23:04 - fonts we imported which is one serrat
23:09 - and we're just gonna use sans surfy
23:13 - okay
23:17 - and uh now we can start styling our link
23:21 - at the bottom here so go down uh we can
23:25 - select the link which is
23:26 - a under tag a and we can set it
23:30 - with a color of zero zero zero zero ee
23:34 - so four zeros and two e's and this will
23:37 - highlight it blue
23:39 - now let's do our css on our field sets
23:42 - so here i'm gonna write shield sets
23:44 - [Music]
23:46 - and let's add the background color to
23:48 - begin with and here i'm going to use
23:51 - this tag called f9 fa
23:55 - fc up to the spectacular color
23:58 - and it's pretty beige white and you'll
24:01 - go over
24:02 - the green background that we have for
24:04 - the body
24:05 - uh next let's add some margin top and we
24:08 - add two percent
24:09 - to the margin top um let's again add
24:12 - some margin to the left now
24:14 - and we'll put 10 percent for margin left
24:18 - and now we also add margin bottom
24:21 - here we add three percent um
24:24 - and then we add a width for this
24:27 - uh field set and we will set the width
24:30 - to be 70 percent
24:34 - so now you see that we have kind of
24:39 - lessened the size of this field set and
24:41 - centralized a little bit more
24:44 - next we're going to add a webkit border
24:47 - and so here we're going to say
24:48 - uh webkit border
24:51 - dash radius and the radius we're going
24:54 - to have is 8 pixels
24:57 - and now let's also add um this
25:01 - mohs border
25:04 - and we set the radius for this also to
25:06 - eight pixels
25:08 - and now we just add in case none of
25:11 - these work we add
25:12 - just a normal border here got eight
25:14 - pixels again
25:18 - so now you can see we have the border on
25:21 - our
25:21 - um shield set
25:25 - and now um let's take a look at these
25:27 - titles
25:28 - here as you can see in our html we have
25:31 - it
25:31 - underneath the tag legend so let's
25:33 - format legend
25:34 - and to change the recycling habits and
25:38 - personal information text
25:39 - so here we'll type legend
25:42 - i'll begin by starting to change the
25:46 - background color
25:47 - and i'll change it to purple next i'll
25:50 - change the text to white
25:53 - and i'll also add a padding on 5 pixels
25:56 - on the
25:57 - top and right and 10 pixel in the left
26:00 - and bottom
26:01 - right and i also give an order
26:04 - of solid 1 pixel and the color black
26:10 - awesome now again i would do something
26:12 - similar with the border here i'll add
26:15 - a web uh here the webkit should have a
26:19 - dash here
26:20 - i had a web kit a border
26:23 - of radius um again we add uh eight
26:26 - pixels
26:28 - and if that doesn't work we'll try most
26:30 - border slash radius
26:32 - again we have eight pixels and if that
26:35 - again doesn't work i'll add
26:36 - just a normal border radius of 8 pixels
26:40 - and finally i'm just going to add
26:41 - padding of 6 pixel
26:43 - on every side to give a little bit more
26:45 - room
26:47 - i see our legend text is formatted
26:50 - nicely
26:55 - so the last uh two minor things where
26:58 - they do for css
26:59 - is the inputs and the title
27:02 - um so here let's do the inputs real
27:04 - quick
27:05 - um for inputs are we adding is a margin
27:07 - of 5 pixels
27:10 - and for the title which we have labeled
27:13 - as
27:13 - using an id so we have to identify it
27:16 - using an id
27:17 - idf title let's add a margin of top from
27:20 - 30
27:21 - uh 30 pixels set the text
27:25 - to centralized by setting the text align
27:27 - to center
27:28 - and i'll increase the size of the fonts
27:30 - by setting the font size to 30.
27:35 - awesome so now if you just take a look
27:37 - at our
27:38 - website as you can see we have our two
27:42 - field sets with each
27:44 - questions and text box and here you can
27:46 - select options
27:48 - and whatnot and then we have a submit
27:49 - button so yeah
27:52 - that is uh the whole project so that's
27:54 - all for today in today's tutorial we
27:56 - learned to make a simple
27:58 - web survey form we made use of html to
28:01 - structure the different input types
28:03 - like radio buttons submit buttons
28:06 - text boxes and check boxes we also use
28:09 - css to design our
28:11 - question elements feel free

28:25 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a web survey form in this project i'll teach you how to make a web online survey form that asks the user about the recycle habits this project will use html and css we also teach you input types such as submit buttons radio buttons check boxes and text boxes there's also a template below in the description to follow along so let's get started so i've opened up the templates from the description below in my codependent io and here we can see the basic structure of our website we have two field sets the first field set as for the personal information like first name last name email and phone number while the second field sets ask the recycling habits that the user has and here are the different types of inputs and different types of questions that are provided for us so we begin by looking at the first field set for the personal information and adding text boxes so that user can put in their own information here so below first name for our label let's add a text box and here we can write inputs type and input specified um that this whole div is going to be a a text box and so we can use input tag for a text box so here we can have input and the type of the inputs will be text because we're expecting text coming in as first name we're given an id of first name so i will write f and then name indicating first name and i also give this uh inputs an id and a name called uh first name as well so fname and then i'll add a small break uh so that the next field will be pushed um to the next line so here i'll add break that so here as you can see in our templates that we have added a text box right next to first name so let's do the same for the other ones um here for the last name i'm going to add once again another text box and the tag for text box is again inputs here we're expecting text again for last name similar to first name so here we're going to say types equals text for id i'm going to give it the id of last name so here i'm going to write l name transfer last name and i'm also going to give it the same name of l name and again i'm going to add two breaks give us some room in our survey and here for emails again we're going to use uh a text box so here we write inputs um for the type however email actually have their own type so we can write type as email and now we do id which we can just write email and set a name for this check uh text box which is also the email again we add two uh breaks to separate the fields so here we have first name a check uh text box last name text box email text box and then lastly phone number um so again we have a text box for a phone number so here we write inputs indicating it's a text box uh type again we just want text for this so we write text the id let's give it an idea phone number with a capital n and no spaces in between and the name will use the same name as the id again so it will be phone number and again we're just going to add two breaks so that it'll be easier for the user to identify between the text boxes and now if you look at our demo in the bottom you see that we have text boxes next to all the personal information now let's take a look at the second field set of our website which asks our user their recycling habits so the first question that we have under here as you can see for label for recycle habits is how often do you recycle and here we want to give the user a couple of options so the first option we will give is daily second is going to be monthly we can also give them weekly and then maybe not sure so there will be four choices for the user and they can only pick one in this case we want to use the type radio buttons which will only allow users to select one of the options that are given so here underneath our line 19 here uh how often do you recycle let's go down and start writing our code so here we are again asking for an input so let's type in inputs and for the type instead of text or email like before where it will provide us a text box let's write type to be radio and let's set the id uh to the corresponding value for each option so the first option i'm going to give is daily so the id for the first one should be called daily and i'm going to assign a name and the name here should be related to the question that's being answered so here we're asking about how often you recycle so i'm just going to write recycle and the value again should be the same as id which in our case for the first one will be daily so after we gave them the option to select this uh button uh daily uh we don't actually know that this button is daily as you can see there's nothing that states that it is daily so let's go underneath and give it a label so here we can just type label and we can type it for uh daily and here we can set the word inside to be daily and we can close the label and add a break so now let's go back and see now we have a checkbox with the daily option right next to it now let's give it a second option here again i'm gonna write input and type of radio and here the id is gonna be weekly this is the second option that we will give the user and the name again is gonna be recycle since this is still part of the same question and the value will be equal to weekly and here again we're going to have label for weekly and here we can just write weekly so that the user can see close the label and again add a break as you can see now we have daily and weekly um let's add the other two options we have real quick so the third option we have again all of these are going to be radio uh or type of radio and then the third option we have is monthly so here we can set id equals to monthly and the name again should be recycled since we're answering the question for recycle and the value should be set equal to the id which in our case is monthly and again let's add a label so the user knows what that button is for so we set a label for monthly and whoops and in there we'll write monthly close the label and add a break so you see now we have monthly as a third option and last option is not sure so here again i'm gonna write um inputs type of radio id um just gonna write not sure name is gonna be recycle and um made a typo up here uh the name field should always be in string so you always need the double parameters to uh quote around the words so here name should be inside the quote um recycle and the value should be equal to not sure same as the id and like we have done before and i've just realized again i've made more typos uh here it should be label not label so yep can't spell so label here label for i'm not sure here we can just write not sure close the label and uh break so as you can see most of these are actually behind the camera so we actually can't see the id the name or the valley of this of these uh buttons but we can see the label um so whatever you put in here should corresponds to the answer um that if they click on this so yeah um that is our first question how often do you recycle and we have given them four options all right so now that we have uh looked at text and email for text boxes as well as radio buttons which only allows us to select one let's take a look at the third fields which is the second question in our recycling habits here the question is what materials do you recycle take all applicable so all of these that are um applicable by the user should be selected um so here um we want to have multiple selection if possible and as you can see in the um the templates here the code for all the options and questions are included however the type of the input is missing so here um since we know that's more than one option is possible we want to use the checkbox option so here in the input type we're gonna write check box like this and we're going to write it for all of these input types so here for input types i'm going to write checkbox and if you really want you can copy and paste them into the checkbox as every one of these will be have type of checkbox for the inputs so here is you see inputs type um just put in checkbox in here okay awesome so i've put checkbox for the types for all of these inputs and now if i just go down you can see that i can select um any one of these and just unselect it by clicking it again cool okay so now i'm looking at um the third question that we have we have under here and obstacles um what obstacles if any keep you from recycling circle off from circle order applies in this case we know that we should use checkbox because more than one of the field could be selected um here however in the templates we are not providing any solutions so um we can simply copy this format with the input type checkbox given id a name and a value and then the label for this and so i'll go over a couple of examples for any reasonable answer but here you guys can put in your own answer if you want um if you have any um kind of ideas on what people might say then um or might pick then you can put that as an option here um i'm gonna put my first option and here i'm gonna set the input type to checkbox i'm just gonna have id called no bins in this case my reasoning this is gonna be i don't have a bin so here the id is going to correspond to the answer once again so id is going to be no bins and i can say obstacle um the name will be obstacle because that is the answer i'm trying to um well that is the question i'm trying to answer i mean and here uh the value will be again the same as the id which is no bins after this i should create a label uh the label should be for no bin so here the label 4 should be including the id here and then inside of the label i'll just write i know bins are available close off the label and add a break as you can see i've added no bins are available let's add one more or a couple more just so you guys can see what kind of things we're doing and then you guys can replicate and just kind of write your own id and your own reasoning below so it's fine if you have more than two or three options um you can have as many options as you want as long as they're all valid here i'm going to say bins full this is another reason name again is going to be obstacle and the value is going to be again fins full same as the id let's create the label for uh bin is full so things full and inside the um label we'll just say bins are full and close the label and add a break so as you can see we have our second checkbox ready to go so i actually have gone ahead and added four more options so the first option i have added without behind the scene is unsure um so i said unsure if products are recyclable um here again we have check box being our type id being insured name being obstacles and value being id um the second one i've added is too much um time consuming or too much time is needed so too much time consuming or too time consuming the third option is we don't know where to recycle and the fourth option is that we don't care about recycling so in total we have six options now so including the two that we did on camera uh now we have six options and uh yeah so they have the same uh parameters in terms of type and name but the id and value which is the same should corresponds to the individual answers that we have so here are the uh some of the ideas for you to pick um that's an answer so now let's look down that's our at our next question here we have do you have any uh recycling collection points where you live and here we are actually given a selection of four options and here we don't actually have all four options yet as you can see and in the drop bar you can just see that there are four options available but none of them actually are filled in because we haven't filled in the option values here um so you want to keep the first option as error just you know in case the user don't have an answer for us here we can start writing our other options that the user can't pick on the first option i'm going to write is not sure um second option is probably yes and then followed by now so i'll give the user three different choices it's going to be not sure yes and no or they can just pick nothing in this case it will be the error so let's do not sure first so value of not sure and inside here we can just write not short so the user knows that this option for not sure now let's do yes so i'll just write the value as yes and um in the text i'll write yes so the user knows this corresponds to the answer yes and lastly we have no and again we'll put no here and now you see that we have filled up the four options and if you go down to this question and we go to selection we can see that yes no and not sure is a part of our selection so now we have three more questions uh which is what types of bag does your family use for shopping and do you believe recycling is important and any general comments about the recycling program um so for the first two fields we see that uh we should be able to select one options because here is asking for what type of bag so we should only be able to select one and here do you believe recycling is important again we should only be able to select one option because you cannot have two opinions on the same thing um so here in um our first question that we looked at what type of bag does your family use for shopping um we know that since we can only select one option we should use the radio type again so here for the type i'm gonna write radio all right and um here for input type i'm gonna write radio again radio and here this is a second question do you believe recycling is important again we want to use the radio type for the input so radio radio and now if we look down we can select one of the options but not all of them just like we wanted and a quick spot at some typo actually from the templates we see that here it says input type um id is plastic however we put the label for paper and here we have a layer of paper and they actually both plastic so let's just switch that real quick um it's not a big deal so here instead of paper um we should have a label for plastic and instead of the label saying paper we'll say plastic and here the label should be for paper and the label should also say paper and let's just add the label type here reusable bag again this label 4 should match the id above and again we'll just do um label for here real quick awesome and uh quickly um here are actually our second question does not contain the label for so here we're just gonna write the label and here remember that the name corresponds to the label that we use for the question so here recycle important uh is the name so here we're going to say label 4 recycle importance i just copy and paste this name over here and so for the last question uh again we're gonna need to pull in the label for the actual question which will be the same as the name here's general comments so we can just write general comments and make sure it's spelt the same way as the name and lastly for the input type um we just want the user to be able to type something so here we want them to have some kind of text box so we can just write text indicating text box and yeah so now we have our questions and the options or answers formatted correctly and we can move on to the css part of this project and actually before we move to css we're missing one key components which is the submit button as you see we're um almost complete with our html we have all the fields and all the selection for the user however we do not have a submit button so there's no way for the user after filling out the forms to submit it so at the bottom here let's add a button for submit and so here we have input and for the type it's gonna equal to submit this is the submit button and the value we're going to set it to submit as well and on the bottom uh we'll just add bricks and then we can write a link here the link will just um be empty for now and we can write show survey results after submitting form slash a and we can put the link so that the user can see their submission or the result um in here inside of this a now when we save it we see that we have a submit button as well as a link that will point our user to the results of the server all right let's move to the css part um so in the css part the first thing i'm going to do is import some fonts from the google api um so to import something we can do at import um here we're going to include the url where the api is called and inside of it we're going to put the link of the api here we're gonna have um this url that will call and get the uh monster at uh font for us which is what we wanted now let's style our websites here let's just style our overall body to be uh to begin with first i want my body to have a background color so that it's not plain white and let's set a light green color um similar to the environment and following the recycling theme here next let's turn the color for text to black and let's add margin to automatic so that um we can have more space and more um or it seems more spacious next let's make the text aligned um to be justified and let's set the font weight to be fuller bolder like that and let's set the fonts family to the fonts we imported which is one serrat and we're just gonna use sans surfy okay and uh now we can start styling our link at the bottom here so go down uh we can select the link which is a under tag a and we can set it with a color of zero zero zero zero ee so four zeros and two e's and this will highlight it blue now let's do our css on our field sets so here i'm gonna write shield sets and let's add the background color to begin with and here i'm going to use this tag called f9 fa fc up to the spectacular color and it's pretty beige white and you'll go over the green background that we have for the body uh next let's add some margin top and we add two percent to the margin top um let's again add some margin to the left now and we'll put 10 percent for margin left and now we also add margin bottom here we add three percent um and then we add a width for this uh field set and we will set the width to be 70 percent so now you see that we have kind of lessened the size of this field set and centralized a little bit more next we're going to add a webkit border and so here we're going to say uh webkit border dash radius and the radius we're going to have is 8 pixels and now let's also add um this mohs border and we set the radius for this also to eight pixels and now we just add in case none of these work we add just a normal border here got eight pixels again so now you can see we have the border on our um shield set and now um let's take a look at these titles here as you can see in our html we have it underneath the tag legend so let's format legend and to change the recycling habits and personal information text so here we'll type legend i'll begin by starting to change the background color and i'll change it to purple next i'll change the text to white and i'll also add a padding on 5 pixels on the top and right and 10 pixel in the left and bottom right and i also give an order of solid 1 pixel and the color black awesome now again i would do something similar with the border here i'll add a web uh here the webkit should have a dash here i had a web kit a border of radius um again we add uh eight pixels and if that doesn't work we'll try most border slash radius again we have eight pixels and if that again doesn't work i'll add just a normal border radius of 8 pixels and finally i'm just going to add padding of 6 pixel on every side to give a little bit more room i see our legend text is formatted nicely so the last uh two minor things where they do for css is the inputs and the title um so here let's do the inputs real quick um for inputs are we adding is a margin of 5 pixels and for the title which we have labeled as using an id so we have to identify it using an id idf title let's add a margin of top from 30 uh 30 pixels set the text to centralized by setting the text align to center and i'll increase the size of the fonts by setting the font size to 30. awesome so now if you just take a look at our website as you can see we have our two field sets with each questions and text box and here you can select options and whatnot and then we have a submit button so yeah that is uh the whole project so that's all for today in today's tutorial we learned to make a simple web survey form we made use of html to structure the different input types like radio buttons submit buttons text boxes and check boxes we also use css to design our question elements feel free to make any changes to the website um as you see fit make sure to subscribe to our channel um to check out the next section of this project i hope you guys enjoyed i thank you bye bye
