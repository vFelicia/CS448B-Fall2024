00:00 - so if you guys remember last few
00:02 - sessions we did this project that is
00:04 - related to the coronavirus situation as
00:08 - well that we want ourselves to eat more
00:11 - vitamin which is orange and dodge away
00:14 - from the virus and each time the monkey
00:18 - eats the orange we gain some points and
00:22 - then each time the virus hit the monkey
00:26 - you see so yeah we lose one score and if
00:32 - you guys like on my project you would be
00:34 - able to see the remix button as well and
00:37 - because this is already my project I
00:40 - don't see the remix button there and
00:45 - what I'll do is to go inside and I want
00:50 - to make some adjustment to this project
00:54 - and so I think the adjustment that I'm
00:59 - gonna make is to simply have an
01:01 - additional source of vitamin such that
01:05 - my monkey could be healthier and let's
01:09 - do that so let's say this additional
01:16 - feature of our game is whenever we press
01:21 - the spacebar an apple would appear on
01:26 - the screen so just so just now what I
01:31 - did perfectly was click on choose the
01:34 - sprites at the bottom right corner and
01:38 - this will pop up and yeah basically I am
01:42 - choosing the Apple it could be a banana
01:46 - or other things as well so so yeah you
01:54 - can see the sprite is here and what we
01:59 - want to do is to simply go back to the
02:03 - orange so remember the orange is already
02:06 - kind of doing what we want the apple to
02:08 - do which is to move from the left
02:11 - side of the screen all the way to the
02:14 - right hand side and after they after it
02:18 - hits the edge of the wall off the screen
02:21 - it will come back to the left side and
02:23 - then go all the way again and every time
02:28 - the orange hit the monkey the score goes
02:33 - up by five so it's pretty much what we
02:37 - want except that this time we're not
02:40 - asking the Apple to change to start
02:45 - moving with space but we want the Apple
02:49 - to start moving closer so we want we
02:53 - don't want the Apple to start moving
02:54 - with a green flag but we want the Apple
02:57 - to start moving with the same Sparky so
03:01 - what we want to do just now I quickly
03:03 - did was to click a duplicate function
03:09 - and I'm going to drop that into Apple
03:17 - okay so the duplicate function is
03:20 - slightly problematic sometimes but just
03:24 - have to do it a few times yeah you can
03:29 - see that here also kind of like has to
03:32 - duplicate it here so now that I have
03:35 - this one you can see that this is a
03:37 - forever block and has the Apple every
03:44 - time it goes to X axes of 206 which is
03:48 - kind of on the left-hand side and and
03:51 - then pick a random Y coordinates between
03:55 - 120 and - 120 - caustic 120 which is
04:00 - basically the whole vertical axis of the
04:07 - screen and you want to repeat this until
04:11 - either you touch the edge of the screen
04:16 - or touch the monkey
04:21 - and so every like until you touch the
04:25 - edge of the monkey you want to keep on
04:27 - changing the x-coordinate of Apple buys
04:32 - to me and that is meaning that okay we
04:36 - want the Apple to move to the right hand
04:39 - side three units of x-coordinate each
04:43 - step and every time we touch the monkey
04:49 - we will change this quarter by five and
04:54 - we could actually change this into maybe
04:58 - the Apple is four powerful than orange
05:01 - then we can just change it okay let's
05:03 - make it like 10 and then maybe because
05:07 - it's more powerful we will make it
05:09 - harder to catch and which means that we
05:13 - want the x-axis to actually change
05:16 - faster so a little bit faster speed so
05:21 - you might wonder okay well now that I
05:24 - have added the Apple there why is it not
05:28 - changing well that's because there's no
05:31 - offense block yet right so we need an
05:34 - event block to update the apples to
05:40 - trigger the Apple to move so this time
05:43 - remember our goal was to trigger our
05:47 - Apple to move whenever we have whenever
05:52 - we have press the spacebar and so I have
05:56 - gone into the events block and chose
05:59 - this block called space key press and
06:06 - that's it so we just need to snap that
06:11 - into the forever block you'll hear a
06:14 - snapping sound normally and let's see
06:18 - how that goes
06:20 - so I'm gonna start the game I'll stop
06:22 - the game first and press
06:30 - this and let me press now the spacebar
06:36 - okay seems like I'm this is working
06:44 - pretty well it's moving faster for sure
06:46 - faster than the orange and also faster
06:52 - than the virus and let's see if my score
06:56 - is going up the way I wanted okay yeah I
06:59 - went from 104 to I won four and looks
07:05 - pretty good and the only thing that I
07:08 - would not like I feel like we could
07:11 - change this is let's go back to here
07:13 - right so do you see this that like the
07:16 - when I stop the game and restart it the
07:19 - Apple is just here and it's kind of like
07:24 - not moving until I press the spacebar
07:27 - but then if I don't press the spacebar
07:32 - ever the Apple is just lingering here
07:35 - and it doesn't make a lot of sense so
07:38 - what we can do is to first make the
07:44 - Apple invisible by pressing here so if
07:48 - you see here I would just choose this
07:52 - the invisible sign and so nicely that
07:57 - the Apple is disappearing whenever we
08:00 - start the game that at least there is no
08:02 - Apple and it's kind of like the secret
08:04 - weapon that we can call out with a space
08:08 - bar key and so now is press a space well
08:15 - now that I press the space key I need
08:17 - some way to ask the Apple to show up so
08:21 - luckily scratch has made it really easy
08:24 - for us and all we need to do is to click
08:27 - into the looks drawer and choose the
08:32 - show block so here is we're programming
08:38 - the Apple sprite that whenever we press
08:42 - the spacebar we
08:43 - wanted to show we want the Apple to show
08:47 - up there we go so I press the spacebar
08:50 - and right away the app will show up yep
08:57 - so this is a much better implementation
09:00 - of the game that we are able to first
09:06 - hide the Apple and then only if we press
09:10 - the spacebar this Apple will show up but
09:16 - the only thing that you can see here is
09:18 - that now that I've played the game once
09:21 - because the Apple has shown up on the
09:25 - screen it's not disappearing even if I
09:29 - remove even if I press the red stop
09:34 - button and if I press the green flag
09:37 - again it again is stuck there so it's
09:40 - not great and what we need to do is to
09:44 - add an additional block to ask the game
09:51 - to every time we start the game the
09:54 - Apple needs to hide itself so how we
09:59 - will do it is to go inside our defense
10:05 - block and again find our green flag
10:08 - block and this time we don't want to use
10:16 - the show block but we want to use the
10:19 - hide block so the hide block is
10:22 - basically the opposite of show and it
10:25 - basically tell scratch that we are going
10:29 - to hide our Apple every time we start
10:32 - the game and only if I press the space
10:36 - key that the Apple would show up and
10:40 - let's see if that works okay so now I
10:42 - have to stop the game I've stopped the
10:45 - game and I am pressing the bread
10:49 - pressing the green flag and there we go
10:53 - so the Apple is nicely hidden
10:57 - now I just have this simple game with
10:58 - our orange and virus just looks really
11:03 - nice and clean and all we need to do is
11:08 - to then now press the spacebar and boom
11:15 - our Apple is now showing up and moving
11:19 - along nicely
11:22 - and I'm gonna pause this video like this
11:26 - stop this game and test it again and see
11:30 - if I press the green flag does the Apple
11:34 - disappear again okay so the answer is
11:39 - yes would have successfully implemented
11:41 - this project level 2 so this game is
11:47 - where we're implementing the version 2
11:49 - of this game so just to recap what we
11:52 - did was starting with this simple
11:57 - project of the orange and the virus and
12:02 - now we wanted to add an apple to our
12:07 - game that only appear if we press the
12:11 - green before I press the spacebar key
12:14 - and the beauty of this is that we have
12:19 - duplicated the blocks from the orange
12:24 - orange sprite and drag that into the
12:28 - apples rights and the only thing that
12:31 - has changed from the orange and the
12:34 - apple sprite is the offense Bob is
12:38 - changed from the green flag to play King
12:43 - to the spacebar pressing so here is the
12:48 - main difference and we quickly also
12:51 - realize that the Apple has been around
12:54 - for the entire time and even if we stop
12:57 - the project if we stop the game and we
13:00 - haven't press the space key yet it's
13:03 - still keep on showing up and that's not
13:05 - great so we decided to first
13:10 - make our Apple disappear here so it's by
13:14 - default invisible and every time we
13:21 - press the space key we will ask the
13:25 - Apple to show up using the looks block
13:29 - here and afterwards we also realized
13:36 - that after the States after the Apple
13:39 - show up it doesn't disappear with our
13:43 - game stopping
13:44 - so we then finally added this final
13:48 - block to ask the Apple to hide itself
13:54 - every time we start the game and we use
13:58 - we did that by the by using the offense
14:01 - block of green black dot click and also
14:06 - using the looks block of hiding the
14:10 - Apple that we did today is a version
14:16 - number two of our eat the vitamins
14:18 - project and we added our Apple and
14:21 - learned how to use the event block to
14:24 - help us control the appearance and
14:28 - disappearance of the Apple

Cleaned transcript:

so if you guys remember last few sessions we did this project that is related to the coronavirus situation as well that we want ourselves to eat more vitamin which is orange and dodge away from the virus and each time the monkey eats the orange we gain some points and then each time the virus hit the monkey you see so yeah we lose one score and if you guys like on my project you would be able to see the remix button as well and because this is already my project I don't see the remix button there and what I'll do is to go inside and I want to make some adjustment to this project and so I think the adjustment that I'm gonna make is to simply have an additional source of vitamin such that my monkey could be healthier and let's do that so let's say this additional feature of our game is whenever we press the spacebar an apple would appear on the screen so just so just now what I did perfectly was click on choose the sprites at the bottom right corner and this will pop up and yeah basically I am choosing the Apple it could be a banana or other things as well so so yeah you can see the sprite is here and what we want to do is to simply go back to the orange so remember the orange is already kind of doing what we want the apple to do which is to move from the left side of the screen all the way to the right hand side and after they after it hits the edge of the wall off the screen it will come back to the left side and then go all the way again and every time the orange hit the monkey the score goes up by five so it's pretty much what we want except that this time we're not asking the Apple to change to start moving with space but we want the Apple to start moving closer so we want we don't want the Apple to start moving with a green flag but we want the Apple to start moving with the same Sparky so what we want to do just now I quickly did was to click a duplicate function and I'm going to drop that into Apple okay so the duplicate function is slightly problematic sometimes but just have to do it a few times yeah you can see that here also kind of like has to duplicate it here so now that I have this one you can see that this is a forever block and has the Apple every time it goes to X axes of 206 which is kind of on the lefthand side and and then pick a random Y coordinates between 120 and 120 caustic 120 which is basically the whole vertical axis of the screen and you want to repeat this until either you touch the edge of the screen or touch the monkey and so every like until you touch the edge of the monkey you want to keep on changing the xcoordinate of Apple buys to me and that is meaning that okay we want the Apple to move to the right hand side three units of xcoordinate each step and every time we touch the monkey we will change this quarter by five and we could actually change this into maybe the Apple is four powerful than orange then we can just change it okay let's make it like 10 and then maybe because it's more powerful we will make it harder to catch and which means that we want the xaxis to actually change faster so a little bit faster speed so you might wonder okay well now that I have added the Apple there why is it not changing well that's because there's no offense block yet right so we need an event block to update the apples to trigger the Apple to move so this time remember our goal was to
