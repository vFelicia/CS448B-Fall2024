00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share beginner friendly
00:03 - tutorials on scratch
00:05 - minecraft roblox and many more today
00:08 - we're going to be learning how to make a
00:10 - dragon boat the
00:11 - maze on scratch so let's get started
00:15 - all right so let's take a look at this
00:16 - project in this project we'll be
00:19 - creating a maze with four levels so you
00:21 - can play around and scratch with your
00:23 - character which is going to be our
00:24 - dragon over here
00:25 - so as you can see i'm moving around
00:29 - with my keyboard and as i reach the
00:32 - end another level comes up
00:35 - so let's go ahead and get started with
00:37 - this project
00:38 - so we'll start by creating an empty
00:40 - project on scratch
00:46 - all right so next what we're going to do
00:48 - is we're going to import
00:49 - the sprites that we need for our project
00:52 - so we're going to use a dragon face
00:54 - and a zhongsu so there is
00:57 - a link in the description below where
00:59 - you can download those images
01:01 - you can also go ahead and search if you
01:02 - want to use your own images
01:04 - online for a png of those images
01:07 - so i'm just going to go ahead and upload
01:09 - those sprites in
01:12 - so now that we have both of these
01:15 - sprites
01:16 - we're going to now make another spray
01:19 - i'm going to use my paint tool because
01:21 - we're going to be making the maze walls
01:25 - and we're going to use a rectangle too
01:28 - to start making our
01:29 - walls that we want for our maze
01:33 - so you can make your outline thicker and
01:36 - your background
01:36 - your fill color can be anything inside
01:39 - i'm going to let it be purple
01:41 - but you can choose to be any color that
01:43 - you want
01:45 - and then let's say
01:50 - i'm going to make it like this
01:55 - and then you can copy paste it
02:03 - so this is going to be
02:06 - my first level here
02:11 - and then i'm just going to rename it as
02:13 - level 1.
02:16 - now just so you know
02:19 - is like a traditional food that people
02:21 - eat during a dragon boat festival
02:23 - and they're like delicious rice balls
02:26 - that are covered in bamboo leaves
02:28 - they have meat peanuts and other
02:30 - ingredients inside of them
02:31 - i'm pretty sure you might have eaten
02:34 - them sometime in your life
02:35 - or even heard of them um
02:38 - again you can use any other image for
02:40 - the angle so we're going to make the
02:42 - tone to
02:42 - our goal where the dragon gets the and
02:45 - we switch to another
02:47 - level so let's first start
02:50 - by coding in our dragon face so that
02:53 - our dragon is moving so let's code our
02:56 - when clicked
02:59 - and we want it to be forever so we're
03:01 - gonna put a forever
03:05 - and we're going to put that if then
03:08 - condition saying that if
03:12 - right arrow is pressed so i'm going to
03:14 - find
03:15 - key pressed
03:20 - we want the change x by
03:23 - 10. so what this basically is going to
03:25 - do is
03:27 - whenever the right error is pressed
03:30 - move it to the right
03:34 - it's more fluid because you don't have
03:35 - to keep pressing on it it's gonna
03:37 - continue to do that forever now
03:40 - we want to do that for all of our keys
03:42 - so the left arrow the
03:44 - up arrow and the down arrow so what i'm
03:45 - going to basically do is just copy paste
03:48 - this and just change the values so i'm
03:50 - going to make this
03:52 - left arrow change x by
03:55 - minus 10 again right click
03:58 - duplicate
04:02 - make this up arrow and then
04:07 - since now we're going up and down to
04:09 - change y
04:11 - then duplicate
04:14 - and then change this to minus 10. so
04:17 - again we have
04:18 - change x for left and right and change y
04:20 - for up and down
04:22 - so now i can move up
04:25 - down left right
04:30 - and it works okay
04:33 - so next what we're gonna do is you want
04:36 - it to be sensing those walls around so
04:38 - that whenever we touch the walls
04:40 - that our dragon goes back to the
04:42 - beginning because we don't want
04:43 - the dragon to be touching those walls so
04:46 - we're gonna be making use of
04:48 - the sensing blocks again
04:51 - and we want to do first of all we want
04:53 - to create a starting point for our
04:55 - dragon
04:56 - so we're going to get our when clicked
05:02 - and we want to get first of all i'm
05:04 - going to place my dragon face up here
05:07 - and get a go to
05:12 - and we want it to be forever
05:15 - saying that if
05:18 - it touches this purple color so to get
05:22 - that color we're to get this touching
05:23 - color
05:24 - block first click on this color click on
05:27 - this eyedropper icon over here
05:32 - and click this purple color
05:35 - and you should get that color over here
05:37 - and again we're just going to place the
05:39 - go to
05:42 - block
05:46 - all right great now we also want
05:49 - it to switch to another level when
05:53 - we touch the zhongsu so we're going to
05:56 - get another
05:56 - if condition over here
06:03 - and saying that if it touches the
06:05 - tsungsu
06:10 - then we want to broadcast next level
06:22 - all right now we have this broadcasting
06:25 - now all we have to do is basically start
06:27 - to create those next
06:29 - levels so to do that what we're going to
06:31 - do is go back to our
06:33 - level sprite over here and in costumes
06:37 - we're just going to duplicate these
06:39 - levels
06:41 - and switch them around
06:44 - so oh we've got the spelling of level
06:47 - along let me just
06:48 - change that
06:52 - right great so again you can modify
06:55 - this level however you want let's say i
06:57 - want level two
06:59 - to be like this you can add
07:02 - more obstacles or anything
07:06 - so this is my level
07:11 - two
07:15 - and then again you want to duplicate it
07:17 - so this is level three so we're gonna
07:19 - make it level
07:20 - until level four you can make it however
07:22 - how many as you want
07:26 - um we'll just modify this a little bit
07:28 - to this side
07:30 - make it a little bit different
07:43 - all right and then
07:47 - another one which is just gonna be
07:52 - let's say this one is the most difficult
07:54 - one we're gonna make
08:10 - make sure when you make it it the it's
08:13 - not
08:13 - the gap is not too small so that the
08:15 - dragon face cannot go
08:17 - through so keep that in mind as well
08:19 - when you're designing your maze levels
08:32 - all right so i think i'm happy with my
08:34 - levels we have level one
08:36 - two three and four now
08:40 - all we're gonna do is we're gonna go
08:42 - back
08:43 - to our dragon
08:46 - and we're just gonna put it when i
08:50 - receive
08:50 - over there so when i receive
08:54 - next level we want it to go back to this
08:57 - position
09:00 - go to
09:04 - and there you have it so we have all the
09:06 - code
09:07 - done now let's go ahead and test the
09:10 - project
09:11 - so i'm going to move around
09:18 - and as you can see
09:24 - we forgot to do one more thing which is
09:26 - switch the costume
09:27 - of our levels so to do that
09:31 - we need to go back to our sprite and
09:34 - we're going to put a when clicked over
09:36 - here
09:39 - and actually you're gonna click when i
09:41 - receive next level
09:44 - and we're gonna just go to next costume
09:47 - so whenever the next level is
09:49 - broadcasted
09:50 - it's going to come over here and it's
09:52 - going to switch to the next costume
09:55 - let's go and try that now
09:59 - and as you can see we have now switched
10:01 - to another level there
10:06 - great and if you crash onto these walls
10:09 - you will go back to the starting point
10:12 - so that's all for this project
10:14 - let's let me just zoom in on this the
10:18 - codes once again so that you can take a
10:19 - look on what we have
10:22 - so we have the if conditions for up down
10:25 - left right
10:27 - to move our dragon face then we have if
10:30 - condition the
10:30 - testing to see that whenever we touch
10:33 - these walls
10:34 - we go back to the starting place or when
10:36 - we touch the zones
10:37 - we will go to the next level well where
10:40 - it will broadcast the next level
10:43 - and then in the level sprite itself
10:46 - whenever it receives that next level
10:48 - broadcast message
10:49 - it will switch to the next level so
10:51 - that's all for today
