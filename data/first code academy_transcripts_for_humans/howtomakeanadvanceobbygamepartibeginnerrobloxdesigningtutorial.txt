00:01 - hello everyone
00:03 - welcome back to our channel here we
00:05 - share beginner friendly coding tutorials
00:07 - on scratch
00:08 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:11 - many more
00:12 - today i will be teaching you on how to
00:14 - create an
00:15 - advanced roblox of the game
00:19 - this advanced roblox of the game
00:21 - tutorial is divided into four parts
00:24 - in this video which is the first part of
00:26 - the series
00:28 - i will be teaching you on how to create
00:30 - simple
00:31 - and common obstacles which you can find
00:34 - in most of the games
00:36 - which includes a conveyor belt explosive
00:39 - laces
00:41 - sliding in obstacles which you can
00:43 - create
00:44 - using roblox studio so let's get started
00:50 - all right so the first thing i'm going
00:51 - to do is i'm going to open up my roblox
00:54 - studio
00:54 - and create a new file with the template
00:57 - of a classic
00:58 - faceplate
01:04 - alright now i have loaded my baseplate
01:06 - so this is where i'm going to create my
01:08 - roblox i'll
01:09 - begin so first i'm going to start off at
01:13 - one corner of my base plate
01:15 - which gives me the option of using the
01:18 - whole base plate
01:19 - to make my advance or begin
01:23 - so i'll just move my camera wave up
01:28 - all right so i'll be going to this
01:30 - corner of my base plate so if i can see
01:32 - here
01:34 - this is my whole base plate
01:41 - and i'm going to start off with
01:44 - the right bottom corner here
01:52 - all right so i'm going to just add a
01:55 - spawn location
01:56 - first so that my
02:00 - player would spawn at the beginning of
02:02 - my up
02:03 - i'll be course so i'm going to click on
02:06 - toolbox
02:07 - and i'm going to find a spawn location
02:13 - so you can choose any spawn location
02:15 - that you like
02:17 - i'll just add one there
02:22 - i need to drag it to the corner here
02:33 - a little bit like that all right so what
02:36 - i'm going to do next is
02:37 - on the first part of my upbeat course
02:39 - i'll be just
02:40 - picking some simple platforms where the
02:43 - player have to jump around
02:45 - so for to do that i'll just click on
02:48 - part use a block
02:52 - and i'll be choosing the size of
02:56 - the width and the length of the
02:59 - platform is going to be eight into eight
03:02 - so on the properties i'm going to change
03:05 - into 8
03:06 - comma 1 comma 8.
03:12 - so it gives me a platform that is
03:15 - big enough for me to jump into
03:18 - so i'll just write you scale
03:23 - so use move and i'll be dragging this
03:28 - and place it four starts away from my
03:32 - spawn location
03:35 - like that so you you're feel free to
03:38 - change your color
03:39 - and the material of your object so i'll
03:42 - just
03:43 - click on the material to be
03:46 - plastic and i'll just
03:49 - change the color to be
03:57 - all right so next what i'm going to do
03:59 - is
04:00 - i'm going to anchor it so that when at
04:03 - the end of my game
04:05 - once i design my game i'll be deleting
04:09 - the base bit so
04:10 - i need to anchor the platform so that
04:13 - they don't fall off
04:15 - so i have anchored them so next i'm
04:18 - going to create
04:19 - or duplicate this platform three times
04:23 - so that there will be three jumping
04:25 - platforms
04:27 - just add one more that is four
04:31 - studs away apart from each other
04:47 - all right
04:51 - that should be it so it looks nice i'll
04:54 - be
04:54 - changing the colors
05:05 - all right next what i'm going to do is
05:07 - i'm going to create some
05:09 - wedge platforms to make it more
05:12 - interesting
05:12 - so what i'm going to do is i'll be
05:14 - adding
05:16 - a wedge platform
05:19 - and if you can see the wedge
05:23 - the top part of the bridge is on
05:27 - that is facing towards my platform so i
05:30 - need to
05:30 - rotate it or flip it horizontally
05:33 - let's just click on rotate and
05:37 - you see a green color circle so i'll be
05:40 - turning my wedge part along that
05:47 - so that the corner of the edge would be
05:50 - facing the other way like
05:53 - where you can jump onto the other
05:55 - platform
05:58 - so i'll just make this wedge to be a
06:01 - little bit bigger
06:03 - so i'm going to click on scale
06:08 - make it the length of the weight
06:11 - which bar to be longer and also the
06:18 - height
06:20 - all right so next i'm going to add
06:22 - another wedge platform
06:24 - and it will be four which platforms that
06:27 - would be floating in the media so it's
06:28 - kind of like
06:29 - making a staircase so i'll be adding a
06:33 - wedge platform
06:35 - like that and i'll be turning it
06:40 - like that so i'll just change the color
06:44 - it should be brown
06:49 - so and then i'll just make it to be a
06:52 - little bit bigger
06:53 - so click on scale
06:58 - begin high
07:02 - like that and i'll be just moving it
07:06 - up so i'm going to click on move
07:11 - and click on the green arrow and i'm
07:14 - going to lift it up like that
07:17 - so that it's floating in the middle
07:21 - so i'll just bring it a little bit
07:23 - closer so that it's not too far for me
07:25 - to
07:26 - jump into
07:45 - and then i'm going to anchor this
07:48 - platform so that it doesn't fall down
07:51 - when i
07:52 - try to play my game because right now
07:54 - it's floating on the midi
07:56 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
07:58 - make four more
07:59 - three more steps actually that is
08:01 - floating on the media and kind of
08:04 - giving like a staircase effect so that
08:06 - the player can
08:07 - jump so i'll just
08:11 - duplicate it so you can press on command
08:13 - we
08:14 - command c and command v if you're using
08:16 - a mac computer
08:18 - or if you're using a windows computer or
08:21 - a laptop you can use
08:23 - ctrl c and then press on control v to
08:26 - duplicate
08:36 - and maybe lift it up a little bit
08:41 - and then anchor as you should
08:44 - so i'll just change the color
08:49 - so again i'll just duplicate it okay
09:14 - so you can always try this out to see if
09:17 - the spacing
09:18 - is fine for the player to jump around
09:23 - so after i my player passes along
09:26 - this particular section of the course
09:31 - the player is going to reach the first
09:34 - checkpoint
09:35 - so whenever the player dies during the
09:38 - course maybe whether it's full maybe
09:41 - whether it
09:42 - gets out of the uh upbeat game platform
09:45 - or maybe
09:47 - it touches a laser or an explosive laser
09:50 - the player would always point to the
09:52 - last
09:53 - updated checkpoint so i'll be adding
09:56 - another small location
09:58 - after this wedge part
10:12 - all right and i'll just make it anchor
10:15 - so that
10:16 - okay it's already anchored so make sure
10:18 - that all the parts are anchored so that
10:21 - we don't have any platforms that are
10:22 - falling down
10:24 - when you play the game all right so next
10:27 - we are going to make the second obstacle
10:29 - which would be
10:30 - a tunnel of explosive layer
10:33 - now in this channel you would have a
10:35 - conveyor belt and then you have to jump
10:37 - along
10:38 - when you see an explosive layer but if
10:40 - you touch an explosive layer you'll be
10:42 - dead so first i'll be creating my
10:46 - channel so i'll be using
10:49 - another part
10:53 - and i'll just change the color it to be
10:58 - black
11:02 - all right and i'll just
11:06 - make my ground off the base of my
11:09 - channel
11:11 - so i'll just use scale drag it along
11:16 - make the length of it
11:19 - to be a little bit wider so that the
11:22 - player can pass along
11:25 - and then long enough so you can increase
11:28 - the length of it
11:30 - the width should be just enough for the
11:33 - player to pass along
11:41 - okay so in this tunnel you'll be not
11:43 - only having laser
11:45 - flashing laces but there'll be like
11:47 - other obstacles that is
11:49 - popping up like walls with obstacles
11:53 - that is coming sliding in
11:54 - and sliding up so this space is going to
11:58 - be
11:59 - having both of the explosive laces and
12:01 - the obstacles that are sliding in
12:05 - so i'll just make it long enough so that
12:08 - it's going to contain both of these
12:10 - obstacles
12:12 - so it's going to be like this big just
12:15 - long yeah
12:17 - all right next i need to
12:20 - bring it up so that it matches to the
12:22 - height of this phone location so like
12:25 - it's kind of like
12:26 - leveled up
12:33 - okay so i have a really long
12:37 - space for my channel
12:40 - okay next i'm going to add my conveyor
12:42 - pass so i need another
12:44 - part that is on the ground that is going
12:46 - to be act acting
12:48 - as my conveyor so i'll just add another
12:52 - part but i'll just change the color for
12:56 - now
12:56 - so that it's it's easy to identify so
13:00 - i'll just
13:00 - make it to a lighter color like that
13:04 - and i'm going to rename this part which
13:07 - i just add
13:08 - as convey so that it's easy for me to
13:11 - add my code when i do the coding
13:15 - so i can identify my path easily
13:18 - conveyor
13:20 - all right so the conveyor is going to be
13:24 - the width of the convey is going to be
13:26 - the same as this
13:28 - a little bit smaller because i need some
13:31 - spacing
13:32 - in the two edges so that it's
13:35 - good so i can uh build my wall
13:39 - so i just add that
13:42 - and use scale and stretch it
13:46 - in terms of length and i'm going to stop
13:50 - it
13:51 - here and then i'll just
13:55 - increase the width like this
13:58 - and wait like that
14:06 - all right so i have my current way right
14:08 - now
14:09 - all right now i'm going to create my
14:10 - walls on the
14:12 - sides of my panel so i'll just add
14:16 - another part
14:20 - and this is going to be the same color
14:22 - as my base of my
14:24 - channel so if you want to change the
14:26 - color how make it a colorful tunnel
14:28 - just feel free to do so so just stretch
14:31 - it along
14:42 - and then i'm going to lift it up so that
14:45 - the height of this part is up
14:59 - all right i have one more right now and
15:02 - i'll just
15:04 - duplicate it again and i'll just fix it
15:07 - on the other side of my
15:10 - turn so i have two walls right now
15:13 - now you might see there's a spacing of
15:15 - my conveyor so
15:17 - again we can fix that so i'll be
15:20 - clicking on the
15:21 - conveyor part and click on the red knobs
15:24 - and then stretch it out so that there's
15:27 - no spacing
15:30 - of the base plate all right so i'll be
15:33 - adding my
15:34 - cylinders right now or my laser beams
15:37 - so i'll just go inside my laser beams
15:41 - like
15:41 - inside my tunnel and i'll be choosing
15:46 - a cylinder this time that would be
15:49 - acting as my laser beam
15:51 - so i'll just change the material to be
15:53 - neon and
15:55 - i'll change my list the color of my
15:57 - laser beams to be red
16:01 - alright and then i'm going to click on
16:04 - scale
16:05 - and choose the knobs and stretch it
16:09 - along this way
16:14 - like that and i'll just lift it
16:17 - a little bit not so that it's not
16:20 - directly on the conveyor belt
16:22 - like that
16:28 - so you can see there's some spacing
16:30 - between the lysophil
16:32 - and the base of the conveyor belt okay
16:35 - so the reason
16:36 - why i didn't place my laser beam in the
16:39 - very beginning of the conveyor belt is
16:42 - that
16:42 - due to the speed of the conveyor belt
16:45 - like when the player
16:46 - jumps onto the conveyor belt and if
16:48 - there's a laser beam
16:50 - directly in front of us the player would
16:53 - instantly get killed so we are going to
16:54 - give some spacing
16:57 - so that the player can get ready to
17:00 - jump over the laser beams so i'll just
17:04 - move it a little bit further like that
17:08 - all right so since my convey is not too
17:11 - long
17:11 - i'm not going to add a lot of laser
17:13 - beams but
17:15 - if you want you can you feel free to add
17:17 - more beams
17:18 - so i'll just add another beam
17:30 - okay so that's the first
17:33 - obstacle inside the tunnel next i'm
17:37 - going to add my platforms that are
17:39 - sliding in and out
17:41 - all right so to do that i'll be adding
17:45 - one block out
17:49 - of the tunnel so i'll be adding a
17:53 - block here
17:56 - and then which is going to slide in
18:00 - this way and another block that is going
18:02 - to
18:03 - slide in this way
18:08 - all right so i'll just add i'll just
18:10 - change my camera view so that i can see
18:15 - one side of my conveyor belt so make
18:19 - sure that you know where your
18:21 - conveyor ends and then it starts to the
18:24 - next
18:25 - obstacle in the tunnel so just somewhere
18:29 - here would be fine
18:30 - so i'll just click on q
18:33 - and go down and then change my camera
18:36 - view
18:38 - alright and then i'm going to click on
18:42 - a block another block and i'll just
18:45 - change
18:45 - the material back to plastic
18:48 - now this time i'm going to scale it to
18:51 - the size
18:53 - to a height of the wall
18:56 - i'm going to click on the green knob and
18:58 - stretch it along
19:01 - like that so that it's
19:04 - directly the same size as the height of
19:08 - the wall
19:09 - so make sure that there's no sticking
19:11 - out
19:13 - all right and
19:17 - yeah so there's there should not be any
19:19 - sticking out like that
19:22 - you can put it out like that
19:26 - and then you you can stretch it out on
19:29 - the
19:30 - outer side of the wall that's fine but
19:33 - there should not be anything that is
19:34 - sticking
19:35 - inside the wall or into the inner part
19:38 - of the tunnel
19:40 - so i'll just make it a little bit bigger
19:42 - so that it's a very
19:45 - big obstacle that is sliding in and out
19:49 - into the time so i'll just bring this
19:53 - block in front
19:57 - like that all right now i'll be changing
20:01 - this
20:02 - or renaming this part as moving part so
20:05 - that
20:06 - i need to code it so that it keeps on
20:08 - going to the left
20:09 - and another part is going to the right
20:14 - so i'll just go to view click on
20:16 - properties
20:18 - oh click on explorer so make sure that
20:21 - you have
20:21 - highlighted or clicked on this
20:24 - particular part
20:25 - and i'm going to rename it as
20:30 - moving obstacle
20:38 - all right so i'll just place copy
20:41 - and duplicate it
20:49 - all right so now i'm going to place one
20:52 - more
20:54 - obstacle that is sliding on the from the
20:57 - other side of
20:58 - the tunnel so just copy again
21:03 - and move it
21:06 - this part so that it's in between these
21:09 - two blocks
21:11 - and move it down so that it
21:14 - gets attached to the wall so remove your
21:17 - camera
21:19 - and see if it is getting
21:22 - closer to the wall
21:26 - and then push it down
21:31 - zoom in and see if there's anything
21:34 - sticking out
21:45 - all right
21:49 - okay so i'll just move it a little bit
21:52 - i'll just move this part a little bit
21:56 - here
22:00 - and i'll just duplicate this part
22:04 - and go to the corner so
22:07 - that means i have four moving parts or
22:10 - moving obstacles
22:15 - push it down
22:21 - okay so that should be it
22:28 - all right so now we have made the tunnel
22:33 - and next we are going to make the other
22:35 - obstacles
22:37 - so that's all for today so in the next
22:39 - tutorial we will learn how to
22:42 - code the obstacles for lasers the
22:45 - conveyor belt and the sliding
22:47 - platforms and also we'll be learning
22:51 - on how to make different types of
22:53 - obstacles which we can use for your
22:55 - object

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today i will be teaching you on how to create an advanced roblox of the game this advanced roblox of the game tutorial is divided into four parts in this video which is the first part of the series i will be teaching you on how to create simple and common obstacles which you can find in most of the games which includes a conveyor belt explosive laces sliding in obstacles which you can create using roblox studio so let's get started all right so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to open up my roblox studio and create a new file with the template of a classic faceplate alright now i have loaded my baseplate so this is where i'm going to create my roblox i'll begin so first i'm going to start off at one corner of my base plate which gives me the option of using the whole base plate to make my advance or begin so i'll just move my camera wave up all right so i'll be going to this corner of my base plate so if i can see here this is my whole base plate and i'm going to start off with the right bottom corner here all right so i'm going to just add a spawn location first so that my player would spawn at the beginning of my up i'll be course so i'm going to click on toolbox and i'm going to find a spawn location so you can choose any spawn location that you like i'll just add one there i need to drag it to the corner here a little bit like that all right so what i'm going to do next is on the first part of my upbeat course i'll be just picking some simple platforms where the player have to jump around so for to do that i'll just click on part use a block and i'll be choosing the size of the width and the length of the platform is going to be eight into eight so on the properties i'm going to change into 8 comma 1 comma 8. so it gives me a platform that is big enough for me to jump into so i'll just write you scale so use move and i'll be dragging this and place it four starts away from my spawn location like that so you you're feel free to change your color and the material of your object so i'll just click on the material to be plastic and i'll just change the color to be all right so next what i'm going to do is i'm going to anchor it so that when at the end of my game once i design my game i'll be deleting the base bit so i need to anchor the platform so that they don't fall off so i have anchored them so next i'm going to create or duplicate this platform three times so that there will be three jumping platforms just add one more that is four studs away apart from each other all right that should be it so it looks nice i'll be changing the colors all right next what i'm going to do is i'm going to create some wedge platforms to make it more interesting so what i'm going to do is i'll be adding a wedge platform and if you can see the wedge the top part of the bridge is on that is facing towards my platform so i need to rotate it or flip it horizontally let's just click on rotate and you see a green color circle so i'll be turning my wedge part along that so that the corner of the edge would be facing the other way like where you can jump onto the other platform so i'll just make this wedge to be a little bit bigger so i'm going to click on scale make it the length of the weight which bar to be longer and also the height all right so next i'm going to add another wedge platform and it will be four which platforms that would be floating in the media so it's kind of like making a staircase so i'll be adding a wedge platform like that and i'll be turning it like that so i'll just change the color it should be brown so and then i'll just make it to be a little bit bigger so click on scale begin high like that and i'll be just moving it up so i'm going to click on move and click on the green arrow and i'm going to lift it up like that so that it's floating in the middle so i'll just bring it a little bit closer so that it's not too far for me to jump into and then i'm going to anchor this platform so that it doesn't fall down when i try to play my game because right now it's floating on the midi so what i'm going to do is i'm going to make four more three more steps actually that is floating on the media and kind of giving like a staircase effect so that the player can jump so i'll just duplicate it so you can press on command we command c and command v if you're using a mac computer or if you're using a windows computer or a laptop you can use ctrl c and then press on control v to duplicate and maybe lift it up a little bit and then anchor as you should so i'll just change the color so again i'll just duplicate it okay so you can always try this out to see if the spacing is fine for the player to jump around so after i my player passes along this particular section of the course the player is going to reach the first checkpoint so whenever the player dies during the course maybe whether it's full maybe whether it gets out of the uh upbeat game platform or maybe it touches a laser or an explosive laser the player would always point to the last updated checkpoint so i'll be adding another small location after this wedge part all right and i'll just make it anchor so that okay it's already anchored so make sure that all the parts are anchored so that we don't have any platforms that are falling down when you play the game all right so next we are going to make the second obstacle which would be a tunnel of explosive layer now in this channel you would have a conveyor belt and then you have to jump along when you see an explosive layer but if you touch an explosive layer you'll be dead so first i'll be creating my channel so i'll be using another part and i'll just change the color it to be black all right and i'll just make my ground off the base of my channel so i'll just use scale drag it along make the length of it to be a little bit wider so that the player can pass along and then long enough so you can increase the length of it the width should be just enough for the player to pass along okay so in this tunnel you'll be not only having laser flashing laces but there'll be like other obstacles that is popping up like walls with obstacles that is coming sliding in and sliding up so this space is going to be having both of the explosive laces and the obstacles that are sliding in so i'll just make it long enough so that it's going to contain both of these obstacles so it's going to be like this big just long yeah all right next i need to bring it up so that it matches to the height of this phone location so like it's kind of like leveled up okay so i have a really long space for my channel okay next i'm going to add my conveyor pass so i need another part that is on the ground that is going to be act acting as my conveyor so i'll just add another part but i'll just change the color for now so that it's it's easy to identify so i'll just make it to a lighter color like that and i'm going to rename this part which i just add as convey so that it's easy for me to add my code when i do the coding so i can identify my path easily conveyor all right so the conveyor is going to be the width of the convey is going to be the same as this a little bit smaller because i need some spacing in the two edges so that it's good so i can uh build my wall so i just add that and use scale and stretch it in terms of length and i'm going to stop it here and then i'll just increase the width like this and wait like that all right so i have my current way right now all right now i'm going to create my walls on the sides of my panel so i'll just add another part and this is going to be the same color as my base of my channel so if you want to change the color how make it a colorful tunnel just feel free to do so so just stretch it along and then i'm going to lift it up so that the height of this part is up all right i have one more right now and i'll just duplicate it again and i'll just fix it on the other side of my turn so i have two walls right now now you might see there's a spacing of my conveyor so again we can fix that so i'll be clicking on the conveyor part and click on the red knobs and then stretch it out so that there's no spacing of the base plate all right so i'll be adding my cylinders right now or my laser beams so i'll just go inside my laser beams like inside my tunnel and i'll be choosing a cylinder this time that would be acting as my laser beam so i'll just change the material to be neon and i'll change my list the color of my laser beams to be red alright and then i'm going to click on scale and choose the knobs and stretch it along this way like that and i'll just lift it a little bit not so that it's not directly on the conveyor belt like that so you can see there's some spacing between the lysophil and the base of the conveyor belt okay so the reason why i didn't place my laser beam in the very beginning of the conveyor belt is that due to the speed of the conveyor belt like when the player jumps onto the conveyor belt and if there's a laser beam directly in front of us the player would instantly get killed so we are going to give some spacing so that the player can get ready to jump over the laser beams so i'll just move it a little bit further like that all right so since my convey is not too long i'm not going to add a lot of laser beams but if you want you can you feel free to add more beams so i'll just add another beam okay so that's the first obstacle inside the tunnel next i'm going to add my platforms that are sliding in and out all right so to do that i'll be adding one block out of the tunnel so i'll be adding a block here and then which is going to slide in this way and another block that is going to slide in this way all right so i'll just add i'll just change my camera view so that i can see one side of my conveyor belt so make sure that you know where your conveyor ends and then it starts to the next obstacle in the tunnel so just somewhere here would be fine so i'll just click on q and go down and then change my camera view alright and then i'm going to click on a block another block and i'll just change the material back to plastic now this time i'm going to scale it to the size to a height of the wall i'm going to click on the green knob and stretch it along like that so that it's directly the same size as the height of the wall so make sure that there's no sticking out all right and yeah so there's there should not be any sticking out like that you can put it out like that and then you you can stretch it out on the outer side of the wall that's fine but there should not be anything that is sticking inside the wall or into the inner part of the tunnel so i'll just make it a little bit bigger so that it's a very big obstacle that is sliding in and out into the time so i'll just bring this block in front like that all right now i'll be changing this or renaming this part as moving part so that i need to code it so that it keeps on going to the left and another part is going to the right so i'll just go to view click on properties oh click on explorer so make sure that you have highlighted or clicked on this particular part and i'm going to rename it as moving obstacle all right so i'll just place copy and duplicate it all right so now i'm going to place one more obstacle that is sliding on the from the other side of the tunnel so just copy again and move it this part so that it's in between these two blocks and move it down so that it gets attached to the wall so remove your camera and see if it is getting closer to the wall and then push it down zoom in and see if there's anything sticking out all right okay so i'll just move it a little bit i'll just move this part a little bit here and i'll just duplicate this part and go to the corner so that means i have four moving parts or moving obstacles push it down okay so that should be it all right so now we have made the tunnel and next we are going to make the other obstacles so that's all for today so in the next tutorial we will learn how to code the obstacles for lasers the conveyor belt and the sliding platforms and also we'll be learning on how to make different types of obstacles which we can use for your object make sure to subscribe to our channel to check out the next video of this project and don't forget to hit the like button thank you bye
