00:00 - everyone so today we're going to be
00:02 - creating a logo
00:03 - and this logo will be using scratch and
00:06 - we'll be using some pieces of code
00:09 - to create some shapes with the help of
00:11 - the pen tool
00:12 - and then with that pen tool we're going
00:14 - to create a design
00:17 - with some code and with our mouse
00:20 - which we're going to control with our
00:21 - hands so let's begin the project
00:24 - so first we're going to click on create
00:27 - over here
00:29 - and once you click on create we'll let
00:30 - it load our project page
00:33 - the next thing we want to do is we want
00:35 - to change this
00:37 - title here to recycle
00:47 - so after we're done changing the name
00:50 - the next step
00:51 - that we need to do is we need to remove
00:54 - this character
00:55 - here and what we're going to add inside
00:58 - is we're going to add a pencil tool so
01:01 - we can
01:02 - click on choose sprite and here
01:05 - we can click on pencil
01:08 - so as we have our pencil here we want to
01:11 - change the size
01:12 - to 50 i want to make it a
01:16 - not too big size next we want to click
01:18 - on costly so in costumes what we're
01:20 - going to add
01:22 - is we're going to add different colors
01:23 - so we're going to add orange green
01:25 - blue and if you like a fourth color you
01:28 - can add one too
01:30 - so i'm gonna add orange blue green
01:33 - and perhaps maybe black or
01:37 - yellow so we have two costumes over here
01:40 - so i'm just going to stick with this one
01:42 - and i'm going to change the costume name
01:44 - to
01:44 - orange and the next thing
01:48 - is i'm going to click on the paint tool
01:50 - then i'm going to click on this
01:52 - fill and i'm going to change it to
01:54 - orange
01:56 - this would be fine then you can just
01:58 - color this part here
02:00 - and color the tip and the next thing i
02:03 - want you to do
02:04 - is i want you to click on this here and
02:07 - use
02:08 - flip horizontally and now what we want
02:10 - to do
02:11 - is we press command a or you can use
02:14 - the mouse tool here and just drag it
02:17 - like this
02:19 - just to select the whole pencil and what
02:21 - we want to do
02:22 - is we want to drag it to here
02:25 - and the reason why is because when we're
02:27 - drawing we want the pencil to be the
02:29 - same point as our
02:31 - mouse pointer on the top so we can draw
02:33 - easily
02:34 - so once we have this then
02:37 - it's very simple to move on to the next
02:39 - step we just
02:41 - right click this duplicate take out the
02:44 - same costume
02:45 - and we can change this to another color
02:47 - so we can save the screen
02:49 - and then we color our pencil
02:52 - as green so here
02:56 - and here and then the next thing we do
03:00 - we duplicate it once again
03:10 - and then we can add one more color so
03:12 - this color can be
03:14 - anything that you like so i'm just going
03:16 - to use red
03:28 - so the next thing we want to click back
03:30 - on our orange we want to change
03:32 - this position so what we want to do is
03:35 - we move our mask to direction
03:37 - and click on this make sure this is
03:39 - clicked
03:40 - and then change this direction to
03:42 - negative
03:45 - look like that and so this way it will
03:48 - follow
03:49 - our mouse when we draw and if you want
03:51 - to check it out
03:52 - actually we can do that so we can click
03:54 - on code
03:56 - move our mouse to the plus to select our
03:58 - pen tool
04:00 - and then we can simply take out a pen
04:02 - down
04:03 - and then we can click on motion take out
04:06 - a
04:08 - go to block so we should find a go to
04:10 - block here
04:11 - just make this bigger we change this to
04:14 - go to
04:15 - mouse pointer and then we're going to
04:18 - click
04:18 - on control here
04:22 - so forever put that here
04:25 - and then we click on the create
04:30 - so what this means is whenever we when
04:32 - we start you could
04:33 - constantly follow our mouse and as you
04:36 - can see here
04:37 - it's perfectly following the mouse
04:38 - pointer when we draw
04:40 - so that's pretty good so after we have
04:43 - tested that
04:44 - just remove this click back on pen
04:47 - and then we're going to take out the
04:49 - erase ball
04:51 - so as this part is done we can leave our
04:54 - pen there for now
04:55 - the next part we want to start doing is
04:57 - we want to start adding our background
05:00 - and how do we do that it's pretty simple
05:03 - so we click on our backdrops here and
05:06 - then click this
05:08 - so right now we have this backdrop which
05:10 - is plain
05:11 - then we can change the costume
05:14 - so we can change the costume name to
05:17 - white
05:17 - dg so white background then you can
05:20 - command
05:22 - then you can click control right click
05:24 - okay
05:25 - and then here you can change this to
05:28 - blue
05:29 - this will be blue background so how do
05:31 - we get this color to be blue
05:33 - it's very simple we click on convert to
05:35 - bitmap
05:36 - once we're here we can change the
05:39 - brightness
05:40 - brighter and change the color here to
05:42 - blue
05:44 - then once you click the paint tool it
05:45 - will just paint it for you
05:47 - then once again we can press ctrl right
05:49 - click duplicate
05:52 - and then what we want to do now we want
05:53 - to change this color to
05:56 - a black background
05:59 - so change this to black
06:02 - there just click on this and then just
06:04 - change the name to
06:06 - black
06:09 - so white background blue background
06:12 - black background
06:13 - so we have three different backgrounds
06:14 - and what's going to happen is we're
06:16 - going to
06:16 - change the background color whenever we
06:19 - like and we're going to put in
06:20 - a command for this
06:24 - so the next part now is we're going to
06:27 - look into making a variable called pen
06:29 - size now this variable is very important
06:31 - as what it's going to do is going to
06:33 - help us change the
06:34 - pen drawing thickness when we
06:38 - draw our recycle sign so
06:41 - to begin that we're going to click on
06:43 - pen size here
06:45 - so we're going to click on the pen here
06:47 - and click on variables
06:49 - and click on make a variable and we're
06:51 - going to call this
06:52 - pen size so once that's done
06:56 - you can keep it for there for now and
06:59 - what we want to do with this want to
07:00 - make some changes so
07:02 - first we're going to click on control
07:04 - right click
07:05 - change it to slider so slider is another
07:08 - way of setting the value
07:09 - you can change it automatically by
07:11 - moving the slider
07:12 - as you can see here the value will
07:14 - change from 0 to 100
07:16 - but we want to make some changes and
07:19 - those changes are we want to give it a
07:21 - minimum and a maximum value
07:23 - so we do the same thing we click control
07:25 - right click
07:26 - change slider range and we're changing
07:28 - the minimum value to 1
07:30 - and the maximum value to 10 so as you
07:33 - change it
07:34 - can only go from 1 to 10. you can't make
07:38 - it any different
07:39 - you can't make it a lower number than 1
07:41 - for a higher number than 10
07:42 - so that's how we're going to select our
07:45 - pen thickness
07:46 - using the slider and variable
07:52 - so now we're going to begin our code
07:54 - what do we need
07:55 - first is we want to take out an event
07:57 - block so we click on events
08:00 - and we take out a when space key pressed
08:03 - so what this is going to do for us is
08:05 - going to erase all our drawings
08:06 - on our canvas that we have here
08:10 - so to enable that we click on pen and we
08:12 - take out erase all
08:15 - and then the next step is when we start
08:17 - our
08:18 - when we start our the next step when we
08:22 - want to start our recycle activity we
08:24 - click on the
08:26 - events and take our green flag click so
08:29 - when this starts
08:30 - we want to start by setting the pen size
08:32 - variable
08:33 - so to do that we click on variable we
08:36 - take out
08:37 - set my variable to zero and then click
08:40 - on
08:40 - pen size and then inside this zero we're
08:43 - going to add a
08:44 - and size variable and why you ask that
08:47 - it's because when we change the value we
08:49 - want it to be reflected
08:51 - so once i've changed it to five i can
08:54 - click here and know the value is five
08:55 - and i want to set it to that value that
08:57 - we
08:57 - choose the next thing i want to do is i
09:00 - want to change the costume of my pen
09:03 - so i'm gonna click on looks i'm gonna go
09:06 - down
09:07 - to switch costume and change it to
09:10 - orange the next thing i would like to
09:12 - add
09:13 - is i want my pen to be shown so i'm
09:16 - going to click on looks
09:17 - and i'm going to take out show over here
09:21 - and then the next thing i want to do is
09:24 - i want to set my pet color
09:26 - so i'm going to click pen color and as
09:27 - we're making a recycling sign
09:30 - we can change the end color to green
09:34 - so change the brightness here
09:39 - and actually instead of changing this to
09:41 - orange we can also change this to green
09:44 - so after that is done what we have done
09:46 - now is when we press on the space key it
09:48 - will erase all our drawings
09:49 - when we click on the green flag it will
09:52 - collect the information that we've put
09:54 - in the pen size
09:55 - and then it'll change our costume to
09:56 - green for the pen and then it'll show
09:59 - our pen
09:59 - and then it'll also change the pen's
10:01 - color degree
10:03 - so that is the first part done next part
10:05 - is we want to add a forever loop and the
10:07 - reason why is we want to put a piece of
10:09 - code inside that will constantly run
10:11 - forever
10:12 - so first we click on control and then as
10:15 - we scroll down
10:17 - as we scroll here we click on it forever
10:19 - and then
10:20 - inside this block we're going to add a
10:22 - set pen size so we take out the
10:24 - set size here
10:28 - so instead of making it to 1 we want to
10:30 - put in our variable of pen size
10:33 - so we click on variable take out pen
10:35 - size
10:36 - and put that there the next thing we
10:38 - want to add is a conditional
10:40 - so we want to say if the mouse is down
10:43 - we want to have the pen down
10:47 - otherwise the pen will be up what that
10:49 - means is
10:50 - we want to move our pen
10:54 - using our mouse but we only wanted to
10:56 - draw when we click
10:58 - on this background so to have that
11:01 - we click on control we take out an if
11:04 - then
11:04 - else and then we scroll down we head to
11:07 - sensing
11:08 - so that is over here and then we take
11:11 - out
11:11 - our mouse down so you see here it says
11:14 - false our mass is not down as yet
11:16 - but it will only get triggered when we
11:18 - click so checks if the mouse is down
11:21 - then we have our pen move down so we
11:24 - click on this
11:25 - put it here and then
11:29 - the next part is what would happen if
11:32 - the mouse is not done that means if
11:33 - we're not clicking we don't want to draw
11:35 - anything extra
11:36 - so we take another block that is called
11:39 - pen
11:39 - up okay so this part
11:43 - is done so what this does here is
11:45 - constantly it will check the pen size
11:47 - when you start and then you'll set the
11:49 - pen size to whatever value you select
11:51 - before you start our
11:53 - project and then when you do click on
11:56 - the background
11:57 - and move your mouse it will start
11:59 - drawing a trail
12:01 - just like how when you use a pen or
12:02 - pencil and you write on a piece of paper
12:05 - if you're not clicking on the background
12:07 - then what's going to happen
12:08 - is our and would be up it would be
12:11 - like you're just moving the pen but
12:13 - you're not writing anything
12:15 - and we don't want it to write anything
12:17 - we're not clicking because it would make
12:19 - our background look messy
12:22 - so so the next part now we want to
12:26 - look at is we want to change our costume
12:28 - and also the pen color
12:31 - so we're going to add some options for
12:33 - this so we're going to click on
12:35 - events and we can take out our when
12:38 - space key pressed
12:39 - and what we want to make here is we want
12:42 - to add
12:43 - duplicates so as you know we have four
12:46 - costumes
12:47 - right so here we have four
12:51 - i'll just drag this down
12:55 - so the first thing we're going to do is
12:57 - we're going to click on looks
12:58 - and then we're going to take out a
13:01 - switch costume to
13:04 - orange we'll do the same thing for this
13:07 - here this can be green
13:11 - do the same thing for here this can be
13:14 - blue and the last one can be
13:17 - red so we can change this option so
13:21 - what i suggest is you can use numbers or
13:23 - you can use alphabets both
13:25 - work so i'm going to use a number one
13:29 - so just scroll down to the numbers so
13:31 - this will be
13:32 - one this will be two
13:36 - this shall be three
13:40 - and this shall be four now if you feel
13:43 - that all the blocks are a bit
13:44 - clunked together that's fine you can
13:46 - move your mouse here
13:48 - click on control right click clean up
13:51 - and audio blocks will be cleaned up and
13:53 - the next thing we want to do
13:54 - not only when we press on these buttons
13:58 - we want them to change costume
13:59 - would actually like them to change their
14:02 - pen colors
14:03 - and that's also very simple we click on
14:05 - pen we take out set pen color 2
14:08 - and then we can change the color here to
14:10 - orange so remember change the brightness
14:13 - increase your brightness and then here
14:15 - you can change the color
14:18 - and then the same thing goes over here
14:20 - you want to change this to green
14:24 - over here
14:28 - and then this we want to change it to
14:30 - blue
14:33 - so increase the brightness once again
14:36 - let me change this to
14:37 - blue yep i think that's fine
14:41 - and then we have red so we again take
14:43 - out segment color
14:45 - and then change this to the color red
14:51 - and then once again if it's all messy if
14:53 - you click ctrl
14:54 - right click clean up blocks and there
14:59 - right now you'll notice my pen is here
15:02 - so i'll just drag it to show you
15:04 - so i can click on two
15:11 - three four one two three four
15:14 - it changes color and also the tip
15:18 - so next thing we want to look at is we
15:20 - want to have
15:21 - our pen move so to do that we're gonna
15:25 - take out a event block
15:26 - and this block is called when this
15:28 - spread clicked so when you click on this
15:30 - pencil we wanted to do a certain action
15:32 - and that action will be to follow
15:34 - our mouse so we click now on control
15:38 - then we take okay forever put that here
15:41 - and then click on motion and we'll check
15:45 - out a
15:45 - go to block put that here change this to
15:50 - mouse pointer right so the next thing we
15:53 - want to add
15:54 - is that when we start also we want
15:57 - our pen to glide to a certain location
16:00 - so we can click on events
16:03 - here take out when green flag clicked
16:07 - and then click on pen and take out
16:11 - and up
16:14 - and then underneath we want to take out
16:16 - a glide so click on
16:18 - motion we got a glide block here
16:21 - we're going to change this to 77
16:24 - and then 123 and then we want it to
16:28 - point in
16:29 - a certain direction so we click on
16:31 - motion
16:32 - take a point in direction and we change
16:35 - this to
16:36 - 120 degrees
16:40 - so what's going to happen is when we
16:42 - click on the green flag
16:44 - the pen will go up it will glide to a
16:45 - certain position and then we'll point to
16:47 - 120 degrees
16:50 - so next what we want to add is we want
16:52 - to add a
16:53 - triangle so to do that
16:57 - it's very simple we have done it before
16:59 - click on control
17:00 - take out a repeat three so repeat 10 we
17:04 - change this to three as a triangle as
17:06 - three sides one two
17:07 - three then we take click on
17:10 - pen and take out the end down
17:14 - and what we want to do is we want to set
17:16 - the pen size
17:17 - so we click on the
17:20 - set and size here click on variables
17:24 - and add in our pen size here
17:28 - so what we want to do next is we click
17:30 - on motion
17:32 - okay move 10 steps change this to 50
17:36 - and then we have it turn right by 120
17:38 - degrees
17:39 - so we take this out put it here and
17:44 - change
17:46 - so after that's done we want it now to
17:48 - glide to another position
17:51 - so simply what we want to do is we don't
17:54 - need to
17:54 - keep on drawing another line after it's
17:56 - drawn a triangle we want it to move
17:58 - somewhere without making another
18:01 - so we click on end up
18:04 - put it here
18:09 - and then after that we once again want
18:11 - to glide to a certain position right
18:14 - here
18:14 - and we want to change the coordinates to
18:17 - minus 180
18:20 - and then the y we want to change it to
18:22 - 80.
18:27 - next we want it to point at a certain
18:29 - direction so we click
18:30 - on point in direction and we change this
18:34 - to
18:34 - 30. underneath it
18:38 - once again we want to make the same
18:41 - code here as we're making a triangle
18:43 - once again
18:44 - so you click on control take out a
18:47 - repeat three
18:49 - so repeat three times then it's the same
18:52 - thing
18:52 - we want our pen to go down then
18:55 - underneath it we want to set the pen
18:57 - size
18:58 - we take a set pin size 2 and we want to
19:01 - set it to our variable
19:02 - that is here and then under this we want
19:06 - to click click on motion
19:08 - take out the move 50 steps here
19:13 - and then we want it to once again turn
19:16 - right by
19:18 - 120
19:22 - and then the next thing is we wanted to
19:25 - make another triangle because we've
19:26 - already made the first one and the
19:28 - second one
19:29 - now we need to look on making the third
19:31 - one
19:32 - so once again we click on and
19:35 - take out the pen up here
19:40 - and then the next thing is we want to
19:41 - glide to a certain position
19:44 - so here glide and then we want to change
19:46 - this position to
19:48 - minus 5 and then we want to change the y
19:51 - to minus 47. so
19:54 - once that's done we want it to point
19:56 - again in a certain direction
19:58 - so we go to point n direction here
20:02 - minus 16. then
20:06 - once again we want to put air deep so we
20:08 - click on control
20:09 - take on this changes to three
20:13 - and then click on pen again and take out
20:16 - a pen
20:16 - down and then we want to set pen size
20:20 - 2 and we're going to change this once
20:23 - again to our variable
20:24 - and size and then
20:28 - once again we wanted to move 50 steps
20:44 - all right so as of now we're done with
20:47 - our project
20:48 - so let's look at our code here
20:51 - now we can look at our project and press
20:53 - the green flag let's see
20:54 - so it's going to make three triangles
20:58 - and then what we can do we click on it
21:00 - then we can
21:14 - then we can draw a line here
21:28 - here
21:32 - and we've made a recycle sign so you can
21:35 - add more color
21:36 - you can design it however you want and
21:38 - that is the end of our project
21:40 - and one more thing you can also re
21:43 - restart it by pressing stop and then
21:44 - start and then change your pen color
21:46 - so if you want to make it even bigger so
21:50 - that can be done you can press space
21:52 - click again
21:53 - your triangle can get bigger this is the
21:56 - end of the video

Cleaned transcript:

everyone so today we're going to be creating a logo and this logo will be using scratch and we'll be using some pieces of code to create some shapes with the help of the pen tool and then with that pen tool we're going to create a design with some code and with our mouse which we're going to control with our hands so let's begin the project so first we're going to click on create over here and once you click on create we'll let it load our project page the next thing we want to do is we want to change this title here to recycle so after we're done changing the name the next step that we need to do is we need to remove this character here and what we're going to add inside is we're going to add a pencil tool so we can click on choose sprite and here we can click on pencil so as we have our pencil here we want to change the size to 50 i want to make it a not too big size next we want to click on costly so in costumes what we're going to add is we're going to add different colors so we're going to add orange green blue and if you like a fourth color you can add one too so i'm gonna add orange blue green and perhaps maybe black or yellow so we have two costumes over here so i'm just going to stick with this one and i'm going to change the costume name to orange and the next thing is i'm going to click on the paint tool then i'm going to click on this fill and i'm going to change it to orange this would be fine then you can just color this part here and color the tip and the next thing i want you to do is i want you to click on this here and use flip horizontally and now what we want to do is we press command a or you can use the mouse tool here and just drag it like this just to select the whole pencil and what we want to do is we want to drag it to here and the reason why is because when we're drawing we want the pencil to be the same point as our mouse pointer on the top so we can draw easily so once we have this then it's very simple to move on to the next step we just right click this duplicate take out the same costume and we can change this to another color so we can save the screen and then we color our pencil as green so here and here and then the next thing we do we duplicate it once again and then we can add one more color so this color can be anything that you like so i'm just going to use red so the next thing we want to click back on our orange we want to change this position so what we want to do is we move our mask to direction and click on this make sure this is clicked and then change this direction to negative look like that and so this way it will follow our mouse when we draw and if you want to check it out actually we can do that so we can click on code move our mouse to the plus to select our pen tool and then we can simply take out a pen down and then we can click on motion take out a go to block so we should find a go to block here just make this bigger we change this to go to mouse pointer and then we're going to click on control here so forever put that here and then we click on the create so what this means is whenever we when we start you could constantly follow our mouse and as you can see here it's perfectly following the mouse pointer when we draw so that's pretty good so after we have tested that just remove this click back on pen and then we're going to take out the erase ball so as this part is done we can leave our pen there for now the next part we want to start doing is we want to start adding our background and how do we do that it's pretty simple so we click on our backdrops here and then click this so right now we have this backdrop which is plain then we can change the costume so we can change the costume name to white dg so white background then you can command then you can click control right click okay and then here you can change this to blue this will be blue background so how do we get this color to be blue it's very simple we click on convert to bitmap once we're here we can change the brightness brighter and change the color here to blue then once you click the paint tool it will just paint it for you then once again we can press ctrl right click duplicate and then what we want to do now we want to change this color to a black background so change this to black there just click on this and then just change the name to black so white background blue background black background so we have three different backgrounds and what's going to happen is we're going to change the background color whenever we like and we're going to put in a command for this so the next part now is we're going to look into making a variable called pen size now this variable is very important as what it's going to do is going to help us change the pen drawing thickness when we draw our recycle sign so to begin that we're going to click on pen size here so we're going to click on the pen here and click on variables and click on make a variable and we're going to call this pen size so once that's done you can keep it for there for now and what we want to do with this want to make some changes so first we're going to click on control right click change it to slider so slider is another way of setting the value you can change it automatically by moving the slider as you can see here the value will change from 0 to 100 but we want to make some changes and those changes are we want to give it a minimum and a maximum value so we do the same thing we click control right click change slider range and we're changing the minimum value to 1 and the maximum value to 10 so as you change it can only go from 1 to 10. you can't make it any different you can't make it a lower number than 1 for a higher number than 10 so that's how we're going to select our pen thickness using the slider and variable so now we're going to begin our code what do we need first is we want to take out an event block so we click on events and we take out a when space key pressed so what this is going to do for us is going to erase all our drawings on our canvas that we have here so to enable that we click on pen and we take out erase all and then the next step is when we start our when we start our the next step when we want to start our recycle activity we click on the events and take our green flag click so when this starts we want to start by setting the pen size variable so to do that we click on variable we take out set my variable to zero and then click on pen size and then inside this zero we're going to add a and size variable and why you ask that it's because when we change the value we want it to be reflected so once i've changed it to five i can click here and know the value is five and i want to set it to that value that we choose the next thing i want to do is i want to change the costume of my pen so i'm gonna click on looks i'm gonna go down to switch costume and change it to orange the next thing i would like to add is i want my pen to be shown so i'm going to click on looks and i'm going to take out show over here and then the next thing i want to do is i want to set my pet color so i'm going to click pen color and as we're making a recycling sign we can change the end color to green so change the brightness here and actually instead of changing this to orange we can also change this to green so after that is done what we have done now is when we press on the space key it will erase all our drawings when we click on the green flag it will collect the information that we've put in the pen size and then it'll change our costume to green for the pen and then it'll show our pen and then it'll also change the pen's color degree so that is the first part done next part is we want to add a forever loop and the reason why is we want to put a piece of code inside that will constantly run forever so first we click on control and then as we scroll down as we scroll here we click on it forever and then inside this block we're going to add a set pen size so we take out the set size here so instead of making it to 1 we want to put in our variable of pen size so we click on variable take out pen size and put that there the next thing we want to add is a conditional so we want to say if the mouse is down we want to have the pen down otherwise the pen will be up what that means is we want to move our pen using our mouse but we only wanted to draw when we click on this background so to have that we click on control we take out an if then else and then we scroll down we head to sensing so that is over here and then we take out our mouse down so you see here it says false our mass is not down as yet but it will only get triggered when we click so checks if the mouse is down then we have our pen move down so we click on this put it here and then the next part is what would happen if the mouse is not done that means if we're not clicking we don't want to draw anything extra so we take another block that is called pen up okay so this part is done so what this does here is constantly it will check the pen size when you start and then you'll set the pen size to whatever value you select before you start our project and then when you do click on the background and move your mouse it will start drawing a trail just like how when you use a pen or pencil and you write on a piece of paper if you're not clicking on the background then what's going to happen is our and would be up it would be like you're just moving the pen but you're not writing anything and we don't want it to write anything we're not clicking because it would make our background look messy so so the next part now we want to look at is we want to change our costume and also the pen color so we're going to add some options for this so we're going to click on events and we can take out our when space key pressed and what we want to make here is we want to add duplicates so as you know we have four costumes right so here we have four i'll just drag this down so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to click on looks and then we're going to take out a switch costume to orange we'll do the same thing for this here this can be green do the same thing for here this can be blue and the last one can be red so we can change this option so what i suggest is you can use numbers or you can use alphabets both work so i'm going to use a number one so just scroll down to the numbers so this will be one this will be two this shall be three and this shall be four now if you feel that all the blocks are a bit clunked together that's fine you can move your mouse here click on control right click clean up and audio blocks will be cleaned up and the next thing we want to do not only when we press on these buttons we want them to change costume would actually like them to change their pen colors and that's also very simple we click on pen we take out set pen color 2 and then we can change the color here to orange so remember change the brightness increase your brightness and then here you can change the color and then the same thing goes over here you want to change this to green over here and then this we want to change it to blue so increase the brightness once again let me change this to blue yep i think that's fine and then we have red so we again take out segment color and then change this to the color red and then once again if it's all messy if you click ctrl right click clean up blocks and there right now you'll notice my pen is here so i'll just drag it to show you so i can click on two three four one two three four it changes color and also the tip so next thing we want to look at is we want to have our pen move so to do that we're gonna take out a event block and this block is called when this spread clicked so when you click on this pencil we wanted to do a certain action and that action will be to follow our mouse so we click now on control then we take okay forever put that here and then click on motion and we'll check out a go to block put that here change this to mouse pointer right so the next thing we want to add is that when we start also we want our pen to glide to a certain location so we can click on events here take out when green flag clicked and then click on pen and take out and up and then underneath we want to take out a glide so click on motion we got a glide block here we're going to change this to 77 and then 123 and then we want it to point in a certain direction so we click on motion take a point in direction and we change this to 120 degrees so what's going to happen is when we click on the green flag the pen will go up it will glide to a certain position and then we'll point to 120 degrees so next what we want to add is we want to add a triangle so to do that it's very simple we have done it before click on control take out a repeat three so repeat 10 we change this to three as a triangle as three sides one two three then we take click on pen and take out the end down and what we want to do is we want to set the pen size so we click on the set and size here click on variables and add in our pen size here so what we want to do next is we click on motion okay move 10 steps change this to 50 and then we have it turn right by 120 degrees so we take this out put it here and change so after that's done we want it now to glide to another position so simply what we want to do is we don't need to keep on drawing another line after it's drawn a triangle we want it to move somewhere without making another so we click on end up put it here and then after that we once again want to glide to a certain position right here and we want to change the coordinates to minus 180 and then the y we want to change it to 80. next we want it to point at a certain direction so we click on point in direction and we change this to 30. underneath it once again we want to make the same code here as we're making a triangle once again so you click on control take out a repeat three so repeat three times then it's the same thing we want our pen to go down then underneath it we want to set the pen size we take a set pin size 2 and we want to set it to our variable that is here and then under this we want to click click on motion take out the move 50 steps here and then we want it to once again turn right by 120 and then the next thing is we wanted to make another triangle because we've already made the first one and the second one now we need to look on making the third one so once again we click on and take out the pen up here and then the next thing is we want to glide to a certain position so here glide and then we want to change this position to minus 5 and then we want to change the y to minus 47. so once that's done we want it to point again in a certain direction so we go to point n direction here minus 16. then once again we want to put air deep so we click on control take on this changes to three and then click on pen again and take out a pen down and then we want to set pen size 2 and we're going to change this once again to our variable and size and then once again we wanted to move 50 steps all right so as of now we're done with our project so let's look at our code here now we can look at our project and press the green flag let's see so it's going to make three triangles and then what we can do we click on it then we can then we can draw a line here here and we've made a recycle sign so you can add more color you can design it however you want and that is the end of our project and one more thing you can also re restart it by pressing stop and then start and then change your pen color so if you want to make it even bigger so that can be done you can press space click again your triangle can get bigger this is the end of the video i hope you like making the project if you liked this video please make sure to like share this video and also
