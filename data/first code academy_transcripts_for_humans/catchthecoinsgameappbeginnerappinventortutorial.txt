00:01 - hello everyone welcome back to
00:03 - first codes youtube channel today we're
00:05 - going to be creating a fun game related
00:07 - to
00:08 - chinese new year on app inventor so just
00:10 - to give a little bit of context in this
00:12 - app we will get to collect gold
00:14 - coins by dragging our character in on
00:17 - the screen and then having our character
00:19 - touch the gold coins every time
00:23 - the character touches a gold coin one
00:26 - point gets added to our total points
00:29 - so something like this where i drag the
00:31 - character
00:32 - and i try to collect the gold points and
00:33 - my score goes up
00:38 - all right so let's get started on our
00:40 - project so whenever you're
00:42 - creating a new project in mit app
00:44 - inventor
00:45 - there's various ways of doing it
00:47 - obviously one of the ways is to manually
00:49 - add all of your components
00:51 - and your characters and all that but the
00:53 - easier way and the more convenient which
00:55 - i'm going to be using right now is to
00:57 - just upload a
00:58 - aia file um which includes all of your
01:01 - characters and sounds and components
01:03 - that you need for your project
01:05 - that's what i have here get the coins
01:06 - dot aia and i'm gonna have the exact
01:08 - same file
01:09 - uh linked in the description box below
01:11 - so be sure to check it out if you guys
01:13 - are interested in doing the same product
01:14 - now i'm about to do right now
01:16 - right so now that i have this imported
01:18 - i'm just going to press
01:19 - ok and it's going to create a new
01:21 - project
01:22 - called get the coin and i'm going to
01:24 - click on that
01:30 - so here is the page that i have
01:33 - um and you can see that there's two
01:35 - screens there's the main screen and the
01:37 - screen
01:37 - one uh the difference between the two is
01:40 - if you go back to the demo
01:42 - a little bit uh before this i
01:45 - showed you there's like a home screen
01:47 - where i can just press
01:48 - start in order to start the game so
01:50 - that's the main screen and screen one is
01:52 - here where the player actually gets to
01:54 - play the game
01:55 - so you can see all the components
01:57 - uploaded all the gold coins six of them
01:59 - and then the pirate sprite which is this
02:00 - character that's moving around right
02:02 - here
02:03 - um so right now we're in the designer
02:06 - tab
02:07 - we want to move to the blocks tab in
02:09 - order to get started with the coding
02:11 - right so this part of the code will help
02:13 - us to click on the start button
02:15 - to help us go to the next screen you're
02:17 - going to find this in a lot of games
02:19 - nowadays where there's a home page and
02:22 - first is the home page and once you
02:24 - click on a start button on somewhere on
02:26 - the home page then it leads you to the
02:28 - player screen where you get to actually
02:30 - play the game so to get started uh let's
02:33 - click
02:33 - on button one if you scroll down a
02:35 - little bit
02:36 - uh before first we have to go to main
02:38 - screen right and we're gonna click on
02:40 - button one
02:42 - and then we're gonna click when button
02:45 - one dot click
02:47 - right so this is basically saying when i
02:48 - click on the button
02:50 - something happens and the something that
02:51 - we wanted to happen is to open another
02:54 - screen
02:55 - and another screen that we want to open
02:57 - is screen one because right now we're on
02:58 - the home screen or main screen
03:00 - right but we want to open screen one so
03:03 - to do that
03:04 - let's go back and click on control
03:07 - and then there should be an open another
03:10 - screen screen name
03:11 - and we want to specify the screen name
03:14 - and how we do that is we click on text
03:17 - and there should be a double quote with
03:18 - empty blank
03:20 - and click that there and the name of our
03:23 - screen that we want to move to is green
03:24 - one
03:25 - so we just copy that name into this box
03:27 - right here so screen
03:29 - one all right so this is all we have to
03:31 - do basically for
03:33 - the main screen right it's just click on
03:35 - a button that's all you can do
03:37 - so now we want to move on to our player
03:39 - screen which is called screen one
03:41 - and we're going to
03:44 - code our character and give it the
03:45 - ability to sense our finger
03:47 - when we press it on the screen right in
03:50 - order to drag it
03:51 - along the screen so when i have my mouse
03:54 - on the pirate sprite i can move the
03:56 - power spot around in order to collect
03:57 - the coins
03:59 - so that's what we have to do first so
04:01 - the same thing with the button to
04:03 - um code the pyrosprite uh or the
04:06 - character at hand we're just gonna
04:08 - press on pirate sprite and then what we
04:11 - want to do is we want to get the when
04:13 - pyrosprite.drag because it's just going
04:15 - to be
04:17 - our power supply is going to be
04:18 - following our mouse
04:21 - so what we wanted to do is we want to
04:23 - set the location of the pyrosprite to
04:26 - the location of our mouse
04:28 - um so to do that you just want to say um
04:32 - set character 2
04:35 - on dot x and set creator to that y
04:39 - um to search a number oops there we go
04:42 - okay so let's press on set character
04:45 - uh set pirate dot x
04:49 - and then we want to do the same thing
04:50 - for the y um but let's just
04:52 - finish with the x part coding first so
04:56 - we want to set the pirate sprite.x
04:58 - to the current x position so we want to
05:01 - do is get the
05:03 - get block so let's go
05:07 - to variables and get the get
05:10 - and then we're going to paste that here
05:12 - and what what do we want to get we want
05:13 - to get the current
05:14 - x position um but this is not we this is
05:18 - half of what we have to do right we have
05:19 - to also do the same thing with our y
05:22 - um but i think this is a good point to
05:26 - uh tell you about an easy way to copy
05:28 - paste blocks
05:29 - in mit app inventor so obviously you
05:32 - don't if you're going to do a similar
05:33 - thing over and over again this is just
05:35 - an example we're only going to do it
05:36 - twice
05:36 - um but in other examples that we're
05:38 - going to be i'm going to be showing
05:40 - you later we're going to be um coding
05:43 - similar blocks for but very very subtle
05:46 - differences
05:47 - so an easy way to do it is you can
05:49 - actually use the backpack and store
05:51 - blocks of code and then you can just
05:54 - drag
05:55 - those blocks of code that you copied
05:57 - into the backpack whenever you need to
05:58 - use it so
05:59 - if i click on my backpack right now you
06:01 - can already see some of the
06:04 - blocks that i already have copied into
06:06 - here um but i'm going to show example of
06:09 - exactly how to actually
06:10 - get these blocks into there what you
06:12 - want to do is just drag it and then the
06:14 - backpack should open up
06:15 - like that and once it it's open you just
06:18 - gotta drop it in
06:19 - and then if you open a backpack you can
06:22 - see that my block is copied
06:24 - so now i can drag this block out and you
06:26 - can see that there's a copy created so
06:28 - uh let's go back and put this in and
06:30 - then we gotta put this in
06:32 - but we gotta create with the y because
06:34 - we already did the x position
06:37 - good so now we want to do is we want to
06:40 - make sure that a character doesn't go
06:42 - off screen right
06:44 - um we don't really want it to go off
06:46 - screen because that'd be a little bit
06:47 - weird
06:48 - so to do that you want to go into
06:51 - uh the character or the pirate sprite
06:55 - component back again and then you want
06:57 - to get the when pirate sprite the edge
06:59 - reached and then after i get this one um
07:02 - i want to make sure that my uh
07:05 - pirate sprite doesn't go off screen so
07:07 - to do that you want to actually get the
07:09 - call pirates right dot bounce edge
07:13 - and then we want to specify the edge
07:16 - which is going to be
07:17 - um similar to our x and y which we're
07:20 - going to just get
07:21 - get and instead of saying current x and
07:23 - current y we want to say the edge
07:25 - right so now we have all our code so to
07:28 - make sure that our power sprite doesn't
07:29 - go off screen
07:30 - and also that we can drag our power
07:32 - sprite with our mouse
07:33 - cool cool okay
07:37 - so the next part of the code is um
07:40 - we're gonna have a clock in the game and
07:42 - this clock is going to help us move
07:44 - our gold coins around the screen so
07:48 - same thing that we did with the pirate
07:49 - sprite we want to uh code the clock now
07:52 - so we want to
07:53 - press clock 1 and then i'm going to get
07:56 - the uh
07:58 - when clock1.timer block all right so
08:01 - let's get this block right here
08:04 - and then the next thing that i want to
08:06 - do is to make sure that our coins are
08:08 - all
08:09 - in a different position every single
08:11 - time it disappears so
08:12 - again if you don't remember how the game
08:14 - works be sure to go back
08:17 - to the beginning of the weird video
08:18 - where i have a demo of the game
08:21 - but basically long story short i have
08:23 - this pirate sprite
08:24 - which is going to be used to collect all
08:26 - the coins that are
08:27 - popping in and out of certain locations
08:30 - and
08:30 - i want them to pop in and out in random
08:33 - locations every single time i don't want
08:34 - them to appear in the same spot
08:36 - so to do that uh we're going gonna go to
08:39 - gold coin
08:40 - one and then we're going to get the call
08:43 - uh gold one gold coin one dot move two
08:49 - and then in terms of the x and y um we
08:53 - want to make it a
08:54 - random number so
08:57 - to do that you want to go to math and
08:59 - then you're going to want to get
09:01 - the random integer from
09:05 - 1 to something right but we want to make
09:08 - it one we can just make a zero
09:10 - right and then we want to make a hundred
09:12 - because we're not really sure how big is
09:13 - it going to be but
09:15 - we want to make it big enough to fit the
09:17 - screen
09:18 - so to do that we actually have to
09:21 - operate some kind of operation a
09:22 - subtraction operation between the width
09:24 - of the canvas
09:25 - or the screen and then the width of the
09:28 - coin
09:29 - so to do that you want to actually go to
09:31 - math again and then get the
09:33 - minus operation
09:36 - if i can find that there it is
09:40 - i'm going to put it here and i don't
09:41 - need 100 anymore so you can just toss it
09:43 - into the trash
09:45 - right and what goes into these two
09:47 - blanks
09:48 - so the two blanks as i mentioned before
09:50 - is going to be a subtraction of
09:52 - uh the width of the gold coin from the
09:55 - width of the canvas
09:57 - so uh to get the width of the canvas you
09:59 - want to get the canvas
10:00 - one dot width um
10:04 - block right here and we put that in the
10:06 - first blank and then into the second
10:08 - blank
10:08 - same thing but we are going to subtract
10:11 - with the width of the gold coin instead
10:13 - of the canvas
10:14 - so let's go ahead and get the gold coin
10:17 - one
10:18 - dot uh width
10:22 - and plop that into there right
10:25 - and then that's fine and then we have to
10:28 - do the same thing
10:29 - for the height right this is just for
10:30 - the width but we also do have to do the
10:32 - same thing for the height because x
10:33 - is the width and y is the height
10:35 - represents uh them
10:37 - respectively um but this is good
10:39 - practice
10:40 - because we have this huge block of a
10:42 - relatively big block of code
10:45 - but it'd be kind of too much work to um
10:48 - do this all over again unless you want
10:50 - to it's personal preference
10:52 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
10:54 - drag this into our backpack and then
10:56 - it's going to
10:56 - create it a copy of it so now i have a
10:59 - copy of it i'm going to
11:00 - just going to drag it out and then i'm
11:01 - going to drag this back into its
11:03 - original position i'm going to drag this
11:04 - into the y position
11:06 - um so most of it's going to be the same
11:08 - except we got to change it to the height
11:10 - instead of the width because we're
11:13 - dealing with the y-coordinate
11:17 - good so now we have both the x and the y
11:21 - um generating these like random integers
11:24 - right but this is only for the first
11:26 - gold coin i have six of them
11:28 - so now i have to do the same thing for
11:30 - all six but imagine how much work that
11:32 - would be to
11:33 - do all of that uh from calling the gold
11:37 - one dot move two and then
11:38 - creating all these random integers so
11:40 - let's do the same thing again so we're
11:41 - gonna put this
11:42 - huge block of code into your backpack
11:44 - and then now
11:46 - you should see that there's a copy of it
11:48 - right here
11:50 - and again we're gonna do the same thing
11:52 - again
11:53 - because we have six coins so this is
11:55 - three
11:57 - and then this is four
12:01 - this is five scroll down i'm gonna zoom
12:04 - out a bit so you guys can see the
12:06 - uh bigger picture what's the one two
12:08 - three four five i need one more
12:10 - so let's drag that out
12:13 - now i have six and obviously we still
12:15 - have a
12:16 - some um a few things to change uh
12:20 - we have to change this to gold coin.2
12:22 - and here we also have to change
12:24 - it to gold coin at two and we have to do
12:26 - that for
12:27 - the rest of them all the way till six so
12:28 - let's do that 1.3
12:32 - uh gold coin three gold coin three and
12:34 - then this gold coin
12:36 - four gold coin four
12:39 - uh gold coin now four and then this is
12:42 - going to be 1.5
12:44 - 0.5 gold point five
12:47 - scroll down and then gold coin six
12:52 - gold coin six and gold coin six
12:56 - right so now we all have all these
12:58 - blocks
13:00 - so now we're going to be moving on to
13:02 - when the
13:03 - um the situation when the pyro spray
13:05 - actually collects the coins right so
13:07 - when they
13:07 - when the power supply collects the coins
13:08 - what happens our score goes up so that's
13:11 - something that we also have to deal with
13:12 - right
13:14 - okay so
13:18 - um in this particle we're going to code
13:19 - what happens when our character collides
13:21 - so each time our character clients right
13:23 - now just like i said before they're
13:24 - going to get a point and
13:25 - it's going to be added to our total
13:27 - score but at the same time when our
13:29 - character touches a gold coin
13:30 - not only does our score goes up about
13:33 - but the gold coin actually disappears
13:35 - so let's get started with that portion
13:37 - um let me zoom out a bit so just in case
13:39 - that you guys were not able to catch the
13:41 - first part of what we did i have this
13:44 - all here
13:45 - zoom this let's move this to the side uh
13:48 - you guys have a moment
13:50 - all right so in terms of how to deal
13:52 - with the collision
13:54 - uh let's go back into our pirate sprite
13:57 - component and then get the collided with
14:00 - block
14:00 - this time and then we're going to have a
14:04 - bunch of if statements of when
14:05 - um our gold coin is colliding with
14:08 - the pirate sprite then it's going to do
14:10 - something but we also have six gold
14:12 - coins we're gonna have to do
14:13 - a similar thing of duplicating code six
14:16 - times
14:17 - right so let's go ahead and get our if
14:20 - statement
14:21 - and if and then statement and that
14:23 - should be
14:24 - in the control and i'm gonna grab this
14:29 - if then so if what goes in our if
14:32 - statement we're going to be
14:33 - checking if our character is colliding
14:35 - with our
14:36 - uh gold coin so to do that
14:40 - let's go back into our pirate sprite and
14:42 - get
14:43 - the call pirate sprite colliding with
14:47 - so let's get that right
14:51 - so now that i have that um what is my
14:54 - pirate sprite colliding with in my first
14:56 - situation obviously is going to be the
14:57 - gold coin
14:59 - um so let's go to gold coin one gold
15:01 - coin one
15:02 - and then we should be able to grab the
15:05 - gold coin run right here gold coin one
15:06 - oops
15:08 - all right so now that i was able to get
15:10 - the gold coin one block
15:12 - we're just going to paste that into the
15:13 - colliding with other and then we now
15:16 - have to deal with the
15:17 - then segment so we deal with the if
15:18 - statement but now we have to deal with
15:20 - our density
15:21 - so the dense statement we're just going
15:23 - to create a sound and use the
15:25 - gold coin sound component that we
15:27 - already uploaded into
15:29 - our app inventor so what we want to do
15:31 - is go to
15:32 - coin sound and click on that and then
15:34 - get the call points on that play which
15:36 - is just going to allow our
15:38 - sound to play and then we also have to
15:41 - set
15:42 - um our gold point one to um
15:45 - false in terms of visibility because we
15:48 - want the gold coin one to disappear from
15:50 - its spot that it's currently in
15:52 - so um let's get the set gold coin one
15:55 - dot visible
15:57 - two and put that right below our plane
16:04 - and we want the set to visib since the
16:07 - gold coin ones.visibility is equal to
16:09 - true right now
16:10 - we want to set it equal to false and
16:12 - you're gonna find that in the logic
16:14 - so let's paste the false in there and
16:17 - then the next thing that we want to do
16:18 - um is also to increase our score right
16:21 - because we
16:22 - this situation is basically just saying
16:23 - if my pirate spider is touching my gold
16:26 - coin one
16:26 - then i want my score to increase so
16:30 - um what we want to do for the score uh
16:32 - so we go
16:33 - scroll down go to score and then we want
16:35 - to get the setscore.txt
16:38 - um setscore.txt file
16:42 - or block then we're going to paste that
16:46 - right below our and i want to set it to
16:52 - the current score.text plus one
16:55 - so plus one we're going to go back to
16:56 - math to find the operations to do that
16:58 - and we're going to paste the plus and
17:01 - then what i want to do
17:02 - in the two spaces here is obviously i
17:05 - want to add one to
17:06 - the first spot right because i want to
17:10 - increment my score by
17:12 - number of one and then in our first spot
17:15 - we're just going to
17:16 - grab our current score so to do that
17:21 - we're going to go back to score and then
17:23 - score.txt we're going to paste it into
17:25 - there
17:26 - so now our score.txt is going to be plus
17:29 - equals to 1
17:31 - when it's colliding with our pirate
17:32 - sprite okay
17:34 - good so we have this code uh done for
17:37 - our gold coin
17:39 - one right but remember that we have five
17:42 - more coins that we have to deal with
17:44 - so let's do the same thing of copy
17:46 - pasting the code so let's put this into
17:48 - the backpack
17:48 - and create more copies of the exact same
17:51 - code so let's grab this
17:52 - so now i have two but i need
17:56 - four more so let's grab four more of
17:58 - those so
17:59 - one
18:05 - two
18:09 - three
18:12 - scroll down a little bit and then we
18:15 - have our fourth round i'm gonna paste
18:16 - that
18:17 - in there and then like before we have to
18:20 - change
18:21 - our uh gold coin one spot to the
18:24 - respective gold coin number
18:26 - so we're gonna change here to gold point
18:27 - two
18:30 - and then change here to gold coin three
18:33 - change here to go point three and change
18:36 - here to gold coin four
18:39 - oops did i skip oh yeah i was skipping
18:42 - okay so this is gold coin four let's go
18:45 - coin four
18:46 - scroll down and then this will be gold
18:49 - point five
18:50 - this is gonna be gold point five and
18:51 - this would be gold coin six this would
18:53 - equal coin
18:54 - six so that was pretty easy using our
18:57 - backpack in order to copy paste code
18:59 - and the last thing that we have to do is
19:01 - actually uh create the reset button
19:04 - so we had a reset button at the bottom
19:06 - left hand of the screen and this is just
19:08 - to reset
19:09 - the coins so that we can start grabbing
19:11 - all the
19:12 - coins right um and
19:15 - it another thing that this reset button
19:17 - should do is also bring back our score
19:19 - back to zero
19:20 - um so in terms of doing the reset button
19:23 - let's click on the reset button and get
19:25 - the when resabound.click
19:27 - to make sure something happens when we
19:29 - click on the reset button
19:30 - and what do we want to happen uh we want
19:33 - all our coins
19:34 - back to be visible right um just like at
19:36 - the very start we're just resetting
19:38 - the game resetting all the plates and
19:39 - the components
19:41 - so to do that we're going to go to
19:43 - button one and get the setcoin1.visible
19:47 - and what do we want to make it since
19:50 - we're starting over we don't want it to
19:52 - be false right we want it
19:53 - so that it's true so let's go to logic
19:56 - and get the true
19:59 - and that's all we have to do but
20:01 - remember we have six
20:03 - um coins so let's put this into a backup
20:06 - again
20:10 - and then we're going to get uh
20:14 - five more of those
20:21 - four five
20:28 - six and let's change these to the
20:30 - respective coin numbers three
20:32 - four five
20:36 - six good and then this isn't all we have
20:38 - to do actually we still have to set
20:40 - our score to zero right um so just like
20:44 - we
20:44 - set our score dot exe to score dot txt
20:47 - plus one
20:48 - now we just have to set it back to zero
20:51 - so let's go to
20:52 - score and then get the set score.txt2
20:56 - and then instead of saying plus equals
20:58 - one we wanna say equal to zero
21:02 - so let's just paste that here and then
21:03 - all i have to do is put this inside of
21:05 - the one reset button up click
21:07 - all right cool um so now that we have
21:10 - this
21:10 - uh we have both of our screens our main
21:14 - screen and our screen run code
21:17 - develop so now what we want to do is you
21:20 - can use
21:21 - um an emulator or your phone
21:25 - in order to actually simulate this game
21:27 - i have a emulator called bluestacks on
21:29 - my computer
21:30 - so that's what i'm going to be using in
21:32 - order to demo this um
21:34 - application that we just made so let's
21:37 - get
21:37 - that started so i'm just going to copy
21:41 - paste it onto the screen i'm going to
21:42 - show you guys what we have made
21:44 - so far hopefully you guys were able to
21:45 - get to the
21:47 - end just like i am at
21:58 - cool okay so
22:01 - this is what i have right here
22:04 - um this is just the copy of the game
22:06 - that we just made
22:07 - and then this is the home screen right
22:09 - and when you press start here
22:11 - uh then i reach the player screen where
22:13 - i get to drag
22:14 - my character and my score goes up
22:17 - as i touch the gold coins right you see
22:19 - my score is five but then when i touch
22:21 - the gold coin goes to six
22:22 - right now our coins are all gone and i
22:25 - want to play again so i just have to
22:27 - press my reset
22:28 - then i can start playing again and my
22:30 - score goes up again
22:36 - so that's all for today i hope you all
22:38 - enjoyed
22:39 - watching this tutorial if you guys want
22:42 - to watch
22:42 - tutorials like this be sure to like our
22:45 - videos and subscribe
22:46 - uh that's all i have for today thank you
22:49 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to first codes youtube channel today we're going to be creating a fun game related to chinese new year on app inventor so just to give a little bit of context in this app we will get to collect gold coins by dragging our character in on the screen and then having our character touch the gold coins every time the character touches a gold coin one point gets added to our total points so something like this where i drag the character and i try to collect the gold points and my score goes up all right so let's get started on our project so whenever you're creating a new project in mit app inventor there's various ways of doing it obviously one of the ways is to manually add all of your components and your characters and all that but the easier way and the more convenient which i'm going to be using right now is to just upload a aia file um which includes all of your characters and sounds and components that you need for your project that's what i have here get the coins dot aia and i'm gonna have the exact same file uh linked in the description box below so be sure to check it out if you guys are interested in doing the same product now i'm about to do right now right so now that i have this imported i'm just going to press ok and it's going to create a new project called get the coin and i'm going to click on that so here is the page that i have um and you can see that there's two screens there's the main screen and the screen one uh the difference between the two is if you go back to the demo a little bit uh before this i showed you there's like a home screen where i can just press start in order to start the game so that's the main screen and screen one is here where the player actually gets to play the game so you can see all the components uploaded all the gold coins six of them and then the pirate sprite which is this character that's moving around right here um so right now we're in the designer tab we want to move to the blocks tab in order to get started with the coding right so this part of the code will help us to click on the start button to help us go to the next screen you're going to find this in a lot of games nowadays where there's a home page and first is the home page and once you click on a start button on somewhere on the home page then it leads you to the player screen where you get to actually play the game so to get started uh let's click on button one if you scroll down a little bit uh before first we have to go to main screen right and we're gonna click on button one and then we're gonna click when button one dot click right so this is basically saying when i click on the button something happens and the something that we wanted to happen is to open another screen and another screen that we want to open is screen one because right now we're on the home screen or main screen right but we want to open screen one so to do that let's go back and click on control and then there should be an open another screen screen name and we want to specify the screen name and how we do that is we click on text and there should be a double quote with empty blank and click that there and the name of our screen that we want to move to is green one so we just copy that name into this box right here so screen one all right so this is all we have to do basically for the main screen right it's just click on a button that's all you can do so now we want to move on to our player screen which is called screen one and we're going to code our character and give it the ability to sense our finger when we press it on the screen right in order to drag it along the screen so when i have my mouse on the pirate sprite i can move the power spot around in order to collect the coins so that's what we have to do first so the same thing with the button to um code the pyrosprite uh or the character at hand we're just gonna press on pirate sprite and then what we want to do is we want to get the when pyrosprite.drag because it's just going to be our power supply is going to be following our mouse so what we wanted to do is we want to set the location of the pyrosprite to the location of our mouse um so to do that you just want to say um set character 2 on dot x and set creator to that y um to search a number oops there we go okay so let's press on set character uh set pirate dot x and then we want to do the same thing for the y um but let's just finish with the x part coding first so we want to set the pirate sprite.x to the current x position so we want to do is get the get block so let's go to variables and get the get and then we're going to paste that here and what what do we want to get we want to get the current x position um but this is not we this is half of what we have to do right we have to also do the same thing with our y um but i think this is a good point to uh tell you about an easy way to copy paste blocks in mit app inventor so obviously you don't if you're going to do a similar thing over and over again this is just an example we're only going to do it twice um but in other examples that we're going to be i'm going to be showing you later we're going to be um coding similar blocks for but very very subtle differences so an easy way to do it is you can actually use the backpack and store blocks of code and then you can just drag those blocks of code that you copied into the backpack whenever you need to use it so if i click on my backpack right now you can already see some of the blocks that i already have copied into here um but i'm going to show example of exactly how to actually get these blocks into there what you want to do is just drag it and then the backpack should open up like that and once it it's open you just gotta drop it in and then if you open a backpack you can see that my block is copied so now i can drag this block out and you can see that there's a copy created so uh let's go back and put this in and then we gotta put this in but we gotta create with the y because we already did the x position good so now we want to do is we want to make sure that a character doesn't go off screen right um we don't really want it to go off screen because that'd be a little bit weird so to do that you want to go into uh the character or the pirate sprite component back again and then you want to get the when pirate sprite the edge reached and then after i get this one um i want to make sure that my uh pirate sprite doesn't go off screen so to do that you want to actually get the call pirates right dot bounce edge and then we want to specify the edge which is going to be um similar to our x and y which we're going to just get get and instead of saying current x and current y we want to say the edge right so now we have all our code so to make sure that our power sprite doesn't go off screen and also that we can drag our power sprite with our mouse cool cool okay so the next part of the code is um we're gonna have a clock in the game and this clock is going to help us move our gold coins around the screen so same thing that we did with the pirate sprite we want to uh code the clock now so we want to press clock 1 and then i'm going to get the uh when clock1.timer block all right so let's get this block right here and then the next thing that i want to do is to make sure that our coins are all in a different position every single time it disappears so again if you don't remember how the game works be sure to go back to the beginning of the weird video where i have a demo of the game but basically long story short i have this pirate sprite which is going to be used to collect all the coins that are popping in and out of certain locations and i want them to pop in and out in random locations every single time i don't want them to appear in the same spot so to do that uh we're going gonna go to gold coin one and then we're going to get the call uh gold one gold coin one dot move two and then in terms of the x and y um we want to make it a random number so to do that you want to go to math and then you're going to want to get the random integer from 1 to something right but we want to make it one we can just make a zero right and then we want to make a hundred because we're not really sure how big is it going to be but we want to make it big enough to fit the screen so to do that we actually have to operate some kind of operation a subtraction operation between the width of the canvas or the screen and then the width of the coin so to do that you want to actually go to math again and then get the minus operation if i can find that there it is i'm going to put it here and i don't need 100 anymore so you can just toss it into the trash right and what goes into these two blanks so the two blanks as i mentioned before is going to be a subtraction of uh the width of the gold coin from the width of the canvas so uh to get the width of the canvas you want to get the canvas one dot width um block right here and we put that in the first blank and then into the second blank same thing but we are going to subtract with the width of the gold coin instead of the canvas so let's go ahead and get the gold coin one dot uh width and plop that into there right and then that's fine and then we have to do the same thing for the height right this is just for the width but we also do have to do the same thing for the height because x is the width and y is the height represents uh them respectively um but this is good practice because we have this huge block of a relatively big block of code but it'd be kind of too much work to um do this all over again unless you want to it's personal preference so what i'm going to do is i'm going to drag this into our backpack and then it's going to create it a copy of it so now i have a copy of it i'm going to just going to drag it out and then i'm going to drag this back into its original position i'm going to drag this into the y position um so most of it's going to be the same except we got to change it to the height instead of the width because we're dealing with the ycoordinate good so now we have both the x and the y um generating these like random integers right but this is only for the first gold coin i have six of them so now i have to do the same thing for all six but imagine how much work that would be to do all of that uh from calling the gold one dot move two and then creating all these random integers so let's do the same thing again so we're gonna put this huge block of code into your backpack and then now you should see that there's a copy of it right here and again we're gonna do the same thing again because we have six coins so this is three and then this is four this is five scroll down i'm gonna zoom out a bit so you guys can see the uh bigger picture what's the one two three four five i need one more so let's drag that out now i have six and obviously we still have a some um a few things to change uh we have to change this to gold coin.2 and here we also have to change it to gold coin at two and we have to do that for the rest of them all the way till six so let's do that 1.3 uh gold coin three gold coin three and then this gold coin four gold coin four uh gold coin now four and then this is going to be 1.5 0.5 gold point five scroll down and then gold coin six gold coin six and gold coin six right so now we all have all these blocks so now we're going to be moving on to when the um the situation when the pyro spray actually collects the coins right so when they when the power supply collects the coins what happens our score goes up so that's something that we also have to deal with right okay so um in this particle we're going to code what happens when our character collides so each time our character clients right now just like i said before they're going to get a point and it's going to be added to our total score but at the same time when our character touches a gold coin not only does our score goes up about but the gold coin actually disappears so let's get started with that portion um let me zoom out a bit so just in case that you guys were not able to catch the first part of what we did i have this all here zoom this let's move this to the side uh you guys have a moment all right so in terms of how to deal with the collision uh let's go back into our pirate sprite component and then get the collided with block this time and then we're going to have a bunch of if statements of when um our gold coin is colliding with the pirate sprite then it's going to do something but we also have six gold coins we're gonna have to do a similar thing of duplicating code six times right so let's go ahead and get our if statement and if and then statement and that should be in the control and i'm gonna grab this if then so if what goes in our if statement we're going to be checking if our character is colliding with our uh gold coin so to do that let's go back into our pirate sprite and get the call pirate sprite colliding with so let's get that right so now that i have that um what is my pirate sprite colliding with in my first situation obviously is going to be the gold coin um so let's go to gold coin one gold coin one and then we should be able to grab the gold coin run right here gold coin one oops all right so now that i was able to get the gold coin one block we're just going to paste that into the colliding with other and then we now have to deal with the then segment so we deal with the if statement but now we have to deal with our density so the dense statement we're just going to create a sound and use the gold coin sound component that we already uploaded into our app inventor so what we want to do is go to coin sound and click on that and then get the call points on that play which is just going to allow our sound to play and then we also have to set um our gold point one to um false in terms of visibility because we want the gold coin one to disappear from its spot that it's currently in so um let's get the set gold coin one dot visible two and put that right below our plane and we want the set to visib since the gold coin ones.visibility is equal to true right now we want to set it equal to false and you're gonna find that in the logic so let's paste the false in there and then the next thing that we want to do um is also to increase our score right because we this situation is basically just saying if my pirate spider is touching my gold coin one then i want my score to increase so um what we want to do for the score uh so we go scroll down go to score and then we want to get the setscore.txt um setscore.txt file or block then we're going to paste that right below our and i want to set it to the current score.text plus one so plus one we're going to go back to math to find the operations to do that and we're going to paste the plus and then what i want to do in the two spaces here is obviously i want to add one to the first spot right because i want to increment my score by number of one and then in our first spot we're just going to grab our current score so to do that we're going to go back to score and then score.txt we're going to paste it into there so now our score.txt is going to be plus equals to 1 when it's colliding with our pirate sprite okay good so we have this code uh done for our gold coin one right but remember that we have five more coins that we have to deal with so let's do the same thing of copy pasting the code so let's put this into the backpack and create more copies of the exact same code so let's grab this so now i have two but i need four more so let's grab four more of those so one two three scroll down a little bit and then we have our fourth round i'm gonna paste that in there and then like before we have to change our uh gold coin one spot to the respective gold coin number so we're gonna change here to gold point two and then change here to gold coin three change here to go point three and change here to gold coin four oops did i skip oh yeah i was skipping okay so this is gold coin four let's go coin four scroll down and then this will be gold point five this is gonna be gold point five and this would be gold coin six this would equal coin six so that was pretty easy using our backpack in order to copy paste code and the last thing that we have to do is actually uh create the reset button so we had a reset button at the bottom left hand of the screen and this is just to reset the coins so that we can start grabbing all the coins right um and it another thing that this reset button should do is also bring back our score back to zero um so in terms of doing the reset button let's click on the reset button and get the when resabound.click to make sure something happens when we click on the reset button and what do we want to happen uh we want all our coins back to be visible right um just like at the very start we're just resetting the game resetting all the plates and the components so to do that we're going to go to button one and get the setcoin1.visible and what do we want to make it since we're starting over we don't want it to be false right we want it so that it's true so let's go to logic and get the true and that's all we have to do but remember we have six um coins so let's put this into a backup again and then we're going to get uh five more of those four five six and let's change these to the respective coin numbers three four five six good and then this isn't all we have to do actually we still have to set our score to zero right um so just like we set our score dot exe to score dot txt plus one now we just have to set it back to zero so let's go to score and then get the set score.txt2 and then instead of saying plus equals one we wanna say equal to zero so let's just paste that here and then all i have to do is put this inside of the one reset button up click all right cool um so now that we have this uh we have both of our screens our main screen and our screen run code develop so now what we want to do is you can use um an emulator or your phone in order to actually simulate this game i have a emulator called bluestacks on my computer so that's what i'm going to be using in order to demo this um application that we just made so let's get that started so i'm just going to copy paste it onto the screen i'm going to show you guys what we have made so far hopefully you guys were able to get to the end just like i am at cool okay so this is what i have right here um this is just the copy of the game that we just made and then this is the home screen right and when you press start here uh then i reach the player screen where i get to drag my character and my score goes up as i touch the gold coins right you see my score is five but then when i touch the gold coin goes to six right now our coins are all gone and i want to play again so i just have to press my reset then i can start playing again and my score goes up again so that's all for today i hope you all enjoyed watching this tutorial if you guys want to watch tutorials like this be sure to like our videos and subscribe uh that's all i have for today thank you bye
