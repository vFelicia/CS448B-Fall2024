00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:06 - tutorials
00:06 - on scratch roblox minecraft web
00:10 - programming
00:10 - and many more today we're going to
00:12 - create a roller coaster in minecraft so
00:16 - in this project
00:17 - we'll use various tools and redstone to
00:19 - power up our roller coaster
00:21 - so that it will go in the circular path
00:24 - as you can see
00:25 - we also have a hill and a downhill
00:28 - that can allow us to go very fast in the
00:30 - roller coaster
00:32 - okay so let's get started let's start
00:35 - our game
00:36 - by going to minecraft and click on
00:39 - single player
00:40 - in here we'll go on create new world
00:44 - here we can change the name of the new
00:46 - world i'm going to name it roller
00:48 - coaster
00:50 - now let's change the game mode from
00:52 - survival
00:53 - to creative so we can fly and use every
00:57 - item
00:58 - change the difficulty from normal to
01:01 - peaceful
01:03 - and finally go down to more world
01:06 - options
01:08 - world types and select super flat and
01:12 - now we're going to generate a new world
01:13 - and so we can click on create new world
01:19 - all right great so once we upload it
01:21 - into our game let's go to our inventory
01:23 - by pressing e
01:25 - and let's grab some items first item is
01:27 - going to be the oak plank
01:30 - and the second item is going to be the
01:31 - petrified uh slab so we can just go down
01:34 - with it and grab the oak slab
01:37 - next um the other items we can look it
01:40 - up
01:40 - so on the search bar we can look up rail
01:43 - and we can find
01:44 - the power rail which we'll get
01:48 - detector rail which we'll also use and
01:51 - finally
01:51 - the plane rail and the last item
01:55 - we will grab is the redstone torch
01:59 - so we'll grab the restaurant torch so
02:01 - your inventory should have six items
02:05 - so here we can start the roller coaster
02:07 - anywhere we want
02:09 - um here i must start from here
02:12 - and we're going to build a 16 block
02:15 - um with oak plank in a straight line so
02:18 - here i'm gonna go off 16 blocks from
02:20 - here so
02:20 - one two three four five six
02:24 - seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
02:26 - thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
02:29 - awesome and on each side um i'm gonna
02:32 - expand the sides
02:34 - to forty blocks so here starting from
02:36 - here i'm gonna go 40 bucks that way
02:39 - so let's do this real quick
02:54 - awesome and we'll do the same thing on
02:56 - the left side here
02:58 - and so instead of counting i'm just
02:59 - going to keep going until it matches
03:01 - to that side um because how many blocks
03:05 - exactly doesn't really matter as long as
03:07 - the both sides are equal
03:09 - um that is what matters the most so here
03:13 - i'm gonna keep going like i said until
03:16 - i have reached um the same length as
03:20 - what i have done on the other side and
03:23 - here they look like they're the same
03:24 - length like this
03:26 - so here now we should go off 20 blocks
03:29 - on each side
03:31 - so here starting on this edge i'm going
03:33 - off on 20 blocks
03:35 - including this block so one
03:44 - and i'm gonna go ahead and do the same
03:46 - thing on this side
03:56 - and so now you can see this is the
03:58 - bottom part of our
04:00 - tee for the roller coaster and we have
04:02 - to finish
04:03 - wrapping around and making the hill the
04:05 - top of the tee
04:07 - so on each side over here we can add 20
04:10 - blocks
04:11 - so including this we'll add 20 so one
04:21 - and let's go ahead and add that as well
04:24 - on the other side
04:34 - and the final step is to connect that
04:37 - side to here
04:38 - so if you have done it correctly we
04:41 - should just be able to go straight
04:42 - across
04:43 - and this should be perfect
04:47 - and should reach the edge of
04:51 - the other side
04:56 - keep going and yep there it is
04:59 - matches perfectly and now we have
05:03 - our t for the roller coaster
05:06 - let's continue our project by adding the
05:08 - rails to this
05:10 - project here we're going to start with a
05:12 - detector ram over here
05:14 - followed by powered rooms and here we
05:17 - can connect
05:17 - power rails all the way and
05:20 - at the end we can put down three around
05:24 - like this
05:25 - and the reason why we have to use normal
05:27 - rails because
05:28 - um the power rails does not turn a
05:31 - corner
05:32 - so if i put one here it does not turn
05:34 - smoothly for us
05:36 - so we have to use normal rails for the
05:38 - corners
05:40 - and then we can keep using uh power
05:42 - rails
05:43 - however we feel like and we can actually
05:45 - add um
05:47 - somewhere else in between and then
05:49 - finish it off with some
05:51 - power rails so according to you know
05:54 - um how fast you want the overall
05:57 - uh trip go you can add more
06:00 - um powered rooms it will make your
06:03 - minecart go a lot faster um the more
06:06 - consecutive
06:07 - powered rails you have here i'm just
06:10 - trying to make it so we can go all the
06:11 - way around without ever stopping
06:13 - so i'll add
06:16 - around 10 to 20 rows of
06:20 - um power drills and then followed by
06:22 - normal rails
06:24 - so here i'm just doing some maybe 5 to
06:27 - 10
06:28 - just normal rails followed by 10 to 20
06:31 - uh power drills
06:34 - and again make sure the corners are just
06:37 - normal
06:38 - and we're actually going to stop in this
06:40 - corner and that corner because we'll be
06:41 - making the hills over here so we don't
06:43 - have to fill out the rails yet
06:45 - over here let's go back to our start and
06:48 - um
06:48 - finish off the edge on this side
06:51 - you know we have some normal rails
06:53 - followed by power grips again
06:56 - and again um the amount of power rails
06:59 - um is completely personal you can add
07:02 - however
07:04 - many you see fit and again the more you
07:07 - put
07:08 - the faster your minecraft will go and
07:11 - the quicker you will get
07:12 - um around the circle and around the
07:14 - whole trip
07:18 - again just make sure that you don't put
07:20 - any power rails or even detector rails
07:23 - on the edge
07:24 - um on the corner because otherwise your
07:26 - minecart would not be able to turn
07:29 - so i'll use the normal rails and corners
07:41 - all right cool and so before we actually
07:45 - finish
07:46 - the project by doing the hills let's
07:48 - power these uh
07:49 - rails that we have here with our
07:52 - um restaurant torch and the slabs
07:56 - so whenever you're near um
07:59 - these power rails you can put a slab on
08:02 - the side
08:03 - and a torch right on it and you can see
08:06 - that
08:06 - the power rails will be powered when
08:08 - they turn red like this
08:09 - so you can see that these are unpowered
08:11 - so these are very dark red
08:14 - well these are powered so they have the
08:15 - same red as you know the restroom torch
08:18 - and you can also see the range of this
08:20 - so this is the last range
08:22 - uh last rail that is reached by this
08:25 - torch
08:26 - so these two are unpowered still um
08:30 - so let's just shift this center this i
08:33 - like to call battery
08:34 - um to the middle so that it will reach
08:36 - more and as you can see
08:38 - um you'll reach all the way to the end
08:41 - on the left
08:42 - and as well as all the way to the right
08:45 - which is perfect and pretty much around
08:49 - um the whole thing you want to do this
08:51 - so um
08:52 - you can go to the basically the middle
08:55 - of the power rails and add the torch
08:58 - so go to the middle of a section of
09:02 - power rails
09:03 - put down the slab and put on the torch
09:06 - and here
09:07 - this is actually a very long
09:10 - sequence of rails so i'm gonna add two
09:12 - torches and it's fine if you need to add
09:14 - two torches
09:16 - um as long as you make sure that all of
09:18 - them are powered
09:19 - um this should work so again
09:22 - um and to be safe i'm just gonna add
09:28 - two torches on this one as well
09:32 - and again i'm gonna try to put it in the
09:34 - middle trying to reach
09:36 - all of them and if all of them are
09:39 - shining um it doesn't matter how far
09:42 - they are from the restaurant torch if
09:43 - they're powered um they will have the
09:45 - same power
09:46 - so don't have to worry about one of them
09:48 - getting less power than the other
09:49 - because they're further
09:51 - so here we can go over here and
09:55 - see what we did as
10:02 - previously
10:12 - restaurant torch can have a power of
10:15 - eight blocks so if
10:17 - the torture place um has a range of
10:20 - eight blocks
10:21 - left and eight blocks to the right for a
10:23 - total of uh
10:24 - 17 blocks including the middle block so
10:27 - you have pretty much eight blocks on
10:30 - that side and eight blocks on this side
10:31 - to power
10:32 - and that's how you can actually
10:33 - calculate if you have enough room as
10:35 - well
10:37 - but yeah this is what we have so far and
10:40 - let's
10:41 - finish our project by uh making the hill
10:45 - so let's go on the top of t to make our
10:48 - heels here i'm gonna count from the side
10:52 - the most edge of the block and i'm gonna
10:54 - count three blocks in so i have one
10:57 - two three and here on the
11:00 - fourth block uh after three empty blocks
11:02 - i'm gonna put down the block and
11:03 - make this two block wide like this
11:07 - so this is our first step next i'm gonna
11:10 - add
11:11 - two more blocks like this creating kind
11:14 - of a staircase
11:15 - layout here i have one step and two
11:17 - steps and this is my second layer
11:20 - and then we'll make ten more or ten
11:23 - total layers in total
11:24 - um so eight more layers so one two
11:41 - that so there's 10 blocks like this
11:44 - um with a total of 20 blocks
11:47 - so here we have one two three four
11:51 - five six seven eight nine
11:54 - ten so we have gone up 10 blocks and
11:56 - let's do that
11:58 - um the same thing on this side so let's
12:00 - count off three blocks so one
12:02 - two three and then fourth at this two
12:05 - block white
12:06 - staircase and then
12:18 - and now let's connect the uh top
12:21 - platform together
12:23 - and if you did it correctly they should
12:26 - both be the same height on each side so
12:28 - you can just run across and they should
12:30 - connect perfectly
12:32 - and here um for the staircase um we want
12:36 - to add
12:36 - all power rails because it's very hard
12:38 - to go uphill
12:40 - um so here we're going to add our power
12:42 - rails
12:45 - and then in between we can add all rails
12:50 - again here you can change it up if you
12:52 - want um
12:53 - for us we're just gonna make it so the
12:55 - user have to go across the bridge
12:57 - um pretty much across the hill by
12:59 - himself
13:00 - uh if you guys do not want to do that
13:02 - you can definitely add some power rails
13:04 - in between here
13:06 - just to make sure um to power it with a
13:09 - slab
13:09 - and a restaurant torch on it
13:13 - so here i'm gonna have power rails again
13:17 - going down and
13:21 - all right and to power this we'll be
13:24 - doing the same thing as over here
13:26 - so on any of these blocks um that are
13:29 - actually hosting the railroad so
13:31 - not these black uh back ones just put
13:34 - down
13:35 - a slab on these and put a torch down
13:38 - and as you can see they're powered again
13:41 - and you can see the range
13:42 - um these are already powered um so
13:45 - adding this will not actually do
13:47 - anything
13:49 - so we don't have to add that actually so
13:51 - let's go on here
13:53 - and um add
13:56 - some torch as well and you know i'm
13:59 - actually gonna add um
14:02 - some power rows here just so i don't
14:05 - have to um
14:07 - you know press w the whole time you get
14:09 - across
14:10 - because when there's no power um and
14:12 - you're on rails you can actually move
14:15 - the card forward
14:16 - by pressing w um however it is very slow
14:19 - and
14:20 - try not be too fond of a roller coaster
14:23 - ride for people
14:26 - all right so here we actually have the
14:28 - whole course for the roller coaster done
14:32 - and to finish a project we can actually
14:35 - take away all of these items as we don't
14:37 - need them anymore
14:38 - now we can look up our carts so we can
14:41 - look up cards
14:42 - pick up our first my card as well as
14:46 - pick up some
14:46 - fences so let's type in fence and let's
14:48 - type in oak fence
14:50 - and before i go on my joyride i'm gonna
14:53 - have
14:54 - fences one block apart from the trail
14:59 - one block apart like this so that you
15:01 - know it prevents
15:03 - uh safety progressions people can't get
15:05 - into the roller coaster while it's
15:07 - happening
15:08 - and um yeah you just keep
15:12 - uh the mobs away as well so they can't
15:14 - touch with our
15:16 - uh our cool roller coaster so here
15:35 - all right and so now as you can see i've
15:37 - surrounded the whole game and hold a
15:39 - roller coaster with fences
15:42 - and here i'm going to look up uh fence
15:44 - gates so here we can just replace
15:46 - one of these with a gate now we can
15:49 - open and go in next put
15:52 - a minecart down enter it
15:56 - by right-clicking and then press w in
15:58 - one of the direction
15:59 - and you should start to uh
16:03 - be able to go around without pressing
16:05 - any buttons so here
16:06 - my hands are off the keyboard and i am
16:10 - just enjoying this
16:11 - fun rollercoaster ride that i have made
16:13 - for myself
16:19 - all of these trails of these rails
16:21 - should be powered
16:23 - um that's also very important because
16:25 - non-power rails will actually stop the
16:27 - dead in the track um
16:28 - so you actually instantly stop as soon
16:31 - as you get
16:33 - to an unpowered rail so that's all for
16:36 - today
16:36 - in today's project we learned how to
16:38 - make a roller coaster ride
16:40 - in minecraft using oak wood planks
16:43 - upward slabs power rails detector rails
16:47 - normal rails and minecraft redstone
16:50 - torch
16:50 - we also learned some design techniques
16:52 - to create an elevated track
16:55 - i hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to
16:57 - subscribe to our channel and like our
16:59 - videos
17:00 - also don't forget to check out our other
17:01 - two videos here while you wait for other
17:03 - next videos
17:05 - thank you and bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a roller coaster in minecraft so in this project we'll use various tools and redstone to power up our roller coaster so that it will go in the circular path as you can see we also have a hill and a downhill that can allow us to go very fast in the roller coaster okay so let's get started let's start our game by going to minecraft and click on single player in here we'll go on create new world here we can change the name of the new world i'm going to name it roller coaster now let's change the game mode from survival to creative so we can fly and use every item change the difficulty from normal to peaceful and finally go down to more world options world types and select super flat and now we're going to generate a new world and so we can click on create new world all right great so once we upload it into our game let's go to our inventory by pressing e and let's grab some items first item is going to be the oak plank and the second item is going to be the petrified uh slab so we can just go down with it and grab the oak slab next um the other items we can look it up so on the search bar we can look up rail and we can find the power rail which we'll get detector rail which we'll also use and finally the plane rail and the last item we will grab is the redstone torch so we'll grab the restaurant torch so your inventory should have six items so here we can start the roller coaster anywhere we want um here i must start from here and we're going to build a 16 block um with oak plank in a straight line so here i'm gonna go off 16 blocks from here so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen awesome and on each side um i'm gonna expand the sides to forty blocks so here starting from here i'm gonna go 40 bucks that way so let's do this real quick awesome and we'll do the same thing on the left side here and so instead of counting i'm just going to keep going until it matches to that side um because how many blocks exactly doesn't really matter as long as the both sides are equal um that is what matters the most so here i'm gonna keep going like i said until i have reached um the same length as what i have done on the other side and here they look like they're the same length like this so here now we should go off 20 blocks on each side so here starting on this edge i'm going off on 20 blocks including this block so one and i'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing on this side and so now you can see this is the bottom part of our tee for the roller coaster and we have to finish wrapping around and making the hill the top of the tee so on each side over here we can add 20 blocks so including this we'll add 20 so one and let's go ahead and add that as well on the other side and the final step is to connect that side to here so if you have done it correctly we should just be able to go straight across and this should be perfect and should reach the edge of the other side keep going and yep there it is matches perfectly and now we have our t for the roller coaster let's continue our project by adding the rails to this project here we're going to start with a detector ram over here followed by powered rooms and here we can connect power rails all the way and at the end we can put down three around like this and the reason why we have to use normal rails because um the power rails does not turn a corner so if i put one here it does not turn smoothly for us so we have to use normal rails for the corners and then we can keep using uh power rails however we feel like and we can actually add um somewhere else in between and then finish it off with some power rails so according to you know um how fast you want the overall uh trip go you can add more um powered rooms it will make your minecart go a lot faster um the more consecutive powered rails you have here i'm just trying to make it so we can go all the way around without ever stopping so i'll add around 10 to 20 rows of um power drills and then followed by normal rails so here i'm just doing some maybe 5 to 10 just normal rails followed by 10 to 20 uh power drills and again make sure the corners are just normal and we're actually going to stop in this corner and that corner because we'll be making the hills over here so we don't have to fill out the rails yet over here let's go back to our start and um finish off the edge on this side you know we have some normal rails followed by power grips again and again um the amount of power rails um is completely personal you can add however many you see fit and again the more you put the faster your minecraft will go and the quicker you will get um around the circle and around the whole trip again just make sure that you don't put any power rails or even detector rails on the edge um on the corner because otherwise your minecart would not be able to turn so i'll use the normal rails and corners all right cool and so before we actually finish the project by doing the hills let's power these uh rails that we have here with our um restaurant torch and the slabs so whenever you're near um these power rails you can put a slab on the side and a torch right on it and you can see that the power rails will be powered when they turn red like this so you can see that these are unpowered so these are very dark red well these are powered so they have the same red as you know the restroom torch and you can also see the range of this so this is the last range uh last rail that is reached by this torch so these two are unpowered still um so let's just shift this center this i like to call battery um to the middle so that it will reach more and as you can see um you'll reach all the way to the end on the left and as well as all the way to the right which is perfect and pretty much around um the whole thing you want to do this so um you can go to the basically the middle of the power rails and add the torch so go to the middle of a section of power rails put down the slab and put on the torch and here this is actually a very long sequence of rails so i'm gonna add two torches and it's fine if you need to add two torches um as long as you make sure that all of them are powered um this should work so again um and to be safe i'm just gonna add two torches on this one as well and again i'm gonna try to put it in the middle trying to reach all of them and if all of them are shining um it doesn't matter how far they are from the restaurant torch if they're powered um they will have the same power so don't have to worry about one of them getting less power than the other because they're further so here we can go over here and see what we did as previously restaurant torch can have a power of eight blocks so if the torture place um has a range of eight blocks left and eight blocks to the right for a total of uh 17 blocks including the middle block so you have pretty much eight blocks on that side and eight blocks on this side to power and that's how you can actually calculate if you have enough room as well but yeah this is what we have so far and let's finish our project by uh making the hill so let's go on the top of t to make our heels here i'm gonna count from the side the most edge of the block and i'm gonna count three blocks in so i have one two three and here on the fourth block uh after three empty blocks i'm gonna put down the block and make this two block wide like this so this is our first step next i'm gonna add two more blocks like this creating kind of a staircase layout here i have one step and two steps and this is my second layer and then we'll make ten more or ten total layers in total um so eight more layers so one two that so there's 10 blocks like this um with a total of 20 blocks so here we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so we have gone up 10 blocks and let's do that um the same thing on this side so let's count off three blocks so one two three and then fourth at this two block white staircase and then and now let's connect the uh top platform together and if you did it correctly they should both be the same height on each side so you can just run across and they should connect perfectly and here um for the staircase um we want to add all power rails because it's very hard to go uphill um so here we're going to add our power rails and then in between we can add all rails again here you can change it up if you want um for us we're just gonna make it so the user have to go across the bridge um pretty much across the hill by himself uh if you guys do not want to do that you can definitely add some power rails in between here just to make sure um to power it with a slab and a restaurant torch on it so here i'm gonna have power rails again going down and all right and to power this we'll be doing the same thing as over here so on any of these blocks um that are actually hosting the railroad so not these black uh back ones just put down a slab on these and put a torch down and as you can see they're powered again and you can see the range um these are already powered um so adding this will not actually do anything so we don't have to add that actually so let's go on here and um add some torch as well and you know i'm actually gonna add um some power rows here just so i don't have to um you know press w the whole time you get across because when there's no power um and you're on rails you can actually move the card forward by pressing w um however it is very slow and try not be too fond of a roller coaster ride for people all right so here we actually have the whole course for the roller coaster done and to finish a project we can actually take away all of these items as we don't need them anymore now we can look up our carts so we can look up cards pick up our first my card as well as pick up some fences so let's type in fence and let's type in oak fence and before i go on my joyride i'm gonna have fences one block apart from the trail one block apart like this so that you know it prevents uh safety progressions people can't get into the roller coaster while it's happening and um yeah you just keep uh the mobs away as well so they can't touch with our uh our cool roller coaster so here all right and so now as you can see i've surrounded the whole game and hold a roller coaster with fences and here i'm going to look up uh fence gates so here we can just replace one of these with a gate now we can open and go in next put a minecart down enter it by rightclicking and then press w in one of the direction and you should start to uh be able to go around without pressing any buttons so here my hands are off the keyboard and i am just enjoying this fun rollercoaster ride that i have made for myself all of these trails of these rails should be powered um that's also very important because nonpower rails will actually stop the dead in the track um so you actually instantly stop as soon as you get to an unpowered rail so that's all for today in today's project we learned how to make a roller coaster ride in minecraft using oak wood planks upward slabs power rails detector rails normal rails and minecraft redstone torch we also learned some design techniques to create an elevated track i hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe to our channel and
