00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginning friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we're going to create a scratch
00:14 - band
00:15 - so in this project i'll teach you how to
00:17 - make a scratch interactional game
00:19 - that is related to the camera for this
00:21 - project
00:22 - the user will have to turn on the camera
00:24 - and move around to play the instrument
00:27 - we will also play a clip showing you how
00:29 - to use your camera to play the
00:34 - [Music]
00:42 - instruments
00:46 - so we'll start this project by creating
00:48 - a new project
00:49 - in scratch so go ahead and go to
00:52 - scratch.mit.edu and log in using your
00:54 - accounts
00:55 - and afterward let's go over to the top
00:57 - left and click on create
00:59 - to make a new project
01:02 - afterward let's rename this new project
01:04 - in
01:05 - the top to live bang
01:09 - and let's also remove our sprite 1 which
01:11 - is the cat
01:13 - and in this project we're not going to
01:14 - use any backdrops
01:16 - so the plain white black drop will do
01:19 - instead we'll be
01:20 - including an extension so go ahead and
01:23 - go to the bottom left here
01:25 - and click on this little blue button
01:28 - and this will open up all the extensions
01:30 - that we can have
01:31 - that's offered from scratch the one
01:33 - we're trying to select
01:34 - is video sensing so sense motion with
01:37 - the camera
01:38 - so we're going to click here and now as
01:41 - you see on the left
01:42 - for blocks we have added a new section
01:45 - called video sensing
01:47 - now let's add the sprites in this
01:49 - project i will need force right
01:51 - i will need a saxophone a drum
01:54 - a guitar and a keyboard so all four of
01:58 - these sprites could be found
02:00 - in the sprite library
02:03 - so instead of uploading a sprite i would
02:06 - just be using the default sprites that
02:08 - is offered in sprite
02:09 - uh in scratch and um so to find the four
02:14 - sprites let's go over here to choose
02:15 - your sprites
02:17 - so the first one i'm gonna look up is
02:18 - saxophone so look up
02:20 - saxophone there it is
02:24 - and let's look up the other ones second
02:27 - one i'm gonna look up is drum
02:29 - so i can look up drum and i'm gonna get
02:31 - the drum kit
02:32 - over here next
02:36 - let's grab the guitar so here i'm gonna
02:38 - look up guitar
02:40 - and i'm gonna grab the the guitar
02:45 - and then finally we will want a keyboard
02:48 - so here let's look up keyboard
02:50 - and now they're showing one option it's
02:52 - awesome
02:54 - now i'm going to spread out the sprites
02:57 - um i want my guitar to be in the bottom
02:59 - left
03:00 - my uh my keyboard to be on the top left
03:04 - my saxophone to be on the top right and
03:07 - my drum kit to be on the bottom right
03:09 - um and it's important to spread these
03:11 - out so that the
03:13 - camera sensing or the video sensing
03:15 - would not
03:16 - overlap and um each motion will only
03:19 - indicate
03:20 - uh one of the instruments to play
03:23 - next for each of these um sprites
03:27 - i want to assign a sound to the sprite
03:30 - so that's
03:30 - when the video camera senses movement
03:33 - for that specific sprite it will place
03:35 - the sound
03:36 - so let's go over here to sounds
03:40 - and um here we see that there's a lot of
03:43 - sound we can pick from um
03:46 - so for each one we will only need one of
03:48 - them
03:49 - and so since there's so many default
03:52 - sounds that are
03:53 - included with the sprite instead of
03:55 - picking one that we want from the
03:57 - library we can just pick one from here
03:59 - um and it's important that you can
04:03 - play it through to see what it really
04:04 - sound like and then pick the one that
04:06 - you like and then
04:08 - um we can kind of keep track of the name
04:10 - and then use that name
04:12 - for the call so here i think katar
04:15 - uh with the c guitar is nice
04:19 - and with the keyboard i think the uh c2
04:22 - electric
04:23 - piano is nice with the drum kit
04:26 - i do believe that drum bass two um is
04:29 - the
04:30 - best one and for the saxophone i'll be
04:33 - using
04:34 - the g um stacks over here
04:38 - so these are the four sounds i have
04:39 - selected inside of our sounds
04:41 - and again you can pick any sound you
04:43 - want or even import a new sound
04:47 - so once we have designed our band scene
04:50 - over here with the four corners it's
04:52 - time to do
04:53 - the coding parts here we want the
04:56 - following behaviors with our sprites
04:58 - we want the sprites to be able to detect
05:01 - whether something is moving behind them
05:03 - via the video sensing and it will play a
05:07 - sound
05:08 - when it does detect that and you also
05:10 - play the sound at the
05:11 - sign sounds that we have uh decided to
05:14 - play
05:16 - so yeah let's start by
05:19 - coding our saxophone let's grab
05:22 - from event when green flag is click
05:27 - and when the green flag is clicked we
05:29 - want to turn on the camera
05:31 - and enable the video sensing so here
05:34 - we'll go over here
05:35 - to video sensing and grab turn video on
05:39 - block and we'll keep it as uh on
05:44 - so now whenever we press the green
05:45 - button um it will start to sense
05:48 - um motion using our camera
05:52 - next um also still within the saxophone
05:55 - code
05:56 - let's go ahead and grab another when
05:58 - green flag is clicked
06:00 - and now we want to grab a forever loop
06:03 - so go over to control
06:06 - forever here what we want to say
06:10 - is inside of this forever loop we want
06:12 - to check
06:13 - if the video sensing has detected
06:16 - something
06:17 - that is behind the saxophone in this
06:19 - case we want to play the dedicated sound
06:22 - so let's go over to
06:25 - control again and grab the if block
06:29 - so the if and then block and inside it's
06:33 - here we want to find
06:35 - um or we want to detect when the user
06:39 - has
06:39 - moved um behind the saxophone via his
06:42 - camera
06:43 - so here we can use an operator and let's
06:47 - grab the lesson operator
06:51 - okay i'm sorry so let's grab the greater
06:53 - than operator
06:54 - which is just the first one here and put
06:57 - it inside of our
06:58 - conditional and here on the left side
07:02 - we want to grab some block from video
07:05 - sensing so go over here to video sensing
07:08 - and the one we want to grab is the video
07:11 - motion on sprite
07:13 - so let's grab that and put it on the
07:16 - left side
07:17 - of the conditional and
07:20 - here instead of 50 we'll change it to
07:22 - 40.
07:24 - and when this happens that means we have
07:27 - crossed over
07:28 - behind the saxophone and the sound
07:30 - should be played
07:32 - and here let's go to sound and uh
07:35 - start sound and remember we have
07:38 - selected
07:39 - tree uh the g sec so here i'm gonna
07:42 - select gsax
07:44 - and that would be the code for our
07:47 - saxophone
07:48 - all right so um we'll be doing the same
07:50 - thing for the next three sprites
07:52 - um with this block over here so let's
07:56 - do that so here for the drum kit
08:00 - i will once again grab the when green
08:02 - flag is clicked
08:04 - and go over to control and grab the
08:06 - forever
08:07 - loop here again i'll grab the if
08:11 - statements
08:12 - and inside the if statements i'll grab
08:14 - the greater than conditional
08:18 - and once again on the left side of the
08:20 - conditional i want to go over
08:22 - to video sensing and grab video motion
08:25 - on sprites
08:28 - and the slight difference between these
08:30 - three sprites and the saxophone
08:32 - is that in the conditional instead of 40
08:35 - we're gonna type
08:35 - 30.
08:38 - and then once again we'll play the sound
08:41 - that we have decided to play for that
08:43 - specific
08:43 - uh instrument so for the drum um
08:47 - the drum bass two is what we have
08:48 - decided on
08:51 - so yep this would be the complete code
08:53 - for our drum kit
08:56 - moving on to guitar we'll be doing
08:57 - something very very similar so here we
09:00 - grab
09:01 - when green flag is clicked again we can
09:04 - grab the forever loop
09:06 - and uh grab the if statements
09:09 - inside the if statements we'll once
09:11 - again be using the greater than
09:12 - conditional and the left side of the
09:15 - conditional should be
09:16 - video motion on sprites
09:19 - and again we'll change this to 30
09:23 - and for sound we can say play sound
09:26 - or start sound and here
09:31 - i kind of decided that maybe
09:35 - the c katori is the best
09:38 - um in this case it doesn't really matter
09:40 - um again you can pick any sound you like
09:42 - so
09:43 - i'm just showing you an example of a
09:45 - sound
09:47 - so let's finish this project by
09:49 - completing our keyboard
09:51 - so again the keyboard will have the same
09:53 - instructions we have when
09:55 - green flag is clicked and then we enter
09:58 - this infinite loop
09:59 - or forever loop in the forever loop we
10:02 - will check
10:02 - for one condition and the condition is
10:06 - going to have an operating system
10:08 - and the condition is going to have an
10:10 - operator a conditional which is secured
10:12 - event
10:15 - operations and again on the left side we
10:17 - will grab
10:18 - the video sensing uh video motion of
10:21 - sprites
10:22 - and on the right we'll change 50 to 30
10:25 - and inside the loop we'll write uh
10:29 - play sound or start sound and here again
10:32 - you can pick the sound that you like
10:34 - um but um c2 electric piano
10:39 - is my choice and yeah so now we have
10:43 - actually
10:44 - completed the project um go ahead and
10:46 - press the green button
10:48 - and uh experiment with the instrument
10:51 - and the live band so that's all for
10:53 - today hope you guys

hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginning friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a scratch band so in this project i'll teach you how to make a scratch interactional game that is related to the camera for this project the user will have to turn on the camera and move around to play the instrument we will also play a clip showing you how to use your camera to play the instruments so we'll start this project by creating a new project in scratch so go ahead and go to scratch.mit.edu and log in using your accounts and afterward let's go over to the top left and click on create to make a new project afterward let's rename this new project in the top to live bang and let's also remove our sprite 1 which is the cat and in this project we're not going to use any backdrops so the plain white black drop will do instead we'll be including an extension so go ahead and go to the bottom left here and click on this little blue button and this will open up all the extensions that we can have that's offered from scratch the one we're trying to select is video sensing so sense motion with the camera so we're going to click here and now as you see on the left for blocks we have added a new section called video sensing now let's add the sprites in this project i will need force right i will need a saxophone a drum a guitar and a keyboard so all four of these sprites could be found in the sprite library so instead of uploading a sprite i would just be using the default sprites that is offered in sprite uh in scratch and um so to find the four sprites let's go over here to choose your sprites so the first one i'm gonna look up is saxophone so look up saxophone there it is and let's look up the other ones second one i'm gonna look up is drum so i can look up drum and i'm gonna get the drum kit over here next let's grab the guitar so here i'm gonna look up guitar and i'm gonna grab the the guitar and then finally we will want a keyboard so here let's look up keyboard and now they're showing one option it's awesome now i'm going to spread out the sprites um i want my guitar to be in the bottom left my uh my keyboard to be on the top left my saxophone to be on the top right and my drum kit to be on the bottom right um and it's important to spread these out so that the camera sensing or the video sensing would not overlap and um each motion will only indicate uh one of the instruments to play next for each of these um sprites i want to assign a sound to the sprite so that's when the video camera senses movement for that specific sprite it will place the sound so let's go over here to sounds and um here we see that there's a lot of sound we can pick from um so for each one we will only need one of them and so since there's so many default sounds that are included with the sprite instead of picking one that we want from the library we can just pick one from here um and it's important that you can play it through to see what it really sound like and then pick the one that you like and then um we can kind of keep track of the name and then use that name for the call so here i think katar uh with the c guitar is nice and with the keyboard i think the uh c2 electric piano is nice with the drum kit i do believe that drum bass two um is the best one and for the saxophone i'll be using the g um stacks over here so these are the four sounds i have selected inside of our sounds and again you can pick any sound you want or even import a new sound so once we have designed our band scene over here with the four corners it's time to do the coding parts here we want the following behaviors with our sprites we want the sprites to be able to detect whether something is moving behind them via the video sensing and it will play a sound when it does detect that and you also play the sound at the sign sounds that we have uh decided to play so yeah let's start by coding our saxophone let's grab from event when green flag is click and when the green flag is clicked we want to turn on the camera and enable the video sensing so here we'll go over here to video sensing and grab turn video on block and we'll keep it as uh on so now whenever we press the green button um it will start to sense um motion using our camera next um also still within the saxophone code let's go ahead and grab another when green flag is clicked and now we want to grab a forever loop so go over to control forever here what we want to say is inside of this forever loop we want to check if the video sensing has detected something that is behind the saxophone in this case we want to play the dedicated sound so let's go over to control again and grab the if block so the if and then block and inside it's here we want to find um or we want to detect when the user has moved um behind the saxophone via his camera so here we can use an operator and let's grab the lesson operator okay i'm sorry so let's grab the greater than operator which is just the first one here and put it inside of our conditional and here on the left side we want to grab some block from

change it to 40. and when this happens that means we have crossed over behind the saxophone and the sound should be played and here let's go to sound and uh start sound and remember we have selected tree uh the g sec so here i'm gonna select gsax and that would be the code for our saxophone all right so um we'll be doing the same thing for the next three sprites um with this block over here so let's do that so here for the drum kit i will once again grab the when green flag is clicked and go over to control and grab the forever loop here again i'll grab the if statements and inside the if statements i'll grab the greater than conditional and once again on the left side of the conditional i want to go over to video sensing and grab video motion on sprites and the slight difference between these three sprites and the saxophone is that in the conditional instead of 40 we're gonna type 30. and then once again we'll play the sound that we have decided to play for that specific uh instrument so for the drum um the drum bass two is what we have decided on so yep this would be the complete code for our drum kit moving on to guitar we'll be doing something very very similar so here we grab when green flag is clicked again we can grab the forever loop and uh grab the if statements inside the if statements we'll once again be using the greater than conditional and the left side of the conditional should be video motion on sprites and again we'll change this to 30 and for sound we can say play sound or start sound and here i kind of decided that maybe the c katori is the best um in this case it doesn't really matter um again you can pick any sound you like so i'm just showing you an example of a sound so let's finish this project by completing our keyboard so again the keyboard will have the same instructions we have when green flag is clicked and then we enter this infinite loop or forever loop in the forever loop we will check for one condition and the condition is going to have an operating system and the condition is going to have an operator a conditional which is secured event operations and again on the left side we will grab the video sensing uh video motion of sprites and on the right we'll change 50 to 30 and inside the loop we'll write uh play sound or start sound and here again you can pick the sound that you like um but um c2 electric piano is my choice and yeah so now we have actually completed the project um go ahead and press the green button and uh experiment with the instrument and the live band so that's all for today hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like our videos also check out our other two videos here while you wait for our next video thank you and bye bye
