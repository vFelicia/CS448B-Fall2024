00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel here we share beginner friendly
00:04 - tutorial videos on scratch roblox
00:07 - minecraft web programming and many more
00:09 - and today we're going to create a roblox
00:12 - treasure hunt game
00:14 - so in this project we will be creating a
00:16 - roblox treasure hunt game called red
00:18 - envelope hunt quest
00:20 - and the idea of the project is that the
00:22 - players have to find 10 rep
00:24 - envelopes within 5 minutes and these red
00:27 - envelopes are hidden inside the
00:28 - buildings that we're going to
00:30 - add to our game and this tutorial is in
00:33 - two parts the first part of the tutorial
00:35 - would be game scene design
00:37 - in which i will teach you how to create
00:38 - the game using roblox studio
00:41 - and in the second part i'll be teaching
00:43 - you how to code the project using code
00:45 - kingdoms
00:45 - so let's get started
00:49 - all right so let's go ahead and create
00:51 - our game scene so first i'm going to
00:53 - code
00:54 - kingdoms to create a custom project and
00:57 - i'm going to rename the project
00:59 - as red envelope
01:04 - quest and i am also going to select it
01:07 - as a base plate
01:08 - all right and we can go ahead and click
01:10 - start
01:12 - okay then i'm going to go ahead
01:15 - and add a new file called red envelope
01:18 - which is an
01:19 - object and i'm going to add it as a
01:21 - local behavior
01:22 - all right so add red envelope
01:27 - okay object and local behavior
01:30 - and go ahead and add it
01:33 - then all right after we have created our
01:36 - project we want to
01:37 - download it and open it in roblox studio
01:43 - all right okay now that we have the
01:45 - project downloaded into roblox studio
01:48 - the next thing we want to do is we want
01:49 - to create a ground so we want to choose
01:52 - part right here okay and we want
01:56 - to change the material to be concrete
02:00 - all right concrete and we want to change
02:03 - the color to either black or gray
02:05 - to give sort of the natural effect of a
02:08 - road
02:09 - and then we're going to stretch it using
02:10 - the scale tool right here
02:12 - okay to make it cover the base plate and
02:15 - then we also want to anchor it
02:17 - okay so i'm going to scale it right now
02:56 - all right now the next thing i'm going
02:58 - to do is i'm going to use the toolbox
03:00 - function right here
03:01 - all right to add buildings into my city
03:04 - now you can choose any buildings that
03:06 - you like but make sure that you can open
03:08 - them and go inside as some
03:10 - model buildings are you can find in the
03:13 - toolbox do not allow your characters to
03:15 - go inside
03:16 - all right
03:21 - so i'm gonna go ahead and add in a
03:23 - coffee shop
03:30 - okay and then i'm gonna go ahead and add
03:33 - it right here
03:35 - okay and i also want to rotate it
03:39 - like so okay and then i'm gonna go ahead
03:42 - and add in a domino's pizza okay so
03:46 - domino's pizza
04:00 - all right so i have my domino's pizza
04:02 - right here i will put it
04:04 - in front of the coffee shop
04:08 - all right and then i want to go ahead
04:11 - and add a bakery as well
04:14 - so i'm gonna switch that up right here
04:22 - okay all right let me place it
04:26 - right next to the coffee shop
04:29 - okay
04:33 - and then i'm going to add in a library
04:43 - okay let's place that
04:49 - okay right next to the bakery
04:52 - let's go ahead and also rotate it
05:00 - alright then i want to go and add a shop
05:14 - all right and the last thing i'm going
05:15 - to add after the shop
05:17 - is a shopping center i'm going to go
05:20 - ahead and add this one right here
05:24 - okay and we'll place it in the space we
05:27 - have
05:28 - around there okay
05:31 - now the next thing we want to do is we
05:33 - want to add a spawn location in the
05:35 - middle of the city so that we can
05:37 - easily access or move around okay so
05:40 - we'll get a spawning point
05:48 - okay and we want to place it in the
05:50 - middle
05:52 - of the city sits right around there
05:56 - okay all right now that we have the
05:59 - spawn place
06:00 - okay we will be making the red envelopes
06:02 - or your treasures
06:04 - so what we want to do is we want to
06:06 - choose part okay so let's close up the
06:08 - toolbox
06:09 - we want to choose part a right there
06:19 - and we want to go ahead and change the
06:21 - material to the plastic
06:24 - all right and the color to red
06:28 - okay right here and we're going to read
06:31 - rename this part as red
06:33 - envelope okay and in this part we also
06:36 - want to add some sparkles
06:38 - so first of all let's go ahead and
06:40 - rename them
06:42 - okay rename them
06:47 - to red envelope
06:54 - all right then let's add some sparkle
06:58 - all right so let's sparkle
07:01 - okay and just click on that and then we
07:03 - have it
07:04 - okay so now we're going to create 10 of
07:07 - these envelopes so we need to
07:08 - duplicate them and we can use this
07:11 - component right here to duplicate it
07:14 - all right so we'll go ahead duplicate
07:19 - duplicate until we have 10 of them
07:23 - all right so i'm at my 10th one so right
07:25 - click duplicate
07:26 - now we have 10 of them right so if we
07:29 - move them out we have
07:30 - three four
07:32 - [Music]
07:34 - five six seven
07:37 - eight nine and ten
07:40 - okay all right now the next thing we
07:43 - want to do is
07:44 - by using the move tool okay in our home
07:47 - we can place the red envelopes inside
07:49 - the buildings now we can make them
07:50 - difficult to find by placing them
07:52 - in places which are hard to find like
07:54 - under a chair
07:55 - or in a faraway room okay and some
07:59 - buildings can also have one envelope or
08:01 - two envelopes and some will have even
08:03 - more
08:03 - all right let's go ahead and do that
08:53 - all right i've hidden all my 10
08:54 - envelopes for example
08:56 - i have hidden one here in the library in
08:58 - the second floor
09:00 - so the players would have to climb up
09:02 - this stair right here to be able to
09:03 - reach it
09:05 - okay so now we are going to create the
09:08 - time
09:09 - so to do that we need to create a
09:10 - countdown timer
09:12 - and we're going to add a screen gui gui
09:14 - stands for
09:15 - graphical user interface and it's used
09:17 - to display information
09:19 - about the game such as time in this case
09:21 - to the player
09:22 - okay so the way to do that is we go to
09:24 - view click on explorer
09:27 - all right and we want to scroll down and
09:29 - find screen gui
09:31 - i have one right here let me delete it
09:32 - first yeah we want to find
09:35 - our starter gui sorry and we want to
09:38 - click on this plus sign
09:39 - and insert screen gui all right
09:43 - now we want to click on screen gui and
09:45 - then
09:46 - click this plus sign and add in a text
09:49 - label
09:50 - all right so it's right here now to make
09:53 - this text label
09:54 - bigger we can click right and then it's
09:57 - going to highlight
09:58 - the text label component all right and
10:01 - we can go to view
10:03 - and open properties and in the
10:05 - properties we're going to scroll down to
10:07 - the text
10:09 - section okay right here
10:12 - and in the text part okay so first of
10:14 - all let's change the text inside
10:17 - we'll make it count down
10:20 - timer okay and this part
10:24 - next part is we're going to increase the
10:25 - text size so we can put in 30 for
10:30 - example
10:32 - right so after we put in 30 now you can
10:33 - see our countdown timer
10:35 - the text is much bigger now the next
10:38 - thing we want to do is we want to go
10:39 - back to our text label so i'm just going
10:41 - to
10:41 - close that all right and we want to
10:43 - insert a script so we can click
10:46 - right and then we can go ahead and click
10:49 - on script
10:50 - okay so let's delete print hello world
10:53 - for now
10:54 - okay and what we want to do is we want
10:57 - to
10:58 - code the timer and the timer is going to
11:00 - start at
11:01 - 300 so five minutes in seconds all right
11:05 - and then it ends at minus one negative
11:08 - one
11:08 - and since the loop will minus one each
11:10 - time it will create the effect that
11:12 - there is a countdown
11:14 - okay so the way you do that is start
11:16 - with the loop while true
11:17 - do or i equals 300
11:21 - beginning right 300 seconds
11:30 - okay wait one it's just a buffer time
11:35 - and then script dot
11:38 - script dot parent dot text
11:42 - okay we'll make it equal to countdown
11:51 - i and it will say if script dot
11:54 - parent dot text equals to
11:59 - count down
12:02 - negative one then
12:06 - script dot
12:12 - parent destroy
12:20 - like so
12:23 - all right so after we have added the
12:25 - script right here then we have completed
12:28 - our
12:28 - game scene and you can now test the game
12:31 - to see if you can move
12:32 - around and inside and out of the
12:34 - building to find the envelopes
12:36 - and you would notice that the time's
12:38 - also running on the screen
12:42 - all right so now i'm gonna test if our
12:44 - countdown timer is working
12:45 - i'm gonna go ahead and click play
12:53 - all right so as you can see now the
12:55 - timer is
12:56 - counting down and let's try
13:00 - to go inside the library
13:04 - okay which is right here
13:13 - all right
13:16 - all right so here i can go ahead and
13:18 - grab
13:20 - our red envelope right here
13:24 - so that's all for today in the next
13:26 - tutorial we'll learn how to code the
13:28 - game by adding a score system to the
13:30 - game to count how many red envelopes
13:32 - have been found
13:33 - and make sure to subscribe to our

i will teach you how to create the game using roblox studio and in the second part i'll be teaching you how to code the project using code kingdoms so let's get started all right so let's go ahead and create our game scene so first i'm going to code kingdoms to create a custom project and i'm going to rename the project as red envelope quest and i am also going to select it as a base plate all right and we can go ahead and click start okay then i'm going to go ahead and add a new file called red envelope which is an object and i'm going to add it as a local behavior all right so add red envelope okay object and local behavior and go ahead and add it then all right after we have created our project we want to download it and open it in roblox studio all right okay now that we have the project downloaded into roblox studio the next thing we want to do is we want to create a ground so we want to choose part right here okay and we want to change the material to be concrete all right concrete and we want to change the color to either black or gray to give sort of the natural effect of a road and then we're going to stretch it using the scale tool right here okay to make it cover

gonna go ahead and add in a domino's pizza okay so domino's pizza all right so i have my domino's pizza right here i will put it in front of the coffee shop all right and then i want to go ahead and add a bakery as well so i'm gonna switch that up right here okay all right let me place it right next to the coffee shop okay and then i'm going to add in a library okay let's place that okay right next to the bakery let's go ahead and also rotate it alright then i want to go and add a shop all right and the last thing i'm going to add after the shop is a shopping center i'm going to go ahead and add this one right here okay and we'll place it in the space we have around there okay now the next thing we want to do is we want to add a spawn location in the middle of the city so that we can easily access or move around okay so we'll get a spawning point okay and we want to place it in the middle of the city sits right around there okay all right now that we have the spawn place okay we will be making the red envelopes or your treasures so what we want to do is we want to choose part okay so let's close up the toolbox we want to choose part a right there and we want to go ahead and change the material to the plastic all right and the color to red okay right here and we're going to read rename this part as red envelope okay and in this part we also want to add some sparkles so first of all let's go ahead and rename them okay rename them to red envelope all right then let's add some sparkle all right so let's sparkle okay and just click on that and then we have it okay so now we're going to create 10 of these envelopes so we need to duplicate them and we can use this component right here to duplicate it all right so we'll go ahead duplicate duplicate until we have 10 of them all right so i'm at my 10th one so right click duplicate now we have 10 of them right so if we move them out we have three four five six seven eight nine and ten okay all right now the next thing we want to do is by using the move tool okay in our home we can place the red envelopes inside the buildings now we can make them difficult to find by placing them in places which are hard to find like under a chair or in a faraway room okay and some buildings can also have one envelope or two envelopes and some will have even more all right let's go ahead and do that all right i've hidden all my 10 envelopes for example i have hidden one here in the library in the second floor so the players would have to climb up this stair right here to be able to reach it okay so now we are going to

beginning right 300 seconds okay wait one it's just a buffer time and then script dot script dot parent dot text okay we'll make it equal to countdown i and it will say if script dot parent dot text equals to count down negative one then script dot parent destroy like so all right so after we have added the script right here then we have completed our game scene and you can now test the game to see if you can move around and inside and out of the building to find the envelopes and you would notice that the time's also running on the screen all right so now i'm gonna test if our countdown timer is working i'm gonna go ahead and click play all right so as you can see now the timer is counting down and let's try to go inside the library okay which is right here all right all right so here i can go ahead and grab our red envelope right here so that's all for today in the next tutorial we'll learn how to code the game by adding a score system to the game to count how many red envelopes have been found and make sure to subscribe to our channel to check out the next section of this project and don't forget to hit the like button thank you bye
