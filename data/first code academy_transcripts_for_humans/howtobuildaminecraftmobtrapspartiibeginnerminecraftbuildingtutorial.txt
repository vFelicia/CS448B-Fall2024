00:00 - hello everyone welcome to first code
00:01 - academy in today's video we're going to
00:03 - look at how we're going to make traps in
00:05 - minecraft
00:07 - so here i'm in survival mode and what
00:11 - and the mod that we have here is a
00:13 - staircase that's going up
00:15 - and what happens here is when your
00:16 - character or your friend join your
00:18 - server and they step on the presser
00:20 - plate
00:20 - it will move away the staircase to the
00:23 - other side
00:23 - so let's test it out so right now i'm in
00:25 - survival mode
00:27 - so let's walk to this and slowly slowly
00:30 - go
00:30 - over here oops i jump let's go again
00:34 - oh oh oh i fell into the lava
00:37 - and there's no way to escape so i die in
00:39 - the lab so that's how our
00:42 - trap works so let's begin
00:46 - so here what we can do first is we can
00:49 - add
00:49 - in three rows here
00:52 - and three empty rows here and then what
00:55 - we're gonna do
00:56 - we're gonna find our stitch piston
00:59 - and so first over here
01:03 - we can add one here
01:07 - and on top of this we can add in
01:25 - here and then
01:29 - what we have to do here is just
01:35 - well for now and what we're trying to do
01:38 - here
01:39 - is we're gonna add in some redstone
01:44 - so redstone powder
01:52 - here
01:55 - and here
01:59 - here here we're gonna add in a torch
02:09 - [Music]
02:16 - here
02:20 - spacing one
02:22 - [Music]
02:24 - two and then here
02:30 - fire and then we added some plate
02:35 - [Music]
02:44 - so in here what we can do and just
02:48 - break something and what we can add
02:52 - under this is some lava
02:56 - so we can press on e and
03:04 - here
03:16 - so far this
03:19 - um next we're going to add in some
03:21 - stairs so
03:23 - use any stairs you like i'll just use
03:25 - this
03:27 - one's over here
03:46 - you fall into the lava that's how our
03:50 - trap would work
03:51 - next what we'd have to do is we can just
03:54 - add in some coverings on the side using
03:56 - the iron block
03:58 - so this here
04:02 - and just add this
04:12 - here
04:27 - here we go
04:53 - and here
04:58 - then as more steps have to be added you
05:01 - can add
05:02 - a block like this over here
05:10 - structure here
05:14 - and the same can be done for this side
05:22 - this
05:42 - some steps towards here
06:12 - yes
06:18 - here
06:23 - here so you can add in steps
06:32 - here we
06:46 - and to cover this up you can just add
06:48 - this
06:51 - here
07:00 - so that's how this is made and then
07:03 - suppose someone doesn't know and they're
07:04 - walking
07:06 - just first clear this make sure we're in
07:09 - game mode survival
07:12 - and then once someone's talking
07:20 - so this is how you can make your your
07:22 - trap and then trick your friend
