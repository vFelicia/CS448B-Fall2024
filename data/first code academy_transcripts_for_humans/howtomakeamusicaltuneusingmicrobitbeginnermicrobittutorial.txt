00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we're going to create a star wars
00:13 - symphony with micro bits happy 4th of
00:16 - may to all of you
00:17 - and may the force be with you in this
00:19 - project
00:20 - we'll learn to make a star wars tone
00:23 - using micro bits
00:24 - with mid code and blocks we'll make the
00:26 - starting tone of star wars using musical
00:29 - notes so let's get started
00:31 - so let's go over to
00:34 - makecode.microfits.org
00:35 - to start a new project here we can
00:37 - actually delete the onstart
00:39 - and forever block yes we will not need
00:41 - it for this project
00:44 - next go down to advanced
00:48 - and go to control and drag out run in
00:51 - background
00:53 - this block will make sure that we can
00:55 - run any code in the background
00:56 - of our micro bits program next
01:00 - go over to basic and grab the show
01:03 - string
01:04 - block over here and let's change the
01:06 - content of this
01:09 - string into star wars
01:14 - and uh the force awaken
01:20 - and this uh the show shrink blocks uh
01:22 - will display
01:24 - the stuff we wrote here as a string in
01:27 - the background of our program
01:29 - and string is a data format for us
01:31 - display text
01:33 - so now let's begin our music
01:36 - um notes for the actual star wars tones
01:41 - here we want to play the actual tones
01:44 - when the user have clicked
01:45 - on a button and here we're going to say
01:47 - when the user click on button a we'll
01:49 - play the music
01:51 - so let's go over to here we're going to
01:54 - grab the on button a pressed
01:58 - and now we also want to grab a loop
02:02 - that can allow us to repeat our tone so
02:04 - we don't have to write the same tones
02:06 - again
02:06 - and you'll just have a repeat loop that
02:09 - will
02:10 - run the tones four times for us
02:13 - indicated by this four times here
02:16 - so instead of this repeat loop we want
02:19 - to write
02:19 - and put down our music blocks so we will
02:22 - play the tones
02:24 - here let's go to music so the first
02:26 - thing we're going to grab is play tone
02:28 - middle c
02:30 - and we're going to drag it inside and
02:33 - you can change
02:34 - the tones by just clicking on it and
02:36 - there's a piano
02:37 - and um you can see that here's a sound
02:40 - so we're going to try to find um metal g
02:43 - which is right here
02:45 - and so yep now we have middle g and
02:48 - let's change this one beat
02:50 - to a fourth of beat so one fourth
02:53 - beat now let's go back to music
02:57 - and let's grab the rest
03:00 - here we want to change one beats again
03:04 - and this time we'll change it to 1 8
03:07 - and we'll repeat these two blocks two
03:09 - more times so let's go over to music
03:12 - play tone again change it to
03:16 - middle g and change this
03:19 - to a fourth of a beat and again we'll be
03:23 - resting for one eighth
03:26 - of a beat
03:30 - and one last time play tone middle c
03:35 - click on middle c here and change the
03:38 - tone to middle g
03:41 - and now change the beats to 1 4
03:44 - and again let's drag in the rest
03:48 - um for 1 8 of a beat
03:52 - just like that next we're gonna once
03:55 - again go back to music
03:58 - here we're gonna grab the play tone
04:00 - middle c
04:01 - and we're going to drag in here and
04:03 - we're actually going to leave it as it
04:04 - is
04:05 - so we will keep middle c and we'll keep
04:07 - the one beat
04:09 - and we're actually going to drag another
04:11 - play tone you know c for one beat
04:14 - so it's two of them in a row next let's
04:17 - drag in another music
04:19 - play tones and here instead of middle c
04:22 - we'll change it back to middle g
04:25 - and we can also keep the beat for one
04:29 - and again let's go over to music
04:33 - tones and play tones here again we're
04:36 - gonna change it to middle g
04:38 - and keep it as one beat
04:42 - and now again we're going to go to music
04:45 - play tones
04:49 - and now we actually want a middle f
04:53 - so the middle f
04:56 - will be somewhere in the middle and it's
04:58 - right here
05:00 - and for middle f we'll change this to a
05:02 - fourth of a beat
05:04 - so we'll play for four fifa beats
05:07 - now let's go back to music and grab the
05:10 - rest
05:12 - put under here we're going to rest for
05:14 - an a-flat beat
05:16 - so let's change this to our eighth of a
05:18 - beat
05:20 - and again let's go to music and we're
05:23 - gonna grab
05:24 - the play tone again
05:27 - now let's change the middle c to middle
05:30 - e
05:30 - so again let's click on here and all the
05:33 - middle should be in the middle of this
05:34 - piano so we can just go through
05:36 - middle east right here
05:42 - and we'll change this to one fourth of a
05:45 - beat
05:48 - and let's go again to music and now
05:51 - we're going to rest again
05:52 - for an f of a beat so here let's change
05:55 - it to
05:56 - a awesome and let's go back to music
06:02 - again we're going to grab play tones
06:05 - and here we're going to say play tone
06:07 - for middle d
06:08 - so let's click on middle c and find
06:11 - middle d
06:11 - which is right next to it and here we're
06:14 - going to play
06:14 - middle d for fourth of a beat
06:19 - again we're going to go to music grab
06:22 - tone
06:24 - here we're going to write um play the
06:27 - tone high c
06:28 - so here let's click on here here's the
06:30 - low part so here should be the high
06:32 - parts and let's find high c
06:34 - and we'll keep this at one beat so high
06:38 - c for one beat
06:41 - again let's go to music and again we'll
06:43 - be playing high c for one beat again
06:46 - so here after we drag it in let's
06:49 - change it to high c
06:52 - and again we can uh keep the beats s1
06:56 - now let's go again to play tones
07:02 - and this time we're gonna have middle g
07:04 - for one beat
07:05 - so here let's change this middle g
07:10 - and we keep this to one beat
07:13 - and again now we need a play tone from
07:16 - middle f
07:17 - so here go to music play tones
07:22 - let's change this to middle f
07:25 - and we change this to a fourth of a beat
07:29 - so this is the current um music that we
07:32 - have i know it's a little bit long
07:34 - but this will play out and you actually
07:36 - played the star wars stones for us
07:40 - after this
07:43 - let's go to music and we'll once again
07:47 - use
07:47 - rest
07:51 - and here we'll change this beats to 1 8
07:57 - and now we want to put a middle e after
08:00 - this
08:01 - so play tone
08:05 - uh middle e which is right here
08:08 - and we'll play this for a fourth of a
08:10 - beat
08:13 - and then we'll rest for an eighth of a
08:15 - beat again
08:16 - so let's go rest
08:20 - and then one eighth
08:26 - now let's continue dragging music blocks
08:29 - here go to music play tones
08:32 - we're going to change this to middle d
08:36 - and we're going to change this to 1 4 of
08:38 - a beat
08:41 - now this is going to be followed by two
08:43 - high c's
08:44 - so here we're gonna have play tones
08:49 - go to high c and you'll be for one beat
08:55 - and we need two of those so let's drag
08:57 - in another another one
09:00 - go to high c keep it as one beats
09:05 - and now let's drag in two more of these
09:08 - tones before we pause again
09:10 - we're going to have a middle g for one
09:12 - beat so let's find middle g
09:15 - for beat and then we also need a middle
09:18 - f
09:18 - for a fourth of a beat so let's try
09:21 - again
09:23 - and change this to your middle f
09:26 - let's change this to one fourth
09:30 - and we're almost done now let's add
09:33 - another
09:34 - rest so here let's go to music
09:38 - rest let's change this to 1
09:41 - 8 and now let's add another
09:46 - play tones we're going to play the
09:48 - middle e
09:51 - so let's find middle e and we'll change
09:54 - the beats to 1 4
09:57 - and we're going to take a small break so
10:01 - let's put in the rest and 1
10:04 - 8 of a beat now let's drag in another
10:08 - play tones
10:13 - here we'll change middle c to middle f
10:16 - again
10:18 - and i will play this for a fourth of a
10:20 - beat again
10:22 - and uh let's add another rest
10:28 - change this to 1 8th
10:31 - and we have two more music tones to add
10:33 - and then we will have our musical tunes
10:36 - here let's go play tones change this to
10:40 - middle d
10:41 - i'm going to keep this as one beat and
10:44 - uh let's
10:45 - drag another and again this will be
10:50 - a middle d with one beat
10:53 - so these are the tones that are needed
10:55 - to play the star wars
10:57 - uh symphony and here we can play the
10:59 - starting tones of
11:00 - star wars by just playing all of these
11:03 - tones in order
11:04 - and since we have repeat four times um
11:07 - this replay four times
11:09 - so let's try it actually and click and
11:13 - here we're playing the star wars sounds
11:17 - using all of these tones
11:21 - and again they repeat it because we
11:22 - accept repeat four times
11:25 - so that's all for today in today's
11:27 - tutorial we created a musical symphony
11:30 - with the use of microbits music blocks
11:32 - to create the star wars theme song i
11:35 - hope you guys like it

hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a star wars symphony with micro bits happy 4th of may to all of you and may the force be with you in this project we'll learn to make a star wars tone using micro bits with mid code and blocks we'll make the starting tone of star wars using musical notes so let's get started so let's go over to makecode.microfits.org to start a new project here we can actually delete the onstart and forever block yes we will not need it for this project next go down to advanced and go to control and drag out run in background this block will make sure that we can run any code in the background of our micro bits program next go over to basic and grab the show string block over here and let's change the content of this string into star wars and uh the force awaken and this uh the show shrink blocks uh will display the stuff we wrote here as a string in the background of our program and string is a data format for us display text so now let's begin our music um notes for the actual star wars tones here we want to play the actual tones when the user have clicked on a button and here we're going to say when the user click on button a we'll play the music so let's go over to here we're going to grab the on button a pressed and now we also want to grab a loop that can allow us to repeat our tone so we don't have to write the same tones again and you'll just have a repeat loop that will run the tones four times for us indicated by this four times here so instead of this repeat loop we want to write and put down our music blocks so we will play the tones here let's go to music so the first thing we're going

find um metal g which is right here and so yep now we have middle g and let's change this one beat to a fourth of beat so one fourth beat now let's go back to music and let's grab the rest here we want to change one beats again and this time we'll change it to 1 8 and we'll repeat these two blocks two more times so let's go over to music play tone again change it to middle g and change this to a fourth of a beat and again we'll be resting for one eighth of a beat and one last time play tone middle c click on middle c here and change the tone to middle g and now change the beats to 1 4 and again let's drag in the rest um for 1 8 of a beat just like that next we're gonna once again go back to music here we're gonna grab the play tone middle c and we're going to drag in here and we're actually going to leave it as it is so we will keep middle c and we'll keep the one beat and we're actually going to drag another play tone you know c for one beat so it's two of them in a row next let's drag in another music play tones and here instead of middle c we'll change it back to middle g and we can also keep the beat for one and again let's go over to music tones and play tones here again we're gonna change it to middle g and keep it as one beat and now again we're going to go to music play tones and now we actually want a middle f so the middle f will be somewhere in the middle and it's right here and for middle f we'll change this to a fourth of a beat so we'll play for four fifa beats now let's go back to music and grab the rest put under here we're going to rest for an aflat beat so let's change this to our eighth of a beat and again let's go to music and we're gonna grab the play tone again now let's change the middle c to middle e so again let's click on here and all the middle should be in the middle of this piano so we can just go through middle east right here and we'll change this to one fourth of a beat and let's go again to music and now we're going to rest again for an f of a beat so here let's change it to a awesome and let's go back to music again we're going to grab play tones and here we're going to say play tone for middle d so let's click on middle c and find middle d which is right next to it and here we're going to play middle d for fourth of a beat again we're going to go to music grab tone here we're going to write um play the tone high c so here let's click on here here's the low part so here should be the high parts and let's find high c and we'll keep this at one beat so high c for one beat again let's go to music and again we'll be playing high c for one beat again so here after we drag it in let's change it to high c and again we can uh keep the beats s1 now let's go again to play tones and this time we're gonna have middle g for one beat so here let's change this middle g and we keep this to one beat and again now we need a play tone from middle f so here go to music play tones let's change this to middle f and we change this to a fourth of a beat so this is the current um music that we have i know it's a little bit long but this will play out and you actually played the star wars stones for us after this let's go to music and we'll once again use rest and here we'll change this beats to 1 8 and now we want to put a middle e after this so play tone uh middle e which is right here and we'll play this for a fourth of a beat and then we'll rest for an eighth of a beat again so let's go rest and then one eighth now let's continue dragging music blocks here go to music play tones we're going to change this to middle d and we're going to change this to 1 4 of a beat now this is going to be followed by two high c's so here we're gonna have play tones go to high c and you'll be for one beat and we need two of those so let's drag in another another one go to high c keep it as one beats and now let's drag in two more of these tones before we pause again we're going to have a middle g for one beat so let's find middle g for beat and then we also need a middle f for a fourth of a beat so let's try again and change this to your middle f let's change this to one fourth and we're almost done now let's add another rest so here let's go to music rest let's change this to 1 8 and now let's add another play tones we're going to play the middle e so let's find middle e and we'll change the beats to 1 4 and we're going to take a small break so let's put in the rest and 1 8 of a beat now let's drag in another play tones here we'll change middle c to middle f again and i will play this for a fourth of a beat again and uh let's add another rest change this to 1 8th and we have two more music tones to add and then we will have our musical tunes here let's go play tones change this to middle d i'm going to keep this as one beat and uh let's drag another and again this will be a middle d with one beat so these are the tones that are needed to play the star wars uh symphony and here we can play the starting tones of star wars by just playing all of these tones in order and since we have repeat four times um this replay four times so let's try it actually and click and here we're playing the star wars sounds using all of these tones and again they repeat it because we accept repeat four times so that's all for today in today's tutorial we created a musical symphony with the use of
