00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share beginner-friendly
00:04 - tutorials on minecraft
00:06 - roblox scratch web programming and many
00:09 - more
00:09 - today we'll learn how to build a capsule
00:11 - in minecraft using javascript
00:14 - so as you can see this is a structure
00:16 - that we're gonna be building
00:17 - and um yes four walls and
00:21 - under each corner there's a castle
00:24 - or a mini tower and to build the tower
00:27 - to build the castle all you need to do
00:30 - is
00:31 - stand to anywhere you want to place a
00:32 - capsule look at the ground
00:34 - and type js castle
00:38 - like this and you can wait a second
00:43 - the castle should start building itself
00:47 - so you see the door being made the walls
00:50 - are being formed
00:52 - and um the towers are being created
00:56 - so yeah let's get started we'll begin
00:59 - the project by writing our function
01:01 - in sublime text here we can first create
01:04 - our first file
01:05 - so here we go to file new file
01:10 - and we can actually save it right now so
01:11 - we can go to file
01:14 - save as and where we want to save it is
01:18 - actually where we store
01:20 - our spaghot server file so here i can go
01:24 - to my desktop i have it saved inside of
01:27 - spots
01:29 - 1.10.2 and i've also installed
01:32 - scriptcraft so i'm going to go into
01:33 - plugins
01:35 - next to scriptcraft i'm just going to
01:36 - save this as castle
01:41 - and make sure to save as type is all
01:43 - files
01:44 - i'm gonna click save so now anything
01:48 - right here can be used in the minecraft
01:50 - server
01:52 - so the first thing we have to do is to
01:55 - write down a function
01:57 - a function is a set of instructions for
01:59 - the computer to follow
02:01 - so if you name our function cancel
02:05 - with an empty parameter so there's no
02:07 - inputs required
02:09 - this means that this is a function
02:12 - called castle that when we call off
02:14 - we'll run
02:14 - the following instructions so we want to
02:17 - set this castle to a function so we set
02:19 - it equal to a function
02:22 - and we still don't have any user input
02:24 - so we keep the parameters
02:25 - as empty another thing before we start
02:29 - writing the function is we want to
02:31 - export it
02:33 - before writing a function
02:36 - we want to export the function by
02:38 - exporting function
02:39 - we can actually use the function inside
02:42 - of a minecraft server
02:44 - so here we just write exports and now
02:47 - anything we type inside of this bracket
02:50 - called block will be executed when the
02:53 - function castle
02:54 - is uh run
02:58 - so inside of our function we first want
03:02 - to say
03:03 - build the walls and to build a wall we
03:06 - use a cylinder
03:08 - and we'll be using the cylinder zero
03:10 - here
03:11 - and the reason right zero at the end is
03:13 - because it creates a hollow
03:16 - cylinder which means that there's going
03:18 - to be four walls outside
03:20 - with nothing in the middle
03:23 - so the parameters for cylinder zero is
03:26 - the type of block
03:27 - width height so the first thing we want
03:29 - to do
03:30 - is put down the blocks in the first
03:32 - parameter
03:33 - so here i'll use blocks dot brick
03:36 - dot red that's my blocks for uh
03:40 - the walls i want the walls to be 10
03:43 - blocks wide and five blocks tall
03:47 - and if we imagine a drone
03:51 - building our castle the drone will first
03:55 - build a cylinder
03:56 - that is hollow using bricks that are 10
04:00 - blocks wide and five blocks tall
04:02 - and we can actually relocate the drone
04:05 - to build more stuff in a different
04:06 - location
04:08 - and we do that by simply reading right
04:11 - left up forward or down
04:14 - so here we're gonna move the drone seven
04:17 - blocks to the right
04:19 - and also move it forward by seven blocks
04:23 - now i wanna build an empty box
04:27 - that will be shown as a castle
04:30 - and the tower under each side of the
04:32 - corner so here i'm gonna write box
04:35 - zero inside the box zero i have four
04:38 - parameters
04:39 - blocks width height
04:43 - and depth so the blocks will be
04:46 - blocks dot cobblestone i want to build
04:48 - it using cobblestone
04:50 - i want to be seven blocks wide five
04:53 - blocks tall
04:54 - and seven blocks depth and here width
04:57 - and depth is pretty much
04:59 - uh very similar we wanted to be
05:01 - symmetrical so we want them to be the
05:03 - same
05:04 - now i want to move up and build my
05:06 - second floor in the roof
05:08 - so i'm going to say dot up i'm gonna
05:10 - move five blocks up
05:12 - once i've moved five blocks up i want
05:14 - our drone to build
05:15 - a box that is not empty so here i'll use
05:18 - box
05:21 - and the blocks i'm gonna use it's to say
05:23 - blocks dot slab
05:25 - dot stone break
05:29 - i want this box to be seven blocks wide
05:32 - one block tall and seven blocks back
05:37 - now it's time to build our floor for the
05:39 - second floor
05:40 - so here i'm going to use a hollow box
05:44 - i'm going to build the hollow box using
05:46 - a fence
05:48 - material of oak here i want the width to
05:51 - be seven
05:52 - height again to be one with again to be
05:55 - seven
05:57 - now it's time to build the door so we're
05:59 - gonna move back down
06:00 - by five blocks and after that i'm gonna
06:04 - also move to the right by three blocks
06:08 - and here i'm gonna make space for the
06:10 - door so i'm gonna write
06:12 - box blocks dot air
06:15 - that will remove anything that's
06:17 - currently at that spot
06:19 - and i'll use the same dimension as a
06:21 - door which is one block wide
06:23 - two blocks high and one block deep
06:27 - and now i can move back the drone by
06:29 - seven blocks and put down the doors
06:32 - so here i'm going to write box and the
06:35 - block
06:35 - number we can actually use um by looking
06:39 - up the block number
06:40 - in case of a door we find that the block
06:43 - number is 196.
06:46 - so we can simply write 196
06:49 - and then the width should be one
06:52 - height should be two and uh depth be one
06:56 - and that will end our whole instructions
07:00 - and this one line of code will actually
07:02 - build the whole castle for us
07:04 - so let's see um how that works so
07:07 - let's just go to files and save
07:11 - and here to boot up the server we can
07:13 - actually go
07:15 - to terminal or command prompt so i'm
07:17 - going to type in command
07:21 - go into command prompt and when you're
07:24 - activating the server
07:26 - you should use your personal id so
07:28 - define your id you can do one or two
07:31 - things
07:32 - you can first write ip config
07:35 - and here your ip address will be located
07:38 - under
07:39 - i pv4 address and
07:42 - so this is going to be my local address
07:44 - when i host the server
07:46 - another way to look at it is go on any
07:48 - web browsers
07:50 - and simply type in my ip address
07:55 - and as you can see my public ip is the
07:58 - same
07:59 - as what is shown over here
08:03 - once you have the ip you can start to
08:05 - boot up the server
08:06 - so to do that we want to go to the file
08:09 - where you have
08:10 - all your server files at so i'm going to
08:13 - go to the folder
08:14 - desktop specs
08:18 - at 1.10.2
08:21 - so now i have entered this folder
08:24 - and to start up the server i simply
08:26 - write java
08:28 - for java jar
08:33 - and to enter the server i type java
08:36 - dash jar space
08:40 - the name of the file shows spec got
08:44 - dash 1.10.2
08:47 - dot jar and when i press
08:51 - enter the server will start to boot up
08:55 - and um and anyone could join the server
08:57 - using this public iep right here
09:01 - so once the library has finished loading
09:03 - it will load up the world
09:05 - and um yeah once you enter the server
09:08 - you can type castle with an empty
09:11 - parameter
09:12 - and then it will actually do it so it is
09:14 - still booting up
09:15 - yep and it is done so to run the java
09:19 - program
09:20 - you can enter the game and type slash js
09:23 - castle brackets and close brackets
09:27 - and this code will um start to build
09:30 - the caster in front of you so that is
09:32 - all for today
09:34 - we learned how to make a castle using
09:36 - javascript and minecraft
09:38 - hope you guys enjoyed be sure to like
09:40 - and subscribe and i'll see you next time
09:42 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly tutorials on minecraft roblox scratch web programming and many more today we'll learn how to build a capsule in minecraft using javascript so as you can see this is a structure that we're gonna be building and um yes four walls and under each corner there's a castle or a mini tower and to build the tower to build the castle all you need to do is stand to anywhere you want to place a capsule look at the ground and type js castle like this and you can wait a second the castle should start building itself so you see the door being made the walls are being formed and um the towers are being created so yeah let's get started we'll begin the project by writing our function in sublime text here we can first create our first file so here we go to file new file and we can actually save it right now so we can go to file save as and where we want to save it is actually where we store our spaghot server file so here i can go to my desktop i have it saved inside of spots 1.10.2 and i've also installed scriptcraft so i'm going to go into plugins next to scriptcraft i'm just going to save this as castle and make sure to save as type is all files i'm gonna click save so now anything right here can be used in the minecraft server so the first thing we have to do is to write down a function a function is a set of instructions for the computer to follow so if you name our function cancel with an empty parameter so there's no inputs required this means that this is a function called castle that when we call off we'll run the following instructions so we want to set this castle to a function so we set it equal to a function and we still don't have any user input so we keep the parameters as empty another thing before we start writing the function is we want to export it before writing a function we want to export the function by exporting function we can actually use the function inside of a minecraft server so here we just write exports and now anything we type inside of this bracket called block will be executed when the function castle is uh run so inside of our function we first want to say build the walls and to build a wall we use a cylinder and we'll be using the cylinder zero here and the reason right zero at the end is because it creates a hollow cylinder which means that there's going to be four walls outside with nothing in the middle so the parameters for cylinder zero is the type of block width height so the first thing we want to do is put down the blocks in the first parameter so here i'll use blocks dot brick dot red that's my blocks for uh the walls i want the walls to be 10 blocks wide and five blocks tall and if we imagine a drone building our castle the drone will first build a cylinder that is hollow using bricks that are 10 blocks wide and five blocks tall and we can actually relocate the drone to build more stuff in a different location and we do that by simply reading right left up forward or down so here we're gonna move the drone seven blocks to the right and also move it forward by seven blocks now i wanna build an empty box that will be shown as a castle and the tower under each side of the corner so here i'm gonna write box zero inside the box zero i have four parameters blocks width height and depth so the blocks will be blocks dot cobblestone i want to build it using cobblestone i want to be seven blocks wide five blocks tall and seven blocks depth and here width and depth is pretty much uh very similar we wanted to be symmetrical so we want them to be the same now i want to move up and build my second floor in the roof so i'm going to say dot up i'm gonna move five blocks up once i've moved five blocks up i want our drone to build a box that is not empty so here i'll use box and the blocks i'm gonna use it's to say blocks dot slab dot stone break i want this box to be seven blocks wide one block tall and seven blocks back now it's time to build our floor for the second floor so here i'm going to use a hollow box i'm going to build the hollow box using a fence material of oak here i want the width to be seven height again to be one with again to be seven now it's time to build the door so we're gonna move back down by five blocks and after that i'm gonna also move to the right by three blocks and here i'm gonna make space for the door so i'm gonna write box blocks dot air that will remove anything that's currently at that spot and i'll use the same dimension as a door which is one block wide two blocks high and one block deep and now i can move back the drone by seven blocks and put down the doors so here i'm going to write box and the block number we can actually use um by looking up the block number in case of a door we find that the block number is 196. so we can simply write 196 and then the width should be one height should be two and uh depth be one and that will end our whole instructions and this one line of code will actually build the whole castle for us so let's see um how that works so let's just go to files and save and here to boot up the server we can actually go to terminal or command prompt so i'm going to type in command go into command prompt and when you're activating the server you should use your personal id so define your id you can do one or two

then it will actually do it so it is still booting up yep and it is done so to run the java program you can enter the game and type slash js castle brackets and close brackets and this code will um start to build the caster in front of you so that is all for today we learned how to make a castle using javascript and minecraft hope you guys enjoyed be sure to like and subscribe and i'll see you
