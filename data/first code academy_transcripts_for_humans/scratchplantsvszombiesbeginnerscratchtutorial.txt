00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - channel
00:03 - here is your beginner friendly coding
00:04 - tutorials on scratch
00:06 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:08 - many more
00:09 - today we are going to create a plans via
00:12 - zombie game
00:14 - so this is the game for the scratch uh
00:16 - plans to be a song begin
00:18 - so when i click the queen select button
00:20 - when i press the up and down
00:21 - console and then press the space b bar
00:24 - uh
00:25 - it will kill the zombie like that and
00:27 - then there's another
00:28 - plant and when you click to
00:32 - it kind of tells the zombie as well
00:35 - so well since we're using scratch
00:39 - scratch is actually a website that
00:41 - allows us to create
00:42 - animations and games using block based
00:44 - coding so the game we create utilize
00:47 - conditionals
00:48 - motion keyboard defense and variable so
00:51 - let's get started so now we can start
00:54 - turning
00:55 - inside our scratch template you can find
00:57 - in the description box below
00:59 - so open the template you can see that um
01:02 - there's already the sprites
01:04 - the background and then everything is
01:06 - well designed
01:08 - uh we're going to move on to our coding
01:10 - so
01:11 - first of all uh go to our variables
01:14 - we're going to make three variables
01:16 - which is
01:18 - the three zombies so zombie
01:23 - and then zombie
01:26 - two and then zombie
01:31 - three like that so we created three
01:33 - variables
01:34 - okay so in order to not blocking our
01:37 - sprites
01:38 - we're just going to move all of these
01:41 - scores
01:43 - at the bottom of our screen like that
01:46 - so we can see their health at the bottom
01:49 - of the screen
01:50 - all right after our variables
01:53 - uh we will start coding starting with
01:55 - our chamber so inside chomper
01:58 - um first of all click drag the one
02:01 - green select click and then
02:05 - next thing we're going to do is actually
02:08 - go to x and y so make sure that every
02:12 - time when we open our
02:14 - app our game it's on the same position
02:18 - and then drag it forever loop
02:21 - inside this form we have three
02:23 - conditions
02:24 - so three if then inside of first
02:28 - we're just going to get the f key up
02:31 - arrow pressed
02:33 - so which means if the error is first
02:36 - which is going up so that's why we're
02:39 - just going to move
02:41 - our y by 10 if it's not
02:45 - which is if the down down arrow is
02:48 - pressed
02:51 - our chomper which is going to move down
02:53 - so change y by negative 10
02:56 - oh
03:00 - i use 10 like that and when space key is
03:04 - pressed
03:05 - which means if
03:09 - it's shooting some balls okay we're just
03:12 - going to broadcast a new message
03:15 - squash it let's call it
03:19 - like that all right so we finished our
03:22 - chomper
03:23 - now we're going to move on to our plant
03:25 - actually
03:27 - uh okay so inside our plant uh they have
03:30 - very similar
03:31 - actions which is like moving up and down
03:34 - and they shoot some balls out
03:36 - so inside this one we're just gonna
03:38 - click when green flag is clicked again
03:41 - and then go to x and y in this position
03:45 - afterwards we're going to drag the
03:47 - fourth loop again
03:49 - and then three if then
03:53 - now for the plant key since we don't
03:56 - want it to
03:57 - crash or duplicate with the chomper
04:01 - i will just do another keys so
04:04 - instead of up down we're just going to
04:07 - get the w
04:08 - for up arrow so
04:11 - change y
04:15 - by 10 and
04:18 - if the s
04:22 - key s is pressed
04:26 - so we're going to change
04:30 - y by negative 10 again
04:34 - oh this is change x
04:38 - okay so and then for the space key
04:43 - we are going to change it to number two
04:47 - when the
04:47 - two key is pressed
04:50 - we want to broadcast message
04:54 - so since like they are shooting in
04:56 - different balls
04:57 - so there's like ball and ball too um
04:59 - bottoms represent
05:01 - s uh it's for plant and ball
05:05 - is associated with chomper so that's why
05:08 - they need
05:08 - two different broadcast message so a new
05:11 - message
05:12 - should too like that
05:15 - all right so this is um both the planet
05:18 - and chomper
05:19 - moving on to our zombies so first of all
05:23 - our first zombie this one so
05:26 - uh we're going to drag that when green
05:28 - flag is clicked
05:29 - and then uh we wanted to start at this
05:33 - position
05:34 - uh they started that so go to x and y
05:40 - like that oh don't remember to show the
05:43 - zombie
05:44 - first so like that and then why
05:48 - uh so for y uh we can actually pick some
05:51 - random uh
05:52 - integers for that so it just kind of
05:54 - pops up in a different
05:55 - position so from the range from 140 to
05:59 - negative 140 to 140 and then
06:02 - drag the forever loop again now
06:06 - we want to um we want our zombie
06:10 - to always point in direction negative 90
06:14 - and then move towards the left side
06:18 - uh and wait for a couple seconds
06:21 - so actually less than one second so
06:24 - point in direction negative 90
06:29 - so on your left side and then move
06:38 - from a random let's say two to five
06:41 - steps
06:42 - two to five so afterwards
06:47 - uh wait for 0.8 seconds
06:52 - and then this is how the zombie
06:56 - walk uh the other code we have to get is
06:59 - when when flight is is when they um
07:04 - hit the ball so
07:07 - when green flag is clicked first of all
07:10 - we're going to set
07:13 - our score of zombie
07:16 - 2 100 first so which is still health
07:20 - uh that's maximum health and
07:23 - we're going to do another forever loop
07:25 - inside this form of a loop
07:27 - we have three if statements
07:30 - again so drag me if then
07:34 - out but inside forever loop so the first
07:37 - one
07:37 - is actually when is touch when when is
07:40 - touching
07:41 - uh either of the balls so we are going
07:44 - to get
07:45 - the ore so the first thing
07:49 - uh touching so the first one is actually
07:52 - touching the ball
07:53 - and then the second one touching the
07:55 - ball too like that
07:57 - so i'm just touching the ball too okay
07:59 - so
08:00 - we're going to change our zombies health
08:04 - by negative 100 so it
08:08 - will become zero so obviously the next
08:12 - if statements are just going to be
08:16 - f zombie which is the index of that
08:19 - equals to zero first of all well it die
08:24 - basically so we're going to hide we're
08:27 - going to hide our zombie
08:29 - afterwards wait for a second
08:34 - and then after waiting a second it will
08:36 - respond to the original location
08:38 - which is like the start of the line so
08:41 - go to x
08:42 - and y x would be not 193
08:45 - y would be a pick of random in between
08:48 - well
08:49 - negative 140
08:52 - to 140 like that
08:56 - afterwards we're going to click the show
09:00 - so it shows up again and we're going to
09:03 - let it set its health back to 100
09:07 - so when use new zombies
09:10 - afterwards okay so there's one more
09:13 - thing
09:14 - uh for losing the game is when it
09:17 - touch the topper
09:21 - so in touch this chamber we're going to
09:23 - stop everything
09:25 - so stop our script inside
09:28 - yes so stop the script and this is how
09:32 - we lose the game
09:34 - so basically this this is like the code
09:37 - for the zombie
09:38 - um there are actually for this zombie 2
09:41 - and zombie 3
09:42 - they have very similar code as the first
09:45 - zombie so i'm just going to
09:48 - copy and play paste
09:51 - for the codes
09:54 - so for our second zombie um well
09:57 - basically it's
09:58 - just like pretty similar to our verse
10:02 - zombie so there is only a couple things
10:04 - that we want to change
10:05 - for our second zombie so for our second
10:07 - zombie instead of like
10:09 - oh it's that's like that we're going to
10:12 - change it to knight 193
10:14 - and then from a random height from
10:17 - negative 100
10:18 - to 100 so the range is like slightly
10:20 - smaller
10:21 - and then this step is just going to be a
10:23 - little bit faster since like the range
10:25 - is smaller so we don't have to move
10:27 - all right in the larger range so it's
10:29 - just going to be moving a little bit
10:31 - faster
10:32 - so and then the next thing we're going
10:34 - to do
10:35 - uh in this code well we're just going to
10:38 - set our zombie 2
10:39 - since this is the zombie 2. okay we're
10:42 - changing everything into
10:44 - every single variable into zombie two as
10:47 - well as like the score of that so
10:49 - drag it out zombie two it goes to zero
10:53 - like that
10:55 - so basically that's it for our second
10:58 - zombie
10:59 - and change it to a hundred this group
11:02 - yes
11:02 - so okay i'm going to
11:08 - copy this code to zombie 3 again
11:12 - and we do the whole thing so for example
11:15 - three
11:16 - we want our x and y like that
11:20 - and then the range is slightly larger
11:22 - when they start their game
11:24 - so negative 120
11:28 - to 120 like that and then we want it to
11:32 - be
11:32 - slow extremely slow for this zombie so
11:35 - we're just going to get the pick random
11:39 - that's just ranging from one steps to
11:41 - three steps
11:43 - all right so moving on to the next one
11:45 - the only thing we have to change is
11:46 - only the variables so zombie three
11:49 - zombie three
11:50 - and three and delete the 72
11:54 - put the sum three inside it's one second
11:57 - and we want to do the one negative 120
12:02 - and 120 again so that's it
12:06 - for our zombies okay so moving on to our
12:09 - last
12:10 - code which is the balls they both have
12:14 - similar
12:15 - codes again so let's code for the first
12:18 - ball
12:19 - okay drag the drag out the ring green
12:22 - flag is clicked
12:24 - and then we're going to hide
12:27 - our ball first
12:30 - the next thing that it kind of shows up
12:34 - when we press the either the space
12:38 - key bar or the key too so inside our
12:41 - ball
12:41 - uh we this ball only shows up when we
12:44 - press this
12:45 - space keyboard since it's like
12:47 - associated with the chomper
12:49 - only so when i receive this is a
12:53 - message for chomper so the next thing
12:56 - we're going to do
12:57 - after is press the spacebar we're going
13:00 - to show
13:01 - our ball and then
13:04 - we're gonna click go to chomper
13:08 - so this one
13:11 - and then pointing direction 90 so it's
13:14 - moving towards the right
13:16 - and repeat until
13:21 - loop here so in this ruby until we
13:24 - have four conditions for this
13:28 - so four of them will be
13:32 - well we're just going to put the or
13:36 - inside the ore inside or so there are
13:38 - four conditions
13:40 - so the first condition is when it's
13:42 - touching
13:43 - oh when it's touching the first zombie
13:49 - or if it's touching second zombie
13:54 - or if it's touching the third zombie
13:58 - or if it's touching to edge so
14:02 - there's a stopping point for that wall
14:05 - if it's touching
14:06 - if it's not touching either of these
14:10 - well we're just going to move 20 steps
14:12 - forward
14:14 - and afterwards we're just going to hide
14:16 - our ball
14:18 - again and then we're going to play a
14:21 - sound for our ball which is laser to
14:24 - that so basically that's it for uh the
14:27 - first ball
14:28 - so i'm going to copy and paste it on
14:30 - ball too again
14:31 - since it's a pretty similar
14:34 - condition so uh the only thing it
14:37 - changed
14:38 - is actually only two things that change
14:41 - is when i receive shoot 2 which is the
14:43 - broadcast message
14:44 - for the plant um it would not show
14:48 - in front of the chomper it would it'll
14:50 - be shown in front of the plant
14:52 - so that's the only change for the
14:56 - second ball so basically that's it for
14:59 - the game
15:00 - uh for the gameplay now let's try it out
15:03 - for
15:04 - that okay let's try it i'm gonna
15:08 - move the chomper okay it makes it
15:12 - zombies die like that okay so
15:15 - for my plant i'm moving with w
15:18 - and s when i press two it shoots a ball
15:22 - and when i press two it's just another
15:24 - ball like that
15:26 - so it dies like that so when they touch
15:29 - zombie
15:30 - as you can see the zombies tell this
15:33 - immediately
15:34 - immediately turn to zero after the ball
15:37 - touches the
15:38 - zombie like that so basically that's it
15:41 - that's the end of the game
15:45 - well so that's it for today in this
15:47 - tutorial
15:48 - we created a plan vs zombie game the use
15:51 - of scratch
15:52 - hope you like this video don't forget to

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to our channel here is your beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we are going to create a plans via zombie game so this is the game for the scratch uh plans to be a song begin so when i click the queen select button when i press the up and down console and then press the space b bar uh it will kill the zombie like that and then there's another plant and when you click to it kind of tells the zombie as well so well since we're using scratch scratch is actually a website that allows us to create animations and games using block based coding so the game we create utilize conditionals motion keyboard defense and variable so let's get started so now we can start turning inside our scratch template you can find in the description box below so open the template you can see that um there's already the sprites the background and then everything is well designed uh we're going to move on to our coding so first of all uh go to our variables we're going to make three variables which is the three zombies so zombie and then zombie two and then zombie three like that so we created three variables okay so in order to not blocking our sprites we're just going to move all of these scores at the bottom of our screen like that so we can see their health at the bottom of the screen all right after our variables uh we will start coding starting with our chamber so inside chomper um first of all click drag the one green select click and then next thing we're going to do is actually go to x and y so make sure that every time when we open our app our game it's on the same position and then drag it forever loop inside this form we have three conditions so three if then inside of first we're just going to get the f key up arrow pressed so which means if the error is first which is going up so that's why we're just going to move our y by 10 if it's not which is if the down down arrow is pressed our chomper which is going to move down so change y by negative 10 oh i use 10 like that and when space key is pressed which means if it's shooting some balls okay we're just going to broadcast a new message squash it let's call it like that all right so we finished our chomper now we're going to move on to our plant actually uh okay so inside our plant uh they have very similar actions which is like moving up and down and they shoot some balls out so inside this one we're just gonna click when green flag is clicked again and then go to x and y in this position afterwards we're going to drag the fourth loop again and then three if then now for the plant key since we don't want it to crash or duplicate with the chomper i will just do another keys so instead of up down we're just going to get the w for up arrow so change y by 10 and if the s key s is pressed so we're going to change y by negative 10 again oh this is change x okay so and then for the space key we are going to change it to number two when the two key is pressed we want to broadcast message so since like they are shooting in different balls so there's like ball and ball too um bottoms represent s uh it's for plant and ball is associated with chomper so that's why they need two different broadcast message so a new message should too like that all right so this is um both the planet and chomper moving on to our zombies so first of all our first zombie this one so uh we're going to drag that when green flag is clicked and then uh we wanted to start at this position uh they started that so go to x and y like that oh don't remember to show the zombie first so like that and then why uh so for y uh we can actually pick some random uh integers for that so it just kind of pops up in a different position so from the range from 140 to negative 140 to 140 and then drag the forever loop again now we want to um we want our zombie to always point in direction negative 90 and then move towards the left side uh and wait for a couple seconds so actually less than one second so point in direction negative 90 so on your left side and then move from a random let's say two to five steps two to five so afterwards uh wait for 0.8 seconds and then this is how the zombie walk uh the other code we have to get is when when flight is is when they um hit the ball so when green flag is clicked first of all we're going to set our score of zombie 2 100 first so which is still health uh that's maximum health and we're going to do another forever loop inside this form of a loop we have three if statements again so drag me if then out but inside forever loop so the first one is actually when is touch when when is touching uh either of the balls so we are going to get the ore so the first thing uh touching so the first one is actually touching the ball and then the second one touching the ball too like that so i'm just touching the ball too okay so we're going to change our zombies health by negative 100 so it will become zero so obviously the next if statements are just going to be f zombie which is the index of that equals to zero first of all well it die basically so we're going to hide we're going to hide our zombie afterwards wait for a second and then after waiting a second it will respond to the original location which is like the start of the line so go to x and y x would be not 193 y would be a pick of random in between well negative 140 to 140 like that afterwards we're going to click the show so it shows up again and we're going to let it set its health back to 100 so when use new zombies afterwards okay so there's one more thing uh for losing the game is when it touch the topper so in touch this chamber we're going to stop everything so stop our script inside yes so stop the script and this is how we lose the game so basically this this is like the code for the zombie um there are actually for this zombie 2 and zombie 3 they have very similar code as the first zombie so i'm just going to copy and play paste for the codes so for our second zombie um well basically it's just like pretty similar to our verse zombie so there is only a couple things that we want to change for our second zombie so for our second zombie instead of like oh it's that's like that we're going to change it to knight 193 and then from a random height from negative 100 to 100 so the range is like slightly smaller and then this step is just going to be a little bit faster since like the range is smaller so we don't have to move all right in the larger range so it's just going to be moving a little bit faster so and then the next thing we're going to do uh in this code well we're just going to set our zombie 2 since this is the zombie 2. okay we're changing everything into every single variable into zombie two as well as like the score of that so drag it out zombie two it goes to zero like that so basically that's it for our second zombie and change it to a hundred this group yes so okay i'm going to copy this code to zombie 3 again and we do the whole thing so for example three we want our x and y like that and then the range is slightly larger when they start their game so negative 120 to 120 like that and then we want it to be slow extremely slow for this zombie so we're just going to get the pick random that's just ranging from one steps to three steps all right so moving on to the next one the only thing we have to change is only the variables so zombie three zombie three and three and delete the 72 put the sum three inside it's one second and we want to do the one negative 120 and 120 again so that's it for our zombies okay so moving on to our last code which is the balls they both have similar codes again so let's code for the first ball okay drag the drag out the ring green flag is clicked and then we're going to hide our ball first the next thing that it kind of shows up when we press the either the space key bar or the key too so inside our ball uh we this ball only shows up when we press this space keyboard since it's like associated with the chomper only so when i receive this is a message for chomper so the next thing we're going to do after is press the spacebar we're going to show our ball and then we're gonna click go to chomper so this one and then pointing direction 90 so it's moving towards the right and repeat until loop here so in this ruby until we have four conditions for this so four of them will be well we're just going to put the or inside the ore inside or so there are four conditions so the first condition is when it's touching oh when it's touching the first zombie or if it's touching second zombie or if it's touching the third zombie or if it's touching to edge so there's a stopping point for that wall if it's touching if it's not touching either of these well we're just going to move 20 steps forward and afterwards we're just going to hide our ball again and then we're going to play a sound for our ball which is laser to that so basically that's it for uh the first ball so i'm going to copy and paste it on ball too again since it's a pretty similar condition so uh the only thing it changed is actually only two things that change is when i receive shoot 2 which is the broadcast message for the plant um it would not show in front of the chomper it would it'll be shown in front of the plant so that's the only change for the second ball so basically that's it for the game uh for the gameplay now let's try it out for that okay let's try it i'm gonna move the chomper okay it makes it zombies die like that okay so for my plant i'm moving with w and s when i press two it shoots a ball and when i press two it's just another ball like that so it dies like that so when they touch zombie as you can see the zombies tell this immediately immediately turn to zero after the ball touches the zombie like that so basically that's it that's the end of the game well so that's it for today in this tutorial we created a plan vs zombie game the use of scratch hope you like this video don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out these two other videos while you're waiting for the next video thank you bye
