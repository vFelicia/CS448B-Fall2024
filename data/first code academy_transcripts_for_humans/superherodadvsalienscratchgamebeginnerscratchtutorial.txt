00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here asia beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - minecraft web programming and many more
00:10 - today we are going to take a look at a
00:12 - fun squash game
00:13 - called super dad
00:18 - father's day is a day of honoring
00:20 - fatherhood and this special day
00:22 - falls on the month of june fathers are
00:25 - superheroes in disguise
00:27 - so in this tutorial we'll be creating a
00:30 - fun game
00:31 - in which a superhero dad has to avoid
00:34 - the aliens that block his path to home
00:38 - the superhero dad will lose a life every
00:41 - time when he touched an
00:42 - alien you'll get only 60 seconds to make
00:46 - sure that the superhero tag
00:48 - survives in the game so let's get
00:50 - started
00:54 - alright so i have opened up an empty
00:56 - scratch
00:57 - project so you can find scratch on by
01:00 - heading onto scratch.mit.edu
01:03 - and i have deleted my default cat spray
01:08 - all right so the first thing i'm going
01:10 - to do is i'm going to add
01:12 - four backdrops so one of this backdrop
01:15 - is going to be
01:16 - my title backdrop the second one would
01:19 - be my game screen in which
01:21 - my game would be running and the third
01:24 - one would be a losing screen
01:27 - in which it will pop up when
01:30 - i lost the game that means if i touched
01:32 - my aliens and lost
01:34 - all my life the screen would be popping
01:37 - up
01:37 - and the other background would be the
01:40 - winning screen
01:41 - so if i managed to make my superhero dad
01:45 - to safely return
01:47 - home within the 60 minute time
01:50 - without losing any of my lives then i
01:53 - would win the game
01:55 - so i'm going to add my four backdrops so
01:57 - you can choose any of the backdrops that
01:59 - you prefer
02:00 - you can add in custom backdrops or use
02:03 - the backdrops that you can find on your
02:05 - scratch library
02:08 - so i'm going to choose for backdrop so
02:18 - all right now i'm going to rename all
02:20 - these backdrops
02:21 - into the backdrops that i have mentioned
02:30 - so ringing my backdrops would help me to
02:33 - identify which backdrops should i use
02:36 - while i cook now i'm going to add my
02:40 - surprise for this game i need 6
02:43 - sprites choose price would be
02:46 - the superhero dead one is going to be
02:49 - the flying superhero dad and the other
02:51 - one
02:52 - is going to be the superhero dad but
02:54 - welcomes your screen
02:57 - next would be two aliens
03:00 - and the other one would be a button
03:03 - which is called the play button
03:05 - and the last one is the hearts
03:08 - so i'm going to add my sprites so from
03:11 - the library i can find my
03:16 - heart my alien
03:20 - so i'm going to choose
03:24 - a nano
03:27 - and i'm going to choose terra
03:30 - so this would be my aliens
03:34 - and next i'm going to add my button
03:39 - all right so next i'm going to add in my
03:43 - human surprise which is the superhero
03:45 - that now the superheroes
03:47 - that sprite you can't find on the
03:49 - scratch library
03:51 - so what we have to do is we have to
03:53 - upload our own
03:54 - custom spread so i'm going to click on
03:58 - the cat icon and click on upload sprite
04:02 - now i'm going to upload this price which
04:04 - i have downloaded
04:05 - over the web so you can find the link to
04:08 - download this price in the description
04:10 - box below
04:11 - alright so i here i have my
04:15 - superhero that's bright so one is the
04:17 - flying dad
04:18 - and the other one is a super dad so i'll
04:21 - be using the
04:23 - super dad sprite first which is going to
04:26 - welcome
04:27 - our player and the flying that will be
04:30 - used
04:31 - on the game so
04:34 - now i need to adjust the sizes of some
04:37 - of these fries
04:39 - so for the heart i'm going to place it
04:43 - up here and i'm going to give the size
04:47 - of
04:48 - 20.
04:54 - now i'm going to change the size to 50
05:03 - and also terra
05:09 - and i'm going to place them on the right
05:11 - corner
05:13 - so i'm going to change the button a
05:15 - little bit so i need to add
05:18 - the text called play so i'm going to the
05:21 - costumes of the button
05:24 - and choose the editor to write a text
05:27 - called play
05:33 - alright so i'm going to start now so i'm
05:36 - going to
05:36 - the stage first and i'm going to
05:40 - drag in the event block so when the
05:41 - green flag is clicked
05:43 - i should start on my first screen
05:47 - which is my title screen
05:52 - when the green flag is clicked i'm going
05:55 - to switch to
06:00 - the title screen next i'm going to use a
06:04 - broadcast block which will tell all
06:07 - my surprise that the game has started
06:10 - and also will let my stage to be
06:13 - changed into my backdrop the game screen
06:16 - alright the message game start is
06:19 - broadcasted
06:20 - by the button play but
06:23 - i'm going to do it on the stage first so
06:26 - i'm going to drag in
06:30 - when i receive message one block
06:33 - and add in a new message called
06:38 - in start
06:43 - then i'm going to switch my backdrop to
06:46 - be
06:50 - game screen so now i'm going to
06:53 - do what happens in the beginning so i'm
06:56 - going to
06:57 - choose my surprise so in the beginning
07:00 - it's my play and my super dad
07:03 - should be shown so i'm going to the
07:07 - super dad sprite and i'm going to drag
07:11 - when the green flag is clicked
07:16 - i'm going to drag in the show block
07:19 - i'm going to use the same block so that
07:21 - my super dad will come to my player
07:25 - and maybe give a little bit of
07:26 - instructions on how to play the game
07:30 - so i'm going to drag a block
07:42 - and
07:47 - all right so what my super dad would be
07:50 - saying in the beginning would be
07:51 - hi i'm silver dad i'm flying back home
07:54 - after battle in mass
07:56 - but dara aliens blocking my path
08:00 - avoid hitting the aliens for 60 seconds
08:04 - press on the play button if you are
08:05 - ready good luck
08:07 - so you can give any message that you
08:11 - like so that your super dad would speak
08:13 - out
08:14 - when the game is starting next i'm going
08:16 - to do the play button
08:20 - so when the green flag is clicked
08:24 - i'll be showing the green button the
08:27 - play button
08:29 - and then i'm going to drag in the event
08:32 - block
08:33 - when the sprite is clay
08:36 - then it's going to send the message call
08:39 - or broadcast a message for
08:41 - gamestop i'm going to drag in the
08:44 - broadcast block
08:46 - and make sure that the game is game
08:48 - stuff
08:50 - so once the button broadcast the
08:53 - message for gamestar so super dad
08:57 - should be headed all right so head to
09:00 - your super dad sprite and i'm going to
09:02 - drag in the black hole
09:04 - when i receive game start
09:09 - i'm going to hide alright now let's head
09:13 - to your stage
09:16 - all right and now once the games
09:19 - is on my game screen i need to run my
09:22 - timer
09:23 - so i'm going to set up a variable
09:28 - so i'm going to make a variable that is
09:30 - called
09:34 - time
09:37 - and i'm going to drag in the block all
09:39 - set
09:42 - time to be
09:50 - so i'm going to give my game 60 seconds
09:53 - next um i need to make sure that my time
09:56 - starts from 60
09:57 - and start on reducing until it reaches
10:00 - to zero
10:02 - so i'm going to try again after a block
10:09 - drag in wait second so every second
10:12 - it's going to change the volume inside
10:15 - my time variable
10:18 - minus 1 and once the time is equal
10:23 - to 0 i should change
10:26 - my backdrop to be my winning screen
10:32 - so i'm going to drag in a conditional
10:38 - and to make my conditional statement
10:42 - i'm going to drag in an equals block
10:47 - so what is going to be equal so if the
10:50 - current value inside my time variable
10:53 - is equal to zero so
10:56 - i'm going to drag time
11:00 - equal to zero i'm going to broadcast a
11:02 - message
11:04 - so i'm going to try again broadcast
11:09 - and the message would be
11:12 - when now once the message called
11:16 - win is broadcasted by the state to
11:19 - sprites
11:20 - and also to the stage itself it should
11:24 - change its backdrop to the winning
11:26 - screen
11:36 - alright so that's to win what about
11:38 - losing
11:39 - so same so i'm going to drag
11:43 - in another when i receive block
11:47 - and this time i'm going to change the
11:50 - new message to be
11:56 - game lost
12:00 - now this message is sent out by the
12:02 - hearts but we'll be taking a look at
12:04 - it later but on the stage i'm going to
12:07 - make the message for when i receive game
12:10 - loss
12:14 - the backdrops it should be changed to
12:18 - the
12:20 - listing screen and i need to make sure
12:22 - that all the sprites
12:23 - are stopped and
12:26 - when the screen changes to the losing
12:29 - screen oh when you
12:31 - stop the game so
12:34 - i'm going to grab go to control and drag
12:37 - in the structural block
12:39 - all right so this would be the code for
12:42 - my
12:43 - stage okay so we have some
12:46 - other sprites that should be working
12:50 - so i'm going to the super dad sprite
12:55 - now the super dark sprite is this
12:58 - sprite that welcomes you
13:01 - so and i'm going to make sure that the
13:03 - super dad is
13:05 - on the left corner a little bit
13:08 - so that is not um overlapping
13:12 - the play button so
13:15 - in order to make sure that the super dad
13:18 - is on this place i'm going to drag
13:21 - the go to x block and put it
13:25 - under my green flag
13:28 - so another instance where the sub attack
13:30 - would be shown
13:32 - would be when we lose the game or when
13:34 - we win the game
13:35 - all right so i'm going to drag in my
13:39 - event blocks so when i receive games law
13:45 - um my super dad would be saying
13:54 - all right so on the game off screen
13:58 - this epidemic is going to say oh no we
14:00 - lost click on the green flag to start
14:03 - the game again
14:06 - but when the super dad hears
14:10 - or receives the message for
14:14 - when it's going to say
14:22 - we won
14:28 - i reached home safely good job
14:32 - all right now what we're going to do is
14:34 - we're going to design
14:36 - our two backdrops the winning backdrop
14:39 - and the losing backdrop
14:40 - so click on stage and go to backdrops
14:45 - so on the losing screen i would add my
14:48 - text
14:48 - call
14:52 - okay
14:57 - and then on my winning screen i would
14:59 - write the text
15:03 - you want
15:07 - all right so next
15:10 - i need to hide my button the play button
15:14 - once it broadcasts the game stuff so
15:18 - i'm going to locks and i'm going to drag
15:20 - in the black hole
15:23 - hi all right so now i'm going to build
15:25 - up my code for the main sprite in the
15:28 - game screen
15:29 - which is the flying tag so let's head to
15:31 - the flying deck
15:33 - all right so in the beginning
15:36 - that means when the green flag is
15:38 - clicked
15:40 - this sprite should be hidden so i'm
15:42 - going to drag in the height lock
15:46 - all right next once i receive the
15:49 - game start message from the button
15:53 - i need to show my flying that on the
15:56 - left side of my screen
15:58 - so i'm going to drag in the block on
16:01 - when i receive
16:03 - make sure that the message is game start
16:07 - all the message that you get from the
16:09 - button
16:12 - and i'm going to drag in go to xny
16:19 - and next i'm going to drag in the show
16:21 - vlog
16:24 - now i'm going to use a costume change
16:27 - in my flying dad it gives the effect
16:30 - that this spread is actually flanked so
16:33 - if you go to the costumes
16:36 - you can see that there is a slime
16:40 - movement or a slight change in the
16:43 - costume of your cape
16:46 - down here if you notice it
16:54 - you like here
16:59 - so i'm going to the code
17:04 - all right so i'm going to drag in a
17:07 - forever block
17:10 - and i'm going to try again next costume
17:14 - and the costume would be changing
17:18 - every 0.2
17:22 - 0.3 i'm going to go with 0.3
17:28 - all right so next i'm going to code my
17:30 - key controls of my flying deck
17:34 - so this would happen in my game screen
17:37 - so i'm going to drag in the
17:40 - block call when the backdrop switches to
17:46 - game screen i'm going to add in my
17:50 - keys so to know which key that
17:53 - the player have used so that is the up
17:57 - down left and right arrow keys
17:59 - i'm going to sense my keys
18:03 - so i'm going to drag for a block
18:06 - and use conditionals to check
18:09 - if my player or if the user have
18:13 - clicked or pressed on a certain key
18:17 - so if you go to sensing
18:22 - and i'm going to drag in key
18:26 - up arrow so when i click on my up arrow
18:30 - key
18:31 - i should change my y
18:35 - the y position i'm going to change
18:38 - one by ten so i'll just duplicate this
18:43 - block
18:44 - and for the down arrow
18:48 - i'll just make it to be minus 10 so that
18:50 - it comes down
18:52 - because the y coordinates are
18:54 - responsible
18:55 - for the up and down position
18:59 - to make sure that the flying that sprite
19:01 - can
19:02 - go forward or come backward i'm going to
19:06 - use
19:06 - my left and right arrow keys
19:09 - so again i'm going to add in
19:14 - a conditional block and my
19:17 - condition would be to sense
19:21 - the right arrow key
19:24 - so for the left and right it would be
19:28 - the x position
19:30 - so i'm going to change drag in the block
19:33 - call change
19:34 - x by 10.
19:38 - and for the right arrow
19:42 - i'm going to make it
19:46 - minus 10 so right is going to be a
19:49 - positive
19:50 - 10 and then left would be
19:53 - negative and then
19:57 - next i'm going to drag in a conditional
20:01 - block
20:04 - all right so in this one i'm going to
20:06 - add in the statement
20:08 - that if the superman or if the flying
20:12 - that
20:13 - sprite is touching either the
20:16 - camera alien or the nano alien it's
20:19 - going to broadcast a message called lost
20:21 - life which is going to hurt by the heart
20:25 - sprite so i'm going to drag in
20:32 - operators
20:35 - and i'm going to drag in the o block so
20:38 - it is either
20:39 - the touching the terra or the nano
20:44 - so to sense whether i'm touching another
20:47 - sprite in scratch
20:49 - we do have a sensing block called
20:52 - touching mouse pointer
20:54 - i'm going to drag in one and put it
20:56 - inside and
20:57 - insert the o block
21:01 - and change it to be camera
21:05 - and on the other side i'm going to make
21:07 - it
21:09 - nano if so next i'm going to
21:12 - make a variable which counts my number
21:15 - of
21:16 - lives so i'm going to make a variable
21:21 - that is called lives
21:25 - all right and then i'm going to change
21:28 - the lives
21:30 - by minus one all right so i'm not going
21:33 - to show my live favorite
21:35 - variable on the screen so i'm going to
21:37 - untick it
21:40 - and then i'm going to broadcast a
21:42 - message called lost
21:44 - life so drag in the broadcast message
21:50 - and make a new message called lost
21:53 - life so this message is heard by your
21:56 - heart strike
21:57 - next i need to give in the last two
22:00 - events for the flying that what happens
22:04 - when it
22:05 - changes the backdrop to the winning or
22:07 - the loosened print
22:08 - so i'm not going to show my flying that
22:11 - sprite because
22:12 - i'm already having another super dad
22:15 - sprite show
22:18 - so i'm going to
22:21 - drag in when i
22:24 - won the backdrop switches to losing
22:28 - screen
22:30 - i'm going to hide
22:35 - and i'll just duplicate the same block
22:37 - and change the
22:39 - screen name to be winning so in both
22:42 - losing and winning screen
22:44 - i'm going to hide my flying deck
22:47 - all right so i have to do a little bit
22:50 - of change
22:50 - for my super dad so i need to show them
22:54 - first
22:55 - on the game loss so when i receive game
23:00 - loss i'm going to show so that
23:02 - it will pop up otherwise it will not
23:05 - show
23:06 - because in the game start screen i'm
23:10 - making it disappear again for the
23:13 - windscreen
23:14 - i need to
23:17 - drag in show block
23:21 - all right so let's do our aliens now
23:26 - so for the alien
23:29 - all right so i'm going to do for one
23:33 - and then later on i can duplicate the
23:35 - same code for the next
23:37 - area so when the green flag is clicked
23:40 - i should hide my alien so i'm going to
23:44 - drag
23:44 - in when the green flag is
23:48 - clicked i'm going to
23:52 - hide now the other backdrops where
23:56 - the alien would be hidden would be the
23:58 - winning screen and also the losing
24:00 - screen
24:01 - so i'm going to try again when the
24:03 - backdrop switches to
24:06 - losing screen it's going to be
24:10 - hide and also in the winning screen
24:15 - it's going to be hidden
24:19 - all right so the only backdrop where you
24:21 - would see your alien would be
24:23 - the game screen so i'm going to add the
24:26 - event
24:28 - when the backdrop switches to the game
24:31 - screen
24:33 - now what i'm going to do here is i'm
24:35 - going to
24:37 - build a code in which it will spawn
24:41 - my aliens on the right side of the
24:44 - screen
24:46 - at different heights
24:50 - so the height would be 150 the range
24:54 - to minus 150 and then
24:58 - it'll keep on moving towards the left
25:02 - side
25:03 - until it touches the flank stands right
25:07 - or the left edge of the screen
25:12 - and then if the alien touches the flying
25:15 - dad
25:16 - then it's going to hatch so then it can
25:19 - respawn
25:20 - back on the right side
25:25 - so this action happens forever until
25:29 - the timer is equal to zero
25:34 - so i'm going to drag a forever block
25:38 - and then drag a show block so i need to
25:41 - make
25:42 - sure that the alien is being
25:45 - appeared on the game screen
25:49 - and then i'm going to motion
25:52 - and grab a go to x and y block
25:56 - so the x is going to be same but i'm
25:59 - going to change the y
26:01 - to be a random number so i'm going to
26:04 - set my range to be
26:07 - 150 to minus
26:10 - 150 so it's going to
26:13 - spawn my aliens at different
26:17 - y position or different heights
26:21 - next i'm going to drag another loop
26:23 - block which is called
26:25 - repeat until so on here i'm going to set
26:29 - up my condition
26:30 - so in order to do that i'm going to drag
26:33 - into
26:34 - all blocks and then good
26:37 - sensing so the things i need to sense
26:42 - is the flying dad
26:45 - and the edge
26:50 - and then i'm going to drag in the mu 10
26:52 - steps
26:53 - long now if i kept it to be moved 10
26:58 - steps
26:59 - then it's going to go to the right side
27:02 - but that's not what we want we know we
27:05 - need
27:06 - to go to the left side so
27:09 - in order to make sure that it goes to
27:11 - the left side
27:12 - i'm going to give the minus
27:16 - symbol so make it minus 10.
27:20 - and then i'm going to drag in
27:24 - an if statement
27:27 - so here the condition would be if i
27:32 - touch
27:34 - flying down i'm going to hide
27:40 - now you might wonder why do i have two
27:43 - touching
27:44 - flying cats can't i bring this
27:47 - height block up here now the reason
27:50 - because
27:52 - repeat until is a loop
27:56 - so if i bring my height block up here
27:59 - then it means that
28:01 - my alien would move 10 steps and height
28:05 - so it'll move only 10 steps it will not
28:07 - go
28:09 - further than that because it's being
28:11 - hidden
28:13 - so that's why i'm going to put them
28:16 - into statements or two
28:20 - code blocks so one is going to be my
28:22 - loop so it keeps on going
28:24 - 10 steps just left side and
28:28 - until it reaches the flying dead or
28:30 - touches the edge
28:33 - and if it touches the flying edge wall
28:36 - it moves towards the left side
28:39 - the alien is going to be hit
28:42 - or disappear all right so i'm going to
28:46 - drag and drop the same code
28:48 - and put it into my other area
28:58 - all right so now we are going to our
29:00 - last sprite which is the hearts
29:03 - all right so in this game i'm going to
29:04 - have three halves
29:06 - so right now i have only one heart so
29:09 - i'm going to duplicate
29:10 - the spring so heart two and heart three
29:15 - so i'm going to rearrange so that heart
29:18 - one
29:19 - is going to be here part two here
29:23 - and heart three all right so the first
29:26 - half that would be lost in the game
29:30 - would be hard three okay so
29:34 - again the hearts would be not shown in
29:36 - the beginning so i'm going to drag
29:41 - when the green flag is clicked i'm going
29:43 - to
29:45 - hide and next when the backdrop switches
29:50 - to the game screen
29:53 - it's going to set up my life variable to
29:56 - be
29:57 - three so set
30:00 - likes to be three because i have only
30:02 - three hearts
30:04 - and then i'm going to set up my position
30:06 - of my
30:07 - third heart so
30:10 - drag in go to x and y block
30:15 - and then drag in the show block
30:20 - so that you can see your third huh next
30:24 - to make sure that a heart is disappeared
30:27 - it will get a message called lost
30:30 - life which is from the flying deck
30:33 - once it touches an area so i'm going to
30:36 - drag in the even block call when i
30:39 - receive
30:42 - lost life i'm going to check whether if
30:45 - my variable
30:46 - is changed so and
30:50 - the flying that we have given the
30:53 - instructions that it will change the
30:56 - or reduce the value inside the lives
30:59 - variable
31:02 - so if it is two so i'm going to drag
31:05 - and conditional block and check
31:10 - the lines variable so if the like is
31:14 - two then i'm going to hide the third
31:19 - heart
31:24 - now the next heart that would be reduced
31:26 - after the third heart would be
31:28 - the second half i'm going to the second
31:30 - half
31:32 - and build the code so in the beginning
31:34 - as usual
31:35 - is hidden so when the green flag is
31:38 - playing
31:39 - i'm going to drag in the height block
31:44 - and when it's on the game screen
31:48 - i'm going to set up my position so
31:52 - since it's this is the first part that
31:55 - is going to be
31:56 - reduced i don't need to set my variable
31:59 - back to 2
32:00 - because it will be auto updated
32:04 - so i'll just add in my position
32:07 - to go to x and y and drag in the
32:11 - show block all right so once i've
32:14 - received the message
32:15 - called lost life
32:20 - again the player would on the player
32:22 - code it will reduce
32:24 - the or update your life variable value
32:29 - so i need to check whether it is one
32:32 - because i already have three in the
32:35 - beginning
32:36 - and if i lose one it's going to be two
32:40 - now for the second half it's going to be
32:42 - 1.
32:43 - so if the volume
32:48 - inside is going to be
32:52 - equal to 1 then
32:55 - it's going to high so that i have only
32:57 - one heart left
33:01 - now the last one would be the first
33:04 - heart now i'm going to
33:08 - do some repetition of the two so when
33:10 - the green flag is
33:11 - clicked i'm going to hide
33:16 - and when the backdrop switches to
33:21 - the game screen i'm going to the
33:25 - set the position and i'm going to drag
33:28 - in the show block
33:32 - and then lastly if it receives
33:36 - the game last night
33:40 - and if the value inside it
33:44 - or inside the light variable is equal to
33:47 - zero
33:48 - so one is here the last heart should be
33:52 - zero so
33:55 - if life
33:58 - variable is equal to zero
34:02 - i'm going to hide
34:05 - and then i'm going to broadcast a
34:08 - message so the last heart
34:09 - is responsible to broadcast the message
34:13 - to all the sprites
34:14 - and to the stage that the game is over
34:20 - so i'm going to drag again go to events
34:23 - so we already made a broadcast message
34:28 - on the stage once we did the stage
34:31 - so i'm going to drag in the broadcast
34:33 - message and
34:36 - put in the block called
34:40 - game lost all right so let's take a look
34:43 - at
34:44 - the codes and then we can start the game
34:47 - so this would be the code for the stage
34:55 - this would be the code for the play
34:57 - button
34:59 - this would be the code for the flying
35:02 - dan
35:08 - this would be the code for the alien
35:12 - my nano alien and the terra
35:16 - alien they all have the same code blocks
35:22 - and this would be the code block for my
35:26 - flying dad which is the main sprite
35:30 - in my game
35:34 - and then my hearts starting from
35:37 - part three
35:43 - three two one we're starting from part
35:47 - three
35:51 - then start part two
35:56 - and finally the hot one
36:00 - the last half
36:06 - all right so we have completed our
36:08 - scratch super dad game
36:10 - so let's try it out
37:29 - so that's all for today i hope you
37:31 - enjoyed this project

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to our channel here asia beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch minecraft web programming and many more today we are going to take a look at a fun squash game called super dad father's day is a day of honoring fatherhood and this special day falls on the month of june fathers are superheroes in disguise so in this tutorial we'll be creating a fun game in which a superhero dad has to avoid the aliens that block his path to home the superhero dad will lose a life every time when he touched an alien you'll get only 60 seconds to make sure that the superhero tag survives in the game so let's get started alright so i have opened up an empty scratch project so you can find scratch on by heading onto scratch.mit.edu and i have deleted my default cat spray all right so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to add four backdrops so one of this backdrop is going to be my title backdrop the second one would be my game screen in which my game would be running and the third one would be a losing screen in which it will pop up when i lost the game that means if i touched my aliens and lost all my life the screen would be popping up and the other background would be the winning screen so if i managed to make my superhero dad to safely return home within the 60 minute time without losing any of my lives then i would win the game so i'm going to add my four backdrops so you can choose any of the backdrops that you prefer you can add in custom backdrops or use the backdrops that you can find on your scratch library so i'm going to choose for backdrop so all right now i'm going to rename all these backdrops into the backdrops that i have mentioned so ringing my backdrops would help me to identify which backdrops should i use while i cook now i'm going to add my surprise for this game i need 6 sprites choose price would be the superhero dead one is going to be the flying superhero dad and the other one is going to be the superhero dad but welcomes your screen next would be two aliens and the other one would be a button which is called the play button and the last one is the hearts so i'm going to add my sprites so from the library i can find my heart my alien so i'm going to choose a nano and i'm going to choose terra so this would be my aliens and next i'm going to add my button all right so next i'm going to add in my human surprise which is the superhero that now the superheroes that sprite you can't find on the scratch library so what we have to do is we have to upload our own custom spread so i'm going to click on the cat icon and click on upload sprite now i'm going to upload this price which i have downloaded over the web so you can find the link to download this price in the description box below alright so i here i have my superhero that's bright so one is the flying dad and the other one is a super dad so i'll be using the super dad sprite first which is going to welcome our player and the flying that will be used on the game so now i need to adjust the sizes of some of these fries so for the heart i'm going to place it up here and i'm going to give the size of 20. now i'm going to change the size to 50 and also terra and i'm going to place them on the right corner so i'm going to change the button a little bit so i need to add the text called play so i'm going to the costumes of the button and choose the editor to write a text called play alright so i'm going to start now so i'm going to the stage first and i'm going to drag in the event block so when the green flag is clicked i should start on my first screen which is my title screen when the green flag is clicked i'm going to switch to the title screen next i'm going to use a broadcast block which will tell all my surprise that the game has started and also will let my stage to be changed into my backdrop the game screen alright the message game start is broadcasted by the button play but i'm going to do it on the stage first so i'm going to drag in when i receive message one block and add in a new message called in start then i'm going to switch my backdrop to be game screen so now i'm going to do what happens in the beginning so i'm going to choose my surprise so in the beginning it's my play and my super dad should be shown so i'm going to the super dad sprite and i'm going to drag when the green flag is clicked i'm going to drag in the show block i'm going to use the same block so that my super dad will come to my player and maybe give a little bit of instructions on how to play the game so i'm going to drag a block and all right so what my super dad would be saying in the beginning would be hi i'm silver dad i'm flying back home after battle in mass but dara aliens blocking my path avoid hitting the aliens for 60 seconds press on the play button if you are ready good luck so you can give any message that you like so that your super dad would speak out when the game is starting next i'm going to do the play button so when the green flag is clicked i'll be showing the green button the play button and then i'm going to drag in the event block when the sprite is clay then it's going to send the message call or broadcast a message for gamestop i'm going to drag in the broadcast block and make sure that the game is game stuff so once the button broadcast the message for gamestar so super dad should be headed all right so head to your super dad sprite and i'm going to drag in the black hole when i receive game start i'm going to hide alright now let's head to your stage all right and now once the games is on my game screen i need to run my timer so i'm going to set up a variable so i'm going to make a variable that is called time and i'm going to drag in the block all set time to be so i'm going to give my game 60 seconds next um i need to make sure that my time starts from 60 and start on reducing until it reaches to zero so i'm going to try again after a block drag in wait second so every second it's going to change the volume inside my time variable minus 1 and once the time is equal to 0 i should change my backdrop to be my winning screen so i'm going to drag in a conditional and to make my conditional statement i'm going to drag in an equals block so what is going to be equal so if the current value inside my time variable is equal to zero so i'm going to drag time equal to zero i'm going to broadcast a message so i'm going to try again broadcast and the message would be when now once the message called win is broadcasted by the state to sprites and also to the stage itself it should change its backdrop to the winning screen alright so that's to win what about losing so same so i'm going to drag in another when i receive block and this time i'm going to change the new message to be game lost now this message is sent out by the hearts but we'll be taking a look at it later but on the stage i'm going to make the message for when i receive game loss the backdrops it should be changed to the listing screen and i need to make sure that all the sprites are stopped and when the screen changes to the losing screen oh when you stop the game so i'm going to grab go to control and drag in the structural block all right so this would be the code for my stage okay so we have some other sprites that should be working so i'm going to the super dad sprite now the super dark sprite is this sprite that welcomes you so and i'm going to make sure that the super dad is on the left corner a little bit so that is not um overlapping the play button so in order to make sure that the super dad is on this place i'm going to drag the go to x block and put it under my green flag so another instance where the sub attack would be shown would be when we lose the game or when we win the game all right so i'm going to drag in my event blocks so when i receive games law um my super dad would be saying all right so on the game off screen this epidemic is going to say oh no we lost click on the green flag to start the game again but when the super dad hears or receives the message for when it's going to say we won i reached home safely good job all right now what we're going to do is we're going to design our two backdrops the winning backdrop and the losing backdrop so click on stage and go to backdrops so on the losing screen i would add my text call okay and then on my winning screen i would write the text you want all right so next i need to hide my button the play button once it broadcasts the game stuff so i'm going to locks and i'm going to drag in the black hole hi all right so now i'm going to build up my code for the main sprite in the game screen which is the flying tag so let's head to the flying deck all right so in the beginning that means when the green flag is clicked this sprite should be hidden so i'm going to drag in the height lock all right next once i receive the game start message from the button i need to show my flying that on the left side of my screen so i'm going to drag in the block on when i receive make sure that the message is game start all the message that you get from the button and i'm going to drag in go to xny and next i'm going to drag in the show vlog now i'm going to use a costume change in my flying dad it gives the effect that this spread is actually flanked so if you go to the costumes you can see that there is a slime movement or a slight change in the costume of your cape down here if you notice it you like here so i'm going to the code all right so i'm going to drag in a forever block and i'm going to try again next costume and the costume would be changing every 0.2 0.3 i'm going to go with 0.3 all right so next i'm going to code my key controls of my flying deck so this would happen in my game screen so i'm going to drag in the block call when the backdrop switches to game screen i'm going to add in my keys so to know which key that the player have used so that is the up down left and right arrow keys i'm going to sense my keys so i'm going to drag for a block and use conditionals to check if my player or if the user have clicked or pressed on a certain key so if you go to sensing and i'm going to drag in key up arrow so when i click on my up arrow key i should change my y the y position i'm going to change one by ten so i'll just duplicate this block and for the down arrow i'll just make it to be minus 10 so that it comes down because the y coordinates are responsible for the up and down position to make sure that the flying that sprite can go forward or come backward i'm going to use my left and right arrow keys so again i'm going to add in a conditional block and my condition would be to sense the right arrow key so for the left and right it would be the x position so i'm going to change drag in the block call change x by 10. and for the right arrow i'm going to make it minus 10 so right is going to be a positive 10 and then left would be negative and then next i'm going to drag in a conditional block all right so in this one i'm going to add in the statement that if the superman or if the flying that sprite is touching either the camera alien or the nano alien it's going to broadcast a message called lost life which is going to hurt by the heart sprite so i'm going to drag in operators and i'm going to drag in the o block so it is either the touching the terra or the nano so to sense whether i'm touching another sprite in scratch we do have a sensing block called touching mouse pointer i'm going to drag in one and put it inside and insert the o block and change it to be camera and on the other side i'm going to make it nano if so next i'm going to make a variable which counts my number of lives so i'm going to make a variable that is called lives all right and then i'm going to change the lives by minus one all right so i'm not going to show my live favorite variable on the screen so i'm going to untick it and then i'm going to broadcast a message called lost life so drag in the broadcast message and make a new message called lost life so this message is heard by your heart strike next i need to give in the last two events for the flying that what happens when it changes the backdrop to the winning or the loosened print so i'm not going to show my flying that sprite because i'm already having another super dad sprite show so i'm going to drag in when i won the backdrop switches to losing screen i'm going to hide and i'll just duplicate the same block and change the screen name to be winning so in both losing and winning screen i'm going to hide my flying deck all right so i have to do a little bit of change for my super dad so i need to show them first on the game loss so when i receive game loss i'm going to show so that it will pop up otherwise it will not show because in the game start screen i'm making it disappear again for the windscreen i need to drag in show block all right so let's do our aliens now so for the alien all right so i'm going to do for one and then later on i can duplicate the same code for the next area so when the green flag is clicked i should hide my alien so i'm going to drag in when the green flag is clicked i'm going to hide now the other backdrops where the alien would be hidden would be the winning screen and also the losing screen so i'm going to try again when the backdrop switches to losing screen it's going to be hide and also in the winning screen it's going to be hidden all right so the only backdrop where you would see your alien would be the game screen so i'm going to add the event when the backdrop switches to the game screen now what i'm going to do here is i'm going to build a code in which it will spawn my aliens on the right side of the screen at different heights so the height would be 150 the range to minus 150 and then it'll keep on moving towards the left side until it touches the flank stands right or the left edge of the screen and then if the alien touches the flying dad then it's going to hatch so then it can respawn back on the right side so this action happens forever until the timer is equal to zero so i'm going to drag a forever block and then drag a show block so i need to make sure that the alien is being appeared on the game screen and then i'm going to motion and grab a go to x and y block so the x is going to be same but i'm going to change the y to be a random number so i'm going to set my range to be 150 to minus 150 so it's going to spawn my aliens at different y position or different heights next i'm going to drag another loop block which is called repeat until so on here i'm going to set up my condition so in order to do that i'm going to drag into all blocks and then good sensing so the things i need to sense is the flying dad and the edge and then i'm going to drag in the mu 10 steps long now if i kept it to be moved 10 steps then it's going to go to the right side but that's not what we want we know we need to go to the left side so in order to make sure that it goes to the left side i'm going to give the minus symbol so make it minus 10. and then i'm going to drag in an if statement so here the condition would be if i touch flying down i'm going to hide now you might wonder why do i have two touching flying cats can't i bring this height block up here now the reason because repeat until is a loop so if i bring my height block up here then it means that my alien would move 10 steps and height so it'll move only 10 steps it will not go further than that because it's being hidden so that's why i'm going to put them into statements or two code blocks so one is going to be my loop so it keeps on going 10 steps just left side and until it reaches the flying dead or touches the edge and if it touches the flying edge wall it moves towards the left side the alien is going to be hit or disappear all right so i'm going to drag and drop the same code and put it into my other area all right so now we are going to our last sprite which is the hearts all right so in this game i'm going to have three halves so right now i have only one heart so i'm going to duplicate the spring so heart two and heart three so i'm going to rearrange so that heart one is going to be here part two here and heart three all right so the first half that would be lost in the game would be hard three okay so again the hearts would be not shown in the beginning so i'm going to drag when the green flag is clicked i'm going to hide and next when the backdrop switches to the game screen it's going to set up my life variable to be three so set likes to be three because i have only three hearts and then i'm going to set up my position of my third heart so drag in go to x and y block and then drag in the show block so that you can see your third huh next to make sure that a heart is disappeared it will get a message called lost life which is from the flying deck once it touches an area so i'm going to drag in the even block call when i receive lost life i'm going to check whether if my variable is changed so and the flying that we have given the instructions that it will change the or reduce the value inside the lives variable so if it is two so i'm going to drag and conditional block and check the lines variable so if the like is two then i'm going to hide the third heart now the next heart that would be reduced after the third heart would be the second half i'm going to the second half and build the code so in the beginning as usual is hidden so when the green flag is playing i'm going to drag in the height block and when it's on the game screen i'm going to set up my position so since it's this is the first part that is going to be reduced i don't need to set my variable back to 2 because it will be auto updated so i'll just add in my position to go to x and y and drag in the show block all right so once i've received the message called lost life again the player would on the player code it will reduce the or update your life variable value so i need to check whether it is one because i already have three in the beginning and if i lose one it's going to be two now for the second half it's going to be 1. so if the volume inside is going to be equal to 1 then it's going to high so that i have only one heart left now the last one would be the first heart now i'm going to do some repetition of the two so when the green flag is clicked i'm going to hide and when the backdrop switches to the game screen i'm going to the set the position and i'm going to drag in the show block and then lastly if it receives the game last night and if the value inside it or inside the light variable is equal to zero so one is here the last heart should be zero so if life variable is equal to zero i'm going to hide and then i'm going to broadcast a message so the last heart is responsible to broadcast the message to all the sprites and to the stage that the game is over so i'm going to drag again go to events so we already made a broadcast message on the stage once we did the stage so i'm going to drag in the broadcast message and put in the block called game lost all right so let's take a look at the codes and then we can start the game so this would be the code for the stage this would be the code for the play button this would be the code for the flying dan this would be the code for the alien my nano alien and the terra alien they all have the same code blocks and this would be the code block for my flying dad which is the main sprite in my game and then my hearts starting from part three three two one we're starting from part three then start part two and finally the hot one the last half all right so we have completed our scratch super dad game so let's try it out so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed this project don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out these other two videos here while we are waiting for the next video thank you bye
