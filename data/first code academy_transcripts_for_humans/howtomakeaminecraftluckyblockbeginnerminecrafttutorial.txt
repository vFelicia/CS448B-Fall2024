00:00 - hello everyone so today we'll be making
00:02 - a lucky block in minecraft using
00:04 - m creator and in this project
00:07 - we'll have a block where you break it
00:09 - and it will either give you
00:10 - one of two options you'll get a diamond
00:12 - armor set
00:13 - or a diamond sword with a tnt depending
00:16 - on a random number
00:17 - so let's begin making this project so
00:20 - now i'll be showing you a demo of the
00:22 - lucky block
00:24 - so what's going to happen first is i'm
00:25 - going to take out a lucky block from my
00:27 - inventory
00:27 - i'm going to place it on the grass so
00:30 - let's begin i'm going to press e
00:32 - i've been lucky and then i'm going to
00:34 - take out the block
00:35 - and place it here so once
00:39 - i have this block i'm going to place it
00:40 - on the grass over here so i'll place
00:42 - one here there's one over here one over
00:45 - here
00:46 - and then another one here so i've placed
00:48 - four on the graphs
00:49 - over here so what's gonna happen is
00:53 - it's gonna randomly pick a number from
00:55 - zero to one
00:57 - so if it's bigger than 0.5 then it's
00:59 - going to say it's more than 50 percent
01:01 - otherwise if it's less than 0.5 it's
01:03 - going to say it's less than 50
01:05 - so the items that i'll get is a diamond
01:07 - sword and a tnt
01:09 - or i'll get a diamond armor set which
01:11 - includes a diamond helmet
01:13 - a diamond leggings and diamond chestnut
01:16 - so right now i'm going to
01:19 - remove this by using clear i'm just
01:22 - going to use
01:23 - my hand i'm going to break this so here
01:26 - as you see in the chat it says that i
01:28 - have an armor and pnt and it says more
01:30 - than 50
01:32 - now i'll just remove this then let me
01:35 - break this
01:36 - so i got a number that's bigger than 0.5
01:39 - i break this here again i get the same
01:41 - thing bigger than 0.5
01:43 - if i break this now it says it's lower
01:45 - than 0.5 and you can see here i get my
01:47 - diamond armor
01:49 - so i get all these items then i'll break
01:51 - the last one
01:52 - so this is bigger than 0.5
01:56 - more than 50 so this is how the
01:59 - random block is going to be made and we
02:01 - can choose whatever we want to add
02:04 - in these boxes we'll be beginning our
02:06 - project
02:07 - so first open your google chrome or
02:10 - safari window and head to pixelart.com
02:13 - and start a new drone once you're there
02:16 - make sure that
02:17 - you change your height to 16 in your
02:19 - width to 60
02:21 - and click on your drawing over here
02:24 - and then click ok
02:27 - once you're on the canvas you can start
02:30 - drawing your
02:31 - lucky block so what i like to do is i
02:34 - like to use the square tool
02:37 - and then i click on any color over here
02:40 - which i want so say i pick on blue i can
02:43 - just
02:44 - make a little square here and then
02:48 - i can see that i've taken one two three
02:50 - four five
02:51 - let me take the same amount of space
02:53 - here
02:57 - then i will do the same thing here
03:04 - so you can depends on how you want it
03:08 - if you think you don't like it you can
03:12 - remove it like this with the eraser tool
03:16 - and then just select another color so
03:19 - i'm gonna maybe
03:20 - use red
03:28 - and then you can use a paint tool and
03:30 - color it inside so maybe i'll pick this
03:32 - color
03:35 - and then for this you can pick any other
03:37 - color you like
03:41 - so there this is my lucky block then if
03:43 - you want to write
03:45 - some sort of writing you can do the same
03:47 - you can go select a color
03:49 - maybe this and i think i'll just write a
03:52 - simple hi next i want to download this
04:01 - image
04:01 - click on download and then i click on
04:04 - download png
04:05 - so let's save to my computer over here
04:09 - so in the next part i want to open my
04:11 - amp creator and
04:13 - start making my lucky block
04:16 - so now that my amp creator is open i
04:18 - want to start making my lucky block
04:19 - i click on plus and then i click over
04:22 - here
04:23 - at blocks then i'm going to call this
04:25 - lucky
04:26 - lock then create a new block
04:31 - now i'm created at this stage to add in
04:33 - the image for my block
04:35 - so here i can click on bottom main
04:38 - and then here i can click import so once
04:42 - i click that it shows me a window as to
04:44 - where do i want to
04:46 - get the image from
04:50 - click open and if there's a file that
04:52 - already exists with the same file name
04:54 - i can just change this to lucky block
04:58 - drawn click ok
05:01 - then i have it here i can click on this
05:03 - and i've selected it here
05:06 - and i can do the same for this this
05:12 - this here
05:15 - this here and this here again
05:20 - so once that's done i won't have to edit
05:23 - anything
05:24 - here go to properties i can leave this
05:26 - alone
05:28 - same thing for advanced properties same
05:31 - thing for tile entity
05:33 - same thing for the energy and fluid
05:34 - storage
05:36 - and then triggers now triggers is where
05:39 - i want to run
05:39 - a procedure i'm going to run it under
05:42 - the part where the block is destroyed by
05:44 - the player
05:45 - so here i'm going to click on plus and
05:48 - this is going to be called lucky block
05:50 - block destroyed by player
05:51 - then i click on create procedure so
05:55 - right now what i want to do is i want to
05:58 - click
05:59 - and use a variable so over here it says
06:02 - local variables i can click on plus
06:05 - i can change this to a number and i'm
06:08 - going to call this
06:09 - random click okay
06:12 - so now i have a block here that says
06:14 - custom variables i'm going to click on
06:16 - it
06:17 - take out set local random
06:20 - and then here what i'm going to do is
06:22 - i'm going to click on
06:25 - the math block and then we have random 0
06:28 - 1. so what this does is it picks a
06:30 - random number between 0
06:32 - and 1. next what i'm going to do
06:35 - is i'm going to take out a conditional
06:37 - so that will be
06:38 - under the flow control here and i'll
06:41 - take out a
06:42 - if then so what i'm going to do now
06:45 - is i'm going to click on a
06:49 - logic block and i should be able to find
06:51 - the more than so i'm going to click on
06:53 - this
06:54 - and then here is the more than block i'm
06:57 - going to place this here
06:59 - now what i want to do in this part is i
07:02 - want to get the information
07:04 - of what the number is in random do that
07:07 - i'm going to click on my custom variable
07:09 - and i'm going to use get
07:10 - local random this block will help me get
07:13 - the information
07:14 - now i want to check if the number is
07:16 - higher than a 0.5
07:19 - so i'm going to click on math take out
07:21 - the zero block here
07:23 - put it inside and change this to 0.5
07:29 - after that's done i can now spawn in
07:31 - anything i like here i'm going to click
07:33 - on
07:33 - word management then we're going to find
07:36 - a block that says spawn
07:38 - gem so i'm going to take this out place
07:40 - this here
07:41 - and make a copy and then another copy
07:45 - so here and here and then one more
07:48 - here so
07:51 - now what i'm gonna add inside is
07:54 - this here
07:58 - i'm gonna add in a sword so i'll click
08:00 - on a diamond sword
08:02 - i want to give the diamond sword to the
08:04 - player if when they break the block
08:06 - it's bigger the number picked is bigger
08:08 - than 0.5
08:10 - and then here if the number is smaller
08:11 - than that then i just want to give them
08:13 - a tnt or instead if you want
08:17 - you can give them a armor set so you can
08:20 - put
08:20 - in diamond then you'll see here the
08:24 - helmet
08:33 - so what happens here is when you break
08:36 - the block
08:37 - if the number you get is bigger than 0.5
08:40 - you'll be given a sword
08:42 - but when you break the block and that
08:43 - number is smaller than 0.5 then you'll
08:45 - be given the armor set of a
08:47 - helmet chest plate and leggings and we
08:51 - can even add in
08:54 - a message here
08:58 - so you can have this send message
09:02 - and then put these two blocks here
09:06 - and add in another bunch of blocks here
09:13 - so you can see here you get
09:17 - a diamond and then this you can say
09:24 - higher than 50 percent
09:28 - here you can say you get a
09:31 - diamond on set
09:34 - then here you can say lower than
09:38 - 50 and that is our procedure and then we
09:42 - can save this
09:44 - here so once that's in here when you
09:47 - break the block this is what will happen
09:49 - then we'll click save
09:50 - mod so right now we have our procedure
09:54 - and then we have our blocks so i'm going
09:58 - to show you what it looks like when we
09:59 - test out the project
10:01 - once that's done you wait for this
10:03 - console to load
10:04 - you can monitor the procedure here
10:08 - and wait for it to load here then
10:11 - once that's done you can open it by
10:15 - clicking on play
10:17 - then you can click back on console to
10:19 - monitor how it's
10:20 - running and then we'll wait for
10:23 - minecraft to load up
10:34 - after minecraft is loaded you can click
10:36 - on single player
10:38 - and then i'll just delete this and start
10:41 - a new world
10:42 - make sure you're in creative mode click
10:44 - on create new world
10:49 - so once we're here we'll begin by going
10:52 - to
10:53 - a plane area click on e and then
10:56 - click on search items and find
10:59 - our lucky block
11:02 - here so i'm gonna place
11:06 - it here so one two three
11:10 - and then four hello piggy then four over
11:13 - here
11:15 - so we have these four blocks and then we
11:17 - have a pig
11:19 - so the pig will be roaming around while
11:22 - we
11:22 - break these blocks so let's begin so
11:24 - break one
11:25 - we got lower than 50 we got a diamond
11:27 - armor set
11:28 - okay nice so i'll just clear everything
11:31 - inside slash clear
11:33 - now let's break the second one again we
11:35 - get a diamond armor set
11:37 - so this time it's still less than 50 so
11:39 - let's try clearing it again
11:41 - let's break this so we got now higher
11:43 - than 50. we got a sword
11:45 - right let's break the last one get
11:48 - another sword
11:50 - so it just depends on what number is
11:52 - picked and
11:53 - depending on that you get these items
11:55 - inside so higher than 50 we get a sword
11:58 - more than 50 percent we get a diamond if

hello everyone so today we'll be making a lucky block in minecraft using m creator and in this project we'll have a block where you break it and it will either give you one of two options you'll get a diamond armor set or a diamond sword with a tnt depending on a random number so let's begin making this project so now i'll be showing you a demo of the lucky block so what's going to happen first is i'm going to take out a lucky block from my inventory i'm going to place it on the grass so let's begin i'm going to press e i've been lucky and then i'm going to take out the block and place it here so once i have this block i'm going to place it on the grass over here so i'll place one here there's one over here one over here and then another one here so i've placed four on the graphs over here so what's gonna happen is it's gonna randomly pick a number from zero to one so if it's bigger than 0.5 then it's going to say it's more than 50 percent otherwise if it's less than 0.5 it's going to say it's less than 50 so the items that i'll get is a diamond sword and a tnt or i'll get a diamond armor set which includes a diamond helmet a diamond leggings and diamond chestnut so right now i'm going to remove this by using clear i'm just going to use my hand i'm going to break this so here as you see in the chat it says that i have an armor and pnt and it says more than 50 now i'll just remove this then let me break this so i got a number that's bigger than 0.5 i break this here again i get the same thing bigger than 0.5 if i break this now it says it's lower than 0.5 and you can see here i get my diamond armor so i get all these items then i'll break the last one so this is bigger than 0.5 more than 50 so this is how the random block is going to be made and we can choose whatever we want to add in these boxes we'll be beginning our project so first open your google chrome or safari window and head to pixelart.com and start a new drone once you're there make sure that you change your height to 16 in your width to 60 and click on your drawing over here and then click ok once you're on the canvas you can start drawing your lucky block so what i like to do is i like to

just select another color so i'm gonna maybe use red and then you can use a paint tool and color it inside so maybe i'll pick this color and then for this you can pick any other color you like so there this is my lucky block then if you want to write some sort of writing you can do the same you can go select a color maybe this and i think i'll just write a simple hi next i want to download this image click on download and then i click on download png so let's save to my computer over here so in the next part i want to open my amp creator and start making my lucky block so now that my amp creator is open i want to start making my lucky block i click on plus and then i click over here at blocks then i'm going to call this lucky lock then create a new block now i'm created at this stage to add in the image for my block so here i can click on bottom main and then here i can click import so once i click that it shows me a window as to where do i want to get the image from click open and if there's a file that already exists with the same file name i can just change this to lucky block drawn click ok then i have it here i can click on this and i've selected it here and i can do the same for this this this here this here and this here again so once that's done i won't have to edit anything here go to properties i can leave this alone same thing for advanced properties same thing for tile entity same thing for the energy and fluid storage and then triggers now triggers is where i want to run a procedure i'm going to run it under the part where the block is destroyed by the player so here i'm going to click on plus and this is going to be called lucky block block destroyed by player then i click on create procedure so right now what i want to do is i want to click and use a variable so over here it says local variables i can click on plus i can change this to a number and i'm going to call this random click okay so now i have a block here that says custom variables i'm going to click on it take out set local random and then here what i'm going to do is i'm going to click on the math block and then we have random 0 1. so what this does is it picks a random number between 0 and 1. next what i'm going to do is i'm going to take out a conditional so that will be under the flow control here and i'll take out a if then so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to click on a logic block and i should be able to find the more than so i'm going to click on this and then here is the more than block i'm going to place this here now what i want to do in this part is i want to get the information of what the number is in random do that i'm going to click on my custom variable and i'm going to use get local random this block will help me get the information now i want to check if the number is higher than a 0.5 so i'm going to click on math take out the zero block here put it inside and change this to 0.5 after that's done i can now spawn in anything i like here i'm going to click on word management then we're going to find a block that says spawn gem so i'm going to take this out place this here and make a copy and then another copy so here and here and then one more here so now what i'm gonna add inside is this here i'm gonna add in a sword so i'll click on a diamond sword i want to give the diamond sword to the player if when they break the block it's bigger the number picked is bigger than 0.5 and then here if the number is smaller than that then i just want to give them a tnt or instead if you want you can give them a armor set so you can put in diamond then you'll see here the helmet so what happens here is when you break the block if the number you get is bigger than 0.5 you'll be given a sword but when you break the block and that number is smaller than 0.5 then you'll be given the armor set of a helmet chest plate and leggings and we can even add in a message here so you can have this send message and then put these two blocks here and add in another bunch of blocks here so you can see here you get a diamond and then this you can say higher than 50 percent here you can say you get a diamond on set then here you can say lower than 50 and that is our procedure and then we can save this here so once that's in here when you break the block this is what will happen then we'll click save mod so right now we have our procedure and then we have our blocks so i'm going to show you what it looks like when we test out the project once that's done you wait for this console to load you can monitor the procedure here and wait for it to load here then once that's done you can open it by clicking on play then you can click back on console to monitor how it's running and then we'll wait for minecraft to load up after minecraft is loaded you can click on single player and then i'll just delete this and start a new world make sure you're in creative mode click on create new world so once we're here we'll begin by going to a plane area click on e and then click on search items and find our lucky block here so i'm gonna place it here so one two three and then four hello piggy then four over here so we have these four blocks and then we have a pig so the pig will be roaming around while we break these blocks so let's begin so break one we got lower than 50 we got a diamond armor set okay nice so i'll just clear everything inside slash clear now let's break the second one again we get a diamond armor set so this time it's still less than 50 so let's try clearing it again let's break this so we got now higher than 50. we got a sword right let's break the last one get another sword so it just depends on what number is picked and depending on that you get these items inside so higher than 50 we get a sword more than 50 percent we get a diamond if you enjoyed this tutorial please make sure to like share and subscribe to first code academy on youtube for more fun filled tutorials such as
