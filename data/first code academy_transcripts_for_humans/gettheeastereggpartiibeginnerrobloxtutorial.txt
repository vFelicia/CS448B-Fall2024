00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share picking a friendly
00:05 - tutorial on minecraft
00:07 - roblox web programming and many more
00:10 - today we are going to take a look at
00:12 - part 2 of our roblox game called
00:15 - get the easter egg so in part one of
00:19 - this tutorial
00:20 - we learn how to design the game
00:22 - environment of the game which is
00:24 - a jungle and then we created our spawn
00:28 - locations
00:29 - and our easter egg so in this project
00:32 - i'll be using the code kingdom platform
00:35 - to make
00:36 - three code files one code file would be
00:39 - for the platforms to change
00:41 - colors and also to explode randomly when
00:44 - they turn into red
00:46 - the second chord file would be for the
00:48 - player
00:50 - to time how long the play is alive and
00:53 - also
00:54 - the last code would be for the a to
00:57 - indicate that the game is over when the
01:00 - player
01:00 - catches the easter egg so let's get
01:03 - started
01:04 - for the second part of the tutorial i'm
01:06 - going to the code kingdom platform
01:09 - so the first thing i need to do before i
01:12 - code is to make sure that my studio is
01:15 - online so how to do this is that
01:19 - i'll just open up roblox studio where i
01:21 - have my game open up
01:24 - and i'm going to click on plugins
01:28 - and i'm going to click on unlink edit
01:30 - option
01:34 - next i'm going to head back to my
01:38 - editor so then it will pop up a message
01:42 - asking for connection request from your
01:44 - roblox studio so i'm going to click on
01:46 - yes
01:49 - and then i'm going to click on link
01:52 - alright so now it is online
01:56 - now we can start coding in the first
01:58 - part of the tutorial i made a file
02:00 - called platform
02:02 - so this would be the first code file
02:06 - which i'll make
02:08 - to my platforms the green color pads
02:11 - to make them to turn their colors
02:14 - randomly
02:16 - so first thing is i'm going to click on
02:18 - make a method
02:19 - so i'm going to click on add method
02:22 - and click on on create
02:27 - all right so next from the code library
02:30 - i'm going to drag
02:31 - a while loop so i'm going to
02:35 - drag a while loop
02:40 - and then i'm going to change the
02:42 - condition of this
02:43 - while loop to be true
02:48 - so what happens is that so when they are
02:51 - being created
02:52 - it's going to check if color of the
02:56 - platform
02:56 - is red or green
02:59 - so i'm going to drag in a weight
03:04 - block
03:07 - and change the time to be one second
03:11 - so that the colors keep on changing
03:14 - every one second
03:16 - next i'm going to drag in an
03:19 - if then statement
03:24 - and change the condition to be
03:28 - left equals right
03:32 - all right so the condition is to check
03:34 - the colors
03:36 - so i'm going to make my condition to
03:39 - make that if the platform is
03:42 - red color it's going to create an
03:45 - explosion
03:47 - so i'm going to make my left side
03:52 - to be self color so i'm going to build a
03:56 - block
03:58 - so self
04:03 - color then click on place
04:08 - and then i'm going to choose the red
04:10 - color so i'm going to click on the right
04:12 - slot and
04:14 - go down under types
04:18 - and then you'll see an option called
04:20 - color 3.
04:21 - i'm going to click on that and choose
04:24 - red color
04:26 - next to make the platforms to be
04:29 - explosive
04:30 - i'm going to drag in the code block call
04:33 - create
04:36 - and then i'm going to change it to be
04:39 - explosion
04:40 - so that the platforms explode when they
04:43 - turn into red color
04:46 - now once they turn into red color after
04:49 - they
04:49 - explode they have to turn back to the
04:51 - green color so that it keeps on
04:54 - repeating the color change between red
04:57 - and green
04:58 - so next i'm going to under the if
05:01 - statement
05:02 - uh i'm going to drag in
05:05 - and equals object equals update block
05:11 - and place it under the explosion
05:14 - code block and then what i'm going to do
05:17 - next is on the call on the code library
05:21 - i'm going to find the color block
05:25 - and i'm going to drag in and place it
05:27 - inside the object
05:30 - and the update would be turned back into
05:33 - green color
05:35 - so when you're choosing the green color
05:37 - choose a green color that is
05:39 - similar to the green color that you have
05:42 - used
05:42 - in the roblox studio for your platforms
05:46 - so mine was kind of similar to a lime
05:48 - green
05:49 - color so i just choose lime green
05:53 - all right next i'm going to drag an else
05:55 - block outside
05:56 - the if statement but it should be
06:00 - above the weight block so i'm going to
06:04 - drag the weight block down here
06:14 - all right and then i'm going to place my
06:18 - get get an else block
06:23 - and then place it above my weight block
06:27 - like that so inside the else block i'm
06:30 - going to
06:31 - drag in an object equals update block
06:39 - all right so in this block i'm going to
06:41 - give a random type so that
06:44 - the platforms change colors in a random
06:48 - number
06:49 - so you sometimes you may have three
06:52 - green platforms that are turning into
06:55 - red platforms sometimes you may have
06:57 - only
06:57 - one red platform sometimes you may have
07:00 - five red platforms
07:02 - at once that has that is going to be
07:04 - explosive
07:06 - so i'm going to give my range of the
07:08 - number of platforms that is going to
07:10 - turn
07:10 - into red color to be between 1
07:14 - to 5. so first what i'm going to do is
07:17 - i'm going to make a variable to keep on
07:20 - calculating the number of
07:23 - platforms that is going to be changing
07:25 - so i'm going to click on
07:26 - option and i'm going to write
07:30 - random
07:34 - number
07:43 - all right
07:46 - and then on the update slot i'm going to
07:50 - drag
07:50 - in math dot random
07:59 - so the minimum number of platforms that
08:01 - it should be changing
08:03 - is one and the maximum number of
08:06 - platforms that page that should be
08:08 - changing into red color
08:10 - should be 5
08:13 - so next i need to make sure that if the
08:16 - random number
08:17 - or if the number that i have chosen
08:20 - is 5 then i'm going to change my
08:24 - platforms to be red color so
08:27 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
08:28 - drag in
08:31 - if then block
08:36 - and i'm going to change the test to be
08:40 - left equals right so on the left side
08:44 - it's going to be random number
08:48 - and on the right side it should be
08:50 - number
08:52 - five next what i'm going to do is i need
08:56 - to change
08:57 - the platform's color direct
09:00 - so again i'm going to drag in an object
09:03 - equals update block
09:08 - and i'm going to choose
09:12 - color
09:17 - and it's going to be red color
09:26 - all right so now where we have finished
09:29 - the code for the platform
09:30 - so let's take a look at
09:34 - how to make the code file for the play
09:38 - all right so to create a new code file
09:42 - i'm going to click on plus sign and
09:45 - i'm going to give the file name as
09:48 - player and choose the option to be
09:52 - player
09:53 - and it's going to be added as a local
09:55 - behavior
09:58 - all right so this code file is going to
10:01 - time
10:02 - how long the player is alive during the
10:04 - game
10:05 - so i'm going to click on add method and
10:10 - choose on join option
10:13 - next i'm going to drag and if
10:17 - object equals update block place it down
10:20 - here
10:22 - so on the object side i'm going to
10:24 - create a field
10:26 - named as type so
10:29 - i'm going to type fill choose
10:32 - change it to be a field and
10:36 - click on number
10:43 - and then on the update i'm going to
10:45 - click on
10:47 - zero so next i'm going to
10:50 - drag in a while loop
10:57 - and then change the test condition to be
11:00 - true
11:02 - so while it is true i'm going to wait
11:05 - for one second
11:19 - all right so now i'm going to make
11:21 - another method to
11:23 - run my timer so
11:26 - i'm going to scroll down and click on
11:28 - add method again
11:30 - and this time i'm going to make a custom
11:32 - function called
11:34 - time
11:38 - so the timer would run only if the
11:42 - player is alive
11:43 - so we have to make an if statement to
11:45 - check whether the player is alive
11:47 - or not so i'm going to
11:51 - drag an f then block
11:54 - place it down under the timer method
11:59 - and i'm going to click on test
12:02 - and down here you'll have a variable
12:05 - called
12:05 - self.a lot so i'm going to click on that
12:09 - all right so till the player is alive i
12:13 - have to keep on counting so what i have
12:16 - to cut
12:17 - is i need to add one by one so for every
12:21 - second
12:22 - that is under the field
12:26 - i need to rename this as time sorry
12:31 - nice and i'll just drag and equals block
12:35 - object equals update block
12:40 - so i'm going to click on object and
12:43 - click on self.time
12:45 - so the self.time should be keep on
12:48 - updating every second by an increment
12:52 - of one so i'm going to click on update
12:56 - click on left plus right
12:59 - so on the left it would be self.time
13:04 - and on the right i'm going to add my
13:07 - increment
13:08 - which is number one next what i'm going
13:12 - to do is i'm going to use
13:13 - a set stat code block so which is going
13:17 - to display
13:19 - my timer on the game scene
13:23 - so i'm going to write set stack
13:29 - put it underneath self time equal self
13:32 - time done so of time
13:34 - plus one so
13:37 - here it's going to be i'm going to write
13:41 - as
13:42 - time taken which is going to be
13:45 - displayed on this
13:47 - game screen and the valley that it
13:51 - should be updating
13:52 - would be the cell time field so i'm
13:56 - going to click on valid
13:58 - and i'm going to click on self.time all
14:01 - right
14:02 - so i need to run this function timer
14:05 - when i join my game
14:08 - so what i have to do is i need to go up
14:11 - to the on
14:12 - join function and i'm going to call the
14:16 - timer
14:17 - method inside this function so
14:21 - on the code library you can find the
14:23 - timer code block
14:25 - so i'm going to drag this block and
14:27 - place it underneath my
14:30 - wait one second all right so we have
14:33 - finished the code for the player next we
14:36 - have
14:36 - to code the app i'm going to click on
14:40 - plus sign again and i'm going to create
14:44 - a new file called egg
14:47 - and it's object with a local behavior so
14:50 - i'm going to click on that
14:51 - option and click add
14:56 - so in this code we will code the egg to
14:58 - send a message
15:00 - to stop the timer when the player
15:03 - touches the app
15:05 - so i'm going to click on a method
15:08 - called untouched player
15:12 - so i'm going to send a broadcast message
15:15 - so i'm going to find a broadcast message
15:18 - from the code
15:19 - library let's say download that
15:25 - so i'm going to send a long message so
15:28 - i'm going to click on
15:29 - text and i'm going to click on left
15:32 - dot dot right
15:35 - so the on the left slot
15:38 - i'm going to choose
15:42 - string and i'm going to write
15:48 - you have
15:51 - made it
15:55 - the time taken
16:01 - colon and a space so it should display
16:09 - this current value that is inside the
16:11 - field
16:12 - time so i'm going to click on write
16:17 - and i'm going to click on build a block
16:20 - so i'm going to click on player dot
16:23 - type so and i'm going to click on
16:27 - place so now the
16:31 - time slot on the right corner would be
16:34 - how long are you going to display this
16:36 - message
16:38 - so i need to make sure that this message
16:41 - is being broadcasted for five seconds in
16:43 - the game screen
16:45 - when the player touches the a so i'm
16:48 - going to click on time
16:49 - and enter number five
16:53 - all right now we have finished the
16:56 - coding for
16:57 - the platforms the player and the app
17:00 - all right so now once we have called the
17:02 - files the respective
17:04 - files we need to make sure that the
17:06 - scripts are being transferred
17:08 - to their respective parts in the game
17:12 - so what i'm going to do is now i'm going
17:14 - to head
17:15 - back to my roblox studio
17:19 - with the game open
17:24 - all right so i'm going down the
17:25 - workspace and i'm going to click on
17:28 - replicated storage
17:30 - and i'm going to click on code kingdoms
17:33 - and i'm going to click on front shank
17:36 - all right so i have my three scripts
17:38 - here
17:39 - so i'm going to transfer the platform
17:41 - script
17:42 - to the models or the parts
17:46 - in my game up here so what i'm going to
17:49 - do is i'm going to
17:51 - select the platform and click on
17:55 - copy and then go up in my workspace and
18:00 - i'm going to
18:01 - highlight all the platforms that i have
18:04 - in my
18:05 - workspace so i'm going to hold my shift
18:08 - key
18:08 - and select all the platforms
18:13 - like that so that it's being selected
18:17 - and i'm going to right click it again
18:21 - and select the option card paste into
18:23 - selected
18:26 - so right now you can see that all the
18:31 - platforms have the script called
18:33 - platform
18:36 - all right so the next script that i need
18:39 - to transfer
18:40 - is my player so since we don't have a
18:44 - player model
18:45 - up here we have to transfer the script
18:50 - to this player's starter pack so
18:53 - what we're going to do is i'm going to
18:56 - click on
18:59 - copy this again
19:02 - and down in your workspace you have to
19:04 - find
19:05 - the folder called start player
19:08 - starter player and then i'm going to
19:11 - click on
19:12 - start a player scripts and
19:15 - i'm going to paste my player script
19:20 - and the last script that i need to
19:22 - transfer is my
19:23 - egg so i'm going to
19:27 - copy my
19:30 - code file for the egg and go up
19:33 - in my workspace and find where my
19:37 - egg part is and then i'm going to select
19:42 - that
19:42 - and click on paste into
19:46 - so right now i have transferred all my
19:48 - scripts
19:49 - just three scripts platform player
19:54 - and then the egg so
19:57 - that's why it's really important to
20:00 - rename your part
20:01 - so that you can easily identify your
20:04 - parts when you're transferring
20:06 - your scripts all right so we have
20:07 - completed transferring
20:09 - our scripts onto the respective
20:12 - parts on our game so let's head to the
20:15 - roblox studio
20:16 - and up corner and click on click
20:19 - so we can try out our game as you can
20:22 - see the timer is running
20:24 - and then some of these platforms are
20:27 - turning red and you can see that light
20:29 - explosion
20:30 - on the top
20:34 - so we had to be careful in order to not
20:37 - to go
20:38 - towards the platform
20:50 - and i i can see my egg right now
21:08 - all right so you can see that a message
21:10 - is being broadcasted
21:12 - and it's going to show my thought
21:16 - so that's all for today i hope you
21:18 - enjoyed this project don't forget to hit
21:20 - the subscribe button and like our videos
21:22 - also check out these two videos while
21:24 - you're waiting for the next video
21:27 - thank you bye-bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share picking a friendly tutorial on minecraft roblox web programming and many more today we are going to take a look at part 2 of our roblox game called get the easter egg so in part one of this tutorial we learn how to design the game environment of the game which is a jungle and then we created our spawn locations and our easter egg so in this project i'll be using the code kingdom platform to make three code files one code file would be for the platforms to change colors and also to explode randomly when they turn into red the second chord file would be for the player to time how long the play is alive and also the last code would be for the a to indicate that the game is over when the player catches the easter egg so let's get started for the second part of the tutorial i'm going to the code kingdom platform so the first thing i need to do before i code is to make sure that my studio is online so how to do this is that i'll just open up roblox studio where i have my game open up and i'm going to click on plugins and i'm going to click on unlink edit option next i'm going to head back to my editor so then it will pop up a message asking for connection request from your roblox studio so i'm going to click on yes and then i'm going to click on link alright so now it is online now we can start coding in the first part of the tutorial i made a file called platform so this would be the first code file which i'll make to my platforms the green color pads to make them to turn their colors randomly so first thing is i'm going to click on make a method so i'm going to click on add method and click on on create all right so next from the code library i'm going to drag a while loop so i'm going to drag a while loop and then i'm going to change the condition of this while loop to be true so what happens is that so when they are being created it's going to check if color of the platform is red or green so i'm going to drag in a weight block and change the time to be one second so that the colors keep on changing every one second next i'm going to drag in an if then statement and change the condition to be left equals right all right so the condition is to check the colors so i'm going to make my condition to make that if the platform is red color it's going to create an explosion so i'm going to make my left side to be self color so i'm going to build a block so self color then click on place and then i'm going to choose the red color so i'm going to click on the right slot and go down under types and then you'll see an option called color 3. i'm going to click on that and choose red color next to make the platforms to be explosive i'm going to drag in the code block call create and then i'm going to change it to be explosion so that the platforms explode when they turn into red color now once they turn into red color after they explode they have to turn back to the green color so that it keeps on repeating the color change between red and green so next i'm going to under the if statement uh i'm going to drag in and equals object equals update block and place it under the explosion code block and then what i'm going to do next is on the call on the code library i'm going to find the color block and i'm going to drag in and place it inside the object and the update would be turned back into green color so when you're choosing the green color choose a green color that is similar to the green color that you have used in the roblox studio for your platforms so mine was kind of similar to a lime green color so i just choose lime green all right next i'm going to drag an else block outside the if statement but it should be above the weight block so i'm going to drag the weight block down here all right and then i'm going to place my get get an else block and then place it above my weight block like that so inside the else block i'm going to drag in an object equals update block all right so in this block i'm going to give a random type so that the platforms change colors in a random number so you sometimes you may have three green platforms that are turning into red platforms sometimes you may have only one red platform sometimes you may have five red platforms at once that has that is going to be explosive so i'm going to give my range of the number of platforms that is going to turn into red color to be between 1 to 5. so first what i'm going to do is i'm going to make a variable to keep on calculating the number of platforms that is going to be changing so i'm going to click on option and i'm going to write random number all right and then on the update slot i'm going to drag in math dot random so the minimum number of platforms that it should be changing is one and the maximum number of platforms that page that should be changing into red color should be 5 so next i need to make sure that if the random number or if the number that i have chosen is 5 then i'm going to change my platforms to be red color so what i'm going to do is i'm going to drag in if then block and i'm going to change the test to be left equals right so on the left side it's going to be random number and on the right side it should be number five next what i'm going to do is i need to change the platform's color direct so again i'm going to drag in an object equals update block and i'm going to choose color and it's going to be red color all right so now where we have finished the code for the platform so let's take a look at how to make the code file for the play all right so to create a new code file i'm going to click on plus sign and i'm going to give the file name as player and choose the option to be player and it's going to be added as a local behavior all right so this code file is going to time how long the player is alive during the game so i'm going to click on add method and choose on join option next i'm going to drag and if object equals update block place it down here so on the object side i'm going to create a field named as type so i'm going to type fill choose change it to be a field and click on number and then on the update i'm going to click on zero so next i'm going to drag in a while loop and then change the test condition to be true so while it is true i'm going to wait for one second all right so now i'm going to make another method to run my timer so i'm going to scroll down and click on add method again and this time i'm going to make a custom function called time so the timer would run only if the player is alive so we have to make an if statement to check whether the player is alive or not so i'm going to drag an f then block place it down under the timer method and i'm going to click on test and down here you'll have a variable called self.a lot so i'm going to click on that all right so till the player is alive i have to keep on counting so what i have to cut is i need to add one by one so for every second that is under the field i need to rename this as time sorry nice and i'll just drag and equals block object equals update block so i'm going to click on object and click on self.time so the self.time should be keep on updating every second by an increment of one so i'm going to click on update click on left plus right so on the left it would be self.time and on the right i'm going to add my increment which is number one next what i'm going to do is i'm going to use a set stat code block so which is going to display my timer on the game scene so i'm going to write set stack put it underneath self time equal self time done so of time plus one so here it's going to be i'm going to write as time taken which is going to be displayed on this game screen and the valley that it should be updating would be the cell time field so i'm going to click on valid and i'm going to click on self.time all right so i need to run this function timer when i join my game so what i have to do is i need to go up to the on join function and i'm going to call the timer method inside this function so on the code library you can find the timer code block so i'm going to drag this block and place it underneath my wait one second all right so we have finished the code for the player next we have to code the app i'm going to click on plus sign again and i'm going to create a new file called egg and it's object with a local behavior so i'm going to click on that option and click add so in this code we will code the egg to send a message to stop the timer when the player touches the app so i'm going to click on a method called untouched player so i'm going to send a broadcast message so i'm going to find a broadcast message from the code library let's say download that so i'm going to send a long message so i'm going to click on text and i'm going to click on left dot dot right so the on the left slot i'm going to choose string and i'm going to write you have made it the time taken colon and a space so it should display this current value that is inside the field time so i'm going to click on write and i'm going to click on build a block so i'm going to click on player dot type so and i'm going to click on place so now the time slot on the right corner would be how long are you going to display this message so i need to make sure that this message is being broadcasted for five seconds in the game screen when the player touches the a so i'm going to click on time and enter number five all right now we have finished the coding for the platforms the player and the app all right so now once we have called the files the respective files we need to make sure that the scripts are being transferred to their respective parts in the game so what i'm going to do is now i'm going to head back to my roblox studio with the game open all right so i'm going down the workspace and i'm going to click on replicated storage and i'm going to click on code kingdoms and i'm going to click on front shank all right so i have my three scripts here so i'm going to transfer the platform script to the models or the parts in my game up here so what i'm going to do is i'm going to select the platform and click on copy and then go up in my workspace and i'm going to highlight all the platforms that i have in my workspace so i'm going to hold my shift key and select all the platforms like that so that it's being selected and i'm going to right click it again and select the option card paste into selected so right now you can see that all the platforms have the script called platform all right so the next script that i need to transfer is my player so since we don't have a player model up here we have to transfer the script to this player's starter pack so what we're going to do is i'm going to click on copy this again and down in your workspace you have to find the folder called start player starter player and then i'm going to click on start a player scripts and i'm going to paste my player script and the last script that i need to transfer is my egg so i'm going to copy my code file for the egg and go up in my workspace and find where my egg part is and then i'm going to select that and click on paste into so right now i have transferred all my scripts just three scripts platform player and then the egg so that's why it's really important to rename your part so that you can easily identify your parts when you're transferring your scripts all right so we have completed transferring our scripts onto the respective parts on our game so let's head to the roblox studio and up corner and click on click so we can try out our game as you can see the timer is running and then some of these platforms are turning red and you can see that light explosion on the top so we had to be careful in order to not to go towards the platform and i i can see my egg right now all right so you can see that a message is being broadcasted and it's going to show my thought so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed this project don't forget to hit the subscribe button and like our videos also check out these two videos while you're waiting
