00:00 - hi everyone and welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share beginner-friendly
00:03 - tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft
00:06 - web programming and many more
00:08 - and today we're going to create a
00:10 - scratch maze game
00:12 - we're going to create an easy maze game
00:14 - in scratch called
00:15 - save the water and the idea is that we
00:18 - have a water droplet that has to reach
00:20 - the cup in a certain amount of time
00:22 - and we can move it around when we
00:25 - collect the
00:26 - green flag and
00:29 - we can solve the mate but when we hit a
00:31 - wall
00:33 - the water droplet will go back to the
00:35 - starting position
00:36 - so we would have to start again and
00:39 - this is the idea of the game first of
00:42 - all we're going to create a new project
00:44 - in scratch this website is available at
00:47 - scratch.mit.edu
00:49 - and when you enter this you're going to
00:51 - see a
00:52 - main page like that and we're going to
00:55 - click the create button
00:56 - and create a new project this will be
01:00 - loading for a couple of seconds but
01:03 - should be very quick
01:04 - okay so we are already in the
01:07 - application
01:08 - we have a blank project right now we're
01:11 - going to delete the first sprite that is
01:14 - the default sprite that is already here
01:16 - because we're not going to need that for
01:18 - this game
01:19 - so click the delete button and we have a
01:23 - completely
01:23 - blank project first we will need to
01:27 - create the mace
01:28 - and to do this let's go to back groups
01:33 - and when we go to backrooms we have
01:35 - several tools available
01:37 - and we're going to choose the line
01:40 - to draw the mace so
01:46 - we use the line
01:50 - exactly like in paint or
01:54 - other graphics editors
01:57 - we can first make a big rectangle
02:03 - let's leave a little bit of space here
02:15 - the design can be all yours so you can
02:18 - easily change the position of the lines
02:21 - if you really want to
02:27 - remember that the space between the
02:30 - lines
02:32 - has to be big enough for our droplets to
02:35 - fit in so don't make it too narrow
02:41 - so i think that would be my maze if we
02:44 - already have
02:44 - a backdrop like this um we need to add
02:47 - our sprites so our characters our
02:50 - players
02:51 - so to do this we need to go to
02:55 - the lower left corner there will be a
02:58 - button
02:59 - called choose a sprite when you hover
03:02 - over it it will become green like that
03:05 - and
03:05 - it will say just a spray and there are a
03:08 - couple of ways to do it but we're going
03:09 - to go with the first one so the
03:11 - top one and it's called upload sprite
03:15 - because we're going to upload it from
03:17 - images that we already
03:18 - have downloaded um the download links
03:21 - for
03:22 - both sprites are going to be in the
03:23 - description for this video
03:25 - so don't forget to check out the
03:26 - description and
03:28 - download the sprites and also if you
03:31 - like the video so far don't forget to
03:33 - subscribe to our channel
03:35 - and we have a couple of videos
03:38 - already so um don't forget to check them
03:41 - out as well
03:43 - so if we click this upload sprite we
03:45 - will have a menu with our
03:47 - file system basically and so we're going
03:51 - to click
03:52 - the water droplet and there we are going
03:55 - to click the
03:56 - water cup choose a sprite
03:59 - don't click choose the sprite go to the
04:01 - top and choose upload sprite again
04:09 - and this will be the water cup sprite
04:12 - good so so far we have both the water
04:15 - cup
04:15 - and the water droplet but there is one
04:17 - slight problem
04:19 - they are very large so
04:22 - we need to make them smaller and we can
04:25 - do it by clicking on the
04:26 - size text box deleting
04:30 - the size and typing another
04:33 - so for me it's going to be 20.
04:39 - okay and right now you can move them
04:41 - around and
04:42 - as you can probably see they both fit in
04:45 - so so far so good and
04:48 - at this point the design should be
04:52 - already done
04:53 - so the next step will be to actually
04:56 - code the game
04:57 - and to do this we're going to go
05:00 - to click on the water droplet first here
05:04 - we need to have it saved and here we
05:06 - have to have
05:08 - a drawing of the water droplet in the
05:10 - corner of the of the white page
05:12 - that means we're assigning the code to
05:14 - the droplet
05:15 - and we're going to create our code so
05:19 - the first step would be coding the
05:21 - controls because we need to be able to
05:23 - move the water droplet around
05:25 - and to do this we're going to use the
05:28 - second event
05:30 - which originally is called when space
05:32 - key is pressed but we're going to change
05:34 - that
05:35 - for when arrow is pressed so for example
05:38 - when up arrow key is pressed
05:40 - and then we go to motion and for the
05:43 - motion
05:43 - we change y by
05:46 - 10 so we go 10 upwards
05:50 - 10 pixels upwards and then
05:53 - we can copy and paste it and change it
05:56 - to the opposite so when down
05:58 - arrow key is pressed we change y by -10
06:01 - and the same thing will happen with with
06:04 - the x direction so with going left
06:06 - or right when
06:10 - right arrow key is pressed we're going
06:12 - to
06:14 - change x by
06:19 - 10
06:22 - and as you can probably imagine
06:27 - when the left arrow key is pressed we're
06:29 - going to change
06:30 - x by -10 so
06:33 - this will be our control system and if
06:36 - you click your arrows on your keyboard
06:39 - you will probably realize
06:43 - that it is already working
06:46 - okay cool so
06:49 - right now we need to create a system for
06:51 - losing or winning the game
06:53 - so let's say we lose when we hit
06:57 - a wall in the maze and winning will be
07:00 - reaching the cup of water so
07:04 - we go to events and then we select when
07:07 - green or flack is clicked that will be
07:09 - the start of our game and when the game
07:12 - starts we need to go to the starting
07:13 - position so
07:14 - we go to motion once again and
07:18 - there will be a block called go to x and
07:21 - y
07:22 - and both x and y are going to be numbers
07:27 - so this should be the upper left corner
07:32 - let's try minus one nine eight and
07:36 - plus one to two
07:40 - okay sounds about right so we start
07:44 - not touching anything we start in the
07:45 - corner
07:47 - and then we will have to have a loop
07:50 - that goes on forever because the game
07:53 - oh it goes on until you win or lose
07:57 - so we have a look that goes on forever
08:00 - and then we have two conditions one for
08:02 - winning and one for losing
08:05 - okay so we put two if statements
08:08 - and the first one would be if we hit a
08:10 - wall
08:11 - so there is something called a sensing
08:13 - panel
08:14 - um and then we're going to use it for
08:18 - wall detection but how to find the color
08:22 - that the wall is in we click the color
08:25 - here
08:26 - and then there is a an icon at the
08:28 - bottom we click it
08:31 - and then we hover over
08:36 - our wall and it will automatically
08:40 - choose the color that we want black
08:43 - would be easy to choose
08:44 - manually but some colors are really
08:47 - difficult to choose using those
08:49 - three parameters so this is a very
08:51 - useful tool
08:53 - okay and then if we lose we need to
08:57 - go to the starting position and start
08:59 - again
09:01 - so the block will already remember our
09:04 - position so we just drag and drop it
09:06 - go to x and y okay
09:09 - now what will be the condition for
09:12 - ending if we win
09:14 - it will be reaching the the water cup
09:18 - so we go to sensing again but this time
09:20 - we select the first
09:22 - um the first condition so we go
09:26 - here and we drag and drop here
09:30 - um and it right now it says if touching
09:33 - mouse pointer but we're not going to go
09:35 - with the mouse pointer we're going to
09:37 - change it to
09:38 - watercolor so if it's touching the
09:41 - watercolor
09:42 - then we're going to say a message
09:45 - so say something that indicates that we
09:49 - have one
09:50 - so we can say i won
09:55 - and it will hop it will just um
09:59 - hover over um the water cup and the
10:02 - water droplet for
10:03 - two seconds and then we can say we
10:06 - saved water
10:09 - okay that would be um just a simple
10:13 - message
10:13 - for us right now we need to
10:17 - have an additional
10:20 - thing happening when we lose why
10:24 - because sometimes we will lose
10:28 - in a different way so
10:31 - we will have to add something called a
10:34 - timer because we want to make the game
10:36 - more exciting and you remember that
10:37 - there was this timing running
10:39 - uh time running out um when we played
10:42 - the game
10:42 - at the very beginning so we're going to
10:46 - create a timer for our game to make it
10:48 - more exciting
10:49 - and the player should reach the water
10:51 - cup within
10:52 - 30 seconds and if they don't then we
10:56 - have lost the game basically
10:58 - and we're going to make the following
10:59 - code for the stage
11:01 - so we go to the stage page
11:05 - clicking on the lower right corner
11:09 - and we're going to start with an event
11:12 - when
11:13 - green flag is clicked and we will create
11:16 - a variable
11:17 - called a timer
11:20 - okay so we
11:23 - set this timer to 30 at the very
11:26 - beginning
11:28 - and then we wait one second so we go to
11:31 - control
11:32 - wait one seconds and then
11:36 - it goes on forever we will change the
11:40 - timer
11:44 - by -1 and
11:47 - this means it will go like 30 29 28
11:50 - 27 and then we will wait one second
11:54 - again
11:55 - because it will have to be
11:59 - it will have to depend on real seconds
12:02 - then we have again an
12:06 - if block for ending everything
12:11 - when timer equals zero so we go to
12:13 - operators
12:14 - and select the equality one so this will
12:17 - be that one
12:20 - and then we go to variables and
12:24 - select the round timer one
12:28 - and then we change the number to zero
12:31 - and this means we have already run out
12:33 - of time so if we have line out of time
12:36 - then we will broadcast a message
12:44 - and let's say it's going to be a new
12:45 - message and we
12:48 - name it lost okay
12:51 - so we broadcast that we have already
12:53 - lost
12:55 - and every other sprite will catch that
12:58 - message
12:59 - so then we are going to stop everything
13:02 - as well um let's go to control
13:07 - and let's stop the game if we have lost
13:11 - and then again over here we can go back
13:13 - to the water droplet
13:15 - and when we receive the lost message so
13:19 - events when i
13:23 - receive lost the game should
13:26 - end as well and we should also say a
13:28 - message so we can say
13:32 - instead of i1 we can say oh no
13:36 - um we
13:39 - have wasted a
13:43 - drop led
13:48 - okay so this would be the message that
13:50 - we will see when we
13:52 - this so
13:56 - this should be um the project already
13:59 - completed so this is all of the code
14:01 - that we're going to use
14:02 - and and let's click on the green flag to
14:05 - start our game and
14:06 - see if it really works or not
14:10 - okay so you see the time is running down
14:15 - and you can
14:18 - play and make the water droplet
14:22 - reach the cup
14:25 - and if you do so
14:29 - it will go back to um to
14:32 - the initial position and
14:35 - if you hit the wall it will also go back
14:39 - to the initial position but
14:40 - this time you have lost and so it's
14:43 - showing you a message that you have
14:44 - wasted
14:45 - droplet so um that's it for today
14:48 - hope you liked this video and if you did

14:51 - and like our videos
14:53 - and you can also check out our previous
14:55 - videos while you're waiting for the next

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone and welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today we're going to create a scratch maze game we're going to create an easy maze game in scratch called save the water and the idea is that we have a water droplet that has to reach the cup in a certain amount of time and we can move it around when we collect the green flag and we can solve the mate but when we hit a wall the water droplet will go back to the starting position so we would have to start again and this is the idea of the game first of all we're going to create a new project in scratch this website is available at scratch.mit.edu and when you enter this you're going to see a main page like that and we're going to click the create button and create a new project this will be loading for a couple of seconds but should be very quick okay so we are already in the application we have a blank project right now we're going to delete the first sprite that is the default sprite that is already here because we're not going to need that for this game so click the delete button and we have a completely blank project first we will need to create the mace and to do this let's go to back groups and when we go to backrooms we have several tools available and we're going to choose the line to draw the mace so we use the line exactly like in paint or other graphics editors we can first make a big rectangle let's leave a little bit of space here the design can be all yours so you can easily change the position of the lines if you really want to remember that the space between the lines has to be big enough for our droplets to fit in so don't make it too narrow so i think that would be my maze if we already have a backdrop like this um we need to add our sprites so our characters our players so to do this we need to go to the lower left corner there will be a button called choose a sprite when you hover over it it will become green like that and it will say just a spray and there are a couple of ways to do it but we're going to go with the first one so the top one and it's called upload sprite because we're going to upload it from images that we already have downloaded um the download links for both sprites are going to be in the description for this video so don't forget to check out the description and download the sprites and also if you like the video so far don't forget to subscribe to our channel and we have a couple of videos already so um don't forget to check them out as well so if we click this upload sprite we will have a menu with our file system basically and so we're going to click the water droplet and there we are going to click the water cup choose a sprite don't click choose the sprite go to the top and choose upload sprite again and this will be the water cup sprite good so so far we have both the water cup and the water droplet but there is one slight problem they are very large so we need to make them smaller and we can do it by clicking on the size text box deleting the size and typing another so for me it's going to be 20. okay and right now you can move them around and as you can probably see they both fit in so so far so good and at this point the design should be already done so the next step will be to actually code the game and to do this we're going to go to click on the water droplet first here we need to have it saved and here we have to have a drawing of the water droplet in the corner of the of the white page that means we're assigning the code to the droplet and we're going to create our code so the first step would be coding the controls because we need to be able to move the water droplet around and to do this we're going to use the second event which originally is called when space key is pressed but we're going to change that for when arrow is pressed so for example when up arrow key is pressed and then we go to motion and for the motion we change y by 10 so we go 10 upwards 10 pixels upwards and then we can copy and paste it and change it to the opposite so when down arrow key is pressed we change y by 10 and the same thing will happen with with the x direction so with going left or right when right arrow key is pressed we're going to change x by 10 and as you can probably imagine when the left arrow key is pressed we're going to change x by 10 so this will be our control system and if you click your arrows on your keyboard you will probably realize that it is already working okay cool so right now we need to create a system for losing or winning the game so let's say we lose when we hit a wall in the maze and winning will be reaching the cup of water so we go to events and then we select when green or flack is clicked that will be the start of our game and when the game starts we need to go to the starting position so we go to motion once again and there will be a block called go to x and y and both x and y are going to be numbers so this should be the upper left corner let's try minus one nine eight and plus one to two okay sounds about right so we start not touching anything we start in the corner and then we will have to have a loop that goes on forever because the game oh it goes on until you win or lose so we have a look that goes on forever and then we have two conditions one for winning and one for losing okay so we put two if statements and the first one would be if we hit a wall so there is something called a sensing panel um and then we're going to use it for wall detection but how to find the color that the wall is in we click the color here and then there is a an icon at the bottom we click it and then we hover over our wall and it will automatically choose the color that we want black would be easy to choose manually but some colors are really difficult to choose using those three parameters so this is a very useful tool okay and then if we lose we need to go to the starting position and start again so the block will already remember our position so we just drag and drop it go to x and y okay now what will be the condition for ending if we win it will be reaching the the water cup so we go to sensing again but this time we select the first um the first condition so we go here and we drag and drop here um and it right now it says if touching mouse pointer but we're not going to go with the mouse pointer we're going to change it to watercolor so if it's touching the watercolor then we're going to say a message so say something that indicates that we have one so we can say i won and it will hop it will just um hover over um the water cup and the water droplet for two seconds and then we can say we saved water okay that would be um just a simple message for us right now we need to have an additional thing happening when we lose why because sometimes we will lose in a different way so we will have to add something called a timer because we want to make the game more exciting and you remember that there was this timing running uh time running out um when we played the game at the very beginning so we're going to create a timer for our game to make it more exciting and the player should reach the water cup within 30 seconds and if they don't then we have lost the game basically and we're going to make the following code for the stage so we go to the stage page clicking on the lower right corner and we're going to start with an event when green flag is clicked and we will create a variable called a timer okay so we set this timer to 30 at the very beginning and then we wait one second so we go to control wait one seconds and then it goes on forever we will change the timer by 1 and this means it will go like 30 29 28 27 and then we will wait one second again because it will have to be it will have to depend on real seconds then we have again an if block for ending everything when timer equals zero so we go to operators and select the equality one so this will be that one and then we go to variables and select the round timer one and then we change the number to zero and this means we have already run out of time so if we have line out of time then we will broadcast a message and let's say it's going to be a new message and we name it lost okay so we broadcast that we have already lost and every other sprite will catch that message so then we are going to stop everything as well um let's go to control and let's stop the game if we have lost and then again over here we can go back to the water droplet and when we receive the lost message so events when i receive lost the game should end as well and we should also say a message so we can say instead of i1 we can say oh no um we have wasted a drop led okay so this would be the message that we will see when we this so this should be um the project already completed so this is all of the code that we're going to use and and let's click on the green flag to start our game and see if it really works or not okay so you see the time is running down and you can play and make the water droplet reach the cup and if you do so it will go back to um to the initial position and if you hit the wall it will also go back to the initial position but this time you have lost and so it's showing you a message that you have wasted droplet so um that's it for today hope you liked this video and if you did don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like our videos and you can also check out our previous videos while you're waiting for the next one thank you very much for coming along and goodbye
