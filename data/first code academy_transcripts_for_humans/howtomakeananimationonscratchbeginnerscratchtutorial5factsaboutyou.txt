00:04 - all right so today we are going to
00:09 - create this first project of our scratch
00:12 - course called five random facts about me
00:16 - a quick review of what this project is
00:20 - about we're going to share five random
00:24 - facts about ourselves just don't include
00:27 - your name or where you live you can even
00:30 - add music although we will add that in
00:33 - an advanced version and every time we
00:36 - press the spacebar we will be changing
00:41 - the screen to show fact one fact 2 fact
00:45 - 3 etc and lastly you will end it by
00:50 - saying thank you
00:52 - with that let's get started on our
00:55 - scratch interface now once you go inside
01:01 - your scratch.mit.edu homepage what you
01:07 - need to do is to click create it will
01:15 - take a little while to load and once
01:17 - you're inside it the first thing I would
01:21 - recommend us to do is to rename our
01:23 - project so immediately the name has been
01:32 - saved and what we will do now is to go
01:36 - ahead and click on this cat that is
01:39 - automatically placed on our stage and we
01:43 - will click this trash button and hands
01:46 - remove it first the next thing that we
01:51 - will do is to click on the backdrop area
01:55 - let me also turn on my spotlights
02:00 - hopefully you'll see this better so what
02:05 - we will do is firstly creates the first
02:08 - backdrop as - intro screen I actually
02:12 - called the title screen ok
02:15 - okay now we're feel free to choose
02:21 - whatever color that you want let's say
02:24 - I'll choose this lime-green and
02:29 - basically I want to make a background
02:34 - and say this is my first backdrop and if
02:42 - we go back to this project it says five
02:47 - random facts about me so what we can do
02:51 - is to let's say make this choose the
02:58 - black color yeah and we'll draw
03:05 - something like and if we don't like the
03:24 - handwriting that we're doing we can
03:27 - always click the undo button here and
03:30 - because my handwriting is not very good
03:33 - I would choose to use the text function
03:41 - and one you can also still do is to
03:45 - change the color of your text yeah so
03:52 - make it fun it doesn't have to be too
03:54 - serious and you can make it a different
03:58 - font
04:01 - you know pixelated actually I like to
04:04 - pixelate it and you can also change the
04:06 - size about of your fonts great so what
04:13 - we will do next is type about me okay
04:23 - so here you go we have our first back
04:26 - draw it's very green so what we will do
04:31 - next is to start a second backdrop which
04:34 - is by clicking the choose a backdrop and
04:38 - choosing the paint function now you're
04:44 - really free to do whatever you want with
04:47 - the backdrop this time I'll draw a
04:50 - circle again super bright color and this
04:56 - time I'll use a handwriting font and use
05:05 - a purple color so facts number one
05:16 - alright so have you guys spend some time
05:19 - thinking about what facts you want to
05:23 - include well I did so my first the first
05:29 - thing I will add is okay another thing I
05:33 - want to do here is to also update my
05:38 - costume which is the name of the
05:41 - backdrop here I change the backdrop name
05:44 - to fat one it is always a good practice
05:48 - to rename our backdrops and sprites it
05:51 - is easier for us to search for our
05:54 - backdrops when we have more and more
05:56 - backdrops so now here I updated it to
06:00 - fact 1 what I'll do is to again press
06:07 - the text function and say I like apples
06:13 - and I'll change that to pixel again I
06:18 - really like this font and just to make
06:22 - it more fun make it a bright yellow
06:30 - awesome so as you can see here there's
06:35 - no sprites we have two backdrops and
06:38 - we're finished with facts number one and
06:45 - keep going here where it's good practice
06:49 - to just play around with different
06:51 - things and see what they do this time
06:57 - I'm gonna make it I'll make it a little
07:13 - bit more fun where I'll just occupy half
07:15 - the screen this time and it depends on
07:19 - what you feel like in terms of the style
07:21 - of the project it's really up to you but
07:24 - I am choosing it such that the font is
07:29 - the same for the fact and same and using
07:40 - the same font for the other ones as well
07:43 - and using the same fonts for my facts
07:47 - right so maybe I'll use black this time
07:51 - alright
08:02 - so the first fact is I like apples and I
08:06 - don't like oranges and oops let's keep
08:13 - going and we will have a third option
08:20 - you can also have no backdrop and simply
08:25 - say which is what Alexander actually did
08:27 - here where we just put in fact number
08:30 - three we can blow it up I'll keep the
08:36 - handwriting and maybe I'll say something
08:41 - okay
08:42 - I like skating right so keep that font
08:50 - and maybe just make a color that's more
08:53 - fun we can use a maybe a pink color here
09:03 - again this is a good practice to get
09:05 - really familiar with our scratch
09:08 - interface right so we're able to make
09:13 - the fonts really big and change colors
09:17 - here and say I love YouTube cool all
09:38 - right
09:38 - so seems like we're doing pretty well
09:42 - here and what we will do is I'll show
09:45 - you one trick where we can trick our
09:50 - users that will have the fifth facts
09:55 - about us the same as the first one so
09:59 - what I did just now is actually to click
10:01 - on duplicate by right-clicking on the
10:05 - backdrop what it does is is to create a
10:10 - exactly same backdrop so what it does is
10:17 - that it created a the exactly same
10:20 - backdrop as this first backdrop that we
10:23 - created facts one and we dragged it all
10:27 - the way down to the sixth backdrop now
10:33 - one thing that I forgot to do here is to
10:37 - change the costume name we'll change it
10:41 - back to fact three oh so it actually
10:46 - doesn't allow me to change that so let
10:48 - me just change this to fact number five
10:51 - and we'll also change it to fact three
10:56 - and this one fact four great so we'll go
11:04 - back and say change this to fact number
11:07 - five which is the same as fact number
11:10 - one and lastly we can just add a thank
11:14 - you yeah so we can have a thank you note
11:17 - to our user for dropping by to our fun
11:22 - little projects and change that costume
11:26 - - thank you what we can do here is to
11:32 - just say thank you let's change the
11:36 - color for now all right so thank you for
11:47 - stopping all right so what we can do
11:53 - here again make it really easy to read
11:57 - and that's it so take your time to
12:01 - create this fun series of backdrops and
12:06 - when you're done go ahead and click the
12:11 - code area
12:15 - and here you can see firstly on the
12:18 - stage we have seven backdrops which is
12:21 - amazing and and what we will do is to
12:28 - start coding up our blocks once we're
12:33 - back to the scratch interface once we're
12:36 - back to the scratch interface we can
12:39 - click in offense box as you remember we
12:45 - only need to create four blocks today
12:49 - the first one is when we click the green
12:53 - flag so when we click the green flag we
12:57 - one scratch to go to the title page so
13:01 - we will be clicking into the looks box
13:08 - and choose the first block and you if
13:14 - you have to sound on in your computer
13:17 - which I recommend you do that when
13:20 - you're using scratch you might hear this
13:23 - clicking sound which is one your blocks
13:27 - are snap together and the next thing
13:33 - that we want to do is to change the
13:35 - option from thank you to title we can
13:41 - even start testing our code by going
13:45 - over to our scratch interface right hand
13:49 - side where we will be seeing the stage
13:53 - what you can do is to go ahead and click
13:57 - the green flag Wow exactly so you can
14:03 - see that when you click the green flag
14:05 - you immediately
14:07 - is jumped to so you can see that once
14:12 - you click the green flag scratch bring
14:15 - us to the title page
14:20 - one other thing that I want to highlight
14:24 - is that you can see here in the drop
14:28 - down menu that it is so useful for us to
14:32 - rename our backdrops imagine all-out
14:37 - backdrops are just called backdrop one
14:40 - two three and we probably don't know
14:43 - which is which
14:48 - going back to our code what we're
14:51 - missing is to press the spacebar and
14:54 - switch to the next backdrop so go ahead
15:01 - and choose your offense blocks again and
15:04 - choose the second option this block is
15:08 - called when space key is pressed what we
15:13 - will do is to press the looks and then
15:17 - we will be switching to the next
15:19 - backdrop that's it now let's go back to
15:24 - the stage area where we will press our
15:30 - green flag and press the spacebar key
15:36 - try it again and yes there we go we in
15:41 - fact are able to change our backdrop one
15:46 - at a time as we reach the last backdrop
15:54 - scratch actually bring us back to the
15:58 - first backdrop which is pretty cool now
16:03 - we can also test if scratch is in fact
16:06 - bringing us back to the backdrop title
16:10 - wherever we are in the project let's say
16:16 - we're currently in fact number two if we
16:20 - press the green flag it does bring us
16:25 - back to the title page so that's it
16:29 - congratulations with finishing your
16:32 - first project
16:34 - do share a link and let us know how your
16:38 - project goes is to go back to our
16:45 - offense drawer where we can see all
16:49 - these code for different events the
16:54 - challenge specifically asked us to code
16:58 - up such that when we press n we will
17:01 - skip ahead to one backdrop so now let's
17:06 - drag out the same block that we used
17:11 - here what we would change though is here
17:15 - where we will be choosing the N key
17:21 - after that we will go back to the looks
17:26 - and then what we can do is to simply use
17:33 - the next backdrop twice this is a great
17:39 - example that we can actually stack up
17:41 - our blocks however many we like as long
17:46 - as they fit together
17:47 - you can keep stacking them now let's
17:54 - test out whether this works now I'm
17:59 - pressing the green flag and then I'm
18:02 - pressing the space key to test the game
18:05 - is still working it does go to the
18:09 - second screen and now I'm going to test
18:13 - out the N key which I expect that it
18:17 - will go instead of going to facts number
18:20 - two it would go to fact number three
18:26 - there you go and if I press this again
18:29 - we should be going to fax number five
18:34 - perfect and guess what we're going to
18:38 - skip ahead to fact number seven by
18:42 - pressing end again now a great job with
18:47 - finishing challenge number two before we
18:52 - drop off here I want to go back to this
18:55 - particular blog that we've used twice
18:57 - now in this project as you probably
19:02 - noticed just now as you may have noticed
19:06 - just now there are actually so many
19:09 - different options for us to choose from
19:12 - when we scroll down in this drop-down
19:16 - menu you can even use the up arrow the
19:20 - down arrow right arrow left arrow and
19:24 - can you think of a way to use the left
19:28 - arrow so that you can go back to the
19:31 - backdrop well I'm not gonna tell you the
19:37 - answer but go ahead and try to figure it
19:40 - out and I'll see you in the next lesson
19:43 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

all right so today we are going to create this first project of our scratch course called five random facts about me a quick review of what this project is about we're going to share five random facts about ourselves just don't include your name or where you live you can even add music although we will add that in an advanced version and every time we press the spacebar we will be changing the screen to show fact one fact 2 fact 3 etc and lastly you will end it by saying thank you with that let's get started on our scratch interface now once you go inside your scratch.mit.edu homepage what you need to do is to click create it will take a little while to load and once you're inside it the first thing I would recommend us to do is to rename our project so immediately the name has been saved and what we will do now is to go ahead and click on this cat that is automatically placed on our stage and we will click this trash button and hands remove it first the next thing that we will do is to click on the backdrop area let me also turn on my spotlights hopefully you'll see this better so what we will do is firstly creates the first backdrop as intro screen I actually called the title screen ok okay now we're feel free to choose whatever color that you want let's say I'll choose this limegreen and basically I want to make a background and say this is my first backdrop and if we go back to this project it says five random facts about me so what we can do is to let's say make this choose the black color yeah and we'll draw something like and if we don't like the handwriting that we're doing we can always click the undo button here and because my handwriting is not very good I would choose to use the text function and one you can also still do is to change the color of your text yeah so make it fun it doesn't have to be too serious and you can make it a different font you know pixelated actually I like to pixelate it and you can also change the size about of your fonts great so what we will do next is type about me okay so here you go we have our first back draw it's very green so what we will do next is to start a second backdrop which is by clicking the choose a backdrop and choosing the paint function now you're really free to do whatever you want with the backdrop this time I'll draw a circle again super bright color and this time I'll use a handwriting font and use a purple color so facts number one alright so have you guys spend some time thinking about what facts you want to include well I did so my first the first thing I will add is okay another thing I want to do here is to also update my costume which is the name of the backdrop here I change the backdrop name to fat one it is always a good practice to rename our backdrops and sprites it is easier for us to search for our backdrops when we have more and more backdrops so now here I updated it to fact 1 what I'll do is to again press the text function and say I like apples and I'll change that to pixel again I really like this font and just to make it more fun make it a bright yellow awesome so as you can see here there's no sprites we have two backdrops and we're finished with facts number one and keep going here where it's good practice to just play around with different things and see what they do this time I'm gonna make it I'll make it a little bit more fun where I'll just occupy half the screen this time and it depends on what you feel like in terms of the style of the project it's really up to you but I am choosing it such that the font is the same for the fact and same and using the same font for the other ones as well and using the same fonts for my facts right so maybe I'll use black this time alright so the first fact is I like apples and I don't like oranges and oops let's keep going and we will have a third option you can also have no backdrop and simply say which is what Alexander actually did here where we just put in fact number three we can blow it up I'll keep the handwriting and maybe I'll say something okay I like skating right so keep that font and maybe just make a color that's more fun we can use a maybe a pink color here again this is a good practice to get really familiar with our scratch interface right so we're able to make the fonts really big and change colors here and say I love YouTube cool all right so seems like we're doing pretty well here and what we will do is I'll show you one trick where we can trick our users that will have the fifth facts about us the same as the first one so what I did just now is actually to click on duplicate by rightclicking on the backdrop what it does is is to create a exactly same backdrop so what it does is that it created a the exactly same backdrop as this first backdrop that we created facts one and we dragged it all the way down to the sixth backdrop now one thing that I forgot to do here is to change the costume name we'll change it back to fact three oh so it actually doesn't allow me to change that so let me just change this to fact number five and we'll also change it to fact three and this one fact four great so we'll go back and say change this to fact number five which is the same as fact number one and lastly we can just add a thank you yeah so we can have a thank you note to our user for dropping by to our fun little projects and change that costume thank you what we can do here is to just say thank you let's change the color for now all right so thank you for stopping all right so what we can do here again make it really easy to read and that's it so take your time to create this fun series of backdrops and when you're done go ahead and click the code area and here you can see firstly on the stage we have seven backdrops which is amazing and and what we will do is to start coding up our blocks once we're back to the scratch interface once we're back to the scratch interface we can click in offense box as you remember we only need to create four blocks today the first one is when we click the green flag so when we click the green flag we one scratch to go to the title page so we will be clicking into the looks box and choose the first block and you if you have to sound on in your computer which I recommend you do that when you're using scratch you might hear this clicking sound which is one your blocks are snap together and the next thing that we want to do is to change the option from thank you to title we can even start testing our code by going over to our scratch interface right hand side where we will be seeing the stage what you can do is to go ahead and click the green flag Wow exactly so you can see that when you click the green flag you immediately is jumped to so you can see that once you click the green flag scratch bring us to the title page one other thing that I want to highlight is that you can see here in the drop down menu that it is so useful for us to rename our backdrops imagine allout backdrops are just called backdrop one two three and we probably don't know which is which going back to our code what we're missing is to press the spacebar and switch to the next

switching to the next backdrop that's it now let's go back to the stage area where we will press our green flag and press the spacebar key try it again and yes there we go we in fact are able to change our backdrop one at a time as we reach the last backdrop scratch actually bring us back to the first backdrop which is pretty cool now we can also test if scratch is in fact bringing us back to the backdrop title wherever we are in the project let's say we're currently in fact number two if we press the green flag it does bring us back to the title page so that's it congratulations with finishing your first project do share a link and let us know how your project goes is to go back to our offense drawer where we can see all these code for different events the challenge specifically asked us to code up such that when we press n we will skip ahead to one backdrop so now let's drag out the same block that we used here what we would change though is here where we will be choosing the N key after that we will go back to the looks and then what we can do is to simply use the next backdrop twice this is a great example that we can actually stack up our blocks however many we like

does go to the second screen and now I'm going to test out the N key which I expect that it will go instead of going to facts number two it would go to fact number three there you go and if I press this again we should be going to fax number five perfect and guess what we're going to skip ahead to fact number seven by pressing end again now a great job with finishing challenge number two before we drop off here I want to go back to this particular blog that we've used twice now in this project as you probably noticed just now as you may have noticed just now there are actually so many different options for us to choose from when we scroll down in this dropdown menu you can even use the up arrow the down arrow right arrow left arrow and can you think of a way to use the left arrow so that you can go back to the backdrop well I'm not gonna tell you the answer but go ahead and try to figure it out and I'll see you in the next lesson
