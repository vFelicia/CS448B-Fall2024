00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we're going to do a scratch
00:12 - animation called spring cards
00:15 - so here's a preview on how the animation
00:17 - will look
00:19 - so when we press the green flag there's
00:22 - a bear
00:23 - bear walk across the slope says i am so
00:26 - cold
00:27 - when will spring come an envelope
00:29 - appears from the sky
00:31 - and when we click on the envelope
00:35 - we say hello spring okay so let's get
00:37 - started
00:39 - so we're going to start by creating a
00:40 - new project on scratch
00:42 - you can find scratch on scratch.mit.edu
00:46 - so here i'm gonna click on create
00:50 - i'm gonna rename my project to spring
00:52 - cards
00:56 - and i'm also to delete sprite one
01:00 - so the first thing we're going to do is
01:01 - set up our backdrop so if you go to the
01:03 - bottom right
01:04 - and click choose a backdrop
01:10 - we want to find something that are a
01:11 - little bit snowy you can upload your own
01:13 - picture
01:14 - but i'm going to go down here and i'm
01:16 - going to find
01:17 - the one that says slopes and select it
01:23 - now i have to upload four more backdrops
01:27 - to create the animation of the envelope
01:29 - falling from the sky
01:31 - so to do this you can use the link
01:34 - in the description below to download the
01:35 - four backdrops
01:37 - but here you can click on choose the
01:38 - backdrop go up until you get
01:41 - to upload backdrop
01:45 - and i have saved the four files here so
01:48 - i'll select
01:49 - the four
01:52 - click open and now the four backdrops
01:56 - has been uh
01:57 - added to my backdrops so if i go back to
02:00 - code
02:03 - okay now we should add
02:06 - our sprite we need three sprites here
02:10 - so the first initial two uh two sprites
02:12 - is gonna be from
02:14 - uh scratch first one we should pick up
02:17 - the bear walking
02:18 - so just click on bear walking
02:22 - now we should find the one that says
02:24 - butterfly so let's
02:25 - choose a sprite go down
02:29 - to butterfly two
02:32 - and now we need three more sprites two
02:34 - of them is self-made and one is
02:36 - going to be uploaded so let's upload our
02:39 - sprite so click on sprite upload sprite
02:43 - and here i'm going to use the envelope
02:48 - sprite
02:50 - the two remaining sprites that we're
02:51 - going to add are text so we can actually
02:53 - draw them ourselves
02:54 - so to do that we go to add the sprite
02:58 - scroll up until we get to paint and now
03:01 - we can
03:02 - rename and pretty much make our new
03:05 - sprite by however we want
03:07 - so here we want to click on text
03:10 - we can change the text to whatever color
03:13 - and we should change the name to hello
03:18 - now i'm gonna click on the screen and
03:20 - type in hello
03:22 - click anywhere else to uh be done and
03:25 - now i can actually drag this box
03:28 - wider to make the text bigger and i'm
03:31 - gonna centralize
03:32 - the word hello just like that
03:35 - and i'll make another sprite using paint
03:38 - and here i'm gonna use a text swell and
03:40 - i'm gonna write spring
03:42 - change your custom name to spring
03:46 - increase the size of spring and
03:49 - centralize it
03:51 - and that's it for our sprites and our
03:54 - backdrops
03:55 - so the first thing we're going to code
03:57 - is the backdrop so let's go back to code
04:00 - and let's over here at the stage click
04:02 - on backdrop
04:04 - so now the first thing we want to do is
04:06 - when a green flag is
04:07 - clicked we want to turn the backdrop
04:09 - into our slopes
04:10 - so here let's go to events
04:14 - when green flag is clicked and then
04:16 - we're going to go to looks
04:19 - switch backdrop and we're going to
04:21 - switch backdrop
04:23 - to slopes if you like this video so far
04:26 - don't forget to subscribe to our channel
04:28 - and like our videos
04:30 - so let's continue our project with uh
04:33 - coding a bear
04:35 - so initially when the green flag is
04:38 - clicked on we want to teleport our bear
04:40 - to the left side
04:40 - and have it walk to the middle
04:43 - so to do that first let's have an events
04:46 - listener
04:46 - for when that green flag is clicked
04:50 - now we want to show the bear so we're
04:52 - going to go on looks
04:54 - move to show and we're going to use
04:58 - motion
04:59 - to teleport the bear to the ideal
05:01 - location so here
05:03 - i'm going to say go to x and for x i'm
05:05 - going to use negative 240
05:08 - and for the y i'm going to use negative
05:11 - 109
05:15 - afterward i'm going to have it wait one
05:16 - second
05:18 - so if you go to control wait one second
05:23 - and then i'm gonna broadcast a message
05:25 - so here i'm gonna go to events
05:27 - broadcast and instead of broadcasting
05:29 - message one
05:30 - i'm gonna make my own message so if i
05:32 - click on that little
05:34 - upside down triangle a new message i'm
05:37 - going to change the new message name to
05:38 - move
05:40 - okay and now we'll broadcast move
05:43 - and finally i want to move the bear to
05:46 - the middle so here i'm going to use
05:47 - motion glide
05:50 - for one second to x and y and here i'm
05:53 - going to change
05:54 - the time to three seconds to slow the
05:56 - pair down
05:57 - and here for my x-axis i'm going to use
06:00 - 24
06:02 - and the y will remain at negative 109.
06:06 - so now after the bear has shifted we
06:09 - want to use the actual animation that is
06:11 - walking
06:12 - and to do that we'll be flipping through
06:14 - his customs
06:15 - so so you can see as customs we have a
06:17 - lot of different
06:19 - uh different customs that are animation
06:22 - for the bears
06:22 - movement so to do that we can say
06:26 - event when i received
06:30 - and here is already at move and if it
06:32 - isn't so you can click on the
06:34 - upside down arrow and select move
06:37 - here we're gonna say repeat
06:40 - 10 times in each
06:43 - iteration we want to use next custom
06:48 - and between each animation we want to
06:51 - wait
06:52 - 0.25 seconds
06:56 - after he has finished moving we want to
06:59 - have to bear say i am so cold when will
07:02 - spring come
07:02 - so to do this we go to lux
07:06 - say hello for two seconds change the
07:08 - text
07:09 - to i am so cold exclamation mark
07:13 - and add in another text
07:17 - and here we're going to say when will
07:19 - spring
07:20 - come question mark
07:23 - and now after we have say these two
07:25 - things we can broadcast
07:27 - um and next we'll tell the envelope to
07:30 - drop
07:30 - so here we're going to come to events
07:33 - broadcast again instead of broadcasting
07:36 - move you're going to make a new message
07:38 - so click on the
07:39 - upside down triangle new message
07:43 - type in next we're not done with the
07:46 - bear yet
07:46 - but we can use what we have so far to
07:49 - build our other sprites
07:50 - so let's go to envelope so we know that
07:54 - the bear will
07:55 - broadcast message move and that is our
07:58 - cue to drop
07:59 - the envelope so here we're gonna have
08:02 - when green flag is clicked that is the
08:04 - initial stage we want to teleport
08:06 - our envelope to the top of the map and
08:09 - hide it
08:10 - and when it received a broadcast move it
08:12 - waits for the bear to finish moving and
08:14 - then it drops down to the air
08:16 - so here we're going to say looks
08:20 - hide and we're going to teleport it to
08:23 - the
08:24 - default location which in our case will
08:26 - be
08:27 - x of 131 and y of 180
08:33 - and now we should have an events
08:35 - listener for the broadcast
08:37 - of move so here we can go to event
08:41 - when i receive and again we already have
08:44 - moved but if it isn't
08:46 - we can just simply select move
08:49 - here we're gonna say wait six seconds
08:54 - and after waiting six seconds it's gonna
08:56 - show itself
08:57 - so go back to looks show
09:01 - we're gonna glide it down to do that so
09:03 - we use
09:04 - glide we're gonna glass for one second
09:07 - and we're gonna use the same x as 131
09:11 - and for the y i'm going to use negative
09:13 - 126
09:16 - and then i'm gonna wait two more seconds
09:18 - so control
09:20 - weights two seconds
09:23 - and then i'm gonna have messenger says
09:26 - click me
09:27 - so i'm gonna have say for two seconds
09:30 - inside say i'm gonna say click
09:32 - me and the final part for the envelope
09:35 - is that we want the ability to click on
09:37 - the envelope
09:38 - and it finishes the animation
09:42 - so here we want to say
09:47 - event when this sprite is clicked
09:51 - what we want to say is broadcast opened
09:54 - so that we can have the
09:55 - an animation at the end so here we're
09:58 - going to say broadcast
10:01 - new broadcast a new message and
10:04 - the message name will be open
10:08 - and when we press the envelope and the
10:10 - broadcast open we want to hide the
10:12 - envelope
10:13 - and only show the sprite that will be
10:15 - needed for the actual animation
10:18 - so here we can say when i receive
10:22 - i'm gonna scroll down to word open
10:25 - and the only thing we're gonna do just
10:27 - hide the sprite so we can simply
10:29 - put hide and this will complete
10:32 - our code for the envelopes right so if
10:35 - you go back to bear walking
10:38 - here after broadcasting next what we
10:40 - want to do
10:41 - is have the bear also say an envelope so
10:44 - here we're gonna have
10:46 - control we're gonna wait
10:49 - for 0.5 seconds and then we're going to
10:52 - have it say something so go to looks
10:55 - say and here we're going to have to say
10:58 - an
10:59 - n elope
11:02 - and we're gonna have it say it for a
11:04 - second and similarly to our
11:07 - envelope sprites when the broadcast of
11:09 - open
11:10 - is um broadcasted we want to hide the
11:13 - sprite of the bear since it is not in
11:15 - our final animation
11:17 - so here we have event right now receive
11:22 - change move to open
11:25 - and uh just like the envelope we'll
11:27 - simply be hiding it so just hide
11:30 - and this now has uh will be completed
11:33 - for our bear
11:34 - uh coding so now let's program our
11:36 - sprites for the final animation scene
11:39 - so we started with with the hello sprite
11:41 - so if you go in the hello sprite
11:43 - first we want to set the default
11:45 - location and then hide it
11:47 - so here we're going to have events
11:50 - when the green flag is clicked on first
11:53 - thing first we want to hide it so here
11:55 - we're going to use
11:56 - looks hide
12:00 - and then we're going to teleport it to
12:01 - the default location so we're going to
12:03 - say
12:03 - go to x and y and for the x here
12:06 - i'm going to use negative 240. and for
12:10 - the y i'm gonna use
12:11 - 129.
12:15 - so now when the envelope is clicked we
12:18 - know the
12:19 - open broadcast is broadcasted so we're
12:22 - gonna have to listen for that so here
12:24 - we're gonna have
12:25 - when i receive i'm gonna change from
12:28 - move
12:28 - to open and when
12:32 - the open is broadcasted that means we
12:34 - have clicked on the envelope
12:35 - and the final animation will be played
12:38 - so here we're gonna show ourselves
12:41 - so say show and in this default location
12:46 - we're actually a little bit off the
12:47 - screen to the left here
12:48 - so we're gonna glide it back to have an
12:50 - animation of hello
12:52 - just kind of coming off the screen and
12:53 - back into our animation
12:55 - so what we're going to do is go to
12:57 - motion
12:58 - glide and here we're going to glide it
13:02 - to x of negative 138
13:06 - and the y remains the same as 129
13:10 - and that will be our hello sprite for
13:13 - the spring sprites we'll be doing
13:14 - something similar
13:17 - so let's go to spring and here we want
13:20 - to set up the default location
13:22 - and turn it to not show itself in the
13:24 - beginning
13:25 - so here we have events when green flag
13:28 - is clicked
13:29 - we go to lux go down to hide
13:33 - go to motion go to go to x and y
13:37 - to set up our default locations and for
13:40 - the sprite uh spring we want to use x of
13:43 - 108
13:46 - and then y of negative 180
13:50 - and once again when they're broadcasted
13:53 - we want to do the animation
13:54 - so here we're going to have events
13:57 - when i receive change move to open
14:02 - and we're going to show the spring
14:04 - sprites so show
14:06 - and once again on the default location
14:08 - is a little bit off the screen in this
14:10 - case it's a little bit off to the bottom
14:12 - so we want to
14:12 - bring it up so now we're going to use
14:14 - glide so we're going to put in glide
14:17 - for x i'm going to use the same number
14:19 - so 108
14:21 - and for the y i'm going to use 99 so it
14:24 - will come down from the bottom of the
14:25 - screen to
14:26 - up to the middle and that will conclude
14:29 - our spring sprites
14:30 - let's move on to our final sprites which
14:32 - is the butterfly
14:34 - so let's click on butterfly 2. again
14:37 - similar to our hello spray and spring
14:39 - spray we want to set its default
14:41 - location
14:42 - when the green flag is pressed hide
14:44 - itself
14:45 - and it will wait until the open
14:47 - broadcast it will show itself and
14:49 - teleport to the
14:50 - well glide to the middle and when the
14:52 - open broadcast
14:53 - is broadcasted it will glide through the
14:56 - screen and change his animation of
14:59 - flying
15:00 - so here we're going to use events when
15:03 - green flag is clicked
15:04 - we're going to go to looks we're going
15:07 - to use hide
15:09 - and again we're going to set up this
15:10 - default location so let's use go to x
15:13 - and go to y
15:15 - for this we only use negative 200 for x
15:19 - and positive 100 for y
15:22 - and once again it is listening for the
15:24 - open broadcast
15:26 - so we're going to say when i receive
15:29 - click on the upside down triangle click
15:32 - on open
15:33 - here we're going to show
15:38 - and then once again we're gonna glide so
15:41 - here we're gonna use glide i'm gonna
15:43 - actually say three seconds
15:45 - and here we want the glide to a kind of
15:47 - a random location to our screen
15:50 - so to find a random location we can use
15:52 - operators
15:54 - pick random so we can use pick random
15:57 - to actually have it randomized so here
15:59 - we have
16:00 - the range of negative 200 to 200
16:04 - for x and this similar thing for y
16:08 - here we're going to have negative 180
16:12 - to positive 180
16:16 - and now we want to do the animation so
16:19 - here we're going to go
16:20 - on to control forever
16:23 - go to lux we're gonna say
16:27 - next custom and in between
16:30 - each changes we want to wait 0.5 seconds
16:36 - and that will conclude our sprites
16:38 - coding
16:39 - but before we finish we also have to
16:41 - program our
16:43 - backdrop so that it matches and it also
16:45 - hears the uh
16:46 - open broadcast so let's go back to
16:49 - backdrop
16:51 - so now we're gonna add in a new event
16:54 - when i receive
16:56 - and here we're gonna use again open
17:00 - when the backdrop has received open
17:04 - it will play the four different backdrop
17:07 - animations
17:08 - so here we're going to use repeat i'm
17:11 - going to say repeat four times
17:13 - since there are four backdrops and then
17:15 - we're going to drag in the next backdrop
17:18 - into our repeat and we're going to have
17:21 - it wait
17:22 - 0.25 seconds every time we switch it
17:27 - and then finally we'll broadcast the
17:29 - message so here
17:32 - we're gonna go down here and we're gonna
17:35 - make a final thing
17:36 - called message
17:42 - and that will complete our whole project
17:44 - so let's take a look at
17:45 - what our animation has uh has looked
17:47 - like so
17:48 - if you're gonna click on the green flag
17:52 - our bear walks across
17:55 - it says i am so cold where will spring
17:58 - come and the envelope drops
18:01 - and here we click on the envelope and
18:03 - the animation
18:04 - arrives and here we can change the size
18:07 - of
18:07 - the envelope and bear a little bit since
18:09 - it's a little bit big so here
18:11 - i'm gonna go back stop the animation
18:15 - change the size of the bear to 40
18:18 - and actually change anime size of the
18:21 - envelope to 20.
18:22 - let's play this again
18:29 - i am so cold when was spring come
18:32 - envelope drops from the sky
18:34 - it says click me once this is clicked we
18:37 - have opened
18:39 - the envelope with the animation hello
18:41 - spring
18:43 - so that is all for today i hope you guys
18:45 - enjoyed don't forget to subscribe to our
18:47 - channel and like our other videos

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to do a scratch animation called spring cards so here's a preview on how the animation will look so when we press the green flag there's a bear bear walk across the slope says i am so cold when will spring come an envelope appears from the sky and when we click on the envelope we say hello spring okay so let's get started so we're going to start by creating a new project on scratch you can find scratch on scratch.mit.edu so here i'm gonna click on create i'm gonna rename my project to spring cards and i'm also to delete sprite one so the first thing we're going to do is set up our backdrop so if you go to the bottom right and click choose a backdrop we want to find something that are a little bit snowy you can upload your own picture but i'm going to go down here and i'm going to find the one that says slopes and select it now i have to upload four more backdrops to create the animation of the envelope falling from the sky so to do this you can use the link in the description below to download the four backdrops but here you can click on choose the backdrop go up until you get to upload backdrop and i have saved the four files here so i'll select the four click open and now the four backdrops has been uh added to my backdrops so if i go back to code okay now we should add our sprite we need three sprites here so the first initial two uh two sprites is gonna be from uh scratch first one we should pick up the bear walking so just click on bear walking now we should find the one that says butterfly so let's choose a sprite go down to butterfly two and now we need three more sprites two of them is selfmade and one is going to be uploaded so let's upload our sprite so click on sprite upload sprite and here i'm going to use the envelope sprite the two remaining sprites that we're going to add are text so we can actually draw them ourselves so to do that we go to add the sprite scroll up until we get to paint and now we can rename and pretty much make our new sprite by however we want so here we want to click on text we can change the text to whatever color and we should change the name to hello now i'm gonna click on the screen and type in hello click anywhere else to uh be done and now i can actually drag this box wider to make the text bigger and i'm gonna centralize the word hello just like that and i'll make another sprite using paint and here i'm gonna use a text swell and i'm gonna write spring change your custom name to spring increase the size of spring and centralize it and that's it for our sprites and our backdrops so the first thing we're going to code is the backdrop so let's go back to code and let's over here at the stage click on backdrop so now the first thing we want to do is when a green flag is clicked we want to turn the backdrop into our slopes so here let's go to events when green flag is clicked and then we're going to go to looks switch backdrop and we're going to switch backdrop to slopes if you like this video so far

side and have it walk to the middle so to do that first let's have an events listener for when that green flag is clicked now we want to show the bear so we're going to go on looks move to show and we're going to use motion to teleport the bear to the ideal location so here i'm going to say go to x and for x i'm going to use negative 240 and for the y i'm going to use negative 109 afterward i'm going to have it wait one second so if you go to control wait one second and then i'm gonna broadcast a message so here i'm gonna go to events broadcast and instead of broadcasting message one i'm gonna make my own message so if i click on that little upside down triangle a new message i'm going to change the new message name to move okay and now we'll broadcast move and finally i want to move the bear to the middle so here i'm going to use motion glide for one second to x and y and here i'm going to change the time to three seconds to slow the pair down and here for my xaxis i'm going to use 24 and the y will remain at negative 109. so now after the bear has shifted we want to use the actual animation that is walking and to do that we'll be flipping through his customs so so you can see as customs we have a lot of different uh different customs that are animation for the bears movement so to do that we can say event when i received and here is already at move and if it isn't so you can click on the upside down arrow and select move here we're gonna say repeat 10 times in each iteration we want to use next custom and between each animation we want to wait 0.25 seconds after he has finished moving we want to have to bear say i am so cold when will spring come so to do this we go to lux say hello for two seconds change the text to i am so cold exclamation mark and add in another text and here we're going to say when will spring come question mark and now after we have say these two things we can broadcast um and next we'll tell the envelope to drop so here we're going to come to events broadcast again instead of broadcasting move you're going to make a new message so click on the upside down triangle new message type in next we're not done with the bear yet but we can use what we have so far to build our other sprites so let's go to envelope so we know that the bear will broadcast message move and that is our cue to drop the envelope so here we're gonna have when green flag is clicked that is the initial stage we want to teleport our envelope to the top of the map and hide it and when it received a broadcast move it waits for the bear to finish moving and then it drops down to the air so here we're going to say looks hide and we're going to teleport it to the default location which in our case will be x of 131 and y of 180 and now we should have an events listener for the broadcast of move so here we can go to event when i receive and again we already have moved but if it isn't we can just simply select move here we're gonna say wait six seconds and after waiting six seconds it's gonna show itself so go back to looks show we're gonna glide it down to do that so we use glide we're gonna glass for one second and we're gonna use the same x as 131 and for the y i'm going to use negative 126 and then i'm gonna wait two more seconds so control weights two seconds and then i'm gonna have messenger says click me so i'm gonna have say for two seconds inside say i'm gonna say click me and the final part for the envelope is that we want the ability to click on the envelope and it finishes the animation so here we want to say event when this sprite is clicked what we want to say is broadcast opened so that we can have the an animation at the end so here we're going to say broadcast new broadcast a new message and the message name will be open and when we press the envelope and the broadcast open we want to hide the envelope and only show the sprite that will be needed for the actual animation so here we can say when i receive i'm gonna scroll down to word open and the only thing we're gonna do just hide the sprite so we can simply put hide and this will complete our code for the envelopes right so if you go back to bear walking here after broadcasting next what we want to do is have the bear also say an envelope so here we're gonna have control we're gonna wait for 0.5 seconds and then we're going to have it say something so go to looks say and here we're going to have to say an n elope and we're gonna have it say it for a second and similarly to our envelope sprites when the broadcast of open is um broadcasted we want to hide the sprite of the bear since it is not in our final animation so here we have event right now receive change move to open and uh just like the envelope we'll simply be hiding it so just hide and this now has uh will be completed for our bear uh coding so now let's program our sprites for the final animation scene so we started with with the hello sprite so if you go in the hello sprite first we want to set the default location and then hide it so here we're going to have events when the green flag is clicked on first thing first we want to hide it so here we're going to use looks hide and then we're going to teleport it to the default location so we're going to say go to x and y and for the x here i'm going to use negative 240. and for the y i'm gonna use 129. so now when the envelope is clicked we know the open broadcast is broadcasted so we're gonna have to listen for that so here we're gonna have when i receive i'm gonna change from move to open and when the open is broadcasted that means we have clicked on the envelope and the final animation will be played so here we're gonna show ourselves so say show and in this default location we're actually a little bit off the screen to the left here so we're gonna glide it back to have an animation of hello just kind of coming off the screen and back into our animation so what we're going to do is go to motion glide and here we're going to glide it to x of negative 138 and the y remains the same as 129 and that will be our hello sprite for the spring sprites we'll be doing something similar so let's go to spring and here we want to set up the default location and turn it to not show itself in the beginning so here we have events when green flag is clicked we go to lux go down to hide go to motion go to go to x and y to set up our default locations and for the sprite uh spring we want to use x of 108 and then y of negative 180 and once again when they're broadcasted we want to do the animation so here we're going to have events when i receive change move to open and we're going to show the spring sprites so show and once again on the default location is a little bit off the screen in this case it's a little bit off to the bottom so we want to bring it up so now we're going to use glide so we're going to put in glide for x i'm going to use the same number so 108 and for the y i'm going to use 99 so it will come down from the bottom of the screen to up to the middle and that will conclude our spring sprites let's move on to our final sprites which is the butterfly so let's click on butterfly 2. again similar to our hello spray and spring spray we want to set its default location when the green flag is pressed hide itself and it will wait until the open broadcast it will show itself and teleport to the well glide to the middle and when the open broadcast is broadcasted it will glide through the screen and change his animation of flying so here we're going to use events when green flag is clicked we're going to go to looks we're going to use hide and again we're going to set up this default location so let's use go to x and go to y for this we only use negative 200 for x and positive 100 for y and once again it is listening for the open broadcast so we're going to say when i receive click on the upside down triangle click on open here we're going to show and then once again we're gonna glide so here we're gonna use glide i'm gonna actually say three seconds and here we want the glide to a kind of a random location to our screen so to find a random location we can use operators pick random so we can use pick random to actually have it randomized so here we have the range of negative 200 to 200 for x and this similar thing for y here we're going to have negative 180 to positive 180 and now we want to do the animation so here we're going to go on to control forever go to lux we're gonna say next custom and in between each changes we want to wait 0.5 seconds and that will conclude our sprites coding but before we finish we also have to program our backdrop so that it matches and it also hears the uh open broadcast so let's go back to backdrop so now we're gonna add in a new event when i receive and here we're gonna use again open when the backdrop has received open it will play the four different backdrop animations so here we're going to use repeat i'm going to say repeat four times since there are four backdrops and then we're going to drag in the next backdrop into our repeat and we're going to have it wait 0.25 seconds every time we switch it and then finally we'll broadcast the message so here we're gonna go down here and we're gonna make a final thing called message and that will complete our whole project so let's take a look at what our animation has uh has looked like so if you're gonna click on the green flag our bear walks across it says i am so cold where will spring come and the envelope drops and here we click on the envelope and the animation arrives and here we can change the size of the envelope and bear a little bit since it's a little bit big so here i'm gonna go back stop the animation change the size of the bear to 40 and actually change anime size of the envelope to 20. let's play this again i am so cold when was spring come envelope drops from the sky it says click me once this is clicked we have opened the envelope with the animation hello spring so that is all for today i hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like our other videos be sure to
