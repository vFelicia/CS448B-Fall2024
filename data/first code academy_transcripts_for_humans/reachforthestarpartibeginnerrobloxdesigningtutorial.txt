00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - channel
00:03 - so here we share beginner friendly
00:05 - coding tutorials
00:06 - on scratch roblox minecraft web
00:08 - programming and many more
00:10 - and today what we're going to be doing
00:12 - is a fun roblox game called reach for
00:15 - the stars so
00:16 - in this project you have to touch a star
00:18 - circle object right there by passing
00:20 - through some obstacles
00:22 - you have to reach the star by jumping
00:23 - onto these platforms these really thin
00:25 - platforms right here in the game scene
00:28 - and some of these obstacles are also
00:30 - trapped where you will fall when you
00:32 - touch them
00:33 - and when the player touches it the star
00:35 - would blink in random colors
00:37 - so the first part of the tutorial will
00:38 - be game scene design
00:40 - in which i will teach you how to create
00:42 - the game environment using roblox
00:44 - studio and in the second part i will be
00:46 - teaching you how to code the project in
00:48 - lua
00:49 - so let's get started alright so let's go
00:51 - ahead and create our game scene
00:53 - open up our base plate project in roblox
00:55 - studio and the first thing we need to do
00:57 - is to change the lighting in the game
00:59 - scene
01:00 - so we want to go ahead to view and then
01:03 - explore
01:04 - and then we're going to find right here
01:06 - lighting which is
01:07 - used to make the environment look darker
01:10 - or brighter
01:11 - so to change it we want to go ahead to
01:13 - properties as well
01:15 - and we want to go ahead to time of day
01:19 - right now it says 8 o'clock it means 8
01:21 - am in the morning
01:23 - this makes the environment brighter and
01:25 - since it runs on a 24 hour system
01:28 - for us to display time after 12 noon we
01:31 - need to go ahead and add 12 into the
01:33 - time
01:34 - so for example for 10 pm it should be
01:36 - written as 22 so
01:38 - 12 plus 10. so we will go ahead and
01:40 - enter 22
01:42 - in time of day okay so as you can see it
01:45 - gives a nighttime environment
01:47 - next i'm going to go ahead and create
01:49 - the plate where the stars would appear
01:51 - so let me close my explorer and
01:53 - properties
01:54 - so to do that we want to go back to home
01:57 - click
01:58 - part and insert a block
02:01 - all right so we can also change the
02:03 - material to any
02:05 - material or color we like and we can do
02:08 - that right here in edit
02:09 - so material these are your options and
02:12 - color here as well
02:14 - so i'm going to go ahead and make
02:16 - material concrete
02:18 - and color to white and then we also want
02:21 - to change the size of our block so we're
02:23 - going to do
02:24 - that in properties and scroll down to
02:27 - size
02:28 - and we wanted to change it to 32
02:31 - by 1 by 32 and then enter all right so
02:34 - you can see that
02:35 - it is much bigger than before we also
02:38 - want to make sure that we anchor it so
02:40 - we go back to home
02:41 - and click anchor and then we want to
02:43 - place it
02:44 - at a corner of the base plate so i'm
02:47 - just going to
02:48 - go ahead and put it right there okay
02:51 - now one more thing that we need to do is
02:52 - we also need to rename the part so we'll
02:55 - click on it
02:55 - and we're going to go to our
02:58 - explorer so you can see it's called part
03:02 - click on it and then rename it to one
03:06 - okay so we also want to duplicate this
03:08 - plate to create a platform with
03:10 - nine plates in total so we can
03:13 - duplicate that's two
03:30 - three
03:35 - now my my sit from seventh
03:38 - eight and then nine
03:42 - okay now we need to make sure they don't
03:44 - all say one so we can go
03:46 - go ahead and rename it so this can be
03:51 - right click rename to
03:53 - [Music]
03:55 - rename this to three
03:58 - remember four
04:03 - and then five all the way to nine
04:13 - all right so now we have nine plates in
04:15 - total
04:16 - right so we want to make sure that all
04:18 - of them are anchored
04:20 - and renamed in order okay and we
04:23 - need to make sure that they are spread
04:25 - out on the base plate and there is no
04:27 - specific spacing between them so you can
04:29 - decide how far apart
04:30 - uh you want them to be i'm actually
04:33 - going to go ahead and spread them out
04:35 - even more
04:36 - so a little bit space
04:40 - okay it does not have to be perfect
04:48 - all right now next i'm going to make the
04:50 - bridges that are going to connect the
04:52 - plate so that the player can move from
04:54 - one plate to another so we're gonna go
04:56 - back to part
04:57 - and we're going to choose block all
05:00 - right so we can
05:01 - start from one block and extend it to
05:04 - the second block
05:05 - right so we are gonna go ahead to make
05:07 - the width of the fridge
05:10 - so let's make it a little bit longer
05:14 - okay and let's go ahead and
05:17 - to properties and put in the size so i'm
05:20 - going to click on my
05:21 - part right here and in size
05:25 - i will put in let's say
05:30 - three make it a little bit bigger
05:33 - five okay
05:36 - as you can see it got a little bit
05:38 - bigger okay
05:40 - now we want to duplicate this bridge to
05:42 - create
05:43 - two more and connect the other two rows
05:46 - so we can duplicate it
05:49 - move it right here make it a little
05:51 - longer
05:54 - the same thing here
06:10 - similarly i'm going to create three more
06:12 - bridges
06:13 - that are perpendicular to the three
06:15 - bridges we have right now so that the e
06:17 - the player can easily move along to
06:19 - another plate
06:21 - so i'm going to click on one of the
06:22 - existing ones
06:24 - and go back to home and rotate it
06:28 - okay and i'm also going to stretch it
06:33 - okay so this is the very first one i'll
06:36 - duplicate
06:38 - and i have one right here
06:44 - one right here and one right here
06:51 - okay so now that i've added the uh three
06:54 - more bridges
06:55 - i'm going to go ahead and add in a star
06:59 - so we're going to go back to part click
07:02 - on sphere
07:03 - okay and the first thing i'm going to do
07:05 - is actually go to properties
07:08 - and change the size so i'm going to
07:11 - change the
07:12 - size to 12 by 12 by 12. i'm sorry
07:16 - 20 by 20 by 20.
07:20 - okay and since i want the star to be
07:22 - really bright i want to
07:24 - go ahead and make the material neon
07:28 - and i will keep the color red but you
07:30 - can choose any color
07:31 - to your liking and i will also make sure
07:35 - to anchor it and put it on one of the
07:38 - plates that
07:38 - are in the corner okay and then go back
07:42 - to
07:42 - our explorer and also rename this part
07:46 - to star
07:51 - okay so the reason we're anchored
07:54 - anchoring it is because we don't want
07:55 - the
07:56 - players to accidentally push it off one
07:58 - of the plates
07:59 - if they touch it now in the explorer
08:03 - again we're going to go back and right
08:06 - click
08:07 - and group the star part into a model
08:11 - and this will be helpful for when we
08:13 - code to make the star move to random
08:15 - position
08:16 - and then next i'm going to add in a
08:18 - spawn location
08:19 - to go back to home go to our tool box
08:22 - and add in font so i already have it
08:25 - right here
08:27 - okay so we want to put it near
08:31 - plate number one so that's for me it's
08:34 - right here plate number one also make
08:37 - sure to anchor it
08:38 - okay make sure that everything's
08:39 - anchored so i have to go ahead and
08:41 - anchor this
08:44 - anchor
08:48 - and anchor make sure everything you have
08:50 - is anchored it's very important because
08:52 - later on we are going to delete the base
08:54 - plate
09:00 - all right now we're going to add four
09:03 - bombs that will be some obstacles in the
09:06 - game
09:06 - and these bombs will explode when the
09:08 - player touches them so we want to go
09:10 - to part add in a block and first of all
09:13 - we want to change the size so we want to
09:15 - go back to view
09:16 - properties and for the size it will be
09:19 - 12 by 12 by 12.
09:23 - and material should be plastic and the
09:26 - color it can be anything that you like
09:29 - material plastic for me i'll just keep
09:32 - it at bread
09:34 - okay so i'm going to place it on
09:38 - any one of the plates i'm going to
09:39 - actually place it here and also make
09:41 - sure that i
09:42 - anchor it and the next thing is
09:45 - duplicating it so i want to duplicate
09:47 - three more
09:48 - i'll have one here okay and then
09:52 - one let's say here okay
09:55 - and make sure that i rename them to bomb
09:58 - so i'll go back to my explorer right
10:01 - here i have
10:02 - part rename it to bomb
10:10 - okay i need to duplicate one more to
10:12 - make four so let me duplicate this one
10:14 - and place it here
10:16 - and it will already be called bomb
10:19 - now finally i'm going to go ahead and
10:21 - delete the base plate to
10:23 - make the game more exciting and
10:24 - challenging so that if the player falls
10:26 - off the bridge or from the base
10:28 - from the one of the plates the player
10:30 - will die so
10:31 - we just need to go to our explorer find
10:33 - our base plate
10:37 - right here then click delete and there
10:40 - you have it so all right we have
10:43 - completed
10:44 - our game scene you can test the game
10:46 - right here
10:47 - to see if you can move along the bridge
10:49 - freely
10:51 - so that's all for today in the next
10:53 - tutorial we'll learn how to code the
10:55 - game in law where we'll make the star
10:57 - change colors when the player touches it
11:00 - and makes some obstacles like
11:01 - trap plates and also bombs now make sure

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to our channel so here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today what we're going to be doing is a fun roblox game called reach for the stars so in this project you have to touch a star circle object right there by passing through some obstacles you have to reach the star by jumping onto these platforms these really thin platforms right here in the game scene and some of these obstacles are also trapped where you will fall when you touch them and when the player touches it the star would blink in random colors so the first part of the tutorial will be game scene design in which i will teach you how to create the game environment using roblox studio and in the second part i will be teaching you how to code the project in lua so let's get started alright so let's go ahead and create our game scene open up our base plate project in roblox studio and the first thing we need to do is to change the lighting in the game scene so we want to go ahead to view and then explore and then we're going to find right here lighting which is used to make the environment look darker or brighter so to change it we want to go ahead to properties as well and we want to go ahead to time of day right now it says 8 o'clock it means 8 am in the morning this makes the environment brighter and since it runs on a 24 hour system for us to display time after 12 noon we need to go ahead and add 12 into the time so for example for 10 pm it should be written as 22 so 12 plus 10. so we will go ahead and enter 22 in time of day okay so as you can see it gives a nighttime environment next i'm going to go ahead and create the plate where the stars would appear so let me close my explorer and properties so to do that we want to go back to home click part and insert a block all right so we can also change the material to any material or color we like and we can do that right here in edit so material these are your options and color here as well so i'm going to go ahead and make material concrete and color to white and then we also want to change the size of our block so we're going to do that in properties and scroll down to size and we wanted to change it to 32 by 1 by 32 and then enter all right so you can see that it is much bigger than before we also want to make sure that we anchor it so we go back to home and click anchor and then we want to place it at a corner of the base plate so i'm just going to go ahead and put it right there okay now one more thing that we need to do is we also need to rename the part so we'll click on it and we're going to go to our explorer so you can see it's called part click on it and then rename it to one okay so we also want to duplicate this plate to create a platform with nine plates in total so we can duplicate that's two three now my my sit from seventh eight and then nine okay now we need to make sure they don't all say one so we can go go ahead and rename it so this can be right click rename to rename this to three remember four and then five all the way to nine all right so now we have nine plates in total right so we want to make sure that all of them are anchored and renamed in order okay and we need to make sure that they are spread out on the base plate and there is no specific spacing between them so you can decide how far apart uh you want them to be i'm actually going to go ahead and spread them out even more so a little bit space okay it does not have to be perfect all right now next i'm going to make the bridges that are going to connect the plate so that the player can move from one plate to another so we're gonna go back to part and we're going to choose block all right so we can start from one block and extend it to the second block right so we are gonna go ahead to make the width of the fridge so let's make it a little bit longer okay and let's go ahead and to properties and put in the size so i'm going to click on my part right here and in size i will put in let's say three make it a little bit bigger five okay as you can see it got a little bit bigger okay now we want to duplicate this bridge to create two more and connect the other two rows so we can duplicate it move it right here make it a little longer the same thing here similarly i'm going to create three more bridges that are perpendicular to the three bridges we have right now so that the e the player can easily move along to another plate so i'm going to click on one of the existing ones and go back to home and rotate it okay and i'm also going to stretch it okay so this is the very first one i'll duplicate and i have one right here one right here and one right here okay so now that i've added the uh three more bridges i'm going to go ahead and add in a star so we're going to go back to part click on sphere okay and the first thing i'm going to do is actually go to properties and change the size so i'm going to change the size to 12 by 12 by 12. i'm sorry 20 by 20 by 20. okay and since i want the star to be really bright i want to go ahead and make the material neon and i will keep the color red but you can choose any color to your liking and i will also make sure to anchor it and put it on one of the plates that are in the corner okay and then go back to our explorer and also rename this part to

and right click and group the star part into a model and this will be helpful for when we code to make the star move to random position and then next i'm going to add in a spawn location to go back to home go to our tool box and add in font so i already have it right here okay so we want to put it near plate number one so that's for me it's right here plate number one also make sure to anchor it okay make sure that everything's anchored so i have to go ahead and anchor this anchor and anchor make sure everything you have is anchored it's very important because later on we are going to delete the base plate all right now we're going to add four bombs that will be some obstacles in the game and these bombs will explode when the player touches them so we want to go to part add in a block and first of all we want to change the size so we want to go back to view properties and for the size it will be 12 by 12 by 12. and material should be plastic and the color it can be anything that you like material plastic for me i'll just keep it at bread okay so i'm going to place it on any one of the plates i'm going to actually place it here and also make sure that i anchor it and the next thing is duplicating it so i want to duplicate three more i'll have one here okay and then one let's say here okay and make sure that i rename them to bomb so i'll go back to my explorer right here i have part rename it to bomb okay i need to duplicate one more to make four so let me duplicate this one and place it here and it will already be called bomb now finally i'm going to go ahead and delete the base plate to make the game more exciting and challenging so that if the player falls off the bridge or from the base from the one of the plates the player will die so we just need to go to our explorer find our base plate right here then click delete and there you have it so all right we have completed our game scene you can test the game right here to see if you can move along the bridge freely so that's all for today in the next tutorial we'll learn how to code the game in law where we'll make the star change colors when the player touches it and makes some obstacles like trap plates and also bombs now make sure to subscribe to our channel to check out the next section of this project and don't forget to hit the like button thank you bye
