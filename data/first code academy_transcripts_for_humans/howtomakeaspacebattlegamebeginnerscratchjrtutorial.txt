00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share
00:03 - beginner friendly coding tutorials on
00:05 - roblox scratch
00:06 - minecraft web programming and many more
00:09 - today we will be making a fun and
00:11 - exciting project
00:12 - in scratch junior here's a preview to
00:15 - our project
00:16 - in the first scene we have our title for
00:19 - the uh
00:19 - game space invaders and then when we
00:22 - click on the start
00:24 - we enter the actual game where you see
00:26 - aliens appear and disappear at their own
00:28 - rates
00:29 - here we can control the rockets by
00:31 - clicking on the two arrow keys
00:34 - left arrow key to move to the left right
00:36 - to the right
00:37 - and we shoot by pressing the red button
00:41 - yeah let's get started so we're going to
00:44 - start by creating a new project on
00:46 - scratch
00:46 - jr so let's go to home and let's click
00:50 - on new project
00:51 - and the first thing we're going to do in
00:52 - a new project is delete our
00:54 - character click we do that by holding
00:57 - left click
00:58 - over here and we can delete it and now
01:01 - we can change our background
01:03 - to do that we click this picture up here
01:08 - and we can pick the bottom right picture
01:11 - of the moon
01:12 - and the earth press
01:16 - okay next let's make the second slide
01:19 - of our game so here we can click
01:24 - on this button which will make a new
01:25 - screen for us and again we'll be doing
01:28 - tech
01:28 - so hold left click delete
01:32 - and we're going to change the background
01:34 - picture to this space picture
01:36 - the one next to the moon and now let's
01:40 - go back to our first scene
01:41 - with the moon in the earth and we're
01:43 - going to click on this abc button
01:45 - and we're going to write space invaders
01:49 - and this will be the title of our game
01:51 - and over here
01:52 - we can change the color so let's change
01:54 - it to white
01:56 - and press enter and here we have it we
01:59 - have space invaders
02:00 - um circado so now let's add a button
02:05 - for our user to go to the actual game
02:08 - so here you can add a sprite
02:11 - by pressing a plus key
02:15 - and here we scroll down
02:18 - until we find the star which is right
02:21 - here
02:23 - and we can make the start a little bit
02:25 - bigger by going over here to the purple
02:28 - uh person button click
02:31 - on the first one and just double click
02:35 - it
02:35 - a couple of times and that will actually
02:37 - help
02:38 - activate this function which is
02:40 - increasing the size of the star
02:42 - after we're done we can drag this
02:43 - function out and our star will remain
02:46 - the same size
02:48 - now we should add the code for the star
02:49 - so when we click on it it goes to the
02:51 - next screen
02:52 - um so the first thing we want to do
02:56 - is take the wing click on events
02:59 - controller
03:01 - and now we want to go over here to the
03:04 - red blocks
03:05 - and drag in this block over here
03:08 - and now when we click on double star it
03:10 - will bring us to the next screen
03:12 - just like that so for this game we will
03:15 - need
03:15 - eight characters a rocket a bullet
03:19 - three aliens and three user buttons and
03:22 - the three user buttons will have
03:24 - a left arrow key a right arrow key and a
03:27 - shoot button
03:28 - so let's get started so the first thing
03:30 - we'll do is
03:31 - make the rockets so i already have to
03:34 - save up but the rockets is all the way
03:35 - at the bottom
03:37 - so you can go all over the bottom
03:39 - rockets correct
03:42 - and we don't have to focus on resizing
03:43 - this rockets for now
03:45 - and now let's do the controls so
03:48 - to do the controls we actually draw them
03:50 - by hand so to do that
03:52 - we add a new sprite and over here at the
03:55 - top
03:55 - left we have an empty picture and it
03:58 - says character
03:59 - and we'll actually use this paintbrush
04:01 - key to edit this character
04:04 - so first thing first we can just write
04:06 - left arrow and change
04:07 - the title and over here we want to click
04:12 - on the weft and the method strokes
04:15 - so here we want it to be freestyle and
04:18 - let's make
04:20 - the color yellow and let's draw
04:24 - our arrow just like this
04:28 - and when we're done we can press the uh
04:31 - done button at the top right
04:33 - now we have our left arrow
04:36 - and we're going to do the same thing for
04:38 - the right arrow so once again adding
04:40 - sprite character edit character
04:43 - let's change the name to right arrow
04:47 - and the settings are saved for us so
04:49 - let's use draw on it
04:56 - just like that and once again it's fine
04:59 - that it's looking a little bit big
05:01 - um and then finally we want to shoot
05:03 - button and then here i just want a big
05:05 - red circle so add sprites
05:10 - on this character edit character
05:13 - and over here i'm going to change from
05:15 - freestyle to drawing circles
05:17 - and i'm going to change from yellow to
05:18 - red i can just drag over
05:22 - like that and draw a circle when you
05:25 - fill out the circle
05:26 - i can use this paint brush tool click in
05:29 - the middle and you'll fill up the whole
05:31 - character don't forget to uh
05:34 - change this to make this i'm gonna need
05:36 - this button
05:40 - click okay flip between our arrow keys
05:44 - and this would be all for now so now
05:46 - we're gonna create
05:47 - our bullets and three aliens so to make
05:50 - the bullets
05:51 - we can draw on this so create a new
05:53 - sprite
05:55 - new character and then paint brush
05:59 - here we change this title to bullets
06:02 - and instead of using freestyle or circle
06:05 - we're going to use
06:06 - a triangle or a rectangle option
06:10 - make the bullets green and drag it like
06:14 - this
06:15 - and again to fill it we can use this
06:17 - fill tool
06:20 - press okay now for our bullets
06:24 - and before we make our aliens let's just
06:26 - resize everything
06:27 - so using the same method as before we
06:30 - can actually go on each one
06:32 - no one this size down buttons click
06:36 - each one twice drag it up
06:43 - click twice drag it up
06:47 - put in here click it twice
06:53 - and we'll just very quickly resize
06:56 - everything down
06:58 - okay and let's do the rocket as well
07:05 - lens awesome and now let's just
07:08 - reposition everything
07:10 - you want the boats to be inside of
07:11 - rockets
07:13 - to arrow key speed exclusion like this
07:17 - i think my left arrow key isn't too big
07:19 - so i'm just gonna resize it one more
07:20 - time
07:24 - just like so and now we should make our
07:27 - aliens
07:28 - so again we're gonna draw on this so
07:29 - let's click on the create sprite
07:33 - new sprite and uh let's edit our
07:36 - character
07:37 - let's change the name to alien
07:43 - and we can use the furry style and uh
07:46 - they could work and use brown and just
07:48 - draw any shape here you can uh
07:51 - draw any shape use the filler tool fill
07:54 - the whole thing up
07:56 - use the circle option and use red eyes
08:00 - and just form the eyes for the
08:04 - alien again we're going to use fill tool
08:06 - to fill up the middle
08:08 - and this would be our alien
08:12 - and now let's just duplicate this we can
08:15 - do this by clicking plus
08:17 - and the alien we just made will be saved
08:20 - over here
08:20 - as you can see um i've made this once
08:23 - already so all of my
08:25 - previous tries have been saved here so
08:27 - we're going to use the most recent
08:29 - alien that i made and we're going to add
08:32 - two more we're at two of them in total
08:40 - just like so so now let's program
08:44 - the application so we can actually shoot
08:46 - and control with the rockets
08:48 - so here we want the arrow keys
08:52 - to move our rockets while the red button
08:54 - to shoot
08:56 - so let's go on the left arrow button
08:59 - and we're gonna click right click on
09:04 - and we're gonna use this option which
09:05 - will send a signal
09:07 - and if you press on the down arrow key
09:10 - it will drop down to six different
09:11 - colors
09:12 - and basically you will associate the
09:14 - type of signals with the color so here
09:16 - let's assign our left arrow key to this
09:19 - orange signal
09:22 - then we have to close off our block you
09:23 - say the end of
09:26 - block on the right
09:29 - and let's do the same thing for the
09:30 - right here
09:32 - we grab the one click on events
09:37 - signal and this time let's change the
09:40 - right arrow signal
09:41 - to yellow so we have the orange for left
09:44 - and yellow for right
09:48 - now we'll end it with this over here
09:52 - and final step we add the button so
09:55 - again you can select the
09:57 - button by either clicking in game or on
09:59 - the left
10:01 - now grab one click done
10:04 - send to signal and here i'm going to use
10:07 - the same color slip button
10:08 - red make it a little bit easier for
10:10 - myself to remember
10:13 - once again close it up and that will be
10:16 - our whole
10:18 - uh controls for the rockets
10:21 - so now let's program the bullet so for
10:24 - the bullets
10:26 - we want a couple of things first we
10:28 - wanted to move
10:29 - where the rockets is moving so we should
10:31 - give the same commands
10:33 - as uh the rockets in terms of movements
10:37 - secondly when the red button is clicked
10:40 - on we want to set the bullets
10:42 - up and then come back
10:45 - so that it will be the same place the
10:47 - rocket ready to fire it again
10:49 - so to do this we can first hide the
10:51 - rockets
10:52 - at the beginning of the game that way
10:54 - the user can't see it
10:56 - and when the red button is clicked we
10:58 - show the bullets
10:59 - it goes up it hides again and then comes
11:03 - back down
11:04 - from just being invisible so that the
11:06 - user can't see it coming back
11:08 - i can only see it going up so let's do
11:11 - that
11:13 - so first we want the green button or the
11:15 - green flag to be clicked on
11:17 - and make it invisible so to make it
11:19 - invisible go to the purple side
11:22 - this invisible character
11:26 - and now while we add it we want to set
11:28 - the speed
11:29 - of the bullet so we can do that by
11:31 - clicking on the
11:32 - orange blocks select the sky
11:36 - running click on the down drop and click
11:39 - on the fastest option
11:41 - which is would be the one with the most
11:42 - horizontal lines
11:45 - combine it close up close it off
11:49 - next we want to do the movement of the
11:51 - bullets and once again this will be the
11:53 - same as the rockets
11:54 - so here once we receive a signal either
11:59 - from
11:59 - orange or yellow remember orange is left
12:03 - and yellow is right here let's do the
12:05 - left so
12:06 - upon receiving orange signal we want to
12:09 - move
12:10 - and use this blue controls to move and
12:13 - we can use the left dash
12:16 - move it once and that's it
12:20 - close it and now let's do the right
12:23 - arrow
12:24 - upon receiving signal and this
12:27 - should be the yellow signal we want to
12:31 - use
12:32 - the right dash one to the right
12:38 - like that and for the shoot
12:41 - we know we want to receive the red
12:44 - signal
12:46 - and here we wanted the show itself
12:50 - so let's show itself show the bullets
12:54 - fly forward and let's apply for it
12:57 - and let's change this number to seven
13:01 - and then this will reach the top of the
13:03 - screen and after it does you want to
13:05 - make that
13:06 - visible and drop back seven so that it
13:08 - will be at the same
13:09 - location as the rocket
13:13 - changes to seven
13:17 - awesome bend closed
13:22 - and we're done with bullets let's
13:27 - continue with our rockets so here our
13:30 - rocket says two things
13:32 - it moves based on the arrow keys and at
13:34 - the start of the game when the green
13:36 - flag is clicked on
13:37 - we'll start the movement of our alien so
13:40 - it will go invisible
13:41 - and invisible within the timer making us
13:44 - have to hit them when it's visible so
13:47 - here
13:48 - for the movement it will be the same
13:50 - thing as the bullet
13:52 - so upon receiving an orange signal
13:56 - and we know that's a left turn we'll
13:58 - move it
13:59 - one to the left closing
14:03 - and now upon receiving a yellow signal
14:06 - which we know is a right arrow key
14:08 - we'll move it one to the right
14:12 - and close it up and finally
14:15 - when the green flag is clicked on we
14:18 - want
14:19 - to set the speed of our kit of our
14:23 - uh rocket and set it to the fastest
14:26 - and now we also want to send a signal to
14:30 - the aliens so here we'll have
14:33 - send signal and here we can send
14:37 - a green signal a new one that the alien
14:41 - will be checking for
14:43 - again close it that will be
14:47 - for aliens or that will be for all
14:50 - for our rockets and let's move to the
14:53 - aliens
14:55 - so for the aliens we want them to
14:59 - start being invisible and visible
15:03 - within the timer after the green flag is
15:05 - clicked on
15:07 - and we already know that our bullets
15:09 - over here
15:11 - follows our as follows our rockets
15:14 - which are rockets would then send a
15:17 - signal upon
15:18 - having the green flag to our aliens
15:23 - so here we want to check for the green
15:24 - flag
15:26 - so upon receiving the green flag
15:29 - we can start the process of invisibility
15:33 - and turning invisible and visible within
15:36 - the timer
15:38 - so to do a timer we can first add 10
15:42 - seconds and change the set to 5
15:46 - and you're going to say for after 5
15:48 - seconds be invisible
15:51 - and have another timer this time we can
15:54 - keep it as 10
15:56 - and uh here we want to turn it to
15:58 - visible
16:01 - and we want this to repeat so we're
16:03 - going to use the repeat end
16:04 - over here just like that
16:08 - and finally when it hits or gets hit by
16:10 - the bullets
16:12 - we want the alien to turn invisible
16:15 - so here we go back to the events when
16:18 - this sprite is touched
16:20 - we want to set sprite 3 into symbols
16:24 - that would be all
16:27 - and this is the last part of the project
16:30 - um
16:31 - this is a whole game we should copy the
16:33 - same exact code over here to the other
16:36 - two aliens
16:38 - so let's do that really quickly
16:41 - events check green flag
16:45 - and here we can actually change the
16:47 - timer settings a little bit
16:48 - you can have 10 seconds to be invisible
16:53 - and then wait five seconds
16:58 - and you'll turn physical so this
17:00 - basically will turn
17:01 - visible for 10 seconds and then turn it
17:05 - invisible
17:06 - and then after 5 seconds turn back
17:07 - visible
17:09 - and again when it's touched on i want it
17:12 - to be invisible
17:15 - that'll be all yes let's move on to our
17:19 - last alien
17:21 - when we see it's free signal
17:27 - let's wait five seconds
17:30 - turn invisible and again wait five
17:33 - seconds
17:38 - turn invisible again these numbers you
17:40 - guys can
17:41 - change around to your likings finally we
17:44 - have the collision
17:47 - in which we turn it invisible
17:51 - at the end
17:56 - that's all for today hope you enjoyed it
17:58 - don't forget to subscribe
18:00 - and like our videos also check out our
18:02 - other two videos here
18:03 - while you're waiting for the next video
18:06 - thank you bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on roblox scratch minecraft web programming and many more today we will be making a fun and exciting project in scratch junior here's a preview to our project in the first scene we have our title for the uh game space invaders and then when we click on the start we enter the actual game where you see aliens appear and disappear at their own rates here we can control the rockets by clicking on the two arrow keys left arrow key to move to the left right to the right and we shoot by pressing the red button yeah let's get started so we're going to start by creating a new project on scratch jr so let's go to home and let's click on new project and the first thing we're going to do in a new project is delete our character click we do that by holding left click over here and we can delete it and now we can change our background to do that we click this picture up here and we can pick the bottom right picture of the moon and the earth press okay next let's make the second slide of our game so here we can click on this button which will make a new screen for us and again we'll be doing tech so hold left click delete and we're going to change the background picture to this space picture the one next to the moon and now let's go back to our first scene with the moon in the earth and we're going to click on this abc button and we're going to write space invaders and this will be the title of our game and over here we can change the color so let's change it to white and press enter and here we have it we have space invaders um circado so now let's add a button for our user to go to the actual game so here you can add a sprite by pressing a plus key and here we scroll down until we find the star which is right here and we can make the start a little bit bigger by going over here to the purple uh person button click on the first one and just double click it a couple of times and that will actually help activate this function which is increasing the size of the star after we're done we can drag this function out and our star will remain the same size now we should add the code for the star so when we click on it it goes to the next screen um so the first thing we want to do is take the wing click on events controller and now we want to go over here to the red blocks and drag in this block over here and now when we click on double star it will bring us to the next screen just like that so for this game we will need eight characters a rocket a bullet three aliens and three user buttons and the three user buttons will have a left arrow key a right arrow key and a shoot button so let's get started so the first thing we'll do is make the rockets so i already have to save up but the rockets is all the way at the bottom so you can go all over the bottom rockets correct and we don't have to focus on resizing this rockets for now and now let's do the controls so to do the controls we actually draw them by hand so to do that we add a new sprite and over here at the top left we have an empty picture and it says character and we'll actually use this paintbrush key to edit this character so first thing first we can just write left arrow and change the title and over here we want to click on the weft and the method strokes so here we want it to be freestyle and let's make the color yellow and let's draw our arrow just like this and when we're done we can press the uh done button at the top right now we have our left arrow and we're going to do the same thing for the right arrow so once again adding sprite character edit character let's change the name to right arrow and the settings are saved for us so let's use draw on it just like that and once again it's fine that it's looking a little bit big um and then finally we want to shoot button and then here i just want a big red circle so add sprites on this character edit character and over here i'm going to change from freestyle to drawing circles and i'm going to change from yellow to red i can just drag over like that and draw a circle when you fill out the circle i can use this paint brush tool click in the middle and you'll fill up the whole character don't forget to uh change this to make this i'm gonna need this button click okay flip between our arrow keys and this would be all for now so now we're gonna create our bullets and three aliens so to make the bullets we can draw on this so create a new sprite new character and then paint brush here we change this title to bullets and instead of using freestyle or circle we're going to use a triangle or a rectangle option make the bullets green and drag it like this and again to fill it we can use this fill tool press okay now for our bullets and before we make our aliens let's just resize everything so using the same method as before we can actually go on each one no one this size down buttons click each one twice drag it up click twice drag it up put in here click it twice and we'll just very quickly resize everything down okay and let's do the rocket as well lens awesome and now let's just reposition everything you want the boats to be inside of rockets to arrow key speed exclusion like this i think my left arrow key isn't too big so i'm just gonna resize it one more time just like so and now we should make our aliens so again we're gonna draw on this so let's click on the create sprite new sprite and uh let's edit our character let's change the name to alien and we can use the furry style and uh they could work and use brown and just draw any shape here you can uh draw any shape use the filler tool fill the whole thing up use the circle option and use red eyes and just form the eyes for the alien again we're going to use fill tool to fill up the middle and this would be our alien and now let's just duplicate this we can do this by clicking plus and the alien we just made will be saved over here as you can see um i've made this once already so all of my previous tries have been saved here so we're going to use the most recent alien that i made and we're going to add two more we're at two of them in total just like so so now let's program the application so we can actually shoot and control with the rockets so here we want the arrow keys to move our rockets while the red button to shoot so let's go on the left arrow button and we're gonna click right click on and we're gonna use this option which will send a signal and if you press on the down arrow key it will drop down to six different colors and basically you will associate the type of signals with the color so here let's assign our left arrow key to this orange signal then we have to close off our block you say the end of block on the right and let's do the same thing for the right here we grab the one click on events signal and this time let's change the right arrow signal to yellow so we have the orange for left and yellow for right now we'll end it with this over here and final step we add the button so again you can select the button by either clicking in game or on the left now grab one click done send to signal and here i'm going to use the same color slip button red make it a little bit easier for myself to remember once again close it up and that will be our whole uh controls for the rockets so now let's program the bullet so for the bullets we want a couple of things first we wanted to move where the rockets is moving so we should give the same commands as uh the rockets in terms of movements secondly when the red button is clicked on we want to set the bullets up and then come back so that it will be the same place the rocket ready to fire it again so to do this we can first hide the rockets at the beginning of the game that way the user can't see it and when the red button is clicked we show the bullets it goes up it hides again and then comes back down from just being invisible so that the user can't see it coming back i can only see it going up so let's do that so first we want the green button or the green flag to be clicked on and make it invisible so to make it invisible go to the purple side this invisible character and now while we add it we want to set the speed of the bullet so we can do that by clicking on the orange blocks select the sky running click on the down drop and click on the fastest option which is would be the one with the most horizontal lines combine it close up close it off next we want to do the movement of the bullets and once again this will be the same as the rockets so here once we receive a signal either from orange or yellow remember orange is left and yellow is right here let's do the left so upon receiving orange signal we want to move and use this blue controls to move and we can use the left dash move it once and that's it close it and now let's do the right arrow upon receiving signal and this should be the yellow signal we want to use the right dash one to the right like that and for the shoot we know we want to receive the red signal and here we wanted the show itself so let's show itself show the bullets fly forward and let's apply for it and let's change this number to seven and then this will reach the top of the screen and after it does you want to make that visible and drop back seven so that it will be at the same location as the rocket changes to seven awesome bend closed and we're done with bullets let's continue with our rockets so here our rocket says two things it moves based on the arrow keys and at the start of the game when the green flag is clicked on we'll start the movement of our alien so it will go invisible and invisible within the timer making us have to hit them when it's visible so here for the movement it will be the same thing as the bullet so upon receiving an orange signal and we know that's a left turn we'll move it one to the left closing and now upon receiving a yellow signal which we know is a right arrow key we'll move it one to the right and close it up and finally when the green flag is clicked on we want to set the speed of our kit of our uh rocket and set it to the fastest and now we also want to send a signal to the aliens so here we'll have send signal and here we can send a green signal a new one that the alien will be checking for again close it that will be for aliens or that will be for all for our rockets and let's move to the aliens so for the aliens we want them to start being invisible and visible within the timer after the green flag is clicked on and we already know that our bullets over here follows our as follows our rockets which are rockets would then send a signal upon having the green flag to our aliens so here we want to check for the green flag so upon receiving the green flag we can start the process of invisibility and turning invisible and visible within the timer so to do a timer we can first add 10 seconds and change the set to 5 and you're going to say for after 5 seconds be invisible and have another timer this time we can keep it as 10 and uh here we want to turn it to visible and we want this to repeat so we're going to use the repeat end over here just like that and finally when it hits or gets hit by the bullets we want the alien to turn invisible so here we go back to the events when this sprite is touched we want to set sprite 3 into symbols that would be all and this is the last part of the project um this is a whole game we should copy the same exact code over here to the other two aliens so let's do that really quickly events check green flag and here we can actually change the timer settings a little bit you can have 10 seconds to be invisible and then wait five seconds and you'll turn physical so this basically will turn visible for 10 seconds and then turn it invisible and then after 5 seconds turn back visible and again when it's touched on i want it to be invisible that'll be all yes let's move on to our last alien when we see it's free signal let's wait five seconds turn invisible and again wait five seconds turn invisible again these numbers you guys can change around to your likings finally we have the collision in which we turn it invisible at the end that's all for today hope you enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check
