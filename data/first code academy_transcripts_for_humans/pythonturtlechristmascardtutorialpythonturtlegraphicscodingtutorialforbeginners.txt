00:00 - hi everybody my name is fernando and
00:02 - today we're going to do a project on
00:04 - python turtle
00:05 - called christmas card in this project
00:08 - you will be sharing how to use
00:10 - functions and shape drawing in python
00:13 - turtle to create
00:15 - unique christmas card every time you run
00:17 - the project so as we can see right now
00:20 - we're adding the moon and a couple of
00:23 - stars
00:23 - in random positions which will in turn
00:26 - lead to the creation of our own
00:28 - christmas card you can send to your
00:29 - friends
00:32 - let's begin coding our project first of
00:34 - all for any python project we're gonna
00:36 - make
00:37 - we need to import the necessary
00:38 - libraries for it to work
00:40 - the first library we're gonna import is
00:42 - the turtle library because it's very
00:44 - essential to do a
00:45 - turtle project so from turtle import
00:50 - everything this symbol indicates that
00:51 - we're going to port everything that
00:52 - belongs to the turtle library
00:55 - next of all now we're going to import
00:58 - the random
00:59 - library random indicates anything that
01:02 - we cannot predict
01:04 - just to throw the result of throwing
01:05 - dices or the result of flipping a coin
01:08 - we want this so that the stars that we
01:10 - are going to show in our project
01:12 - are not the same stars or the same
01:14 - position every time we do a new card so
01:16 - that it's a unique card every time we do
01:18 - it
01:18 - we don't need to import the entire
01:20 - library we just need to import
01:22 - the rand instruction next we need to
01:24 - define some functions
01:26 - to draw the shapes that we're going to
01:27 - show in our project
01:29 - the first shape we're going to show is a
01:31 - circle
01:32 - the circle is going to be used to draw
01:34 - the moon to do that
01:37 - let's name it draw circle and we need to
01:40 - specify some parameters
01:42 - parameters are the things that functions
01:44 - need in order to
01:45 - work so the parameters for this function
01:47 - are gonna be the turtle we're gonna use
01:50 - the x and y position the color of the
01:52 - moon
01:53 - and how big the moon is gonna be so to
01:55 - name them we're just gonna use some easy
01:57 - names to recognize them
01:58 - turtle for the turtle color for the
02:01 - color
02:02 - x and y for the y position and x
02:04 - position and the radius to indicate the
02:06 - size of the moon
02:09 - the instructions we're going to use to
02:12 - draw the moon
02:13 - are pretty simple first we need to raise
02:17 - the turtle so it doesn't leave a line
02:18 - wherever it moves
02:21 - we ship that using turtle.pennad now we
02:24 - need to change the color of the turtle
02:26 - we use that turtle.color and inside
02:29 - the the color function we've got to
02:32 - specify which color we want to use
02:34 - next we're gonna fill everything that we
02:38 - draw the circle in
02:39 - with the same color we do that by
02:42 - telling the turtle to fill the color
02:45 - using the color we tell it to do
02:47 - in this case it's the same color as the
02:48 - function over here
02:50 - next we're going to move the turtle to
02:53 - our desired position
02:54 - so we just use go to x and y for the x
02:57 - and y positions we need to be
02:59 - next we're going to set the turtle down
03:02 - so you can start drawing
03:03 - turtle that pin down
03:06 - next we're gonna begin filling the the
03:09 - circle that we're gonna draw
03:10 - so the moon locks look solid and not
03:13 - just like a circle
03:14 - with some blue on the back or the color
03:16 - of the sky we want to use
03:19 - so we do that by doing turtle.beginfill
03:24 - next we're going to draw a circle that
03:26 - is going to be the size that we tell
03:28 - the turtle to do we already specified
03:30 - this in the
03:31 - draw circle function so we just do
03:33 - turtle dot
03:35 - circle to draw a circle
03:38 - and the size is gonna be just the radius
03:40 - size
03:41 - the last instruction for this function
03:42 - is just gonna be to tell the turtle
03:44 - to stop filling it everything that is
03:46 - drawing so turtle dot
03:48 - and fill
03:51 - the next function we need to define is a
03:53 - function to draw the stars
03:58 - this function is going to use the same
03:59 - parameters as the draw circle one
04:02 - we're just going to call instead of
04:05 - radius we're going to use the word
04:06 - size
04:10 - now most of the instructions are going
04:12 - to be pretty similar we can copy
04:15 - all of these instructions and paste them
04:18 - here
04:19 - we need we need to do basically the same
04:21 - things raise the turtle
04:23 - change the color change the fill color
04:25 - move to the
04:26 - starting position set the pin down and
04:29 - start filling it in
04:32 - the first instruction we're gonna do
04:34 - that is specific to the star
04:36 - is gonna rotate it to the right about
04:39 - 144 degrees
04:41 - this is just so the star has this
04:43 - specific pattern
04:45 - you know the five points of the star can
04:47 - be set up correctly
04:50 - now because we have a five-pointed star
04:53 - we need to repeat the same thing
04:54 - five times which is moving the turtle
04:56 - and making sure it goes to each one of
04:58 - the corners
04:59 - so to repeat an action we use a loop
05:02 - a loop is an instruction that repeats
05:04 - the actions that are inside of it
05:06 - the desired amount of times we specify
05:08 - it two
05:10 - in this case the easiest function to use
05:12 - or the easiest
05:13 - loop to use is gonna be the for loop
05:17 - for i in range five indicates that we're
05:20 - gonna
05:21 - do the instruction five times
05:25 - we're going to move first the turtle
05:27 - forward so you can do one leg of the
05:29 - star
05:31 - how big we gonna want to move it well we
05:34 - already specified it here in size
05:36 - so we just set it to move forward size
05:39 - pixels then we're going to make it turn
05:41 - to the right
05:45 - the same degrees 144.
05:49 - finally we're going to move it again
05:53 - for the size pixels that we wanted to
05:56 - move
05:56 - it doesn't look like it right now but
05:58 - when all of them
06:00 - move for five times they're gonna end up
06:02 - filling up the triangles that are gonna
06:04 - be formed around
06:06 - this shape
06:10 - we finish the function the same way as
06:12 - we finish the
06:13 - circle function and fill
06:16 - and now we add another function that
06:19 - says set heading
06:21 - 0 this function basically just specifies
06:25 - that we
06:26 - want to stop pointing in a random
06:28 - direction we just want it to point in
06:30 - the specific zero direction which is the
06:32 - default one for
06:33 - python turtle next on the list is we
06:36 - want to
06:37 - start coding the main part of the
06:40 - program
06:41 - so we can draw our christmas card
06:45 - the first thing we need to do is to
06:46 - create our first pen
06:48 - or our first turtle we're just going to
06:50 - call it my pen
06:52 - equals turtle
06:56 - this functions creates a turtle for us
07:00 - just just gonna give it a shape in this
07:03 - case
07:04 - you can just specify it for it to be the
07:06 - turtle shape
07:07 - so it doesn't look just like the
07:08 - triangle it comes by default
07:11 - i'm gonna set the speed
07:15 - this one is pretty much up to you how
07:17 - fast do you want it
07:18 - to look i'm gonna go with 10 so it
07:21 - doesn't look too fast or too slow
07:24 - now we need to create a window for
07:27 - the christmas card to be in window
07:31 - equals turtle dot screen
07:35 - remember the names of the variables are
07:37 - picked by you
07:38 - but it's very a good idea that you make
07:41 - them related to the thing you're doing
07:43 - so you don't confuse people that look at
07:44 - your code without knowing what you're
07:46 - doing
07:49 - now i'm gonna specify the background
07:51 - color for my window
07:55 - you can pick any of the default colors
07:58 - or you can pick
07:59 - a color based on this hexadecimal value
08:04 - if you want to pick a color but you
08:06 - don't know which one is the hexadecimal
08:07 - value of course you don't know with my
08:09 - memory
08:09 - you can always google it up in a color
08:13 - selector
08:14 - probably and you can find many pages
08:18 - three pages that can give you if you
08:20 - pick a color it will give you the value
08:21 - in hexadecimal value
08:23 - okay remember this is written like this
08:27 - exorcism
08:29 - okay now
08:32 - let's start drawing the moon to draw the
08:35 - moon
08:37 - we're gonna first make a white circle
08:39 - well how we do it we already have the
08:41 - function right
08:42 - my pen is the turtle white is the color
08:45 - name
08:47 - and then the positions well we're always
08:50 - gonna make the moon in the same position
08:52 - so you can always adjust this
08:55 - it's up to you okay
08:59 - this is the x position the y position
09:02 - and how big we want the move to be
09:04 - all of these values can be adjusted by
09:06 - you according to your preference
09:10 - now to make the moon being a quarter
09:13 - moon face
09:14 - we're gonna draw another circle
09:18 - using my pen with the same color as we
09:21 - have the sky
09:22 - so it looks like it is part of the sky
09:25 - you know
09:26 - like it disappears so we're gonna make
09:28 - it disappear
09:29 - we're gonna move it a little bit to the
09:30 - left so let's say 100
09:33 - 80 and 50. the more you move it to the
09:37 - left
09:38 - or to the right the more of the moon
09:42 - you're gonna show in the end
09:43 - in this case i'm gonna move it 20 pixels
09:45 - to the left
09:46 - so it leaves like a thin moon behind
09:50 - if you want to make it thinner or
09:51 - thicker you can modify this value
09:54 - of the x value so it changes the shape
09:56 - of the moon you can always play around
09:58 - with it
10:00 - now the number of stars
10:04 - are gonna be random so this is the first
10:07 - instance we're gonna use a random value
10:09 - okay
10:12 - we're gonna pick a random number between
10:14 - section six and twelve
10:16 - of course you can pick the random value
10:18 - yourself
10:21 - now let's begin to make
10:24 - the star it's always going to be the
10:26 - same function we're just going to repeat
10:28 - it a different number of times
10:29 - okay to do this
10:33 - we're gonna use a for loop again just as
10:35 - before
10:36 - for a star in range
10:40 - okay number of stars
10:44 - so for example if we got
10:48 - seven stars as a result of this random
10:50 - operation
10:51 - we're gonna do this loop seven times if
10:54 - we get eight we're gonna do it eight
10:55 - times
10:58 - now for the x and y positions well we're
11:01 - just going to pick a number
11:03 - remember in python turtle the zero comma
11:05 - zero position
11:06 - in the x and y axis is just in the
11:08 - middle so we need in
11:09 - negative value values as well for it to
11:11 - be anywhere in the screen
11:15 - we're going to pick a random integer
11:17 - between a negative number and a positive
11:19 - number we want
11:21 - in this case i'm going to pick minus 180
11:23 - and 180 so it's confined to a little box
11:26 - the same with what the y value
11:30 - you can always speak different values
11:32 - for example i'm gonna pick a different
11:33 - one here
11:34 - i'm gonna go with a hundred
11:40 - the next thing we're gonna do is the
11:41 - size of the star the size we're also
11:43 - going to do it randomly
11:45 - so you should do it very quickly right
11:48 - now
11:48 - i'm going to pick a size between let's
11:50 - say 10 and 20.
11:52 - anything below 10 is going to look very
11:54 - small anything above 20
11:56 - it's probably going to cover another
11:57 - start and
12:00 - of course we cannot control it because
12:01 - it's random but we don't want it to be
12:04 - too confusing to look at
12:07 - last of all in the for loop
12:10 - we need to actually draw the star so
12:12 - remember draw star is the function we're
12:14 - going to use
12:16 - my pen is the turtle we're going to use
12:18 - white is the color of the
12:20 - the pen x and y are the positions we got
12:24 - from here
12:27 - and the size is the random size we got
12:29 - in destruction before this one
12:31 - okay with these instructions we are now
12:34 - ready to put as many stars randomly as
12:36 - possible
12:40 - the last thing we're gonna do is gonna
12:42 - put a little
12:44 - christmas message at the bottom
12:47 - so we're gonna erase the pen so we don't
12:50 - make any line that we don't want to make
12:53 - we're going to set the color
12:55 - to any color you want i'm going to go
12:57 - with red
12:59 - even though at the beginning of the
13:00 - video show you with yellow but
13:02 - just to show you how it looks a little
13:04 - bit different at the end
13:08 - i'm gonna move the pen to where i want
13:10 - to show the message
13:12 - i wanted to show it at the bottom so
13:14 - remember y goes
13:16 - up is positive and down is negative
13:19 - so i'm gonna go to negative x position
13:21 - as well so it doesn't
13:23 - go in one of the corners remember the
13:25 - message is gonna be quite long
13:26 - so if you do you need to do it a little
13:28 - bit to the negative side
13:31 - so it looks more centered of course you
13:33 - can play around with these values if you
13:34 - don't like the first result you get
13:36 - so let's do with minus 100 minus 180.
13:39 - this means it's gonna the message is
13:41 - gonna start a little bit to the bottom
13:43 - and a little bit to the left
13:47 - now we need to write a message to write
13:49 - the message use the instruction
13:51 - mypen dot right i'm gonna go with merry
13:55 - christmas
14:00 - now we need to specify a font for a
14:02 - message
14:03 - a font is just the type of well the
14:06 - appearance
14:07 - of the letters you're going to use to
14:08 - write down your message
14:10 - in my case i'm going to use the verdana
14:12 - font
14:15 - now i need to specify the size
14:18 - 24 or you can do 28
14:22 - if you want a little bit bigger and
14:26 - last last of all i'm gonna use the boltz
14:28 - font
14:29 - bold means letters are going to be
14:32 - thicker in appearance
14:34 - now we need to close the bracket and i
14:36 - need to close the other bracket
14:38 - okay now that i wrote my
14:42 - message i'm gonna hide my turtle so the
14:45 - twirl goes away
14:46 - and i can see my message without having
14:48 - the turtle
14:49 - be just hanging around so my pen dot
14:52 - height turtle
14:56 - now before we demo the project i'm just
14:59 - going to go through
15:01 - common problems you can encounter before
15:03 - running it
15:05 - sometimes python won't
15:09 - recognize turtle the screen so you might
15:12 - want just to
15:13 - use a screen instead another problem
15:16 - might be
15:17 - check the name of your variables okay so
15:20 - for example
15:21 - you might commit a typo like say number
15:24 - of start
15:25 - number stars make sure it's the same
15:29 - same with the functions run in make sure
15:32 - it's written just
15:34 - the same way as i did it do not add any
15:36 - extra spaces or capitalize any word
15:39 - that you haven't capitalized before
15:41 - otherwise python is not going to
15:43 - recognize your
15:44 - program and will not be able to run it
15:47 - last feel free to mix it up
15:51 - change it and do any other shape you
15:53 - want
15:54 - if you want to experiment and try to do
15:56 - a different shape for the stars
15:58 - go ahead if you want to make a six
16:00 - pointed star
16:02 - feel free to do it remember this is all
16:05 - about being creative and doing your own
16:07 - thing
16:08 - this is just the basis of our project
16:10 - and you can always change it up to
16:11 - whatever you want
16:12 - now i'm going to show you the final
16:15 - result for my project
16:19 - as you can see the turtle is moving in
16:23 - random positions
16:24 - and it shows the message in the end if i
16:26 - run it again
16:31 - i'm running it again and now we can see
16:33 - that the stars are
16:34 - in a completely different position from
16:36 - before and i have more stars now
16:39 - see now i have 10 stars i guess
16:42 - so that's all for today i hope you
16:44 - enjoyed the project
16:45 - remember to give us a thumbs up if you
16:47 - like it and don't forget
16:48 - to subscribe to get new tutorials thank
16:51 - you bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi everybody my name is fernando and today we're going to do a project on python turtle called christmas card in this project you will be sharing how to use functions and shape drawing in python turtle to create unique christmas card every time you run the project so as we can see right now we're adding the moon and a couple of stars in random positions which will in turn lead to the creation of our own christmas card you can send to your friends let's begin coding our project first of all for any python project we're gonna make we need to import the necessary libraries for it to work the first library we're gonna import is the turtle library because it's very essential to do a turtle project so from turtle import everything this symbol indicates that we're going to port everything that belongs to the turtle library next of all now we're going to import the random library random indicates anything that we cannot predict just to throw the result of throwing dices or the result of flipping a coin we want this so that the stars that we are going to show in our project are not the same stars or the same position every time we do a new card so that it's a unique card every time we do it we don't need to import the entire library we just need to import the rand instruction next we need to define some functions to draw the shapes that we're going to show in our project the first shape we're going to show is a circle the circle is going to be used to draw the moon to do that let's name it draw circle and we need to specify some parameters parameters are the things that functions need in order to work so the parameters for this function are gonna be the turtle we're gonna use the x and y position the color of the moon and how big the moon is gonna be so to name them we're just gonna use some easy names to recognize them turtle for the turtle color for the color x and y for the y position and x position and the radius to indicate the size of the moon the instructions we're going to use to draw the moon are pretty simple first we need to raise the turtle so it doesn't leave a line wherever it moves we ship that using turtle.pennad now we need to change the color of the turtle we use that turtle.color and inside the the color function we've got to specify which color we want to use next we're gonna fill everything that we draw the circle in with the same color we do that by telling the turtle to fill the color using the color we tell it to do in this case it's the same color as the function over here next we're going to move the turtle to our desired position so we just use go to x and y for the x and y positions we need to be next we're going to set the turtle down so you can start drawing turtle that pin down next we're gonna begin filling the the circle that we're gonna draw so the moon locks look solid and not just like a circle with some blue on the back or the color of the sky we want to use so we do that by doing turtle.beginfill next we're going to draw a circle that is going to be the size that we tell the turtle to do we already specified this in the draw circle function so we just do turtle dot circle to draw a circle and the size is gonna be just the radius size the last instruction for this function is just gonna be to tell the turtle to stop filling it everything that is drawing so turtle dot and fill the next function we need to define is a function to draw the stars this function is going to use the same parameters as the draw circle one we're just going to call instead of radius we're going to use the word size now most of the instructions are going to be pretty similar we can copy all of these instructions and paste them here we need we need to do basically the same things raise the turtle change the color change the fill color move to the starting position set the pin down and start filling it in the first instruction we're gonna do that is specific to the star is gonna rotate it to the right about 144 degrees this is just so the star has this specific pattern you know the five points of the star can be set up correctly now because we have a fivepointed star we need to repeat the same thing five times which is moving the turtle and making sure it goes to each one of the corners so to repeat an action we use a loop a loop is an instruction that repeats the actions that are inside of it the desired amount of times we specify it two in this case the easiest function to use or the easiest loop to use is gonna be the for loop for i in range five indicates that we're gonna do the instruction five times we're going to move first the turtle forward so you can do one leg of the star how big we gonna want to move it well we already specified it here in size so we just set it to move forward size pixels then we're going to make it turn to the right the same degrees 144. finally we're going to move it again for the size pixels that we wanted to move it doesn't look like it right now but when all of them move for five times they're gonna end up filling up the triangles that are gonna be formed around this shape we finish the function the same way as we finish the circle function and fill and now we add another function that says set heading 0 this function basically just specifies that we want to stop pointing in a random direction we just want it to point in the specific zero direction which is the default one for python turtle next on the list is we want to start coding the main part of the program so we can draw our christmas card the first thing we need to do is to create our first pen or our first turtle we're just going to call it my pen equals turtle this functions creates a turtle for us just just gonna give it a shape in this case you can just specify it for it to be the turtle shape so it doesn't look just like the triangle it comes by default i'm gonna set the speed this one is pretty much up to you how fast do you want it to look i'm gonna go with 10 so it doesn't look too fast or too slow now we need to create a window for the christmas card to be in window equals turtle dot screen remember the names of the variables are picked by you but it's very a good idea that you make them related to the thing you're doing so you don't confuse people that look at your code without knowing what you're doing now i'm gonna specify the background color for my window you can pick any of the default colors or you can pick a color based on this hexadecimal value if you want to pick a color but you don't know which one is the hexadecimal value of course you don't know with my memory you can always google it up in a color selector probably and you can find many pages three pages that can give you if you pick a color it will give you the value in hexadecimal value okay remember this is written like this exorcism okay now let's start drawing the moon to draw the moon we're gonna first make a white circle well how we do it we already have the function right my pen is the turtle white is the color name and then the positions well we're always gonna make the moon in the same position so you can always adjust this it's up to you okay this is the x position the y position and how big we want the move to be all of these values can be adjusted by you according to your preference now to make the moon being a quarter moon face we're gonna draw another circle using my pen with the same color as we have the sky so it looks like it is part of the sky you know like it disappears so we're gonna make it disappear we're gonna move it a little bit to the left so let's say 100 80 and 50. the more you move it to the left or to the right the more of the moon you're gonna show in the end in this case i'm gonna move it 20 pixels to the left so it leaves like a thin moon behind if you want to make it thinner or thicker you can modify this value of the x value so it changes the shape of the moon you can always play around with it now the number of stars are gonna be random so this is the first instance we're gonna use a random value okay we're gonna pick a random number between section six and twelve of course you can pick the random value yourself now let's begin to make the star it's always going to be the same function we're just going to repeat it a different number of times okay to do this we're gonna use a for loop again just as before for a star in range okay number of stars so for example if we got seven stars as a result of this random operation we're gonna do this loop seven times if we get eight we're gonna do it eight times now for the x and y positions well we're just going to pick a number remember in python turtle the zero comma zero position in the x and y axis is just in the middle so we need in negative value values as well for it to be anywhere in the screen we're going to pick a random integer between a negative number and a positive number we want in this case i'm going to pick minus 180 and 180 so it's confined to a little box the same with what the y value you can always speak different values for example i'm gonna pick a different one here i'm gonna go with a hundred the next thing we're gonna do is the size of the star the size we're also going to do it randomly so you should do it very quickly right now i'm going to pick a size between let's say 10 and 20. anything below 10 is going to look very small anything above 20 it's probably going to cover another start and of course we cannot control it because it's random but we don't want it to be too confusing to look at last of all in the for loop we need to actually draw the star so remember draw star is the function we're going to use my pen is the turtle we're going to use white is the color of the the pen x and y are the positions we got from here and the size is the random size we got in destruction before this one okay with these instructions we are now ready to put as many stars randomly as possible the last thing we're gonna do is gonna put a little christmas message at the bottom so we're gonna erase the pen so we don't make any line that we don't want to make we're going to set the color to any color you want i'm going to go with red even though at the beginning of the video show you with yellow but just to show you how it looks a little bit different at the end i'm gonna move the pen to where i want to show the message i wanted to show it at the bottom so remember y goes up is positive and down is negative so i'm gonna go to negative x position as well so it doesn't go in one of the corners remember the message is gonna be quite long so if you do you need to do it a little bit to the negative side so it looks more centered of course you can play around with these values if you don't like the first result you get so let's do with minus 100 minus 180. this means it's gonna the message is gonna start a little bit to the bottom and a little bit to the left now we need to write a message to write the message use the instruction mypen dot right i'm gonna go with merry christmas now we need to specify a font for a message a font is just the type of well the appearance of the letters you're going to use to write down your message in my case i'm going to use the verdana font now i need to specify the size 24 or you can do 28 if you want a little bit bigger and last last of all i'm gonna use the boltz font bold means letters are going to be thicker in appearance now we need to close the bracket and i need to close the other bracket okay now that i wrote my message i'm gonna hide my turtle so the twirl goes away and i can see my message without having the turtle be just hanging around so my pen dot height turtle now before we demo the project i'm just going to go through common problems you can encounter before running it sometimes python won't recognize turtle the screen so you might want just to use a screen instead another problem might be check the name of your variables okay so for example you might commit a typo like say number of start number stars make sure it's the same same with the functions run in make sure it's written just the same way as i did it do not add any extra spaces or capitalize any word that you haven't capitalized before otherwise python is not going to recognize your program and will not be able to run it last feel free to mix it up change it and do any other shape you want if you want to experiment and try to do a different shape for the stars go ahead if you want to make a six pointed star feel free to do it remember this is all about being creative and doing your own thing this is just the basis of our project and you can always change it up to whatever you want now i'm going to show you the final result for my project as you can see the turtle is moving in random positions and it shows the message in the end if i run it again i'm running it again and now we can see that the stars are in a completely different position from before and i have more stars now see now i have 10 stars i guess so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed the project remember to give us a thumbs up if you like it and don't forget to subscribe to get new tutorials thank you bye
