00:00 - hi everyone and welcome back to our
00:02 - channel here we share beginner-friendly
00:04 - tutorial videos on scratch roblox
00:06 - minecraft
00:07 - web programming and many more and today
00:09 - we're going to teach you how to make a
00:11 - scratch easter egg game
00:13 - today's game is going to be connected to
00:15 - easter this will be a platform game
00:17 - where
00:17 - the player is a rabbit and if we click
00:20 - green flag
00:22 - we can control the player with arrow
00:25 - keys
00:26 - on a keyboard if we go um
00:29 - if you want to go left we press the left
00:31 - arrow key if we want to go right we
00:33 - press the right arrow key
00:34 - if we want to jump we need to press the
00:36 - up arrow key and
00:38 - we can collect eggs and if we collect an
00:41 - egg
00:41 - our score increases then if we wanted to
00:44 - go to the next level
00:45 - we need to touch the star so if we touch
00:48 - the star
00:49 - then we go to the next level so the
00:51 - platforms are in different places and
00:52 - the eggs are in different places as well
00:54 - so let's get started um first as always
00:58 - go to
00:59 - scratch.mit.edu and you will land on the
01:02 - scratch homepage
01:04 - when you're out on the scratch homepage
01:06 - click create
01:07 - in the top left corner and this will
01:10 - bring us to the new project that we are
01:11 - going to create
01:12 - all right and as you can see there is a
01:15 - cat sprite
01:16 - um already here but we won't need it at
01:19 - all
01:20 - so you can delete it and secondly
01:23 - if you go to backrubs there will be
01:24 - another background that we will need to
01:26 - delete later
01:28 - so let's start from the backdrop
01:29 - actually um
01:31 - the backdrop can be anything related to
01:33 - easter really i'm going to choose
01:36 - a simple blue sky backdrop so
01:39 - i go to choose a background and i select
01:42 - blue sky
01:43 - and when the new background is already
01:45 - here i can
01:46 - delete the old one that way we can also
01:49 - have
01:50 - we can just have one backdrop for the
01:53 - whole project
01:54 - then the next step will be to create
01:57 - the sprites so if you go to
02:01 - the sprite panel you can have
02:04 - um there is a button called choose a
02:06 - sprite
02:07 - so if you click on the choose a sprite
02:10 - button
02:13 - you will see all the sprites available
02:16 - now i'm going to choose a couple of
02:18 - different sprites because
02:19 - in the game that we'll create a lot of
02:21 - things will actually be sprites
02:23 - um the player is a sprite which can be a
02:26 - little bit intuitive
02:27 - because the player is something that
02:29 - moves however
02:31 - the platform will be a sprite as well so
02:33 - that we can code it properly
02:35 - and and so will be the x and the star so
02:38 - let's start from the rabbit you have a
02:41 - hair and a rabbit i'm going to just rub
02:43 - it but feel free to
02:45 - select the other one all right
02:48 - and it's very very big as you can see so
02:52 - let's make it 50. so there is a size
02:56 - panel and you can change it to 50.
03:02 - yep here it goes all right so right now
03:05 - we need to choose a star sprite
03:10 - and for the star actually the star is
03:12 - pretty small
03:13 - and we don't want it to be very very
03:15 - difficult to reach to the other level
03:17 - so let's make it a hundred and
03:21 - thirty
03:24 - let's move it to the top left corner as
03:26 - well
03:29 - all right and here goes the rabbit
03:34 - okie dokie so right now all we need to
03:37 - do is place the platform
03:38 - and dx so again we're going to choose a
03:41 - sprite
03:42 - and there is no sprite platform
03:45 - if you look for a platform there is
03:47 - nothing here
03:48 - but we have another idea if you write a
03:51 - button
03:53 - you'll have a pretty rectangular button
03:55 - that
03:56 - serves perfectly as a platform as well
04:00 - so you can change its size to 75
04:04 - and it will serve as our platform
04:08 - okay and the last thing the egg now the
04:11 - egg is a little bit tricky
04:12 - because if you go to choose a sprite and
04:15 - select an
04:16 - egg you have an egg but it's not an
04:18 - easter egg
04:20 - you can use those and decorate it
04:22 - yourself using the paint tool that is a
04:24 - very good idea
04:26 - however you can also upload any other
04:28 - sprite that you like
04:30 - for me so i press back
04:33 - for me i'm going to upload my own
04:36 - easter egg sprite the link to download
04:38 - the image will be
04:40 - in the description box so feel free to
04:42 - use it as well
04:44 - so this time i hover the mouse over to
04:47 - the sprite button
04:49 - and then i go up without clicking
04:51 - anything
04:52 - and i select upload sprite when i select
04:56 - upload sprite my file manager appears
04:58 - and you can choose the location where um
05:02 - your image was downloaded so for a lot
05:05 - of you it will probably be the folder
05:07 - downloads and
05:08 - for me i save it on my desktop so you
05:10 - can see a beautiful egg
05:12 - but it's huge so um as always i'm
05:16 - changing the size and this time i'm
05:18 - changing the size to 10.
05:21 - all right so that's it for adding the
05:24 - basic sprites
05:26 - now we need to make sure that the game
05:28 - knows that the platform and the ground
05:30 - is the same thing
05:32 - um because both platforms and the ground
05:35 - are things on which we can walk
05:37 - and it's going to be important when we
05:39 - code it and
05:40 - for them to be in the same color so
05:43 - if you go to the backdrop again and
05:46 - instead of code select the backdrop
05:48 - bookmark scroll down a little bit
05:52 - and select the line um tool here
05:57 - and then you can change the thickness to
05:59 - 50.
06:00 - um you can choose a different color for
06:02 - me it's going to be black because it's
06:04 - the easiest to
06:05 - remember but you can choose a different
06:07 - color however
06:09 - be mindful not to circle the same color
06:12 - as
06:12 - the egg or the star or um the background
06:16 - because it's going to blur into one
06:18 - another and the game will not work
06:22 - so
06:26 - after selecting the color draw a line
06:30 - by dragging dragging the line from left
06:32 - to right
06:33 - from right to left and at the bottom of
06:35 - the screen
06:38 - then go to button and do exactly the
06:42 - same
06:43 - at the top of the button
06:46 - okay so right now we have um the same
06:50 - color on the ground and the platform
06:51 - and we're ready to go um
06:55 - you can also move the rabbit around so
06:58 - that it's
06:58 - just above the ground and the same for
07:01 - the egg it has to be just above the
07:03 - platform
07:04 - then if you have the button
07:09 - you can rename it in the top left corner
07:12 - to
07:12 - platform so that we remember what we're
07:14 - doing so it's going to make
07:16 - the coding a little bit easier
07:19 - okay and then we press
07:22 - enter
07:25 - and then
07:29 - we need to code four different platforms
07:31 - so we need to have four different
07:33 - platforms in the game
07:34 - so we also need to create four different
07:36 - sprites for each platform
07:38 - well even though they're not really
07:40 - different they will be distinct sprites
07:42 - that will have their own name and their
07:44 - own position
07:46 - so we right click on the platform and
07:49 - then click
07:50 - duplicate and
07:53 - again right click on the button and
07:55 - duplicate
07:56 - and the third one also duplicate
08:03 - when you have created all of those
08:05 - platforms feel free to move them around
08:08 - to design the level
08:11 - as you want
08:16 - so this will be my level design but you
08:18 - can choose any other design
08:20 - and as you can imagine i'm in the
08:24 - demo of the game we had three different
08:26 - eggs so we're going to
08:30 - also duplicate the eggs two times
08:34 - so that we can have three different eggs
08:37 - and place them slightly above different
08:39 - platforms or maybe somewhere in the
08:41 - summer in the air that's up to you all
08:44 - right so as you can see we have four
08:46 - different platforms three different eggs
08:48 - a star and the same color on the ground
08:51 - and on the platforms
08:52 - and this will be it for the design of
08:55 - the project
08:56 - so now let's get coding first we're
08:59 - going to code the rabbit movement
09:01 - but before we do so i'm just a quick
09:03 - reminder that
09:05 - if you like this video so far don't
09:07 - forget to like this video and subscribe
09:08 - to our channel
09:09 - and you can also check out all the other
09:11 - videos that we have created so far
09:14 - so let's code the rabbit first is the
09:16 - player so it's very important to code it
09:19 - um as usually
09:22 - click on the rabbit sprite in the sprite
09:25 - panel
09:26 - and if you're still doubtful whether you
09:29 - have the right sprite
09:30 - um selected you can take a look at the
09:34 - top right corner of
09:36 - the white place so there should be a
09:38 - rabbit there so if
09:39 - you see a rabbit then it means you're
09:41 - coding the rabbit so the code will be in
09:42 - the correct player
09:43 - in the correct sprite
09:46 - and the game starts as always when the
09:48 - green flag is clicked
09:50 - so when the green flag is clicked we
09:52 - need to go to the starting position
09:55 - and this can be done by going to motion
09:59 - and go to x y
10:03 - so the x and y positions will already be
10:06 - saved from the current position of the
10:07 - sprite so you don't need to adjust them
10:09 - if you want to you can but um if you
10:12 - just want this position
10:14 - then don't change the numbers here
10:18 - and the second thing that we're going to
10:20 - do is a little bit more tricky
10:22 - but it will make the movement much
10:25 - better
10:25 - so if we set the rotation style to left
10:28 - and right
10:29 - the rabbit will never flip upside down
10:32 - so it will only face left or face right
10:35 - but it will never
10:36 - go upside down when we move around
10:39 - so that's the first step
10:42 - and then we need to code what happens
10:44 - throughout the entire game
10:46 - so for the main game loop it's called
10:51 - we usually use the forever block because
10:53 - it has to run
10:54 - throughout the entire game so let's go
10:56 - to control dragon forever
10:59 - and then do two things first of all we
11:02 - need to add gravity
11:03 - so that if we are not on the ground we
11:06 - fall down
11:07 - towards the ground so
11:11 - if now we go to operators
11:16 - not on the ground so we are going to
11:19 - detect whether we're on the ground by
11:21 - checking the collar so if not touching
11:25 - oh not mouse pointer if not touching
11:29 - color and the color will be the color
11:31 - that you have selected for your for me
11:33 - it's just black so
11:34 - um i can click by the color picker
11:40 - and then if i'm not touching the ground
11:44 - color
11:44 - then i have to go down
11:48 - so again go to motion and change y
11:51 - by -10
11:55 - secondly if we are touching star 2
11:58 - so if we're just touching the star then
12:01 - we go to level 2.
12:03 - so we need another control block
12:06 - and if we are touching the star
12:11 - so for we're dragging the touching mouse
12:13 - pointer we might
12:15 - be mindful that this is a mouse pointer
12:17 - by default
12:18 - but we are going to change the mouse
12:20 - pointer to stop
12:23 - and then we need to go to level two now
12:26 - how do we go to level two
12:27 - this is actually a little bit
12:28 - complicated because we need to
12:31 - notify all the characters that they have
12:33 - to change their position
12:34 - so platforms have to move eggs have to
12:37 - move
12:38 - but for now we're just going to
12:41 - broadcast a message this is in events
12:45 - and we select a new message and the
12:47 - message name will be
12:49 - level 2 so that we know what we're doing
12:53 - all right so now we have the general
12:56 - rules of moving the rabbit but we do not
12:58 - have the movement to the left to the
13:00 - right and jumping
13:01 - so let's code the movement and let's go
13:04 - jumping
13:08 - this will be done by using different
13:10 - keys on the keyboard so let's start from
13:12 - the left arrow key
13:14 - when the left arrow key is pressed we
13:16 - need to move left
13:18 - now when do we stop moving left we stop
13:20 - moving left when we release
13:22 - the arrow key just like in normal games
13:25 - if you're pressing
13:26 - we need to go if you're not pressing we
13:27 - stop
13:29 - so let's wrap it around
13:33 - in a loop called repeat until
13:37 - and we will repeat it until not
13:41 - key pressed so the key is not pressed
13:44 - anymore
13:46 - and remember that we need to check the
13:48 - left arrow key as well
13:52 - then we go to motion so we point in the
13:55 - right direction
13:57 - and the right direction if we go to the
13:59 - left is going to be
14:00 - to the left so it's minus 90.
14:04 - and then we change x by
14:07 - -10 which moves us to the left
14:12 - and this is optional but it makes the
14:15 - rabbit look
14:16 - look really really really really nice
14:20 - so if you go to looks you have
14:24 - a block called next costume and
14:28 - this will make the rabbits change the
14:30 - costumes
14:31 - um in a cycle when they're moving around
14:35 - and this will make it look a little bit
14:36 - like it's running like a real rabbit
14:40 - all right so now because the right arrow
14:44 - key is going to be very similar
14:51 - let's copy and paste the blocks by
14:54 - clicking
14:55 - right clicking on the on the whole panel
14:58 - on the
14:59 - yellow side and clicking duplicate and
15:02 - then
15:02 - another one will appear then change left
15:05 - arrow to right arrow
15:07 - change direction minus 90 to 90.
15:12 - and change minus 10 to 10.
15:19 - and this is the movement so the only
15:21 - thing that's left is the jumping
15:23 - for jumping we will use the app arrow
15:25 - key
15:28 - so let's start with event and again
15:31 - when the app arrow key is pressed
15:35 - but this time we will not use the repeat
15:37 - until block
15:38 - this is because we will not use change x
15:41 - but we will use
15:42 - gliding to make the movement more smooth
15:46 - so we go to motion
15:49 - and then in the motion category you have
15:53 - a block that says glide to a certain
15:56 - position
15:57 - so we will glide
16:01 - for half a second to a position so let's
16:04 - change one second to 0.5
16:09 - and in the x we will leave the x
16:14 - position as it is
16:16 - and for y let's drag it here
16:19 - and then add a little bit to it so
16:22 - let's drag the plus operator and
16:26 - select y position plus
16:29 - 75 in this way the jumping position will
16:33 - be
16:34 - exactly the same but a little bit higher
16:37 - so it will not move left or right
16:42 - and when we have done that um let's
16:45 - wait one second
16:48 - so that we don't repeat the jump
16:50 - immediately otherwise it would be
16:52 - possible to double jump
16:54 - infinitely many times and it will be
16:56 - very easy to reach the star
16:58 - alright so this would be it for the
17:01 - movement of the rabbit
17:03 - now let's think of how can we code
17:05 - anything else
17:06 - so let's code the first egg sprite
17:12 - this will be my first egg sprite
17:13 - remember to check if you have an egg
17:15 - image here
17:16 - and when the green flag is clicked
17:21 - first let's create the score so we need
17:23 - to have a way to count how many x we
17:25 - have
17:26 - um we have collected so let's go to
17:28 - variables and
17:29 - make a variable called score for
17:32 - all sprites
17:36 - and set this variable to zero
17:42 - then we need to show the egg so even if
17:44 - we have eaten it in the previous game
17:46 - the game the egg will have to show up in
17:48 - the new game
17:49 - so let's show it
17:53 - and let's go to a certain position so
17:56 - every egg already has
17:58 - its own position so that's going to be
18:00 - the position for me
18:03 - and let's go to control
18:07 - and let's code what happens in the main
18:10 - game loop so throughout the entire game
18:16 - let's select an if block and
18:19 - if we are touching the rabbit this means
18:21 - that the egg has already been eaten
18:23 - so if we are touching the rabbit we will
18:25 - need to hide the egg
18:28 - so let's go to sensing
18:33 - and if touching rabbit then we need to
18:36 - hide the egg
18:38 - and another thing we'll need to do is
18:42 - increase the score of the player because
18:44 - they have eaten an egg so it's
18:47 - they should receive a point and is the
18:49 - goal of the game to collect all the eggs
18:51 - so
18:52 - let's go to variables again and change
18:56 - the score by one
19:01 - all right and that should be it don't
19:04 - worry if the x and y values are
19:06 - different
19:06 - because you have created different
19:08 - levels you might have different x and y
19:11 - now let's code the other two eggs so
19:13 - let's scroll down and go to egg two
19:16 - and again when the green flag is clicked
19:20 - we can show the egg
19:24 - and drag and drop the x and y
19:27 - go to x y motion block um
19:30 - if you don't want to code everything
19:33 - else
19:34 - from scratch you can go to egg
19:38 - and then drag and drop
19:42 - the code you have created into another
19:45 - sprite so you will see that it's tilting
19:47 - a little bit
19:48 - which means it have been selected so now
19:52 - if you go to act two
19:53 - you will see this block and you can just
19:56 - drag and drop it again
20:00 - so let's do the same for egg number
20:03 - three
20:04 - so let's start the game when the green
20:06 - pack is clicked
20:07 - then let's show the egg
20:11 - and let's go to the right position
20:16 - and then let's copy everything else
20:23 - okay and then put it in the right
20:25 - position
20:27 - all right so we should have all the
20:30 - xcoded already
20:31 - at least for the first level now
20:35 - we still don't have anything connected
20:37 - to the star so let's code the star
20:40 - and the star is going to be very similar
20:44 - so it has to start on the green flag
20:49 - as always
20:52 - it has to be shown
20:56 - and it has to go to the right position
21:01 - now
21:04 - forever if it's touching the rabbit then
21:08 - and we need to think of what happens
21:10 - next
21:12 - so if it's touching the rabbit let's
21:16 - touching
21:21 - the rabbit and then we actually need to
21:23 - hide the star because it's not possible
21:25 - to go from level two to level three
21:27 - anymore level three won't exist
21:29 - although you might want to create it
21:30 - yourself
21:32 - so we need to hide the star
21:43 - and we don't need to broadcast the
21:45 - message level two because it's already
21:47 - broadcast
21:48 - by um by by the rabbit so if you go to
21:51 - star
21:53 - this is more than enough so this will
21:55 - already work
21:56 - now we need to code the platform so that
22:00 - they start in the initial position as
22:02 - well
22:04 - so for every platform you see there will
22:06 - be a very very simple code
22:09 - when the green flag is clicked then you
22:12 - go to motion
22:13 - and go to the right position
22:16 - and again new platform
22:20 - when the green flag is clicked
22:28 - and then another one when the green
22:32 - track is clicked
22:33 - we go to x and y
22:38 - and the last one
22:52 - and in this way we can move the
22:54 - platforms around
22:56 - and change it to level two and when we
22:59 - press the green flag again it will still
23:01 - be level one
23:02 - so the positions that are on the start
23:04 - will be remembered by the game
23:07 - so next a little bit of design work
23:11 - again
23:13 - let's uh let's arrange our platforms in
23:15 - a different way
23:16 - so you can change
23:21 - the positions of everything
23:29 - okay and this will be my level two feel
23:32 - free to
23:33 - change it to any other level you you
23:34 - like
23:36 - and then when we receive
23:39 - message level 2 as was broadcast by by
23:42 - the rabbit
23:43 - we will have to change all the positions
23:46 - available
23:47 - so first of all let's go to
23:52 - the first button
23:56 - and let's select when
24:00 - i receive level 2 from the messages
24:04 - so when i receive level 2 and then go to
24:08 - motion
24:08 - and go to a new position
24:11 - and repeat that for every egg and every
24:14 - platform
24:16 - so when i receive level two
24:20 - drag and drop it you might be tempted to
24:24 - duplicate it however i advise you not to
24:26 - do it
24:28 - because then the positions will be
24:30 - duplicated as well
24:32 - which means you will not be able to
24:33 - change the position everything will be
24:35 - in the same position
24:43 - so the only thing i'm doing is dragging
24:46 - the when i receive level 2
24:49 - and go to blocks and
24:52 - remember not to delete anything else
25:05 - all right i'm additionally
25:08 - for the eggs there will be one more
25:10 - thing to do
25:11 - um because when we eat all the eggs in
25:14 - level one they should still appear in
25:16 - level two
25:17 - so for the eggs let's go to looks
25:21 - and let's show the eggs again
25:26 - so when i receive level two we go to
25:28 - position and then
25:29 - show the ex
25:33 - you don't need to show the platform
25:35 - because the platform and the platforms
25:37 - never hide
25:39 - all right so right now you should have
25:42 - all the positions set and ready
25:44 - and you can save the project now you can
25:46 - give it a nice title
25:48 - and this will be it when it comes to
25:51 - coding
25:54 - so let's see how our project actually
25:56 - works so
25:58 - let's click the green flag and as you
26:00 - can see we are in the first level
26:02 - and we can jump around with a rabbit the
26:05 - rabbit moves like a real rabbit so it
26:06 - changes the costumes
26:10 - and if we go up
26:18 - then we jump it's quite difficult to
26:20 - navigate
26:22 - um yep
26:24 - but if it goes to to to high it comes
26:27 - down on the ground
26:28 - and then if we um reach the star
26:32 - then we can go to the next level and
26:34 - play around with the next level as well
26:37 - so that's it for today thank you very
26:40 - much for staying with us
26:41 - and thanks for watching all the videos
26:43 - if you like this video

26:50 - you're waiting for the next one

26:53 - next time

hi everyone and welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly tutorial videos on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today we're going to teach you how to make a scratch easter egg game today's game is going to be connected to easter this will be a platform game where the player is a rabbit and if we click green flag we can control the player with arrow keys on a keyboard if we go um if you want to go left we press the left arrow key if we want to go right we press the right arrow key if we want to jump we need to press the up arrow key and we can collect eggs and if we collect an egg our score increases then if we wanted to go to the next level we need to touch the star so if we touch the star then we go to the next level so the platforms are in different places and the eggs are in different places as well so let's get started um first as always go to scratch.mit.edu and you will land on the scratch homepage when you're out on the scratch homepage click create in the top left corner and this will bring us to the new project that we are going to create all right and as you can see there is a cat sprite um already here but we won't need it at all so you can delete it and secondly if you go to backrubs there will be another background that we will need to delete later so let's start from the backdrop actually um the backdrop can be anything related to easter really i'm going to choose a simple blue sky backdrop so i go to choose a background and i select blue sky and when the new background is already here i can delete the old one that way we can also have we can just have one backdrop for the whole project then the next step will be to create the sprites so if you go to the sprite panel you can have um there is a button called choose a sprite so if you click on the choose a sprite button you will see all the sprites available now i'm going to choose a couple of different sprites because in the game that we'll create a lot of things will actually be sprites um the player is a sprite which can be a little bit intuitive because the player is something that moves however the platform will be a sprite as well so that we can code it properly and and so will be the x and the star so let's start from the rabbit you have a hair and a rabbit i'm going to just rub it but feel free to select the other one all right and it's very very big as you can see so let's make it 50. so there is a size panel and you can change it to 50. yep here it goes all right so right now we need to choose a star sprite and for the star actually the star is pretty small and we don't want it to be very very difficult to reach to the other level so let's make it a hundred and thirty let's move it to the top left corner as well all right and here goes the rabbit okie dokie so right now all we need to do is place the platform and dx so again we're going to choose a sprite and there is no sprite platform if you look for a platform there is nothing here but we have another idea if you write a button you'll have a pretty rectangular button that serves perfectly as a platform as well so you can change its size to 75 and it will serve as our platform okay and the last thing the egg now the egg is a little bit tricky because if you go to choose a sprite and select an egg you have an egg but it's not an easter egg you can use those and decorate it yourself using the paint tool that is a very good idea however you can also upload any other sprite that you like for me so i press back for me i'm going to upload my own easter egg sprite the link to download the image will be in the description box so feel free to use it as well so this time i hover the mouse over to the sprite button and then i go up without clicking anything and i select upload sprite when i select upload sprite my file manager appears and you can choose the location where um your image was downloaded so for a lot of you it will probably be the folder downloads and for me i save it on my desktop so you can see a beautiful egg but it's huge so um as always i'm changing the size and this time i'm changing the size to 10. all right so that's it for adding the basic sprites now we need to make sure that the game knows that the platform and the ground is the same thing um because both platforms and the ground are things on which we can walk and it's going to be important when we code it and for them to be in the same color so if you go to the backdrop again and instead of code select the backdrop bookmark scroll down a little bit and select the line um tool here and then you can change the thickness to 50. um you can choose a different color for me it's going to be black because it's the easiest to remember but you can choose a different color however be mindful not to circle the same color as the egg or the star or um the background because it's going to blur into one another and the game will not work so after selecting the color draw a line by dragging dragging the line from left to right from right to left and at the bottom of the screen then go to button and do exactly the same at the top of the button okay so right now we have um the same color on the ground and the platform and we're ready to go um you can also move the rabbit around so that it's just above the ground and the same for the egg it has to be just above the platform then if you have the button you can rename it in the top left corner to platform so that we remember what we're doing so it's going to make the coding a little bit easier okay and then we press enter and then we need to code four different platforms so we need to have four different platforms in the game so we also need to create four different sprites for each platform well even though they're not really different they will be distinct sprites that will have their own name and their own position so we right click on the platform and then click duplicate and again right click on the button and duplicate and the third one also duplicate when you have created all of those platforms feel free to move them around to design the level as you want so this will be my level design but you can choose any other design and as you can imagine i'm in the demo of the game we had three different eggs so we're going to also duplicate the eggs two times so that we can have three different eggs and place them slightly above different platforms or maybe somewhere in the summer in the air that's up to you all right so as you can see we have four different platforms three different eggs a star and the same color on the ground and on the platforms and this will be it for the design of the project so now let's get coding first we're going to code the rabbit movement but before we do so i'm just a quick reminder that if you like this video so far don't forget to like this video and subscribe to our channel and you can also check out all the other videos that we have created so far so let's code the rabbit first is the player so it's very important to code it um as usually click on the rabbit sprite in the sprite panel and if you're still doubtful whether you have the right sprite um selected you can take a look at the top right corner of the white place so there should be a rabbit there so if you see a rabbit then it means you're coding the rabbit so the code will be in the correct player in the correct sprite and the game starts as always when the green flag is clicked so when the green flag is clicked we need to go to the starting position and this can be done by going to motion and go to x y so the x and y positions will already be saved from the current position of the sprite so you don't need to adjust them if you want to you can but um if you just want this position then don't change the numbers here and the second thing that we're going to do is a little bit more tricky but it will make the movement much better so if we set the rotation style to left and right the rabbit will never flip upside down so it will only face left or face right but it will never go upside down when we move around so that's the first step and then we need to code what happens throughout the entire game so for the main game loop it's called we usually use the forever block because it has to run throughout the entire game so let's go to control dragon forever and then do two things first of all we need to add gravity so that if we are not on the ground we fall down towards the ground so if now we go to operators not on the ground so we are going to detect whether we're on the ground by checking the collar so if not touching oh not mouse pointer if not touching color and the color will be the color that you have selected for your for me it's just black so um i can click by the color picker and then if i'm not touching the ground color then i have to go down so again go to motion and change y by 10 secondly if we are touching star 2 so if we're just touching the star then we go to level 2. so we need another control block and if we are touching the star so for we're dragging the touching mouse pointer we might be mindful that this is a mouse pointer by default but we are going to change the mouse pointer to stop and then we need to go to level two now how do we go to level two this is actually a little bit complicated because we need to notify all the characters that they have to change their position so platforms have to move eggs have to move but for now we're just going to broadcast a message this is in events and we select a new message and the message name will be level 2 so that we know what we're doing all right so now we have the general rules of moving the rabbit but we do not have the movement to the left to the right and jumping so let's code the movement and let's go jumping this will be done by using different keys on the keyboard so let's start from the left arrow key when the left arrow key is pressed we need to move left now when do we stop moving left we stop moving left when we release the arrow key just like in normal games if you're pressing we need to go if you're not pressing we stop so let's wrap it around in a loop called repeat until and we will repeat it until not key pressed so the key is not pressed anymore and remember that we need to check the left arrow key as well then we go to motion so we point in the right direction and the right direction if we go to the left is going to be to the left so it's minus 90. and then we change x by 10 which moves us to the left and this is optional but it makes the rabbit look look really really really really nice so if you go to looks you have a block called next costume and this will make the rabbits change the costumes um in a cycle when they're moving around and this will make it look a little bit like it's running like a real rabbit all right so now because the right arrow key is going to be very similar let's copy and paste the blocks by clicking right clicking on the on the whole panel on the yellow side and clicking duplicate and then another one will appear then change left arrow to right arrow change direction minus 90 to 90. and change minus 10 to 10. and this is the movement so the only thing that's left is the jumping for jumping we will use the app arrow key so let's start with event and again when the app arrow key is pressed but this time we will not use the repeat until block this is because we will not use change x but we will use gliding to make the movement more smooth so we go to motion and then in the motion category you have a block that says glide to a certain position so we will glide for half a second to a position so let's change one second to 0.5 and in the x we will leave the x position as it is and for y let's drag it here and then add a little bit to it so let's drag the plus operator and select y position plus 75 in this way the jumping position will be exactly the same but a little bit higher so it will not move left or right and when we have done that um let's wait one second so that we don't repeat the jump immediately otherwise it would be possible to double jump infinitely many times and it will be very easy to reach the star alright so this would be it for the movement of the rabbit now let's think of how can we code anything else so let's code the first egg sprite this will be my first egg sprite remember to check if you have an egg image here and when the green flag is clicked first let's create the score so we need to have a way to count how many x we have um we have collected so let's go to variables and make a variable called score for all sprites and set this variable to zero then we need to show the egg so even if we have eaten it in the previous game the game the egg will have to show up in the new game so let's show it and let's go to a certain position so every egg already has its own position so that's going to be the position for me and let's go to control and let's code what happens in the main game loop so throughout the entire game let's select an if block and if we are touching the rabbit this means that the egg has already been eaten so if we are touching the rabbit we will need to hide the egg so let's go to sensing and if touching rabbit then we need to hide the egg and another thing we'll need to do is increase the score of the player because they have eaten an egg so it's they should receive a point and is the goal of the game to collect all the eggs so let's go to variables again and change the score by one all right and that should be it don't worry if the x and y values are different because you have created different levels you might have different x and y now let's code the other two eggs so let's scroll down and go to egg two and again when the green flag is clicked we can show the egg and drag and drop the x and y go to x y motion block um if you don't want to code everything else from scratch you can go to egg and then drag and drop the code you have created into another sprite so you will see that it's tilting a little bit which means it have been selected so now if you go to act two you will see this block and you can just drag and drop it again so let's do the same for egg number three so let's start the game when the green pack is clicked then let's show the egg and let's go to the right position and then let's copy everything else okay and then put it in the right position all right so we should have all the xcoded already at least for the first level now we still don't have anything connected to the star so let's code the star and the star is going to be very similar so it has to start on the green flag as always it has to be shown and it has to go to the right position now forever if it's touching the rabbit then and we need to think of what happens next so if it's touching the rabbit let's touching the rabbit and then we actually need to hide the star because it's not possible to go from level two to level three anymore level three won't exist although you might want to create it yourself so we need to hide the star and we don't need to broadcast the message level two because it's already broadcast by um by by the rabbit so if you go to star this is more than enough so this will already work now we need to code the platform so that they start in the initial position as well so for every platform you see there will be a very very simple code when the green flag is clicked then you go to motion and go to the right position and again new platform when the green flag is clicked and then another one when the green track is clicked we go to x and y and the last one and in this way we can move the platforms around and change it to level two and when we press the green flag again it will still be level one so the positions that are on the start will be remembered by the game so next a little bit of design work again let's uh let's arrange our platforms in a different way so you can change the positions of everything okay and this will be my level two feel free to change it to any other level you you like and then when we receive message level 2 as was broadcast by by the rabbit we will have to change all the positions available so first of all let's go to the first button and let's select when i receive level 2 from the messages so when i receive level 2 and then go to motion and go to a new position and repeat that for every egg and every platform so when i receive level two drag and drop it you might be tempted to duplicate it however i advise you not to do it because then the positions will be duplicated as well which means you will not be able to change the position everything will be in the same position so the only thing i'm doing is dragging the when i receive level 2 and go to blocks and remember not to delete anything else all right i'm additionally for the eggs there will be one more thing to do um because when we eat all the eggs in level one they should still appear in level two so for the eggs let's go to looks and let's show the eggs again so when i receive level two we go to position and then show the ex you don't need to show the platform because the platform and the platforms never hide all right so right now you should have all the positions set and ready and you can save the project now you can give it a nice title and this will be it when it comes to coding so let's see how our project actually works so let's click the green flag and as you can see we are in the first level and we can jump around with a rabbit the rabbit moves like a real rabbit so it changes the costumes and if we go up then we jump it's quite difficult to navigate um yep but if it goes to to to high it comes down on the ground and then if we um reach the star then we can go to the next level and play around with the next level as well so that's it for today thank you very much for staying with us and thanks for watching all the videos if you like this video um don't forget to subscribe and like this video and check out all the other videos while you're waiting for the next one thank you very much again and see you next time
