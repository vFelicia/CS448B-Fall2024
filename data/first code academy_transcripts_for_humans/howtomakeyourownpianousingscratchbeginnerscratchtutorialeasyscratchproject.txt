00:00 - hello everyone welcome to first code
00:03 - academy
00:04 - today we are going to make a simple
00:06 - project on scratch
00:07 - called scratch piano
00:12 - in this project we can play the scratch
00:15 - piano
00:15 - by pressing on a number key so when i
00:19 - press
00:19 - key number one it will play me
00:24 - number two three and moving forward
00:33 - [Music]
00:36 - to make our colorful piano keyboard we
00:39 - need eight colorful rectangle sprites
00:42 - to make our musical sound do
00:45 - re me fa so
00:48 - la si and do so let's see
00:52 - how we can make this project on scratch
00:59 - to start with the project i'm going to
01:01 - delete the cat spri
01:03 - so we are going to click delete on this
01:06 - cat
01:08 - and then i'm going to make the heading
01:10 - on the background
01:12 - so i'm going to click on the heading and
01:15 - then i'm going to click on the
01:17 - text box
01:20 - so i'm going to create a text box
01:24 - that is called scratch
01:28 - piano
01:31 - then i'm going to make it the text color
01:34 - to be
01:35 - black
01:39 - and then i'm going to stretch this
01:47 - to make the text a little bit bigger
01:51 - and then i'm going to place it at the
01:53 - middle of the screen
01:56 - tiger so next we have to make our eight
02:00 - colorful rectangulus price
02:02 - so we need to make our own customs price
02:06 - so we are going to click on the paint
02:08 - brush
02:13 - and then we are going to click on this
02:15 - rectangular
02:17 - paint block here
02:20 - and then i'm going to start with the red
02:23 - color
02:24 - spray
02:28 - i'm going to draw a small rectangular
02:32 - stripe just the size of that
02:38 - next i'm going to place it on the middle
02:40 - of the screen
02:43 - that's perfect
02:46 - so now that i have my first sprite i'm
02:49 - going
02:50 - to make the size a little bit smaller so
02:53 - i'm going to go ahead and change the
02:54 - size to be
02:55 - 17. so this will help us to have more
02:59 - space
03:00 - to have seven most price
03:05 - so in order to have our keyboard in the
03:08 - same
03:08 - size i'm going to duplicate the sprite
03:12 - block
03:12 - i'm going to right click on the sprite
03:15 - and then click on duplicate
03:20 - next i'm going to rearrange them
03:24 - and then i'm going to change my color
03:28 - it would be orange and then
03:32 - fill it so i'm going to repeat the same
03:35 - process to get my
03:36 - eight musical notes
03:40 - i'm going to duplicate and i'm going to
03:42 - rearrange them
03:48 - this time it would be yellow
04:01 - this would be great
04:40 - blue
04:43 - [Music]
04:55 - and our last musical keyboard that is
04:59 - the upper dough
05:11 - now we are going to build our code
05:14 - so first let's click on sprite 1 and
05:17 - then we are going to click on
05:21 - so to play our sound we need to press
05:24 - our
05:24 - key so key press
05:28 - is an event block and event block
05:31 - are some triggers that will cause use
05:33 - price to do
05:34 - certain actions in this project our
05:37 - event would be
05:39 - when you press on a number key it would
05:42 - make your surprise to play a musical
05:44 - cell
05:45 - our yellow blocks in scratch are our
05:48 - even blocks
05:50 - so now we need to add an event block so
05:53 - let's go to
05:54 - events and then let's bring the block
05:57 - call when space
05:58 - key press
06:02 - we are going to change the space key to
06:04 - be a number key
06:06 - so sprite number one is going to be
06:09 - playing
06:09 - by number 1k
06:14 - next we need to add our musical notes
06:19 - so in order to do that we need to add an
06:21 - extension to scratch
06:24 - so let's click on add extension
06:27 - and let's bring the music code blocks
06:32 - so next we need to add the play note
06:35 - block so let's click this block
06:38 - and then drag it and then we're going to
06:40 - snap them together
06:43 - so this would play
06:47 - c sound this is
06:50 - how long you have you can play the sound
06:53 - so i'm going to make it 0.5 beats
06:58 - so when i press on key one it would play
07:01 - me
07:01 - [Music]
07:04 - good job now we are going to repeat the
07:07 - same process
