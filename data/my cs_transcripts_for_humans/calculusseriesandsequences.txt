00:08 - okay
00:08 - so we're moving on now to sequences and
00:11 - series this chapter is
00:12 - a little bit different in flavor from a
00:13 - lot of the stuff that you've seen
00:15 - previously
00:16 - for sequences it's still going to remind
00:18 - you a lot of
00:19 - kind of limits at infinity like you did
00:22 - way back in chapter one right
00:24 - it's going to be very similar to that
00:26 - once we get into series
00:28 - the closest thing that we've seen so far
00:29 - that's kind of comparable to what we're
00:31 - doing when we deal with series is
00:32 - probably improper integrals where
00:35 - we're not necessarily just trying to do
00:37 - a calculation get an
00:38 - answer out at the end um we're more
00:41 - interested
00:42 - in whether something actually makes
00:44 - sense
00:45 - so as a sequence is just going to be a
00:48 - list of numbers
00:49 - a series is going to be what you get if
00:51 - you add up all the numbers in a list
00:53 - and by list here we don't need a finite
00:55 - list we mean a list that goes on forever
00:57 - and of course if you are adding up
01:00 - infinitely many terms
01:02 - then there's a good possibility that
01:04 - they don't add up to anything right
01:06 - um they they make kind of you know the
01:08 - values might jump around and
01:10 - never settle down to a value they
01:13 - probably add up to some infinite value
01:15 - if they do add up and so it's it's
01:17 - interesting just to figure out when can
01:19 - we actually add these numbers up and get
01:20 - something sensible
01:21 - right um so we're more interested in
01:24 - almost like existence
01:26 - questions now rather than computational
01:27 - questions and so that gets uh
01:29 - that gets a little bit tricky sometimes
01:31 - right it's a different philosophy
01:33 - um than what you've been dealing with so
01:35 - far um but we start with sequences
01:38 - we can give a definition
01:44 - okay so there are a number of ways of
01:47 - defining a sequence but the
01:49 - kind of definition that most people tend
01:51 - to give is the following so a sequence
01:56 - and i guess we should say
02:00 - you know we could consider sequences of
02:02 - other numbers we could consider
02:04 - we could consider sequences of complex
02:05 - numbers we even consider sequences of
02:08 - functions matrices vectors there's lots
02:11 - of things that you can put into a
02:12 - sequence but right now we're just
02:13 - looking at sequences of real numbers
02:17 - okay so a sequence is just going to be a
02:20 - function
02:27 - f so i'm going to write it like this
02:30 - it's a function f
02:32 - from the natural numbers
02:36 - to the real numbers this is one way to
02:39 - write it
02:40 - um so what do i mean here okay so
02:45 - what exactly do we mean by this notation
02:47 - if you haven't seen it before
02:49 - well what i mean is it's a function
02:50 - whose domain so here
02:52 - n is the domain
02:56 - the domain of our function will be the
02:57 - natural numbers okay
03:00 - so big n here stands for the natural
03:02 - numbers
03:09 - and depending on who you ask sometimes
03:13 - the natural numbers include
03:14 - zero sometimes they don't um
03:18 - we'll we'll allow zero because sometimes
03:20 - this can we need to have a sequence
03:21 - start at zero
03:22 - so we're looking at zero one two
03:25 - three four and so on right
03:29 - um and so the idea is basically
03:33 - for every natural number right we can
03:35 - write those out in a list and for every
03:36 - natural number on the on the list we
03:38 - write down a corresponding real number
03:40 - right so what we're going to have is
03:43 - something like
03:47 - say a0 a1
03:51 - a2 a3 a4
03:55 - and so on right so we might we might
03:58 - write it something like that
04:00 - so in other words we could say that
04:04 - f of a natural number
04:07 - is a sub n so a n here is a real number
04:11 - okay so there's lots of things you can
04:14 - think of here i mean you can just
04:15 - write down any list of real numbers and
04:17 - that's going to give you a sequence
04:19 - um probably you want a sequence that
04:21 - follows some sort of pattern right so
04:23 - we might look for something like know we
04:28 - might have something like this our
04:29 - sequence might be something like
04:31 - 0 1 4
04:34 - 9 16
04:38 - 25 and so on and maybe by now you've
04:40 - guessed the pattern right
04:43 - so in other words we can say here that
04:47 - f of n is just n
04:50 - squared typically we don't really bother
04:53 - with function notation for sequences so
04:54 - more likely how you're going to see this
04:56 - written it would be simply as
04:59 - a n is n squared okay
05:03 - so any any function that you can think
05:05 - of you can write down like this and you
05:07 - can
05:07 - you can get a sequence here's one that's
05:10 - uh that's sort of an interesting one
05:13 - we could do this one a n is
05:18 - cosine of
05:22 - n times pi so what does that give me
05:26 - as a sequence well
05:30 - it gives me cosine of 0
05:34 - cosine of pi cosine of
05:38 - 2 pi cosine of
05:41 - 3 pi and so on
05:45 - but we we know the value of cosine at
05:47 - multiples of pi cosine of 0
05:49 - is 1 cosine of pi is -1
05:53 - cosine of 2 pi is 1 again cosine of 3 pi
05:56 - is
05:56 - minus 1. so you get a sequence it just
05:58 - alternates back and forth 1 minus 1 1
06:00 - minus 1.
06:02 - another way that you could write this
06:04 - and this is typically how you would
06:06 - express this
06:07 - would be to say well it's minus 1 to the
06:10 - n
06:11 - right now normally
06:14 - powers of negative numbers are kind of
06:16 - tricky things we don't normally like to
06:17 - put negatives into exponential functions
06:21 - you know we don't like to have a
06:22 - negative base for an exponential because
06:24 - square roots for example of negatives
06:26 - don't make sense in fact
06:28 - you know most real number exponents if
06:30 - you have a negative base don't make any
06:32 - sense
06:33 - because for a real number base right we
06:35 - really you know
06:37 - it's one thing to kind of keep in mind
06:38 - is to remember that you know when we
06:40 - define
06:41 - a to the x right normally we mean e
06:44 - to the x times the natural log of a
06:48 - so if a is negative this doesn't make
06:50 - any sense right
06:51 - um but we can make sense of integer
06:55 - powers of
06:56 - any number right because this just means
06:58 - multiply minus one n
06:59 - times so that works right it's n
07:03 - minus signs you're just counting how
07:04 - many minus signs you have and of course
07:06 - if you have an even number of minus
07:07 - signs you have plus one if you have an
07:10 - odd number of minus signs you have minus
07:11 - one
07:12 - so you can do things like that right
07:14 - sequences that you might have
07:15 - encountered in a high school course
07:17 - would be things like arithmetic and
07:19 - geometric sequences where you just add
07:20 - the same thing every time or you
07:22 - multiply by the same thing every time
07:24 - right so something like you know adding
07:27 - just counting by 2
07:28 - 0 2 four six eight or or maybe you start
07:31 - at
07:31 - one and you add five every time so you
07:33 - have one and five
07:35 - or sorry one six eleven sixteen so on
07:38 - something like that
07:39 - right these are arithmetic sequences
07:41 - multiplying by two
07:42 - like we can do you know 2 4 8 16 32 64
07:47 - right geometric sequences we can make
07:49 - sense of those
07:50 - you can also look at what are called
07:53 - recursive sequences and we'll
07:55 - we'll encounter a few of these
07:59 - and this is something that you know is
08:03 - not a thing you can do with with
08:05 - functions of a real variable right so if
08:07 - the domain is real numbers this doesn't
08:08 - make any sense
08:13 - but if your domain is the natural number
08:15 - you can consider these so-called
08:16 - recursive definitions so you can look at
08:18 - something
08:19 - like maybe we need to define
08:22 - a sub 0 to be two
08:26 - and we say okay i'm gonna define
08:30 - a n to be
08:34 - let's say three times a
08:37 - n minus one plus one
08:40 - for each n bigger than or equal to 1.
08:43 - and then you can kind of work out what
08:44 - that's going to be right so
08:46 - you start off with a 0 is equal to 2
08:50 - right a 1 will be three
08:54 - times a zero so three times two
08:57 - plus one so i get
09:00 - seven right a two is going to be three
09:04 - times a one
09:05 - seven plus 1 so i get
09:09 - 22 and so on i can keep going
09:12 - you know adding more and more terms into
09:14 - that sequence
09:16 - generating those terms uh famous one
09:18 - that you might have seen
09:20 - fibonacci sequence right
09:26 - so the fibonacci sequence actually
09:29 - starts with two initial terms
09:32 - a0 is 1 a one
09:35 - is one and
09:39 - a n is just the sum of the two previous
09:42 - ones
09:43 - n minus one n minus two
09:48 - for each n bigger than or equal to 2.
09:50 - and so you can play around and you can
09:52 - see what sort of terms you generate
09:53 - there
09:54 - you get 1 1 and then 1 plus 1 gives me
09:57 - 2. 1 plus 2 gives me 3. 2 plus 3 is
10:01 - 5. 3 plus 5 is 8. 13
10:05 - 21 34
10:09 - and so on so this is a very famous
10:12 - sequence it's
10:13 - studied in a number of different
10:14 - scenarios there's even a quarterly
10:16 - journal devoted just to this sequence
10:19 - believe it or not so there's lots of
10:21 - interesting things you can do with
10:22 - sequences and there's a lot of stuff you
10:24 - can study with sequences and it's
10:27 - it's kind of a gateway into studying
10:31 - calculus
10:32 - more abstractly getting into analysis
10:34 - right the theoretical underpinnings of
10:36 - of calculus
10:38 - a lot of things can be understood in
10:39 - terms of sequences limits in particular
10:41 - can be understood in terms of sequences
10:44 - we're just getting our our toes wet here
10:46 - we're just getting started trying to
10:48 - understand how things work
10:49 - um we spend a little bit of time on
10:50 - sequences and then we're going to dive
10:52 - right into series
10:58 - okay so our first example just asks us
11:01 - to generate the first few terms in a
11:04 - number of sequences
11:05 - written here on the board all right
11:08 - this curly bracket notation is the
11:11 - notation that's used
11:12 - in the apex calculus books for four
11:15 - sequences so we're thinking of this if
11:17 - you like as a set i think is the idea
11:19 - behind the notation
11:21 - other textbooks will will put round
11:23 - brackets
11:24 - around the terms in a sequence other
11:26 - books will will
11:27 - do things you might find brackets around
11:29 - the a n
11:30 - you might find no brackets at all
11:33 - notation tends to vary somewhat on these
11:35 - um as long as we get our point across
11:38 - maybe it doesn't matter how we write it
11:39 - let's try to be consistent
11:43 - so with this first one we have an
11:45 - exponential on top
11:46 - 3 to the n on the bottom we have this
11:49 - factorial so let me just remind you in
11:51 - case
11:52 - you've forgotten the factorial you
11:54 - probably encountered it back
11:56 - when you were looking at tailored
11:57 - polynomials if you did study tailored
11:59 - polynomials
12:01 - along with linear approximations back in
12:05 - the chapter on derivative approximations
12:08 - you might not have encountered them yet
12:09 - depending on the order in which you see
12:12 - the material factorial is just the
12:15 - product of the first n integers so it
12:18 - means one
12:20 - times two times three
12:24 - and so on up to n
12:27 - all right or another way to define it
12:32 - is we can define it like this now one
12:35 - thing that's kind of odd we do actually
12:36 - define
12:37 - zero factorial oddly enough
12:40 - zero factorial is defined to be one
12:45 - there are a number of ways to understand
12:46 - why zero factorial should be one that we
12:49 - are
12:49 - not going to necessarily get into right
12:51 - now
12:53 - one of the reasons simple reason is it
12:56 - is going to make some formulas work out
12:57 - a lot better for us later on once we get
12:59 - to taylor polynomials and taylor series
13:01 - okay so zero factorial is one um
13:06 - one factorial is is also one and then
13:11 - n factorial we just do n
13:14 - multiplied by n minus one factorial
13:18 - for each n bigger than or equal to 1.
13:21 - all right so 1 factorial is 1 times 0
13:24 - factorial
13:25 - still 1 2 factorial is 1 times
13:28 - 2 times 1 factorial so you get 2.
13:31 - 3 factorial is 3 times 2 factorial so
13:34 - it's 3 times 2 times 1 you get 6 and so
13:36 - on
13:37 - right so
13:40 - with that in mind we come over here and
13:44 - 4 terms i guess we did the question
13:45 - doesn't say whether we should start at
13:46 - zero or one maybe we'll
13:48 - start at zero and we'll do five terms
13:49 - just to play it safe
13:52 - so we'll do n is equal to zero
13:56 - one two three
14:01 - 4 okay
14:05 - a sub n will be what will be 3 to the 0
14:10 - over 0 factorial anything to the 0 is 1
14:13 - so 3 to the 0 is 1 0 factorial we just
14:15 - said that's one
14:18 - okay i wish
14:22 - maybe equals is not the best thing to
14:24 - put here
14:27 - okay there's a1
14:31 - sorry a0 a1 will be 3 to the 1
14:35 - over 1 factorial so you get 3
14:39 - a2 will be 3 to the 2
14:43 - over 2 factorial so that's 9 over 2
14:48 - okay a 3 will be 3
14:51 - cubed over 3 factorial
14:55 - okay so that's
14:59 - 3 times 3 times 3 is 27.
15:03 - sometimes it's convenient to write
15:05 - things out like this because you can
15:07 - simplify a little bit cancel those
15:09 - threes
15:10 - it's also 9 over 2 okay
15:15 - and then 3 to the 4th over 4
15:19 - we have 3 times 3 times 3
15:23 - times 3 four times three times two
15:27 - times one
15:30 - we can cancel a couple of them that's
15:32 - going to come out to be
15:34 - 27 over eight
15:38 - all right um so one of the things you
15:42 - can see here
15:43 - is that initially the exponential is
15:46 - bigger
15:46 - right 9 is bigger than 2 27 is bigger
15:49 - than a
15:49 - but each time we we kind of proceed to
15:52 - the next step we're multiplying on the
15:54 - top again by 3
15:55 - but the number we're multiplying by on
15:56 - the bottom is getting bigger each time
15:59 - so the factorial is going to grow faster
16:02 - than an exponential right and we're used
16:03 - to thinking of the exponential as this
16:05 - very fast growing thing
16:07 - factorials grow even faster right so
16:10 - eventually
16:11 - the denominator is going to win here and
16:13 - we expect that these terms should get
16:14 - smaller and smaller and smaller if we
16:16 - let things go on long enough
16:18 - okay but there's the first four or five
16:21 - terms if you like
16:22 - one three nine over two nine over two
16:25 - 27 over eight okay we can come to the
16:29 - next one
16:31 - so a zero
16:35 - will be four plus minus one to the zero
16:40 - that's five right
16:43 - a one will be four plus
16:46 - minus one to the one so that's four
16:48 - minus one
16:49 - we get three
16:53 - a two well
16:57 - we're gonna be back to minus one squared
17:00 - even power again so we get four plus one
17:02 - so five and you can kind of see what's
17:04 - going to happen here right
17:05 - a3 will be three
17:08 - a4 will be five and this sequence is
17:11 - just going to jump back and forth
17:12 - between five and three so five three
17:14 - five three five three five three
17:16 - for however long you want to go all
17:19 - right
17:20 - let's come to this last one you might be
17:23 - worried about the
17:25 - the fraction here with the minus 1 that
17:27 - seems like trouble but it's ok because
17:30 - you know whatever number n is remember n
17:32 - has to be a natural number so it's
17:33 - either even or odd
17:35 - if n is odd well then n plus one will be
17:36 - even so one of these two is always even
17:38 - so we divide by two we still get a whole
17:40 - number
17:41 - we're fine we can do minus one to an
17:43 - integer power that makes sense
17:46 - so ah we better not start at zero for
17:50 - this one right
17:51 - we can't divide by zero so this one is
17:53 - definitely going to start at one so
17:55 - we'll do a1 a2 a3 a4
18:00 - we do have to pay attention to these
18:01 - things sometimes so a1 is going to be
18:05 - minus 1 to the let's see it'll be 1
18:09 - times 2 divided by 2 minus 1 to the 1
18:13 - over 1 squared so we just get 1
18:16 - uh minus 1. sorry a2
18:21 - we're going to get let's see it'll be 2
18:24 - times 3 divide by
18:27 - we get 3 right
18:32 - and so that's minus 1 to the 3.
18:37 - on the bottom we have 2 squared 4
18:40 - minus 1 over 4. a3
18:44 - we're going to have 3 times 4
18:48 - divided by 2. so 3 times 4 divided by 2.
18:51 - 12 divided by 2 minus 1 to the 6.
18:55 - okay over three squared
18:59 - nine so one over nine and finally
19:03 - a4 if n is equal to
19:06 - four we're gonna have four times five
19:11 - divided by two so we have 20 divided by
19:14 - two that's
19:14 - ten ten over two yeah sorry ten right
19:18 - twenty over two is ten
19:19 - so minus one to the ten it's even again
19:22 - over 4 squared 16 so we get 1
19:26 - 1 over 16 for that one and again we
19:28 - could
19:29 - keep going um here probably the main
19:32 - challenge is
19:33 - it seems like maybe it's a little bit
19:35 - hard to predict whether this thing is
19:37 - going to come out to be
19:38 - an even or an odd number as n goes on
19:41 - right the bottom we understand that's
19:43 - easy to understand
19:45 - um whether we should have plus one or
19:46 - minus one in the numerator we'd have to
19:48 - think a little bit about that if we
19:49 - wanted to continue this sequence on any
19:50 - further
19:56 - all right so next step is something
20:00 - certainly more challenging than the
20:01 - previous one so in the previous one we
20:02 - were given a formula and we just had to
20:04 - generate the sequence
20:07 - now we're we're given the first few
20:08 - terms in a sequence and we have to come
20:10 - up with a formula
20:11 - that generates those terms now one thing
20:14 - that's tricky here
20:15 - is you can't necessarily guarantee that
20:20 - your formula is correct right
20:22 - it might be that there are many
20:24 - different sequences that
20:26 - begin in the same way in fact online
20:29 - there's a database of sequences and you
20:32 - can go in and you can put the first few
20:34 - terms in
20:35 - into that database and ask it okay which
20:37 - sequences match the terms that i'm
20:39 - starting so we could go in we could
20:41 - go online we could find that website we
20:43 - could enter these and
20:44 - see what it predicts and maybe it only
20:47 - comes up with one answer maybe it comes
20:48 - up with more than one
20:49 - but we'll we'll try to see if we can
20:52 - find one that makes sense here
20:53 - right so in the first one we're just
20:56 - looking for a pattern
20:58 - 2 5 8 11 14 we say okay what do we see
21:01 - about these numbers
21:02 - well looks to me like we're going up by
21:05 - 3 every time right 2 plus 3 is 5. 5 plus
21:08 - 3 is 8
21:09 - 8 plus a 3 is 11. 11 plus 3 is
21:12 - 14 right so we can look at the
21:14 - differences we see that we're going up
21:16 - by three
21:17 - a lot of the time what you want to do is
21:19 - you want to look at things like what's
21:20 - the difference between
21:21 - terms right if i subtract them do i see
21:24 - a pattern in the differences or maybe
21:25 - maybe if i divide do i see a pattern in
21:28 - the
21:28 - in the quotients um so you try to look
21:31 - for any
21:32 - pattern any way you can come up with it
21:33 - you try to look for a pattern and you
21:34 - once you've
21:35 - got something that you think works take
21:38 - a guess at the formula
21:40 - see if your formula generates those
21:41 - terms right so
21:44 - in this case we see that we start at 2
21:47 - and we go up by 3
21:48 - each time so our guess is going to be
21:55 - that a n should be 2
21:58 - plus so each time we go up by n we add
22:02 - 3 so that should just look like 3n
22:05 - right for n bigger than or equal to 0.
22:09 - and we guess that and then we check
22:16 - all right so let's do 0 1
22:19 - 2. you can check that i still do the
22:21 - first couple you can do the last couple
22:23 - all right n equals 0 i get 2.
22:27 - n is equal to 1 2 plus 3 i get 5. and
22:30 - it's equal to 2 i get 2 plus 6
22:33 - i get 8. looks good right
22:36 - try the next one if i put n equals 3 9
22:39 - plus 2 is 11
22:40 - n equals 4 12 plus 2 14 works
22:43 - okay um so
22:47 - maybe there would have been other
22:48 - formulas that generate those first five
22:49 - terms but we've got one that
22:51 - it does the job so that works for us
22:55 - right and of course one of the reasons
22:56 - why we might want to come up with a
22:58 - formula like this is we might want to
23:00 - start looking at what's the long-term
23:01 - behavior right what can we say about
23:04 - this pattern
23:05 - for large n does the sequence have a
23:07 - limit as n goes to infinity these are
23:09 - the problems that we want to study soon
23:10 - so
23:11 - if we have something like this well we
23:13 - we need to have a formula like that if
23:15 - we're going to look at things like
23:16 - limits right
23:17 - okay so we look at the next one
23:21 - so one of the things that we might
23:22 - notice here is we're
23:24 - alternating signs each time right plus
23:27 - minus plus
23:27 - minus plus minus and so
23:31 - one of the things that you might
23:35 - guess for your formula is that if you
23:38 - see the alternating signs
23:41 - well maybe there's a minus 1 to the n in
23:43 - there right that's something that
23:44 - alternates sign
23:46 - so if we put that in there to deal with
23:48 - the minus signs then we can focus on the
23:50 - numbers without necessarily looking at
23:51 - the minus sign so now we have 2
23:53 - 5 10 17 26 37
23:57 - and we see if we can get a pattern there
24:00 - all right well
24:04 - not as simple as the last one but again
24:05 - maybe we look at differences five minus
24:07 - two is
24:08 - three ten minus five five
24:11 - right seventeen minus ten seven so we
24:14 - look at the differences and we notice
24:15 - the differences are three
24:17 - five seven again ignoring the minus
24:20 - signs
24:21 - 26 minus 17 9 37 minus 26
24:25 - 11 ah those are odd numbers
24:28 - okay so it looks like we're we're going
24:31 - up by an odd number every time right so
24:33 - we should add an odd number
24:35 - start at 2 and we add an odd number so
24:37 - what does that look like
24:39 - um so we're going to start at 2
24:43 - and we add an odd number so an odd
24:46 - number looks
24:47 - like two n
24:51 - plus one right every even number is just
24:54 - a multiple of two adding one
24:56 - gets me to an odd number all right and
24:58 - make sure that that's going to work for
25:00 - us
25:01 - we might have to shift things a little
25:02 - bit so if n is equal to 0
25:06 - we get 2 good right
25:09 - if n is equal to 1 we get a minus 1 here
25:13 - that's going to be three plus two we get
25:15 - five minus five yeah if n is equal to
25:17 - two that becomes plus one that's gonna
25:20 - be five
25:20 - plus two is seven ah
25:25 - doesn't that doesn't quite work does it
25:27 - um no no
25:28 - no because that's just getting the odd
25:30 - number so what we want to do is we want
25:32 - to
25:33 - take the previous number and add a new
25:34 - odd number in so that's not quite
25:36 - working is it
25:37 - so it's not as simple as that it's
25:40 - it's going to be more like hmm
25:43 - how are we going to do it let's see we
25:47 - got to take that we got to add the
25:48 - previous one
25:49 - so we're actually doing is doing
25:52 - something like this
25:53 - minus 1 to the n and then we're going to
25:56 - do
25:59 - we have that 2 at the beginning and then
26:01 - we're going to do
26:06 - is going to be 3
26:09 - plus 5 plus
26:13 - up to 2 n plus
26:16 - 1 something like that well that's not a
26:18 - great formula is it
26:19 - um does it work
26:22 - not really um oh but there's something
26:25 - that
26:26 - we might also notice
26:30 - yes there's another thing we might
26:32 - notice okay
26:35 - each of these numbers it's one bigger
26:38 - than a square
26:40 - okay now i noticed that because i
26:44 - happen to remember that there's a well
26:46 - maybe we should have noticed that right
26:47 - away
26:48 - but there is a formula that you can
26:50 - prove that says if you add
26:52 - up the first n
26:55 - odd numbers 2n plus 1
26:58 - what you get is simply n squared right
27:02 - start at 1 1 is 1 squared 1 plus 3 is 2
27:05 - squared
27:05 - 1 plus 3 plus 5 gets you to 9 which is 3
27:09 - squared 1
27:10 - plus 3 plus 5 plus 9 gets you to 16
27:13 - 4 squared all right now the way you
27:16 - actually establish that as
27:18 - truth is using a technique called
27:21 - mathematical induction you do a proof by
27:23 - induction which is
27:24 - not something that you're probably going
27:26 - to learn in your calculus course
27:28 - you're going to see that maybe in an
27:30 - introduction to proof's course
27:32 - or whatever your first sort of
27:34 - proof-based course is you're probably
27:35 - going to run into proof by induction
27:38 - so what we actually want here is to
27:40 - realize huh
27:42 - what we really should have is this
27:44 - should be minus 1 to the n
27:46 - and then we should do n squared
27:50 - plus one that's going to work
27:53 - right one squared plus one two squared
27:56 - plus one three squared plus one fourth
27:58 - squared plus one five squared plus one
27:59 - six squared plus one
28:01 - does the job all right so that was a
28:03 - little bit trickier
28:04 - all right um this didn't work
28:09 - that gave us the wrong answer right
28:10 - that's just generating the odd numbers
28:12 - but those odd numbers are the
28:14 - differences they're not the actual terms
28:15 - in the sequence
28:16 - so you say no that didn't work we go to
28:18 - this one
28:19 - but that's not a very useful formula
28:22 - so we find a nice closed form and now
28:24 - we're happy
28:25 - okay
28:29 - getting there next one now the next one
28:33 - i can spot just because i've been
28:34 - working with these numbers i know these
28:36 - numbers i know where they come from
28:38 - so i can write down the answer right
28:39 - away you might not be able to write down
28:41 - the answer right away
28:43 - but we can start thinking about them and
28:46 - say okay what's happening here
28:48 - 1 1 nothing's happening there then we go
28:51 - to 2
28:52 - then 6 and 24. okay so what's the
28:54 - difference you know
28:55 - how do these numbers compare two is
28:59 - twice as big as one
29:00 - six is three times as big as two 24 is
29:03 - four times as big as two right so
29:05 - we're doing times one
29:08 - times two times three
29:11 - times 4 24 times 5 gets me to 120
29:15 - 120 times 6 gets me to 720
29:19 - well i know what these ones are
29:23 - this is simply the sequence of
29:24 - factorials okay
29:26 - remember we we said that 0 factorial is
29:28 - 1 right 1 factorial 2
29:30 - 3 4 factorial 5 6 factorial
29:33 - it's just the factorial sequence okay
29:36 - not so bad one more to go the video is
29:39 - running a little long so let's
29:40 - dive right in and see if we can answer
29:42 - this last one
29:44 - we should have split this into two
29:45 - halves five over two five over two
29:48 - fifteen over eight it looks
29:49 - okay at first you can't really see a
29:52 - pattern here right
29:54 - um two two eight four oh it drops way
29:57 - down and then 32
29:59 - what's going on there um well one of the
30:02 - reasons why you can't see a pattern here
30:05 - is that we've reduced the fractions
30:06 - right
30:08 - so reducing the fractions is kind of
30:09 - hiding what's actually going on here
30:14 - five over two is the reduced form of ten
30:18 - over four five over four is the reduced
30:21 - form
30:22 - of 20 over 16.
30:26 - okay so if we don't reduce those
30:29 - fractions the numerators are going 5
30:31 - 10 15 20 25
30:35 - is multiples of 5. all right and the
30:38 - denominators are going 2
30:39 - 4 8 16 32 those are powers of 2.
30:43 - okay so on top
30:48 - 5 n on the bottom
30:52 - 2 to the n and n is starting at 1.
30:56 - all right let's confirm that it works if
30:58 - n is equal to 1
30:59 - we get 5 over 2. if n is equal to 2 we
31:01 - get 10 over 4
31:03 - which is 5 over 2 and is equal to 3 15
31:06 - over 8
31:07 - and is equal to 4 20 over 16
31:10 - works right we got it
31:18 - all right so in this next video we want
31:20 - to introduce the idea of
31:24 - the limit of a sequence we're going to
31:25 - look at limits before we move on to
31:28 - examples we need to introduce some
31:29 - terminology
31:30 - okay so definition comes first
31:38 - okay so
31:44 - we say that
31:48 - a sequence
31:54 - a n and the term that we use here is
31:57 - converge okay just like for improper
32:00 - integral so we're going to say that the
32:01 - sequence
32:02 - converges
32:07 - to a limit
32:12 - l okay
32:16 - and we might just say the limit is l and
32:19 - so we write this
32:20 - as limit
32:25 - n going to infinity so we only look at
32:27 - limits at infinity for for sequences
32:30 - limit of a n is equal to l
32:34 - if all right we're going to give the
32:38 - precise definition
32:40 - if for any
32:43 - positive epsilon
32:48 - there exists
32:52 - a natural number n
32:57 - such that
33:04 - for all n bigger than or equal to that n
33:09 - difference between a n and l
33:13 - is less than epsilon okay
33:17 - all right so the definition is a bit of
33:18 - a mouthful okay
33:22 - so the key word here is converge right
33:24 - or limit if you like
33:28 - here's our standard notation
33:31 - okay limit of the sequence is l
33:35 - so we get into this epsilon delta
33:37 - formulation
33:38 - again right for epsilon greater than
33:40 - zero
33:42 - there exists an n such that for every
33:45 - little n that's bigger than this fixed
33:47 - end right so here i think this is the
33:48 - variable this is
33:49 - some number um we have this inequality
33:53 - um visually this sort of makes sense
33:56 - okay so what we're really saying here
33:57 - when we say we have a limit
33:59 - think about things graphically right we
34:01 - can
34:02 - we can plot the terms in a sequence
34:04 - because we can remember that we can
34:06 - think of a sequence as just a real
34:08 - valued or you know it's a real valued
34:10 - function where the domain is just the
34:12 - natural numbers
34:19 - right so we can mark our natural numbers
34:23 - down
34:24 - and we have some
34:29 - value say l so l is going to be the
34:31 - limit let's say
34:33 - all right so
34:38 - let me just draw that line in
34:41 - y is equal to l okay and
34:44 - epsilon here think of epsilon as like an
34:47 - error right
34:48 - what we're saying is that you know the
34:51 - difference between
34:52 - terms in the sequence and the limit will
34:53 - be small okay
34:55 - so what we're saying is there for any
34:58 - epsilon so we can choose a large epsilon
35:00 - but
35:00 - typically we think of that as a small
35:02 - epsilon
35:03 - so here's l plus epsilon
35:07 - here's l minus epsilon
35:13 - right so we get this little strip
35:18 - of with two epsilon centered on
35:21 - l and then you start
35:24 - plotting the terms in your sequence
35:25 - right and so maybe the first one is down
35:28 - here like here's a1
35:30 - right and maybe a2 is up here
35:35 - and maybe a3 is down here and a4
35:40 - maybe it's up there okay a5
35:45 - is here a6
35:49 - is there a7
35:52 - lands inside oh great but then suddenly
35:54 - a8 is out again
35:58 - but then a 9 is inside a 10
36:02 - it's inside 11 is inside
36:05 - 12 is inside right so there's
36:08 - there's some value of n
36:12 - right here right
36:15 - so that once we hit there all
36:18 - the later terms in the sukin sequence
36:21 - are going to be uh within that strip
36:25 - and of course this is saying that the
36:28 - terms in the sequence they do have to
36:30 - get closer and closer and closer to l
36:32 - because if i shrink the strip right if i
36:35 - make epsilon smaller if i make this
36:37 - narrower well then i might have to go
36:39 - further out before i find an end that
36:41 - works but we're saying if we say that we
36:43 - have a limit of l
36:44 - we're saying that no matter how thin i
36:46 - make this strip i can eventually go far
36:48 - enough out
36:49 - so that everything stays inside the
36:51 - strip right thinner strip bigger n
36:54 - but i can always do it right eventually
36:56 - i'll always get inside this trick
36:59 - so that's what it means to have a limit
37:01 - in this sense
37:09 - all right so in the last video we
37:12 - introduced the
37:13 - notion of convergence of a sequence
37:15 - right so this is just whether or not
37:17 - um the limit of a sequence exists
37:20 - and gives a finite value as n goes to
37:22 - infinity right so
37:24 - if you calculate the limit and the limit
37:27 - is either infinite or the limit doesn't
37:29 - exist then we would say the sequence
37:30 - diverges
37:33 - if so a convergence sequence is going to
37:35 - be one
37:36 - where we actually get a number for the
37:38 - limit so that's what we're looking for
37:39 - here
37:40 - okay now one of the things that is worth
37:44 - pointing out
37:45 - is that if your sequence
37:48 - um
37:54 - if your sequence is
37:57 - you know given by f of n
38:00 - where
38:03 - we know how to do this limit the limit
38:05 - as x goes to infinity so if we replace
38:08 - n with a real variable
38:12 - x and we calculate that limit and it
38:16 - exists
38:19 - well then the limit
38:22 - as n goes to infinity of a n
38:26 - will agree right now that doesn't always
38:30 - work
38:30 - because there will be situations where
38:33 - this limit doesn't exist but we can
38:35 - still make sense of the
38:36 - of the sequence because there might be
38:38 - functions that you know
38:39 - for a real variable they're jumping
38:41 - around all over the place but you put in
38:43 - only integer values and things settle
38:46 - down
38:47 - but this does give a handy tool
38:49 - especially for something like this
38:50 - because we know how to do a limit like
38:52 - this right
38:54 - we know that if we were doing the limit
38:59 - as n goes to infinity of
39:03 - three n squared minus two n
39:06 - plus one over
39:09 - over n squared minus a thousand right
39:13 - if we had x instead of n here then this
39:16 - is the problem that you did way back in
39:18 - the very first chapter on limits right
39:19 - very beginning of calc 1.
39:23 - we'd say okay it's quadratic top and
39:26 - bottom right if the degree is the same
39:28 - on top and bottom we look at the ratio
39:29 - of the coefficients three over
39:31 - one we know that limit is three
39:36 - so it converges it converges to three so
39:38 - that's that's simple enough right it's
39:40 - good enough to do that i mean you should
39:41 - say
39:42 - something right say why is it three well
39:44 - because it's the same degree top and
39:46 - bottom and that's a rule that we learn
39:47 - right
39:48 - um if you feel like that's too easy and
39:51 - you want to show a little bit of work
39:52 - well you could always do that same
39:54 - trick that we did with the real variable
39:56 - divide everything by n
39:58 - squared right so you could write this as
40:01 - the
40:03 - limit n going to infinity of
40:07 - 3 minus 2 over n
40:11 - plus 1 over n squared 1
40:15 - minus 1 000 over n squared
40:18 - and you can use the limit definition you
40:20 - can give an epsilon n proof
40:22 - to show that the limit of anything any
40:25 - constant over
40:26 - n that limit is going to be zero same
40:28 - with n squared n cubed
40:29 - you know constant over any um positive
40:31 - power of n
40:33 - is going to go to zero so we get three
40:36 - over one in the limit we get 3.
40:38 - great you move on to something like this
40:43 - well this if you plot it it's an
40:46 - interesting thing because if you plot
40:48 - this
40:48 - function if you plus the sequence right
40:50 - i mean we know what it is a function of
40:51 - x so you get this cosine wave it
40:53 - oscillates back and forth
40:54 - um but if you start plotting the points
40:57 - for the sequence
40:58 - the textbook has the scatter plot shows
41:00 - you what it looks like well
41:02 - then it's a little bit different right
41:03 - because you're only plugging in the
41:05 - integer values so you're
41:07 - i mean you're getting points that are on
41:09 - that cosine wave right but only
41:11 - only at the integer values and and the
41:14 - cosine wave you know
41:16 - if we're just doing cos n it's not
41:18 - oscillating with an integer period
41:20 - right the period is a multiple of pi so
41:22 - things are going to actually jump around
41:24 - a whole lot it's going to be kind of
41:25 - funny looking
41:27 - but nonetheless we know for sure that
41:30 - this is not going to exist right
41:33 - so this limit diverges so this sequence
41:35 - diverges
41:37 - i mean we need to give a reason for it
41:41 - but one of the things we know is that
41:44 - well we know the limit as x goes to
41:46 - infinity of cos
41:48 - x that doesn't exist right because it
41:51 - oscillates back and forth between -1 and
41:53 - 1
41:53 - right we hit those values in fairly many
41:55 - times now
41:56 - we're not actually going to hit minus 1
41:59 - or 1 for this because we're not actually
42:01 - going to get
42:02 - to you know a multiple of pi over to
42:05 - multiple of pi
42:06 - right um we don't get to a multiple of
42:08 - pi um
42:10 - but we get close right um so somewhere
42:13 - along the way you know
42:14 - n's going to infinity we have all the
42:16 - integers in there so somewhere along the
42:17 - way we have we have you know three
42:19 - all right we have
42:23 - 31 314 right
42:27 - 3100 you know uh 41
42:31 - we have 3 100 or 31 000 415
42:36 - you know we we have these numbers which
42:39 - are very close to
42:40 - to multiples of pi right we can kind of
42:42 - add more digits of pi but before the
42:44 - decimal right so this is
42:45 - this is close to 100 pi thousand pi 10
42:48 - 000 pi
42:50 - right those are all even multiples of pi
42:52 - and then we could also
42:53 - consider you know odd multiples we can
42:56 - shift things a bit
42:58 - so we can get lots of values that are
42:59 - close to one we can also generate values
43:02 - that are close to minus one
43:03 - we can get all kinds of things in
43:05 - between right
43:06 - um so it's never going to get close to
43:09 - any value it's going to keep jumping
43:10 - back and forth forever
43:12 - so that's no good okay
43:16 - now you come to this last one and there
43:19 - are a couple of ways that you can tackle
43:20 - something like that
43:21 - one would be to to go to the to the
43:24 - definition or i mean you want to
43:25 - probably play around a little bit right
43:27 - and you say okay well the terms in the
43:28 - sequence are going to be i'm going to
43:30 - have like minus 1
43:32 - then i'm going to have a half then minus
43:35 - a third
43:36 - plus a quarter minus a fifth plus
43:39 - plus 1 6 right and so if you start
43:42 - plotting them you can kind of see that
43:44 - yeah it looks like they're going to zero
43:46 - because you have well one way to think
43:50 - about it is that you have
43:54 - we draw in here's y is 1 over
43:58 - x down here we can put in
44:02 - y is minus 1 over x right
44:05 - and and so the the terms in the sequence
44:09 - are going to be
44:10 - you know i guess the first one would be
44:14 - down here and then up here
44:17 - and then here and then there
44:20 - and there and then there right so you
44:23 - can see that they're getting closer and
44:24 - closer to zero
44:26 - the trouble is we can't actually we
44:28 - can't write this as a function of x as
44:30 - it is minus one to the x makes no sense
44:33 - at least working with real numbers it
44:35 - makes no sense now one of the things you
44:37 - can do is something that we observed
44:41 - initially here is a function
44:47 - that actually agrees with this sequence
44:49 - on the integers
44:51 - cos pi x
44:54 - over x right because
44:58 - multiples of pi right integer multiples
45:00 - of pi when you plug them into cosine you
45:02 - get either one or minus one like we were
45:03 - just talking about
45:06 - so there's a function of x that agrees
45:08 - with our sequence so at every integer
45:09 - and if you take the limit of that well
45:11 - we
45:11 - we saw that again but go back to calc 1
45:13 - methods
45:15 - squeeze theorem essentially is going to
45:16 - tell you right because the
45:18 - absolute value
45:21 - of this f of x
45:24 - right well absolute value of cosine is
45:27 - less than or equal to 1.
45:29 - so this is less than or equal to one
45:31 - over x in absolute value
45:34 - and so the function is sandwiched in
45:36 - between minus one over x on the one hand
45:38 - and plus one over x on the other hand
45:40 - we know that those both go to zero so
45:42 - this has to go to zero as well
45:44 - actually that squeeze theorem argument
45:45 - you can use that for
45:48 - for sequences as well that's perfectly
45:50 - valid right we can just say well look
45:52 - it's true that minus one over
45:54 - n is less than or equal to c n less than
45:57 - equal to one over n
46:00 - for all for all n and we know that that
46:03 - goes to zero we know that
46:04 - that goes to zero squeeze theorem says
46:07 - that this has to go to zero as well
46:08 - so we know that the limit as n goes to
46:12 - infinity
46:13 - of cn is zero so it converges
46:16 - and it converges to zero
46:23 - all right so here are a couple of
46:25 - theoretical results on limits that can
46:27 - come in handy the first one we we just
46:30 - actually employed towards the end of the
46:33 - the last problem the last example where
46:35 - we noted you know we had this
46:37 - remember what the problem was we were
46:38 - trying to do the following limit right
46:40 - we said okay we have this limit
46:42 - n goes to infinity of minus 1 to the
46:46 - n over n and we said well you know what
46:50 - we'd sure
46:51 - like to just sort of argue that since
46:54 - minus one to the n just
46:56 - goes back and forth between minus one
46:57 - and one it's bounded n is
46:59 - going to infinity so this is this is a
47:01 - number that's always either one or minus
47:03 - one
47:03 - dividing by larger and larger numbers
47:05 - that things are getting closer and
47:06 - closer to zero
47:08 - um we found a couple ways to kind of
47:10 - argue that yes that limit does indeed
47:12 - have to go to zero but here
47:13 - is is one theorem that kind of lets you
47:15 - do it quite quickly right
47:17 - if if a sequence goes to zero an
47:19 - absolute value then the sequence has to
47:21 - go to zero
47:22 - and it is exactly that same sort of
47:24 - squeeze theorem type argument that we
47:26 - gave towards the end of that solution we
47:28 - said okay
47:28 - well this just works because
47:32 - any any number
47:38 - is well it's either equal to its
47:40 - absolute value or the negative of its
47:42 - absolute value right so it's it's in
47:44 - between those two
47:45 - um and so if this goes to zero in the
47:47 - limit and that goes to zero in the limit
47:50 - well then this one in the middle has to
47:51 - go to zero as well right
47:53 - or if you like it's you could use the
47:56 - the definition right you could go back
47:58 - to that epsilon n definition and you say
47:59 - okay
48:00 - um well um
48:04 - we let epsilon be given
48:09 - and we can say that since since the
48:13 - limit
48:14 - as n goes to infinity of the absolute
48:18 - value of n
48:19 - is 0 we can choose
48:24 - n
48:28 - such that the absolute value of the
48:30 - absolute value of
48:31 - a n minus zero
48:36 - is less than epsilon right
48:40 - um but then you know just think what
48:43 - this is well i mean minus zero that's
48:45 - just
48:46 - so it's the absolute value of the
48:47 - absolute value
48:49 - but that's just the absolute value of a
48:51 - n right
48:52 - which is
48:55 - the absolute value of a n minus
48:58 - zero right so that same n is going to
49:02 - work here because really the
49:03 - the absolute value of a n is the same as
49:06 - the absolute value of the absolute value
49:07 - of a
49:08 - n right so that just get it right away
49:10 - with really no effort
49:14 - limit properties work the same for
49:15 - sequences as they do for functions right
49:17 - um if you have two convergent sequences
49:20 - with finite limits
49:21 - right then the limit of the sum is going
49:23 - to be the sum of the limits
49:24 - if there's a constant you can pull it
49:26 - outside the limit right so you can think
49:27 - of this as
49:28 - this is just k times the limit of a n
49:31 - right a limit of a product is product of
49:33 - the limits limit of a quotient is the
49:34 - quotient of the limits
49:36 - well as long as the limit of b n is not
49:39 - zero
49:39 - right so you can do all of these things
49:41 - um
49:42 - we won't necessarily go through the
49:44 - proofs in in a calculus class
49:46 - um again you might see them in another
49:48 - course uh maybe in an analysis course
49:51 - um probably just in a basic like
49:52 - introduced proofs course you're going to
49:53 - see something like that
49:54 - um the the proof for the limit of a sum
49:57 - is a
49:58 - is a standard one that you're probably
49:59 - going to encounter and it's a
50:01 - nice one to see um go through the
50:03 - details i don't know if we want to do it
50:05 - here we only have so much board space we
50:06 - don't want to make the video too long
50:10 - the let me i'll just kind of explain the
50:13 - idea of the proof for the limit of a
50:15 - of a sum right so for the limit of a sum
50:18 - right uh you're given so epsilon is
50:21 - given
50:23 - right and you're trying to make
50:28 - this difference smaller than epsilon
50:33 - right but i can rewrite this
50:37 - as a n minus
50:40 - l b n
50:43 - minus m just rearrange things okay
50:48 - and and if you redo and by the way if
50:50 - you're doing the difference you'd have a
50:52 - minus sign here instead of a plus sign
50:54 - and the next step actually is the same
50:56 - you have the triangle inequality the
50:58 - absolute value of a sum
51:00 - is always less than or equal to the sum
51:03 - of the absolute values
51:07 - all right so you can get something like
51:08 - that and so i'm not going to write up
51:11 - all the details of the proof obviously i
51:12 - don't have broom
51:13 - but essentially the way you would
51:15 - proceed is you say okay i'm given the
51:16 - epsilon
51:18 - now i got to choose my n and you say
51:21 - okay well
51:22 - look um i know that this limit
51:26 - exists right that limit is l right so a
51:29 - n converges to l
51:31 - so i know that from here i can choose
51:35 - i can choose some n1 that makes this
51:38 - absolute value less than epsilon
51:40 - i can choose
51:44 - an n 2 that makes this difference
51:48 - less than epsilon right because i know
51:50 - that those two sequences converge
51:54 - and then what i do is i choose
51:58 - i choose n to be whichever of those is
52:02 - bigger
52:04 - and one and two right
52:07 - so that means that if little n is is
52:10 - bigger than big n well then it's bigger
52:11 - than
52:12 - both of these and so i know that that
52:14 - difference is less than epsilon i know
52:16 - that that difference is less than
52:17 - epsilon
52:18 - oh except you know then that the sum is
52:21 - going to be 2 epsilon and that's not
52:22 - quite what we want so we say hey
52:23 - actually we can choose these
52:25 - so that this will be less than not just
52:28 - epsilon but that'll be less than epsilon
52:30 - over 2.
52:31 - and we choose so this is less than
52:34 - epsilon over 2.
52:36 - and so then when we add them together we
52:38 - get that epsilon right
52:40 - that's a that's a standard kind of
52:42 - argument that you use
52:43 - for doing epsilon delta proofs with sums
52:46 - or differences
52:53 - all right so in this example we're going
52:55 - to work with
52:56 - some of the limit properties for limits
52:58 - of sequences that we saw in the previous
53:00 - video
53:01 - we're given three sequences we're told
53:03 - their limits okay
53:05 - um some of these i mean we can work
53:07 - these out if we absolutely had to but
53:08 - they're they're given to us right um
53:10 - here
53:11 - you know if we wrote all of these as
53:13 - functions of x and we think about taking
53:15 - the limit as x goes to infinity
53:17 - we know how to handle this it's just a
53:18 - rational function degree is bigger on
53:20 - the bottom so yes the limit should be
53:22 - zero
53:23 - um this one here um this is interesting
53:26 - right that is like base e
53:27 - from like the natural exponential
53:29 - function right that's euler's number
53:31 - um some people will actually take this
53:34 - as the definition of e
53:35 - which is interesting but you can show
53:37 - that the limit is equal to e
53:38 - using um using l'hopital's rule
53:42 - right techniques for indeterminate forms
53:44 - because this is something of the form
53:46 - one to the infinity that's one of the
53:48 - forms that we know how to handle
53:51 - finally here this one's a little bit
53:53 - tricky
53:55 - if you try to take the limit well let's
53:57 - see n is going to infinity
53:58 - five over n is going to zero so it's
54:00 - like infinity times zero
54:02 - um oh but if we if we wrote this as sine
54:05 - five over n
54:06 - you know if we think of this as sine 5
54:09 - over n divided by 1 over
54:13 - n oh now it's a 0 over 0 limit and in
54:17 - fact
54:17 - if we put a 5 here and a 5 here
54:21 - well now this is like a sine theta over
54:23 - theta limit right we know that limit as
54:25 - you know if n goes to infinity five over
54:28 - n goes to zero so we know that this
54:29 - this limit here is is one so five times
54:32 - one so that makes sense
54:34 - okay so we have these limits now
54:37 - we want to calculate these results over
54:39 - here and the point is once we know the
54:40 - value of the limits we don't need to get
54:42 - into the details we just need to apply
54:44 - limit properties
54:46 - so this one here well we know that the
54:48 - limit of a sum
54:50 - is the sum of the limits so we can write
54:52 - limit as n goes to infinity of a
54:54 - n
54:57 - plus the limit as n goes to infinity of
54:59 - b n
55:01 - and the first limit is zero
55:04 - the second limit is e and so the result
55:08 - is going to be e
55:09 - right similarly here we have a product
55:13 - limit of a product is product of the
55:15 - limits
55:19 - as long as these two limits
55:22 - exist independently right we can have
55:25 - situations where
55:26 - where this limit does exist but these
55:27 - limits don't and then you got to be a
55:29 - bit more careful
55:31 - so we can do that okay and limit of b
55:34 - n is e limit of c n is five so e
55:38 - times five or maybe we would prefer to
55:41 - write that as five e
55:42 - okay and last one we have a constant
55:46 - multiple so if you have a constant
55:47 - multiple you can bring it outside the
55:49 - limit so this is one thousand
55:52 - times the limit as n goes to infinity
55:56 - of a n so it's one thousand
56:00 - times 0 which is 0.
56:03 - right so it's not so bad
56:10 - so the next thing that we're going to
56:11 - look at is
56:13 - what it means for a sequence to be
56:16 - bounded
56:17 - okay so here's the definition
56:22 - okay so we'll have a sequence let's say
56:25 - a
56:28 - n
56:32 - and we'll say that it's bounded
56:39 - if it's underline bounded
56:42 - so it's bounded if
56:46 - there are constants
56:51 - let's say little m and big m
56:57 - such that a n
57:00 - each term in the sequence a n
57:04 - is always between little m and big m so
57:08 - little m is your lower bound
57:09 - big m is your upper bound and of course
57:13 - we need that to hold for all
57:17 - natural numbers right it's for all n
57:20 - equal to 1 2 3 and so on
57:24 - we require every single term in the
57:25 - sequence to be between these two bounds
57:28 - okay so that's a relatively
57:31 - straightforward definition
57:33 - visually you can sort of think about how
57:35 - this
57:36 - looks right um if you plot the terms in
57:39 - your sequence
57:41 - you have some
57:44 - upper bound big m
57:49 - some lower bound little m and
57:53 - every term in the sequence has to lie in
57:57 - between those two bounds
57:59 - okay so we come over here to this
58:01 - example we've got a couple of sequences
58:03 - we want to decide whether or not these
58:05 - are bounded
58:06 - uh it becomes pretty clear once you
58:07 - start writing out terms in the sequence
58:10 - right so here we have
58:14 - one one half
58:18 - one third one over four and so on
58:22 - um so in particular they keep getting
58:24 - smaller
58:25 - right and i think it's pretty clear here
58:31 - that we have one over
58:34 - n less than or equal to 1
58:39 - for all and bigger than or equal to 1.
58:43 - in fact if you just take reciprocal of
58:45 - both sides right if you
58:47 - if you have an inequality involving
58:48 - positive numbers and you take
58:50 - reciprocals the inequality reverses and
58:52 - done okay on the other hand if we come
58:55 - over to here you look at the sequences
58:57 - right two maybe we start at two to the
59:00 - zero so one
59:01 - two four 8
59:04 - 16. so on um these are not going to be
59:09 - bounded right
59:10 - there they grow without bound it's an
59:12 - exponential function
59:13 - we know in fact we know that the limit
59:18 - as n goes to infinity of 2 to the n
59:23 - is infinite so there can't possibly be
59:26 - an upper bound right
59:27 - these numbers grow without bound
59:34 - all right so in this video we're going
59:36 - to discuss a theorem related to
59:38 - bounded sequences the theorem says that
59:41 - every
59:41 - convergent sequence is bounded
59:45 - so in other words
59:49 - if the limit as
59:52 - n goes to infinity of a n is equal to l
59:57 - and l is some finite value
60:01 - right l is less than infinity
60:04 - then the sequence a n
60:10 - is bounded
60:13 - right that's what it says um now be
60:16 - careful uh
60:17 - this does not say that every bounded
60:19 - sequence is convergent it says every
60:21 - convergence sequence is bounded so you
60:23 - got to be careful those are two
60:24 - different statements
60:26 - one is true one is false this one is
60:28 - true and let me show you why
60:30 - um we'll actually prove this
60:36 - so let's suppose
60:40 - that the limit as
60:43 - n goes to infinity of a
60:46 - n is equal to l okay
60:51 - um now let's think about the the
60:53 - definition of convergence right
60:55 - definition says for every epsilon i can
60:58 - choose a capital n
60:59 - so that for every little n bigger than
61:01 - that capital n
61:03 - the difference between a n and l will be
61:05 - less than epsilon
61:06 - so i can choose any epsilon because i
61:09 - know this limit exists
61:14 - so if i take epsilon equal to one
61:20 - there has to be some
61:24 - capital n
61:28 - such that the absolute value of a
61:32 - n minus l is less than one
61:37 - for all n
61:40 - bigger than or equal to big n
61:46 - now another way to rewrite this is to
61:49 - say well that means that
61:52 - this difference is between minus one and
61:54 - one
61:55 - and if i add l to everything that means
61:58 - that
61:59 - minus one plus l is less than a n
62:02 - is less than one plus
62:06 - l right or so a n is between l plus one
62:09 - and l minus one
62:10 - okay uh but only only for those values
62:13 - of n that are bigger than or equal to
62:14 - this
62:15 - capital n right what about the ones that
62:17 - came before well the ones that came
62:18 - before
62:19 - are a finite list right
62:22 - so basically what we do
62:25 - is we're going to let
62:29 - big m be the maximum
62:35 - of all the numbers a1 a2
62:39 - a3 and so on down
62:42 - to a
62:46 - let's say n maybe you want to go n minus
62:48 - 1 if you want but
62:49 - it's fine let's leave it in and also
62:54 - we throw in l plus one and we can let
63:01 - little m be the minimum of a1
63:05 - a2 a3
63:09 - down to a n and then l
63:13 - minus one right and
63:17 - so essentially that's it you if
63:22 - if we take you know any term in the
63:24 - sequence any a n in the sequence
63:26 - um well
63:29 - then it has to be less than or equal to
63:32 - the biggest of these numbers
63:33 - if it's you know so if it's one of those
63:35 - terms it has to be less than or equal to
63:37 - one of these right whichever one of
63:38 - those is biggest and
63:40 - if we take an a n for little and bigger
63:43 - than this capital n
63:44 - well then we know that a n has to be
63:46 - smaller than l plus one right
63:48 - so whichever one of these numbers is
63:50 - biggest that's the upper bound
63:52 - similar whichever one of these numbers
63:53 - is smallest is is going to be the lower
63:55 - bound
63:56 - so we know that a n has to be in between
63:58 - for each value of n
64:00 - and that proves the theorem okay so
64:02 - every convergence sequence has a bound
64:05 - we've just demonstrated it but not every
64:08 - bounded sequence converges right um a
64:12 - good example of that is you just take
64:14 - take like the sequence minus one to the
64:16 - n it's bounded right
64:18 - it's always between minus one and one
64:19 - but it goes back and forth forever it
64:21 - never comes settles down to a limit
64:24 - so there are bounded sequences that
64:25 - don't converge
64:27 - we can add one more condition that does
64:29 - guarantee convergence and that's what
64:31 - we're going to talk about
64:32 - in the next video
64:38 - so the next thing that we want to talk
64:39 - about is
64:41 - monotone sequences so this is a
64:43 - definition
64:48 - has two parts so part one
64:53 - part 2.
64:57 - so
65:01 - a sequence
65:04 - a n is
65:09 - monotone increasing
65:16 - if a n is less than or equal to
65:21 - a n plus 1 for
65:24 - all
65:28 - natural numbers n and similarly
65:32 - it's decreasing
65:45 - if a n is bigger than or equal to
65:49 - a n plus 1
65:52 - for all natural numbers n
65:55 - right so it's a very simple concept it
65:59 - aligns fairly well with
66:00 - you know what we understand for
66:01 - increasing decreasing functions
66:03 - although we do allow we don't insist on
66:06 - a strict inequality here we allow less
66:08 - than or equal
66:08 - when we're dealing with moderate with
66:10 - sequences so monotone increasing
66:12 - monotone decreasing
66:13 - right this condition here just says that
66:15 - the next term in the sequence
66:17 - has to be at least as big as the
66:18 - previous term right here the next term
66:20 - in the sequence
66:21 - is less than or equal so these ones are
66:23 - getting smaller these ones are getting
66:24 - bigger
66:25 - simple enough right so there's an
66:28 - important theorem
66:36 - related to monotone sequences bounded
66:38 - monotone sequences
66:40 - which says so and collectively we can
66:42 - say monotone if it's either monotone
66:44 - increasing or monotone decreasing
66:46 - and the theorem says the following the
66:49 - theorem says
66:52 - every bounded
66:58 - monotone sequence
67:05 - converges
67:10 - okay so that's what the theorem states
67:14 - so we mentioned before this previous
67:16 - theorem we proved that every convergence
67:17 - sequence has to be bounded
67:19 - and i warned that the converse is not
67:21 - true right every bounded sequence is not
67:22 - necessarily convergent
67:25 - but if we do have a bounded monotone
67:27 - sequence
67:28 - right the added condition of mono
67:30 - monotonicity guarantees that you can't
67:32 - have this sequence that's jumping back
67:34 - and forth right
67:35 - because it always has to be going up or
67:37 - always going down
67:39 - okay and so you're guaranteed
67:42 - convergence for every bounded monotone
67:43 - sequence
67:44 - um we're not going to prove this theorem
67:46 - because
67:47 - a proof requires actually getting into
67:50 - you know um careful sort of axiomatic
67:53 - definition of the real numbers you have
67:55 - to talk about least upper bounds
67:56 - least upper bound property of the real
67:58 - numbers
67:59 - but intuitively it's pretty clear why
68:03 - this has to work right
68:04 - so if we think about a bounded
68:08 - monotone increasing sequence right so if
68:11 - it's increasing
68:12 - and bounded above
68:18 - right if that's our upper bound
68:21 - and our sequence is increasing so maybe
68:24 - we start here
68:26 - we go up it's increasing it's increasing
68:29 - right but we can't pass n right
68:32 - so each term has to get bigger
68:35 - but we can't get any bigger than m
68:41 - all right we can't go back down because
68:44 - then we wouldn't be monotonous
68:45 - increasing
68:46 - we can't cross m because it's an upper
68:49 - bound
68:50 - right and so the idea here is is the way
68:52 - you would prove this is
68:53 - um one of the properties that the real
68:56 - numbers have is that any
68:57 - sequence that is bounded above has a
68:59 - least upper bound
69:01 - and so basically you would say well look
69:04 - here's uh here's a sequence of numbers
69:06 - it's bounded above
69:07 - we look for the least upper bound and
69:09 - you can prove that that loose upper
69:10 - bound has to be the limit
69:12 - right but then you've got to get into
69:13 - this discussion of least upper bound
69:15 - properties
69:16 - and of course for a sequence which is
69:19 - monotone
69:20 - decreasing and bounded below well it's
69:22 - going to do the same sort of thing right
69:24 - it's going to decrease down
69:25 - until we get closer and closer to that
69:28 - lower bound but we can't pass it
69:30 - so we approach whatever the greatest
69:32 - lower bound is and that's going to be
69:33 - the limit
69:40 - all right so here are four sequences
69:44 - we want to decide if these are monotone
69:47 - increasing
69:48 - monotone decreasing because we're
69:50 - interested in
69:51 - whether we can apply this theorem we've
69:53 - just discussed right
69:55 - we have a theorem says every bounded
69:58 - monotone sequence converges
70:00 - and so if we can identify when a
70:01 - sequence is bounded and monotone
70:04 - well then we have a very powerful tool
70:06 - for determining convergence of a
70:07 - sequence
70:09 - so let's look at these the first one is
70:11 - pretty straightforward
70:13 - and we might notice that
70:16 - n plus 1 over n can be written as
70:20 - 1 plus 1 over n and
70:24 - it's also pretty clear that the this is
70:27 - going to be decreasing right because
70:29 - as n gets bigger one over n gets smaller
70:32 - and so this is going to be
70:36 - going to be decreasing
70:39 - well maybe that's not a very
70:42 - water tight argument you know it's
70:44 - essentially appealing to the fact that
70:46 - these terms lie on the graph y is one
70:49 - over x
70:50 - we know that that's decreasing so we go
70:54 - with it right
70:54 - uh now there's a couple of ways that you
70:56 - could actually
70:59 - establish this right so one way you
71:00 - could establish this
71:02 - is we could say well you know if i let f
71:05 - of x
71:07 - equal 1 plus 1 over
71:10 - n or i guess it should be x now sorry
71:14 - all right so so our sequence
71:18 - is just the values of f of x when we
71:22 - when we restrict the domain to the to
71:24 - the natural numbers but
71:26 - we know that the derivative of this
71:28 - thing
71:30 - is minus one over x squared which is
71:33 - less than zero
71:36 - if x is bigger than 1
71:39 - bigger than or equal to 1 and it's less
71:42 - than 0 for every x but in particular for
71:44 - x less than or equal to 1.
71:46 - and so that certainly establishes that
71:48 - this is a decreasing sequence
71:50 - the other the other way you can do it is
71:54 - you can consider
71:59 - the difference a n plus 1
72:02 - minus a n okay if our sequence is
72:05 - decreasing
72:07 - then this term should be smaller than
72:08 - that term so this
72:10 - difference should be negative so we can
72:11 - try to show that that difference is
72:13 - negative
72:16 - you can go ahead and try it but we'll do
72:17 - it in the next one right it is done in
72:19 - the book if you want to look in the book
72:20 - you can
72:21 - go through how to how to do it that way
72:23 - we'll apply in the next one because
72:25 - we've got four examples to get through
72:27 - and we don't want this video to get too
72:29 - long
72:30 - okay so how about the next one we could
72:33 - once again
72:35 - kind of use this function argument here
72:38 - but we could
72:40 - just go ahead and do it right so this
72:41 - time there's not a nice simplification
72:43 - but we can say well what do we get
72:44 - if we do b n plus 1
72:49 - minus bn okay what does that look like
72:53 - well we're going to have n
72:56 - plus 1 squared over
72:59 - n plus 2 subtract n
73:02 - squared over
73:06 - n plus one and we'd like to get a common
73:09 - denominator for that
73:11 - so we're going to get n plus one
73:15 - cubed minus n squared
73:18 - times n plus two over
73:21 - n plus one and plus two
73:26 - and well now we've got to multiply this
73:27 - all out
73:29 - n cubed plus three n squared plus three
73:33 - n plus one using binomial theorem
73:36 - minus n cubed minus
73:40 - two n squared
73:43 - over n plus n plus 2.
73:47 - and so we take a look at this and we say
73:50 - all right
73:52 - that cancels with that 2n squared that
73:55 - cancels with 2 of those
73:56 - 3 leaves you with 1. and
74:00 - okay so we have
74:04 - n squared plus 3n plus 1
74:09 - n plus 1 n plus
74:12 - 2. that's positive
74:16 - okay because n is positive
74:19 - and so now we know that this particular
74:23 - sequence here
74:24 - is increasing
74:28 - right because the difference is positive
74:31 - good one decreasing one increasing we
74:34 - can go to the next one
74:37 - so the next one actually you know it's
74:39 - gonna bounce around on you initially you
74:41 - might find if you start plotting some of
74:43 - the values
74:44 - textbook does that for you right we can
74:46 - consider you know
74:48 - if n is equal to 0 what do we get right
74:50 - if we sort of start writing out the
74:51 - terms in the sequence when n is equal to
74:53 - 0
74:53 - we have minus 9 over
74:56 - over 26 when n is equal to 1 we have
75:00 - minus
75:02 - 8 over what are we going to get
75:05 - 17 right n is equal to
75:10 - 2 we have minus
75:14 - 5 over 2
75:18 - right n is equal to 0 we get 0 right
75:22 - and so on we can start plotting these
75:24 - and sort of play around and see where
75:26 - they go
75:27 - um and it's kind of hard to tell looking
75:30 - at those values to figure it out
75:32 - we can do this sort of difference method
75:34 - again the textbook does that for you
75:35 - it's
75:36 - it's a big mess though um
75:39 - you might want to sort of analyze the
75:43 - two polynomials in n that you see here
75:45 - see if you can get anything out of that
75:46 - you might want to for example
75:48 - well the top we can factor
75:52 - i don't know if that helps this at all
75:53 - but we can factor it
75:55 - the bottom let's see the bottom we could
75:58 - complete the square
76:01 - n minus five squared plus one
76:04 - well it's never zero that's good news
76:07 - you can play around with that you can
76:10 - you can do this difference but it's it's
76:11 - going to be
76:12 - it's going to be ugly um so
76:16 - maybe we do want to look at this one
76:18 - from the point of view of a function we
76:19 - say okay let's consider
76:21 - let's consider f of x to be
76:25 - x squared minus 9 for x squared minus 10
76:30 - x plus 26.
76:34 - what's the derivative f prime is going
76:36 - to be
76:38 - 2x times x squared minus 10x plus 26.
76:43 - good little quotient rule okay
76:46 - subtract x squared minus 9
76:50 - times 2x minus 10
76:54 - whole thing over x squared minus 10x
76:59 - plus 26 all squared okay let me
77:02 - clean that up give myself a bit more
77:04 - room
77:06 - f prime of x so i've got 2 x cubed
77:09 - minus 20 x squared
77:12 - plus 52
77:16 - x minus 2x
77:19 - cubed from here
77:22 - and then i've got uh minus 10x squared
77:26 - minus plus 10x squared um minus 18x plus
77:31 - becomes plus 18x um
77:35 - and then minus 90. well that's a mess
77:40 - but you know what it's it's actually
77:41 - okay it's not
77:45 - it's not as bad of a mess as you might
77:47 - think
77:48 - we look for cancellations again
77:52 - cancel there we can cancel there um
77:59 - this was 10 that adds up so we get
78:03 - and then that's going to be 70 right so
78:05 - we get
78:06 - on top now the bottom is never zero
78:09 - right we established that up here
78:11 - the numerator is always positive and
78:13 - we're squaring it yeah so i mean
78:15 - we just got to focus on the numerator um
78:18 - so that numerator we've got minus
78:20 - 10x squared
78:23 - plus 70x
78:26 - okay minus
78:30 - 90. okay
78:34 - so
78:37 - this is a quadratic and it's opening
78:39 - downwards right we can in fact we can
78:41 - pull out the minus 10.
78:45 - so we have x squared
78:48 - minus 7x plus 9.
78:53 - okay and it doesn't factor
78:57 - super nice but
79:00 - we can definitely tell that it's a
79:02 - quadratic it's opening downwards
79:04 - so these terms are initially increasing
79:06 - right they're initially increasing
79:08 - towards sort of that vertex in this
79:11 - quadratic on you know
79:12 - so there's a few values of of n at the
79:14 - beginning where we're on this side of
79:16 - the quadratic and things are increasing
79:18 - once we hit that maximum it's going to
79:20 - be decreasing right
79:23 - so we expect that this is an eventually
79:25 - decreasing sequence
79:27 - it's not decreasing from the beginning
79:29 - it's increasing a bit at the start
79:31 - but it's eventually going to start
79:33 - decreasing
79:35 - which is good enough okay we're getting
79:38 - a little long here there's one more
79:39 - still to go
79:40 - what can we say with this last one
79:43 - the factorial we can't really model with
79:45 - functions anymore we could
79:46 - try looking at the difference this might
79:49 - be one where it makes sense to just
79:50 - start writing out terms and
79:52 - initially initially it seems like it's
79:54 - increasing right
79:56 - so we have one for n equals one
79:59 - and then we're going to have four over
80:01 - two so we have two
80:02 - and then we have 9 over 6
80:07 - oh that's already actually a little bit
80:08 - smaller right 16
80:12 - 16 over 24 right
80:15 - and then we have 25 over
80:20 - 120 and so on
80:24 - this is definitely decreasing right the
80:26 - factorial is going to grow much
80:28 - faster than the power function is
80:33 - so you have a decreasing sequence if you
80:35 - wanted to really kind of
80:36 - nail it down you could kind of look at
80:38 - this sort of difference again you could
80:40 - say okay
80:41 - what does the difference look like n
80:43 - plus 1
80:45 - minus dn so you have n plus 1
80:50 - squared over n plus 1 factorial
80:54 - minus n squared
80:58 - over n factorial
81:01 - actually if you remember that
81:05 - n plus 1 factorial
81:08 - is n plus 1 times n factorial right it's
81:11 - defined recursively
81:14 - then what you have here is just
81:17 - n plus 1 over n factorial minus n
81:21 - squared over n
81:21 - factorial
81:25 - okay and so it's minus n squared
81:30 - plus n plus 1 over over n factorial
81:35 - that is definitely going to be negative
81:37 - for large values of n
81:38 - right so once we pass here
81:42 - it's definitely negative we have a
81:43 - decreasing sequence
81:50 - all right so we're pretty much done with
81:51 - sequences now i'm ready to move on to
81:54 - series before we do
81:55 - i want to show you one more let's say
81:57 - slightly more challenging example
81:59 - this one has a sequence which is defined
82:01 - recursively right so we don't have a
82:03 - formula like most of the ones we've been
82:05 - dealing with so far we just have some
82:06 - formula that says a n is this function
82:08 - of n
82:09 - right and a lot of the time we can fall
82:12 - back on
82:12 - calculus techniques that we already have
82:14 - to understand what's going on
82:16 - but this one is defined recursively so
82:18 - we don't we don't have a function that
82:19 - we
82:20 - can work with so how do we find the
82:22 - limit of such a thing right
82:24 - i mean you can start thinking about like
82:25 - what do the what do the terms look like
82:27 - you know
82:28 - a1 is is root two
82:32 - a2 is root two plus root
82:36 - two a3 is
82:39 - root 2 plus root 2 plus root
82:42 - 2 and so on
82:46 - is that even going anywhere if so where
82:49 - right
82:49 - it's not at all clear how do we figure
82:52 - this out
82:53 - well we know
82:56 - that
83:02 - bounded monotone sequences
83:11 - converge okay so one of the things that
83:14 - we can do
83:15 - is we start plugging values in you know
83:19 - put them in the calculator you see what
83:20 - you get you get some numbers out right
83:22 - by the time you get to like a4 it's
83:23 - starting getting complicated enough that
83:25 - maybe you don't want to put it into the
83:26 - calculator anymore
83:28 - but you can try a few and if you try a
83:30 - few you find that you're getting numbers
83:33 - that are one
83:34 - point something you know they seem to be
83:36 - hovering a little bit below two
83:39 - so you might guess that
83:42 - two is an upper bound so that would be
83:44 - the first claim
83:49 - so we're going to claim that a
83:52 - n is less than or equal to 2
83:58 - for all values of n
84:02 - well how do you show that how do you
84:04 - show that a n is going to be less than
84:06 - or equal to 2
84:07 - for all values of n
84:11 - it's a little tricky right how do you
84:12 - deal with this recursively defined thing
84:15 - you could look at the difference you
84:16 - know 2 minus a n
84:18 - can we do anything with that let's see i
84:20 - mean
84:23 - 2 minus a n
84:26 - is what can i even say about a n um i
84:29 - don't know i can say it's like
84:32 - well i'm sorry 2 should go on the inside
84:37 - right you know put the square root of a
84:38 - n minus 1.
84:40 - um does that get me anywhere i want to
84:43 - show that this
84:44 - is positive right i want to show this is
84:47 - less than 2.
84:48 - so i want to show that that 2 minus a n
84:50 - is bigger than 0.
84:52 - not at all clear i could try
84:54 - rationalizing does rationalize get me
84:56 - anywhere
84:57 - um
85:01 - we are going to go somewhere don't worry
85:02 - all right
85:04 - we get 2 minus there
85:08 - and then we get you know 2
85:12 - plus that square root on the bottom
85:16 - and okay you can simplify those cancel
85:21 - that's a plus um
85:25 - but you still feel like maybe you're
85:26 - stalled so
85:29 - how do you proceed well
85:33 - the right way to do this is you proceed
85:38 - using a technique called induction so
85:40 - we're going to proceed
85:41 - by
85:45 - induction okay so induction
85:50 - on and so the way this looks is
85:55 - we say okay so first of all
86:04 - we know that a1
86:08 - is less than 2 right because a1 is
86:12 - square root of 2 we know that the square
86:13 - root of 2 is less than 2.
86:15 - okay
86:18 - 2. we're going to suppose
86:24 - suppose we know that
86:29 - some a k is less than or equal to 2.
86:36 - right actually we do we know when k
86:39 - is equal to one right and so what we're
86:42 - gonna do is we're gonna imagine well
86:43 - maybe maybe we also know this for some
86:44 - other values of k
86:46 - two three four we don't yet but suppose
86:48 - we did
86:54 - so the next step is we say
86:58 - well if we know that can we show
87:01 - that a k plus 1. is less than or equal
87:04 - to 2.
87:06 - this is this is how an induction
87:08 - argument works now we're going to do it
87:09 - before we do it
87:10 - let's point out why it works why does
87:12 - this work well
87:14 - essentially what you're showing here is
87:17 - you're showing this implication right
87:18 - you're showing that if this is less than
87:19 - or equal to 2
87:21 - then the next one will be less than or
87:23 - equal to 2 so we have this implication
87:24 - going like that
87:26 - we know a1 is less than or equal to 2.
87:28 - so this is true when k is equal to 1.
87:30 - but if the hypothesis of a conditional
87:32 - is true so is the conclusion
87:34 - so we know that a one is less than or
87:36 - equal to two therefore a two
87:37 - is less than or equal to two but now we
87:40 - come back
87:41 - right a two is less than or equal to two
87:43 - therefore a3 is less than or equal to 2.
87:45 - since a3 is less than equal to 2 a4 is
87:47 - less than or equal to 2
87:49 - and so on so we just kind of get into
87:51 - this this loop and we generate
87:53 - all the other possibilities so it
87:55 - remains to show
87:56 - that if a k is less than or equal to 2
87:58 - then
87:59 - ak plus 1 should be less than or equal
88:01 - to 2. well why is that true
88:07 - if we assume a k is less than or equal
88:11 - to 2
88:12 - well then we get that ak plus 1 is
88:15 - well by definition it's 2 plus square
88:18 - root of 2 plus ak
88:20 - right oh but we've assumed that ak is
88:23 - less than or equal to 2
88:24 - so this must be less than or equal to
88:25 - the square root of 2 plus
88:27 - 2 right replace a k by something bigger
88:30 - but 2 plus 2 is 4
88:31 - square root of 4 is 2.
88:40 - okay and
88:44 - that means
88:48 - that a n is less than equal to 2 for
88:51 - all natural numbers n
88:56 - using this technique of induction
89:01 - very good okay
89:05 - so now we want to show that
89:08 - so we've shown it's bounded now we want
89:09 - to show that it's monotone
89:12 - okay
89:16 - so i'm going to claim that a n is less
89:20 - than or equal to a n plus 1
89:22 - for all and i want to show that it's
89:25 - increasing
89:26 - okay and
89:29 - so we could we could try something like
89:31 - this we could try playing around with
89:33 - differences and you know i think you can
89:36 - sort of get something to work
89:38 - doing it that way you can look at the
89:40 - difference you can
89:41 - put in the definition i mean let's let's
89:44 - check quickly and see what happens
89:45 - if i do the difference a n plus 1 minus
89:48 - a n
89:49 - well that's root 2 plus a n minus
89:53 - a n rationalize i get uh
89:56 - it's going to be 2 plus a n um
90:00 - oh well you know this isn't so great
90:01 - either right because if i rationalize i
90:04 - get
90:04 - 2 plus a n and i get minus a n
90:07 - squared over
90:11 - okay
90:15 - that doesn't seem ideal ok so we
90:19 - we scratch that so that doesn't seem to
90:22 - be working
90:23 - um let's try induction again can we do
90:27 - it by induction
90:28 - um if n is equal to one
90:33 - so we have chi we have a starting point
90:34 - right what's the base case
90:36 - so if n is equal to one is it true that
90:38 - a1 is less than or equal to a2
90:41 - well let's see we know what a1 is a2
90:46 - is the square root of two
90:49 - plus a one okay
90:55 - and let's see well we know that a1 is
90:58 - certainly bigger than zero right so this
91:00 - is
91:00 - bigger than simply root two
91:06 - and root two is a one
91:09 - okay got that um
91:13 - so now if we suppose
91:18 - assume that a
91:22 - k is less than or equal to a k plus 1
91:26 - for some k well
91:29 - then what would be the next step so the
91:33 - next step if we just if we would assume
91:35 - this
91:36 - here right we increment by one right
91:39 - going from two to three we increment by
91:40 - one
91:41 - so we want to show the next time we be
91:43 - sure that a k plus 2
91:44 - is bigger than or equal to a k plus 1.
91:46 - so we say okay
91:48 - a k plus 2 by definition it's
91:51 - 2 plus a k plus 1.
91:55 - oh but we've assumed that ak plus 1 is
91:57 - bigger than or equal to a k
92:01 - ah but root of two plus a k
92:07 - that's a k plus one done
92:11 - okay so using this technique of
92:13 - induction we can show that it's
92:16 - bounded above by two we can show that
92:19 - it's
92:19 - increasing okay so it's increasing it's
92:22 - bounded above
92:23 - it has to have a limit we have a theorem
92:25 - that says the limit is guaranteed
92:27 - okay so how do we find that limit now
92:30 - that we know it exists
92:32 - well here's a here's a sneaky trick we
92:34 - have this equality right
92:36 - let's take the limit of both sides
92:40 - limit as n goes to infinity for a n
92:43 - plus 1 should be equal to the limit
92:48 - well i get a little bit ahead of myself
92:50 - but let me let's do it i've already
92:51 - wrote the square root
92:54 - you can bring the limit inside the
92:55 - square root because square root function
92:57 - is continuous
92:59 - okay and the kicker here
93:02 - is that this limit okay that's l right l
93:05 - is the limit is equal to infinity of a
93:06 - n but i mean that's going to be the same
93:08 - limit here right because here you're
93:09 - just
93:10 - incrementing by 1 you get to the same
93:12 - place if n is going to infinity so is n
93:14 - plus 1.
93:15 - so l is equal to the square root of 2
93:18 - plus
93:20 - l got to solve for l square both sides
93:25 - l squared is 2 plus l
93:28 - so l squared minus l minus 2
93:32 - is 0. so let's see l minus two
93:37 - l plus one two possibilities for the
93:41 - limit well it's certainly not minus one
93:43 - because all of the terms are positive
93:46 - so
93:49 - looks like the limit should be 2.
93:57 - all right so we're going to move on now
93:59 - from sequences
94:00 - to series now
94:04 - in a sense a sequel a series is just a
94:06 - special type of sequence
94:08 - um it's a new sequence that's built from
94:09 - an old sequence um
94:11 - maybe more or more correctly a series is
94:13 - the limit of this new sequence um let me
94:15 - explain
94:16 - so start with some sequence
94:23 - okay so we have a sequence let's say
94:26 - a1 a2
94:29 - a3 a4
94:32 - a5 and so on i'm going to write out the
94:35 - terms
94:36 - okay so as an example
94:41 - we could do the sequence one
94:45 - one half one quarter right
94:48 - so in general this is
94:54 - just a geometric sequence right with
94:56 - ratio one half
94:57 - one over powers of two and
95:01 - now what we're going to do is we're
95:02 - going to form the so-called partial sums
95:10 - okay so
95:14 - s1 is just a1
95:18 - s2 the sum of the first two
95:22 - terms in the sequence okay
95:27 - s3 will be a1 plus a2
95:31 - plus a3 s4
95:35 - will be a1 plus a2 plus a3
95:39 - plus a4 and so on right
95:44 - so in general we could say sn
95:50 - would be the sum k going from 1 to n
95:55 - of ak okay sum of the first n terms
96:01 - so this gives me a new sequence right
96:03 - this is
96:11 - is a
96:15 - sequence okay and if you have a sequence
96:18 - then it's reasonable to ask
96:22 - does it converge
96:26 - and well what what would be the limit of
96:30 - that sequence right
96:31 - what should it mean to say okay well
96:35 - what would it converge to what would be
96:36 - that limit if that limit exists
96:39 - what does it look like it's the limit n
96:42 - going to infinity of this s n
96:46 - well maybe we write that as the limit
96:50 - and going to infinity of this sum
96:53 - k going from 1 to n of
96:58 - a k and
97:01 - it's sort of notationally convenient to
97:03 - say well really what we mean then
97:04 - is something like this it's the sum
97:08 - k going from 1 to infinity
97:12 - of a sub k right we just keep adding the
97:15 - terms forever
97:18 - okay so this notation that you see here
97:22 - this is what we would call
97:26 - a series okay so a series
97:29 - is the sum of a sequence okay
97:32 - now for a lot of sequences that even
97:35 - sequences that converge
97:37 - a series is not necessarily going to
97:39 - converge right
97:40 - in particular we can see right away that
97:42 - um
97:44 - if the terms in the sequence are
97:47 - not shrinking and it's not shrinking
97:49 - fast enough right
97:50 - for example if if all the values in this
97:52 - sequence are staying close to some value
97:54 - like say two
97:55 - right then this is like two two plus two
97:58 - two plus two plus two two plus two plus
98:00 - two plus two
98:01 - right if you're if you keep adding more
98:03 - and more terms and those terms are
98:04 - always close to 2
98:06 - well then this sum is going to explode
98:09 - on you right the sum gets bigger and
98:10 - bigger and bigger it doesn't have a
98:11 - limit
98:13 - so it may not converge right so
98:16 - when we're studying sequences we can use
98:19 - a lot of sort of calculus techniques we
98:21 - can play around we can often
98:23 - you know use analytic arguments to say
98:25 - oh yes this
98:26 - sequence converges and it converges to a
98:28 - particular limit here we just calculated
98:30 - it
98:32 - series is a very sort of different
98:34 - approach the flavor is much different
98:36 - the feeling is different because when
98:37 - you're dealing with series
98:39 - it's rare that you can actually say what
98:41 - a series converges to
98:42 - this happens to be one where we can so
98:45 - maybe it's a bad example but a lot of
98:46 - the time
98:48 - you're trying to show that a series
98:50 - converges you want to show that
98:52 - this sum right the limit of this sum is
98:54 - finite that you actually get a value out
98:56 - you may never be able to calculate it it
98:59 - might be that all you can do is say that
99:01 - the limit exists
99:02 - it has a value we don't know what it is
99:04 - but it exists
99:05 - right that can be frustrating for some
99:08 - people it's a
99:09 - change in process from a lot of what
99:11 - you've done the only thing you've seen
99:13 - so far that's similar to it is probably
99:15 - when you're doing like comparison tests
99:16 - for improper integrals
99:19 - so it's a bit of an adjustment but
99:20 - hopefully it's one that you're able to
99:22 - make
99:23 - coming back to this one here let's see
99:26 - what those partial sums look like
99:28 - why not s1
99:32 - is one as two
99:35 - is one plus a half
99:39 - which is three halves that's three
99:43 - one plus a half
99:46 - plus a quarter um so let's see
99:51 - that is four quarters plus two quarters
99:54 - plus one quarter
99:57 - seven quarters right that's four
100:01 - one plus a half plus a quarter
100:05 - plus an eighth one plus two plus four
100:09 - plus
100:10 - eight i get
100:13 - 15 over eight
100:16 - okay
100:19 - s5 one plus a half
100:23 - plus a quarter plus an eighth
100:27 - plus one over 16. and if you add that
100:30 - all up you find that you get 31
100:32 - over over 16. right
100:37 - you get
100:41 - 2 minus 1 2 minus a half
100:46 - 2 minus a quarter two minus an eighth
100:51 - two minus the sixteenth and and so on
100:55 - and so you might guess that this pattern
100:58 - continues of course you should actually
100:59 - show it and there are ways to show it
101:01 - and we'll do that later on
101:04 - but each of these partial sums these are
101:07 - called partial sums right
101:09 - is 2 minus a number and the number that
101:11 - we're subtracting gets smaller and
101:12 - smaller as we go through the partial
101:14 - sums which
101:15 - makes you think that hey maybe just
101:18 - maybe this adds up to something right
101:22 - and actually you can sort of see it
101:25 - visually right if you think about
101:30 - taking the number line
101:33 - from zero to two there's one in the
101:36 - middle
101:37 - and you start filling it up right um
101:40 - well the first and so you always fill
101:42 - half of what there is to fill right
101:45 - so in the first step we add one
101:49 - right in the second step
101:53 - we add a half in the third step
101:56 - we add a quarter that's half of what's
101:58 - left over
101:59 - in the fourth step we had an eighth
102:02 - then we had a sixteenth right so you get
102:05 - this sort of like xenos
102:07 - paradox style thing going on at each
102:10 - step
102:10 - you you know you cover half the distance
102:13 - that's the remaining
102:15 - right so you go half the distance
102:16 - remaining so there's always a little bit
102:18 - remaining because you only cover half
102:19 - the remaining distance
102:20 - right but each time you recover half the
102:23 - meaning
102:24 - every time you cover half the remaining
102:25 - distance you get a little bit closer and
102:27 - closer and closer
102:28 - to two until the distance that's left is
102:30 - so small
102:31 - um that you know it's less than let's
102:33 - say epsilon for example if you're
102:34 - thinking about doing epsilon
102:36 - and definition for a limit um and so
102:38 - indeed you can show that the limit
102:41 - actually converges converges to 2 and
102:44 - the sum
102:46 - k going from 1 to infinity
102:50 - actually we started at 0 right 1 is
102:53 - 1 over 2 to the 0 one over two to the k
102:58 - comes out to be two pretty cool
103:06 - all right so in the last video we we
103:08 - introduced the idea of a
103:10 - series as this limit of a sequence of
103:13 - partial sums for some pre-existing
103:16 - sequence right
103:17 - so if that limit exists we say that the
103:19 - sequence convert or the series converges
103:22 - if it doesn't exist we say the series
103:23 - diverges
103:26 - so here are two series that we want to
103:28 - show diverge
103:29 - so how do we do it well um we can start
103:32 - thinking about what what are the partial
103:33 - sums look like right
103:34 - so in this case here we have
103:39 - s1 you can even start at 0 right s0
103:43 - is 0 squared 0
103:47 - s1 is 0
103:50 - squared plus 1 squared which is 1
103:55 - as 2 is 0 squared plus 1 squared
104:00 - plus 2 squared is 5
104:04 - that's 3 0 squared 1 squared
104:08 - oops 2 squared
104:12 - 3 squared is 14
104:16 - and so on and it certainly seems like
104:18 - those partial sums are going to keep
104:20 - growing and growing and growing
104:23 - well in general we know that
104:27 - s k is the sum
104:31 - you know let's say uh
104:34 - n going from 1 to k
104:38 - might as well start at 1 right starting
104:39 - at 0 we're adding 0 we don't gain
104:41 - anything from that
104:42 - n going from 1 to k of of n squared
104:46 - oh we've seen that before way back when
104:50 - we were doing like riemann sums right we
104:52 - saw this summation formula
104:53 - maybe we did it with i instead we get
104:56 - something like
104:56 - k k plus 1
105:00 - 2 k plus 1 over 6.
105:04 - and so certainly we can see from this
105:07 - that if we take the limit
105:10 - as k goes to infinity
105:14 - of of sk well that limit is going to be
105:18 - infinite right
105:19 - um this thing grows more or less as k
105:21 - cubed
105:22 - okay so certainly the limit uh doesn't
105:25 - exist
105:26 - so the series diverges all right
105:30 - how about this one here well
105:33 - let's start writing out you know what
105:35 - what is what does the
105:37 - sequence look like right so bn
105:41 - looks like well if n is equal to one
105:44 - this is minus one squared so
105:46 - one and it's gonna be minus one one
105:49 - minus one
105:50 - one minus one one
105:53 - right forever okay so
105:57 - from there well what does sn look like
106:00 - well we just do one and then one minus
106:03 - one
106:04 - we get to zero one minus one plus one
106:08 - one one minus one plus one minus one
106:11 - zero and i think by now you can probably
106:15 - guess the pattern we get something that
106:18 - looks like that
106:20 - okay so no fancy formula this time we
106:23 - just look at this and say well look
106:25 - we have a sequence which just alternates
106:26 - between zero and one
106:28 - we want the limit of that sequence well
106:30 - that limit certainly does not exist
106:32 - right
106:35 - the limit as n goes to infinity of s n
106:38 - does not exist
106:43 - so the series diverges
106:49 - so the next example we want to look at
106:53 - or a topic if you like is geometric
106:56 - series so the geometric series is a
106:58 - special type of series
107:01 - where we actually can understand pretty
107:02 - much everything there is to know about
107:04 - the geometric series
107:06 - it's also an important series because it
107:08 - comes up quite a bit
107:09 - when once we move on right later on
107:11 - we're going to look at power series
107:12 - taylor series right we're going to have
107:14 - so power series is sort of a natural
107:16 - extension you know from polynomials
107:19 - to things where you know we're still
107:20 - working in powers of x but we don't have
107:22 - a highest power of x right we just keep
107:24 - going on forever adding more and more
107:25 - terms
107:26 - in which case well you know you're going
107:28 - to have like an x to the n
107:29 - in there and you want to understand
107:31 - what's going on right you want you're
107:32 - going to
107:33 - be seeing series that look like that
107:35 - okay
107:36 - some people will put a constant in there
107:38 - like an a
107:40 - a times r to the n and call that a
107:41 - geometric series but you can always
107:43 - factor out the constant bring it out
107:45 - front
107:46 - even for an infinite series that works
107:48 - so we'll just concentrate
107:50 - on this and if we want to put a constant
107:51 - in we can always multiply by a constant
107:54 - all right so what can we say
107:57 - about a geometric series well one notice
108:00 - that notice that we start at zero
108:04 - not at one okay so if we were
108:08 - writing out the terms in the sequence
108:10 - that we're using here right the terms in
108:12 - the sequence are
108:13 - one r r squared
108:16 - r cubed and so on we add we add by r
108:20 - every time so we can think of those as
108:21 - maybe like the a
108:22 - n's and then the sn right
108:26 - the partial sums that we're adding up
108:28 - those are going to be 1
108:31 - 1 plus r 1 plus r
108:34 - plus r squared 1 plus
108:37 - r plus r squared plus r
108:40 - cubed and so on okay
108:44 - now uh what's cool is we can actually
108:47 - come up with a nice closed form formula
108:51 - for those partial sums okay so
108:54 - we have the following so if we look at
108:56 - sn so sn
108:59 - would be 1 plus r
109:03 - plus r squared okay
109:06 - up to r to the n
109:09 - right now
109:13 - i'm going to do this i'm going to do r
109:16 - times s n multiply everything by r so
109:19 - then i have
109:20 - r plus r squared
109:23 - and r cubed and so on up to r
109:26 - to the n and then n
109:30 - plus 1. now i've shifted it over one
109:32 - because
109:33 - what i want to do is i want to subtract
109:36 - these
109:39 - subtract so on this side if i subtract
109:42 - i'm going to have 1 minus
109:46 - r times sn right
109:49 - 1sn minus rsn gives me 1 over r if i
109:51 - factor out the sn
109:53 - and on the other side i have
109:57 - 1 r minus r r squared minus r squared rn
110:01 - right all of these terms cancel we're
110:03 - just left with that last one
110:06 - r to the n plus 1. okay
110:11 - so that means that my partial sums
110:16 - look like this 1 minus r to the n plus 1
110:21 - divided by 1 minus
110:25 - r okay
110:28 - and notice that the dependence on n
110:31 - is entirely here in this exponent
110:36 - okay
110:39 - so now we ask ourself well what happens
110:42 - what happens if you take the limit
110:48 - as n goes to infinity of
110:52 - r r to the n or n plus one if you like
110:56 - okay well
111:00 - there are three possibilities um
111:03 - and i guess you know just to keep things
111:05 - uh
111:07 - let's keep things simple for now um
111:11 - no we'll just say let r be a real number
111:13 - um
111:14 - if the
111:18 - absolute value of r
111:21 - is less than one okay
111:26 - then this limit will be
111:29 - zero
111:32 - okay because if you take a number that's
111:35 - less than one an absolute value when you
111:36 - raise it to a higher power
111:38 - gets larger and larger and larger
111:41 - and you get zero in the limit okay
111:45 - it's equal to one if r
111:48 - is equal to 1.
111:52 - it's undefined
111:58 - if r is equal to -1 because it's just
112:00 - going to flop back and forth between 1
112:01 - minus 1.
112:04 - and it's going to be infinite if the
112:07 - absolute value of r
112:08 - is bigger than 1. okay
112:14 - all right so these these are not too
112:16 - hard to work out you can convince
112:18 - yourself that these are true
112:19 - and so then we look at this and we say
112:22 - okay well what can we
112:23 - say then about this sequence of partial
112:25 - sums well
112:26 - um minus one we actually saw that
112:30 - in the last video right we saw an
112:32 - example
112:33 - minus one to the n that series diverges
112:36 - right we don't get anything there so
112:37 - that one diverges
112:38 - uh one to the n also diverges right
112:42 - because
112:44 - the one i guess case that we left out
112:47 - here
112:48 - is this is all well and good
112:51 - if r is not equal to one right but
112:56 - if r is equal to 1 then
112:59 - sn is just n right because you're just
113:02 - going to be doing
113:03 - 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 right
113:10 - so you get n and limit of n is n goes to
113:12 - infinity is certainly infinite
113:14 - okay and so we look at this and we say
113:17 - well you know what
113:18 - the the only time where you can actually
113:20 - take a limit of this
113:22 - is going to be if absolute value of r
113:25 - is less than one so what we can say
113:29 - is that this
113:32 - geometric series n going from zero to
113:36 - infinity
113:37 - r to the n
113:41 - it converges if the absolute value of r
113:46 - is less than one
113:49 - and in that case
113:57 - we get an answer 1 over 1
114:00 - minus r for that sum right
114:03 - because this part is going to go to zero
114:06 - okay
114:09 - and it diverges otherwise
114:17 - so this is an interesting example
114:18 - because not only can we say exactly when
114:20 - it converges we can say what it
114:22 - converges to
114:23 - that's not always going to be the case
114:30 - all right here are three quick examples
114:33 - three quarters to the n minus one to the
114:35 - n over two to the n
114:36 - three to the n we wanna identify these
114:39 - as geometric series
114:41 - decide if they converge if they do
114:42 - converge figure out what the value is
114:45 - okay so in this case here
114:49 - it fits fits the pattern right we say
114:51 - okay what is the value of r
114:52 - r is three quarters
114:56 - and three quarters is definitely less
114:59 - than one
115:00 - an absolute value so we know that it
115:03 - converges
115:05 - and we know what it converges to all
115:07 - right
115:08 - the sum and going from zero to infinity
115:14 - maybe i'll point that out it converges
115:16 - and so let's figure that out
115:18 - so 3 over 4 to the n
115:23 - okay it's going to converge to 1 over
115:27 - 1 minus r r is
115:30 - 3 quarters so one over a quarter
115:35 - if we simplify we get four
115:39 - okay moving on to the next one
115:42 - well one of the things that you need to
115:45 - realize here
115:46 - is that i can always rewrite that
115:49 - as minus 1
115:53 - half to the n right same as this one
115:55 - here we could have equally well being
115:57 - given this one as
115:58 - 3 to the n divided by 4 to the n so you
116:00 - got to be able to
116:01 - you know do those basic laws of
116:03 - exponents manipulations to get things
116:05 - into the right form
116:07 - all right it's in the right form so
116:09 - what's r
116:12 - r is minus one-half and we know that
116:18 - the absolute value of minus one-half
116:21 - is one-half which is less than one
116:24 - so again we have a convergent series and
116:29 - what is the sum n going from zero to
116:31 - infinity
116:32 - of minus one half to the
116:36 - n it's going to be one over one minus
116:39 - minus one half okay so one plus half so
116:43 - one over three halves
116:47 - take the reciprocal we get two thirds
116:50 - okay this last one here
116:53 - well r is equal to three that's bigger
116:57 - than one
116:58 - so that diverges
117:05 - so the next type of series we want to
117:06 - look at is a p series
117:09 - okay so the basic form of a p series
117:11 - looks like this it's just one over some
117:14 - power of n right p is the power here p
117:17 - and p
117:17 - series is the power of n that we see in
117:19 - the denominator
117:21 - we can consider a basic p series where
117:23 - we simply have a power of
117:24 - n we might see something more general
117:27 - like this where we have some
117:28 - coefficients in there
117:30 - the only thing you've got to be careful
117:32 - about here
117:34 - is the starting point i've written n
117:36 - equals 1 but
117:37 - we'd have to check to make sure you know
117:39 - so a a and b
117:40 - here i mean they they could be any real
117:43 - numbers
117:44 - but we'd have to check to see when
117:47 - when does a n plus b when is that equal
117:49 - to zero right we want to watch out for
117:51 - that
117:52 - make sure it's not equal to zero if
117:54 - there is a zero for this
117:56 - at a positive value for n right if
117:58 - there's a if there's an integer value of
118:00 - n that gives me a zero
118:02 - i better start my series after that
118:05 - or it's not going to be defined right so
118:07 - we won't even get to talk about
118:08 - convergence because there's going to be
118:10 - one term in the series that blows up
118:13 - all right so the main result about p
118:16 - series is the following theorem
118:22 - which states that
118:25 - a p p series
118:32 - converges
118:37 - if p is strictly greater than one
118:42 - and it diverges otherwise so it diverges
118:48 - for p
118:50 - less than or equal to one okay so that's
118:52 - simple enough
118:53 - now this p-series test
118:57 - tells us whether or not the series
118:58 - converges it doesn't say anything about
119:00 - what that series converges
119:02 - to right so this is strictly a test for
119:04 - convergence
119:05 - we are not trying to calculate a value
119:07 - for the series
119:09 - should remind you a little bit about the
119:11 - p-series test for improper integrals and
119:13 - in fact that's where
119:14 - we get this from we'll see in the next
119:17 - section that
119:18 - we can use the result that we have for
119:20 - improper integrals
119:22 - to establish this result for p series so
119:25 - the
119:25 - proof of this result is going to have to
119:27 - wait but in the meantime we can put it
119:29 - to use
119:30 - here are several series we can see do
119:32 - they converge or diverge
119:34 - this one here this is actually an
119:37 - important result this
119:38 - is the so-called harmonic series
119:42 - okay
119:47 - and in this case
119:50 - p is equal to one but it's not bigger
119:53 - than one
119:54 - so this
119:58 - diverges okay so the harmonic series is
120:01 - a is sort of a
120:02 - famous counter example right
120:06 - um the first thing that you might kind
120:07 - of think when you start working with
120:09 - series
120:09 - you know you're adding infinitely many
120:10 - terms so you might think that as long as
120:13 - the terms go to zero you should be able
120:14 - to add them all up
120:16 - but the harmonic series is is this
120:19 - classic example that shows it's not
120:21 - enough to have the terms
120:22 - in your series go to zero that's not
120:24 - enough for you to have a sum
120:26 - you actually need those terms to
120:29 - go to zero fast enough or the thing is
120:32 - not going to converge right
120:34 - and so we can think of this as a
120:37 - consequence of the p
120:38 - series test that this series diverges
120:41 - although there are other ways that you
120:42 - can do this
120:44 - you can prove divergence sort of
120:45 - directly
120:47 - the the classic way that you do this is
120:50 - you say okay well
120:51 - my my sequence looks like one plus a
120:54 - half
120:56 - [Music]
120:57 - plus a third plus a quarter
121:02 - plus a fifth and so on
121:05 - and you start sort of grouping things
121:08 - together
121:09 - and you say okay well you know
121:13 - these two terms they add up to something
121:16 - that's that's bigger
121:17 - than a half and then actually if i added
121:19 - the next sort of three terms
121:22 - a fifth plus a sixth plus a plus a
121:25 - seventh
121:27 - those are going to add up to something
121:29 - that's bigger than a half
121:31 - and so on i think this is the this is
121:33 - the strategy that we use
121:35 - and and so by sort of grouping things
121:37 - appropriately we can say well the whole
121:39 - thing is is bigger than one
121:41 - you know plus a half plus a half plus a
121:44 - half
121:45 - and that's going to go to infinity if
121:48 - you keep adding one half forever
121:50 - interesting this next one
121:54 - well this is p series with p equal to
121:56 - two so this converges right
121:58 - here p is equal to two so this one
122:02 - converges this one is another famous
122:06 - series because we actually can say what
122:10 - the sum is
122:11 - and the sum is sort of surprising
122:14 - hope i remember this correctly the
122:16 - result is something like pi squared
122:19 - over 6 and you might be surprised to see
122:21 - pi making an appearance there
122:23 - and there are a number of ways that you
122:25 - can derive this result different areas
122:27 - of mathematics it pops up
122:31 - you can show it using surprisingly
122:32 - enough complex numbers complex analysis
122:35 - there's one way to show it there's other
122:36 - ways coming from differential equations
122:38 - there's also
122:39 - it's a strange result it pops up in a
122:40 - number of places there there are
122:42 - three or four very different proofs of
122:44 - the result
122:46 - the original result i think goes all the
122:47 - way back to euler
122:50 - and so that's interesting maybe more
122:52 - interesting
122:54 - as far as i know if we go to 1 over n
122:57 - cubed nobody actually knows what that
122:59 - adds up to we know it converges right
123:01 - it's p series with p equal to three p is
123:03 - bigger than one it converges
123:04 - nobody knows what it converges to odd
123:09 - how about this one uh okay this is well
123:12 - root n is one half so it is a p series
123:15 - but p
123:15 - is equal to one half and one half is
123:18 - smaller than one right two is bigger
123:19 - than one we should have pointed that out
123:21 - um and so that means that this one
123:23 - diverges
123:25 - okay
123:28 - this one here
123:32 - is not a p series
123:36 - we actually can't comment on the
123:38 - convergence of this one yet
123:41 - when you have this minus 1 to the n this
123:43 - alternating sign right so the
123:45 - the terms in this series are going to
123:46 - alternate between positive negative
123:48 - positive negative positive negative as
123:49 - you add them up
123:51 - those series have a special name they're
123:52 - called alternating series
123:54 - and there are special techniques for
123:55 - dealing with them
123:58 - it turns out that this alternating
124:00 - series does
124:01 - actually converge so adding that
124:03 - alternating sign is enough to take this
124:05 - divergent
124:06 - harmonic series and give you a
124:08 - convergent alternating
124:10 - series it does converge um and actually
124:12 - interestingly enough
124:14 - we know what this converges to as well
124:16 - converges to the natural log of two
124:19 - that's weird right actually we're going
124:21 - to see once we get to talking about
124:22 - taylor series we'll see where that comes
124:24 - from
124:25 - okay so it's not a p series
124:28 - but we'll see later on how to show that
124:30 - one converges
124:32 - this one here well this is a p series
124:34 - right
124:36 - it's a sort of this general form of the
124:38 - p series
124:40 - with p equal to three which is bigger
124:42 - than one
124:43 - and so that means that this one
124:45 - converges
124:48 - um notice the starting value 11 right
124:52 - we can't we can't do 10 because
124:55 - we get a zero in the denominator so we
124:57 - got to make sure
124:59 - that we watch out for things like zeros
125:00 - in the denominators start the sum a
125:02 - little bit later on
125:03 - once you're past all the zeros and then
125:05 - you can talk about convergence
125:07 - last one well the last one is not a p
125:09 - series the last one is geometric series
125:11 - fortunately we've already done that
125:13 - right this is geometric it's not a p
125:15 - series but it's geometric
125:22 - with r equal to one half and of course
125:25 - one half is less than one in absolute
125:27 - value
125:27 - so we know that this converges and
125:30 - actually we we know what it converges to
125:31 - we saw this in the introduction
125:33 - video converges to two
125:42 - so the next few examples we're going to
125:44 - look at deal with what are called
125:46 - telescoping series
125:48 - so a telescoping series is one where as
125:51 - we write out the partial sums
125:53 - we find that there's a lot of
125:54 - cancellation so there's a lot of
125:55 - cancellation within the sums
125:57 - and that allows us to
126:00 - evaluate the the series right now this
126:03 - one here
126:04 - we can actually we could show that this
126:07 - converges using essentially p series um
126:10 - or comparison we haven't established
126:12 - comparison tests yet
126:13 - but if you really wanted to you could do
126:15 - something like this right you could
126:16 - write this as the sum
126:19 - n equals sorry 1 get it over common
126:22 - denominator
126:24 - and minus n plus 1 then we subtract n
126:27 - we just have 1 over n times n plus 1
126:31 - right and so that's roughly 1 over n
126:35 - squared
126:36 - p series p equals 2 bigger than 1
126:39 - converges so we're pretty sure it
126:40 - converges but
126:43 - we don't necessarily know what it
126:44 - converges to
126:46 - so here's here's where we can kind of
126:48 - play around with this and we say okay
126:49 - well let's start looking at the partial
126:51 - sums
126:52 - s1 one minus a half
126:57 - okay s2
127:01 - we get 1 minus a half
127:04 - right there's the n equals 1 term now we
127:07 - add the n equals 2 term
127:10 - one half minus the third
127:14 - s3
127:18 - we have one minus a half
127:22 - plus a half minus the third
127:25 - and now we go for the n equals three
127:27 - term
127:29 - third minus a quarter and maybe
127:32 - now you can sort of see what's going on
127:34 - right we can we could regroup this
127:38 - as one minus a half
127:43 - plus a half so half minus half in there
127:45 - all right
127:48 - minus a third so one
127:52 - minus a third right here we can regroup
127:55 - this as
127:57 - one half minus a half
128:01 - all right and then
128:05 - third minus a third all right and then
128:08 - minus a quarter
128:11 - so we get one
128:14 - minus a quarter right
128:18 - and you can probably guess what's going
128:20 - to happen for the next one right so in
128:21 - general
128:22 - if we went down to sn we would have
128:27 - one minus a half and then plus a half
128:31 - minus
128:32 - a third and then plus the third
128:35 - minus a quarter and so on
128:40 - down to you know well so the very last
128:43 - term will be one over n
128:45 - minus one over n plus one and of course
128:48 - just before that
128:50 - there would have been a minus 1 over n
128:55 - n minus 1 so on and so
128:59 - basically everything cancels right
129:02 - there's a quarter there that will cancel
129:03 - with that those will cancel those will
129:05 - cancel
129:06 - and you just get one minus one over
129:10 - n plus one all right
129:14 - well now we know what the uh we know
129:17 - what we get because we
129:19 - we know that a series is just equal to
129:23 - the limit of the sequence of partial
129:26 - sums right
129:27 - so it's the limit and going to infinity
129:30 - of 1 over
129:31 - 1 minus 1 over n plus 1.
129:34 - that's going to go to 0 so we get a
129:37 - limit of 1.
129:43 - okay here are two more examples start
129:46 - with this one
129:47 - now this certainly doesn't look like a
129:49 - telescoping series but remember the
129:50 - previous one
129:52 - i pointed out you know they've given to
129:54 - us as one over n subtract one over n
129:56 - plus one i think it was that if you put
129:58 - it over a common denominator
130:00 - then you get something that looks like
130:02 - this right we said hey you can sort of
130:03 - do like a p
130:04 - series sort of thing on it if you wanted
130:06 - to um but of course you may also need to
130:08 - reverse that process
130:10 - so we might have to say okay let's work
130:12 - over on the side and say
130:15 - okay we've got 2 over n times n plus
130:18 - 2 right rational function
130:22 - we can do partial fractions
130:25 - a over n b
130:28 - over n plus 2.
130:32 - right so how do we solve for these
130:36 - remember
130:37 - if we multiply everything by n we have a
130:39 - isolated put in n
130:40 - is equal to zero this disappears it's
130:43 - gone from there
130:44 - putting n equal to zero because two over
130:46 - two so
130:49 - a is one if i multiply everything by n
130:52 - plus
130:52 - two this will disappear when we plug in
130:55 - -2 that'll just be b
130:57 - this is gone put in minus 2 2 over minus
131:00 - 2
131:02 - b is minus 1. okay so we can rewrite
131:05 - this
131:08 - as the sum and going from one
131:12 - to infinity of
131:17 - sorry something fell off the light
131:20 - still working let's keep going
131:25 - 1 over n plus 2. all right
131:29 - start writing out the partial sum see if
131:30 - we can figure out what's going on
131:32 - okay so we have you know
131:36 - let's just write it kind of a general
131:37 - one what it's going to look like s n
131:39 - okay so n equals one i have one minus
131:43 - a third then let's go to two
131:48 - one half minus a quarter oh it doesn't
131:51 - look promising
131:52 - does it oh but let's go to three
131:55 - a third minus a fifth let's go to four
132:00 - a quarter minus a sixth
132:04 - and so on so we actually do get some
132:07 - cancellation we eventually get some
132:09 - cancellation right
132:10 - uh the one-third cancels with the
132:12 - one-third
132:13 - one-quarter will cancel with one quarter
132:16 - right
132:17 - that one-fifth is going to cancel with
132:18 - the 1 over 5 and the next one
132:20 - the 1 over 6 is going to cancel with
132:22 - something in the next one
132:24 - but the one half the one half survives
132:27 - so we get one
132:31 - plus a half you know and
132:35 - pretty much everything else is going to
132:36 - cancel
132:38 - down to well we're going to have a
132:41 - couple terms left over right
132:44 - and that was going to be that's from
132:47 - n equals four yeah
132:52 - so we have one over n plus one
132:56 - so simplifies down to there
133:00 - okay and if n goes to infinity well
133:03 - these are going to go to zero
133:05 - and those stick around right
133:08 - so if we take the limit as n goes to
133:10 - infinity we're just left with one plus a
133:11 - half
133:13 - so we get three over two for the limit
133:17 - okay come to this last one well that
133:20 - definitely doesn't look like
133:22 - a harmonic or sorry a telescoping series
133:27 - but maybe we can do something weight can
133:29 - we do something with it ah yes
133:30 - log properties right we know that
133:34 - log of n plus one over n
133:38 - okay is the same thing as log n
133:41 - plus one minus log
133:45 - n okay so that means if we start writing
133:49 - out the partial sums right
133:50 - s n right is going to be
133:54 - well first of all log 2
133:58 - minus log 1 which is just 0
134:01 - right plus log 3 minus
134:06 - log 2 right
134:09 - then it's going to be log of 4
134:14 - minus log of 3 and then
134:18 - log of 5 minus log of
134:22 - 4 and so on
134:27 - down to log of n plus 1
134:31 - minus log of n
134:34 - okay so now we look for cancellations
134:37 - right
134:38 - log 3 cancels with log 3
134:42 - log 2 cancels with log 2
134:47 - log 4 is going to cancel with log 4
134:51 - right the next term would be log 6 minus
134:54 - log
134:54 - 5. log 5's cancel
134:58 - actually everything cancels except for
135:04 - except for that so
135:07 - the nth partial sum
135:11 - is the natural log of n plus 1. okay
135:14 - but if we let n go to infinity on that
135:18 - we don't get a value right it's infinite
135:21 - so this diverges
135:25 - it diverges if you like you might add it
135:27 - diverges to infinity
135:29 - but the main point is it diverges
135:36 - all right we have three series here on
135:38 - the board that we want to try to
135:40 - evaluate
135:40 - um the strategy for all of these is
135:43 - going to be to work with some basic
135:44 - properties for series
135:46 - and a few known results some of which
135:48 - i've mentioned previously
135:50 - some of which are summarized in the
135:51 - textbook we'll we'll point them out as
135:53 - we go
135:55 - so a couple of the properties that we
135:58 - are going to rely on here
135:59 - are going to be things like if you have
136:01 - the series of a sum
136:08 - you can write that as a sum of a series
136:14 - so some of the ans
136:19 - some of the bn's and if you have a
136:24 - common constant multiple
136:28 - say c times a n inside the series you
136:31 - can factor it out
136:35 - okay and the reason you can do that
136:38 - is that well
136:42 - for each of the partial sums right for a
136:44 - partial sum it's just a
136:45 - constant multiple you can factor it out
136:48 - and then the series of course is the
136:50 - limit
136:52 - of that sequence of partial sums and we
136:54 - know that for limits if you have a
136:55 - constant multiple inside the limit you
136:57 - can bring it out
136:58 - similar arguments will work here right
137:00 - um
137:01 - we know that for finite sums this is
137:03 - valid we also know that the limit of a
137:06 - sum is some of the limits and so we can
137:08 - we can make that argument to get those
137:09 - things to work okay
137:12 - so let's come to something like this n
137:15 - going from 1 to infinity we've got minus
137:17 - 1 to the n n squared minus
137:19 - n over n cubed how are we going to deal
137:21 - with it well
137:24 - let's try manipulating a little bit
137:26 - first
137:28 - so n going from 1 to infinity let's
137:30 - leave that minus 1
137:32 - to the n plus 1 out front and notice
137:36 - that
137:37 - we can divide each of these individually
137:39 - by n
137:40 - right so n squared over n cubed is just
137:43 - 1 over n
137:44 - n over n cubed is 1 over n
137:49 - squared okay so we can split it up like
137:52 - that
137:54 - so then we can write this if we multiply
137:56 - that through
138:00 - and we split this up into two series we
138:02 - can write it like this
138:04 - minus 1 to the n plus 1
138:07 - over n subtract
138:11 - sum and going from 1 to infinity
138:15 - minus 1 to the n plus 1
138:20 - over n squared okay
138:24 - now each of these turn out to be known
138:27 - results and these are not things that
138:28 - you're supposed to
138:30 - know how to come up with or establish at
138:31 - this point they're just results that
138:34 - somebody somewhere in the past has
138:36 - proved they're given to us in the
138:37 - textbook as a list of known values and
138:39 - so we're just going to use them
138:41 - this first one here
138:45 - is the natural log of 2. i think i've
138:48 - got that
138:49 - right the minus sign might be off by
138:52 - minus 1 but
138:53 - no i think that's right and this one
138:56 - here
138:57 - it turns out that this one is pi
139:00 - squared over 12.
139:05 - why i don't know there's some fairly
139:08 - sophisticated mathematics that probably
139:09 - goes into establishing that well beyond
139:11 - what we're doing in this course
139:13 - but there you have it right you can get
139:14 - that answer
139:16 - how about something like this well we
139:19 - can use the constant multiple rule
139:22 - and we can write it as
139:26 - 1000 times the sum and going from 1
139:30 - to infinity of 1 over n
139:33 - factorial now one of the known results
139:35 - that's given to us in the book says that
139:38 - if this sum started at 0 the sum going
139:40 - from 0 to infinity of 1 over n factorial
139:43 - is actually equal to e to euler's number
139:45 - so the sum is starting at the wrong
139:47 - point but that's
139:48 - okay we can we can modify that
139:51 - we can say all right if i started the
139:53 - sum at zero
139:56 - um well what does the n equals zero term
139:58 - look like the n equals zero term is just
140:00 - one over one factor
140:01 - or 1 over 0 factorial which is just 1
140:04 - right so by starting the sum 1 earlier
140:07 - i've added 1.
140:09 - so i can subtract 1 to balance
140:12 - okay and then i know that this is
140:16 - e and that's well minus 1.
140:19 - okay so we can get that answer
140:23 - again we will actually see later on why
140:26 - this is equal to e once we've done power
140:29 - series taylor series
140:30 - we'll see why that's equal to e but
140:31 - we're not there yet
140:33 - all right this last one well what do we
140:36 - have
140:37 - we have 1 over 4 squared
140:41 - plus 1 over 5 squared plus 1 over
140:45 - 6 squared 1 over 7 squared
140:49 - so we've got the sum n going from
140:52 - 4 to infinity of 1 over n
140:56 - squared okay well that is the same thing
141:00 - as the sum
141:01 - and going from 1 to infinity of 1 over n
141:05 - squared
141:06 - if we subtract off the n equals 1 term
141:11 - the n equals 2 term and the n equals
141:17 - 3 terms sorry 3 squared is 9.
141:22 - right oops there i'll get it right
141:24 - eventually
141:26 - okay um and this one over n squared
141:29 - that's that result we've mentioned
141:31 - already
141:31 - this is pi squared over six
141:35 - and this here i mean i guess if we want
141:37 - to get the common denominator
141:38 - 36 do we really want to do it uh why not
141:43 - 36 minus 9
141:46 - well let's add them 36 plus sign 45 plus
141:49 - 4
141:52 - 39 sorry 49
141:55 - 49
141:58 - over 36
142:02 - for our answer
142:09 - all right so in the previous videos we
142:12 - introduced the notion of a series an
142:14 - infinite series as the sum of the terms
142:16 - in a sequence
142:18 - we talked about convergence and
142:19 - divergence we gave a couple of examples
142:22 - of series where we can actually compute
142:25 - the sum
142:26 - so we talked about geometric series we
142:28 - started with telescoping series
142:30 - and we saw how to decide whether or not
142:31 - those converge or diverge
142:34 - we also introduced the p-test for
142:36 - convergence of a series although at the
142:38 - time we didn't really have a
142:39 - justification for it
142:41 - now we start getting into some of the
142:44 - tests for convergence that will let us
142:46 - decide whether or not
142:48 - a series converges or diverges right now
142:50 - these tests are not going to
142:52 - help us find the value for a series if
142:55 - it does converge they're simply going to
142:56 - answer this question
142:57 - yes or no does it converge the first one
143:01 - is the integral test so here's the
143:03 - statement of the integral test
143:05 - so we start with a function it does have
143:07 - two requirements and if you are going to
143:09 - apply the integral test it's important
143:11 - that you
143:12 - confirm that these requirements are
143:13 - verified the function has to be positive
143:17 - it has to be decreasing the
143:21 - one place where there's maybe a little
143:22 - bit of flexibility here
143:25 - is you could always replace this number
143:28 - one
143:29 - by some other value maybe replace that
143:32 - by some integer
143:34 - k maybe you want to start at zero maybe
143:37 - maybe you have a function that isn't
143:39 - decreasing
143:41 - everywhere but you know for x bigger
143:43 - than or equal to
143:44 - 10 it is decreasing well then maybe you
143:46 - want to start at k is equal to 10
143:48 - right and then of course if you make
143:51 - that change you would make the
143:52 - corresponding change down here
143:54 - and here okay
143:58 - so we do this standard thing where
144:02 - we talked about it those sequences we
144:03 - can always define a sequence
144:05 - if we have any function that's defined
144:08 - for at least all positive real numbers
144:10 - we can restrict the domain to the
144:12 - natural numbers
144:13 - and that gives us a sequence so the
144:15 - integral test says the convergence
144:18 - of the series where we sum the terms in
144:20 - this sequence convergence to that series
144:22 - is equivalent to convergence of the
144:25 - corresponding integral right
144:26 - so the if and only if is saying well if
144:29 - this converges so does this
144:31 - if this converges so does this or if you
144:33 - want to put it another way
144:35 - if this diverges so does this right so
144:37 - we look at this integral
144:38 - if it converges we know that this one
144:40 - converges if it diverges
144:41 - we know this one diverges and the idea
144:43 - here is we already have some practice
144:45 - with improper integrals and figuring out
144:47 - whether or not improper integrals
144:48 - converge or diverge
144:49 - and so anything that we learned about
144:52 - improper integrals and convergence of
144:54 - improper integrals can now be
144:56 - applied to convergence of series as long
144:58 - as we can
145:00 - put our series in this form for the
145:02 - appropriate type of function
145:04 - now if you want to see why this works
145:08 - it's actually pretty simple
145:11 - all right let's draw some coordinate
145:13 - axes let's draw
145:15 - a function which is positive and
145:16 - decreasing
145:21 - something like that okay
145:24 - and of course it needs to decrease to
145:27 - zero
145:28 - i mean it's not in the statement of the
145:30 - theorem but we know that if it doesn't
145:31 - decrease to zero
145:33 - we know that this is not going to
145:34 - converge and we know that that's not
145:35 - going to converge
145:37 - so better decrease the zero right
145:41 - and now we can mark off
145:45 - all the integer points
145:49 - one two three 4 6
145:52 - 7 8 9 and so on
145:55 - all right and we can think about area
145:58 - under the curve and we can think in
145:59 - terms of riemann sums all right so we're
146:01 - going to do
146:03 - you know so we can think about doing now
146:04 - i mean we really shouldn't talk about
146:06 - riemann sums we're talking about
146:08 - improper integrals because riemann sums
146:10 - need a closed interval to work with but
146:12 - um we can just go with sort of a fixed
146:14 - you know
146:16 - delta x equals one so we look at
146:17 - intervals of length one
146:19 - all right and if we do say left
146:22 - endpoints
146:25 - remember that when we do a riemann sum
146:26 - we can choose where on each interval we
146:29 - want to
146:30 - pick our point so if we do
146:33 - delta x equals one left endpoints well
146:35 - then we get
146:42 - something that looks like this
146:45 - all right
146:56 - okay and so on and so one of the things
146:58 - that you can see right away
147:00 - is that well what are these values right
147:04 - this
147:04 - is the point 1
147:08 - f of 1 right
147:11 - this is the point 2 f of
147:14 - 2 and so on um
147:17 - the sum that we get right we get
147:22 - the sum and going from one and i guess
147:25 - we can continue all the way to infinity
147:27 - of f of n but f of n is just a n
147:32 - right times delta x but delta x is just
147:34 - one so we get the series actually right
147:36 - and what this is saying is that that
147:38 - series well that must be
147:42 - bigger then the corresponding integral
147:45 - right
147:49 - okay because
147:53 - we can see that we have a little bit
147:54 - extra in each rectangle
147:57 - so if we knew that this integral
147:59 - diverges if we know this integral
148:01 - diverges well and certainly the series
148:02 - has to diverge as well right because
148:04 - this is infinite so is that because it's
148:05 - bigger right
148:07 - um but you know you could equivalently
148:09 - decide that you're going to do
148:13 - maybe delta x equals 1 but you want to
148:16 - do right endpoints
148:21 - right so then we would get
148:28 - the underestimate right
148:31 - we use right endpoints we get that
148:35 - okay and so
148:38 - if we use right endpoints well
148:41 - then again this would be kind of f of 2
148:45 - we're using f of 3 for the second
148:46 - rectangle f of 4 for the third and so on
148:50 - so we actually get we still get the sum
148:54 - of a n but actually n starts at two
148:58 - okay and starts at two and that amount
149:01 - is going to be
149:03 - less than the integral
149:09 - okay all right now that's not quite our
149:13 - series but
149:16 - if the sum starting at 2 converges
149:19 - well then certainly the entire sum
149:21 - converges because we can always just add
149:23 - right we can just do this we can say
149:24 - okay that's fine just add
149:26 - a 1 to both sides
149:30 - now you have the series right this is
149:34 - n equals 1 to infinity of a n
149:38 - and of course if this integral converges
149:41 - adding a number to it is not going to
149:42 - change the convergence of the integral
149:44 - um so if this converges this value is
149:46 - finite this is less
149:48 - so we expect that it should converge as
149:50 - well right um
149:52 - and yes i mean i'll i guess all this
149:55 - really
149:56 - you know if we don't put any conditions
149:57 - on the function this just tells us that
149:59 - well this number is not going to become
150:00 - infinite
150:01 - maybe that doesn't mean that
150:05 - the series is going to converge because
150:07 - you know what if what if the values
150:08 - bounce around a bit right
150:10 - well that's where you know the function
150:12 - we're saying the function has to be
150:13 - function has to be positive right so
150:16 - we're always so that means that all the
150:18 - a
150:18 - n's are positive so we can't have some
150:20 - series that
150:21 - oscillates back and forth because if
150:23 - we're jumping back and forth we'd have
150:24 - to be adding negative values we're not
150:26 - allowing that
150:27 - right and we need the decreasing
150:31 - condition as well
150:32 - again just to make sure that everything
150:34 - fits together the way it should
150:37 - but that's the integral test right so
150:39 - the way you apply the integral test is
150:41 - somebody hands you a series says does
150:42 - this converge well you look at the terms
150:45 - in this series and you say okay
150:46 - can i identify those terms with the
150:49 - values of some function
150:51 - if i can does the function have these
150:54 - properties
150:54 - or does it at least eventually have
150:56 - those properties
150:58 - if it does then you look at the
151:00 - corresponding improper integral
151:02 - um hopefully it's one that you know how
151:03 - to evaluate or at least decide on the
151:05 - convergence of
151:06 - and if you can decide whether or not the
151:08 - improper integral converges or diverges
151:10 - well then you can apply the theorem and
151:12 - you know whether or not your series
151:14 - converges or diverges
151:20 - all right so here's our first example
151:22 - where we're going to apply the integral
151:24 - test to determine the convergence
151:26 - or i guess well determine the
151:28 - convergence of
151:30 - m yeah so we mean decide if it converges
151:32 - or diverges right
151:34 - so we under determine the conversions of
151:35 - this series does it converge does it
151:37 - diverge
151:38 - all right so we make some
151:40 - identifications we say all right
151:42 - the terms are natural log of
151:47 - n over n squared that's what a n looks
151:50 - like
151:52 - and we can write that as f of n
151:57 - where our function f of x is
152:00 - the natural log of x
152:04 - divided by x squared so we got to check
152:08 - our conditions right um is it positive
152:11 - it's positive as long as the natural log
152:13 - is positive and that's true
152:18 - as long as x is bigger than 1
152:21 - right log of 1 is zero so the first term
152:25 - in this
152:25 - in this series is actually zero so
152:28 - really we should say that
152:29 - uh n starts at two right we can at we
152:32 - can put n equals one in there with the n
152:34 - equals one term is zero we're adding
152:35 - zero it doesn't change anything
152:38 - is it decreasing
152:45 - how do we check if it's decreasing well
152:50 - we could appeal to the definition and
152:52 - say okay i want to show that if x2 is
152:54 - bigger than x1 then f of x2 should be
152:56 - smaller than f of x1
152:58 - right um there are like sort of these
153:00 - like difference tests or ratio tests
153:02 - that you can apply to the sequence to
153:04 - see but
153:05 - it's a function of x it's a
153:06 - differentiable function of x we know how
153:08 - to decide if a differentiable function
153:09 - of x is decreasing
153:11 - we look at the derivative right
153:15 - let's look at the derivative f prime of
153:16 - x is going to be
153:18 - well let's do quotient rule derivative
153:20 - of the top
153:22 - 1 over x times x squared
153:26 - minus derivative of the bottom
153:29 - times the top
153:33 - divided by the bottom squared x to the
153:35 - 4.
153:36 - so this is going to be x times
153:40 - 1 minus 2 log x
153:45 - over x to the 4.
153:49 - okay um we need this to be negative
153:52 - when is this going to be negative it's
153:53 - going to be less than zero
153:55 - well it's going to be less than zero
153:56 - let's see well x can't be less than zero
153:58 - right it's a natural log x
153:59 - negative numbers aren't in the domain so
154:02 - it's going to be less than zero
154:05 - if one minus half log x
154:09 - is less than zero sorry one minus two
154:12 - log x
154:14 - is less than zero um
154:18 - and that's if let's see that's if
154:22 - the natural log of x is bigger than
154:25 - a half and that's going to be true
154:31 - if x is bigger than or equal to 2.
154:33 - natural log of 2 is like 0.6 something i
154:37 - think
154:37 - um okay so we're good to start at 2
154:42 - right remember we we don't necessarily
154:44 - have to start at 1 in the statement of
154:45 - the theorem we can start at some k
154:46 - if we want to all right so we know that
154:49 - the theorem applies
154:52 - so now we look at the integral okay
154:59 - let's do that in green just so it stands
155:02 - apart from that
155:03 - we need to look at the integral
155:06 - from 2 to infinity we could do 1 if you
155:10 - want natural log of
155:13 - x over x squared
155:16 - times dx okay
155:19 - got to integrate by parts for this one
155:22 - let's kind of do that over and let's do
155:23 - the
155:23 - the indefinite integral over on the side
155:25 - just to remind ourselves how that goes
155:32 - so if we have a natural log that's
155:35 - always our u
155:36 - right so u is log x
155:39 - du is one over x dv
155:43 - one over x squared dx so v is
155:47 - minus one over x
155:50 - okay so we get minus
155:56 - log x over x
155:59 - plus the integral of
156:03 - v d u right so plus the integral
156:06 - plus because of the minus sign there
156:08 - plus integral of minus of one over x
156:10 - squared
156:12 - okay so we get
156:15 - minus log x over x
156:18 - minus one over x and
156:21 - i mean plus your c if you want to put
156:23 - the c in there
156:26 - okay so that means that this integral
156:28 - will be
156:30 - it'll be the limit as
156:33 - so let's say n goes to infinity
156:37 - of minus
156:41 - log n over n
156:45 - minus 1 over n
156:48 - okay that's the upper limit plug in the
156:51 - lower limit
156:52 - two log
156:55 - two over two okay
156:59 - plus one half and
157:03 - we just check now that this limit here
157:06 - is zero certainly that goes to zero uh
157:09 - one application of l'hopital's rule
157:10 - tells you that that one goes to zero
157:12 - right because derivative of the top
157:13 - gives you the one over n over the bottom
157:15 - gives you one
157:16 - and so we know that that limit is just
157:18 - zero
157:19 - so we get this finite value for the
157:21 - integral right integral converges
157:24 - and so we can state our conclusion we
157:26 - can say
157:27 - since the integral
157:33 - log x over x x squared it was
157:37 - sorry since that converges
157:45 - so does
157:49 - the sum and going from 1 or 2 if you
157:51 - want 2 to infinity
157:53 - of log
157:56 - n over n squared
158:00 - okay by the integral test
158:06 - all right so next we're going to prove a
158:09 - result that was promised in the previous
158:11 - section
158:11 - and we're going to prove the p-test
158:14 - we'll do it in general of course you can
158:16 - set a equal to 1 be equal to 0 and get
158:18 - the regular p-test
158:21 - but we'll we'll do the general version
158:23 - because of course that
158:24 - if we prove it in general it's going to
158:25 - apply the to the special case as well
158:29 - one thing that we should probably
158:30 - require though i think
158:32 - just well certainly i think
158:36 - we should specify that a is positive
158:40 - if a is equal to zero then this is just
158:42 - these are just constants and then we're
158:43 - adding up a constant and it's going to
158:45 - diverge right so
158:46 - we need a to be positive um if a was
158:49 - negative well you could factor the minus
158:50 - sign out you get a minus one to the p
158:52 - it's either plus or minus right it's
158:55 - constant multiple we don't worry about
158:56 - that
158:58 - and also just to simplify things for us
159:03 - let's assume that b is bigger than or
159:04 - equal to zero okay
159:07 - we'll assume that as well because if b
159:11 - is if b is negative then then we
159:14 - introduce the possibility that there
159:16 - might be a zero in the denominator for
159:17 - some value of n
159:19 - um and even even if that
159:22 - zero in the denominator doesn't occur at
159:24 - an integer even if it occurs at some
159:26 - rational
159:26 - value or i mean these could be real
159:28 - numbers or it could be some real number
159:29 - value
159:31 - it would still be the case that there's
159:33 - a vertical asymptote somewhere
159:35 - right um and if that vertical asymptote
159:38 - occurs somewhere between like let's say
159:40 - it occurs between n equals five and n
159:42 - equals six or something like that
159:44 - um well we won't have a positive
159:46 - decreasing function until we cross the
159:48 - vertical asymptote
159:50 - so we can handle that we just modify
159:53 - things right a finite number of terms
159:55 - doesn't affect convergence we can always
159:56 - start at some other value
159:58 - but just to keep life simple assume that
160:01 - b is bigger than equal to zero
160:03 - um so we don't have to worry about an
160:04 - asymptote okay
160:06 - at least we don't have to worry about an
160:07 - asymptote that happens for
160:09 - positive values of n right okay
160:12 - very good so with that in place
160:17 - basic graph transformations should tell
160:19 - you what this thing looks like right the
160:21 - graph of um let's see so what are we
160:24 - going to do
160:24 - well first of all our a n a sub n
160:27 - looks like 1 over
160:32 - a n sorry
160:36 - a times n
160:42 - plus b to the power of p
160:46 - right and so that is
160:49 - equal to f of n for a function
160:53 - f of x given by 1
160:56 - over a x plus
161:00 - b to the p okay
161:03 - and that's just some transformed version
161:07 - of 1 over x to the p and 1 over x to the
161:11 - p
161:11 - assuming that p is positive here right
161:15 - typically it's going to look like that
161:18 - right
161:19 - this half will either be here or there
161:22 - depending on whether p
161:23 - is auto or even get something that looks
161:26 - like that
161:26 - so we we get the positive decreasing
161:29 - function that we're supposed to have
161:31 - so we look at the integral we say okay
161:33 - what do we get
161:36 - let's do the indefinite integral first
161:39 - so 1 over
161:41 - a x plus b to the power p
161:48 - integrate with respect to x okay now
161:51 - we know that if
161:55 - if p is equal to one
161:59 - well then we get this is going to give
162:02 - me
162:02 - 1 over a times the natural log of ax
162:07 - plus b and we know that as x goes to
162:10 - infinity that's going to blow up on us
162:11 - okay
162:16 - so we know it diverges if p is equal to
162:18 - 1.
162:19 - so we're going to assume here
162:28 - assume that p is not equal to one well
162:31 - if p
162:31 - is not equal to one then this is just
162:34 - power rule right
162:36 - power rule and chain rule so that is so
162:39 - this is the integral of
162:41 - ax plus b to the minus p
162:46 - we add one to the exponent
162:49 - so we get minus p plus one one minus
162:52 - p if we drop that into the denominator
162:54 - that's going to be
162:56 - ax plus b to the p
162:59 - minus 1 1 over that
163:05 - oh but we also have to divide by a right
163:07 - there's a one over a
163:08 - coming from the chain rule so there's
163:11 - actually a out there
163:13 - okay plus your c if you like
163:16 - okay and so if we're looking at the
163:20 - improper integral so going from 1
163:25 - to infinity 1 over ax plus
163:29 - b to the p
163:32 - dx okay well we're going to get the
163:39 - limit as n goes to infinity 1
163:42 - over a times
163:45 - 1 over oh
163:49 - we also have to divide by we have to
163:50 - divide by the new exponent right
163:52 - forgot that um
163:56 - so we also have a p
163:59 - minus 1 in there or maybe minus 1 plus p
164:03 - so we also have that um right yeah
164:07 - so we have that we have minus p
164:11 - plus one we have one
164:14 - over ax plus
164:18 - b to the p minus one
164:22 - there's our or sorry n i guess i called
164:24 - it n
164:26 - there we go um minus the lower limit if
164:30 - we plug in
164:30 - one what do we get at the lower limit we
164:33 - put in x
164:34 - equal to 1 we get you know some constant
164:37 - right
164:38 - minus we get 1 over
164:41 - a times a plus b
164:45 - times 1 minus p it's a constant
164:49 - um and so we look at this and we say
164:51 - yeah this this here limit
164:55 - what can we say about it
164:58 - this limit is going to be equal to zero
165:03 - is long as p minus one
165:06 - is positive and it's going to be equal
165:10 - to
165:10 - infinity if p minus one
165:14 - is negative right we've already ruled
165:17 - out the p is equal to one case
165:18 - um okay so it's going to converge if p
165:22 - minus one is positive which is the same
165:23 - thing as saying that p is bigger than
165:25 - one
165:26 - which is what we had here right and
165:29 - if and only if because if p is not
165:32 - bigger than one
165:33 - then either um it's equal to one and we
165:37 - know it diverges or it's less than one
165:39 - and we know it diverges okay so either
165:41 - way
165:42 - we know that we have a convergent
165:44 - improper integral if p is bigger than
165:46 - one
165:47 - and so correspondingly we have a
165:49 - convergent
165:50 - p series if p is bigger than one
165:58 - so the next theorem that we want to look
166:00 - at is the direct
166:01 - comparison test okay um so we've stated
166:04 - here's a theorem and the this is the
166:08 - sentence which is direct comparison
166:10 - right here
166:12 - okay so this is
166:16 - direct comparison
166:22 - so if you're able to set up a direct
166:25 - comparison this is typically the
166:27 - simplest argument that you can give for
166:28 - convergence of
166:30 - a series i if we have one series
166:33 - which we know converges and it's easy to
166:36 - show that the terms in some other
166:38 - series are always less than or equal to
166:39 - the corresponding terms in the
166:40 - convergence series
166:42 - then this one must automatically
166:43 - converge as well
166:45 - conversely if if this
166:48 - series diverges right and the other
166:51 - series has terms which are larger
166:53 - then it has to diverge as well one thing
166:56 - that is important here
166:58 - is that they do have to be positive
167:02 - sequences okay the fact that they're
167:05 - positive right means that
167:08 - well if we
167:11 - if we let
167:14 - um let's say
167:18 - s n
167:21 - to be the sum n going from 1
167:26 - to big n
167:29 - of n and let's call the other one i
167:33 - don't know maybe
167:34 - t just because it's the next letter in
167:35 - the alphabet i call
167:37 - t n sum and going from one
167:41 - to n of b n um
167:45 - so if we define these
167:50 - if we have that and that
167:54 - then these sequences
167:58 - sn and tn
168:03 - well they have to be monotone
168:10 - increasing right because we started with
168:12 - positive sequences so every time we add
168:14 - a new term
168:16 - the sum gets bigger okay so they're
168:18 - monotone increasing
168:21 - this is a useful observation to make one
168:24 - thing that tells us is that
168:25 - if we do have a divergence series if
168:27 - this sum diverges
168:29 - okay well it has to diverge to infinity
168:32 - right has to diverge for infinity
168:35 - the other thing we notice is that
168:41 - well s n
168:44 - has to be always less than or equal to
168:48 - t n maybe i should have used a different
168:51 - letter here
168:52 - um let's call that ten or n naught or
168:54 - something okay
168:56 - for n
168:59 - bigger than or equal to this n naught
169:01 - right so we always allow that
169:03 - maybe your comparison doesn't quite work
169:05 - at the beginning but it works eventually
169:07 - right
169:07 - when we can when we're talking about
169:09 - conversions of series we always care
169:10 - about what happens eventually
169:13 - first few terms aren't that important
169:14 - right first hundred terms thousand terms
169:16 - million terms aren't necessarily
169:17 - important it's only what happens
169:19 - eventually that matters
169:20 - okay so maybe this is a big number it
169:23 - doesn't matter
169:24 - as long as we have this eventually okay
169:27 - so what that tells me is that
169:30 - well
169:35 - if the limit as
169:38 - n goes to infinity
169:41 - of s n is infinity
169:48 - then the limit as n goes to infinity of
169:52 - t tn must also be infinity
169:56 - right um if we have this inequality for
169:59 - all n right
170:01 - this quantity is always bigger than that
170:03 - quantity if this is becoming infinite
170:05 - this one must also become infinite
170:07 - you can prove that straight from the
170:09 - definition of the limit if you want
170:11 - okay on the other hand and so by the way
170:14 - this
170:21 - this proves the second part of the
170:24 - theorem right
170:26 - if s n goes to infinity right that's
170:28 - saying that this
170:29 - series diverges which tells us that this
170:31 - one diverges
170:34 - on the other hand
170:40 - if the limit as
170:44 - n goes to infinity of
170:47 - let's say t n is
170:50 - some value let's i don't know call it
170:54 - uh b why not
170:57 - um well what can we say then
171:02 - well we know that
171:07 - s n has to be less than or equal to t
171:11 - n but t n has to be less than or equal
171:16 - to b
171:18 - right because if if tn is an
171:21 - increasing sequence right it's an
171:23 - increasing sequence
171:25 - it has to be less than or equal to its
171:27 - limit okay
171:29 - because it gets bigger as n increases so
171:31 - does
171:32 - so does tn okay
171:36 - well that means that
171:41 - this sequence is
171:46 - bounded and it's increasing
171:55 - so what do we know about bounded
171:56 - increasing sequences
171:58 - we have the monotone convergence theorem
172:00 - says if you have a bounded increasing
172:02 - sequence
172:03 - it has to converge okay so that's
172:06 - exactly the scenario of the
172:08 - first right so that means that
172:12 - that this sequence
172:15 - converges
172:19 - which is the same thing as saying that
172:21 - the series converges
172:26 - and
172:28 - that proves the first part
172:32 - okay in case you're wondering why it's
172:35 - true there's the argument
172:37 - so direct comparison is pretty
172:38 - straightforward it makes intuitive sense
172:41 - right that if
172:43 - if these numbers are always bigger than
172:44 - those numbers if this converges well
172:47 - this should converge to something
172:48 - smaller
172:49 - it makes sense right similarly
172:52 - if this diverges well this should be
172:55 - bigger than that so it should diverge as
172:56 - well
172:57 - makes sense next we'll look at some
173:00 - examples so we can see how we actually
173:02 - apply this in
173:04 - in practice right and the challenge with
173:06 - using direct comparison
173:09 - is here it's getting that inequality
173:12 - right it's easier said than done
173:13 - sometimes it's straightforward and you
173:15 - can see the inequality and you set it up
173:16 - straight away and everyone's happy
173:19 - sometimes it's tough so we'll look at
173:21 - some easy examples we'll look at some
173:23 - tough examples
173:25 - and then just like for improper
173:26 - integrals when direct comparison fails
173:29 - you ask whether or not there's some sort
173:31 - of limit comparison that you can use and
173:33 - fortunately the answer will be yes
173:40 - all right so here is a quick and easy
173:43 - candidate for direct comparison all
173:45 - right we want to decide if this
173:46 - particular series converges or diverges
173:50 - you might say hey i know i know
173:52 - something about geometric series and
173:53 - when they converge i also know some of
173:54 - the p
173:55 - series and when they converge here we
173:57 - seem to have the two of them sort of
173:58 - jumbled together
173:59 - well what do you do
174:02 - there's actually kind of two ways you
174:04 - could do this right you could say well
174:05 - here's one
174:06 - option we could say
174:14 - since 1 over 3 to the n
174:18 - plus n squared is less than 1
174:21 - over 3 to the n
174:24 - y why is that true well whatever n is
174:28 - right n squared is a positive number if
174:29 - you add a positive number on the
174:31 - denominator right you're making the
174:32 - denominator bigger
174:34 - that makes the whole thing smaller right
174:37 - so this should be
174:38 - a larger number over here and we know
174:41 - that
174:46 - this converges
174:51 - right well we should probably say y
174:56 - it's geometric with
174:59 - r equals
175:02 - one-third which is less than one
175:07 - then we know that
175:12 - our series converges
175:17 - by
175:21 - comparison that's it that's all you got
175:23 - to say right
175:25 - but make sure you check the boxes what
175:28 - are you comparing two
175:30 - the thing that you're comparing to why
175:31 - does it converge it's geometric
175:35 - why do we know the other one converges
175:36 - well because we're using the comparison
175:38 - test right
175:41 - we should also keep an eye on the
175:42 - requirement that terms be positive but
175:44 - we've got that going for us as well
175:47 - okay now of course you could have gone
175:50 - in another direction with this you could
175:52 - have also said hey
175:54 - i don't need to compare to the geometric
175:56 - series i could also compare
175:58 - all right this one gave us two options
176:00 - we could have also said
176:02 - hey 3 to the n over n squared for the
176:05 - same reasoning
176:07 - is less than 1 over n squared
176:11 - right
176:14 - and i know that this
176:17 - series and going from 1 to infinity 1
176:19 - over n squared
176:20 - that converges y
176:26 - it's a p series
176:30 - p is equal to two which is bigger than
176:34 - one
176:35 - okay we know that this series
176:40 - converges
176:45 - okay same as before okay of course if we
176:48 - had
176:49 - if we only had say n here rather than n
176:51 - squared
176:53 - series is still going to converge but
176:54 - then option one is the only option right
176:56 - we wouldn't have been able to go to
176:57 - option two
176:58 - all right or you know if this
177:02 - was maybe like one half to the n in here
177:04 - or something where the g matrix series
177:06 - failed well again we could just then
177:07 - rely on the p series
177:09 - in this case we had both options at our
177:10 - disposal
177:12 - pick either one
177:18 - all right here's another example with
177:20 - comparison
177:22 - 1 over n minus log n what do we do with
177:25 - that
177:25 - well let's see
177:28 - you should probably suspect that this
177:31 - diverges
177:32 - why we know that the harmonic series 1
177:35 - over n we know that that diverges
177:36 - right and subtracting something off from
177:40 - n is only going to make the denominator
177:42 - smaller which is going to make the terms
177:44 - in this
177:45 - series bigger which should mean it still
177:48 - diverges
177:49 - and of course that's the whole point of
177:50 - the comparison test right
177:52 - so let's work that through what do we
177:55 - get
177:56 - uh well we notice that
178:01 - n has to be bigger than or equal to n
178:05 - minus the natural log of n okay
178:08 - um we're working here let's
178:12 - point out this is valid
178:16 - for n bigger than or equal to one right
178:19 - if n is less than one the natural log is
178:21 - negative and this side would actually be
178:22 - bigger
178:24 - but n is bigger than or equal to one so
178:25 - we don't have to worry
178:27 - okay n minus log n the other thing we
178:30 - should worry about though
178:32 - are these terms still positive yes they
178:35 - are
178:37 - that is still bigger than zero all right
178:41 - you can use calculus to check this if
178:43 - you want
178:44 - it's a pretty straightforward comparison
178:47 - to show that n
178:48 - is always bigger than log n okay this is
178:51 - always true
178:52 - um simple to set that up and show it
178:56 - so we know that the terms are positive
178:58 - we have that comparison
179:00 - well since both of these are positive we
179:02 - can take reciprocals
179:04 - inequality diverse reverses
179:09 - and we get that 1 over n
179:13 - is less than or equal to 1 over n
179:18 - minus the natural log of n okay
179:22 - very good and now we can say
179:27 - since the harmonic series
179:33 - diverges and
179:37 - you can however you want to reference
179:39 - this you can point out well it's the
179:40 - harmonic series and that was our like
179:42 - classic example of
179:44 - of a series that
179:48 - diverges despite the fact that the terms
179:50 - go to zero
179:51 - right so it's harmonic um
179:54 - or if you want it's a p series
179:58 - with p equal to one and it's not
180:01 - bigger than one so we know it's going to
180:03 - diverge
180:05 - and whichever reason you want to give we
180:06 - know it diverges
180:08 - we know that
180:11 - this series here 1 over n
180:14 - minus log of n
180:17 - that has to also diverge
180:22 - by comparison
180:26 - that's it we're done
180:33 - all right before we move on from direct
180:34 - comparison
180:36 - next topic is going to be the limit
180:37 - comparison test
180:39 - i'm going to do one more example with
180:40 - direct comparison and i want to do this
180:42 - example
180:43 - to try and convince you why the limit
180:45 - comparison test is useful
180:47 - right direct comparison is nice it gets
180:49 - you the answer really fast
180:52 - if you can set up that inequality if you
180:54 - can't set it up easily
180:56 - maybe you want something better so let's
180:58 - look at these two examples
181:00 - now a part a is straightforward
181:03 - okay let's look at the solution for part
181:05 - a
181:06 - for part a i can simply say
181:10 - that 1 over n squared plus
181:13 - n is now of course
181:17 - i can choose to drop either of these two
181:19 - they're both positive right if i remove
181:21 - either one of them from the sum i'm
181:22 - going to get
181:24 - a smaller number in the denominator so a
181:26 - bigger number overall
181:28 - but i want to keep the one that gives me
181:29 - a conversion series right so 1 over
181:33 - n squared and i know
181:37 - that
181:41 - this series here converges
181:46 - and again we know that converges because
181:50 - it's a p-test
181:53 - p is two it's bigger than one
181:57 - we know that
182:01 - this series converges as well
182:07 - and we can give the reason converges by
182:09 - comparison
182:14 - okay that's not so bad um
182:18 - what about part b so here's where things
182:21 - get a little bit tricky
182:24 - the the intuition that you want to apply
182:26 - is that for rational functions
182:29 - large powers dominate right and so we
182:32 - should look at this and say if i ignore
182:34 - the smaller powers this is effectively a
182:36 - p
182:36 - series p is equal to 2 2 is bigger than
182:38 - 1 i expect it should converge
182:40 - right but it's not exactly a p series
182:45 - so we have to try and compare to one
182:47 - right
182:48 - the only other difference you'll notice
182:49 - i started the sum at 2 because
182:52 - 1 minus 1 would give me a 0 in the
182:54 - denominator which is not good
182:55 - but as long as n is bigger than or equal
182:57 - to two n squared minus n is going to be
182:59 - positive so we have
183:01 - you know we have a positive sequence
183:03 - we're good to go on that
183:04 - um but we can't do the same sort of
183:08 - direct comparison that we just did right
183:10 - if we try it
183:12 - it's it's bound to fail because if i
183:14 - just drop the
183:16 - minus n right that subtracting n is
183:18 - making the denominator smaller
183:20 - if i remove it the denominator gets
183:21 - bigger the overall terms get
183:24 - smaller inequality goes the wrong way
183:27 - so i can't i can't use it right it
183:30 - doesn't work
183:31 - so what do we do well
183:35 - you start fiddling around and you just
183:36 - say like how can i how can i get this
183:38 - thing to go the right way
183:40 - so subtracting n how do we how do we fix
183:44 - it
183:45 - you can mess around there are options
183:47 - like maybe you try to complete the
183:48 - square
183:49 - or something like that i mean that
183:51 - actually is an option you could do that
183:53 - completing this square might work
183:56 - we might try to say something like well
183:59 - you know
183:59 - we know that
184:02 - we know that n
184:05 - n is bigger than or equal to 2 in this
184:08 - scenario
184:10 - if i multiply both sides by
184:14 - by n i know that
184:19 - n squared is bigger than or equal to
184:22 - 2n right i can multiply both as an
184:25 - inequality as long as the thing i'm
184:26 - multiplying by is positive
184:29 - and then i could also multiply by
184:33 - one half so one-half n squared
184:37 - would be greater than or equal to n
184:40 - okay or in other words
184:46 - minus n
184:49 - okay if i reverse the so move this over
184:52 - minus
184:53 - n will be bigger than or equal to minus
184:56 - one half
184:57 - n squared so i just swap the two sides
185:00 - um and now i can add n squared to both
185:03 - sides
185:05 - n squared minus n is bigger than or
185:07 - equal to
185:09 - n squared minus half n squared
185:13 - which is
185:17 - half n squared very good
185:22 - okay so with all that
185:25 - now i can say that
185:30 - i have my solution right so i can say
185:33 - this i can say
185:36 - since n squared minus
185:39 - n is bigger than or equal to one half
185:42 - n squared i know that one over n squared
185:46 - minus n is less than or equal to
185:51 - 2 over n squared
185:56 - and i know that the sum and going from 2
186:00 - to infinity of 2 over n squared
186:04 - converges again
186:08 - p test the 2 on top is a constant
186:09 - doesn't matter factor it out it's 1 over
186:11 - n squared
186:13 - i know that
186:16 - the sum for n squared minus n
186:21 - also converges and again it's by
186:27 - comparison by direct comparison all
186:29 - right but that direct comparison was a
186:31 - whole lot harder to set up than this one
186:34 - right you had to come up with this and
186:36 - then you probably don't necessarily come
186:38 - up with that idea
186:39 - on the spot right you're in the middle
186:41 - of an exam maybe you're not going to
186:42 - think about that
186:44 - that's where the limit comparison test
186:45 - comes in right limit comparison
186:48 - is the test to use with that intuition
186:51 - that highest powers are dominant right
186:54 - limit comparison says hey i want to
186:56 - compare this with 1 over n squared
186:58 - the direct comparison doesn't seem to be
187:00 - working out for me
187:01 - maybe there's a simpler way to set this
187:03 - up we'll see that in the next couple of
187:08 - videos
187:11 - all right so now we come to the limit
187:14 - comparison test
187:15 - right so it's still sort of a comparison
187:18 - test
187:19 - um setup is the same as direct
187:20 - comparison we have two positive
187:22 - sequences
187:23 - we're looking at convergence of the
187:24 - corresponding series okay
187:27 - and the limit comparison test is
187:30 - essentially trying to
187:31 - set up this this idea that if we kind of
187:35 - know in the long
187:36 - run how the two sequences compare right
187:40 - then sort of smaller differences
187:43 - that might matter for small values of n
187:45 - don't matter so much for larger values
187:47 - of n they're not so important we just
187:48 - wanted to look about
187:49 - sort of this sort of long term
187:51 - comparison how do they compare
187:53 - once n gets really big okay
187:56 - so if the limit of the ratio is
188:00 - l right what that's telling you is that
188:04 - for large values of n
188:07 - the terms in this sequence are
188:11 - roughly some multiple of the terms in
188:12 - this sequence right a n is approximately
188:15 - l
188:15 - times b n where l is some limit right
188:19 - so they they're kind of the same size
188:21 - right same order of magnitude they agree
188:23 - well
188:24 - not order of magnitude is not the right
188:25 - term but um they
188:27 - they're equal up to a constant multiple
188:29 - right and
188:31 - we know that as far as convergence of a
188:33 - series goes constant multiple doesn't
188:35 - matter if there's a constant multiple
188:36 - you can pull it out
188:37 - right and so
188:41 - these two sequence or these two series
188:43 - either they both converge or they both
188:44 - diverge because the
188:46 - the terms here are behave roughly the
188:49 - same as the terms here for
188:50 - long term right and convergence really
188:52 - depends on long-term behavior
188:54 - what happens for large values of n okay
188:58 - so and then of course it could be that
189:01 - you know so l
189:02 - here needs to be it needs to be positive
189:04 - right it can't be zero and it can't be
189:05 - infinity so what happens if it is zero
189:06 - or infinity
189:07 - uh well if the limit is zero
189:11 - what is that telling you that's telling
189:12 - you that these terms here the bns are
189:15 - growing much faster than the ans
189:17 - right so these ones are growing faster
189:20 - so that means that in the long run the
189:23 - bns are larger
189:24 - than the ans okay so now you're kind of
189:28 - back to direct comparison
189:29 - the bns are eventually larger than the
189:32 - ans otherwise that limit wouldn't be
189:33 - zero
189:34 - and so you know that if the sum of the
189:36 - bn's converges
189:38 - well the bn's are bigger than the n so
189:39 - the ands have to converge right
189:41 - essentially you turn it into into direct
189:43 - comparison
189:44 - okay on the other hand
189:47 - if the limit is infinity well that means
189:49 - that the a ends are growing much faster
189:51 - than the bn's right so the ans are
189:53 - larger in the long run and so if you
189:56 - know that this
189:57 - series diverges this one must as well
190:00 - right
190:00 - um so the the strategy here is always
190:03 - that you want to think of this as like
190:04 - the
190:05 - this series here right the a n this is
190:07 - sort of the one that you're given so you
190:09 - want to think of
190:10 - basically this
190:13 - this is like the the given series
190:17 - and this is the one that you're going to
190:19 - compare to
190:22 - right that's your comparison series um
190:24 - and
190:25 - so this might be you know this might be
190:28 - sort of complicated right you're given
190:29 - some complicated series
190:31 - you want to compare to something that is
190:34 - relatively
190:35 - simple something where you know what the
190:36 - answer is you know if it converges or
190:38 - diverges
190:39 - and and you you want them to be sort of
190:42 - roughly
190:42 - similar in in the sense of long-term
190:44 - behavior like if
190:45 - if if this is some rational expression
190:48 - well then you want to look at largest
190:50 - powers of n right and and
190:52 - set this up based on that um all right
190:54 - so
190:55 - typically you're setting things up so
190:56 - that you you're going to be you
190:58 - way back you know the very first chapter
191:00 - of calculus limits you're doing limits
191:02 - at infinity
191:02 - you're setting it up so that you're
191:05 - going to do something like a limit of a
191:06 - rational function with equal powers top
191:09 - and bottom to try and get
191:10 - that l that's that's the most typical
191:12 - scenario for this right
191:14 - but you want to think of the bn is
191:16 - always your sort of test sequence that
191:17 - you're trying to compare against
191:19 - um so just as a as a quick example
191:22 - so that didn't take too long let's look
191:25 - at that one that we just left off with
191:27 - right we had
191:31 - this sequence 1 over n squared
191:34 - minus n sorry and started at 2 because
191:36 - we don't want to divide by 0.
191:40 - and you say okay i want to decide on
191:43 - convergence of this series by comparison
191:46 - but we just saw that direct comparison
191:48 - is a pain
191:50 - really a pain okay so we want
191:53 - to compare
191:56 - to what should we compare to well we
191:59 - look at this and again the the
192:01 - the intuition here the idea you want to
192:03 - apply is to say well look
192:05 - for large values of n the highest power
192:08 - is going to dominate
192:09 - ignore all the rest right so it's to
192:11 - throw the rest away and what you're left
192:13 - with is your comparison so we want to
192:14 - compare this
192:16 - with the sum and going from 2 to
192:19 - infinity
192:20 - of 1 over n squared and we know that
192:24 - this
192:24 - is a convergent p
192:27 - series right
192:31 - okay so we're going to compare to this
192:33 - convergent p series
192:34 - and we simply say okay let's look
192:37 - um my a n is 1 over
192:41 - n squared minus n b n is 1 over
192:44 - n squared so
192:48 - limit n going to infinity a n
192:52 - over b n
192:56 - we have the limit n going to infinity
193:00 - of well so dividing by b n dividing by 1
193:03 - over n squared is the same as
193:04 - multiplying by n squared so
193:06 - n squared over n squared minus
193:09 - n okay and
193:13 - that limit is 1 right highest degree top
193:15 - and bottom is
193:16 - equal right power 2 top power 2 bottom
193:20 - we look at the coefficients 1 over 1 we
193:23 - know that limit is
193:24 - 1. okay um and 1 is bigger than 0 it's
193:29 - less than
193:29 - infinity
193:34 - so we know that this sorry
193:38 - going from 2 to infinity n squared minus
193:41 - n converges
193:45 - by the limit comparison test
193:51 - right and you know
193:54 - if you were we had the other example we
193:56 - would do is n squared plus n right so if
193:58 - you had n squared plus n
193:59 - um probably you should do direct
194:01 - comparison you can still do limit
194:03 - comparison this
194:04 - exact same thing is going to work if
194:06 - there was a plus here instead of a minus
194:07 - right
194:08 - you're still going to get one for the
194:09 - limit but this is slightly more work
194:12 - than direct comparison if it's an
194:13 - easy direct comparison right so maybe
194:16 - you want to do direct comparison for
194:17 - plus
194:18 - but you should probably do limit
194:19 - comparison for minus because doing a
194:21 - direct comparison for this we saw that
194:23 - that's actually
194:24 - a fair amount of effort limit comparison
194:27 - is
194:27 - relatively straightforward
194:34 - all right so here's an example applying
194:36 - the limit comparison test
194:38 - we wanted to determine the convergence
194:40 - of this series here
194:41 - we've got one over n plus log n
194:45 - okay now
194:48 - you want to set up a you know you want
194:50 - to set a comparison
194:52 - here and i mean the the nicest direct
194:55 - comparison would be to just drop log n
194:57 - right you drop log n um but then things
195:00 - get bigger right this
195:01 - these terms here are smaller than the
195:03 - harmonic series one over n
195:05 - that tells you nothing because harmonic
195:07 - series diverges and have knowing that
195:08 - your terms are less than a divergent
195:10 - series tells you nothing right
195:12 - you need these to either be bigger than
195:15 - a divergent series or
195:17 - smaller than a convergence series and so
195:20 - you need a little bit of intuition you
195:21 - got to decide off the hop do you think
195:23 - this converges or diverges
195:26 - and then choose
195:29 - your sort of comparator um your the
195:32 - series you want to compare to you choose
195:34 - that wisely all right
195:35 - um it's worth pointing out that you know
195:37 - if you um
195:38 - if you get zero for the limit here and
195:40 - maybe this series diverges
195:42 - um well then then you're you don't
195:45 - really get anywhere right that's a sign
195:47 - that you chose a bad series
195:48 - to compare to right similarly here if
195:51 - you get infinity and this converges
195:54 - you get nothing and it's a sign that you
195:56 - didn't choose very well when you chose
195:58 - that series to compare to
196:00 - okay so here probably you say
196:03 - okay i think
196:10 - i think i'm going to compare this
196:14 - to the harmonic series
196:17 - and going from 1 to infinity of 1
196:21 - over n we know it diverges but
196:25 - again these terms are
196:29 - larger than those right so the
196:31 - comparison direct comparison doesn't go
196:32 - the right way
196:35 - that said
196:38 - we could have done here if you wanted to
196:40 - do direct comparison we might notice
196:42 - this
196:43 - the natural log of n is always smaller
196:45 - than n
196:46 - so this is going to be bigger than or
196:49 - equal
196:50 - to let's make the denominator a little
196:52 - bit bigger makes this thing smaller
196:54 - and plus n which is just 1 over
196:57 - 2n so if you notice that there is a
197:00 - simple direct comparison
197:02 - right this is just half the harmonic
197:04 - series i pull out the one half harmonic
197:05 - series diverges
197:08 - done but maybe you don't notice that
197:11 - right and that's the whole point
197:13 - so we know that this is the harmonic
197:14 - series
197:17 - we know it diverges
197:21 - okay and so maybe you don't make that
197:24 - observation you still want to show that
197:26 - this series diverges you're pretty sure
197:28 - it diverges
197:29 - so we're going to use not direct
197:31 - comparison we're going to do limit
197:32 - comparison
197:33 - okay so a n is 1 over
197:37 - n plus log n
197:40 - b n is 1 over n so our limit
197:44 - looks like this limit and going from
197:48 - n going to infinity again dividing by 1
197:49 - over n is like
197:51 - multiplying by n and over n
197:56 - plus the natural log of n
197:59 - let's use l'hopital's rule shall we use
198:01 - l'hopital's rule let's use l'hopital's
198:02 - rule right
198:03 - it's infinity over infinity
198:09 - derivative of n is 1 i mean think of it
198:11 - as x if you want 1
198:13 - 1 1 over n
198:16 - okay n is going to infinity 1 over n is
198:19 - going to go to 0.
198:21 - again we get 1 for the limit so we're in
198:22 - that first case
198:24 - right the limit is 1 so either both
198:27 - diverge or both converge in this case we
198:29 - know that that one diverges
198:33 - so we know that this
198:37 - series diverges
198:40 - from one to infinity by
198:45 - limit
198:48 - comparison okay and we're done
198:56 - all right here's our next example we're
198:59 - going to determine the conversions of
199:00 - this series here which again has
199:02 - sort of one geometric term and a p
199:04 - series term
199:06 - minus instead of plus we already dealt
199:08 - with the plus sign example that was like
199:09 - our very first example that we did right
199:11 - we said hey we can compare with either
199:12 - the geometric
199:14 - or the p series simple inequality direct
199:17 - comparison
199:18 - done the minus sign makes it a lot
199:20 - harder to set up direct comparison so we
199:22 - say okay how else can we determine the
199:24 - convergence
199:25 - um maybe we try for a limit comparison
199:28 - and now of course if you're going to try
199:30 - for a limit comparison you got to decide
199:31 - what are you going to compare two the
199:33 - geometric part
199:34 - the p series part um
199:37 - probably safer to compare with the
199:38 - geometric part exponential functions
199:40 - grow a lot faster than polynomial
199:42 - functions so the 3 to the n is going to
199:44 - dominate long term
199:46 - so we compare to that right so solution
199:49 - looks like this
199:53 - okay so we have
199:57 - a n is 1 over
200:00 - 3 to the n minus n squared
200:05 - and we want to compare
200:11 - to bn and our bn will be
200:16 - 1 over 3 to the n
200:19 - okay and we should probably point out
200:23 - that this
200:26 - is
200:30 - if we do the corresponding series
200:34 - n equals 1 to infinity 1 over 3 to the n
200:38 - is convergent
200:42 - because it's geometric right it's a
200:45 - convergent geometric series
200:46 - we're good to go all right
200:51 - let's take the limit
200:56 - the limit and going trinity a n
200:59 - over b n again dividing by the
201:02 - reciprocal we multiply
201:05 - by 3 to the n
201:10 - through the n minus n squared once again
201:13 - infinity over infinity if we use
201:16 - l'hopital's rule
201:18 - twice right
201:21 - first time around oh you know what let's
201:24 - just do it
201:27 - because it's an exponential but it's not
201:30 - base e it's base 3 we get 3 to the n
201:34 - log 3 3 to the n
201:38 - log three minus two n
201:41 - okay i mean we should put the little
201:46 - h here let me tell the rule and we're
201:48 - gonna do left hill's rule one more time
201:54 - limit and going to infinity
201:59 - 3 to the n times log
202:02 - 3 now squared don't worry about it it's
202:06 - a constant
202:07 - 3 to the n log
202:11 - 3 squared
202:15 - minus 2 let n go to infinity
202:20 - the minus two doesn't matter right we
202:22 - get one in the limit
202:25 - and usual story
202:28 - maybe i'll i'll skip writing down the
202:30 - answer because i want to tell you one
202:31 - more thing but from here we say okay
202:33 - the limit is one so that's our l l is
202:36 - bigger than zero it's less than infinity
202:39 - we know that this series converges now
202:41 - we know that this series converges by
202:43 - limited comparison
202:45 - now you might have been wondering what
202:46 - if you what have you kind of like i
202:49 - don't know you messed up it's not really
202:50 - messed up but
202:51 - maybe you decided to compare with n
202:53 - squared instead right what if you did
202:55 - if you did bn
202:58 - equals 1 over n squared you say hey
203:00 - that's that gives me a convergent p
203:02 - series
203:04 - what would i get then well if i did that
203:06 - then a
203:07 - n over b n
203:11 - i would get instead i would get n
203:12 - squared
203:14 - over 3 to the n minus n squared
203:18 - and we try to take the limit and again
203:21 - you can use l'hopital's rule a couple of
203:23 - times and you find that this
203:25 - is going to go to zero
203:29 - as n goes to infinity um
203:32 - right we don't get a finite value we get
203:35 - zero
203:36 - so did limit comparison did it fail
203:39 - not exactly puts us in case two
203:43 - limit is zero the bn
203:46 - series converges right it's a convergent
203:49 - p
203:49 - series so we know the ans converge as
203:51 - well
203:53 - okay either way it works that's the nice
203:56 - thing about limit comparison there's
203:58 - a fair amount of wiggle room there's
203:59 - cushion built in right it's not
204:01 - quite as sensitive to small mistakes one
204:04 - way or the other limit comparison is
204:06 - sort of a blunt instrument it gets the
204:08 - job done
204:14 - okay so here's our last example using
204:16 - limit comparison
204:18 - it's the last example for this section
204:19 - on limit and comparison tests
204:22 - we want to determine the convergence of
204:24 - this series here right and now
204:26 - um the point that we've tried to drive
204:28 - home with the
204:29 - the examples we've done so far is it
204:31 - limit comparison right it's sort of a
204:33 - blunt instrument it's not particularly
204:37 - sensitive to the small details right we
204:40 - we only really care about sort of
204:41 - largest powers and so here
204:43 - if we're thinking about long run
204:45 - behavior we say what's going to dominate
204:47 - when n is big
204:48 - adding 3 is not going to matter neither
204:50 - is adding 1.
204:51 - neither is subtracting n when you're
204:53 - comparing to n squared right it's just
204:55 - this root n over n squared this stuff
204:57 - here
204:58 - this is the part that matters for large
205:03 - n okay and so we
205:06 - say let's compare
205:14 - so we want to compare a n which is root
205:16 - n
205:17 - plus 3 over n squared minus n plus 1
205:21 - to b n which will be
205:24 - root n over n squared
205:28 - which is so that's n to the one half
205:32 - n squared right so 2 minus a half is one
205:35 - over n
205:36 - to the three over two okay
205:41 - okay so let's look the limit
205:46 - as n goes to infinity and over
205:49 - b n is going to be the limit
205:54 - n goes to infinity so let's put a n in
205:56 - there
205:57 - root n plus 3 n squared
206:01 - minus n plus 1. and we're dividing by bn
206:05 - which means multiplying by
206:09 - n to the three over two okay
206:13 - so if we multiply that through
206:16 - we get the limit n going to infinity of
206:20 - n squared plus 3 n
206:23 - to the 3 over 2 divided by
206:27 - n squared minus n plus 1.
206:31 - and that limit is one
206:35 - using the typical argument that we just
206:36 - have to look at the largest powers
206:39 - ratio of the coefficients when those
206:40 - largest powers are equal right
206:42 - okay so that limit is one we're in the
206:45 - first case
206:47 - and now we say oh what do we know about
206:49 - the bns um
206:54 - this series n going from one to infinity
206:57 - and one over oops sorry
207:02 - n to the 3 over 2 does it converge or
207:06 - diverge it converges
207:09 - right it's a p series
207:14 - p is equal to three over two which is
207:16 - bigger than one
207:18 - we know that our original series
207:23 - root n plus three n squared minus n
207:27 - plus one it must also converge
207:33 - using the limit comparison test
207:37 - okay that's it but again
207:40 - the point is that you do not want to be
207:43 - handling something like that by direct
207:45 - comparison right
207:46 - limit comparison gives you a
207:48 - straightforward way of
207:50 - setting up a comparison letting you
207:53 - compare a complicated series
207:55 - with a simple one where we have a known
207:57 - result and
207:58 - all it's going to cost you is a limit at
208:00 - infinity
208:02 - using techniques that you learned in
208:03 - calc 1.
208:09 - all right so our next topic is the ratio
208:11 - test
208:12 - so the ratio test is stated here is a
208:14 - theorem
208:15 - again the assumption is that we're
208:16 - dealing with a positive sequence so
208:20 - our series is summing positive terms we
208:22 - aren't alternating signs at all
208:25 - and the ratio test gives you a simple
208:28 - thing to consider
208:29 - it says just look at the ratio of
208:30 - consecutive terms in your sequence
208:32 - a n plus 1 over a n if that limit comes
208:36 - out to a value which is less than one
208:39 - you know your sequence converges if it's
208:41 - bigger than one
208:42 - the series diverges sorry i said
208:44 - sequence meant series
208:46 - so series converges if l is less than
208:48 - one diverges if l is bigger than one
208:51 - and if you actually get one on the nose
208:53 - then the ratio test fails right
208:55 - so the test tells you nothing if that
208:57 - limit happens to be equal to one
208:59 - um so one of the things that's kind of
209:01 - important now that we're sort of
209:03 - building up our arsenal of tests right
209:05 - we have geometric series now we have p
209:07 - series telescoping series i mean there's
209:09 - not really a test there you just have to
209:10 - recognize it as telescoping
209:13 - we have the integral test we have
209:14 - comparison test limit comparison now
209:16 - ratio
209:16 - soon root right um
209:20 - solving problems involving sequences in
209:21 - series is all about choosing the right
209:23 - tool for the job
209:25 - and it's about doing enough problems
209:27 - that you're able to recognize
209:29 - what the right tool is going to be okay
209:32 - so for example
209:35 - the ratio test is not the right tool for
209:38 - a p series right
209:39 - if you think about a p series
209:46 - right if my a n
209:49 - is is 1 over n to the p
209:53 - right and if i was looking at well what
209:55 - do i get for a
209:56 - n plus 1 over a n
210:00 - well i'm going to get
210:03 - n over n plus 1 to the p
210:06 - after a bit of simplifying right
210:10 - and that's going to go to 1 in the limit
210:13 - right
210:15 - so the ratio test is useless for p
210:17 - series but that's okay because we
210:19 - already know how to handle p
210:20 - series right we just have to look at
210:21 - that value of p is it bigger than one or
210:23 - is it less than one
210:24 - right um so the ratio test is not
210:26 - helpful for p series but it is helpful
210:28 - for a lot of other series
210:30 - in particular ratio test definitely
210:33 - takes care of geometric series
210:35 - right
210:39 - think about a geometric series if
210:43 - n looks like r to the n
210:47 - right well then a n plus 1
210:52 - over a n is going to be
210:57 - r to the n plus one over r to the n
211:01 - which is r um and as we already know
211:06 - geometric series converges precisely
211:09 - for for positive r converges precisely
211:11 - when r is less than one
211:13 - okay we can see that again with the
211:16 - ratio test
211:17 - in fact the way you actually understand
211:19 - why the ratio test works the way you
211:21 - would prove it
211:22 - is is using something that is sort of
211:25 - based on the geometric series test it's
211:27 - realizing that okay
211:29 - you know what is what are we really
211:33 - saying
211:33 - when we say that the limit as n goes to
211:36 - infinity
211:37 - of a n plus 1 over a n
211:41 - is equal to l well
211:45 - this sort of means
211:50 - that you know a n plus 1
211:54 - is approximately a n times
211:57 - l for
212:02 - large n right
212:07 - and if you think about well okay
212:10 - so this is i mean this is not a proof by
212:12 - any means but just think of it this way
212:14 - so so a n plus 1 is
212:15 - just l times a n right and then
212:19 - a n plus 2 would be l times a n plus 1
212:21 - would be l
212:22 - times l times a n and you can sort of
212:25 - you know get from here to say well that
212:27 - means that you know
212:27 - a n plus k
212:31 - is like a n times
212:35 - l to the k right
212:39 - and so then you sort of think about what
212:40 - happens as k gets really large and you
212:42 - say well this is more or less behaving
212:44 - like a geometric series right it's not
212:46 - exactly a geometric series because
212:49 - you know this is only an approximation
212:50 - it's not exact
212:52 - but with the definition of the limit
212:55 - right if you bring in you know the
212:56 - epsilon definition of the limit we can
212:58 - say for
212:58 - a large enough n we can make the
213:00 - difference between this ratio and l
213:03 - less than epsilon we can work out what
213:04 - that means and we can
213:06 - make this precise right so this is one
213:08 - way to think about why the ratio test
213:10 - works
213:11 - it's essentially taking much more
213:13 - general series
213:15 - and in a sense comparing them to a
213:18 - geometric series right
213:20 - but using the machinery of a limit to
213:22 - set up that comparison
213:24 - okay so that's one way to understand why
213:27 - it works
213:28 - certainly not a proof but it gives you
213:29 - some idea of the concept
213:32 - with that under our belts we'll move on
213:33 - and we'll look at some examples
213:40 - all right so here's our first example
213:41 - with the ratio test
213:44 - three series one two three i put three
213:46 - over here
213:47 - short on space um we want to
213:51 - see if we can use the ratio test to
213:52 - determine convergence of these series
213:55 - now the ratio test tends to work really
213:57 - well
213:58 - for things like powers and factorials
214:01 - right
214:01 - um you know exponential so we mentioned
214:04 - that you know the ratio test is
214:05 - sort of closely related to geometric
214:07 - series
214:08 - so when you see exponential functions
214:11 - you expect that the the ratio test is
214:13 - probably going to be
214:14 - good for for factorials the reason why
214:18 - the ratio test works really well for
214:19 - factorials
214:20 - is you might recall that the factorial
214:23 - can be defined sort of recursively right
214:25 - n plus 1 factorial
214:28 - can be written as n plus 1
214:31 - times n factorial
214:35 - that observation frequently comes in
214:37 - handy because in this case we would say
214:39 - that
214:40 - our a n okay a n is 2 to the n
214:44 - over n factorial and so we want to set
214:48 - up this ratio
214:50 - a n plus 1 over a n
214:53 - so that's going to look like 2 to the n
214:56 - plus 1
214:58 - over n plus 1 factorial
215:02 - divide by a n we just multiply by the
215:04 - reciprocal okay
215:06 - n factorial over 2 to the n
215:10 - right and now we can see that there's
215:14 - there's some cancellation that goes on
215:16 - right 2 to the n plus 1 of course we can
215:20 - might as well why not mention that one
215:21 - two though i think everyone knows this
215:24 - 2 to the n plus 1 we can always write as
215:27 - 2
215:28 - times 2 to the n right laws of exponents
215:31 - n plus 1 so 2 to the n times 2 to the 1.
215:34 - there we go and so we see that actually
215:37 - quite a bit cancels here
215:39 - 2 to the n is going to cancel with all
215:42 - but one of those twos
215:43 - the n factorial cancels with
215:47 - well the factorial if you like right
215:50 - this
215:50 - n plus 1 factorial is n plus 1 times n
215:53 - plus
215:53 - n factorial cancel the factorials
215:56 - and we see that the limit
216:00 - as n goes to infinity of n plus 1
216:04 - over a n well it turns out once you
216:08 - simplify that's just the limit of
216:11 - two over n plus one
216:16 - and that limit is zero
216:20 - zero is definitely less than one
216:23 - and so our conclusion here
216:26 - is that the series
216:32 - converges okay
216:35 - so far so good moving on to the next one
216:39 - now for this next one
216:43 - there there are ways to answer this
216:45 - without maybe even applying a test
216:47 - depending on
216:48 - how comfortable you are with the sort of
216:51 - long-term behavior of various
216:52 - different types of functions right one
216:55 - of the things that you might have
216:56 - encountered if you've been playing
216:57 - around with these things is that
216:59 - factorials grow much faster than
217:00 - exponential functions right
217:02 - because two to the n every time you mult
217:04 - you know increase
217:05 - n by one you're multiplying by two up
217:07 - here but down here you're multiplying by
217:09 - one larger right
217:10 - first you're multiplying by two over two
217:12 - then two over three then two over four
217:14 - then two over five right so this this
217:16 - is getting bigger on the bottom right
217:19 - exponential functions in turn they grow
217:21 - much faster than power functions and
217:23 - power polynomials in general right so we
217:26 - expect that actually here the numerator
217:28 - is growing faster than the denominator
217:30 - and you could just apply this sort of
217:33 - basic test for divergence right you
217:35 - could say well look at
217:36 - a n here is 3 to the n
217:40 - over n cubed and
217:44 - you could say hey look the um the limit
217:48 - as this the limit of a n as n goes to
217:51 - infinity the limit of this thing
217:52 - it's it's actually infinite because it's
217:56 - infinity over infinity but use
217:57 - l'hopital's rule three times
217:59 - you're just left with six on the bottom
218:00 - you'll still have three to the n on top
218:02 - it's going to go to infinity right um so
218:06 - so this series here fails that most
218:08 - basic test for divergence
218:11 - right which says that the only you know
218:13 - if the terms in your sequence
218:16 - that you're summing right if the ans if
218:18 - they don't go to zero
218:20 - you know that your series diverges um so
218:24 - this is enough of an observation to
218:25 - point out that the series has to diverge
218:27 - okay because it goes to infinity of
218:29 - course you could also you know
218:31 - we're supposed to be practicing the
218:32 - ratio test right so we could also see
218:35 - this from the ratio test if we look at
218:37 - well what is
218:37 - a n plus 1 over a n
218:40 - so this is my a n here
218:44 - and so if i put n plus 1 in there
218:48 - i get 3 to the n plus 1
218:51 - n plus 1 cubed times
218:55 - so 1 over a n will be n cubed over
218:58 - over 3 to the n okay
219:02 - so that's going to give me
219:06 - 3 times n cubed
219:11 - over n plus 1 cubed and
219:14 - in the limit that's going to go to 1 1
219:17 - times 3 goes to 3
219:19 - 3 is bigger than 1 so ratio test says it
219:22 - diverges
219:23 - right okay so we can do that
219:27 - what about this one here now this is
219:29 - very similar to the p
219:30 - series we talked about in the last video
219:32 - we said ratio test is useless for this
219:35 - and you can go ahead and you can check
219:36 - the ratio test is useless
219:38 - if you try to apply the ratio test
219:41 - you're going to get a rational function
219:42 - and it's going to have the same power
219:44 - top and bottom it's going to be n
219:45 - squared the limit is going to be 1
219:47 - ratio test fails but we don't need the
219:51 - ratio test for this
219:52 - we know that this converges this
219:54 - converges
219:58 - by comparison right it converges by
220:02 - comparison
220:06 - with the p series 1 over n
220:09 - squared because 1 over n squared plus 1
220:12 - is
220:12 - slightly smaller than 1 over n squared
220:15 - right
220:15 - so the ratio test is not always the
220:18 - right tool for the job
220:20 - even here even something like this where
220:21 - it really looks like
220:23 - you know it's the right sort of you know
220:24 - ratio test loves power function
220:26 - loves not power functions but
220:27 - exponential functions um
220:30 - it's the sort of form that works for a
220:32 - ratio test and yes you can use rescue
220:34 - tests but
220:36 - maybe you don't need to right as as you
220:39 - move through tests of sort of higher and
220:41 - higher degrees of sophistication
220:44 - sometimes you forget that you can come
220:45 - back to these very simple rules that we
220:47 - started out with
220:48 - they can also do the job for you
220:55 - all right so here's a more challenging
220:57 - example
220:58 - we've got a lot of factorials in there
221:00 - ratio test is the right tool for the job
221:02 - when you see factorials
221:04 - frequently is at least um but i mean
221:07 - n factorial you know we've got the
221:09 - square
221:10 - of n factorial on the top on the bottom
221:13 - now be careful that's not just twice n
221:14 - factorial right if
221:16 - it was just 2 times n factorial we'd
221:17 - cancel we'd simplify
221:19 - a piece of cake no this means we we
221:21 - double n and then we take the factorial
221:23 - right um so 2n factorial is is way way
221:27 - way bigger
221:28 - than n factorial right is it bigger than
221:30 - n factorial squared
221:32 - um yeah of course because here you
221:35 - multiply by the first n integers and
221:37 - then you multiply by the first n
221:38 - integers again
221:39 - down here you multiply by the first n
221:41 - integers and then you multiply by the
221:43 - next
221:43 - n integers it's a lot bigger
221:46 - okay so the denominator is definitely
221:49 - larger than the numerator
221:51 - seems like maybe it's going to work out
221:53 - for us
221:54 - but let's let's apply the ratio test and
221:56 - be sure
221:58 - okay so let's see a n in this case
222:02 - is n factorial n factorial
222:07 - 2 n factorial and so let's
222:10 - look what do we get when we do
222:14 - a n plus 1 over
222:17 - a n so we have
222:20 - n plus 1 factorial n
222:23 - plus 1 factorial over
222:29 - 2 so do it this way 2 times
222:32 - n plus 1 factorial that's going to be 2n
222:35 - plus 2
222:36 - factorial on the bottom right okay
222:40 - multiply by 1 over a n so we flip this
222:42 - thing over
222:44 - 2n factorial
222:47 - n factorial n factorial
222:50 - okay so
222:54 - remember now that n plus one factorial
222:56 - we can write as n plus one
222:58 - times n factorial we do that twice so n
223:01 - plus one squared
223:03 - n factorial squared on the bottom
223:07 - this is two n plus two so it's
223:10 - two n plus two times two n plus one
223:14 - times two n factorial okay
223:19 - then we have 2n factorial
223:23 - n factorial squared if we want to write
223:26 - it like that
223:28 - and now we look for cancellations and
223:29 - there are a lot of them
223:32 - those cancel that cancels
223:36 - okay and we're just left with
223:41 - n plus 1 squared
223:44 - over 2n plus 2
223:47 - times two n plus one um
223:51 - you can probably see how that's going to
223:52 - go but maybe just to
223:55 - make things crystal clear let's multiply
223:58 - these things out
224:00 - okay four n squared
224:03 - plus two n plus four n
224:07 - six n plus two
224:10 - okay so what's the limit
224:17 - the limit as n goes to infinity
224:21 - of a n plus one over a n
224:25 - well it's one over four
224:29 - all right it's a rational function top
224:31 - degree is n squared top and bottom
224:34 - and 1 over 4 is
224:37 - less than 1 and that means that
224:42 - the series converges
224:48 - by the ratio test
224:52 - there we go
224:58 - all right so next up is the root test
225:02 - root test looks an awful lot like the
225:04 - ratio test
225:06 - in fact all i had to do is come through
225:07 - and change a few pieces here right
225:09 - so in the root test it's called the root
225:11 - test because you look at the nth root of
225:13 - a n right as n goes to infinity so both
225:16 - the
225:17 - the degree of the root goes up as n
225:20 - increases right so another way to write
225:22 - that usually more convenient is to write
225:24 - that as a
225:25 - n to the power 1 over n right so we're
225:28 - looking at increa
225:29 - fractional powers with increasingly
225:31 - large denominator
225:32 - okay and we're letting n go to infinity
225:35 - here
225:37 - now it looks a lot like the ratio test
225:39 - and with good reason this is yet another
225:41 - variation on the theme of geometric
225:43 - series right
225:44 - notice that
225:47 - if a n
225:53 - is r to the n
225:56 - well then a n
226:00 - to the one over n is
226:03 - r to the n to the one over n
226:08 - which is just r right and we know that a
226:11 - geometric series is going to converge
226:13 - for r less than one it's going to
226:14 - diverge for or bigger than one
226:16 - of course if it's a geometric series on
226:18 - the nose we also know it diverges for r
226:20 - equal to one
226:22 - but it's not exactly a geometric series
226:24 - here so we can't
226:25 - really say anything if our you know if
226:27 - this limit is equal to one
226:28 - right um so
226:32 - the idea here is that well if
226:35 - if a n to the one over
226:38 - n right um
226:42 - if n is large
226:46 - sufficiently large right a n to the 1
226:49 - over
226:50 - n is approximately equal to the limit l
226:52 - whatever it has
226:53 - happens to be and that suggests that
226:57 - a n
227:00 - something you know it goes something
227:01 - like l to the n so it really
227:04 - is again trying to take whatever series
227:06 - you have
227:08 - and approximate it by a geometric series
227:10 - and then use what we know about
227:11 - geometric series to decide on
227:13 - convergence at the limit
227:14 - that's the strategy here okay and again
227:17 - it's not
227:18 - on the nose it's only approximate but it
227:19 - gives you an idea of what's going on
227:22 - one reminder
227:29 - for positive constants if you think
227:33 - about taking roots of constants um
227:36 - for numbers that are between zero and
227:38 - one if you take the root of a number
227:39 - between zero and one it actually gets a
227:41 - little bit bigger right like square root
227:42 - of a quarter is a half
227:44 - take the square root of a number that's
227:46 - bigger than one it gets smaller
227:49 - um so for a positive constant if you
227:51 - take
227:53 - that constant to the power one over n
227:56 - and ask where it goes it goes to 1
228:01 - as n goes to infinity that's often a
228:05 - useful observation to make of course you
228:06 - can show that using
228:07 - calculus if you like but we'll just make
228:10 - that as an observation in case it comes
228:12 - up in
228:12 - some of the following examples
228:19 - all right so we'll end this section by
228:20 - looking at a few examples that apply the
228:23 - root test
228:23 - to determine convergence now one of the
228:27 - things you'll probably find as you're
228:28 - working through problems is that
228:30 - you don't use the root test nearly as
228:32 - often as you use the ratio test
228:34 - right 19 times out of 20 you probably go
228:36 - for the ratio test over the root test
228:39 - um but there are scenarios where the
228:41 - root test is much more effective
228:44 - here's one i think where it's probably
228:47 - clear that it's easy to use the root
228:48 - test because
228:50 - and well a
228:53 - n is three
228:56 - n plus one
229:00 - over five n minus two
229:05 - to the power of n and if we wanna now
229:08 - take that and raise it to the power
229:13 - 1 over n
229:18 - right well
229:22 - those two exponents they cancel each
229:24 - other out right nth power nth root those
229:27 - cancel we just get three
229:28 - n plus one over
229:31 - five n minus two
229:35 - well that means that
229:40 - the limit as n goes to infinity
229:43 - of a n to the one over n
229:47 - well this is rational same power top and
229:51 - bottom
229:52 - we look at the coefficients the limit is
229:54 - three over five
229:56 - three over five is less than one and
229:59 - that means the
230:02 - series converges
230:06 - okay that works out for us
230:10 - now you could probably also do this
230:12 - using you could try using the ratio test
230:14 - i think you would find that
230:16 - ratio test will also work for you
230:19 - root test just happens to be cleaner in
230:21 - this particular case
230:22 - okay if we look at the next one
230:28 - a n we have
230:32 - n to the fourth over log n
230:36 - to the nth power so again we're going to
230:39 - raise that
230:40 - to the power 1 over n
230:44 - okay and what we get
230:48 - is we get n to the 4 oops sorry
230:53 - 1 over n let's be careful here
230:56 - we get n to the 4 over n on top
231:01 - we get the natural log of n on the
231:03 - bottom
231:04 - uh now one of the results that actually
231:07 - um i mentioned this before
231:08 - if you have a constant to the one over n
231:11 - you let n go into infinity that's
231:12 - typically going to go to one
231:14 - okay that's
231:17 - kind of clear right i mean if n goes to
231:19 - infinity 1 over n is going to go to 0
231:22 - constant raised to the power of 0 should
231:23 - give you 1. it's actually also true
231:26 - though
231:28 - that
231:31 - if you take n to the power 1 over n
231:34 - that will also go to 1
231:39 - as n goes to infinity
231:42 - and n to the four over n will just be
231:45 - well
231:46 - n to the one over n raised to the fourth
231:48 - power one to the fourth power
231:49 - still one okay um so if you take the
231:53 - limit of this one
231:59 - as n goes to infinity
232:03 - so we have n to the 4 over
232:06 - n divided by log n
232:10 - well this limit is going to be zero okay
232:13 - because the top is approaching one
232:19 - the bottom goes to infinity one over
232:22 - infinity gives you
232:24 - gives you zero right um if you want to
232:26 - go into detail on this you can
232:28 - play around with indeterminate forms
232:30 - l'hopital's rule
232:31 - um i mean the whole thing is not even
232:34 - indeterminate right one over infinity is
232:36 - not indeterminate we get zero
232:39 - the main thing is making sure that you
232:40 - can see that that top is actually going
232:42 - to one
232:45 - if this isn't clear to you remember you
232:46 - can always rewrite
232:48 - let me just put this as an aside you can
232:51 - always say hey you know what
232:52 - n to the 4 over n i can write
232:55 - as e to the log
232:58 - of n to the 4 over n but then the 4 over
233:02 - n comes down
233:04 - you get that right and if you let n go
233:07 - to infinity log n over n goes to zero e
233:09 - to the zero is one
233:11 - that's where the one comes from okay
233:15 - coming to the last one let's try the
233:18 - last one
233:19 - um a n
233:23 - to the 1 over n is going to be
233:26 - 2 to the n to the 1 over n
233:29 - divided by n squared to the 1 over n
233:34 - so we get 2 over
233:38 - n to the 2 over n and using the same
233:42 - reasoning as here this is going to go to
233:43 - 1
233:44 - that's just a 2. that goes to 2
233:47 - 2 is bigger than 1. right
233:50 - probably forgot to mention in this case
233:51 - here right
233:53 - limit is 0 well 0 is less than 1.
233:56 - so that second series also converges the
233:58 - third one diverges right
234:00 - we get 2 for the limit 2 is bigger than
234:02 - 1 root test says
234:04 - it says it diverges and by the way
234:07 - for that third one you probably in
234:09 - practice don't use the root test
234:12 - test for divergence the simple test for
234:14 - divergence tells you already that this
234:16 - series has to diverge because if you
234:18 - take the limit of just the sequence
234:21 - as n goes to infinity already you get
234:23 - infinity right 2 to the n grows a lot
234:24 - faster than n squared
234:26 - the terms don't go to zero end of story
234:29 - you could also do the ratio test ratio
234:31 - test would be easy to apply here
234:33 - but the root test also gets the job done
234:41 - all right so the next topic we want to
234:43 - look at is alternating series
234:46 - so the definition is here an alternating
234:50 - series
234:51 - is a series of one of the following
234:54 - forms so we have
234:56 - these a n's are still kind of positive
234:58 - so you still start with a positive
234:59 - sequence like usual
235:01 - um but you put this sign factor in front
235:04 - right so minus 1 to the n
235:06 - right that alternates sign if it's if n
235:08 - is even this is plus 1 if n is odd
235:10 - that's minus 1
235:11 - swaps back and forth in sine so this is
235:14 - how you
235:15 - you see the terms right so this is going
235:17 - to be you know this would be like
235:18 - minus a1 plus a2
235:22 - minus a3 plus a4
235:26 - and so on right so the sign changes um
235:29 - if you want the first term to be
235:30 - positive then you do minus one to the n
235:32 - plus one
235:32 - right so either way we consider it an
235:35 - alternating series
235:36 - whether the first term is positive or
235:37 - negative doesn't matter
235:39 - what matters is that the sign alternates
235:40 - between positive and negative
235:42 - okay now the surprising thing is that
235:45 - for alternating series right
235:47 - we we know that this condition here
235:51 - on its own this condition is not
235:54 - sufficient for convergence right
235:56 - we've seen this we've seen that
236:01 - the series sum of n going from one to
236:04 - infinity
236:06 - one over n this diverges
236:11 - all right this is the harmonic series
236:13 - okay harmonic series diverges
236:15 - the p series with p is equal to one
236:17 - there are other ways to prove it but
236:18 - this
236:18 - you know integral test does it but there
236:21 - are direct proofs as well
236:22 - that is a divergent series despite the
236:25 - fact that the terms go to zero
236:26 - okay but nonetheless if we have
236:30 - a sequence where the ans are positive
236:32 - right so this
236:33 - uh oh let's be careful hahaha
236:38 - i forgot the minus one
236:42 - all right hope you weren't watching the
236:43 - video and turn it off
236:45 - before we got to that correction okay
236:49 - we need the minus one to the n in there
236:51 - minus 1 to the n times a n it needs to
236:52 - be an alternating series right
236:54 - so the a n's are positive so that this
236:56 - becomes alternating
236:58 - for an alternating series as long as
237:01 - the ends are positive and they're
237:03 - decreasing
237:04 - then it turns out it is good enough to
237:06 - have the ans go to zero right
237:09 - so this harmonic series diverges but the
237:13 - alternating harmonic series
237:17 - and going from one to infinity
237:20 - minus 1 to the n plus 1 over n
237:26 - that converges right happens to converge
237:29 - in fact to the natural log of 2
237:31 - if you can believe it right so
237:35 - we'll we'll encounter this a number of
237:37 - times right where
237:40 - the alternating series will converge but
237:43 - the corresponding
237:45 - non-alternating series if you drop the
237:47 - sine factor and you just look at the sum
237:48 - of the a n's without the minus 1 to the
237:50 - n in front
237:52 - right whether that minus 1 to the n that
237:54 - series may very well diverge but you
237:56 - simply put this alternating sign in
237:58 - there and suddenly the series converges
238:00 - which is kind of interesting and the
238:03 - idea is that
238:05 - you sort of if you're looking at the
238:07 - partial sums you sort of you know you
238:08 - start with
238:10 - let's say a1 is positive right so you
238:12 - start it like here's zero
238:14 - right and and you add a one so
238:18 - you're kind of out here here's a1
238:21 - right and now you subtract a2
238:25 - but when you subtract a2 you know you
238:28 - get to
238:29 - a2 is less than a1 so we don't make it
238:30 - all the way back to here maybe we make
238:32 - it to here
238:33 - right and there's a1 minus a2
238:37 - and then we add on a3 so
238:40 - we get a bit bigger all right
238:44 - um a1 minus a2
238:48 - plus a3 right i mean maybe we go even
238:51 - further
238:52 - but you know a3 is less than a2 so we
238:55 - don't make it past where we were before
238:57 - right we make it
238:58 - out to there or maybe up to there and
238:59 - then we subtract
239:01 - and we get a bit smaller and so you kind
239:03 - of you're moving back and forth back and
239:05 - forth but
239:06 - the amount that you're adding or
239:07 - subtracting
239:09 - is getting smaller every time right
239:12 - and so if you look at the partial sums
239:16 - when n is odd in this scenario here the
239:19 - partial sub n is odd
239:20 - you know they start big but they get
239:22 - smaller so you have a
239:23 - you have a decreasing sequence that's
239:26 - bounded below
239:28 - by zero right and if you look at the
239:31 - even terms you have an
239:32 - increasing sequence that's bounded above
239:35 - say by a1
239:36 - right so you've got two bounded monotone
239:39 - sequences you know that they have to
239:40 - converge
239:41 - and the main thing is showing that they
239:43 - converge to the same limit
239:45 - um once you've established that you get
239:48 - this theorem
239:49 - okay so we'll look at a few examples
239:52 - we'll see how the alternating series
239:53 - test applies
239:54 - and then when we come back to this
239:56 - question of you know
239:57 - convergence of the alternating series
239:59 - versus the corresponding non-alternating
240:01 - series this gets us to absolute
240:03 - convergence absolute convergences
240:05 - well what happens if you take the
240:06 - absolute value drop the minus sign
240:08 - do you still have convergence or not
240:10 - right
240:11 - that's going to be an important question
240:15 - the other thing that we we don't have
240:17 - time to talk is an interesting thing but
240:19 - it's beyond the scope of a calculus
240:20 - curse
240:22 - turns out that in cases where the
240:24 - alternating series converges but the
240:27 - non-alternating series doesn't this is
240:29 - referred to as conditional convergence
240:31 - um and it turns out that conditional
240:32 - convergence is sort of a it's a fragile
240:35 - thing
240:36 - it depends on the order in which you
240:38 - write down the terms which is kind of an
240:40 - odd thing to think about but it sort of
240:42 - comes to playing around with you know if
240:44 - you added a whole bunch of the positive
240:45 - terms
240:46 - and then some of the negative and then a
240:48 - bunch more the positive and then some of
240:49 - the negative
240:50 - ones um there's a surprising thing it's
240:52 - an interesting theorem
240:54 - that one can prove it's a very difficult
240:56 - theorem but it can be done
240:59 - once you have an alternating series you
241:02 - can rearrange the order in which the
241:03 - terms appear
241:05 - to get any real number you want
241:09 - which is bizarre right for
241:12 - for a term for a series with only
241:14 - positive terms
241:15 - you get a limit and that limit is unique
241:17 - there's only one possible value but for
241:18 - alternating series
241:20 - just changing the order around gets you
241:23 - different answers it's bizarre it's a
241:25 - strange thing
241:27 - beyond beyond what we can talk about in
241:28 - a calculus course but if you go on and
241:30 - you take a course in let's say real
241:31 - analysis
241:33 - you might get to play with some of these
241:34 - ideas
241:40 - all right so here are three series we
241:42 - want to know whether the alternating
241:43 - series test
241:45 - sometimes abbreviate ast now we want to
241:47 - know if it can be applied
241:49 - the first one is the one we just talked
241:51 - about it's the alternating harmonic
241:52 - series
241:53 - right the underlying sequence if we
241:56 - ignore the minus 1 to the n plus 1 is
241:58 - just
241:59 - a n is is one over n and
242:02 - so let's see this is
242:06 - is positive
242:09 - it's decreasing
242:15 - and we also know that the limit as n
242:17 - goes to infinity
242:19 - of a n is zero right
242:22 - so we check those three boxes right um
242:26 - and this is the interesting thing about
242:27 - alternating series tests you are just
242:30 - checking boxes right it's it's there's
242:32 - hypotheses there's a conclusion right
242:35 - so there are three things in the
242:36 - hypothesis sequence is positive
242:38 - sequence is decreasing sequence has zero
242:41 - for the limit
242:42 - if you can check those three boxes your
242:45 - sequence
242:46 - converges okay
242:49 - so that's it we know it converges um as
242:52 - i mentioned
242:53 - later on we'll see that it converges to
242:54 - natural log of 2 but
242:56 - for now we know at least that it
242:57 - converges okay
243:00 - what about this next one well
243:04 - we've got the appropriate form right
243:06 - we've got the minus 1 to the n
243:09 - log n over n so a n is
243:13 - log n over n um
243:17 - so let's see we need to check
243:22 - positive we need to check decreasing
243:28 - and we need to check the limit
243:35 - all right so let's have a look
243:39 - is it a positive sequence um
243:42 - well okay log of one is zero so the
243:44 - first term is zero but after that we're
243:46 - fine
243:48 - so let's say positive sometimes we allow
243:49 - zero for positive it's at least
243:51 - non-negative
243:52 - what about decreasing if you try the
243:55 - first couple values of n
243:57 - you might find that it's going up right
244:00 - so then you get a little bit worried
244:01 - you're like oh it's not decreasing it
244:03 - looks like the values are going up
244:05 - can't apply the alternating series test
244:07 - on the other hand
244:11 - the limit is zero
244:14 - right simple application of l'hopital's
244:17 - rule will tell you that
244:18 - it's infinity over infinity as n goes to
244:20 - infinity take the derivative of the top
244:22 - you get one over n
244:23 - bottom is just one that limit goes to
244:26 - zero
244:28 - check but it doesn't seem to be
244:30 - decreasing so you worry that you can't
244:32 - apply the alternating series test but
244:34 - let's let's take a look at
244:35 - if you take a look at the function right
244:37 - you look at f of x
244:41 - if f x is log x over x
244:45 - then f prime of x if we do the quotient
244:48 - rule we get the derivative of the top 1
244:50 - over x times the bottom
244:51 - x 1 over x times x is 1
244:54 - minus top times the derivative of the
244:57 - bottom
244:58 - just log x bottom squared
245:03 - well that's going to be less than zero
245:08 - for log x bigger than
245:12 - one which is the same thing as saying
245:15 - that
245:16 - x has to be bigger than well e
245:19 - is not an integer but um it'll work for
245:22 - three
245:22 - right um so it's decreasing
245:28 - for n bigger than or equal to 3
245:32 - and that's good enough right
245:35 - nobody cares about the first couple
245:37 - terms right if you're deciding on
245:38 - convergence the first couple terms is
245:40 - not going to change whether or not the
245:42 - series converges you just drop them
245:44 - off the end figure out the rest
245:47 - works out as long as it's eventually
245:48 - decreasing you're fine okay
245:51 - so that works but then we come to this
245:53 - last one we've got sine of
245:54 - n over n squared okay
245:58 - the absolute value make sure that things
245:59 - are positive so we've got that again
246:02 - definitely the limit is zero right
246:04 - because this is bounded and n squared is
246:06 - going to go to infinity
246:10 - but it's not decreasing okay the terms
246:12 - are not decreasing
246:13 - because sine of n is going to oscillate
246:17 - between 0 and 1. it's going to take
246:19 - values between 0 and 1 and it's going to
246:20 - keep doing that forever right as n goes
246:22 - off to infinity
246:24 - there are going to be values that are
246:25 - close to one they're going to be values
246:27 - that are close to zero
246:28 - right um so yeah it's bouncing around on
246:32 - us it's not
246:33 - it's not strictly decreasing and there's
246:35 - no way to make it strictly decreasing
246:37 - so in this case um we're out of luck
246:40 - maybe it still converges in fact
246:44 - it does we'll see soon that uh
246:48 - if the c cons if the series converges
246:50 - without the minus one to the n in there
246:53 - this will be called absolute convergence
246:54 - if you can show it converges without
246:56 - that term
246:58 - then it converges with if you put that
246:59 - term in okay
247:01 - so it does converge um and it converges
247:05 - just by comparison with the p
247:07 - series right 1 over n squared so it
247:09 - converges
247:10 - but you can't establish that convergence
247:13 - using the alternating series test you
247:15 - need to use a different theorem
247:16 - to show that it converges
247:23 - all right so the next result we want to
247:24 - talk about is the approximation theorem
247:27 - for alternating series
247:28 - the theorem's a bit of a mouthful but
247:33 - the idea is pretty simple okay the idea
247:36 - is that
247:37 - you can actually approximate an
247:39 - alternating series
247:40 - pretty well by any of its partial sums
247:43 - right
247:44 - so remember that to to satisfy the
247:47 - hypotheses of the alternating series
247:49 - test the terms in this sequence they
247:51 - have to be positive
247:52 - they have to be decreasing and they have
247:54 - to go to zero in the limit
247:55 - right so these numbers are getting
247:57 - smaller and smaller they're getting
247:58 - closer and closer to zero
248:00 - okay because your
248:04 - alternating in sign as you add them we
248:06 - talked about in the very first video for
248:07 - this section we said well you know what
248:09 - what happens is you know
248:10 - you kind of have you know maybe
248:12 - somewhere here is like the actual
248:17 - limit of your sequence right and
248:21 - so you kind of put the first term in and
248:23 - so maybe
248:24 - maybe like zero is over here right maybe
248:27 - here is zero
248:29 - and you add
248:34 - you add a1 and you get to here and then
248:37 - you subtract
248:39 - a2 right and so then you subtract off a2
248:43 - and well a2 has to be smaller than a1 so
248:46 - it doesn't get you all the way back to
248:47 - zero
248:48 - maybe it gets you to there all right and
248:51 - so maybe we'll we'll kind of think about
248:52 - it
248:53 - like this way
248:56 - we'll sort of think about the difference
249:00 - from l
249:01 - so a2 gets you to here all right
249:05 - there's a1 plus
249:09 - or a1 sorry minus a2
249:12 - right and then you add on a3 you add a3
249:15 - onto here
249:16 - and because a3 is smaller than a2 it's
249:20 - not going to get you all the way back to
249:21 - a1 it's going to get you
249:23 - maybe to here right
249:28 - okay so here will be a1 minus a2
249:31 - plus a3 and then you subtract off a4
249:36 - and a4 well it can't take you back that
249:38 - far because it's smaller than
249:39 - a 3 was so maybe it gets you to say here
249:43 - right so then you're kind of over here
249:48 - and there's there's a1
249:51 - minus a2 plus a3
249:54 - minus a4 and now you add on a5 and it
249:58 - can't take you all the way back to there
249:59 - so maybe a5 gets you to there
250:02 - right and so on so let's call this maybe
250:06 - to simplify that should be
250:07 - now s5 right the fifth partial sum right
250:10 - and then s6 might be here
250:15 - s7 might be
250:18 - might be there right so you get closer
250:22 - and closer to l
250:23 - every at every
250:37 - you're jumping back and forth over the
250:38 - limit and every time the jumps get
250:40 - smaller
250:41 - right so that means the
250:44 - the difference between the partial sum
250:47 - that you have here
250:48 - and the limit right well it's always got
250:51 - to be less than the next term because
250:53 - then when you add the next term
250:54 - it takes you to the other side of the
250:56 - limit right it takes you past the limit
250:58 - past the limit so the difference between
251:00 - the limit and the partial sum
251:02 - right the limit of this so the actual
251:04 - series or the infinite series the
251:05 - difference between them
251:06 - it's always less than the next term in
251:08 - the sequence so that's a really useful
251:10 - result that means if you
251:12 - you know if you want to approximate a
251:13 - series because calculating the actual
251:15 - sum of an infinite series is in general
251:17 - very difficult right i mean there's lots
251:19 - of them where we don't even know what
251:20 - the value is
251:22 - but we can figure out what it is
251:24 - approximately because it's easy to
251:26 - calculate the next term in the
251:28 - in the sequence right if we have a
251:30 - formula for the sequence we can
251:31 - calculate the next term
251:32 - figure out how big it is and what that
251:36 - sort of lets us do is say hey
251:37 - this gives us sort of a bound on the
251:39 - error right and that means if we
251:41 - if it's good enough to know the sum of
251:42 - the series accurate to let's say
251:45 - three decimal places well we just have
251:47 - to
251:48 - keep going until these numbers are small
251:50 - enough right
251:51 - once they're less than you know one over
251:53 - five thousand then we know we've got the
251:54 - answer accurate to
251:56 - to five decimal places right and in fact
251:58 - we can we can always just
252:00 - kind of look at the two partial sums
252:04 - consecutive partial sums the limits
252:05 - always in between them right
252:07 - so you just kind of look at consecutive
252:09 - partial sums until the interval between
252:11 - them is small enough
252:13 - and you know that you've got the you
252:15 - know the error that you want
252:17 - right so that's the idea we'll look at a
252:19 - couple of examples
252:20 - and then we'll move on we'll talk about
252:23 - absolute convergence after this all
252:30 - right
252:30 - so we're going to introduce a little bit
252:32 - more terminology here um we'll talk
252:34 - about convergent
252:35 - um series and we're talking two
252:37 - different types of convergence now
252:39 - absolute conversions versus conditional
252:41 - convergence
252:42 - so series converges absolutely
252:46 - if you can take the absolute value of
252:48 - every term in the sequence and the
252:49 - series still converges
252:51 - okay it converges conditionally
252:54 - if this if the series converges but once
252:58 - you take the absolute value
252:59 - it no longer converges right so the the
253:02 - standard example of course
253:04 - is the alternating harmonic series right
253:08 - so the alternating harmonic series
253:13 - minus 1 to the n over n
253:17 - well that converges conditionally
253:24 - right we know that that series converges
253:27 - by the alternating series test but we
253:30 - also know that if we take the absolute
253:32 - value right what happens if you take the
253:33 - absolute value of minus one to the n you
253:35 - just get one
253:36 - right so the absolute value gives you
253:37 - the harmonic series and we know that the
253:39 - harmonic series diverges
253:41 - okay so that's an example of a
253:43 - conditionally convergence here
253:44 - a series okay main results on
253:49 - conditional versus absolute convergence
253:52 - well
253:53 - we have a theorem
253:59 - and the theorem states and you can maybe
254:03 - guess based on the definition that um
254:09 - if a series
254:13 - converges absolutely
254:22 - then it just converges
254:25 - it'll stop right so in other words
254:29 - if the series with the absolute values
254:31 - converges then the corresponding series
254:33 - without the absolute value
254:34 - will also converge right so absolute
254:37 - convergence is a much stronger condition
254:40 - than simple convergence right any
254:41 - absolutely convergence
254:44 - series will converge but conditionally
254:47 - convergent series don't necessarily
254:49 - converge absolutely
254:53 - so this is an important result this
254:55 - comes in handy in a lot of scenarios
254:57 - and and we also mentioned another thing
254:59 - that comes up and again we're not going
255:01 - to address this in a calculus course but
255:04 - if a series converges absolutely
255:06 - alternating or otherwise
255:09 - an absolutely convergent series
255:11 - converges to unique limit there's only
255:13 - one possible value
255:14 - whereas as i mentioned a conditionally
255:16 - convergent series can be rearranged
255:18 - and so you can tell with different
255:19 - rearrangements of this series and
255:20 - there's
255:21 - there's a whole sort of you know section
255:24 - you could study on rearrangements and
255:26 - what can you do there and and you can
255:28 - go through this proof that um you can
255:30 - get any number you
255:32 - want by rearranging a conditionally
255:33 - conversion series
255:35 - which seems really bizarre happens to be
255:37 - true
255:39 - so next up what we want to do is we just
255:40 - want to look at a few examples to see
255:43 - if we can if we can apply this
255:44 - definition and tell the difference
255:46 - between convergent
255:47 - and absolutely convergent series
255:54 - all right so here are three examples of
255:56 - alternating series
255:58 - and we want to decide if they converge
256:00 - absolutely or
256:02 - only conditionally or perhaps not at all
256:05 - looking at the first one right if we
256:08 - if we look at our terms a n
256:12 - n plus 3 over n
256:15 - squared plus 2n plus 5.
256:19 - well we might notice that those are
256:22 - approximately
256:23 - 1 over n for
256:27 - n large right
256:31 - so okay we can do limit comparison right
256:35 - using limit comparison
256:36 - we know that this is going to diverge if
256:39 - we take the absolute value right
256:41 - so without the absolute value we know
256:44 - that
256:47 - that this if we take the absolute value
256:50 - sorry taking the absolute value we know
256:53 - that this diverges
256:57 - right and we do a simple limit
256:59 - comparison for that
257:05 - but it does converge
257:09 - terms are positive they go to zero in
257:11 - the limit
257:12 - and they're decreasing you can check you
257:14 - can use you can use the derivative right
257:16 - we can take the function look at the
257:17 - derivative figure out where it's
257:19 - where it's decreasing it's more work
257:22 - than we can fit on the board here
257:23 - but you can check that they that this
257:25 - does satisfy the conditions of the
257:26 - alternating series test so it is a
257:28 - convergent alternating series
257:30 - um um so in this case we get
257:36 - converges so this will be
257:39 - conditional convergence
257:44 - all right converges conditionally
257:47 - because
257:47 - this does converge alternating series
257:50 - test says that it does
257:51 - but if you drop the minus one to the n
257:53 - it diverges
257:54 - okay it's essentially the alternating
257:56 - harmonics series with a bit of clutter
258:00 - very good moving on to this one um well
258:03 - here we've got that exponential on the
258:06 - bottom
258:07 - we expect that's probably going to win
258:10 - out over a polynomial on the top so we
258:14 - might suspect absolute convergence in
258:16 - this case
258:17 - and if we look at
258:20 - a n to be
258:23 - n squared plus 2n plus 5
258:27 - over 2 to the n
258:30 - this looks like something where maybe
258:31 - we'd use ratio test right
258:34 - ratio possibly root root is going to get
258:36 - ugly with that polynomial though so
258:38 - let's do ratio
258:39 - right a n plus 1 over
258:43 - a n we get
258:48 - n plus one squared plus two times n plus
258:52 - one
258:53 - plus five over two to the n plus one
258:57 - multiply by two to the n over
259:00 - n squared plus two n plus five
259:04 - okay so that's going to be
259:08 - one half times this polynomial
259:11 - which we can we can multiply the whole
259:13 - thing out if we care to i use
259:15 - n squared 2n to n 4n
259:19 - plus 1 plus 2 plus 5
259:22 - something like that details don't really
259:25 - matter down here do they
259:27 - um n squared plus two n
259:30 - plus five okay so if we wanted to apply
259:33 - the ratio test we take the limit of that
259:34 - thing as n goes to infinity
259:36 - uh it's going to go to one half
259:40 - as n goes to infinity and so
259:43 - this one is
259:46 - absolutely convergent
259:51 - by the ratio test
259:56 - right um frequently when we're applying
259:58 - the ratio test
259:59 - test uh we we often use the ratio test
260:02 - as a test for absolute convergence so if
260:05 - if we do have sine factors to deal with
260:07 - we just take the absolute value when we
260:09 - apply the ratio test you're going to see
260:10 - that
260:11 - in the next section when we talk about
260:12 - power series okay
260:16 - the last one well okay the last one
260:18 - diverges
260:21 - we don't have to do any work why does it
260:22 - diverge
260:24 - look at the terms here as n goes to
260:26 - infinity that's going to three over five
260:29 - right so the limit doesn't go to zero
260:32 - right it
260:33 - fails the test for divergence if the uh
260:36 - if
260:36 - a n doesn't go to zero and then goes to
260:38 - infinity we know it can't possibly
260:39 - converge
260:41 - absolutely or otherwise this one just
260:44 - diverges full stop
260:53 - the next topic we want to look at is
260:55 - tailored polynomials
260:56 - now depending on on how your
260:59 - calculus course is sequenced this might
261:01 - be something that you're looking at in
261:03 - the chapter on derivative applications
261:04 - immediately following differentials
261:07 - or it might be something that you're
261:08 - seeing in the context of sequences in
261:10 - series and you've just looked at power
261:11 - series
261:12 - and we're trying to make our way towards
261:14 - taylor series
261:16 - so we'll try to do this so it fits both
261:18 - and
261:19 - we'll probably take this perspective of
261:21 - we're moving on
261:22 - from the linear approximation right the
261:24 - tangent line approximation
261:26 - and we're trying to improve that
261:28 - approximation right
261:30 - and then whether you're thinking this is
261:32 - an application of derivatives or whether
261:33 - you're
261:34 - you're thinking about why taylor series
261:36 - makes sense in either context this will
261:39 - uh this will work out
261:40 - all right so we know that this linear
261:44 - approximation
261:45 - right it works well it works well as
261:47 - long as we stay close to this point
261:48 - right so there's some point
261:50 - you know c here and so if we go from
261:54 - c to c plus delta x then
261:57 - yeah there's not much difference between
261:59 - the y values along the curve and the y
262:01 - values along the tangent but only
262:03 - in some little interval here right once
262:06 - we move out to say here
262:08 - that gap's getting big out here the
262:10 - gap's getting bigger
262:12 - once we're out here the gap is huge
262:14 - right and it's a terrible approximation
262:16 - right
262:16 - it's only a good approximation on a
262:18 - fairly small interval
262:19 - right so if you're interested in
262:22 - improving your approximation
262:24 - there are two choices that you have one
262:27 - is to shrink the interval over which
262:29 - you're making that
262:30 - approximation right you say well look
262:32 - once delta x hits 0.5 the approximation
262:35 - is not good enough
262:36 - let's get down to 0.1 let's get down to
262:38 - 0.01
262:39 - right but maybe you can't reach the
262:42 - values you need to reach by shrinking
262:44 - the interval maybe you need to
262:46 - approximate the function out here
262:48 - using values of the function over here
262:50 - right so that might not be an option
262:52 - so if you can't shrink the interval you
262:55 - look for
262:55 - better ways of approximating right so we
262:58 - know that
263:00 - if we have this l of x right so this is
263:03 - going to be
263:05 - f of c plus f prime of c
263:09 - times x minus c and this is
263:15 - the linear
263:22 - approximation right so the next thing
263:25 - you might ask
263:26 - is can we do
263:29 - can we do something like i don't know
263:31 - let's call it q
263:32 - q for quadratic right could we do
263:35 - something like
263:36 - q of x equals
263:39 - and i don't know maybe the coefficients
263:40 - are going to look different but maybe
263:42 - there's a there's an a0 term
263:44 - right a1 we'll work in powers of x
263:48 - minus c you'll see that's going to be
263:50 - convenient right
263:52 - [Music]
263:52 - [Applause]
263:54 - and
263:56 - and maybe now we go to a second order
263:58 - term right
264:00 - and so we say okay is there is there
264:01 - such a thing
264:04 - as a quadratic approximation can we do
264:06 - that does that even make sense
264:08 - um all right so of course adding on that
264:11 - second order term gives some curvature
264:14 - right we know the second derivative is
264:15 - where you start curving away from just
264:17 - being a line
264:18 - so maybe maybe this quadratic right
264:22 - maybe it does something like this
264:26 - all right
264:30 - all right so you get
264:33 - a better approximation for a larger
264:37 - range of x values that's what we're
264:38 - hoping for okay um
264:41 - maybe you can go to cubic right maybe
264:43 - you can go to maybe like there's a c of
264:44 - x
264:45 - all right so there's like a like a b
264:49 - zero plus b one
264:53 - plus b2
264:57 - b3
264:58 - [Music]
265:01 - times x minus c cubed right maybe
265:02 - there's a cubic
265:04 - and what's that going to look like right
265:06 - so so you play around and you you try to
265:09 - figure this out like can we
265:10 - can we make these approximations and and
265:12 - how are they going to look and maybe the
265:14 - cubic
265:15 - right maybe the cubic does something
265:16 - like
265:18 - you know
265:24 - maybe the cubic does something like that
265:26 - right and you you improve the
265:28 - approximation a little bit more
265:33 - that's what we're trying to accomplish
265:34 - with taylor polynomials that's where
265:35 - we're heading okay
265:37 - is we want to we want to introduce
265:39 - polynomials of higher and higher degree
265:43 - so that we improve on the linear
265:45 - approximation right
265:46 - so we're going to keep adding you know
265:48 - we'll do linear
265:50 - then quadratic then cubic then maybe
265:52 - degree 4 degree 5 degree 6. we'll keep
265:55 - going
265:56 - until we cover as much of the original
265:59 - graph as we need to
266:00 - and as closely as we need to right so
266:02 - the idea is
266:03 - as we add terms we hope that two things
266:06 - happen
266:07 - one is that over the original interview
266:09 - interval that we had
266:11 - our approximation is better than what we
266:13 - had before but also
266:15 - that we can widen the interval and have
266:17 - a reasonable approximation for
266:19 - a a wider range of x values okay we want
266:23 - those two things to happen
266:24 - so in the next video we'll play around
266:26 - with this we'll talk about well
266:28 - how do you decide what these
266:30 - coefficients should be how do we kind of
266:32 - you know
266:33 - get things so that it's a good fit and
266:36 - once we play around with that we're
266:37 - going to arrive
266:38 - at the formula for the coefficients in
266:41 - what's called a taylor polynomial
266:43 - then we'll be able to look at some
266:44 - examples
266:52 - okay so in the last video we introduced
266:55 - this idea that maybe if we
266:57 - if we start adding some higher degree
266:58 - terms onto our linear approximation
267:02 - we can improve over that original
267:04 - tangent line approximation right we can
267:06 - we can get some some curves that match
267:08 - the original graph
267:10 - better and for a better range of values
267:14 - so the problem becomes one of
267:16 - determining what these coefficients
267:18 - should be
267:19 - right and if you're wondering why i
267:22 - chose powers of x minus c rather than
267:24 - simply powers of
267:25 - x well that's because we want to make
267:27 - the comparison at this value
267:29 - x minus or x equals c right so it's nice
267:32 - to be able to just plug in x equals c
267:34 - and of course if you do that all these
267:37 - terms are going to go away
267:38 - right so so let's say we wanted to find
267:47 - q of x what are some things that we're
267:50 - going to require
267:52 - well the minimum requirement that we
267:56 - should put on this thing
267:57 - is that
268:03 - it should agree with the original
268:05 - function at that point right
268:07 - so at c we should have equality exact
268:10 - equality so q of c should equal f of c
268:13 - right makes sense right they should they
268:14 - should touch at that point
268:16 - okay so
268:22 - that means that f of c
268:25 - should be equal to well
268:30 - a zero right because if i put x equals c
268:32 - in here
268:33 - i get zero 0 right so q of c
268:37 - is just a 0 right
268:42 - so now we know what a 0 should be ok
268:46 - what's the next sort of reasonable thing
268:48 - that you might ask
268:50 - um well we probably want them to have
268:54 - the same tangent line at that point
268:56 - right we want we want them to have the
268:58 - same
268:59 - slope as they pass through right if i if
269:02 - i had my curve
269:03 - and i was trying to approximate by a
269:05 - quadratic
269:07 - that agreed at that point but the slopes
269:10 - didn't agree right i probably have
269:12 - something that looks like that
269:13 - that's not going to be a good
269:14 - approximation right so
269:17 - the two curves should be tangent to each
269:19 - other
269:21 - at x equals c well how do i guarantee
269:24 - that the curves are tangent to each
269:25 - other
269:26 - their first derivatives should be equal
269:29 - so q prime of c should be equal to
269:33 - f prime of c right
269:38 - but what's q prime of c well we can just
269:40 - we can take the derivative
269:41 - um this is a constant term so it goes
269:44 - away
269:47 - q prime of c well let's say q prime of x
269:50 - to begin with q prime of x
269:52 - is going to be a 1
269:56 - times the derivative of x minus c which
269:58 - is just 1. so this is just a 1
270:00 - right here we can use the power rule
270:02 - plus chain rule 2 comes down in front
270:05 - 2 times a 2
270:09 - times x minus c times 1 right the
270:13 - derivative of the inside is just 1.
270:15 - so that means that
270:19 - q prime of c is well again this is going
270:23 - to go to 0 so q prime of c is
270:25 - just a 1 and that's what we want to be
270:29 - f prime of c okay
270:33 - so notice what we have so far right this
270:36 - is going to be
270:38 - f of c f prime of c
270:43 - times x minus c so far it looks exactly
270:46 - like the linear approximation but we
270:47 - have
270:48 - this one more term right so now
270:54 - we come to well how do we deal with that
270:57 - last term
270:58 - again we we say okay so we want we want
271:01 - the quadratic to be tangent
271:03 - right so but there's lots of ways that
271:04 - we might set things up so that a
271:06 - quadratic is tangent right maybe we have
271:09 - it
271:09 - kind of come in and and it does i don't
271:13 - know
271:14 - sort of something like
271:18 - this right um that doesn't look like a
271:21 - graph of a function but still
271:23 - the next thing that you want is is you
271:25 - want to say something about
271:28 - the curvature right so for example if
271:30 - we're if we were looking let's say at
271:32 - a maximum or a minimum right
271:35 - i could draw i could draw a quadratic
271:37 - like this
271:39 - right and it would be tangent these two
271:41 - curves are tangent to each other they
271:42 - have the same
271:44 - function value they have the same first
271:45 - derivative at that point
271:47 - right but their second derivatives are
271:48 - way off they're not even the same sign
271:50 - right so the next thing that you
271:52 - probably want is you want to make sure
271:53 - that they kind of curve the same at that
271:55 - point
271:56 - and we know that curvature is concavity
272:00 - is second derivative so
272:06 - the second derivative of q should equal
272:10 - the second derivative
272:12 - of f okay and we say what's q double
272:16 - prime
272:18 - well we just take the derivative here
272:20 - that's the constant it goes away
272:22 - right the constant term always
272:23 - disappears then we have 2 a 2
272:28 - well times 1. okay
272:32 - so this of course that's a constant so
272:34 - that's also the value of
272:36 - q prime of c
272:41 - so q prime of c is 2 a 2
272:44 - and we want that to equal f prime of c
272:47 - and that means that a 2
272:50 - we have to divide by 2 right or f double
272:53 - prime
272:54 - should be f double prime of c over
272:58 - 2. okay so it's not simply just putting
273:02 - the second derivative in there right
273:03 - we have to account for the fact that as
273:05 - we take derivatives of power functions
273:07 - right the powers come down so we can put
273:10 - that in
273:13 - f double prime of c over 2
273:16 - times x minus c squared and now you've
273:19 - got yourself
273:20 - a quadratic approximation right and
273:24 - if you wanted to do cubic well it's
273:26 - going to be the same story right
273:28 - the work that we did here it's going to
273:30 - be exactly the same right
273:32 - you follow through the steps because
273:34 - what would happen is
273:36 - that cubic term would be along for the
273:37 - ride right
273:40 - if we were doing it here we'd still have
273:42 - the 3 would come down we'd have 3
273:44 - b 3 x minus c squared still goes away
273:47 - when you plug in the
273:48 - c x equals c right then you'd come down
273:52 - to here when you did this derivative
273:54 - you'd have the 2 a 2 you'd have a 3
273:57 - times 2 times
273:58 - b3 times x minus c so again it goes away
274:01 - when you get to the third derivative
274:03 - what you're going to find is that
274:05 - c triple prime
274:08 - of x or if you like um
274:12 - because i shouldn't have used c c and c
274:14 - oh well
274:15 - you're going to get it's going to be 3
274:17 - times 2
274:19 - times b3 okay
274:23 - and you'd want that to be equal to
274:26 - f triple prime at c
274:30 - so you work that out and you'd find that
274:32 - okay so c the cubic approximation
274:34 - should be should be f of c f
274:38 - prime of c x minus c
274:42 - f double prime of c over two
274:47 - times x minus c squared and then
274:50 - f triple prime over six
274:54 - times x minus c cubed
274:58 - okay and then you got the cubic
274:59 - approximation and and from here you
275:01 - start thinking you try to figure out
275:02 - what's the pattern where is this going
275:04 - to go from here
275:06 - once you figure out what the pattern is
275:07 - you can write down this general formula
275:10 - for what are called taylor polynomials
275:12 - and we'll do that in the next video
275:20 - all right so now we come to the
275:22 - definition
275:23 - of a taylor polynomial okay so
275:27 - we in the last video we kind of played
275:29 - around we started with the linear
275:30 - approximation and then we asked
275:31 - ourselves you know
275:33 - what if we wanted to move to quadratic
275:34 - approximation what if we wanted to move
275:36 - to a cubic what would the coefficients
275:38 - of those polynomials look like
275:40 - right so you try to generalize that
275:43 - pattern and what you come up with
275:44 - is the definition of a taylor polynomial
275:48 - so the notation that's used in the apex
275:52 - textbooks
275:53 - is just p sub n
275:56 - sometimes you'll see additional
275:57 - decorations here in the subscript you
275:59 - might see
276:00 - p sub n you might see a comma f to
276:03 - indicate the function
276:04 - f you might see a comma c to indicate
276:06 - the point c
276:08 - most of the time we hope that that's
276:11 - clear from the context and just write
276:13 - simply p sub n so p n of x right is
276:16 - going to be
276:18 - f of c plus
276:21 - f prime of c times x minus
276:25 - c there's the linear approximation
276:28 - next term
276:32 - f double prime at c over
276:35 - 2. and i'm going to write that 2
276:39 - as a 2 factorial you'll see why it helps
276:42 - us follow a pattern
276:45 - x minus c squared and we keep going all
276:48 - the way down
276:50 - to a degree n term so we use
276:54 - brackets to indicate derivative right so
276:56 - the n in the bracket means nth
276:58 - derivative
276:59 - nth derivative at c divide by
277:02 - n factorial
277:07 - multiplied by x minus c to the nth power
277:11 - right so the last power that you have is
277:14 - the degree n term right so
277:19 - if it's degree zero well it's just a
277:20 - number that's not very interesting
277:22 - the degree one taylor polynomial is the
277:24 - linear approximation
277:26 - the degree two taylor polynomial is the
277:28 - quadratic approximation
277:30 - right uh and then degree three and so on
277:32 - you can go up to
277:34 - well really any degree that you want
277:36 - okay
277:37 - so that's your taylor polynomial um if
277:40 - you like you can write this
277:41 - in summation notation
277:45 - as the sum
277:48 - k going from 0 to n
277:52 - of the kth derivative at
277:56 - c divided by k factorial
278:01 - times x minus c to the k
278:05 - right and for for those of you that are
278:08 - watching this in the context of
278:09 - sequences in series
278:11 - you've seen power series and so you can
278:14 - probably guess what's going to happen
278:15 - next
278:16 - you let this sum go not to n we're not
278:18 - going to stop at a polynomial
278:20 - we're going to go all the way to a power
278:21 - series we're going to let k go
278:23 - from 0 to infinity and then you have a
278:26 - taylor series right
278:28 - those of you who are seeing this in
278:29 - calculus 1 you're going to stop at
278:31 - degree n
278:32 - right we haven't talked about sequences
278:34 - in series yet
278:35 - okay so that's the formula for taylor
278:37 - polynomials right
278:39 - um that factorial just as a reminder
278:41 - right
278:43 - k factorial is notation for the product
278:47 - of the first k integers so 1 times 2 and
278:51 - so on
278:52 - up to k right so 1 factorial is just
278:56 - 1 2 factorial 1 times 2 which is 2
279:00 - 3 factorial 1 times 2 times 3 which is
279:02 - 6.
279:03 - we saw that in the in the last video for
279:06 - the cubic
279:06 - and so on right and these factorials
279:09 - they grow very fast
279:10 - right 4 factorial
279:14 - 24 not so big 5 factorial 120 6
279:18 - factorial
279:19 - 720 right 7 factorial is like 5040
279:24 - right 8 factorial now you're into like
279:27 - the 40 thousands
279:28 - right they they grow very big very fast
279:31 - okay
279:32 - to make this formula work there's a
279:34 - there's a convention
279:36 - right that zero factorial is defined to
279:38 - be one
279:40 - um right so that you can
279:44 - write all the terms there are other
279:46 - reasons why zero factorial should be one
279:48 - other than making the formula work
279:50 - but at this point in your career you can
279:52 - tell yourself that's why
279:54 - if if you like and of course
279:57 - the whole point of this
280:00 - taylor polynomial is that
280:06 - for k equal to 0 1
280:10 - 2 all the way up to n
280:13 - if you take k derivatives of this
280:16 - polynomial
280:18 - and you plug in c you are going to get
280:21 - the same result
280:22 - as taking k derivatives of your original
280:25 - function
280:26 - and plugging in c right the reason you
280:29 - have these factorials is that as you
280:30 - take derivatives right using the power
280:32 - rule
280:32 - right the first time you take the
280:34 - derivative n comes down in front
280:36 - then an n minus 1 then an n minus 2 and
280:38 - so on
280:39 - right until you've taken n derivatives
280:41 - and at that point you've got an n
280:42 - factorial out front that cancels with
280:44 - the n factorial here
280:46 - leaves you with the nth derivative at c
280:48 - all right
280:49 - by that time all the other terms are
280:51 - lower degrees so they've all disappeared
280:53 - when you take the derivative right
280:55 - and of course if you if you only take if
280:57 - you've taken fewer than n derivatives
280:58 - there's still going to be a
280:59 - an x minus c left in there so when you
281:01 - plug in x equals c
281:02 - you get a zero and those higher order
281:04 - terms they go away as well
281:06 - right so it works out so the idea here
281:09 - is that you want
281:10 - the derivatives of your polynomial to
281:12 - match the derivatives of
281:14 - your function and when you do that
281:17 - you find that the values of your
281:19 - polynomial
281:20 - agree very well with the values of your
281:22 - function at least over some interval
281:24 - right
281:25 - eventually they're going to diverge but
281:26 - over some interval
281:28 - they're going to agree right if you are
281:30 - in the context of looking at series
281:32 - right
281:32 - um we'll see later on that as you add
281:35 - more terms
281:36 - the approximation gets better and it
281:37 - gets better over a bigger interval
281:40 - so if you add infinitely many terms well
281:43 - maybe you actually get exact agreement
281:45 - everywhere right that's the goal of
281:46 - taylor series
281:47 - which you're going to see one last note
281:52 - is that if you put
281:56 - c equal to zero
282:00 - you get what are called um
282:04 - maclaurin polynomials okay
282:13 - so frequently in a lot of problems
282:14 - you'll be working with maclaurin
282:15 - polynomials
282:16 - just because they're simpler right
282:18 - instead of bringing in powers of say x
282:20 - minus 2 or x minus
282:21 - 3 or something like that you just work
282:23 - in powers of x right
282:25 - so maclaurin polynomials are going to
282:27 - look like
282:30 - you know f of 0 f prime of
282:34 - 0 times x f double prime of 0 over
282:37 - 2 times x squared and so on
282:41 - right so you deal with powers of x and
282:43 - they're they're a little bit simpler
282:45 - okay so that's how we define taylor
282:47 - polynomials
282:48 - it's time to look at some examples where
282:50 - we try to compute these and see how this
282:52 - example works in practice
282:59 - all right let's start with an example
283:02 - here
283:02 - kind of a standard relatively simple
283:05 - example um
283:06 - computing taylor polynomials and
283:09 - we'll hope that this example illustrates
283:11 - a couple of things
283:12 - one how the process works how you come
283:15 - up with the taylor polynomial how you
283:16 - sort of identify patterns and then
283:18 - generalize
283:19 - right um degree n right if we wanted
283:22 - like degree 100 we're not going to
283:23 - calculate 100 derivatives we want to
283:25 - figure out what's going on
283:27 - the other is is sort of the reason that
283:29 - we care about taylor polynomials
283:32 - sort of right and the point is that
283:35 - functions like the exponential function
283:38 - uh
283:38 - we we tend not to think about this these
283:40 - days because we have calculators and
283:42 - computers that will give us the values
283:44 - of these functions right for any x value
283:47 - that we want for any degree of accuracy
283:49 - that we want
283:50 - um we just get it out of a machine right
283:53 - but well one there's the question of
283:57 - how do the machines come up with those
283:58 - values right how are they programmed to
284:00 - compute these things
284:01 - uh you know and and how did people
284:03 - figure this out before they had
284:05 - calculators in computers right because
284:07 - people have been working with
284:07 - exponential functions for a very long
284:09 - time
284:11 - and well back in the day
284:14 - instead of calculators what people had
284:16 - were huge books full of tables of values
284:18 - um telling them you know if you wanted
284:21 - to know the value of
284:23 - e at 1.6
284:26 - you could find you go through the book
284:27 - you'd look it up in the table and
284:29 - you would get the value right um this is
284:31 - what you had to do
284:33 - right and and how did people make those
284:35 - books how did they fill them out how
284:36 - they calculate them well they didn't
284:38 - have calculators available right so they
284:39 - had to
284:40 - do computations that could be
284:43 - done by hand polynomial calculations
284:48 - can be done by hand right we
284:51 - you know all is involved in in computing
284:54 - polynomials
284:55 - is powers products
284:58 - and sums right or differences right so
285:02 - it's all basic you know to compute a
285:03 - polynomial you need only basic
285:05 - arithmetic
285:06 - right and basic arithmetic in principle
285:08 - can be done by hand if you're patient
285:10 - enough
285:11 - all right so you imagine that maybe
285:13 - maybe you've learned all about
285:15 - the exponential function you know what
285:17 - its derivatives are and things like that
285:19 - you've but somehow you've made it this
285:20 - far in your calculus career without
285:22 - actually ever
285:22 - learning the value of e well
285:26 - let's see how you might come up with it
285:30 - so
285:33 - first we're going to try to compute the
285:38 - general degree n maclaurin polynomial
285:40 - right
285:41 - and so remember maclaurin
285:45 - means that we're doing a taylor
285:47 - polynomial with this c
285:49 - value set to zero right so
285:54 - f x is e to the x right
285:59 - f prime of x is
286:02 - e to the x f double prime of x
286:06 - is e to the x and
286:10 - well okay you get the idea right nothing
286:12 - happens when you take derivatives of the
286:14 - exponential function
286:15 - okay so
286:19 - f of zero is one
286:23 - f prime of zero is one
286:27 - f double prime of zero is one right
286:30 - in fact all the derivatives of the
286:32 - exponential function
286:34 - are equal to one at zero okay
286:38 - so
286:41 - our maclaurin polynomial p n we know
286:44 - that the definition looks like this
286:47 - f of zero plus f prime of zero
286:50 - times x plus f
286:53 - double prime of zero over two factorial
286:58 - times x squared uh you know what let's
287:00 - go to f triple prime for good measure
287:03 - why not f triple prime
287:05 - at zero over three factorial
287:09 - times x cubed and so on
287:13 - down to that last derivative
287:17 - over n factorial times x to the n
287:21 - but now we know all these derivatives
287:24 - are just one
287:26 - so what we get is one plus x
287:30 - plus x squared over 2 factorial
287:35 - plus x cubed over 3 factorial
287:40 - and so on down to x to the n
287:45 - over n factorial right which is a fairly
287:48 - nice simple pattern easy enough to
287:52 - follow
287:52 - right if you want
287:55 - you could use summation notation
287:59 - right and write this as x to the k
288:04 - over k factorial those of you who are
288:07 - looking at sequences in series
288:10 - let n go to infinity here and what you
288:14 - will have is actually a series
288:15 - representation for the exponential
288:17 - function
288:18 - and what we're going to see is that's
288:19 - actually valid for all real numbers
288:21 - um so replace that n by infinity and
288:25 - this
288:26 - is e to the x exactly equal to e to the
288:28 - x
288:29 - but if you truncate if you stop at some
288:31 - point
288:32 - you only have an approximation of e to
288:35 - the x
288:35 - right so the idea is the more terms you
288:37 - add the better the approximation
288:39 - gets right and the closer you state is
288:42 - zero
288:43 - the better your approximation will be
288:45 - okay
288:47 - so how do we approximate e
288:50 - well what is e e
288:57 - is f of one okay
289:00 - now it says use p5 okay so
289:03 - how is that going to work so what that
289:04 - means is we want to say that
289:07 - e is f of 1
289:11 - and you know the whole point of these
289:14 - taylor polynomials is they're supposed
289:15 - to approximate the original function so
289:17 - f
289:17 - of 1 should be approximately
289:21 - p5 of 1 right and this approximation
289:24 - should
289:25 - in theory be better than the linear
289:26 - approximation okay so what's p5 at 1
289:30 - well we go up to degree 5 we set x equal
289:33 - to 1
289:33 - so that's a 1 that's a 1 that's a one
289:35 - the next so we have
289:36 - one plus a half
289:40 - plus one over three factorial
289:44 - plus one over four factorial
289:48 - plus 1 over 5 factorial
289:53 - if you want to work those out
290:03 - you get up to there okay
290:06 - and if you want to go a little bit
290:08 - further
290:09 - you can get everything all over a common
290:11 - denominator
290:14 - 120 plus
290:18 - 60 plus 20 plus
290:21 - 5 plus 1
290:25 - over 120 okay so
290:28 - 180 200 206
290:35 - is that right probably did something
290:38 - wrong
290:39 - a good chance i did something wrong but
290:42 - so we get we had something like this
290:43 - right
290:44 - um yeah
290:47 - okay um
290:50 - and then we say okay what is that
290:52 - approximately here's where i think this
290:53 - is wrong because i think
290:56 - that's less than two right and then what
290:58 - we should be getting here is
291:00 - two point so that the decimal value
291:03 - should be 2.71
291:05 - 667 something like that
291:08 - um which is why i think i made a mistake
291:11 - um
291:13 - ignore this part i've done something
291:16 - wrong there
291:19 - that part's fine okay so we get this
291:21 - value 2.7 something
291:24 - which is pretty good the calculator
291:26 - value if you ask the calculator to give
291:28 - you e
291:28 - up to up to four four four or five
291:31 - decimal places what you're gonna get is
291:33 - and again it's only approximate because
291:35 - it goes on forever um but you get like
291:40 - 2.71818 i think is how e starts
291:43 - okay um so so this approximation is is
291:47 - pretty good
291:47 - right first two decimal places are
291:50 - accurate we're off by
291:51 - two in the third decimal place and and
291:54 - if we added more terms
291:56 - well our approximation would would keep
291:58 - getting better and better oh
292:00 - ha i know what's wrong i fixed it
292:04 - what did i miss one plus one
292:10 - i'm not wrong i just have to add in a
292:13 - term
292:14 - so that's not 206 it's 326.
292:19 - divide by 120 and yeah that gives you
292:21 - that 2.7
292:23 - okay so as a means of approximation it's
292:27 - pretty good
292:28 - what we still have to do is we have to
292:29 - figure out whether we can get some idea
292:31 - of a quantifying this approximation
292:34 - do we know ahead of time if we don't
292:35 - know that value do i know whether or not
292:37 - that's a good approximation
292:39 - we need some means of testing right
292:41 - that's going to come later
292:48 - let's do another example this time we're
292:51 - going to go with
292:52 - a slightly more complicated function
292:54 - right um we did the exponential function
292:56 - last time
292:58 - so maybe a little bit too easy because
293:00 - you know we don't have to do any work to
293:02 - compute the derivatives i've done the
293:03 - first four derivatives here just to get
293:05 - us started
293:06 - right and obviously there's a little bit
293:09 - more work involved than there was for
293:10 - the exponential function
293:12 - but we might also notice that these
293:14 - derivatives if we're looking carefully
293:16 - they follow a bit of a pattern right
293:19 - so we look and we see what kind of
293:20 - patterns can we see
293:22 - ignoring the first one let's look down
293:24 - here we notice that
293:26 - we have positive negative positive
293:29 - negative right
293:29 - the signs alternate and you can kind of
293:31 - see that the signs are going to keep
293:33 - alternating because
293:34 - the minus signs are coming from these
293:36 - exponents coming down
293:37 - from the power rule right so every time
293:39 - the exponent comes down we're going to
293:40 - get another minus sign because the
293:42 - exponent's getting more and more and
293:43 - more negative
293:44 - right also every time we take a
293:46 - derivative
293:47 - we're multiplying by the next biggest
293:49 - number right
293:50 - so when we get to the fifth derivative
293:51 - we're gonna multiply by minus four so
293:53 - the minus sign goes away
293:55 - and now we have two times three times
293:56 - four
293:58 - which is four factorial right three
294:01 - factorial two
294:02 - factorial one factorial so
294:05 - this is this kind of idea of you're
294:06 - looking for these patterns right you
294:08 - so and you might have to sit and think
294:10 - about this for a while but eventually
294:11 - you work out that okay
294:12 - once i've done
294:16 - k derivatives
294:19 - okay well
294:23 - i'm going to have an x to the minus k
294:27 - right minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 minus 4.
294:30 - and we have that factorial in front
294:37 - okay but it's one less than the exponent
294:40 - right
294:40 - k minus 1 factorial with a k there right
294:43 - it's always one less
294:44 - but there's one thing missing right
294:45 - what's missing i'm missing
294:48 - a sine factor how do i account for that
294:51 - sine factor
294:52 - well the standard way we do this
294:55 - is we use powers of minus one right an
294:58 - even power of minus one
295:00 - we're multiplying by one and even number
295:02 - of times gonna be positive
295:04 - odd number of times negative okay
295:08 - so we say okay can we just do minus 1 to
295:11 - the k
295:12 - multiply by minus 1 k times well we look
295:15 - at this we say that doesn't quite work
295:16 - right because
295:18 - look it's positive here when k is odd
295:20 - it's negative here
295:21 - when k is even right and that's going to
295:25 - give me the wrong sign
295:26 - so i could put another minus sign out
295:27 - front or we just shift this exponent
295:31 - either add or subtract 1. it doesn't
295:34 - really matter but maybe you like this to
295:35 - match that k minus 1 factorial
295:38 - so we put the k minus 1 out front okay
295:41 - and
295:41 - now that means that when we put x equal
295:44 - to 1
295:50 - okay let's just do this for now
295:55 - put the denominator in soon we've got
295:59 - minus 1 to the k minus 1
296:04 - times k minus 1 factorial times
296:09 - 1 to the minus k
296:13 - and of course 1 to any power is just 1.
296:15 - so what we have here
296:16 - is just minus 1 to the k minus 1.
296:22 - times k minus 1 factorial okay
296:26 - but we know that when we when we set up
296:28 - our taylor polynomial we're going to
296:30 - divide by
296:31 - k factorial right
296:34 - so if we do k derivatives evaluate at
296:36 - one divided by k factorial
296:39 - we've got -1 to the k minus 1
296:45 - k minus 1 factorial over
296:49 - factorial okay now that simplifies right
296:53 - think about what you've got there
296:56 - k minus 1 factorial over k factorial
297:00 - this is 1 times 2 times three
297:05 - and so on up to k minus one
297:09 - on the bottom is one times two times
297:12 - three
297:13 - and so on up to k minus one and then
297:16 - times
297:16 - k right so
297:21 - pretty much everything cancels right 2's
297:24 - cancel the 3's cancel the 4's cancel
297:26 - the k minus 1's cancel all you're left
297:29 - with here
297:32 - is 1 over k so what we get
297:36 - is minus 1 to the k minus 1
297:40 - over k right and of course you could
297:43 - also
297:44 - you know if you didn't see that you can
297:45 - do it by plugging in x equals one
297:48 - look at the pattern for for f for the
297:50 - derivatives evaluated at one and then go
297:52 - from there
297:53 - okay so that means that our degree n
297:56 - taylor polynomial
297:58 - is going to look like this
298:02 - now remember that because we're doing
298:04 - this at 1 we're not going to expand in
298:06 - powers of x like we did for the
298:07 - maclaurin polynomial we're going to
298:09 - expand in powers of
298:10 - x minus 1. okay so um f
298:14 - of one what's f f of one is zero right
298:17 - log of one is zero so we start with zero
298:20 - plus um
298:23 - f prime is one
298:27 - times x minus 1 f double prime
298:32 - minus 1 times x minus 1 squared
298:36 - right then plus
298:41 - one oh sorry one half
298:44 - there right minus one from here but then
298:48 - we had to divide by the
298:49 - by the two factorial so minus one over
298:51 - two right and then
298:56 - 1 3 right because we have that 2
298:58 - factorial over 3 factorial leaves me
299:00 - with the 1 3
299:02 - x minus 1 cubed and so on
299:06 - all right minus 1 to the k minus 1
299:10 - over k times x minus 1 to the k
299:15 - there's your degree and taylor
299:16 - polynomial okay
299:19 - so now p6 in particular
299:22 - right if i wanted to approximate the
299:24 - natural log of 1.5 right i would say
299:27 - okay so p6
299:30 - at 1.5 is going to be
299:35 - well it's going to be 1 times so 1.5
299:38 - minus 1
299:40 - is a half minus a half
299:44 - times a half squared plus a third
299:50 - times a half cubed minus a quarter
299:55 - times a half to the fourth plus a fifth
300:00 - times a half to the fifth minus a sixth
300:06 - times a half to the sixth
300:10 - okay now if you
300:15 - actually work that fraction out and you
300:17 - simplify you get it over a common
300:18 - denominator
300:19 - what you get is 259 over
300:23 - 6 40
300:26 - or approximately
300:30 - what is it going to be i wrote it down
300:31 - over there 0.40
300:38 - and if you compare the the actual value
300:43 - for the natural log of 1.5 if you look
300:46 - it up
300:46 - using your your calculator you're going
300:49 - to get 0.4055
300:54 - not bad accurate to two decimal places
300:57 - we're only off by one in the third
300:59 - decimal place
301:00 - seems okay all right now um
301:04 - if you go ahead and you calculate um p6
301:07 - at
301:07 - two well then those powers of one-half
301:12 - they disappear right you're just gonna
301:13 - have one
301:14 - it's just gonna be one because we're
301:16 - gonna do powers of one right two minus
301:18 - one
301:19 - just gives me one
301:25 - so we get that okay
301:30 - and so this works out to
301:33 - 37 over 60
301:36 - or approximately 0.6167
301:44 - okay and
301:47 - you might hope that hey we're going to
301:48 - we're going to get this great
301:49 - approximation again
301:51 - but this time well the best we do
301:56 - is the first decimal place okay the
301:59 - actual value
302:00 - 6931 actually i guess if you round you
302:03 - don't even have the first decimal place
302:04 - all right
302:05 - um so that's not very good right
302:08 - so again we see that even even once you
302:11 - go to like a higher degree polynomial it
302:13 - might still happen that as your delta
302:15 - x grows right as the change in x grows
302:18 - the error in using these to approximate
302:21 - it's going to grow with the size of
302:22 - delta x
302:23 - and depending on the function it might
302:25 - grow faster or slower
302:27 - for the exponential function it's
302:28 - actually not that bad
302:31 - as you add more and more terms your
302:32 - approximation
302:34 - gets pretty good pretty fast the natural
302:37 - log it turns out and we'll
302:39 - we'll see this if we look at some other
302:41 - some other sort of analysis techniques
302:44 - the natural log takes a really really
302:46 - really long
302:47 - time um to give you a good approximation
302:50 - once you go out
302:51 - to two or further out even if we went to
302:55 - like 100 terms
302:57 - we still wouldn't be all that satisfied
302:59 - with our approximation
303:01 - so things really depend on the function
303:04 - for these taylor polynomial
303:06 - approximations
303:14 - in this next example we're just going to
303:15 - compute a couple of maclaurin
303:17 - polynomials
303:19 - the point of this example is is to
303:21 - illustrate something that's going to be
303:22 - useful for you
303:23 - if you are going to use a lot of taylor
303:25 - polynomials and especially if you're
303:26 - doing
303:27 - taylor series one of the things that
303:30 - comes up is you need ways to
303:32 - kind of do these things efficiently
303:34 - right you can't be sitting there all day
303:35 - taking derivative after derivative after
303:37 - derivative until you spot a pattern
303:39 - right these things they tend to get
303:40 - pretty messy and so far we've only
303:43 - looked at relatively simple functions
303:45 - right once the functions get more
303:46 - complicated
303:47 - maybe the pattern doesn't emerge right
303:49 - away and maybe the derivatives get
303:51 - really messy really fast
303:54 - are there other techniques that you can
303:56 - use turns out yes
303:58 - you're going to see some of those once
304:00 - you learn how to you know manipulate
304:02 - series taking derivatives and
304:05 - anti-derivatives of series there are
304:06 - some tricks that you can do there
304:08 - right if you're seeing this in calc 1
304:10 - you don't have those tricks up your
304:12 - sleeves but there's still some basic
304:14 - things that you can notice if you start
304:15 - playing around with some of these
304:16 - examples
304:17 - like this one here so for part a
304:22 - well we don't know what's going on with
304:24 - the sine functions so we just
304:26 - start taking derivatives and we see what
304:28 - happens right so f of x
304:31 - is sine f prime of x
304:36 - is is cos f double prime
304:41 - is negative sine the third derivative
304:47 - is negative cosine and once we get the
304:51 - fourth derivative
304:52 - right where we're back where we started
304:56 - all right so not as simple
305:00 - as the exponential function but there's
305:02 - still a pattern right
305:04 - cycle repeats every four derivatives
305:06 - right so once you know how to do
305:08 - you know up to p3 you kind of have some
305:10 - idea of how it's going to go from there
305:12 - right so we start computing
305:17 - f of zero is zero f
305:20 - prime of zero cosine of zero is one
305:23 - okay f double prime of zero
305:27 - is 0 again f triple prime of 0
305:31 - is minus 1. okay and from there the
305:34 - pattern is going to repeat
305:35 - right so the coefficients are always
305:37 - going to go 0
305:38 - 1 0 -1 0 1 0
305:42 - minus 1. so you know in fact if we
305:45 - wanted to we could say hey let's do the
305:47 - degree n
305:48 - maclaurin polynomial right and it's
305:50 - going to look like
305:52 - well maybe we say
305:58 - something like 2n plus 1 right because
306:01 - the even degree terms
306:03 - don't show up the coefficient is 0. so
306:06 - what we're going to get is something
306:07 - that looks like
306:11 - x right 1 times x
306:14 - minus so there's no x squared term so
306:16 - the next term is going to be
306:18 - x cubed over 3 factorial
306:22 - there's no degree 4 term
306:25 - all right so the next one is x to the 5
306:28 - right so the next derivative
306:30 - is going to be cosine again which is
306:31 - derivative is 1
306:33 - over 5 factorial so you have x to the 5
306:36 - over 5 factorial right
306:40 - and if we wanted degree 5 we're done
306:43 - otherwise going to 7
306:46 - and why not
306:49 - there's 7 factorial and what does this
306:53 - look like
306:53 - you know at the end so if we think of
306:56 - this in terms of
306:58 - you know n this is
307:01 - 2 times 0 plus 1 degree 1
307:04 - 2 times one plus one two
307:08 - times two plus one
307:11 - two times three plus one right
307:14 - so in general we get
307:18 - an x to the 2 times n plus 1
307:22 - over 2 n plus 1
307:25 - factorial and what about the signs
307:29 - um plus signs for 0
307:33 - 2 next would be 4 and so on minus signs
307:36 - for 1
307:37 - 3 next would be 5. so plus signs when
307:41 - n is even minus signs when n is odd
307:44 - so we should have a
307:48 - minus 1 to the n out front okay
307:52 - well that's not so bad now
307:55 - degree 10 maclaurin polynomial for sine
307:58 - of x squared
307:59 - right so this gets a little bit trickier
308:02 - because
308:04 - now we've got chain rule with the
308:05 - derivatives and i need 10 of them
308:08 - all right and of course the point of
308:10 - this exercise
308:11 - is for us to realize at the end that we
308:12 - didn't have to do this
308:14 - but you've got to do it once before you
308:16 - before you realize that
308:18 - okay so 2x
308:22 - cos x squared right
308:25 - second derivative okay
308:28 - product rule now 2
308:33 - cos x squared all right and then
308:36 - minus so we've got to do uh 4
308:39 - x squared sine
308:42 - x squared right derivative of cos
308:45 - becomes negative sine
308:46 - x squared on the inside multiply by the
308:48 - derivative 2x
308:49 - times the 2x that's already there all
308:51 - right
308:54 - okay and by now you're probably getting
308:57 - concerned that i said i wanted to go all
308:58 - the way to
308:59 - 10 derivatives let's
309:02 - let's do a couple more okay derivative
309:04 - of cos is negative sign
309:06 - right 2x is going to come up minus 4x
309:09 - sine x squared okay
309:13 - minus 8x sine x squared
309:16 - so i guess let's just combine let's try
309:19 - to speed things up here
309:21 - 12x and then 4x squared times the
309:24 - derivative of sine
309:25 - cos there's another 2x
309:28 - 8x cubed cos
309:32 - x squared okay
309:37 - fourth derivative
309:41 - we're going to get minus 12
309:45 - sine of x squared huh okay
309:50 - minus 12x cos theta so minus 24
309:55 - x squared i want another 24 so actually
309:58 - 48 x squared cos x squared
310:02 - okay and then derivative cos is negative
310:06 - sine minus minus
310:08 - plus 16x to the four
310:13 - you tired of this yet i'm tired of this
310:16 - should we keep going
310:18 - maybe one more i don't know if i even
310:22 - want to do one more
310:24 - yeah let's do two more
310:28 - okay um minus 12 derivative sign is cos
310:32 - with a 2x so minus 24x
310:36 - x squared um
310:40 - plus okay a whole bunch of other stuff
310:42 - that i'm not going to do
310:43 - all right but it's all going to have x's
310:45 - in it and
310:47 - x is going to be set to zero right we're
310:48 - doing maclaurin
310:50 - i just want to point out that the next
310:52 - one g6
310:54 - is going to have minus 24
311:01 - cos x squared in it and some other stuff
311:04 - okay so
311:08 - g of 0 is 0. g
311:12 - prime of 0 0 g double prime of 0
311:17 - i get something i get 2.
311:21 - g triple prime is 0
311:25 - 4th derivative 0
311:29 - 5th derivative 0
311:33 - the sixth derivative
311:37 - is minus 24
311:41 - okay which happens to be minus
311:45 - 4 factorial
311:48 - not that you were keeping score um okay
311:51 - i'll i'll i'll tell you what's going to
311:53 - happen next uh the seventh derivative
311:58 - and the eighth derivative
312:01 - and the ninth derivatives if you if you
312:04 - care to keep going
312:05 - they're all going to be zero the tenth
312:09 - derivative
312:13 - it won't be zero okay the tenth
312:15 - derivative
312:20 - well it's going to give us a number um
312:24 - we got to figure it out but we're not
312:26 - going to go all that way let me just
312:27 - tell you what happens because this is
312:28 - already kind of we're
312:29 - pushing 10 minutes here um what we're
312:32 - going to get
312:33 - for my p5
312:36 - and x okay it's going to be so the first
312:39 - non-zero thing is here
312:41 - two so two over two factorial those
312:44 - cancel right
312:45 - two over two factorial times x squared i
312:47 - get x squared
312:48 - the next one is here at six minus four
312:51 - factorial over
312:54 - 6 factorial okay
312:58 - times x to the sixth now the next term
313:01 - i'm going to get
313:02 - is going to be as we said there's going
313:05 - to be an x
313:05 - to the 10 okay
313:11 - should be dividing by 10 factorial right
313:13 - but what we're going to find is that
313:16 - in the end there's only five factorial
313:20 - left over
313:22 - okay so what you actually get for x to
313:24 - the 10 here it turns out what you're
313:26 - going to get
313:26 - is it's going to be 10 factorial
313:30 - divided by 5 factorial is is the number
313:32 - that's going to come out
313:33 - um okay does that work
313:37 - yeah yeah okay um
313:40 - so and so the point of this is four
313:42 - factorial of two factorial
313:44 - um that that should simplify right uh
313:47 - yeah let me make sure i got this right
313:51 - yeah should be should just leave with a
313:53 - six
313:55 - i might have made some mistakes here
313:57 - what you should get
313:59 - is you replace x by x squared everywhere
314:02 - so you get
314:06 - x squared and then you get 1 over 3
314:08 - factorial
314:10 - so this should be a 5 factorial
314:14 - times x squared cubed
314:18 - plus 1 over 5 factorial times x squared
314:23 - to the fifth and so on and so actually
314:26 - all you have to do
314:27 - is replace x by x squared and the one
314:30 - that you already have
314:32 - and you get the next one along the way
314:34 - okay um
314:36 - i've almost certainly made some
314:38 - calculation errors here
314:40 - not surprising given what i'm dealing
314:42 - with right
314:44 - it's it's a bit of a mess um
314:47 - you can sort of see how this might
314:48 - happen but
314:50 - you should end up with something that
314:51 - looks like that right so you can kind of
314:53 - you start playing around you start
314:54 - learning these tricks
314:56 - um you can plug one thing into another
314:59 - sometimes
314:59 - doesn't always work out but
315:03 - you definitely do not want to sit down
315:06 - and calculate 10 derivatives of this of
315:09 - sine of x squared
315:11 - using using the chain rule that's going
315:12 - to be a terrible mess right
315:14 - um if you see something like that you
315:17 - have to guess that
315:19 - probably there was a better way to do it
315:31 - all right so we've been looking at
315:33 - taylor polynomials and we've looked at a
315:35 - number of examples which have suggested
315:37 - that going beyond the linear
315:40 - approximation
315:41 - for your function at a given point c to
315:44 - higher order polynomial approximations
315:46 - gives you better results
315:48 - over a wider range of values right
315:52 - so remember that our taylor polynomial
315:57 - right looks like f of a
316:02 - plus f prime of a or sorry c
316:06 - we're doing c for our interval
316:11 - times x minus c there's the linear
316:14 - approximation
316:15 - right um plus these higher order terms
316:18 - right
316:19 - which all come by taking higher and
316:21 - higher order derivatives
316:23 - evaluating at that point c we divide by
316:27 - this factorial
316:29 - and we multiply by the corresponding
316:32 - power of x minus c
316:34 - okay and we've seen that there are some
316:37 - functions like
316:38 - for example trigonometric functions
316:40 - where these taylor polynomials actually
316:42 - approximate
316:43 - very well over a fairly wide range of
316:46 - values
316:47 - there are other functions like natural
316:49 - logarithm
316:51 - where these don't work as well as you
316:54 - might like right over a small range of
316:56 - interval
316:56 - a small range of values not too bad
317:00 - but there's always a point where you
317:02 - move just a little bit further away and
317:04 - and suddenly the approximation is
317:06 - terrible and it doesn't matter how many
317:07 - terms you add to your taylor polynomial
317:09 - it doesn't really seem to improve all
317:10 - that much
317:12 - okay so what the next step here is is
317:16 - once you've
317:17 - established your approximation you want
317:18 - to know how good your approximation
317:20 - is right and and keep in mind that you
317:23 - might be doing this in some scenario
317:25 - where you don't necessarily know how to
317:27 - compute the function exactly right
317:30 - because we have graphing calculators and
317:32 - computers and things that
317:33 - give us quite precise values for these
317:36 - functions we sort of
317:38 - sometimes fail to appreciate why
317:40 - something like taylor's theorem is
317:41 - useful
317:42 - taylor's theorem is useful because you
317:44 - might be in a scenario where you
317:46 - don't actually know how to compute the
317:48 - function precisely but you can compute
317:50 - tailored polynomials
317:52 - right or some other kind of
317:54 - approximation for your function
317:56 - and let's say you want to know the value
317:58 - of your function accurate up to let's
318:00 - say six decimal places because that's
318:01 - what you're going to display
318:02 - well then you need to be able to figure
318:04 - out how many terms do you need to put in
318:07 - your polynomial
318:08 - to give the value accurate to six
318:10 - decimal places at a particular point
318:12 - right so at a particular value of x
318:14 - how big does n have to be before i know
318:16 - i've got six decimal places right
318:20 - so you might need to solve these
318:21 - problems taylor's theorem
318:24 - gives you one means of doing so okay
318:27 - so taylor's theorem says that as long as
318:31 - you've got enough continuous derivatives
318:33 - right so if you want to use a degree n
318:35 - taylor polynomial
318:37 - you need this derivative but you also
318:38 - need the next one okay you need n plus
318:41 - one continuous derivatives
318:43 - as long as you've got enough continuous
318:44 - derivatives you can write your function
318:47 - as the taylor polynomial plus a
318:50 - remainder
318:51 - right so notice it's equals here it's
318:53 - not an approximation it's equals right
318:55 - this remainder right this
318:59 - should be thought of here as sort of
319:01 - your error term right it's telling you
319:03 - you know the difference right if i move
319:05 - this if i subtract that over it's giving
319:06 - you the difference between the
319:08 - original function and the
319:11 - taylor polynomial right so typically
319:14 - what we're interested in here
319:16 - is we're interested in actually the
319:18 - absolute value
319:21 - of this remainder right and then often
319:24 - at a particular point where we're where
319:26 - we're evaluating things um
319:28 - and so if you're looking at this you
319:30 - realize that okay
319:31 - well this is just a constant i don't
319:33 - need to worry about that right
319:35 - there there is there's a couple of
319:37 - things here that you have to watch out
319:39 - for
319:39 - um well i mean you have this term but
319:42 - actually this
319:44 - it's it's not as as as difficult to deal
319:46 - with as you might think because
319:48 - for whatever problem you're doing with
319:49 - you've chosen c in advance right you
319:51 - choose the point where you're centering
319:52 - your taylor polynomial
319:54 - and now we're trying to decide for a
319:56 - given x how good is our approximation so
319:58 - we've chosen our x
319:59 - uh the only other wild card here is this
320:02 - t
320:03 - right um now this particular
320:07 - remainder here this is what's called the
320:09 - lagrange
320:11 - form of the remainder it's one of
320:15 - actually
320:15 - there's like often three different forms
320:18 - that you find for this remainder three
320:20 - different remainder formulas um the
320:24 - first one is is derived using sort of
320:26 - integration arguments and it's
320:28 - quite tricky to get to but once you have
320:29 - that first one then there are sort of
320:31 - mean value theorem
320:32 - arguments that you can make to arrive at
320:34 - simpler remainder formulas
320:36 - and so this t here all we know about t
320:40 - is that it's in this interval that we're
320:41 - working on actually you can
320:43 - you can say a little bit more it's
320:47 - it's between if you want to narrow it
320:51 - down it's between
320:52 - x and c it's somewhere in between those
320:54 - two values right
320:57 - but typical mean value theorem argument
320:59 - you know that this number exists
321:02 - but you don't know what it is right all
321:03 - you know that it exists you know roughly
321:05 - where it's located but you don't know it
321:07 - exactly
321:08 - so what you're doing with taylor's
321:10 - theorem is you're not trying to compute
321:12 - this error
321:13 - this remainder term exactly because of
321:14 - course if you could do it exactly you
321:16 - would know the exact value
321:17 - that's not the point the point is to get
321:20 - some measure of how
321:21 - big this thing can get right when you're
321:24 - dealing with
321:24 - error when you're trying to estimate
321:26 - error right you want a
321:28 - maximum error you want an upper bound
321:30 - right so you want to be able to say look
321:32 - i know that my answer is off by a
321:34 - certain amount and i know that that
321:35 - amount can't be any bigger than this
321:38 - right if it turns out that your error is
321:40 - actually less
321:41 - than what you budgeted for nobody's
321:43 - going to complain right you did better
321:45 - than you
321:46 - than you advertised right you're only
321:48 - going to be in trouble
321:49 - if you advertise that you can do things
321:51 - within a certain error
321:52 - and then it turns out that you're you're
321:54 - much higher than that then you're going
321:55 - to get yourself in trouble
321:57 - so typically what you want to do here is
321:59 - you want to look for what is the biggest
322:02 - value that i can
322:05 - get for this
322:09 - function and we want to look i guess
322:10 - that absolute value right
322:12 - absolute value of this derivative
322:16 - okay and we take that absolute value
322:21 - you know over this interval i
322:26 - we divide by n plus 1 factorial
322:30 - and we multiply by the absolute value of
322:34 - x minus c taken to the n plus first
322:37 - power
322:38 - all right so there's a few things that
322:40 - you realize with this one is that if x
322:42 - is
322:43 - fairly close to c and in particular if
322:45 - the difference between x and c
322:46 - is less than one then
322:49 - this is going to get smaller as n gets
322:52 - bigger
322:53 - right so just being within one
322:56 - of the center of your polynomial is is
322:58 - going to give you some control
323:00 - over this remainder right so staying
323:02 - within a distance of 1 is going to work
323:04 - that's why we saw with like the natural
323:05 - logarithm
323:07 - as long as long as you know we did the
323:08 - log natural log we did the taylor
323:10 - polynomial centered at one
323:11 - and between zero and two we did okay
323:15 - but once we went past two once that
323:17 - difference was bigger than one
323:19 - we had a really bad estimate it wasn't
323:21 - good anymore okay
323:23 - because as soon as this difference is
323:24 - bigger than one it's going to start
323:26 - growing with n right of course it's not
323:30 - going to grow as fast as this factorial
323:32 - so what you're looking for is you're
323:34 - looking for you know making sure that
323:36 - overall
323:37 - this thing is getting smaller than gets
323:39 - bigger and
323:40 - indeed it will right for pretty much
323:43 - any reasonably behaved function is going
323:45 - to get smaller than gets bigger right if
323:46 - you're if you're looking at this in the
323:48 - context of sequences in series
323:50 - right your taylor
323:53 - series is going to have some radius of
323:55 - convergence and as long as you stay
323:56 - within that radius
323:57 - you know that this remainder is going to
323:59 - go to 0
324:00 - as n goes to infinity okay
324:04 - but if you're just working with
324:05 - polynomials you're doing polynomial
324:07 - approximations
324:08 - then you don't care that it's going to
324:10 - eventually go to infinity right
324:12 - like if if you have to go out to like
324:14 - you know billions or
324:15 - trillions before you start getting a
324:17 - small enough value that's not very
324:18 - practical if you're using this to
324:19 - approximate functions right
324:22 - you want to know that by the time you
324:23 - get to like n equals 10 or 20
324:26 - this remainder is small enough right you
324:29 - want things to get
324:30 - small relatively quickly otherwise you
324:33 - might
324:34 - be relying on a lot more computational
324:36 - power than you want
324:37 - okay so we're gonna see how this formula
324:40 - is used in the next few videos so we'll
324:41 - do a couple of examples
324:43 - um and then we're gonna move on to the
324:44 - next topic
324:50 - all right so let's look at an example we
324:53 - we looked at this example earlier the
324:55 - the natural logarithm we
324:57 - we use this degree 6 taylor polynomial
324:59 - to approximate
325:01 - the values of you know so we did this
325:04 - for
325:07 - the natural log of 1.5
325:10 - and we did it for the natural log of 2.
325:13 - and we found that the approximation was
325:15 - not too bad for
325:16 - 1.5 it wasn't very good at all for
325:19 - natural log of 2
325:20 - right so now we want to kind of look
325:23 - into this remainder and try to
325:24 - understand what's going on
325:26 - so if we were to calculate the seventh
325:30 - derivative
325:32 - of x you would find that you get minus
325:35 - 6 factorial
325:39 - over x to the 7. okay
325:42 - and if we want to center
325:46 - at 1 right we probably want to use we
325:50 - need an interval that contains
325:53 - the center and it needs to contain the
325:55 - point that we want to evaluate so maybe
325:56 - we move like 0.1
325:58 - either side right so maybe we go like
326:01 - 0.9 to 1.6
326:07 - right and
326:12 - you could you know in in effect if you
326:14 - wanted to you could probably go with
326:15 - the interval from 1 to 1.5 because
326:19 - this value of t in the remainder formula
326:22 - that you get
326:23 - from taylor's theorem generally it's
326:26 - safe to assume that it's somewhere in
326:28 - between these two values so somewhere
326:30 - between 1
326:30 - and 1.5 but
326:34 - uh let's go with 0.9 let's see where
326:36 - that gets us right let's let's
326:37 - like is it you know if if we get an
326:39 - error estimate that's too big
326:41 - that's all right that just means we're
326:42 - being a little bit more conservative
326:44 - right
326:44 - that's better than than trying to come
326:46 - up with an error estimate that's
326:48 - smaller so you make yourself look good
326:50 - but then it turns out that maybe you had
326:51 - a bit too small and your error estimate
326:53 - is not actually
326:55 - as accurate as you thought okay so
326:58 - if we if we use this interval and
327:03 - we want the maximum
327:07 - of the absolute value of the seventh
327:09 - derivative
327:12 - for for t in this interval let's call it
327:16 - i
327:18 - right we say well i want to make this
327:21 - thing as big as possible
327:22 - for t in this interval and well
327:26 - x is in the denominator right so if we
327:28 - if we have some reciprocal power of x
327:30 - and we want to make this thing big we
327:31 - should take x
327:32 - as small as possible uh that means we
327:34 - should take x to be 0.9
327:37 - all right we're taking absolute value so
327:39 - we lose the minus sign
327:40 - so we have 6 factorial over 0.9
327:45 - to the 7. and if you
327:48 - put that through your calculator you
327:50 - find that this comes out to
327:52 - be about 1506
327:55 - okay all right
327:59 - if you um if you decided that you wanted
328:02 - to do
328:05 - just t equals 1 right if we went from 1
328:08 - to 1.5
328:12 - you'd get 720
328:15 - which is 6 factorial right so our
328:18 - estimate here is about twice as big
328:20 - all right you think 0.9 is pretty close
328:23 - to one right but once you
328:24 - raise it to a high enough power it
328:26 - definitely has an effect
328:28 - okay so we have this this maximum
328:32 - and so now we know that um if we're if
328:34 - we're interested in the error
328:36 - right our error
328:39 - is going to be well
328:42 - it's going to be given by
328:45 - the remainder at
328:49 - 1.5 and we want the absolute value
328:53 - so we take the absolute value and that
328:55 - remainder is going to be less than or
328:57 - equal
328:57 - to so we have this
329:00 - maximum here and we've just worked out
329:02 - that you know the biggest that we can
329:04 - get
329:05 - on the interval we've chosen is
329:10 - 1506 we divide by
329:14 - 7 factorial and we should actually put
329:16 - in this is our 6 right
329:17 - our 6. so for n equal to 6 we divide by
329:21 - 7 factorial
329:24 - okay and then
329:28 - x minus c c is 1 x is 1.5
329:32 - 1.5 minus 1 gives us 0.5 or one half
329:37 - raised to the seventh power right so
329:40 - that 0.5 to the seventh power that's
329:42 - going to help make sure the error is not
329:44 - too big here right because
329:46 - you know that's that's one over two to
329:48 - the seventh that's
329:49 - getting to a reasonably small number
329:51 - that's one over a thousand right
329:53 - so we get to here and again
329:57 - you can punch this into your calculator
330:01 - by the way for when you're doing these
330:02 - error estimates it's nice to have a you
330:04 - know a decent calculator or even a
330:06 - spreadsheet handy to run the numbers
330:08 - right often in some situations you're
330:11 - plugging in various values of n to
330:13 - figure out which one works and so it's
330:14 - nice to be able to just generate them
330:16 - all
330:16 - and use a spreadsheet something like
330:18 - that so if you punch this through
330:21 - you get that this is something like
330:24 - 0.002 3
330:26 - right and so what that tells you
330:30 - is that the estimate you get for the
330:33 - natural log of 1.5
330:34 - right because the error is less than 5
330:37 - in this spot you know that you're good
330:41 - to two
330:45 - decimal places right
330:48 - because whatever value you got
330:52 - you know you get up to the second
330:53 - decimal place in the third decimal place
330:55 - you're off by you know plus or minus 0.2
330:58 - um up to rounding that's not enough to
331:00 - shift what you've got in the second
331:01 - decimal place
331:02 - so you're you're fairly happy with that
331:05 - right
331:06 - now if we had gone with
331:10 - the natural log of 2 instead
331:13 - right so then maybe we're going with
331:17 - 0.9 up to maybe 2.1 something like that
331:21 - well actually the only thing that
331:23 - changes
331:27 - the minimum is still going to be down
331:29 - here 0 or the maximum value is still
331:30 - going to be down here 0.9 right
331:32 - so you're still going to have that that
331:35 - 1506
331:38 - over 7 factorial there but now
331:41 - your x minus c is going to be 2 minus 1.
331:43 - it's 1
331:45 - to the 7th power right and and so that
331:48 - that
331:48 - this doesn't contribute right it's just
331:50 - 1 to the 7th so that's not going to help
331:52 - shrink the remainder the only thing that
331:54 - really helps shrink the remainder here
331:56 - is that 7
331:56 - factorial right and
332:00 - you can see that this is this is not
332:01 - going to be very good at all right so 7
332:03 - factorial
332:04 - is is what like um
332:08 - so seven times it's around five thousand
332:10 - right
332:11 - um so so this is yeah
332:14 - this is around fifteen hundred
332:18 - over five thousand something like that
332:21 - right
332:21 - um so it's less than one but it's bigger
332:25 - than point one
332:26 - so it's it's it's not as good
332:29 - right it's certainly not as good anymore
332:32 - i guess it's three thousand over over
332:34 - ten thousand so uh you know so somewhere
332:36 - around zero point three
332:38 - right which tells you that your answer
332:40 - is
332:41 - you don't necessarily even have the
332:43 - first decimal place right
332:44 - you've got the ones digit okay but
332:46 - that's about it
332:48 - so so here's where you can you can see
332:50 - that this is this is not going to help
332:52 - right
332:52 - and roughly roughly
332:57 - if you kind of play around with this if
332:58 - you think of where this came from right
333:00 - if you go to a higher degree what you're
333:02 - going to have is
333:04 - is the remainder is going to be more or
333:05 - less that
333:07 - that 0.9 factor if you want
333:10 - right you can creep closer to one if you
333:13 - want
333:14 - to kind of get it a bit better but but
333:17 - then even even
333:17 - even if you went with even if you went
333:19 - with one with with t equal to one your
333:22 - best case
333:25 - is going to be still n factorial
333:30 - over n plus 1 factorial which is
333:33 - which is 1 over n plus 1 right
333:38 - so that tells you that you know to get
333:40 - even the first decimal place
333:42 - you're going to need like 10 terms to
333:43 - get the second decimal place you're
333:44 - going to need like 100 terms right
333:46 - three decimal places you need like a
333:48 - thousand terms um
333:50 - so if you're trying to approximate you
333:52 - know log of two this is probably not how
333:56 - you want to do it
334:02 - all right let's look at another example
334:05 - now this is one that
334:07 - you probably shouldn't try to do by hand
334:09 - chances are you want to have a
334:11 - the very least scientific calculator
334:13 - with you
334:14 - even better would be a spreadsheet i'll
334:17 - try to explain why as we get there
334:19 - okay so the the goal here is
334:22 - we want to approximate the cosine
334:24 - function with the maclaurin polynomial
334:26 - and we want to figure out what is the
334:30 - smallest degree that we need if we want
334:34 - to make sure
334:35 - that our approximation it has a certain
334:37 - degree of accuracy
334:39 - when we are approximating cosine of two
334:42 - right
334:43 - so we know that our maclaurin polynomial
334:47 - for cos
334:49 - okay if you work through this example
334:52 - it looks something like this 1 minus
334:56 - x squared over 2 factorial x to the 4
335:00 - or 4 factorial x to the 6
335:04 - over 6 factorial x to the 8th
335:08 - over 8 factorial x to the 10 over 10
335:13 - factorial
335:14 - and so on up to up to whatever you know
335:19 - depending on the degree how far you want
335:20 - to go okay
335:23 - so so that's what the co the taylor
335:25 - polynomial for cosine looks like
335:27 - maclaurin polynomial we're centering at
335:28 - zero
335:30 - we want to figure out how many of these
335:31 - terms do we need to include to get this
335:33 - degree of accuracy right so cos of 2
335:35 - we'd approximate with pn of 2 so we'd
335:38 - approximate with 1 minus 4 over 2
335:41 - factorial
335:42 - plus 16 over 4 factorial right minus 64
335:45 - over 6 factorial and so on
335:48 - we want to try and approximate this so
335:50 - again
335:52 - we rely on taylor's theorem
335:55 - and we say okay i know that that by
335:58 - taylor's theorem
336:02 - i know that the remainder
336:09 - is always going to be less than or equal
336:14 - to this maximum value for
336:19 - the n plus first derivative
336:23 - at some t
336:26 - over n plus 1 factorial right and then
336:31 - this is just simply going to be absolute
336:33 - value of x
336:36 - to the n right because we're we're
336:38 - centering at zero so
336:39 - x minus c just becomes x
336:43 - all right now one of the things that
336:46 - that
336:46 - we know here right is is we know what
336:48 - these derivatives are
336:50 - now of course it depends on n but
336:54 - we know that these these derivatives
336:56 - they cycle right
336:57 - we're going to take the first derivative
336:58 - we get negative sign then negative cos
337:00 - then positive sign then positive cos and
337:02 - then
337:03 - repeat right so every every four
337:05 - derivatives it repeats
337:07 - so we know um well the absolute value
337:10 - eats that plus or minus right
337:12 - so this is either going to be cos t or
337:14 - sine t
337:16 - once you take the absolute value okay
337:19 - and and i haven't written down an
337:21 - interval here i guess we go with
337:22 - something like
337:24 - you know from minus 0.1 up to 2.1
337:28 - something like that
337:29 - but it doesn't matter because we know
337:32 - that
337:34 - what do we know about these trig
337:37 - functions
337:38 - we know that the absolute value of
337:41 - cos is always less than or equal to one
337:45 - and we know that the same thing is true
337:49 - for sine right it doesn't matter what t
337:52 - is
337:53 - these can never be bigger than one this
337:55 - is the property of sine and cosine
337:57 - functions
337:58 - so that means that
338:01 - regardless of the inter interval that
338:03 - we're working on this maximum can't be
338:05 - bigger than one
338:06 - so the remainder
338:09 - if we're doing this at 2
338:14 - has to be less than or equal to 1
338:20 - over n plus 1 factorial
338:23 - times 2
338:26 - oops sorry to the n plus
338:29 - 1. okay
338:32 - and and now the rest is kind of trial
338:35 - and error computational work plugging in
338:37 - values of
338:38 - n until you find the first n that gives
338:40 - you a small enough
338:42 - value right we want it to be less than
338:44 - 0.001
338:46 - this is where a spreadsheet is really
338:48 - great because all
338:50 - you do is you take one column and you
338:52 - label it
338:53 - n and you have another column that you
338:56 - label i don't know
338:58 - rn or error or something right and
339:03 - you just fill the values down in fact i
339:06 - think if you put one and you drag it
339:07 - will fill the rest in automatically
339:09 - on a decent spreadsheet right
339:12 - and and then the rn you say okay so what
339:15 - is what is rn you can you can kind of
339:17 - program this into your spreadsheet right
339:19 - you say
339:20 - it's going to be
339:24 - 2 to the power of
339:28 - you know so if this is
339:31 - if this is in like cell maybe this is
339:34 - like a two here
339:35 - right so you're like you're like okay so
339:37 - it's going to be 2 to the power
339:39 - of of a2
339:42 - divide by um
339:46 - oh plus one right because we add one to
339:49 - the exponent
339:50 - divide by like factorial
339:53 - a2 plus one and then you just copy it
339:56 - down right and when you copy in the
339:58 - spreadsheet it's going to increment this
339:59 - as you copy it down
340:00 - and that's just going to do those
340:02 - calculations for you automatically so
340:03 - you don't have to do it it's great
340:05 - right but of course you can you can do
340:08 - these
340:08 - right you can start working them out so
340:11 - when n is equal to one
340:14 - you get 2 squared over 2 factorial 4
340:17 - over 2
340:18 - you get 2 well that's definitely not
340:20 - going to work
340:21 - so you go to n equals 2 2
340:24 - cubed or 3 factorial 8 over six four
340:27 - thirds
340:28 - uh it's about one point three ish still
340:32 - too big
340:32 - you go to n a equals three two to the
340:35 - four
340:36 - sixteen over four factorial just twenty
340:38 - four that's three quarters so you're at
340:40 - you're at 0.75 right
340:43 - and and you keep you keep working your
340:46 - way down you keep doing these so you go
340:48 - okay n equals 4 uh 32
340:52 - over over 5 factorial so 32 over over
340:55 - 120
340:57 - and and you get this is about 0.267
341:00 - right and then you go to 5 so 5 plus 1
341:03 - is 6.
341:04 - 64 over 6 factorial so
341:07 - 64 over 720 and you get something like
341:10 - i've got them
341:11 - written then it was written down over
341:12 - there i don't remember these this is now
341:17 - 0.084
341:18 - getting better right so you keep going
341:22 - for n equals six point zero two five
341:25 - right
341:26 - um six plus one you get two to the seven
341:29 - so we're at like 128
341:33 - seven factorial is getting you know
341:36 - reading there is like 5040 right but
341:38 - still okay
341:40 - and and now one of the things that
341:42 - you'll notice as you play around these
341:44 - examples is
341:45 - factorials they grow much faster than
341:47 - exponentials right because
341:49 - here you're just multiplying by two each
341:51 - time here the next thing you multiply is
341:53 - bigger than the previous thing
341:55 - all right so you keep going and the next
341:57 - one you get
341:59 - you're doing like 256 divided by like 40
342:02 - 000 and
342:02 - something and you get 0.0
342:07 - and then you try eight and you got 512
342:13 - for your for your two to the nine and
342:15 - then you're dividing by nine factorial
342:17 - which is like 362
342:19 - 000 something and you get 0.0014
342:24 - almost there but not quite right so you
342:27 - say oh we got to go to 9.
342:29 - so we got n equals 9 and for n equals
342:33 - 9 right you get 2 to the 10
342:37 - over 10 factorial
342:41 - okay so so 2 to the 10 is like
342:45 - is is a thousand thousand twenty four
342:50 - ten factorial is i don't know it's like
342:52 - three three million
342:54 - something right
342:57 - three million in something and and and
343:00 - you do get something which is
343:02 - indeed less than 0.01
343:05 - so you're like yes i guess i got to go
343:07 - to degree 9.
343:09 - but that's not quite the end of the
343:11 - story because hey here's our
343:13 - here's our polynomial right um
343:17 - the coefficient of x to the nine in the
343:19 - maclaurin polynomial for cos
343:22 - is zero okay so right
343:26 - i can actually stop at eight because the
343:27 - degree nine maclaurin polynomial is the
343:30 - same
343:30 - as the degree 8 maclaurin polynomial
343:33 - right because when you go to degree 9
343:34 - you're adding 0.
343:35 - nothing changes so in fact um
343:44 - n equals eight will do
343:47 - right and and then maybe you're
343:49 - concerned you're like hey but you know
343:51 - this number was too big like that
343:52 - doesn't make sense
343:53 - how can how can you know we get this
343:56 - much smaller number for n equals 9
343:58 - than we have here but they're the same
344:00 - polynomial like shouldn't the error be
344:02 - the same
344:03 - and of course the error is the same
344:05 - because remember
344:07 - we don't know this value precisely we're
344:09 - always just going for the worst case
344:10 - scenario was the biggest that it could
344:12 - be
344:13 - right these numbers here are bigger than
344:15 - the actual error
344:16 - right so typically once you get
344:18 - something that's close to the area
344:20 - you're looking for because you're
344:21 - overestimating
344:22 - you're probably already good at n equals
344:24 - eight but sometimes you add one more
344:26 - term
344:27 - just to be safe

Cleaned transcript:

okay so we're moving on now to sequences and series this chapter is a little bit different in flavor from a lot of the stuff that you've seen previously for sequences it's still going to remind you a lot of kind of limits at infinity like you did way back in chapter one right it's going to be very similar to that once we get into series the closest thing that we've seen so far that's kind of comparable to what we're doing when we deal with series is probably improper integrals where we're not necessarily just trying to do a calculation get an answer out at the end um we're more interested in whether something actually makes sense so as a sequence is just going to be a list of numbers a series is going to be what you get if you add up all the numbers in a list and by list here we don't need a finite list we mean a list that goes on forever and of course if you are adding up infinitely many terms then there's a good possibility that they don't add up to anything right um they they make kind of you know the values might jump around and never settle down to a value they probably add up to some infinite value if they do add up and so it's it's interesting just to figure out when can we actually add these numbers up and get something sensible right um so we're more interested in almost like existence questions now rather than computational questions and so that gets uh that gets a little bit tricky sometimes right it's a different philosophy um than what you've been dealing with so far um but we start with sequences we can give a definition okay so there are a number of ways of defining a sequence but the kind of definition that most people tend to give is the following so a sequence and i guess we should say you know we could consider sequences of other numbers we could consider we could consider sequences of complex numbers we even consider sequences of functions matrices vectors there's lots of things that you can put into a sequence but right now we're just looking at sequences of real numbers okay so a sequence is just going to be a function f so i'm going to write it like this it's a function f from the natural numbers to the real numbers this is one way to write it um so what do i mean here okay so what exactly do we mean by this notation if you haven't seen it before well what i mean is it's a function whose domain so here n is the domain the domain of our function will be the natural numbers okay so big n here stands for the natural numbers and depending on who you ask sometimes the natural numbers include zero sometimes they don't um we'll we'll allow zero because sometimes this can we need to have a sequence start at zero so we're looking at zero one two three four and so on right um and so the idea is basically for every natural number right we can write those out in a list and for every natural number on the on the list we write down a corresponding real number right so what we're going to have is something like say a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 and so on right so we might we might write it something like that so in other words we could say that f of a natural number is a sub n so a n here is a real number okay so there's lots of things you can think of here i mean you can just write down any list of real numbers and that's going to give you a sequence um probably you want a sequence that follows some sort of pattern right so we might look for something like know we might have something like this our sequence might be something like 0 1 4 9 16 25 and so on and maybe by now you've guessed the pattern right so in other words we can say here that f of n is just n squared typically we don't really bother with function notation for sequences so more likely how you're going to see this written it would be simply as a n is n squared okay so any any function that you can think of you can write down like this and you can you can get a sequence here's one that's uh that's sort of an interesting one we could do this one a n is cosine of n times pi so what does that give me as a sequence well it gives me cosine of 0 cosine of pi cosine of 2 pi cosine of 3 pi and so on but we we know the value of cosine at multiples of pi cosine of 0 is 1 cosine of pi is 1 cosine of 2 pi is 1 again cosine of 3 pi is minus 1. so you get a sequence it just alternates back and forth 1 minus 1 1 minus 1. another way that you could write this and this is typically how you would express this would be to say well it's minus 1 to the n right now normally powers of negative numbers are kind of tricky things we don't normally like to put negatives into exponential functions you know we don't like to have a negative base for an exponential because square roots for example of negatives don't make sense in fact you know most real number exponents if you have a negative base don't make any sense because for a real number base right we really you know it's one thing to kind of keep in mind is to remember that you know when we define a to the x right normally we mean e to the x times the natural log of a so if a is negative this doesn't make any sense right um but we can make sense of integer powers of any number right because this just means multiply minus one n times so that works right it's n minus signs you're just counting how many minus signs you have and of course if you have an even number of minus signs you have plus one if you have an odd number of minus signs you have minus one so you can do things like that right sequences that you might have encountered in a high school course would be things like arithmetic and geometric sequences where you just add the same thing every time or you multiply by the same thing every time right so something like you know adding just counting by 2 0 2 four six eight or or maybe you start at one and you add five every time so you have one and five or sorry one six eleven sixteen so on something like that right these are arithmetic sequences multiplying by two like we can do you know 2 4 8 16 32 64 right geometric sequences we can make sense of those you can also look at what are called recursive sequences and we'll we'll encounter a few of these and this is something that you know is not a thing you can do with with functions of a real variable right so if the domain is real numbers this doesn't make any sense but if your domain is the natural number you can consider these socalled recursive definitions so you can look at something like maybe we need to define a sub 0 to be two and we say okay i'm gonna define a n to be let's say three times a n minus one plus one for each n bigger than or equal to 1. and then you can kind of work out what that's going to be right so you start off with a 0 is equal to 2 right a 1 will be three times a zero so three times two plus one so i get seven right a two is going to be three times a one seven plus 1 so i get 22 and so on i can keep going you know adding more and more terms into that sequence generating those terms uh famous one that you might have seen fibonacci sequence right so the fibonacci sequence actually starts with two initial terms a0 is 1 a one is one and a n is just the sum of the two previous ones n minus one n minus two for each n bigger than or equal to 2. and so you can play around and you can see what sort of terms you generate there you get 1 1 and then 1 plus 1 gives me 2. 1 plus 2 gives me 3. 2 plus 3 is 5. 3 plus 5 is 8. 13 21 34 and so on so this is a very famous sequence it's studied in a number of different scenarios there's even a quarterly journal devoted just to this sequence believe it or not so there's lots of interesting things you can do with sequences and there's a lot of stuff you can study with sequences and it's it's kind of a gateway into studying calculus more abstractly getting into analysis right the theoretical underpinnings of of calculus a lot of things can be understood in terms of sequences limits in particular can be understood in terms of sequences we're just getting our our toes wet here we're just getting started trying to understand how things work um we spend a little bit of time on sequences and then we're going to dive right into series okay so our first example just asks us to generate the first few terms in a number of sequences written here on the board all right this curly bracket notation is the notation that's used in the apex calculus books for four sequences so we're thinking of this if you like as a set i think is the idea behind the notation other textbooks will will put round brackets around the terms in a sequence other books will will do things you might find brackets around the a n you might find no brackets at all notation tends to vary somewhat on these um as long as we get our point across maybe it doesn't matter how we write it let's try to be consistent so with this first one we have an exponential on top 3 to the n on the bottom we have this factorial so let me just remind you in case you've forgotten the factorial you probably encountered it back when you were looking at tailored polynomials if you did study tailored polynomials along with linear approximations back in the chapter on derivative approximations you might not have encountered them yet depending on the order in which you see the material factorial is just the product of the first n integers so it means one times two times three and so on up to n all right or another way to define it is we can define it like this now one thing that's kind of odd we do actually define zero factorial oddly enough zero factorial is defined to be one there are a number of ways to understand why zero factorial should be one that we are not going to necessarily get into right now one of the reasons simple reason is it is going to make some formulas work out a lot better for us later on once we get to taylor polynomials and taylor series okay so zero factorial is one um one factorial is is also one and then n factorial we just do n multiplied by n minus one factorial for each n bigger than or equal to 1. all right so 1 factorial is 1 times 0 factorial still 1 2 factorial is 1 times 2 times 1 factorial so you get 2. 3 factorial is 3 times 2 factorial so it's 3 times 2 times 1 you get 6 and so on right so with that in mind we come over here and 4 terms i guess we did the question doesn't say whether we should start at zero or one maybe we'll start at zero and we'll do five terms just to play it safe so we'll do n is equal to zero one two three 4 okay a sub n will be what will be 3 to the 0 over 0 factorial anything to the 0 is 1 so 3 to the 0 is 1 0 factorial we just said that's one okay i wish maybe equals is not the best thing to put here okay there's a1 sorry a0 a1 will be 3 to the 1 over 1 factorial so you get 3 a2 will be 3 to the 2 over 2 factorial so that's 9 over 2 okay a 3 will be 3 cubed over 3 factorial okay so that's 3 times 3 times 3 is 27. sometimes it's convenient to write things out like this because you can simplify a little bit cancel those threes it's also 9 over 2 okay and then 3 to the 4th over 4 we have 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 four times three times two times one we can cancel a couple of them that's going to come out to be 27 over eight all right um so one of the things you can see here is that initially the exponential is bigger right 9 is bigger than 2 27 is bigger than a but each time we we kind of proceed to the next step we're multiplying on the top again by 3 but the number we're multiplying by on the bottom is getting bigger each time so the factorial is going to grow faster than an exponential right and we're used to thinking of the exponential as this very fast growing thing factorials grow even faster right so eventually the denominator is going to win here and we expect that these terms should get smaller and smaller and smaller if we let things go on long enough okay but there's the first four or five terms if you like one three nine over two nine over two 27 over eight okay we can come to the next one so a zero will be four plus minus one to the zero that's five right a one will be four plus minus one to the one so that's four minus one we get three a two well we're gonna be back to minus one squared even power again so we get four plus one so five and you can kind of see what's going to happen here right a3 will be three a4 will be five and this sequence is just going to jump back and forth between five and three so five three five three five three five three for however long you want to go all right let's come to this last one you might be worried about the the fraction here with the minus 1 that seems like trouble but it's ok because you know whatever number n is remember n has to be a natural number so it's either even or odd if n is odd well then n plus one will be even so one of these two is always even so we divide by two we still get a whole number we're fine we can do minus one to an integer power that makes sense so ah we better not start at zero for this one right we can't divide by zero so this one is definitely going to start at one so we'll do a1 a2 a3 a4 we do have to pay attention to these things sometimes so a1 is going to be minus 1 to the let's see it'll be 1 times 2 divided by 2 minus 1 to the 1 over 1 squared so we just get 1 uh minus 1. sorry a2 we're going to get let's see it'll be 2 times 3 divide by we get 3 right and so that's minus 1 to the 3. on the bottom we have 2 squared 4 minus 1 over 4. a3 we're going to have 3 times 4 divided by 2. so 3 times 4 divided by 2. 12 divided by 2 minus 1 to the 6. okay over three squared nine so one over nine and finally a4 if n is equal to four we're gonna have four times five divided by two so we have 20 divided by two that's ten ten over two yeah sorry ten right twenty over two is ten so minus one to the ten it's even again over 4 squared 16 so we get 1 1 over 16 for that one and again we could keep going um here probably the main challenge is it seems like maybe it's a little bit hard to predict whether this thing is going to come out to be an even or an odd number as n goes on right the bottom we understand that's easy to understand um whether we should have plus one or minus one in the numerator we'd have to think a little bit about that if we wanted to continue this sequence on any further all right so next step is something certainly more challenging than the previous one so in the previous one we were given a formula and we just had to generate the sequence now we're we're given the first few terms in a sequence and we have to come up with a formula that generates those terms now one thing that's tricky here is you can't necessarily guarantee that your formula is correct right it might be that there are many different sequences that begin in the same way in fact online there's a database of sequences and you can go in and you can put the first few terms in into that database and ask it okay which sequences match the terms that i'm starting so we could go in we could go online we could find that website we could enter these and see what it predicts and maybe it only comes up with one answer maybe it comes up with more than one but we'll we'll try to see if we can find one that makes sense here right so in the first one we're just looking for a pattern 2 5 8 11 14 we say okay what do we see about these numbers well looks to me like we're going up by 3 every time right 2 plus 3 is 5. 5 plus 3 is 8 8 plus a 3 is 11. 11 plus 3 is 14 right so we can look at the differences we see that we're going up by three a lot of the time what you want to do is you want to look at things like what's the difference between terms right if i subtract them do i see a pattern in the differences or maybe maybe if i divide do i see a pattern in the in the quotients um so you try to look for any pattern any way you can come up with it you try to look for a pattern and you once you've got something that you think works take a guess at the formula see if your formula generates those terms right so in this case we see that we start at 2 and we go up by 3 each time so our guess is going to be that a n should be 2 plus so each time we go up by n we add 3 so that should just look like 3n right for n bigger than or equal to 0. and we guess that and then we check all right so let's do 0 1 2. you can check that i still do the first couple you can do the last couple all right n equals 0 i get 2. n is equal to 1 2 plus 3 i get 5. and it's equal to 2 i get 2 plus 6 i get 8. looks good right try the next one if i put n equals 3 9 plus 2 is 11 n equals 4 12 plus 2 14 works okay um so maybe there would have been other formulas that generate those first five terms but we've got one that it does the job so that works for us right and of course one of the reasons why we might want to come up with a formula like this is we might want to start looking at what's the longterm behavior right what can we say about this pattern for large n does the sequence have a limit as n goes to infinity these are the problems that we want to study soon so if we have something like this well we we need to have a formula like that if we're going to look at things like limits right okay so we look at the next one so one of the things that we might notice here is we're alternating signs each time right plus minus plus minus plus minus and so one of the things that you might guess for your formula is that if you see the alternating signs well maybe there's a minus 1 to the n in there right that's something that alternates sign so if we put that in there to deal with the minus signs then we can focus on the numbers without necessarily looking at the minus sign so now we have 2 5 10 17 26 37 and we see if we can get a pattern there all right well not as simple as the last one but again maybe we look at differences five minus two is three ten minus five five right seventeen minus ten seven so we look at the differences and we notice the differences are three five seven again ignoring the minus signs 26 minus 17 9 37 minus 26 11 ah those are odd numbers okay so it looks like we're we're going up by an odd number every time right so we should add an odd number start at 2 and we add an odd number so what does that look like um so we're going to start at 2 and we add an odd number so an odd number looks like two n plus one right every even number is just a multiple of two adding one gets me to an odd number all right and make sure that that's going to work for us we might have to shift things a little bit so if n is equal to 0 we get 2 good right if n is equal to 1 we get a minus 1 here that's going to be three plus two we get five minus five yeah if n is equal to two that becomes plus one that's gonna be five plus two is seven ah doesn't that doesn't quite work does it um no no no because that's just getting the odd number so what we want to do is we want to take the previous number and add a new odd number in so that's not quite working is it so it's not as simple as that it's it's going to be more like hmm how are we going to do it let's see we got to take that we got to add the previous one so we're actually doing is doing something like this minus 1 to the n and then we're going to do we have that 2 at the beginning and then we're going to do is going to be 3 plus 5 plus up to 2 n plus 1 something like that well that's not a great formula is it um does it work not really um oh but there's something that we might also notice yes there's another thing we might notice okay each of these numbers it's one bigger than a square okay now i noticed that because i happen to remember that there's a well maybe we should have noticed that right away but there is a formula that you can prove that says if you add up the first n odd numbers 2n plus 1 what you get is simply n squared right start at 1 1 is 1 squared 1 plus 3 is 2 squared 1 plus 3 plus 5 gets you to 9 which is 3 squared 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 9 gets you to 16 4 squared all right now the way you actually establish that as truth is using a technique called mathematical induction you do a proof by induction which is not something that you're probably going to learn in your calculus course you're going to see that maybe in an introduction to proof's course or whatever your first sort of proofbased course is you're probably going to run into proof by induction so what we actually want here is to realize huh what we really should have is this should be minus 1 to the n and then we should do n squared plus one that's going to work right one squared plus one two squared plus one three squared plus one fourth squared plus one five squared plus one six squared plus one does the job all right so that was a little bit trickier all right um this didn't work that gave us the wrong answer right that's just generating the odd numbers but those odd numbers are the differences they're not the actual terms in the sequence so you say no that didn't work we go to this one but that's not a very useful formula so we find a nice closed form and now we're happy okay getting there next one now the next one i can spot just because i've been working with these numbers i know these numbers i know where they come from so i can write down the answer right away you might not be able to write down the answer right away but we can start thinking about them and say okay what's happening here 1 1 nothing's happening there then we go to 2 then 6 and 24. okay so what's the difference you know how do these numbers compare two is twice as big as one six is three times as big as two 24 is four times as big as two right so we're doing times one times two times three times 4 24 times 5 gets me to 120 120 times 6 gets me to 720 well i know what these ones are this is simply the sequence of factorials okay remember we we said that 0 factorial is 1 right 1 factorial 2 3 4 factorial 5 6 factorial it's just the factorial sequence okay not so bad one more to go the video is running a little long so let's dive right in and see if we can answer this last one we should have split this into two halves five over two five over two fifteen over eight it looks okay at first you can't really see a pattern here right um two two eight four oh it drops way down and then 32 what's going on there um well one of the reasons why you can't see a pattern here is that we've reduced the fractions right so reducing the fractions is kind of hiding what's actually going on here five over two is the reduced form of ten over four five over four is the reduced form of 20 over 16. okay so if we don't reduce those fractions the numerators are going 5 10 15 20 25 is multiples of 5. all right and the denominators are going 2 4 8 16 32 those are powers of 2. okay so on top 5 n on the bottom 2 to the n and n is starting at 1. all right let's confirm that it works if n is equal to 1 we get 5 over 2. if n is equal to 2 we get 10 over 4 which is 5 over 2 and is equal to 3 15 over 8 and is equal to 4 20 over 16 works right we got it all right so in this next video we want to introduce the idea of the limit of a sequence we're going to look at limits before we move on to examples we need to introduce some terminology okay so definition comes first okay so we say that a sequence a n and the term that we use here is converge okay just like for improper integral so we're going to say that the sequence converges to a limit l okay and we might just say the limit is l and so we write this as limit n going to infinity so we only look at limits at infinity for for sequences limit of a n is equal to l if all right we're going to give the precise definition if for any positive epsilon there exists a natural number n such that for all n bigger than or equal to that n difference between a n and l is less than epsilon okay all right so the definition is a bit of a mouthful okay so the key word here is converge right or limit if you like here's our standard notation okay limit of the sequence is l so we get into this epsilon delta formulation again right for epsilon greater than zero there exists an n such that for every little n that's bigger than this fixed end right so here i think this is the variable this is some number um we have this inequality um visually this sort of makes sense okay so what we're really saying here when we say we have a limit think about things graphically right we can we can plot the terms in a sequence because we can remember that we can think of a sequence as just a real valued or you know it's a real valued function where the domain is just the natural numbers right so we can mark our natural numbers down and we have some value say l so l is going to be the limit let's say all right so let me just draw that line in y is equal to l okay and epsilon here think of epsilon as like an error right what we're saying is that you know the difference between terms in the sequence and the limit will be small okay so what we're saying is there for any epsilon so we can choose a large epsilon but typically we think of that as a small epsilon so here's l plus epsilon here's l minus epsilon right so we get this little strip of with two epsilon centered on l and then you start plotting the terms in your sequence right and so maybe the first one is down here like here's a1 right and maybe a2 is up here and maybe a3 is down here and a4 maybe it's up there okay a5 is here a6 is there a7 lands inside oh great but then suddenly a8 is out again but then a 9 is inside a 10 it's inside 11 is inside 12 is inside right so there's there's some value of n right here right so that once we hit there all the later terms in the sukin sequence are going to be uh within that strip and of course this is saying that the terms in the sequence they do have to get closer and closer and closer to l because if i shrink the strip right if i make epsilon smaller if i make this narrower well then i might have to go further out before i find an end that works but we're saying if we say that we have a limit of l we're saying that no matter how thin i make this strip i can eventually go far enough out so that everything stays inside the strip right thinner strip bigger n but i can always do it right eventually i'll always get inside this trick so that's what it means to have a limit in this sense all right so in the last video we introduced the notion of convergence of a sequence right so this is just whether or not um the limit of a sequence exists and gives a finite value as n goes to infinity right so if you calculate the limit and the limit is either infinite or the limit doesn't exist then we would say the sequence diverges if so a convergence sequence is going to be one where we actually get a number for the limit so that's what we're looking for here okay now one of the things that is worth pointing out is that if your sequence um if your sequence is you know given by f of n where we know how to do this limit the limit as x goes to infinity so if we replace n with a real variable x and we calculate that limit and it exists well then the limit as n goes to infinity of a n will agree right now that doesn't always work because there will be situations where this limit doesn't exist but we can still make sense of the of the sequence because there might be functions that you know for a real variable they're jumping around all over the place but you put in only integer values and things settle down but this does give a handy tool especially for something like this because we know how to do a limit like this right we know that if we were doing the limit as n goes to infinity of three n squared minus two n plus one over over n squared minus a thousand right if we had x instead of n here then this is the problem that you did way back in the very first chapter on limits right very beginning of calc 1. we'd say okay it's quadratic top and bottom right if the degree is the same on top and bottom we look at the ratio of the coefficients three over one we know that limit is three so it converges it converges to three so that's that's simple enough right it's good enough to do that i mean you should say something right say why is it three well because it's the same degree top and bottom and that's a rule that we learn right um if you feel like that's too easy and you want to show a little bit of work well you could always do that same trick that we did with the real variable divide everything by n squared right so you could write this as the limit n going to infinity of 3 minus 2 over n plus 1 over n squared 1 minus 1 000 over n squared and you can use the limit definition you can give an epsilon n proof to show that the limit of anything any constant over n that limit is going to be zero same with n squared n cubed you know constant over any um positive power of n is going to go to zero so we get three over one in the limit we get 3. great you move on to something like this well this if you plot it it's an interesting thing because if you plot this function if you plus the sequence right i mean we know what it is a function of x so you get this cosine wave it oscillates back and forth um but if you start plotting the points for the sequence the textbook has the scatter plot shows you what it looks like well then it's a little bit different right because you're only plugging in the integer values so you're i mean you're getting points that are on that cosine wave right but only only at the integer values and and the cosine wave you know if we're just doing cos n it's not oscillating with an integer period right the period is a multiple of pi so things are going to actually jump around a whole lot it's going to be kind of funny looking but nonetheless we know for sure that this is not going to exist right so this limit diverges so this sequence diverges i mean we need to give a reason for it but one of the things we know is that well we know the limit as x goes to infinity of cos x that doesn't exist right because it oscillates back and forth between 1 and 1 right we hit those values in fairly many times now we're not actually going to hit minus 1 or 1 for this because we're not actually going to get to you know a multiple of pi over to multiple of pi right um we don't get to a multiple of pi um but we get close right um so somewhere along the way you know n's going to infinity we have all the integers in there so somewhere along the way we have we have you know three all right we have 31 314 right 3100 you know uh 41 we have 3 100 or 31 000 415 you know we we have these numbers which are very close to to multiples of pi right we can kind of add more digits of pi but before the decimal right so this is this is close to 100 pi thousand pi 10 000 pi right those are all even multiples of pi and then we could also consider you know odd multiples we can shift things a bit so we can get lots of values that are close to one we can also generate values that are close to minus one we can get all kinds of things in between right um so it's never going to get close to any value it's going to keep jumping back and forth forever so that's no good okay now you come to this last one and there are a couple of ways that you can tackle something like that one would be to to go to the to the definition or i mean you want to probably play around a little bit right and you say okay well the terms in the sequence are going to be i'm going to have like minus 1 then i'm going to have a half then minus a third plus a quarter minus a fifth plus plus 1 6 right and so if you start plotting them you can kind of see that yeah it looks like they're going to zero because you have well one way to think about it is that you have we draw in here's y is 1 over x down here we can put in y is minus 1 over x right and and so the the terms in the sequence are going to be you know i guess the first one would be down here and then up here and then here and then there and there and then there right so you can see that they're getting closer and closer to zero the trouble is we can't actually we can't write this as a function of x as it is minus one to the x makes no sense at least working with real numbers it makes no sense now one of the things you can do is something that we observed initially here is a function that actually agrees with this sequence on the integers cos pi x over x right because multiples of pi right integer multiples of pi when you plug them into cosine you get either one or minus one like we were just talking about so there's a function of x that agrees with our sequence so at every integer and if you take the limit of that well we we saw that again but go back to calc 1 methods squeeze theorem essentially is going to tell you right because the absolute value of this f of x right well absolute value of cosine is less than or equal to 1. so this is less than or equal to one over x in absolute value and so the function is sandwiched in between minus one over x on the one hand and plus one over x on the other hand we know that those both go to zero so this has to go to zero as well actually that squeeze theorem argument you can use that for for sequences as well that's perfectly valid right we can just say well look it's true that minus one over n is less than or equal to c n less than equal to one over n for all for all n and we know that that goes to zero we know that that goes to zero squeeze theorem says that this has to go to zero as well so we know that the limit as n goes to infinity of cn is zero so it converges and it converges to zero all right so here are a couple of theoretical results on limits that can come in handy the first one we we just actually employed towards the end of the the last problem the last example where we noted you know we had this remember what the problem was we were trying to do the following limit right we said okay we have this limit n goes to infinity of minus 1 to the n over n and we said well you know what we'd sure like to just sort of argue that since minus one to the n just goes back and forth between minus one and one it's bounded n is going to infinity so this is this is a number that's always either one or minus one dividing by larger and larger numbers that things are getting closer and closer to zero um we found a couple ways to kind of argue that yes that limit does indeed have to go to zero but here is is one theorem that kind of lets you do it quite quickly right if if a sequence goes to zero an absolute value then the sequence has to go to zero and it is exactly that same sort of squeeze theorem type argument that we gave towards the end of that solution we said okay well this just works because any any number is well it's either equal to its absolute value or the negative of its absolute value right so it's it's in between those two um and so if this goes to zero in the limit and that goes to zero in the limit well then this one in the middle has to go to zero as well right or if you like it's you could use the the definition right you could go back to that epsilon n definition and you say okay um well um we let epsilon be given and we can say that since since the limit as n goes to infinity of the absolute value of n is 0 we can choose n such that the absolute value of the absolute value of a n minus zero is less than epsilon right um but then you know just think what this is well i mean minus zero that's just so it's the absolute value of the absolute value but that's just the absolute value of a n right which is the absolute value of a n minus zero right so that same n is going to work here because really the the absolute value of a n is the same as the absolute value of the absolute value of a n right so that just get it right away with really no effort limit properties work the same for sequences as they do for functions right um if you have two convergent sequences with finite limits right then the limit of the sum is going to be the sum of the limits if there's a constant you can pull it outside the limit right so you can think of this as this is just k times the limit of a n right a limit of a product is product of the limits limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits well as long as the limit of b n is not zero right so you can do all of these things um we won't necessarily go through the proofs in in a calculus class um again you might see them in another course uh maybe in an analysis course um probably just in a basic like introduced proofs course you're going to see something like that um the the proof for the limit of a sum is a is a standard one that you're probably going to encounter and it's a nice one to see um go through the details i don't know if we want to do it here we only have so much board space we don't want to make the video too long the let me i'll just kind of explain the idea of the proof for the limit of a of a sum right so for the limit of a sum right uh you're given so epsilon is given right and you're trying to make this difference smaller than epsilon right but i can rewrite this as a n minus l b n minus m just rearrange things okay and and if you redo and by the way if you're doing the difference you'd have a minus sign here instead of a plus sign and the next step actually is the same you have the triangle inequality the absolute value of a sum is always less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values all right so you can get something like that and so i'm not going to write up all the details of the proof obviously i don't have broom but essentially the way you would proceed is you say okay i'm given the epsilon now i got to choose my n and you say okay well look um i know that this limit exists right that limit is l right so a n converges to l so i know that from here i can choose i can choose some n1 that makes this absolute value less than epsilon i can choose an n 2 that makes this difference less than epsilon right because i know that those two sequences converge and then what i do is i choose i choose n to be whichever of those is bigger and one and two right so that means that if little n is is bigger than big n well then it's bigger than both of these and so i know that that difference is less than epsilon i know that that difference is less than epsilon oh except you know then that the sum is going to be 2 epsilon and that's not quite what we want so we say hey actually we can choose these so that this will be less than not just epsilon but that'll be less than epsilon over 2. and we choose so this is less than epsilon over 2. and so then when we add them together we get that epsilon right that's a that's a standard kind of argument that you use for doing epsilon delta proofs with sums or differences all right so in this example we're going to work with some of the limit properties for limits of sequences that we saw in the previous video we're given three sequences we're told their limits okay um some of these i mean we can work these out if we absolutely had to but they're they're given to us right um here you know if we wrote all of these as functions of x and we think about taking the limit as x goes to infinity we know how to handle this it's just a rational function degree is bigger on the bottom so yes the limit should be zero um this one here um this is interesting right that is like base e from like the natural exponential function right that's euler's number um some people will actually take this as the definition of e which is interesting but you can show that the limit is equal to e using um using l'hopital's rule right techniques for indeterminate forms because this is something of the form one to the infinity that's one of the forms that we know how to handle finally here this one's a little bit tricky if you try to take the limit well let's see n is going to infinity five over n is going to zero so it's like infinity times zero um oh but if we if we wrote this as sine five over n you know if we think of this as sine 5 over n divided by 1 over n oh now it's a 0 over 0 limit and in fact if we put a 5 here and a 5 here well now this is like a sine theta over theta limit right we know that limit as you know if n goes to infinity five over n goes to zero so we know that this this limit here is is one so five times one so that makes sense okay so we have these limits now we want to calculate these results over here and the point is once we know the value of the limits we don't need to get into the details we just need to apply limit properties so this one here well we know that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits so we can write limit as n goes to infinity of a n plus the limit as n goes to infinity of b n and the first limit is zero the second limit is e and so the result is going to be e right similarly here we have a product limit of a product is product of the limits as long as these two limits exist independently right we can have situations where where this limit does exist but these limits don't and then you got to be a bit more careful so we can do that okay and limit of b n is e limit of c n is five so e times five or maybe we would prefer to write that as five e okay and last one we have a constant multiple so if you have a constant multiple you can bring it outside the limit so this is one thousand times the limit as n goes to infinity of a n so it's one thousand times 0 which is 0. right so it's not so bad so the next thing that we're going to look at is what it means for a sequence to be bounded okay so here's the definition okay so we'll have a sequence let's say a n and we'll say that it's bounded if it's underline bounded so it's bounded if there are constants let's say little m and big m such that a n each term in the sequence a n is always between little m and big m so little m is your lower bound big m is your upper bound and of course we need that to hold for all natural numbers right it's for all n equal to 1 2 3 and so on we require every single term in the sequence to be between these two bounds okay so that's a relatively straightforward definition visually you can sort of think about how this looks right um if you plot the terms in your sequence you have some upper bound big m some lower bound little m and every term in the sequence has to lie in between those two bounds okay so we come over here to this example we've got a couple of sequences we want to decide whether or not these are bounded uh it becomes pretty clear once you start writing out terms in the sequence right so here we have one one half one third one over four and so on um so in particular they keep getting smaller right and i think it's pretty clear here that we have one over n less than or equal to 1 for all and bigger than or equal to 1. in fact if you just take reciprocal of both sides right if you if you have an inequality involving positive numbers and you take reciprocals the inequality reverses and done okay on the other hand if we come over to here you look at the sequences right two maybe we start at two to the zero so one two four 8 16. so on um these are not going to be bounded right there they grow without bound it's an exponential function we know in fact we know that the limit as n goes to infinity of 2 to the n is infinite so there can't possibly be an upper bound right these numbers grow without bound all right so in this video we're going to discuss a theorem related to bounded sequences the theorem says that every convergent sequence is bounded so in other words if the limit as n goes to infinity of a n is equal to l and l is some finite value right l is less than infinity then the sequence a n is bounded right that's what it says um now be careful uh this does not say that every bounded sequence is convergent it says every convergence sequence is bounded so you got to be careful those are two different statements one is true one is false this one is true and let me show you why um we'll actually prove this so let's suppose that the limit as n goes to infinity of a n is equal to l okay um now let's think about the the definition of convergence right definition says for every epsilon i can choose a capital n so that for every little n bigger than that capital n the difference between a n and l will be less than epsilon so i can choose any epsilon because i know this limit exists so if i take epsilon equal to one there has to be some capital n such that the absolute value of a n minus l is less than one for all n bigger than or equal to big n now another way to rewrite this is to say well that means that this difference is between minus one and one and if i add l to everything that means that minus one plus l is less than a n is less than one plus l right or so a n is between l plus one and l minus one okay uh but only only for those values of n that are bigger than or equal to this capital n right what about the ones that came before well the ones that came before are a finite list right so basically what we do is we're going to let big m be the maximum of all the numbers a1 a2 a3 and so on down to a let's say n maybe you want to go n minus 1 if you want but it's fine let's leave it in and also we throw in l plus one and we can let little m be the minimum of a1 a2 a3 down to a n and then l minus one right and so essentially that's it you if if we take you know any term in the sequence any a n in the sequence um well then it has to be less than or equal to the biggest of these numbers if it's you know so if it's one of those terms it has to be less than or equal to one of these right whichever one of those is biggest and if we take an a n for little and bigger than this capital n well then we know that a n has to be smaller than l plus one right so whichever one of these numbers is biggest that's the upper bound similar whichever one of these numbers is smallest is is going to be the lower bound so we know that a n has to be in between for each value of n and that proves the theorem okay so every convergence sequence has a bound we've just demonstrated it but not every bounded sequence converges right um a good example of that is you just take take like the sequence minus one to the n it's bounded right it's always between minus one and one but it goes back and forth forever it never comes settles down to a limit so there are bounded sequences that don't converge we can add one more condition that does guarantee convergence and that's what we're going to talk about in the next video so the next thing that we want to talk about is monotone sequences so this is a definition has two parts so part one part 2. so a sequence a n is monotone increasing if a n is less than or equal to a n plus 1 for all natural numbers n and similarly it's decreasing if a n is bigger than or equal to a n plus 1 for all natural numbers n right so it's a very simple concept it aligns fairly well with you know what we understand for increasing decreasing functions although we do allow we don't insist on a strict inequality here we allow less than or equal when we're dealing with moderate with sequences so monotone increasing monotone decreasing right this condition here just says that the next term in the sequence has to be at least as big as the previous term right here the next term in the sequence is less than or equal so these ones are getting smaller these ones are getting bigger simple enough right so there's an important theorem related to monotone sequences bounded monotone sequences which says so and collectively we can say monotone if it's either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing and the theorem says the following the theorem says every bounded monotone sequence converges okay so that's what the theorem states so we mentioned before this previous theorem we proved that every convergence sequence has to be bounded and i warned that the converse is not true right every bounded sequence is not necessarily convergent but if we do have a bounded monotone sequence right the added condition of mono monotonicity guarantees that you can't have this sequence that's jumping back and forth right because it always has to be going up or always going down okay and so you're guaranteed convergence for every bounded monotone sequence um we're not going to prove this theorem because a proof requires actually getting into you know um careful sort of axiomatic definition of the real numbers you have to talk about least upper bounds least upper bound property of the real numbers but intuitively it's pretty clear why this has to work right so if we think about a bounded monotone increasing sequence right so if it's increasing and bounded above right if that's our upper bound and our sequence is increasing so maybe we start here we go up it's increasing it's increasing right but we can't pass n right so each term has to get bigger but we can't get any bigger than m all right we can't go back down because then we wouldn't be monotonous increasing we can't cross m because it's an upper bound right and so the idea here is is the way you would prove this is um one of the properties that the real numbers have is that any sequence that is bounded above has a least upper bound and so basically you would say well look here's uh here's a sequence of numbers it's bounded above we look for the least upper bound and you can prove that that loose upper bound has to be the limit right but then you've got to get into this discussion of least upper bound properties and of course for a sequence which is monotone decreasing and bounded below well it's going to do the same sort of thing right it's going to decrease down until we get closer and closer to that lower bound but we can't pass it so we approach whatever the greatest lower bound is and that's going to be the limit all right so here are four sequences we want to decide if these are monotone increasing monotone decreasing because we're interested in whether we can apply this theorem we've just discussed right we have a theorem says every bounded monotone sequence converges and so if we can identify when a sequence is bounded and monotone well then we have a very powerful tool for determining convergence of a sequence so let's look at these the first one is pretty straightforward and we might notice that n plus 1 over n can be written as 1 plus 1 over n and it's also pretty clear that the this is going to be decreasing right because as n gets bigger one over n gets smaller and so this is going to be going to be decreasing well maybe that's not a very water tight argument you know it's essentially appealing to the fact that these terms lie on the graph y is one over x we know that that's decreasing so we go with it right uh now there's a couple of ways that you could actually establish this right so one way you could establish this is we could say well you know if i let f of x equal 1 plus 1 over n or i guess it should be x now sorry all right so so our sequence is just the values of f of x when we when we restrict the domain to the to the natural numbers but we know that the derivative of this thing is minus one over x squared which is less than zero if x is bigger than 1 bigger than or equal to 1 and it's less than 0 for every x but in particular for x less than or equal to 1. and so that certainly establishes that this is a decreasing sequence the other the other way you can do it is you can consider the difference a n plus 1 minus a n okay if our sequence is decreasing then this term should be smaller than that term so this difference should be negative so we can try to show that that difference is negative you can go ahead and try it but we'll do it in the next one right it is done in the book if you want to look in the book you can go through how to how to do it that way we'll apply in the next one because we've got four examples to get through and we don't want this video to get too long okay so how about the next one we could once again kind of use this function argument here but we could just go ahead and do it right so this time there's not a nice simplification but we can say well what do we get if we do b n plus 1 minus bn okay what does that look like well we're going to have n plus 1 squared over n plus 2 subtract n squared over n plus one and we'd like to get a common denominator for that so we're going to get n plus one cubed minus n squared times n plus two over n plus one and plus two and well now we've got to multiply this all out n cubed plus three n squared plus three n plus one using binomial theorem minus n cubed minus two n squared over n plus n plus 2. and so we take a look at this and we say all right that cancels with that 2n squared that cancels with 2 of those 3 leaves you with 1. and okay so we have n squared plus 3n plus 1 n plus 1 n plus 2. that's positive okay because n is positive and so now we know that this particular sequence here is increasing right because the difference is positive good one decreasing one increasing we can go to the next one so the next one actually you know it's gonna bounce around on you initially you might find if you start plotting some of the values textbook does that for you right we can consider you know if n is equal to 0 what do we get right if we sort of start writing out the terms in the sequence when n is equal to 0 we have minus 9 over over 26 when n is equal to 1 we have minus 8 over what are we going to get 17 right n is equal to 2 we have minus 5 over 2 right n is equal to 0 we get 0 right and so on we can start plotting these and sort of play around and see where they go um and it's kind of hard to tell looking at those values to figure it out we can do this sort of difference method again the textbook does that for you it's it's a big mess though um you might want to sort of analyze the two polynomials in n that you see here see if you can get anything out of that you might want to for example well the top we can factor i don't know if that helps this at all but we can factor it the bottom let's see the bottom we could complete the square n minus five squared plus one well it's never zero that's good news you can play around with that you can you can do this difference but it's it's going to be it's going to be ugly um so maybe we do want to look at this one from the point of view of a function we say okay let's consider let's consider f of x to be x squared minus 9 for x squared minus 10 x plus 26. what's the derivative f prime is going to be 2x times x squared minus 10x plus 26. good little quotient rule okay subtract x squared minus 9 times 2x minus 10 whole thing over x squared minus 10x plus 26 all squared okay let me clean that up give myself a bit more room f prime of x so i've got 2 x cubed minus 20 x squared plus 52 x minus 2x cubed from here and then i've got uh minus 10x squared minus plus 10x squared um minus 18x plus becomes plus 18x um and then minus 90. well that's a mess but you know what it's it's actually okay it's not it's not as bad of a mess as you might think we look for cancellations again cancel there we can cancel there um this was 10 that adds up so we get and then that's going to be 70 right so we get on top now the bottom is never zero right we established that up here the numerator is always positive and we're squaring it yeah so i mean we just got to focus on the numerator um so that numerator we've got minus 10x squared plus 70x okay minus 90. okay so this is a quadratic and it's opening downwards right we can in fact we can pull out the minus 10. so we have x squared minus 7x plus 9. okay and it doesn't factor super nice but we can definitely tell that it's a quadratic it's opening downwards so these terms are initially increasing right they're initially increasing towards sort of that vertex in this quadratic on you know so there's a few values of of n at the beginning where we're on this side of the quadratic and things are increasing once we hit that maximum it's going to be decreasing right so we expect that this is an eventually decreasing sequence it's not decreasing from the beginning it's increasing a bit at the start but it's eventually going to start decreasing which is good enough okay we're getting a little long here there's one more still to go what can we say with this last one the factorial we can't really model with functions anymore we could try looking at the difference this might be one where it makes sense to just start writing out terms and initially initially it seems like it's increasing right so we have one for n equals one and then we're going to have four over two so we have two and then we have 9 over 6 oh that's already actually a little bit smaller right 16 16 over 24 right and then we have 25 over 120 and so on this is definitely decreasing right the factorial is going to grow much faster than the power function is so you have a decreasing sequence if you wanted to really kind of nail it down you could kind of look at this sort of difference again you could say okay what does the difference look like n plus 1 minus dn so you have n plus 1 squared over n plus 1 factorial minus n squared over n factorial actually if you remember that n plus 1 factorial is n plus 1 times n factorial right it's defined recursively then what you have here is just n plus 1 over n factorial minus n squared over n factorial okay and so it's minus n squared plus n plus 1 over over n factorial that is definitely going to be negative for large values of n right so once we pass here it's definitely negative we have a decreasing sequence all right so we're pretty much done with sequences now i'm ready to move on to series before we do i want to show you one more let's say slightly more challenging example this one has a sequence which is defined recursively right so we don't have a formula like most of the ones we've been dealing with so far we just have some formula that says a n is this function of n right and a lot of the time we can fall back on calculus techniques that we already have to understand what's going on but this one is defined recursively so we don't we don't have a function that we can work with so how do we find the limit of such a thing right i mean you can start thinking about like what do the what do the terms look like you know a1 is is root two a2 is root two plus root two a3 is root 2 plus root 2 plus root 2 and so on is that even going anywhere if so where right it's not at all clear how do we figure this out well we know that bounded monotone sequences converge okay so one of the things that we can do is we start plugging values in you know put them in the calculator you see what you get you get some numbers out right by the time you get to like a4 it's starting getting complicated enough that maybe you don't want to put it into the calculator anymore but you can try a few and if you try a few you find that you're getting numbers that are one point something you know they seem to be hovering a little bit below two so you might guess that two is an upper bound so that would be the first claim so we're going to claim that a n is less than or equal to 2 for all values of n well how do you show that how do you show that a n is going to be less than or equal to 2 for all values of n it's a little tricky right how do you deal with this recursively defined thing you could look at the difference you know 2 minus a n can we do anything with that let's see i mean 2 minus a n is what can i even say about a n um i don't know i can say it's like well i'm sorry 2 should go on the inside right you know put the square root of a n minus 1. um does that get me anywhere i want to show that this is positive right i want to show this is less than 2. so i want to show that that 2 minus a n is bigger than 0. not at all clear i could try rationalizing does rationalize get me anywhere um we are going to go somewhere don't worry all right we get 2 minus there and then we get you know 2 plus that square root on the bottom and okay you can simplify those cancel that's a plus um but you still feel like maybe you're stalled so how do you proceed well the right way to do this is you proceed using a technique called induction so we're going to proceed by induction okay so induction on and so the way this looks is we say okay so first of all we know that a1 is less than 2 right because a1 is square root of 2 we know that the square root of 2 is less than 2. okay 2. we're going to suppose suppose we know that some a k is less than or equal to 2. right actually we do we know when k is equal to one right and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna imagine well maybe maybe we also know this for some other values of k two three four we don't yet but suppose we did so the next step is we say well if we know that can we show that a k plus 1. is less than or equal to 2. this is this is how an induction argument works now we're going to do it before we do it let's point out why it works why does this work well essentially what you're showing here is you're showing this implication right you're showing that if this is less than or equal to 2 then the next one will be less than or equal to 2 so we have this implication going like that we know a1 is less than or equal to 2. so this is true when k is equal to 1. but if the hypothesis of a conditional is true so is the conclusion so we know that a one is less than or equal to two therefore a two is less than or equal to two but now we come back right a two is less than or equal to two therefore a3 is less than or equal to 2. since a3 is less than equal to 2 a4 is less than or equal to 2 and so on so we just kind of get into this this loop and we generate all the other possibilities so it remains to show that if a k is less than or equal to 2 then ak plus 1 should be less than or equal to 2. well why is that true if we assume a k is less than or equal to 2 well then we get that ak plus 1 is well by definition it's 2 plus square root of 2 plus ak right oh but we've assumed that ak is less than or equal to 2 so this must be less than or equal to the square root of 2 plus 2 right replace a k by something bigger but 2 plus 2 is 4 square root of 4 is 2. okay and that means that a n is less than equal to 2 for all natural numbers n using this technique of induction very good okay so now we want to show that so we've shown it's bounded now we want to show that it's monotone okay so i'm going to claim that a n is less than or equal to a n plus 1 for all and i want to show that it's increasing okay and so we could we could try something like this we could try playing around with differences and you know i think you can sort of get something to work doing it that way you can look at the difference you can put in the definition i mean let's let's check quickly and see what happens if i do the difference a n plus 1 minus a n well that's root 2 plus a n minus a n rationalize i get uh it's going to be 2 plus a n um oh well you know this isn't so great either right because if i rationalize i get 2 plus a n and i get minus a n squared over okay that doesn't seem ideal ok so we we scratch that so that doesn't seem to be working um let's try induction again can we do it by induction um if n is equal to one so we have chi we have a starting point right what's the base case so if n is equal to one is it true that a1 is less than or equal to a2 well let's see we know what a1 is a2 is the square root of two plus a one okay and let's see well we know that a1 is certainly bigger than zero right so this is bigger than simply root two and root two is a one okay got that um so now if we suppose assume that a k is less than or equal to a k plus 1 for some k well then what would be the next step so the next step if we just if we would assume this here right we increment by one right going from two to three we increment by one so we want to show the next time we be sure that a k plus 2 is bigger than or equal to a k plus 1. so we say okay a k plus 2 by definition it's 2 plus a k plus 1. oh but we've assumed that ak plus 1 is bigger than or equal to a k ah but root of two plus a k that's a k plus one done okay so using this technique of induction we can show that it's bounded above by two we can show that it's increasing okay so it's increasing it's bounded above it has to have a limit we have a theorem that says the limit is guaranteed okay so how do we find that limit now that we know it exists well here's a here's a sneaky trick we have this equality right let's take the limit of both sides limit as n goes to infinity for a n plus 1 should be equal to the limit well i get a little bit ahead of myself but let me let's do it i've already wrote the square root you can bring the limit inside the square root because square root function is continuous okay and the kicker here is that this limit okay that's l right l is the limit is equal to infinity of a n but i mean that's going to be the same limit here right because here you're just incrementing by 1 you get to the same place if n is going to infinity so is n plus 1. so l is equal to the square root of 2 plus l got to solve for l square both sides l squared is 2 plus l so l squared minus l minus 2 is 0. so let's see l minus two l plus one two possibilities for the limit well it's certainly not minus one because all of the terms are positive so looks like the limit should be 2. all right so we're going to move on now from sequences to series now in a sense a sequel a series is just a special type of sequence um it's a new sequence that's built from an old sequence um maybe more or more correctly a series is the limit of this new sequence um let me explain so start with some sequence okay so we have a sequence let's say a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 and so on i'm going to write out the terms okay so as an example we could do the sequence one one half one quarter right so in general this is just a geometric sequence right with ratio one half one over powers of two and now what we're going to do is we're going to form the socalled partial sums okay so s1 is just a1 s2 the sum of the first two terms in the sequence okay s3 will be a1 plus a2 plus a3 s4 will be a1 plus a2 plus a3 plus a4 and so on right so in general we could say sn would be the sum k going from 1 to n of ak okay sum of the first n terms so this gives me a new sequence right this is is a sequence okay and if you have a sequence then it's reasonable to ask does it converge and well what what would be the limit of that sequence right what should it mean to say okay well what would it converge to what would be that limit if that limit exists what does it look like it's the limit n going to infinity of this s n well maybe we write that as the limit and going to infinity of this sum k going from 1 to n of a k and it's sort of notationally convenient to say well really what we mean then is something like this it's the sum k going from 1 to infinity of a sub k right we just keep adding the terms forever okay so this notation that you see here this is what we would call a series okay so a series is the sum of a sequence okay now for a lot of sequences that even sequences that converge a series is not necessarily going to converge right in particular we can see right away that um if the terms in the sequence are not shrinking and it's not shrinking fast enough right for example if if all the values in this sequence are staying close to some value like say two right then this is like two two plus two two plus two plus two two plus two plus two plus two right if you're if you keep adding more and more terms and those terms are always close to 2 well then this sum is going to explode on you right the sum gets bigger and bigger and bigger it doesn't have a limit so it may not converge right so when we're studying sequences we can use a lot of sort of calculus techniques we can play around we can often you know use analytic arguments to say oh yes this sequence converges and it converges to a particular limit here we just calculated it series is a very sort of different approach the flavor is much different the feeling is different because when you're dealing with series it's rare that you can actually say what a series converges to this happens to be one where we can so maybe it's a bad example but a lot of the time you're trying to show that a series converges you want to show that this sum right the limit of this sum is finite that you actually get a value out you may never be able to calculate it it might be that all you can do is say that the limit exists it has a value we don't know what it is but it exists right that can be frustrating for some people it's a change in process from a lot of what you've done the only thing you've seen so far that's similar to it is probably when you're doing like comparison tests for improper integrals so it's a bit of an adjustment but hopefully it's one that you're able to make coming back to this one here let's see what those partial sums look like why not s1 is one as two is one plus a half which is three halves that's three one plus a half plus a quarter um so let's see that is four quarters plus two quarters plus one quarter seven quarters right that's four one plus a half plus a quarter plus an eighth one plus two plus four plus eight i get 15 over eight okay s5 one plus a half plus a quarter plus an eighth plus one over 16. and if you add that all up you find that you get 31 over over 16. right you get 2 minus 1 2 minus a half 2 minus a quarter two minus an eighth two minus the sixteenth and and so on and so you might guess that this pattern continues of course you should actually show it and there are ways to show it and we'll do that later on but each of these partial sums these are called partial sums right is 2 minus a number and the number that we're subtracting gets smaller and smaller as we go through the partial sums which makes you think that hey maybe just maybe this adds up to something right and actually you can sort of see it visually right if you think about taking the number line from zero to two there's one in the middle and you start filling it up right um well the first and so you always fill half of what there is to fill right so in the first step we add one right in the second step we add a half in the third step we add a quarter that's half of what's left over in the fourth step we had an eighth then we had a sixteenth right so you get this sort of like xenos paradox style thing going on at each step you you know you cover half the distance that's the remaining right so you go half the distance remaining so there's always a little bit remaining because you only cover half the remaining distance right but each time you recover half the meaning every time you cover half the remaining distance you get a little bit closer and closer and closer to two until the distance that's left is so small um that you know it's less than let's say epsilon for example if you're thinking about doing epsilon and definition for a limit um and so indeed you can show that the limit actually converges converges to 2 and the sum k going from 1 to infinity actually we started at 0 right 1 is 1 over 2 to the 0 one over two to the k comes out to be two pretty cool all right so in the last video we we introduced the idea of a series as this limit of a sequence of partial sums for some preexisting sequence right so if that limit exists we say that the sequence convert or the series converges if it doesn't exist we say the series diverges so here are two series that we want to show diverge so how do we do it well um we can start thinking about what what are the partial sums look like right so in this case here we have s1 you can even start at 0 right s0 is 0 squared 0 s1 is 0 squared plus 1 squared which is 1 as 2 is 0 squared plus 1 squared plus 2 squared is 5 that's 3 0 squared 1 squared oops 2 squared 3 squared is 14 and so on and it certainly seems like those partial sums are going to keep growing and growing and growing well in general we know that s k is the sum you know let's say uh n going from 1 to k might as well start at 1 right starting at 0 we're adding 0 we don't gain anything from that n going from 1 to k of of n squared oh we've seen that before way back when we were doing like riemann sums right we saw this summation formula maybe we did it with i instead we get something like k k plus 1 2 k plus 1 over 6. and so certainly we can see from this that if we take the limit as k goes to infinity of of sk well that limit is going to be infinite right um this thing grows more or less as k cubed okay so certainly the limit uh doesn't exist so the series diverges all right how about this one here well let's start writing out you know what what is what does the sequence look like right so bn looks like well if n is equal to one this is minus one squared so one and it's gonna be minus one one minus one one minus one one right forever okay so from there well what does sn look like well we just do one and then one minus one we get to zero one minus one plus one one one minus one plus one minus one zero and i think by now you can probably guess the pattern we get something that looks like that okay so no fancy formula this time we just look at this and say well look we have a sequence which just alternates between zero and one we want the limit of that sequence well that limit certainly does not exist right the limit as n goes to infinity of s n does not exist so the series diverges so the next example we want to look at or a topic if you like is geometric series so the geometric series is a special type of series where we actually can understand pretty much everything there is to know about the geometric series it's also an important series because it comes up quite a bit when once we move on right later on we're going to look at power series taylor series right we're going to have so power series is sort of a natural extension you know from polynomials to things where you know we're still working in powers of x but we don't have a highest power of x right we just keep going on forever adding more and more terms in which case well you know you're going to have like an x to the n in there and you want to understand what's going on right you want you're going to be seeing series that look like that okay some people will put a constant in there like an a a times r to the n and call that a geometric series but you can always factor out the constant bring it out front even for an infinite series that works so we'll just concentrate on this and if we want to put a constant in we can always multiply by a constant all right so what can we say about a geometric series well one notice that notice that we start at zero not at one okay so if we were writing out the terms in the sequence that we're using here right the terms in the sequence are one r r squared r cubed and so on we add we add by r every time so we can think of those as maybe like the a n's and then the sn right the partial sums that we're adding up those are going to be 1 1 plus r 1 plus r plus r squared 1 plus r plus r squared plus r cubed and so on okay now uh what's cool is we can actually come up with a nice closed form formula for those partial sums okay so we have the following so if we look at sn so sn would be 1 plus r plus r squared okay up to r to the n right now i'm going to do this i'm going to do r times s n multiply everything by r so then i have r plus r squared and r cubed and so on up to r to the n and then n plus 1. now i've shifted it over one because what i want to do is i want to subtract these subtract so on this side if i subtract i'm going to have 1 minus r times sn right 1sn minus rsn gives me 1 over r if i factor out the sn and on the other side i have 1 r minus r r squared minus r squared rn right all of these terms cancel we're just left with that last one r to the n plus 1. okay so that means that my partial sums look like this 1 minus r to the n plus 1 divided by 1 minus r okay and notice that the dependence on n is entirely here in this exponent okay so now we ask ourself well what happens what happens if you take the limit as n goes to infinity of r r to the n or n plus one if you like okay well there are three possibilities um and i guess you know just to keep things uh let's keep things simple for now um no we'll just say let r be a real number um if the absolute value of r is less than one okay then this limit will be zero okay because if you take a number that's less than one an absolute value when you raise it to a higher power gets larger and larger and larger and you get zero in the limit okay it's equal to one if r is equal to 1. it's undefined if r is equal to 1 because it's just going to flop back and forth between 1 minus 1. and it's going to be infinite if the absolute value of r is bigger than 1. okay all right so these these are not too hard to work out you can convince yourself that these are true and so then we look at this and we say okay well what can we say then about this sequence of partial sums well um minus one we actually saw that in the last video right we saw an example minus one to the n that series diverges right we don't get anything there so that one diverges uh one to the n also diverges right because the one i guess case that we left out here is this is all well and good if r is not equal to one right but if r is equal to 1 then sn is just n right because you're just going to be doing 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 right so you get n and limit of n is n goes to infinity is certainly infinite okay and so we look at this and we say well you know what the the only time where you can actually take a limit of this is going to be if absolute value of r is less than one so what we can say is that this geometric series n going from zero to infinity r to the n it converges if the absolute value of r is less than one and in that case we get an answer 1 over 1 minus r for that sum right because this part is going to go to zero okay and it diverges otherwise so this is an interesting example because not only can we say exactly when it converges we can say what it converges to that's not always going to be the case all right here are three quick examples three quarters to the n minus one to the n over two to the n three to the n we wanna identify these as geometric series decide if they converge if they do converge figure out what the value is okay so in this case here it fits fits the pattern right we say okay what is the value of r r is three quarters and three quarters is definitely less than one an absolute value so we know that it converges and we know what it converges to all right the sum and going from zero to infinity maybe i'll point that out it converges and so let's figure that out so 3 over 4 to the n okay it's going to converge to 1 over 1 minus r r is 3 quarters so one over a quarter if we simplify we get four okay moving on to the next one well one of the things that you need to realize here is that i can always rewrite that as minus 1 half to the n right same as this one here we could have equally well being given this one as 3 to the n divided by 4 to the n so you got to be able to you know do those basic laws of exponents manipulations to get things into the right form all right it's in the right form so what's r r is minus onehalf and we know that the absolute value of minus onehalf is onehalf which is less than one so again we have a convergent series and what is the sum n going from zero to infinity of minus one half to the n it's going to be one over one minus minus one half okay so one plus half so one over three halves take the reciprocal we get two thirds okay this last one here well r is equal to three that's bigger than one so that diverges so the next type of series we want to look at is a p series okay so the basic form of a p series looks like this it's just one over some power of n right p is the power here p and p series is the power of n that we see in the denominator we can consider a basic p series where we simply have a power of n we might see something more general like this where we have some coefficients in there the only thing you've got to be careful about here is the starting point i've written n equals 1 but we'd have to check to make sure you know so a a and b here i mean they they could be any real numbers but we'd have to check to see when when does a n plus b when is that equal to zero right we want to watch out for that make sure it's not equal to zero if there is a zero for this at a positive value for n right if there's a if there's an integer value of n that gives me a zero i better start my series after that or it's not going to be defined right so we won't even get to talk about convergence because there's going to be one term in the series that blows up all right so the main result about p series is the following theorem which states that a p p series converges if p is strictly greater than one and it diverges otherwise so it diverges for p less than or equal to one okay so that's simple enough now this pseries test tells us whether or not the series converges it doesn't say anything about what that series converges to right so this is strictly a test for convergence we are not trying to calculate a value for the series should remind you a little bit about the pseries test for improper integrals and in fact that's where we get this from we'll see in the next section that we can use the result that we have for improper integrals to establish this result for p series so the proof of this result is going to have to wait but in the meantime we can put it to use here are several series we can see do they converge or diverge this one here this is actually an important result this is the socalled harmonic series okay and in this case p is equal to one but it's not bigger than one so this diverges okay so the harmonic series is a is sort of a famous counter example right um the first thing that you might kind of think when you start working with series you know you're adding infinitely many terms so you might think that as long as the terms go to zero you should be able to add them all up but the harmonic series is is this classic example that shows it's not enough to have the terms in your series go to zero that's not enough for you to have a sum you actually need those terms to go to zero fast enough or the thing is not going to converge right and so we can think of this as a consequence of the p series test that this series diverges although there are other ways that you can do this you can prove divergence sort of directly the the classic way that you do this is you say okay well my my sequence looks like one plus a half plus a third plus a quarter plus a fifth and so on and you start sort of grouping things together and you say okay well you know these two terms they add up to something that's that's bigger than a half and then actually if i added the next sort of three terms a fifth plus a sixth plus a plus a seventh those are going to add up to something that's bigger than a half and so on i think this is the this is the strategy that we use and and so by sort of grouping things appropriately we can say well the whole thing is is bigger than one you know plus a half plus a half plus a half and that's going to go to infinity if you keep adding one half forever interesting this next one well this is p series with p equal to two so this converges right here p is equal to two so this one converges this one is another famous series because we actually can say what the sum is and the sum is sort of surprising hope i remember this correctly the result is something like pi squared over 6 and you might be surprised to see pi making an appearance there and there are a number of ways that you can derive this result different areas of mathematics it pops up you can show it using surprisingly enough complex numbers complex analysis there's one way to show it there's other ways coming from differential equations there's also it's a strange result it pops up in a number of places there there are three or four very different proofs of the result the original result i think goes all the way back to euler and so that's interesting maybe more interesting as far as i know if we go to 1 over n cubed nobody actually knows what that adds up to we know it converges right it's p series with p equal to three p is bigger than one it converges nobody knows what it converges to odd how about this one uh okay this is well root n is one half so it is a p series but p is equal to one half and one half is smaller than one right two is bigger than one we should have pointed that out um and so that means that this one diverges okay this one here is not a p series we actually can't comment on the convergence of this one yet when you have this minus 1 to the n this alternating sign right so the the terms in this series are going to alternate between positive negative positive negative positive negative as you add them up those series have a special name they're called alternating series and there are special techniques for dealing with them it turns out that this alternating series does actually converge so adding that alternating sign is enough to take this divergent harmonic series and give you a convergent alternating series it does converge um and actually interestingly enough we know what this converges to as well converges to the natural log of two that's weird right actually we're going to see once we get to talking about taylor series we'll see where that comes from okay so it's not a p series but we'll see later on how to show that one converges this one here well this is a p series right it's a sort of this general form of the p series with p equal to three which is bigger than one and so that means that this one converges um notice the starting value 11 right we can't we can't do 10 because we get a zero in the denominator so we got to make sure that we watch out for things like zeros in the denominators start the sum a little bit later on once you're past all the zeros and then you can talk about convergence last one well the last one is not a p series the last one is geometric series fortunately we've already done that right this is geometric it's not a p series but it's geometric with r equal to one half and of course one half is less than one in absolute value so we know that this converges and actually we we know what it converges to we saw this in the introduction video converges to two so the next few examples we're going to look at deal with what are called telescoping series so a telescoping series is one where as we write out the partial sums we find that there's a lot of cancellation so there's a lot of cancellation within the sums and that allows us to evaluate the the series right now this one here we can actually we could show that this converges using essentially p series um or comparison we haven't established comparison tests yet but if you really wanted to you could do something like this right you could write this as the sum n equals sorry 1 get it over common denominator and minus n plus 1 then we subtract n we just have 1 over n times n plus 1 right and so that's roughly 1 over n squared p series p equals 2 bigger than 1 converges so we're pretty sure it converges but we don't necessarily know what it converges to so here's here's where we can kind of play around with this and we say okay well let's start looking at the partial sums s1 one minus a half okay s2 we get 1 minus a half right there's the n equals 1 term now we add the n equals 2 term one half minus the third s3 we have one minus a half plus a half minus the third and now we go for the n equals three term third minus a quarter and maybe now you can sort of see what's going on right we can we could regroup this as one minus a half plus a half so half minus half in there all right minus a third so one minus a third right here we can regroup this as one half minus a half all right and then third minus a third all right and then minus a quarter so we get one minus a quarter right and you can probably guess what's going to happen for the next one right so in general if we went down to sn we would have one minus a half and then plus a half minus a third and then plus the third minus a quarter and so on down to you know well so the very last term will be one over n minus one over n plus one and of course just before that there would have been a minus 1 over n n minus 1 so on and so basically everything cancels right there's a quarter there that will cancel with that those will cancel those will cancel and you just get one minus one over n plus one all right well now we know what the uh we know what we get because we we know that a series is just equal to the limit of the sequence of partial sums right so it's the limit and going to infinity of 1 over 1 minus 1 over n plus 1. that's going to go to 0 so we get a limit of 1. okay here are two more examples start with this one now this certainly doesn't look like a telescoping series but remember the previous one i pointed out you know they've given to us as one over n subtract one over n plus one i think it was that if you put it over a common denominator then you get something that looks like this right we said hey you can sort of do like a p series sort of thing on it if you wanted to um but of course you may also need to reverse that process so we might have to say okay let's work over on the side and say okay we've got 2 over n times n plus 2 right rational function we can do partial fractions a over n b over n plus 2. right so how do we solve for these remember if we multiply everything by n we have a isolated put in n is equal to zero this disappears it's gone from there putting n equal to zero because two over two so a is one if i multiply everything by n plus two this will disappear when we plug in 2 that'll just be b this is gone put in minus 2 2 over minus 2 b is minus 1. okay so we can rewrite this as the sum and going from one to infinity of sorry something fell off the light still working let's keep going 1 over n plus 2. all right start writing out the partial sum see if we can figure out what's going on okay so we have you know let's just write it kind of a general one what it's going to look like s n okay so n equals one i have one minus a third then let's go to two one half minus a quarter oh it doesn't look promising does it oh but let's go to three a third minus a fifth let's go to four a quarter minus a sixth and so on so we actually do get some cancellation we eventually get some cancellation right uh the onethird cancels with the onethird onequarter will cancel with one quarter right that onefifth is going to cancel with the 1 over 5 and the next one the 1 over 6 is going to cancel with something in the next one but the one half the one half survives so we get one plus a half you know and pretty much everything else is going to cancel down to well we're going to have a couple terms left over right and that was going to be that's from n equals four yeah so we have one over n plus one so simplifies down to there okay and if n goes to infinity well these are going to go to zero and those stick around right so if we take the limit as n goes to infinity we're just left with one plus a half so we get three over two for the limit okay come to this last one well that definitely doesn't look like a harmonic or sorry a telescoping series but maybe we can do something weight can we do something with it ah yes log properties right we know that log of n plus one over n okay is the same thing as log n plus one minus log n okay so that means if we start writing out the partial sums right s n right is going to be well first of all log 2 minus log 1 which is just 0 right plus log 3 minus log 2 right then it's going to be log of 4 minus log of 3 and then log of 5 minus log of 4 and so on down to log of n plus 1 minus log of n okay so now we look for cancellations right log 3 cancels with log 3 log 2 cancels with log 2 log 4 is going to cancel with log 4 right the next term would be log 6 minus log 5. log 5's cancel actually everything cancels except for except for that so the nth partial sum is the natural log of n plus 1. okay but if we let n go to infinity on that we don't get a value right it's infinite so this diverges it diverges if you like you might add it diverges to infinity but the main point is it diverges all right we have three series here on the board that we want to try to evaluate um the strategy for all of these is going to be to work with some basic properties for series and a few known results some of which i've mentioned previously some of which are summarized in the textbook we'll we'll point them out as we go so a couple of the properties that we are going to rely on here are going to be things like if you have the series of a sum you can write that as a sum of a series so some of the ans some of the bn's and if you have a common constant multiple say c times a n inside the series you can factor it out okay and the reason you can do that is that well for each of the partial sums right for a partial sum it's just a constant multiple you can factor it out and then the series of course is the limit of that sequence of partial sums and we know that for limits if you have a constant multiple inside the limit you can bring it out similar arguments will work here right um we know that for finite sums this is valid we also know that the limit of a sum is some of the limits and so we can we can make that argument to get those things to work okay so let's come to something like this n going from 1 to infinity we've got minus 1 to the n n squared minus n over n cubed how are we going to deal with it well let's try manipulating a little bit first so n going from 1 to infinity let's leave that minus 1 to the n plus 1 out front and notice that we can divide each of these individually by n right so n squared over n cubed is just 1 over n n over n cubed is 1 over n squared okay so we can split it up like that so then we can write this if we multiply that through and we split this up into two series we can write it like this minus 1 to the n plus 1 over n subtract sum and going from 1 to infinity minus 1 to the n plus 1 over n squared okay now each of these turn out to be known results and these are not things that you're supposed to know how to come up with or establish at this point they're just results that somebody somewhere in the past has proved they're given to us in the textbook as a list of known values and so we're just going to use them this first one here is the natural log of 2. i think i've got that right the minus sign might be off by minus 1 but no i think that's right and this one here it turns out that this one is pi squared over 12. why i don't know there's some fairly sophisticated mathematics that probably goes into establishing that well beyond what we're doing in this course but there you have it right you can get that answer how about something like this well we can use the constant multiple rule and we can write it as 1000 times the sum and going from 1 to infinity of 1 over n factorial now one of the known results that's given to us in the book says that if this sum started at 0 the sum going from 0 to infinity of 1 over n factorial is actually equal to e to euler's number so the sum is starting at the wrong point but that's okay we can we can modify that we can say all right if i started the sum at zero um well what does the n equals zero term look like the n equals zero term is just one over one factor or 1 over 0 factorial which is just 1 right so by starting the sum 1 earlier i've added 1. so i can subtract 1 to balance okay and then i know that this is e and that's well minus 1. okay so we can get that answer again we will actually see later on why this is equal to e once we've done power series taylor series we'll see why that's equal to e but we're not there yet all right this last one well what do we have we have 1 over 4 squared plus 1 over 5 squared plus 1 over 6 squared 1 over 7 squared so we've got the sum n going from 4 to infinity of 1 over n squared okay well that is the same thing as the sum and going from 1 to infinity of 1 over n squared if we subtract off the n equals 1 term the n equals 2 term and the n equals 3 terms sorry 3 squared is 9. right oops there i'll get it right eventually okay um and this one over n squared that's that result we've mentioned already this is pi squared over six and this here i mean i guess if we want to get the common denominator 36 do we really want to do it uh why not 36 minus 9 well let's add them 36 plus sign 45 plus 4 39 sorry 49 49 over 36 for our answer all right so in the previous videos we introduced the notion of a series an infinite series as the sum of the terms in a sequence we talked about convergence and divergence we gave a couple of examples of series where we can actually compute the sum so we talked about geometric series we started with telescoping series and we saw how to decide whether or not those converge or diverge we also introduced the ptest for convergence of a series although at the time we didn't really have a justification for it now we start getting into some of the tests for convergence that will let us decide whether or not a series converges or diverges right now these tests are not going to help us find the value for a series if it does converge they're simply going to answer this question yes or no does it converge the first one is the integral test so here's the statement of the integral test so we start with a function it does have two requirements and if you are going to apply the integral test it's important that you confirm that these requirements are verified the function has to be positive it has to be decreasing the one place where there's maybe a little bit of flexibility here is you could always replace this number one by some other value maybe replace that by some integer k maybe you want to start at zero maybe maybe you have a function that isn't decreasing everywhere but you know for x bigger than or equal to 10 it is decreasing well then maybe you want to start at k is equal to 10 right and then of course if you make that change you would make the corresponding change down here and here okay so we do this standard thing where we talked about it those sequences we can always define a sequence if we have any function that's defined for at least all positive real numbers we can restrict the domain to the natural numbers and that gives us a sequence so the integral test says the convergence of the series where we sum the terms in this sequence convergence to that series is equivalent to convergence of the corresponding integral right so the if and only if is saying well if this converges so does this if this converges so does this or if you want to put it another way if this diverges so does this right so we look at this integral if it converges we know that this one converges if it diverges we know this one diverges and the idea here is we already have some practice with improper integrals and figuring out whether or not improper integrals converge or diverge and so anything that we learned about improper integrals and convergence of improper integrals can now be applied to convergence of series as long as we can put our series in this form for the appropriate type of function now if you want to see why this works it's actually pretty simple all right let's draw some coordinate axes let's draw a function which is positive and decreasing something like that okay and of course it needs to decrease to zero i mean it's not in the statement of the theorem but we know that if it doesn't decrease to zero we know that this is not going to converge and we know that that's not going to converge so better decrease the zero right and now we can mark off all the integer points one two three 4 6 7 8 9 and so on all right and we can think about area under the curve and we can think in terms of riemann sums all right so we're going to do you know so we can think about doing now i mean we really shouldn't talk about riemann sums we're talking about improper integrals because riemann sums need a closed interval to work with but um we can just go with sort of a fixed you know delta x equals one so we look at intervals of length one all right and if we do say left endpoints remember that when we do a riemann sum we can choose where on each interval we want to pick our point so if we do delta x equals one left endpoints well then we get something that looks like this all right okay and so on and so one of the things that you can see right away is that well what are these values right this is the point 1 f of 1 right this is the point 2 f of 2 and so on um the sum that we get right we get the sum and going from one and i guess we can continue all the way to infinity of f of n but f of n is just a n right times delta x but delta x is just one so we get the series actually right and what this is saying is that that series well that must be bigger then the corresponding integral right okay because we can see that we have a little bit extra in each rectangle so if we knew that this integral diverges if we know this integral diverges well and certainly the series has to diverge as well right because this is infinite so is that because it's bigger right um but you know you could equivalently decide that you're going to do maybe delta x equals 1 but you want to do right endpoints right so then we would get the underestimate right we use right endpoints we get that okay and so if we use right endpoints well then again this would be kind of f of 2 we're using f of 3 for the second rectangle f of 4 for the third and so on so we actually get we still get the sum of a n but actually n starts at two okay and starts at two and that amount is going to be less than the integral okay all right now that's not quite our series but if the sum starting at 2 converges well then certainly the entire sum converges because we can always just add right we can just do this we can say okay that's fine just add a 1 to both sides now you have the series right this is n equals 1 to infinity of a n and of course if this integral converges adding a number to it is not going to change the convergence of the integral um so if this converges this value is finite this is less so we expect that it should converge as well right um and yes i mean i'll i guess all this really you know if we don't put any conditions on the function this just tells us that well this number is not going to become infinite maybe that doesn't mean that the series is going to converge because you know what if what if the values bounce around a bit right well that's where you know the function we're saying the function has to be function has to be positive right so we're always so that means that all the a n's are positive so we can't have some series that oscillates back and forth because if we're jumping back and forth we'd have to be adding negative values we're not allowing that right and we need the decreasing condition as well again just to make sure that everything fits together the way it should but that's the integral test right so the way you apply the integral test is somebody hands you a series says does this converge well you look at the terms in this series and you say okay can i identify those terms with the values of some function if i can does the function have these properties or does it at least eventually have those properties if it does then you look at the corresponding improper integral um hopefully it's one that you know how to evaluate or at least decide on the convergence of and if you can decide whether or not the improper integral converges or diverges well then you can apply the theorem and you know whether or not your series converges or diverges all right so here's our first example where we're going to apply the integral test to determine the convergence or i guess well determine the convergence of m yeah so we mean decide if it converges or diverges right so we under determine the conversions of this series does it converge does it diverge all right so we make some identifications we say all right the terms are natural log of n over n squared that's what a n looks like and we can write that as f of n where our function f of x is the natural log of x divided by x squared so we got to check our conditions right um is it positive it's positive as long as the natural log is positive and that's true as long as x is bigger than 1 right log of 1 is zero so the first term in this in this series is actually zero so really we should say that uh n starts at two right we can at we can put n equals one in there with the n equals one term is zero we're adding zero it doesn't change anything is it decreasing how do we check if it's decreasing well we could appeal to the definition and say okay i want to show that if x2 is bigger than x1 then f of x2 should be smaller than f of x1 right um there are like sort of these like difference tests or ratio tests that you can apply to the sequence to see but it's a function of x it's a differentiable function of x we know how to decide if a differentiable function of x is decreasing we look at the derivative right let's look at the derivative f prime of x is going to be well let's do quotient rule derivative of the top 1 over x times x squared minus derivative of the bottom times the top divided by the bottom squared x to the 4. so this is going to be x times 1 minus 2 log x over x to the 4. okay um we need this to be negative when is this going to be negative it's going to be less than zero well it's going to be less than zero let's see well x can't be less than zero right it's a natural log x negative numbers aren't in the domain so it's going to be less than zero if one minus half log x is less than zero sorry one minus two log x is less than zero um and that's if let's see that's if the natural log of x is bigger than a half and that's going to be true if x is bigger than or equal to 2. natural log of 2 is like 0.6 something i think um okay so we're good to start at 2 right remember we we don't necessarily have to start at 1 in the statement of the theorem we can start at some k if we want to all right so we know that the theorem applies so now we look at the integral okay let's do that in green just so it stands apart from that we need to look at the integral from 2 to infinity we could do 1 if you want natural log of x over x squared times dx okay got to integrate by parts for this one let's kind of do that over and let's do the the indefinite integral over on the side just to remind ourselves how that goes so if we have a natural log that's always our u right so u is log x du is one over x dv one over x squared dx so v is minus one over x okay so we get minus log x over x plus the integral of v d u right so plus the integral plus because of the minus sign there plus integral of minus of one over x squared okay so we get minus log x over x minus one over x and i mean plus your c if you want to put the c in there okay so that means that this integral will be it'll be the limit as so let's say n goes to infinity of minus log n over n minus 1 over n okay that's the upper limit plug in the lower limit two log two over two okay plus one half and we just check now that this limit here is zero certainly that goes to zero uh one application of l'hopital's rule tells you that that one goes to zero right because derivative of the top gives you the one over n over the bottom gives you one and so we know that that limit is just zero so we get this finite value for the integral right integral converges and so we can state our conclusion we can say since the integral log x over x x squared it was sorry since that converges so does the sum and going from 1 or 2 if you want 2 to infinity of log n over n squared okay by the integral test all right so next we're going to prove a result that was promised in the previous section and we're going to prove the ptest we'll do it in general of course you can set a equal to 1 be equal to 0 and get the regular ptest but we'll we'll do the general version because of course that if we prove it in general it's going to apply the to the special case as well one thing that we should probably require though i think just well certainly i think we should specify that a is positive if a is equal to zero then this is just these are just constants and then we're adding up a constant and it's going to diverge right so we need a to be positive um if a was negative well you could factor the minus sign out you get a minus one to the p it's either plus or minus right it's constant multiple we don't worry about that and also just to simplify things for us let's assume that b is bigger than or equal to zero okay we'll assume that as well because if b is if b is negative then then we introduce the possibility that there might be a zero in the denominator for some value of n um and even even if that zero in the denominator doesn't occur at an integer even if it occurs at some rational value or i mean these could be real numbers or it could be some real number value it would still be the case that there's a vertical asymptote somewhere right um and if that vertical asymptote occurs somewhere between like let's say it occurs between n equals five and n equals six or something like that um well we won't have a positive decreasing function until we cross the vertical asymptote so we can handle that we just modify things right a finite number of terms doesn't affect convergence we can always start at some other value but just to keep life simple assume that b is bigger than equal to zero um so we don't have to worry about an asymptote okay at least we don't have to worry about an asymptote that happens for positive values of n right okay very good so with that in place basic graph transformations should tell you what this thing looks like right the graph of um let's see so what are we going to do well first of all our a n a sub n looks like 1 over a n sorry a times n plus b to the power of p right and so that is equal to f of n for a function f of x given by 1 over a x plus b to the p okay and that's just some transformed version of 1 over x to the p and 1 over x to the p assuming that p is positive here right typically it's going to look like that right this half will either be here or there depending on whether p is auto or even get something that looks like that so we we get the positive decreasing function that we're supposed to have so we look at the integral we say okay what do we get let's do the indefinite integral first so 1 over a x plus b to the power p integrate with respect to x okay now we know that if if p is equal to one well then we get this is going to give me 1 over a times the natural log of ax plus b and we know that as x goes to infinity that's going to blow up on us okay so we know it diverges if p is equal to 1. so we're going to assume here assume that p is not equal to one well if p is not equal to one then this is just power rule right power rule and chain rule so that is so this is the integral of ax plus b to the minus p we add one to the exponent so we get minus p plus one one minus p if we drop that into the denominator that's going to be ax plus b to the p minus 1 1 over that oh but we also have to divide by a right there's a one over a coming from the chain rule so there's actually a out there okay plus your c if you like okay and so if we're looking at the improper integral so going from 1 to infinity 1 over ax plus b to the p dx okay well we're going to get the limit as n goes to infinity 1 over a times 1 over oh we also have to divide by we have to divide by the new exponent right forgot that um so we also have a p minus 1 in there or maybe minus 1 plus p so we also have that um right yeah so we have that we have minus p plus one we have one over ax plus b to the p minus one there's our or sorry n i guess i called it n there we go um minus the lower limit if we plug in one what do we get at the lower limit we put in x equal to 1 we get you know some constant right minus we get 1 over a times a plus b times 1 minus p it's a constant um and so we look at this and we say yeah this this here limit what can we say about it this limit is going to be equal to zero is long as p minus one is positive and it's going to be equal to infinity if p minus one is negative right we've already ruled out the p is equal to one case um okay so it's going to converge if p minus one is positive which is the same thing as saying that p is bigger than one which is what we had here right and if and only if because if p is not bigger than one then either um it's equal to one and we know it diverges or it's less than one and we know it diverges okay so either way we know that we have a convergent improper integral if p is bigger than one and so correspondingly we have a convergent p series if p is bigger than one so the next theorem that we want to look at is the direct comparison test okay um so we've stated here's a theorem and the this is the sentence which is direct comparison right here okay so this is direct comparison so if you're able to set up a direct comparison this is typically the simplest argument that you can give for convergence of a series i if we have one series which we know converges and it's easy to show that the terms in some other series are always less than or equal to the corresponding terms in the convergence series then this one must automatically converge as well conversely if if this series diverges right and the other series has terms which are larger then it has to diverge as well one thing that is important here is that they do have to be positive sequences okay the fact that they're positive right means that well if we if we let um let's say s n to be the sum n going from 1 to big n of n and let's call the other one i don't know maybe t just because it's the next letter in the alphabet i call t n sum and going from one to n of b n um so if we define these if we have that and that then these sequences sn and tn well they have to be monotone increasing right because we started with positive sequences so every time we add a new term the sum gets bigger okay so they're monotone increasing this is a useful observation to make one thing that tells us is that if we do have a divergence series if this sum diverges okay well it has to diverge to infinity right has to diverge for infinity the other thing we notice is that well s n has to be always less than or equal to t n maybe i should have used a different letter here um let's call that ten or n naught or something okay for n bigger than or equal to this n naught right so we always allow that maybe your comparison doesn't quite work at the beginning but it works eventually right when we can when we're talking about conversions of series we always care about what happens eventually first few terms aren't that important right first hundred terms thousand terms million terms aren't necessarily important it's only what happens eventually that matters okay so maybe this is a big number it doesn't matter as long as we have this eventually okay so what that tells me is that well if the limit as n goes to infinity of s n is infinity then the limit as n goes to infinity of t tn must also be infinity right um if we have this inequality for all n right this quantity is always bigger than that quantity if this is becoming infinite this one must also become infinite you can prove that straight from the definition of the limit if you want okay on the other hand and so by the way this this proves the second part of the theorem right if s n goes to infinity right that's saying that this series diverges which tells us that this one diverges on the other hand if the limit as n goes to infinity of let's say t n is some value let's i don't know call it uh b why not um well what can we say then well we know that s n has to be less than or equal to t n but t n has to be less than or equal to b right because if if tn is an increasing sequence right it's an increasing sequence it has to be less than or equal to its limit okay because it gets bigger as n increases so does so does tn okay well that means that this sequence is bounded and it's increasing so what do we know about bounded increasing sequences we have the monotone convergence theorem says if you have a bounded increasing sequence it has to converge okay so that's exactly the scenario of the first right so that means that that this sequence converges which is the same thing as saying that the series converges and that proves the first part okay in case you're wondering why it's true there's the argument so direct comparison is pretty straightforward it makes intuitive sense right that if if these numbers are always bigger than those numbers if this converges well this should converge to something smaller it makes sense right similarly if this diverges well this should be bigger than that so it should diverge as well makes sense next we'll look at some examples so we can see how we actually apply this in in practice right and the challenge with using direct comparison is here it's getting that inequality right it's easier said than done sometimes it's straightforward and you can see the inequality and you set it up straight away and everyone's happy sometimes it's tough so we'll look at some easy examples we'll look at some tough examples and then just like for improper integrals when direct comparison fails you ask whether or not there's some sort of limit comparison that you can use and fortunately the answer will be yes all right so here is a quick and easy candidate for direct comparison all right we want to decide if this particular series converges or diverges you might say hey i know i know something about geometric series and when they converge i also know some of the p series and when they converge here we seem to have the two of them sort of jumbled together well what do you do there's actually kind of two ways you could do this right you could say well here's one option we could say since 1 over 3 to the n plus n squared is less than 1 over 3 to the n y why is that true well whatever n is right n squared is a positive number if you add a positive number on the denominator right you're making the denominator bigger that makes the whole thing smaller right so this should be a larger number over here and we know that this converges right well we should probably say y it's geometric with r equals onethird which is less than one then we know that our series converges by comparison that's it that's all you got to say right but make sure you check the boxes what are you comparing two the thing that you're comparing to why does it converge it's geometric why do we know the other one converges well because we're using the comparison test right we should also keep an eye on the requirement that terms be positive but we've got that going for us as well okay now of course you could have gone in another direction with this you could have also said hey i don't need to compare to the geometric series i could also compare all right this one gave us two options we could have also said hey 3 to the n over n squared for the same reasoning is less than 1 over n squared right and i know that this series and going from 1 to infinity 1 over n squared that converges y it's a p series p is equal to two which is bigger than one okay we know that this series converges okay same as before okay of course if we had if we only had say n here rather than n squared series is still going to converge but then option one is the only option right we wouldn't have been able to go to option two all right or you know if this was maybe like one half to the n in here or something where the g matrix series failed well again we could just then rely on the p series in this case we had both options at our disposal pick either one all right here's another example with comparison 1 over n minus log n what do we do with that well let's see you should probably suspect that this diverges why we know that the harmonic series 1 over n we know that that diverges right and subtracting something off from n is only going to make the denominator smaller which is going to make the terms in this series bigger which should mean it still diverges and of course that's the whole point of the comparison test right so let's work that through what do we get uh well we notice that n has to be bigger than or equal to n minus the natural log of n okay um we're working here let's point out this is valid for n bigger than or equal to one right if n is less than one the natural log is negative and this side would actually be bigger but n is bigger than or equal to one so we don't have to worry okay n minus log n the other thing we should worry about though are these terms still positive yes they are that is still bigger than zero all right you can use calculus to check this if you want it's a pretty straightforward comparison to show that n is always bigger than log n okay this is always true um simple to set that up and show it so we know that the terms are positive we have that comparison well since both of these are positive we can take reciprocals inequality diverse reverses and we get that 1 over n is less than or equal to 1 over n minus the natural log of n okay very good and now we can say since the harmonic series diverges and you can however you want to reference this you can point out well it's the harmonic series and that was our like classic example of of a series that diverges despite the fact that the terms go to zero right so it's harmonic um or if you want it's a p series with p equal to one and it's not bigger than one so we know it's going to diverge and whichever reason you want to give we know it diverges we know that this series here 1 over n minus log of n that has to also diverge by comparison that's it we're done all right before we move on from direct comparison next topic is going to be the limit comparison test i'm going to do one more example with direct comparison and i want to do this example to try and convince you why the limit comparison test is useful right direct comparison is nice it gets you the answer really fast if you can set up that inequality if you can't set it up easily maybe you want something better so let's look at these two examples now a part a is straightforward okay let's look at the solution for part a for part a i can simply say that 1 over n squared plus n is now of course i can choose to drop either of these two they're both positive right if i remove either one of them from the sum i'm going to get a smaller number in the denominator so a bigger number overall but i want to keep the one that gives me a conversion series right so 1 over n squared and i know that this series here converges and again we know that converges because it's a ptest p is two it's bigger than one we know that this series converges as well and we can give the reason converges by comparison okay that's not so bad um what about part b so here's where things get a little bit tricky the the intuition that you want to apply is that for rational functions large powers dominate right and so we should look at this and say if i ignore the smaller powers this is effectively a p series p is equal to 2 2 is bigger than 1 i expect it should converge right but it's not exactly a p series so we have to try and compare to one right the only other difference you'll notice i started the sum at 2 because 1 minus 1 would give me a 0 in the denominator which is not good but as long as n is bigger than or equal to two n squared minus n is going to be positive so we have you know we have a positive sequence we're good to go on that um but we can't do the same sort of direct comparison that we just did right if we try it it's it's bound to fail because if i just drop the minus n right that subtracting n is making the denominator smaller if i remove it the denominator gets bigger the overall terms get smaller inequality goes the wrong way so i can't i can't use it right it doesn't work so what do we do well you start fiddling around and you just say like how can i how can i get this thing to go the right way so subtracting n how do we how do we fix it you can mess around there are options like maybe you try to complete the square or something like that i mean that actually is an option you could do that completing this square might work we might try to say something like well you know we know that we know that n n is bigger than or equal to 2 in this scenario if i multiply both sides by by n i know that n squared is bigger than or equal to 2n right i can multiply both as an inequality as long as the thing i'm multiplying by is positive and then i could also multiply by one half so onehalf n squared would be greater than or equal to n okay or in other words minus n okay if i reverse the so move this over minus n will be bigger than or equal to minus one half n squared so i just swap the two sides um and now i can add n squared to both sides n squared minus n is bigger than or equal to n squared minus half n squared which is half n squared very good okay so with all that now i can say that i have my solution right so i can say this i can say since n squared minus n is bigger than or equal to one half n squared i know that one over n squared minus n is less than or equal to 2 over n squared and i know that the sum and going from 2 to infinity of 2 over n squared converges again p test the 2 on top is a constant doesn't matter factor it out it's 1 over n squared i know that the sum for n squared minus n also converges and again it's by comparison by direct comparison all right but that direct comparison was a whole lot harder to set up than this one right you had to come up with this and then you probably don't necessarily come up with that idea on the spot right you're in the middle of an exam maybe you're not going to think about that that's where the limit comparison test comes in right limit comparison is the test to use with that intuition that highest powers are dominant right limit comparison says hey i want to compare this with 1 over n squared the direct comparison doesn't seem to be working out for me maybe there's a simpler way to set this up we'll see that in the next couple of videos all right so now we come to the limit comparison test right so it's still sort of a comparison test um setup is the same as direct comparison we have two positive sequences we're looking at convergence of the corresponding series okay and the limit comparison test is essentially trying to set up this this idea that if we kind of know in the long run how the two sequences compare right then sort of smaller differences that might matter for small values of n don't matter so much for larger values of n they're not so important we just wanted to look about sort of this sort of long term comparison how do they compare once n gets really big okay so if the limit of the ratio is l right what that's telling you is that for large values of n the terms in this sequence are roughly some multiple of the terms in this sequence right a n is approximately l times b n where l is some limit right so they they're kind of the same size right same order of magnitude they agree well not order of magnitude is not the right term but um they they're equal up to a constant multiple right and we know that as far as convergence of a series goes constant multiple doesn't matter if there's a constant multiple you can pull it out right and so these two sequence or these two series either they both converge or they both diverge because the the terms here are behave roughly the same as the terms here for long term right and convergence really depends on longterm behavior what happens for large values of n okay so and then of course it could be that you know so l here needs to be it needs to be positive right it can't be zero and it can't be infinity so what happens if it is zero or infinity uh well if the limit is zero what is that telling you that's telling you that these terms here the bns are growing much faster than the ans right so these ones are growing faster so that means that in the long run the bns are larger than the ans okay so now you're kind of back to direct comparison the bns are eventually larger than the ans otherwise that limit wouldn't be zero and so you know that if the sum of the bn's converges well the bn's are bigger than the n so the ands have to converge right essentially you turn it into into direct comparison okay on the other hand if the limit is infinity well that means that the a ends are growing much faster than the bn's right so the ans are larger in the long run and so if you know that this series diverges this one must as well right um so the the strategy here is always that you want to think of this as like the this series here right the a n this is sort of the one that you're given so you want to think of basically this this is like the the given series and this is the one that you're going to compare to right that's your comparison series um and so this might be you know this might be sort of complicated right you're given some complicated series you want to compare to something that is relatively simple something where you know what the answer is you know if it converges or diverges and and you you want them to be sort of roughly similar in in the sense of longterm behavior like if if if this is some rational expression well then you want to look at largest powers of n right and and set this up based on that um all right so typically you're setting things up so that you you're going to be you way back you know the very first chapter of calculus limits you're doing limits at infinity you're setting it up so that you're going to do something like a limit of a rational function with equal powers top and bottom to try and get that l that's that's the most typical scenario for this right but you want to think of the bn is always your sort of test sequence that you're trying to compare against um so just as a as a quick example so that didn't take too long let's look at that one that we just left off with right we had this sequence 1 over n squared minus n sorry and started at 2 because we don't want to divide by 0. and you say okay i want to decide on convergence of this series by comparison but we just saw that direct comparison is a pain really a pain okay so we want to compare to what should we compare to well we look at this and again the the the intuition here the idea you want to apply is to say well look for large values of n the highest power is going to dominate ignore all the rest right so it's to throw the rest away and what you're left with is your comparison so we want to compare this with the sum and going from 2 to infinity of 1 over n squared and we know that this is a convergent p series right okay so we're going to compare to this convergent p series and we simply say okay let's look um my a n is 1 over n squared minus n b n is 1 over n squared so limit n going to infinity a n over b n we have the limit n going to infinity of well so dividing by b n dividing by 1 over n squared is the same as multiplying by n squared so n squared over n squared minus n okay and that limit is 1 right highest degree top and bottom is equal right power 2 top power 2 bottom we look at the coefficients 1 over 1 we know that limit is 1. okay um and 1 is bigger than 0 it's less than infinity so we know that this sorry going from 2 to infinity n squared minus n converges by the limit comparison test right and you know if you were we had the other example we would do is n squared plus n right so if you had n squared plus n um probably you should do direct comparison you can still do limit comparison this exact same thing is going to work if there was a plus here instead of a minus right you're still going to get one for the limit but this is slightly more work than direct comparison if it's an easy direct comparison right so maybe you want to do direct comparison for plus but you should probably do limit comparison for minus because doing a direct comparison for this we saw that that's actually a fair amount of effort limit comparison is relatively straightforward all right so here's an example applying the limit comparison test we wanted to determine the convergence of this series here we've got one over n plus log n okay now you want to set up a you know you want to set a comparison here and i mean the the nicest direct comparison would be to just drop log n right you drop log n um but then things get bigger right this these terms here are smaller than the harmonic series one over n that tells you nothing because harmonic series diverges and have knowing that your terms are less than a divergent series tells you nothing right you need these to either be bigger than a divergent series or smaller than a convergence series and so you need a little bit of intuition you got to decide off the hop do you think this converges or diverges and then choose your sort of comparator um your the series you want to compare to you choose that wisely all right um it's worth pointing out that you know if you um if you get zero for the limit here and maybe this series diverges um well then then you're you don't really get anywhere right that's a sign that you chose a bad series to compare to right similarly here if you get infinity and this converges you get nothing and it's a sign that you didn't choose very well when you chose that series to compare to okay so here probably you say okay i think i think i'm going to compare this to the harmonic series and going from 1 to infinity of 1 over n we know it diverges but again these terms are larger than those right so the comparison direct comparison doesn't go the right way that said we could have done here if you wanted to do direct comparison we might notice this the natural log of n is always smaller than n so this is going to be bigger than or equal to let's make the denominator a little bit bigger makes this thing smaller and plus n which is just 1 over 2n so if you notice that there is a simple direct comparison right this is just half the harmonic series i pull out the one half harmonic series diverges done but maybe you don't notice that right and that's the whole point so we know that this is the harmonic series we know it diverges okay and so maybe you don't make that observation you still want to show that this series diverges you're pretty sure it diverges so we're going to use not direct comparison we're going to do limit comparison okay so a n is 1 over n plus log n b n is 1 over n so our limit looks like this limit and going from n going to infinity again dividing by 1 over n is like multiplying by n and over n plus the natural log of n let's use l'hopital's rule shall we use l'hopital's rule let's use l'hopital's rule right it's infinity over infinity derivative of n is 1 i mean think of it as x if you want 1 1 1 over n okay n is going to infinity 1 over n is going to go to 0. again we get 1 for the limit so we're in that first case right the limit is 1 so either both diverge or both converge in this case we know that that one diverges so we know that this series diverges from one to infinity by limit comparison okay and we're done all right here's our next example we're going to determine the conversions of this series here which again has sort of one geometric term and a p series term minus instead of plus we already dealt with the plus sign example that was like our very first example that we did right we said hey we can compare with either the geometric or the p series simple inequality direct comparison done the minus sign makes it a lot harder to set up direct comparison so we say okay how else can we determine the convergence um maybe we try for a limit comparison and now of course if you're going to try for a limit comparison you got to decide what are you going to compare two the geometric part the p series part um probably safer to compare with the geometric part exponential functions grow a lot faster than polynomial functions so the 3 to the n is going to dominate long term so we compare to that right so solution looks like this okay so we have a n is 1 over 3 to the n minus n squared and we want to compare to bn and our bn will be 1 over 3 to the n okay and we should probably point out that this is if we do the corresponding series n equals 1 to infinity 1 over 3 to the n is convergent because it's geometric right it's a convergent geometric series we're good to go all right let's take the limit the limit and going trinity a n over b n again dividing by the reciprocal we multiply by 3 to the n through the n minus n squared once again infinity over infinity if we use l'hopital's rule twice right first time around oh you know what let's just do it because it's an exponential but it's not base e it's base 3 we get 3 to the n log 3 3 to the n log three minus two n okay i mean we should put the little h here let me tell the rule and we're gonna do left hill's rule one more time limit and going to infinity 3 to the n times log 3 now squared don't worry about it it's a constant 3 to the n log 3 squared minus 2 let n go to infinity the minus two doesn't matter right we get one in the limit and usual story maybe i'll i'll skip writing down the answer because i want to tell you one more thing but from here we say okay the limit is one so that's our l l is bigger than zero it's less than infinity we know that this series converges now we know that this series converges by limited comparison now you might have been wondering what if you what have you kind of like i don't know you messed up it's not really messed up but maybe you decided to compare with n squared instead right what if you did if you did bn equals 1 over n squared you say hey that's that gives me a convergent p series what would i get then well if i did that then a n over b n i would get instead i would get n squared over 3 to the n minus n squared and we try to take the limit and again you can use l'hopital's rule a couple of times and you find that this is going to go to zero as n goes to infinity um right we don't get a finite value we get zero so did limit comparison did it fail not exactly puts us in case two limit is zero the bn series converges right it's a convergent p series so we know the ans converge as well okay either way it works that's the nice thing about limit comparison there's a fair amount of wiggle room there's cushion built in right it's not quite as sensitive to small mistakes one way or the other limit comparison is sort of a blunt instrument it gets the job done okay so here's our last example using limit comparison it's the last example for this section on limit and comparison tests we want to determine the convergence of this series here right and now um the point that we've tried to drive home with the the examples we've done so far is it limit comparison right it's sort of a blunt instrument it's not particularly sensitive to the small details right we we only really care about sort of largest powers and so here if we're thinking about long run behavior we say what's going to dominate when n is big adding 3 is not going to matter neither is adding 1. neither is subtracting n when you're comparing to n squared right it's just this root n over n squared this stuff here this is the part that matters for large n okay and so we say let's compare so we want to compare a n which is root n plus 3 over n squared minus n plus 1 to b n which will be root n over n squared which is so that's n to the one half n squared right so 2 minus a half is one over n to the three over two okay okay so let's look the limit as n goes to infinity and over b n is going to be the limit n goes to infinity so let's put a n in there root n plus 3 n squared minus n plus 1. and we're dividing by bn which means multiplying by n to the three over two okay so if we multiply that through we get the limit n going to infinity of n squared plus 3 n to the 3 over 2 divided by n squared minus n plus 1. and that limit is one using the typical argument that we just have to look at the largest powers ratio of the coefficients when those largest powers are equal right okay so that limit is one we're in the first case and now we say oh what do we know about the bns um this series n going from one to infinity and one over oops sorry n to the 3 over 2 does it converge or diverge it converges right it's a p series p is equal to three over two which is bigger than one we know that our original series root n plus three n squared minus n plus one it must also converge using the limit comparison test okay that's it but again the point is that you do not want to be handling something like that by direct comparison right limit comparison gives you a straightforward way of setting up a comparison letting you compare a complicated series with a simple one where we have a known result and all it's going to cost you is a limit at infinity using techniques that you learned in calc 1. all right so our next topic is the ratio test so the ratio test is stated here is a theorem again the assumption is that we're dealing with a positive sequence so our series is summing positive terms we aren't alternating signs at all and the ratio test gives you a simple thing to consider it says just look at the ratio of consecutive terms in your sequence a n plus 1 over a n if that limit comes out to a value which is less than one you know your sequence converges if it's bigger than one the series diverges sorry i said sequence meant series so series converges if l is less than one diverges if l is bigger than one and if you actually get one on the nose then the ratio test fails right so the test tells you nothing if that limit happens to be equal to one um so one of the things that's kind of important now that we're sort of building up our arsenal of tests right we have geometric series now we have p series telescoping series i mean there's not really a test there you just have to recognize it as telescoping we have the integral test we have comparison test limit comparison now ratio soon root right um solving problems involving sequences in series is all about choosing the right tool for the job and it's about doing enough problems that you're able to recognize what the right tool is going to be okay so for example the ratio test is not the right tool for a p series right if you think about a p series right if my a n is is 1 over n to the p right and if i was looking at well what do i get for a n plus 1 over a n well i'm going to get n over n plus 1 to the p after a bit of simplifying right and that's going to go to 1 in the limit right so the ratio test is useless for p series but that's okay because we already know how to handle p series right we just have to look at that value of p is it bigger than one or is it less than one right um so the ratio test is not helpful for p series but it is helpful for a lot of other series in particular ratio test definitely takes care of geometric series right think about a geometric series if n looks like r to the n right well then a n plus 1 over a n is going to be r to the n plus one over r to the n which is r um and as we already know geometric series converges precisely for for positive r converges precisely when r is less than one okay we can see that again with the ratio test in fact the way you actually understand why the ratio test works the way you would prove it is is using something that is sort of based on the geometric series test it's realizing that okay you know what is what are we really saying when we say that the limit as n goes to infinity of a n plus 1 over a n is equal to l well this sort of means that you know a n plus 1 is approximately a n times l for large n right and if you think about well okay so this is i mean this is not a proof by any means but just think of it this way so so a n plus 1 is just l times a n right and then a n plus 2 would be l times a n plus 1 would be l times l times a n and you can sort of you know get from here to say well that means that you know a n plus k is like a n times l to the k right and so then you sort of think about what happens as k gets really large and you say well this is more or less behaving like a geometric series right it's not exactly a geometric series because you know this is only an approximation it's not exact but with the definition of the limit right if you bring in you know the epsilon definition of the limit we can say for a large enough n we can make the difference between this ratio and l less than epsilon we can work out what that means and we can make this precise right so this is one way to think about why the ratio test works it's essentially taking much more general series and in a sense comparing them to a geometric series right but using the machinery of a limit to set up that comparison okay so that's one way to understand why it works certainly not a proof but it gives you some idea of the concept with that under our belts we'll move on and we'll look at some examples all right so here's our first example with the ratio test three series one two three i put three over here short on space um we want to see if we can use the ratio test to determine convergence of these series now the ratio test tends to work really well for things like powers and factorials right um you know exponential so we mentioned that you know the ratio test is sort of closely related to geometric series so when you see exponential functions you expect that the the ratio test is probably going to be good for for factorials the reason why the ratio test works really well for factorials is you might recall that the factorial can be defined sort of recursively right n plus 1 factorial can be written as n plus 1 times n factorial that observation frequently comes in handy because in this case we would say that our a n okay a n is 2 to the n over n factorial and so we want to set up this ratio a n plus 1 over a n so that's going to look like 2 to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 factorial divide by a n we just multiply by the reciprocal okay n factorial over 2 to the n right and now we can see that there's there's some cancellation that goes on right 2 to the n plus 1 of course we can might as well why not mention that one two though i think everyone knows this 2 to the n plus 1 we can always write as 2 times 2 to the n right laws of exponents n plus 1 so 2 to the n times 2 to the 1. there we go and so we see that actually quite a bit cancels here 2 to the n is going to cancel with all but one of those twos the n factorial cancels with well the factorial if you like right this n plus 1 factorial is n plus 1 times n plus n factorial cancel the factorials and we see that the limit as n goes to infinity of n plus 1 over a n well it turns out once you simplify that's just the limit of two over n plus one and that limit is zero zero is definitely less than one and so our conclusion here is that the series converges okay so far so good moving on to the next one now for this next one there there are ways to answer this without maybe even applying a test depending on how comfortable you are with the sort of longterm behavior of various different types of functions right one of the things that you might have encountered if you've been playing around with these things is that factorials grow much faster than exponential functions right because two to the n every time you mult you know increase n by one you're multiplying by two up here but down here you're multiplying by one larger right first you're multiplying by two over two then two over three then two over four then two over five right so this this is getting bigger on the bottom right exponential functions in turn they grow much faster than power functions and power polynomials in general right so we expect that actually here the numerator is growing faster than the denominator and you could just apply this sort of basic test for divergence right you could say well look at a n here is 3 to the n over n cubed and you could say hey look the um the limit as this the limit of a n as n goes to infinity the limit of this thing it's it's actually infinite because it's infinity over infinity but use l'hopital's rule three times you're just left with six on the bottom you'll still have three to the n on top it's going to go to infinity right um so so this series here fails that most basic test for divergence right which says that the only you know if the terms in your sequence that you're summing right if the ans if they don't go to zero you know that your series diverges um so this is enough of an observation to point out that the series has to diverge okay because it goes to infinity of course you could also you know we're supposed to be practicing the ratio test right so we could also see this from the ratio test if we look at well what is a n plus 1 over a n so this is my a n here and so if i put n plus 1 in there i get 3 to the n plus 1 n plus 1 cubed times so 1 over a n will be n cubed over over 3 to the n okay so that's going to give me 3 times n cubed over n plus 1 cubed and in the limit that's going to go to 1 1 times 3 goes to 3 3 is bigger than 1 so ratio test says it diverges right okay so we can do that what about this one here now this is very similar to the p series we talked about in the last video we said ratio test is useless for this and you can go ahead and you can check the ratio test is useless if you try to apply the ratio test you're going to get a rational function and it's going to have the same power top and bottom it's going to be n squared the limit is going to be 1 ratio test fails but we don't need the ratio test for this we know that this converges this converges by comparison right it converges by comparison with the p series 1 over n squared because 1 over n squared plus 1 is slightly smaller than 1 over n squared right so the ratio test is not always the right tool for the job even here even something like this where it really looks like you know it's the right sort of you know ratio test loves power function loves not power functions but exponential functions um it's the sort of form that works for a ratio test and yes you can use rescue tests but maybe you don't need to right as as you move through tests of sort of higher and higher degrees of sophistication sometimes you forget that you can come back to these very simple rules that we started out with they can also do the job for you all right so here's a more challenging example we've got a lot of factorials in there ratio test is the right tool for the job when you see factorials frequently is at least um but i mean n factorial you know we've got the square of n factorial on the top on the bottom now be careful that's not just twice n factorial right if it was just 2 times n factorial we'd cancel we'd simplify a piece of cake no this means we we double n and then we take the factorial right um so 2n factorial is is way way way bigger than n factorial right is it bigger than n factorial squared um yeah of course because here you multiply by the first n integers and then you multiply by the first n integers again down here you multiply by the first n integers and then you multiply by the next n integers it's a lot bigger okay so the denominator is definitely larger than the numerator seems like maybe it's going to work out for us but let's let's apply the ratio test and be sure okay so let's see a n in this case is n factorial n factorial 2 n factorial and so let's look what do we get when we do a n plus 1 over a n so we have n plus 1 factorial n plus 1 factorial over 2 so do it this way 2 times n plus 1 factorial that's going to be 2n plus 2 factorial on the bottom right okay multiply by 1 over a n so we flip this thing over 2n factorial n factorial n factorial okay so remember now that n plus one factorial we can write as n plus one times n factorial we do that twice so n plus one squared n factorial squared on the bottom this is two n plus two so it's two n plus two times two n plus one times two n factorial okay then we have 2n factorial n factorial squared if we want to write it like that and now we look for cancellations and there are a lot of them those cancel that cancels okay and we're just left with n plus 1 squared over 2n plus 2 times two n plus one um you can probably see how that's going to go but maybe just to make things crystal clear let's multiply these things out okay four n squared plus two n plus four n six n plus two okay so what's the limit the limit as n goes to infinity of a n plus one over a n well it's one over four all right it's a rational function top degree is n squared top and bottom and 1 over 4 is less than 1 and that means that the series converges by the ratio test there we go all right so next up is the root test root test looks an awful lot like the ratio test in fact all i had to do is come through and change a few pieces here right so in the root test it's called the root test because you look at the nth root of a n right as n goes to infinity so both the the degree of the root goes up as n increases right so another way to write that usually more convenient is to write that as a n to the power 1 over n right so we're looking at increa fractional powers with increasingly large denominator okay and we're letting n go to infinity here now it looks a lot like the ratio test and with good reason this is yet another variation on the theme of geometric series right notice that if a n is r to the n well then a n to the one over n is r to the n to the one over n which is just r right and we know that a geometric series is going to converge for r less than one it's going to diverge for or bigger than one of course if it's a geometric series on the nose we also know it diverges for r equal to one but it's not exactly a geometric series here so we can't really say anything if our you know if this limit is equal to one right um so the idea here is that well if if a n to the one over n right um if n is large sufficiently large right a n to the 1 over n is approximately equal to the limit l whatever it has happens to be and that suggests that a n something you know it goes something like l to the n so it really is again trying to take whatever series you have and approximate it by a geometric series and then use what we know about geometric series to decide on convergence at the limit that's the strategy here okay and again it's not on the nose it's only approximate but it gives you an idea of what's going on one reminder for positive constants if you think about taking roots of constants um for numbers that are between zero and one if you take the root of a number between zero and one it actually gets a little bit bigger right like square root of a quarter is a half take the square root of a number that's bigger than one it gets smaller um so for a positive constant if you take that constant to the power one over n and ask where it goes it goes to 1 as n goes to infinity that's often a useful observation to make of course you can show that using calculus if you like but we'll just make that as an observation in case it comes up in some of the following examples all right so we'll end this section by looking at a few examples that apply the root test to determine convergence now one of the things you'll probably find as you're working through problems is that you don't use the root test nearly as often as you use the ratio test right 19 times out of 20 you probably go for the ratio test over the root test um but there are scenarios where the root test is much more effective here's one i think where it's probably clear that it's easy to use the root test because and well a n is three n plus one over five n minus two to the power of n and if we wanna now take that and raise it to the power 1 over n right well those two exponents they cancel each other out right nth power nth root those cancel we just get three n plus one over five n minus two well that means that the limit as n goes to infinity of a n to the one over n well this is rational same power top and bottom we look at the coefficients the limit is three over five three over five is less than one and that means the series converges okay that works out for us now you could probably also do this using you could try using the ratio test i think you would find that ratio test will also work for you root test just happens to be cleaner in this particular case okay if we look at the next one a n we have n to the fourth over log n to the nth power so again we're going to raise that to the power 1 over n okay and what we get is we get n to the 4 oops sorry 1 over n let's be careful here we get n to the 4 over n on top we get the natural log of n on the bottom uh now one of the results that actually um i mentioned this before if you have a constant to the one over n you let n go into infinity that's typically going to go to one okay that's kind of clear right i mean if n goes to infinity 1 over n is going to go to 0 constant raised to the power of 0 should give you 1. it's actually also true though that if you take n to the power 1 over n that will also go to 1 as n goes to infinity and n to the four over n will just be well n to the one over n raised to the fourth power one to the fourth power still one okay um so if you take the limit of this one as n goes to infinity so we have n to the 4 over n divided by log n well this limit is going to be zero okay because the top is approaching one the bottom goes to infinity one over infinity gives you gives you zero right um if you want to go into detail on this you can play around with indeterminate forms l'hopital's rule um i mean the whole thing is not even indeterminate right one over infinity is not indeterminate we get zero the main thing is making sure that you can see that that top is actually going to one if this isn't clear to you remember you can always rewrite let me just put this as an aside you can always say hey you know what n to the 4 over n i can write as e to the log of n to the 4 over n but then the 4 over n comes down you get that right and if you let n go to infinity log n over n goes to zero e to the zero is one that's where the one comes from okay coming to the last one let's try the last one um a n to the 1 over n is going to be 2 to the n to the 1 over n divided by n squared to the 1 over n so we get 2 over n to the 2 over n and using the same reasoning as here this is going to go to 1 that's just a 2. that goes to 2 2 is bigger than 1. right probably forgot to mention in this case here right limit is 0 well 0 is less than 1. so that second series also converges the third one diverges right we get 2 for the limit 2 is bigger than 1 root test says it says it diverges and by the way for that third one you probably in practice don't use the root test test for divergence the simple test for divergence tells you already that this series has to diverge because if you take the limit of just the sequence as n goes to infinity already you get infinity right 2 to the n grows a lot faster than n squared the terms don't go to zero end of story you could also do the ratio test ratio test would be easy to apply here but the root test also gets the job done all right so the next topic we want to look at is alternating series so the definition is here an alternating series is a series of one of the following forms so we have these a n's are still kind of positive so you still start with a positive sequence like usual um but you put this sign factor in front right so minus 1 to the n right that alternates sign if it's if n is even this is plus 1 if n is odd that's minus 1 swaps back and forth in sine so this is how you you see the terms right so this is going to be you know this would be like minus a1 plus a2 minus a3 plus a4 and so on right so the sign changes um if you want the first term to be positive then you do minus one to the n plus one right so either way we consider it an alternating series whether the first term is positive or negative doesn't matter what matters is that the sign alternates between positive and negative okay now the surprising thing is that for alternating series right we we know that this condition here on its own this condition is not sufficient for convergence right we've seen this we've seen that the series sum of n going from one to infinity one over n this diverges all right this is the harmonic series okay harmonic series diverges the p series with p is equal to one there are other ways to prove it but this you know integral test does it but there are direct proofs as well that is a divergent series despite the fact that the terms go to zero okay but nonetheless if we have a sequence where the ans are positive right so this uh oh let's be careful hahaha i forgot the minus one all right hope you weren't watching the video and turn it off before we got to that correction okay we need the minus one to the n in there minus 1 to the n times a n it needs to be an alternating series right so the a n's are positive so that this becomes alternating for an alternating series as long as the ends are positive and they're decreasing then it turns out it is good enough to have the ans go to zero right so this harmonic series diverges but the alternating harmonic series and going from one to infinity minus 1 to the n plus 1 over n that converges right happens to converge in fact to the natural log of 2 if you can believe it right so we'll we'll encounter this a number of times right where the alternating series will converge but the corresponding nonalternating series if you drop the sine factor and you just look at the sum of the a n's without the minus 1 to the n in front right whether that minus 1 to the n that series may very well diverge but you simply put this alternating sign in there and suddenly the series converges which is kind of interesting and the idea is that you sort of if you're looking at the partial sums you sort of you know you start with let's say a1 is positive right so you start it like here's zero right and and you add a one so you're kind of out here here's a1 right and now you subtract a2 but when you subtract a2 you know you get to a2 is less than a1 so we don't make it all the way back to here maybe we make it to here right and there's a1 minus a2 and then we add on a3 so we get a bit bigger all right um a1 minus a2 plus a3 right i mean maybe we go even further but you know a3 is less than a2 so we don't make it past where we were before right we make it out to there or maybe up to there and then we subtract and we get a bit smaller and so you kind of you're moving back and forth back and forth but the amount that you're adding or subtracting is getting smaller every time right and so if you look at the partial sums when n is odd in this scenario here the partial sub n is odd you know they start big but they get smaller so you have a you have a decreasing sequence that's bounded below by zero right and if you look at the even terms you have an increasing sequence that's bounded above say by a1 right so you've got two bounded monotone sequences you know that they have to converge and the main thing is showing that they converge to the same limit um once you've established that you get this theorem okay so we'll look at a few examples we'll see how the alternating series test applies and then when we come back to this question of you know convergence of the alternating series versus the corresponding nonalternating series this gets us to absolute convergence absolute convergences well what happens if you take the absolute value drop the minus sign do you still have convergence or not right that's going to be an important question the other thing that we we don't have time to talk is an interesting thing but it's beyond the scope of a calculus curse turns out that in cases where the alternating series converges but the nonalternating series doesn't this is referred to as conditional convergence um and it turns out that conditional convergence is sort of a it's a fragile thing it depends on the order in which you write down the terms which is kind of an odd thing to think about but it sort of comes to playing around with you know if you added a whole bunch of the positive terms and then some of the negative and then a bunch more the positive and then some of the negative ones um there's a surprising thing it's an interesting theorem that one can prove it's a very difficult theorem but it can be done once you have an alternating series you can rearrange the order in which the terms appear to get any real number you want which is bizarre right for for a term for a series with only positive terms you get a limit and that limit is unique there's only one possible value but for alternating series just changing the order around gets you different answers it's bizarre it's a strange thing beyond beyond what we can talk about in a calculus course but if you go on and you take a course in let's say real analysis you might get to play with some of these ideas all right so here are three series we want to know whether the alternating series test sometimes abbreviate ast now we want to know if it can be applied the first one is the one we just talked about it's the alternating harmonic series right the underlying sequence if we ignore the minus 1 to the n plus 1 is just a n is is one over n and so let's see this is is positive it's decreasing and we also know that the limit as n goes to infinity of a n is zero right so we check those three boxes right um and this is the interesting thing about alternating series tests you are just checking boxes right it's it's there's hypotheses there's a conclusion right so there are three things in the hypothesis sequence is positive sequence is decreasing sequence has zero for the limit if you can check those three boxes your sequence converges okay so that's it we know it converges um as i mentioned later on we'll see that it converges to natural log of 2 but for now we know at least that it converges okay what about this next one well we've got the appropriate form right we've got the minus 1 to the n log n over n so a n is log n over n um so let's see we need to check positive we need to check decreasing and we need to check the limit all right so let's have a look is it a positive sequence um well okay log of one is zero so the first term is zero but after that we're fine so let's say positive sometimes we allow zero for positive it's at least nonnegative what about decreasing if you try the first couple values of n you might find that it's going up right so then you get a little bit worried you're like oh it's not decreasing it looks like the values are going up can't apply the alternating series test on the other hand the limit is zero right simple application of l'hopital's rule will tell you that it's infinity over infinity as n goes to infinity take the derivative of the top you get one over n bottom is just one that limit goes to zero check but it doesn't seem to be decreasing so you worry that you can't apply the alternating series test but let's let's take a look at if you take a look at the function right you look at f of x if f x is log x over x then f prime of x if we do the quotient rule we get the derivative of the top 1 over x times the bottom x 1 over x times x is 1 minus top times the derivative of the bottom just log x bottom squared well that's going to be less than zero for log x bigger than one which is the same thing as saying that x has to be bigger than well e is not an integer but um it'll work for three right um so it's decreasing for n bigger than or equal to 3 and that's good enough right nobody cares about the first couple terms right if you're deciding on convergence the first couple terms is not going to change whether or not the series converges you just drop them off the end figure out the rest works out as long as it's eventually decreasing you're fine okay so that works but then we come to this last one we've got sine of n over n squared okay the absolute value make sure that things are positive so we've got that again definitely the limit is zero right because this is bounded and n squared is going to go to infinity but it's not decreasing okay the terms are not decreasing because sine of n is going to oscillate between 0 and 1. it's going to take values between 0 and 1 and it's going to keep doing that forever right as n goes off to infinity there are going to be values that are close to one they're going to be values that are close to zero right um so yeah it's bouncing around on us it's not it's not strictly decreasing and there's no way to make it strictly decreasing so in this case um we're out of luck maybe it still converges in fact it does we'll see soon that uh if the c cons if the series converges without the minus one to the n in there this will be called absolute convergence if you can show it converges without that term then it converges with if you put that term in okay so it does converge um and it converges just by comparison with the p series right 1 over n squared so it converges but you can't establish that convergence using the alternating series test you need to use a different theorem to show that it converges all right so the next result we want to talk about is the approximation theorem for alternating series the theorem's a bit of a mouthful but the idea is pretty simple okay the idea is that you can actually approximate an alternating series pretty well by any of its partial sums right so remember that to to satisfy the hypotheses of the alternating series test the terms in this sequence they have to be positive they have to be decreasing and they have to go to zero in the limit right so these numbers are getting smaller and smaller they're getting closer and closer to zero okay because your alternating in sign as you add them we talked about in the very first video for this section we said well you know what what happens is you know you kind of have you know maybe somewhere here is like the actual limit of your sequence right and so you kind of put the first term in and so maybe maybe like zero is over here right maybe here is zero and you add you add a1 and you get to here and then you subtract a2 right and so then you subtract off a2 and well a2 has to be smaller than a1 so it doesn't get you all the way back to zero maybe it gets you to there all right and so maybe we'll we'll kind of think about it like this way we'll sort of think about the difference from l so a2 gets you to here all right there's a1 plus or a1 sorry minus a2 right and then you add on a3 you add a3 onto here and because a3 is smaller than a2 it's not going to get you all the way back to a1 it's going to get you maybe to here right okay so here will be a1 minus a2 plus a3 and then you subtract off a4 and a4 well it can't take you back that far because it's smaller than a 3 was so maybe it gets you to say here right so then you're kind of over here and there's there's a1 minus a2 plus a3 minus a4 and now you add on a5 and it can't take you all the way back to there so maybe a5 gets you to there right and so on so let's call this maybe to simplify that should be now s5 right the fifth partial sum right and then s6 might be here s7 might be might be there right so you get closer and closer to l every at every you're jumping back and forth over the limit and every time the jumps get smaller right so that means the the difference between the partial sum that you have here and the limit right well it's always got to be less than the next term because then when you add the next term it takes you to the other side of the limit right it takes you past the limit past the limit so the difference between the limit and the partial sum right the limit of this so the actual series or the infinite series the difference between them it's always less than the next term in the sequence so that's a really useful result that means if you you know if you want to approximate a series because calculating the actual sum of an infinite series is in general very difficult right i mean there's lots of them where we don't even know what the value is but we can figure out what it is approximately because it's easy to calculate the next term in the in the sequence right if we have a formula for the sequence we can calculate the next term figure out how big it is and what that sort of lets us do is say hey this gives us sort of a bound on the error right and that means if we if it's good enough to know the sum of the series accurate to let's say three decimal places well we just have to keep going until these numbers are small enough right once they're less than you know one over five thousand then we know we've got the answer accurate to to five decimal places right and in fact we can we can always just kind of look at the two partial sums consecutive partial sums the limits always in between them right so you just kind of look at consecutive partial sums until the interval between them is small enough and you know that you've got the you know the error that you want right so that's the idea we'll look at a couple of examples and then we'll move on we'll talk about absolute convergence after this all right so we're going to introduce a little bit more terminology here um we'll talk about convergent um series and we're talking two different types of convergence now absolute conversions versus conditional convergence so series converges absolutely if you can take the absolute value of every term in the sequence and the series still converges okay it converges conditionally if this if the series converges but once you take the absolute value it no longer converges right so the the standard example of course is the alternating harmonic series right so the alternating harmonic series minus 1 to the n over n well that converges conditionally right we know that that series converges by the alternating series test but we also know that if we take the absolute value right what happens if you take the absolute value of minus one to the n you just get one right so the absolute value gives you the harmonic series and we know that the harmonic series diverges okay so that's an example of a conditionally convergence here a series okay main results on conditional versus absolute convergence well we have a theorem and the theorem states and you can maybe guess based on the definition that um if a series converges absolutely then it just converges it'll stop right so in other words if the series with the absolute values converges then the corresponding series without the absolute value will also converge right so absolute convergence is a much stronger condition than simple convergence right any absolutely convergence series will converge but conditionally convergent series don't necessarily converge absolutely so this is an important result this comes in handy in a lot of scenarios and and we also mentioned another thing that comes up and again we're not going to address this in a calculus course but if a series converges absolutely alternating or otherwise an absolutely convergent series converges to unique limit there's only one possible value whereas as i mentioned a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged and so you can tell with different rearrangements of this series and there's there's a whole sort of you know section you could study on rearrangements and what can you do there and and you can go through this proof that um you can get any number you want by rearranging a conditionally conversion series which seems really bizarre happens to be true so next up what we want to do is we just want to look at a few examples to see if we can if we can apply this definition and tell the difference between convergent and absolutely convergent series all right so here are three examples of alternating series and we want to decide if they converge absolutely or only conditionally or perhaps not at all looking at the first one right if we if we look at our terms a n n plus 3 over n squared plus 2n plus 5. well we might notice that those are approximately 1 over n for n large right so okay we can do limit comparison right using limit comparison we know that this is going to diverge if we take the absolute value right so without the absolute value we know that that this if we take the absolute value sorry taking the absolute value we know that this diverges right and we do a simple limit comparison for that but it does converge terms are positive they go to zero in the limit and they're decreasing you can check you can use you can use the derivative right we can take the function look at the derivative figure out where it's where it's decreasing it's more work than we can fit on the board here but you can check that they that this does satisfy the conditions of the alternating series test so it is a convergent alternating series um um so in this case we get converges so this will be conditional convergence all right converges conditionally because this does converge alternating series test says that it does but if you drop the minus one to the n it diverges okay it's essentially the alternating harmonics series with a bit of clutter very good moving on to this one um well here we've got that exponential on the bottom we expect that's probably going to win out over a polynomial on the top so we might suspect absolute convergence in this case and if we look at a n to be n squared plus 2n plus 5 over 2 to the n this looks like something where maybe we'd use ratio test right ratio possibly root root is going to get ugly with that polynomial though so let's do ratio right a n plus 1 over a n we get n plus one squared plus two times n plus one plus five over two to the n plus one multiply by two to the n over n squared plus two n plus five okay so that's going to be one half times this polynomial which we can we can multiply the whole thing out if we care to i use n squared 2n to n 4n plus 1 plus 2 plus 5 something like that details don't really matter down here do they um n squared plus two n plus five okay so if we wanted to apply the ratio test we take the limit of that thing as n goes to infinity uh it's going to go to one half as n goes to infinity and so this one is absolutely convergent by the ratio test right um frequently when we're applying the ratio test test uh we we often use the ratio test as a test for absolute convergence so if if we do have sine factors to deal with we just take the absolute value when we apply the ratio test you're going to see that in the next section when we talk about power series okay the last one well okay the last one diverges we don't have to do any work why does it diverge look at the terms here as n goes to infinity that's going to three over five right so the limit doesn't go to zero right it fails the test for divergence if the uh if a n doesn't go to zero and then goes to infinity we know it can't possibly converge absolutely or otherwise this one just diverges full stop the next topic we want to look at is tailored polynomials now depending on on how your calculus course is sequenced this might be something that you're looking at in the chapter on derivative applications immediately following differentials or it might be something that you're seeing in the context of sequences in series and you've just looked at power series and we're trying to make our way towards taylor series so we'll try to do this so it fits both and we'll probably take this perspective of we're moving on from the linear approximation right the tangent line approximation and we're trying to improve that approximation right and then whether you're thinking this is an application of derivatives or whether you're you're thinking about why taylor series makes sense in either context this will uh this will work out all right so we know that this linear approximation right it works well it works well as long as we stay close to this point right so there's some point you know c here and so if we go from c to c plus delta x then yeah there's not much difference between the y values along the curve and the y values along the tangent but only in some little interval here right once we move out to say here that gap's getting big out here the gap's getting bigger once we're out here the gap is huge right and it's a terrible approximation right it's only a good approximation on a fairly small interval right so if you're interested in improving your approximation there are two choices that you have one is to shrink the interval over which you're making that approximation right you say well look once delta x hits 0.5 the approximation is not good enough let's get down to 0.1 let's get down to 0.01 right but maybe you can't reach the values you need to reach by shrinking the interval maybe you need to approximate the function out here using values of the function over here right so that might not be an option so if you can't shrink the interval you look for better ways of approximating right so we know that if we have this l of x right so this is going to be f of c plus f prime of c times x minus c and this is the linear approximation right so the next thing you might ask is can we do can we do something like i don't know let's call it q q for quadratic right could we do something like q of x equals and i don't know maybe the coefficients are going to look different but maybe there's a there's an a0 term right a1 we'll work in powers of x minus c you'll see that's going to be convenient right and and maybe now we go to a second order term right and so we say okay is there is there such a thing as a quadratic approximation can we do that does that even make sense um all right so of course adding on that second order term gives some curvature right we know the second derivative is where you start curving away from just being a line so maybe maybe this quadratic right maybe it does something like this all right all right so you get a better approximation for a larger range of x values that's what we're hoping for okay um maybe you can go to cubic right maybe you can go to maybe like there's a c of x all right so there's like a like a b zero plus b one plus b2 b3 times x minus c cubed right maybe there's a cubic and what's that going to look like right so so you play around and you you try to figure this out like can we can we make these approximations and and how are they going to look and maybe the cubic right maybe the cubic does something like you know maybe the cubic does something like that right and you you improve the approximation a little bit more that's what we're trying to accomplish with taylor polynomials that's where we're heading okay is we want to we want to introduce polynomials of higher and higher degree so that we improve on the linear approximation right so we're going to keep adding you know we'll do linear then quadratic then cubic then maybe degree 4 degree 5 degree 6. we'll keep going until we cover as much of the original graph as we need to and as closely as we need to right so the idea is as we add terms we hope that two things happen one is that over the original interview interval that we had our approximation is better than what we had before but also that we can widen the interval and have a reasonable approximation for a a wider range of x values okay we want those two things to happen so in the next video we'll play around with this we'll talk about well how do you decide what these coefficients should be how do we kind of you know get things so that it's a good fit and once we play around with that we're going to arrive at the formula for the coefficients in what's called a taylor polynomial then we'll be able to look at some examples okay so in the last video we introduced this idea that maybe if we if we start adding some higher degree terms onto our linear approximation we can improve over that original tangent line approximation right we can we can get some some curves that match the original graph better and for a better range of values so the problem becomes one of determining what these coefficients should be right and if you're wondering why i chose powers of x minus c rather than simply powers of x well that's because we want to make the comparison at this value x minus or x equals c right so it's nice to be able to just plug in x equals c and of course if you do that all these terms are going to go away right so so let's say we wanted to find q of x what are some things that we're going to require well the minimum requirement that we should put on this thing is that it should agree with the original function at that point right so at c we should have equality exact equality so q of c should equal f of c right makes sense right they should they should touch at that point okay so that means that f of c should be equal to well a zero right because if i put x equals c in here i get zero 0 right so q of c is just a 0 right so now we know what a 0 should be ok what's the next sort of reasonable thing that you might ask um well we probably want them to have the same tangent line at that point right we want we want them to have the same slope as they pass through right if i if i had my curve and i was trying to approximate by a quadratic that agreed at that point but the slopes didn't agree right i probably have something that looks like that that's not going to be a good approximation right so the two curves should be tangent to each other at x equals c well how do i guarantee that the curves are tangent to each other their first derivatives should be equal so q prime of c should be equal to f prime of c right but what's q prime of c well we can just we can take the derivative um this is a constant term so it goes away q prime of c well let's say q prime of x to begin with q prime of x is going to be a 1 times the derivative of x minus c which is just 1. so this is just a 1 right here we can use the power rule plus chain rule 2 comes down in front 2 times a 2 times x minus c times 1 right the derivative of the inside is just 1. so that means that q prime of c is well again this is going to go to 0 so q prime of c is just a 1 and that's what we want to be f prime of c okay so notice what we have so far right this is going to be f of c f prime of c times x minus c so far it looks exactly like the linear approximation but we have this one more term right so now we come to well how do we deal with that last term again we we say okay so we want we want the quadratic to be tangent right so but there's lots of ways that we might set things up so that a quadratic is tangent right maybe we have it kind of come in and and it does i don't know sort of something like this right um that doesn't look like a graph of a function but still the next thing that you want is is you want to say something about the curvature right so for example if we're if we were looking let's say at a maximum or a minimum right i could draw i could draw a quadratic like this right and it would be tangent these two curves are tangent to each other they have the same function value they have the same first derivative at that point right but their second derivatives are way off they're not even the same sign right so the next thing that you probably want is you want to make sure that they kind of curve the same at that point and we know that curvature is concavity is second derivative so the second derivative of q should equal the second derivative of f okay and we say what's q double prime well we just take the derivative here that's the constant it goes away right the constant term always disappears then we have 2 a 2 well times 1. okay so this of course that's a constant so that's also the value of q prime of c so q prime of c is 2 a 2 and we want that to equal f prime of c and that means that a 2 we have to divide by 2 right or f double prime should be f double prime of c over 2. okay so it's not simply just putting the second derivative in there right we have to account for the fact that as we take derivatives of power functions right the powers come down so we can put that in f double prime of c over 2 times x minus c squared and now you've got yourself a quadratic approximation right and if you wanted to do cubic well it's going to be the same story right the work that we did here it's going to be exactly the same right you follow through the steps because what would happen is that cubic term would be along for the ride right if we were doing it here we'd still have the 3 would come down we'd have 3 b 3 x minus c squared still goes away when you plug in the c x equals c right then you'd come down to here when you did this derivative you'd have the 2 a 2 you'd have a 3 times 2 times b3 times x minus c so again it goes away when you get to the third derivative what you're going to find is that c triple prime of x or if you like um because i shouldn't have used c c and c oh well you're going to get it's going to be 3 times 2 times b3 okay and you'd want that to be equal to f triple prime at c so you work that out and you'd find that okay so c the cubic approximation should be should be f of c f prime of c x minus c f double prime of c over two times x minus c squared and then f triple prime over six times x minus c cubed okay and then you got the cubic approximation and and from here you start thinking you try to figure out what's the pattern where is this going to go from here once you figure out what the pattern is you can write down this general formula for what are called taylor polynomials and we'll do that in the next video all right so now we come to the definition of a taylor polynomial okay so we in the last video we kind of played around we started with the linear approximation and then we asked ourselves you know what if we wanted to move to quadratic approximation what if we wanted to move to a cubic what would the coefficients of those polynomials look like right so you try to generalize that pattern and what you come up with is the definition of a taylor polynomial so the notation that's used in the apex textbooks is just p sub n sometimes you'll see additional decorations here in the subscript you might see p sub n you might see a comma f to indicate the function f you might see a comma c to indicate the point c most of the time we hope that that's clear from the context and just write simply p sub n so p n of x right is going to be f of c plus f prime of c times x minus c there's the linear approximation next term f double prime at c over 2. and i'm going to write that 2 as a 2 factorial you'll see why it helps us follow a pattern x minus c squared and we keep going all the way down to a degree n term so we use brackets to indicate derivative right so the n in the bracket means nth derivative nth derivative at c divide by n factorial multiplied by x minus c to the nth power right so the last power that you have is the degree n term right so if it's degree zero well it's just a number that's not very interesting the degree one taylor polynomial is the linear approximation the degree two taylor polynomial is the quadratic approximation right uh and then degree three and so on you can go up to well really any degree that you want okay so that's your taylor polynomial um if you like you can write this in summation notation as the sum k going from 0 to n of the kth derivative at c divided by k factorial times x minus c to the k right and for for those of you that are watching this in the context of sequences in series you've seen power series and so you can probably guess what's going to happen next you let this sum go not to n we're not going to stop at a polynomial we're going to go all the way to a power series we're going to let k go from 0 to infinity and then you have a taylor series right those of you who are seeing this in calculus 1 you're going to stop at degree n right we haven't talked about sequences in series yet okay so that's the formula for taylor polynomials right um that factorial just as a reminder right k factorial is notation for the product of the first k integers so 1 times 2 and so on up to k right so 1 factorial is just 1 2 factorial 1 times 2 which is 2 3 factorial 1 times 2 times 3 which is 6. we saw that in the in the last video for the cubic and so on right and these factorials they grow very fast right 4 factorial 24 not so big 5 factorial 120 6 factorial 720 right 7 factorial is like 5040 right 8 factorial now you're into like the 40 thousands right they they grow very big very fast okay to make this formula work there's a there's a convention right that zero factorial is defined to be one um right so that you can write all the terms there are other reasons why zero factorial should be one other than making the formula work but at this point in your career you can tell yourself that's why if if you like and of course the whole point of this taylor polynomial is that for k equal to 0 1 2 all the way up to n if you take k derivatives of this polynomial and you plug in c you are going to get the same result as taking k derivatives of your original function and plugging in c right the reason you have these factorials is that as you take derivatives right using the power rule right the first time you take the derivative n comes down in front then an n minus 1 then an n minus 2 and so on right until you've taken n derivatives and at that point you've got an n factorial out front that cancels with the n factorial here leaves you with the nth derivative at c all right by that time all the other terms are lower degrees so they've all disappeared when you take the derivative right and of course if you if you only take if you've taken fewer than n derivatives there's still going to be a an x minus c left in there so when you plug in x equals c you get a zero and those higher order terms they go away as well right so it works out so the idea here is that you want the derivatives of your polynomial to match the derivatives of your function and when you do that you find that the values of your polynomial agree very well with the values of your function at least over some interval right eventually they're going to diverge but over some interval they're going to agree right if you are in the context of looking at series right um we'll see later on that as you add more terms the approximation gets better and it gets better over a bigger interval so if you add infinitely many terms well maybe you actually get exact agreement everywhere right that's the goal of taylor series which you're going to see one last note is that if you put c equal to zero you get what are called um maclaurin polynomials okay so frequently in a lot of problems you'll be working with maclaurin polynomials just because they're simpler right instead of bringing in powers of say x minus 2 or x minus 3 or something like that you just work in powers of x right so maclaurin polynomials are going to look like you know f of 0 f prime of 0 times x f double prime of 0 over 2 times x squared and so on right so you deal with powers of x and they're they're a little bit simpler okay so that's how we define taylor polynomials it's time to look at some examples where we try to compute these and see how this example works in practice all right let's start with an example here kind of a standard relatively simple example um computing taylor polynomials and we'll hope that this example illustrates a couple of things one how the process works how you come up with the taylor polynomial how you sort of identify patterns and then generalize right um degree n right if we wanted like degree 100 we're not going to calculate 100 derivatives we want to figure out what's going on the other is is sort of the reason that we care about taylor polynomials sort of right and the point is that functions like the exponential function uh we we tend not to think about this these days because we have calculators and computers that will give us the values of these functions right for any x value that we want for any degree of accuracy that we want um we just get it out of a machine right but well one there's the question of how do the machines come up with those values right how are they programmed to compute these things uh you know and and how did people figure this out before they had calculators in computers right because people have been working with exponential functions for a very long time and well back in the day instead of calculators what people had were huge books full of tables of values um telling them you know if you wanted to know the value of e at 1.6 you could find you go through the book you'd look it up in the table and you would get the value right um this is what you had to do right and and how did people make those books how did they fill them out how they calculate them well they didn't have calculators available right so they had to do computations that could be done by hand polynomial calculations can be done by hand right we you know all is involved in in computing polynomials is powers products and sums right or differences right so it's all basic you know to compute a polynomial you need only basic arithmetic right and basic arithmetic in principle can be done by hand if you're patient enough all right so you imagine that maybe maybe you've learned all about the exponential function you know what its derivatives are and things like that you've but somehow you've made it this far in your calculus career without actually ever learning the value of e well let's see how you might come up with it so first we're going to try to compute the general degree n maclaurin polynomial right and so remember maclaurin means that we're doing a taylor polynomial with this c value set to zero right so f x is e to the x right f prime of x is e to the x f double prime of x is e to the x and well okay you get the idea right nothing happens when you take derivatives of the exponential function okay so f of zero is one f prime of zero is one f double prime of zero is one right in fact all the derivatives of the exponential function are equal to one at zero okay so our maclaurin polynomial p n we know that the definition looks like this f of zero plus f prime of zero times x plus f double prime of zero over two factorial times x squared uh you know what let's go to f triple prime for good measure why not f triple prime at zero over three factorial times x cubed and so on down to that last derivative over n factorial times x to the n but now we know all these derivatives are just one so what we get is one plus x plus x squared over 2 factorial plus x cubed over 3 factorial and so on down to x to the n over n factorial right which is a fairly nice simple pattern easy enough to follow right if you want you could use summation notation right and write this as x to the k over k factorial those of you who are looking at sequences in series let n go to infinity here and what you will have is actually a series representation for the exponential function and what we're going to see is that's actually valid for all real numbers um so replace that n by infinity and this is e to the x exactly equal to e to the x but if you truncate if you stop at some point you only have an approximation of e to the x right so the idea is the more terms you add the better the approximation gets right and the closer you state is zero the better your approximation will be okay so how do we approximate e well what is e e is f of one okay now it says use p5 okay so how is that going to work so what that means is we want to say that e is f of 1 and you know the whole point of these taylor polynomials is they're supposed to approximate the original function so f of 1 should be approximately p5 of 1 right and this approximation should in theory be better than the linear approximation okay so what's p5 at 1 well we go up to degree 5 we set x equal to 1 so that's a 1 that's a 1 that's a one the next so we have one plus a half plus one over three factorial plus one over four factorial plus 1 over 5 factorial if you want to work those out you get up to there okay and if you want to go a little bit further you can get everything all over a common denominator 120 plus 60 plus 20 plus 5 plus 1 over 120 okay so 180 200 206 is that right probably did something wrong a good chance i did something wrong but so we get we had something like this right um yeah okay um and then we say okay what is that approximately here's where i think this is wrong because i think that's less than two right and then what we should be getting here is two point so that the decimal value should be 2.71 667 something like that um which is why i think i made a mistake um ignore this part i've done something wrong there that part's fine okay so we get this value 2.7 something which is pretty good the calculator value if you ask the calculator to give you e up to up to four four four or five decimal places what you're gonna get is and again it's only approximate because it goes on forever um but you get like 2.71818 i think is how e starts okay um so so this approximation is is pretty good right first two decimal places are accurate we're off by two in the third decimal place and and if we added more terms well our approximation would would keep getting better and better oh ha i know what's wrong i fixed it what did i miss one plus one i'm not wrong i just have to add in a term so that's not 206 it's 326. divide by 120 and yeah that gives you that 2.7 okay so as a means of approximation it's pretty good what we still have to do is we have to figure out whether we can get some idea of a quantifying this approximation do we know ahead of time if we don't know that value do i know whether or not that's a good approximation we need some means of testing right that's going to come later let's do another example this time we're going to go with a slightly more complicated function right um we did the exponential function last time so maybe a little bit too easy because you know we don't have to do any work to compute the derivatives i've done the first four derivatives here just to get us started right and obviously there's a little bit more work involved than there was for the exponential function but we might also notice that these derivatives if we're looking carefully they follow a bit of a pattern right so we look and we see what kind of patterns can we see ignoring the first one let's look down here we notice that we have positive negative positive negative right the signs alternate and you can kind of see that the signs are going to keep alternating because the minus signs are coming from these exponents coming down from the power rule right so every time the exponent comes down we're going to get another minus sign because the exponent's getting more and more and more negative right also every time we take a derivative we're multiplying by the next biggest number right so when we get to the fifth derivative we're gonna multiply by minus four so the minus sign goes away and now we have two times three times four which is four factorial right three factorial two factorial one factorial so this is this kind of idea of you're looking for these patterns right you so and you might have to sit and think about this for a while but eventually you work out that okay once i've done k derivatives okay well i'm going to have an x to the minus k right minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 minus 4. and we have that factorial in front okay but it's one less than the exponent right k minus 1 factorial with a k there right it's always one less but there's one thing missing right what's missing i'm missing a sine factor how do i account for that sine factor well the standard way we do this is we use powers of minus one right an even power of minus one we're multiplying by one and even number of times gonna be positive odd number of times negative okay so we say okay can we just do minus 1 to the k multiply by minus 1 k times well we look at this we say that doesn't quite work right because look it's positive here when k is odd it's negative here when k is even right and that's going to give me the wrong sign so i could put another minus sign out front or we just shift this exponent either add or subtract 1. it doesn't really matter but maybe you like this to match that k minus 1 factorial so we put the k minus 1 out front okay and now that means that when we put x equal to 1 okay let's just do this for now put the denominator in soon we've got minus 1 to the k minus 1 times k minus 1 factorial times 1 to the minus k and of course 1 to any power is just 1. so what we have here is just minus 1 to the k minus 1. times k minus 1 factorial okay but we know that when we when we set up our taylor polynomial we're going to divide by k factorial right so if we do k derivatives evaluate at one divided by k factorial we've got 1 to the k minus 1 k minus 1 factorial over factorial okay now that simplifies right think about what you've got there k minus 1 factorial over k factorial this is 1 times 2 times three and so on up to k minus one on the bottom is one times two times three and so on up to k minus one and then times k right so pretty much everything cancels right 2's cancel the 3's cancel the 4's cancel the k minus 1's cancel all you're left with here is 1 over k so what we get is minus 1 to the k minus 1 over k right and of course you could also you know if you didn't see that you can do it by plugging in x equals one look at the pattern for for f for the derivatives evaluated at one and then go from there okay so that means that our degree n taylor polynomial is going to look like this now remember that because we're doing this at 1 we're not going to expand in powers of x like we did for the maclaurin polynomial we're going to expand in powers of x minus 1. okay so um f of one what's f f of one is zero right log of one is zero so we start with zero plus um f prime is one times x minus 1 f double prime minus 1 times x minus 1 squared right then plus one oh sorry one half there right minus one from here but then we had to divide by the by the two factorial so minus one over two right and then 1 3 right because we have that 2 factorial over 3 factorial leaves me with the 1 3 x minus 1 cubed and so on all right minus 1 to the k minus 1 over k times x minus 1 to the k there's your degree and taylor polynomial okay so now p6 in particular right if i wanted to approximate the natural log of 1.5 right i would say okay so p6 at 1.5 is going to be well it's going to be 1 times so 1.5 minus 1 is a half minus a half times a half squared plus a third times a half cubed minus a quarter times a half to the fourth plus a fifth times a half to the fifth minus a sixth times a half to the sixth okay now if you actually work that fraction out and you simplify you get it over a common denominator what you get is 259 over 6 40 or approximately what is it going to be i wrote it down over there 0.40 and if you compare the the actual value for the natural log of 1.5 if you look it up using your your calculator you're going to get 0.4055 not bad accurate to two decimal places we're only off by one in the third decimal place seems okay all right now um if you go ahead and you calculate um p6 at two well then those powers of onehalf they disappear right you're just gonna have one it's just gonna be one because we're gonna do powers of one right two minus one just gives me one so we get that okay and so this works out to 37 over 60 or approximately 0.6167 okay and you might hope that hey we're going to we're going to get this great approximation again but this time well the best we do is the first decimal place okay the actual value 6931 actually i guess if you round you don't even have the first decimal place all right um so that's not very good right so again we see that even even once you go to like a higher degree polynomial it might still happen that as your delta x grows right as the change in x grows the error in using these to approximate it's going to grow with the size of delta x and depending on the function it might grow faster or slower for the exponential function it's actually not that bad as you add more and more terms your approximation gets pretty good pretty fast the natural log it turns out and we'll we'll see this if we look at some other some other sort of analysis techniques the natural log takes a really really really long time um to give you a good approximation once you go out to two or further out even if we went to like 100 terms we still wouldn't be all that satisfied with our approximation so things really depend on the function for these taylor polynomial approximations in this next example we're just going to compute a couple of maclaurin polynomials the point of this example is is to illustrate something that's going to be useful for you if you are going to use a lot of taylor polynomials and especially if you're doing taylor series one of the things that comes up is you need ways to kind of do these things efficiently right you can't be sitting there all day taking derivative after derivative after derivative until you spot a pattern right these things they tend to get pretty messy and so far we've only looked at relatively simple functions right once the functions get more complicated maybe the pattern doesn't emerge right away and maybe the derivatives get really messy really fast are there other techniques that you can use turns out yes you're going to see some of those once you learn how to you know manipulate series taking derivatives and antiderivatives of series there are some tricks that you can do there right if you're seeing this in calc 1 you don't have those tricks up your sleeves but there's still some basic things that you can notice if you start playing around with some of these examples like this one here so for part a well we don't know what's going on with the sine functions so we just start taking derivatives and we see what happens right so f of x is sine f prime of x is is cos f double prime is negative sine the third derivative is negative cosine and once we get the fourth derivative right where we're back where we started all right so not as simple as the exponential function but there's still a pattern right cycle repeats every four derivatives right so once you know how to do you know up to p3 you kind of have some idea of how it's going to go from there right so we start computing f of zero is zero f prime of zero cosine of zero is one okay f double prime of zero is 0 again f triple prime of 0 is minus 1. okay and from there the pattern is going to repeat right so the coefficients are always going to go 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 minus 1. so you know in fact if we wanted to we could say hey let's do the degree n maclaurin polynomial right and it's going to look like well maybe we say something like 2n plus 1 right because the even degree terms don't show up the coefficient is 0. so what we're going to get is something that looks like x right 1 times x minus so there's no x squared term so the next term is going to be x cubed over 3 factorial there's no degree 4 term all right so the next one is x to the 5 right so the next derivative is going to be cosine again which is derivative is 1 over 5 factorial so you have x to the 5 over 5 factorial right and if we wanted degree 5 we're done otherwise going to 7 and why not there's 7 factorial and what does this look like you know at the end so if we think of this in terms of you know n this is 2 times 0 plus 1 degree 1 2 times one plus one two times two plus one two times three plus one right so in general we get an x to the 2 times n plus 1 over 2 n plus 1 factorial and what about the signs um plus signs for 0 2 next would be 4 and so on minus signs for 1 3 next would be 5. so plus signs when n is even minus signs when n is odd so we should have a minus 1 to the n out front okay well that's not so bad now degree 10 maclaurin polynomial for sine of x squared right so this gets a little bit trickier because now we've got chain rule with the derivatives and i need 10 of them all right and of course the point of this exercise is for us to realize at the end that we didn't have to do this but you've got to do it once before you before you realize that okay so 2x cos x squared right second derivative okay product rule now 2 cos x squared all right and then minus so we've got to do uh 4 x squared sine x squared right derivative of cos becomes negative sine x squared on the inside multiply by the derivative 2x times the 2x that's already there all right okay and by now you're probably getting concerned that i said i wanted to go all the way to 10 derivatives let's let's do a couple more okay derivative of cos is negative sign right 2x is going to come up minus 4x sine x squared okay minus 8x sine x squared so i guess let's just combine let's try to speed things up here 12x and then 4x squared times the derivative of sine cos there's another 2x 8x cubed cos x squared okay fourth derivative we're going to get minus 12 sine of x squared huh okay minus 12x cos theta so minus 24 x squared i want another 24 so actually 48 x squared cos x squared okay and then derivative cos is negative sine minus minus plus 16x to the four you tired of this yet i'm tired of this should we keep going maybe one more i don't know if i even want to do one more yeah let's do two more okay um minus 12 derivative sign is cos with a 2x so minus 24x x squared um plus okay a whole bunch of other stuff that i'm not going to do all right but it's all going to have x's in it and x is going to be set to zero right we're doing maclaurin i just want to point out that the next one g6 is going to have minus 24 cos x squared in it and some other stuff okay so g of 0 is 0. g prime of 0 0 g double prime of 0 i get something i get 2. g triple prime is 0 4th derivative 0 5th derivative 0 the sixth derivative is minus 24 okay which happens to be minus 4 factorial not that you were keeping score um okay i'll i'll i'll tell you what's going to happen next uh the seventh derivative and the eighth derivative and the ninth derivatives if you if you care to keep going they're all going to be zero the tenth derivative it won't be zero okay the tenth derivative well it's going to give us a number um we got to figure it out but we're not going to go all that way let me just tell you what happens because this is already kind of we're pushing 10 minutes here um what we're going to get for my p5 and x okay it's going to be so the first nonzero thing is here two so two over two factorial those cancel right two over two factorial times x squared i get x squared the next one is here at six minus four factorial over 6 factorial okay times x to the sixth now the next term i'm going to get is going to be as we said there's going to be an x to the 10 okay should be dividing by 10 factorial right but what we're going to find is that in the end there's only five factorial left over okay so what you actually get for x to the 10 here it turns out what you're going to get is it's going to be 10 factorial divided by 5 factorial is is the number that's going to come out um okay does that work yeah yeah okay um so and so the point of this is four factorial of two factorial um that that should simplify right uh yeah let me make sure i got this right yeah should be should just leave with a six i might have made some mistakes here what you should get is you replace x by x squared everywhere so you get x squared and then you get 1 over 3 factorial so this should be a 5 factorial times x squared cubed plus 1 over 5 factorial times x squared to the fifth and so on and so actually all you have to do is replace x by x squared and the one that you already have and you get the next one along the way okay um i've almost certainly made some calculation errors here not surprising given what i'm dealing with right it's it's a bit of a mess um you can sort of see how this might happen but you should end up with something that looks like that right so you can kind of you start playing around you start learning these tricks um you can plug one thing into another sometimes doesn't always work out but you definitely do not want to sit down and calculate 10 derivatives of this of sine of x squared using using the chain rule that's going to be a terrible mess right um if you see something like that you have to guess that probably there was a better way to do it all right so we've been looking at taylor polynomials and we've looked at a number of examples which have suggested that going beyond the linear approximation for your function at a given point c to higher order polynomial approximations gives you better results over a wider range of values right so remember that our taylor polynomial right looks like f of a plus f prime of a or sorry c we're doing c for our interval times x minus c there's the linear approximation right um plus these higher order terms right which all come by taking higher and higher order derivatives evaluating at that point c we divide by this factorial and we multiply by the corresponding power of x minus c okay and we've seen that there are some functions like for example trigonometric functions where these taylor polynomials actually approximate very well over a fairly wide range of values there are other functions like natural logarithm where these don't work as well as you might like right over a small range of interval a small range of values not too bad but there's always a point where you move just a little bit further away and and suddenly the approximation is terrible and it doesn't matter how many terms you add to your taylor polynomial it doesn't really seem to improve all that much okay so what the next step here is is once you've established your approximation you want to know how good your approximation is right and and keep in mind that you might be doing this in some scenario where you don't necessarily know how to compute the function exactly right because we have graphing calculators and computers and things that give us quite precise values for these functions we sort of sometimes fail to appreciate why something like taylor's theorem is useful taylor's theorem is useful because you might be in a scenario where you don't actually know how to compute the function precisely but you can compute tailored polynomials right or some other kind of approximation for your function and let's say you want to know the value of your function accurate up to let's say six decimal places because that's what you're going to display well then you need to be able to figure out how many terms do you need to put in your polynomial to give the value accurate to six decimal places at a particular point right so at a particular value of x how big does n have to be before i know i've got six decimal places right so you might need to solve these problems taylor's theorem gives you one means of doing so okay so taylor's theorem says that as long as you've got enough continuous derivatives right so if you want to use a degree n taylor polynomial you need this derivative but you also need the next one okay you need n plus one continuous derivatives as long as you've got enough continuous derivatives you can write your function as the taylor polynomial plus a remainder right so notice it's equals here it's not an approximation it's equals right this remainder right this should be thought of here as sort of your error term right it's telling you you know the difference right if i move this if i subtract that over it's giving you the difference between the original function and the taylor polynomial right so typically what we're interested in here is we're interested in actually the absolute value of this remainder right and then often at a particular point where we're where we're evaluating things um and so if you're looking at this you realize that okay well this is just a constant i don't need to worry about that right there there is there's a couple of things here that you have to watch out for um well i mean you have this term but actually this it's it's not as as as difficult to deal with as you might think because for whatever problem you're doing with you've chosen c in advance right you choose the point where you're centering your taylor polynomial and now we're trying to decide for a given x how good is our approximation so we've chosen our x uh the only other wild card here is this t right um now this particular remainder here this is what's called the lagrange form of the remainder it's one of actually there's like often three different forms that you find for this remainder three different remainder formulas um the first one is is derived using sort of integration arguments and it's quite tricky to get to but once you have that first one then there are sort of mean value theorem arguments that you can make to arrive at simpler remainder formulas and so this t here all we know about t is that it's in this interval that we're working on actually you can you can say a little bit more it's it's between if you want to narrow it down it's between x and c it's somewhere in between those two values right but typical mean value theorem argument you know that this number exists but you don't know what it is right all you know that it exists you know roughly where it's located but you don't know it exactly so what you're doing with taylor's theorem is you're not trying to compute this error this remainder term exactly because of course if you could do it exactly you would know the exact value that's not the point the point is to get some measure of how big this thing can get right when you're dealing with error when you're trying to estimate error right you want a maximum error you want an upper bound right so you want to be able to say look i know that my answer is off by a certain amount and i know that that amount can't be any bigger than this right if it turns out that your error is actually less than what you budgeted for nobody's going to complain right you did better than you than you advertised right you're only going to be in trouble if you advertise that you can do things within a certain error and then it turns out that you're you're much higher than that then you're going to get yourself in trouble so typically what you want to do here is you want to look for what is the biggest value that i can get for this function and we want to look i guess that absolute value right absolute value of this derivative okay and we take that absolute value you know over this interval i we divide by n plus 1 factorial and we multiply by the absolute value of x minus c taken to the n plus first power all right so there's a few things that you realize with this one is that if x is fairly close to c and in particular if the difference between x and c is less than one then this is going to get smaller as n gets bigger right so just being within one of the center of your polynomial is is going to give you some control over this remainder right so staying within a distance of 1 is going to work that's why we saw with like the natural logarithm as long as long as you know we did the log natural log we did the taylor polynomial centered at one and between zero and two we did okay but once we went past two once that difference was bigger than one we had a really bad estimate it wasn't good anymore okay because as soon as this difference is bigger than one it's going to start growing with n right of course it's not going to grow as fast as this factorial so what you're looking for is you're looking for you know making sure that overall this thing is getting smaller than gets bigger and indeed it will right for pretty much any reasonably behaved function is going to get smaller than gets bigger right if you're if you're looking at this in the context of sequences in series right your taylor series is going to have some radius of convergence and as long as you stay within that radius you know that this remainder is going to go to 0 as n goes to infinity okay but if you're just working with polynomials you're doing polynomial approximations then you don't care that it's going to eventually go to infinity right like if if you have to go out to like you know billions or trillions before you start getting a small enough value that's not very practical if you're using this to approximate functions right you want to know that by the time you get to like n equals 10 or 20 this remainder is small enough right you want things to get small relatively quickly otherwise you might be relying on a lot more computational power than you want okay so we're gonna see how this formula is used in the next few videos so we'll do a couple of examples um and then we're gonna move on to the next topic all right so let's look at an example we we looked at this example earlier the the natural logarithm we we use this degree 6 taylor polynomial to approximate the values of you know so we did this for the natural log of 1.5 and we did it for the natural log of 2. and we found that the approximation was not too bad for 1.5 it wasn't very good at all for natural log of 2 right so now we want to kind of look into this remainder and try to understand what's going on so if we were to calculate the seventh derivative of x you would find that you get minus 6 factorial over x to the 7. okay and if we want to center at 1 right we probably want to use we need an interval that contains the center and it needs to contain the point that we want to evaluate so maybe we move like 0.1 either side right so maybe we go like 0.9 to 1.6 right and you could you know in in effect if you wanted to you could probably go with the interval from 1 to 1.5 because this value of t in the remainder formula that you get from taylor's theorem generally it's safe to assume that it's somewhere in between these two values so somewhere between 1 and 1.5 but uh let's go with 0.9 let's see where that gets us right let's let's like is it you know if if we get an error estimate that's too big that's all right that just means we're being a little bit more conservative right that's better than than trying to come up with an error estimate that's smaller so you make yourself look good but then it turns out that maybe you had a bit too small and your error estimate is not actually as accurate as you thought okay so if we if we use this interval and we want the maximum of the absolute value of the seventh derivative for for t in this interval let's call it i right we say well i want to make this thing as big as possible for t in this interval and well x is in the denominator right so if we if we have some reciprocal power of x and we want to make this thing big we should take x as small as possible uh that means we should take x to be 0.9 all right we're taking absolute value so we lose the minus sign so we have 6 factorial over 0.9 to the 7. and if you put that through your calculator you find that this comes out to be about 1506 okay all right if you um if you decided that you wanted to do just t equals 1 right if we went from 1 to 1.5 you'd get 720 which is 6 factorial right so our estimate here is about twice as big all right you think 0.9 is pretty close to one right but once you raise it to a high enough power it definitely has an effect okay so we have this this maximum and so now we know that um if we're if we're interested in the error right our error is going to be well it's going to be given by the remainder at 1.5 and we want the absolute value so we take the absolute value and that remainder is going to be less than or equal to so we have this maximum here and we've just worked out that you know the biggest that we can get on the interval we've chosen is 1506 we divide by 7 factorial and we should actually put in this is our 6 right our 6. so for n equal to 6 we divide by 7 factorial okay and then x minus c c is 1 x is 1.5 1.5 minus 1 gives us 0.5 or one half raised to the seventh power right so that 0.5 to the seventh power that's going to help make sure the error is not too big here right because you know that's that's one over two to the seventh that's getting to a reasonably small number that's one over a thousand right so we get to here and again you can punch this into your calculator by the way for when you're doing these error estimates it's nice to have a you know a decent calculator or even a spreadsheet handy to run the numbers right often in some situations you're plugging in various values of n to figure out which one works and so it's nice to be able to just generate them all and use a spreadsheet something like that so if you punch this through you get that this is something like 0.002 3 right and so what that tells you is that the estimate you get for the natural log of 1.5 right because the error is less than 5 in this spot you know that you're good to two decimal places right because whatever value you got you know you get up to the second decimal place in the third decimal place you're off by you know plus or minus 0.2 um up to rounding that's not enough to shift what you've got in the second decimal place so you're you're fairly happy with that right now if we had gone with the natural log of 2 instead right so then maybe we're going with 0.9 up to maybe 2.1 something like that well actually the only thing that changes the minimum is still going to be down here 0 or the maximum value is still going to be down here 0.9 right so you're still going to have that that 1506 over 7 factorial there but now your x minus c is going to be 2 minus 1. it's 1 to the 7th power right and and so that that this doesn't contribute right it's just 1 to the 7th so that's not going to help shrink the remainder the only thing that really helps shrink the remainder here is that 7 factorial right and you can see that this is this is not going to be very good at all right so 7 factorial is is what like um so seven times it's around five thousand right um so so this is yeah this is around fifteen hundred over five thousand something like that right um so it's less than one but it's bigger than point one so it's it's it's not as good right it's certainly not as good anymore i guess it's three thousand over over ten thousand so uh you know so somewhere around zero point three right which tells you that your answer is you don't necessarily even have the first decimal place right you've got the ones digit okay but that's about it so so here's where you can you can see that this is this is not going to help right and roughly roughly if you kind of play around with this if you think of where this came from right if you go to a higher degree what you're going to have is is the remainder is going to be more or less that that 0.9 factor if you want right you can creep closer to one if you want to kind of get it a bit better but but then even even even if you went with even if you went with one with with t equal to one your best case is going to be still n factorial over n plus 1 factorial which is which is 1 over n plus 1 right so that tells you that you know to get even the first decimal place you're going to need like 10 terms to get the second decimal place you're going to need like 100 terms right three decimal places you need like a thousand terms um so if you're trying to approximate you know log of two this is probably not how you want to do it all right let's look at another example now this is one that you probably shouldn't try to do by hand chances are you want to have a the very least scientific calculator with you even better would be a spreadsheet i'll try to explain why as we get there okay so the the goal here is we want to approximate the cosine function with the maclaurin polynomial and we want to figure out what is the smallest degree that we need if we want to make sure that our approximation it has a certain degree of accuracy when we are approximating cosine of two right so we know that our maclaurin polynomial for cos okay if you work through this example it looks something like this 1 minus x squared over 2 factorial x to the 4 or 4 factorial x to the 6 over 6 factorial x to the 8th over 8 factorial x to the 10 over 10 factorial and so on up to up to whatever you know depending on the degree how far you want to go okay so so that's what the co the taylor polynomial for cosine looks like maclaurin polynomial we're centering at zero we want to figure out how many of these terms do we need to include to get this degree of accuracy right so cos of 2 we'd approximate with pn of 2 so we'd approximate with 1 minus 4 over 2 factorial plus 16 over 4 factorial right minus 64 over 6 factorial and so on we want to try and approximate this so again we rely on taylor's theorem and we say okay i know that that by taylor's theorem i know that the remainder is always going to be less than or equal to this maximum value for the n plus first derivative at some t over n plus 1 factorial right and then this is just simply going to be absolute value of x to the n right because we're we're centering at zero so x minus c just becomes x all right now one of the things that that we know here right is is we know what these derivatives are now of course it depends on n but we know that these these derivatives they cycle right we're going to take the first derivative we get negative sign then negative cos then positive sign then positive cos and then repeat right so every every four derivatives it repeats so we know um well the absolute value eats that plus or minus right so this is either going to be cos t or sine t once you take the absolute value okay and and i haven't written down an interval here i guess we go with something like you know from minus 0.1 up to 2.1 something like that but it doesn't matter because we know that what do we know about these trig functions we know that the absolute value of cos is always less than or equal to one and we know that the same thing is true for sine right it doesn't matter what t is these can never be bigger than one this is the property of sine and cosine functions so that means that regardless of the inter interval that we're working on this maximum can't be bigger than one so the remainder if we're doing this at 2 has to be less than or equal to 1 over n plus 1 factorial times 2 oops sorry to the n plus 1. okay and and now the rest is kind of trial and error computational work plugging in values of n until you find the first n that gives you a small enough value right we want it to be less than 0.001 this is where a spreadsheet is really great because all you do is you take one column and you label it n and you have another column that you label i don't know rn or error or something right and you just fill the values down in fact i think if you put one and you drag it will fill the rest in automatically on a decent spreadsheet right and and then the rn you say okay so what is what is rn you can you can kind of program this into your spreadsheet right you say it's going to be 2 to the power of you know so if this is if this is in like cell maybe this is like a two here right so you're like you're like okay so it's going to be 2 to the power of of a2 divide by um oh plus one right because we add one to the exponent divide by like factorial a2 plus one and then you just copy it down right and when you copy in the spreadsheet it's going to increment this as you copy it down and that's just going to do those calculations for you automatically so you don't have to do it it's great right but of course you can you can do these right you can start working them out so when n is equal to one you get 2 squared over 2 factorial 4 over 2 you get 2 well that's definitely not going to work so you go to n equals 2 2 cubed or 3 factorial 8 over six four thirds uh it's about one point three ish still too big you go to n a equals three two to the four sixteen over four factorial just twenty four that's three quarters so you're at you're at 0.75 right and and you keep you keep working your way down you keep doing these so you go okay n equals 4 uh 32 over over 5 factorial so 32 over over 120 and and you get this is about 0.267 right and then you go to 5 so 5 plus 1 is 6. 64 over 6 factorial so 64 over 720 and you get something like i've got them written then it was written down over there i don't remember these this is now 0.084 getting better right so you keep going for n equals six point zero two five right um six plus one you get two to the seven so we're at like 128 seven factorial is getting you know reading there is like 5040 right but still okay and and now one of the things that you'll notice as you play around these examples is factorials they grow much faster than exponentials right because here you're just multiplying by two each time here the next thing you multiply is bigger than the previous thing all right so you keep going and the next one you get you're doing like 256 divided by like 40 000 and something and you get 0.0 and then you try eight and you got 512 for your for your two to the nine and then you're dividing by nine factorial which is like 362 000 something and you get 0.0014 almost there but not quite right so you say oh we got to go to 9. so we got n equals 9 and for n equals 9 right you get 2 to the 10 over 10 factorial okay so so 2 to the 10 is like is is a thousand thousand twenty four ten factorial is i don't know it's like three three million something right three million in something and and and you do get something which is indeed less than 0.01 so you're like yes i guess i got to go to degree 9. but that's not quite the end of the story because hey here's our here's our polynomial right um the coefficient of x to the nine in the maclaurin polynomial for cos is zero okay so right i can actually stop at eight because the degree nine maclaurin polynomial is the same as the degree 8 maclaurin polynomial right because when you go to degree 9 you're adding 0. nothing changes so in fact um n equals eight will do right and and then maybe you're concerned you're like hey but you know this number was too big like that doesn't make sense how can how can you know we get this much smaller number for n equals 9 than we have here but they're the same polynomial like shouldn't the error be the same and of course the error is the same because remember we don't know this value precisely we're always just going for the worst case scenario was the biggest that it could be right these numbers here are bigger than the actual error right so typically once you get something that's close to the area you're looking for because you're overestimating you're probably already good at n equals eight but sometimes you add one more term just to be safe
